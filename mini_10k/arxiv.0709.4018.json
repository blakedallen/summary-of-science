Introduction\nIn [DKR] we proved that if the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a\nclosed n-manifold, n \u2265 3, equals 2 then the fundamental group of M is\nfree. In opposite direction we proved that if the fundamental group of\nan n-manifold is free, then catLS M \u2264 n\u22122. Then J. Strom proved that\ncatLS X \u2264 32 n for every n-complex, n > 4, with free fundamental group\n[St]. Yu. Rudyak suggested that the coefficient 2/3 in Strom's result\nshould be improved to 1/2. Precisely, he conjectured that the function\nf defined as f (n) = max{catLS M n } is asymptotically 21 n where the\nmaximum is taken over all closed n-manifolds with free fundamental\ngroup.\nIn this paper we prove Rudyak's conjecture. Our method gives the\nsame estimate for n-complexes. Moreover, it gives the same asymptotic\nupper bound for catLS of n-complexes with the fundamental group of\ncohomological dimension \u2264 2. In view of this the following generalization of Rudyak's conjecture seems to be natural.\nCONJECTURE. For every k the function fk defined as\nfk (n) = max{catLS M n | cd(\u03c01 (M n ) \u2264 k}\nis asymptotically 21 n.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV\n\nThe smallest k when it is unknown is 3.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is an introduction to\nthe Lusternik-Schnirelmann category based on an analogy with the\ndimension theory. Section 3 contains a version of a fibration theorem\nfor catLS . In Section 4 this fibration theorem is applied for the proof\nof Rudyak's conjecture.\n2. Kolmogorov-Ostrand's approach to the\nLusternik-Schnirelmann category\nAn open cover U = {Ui } of a topological space X is called Xcontractible if each Ui can be contracted to a point in X. By the\ndefinition catLS X \u2264 n if there is an X-contractible cover of X by n + 1\nelements.\nWe recall [CLOT] that a sequence \u2205 = O0 \u2282 O1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 On+1 = X is\ncalled categorical of length n + 1 if each difference Oi+1 \\ Oi is contained\nin an open set that contracts to a point. It was proven in [CLOT] that\ncatLS X \u2264 n if and only if X admits a categorical sequence of length\nn + 1.\nLet U be a family of open set in a topological space X. The multiplicity of U (or the order) at a point x \u2208 X, Ordx U is the number\nof elements of U that contain x. The multiplicity of U is defined as\nOrd U = supx\u2208X Ordx U. We recall that the covering dimension of a\ntopological space X does not exceed n, dim X \u2264 n, if for every open\ncover C of X there is an open refinement U with Ord U \u2264 n + 1.\nThe following proposition makes the LS-category analogous to the\ncovering dimension.\n2.1. Proposition. For a paracompact topological space X, catLS X \u2264 n\nif and only if X admits an X-contractible locally finite open cover V\nwith OrdV \u2264 n + 1.\nProof. If catLS X \u2264 n then by the definition X admits an open contractible cover that consists of n + 1 elements and therefore its multiplicity is at most n + 1.\nLet V be a contractible cover of X of multiplicity \u2264 n + 1. We\nconstruct a categorical sequence O0 \u2282 O1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 On+1 of length n+ 1.\nWe define O1 = {x \u2208 X | Ordx V} = n + 1. Note that O1 = \u222aVi \u2208V V0 \u2229\n* * * \u2229 Vn . Note that this is the disjoint union and every nonempty\nsummand is X-contractible. Thus O1 is X-contractible. Next, we\ndefine O2 = {x \u2208 X | Ordx V \u2265 n}. Then O2 \\ O1 = cupVi \u2208V (V1 \u2229 * * * \u2229\nVn \\ O1 ) is a disjoint union of closed in O2 subsets. Since this family\nis locally finite, we can take open (in O2 and hence in X) disjoint\nneighborhoods of these summands V1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Vn \\ O1 such that each of\n\n\fON THE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF SPACES WITH2-DIMENSIONAL FUNDAMENTAL GR\n\nwhich is contained in an open contractible set from V. Define O3 =\n{x \u2208 X | Ordx \u2265 n \u2212 1} as the union of n \u2212 1-fold intersections and so\non. On+1 is the union of elements of V (1-fold intersections) and hence\nOn+1 = X. Clearly, for every k, Ok+1 \\ Ok is the union of disjoint sets\neach of which is contained in an element of V. Thus, the categorical\nsequence conditions are satisfied.\n\u0003\nA family U of subsets of X is called a k-cover, k \u2208 N if every\nsubfamily of k elements form a cover of X. The following is obvious.\n2.2. Proposition. A family U of m-elements is an (n + 1)-cover of X\nif and only if Ordx U \u2265 m \u2212 n for all x \u2208 X.\nProof. If Ordx U < m\u2212n for some x \u2208 X, then n+ 1 = m\u2212(m\u2212n) + 1\nelements of U do not cover x.\nIf n + 1 elements of U do not cover some x, then Ordx U \u2264 m \u2212 (n +\n1) < m \u2212 n.\n\u0003\nInspired by the work of Kolmogorov on Hilbert's 13 problem Ostrand\ngave the following characterization of the covering dimension [Os].\n2.3. Theorem (Ostrand). A metric space X is of dimension \u2264 n if\nand only if for each open cover C of X and each integer m \u2265 n + 1,\nthere exist m discrete families of open sets U1 , * * * , Uk such that their\nunion \u222aUi is an (n + 1)-cover of X.\nLet U be a family of subsets in X and let A \u2282 X. We denote by\nU|A \u2212 {U \u2229 A | U \u2208 U}.\n2.4. Definition. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a map. An open cover U =\n{U0 , U1 , . . . , Un } of X is called uniformly f -contractible if it satisfies\nthe property that for every y \u2208 Y there is a neighborhood V such\nthat the restriction U|f \u22121 (V ) of U to the preimage f \u22121 (V ) consists of\nX-contractible sets.\n2.5. Theorem. Let {U0\u2032 , . . . , Un\u2032 } be an open cover of a normal topological space X. Then there is an infinite open (n + 1)-cover of X,\n\u2032\nn\n{Uk }\u221e\nk=0 such that Uk = Uk for k \u2264 n and Uk = \u222ai=0 Vi is the disjoint\nunion with Vi \u2282 Ui for k > n.\nIn particular, if {U0\u2032 , . . . , Un\u2032 } is X-contractible, the cover {Uk }\u221e\nk=0\nis X-contractible. If {U0\u2032 , . . . , Un\u2032 } is uniformly f -contractible for some\nf : X \u2192 Y , the cover {Uk }\u221e\nk=0 is uniformly f -contractible.\nProof. By induction on m we construct the family {Ui }m\ni=0 . For m = n\nwe take Ui = Ui\u2032 .\nLet U = {U0 , . . . , Um } be the corresponding family for m \u2265 n. Consider Y = {x \u2208 X | Ordx U \u2264 m \u2212 n}. In view of Proposition 2.2 and\n\n\f4\n\nA. DRANISHNIKOV\n\nthe assumption, it is a closed subset. We show that for every i \u2264 n,\nthe set Y \u2229 Ui is closed in X. Let x be a limit point of Y \u2229 Ui that\ndoes not belong to Ui . Let Ui0 , . . . , Uim\u2212n be the elements that contain\nx. Then Ordy U = m \u2212 n + 1 for all y \u2208 Y \u2229 Ui \u2229 Ui0 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Uim\u2212n .\nContradiction.\nWe define recursively F0 = Y \u2229 U1 and Fi+1 = Y \u2229 Ui+1 \\ (\u222aik=0 Ui ).\nNote that {Fi } is a disjoint finite family of closed subsets. We fix\ndisjoint open neighborhoods Vi of Fi with Vi \u2282 Ui . We define Um+1 =\n\u222ai Vi . In view of Proposition 2.2, U1 , . . . , Um , Um+1 is an (n + 1)-cover.\nClearly, if all Ui are X-contractible, i \u2264 n, then Um+1 is X-contractible.\nIf all Ui are uniformly f -contractible, for some f : X \u2192 Y , then Um+1\nis uniformly f -contractible.\n\u0003\n2.6. Corollary. For a normal topological space X, catLS X \u2264 n if and\nonly if for any m > n X admits an open (n+1)-cover by X-contractible\nsets.\nThis corollary is a catLS -analog of Ostrand's theorem. It also can be\nfound in [CLOT] with further reference to [Cu].\n3. Fibration theorems for catLS\n3.1. Definition. The \u2217-category catLS \u2217 f of a map f : X \u2192 Y is the\nminimal n, if exists, such that there is a uniformly f -contractible open\ncover U = {U0 , U1 , . . . , Un } of X.\nNote that catLS \u2217 c = catLS X for a constant map c : X \u2192 pt. More\ngenerally, catLS \u2217 \u03c0 = catLS X for the projection \u03c0 : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y .\n3.2. Theorem. The inequality catLS X \u2264 dim Y + catLS \u2217 f holds true\nfor any continuous map.\nProof. The requirements to the spaces in the theorem are that the\nOstrand theorem holds true for Y , i.e. are fairly general (say, Y is\nnormal).\nLet dim Y = n and catLS \u2217 f = m. Let U = {U0 , . . . Um } be a uniformly f -contractible cover. For all y \u2208 Y denote by Vy a neighborhood of y from the definition of the uniform f -contractibility. In\nview of Ostrand's characterization of dimension there is a refinement\nV = V0 \u222a* * *\u222aVn+m of the cover {Vy | y \u2208 Y } such that each family Vi is\ndisjoint. Let Vi = \u222aVi . We apply Theorem 2.5 to extend the family U\nto a family {U0 , . . . , Un+m }. Consider the family W = {f \u22121 (Vi ) \u2229 Ui }.\nNote that it is contractible in X. We show that it is a cover of X.\nAccording to the Ostrand theorem every y \u2208 Y is covered by m + 1\nelements Vi0 , . . . , Vim . By Theorem 2.5 the family Ui0 , . . . , Uim covers\nthe fiber f \u22121 (y).\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF SPACES WITH2-DIMENSIONAL FUNDAMENTAL GR\n\n3.3. Corollary (Corollary 9.35 [CLOT], [OW]). Let p : X \u2192 Y be a\nclosed map of ANE. If each fiber p\u22121 (y) is contractible in X, then\ncatLS X \u2264 dim Y .\nProof. In this case catLS \u2217 p = 0. Indeed, since X is an ANE, a contraction of p\u22121 (y) to a point can be extended to a neighborhood U.\nSince the map p is closed there is a neighborhood V of y such that\np\u22121 (V ) \u2282 U.\n\u0003\n\u0003\nWe recall that the homotopical dimension of a space X, hd(X), is\nthe minimal dimension of a CW -complex homotopy equivalent to X\n[CLOT].\nThe elementary obstruction theory implies the following.\n3.4. Proposition. Let p : E \u2192 X be a fibration with n \u2212 1-connected\nfiber where n = hd(X).

Let catLS Y = m and hd(X) = n.\nLet s : Y \u2192 X be a section. We apply the fiber-wise Serre construction to f with this s(y) as the base points.

Note that \u03bek is a\nHurewicz fibration with the fiber the join product \u2217k+1 \u03a9F of k + 1\ncopies of the loop space \u03a9F . Thus, it is (k +(k +1)r \u22121)-connected.

Clearly, \u03c3(x)i is a continuous function.\nA section \u03c3 : X \u2192 Ek defines a cover U = {U0 , . . . , Uk } of X as\nfollows:\nUi = {x \u2208 X | \u03c3(x)i > 0}.\nLet {U0 , . . . , Um+k } be an extension of U to an (k + 1)-cover of X from\nTheorem 2.5.\nLet V = {V0 , . . . Vm+k } be an open Y -contractible (m + 1)-cover of\nY . We show that the sets Wi = f \u22121 (Vi ) \u2229 Ui are contractible in X\nfor all i. By the construction of Ui for i \u2264 n for every x \u2208 Ui there\nis a canonical path connecting x with sf (x). We use these paths to\ncontract f \u22121 (Vi ) \u2229 Ui to s(Vi ) in X. Then we apply a contraction of\ns(Vi ) to a point in s(Y ). If i > k, we apply the last condition of the\nfirst part of Theorem 2.5.\nSimilarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.2 we show that {Wi }m+k\ni=0 is\na cover of X. Since V is an (m + 1)-cover, by Proposition 2.2 every\ny \u2208 Y is covered by at least k + 1 elements Vi0 , . . . , Vik of V. By the\nconstruction Ui0 , . . . , Uik is a cover of X. Hence Wi0 , . . . , Wik covers\nf \u22121 (y).\n\u0003\n4. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of complexes\nwith low dimensional fundamental groups\n4.1. Theorem. For every complex X with cd(\u03c01 (X)) \u2264 2 the following\ninequality holds true:\n\u0018\n\u0019\nhd(X) \u2212 1\ncatLS X \u2264 cd(\u03c01 (X)) +\n.\n2\nProof. Let \u03c0 = \u03c01 (X). We consider Borel's construction\nX\u0303 \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212 X\u0303 \u00d7 E\u03c0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\ng\n\nf\n\nE\u03c0\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nX \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212 X\u0303 \u00d7\u03c0 E\u03c0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 B\u03c0.\nWe claim that there is a section s : B\u03c0 \u2192 X\u0303 \u00d7\u03c0 E\u03c0 of f . By the\ncondition cd\u03c0 \u2264 2 we may assume that B\u03c0 is a complex of dimension\n\u2264 3. Since a fiber of f is simply connected, there is a lift of the 2skeleton. The condition cd\u03c0 \u2264 2 implies H 3 (B\u03c0, E) = 0 for every\n\u03c0-module. Thus, we have no obstruction for the lift of the 3-skeleton.\nWe apply Theorem 3.5 to obtain the inequality\n&\n'\nhd(X\u0303 \u00d7\u03c0 E\u03c0) \u2212 1\ncatLS X \u2264 catLS (B\u03c0) +\n.\n2\n\n\fON THE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF SPACES WITH2-DIMENSIONAL FUNDAMENTAL GR\n\nSince g is a fibration with the homotopy trivial fiber, the space X\u0303 \u00d7\u03c0 E\u03c0\nis homotopy equivalent to X. Thus, hd(X\u0303 \u00d7\u03c0 E\u03c0) = hd(X). Note that\ncatLS B\u03c0 = cd\u03c0.\n\u0003\n4.2. Corollary. For every complex X with free fundamental group:\n\u0019\n\u0018\ndim X \u2212 1\n.\ncatLS X \u2264 1 +\n2\nNote that this estimate is sharp on X = S 1 \u00d7 CP n .\n\n4.3. Corollary. For every 3-dimensional complex X with free fundamental group: catLS X \u2264 2.\nThis Corollary can be also derived from the fact that in the case of\nfree fundamental group every 2-complex is homotopy equivalent to the\nwedge of circles and 2-spheres [KR].\nIt is unclear whether the estimate catLS X \u2264 2 + \u2308 dim 2X\u22121 \u2309 is sharp\nfor complexes with cd(\u03c01 (X)) = 2. It is sharp when the answer to the\nfollowing question is affirmative.\n4.4. Question. Does there exists a 4-complex K with free fundamental\ngroup and with catLS (K \u00d7 S 1 ) = 4?\n\u2309.\nIndeed, for X = K \u00d7 S 1 we would have the equality 4 = 2 + \u2308 5\u22121\n2\nNote that cd(\u03c0( X)) = 2. There is a connection between this question\nand the Problem 1.5 from [DKR] which asks whether catLS M 4 \u2264 2 for\nclosed 4-manifolds with free fundamental group.\nReferences\n[CLOT]\n\n[Cu]\n[DKR]\n\n[KR]\n\n[OW]\n[Os]\n[St]\n\nCornea, O.; Lupton, G.; Oprea, J.; Tanr\u00e9, D.: Lusternik-Schnirelmann\ncategory.
