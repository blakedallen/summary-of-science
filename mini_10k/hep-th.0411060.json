The supersymmetric\nWard identities are studied as well.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the most studied examples of the AdS/CF T correspondence is the relation between\nthree-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant and two-dimensional\nConformal Field Theory. Even before the AdS/CF T was discovered, Brown and Henneaux [1] found a deep connection between 3d gravity with anti-de Sitter boundary conditions and the 2d centrally-extended conformal algebra. This connection was then reformulated in [2] as a relationship between three dimensional gravity and Liouville theory\n(and generalized in [3] to supergravity). Within the AdS/CF T correspondence one can\nunderstand this result as a relationship between fluctuations on the AdS background (the\nLiouville field) and vacuum expectation values of the 2d CF T .\nIt is unfortunate that quantum Liouville theory is not fully understood. There are\nquestions one can ask at the gravity side which do not yet have an answer within Liouville\ntheory, e.g., the black hole microstates (see, for example, [4]). Whether or not Liouville\ntheory encodes the necessary information to answer all questions related to 3d dimensional\nquantum gravity is still not known. See [5] for a recent discussion on Liouville theory.\nThe relationship between 3d gravity and Liouville theory discovered in [2] is based\non the fact that three-dimensional gravity does not have any local degrees of freedom.\n1\n\n\fUsing the relationship between Chern-Simons and WZW theories [6, 7] together with the\nHamiltonian reduction technics [8], it was shown in [2] that the (local) relevant dynamical\ninformation is encoded in the Liouville action. From a Hamiltonian point of view, the\nLiouville field describes those \"would-be-trivial\" degrees of freedom associated to diffeomorphisms which preserve the boundary conditions, but have non-zero generators [9].\nOn the other hand, in the general AdS/CF T correspondence[10, 11, 12] the CF T\ncorrelators are computed directly from a classical action on the AdS background. In\nparticular, if one is interested in correlators involving the energy-momentum tensor, the\nneeded action is precisely the (renormalised) gravity action Iren [gij ] \u2261 W [gij ] as a function\nof an arbitrary induced boundary metric gij which acts as a source in the CF T . Performing\na near boundary analysis the needed divergences and counterterms can be identified, and\nW [gij ] can be constructed explicitely[13].\nThe AdS/CF T correspondence establishes also a relationship between the CF T Ward\nidentities and RG equations with the bulk equations. The radial (\"evolution\") equation is\nassociated to the CF T renormalization equation, while the constraints to Ward identities\n[14, 15, 16]. This relationship becomes particularly nice and clear in three-dimensional\nChern-Simons gravity. In fact, it has been known for a long time [17, 18, 19] that a\ntwo-dimensional flat SL(2, R) current encodes the Virasoro Ward identity, and this result\nfits quite naturally within AdS/CF T . In this paper we shall put these results in the\nAdS/CF T context. Just as a single SL(2, R) field contains the Virasoro Ward identity, the\nSL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) theory contains the conformal identity. However, the construction is\nslightly more complicated because the boundary conditions couple the left and right gauge\nfields. We shall see that the AdS/CF T prescription provides a natural reason to decouple\nboth sectors leading to the conformal identities. We shall also see that the AdS/CF T\nclassification of the gauge field components (leading, first subleading and subleading)\nprovides a natural, and free of ad-hoc assumptions, derivation of these identities from the\nbulk constraints.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After a brief introduction to the Virasoro Ward\nidentity and Polyakov's action, in Section 2 we analyze the bosonic conformal Ward\nidentity, derived from AdS3 /CF T2 . In section 3 we consider the Osp(2, 1) \u00d7 Osp(2, 1)\ntheory and find the superconformal Ward identities. Finally, we also consider the extended\nmodels in the chiral case.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nBosonic AdS3/CFT2\nThe Virasoro Ward identity\n\nLet us start by recalling that in bosonic case the generator of energy-momentum tensor\ncorrelators, W [g], is given by Polyakov's non-local action\nW [g] =\n\nc\n24\u03c0\n\nZZ\n\n2\n\nR\n\n1\nR\n\u22072\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere c is the central charge. The derivation of this functional from AdS/CF T was\nstudied in [20] (see also [21]). In Polyakov's light cone gauge\nds2 = dzdz\u0304 + h(z, z\u0304)dz\u0304 2 .\n\n(2)\n\nthe metric has only one independent function h(z, z\u0304) and one defines T = \u03b4W/\u03b4h. Then,\ndirectly from the trace anomaly and conservation of T ij it follows that T satisfies [18],\n \u0304 = \u2212 c \u2202 3 h + 2\u2202hT + h\u2202T\n\u2202T\n12\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is known as the Virasoro Ward identity.\nThis relation is contained in a flat SL(2, R) 2d gauge field as follows [17]. Consider in\ntwo dimensions the gauge field A = Az dz + Az\u0304 dz\u0304 with the following particular values\nAz =\n\n0 1\nT /k 0\n\n!\n\n,\n\nAz\u0304 =\n\n\u03b1 \u03bc\n\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\n \u0304 z+\nAll functions T, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bc are functions of z and z\u0304. The flatness condition Fz z\u0304 = \u2202Az\u0304 \u2212 \u2202A\n[Az , Az\u0304 ] = 0 implies\n1\n\u2202\u03bc\n2\n1\n1\n\u03bcT \u2212 \u2202 2 \u03bc\n\u03b2 =\nk\n2\n\n\u03b1 =\n\n \u0304 = \u03bc\u2202T + 2\u2202\u03bc T \u2212 k \u2202 3 \u03bc\n\u2202T\n2\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nWe recognize the third equation (7) as the Virasoro Ward identity with c = 6k.\nSince three-dimensional gravity can be formulated as the difference of SL(2, R) ChernSimons actions[22] it is hardly surprising that, within AdS/CF T , the Virasoro Ward\nidentities will arise through this mechanism. Actually, the relationship between SL(2, R)\nChern-Simons theory (from where the constraint Fz z\u0304 = 0 can be derived) and the 2dimensional action (1) was studied in detail in [19], almost ten years before the AdS/CF T\ncorrespondence became available. A similar idea was applied to W -gravity in [23]. Our\ngoal in this paper is to put some of the results of [19] in the AdS/CF T perspective,\nclarifying some issues, for example how to deal with the second SL(2, R) field, and to\nextend them to supergravity.\nWe shall see that the AdS/CF T correspondence provides a natural interpretation on\nwhy the above mechanism works. In particular we shall see that \u03bc enters as the source\nassociated to T , \u03b1 is a subleading term related locally to the source, and \u03b2, T are nonlocal, as in (7). We shall also extend this mechanism to the non-chiral case, which is not\ntrivial due to the boundary conditions on the metric.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nClassical three-dimensional equations and the Conformal\nWard identity\n\nWe start by writing the solution to the three-dimensional gravitational equations in the\nFefferham-Graham (FG) form. In this paragraph we follow closely [21].\nLet A and \u0100 be two SL(2, R) fields related to the triad and spin connection in the\nusual way\nA = w + e,\n\u0100 = w \u2212 e\n(8)\nThe solution to the equations of motion can be locally written as\nA = g \u22121 dg,\n\n\u0100 = h\u22121 dh\n\n(9)\n\nfor arbitrary group elements g and h. Since (9) is the most general local solution to the\nequations of motion we should be able to find the Fefferham-Graham (FG) [25] expansion\nfor the metric by manipulating (9). Incidentally, we recall that, in three dimensions, the\nFG expansion is finite and has only three-terms [20] (see [24] for a different formulation\nof this fact).\nThe FG expansion makes use of a choice of coordinates, namely, gri = 0. Our first task\nis then to write the solutions to the equations of motion (9) in a way consistent with the\nFG expansion, and coordinate choice. As shown in [21] the FG expansion is implemented\nin the Chern-Simons formulation by writting the fields in the form,\nA(x, r) = e\u2212rJ3 A(x) erJ3 + drJ3\n\u0100(x, r) = erJ3 \u0100(x) e\u2212rJ3 \u2212 drJ3 .\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere A(x) = Ai (x)dxi and \u0100(x) = \u0100i (x)dxi are both SL(2, R)\u2212valued connections\ndefined on the surface at fixed r. The radial dependence is then explicitly factor out as a\ngauge transformation. The fields A(x, r) and \u0100(x, r) will satisfy the equations of motion\nprovided A(x) and \u0100(x) are both flat.\nThe fields A(x) and \u0100(x) are in the SL(2, R) algebra and we can expand them in the\nbasis J+ , J\u2212 , J3 , namely,\nA(x) = A+ (x)J+ + A\u2212 (x)J\u2212 + A3 (x)J3\nand similarly for the other copy.\ne\u2212rJ3 J\u00b1 erJ3 = e\u2213r J\u00b1 , we obtain,\n\n(12)\n\nReplacing these expansions in (10,11), and using\n\nA(x, r) = (dr + A3 (x))J3 + e\u2212r A+ (x)J+ + er A\u2212 (x)J\u2212 ,\n\u0100(x, r) = (\u2212dr + \u01003 (x))J3 + er \u0100+ (x)J+ + e\u2212r \u0100\u2212 (x)J\u2212 .\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nWe now see that the different components of A(x) and \u0100(x) appears multiplied by\ndifferent powers of er . In the limit r \u2192 \u221e, this expansion assigns A\u2212 the role of leading\nterm (\"source\"), A3 the next to leading term, and A+ as the subleading term, which will\nbe non-local in the source. The expansion has only three terms as anticipated previously\n[20]. A similar analysis holds for \u0100.\n4\n\n\fLet us now compute the corresponding three-dimensional triad [21]\ne =\n\n1\n1\n1\ndr + (A3 \u2212 \u01003 ) J3 + er (A\u2212 J\u2212 \u2212 \u0100+ J+ ) + e\u2212r (A+ J+ \u2212 \u0100\u2212 J\u2212 ).\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(15)\n\nSince A(x) and \u0100(x) are forms on the 2-surface, this vielbein does not have the FG form.\nIn fact the metric g\u03bc\u03bd = ea\u03bc eb\u03bd \u03b7ab will have a piece of the form dr(A3i \u2212 \u01003i )dxi . In order\nto conform with the FG choice of coordinates we need to impose the extra boundary\ncondition [21]\nA3 (x) = \u01003 (x).\n(16)\nThis condition turns out to be the key input in order to find the Virasoro Ward identities,\nincluding the supersymmetric ones. In particular, we stress that it is not correct to\nimpose A3z = 0 and \u01003z\u0304 = 0 separately, as one would naively conclude from (4). Only their\ndifference has to be zero, and this condition follows in a natural way from the FG choice\nof coordinates.\nSummarizing, we have two SL(2, R) connections A and \u0100 defined on the surface at\nfixed r. They are completely arbitrary except for the condition (16). Now, the different\ncomponents of A and \u0100 play different roles within the AdS/CF T prescription. The\nleading components, A\u2212 and \u0100+ , are fixed and represents the sources for the corresponding\nCF T operator, analogous to g(0)ij in the metric FG expansion. The other components are\nexpressed in terms of the fixed components A\u2212 and \u0100+ via the equations of motion. Some\nof these relations are local, and others non-local. The 1-point functions will be related\nnon-locally to A\u2212 and \u0100+ .\nThe sources A\u2212 , \u0100+ are arbitrary and we can consider particular values for it, if we\nonly want to turn on some particular operators. For example, Polyakov's light cone gauge\n(2) leaves enough information to find one copy of the Virasoro algebra. We would like to\nconsider here a more general situation in which both copies of the Virasoro algebra arise\nsimultaneously. To this end, we choose complex coordinates z, z\u0304 and consider boundary\nmetrics having two Beltrami parameters,\nds2(0) = |dz\u0304 + \u03bc(z, z\u0304)dz|2 .\n\n(17)\n\nThe appropriated bulk gauge field that has as leading term the metric (17), and fulfills\n(16), is\nAz (z, z\u0304) =\nAz\u0304 (z, z\u0304) =\n\n\u03c9/2 T \u2032 /k\n1 \u2212\u03c9/2\n\n\u03c9\u0304/2\n\u03b3\n\u03bc \u2212\u03c9\u0304/2\n\n!\n!\n\nAz (z, z\u0304) =\nAz\u0304 (z, z\u0304) =\n\n\u03c9/2\n\u03bc\u0304\n\u03b3\u0304 \u2212\u03c9/2\n\n\u03c9\u0304/2\n1\n\u2032\nT\u0304 /k \u2212\u03c9\u0304/2\n\n!\n\n(18)\n\n!\n\n(19)\n\nHere all functions depend on z, z\u0304. \u03bc and \u03bc\u0304 are the sources; they enter as the leading\nterms when (18,19) are replaced in the expansion (10,11). All other components become\nfunctions of \u03bc and \u03bc\u0304 via the equations of motion.\n\n5\n\n\fThe bulk constraint equations F = \u2202Az \u2212 \u2202Az + [Az , Az ] = 0 (and similarly for F\u0304 = 0)\nimply the following relations, which can be understood as the non-chiral version of (7),\n\u03c9 = \u03c9\u0304 \u03bc\u0304 + \u2202 \u03bc\u0304\n\u03c9\u0304 = \u03c9\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc\n1\n(\u2202 \u03c9\u0304 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9) + \u03bcT \u2032 /k\n\u03b3 =\n2\n1\n(\u2202 \u03c9\u0304 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9) + \u03bc\u0304T\u0304 \u2032 /k\n\u03b3\u0304 =\n2\n\u2202T \u2032 /k = \u2202\u03b3 + \u03c9\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304T \u2032 /k\n\u2202 T\u0304 \u2032 /k = \u2202\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304\u03b4 + \u03c9 T\u0304 \u2032 /k\n\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n\nAs anticipated previously, \u03c9 and \u03c9\u0304 can be expressed locally in terms of the sources \u03bc\nand \u03bc\u0304 by solving (20,21). Incidentally, we mention that the 1-form w = \u03c9dz + \u03c9\u0304dz turns\nout to be the spin connection associated to the metric (17), equations (20-21) are the\ncorresponding torsion free conditions, and\nR = dw\n\n(26)\n\nbecomes the two-dimensional curvature.\nThe functions \u03b3 and \u03b3\u0304 can also be eliminated algebraically using (22,23), although\nthey depend on T \u2032 and T\u0304 \u2032 which are non-local in the sources.\nFinally, by analogy with (7), one would expect Equations (24,25) to give two copies\nof the Virasoro Ward identity. To see this, however, one needs to add the following local\npieces to T \u2032 and T\u0304 \u2032 [19],\nk 1\nT = T \u2032 + ( \u03c9 2 + \u2202\u03c9),\n2 2\nk 1 2\n\u2032\nT = T + ( \u03c9 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9).\n2 2\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nIt is direct to see that T and T\u0304 satisfy the correct Ward identities\nk\n\u2202T = \u2212 \u2202 3 \u03bc + 2(\u2202\u03bc)T + \u03bc\u2202T\n2\nk 3\n\u2202T = \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc + 2(\u2202\u03bc)T + \u03bc\u2202T\n2\n\n(29)\n(30)\n\nSummarizing, we have shown that the constraint equations of three-dimensional gravity contain the conformal Ward identity. It remains to prove that the combinations T\nand T\u0304 represent the 1-point functions in the presence of the sources \u03bc and \u03bc\u0304.\n\n2.3\n\nThe action and 1-point vacuum expectation values\n\nIn order to prove that T and T\u0304 are the correct 1-point functions we need to consider the\nrenormalised 3d action written as a function of the sources \u03bc and \u03bc\u0304, W [\u03bc, \u03bc\u0304], and check\n6\n\n\fthat\nT = \u22122\u03c0\n\n\u03b4W [\u03bc, \u03bc\u0304]\n,\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\nT\u0304 = \u22122\u03c0\n\n\u03b4W [\u03bc, \u03bc\u0304]\n.\n\u03b4 \u03bc\u0304\n\n(31)\n\nThree-dimensional gravity is given\nby the difference\nof two Chern-Simons actions I[A, \u0100] =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\nk R\nAdA + 3 AAA .

This is almost what we need.\nR is a local function of the sources that can be added (with the opposite sign) to I[A, \u0100],\nas dictated by the Dirichlet problem with \u03bc and \u03bc\u0304 fixed. However, recall that the true\n1-point functions satisfying the correct Ward identities are T, T\u0304 , defined in (27,28), and\nnot T \u2032 , T\u0304 \u2032 . However, it follows that the term which transform (T \u2032 , T\u0304 \u2032 ) into (T, T\u0304 ) in (33)\nis also a trivial local term. To see this consider the following identity\n0 = (\u03c9\u03b4\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b4\u03c9) \u2212 (\u03c9\u03b4\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b4\u03c9)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n1 2\n1 \u0010\n1 2\n\u03c9 + \u2202\u03c9 \u03b4\u03bc +\n=\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9 \u03b4\u03bc + \u03b4 \u2202\u03bc\u03c9 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc\u03c9\n2\n2\n2\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nTo go from (34) to (35) we have used (21) and (20) in the first and second terms in (34),\nrespectively. We then observe that the first two terms in (35) are exactly the local pieces\nadded to \u0010(T \u2032 , T\u0304 \u2032 ) in \u0011(27,28),\u0010 multiplied\u0011 by the variations of the sources.

We have\nconcentrated in the AdS3 /CF T2 case and have made use of the Chern-Simons formulation\nfor the 3-dimensional bulk supergravity theory. The bulk constraints are then represented\nby the rather simple equation Fz z\u0304 = 0 where F is the associated Yang-Mills curvature.\nThe Ward identities are shown to be encoded in this equation, provided the boundary\nconditions for the gauge field (AdS asymptotics in the Feffermam-Graham sense) are\nproperly incorporated.\n9\n\n\fWe have only considered the saddle point evaluation for the bulk partition function.\nIt would be interesting to go further and compute the full path integral, including also\nother insertions. Since Chern-Simons theory has no local degrees of freedom this seems\nfeasible. On the other hand, the local group is non-compact, Osp(2, 1) \u00d7 Osp(2, 1), and\nhence the calculation will be challenging.\nFinally, it would also be interesting to study the generalization of this approach to the\nAdS5 /CF T4 correspondence when the bulk action is taken to be 5-dimensional ChernSimons supergravity [26]. The holographic energy-momentum tensor for this theory has\nrecently been computed in [27], following the cohomological methods introduced in [28].\nThe associated Ward identities would probe other aspects of the corresponding dual CFT.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Marc Henneaux, Kostas Skenderis, Adam Schwimmer and Stefan\nTheisen for useful discussions on AdS/CF T .

We will use the following representation for the generators:\nJ+\n\nR+\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 1 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 1\n1 \uf8ec\n= \u221a \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n2 0 1 0\n\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nJ\u2212 = \uf8ed 1 0 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0\n\uf8eb\n\nThe generators satisfy the following:\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0 0\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nJ3 = \uf8ed 0 \u22121 0 \uf8f8\n2\n0 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 0\n1 \uf8ec\nR\u2212 = \u221a \uf8ed 0 0 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n2 \u22121 0 0\n\nST r(J+ J\u2212 ) = 1\n\nST r(J3J3 ) =\n\n1\n2\n\nST r(R\u00b1 R\u2213 ) = \u00b11\n\n(54)\n\n(55)\n\n(56)\n(57)\n\nThe Osp(1|2) group can the generalized to the N -extended super-symmetric case, to\nget the Osp(N|2, R) group, whose super-Lie algebra is the following:\n\u2022 The three bosonic generators satisfy (which is just the SL(2, R) Lie algebra):\n[J3 , J\u00b1 ] = \u00b1J\u00b1\n\n[J+ , J\u2212 ] = 2J3\n\n(58)\n\n\u2022 The internal symmetry group generators (which is the SO(N) algebra) satisfy:\n[Ba , Bb ] = fabc B c\n10\n\n(59)\n\n\fwhere a, b, c = 0 . . .
