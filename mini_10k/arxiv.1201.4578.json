We consider the three-dimensional (3D) mean-field model for the BoseEinstein condensate (BEC), with a 1D nonlinear lattice (NL), which periodically\nchanges the sign of the nonlinearity along the axial direction, and the harmonicoscillator trapping potential applied in the transverse plane. The lattice can be created\nas an optical or magnetic one, by means of available experimental techniques. The\nobjective is to identify stable 3D solitons supported by the setting. Two methods\nare developed for this purpose: The variational approximation, formulated in the\nframework of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the 1D nonpolynomial Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (NPSE) in the axial direction, which allows one to predict the collapse in the\nframework of the 1D description. Results are summarized in the form of a stability\nregion for the solitons in the plane of the NL strength and wavenumber. Both methods\nproduce a similar form of the stability region. Unlike their counterparts supported by\nthe NL in the 1D model with the cubic nonlinearity, kicked solitons of the NPSE\ncannot be set in motion, but the kick may help to stabilize them against the collapse,\nby causing the solitons to shed excess norm. A dynamical effect specific to the NL\nis found in the form of freely propagating small-amplitude wave packets emitted by\nperturbed solitons.\n\n\fBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction and the model\nThe use of periodic potentials, induced by optical lattices, for steering matter waves in\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is a vast research area, as demonstrated in reviews [1][4]. An important aspect of this topic is that the lattice potentials, balancing the cubic\nnonlinearities induced by inter-atomic collisions in the BEC, help to create and stabilize\nsolitons. In particular, the lattices play a critical role in stabilizing two-dimensional\n(2D) solitons against the collapse in the condensate with intrinsic self-attraction [5].\nTheoretical and experimental studies of the soliton dynamics in periodic potentials\nwere recently extended for nonlinear lattices (NLs), which may be induced by a\nspatially periodic modulation of the local strength of the nonlinearity (the respective\neffective nonlinear potentials are often called pseudopotentials [6]). In BEC, the spatial\nmodulation can be implemented by means of the Feshbach resonance controlled by\nproperly patterned external fields (in the quasi-1D BEC, a combination of linear and\nnonlinear lattices may also be induced by periodically modulating the strength of\nthe tight transverse confinement in the axial direction [7]). As well as their linear\ncounterparts, NLs have drawn much attention in connection to their potential for the\ncreation and control of matter-wave solitons in a number of different settings, see original\nworks [8]-[18] and review [4]. While NLs readily support stable 1D solitons [8]-[17], it\nhas been found difficult, albeit sometimes possible, to stabilize 2D solitons against the\ncollapse by means of the NL-induced pseudopotentials [18]. As concerns the 1D solitons\nin models with the cubic nonlinearity, the numerical analysis also reveals that they\nfeature mobility in the presence of NLs [8, 9].\nThus far, no example of stabilization of 3D solitons by NLs has been reported.\nOn the other hand, the creation of multidimensional solitons can be facilitated by\ncombinations of linear and nonlinear lattices, as shown, in particular, in Ref. [11],\nwhere 2D solitons supported by crossed 1D lattices, one linear and one nonlinear, were\nreported. Still earlier, it was demonstrated that the 1D linear-lattice potential, acting\ntogether with periodic temporal modulations of the nonlinearity, which may be induced\nby the Feshbach resonance controlled by a time-periodic external field, can stabilize 3D\nsolitons [19].\nA natural possibility for the creation of 3D solitons is suggested by a combination\nof the 1D NL with the usual harmonic-oscillator linear trapping potential acting in\nthe plane perpendicular to the NL axis (similar settings, but with linear 1D lattices,\nwere shown to be efficient in the creation of 3D gap solitons in the BEC with the\nrepulsive intrinsic nonlinearity [20]). This setting is the subject of the present paper.\nWe tackle it by means of two different methods, namely, the variational approximation\n(VA) applied to the underlying 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and, in a more accurate\nform, the effective 1D nonpolynomial Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NPSE), which was efficient\nin description of many other settings dominated by the interplay of the tight 2D\nconfinement and nonlinearity [21], [22], [7], including the action of linear lattice\npotentials in the axial direction [23].\n\n\fBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n\n3\n\nThus, we consider a dilute BEC of bosons with mass m confined in the transverse\nplane by the isotropic harmonic-oscillator potential with frequency \u03c9\u22a5 , V (x, y) =\n2\n(1/2)m\u03c9\u22a5\n(x2 + y 2). The corresponding 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation is rescaled by\n\u22121\nmeasuring\np time and coordinates in units of \u03c9\u22a5 and the transverse-confinement radius,\na\u22a5 = ~/(m\u03c9\u22a5 ), respectively (hence the energy is measured in units of ~\u03c9\u22a5 ):\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n\u2202\u03c8\n1 2 1 2\n2\n2\n(1)\ni\nx + y + 2\u03c0g(z)|\u03c8| \u03c8,\n= \u2212 \u2207 +\n\u2202t\n2\n2\nwith the condensate's wave function normalized to unity,\nZ\n|\u03c8(r, t)|2d3 r = 1.\n\n(2)\n\nThe interaction strength in Eq. (1) is\n\ng(z) = 2(N \u2212 1)as (z)/a\u22a5 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere N is the number of atoms and as the z-dependent s-wave scattering length of the\ninter-atomic potential, the NL corresponding to the periodic dependence,\ng(z) = g0 + g1 cos (2kz).\n\n(4)\n\nBelow, we consider the most fundamental case of g0 = 0. Placing the center of the\nsoliton at z = 0, we assume g1 < 0, to support the soliton by the locally attractive\nnonlinearity.\nThe 1D periodic modulation of the local scattering length, implied by Eqs. (4) and\n(3), can be implemented in an optical lattice, produced by the interference of a pair of\ncounterpropagating laser beams controlling as via the Feshbach resonance [24]. In that\ncase, the period of the resulting NL is limited by diffraction to & 1 \u03bcm. More often, the\nFeshbach resonance in experiments with BEC is controlled by the magnetic field [25].\nIn that case, the 1D periodic structure can be built as a magnetic lattice, imposed by a\nproperly designed set of ferromagnet films [26], with the respective fabrication limit on\nthe NL period also amounting to & 1 \u03bcm. Then, assuming that the trapping potential\nconfines the transverse size of the condensate, as usual, to the same order of magnitude\n(a few microns), one may conclude that the solitons are built of several thousand atoms\n[27].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The direct VA is developed in Section\nII, and the effective 1D NPSE is derived in Section III. In both cases, we find the\nstability region for solitons in the plane of (k, |g1 |). The mobility of the solitons is\ntested in Section III by means of direct simulations of the evolution of axially kicked\nsolitons, in the framework of the NPSE (it is concluded that the solitons are not mobile\nin the present setting; however, the kick may effectively stabilize solitons against the\ncollapse). The paper is concluded by Section IV.\n\n\f4\n\nBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n2. The variational approximation\n\nOur first aim is to apply the VA to Eq.

(4)], along with\nthe widths obtained by solving numerically the 1D NPSE (see below). The comparison\ndemonstrates close proximity of the predictions of the VA to the results produced by the\nNPSE. In the right panels of Fig. 1, we plot eigenfrequencies \u03a91 and \u03a92 of excitations\naround the bright soliton, as found from Eq. (18).\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the stability diagram in the plane of (k, |g1|) for the bright\nsolitons trapped in the NL with wavenumber k and strength |g1 | (again, with g0 = 0).\nThe stability region, defined as that where solutions of Eqs. (14) and (15) yield energy\nminima, is bounded by the dashed lines (strictly speaking, the bright solitons are only\nmetastable, because for g0 = 0 and g1 < 0 the true ground state is the collapsed one,\nwith potential energy U = \u2212\u221e). Below the lower dashed line, the soliton is subject\nto spreading along longitudinal axis z (which may be considered as a manifestation of\nthe delocalization transition, which was earlier studied in linear lattices [30]). Above\nthe upper dashed line, the soliton is destroyed by the collapse. Very close to the upper\ndashed line, the VA predicts a bistability, i.e., coexistence of two stable solitons at the\nsame values of k and |g1 | (in Fig. 1, only the solitons with the lowest energy are shown\nin the case of the bistability). In Fig. 2 we also plot the respective stability region\n(between the solid lines) as obtained from the numerical solution of the NPSE (see\n\n\f6\n\nBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n3\n2\n\nk=0.2\n\n1\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\nfrequencies\n\nwidths\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\nk=0.5\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\nk=0.8\n1\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n|g1|\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n|g1|\n\nFigure 1.

The dot-dashed line is the lower bound predicted\nby the one-dimensional cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\n\nbelow). The shrinkage and disappearance of the stability region at large values of k is\nquite natural, as in that case the rapidly oscillating nonlinearity in Eq.

Accordingly, the\nabove argument concerning the disappearance of the stability region at large k does\nnot apply to the cubic equation, because, in the limit of the small NL period, \u03c0/k,\nthe soliton may compress itself into a single potential well, and this trend will not be\naborted by the onset of the collapse.\n3. The nonpolynomial Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NPSE)\n3.1. The derivation and imaginary-time evolution\nA more accurate description of the solitons is provided by the NPSE, which can be\nderived by means of the semi-variational approach from the full 3D equation (1), using\nthe method developed in Ref. [21]. To this end, we adopt the following ansatz, which,\nunlike the above one (6), contains arbitrary functions of the longitudinal coordinate,\n\u03c3(z, t) and f (z, t), accounting for the transverse width and axial wave function of the\ncondensate:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nx2 + y 2\n1\nf (z, t).\n(19)\nexp \u2212\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u221a\n\u03c0\u03c3(z, t)\n2 (\u03c3(z, t))2\nNote that, as follows from Eqs.

(23) into Eq. (22), we obtain a closed-form equation for the axial\nwave function, which is tantamount to the NPSE derived in Ref.

On the other hand, in the strong-coupling regime,\ng(z)|f (z, t)|2 \u226b 1 (which is relevant only for the repulsive sign of the nonlinearity,\ng > 0), the NPSE amounts to the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the quadratic\nnonlinearity (see, e.g., Ref.

(4), with g0 = 0 and g1 < 0, as said above. Results were obtained\nfrom numerical solutions based the finite-difference Crank-Nicolson predictor-corrector\nalgorithm [33].\nFirst, by simulating the NPSE in imaginary time, we study the formation of bright\nsolitons. In particular, at g1 = \u22120.4, the soliton does not self-trap, slowly degenerating\ntowards a uniform configuration along axial direction z. Instead, at g1 = \u22121 the bright\nsoliton self-traps quickly, representing the ground state of Eq. (24). In Fig. 3 we\nplot typical examples of the axial density, \u03c1(z), of the so obtained stable bright soliton\ntrapped in the NL, comparing the NPSE results to those predicted by Gaussian ansatz\n(6) (the stability of the solitons was verified by real-time simulations, see below). The\nfigure shows that the stable solitons are localized around one potential minimum of the\nNL (at x = 0). The NPSE profiles are quite close to their variational counterparts, see\nalso the left panels in Fig. 1. The main quantitative, although not very large, difference\nbetween the VA and NPSE is the prediction of the critical strength for the onset of the\ncollapse, as seen in Fig. 2.\n4. Real-time dynamics\n4.1. Stability of the solitons\nThe next step is the study of the real-time dynamics of the quasi-1D BEC trapped in the\nNL. First of all, simulating NPSE (24) in real time, we have found that all the existing\nsolitons are stable, with initially perturbed wave functions featuring small oscillations\naround the solitonic configurations. As shown in Fig. 4, an interesting dynamical feature\nis observed if the initial wave function is the Gaussian with a width close to that of the\nsoliton: expulsion of two small waves from the Gaussian peak (which is represented by\nthe column centered at z = 0 in Fig. 4). The emitted waves rapidly move in opposite\ndirections, while the remaining central peak relaxes into a stationary soliton. This effect\nis interesting because the same is not observed in linear lattices, which would readily\n\n\f9\n\n\u03c1(z)\n\nBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-8\n\n|g1| = 0.8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n|g1| = 1\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n|g1| = 1.2\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nz\n\n4\n\n8\n\nFigure 3.

To present a typical result, we fix g0 = 0, g1 = \u22121.2,\nand k = 0.5, and perform real-time simulations at increasing values of v. As shown in\nFig. 5, at v = 0.4 we observe ejection of small-amplitude waves from the soliton (cf.\nFig. 4), while the central peak remains trapped at the initial position, relaxing back\ninto a stationary soliton, with a somewhat smaller value of the norm.\nWith the increase of v, the amplitude and the velocity of the ejected waves increases,\nbut the remaining soliton stays put. This is a noteworthy difference from the soliton\ndynamics in 1D NLs with the cubic nonlinearity, where the soliton may be set in motion\nby the kick [8]. Eventually, if the kick is too strong, it destroys the soliton. In particular,\nfor |g1 | = 1.2 the destruction is observed at v \u2265 0.48, see an example in Fig. 6 for v = 0.6.\nThe critical velocity, vc , at which the kicked soliton is destroyed, is shown in Fig. 7\nas a function of the NL strength, |g1|. The figure features a linear growth of vc with NL\nstrength |g1 |, at sufficiently large values of |g1 |. This fact can be explained by estimating\nthe critical velocity as that at which the respective kinetic energy of the kicked soliton,\n(1/2)Msol v 2 , is equal to height VPN of the effective Peierls-Nabarro potential induced\nby the nonlinear (pseudo) potential. The mass of the soliton, Msol , is proportional\nto its norm, which is 1, according to Eq. (20). Further, the potential-energy density\ncorresponding to Eq. (24) actually coincides with the potential part of Lagrangian\ndensity (21), that should be evaluated with the help of expression (23) for \u03c3. Then,\na straightforward consideration of Eqs. (21), (23) and (24) yields the following scaling\nrelations in the limit of large |g1|: |f (0)|2 \u223c \u03c3 \u22121 \u223c W \u22121 \u223c |g1 |\u22121 , where W is the\naxial size of the soliton, and, eventually, VPN \u223c |g1 |2 . Thus, the threshold condition,\n(1/2)Msol v 2 = VPN , explains the linear proportionality between vc and |g1 |, which is\n\n\f11\n\n\u03c1(z)\n\nBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n-60\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n-60\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n-60\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n-60\n\nt=0\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nt=25\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nt=50\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nt=75\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\nz\n\n40\n\n60\n\nFigure 6.

The vanishing of vc at |g1 | \u2248 0.75 in Fig. 7 is a\nconsequence of the fact that the soliton with this value of |g1 | lies at the edge of the\ntriangular area in Fig. 2, i.e., it does not exist as a stable mode even without being\nkicked.\nThe fact that the kick induces emission of radiation from the soliton may be used\nto stabilize them in the collapse domain of Fig. 2. To this end, we take, for example,\nthe Gaussian wave packet with g1 = \u22121.5 and k = 0.5, which falls into the region of the\ncollapse. Real-time simulations of Eq. (24) demonstrate that, if the Gaussian is kicked\nhard enough, it does not blow up, but rather forms a stable soliton, in a combination\nwith the emission of radiation waves. This is shown in Fig. 8 for initial velocity v = 0.4.\nThe initial configuration evades the blowup because the emission of radiation reduces\nthe norm of the remaining soliton, pushing it beneath the collapse threshold, see the\nlower panel in Fig. 8.

Conclusions\nWe have reported results for 3D matter-wave solitons supported by a combination\nof the axial 1D NL (nonlinear lattice), which periodically reverses the sign of the\nnonlinear interaction, and the tightly trapping harmonic-oscillator potential acting in\nthe transverse plane. The results were obtained by means of two distinct approaches:\nThe VA (variational approximation), which was applied directly to the 3D GrossPitaevskii equation, and the 1D NPSE, that was derived from the underlying 3D\nequation. Previous works did not study the stabilization of 3D solitons by NLs. The\nmain result, produced by means of both methods in similar forms, is the stability domain\nfor solitons in the plane of the NL strength and wavenumber. The usual 1D cubic GrossPitaevskii equation with the NL cannot produce adequate results, as it does not give\nrise to the collapse, which is the most important stability-limiting factor.\nAnother essential difference of the solitons produced by the NPSE with the NL\nfrom their counterparts in the case of the cubic NL is that the solitons are immobile\nin the framework of the NPSE: The kick applied to the soliton either leaves it pinned,\nor, eventually, destroys it. The critical size of the kick which destroys the soliton was\nfound to be proportional to the strength of the NL, provided that the strength is large\n\n\fBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices\n\n13\n\nenough; an explanation for this dependence was proposed. On the other hand, the kick,\nif applied to the wave packet created above the collapse threshold, may help it to shed\noff the excess norm and thus stabilize itself against the collapse. A related dynamical\neffect, which demonstrates the difference of the NLs from linear lattices, is that wave\npackets relaxing into solitons can emit small-amplitude waves, which freely propagate\nin the system.\nA challenging extension of the analysis may be to develop it for the setting with a\n2D NL and the 1D trapping potential acting in the transverse direction. The 2D version\nof the NPSE was developed previously, but in the absence of the NL [21, 34]. In this\ncase, one may expect the existence of both fundamental and vortical 2D solitons.\nReferences\n[1] V. A. Brazhnyi, and V. V. Konotop, Mod. Phys. Lett. B 18, 627 (2004); O.
