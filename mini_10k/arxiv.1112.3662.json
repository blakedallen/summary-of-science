Due to the presence of environmental interactions, decoherence is the foremost challenge in any\nconventional quantum computation schemes since quantum error correction protocols typically have very severe\nconstraints on the amount of error that can be corrected\nin a fault-tolerant manner. Topological quantum computation (TQC) utilizes topological degeneracy of certain\nlow-dimensional systems believed to host non-Abelian\nquasiparticles (anyons): fractional quantum Hall states\n(e.g. at filling factor \u03bd = 5/2)4\u20136 , certain exotic lattice\nspin systems1 , and topological superconductors7\u20139 . The\nlatter has received tremendous attention recently10\u201313\nand a number of possible candidates for topological\nsuperconductivity has been proposed including strontium ruthenate14 , topological insulator-superconductor\nheterostructure15,16 , semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure17\u201321 and non-centrosymmetric superconductors22 . In all these systems, non-Abelian Ising anyons are\nrealized as Majorana zero-energy modes bound to certain\ntopological defects and obey non-Abelian braiding statistics4,5,9,23,24 . Given that Majorana zero-energy quasiparticles are described by hermitian operators \u03b3 = \u03b3 \u2020 ,\none can show by constructing a non-local Dirac operator \u0109 out of two spatially-separated Majorana operators\n\u03b3\u0302i=1,2 (i.e. \u0109 = \u03b3\u03021 + i\u03b3\u03022 ) that there are 2n\u22121 degenerate\nstates for a given overall fermion parity with 2n Majorana zero-energy modes at fixed positions. The information is encoded in the occupied or unoccupied states\nof the non-local Dirac fermion modes. This is a crucial\nconcept for the Majorana-based TQC proposals. As long\n\nas global fermion parity in the system is preserved, one\ncan design fault-tolerant quantum computation schemes\nat sufficiently low temperatures.\nIn this paper we investigate the effect of finitetemperature thermal fluctuations on three key aspects of\ntopological quantum computation: quantum coherence\nof the topological qubits, topologically-protected quantum gates and the read-out of qubits. Since the information is encoded in non-local degrees of freedom of the\nground state many-body wavefunction, it is important\nto keep the system close to the ground state. However, any systems realized in the laboratory are operated\nat a finite temperature T > 0. To prevent uncontrollable thermal excitations, it is generally accepted that T\nhas to be way below the bulk excitation gap. However,\ncomplications appear when there exist various types of\nsingle-particle excitations with different magnitudes of\ngaps which can change the occupation of the non-local\nfermionic modes. Note that throughout the paper we\nassume that Majorana fermions are sufficiently far away\nfrom each other and neglect exponentially small energy\nsplitting due to inter-vortex tunneling. The effect of\nthese processes on topological quantum computing has\nbeen discussed elsewhere25,26 . Another trivial effect not\nconsidered in this work is a situation where the fermion\nparity conservation is explicitly broken by the Majorana\nmode being in direct contact with a bath of fermions\n(electrons and holes) where obviously the Majorana will\ndecay into the fermion bath, and consequently decohere.\nSuch situations arise, for example, in current topological\ninsulators where the existence of the bulk carriers (invariably present due to the unintentional bulk doping) would\nmake any surface non-Abelian Majorana mode disappear\nrather rapidly. Another situation that has recently been\nconsidered in this context27 is the end Majorana mode\n\n\f2\nin a one-dimensional nanowire being in contact with the\nelectrons in the non-superconducting part of the semiconductor, leading to a zero-energy Majorana resonance\nrather than a non-Abelian Majorana bound state at zero\nenergy. The fact that the direct coupling of Majorana\nmodes to an ordinary fermionic bath will lead to its decoherence is rather obvious and well-known, and does not\nrequire a general discussion since such situations must be\ndiscussed on a case by case basis taking into account the\ndetails of the experimental systems. In particular, the\nreason the quantum braiding operations in Majoranabased systems involves interferometry is to preserve the\nfermion parity conservation. Our theory in the current\nwork considers the general question of how thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures affect the non-Abelian\nand the non-local nature of the Majorana mode.\nWe consider a simple model for two-dimensional chiral px + ipy superconductor where Majorana zero-energy\nstates are hosted by Abrikosov vortices. The quasiparticle excitations in this system are divided into two categories: a) Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) or socalled midgap states localized in the vortex core with energies below the bulk superconducting gap28,29 (the gap\nthat separates the zero-energy state to the lowest CdGM\nstate is called the mini-gap \u2206M ); b) extended states with\nenergies above the bulk quasiparticle gap which is denoted by \u2206. The natural question arising in this context is how these two types of excitations affect topological quantum computation using the Majorana zeroenergy states at finite temperature. This question is\nvery relevant in the context of strontium ruthenate as\nwell as other weak-coupling BCS superconductors where\nthe Fermi energy EF is much larger than the superconducting gap \u2206 in which case \u2206M \u221d \u22062 /EF \u001c \u2206. We\nmention in passing here that the semiconductor-based\nMajorana proposals17\u201320 do not have low-lying CdGM\nstates because the minigap \u2206M \u223c \u220630 due to the small\nFermi energy in the semiconductor. If the temperature\nis substantially below the minigap, i.e. T \u001c \u2206M , obviously all excited states can be safely ignored. However,\nsuch low temperatures with T \u001c \u2206M can be hard to\nachieve in the laboratory since for typical superconductors \u2206/EF \u223c 10\u22123 \u221210\u22124 . We note that even in the semiconductor sandwich structures the Majorana energetics\nobey the inequality \u2206M < \u2206 since in general EF > \u2206\neven in the semiconductor-based systems in view of the\nfact that typically \u2206 \u223c 1 K. This makes our consideration in this paper of relevance also to the semiconductorbased topological quantum computing platforms. In this\npaper we investigate the non-trivial intermediate temperature regime \u2206M \u001c T < \u2206. To make this paper more\npedagogical, we will use a simple physical model that\ncaptures the relevant physics. We find that the presence\nof the excited midgap states localized in the vortex core\ndoes not effect braiding operations. However, the midgap\nstates do affect the outcome of the interferometry experiments.\nWe also study the quantum dynamical evolution and\n\nobtain equations of motion for the reduced density matrix assuming that the finite temperature is set by a\nbosonic bath (e.g. phonons). We find that the qubit\ndecay rate \u03bb is given by the rate of changing fermion\nparity in the system and is exponentially suppressed (i.e.\n\u03bb \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206/T )) at low temperatures in a fully-gapped\npx + ipy superconductor. In this context, we make some\ncomments about Refs.[31] claiming to obtain different results regarding the effect of thermal fluctuations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we generalize the notion of non-Abelian braiding to a finite temperature and show that braiding is not affected by CdGM\nbound states. In Sec. III we show that the midgap states\nare important for interferometry experiments and generally reduce the visibility of the signal. In Sec. IV we study\nthe problem of qubit decoherence and effects of thermal\nfluctuations. Finally, we conclude in Sec.V. Some technical details are given in the Appendices.\n\nII.\n\nNON-ABELIAN BRAIDING IN THE\nPRESENCE OF MIDGAP STATES\n\nIn this section we address the question of how the\nmidgap states affect the non-Abelian statistics at finite\ntemperature. The usual formulation of the non-Abelian\nstatistics as unitary transformation of the ground states\ndoes not apply, since at finite temperature the system has\nto be described as a mixed state. We need to generalize\nthe notion of the non-Abelian braiding in terms of physical observables32 . This can be done as the following:\nconsider a topological qubit made up by four vortices labeled by a = 1, 2, 3, 4. Each of them carries a Majorana\nzero-energy state, whose corresponding quasiparticle is\n\u2020\n2\ndenoted by \u03b3\u0302a0 which satisfies \u03b3\u0302a0\n= 1, \u03b3\u0302a0 = \u03b3\u0302a0\n. There\nare other midgap states in the vortex core which are denoted by d\u02c6ai , i = 1, 2, . . . , m. (Actually the number of\nmidgap states is huge and the midgap spectrum eventually merges with the bulk excitation spectrum. However,\nsince we are interested in T \u001c \u2206, we can choose an energy cutoff \u039b such that T \u001c \u039b \u001c \u2206 and only include\nthose midgap states that are below \u039b.) It is convenient\nto write d\u02c6ai = \u03b3\u0302a,2i\u22121 + i\u03b3\u0302a,2i , so each vortex core carries\nodd number of Majorana fermions \u03b3\u0302ai , i = 0, 1, . . . , 2m.\nHaving the notations set up, we now\ndefine a genQ2m\neralized Majorana operator \u0393\u0302a = im i=0 \u03b3\u0302ai . It is\nstraightforward to check that {\u0393\u0302a , \u0393\u0302b } = 2\u03b4ab . We then\ndefine the fermion parity shared by a pair of vortices\n\u03a3\u0302ab = i\u0393\u0302a \u0393\u0302b . The topological qubit can be uniquely\nspecified by a set of measurements of the expectation\nvalue of the following Pauli matrices \u03c3\u0302 = (\u03c3\u0302x , \u03c3\u0302y , \u03c3\u0302z ):\n\u03c3\u0302x = \u03a3\u030232 , \u03c3\u0302y = \u03a3\u030213 , \u03c3\u0302z = \u03a3\u030221 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe non-Abelian braiding can be represented as the\ntransformation of h\u03c3\u0302i.\nNow we list the key assumptions to establish the nonAbelian properties of the vortices:\n\n\f3\n1. The fermion parity \u03a3\u0302ab is a physical observable that\ncan be measured by suitable interferometry experiments, even at finite temperature.\n2. All the bound states remain localized together with\nthe zero-energy state when the vortices are transported. Therefore they can be considered as one\ncomposite system.\n3. The tunneling processes of fermions between different vortices and transitions to the gapped continuum are exponentially suppressed due to the presence of the bulk superconducting gap.\nUnder these conditions, the only local dynamical processes are the transitions of fermions between the localized bound states, e.g. scattering by collective excitations like phonons. However, such processes necessarily\nconserve \u0393\u0302a , therefore also the parities \u03a3\u0302ab .\nTo see this explicitly, the state of the qubit is described\nby the density matrix \u03c1\u0302(t). Because we are truncating the\nwhole Hilbert space to include only those below our cutoff \u039b, it is necessary to use the time-dependent instantaneous basis33 . We can generally consider transitions\nbetween the various states induced by four-fermion interactions or coupling to a bosonic bath. To be specific,\nwe write down the Hamiltonian of the system:\n\u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124int .\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u01240 is the Hamiltonian of the BCS superconductor\nwith vortices, whose positions Ri are time-dependent.\nAt each moment of time \u01240 can be diagonalized, yielding a set of complete eigenbasis which are represented by\nthe time-dependent generalization of the aforementioned\nBogoliubov quasiparticles \u03b3\u0302a0 (t), d\u02c6ai (t). \u0124int describes\nall kinds of perturbations that are allowed under the assumptions.\nWithout going into the details of microscopic calculations, we write down the general Lindblad form of the\nmaster equation34 governing the time-evolution of the\ndensity matrix:\nd\u03c1\u0302\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\n1\n=\n\u2212 i[\u0124t (t), \u03c1\u0302] + \u015c \u03c1\u0302\u015c \u2020 \u2212 {\u015c \u2020 \u015c, \u03c1\u0302}.\ndt\n\u2202t\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe \u2202\u2202t\u03c1\u0302 denotes the change of \u03c1\u0302 solely due to the change\nof basis states. Here \u0124t describes the (effective) unitary evolution of the density matrix due to transitions\nbetween different fermionic states and the Lindblad superoperators \u015c corresponds to non-unitary evolution induced by system-environment coupling. Our assumption\non the locality of the interactions in the system implies\nthat\n[\u0124t , \u03a3\u0302ab ] = 0, [\u015c, \u03a3\u0302ab ] = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation values of \u03c3(t) is\ngiven by\ndh\u03c3i\nd\n\u2202\u03c3\nd\u03c1\u0302\n= Tr \u03c3 \u03c1\u0302 = Tr\n\u03c1\u0302(t) + Tr \u03c3 .\ndt\ndt\n\u2202t\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nWith (4), it is straightforward to check that\n\u0001\n1\nTr \u03c3[\u0124, \u03c1\u0302] = 0, Tr \u03c3 \u015c \u03c1\u0302\u015c \u2020 \u2212 {\u015c \u2020 \u015c, \u03c1\u0302} = 0.\n2\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore we have\ndh\u03c3(t)i\n\u2202\u03c3(t)\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302(t)\n= Tr\n\u03c1\u0302(t) + Tr \u03c3(t)\n= \u2202t Tr [\u03c3(t)\u03c1\u0302(t)].\ndt\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n(7)\nAs we have defined, \u2202t means that all changes come from\nthe change in the basis {\u03b3\u0302ai (t)}. Since after the braiding\nthe system returns to its initial configuration, the operators \u03b3\u0302ia undergo unitary transformations. So if the\nbraiding starts at t = ti and ends at t = tf , we have the\nsimple result h\u03c3(ti )i = h\u03c3(tf )i. However, the operators\n\u0393\u0302(tf ) are different from \u0393\u0302(ti ). One can easily verify that\nthe operators \u0393\u0302a satisfy Ivanov's rule9,32 under braiding\nof vortices a and b:\n\u0393\u0302a \u2192 \u0393\u0302b , \u0393\u0302b \u2192 \u2212\u0393\u0302a .\n\n(8)\n\nAnd the transformation of h\u03c3\u0302i is identical to the case\nwithout any midgap states. In conclusion, in terms of\nphysically measurable quantities, the non-Abelian statistics is well-defined in the presence of excited midgap\nstates localized in the vortex core.\nThis result is thoroughly non-obvious because it may\nappear on first sight that arbitrary thermal occupancies\nof the mid-gap excited states would completely suppress\nthe non-Abelian nature of the system since the Majorana mode resides entirely at zero energy and not in the\nexcited mid-gap states.\nIII.\n\nINTERFEROMETRY IN THE PRESENCE\nOF MIDGAP STATES\n\nWe now discuss the effect of the midgap states in interferometry experiments designed for the qubit readout35\u201338 There is a number of recent proposals for interferometry experiments in topological superconductors39\u201341 . In this paper, we use an example of the MachZehnder interferometer proposed by Grosfeld and Stern42\nbased on Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect. In this proposal,\na Josephson vortex (fluxon) is driven by supercurrent\nto circumvent a superconducting island. The fluxon appearing at the interface between two topological px + ipy\nsuperconductors carries a zero-energy Majorana modes,\nand behaves as a non-Abelian anyon. Therefore, the vortex current around the central superconductor is sensitive\nto the topological content of the enclosed superfluid. (We\nrefer the reader to Ref. [42] for more details.) Indeed,\nthe vortex current is proportional to the total tunneling\namplitude:\nJv \u221d |(tL \u00dbL + tL \u00dbR )|\u03a80 i|2\n= |tL |2 + |tR |2 + 2Re{t\u2217L tR h\u03a80 |\u00dbL\u22121 \u00dbR |\u03a80 i}\n2\n\n2\n\n= |tL | + |tR | +\n\n2Re{t\u2217L tR ei\u03c6AC h\u03a80 |M\u0302 |\u03a80 i}.\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\nTo understand quantitatively how the visibility of the\ninterference pattern is affected by the midgap state, let us\nconsider the following model of the fluxon. Since we are\ninterested in the effect of midgap states, we assume there\nis only one midgap state and model the probe vortex by\na two-level system, or spin 1/2, with the Hilbert space\n{|0i, |1i}. Here |1i denotes the state with the midgap\nstate occupied. We also assume that the charge enclosed\nby the interference trajectory Q = 0 so we can neglect\nthe AC phase. The Hamiltonian is then given by\nFIG. 1: Mach-Zehnder interferometer proposed in Ref. [42]\nfor topological qubit detection. Due to the Aharonov-Casher\neffect, the vortex current is sensitive to the charge enclosed.\nLong Josephson junction between two topological superconductors carries allows for Josephson vortices (fluxons) that\ncarry Majorana zero-energy modes.\n\nHere |\u03a80 i is the initial state of the system and \u00dbL and\n\u00dbR are the unitary evolution operators for the fluxon\ntaking the two respective paths. \u03c6AC is the AharonovCasher phase accumulated by the fluxon: \u03c6AC = \u03c0Q/e.\nHere Q is the total charge enclosed by the trajectory of\nthe fluxon, including the offset charge Qext set by external gate and the fermion parity np of the low-energy\nfermionic states:\nQ = Qext + enp .\n\n(10)\n\nM\u0302 encodes the transformation solely due to the braiding statistics of the non-Abelian fluxon around n nonAbelian vortices.\nIf the superconducting island contains no vortices, then\nM\u0302 = 1 and the interference term is solely determined\nby the AC phase. The magnitude of the vortex current\nshows an oscillation:\nh\n\u0010 \u03c0Q \u0011i\n.\n(11)\nJv = Jv0 1 + \u03b6 cos\ne\nHere \u03b6 is the visibility of the interference.\nWhen n is odd, there is no interference because\nM\u0302 |\u03a80 i and |\u03a80 i have different fermion parity, implying\nh\u03a80 |M\u0302 |\u03a80 i = 0. The vortex current becomes independent of the charge encircled. Therefore, the disappearance of the interference can be used as a signature of the\nnon-Abelian statistics of the vortices.\nWe now consider a situation where the non-Abelian\nfluxon has midgap states other than the Majorana bound\nstate. The internal state of the fluxon then also depends\non the occupation of these midgap states. As we have\nargued in the previous section, as far as braiding is concerned the non-Abelian character is not affected at all by\nthe presence of midgap states. So the interference still\nvanishes when there are odd numbers of non-Abelian vortices in the island. On the other hand, when there are\nno vortices in the island, transitions to the midgap states\ncan significantly reduce the visibility of the interference\nterm \u03b6.\n\n\u0124 = |LihL| \u2297 \u0124L + |RihR| \u2297 \u0124R .\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u0124L,R is given by\nX\nX\n\u2206\n\u03c3z + \u03c3x\ngk (\u00e2\u2020\u03b7,k + \u00e2\u03b7,k ) +\n\u03c9\u03b7,k \u00e2\u2020\u03b7,k \u00e2\u03b7,k .\n2\nk\nk\n(13)\nHere \u03b7 = L, R. Notice that we assume the bath couples\nto the fluxon locally so we introduce two independent\nbaths for L and R paths. The unitary evolution at time\nt is then factorizable:\n\u0124\u03b7 =\n\n\u00db (t) = |LihL| \u2297 \u00dbL (t) + |RihR| \u2297 \u00dbR (t).\n\n(14)\n\nGiven initial state \u03c1\u0302(0) = \u03c1\u0302path \u2297 \u03c1\u0302s \u2297 \u03c1\u0302bath , we can\nfind the off-diagonal component of the final state \u03c1\u0302(t) =\n\u00db (t)\u03c1\u0302(0)\u00db \u2020 (t), corresponding to the interference, as\nh\ni\n\u03bbLR = Tr \u00dbL (t)\u00dbR\u2020 (t)\u03c1\u0302s \u2297 \u03c1\u0302bath\nh\ni (15)\n= Tr \u03c1s TrL [\u03c1\u0302bath,L \u00dbL (t)]TrR [\u03c1\u0302bath,R \u00dbR (t)] .\nNow we evaluate \u0174\u03b7 (t) = Tr\u03b7 [\u03c1\u0302bath,\u03b7 \u00db\u03b7 (t)] (notice \u0174\u03b7\nis still an operator in the spin Hilbert space). We drop\nthe \u03b7 index in this calculation. First we switch to interaction picture and the evolution operator \u00db (t) can be\nRt\nrepresented formally as \u00db (t) = T exp{\u2212i 0 dt0 \u01241 (t0 )}\nwhere\nX\n\u01241 (t) =\ngk (\u03c3 + ei\u2206t/2 +\u03c3 \u2212 e\u2212i\u2206t/2 )(\u00e2\u2020k ei\u03c9k t +\u00e2k e\u2212i\u03c9k t ).\nk\n\n(16)\nFollowing the derivation of the master equation for the\ndensity matrix, we can derive a \"master equation\" for\n\u0174 (t) under the Born-Markovian approximation:\nd\u0174\n= \u2212\u03b3(n + 1/2 + \u03c3z /2)\u0174 ,\n(17)\ndt\nP\nP\nwhere \u03b3 = \u03c0 k gk2 \u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212\u2206), n = \u03b3 \u22121 k gk2 nk \u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212\u2206).\nTherefore, the visibility of the interference, proportional to the trace of \u0174 , is given by\n\u03b6 \u221d Tr[\u0174 (t)\u03c1s ] \u221d e\u2212\u03b3nt = e\u2212\u03b3nL/v .\n\n(18)\n\nWe notice that the model we have used is of course a\nsimplification of the real fluxon. We only focus on the\ndecoherence due to the midgap states and assume that\n\n\f5\nonly one such state is present. In reality, there could be\nmany midgap states which lead to a stronger suppression\nof visibility.\nThe above interferometor is able to detect the existence\nof non-Abelian vortices which requires that the Josephson vortex (i.e. fluxon) also has Majorana midgap states.\nTo fully read out a topological qubit, one needs to measure the fermion parity of the qubit. This can also be\ndone using interferometry experiments with flux qubits,\nessentially making use of the AC effect of Josephson vortices43,44 .\nAnother relevant question is whether the thermal excitations of the (non-Majorana) midgap states localized\nin the vortex core have any effects on the interferometry. Since the interferometry is based on AC effect where\nvortex acquires a geometric phase after circling around\nsome charges, one might naively expect that the interferometric current might depend on the occupation of\nthe midgap states due to the Rcharge associated with the\nmidgap states (i.e. Qn = e dr (|un |2 \u2212 |vn |2 )). The\nsituation is more subtle, however, once one takes into\naccount the screening effect due to the superfluid condensate. The kinetics of the screening process is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. However, assuming equilibrium\nsituation more careful inspection discussed in the Appendix B shows the geometric phases acquired by the\nJosephson vortices only depends on the total fermion parity in the low-energy midgap states (even if they are not\nMajorana zero-energy modes) and the offset charge set\nby the external gate voltage.\n\nIV.\n\nDEPOLARIZATION OF QUBITS AT FINITE\nTEMPERATURE\n\nWe now study the coherence of the topological qubit\nitself. From our discussion on the effect of bound states\nin the vortex core, it is clear that decoherence only occurs when the qubit is interacting with a macroscopically\nlarge number of fermionic degrees of freedom, a fermionic\nbath. An example of such a bath is provided by the continuum of the gapped quasiparticles in the topological\nsuperconductor. Once the Majorana fermion is coupled\nto the bath via a tunneling Hamiltonian, the fermion\noccupation in the qubit can leak into the environment,\nresulting in the depolarization of the qubit. It is then\ncrucial to have a fully gapped quasiparticle spectrum to\nensure that such decoherence is exponentially small, as\nwill be shown below.\nTo study the decay of a Majorana zero mode, we consider two such modes, \u03b3\u03021 and \u03b3\u03022 , forming an ordinary\nfermion c = \u03b3\u03021 + i\u03b3\u03022 . The gapped fermions are coupled\nlocally to \u03b3\u03021 , without any loss of generality. The coupling is mediated by a bosonic bath. The Hamiltonian\n\nthen reads\n\u0124 = i\u03b5\u03b3\u03021 \u03b3\u03022 +\n\nX\n\n\u000fk d\u02c6\u2020k d\u02c6k +\n\nk\n\n+i\n\nX\n\ngkl \u03b3\u03021 (d\u02c6\u2020k\n\nX\n\n\u03c9l \u00e2\u2020l \u00e2l\n\nl\n\n+ d\u02c6k )(\u00e2\u2020l + \u00e2l ).\n\n(19)\n\nkl\n\nHere d\u02c6k is the annihilation operator of the gapped\nfermions with quantum number k and energy \u03b5k . \u00e2l is\nthe annihilation operators of the bosonic bath.\nThe density matrix of the system evolves according\nto the equation of motion \u03c1\u0302 \u0307 = \u2212i[\u0124, \u03c1\u0302]. Since we are\ninterested in the qubit only, we will derive the master\nequation for the reduced density matrix \u03c1\u0302r , tracing out\nthe bosonic bath and the gapped fermions.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03c1\u0302r\n= \u2212\u03bb \u03c1\u0302r \u2212 \u03b3\u03021 (\u22121)n\u0302 \u03c1\u0302r (\u22121)n\u0302 \u03b3\u03021 ,\ndt\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\n\u03bb=2\n\nX\n\n\u0002\n2\ngkl\n(1 \u2212 nfk )nbl + nfk (nbl + 1)]\u03b4(\u03b5k \u2212 \u03c9l ). (21)\n\nkl\n\nHere nfk = 1/(e\u03b5k /T + 1), nbl = 1/(e\u03c9l /T \u2212 1) are the\nFermi and Bose distribution functions. The derivation of\n(20) is presented in the Appendix A. Notice that at low\ntemperatures T \u001c \u2206, due to energy conservation, both\nnbl and nfk are suppressed by the Gibbs factor e\u2212\u2206/T .\nTherefore, the rate \u03bb \u223c e\u2212\u2206/T .\nThen the polarization of the qubit h\u03c3z i = Tr[\u03c3z \u03c1\u0302r ] satisfies dt h\u03c3z i = \u22122\u03bbh\u03c3z i. Therefore the lifetime of the\ntopological qubit is given by T1 \u223c \u03bb\u22121 . Physically, this is\nreasonable since we introduce tunneling term between the\nMajorana fermion and the gapped fermionic environment\nso the fermion parity of the qubit is no longer conserved.\nIt is expected that \u03bb is determined by the exponential\nfactor e\u2212\u2206/T when T \u001c \u2206. Therefore, this provides a\nquantitative calibration of the protection of the topological qubit at finite temperature. In the high-temperature\nlimit T \u001d \u2206, the distribution function scales linearly\nwith T so the decay rate is proportional to T . This is\nquite expected since T \u001d \u2206, the gap does not play a\nrole. We note that a recent work by Goldstein and Chamon31 studying the decay rate of Majorana zero modes\ncoupled to classical noise essentially corresponds to the\nhigh-temperature limit of our calculation T \u001d \u2206 and, as\nsuch, does not apply to any realistic system where the\ntemperature is assumed to be low, i.e. T \u001c \u2206.In fact,\nin the trivial limit of \u2206 \u001c T , the Majorana decoherence\nis large and weakly temperature dependent because the\nfermion parity is no longer preserved and the fermions\ncan simply leak into the fermionic bath45 . By definition, this classical limit of T \u001d \u2206 is of no interest for\nthe topological quantum computation schemes since the\ntopological superconductivity itself (or for that matter,\nany kind of superconductivity) will be completely absent\nin this regime. Our result makes sense from the qualitative considerations: quantum information is encoded\n\n\f6\nin non-local fermionic modes and changing fermion parity requires having large thermal fluctuations or external\nnoise sources with finite spectral weight at frequencies\n\u03c9 \u223c \u2206. Furthermore, it is important to notice that\nsuch relaxation can only occur when the qubit is coupled to a continuum of fermionic states which renders\nthe fermion parity of the qubit undefined. Intuitively,\nthe fermion staying in the qubit can tunnel to the continuum irreversibly, which is accounted for by the procedure of \"tracing out the bath\" in our derivation of the\nmaster equation. It is instructive to compare this result\nto a different scenario, where the zero-energy fermionic\nstate is coupled to a fermionic state (or a finite number\nof them) instead of a continuum. In that case, due to\nhybridization between the states the fermion number oscillates between the two levels with a period (recurrence\ntime) determined by the energy difference \u2206E between\nthem. The expectation value of the fermion number (or\nspectral weight) in the zero-energy state is depleted and\noscillatory in time, but will not decay to zero.\nThe above derivation can be straightforwardly generalized to N > 2 Majorana fermions, each coupled locally\nto gapped fermions and bosonic bath.\nN\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03c1\u0302r\n=\u2212\n\u03bbi \u03c1\u0302r \u2212 \u03b3\u0302i (\u22121)n\u0302i \u03c1\u0302r (\u22121)n\u0302i \u03b3\u0302i ,\ndt\ni=1\n\n(22)\n\nThe depolarization of the qubit can be calculated in the\nsame fashion.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe study quantum coherence of the Majorana-based\ntopological qubits. We analyze the non-Abelian braiding in the presence of midgap states, and demonstrate\nthat when formulating in terms of the physical observable (fermion parity of the qubit), the braiding statistics\nis insensitive to the thermal occupation of the midgap\nstates. We also clarify here the conditions for such topological protection to hold. Our conclusion applies to the\ncase of localized midgap states in the vortex core which\nare transported along with the Majorana zero states during the braiding operations. If there are spurious (e.g.\nimpurity-induced46\u201348 ) midgap bound states spatially located near the Majorana zero-energy states but are not\ntransported together with them, they could strongly affect braiding operations. For example, during braiding\nthe fermion in the qubit has some probability (roughly\ndetermined by the non-adiabaticity of the braiding operation) to hybridize with the other bound states near\nits path leading to an error. If the disorder is weak and\nshort-ranged, such low-energy states are unlikely to occur unless the bulk superconducting gap is significantly\nsuppressed at some spatial points (e.g. vortices) as it is\nwell-known that for a single short-range impurity the energy of such a bound state is close to the bulk excitation\ngap49,50 . Thus, well-separated impurity-induced bound\n\nstates are typically close to the gap edge and would not\naffect braiding operations. If the concentration of impurities is increased, then it is meaningful to discuss the probability distribution of the lowest excited bound state in\nthe system51 . The distribution of the first excited states\ndeterming the minigaps depends on many microscopic\ndetails (e.g. system size, concentration of the disorder).\nSince the magnitude of the minigaps is system-specific,\none should evaluate the minigap for a given sample. As\na general guiding principle, it is important to reduce the\neffect of the disorder which limits the speed of braiding\noperations. However, we note here that physically moving anyons for braiding operations might not be necessary\nand there are alternative measurement-only approaches\nto topological quantum computation52 where the issue of\nthe low-lying localized bound states is not relevant.\nIn this paper we also consider the read-out of topological qubits via interferometry experiments. We study the\nMach-Zehnder interferometer based on Aharonov-Casher\neffect and show that the main effect of midgap states\nin the Josephson vortices is the reduction of the visibility of the read-out signal. We also consider the effect of\nthermal excitations involving midgap states of Abrikosov\nvortices localized in the bulk on the interferometry and\nfind that such processes do not effect the signal provided\nthe system reaches equilibrium fast enough compared to\nthe tunneling time of the Josephson vortices.\nFinally, we address the issue of the quantum coherence of the topological qubit itself coupled to a gapped\nfermionic bath via quantum fluctuations. We derive the\nmaster equation governing the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the topological qubit using a simple physical model Hamiltonian. The decoherence rate\nof the qubit is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures T \u001c \u2206. Since topological protection assumes that\nfermion parity in the superconductor is preserved, our\nresult is very intuitive.\nWe conclude that the Majorana-based qubits are indeed topologically well-protected at low temperatures as\nlong as the experimental temperature regime is well below the superconducting gap energy.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe thanks Chang-Yu Hou, Liang Jiang, Chetan Nayak\nand Kirill Shtengel for illuminating discussion.
