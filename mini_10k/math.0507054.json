This function is supposed to be increasing, so that\nthe random walk is attracted by bigger clusters. For f (t) = e\u03b2t we\nprove that there is a phase transition in \u03b2, i.e., the random walk is\nsubdiffusive for large \u03b2 and is diffusive for small \u03b2.\nKeywords: subcritical percolation, subdiffusivity, reversibility, spectral gap\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and results\n\nFirst, we describe the usual site percolation model in Zd . This model is\ndefined as follows. For fixed p \u2208 (0, 1), consider i.i.d. random variables \u03c9(x),\nx \u2208 Zd , where \u03c9(x) = 1 with probability p and \u03c9(x) = 0 with probability\n1 \u2212 p. A site x is said to be open if \u03c9(x) = 1 and closed otherwise. Write\nx \u223c z if x and z are neighbors. A (self-avoiding) path from x to y is:\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\nPartially supported by CNPq (302981/2002\u20130)\nPartially supported by CNPq (306029/2003\u20130)\n\n1\n\n\f\u03b3(x, y) = {x0 = x, x1 , x2 , . . . , xn = y}, where xi 6= xj if i 6= j and xi \u223c xi+1 ,\ni = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. A path \u03b3 is said to be open if all the sites in \u03b3 are open.\nThe cluster of x is defined by\nC(x) = {y \u2208 Zd : \u03c9(y) = 1 and there is an open path \u03b3(x, y) from x to y}.\nNote that, if \u03c9(x) = 0, then C(x) = \u2205. It is a well-known fact (see e.g. [9])\nthat there exists pcr (depending on d; obviously, pcr = 1 in dimension 1) such\nthat if p < pcr , then a.s. there is no infinite open cluster, and if p > pcr ,\nthen a.s. there exists an infinite open cluster (also, with positive probability\n|C(0)| = \u221e).\nThroughout this paper we assume that p < pcr , i.e, the model is in\nthe (strictly) subcritical regime. Fix a parameter \u03b2 > 0. The percolation\nconfiguration is regarded as random environment. Fixed the environment,\nwe start a discrete time random walk on Zd with transition probabilities\ne\u03b2|C(y)|\n\u03c9\nPxy\n= P \u03b2|C(z)| ,\ne\nz\u223cx\n\nif x \u223c y. Since \u03b2 is positive, one can note that the random walk is in some\nsense \"attracted\" by bigger clusters, and the strength of this attraction grows\nwith \u03b2. Denote by \u03be(t) the position of this random walk at time t. Let P be\nthe probability measure with respect to \u03c9 and Px\u03c9 the (so-called quenched)\nprobability for the random walk starting from x in the fixed environment \u03c9.\nDenote also Px = Px\u03c9 \u2297 P (Px is usually called the annealed probability);\nthroughout the paper k * k stands for the L\u221e norm. Our main result is\nthat there is a phase transition in \u03b2, i.e., the random walk exhibits different\nbehaviors for large and small \u03b2: it is diffusive for small values of \u03b2 and\nsubdiffusive for large values of \u03b2.\nTheorem 1.1 Suppose that the random walk \u03be(t) starts from the origin.\nThere exist \u03b20 and \u03b21 (depending on d) such that 0 < \u03b20 \u2264 \u03b21 < \u221e and\n(i) if 0 < \u03b2 < \u03b20 , then\n\n1\nlog max0\u2264s\u2264t k\u03be(s)k\n= ,\nt\u2192\u221e\nlog t\n2\nlim\n\nP0 -a.s.\n\n(1.1)\n\n(ii) if \u03b2 > \u03b21 , then\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nlog max0\u2264s\u2264t k\u03be(s)k\n1\n< ,\nlog t\n2\n2\n\nP0 -a.s.\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fOne can prove also that the same result holds for the bond percolation\nmodel in the subcritical regime. The method of the proof remains the same;\nthe reason why we have chosen the site percolation is that for bond percolation there are some technical difficulties (easily manageable, though; they\nrelate to the fact that, in the bond percolation model, two neighboring sites\ncan belong to different large clusters) in the proof of the part (ii) of Theorem 1.1.\nRecently much work has been done on the (simple or not) random walk on\nthe unique infinite cluster for the supercritical (bond or site) percolation in\nZd (see e.g. [2, 4, 10, 15]; see also [11] for some results for the random walk on\nthe incipient infinite cluster in dimension 2). Another related subject is the\nclass of models (see e.g. [5, 8]) that can be described as follows. Into each edge\nof Zd we place a random variable that represents the transition rate between\nthe sites. The new features of the model of the present paper are, first,\nthe fact that the random environment is not independent, and secondly, the\nabsence of the uniform ellipticity. Speaking of uniform ellipticity, we should\nmention that in the paper [7] there was considered a simple symmetric onedimensional random walk with random rates, where the time spent at site i\nbefore taking a step has an exponential distribution with mean \u03c4i , and \u03c4i 's\nare i.i.d. positive random variables with distribution function F having a\npolinomial tail. One may find that there are similarities of the d-dimensional\nanalog of the model of [7] with our model, because clusters of size n will have\n\"density\" e\u2212Cn , and the mean time spent there is roughly e\u03b2n , so, thinking\nof clusters as \"sites\", we indeed obtain a polinomial tail of mean time spent\nat a given site. However, the facts that the random environment is no longer\nindependent and that here the random walk is not a time-change of the\nsimple random walk make the model of the present paper considerably more\ndifficult to analyze.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1\n\nWe begin by introducing some notations and recalling a well-known fact from\nthe percolation theory. Namely, we will use the following result (see [12, 9]):\nif p < pcr , then there exists c1 > 0 such that for all N > 0 and x \u2208 Zd\nP[|C(x)| > N] \u2264 e\u2212c1 N .\n\n3\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fNow, to prove Theorem 1.1, an important idea is to consider \u03be(t) in finite\nregion. Take \u039bn = (\u2212n/2, n/2]d and let the process \u03be (n) (t) be the random\nwalk \u03be(t) restricted on \u039bn .\nProof of part (i). It can be easily seen that \u03be(t) is reversible with the reversible\nmeasure\nX\n\u03c0(x) = e\u03b2|C(x)|\ne\u03b2|C(z)| ,\n(2.2)\nz\u223cx\n\nand thus the finite Markov chain \u03be (n) (t) is also reversible, with the invariant\n(and reversible) measure\nP \u03b2|C(z)|\ne\u03b2|C(x)|\ne\nz\u223cx\n(n)\n\u03c0 (x) =\n,\n(2.3)\nZ\nwhere\nZ=\n\nX\n\ne\u03b2|C(x)|\n\nX\n\ne\u03b2|C(z)|\n\nz\u223cx\n\nx\u2208\u039bn\n\nis the normalizing constant, so that x\u2208\u039bn \u03c0 (n) (x) = 1.\nConsider also a random walk \u03be\u02c6(n) (t) that is a continuization of \u03be (n) (t).\nThat is, \u03be\u02c6(n) (t) = \u03be (n) (Nt ), where Nt is a Poisson process with rate 1, independent of anything else (in other words, \u03be\u02c6(n) is a continuous time Markov chain\nwith the transition rates equal to the transition probabilities of \u03be (n) ).\nTi\nPLet\nn\nbe the time interval between the jumps (i \u2212 1) and i of Nt , Sn = i=1 Ti ,\nand T\u0302A (respectively, TA ) be hitting time of set A by random walk \u03be\u02c6(n) (t)\n(respectively, \u03be (n) (t)). It can be easily seen (cf., for example, Chapter 2 of [1])\nthat T\u0302A = STA and E(T\u0302A | TA ) = TA . Moreover, since t\u22121 Nt \u2192 1 a.s., many\nother results concerning \u03be\u02c6(n) can be easily translated into the corresponding\nresults for \u03be (n) .\nP\n\nRemark 2.1 Using this technique, it is elementary to obtain that Theo\u02c6\n\u02c6 is the continuization\nrem 1.1 holds for \u03be(t) iff it holds for \u03be(t),\nwhere \u03be(t)\nof \u03be(t) defined in the same way.\nSo, now we consider the finite continuous time Markov chain \u03be\u02c6(n) (t). Denote by \u03bb the spectral gap of \u03be\u02c6(n) (t).\nLemma 2.1 There exist c14 > 0 and n\u2217 = n\u2217 (\u03c9) such that for all n > n\u2217 we\nhave \u03bb \u2265 c14 n\u22122 , P-a.s.\n4\n\n\fProof of Lemma 2.1. The idea is to use Theorem 3.2.1 from [14] to prove\nthe lemma. For each pair x, y \u2208 \u039bn , we will choose exactly one path \u03b3(x, y)\n(connecting x and y) in a way described below. Let |\u03b3(x, y)| be the length\nof \u03b3(x, y) (i.e. the number of edges in \u03b3(x, y)). Denote by E(\u039bn ) the set\nof edges of Zd \u2229 \u039bn . For an edge u = hz1 , z2 i let Q(u) = (Pz\u03c91 z2 \u03c0 (n) (z1 ) +\nPz\u03c92 z1 \u03c0 (n) (z2 ))/2. According to Theorem 3.2.1 of [14], it holds that \u03bb \u2265 1/A,\nwhere\nn 1\no\nX\nA = max\n|\u03b3(x, y)|\u03c0 (n) (x)\u03c0 (n) (y) .\n(2.4)\nu\u2208E(\u039bn ) Q(u)\nx,y\u2208\u039bn : \u03b3(x,y)\u220bu\n\nHere, we have, for u = hz1 , z2 i,\nQ(u) =\n\ne\u03b2(|C(z1 )|+|C(z2 )|)\nZ\n\nand for each pair x = (x(1) , . . . , x(d) ), y = (y (1) , . . . , y (d) ) \u2208 \u039bn we choose the\npath \u03b3(x, y) in the following way. Let e1 , . . . , ed be the coordinate vectors.\nDenote \u2206i = y (i) \u2212 x(i) and let sgn(\u2206i ) be the sign of \u2206i . Suppose for\ndefiniteness that x(d) \u2264 y (d) (so that sgn(\u2206d ) \u2265 0).

Thus, with probability at least\n2\nwe have \u03c0 (f ) \u2265 const. Then, using that Var(n)\n\u03c0 (f ) \u2264 1, taking t = c16 n\nfor c16 large enough yields that the random walk \u03be\u02c6(n) (t), and thus \u03be (n) (t), will\nbe at distance of order n from the origin (as both random walks start from\n0) after a time of order n2 with probability bounded away from 0.\nNow, for any fixed \u03b5 > 0, divide the time interval (0, t] into t\u03b5 intervals of\nlength t1\u2212\u03b5 .

Borel-Cantelli lemma and (2.17) imply (2.16) and thus the\npart (i) of Theorem 1.1 is proved.\nProof of part (ii). For x \u2208 Zd let T0 (x) = 0, T0\u2032 (x) = 0, and define\n\u2032\nTi\u2032 (x) = min{t \u2265 Ti\u22121 (x) + Ti\u22121\n(x) : \u03be(t) \u2208 C(x)}\n\u2032\nTi (x) = min{t > Ti (x) : \u03be(t) \u2208\n/ C(x)} \u2212 Ti\u2032 (x),\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, . . ., where Ti (x) is defined if min{t \u2265 Tk (x) : \u03be(t) \u2208 C(x)},\nk \u2264 i, are finite. In words, Ti\u2032 (x) is the moment of ith entry to the cluster\nof x, and Ti (x) is the time spent there (i.e., after Ti\u2032 (x) and before going\nout of C(x)). It is important to note that the cluster C(x) is surrounded by\nsites with \u03c9(*) = 0. Comparing Ti (x) with geometric random variable with\nparameter (2d \u22121 + e\u03b2|C(x)| )\u22121 , one can easily see that if |C(x)| \u2265 \u03b4 log n, then\nETi (x) \u2265 c17 n\u03b2\u03b4 . Moreover, it is elementary to obtain that for \u03b5 > 0 and for\nany \u03b4 > 0 we can choose \u03b2 large enough so that with probability bounded\naway from 0 we have\nTi (x) \u2265 c18 n2+\u03b5\n(2.18)\nfor x such that |C(x)| \u2265 \u03b4 log n.\nNow, we use a dynamic construction of the percolation environment usually called the generation method (see [12]). That is, we proceed in the\nfollowing way: we assign generation index 0 to the origin, and put \u03c9(0) = 1\n(the origin is open) with probability p or \u03c9(0) = 0 (closed) with probability\n1 \u2212 p. If \u03c9(0) = 0, the process stops. If \u03c9(0) = 1, then to all x \u223c 0 we\nassign generation index 1, and put \u03c9(x) = 1 with probability p or \u03c9(x) = 0\nwith probability 1 \u2212 p, independently. Suppose that the we constructed m\ngenerations of the process. Let Yi be the set of sites with generation index i\nand Y m = {0} \u222a Y1 \u222a . . . \u222a Ym . Denote by Ym+1 the set of neighbors of the\nopen sites in Ym which do not belong to Y m . Assign to the sites from Ym+1\nthe generation index m + 1 and a value 1 or 0 in a way described above. If\nYm 6= \u2205 and \u03c9(y) = 0 for all y \u2208 Ym+1 , then the process stops. Note that\nfor subcritical percolation this process stops a.s., and what we obtain at the\n10\n\n\fmoment when the process stops is the cluster of the origin surrounded by\n0-s.\nSo, first we construct the environment within the set H1 = C(0) \u222a \u2202C(0),\nwhere\n\u2202C(0) = {y : y \u2208\n/ C(0), y \u223c x for some x \u2208 C(0)}\n\n(note that \u03c9(y) = 0 for any y \u2208 \u2202C(0)) and we know nothing yet about the\nenvironment out of the set H1 . For an arbitrary set H \u2282 Zd denote\nH \u25e6 = {x \u2208\n/ H : for any infinite path \u03b3(x) starting from x it holds\nthat \u03b3(x) \u2229 H 6= \u2205}\n(i.e., H \u25e6 is the set of the holes within the set H) and let\nG1 = H1 \u222a H1\u25e6 .\n\nThen, choose \u03c9(x) for x \u2208 H1\u25e6 and start the random walk \u03be(t) from the origin.\nLet\n\u03c41 = min{t : \u03be(t) \u2208\n/ G1 }.\nNote that C(\u03be(\u03c41 )) \u2229 C(0) = \u2205, and construct, using the above method\nH2 = C(\u03be(\u03c41 )) \u222a \u2202C(\u03be(\u03c41 ))\nand\nThen, define\n\nG2 = G1 \u222a H2 \u222a (G1 \u222a H2 )\u25e6 .\n\u03c42 = min{t : \u03be(t) \u2208\n/ G2 },\n\nand so on. For all i, we have\n\nP[C(\u03be(\u03c4i )) \u2265 \u03b4 log n] \u2265 p\u03b4 log n\nwhere p is the percolation parameter. This is so due to the fact that, to have\nC(\u03be(\u03c4i )) \u2265 \u03b4 log n, it is sufficient to choose a path of length \u03b4 log n emanating\nfrom \u03be(\u03c4i ) which does not intersect Gi (it is possible by the construction of\n\u03c4i , since \u03be(\u03c4i ) cannot be completely surrounded by points of Gi ), and such\npath will be open with probability p\u03b4 log n . Thus, for any \u03b5 > 0 (one can take\nthe same \u03b5 from (2.18)), we can choose \u03b4 small enough (take \u03b4 such that\n\u03b4 log p\u22121 < \u03b5) so that\nP0 [C(\u03be(\u03c4i )) \u2265 \u03b4 log n | Fi ] \u2265 n\u2212\u03b5 ,\n11\n\n(2.19)\n\n\fwhere Fi is the \u03c3-algebra generated by {\u03c9(x), x \u2208 Gi } and {\u03be(m), m \u2264 \u03c4i }.\nFix \u03b8 > 0 in such a way that 1 \u2212 \u03b8 > \u03b5. Note that, as p < pcr , using (2.1)\nand Borel-Cantelli lemma, for n large enough min{k : \u03be(\u03c4k ) \u2208\n/ \u039bn } (the\nnumber of times that we repeat the basic step in the above construction)\nwill be of order at least n1\u2212\u03b8 for all n large enough, P0 -a.s. (recall that\n\u039bn = (\u2212n/2, n/2]d ; with overwhelming probability all the clusters inside\n\u039bn will be of sizes at most n\u03b8 ). On each step, by (2.19), with probability at\nleast n\u2212\u03b5 the random walk enters the cluster of size at least \u03b4 log n. By (2.18),\nit stays in that cluster (if \u03b2 is large enough) for at least n2+\u03b5 time units with\nlarge probability. If 1 \u2212 \u03b8 > \u03b5, with overwhelming probability on some step\n(of the above construction) the random walk will delay (in the corresponding\ncluster) for more than n2+\u03b5 time units before going out of \u039bn . In other words,\nwe will have\ndn\nmax\nk\u03be(s)k \u2264\n,\n2+\u03b5\ns\u2264n\n2\nwhich implies (1.2). This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Aldous, J.A.
