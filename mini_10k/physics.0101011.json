This tendency towards\nminiaturization has led to the exploration of optical microcavities whose dimensions are of the order of a few wavelengths [1]. In such microcavities the extreme\nconfinement of the electromagnetic field modifies the interaction of the active\nmedium with the radiation field so that the process of spontaneous emission\nis altered both in its spatial and its dynamical characteristics. Spontaneous\nemission can thus be redirected, enhanced or inhibited in a way that may be\nexploited for the operation of light-emitting diodes or lasers. A modification\nof the characteristics of spontaneous emission, such as its directionality or the\nemission rate, has been shown for several microcavity designs such as for the\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Atomic Force Microscope image of a \"hill\" of diameter 7.2 \u03bcm and\nparabolic cross-section of height 1.8 \u03bcm, etched on a GaAs substrate by a Focused Ion Beam apparatus. When covered with gold it constitutes a concave\nparabolic mirror with its focal point inside the GaAs substrate.\ntraditional Fabry-Perot planar cavities [2] and for disk-shaped [3] or spherical\n[4] cavities displaying whispering gallery modes.\nOne of the key requirements for enhancing the dynamics of spontaneous\nemission and reducing the laser threshold is that the electromagnetic field at\nthe site of the emitting dipole should be enhanced inside the cavity with respect to its value in free space. A class of resonators for which this can be\nachieved very efficiently are confocal cavities: A few experiments with spherical confocal cavities [5], or semi-confocal microcavities [6] have been reported\nalready, in which significant spontaneous emission modification or extremely\nlow laser thresholds have been observed. Among the different designs of concave mirrors, parabolic mirrors have an important advantage in that their focal\npoint displays no astigmatism and is free from spherical aberrations. Basic geometric optic thus leads us to expect that double-parabolic confocal cavities or\nplano-parabolic semi-confocal cavities should display a strong enhancement of\nthe electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the focal point, and a concomitant\nmodification of the emission characteristics of an active medium placed there.\nThis paper presents a theoretical analysis of microcavities formed by a\nparabolic mirror at or close to the confocal condition. The study is motivated\nby experimental work in which such a system has in fact been fabricated. The\nexperimental characterization of the modal structure and dynamics, being now\nin progress, will be given in a separate publication [7]. Here, we briefly describe\nthe experimental structure, in order to define the system for which our model\ncalculations are intended. We have fabricated a semi-confocal plano-parabolic\nsemiconductor microcavity (see Fig. 1) by etching an appropriately-prepared\nGaAs wafer by a Focused Ion Beam [8] to produce a \"hill\" of cylindrical symmetry and parabolic vertical cross-section having a diameter of 7.2 \u03bcm and\na height of 1.8 \u03bcm (corresponding to optical lengths of respectively 27 \u03bb and\n6.75 \u03bb for a wavelength (in vacuo) of 960 nm) which was subsequently covered\nwith a thin metallic layer of gold. This gold dome constituted thus a concave\n3\n\n\fFigure 2: Schematic cross-section of a semiconfocal parabolic dome cavity, consisting of parabolic gold mirror and a planar Bragg mirror placed at the focal\nplane of the parabola. The cavity spacer is made of GaAs, and the light emitter\nis a quantum well placed in the vicinity of the focal plane.\nparabolic mirror with its focal point inside the GaAs substrate. At the base of\nthe parabolic hill, the wafer had a 6-period GaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror, closing\nthe semi-confocal cavity (see Fig. 2). This cavity is expected to possess a mode\nin which the electric field is strongly enhanced in the vicinity of the focal point,\nso that a localized semiconductor emitter, such as a quantum box or quantum\nwell, emitting at a wavelength near 960 nm, will have its spontaneous emission\ngreatly enhanced when placed there. The use of a dielectric mirror with lower\nrefractive index rather than a metallic mirror at the focal plane is important\nbecause it introduces a boundary condition that requires the tangential electric\nfield to be maximal at the focal plane. This condition cannot be fulfilled on a\nmetallic mirror, on which the tangential electric field should vanish, producing\nthus a vanishing field at the focal point of the parabola.\nIn order to understand the operation of such a cavity and to assess its performance in modifying spontaneous emission, in this paper, we examine first the\nmodal structure of an ideal confocal double-parabolic, or semi-confocal planoparabolic microcavity. We then investigate the stability of these modes with\nrespect to geometric deformations of the cavity that correspond to deviations\nfrom confocality; this condition is inevitably violated in a realistic cavity due\nto fabrication defects. The discussion of this case provides the conceptual and\ntheoretical background for the experimental analysis to be presented in a subsequent paper.\nThe calculation of the modal structure of the parabolic dome microresonators\ncannot be treated within the paraxial approximation of conventional [11] resonator theory, because of the very large aperture displayed by the parabola and\nbecause the cavity dimensions are comparable with the optical wavelength. Extensions of the paraxial approximation to the highly convergent (or divergent)\nbeams produced by parabolic mirrors are cumbersome even in macroscopic resonators [9] where the optical axis is long compared with the wavelength \u2013 in\nmicroresonators, the latter breaks down as well. However, there are other approximate techniques which are well-suited to the problem we consider. As\na valuable tool for simplifying the exact solution of Maxwell's equations for\nthe cavity modes, we employ a short-wavelength approximation leading to simple WKB quantization conditions. The assumption that wavelengths are much\n\n4\n\n\fshorter than the relevant cavity dimensions is common to both WKB and paraxial approximation, and it is therefore at first sight surprising that the WKB approach yields excellent quantitative agreement with the exact cavity spectrum\neven for the longest-wavelength modes of the parabolic cavity. We show how\nthis arises by discussing in detail the structure of the classical ray dynamics in\nthe resonator which makes the WKB approximation possible. As a result, we\nshall then also be able to assess the stability of the modal structure with regard\nto fabrication imperfections, based on a ray analysis for parabolic cavities in\ncases where confocality is violated. To characterize the modes of the parabolic\nresonator, the internal caustic structure formed by the rays turns out to be of\ncrucial importance. These considerations establish a connection between the the\nmicrocavity optics of the paraboloic dome and the field of quantum chaos: even\nminute deviations from confocality introduce chaos into the ray dynamics, and\nwe have to address the significance of this effect for the relevant cavity modes.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2, introduces the mathematical\nmodel that describes confocal parabolic cavities, while Section 3 presents the\nwave equation for the electromagnetic field in cylindrical and parabolic coordinates and discusses its exact vectorial and scalar solutions. Section 4 presents\nthe WKB approximation of the wave equations for the parabolic cavity, an approach that will permit us in Section 6 to make the connection with ray optics,\nwhile Section 5 compares the numerical solutions of the wave equations in the\nparabolic microcavity with those of the WKB approximation. Section 6 introduces the main concepts of ray optics applied to our parabolic cavities with\ncylindrical symmetry, while Section 7 analyzes the stability of the ray trajectories in a parabolic cavity in which there is a slight deviation from confocality.\nSection 8 discusses the problem of the finite acceptance angle of Bragg mirrors,\na feature that limits the lifetime of modes in semiconfocal cavities bounded by\nsuch mirrors. Finally, Section 9 summarizes the results of this study and gives\nits conclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nWe consider a model structure for an ideal semi-confocal cavity which is bounded\nby a metallic concave parabolic mirror on one side and a planar dielectric mirror\non the other side, placed at the focal plane of the parabola.\nIn cylindrical coordinates (\u03c1, z, \u03c6) the parabolic mirror is given by\nz=f\u2212\n\n\u03c12\n4f\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f is the focal distance of the parabola, while the focal plane (and the\nplanar mirror) corresponds to\nz=0\n(2)\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: (a) Representation of parabolic cylinder coordinates in the z - \u03c1 plane\nof a cylindrical coordinate system (z is the vertical axis). The third dimension\nis obtained by rotating the figure around \u1e91 by the angle \u03c6. The point A is\nspecified by \u03be = 1.3 f , \u03b7 = 0.9 f and \u03c6 = 0. The focus of all parabolas is at\nthe origin. (b) By unfolding the parabolic dome into a double paraboloid, the\nboundary conditions on the common focal plane can be restated as simple parity\nrequirement under reflection at this plane (z = 0). For TE modes, the electric\nfield must be even under this reflection. The unfolded cavity is shown in side\nview with meridians which make 90\u25e6 -corners at the focal plane. The latter is\nalso the equatorial plane of the cavity.\nIt is convenient to describe this cavity in parabolic coordinates (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c6), whose\nproperties are summarized in the Appendix. For reference, we reproduce here\nthe transformation to cylindrical coordinates as given in Eq. (99):\n\u001a\n\u221a\n\u03c1 = \u03be\u03b7\n(3)\nz = 12 (\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)\nTo illustrate this coordinate system, we show in Fig. 3 (a) how the intersection\nof the coordinate surfaces defines a point A in the plane z versus \u03c1. Also shown\nis the cavity shape itself: the parabolic mirror corresponds to\n\u03be = 2 f,\n\n(4)\n\nand the planar dielectric mirror is at\n\u03be = \u03b7.\n\n(5)\n\nIn an ideal cavity, the parabolic metallic mirror can be assumed to be lossless,\ndisplaying an amplitude reflectivity r = -1. This produces a \u03c0 phase change upon\nreflection so that it corresponds to a boundary condition in which the tangential\nelectric field vanishes. In parabolic coordinates this can be expressed as\nE\u03b7 (\u03be = 2f ) = 0\n\nE\u03c6 (\u03be = 2f ) = 0\n\nB\u03be (\u03be = 2f ) = 0\n\n(6)\n\nSimilarly, the planar dielectric mirror can be assumed to have a reflectivity of r =\n+1, producing no phase change upon reflection so that the tangential magnetic\nfield vanishes on the focal plane of the cavity. In cylindrical coordinates, this\ncan be expressed as\nB\u03c1 (z = 0) = B\u03c6 (z = 0) = 0\n6\n\nand Ez (z = 0) = 0\n\n(7)\n\n\fAlternatively, this implies that the tangential electric field is maximum on the\nfocal plane and is symmetric under reflection of the whole cavity at the z = 0\nplane. Thus, instead of considering this plane as an additional boundary with\nthe properties (7), one can unfold the cavity across this plane by reflection, to\nobtain a confocal double paraboloid shown in Fig. 3 (b). This extended cavity\nrequires only the metallic boundary conditions on its parabolic walls, that is\nEq. (6) and its equivalent in which \u03be and \u03b7 are interchanged. It will support\nmodes that can be either symmetric or antisymmetric under reflection at the\nfocal plane. If we restrict ourselves to modes in which E\u03c1 and E\u03c6 are symmetric,\nthis subset is identical to the modes of the original dome with the conditions of\nEqs. (6) and (7).\nThe advantage of considering the unfolded cavity is that the focal plane as a\nphysical boundary drops out of the discussion; this will considerably simplify the\ninterpretation in terms of the ray picture later on. Therefore, in the remainder\nof this paper, we can refer to Fig. 3 (b) as our model system.\n\n3\n\nWave equation\n\n~ obeys the vectorial wave equation\nThe electric field E\n~ + \u03bc\u01eb\n\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7E\n\n~\n\u2202 2E\n=0\n2\n\u2202t\n\n(8)\n\nunder the additional constraint that its divergence must vanish\n~ = 0.\n\u2207*E\n\n(9)\n\nThe boundary conditions and the constraint of zero divergence imposed on\nthe electromagnetic field in general will lead to a coupling between the various\nvectorial components of the electric and magnetic fields. In simpler geometries\nsuch as cylinders, spheres or rectangular cavities, a suitable choice of polarizations reduces the problem to finding the eigensolutions of a scalar Helmholtz\nequation [10]. However, in our case the three polarizations and the intersecting\nparabolic surfaces forming the resonator cannot be labeled by the coordinate\nlines of a single orthogonal coordinate system, as is possible in the textbook\nsystems mentioned. We discuss now the implications of this complication.\n\n3.1\n\nVector field components in cylindrical coordinates\n\nAfter combining Eqs.

One can achieve a further simplification in this system of equations as\nfollows:\nThe rotational symmetry around the z axis permits us to assume a \u03c6dependence of all components of the field of the form\nQ(\u03c1, z) * eim\u03c6 .\nWith this ansatz, Eqs. (11 a,b) can be written as\n\uf8f1 2\u0002 2\n\u0003\n\uf8f2 \u03c1 \u2207 + k 2 E\u03c1 \u2212 E\u03c1 = 2imE\u03c6\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c12 \u22072 + k 2 E\u03c6 \u2212 E\u03c6 = \u22122imE\u03c1\n\n(12)\n\n(a)\n(13)\n(b)\n\n\u221a\nwhere k = \u03bc\u01eb\u03c9 is the wavenumber inside the parabolic dome. If the azimuthal\nquantum number m = 0, this reduces to two identical equations. If, on the other\nhand, m 6= 0, we can form a suitable linear combination of E\u03c1 and E\u03c6 which\ndecouples these two equations. Naively setting E\u03c6 = 0 would not achieve this\ngoal because it forces both field components to vanish.\nThe proper linear combination in which to decouple this system of differential\nequations is obtained with the definition\n\uf8f1\ni\n\uf8f2 E\u03c1 \u2261 \u221a2 (E+ \u2212 E\u2212 )\n(14)\n\uf8f3\nE\u03c6 \u2261 \u221a12 (E+ + E\u2212 ).\nThen E\u00b1 are the solutions of the equations\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03c12 \u22072 + k 2 E\u00b1 = (1 \u00b1 2m)E\u00b1\n\n(15)\n\nThis definition again makes use of the azimuthal symmetry\nof\u0011 the resonator,\n\u0010\ni\nwhich implies that the circular polarizations \u03c3\u0302\u00b1 = \u2213 \u221a2 \u03c1\u0302 \u00b1 i\u03c6\u0302 are decoupled\nin the cylindrical wave equation. In this way, we have therefore formally decoupled the original system of equations Eq. (11) for the vector field components.\n8\n\n\fIn the special case m = 0, case E+ and E\u2212 will moreover be linearly dependent\nbecause their respective equations again coincide.\nHowever, this decoupling of polarizations in the wave equation does not\nreduce the problem to a truly scalar one because the field components are still\ncoupled by the boundary conditions and by the condition of zero divergence.\nOn the \"top\" parabolic mirror, the conditions (6) in terms of the cylindrical\ncomponents of the electric field now read:\n\uf8f1 \u221a\n\u221a\ni f (E+ \u2212 E\u2212 ) + \u03b7Ez = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nE+ + E\u2212 = 0\nat \u03be = 2f\n(16)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2202\n\u2202\u03b7 (E+ + E\u2212 ) = 0.\n\nThe first line expresses the condition E\u03b7 = 0, the second and third lines represent\nE\u03c6 = 0 and B\u03be = 0, respectively. On the \"bottom\" parabolic mirror the\nboundary conditions are the same as in Eq. (16) with \u03be and \u03b7 interchanged.\n\n3.2\n\nThe absence of longitudinal electromagnetic modes\n\nUnfortunately, the set of boundary conditions Eq. (16) is not yet a complete\nlist of constraints that we have to satisfy. An additional requirement is that\nthe field at every point in the resonator has to have zero divergence, which in\nparabolic coordinates reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2\u03be\u03b7\n(E+ \u2212 E\u2212 )\n*\n+\nE+ \u2212 E\u2212 + m(E+ + E\u2212 ) +\n\u03be+\u03b7\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2i 2\u03be\u03b7\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\nEz = 0 (17)\n* \u03be\n+\u03b7\n\u03be+\u03b7\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03b7\nThis assumption already entered the derivation of the system of wave equation,\nEq. (10), from the original Maxwell equations in the form of Eq. (8). However,\nthis does not guarantee that all solutions of Eq. (10) or Eq. (11) satisfy Eq.\n(17). The latter is just the well-known statement that the electromagnetic field\nis purely transverse, ruling out longitudinal modes: the transverse electric field\n~ \u22a5 is related to the curl of the magnetic field by the Maxwell equation\nE\n~\n~ = 1 \u2202 B = ik E~\u22a5 ,\n\u2207\u00d7B\nc \u2202t\n\n(18)\n\n~ \u22a5 = 0; the longitudinal field E\n~ k , which can be written\nand hence satisfies \u2207 * E\nas the gradient of a potential \u03a6, is responsible for violations of Eq. (17).\nIn view of the constraints imposed by the boundary conditions (16) and by\nthe zero divergence condition (17) it is not possible (except for the case m = 0,\nas we shall see later) to set one (or two) of the vector components to zero without\n9\n\n\fsetting the full electric field identically to zero, and thus it is not possible to\nreduce in a rigorous manner the vector problem into a scalar one.\nThe problem can in principle be solved by converting Eq. (17) from a condition in the cavity volume to a boundary condition which can then be treated on\nthe same footing as Eq. (16). One way of achieving this [12] is by noting that if\n~0 \u2261 E\n~\u22a5 + E\n~k\nE\n\n(19)\n\n~ \u2261 k2 \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 E\n~ 0 = k2 \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 E\n~\u22a5.\nE\n\n(20)\n\nfulfills Eq. (10), then so does\n\n~ to satisfy the boundThe latter is automatically divergence-free. In order for E\n~\n~\nary condition Et = 0, we require for E0\n\u0010 \u0011\n~0 = 0\n~ 0 = 0 and\u2207 * E\n(21)\nE\nt\n\non the surface. Then one has indeed\n\u0011\n\u0010\n~0\n~ t = k2 \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 E\nE\nt\n\u0010\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0011\n~ 0 + \u2207(\u2207 * E\n~ 0 ) = k2 E\n~ 0 = 0.\n= k2 E\nt\n\nt\n\n(22)\n\non the boundary. The problem is therefore reduced to finding the auxiliary field\n~ 0 and then deducing the transverse field from Eq. (21). This leads to a system\nE\n~ 0,\nof three second-order differential equations for each vector component of E\ngiven by Eq. (11), all of which are coupled by boundary conditions that are,\nhowever, quite complex.\nThe next step is then to write the field components as linear combinations\nof independent general solutions of Eq. (11) and determine the unknown coefficients in that expansion from the matching conditions at the boundary. The\nsolution proceeds in an analogous but much less tedious way if we neglect the additional divergence condition. The important simplification is that we are then\nable to consider the E+ and E\u2212 components of the electric field independently,\nby setting all except for one component to zero. The boundary conditions (16)\nare then decoupled as well. More precisely, it will be shown that the wave equations are then not only scalar but also separable, i.e., reducible to the solution\nof ordinary differential equations.\nWe therefore would like to neglect the coupling that results from the condition of zero divergence, provided that this can be justified in the context of the\npresent study. There are various reasons why this approximation will provide\nus with useful results. Foremost, it will turn out below that the most important\nmodes we find in this way in fact conspire to satisfy Eq. (17) a posteriori, cf.\nSection 3.5: the modes that provide the best confinement of the field in a tightly\nfocused region around the focal point are the ones with m = 0. For these, the\n10\n\n\fdifferent vector components decouple rigorously and the scalar program is exact.\nThese m = 0 modes are particularly significant because they provide the best\nconfinement of the field in a tight focal volume. This is the paramount aim of\nthe experimental dome structure.\nIn addition to this exact result, the more transparent simplified problem\nallows us to evaluate the stability of the stationary states of the field in the\nparabolic cavity with respect to deviations from the confocality condition \u2013 a\ndeformation that can readily occur in the course fabrication. This will be addressed with the help of the ray picture in Section 7, and the ray trajectories\nthemselves are independent of whether a vectorial or scalar field is considered.\nSince the exact nature of the deformation is unknown, it is necessary to make\nmodel assumptions and parametrize the deformation in some way. Although\nthe range of possible behaviors explored within our model can be argued to\nbe generic, we lose at that point the ability to predict accuratey all the individual modes of the specific sample. The error incurred by this fundamental\nuncertainty about the precise boundary shape is larger than the error made by\nadopting the simplified boundary conditions, and hence the latter are warranted\non physical grounds.\nThe consistency of these arguments is proven in Section 7 where we find\nthat the only modes which can in fact be reliably predicted for a large range\nof possible deformations (because they are structurally stable against the emergence of chaos) are the ones with low m (or angular momentum in the classical\npicture), concentrated strongly near the z-axis. For these modes one can set\napproximately m \u2248 0, E+ = E\u2212 and Ez = 0 so that Eq. (17) becomes valid.\n\n3.3\n\nThe wave equation in parabolic coordinates\n\nHaving discussed the boundary conditions, we now provide the solutions to Eq.\n(15). In order to find a system of general solutions to the formally scalar differential equations, Eqs. (11 c) or (15), we express the scalar Laplacian appearing\nthere in parabolic coordinates (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c6), leading to the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n4\n\u2202Q\n\u2202\n\u2202Q\nn2\n\u2202\n\u03be*\n+\n\u03b7*\n+ k2 Q =\n*\n*Q\n(23)\n\u03be+\u03b7\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u03be\u03b7\nwhere\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 n=m+1\nn=m\u22121\n\uf8f3\nn=m\n\nf or\nf or\nf or\n\nQ = E+\nQ = E\u2212\nQ = Ez\n\n(24)\n\nHere we have used the fact that the derivative \u2202 2 /\u2202\u03c62 appearing in the Laplacian\n\u22072 pulls down a factor \u2212m2 due to the ansatz Eq. (12). Although the righthand\nside is the analog of the centrifugal barrier in cylindrical problems, it thus\ndepends not on angular momentum m directly but on a modified azimuthal\nmode number n. This occurs due to the additional \u03c6 derivatives introduced\n11\n\n\fwhen we transformed the vector field components to cylindrical coordinates in\nEq. (11).\nAt this point we introduce the approximation of discarding the divergence\ncondition so that we merely have to consider the boundary conditions (16) with\none and only one of the three field components nonzero. Then, Eq. (23) is\nseparable in \u03b7 and \u03be. We shall return to the details of the solution procedure\nin Section 4; for now it is sufficient to give the result: Denoting the separation\nconstant by \u03b2, the solution can be written in the form\nQ = F (k, \u03b2, \u03be) * F (k, \u2212\u03b2, \u03b7)\n\n(25)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn2 /4 k 2\n\u03beF \u2032\u2032 + F \u2032 + \u2212\n+ \u03be+\u03b2 F =0\n\u03be\n4\n\n(26)\n\nwhere F (k, \u03b2, \u03be) obeys\n\nThe functions F (k, \u03b2, \u03be) and F (k, \u2212\u03b2, \u03b7) appearing here are solutions of this\ndifferential equation with the same k and n, but with sign-reversed \u03b2, and hence\ntheir functional dependence on \u03be and \u03b7 will be different unless \u03b2 = 0. Without\nloss of generality, we can assume n to be nonnegative, because it appears in the\nabove equation only as n2 . The solutions that do not diverge at \u03be = 0 are of\nthe form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\n+\n1\ni\u03b2\nik\u03be/2 n\n\u2212 ; n + 1; \u2212ik\u03be\n(27)\nF (k, \u03b2, \u03be) = e\n\u03be2M\n2\nk\nwhere M (a, b, z) is Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function. The function\nF as written here is in fact real, because of the Kummer transformation [13]\nb\nb\nM ( \u2212 a, b, \u2212z) = e\u2212z M ( + a, b, z),\n2\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere we set a = i\u03b2/k, b = n + 1 and z = ik\u03be. Appplying the theorem then\nyields F (k, \u03b2, \u03be) = F (k, \u03b2, \u03be)\u2217 .\nThe separation constant \u03b2 and the wavenumber k at which to find the mode\nare still unknowns of the problem that have to be determined from the boundary\nconditions. The first constraint we can write down is\nF (k, \u03b2, 2 f ) \u2261 0\n\n(29)\n\nto enforce vanishing tangential field on the parabolic surface. In the twodimensional plane spanned by the unknowns \u03b2 and k, this single equation defines\na set of curves. The boundary condition on the focal plane requires that E\u00b1\nbe symmetric under reflection, i.e., invariant under \u03be \u2194 \u03b7. For Ez , on the\nother hand, one needs odd parity. In order to construct such solutions with a\nwell-defined parity, we have to form linear combinations\nE = F (k, \u03b2, \u03be) F (k, \u2212\u03b2, \u03b7) \u00b1 F (k, \u2212\u03b2, \u03be) F (k, \u03b2, \u03b7),\n12\n\n(30)\n\n\fwhere in addition\nF (k, \u2212\u03b2, 2 f ) \u2261 0.\n\n(31)\n\nThe set of curves parametrized by this constraint will intersect the curves defined\nby Eq. (29) at certain isolated points in the \u03b2 - k plane. By finding these\nintersection points, we determine the quantized values of \u03b2 and k corresponding\nto solutions of Eq. (23) which satisfy the boundary conditions. It is not clear\nat this stage of the discussion how many intersections there are, or even how\nthe curves defined by each equation separately will look. Before we analyze\nthe different branches of these equations and identify their intersections based\non asymptotic methods in Section 4, it is useful to discuss in more detail the\nconsistency of the fields thus obtained.\n\n3.4\n\nBehavior at the focal point\n\nThe main experimental purpose of the cavity is to concentrate the field near\nthe focus as much as possible. Since one always has Ez = 0 there, it remains\nto discuss the behavior of E\u00b1 in the focal region. Because of the \"angularmomentum-barrier\" on the righthand side of Eq. (23), the solutions F given in\nEq. (27) attain a factor \u03be n/2 which suppresses the field near the origin \u03be = 0\nwhen n 6= 0. The Kummer function itself goes to M = 1 at \u03be = 0, so that\nthe only way of getting a nonvanishing field at the origin is to set n = 0 in\nEq. (26). This means that the angular momentum quantum number must in\nfact satisfy m = 1 for E\u2212 or m = \u22121 for E+ according to Eq. (24). But this\nleads to a contradiction: if the field is nonzero at the origin, then because of\nthe azimuthal factor exp(\u00b1i\u03c6) one faces a singularity at \u03be = \u03b7 = 0 in which the\nfield is indeterminate. Therefore, there is no possibility to obtain a nonzero field\nprecisely at the focus of the cavity.\nFor m = \u00b11 there are still solutions of Eq. (23), but they must involve\nsolutions of Eq. (23) in suitable linear combinations such as to yield a vanishing\nfield at \u03be = \u03b7 = 0. We have the freedom to linearly combine eigenstates of\nthe wave equation at the same wavenumber k (yielding a stationary state with\nmonochromatic time dependence). First we use the real-valued solutions in Eq.\n(27) to form a superposition of the type Eq. (30) with a plus sign. Despite its\nsymmetry it can also be made to vanish at \u03be = \u03b7 = 0, if one or both of the\nfunctions F (k, \u03b2, \u03be) and F (k, \u2212\u03b2, \u03b7) are zero at the origin.\nAlthough we can hence find solutions for arbitrary m with a tangential electric field that is symmetric under reflection at the focal plane, we can only\nattempt to concentrate the field near the focus, always with a node at the focal\npoint, dictated for m 6= 0 by the phase singularity at the origin. For m = 0, there\nis the residual angular momentum barrier due to n 6= 0, and thus even in this\nsimple case \u2013 contrary to our expectation from quantum mechanical analogues\n\u2013 the \"s-wave\" solutions have vanishing field at the focus, as a consequence of\nthe vector nature of the field.\n\n13\n\n\f3.5\n\nParticular case: the fundamental s-wave\n\nThe case m = 0 can be discussed in more detail because it permits simple\nanalytical expressions for the wave solution, if we specialize further to \u03b2 = 0.\nIn this case, the solutions in Eq. (27) simplify to\nn i\nF (k, 0, \u03be) \u221d I( , k\u03be) in/2 ,\n2 2\n\n(32)\n\ndropping prefactors that are absorbed in the normalization. Here, I is the\nmodified Bessel function.\nAs was already noted below Eq. (15), E\u00b1 linearly dependent in the special\ncase m = 0, so that\n\u221a we can in particular choose E+ = E\u2212 . Then E\u03c1 = 0 and\nE+ = E\u2212 = E\u03c6 / 2. We thus obtain the TE field by setting\nE\u03c6 = Q = F (k, 0, \u03be) F (k, 0, \u03b7)\n\n(33)\n\nas in Eq. (25). This already satisfies the condition of symmetry with respect\nto the focal plane, without having to form a superposition of the type (30).\nMoreover, it satisfies the condition of vanishing divergence, as can be checked\nwith Eq. (17).\nWith n = 1 (for E+ at m = 0), Eq.

(34).\n\nand the corresponding magnetic field is\n\uf8f1\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u01eb\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 B\u03c1 = iE0 * \u221ak * r\u03c1 (z sin(kr) \u2212 r sin(kz))\n\u03bc\u01eb\n~\nsin(kr)\nB=\nBz = iE0 * k\nr\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nB\u03c6 = 0\n\n(38)\n\nBy splitting the various terms appearing here into two contributions, the electromagnetic field can then be considered as the superposition of two fields:\nThe first field is polarized along E\u03c6 and B\u03c1 and can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates as\n(1)\n\nE\u03c6 =\n\nE0\n\u221a E0\ncos(kN z) and B\u03c1(1) = i \u03bc\u01eb\nsin(kN z)\nkN \u03c1\nkN \u03c1\n\n(39)\n\nThe second field is polarized in spherical coordinates (r, \u03c6, \u03b8) along the directions of the azimuthal and polar angles, \u03c6 and \u03b8, according to\n(2)\n\nE\u03c6 =\n\nE0 cos(kN r)\nsin \u03b8 kN r\n\n(2)\n\nand B\u03b8\n\n\u221a E0 sin(kN r)\n= i \u03bc\u01eb\nsin \u03b8 kN r\n\n(40)\n\nHere, we have used the substitution \u03c1 = r sin \u03b8 in the denominators.\nThe first field, Eq. (39), corresponds to cylindrical standing waves with a\nphase variation along the z direction, while the second field, Eq. (40), corresponds to spherical standing waves with a phase variation along the radial\ndirection. This configuration is reminiscent of what is expected from a simple\ngeometrical optics argument in which a ray bundle emerging from the focal point\ncan propagate outwards as a spherical wave, upon reflection on the parabola it\ngets converted into a cylindrical wave, which in turn can counter-propagate back\nto the focal point after being reflected on the planar mirror and a second time\non the parabola. In the unfolded double-paraboloid, the ray trajectories are of\nthe type shown in Fig. 4. It should be noted that these two partial waves are\nnot physical when taken individually, because in both cases the electric field\ndiverges along the axis of the parabola. The divergence, however, cancels out\nwhen the superposition of the two partial waves is considered. We have so far\nonly drawn this ray interpretation from a particular decomposition of the exact\n15\n\n\fsolution; the question is how arbitrary that decomposition is and what we can\nlearn from it. This will be pursued in the following section. The actual intensity\ndistribution of these n = 1 states in the cavity will be plotted in Section 5.2\nwhere we can compare their spatial patterns with those obtained for larger n,\nin order to justify our claim that the s-wave modes provide the best focussing.\n\n4\n\nFinding the modes within the short-wavelength\napproximation\n\nHaving seen that even the long-wavenlength s-wave in our cavity can be interpreted as standing waves arising from counterpropagating ray bundles and their\naccompanying wavefronts, we now turn to a more quantitative eikonal analysis.\nSuch an analysis can provide accurate starting points for a numerical search of\nthe exact wave solutions, which are determined by finding intersection points\nbetween the families of curves (29) and (31) in the plane of \u03b2 vs. k. Such\nsemiclassical considerations based on the short-wavelength approximation are\nan important first step because there are, as we shall see, infinitely many intesections between the sets of curves determining the exact solutions, and one\ndesires a means of finding them in a systematic way, labeling them by \"quantum\nnumbers\", giving the number of nodes in the field along the coordinate lines for\n\u03be and \u03b7. Beyond this very practical use of the short-wavelength limit, we also\nwant to establish a physical understanding of the resonator modes that allows\nus to predict how they depend on changes in the cavity shape. This aspect of\nthe ray picture will be expounded in the last section.\n\n4.1\n\nWKB approximation and effective potential\n\nThe equation to be solved is Eq. (26), an ordinary second-order differential\nequation, where the angular momentum m enters as a parameter trough the\nconstant n. We are looking for solutions F (\u03be) which satisfy the boundary condition F (2 f ) = 0 and are not singular at \u03be = 0. The standard short-wavelength\napproach to be employed here is the WKB approximation[14]. After division\nby \u03be, Eq. (26) takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4\u03b2\n1 df\n1\nn2\nd2 f\n2\nk +\n(41)\n+\n+\n\u2212 2 f (\u03be) = 0.\nd\u03be 2\n\u03be d\u03be\n4\n\u03be\n\u03be\nFor the subsequent analysis it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless coordinate\np\n(42)\nu = k \u03be.\nDividing Eq. (41) by k 2 and defining a rescaled separation constant\nZ\u2261\n\n4\u03b2\n,\nk\n\n16\n\n(43)\n\n\fFigure 5: Solid curve: the effective potential V (u) for n = 3, showing the\nclassical turning points u0 (v0 ) where Z (\u2212Z) intersects the effective potential\nV , cf. the dashed lines. The ranges of classically allowed motion for the two\ndegrees of freedom u and v with energies Z and \u2212Z are indicated \u221a\nby the shaded\nbars (dark for u, light for v). The outer turning points at u, v = 2kf act as a\nhard wall whose position depends on k.\nthe following equation is obtained:\nd2 f\n1 df\n1\n\u2212 2 \u2212\n+\ndu\nu du 4\n\n\u0012\n\nn2\n\u2212 u2\nu2\n\n\u0013\n\nf (u) = Z f (u).\n\n(44)\n\nThis has a form similar to the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation of quantum mechanics, except for the first u-derivative which makes the kinetic energy\noperator non-selfadjoint. This term appears in the radial equation of cylindrically symmetric problems but does not affect the applicability of the WKB\napproximation [15].\nThe WKB solution requires us to find the classical turning points in the\npotential appearing in this equation, with Z playing the role of the total energy.\nThis effective potential,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 n2\n2\n,\n(45)\n\u2212\nu\nV (u) =\n4 u2\nis a superposition of an inverted parabola and the centrifugal potential determined by n, giving rise to the solid line in Fig. 5. Using this together with the\nansatz\nR\np\n1 i p(u) du\n(46)\ne\n, p(u) = Z \u2212 V (u),\nf (u) \u2248\np(u)\nthe approximate solutions are found by imposing the boundary conditions at\nthe turning points.\nThere is only one possible turning point corresponding to the closest approach to the origin u = 0, which is given by\nsr\nZ2\nZ\nV (u0 ) = Z \u21d2 u0 =\nn2 +\n\u2212 .\n(47)\n4\n2\nIf Z > 0 and n = 0, then no inner turning point exists. This inner turning point,\nin classical mechanics, is the point where the momentum in the x-direction\n17\n\n\fsmoothly goes through zero as it changes sign, and hence the probability per\nunit time of finding the particle becomes infinite. In the ray dynamics, this\nphenomenon gives rise to a caustic. This will be discussed further in Section 6.\nThe outer turning point of this classical picture is determined by the Dirichlet\nboundary condition at the parabolic mirror, which in the new coordinate is\nlocated at\np\n\u03be1 = 2 f \u21d2 u1 = 2 kf.\n(48)\n\u221a\nIt is the boundary condition f (u1 ) = f ( 2 kf ) = 0 in which the short-wavelength\ncondition is contained: we assume that at the outer boundary the wavefunction\nhas the WKB form, Eq. (46), which requires that the dimensionless size parameter satisfies\nx \u2261 2 kf \u226b 1,\n(49)\ni.e. this additional boundary is far away from the classical turning point u0 of\nthe effective potential. All steps discussed above for f (\u03be) apply analogously to\nthe variable \u03b7 appearing in the product ansatz Q, Eq. (25), if we reverse the\nsign of Z everywhere and replace u by the variable\np\nv = k\u03b7.\n(50)\nThen the inner turning point v0 for this second degree of freedom is obtained\nas\nsr\nZ2\nZ\n+ .\n(51)\nn2 +\nV (v0 ) = \u2212Z \u21d2 v0 =\n4\n2\nThe values of u0 and v0 determine the distance of closest approach to the z axis\n\n4.2\n\nQuantization conditions\n\nUnder this condition, the semiclassical determination of the eigenfrequencies\nproceeds by applying the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization to the action integral\nfor one period of the motion in the effective potential. One round trip consists\nof the path from u0 to u1 and back to u0 . The quantized action is therefore\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZu1 p\n3\nJ(Z, x; n, \u03bd) \u2261 2\nZ \u2212 V (u) du \u2261 2\u03c0 \u03bd +\n.\n4\n\n(52)\n\nu0\n\nThe integer \u03bd = 0, 1 . . . is the number of nodes of the wavefunction in the\npotential, and the constant 3/4 takes into account the phase shifts of \u03c0 and\n\u03c0/2, at the outer and inner turning points, respectively. In other words, the\nabove quantization condition is an approximate way of writing the phase-shift\nrequirements that hold at boundaries and caustics, using the approximation that\nthe wave propagation itself is described by a wavefront whose phase advance in\nx is given by the function J.\n18\n\n\fThe result of the integration is found to be\np\nx2 + Z x \u2212 n2\nJ(Z, x; n, \u03bd) =\n\u221a\nx2 + Z x \u2212 n2 + x + Z/2\nZ\np\n+ ln\n2\nn2 + Z 2 /4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0\nZ x \u2212 2n2\n+\n\u2212n arcsin \u221a\n2\nx Z 2 + 4n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n.\n= 2\u03c0 \u03bd +\n4\n\n(53)\n\nThis is an equation for the two unknowns Z and x, i.e. for the rescaled separation\nconstant and size parameter. It is therefore analogous to Eq. (29). The integer\n\u03bd uniquely labels all the allowed solutions f\u03bd of Eq. (44). This is an important\ndifference to Eq. (29): there, the function F in fact has infinitely many branches\nthat satisfy the equation, which are however not labeled explicitly. The great\nadvantage of Eq. (53) is that these branches are explicitly enumerated by \u03bd, so\nthat fixing this index selects exactly one curve in the Z-x plane instead of an\ninfinte family.\nAs in Eq. (25), the field consists of products of the form\nQ = f\u03bd (x, Z, u) f\u03bc (x, \u2212Z, v)\n\n(54)\n\nwith v defined as in Eq. (50). The two function f\u03bd and f\u03bc have their analog in\nthe exact solutions F of Eq. (26), corresponding to the branches of F labeled\nby \u03bd and \u03bc, respectively.\nWe then form combinations the form of Eq. (30) to enforce the required\nsymmetry with respect to the focal plane. The semiclassical WKB quantization\nfor the function f\u03bc (x, \u2212Z, v) provides a second equation of the form (53),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n.\n(55)\nJ(\u2212Z, x; n, \u03bc) = 2 \u03c0 \u03bc +\n4\nThese two quantization conditions play the same role as Eqs. (29) and (31): the\nintersections of the curves parametrized by them determine the quantized values\nof Z and x. However, the WKB method affords a great simplification: by fixing\nthe branches \u03bd and \u03bc, the intersection of the two resulting curves is uniquely\ndetermined. To illustrate this situation, we show in Fig. 6 how the lines defined\nby the above two equations traverse the Z-x plane. Only a small portion of this\nplane is shown, emphasizing the behavior of the semiclassical results at small\nx where their accuracy should be at a minimum. Comparison with the exact\nfamilies of curves shows, however, that the WKB results are excellent even in this\nlong-wavelength limit. Note that by symmetry, intersections occurring at Z = 0\nare always between curves with the same branch index \u03bd = \u03bc. All curves shift\nto larger x with increasing n because of the larger centrifugal barrier, pushing\nthe classically allowed regions of the effective potential in Fig. 5 outward.\n19\n\n\fFigure 6: For the first six values of n, the graphical solution of the simultaneous\nequations (53) and (55) can be read off from the intersections of the red curves.\nThe dashed black curves show the analogous graphical solution of Eqs. (29) and\n(31). The exact and semiclassical curves are almost indistinguishable (except\nfor n = 0), attesting to the striking accuracy of the former even at the smallest\npossible size parameters x. All plots can be continued to Z > 0 by reflecting at\nthe axis Z = 0. The WKB curves with positive slope belong to Eq. (55), the\nfalling lines are created by Eq. (53). They are labeled starting from the leftmost\nby \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2 . . ..\n\n20\n\n\fFigure 7: Four states with n = 1. Grayscale indicates the magnitude of the\nelectric field for the modes (E\u00b1 ) of the confocal double paraboloid, highest fields\nshown in black. The vertical axis is z, the horizontal axis the axial distance \u03c1.\nIncreasing x means shorter wavelength and hence more nodal lines (white). The\nsize parameter is quantized according to Eq. (56) with N = 1, 2 in the top row,\nand N = 7, 14 at the bottom.\n\n5\n\nExact solution for the modes and their field\ndistribution\n\nOnce the allowed combinations of Z and x \u2013 or equivalently \u03b2 and k \u2013 at which\nthe boundary conditions are satisfied have been found, the problem of finding\nthe modes is solved. For example, we can now plot the intensity distribution of\neach mode by using the quantized values of \u03b2 and k in Eq. (27) and forming\nthe proper linear combinations of the form Eq. (30).\n\n5.1\n\nMode profiles\n\nThis will now be carried out for the lowest-lying modes as obtained from the\nintersections in Fig. 6. Any given value of n can have a different meaning for\nthe intensity distribution in the azimuthal direction, depending on which case\nin Eq. (24) we choose to consider: n = m\u00b1 1 for the modes. Since the azimuthal\nfield variation is trivial, \u221d exp(im\u03c6), we wish to restrict our attention to the\nmode profile in the plane spanned by \u03c1 and z in cylindrical coordinates. The\nvariable governing this property is n, not m. Therefore, n is used here to classify\nthe mode profiles.\nAs has been done in the previous sections, we shall take the focal plane to\nbe the symmetry plane of a double paraboloid, and plot the wave fields in this\nunfolded cavity. This is done in view of the subsequent discussion, where we\nshall establish the connection between these modes and the ray dynamics. Some\nwave plots are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Note that the case n = 0 does not appear\namong the solutions listed here because it corresponds to wave fields that do\nnot vanish on the z-axis and hence are irreconcilable with the finite angular\nmomentum m = \u00b11, as discussed in section 3.4).\nIf we look at only the left column of Figs. 7 and 8, it is apparent that all\n21\n\n\fFigure 8: The modes shown here do not follow the simple law of Eq. (56) but\nwere obtained numerically. With increasing centrifugal barrier, labeled by n,\nthe forbidden region around the z-axis grows outward.\nstates with Z = 0 look similar, as do all states with Z 6= 0. A similar observation\ncan be made in the right columns of the figures. Comparison to the intersecting\nlines in the graphical solution, Fig. 6, shows that states with the same nodal\npattern indeed result from the crossing of the same pair of lines \u2013 labeled by\nthe same \u03bc and \u03bd, only for different n which pushes the intersecting lines to\nhigher x. However, the interpretation of \u03bc, \u03bd as the number of nodes in the\nparabolic coordinate directions cannot be carried through in all of the plots.\nWe will return to this problem in Section 5.3.\nIn order to achieve the best possible concentration of fields near the focus,\nthe most promising candidates are the modes with n = 1. Among these, the\npatterns shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the states at Z = 0 in turn show the\nhighest intensity near the focal plane. These are precisely the fundamental swaves we discussed in Section 3.5, with the wavenumbers quantized according\nto Eq. (36), which for the size parameter reads\nxN = 2 kn f = 2 \u03c0 N.\n\n(56)\n\nThis is an exact result which can be compared to the WKB quantization condition in Eq. (53) with Z = 0, n = 1. The latter actually has a more complicated\nform,\np\n1\nx2 \u2212 1 + arcsin = 2\u03c0 (\u03bd + 1),\n(57)\nx\n22\n\n\fbut to second order in the small quantity 1/x this is identical to Eq. (56) with\nN = \u03bd + 1. This confirms the observation made in Fig. 6 that the numerical agreement between exact and semiclassical solutions is good even for small\nquantum numbers.\n\n5.2\n\nFocussing and the effective mode volume\n\nIn order to evaluate the field enhancement that is achieved in the fundamental\nTE modes discussed in Section 3.5 and shown in Fig. 7, it is necessary to examine\nthe distribution of the electromagnetic energy in that mode. The energy in a\nparabolic cavity of focal length f is\nU\n\n1\n=\n4\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n\u03be=2f\n\n\u03be=0\n\nZ\n\n\u03b7=2f\n\n\u03b7=0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6=2\u03c0\n\n\u03c6=0\n\n\u0013\n\u01eb\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(|E\u03be | + |E\u03b7 | + |E\u03c6 | ) +\n(|B\u03be | + |B\u03b7 | + |B\u03c6 | )\n2\n2\u03bc\n\u03be+\u03b7\nd\u03be d\u03b7 d\u03c6\n4\n\n(58)\n\nwhich gives, for the fundamental (s-wave) TE modes, Eq. (34),\nU = \u01ebE02\n\n\u03c0f\n4k 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nkf\n\nsin2 (x)\ndx\nx\n\n(59)\n\nwhere the value of the integral can be evaluated numerically.\nFor the experimentally realized cavity described in Section 1, kf = 14 \u03c0\nso that the value of the integral is 2.527. The intensity distribution for this\nmode is shown at the bottom right of Fig. 7 (note x = 2 kf ). To examine the\nenergy distribution in the cavity, we can evaluate the energy that is contained\nat each lobe of the standing wave of parabolic wavefront that corresponds to the\nmode. We note then that the first lobe, corresponding to a parabolic wavefront\nof focal length f1 = \u03bb/2, contains 48% of the total energy; to see this, replace\nthe integration limit in Eq. (59) by \u03c0. This lobe occupies a physical volume of\nV0 \u2261 \u03c0\u03bb3 /4 whereas the volume of the overall cavity, V = 2\u03c0 f 3 , is 2744 times\nlarger.\nThis underscores the very large confinement of the field that occurs in the\nvicinity of the focal point and points to the possibility of observing a very large\nenhancement of spontaneous emission into this mode. The fraction of the total\nenergy contained in the first lobe of course reaches 100% if the smallest possible\ncavity with k f = \u03c0 is considered. However, the size achieved in our present\nsample already approaches the optimal conditions if one takes into account that\nenhancement of spontaneous emission requires not only a small effective mode\nvolume but most of all a small local density of states [16]. The average density\nof modes in an arbitrarily-shaped electromagnetic resonator of volume V is a\n23\n\n\ffundamental quantity in the theory of blackbody radiation and was derived by\nH. Weyl [19]:\nk2\n(60)\n\u03c1Weyl (k) \u2248 2 V.\n\u03c0\nNote that this can also be written in the physically intuitive form\n\u0012 \u0013\n2\nV\nd\n\u03c1Weyl(k) \u2248 \u03c0 2\n,\n(61)\n3 dk V0\nindicating that the number of modes in the interval dk is proportional to the\nnumber of additional volume quanta V0 that fit into the given volume V when\nk increases to k + dk. The local density of states in the focal volume V0 can\ntherefore be interpreted to be the same as the total density of states in a small\ncavity of volume V = V0 . This, in turn, is roughly the effective mode volume\nfor the fundamental s-wave in our structure. \u00bfFrom this we conclude that the\nspontaneous emission enhancement should be close to the maximum possible\nvalue even though our cavity is not of the minimum possible size. This is one\nof the central advantages we were looking for in the parabolic cavity design. In\nthis discussion we have assumed for simplicity that the Q-factor of the modes\nunder consideration is fixed, independent of size and quantum numbers. This\nsevere simplification will be removed in Section 8.\nIn the higher order modes with m > 0, the centrifugal barrier prevents the\nfield from approaching the focal point. This implies that these modes will\nhave a larger effective volume and, correspondingly, a smaller enhancement\nof the spontaneous emission rate. An added difficulty concerning the higher\norder modes arises from the limited experimental control over the exact cavity\nshape. As discussed in Section 7, small deformations of the cavity (modeled as\ndeviations from confocality), result in chaos, leading to a loss of constraints on\nthe possible regions of phase space which can be explored. This further increases\nthe effective volume of these modes. The enhanced spontaneous emission into\nthe fundamental s-wave implies that this mode will also exhibit a large gain\nand, correspondingly, a low lasing threshold. The preliminary conclusion of this\nsection is therefore that a mode with low angular momentum and small Z (or\n\u03b2) will be the dominant mode in a laser of parabolic geometry.\n\n5.3\n\nCaustic structure in the wave solutions\n\nIn order to arrive at the solutions shown in Fig. 8, we started from the semiclassical (short-wavelength) approximation and then refined the quantized Z\nand k further by applying the exact modal conditions. However, the question\narises how the quantum numbers \u03bc and \u03bd which label the semiclassical solutions\ncan be visualized in Fig. 8. The answer is that the symmetrization procedure\nobscures this identification. What happens can be understood if we ignore the\nparity requirement and plot the wave fields in the simple product form of Eq.\n(25).\n24\n\n\fFigure 9: Mode intensities as in Fig. 8, but without performing the symmetrization prescribed by the focal plane boundary condition. The WKB quantum\nnumbers \u03bc (and \u03bd) can be read off by counting the number of wavefunction\nnodes parallel (and perpendicular) to the reference line \u03b3. Modes in the first\nthree rows correspond to the symmetrized versions of Fig. 8. In order to illustrate the approach to the short-wavelength limit, additional modes are shown for\nwhich the formation of caustics is apparent in the high-intensity ridges (black)\nbordering the classically forbidden regions (white).\nThe symmetrization performed according to Eq. (30) with A = B introduces no change whatsoever if the separation constant is \u03b2 = 0. Therefore, the\nintensity profiles of all modes with Z = 0 in Fig. 8 are the same before and\nafter symmetrization. However, the wave patterns acquire a qualitatively different and simpler form if we desymmetrize the remaining states. This is shown in\nFig. 9. The nodal patterns now appear in a regular fashion along the coordinate\nlines for u and v (or \u03be and \u03b7), and their number along these lines is uniquely\ndetermined by \u03bc and \u03bd.\nBy symmetrizing a state such as the one shown for n = 3, k = 18.59 and\nZ = \u22122.54 in Fig. 9, the field shown in the desymmetrized plot is added to\nits reflection at the focal plane, thus allowing some nodal lines to be \"filled\nin\", as seen in the corresponding state at the bottom right of Fig. 8. The\ndesymmetrized waves in Fig. 9 exhibit nodal lines precisely along lines of \u03b7 =\nconst or \u03be = const. In addition to the simple nodal structure, we also observe a\nclear segregation between regions of negligible intensity and regions of oscillatory\nfield, with dividing lines between them that become more and more pronounced\n\n25\n\n\fas the size parameter x = 2 k f increases. These are the caustics, which in fact\naccumulate an increasing amount of intensity as the short-wavelength limit is\napproached. The caustics follow parabolic coordinate lines as well, as is apparent\nfrom the last row of Fig. 9. The field at n = 3, x = 34.16, Z = \u22128.72 is bounded\nfrom below by a broad inverted parabola, and excluded from the z-axis by a\nsteep upright parabola. The intersection of both parabolas forms the caustic. In\nthe mode at n = 4, x = 73.73, Z = 0, both the upright and inverted bounding\nparabolas are symmetric as we expect for Z = 0.\n\n6\n\nCaustic structure in the ray picture\n\nIn this section we will elaborate on the relation between mode structure and ray\ndynamics, as a basis on which we can predict the effect of shape perturbations\non the mode structure. The caustic patterns revealed in the last section by the\ndecomposition into the product states as in Eq. (25) is a direct consequence of\nthe classical turning points in the effective potential V , Eq. (45), for the motion\nalong the \u03be and \u03b7 directions. The distinction between classically allowed and\nforbidden regions gives rise to the regions of oscillatory and vanishing fields in\nFig. 9. The effective potential has, so far, been discussed only as an auxiliary\nconcept that proved convenient in the WKB treatment; its relation to the behavior of the rays of geometric optics is, however, well-known. For the sake of a\nself-contained presentation, we convey here the idea behind the general eikonal\ntheory by showing how to derive ray equations from the one-dimensional separated wave equations, Eq. (26). The argument is non-standard in the sense that\nEq. (26) is based on the full vectorial wave equation (i.e. with polarization),\nand we therefore shall find that for a given angular momentum m, slightly different ray trajectories have to be considered depending on polarization. This is\nbecause the quantity entering Eq. (26) is n, not m.\n\n6.1\n\nRay equations from the WKB approximation\n\nInserting the WKB ansatz, Eq. (46), into the wave equation for the separated\nvariables, Eq. (26), one finds to leading semiclassical order that p must satisfy\nthe equation\np2u + V (u) = Z, similarly p2v + V (v) = \u2212Z.\n(62)\n\nWe can interpret this as the Hamiltonians of two decoupled linear systems, and\nadd them to obtain the Hamiltonian for the combined system,\nH\u0303 = p2u + p2v + V (u) + V (v)\n\n(63)\n\nThe trajectories we are looking for then satisfy the equation H\u0303(pu , pv , u, v) =\nZ \u2212 Z = 0, or written out:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn2\n1 n2\n2\n2\n= 0.\n(64)\n+\n\u2212\nu\n\u2212\nv\np2u + p2v +\n4 u2\nv2\n26\n\n\fIf we divide this by (u2 + v 2 ), the result is\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nn\n1\np2u + p2v\n+\n\u2212 1 = 0.\nu2 + v 2\n4 u2 v 2\n\n(65)\n\nthis can also be interpreted as arising from a new Hamiltonian\nH\u2261\n\np2u + p2v\n1 n2\n+\n2\n2\nu +v\n4 u2 v 2\n\n(66)\n\nby requiring\n\n1\n.\n(67)\n4\nThe Hamiltonian in this form is analogous to the wave equation in parabolic\ncoordinates, Eq. (23), where the Laplacian is divided by the same scale factor\n(u2 + v 2 ) that accompanies the conjugate momenta here. One can now use\nHamilton's equation of motion to replace momenta by \"velocities\", the definition\nbeing\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\nu\u0307 =\n, v\u0307 =\n.\n(68)\n\u2202pu\n\u2202pv\nH(pu , pv , u, v) =\n\nThis leads to the substitution\npu =\n\n1\n1 2\n(u + v 2 ) u\u0307, pv = (u2 + v 2 ) v\u0307,\n2\n2\n\n(69)\n\nwhich brings Eq.

(3) and (42). To examine\nwhat this equation has to do with the ray dynamics, we take the ray-picture\npoint of view now.\n\n6.2\n\nGeometric optics in cylindrical coordinates\n\nIf we consider the three-dimensional motion of rays in a double paraboloid of the\nshape in Fig. 3 (b), their propagation between reflections at the parabolic walls\nwill of course follow straight lines, and hence there is no place for any coordinatedependent potential V . However, in order to compare the ray dynamics to\nwavefunction plots in the z-\u03c1 plane as shown in Fig. 9, we must project the\nray motion onto this plane as well. In the wave analysis, this projection was\n27\n\n\fachieved by using the rotational symmetry of the cavity around the z axis to\neliminate the azimuthal coordinate \u03c6 from the problem in favor of the angular\nmomentum quantum number m.\nIn ray optics, we can do the same: rays can be classified by an angular\nmomentum Lz because of the axial symmetry. To see this, we first define Lz .\nA ray trajectory is a curve consisting of straight line segments between each\nreflection. If we parametrize this curve as r(l), where l is the path length along\nthe ray from some arbitrary starting point, then |\u1e59(l)| = 1. Here and in the\nfollowing, the dot represents the differentiation with respect to arc length, d/dl.\nIn cylinder coordinates \u03c1, \u03c6, z, we can decompose this as\n\u1e59 = \u03c1\u0307 e\u03c1 + \u017c ez + r \u03c6\u0307 e\u03c6 .\n\n(72)\n\nBetween any two reflections, this is a constant unit vector in the direction of\nthe ray. With this, the equation for a straight line segment can be written in\ngeneral as\nr \u00d7 \u1e59 \u2261 L,\n(73)\nwhere L is a constant analogous to the angular momentum of classical mechanics.\nBecause of the rotational symmetry around the z-axis, the azimuthal unit\nvector e\u03c6 at the point of reflection is always tangent to the surface. Therefore, a\nreflection does not change the component of \u1e59 along e\u03c6 , so that \u03c1 \u03c6\u0307 is continuous.\nSince the ray curve is itself continuous everywhere, so is \u03c1(l). Hence the quantity\nLz \u2261 \u03c12 \u03c6\u0307\n\n(74)\n\nis also continuous at each reflection. But this is just the z-component of L in\nEq. (73), as can be verified by performing the cross product there. Thus, Lz is a\nconstant between reflections, which together with its overall continuity implies\nthat it is a conserved quantity for the whole ray trajectory.\nUsing Eq. (74), the fact that \u1e59 is a unit vector, Eq. (72), can be recast as\n\u03c1\u03072 + \u017c 2 +\n\nL2z\n= 1.\n\u03c12\n\n(75)\n\n\u00bfFrom the ray approach we have thus obtained an equation almost identical\nto Eq. (71). We only have to re-define the path length variable l to make it\ndimensionless, by introducing\ns = k l,\n(76)\nto obtain for the derivatives\n\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\n=k ,\ndl\nds\n\nand interpret furthermore\nLz =\n28\n\nn\n.\nk\n\n(77)\n(78)\n\n\fThen Eqs. (71) and (75) become identical, if we interpret the dot in Eq. (71)\nto mean d/ds. The scale factor of the \"time\" variable parametrizing our trajectories is irrelevant for the shape of the paths, so that we can conclude that the\nray picture introduced here is equivalent to the motion described by the WKB\neffective potential, with the important identification of Eq. (78).\nBesides Eq. (75), the only other equation that is needed to completely determine any ray trajectory from its initial conditions is the law of specular\nreflection, which can be formulated with the help of the outward normal unit\nvector u at the reflection point as\n\u1e59ref lected = \u1e59 \u2212 2 u (u * \u1e59).\n\n(79)\n\nThis corresponds to a reversal of the normal component of \u1e59. Here we can\nsee explicitly that reflections do not affect the component of \u1e59 in the direction\nof e\u03c6 , since the normal u has no e\u03c6 -component as a consequence of the axial\nsymmetry.\nThis latter fact also means that we can simply drop the e\u03c6 -component from\nEq. (79) altogether. Therefore, we now define the two-component vectors in\nthe z - \u03c1 plane by dropping the e\u03c6 -components from the corresponding threecomponent vectors. Thus, \u1e59 becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1\u0307\nv \u2261 \u03c1\u0307 e\u03c1 + \u017c ez \u2261\n,\n(80)\n\u017c\nand similarly\nu = u \u03c1 e\u03c1 + u z ez .\n\n(81)\n\nIn this two-dimensional space, the specular-reflection condition retains the form\nof Eq. (79),\nvref lected = v \u2212 2 u (u * v).\n(82)\nThis is the reason why we can call the motion in the z - \u03c1 plane a billiard\nproblem.\n\n6.3\n\nCurved ray paths in the centrifugal billiard\n\nWe know that the trajectories between reflections are straight lines, so that the\ncomponents of \u1e59 in the cartesian coordinate frame are constant for each segment.\nIn our new z - \u03c1 frame of reference, the z-axis is the same as the cartesian one,\nso that we still have vz = \u017c = const between reflections in Eq. (80). However,\nthe same does not hold for the \u03c1-component of v. Instead, we obtain from Eq.\n(75)\nL2\n(83)\n\u03c1\u03072 + 2z = 1 \u2212 \u017c 2 = const.\n\u03c1\n\n29\n\n\fIf we multiply this by 4 \u03c12 , it can be written as a differential equation for \u03c12 :\n\u00132\n\u0012\nd 2\n= 4 \u03c12 \u03c1\u03072 = 4 (1 \u2212 \u017c 2 )\u03c12 \u2212 4 L2z .\n(84)\n\u03c1\ndl\nThe solution is that \u03c12 (l) describes a shifted parabola,\nq\n\u03c12 (l) = \u03c120 + 2 (l \u2212 li ) (1 \u2212 \u017c 2 ) \u03c12i \u2212 L2z + (l \u2212 li )2 (1 \u2212 \u017c 2 ),\n\n(85)\n\nwhere \u03c12i is the integration constant and specifies the value of \u03c12 (li ) at the\nstarting point li of the ray. Since furthermore z is a linear function of l (\u017c =\nconst), we can for definiteness fix the initial point is to lie on the focal plane\nand substitute\nl = l(z) = z/\u017c\n(86)\nto find that Eq. (85) describes a curved path \u03c1(z) in the z -\u03c1 plane. The curved\nnature of this trajectory is a direct consequence of the centrifugal potential\nL2z /\u03c12 in Eq. (75), and we would recover straight lines, i.e. linear variation of\n\u03c1(l) for Lz = 0. This is why we refer to this problem as a centrifugal billiard [17].\nFor a visual example of how curved traces arise from stright-line trajectories,\nthe reader is referred to Fig. 13 (e) which will be discussed in Section 7.\nAn example of the ray motion in the special case Lz = 0 is already displayed\nin Fig. 4, showing no curved trajectories because there the z - \u03c1 plane is indistinguishable from the cartesian z - x plane. For Lz 6= 0, curved ray trajectories\nin the z - \u03c1 plane are shown in Fig. 10 for four different initial conditions under\nwhich the ray is launched. Note that the parameter Lz as given in the plot\nhas dimensions of length, cf. Eq. (75). This reduced two-dimensional problem\ncan be analyzed completely without reference to the original three-dimensional\nray tracing, with Lz as a parameter that encapsulates the third degree of freedom \u03c6 which has been eliminated. We have, broadly speaking, converted to a\nco-rotating frame of reference (with rotation speed always matching the varying angular velocity of the ray), and thus obtained a planar problem in which\nwe now look for the classical orbits. The simplification is considerable because\nthe three-dimensional ray motion in the cavity is rather difficult to visualize,\ncompared to the motion in the z - \u03c1 plane.\nThe two periodic orbits in Fig. 10 (a) exemplify this situation: after the\ntrajectory completes one round-trip in the z - \u03c1 plane, it returns to its initial\nposition with the initial orientation \u2013 but in the original three-dimensional cavity\nthere has also been a motion in \u03c6 which does not necessarily amount to a full\nrotation around the z axis. Hence, this periodic orbit of the centrifugal billiard\nis not in general a true periodic orbit of the parabolic dome, cf. Fig. 13 (e).\nHowever, we can reverse this statement and conclude that any periodic orbit of\nthe three-dimensional problem must also be periodic in the z - \u03c1 plane. This\ncautionary remark concerning the interpretation of Fig. 10 is relevant if we\nattempt to interpret the actual modes of the original cavity in terms of a naive\n30\n\n\fFigure 10: All starting conditions for the rays in (a), (b) and (c) amount to the\nsame angular momentum, Lz = 0.1 f , but prescribe different angles of incidence\nwith respect to the boundary, and different positions of impact. (a) shows\ntwo different orbits in the same plot, both are periodic and symmetric in this\nprojection onto the z - \u03c1 plane, differing only in their starting points. (b)\nshows a single path, which is quasi-periodic because it does not close on itself\neven in this projection. Instead, it densely fills a region of space delimited by\na caustic whose shape is given by the parabolas (blue). The caustic becomes\nmore asymmetric in (c) and (d), each of which shows a quasiperiodic orbit.\nThe angular momentum in (d) is Lz = 0.6 f , leading to a larger forbidden zone\naround the z - axis.\nphysical optics approach: one might think that a quantized mode has to be\nassociated with ray paths that form a closed loop and in that way \"reproduce\"\nthemselves. However, a comparison between Figs. 9 and 10 reveals that periodic\norbits seem to play no special role for the mode structure.\nWhat shapes the modes is not any single periodic ray orbit, but the caustics\nas they appear in Fig. 10 (b) - (d). The spatial distribution of the ray trajectories\nexhibits a clear correspondence with the modal intensities shown in Fig. 9,\nparticularly in the shape of the caustics. This is most convincing for the two\nexamples in the bottom row of Fig. 9 where the wavelength is shortest: The\nstate at n = 3, x = 34.16, Z = \u22128.72 should be compared to Fig. 10 (c), and the\nreflection-symmetric mode with n = 4, x = 73.73, Z = 0 finds its counterpart\nin Fig. 10 (d).\nCaustics are immediately generated when we follow a single quasiperiodic\norbit, but not so for a periodic one. However, periodic orbits occur in infinte\nfamilies which, when plotted together, again fill a region of space bounded by a\ncaustic curve. The two members of the family shown in Fig. 10 (a) are obtained\nby launching a ray from the focal plane, perpendicular to it, differing only in\nthe radial distance \u03c1 of the launch. All other siblings of the examples in Fig. 10\n(a) combined, would create a picture almost identical to the one generated by\nthe single quasiperiodic orbit in Fig. 10 (b) \u2013 the latter is in fact the result of\nonly a slight deviation from the initial conditions chosen in Fig. 10 (a), with the\nresult that the orbit almost, but not quite, closes on itself after one round trip,\nand continues to fall short of closing itself after each subsequent round trip as\nwell. The conclusion is that from the point of view of the caustic structure in\n\n31\n\n\four system, there is no qualitative difference between periodic and quasiperiodic\norbits.\nThe fact that all orbits can be characterized by a particular caustic which\nthey touch, and that moreover all periodic orbits come in infinite families, is a\ngeneral property of integrable Hamiltonian systems, to which the special centrifugal billiard defined here belongs. That the paraboloid billiard is integrable,\ncan already be concluded from the existence of a separation ansatz for the wave\nequation, which we discussed in Section 3. However, we have not yet completed\nour program of connecting the ray and wave approaches, and in particular we\nhave not addressed the question of how to determine quantitatively the type of\nray trajectories that correspond to a given mode. So far, the correspondence\nwas established by visual inspection alone. The quantitative connection is obtained by comparing the ray patterns of Fig. 10 with the effective potential V\nof Eq. (45). We shall see that for an integrable system, we can in fact uniquely\nconnect a particular caustic with a given mode.\nAs a final remark concerning the periodic orbits in this integrable system,\nit is worth comparing the patterns of Fig. 10 (a) and especially Fig. (4) with\nthe \"bowtie laser\" of Ref. [18]. There, a semiconductor cavity was designed in\nsuch a way as to obtain lasing from a bowtie-shaped mode with highly desirable\nproperties, foremost among them its focussing action in the center of the cavity.\nThe focussing patterns of Fig. (4) are very similar, but the main difference is\nthat in our case these orbits occur in families whose members can cross the z = 0\nplane with all possible axial displacements \u03c1. In the semiconductor cavity, most\nrays move on chaotic trajectories, and only a small range of initial conditions\nfor the rays lead to a stable bowtie pattern, leading to modes which are strongly\nconcentrated near a unique bowtie path, and hence even less spread out in space\nthan the examples shown in Fig. 7. This leads us to anticipate that the beneficial\nproperties of the n = 1 modes found for our integrable system can in fact be\nenhanced if we allow for the possibility of chaos in the ray dynamics.\n\n6.4\n\nConnection with the effective potential in parabolic\ncoordinates\n\nThe classical turning points for the two degrees of freedom u and v in the\npotential of Eq. (45) determine the parabolas which describe the caustics in Fig.\n10. We notice that the caustics (and also the quasiperiodic rays that generate\nthe caustics we show) have a well-defined distance of closest approach \u03c10 with\nrespect to the z axis, given by the corner at which the two bounding parabolas\nmeet. Describing this in parabolic coordinates, we find that \u03c10 is approached if\nboth \u03be and \u03b7 simultaneously reach their inner turning points. Expressing this\ncondition in terms of Eqs. (47) and (51), we obtain the simple semiclassical\nrelation\nn\n(87)\n\u03c10 = .\nk\n32\n\n\f\u221a\nHere, we have used the coordinate transformation \u03c1 = \u03be \u03b7, cf. Eq. (3), and the\ndefinition of the rescaled variables, Eq. (42).\nThe distance of closest approach for individual periodic orbits is not given\nby this expression, but the minimal \u03c1 over the whole family of such orbits does\nfollow this law. The caustics in Figs. 10 (b-d) exhibit cusp singularities at\n\u03c10 because in that extreme point the z motion has zero velocity: it is clear\nfrom Eq. (75) that the smallest \u03c1 will be achieved when \u03c1\u0307 = \u017c = 0. But\nfrom the same equation we immediately obtain that the angular momentum\nthen equals the axial distance, and with Eq. (87) this reproduces Eq. (78).\nWe have therefore established that the ray's \"angular momentum\" is directly\nproportional to the modified angular momentum quantum number n of the\nmode under consideration. In the semiclassical limit of large k, the difference\nbetween n = m \u00b1 1 and m becomes negligible in this expression, so that we\nrecover the intuitively expected proportionality\nL z = \u03c10 \u2248\n\nm\n.\nk\n\n(88)\n\nThis approximation means that we can neglect the effect of polarization on the\nray-wave correspondence in the semiclassical limit \u2013 however, we shall make use\nof this only later, in the ray analysis of Section 7. Since we have been interested\nin states at rather small k and in particular n \u2265 1, we have plotted in Fig. 10\nonly trajectories with Lz 6= 0.\nA second semiclassical relation follows from Eqs. (47) and (51) if we ask for\nthe value z0 of z corresponding to the point u0 , v0 at which the caustics have\ntheir singularities. The whole caustic is uniquely determined by its singular\npoint at radial distance \u03c10 and height z0 , cf. Fig. 10. According to Eq. (3), we\nget\nZ\n.\n(89)\nz0 =\n2k\nThis identifies the meaning of the separation constant Z, also quantifying the\nearlier observation that for E = 0 both the wave and ray patterns are symmetric\nwith respect to the focal plane: in that case, the cusp occurs on this mirror plane,\nas in Fig. 10 (b).\nWith Eqs. (78) and (89), we have completed the bridge from the exact wave\nequation via semiclassical WKB quantization to the ray caustics. By specifying\nthe quantized n, Z and k of a given mode, we uniquely determine a caustic and\nwith it a particular family of ray paths. Now we can use additional properties\nof the ray picture to better understand the cavity modes. This is especially\npromising in this system because we have seen that the semiclassical approximation is extremely accurate here. The reason for this somewhat surprising\naccuracy lies itself in the properties of the ray dynamics, but in order to make\nthis clearer we need to introduce the concept of a phase space in which the ray\ndynamics can be described.\n\n33\n\n\f6.5\n\nFamilies of rays and Poincar\u00e9 sections\n\nA phase-space description is often used in classical mechanics because it carries\nmore information about the possible trajectories than mere real-space diagrams.\nThis approach has recently been applied to the analysis of ray dynamics in\noptical cavities as well [26, 27], with the goal of providing insights that are\nnot revealed by ray tracing in real space. In particular for the treatment of\nnon-integrable resonator geometries, it has proved valuable to represent the\nphase space of the rays in terms of Poincar\u00e9 Surfaces of Section (SOS). For our\npurposes, the following SOS will be chosen:\nIt is easy to convince ourselves by recalling Fig. 3 that any ray trajectory in\nthe cavity has to encounter the focal plane infinitely many times as it propagates.\nHowever, the radial distance of these crossings, as well as the value of \u03c1\u0307 may\nvary from one crossing of this plane to the next. Now we can consider\n\u03c1 and p\u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1\u0307\n\n(90)\n\nas a pair of canonically conjugate position and momentum variables, and attempt to image the subset of phase space spanned by them. In order to do\nthat, we launch a ray trajectory and follow it for many crossings of z = 0, each\ntime recording the instantaneous values of \u03c1, p\u03c1 as a point in a two-dimensional\ngraph. The result is shown in Fig. 11. A typical trajectory is \u2013 as mentioned\nabove \u2013 quasiperiodic, and in the SOS generates a dense set of points that all\nlie on a smooth curve. Several trajectories have been followed in this way and\nare represented in Fig. 11 by the different individual curves. Each curve exhibits some minimal axial distance \u03c1min > \u03c10 ; this is a true inequality because\nquasiperiodic orbits do not reach their point of closest approach to the z axis\nprecisely on the focal plane. Since the SOS records the instantaneous \u03c1 upon\ncrossing the focal plane, the resulting curves have their turning points at larger\n\u03c1.\nThe only orbits which have their real turning points exactly at the focal plane\nare the periodic orbits. A periodic orbit as displayed in Fig. 10 (a) generates\nexactly two discrete points in the SOS, corresponding to the two distinct values\nof the radial distance \u03c1 at which the axis z = 0 is crossed. Both points in the SOS\nlie at p\u03c1 = 0 for the periodic orbit, as can be verified from the trajectory in the\nz - \u03c1 plane which always crosses the z axis perpendicularly. The quasiperiodic\ntrajectory of Fig. 10 (b) corresponds to the leftmost curve in Fig. 11, which has\nits turning point almost at \u03c10 in the SOS. The caustic is almost on the focal\nplane but still offset from it by an amount that is not discernible in Fig. 10 (b).\nThe distinction between the periodic orbit and its closely neighboring quasiperiodic relative in the SOS of Fig. 11 is appreciable \u2013 a pair of points generated by\nthe former, versus a one-dimensional curve for the latter. But exactly on the\nline p\u03c1 = 0, there exists an infinite number of other pairs of points, belonging\nto the periodic orbits of the same family.\n\n34\n\n\fFigure 11: Poincar\u00e9 surface of section of the ray dynamics for Lz = 0.1 f as in\nFig. 10 (a-c). The minimum distance \u03c10 from the z axis, given by Eq. (87), is\nindicated by the dashed line. All quasiperiodic trajectories fill smooth curves\nextending between some minimum \u03c1min \u2265 \u03c10 and \u03c1 = 2 f . The two gray dots\nare the crossings of the focal plane generated by a periodic orbit as shown in\nFig. 10 (a). The plot uses 2 f as the length unit.\nThe SOS in these coordinates allows us to see directly in which places the\nfocal plane comes into contact with the rays under consideration. This is a\ncentral piece of information when it comes to estimating the focussing at this\nplane where the quantum well is assumed to be. The forbidden regions around\nthe z axis induced by the angular momentum barrier show up as inaccessible\nportions of the SOS toward small \u03c1.\n\n6.6\n\nAccuracy of the semiclassical approximation\n\nWe can also comment on the striking accuracy of the semiclassical approach\nin this system. The Poincar\u00e9 section shows that almost all trajectories (with\nthe exception of the periodic paths) generate curves with the same topology:\nthey begin and end at \u03c1 = 2 f , with one turning point inbetween. There are\nother integrable systems for which the Poincar\u00e9 section has a more complicated\nstructure, one closely related example being the ellipsoidal cavity[22] or its twodimensional counterpart, the ellipse billiard[25]. In that case, the phase space\nconsists of two components in which the topology of the trajectories is different:\nOne type of motion consists of rays circulating around the perimeter as socalled whispering-gallery orbits, the other is a bouncing-ball oscillation across\nthe short diameter[20]. There is a division between these two types of trajectories, similar to that between oscillation and rotation in a pendulum \u2013 called the\nseparatrix. The WKB approximation or its higher-dimensional generalization,\nnamed after Einstein, Brillouin and Keller (EBK), cannot be applied without\nsevere corrections in the vicinity of such a separatrix in phase space [21, 22, 25].\nIn our case, this breakdown never occurs, and semiclassical results are thus of\nhigh accuracy. Being a conic section, the parabola can of course be considered\nas a limiting case of the ellipse, with one of its foci moved to infinity. This\nleaves no possibility for bouncing-ball trajectories, which leads to the absence\n\n35\n\n\fof a separatrix.\nFinally, it is worth asking why the sharp corners at the intersection between\nthe paraboloid and the focal plane do not cause any corrections to our semiclassical treatment, even though the surface curvature at these points is clearly\nmuch shorter than the wavelength. It is known that in such cases diffraction can\noccur which makes it impossible to explain the mode structure purely based on\nclassical orbits[23, 24]. However, this phenomenon is absent for certain special\nangles subtended by the corners. One of these \"benign\" angles is precisely the\n90\u25e6 angle we encounter at the corners of the double paraboloid, cf. Fig. 3. When\nthe confocal condition is violated so that deviations from a right angle occur at\nthe corners, we have to expect diffractive corrections to the semiclassical analysis, resulting from classical rays that hit the corners and are reflected in an\narbitrary direction because the law of specular reflection is undefined in that\ninstance. Fortunately, we shall see in Section 7 that such orbits are far removed\nfrom the regions of phase space where we expect the important focussing modes\nto lie.\nIn this section, we have discussed how the ray dynamics develops caustic\nstructure, and how the latter can be represented with the help of the Poincar\u00e9\nsection. We have also observed that the high-intensity regions in the wave\nsolutions correspond to the ray caustics, because there the density of rays is\nhigh - in fact divergent if we recall the discussion of the classical turning points\nin the effective potential below Eq. (47). Therefore, even in situations where we\ncannot obtain the wave solutions easily, their possible intensity distribution can\nbe inferred by investigating the ray dynamics first. This will now be carried out\nfor a cavity that deviates from the ideal model shape.\n\n7\n\nThe non-confocal double paraboloid\n\nHaving obtained an overview of the types of ray motion that can be encounterd\nin the parabolic dome, and established the connection to the mode structure\nof the full vectorial wave equations via the short-wavelength approximation, we\nnow want to introduce a model cavity for which the wave solutions cannot be\nobtained by separation of variables. The variety of possible deviations from the\nideal model geometry of Fig. 3 is enormous, so we have to restrict attention to\ncertain special distortions that can be expected to be generic in some sense.\n\n7.1\n\nThe model deformation\n\nThe distortions we choose are obtained by pulling the two intersecting paraboloids\nin Fig. 3 apart or pushing them together along the z axis by an amount 2 \u01eb.\nSpecifically, in spherical coordinates as a function of polar angle \u03b8, the shape is\n\n36\n\n\fgiven by\nr(\u03b8) =\n\n2f\n2\u01eb\np\n+\n.\n1 + cos \u03b8 1 + 1 + \u01eb (1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8)\n\n(91)\n\nThe respective foci, which coincide in the integrable model, then move off the\n\u03c1 axis. This non-confocal arrangement of the parabolic walls can be viewed as\na model for fabrication-induced deviations from the ideal cavity shape \u2013 where\nthe dome could be slightly too flat or too pointed. It can also be interpreted in\na different way, taking into account the possibility that the boundary condition\nat the base of the dome is not exactly given by Eq. (7), if some penetration\nof the field through the dielectric mirror on the quantum well is taken into\naccount. This is of course a realistic expectation, and its effect on the wave\nsolutions would be that the TE electric field no longer needs to be strictly\nsymmetric under reflection at the focal plane. If one maintains that the dome\nhas indeed been fabricated with its base in the focal plane, this \"soft\" boundary\ncondition on the mirror can be modeled by assuming that our solutions should\ncorrespond to waves reflected at a plane removed from the dielectric interface\nby some amount \u01eb.\nTherefore, the non-confocal double paraboloid is a way of taking into account\nthe cumulative effects of fabrication uncertainty and soft boundary conditions at\nthe dielectric mirror with a single model parameter \u01eb, denoting half the distance\nbetween the foci of the top and bottom parabolic wall in the unfolded cavity.\nOne could think that a perturbation theory in \u01eb could allow us to use the solutions obtained so far and smoothly extend them to the non-confocal situation.\nThis is the traditional approach in physics and it is the reason why only simple,\nintegrable systems are treated in textbooks on quantum mechanics or classical mechanics alike. However, perturbation approaches become tedious and\neven impossible for wave equations whose short-wavelength limit (i.e. ray picture) exhibits chaotic dynamics. The difficulties that arise can already be seen\nwithout introducing chaos, if we try to obtain the wave functions of an ellpsoidshaped resonator as a perturbative expansion starting from the eigenfunctions\nof a spherical cavity. This poses no problems as long as one is interested only\nin modes of the ellipsoid whose topology is analogous to that found in the circle\n[28]. However, as mentioned earlier, the ellipsoid exhibits separatrix structure\nin phase space because there exists a type of motion that the sphere does not\npossess: the bouncing-ball trajectories.\nAnalogous nonperturbative effects arise in the present model, because the\ndistortion can lead to new types of trajectories that are not present in the confocal cavity, in a process known as bifurcation [29, 30]. The first consequence of\nthe deformation \u01eb is that the infinite families of periodic orbits break up, leaving\nonly a distrete number of periodic orbits of the same topology, which can be\ndivided in an equal number of stable and unstable paths. Stable paths have the\nproperty that rays with slightly different initial conditions remain close to the\ngiven periodic path for all times, while unstable periodic orbits are surrounded\n\n37\n\n\fFigure 12: Surface of section at Lz = 0.1 f of a non-confocal double-paraboloid,\nwith foci pulled apart by \u01eb = 0.02 f . This destabilizes the cavity, leading to\nchaotic ray dynamics which generates an irregular cloud of points filling almost\nthe whole region that is accessible for this Lz . A special point is encountered\non the line p\u03c1 = 0 where the irregularity gives way to a confluence of hyperbolic\ntraces whose vertices are centered on a single, unstable periodic orbit. The\nspatial pattern of this new periodic orbit is shown in Fig. 13 (a).\nin their immediate neighborhood by chaos \u2013 trajectories deviate from such a\nperiodic orbit at an exponential rate if the initial condition is only infinitesimally varied. For more quantitative statements and further background on the\ntransition to chaos, the reader is referred to the literature [29, 31, 17].\n\n7.2\n\nUnstable and stable ray motion in the deformed cavity\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9 section is very suitable as a diagnostic tool to identify this process\nof emerging chaos on on hand, and the stabilization of certain periodic orbits\non the other hand. This is illustrated in Fig. 12. The perturbation consists of\npulling the foci of the walls apart by \u01eb = 0.02 f along the z - axis. Since this\npreserves the axial symmetry of the cavity, Lz is still a conserved quantity \u2013\nthe arguments of Section 6.3 rely on no other symmetries of the problem. We\nchose Lz = 0.1 f in the plot. The small distortion of one percent is already\nsufficient to change the phase space portrait significantly, compared to Fig.\n11). The unstable periodic orbit appearing prominently in Fig. 12) as a socalled hyperbolic point, is shown in its spatial pattern in Fig. 13 (a). It is a\nself-retracing periodic orbit because it reflects from the boundary at normal\nincidence (in the z - \u03c1 plane).\nThe effects that chaos can have on the ray motion are illustrated in Fig.\n13 (b). Shown there is a single ray trajectory which superficially has some\nsimilarity to Fig. 10 (b). However, the path does not trace out a well-defined\ncaustic in Fig. 13 (b). What looks like a caustic here is in fact better described\nas two caustics of the type in Fig. 10, arranged almost symmetrically with\nrespect to the focal plane. Note in particular the symmetric occurrence of cusps\nboth below and above the line z = 0. Recall that in the integrable case the\nposition \u03c10 , z0 of the caustic singularity is uniquely given by the turning points\n\n38\n\n\fFigure 13: Trajectories in the non-confocal cavity. (a) shows the unstable periodic orbit arising at \u01eb = 0.02 f , Lz = 0.1 f , cf. Fig. 12. For the same parameter,\na chaotic trajectory is seen in (b). Oscillatory motion around stable periodic\norbits occurs in (c) and (d), where \u01eb = \u22120.02 f and Lz = 0.1 f as in the SOS\nof Fig. 14. The patterns of type (a) and (c) derive from the periodic motion\nof Fig. 10 (a) as a result of the shape perturbation. In real three-dimensional\ncartesian space, (e) shows the straight-line ray motion (arrows) giving rise to\nthe curved \"envelope\" surface whose cross section we see in (a).\n\u03be0 and \u03b70 (or equivalently u0 , v0 ), in the effective potential. Reversing the sign\nof the cusp coordinate z0 corresponds to exchanging the role of \u03be and \u03b7. The\nsignificance of Fig. 13 (b) is therefore that the degrees of freedom \u03be and \u03b7 are\nno longer decoupled, because during a single ray trajectory both the cusps at z0\nand \u2212z0 are reached. By virtue of Eq. (89), the quantity Z is thus not conserved\nanymore. A trajectory is able to exhibit multiple points of closest approach to\nthe z axis and is not strictly guided by caustics.\nUnder these circumstances, it is not clear what to expect for the mode structure of the cavity because we lose the possibility of labeling the eigenstates by\na complete set of quantum numbers. This does not imply there are no modes\nassociated with chaotic rays, but one requires additional techniques to perform\na semiclassical quantization [31, 32]. The destruction of the conserved quantity\nZ means that there is one less constraint which the ray trajectories have to satisfy; this allows them to fill two-dimensional areas instead of one-dimensional\ncurves in the SOS. Since the SOS gives us a picture of how the rays intersect\nthe plane z = 0, chaotic rays can be seen to show less concentrated overlap with\nthat plane. We anticipate that the presence of true caustics is required to create\nthe best focussing action. With this hypothesis, the goal must be to identify\nray orbits that exhibit caustics. This occurs in the vicinity of stable periodic\norbits, due to the fact that perturbed trajectories execute an oscillatory and in\ngeneral quasi-periodic motion around such stable orbits. In Fig. 12, however,\nno stable periodic orbits can be identified, telling us that for the deformation\nchosen ther, no stable modes with Lz = 0.1 f should exist.\nThe situation changes if we consider Fig. 14, in which Lz is the same but\nthe sign of the non-confocal displacement \u01eb is reversed. The walls of the double paraboloid are hence pushed together instead of being pulled apart. The\nresulting phase space structure in the SOS differs markedly from Fig. 12: many\ntrajectories trace out one-dimensional curves in the SOS which organize as closed\nloops, forming island chains that proliferate with various sizes. All these islands\n39\n\n\fFigure 14: Surface of section at Lz = 0.1 f with \u01eb = \u22120.02 f . The cavity develops a multitude of stable periodic orbits surrounded by elliptical islands. The\nmost prominent island of stability is centerd on the the line p\u03c1 = 0 where a small\ncircle indicates the location of the corresponding periodic orbit around which\nother trajectories can oscillate. Shown in the inset is the central stable periodic orbit. The next innermost closed line in the SOS belongs to the trajectory\nshown in Fig. 13 (c).\nare centered around stable periodic orbits \u2013 the biggest island of stability lies\nsymmetrically around the line z = 0 and corresponds to oscillatory motion of\nthe type shown in Fig. 13 (c). The center of the island is in fact formed by\na periodic orbit similar to Fig. 13 (a) \u2013 the only difference being, that small\nperturbations of its initial conditions do not lead to chaos as in Fig. 12, but to\nthe motion of Fig. 13 (c).\nAnother oscillatory ray path centered at a stable periodic orbit is shown in\nFig. 13 (d). The pattern should be compared to Fig. 10 (c) which has the same\nLz . The similarity is apparent, except for the fact that the path in Fig. 10 (c)\nwill eventually fill the remaining gaps in that plot, if one follows it longer. The\npath in Fig. 13 (d), on the other hand, is truly restricted to the vicinity of a\nself-retracing orbit which reverses its propagation direction at one end due to\nperpendicular reflection at the wall, and at the other end by running up the\ncentrifugal barrier perpendicular to the z axis.\nAll islands of stability in Fig. 14 generate their own caustics, which are topologically different from the ones in the integrable system. The caustic created by\nthe orbit in Fig. 13 (c) is simply the boundary of the regions into which the ray\nnever penetrates. The difference between the absence and presence of caustics\nin Figs. 13 (b) and (c) is not easily appreciated if we consider only the real-space\nplots. Here, the usefulness of the Poincar\u00e9 section as a diagnostic tool is again\nto be noted \u2013 showing two-dimensional clouds of points versus one-dimensional\ncurves, respectively, for trajectories without and with caustics.\nIt follows from the preceding discussion that a negative \u01eb leaves us with a\ncavity that is in many respects similar to the unperturbed double paraboloid, cf.\nthe ray pattern of Fig. 13 (d). However, the qualitative and important difference\nis that some periodic orbits are now more stabilized than at \u01eb = 0. In particular,\nthere are simple ray bundles such as Fig. 13 (c) that promise reasonable focusing\n\n40\n\n\fFigure 15: For the same deformation \u01eb = 0.02 f as in Fig. 12, this surface of\nsection at the smaller angular momentum Lz = 0.03 f shows that a stable orbit\nexists in addition to the unstable hyperbolic one. This is indicated by the elliptic\n(lens-shaped) island structure. The hyperbolic point is located to the right of\nthe island. The ray pattern near the stable periodic orbit is shown in the inset.\nThe small corresponding mode volume is apparent.\nclose to the center of the unfolded cavity. The physical explanation for the\ngeneral stabilizing effect that we achieved by moving the paraboloids closer\ntogether lies in the well-known fact that a two-mirror resonator configuration\nhas a a focusing action when the mirrors are separated less than the sum of\ntheir radii of curvature. Conversely, mirrors that are further apart than this\ncriterium act in a defocusing way. This is consistent with the observation of a\nlarge chaotic domain in Fig. 12.\nThese simple arguments, and the chaotic picture of Fig. 12, seem to suggest\nthat stable ray motion is not to be expected in the supposedly defocusing configuration with \u01eb = 0.02 f . However, when applying the standard criteria for\nfocusing and defocusing resonator geometries, we have to bear in mind that we\nare dealing with a centrifugal billiard whose ray trajectories are curved. The\neffect of the centrifugal barrier is to push the regions of allowed ray motion outwards until only a small patch surrounding the equatorial corners of the cavity\nis accessible. At large Lz the motion is then so confined that chaos does not develop. This is just the whispering-gallery phenomenon[17]. On the other hand,\nat Lz = 0.1 f we certainly found chaos with no remaining islands of stability.\nSmall Lz are what we must be interested in if concentration near the focal points\nis to be achieved.\nIn view of this, it is all the more surprising that the same cavity does in fact\nsupport stable orbits at even smaller angular momenta than in Fig. 12. This is\nshown in Fig. 15 for Lz = 0.03 f . The periodic orbit responsible for the single\nstable island in that SOS is again almost identical to the one shown in Fig. 13\n(a), and its oscillatory neighborhood is analogous to Fig. 13 (c); the inset of\nFig. 15 shows this similarity. This stable orbit exists only at sufficiently small\nLz ; its associated island in the SOS shrinks to a point when Lz \u2248 0.038 f . The\nconclusion is that both the nominally focusing and defocusing configurations\n\u01eb = \u00b10.02 f permit the formation of ray bundles with a spatial distribution as\n41\n\n\fin Fig. 13 (c), and hence the stable modes associated with this pattern should\nbe robust. This is also confirmed by analogous Poincar\u00e9 sections for larger\ndisplacements of the foci. At larger |\u01eb|, the motion of type Fig. 13 (c) and the\ninset of Fig. 15 is in fact stabilized further \u2013 for both directions of displacements\nalike.\nThe modes corresponding to this particular ray pattern are closely related\nto the fundamental s-waves we discussed in Section 3.5, because both arise from\nray bundles in the immediate vicinity of the shortest periodic orbits in the cavity.\nFor \u01eb = 0 this was the family of paths in Fig. 10 (a), members of which can be\nsmoothly deformed into Fig. 13 (a) without changing the topology \u2013 i.e., the\nnumber and sequence of reflections and turning points. We shall therefore call\nall these orbits the fundamental orbits of the cavity. The mode spacing of the\ncorresponding eigenstates should be comparable as well for the perturbed and\nunperturbed case. However, we have to defer a detailed analysis of the wave\nsolutions and their semiclassical correspondence to a future paper. Here, the\ngoal has been to introduce the ray dynamics and its phase space as the backbone\non which the mode structure is built.\nAssuming that the deformation is \u01eb = 0.02 f , we have the peculiar situation\nthat the fundamental orbit is unstable if Lz > 0.038 f , cf. Fig. 12. Therefore,\nthe most desirable modes will be those with smaller Lz . According to Eq.\n(78), we have to choose modes with low n and high k to achieve this. For the\nexperimental cavity we have k f \u2248 14\u03c0. Taking n = 1 as in Section 3.5, we\narrive at the semiclassical value\nLz =\n\nf\n\u2248 0.023 f\n14 \u03c0\n\n(92)\n\nwhich is close to the situation depicted in Fig. 15. The difference in the SOS\nis insignificant. We have no accurate way of determining the actual value of\n\u01eb most closely describing the real structure, but these considerations give us\nconsiderable confidence that modes with a spatial pattern as in Fig. 13 (c) or\nFig. 15 will be found in the cavity, because the relevant Lz estimated above is\nin a range where this fundamental orbit is stable \u2013 irrespective of the sign of \u01eb\nand moreover largely independent of its magnitude.\n\n8\n\nBragg mirror as an escape window in phase\nspace\n\nThe internal ray dynamics of the dome resonator has up to this point been\nevaluated under the assumption that the cavity is a perfect resonator. There\nare two physical mechanisms that invalidate this viewpoint: absorption in the\ngold mirror and transmission through the Bragg grating. The trade-off between\nthe comparatively large absorption of a metal on the one hand and its ability\nto reflect omnidirectionally have been discussed in Ref. [33]. In our context,\n42\n\n\fmetallic absorption will always degrade the Q factor because the gold layer provides only an estimated 95% reflectivity [33]. However, the reflectivity of the\nBragg mirror can be significantly lower for certain modes and in that case constitutes the dominant mechanism for Q-spoiling. The variable that determines\nthe reflectivity of the Bragg mirror (at the fixed operating frequency) is the angle of incidence \u03c7 with respect to the z-axis. For the purposes of a qualitative\nanalysis, we assume that the Bragg reflectivity is unity for \u03c7 < 22\u25e6 \u2261 \u03c7c but\ndrops to \u2248 20% outside this cone of incidence [33]. In other words, \u03c7c is the\nboundary between absorption-dominated and leakage-dominated Q factors. A\nsecond window of high reflectivity opens for rays at very oblique incidence on\nthe grating surface, more specifically for \u03c7 > 60\u25e6 . This second window will be\ndiscussed further below.\nThe ray picture allows us to use this rough transmission criterion as a guide\nin order to separate long-lived cavity modes from short-lived ones. The angle \u03c7\nbetween z-axis and a trajectory is, according to Eq. (72), given by\ncos \u03c7 = \u1e59 * ez = \u017c,\n\n(93)\n\n1 \u2212 \u017c 2 = sin2 \u03c7.\n\n(94)\n\nso that\nOne can substitute this as the righthand side of Eq. (83) and obtains an equation\nfor a curve in the plane \u03c1\u0307, \u03c1 (\u03c1\u0307 = p\u03c1 ) spanning the Poincar\u00e9 section:\ns\nL2\n(95)\n|p\u03c1 | = sin2 \u03c7 \u2212 2z .\n\u03c1\nUsing the critical value of \u03c7c in this equation specifies the escape condition in\nthe Poincar\u00e9 section: the Bragg mirror becomes ineffective when\ns\nL2\n|p\u03c1 | > sin2 \u03c7c \u2212 2z .\n(96)\n\u03c1\nIn order to get a feeling for the type of ray orbits that can remain in the\ncavity under this escape condition, we plot in Fig. 16 the resulting curves in\nthe surface of section for the two different values of Lz appearing in Figs. 11,\n12, 14 and 15. The plot should be superimposed on these plots to decide which\nparts of the respective phase space falls within the high-reflectivity range of the\nDBR grating. Note that the critical lines for ray escape are independent of\ndeformation because they rely only on Eq. (83).\nAs a result of this comparison, we find first of all that low angular momenta\nare required by the escape criterion, because the phase-space area enclosed by\nthe critical curves in Fig. 16 shrinks with increasing Lz . This is understandable because the ray motion in this case has a strong azimuthal component\n\n43\n\n\fFigure 16: Assuming that the Bragg mirror stack at the plane z = 0 yields\nhigh reflectivity only for waves within \u03c7c = 22\u25e6 from the surface normal or for,\nthe regions of high reflectivity in the Poincar\u00e9 section are bounded by Eq. (96).\nThe resulting curves bounded by |p\u03c1 < 0.374 are shown for Lz = 0.03 (solid\nline) and Lz = 0.1 (dashed). A second high-reflectivity window exists for rays\nfalling between the boundary of this plot and the solid line near the boundary. It\nbecomes relevant only for the integrable confocal cavity because the perturbed\nshapes have no stable orbits in this second window.\ncontributing to the tilt angle with respect to the z-axis. Let us turn our attention to the stable periodic orbits arising in the chaotic Poincar\u00e9 sections. The\ncase Lz = 0.1 f shown previously for illustrative purposes turns out now to be\nroughly the maximum angular momentum at which the stable orbit of Fig. 14\nis still confined by Bragg reflection. The lower angula momentum Lz = 0.03 f\ncoming close to the estimated value for the s-waves of our experimental cavity, on\nthe other hand, places the stable periodic orbit well inside the high-reflectivity\nrange of the DBR. For the case of a defocusing deformation this is illustrated\nin Fig. 15. The peridic point is at \u03c1 \u2248 0.086. For a focusing deformation of the\nsame magnitude, \u01eb = \u22120.02, the periodic point lies at \u03c1 \u2248 0.99. Both values are\nto the right of the solid line in Fig. 16, corresponding to high reflectivity.\nFor the chaotic orbits, we observe that they spread out over the Poincar\u00e9\nsection in such a way as to yield significant overlap with the low-reflectivity\nregions of Fig. 16. This is true for all Poincar\u00e9 sections shown in this paper.\nTherefore, we conclude that cavity modes associated with the chaotic phase space\nregions are short-lived, and the corresponding broad resonances will not affect\nthe spontaneous emission enhancement of the parabolic dome. A quantitative\nestimate of the resonance lifetimes could be obtained by measuring the time that\na chaotic trajectory spends, on average, in the high-reflectivity region without\nexcursions beyond the critical line. However, we shall not attempt quantitative\npredictions at this stage of our investigation, and defer it to future work.\nA quantitative analysis would also be necessary to determine the modal lifetimes in the marginal case of the ideal confocal cavity. The reason is that the\nray picture alone does not allow a clear distinction between classically confined\nand unconfined orbits, because the classification according to stable and unstable trajectories does not apply in the integrable parabolic dome. All the solid\n\n44\n\n\fFigure 17: The Poincar\u00e9 section combined with the escape conditions can be\nused to extract information about the lifetime and escape locations. This is\nillustrated here for a single ray orbit (black trace), followed for 500 crossings of\nthe focal plane. The gray area is the region which has to be avoided by the ray\nin order to remain in the cavity.\ncurves in the Poincar\u00e9 section of Fig. 11 cross into the low-reflectivity region\nof Fig. 16 at some point, but the time spent in the high-reflectivity range can\nbe very long classically. To illustrate this, we show in Fig. 17 a particular ray\ntrajectory for Lz = 0.1 f in the confocal paraboliod, which for almost 500 crossings of the focal plane remains inside the regions of high reflectivity. This time,\nthe second window of high reflectivity close to the border of the SOS is important because the ray alternates between the low- and high-\u03c7 windows from\none crossing of the focal plane to the next. The regular nature of this motion\nmakes long lifetimes possible because it strictly prevents the ray from entering\nthe low-reflectivity region for long times, whereas a chaotic orbit would quickly\nexplore this domain in a quasi-random way.\nThe trajectory shown in Fig. 17 is practically identical to the one shown in\nFig. 10 (b). The alternating way of intersecting the focal plane can be understood from that figure, or from Fig. 10 (a) which shows periodic orbits closely\nneighboring the quasiperiodic trajectory of plot (b). Note that the ray model allows us in addition to predict the spatial location where the mode corresponding\nto this ray bundle will preferentially be coupled out through the Bragg mirror.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 17, the low-reflectivity region is reached for the first\ntime when, after many reflections, the trajectory departs from the immediate\nneighborhood of the focal region, i.e. intersects the focal plane with a \u03c1 that is\nslightly too large.\nThe subtle balance of parameters that prevents chaos from appearing will, in\nall experimental realizations, be shifted to either the defocusing or the focusing\nside. Therefore, the above ray analysis of the mixed phase spaces for these\ntwo situations above is our main concern. However, as in the previous sections\nthe integrable case is a useful starting point to illustrate our strategy. The\nadvantage of the ray approach is that it provides fast and intuitive predictions,\nbut further studies are required in order to determine how this model succeeds in\ncharacterizing the cavity quantitatively. Paradoxically, we can already conclude\n\n45\n\n\fthat the existence of chaos and islands of stability makes it easier to obtain\nresults from a ray analysis, because there is a sharper separation between long\nlifetimes for the stable modes discussed above and short lifetimes for modes\nassociated with the chaotic portions of the SOS.\n\n9\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have examined the modal structure of the electromagnetic field\nin a semiconfocal plano-parabolic cavity (or, equivalently, in a double-paraboloid\nconfocal cavity) in view of our recent fabrication of semiconductor microcavities\nhaving that geometry. In order to account for the effects of the inevitable\nfabrication defects we also considered the stability of the modes with respect to\ndeformations consisting of deviations with respect confocality. This theoretical\nanalysis was thus motivated by our ongoing experiments on these structures,\nand feeds back into this experimental work by opening a novel perspective in\nterms of investigating the chaotic structure and dynamics of some of the modes\nof cavity.\nRegarding the structure of the modes in the parabolic cavity, we note that\nthe scalar wave equation is solvable analytically by separation of variables. However, the vectorial boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field destroy this\nproperty, leaving only the cylindrical symmetry. Nevertheless, the fundamental\nseries of s-waves (free of azimuthal nodes) in a confocal electromagnetic cavity can be solved rigorously. It has its energy concentrated in a small volume\n(of order \u03bb3 ) around the focal point, even though at the focal point itself the\nelectric field is zero due to the vectorial nature of the field. The higher order\nmodes cannot be solved as readily in the full three-dimensional model, but it is\npossible to appreciate their features by reducing the problem to scalar form. In\nthese higher order modes, the energy is concentrated in lobes that surround the\nfocal point but avoid it because of the centrifugal barrier that arises from the\ncylindrical symmetry. Indeed, these modes correspond to non-zero values of the\nangular momentum (m 6= 0) and for large values of m tend towards a type of\nwhispering-gallery modes with intensity concentrated in a ring along the focal\nplane, [cf. Fig. 10 (d)].\nThe stability of the modes of the parabolic cavity with respect to geometrical\ndeformations can be assessed by examining the ray trajectories that correspond\nto each mode. For a deformation that corresponds to a small deviation from\nconfocality, chaotic ray patterns emerge. However, we also find stable ray orbits\nconcentrated in a small part of the cavity volume. Independent of deformation,\nthe most important stable orbits being those which in cylinder coordinates \u03c1\nand z follow the shortest possible periodic trajectory. This general topology is\nthe same for a range of deformations (including the ideal confocal cavity) and\ncorresponds to a ray returning to the same \u03c1 and z after two reflections, missing\nthe focal point by a small amount because the field there has to vanish. The\n46\n\n\fgeneric shape of this orbit is represented in Fig.13, and its special modification in\nthe confocal case with its marginal stability is shown in Fig.10. The topological\nequivalence between the stable orbits of the distorted cavity on one hand and of\nthe confocal system on the other indicates that the structure of the fundamental\ns-wave is stable with respect to deformations.\nFrom the experimental viewpoint, the results of this theoretical analysis indicate that the cavities already fabricated in our laboratory should possess stable\nmodes in which the energy is confined in a volume of order \u03bb3 in the vicinity\nof the focal point, in spite of fabrication errors. The higher order modes, in\nwhich the field is concentrated away from the focal point, in whispering-gallery\ntype configurations, will be unstable because of the presence of fabrication defects. At the same time these modes will decay very fast as they correspond to\noblique incidences onto the Bragg mirror, at angles for which the mirror is no\nlonger reflecting. Experiments are in progress to characterize the structure and\ndynamics of both the stable and unstable modes [7]. The robust stable modes\nin which the field is confined in the vicinity of the focal point should give rise\nto strong enhancement of the spontaneous emission of a dipole (such as a semiconductor quantum well or a semiconductor quantum box) placed there, and\na concomitant lowering of the lasing threshold, even for our cavities that are\nof mesoscopic dimensions. This is because because even in such large cavities,\nwhose geometric volume is of the order of a few thousand cubic wavelengths,\nthe central lobe of the fundamental s-wave (which contains most of the energy)\nhas an effective volume of the order of one cubic wavelength.\nThese considerations underscore the interest that parabolic microresonators\npresent by exhibiting quantum electrodynamic effects as well as optical chaos,\nin spite of their relatively large dimensions. In addition, the mesoscopic cavity dimensions of these structures are an important practical feature, as they\nmake the fabrication accessible to existing experimental techniques (such as Focused Ion Beam etching) while, at the same time, they greatly facilitate the\ntheoretical analysis of these devices as they permit the use of short-wavelength\napproximations.\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported in part by the European Commission through an ESPRIT-LTR contract (No. 20029 \"ACQUIRE\") and a\nTMR Network (\"Microlasers and Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics\").\n\nA\n\nParabolic coordinates\n\nThe parabolic coordinates \u03be, \u03b7, \u03c6 are related to the three-dimensional cartesian\ncoordinates according to\n\uf8f1\n\u221a\n\uf8f2 x = \u221a \u03be\u03b7 cos \u03c6\ny = \u03be\u03b7 sin \u03c6\n(97)\n\uf8f3\nz = 12 (\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)\n47\n\n\fOr, equivalently,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03be =r+z\n\u03b7 =r\u2212z\n\uf8f3\n\u03c6 = arctan xy\n\n(98)\n\np\nwhere r = x2 + y 2 + z 2 is the spherical radius vector.

The surfaces \u03be = constant are paraboloids by revolution about the positive \u1e91-axis having their focal point at the origin, while the\nsurfaces \u03b7 = constant are directed along the negative \u1e91-axis.
