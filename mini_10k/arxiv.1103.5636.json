Introduction\nThe study of deuterated molecules is an extremely useful probe\nof the physical conditions in star-forming regions. Deuterated\nspecies are readily produced in molecular environments characterised by low temperatures (T \u2264 20 K) and CO depletion\n(Millar et al. 1989). These physical/chemical properties are commonly observed in low-mass pre\u2013stellar cores (starless cores on\nthe verge of forming stars), where the deuterated fraction (hereafter Dfrac ) of non-depleted molecules, defined as the column\ndensity ratio of one species containing deuterium to its counterpart containing hydrogen, is orders of magnitude larger than the\n[D/H] interstellar abundance (of the order of \u223c 10\u22125 , Oliveira et\nal. 2003). Caselli (2002a) found a theoretical relation between\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations carried out with the IRAM 30m telescope.\nIRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and\nIGN (Spain).\n\nDfrac and the core evolution in the low-mass case. This relation\npredicts that Dfrac increases when the starless core evolves towards the onset of gravitational collapse because, as the core\ndensity profile becomes more and more centrally peaked, freezeout of CO increases in the core centre and hence the abundance of deuterated molecules is greatly enhanced. When the\nyoung stellar object formed at the core centre begins to heat its\nsurroundings, the CO evaporated from dust grains starts to destroy the deuterated species and Dfrac decreases. Observations\nof both starless cores and cores with already formed protostars\nconfirm the theoretical predictions in the low-mass regime: the\npre\u2013stellar cores closest to gravitational collapse have the highest Dfrac (Crapsi et al. 2005), while Dfrac is lower in cores associated with Class 0/I protostars, and the coldest (i.e. the youngest)\nobjects possess the largest Dfrac , again in agreement with the predictions of chemical models (Emprechtinger et al. 2009, Friesen\net al. 2010). On the basis of these results, Dfrac can be considered\n\n1\n\n\fFontani et al.: Deuteration in massive-star formation\n\nas an evolutionary tracer of the low-mass star formation process\nbefore and after the formation of the protostellar object.\nCan this result be applied to the high-mass regime? This\nquestion is difficult to answer because the massive-star formation process is still not well-understood: large distances (\u2265 1\nkpc), high extinction and clustered environments make observations of the process challenging (Beuther et al 2007a, Zinnecker\n& Yorke 2007). Observationally, the study of Pillai et al. (2007),\nperformed with the Effelsberg and IRAM-30m telescopes, measured high values of Dfrac (\u223c 0.2) from deuterated ammonia\nin infrared dark clouds, which are understood to represent the\nearliest stages of massive star and stellar cluster formation. In\nmore evolved objects, from IRAM-30m observations, Fontani et\nal. (2006) measured smaller values of Dfrac (\u223c 10\u22122 ) from the\nratio N2 D+ /N2 H+ , which are nevertheless much larger than the\nD/H interstellar abundance. Despite these efforts, no systematic\nstudy of the [D/H] ratio across all stages of high-mass star formation has yet been carried out.\nIn this letter, we present the first study of the relation between deuterated fraction and evolution in a statistically significant sample of cores embedded in high-mass star forming regions spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages, from highmass starless core candidates (HMSCs) to high-mass protostellar\nobjects (HMPOs) and ultracompact (UC) HII regions (for a definition of these stages see e.g. Beuther et al 2007a). This goal\nwas achieved by observing rotational transitions of N2 H+ and\nN2 D+ with the IRAM-30m telescope. We chose these species\nbecause N2 D+ can be formed from N2 H+ only in the gas phase,\ntracing cold and dense regions more precisely than deuterated\nNH3 , which can also be formed on dust grains (e.g. Aikawa et\nal. 2005) and then evaporates by heating from nearby active starformation. Even though the observations are obtained with low\nangular resolution, the objects observed in the survey were carefully selected to limit as much as possible any emission arising\nfrom adjacent objects.\n\n2. Source selection and observations\nThe source list is in Table A-1, where we give the source coordinates, the distance, the bolometric luminosity, and the reference papers. We observed 27 molecular cores divided into: ten\nHMSCs, ten HMPOs, and seven UC HII regions. The source\ncoordinates were centred towards either (interferometric) infrared/millimeter/centimeter continuum peaks or high-density\ngas tracer peaks (NH3 with VLA, N2 H+ with CARMA or PdBI)\nidentified in images with angular resolutions comparable to or\nbetter than 6\u2032\u2032 , either from the literature or from observations\nnot yet published. In general, we rejected objects whose emission peaks were separated by less than \u223c 8\u2032\u2032 from another peak\nof a dense molecular gas tracer. This selection criterion was\nadopted to avoid or limit as much as possible the presence of\nmultiple cores within the IRAM-30m beam(s). The evolutionary stage of each source was established based on a collection\nof evidence: HMSCs are massive cores embedded in infrared\ndark-clouds or other massive star forming regions not associated\nwith indicators of ongoing star formation (embedded infrared\nsources, outflows, masers); HMPOs are associated with interferometric powerful outflows, and/or infrared sources, and/or faint\n(S \u03bd at 3.6 cm < 1mJy) radio continuum emission likely tracing a\nradio-jet; and UC HIIs must be associated with a stronger radiocontinuum (S \u03bd at 3.6 cm \u2265 1 mJy) that probably traces gas photoionised by a young massive star. We did not include evolved\nHII regions that have already dissipated the associated molecular core. We also limited the sample to sources at distances of\n2\n\nless than \u223c 5 kpc. We stress that the three categories must be\nregarded with caution because it can be difficult to determine\nthe relative evolutionary stage. This caveat applies especially to\nHMPOs and UC HII regions, whose evolutionary distinction is\nnot always a clear cut (see e.g. Beuther et al. 2007a). Among\nthe HMSCs, three sources (AFGL5142- EC, 05358-mm3, and\nI22134-G) have been defined as \"warm\" in Table A-1: we explain the peculiarity of these sources in Sect. 3. The observations\nof the 27 cores listed in Table A-1 were carried out with the\nIRAM-30m telescope in two main observing runs (February 2\nto 4, June 19 to 21, 2010), and several additional hours allocated\nduring three Herapool weeks (December 2009, January 2010,\nand November 2010). We observed the N2 H+ (3\u20132), N2 H+ (1\u2013\n0), and N2 D+ (2\u20131) transitions. The main observational parameters of these lines are given in Table A-2. The observations were\nmade in wobbler\u2013switching mode. Pointing was checked every\nhour. The data were calibrated with the chopper wheel technique\n(see Kutner & Ulich 1981), with a calibration uncertainty of\n\u223c 20 \u2212 30%. The spectra were obtained in antenna temperature\nunits, T A\u2217 , and then converted to main beam brightness temperature, T MB , via the relation T A\u2217 = T MB \u03b7MB , where \u03b7MB = Beff /Feff\nis 0.74 for N2 D+ (2\u20131), 0.53 for N2 H+ (3\u20132) and 0.88 for N2 H+\n(1\u20130) lines, respectively. All observed transitions possess hyperfine structure. To take this into account, we fitted the lines using METHOD HFS of the CLASS program, which is part of the\nGILDAS software1 developed at the IRAM and the Observatoire\nde Grenoble. This method assumes that all the hyperfine components have the same excitation temperature and width, and that\ntheir separation is fixed to the laboratory value. The method also\nprovides an estimate of the optical depth of the line, based on\nthe intensity ratio of the different hyperfine components. For the\nfaintest N2 D+ lines, for which the hfs method gives poor results,\nthe lines were fitted assuming a Gaussian shape.\n\n3. Results and discussion: is deuteration an\nevolutionary indicator of massive star formation?\nThe spectra of N2 D+ (2\u20131) and N2 H+ (3\u20132) for all sources detected in N2 D+ are shown in Figures B-1 \u2013 B-6. We detected\nN2 H+ (3\u20132) emission in all sources. We also found a remarkably\nhigh detection rate in the N2 D+ (2\u20131) line: 100% in HMSCs,\n64% in HMPOs, and 100% in UC HII regions. Such a high detection rate indicates that deuterated gas is present at every stage\nof the massive star and star cluster formation process, even in\nthe surroundings of UC HII regions where the gas is expected\nto be hotter and more chemically evolved. Even though for 12\nsources we also observed the N2 H+ (1\u20130) transition, we always computed the column density of N2 H+ and the deuterated\nfraction from the (3\u20132) line given its smaller telescope beam,\nto limit the contribution of nearby sources as much as possible. An overall presentation of the data obtained, and a deeper\nanalysis of all physical parameters, will be given in a forthcoming paper. We derived the N2 H+ and N2 D+ column densities, N(N2 H+ ) and N(N2 D+ ), from the line integrated intensity following the method described in the appendix of Caselli\net al. (2002b). Thanks to the selection criteria for our sources,\nfor which interferometric maps of dense gas are available for\nmost of the regions, a first estimate of the filling factor could be\ncomputed. However, because maps of the two transitions used\nto derive Dfrac have not yet been performed (except for I22134VLA1), the source size was determined from interferometric\n1\nThe\nGILDAS\nsoftware\nhttp://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS\n\nis\n\navailable\n\nat\n\n\fFontani et al.: Deuteration in massive-star formation\n\nmeasurements of NH3 (2,2). This assumption seems reasonable\nbecause this line traces gas with physical conditions similar to\nthose of N2 H+ (3\u20132) and N2 D+ (2\u20131). To take into account the\npossible effects of the evolutionary stage on the source size, we\nalso computed an average diameter for each evolutionary group.\nThis turns out to be: 6.5\u2032\u2032 for HMSCs, 4.1\u2032\u2032 for HMPOs, and\n5.5\u2032\u2032 for UC HIIs (Busquet 2010, Busquet et al. 2011, S\u00e1nchezMonge 2011, Palau et al. 2007, 2010). We stress that these angular diameters are consistent with the (few) N2 H+ and N2 D+\ninterferometric observations published to date (e.g. see the case\nof IRAS 05345+3157, Fontani et al. 2008). The N2 H+ and N2 D+\ncolumn densities, their ratio (Dfrac ), as well as the line parameters used in the derivation of the column densities, are listed in\nTable A-3.\nThe method assumes a constant excitation temperature,\nT ex . For the N2 H+ lines, T ex was derived directly from the\nparameters given by the hyperfine fitting procedure corrected\nfor the filling factor (see the CLASS user manual for details:\nhttp://iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/class-html/class.html).\nThe procedure, however, cannot provide good estimates for\noptically thin transitions or transitions with opacity (\u03c4) not\nwell-constrained (e.g. with relative uncertainty larger than\n30%). For these, we were obliged to assume a value for T ex (for\ndetails, see the notes of Table A-3). For the N2 D+ (2\u20131) lines we\nwere unable to derive T ex from the fitting procedure for almost\nall sources because \u03c4 is either too small or too uncertain. In 3\ncases only was the optical depth of the N2 D+ (2\u20131) transition\nwell-determined, and so is T ex : in two of these objects we\nfound a close agreement between the estimates derived from\nthe N2 D+ (2\u20131) and the N2 H+ (3\u20132) transitions. Therefore, the\nN2 D+ column density of each source was computed assuming\nthe same T ex as for N2 H+ . Since N2 D+ (2\u20131) and N2 H+ (3\u20132)\nhave similar critical densities and we measure similar T ex for\nboth transitions, the two lines approximately trace similar\nmaterial, so that computing Dfrac using them is a reasonable\napproach. The N2 H+ column densities are on average of the\norder of 1013\u221214 cm\u22122 , and the N2 D+ column densities are of\norder 1012\u221213 cm\u22122 . Both values are consistent with similar\nobservations towards massive star forming regions (e.g. Fontani\net al. 2006). The measured T ex corrected for filling factor are\nbetween \u223c 7 and \u223c 50 K and agree, on average, with the kinetic\ntemperatures measured from ammonia, except for the colder\nHMSCs for which they are a factor of \u223c 2 lower.\nThe deuterated fraction for the three evolutionary groups\nis shown in Fig. 1, where we plot N(N2 D+ ) against N(N2 H+ ).\nThere is a statistically significant separation between the HMSC\ngroup, which has the highest average Dfrac (mean value \u223c 0.26,\n\u03c3 = 0.22), and the HMPOs and UC HII groups, which have similar average deuterated fraction: mean Dfrac = 0.037 (\u03c3 = 0.017)\nfor HMPOs, and mean Dfrac = 0.044 (\u03c3 = 0.024) for UC HII\nregions. Both are about an order of magnitude smaller than that\nassociated with HMSCs. A closer inspection of the data using\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test shows that the separation in Dfrac between the HMSC group and that including both\nHMPOs and UC HII regions is indeed statistically significant:\nthe test shows that the probability of the distributions being the\nsame is very low (P \u223c 0.004). This is strong evidence that the\ntwo groups differ statistically. Therefore, massive cores without\nstars have larger abundances of N2 D+ than cores with already\nformed massive (proto-)stars or proto-clusters. The abundance\nof N2 D+ , however, seems to remain constant, within the uncertainties, after the formation of the protostellar object until the\nUC HII region phase. That Dfrac is of the order of \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3,\non average, in HMSCs, and then drops by an order of magnitude\n\nFig. 1. N2 D+ column density versus N2 H+ column density. Blue\nsymbols correspond to HMSCs (triangles: \"warm\" cores, see\ntext); green squares show HMPOs (open squares are upper limits); black asterisks correspond to UC HII regions. The two lines\nindicate the average values of Dfrac for the HMSC group (i.e.\n0.26) and that of both the HMPO and UC HII groups (i.e. 0.04).\n\nFig. 2. Deuterated fraction, Dfrac = N(N2 D+ )/N(N2 H+ ), as a\nfunction of several parameters: kinetic temperature (a), N(N2 H+ )\n(b), N2 H+ (3\u20132) line width (c) and N2 D+ (2\u20131) line width (d).\nThe symbols have the same meaning as in Fig. 1. For some\nsources, the errorbars are not visible because they are smaller\nthan the symbol size. In panel (a), only the sources with temperature derived from VLA ammonia observations are plotted.\nafter the onset of star formation, indicates that the physical conditions acting on the abundance of deuterated species (i.e. density and temperature) evolve similarly along both the low- and\nhigh-mass star formation processes (see e.g. Crapsi et al. 2005\nand Emprechtinger et al. 2009).\nAnother interesting aspect emerging from Fig. 1 is that the\nthree HMSCs defined as \"warm\" in Table A-1 (AFGL5142-EC,\n05358-mm3, and I22134-G, marked as triangles in the figure)\nhave Dfrac almost an order of magnitude smaller than the others.\nThese differ from the rest of the sub-sample of HMSCs because\nthey have temperatures T k > 20 K (see Table A-3 and panel\n(a) in Fig. 2). High angular resolution studies indicate that they\ncould be externally heated (Zhang et al. 2002, Busquet 2010,\nS\u00e1nchez-Monge 2011), so that they are likely to be perturbed\n3\n\n\fFontani et al.: Deuteration in massive-star formation\n\nby nearby star formation and we expect their properties to be\ndifferent from those of the other, more quiescent cores. An anticorrelation between Dfrac and the distance to heating sources\nsuch as embedded protostars was found in the cluster-forming\nOphiuchus-B clump by Friesen et al (2010). Our study tends to\nconfirm the Friesen et al.'s finding, even though the poor statistics does not allow us to drive firm conclusions. We also point\nout that the four cores selected from the Butler & Tan (2009)\nwork (G034-G2, G034-F1, G034-F2, G028-C1) have the highest values of all measured Dfrac and lie in infrared-dark regions,\naway from active star formation. These four cores are hence very\nsimilar to the prototype low-mass 'pre-stellar cores' (e.g. L1544,\nL694\u20132, see Crapsi et al. 2005) and we propose that these are\ngood 'massive pre\u2013stellar core' candidates.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot Dfrac as a function of several parameters: the kinetic temperature, the N2 H+ column density, and the\nline widths derived from both N2 H+ and N2 D+ . To search for\npossible (anti-)correlations between these parameters, we performed two statistical tests: the Kendall's \u03c4 and the Spearman's\n\u03c1 rank correlation tests 2 . For T k , the tests were applied to all\nsources in our survey with gas temperature derived from VLA\ninterferometric ammonia observations (see Table A-3). As it can\nbe inferred from panel (a) of Fig. 2, Dfrac and T k are slightly\nanti-correlated (\u03c4 = \u22120.38, \u03c1= \u22120.50), and Dfrac is also anticorrelated with the N2 H+ column density (\u03c4 = \u22120.43, \u03c1= \u22120.60,\npanel (b) in Fig. 2). We also find a very faint anticorrelation between Dfrac and the N2 H+ line width (\u03c4 = \u22120.17, \u03c1 = \u22120.23) and\nbetween Dfrac and the N2 D+ line width (\u03c4 = \u22120.25, \u03c1 = \u22120.35)\n(panels (c) and (d) in in Fig. 2, respectively). In particular, this\nlatter is difficult to trust being affected by large uncertainties in\nthe N2 D+ line widths. Emprechtinger et al. (2009) suggested that\nin low-mass star forming cores the deuteration is higher in colder\nand more quiescent cores, according to the predictions of theoretical models. A similar trend was found also in a small sample\nof seven massive star-forming clumps by Fontani et al. (2006)\nincluding both HMPOs and UC HII regions but not HMSCs.\nThat the warmer sources have lower Dfrac is not surprising and\ncan be explained by the CO freeze-out and the chemical reactions leading to the enhancement of deuterium abundance being strongly depressed when the temperature increases (Caselli\net al. 2008). The lack of correlation between deuterated fraction and line widths tells us that the deuterium fractionation process is independent of the gas turbulence. This result agrees with\nhigh-angular resolution observations of cluster-forming regions\n(Fontani et al. 2009, Busquet et al. 2010), but given the large uncertainties (especially on the N2 D+ line widths), the conclusions\nmust be interpreted with caution. We speculate that the anticorrelation between Dfrac and N(N2 H+ ) could indicate that, assuming\nthat Dfrac decreases in the protostellar phase, the N2 H+ column\ndensity increases during the younger and most embedded period\nof the protostellar phase, as suggested by Busquet (2010) for a\ndifferent sample of sources.\nIn summary, our findings indicate that the physical conditions acting on the abundance of deuterated species (i.e. density and temperature) evolve similarly during both the low- and\nhigh-mass star formation process. To confirm this, several questions however need to be answered: in HMSCs, do the N2 D+\nand N2 H+ emission peak at dust emission peak as in low-mass\npre\u2013stellar cores? What is the nature of the N2 D+ emission in\nevolved objects (HMPOs and UC HII regions)? Is the emission\nextended or fragmented into several condensations (as found in\nthe few massive star forming regions observed with interferom2\n\n4\n\n(http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/nonparametric-statistics/ )\n\neters)? To answer these questions, higher angular resolution observations are necessary. On the theoretical side, we also need\nto investigate this proposed evolutionary sequence using astrochemical models.\nAcknowledgments.

(\u2020) T ex associated with uncertainties are calculated from the data, the others are assumed as explained in the footnotes; (\u2020\u2020) T k are derived from ammonia rotation temperatures following Tafalla\net al. 2004; (a) T ex \u223c1/2 T k , based on the results derived in this work for the HMSCs with well constrained T ex and T k , except the \"warm\" ones; (b) derived from the (3\u20132) line parameters obtained from\nthe hyperfine fitting procedure described in Sect. 2 and corrected for filling factor (see also the CLASS User Manual (http://iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/class-html/class.html); (c) average\nvalue for HMSCs; (d) T ex \u223c T k , based on the results derived in this work for the HMPOs with well constrained T ex and T k , and on the findings of Fontani et al. (2006) towards a sample of massive\ncores containing both HMPOs and UC HII regions; (e) average value for HMPOs; ( f ) average value for UCHIIs; (g) computed from the N2 H+ (1\u20130) line; (h) from VLA observations (Busquet 2010,\nS\u00e1nchez-Monge 2011, Palau personal comm.); (i) from Effelsberg observations (Pillai et al. 2006); ( j) from Effelsberg observations (Molinari et al. 1996); (k) from Effelsberg observations\nR (Sridharan\net al 2002); (l) from VLA observations (Fontani et al. 2004b); (m) from Effelsberg observations (Jijina et al. 1999); (\u2020\u2020\u2020) N2 H+ parameters are derived from the (1\u20130) line, for which T MB dv is the\nintegrated intensity of the isolated component (F1 F = 1, 0 \u2212 1, 1) appropriately normalised and assumed to be optically thin. However, because observations were obtained under very bad weather\nconditions, the Dfrac upper limit derived from this source is unreliable and we decided to exclude it in the following analysis.\n\n9\n\n\fFontani et al.: Deuteration in massive-star formation\n\nFig. B-1. Spectra of N2 D+ (2\u20131) and N2 H+ (3\u20132) obtained towards the sources classified as HMSCs.
