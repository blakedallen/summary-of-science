For this\nreason microscopic calculations are needed in order to investigate the details of the reaction\nmechanism and the underlying dynamics. Traditionally such studies could only be made for\nfew-body systems with A \u2264 3. The explicit calculation of final state wave functions constitutes the main limitation of standard approaches. On the other hand these difficulties can be\navoided in the Lorentz Integral Transform (LIT) method [1], where only a bound-state-like\nproblem has to be solved although the full final state interaction (FSI) is rigorously taken\ninto account. First applications of the method were made for electromagnetic responses of\n4\n\nHe [2]. Enormous progress has also been achieved in the calculation of bound-state wave\n\nfunctions of systems with A > 4 (No Core Shell Model [3] and Effective Interaction Hyperspherical Harmonics (EIHH) approach [4]). The novel methods of LIT and EIHH combined\nwith the help of modern computational resources enabled us to carry out calculations of electromagnetic cross sections of nuclei with A = 6 [5, 6]. Therefore, systems with 4 < A < 12\nare now considered an interesting playground for establishing a bridge between few- and\nmany-body physics and especially for testing many-body approximations.\nIn this paper we present the first microscopic calculation of a photoabsorption reaction on\na nucleus with A=7, namely 7 Li. In this calculation we use as nucleon-nucleon interaction\nthe Argonne potential AV4' [7], which is a semirealistic central interaction that contains Sand P-wave forces. In recent work [6] we found that the P-wave interaction has a significant\ninfluence on the photodisintegration cross section of P-shell nuclei, like 6 He and 6 Li, and leads\nto a considerably better agreement with experimental data than a central S-wave interaction\nonly. Thus we have chosen this potential model for the present ab initio calculation of the\n7\n\nLi total photoabsorption cross section. The calculational procedure is described in detail\n\nin [5, 6]. In the following we will briefly review the main steps only.\nThe inclusive unpolarized response function R(\u03c9) is defined by the total photoabsorption\ncross section\n\u03c3(\u03c9) = 4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u03c9R(\u03c9) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the fine structure constant and \u03c9 the photon energy. In the LIT method [1]\none obtains R(\u03c9) from the inversion of the integral transform\nZ\nR(\u03c9)\n.\nL(\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) = d\u03c9\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c3R )2 + \u03c3I2\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fIn the unretarded dipole approximation one has\nL(\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) =\n\nX 1\n1\n1\n2L0 + 1 2S0 + 1 L S \u03c3I\nM0 ,M0\n\n\u00d7 Im{h\u03a80 (M0L , M0S )|D\u0302z\u2020\n\n1\nD\u0302z |\u03a80 (M0L , M0S )i},\nH \u2212 \u03c3R \u2212 i\u03c3I\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D\u0302z denotes the dipole operator, H the nuclear Hamiltonian, and L0 and S0 are the\nangular momentum and spin of the ground state |\u03a80 (M0L , M0S )i, with projections M0L and\nM0S , respectively (since we work with central forces, L0 and S0 are good quantum numbers).\nThe transform L(\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) is evaluated by inserting a complete set of projection operators\nP\nP\nL\nS\nL\nS\nz\n|\u03a8\n(M\n,\nM\n)ih\u03a8\n(M\n,\nM\n)|\n\u2261\nL\nS\nC\nC\nC,M ,M\nC,M L ,M S P\u0302C,M L ,M S , where C = {L, S, T, T , \u03c0}\nstands for the quantum numbers characterizing the channels (angular momentum, spin,\n\nisospin and its projection, and parity, respectively), M L and M S are third components of\nangular momentum and spin. In the sum only the channels allowed by the dipole selection\nrules need to be considered and since the dipole operator does not depend on spin, we do not\nneed to average over the initial spin projections (M0S ), neither to sum over M S . Therefore\none obtains\nL(\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) =\n\n1\n1 X\n1\n|h\u03a8C |D\u0302z |\u03a80 i|2 Im{h\u03a8C |\n|\u03a8C i},\n2L0 + 1 \u03c3I C\nH \u2212 \u03c3R \u2212 i\u03c3I\n\nwhere\n|\u03a8C i = q\n\nP\u0302C D\u0302z |\u03a80 i\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nh\u03a80 |D\u0302z P\u0302C D\u0302z |\u03a80 i\n\nTo simplify the notation, in the last two equations we have also omitted the dependences\non M L and M0L , as will be done in the following.\nIn order to use the Lanczos algorithm (see Ref. [10]) it is convenient to write L(\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) =\nP\n\nC\n\nNC2 FC , where NC is connected to the norm of P\u0302C D\u0302z |\u03a80 i,\nNC2 =\n\nX\nX\n1\n1\n|h\u03a8C |D\u0302z |\u03a80 i|2 =\nh\u03a80 |D\u0302z P\u0302C D\u0302z |\u03a80 i\n2L0 + 1 L L\n2L0 + 1 L L\n\n(5)\n\n1\n1\nIm{h\u03a8C |\n|\u03a8C i}\n\u03c3I\nH \u2212 \u03c3R \u2212 i\u03c3I\n\n(6)\n\nM ,M0\n\nM ,M0\n\nand\nFC =\n\n3\n\n\fTABLE I: Good quantum numbers for the channels |\u03a8C i allowed by the dipole selections rules.\n|\u03a81 i\n\n|\u03a82 i\n\n|\u03a83 i\n\n|\u03a84 i\n\n|\u03a85 i\n\n|\u03a86 i\n\nL\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nS\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\nT\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n2\n\nTz\n\n\u2212 12\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2212 12\n\n\u2212 21\n\nis evaluated as continuous fraction via the Lanczos coefficients. This means that the LIT of\nthe total response is the sum of the Lorentz transforms of the individual channels\nL(\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) =\n\nX\n\nLC (\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nC\n\nwhere for every channel one has LC (\u03c3R , \u03c3I ) = NC2 FC .\nIn the case of 7 Li one has total angular momentum and parity J \u03c0 =\nT0 =\n\n1\n2\n\n3\u2212\n2\n\nand isospin\n\nwith projection T0z = \u2212 12 . Using central forces, one has ground state orbital angular\n\nmomentum L0 = 1 and spin S0 = 21 . There are six different channels allowed by the dipole\nselection rules corresponding to angular momentum L = L0 \u2212 1, L0 , L0 + 1, spin S = S0 and\nisospin T = T0 , T0 + 1 with isospin projection conserved T z = T0z . In Table I we show the\ngood quantum numbers of these channels.\nFor every channel the LIT is calculated by expanding |\u03a80 i and |\u03a8C i in terms of the 7body anti-symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics (HH) up to a maximum HH hyperangular\n0\nmomentum [9], i.e. Kmax\nfor the ground state |\u03a80 i and Kmax for the channels |\u03a8C i. The\n\nconvergence of the HH expansion is improved by using the EIHH approach. Our procedure\n0\nconsists in fixing first Kmax\nsuch that convergence for the binding energy is reached, and\n\nthen we study the behavior of the LIT with increasing Kmax . As already pointed out in [6],\nthe rate of convergence for a potential that includes a central P-wave interaction, like the\nAV4', can be slower than that of a purely central S-wave force. Nevertheless, in the case of\n7\n\nLi we have obtained a satisfactory convergence in terms of hyperangular momentum, both\n\nfor ground state energy and LIT. For the ground state of 7 Li good convergence is reached\n0\n0\nwith Kmax\n= 9 with a binding energy of 45.28 MeV. Further increase to Kmax\n= 11 leads\n\nonly to a small change of the binding energy by 0.05 MeV. Because of the dipole selection\nrule K = K0 \u00b1 1 between states with hyperangular momenta K and K0 , an expansion of\n4\n\n\fTABLE II: Reduction of basis states for channel C = 3 for Kmax = 10.

Thus it is expected that for\n0\n0\nsufficiently high Kmax\na further increase of Kmax beyond Kmax\n+ 1 will not result in a\n0\nsignificant change. In this case a check of the convergence with respect to Kmax\nonly will\n\nbe sufficient.\nIn the present work, the best calculation of the LIT corresponds to a final state with\nKmax = 10. In this case the number of HH-basis states to be included becomes quite large,\nespecially for the channels with LC = 1 and 2. For example, already for channel C = 3\nand Kmax = 10 one has 6348 hyperspherical states. This number has to be multiplied by\nthe number of hyperradial states, about 30, to obtain the total number of states needed\nin the expansion. Therefore, it is desirable to discard those HH states which give only\nnegligible contributions to the LIT. To this end we have studied the importance of the HH\nstates according to their spatial symmetry and found that quite a few of them can be safely\nneglected (see Table II). We have checked this approximation by performing calculations\nwith the complete set of states for lower values of Kmax (6 and 8) and compared the results\nwith those using a truncated set. Whenever the differences between results with the reduced\nand the full basis were negligible (below 0.5%) we concluded that the omitted states were\nnegligible also for higher Kmax . In this way we accomplished for Kmax = 10 a sizable\nreduction from N = 190 440 to N = 111 900 basis functions. In an analogous way we carried\nout the calculations for all the other channels. The estimated error introduced by these\ntruncations is of the order of 0.5%.\nWe are also able to check the error introduced by the symmetry truncation in a second\nway. In fact a good check of the quality of the calculation is obtained by considering the\n\n5\n\n\fsum over the norms NC2 defined in (5). Using completeness one finds\nX\nC\n\nNc2 =\n\n1\n2L0 + 1\n\nX\n\n|h\u03a8C |D\u0302z |\u03a80 i|2 =\n\nC,M L ,M0L\n\nX\n1\nh\u03a80 |D\u0302z\u2020 D\u0302z |\u03a80 i ,\n2L0 + 1 L\n\n(8)\n\nM0\n\nwhere the last expression is nothing else than the mean expectation value of the operator\nD\u0302z\u2020 D\u0302z in the ground state, that can be easily calculated (see Ref. [5]). With respect to\n0\nEq. (8) we obtained 1.877 [fm2 ] for the ground state expectation value with Kmax\n= 9, while\n\nusing a symmetry truncated expansion for |\u03a8C i up to Kmax = 10 we get 1.871 [fm2 ]. The\nsmall difference of 0.3% reflects the small error introduced by the symmetry truncation.\n\n(%)\n\n15\n0\n\nR\n\n0\n\nK max (+)\n\n(a)\n\nC=6\n\n30\n\n\u221215\nK0max 9\n7\n5\n\n\u221230\n\u221245\n0\n15\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n(b)\n\nC=6\n\nR\n\n0\n\nK max (\u2212)\n\n(%)\n\n0\n\u221215\n0\n\n\u221230\n\nK max\n\n\u221245\n\n11\n9\n7\n\n\u221260\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nK0\n\nFIG. 1: Upper panel (a): Relative change RC max\nK0\n\nLower panel (b): RC max\n\n(\u2212)\n\n60\n\n\u03c3R [MeV]\n\n(+)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nfor the LIT of channel C=6 (\u03c3I = 10 MeV).\n\nfor the same channel (see text for details).\n\nAs next point we address the quality of convergence of the LIT with respect to the HH\nK0\n\nexpansion. For this reason, we first introduce the notation LC max\n\n(\u00b1)\n\nfor the LIT calculated\n\n0\n\u00b1\n0\n\u00b1 1 for |\u03a8C i,\nwith an expansion up to Kmax\nfor the ground state and up to Kmax\n= Kmax\n\n6\n\n\fK0\n\nrespectively. That means LC max\n\n(+)\n\nrepresents the LIT of channel C calculated with a max-\n\nimal hyperangular momentum for those states which can be reached by a dipole transition\nK0\n\nfrom the ground state, whereas for LC max\n\n(\u2212)\n\nthe expansion of channel C is taken up to one\n\nstep below this value. Then we define\nK 0 (\u00b1)\nRC max\nK0\n\nwhere RC max\n\n(+)\n\nK0\n\n=\n\nLC max\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n0\n(Kmax\n\u22122)(+)\n\n\u2212 LC\nK0\n\nLC max\n\n\u00d7 100,\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n(9)\n\n0\nrepresents the relative percentage change for increasing Kmax\nby 2 together\nK0\n\nwith a corresponding increase of Kmax while RC max\n\n(\u2212)\n\nrepresents the relative change for\n\n0\nincreasing Kmax\nby 2 but keeping Kmax fixed.\nK0\n\nIn Fig. 1 (a) we show the convergence pattern of RC max\n\n(+)\n\nfor one of the more important\n\n0\nof the six C channels, namely C = 6. One readily sees that increasing Kmax\nresults in a\nK0\n\nconsiderable reduction of R6 max\n\n(+)\n\n9(+)\n\n0\n. For example, changing Kmax\nfrom 7 to 9 yields a R6\n\nbetween 5 and 15 %, where the lower value refers to the region of the maximum of the\nLIT (compare Fig. 2), which however is still not negligible. It is very likely, that a further\n0\nincrease to Kmax\n= 11 would lead to a significant improvement of the convergence. Although\n0\nthe calculation of the ground state for Kmax\n= 11 can be performed, the corresponding\n\ncalculation of the final state with Kmax = 12 is beyond our present technical capabilities\n11(\u2212)\n\nwhereas it can be done for Kmax = 10, i.e. LC\n\ncan be calculated. Thus the question now\n9(+)\n\nis, how much is the convergence improved in going from LC\n0\nKmax\n(\u2212)\n\nshow RC\nK0\n\nRC max\n\n(\u2212)\n\n11(\u2212)\n\nto LC\n\n. To this end we\n\n0\n= 7, 9, 11. Again one notes a considerable decrease of\nin Fig. 1 (b) for Kmax\n\n0\n0\nwith increasing Kmax\nand for the highest value Kmax\n= 11 of the order of 5 % in\n\nthe region \u03c3R \u2264 60 MeV where the LIT is more sizable. Furthermore, comparing panels (a)\nK0\n\n0\nthe relative change R6 max\nand (b) of Fig. 1 one can see that for a given Kmax\n0\nKmax\n(\u2212)\n\nthan that of R6\n\n11(+)\n\n. Therefore, we expect that a further increase to L6\n9(+)\n\na relative change with respect to L6\n\n(+)\n\nis smaller\n\nwould lead to\n\nsmaller than 5%. Since the other channels behave\n\nsimilarly, we estimate a total uncertainty of about 5%.\nNow we turn to the results for photodisintegration. In order to obtain the total photoabsorption cross section \u03c3(\u03c9), we first invert the LITs of the response functions for the\nvarious channels (for details see [11]). Then one obtains the contribution to the cross section of each channel using the relation (1). Summing up all contributions finally yields the\ntotal cross section \u03c3(\u03c9). In Fig. 2 we show both the calculated total cross section and the\ncontributions of the separate channels.

Panel (c) shows again the T = 1/2 and T = 3/2 contributions and the total cross\nsection.\n\nassociated with the reaction 7 Li +\u03b3 \u2192 4 He +t with a threshold of 2.47 MeV (the theoretical\nthreshold obtained with the AV4' potential is 4.70 MeV), whereas the lowest open T =\n\n3\n2\n\nchannel corresponds to 7 Li +\u03b3 \u2192 6 He + p, whose threshold is 9.975 MeV (the theoretical\nvalue is 12.41 MeV). In Fig. 2 the theoretical thresholds have been used.\nFor the T = 1/2-channels in Fig. 2 (a) one readily sees that by far the largest contribution\ncomes from channel 3 rising steeply above threshold, reaching a maximum around 17 MeV\n8\n\n\f4\n\nAV4'\nAhrens et al\n\n7\n\nLi\n\n\u03c3 [mb]\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 3: Comparison of the theoretical photoabsorption cross section calculated with AV4' potential\nwith experimental data from [12].\n\nand falling off only slowly. Channel 5 is the next in importance rising only slowly above\n10 MeV with a maximum near 33 MeV and becoming then comparable in size to channel\n3. Only in the very near threshold region channel 1 is dominant but then becomes much\nsmaller than the other two channels. In Fig. 2 (b) the T = 3/2 channels have two dominant\ncontributions, almost similar in size. Channel 4 is slightly larger showing also a steep rise at\nthreshold and slow fall-off with a maximum near 23 MeV whereas the second in importance,\nchannel 6, shows a slow rise and a peak around 40 MeV. Compared to these two channels,\nthe remaining channel 2 appears quite marginal. In view of the two maxima of almost\nequal height with a separation by about 17 MeV the total T = 3/2-contribution exhibits a\nbroader distribution than the T = 1/2-contribution with a shoulder on the low-energy side.\nThe maxima of both contributions have about the same size but are separated by about\n20 MeV. Thus, the resulting total cross section in Fig. 2 (c) shows also a broad distribution\nwith a steep rise right above threshold, a slight shoulder above the maximum and a slow\nfall-off at higher energies.\nThis characteristic behavior is indeed exhibited by the experimental data on 7 Li in Fig. 3\nwhere we show a comparison of the theoretical result to experimental data from [12]. Note\nthat the theoretical cross section is shifted here from the theoretical threshold to the experimental one. One readily notes that the gross properties of the data, steep rise, broad\nmaximum and slow fall off, are very well reproduced quantitatively over the whole energy\n9\n\n\fregion by the theory. It is worthwhile to emphasize that this result is based on an ab initio\ncalculation in which the complicated final state interaction of the 7N-system is rigorously\ntaken into account by application of the LIT method. No adjustable parameters were used,\nthe sole ingredient being the AV4' NN potential model. It remains to be seen whether the\nslight variation of the data near and above the maximum will also be found in an experiment with improved accuracy. Therefore, a new measurement of the total cross section with\na higher precision would be very desirable. In particular, this could clarify the question\nwhether a simple semi-realistic potential like the AV4' model is sufficient for an accurate\ntheoretical description of this reaction or whether a more realistic nuclear force including a\n3N-force is needed.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA large part of the numerical calculations have been performed at the computer centre\nCINECA (Bologna).
