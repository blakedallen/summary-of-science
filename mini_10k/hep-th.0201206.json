Introduction\nRecently a lot of attention is given to the studies of gauged and massive supergravity\ntheories for the reason that these theories play a significant role in AdS/CFT analysis [1] and also because they might be useful in string phenomenology [2]. Massive\nsupergravities are regarded as closed counterparts of gauged supergravities. In massive theories some of the vector or tensor fields become massive upon eating other\nfields in the spectrum, analogous to a Higgs type mechanism. In this procedure the\ntotal degrees of freedom remain unaltered and so do the number of supercharges,\nhowever it turns out that we need to sacrifice some of the global symmetries, like\ndualities. But it is not always so, certain fraction of these symmetries, at least the\nperturbative ones, could be restored. This is the goal of our investigation in this\npaper to look for these unbroken global symmetries.\nA well studied and unique example of a massive theory of gravity is the massive\ntype IIA supergravity in ten dimensions constructed by Romans [3]. In string theory,\nmassive supergravities can typically be constructed through a Scherk-Schwarz reduction [4], in which some field strength dA(p) is given a non-trivial background value\n(flux) along the compact directions [5]. Established criterion for turning on such\nbackground fluxes with consistency is that the potential A(p) appears only through\nits field strength dA(p) in the action, or equivalently in the field equations. There\nhas been several works along these lines in recent past [5\u201317], for more latest works\nsee [18\u201323].\nAmongst massive theories, massive type IIA supergravities can be easily characterised solely by there field content in which the NS-NS 2-rank tensor field is\nmassive. In D < 10 massive type IIA theories, in which tensor fields are massive,\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fcan also be obtained through generalised K3 and toroidal compactifications of the ordinary (massless) type IIA supergravities with Ramond-Ramond (RR) fluxes turned\non [18, 21]. On the other hand massive heterotic supergravities with massive 1-form\nfields could be obtained by generalised Kaluza-Klein compactification [10, 16]. Thus\nthere is no way out we can make a connection between massive type IIA theories and\nmassive heterotic strings because different type of fields carry masses [18], though\nthere is a duality relationship in D = 6 involving ordinary type II and heterotic\nsupergravities, for review see [27]. Therfore unless there is a machenism by which\nwe can trade massive 2-rank tensor fields into a massive vector fields we cannot help\nus out. Fortunately there is such a relationship in four dimensions where a massive\ntensor field carries same degrees of freedom as a massive vector field carries [24]. So\nin four dimensions it would be possible to dualize a massive 2-rank tensor field into\nmassive 1-form field. Hence the study of massive theories in D = 4 is very crucial\nfor duality relationship between massive type IIA and heterotic strings. Though, we\nwill not show this duality relationship between massive tensors and massive vector\nfields explicitely, we shall be adopting an equivalent tool of compactifications and\nuse duality symmetries, which do this job implicitely.\n\nPaper is organized in the following way. We work out a generalized T 2 compactification of the six-dimensional massive type IIA supergravity [18] with RR\n2-form fluxes turned on. Our goal is to investigate the fate of the perturbative\nSL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) \u00d7 O(4, 20) duality symmetry. We then are interested in relating\nthis 6D N = 2 massive type IIA compactified on T 2 to the ordinary 6D N = 2 type\nIIA compactified on T 2 with fluxes and eventually relate it to heterotic string theory\ncompactified on T 4 . In section 2 we briefly recall 6D massive type IIA sugra and\nwork out its compactification on T 2 with RR fluxes. We discover that provided RR\n2-form fluxes are turned on the resulting four-dimensional theory can be presented in\na manifestly SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) \u00d7 O(4, 20) covariant form. In section 3 we provide\na mechanism to relate Romans theory compactified on K3 \u00d7 T 2 (with fluxes) to the\nordinary type IIA compactified on K3 \u00d7 T 2 (with fluxes) which is in turn related to\nheterotic strings. In section 4 we study the vacuum solutions of this massive type IIA\nsupergravity and relate them to the solutions of ordinary IIA by using the elements\nof duality group. We then use standard heterotic-type IIA duality in six dimensions\nto relate corresponding ordinary IIA vacua to heterotic solutions. Particularly the\nD8-brane solution is shown to correspond to a pure gravity heterotic vacua in ten\ndimensions which contains a domain-wall-type instanton line element. Thus perturbative duality symmetry relates the vacua of massive type IIA and ordinary type IIA\ntheories in six dimensions provided we have T 2 isometries. This property also allows\nus to further relate massive type IIA vacua to six-dimensional heterotic solutions.\nWe have summarized our results in the section 5.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f2. Toroidal compactification\nThe compactification of Romans type IIA supergravity [3] on K3 with RR fluxes\nwas provided in [18]. The resulting bosonic composition of 6D N = 2 massive type\nII theory is given by\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ h\n1 \u02c6\n1 a\n1\n\u22121 b\n\u22121\n\u22122\u03c6\u0302\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u2217\u02c6M\u0302ab\nF\u0302(2)\n\u2212 F\u0302(2)\nR\u0302 \u2217\u02c61 + 4 d\u03c6\u0302\u02c6\u2217d\u03c6\u0302 \u2212 \u0124(3) \u02c6\u2217\u0124(3) + T r dM\u0302 \u2217\u02c6dM\u0302\nS6 =\ne\n2\n8\n2\ni\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u22121 b\n\u2212 ma \u02c6\u2217M\u0302ab\n(2.1)\nm + B\u0302 F\u0302 a F\u0302a \u2212 B\u0302 2 ma F\u0302a + B\u0302 3 ma ma ,\n2\n2\n2\n3!\nwhere we have adopted the notation that every product of forms is understood as a\nwedge product.1 Here \u03c6\u0302 is the dilaton field, B\u0302(2) is NS-NS tensor field and \u00c2a (a =\n1, * * * , 24) are RR vector fields which form a vectorial representation of the duality\nsymmetry group O(4, 20). ma represents 24 mass (or flux) parameters which also\nform a vector of O(4, 20). The field strengths in the action (2.1) are given by\n\u0124(3) = d\u02c6B\u0302(2) ,\n\na\nF\u0302(2)\n= d\u02c6\u00c2a(1) + ma B\u0302(2) ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nThere are eighty scalar fields those parameterize O(4, 20)/O(4) \u00d7 O(20) coset matrix\nM\u0302 ab which satisfies\nM\u0302 T L M\u0302 = L,\n\nM\u0302 \u22121 = L M\u0302 L,\n\nM\u0302 T = M\u0302\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere L is O(4, 20) metric. Thus above six dimensional action has manifest O(4, 20)\ninvariance [18]. Once ma is vanishing, above action represents ordinary type IIA\ncompactified on K3.\nWe shall now work out the compactification of above theory on T 2 in presence\nof RR fluxes. To recall, T 2 compactification of Romans type IIA theory has been\nworked out in detail in [21], so we shall omit various fine details here.

Through these gauge invariaces, the vector fields Aru can eat the scalars ar and can become massive. Similarly\nthe tensor field B can eat one of the two vector fields Au and can become massive.\nHowever, this process of swellowing in of the fields will break the duality symmetry\nexplicitely.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f3. Massive IIA and heterotic strings\nAs we have seen in the previous section, the restoration of the T-duality symmetry\nof the massive II theories in D = 4 has been a direct consequence of our generalised\nflux-type ansatz in (2.8). This tells us that in this framework a wide class of type II\ntheories with various RR fluxes on K3 and/or T 2 , in fact, get unified. Specifically\nunder the SL(2, R) elements of this duality symmetry the K3-masses (or fluxes) and\nthe T 2 -fluxes are mixed up and rotated. We now discuss a particular case which is of\ninterest in the rest of this paper. Consider a compactification of 6D N = 2 massive\nII theory (2.1) on T 2 without fluxes (i.e. w\n~ = 0), the compactified four dimensional\nmassive theory will then be characterisd by the mass vector mu = (~0, m).\n~ 3 Similarly\nif we compactify a 6D N = 2 ordinary type IIA theory (that means m\n~ = 0 in (2.1))\non 2-torus with fluxes, the resulting four-dimensional theory will be chracterised by\na different mass vector mu = (\u2212w,\n~ ~0). These two four-dimensional theories obtained\nin two different ways can simply related by the following SL(2, R) element\n\u039b=\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn many ways this is analogous to the identification between 2-form RR flux and\nthe Romans' mass parameter when 10D massive IIA is compactified on T 2 and a\nordinary type IIA compactified on T 2 with RR flux [21]. Other elements of above\nSL(2, R) group mix two types of fluxes which could be used to generate new background configurations. In the rest of this paper our aim is to relate massive type IIA\nbackgrounds to heterotic string backgrounds.\nHaving achieved this relationship between 6D N = 2 massive IIA theory and\nthe ordinary 6D N = 2 ordinary type IIA, both compactified on 2-torus, former\nwithout fluxes and the latter with fluxes, it is now straight forward to achieve the\nheterotic connection via following six-dimensional S-duality relations between type\nIIA compactified on K3 and heterotic string theory compactified on T 4 [27]\n\u03c6het = \u2212\u03c6II ,\n\nhet\nII\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n= e\u2212\u03c6II g\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n\nMhet = MII ,\n\nhet\nII\nH(3)\n= e\u2212\u03c6II \u2217 H(3)\n.\n\n~ het = A\n~ II ,\nA\n(3.2)\n\nIn this approach Romans theory compactified on K3(f luxes) \u00d7 T 2 is mapped to\nthe ordinary type IIA compactified on K3 \u00d7 T 2 (f luxes) which in turn is related by\nduality (3.2) to heterotic string compacified on T 4 \u00d7 T 2 (f luxes). In the next section\nwe shall take an explicit examples of domain-wall solutions and display this duality\nchain.\n3\n\nHere ~0 reprsents 24-dimensional vector with zero entries.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f4. D8-brane vs heterotic instanton\nThe ten-dimensional massive IIA supergravity theory has D8-brane (domain-wall)\nsolutions which preserve sixteen supercharges [5]. In the string frame metric this\nsolution is given by\nds210 = H \u22121/2 (\u2212dt2 + dx21 + * * * + dx28 ) + H 1/2 dz 2 ,\n5\n2\u03c610 = \u2212 ln H,\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere H = 1 + m|z \u2212 z0 | is a harmonic function of only the transverse coordinate\nz and all other fields have vanishing background values, z0 refers to the location of\nthe domain-wall. We compactify this solution on K3 by wrapping four of its worldvolume directions, say x5 , ..., x8 . The corresponding six-dimensional domain-wall\nsolution of the action (2.1) can be written down as [18]\nd\u015d26 = H \u22121/2 (\u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 + dx23 + dx24 ) + H 1/2 dz 2 ,\n3\n2\u03c6\u03026 = \u2212 ln H , M\u0302 = diag(H \u22121 , 1, 1..., 1, 1, H) ,\n2\n\n(4.2)\n\nwith mass vector m\n~ = (0, ..., 0, m).4 Clearly this vacuum configuration corresponds\nto the situation when there is no background flux along K3. The solution (4.2) is\nleft with 8 unbroken supersymmetries. Further compactification of this on T 2 gives\nus a solution of the action (2.12)\nds24 = H \u22121/2 (\u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 ) + H 1/2 dz 2 ,\n2\u03c64 = \u2212 ln H , M = diag(H \u22121 , 1, 1..., 1, 1, H) ,\n1\n1\nm\n~ u = (~0, m),\n~\nM = diag(H \u2212 2 , H 2 ), N = I2 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nNow, by applying SL(2, R) transformations (2.16) on the fields in (4.3) the solutions with non-trivial R-R fluxes can be generated. Let us consider the specific case\nwhere SL(2, R) transformation is given by (3.1). Inserting \u039b and the configuration\n(4.3) in (2.16) we get\nu\n\nm\n~ =\n\n\u0012\n\n~0\nm\n~\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2032u\n\n\u2192m\n~ =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212m\n~\n~0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nM \u2192 M, N \u2192 N, M \u2192 M\u22121 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhile four-dimensional metric and the dilaton remain invariant. The transformed\nmass vector m\n~ \u2032u implies that the new configuration is a solution of a 6D ordinary\nIIA compactified on T 2 with 2-form fluxes given by w\n~ = (0, ...., 0, m). Lifting the\nrotated solution (4.4) to six dimensions, we get the following ordinary type IIA\n4\n\nThe last entry in the mass vector m\n~ represents the mass parameter of Romans theory.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fconfiguration (we write new fields with a prime)\n\u2032\n\nd\u015d62 = H \u22121/2 (\u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 ) + H 1/2 (dz 2 + dy12 + dy22 ) ,\n1\n~\n\u00c2\u2032 = w\n~ y[1 dy2] ,\n2\u03c6\u0302\u20326 = \u2212 ln H ,\n2\nM\u0302 \u2032 = M\u0302 = diag(H \u22121 , 1, 1..., 1, 1, H) .\n\n(4.5)\n\nThis is in accordance with our ansatz in (2.8) and corresponds to swiching on the flux.\nSince this solution is obtained by incorporating T-duality rotation (2.16) the number\nof preserved supersymmetries will remain unchanged. Thus by making an SL(2, R)\ntransformation we have transformed domain-wall solution (4.2) of 6D massive IIA\ntheory into a domain-wall solution (4.5) of 6D ordinary type IIA which is supported\nby a non-trivial 2-form flux. Thus, the four-dimensional perturbative duality interpolates between vacua of massive type IIA and ordinary type IIA. It is parallel to\nthe situation encountered in the case of massive type II duality in D = 8 [21].\nHeterotic instanton: Since ordinary type IIA theory on K3 is equivalent to heterotic\ntheory on T 4 , in order to relate solutions of 6D massive IIA theory to six dimensional heterotic string vacua we need first to map them to the vacua of ordinary IIA\nby using the SL(2, R) element (3.1) and then use the relations (3.2). Let us consider for definitness the configuration in eq.(4.5) which is already a 6D ordinary IIA\nbackground and can therefore be mapped to heterotic side using (3.2). After, some\nstraight forward calculation we get the following six-dimensional ordinary heterotic\nsolution (in string frame)\nds26,het = \u2212dt2 + dx21 + dx22 + H(dz 2 + dy12 + dy22) ,\n1\n2\u03c66,het = ln H , Mhet = MII = diag(H \u22121, 1, ..., 1, H) ,\n2\n~\nAhet = w\n~ y[1 dy2] , w\n~ = (0, ..., 0, m) ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere the harmonic function H = 1 + m|z \u2212 z0 |. Note that heterotic string theory\n~ het belongs to the vector\ncompactified on T 4 has the T-duality group O(4, 20) and A\nrepresentation of this group [25]. It could be easily seen that the vector field in (4.6)\ncorresponds to a constant field strength in y1 , y2 directions which are along T 2 . A\ncompactification of heterotic strings along these coordinates with such background\nfluxes gives rise to masses in four dimensions, see [10, 16]. On the other hand when\n(4.6) is oxidised to ten dimensions, as in ordinary toroidal cases, we obtain following\n10D heterotic vacua\n5\n\nds210,het = H \u22121 [d\u03c4 +\n\nX\nm\n(y1 dy2 \u2212 y2 dy1 )]2 + H(dz 2 + dy12 + dy22) \u2212 dt2 +\ndx2i ,\n2\ni=1\n(4.7)\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fwhere \u03c4 is one of the coordinates along T 4 on which heterotic string is compactified.\ny1 and y2 are also periodic but are along T 2 . This pure gravity heterotic vacua\npreserves only 8 supersymmetries and has the geometry which is a product of a 4dimensional Taub-NUT instanton, E 4, and a 6-dimensional Minkowski space, M6 .\nProperties of these Taub-NUT type instanton line element E 4 are discussed in detail\n[21, 28].\nThus D8-brane wrapped on K3 \u00d7 T 2 emerges from purely geometrical configuration of the heterotic strings such that it involves 'domain-wall-instanton' (4.7).\nCompare (4.7) with M-theory instanton which is also related via duality to the D8brane wrapped on T 2 \u00d7 S 1 and is given by [21]5\n6\n\nds211 = H \u22121 [dx11 +\n\nX\nm\n(y1 dy2 \u2212 y2 dy1 )]2 + H(dz 2 + dy12 + dy22) \u2212 dt2 +\ndx2i ,\n2\ni=1\n\nH = 1 + m|z \u2212 z0 | ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere x11 is the coordinate of 11-dimensional circle S 1 . This solution however preserves 16 supersymmetries [21]. This is quite consistent as Heterotic theory is obtained by orbifolding of M-theory. These triad of solutions (4.1), (4.7) and (4.8) thus\nrepresent the same duality web involving T ypeIIA \u2190\u2192 M \u2212 theory \u2190\u2192 Heterotic\nchain. It has been shown [21] that M-theory compactifications on M7 \u00d7E4 correspond\nto 10D massive IIA compactification on 2-torus. Here we have presented an evidence\nthat M-theory compactifications on Z2 orbifold of M7 \u00d7E4 should corresspond to heterotic compactification on M6 \u00d7 E4 .\n\n5. Summary\nTo summarize in this work we have studied the T 2 compactification of six-dimensional\nmassive type IIA theory [18] with Ramond-Ramond background fluxes corresponding\nto 2-form field strength. We have found that the resulting four-dimensional theory\nhas SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) \u00d7 O(4, 20) global symmetries, same as the perturbative\nduality symmetries which appear in ordinary compactifications. The mass and flux\nparameters transform under SL(2, R) accordingly. Thus the perturbative T-duality\nsurvives at the massive level, though in a different form that it requires appropriate\nmasses and fluxes to be switched on. Next we have shown that the elements of this\nduality symmetry relate Romans theory compactified on K3 \u00d7 T 2 (with RR fluxes\nalong K3) with ordinary type IIA compactified on K3 \u00d7 T 2 (with RR fluxes along\nthe T 2 ). This relationship between ordinary and massive IIA theories compactified\non K3 \u00d7 T 2 fluxes has led us to provide a heterotic string interpretation for massive\nIIA theory. As an example we have shown that the wrapped D8-brane solution of\n5\n\n11-dimensional solutions similar to (4.8) originally appear in [6, 8]. The line element in (4.8)\ndiffers only in the structure of the vector field from previous occasions.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fmassive type IIA turns out to be SL(2, R) dual of the solution of ordinary type IIA\ntheory with flux, which in turn is related to pure gravity vacua of heterotic string\ntheory which is a direct product of 6D Minkowski spacetime and a 4D Ricci-flat\ninstanton. The instanton line element is a domain-wall generalization of Taub-NUT\ninstantons [26]. We recall that in [21] we have shown that D8-brane are also related to\nthe compactifications of M-theory invloving such instantons and these solutions have\n16 supersymmetries intact. While the Heterotic solution (4.7) has only 8 supercharges\nintact. This is entirely consistent given the fact that heterotic strings are orbifolds\nof M-theory.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to J.
