We show that even most massive initial solar composition stars hardly form black\nholes with mass exceeding \u2243 100 M\u2299 .\n\narXiv:astro-ph/0610021v2 15 Oct 2006\n\nKeywords. stars: evolution, stars: mass-loss\n\nWe have calculated evolution of 60 to 1001 M\u2299 nonrotating solar metallicity stars from\nZAMS through core helium-burning stage. 1001 M\u2299 is the upper mass limit for ZAMS\nof solar metallicity stars obtained by us (in agreement with Ishii et al.(1999)). In the\nabsence of empirical data and the theory of mass-loss for very massive stars, we assumed\nthat \u0393-instability is responsible for mass loss and applied an ad hoc mass-loss law \u1e40 =\nL\n1\nv\u221e c (1\u2212L/LEdd )(\u03b1\u22121/2) . Here LEdd is Eddington luminosity in the outermost meshpoint of\nthe model. Parameter \u03b1 = 0.25 was chosen such that the stars with mass 60 to 120 M\u2299\nspend . 1% of their lifetime to the right of the Humphreys-Davidson limit in the HRdiagram. Computations were carried out by appropriately modified TWIN-version of\nEggleton(1971) code. Results are relevant to the evolution of the most massive stars in\nthe Galactic center clusters or (still hypothetical) descendants of runaway stellar collisions\nin young dense clusters that are thought to be progenitors of black-hole accretors in some\nultraluminous X-ray sources (see, e. g. Portegies Zwart et al.(2004)).\nMass-loss rates both for H- and He-rich stars that follow from above given expression\nfor \u1e40 are consistent with the limits implied for line-driven winds and with \u1e40 found for\nthe most massive stars, e. g., in Arches, Quintuplet, HeI-clusters in the Galactic center.\nStars under consideration form oxygen-neon cores with minor admixture of carbon and\nhave thin helium-carbon envelopes (Ys \u2248 0.2 \u2212 0.4). Initial-final mass relation obtained\nin calculations and the fate of stellar remnants (as roughly inferred from the model\ncalculations for helium stars, e. g. Heger & Woosley(2002)) are shown in the Figure.\nThese results suggest that the products of runaway stellar collisions hardly can produce\nblack holes with mass & 100 M\u2299.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author acknowledges P.P.
