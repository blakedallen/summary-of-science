INTRODUCTION\n\nElectrons confined to nanometer-sized regions in semiconductors or metals have\nbeen the subject of intense study for many years. The quantization of charge and energy\nresulting from the confinement makes such regions, or quantum dots, behave like\nartificial atoms [1]. With recent advances in techniques for synthesizing large numbers\nof metallic and semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), it is now possible to make large arrays\nof artificial atoms in which particle size, inter-particle separation and chemical\ncomposition are controlled [2]. This opens the possibility of creating artificial solids with\ntunable electrical and optical properties. For example, it has been demonstrated that a\nLangmuir film of silver NCs undergoes a metal-insulator transition as a function of the\nseparation between NCs in the array [3].\nSolids composed of metallic NCs have transport properties that are well described\nby a model of collective charge transport in disordered arrays [4]. Whereas the large\nnumber of conduction electrons in the metallic NCs provide substantial screening of\nlong-range Coulomb interactions between electrons on different NCs, semiconductor\nNCs make possible the study of artificial solids in which such long-range interactions are\nvery large. In these systems, transport measurements may show collective effects of\ncharge ordering recently proposed by Levitov et al. [5].\nSo far, transport measurements on arrays of colloidal CdSe NCs separated by\norganic capping molecules have shown that these artificial solids are surprisingly\ninsulating [6-8]. Long-range Coulomb interactions between charges on different NCs\nslow the dynamics of the injected electrons, an effect best described by an electron\n\n2\n\n\f(Coulomb) glass model [9]. The current decays over extremely long time scales in\nresponse to a voltage step, and there is no steady-state current [6,7].\nIn order to increase the electrical current through the CdSe NC solids, the\ntunneling of electrons between NCs must be enhanced. This can be achieved by\ndecreasing the physical separation and the height of the tunnel barriers between NCs in\nthe array. The inter-dot separation is originally set by the length of the organic capping\nmolecule [2]. One way to decrease the inter-dot separation, while keeping the NC size\nthe same, is to anneal the NC solid at temperatures well below the melting temperature of\nNC cores. This idea has been used to facilitate transport measurements of arrays of\ncobalt NCs [10].\nIn this paper, we describe the electrical transport measured over the temperature\nrange from 6 K to 250 K in three-dimensional close-packed arrays of organically capped\nCdSe NCs [2], as a function of annealing time and temperature. After the solids are\nannealed, three changes are observed. First, transmission electron micrographs (TEMs)\nconfirm that the separation between NCs decreases with annealing. Second, the optical\nabsorption spectrum changes: the excitonic peaks of the NC solids shift to lower energies\nand broaden with annealing. Both the TEM and the absorption data provide evidence\nthat dots remain distinct after annealing. Last, the electronic properties of the solid\nchange, and annealing results in greatly enhanced dark current and photocurrent. The\ndark current generally increases exponentially with voltage; we show fits to the form\nI \u2248 V/Ro e|V|/Vo, where V is the voltage across the array of dots, and Ro and Vo are\nconstants that depend on the properties of the array. We show that Ro and Vo both\ndecrease as the solid is annealed, which corresponds to the measured current increasing\n\n3\n\n\fby up to three orders of magnitude. Similar changes are observed in measurements of the\nphotocurent in annealed NC solids. This enhancement of the current cannot be explained\nby the observed decrease of inter-dot separation alone. Rather, it is likely that chemical\nchanges in the inter-dot organic material during annealing reduce the barrier height. Our\nresults suggest that controlled annealing can be a useful tool for improving the\nconduction properties of NC solids.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nWe have prepared nanocrystals with diameters D from D = 4.3 nm to D = 6.1 nm,\nwith the rms deviation \u03c3 \u2248 5%D measured from optical absorption [2]. The NCs are\ncapped by an organic molecule, tri-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) which creates a large\npotential barrier for electrons moving between the NCs (Eb ~ 1eV [8]), and whose length\ndefines the surface-to-surface separation d = (1.1 \u00b1 0.1) nm between nearest neighbor\nNCs [2]. Details of the nanocrystal synthesis may be found in Reference [2].\nFigure 1 is a schematic of the typical device geometry used to study electrical\nproperties of close-packed arrays of NCs, showing a film deposited on top of gold\nelectrodes. The devices consist of microfabricated Au/Ti electrodes, 0.11 \u03bcm thick and\n800 \u03bcm long, on insulating quartz substrates 0.5 mm thick. We have used separations\nbetween electrodes of L = 1 \u03bcm and L = 2 \u03bcm. Details of the device preparation are\ndescribed in References [7,8]. The NC solids are formed by depositing a colloidal NC\nsolution on the electrodes and the substrate and then drying it over several hours at room\ntemperature in a nitrogen atmosphere. Most of the electrical measurements presented\nhere correspond to a NC solid composed of approximately 109 TOPO-capped CdSe NCs\n\n4\n\n\fbetween gold electrodes L = 2 \u03bcm apart. The thickness of the solid is ~ 0.4 \u03bcm (~ 70\nmonolayers), with a length corresponding to ~300 NCs between the electrodes.\nFor transport measurements, the CdSe NC-solids are annealed in vacuum inside\nthe cryostat, up to temperatures Ta = 110 C. For Ta > 110 C, samples are annealed in a\nseparate system consisting of a hot plate in a forming gas atmosphere (95% nitrogen and\n5% hydrogen). They are then transferred back into the cryostat for electrical\nmeasurements. Unless otherwise noted, the annealing time is 15 min. in forming gas and\n\u2248 1 hr in vacuum (~10-6 torr). We have annealed one transport sample in forming gas at\nthese lower temperatures to ensure that its electrical transport properties are the same as\nfor those annealed in vacuum. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nmeasurements, samples are deposited on carbon grids and for absorption measurements,\nsamples are deposited on glass slides. Both are annealed in forming gas.\nElectrical transport measurements are performed in vacuum (p \u2248 10-6 torr) at\ntemperatures from T = 6 K to T = 250 K and at applied electric fields up to\nE = 2.5x108V/m. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a voltage V is applied across the electrodes and\ncurrent I is measured with a current amplifier. Control measurements on substrates\nwithout NCs ensure that substrate conduction is negligible up to T ~ 250 K. The current\ndetection limit in our measurements is ~ 5fA. A green light-emitting diode (LED) is\nmounted ~3 mm above the device in the cryostat. The peak wavelength of the LED is\n\u03bb \u2248 565 nm, and the power P \u2248 50 \u03bcW. This allows us to photo-excite NCs and to\nmeasure photocurrent as a function of V.\n\n5\n\n\fIII. RESULTS\n\nThe van der Waals attraction between NCs causes them to self-assemble into\nhexagonal close-packed arrays [2]. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images\nprovide direct evidence that annealing decreases the inter-dot separation in the NC solid.\nFigure 2 shows the transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) of arrays of CdSe NCs\nwith D \u2248 6.1 nm as deposited (Fig.2 (a)), and after annealing at 350 C (Fig.2 (b)) and at\n430 C (Fig.2 (c)). To estimate the average NC separation in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) we have\ncounted the number of NCs in the fixed sample area A = 63.5x63.5 nm2 shown in Fig. 2.\nThere are N \u2248 78 dots counted in this area before annealing, whereas there are N \u2248 94\ndots after annealing at 350C. From the TEM data, the NC sizes after annealing at 350 C\nappear unchanged. Under this assumption and since N \u221d A/(D+d)2 and d \u2248 1.1 nm [2]\nfor the unannealed sample, we estimate that the inter-dot separation is reduced to d ~ 0.5\nnm after annealing at 350 C. After heating at 430 C, the NCs are no longer distinct (Fig.\n2 (c)).\nIn addition to sample characterization with TEM, optical absorption\nmeasurements have been used to characterize the distribution of NC sizes and to probe\nthe coupling of NCs to their environment [2, 11]. Fig. 3 (a) shows the evolution of the\nabsorption spectrum for one array of D \u2248 4.9 nm TOPO-capped CdSe NCs as deposited\nand after annealing at Ta = 110 C, Ta = 300 C, and Ta = 350 C. In all the spectra, the\nmain peak corresponding to the size-dependent band gap is clearly visible. As the\nannealing temperature is increased, the absorption spectrum shifts to the red and the\npeaks broaden. The presence of clear size-dependent excitonic features in the spectra of\n\n6\n\n\fthe annealed solids is additional evidence that the dots are still distinct. After annealing\nwe observe an increased background in the absorption spectra, which has a long tail at\nlong wavelengths. We infer from its wavelength dependence that it arises from scattering\nin the film. There may also be contributions from absorption due to pyrolyzing the\norganic material.\nThe band-edge peak at \u03bb \u2248 587 nm (E = 2.11 eV) in the as-prepared film, shifts\nby \u2206E \u2248 \u2013 5 meV, \u2013 30 meV, and \u2013 40 meV, after annealing at Ta = 110 C, Ta = 300 C,\nand Ta = 350 C, respectively. For reference, the band-gap of bulk CdSe corresponds to\nE = 1.8 eV (\u03bb \u2248 690 nm) [12], whereas the peak after the 350 C anneal is at 2.07 eV.\nFig. 3 (b) shows the evolution of the absorption spectrum for one array of smaller,\nD \u2248 4.3 nm TOPO-capped CdSe dots as deposited and after annealing at Ta = 350 C for\nannealing times of t = 5, 10, 15 and 35 minutes. A subsequent annealing at Ta = 400 C\nfor t = 10 min. is also shown. Curves 2 to 5 in Fig. 3 (b), indicate that the effect of\nannealing for longer times at the same temperature (Ta = 350 C) is to increase the width\nof the peak while affecting its position only slightly. The band-edge peak, which is at\n\u03bb \u2248 566 nm (E \u2248 2.19 eV) before annealing, has shifted by \u2206E \u2248 \u2013 30 meV after\nannealing at Ta = 350 C for 5 min. After subsequent annealing at Ta = 350 C for longer\ntimes, the band-edge peak shifted only by \u2206E \u2248 \u2013 5 meV from curve 2 to curve 5. After\nannealing at Ta = 400 C, the peak has shifted by \u2206E \u2248 \u2013 290 meV to E = 1.9 eV, making\nit very close to the gap of bulk CdSe.\nFrom the TEM and absorption data, we have confidence that the dots are still\nphysically distinct after annealing, as long as Ta \u2264 350 C. We now describe how the\ntransport properties of the NC solids change upon annealing. Figure 4 shows typical\n\n7\n\n\fcurrent-voltage (I-V) curves of a NC solid on log-linear plots at T = 77 K. Measurements\nare shown both in the dark (Fig. 4 (a)) and with illumination from the LED (Fig. 4 (b)),\nfor the film as-deposited (labeled I), and after annealing at Ta = 110 C (II) and Ta = 300 C\n(III).\nWe first focus on the dark-current data of Fig. 4 (a). These clearly show the\nfollowing features: (i) a hysteresis in the I-V curves; (ii) an approximately exponential\nincrease of current with voltage, and (iii) an increased current through the solid after\nannealing. We next discuss these features in turn.\n(i) The hysteresis is such that the measured current is larger as the voltage sweeps\nup, from |V| = 0 to 500 V. This hysteresis in the I-V curves is consistent with transient\nmeasurements, in which the current is observed to decrease as a power-law in time\nI(t) =Iot\u2013\u03b1, in response to a voltage step [7]. For the same samples studied here we have\nmeasured 30 minute long current transients I(t) in response to voltage steps, as explained\nin Reference [7], and from power-law fits we obtain \u03b1 = (0.11\u00b1 0.04) independent of V.\nOne such current transient is shown in the inset of Fig. 4 (a). Although there is no\nsteady-state current, the small values of \u03b1 correspond to extremely slow decays of\ncurrent. We find no significant change of \u03b1 with annealing. As shown in Fig. 4 (a) the\ncurrent at 1s measured from the transient is in good agreement with that measured by\nsweeping V.\n(ii) The measured current is well described by an exponential form: we choose to\nfit to I \u2248 V/Ro e|V|/Vo, in order to extract a characteristic voltage Vo [V], and an equivalent\nresistance Ro [\u03a9] of the array. From these exponential fits to the data in Fig. 4 (a), we\nobtain Vo and Ro for voltage sweeps up, from |V| = 0 to 500 V. Before annealing\n\n8\n\n\f(curve I), we find Vo \u2248 31 V and Ro \u2248 7x1020 \u03a9. Ro corresponds to a huge sheet\nresistance of ~ 1023 \u03a9 per square.\n(iii) The measured current increases as the NC solid is annealed (curves II and\nIII). The current after annealing at 300 C (III) is approximately three orders of magnitude\nlarger than the original current (curve I) at fixed |V| \u2248 500 V. The I-V curves after\nannealing are also steeper, corresponding to a decrease in Vo. From exponential fits to\ncurves I to III, we find Vo decreases from \u2248 31 V to 23 V, and Ro decreases from \u2248\n7x1020 \u03a9 to 1x1020 \u03a9.\nThe photocurrent through NC solids is also enhanced by annealing. Figure 4 (b)\nshows the corresponding current-voltage curves under constant excitation from the LED,\nbefore annealing (labeled I) and after annealing at temperatures Ta = 110 C (II) and Ta =\n300 C (III). It appears that the photocurrent saturates at large electric fields\n(E > 108 V/m). This saturation of photocurrent has not been observed in previous\nmeasurements on as-deposited NC solids, presumably because lower fields have been\nused [8]. The origin of the saturation is being investigated in more detail [13]. At fields\nlarger than E \u2248 2x108V/m, the rise in the current appears to correspond to the onset of\ndark current (compare with Fig. 4 (a)). From Fig. 4 (b) we see that, like the dark current,\nthe photocurrent increases after annealing. In the voltage range where the dark current is\nnegligible (|V| < 200 V), the photocurrent increases by up to two orders of magnitude\nafter the NC solid is annealed at Ta = 300 C. Because the LED is not monochromatic and\nbecause the intensity of light impinging on the sample is not well controlled, more\ndetailed photocurrent measurements are being performed using laser excitation [13].\nThe I-V curves in Fig. 4 are presented as functions of voltage across the NC solid.\n\n9\n\n\fHowever, when I-V curves for NC solids with L = 1 \u03bcm and L = 2 \u03bcm are compared, we\nfind that both the dark and photocurrent scale with the electric field \u03b5 [7,8]. Specifically,\nthe dark current follows I \u221d e\u03b5 /\u03b5\u03bf, where \u03b5\u03bf=Vo/L, and \u03b5\u03bf is independent of gap size L.\nWe have confirmed this dependence for both the as-deposited and annealed samples.\nThe measurements described above have been performed on NC solids with\ndifferent parameters, including gap size L (see Fig 1. (a)), NC diameter D, annealing\ntemperature Ta and time. The results are summarized for TOPO-capped NCs in Table I.\nHere Vo is the exponent from the exponential fits to I-V curves for L = 2 \u03bcm. The other\nfit parameter Ro is, to a first approximation, inversely proportional to the film thickness.\nIt ranges from ~1022 \u03a9 to ~1025 \u03a9 per square for solids from ~1 \u03bcm to ~ 0.01 \u03bcm thick.\nThe effects of annealing on transport do not depend on whether voltages are applied to\nthe sample before annealing. We have also observed enhanced dark current and\nphotocurrent for samples that have been stored at room temperature in vacuum (p ~ 10-6\ntorr) for several days. Finally, the results presented above are for NCs solids deposited\non quartz substrates, but we have also used annealing to improve the conductivity of NC\nsolids deposited on degenerately doped Si substrates with a thermally grown gate oxide\n(SiO2).\n\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have demonstrated the enhancement of the dark current and photocurrent in\nNC solids and the red-shifts and broadening of the absorption spectra. The dark current\nis found to be approximately an exponential function of the applied electric field, whereas\n\n10\n\n\fthe photocurrent has a more complicated functional form, and saturates at higher fields.\nIn both cases, the functional forms of the I-V curves are approximately preserved after\nannealing, but the current increases by several orders of magnitude. In addition, TEM\ndata show that the inter-dot separation decreases upon annealing.\nThe red-shift in the absorption spectra have been previously observed in NC\nsystems as a function of the solvent composition [11], NC diameter and concentration\n[14,15]. These red-shifts have been attributed to the enhancement of either classical\n(dipole) coupling [11], or quantum-mechanical coupling between NCs [14,15]. To our\nknowledge, there are no previous observations of red-shifts caused by annealing.\nAs in Ref. [11], we find that the red-shifts observed in our work may be attributed\nto the change in polarization energy of the quantum-confined exciton when the dielectric\nenvironment around the NCs is changed. In the mean field approximation the average\ndielectric constant of the medium around each NC, \u03b5m, can be estimated as the volumeweighted average of dielectric constants for the organic spacer (\u03b5r = 2.1 [11]) and for the\nCdSe NC (\u03b5r = 6.2 [11]). When the inter-dot separation decreases, \u03b5m increases because\nthe volume fraction of CdSe increases. The average dielectric constant \u03b5m can also\nincrease because the dielectric constant of the organic material surrounding the NCs may\nincrease with annealing. Correspondingly, the excitonic peak shifts to lower energies.\nThis core-shell model of Ref. [11] can be applied in our case. From the TEM data we\nhave found that the inter-dot separation decreases from d = 1.1 nm to ~ 0.5 nm after\nannealing at ~ 350 C, which here corresponds to the first excitonic peak shifting by\n\u2206E ~ - 40 meV. Taking \u03b5r = 2.1 for TOPO and \u03b5r = 6.2 for CdSe NCs, the model of Eqs.\n[5] and [6] in Ref. [11] predicts that the change in NC spacing results in an energy shift\n\n11\n\n\fof \u2206E ~ - 10 meV, which is smaller than observed experimentally. Agreement is\nobtained only if one assumes that the dielectric constant of the organic cap increases\nslightly during annealing, from \u03b5r = 2.1 to \u03b5r ~ 3. Such a change in \u03b5r might arise from\nchemical changes in the organic. Thus, the magnitude of the observed red-shifts could be\nunderstood to result from the change of the external dielectric environment.\nWe find only a weak temperature dependence of the dark current in the\ntemperature range from T = 6 K to T = 250 K; in particular, the exponent Vo in\nexponential fits of the I-V curves is approximately temperature independent. This weak\ntemperature dependence suggests that electron tunneling is the main transport mechanism\nin CdSe NC solids for T < 250 K. References [6,7] provide evidence that the dark\ncurrent is limited by electron tunneling from a space-charge region near the electroninjecting electrode into unoccupied dots. Similar behavior has been observed in linear\nchains of carbon particles for voltages lower than the threshold predicted for collective\ntransport across the array [16]. To our knowledge, there is no theory to explain how the\nspace-charge builds up in systems with long-range Coulomb interactions. However, as\ndiscussed below, the transport measurements shown here suggest that Coulomb\ncorrelations play a major role in the transport through CdSe NC solids.\nThe increased current after annealing is most likely caused by a combination of\nthe decreased separation and the chemical transformation of the organic caps during\nannealing. When the width of the tunnel barrier is decreased by |\u2206d|, the tunneling\nprobability is expected to increase by ~ e\u03b1|\u2206d| (\u03b1\u22121 ~ 0.1 nm for alkane molecules [8]). For\nannealing at 350 C, we have found |\u2206d | ~ 0.6 nm, so that the tunneling probability is\nexpected to increase by a factor of ~ 400. This is consistent with results for the dark\n\n12\n\n\fcurrent, but smaller than observed for the photocurrent. Previous photocurrent\nmeasurements [8] have been made with a different organic cap tributylphosphine oxide\n(TBPO), whose length is d = (0.7\u00b10.1) nm [2], and whose barrier height is similar to that\nof TOPO. These measurements have shown a slightly smaller effect of decreasing interdot separation on transport properties than expected from a simple tunneling model when\nthe barrier width is decreased. It is therefore likely that the changes in transport\nproperties with annealing are caused both by the decreased separation and by the\nchemical transformation of the organic caps during annealing in a reducing atmosphere.\nTOPO decomposes into a carbonaceous substance during annealing and this process\ncould lower the tunnel barriers between NCs.\nAlthough the increase in dark current through the NC solids after annealing could\nresult from the enhancement of inter-dot tunneling, a simple tunneling model cannot\nexplain our dark current-voltage curves quantitatively. For the dark current\nmeasurements in Fig. 4 (a), we find an approximately temperature-independent\nexponential form I \u221d e|V|/Vo of the current-voltage curves. Qualitatively, this form is\nexpected for electron tunneling, and results from the lowering of inter-dot potential\nbarriers when the electric field is applied across the NC solid. However, this simple\nmodel predicts a value for the coefficient Vo which is inconsistent with the data. This can\nbe shown by estimating the probability for electron tunneling |T|2 from one NC to its\nnearest neighbor. In the semiclassical approximation,\nd\n\n| T | ~ exp[ \u22122 \u222b dx (2 m * h 2 )( Eb \u2212 Eo \u2212 e\u03b5x )] , where m* \u2248 0.1 me [12] is the effective\n2\n\n0\n\nelectron mass in CdSe, \u03b5 \u2248 V/ (\u03b5m L) is the electric field inside the NC solid, d is the\n\n13\n\n\fwidth of the barrier, Eb is the height of the barrier, and Eo is the ground state energy\ninside a NC. For small applied voltages per NC compared to the barrier height (e\u03b5d <<\nEb-Eo), this expression reduces to |T|2 ~ exp (\u03b2V), consistent with the form observed\nexperimentally. However, \u03b2 = (2 m * h 2 )( Eb \u2212 Eo )\u22121 ed 2 /(2\u03b5 m L) , and for d = 1.1 nm,\nL = 2 \u03bcm, \u03b5m = 3.7 (for D = 5nm) [17], and assuming Eb-Eo ~ 1 eV [8], we find that Vo ~\n7 x 103 V, whereas the measured value is ~ 30 V.\nOn the other hand, the characteristic voltage Vo obtained from the exponential fits\nis comparable to the Coulomb interaction energies in the NC array. In the measurements\non different sample lengths, we have found that the current depends on the electric field\nacross the device. Therefore, for N dots across the gap, N \u2248 L/(D+d), the exponential\nform of the dark current can be rewritten as I \u221d e\n\nv /v\u03bf\n\n, where v is the applied voltage\n\ndifference across one NC in the array and v\u03bf = Vo/N. We find that v\u03bf is comparable to the\nCoulomb interaction energy Eint between charges on nearest-neighbor NCs. Specifically,\nfrom the data in Table I, we find v\u03bf ~ 50 to 300 meV. On the other hand, for charges on\nnearest-neighbor NCs embedded in a medium of average dielectric constant \u03b5m, the\nCoulomb interaction is Eint = e2/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u03bf\u03b5m(D+d)). For D = 5 nm, d = 1.1 nm, and \u03b5m \u2248 3.7\n[17], we find Eint ~ 60 meV, similar to v\u03bf.\nThe changes of v\u03bf (=Vo/N) after annealing are comparable to the red-shifts \u2206E of\nthe band-edge peak. For example, in Fig. 3 (a) for D = 4.9 nm, we find \u2206E ~ -30 meV\nafter annealing at 300 C, whereas the corresponding change in v\u03bf, found from the data of\nFig. 4 (a), is \u2206 v\u03bf ~ - 20 mV. It seems reasonable to expect that these two quantities\nshould be comparable if both of them reflect the Coulomb interaction between electron\n\n14\n\n\fcharges at a distance comparable to the NC diameter D. Specifically, we have proposed\nthat the red-shifts reflect the Coulomb interaction energy of the electron-hole pair,\nwhereas v\u03bf reflects the Coulomb interaction energy between electrons on nearestneighbor NCs.\nWhile conductance through arrays of metallic NCs has been studied theoretically,\nwe know of no theoretical treatment of tunneling limited by long-range Coulomb\ninteractions that might explain the exponential voltage dependence. In the absence of\ntheoretical models, we find that the close agreement between v\u03bf and the Coulomb\ninteraction energy Eint between electrons on nearest-neighbor NCs strongly suggests the\nimportance of Coulomb interactions in the tunneling current.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that annealing of NC solids reduces the\ndistance between NCs, and alters their optical and transport properties. Controlled\nannealing might serve as a useful tool to tune the properties of NC arrays and facilitate\nthe observation of new collective phenomena.\nThis work has been supported by the MRSEC program of the National Science\nFoundation under award No. DMR 9808941.
