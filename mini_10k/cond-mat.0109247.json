INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent experimental success [1\u20135] in Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at ultralow temperature in dilute trapped alkali metal and hydrogen atoms has intensified theoretical studies\nof the inhomogeneous, weakly interacting dilute Bose gas and its condensation [6\u201317]. At\nzero temperature such a system is supposed to be fully condensed and described by the\nmean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation [12,18,19].\nTwo most interesting phenomena in BEC are the collapse for attractive interaction and\nthe formation of coupled atomic condensate. For attractive atomic interaction [4\u20137], the\ncondensate is stable for a maximum critical number of atoms. In the presence of an external\nsource of atoms when the number increases beyond the critical number, due to interatomic\nattraction the radius of BEC tends to zero and the central density tends to infinity. Consequently, the condensate collapses emitting atoms until the number of atoms is reduced\nbelow the critical number and a stable configuration is reached. Then the condensate can\ngrow again and a series of collapses can take place, which was observed experimentally in\nthe BEC of 7 Li with attractive interaction [4\u20137].\nThere has also been experimental realization of BEC involving atoms in two different\nquantum states [20\u201322]. In one experiment\n\n87\n\nRb atoms formed in the |F = 1, m = \u22121i and\n\n|F = 2, m = 1i states by the use of a laser served as two different species, where F and m\nare the total angular momentum and its projection [20,21]. In another experiment a coupled\nBEC was formed with the\n\n87\n\nRb atoms in the |F = 1, m = \u22121i and |F = 2, m = 2i states\n\n[12,22]. It is possible to use the same magnetic trap to confine atoms in two quantum states\nand this makes these experiments technically simpler compared to a realization of BEC with\ntwo different types of atoms requiring two independent trapping mechanisms.\nHere we study theoretically the dynamics of a coupled BEC composed of two quantum\nstates 1 and 2 of an atom using the coupled time-dependent GP equation. We include an\ninteraction term in the Hamiltonian that allows for a coherent boson-number-conserving\nnondissipative transition of atoms from one quantum state to another. This interaction\n2\n\n\fsimulates the action of a laser which can been used experimentally to transform one species\nof atoms to another. This model exhibits rich and novel phenomenology which we study\nusing the numerical solution of the coupled GP equation, which can generate oscillation in\nthe number of atoms in a specific state in the presence of the interaction that transforms\none spices of atoms to another. Also, depending on the nature of the atomic interactions\none can have three possibilities of BEC: (i) stable condensate of both components for all\nrepulsive interactions, (ii) collapse of both components for all attractive interactions, and\n(iii) a stable condensate for one component and collapse in the other.\nThe collapse for attractive interaction(s) in a coupled condensate is studied by introducing absorptive contact interactions responsible for a growth in the atomic numbers from\nexternal source in addition to imaginary three-body quartic interactions leading to recombination loss [6,7]. In the presence of these imaginary interactions the GP equation does\nnot conserve the overall number of atoms. If the strengths (and signs) of these imaginary\ninteractions are properly chosen, one can have collapse in one or both components of the\ncondensate. The solution of the GP equation could produce a growth of the condensate\nwith time for atom numbers less than the critical numbers for collapse. Once they increase\npast the critical numbers, the three-body interaction takes control and the numbers suddenly drop below the critical level by recombination loss signaling a collapse [6,7]. Then\nthe absorptive term takes over and the individual numbers start to increase. This continues\nindefinitely showing an infinite sequence of collapses for one or both components.\nWe motivate this study by considering two possible atomic states 1 and 2 of 7 Li (attractive\ninteraction) and of\n\n87\n\nRb (repulsive interaction) whenever possible. In the case of 7 Li the\n\ninteraction in state 1 is taken to be attractive which is responsible for collapse. We study\nthe collapse with different possibilities of attraction and repulsion between atoms in states\n1 and 2 of 7 Li.\n\n3\n\n\fII. COUPLED GROSS-PITAEVSKII EQUATION\n\nWe consider the following Hamiltonian to describe the coupled BEC allowing for the\npossibility of transforming atoms from one state to another [12]\n\u0124 = \u01240 + V\u03021 + V\u03022 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the kinetic and potential energies are\n\u01240 =\n\nZ\n\nd~r\n\n2\nX\n\n\u03c8\u0302j\u2020 (~r)\n\nj=1\n\nV\u03021 =\n\nX\nl,j\n\nV\u03022 = \u03c7\n\nZ\n\nh\u03042 2\n(j)\n\u2212\n\u2207j + Vtr (~r) \u03c8\u0302j (~r),\n2m\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(2)\n\nglj Z\nd~r\u03c8\u0302l\u2020 (~r)\u03c8\u0302j\u2020 (~r)\u03c8\u0302l (~r)\u03c8\u0302j (~r),\n2\n\n(3)\n\nd~r[\u03c8\u03021\u2020 (~r)\u03c8\u03022 (~r) + \u03c8\u03022\u2020 (~r)\u03c8\u03021 (~r)],\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c8\u0302j (~r) and \u03c8\u0302j\u2020 (~r) are the field operators for annihilation and creation of the bosonic\n(j)\n\natom of mass m in state j = 1, 2, Vtr (~r) is external trapping potential, V\u03021 is the usual\nnonlinear potential between the atoms interacting via a contact interaction of strength glj =\n4\u03c0h\u03042 alj /m between two atoms in states l and j, alj is the scattering length of atoms in states\nl and j, and V\u03022 is the potential which allows for the laser-induced transition of an atom from\nstate 1 to 2 and vice versa via a contact interaction of strength \u03c7.\nCoupled mean-field GP equations are obtained by replacing the field operators \u03c8\u0302j (~r) by\nthe wave functions \u03c8j (~r), which are the expectation values of the field operators, in the\nHeisenberg equation [12]:\nih\u0304\n\nh\ni\n\u2202\n\u03c8\u0302j (~r, \u03c4 ) = \u03c8\u0302j (~r, \u03c4 ), \u0124 ,\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the time (\u03c4 ) dependence is explicitly shown and the result is [23\u201325]\n\u0014\n\n\u2212\n\n2\nX\nh\u03042 1 \u2202 2\n1\n2 2\nr\n+\nc\nm\u03c9\nr\n+\ngjl nl |\u03c8l (r, \u03c4 )|2\nj\n2m r \u2202r 2\n2\nl=1\n\n2\nX\n\u2202\n\u03c8j (r, \u03c4 ) +\n\u03c7(1 \u2212 \u03b4jl )\u03c8l (r, \u03c4 ) = 0,\n\u2212 ih\u0304\n\u2202\u03c4\nl=1\n\n\u0015\n\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere \u03b4jl is the Kronecker delta and nl is the number of condensed atoms in state l. Here\nwe have specialized to the radially symmetric case and have used the harmonic oscillator\n(j)\n\ntrapping potential Vtr (~r) = cj m\u03c9 2 r 2 /2 where \u03c9 is the trap frequency and cj is a parameter\nintroduced to vary independently the trap potential in each quantum state.

In Eqs. (8) we have introduced a diagonal\nabsorptive i\u03b3j and a quartic three-body term \u2212i\u03bej |\u03c6j (x, t)|4 /x4 appropriate to study collapse\n[6,7]. A nonzero \u03b3j allows the possibility of the absorption of atoms from an external source\ninto the condensate, whereas a nonzero \u03bej allows for the possibility of ejection of atoms\nfrom the condensate due to three-body recombination. The total number of atoms in the\ncondensate is not conserved for nonzero \u03b3j and \u03bej .\nThe fluctuation of the number of atoms in the two states of the condensate is best studied\nvia the quantities\nNj \u2261\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n|\u03c6j (x, t)|2 dx,\n\nj = 1, 2.\n\n(9)\n\nIn the presence of a general absorptive interaction \u03b7 6= 0, \u03b3j 6= 0, and \u03bej 6= 0, the reduced\nnumber for the two components of the condensate are given by n11 N1 and n22 N2 , the quantities N1 and N2 carry the information about time evolution of the number of the two\ncomponents. The actual number of atoms in the two components are nj Nj , j = 1, 2.\n5\n\n\fFor \u03b3j = \u03bej = \u03b7 = 0, the number of atoms in the two components are conserved\nseparately. This condition leads to Nj = 1. For \u03b3j = \u03bej = 0 and \u03b7 6= 0, the numbers of\natoms in the two components are not conserved separately Nj 6= 1; but the total number\nis conserved. In the presence of absorptive interaction \u03b3j 6= 0 and/or \u03bej 6= 0, there is no\nconservation of even the total number of atoms.\n\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA. Computational Procedure\n\nTo solve Eqs. (8) numerically the proper boundary conditions as x \u2192 0 and \u221e are\nneeded. For a confined condensate the asymptotic form of the physically acceptable solution\nis given by limx\u2192\u221e |\u03c6j (x, t)| \u223c exp(\u2212x2 /4). At x = 0 one has the regularity condition\n\u03c6j (0, t) = 0.\nNext we discretize Eqs. (8) in both space and time by using a space step h and time step\n\u2206 with a finite difference scheme using the unknown (\u03c6j )kp which are approximation to the\nexact solution \u03c6j (xp , tk ) where xp = ph and tk = k\u2206. After discretization we obtain a set\nof algebraic equations which could then be solved by using the known asymptotic boundary\nconditions [6,7,11]. The time derivative in these equations involves the wave functions at\ntimes tk and tk+1 . To discretize Eqs. (8) we express the wave functions and their derivatives\nin terms of the average over times tk and tk+1 [26] and the result is the following CrankNicholson-type scheme [26]\n\u0014\n(\u03c6j )k+1\n\u2212 (\u03c6j )kp\n1\np\nk+1\ni\n= \u2212 2 (\u03c6j )k+1\np+1 \u2212 2(\u03c6j )p\n\u2206\n2h\n\u0015\n\nk\nk\nk\n+ (\u03c6j )k+1\np\u22121 + (\u03c6j )p+1 \u2212 2(\u03c6j )p + (\u03c6j )p\u22121\n\n2\n|(\u03c6j )kp |4\n|(\u03c6l )kp |2\n1 cj x2p X\n\u2212 i\u03bej\n+ i\u03b3j\n+\nnjl\n+\n2 4\nx2p\nx4p\nl=1\n\n\"\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\u00d7 (\u03c6j )k+1\n+ (\u03c6j )kp +\np\n\n2\nX\nl=1\n\nwhere j = 1, 2.\n6\n\n\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b4lj )(\u03c6l )kp ,\n\n#\n\n(10)\n\n\fConsidering that the wave function components \u03c6j are known at time tk , Eqs. (10)\nk+1\ninvolve the unknowns \u2212 (\u03c6j )k+1\nand (\u03c6j )k+1\np+1 , (\u03c6j )p\np\u22121 at time tk+1 . In a lattice of N points\n\nEqs. (10) represent a tridiagonal set for p = 2, 3, ..., (N \u22121) for a specific component \u03c6j . This\nset has a unique solution if the wave functions at the two end points (\u03c6j )k+1\nand (\u03c6j )k+1\nare\n1\nN\nknown [26]. These values at the end points are provided by the known asymptotic boundary\nconditions.\nTo solve Eqs. (10) we employ space step h = 0.0001 with xmax \u2264 15 and time step \u2206\n=0.05. After some experimentation we find that these values of the steps give good convergence. The iteration is started with the known normalized (harmonic oscillator) solution of\nEqs. (8) obtained with njl = \u03b3j = \u03bej = \u03b7 = 0. The nonlinear parameters njl are increased\nby equal amounts over 1000 time iterations starting from zero at t = \u221250 until the desired\nfinal value is reached at t = 0. During the iteration we keep \u03bej = \u03b3j = 0 and attribute a\nsmall numerical value to \u03b7 (< 0.2). The resulting solution is the ground state of the condensate corresponding to the specific nonlinearity and built up with this particular value of\n\u03b7. Then to study the dynamics we allow the system to evolve by continuing the iteration\nwith \u2206 = 0.05 and h = 0.0001 for positive t, but maintaining \u03b7 and nij at the constant\nfinal values attained at t = 0. To study the dynamics for positive t for attractive atomic\ninteraction, the absorptive contact (\u03b3j ) and the three-body interactions (\u03bej ) are switched on\nat t = 0. This will clearly show the possible collapse of the system.\n\nB. Stable Condensate: Repulsive Interaction\n\nFirst we consider the stationary solution of Eqs. (8) with \u03b3j = \u03bej = 0 in the repulsive\ncase. We now choose the following two sets of of parameters before the actual calculation:\nn11 = n22 = 10, n12 = n21 = 5, c1 = 1, c2 = 0.25, (a)\u03b7 = 0.075 and (b) \u03b7 = 0.1. This will\nshow the effect of the feedback between the two atomic states. In this case all interactions\n\u221a\nare repulsive corresponding to positive sign of all njl \u2261 2 2nj ajl /aho .\nAlthough the parameters above are in dimensionless units, it is easy to associate them\n7\n\n\fwith a physical problem of experimental interest in the case \u03b7 = 0. For example, for the\nmixture of |F = 1, m = \u22121i and |F = 2, m = 1i states of\n\n87\n\nRb, the ratio of scattering\n\nlengths a|1,\u22121i /a|2,1i = 1.062 [21]. If we label state |1, \u22121i by 1 and |2, 1i by 2, and consider\na11 /aho \u2243 a22 /aho \u2243 0.002, then n11 = n22 = 10 corresponds to n1 \u2243 n2 \u2243 1770 for \u03b7 = 0.\nHence these models can simulate the actual experimental situation composed of two states\nof\n\n87\n\nRb.\n\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the wave functions |\u03c6j (x, 0)|/x for the two components calculated\nwith two nonzero values of \u03b7 above. In Figs. 2 (a) and (b) we plot the quantities N1\nand N2 for these models. When \u03b7 = 0, N1 = N2 = 1. As a nonzero value of \u03b7 is taken,\nthe quantities Nj oscillate with time as can be seen from Figs. 2 (a) and (b). When N1\nincreases, N2 decreases and this denotes a net transformation of atoms from state 2 to 1 and\nvice versa. These transformations lead to interesting oscillation in Nj and consequently, in\nthe actual number of atoms in the two states. For a small \u03b7 these oscillations are small and\nas \u03b7 increases these oscillations increase in amplitude. These oscillations clearly show the\ncontinued dynamical conversion of one species of atoms to another in the otherwise stable\ncondensate.\n\nC. Collapse: Attractive Interaction\n\nNow we study the simplest case of collapse by taking only the interaction between the\natoms in state 1 to be attractive corresponding to a negative a11 . All other scattering\nlengths \u2212 a22 and a12 (= a21 ) \u2212 are taken to be positive. Quite expectedly, here the first\ncomponent of the condensate could experience collapse. We also consider the collapse in\nboth components when all scattering lengths are negative.\nThe calculation is performed in these cases with the following two sets of parameters (a)\nn11 = \u22123.0346, n22 = 4, n12 = n21 = 1, c1 = 0.25, c2 = 4, \u03b7 = 0.2 and (b) n11 = \u22120.67, n22 =\n\u22121.4, n12 = \u22120.42, n21 = \u22120.41, c1 = 4, c2 = 0.25, \u03b7 = 0.1. The wave function components\nat t = 0 in these cases are plotted in Fig. 3.\n8\n\n\fThe above parameters are in dimensionless units and one can associate them with a\nproblem of experimental interest for \u03b7 = 0 in terms of two states of 7 Li. In case of model\n(a) above we consider the state 1 to be the ground state of 7 Li with attractive interaction as\n\u221a\nin the actual collapse experiment with |a11 |/aho \u2243 0.0005 [4,5]. As n11 = 2 2n1 |a11 |/aho ,\nthis corresponds to a boson number n1 \u2243 2145. This number is larger than the maximum\nnumber of atoms permitted in the BEC of a single component 7 Li which is about 1400 [4,5].\nThe state 2 could be one of the excited states of 7 Li with repulsive atomic interaction. The\npresence of the second component with repulsive interaction allows for the formation of a\nstable BEC with more 7 Li atoms in quantum state 1 than allowed in the single-component\nBEC. We find from Fig. 3 that \u03c61 (full line) is very much centrally peaked compared to\n\u03c62 (dashed line) in this case. This corresponds to a small radius and large central density\nfor the first component denoting an approximation to collapse. If the number n1 is slightly\nincreased beyond 2200 the first component of the condensate wave function becomes singular\nat the origin and could experience collapse.\nIn case of model (b) we take the atomic interaction in both states of 7 Li to be attractive corresponding to negative scattering lengths. For |aii |/aho \u2243 0.0005 as in the actual\nexperiment [4,5], one has n1 = 470 and n2 \u2243 990 for \u03b7 = 0. The total number of particles\nin this case is roughly 1460, which is close to the critical number 1400 found in the actual\nexperiment of collapse in 7 Li. Both wave-function components could become singular in this\ncase as all possible interactions are attractive. The small extension of the wave-function\ncomponents in space in this case as in Fig. 3 denote an approximation to collapse.\nAlthough the collapse of the coupled condensates could be inferred from the shape of\nthe stationary wave functions of Fig. 3 (sharply peaked centrally with small radii), we also\nstudy the dynamics of collapse from a time evolution of the full GP equation (8) in the\npresence of an absorption and three-body recombination, e.g., for \u03b3j 6= 0 and \u03bej 6= 0 as in\nthe uncoupled case [6]. The general nature of time evolution is independent of the actual\nvalues of \u03b3j and \u03bej employed provided that a small value for \u03bej and a relatively larger one\nfor \u03b3j are chosen [6].\n9\n\n\fFirst we consider model (a). For a dynamic description of this problem we take for t > 0\n\u03b31 = \u03b32 = 0.04, \u03be1 = 0.01 and \u03be2 = 0.002 and allow the solution of the GP equation to\nevolve in time using Eq. (10). In the presence of these absorptive interactions the total\nnumber of atoms is not a constant of motion. The time evolution of N1 and N2 is shown\nin Fig. 4 (a). There is small oscillation in Nj for t < 0 signifying a transfer of one type of\natoms to the other. For t > 0 these oscillations are almost undetectable. Because of the\nattractive interaction, the component 1 could experience a succession of collapse. This is\nmanifested in the successive growth and decay of N1 . The condensate corresponding to the\nsecond component controlled by the repulsive interaction keeps on growing, manifested by\nthe continuous growth of N2 with time.\nNext we consider the time evolution of the GP equation for model (b) with the following\nabsorptive parameters: \u03b31 = 0.04, \u03b32 = 0.03, \u03be1 = \u03be2 = 0.005. In this case as all interactions\nare attractive, both components can experience collapse. In Fig 4 (b) we plot the evolution of\nN1 and N2 . The oscillation of N1 and N2 is clearly visible for t < 0. For t > 0, the absorptive\ninteractions take control and the total number of atoms start to increase. Consequently, the\ndynamics of collapse is more visible than the oscillation in N1 and N2 . Both N1 and N2 is\nfound to exhibit a succession of growth and decay corresponding to collapse. Hence we find\nthat one can have a dynamical collapse of one or both components of the BEC in the case\nof a coupled condensate.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, we studied the collapse in a trapped BEC of atoms in states 1 and 2\nusing the GP equation when some of the atomic interactions are attractive. We include\nan interaction in the Hamiltonian which allow for a spontaneous transformation of atoms\nfrom state 1 to 2 and vice versa. Experimentally, this can be achieved by a laser and makes\nthe present study richer. In case of all repulsive atomic interactions one can have a stable\ncondensate of both components. When some of the atomic interactions are attractive one\n10\n\n\for both components of the condensate could experience collapse. The collapse could be\npredicted from a stationary solution of the GP equation. The time evolution of collapse is\nstudied via the time-dependent GP equation with absorption and three-body recombination.\nThe number of particles of the component(s) of BEC experiencing collapse alternately grows\nand decays with time. With the possibility of a detailed study of a coupled BEC, the results\nof this study could be verified experimentally in the future.\nThe work is supported in part by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico\ne Tecnol\u00f3gico and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo of Brazil.\n\n11\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] J.
