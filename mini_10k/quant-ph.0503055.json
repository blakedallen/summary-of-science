In particular, a great deal of\nattention has been devoted to cavity-assisted nonlinear\ntransverse effects, such as pattern formation [4] and spatial soliton generation [5]. More recently the quantum\naspects of these phenomena have begun to be studied,\nmainly at the theoretical level, under the general name\nof \"quantum imaging\", especially in planar or confocal\ncavities.\nAlmost all the investigations relative to intra-cavity\nnonlinear effects, both at the classical and quantum level,\nhave been performed within the mean field approximation, in which one considers that the different interacting\nfields undergo only weak changes through their propagation inside the cavity, in terms of their longitudinal and\ntransverse parameters. This almost universal approach\nsimplifies a great deal the theoretical investigations, and\nnumerical simulations are generally needed if one wants\nto go beyond this approximation [9]. It implies in particular that diffraction is assumed to be negligible inside\nthe nonlinear medium, which limits the applicability of\nthe method to nonlinear media whose length lc is much\nsmaller than the Rayleigh length zR of the cavity modes\nzc (so called \"thin\" medium). This is a configuration\nthat experimentalists do not like much: they prefer to\noperate in the case lc \u2243 zc which yields a much more efficient non linear interaction for a given pump power [10].\n\nIf one wants to predict results of experiments in realistic\nsituations, one therefore needs to extend the theory beyond the usual thin nonlinear medium approximation,\nand take into account diffraction effects occurring together with the nonlinear interaction inside the medium.\nThe effects of simultaneous diffraction and nonlinear\npropagation have already been taken into account in\nthe case of free propagation, i.e. without optical cavity\naround the nonlinear crystal, and they have been found\nto have a direct influence on the shape of the propagating\nbeam [3]. These effects have also been studied in detail\nat the quantum level in the parametric amplifier case [8],\nand recently for the soliton case [11]. In contrast, they do\nnot play a significant role when the nonlinear medium is\ninserted in an optical cavity with non degenerate transverse modes, which imposes the shape of the mode. But\nthey are of paramount importance in the case of cavities having degenerate transverse modes, such as a plane\nor confocal cavity, which do not impose the transverse\nstructure of the interacting fields, and which are used to\ngenerate multimode quantum effects.\nWithin the thin crystal approximation, i.e. taking into\naccount diffraction effects only outside the crystal, striking quantum properties have been predicted to occur in\na degenerate OPO below threshold using a confocal cavity [12, 13]: this device generates quadrature squeezed\nlight which is multimode in the transverse domain. It\nwas shown in the case of a plane pump that the level of\nsqueezing measured at the output of such an OPO neither depends on the spatial profile of the local oscillator\nused to probe it, nor on the size of the detection region.\nThis implies that a significant quantum noise reduction,\n\n\f2\nin principle tending to perfection when one approaches\nthe oscillation threshold from below, can be observed in\narbitrarily small portions of the down-converted beam.\nTherefore in this model there is no limitation in the transverse size of the domains in which the quantum noise\nis reduced when the OPO works in the exact confocal\nconfiguration. Such a multimode squeezed light appears\nthereby as a very promising tool to increase the resolution in optical images beyond the wavelength limit.\nIt is therefore very important to make a more realistic\ntheoretical model of this system, which is no longer limited by the thin crystal approximation, to see whether\nthe predicted local squeezing is still present in actual experimental realizations in which the crystal length is of\nthe order of the Rayleigh range of the resonator. This is\nthe purpose of the present paper, in which we will show\nthat the presence of a long crystal inside the resonator\nimposes a lower limit to the size of the regions in which\nsqueezing can be measured (\"coherence area\"), which is\nproportional to wc2 lc /zR , where wc is the cavity beam\nwaist, lc is the crystal length and zR the Rayleigh range\nof the resonator.\nThe following section (section II) is devoted to the general description of the model that is used to treat the\neffect of diffraction inside the crystal, using the assumption that the single pass nonlinear interaction is weak in\nthe crystal. We then describe in section III the method\nthat is used to determine the squeezing spectra measured\nin well-defined homodyne detection schemes. We give in\nsections IV and V the results for such quantities respectively in the near field and in the far field, and conclude\nin section VI.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nAssumptions of the model\n\nLet us consider a confocal cavity, that for simplicity we\ntake as a ring cavity of the kind shown schematically in\nFig. 1 ([14][15]). It is formed by four plane mirrors and\n\ny x\nz\n\nz=0\npump 2\u03c9S\n\nMc\n\nf\n\nf\n\nsignal \u03c9S\n\nC\n\nf\n\nf\nf\n\nC'\n\nf\n\nFIG. 1: Confocal ring cavity. The mirrors transmit the pump\nwave and reflect the signal wave, with the exception of mirror\nMc that partially transmits the signal.\n\ntwo lenses having a focal length equal to one quarter of\nthe total cavity length, and symmetrically placed along\nthe cavity, so that the focal points coincides at two positions C and C'. It contains a type I parametric medium\nof length lc , centered on the point C (see figure). It is\npumped by a field Ap of frequency 2\u03c9s having a Gaussian\nshape and focused in the plane containing the point C.\nIn such a plane the variation of the mean envelope with\nthe transverse coordinate x is given by :\nAp (x) = Ap exp(\u2212\n\n|x|2\n)\nwp2\n\n(1)\n\nWe assume that the mirrors are totally transparent for\nthe pump wave, and perfectly reflecting for the field at\nfrequency \u03c9s , except for the coupling mirror Mc , which\nhas a small transmission t at this frequency. The system\nwas described in [13] under the thin parametric medium\napproximation. We will follow here the same approach,\ngeneralized to the case of a thick parametric medium of\nlength lc . The intracavity signal field at frequency \u03c9s\nis described by a field envelope operator B\u0302(x, z), where\nz is the longitudinal coordinate along the cavity (z = 0\ncorresponding to plane C), obeying the standard equal\ntime commutation relation at a given transverse plane at\nposition z:\n[B\u0302(x, z, t), B\u0302 \u2020 (x', z, t)] = \u03b4(x \u2212 x').\n\n(2)\n\nAs we are only interested in the regime below threshold\nand without pump depletion, the pump field fluctuations\ndo not play any role.\nIn a confocal resonator the cavity resonances corresponds to complete sets of Gauss-Laguerre modes with\na given parity for transverse coordinate inversion; we assume that a set of cavity even modes is tuned to resonance with the signal field, and that the odd modes are\nfar off-resonance. It is then useful to introduce the even\npart of the field operator:\nB\u0302+ (x, z, t) =\n\n1\n{B\u0302(x, z, t) + B\u0302(\u2212x, z, t)] ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhich obeys a modified commutation relation:\n\u2020\n[B\u0302+ (x, z, t), B\u0302+\n(x', z, t)] =\n\n1\n[\u03b4(x \u2212 x') + \u03b4(x + x')] (4)\n2\n\nand can be written as an expansion over the even GaussLaguerre modes:\nX\nB\u0302+ (x, z, t) =\nfp,l (x, z)\u00e2p,l (z, t) ,\n(5)\np,leven\n\nwhere \u00e2p,l (z, t) is the annihilation operator of a photon\nin mode (p, l) at the cavity position z and at time t.\nThe interaction Hamiltonian of the system in the interaction picture is given by\nZ\nZ Z\ni~g lc /2 \u2032\n\u02c6\u2020\ndz\nd2 x\u2032 {AP (x', z \u2032 )[B+\n(x', z \u2032 , t)]2 \u2212h.c.} ,\nHint =\n2lc \u2212lc /2\n(6)\n\n\f3\nwhere g is the coupling constant proportional to the second order nonlinear susceptibility \u03c7(2) . This equation\ngeneralizes the thin medium parametric Hamiltonian of\nRef.[16].\nB.\n\nEvolution equation in the image plane\n(near-field)\n\nIn previous approaches [12, 13], the crystal was assumed to be thin, so that one could neglect the longitudinal dependence of AP and B\u0302+ along the crystal\nlength in the Hamiltonian (6). This cannot be done in\na thick crystal. We will nevertheless make a simplifying assumption which turns out to be very realistic in\nthe c.w. regime, with pump powers below 1W. We assume that the nonlinear interaction is very weak, so that\nit does not affect much the field amplitudes in a single\npass through the crystal. We will therefore remove the\nz dependence of the operators \u00e2p,l in Eqs.(5, 6), assuming \u00e2p,l (z, t) = \u00e2p,l (z = 0, t) = \u00e2p,l (t), where z = 0 is the\ncrystal/cavity center C. The longitudinal variation of the\nsignal operator B\u0302 is then only due to diffraction and is\ndescribed by the well-known z dependence of the modal\nfunctions fp,l (x, z). This assumption leads to a rather\nsimple expression of the commutator for the B\u0302+ field at\ndifferent positions inside the crystal:\n\u2020\n[B\u0302+ (x, z, t), B\u0302+\n(x', z \u2032 , t\u2032 )] = G\u2217+ (z \u2212 z \u2032 ; x, x') .\n\n(7)\n\nHere G+ (z; x, x') is the symmetrized part of the Fresnel\npropagator G(z; x, x'), describing the field linear propagation inside the crystal:\n1\nG+ (z; x, x') = [G(z; x, x') + G(z; x, \u2212x')] .\n2\n\n(8)\n\niks iks |x\u2212x\u2032 \u2212\u03c1s z|2\n2z\n,\ne\n2\u03c0z\n\n\u2202 B\u0302+\n\u2020\n(x, 0, t)|int = gAP (x)B\u0302+\n(x, 0, t)\n\u2202t\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ks = ns \u03c9s /c is the field wavenumber, with ns being\nthe index of refraction at frequency \u03c9s , and we have introduced a walk-off term, present only if the signal wave is\nan extraordinary one, described by the two-dimensional\nwalk-off angle \u03c1s .\nIt is now possible to derive the time evolution of the\nfield operator B\u0302(x, z, t) due to the parametric interaction.\nWe will for example calculate it at the mid-point plane\nz = 0 of the crystal :\nZ Z\n\u2202 B\u0302+\n\u2020\n=g\nd2 x\"Kint (x, x\")B\u0302+\n(x\", 0, t)\n(x, 0, t)\n\u2202t\nint\n(10)\nwith the integral kernel Kint given by :\nZ\nZ Z\n1 lc /2 \u2032\nKint (x, x\") =\ndz\nd2 x\u2032\n(11)\nlc \u2212lc /2\nAP (x', z \u2032 )G\u2217+ (z \u2032 ; x', x)G\u2217+ (z \u2032 ; x', x\") .\n\n(12)\n\nIn the thin crystal case (Eq.(12)), the parametric interaction is local, i.e. the operators at different positions\nof the transverse plane are not coupled to each other,\nwhereas in the thick crystal case (Eq.(11)), the parametric interaction mixes the operators at different points of\nthe transverse plane, over areas of finite extension. Note\nhowever that operators corresponding to different z values are not coupled to each other, because of our assumption of weak parametric interaction. This situation\nis very close to the one considered in refs.[6, 7, 8] for parametric down-conversion and amplification in a single-pass\ncrystal, where finite transverse coherence areas for the\nspatial quantum effects arise because of the finite spatial\nemission bandwidth of the crystal. In a similar way, in\nour case the spatial extension of the kernel Kint will turn\nout to give the minimum size in which spatial correlation\nor local squeezing can be observed in such a system. The\nanalogy will become more evident in the next section,\nwhere we will explicitly solve the propagation equation\nof the Fourier spatial modes along the crystal.\nIn order to get the complete evolution equation for the\nsignal beam, one must add the free Hamiltonian evolution\nof the intracavity beam and the damping effects. This\npart of the treatment is standard [17], and is identical\nto the case of a thin crystal inserted in a confocal cavity\n[13]. The final evolution equation reads:\n\u2202 B\u0302+\n(x, 0, t) = \u2212\u03b3(1 + i\u2206)B\u0302+ (x, 0, t)\n\u2202tZ Z\n\n+g\n\nwith\nG(z; x, x') =\n\nIn the limit of a thin crystal considered in Refs.[12, 13],\nEq.

It is described by the\nFresnel propagator Gp (z; x, x'), equal to (9) when one\nreplaces ks by the pump wavenumber kp , and the signal\nwalk-off angle \u03c1s with the pump walk-off angle \u03c1p .

Fourier modes can be observed in the far-field plane\nwith respect to the crystal center C, which in turn can\nbe detected in the focal plane of a lens placed outside the\ncavity. Let us introduce the spatial Fourier transform of\nthe signal field envelope operator\nZ 2\nd x\nB\u0302+ (x, z, t)e\u2212iq*x\nB\u0302+ (q, z, t) =\n2\u03c0\ni\n1h\nB\u0302(q, z, t) + B\u0302(\u2212q, z, t)\n(20)\n=\n2\nEquation (14) becomes:\n\u2202 B\u0302+\n(q, 0, t) = \u2212\u03b3(1 + i\u2206)B\u0302+ (q, 0, t) +\n(21)\n\u2202t\nZ\np\n\u2020\ng d2 q\"K\u0303int (q, q\")B\u0302+\n(q\", 0, t) + 2\u03b3 B\u0303+ in (q, 0, t) ,\nwhere the coupling Kernel K\u0303int (q, q\") is the Fourier\ntransform of the kernel (15) with respect to both arguments.

The first zero of \u2206 is obtained for the value 1.37\nof the coordinate.\n\ntal length is on the order of the Rayleigh range of the\nresonator, the transverse coherence length is on the order of the cavity waist. Recalling that the pump field\nhas a Gaussian shape of waist wp , in order to have a\nmultimode operation one must therefore use a defocussed\npump, with wp \u226b wc , or alternatively use a crystal much\nshorter than the Rayleigh range of the resonator, which is\ndetrimental for the oscillation threshold of the OPO. The\nrelevant scaling parameter of our problem is therefore\nb=\n\nwp2\nzp\n= 2ns ,\n2\nlcoh\nlc\n\n(19)\n\nwhere zp is the Rayleigh or diffraction length of the pump\nbeam. This parameter sets the number of spatial modes\nthat can be independently excited, and it will turn out to\ngive also the number of modes that can be independently\nsqueezed.\n\nw2\n\npump profile (1), i.e. \u00c3p (q) = 2p Ap exp (\u2212|q|2 4p ).\nThe result (22) can be also derived by solving the propagation equation of the pump and signal wave inside a\n\u03c7(2) crystal directly in the Fourier domain and in the\nlimit of weak parametric gain. We will follow here the\nsame approach as in [8] and [19], and write the propagation equation in terms of the spatio-temporal Fourier\ntransform field operators \u00c2j (q, \u03c9, z) of the pump (j = p)\nand signal (j = s) waves. Since the cavity linewidth is\nsmaller by several orders of magnitude than the typical\nfrequency bandwidth of the crystal, the cavity filters a\nvery small frequency bandwidth around the carrier frequency \u03c9s of the signal; moreover, we have assumed that\nthe pump is monochromatic, so that we can safely neglect the frequency argument in the propagation equations, which take the form\n\u2202 \u00c2j\n(q, z) = ikjz (q)\u00c2j (q, z) + P\u0302jN L (q, z) ,\n\u2202z\n\n(23)\n\nwhere P\u0302jN L is the nonlinear term, arising from the second\norder\nnonlinear susceptibility of the crystal. kjz (q) =\nq\n2\nkj \u2212 q 2 is the projection along the z-axis of the\n\n\f5\nwavevector, with kj = kj (\u03c9j , q) being the wave-number,\nwhich for extraordinary waves depends also on the propagation direction (identified by q). For the pump wave,\nwe assume an intense coherent beam, that we suppose\nundepleted by the parametric down-conversion process\nin a single pass through the crystal, so that\n\u00c2p (q, z) \u2192 \u00c3p (q, z) = eikpz (q)z Ap (q, 0) ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we take the crystal center as the reference plane\nz = 0. For the signal, the propagation equation is more\neasily solved by setting \u00c2s (q, z) = exp (iksz (q)z)\u00e2s (q, z).\nThe evolution along z of the operator \u00e2s is only due to the\nparametric interaction and is governed by the equation\n(see e.g.[8] and [19] for more details):\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c3\n\u2202\u00e2s\n(q, z) =\nd2 q \u2032 Ap (q + q\u2032 , 0)\u00e2\u2020s (q\u2032 , z)ei\u03b4(q,q )z ,\n\u2202z\nlc\n(25)\nwhere \u03c3/lc is the parametric gain per unit length, and\nwe have introduced the phase mismatch function\n\u03b4(q, q\u2032 ) = kpz (q + q\u2032 ) \u2212 ksz (q) \u2212 ksz (q\u2032 ).\n\n(26)\n\nEquation (25) has the formal solution\nlc\nlc\n\u03c3\n\u00e2s (q, ) = \u00e2s (q, \u2212 ) +\n2\n2\nlc\n\nZ\n\nlc\n2\n\n\u2212 l2c\n\ndz \u2032\n\nZ\n\nd2 q \u2032\n\nAp (q + q\u2032 , 0)\u00e2\u2020s (q\u2032 , z \u2032 )ei\u03b4(q,q )z . (27)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nAssuming a weak parametric efficiency \u03c3 \u226a 1, we can\nsolve this equation iteratively. At first order in \u03c3 the\nsolution reads:\nZ\nlc\nlc\n\u00e2s (q, ) = \u00e2s (q, \u2212 ) + \u03c3 d2 q \u2032 K1 (q, q\u2032 )\u00e2\u2020s (q\u2032 , 0) ,\n2\n2\n(28)\nwith\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 lc\nK1 (q, q ) = \u00c3p (q + q , 0)sinc \u03b4(q, q )\n.\n(29)\n2\nWe observe that in the paraxial approximation kjz (q) \u2248\nq2\nkj \u2212 \u03c1j * q \u2212 2k\n, where \u03c1j is the walk-off angle and kj =\nj\nnj \u03c9j /c. The phase mismatch function is hence given by:\n\u03b4(q, q\u2032 ) = kp \u2212 2ks + (\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1p ) * (q + q\u2032 )\n\u2212\n\n|q + q\u2032 |2\n1 2\n+\n(q + q \u20322 )\n2kp\n2ks\n\n(30)\n\nAssuming exact phase matching kp = 2ks , and neglecting\nthe walk-off term, the argument of the sinc function in\nEq.

Indeed, it is not difficult to\nshow that the variation of the intracavity field operator\nB\u0302+ (q, 0, t) per cavity round trip time \u03c4 , due to the parametric interaction in a single pass through the crystal\nis\nZ\n\u03c3\n1\n1\n\u2206B\u0302+ (q, 0, t)\n=\nd2 q \u2032 [K1 (q, q\u2032 )\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n2\nint\n\u2020\n+K1 (q, \u2212q\u2032 )] B\u0302+\n(q\u2032 , 0, t) .(32)\n\nThis approach permits us to understand the physical origin of the sinc terms in the coupling kernel of Eq. (22)\n(which are the Fourier transform of the \u2206 terms in Eq.\n(15)), that is the limited phase-matching bandwidth of\nthe nonlinear crystal. For a crystal of negligible length,\nphase matching is irrelevant and there is no limitation in\nthe spatial bandwidth of down-converted modes, whereas\nfor a finite crystal the cone of parametric fluorescence\nhas an aperture limited to a bandwidth\nof transverse\n\u221a\nwavevectors \u2206q \u2248 1/lcoh \u221d 1/ \u03bblc . As a consequence\nof the confocal geometry, the cavity ideally transmits all\nthe Fourier modes, so that the only limitation in spatial\nbandwidth is that arising from phase matching along the\ncrystal.\nWe notice that if the pump is defocussed enough, the\nphase-matching limitation results in a limitation of the\nspot size \u221d 1/lcoh in the far-field with respect to the cavity center. Inside this spot, modes are coupled because\nof the finite size of the pump beam (the terms \u221d A \u0303P in\nEq.(22)), inside a region of size \u221d wp\u22121 . The relevant parameter which sets the number of Fourier modes that can\n2\nbe independently excited is again given by b = wp2 /lcoh\n(see Eq. (19)).\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nHOMODYNE DETECTION AND\nSQUEEZING SPECTRUM\n\nHomodyne detection scheme in the far field and\nnear field\n\nThe method used for measuring the noise-spectrum\noutside the cavity is a balanced homodyne detection\nscheme [20]. We will use two configurations: the nearfield configuration (x-position basis described in II.B)\nand the far-field configuration (q-vector basis described\nin II.C). The complete detection scheme in the near-field\ncase is schematically shown in Fig. 3. The two matching\nlenses of focal length f image the crystal/cavity center\nplane C onto the detection planes D and D'. The image\nfocal plane F of the first lens coincides with the object\nfocal plane of the second one, and represents the far-field\nplane with respect to the cavity center C. In planes C,F,D\nthe signal field has its minimum waist, and it has a flat\nwavefront.\nThe detection scheme in the far field is obtained by\nusing only one lens as depicted in Fig. 4.

In this\ncase the electromagnetic fields are represented by vectors\nand the interaction terms by matrices. Straightforward\ncalculations show that we can introduce the interaction\nfunctions U (y, y \u2032 ) and V (y, y \u2032 ) (calculated at resonance\n\u2206 = 0 and at zero frequency in near-field or far-field configurations ) linking two different points in the transverse\nplane, so that relation (38) becomes:\nZ \u221e\nin \u2032\nout\n(y )\ndy \u2032 U (y, y \u2032 )B+\nB+ (y) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nin+ \u2032\ndy \u2032 V (y, y \u2032 )B+\n(y )\n\n(39)\n\nSince we assumed that the odd part of the output field\nout\nis in the vacuum state, B\u2212\ngives no contribution to the\nnormally ordered part of the spectrum S, which can be\ncalculated by using the input/output relation (21) for\nthe even part of the field, and by using the commutation\nrules for the even part:\nin/out\n\nin/out+\n\n[B\u00b1\n(x, t), B\u00b1\n(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )] =\n1\n[\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) \u00b1 \u03b4(x + x\u2032 )]\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n2\n\n(40)\n\nIn the following, we will assume, as in Refs.[13][12], that\nthe local oscillator has a constant phase profile \u03c6L (x) =\n\u03c6L , so that \u03b1L (x) = |\u03b1L (x)|ei\u03c6L .

As already said in\npart II, in the near field, the thick crystal couples pixels\ncontained in a region whose size is in the order of lcoh\n(18).\nLet us study first the case of a plane-wave pump and\na plane-wave local oscillator. As pointed out in ref[12],\nin this case and in the thin crystal approximation, the\nlevel of squeezing does not depend on the width of the\ndetection region. Fig. 5 shows results predicted for a\nmeasurement performed with a circular detector of radius\n\u25b3\u03c1 centered on the cavity axis (which is a symmetric\ndetection area, as pointed out in [13]). We represent the\nsqueezing spectrum at zero frequency as a function of\nthe sizeqof the detector, scaled to the coherence length\n\n\u03bblc\nlcoh = \u03c0n\n. We can see that for \u2206\u03c1 < lc , the squeezing\ns\ntends to zero when \u2206\u03c1 \u2212\u2192 0, as already predicted. For\nlarger values of the detector size, perfect squeezing can\nbe achieved. We can also see that the squeezing evolution\nis comparable to the \u25b3 function evolution (Fig. 2).\n\nh\n\n(V (x, y)V (x\u2032 , y) + V (x, y)V (x, \u2212y))\n\ni\n+ cos(2\u03c6L )(U (x, y)V (x\u2032 , y) + U (x, y)V (x\u2032 , \u2212y)) (41)\n\nIn the more realistic case of finite size pump, the\nsqueezing level depends on the parameter b =\nz\n2ns lcp ,\n\nwp2\nl2coh\n\n=\n\nas pointed out in part I. Fig. 6 represents the\nsqueezing spectrum at zero-frequency as a function the\ndetector radius, normalized to lcoh , for different b parameters, using a plane local oscillator. As already seen in\nFig. 5, for \u2206\u03c1 \u2212\u2192 0, the noise reduction effect tends\nto zero. But we see now that there is also no squeezing\neffect for large values of the detector radius, because of\nthe finite size of the pump, as already shown in [13].\nFig. 7 shows theoretical results in the case of a detector\nconsisting of two symmetric pixels (pixel of size equal to\nthe coherence length), for different b values, in function\nof the distance between the two pixels. For large values\nof \u03c1, the noise level goes back to shot noise because of the\nfinite size of the pump, as already depicted in reference\n[13]. But now, for small \u03c1 values, the squeezing does not\ntend to zero, as in the thin crystal case.\n\nV.\n\nSQUEEZING SPECTRUM IN THE\nFAR-FIELD\n\nIn this section, we will consider the spatial squeezing\nspectrum in the far field (Fig. 4) and in the q-vector\nbasis. As already said in section II.C, the coupling between q-vectors modes is now due to the finite length of\nthe pump.

This can be simply understood: the qvector basis is the eigenbasis of the diffraction, so that\nno coupling between q-vector modes due to the crystal\nappears.\nLet us now consider the homodyne-detection scheme,\nschematically shown in (Fig. 4). The lens provides a\nspatial Fourier transform of the output field Bout (x, \u03a9),\nD\nso that at the location of plane D the field Bout\n(x, \u03a9) is:\nD\nBout\n(x, \u03a9) =\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nB\u0303out ( x, \u03a9)\n\u03bbf\n\u03bbf\n\n(47)\n\nD\nIn this plane,Bout\n(x, \u03a9) is mixed with an intense station2\u03c0x\n2\u03c0\nary and coherent beam \u03b1D\nLO (x) = \u03bbf \u03b1\u0303LO ( \u03bbf , \u03a9), where\n\u03b1L (x) has a gaussian shape, with a waist wLO . The homodyne field has thus an expression similar to the near\nfield case, where functions of x are now replaced by their\nspatial Fourier transforms:\n\nEH (\u03a9) =\n(48)\nZ\ndq[B\u0303 out (q, \u03a9)\u03b1\u0303\u2217LO (q) + B\u0303 out+ (q, \u2212\u03a9)\u03b1\u0303LO (q)]\ndet\n\nThis analogy shows that, in the case of a local oscillator\nthat has an even parity with respect to coordinate inversion, the squeezing spectrum is given by (like in [13]):\nZ\ndq{|\u03b1\u0303LO (q)|2 [1 \u2212 \u03c3(q)]}\nV (\u03a9) =\ndet\nZ\ndq{|\u03b1\u0303LO (q)|2 \u03c3(q)R(q, \u03a9)} (49)\n+\ndet\n\nwhere the noise spatial density R(q, \u03a9) is given by:\nR(q, \u03a9) = |U(q, \u03a9) + e2i\u03c6LO (q) V\u2217 (q, \u2212\u03a9)|2\n\n(50)\n\nand where\n\u03c3(q) =\n\nZ\n\ndq'\u03b4+ (q, q')\n\n(51)\n\ndet\n\nIn order to minimize R(q, \u03a9), the local oscillator phase\narg[U(q,\u03a9)V (q,\u03a9)]\nshould be chosen as \u03c6LO (q) =\n. In par2\nticular, at resonance and at zero frequency U (q, 0) and\nV (q, 0) are real and the optimal local oscillator phase\nlc q2\nwould correspond to \u03c6LO (q) = \u03c02 , when sinc( 2k\n) \u2265\ns\nlc q2\n0, and \u03c6LO (q) = 0, when sinc( 2ks ) \u2264 0, which is\nnot indeed very practical. However, modes for which\n\nlc q 2\nsinc( 2k\n) \u2264 0 are quite outside the phase matching\ns\ncurve, so that the choice \u03c6LO (q) = \u03c02 everywhere should\ngive good results. The squeezing spectrum at resonance\nand zero frequency, for \u03c6LO (q) = \u03c02 can be analytically\ncalculated and, as a function of the radius r of a detector\ncentered on the optical axis is given by:\n\nV (r, 0)\n1\n(52)\n= R r/r\n2 k u2\n\u2212wLO\n0\ns\nN\nu\nexp(\n)\nlc\n0\n\u00132\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nZ r/ro\n2\n1 + Ap sinc(u2 )\n\u2212wLO\nks u2\nu exp\n\u2217\nlc\n1 \u2212 Ap sinc(u2 )\n0\nwhere\n\u03bbf\nr0 =\n2\u03c0\n\nr\n\n\u03bbf\n1\n2ks\n=\n\u2217\nlc\n\u03c0\nlcoh\n\n(53)\n\nFig. 8 shows the results obtained in the case of two different detection configurations: the V curve shows results in the case of a circular detector of variable radius r\n(scaled to r0 ), using a local oscillator waist wLO = r0 . As\nalready said in part II, the limitation of the squeezing\nlevel is due to the non perfect phase matching along the\ncrystal. For r > r0 , the squeezing level decreases. So, in\nthe plane wave pump regime in the far field, the thickness\nof the crystal has a role comparable with the finite size\nof the pump in the near field, as reported in [13]. The\nR curve shows results obtained in the case of two small\nsymmetrical pixels and a plane wave local oscillator as\na function of the pixel distance from the cavity axis r,\nscaled to r0 . We can see that the noise level goes back to\nthe shot noise level for r > r0 , because to the non perfect\nphase matching along the crystal.\n\nB.\n\nSqueezing spectrum in the far field case and\nfinite size pump regime\n\nWhen one takes into account the finite size of the\npump, a coupling between different q vectors appear, and\none needs to solve equations numerically, as in the near\nfield case. A new coherence length lcohf appears in the\nfar field: lcohf = w1P .\nFig. 9 shows the evolution of the squeezing spectrum at\nzero frequency, and at resonance, for different b parameters, in function of the detector radius scaled to lcohf\n. We see the same evolution as in the analytical case,\nexcept that the noise level tends to shot noise for small\nvalues of the detector.\nFig. 10 shows the results obtained in the case of two\nsymmetrical pixels (pixel of size equal to the coherence\nlength lcohf ), for different b values, in function of the distance between the two pixels \u03c1. The evolution is similar\nto the one given by fig(6) for large distances. But there\nis here also a decrease of the squeezing effect for small\ndistances.\n\n\f10\nb=100\nb=25\nb=1\n\n1.1\n\nV(\u03a9=0/N)\n\nV(0)/N\n\nR\n\nShot noise\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\nV\n\n0.8\n\nr/ro\n\n0\n\nFIG. 8: Squeezing spectrum normalized to the shot noise,at\nzero-frequency, at resonance, in the plane pump regime and\nfar field case, for two measurement configurations.

With the purpose of\nproducing a light beam that is squeezed in several elementary portions of its transverse cross-section, either a\ncrystal short compared to zR should be used or, alternatively, a defocussed pump, with a waist much larger\nthan the cavity waist. In both cases the efficiency of the\nnon linear coupling is reduced. For instance, with 1cm\nlong crystal, lcoh is equal to 40\u03bcm, and one must choose\na pump waist much larger than this value in order to observe multimode squeezing (the number of modes being\n\nb=1\nb=25\nb=100\n\n0.8\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u2206\u03c1/lcohf\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFIG. 9: Squeezing spectrum normalized to the shot noise at\nzero-frequency, and at resonance, as a function of the radial\namplitude of the detector \u2206\u03c1(scaled to the coherence area\nlcohf ), in the finite pump regime and far field approach and\nfor different values of b.\n\nroughly equal to the ratio b = l2 p ). This defocussed\ncoh\npump will imply a much higher threshold for the OPO\noscillation, which is multiplied by a factor also close to b.\nThe conclusion of this analysis is that one cannot have\nmultimode squeezing \"for free\", and that with a given\npump power, one will be able to to excite a number of\nmodes which is roughly equal to the ration of the injected\npump power to the threshold power for single mode operation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have seen that when one takes into account the\neffect of diffraction inside the nonlinear crystal in a confocal OPO, the local squeezing predicted for any shape\nand size of the detectors in the thin crystal approximation\nis now restricted to detection areas lying within a given\nrange, characterized by a coherence length lcoh .
