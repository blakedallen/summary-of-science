Introduction\nThe current generation of X-ray observatories, with their\nunprecedented spatial resolution (Chandra) and sensitivity\n(XMM-Newton), coupled to moderate (CCD) to high (gratings)\nspectral resolution, have made it feasible for the first time to\nstudy solar system objects in detail. Jupiter has a particularly\ncomplex magnetospheric environment, which is governed by\nits fast rotation and by the presence of Io and its dense plasma\ntorus. Not surprisingly the giant planet became a target of observations since the earliest attempts at X-ray studies of the solar system: Jupiter was first detected in X-rays with the Einstein\nobservatory (Metzger et al. 1983), and was later studied with\nROSAT (e.g. Waite et al. 1994).\nSend offprint requests\ngbr@mssl.ucl.ac.uk\n\nto:\n\nG.\n\nBranduardi-Raymont\n\ne-mail:\n\nBy analogy with the Earth's aurorae, Jupiter's X-ray emission was expected to be produced via bremsstrahlung radiation by energetic electrons precipitating from the magnetosphere and scattered by nuclei in the planet's upper atmosphere. However, the observed X-ray spectrum was softer\n(0.2\u22123 keV) and the observed fluxes higher than expected for\na bremsstrahlung origin, implying unrealistically high electron\ninput power with respect to that required to produce the UV aurora (Metzger et al. 1983). The alternative is K shell line emission from ions, mostly of oxygen, which are stripped of electrons while precipitating, and then charge exchange: the ions\nare left in an excited state from which they decay back to the\nground state with line emission (see Bhardwaj et al. 2006b for\na recent review of solar system X-ray observations and emission mechanisms). The origin of the precipitating ions was naturally postulated to be in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere, where\n\n\f2\n\nG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\nan abundance of sulphur and oxygen ions, associated with Io\nand its plasma torus, could be found (Metzger et al. 1983).\nThe latter alternative was given support by ROSAT soft X-ray\n(0.1\u22122.0 keV) observations which produced a spectrum much\nmore consistent with recombination line emission than with\nbremsstrahlung (Waite et al. 1994, Cravens et al. 1995).\nTo test the bremsstrahlung hypothesis, Waite (1991) and\nSinghal et al. (1992) carried out model calculations for the energy deposition by primary electrons with a Maxwellian energy distribution precipitating in Jupiter's upper atmosphere\nand producing secondary electrons by ionisation: both these\nworks indeed confirmed that the expected bremsstrahlung flux\nis smaller by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared with the\nobserved <2 keV X-ray flux. Singhal et al. concluded that only\nhigh-energy (>2 keV) X-ray observations could resolve the\nquestion of the identity and energy of the particles involved\nin producing the full spectrum of auroral emissions on Jupiter.\nThe XMM-Newton observations reported in the present paper\naddress precisely this issue.\nChandra observations have given us the sharpest view of\nJupiter's X-ray emission, but have also raised serious questions: HRC-I observations in Dec. 2000 and Feb. 2003 clearly\nresolve two bright, high-latitude sources associated with the aurorae, as well as diffuse low-latitude emission from the planet's\ndisk (Gladstone et al. 2002, Elsner et al. 2005, Bhardwaj et al.\n2006a). However, the Northern X-ray hot spot is found to be\nmagnetically mapped to distances in excess of 30 Jovian radii\nfrom the planet, rather than to the inner magnetosphere and\nthe Io plasma torus, as originally speculated (see Bhardwaj and\nGladstone 2000 for a review). Since in the outer magnetosphere\nion fluxes are insufficient to explain the observed X-ray emission, another ion source (likely the solar wind) may be contributing; in any case, an acceleration mechanism needs to be\npresent in order to boost the flux of energetic ions: potentials of\n\u223c200 kV and at least 8 MV are needed in case of a solar wind\nand magnetospheric origin respectively (Cravens et al. 2003).\nStrong 45 min quasi-periodic X-ray oscillations were also discovered by Chandra in the North auroral spot in Dec. 2000. No\ncorrelated periodicity was seen at the time in Cassini upstream\nsolar wind data, nor in Galileo and Cassini energetic particle\nand plasma wave measurements (Gladstone et al. 2002).\nThe Chandra 2003 ACIS-S observations (Elsner et al.\n2005) show that the auroral X-ray spectrum is made up of line\nemission consistent with high charge states of oxygen, with a\ndominant fraction of fully stripped ions. Line emission at lower\nenergies could be from sulphur (0.31\u22120.35 keV) and/or carbon (0.35\u22120.37 keV): were it from carbon, it would suggest a\nsolar wind origin. The high charge states imply that the ions\nmust have undergone acceleration, independently from their\norigin, magnetospheric or solar wind. Rather than periodic oscillations, chaotic variability of the auroral X-ray emission was\nobserved, with power peaks in the 20\u221270 min range; similar\npower spectra were obtained from the time history of Ulysses\nradio data taken at 2.8 AU from Jupiter at the time of the\nChandra observations (Elsner et al. 2005). A promising mechanism which could explain the change in character of the variability, from organised to chaotic, is pulsed reconnection at the\nday-side magnetopause between magnetospheric and magne-\n\ntosheath field lines, as suggested by Bunce et al. (2004). This\nprocess, occurring at the Jovian cusps, would work equally well\nfor ions of magnetospheric origin as for ions from the solar\nwind.\nWith its unparalleled photon collecting area up to \u223c10\nkeV XMM-Newton has the potential of providing high signalto-noise spectra with which to try and resolve some of the\nun-answered issues surrounding Jupiter and its environment.\nXMM-Newton has observed Jupiter twice: in Apr. 2003 (110 ks;\nBranduardi-Raymont et al. 2004, BR1 hereafter), and in Nov.\n2003 (245 ks).\nThe Apr. 2003 XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging\nCamera (EPIC) soft X-ray spectra of Jupiter's auroral spots can\nbe modelled with a combination of emission lines, including\nmost prominently those of highly ionised oxygen; however, unlike the Chandra ACIS-S spectra where the emission appears\nto be mostly from OVIII (0.65 keV, or 19.0 \u00c5), the EPIC data\nrequire a dominant contribution from OVII He-like transitions\n(0.57 keV, or \u223c22 \u00c5). A 2.8\u03c3 enhancement in the Reflection\nGrating Spectrometer (RGS) spectrum at 21\u221222 \u00c5 is consistent with the OVII identification. At lower energies the EPIC\nbest fit model includes an emission line centred at 0.36 \u00b1 0.02\nkeV for the North aurora and at 0.33+0.02\n\u22120.03 keV for the South,\nwhich would suggest a CVI Ly\u03b1 transition (0.37 keV) rather\nthan emission from SXI\u2212SXIII (0.32\u22120.35 keV). While this\nwould support a solar wind origin, BR1 point out that the rather\npoor statistical quality of the data make line discrimination uncertain.\nThe X-ray spectrum of Jupiter's low latitude disk regions\nis different, and matches that of solar X-rays scattered in the\nplanet's upper atmosphere (BR1; see also Maurellis et al. 2000,\nCravens et al. 2006). A temporal study of Jupiter's low latitude\ndisk emission during the Nov. 2003 XMM-Newton observation\nand of its relationship to the solar X-ray flux is presented in\nBhardwaj et al. (2005), while a spectral analysis of the disk\nemission is given in Branduardi-Raymont et al. (2006).\nHere we present a detailed study of Jupiter's auroral emissions from the analysis of the Nov. 2003 XMM-Newton observation, which we compare with that of Apr. 2003, and with the\nChandra data, as appropriate: Sect. 2 of this paper covers the\nanalysis of the temporal behaviour; in Sect. 3 we present EPIC\nimages in selected spectral bands; our modelling of the EPIC\nauroral spectra is described in Sect. 4, and the analysis of the\nRGS high resolution spectrum of the planet is reported in Sect.\n5. Discussion and conclusions follow in Sects 6 and 7 respectively.\n\n2.

Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\nand the OM (Optical Monitor) telescope (Mason et al. 2001)\nhad its filter wheel kept in the BLOCKED position, because of\nJupiter's optical brightness exceeding the safe limit for the instrument (thus no OM data were collected). Six pointing trims\nwere carried out during the observation to avoid degrading the\nRGS spectral resolution. As in Apr. 2003, Jupiter's motion\non the sky (16\u2032\u2032 /hr) was along the RGS dispersion direction,\nso that optimum separation between the two poles could be\nachieved (the planet's apparent diameter was 35.8\u2032\u2032 during the\nobservation).\nAfter re-registering all detected photons to the centre of Jupiter's disk, the data were analysed with the\nXMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS) v. 6.1\n(http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/sas/). EPIC images, lightcurves and\nspectra were extracted using the task xmmselect, selecting\nonly good quality events (FLAG = 0).\nFig. 1 (left) shows the image of Jupiter obtained combining\nall the data from the three EPIC cameras in the band 0.2\u22122 keV\n(where most of the planet's X-ray emission is detected); superposed are the rectangular boxes (North: 27\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 18\u2032\u2032 ; South: 24\u2032\u2032\n\u00d7 15\u2032\u2032 ; Equator: 52\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 15\u2032\u2032 ) used to extract auroral and low latitude disk lightcurves and spectra; the boxes are surrounded by\na circle of 27.5\u2032\u2032 radius, which defines the whole planet. The\nrectangles are rotated by 33o from the East-West direction in\norder to take into account the inclination of the planet's polar\naxis with respect to the RA-DEC reference frame; in this way\nthe extraction regions match better the morphology of Jupiter's\nemissions than the boxes aligned in RA and DEC used for the\nApr. 2003 observation (BR1), thus maximising efficiency in extracting the planetary emission from the different regions.\nPeriods when high particle background was affecting the\ndata were identified from the lightcurve (top panel of Fig. 2, in\n100 s bins) of >10 keV events detected over the common fields\nof view (30\u2032 diameter) of the EPIC-MOS and pn cameras combined. Excluding these intervals, which are evident in Fig. 2 at\nthe beginning and/or end of each spacecraft orbit, leaves 210\nks of good quality data on which all subsequent analysis was\ncarried out.\nThe 0.2\u22122 keV lightcurves (5 min bins) from the combined\nEPIC detectors for the disk and the auroral spots are shown\nin Fig. 2 (second, third and fourth panel from the top, respectively). The planet's 10 hr rotation period is clearly visible in\nthe lightcurve of the North and South auroral spots, but not so\nin the disk emission. The modulation appears to be stronger\nduring the first XMM-Newton revolution, especially for the\nSouth aurora. Amplitude spectra generated from the data are\nshown in Fig. 3: a very significant peak, centred at 600 min, is\npresent in both the North and South auroral spot power spectra\n(with clear sidelobes in the North spot, and beat peaks at 200\nand 300 min); for the low latitude disk emission (Equator in\nFig. 3) the level of power rises for periods longer than \u223c300\nmin, but without the structure seen in the spots: this power\nmay reflect some mixing (see Sect. 4) of auroral emission with\nthe disk. There is a 10% decrease in the average soft X-ray\nflux from both aurorae between the first and the second spacecraft revolution; instead a 40% increase, noticeable in Fig. 2,\ntakes place in the equatorial flux: this is found to be correlated with a similar increase in solar X-ray flux (see Bhardwaj\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Jupiter's lightcurves from the combined EPIC-pn and\nMOS cameras for the Nov. 2003 XMM-Newton observation.\nThe gap of \u223c60 ks centred at 1.5 \u00d7 105 s into the observation\nis due to the spacecraft perigee passage between revs 0726 and\n0727.

'Disk', 'North aurora' and 'South aurora' are the\n0.2\u22122 keV low latitude disk emission, North and South auroral\nspots, respectively (from extraction regions in Fig. 1, in 5 min\nbins). 'CML': System III Central Meridian Longitude.\n\net al. 2005 for a detailed study of the temporal behaviour of\nthe low latitude disk emission, which appears to be controlled\nby the Sun). The bottom panel in Fig. 2 shows the System III\nCentral Meridian Longitude (CML). The North spot is brightest around CML = 180o , just like Chandra found in both Dec.\n2000 and Feb. 2003 (Gladstone et al. 2002, Elsner et al. 2005).\nThe South spot peaks earlier than the North one by \u223c90o , i.e.\nby a quarter of the planet's rotation, again similar to what seen\nby Chandra (Elsner et al. 2005). Chandra also found the South\nauroral emission to extend in a band rather than being concentrated in a spot. It is hard to test this with XMM-Newton given\nits lower spatial resolution; the peaks in the lightcurve of the\nSouth spot, though, appear more diluted than those in the North\nin Fig. 2, which may be in line with a more spread-out emitting\nregion.\nA search for periodic or quasi-periodic variability on short\ntimescales in the auroral emissions, of the type observed by\nChandra in Dec. 2000 and Feb. 2003, gives a null result (as for\nthe Apr. 2003 XMM-Newton data; BR1): there is no evidence\nof any enhancement below 100 min in the amplitude spectra\nof Fig. 3. While it is possible that pulsations were simply absent in Jupiter's aurorae at the time, we cannot exclude that the\nbroader XMM-Newton Point Spread Function (PSF, \u223c15\u2032\u2032 Half\nEnergy Width, or HEW) with respect to that of the Chandra\nHigh Resolution Camera (\u223c0.5\u2032\u2032 ) diluted the auroral X-ray\nemission with that from the planet's low latitudes to the extent of masking any periodic (or quasi-periodic) behaviour. No\nperiodic or quasi-periodic oscillations have been observed by\nChandra in the low latitude disk emission of Jupiter (Bhardwaj\net al. 2006a) and none are found here.\n\n\f4\n\nG.

Amplitude spectra generated from the lightcurves in\nFig. 2\n\nAlthough most of the X-ray emission of Jupiter is confined to\nthe 0.2\u22122 keV band, a search at higher energies has produced\nvery interesting results. Fig. 1 (right) is an image of Jupiter in\nthe 3\u221210 keV band, which shows the presence of high energy\nemission from the auroral spots, but not so from the planet's\ndisk. A more detailed view of the auroral contributions at different energies (in the bands 0.2\u22121, 1\u22123, 3\u22125 and 5\u221210 keV\nrespectively) is given in Fig. 5. Interestingly, the South spot is\nbrighter than the North spot above 3 keV.\n\n4. EPIC spectra\n3. EPIC spectral images\n\n3.1. Emission line imaging\nThe first observation of Jupiter by XMM-Newton in Apr. 2003\n(BR1) indicated that the auroral X-ray spectra can be modelled\nwith a superposition of emission lines, including most prominently those of highly ionised oxygen (OVII, at 0.57 keV, and\nOVIII Ly\u03b1, 0.65 keV). Instead, Jupiter's low-latitude X-ray\nemission displays a spectrum consistent with that of solar Xrays scattered in the planet's upper atmosphere; predominant\ncomponents of this emission are lines from FeXVII transitions\n(at \u223c0.7 and 0.8 keV) and MgXI (1.35 keV, BR1).\nFig. 4 displays EPIC images from the Nov. 2003 XMMNewton observation in narrow spectral bands centred on the\nOVII, OVIII, FeXVII and MgXI lines: the OVII emission peaks\n\n4.1. Extraction of the spectra\nEPIC CCD data of Jupiter's auroral zones and of the lowlatitude disk emission suffer 'spectral mixing' due to the relatively broad XMM-Newton PSF (\u223c15\u2032\u2032 HEW, practically independent of energy; see also BR1). Fig. 1 shows the regions\nused to extract the auroral and disk spectra, overposed to the\nEPIC images of Jupiter. We approached the task of separating\nthe spectra of the different regions in two ways.\nFirst we extracted spectra for the auroral regions, and then\nselected only sections of the corresponding lightcurves where\nthe X-ray flux is higher than a given level. This is in practice\nphase spectroscopy, and results in selecting only phases where\nthe spots are in maximum view, thus minimising contamination\nfrom the disk emission. By doing so we get insight to the shape\n\n\fG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\n5\n\nFig. 4. Smoothed XMM-Newton EPIC images of Jupiter in narrow spectral bands: From top left, clockwise: OVII, OVIII, Mg XI,\nFe XVII. The colour scale bar is in units of EPIC counts. The image of the planet appears slightly smaller than in Fig. 1 because\nof the different colour contrast. A graticule showing Jupiter's orientation with 30o intervals in latitude and longitude is overlaid.\nThe circular mark with a dot indicates the sub-solar point; the sub-Earth point is at the centre of the graticule.\nof the true spectrum of the aurorae, but we artificially inflate\nthe flux measurement, in a way that is difficult to correct; this\nis especially problematic because we want to combine all three\nEPIC cameras data to maximise the statistical quality of the\nspectra. Also, in order to extract the true disk emission without contamination by the aurorae, we ought to restrict the data\nselection to unrealistically short periods of the lightcurve (see\nFig. 2).\nThus, for the proper spectral analysis we proceeded in a\ndifferent way: we simulated the expected XMM-Newton image of Jupiter by convolving the XMM-Newton PSF at 0.5 keV\n(the planet's X-ray emission peaks in the soft band) with the\nsummed Chandra ACIS-S and HRC-I surface brightness distribution (Elsner et al. 2005), and then calculated the number of\n\nevents contributed to the XMM-Newton extraction boxes (this\npaper, Fig. 1); this procedure is justified because the relative\nstrengths of the various spectral components do not vary very\nsignificantly over time. The same was done for events between\n1.05 and 5 \u00d7 1.05 Jupiter radii from the planet's centre in the\nACIS image in order to get an estimate of the contribution\nof off-planet events to the XMM-Newton boxes (under the assumption that the background is similar for the two spacecraft).\nKnowing the total number of events in the Chandra selection\nregions, we could then calculate the percentage of events in\neach Chandra region that contribute to each XMM-Newton extraction box. The results are shown in Table 1. From this we\nsee that we can expect mixing of disk and background events\nwith auroral ones, and even a small amount of mixing of North\n\n\f6\n\nG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\nFig. 5. Smoothed XMM-Newton EPIC images of Jupiter in different bands extending to higher energies: From top left, clockwise:\n0.2\u22121, 1\u22123, 5\u221210 and 3\u22125 keV. The colour scale bar is in units of EPIC counts. The image of the planet appears slightly smaller\nthan in Fig. 1 because of the different colour contrast. A graticule is overlaid as in Fig. 4.\nand South events in the South and North boxes respectively.\nUsing these results it has been possible to prescribe equations\nwhich recover the spectra for Jupiter's three extraction regions.\nIn order to maintain the 'de-mixing' task manageable, we only\nsubtracted the appropriate fractions of disk and auroral spectra from the aurorae and disk respectively, and ignored the less\nsignificant contributions, i.e. mixing of off-planet background\nevents and aurora-aurora contamination.\nWe did not subtract the diffuse cosmic background from the\nspectra because Jupiter is foreground to it, nor the residual particle background, which is <1% of Jupiter's flux in the band\n0.2\u22122 keV. However, the particle background becomes a significantly higher fraction of the flux at higher energies. This is\ndiscussed in Sect. 4.2.\n\nTable 1.

Comparison of the Nov. 2003 EPIC-pn spectra of the\nNorth aurora obtained with two different extraction techniques:\n'Phase spectroscopy' (black) and 'De-mixing' (red).

The de-mixed spectrum has a lower flux\nbecause, correctly, is averaged over all flux levels of the source.\nThe general shape is very similar, which suggests that our demixing stategy is working. So we used the de-mixed spectra\nthroughout the following spectral analysis.\n\n4.2. North and South auroral spectra\nBefore starting detailed spectral fitting, we compared the spectra from the combined EPIC-pn and MOS-1 and -2 cameras,\nextending to the 10 keV upper bound of the instrumental responses, for Jupiter's three extraction regions. We used the\ntechnique described in Page et al. (2003) to combine the spectra from the different cameras, and the corresponding response\nmatrices; these, and the auxiliary response files, had been built\nusing the SAS tasks rmfgen and arfgen with the point source\noption (following the technique used in BR1).\nFig. 7 shows the North and South spots and the low latitude\ndisk spectra, after de-mixing: as first pointed out by BR1, there\nare clear differences in the shape of the spectra, with the auroral emission peaking at lower energy (0.5\u22120.6 keV) than the\ndisk (0.7\u22120.8 keV). Emission features in the range 1\u22122 keV\nare visible in all the spectra, but are stronger in the disk (see\nBranduardi-Raymont et al. 2006 for a detailed analysis of the\ndisk spectrum). The presence of a high energy component (>2\nkeV) from the aurorae is indeed confirmed, while this is missing in the disk emission. The 2\u221210 keV count rate is 6%, 14%\nand 5% of that in the 0.2\u22122 keV for North, South and equatorial regions respectively. The horizontal line in Fig. 7 represents\nthe estimated level of the particle background for the combined\nEPIC cameras: the disk emission dips into it at \u223c3 keV, while\nthe signal from the aurorae is well above the line out to \u223c7 keV.\nThe EPIC particle background level was estimated from the\n\n7\n\nFig. 7. Combined Nov. 2003 EPIC spectra of the North (black)\nand South (red) aurorae, and of the low latitude disk (green)\nspectrum. Differences in spectral shape between auroral and\ndisk spectra are clear. The presence of a high energy component in the spectra of the aurorae is very evident, with a substantial excess relative to the disk emission extending to 7 keV.\nThe horizontal blue line shows the estimated level of the EPIC\nparticle background.\n\nanalysis of Lumb (2002), and was verified for the Jupiter observation by examination of the flux measured in regions of the\nEPIC-MOS cameras outside the telescope field of view. This\nbackground is known to have an essentially flat distribution out\nto the highest energies (Lumb 2002). Unfortunately we do not\nhave a precise measurement of its level in the EPIC-pn camera during the Jupiter observation, which prevents us from subtracting it from the combined EPIC spectra. However, in the\nde-mixing process some 20\u221230% of the particle background\nis automatically taken away, so we do not expect the residual\nbackground to affect significantly our high energy results. In\nparticular, the fits will be mostly constrained by the parts of the\nspectra with the highest signal to noise, i.e. by the low energy\nspectral channels.\n\n4.3. Variability\nAnother issue to consider, in addition to the spectral complexity\nalready discussed, is that of variability: we have already seen\nthat the lightcurves in Fig. 2 show a 40% increase in the disk\nemission between XMM-Newton revs 0726 and 0727. Figs 8\nand 9 show combined EPIC North and South auroral spectra respectively, accumulated separately over the two XMMNewton orbits in Nov. 2003, together with the spectra from the\nApr. 2003 observation (BR1). The latter have been re-analysed\nusing the extraction regions in Fig. 1 and the de-mixing technique as for the Nov. 2003 data.\nThe North and South auroral spectra from the three datasets\nhave very similar overall shapes (this reinforces the validity of\nour spectral de-mixing). However, both North and South spectra from rev. 0726 show a larger flux (by a factor of \u223c2) in the\nhigh energy component at 4\u22127 keV; also between 0.3 and 0.4\n\n\f8\n\nG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\na line at \u223c1.35 keV, with variable strength, is clearly present\nonly in the North. A MgXI line (actually a He-like triplet, unresolved at the EPIC resolution) appears at this energy in the\nsolar coronal spectrum at times of strong activity (Peres et al.\n2000), suggesting that we are seeing some disk contamination\nin Jupiter's aurorae.\n\n4.4. Spectral fits\n\nFig. 8. Combined EPIC spectra of the North aurora for the\ntwo separate XMM-Newton revolutions, 0726 (black) and 0727\n(red), in Nov. 2003, and for the Apr. 2003 observation (blue).\n\nFig. 9. Combined EPIC spectra of the South aurora for the\ntwo separate XMM-Newton revolutions, 0726 (black) and 0727\n(red), in Nov. 2003, and for the Apr. 2003 observation (blue).\n\nkeV the flux appears higher (especially for the South aurora)\nthan those in Apr. 2003 and Nov. 2003, rev. 0727: in fact, the\nspectra at these two epochs are remarkably similar to each other\nfor both aurorae despite the seven month gap between them.\nWe have checked the stability of the particle background level\nbetween the two Nov. 2003 revolutions in regions of the EPICMOS cameras outside the telescope field of view and conclude\nthat the flux changes at high energy are intrinsic to the aurorae.\nThe trend of the auroral emission variability between the\ntwo Nov. 2003 XMM-Newton revolutions, with enhancements\nat both low and high energies in the first part of the observation,\nis opposite to that of the disk emission, which increases by 40%\nbetween revs 0726 and 0727 (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the\nidea that different mechanisms are responsible for the origin of\nthe X-rays in the auroral and low latitude regions (BR1). Apart\nfrom the strong OVII emission line at 0.57 keV (BR1), features\nat \u223c0.8 keV are visible in both North and South spectra, while\n\nGiven the detailed differences in the spectra collected at different times for the various regions, we analysed the two Nov.\n2003 revolutions and re-analysed the Apr. 2003 data separately\nand then compared the results. We restricted spectral fitting of\nthe auroral emissions to the 0.2\u22127 keV range, to minimise the\npossibility of particle background contamination becoming an\nissue. The spectra were binned so as to have at least 40 counts\nper channel, well above the limit at which the \u03c72 minimisation\ntechnique is applicable in the fits. These were carried out with\nXSPEC v. 11.3.2.\nFollowing the original analysis of the Apr. 2003 observation (BR1), we started by fitting a combination of continuum\nmodels and emission lines to the auroral data of the Apr. 2003\nand Nov. 2003, revs 0726 and 0727, individual datasets. Since\nwe have used a different (and more accurate) spectral extraction technique and we are fitting also the high energy part of\nthe spectra, which was ignored in the original analysis of the\nApr. 2003 observations, we could expect to obtain results that\nslightly differ from those reported in BR1. We tried both thermal bremsstrahlung and power law models for the continuum,\nand we included four and five emission lines in our trials. We\nfirst left all model parameters free in the fits, and found that\na two bremsstrahlung continuum is a better fit than a single\nbremsstrahlung or a single power law for all the datasets. In all\ncases four gaussian lines are required to explain the emission\nfeatures: their best fit energies are 0.32, 0.57, 0.69 and 0.83\nkeV for the rev. 0726 spectra; in rev. 0727 and in Apr. 2003\nthe lowest energy line is not detected, but one is clearly present\nat 1.35 keV (probable disk contamination; see Sect. 4.3). The\n90% confidence range for the 0.32 keV line is 0.23\u22120.37 and\n0.21\u22120.35 keV for the North and South aurora respectively. We\nthen fixed the line energies and widths at the best fit values (the\nline widths are smaller or comparable to the EPIC camera resolution of \u223c100 eV FWHM) and refitted the data; in this way\nwe limit the number of free parameters in fits with relatively\nsmall numbers of spectral bins and are able to achieve an estimate of the free parameters uncertainties. Table 2 lists best\nfit parameters and 90% confidence errors, and allows us to inspect the differences between the Nov. 2003, rev. 0726 spectra and those from the two other epochs: the former require\nmuch higher temperature bremsstrahlung continua in order to\ndescribe the excess at high energies; an emission line is also\nneeded to explain a peak at 0.3\u22120.4 keV (the emission in this\nrange is better modelled with a cooler bremsstrahlung continuum at the other two epochs), while, as already mentioned, a\nline at 1.35 keV is detected in Apr. and Nov. 2003, rev. 0727\nonly. The large errors, especially on the line equivalent widths,\n\n\fG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\n9\n\nTable 2.

In fact, closer inspection of the Nov. 2003, rev. 0726 spectra with the best fit model\noverposed shows that the slope of the high energy tail is not\nproperly fitted. A much better fit (in appearence, if not in the\nstatistical sense, since the reduced \u03c72 values are below 1) is obtained substituting the high temperature bremsstrahlung with a\nflat power law (whose parameters are listed in Table 3). Figs 10\nand 11 show the spectra and these best fits for the Nov. 2003,\nrev. 0726 observation of the North and South aurorae respectively.\nTable 4 lists the 0.2\u22122.0 and 2.0\u22127.0 keV energy fluxes\nfor both aurorae in Nov. 2003, revs 0726 and 0727, and in\n\n\u03c72 value and degrees of freedom\nBremsstrahlung temperature in keV\nc\nBremsstrahlung normalisation at 1 keV in units of 10\u22126 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121\nkeV\u22121\nd\nEnergy of the emission features in keV (fixed in the fits)\ne\nTotal flux in the line in units of 10\u22126 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121\nf\nLine equivalent width in eV\nb\n\nApr. 2003. We first note that the fluxes derived for the two\nbremsstrahlungs and the bremsstrahlung + power law models\n(rev. 0726) are fairly similar, as one would expect since the fits\nare statistically equally good; the differences can be taken as\nan indication of the uncertainties affecting the results. While\nthe North aurora is always between 60 and 90% brighter than\nthe South in the 0.2\u22122 keV range, the two aurorae are comparable in flux in the 2\u22127 keV range: this is consistent with\nwhat we see in Fig. 5, where the South aurora even outshines\n\n\f10\n\nG.

Finally, Table 4 confirms the\nfactor of \u223c2 decrease in strength of the high energy component\nin both aurorae between revs 0726 and 0727, while the Apr.\n2003 level lies in between the two. The behaviour is different\nin the range 0.2\u22122 keV, where the energy flux of the North\naurora is larger in rev. 0727, and both aurorae are brightest\nin Apr. 2003: this is at odds with the decrease by \u223c10% observed in the lightcurves between revs 0726 and 0727 (Fig. 2\nand Sect. 2), and probably reflects a change in spectral shape\n(Table 2). The combined North and South auroral luminosities\nin the 0.2\u22122 keV band are 0.48, 0.41 and 0.46 GW in Apr. and\nNov. 2003, revs 0726 and 0727, respectively. As a comparison,\nin Feb. 2003 Chandra ACIS measured an X-ray luminosity of\n0.68 GW from the North aurora in the energy range 0.3\u22121 keV\n(Elsner et al. 2005).\nFig. 12 shows the high energy continuum model components fitted to the Nov. 2003 auroral data (flat power law for\nrev. 0726 and steeper bremsstrahlung for rev. 0727) and compares them with the predictions of Singhal et al. (1992) for\nbremsstrahlung emissions by electrons with characteristic energies between 10 and 100 keV. The bremsstrahlung fits of rev.\n0727 for both the North and South aurorae lie remarkably close\nto the predicted spectra; the same is true for the models fitted\nto the Apr. 2003 data, which are not shown to avoid making the\ndiagram too crowded. The models for rev. 0726, however, are\nvery much at variance with the predictions, and suggest a very\ndifferent electron distribution for both aurorae. For all datasets\n(Apr. and Nov. 2003) essentially all the observed flux at >2\nkeV (and a maximum of 10% of that between 0.2 and 2 keV)\nis accounted for by the high energy auroral components.

(1992) and the upper limits determined by Hurley et al. (1993) with the Ulysses\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) instrument in the 27\u221248 keV band. If\nwe adopt the best fit values of bremsstrahlung temperature and\nnormalisation found for rev. 0727, the combined output of the\nNorth and South aurorae in the 27\u221248 keV range corresponds\nto a luminosity of 4.3 MW: this compares well with Waite et al.\n(1992) most optimistic prediction of 3.3 MW and is consistent\nwith the GRB most stringent upper limit (< 100 MW) (Hurley\net al. 1993). If instead we extrapolate the Apr. 2003 best fit,\nwe obtain a luminosity \u223c10 times larger, still consistent with\nthe Hurley et al. upper limits. Using the best fit parameters for\nrev. 0726, extrapolation of the very flat power law leads to a\nluminosity \u223c2 GW, clearly in excess of predictions and upper\nlimits. This extreme result, however, could be mitigated if the\nspectral slope (determined over the narrow energy band 2\u22127\nkeV), and thus the electron energy distribution, has a downturn\nbelow \u223c50 keV.\n\n4.5. Combined Apr. and Nov. 2003 spectra\nIn an attempt to establish more accurately the energy, and thus\nthe origin, of the soft X-ray line present in the EPIC spectra\n\n\fG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\nFig. 12. High energy model components fitted to the Nov.\n2003 auroral data, compared with Singhal et al. (1992)\nbremsstrahlung X-ray flux predictions for three characteristic\nelectron energies (10, 30 and 100 keV, from bottom to top\ncurve). The Apr. 2003 models lie close to the predictions and\nare not shown to avoid crowding the diagram.\nat \u223c0.3 keV, we first combined all the data of the North aurora from the two observing campaigns, then we combined the\nSouth aurora data with them too (using the technique described\nby Page et al. 2003; Sect. 4.2), and analysed the resulting spectra. In the first case (all data for the North aurora) we find a\nbest fit line energy of 0.32 keV, and in the second (North and\nSouth aurorae combined) of 0.30 keV. Even with the increased\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the data, it is very difficult to establish\nthe energy of the feature securely. Figs 8 and 9 show that there\nare changes in the shape of the low energy spectrum over the\ndatasets, especially in the South aurorae, which contribute to\nthe uncertainty of the results. As a final trial, we combined\nthe North and South aurora data for the individual epochs and\n+0.03\nre-fitted, obtaining a best fit energy of 0.31+0.03\n\u22120.06 , 0.30\u22120.08 and\n+0.01\n0.30\u22120.06 keV for Apr. and Nov. 2003, revs 0726 and 0727, respectively. Thus, only by combining both auroral spectra can\nwe detect the line in two of the three datasets. The best fit model\nfor rev. 0726 in the range 0.2\u22122 keV is shown in Fig. 13. We\nconclude that the results of the analysis of the Nov. 2003 data\nand of the re-analysis of those from Apr. 2003 are more consistent with SXI (0.32 keV) or SXII (0.34 keV) transitions than\nCVI (0.37 keV), although only data at higher sensitivity and\nspectral resolution will provide the definite answer and separate the ion species involved.\n\n5. RGS spectra\nAfter re-registration to Jupiter's frame of reference, good quality RGS data from the Nov. 2003 XMM-Newton observation\nwere selected by excluding intervals of high background from\nfurther analysis. Fig. 14 shows the spectrum of Jupiter obtained\nby combining the RGS1 and 2 first order data from both XMMNewton revolutions in Nov. 2003: along the vertical axis is the\n\n11\n\nFig. 13.

Y-axis: Spatial extent of the emission in\nthe cross dispersion direction (colour coded such that light blue\nand green represent brighter pixels); x-axis: X-ray wavelength.\nThe two dashed horizontal lines mark the approximate location of Jupiter's aurorae (the planet's N\u2212S axis is essentially\nperpendicular to the RGS dispersion direction, with N at the\nbottom of the figure).\nspatial distribution of the emission in the cross dispersion direction (colour coded according to the detected flux), while Xray wavelength is plotted along the horizontal axis. Because\nthe cross dispersion coordinate for every event is referred to\nspacecraft on-axis, and Jupiter was 25\u2032\u2032 off-axis during the observation, its centre is shifted downwards from the zero level by\nthe same amount. The RGS clearly separates the emission from\nOVII (the triplet at 21.6\u221222.1 \u00c5, or 0.56\u22120.57 keV), OVIII Ly\u03b1\n(19.0 \u00c5, or 0.65 keV) and FeXVII (15.0 and \u223c17.0 \u00c5, or \u223c0.73\nand 0.83 keV).\nInterestingly, the RGS spectrum also shows evidence for\nthe different spatial extension of the line emitting regions, in\nagreement with the EPIC spectral mapping of Fig. 4: OVII pho-\n\n\f12\n\nG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\ntons are well separated spatially into the two aurorae, while\nthe other lines are filling in the low latitude/cross dispersion\nrange. In particular, this is true for the FeXVII lines at 15 and\n17 \u00c5, which are known to be associated with the planet's disk\nand are thought to be scattered solar X-rays (BR1, Maurellis et\nal. 2000, Cravens et al. 2006). Unfortunately, the combination\nof lower RGS sensitivity and low source flux at the short and\nlong wavelength ends of the instrument operational range is\nsuch that Jupiter's spectrum is only significantly detected in the\nrange 13\u221223 \u00c5 (0.54\u22120.95 keV), to which we have restricted\nsubsequent spectral fitting.\nSpectral distributions were extracted using the SAS task\nrgsspectrum, which selects source and background events\nfrom spatial regions adjacent in cross-dispersion direction.\nSince Jupiter is an extended source (although small enough not\nto degrade the RGS energy resolution significantly) the selection area for its spectrum was augmented (from the standard\nvalue of 90%) to include 95% of the RGS PSF in the crossdispersion direction, corresponding to a size of 87\u2032\u2032 on the sky.\nNo background subtraction was carried out, as in the EPIC\ncase, because Jupiter is a foreground object. After the spatial\nselection is carried out, rgsspectrum applies the RGS dispersion relation to further select true X-ray photons on the basis\nof their CCD energy values. RGS1 and 2 first order spectra,\nand corresponding matrices, were then combined according to\nthe same procedure followed for the EPIC spectra (Sect. 4.2).\nThe final spectrum was grouped by a factor of 3, resulting in\nchannels \u223c30 m\u00c5 wide, which still sample well the RGS resolution of \u223c70 m\u00c5 FWHM. Modelling of the RGS spectrum\nwas carried out with SPEX 2.00.11 (Kaastra et al. 1996).\nWe started by adopting a composite model including\na plasma in collisional ionisation equilibrium (to represent\nJupiter's disk emission and account in particular for the FeXVII\nline emission), a thermal bremsstrahlung component and gaussian emission lines at the wavelengths of the OVII triplet and\nOVIII Ly\u03b1 (to account for the auroral emission from ion charge\nexchange): this falls short of explaining the broad wings of the\noxygen lines, which are clearly evident in the RGS data (blue\ncrosses) shown in Figs 15 and 16. Only by adding two broad\ngaussian components centred on the OVII and OVIII emissions\ncan we achieve an acceptable fit. In the final best fit (\u03c72 = 360\nfor 280 d.o.f.) we also included gaussian lines corresponding\nto higher order OVII and OVIII transitions, to help modelling\nsome residual emission still un-accounted for.\nThe only parameters left free to vary in the fit were the\nnormalisations of all the model components, and the wavelengths and widths of the broad gaussians. The temperature\nof the disk plasma was fixed at 0.41 keV, which is the average of the values measured over the two XMM-Newton revolutions in Nov. 2003 (Branduardi-Raymont et al. 2006), and\nthe bremsstrahlung temperature was set to 0.2 keV, again the\naverage measured by EPIC over the two revolutions for the\nNorth and South aurorae (Table 2). Since the fits are insensitive to altering the intrinsic widths of the narrow gaussian\nlines, these were fixed at 0.1 \u00c5 (the planet's spatial extension\nbroadens the lines by \u223c80 m\u00c5).

We have searched for possible changes\nin the centroids of the oxygen features as the aurorae move in\nand out of view, to try and investigate their dynamics further,\nbut unfortunately the data signal-to-noise is too low.\nFig. 15 shows the combined RGS spectrum and the best fit\nmodel derived above, while Fig. 16 displays the data and only\nthe disk model component.\nVisual comparison of the RGS spectrum and of the model\nfits in Figs 15 and 16 provides interesting insights. The RGS\nclearly resolves the two FeXVII lines at 15.01 and 15.27 \u00c5,\nand those at 16.77 and 17.10 \u00c5. The flux observed around the\n15.27 \u00c5 line is much larger than predicted from the disk only\nspectrum, so the fit forces an unrealistically large contribution\nfrom OVIII Ly\u03b3 (15.18 \u00c5) compared to those of lower order\n\n\fG.

Letting the disk temperature free in the fit\ndrives it to a higher value (0.66 keV) but does not alleviate the\nproblem. Examination of the individual RGS spectra from revs\n0726 and 0727 indicates that the flux at 15.27 \u00c5 was about a\nfactor of two larger in the latter, suggesting that variability may\nbe contributing to the discrepancy, since the disk component\nwas modelled with the spectrum averaged over the two revolutions.\nThere is some evidence that the OVII triplet may be resolved, with high flux points at the locations of the resonance\n(21.60 \u00c5) and forbidden (22.10 \u00c5) lines, but the profile is complicated by the presence of the broad component which may be\nfilling in between the two lines.\nThe narrow OVIII Ly\u03b1 emission appears to be completely\naccounted for in the disk spectrum, so that we only derive an\nupper limit for any additional gaussian contribution of auroral origin (Table 5). For the strong auroral OVII emission at\n\u223c22 \u00c5, however, the situation is reversed: the disk contribution\n(Fig. 16) is very small, so essentially all the emission must be\nproduced by charge exchange in the aurorae.\n\n13\n\nFig. 17. Combined RGS 1 and 2 spectrum of Jupiter for different widths of the spatial extraction region in the cross dispersion dimension (half width of 8, 26 and 43\u2032\u2032 from bottom to\ntop).\nBecause of the spatial extent of Jupiter emission in the RGS\ncross dispersion dimension, we can try and extract more information on the different spectral components by comparing the\nspectra obtained selecting spatial bands of different cross dispersion width.\nFig. 17 shows the combined RGS1 and 2 spectra extracted\nover bands of cross dispersion half width of 8, 26 and 43\u2032\u2032 from\nbottom to top respectively; the narrowest band is expected to\nbe dominated by the disk spectrum, while the largest one will\ncontain both, disk and auroral emissions. Some interesting differences are apparent: the profile of the OVII triplet from the\nnarrowest band peaks at the position of the resonance line (21.6\n\u00c5) while in both the larger bands the profile is more flat-topped,\nsuggesting a more significant contribution by the forbidden line\nin the aurorae. The strength, and in particular the width, of the\nOVIII line at 19 \u00c5 increase dramatically by widening the extraction region, as more of the aurorae are included, while the\nappearence of the disk Fe lines is very similar in all regions,\nsuggesting that the emission must be concentrated predominantly in the inner, narrower extraction band.\n\n6. Discussion\nOur XMM-Newton observations of the auroral X-ray emissions\nof Jupiter provide important new insights in the physical phenomena taking place on the planet, in its interactions with the\nmagnetospheric plasma that surrounds it and in the effects that\nsolar activity has on them. We summarise and discuss our main\nfindings in the following sections, separating the ion and electron components which dominate at the low and high energy\nends of the EPIC spectra respectively, and which are found to\nbe variable. We conclude with a discussion of the RGS data and\ntheir implications.\n\n6.1. The ion component\nThe EPIC spectra from Nov. 2003 and the re-analysis of the\nApr. 2003 data confirm most of the results of BR1: the soft\n\n\f14\n\nG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\nX-ray (0.2\u22122 keV) emission of Jupiter's aurorae is best modelled by a continuum and the superposition of emission lines,\nwhich are most likely to be produced by energetic ions undergoing charge exchange as they precipitate in the planet's upper\natmosphere. We confirm that the majority of the emission in all\nspectra at both epochs emerges from OVII transitions at 0.57\nkeV (\u223c22 \u00c5). The underlying continuum, which we fit with a\n0.1\u22120.3 keV bremsstrahlung model, may also be the result, at\nleast in part, of line blending, by analogy with the X-ray emission observed from comets (Dennerl et al. 2003, Kharchenko\net al. 2003). Unlike comets, however, the origin of the ions, if\nsolar wind or Jupiter's magnetosphere, or both, is still a matter\nof debate.\nFour other lines are detected in the EPIC spectra, but not\nall in all spectra. The best fit energies (Table 2) point to transitions of: a) SXI\u2212SXII (0.32 keV; see discussion in Sect. 4.5); b)\nOVIII Ly\u03b1 blended with higher orders of OVII (0.69 keV; see\nTable 5 for line energies); c) Higher orders of OVIII, possibly\ncontaminated by some FeXVII emission (0.83 keV; see Table\n5 and discussion of the excess emission at the FeXVII 15.27 \u00c5\nline in Sect. 5); d) MgXI (1.35 keV; Table 5). Apart from the\ndifferent (but still tentative) identification of the 0.32 keV line,\nthe others are consistent with the interpretations given by BR1.\nRecently, Kharchenko et al. (2006) have modelled the Xray spectrum produced by energetic sulphur and oxygen ions\nprecipitating into the Jovian atmosphere and compared it to\nthose observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton, finding satisfactory agreement. We recall here that both the studies by\nCravens et al. (2003) and Bunce et al. (2004) are able to explain Jupiter's X-ray auroral emission by ions either from the\nplanet's magnetosphere or the solar wind, given appropriate\nacceleration is in place. A pure solar wind scenario, however,\nmay be excluded by the excessive intensity of Ly\u03b1 emission expected by protons also undergoing acceleration and precipitating in the atmosphere (Cravens et al. 2003). While our present\nresults still cannot resolve the dicothomy, we conclude that,\nalso by analogy with the Earth, both magnetospheric and solar\nwind ions may well play a part in the process. In the case of\nthe Earth it has not yet been possible to show conclusively that\nion precipitation (whether of magnetospheric or solar wind origin) produces X-rays in the aurorae. However, recent work by\nBhardwaj et al. (2006c), who have used the Chandra HRC-I to\nmake the first soft X-ray observations of the Earth's aurorae,\nhas provided evidence for electron bremsstrahlung emission at\nenergies below 2 keV.\nThe MgXI line at 1.35 keV is detected in Apr. 2003 and\nonly in rev. 0727 in Nov. 2003. The line is likely to be residual contamination by the disk emission, which may become\nmore evident above \u223c1 keV where the ion contribution to the\nauroral emission is decreasing rapidly. We know that the disk\nacts as a mirror for solar X-rays (Maurellis et al. 2000, Cravens\net al. 2006): Bhardwaj et al. (2005) have shown that a very\nlarge solar flare took place at a time such that Jupiter's response\nto it would have been observable by XMM-Newton had it not\nbeen switched off during perigee passage between revs 0726\nand 0727. Possibly part of this response to the flare, Jupiter's\ndisk emission is seen to be overall brighter by \u223c40%, and the\nflux of the MgXI line from the disk to be three times larger, in\n\nrev. 0727 than in rev. 0726 (Branduardi-Raymont et al. 2006).\nThe enhancement in the FeXVII 15.27 \u00c5 mentioned in Sect. 5\ntakes place at the same time as this brightening of the disk.\n\n6.2. High energy electron component\nA major, novel result of our analysis of Jupiter's EPIC spectra\nis the discovery of a high energy continuum component which\ndominates the emission above \u223c2 keV. The flux in this component, for both aurorae, is practically the same in Apr. and Nov.\n2003, rev. 0727, while it is much higher (by more than a factor\nof 2 at \u223c4 keV in the North aurora; Fig. 8) in rev. 0726. Thus the\ntrend of the variability at energies above 2 keV is exactly opposite to that of the disk emission, which increases between the\ntwo revolutions. The spectral shape of the high energy component is best approximated by a thermal bremsstrahlung model\nwhen the flux is low, and by a very flat power law when it is\nbrighter. A bremsstrahlung emission mechanism is expected to\ninvolve electrons, precipitating over the poles in Jupiter's upper\natmosphere and also likely to be responsible for the main 'UV\nauroral oval', which lies at lower latitudes (or L values) than\nthe polar cap emission. This scenario is supported by another\nXMM-Newton result. We have already pointed out how the high\nenergy component in the South aurora appears to be substantially brighter than in the North relative to the soft part of the\nspectrum (Fig. 5 and Table 4). We suggest that this reversal of\nbrightness could be due to the larger offset of the North magnetic pole from Jupiter's rotation axis (Gladstone et al. 2002),\nwhich provides better sampling of the soft X-ray ion emission\nover the rotation period than at the South pole. Alternatively, or\nin conjunction with this, the South auroral oval is always much\ncloser to the limb than the large, offset North auroral oval is, so\nfrom Earth we have a better chance of seeing emissions at 90o\nto the electron deceleration direction. For this same reason the\nemissions seem to move out towards the limb at higher energy\n(Fig. 5): when the auroral regions are on the disk, the precipitating electrons are moving away from us, making it hard to see\nthe bremsstrahlung emission they are producing. At or beyond\nthe limb, the electrons are moving at more or less 90o to us, i.e.\nin the direction at which the bremsstrahlung emission is at its\npeak.\nThe significant change in spectral slope between the two\nXMM-Newton revolutions (over a timescale of a couple of\ndays) implies a severe hardening in the electron energy distribution with increasing flux: our spectral fits indicate characteristic electron energies of tens of keV, which, interestingly,\nare consistent with those implied for the precipitating electrons producing the cusp/polar cup FUV emissions on Jupiter\n(Bhardwaj and Gladstone 2000). The change from a thermal to\na non-thermal X-ray spectrum also suggests a substantial event\nhas taken place to modify the basic character of the electron\ndistribution.\nBremsstrahlung X-ray emission from primary electrons\nwith a Maxwellian energy distribution, producing secondaries\nby ionisation in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, has been predicted\nat very similar flux levels and very similar characteristic energies to those we observe in rev. 0727 (Waite 1991, Singhal et\n\n\fG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\n15\n\nal. 1992 and Fig. 12). Thus our XMM-Newton observations of\nJupiter have finally revealed what researchers have been speculating upon for more than a decade. The dramatic change in\nslope of the X-ray continuum above 2 keV between revs 0726\nand 0727 suggests that the primary electron energy distribution may be the one mostly implicated in the variability. We\nnote that at the same time a change occurs in the shape of the\nlow energy spectra, attributed to ion emission (including the\nappearence of a line at \u223c0.3 keV; Figs 8 and 9 and Table 2), so\none can speculate that whatever affects the electrons may affect the ions too. Variability of this kind may follow a change\nin the plasma acceleration mechanism within Jupiter's magnetosphere: large electric potentials are needed to accelerate\nthe electrons and to explain the presence of the high energy\nstripped ions required for the charge exchange production of\nthe auroral soft X-ray emission. This scenario has been studied\nin detail by Bunce et al. (2004) in the context of their model\nof pulsed magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause\nbetween magnetospheric and magnetosheath field lines: they\npredict average potentials of \u223c100 kV and 5 MV for electrons\nand ions respectively in their solar wind 'fast flow' case, appropriate to high density, high field solar wind conditions. The\nvery different levels of potential required to accelerate the two\nparticle populations could explain why in rev. 0726 the electron\nvariability is much more marked than that of the ions.\n\nMoreover, broad components of the OVII and OVIII lines are\nrevealed for the first time. Their widths imply speeds of the\norder of \u00b15000 km s\u22121 , which correspond to energies of \u223c2.5\nMeV for oxygen ions. This is not far off the level of energies required by the models of Cravens et al. (1995, 2003; 1 MeV/amu\nfor magnetospheric ions, or 100 keV/amu for solar wind ions)\nand those implied by the potentials calculated by Bunce et al.\n(2004), suggesting that we are indeed seeing a population of accelerated ions precipitating from Jupiter's outer magnetosphere\nto the polar caps. Since the observed oxygen line widths correspond to velocities along the line of sight, the total ion energies\nmay accommodate a magnetospheric as well as a solar wind\norigin.\nDespite the large errors on their fluxes (Table 5), it is\nclear, also from inspection of Figs 15 and 17, that the auroral\nOVII resonance and forbidden lines have similar strengths; this\nmay seem at variance with expectations, considering Jupiter's\nH2 atmospheric density in the auroral regions: collisional deexcitation would most likely occur before the OVII ions had\ntime to decay through the forbidden transition. However, as\nshown by Kharchenko and Dalgarno (2000), some of the\nbrightest lines to emerge following charge transfer collisions\nare indeed from forbidden transitions of helium-like oxygen\nions, which is consistent with our findings.\n\nA period of a couple of months of very strong solar activity\nbegan at the end of October 2003, with a rare 'Sun quake' event\n(Donea and Lindsey 2005), typical of the decaying phases of\nthe solar cycle. Compression of Jupiter's magnetosphere by energetic solar events is expected to result in the generation of potentials and currents leading to stronger acceleration of the ion\nand electron plasma inside it, which in turn can energise more\npowerful auroral emissions. Interestingly, about eight days before the XMM-Newton rev. 0726 observation took place, a large\nenhancement in solar wind electron, proton and ion fluxes was\nrecorded by ACE, which orbits in the vicinity of the Sun-Earth\nL1 point (e.g. Skoug et al. 2004). The solar ejecta causing this\nevent are expected to have reached Jupiter around the time of\nour observation, if they were travelling at 1000 km s\u22121 (this is\na highly uncertain calculation, though, depending on the relative geometry of Jupiter and Earth, on the ejecta propagation\ndirection and on the variable speed of the solar wind). In conclusion, the auroral phenomena may ultimately be solar-driven\nat some level, even if the emitting ions/electrons are not directly injected by the solar wind, and if we do not find strict\ncorrelations with solar behaviour. For example, solar activity\nimmediately preceding the XMM-Newton observations in Apr.\n2003 was at a lower level than in Nov. 2003. Nevertheless, a\nhigh energy auroral component was present in the spectra, and\nwith a larger flux than in Nov. 2003 rev. 0727.\n\n7. Conclusions\n\n6.3. RGS results\nThe RGS spectrum enables us to resolve some of the blend of\nlines observed in Jupiter's EPIC data into the dominant auroral\nemission contributions of OVII and OVIII ions, and those of\nFeXVII (15.0 and \u223c17.0 \u00c5) originating from the planet's disk.\n\nWe have presented the analysis of Jupiter's auroral X-ray emissions as observed over two XMM-Newton revolutions in Nov.\n2003 and we have compared the results with those from an earlier observation in Apr. 2003 (BR1). The majority of the earlier results are confirmed, and in particular that ion charge exchange is likely to be responsible for the soft X-ray emission,\nwith OVII providing the dominant contribution.\nA major outcome of the present work is the discovery of\na high energy X-ray bremsstrahlung component in the aurorae, a component which had been predicted but had never been\ndetected for the lack of sensitivity of previous X-ray missions.\nThe bremsstrahlung interpretation is supported by both spectral\nand morphological considerations. Moreover, we find that this\ncomponent varied significantly in strength and spectral shape\nover the course of the Nov. 2003 observation. We suggest that\nthe variability may be linked to the strong solar activity taking\nplace at the time, and may be induced by changes in the potentials, and thus the acceleration mechanism, inside Jupiter's\nmagnetosphere. This could, to a lower degree, affect the ions\ntoo. As far as the question of the origin of the ions, we still\ncannot resolve the species responsible, if sulphur (likely to be\nof magnetospheric origin), or carbon (from the solar wind). It is\nconceivable that both scenarios play a role in what is certainly\na very complex planetary structure.\nThe XMM-Newton RGS data add a new dimension to this\nstudy in that they allow us to examine the X-ray spectrum of\nthe whole planet at high resolution for the first time. We clearly\nseparate iron emission lines originating at low latitude on the\ndisk of Jupiter from the bright oxygen lines most likely produced by charge exchange in the aurorae. The latter are found\nto be broad, implying that the ions are travelling with speeds\n\n\f16\n\nG. Branduardi-Raymont et al.: A study of Jupiter's aurorae with XMM-Newton\n\n(of the order of 5000 km s\u22121 ) consistent with the levels of acceleration predicted by models recently developed to account\nfor Jupiter's auroral processes.\nThe data presented in this paper give an important contribution to the understanding of the physical environment where\nauroral emissions on Jupiter are generated: they show a good\ndegree of consistency with theoretical models developed in recent years, and thus give us confidence that we broadly understand the basic processes powering Jupiter's aurorae. Yet,\nthe details are far from clear, such as those of the complex relationships between ion and electron populations in Jupiter's\nmagnetospheric environment, and the way these react to external influences such as solar activity. Given the limitations of\ncurrent X-ray observations carried out remotely, in-situ measurements, also in the X-ray band, from future planetary missions will offer a very promising way forward.\nAcknowledgements.
