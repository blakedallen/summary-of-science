Galaxies: Galaxies: clusters: individual: Virgo; Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: fundamental parameters\n\n1. Introduction\nThe faint-end slope of the halo mass function either predicted\nanalytically (Press & Schechter 1974) (\u03b1 = \u22121.8) or by numerical CDM simulations (e.g. Jenkins et al. 2001)(\u03b1 = \u22122)\nis uncomfortably steeper than the observed slope of the optical luminosity function of galaxies (e.g. Blanton et al. 2003)\n(\u03b1 = \u22121.1) (see however \u03b1 = \u22121.5 in r band by Blanton et\nal. 2005). If many sterile halos (i.e. unable to give birth to stars),\nthe so called dark galaxies, or many low mass galaxies with low\noptical surface brightness, yet retaining some neutral hydrogen\nexisted, outnumbering the normal galaxies, the faint-end slope of\nthe HI mass function would be steeper than that of the optical luminosity function, perhaps reconciling the observations with the\ntheoretical predictions. However the measured faint-end slope\nof the HI mass function, even in its most robust determination\n(Springob et al. 2005,) is significantly flatter (\u03b1 = \u22121.24) than\nthe theoretical one (see also Zwaan, Briggs & Sprayberry, 2001).\nThe Zwaan et al. (2005) HI mass function, based on HIPASS\n(HI Parkes All-Sky Survey) data (Meyer et al. 2004), is flatter\n(\u03b1 = \u22121.37) than predicted, although it suffers from statistical\nlimitations due to the paucity of objects (40) with MHI \u2264 108 M\u2299\nand from distance uncertainties (Masters et al. 2004). To improve the determination of the HI mass function, several blind\nHI surveys have been recently carried out or are under way.\nHIDEEP (Minchin et al. 2003) is a deep HI survey of 32 deg2 in\n\nCentaurus, carried out with the Parkes multibeam system, sensitive to MHI \u2265 108 M\u2299 , with deep optical follow-up plates. A\nmore recent one that combines a large area with a high sensitivity is the 86 deg2 survey in the direction of Canes Venatici\n(Cvn) carried out with the WSRT (Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope) by Kovac (2007). Incidentally the slope of the faintend mass function derived using 70 sources with MHI \u2265 106.5 M\u2299\nfrom this survey is flatter than ever (\u03b1 = \u22121.17).\nThe Arecibo telescope, equipped with the new 7 beam system\nALFA, has recently started a number of HI blind surveys. The\nArecibo Galaxy Environment survey (AGES) (Auld et al. 2006)\nhas covered some patches of sky, including 5 deg2 of the Coma\nsupercluster containing the cluster A1367, with a sensitivity of\nMHI = 108.8 M\u2299 at the distance of Coma (300 s integration time\nper beam, rms=0.84 mJy/beam; Cortese et al. 2007). Highly statistically significant results will be obtained from ALFALFA, the\nArecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey, that covers the Arecibo sky\n(7000 deg2 ) in a 2-pass drift-scan mode (48 s integration, with a\ntypical rms=2.1 mJy/beam at 10 km/s resolution; Giovanelli et\nal. 2005). Besides a robust determination of the faint-end slope\nof the HI mass function, (based on several hundred galaxies\nwith MHI \u2264 107.5 M\u2299 ) ALFALFA will provide more evidence\non whether low surface brightness galaxies, that are so elusive\noptically (Disney 1976; Disney & Phillipps 1987; Sabatini et\nal. 2003), will change our understanding of galaxies in the local universe. This issue has two aspects that could be addressed\n\n\f2\n\nG. Gavazzi et al.: Properties of HI selected galaxies in the Virgo cluster\n\nand solved with ALFALFA. One is to increase the number of\ndwarf galaxies surveyed to better determine the number density\nof low surface brightness galaxies that, in spite of their low optical visibility, are HI rich. (Galaxies of decreasing mass have\nan increasing gas fraction and a decreasing optical (i-band) surface brightness (Boselli et al. 2001; Warren et al. 2006)). The\nother is to confirm and corroborate the finding of Briggs (1997),\nRosenberg et al (2002), Zwaan et al (2003), Minchin et al. (2004)\nthat the frequency of Malin1-type galaxies, i.e. massive, gas rich\nobjects of very low optical surface brightness, is insignificant\n(see also Hayward, Irwin & Bregman 2005). Malin1 was indeed\ndiscovered in HI in the background of the Virgo cluster (Impey\n& Bothun 1989). How many unknown low surface brightness\ngalaxies remain hidden in the local universe, unseen by optical\nobservations? ALFALFA should provide the complete census of\nsuch objects.\nIn the last two years ALFALFA has covered most of the Virgo\ncluster (Giovanelli et al. 2006), the nearest rich cluster, providing \u223c 1000 HI sources in 80 deg2 , perhaps the highest space\ndensity of HI sources in the whole ALFALFA survey. The analysis of this sample will dramatically enhance our understanding\nof the issues outlined above. The Virgo region is especially useful because of the existence of a very deep optical catalogue of\ngalaxies, the Virgo Cluster Catalogue (VCC) by Binggeli et al.\n(1985), that will allow a comparison of the properties of optically and radio selected objects in this region. The overlap between the ALFALFA survey and Goldmine, a collection of HI\npointed observations in the direction of Virgo obtained by many\nobservers during the years (Gavazzi et al. 2005), also allows a\ncomparison of the relative quality of the two databases. These\nare the issues that the present paper on the Virgo cluster, as seen\nby ALFALFA, wishes to address. A forthcoming paper will analyze H\u03b1 observations obtained recently of several hundred HI\ngalaxies discovered by ALFALFA in the Virgo cluster and in its\nimmediate surroundings (Gavazzi et al. in preparation), addressing the issue of the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution (see a review by Boselli & Gavazzi 2006) by comparing the\nrate of transformation of primordial gas into young stars in the\nVirgo cluster with that in less dense environments.\nThe structure of the present paper is as follows. The HI and optical selected samples are presented in Section 2. The data analysis\nis presented in Section 3, where the reduction of optical images\ntaken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is discussed\nin detail. Section 4 gives the comparison between the results of\nALFALFA and pointed observations available in the literature.\nThe results are discussed in Section 5.\n\n2. The sample\nThe present analysis is focused on the ALFALFA blind HI survey in the region of the Virgo cluster; more precisely in the area\nof intersection between ALFALFA, as available in Sept 2007,\nand the VCC. The ALFALFA survey provides a sample of HI\nselected objects, and the VCC a list of optically selected galaxies.\n\nstrip that has been fully mapped by ALFALFA. North of 12 deg\nthe catalogued sources are taken from Giovanelli et al. (2007);\nfor 08o \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 12o the list of sources is not yet published (Kent\net al. in preparation);\nii) they have recessional velocities in the range \u22121000 < cz <\n3000 km s\u22121 , bracketing the full depth of the Virgo cluster (see\nGavazzi et al. 1999);\niii) they have quality Code = 1, i.e., their statistical significance\nis higher than S/N=6.5. (We do not consider Code = 2 objects,\ni.e., sources with S/N < 6.5 that have optical counterparts with\noptical redshifts matching the HI line redshift.)\niv) they are not included in the circle of projected radius of 1.0\ndeg centered on M87, where ALFALFA is strongly incomplete\nbecause of loss of spectral sensitivity due to the bright (220 Jy\nat 1415 MHz) continuum source associated with M87;\nv) they lie outside one resolution element (3.5 arcmin) of any\nother strong source at similar redshift. The six excluded sources\nbecause of this criterion are:\n122140.1 +143621 = VCC0497 conf by VCC0483\n122140.1 +143621 = VCC1673 conf by VCC1676\n124331.5 +113500 = VCC1972 conf by VCC1978\nSince the mean rms of ALFALFA is 2.1 mJy/beam, the survey detection limit (for S/N=6.5) is 0.5 Jy/beam km s\u22121 for typical widths of 40 km s\u22121 , thus, at the mean distance of the Virgo\ncluster (17 Mpc), using the relation:\nMHI = S /N \u00d7 rms \u00d7 W \u00d7 dist2 \u00d7 2.36 \u00d7 105 (M\u2299 )\n\n(1)\n\nthese sources have MHI \u2265 107.5 M\u2299 . The MHI limit, however\ndepends on the line width, thus on the system's mass and inclination, as detailed in Section 5.1, resulting in 107.5 M\u2299 \u2264\nMHI limit \u2264 108 M\u2299 .\n2.2. The optically selected sample\n\nFrom the VCC catalogue (Goldmine version, Gavazzi et al.\n2003), restricted to the region in common with ALFALFA we\nhave extracted two subsamples of optically selected galaxies\nthat are bona-fide Virgo cluster members, whose distances have\nbeen assigned following the subcluster membership criteria of\nGavazzi et al. (1999), updated with new redshift measurements.\nThe VCC catalogue contains galaxies as faint as 20 mag, but is\ncomplete to mB < 18 mag, within a limiting surface brightness\nof 25.3 B mag arcsec\u22122 (Binggeli et al. 1985). From this catalogue we have considered:\nSample A (deep) consisting of 1112 galaxies with mB < 20 mag;\nSample B (shallow) consisting of 469 galaxies with mB \u2264 17\nmag1 , 278 of which are early-type (dE-E-S0-S0a)2 and 191 are\nlate-type (Sa-Irr-BCD) galaxies. The number of galaxies with\nredshifts is 410/469, including 226/278 early-types and 184/191\nlate-types. At the mean distance of the Virgo cluster (17 Mpc, or\nM \u2212 m = \u221231.1 mag) mB \u2264 17 mag corresponds to MB \u2264 \u221214.1\nmag, thus even Sample B includes dwarf systems.\n\n2.1. The HI selected sample\n\nThe HI selected sample consists of 187 ALFALFA sources\nmeeting the following criteria:\ni) their right ascensions lie in the interval 12h 08m 30 s \u2264 R.A. \u2264\n12h 48m 20 s (ca. 182o \u2264 R.A. \u2264 192o ) (J2000) corresponding\nto the extent in R.A. of the VCC, and their declinations range\nbetween 08o \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 16o (J2000), i.e., they lie in the declination\n\n1\nWe have preferred not to extend the shallow sample B to mB = 18\nmag because in the bin 17 \u2264 mB \u2264 18 mag only 6% of the VCC galaxies\nhave an HI counterpart in ALFALFA, while in the bin 16 \u2264 mB \u2264 17\nmag 40% are in ALFALFA.\n2\nNotice that the morphological class \"dE\" might be contaminated by\nsome transition objects (dE/dIrr) but we find at most 8 gas-rich ones, as\nshown in Section. 3.4.\n\n\fG. Gavazzi et al.: Properties of HI selected galaxies in the Virgo cluster\n\n3\n\n3. The data reduction\n3.1. HI (ALFALFA)\n\nFor each of the HI selected sources we consider the following\nHI parameters taken from ALFALFA (Giovanelli et al. 2007):\n- the (J2000) coordinates (affected by an error that depends on\nS/N, with a mean of \u2248 24 arcsec);\n- the recessional velocity VP;\n- the observed width of the HI line W. This is the width of the\nprofile measured at the 50% level of each of the two peaks,\ncorrected for instrumental broadening;\n- the total flux under the HI line: S intP (Jy km s\u22121 );\nFor sources optically identified with VCC galaxies,\nwe convert S intP into the HI mass using: MHI\n=\n2.36 \u00d7 105 \u00d7 S intP \u00d7 (dist)2 (M\u2299 ), where the distance is\ndetermined as in Gavazzi et al. (1999), otherwise using 17\nMpc, and we correct the observed line width W for projection\neffects, using the ratio of the optical minor-to-major axes:\nWc = W/sin(acos(b/a)).\nWe also estimate the HI deficiency parameter following Haynes\n& Giovanelli (1984) as the logarithmic difference between MHI\nof a reference sample of isolated galaxies and MHI actually observed in individual objects: De fHI = LogMHI re f. \u2212LogMHI obs. .\nLogMHI re f has been found to be linearly related to the galaxies\nlinear diameter d as: LogMHI re f = a + bLog(d), where d (in\nkpc) is determined at the 25th B-band isophote, and a and b are\nweak functions of the Hubble type. We caution that the Haynes\n& Giovanelli (1984) reference sample of isolated galaxies\nincluded only relatively large (a > 1 arcmin) UGC objects so\nthat the De fHI parameter is poorly calibrated for smaller objects,\nmaking determinations of the HI deficiency for the smallest\nobjects uncertain and likely underestimated (Solanes 1996).\nFurthermore, as discussed in Solanes et al. (2001) galaxies in the\nlatest Hubble types (Scd-Im-BCD), for which we have adopted\na and b parameters consistent with those of Sc, are more subject\nto observational biases than higher surface brightness galaxies.\nThe reader should be aware that the determinations of the HI\ndeficiency for these objects is highly uncertain.\nFor all radio sources we compute the total flux divided by the\nline width: \u03a3HIc = S intP/W in Jy/beam; this parameter is an\nindicator of the \"visibility\" in the ALFALFA survey (see Fig.8).\n\n3.2. Optical & HI (Goldmine)\n\nFor each of the VCC galaxies we take from the Goldmine\ndatabase:\n- the (J2000) optical coordinates (accurate to \u2248 30 arcsec);\n- the morphological type (adopted from Binggeli et al. 1985 and\nfrom Binggeli et al. 1993);\n- the major (a) and minor (b) axes (arcmin) (from Binggeli et\nal. 1985). These quantities are used to correct the observed line\nwidths according to the galaxy inclination;\n- the distance (in Mpc) (computed according to the criteria of\nGavazzi et al. 1999). The adopted distances for each subgroup\nof Virgo are: 17 \u00b1 0.3 Mpc for cluster A, the North and East\nclouds and the Southern extension, 23 \u00b1 0.5 Mpc for cluster B\nand 32 \u00b1 0.9 Mpc for the W and M clouds.\nIn order to compare the new HI parameters derived by\nALFALFA with the plethora of earlier pointed observations, collected and made as homogeneous as possible by Gavazzi et al.\n(2005)for the Goldmine HI database, we also consider:\n- the measured width of the HI line. The Goldmine measurement\n\nFig. 1. The distribution in celestial coordinates of sources in the\nVirgo cluster.

It should\nbe noted that the 21 cm data in Goldmine were obtained from a\nvariety of observations taken at Arecibo, some of which lasted\nmuch longer (typically one hour) than the ALFALFA observations (\u223c 48 sec in the beam), thus reaching a sensitivity about\none order of magnitude better than ALFALFA. These measurements are however limited to late-type galaxies.\n3.3. SDSS imaging material and reduction\n\nFor the optical comparisons, we obtained g and i band images\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR 5) (Adelman et al. 2007)\nthat cover the 187 HI selected sources and the optically selected\nlate-type galaxies with mB \u2264 17 (Sample B). Only one galaxy\n(VCC1401) was not available the SDSS. Two or more (up to 4)\nSDSS fields were combined for 13 galaxies (VCC66, 89, 167,\n596, 865, 873, 939, 1588, 1727, 1778, 1932, 2058 and 2070)\nthat were present in two or more SDSS images. All frames were\nphotometrically calibrated using the wavelength dependent parameters contained in the calibration tables associated with the\nindividual SDSS images, namely the zero point (aa), the extinction coefficient (kk) and the airmass. The effective zero point (in\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of the ALFALFA (blind) and Goldmine\n(pointed) 21-cm line intensity measurements of Virgo galaxies.\nThe line represents the one to one relation.\nAB magnitudes) was derived using: ZPe f f = aa + kk \u2217 airmass.\n(See the SDSS data release 6 for further details on the flux calibration.)\nThe SDSS image analysis was carried out in the IRAF environment and relied on the STSDAS package 3 and on GALPHOT\n(developed for IRAF- STSDAS mainly by W. Freudling, J.\nSalzer, and M.P. Haynes and adapted by S.Zibetti and L. Cortese.\nSee Gavazzi et al. 2001).\nFor each frame the sky background was determined as the mean\nnumber of counts measured in regions of \"empty\" sky, and it\nwas subtracted from the frame. Sky-subtracted frames were inspected individually and the light from superposed or nearby\nstars and galaxies was masked.\nThe 2-dimensional light distribution of each galaxy was fit with\nelliptical isophotes, using the task cphot, a modified version of\nthe STSDAS isophote package. Starting from a set of initial parameters given manually, the fit maintains as free parameters the\nellipse center, ellipticity and position angle. The ellipse semimajor axis is incremented by a fixed fraction of its value at each\nstep of the fitting procedure.

Gavazzi et al.: Properties of HI selected galaxies in the Virgo cluster\n\nbrightness found in a given annulus equals the sky rms. The fit\nfails to converge for 46 galaxies with very irregular light distributions or low surface brightness. In these cases we kept fixed\none or more of the initial parameters. In 14 instances of exceedingly low brightness no reliable fit was obtained (for ten HI selected objects and for four optically selected galaxies, namely:\nVCC 585, 1121, 1582, 1884).\nThe resulting radial light profiles were fitted with models of the\ngalaxy light distribution. The majority, 72%, were best fit with an\nexponential disk law, while 27% were best fit by a combination\nof a disk and a bulge r1/4 law and 1% by a pure de Vaucouleurs\nlaw (de Vaucouleurs 1948).\nTotal magnitudes g, i were then obtained by adding to the flux\nmeasured within the outermost significant isophote the flux extrapolated to infinity along either the exponential law that fitted\nthe outer parts of most galaxies (pure disks and B+D galaxies),\nor the r1/4 law (dV galaxies). The mean statistical uncertainty\nin the determination of the total magnitude is 0.10 mag. The effective radius re (the radius containing half of the total light, in\narcsec) and the effective surface brightness \u03bce (the mean surface brightness within re in mag arcsec\u22122 ) of each galaxy are\ncomputed only for the i band. The mean statistical uncertainties of the determination of re and \u03bce are 2 arcsec and 0.15\nmag arcsec\u22122 , respectively. The statistical uncertanties refer to\nthe errors obtained from fitting models to the observed galaxy\nlight distributions; we note that they do not correlate with magnitude or surface brightness, but rather with the presence of complex structures (e.g. bars or irregularities in the light profiles).\nBesides the statistical uncertainties, however, the photometric\nparameters of faint galaxies are affected by additional uncertainties that might depend on local fluctuations of the sky brightness.\nIn the following analysis all fits are performed with the maximum likelihood method using statistical uncertainties.\nFinally we computed another structural parameter: the concentration index (C31 ), defined by de Vaucouleurs (1977) as the\nmodel\u2013independent ratio between the radii that enclose 75% and\n25% of the total i light.\nWe converted the total i-band magnitude to the stellar mass using:\nlog(M star /M\u2299 ) = \u22120.152+0.518\u2217(g\u2212i)+logI (see Appendix A2\nin Bell et al. 2003), where I is the i-band luminosity. The typical\nuncertainty of log(M star /I) is \u223c 0.1 dex.\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.

Fig. 1, bottom panel, provides the locations of\nthese objects. Only 4 matches are found with the 278 early-type\ngalaxies of Sample B: VCC93, 209, 304 and 355. Among the\nlate-types galaxies, 139/191 (73%) match an HI source. Thus\nonly 52/191 (27%) late-type VCC galaxies in Sample B do not\nmatch HI selected sources. Of these, 37 lie below the sensitivity\nthreshold of ALFALFA, based on Goldmine; the remaining 15\nare not considered by us in spite of being detected, because they\nhave Code\u22652.\nIn any case most of these low MHI galaxies (32/37 or 46/52\nincluding the code\u22652) are relatively bright and HI deficient\n(De fHI > 0.6).\n\n3.4. The radio-optical identifications\n\nWe cross-correlated the 187 HI selected sources with the optically selected sample A (deep) to obtain the optical identifications of all HI sources matching a simple positional criterion\n(separation<1 arcmin). Fig. 1, top panel, provides the locations\nof these objects. We find 156/187 (83%) identifications with\nVCC galaxies (including 8 sources associated with early type\ngalaxies - these coincide with the Code 1 sources found by di\nSerego Alighieri et al. 2007). Ten of the remaining 31 sources\nare not associated with optical galaxies and were found to correspond to tidally-disrupted systems by Kent et al. (2007) and by\nHaynes, Giovanelli and Kent (2007). Among the other 21 (11%\nof the total sample), 15 are associated with faint galaxies that\nare surprisingly not listed in the VCC in spite of being clearly\ndetected and measurable on the SDSS material. Only 6 are not\nvisible in the SDSS images; we consider their effective surface\nbrightness fainter than 25 mag arcsec\u22122 .\nWe then cross-correlated the 469 galaxies in the optically selected VCC sample B (shallow) with the ALFALFA positions,\nseparately for the 191 late-type galaxies and for the 278 early-\n\n4. Analysis\n4.1. Consistency with previous pointed HI measurements\n\nThe comparison of the line widths determined by ALFALFA\nand by the pointed observations collected in the Goldmine\ndatabase is shown in Fig. 2. There is a tendency ALFALFA HI\nline widths to be up to 50% smaller than those of Goldmine for\ngalaxies with W < 100 km s\u22121 . The difference decreases for\nincreasing line widths. This discrepancy reflects the difference\nof the two methods used to measure the line widths in the two\ndatasets (i.e. average of 20% and 50% of the peak intensity in\nGoldmine vs. 50% level of each of the two peaks in ALFALFA).\nThe line measurements taken homogeneously by ALFALFA\nshould provide a reliable determination of the distances to\nindividual galaxies using the Tully-Fisher relation (see next\nSection).\nFig. 3 shows the comparison of the HI mass measurements.\nThere is no apparent trend with MHI .\n\n\f6\n\nG. Gavazzi et al.: Properties of HI selected galaxies in the Virgo cluster\n\nFig. 5. HI/optical luminosity correlation plotted separately for\nnon-deficient (filled dots) and for objects with De fHI \u2265 0.6\n(open symbols). The dashed line gives the (line width dependent) limit of ALFALFA computed for an inclination of 45 deg.\nThe diagonal dotted lines represent the maximum likelihood regressions fitted to the data, independently for HI deficient and\nnormal galaxies.\n4.2. The Tully-Fisher relation\n\nUsing the corrected line width Wc as measured by ALFALFA\nand the i-band luminosity derived from the total iAB magnitude,\nand restricting to objects with inclination larger than 35 deg, we\nobtain the i-band Tully-Fisher relation for galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster (see Fig. 4). For this specific purpose it was necessary\nto consider a subsample of non-deficient galaxies, i.e. galaxies\nwith the HI deficiency parameter De fHI < 0.6. This is because\nin the ram-pressure scenario (e.g. Abadi et al. 1999) HI ablation\nproceeds outside-in, depleting first the gas that is less gravitationally bound, so that the full width of the measured line profile underestimates the rotational velocity. After allowing for a\n0.50 mag shift for converting iAB (SDSS) into I J (Johnson) magnitudes (according to the conversion table in NED), we apply\nthe internal extinction corrections as in Giovanelli et al. (1997).\nFor log(Wc ) > 2 and excluding the Irr/BCD galaxies, the obtained relation appears consistent in slope and zero point with\nthe template I J Tully-Fisher determined by Masters et al. (2006).\nThis indicates that the distances of the individual Virgo galaxies\nadopted in this work are not badly determined. For log(Wc ) \u2264 2\nand for Irr/BCD the dispersion of the relation makes it useless as\na distance indicator.\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. The HI to stellar mass relation\n\nA basic feature of galaxies is the fact that the HI mass increase\nwith increasing optical luminosity is flatter than the direct proportionality (Roberts & Haynes 1994). Fig. 5 shows the relation between these two quantities (given for all optically iden-\n\nFig. 6. Gas to star mass ratio separately for non-deficient (filled\ndots) and for objects with De fHI \u2265 0.6 (open symbols). The\ndashed line represents the limit of the HI survey computed for\nan inclination of 45 deg.\n\ntified HI selected sources). Because the present analysis is carried out with galaxies belonging to a rich cluster, the study of\nthe dependence of HI mass on luminosity must be corrected\nfor the effects of ram-pressure stripping (that causes HI deficiency: Giovanelli & Haynes 1985) by excluding HI deficient\nobjects (De fHI \u2265 0.6). This is why galaxies with \"normal\" HI\ncontent are plotted separately from the HI-deficient objects in\nFig. 5. (We remind the reader that the definition of HI deficiency adopted here is a diameter-, not an optical-luminositybased relation). The line fitted to the non-deficient objects (using the \"maximum likelihood\" method) shows that the slope of\nthe relation with the optical (i-band) luminosity is < 1, with\nlog(MHI /M\u2299 ) = (0.563 \u00b1 0.002) \u00d7 log(I lum) + (3.68 \u00b1 0.02).\nAfter transforming the optical luminosity into the stellar mass\n(using the relation given in Sect. 3.3) the meaning of the above\nfinding is emphasized by plotting in Fig. 6 the ratio of the HI\nto stellar mass versus the stellar mass itself. By focusing only\non the non-deficient objects it is apparent that the most massive galaxies, the giant spirals with stellar masses in excess of\n1010 M\u2299 , have approximately 5% of their stellar mass in gas,\nintermediate mass galaxies have 10% gaseous mass, but in the\ndwarfs the gas content can exceed the mass of the stars by a factor up to 10. Molecular hydrogen is not expected to change this\ntrend. Using a luminosity/metallicity dependent CO to H2 conversion factor, it has been shown that the molecular gas fraction\ndecreases with increasing stellar mass and that the MH2 /MHI\nratio stays approximately around 15% regardless of the morphological type (see Fig. 6 in Boselli et al. 2002). The extrapolation\nof this relation to even lower stellar masses, suggests the existence of completely gas-dominated objects, similar to the so\ncalled \"dark galaxies\". One of the results of ALFALFA is however that, at least in the mass range covered by the survey, there\nare practically no dark galaxies in the Virgo cluster (Kent et al.\n2007; Haynes, Giovanelli & Kent 2007).\n\n\fG. Gavazzi et al.: Properties of HI selected galaxies in the Virgo cluster\n\n7\n\nIn both Fig. 5 and 6 we plot the position of Malin1 (taken from\nPickering et al. 1997) to show that we are sensitive to Malin1\ntype objects, if they existed in the Virgo cluster.\nAs pointed out in Section 2.1, the mass limit of any flux-limited\nHI survey depends on the line width, thus on the system's mass.\nUsing the virial theorem, assuming a constant mass/light ratio\nof 4.6 (Gavazzi et al. 1996) and the best fit relation between\nRe and the stellar mass (Fig. 9 and Table 1), we derive a relation between W (the line width) and the stellar mass. Using eq.\n1, we obtain the sensitivity of ALFALFA in HI mass units as\nlog(MHI /M\u2299 ) = 4.25 + 0.37 \u2217 logM star \u2212 0.15 (holding for nondeficient objects), where the last term represents the correction\nfor a galaxy mean inclination of 45\u25e6 . For less inclined galaxies\nthe sensitivity increases, approaching log(MHI /M\u2299 ) = 7.5. The\nrelation is plotted in Figs 5 and 6 representing the limiting HI\nmass of sources in ALFALFA as a function of the stellar mass.\n5.2. The surface brightness to stellar mass relation\n\nOne interesting issue that the ALFALFA observations of the\nVirgo cluster allow us to address, as outlined in the Introduction,\nis the question whether optically selection criteria strongly bias\nour knowledge of galaxies. For example, low-surface brightness objects, particularly giant, low-surface brightness, gas-rich\ngalaxies such as Malin1, are strongly undersampled in optical catalogues, but should be detected in a radio selected sample . To explore this issue we exploit the ALFALFA sample\nin conjunction with the excellent (20 mag limiting magnitude\nand \u223c 25.3 mag arcsec\u22122 limiting surface brightness) VCC catalogue, by comparing the optical structural parameters derived for\nthe optically selected and for the HI selected samples. We first\ncompare in Fig. 7 the scaling law between the optical (i-band)\neffective surface brightness and the stellar mass (for the subsample of the ALFALFA or VCC galaxies that we could measure on\nthe SDSS images, i.e., all but 14 objects). The data include the\nHI-selected sample (filled circles & squares) and the opticallyselected sample of late-type galaxies with mB \u2264 17 (empty circles). The two sets of data appear to be consistent one another.\nThe maximum likelihood fit to the optically selected sample is\nplotted together with the lines at \u00b12\u03c3. The horizontal line drawn\nat \u03bc = 23.9 mag arcsec\u22122 is the i band mean limiting surface\nbrightness of SDSS that we have determined as 1\u03c3 of the sky\nvia analysis of hundreds of images. The few measurements that\nlie below this line are meaningless, since they are affected by \u223c 1\nmag arcsec\u22122 uncertainty. There are at most two galaxies (VCC\n307 and VCC 905, highlighted in Fig. 7) that have slightly low\nsurface brightness for their mass, and four BCD galaxies (i.e.\nVCC 334, VCC 410, VCC 1313 and VCC 1437) at the opposite side of the relation, with high surface brightness for their\nmass. There are no others that mimic Malin1. The prototype of\ngiant low-surface brightness galaxy, Malin1, plotted for comparison, deserves some caution. The galaxy is plotted twice (connected with a line): once at the position given by the discoverers\n(Bothun et al. 1987) with \u03bco (V) = 25.5 mag arcsec\u22122 (that we\ntransform into \u03bco (i) = 25.0 mag arcsec\u22122 ) at 1011 L\u2299, the other\nas measured on the SDSS plates. On this material the low surface brightness extended disk is not detected, instead the galaxy\nappears as an amorphous enhancement of high surface brightness (\u03bce \u223c 20.5 mag arcsec\u22122 ), consistent with the inner disk detected in the HST measurement of Barth (2007). This raises the\nquestion whether other Malin1 type objects are missing in Fig.\n7 because their low-surface brightness disks are below the limiting surface brightness of SDSS. These systems would wrongly\ncount as high surface brightness systems because we would de-\n\nFig. 7.

To make sure that this is not the case we inspected individually all galaxies on the SDSS and deeper plate material\n(Goldmine) and we concluded that all high surface brightness\nobjects plotted in Fig. 7 are genuine high surface brightness spirals and BCDs, not bulges associated with missed extended disks\nof much lower surface brightness. The BCDs cannot be mistaken\nfor Malin1 objects because the associated HI components have\nlow mass and widths not exceeding 100 km s\u22121 , opposite to the\nHI rich and massive Malin1. Even if they were perfectly faceon, their much bluer color would discriminate BCDs from possible bulges of missed Malin1 type objects. We conclude that no\nMalin1-type galaxy is found in the Virgo cluster that we could\nhave missed optically or by HI selection, in agreement with\nMinchin et al. (2004), who put severe upper limits on the existence of massive low surface brightness objects in the local field.\nMoreover we find a definite trend for the i-band surface brightness to correlate with the system mass. Extremely low surface\nbrightness galaxies exist, but they all lie at the low mass limit of\nHI and optical surveys. At the limiting sensitivity of ALFALFA\nat Virgo (MHI \u223c 107.5\u223c8 M\u2299 ) there are at most 10/185 HI sources\nthat could possibly be identified with galaxies of lower surface\nbrightness than the SDSS limit (\u223c 23.9 mag arcsec\u22122 ).\n\n5.3. The distribution of mass and surface brightness\n\nFig. 8 contains histograms of the distribution of surface brightness and luminosity, both HI and optical, as derived for optical\n(red) and HI selected samples (blue). It may be surprising that\n\n\f8\n\nG. Gavazzi et al.: Properties of HI selected galaxies in the Virgo cluster\n\nFig. 8. Histograms of luminosities (top) and surface brightness (bottom) for the HI-selected (left) and optically-selected (right)\nsamples. The distributions refer to the HI-selected sample (blue) and to the optically-selected sample limited to mB \u2264 17 (solid red)\nand to mB \u2264 15 (dotted red). Note that the bins at \u03bce = 25 mag arcsec\u22122 represent upper limits (10 HI selected and 6 optically\nselected objects too faint to be measured in i-band).\nthere appears to be very little difference between the red and the\nblue histograms. There is indeed some excess of low surface\nbrightness objects in the HI selected sample, represented by the\n10 very faint galaxies that could not be measured on the SDSS\nmaterial and are plotted as upper limits in the 25 mag arcsec\u22122\nbin. (Note that the 10 tidally-disrupted systems were not\ncounted among the low-surface brightness objects.) However\nthese sources amount to less than 5 % of the total number.\nSimilarly in the optically-selected sample there are 4 VCC\ngalaxies that could not be measured on the SDSS material.\nThe difference is surprisingly small when we compare the\nHI-selected sample with the mB \u2264 17 optically-selected VCC\nsub-sample. To show that this agreement is not at all obvious we\ncompute the distribution also for a shallower subsample of the\nVCC, limited to mB \u2264 15 (red dotted histogram). This time the\noptical (luminosity and surface brightness) distributions differ\nsignificantly from the HI-selected distributions, owing to the\nexistence of the surface brightness vs. luminosity correlation\nthat was investigated in Section 5.2 (see Fig. 7). Virgo appears\njust at the right distance from us to make a survey with the\nsensitivity of ALFALFA to match almost exactly the VCC\ngalaxies of late-type with mB \u2264 17.\n\n5.4. Other optical structural parameters\n\nInspired by the analysis carried out by Cortese et al. (2007)\nwho studied the relations between various structural parameters\nin their Fig. 6, we derive additional optical (i-band) structural\nparameters for the HI selected objects and for the mB \u2264 17 optically selected late-type VCC sub-sample. These are the galaxy\n\"scale\" (stellar mass, Re , luminosity or combinations) and\n\"form\"(\u03bce, g \u2212 i, C31 ) (following the terminology of Whitmore\n1984). They are plotted in Fig. 9 for sources identified with\ngalaxies selected in the blind ALFALFA HI survey (blue)\nand for the optically selected late-type systems from the VCC\ncatalogue, limited to mB \u2264 17 (red). The maximum likelihood\nregressions fitted to the data are plotted in Fig. 9 and reported in\nTable 1.\nIt is evident from Fig. 9 that the scaling relations well known\nfor optically selected galaxies (e.g. color vs. mass, color vs.\nsurface brightness, C31 vs. mass; Gavazzi et al. 1996, Scodeggio\net al. 2002), including the Kormendy relation (Re vs. \u03bce ), also\nhold true for HI selected objects. We emphasize that this result\napplies to galaxy members of a rich cluster such as Virgo.\nFor example the \u03bce vs. M star relation clearly shows that low\nsurface brightness galaxies exist (and are easy to miss), but\nthey lie mostly at the low end of the luminosity function, as\n\n\fG.

Notice in the color vs. stellar mass and color\nvs. surface brightness panels that the deviant points (faint-red\nobjects) are generally dE that have structural and photometric\nproperties intermediate between quiescent and star forming\ndwarfs (Boselli et al. 2008)\nFurthermore the frequency distributions of the \"scale\" and\n\"form\" parameters are indistinguishable in HI and optically\nselected surveys. For example the frequency of pure disks, that\nhave C31 < 3 exceeds the frequency of bulge+disk systems\n(C31 >> 3) in both the HI- and optically-selected samples.\nBut galaxies with C31 >> 3 galaxies exist in both samples.\nWe conclude that the scaling laws that exist among the optical\n(i-band) structural parameters of disk galaxies do not differ\nsignificantly in HI and optically selected samples, although\nwe should emphasize again that this result is limited to a rich\nnearby cluster.\n\n6. Conclusions\nBy surveying the Virgo cluster, ALFALFA has provided definite\nevidence that: i) HI inhabits galaxies that are structurally similar\nto ordinary late-type galaxies; ii) their HI content can be predicted from their optical luminosity; iii) low surface brightness\ngalaxies have low optical luminosity and contain small quantities\nof neutral hydrogen; iv) Malin1 type galaxies are comfortably\nrare objects (less than 0.5 %); v) there are no \"dark-galaxies\"\nwith HI masses MHI \u2265 107.5\u223c8 M\u2299 (see Kent et al. 2007 and\nHaynes, Giovanelli and Kent 2007); vi) less than 1% of earlytype galaxies contain neutral hydrogen with MHI \u2265 107.5\u223c8 M\u2299\n(di Serego Alighieri et al. 2007).\nOnce ALFALFA covers a substantial fraction of its final area,\nincluding the Virgo cluster in its full extent, a determination of\nthe HI mass function will be obtained with unprecedented significance. We expect that the observed HI mass function of the\ncluster can be predicted with sufficient accuracy from the optical\nluminosity function of the late-type galaxies alone, accounting\nfor the HI vs. optical luminosity relation discussed in Section 5.1\n(Fig. 5), computed separately for normal and HI deficient objects\n(Kent et al. in preparation). If this is the case we expect that the\nfaint-end slope will not differ significantly from that of the optical luminosity function of late-type galaxies, i.e. flatter than the\nhalo mass function predicted theoretically from the CDM cosmology.\nAcknowledgements.
