Dainese, F. Antinori, C. Bombonati, M. Lunardon, and R. Turrisi,\nfor the ALICE Collaboration\n\narXiv:nucl-ex/0510083v1 31 Oct 2005\n\nDipartimento di Fisica \"G. Galilei\", Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, and INFN, Italy\nReceived October 28, 2005\nWe present the expected ALICE performance for the measurement of the pt -differential\ncross section of electrons from beauty decays in central Pb\u2013Pb collisions at the LHC.\nPACS : 25.75.-q, 14.65.Dw, 13.25.Ft\nKey words: heavy-ion collisions, beauty hadrons, semi-leptonic decays\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe ALICE experiment [1] will study proton\u2013proton, proton\u2013nucleus and nucleus\u2013\nnucleus collisions at the LHC, with centre-of-mass energies per nucleon\u2013nucleon\n\u221a\n(NN) pair, sNN , of 5.5 TeV for Pb\u2013Pb, 8.8 TeV for p\u2013Pb, and 14 TeV for pp. The\nprimary physics goal of ALICE is the study of the properties of QCD matter at\nthe energy densities of several hundred times the density of atomic nuclei that will\nbe reached in central Pb\u2013Pb collisions. Under these conditions a deconfined state\nof quarks and gluons is expected to be formed. Heavy quarks, and hard partons in\ngeneral, would probe this medium via the mechanism of QCD energy loss. In particular, measuring the high-pt suppression of beauty hadrons and comparing it to\nthat of light-flavour and charm hadrons, would allow us to investigate the predicted\nquark-mass dependence of parton energy loss [2]. Besides energy loss studies, the\nmeasurement of the beauty cross section provides the normalization for quarkonia\nproduction, needed to address medium effects on quarkonia.\n2\n\nExpected rates and detection strategy\n\nBeauty decays with an electron in the final state have a 'global' branching ratio\nof \u2248 21%: \u2248 11% for direct semi-electronic decays, B \u2192 e\u03bd + X, and \u2248 10% for\nsemi-electronic decays via a charm hadron, B \u2192 D(\u2192 e\u03bd + X) + X \u2032 [3]. The heavyflavour production yields in Pb\u2013Pb collisions, used as a baseline for the ALICE\nperformance studies, are obtained [4] by scaling, according to the number of binary\ncollisions, the results of QCD calculations at next-to-leading order accuracy for pp\ncollisions [5]. The expected yields of beauty hadrons and beauty-decay electrons in a\n\u221a\n0\u20135% central Pb\u2013Pb collision at sNN = 5.5 TeV are about 9.0 and 1.9, respectively,\nof which about 1/4 within the ALICE central barrel acceptance |\u03b7| < 0.9.\nAs in central Pb\u2013Pb collisions at the LHC between 3000 and 10 000 charged\nhadrons may be produced in the region |\u03b7| < 0.9, high-performance electron identification will be necessary. In ALICE, a combined selection on dE/dx, measured\nCzechoslovak Journal of Physics, Vol. 55 (2005), No. 0\n\nA\n\n1\n\n\fA. Dainese et al.\n\nin the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), and transition radiation, measured in the\nTransition Radiation Detector (TRD), is expected reject 99.99% of the pions (10\u22124\nmisidentification probability) and 100% of the heavier hadrons, while correctly tagging 80% of the electrons.\nThe main sources of background electrons are: decays of primary D mesons,\nwhich have a branching ratio of \u2248 10% in the semi-electronic channels [3], and\nan expected production yield larger by a factor about 20 with respect to that\nof B mesons [4]; \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays and decays of light mesons (mainly \u03c1, \u03c9, K);\nconversions of photons in the beam pipe or in the inner layer of the Inner Tracking\nSystem (ITS), and pions misidentified as electrons.\nGiven that electrons from beauty have average transverse impact parameter\n(distance of closest approach to the interaction vertex in the plane transverse to\nthe beam direction) d0 \u2243 500 \u03bcm, it is possible to minimize the background contributions by selecting electron tracks displaced from the primary vertex. Tracking in\nthe TPC and ITS, that includes two layers of silicon pixel detectors, provides a measurement of the impact parameter with a resolution \u03c3d0 [\u03bcm] \u2248 11+53/(pt [GeV/c]),\ni.e. better than 65 \u03bcm for pt > 1 GeV/c. The d0 distributions reported in Fig. 1\n(left) show that a lower cut on the impact parameter allows to reject misidentified\n\u03c0 \u00b1 and e\u00b1 from Dalitz decays and photon conversions (the former mostly come from\n> 1 GeV/c).\nthe primary vertex and the latter have small impact parameter for pt \u223c\n3\n\nResults: sensitivity on the b-decay electron cross section\n\nAs it can be seen from Fig. 1 (left), the impact parameter cut d0 > 200 \u03bcm is\nexpected to give a b/c ratio larger than unity for the electron sample with pt >\n1 GeV/c. This cut also removes most of the background electrons from \u03c0 0 Dalitz\ndecays and \u03b3 conversions, as well as the primary \u03c0 \u00b1 misidentified as electrons.\nThe expected statistics for electrons from b decays for 107 central Pb\u2013Pb events\n(one month of data taking at nominal Pb\u2013Pb luminosity) is shown in the right-hand\npanel of Fig. 1, along with the residual background contributions. About 8 \u00d7 104\nbeauty electrons are expected above 2 GeV/c in pt , allowing the measurement of\nthe pt -differential cross section in the range 2 < pt < 18 GeV/c. The residual contamination of about 10% of electrons from prompt charm decays, from misidentified\ncharged pions and \u03b3-conversion electrons is accumulated in the low-pt region.\nAfter applying the d0 cut, in a given pt interval [e.g. the bins in Fig 1 (right)], N\n'electrons' will be counted, being the sum of different contributions, N = Nb (beauty)+\nNc (charm) + Nbkg (bkg e and misid. \u03c0). The following procedure is foreseen to extract the cross section of electrons from beauty.\n1. Subtraction of charm decay electrons. We plan to use the cross section for D0\nmesons, measured in ALICE in the K\u2212 \u03c0 + decay channel [6, 7], to estimate\nthe Nc contribution. This will introduce a systematic error coming from the\nstatistical and systematic errors on the D0 cross section. The error is expected\nto be smaller than 5% for pt > 2 GeV/c.\n2.

Besides the systematic errors, we also show the relative statistical\nerror Nb + Nc + Nbkg /Nb : it is expected to increase from less than 1% at pt =\n2 GeV/c to about 12% at 18 GeV/c, for 107 central events (one month at nominal\nluminosity).
