We elaborate on a general method that we recently introduced for characterizing the \"natural\"\nstructures in complex physical systems via a multi-scale network based approach for the data mining\nof such structures. The approach is based on \"community detection\" wherein interacting particles are\npartitioned into \"an ideal gas\" of optimally decoupled groups of particles. Specifically, we construct a\nset of network representations (\"replicas\") of the physical system based on interatomic potentials and\napply a multiscale clustering (\"multiresolution community detection\") analysis using information-based\ncorrelations among the replicas. Replicas may be (i) different representations of an identical static system\nor (ii) embody dynamics by when considering replicas to be time separated snapshots of the system (with a\ntunable time separation) or (iii) encode general correlations when different replicas correspond to different\nrepresentations of the entire history of the system as it evolves in space-time. Inputs for our method are\nthe inter-particle potentials or experimentally measured two (or higher order) particle correlations. We\napply our method to computer simulations of a binary Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones system in a mixture\nratio of A80 B20 , a ternary model system with components \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" in ratios of A88 B7 C5 (as in\nAl88 Y7 Fe5 ), and to atomic coordinates in a Zr80 Pt20 system as gleaned by reverse Monte Carlo analysis of\nexperimentally determined structure factors. We identify the dominant structures (disjoint or overlapping)\nand general length scales by analyzing extrema of the information theory measures. We speculate on\npossible links between (i) physical transitions or crossovers and (ii) changes in structures found by this\nmethod as well as phase transitions associated with the computational complexity of the community\ndetection problem. We briefly also consider continuum approaches and discuss the shear penetration depth\nin elastic media; this length scale increases as the system becomes increasingly rigid.\nPACS. 89.75.Fb \u2013 64.60.Cn \u2013 89.65.-s\n\n1 Introduction\nThis article constitutes a longer companion work to an\nearlier summary [1] in which the basic notions to be detailed here for complex physical systems were succinctly\noutlined. We begin by briefly reviewing a special class of\ncomplex physical systems that is of great fundamental\nand technological importance \u2013 that of amorphous materials. From a practical standpoint, these materials often\nhave industrial processing and preparation advantages [2,\n3] relative to crystalline systems enabling, e.g., greater\nsolubility of pharmaceuticals [4] and many other advantages [2, 5]. Below, we list several specific complex amorphous systems.

The\nunderstanding of the character of such non-trivial structures is a problem of considerable interest in disparate\narenas.\nIn perfect crystals, the natural system scales are evident by the regular ordering of the lattice. The fundamental unit cells of a crystal typically involve several atoms\nthat are replicated in a simple pattern to span the entire\nsystem. There are no intermediate scale structures within\nthe system from the atomic scale of the lattice up to the\ncomplete single crystal. Identifying the basic periodic unit\ncells is vital to the understanding of all crystalline solids.\n\n\f2\n\nP.

Early on, the existence\nof specific unit cell structures were postulated to exist in\ncrystals based on the sharp facets and other macroscopic\nproperties of large crystals.\nThere are more complex systems in which new structures appear on additional intermediate scales between the\natomic-scale and the macro-scale of the system.

A striking property of glass formers (especially\nphous state.

[In Appendix A, we review these information\ntheory measures.] In essence, different copies of the community detection problem are given to different solvers\n(\"replicas\"). If many of these solvers strongly agree regarding certain features of the solution, then these aspects\nare more likely to be correct. Similarly, a large discrepancy may indicate large fluctuations on a particular scale\n(or scales). Extrema in NMI or VI among the results of\nthese independent solvers then indicate the best scales for\nthe network.\nMultiple extrema can therefore indicate the existence\nof multiple relevant length/time scales. Although in most\nphysical instances there is only a single dominant correlation length, there are many other cases in which more\nthan one length/time scale is present [77].\nOne distinction between our work and some other established studies of local structures in glasses is that our\nanalysis is not looking strictly at the positional structure.\nRather, it evaluates structures in terms of the potential\nenergies (i.e., the internal binding energies of the clusters,\nsee also [22]). Our method can encapsulate weights that\nrepresent general statistical (pair of higher order) stress\n(or other) correlation functions, relative atomic displacements, etc.\nOur approach provides a perspective different from\nthe \"point-to-set\" [78, 79, 34] and other methods [41]. The\npoint-to-set method examines the overlap between configurations in a given volume (a \"cavity\") in an equilibrated\nsystem and compares those to configurations in the same\ncavity of the equilibrated system in which the boundary of\nthe cavity was held fixed.

Dynamic heterogeneities involving cooperative motion of structures in\na glass have also been studied [51, 52, 53, 54, 55].\nViable characterizations of SRO and MRO structures\nwere advanced for low [56] and high [49] solute concentrations, binary [56, 49], and multicomponent systems [44].\nSome methods of characterizing local structures include Voronoi tesselation [57, 31, 56], Honeycutt-Andersen\nindices [58], and bond orientation ordering parameters\n[59]. These local measures center on an atom or a given\nlink and, by definition, are restricted from detecting more\ncomplex longer range general structures.\nExperimental means to directly measure MRO structures are given in [60, 61]. Some potential MRO clusters\nwere examined [22, 56, 49]. Some approaches to understand\nMRO use pattern matching to idealized MRO structures\noften constructed as agglomerations of perfectly ordered\nSRO features.\nA very useful experimentally driven approach for ascertaining MRO has been to look for \"prepeaks\" in X-ray\nand neutron scattering data [that is, peaks in the structure factor S(q) that appear for wavenumbers q, corresponding to the inverse interatomic distances, which are\nlower in magnitude than that corresponding to the dominant S(q) peak]. We remark here that while this approach\nmay capture general MRO structures, it is possible to have\nsuch structures without structure factor prepeaks (see Appendix C).\n\n\f4\n\nP.

That is, we work within the NVE\nensemble. After allowing for system equilibration, we save\ns high temperature configurations separated by a fixed period of simulation time. Prior to cooling, the length scales\nin the system are changed by 1% to account for the increase in density as a result of cooling since we choose\nto cool the system in an NVT ensemble to control the\ntemperature. The system is then rapidly quenched to a\ntemperature of T = 300 K, and it is allowed to equilibrate\n(in a mostly frozen state) in an NVE ensemble. We again\nsave s separate low temperature configurations separated\nby a long period of simulation time.\n3.2 Lennard-Jones glass\nWe additionally test the ubiquitous Lennard-Jones potential using the Kob-Andersen (KA) 80:20 binary liquid [86]\nwhich lies in the glass-forming mixture region [87].

The system\nis initialized at a temperature of T = 5 (using energy\nunits where the Boltzmann constant kB = 1) and allowed\nto evolve for a long time. We save s high temperature\nconfigurations separated by 1000 time steps. The time step\nsize is \u2206t = 0.0069 in LJ time units. Then, the system is\nrapidly quenched to a temperature of T = 0.01 which is\nwell below the glass transition temperature of the KA-LJ\nsystem. The system is evolved in this mostly frozen state,\nand we save s low temperature configurations separated\nby 1000 steps of simulation time.\n\n4 Multiresolution clustering on amorphous\nmaterials\nOur idea is to apply, for the first time, multiresolution\nnetwork analysis methods to ascertain all pertinent structures in complex amorphous materials. A key subcomponent of this analysis is the community detection method\nitself. We first explain these ideas in network analysis and\ntheir physical analogs.\n4.1 Physical Motivation\nIn an ideal decomposition of a large system into decoupled\nsubsystems (communities), there is no interaction between\ndifferent communities, and the system is effectively that\nof an ideal gas of disjoint communities. Stated differently,\n\n5\n\nin the simplest setting in which the Hamiltonian would\nbe block diagonal, the evolution of nodes (e.g., atoms) in\neach community would be decoupled from all other nodes\nin other communities. We next consider a fundamental\nNewtonian many particle setting. If the total force on a\ncluster is zero (i.e., if the cluster is strongly decoupled\nfrom all others) F cluster = 0 then, the particles in that\ncluster will drift (on average) with a uniform velocity (the\ncenter of mass velocity of that cluster), i.e., v \u2248 const.\n[88]\nIn such instances, we may treat each community as a\ndifferent particle in an ideal gas of non interacting such\nparticles. The general problem is to find (the time dependent) permutation that renders the pair interaction\nstrengths and/or correlations between particles into the\nbest possible block diagonal form (on the time scale chosen). Community detection emulates this for graphs. In\nthe atomic realization that we discuss in this article, this\nemulates a partition of the system into optimally decoupled clusters such that the system may be viewed as an\n\"ideal gas\" of decoupled communities.\nFor slow cooling of a liquid which enables crystallization, a first order or critical transition appears in the community detection problem. A similar transition is materialized in many slowly cooled liquids as they crystallize to\nform nicely ordered solids. By contrast, in an extremely\nrapid cooling of a liquid, the interactions between the particles are similar to those in spin-glass systems (i.e., the\nparticles are not nicely organized and consequently the\ninter-particle interactions harbor a large degree of randomness). It is notable that a spin-glass transition appears\nin the community detection problem for random graphs\n[89].\n\n4.2 Community detection\nIn a graph such as that depicted in Fig. 3, nodes correspond to abstracted fundamental elements of the system, and edges represent defined relationships between\nthe nodes. Community detection describes the problem of\nfinding strongly connected groups of nodes. Nodes in different clusters are more weakly connected than the nodes\nbelonging to the same cluster. As alluded to earlier, we\napply direct physical analogies where a node corresponds\nto a single atom. Edges, and their corresponding weights,\nare directly defined by the associated pair-wise interaction\nenergy (or, in the absence of known interactions, may be\nset by measured inter-particle correlations). Specifically,\nwe use the interatomic potential energies in Eqs. (1) and\n(2). This potential model of the network edges is physically appealing in that finding the best partition for the\nnetwork is akin to minimizing the cluster binding energies\nof the physical system.\nOur Potts model Hamiltonian for community detection\nis [63]\nH({\u03c3}) = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1X\nAij \u2212 \u03b3Bij \u03b4(\u03c3i , \u03c3j ).\n2\ni6=j\n\n(3)\n\n\f6\n\nP.

Panel (a) depicts our replica construction for the physical system at a \"static\" time t0 (no time separation between\nreplicas, see Appendix K). For presentation purposes, only a few nodes (atoms) are illustrated. Panel (b) depicts a similar set\nof replicas separated by a time \u2206t between successive replicas. In both panels (a) and (b), we generate a model network for\neach replica using the potential energy between the atoms as the respective edge weights for the network. Independently, within\neach replica, we then subsequently minimize Eq. (3) at a given value of \u03b3 using the algorithm briefly described in Sect. 4.2.\nAfterwards, we use the information measures in Appendix A to evaluate how strongly the set of replicas agree on the best\npartition.\n\nof the matrices Aij and Bij are the edge weights and are\ndefined as follows: an \"attractive\" weight has Aij > 1 if\nnodes i and j are connected, Aij = 0 if the nodes are not\nconnected, a \"repulsive\" weight has Bij \u2265 0 if the nodes\nare not connected, and Bij = 0 if nodes i and j are connected. In this paper, we define model the weights Aij and\nBij by pair-wise potential energies (see Sect. 5). In principle, we can generalize the Hamiltonian to include n-body\ncorrelations or interactions.\n\nAij\n\nBij\n\nFig. 3. An arbitrary weighted network with 4 natural communities (strongly connected) depicted as distinct node shapes.\nThe goal in community detection is to identify any such\nstrongly related clusters of nodes based on their defined edge\nrelationships. Solid lines depict weighted links corresponding\nto complimentary or attractive relationships where Aij > 0\nand Bij = 0 in Eq. (3). Gray dashed lines depict missing, adversarial, or repulsive relationships where Aij = 0 and Bij > 0\nin Eq. (3). In both cases, the relative link weight is indicated\nby the respective line thicknesses. For presentation purposes,\nmissing intercommunity edges are not depicted. In this paper,\nwe directly relate the edges (attractive and missing/repulsive)\nto the interaction energy between pairs of atoms which implies\nthat the natural groups would correspond to bound clusters of\natoms.\n\nGlobally minimizing this Hamiltonian corresponds to identifying strongly connected clusters of nodes. The elements\n\nWe split the \"attractive\" (ferromagnetic) and \"repulsive\" (anti-ferromagnetic) contributions into two separate\nweighted matrices in order to insert the model weight \u03b3\nthat adjusts the energy trade-off between the two types of\ninteractions. The parameter \u03b3 allows us to vary the target scale of the community solution. The spin states \u03c3i\ndesignate the community membership of each node i with\na range 1 \u2264 \u03c3i \u2264 q where q is the number of communities. This number q may be variable [62, 63](such as in the\nmulti-resolution that we perform in the current work) in\norder to find the optimal solutions or held fixed. Node i\nis a member of community k if \u03c3i = k. In this Hamiltonian, each spin \u03c3i interacts only with other spins in its\nown community.\nBriefly, using Eq. (3) our community detection algorithm rapidly moves nodes between communities based on\nthe current lowest energy assignment until no more moves\nare possible (see also Appendix B). We then attempt t\nindependent trials and select the lowest energy trial as\nthe best division. [62, 63] [The number of trials serves as\nour optimization parameter in this greedy algorithm. It\neffectively allows the algorithm to explore more possible\nconfigurations before selecting the best configuration for\na given replica. The number of required trials in order\nto achieve a prescribed accuracy monitors the computational complexity (correlating with the number of local\nminima in which individual trials may get stuck). Somewhat better optimization could be obtained with a heat\n\n\fP. Ronhovde et al.: Detecting hidden spatial and spatio-temporal structures in glasses\n\n4.3 Multiresolution community detection\nMultiresolution methods [90, 91, 92, 62, 93] extend the ideas\nof community detection to identify the \"best\" division(s)\nover a range of network scales (\"resolutions\"). We test s\nindependent realizations of the system (\"replicas\") over all\nrelevant network scales by specifying different values of \u03b3\nin Eq. (3). Networks with a weakly defined structure will\nresult in more diverse solutions among the different replicas. Conversely, strongly defined structures will result in\nreplica solutions that agree more strongly. When replicas\nrepresent time-separated configurations, a strong agreement among the replicas corresponds to consistent physical structures over time. The time separation between\ndifferent snapshot can be tuned to find the corresponding\npertinent structures for general time scales. The particular case of vanishing time separation corresponds to different representations of the same static system. See Fig.\n4. In the particular case of vanishing time separation, we\npermute, for identical nodes (atoms), the numbers labeling the nodes within the network; this leads to replicas\ncorresponding to different initial starting points for the\nalgorithm described in Sect. 4.2. [Another possibility now\nshown in Fig. 4 is that of replicas being different copies of\nthe same system as it evolves in space-time (i.e., a replica\nnot corresponding to a given snapshot of the system at\n\n1 .0\n\n(a )\n\n6\n\n(ia )\n\n5\n6\n\n4\n\n0 .8\n\n8\n\nq\n\n0 .6\n\nI\n\nN\n\n2\n\n3\n\nI\n\n4\n\n1 0\n\n0 .4\n\n2\nI\n\n0 .2\n\n2\nN\n\n1\n\nI\nq\n\n0 .0\n1 0\n\n-5\n\n1 0\n\n-4\n\n1 0\n\n-3\n\n1 0\n\n-2\n\n1 0\n\n-1\n\n\u03b3\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n1\n\n1 0\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n3\n\n1 0\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n1 0\n\n6\n\n(b )\n\n1 0\n\n8\n5\n6\n\n4\n\n8\n\nq\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\nV\n\n4\n\n4\n\n1 0\n\n(ib )\n\nH\n\nbath solution algorithm [89] at a cost of substantially increased computational effort.] This community detection\nalgorithm partitions the network into communities by assigning a unique cluster membership for each node. Further details are provided in the appendices.\nLocal features in metallic glasses generally exhibit interconnecting short range structures [56]. In our community detection problem, this feature corresponds to allowing \"overlapping\" node memberships where atoms can be\nmembers of more than one local cluster. We incorporate\nthis effect by assigning a node as a secondary member of\nevery community for which it has a negative binding energy in terms our Potts model in Eq. (3) (see Appendix\nB).\nWe can express the general partition function for a\ncommunity partition with inter-community interactions\nwhich may correspond to the surface terms of clusters in\nRandom First Order Transition theory (RFOT). Our parameter \u03b3 effectively plays the role of scaling the relation\nbetween surface and bulk terms in RFOT. A high value\nof \u03b3 corresponds to large surface effects while a small \u03b3\ncorresponds to dominant bulk effects.\nSeveral strengths of our method are listed below. The\nanalysis is independent of the type of structures that are\nbeing analyzed (structured, amorphous solid, and possibly even liquid systems). It is robust to noise in the model\nnetwork, and it yields very accurate results with a simple\nand fast greedy algorithm [63]. Because edge assignments\nare based on relative node positions (through the interaction potential), our method should be robust with respect\nto translational or rotational motion of solid structures in\nthe system (such as crystal nucleation).\n\n7\n\n2\nV\n2\n\n2\nH\n\n1\n\nq\n0\n0\n1 0\n\n-5\n\n1 0\n\n-4\n\n1 0\n\n-3\n\n1 0\n\n-2\n\n1 0\n\n-1\n\n1 0\n\n\u03b3\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n1\n\n1 0\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n3\n\n1 0\n\n0\n\n4\n\nFig. 6.

This latter possibility will be\nalluded to in Appendix R.]\nWithin this framework, we identify the best resolution(s) by analyzing how well the independent replica solutions agree with each other in terms of information content [62]. See Fig. 5 for a schematic involving time separated replicas. Extremal correlated resolution(s) identify\nthe best division(s) of the network. We apply the variation of information (VI) V metric and the normalized\nmutual information (NMI) IN measure to evaluate the\nlevel of similarity among all pairs of the s replicas (see\nAppendix A). Extrema correspond to locally stable solutions that remain locally unchanged for variations in\nthe system scale. In the case of very stable system resolutions, local extrema can be replaced by plateaus in these\ninformation theory measures that indicate no change in\nthe system solution over an extended range of resolution\nscales \u03b3 (as seen in the networks examined in [62] and,\nin the appendix of the current work, in some crisp lattice\nsystems analyzed in Appendix O). We can further extract\nadditional qualitative information about the \"stability\" of\nnetwork partitions across a range of resolutions by examining the average number of clusters q [90, 91, 94], mutual\ninformation I [90], or the Shannon entropy H [62, 94].\n\n\f8\n\nP.

This further\nindicates when, physically, the system might be analyzed\n\nFig. 8. A depiction of the full partitioned system where\nunique cluster memberships are depicted as distinct colors\n(best viewed in color).

It also enables us, by varying the parameters and\ntemperature to map out when a solution is present or not,\nto determine whether the solutions found can be trusted\nand are physically relevant.\nWhen solving the system of Eq. (3) at non-zero temperature for a given network (i.e., for an atomic configuration that is held fixed), entropic effects can, on their own,\nlead to a transition as the temperature is increased [89].\nThis transition corresponds to a spin glass type transition for random systems capturing a transition from easy\nto hard computational problems.

We briefly elaborate on this\nidea below. As illustrated in the examples analyzed in this\nwork, spatially increasing low temperature structures in a\nsupercooled liquid as well as correlation lengths in systems such as the Ising spin systems can be ascertained\nvia our method. In a general decomposition of an interacting system into optimally decoupled groups of particles\n(\"communities\"), the partition function is approximated\nas\nZ'\n\nX\n{\u039b}\n\ng(\u039b)\n\nq\u039b\nY\n\nzc .\n\n(4)\n\nc=1\n\nHere, zc is the partition function as computed with the\nHamiltonian of the entire system for the particles in community c, g(\u039b) is the frequency of obtaining a particular\nset of communities \u039b in a decomposition of the entire system into optimally disjoint communities, and q\u039b is the total number of communities in the partition \u039b. Thus, physical transitions or crossovers may, in this approximation,\nbe related to transitions (or divergent scales) or crossovers\nin the communities found in \u039b themselves and/or phase\n\nFig. 10. A depiction of some of the best clusters of the low\ntemperature (T = 300K) ternary system at the peak replica\ncorrelation at feature (i) in Fig. 6. These clusters include overlapping node membership assignments where each node is required to have an overall negative binding energy to the other\nnodes in the cluster. The atomic identities are C (red), A (silver), B (green) in order of increasing diameters.\n\n\f10\n\nP. Ronhovde et al.: Detecting hidden spatial and spatio-temporal structures in glasses\n\n5 Multiresolution application to model glass\nformers\nWe assign edges between the nodes (atoms) with the respective weights based on the empirical pair-potentials\ngiven by Eqs. (1) and (2). Specifically, we calculate the\npotential energy \u03c6ij between each pair of nodes i and j\nin the system and then shift each value by a constant\n\u03c60 to obtain \u03c60ij = \u03c6ij + \u03c60 (assuming that \u03c6ij \u2192 0 as\nthe distance between particles i and j tends to infinity\n(r \u2192 \u221e)). The shift \u03c60 > 0 is necessary for the community detection algorithm to properly partition the network\nof atoms since it provides an objective definition of which\ninteratomic spacings are preferable for a well-defined cluster and which are preferred to be excluded from a cluster.\nIn our particular application here, we calculate the average potential energy of the system and set \u03c60 = \u2212\u03c6avg .\nFor use in Eq. (3), we define an edge with a weight Aij =\n\u2212\u03c60ij between nodes i and j if \u03c60ij < 0, and we weight\nany missing links (or \"repulsive edges\") by Bij = \u03c60ij if\n\u03c60ij \u2265 0. We then solve both model systems over a large\nrange of \u03b3 using s = 12 replicas and t = 10 optimization\ntrials per replica.\nWhile \u03c60 = \u2212\u03c6avg is an intuitive shift that accomplishes the goal of an objective cluster definition here, it\nis not an appropriate shift for some problems. For example, using \u03c60 = \u2212\u03c6avg turns out to be problematic in some\ncases for lattice models. In a general setting, we examine\na continuum of potential shifts \u03c60 and monitor extrema\nin the information theory measures as a function of both\n\u03b3 in Eq. (3) and \u03c60 .\nIn addition to the systems tested below, we applied\nthe algorithm to various test cases including square, triangular, and cubic lattice structures. The algorithm is\nable to correctly identify the natural leading order scales\n(plaquettes and composites of plaquettes as \"cascades\" in\nthe information theory correlations). Further testing in-\n\n\u03a7\n\nvolved two-dimensional defects (dislocations, interstitials,\netc.) and domain walls in a lattice. Defects in triangular\nlattices occurred most frequently near cluster boundaries.\nWe also tested static configurations for the ternary\nmodel glass system where each replica is a model of the\nsame configuration. There we detected structures in both\nlow and high temperatures where the high temperature\n\"structures\" are more fragile (that is, harder to solve in\nthe clustering problem). This corresponds to identifying\nrelevant transient features in a dense liquid.\n5.1 Ternary model glass results\nIn Figs. 6 and 7, panels (a) and (b) show the information\ntheory based correlations (averaged over all replica pairs\nas in [62]) over a range of network resolutions. The lower\ntemperature system at T = 300 K in Fig. 6(a) shows a\npeak NMI at (ia) with a corresponding VI minimum at\n(ib). Fig. 8 depicts an example of the full system partition. Fig. 9 shows some sample clusters within the simulation bounding box at resolution parameter value of\n\u03b3best ' 0.001 where we include overlapping node memberships (the replicas correlations are calculated on partitions), and Fig. 10 depicts additional samples of the best\nclusters. The corresponding high temperature (T = 1500\nK) solutions have a much lower NMI at \u03b3best ' 0.001 indicating significantly worse agreement among replicas. That\nis, one would expect that the high temperature system\nT = 1500 K is in a liquid state, so any observed features\nare not dynamically stable across all replicas (snapshots of\nthe system over time). At T = 300 K, the best structures\nhave consistent cluster sizes that are exclusively MRO.\nThe plateau regions for \u03b3 > 10 are similar to the LJ\nplot in Fig. 12, but in this system the NMI plateau is\nlower. In the high temperature case in Fig. 7, there are additional \"almost-plateaus\" for the range 0.001 . \u03b3 . 0.1.\nThese plateaus represent a region of structural transition,\nbut we are not concerned with them because the replica\ncorrelations are very low.\n\n0.05\n\n5.2 Binary Lennard-Jones glass results\n\n0.00\n- 0.05\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\npout\n\n0.5\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\nT\n\n1.5\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\nFig. 11.

The lower temperature system at a temperature of T = 5 (in units of kB = 1) in Fig. 6(a) shows a\nplateau in NMI at (ia) with a corresponding VI plateau at\n(ib) which are the local extrema (V = 0 is a trivial solution with only one cluster in this problem).

The corresponding higher temperature solutions at \u03b3best ' 104\n(see Figs. 14 and15) have a lower NMI (indicating a weak\nagreement among replicas). The dependence number of\nreplicas (See Fig. 15) required to achieve high accuracy\nunderscores the faint agreement between contending solutions and the high temperature complexity of the problem. Our identified structures for this LJ model system\n\n\fP.

We do not bias the expected configurations\nin any way. The required input is that of inter-particle\ninteractions (or measured correlations as further detailed\nin Appendix N). Information theory extrema (including\nplateaus) between contending solutions give the different\npertinent structures on all important length scales (lattice scales and correlation lengths) of the system in an\nunbiased unified way.\nApart from benchmarks on general networks and on\nlattices and spin systems with and without defects (see\nAppendices O,P,Q), to illustrate the feasibility of this approach, we focused in this work on structural glasses. The\ndetection of structure in structural glasses is a heavily investigated hard problem.

Our analysis evaluates structures in terms\nthe potential energies (i.e., the internal binding energies\nof the clusters). This approach differs from some other\nmethods of structural analysis that look strictly at the\nrelative atomic positions. We briefly comment on the relation between our work and that of simpler mode analysis of the interactions \u2013 the latter have been indeed been\nused to detect a link between spatial structure and local dynamics [53, 95]. Local heterogeneous dynamics was\nshown to be correlated with topological defects [96] and\nthus (as a consequence of [53, 95]) with the system modes.\n(Indeed, a recent work [97] directly reaffirms such a connection.) Similarly, some old variants of graph partitioning methods such as direct spectral clustering [98, 99] as\nwell as community detection employ a normal mode analysis [71]. Indeed, a method based on particle dynamics in\nhigh dimensions enabled multi-scale community detection\n[72]. Other different yet conceptually related approaches\nalso include oscillator synchronization analogies [100, 73].\nIn the above approaches, physical analogies were made. It\nis thus natural to suspect that the approach may inverted\nand that community detection will link spatial structure\nwith dynamics in a broad class of physical systems where\nthe physics based analysis of the interacting multi-particle\nsystem is hampered by the shear complexity of the problem. The current work indeed fleshes out this link in detail and introduces a method for the direct detection of\ngeneral spatio-temporal structures in rather general physical systems. Notably, via the use of information theory\ncorrelations and extrema as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters therein (\u03b3 of our defining Hamiltonian\nof Eq. 3 and \u03c60 of Sect. 5), we are able to identify in an\nunbiased way all of the natural scales of the system. In\nmore rudimentary approaches this needs to introduced by\nhand (e.g., a cutoff on mode occupancy in spectral based\n\n\f12\n\nP. Ronhovde et al.: Detecting hidden spatial and spatio-temporal structures in glasses\n\napproaches) and it is not obvious how to determine all\npertinent structures of a complex physical system.\nOur approach identifies MRO as the dominant feature\nof our ternary model glass former with no strongly defined SRO. In contrast, the LJ system shows a largely SRO\nstructure with adjunct atoms that create near-MRO structures. Compounding the changes in structure that we find\nby analyzing the atomic system at different temperatures\nand minimizing the energy function to determine the optimal division into clusters, there are also entropic effects.\nThe distribution of optimal partitions becomes wider and\nless pronounced due to these effects as the temperature\nincreases. This is a validation of our arguments in Sect.\n4.3.1.\nOn a lattice, plateaus in information theory correlation\nsteps correspond to a cascade of structures starting from\nthe smallest dyads of nodes, to basic plaquette structures\n(square, triangle, etc.), and growing ever larger (two joined\nplaquettes etc.). In Ising spin systems at different temperatures on a square lattice, the domains of \"+\" and \"\u2212\"\nspins are separated from one another by domain walls. The\ninformation theory plateaus correspond similarly to the\ncascade of small plaquette structures found on the lattice\nitself (i.e., the single plaquette, two joined plaquettes etc.)\nup to a cutoff scale set by the domain wall. This is sensible since no clear structure is found beyond the domain\n\n1 .0\n\n(a )\nI\n\nN\n\n8\n\n4\n6\n\n3\n\nI\n\n0 .8\nq\n\nI\n\nN\n\n2\n\nq\n\n0 .6\n\n2\n\n0 .2\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n8\n\n4\n6\n\n3\n4\n\n2\n\n0 .0\n1 0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n1\n\n1 0\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n3\n\n\u03b3\n\n1 0\n\n4\n\n1 0\n\n5\n\n1 0\n\n(b )\n\n1 0\n\n1 0\n\n4\n\nI\n0 .4\n\n8\n\nV\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n\nH\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n4\n\nH\n\nV\n\n2\n\nq\n\n6\n\nq\n0\n1 0\n\n-1\n\n1 0\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n1\n\n1 0\n\n\u03b3\n\n2\n\n1 0\n\n3\n\n1 0\n\n4\n\n1 0\n\n5\n\nFig. 14.

(3) using the algorithm\nbriefly explained in Sect. 4.2, models a dynamic community detection process where we search for a local energy\nminimum that indicates a \"good\" community partition\n(in general). In particular, we have applied a potential\nenergy (PE) model of network edges, and we could, in\nprinciple, apply other edge definitions to obtain other relevant configurations with the following caveat. When we\nminimize the Hamiltonian using the edge weights, a low\nenergy state corresponds to a good partition, so for consistency with the community detection problem, any edge\ndefinitions should ideally be extremized at the most favorable configuration(s). The subtle distinctions between\na few different natural edge weight models can result in\ndifferent calculated clusters (beyond natural fluctuation\ncaused by a high configurational entropy).\nAn inverted PE model fits the above criterion, and it\nwould at first appear to be conceptually consistent with\na model based on the relative pairwise squared node displacement (SND) model. For both cases, small deflections\nabout the minimum still indicate a good, even if not optimal, configuration corresponding to the intuitive notion\nof a bound cluster. However, the SND model would cause\na perfect crystal to be identified as a single contiguous\ncluster. The PE would not have this effect since more distant nodes have a much lower potential energy. In effect,\nthe PE model could identify the smaller scale units in a\nperfect crystal that the SND model could not isolate.\nAnother intuitive edge model for bound clusters is related to the attractive force that one may expect to exist between constituent elements of a physical cluster. Of\ncourse, the system forces still cause the formation of a\ncrystalline ground under the appropriate conditions, but\nthe forces dictate the system's physical dynamics over\ntime where the PE model (more) directly indicates the relevant ground state(s). Forces with a minimum such as the\nLJ model in Eq. (2) would be zero at the optimal ground\nstate configuration (ideal crystal state), and the maximum\nforce would be at a larger radius r than the PE minimum.\nWhile a force model of edge weights is also intuitive, it\nwould correspond to (perhaps slightly) different clusters\nin a physical system compared to clusters derived from a\nPE model because the community detection Hamiltonian\nis extremized at different radii.\nThis discussion of the subtle differences between the\nedge models leads to the natural question of which is the\n\"best\" physical cluster model. Another perspective is that\nthe different edge weight models simply answer different\nquestions. We have selected the PE definition since it best\ncorresponds to the ideal ground state of the system in\nour pairwise interaction model. We then infer the best\nlocal clusters within configurations in local (frustrated)\nequilibrium (in the solid systems).\n\n\fP. Ronhovde et al.: Detecting hidden spatial and spatio-temporal structures in glasses\n\nC MRO and structure factor pre-peaks\nOne experimental approach to ascertain MRO is to look\nfor \"prepeaks\" in the scattering data. That is, one can\nlook for lower amplitude peaks in the structure factor S(q)\nwhich precede the dominant S(q) peak for wavenumbers q.\nWhile the approach may capture general MRO structures,\nit is possible to have MRO structures without significant\npre-peak(s) in the structure factor plot.\nWe illustrate the basic premise of this statement with\nan elementary example \u2013 that of a random arrangement\nof crystallites. Even though the Fourier transform of the\nmass density in each individual crystallite has sharp peaks\nat the reciprocal lattice vectors corresponding to these\nsmall crystallites, the structure factor obtained from the\nentire system may have those peaks vanish.

This process iterates through all nodes as many\ntimes as necessary until no node additions or removals are\nfound. The total computational cost is slightly higher than\nthe initial partitioning cost in Sect. 4.2 due to the multiple\nallowed memberships. See also [92] for another method\nthat allows overlapping multiscale network analysis in a\ngeneral fashion.\n\nE Potential shift in the ternary metallic glass\nIn Fig. 16, we show the NMI correlations for a range of\npotential shifts \u03c60 and the Potts model weights \u03b3 using\ns = 12 replicas and t = 10 trials for all data. The NMI\npeaks are roughly constant over a range of \u03c60 for the\nternary model glass up to \u03c60 = 0.1 (the A-A interaction\nminimum \u03c6min ' 0.24 eV).\n\nF Time correlations in the ternary model\nglass\nIn Fig. 17, we show the NMI correlations for a range of\nseparation times ts between replicas (units are in MD time\nsteps) and the Potts model weights \u03b3 using s = 12 replicas\nand t = 10 trials for all data. This plot intuitively shows\nthat the correlations weaken as we increase the separation\n\nRi\n\nmay vanish if the relative distances between the different\ncrystallites are random and lead to phases exp(ik * Ri )\nwhich\n\u0001 obliterate the signatures of order in the individual\nSi k .\n\nD Overlapping nodes between different\ncommunities\nWe wish to account for the possibility of a given atom\nbeing connected to more than one physical cluster. For\nexample, in a cubic lattice, each atom participates in the\nlocal structure of multiple unit cells. In community detection, this corresponds to allowing \"overlapping\" community memberships where a node can be a member of more\nthan one community. To accomplish this task, we select\nthe lowest energy partition at the best resolution(s) of the\nmodel network [i.e., value(s) of \u03b3 in Eq. (3) corresponding\nto extrema in IN or V ].\nFirst, we fix the initial node memberships including the\nnumber of communities q. We then sequentially iterate\nthrough the community memberships of each node and\nmake changes according to the following: (1) place the\nnode in any additional (non-member) clusters to which it\n\nFig. 20.

These clusters include overlapping node membership assignments where each node is required to have a overall\nnegative binding energy to the other nodes in the cluster.

In some instances,\nthe high temperature clusters can be more compact, albeit not densely packed, where panels (c) and (d) show\ntwo examples at s = 20. The clusters that are identified\nare generally consistent in terms of sparseness across all\nclusters in the solution.

In this system, we use a single static \"snapshot\" of\nthe system to analyze what our multiresolution algorithm finds\nat T = 300 K. This low temperature case shows a preferred\nresolution at low \u03b3 as evidenced by the information extrema\nat (i) in both panels. See Fig. 24 for the corresponding high\ntemperature case.\n\nAs an additional note, we remark that, intuitively, one\nwould expect that the VI maxima are directly related to\nthe NMI minimum in this region of \u03b3. This is not the\ncase in this region because the VI metric does to zero as\nthe network collapses to one cluster. It is rapidly shifting from a region of maximum complexity at a peak VI\nvalue, where most of the information comes from the sum\nof the Shannon entropies H(A) and H(B), for two partitions A and B, to minimum complexity at a value of\nV = 0. NMI has a different behavior here, as the ratio\nIN = 2I(A, B)/ [H(A) + H(B)], because the mutual information between different replicas becomes smaller and\napproaches zero as the system collapses into larger communities. The low temperature LJ system in Fig. 12 shows\na transitional very low peak in NMI which corresponds to\na near bisection of the system. However, in this case the\noverlapping cluster configurations collapse to the entire\nsystem.\n\n1 .0\n\n6\n\n(a )\n\n5\n6\n\n4\n\n0 .8\n\n8\n\n0 .6\n\nq\n\nq\nI\n\nN\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0 .4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n0 .4\n\n1 0\n\n6\n\n0 .6\n\nI\n\n5\n\n0 .8\n\n8\n\nN\n\n6\n\n(a )\n\nI\n\n1 .0\n\n17\n\n2\nI\n\n0 .2\n\n2\nN\n\n1\n\nI\n\na5\n6.20*\n3.48\n4.38\n3.00*\n3.00\n8.71*\n\nTable 2.

We also used s = 12 replicas and t = 10\ntrials for all data. The value of \u03b3 corresponding to the\npeak in V scales downward with the system size (larger\nstructures) indicating that the maximum fluctuations are\nscaling with the size of the simulation box. In the limit of\nan infinite size simulation box, the VI peak would tend to\n\u03b3 = 0.\n\nK Static Multi-resolution analysis on ternary\nmodel glass\nThe inter-replica NMI/VI correlations change with the\ntime separation interval between the replicas where the\nlonger time separations intuitively result in poorer correlations. The other limiting case is for a static analysis of the\nsystem. Thus, we are interested in determining what our\nmultiresolution analysis finds when we examine a singletime snapshot of the system. A single snapshot may, potentially, capture a transient feature of the system. This\n\nis illustrated in panel (a) of Fig. 4 in which the time separation between different replicas is set to zero. We applied\nthe same algorithm as in Sect. 4 except that all replicas\ncorrespond to the same system time, and we solved the\nsystems with s = 8 replicas and t = 4 trials per replica. In\nFigs. 23 and 24, our analysis identifies a static length associated with the instantaneous configuration. At both high\nand low temperatures, the static multi-resolution analysis\ndisplay information extrema at low \u03b3 (large spatial scales).\nThe higher temperature system displays weaker correlations with sparser structures whereas the structures of the\nlow temperature system display more significant correlations (and more compact structures). As seen in Figs. 23\nand 24 the high temperature system displays weaker correlations in the vicinity of the peak NMI than those of the\nlow temperature system. That is, the high temperature\nsolutions require more effort to solve accurately (there are\nfar more metastable minima and more trials are required\nin order to find better contending solutions). (A similar\noccurrence was found for the high temperature LJ system\nin Fig. 15.) The solved clusters (not depicted) are comparable to those identified for the time-separated replicas in\nSect. 5 for both system temperatures.\n\n\fP.

These interactions conform to\nthose\nThe lower temperature system at T = 300 K in Fig.\n28(a) shows a peak NMI at (ia) with a corresponding VI\nminimum at (ib). Following Sect. 5.1, Fig. 31 depicts a\nsample of the best clusters at \u03b3best ' 0.001 where we include overlapping node memberships (the replicas correlations are calculated on partitions). We used s = 12 replicas\nand t = 20 trials per replica. The corresponding T = 1500\nK high temperature solutions have a much lower NMI at\n\u03b3best ' 0.001 indicating very poor agreement among the\nreplicas. At T = 300 K, the best structures have consistent cluster sizes that are MRO or a little larger which\nare generally larger than 1/2 the simulated system width.\nTherefore, it would beneficial to test the consistency of\nthe clusters in a larger system requiring a substantially\nlonger computational time.\nIn this system the NMI plateau at \u03b3 & 100 is actually\nhigher than the configuration at (i), but the clusters are\nalmost exclusively small (n ' 5 nodes) and are not completely contiguous.

This alternate system uses the best parameter\nfit for the same-species interactions as opposed to the pseudopotential interaction used in Figs. 6 \u2013 10. At this temperature,\nthere is no resolution where the replicas are strongly correlated.\nSee Fig. 28 for the corresponding low temperature case where\nthe replicas are much more highly correlated at \u03b3 ' 0.001.\n\nN Multi-resolution analysis via measured pair\ncorrelation function\nAs stated in Sect. 2, we may apply the same multiresolution network clustering ideas for other structure models. In particular, in Fig. 32, we apply the method to experimentally adduced pair correlation functions gab (r) in\nan amorphous ZrPt system between the different of the\ndifferent components a and b (i.e., Zr-Zr, Zr-Pt, and PtPt). That is, we set in Eq. (3), Aij = \u2212(gij + g ij ) if\n(gij + g ij ) < 0 and Bij = (gij \u2212 g ij ) if (gij \u2212 g ij ) > 0.\nHere, gij denotes the pair correlation between the atoms\ncorresponding to nodes i and j, g ij is a background average (which we set to zero). Some sample clusters then\nfound by our method are seen in Fig. 33. Due to the large\nsystem size, we used s = 8 replicas and t = 4 trials per\nreplica.\nAmorphous systems with extended atomic order beyond the nearest neighbor shell provide an excellent framework to test the identification of natural structural elements. The ZrPt is a system that has been shown to have\nMRO in both the glassy and liquid state [103, 104, 105, 106,\n107]. MRO, or correlations beyond direct chemical bonding manifest as pre-peaks in the static structure factor\nextracted from scattering studies of liquids and glasses.\nThe dominant structural elements at the heart of such an\n\nordering are of extreme interest. Atomic configurations\nthat are consistent with the experimentally determined\nscattering data for liquid Zr80 Pt20 at 250 K below the liquidus were generated using conventional Reverse Monte\nCarlo (RMC) methods [108, 109, 110]. The result of analysis uses unconstrained RMC which may or may not emulate the precise microscopic structure. We then analyzed\na representative system with N = 7500 nodes using the\nalgorithm outlined in Sect. 4.3.\nSpecifically, we analyze the system as a static model.\nThat is, each replica is based on the one particular system\nrepresentation since the data is obtained by RMC methods rather than by a dynamical simulation. The multiresolution analysis (MRA) is seen in Fig. 32. A few of\nthe relatively uniform large clusters are shown in Fig. 33\nwhere each cluster is approximately 700 \u2212 800 atoms in\nsize. Interestingly, the ZrPt system shows a well-defined\nsecondary MRA NMI peak near \u03b3 ' 1. Although the peak\nNMI value has a poor overall correlation among the replica\nsolutions (low IN ), it is notable that the system displays\nthis secondary peak since it is entirely absent in the LJ\nbinary liquid results in Sect. 5.2.\n\nO Multiresolution application to lattice\nsystems\nWe define several uniform lattices systems for the purpose of comparing the results to the model glasses where\nwe use relatively small systems for presentation purposes.\nWe would normally just treat respective model networks\nas unweighted networks, but here we wish to maintain a\nconsistent analysis across all systems in the paper, so we\nfurther apply a \"potential\" shift \u03c60 which corresponds to\n\nAA\nAB\nBB\nAC\nBC\nCC\n\n1 .2\n0 .8\n\nV (e V )\n\n20\n\n0 .4\n0 .0\n2\n\n4\n\nr (\u00c5)\n6\n\n8\n\n1 0\n\nFig. 30.

The units are given for a specific candidate atomic\nrealization (AlYFe) discussed in the text.

The atomic identities are\nC (red), A (silver), B (green) in order of increasing diameters. These clusters are generally larger than 1/2 the simulated\nsystem width; therefore, it would beneficial to test their consistency in a larger simulation (requiring substantially longer\ncomputational time).\n1 0\n\n(a )\n\n2 0\n\n8\n\n1 6\n\n0 .6\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2\n\nN\n\n0 .8\n\nq\n\n1 .0\n\nI\n\n0 .2\n\n8\n2\n4\n0\n0\n\nN\n\n4\n\n1 0\n\n0 .4\n\n21\n\nFig. 33.

The plot\nshows a poorly correlated, but nevertheless well-defined, peak\nin NMI near \u03b3 ' 1.\n\nthe negative of the average weight over all pairs of nodes\n(any non-neighbor has a weight of Bij = 1).\nWe allow zero energy moves for the lattice solutions\nand perform a more strenuous optimization using s = 20\nreplicas and t = 40 trials. These representative networks\nresult in \"imperfect\" tilings of the favored local structures\ndue to the constraints imposed by the perfect symmetry\n\nWe define a uniform, initially unweighted, square lattice\nwith N = 400 nodes. Edges are assigned to each neighbor\nin the x and y directions with periodic boundary conditions. The \"potential\" shift is \u03c60 = 0.97995. We then\nperform the same multiresolution analysis to the graph as\nin the previous systems. In Fig. 34, we see that where are\nthree dominant plateaus in the information measures.\nExcept for the plateaus, the overall multiresolution\npattern resembles the LJ system in Fig. 5.2, except for the\npresence of the plateaus in the lattice plot, which suggests\nthat the LJ system is \"more ordered\" than the metallic\nglass model. However, a purely random graph [62] also\nshows a similar pattern, including a plateau, which indicates that there may exist an analogy between purely\n\"random\" and perfectly \"ordered\" systems in our analysis. However, these data are not alone sufficient to be\nconclusive.\nWe select a configuration at \u03b3 = 60 corresponding to\nthe center plateau. The lattice is depicted in Fig. 35 with\nq = 120 clusters of 78 squares, 4 triads, and 38 dyads.\nAt this resolution, the square dominates the configuration\nwhich shows that our algorithm is able to isolate the basic\nunit cells of the lattice in a natural fashion.\nThe plateau for \u03b3 & 100 corresponds to essentially all\ndyads, and the plateau for \u03b3 . 30 corresponds to a mixture of dyads, squares, and tight six-node configurations\n\n\f22\n\nP.

In this configuration, there were q = 120 clusters\nwith 78 squares, 4 triads, and 38 dyads which indicates that\nsquare configuration dominates the partition, and it shows how\nour algorithm can naturally identify the basic unit cells of the\nsquare lattice.\n\nforming its own single-node cluster. Together, the different\nplateaus show that our algorithm is able to isolate the\nbasic unit cells of the lattice in a natural fashion.\n\nO.3 Cubic lattice\nO.2 Triangular lattice\nSimilar to the square lattice we define a uniform, initially unweighted, triangular lattice with N = 400 nodes.\nEdges are assigned to each triangular neighbor using periodic boundary conditions. The \"potential\" shift is \u03c60 =\n0.969925. We again perform the same multiresolution analysis to the graph with the results shown in Fig. 36. There\nare three dominant plateaus in the information measures;\nand the overall multiresolution pattern resembles both the\nsquare lattice and the LJ systems except for the presence\nof the plateaus here.\nWe select a configuration at \u03b3 = 50 corresponding to\nthe \"left\" plateau. The lattice is depicted in Fig. 37 with\nq = 104 clusters of 17 triads, and 86 \"diamonds\", and 1\nfive-node cluster. The five node cluster is a result of a preference being given for an isolated node to join a diamond\nas opposed to forming its own single-node cluster. At this\nresolution, the diamond configuration dominates.\nTwo plateaus to the right of \u03b3 & 65 are both strongly\ndominated by triads of nodes. The distinction between\nthe two is that the central plateau favors an isolated node\njoining a triangle, to form a rare diamond, rather than\n\nWe further define a uniform, initially unweighted, cubic\nlattice with N = 1000 nodes. Edges are assigned to each\nneighbor in the x, y, and z directions using periodic boundary conditions. The \"potential\" shift is \u03c60 = 0.987 988. We\nperform the same multiresolution analysis to the graph as\nin the previous systems where the results are summarized\nin Figs. 38 and 39.\nOut of q = 177 clusters, we identified 66 squares, 51\nsix-node configurations (square plus two adjacent nodes),\n45 cubes, and 15 other assorted configurations smaller\nthan cubes. At \u03b3 ' 50, the cube is the preferred cluster in terms of the cluster energy, but they consist of\nonly slightly more than 25% of the clusters because the\nlarge cube configuration is more difficult to identify due\nto the perfect network symmetry and local constraints imposed by the evolution of the community structure during the algorithm dynamics. The \"middle\" plateau represents a square-dominated region (201 out of 294 clusters\nare squares), and the \"right\" plateau consists of dyads of\nneighbor nodes almost exclusively.\n\n\fP.

A depiction of\nthe system at \u03b3 = 50 for the left plateau is shown in Fig. 37.\n\nP Multiresolution application to a 2D Ising\nlattice\nWe define two-dimensional square lattice of Ising spins\nusing the Hamiltonian\nX\nH=\u2212\n\u03c3i \u03c3j\n(11)\nij\n\nfor all pairs of neighbor spins i and j. Neighbors with the\nsame spin have an initial weight of Aij = 1, neighbors with\nopposite spins have an initial weight of Bij = 1, and nonneighbors have an initial weight of Bij = 0. There is an\nunavoidable inherent discontinuity in defining the interactions for the Ising system (only neighbors can interact)\nand the continuous systems elsewhere in this paper (all\npairs of nodes interact). With this caveat, we analyze this\nIsing system according to the same multiresolution analysis, and we then compare the results to the other tested\nsystems. We apply s = 8 replicas and t = 8 trials.\nWe could effectively treat the above Ising interactions\nusing an unweighted network model since we can factor\nour the weight, but we again wish to maintain a consistent analysis across all systems in this paper. With this\nin mind, we further apply the average \"potential\" shift\n\u03c60 which varies on each defined network and which corresponds to the negative of the average weight over all pairs\nof nodes (including non-neighbors). We allow zero energy\nmoves for the solution dynamics. No overlapping nodes\nare assigned in the lattice.\n\nFig. 37. A partition of a triangular lattice with periodic\nboundary conditions. The corresponding multiresolution plot\nis seen in Fig. 36. We use the algorithm described in the paper at \u03b3 = 50 (the \"left\" plateau) to solve the system. To aid\nin visualization of the clusters, neighbor links not in the same\ncluster are made partially transparent. In this configuration,\nthere were q = 104 clusters with 17 triads, 86 \"diamonds,\"\nand 1 five-node configuration (see text) which indicates that\nthe diamond configuration dominates the partition. Our algorithm can naturally identify the different basic unit cells of\nthe lattice. By varying \u03c60 (and the corresponding \u03b3) we detect\nnatural structures on varying scales.\n\nIn Fig. 40, there are two main plateaus for \u03b3 & 100 and\na noticeable configuration \"shift\" at \u03b3 ' 100. The \"right\"\nplateau for \u03b3 & 500 consists largely of same-spin dyads\nexcept where a given spin has no matching neighbors. The\n\"middle\" plateau for 100 . \u03b3 . 500 corresponds to a\n\"natural\" grouping of medium size clusters. In Fig. 41,\ndifferent colors represent distinct clusters (best viewed in\ncolor) and edges between clusters (neighbor spins with the\nsame sign but that are in different clusters) are depicted\nin gray. Missing edges are not shown\nHere, the plateaus correspond to a cascade of structures starting from the smallest dyads of nodes, to basic\nplaquette structures (square, triangle, etc.), and growing\never larger (two joined plaquettes etc.). In Ising spin systems at different temperatures on a square lattice, the domains of \"+\" and \"\u2212\" spins are physically separated from\none another by domain walls. The plateaus here similarly\ncorrespond to the cascade of small plaquettes found on\nthe lattice up to a cutoff scale set by the domain walls.\nThe domain walls are closely related to the maximum\nin VI (NMI displays a different, non-extremal, behavior\nwhere the standard deviation is large). Physically, they\ncorrespond to the scales at which the largest fluctuations\noccur where the large fluctuations result in poor information correlations between the replicas. Fig. 42 shows\na sample depiction of the system at this VI peak. Correlation lengths are thus likely related to poorly correlated\nreplicas best indicated by a VI maximum.\n\n\f24\n\nP.

Neighbors with the same spin have an initial\nweight of Aij = 1, neighbors with opposite spins have an initial\nweight of Bij = 1, and non-neighbors have an initial weight of\nBij = 0. There are two distinct plateaus in the information\nmeasures for \u03b3 & 100 with a significant configuration shift\nnear \u03b3 ' 100. A depiction of the system at \u03b3 = 400 for the\ncenter plateau is shown in Fig. 41.\n\nparallel to the time axis are determined by the particle\nmasses. As before, extrema of the information theory correlation pinpoint the natural structures and scales in the\nsystem. In this case, there is only one tuning parameter\n\u03b3 as applied to different replicas of complete space-time\nnetworks. Thus, the space and time scales cannot be independently adjusted and are intertwined and are related\nby a ratio which is the typical speed of sound c (or an\nappropriate average of such speeds) in equilibrated solids.\n\nS Continuum elasticity about local minima\nand the shear penetration depth\nThe focus of our article is on a detailed bona fide description of amorphous materials that invokes graph theory\nmethods to ascertain general structure. The various examples shown have hopefully clearly outlined the strengths\nof our approach. In this section, we depart from this approach and outline a continuum formalism.\nContinuum elasticity in regular solids does not assume\ndetailed knowledge of the underlying atomic constituents.\nIn this section, we follow suit and outline general considerations for amorphous solids. In an ideal crystalline system,\nany small deformation about the crystalline ground state\nwill raise the energy in a harmonic manner. The increase\nof energy (for non-plastic deformations) is captured by\n\nFig. 41. A depiction of a partition of a square lattice of Ising\nspins with periodic boundary conditions at a simulation temperature of T = 2.269 (proximate to the critical temperature).\nThe corresponding multiresolution plot is seen in Fig. 40. We\nuse the algorithm described in the paper at \u03b3 = 400 (corresponding to the transition to the plateau with the highest\nNMI / lowest VI value) to solve the system. For presentation purposes, we depict all spins by spheres and links that\ncross a community boundary as grey edges. As with the multiresolution analysis of the square lattice, this multiresolution\nanalysis shows that the dominant communities are square plaquettes within same-spin domains.\n\nthe elastic constants of the material. Nothing prevents, in\nprinciple, the application of these considerations for deformation about local energy minima \u2013 as these pertain\nto an amorphous solid in a local energy minimum (an inherent structure as it would have pertained to supercooled\nliquids). In what briefly follows, we consider the harmonic\nexpansion of Eq. (12) about such a local energy minimum\nstate. We then review general considerations about \"shear\npenetration depth\"- the length scale on which the medium\nreacts to shear. Earlier treatments considered the shear\npenetration depth in homogeneous media [111, 112]. Here,\nwe consider what may occur when replicating these considerations for deformations about a general non-uniform\nlocal ground state.\nIn what follows, we label the displacement of the i-th\natom, ui about its position in a given state, Ri by\nui = r i \u2212 R i .\n\n(14)\n\nIn Eq. (14), r i denotes the location of the displaced atoms.\nHenceforth, we consider a coarse grained description in\nwhich u is a field defined in the continuum. (That is, we\nreplace the lattice indices i in Eq.(14) by continuous spatial coordinates x.) The displacement vector u is a Ddimensional vector in real space. We apply field theoretic\nideas introduced by [113]. In particular, we next follow\nthe procedure of [30, 111, 112] and write the corresponding action of the system in a manner similar to that of the\nenergy of an anisotropic solid in (D + 1) dimensions. We\nwill label the time direction as the \u03b1 = 0 direction and\ndenote all spatial Cartesian coordinates by \u03b1 = 1, 2, ..., D.\n\n\f26\n\nP. Ronhovde et al.: Detecting hidden spatial and spatio-temporal structures in glasses\n\nwith closed trajectories. Defect densities relative to a given\ninherent state may be defined in a similar way. More formally, we can dualize (via a Hubbard Stratonovich transformation) the quadratic action of Eq.(15) and associate\nthe dual fields with defect current densities in space-time.\nReplicating the analysis performed for regular solids in\n[30, 111, 112] to amorphous solids with an invertible spacetime dependent elastic moduli C\u03b1\u03b2ab , we obtain the same\nresult obtained for regular solids. Namely, dislocation and\ndisclination current densities are given by\na\nJ\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u000f\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03c1 \u2202 \u03bb \u2202 \u03c1 ua\n\u03b1\u03b2\nT\u03b3\u03b4\n= \u000f\u03b3\u03b4\u03bb\u03c1 \u2202 \u03bb \u2202 \u03c1 \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(16)\n\nwith the local rotation given by\nFig. 42. A partition of a square lattice of Ising spins with\nperiodic boundary conditions at a simulation temperature of\nT = 2.269. The corresponding multiresolution plot is seen\nin Fig. 40. We use the algorithm described in the paper at\n\u03b3 = 3.60\u00d710\u22124 , corresponding to the peak VI, to solve the system. For presentation purposes, we depict all spins by spheres\nand links that cross a community boundary as grey edges. The\nidentified clusters vary substantially across the replicas (maximum fluctuations), but they are of the scale of the size of the\nspin domains. This qualitatively implies that the poor information correlations are naturally correlated with the individual\ndomains of \"+\" and \"-\" spins. At this scale, the fluctuations\nare largest (and hence the related weakest information theory\ncorrelations). This scale on which fluctuations are maximal (coinciding with the Ising domain walls) should be contrasted with\nthat of Fig. 41 for which the fluctuations were minimal (lowest variation of information (VI)) and the normalized mutual\ninformation (NMI) was the highest.\n\nWe will use Latin indices a = 1, 2, ..., D to label the spatial directions alone. In the continuum limit, expanding\nthe energy to harmonic order about any local minima (inherent state), the action reads [111, 30],\nZ\nZ\n1\nD\nS=\nd x dt \u2202 \u03b1 ua C\u03b1\u03b2ab (x, t)\u2202 \u03b2 ub .\n(15)\n2\nIn Eq. (15), repeated indices are to be summed over. The\nquantities C\u03b1\u03b2ab derive from effective elastic moduli. In\nregular solids, C\u03b1\u03b2ab are space (and time) independent\nquantities. In an amorphous medium, however, C\u03b1\u03b2ab (x, t)\nare generally space (and time) dependent. The effective\nelastic constant C00ab in Eq. (15) is set by the mass density, i.e., C00ab = \u03c1(x, t). [30, 111, 112] When \u03b1 and \u03b2\nboth assume values between 1 and D, the quantities C\u03b1\u03b2ab\nare set by the elastic moduli of the solid (e.g., the shear\nmodulus \u03bc). The square root of the typical ratio between\nthe usual spatial elastic moduli and those along the time\naxis for the space-time representation of the solid in Eq.\n(15) is p\ngiven by a typical speed of sound in the system\nc = O( \u03bc/\u03c1).\nOne approach to defining defects such as dislocation\nand disclinations in regular solids is to consider the net\nchange in the displacement or local orientation associated\n\n\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n1\n\u000f\u03b1\u03b2\u03bba \u2202\u03bb ua .\n2\n\n(17)\n\nThe temporal direction (\u03b1 = 0) components of these tensors are the usual (dislocation and disclination) defect\ndensities of elasticity,\n\u03b1ia = \u000fijk \u2202 j \u2202 k ua\n\u0398ia =\n\n1\n\u000fijk \u000fabc \u2202 j \u2202 k \u2202b uc .\n2\n\n(18)\n\nThe condition of a divergence-less stress tensor (\u03c3) in the\nabsence of an applied force, enables us to write it as a curl\nof a gauge field,\n\u03c3\u03b1a = \u000f\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb \u2202 \u03b2 B \u03bba .\n\n(19)\n\nElastic shear is mediated by the gauge field B. When a\nplastic component of the displacement field u exists, it\ncouples minimally to the stress-gauge fields via\nZ\nSdisl = dD x dt B \u03b1a J\u03b1a\n(20)\nfor the coupling between the dislocation currents and gauges.\nMathematically, the structure is very similar to that in\nelectromagnetism when currents couples minimally to gauge\nfields. Just as charges screen applied electromagnetic fields\n(as, e.g., in the Debye screening of plasmas), defect charges\ncan screen the elastic shear. In the uniform medium, when\na defect condensate (|\u03a80 | 6= 0) appears, it gives rise a\nscreening of the elastic shear [30, 111], with a screening\nlength set by\n\u03bbshear =\n\ncT\n\u221a .\n|\u03c80 | \u03bc\n\n(21)\n\nIn Eq. (21), cT is the transverse sound velocity and \u03bc is the\nshear modulus. In the case of simple dilation of the elastic moduli when C\u03b1\u03b2ab (x, t) = w(x, t)K\u03b1\u03b2ab where K\u03b1\u03b2\nis a space-time independent tensor and w is a dilation\nfunction, the calculation of the elastic shear penetration\ndepth can be replicated for the amorphous system to yield\nEq.
