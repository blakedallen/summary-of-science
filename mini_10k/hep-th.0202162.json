Introduction and Conclusion\nEvery gauge theory coupled to massless fermions has an anomalous chiral current.\nRepresenting all fermions by left-handed Weyl fields, the Noether current associated\nwith a common global U(1) rotation is classically conserved. At the one-loop level, a\ngauge-invariant definition of the current yields the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly [1]\n\u2202\u03bc J\u03bcL =\n\ncg 2\ntr F F\u0303 .\n8\u03c0 2\n\n(1.1)\n\nFor our notation see Appendix A. The group-theoretical constant c is additive. (Each\nWeyl fermion in the fundamental representation contributes c = 21 . We will assume\nthe gauge symmetry to be non-anomalous throughout this paper.) One can also define\na conserved but gauge non-invariant current\nJ\u02c6\u03bcL = J\u03bcL \u2212 g 2 K\u03bc ,\nwhere\n\n(1.2)\n\nc\n1\n\u01eb\ntr\nA\nF\n\u2212\nA\u03bd A\u03c1 A\u03c3 .\n(1.3)\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n\u03bd\n\u03c1\u03c3\n8\u03c0 2\n3\nIf a gauge-invariant regularization is used, the gauge-invariant, non-conserved current\nJ\u03bcL is defined (up to a Z factor) by the fermion bilinear\n\u0012\n\nK\u03bc =\n\nX\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c8 iL \u03c3\u03bc \u03c8Li .\n\n(1.4)\n\ni\n\nHere i runs over all the left-handed fields. In QCD-like theories, this applies in\nparticular to dimensional regularization as well as to the standard lattice regularization [2, 3].\nWhat happens if the regulator is chiral-U(1) invariant? The U(1) current will now\nbe conserved at the one-loop level. Therefore it must, when the cutoff is removed,\ncoincide with the gauge non-invariant current J\u02c6\u03bcL defined in eq. (1.2). (This is true\nup to a term \u2202\u03bd H\u03bc\u03bd with H\u03bc\u03bd an anti-symmetric tensor.) Since, classically, the U(1)\nNoether current is gauge invariant, this can only happen because the regularization\nitself is not gauge invariant: a chiral-U(1)-invariant regularization is, necessarily, not\ngauge invariant.\nDoes this observation imply that all chiral-U(1)-invariant regularizations must\nbe dismissed? To begin with, in perturbation theory the answer is no, provided\nthe action contains covariant gauge-fixing (and ghost) terms. A covariant gauge\nwill be assumed throughout this paper. In the presence of a longitudinal kinetic\nterm, (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc )2 , the theory is renormalizable by power-counting without relying on\ngauge invariance. The renormalization program reduces to an algebraic problem and\n(provided the gauge symmetry is non-anomalous) one can restore gauge invariance to\nall orders in perturbation theory by suitable counter terms (see e.g. ref. [4]).\nBeyond perturbation theory, there is an apparent conflict between chiral U(1)\ninvariance of the regularized theory, and the fact that instanton-mediated amplitudes\nviolate the conservation of the chiral U(1) charge [5]. It has been pointed out long\n2\n\n\fago [6, 7, 8] that, in a covariant gauge, the breaking of chiral U(1) invariance can be\nspontaneous in a technical sense. The reason is that the enlarged Hilbert space of the\ngauge-fixed theory can accommodate a new Goldstone pole. The latter is unphysical\nsince it originates from the K\u03bc part of the current J\u02c6\u03bcL . If the regulator is chiral-U(1)\ninvariant there is, in fact, no other possibility. In this paper, we re-examine this question in the context of a specific lattice-regularization method. Our analysis reveals\nthat a careful definition of the thermodynamical limit is necessary, just as in the\ncase of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking. This generalizes to continuum\nregularizations with chiral U(1) invariance such as, for example, momentum-cutoff\nschemes (see e.g. ref. [9]) or the dimensional-reduction scheme of ref. [10].\nThe main motivation for our lattice-regularization method is that it may ultimately provide a non-perturbative definition of (anomaly-free) chiral gauge theories.\nThese theories are notoriously difficult to regularize in a gauge-invariant way. In particular, dimensional regularization is not a gauge-invariant regulator in this case. A\ngauge-invariant perturbative regularization for chiral gauge theories has been found\nonly recently in the context of lattice gauge theory [11, 12]. Beyond perturbation\ntheory, it is not known if non-abelian chiral gauge theories can be regularized in a\ngauge-invariant manner. (For a review of recent work in this direction see ref. [13].)\nAccording to the gauge-fixing approach, chiral gauge theories are defined as the\ncontinuum limit of a lattice theory whose action contains a covariant gauge-fixing term\nand counter terms [14, 15, 16, 17] (see also ref. [18] for a pedagogical presentation,\nand ref. [19] for a recent review on lattice chiral gauge theories). Carefully chosen\nirrelevant terms in the lattice action are essential for the existence and the continuity\nof the phase transition where the continuum limit is taken. In the abelian case, we\nshowed that the lattice fermions are indeed chirally coupled to the gauge field, and\nthat perturbation theory provides a valid description of the critical point [16].\nA fully non-perturbative generalization of the gauge-fixing approach to nonabelian theories is not a simple task, since one has to confront the issue of Gribov\ncopies. This important problem will not be addressed here (see ref. [17] for recent\nprogress). Still, the method generates a systematic expansion around the classical\nvacuum and, provided the fermion spectrum is gauge-anomaly free, it provides a consistent regularization in perturbation theory. By invoking the familiar machinery of\ncollective coordinates [5], it can be used to generate a systematic expansion around\nother classical solutions. In particular, it is possible to carry out an analytic calculation in an instanton background. This allows us to address the question, first raised\nin ref. [20], of how fermion-number violating processes are realized in the gauge-fixing\napproach.\nLet us explain the issue in more detail. The simplest chiral fermion action used\nin the gauge-fixing approach, the so-called chiral Wilson action, utilizes a set of righthanded spectator fields \u03c7iR , one per each left-handed field \u03c8Li (see Appendix C for\nthe precise definition). The role of the spectators is to avoid fermion doubling on the\nlattice [2, 3, 21]. Thanks to a fermion-shift symmetry they can be proven to decouple\nin the continuum limit [22].\nEach term in the lattice action has one \u03c8 L or \u03c7R , and one \u03c8L or \u03c7R field. The\n3\n\n\fchiral Wilson action is therefore invariant under a common U(1) rotation of all fermion\nfields. The Noether current associated with this symmetry,\nJ\u03bcL,latt \u223c\n\nX\ni\n\n(\u03c8 iL \u03c3\u03bc \u03c8Li + \u03c7iR \u03c3\u0304\u03bc \u03c7iR + * * *) ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nis exactly conserved on the lattice (the dots stand for lattice terms with no continuum\ncounterpart, see Appendix C). But since the lattice action is not gauge (nor BRST)\ninvariant in the gauge-fixing approach, the conservation of J\u03bcL,latt is consistent with our\nearlier general comments. Following ref. [23], we have verified through an explicit oneloop lattice calculation [24] that the current J\u03bcL,latt indeed reduces in the continuum\nlimit to the current J\u02c6\u03bcL defined in eq. (1.2).\nThe perturbative results of refs. [23, 24] are, however, not enough to resolve\nthe following puzzle, that we will refer to as the Banks paradox [20]. In short, the\nparadox stems from the fact that exact U(1) invariance implies exact conservation of\nthe corresponding U(1) charge, namely, of fermion number. To be precise, consider\na finite-volume lattice and assume that the boundary conditions respect the U(1)\nsymmetry. The Ward identity that corresponds to a global U(1) rotation reads\nh\u03b4Oi = q hOi = 0 .\n\n(1.6)\n\nHere q is the fermion-number, or the U(1) charge, of O. We stress that, on a finite\nlattice, this is a rigorous result. (The invariance of the lattice measure follows trivially\nfrom the fact that there is an equal number of d\u03c8L and d\u03c8 L Grassmann integrals, as\nwell as an equal number of d\u03c7R and d\u03c7R ones.)\nThe Ward identity (1.6) states that a fermion correlation function hO(x1 , x2 , . . .)i\ncan be non-zero only if q = 0, namely if the number of \u03c8L and \u03c7R fields is equal to\nthe number of \u03c8 L and \u03c7R fields. This is true for any finite lattice spacing a and any\nfinite volume, and therefore also after the continuum limit a \u2192 0 and the infinitevolume limit have been taken. Moreover, in the continuum limit the numbers of \u03c7R\nand \u03c7R fields must by themselves be equal, since the spectator field decouples [22].\nHence the numbers of \u03c8L and \u03c8 L fields must be equal too. We have thus reached the\nparadoxical conclusion that, even though the lattice-fermion spectrum is chiral [16],\nall fermion-number violating amplitudes vanish! In other words, 't Hooft vertices [5]\ndo not seem to occur. If the gauge-fixing approach would be utilized to define a\nvector-like theory such as massless QCD, the same reasoning would seem to lead\nto the erroneous conclusion that the U(1) axial charge is conserved in all physical\nprocesses.\nOne can avoid the Banks paradox by adding to the lattice action a mass term,\nmij \u03c8Li \u03c8Lj + h.c., for the physical fermions. This allows unequal numbers of \u03c8L and\n\u03c8 L fields to be compensated by insertions of the mass term. The broken, global U(1)\nWard identity in a finite (lattice) volume is now\nq hOi = 2mij\n\n*\u0012\n\nX\n\n\u03c8Li (x)\u03c8Lj (x)\n\nx\n\n4\n\n\u0013 +\n\n\u2212 h.c. O\n\n.\n\n(1.7)\n\n\fThe original lattice-fermion action corresponds to the limit m \u2192 0, where m denotes\ngenerically the magnitude of the mass terms. We see that fermion-number or axialcharge violating amplitudes can be non-zero provided they behave like m/m in the\nlimit m \u2192 0. Now, we would not expect an \"m/m\" behavior in a finite volume.\n(Being valid for m = 0, eq. (1.6) in fact implies that this is impossible in the presence\nof a lattice cutoff.) The conclusion is that, in order to reproduce correctly 't Hooft\nvertices, the infinite-volume limit and the m \u2192 0 limit must not commute. Hence,\nthe U(1) lattice symmetry must be broken spontaneously.\nAnticipating spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the U(1) lattice symmetry\nwe define the thermodynamical limit as the infinite-volume limit, followed by the limit\nm \u2192 0. In this limit the momentum-space U(1) Ward identity reads, for any p\u03bc 6= 0,\nD\n\nE\n\nip\u03bc J \u0303\u03bcL,latt (p) O = q hOi .\n\n(1.8)\n\nHere J \u0303\u03bcL,latt (p) is the Fourier transform of J\u03bcL,latt (x). Unlike eq. (1.7), because here\np\u03bc 6= 0, the explicit m-dependent term now vanishes for m \u2192 0. This is explained\nin more detail in the discussion section. The identity (1.8) holds in the regularized\ntheory as well as in the continuum limit. (On the lattice, the p\u03bc factor on the lefthand side is modified by O(ap2 ) terms. Again, remember that there is no room for\nan anomalous term since the current J\u03bcL,latt is exactly conserved on the lattice.)\nSince 't Hooft vertices do exist, this means that there are operators for which\nthe right-hand side of eq. (1.8) is non-zero. Hence the left-hand side must contain\na Goldstone pole. As explained earlier, in the continuum limit the Goldstone pole\ncomes from the K\u03bc part of the conserved U(1) current, and is unphysical [6, 7, 8].\nIn this paper we calculate instanton-sector fermion correlation functions on the\nlattice, in the semi-classical approximation. We start from a lattice-fermion action\nwith an additional, small, mass term that breaks explicitly the unphysical U(1) symmetry. Taking the infinite-volume and continuum limits, followed by the m \u2192 0 limit,\nwe show that the anticipated 't Hooft vertices are recovered. The \"m/m\" nature of\nfermion-number and axial-charge violating amplitudes is manifest in our calculation.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In order to minimize technicalities we begin\nin Sect. 2 with one-flavor QCD where, instead of the usual gauge-invariant lattice\ndefinition, we define the theory via the gauge-fixing approach in the special case that\nthe (left-handed) fermion spectrum happen to contain one field in the fundamental representation and one field in the complex conjugate one. In Sect. 3 we work\nout the anomaly-free SO(10) theory as the prototype of a truly chiral gauge theory.\nOur conclusions are summarized and discussed in Sect. 4. In particular, we show\nthat the phase of the 't Hooft vertex follows the phase of the applied mass term,\nthus demonstrating explicitly the existence of the continuously degenerate ground\nstates associated with SSB. Notations are listed in Appendix A, elements of SO(10)\ngroup theory are discussed in Appendix B, and lattice definitions are collected in\nAppendix C. The construction of propagators in the presence of approximate zero\nmodes is discussed in Appendix D.\n\n5\n\n\f2. One-flavor QCD using the gauge-fixing approach\nWe begin with the simple example of one-flavor massless QCD, an SU(N) gauge\ntheory coupled to one Dirac fermion in the fundamental representation. The anomalous current of eq. (1.1) is in this case the axial current. Let us recall what the 't Hooft\ninteraction of this theory is. In a fixed instanton background, the massless continuum Dirac operator D\n/ has one left-handed zero mode u(x) = PL u(x). Therefore the\nWeyl fields \u03c8L and \u03c8 R each have a zero mode. (In an anti-instanton background,\nthe Weyl fields with zero modes are \u03c8R and \u03c8 L .) The basic axial-symmetry violating\ncorrelation function is\nD\n\nE\n\n\u03c8L (x) \u03c8 R (y) = u(x) u\u2020(y) Det\u2032 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the expectation value denotes Grassmann integration only, and Det\u2032 is the\n(renormalized) fermion determinant with the zero mode removed. Our objective will\nbe to recover this result starting from a lattice action with exact axial U(1) invariance.\nThe remaining step in a complete semi-classical calculation is the integration over\nthe gauge and ghost fields. This raises no new conceptual issues and therefore we will\nskip the details. We recall that the integration (or lattice-sum) over the instanton\nposition recovers momentum conservation. The gaussian integration over the nonzero gauge, fermion and ghost fluctuations leads to the replacement of the lattice's\nbare instanton action, 8\u03c0 2 /g02 , by the renormalized one, 8\u03c0 2 /gr2(\u03c1), where \u03c1 is the\ninstanton's size.\nOne-flavor QCD has a gauge-invariant lattice definition. When using ordinary\nWilson fermions, the lattice fermion action is not invariant under axial transformations, and the paradox described in the introduction does not arise. (In the continuum\nlimit one reproduces the axial anomaly [3], while non-singlet axial symmetries are recovered [25].) In principle, it should be possible to define one-flavor QCD using the\ngauge-fixing approach, too. While this has many disadvantages compared to the\ngauge-invariant definition, it has the interesting property that the paradox described\nin the introduction occurs. By working out one-flavor QCD we are able to address,\nwith minimal technicalities, the main issue of this paper - how a global symmetry\nof the lattice path integral can be broken in the continuum limit.\nThe lattice construction of the chiral Wilson action begins with enumerating the\nleft-handed fields of the target theory. For one-flavor QCD we have two Weyl fields\n\u03c8L and \u03c8Lc in the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations respectively. As\nexplained in the introduction, one also needs two right-handed spectator fields that\ndecouple in the continuum limit. These may be denoted \u03c7R and \u03c7cR . In the case at\nhand, we may take advantage of the Dirac nature of the target theory, and trade the\nleft-handed anti-fundamental field with a right-handed fundamental one \u03c8Lc \u2192 \u03c8 R ,\nc\n\u03c8 L \u2192 \u03c8R . With a similar tradeoff for the corresponding spectator field, the lattice\n\n6\n\n\ffermion action density can be written in the following matrix form\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c7R \u03c8 L \u03c8 R \u03c7L\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u0011\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u02c6 \u03c3\u0304\u03bc \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \uf8eb \u03c7L\n0\n\u2212 a2 \u2737\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\u02c6 \uf8f7\nm\n\u03c3\u03bc D\u0302\u03bc \u2212 a2 \u2737\n\u03c8R\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\na\u02c6\n\u2212 2 \u2737 \u03c3\u0304\u03bc D\u0302\u03bc\nm\n0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed \u03c8L\na\n\u03c7R\n\u02c6\n\u03c3\u03bc \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u2212 2 \u2737\n0\n0\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe use hats to denote lattice derivatives. (For the precise definitions of lattice derivatives and currents see Appendix C.) Observe that the middle two-by-two block in the\nabove matrix operator resembles the massive continuum Dirac operator.\nFor orientation, we recall that in the conventional definition of Wilson fermions\nthere are of course no spectator fields, and covariant Wilson terms are placed in the\nsame block-entries as the mass terms in the above expression. This removes the\ndoublers in a gauge invariant way, while axial symmetry is lost.\nIn order to later accommodate truly chiral gauge theories, the doublers are removed here by introducing spectator fields and coupling them to the original fermions\n\u02c6 . Since the Wilson terms now couple fields with differvia the (free) lattice laplacian \u2737\nent gauge-transformation properties, they lead to breakdown of gauge invariance [26].\nIn lattice perturbation theory gauge invariance is regained by adding suitable counter\nterms, and the renormalized diagrams describe one interacting Dirac field, the quark,\nand one free Dirac field, the spectator. As is usually the case for symmetries broken\nby the lattice regularization, the above is true provided the external momenta are\nvanishingly small in lattice units. The choice of a free lattice laplacian in eq. (2.2)\nimplies the shift symmetry of the spectator field [22], which reduces considerably the\nnumber of counter terms. In particular, there are no counter terms of the form \u03c8 R \u03c7L ,\netc., and the spectator field decouples in the continuum limit.\nLet us now examine the U(1) symmetries of the action (2.2). Dropping both\nthe Wilson and the mass terms, the action would be invariant under four separate\nU(1)'s - a fermion-number symmetry for each Weyl field. With the Wilson terms\nin place, the action is still invariant under two U(1)'s. Finally, for m 6= 0, only the\ninvariance under a common U(1) rotation is left. This invariance corresponds to the\nbaryon-number symmetry of QCD.\nThe additional U(1) symmetry at m = 0 transforms \u03c7L and \u03c8R with (say) charge\n+1, and \u03c7R and \u03c8L with charge \u22121. This is the chiral symmetry that leads to the\nBanks paradox [20]. The existence of this lattice symmetry would seem to lead to\nthe (erroneous) conclusion that the axial charge is conserved in massless (one-flavor)\nQCD. As mentioned in the introduction, refs. [23, 24] already showed that the anomaly\nappears in the triangle diagram as expected. But this still does not explain how the\naxial charge is not conserved in physical processes.\nWe will now answer this question through an explicit calculation. We calculate\nthe lattice-fermion two point function in the semi-classical approximation for (small)\nm > 0. Taking the infinite-volume and continuum limits, and finally sending m \u2192 0,\nwe find that the 't Hooft interaction (2.1) is recovered.\nAs discussed in the literature [6, 7, 8], the continuous degeneracy of ground states\nassociated with SSB of the axial U(1) is parametrized by the vacuum \u03b8-angle. The\n7\n\n\fchiral Wilson action (C.1) is invariant under a CP transformation, and this remains\ntrue in the presence of the mass term introduced in eq. (2.2) above. Therefore the\ncalculation in this section (as well as in section 3) corresponds to a vacuum angle\n\u03b8 = 0. The case of general \u03b8-angle is explained in the discussion section.\nWe start with a continuum regular-gauge instanton field A\u03bc (x) whose size \u03c1 is\nvery large in lattice units, \u03c1 \u226b a. (Singular-gauge instantons are suppressed in the\ngauge-fixing approach by the irrelevant terms in the lattice action, see Appendix C.)\nThe lattice gauge field may be defined as U\u03bc (x) = exp(iaA\u03bc (x)). This is a smooth\nconfiguration. (By this we mean that U\u03bc (x) \u2212 I = O(a/\u03c1) and U\u03bc (x) \u2212 U\u03bc (x + \u03bd\u0302) =\nO((a/\u03c1)2 ).) For this lattice gauge field and fixed m > 0, we denote the matrix\noperator in eq. (2.2) by \u03b35 M. Note that according to this definition M is hermitian.\nIn the formal continuum limit, the lattice operator in eq. (2.2) goes over to a\ncontinuum Dirac operator D(m) = \u03b35 H(m) which depends on the original instanton\nfield A\u03bc (x). One obtains D(m) by dropping the (irrelevant) Wilson terms and replacing the lattice difference operators \u2202\u02c6\u03bc and D\u0302\u03bc by the corresponding continuum\nderivatives. For m > 0, D(m) describes a massive quark (made of \u03c8R,L ) whose Dirac\noperator is D+m,\n/\nand a decoupled, free massless spectator field (made of \u03c7R,L ). Thus,\nD(m) has no zero modes. We will denote by G(m) the propagator of the hermitian\noperator H(m). Both M\u22121 and G(m) admit a standard spectral decomposition.\nLet us now be more precise about how the physical matrix element is obtained.\nOne has to multiply the correlation function in eq. (2.1) by (normalized) wavefunctions f1\u2020 (x) and f2 (y) and integrate (or sum) over x and y. The physical observable\nis the gauge-field functional average of Det(M) hf1 | M\u22121 \u03b35 |f2 i. We will denote the\ngeneric virtuality of the external legs by Q2 . As explained below, the matrix element\nis dominated by instantons of size \u03c12 \u223c Q\u22122 \u226b a2 , where the last inequality follows\nbecause in the continuum limit a2 Q2 \u2192 0.\nSince the fermion determinant will be O(m), we are interested only in the O(1/m)\npiece of the propagator(s). We claim that\nsingular\nlim hf1 | M\u22121 \u03b35 |f2 isingular\nlattice = hf1 | G(m)\u03b35 |f2 icontinuum .\n\na\u21920\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere \"singular\" denotes the O(1/m) piece. The reason why eq. (2.3) is true is that\na non-zero m affects only eigenfunctions with eigenvalues \u03bb in the region |\u03bb| <\n\u223c m.\nIndeed, for all (lattice or continuum) eigenfunctions with, say, \u03bb2 \u2265 Q2 , the effect of\nm > 0 will be bounded by m2 /Q2 to some positive power. Therefore they do not\ncontribute to the O(1/m) term. For \u03bb2 \u2264 Q2 , the difference between each continuum\neigenfunction and the corresponding lattice eigenfunction is bounded by a2 Q2 to some\npositive power. Since m > 0, the inverse eigenvalues \u03bb\u22121 are bounded from above,\nand the contribution of the entire low-energy lattice spectrum approaches smoothly\nthe continuum one for a \u2192 0. (For the pairing of the lattice and the continuum\neigenfunctions we may momentarily assume a very large, but finite, volume, thus\nmaking the spectrum discrete; alternatively eq. (2.3) can also be justified directly in\nthe infinite-volume limit.)\n\n8\n\n\fIn the infinite-volume limit, the massive continuum propagator satisfies\nG(x, y; m)\u03b35 =\n\n1\nu(x)u\u2020 (y) + O(1) .\nm\n\n(2.4)\n\nHere we show explicitly only the term that diverges for m \u2192 0 (compare eq. (D.15)).\nWith the understanding that the matrix element is to be taken between smooth\nwave-functions f1,2 as described above, we thus have\nlim M\u22121 (x, y)\u03b35 =\n\na\u21920\n\n1\nu(x) u\u2020(y) + O(1) .\nm\n\n(2.5)\n\nFor the fermionic determinant similar arguments lead, after renormalization, to\nlim Det(M) = m(Det\u2032 + O(m)) .\n\n(2.6)\n\na\u21920\n\nThe explicit factor of m again comes from the (approximate) zero mode, while the\nO(m) terms account for the change in the continuous spectrum due to m. Putting\nthis together we thus obtain\nD\n\n1\nu(x) u\u2020(y) + O(1) .\n\u03c8L (x) \u03c8 R (y) = m (Det + O(m))\nm\nE\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.7)\n\nFinally, taking the limit m \u2192 0 we recover eq. (2.1). Eq. (2.7) reveals the \"m/m\"\nnature of the 't Hooft interaction.\nThe familiar eq. (2.4) above is particularly simple, and has been invoked primarily\nfor pedagogical reasons. In Appendix D we show how to handle perturbations that\nlift the zero modes, but are not proportional to the identity matrix and/or are not\nspatially constant. This more general formalism will be necessary in the next section.\nFor a few more details on the calculation of the determinant see Comment 2 in\nAppendix D.\nOur instanton calculation was done in the semi-classical approximation, as is\nroutine in the continuum. Since we have somewhat expanded its scope by using a\nspecific lattice-regularization method, we will briefly review the justification for the\nsemi-classical approximation.\nConsider a fermion-number violating amplitude with only a minimal number of\nfermions, and no other particles, as the external legs. (Here we wish to avoid the\ncontroversy about whether the fermion-number violating cross section could become\nlarge at very high energies due to multi-boson final states.) As before, denote the\ngeneric virtualities of the external legs by Q2 . For instanton size \u03c12 \u226b Q\u22122 , the overlap\nof the zero modes with the wave-functions on the external legs will provide a strong\ndamping factor. Hence the saddle point \u03c1sp of the integration over the instanton's\nsize is \u03c12sp \u223c Q\u22122 . If Q\u221a2 is much larger than the confinement scale, the running\ncoupling gr = gr (\u03c1sp \u223c Q\u22122 ) is small. This justifies the use of the one-instanton\napproximation.\nUltimately, the most visible consequence of the anomaly in one-flavor QCD is\nthat the lightest pseudo-scalar state (the \"\u03b7 \u2032 meson\") is not light compared to the\nconfinement scale (see e.g. ref. [8]). The chiral-symmetry breaking effect obtained\n9\n\n\ffrom the semi-classical instanton calculation is much smaller since it is controlled by\nthe small parameter exp(\u22128\u03c0 2 /gr2(\u03c1sp )). We resort to this deep euclidean regime,\nbecause only there are we able to apply analytic methods to accurately calculate the\nconsequences of the anomaly.\nThe above considerations have to do with the asymptotically-free nature of the\nYang-Mills coupling, and therefore they are completely independent of the regularization method. Moreover, our explicit calculation has demonstrated that no uncontrolled lattice artifacts occur. Finally, we note that the discretization of regular-gauge\ninstantons does yield gauge-field configurations that fail to satisfy the lattice YangMills equation of motion, but only by a small amount O(a/\u03c1sp). Instanton-sector\nFeynman rules that generate a systematic expansion in gr2 (\u03c1sp ) can be derived in the\npresence of an approximate classical solution, see e.g. ref. [27].\n\n3. Chiral gauge theories\nThe lesson of the previous section is that an 't Hooft vertex can be interpreted\nas an order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of the U(1) chiral symmetry in\na regularization scheme where chiral (but not gauge) invariance is preserved. The\nintroduction of a small mass term, which is sent to zero after the infinite-volume\nlimit was taken, provides the necessary coupling to an \"external magnetic field\" and\nallows the expectation value of an 't Hooft vertex to be non-zero. This reasoning is\nvalid both in the continuum and on the lattice, if one uses the gauge-fixing approach.\nThe generalization of the previous calculation to 't Hooft vertices that violate\nthe fermion-number symmetry of a chiral gauge theory is relatively straightforward.\nStarting from the lattice theory, a mass perturbation that lifts the fermionic zero\nmodes will again allow us to keep the (approximate) zero modes under control while\ntaking the infinite-volume and continuum limits. Performing next the limit m \u2192 0,\nwe will recover the 't Hooft vertices as before. The only step which may not be\nobvious, is that a mass perturbation that lifts all zero modes exists in the continuum.\nIn this section we demonstrate the existence of the necessary mass perturbation by\nworking out the example of an SO(10) chiral gauge theory. (Attempting to construct\nthe necessary mass perturbation for the most general anomaly-free chiral gauge theory\nmay be tedious, and the SO(10) example is general enough to encompass the Standard\nModel as well as the most popular Grand Unification schemes.) In a one-generation\nSO(10) theory the Weyl fermions reside in the complex 16 representation. We\nintroduce covariant derivatives (M,N = 1, . . . , 10)\nN\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + iAM\n\u03bc \u03a3M N ,\nN\nD\u0304\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + iAM\n\u03bc \u03a3\u0304M N ,\n\nin the 16 and the 16 representations respectively.\nvia\n1\ni\n[\u0393M , \u0393N ] = (1 + \u039311 )\u03a3M N +\n2\n2\n10\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe SO(10) generators are defined\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u039311 )\u03a3\u0304M N .\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fWe use the 32 by 32 representation of the ten-dimensional gamma matrices given in\nAppendix B. The (continuum) lagrangian is\nL = \u03c8 L \u03c3\u03bc D\u03bc \u03c8L .\n\n(3.3)\n\nIn an instanton background there are four left-handed zero modes, one for each\nquark or lepton. We will show that a suitable mass term lifts all four zero modes. To\nprepare for the introduction of the mass term we first rewrite the lagrangian in terms\nof Majorana-like fermions\n\uf8eb\n\nsatisfying\n\n\u03a8=\uf8ed\n\nT\n\n\u01eb C \u03c8L\n\u03c8L\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n,\n\n\u03a8=\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c8 L \u03c8LT \u01eb C\n\n\u03a8 \u2261 \u03a8T C 4 C ,\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the anti-symmetric two-dimensional tensor and C4 is the four-dimensional\ncharge conjugation matrix (see Appendix A). The 16 by 16 matrix C, which is related\nto the ten-dimensional charge-conjugation matrix, is defined in eq. (B.3). It satisfies\nC \u2217 = C T = C \u22121 = C. In terms of the Majorana-like fields the lagrangian is rewritten\nas\n1\n(3.6)\nL = \u03a8 D0 \u03a8 ,\n2\nwhere\n!\n0\n\u03c3\u03bc D\u03bc\nD0 = \u03b3\u03bc (D\u03bc PL + D\u0304\u03bc PR ) =\n.\n(3.7)\n\u03c3\u0304\u03bc D\u0304\u03bc\n0\nNote that D0\u2020 6= \u2212D0 : unlike the QCD case, D0 is not anti-hermitian. One can show\nthat\nD0\u2020 C4 C = C4 CD0\u2217 .\n(3.8)\nAppendices A and B contain a number of useful relations which have been used above.\nEquipped with the Majorana formulation we introduce a mass term\n\u0011\nm\nm\u0010 T\nT\n\u03c8L \u01eb C\u03c8L + \u03c8 L \u01eb C\u03c8 L .\n\u03a8\u03a8 =\n2\n2\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe mass term breaks explicitly the fermion-number symmetry and, in the limit\nm \u2192 0, provides the \"seed\" for spontaneous symmetry breaking. (The mass term\nalso breaks the chiral gauge invariance, see below.) The fermion operator becomes\nD(m) = D0 + m .\n\n(3.10)\n\nEq. (3.8) holds for D(m) too.\nWe will soon prove that D(m) has no zero modes, for m 6= 0. But first, we give\na simple physical explanation why this should be expected. Observe that\nC \u2297 I = \u2212i C10 \u039310 ,\n11\n\n\fwhere I is the two-by-two identity matrix. Introducing a 32-component spinor \u03a8\u2032\nwhose first 16 components are equal to \u03a8 we may write\ni\n(3.11)\n\u03a8\u03a8 \u2261 \u03a8T C4 C \u03a8 = \u2212 (\u03a8\u2032 )T C4 C10 \u039310 (1 + \u039311 )\u03a8\u2032 .\n2\nBecause of \u039310 , the mass term can be thought of as coming from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs field in the 10 representation. This vacuum expectation value\nbreaks SO(10) down to SO(9). Since all spinor representations of SO(9) are real,\nthe fermions can acquire Majorana masses consistently with SO(9) invariance. Moreover, the sixteen-dimensional representation of SO(9) is irreducible, and therefore all\nsixteen fermions acquire a Majorana mass.\nWe will now show in more detail that there are no exact zero modes for m 6= 0, and\nthat the fermion-number-violating 't Hooft interaction is recovered in the limit m \u2192 0.\nWe describe the main steps here, relegating further technical details to Appendix B.\nIn order to obtain information on the fermion propagator for m 6= 0 we will need the\ngeneral formalism of Appendix D, which applies to hermitian operators. We will thus\nconsider the following hermitian operator (and corresponding propagator)\nD(m) =\n\n0\nD(m)\nD \u2020 (m)\n0\n\n!\n\n,\n\n0\nG\u2020 (m)\nG(m)\n0\n\nG(m) =\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(3.12)\n\nNote that D(m) carries a four-component spinor index, and D(m) carries an eightcomponent spinor index. Let us first enumerate the zero modes for m = 0. There\nare the four original left-handed zero modes ui that belong to the 16 and satisfy\n\u03c3\u03bc D\u03bc ui = 0.

As explained earlier, the fermion-number symmetry is\nbroken explicitly. This is reflected by the fact that G(m) does not anti-commute with\n\u03b35 (compare eq. (3.21) below). An inspection of eqs. (3.10) and (3.12) reveals that to\nfirst order, the mass perturbation can have non-zero matrix elements only between a\n16 and a 16 zero-mode.

This, however, does not lead to any disaster; in\nfact, we know that in the UV-regulated theory the gauge symmetry is already broken by the regulator. The crucial point is that, in a covariantly gauge-fixed theory,\nthe ultra-violet behavior of the vector-boson propagator is 1/p2 for all polarizations.\nConsequently, the theory remains renormalizable even if terms that break gauge invariance are added.\nMoreover, the addition of a mass term does not change the nature of the coupling\nof the theory. The one-loop beta function is unaffected by the mass term, and so the\ntheory is still asymptotically free. Also, provided we are careful to employ a massindependent renormalization prescription, universality of the renormalized coupling\nshould be preserved. The same considerations imply that the continuum limit of the\nlattice theory should exist for m 6= 0, too. In the renormalized theory, a fermion-mass\nterm is expected to induce a vector-boson mass term, and so unitarity will be violated\nby O(m) effects. In the limit m \u2192 0 (keeping physical scales fixed) unitarity should\nbe recovered.\n\n4. Discussion\nThe classically-conserved chiral U(1) symmetry is not preserved by any gaugeinvariant regularization, and in the quantized theory physical observables exist that\nviolate this symmetry. In this paper we have considered an important aspect of\nregularization methods which are not gauge invariant but, instead, respect chiral\nU(1) invariance. Our concrete motivation to do so is the gauge-fixing approach to\n(chiral) lattice gauge theories. We showed that even with a chiral-U(1) invariant\nregulator, a careful treatment of the infra-red limit reproduces correctly the gauge\ninvariant, chiral-symmetry-violating 't Hooft vertices. In essence, our conclusions are\nas follows.\n(I) Since the chiral U(1) symmetry is preserved by the regularization but is not\nrespected by physical amplitudes, it must be broken spontaneously. (II) Therefore,\nin order to obtain the physical amplitudes, one should introduce a mass perturbation that breaks the chiral symmetry explicitly, and take the limit m \u2192 0 after the\ninfinite-volume limit. (III) The Hilbert space of the gauge-fixed theory will contain\na corresponding Goldstone pole, but it is unphysical, because it originates from an\nunphysical (gauge non-invariant) conserved current.\n14\n\n\fThe second and third statements are closely tied to the first one. When there\nis SSB the thermodynamical limit is defined by introducing an \"external magnetic\nfield\" (here the mass term) which is switched off after the infinite-volume limit has\nbeen taken. As for the existence of a massless pole, it is a consequence of locality\nand the Goldstone theorem which, in the present context, has been noted before in\nrefs. [6, 7].\nThe mass perturbation allows us to avoid the Banks paradox, namely the apparent\nconflict between the symmetries of the regularized theory and of the physical amplitudes. Starting from a gauge-fixed lattice theory that has the unwanted chiral symmetry, we have demonstrated through explicit examples how this mechanism works\nfor the anomalous axial symmetry of QCD-like theories, and for fermion-numberviolating processes in chiral gauge theories.\nZero modes belong to the low end of the fermion spectrum which, in general, is\nsensitive to infra-red details such as having m 6= 0, finite versus infinite volume, and\nchoices of boundary conditions. Keeping m > 0 provides an infra-red regularization\nfor all fermionic correlation functions, and allows us to take the infinite-volume limit\nwithout difficulty. Once in infinite volume, we obtain the correct 't Hooft vertices\nbecause we evidently have the correct number of (approximate) zero modes.\nAs explained earlier, because of CP invariance, the vacuum angle \u03b8 was equal to\nzero in the previous sections. Considering the one-flavor QCD example for simplicity,\nlet us examine a mass term with a general axial-U(1) phase. (The generalization to\nchiral gauge theories is straightforward; see ref. [28] for a discussion of \u03b8-vacua in the\ncontext of the standard Wilson action.) The lattice action is now defined by replacing\nthe mass term in eq. (2.2) with a new mass term pointing in an arbitrary axial-U(1)\ndirection (the parameter m is real)\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nm \u03c8 ei\u03b8\u03b35 \u03c8 = m ei\u03b8 \u03c8 L \u03c8R + e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03c8 R \u03c8L .\n\n(4.1)\n\nBy applying an axial-U(1) transformation (\u03c8 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8\u03b35 /2 \u03c8, \u03c7 \u2192 ei\u03b8\u03b35 /2 \u03c7, etc.), and\nusing the invariance of the lattice theory for m = 0, we can relate the value of any\n\u03b8 6= 0 correlation function to its value at \u03b8 = 0. For the correlation function of\neq. (2.1) the result is\nD\nE\nD\nE\n\u03c8L \u03c8 R = ei\u03b8 \u03c8L \u03c8 R\n.\n(4.2)\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nThe subscript \u03b8 refers to the angle of the mass term (4.1). (Note that, in eq. (4.2),\nexp(i\u03b8) may be re-expressed as exp(\u2212iq\u03b8/2) where q = \u22122 is the axial charge of\n\u03c8L \u03c8 R .)\nEq. (4.2) is a rigorous result in the lattice theory. A similar relation holds in\nthe thermodynamical limit. Hence the order parameter for axial-U(1) symmetry\nbreaking - the 't Hooft vertex - acquires a phase equal to the phase of the applied\nmass term. This proves that the SSB ground states are indeed parametrized by the\n(vacuum) \u03b8-angle.\nThe relevance of \u03b8-vacua to the U(1) problem was discussed in detail in the literature. In a continuum treatment the path integral can only be expanded perturbatively\naround selected classical fields, and \u03b8-vacua must be incorporated \"by hand.\" Here,\n15\n\n\fwe showed that the \u03b8-angle of the 't Hooft vertex arises as an unavoidable consequence\nof the lattice regularization.\nWhile our explicit lattice calculation does not depend on this, let us recall some\nrelated observations from refs. [6, 7, 8]. Any sector with a fixed topological charge,\nsuch as the one-instanton sector, is a superposition of all the \u03b8-vacua. But for any\nm 6= 0, however small, the vacuum energy density is a non-trivial function of \u03b8. This\nexplains why a unique \u03b8-vacuum is selected in the thermodynamical limit.\nHad the infinite-volume limit been taken while keeping m = 0, the \u03b8-vacua would\nhave remained exactly degenerate. This prescription would yield a vanishing result\nfor chiral-symmetry violating amplitudes. But since clustering would be violated,\nthis prescription is inconsistent. Returning to the lattice regularization, this may be\nexplained as follows. If the lattice volume is finite, V < \u221e, the limit m \u2192 0 must be\nsmooth and, hence, independent of \u03b8. Namely,\nD\n\n\u03c8L \u03c8 R\n\nE\n\nm\u21920,V <\u221e,\u03b8\n\nD\n\n= \u03c8L \u03c8 R\n\nE\n\nm\u21920,V <\u221e,\u03b8=0\n\n.\n\n(4.3)\n\nSince this must be true for all \u03b8 simultaneously with eq. (4.2), the conclusion is that\nthe 't Hooft vertex vanishes on a finite lattice, if we set m = 0. (This argument is\nreally an alternative explanation of the Ward identity (1.6), but makes the role of the\naxial phase more explicit.) An implication is that, clearly, one would have to keep\nm 6= 0 in a numerical simulation in order to recover 't Hooft vertices.\nThe 't Hooft vertices are characterized by an \"m/m\" behavior in the thermodynamical limit. Given a chiral U(1) Ward identity, should an \"m/m\" behavior be\nexpected from any other term except the symmetry-breaking expectation value? The\nanswer is no. As a concrete example consider the following momentum-space Ward\nidentity in one-flavor QCD with m 6= 0, as defined on the lattice via the gauge-fixing\napproach (Sect. 2). For |pa| \u226a 1 it reads (compare eq. (C.7))\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\nlatt\nip\u03bc J \u03035\u03bc\n(p) J5 = \u22122m J \u03035 (p) J5 + 2 \u03c8\u03c8 .\n\n(4.4)\n\nlatt\nIn this equation, J5\u03bc\nis the conserved U(1) axial current in the limit m \u2192 0, and\n\u03c8\u03c8 and J5 are the local scalar and pseudo-scalar lattice densities. As in eq. (1.8)\nthe tilde denotes Fourier transform. The expectation value of \u03c8\u03c8 corresponds to the\nlimit x = y in eq. (2.1). While in this limit the semi-classical calculation ceases to\nbe reliable,\nwe take the non-zero result for the 't Hooft vertex as an evidence that\nD\nE\n\u03c8\u03c8 6= 0.\nD\nE\nThe contribution of an approximate Goldstone pole to J \u03035 (p) J5 should be proportional to (p2 + vm)\u22121 where v is a dimensionful constant. The corresponding\ncontribution to the Ward identity goes like m/(p2D+ vm) and\nE vanishes in the limit\n \u0303\nm \u2192 0. The contribution of all other excitations to J5 (p) J5 should be less infra-red\nD\nE\nsingular. Therefore nothing that behaves like \"m/m\" should arise from J \u03035 (p) J5 , so\nlong as we are careful to keep the momentum not strictly zero. Indeed, sending p \u2192 0\nas a limit is an inherent part of the Goldstone theorem (see for example ref. [29]).\nFor m \u2192 0 we thus obtain\n\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\nlatt\nip\u03bc J5\u03bc\n(p) J5 = 2 \u03c8\u03c8 .\n\n16\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fThis equation is a special case of the Ward identity (1.8).\nThe problem of fermion-number violation in lattice chiral gauge theories was\npreviously also addressed in ref. [30]. In the (axial) Schwinger model [31], these\nauthors examined a lattice-fermion hamiltonian that has a \"superfluous\" U(1) global\nsymmetry. They monitored the response of the fermion ground state to an adiabatic\nevolution of the (abelian) gauge field that changes the topological charge of the gauge\nvacuum. They found that a U(1) charge of the anticipated amount is produced in\nthe process.\nThe clash between chiral-U(1) and gauge symmetry is at the heart of their argument. Because of the lack of exact gauge invariance at the lattice level, the initial and\nfinal bare vacua are not gauge-transforms of each other and their bare U(1) charges\nare different. During the evolution the bare charge is necessarily conserved. But since\nthe bare charge of the ground state changes in the process, there is a corresponding\nchange in the normal-ordered charge defined with respect to the ground state.\nThe introduction of m 6= 0 in our work was necessary to control the infra-red\nbehavior of a dynamical gauge-fermion system that undergoes spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of a peculiar nature. In contrast, in ref. [30] only the response of the spectrum\nof the axial Dirac operator to an external gauge field was considered, and so it was\nnot necessary to introduce the mass perturbation.\nIn conclusion, in this paper we have demonstrated convincingly that, in spite of\nthe exact chiral U(1) invariance of the lattice action in the gauge-fixing approach,\nfermion-number violating processes do occur, thus resolving the questions raised in\nref. [20].\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Pierre van Baal, Aharon Casher and Mike Creutz for\nuseful discussions.

Here \u03b1 is the spin index. The other four indices correspond to the tensor product that defines the SO(10) generators in the 16 representation. Assuming that the\ninstanton resides in e.g. the SU(2)L subgroup defined above, the zero modes have\nS3 (2) = \u22121 (equivalently \u03b22 = 2). Their SU(2)L index is \u03b21 . Using the explicit\nsolution of the isospin one-half zero mode (for a regular-gauge instanton) we have\nu\u03b1\u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 ,i (x) = N \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b21 \u03b4\u03b22 ,2 O\u03b23 \u03b24 ,i f (x2 ) ,\n19\n\n(B.7)\n\n\fwhere f (x2 ) = (x2 + \u03c12 )\u22123/2 and N is a normalization factor. The constants O\u03b23 \u03b24 ,i\ndefine the four independent zero modes. We will label them by the eigenvalues of\nS2 (3) and S3 (4). Replacing the index i = 1, . . . , 4, by a pair of indices \u03c41 , \u03c42 = 1, 2,\nwe take O\u03b23 \u03b24 ,\u03c41 \u03c42 = i(\u03c32 )\u03b23 \u03c41 (\u03c33 )\u03b24 \u03c42 . In matrix notation, O = i\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c33 , and O\nhas similar properties to the four-dimensional charge-conjugation matrix. Putting\ntogether eqs. (3.19), (B.3) and (B.7) we get\n\u03bb\u03c41 \u03c42 ,\u03c41\u2032 \u03c42\u2032 = \u2212m N 2\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\nd4 x f 2 (x2 ) tr (\u01eb2 ) OT (i\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c33 ) O\n\n= m (i\u03c32 )\u03c41 \u03c41\u2032 (\u03c33 )\u03c42 \u03c42\u2032 ,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c41 \u03c42 ,\u03c41\u2032 \u03c42\u2032\n\n(B.8)\n\nwhich proves det (\u03bb) 6= 0 for this special case. On the first row, the explicit i\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c33\ncomes from the last two factors in the tensor product (B.3), while tr \u01eb2 comes from\nthe first factor in this tensor product, and the explicit \u01eb in eq. (3.19). The transition\nfrom the first to the second row implicitly defines the normalization constant.\nSuppose now that a global rotation R \u2208 SO(10) is applied to the above special\nembedding of the instanton. The new zero modes are u\u2032i = R ui . We claim that\ndet (\u03bb(R)) 6= 0 for almost every R. The proof is simple. Suppose on the contrary\nthat det (\u03bb(R)) = 0 for every R in some open subset of SO(10). Since the embedding\nand, hence, det (\u03bb) are analytic functions of R, this would imply that det (\u03bb) = 0\nfor all R. This, however, contradicts eq. (B.8) in the special case R = I. Therefore\ndet (\u03bb) = 0 may be true, at most, on a measure zero subset of SO(10).\nAppendix C.

The local scalar and pseudoscalar lattice densities are \u03c8 x \u03c8x and Jx5 = \u03c8 x \u03b35 \u03c8x . As usual they are related by\nan axial rotation. They do not mix with the corresponding spectator-field densities\nthanks to the shift symmetry [22].\nWe now explain why singular-gauge instantons are suppressed on the lattice by\nthe gauge-fixing action of ref. [33]. Recall that, in a singular gauge, the instanton's\nvector potential near the gauge singularity (located at x = 0) is A\u03bc \u223c \u03a6(x)\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2020 (x)/g\nwhere \u03a6(x) = \u03c3\u03bc x\u03bc /|x|. The magnitude of this vector potential grows like 1/(g|x|).\nOn the lattice let us make the (bare-field) rescaling Ax,\u03bc \u2192 A\u2032x,\u03bc = g0 Ax,\u03bc . Dropping the prime, we expand the link variable as Ux,\u03bc = exp(iaAx,\u03bc ).

Here \u03be0 is the bare gauge-fixing parameter and index summations have been shown explicitly. The leading irrelevant term that contributes to the\nclassical potential is\n!\nX\nX\na2\ntr\nA2\u03bc\nA4\u03bd .\n(C.9)\n2\u03be0 g02\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\nThe irrelevant terms break BRST invariance, and so there is no reason that regulargauge and singular-gauge instantons will have the same lattice action.\nConsider now some lattice discretization of the singular-gauge vector potential.\nInevitably, the (rescaled) vector potential will be O(1/a) in the hypercube(s) containing the point x = 0 and the vicinity. For such a vector potential Ux,\u03bc \u2212 I = O(1).\nThe positivity of expression (C.9) and (since there are infinitely-many other irrelevant\nterms) of the gauge-fixing action as a whole [33], guarantees that the lattice action\nwill be an O(1) quantity times 1/g02. In the continuum limit g0 \u2192 0 any such lattice\nconfiguration is suppressed.\nD. Continuum propagators in the presence of approximate zero modes\nLet H = H0 + \u03b1V be a Schr\u00f6dinger-like (i.e. elliptic and self-adjoint) operator\nin a d-dimensional open infinite space. We assume that H0 has a finite number of\n(normalized) zero modes ui (x), and that H has no zero modes. The inverse of H,\ndenoted G, is defined by\nHG = 1 ,\n(D.1)\nwhere both sides are considered as operators acting on a suitable Hilbert space. In this\nappendix we explain how to construct a systematic approximation for G. (Eq. (D.1)\nmay be rewritten in the familiar form HG(x, y) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y) by taking the matrix\nelement of eq. (D.1) between \"position eigenstates\" hx| and |yi.)\nLet us introduce the notation |ii for the zero modes of H0 , and |pi for the rest\nof its spectrum. (In instanton problems the zero modes are the only bound states,\nand |pi denotes the continuum of scattering states.) One has H0 |pi = E(p) |pi. The\npropagator G0 is defined by\nH0 G0 = 1 \u2212 |ii hi| = |pi hp| ,\n\n(D.2)\n\nand has the spectral representation\n(G0 )pq = E \u22121 (p) \u03b4(p \u2212 q) .\n\nG0 = |pi (G0 )pq hq| ,\n\n(D.3)\n\nIt is convenient to expand G = G(\u03b1) too using the eigenmodes of H0 as a complete\northonormal basis\n\u2217\nG = |ii \u03b2ij\u22121 hj| + |pi Gpq hq| + |pi fpj hj| + |ji fpj\nhp| .\n\n(D.4)\n\nIn this expansion, the basis vectors are fixed (\u03b1-independent), while the \u03b1-dependence\nis carried by the spectral functions \u03b2ij , Gpq and fpj . Below, we show that the spectral\n22\n\n\ffunctions can be expanded as power series in \u03b1 where \u03b2ij is O(\u03b1), and Gpq and fpj\nare O(1). They will be used to construct approximations for G.\nWe start by substituting eq. (D.4) into eq. (D.1). Using H0 |ii = 0 we get\n1 = \u03b1V |ii \u03b2ij\u22121 hj| + HG\u2032 ,\n\n(D.5)\n\nwhere G\u2032 consists of the last three terms on the right-hand side of eq. (D.4). By\ntaking the matrix element between zero-mode states hi| and |ji and using hp|ii = 0\nwe get\n\u22121\n\u03b4ij = \u03b1 hi| V |ki \u03b2kj\n+ \u03b1 hi| V |qi fqj .\n(D.6)\nBy taking the matrix element between hp| and |ji we get\n\u22121\n0 = \u03b1 hp| V |ki \u03b2kj\n+ Hpq fqj ,\n\n(D.7)\n\nHpq = hp| H |qi .\n\n(D.8)\n\nwhere\nIn order to solve for \u03b2ij and fqj we have to invert Hpq . Note that Hpq is the continuousindex kernel of the operator H \u22a5 \u2261 |pi Hpq hq| which is, by definition, the projection\nof H onto the subspace orthogonal to the zero modes of H0 . The inverse of the\nprojected operator is defined by H \u22a5 (H \u22a5 )\u22121 = |pi hp|. The corresponding kernel\n\u22121\nsatisfies (H \u22a5 )\u22121 \u2261 |pi Hpq\nhq|. One has\nhp| H |qi = hp| H0 |qi + O(\u03b1) = E(p) \u03b4(p \u2212 q) + O(\u03b1) .\n\n(D.9)\n\nTherefore (H \u22a5 )\u22121 exists, and (compare eq. (D.3))\n\u22121\nHpq\n= E \u22121 (p) \u03b4(p \u2212 q) + O(\u03b1) .\n\n(D.10)\n\n\u22121\nWe are now ready to solve for \u03b2ij and fqj . Multiplying eq. (D.7) by Hpq\nwe get\n\u22121\n\u22121\nfqj = \u2212\u03b1Hqp\nhp| V |ki \u03b2kj\n,\n\n(D.11)\n\nand substituting this in eq. (D.6) we get\nD\n\n\u03b2ij = i\n\n\u0010\n\n\u22121\n\u03b1V \u2212 \u03b12 V |qi Hqp\nhp| V\n\n\u0011\n\nE\n\nj .\n\n(D.12)\n\n\u22121\nEq. (D.10) implies that Hqp\n= O(1), hence \u03b2ij = O(\u03b1) and fqj = O(1).\nThe parametric \u03b1-dependence of the last spectral function is determined to be\nGpq = O(1). To show this, take the matrix element of eq. (D.5) between scattering\nstates hp| and |qi, which gives\n\u2217\n.\n\u03b4(p \u2212 q) = Hpp\u2032 Gp\u2032q + \u03b1 hp| V |ki fqk\n\n(D.13)\n\nSince we already know that fqj = O(1), the last term on the right-hand side is sub\u22121\nleading. It follows that Gpq = Hpq\n+ O(\u03b1) = (G0 )pq + O(\u03b1). Moreover, by combining\nthese results it follows that the spectral functions can be expanded as power series\n23\n\n\fin \u03b1, starting at the above-specified order for each spectral function. (See, however,\nComment 1 below.)\nThe propagator G involves \u03b2ij\u22121 , and so it has a Laurent series starting at order\n1/\u03b1. To find the singular, O(1/\u03b1) piece of the propagator, we keep only the O(\u03b1)\nterm on the right-hand side of eq. (D.12). We get \u03b2ij = \u03bbij,1 + O(\u03b12), where\n\u03bbij,1 = \u03b1 hi| V |ji .\n\n(D.14)\n\nThis expression is recognized as the first-order energy shifts of the zero modes, as\ncalculated using degenerate perturbation theory. Substituting in eq. (D.4) we obtain\nG = |ii \u03bb\u22121\nij,1 hj| + O(1) .\n\n(D.15)\n\nWhile eq. (D.15) is all we will be using in the body of the paper, it is instructive\nto go one step further and construct also the O(1) part of the propagator. To this\n\u22121\nend we approximate Hpq\nby (G0 )pq . Eq. (D.12) then yields \u03b2ij = \u03bbij,2 + O(\u03b13 ) where\n\u03bbij,2 = hi| \u03b1 V \u2212 \u03b12 V G0 V |ji ,\n\n(D.16)\n\nwhich, as expected, includes also the second-order energy shifts. Next, making a\nsimilar approximation in eq. (D.11) we have\n|pi fpj hj| = \u2212\u03b1 G0 V |ii \u03bb\u22121\nij,1 hj| + O(\u03b1) .\n\n(D.17)\n\nThis involves the first-order correction to the zero mode's wave function. Putting\neverything together we find that, at O(1), the propagator may be compactly expressed\nas\nG = |i, 1i \u03bb\u22121\n(D.18)\nij,2 hj, 1| + G0 + O(\u03b1) ,\nwhere\n\n|i, 1i = (1 \u2212 \u03b1G0 V ) |ii .\n\n(D.19)\n\nWe conclude this appendix with two technical comments.\nComment 1. Perturbation theory is a-priori not valid, if the perturbation \u03b1V results\nin the disappearance of any bound states from the spectrum. What we have done\namounts to showing that perturbation theory can still be used to construct an O(\u03b1n )\napproximation for the propagator, provided that the integrals occurring at (n + 1)th order in perturbation theory converge. As already mentioned, in this paper we\nactually use only eq. (D.15). In four dimensions fermionic zero modes fall like |x|\u22123\nor faster for |x| \u2192 \u221e. Even if we perturb by a spatially constant mass term m (that\ndoes not vanish at infinity) eq. (D.15) gives the correct expression for the O(1/m)\npart of the propagator.\nComment 2. In a semi-classical calculation we also have to separate out the approximate zero modes' contribution to the determinant. As discussed in detail in ref. [27],\nthis can be done by splitting the functional integration into separate integrations\nover the amplitudes of the (approximate) zero modes, and over the orthogonal subspace. To leading order, the integration over the zero modes' subspace gives rise to\n24\n\n\fdet (\u03bb1 ) (see eq. (D.14) above). The integration over the orthogonal subspace has a\nnon-vanishing finite limit (after subtracting UV divergences).\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Adler, Phys. Rev. 177 (1964) 2426; J. Bell and R.
