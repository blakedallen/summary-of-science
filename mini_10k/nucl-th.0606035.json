A prominent\nexample for this is quantum optics or laser physics in\ngeneral [1, 2, 3], for instance related to light-matter interactions on the level of single quantum objects [4, 5].\nSimilar control is also possible at lower driving field frequencies, e.g., with NMR techniques in the microwave\nfrequency region [6]. Towards higher frequencies, in particular the development and deployment of high-intensity\nlasers have opened the doors to new fascinating areas of\nphysics of light-matter interactions. Laser fields reach\nand succeed the Coulomb field strength experienced by\nthe electrons due to the nucleus and thus give rise to a\nplethora of exciting phenomena [7, 8, 9].\nThe above examples have in common that they focus\non the interaction of the driving fields with the outer\nelectron shell of the atoms. Regarding the interaction\nof strong laser fields with nuclei, however, mostly indirect reactions have been studied so far. In these reactions, electrons or plasmas are encountered by a laser\npulse and then, directly or by creating radiation, react\nwith the nucleus. Typical examples are the production\nof MeV X-rays in a plasma that is generated by femtosecond laser pulses [10], the study of \u03b3-induced nuclear reactions in plasma radiated by a super-intense laser [11, 12],\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: buervenich@fias.uni-frankfurt.de\naddress: joerg.evers@mpi-hd.mpg.de\n\u2021 Electronic address: keitel@mpi-hd.mpg.de\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nor neutron production in laser plasma [13, 14]. Also, the\ncoupling of nuclear and electronic transitions has been\nconsidered [15]. Applications are lasing [16], the control\nof M\u00f6ssbauer spectra [17, 18], or inversionless amplification [19]. Further applications include optically induced\nnuclear fission [20] and fusion [21, 22], nuclear reactions,\nisomer excitations [23], or nuclear collisions [24].\nIn contrast, direct laser-nucleus interactions do not involve intermediating particles such as electrons or gamma\nray photons. So far, however, such direct interactions\nhave mostly been dismissed because of small interaction\nmatrix elements [25]. Rare exceptions study direct laserand x-ray-nucleus interactions in the context of \u03b2 decay [26] or x-ray-driven gamma emission of nuclei [27].\nOn the other hand, effects such as laser-induced pair creation which previously had been neglected for the same\nreason of small interaction matrix elements, are now being studied, see for example [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].\nThe reason is that it can be expected that present and\nupcoming technology will allow to enter regimes where\nthese traditionally neglected processes become possible.\nIn [35], we have shown that direct laser-nucleus interactions may indeed become of relevance in future experiments employing x-ray lasers, opening the field of nuclear quantum optics. In particular, the coherence of the\nlaser light expected from new sources such as TESLA\nXFEL [36] is the essential feature which may allow to access extended coherence or interference phenomena reminiscent of atomic quantum optics. Such laser facilities,\nespecially in conjunction with moderate acceleration of\nthe target nuclei to match photon and transition frequency, may thus enable one to achieve nuclear Rabi\noscillations, photon echoes or more advanced quantum\noptical schemes [1] in nuclei.\nThis in principle may allow for a considerable range of\n\n\f2\napplications: As ultimate goal, one may hope that strong\nlaser fields could be utilized as tools for preparation, control and detection methods in nuclear physics. Possible\napplications could be the control of the reaction channels\nin laser-nucleus interactions, i.e., switch between pair creation, nuclear excitation, fragmentation, fission or other\nprocesses. Furthermore, and based on the experience of\nhigh-precision laser spectroscopy for atomic and molecular systems, lasers might be employed to measure highresolution spectra especially of low-lying nuclear states,\nas well as nuclear properties such as energies, lifetimes,\nand transition moments. Laser-assisted preparation of\nnuclear states may also serve to find new effects or reaction channels in nuclear reactions. In addition, some\nobservables may allow to measure properties of nuclei\nsuch as transition dipole moments and transition energies independent of nuclear models [35].\nFrom a comparison with atomic physics, it appears obvious that a near-resonant driving of nuclear transitions\nas studied in [35] is the most promising approach to lasernucleus interactions. The large transition frequencies in\nnuclei, however, make this challenging, and require highfrequency laser facilities, possibly assisted by an acceleration of the target nuclei. Such coherent high-frequency\nlight sources, however, are rare as compared to corresponding light sources at optical frequencies. Thus the\nquestion arises, whether direct laser-nucleus interactions\nare also possible and of relevance with super-intense laser\nfields in the optical frequency region, far off resonance\nwith the considered nuclear transitions. The obvious advantage of this approach is a relaxation of the demands\non the facilitated laser source with respect to frequency.\nTherefore, in this study, we investigate AC-Stark shifts\nof single-particle proton states in the presence of offresonant super-intense laser fields. We find that these\nshifts may serve as a signature of direct laser-nucleus interactions. In the lab frame, the considered laser fields\nare in the optical frequency region (O(1 eV)). Head-on\ncollisions of the laser field with accelerated nuclei allow\nto increase the frequency and the intensity of the photons in the rest frame of the nuclei. The required nuclear\nproperties are calculated with the help of a relativistic\nmean-field model. Relativistic mean-field models, and\nmore generally self-consistent mean-field models, provide\na wealth of information on the nuclear ground state in\na converged calculation, such as the binding energy, the\nproton, neutron, and charge density, as well as all singleparticle wave-functions. The latter are of most relevance\nfor the present study.\nWe find that with the help of a moderate acceleration\nof the target nuclei, present and near-future super-intense\nlaser fields may induce AC-Stark shifts which relative to\nthe respective transition frequencies are of similar order\nas found in typical quantum optical setups. Our primary observable, the AC-Stark shift, is closely related to\nwork in atomic physics in order to facilitate a comparison of these two branches. It should be noted, however,\nthat while the nuclear AC-Stark shift is closely related to\n\nthe atomic counterpart, there are some interesting differences, which may allow for physical processes exclusively available in nuclei. These differences will briefly\nbe discussed in the final part. As a first step in this direction, we further study proton root-mean-square (rms)\nradii and proton densities under influence of off-resonant\nsuper-intense laser fields as typical observables in nuclear\nphysics.\nThe article is structured as follows: In Sec. II, we\ndescribe the laser-nucleus interaction employed in this\nstudy as well as the nuclear model that is used to calculate the single-particle wave-functions. We discuss the\ncomputational procedure and present possible observables. Section III presents the numerical results of the\nAC-Stark shift calculations and discusses their implications. We also relate them to the atomic case. Section IV\ndiscusses and summarizes the results.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\nA.\n\nLaser-nucleus interaction\n\nWe treat the laser-nucleus interaction in the electric\ndipole approximation, in which the (non-relativistic) interaction term in the length gauge is given by [3, 37]\n~ * ~r .\nHI = \u2212eE(t)\n\n(2.1)\n\n~\nHere, e = |e| is the electron charge, E(t)\nis the electric\nfield, and ~r the position operator. For light linearly polarized in z-direction, this reduces to HI = \u2212eE(t)z. The\ntotal Hamiltonian of our system is thus\nH = H 0 + HI ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere H0 denotes the nuclear Hamilton operator that is\nspecified by the nuclear model employed and will be described in Section II C. A few comments on the choice\nof this interaction are in order. The spatial dependence\nof the electric laser field is neglected in the dipole approximation due to the small extension of the nucleus of\nthe order of a few Fermi. The magnetic fields can be neglected due to the smallness of the laser-nucleus interaction. Here we have an important difference to atomic systems: Intensities considered large on atomic scales (they\ncompete with the Coulomb force of the nucleus), typically\nare still weak as compared to the much stronger force\nbetween nucleons. Thus a non-relativistic treatment is\njustified in our case. The nuclear model employed in\nthis study provides a covariant framework for the nuclear\nground-state description. Note, however, that the nucleons within the nucleus move non-relativistically. The\npredominant relativistic feature is the strong spin-orbit\nforce in nuclei, which is an intrinsic ingredient in a covariant description employing strong scalar and vector\nfields.\n\n\f3\nIn axial symmetry, the proton single-particle wavefunctions can be written as [38]\n\u03c8i (z, \u03c1, \u03c6) = \u03c8i\u03b7\u03c3 (z, \u03c1, \u03c6)\n\u0002\n\uf8eb ++\n\u03c6\u03b7i mi \u03c0i (z, \u03c1) exp i(mi \u2212\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03c6+\u2212 (z, \u03c1) exp \u0002i(m +\ni\n\uf8ec \u03b7i mi \u03c0i\n=\uf8ec\n\u0002\n\uf8ec \u2212+\n\uf8ec \u03c6\u03b7i mi \u03c0i (z, \u03c1) exp i(mi \u2212\n\uf8ed\n\u0002\n\u03c6\u2212\u2212\n\u03b7i mi \u03c0i (z, \u03c1) exp i(mi +\n\n\u0003\uf8f6\n\n1\n2 )\u03c6\n\n\u0003\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u0003\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n1\n\uf8f7\n2 )\u03c6 \uf8f8\n\u0003\n1\n2 )\u03c6\n1\n2 )\u03c6\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere ni , mi , \u03c0i are radial quantum number, the projection of the total angular momentum on the symmetry\n(z\u2212) axis, and the parity.

Note that \u2206E arises as a second-order perturbation effect since the single-particle wave-functions have\ngood parity (this is also true in the atomic case). As discussed in [39], the quantum-mechanical calculation yields\nthe same result in the limit of large photon number,\nwhich applies to our study.\nIn the limit ~\u03bd \u226a \u2206\u01eb = \u01ebn \u2212\u01ebm , i.e., for laser field photon energies well below the nuclear transition frequencies,\nthe laser-frequency dependence in the denominator drops\nout, leaving us with\n\u2206En\u226a =\n\n1 X hn|HI |mihm|HI |ni\n.\n2\n\u01ebn \u2212 \u01ebm\n\n(2.7)\n\nm6=n\n\nThe same expression is obtained in a time-averaged calculation in the adiabatic limit [41].

Note that this definition also holds for non-spherical\ndensity distributions. The rms radius is related to the\nspatial extension of the density distribution. The experimentally accessible quantity in nuclei is the nuclear\ncharge radius which can be extracted from the corresponding measured form factor.\nThe spherical quadrupole moment in axial symmetry\nreads [42]\nr\nZ\n1\n5\nQ20 =\nd3 x\u03c1p (~x)(2z 2 \u2212 r2 ) ,\n(2.15)\n2 4\u03c0\np\nwhere r = x2 + y 2 .

Though we have no guaranty that these wavefunctions yield a close approximation to nature, the success of the RMF approach supports our choice [44, 45].\nMoreover, these wave functions do not suffer from known\ndeficiencies of other approaches, e.g., the wrong asymptotics of wave functions obtained in a harmonic oscillator\npotential.\nThe RMF model [44, 46, 47, 48] has historically been\ndesigned as a renormalizable meson-field theory for nuclear matter and finite nuclei. The realization of nonlinear self-interactions of the scalar meson led to a quantitative description of nuclear ground states. As a selfconsistent mean-field model (for a comprehensive review\nsee [46]), its ansatz is a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian that\nincorporates the effective, in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction. In contrast to macroscopic-microscopic approaches, no assumptions on the nuclear potential or density are made. RMF models yield the binding energy and\nall single-particle wave-functions in one calculation, from\nwhich several other kinds of observables can be obtained.\nRecently, self-consistent models have undergone a reinterpretation [45] which explains their quantitative success\nin view of the facts that nucleons are composite objects\nand that the mesons employed in RMF have only a lose\ncorrespondence to the physical meson spectrum [49] They\nare seen as covariant Kohn-Sham schemes [53] and as approximations to the true functional of the nuclear ground\nstate. According to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, the\nexact ground-state functional does exist. However, this\ntheorem does not provide a handle to construct it (it is\nnon-constructive). As a Kohn-Sham scheme, the RMF\nmodel can incorporate certain ground-state correlations\nand yields a ground-state description beyond the literal\nmean-field picture. RMF models are effective field theories for nuclei below an energy scale of \u039b \u2248 1 GeV, separating the long- and intermediate-range nuclear physics\nfrom short-distance physics, involving, i.e., short-range\ncorrelations, nucleon form factors, vacuum polarization\netc, which is absorbed into the various terms and coupling constants.\nThe strong attractive scalar (S \u2248 \u2212400 MeV) and repulsive vector (V \u2248 +350 MeV) fields provide both the\nbinding mechanism (S + V \u2248 \u221250 MeV) and the strong\nspin-orbit force (S \u2212 V \u2248 \u2212750 MeV) of both right sign\nand magnitude.\nThe RMF model is based on phenomenology and needs\nan adjustment of its (phenomenologically introduced)\n\n\f5\ncoupling constants [43]. We have chosen the parameterization NL3 [54], which is among the most successful\nparameterizations available.\n\nD.\n\nComputational procedure\n\nThe stationary mean-field equations are solved with a\nC++ code on a grid in coordinate space in axial symmetry.\nThe wave functions are written out and then processed\nto compute the dipole matrix elements ha|z|bi between\nrespective proton states a and b. Matrix manipulations\nand integrations are done using Python together with\nthe modules NumArray [55] and SciPy [56]. We have\nneglected pairing in our mean-field calculation to be consistent with the following computation of the matrix elements and the Stark shifts. While pairing is important\nfor a highly accurate description of ground-state energy\nand deformation, it is not relevant for our purpose.\nUncertainties in the calculations of the dipole matrix\nelements stem from the calculated radial components of\nthe wave functions. Still, mean-field wave-functions can\nbe considered realistic for nuclei close to the valley of stability and for well-bound states, which we consider here.\nThus we will not reach the accuracy reached in QED\ncalculations, but we still can expect solid quantitative\npredictions of the AC Stark shifts. This justifies further\napproximations that introduce uncertainties within this\nframework. We have neglected the influence of the center of mass motion of the nucleus and the (very weak)\ncoupling of the neutrons to the laser, thus no effective\ncharges were introduced in our calculations. Furthermore, all effects beyond the electric dipole approximation, which are related to the magnetic field contributions\nof the laser field have been omitted. In this respect, one\nshould note that it is not the laser field intensity itself,\nbut rather the effective coupling HI relative to the meanfield Hamiltonian H0 which determines whether the electromagnetic field induces large perturbation on the nuclear ground state or not. Thus approximations are valid\nin the nuclear case for intensities where the same approximations break down for the calculations of atomic\nor molecular systems.\nIn this work we assume that a spheroidal nucleus will\nhave its symmetry axis aligned with the direction of the\nlaser field. This way, the interaction with the laser field\ndoes not destroy axial symmetry of the system which\nwe employ in our numerical solution of the mean-field\nequations. Since most spheroidal nuclei possess no static\ndipole moment, this alignment will not take place naturally. However, alignment can take place under the\nfollowing conditions: a) the nucleus has a reflectionasymmetric ground-state shape and thus a static electric\ndipole moment (there are rare cases) [57]; b) we employ\nan additional electric field gradient in the polarization\ndirection of the laser field. The interaction with the\nquadrupole moment of the nucleus then leads to alignment since the interaction energy of the quadrupole mo-\n\nment with\u0010 the \u0011external static electric field is given by\nz\nW = \u2212 41 \u2202E\n\u2202z eQz assuming that the electric field is\npointing in z direction. Without such an alignment, the\nnucleus exposed to the laser field will experience shape\nchanges that lead to triaxial shapes and the dipole matrix elements will slightly differ. The size of the Stark\nshifts, however, will be similar to the ones calculated in\nthe aligned case.\n\nE.\n\nLaser-Nucleus collisions\n\nBoth laser frequency and intensity in the nuclear rest\nframe can be effectively increased by letting the nucleus\nand laser collide head-on. In the rest frame of the nucleus,\nthe Doppler shifted electric field strength EN and the\nfrequency \u03bdN are given by\n\nEN =\n\ns\n\n1+\u03b2\nEL = (1 + \u03b2)\u03b3EL ,\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\n(2.17)\n\n\u03bdN =\n\ns\n\n1+\u03b2\n\u03bdL = (1 + \u03b2)\u03b3\u03bdL ,\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere subscript N denotes the nuclear rest frame and L\nthe laboratory frame, respectively.\nFor \u03b3 factors of about 1000 (4000), on has \u03b2 \u2248 1 (1),\nand we obtain (1 + \u03b2)\u03b3 \u2248 2000 (8000). Since the laser\nintensity is proportional to E 2 , we find amplification\nby a factor of 4.0 \u00d7 106 (6.4 \u00d7 107 ). Assuming lab2\nframe intensities of IL \u2248 1022\u221224 W/cm , we can reach\n2\nIN \u2248 1028\u221231 W/cm2 . Intensities of IL \u2248 1028 W/cm\nare in reach in the near future, and the higher the laser\nintensity, the smaller is the necessary \u03b3 factor of the accelerated nuclei. As will be shown below, in order to\nreach AC Stark shifts comparable to typical shifts in\natomic systems with respect to the transition frequencies,\nonly moderate \u03b3 shifts are necessary. For these cases of\n\u03b3 \u2248 1000\u22124000, employing optical lasers with E \u2248 1 eV,\nphoton energies of about 2 \u2212 10 keV result, which is still\nsmaller than typical energy differences of proton singleparticles energies of a few MeV (deeply bound states)\nor some hundreds of keV (near the Fermi edge). Choosing IR-lasers in the first place yields even smaller photon\nenergies.\nIn the following, we discuss frequencies and intensities\nin the nuclear rest frame. Note that it is not important whether the assumed values are reached via a large\nvelocity as compared to the lab frame, a powerful laser\nfacility, or a combination of both. Both high-intensity\nlaser as well as ion accelerators are available today or\nin the near future, albeit mostly in separate places. A\npromising ansatz to reach experimental conditions as required for the physics discussed here would be to install\nand combine both types of facilities in one laboratory.\n\n\f6\n\n5\n\n| E| (keV)\n\n104\n103\n102\n10\n10\n1\n-1\n10-2\n10 -3\n10-4\n10-5\n10-6\n10-7\n10-8\n10-9\n10-10\n10\n\n16\n\n168\n\nO\n5.55\n\n2.614\n\n240\n\nEr\n\nPu\n\n6.05\n\n5.5\n\np\n\nrrms (fm)\n\n6.0\n2.612\n\n5.45\n\n2.61\n\n5.4\n\n5.95\n\n5.35\n\n5.9\n\n2.608\n5.3\n2.606\n\n5.85\n\n5.25\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n2\n\nlog[I (W/cm )]\n\n34\n\n36\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n2\n\nlog[I (W/cm )]\n\n34\n\n36\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n2\n\nlog[I (W/cm )]\n\nFIG. 1: AC-Stark shifts of the proton single-particle states in the laser field (upper row) as a function of laser intensity in the\nnuclear rest frame for the nuclei as indicated, and proton rms radii (lower row) as a function of laser intensity in the nuclear\nrest frame. Each line in the upper figures corresponds to a Stark shift of a proton single-particle level. The widths of these\nbands characterize the spread in these shifts. In the lower figure, the square dots indicate the calculated results, which for\nconvenience are connected by the thin line.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 1 shows the AC Stark shifts of single proton\nstates in the nuclei 16 O, 168 Er, and 240 Pu, as well as the\ncorresponding rms proton radii. We have chosen these\nnuclei as typical representatives of light, intermediate,\nand heavy nuclei. Their lowest measured E1 excitations\nlie at 7.117 MeV (16 O), 1.359 MeV (168 Er), and 0.555\nMeV (240 Pu), respectively [58]. Thus, transitions will not\nbe excited by the considered laser energies of O(keV) in\nthe nuclear rest frame. Lower excitations of even parity would require two- or higher-order photon processes,\nand their energies are still more than 20 keV above the\nground state energy. Hence we can treat the Stark effect\nseparately from nuclear excitation mechanisms.\nShifts of \u2248 1 keV are reached at intensities of roughly\n1034 W/cm2 for oxygen, and 1032 W/cm2 for the heavier\nsystems. As discussed above, these shifts are approximately a factor of 10-1000 smaller than typical energy differences of single-particle levels close to the Fermi edge.\nAs expected, in absolute terms, they are much larger\nthan shifts appearing in atomic systems, but may also\nsurpass them in relative terms, see the end of this section for details. The size of the shifts depends both on\n\nthe matrix elements hm|HI |ni as well as on the number of states contributing with dipole moments and their\ncorresponding single-particle energies. Since oxygen has\nonly 8 protons, the effects are rather small. There are no\nsignificant changes in the proton rms radius. The Stark\nshifts in 168 Er, and 240 Pu are (on the average) larger than\nin oxygen due to the increased number of states. Also,\nchanges in the proton radii set in above I = 1033 W/cm2 .\nFor the medium and heavy nuclei under consideration,\nshape changes of the nucleus (as reflected in the increasing rms radii) also lead to an increase of the quadrupole\nmoment of these systems, see Section II B 2, changing the\nmoments of inertia. This will in turn alter the rotational\nexcited states of these systems.\nFigure 2 displays the proton density for laser intensities of I = 1025 W/cm2 (left) and I = 1035 W/cm2\n(right). At 1025 W/cm2 , the density profile resembles\nthe ground-state density, no differences are visible. This\nis due to the fact that Stark shifts and, correspondingly,\nchanges of the single-particle wave-functions are small.\nAt the higher intensity, Stark shifts reach values of a few\nhundred keV. This is certainly the limit of our adiabaticity assumption. The proton density is slightly extended\nin z- and r-directions.

This might\nbe related to the fact that the dipole matrix elements\nyield largest contributions for states close to the Fermi\nedge, where high total angular momentum projections\non the z-axis occur. These states are localized at large\nz-values and thus lead to the visible enhancement. This\nrearrangement of the nucleus leads to an increase of the\nquadrupole moment, see Eq. (2.15). Significant changes\nin this observable correspond to the respective changes\nin the rms radii that are shown in Fig. 1.\nWe would like to classify the various processes taking place for a nucleus in a super-intense laser-field according to the nuclear rest-frame laser intensity (see\nRef. [7, 8, 9, 59] for a discussion of effects relevant to\nlaser-nucleus physics). The following hierarchy of effects\ncan be constructed, going from low to high laser intensities in the nuclear rest frame:\n- I < 1029 W/cm2 : a) radiation from scattering off of\nthe nucleus in the laser field; b) radiation from electrons\nsurrounding the nucleus if the ion is not fully stripped; c)\nthe AC Stark shifts are already comparable to the typical atomic shifts in relation to the transitional energies\nof single-particle states\n- I \u2248 1029 W/cm2 : This is the critical field strength [60,\n61, 62] at which e+ e\u2212 pair creation sets in [33, 34, 63],\nadditionally radiation is generated by created electrons\nor positrons that oscillate for a few cycles within the laser\nfield\n- I \u2265 1032 W/cm2 : Direct laser-nuclear interactions become non-negligible, AC Stark shifts of proton states\nlead to a slight structural change of the nucleus, weak\nquadrupole oscillations take place in the laser field; very\nweak quadrupole radiation sets in.\n\nWe can compare the nuclear AC Stark effects with\nsimilar situations for atomic systems. In typical nonresonant laser-atom systems which aim at measuring the\nAC Stark shifts in moderate laser fields, the relation of\nthe energy shifts due to the laser fields compared to typical energy differences of O(eV) is \u2248 10\u221212 \u221210\u221210 [64, 65].\nIn the nuclear case with energy differences of O(MeV),\nthis would correspond to AC Stark shifts of the order of 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22127 keV, as found in the low intensity regime of Fig. 1. The corresponding intensities of\nI = 1025 \u2212 1027 W/cm2 are close to intensities that can\nbe presently reached or are envisaged in the near future.\nThus, nuclear AC Stark shifts that are similarly related\nto the typical transition energies as in the atomic case can\nin the future be expected even without a pre-acceleration\nof the nuclei. It remains to be seen if these Stark shifts\ncan be directly measured. Such kind of measurements,\nhowever, would demonstrate the direct laser-nucleus interactions in a very concise way. We would like to point\nout that the framework of our Stark-shift calculations is\nbased on continuous wave lasers, while in most realistic\nsituations (laser-nucleus collisions, or super-intense lasers\nincident on a fixed target) laser pulses will be employed.\nThere, the calculated Stark shift sizes correspond to the\ncentral region of the laser pulse.\nIn addition to the structural changes, due to the incident field, the nucleus will also experience an oscillating center-of-mass motion, resulting in dipole radiation\nperpendicular to the direction of the laser electric field\nand the beam axis (we do not consider the drift motion\nin beam direction, consistent with the non-relativistic\ntreatment of the light-matter interaction as discussed in\nSecs. II A and II D). The oscillation extent \u2206xpol , which\nis twice the amplitude of oscillation in polarization di-\n\n\f8\nrection, can be calculated classically for a structureless\nparticle of charge q [66] in an electromagnetic field, yield2\ning \u2206xpol = (2|q|EN )/(m\u03c9N\n). We estimate \u2206xpol for\n168\nthe nucleus\nEr, using |q| = 68 e, m \u2248 168 u, for\nEN = 1.0 \u00d7 1016 V/cm. As photon energies, we choose\n~\u03c9 = 1 eV and ~\u03c9 = 1 keV, respectively. The resulting\noscillation extent is \u2206xpol \u2248 3 * 1010 fm for ~\u03c9 = 1eV\nand \u2206xpol \u2248 3 * 104 fm for ~\u03c9 = 1 keV. This should be\ncompared to the size of the nucleus, which is on the order\nof 6 fm. Note also that here the nucleus is assumed to\nbe free of electrons, which increases the charge-to-mass\nratio as compared to the case of a singly charged ionic\ncore after a single electron ionization. This enhances the\nresponse of the nucleus to the incident field. The dipoletype nuclear center of mass motion yields radiation, with\ntotal radiation power given classically by [67]\nP =\n\nc2 Z 0 k 4 2\n|~\np| ,\n12\u03c0\n\n(3.1)\n\np\nwhere Z0R = \u03bc0 /\u01eb0 is the impedance of the vacuum,\nand p~ = ~r\u03c1p (~r)d3 r is the dipole moment, respectively.\nAssuming this radiation to be emitted by photons of energy E = ~\u03c9, we can semi-classically estimate the time\nneeded for the emission of one photon by\nP =\n\nW\n~\u03c9\n=\nt\nt\n\n\u21d4\n\nt=\n\n~\u03c9\n.\nP\n\n(3.2)\n\nIf we equate \u2206xpol with the length entering the dipole\nmoment, for 168 Er we obtain |~\np| = 68 e \u00d7 \u2206xpol . For\nphoton energies of ~\u03c9 = 1 eV we estimate tN = 2 \u00d7\n10\u221221 s, for ~\u03c9 = 1 keV we obtain tN = 2 \u00d7 10\u221218 s.\nThese emission times have to be compared to typical\nlaser pulse durations of 1-100 fs, which is the duration\nover which the required field strength can be maintained.\nThe average amount of signal photons then further depends on the repetition rate of the experimental setup.\nThe radiation generated from nuclear quadrupole shape\noscillations is suppressed as compared to this dipole radiation due to a center-of-mass motion, which is unfortunate, since quadrupole radiation is a unique signal for the\nabove discussed structural changes of the nucleus. Its detection may become feasible, however, once the required\nlaser intensities in the laboratory frame become available with high repetition rate. Also, by preparing large\nensembles of nuclei flying head-on into the laser beam,\nthe number of individual interactions may become large\nenough for the detection of quadrupole radiation.\nFinally, we would like to return back to the structural properties of nuclei in the laser field in contrast\nto atomic systems. The neutrons in nuclei are likely to\nadiabatically follow the periodic changes of the proton\nstates. Thus, not only the proton density, but also the\nmass density undergoes (tiny) quadrupole oscillations.\nFurthermore, non-closed-shell nuclei are superfluid systems, where the short-range pairing correlations soften\nthe Fermi edge and allow angular momentum paired\nnucleon-pairs to scatter into energetically higher-lying orbits. The presence of the laser field will also effect the\n\ncontinuum states in the nucleus and thus we may expect\nthat the pairing correlations will be altered. This then,\nin turn, affects the moment of inertia for deformed nuclei.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nOur work is motivated by the hope that externally controllable super-intense electromagnetic fields could enhance preparation, control and detection methods in nuclear physics similar to the tremendous success of such\ncontrol methods in atomic and molecular physics. We\nhave shown that a combination of cutting-edge lasers\nand ion accelerators available today or in the near future opens a pathway for the study of direct laser-nuclear\ninteractions. These interactions do not involve intermediate particles such as external electrons accelerated by\nthe laser pulse. The potential for such applications obviously will increase with improving laser and accelerator facilities. Ultimatively, resonant laser-nucleus interactions can be expected to be the most promising candidate for a direct manipulation of nuclei by coherent\nlight, but these require high-frequency laser sources. As\ndiscussed in this article, however, also off-resonant superintense laser fields in the optical frequency region may\ninduce signatures of direct laser-nuclei interactions. An\nimportant task, of course, remains to find convenient observables or experimental setups where the direct lasernucleus interactions can be observed or even crucially influence the outcome of a desired measurement. Examples\ncould be processes sensitive to resonance conditions subject to laser-induces shifts, or the observation of weak\nquadrupole radiation emitted due to oscillatory excitations of the nuclei.\nOur main observable, the AC-Stark shift, is closely related to work in atomic physics in order to facilitate a\ncomparison of these two branches. Despite the similarities of the nuclear AC-Stark shift calculations to the\natomic case, however, several differences between the\natomic and the nuclear case should be noted. First, in\nnuclei, the electromagnetic force is not the strongest force\npresent. The electric field generated by the laser field is\na perturbation on top of the inter-proton Coulomb force,\nbeing itself a perturbation on the strong nucleon-nucleon\nforce governing to a major extent the structure of the\nnucleus. In atoms, however, the electromagnetic force\nbetween electrons and the nucleus (and between electrons and electrons) is governing structure of the atom.\nSecond, nuclei do not possess a central Coulomb potential. Furthermore, the Coulomb force between protons\nwithin the nucleus is much stronger than the inter-atomic\nCoulomb force between electrons and the nucleus because\nof the much smaller size of the nucleus. Third, nuclei\npossess rich structural properties, i.e., collective excitations (rotations, vibrations, giant resonances), as well\nas single-particle excitations. Especially with respect to\ncollectivity, they resemble more molecules than atoms.\nObviously, these differences are of especial interest since\n\n\f9\nthey reflect the unique properties of nuclei as compared\nto atomic systems. Thus for the future, an investigation\nfocused on typical observables in nuclear physics, possibly based on the the specific differences of atomic and\nnuclear physics, is desirable. The proton rms radii discussed in this work are a first step in this direction, even\nthough we found that a measurement of laser-induced\nchanges in these radii is rather challenging.\nFinally, our study could also be of relevance for situations where indirect laser-nucleus-interactions occur, as\nit provides data on the modification of nuclear properties under the influence of external fields. For example, a\nlaser field utilized to create secondary particles which in\nturn interact with nuclei can also be expected to modify\nthe interaction of the nuclei with the auxiliary particles.\nIn summary, we have studied the direct off-resonant interaction of super-intense fields in the optical frequency\n\nregion with nuclei. In particular, laser fields which are\nin the optical region in the lab frame were considered,\npossibly in combination with an acceleration of the target nuclei. Then already field intensities available now\nor in the near future can induce AC-Stark shifts of the\nsame order as in typical quantum optical systems relative to the respective transition frequencies. We thus expect these direct laser-nucleus interaction to become of\nrelevance together with other super-intense light-matter\ninteraction processes such as pair creation.\n\n[1] M. O. Scully and M.
