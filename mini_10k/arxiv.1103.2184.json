Steel\nNovember 15, 2018\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGroup behavior has received much attention as a test case of self-organization.\nThere has been much written in recent years to investigate interactions within\ngroups of agents. These agents can be animals moving in an interactive way, such\nas birds, but can also refer to situations such as people driving in traffic. The\nmodels that describe these interactions are able to reproduce different structures\nand patterns relating to the movement and interaction of the agents involved.\nThe advantages and necessities of this type of analysis in any complex biological, technological, economic, or social system are important and far-reaching.\nEach model that we will discuss describes interaction between agents.\nFocusing on animal groups, such systems received attention not only from biologists and ethologists, but also from physicists, mathematicians, and engineers.\nThis interest has produced a huge amount of literature, which is well documented and reviewed: see, for instance, [7, 8, 11] and [3]. Loosely speaking, the\nbasic idea behind these works is that complex collective behavior arises from\nsimple interactions among close animals.\nThis paper considers a simple case of five birds in V formation, flying at\nconstant velocity. The aim is to study the feasibility of this solution and its\nstability for three models proposed in the literature.\nThe first model we will analyze was proposed in [4]. It is an agent-based model, in\nthe sense that each agent is singularly considered. The model is also leaderless,\nmeaning that all agents behave following the same set of rules and their behavior\nis not imposed by others. The model is purely based on attraction-repulsion\nintractions between group mates. Attraction allows the group to be formed\nand stay tight, while repulsion allows for coliision avoidance between group\nmates and keeps them well spaced. This model does not combine attraction\nand repulsion with velocity alignment, unlike many other models that have\nbeen proposed. The model also assumes that each agent interacts with a limited\nnumber of group mates that are in a suitable pre-defined sensitivity zone. The\nauthors were able to produce cluster formations, line formations and V-like\nformations by altering the attraction and repulsion parameters of their model.\nThe second model was proposed by Cucker and Smale in [6] and additional\nresults are available in [10]. The model is of second order, in the sense that\nthe dynamics is given for position and velocity of each animal. More precisely,\n1\n\n\feach animal adjusts its velocity to the mating ones, which are in its \"interaction\nnetwork\". The adjustment is done towards an average value of the various\ndifferent velocities. Therefore this approach is quite related to the theory of\nconsensus.\nThe third model is again a consensus-type model proposed by Olfati-Saber in\n[9]. In this case, beside the adjustment of velocity towards an average of mating\nbirds, there is a term which forces animal to keep a desired distance d. The\nlatter is thought as a suitable distance which taken into account both attraction\namong birds and repulsion for avoidance of conflicting trajectories.\nFor each model, we first show that the V formation is an admissible solution\n(for the first model we need to accurately choose parameters). Then we study\nstability of the linearization along the given V formation trajectory. The result\nis that the linearization of the first model gives rise to negative or zero eigenvalues, while the other models presents also positive eigenvalues. We can conclude\nthat the second and third model are exponentially unstable.\nIn other words, despite the fact that these models can represent V like formations, they are not able to represent stable V like formations. This indicates the\nneed of further modelling efforts.\n\n2\n\nAnimal groups models\n\nLet us start with the model proposed in [4], which we refer to as the CFP model.\nThe animals in the model are represented by point particles, which have simple\ncontinuous-time dynamics. Given N \u2208 N, for all i = 1, . . . , N and t \u2208 R\u22650 , let\nxi (t) \u2208 R2 represent the position of the i-th animal, whose evolution is described\nby the differential equation\n\u1e8bi (t) = vi (x(t)),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x(t) is the vector (x1 (t), . . . , xN (t)).\nThe velocity vi (x) is the sum of two contributions, expressing the effects of\nattraction and repulsion,\nvi (x) = via (x) \u2212 vir (x).\nIn more detail, each of these contributions depends on the relative position of\nthe other animals,\nvia (x) =\n\nX\n\nfa (kxj \u2212 xi k)\n\nxj \u2212 xi\nkxj \u2212 xi k\n\nX\n\nfr (kxj \u2212 xi k)\n\nxj \u2212 xi\n.\nkxj \u2212 xi k\n\nj\u2208An\ni\n\nvir (x) =\n\nj\u2208Rn\ni\n\nThe following definitions have been used.\n\n2\n\n\f\u2022 The function fa : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 (resp., fr : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 ) describes how each\nanimal is attracted (resp., repelled) by a neighbor at a given distance,\nassuming k * k denotes the Euclidean norm in R2 .\n\u2022 The attraction neighborhood Ani (resp., the repulsion neighborhood Rni )\nis the set of the n animals closest to the i-th one, which are inside the\nattraction (resp., repulsion) sensitivity zone.\nThe above model is very general, and we need to specialize it by choosing\nthe interaction functions and the shape of the sensitivity zones. We make the\nfollowing assumptions.\nA1. The functions fa and fr are assumed to be\nfa (kxj \u2212 xi k) = Fa kxj \u2212 xi k ,\n\nfr (kxj \u2212 xi k) =\n\nFr\n,\nkxj \u2212 xi k\n\nwhere Fa and Fr are two positive constants.\nA2. The sensitivity zones are depicted in Figure 1 and illustrated as follows.\nLet the center point be the animal's position, and let the horizontal axis\n(arrow-headed) represent the direction of motion. Attraction is active in\na frontal cone whose width is given by the angle \u03b1a \u2208 (0, 360\u25e6] (dashed\nline). Repulsion is active both inside a disk of radius Rsr > 0 (short-range\nrepulsion) and in a frontal cone of width \u03b1r \u2208 (0\u25e6, 360\u25e6] (solid line). We\nstress that the sensitivity zones do not necessarily coincide with the visual\nfield of the animal. They rather represent the zones which attraction and\nrepulsion are focused on.\nA3. The speed of each animal kvi k is bounded from above by a constant vmax .\nThe above assumptions result in the system\n\u1e8bi (t) = Fa\n\nX\n\nj\u2208An\ni\n\n(xj \u2212 xi ) \u2212 Fr\n\nX (xj \u2212 xi )\n.\nkxj \u2212 xi k2\nn\n\n(2)\n\nj\u2208Ri\n\nSome remarks are in order.\nR1. The definition of the interaction neighborhoods Ani and Rni allows to have\nan a priori bound on the number of effective neighbors, and therefore\non the sensing and \"computational\" effort which is required for each animal. This fact, which copes with animals' intrinsic limitations, has been\nexperimentally observed in biology, for fish [1] and birds [2]. The latter\npaper calls this neighborhood definition topological, as opposed to metric\ndefinitions, based on distance only.\nR2. Our assumption of unbounded sensitivity regions does not intend to imply\nthat animals sensing capabilities extend on an unlimited range, but rather\nthat group dynamics happen in a relatively small area.\n3\n\n\f\u03b1a\n\nRsr\n\u03b1r\n\nFigure 1: The shape of the sensitivity zones.\nR3. If \u03b1a = \u03b1r = 360\u25e6, the parameter Rsr has no effect, and the interaction is\ncompletely isotropic as in the simulations presented in [2, 5]. Note that,\neven if there is no preference for any specific direction, the limitation of\nthe number of considered neighbors makes the interactions not reciprocal,\ni.e. the fact that the i-th animal interacts with the j-th does not imply\nthat the j-th interacts with the i-th.\nR4. By specializing the functions fa and fr , one can obtain various interaction\nmodels. For instance, it is natural to assume that fr be decreasing and\nlims\u2192\u221e fr (s) = 0. Similar considerations are valid also for some features\nintroduced in other models, such as a neutral zone around animals or\na hierarchical decision tree which allows the repulsion force to have the\npriority over the attraction force.\nThe second model we will analyze is the Cucker-Smale model. It is inspired\nby the Cucker-Smale flocking model, and attempts to analyze animal behavior\nunder hierarchical leadership. The goal of this flocking study is to be able\nto interpret, model, analyze, predict, and simulate various flocking or multiagent behavior. The Cucker-Smale flocking model includes an interaction weight\nfunction which will allow us to analyze the birds in our formation by defining\nthe weight function appropriately. In a model of hierarchical leadership, the\nagents are ranked in some way and are therefore not independently motivated\nin their movement - that is, lower-rank agents are led by agents of higher ranks.\nUsing these assumptions, the paper goes on to discuss various flocks using these\n4\n\n\fassumptions.\nThe Cucker-Smale flocking model which is given by the autonomous dynamical\nsystem:\n\u001a\n\u1e8bi (t) = P\nvi ,\ni = 1, . . . , k, t > 0\nv\u0307i (t) = j\u2208L(i) aij (x)(vj \u2212 vi ),\n\nThis model differs from the previous model in that the motion in each bird is\ndefined in terms of \u1e8bi (t) and v\u0307i (t). In other words, this is a second order model,\nassuming acceleration driven by \"social forces\". In this case L(i) denotes the\nsubgroup of animals that directly influence agent i.\n\nThe third model we will analyze is from [9]. It presents a theoretical framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking algorithms. In this paper,\nthree flocking algorithms are presented: two are for free-flocking and one for\nconstrained flocking. As in the Cucker-Smale model, this model compensates\nfor velocity alignment. Their first algorithm generally leads to fragmentation,\nwhereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking behavior. However, unlike the second model, this paper asserts that flocks do not need leaders.\nThe paper also includes various simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms and analytical tools contained therein.\nThe model has a format similar to the Cucker-Smale ones. The motion of each\nbird's velocity described as follows:\nv\u0307i (t) =\n\nX\n\nj\u2208L(i)\n\n3\n\nX\nvj \u2212 vi )\n(kxj \u2212 xi k2 \u2212 d)(xj \u2212 xi )\n+\nkxj \u2212 xi k2\nj\u2208L(i)\n\nV formation\n\nFor purposes of this paper, we will consider five birds flying in a V-like formation in the context of three different models that have been put forth by various\nauthors. We will consider the motion of the birds over time and determine if\nequilibrium will be attained, and if that will lead to long-term stability, based\non these models.\nWe will assume that the birds fly in a coordinate plane parallel to the ground.\nFurther, we will consider five birds x1 ,..., x5 , and we will define their initial positions as follows:\nx1 = (\u22122, 2),\n\nx2 = (\u22121, 1),\n\nx3 = (0, 0),\n\nx4 = (\u22121, \u22121) x5 = (\u22122, \u22122).\n\nFurther, we will assume that the initial velocity of the birds is translation to\nthe right at velocity (1, 0) so they satisfy:\nxi (t) = xi,0 + (t, 0)\n\nwhere\n\nWe will call this the V evolution.\n\n5\n\ni = 1, ..., 5\n\n\f3.1\n\nCFP model\n\nAs stated above, this model considers a force of attraction and a force of repulsion. Each animal is both attracted and repulsed by the other birds by\npredetermined parameters.\nWe want the V evolution to solve the equations as described below:\n\u1e8bi (t) = Fa\n\nX\n\nj\u2208An\ni\n\n(xj \u2212 xi ) \u2212 Fr\n\nX (xj \u2212 xi )\n.\nkxj \u2212 xi k2\nn\n\nj\u2208Ri\n\nIn these equations, Fa and Fr are two positive constants. As we will be setting\n\u1e8bi (t) to zero, we will need to determine Fa and Fr explicity.\nThe region in the last equation depends on parameters \u03b1R (angle of anisotropic\nrepulsion regions), Rsr (radius of circular repulsion region) and \u03b1A (angle of\nanisotropic attraction region).\nWe will consider two cases:\n\u221a\ncase 1 \u03b1r = 90, Rsr = 2 and \u03b1a = 179.\n\u221a\ncase 2 \u03b1r = 360, Rsr = 2 and \u03b1a = 360.\nLet us first address case 1. Then, animal x3 will not consider the other birds,\nand will therefore keep constant velocity of (1, 0). Let us consider x4 . This\nanimal will feel both attraction and repulsion towards x3 , and not for the other\nbirds.\nTherefore, the equation for the motion of x4 will be defined as follows:\n\u1e8b4 (t) = Fa (x3 \u2212 x4 ) \u2212 Fr\n\n(x3 \u2212 x4 )\n.\nkx3 \u2212 x4 k2\n\nFor x4 above to be a solution to the model, we need the right-hand side of the\nequation to be zero. Taking into account that (x3 , x4 ) = (1, -1) this means\nFa (1, 1) \u2212\n\nFr\n(1, 1) = 0,\n2\n\nthus we need 2Fa =Fr .\nThe evolution for each bird in the V formation can be described as:\n\u1e8bi = \u03c6i (x1 , x2 , ..., x5 ).\nwhere we define\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\nx1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef x2 \uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\nX=\uf8ef\n\uf8ef x3 \uf8fa = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 x4 \uf8fb \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\nx5\n6\n\nx1,1\nx1,2\nx2,1\nx2,2\n...\nx5,1\nx5,2\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\fThe evolution of the whole formation can be written as\n\u1e8a = F (X),\nwhere\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\nF =\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\u03c61\n\u03c62\n\u03c63\n\u03c64\n\u03c65\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa=\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fb \uf8f0\n\nF1\nF2\nF3\n...\nF10\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nWe will linearize our system around our solution, the V solution. We will\ncompute the Jacobian matrix of the vector F of the right hand side of the\nequation above, for i = 1, . . . , 5 along the V solution. Thus F has a total of ten\ncomponents (two for each bird) with each element of the matrix determined by\nthe partial derivatives of F with respect to each component of X as:\n\u2202Fj\n\u2202xi,j\nFor instance, the two rows of the matrix that define the motion of x4 are F7\nand F8 .\nIt follows that\n(x32 \u2212 x42 )2 \u2212 (x31 \u2212 x41 )2 )\n\u2202F7\n= Fa \u2212 Fr\n\u2202x3,1\nk x3 \u2212 x4 k4\nThis leads to the value of 12 , which is inserted in the matrix. We then compute\nthe other values for F7 and F8 using partial derivatives. We perform similar\ncalculations for birds x1 , x2 , and x5 , assuming that x1 considers birds x2 and\nx3 , x2 only considers x3 and x5 considers x3 and x4 .

In this case, x3 feels both attraction and repulsion\nfor x2 and x3 (since we are now considering a circular repulsion region).

Steel\nFebruary 10, 2011\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGroup behavior has received much attention as a test case of self-organization.\nThere has been much written in recent years to investigate interactions within\ngroups of agents. These agents can be animals moving in an interactive way, such\nas birds, but can also refer to situations such as people driving in traffic. The\nmodels that describe these interactions are able to reproduce different structures\nand patterns relating to the movement and interaction of the agents involved.\nThe advantages and necessities of this type of analysis in any complex biological, technological, economic, or social system are important and far-reaching.\nEach model that we will discuss describes interaction between agents.\nFocusing on animal groups, such systems received attention not only from biologists and ethologists, but also from physicists, mathematicians, and engineers.\nThis interest has produced a huge amount of literature, which is well documented and reviewed: see, for instance, [7, 8, 11] and [3]. Loosely speaking, the\nbasic idea behind these works is that complex collective behavior arises from\nsimple interactions among close animals.\nThis paper considers a simple case of five birds in V formation, flying at\nconstant velocity. The aim is to study the feasibility of this solution and its\nstability for three models proposed in the literature.\nThe first model we will analyze was proposed in [4]. It is an agent-based model, in\nthe sense that each agent is singularly considered. The model is also leaderless,\nmeaning that all agents behave following the same set of rules and their behavior\nis not imposed by others. The model is purely based on attraction-repulsion\nintractions between group mates. Attraction allows the group to be formed\nand stay tight, while repulsion allows for coliision avoidance between group\nmates and keeps them well spaced. This model does not combine attraction\nand repulsion with velocity alignment, unlike many other models that have\nbeen proposed. The model also assumes that each agent interacts with a limited\nnumber of group mates that are in a suitable pre-defined sensitivity zone. The\nauthors were able to produce cluster formations, line formations and V-like\nformations by altering the attraction and repulsion parameters of their model.\nThe second model was proposed by Cucker and Smale in [6] and additional\nresults are available in [10]. The model is of second order, in the sense that\nthe dynamics is given for position and velocity of each animal. More precisely,\n1\n\n\feach animal adjusts its velocity to the mating ones, which are in its \"interaction\nnetwork\". The adjustment is done towards an average value of the various\ndifferent velocities. Therefore this approach is quite related to the theory of\nconsensus.\nThe third model is again a consensus-type model proposed by Olfati-Saber in\n[9]. In this case, beside the adjustment of velocity towards an average of mating\nbirds, there is a term which forces animal to keep a desired distance d. The\nlatter is thought as a suitable distance which taken into account both attraction\namong birds and repulsion for avoidance of conflicting trajectories.\nFor each model, we first show that the V formation is an admissible solution\n(for the first model we need to accurately choose parameters). Then we study\nstability of the linearization along the given V formation trajectory. The result\nis that the linearization of the first model gives rise to negative or zero eigenvalues, while the other models presents also positive eigenvalues. We can conclude\nthat the second and third model are exponentially unstable.\nIn other words, despite the fact that these models can represent V like formations, they are not able to represent stable V like formations. This indicates the\nneed of further modelling efforts.\n\n2\n\nAnimal groups models\n\nLet us start with the model proposed in [4], which we refer to as the CFP model.\nThe animals in the model are represented by point particles, which have simple\ncontinuous-time dynamics. Given N \u2208 N, for all i = 1, . . . , N and t \u2208 R\u22650 , let\nxi (t) \u2208 R2 represent the position of the i-th animal, whose evolution is described\nby the differential equation\n\u1e8bi (t) = vi (x(t)),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x(t) is the vector (x1 (t), . . . , xN (t)).\nThe velocity vi (x) is the sum of two contributions, expressing the effects of\nattraction and repulsion,\nvi (x) = via (x) \u2212 vir (x).\nIn more detail, each of these contributions depends on the relative position of\nthe other animals,\nvia (x) =\n\nX\n\nfa (kxj \u2212 xi k)\n\nxj \u2212 xi\nkxj \u2212 xi k\n\nX\n\nfr (kxj \u2212 xi k)\n\nxj \u2212 xi\n.\nkxj \u2212 xi k\n\nj\u2208An\ni\n\nvir (x) =\n\nj\u2208Rn\ni\n\nThe following definitions have been used.\n\n2\n\n\f\u2022 The function fa : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 (resp., fr : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 ) describes how each\nanimal is attracted (resp., repelled) by a neighbor at a given distance,\nassuming k * k denotes the Euclidean norm in R2 .\n\u2022 The attraction neighborhood Ani (resp., the repulsion neighborhood Rni )\nis the set of the n animals closest to the i-th one, which are inside the\nattraction (resp., repulsion) sensitivity zone.\nThe above model is very general, and we need to specialize it by choosing\nthe interaction functions and the shape of the sensitivity zones. We make the\nfollowing assumptions.\nA1. The functions fa and fr are assumed to be\nfa (kxj \u2212 xi k) = Fa kxj \u2212 xi k ,\n\nfr (kxj \u2212 xi k) =\n\nFr\n,\nkxj \u2212 xi k\n\nwhere Fa and Fr are two positive constants.\nA2. The sensitivity zones are depicted in Figure 1 and illustrated as follows.\nLet the center point be the animal's position, and let the horizontal axis\n(arrow-headed) represent the direction of motion. Attraction is active in\na frontal cone whose width is given by the angle \u03b1a \u2208 (0, 360\u25e6] (dashed\nline). Repulsion is active both inside a disk of radius Rsr > 0 (short-range\nrepulsion) and in a frontal cone of width \u03b1r \u2208 (0\u25e6, 360\u25e6] (solid line). We\nstress that the sensitivity zones do not necessarily coincide with the visual\nfield of the animal. They rather represent the zones which attraction and\nrepulsion are focused on.\nA3. The speed of each animal kvi k is bounded from above by a constant vmax .\nThe above assumptions result in the system\n\u1e8bi (t) = Fa\n\nX\n\nj\u2208An\ni\n\n(xj \u2212 xi ) \u2212 Fr\n\nX (xj \u2212 xi )\n.\nkxj \u2212 xi k2\nn\n\n(2)\n\nj\u2208Ri\n\nSome remarks are in order.\nR1. The definition of the interaction neighborhoods Ani and Rni allows to have\nan a priori bound on the number of effective neighbors, and therefore\non the sensing and \"computational\" effort which is required for each animal. This fact, which copes with animals' intrinsic limitations, has been\nexperimentally observed in biology, for fish [1] and birds [2]. The latter\npaper calls this neighborhood definition topological, as opposed to metric\ndefinitions, based on distance only.\nR2. Our assumption of unbounded sensitivity regions does not intend to imply\nthat animals sensing capabilities extend on an unlimited range, but rather\nthat group dynamics happen in a relatively small area.\n3\n\n\f\u03b1a\n\nRsr\n\u03b1r\n\nFigure 1: The shape of the sensitivity zones.\nR3. If \u03b1a = \u03b1r = 360\u25e6, the parameter Rsr has no effect, and the interaction is\ncompletely isotropic as in the simulations presented in [2, 5]. Note that,\neven if there is no preference for any specific direction, the limitation of\nthe number of considered neighbors makes the interactions not reciprocal,\ni.e. the fact that the i-th animal interacts with the j-th does not imply\nthat the j-th interacts with the i-th.\nR4. By specializing the functions fa and fr , one can obtain various interaction\nmodels. For instance, it is natural to assume that fr be decreasing and\nlims\u2192\u221e fr (s) = 0. Similar considerations are valid also for some features\nintroduced in other models, such as a neutral zone around animals or\na hierarchical decision tree which allows the repulsion force to have the\npriority over the attraction force.\nThe second model we will analyze is the Cucker-Smale model. It is inspired\nby the Cucker-Smale flocking model, and attempts to analyze animal behavior\nunder hierarchical leadership. The goal of this flocking study is to be able\nto interpret, model, analyze, predict, and simulate various flocking or multiagent behavior. The Cucker-Smale flocking model includes an interaction weight\nfunction which will allow us to analyze the birds in our formation by defining\nthe weight function appropriately. In a model of hierarchical leadership, the\nagents are ranked in some way and are therefore not independently motivated\nin their movement - that is, lower-rank agents are led by agents of higher ranks.\nUsing these assumptions, the paper goes on to discuss various flocks using these\n4\n\n\fassumptions.\nThe Cucker-Smale flocking model which is given by the autonomous dynamical\nsystem:\n\u001a\n\u1e8bi (t) = P\nvi ,\ni = 1, . . . , k, t > 0\nv\u0307i (t) = j\u2208L(i) aij (x)(vj \u2212 vi ),\n\nThis model differs from the previous model in that the motion in each bird is\ndefined in terms of \u1e8bi (t) and v\u0307i (t). In other words, this is a second order model,\nassuming acceleration driven by \"social forces\". In this case L(i) denotes the\nsubgroup of animals that directly influence agent i.\n\nThe third model we will analyze is from [9]. It presents a theoretical framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking algorithms. In this paper,\nthree flocking algorithms are presented: two are for free-flocking and one for\nconstrained flocking. As in the Cucker-Smale model, this model compensates\nfor velocity alignment. Their first algorithm generally leads to fragmentation,\nwhereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking behavior. However, unlike the second model, this paper asserts that flocks do not need leaders.\nThe paper also includes various simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms and analytical tools contained therein.\nThe model has a format similar to the Cucker-Smale ones. The motion of each\nbird's velocity described as follows:\nv\u0307i (t) =\n\nX\n\nj\u2208L(i)\n\n3\n\nX\nvj \u2212 vi )\n(kxj \u2212 xi k2 \u2212 d)(xj \u2212 xi )\n+\n2\nkxj \u2212 xi k\nj\u2208L(i)\n\nV formation\n\nFor purposes of this paper, we will consider five birds flying in a V-like formation in the context of three different models that have been put forth by various\nauthors. We will consider the motion of the birds over time and determine if\nequilibrium will be attained, and if that will lead to long-term stability, based\non these models.\nWe will assume that the birds fly in a coordinate plane parallel to the ground.\nFurther, we will consider five birds x1 ,..., x5 , and we will define their initial positions as follows:\nx1 = (\u22122, 2),\n\nx2 = (\u22121, 1),\n\nx3 = (0, 0),\n\nx4 = (\u22121, \u22121) x5 = (\u22122, \u22122).\n\nFurther, we will assume that the initial velocity of the birds is translation to\nthe right at velocity (1, 0) so they satisfy:\nxi (t) = xi,0 + (t, 0)\n\nwhere\n\nWe will call this the V evolution.\n\n5\n\ni = 1, ..., 5\n\n\f3.1\n\nCFP model\n\nAs stated above, this model considers a force of attraction and a force of repulsion. Each animal is both attracted and repulsed by the other birds by\npredetermined parameters.\nWe want the V evolution to solve the equations as described below:\n\u1e8bi (t) = Fa\n\nX\n\nj\u2208An\ni\n\n(xj \u2212 xi ) \u2212 Fr\n\nX (xj \u2212 xi )\n.\nkxj \u2212 xi k2\nn\n\nj\u2208Ri\n\nIn these equations, Fa and Fr are two positive constants. As we will be setting\n\u1e8bi (t) to zero, we will need to determine Fa and Fr explicity.\nThe region in the last equation depends on parameters \u03b1R (angle of anisotropic\nrepulsion regions), Rsr (radius of circular repulsion region) and \u03b1A (angle of\nanisotropic attraction region).\nWe will consider two cases:\n\u221a\ncase 1 \u03b1r = 90, Rsr = 2 and \u03b1a = 179.\n\u221a\ncase 2 \u03b1r = 360, Rsr = 2 and \u03b1a = 360.\nLet us first address case 1. Then, animal x3 will not consider the other birds,\nand will therefore keep constant velocity of (1, 0). Let us consider x4 . This\nanimal will feel both attraction and repulsion towards x3 , and not for the other\nbirds.\nTherefore, the equation for the motion of x4 will be defined as follows:\n\u1e8b4 (t) = Fa (x3 \u2212 x4 ) \u2212 Fr\n\n(x3 \u2212 x4 )\n.\nkx3 \u2212 x4 k2\n\nFor x4 above to be a solution to the model, we need the right-hand side of the\nequation to be zero. Taking into account that (x3 , x4 ) = (1, -1) this means\nFa (1, 1) \u2212\n\nFr\n(1, 1) = 0,\n2\n\nthus we need 2Fa =Fr .\nThe evolution for each bird in the V formation can be described as:\n\u1e8bi = \u03c6i (x1 , x2 , ..., x5 ).\nwhere we define\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\nx1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef x2 \uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\nX=\uf8ef\n\uf8ef x3 \uf8fa = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 x4 \uf8fb \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\nx5\n6\n\nx1,1\nx1,2\nx2,1\nx2,2\n...\nx5,1\nx5,2\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\fThe evolution of the whole formation can be written as\n\u1e8a = F (X),\nwhere\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\nF =\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\u03c61\n\u03c62\n\u03c63\n\u03c64\n\u03c65\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa=\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fb \uf8f0\n\nF1\nF2\nF3\n...\nF10\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nWe will linearize our system around our solution, the V solution. We will\ncompute the Jacobian matrix of the vector F of the right hand side of the\nequation above, for i = 1, . . . , 5 along the V solution. Thus F has a total of ten\ncomponents (two for each bird) with each element of the matrix determined by\nthe partial derivatives of F with respect to each component of X as:\n\u2202Fj\n\u2202xi,j\nFor instance, the two rows of the matrix that define the motion of x4 are F7\nand F8 .\nIt follows that\n(x32 \u2212 x42 )2 \u2212 (x31 \u2212 x41 )2 )\n\u2202F7\n= Fa \u2212 Fr\n\u2202x3,1\nk x3 \u2212 x4 k4\nThis leads to the value of 12 , which is inserted in the matrix. We then compute\nthe other values for F7 and F8 using partial derivatives. We perform similar\ncalculations for birds x1 , x2 , and x5 , assuming that x1 considers birds x2 and\nx3 , x2 only considers x3 and x5 considers x3 and x4 .

We can thus write:\n\u221a\nProposition 1 Consider the CFP model with \u03b1r = 90, Rsr = 2 and \u03b1a =\n179. Then the V formation is admissible and not exponentially unstable.\n7\n\n\fLet us now address case 2. In this case, x3 feels both attraction and repulsion\nfor x2 and x3 (since we are now considering a circular repulsion region). This\nleads to the following equation:\n\u1e8b3 (t) = Fa ((x2 \u2212 x3 ) + (x4 \u2212 x3 )) \u2212 Fr (\n\n(x2 \u2212 x3 )\n(x4 \u2212 x3 )\n+\n).\nkx2 \u2212 x3 k2\nkx4 \u2212 x3 k2\n\nHowever, the model fails to admit V formation as solution. When attempting\nto determine the coefficients for Fa and Fr , it becomes impossible to determine\nconstants that will allow the right side of the equation above to be set equal to\nzero.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Cucker-Smale model\n\nFor this model, we will apply similar computations and construct a similar\nmatrix to the last model, this matrix will now be 20 by 20 instead of 10 by 10,\nas each bird will have four components in the matrix, two for xi (t) and two for\nvi (t).\nSince xi (t) = vi for each bird, the rows of each matrix that correspond with \u1e8bi\nwill take the following form in the matrix:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\nwhen computing the partial derivatives with the four columns xi1 , xi2 , vi1 , and\nvi2 . The rows that correspond to v\u0307i (t) will be computed with partial derivatives\nas before. The form for each v\u0307i (t) will look as follows:\nVi =\n\n1\n(vj \u2212 vi )\nkxi \u2212 xj |2\n\nfor the bird(s) appropriately chosen.\nWe will assume that each bird interacts with the other birds as in Case\n1 for the CFP model. That is, bird 3 is independent of the other birds and\ntherefore produces zeroes in the matrix for the four rows corresponding to bird\n3. We compute partial derivatives as in the first model, and this generates the\nfollowing matrix:\n\n8\n\n\f\uf8ee 0\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8f0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nThis matrix has eigenvalues of 0, 1, and -1.
