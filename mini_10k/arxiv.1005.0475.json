They have an entropy proportional to the\ncross-sectional area of the event horizon divided by the square of the Planck length [1]\nand a temperature due to quantum Hawking radiation [2]. The subsequent development\nof the black hole membrane paradigm [3\u20135] showed that this behavior also extends to nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The equations governing dynamical horizons seem to be those\nof a viscous fluid, with apparent hydrodynamic transport coefficients such as viscosities. In\ngeneral though, the relationship between the dynamics of a fluid and the dynamics of any\nblack hole event horizon is just an analogy. The reason is that hydrodynamics is only a\nvalid effective theory of many-body systems on long spatial and time scales [6, 7]. This\nbasic criterion cannot be fulfilled even in the familiar example of a spherically symmetric\nSchwarzschild horizon. This is the reason why the membrane paradigm relates the black\nhole horizon to a fictitious fluid with unphysical negative bulk viscosity [8, 9].\nHowever, there are black hole spacetimes where a large scale hydrodynamic limit exists. Important examples are black holes and branes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS)\nspacetimes. These have been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade due\nto their role in the celebrated AdS/conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence [10, 11].\nThe correspondence relates (quantum) gravity in (D + 1)-dimensional asymptotically AdS\nspacetimes to certain conformal field theories on the (d + 1)-dimensional AdS boundary with\nd = D \u2212 1. In the duality, a classical black hole in AdS spacetime corresponds to a strongly\ncoupled thermal CFT on the boundary at the Hawking temperature. The large scale dynamics of the black hole therefore is dual to the hydrodynamics of the thermal gauge theory\n[12].\nHydrodynamic transport coefficients such as viscosities are calculated from a microscopic\ntheory using \"Kubo formulas\", which involve finite temperature Green's functions of conserved currents. This is not an easy calculation even at weak coupling (see for example, [13]),\nand seems to be extremely hard at strong coupling. However, the duality picture allows one\nto determine the transport coefficients of these strongly coupled theories in a fairly straightforward way by mapping the calculation of Green's functions into a classical boundary value\n2\n\n\fproblem in the bulk spacetime [14]. An application of this mapping is that the transport\ncoefficients of the dual gauge theory can be calculated directly at the black hole horizon\nfrom the membrane paradigm [15, 16]. A key early result that emerged from this work is\nthat, in the limit of infinite coupling, any (not necessarily conformal) gauge theory with an\nEinstein gravity dual has a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of \u03b7/s = ~/4\u03c0kB . This\nvalue was conjectured by Kovtun, Son, and Starinets (KSS) to be a universal lower bound\n[18]. Using the membrane formalism, general formulas have been recently developed which\ncharacterize the shear viscosity of gauge theories with generalized gravity duals in terms of\nan effective coupling of gravitons at the horizon [17].\nAlthough the universal KSS ratio seems to be rooted in gravitational physics, curiously\nit does not depend on the Newton constant GN . Furthermore, the ratio also appears to be\nsaturated even for a Rindler acceleration horizon in flat Minkowski spacetime [19], where\ngravity is absent. Indeed, one can assume that, like a black hole, the Rindler causal horizon\ncan be endowed with a finite area entropy density s. Although there is no holographic duality\nlike AdS/CFT in this case, the hydrodynamic limit exists and a shear viscosity of ~s/4\u03c0kB\nemerges when one studies the dynamics of the horizon using the membrane paradigm [8, 9].\nHowever, in the absence of a clear holographic duality, the interpretation of this shear\nviscosity to entropy density ratio seems to be unclear. For example, what is the underlying\nfluid system that is being probed by these calculations?\nThe fluctuation-dissipation theorem links viscous dissipation to fluctuations of a thermal\nequilibrium state. An attempt to interpret the viscous dissipation rate of a horizon in\nterms of the quantized gravitational fluctuations of the horizon shear was already developed\nmany years ago [20]. Here we take a different approach, based on the notion of quantum\nentanglement together with the properties of vacuum fluctuations.\nIt is well-known that observables restricted to the Rindler \"wedge\" of the global spacetime perceive the Minkowski vacuum to be a mixed thermal state at the Tolman-Unruh\ntemperature [21]. In addition, there is a corresponding statistical entanglement entropy for\nmatter fields in the Rindler wedge. This quantity is quadratically ultraviolet (UV) divergent, due to the infinite redshift/blueshift at the horizon. When a cut-off is introduced, the\nentropy scales not with volume of the wedge, but instead like the area of the horizon boundary. Hence the Rindler wedge is equipped with thermodynamic properties, which seem to\nbe naturally encoded into a \"pre-holographic\" lower dimensional description associated with\n3\n\n\fthe horizon boundary.\nOn large scales this thermal vacuum state should behave as a fluid, with hydrodynamics\nas an effective description. In this regime, we expect to find a holographic \"entanglement\nviscosity\" which, when similarly cut off, scales exactly with the entanglement entropy so\nthat the KSS ratio is satisfied universally. To test this hypothesis, we propose a microscopic\nKubo-like formula for the shear viscosity associated with the fluid description of the vacuum\nthermal state. The Kubo formula is constructed from the Green's functions of the energymomentum stress tensor for the matter fields in the wedge. All quantum fields in nature\nmust contribute to the vacuum fluctuations and therefore to the entanglement entropy and\nviscosity. For simplicity, we start by considering a free, minimally coupled scalar field theory.\nRemarkably, we show that the ratio of our shear viscosity to the entanglement entropy\ndensity is exactly the KSS ratio. This suggests that the KSS ratio may be a fundamental\nholographic property of spacetime (rather than just of the aforementioned AdS black hole\nsolutions).\nHowever, demonstrating the equivalence of the above defined ratio with the universal\nKSS one would require extending it to different field theories and higher dimensions.We try\nto generalize our approach with the simplest extension to a non-minimally coupled scalar\nfield theory. However, while the viscosity appears to be independent of the coupling to the\nscalar curvature, the status of the entropy density in the literature is less clear, the issue\nbeing closely tied to the general relationship between entanglement entropy and the black\nhole entropy. Finally, we re-calculate the ratio in a higher dimensional spacetime. Here the\n1/4\u03c0 result is apparently not readily extendable and we shall discuss the possible reasons\nwhy more work is needed in this direction (and the possible insights this investigation might\nlead to).\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we review the thermal properties\nof the Rindler wedge and the notion of entanglement entropy. In Section III, we discuss\ntwo examples where a shear viscosity emerges from classical hydrodynamics applied to the\nRindler thermal state. This serves as a motivation for the Kubo formula developed in\nSection IV. Section V contains our calculations for the free, non-minimally coupled scalar\nfield. We conclude in Section VI with the possible implications of our result, a discussion\nof the relationship between entanglement entropy and black hole entropy, and extensions to\nhigher dimensions.\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE RINDLER WEDGE AND ENTANGLEMENT\n\nWe start by reviewing the properties of the Rindler wedge associated with an accelerated\nobserver in Minkowski spacetime. Consider a general (D + 1)-dimensional flat manifold in\nthe Rindler coordinates Y A = (\u03c4, \u03be, xi ), where i = 1..d (d is the number of transverse spatial\ndimensions),\n2\n\nA\n\nds = gAB dY dY\n\nB\n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= \u03ba \u03be d\u03c4 \u2212 d\u03be \u2212\n\nd\nX\n\ndxi dxi .\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nHere \u03ba is an arbitrary constant with dimensions [L]\u22121 (we now work in units where ~ = c =\nkB = 1) associated with the normalization of the timelike Killing vector \u2202\u03c4 . The Rindler\nmetric can be obtained by a coordinate transformation of the usual Minkowski inertial\ncoordinates X A ,\nt = \u03be sinh(\u03ba\u03c4 )\nz = \u03be cosh(\u03ba\u03c4 )\nxi = xi .\n\n(2)\n\nUnlike the global inertial coordinates X A , the Rindler coordinates only cover a \"wedge\"\nsubregion of Minkowski space where z > |t|. The timelike Killing flow \u2202\u03c4 is equivalent to a\ncontinuous boost in the z direction. The respective boost time parameter \u03c4 is proportional\nto the proper time along the wordlines of the uniformly accelerated observer, defined by the\n\u03be = const hyperbolas. The null surface z = t acts just like the future event horizon of a\nblack hole since the points \"inside\" are causally disconnected from the accelerated observers.\nThe Rindler spacetime therefore mimics many of the properties of black holes in curved\nspacetimes. This statement is true not only at the classical level, but also when quantum\neffects are included. In the 1970's it was realized that quantization of fields on the Rindler\nspacetime (1) is inequivalent to the usual field quantization in full Minkowski spacetime.\nThe reason is that the Rindler Hamiltonian generates a flow in boost time. It follows that\nthe notion of the vacuum for the Rindler quantization must be different than the usual\nMinkowski vacuum |0i. A non-inertial observer will determine a different zero energy state,\ncalled the Fulling-Rindler vacuum |F i [22]. Unruh's discovery [21] was that the ordinary\nMinkowski vacuum |0i is precisely a thermal state in Rindler space.\nThe effect is rooted in the existence of the causal horizon. The trace over the unobservable\nparts of the Hilbert space naturally leads to a mixed state, which for deep reasons tied to\n5\n\n\fthe Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum, turns out to be exactly thermal in any quantum field\ntheory [23]. The precise statement, which can be proved using path integral methods [24],\nis that\nh 2\u03c0H R\ni\nR\ni\n\u03ba\nh0|\u00d4 (t, x , z)|0i = T r e\n\u00d4 (\u03c4, x , \u03be) .\nR\n\ni\n\n(3)\n\nTherefore, the Minkowski vacuum expectation value of any operator \u00d4 R restricted to Rindler\nwedge (i.e. z \u2265 |t|) is equivalent to a thermal average at the constant Unruh-Tolman\ntemperature T0 = \u03ba/2\u03c0. As said, the factor \u03ba is an arbitrary rescaling factor for the proper\ntime \u03c4 , as such it can always be set to one. We shall however keep it explicit for the moment\nas a bookkeeping quantity for the Rindler wedge temperature.\nSince the vacuum is a thermal state in the Rindler wedge, one can study the entropy\nassociated with this system. This idea goes back to two seemingly different calculations by 't\nHooft [25] and Bombelli, Koul, Lee, and Sorkin (BKLS) [26]. 't Hooft calculated the thermal\npartition function at the Hawking temperature for a scalar field outside a very massive\nSchwarzschild black hole, which the Rindler spacetime closely approximates. Since the local\nUnruh temperature T = T0 (\u03ba\u03be)\u22121 = (2\u03c0\u03be)\u22121 diverges at the horizon, the entropy diverges\nas well and must be regularized by replacing the horizon with a \"brick wall\" boundary\ncondition. The resulting entropy scales like the cross-sectional area of the horizon.\nSeparately, BKLS pointed out that there is also generic statistical von Neumann entropy\nSent = \u2212T r \u03c1\u0302 ln \u03c1\u0302,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 is an entanglement density matrix that results from tracing over the unobservable\nregions of the Hilbert space. This entropy exists even at zero temperature and in general scales like the area of the horizon boundary. Therefore it must be regularized with a\nultraviolet (UV) cutoff, which yields in four spacetime dimensions Sent \u223c A/l2c .\nFor the spacetimes with a causal horizon, the thermal and quantum pictures of the\nentropy turn out to be equivalent because, as we saw in (3), the density matrix \u03c1\u0302 is precisely\na thermal Gibbs state. Since a natural choice for the UV cutoff is roughly the Planck\nlength, the entanglement entropy should be an important part of the Bekenstein-Hawking\n(BH) entropy. However, in general, all quantum fields will make a contribution to the\nentanglement entropy. This leads to the so called \"species problem\": the entanglement\nentropy depends on the number and type of fields, while the BH entropy is universally\nA/4l2p .\n6\n\n\fHowever, the entanglement entropy can be thought of as a one-loop quantum correction\nto the classical, tree-level BH entropy. The quadratic divergence in the entanglement entropy\nseems to match the quadratic divergence that appears in the renormalization of the Newton\nconstant [27\u201330]. Thus, the species problem might be solved by taking the Newton constant\nin the BH entropy to be the renormalized Newton constant. In this context, an attractive\nidea is that there is no tree-level gravitational entropy and that entanglement entropy (or in\ngeneral the matter contribution to the entropy) is all the BH entropy [28, 31]. This would\nimply the Newton constant and gravity itself is entirely \"induced\" by quantum matter\nfluctuations, as first argued by Sakharov [32].\n\nIII.\n\nRINDLER WEDGE HYDRODYNAMICS\n\nIn this section we will review two examples where a shear viscosity emerges from the\nhydrodynamics of the Rindler wedge. In the first example a global Rindler spacetime is\nbeing perturbed on a large scale with the dynamics governed by Einstein equation [8, 9].\nTo work conveniently at the horizon we rewrite the metric (1) in Eddington-Finkelstein like\ncoordinates with the following parametrization\nv = \u03c4 + (2\u03ba)\u22121 ln(r)\nr = \u03ba\u03be 2\nx\u0303i = \u03ba\u22121 xi ,\n\n(5)\n\nso that the metric has the form\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nds = \u03bardv \u2212 dvdr \u2212 \u03ba\n\nd\nX\n\ndx\u0303i dx\u0303i .\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nConsider a uniform boost of the Rindler spacetime (6) in x\u0303i directions, which is an isometry\nof the vacuum state. The result is a boosted metric\nds2 = \u03baru\u03bc u\u03bd dx\u0303\u03bc dx\u0303\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc dx\u0303\u03bc dr \u2212 \u03ba2 P\u03bc\u03bd dx\u0303\u03bc dx\u0303\u03bd ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the (d + 1)-dimensional set of coordinates is x\u0303\u03bc = (v, x\u0303i ), the (d + 1)-dimensional\nvector u\u03bc = (\u03b3, \u03b3v i ) (i.e. u\u03be = 0), and the projection tensor P\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd . One can\nthink of this bulk spacetime as describing a general flow of the thermal state with velocity\nv i with respect to the frame of a static observer.\n7\n\n\fNow imagine, for example, gravitational waves are impinging on the system. To parameterize the perturbations, we can take u\u03bc (x\u0303\u03bc ) and \u03ba(x\u0303\u03bc ) (thereby associating a scale with \u03ba),\nso that the temperature and (d+1)-velocity of the flow are slowly varying functions of the x\u0303\u03bc\ncoordinates. In particular, the hydrodynamic limit requires the scale L of the perturbations\nto satisfy L \u226b \u03ba\u22121 . The metric\nds2 = \u03ba(x\u0303)r u\u03bc (x\u0303)u\u03bd (x\u0303)dx\u0303\u03bc dx\u0303\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc (x\u0303)dx\u0303\u03bc dr \u2212 \u03ba2 (x\u0303)P\u03bc\u03bd dx\u0303\u03bc dx\u0303\u03bd\n\n(8)\n\nis no longer flat and hence does not satisfy RAB = 0. However we can obtain a solution (at\nleast in principle) to the vacuum Einstein equations working order by order in a derivative\nexpansion. We take u(\u03b5x\u0303\u03bc ) and \u03ba(\u03b5x\u0303\u03bc ) where \u03b5 is a book keeping factor (set to unity at the\nend of calculations) to keep track of derivatives of temperature and velocity. For example,\nat lowest order there should be solution to the equations RAB = 0 + O(\u03b52) of the form\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\ngAB = gAB + \u03b5gAB (\u2202u, \u2202\u03ba),\n\n(9)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere gAB is a O(\u03b5) correction to the metric (8).\nIn the membrane paradigm, we want to consider the subset of (d + 1) vacuum Einstein\nequations projected into the Rindler horizon\nR\u03bc\u03bd l\u03bd = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere l\u03bc is the null normal to the horizon. At lowest order, l\u03bc = u\u03bc . Note that u\u03bc is unit\nnormalized with respect to the flat metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , but is null on the horizon (r = 0) of the full\nbulk metric. Using the horizon Gauss-Codazzi equations and the membrane paradigm, this\nset of Einstein equations can be expressed solely in terms of horizon geometrical variables i.e. the extrinsic curvature components (the horizon shear, expansion, surface gravity) and\nintrinsic metric of the horizon surface. At the lowest orders in \u03b5, it is sufficient to calculate\nthese quantities directly from the metric (8), the near-horizon data, and a choice of gauge.\nFor example, the horizon shear is just the fluid shear, which is given by the symmetric,\ntrace-free transverse part of \u2202\u03bc u\u03bd\n\u03c3\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = P\u03bc\u03c3 P\u03bd\u03c4 (\u2202\u03c3 u\u03c4 + \u2202\u03c4 u\u03c3 \u2212 2/d \u03b7\u03c3\u03c4 \u2202\u03b3 u\u03b3 ),\n\n(11)\n\nand the horizon expansion is\n\u03b8\u0303 = \u2202\u03bc u\u03bc + du\u03bc \u2202\u03bc ln \u03ba.\n8\n\n(12)\n\n\fRemarkably, up to O(\u03b52 ) the Einstein equations (10) imply\nR\u03bc\u03bd l\u03bd = \u2202\u03bd T(F ) \u03bd \u03bc = 0,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03bd T(F ) \u03bd \u03bc = 0 are the hydrodynamic equations of a viscous conformal fluid living on\na flat Minkowski metric in one less dimension. In general, a viscous fluid stress tensor has\nthe form of a perfect fluid, plus shear and expansion terms that are first order in \u03b5\nT(F ) \u03bd \u03bc = \u01ebu\u03bc u\u03bd + P (\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc + u\u03bc u\u03bd ) \u2212 2\u03b7\u03c3\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03beB (\u2202\u03c3 u\u03c3 )\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc .\n\n(14)\n\nHere \u03beB = 0, consistent with the conformal condition that T \u03bc \u03bc = 0, while the shear viscosity\nis \u03b7 = v/16\u03c0GN [9], where v is a scalar area density associated with the horizon. Assuming\na Bekenstein-Hawking area entropy density v/4GN , the shear viscosity to entropy density\nratio turns out to be precisely the KSS ratio.\nThe second example is the proposal (first due to [33] and expanded upon in [19]) that\nthe Einstein equations and macroscopic spacetime dynamics are just the thermodynamics of\nthe local vacuum state. The idea is to impose a general entropy balance law on the vacuum\nstate in Rindler wedge, since it has temperature and entropy. One assumes a finite entropy\ndensity s per unit horizon area, with s possibly dependent on the field content. When the\nthermal density matrix \u03c1\u0302 at temperature T0 in (3) is perturbed, the change in entanglement\nentropy is related to the change in mean energy via\ndS = \u03b4hEi/T0 + \u03b4N,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the additional \u03b4N is an irreversible internal entropy production term, or \"uncompensated heat\". Using linear constitutive relations between fluxes of momentum in a fluid and\nthe thermodynamic \"forces\" given by gradients of a fluid velocity, the entropy production\nterm can be expressed in terms of the squared shear \u03c3\u0303\u03bc\u03bd and expansion \u03b8\u0303 of the flow\n\u03b4N =\n\n2\u03b7\n\u03beB\n\u03c3\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd + \u03b8\u03032 ,\nT0\nT0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03beB are the shear and bulk viscosities respectively [34, 35]. Because the change\nin the mean energy is due to the flux into the unobservable region of spacetime, which is\nperfectly thermalized by the horizon system, it is assumed to consist entirely of heat. Thus,\nwe have the thermodynamic entropy balance law dS = \u03b4Q/T0 + \u03b4N. The second assumption\nconsists in the fact that this relation should hold for all causal horizons, with \u03b4Q as the flow\n9\n\n\fof boost matter energy across the horizon. Since the area of the horizon is no longer fixed,\nthe spacetime must become dynamical.\nIn a general spacetime, a local horizon can be defined in analogy with a black hole horizon.\nA global definition of the latter is the boundary of the causal past of future null infinity. The\nsegment of a black hole horizon to the causal past of a spatial cross-section is the boundary\nof the past of that cross section. A local horizon at a point p is defined in a similar way:\nchoose a spacelike 2-surface patch B including p, and choose one side of the boundary of\nthe causal past of B. Near p, this boundary is a congruence of null geodesics orthogonal to\nB, which comprises the horizon.\nThe equivalence principle implies the spacetime in the neighborhood of any point p is\napproximately flat. In this patch of spacetime one can always construct a local Rindler\nwedge and associate the boundary of the causal past of B with the local Rindler horizon.\nAt p the expansion and shear of the horizon in terms of the local boost Killing vector \u03c7\u03bc\nautomatically vanish, because p is a fixed point of the local boost flow. This defines the\nnotion of local equilibrium.\nTo compute the entropy change \u03b4S = s\u03b4A, one must follow the area change of the horizon\n(here we assume a four dimensional bulk spacetime)\nZ\n\u03b4A = \u03b8 d\u03bbd2 A,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03b8 = d(ln d2 A)/d\u03bb is the expansion of the congruence of null geodesics generating the\nhorizon and \u03bb is an affine parameter along the geodesics. Using the Raychaudhuri equation,\nd\u03b8\n1\n= \u2212 \u03b82 \u2212 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc k \u03bd ,\nd\u03bb\n2\nthe entropy change is given up to O(\u03bb2 ) by the series expansion\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\nZ \u0014\n1 2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\nd\u03bbd2 A.\n\u03b8 + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3 + R\u03bc\u03bd k k\n\u03b4S = s\n\u03b8\u2212\u03bb\n2\np\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nHere k \u03bc = \u2212\u03bb\u22121 \u03c7\u03bc is affinely parameterized tangent vector to the horizon, and \u03c3 is the\nshear with respect to the affine flow. Note that all quantities in the integrand are evaluated\nat p. The heat flux across the horizon has the form\nZ\n\u03b4Q\n= 2\u03c0 T M \u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc k \u03bd (\u2212\u03bb)d\u03bbd2 A,\nT0\n\n10\n\n(20)\n\n\fwhere T M \u03bc\u03bd is the matter stress tensor. If it is required that the entropy balance law holds\nat all points p, we first find that the affine expansion at p must vanish since the heat flux\n(20) vanishes at p. At O(\u03bb) the integrands of (20) and (19) then imply the relation\n(2\u03c0)T M \u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc k \u03bd = sR\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc k \u03bd ,\ndescribing reversible processes, and the identification\nZ\ns\n\u03b4N =\n\u03c3\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd d\u03c4 d2 A\n\u03ba\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nin the irreversible sector, where in the above expression we have substituted the affine expansion and shear with their Killing analogues: \u03b8\u0303 = \u2212\u03ba\u03bb \u03b8 and \u03c3\u0303 = \u2212\u03ba\u03bb \u03c3. Now, comparison\nof (22) with (16) implies \u03b7 = sT0 /2\u03ba = s/4\u03c0, which is exactly the KSS ratio.\nFurthermore, Eqn. (21) holds for all null vectors k \u03bc . This implies\nR\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a6g\u03bc\u03bd = (2\u03c0/s) T M \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is a so far undetermined function. The free function \u03a6 can be fixed if it is assumed\nthat the matter stress tensor is divergence free, corresponding to the usual local conservation of matter energy. Taking the divergence of both sides of (23) and using the contracted\nBianchi identity \u2207\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd = 21 \u2207\u03bc R we then find that \u03a6 = \u2212 12 R \u2212 \u039b, corresponding to the Einstein equation with undetermined cosmological constant \u039b. The derived equation describing\nreversible changes matches the Einstein equation, with Newton's constant determined by the\nentropy density s,\nGN =\n\n1\n,\n4s\n\n(24)\n\nor conversely, s = 1/4GN = 1/4L2P . This also implies that the shear viscosity is 1/16\u03c0GN\nand that the dissipative term (22) can be exactly identified with the well-known HartleHawking formula for the tidal heating of a classical black hole [36\u201340].\nIt seems that once we demand a finite area entropy density for Rindler horizons, an\nentropy balance law can naturally imply gravity. This would more generally indicate that\nany Lorentz invariant quantum field theory with a UV cutoff (and therefore a finite entropy\nand a large, but finite number of degrees of freedom) must have gravity. Interestingly,\nthis sort of induced gravity is consistent with the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the usual\nformulation, the CFT on the boundary has no cutoff and infinite entanglement entropy.\n(d+1)\n\nThis corresponds to the case where GN\n\n= 0 and the CFT on the boundary is not coupled\n11\n\n\fto gravity. Introducing a cutoff to the CFT corresponds to a brane in the AdS bulk that\ncuts off the region from some radial coordinate r0 to infinity. The dual CFT on the brane\nis coupled to gravity and has a finite entanglement entropy that seems to match the BH\nentropy [41].\n\nIV.\n\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND KUBO FORMULA\n\nTogether the two examples above provide a mutually consistent picture of a shear viscosity\ncoefficient emerging from large scale perturbations of the Rindler thermal state. Typically, in\nclassical hydrodynamics the viscosities are phenomenological coefficients, either measured\ndirectly in the laboratory or calculated by matching to a microscopic description of the\nfluid system. However, in the above examples, our classical calculations require both the\nentropy density and the viscosity to have a trivial relation to the observed low energy\nNewton constant. All the dependence on the number and nature of the quantum fields is\napparently absorbed into this quantity. In order to explore this unexpected universality\nfurther, we would like to find a microscopic description for the shear viscosity in terms of\nthe fluctuations of a thermal state in a finite temperature quantum theory.\nFirst, it is instructive to consider calculations of viscosity in the AdS/CFT (or more\ngenerally, \"gauge/gravity\") correspondence. In this case, \u03b7 and s are the viscosity and\nentropy density of an infinitely strongly coupled (d + 1)-dimensional finite temperature\ngauge theory with a dual gravitational description in terms of a black hole or brane in AdS\nspacetime. The gauge theory lives in flat Minkowski spacetime and is thought of as being\non the hologram at the AdS boundary. In the duality prescription, a massless field \u03c6 in\nthe bulk spacetime is dual to an operator O in the boundary field theory. In particular,\nperturbations of the bulk field act as sources for the field theory operators on the boundary\nvia the coupling\nZ\n\n\u03c60 O dd+1 x,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c60 is the boundary value. For small perturbations, determining the change of the\nexpectation value of O is a well-known problem in time dependent perturbation theory. In\nFourier space (k 0 , ~k) the result is [42]\nh\u03b4O(k 0 , ~k)i = GR (k 0 , ~k)\u03c60 (k 0 , ~k),\n12\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhere GR is the retarded two point thermal Green's function (the brackets represent a\nthermal average) of O,\nGR (k , ~k) =\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n~\n\ndtdd xeik t e\u2212ik*~x \u03b8(t)h[O(x), O(0)]i.\n\n(27)\n\nOn the other hand, linear response theory [35] implies that in the large scale limit k 0 , ~k \u2192 0\nh\u03b4O(k 0 , ~k)i = \u03c7\u2202t \u03c60 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03c7 is some generic phenomenological transport coefficient. Matching these two descriptions, one finds the Kubo formula\n1\nImGR (k 0 , ~k = 0).\n\u21920 k 0\n\n\u03c7 = lim\n0\nk\n\n(29)\n\nTherefore, generic dissipative transport phenomena are described by fluctuations about the\nthermal equilibrium state. In the case of shear viscosity, the relevant field operator O is\nthe stress tensor T xy (or, in general, the trace-free spatial parts of T \u03bc\u03bd , see (14)), while\n\nthe classical source \u03c6 is identified with corresponding transverse metric perturbations, for\nexample hxy .\nThe prescription for computing the retarded Green's function is to first solve the perturbation equations for h\u03bc\u03bd , subject to the Dirichlet condition at the asymptotic boundary and\nrequiring at the horizon the field be purely ingoing [43]. From the on-shell action, one can\nderive [16]\n\u03a0(r, k 0 , ~k)\n,\n\u21920 r\u2192\u221e ik 0 \u03c6(r, k 0 , ~\nk)\n\n\u03c7 = lim\nlim\n\u03bc\nk\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03a0 is the radial canonical momentum conjugate to the field. In the low frequency limit\nit turns out that radial evolution of \u03a0 is trivial. Essentially all the relevant physics is at\nthe horizon and this is the natural place to evaluate the above quantity. In the near-horizon\nlimit the geometry of a black hole solution dual to a gauge theory thermal state reduces to\nthe Rindler metric. Furthermore, in the membrane paradigm, the condition that fields be\nregular at the horizon immediately fixes the shear viscosity in terms of the coupling constant\nfor transverse gravitons. In Einstein gravity, the result is simply the universal gravitational\ncoupling \u03b7 = (16\u03c0GN )\u22121 (which matches the results discussed in Section II), while in higher\nderivative theories one can derive a formula for \u03b7 in terms of horizon quantities similar to\nWald's Noether charge formula for the entropy [17].\n13\n\n\fIn flat Rindler space, there is no holographic duality of the AdS/CFT type, i.e. no string\ntheoretic mapping between classical bulk fields and operators in a strongly coupled theory\nand no timelike boundary surface at infinity capable of supporting a dual holographic theory.\nTherefore the type of constructions reviewed above for calculating Green's functions do not\nappear to be available to us. However, as we have seen, there is a type of holography at\nthe horizon due to entanglement when observables in the vacuum state are restricted to a\nsubregion. For example, the entropy of fields in the Rindler wedge is naturally associated\nwith the horizon boundary. Since the degrees of freedom in the wedge are packed into\nthis membrane surface, the physics of the bulk spacetime can be effectively reduced to a\nlower dimensional description associated with a \"stretched horizon\" boundary. Therefore\nthe shear viscosity associated with the Rindler horizon must be induced by the matter fields\nin the quantum vacuum state, just like the entanglement entropy.\nThe dual lower dimensional description of the vacuum state and the near-horizon degrees\nof freedom are characterized by the stress-energy tensor (14) and as such can be associated\nto a strongly coupled thermal CFT living effectively on the flat Minkowski metric ds2 =\nP\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = d\u03c4 2 \u2212 i dxi dxi . In addition, we expect the total energy-momentum in the\nbulk Rindler space should be the total energy-momentum of the dual description.\n\nIn Rindler space the explicit translational symmetry in the z (or \u03be) direction is broken.\nHowever, the symmetry in the other directions remains, so that the Lagrangian of a field\ntheory must be invariant under\nx\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc + a\u03bc .\n\n(31)\n\nUsing the Noether theorem we can write a canonical energy-momentum tensor for the bulk\nfields in the Rindler spacetime\nT(R) \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u2202LR\n\u2202\u03bd \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc LR ,\n\u2202(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8)\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c8 represents a generic matter field. This stress tensor is conserved quantity in the flat\n\u221a\nspacetime sense: \u2202\u03bc TR \u03bc\u03bd = 0. Note that the Lagrangian density is LR = \u2212gLMink (where\nLMink is the field Lagrangian in Minkowski spacetime) and evaluates to LR = \u03ba\u03beLMink.\nTherefore, the canonical energy-momentum tensor for the Rindler wedge is \u03ba\u03be times the\n(\u03bc\u03bd) components of usual Minkowski space stress tensor, T\u03bd\u03bc .\nOn large scales, the holographic state must be described by a conserved lower dimensional\n\n14\n\n\fstress tensor operator hT\u0302 (d+1)\u03bc\u03bd i,\n\u2202\u03bc hT\u0302 (d+1)\u03bc\u03bd i = 0.\n\n(33)\n\nHere the brackets represent a thermal average Z \u22121 T r(\u03c1T\u0302 (d+1)\u03bc\u03bd ) at the Tolman-Unruh\ntemperature, which by (3) is equivalent to the Minkowski vacuum expectation value\nh0|T\u0302 (d+1)\u03bc\u03bd |0i. As a simple ansatz we assume\nZ \u221e\nZ\n(d+1)\u03bc\n\u03bc\nhT\u0302\nd\u03be hT\u0302(R) \u03bd i =\n\u03bdi =\nlc\n\n\u221e\nlc\n\nd\u03be \u03ba\u03behT\u0302\u03bd\u03bc i,\n\n(34)\n\nthat the energy-momentum density in the lower dimensional description is a radial integral\nof the bulk quantities, which as usual must be cut off at a stretched horizon located at\nproper distance lc from the true horizon in order to be rendered finite.\nThis prescription is consistent with the literature on thermodynamic quantities in Rindler\nwedge. The Minkowski vacuum expectation value h0|T\u0302BA |0i for free spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin1 fields in the Rindler wedge was calculated long ago [44]. To regularize the stress tensor\noperator, one can impose a Fulling-Rindler subtraction\nhF |T\u0302BA |F i = 0.\n\n(35)\n\nAs expected, one finds that the Minkowski vacuum expectation value has the form of a\nperfect fluid stress tensor. For example, in four spacetime dimensions the bulk energy\ndensity for a scalar field has the Planckian form\n\u01eb(\u03be) =\n\n1\n\u03c02T 4\n=\n.\n30\n480\u03c0 2 \u03be 4\n\n(36)\n\nFrom our ansatz (34), we find an energy density that appropriately scales like the area of\nthe horizon boundary [45]\n\u01eb2+1 =\n\n\u03ba\n.\n960\u03c0 2l2c\n\n(37)\n\nUsing the Gibbs relation \u01eb + P = sT , and equation of state \u01eb = 3P for the massless bulk\nscalar field, we find the entropy density s obeys\ns=\n\n2\u03c0 3 3\n1\nT =\n.\n45\n180\u03c0\u03be 3\n\n(38)\n\nIntegrating over \u03be from lc to \u221e to find the effective area entropy yields\ns=\n\n1\n,\n360\u03c0l2c\n15\n\n(39)\n\n\fwhich agrees with standard results in the literature for the brick wall/entanglement entropy [25, 27, 45].\nIf we apply the formalism of viscous hydrodynamics to this system, the shear viscosity\nshould be given by the Kubo formula (29) in terms of the effective stress tensor of the lower\ndimensional theory associated with the horizon\nZ\n1\nd+1\nd+1\n\u03b7 = lim\nd\u03c4 dd xei\u03c9\u03c4 \u03b8(\u03c4 )h[Txy\n(\u03c4, x, y), Txy\n(0)]i,\n\u03c9\u21920 \u03c9\n\n(40)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is a Rindler frequency.

This\n\ntype of expression is similar to those developed in [47]. The authors showed that correlation\nfunctions of certain operators expressed as an integral of a density over a sub-volume of\nMinkowski are UV divergent and scale like the horizon/boundary area. As an example, they\nfound the heat capacity due to entanglement in the Rindler wedge.\nAs a first test case of our viscosity formula, we consider the thermal state to consist\nof a free, minimally coupled scalar field in a four dimensional Rindler spacetime. One\napparent problem with this choice is that the shear viscosity in an free field theory is typically\nill-defined. In physical terms, shear viscosity measures the rate of transverse momentum\ndiffusion between the elements of a fluid. Although the quasi-particle description in kinetic\ntheory is not a good one in a strongly coupled system, we can gain some guidance by thinking\nof shear viscosity as a diffusion process. One can show that \u03b7 \u223c \u01eblmfp , where lmfp is the mean\nfree path of the fluid. Since in a free field theory the mean free path diverges, \u03b7 diverges as\nwell. This is just a consequence of the breakdown of the effective hydrodynamic theory.\nOn the other hand, in our case the equivalence principle implies a field theory in Rindler\nspace can be thought of as being in a constant gravitational field. As we argued in Section\nII, imposing a UV cutoff on this system seems to introduce gravitational dynamics. If the\ncutoff is placed near the Planck length (as we suspect) the gravitational dynamics is strongly\ncoupled there. The idea is that the dominant effect in the relaxation of the vacuum thermal\nstate is the strongly coupled gravitational interaction. This also seems to explain how there\n16\n\n\fcan be universality in the result for \u03b7. In principle, all quantum matter fields should be\npresent in the the vacuum state. However, the ratio \u03b7/s should be 1/4\u03c0 regardless of the\ntype of quantum fields in the wedge or the dimension of the spacetime. Since gravity interacts\nwith all fields in the same way, it should not make a difference whether we consider the soup\nof fields to be made up of a free scalar field, free fermions, or some type of interacting fields.\n\nV.\n\nVISCOSITY CALCULATION\n\nSince the thermal average is at the Tolman-Unruh temperature T0 , by (3) it is equivalent\nto an ordinary Minkowski vacuum expectation value\nh0|[Txy (\u03c4, x, y, \u03be), Txy (0, \u03be \u2032)]|0i\n\n(42)\n\nwhich makes calculations much simpler. One can compute the correlator in the Minkowski\nvacuum state, change from inertial coordinates X A to Rindler coordinates Y A and then\nperform the Fourier transform. The Minkowski stress tensor for a free, massless scalar field\nhas the form\nTBA =\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202B \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b4BA L,\n\u2202(\u2202A \u03c6)\n\n(43)\n\nwhere L = g AB \u2202A \u03c6\u2202B \u03c6. One can insert this in Eqn. (41) which is in terms of the retarded\nGreen's function, but it is also possible to write the Kubo formula in terms of different types\nof Green's functions. Since the thermal Green's functions satisfy the relation [43]\nG1 (\u03c9, p) = \u2212 coth\n\n\u0010\u03c9 \u0011\nImGR (\u03c9, p),\n2T\n\n(44)\n\nwhere the G's represent Green's functions constructed from any local bosonic operator, one\ncan also work with the symmetrized Schrodinger-Hadamard correlator of the stress tensor\nG1 (\u03c9, p) .

Instead, if we use the Fulling-Rindler\nsubtraction (35) these Casimir type terms must be present.

However, it turns out we have to include an even number of the poles\n(two or all four) in order to preserve the symmetry of the integrand under the interchange of\n\u03be and \u03be \u2032 . In the case of the Wightman function, we have the explicit i\u01eb prescription, which\nis to include both poles on the real axis in the contour (by pushing them up), while leaving\nout the ones at 2\u03c0i/\u03ba.

Comparing with our \u03b7 in (70) with the entanglement entropy density calculated\npreviously (39), we find\n\u03b7/s = 1/4\u03c0.\n\n(71)\n\nThe UV cutoff length cancels out and we are left with exactly the KSS ratio.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have argued that the universal shear viscosity to entropy density ratio\nof 1/4\u03c0 is also associated with a Rindler causal horizon in a flat (either globally or locally)\nspacetime. Its appearance in this case is mysterious since there is no gravity and the familiar\nformalism of AdS/CFT holography is completely absent. In order to provide a microscopic\nbasis for this result, we have turned to the properties of quantum entanglement and vacuum\nfluctuations. Namely, when a quantum state is restricted to a sub-region of the spacetime\n(in this case Minkowski vacuum state in the Rindler wedge), quantum fluctuations of this\nstate have a dual, thermal description associated with the horizon boundary. An effective\n21\n\n\fdescription of the large-scale dynamics of this vacuum thermal state is always provided by\nhydrodynamics. To this end, we have developed a simple Kubo-like formula for the viscosity\ninduced on the horizon in terms of a two point stress-energy tensor correlation function for\nthe quantum fields in the Rindler wedge. We calculated this quantity in the simplest case\nof a free massless scalar field in a four dimensional spacetime and found the ratio of our \u03b7\nto the entanglement entropy s is exactly 1/4\u03c0 1 .\nOur result suggests that the 1/4\u03c0 ratio might be a fundamental property of quantum\nentanglement and its associated holography. It also provides support for the hypothesis that\nsemi-classical gravity on macroscopic scales is induced or emergent as an effective theory of\nsome lower dimensional, strongly coupled quantum system with a large number of degrees\nof freedom. In this picture, the 1/4\u03c0 ratio is saturated in gauge theories with an Einstein\ngravity dual because 1) they have an area (BH) entropy and 2) as we mentioned at the end\nof Section III, in the large N limit the number of degrees of freedom diverges and gravity is\nturned off as the Newton constant goes zero.\nIt would be useful to understand if our results can be extended to more general quantum\nfield theories and to higher dimensional spacetimes. Since all fields in nature contribute in\nprinciple to the vacuum fluctuations, our hypothesis is that the \u03b7/s ratio is 1/4\u03c0 universally\nfor any matter field. Also, the arguments of Section III can be extended to any dimen\u22121\n\u22121\nsion; since the BH entropy density is (4GD\nand \u03b7 = (16\u03c0GD\nfor a general spacetime\nN)\nN)\n\ndimension D, the ratio should not depend on the number of dimensions.2\nAs a simple first check of a different field theory, we considered a massless, but now\nnon-minimally coupled scalar field given by the action\nZ\n1 \u221a\nIs =\n\u2212g(\u2207A \u03c6\u2207A \u03c6 \u2212 \u03beC R\u03c62 ).\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n(72)\n\nNote that, strictly speaking, we have not proven our result is independent of the regularization scheme\nused on \u03b7 and s. However, we do not expect the choice of regularization to matter since both divergences\narise in the same radial integration over the local energy-momentum density.\nIn the old membrane paradigm of Damour, Price, and Thorne, the ratio of the shear viscosity coefficient\nto entropy density is indeed 1/4\u03c0 regardless of dimension. This is because the Hartle-Hawking tidal\ncoefficient is 1/16\u03c0GD (otherwise independent of dimension), while s is always 1/4GD . Note however that\none has to be careful when identifying this ratio with the KSS ratio, since in the Schwarzschild spacetime\na hydrodynamic long wavelength expansion is not possible.\n\n22\n\n\fIn the flat spacetime limit, the stress tensor reduces to\n1\nTAB = \u2202A \u03c6\u2202B \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b7AB (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 2\u03beC \u2202A (\u03c6\u2202B \u03c6) + 2\u03beC \u03b7AB \u2207C (\u03c6\u2207C \u03c6).\n2\n\n(73)\n\nRepeating the steps at the beginning of Section IV, we arrive at the following for the Wight\u2032\nman function of the stress tensor G+\nxy,xy (\u03c4, x, y, \u03be, \u03be ) in terms of the scalar field Wightman\n\nfunction G(\u03c4, x, y, \u03be, \u03be)\n\u2032\n2 2 +\n2 +\n+\n2 +\nG+\nxy,xy (\u03c4, x, y, \u03be, \u03be ) = (1 \u2212 2\u03beC ) (\u2202x G )(\u2202y G ) \u2212 4\u03be(1 \u2212 2\u03be)(\u2202x G )(\u2202x \u2202y G )\n\n\u22124\u03be(1 \u2212 2\u03be)(\u2202y G+ )(\u2202x2 \u2202y G+ ) + 4\u03beC2 G+ (\u2202x2 \u2202y2 G+ ) + (1 \u2212 4\u03beC + 8\u03beC2 )(\u2202x \u2202y G+ )(\u2202x \u2202y G+ ).(74)\nInserting in the form of the Wightman function (56), we can calculate the Fourier transform\nin (59). Integrating over x and y as before, we find (63) again. The dependence on the\ncoupling to the scalar curvature \u03beC vanishes in the low momentum regime, and therefore \u03b7\nis not changed.\nThere are different results in the literature for the entropy density s of a non-minimally\ncoupled scalar field. In [29], the authors worked in the brick-wall approach, calculating\nthe density of states for a thermal field outside the horizon. In this case, since the scalar\ncurvature on the background spacetime is always zero, the \u03beC dependence drops out of the\nscalar field equation and the entropy density is unchanged. This is consistent with our\ncalculation and, if we use this result, the ratio is preserved. However, there is an important\ndifficulty here that cannot be overlooked. The divergence in the entropy density found\nby [29] cannot be absorbed into the renormalization of the Newton constant, which is \u03beC\ndependent. This is a problem since we have argued both the entanglement entropy and the\nviscosity are proportional to the (renormalized) Newton constant.\nOn the other hand, the entropy can also be calculated in an Euclidean functional integral\napproach from the one-loop effective action. In this case, one works off-shell and includes\nthe contributions of manifolds where \u03b2 6= 2\u03c0/\u03ba. When the solution is not the HartleHawking instanton (\u03b2 = 2\u03c0/\u03ba), the manifolds have a conical singularity and therefore the\nscalar curvature coupling contributes a delta function term to the partition function. The\nresulting entropy is \u03beC dependent and can in fact be reabsorbed into the renormalized\nNewton constant [30, 49]. However, there is an interpretational issue with this result. When\n\u03bec > 1/6 the statistical mechanical contribution to the entropy seems to be negative, while\nSent = \u2212T r \u03c1\u0302 ln \u03c1\u0302 must be positive definite [50].\n23\n\n\fThe reason for this unusual behavior is rooted in the fact that the black hole entropy\nhas in this case an additional non-statistical term proportional to the integral of \u03c62 over the\nhorizon\nSN = 2\u03c0\u03bec\n\nZ\n\nH\n\n\u221a\n\u03c62 \u2212hd2 x,\n\n(75)\n\nwhich can be thought of as a Noether charge correction term [31]. Indeed, if one considers\na non-minimal field coupled to gravity\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n\u03beC\nR\n4 \u221a\n2\n2\nIgrav = d x \u2212g\n+ (\u2207\u03c6) \u2212 R\u03c6\n16\u03c0G 2\n2\n\n(76)\n\nthe resulting theory is a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, whose classical Wald Noether charge\nentropy [51] includes the correction (75). Note that this kind of correction is not limited to\nnon-minimally coupled scalar fields. It also appears in generic vector field theories [52]. The\nblack hole entropy is generally composed of three contributions: a statistical entanglement\nentropy, the non-statistical \"bare\" gravitational entropy and the Noether charge term. Induced gravity models remove the need for the bare gravitational entropy, but they currently\ncannot fully explain the existence of the Noether charge term from a statistical point of view\n[53].\nHence our preliminary investigation of the viscosity to entropy density ratio in different\nfield theories has lead us to a key issue. Namely, while the \u03b7/s ratio seems to remain 1/4\u03c0\nif we compare our entanglement viscosity only to the statistical entanglement entropy, in\ngeneral the relevant quantities are the black hole (Wald) entropy and likely a corresponding\ngeneral definition of viscosity. The problem is that the Wald entropy in general diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity does not just depend on the horizon area. This does not\nseem to fit with the induced gravity scenario implied by the thermodynamics of spacetime\nargument, reviewed in Section III, where the horizon entropy is purely due to entanglement.\nIn this sense, the investigations [19] seem to lend some insight towards a possible resolution. In particular, different formulations of the equivalence principle and their role in\ndetermining the characteristics of a gravitational theory may be the key point. The only\nknown theory of gravity consistent with the strong equivalence principle is Einstein gravity.\nThe strong equivalence principle implies that gravity is purely geometrical. Physics (gravity\nincluded) is the same in any locally flat region of spacetime, which means GN is a universal\nconstant and there are no extra gravitational fields. Under these conditions the UV cutoff lc should be a constant. However, in a general theory of gravity (such as scalar-tensor\n24\n\n\ftheories), the strong equivalence principle is not satisfied. Consequently, it is reasonable to\nassume the UV cutoff to be dependent on the spacetime location. In this case it is necessary\nto promote it to a spacetime field, which will have to be a dynamical one in order to assure\nthe background independence of the resulting gravitational theory. This is exactly what is\nnaturally suggested by the extensions of the spacetime thermodynamics approach beyond\nGeneral Relativity [19]. If this is true, it may be always possible to re-express the Wald\nentropy in the form of an entanglement entropy by suitably characterizing the spacetime\ndependence of lc 3 . We leave this for future investigation.\nWe now move on to the viscosity to entropy density ratio in higher dimensions. To test\nthe ratio here we considered a free scalar field in higher even dimensional Rindler spacetimes.\nThis is again the simplest case, because in any odd spacetime dimension the scalar and stress\ntensor Wightman functions are inverse fractional powers of spacetime interval. In these cases\nthe Fourier transform (59) has branch cuts, not just simple poles and the entire analysis\nhas to be re-done. Here we present the calculation in six dimensions.The scalar Wightman\nfunction has form\nG+ (\u03c4, x, y, \u03be, \u03be \u2032) =\n\n1\n1\n.\n4\u03c0 3 (\u03bb + \u01eb(t)i\u01eb)2\n\n(77)\n\nThis form can be inserted into (55); otherwise the Kubo formula is unchanged. In the\nFourier transform we must now integrate over two additional transverse spatial directions\nusing the generalization of (61). The result is\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n+\n\u2032\nd\u03be\nei\u03c9\u03c4 d\u03c4\nd\u03be\nG\u0303xy,xy (\u03c9, \u03be, \u03be ) =\nlc\n\nlc\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n3\n\u03ba2 \u03be\u03be \u2032\n.\n140\u03c0 3 (\u03be 2 + \u03be \u20322 \u2212 2\u03be\u03be \u2032 cosh(\u03ba\u03c4 ))4\n\n(78)\n\nRepeating the contour integration over \u03c4 and the integrations over \u03be and \u03be \u2032, we find that\nthe viscosity is\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n.\n33600\u03c0 3 l4c\n\n(79)\n\nTo compute the entropy density, we need the Planckian energy density for a gas of bosons\nin six-dimensions. This has the form\n\u01eb=\n3\n\n2\u03c0 5/2\n\u0393(6)\u03b6(6)T 6,\n(2\u03c0)5 \u0393(5/2)\n\n(80)\n\nA related proposal can be found in [54], where the authors found that Wald entropy evaluated on static,\nspherically symmetric black hole solutions in generalized theories of gravity can be expressed as A/4Geff ,\nwhere Geff is an effective gravitational coupling at the horizon.\n\n25\n\n\fwhere \u0393(x) is the gamma function and \u03b6(x) the Riemann zeta function. Our ansatz (34)\ngives the lower dimensional energy density\n\u01eb4+1 =\n\n\u03ba\n.\n24192\u03c0 3l4c\n\n(81)\n\nUsing the Gibbs relation and the equation of state \u01eb = 5P , we find an entropy density\ns=\n\n1\n,\n10080\u03c0 2 l4c\n\n(82)\n\nwhich means an \u03b7/s ratio of 3/10\u03c0.\nIt is fairly straightforward to extend the above calculation to even higher dimensions\n(eight and ten) by modifying the Wightman function and the Planckian energy density.\nThese results show that in higher dimensions the ratio is a rational number factor (> 1)\ntimes 1/4\u03c0. If there is not a mistake in our calculation, one could worry that the appearance\nof the KSS ratio in four dimensions is simply an amazing coincidence.\nHowever, this seems unlikely to us. One possibility is that in higher dimensions the\ndivergence of the entropy can only be absorbed into the renormalized Newton's constant up\nto an overall factor. While this is not the most likely explanation, so far we have found no\nliterature that conclusively addresses this question. Another issue is that the energy density\nfor the scalar field may not be purely Planckian in a higher dimensional Rindler space. This\nis not out of the realm of possibility since, for example, it is known that higher spin fields\nin Rindler do not have a Planckian form even in four dimensions [44]. Furthermore, the\nvacuum expectation value in Rindler space is related to the conformal anomaly present for\nfields on the conformally related metric of the Einstein universe [55]. In different spacetime\ndimensions the conformal anomaly takes on different forms. In any case, it is conceivable\nour result for the entropy density (82) could be incorrect.\nAnother more subtle possibility is that the naive extension of our simple ansatz for the\nshear viscosity is not valid in higher dimensions. One could imagine, based on the membrane\nparadigm [8, 9] that the entropy density and the viscosity of the Rindler horizon are in\nfact controlled by a (d + 1)-dimensional CFT associated with the near-horizon degrees of\nfreedom. The idea of identifying the near-horizon degrees of freedom of a black hole with\na CFT has appeared many places in the literature [56], but in the past the CFT has been\nthought of as being universally 1+1 dimensional and identified with physics in the radial\n(\u03be)-time (\u03c4 ) plane. Perhaps our simple ansatz for Rindler space holography matches a more\n26\n\n\ffundamental description only in the special case of a four dimensional spacetime, while in\nhigher dimensions it would not correctly reproduce the properties of the near-horizon theory.\nHowever, this is all very speculative. Making these remarks more concrete will be subject\nfor future research.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank Y. Oz, A. Roura, and M. Visser for useful comments.\n\n[1] J. D.
