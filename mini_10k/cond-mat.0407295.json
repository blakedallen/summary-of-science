An anomalous bias dependence of tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) has been observed, the first of its kind in a symmetric electrode tunnel junction\nwith single insulating barrier.

This serves as a strong evidence for the existence of\nminority spin tunneling states at the half-metal insulator interface.\nPACS numbers: 73.40.Gk, 73.40.Rw\n\n1\n\n\fIn recent years Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) [1] has become the subject of great\ninterest because of the richness in physical properties it exhibits, and potential applications.\nIt has been observed that the transport properties of MTJ depend not only on the ferromagnetic metal electrodes but also on the insulator-electrode couple and its interface and\nthat the insulator plays a crucial role in selecting bands that can tunnel [2, 3]. However, not\nmuch thought has been given to what happens to the band structure at the interface between\nthe half metal and the insulator in MTJs consisting of half metals. Till date there is no\nevidence of minority spin states in manganite tunnel junction interfaces, although there are\nreports of existence of minority spin states in manganites [4]. The present article establishes\nthe presence of minority spin tunneling states in half metal near the half metal-insulator\ninterfaces. An extremely sharp zero bias anomaly in the bias dependence of TMR has been\nobserved.\nIn almost all MTJs, the Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR; \u03b4R/R = (RAP \u2212 RP )/RAP\nwhere RAP , RP are the resistances in the antiparallel and parallel magnetization configuration respectively.) decreases with increasing bias voltage [1]. Several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to explain this behaviour. For example, there are processes like spin independent two-step elastic tunneling via defect states [5] in the insulating barrier and inelastic\nprocesses like spin flip scattering by magnon excitations [6, 7], magnetic impurities [8] in\nthe barrier etc. The effect of density of states (DOS) [9] or the influence of electric field on\nthe barrier height is often discussed in explaining the variation of TMR at higher bias. It\nis believed that in the low bias region the electronic band structure of the electrodes play\nfundamental roles. Yet we do not observe the effect of sharp variation of electronic density\nof states (DOS) about the Fermi level at zero bias (for reasons to be discussed later). This\nreport is a clear demonstration of the effect of drastic DOS variation around the Fermi level\nnear the interface.\nHere we report the transport properties of a manganite MTJ where Ba2 LaNbO6 has\nbeen introduced as the insulating barrier. The MTJ was prepared by pulsed laser deposition. The trilayer La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 (LSMO)/Ba2 LaNbO6 (BLNO)/LSMO was deposited\non single crystalline SrT iO3 (100) substrate held at a temperature 8000 C and the oxygen\npressure was 400 mTorr. BLNO has a complex cubic perovskites structure and can be\ngrown epitaxially on single crystal perovskite substrates [10, 11]. The thickness of the bottom LSMO layer is 1000\u00c5 and that of the top layer 500\u00c5 while the estimated thickness of\n2\n\n\fthe insulating spacer from the deposition rate calibration of BLNO is 50\u00c5. The microfabrication in the cross-strip geometry was done using photolithography and ion-beam milling.\nThe bottom layer was patterned using photolithography while the top electrode and the insulating layer using ion-beam milling. The junction area is 50 \u00d7 50\u03bcm2 . The transport and\nmagnetoresistive properties were measured in the current perpendicular to plane geometry\nusing four terminals method with the magnetic field applied in the plane of the sample.\nThe junction resistance in the absence of magnetic field shows a distinct peak at around\n125 K (Fig: 1), typical of manganite tunnel junctions [12, 13]. With increase in bias level\nthe temperature dependence of junction resistance becomes weaker(Fig: 1). The conductance curves show parabolic voltage dependence(Fig: 2). We have fitted the differential\nconductance vs. voltage curves using asymmetric barrier Brinkman model [15] in different\nvoltage ranges. The average barrier height and the barrier width turns out to be in the\nrange 0.2 \u2212 0.25 eV and 32 \u2212 37\u00c5 respectively. The asymmetry in the barrier obtained from\nthe Brinkman model is very small, about 3 \u2212 4 mV only and hence the current-voltage characteristics can be well fitted with symmetric barrier Simmons model [14], producing similar\nresults. The barrier parameters like average barrier height and barrier width are almost temperature independent within the relevant temperature range. All these observations indicate\nthat the device is free of any pinhole shorts and tunneling is the dominant transport mechanism [16]. The highest value of TMR obtained at any bias current is around 10% . Low\nTMR value signifies a considerable reduction of spin polarization at the electrode-barrier\ninterface. The tunnel magnetoresistance vanishes above 150K, as is the case generally for\nmanganite tunnel junctions [17].\nThe observed bias dependence of TMR(Fig: 3) has an unusual feature. Previous reports\non bias dependence show that Tunnel Magnetoresistance decreases with increasing bias voltage and there is not much appreciable variation around zero bias [1]. Here we have observed\nthat the TMR undergoes a sharp rise(Fig: 3) with increasing bias voltage below 20 \u2212 25 mV\nat 6K. Only one or two groups [2, 3, 18] have seen bias dependence like this but there are\nsome striking differences between their observations and ours. For example, De Teresa et\nal. [2] observed such bias dependence in case of Co/SrT iO3/La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 hybrid tunnel\nJunction and Sharma et al. [3] observed this in case of MTJ with composite barrier where\nthe TMR undergoes a sharp decrease as one approaches zero bias. In all those cases highly\nasymmetric barrier is the key factor in the anomalous bias dependece of TMR.

The continuous lines are the Brinkman fits.\n\nare dealing with a half metallic tunnel junction with single insulating barrier. There is a\nmarginal asymmetry in the bias dependence. This is due to a small barrier asymmetry close\nto 3 \u2212 4 mV which is very small compared to the average barrier height of 0.20 \u2212 0.25 eV.\nThis is manifested in the conductance minimum at low temperature(Fig: 2) being shifted\nwith respect to zero bias.\nThere are several factors contributing to the bias dependence of TMR. If there exists\ndefect sites within the barriers, creation of states either thermally or by hot electron impact\n\n4\n\n\fwill facilitate two-step tunneling. Since these states are not polarized, the two-step tunneling\nis spin independent and does not contribute to TMR. With increase in bias voltage, density\nof available defect states increases exponentially. As a result the two-step tunneling current\nincreases sharply with increasing bias voltage, thus reducing the TMR with increasing bias.\nThere are other inelastic processes that can infuence the bias dependence. For example\n\"hot electrons\" tunneling across the insulating barrier may lose their energy by emitting a\nmagnon and thereby flipping the electron spin. With increasing bias more magnons can be\nemitted, resulting in reduced TMR. Spin flip scattering cross-section due to magnetic impurities in the barrier increases with increasing bias thus reducing the TMR. The existence\nof coulomb gap due to metallic inclusions at the junction interface also reduces the TMR\nwith increasing bias [12]. Obviously these higher order tunneling processes cannot explain\nthe anomalous bias dependence around zero bias.\nBiasing an MTJ leads to the contributions from electrons, which tunnel from the occupied states below the Fermi level of one electrode to the empty states at the same energy\nabove the fermi level of the other electrode. Due to the change in DOS of ferromagnets\nas a function of energy, the spin polarization should be voltage dependent and hence the\nTMR. But in practice, the nature of bias dependence in almost all MTJ's does not seem to\nreflect that. This is because for transition metals, although most of the spin polarization\ncomes from d-band, majority of the tunneling electrons are from s-band which is not sharply\npolarized. There is no significant change of this situation if we take into account the effect\nof s-d hybridization [19]. On the other hand, in half metals like manganites, the spin up\nand spin down bands are completely split (Fig: 4) resulting in the spin polarization being\nimmuned to the sharp variation in DOS near the band edge. Thus the DOS variation with\nchange in bias voltage does not affect the spin polarization.\nThe observed bias dependence can be interpreted as follows. Due to the perturbation\ncaused by the complex band structure of the insulating barrier, the spin split band edges at\nthe interfaces get modified in such a way that there is a substantial overlap of the up and\ndown spin bands below the Fermi level(Fig: 4). This results in the introduction of minority\nspin states. The existence of minority spin states will bring the variation in majority spin\nDOS into play because then it will strongly influence the tunneling spin polarization. At\nlow bias, the DOS for the majority spin band around Fermi level is much less than at higher\nvoltage and the DOS slope is also much sharper at near the Fermi level.

Inset: Band structure of\nbulk LSMO\n\nin bias voltage from zero value, the majority spin DOS increases sharply (Fig: 4). Hence\nwithin a certain bias window around zero bias the spin polarization can have a sharp rise\nwith increasing bias. Still one should expect the TMR to increase beyond the observed bias\nrange considering the large band width in LSMO (half band width 0.75eV ). But at higher\nvotages the opening up of inelastic conduction channel is bound to have an influence on the\nbias dependence of TMR. Thus we get the fingerprint of the DOS profile only in the low\nbias range.\nA small inverse TMR (where RAP < RP ) is also observed in the extreme vicinity of zero\nbias. Inverse TMR is expected in systems with the two different electrodes having opposite\nspin polarizations within a certain bias range [20]. In our case the majority and minority\n\n6\n\n\fspin DOS become comparable near the Fermi level at zero bias. And since there is a small\nrelative zero bias shift of Fermi levels between the two electrodes, it may give rise to Inverse\nTMR near zero bias.\nTo summarize, we propose that the observed anomalous bias dependence of TMR can\nbe considered as the experimental demonstration of the influence of interfacial DOS around\nzero bias in a symmetric MTJ and that the influence of the insulating barrier can lead to\nthe formation of minority spin tunneling DOS at the interfaces of a half metallic tunnel\njunction.\n\n[1] J.
