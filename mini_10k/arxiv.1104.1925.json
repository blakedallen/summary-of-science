Further, it is also clear that this acceleration had set in at a relatively recent time in the cosmological calendar. Starting with observations of Type 1A supernovae[1, 2], this feature of the Universe is now strongly\nsuggested by observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB)[3], large-scale structures[4], baryon\nacoustic oscillations[5] and gravitational lensing[6]. Although observational confirmations are piling up, a\nconvincing theoretical framework is still lacking. Several interesting mechanisms have been suggested to explain this feature of the universe, such as cosmological constant[7], quintessence[8], modified gravity[9\u201311],\nchaplygin gas[12, 13] and many others. However, these models have their own shortcomings. For example, models with a non-zero cosmological constant need a high degree of fine tuning [8, 14\u201319] whereas\npotentials required for quintessence models are unnatural in the context of particle physics[20]. Appealing to higher dimensional cosmological models is another promising mechanism to explain this mysterious\nphenomenon. This is the line of approach we adopt in this paper.\nThere are various possible constructs in the extra dimensional context including (but not limited to)\nbrane world models [21\u201323]. Here, we consider a particular simple model akin to that used in Ref[24].\nWhereas Ref[24] invoked extra dimensions to solve the horizon problem in early universe, using an anisotropic\nfluid residing in 1+D1 +D2 dimensions, we adapt the formalism to produce a late time acceleration instead.\nMotivated by observations, we assume that the universe is filled with a uniform density matter. However, the pressure exerted by the matter in the normal dimensions is different from that in the compact\ndimensions, while being isotropic within each subspace. As we will argue, observations severely constrain\nthe functional dependence of the pressure on the density. Within this constraint, however, a very simple\nform of the equation of state gives an excellent agreement with data. Although pressureless matter would,\nnormally, decelerate the expansion of the universe rather than accelerating it, it is the interplay with the\nhidden dimensions that provides the impetus for this expansion.\nIt should be clarified at this stage that our construct is not a brane-world scenario and that we do\nnot attempt to address issues such as the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\nWe, rather, make the simplifying assumption that these extra dimensions are compactified to a scale small\nenough to play essentially no direct role at the TeV scale. In this sense, the spirit is closer to more canonical\nscenarios defined in dimensions larger than four (an example could be a generic model derived from String\nTheory). Possible phenomenological manifestations of such models are postponed to future discussions.\nThe rest of the paper is constructed as follows. In section 2, the formalism of the model is developed,\nand the equation of state argued for. In the subsequent section, we present the solutions to the ensuing\nevolution equations. In Section 4, we compare the predictions of the model with data and infer the preferred\nvalues of the parameters. And, finally, we conclude in Section 5.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f2\n\nEvolution Equations\n\nWe start with a spacetime which has, in addition to one temporal and three normal spatial dimensions, D\nextra spatial dimensions. This 1 + 3 + D dimensional spacetime is described by the line element\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndR2\ndr 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ r d\u03a9 + b (t)\n+ R d\u03a9D\u22121 .\nds = \u2212dt + a (t)\n(2.1)\n1 \u2212 k1 r 2\n1 \u2212 k2 R2\nWe reserve the super(sub)script '0' for the time dimension. Whereas lower-case Roman indices (i, j =\n1, 2, 3) denote the normal spatial dimensions, upper case Roman indices denote the extra dimensions and\ntake the values I, J = 4, 5, ....., D + 3. Here, D is a parameter which takes integral values and is to be fixed\nby comparing with observations.\nIn eq. (2.1), a(t) denotes the scale factor in the normal (3)- dimensions and b(t) represents the scale\nfactor in the extra dimensions. Since we consider the entire (1 + 3 + D)-dimensional universe to be homogeneous, the two scale factors a and b are functions only of the time t. As is well known, the visible universe\nis well described by a vanishing spatial flatness (k1 = 0) and we shall assume the situation to be so. For\nreasons of simplicity as well as symmetry with the observed sector, we shall assume k2 = 0 as well.\nFor this line-element, the components of the Einstein tensor G\u03bc\u03bd (with \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, . . . , D + 3) read\n\u02272 D(D \u2212 1) \u1e032\n\u0227 \u1e03\n\u22123 2 \u2212\nab\na\n2\nb2\n2\nb\u0308\n\u0227 \u1e03 \u0227\nD(D \u2212 1) \u1e032\n\u00e4\n\u2212 2\u2212\n\u2200i\nGii = \u22122 \u2212 D \u2212 2D\na\nb\nab a\n2\nb2\nb\u0308\n\u00e4\n\u0227 \u1e03\nD \u1e032\n\u02272\nGII = (1 \u2212 D) \u2212 3 + 3(1 \u2212 D)\n+ (D \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 ) 2 \u2212 3 2\nb\na\nab\n2 b\na\nG00 = \u22123D\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\u2200I .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor is assumed to be of the form\nT\u03bd\u03bc = diag(\u2212\u03c1, Pa , Pa , Pa , Pb , . . . , Pb )\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the energy density of the fluid and Pa (Pb ) is the pressure exerted in normal (extra) dimensions.\nThis form of energy momentum implies that there is isotropy within the subspace associated with the normal dimensions and also within the orthogonal subspace spanned by the extra dimensions. However, the\npressures in the two subspaces are different. Note that it is the observed large-scale isotropy of the universe\nthat prompts one to consider an isotropic matter distribution. No such restriction applies to the pressure\nexerted in the extra dimensions, and thus, we could as easily have considered more elaborate structure for\nTJI . However, other than adding more freedom to the model, this would not have resulted in any particular\nqualitative improvement to the scenario. Hence, we desist from adopting such a course and adopt eq. (2.5).\n\u03bc\nThe fact that T\u03bd\u03bc needs to be divergenceless (T\u03bd;\u03bc\n= 0) implies\nd\nd\nd\n(\u03c1a3 bD ) + Pa bD a3 + Pb a3 bD = 0 .\ndt\ndt\ndt\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn standard (3-dimensional) cosmology, the constituents of the universe today are dark energy (essentially in\nthe form of a cosmological constant), dark matter and baryons. (The radiation energy density has substantially redshifted and hence, has negligible contribution to the energy density of the universe.) Of these, both\ndark matter and baryons are very well approximated by pressureless matter. Indeed, the nature of the dark\nmatter can be inferred very well as compared to the dark energy. Consequently, we start by assuming that\nthe matter does not exert any pressure in the three visible directions and Pa = 0. On the other hand, in the\nextra dimensions, it does exert a pressure of the form Pb = Pb (\u03c1). Note that this implies that it is a single\nfluid that exerts such an anisotropic pressure. A mechanical analogy would be that of gas molecules filling\na space but constrained to move only along a subspace. We could, of course, have adopted a scenario with\ntwo fluids, each inhabiting a subspace. However, this would only have increased the degrees of freedom\nin the theory without adding qualitatively to our understanding. Hence we desist from doing this, although\nsuch a course of action may well be necessitated when one attempts to construct a microscopic theory.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fThe dark energy is, thus, directly 'visible' only in the extra dimensions. The effect (late time acceleration) in the normal dimensions is through the evolution of extra dimensions. An infinite variety of equation\nof states for this dark energy are possible. For simplicity, we will assume a monomial form, viz. Pb = wb \u03c1\nwith\nw\n(2.7)\nwb = \u03b3 ,\n\u03c1\u0304\nwhere w and \u03b3 are parameters of the model to be chosen so as to reproduce the observational data and \u03c1\u0304 is\ndefined in eq. 3.1. Once again, this choice (reminiscent of a generalized Chaplygin gas [25]) also serves to\nminimize the number of free parameters in the theory.\nThe aforementioned energy momentum tensor governs the evolution of the 1+3+D dimensional spacetime. Let us now consider the Einstein equations, namely\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u03baT\u03bd\u03bc ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwith \u03ba = 8\u03c0G. The '00' component can be expressed as\n\u02272\n\u0227 \u1e03 D(D \u2212 1) \u1e032\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\n+\nD\n+\n=\n.\n(2.9)\n2\n2\na\nab\n6\nb\n3\nSolving for \u0227/a and bringing it to a form close to the familiar form of the FRW equations, we have\ns\n\u02272\n8 \u03c0 G \u03c1 D (2D + 1) \u1e032 D \u1e03 D (D + 2) \u1e032 32 \u03c0 G\u03c1\n+\n(2.10)\n=\n\u2213\n+\na2\n3\n6\nb2\n2 b\n3\nb2\n3\nIn the absence of the last two terms on the R.H.S., this equation would, understandably, reduce to the\nstandard form. In other words, the \u1e03/b dependent terms act as an effective dark energy source1 .\nSince the scale factor, b(t), corresponding to the extra dimensions enters the equations only through\n\u1e03/b (= dlnb/dt), what is relevant for the evolution of a(t) is not the absolute value of b but only the ratio\nby which b(t) changes with time. This is because in our model, spatial curvature in the hidden dimension\nk2 = 0. In other words, it is not the size of the hidden world that matters, but its fractional rate of change\n(compression or expansion). It is this rate of compression of the extra dimensions that effectively acts like a\ndynamical dark energy source for the visible universe. Note that, for a non-zero \u1e03/b, the scale-factor in our\nworld, a(t), evolves non-trivially even in the absence of any matter (\u03c1 = 0). This is not unexpected, because\ngravity does couple the two subspaces and the contraction (expansion) of one can lead to the expansion\n(contraction) of the other. To be specific, \u03c1 = 0 leads to a power-law evolution of the two scale-factors (the\nexponents being determined by D) wherein one of them increases with time and the other decreases.\nAs is well known, usual (1 + 3)-dimensional deSitter cosmologies admit both expanding and contracting solutions. We choose one of the solutions, namely, the expanding one, because we observe that the\nuniverse is expanding and not contracting. The situation here is a little more subtle. As far the '00' component of the Einstein equations goes, there is still a generalized symmetry of the form (\u0227, \u1e03) \u2194 (\u2212\u0227, \u2212\u1e03).\nHowever, as the form of the other components of G\u03bc\u03bd shows, this symmetry is not manifest. A consequence\nof this and the preceding discussion is that a pressureless fluid (even in a higher-dimensional world) would\nnot admit 'late time acceleration', although uniformly accelerating/decelerating solutions are possible[26].\n\n3\n\nCosmological Solutions\n\nThe evolution of the universe is governed by the Einstein equations along with eq. (2.6 & 2.7). Not all of\nthese are independent, though. For example, using the constraint equation (G00 = 8\u03c0G\u03c1) and the continuity\n\u03bc\nequation (T\u03bd;\u03bc\n= 0) we may eliminate b\u0308.

Note that the Einstein equations can only determine A\u2032 (\u03c4 ) and B \u2032 (\u03c4 ) and not the scale factors\nthemselves, a situation exactly analogous to the (1 + 3)-dimensional case. To solve eq. (3.2) for A\u2032 (\u03c4 )\nand \u03c1(\u03c4 ), we require two initial conditions. Since we know the conditions in the present universe relatively\nprecisely, we will prescribe the conditions today. In other words, with \u03c4 = 0 referring to the present epoch,\nwe evolve these equations back in time with the following 'initial' conditions\n\u0227\na\n\n\u03c4 =0\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c1c\n\n\u03c4 =0\n\n= H0 =\u21d2 A\u2032 |\u03c4 =0 = 1\n(3.3)\n=1\n\n=\u21d2 \u03c1\u0304|\u03c4 =0 = 1 .\n\nWe may now numerically solve the two coupled first order differential equations. Two such solutions exist,\none for each sign in the last of eq. (3.2). We reject here the branch with the '\u2212' sign as it leads to an\naccelerated expansion for all times rather than a transition from a decelerated phase to an accelerated one.\nThe model is characterized by three parameters namely D, \u03b3 and w. In figure 1, we present the solutions for the two scale factors for some representative values of these parameters. For ease of comparison,\nwe have rescaled the solutions 2 so that\na|\u03c4 =0 = 1\nb|\u03c4 =0 = 1\n\n=\u21d2\n=\u21d2\n\nA|\u03c4 =0 = 0\nB|\u03c4 =0 = 0 .\n\nWe have a whole class of solutions in which a, the scale factor for our universe starts from 1 at \u03c4 = 0\nand decreases monotonically for negative values of \u03c4 . A word of caution is in place here. Since we have\nneglected radiation completely, the equations are valid only as long as the universe is matter dominated. The\nredshift corresponding to matter-radiation equality is about zeq \u223c 2.9 \u00d7 104 \u03a9m h2 . For the measured values\n2\n\nThis is not to say that the two scale factors are indeed the same in the present epoch, but reflects the fact that the scale factors\nare arbitrary upto a constant.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fof \u03a9m (\u223c 0.27) and h(\u223c 0.72), we have zeq \u223c 3000. In fact, even before we go as far back as z = zeq , the\napproximation breaks down as the radiation density can no longer be neglected. We have checked, though,\nthat the inclusion of the radiation component does not change the evolution drastically for z >\n\u223c zeq . And,\nsince we are primarily interested in the evolution of the universe in relatively recent times, the inclusion of\nradiation does not affect the results in any discernible way.\nAs can be easily discerned, the relative evolution in b(\u03c4 ) is small. In the time interval that a(\u03c4 ) has\nincreased by nearly a factor of 3000, b(\u03c4 ) has decreased by \u223c 29%. While the opposing signs of the\nevolution was predicted even in a matter-free universe (see discussion in the preceding section), the large\ndifference in the magnitude of the evolution is but a consequence of the difference in the pressure exerted\nby matter in the two worlds.\nThe epoch of matter\u2013radiation equality, \u03c4eq \u2261 \u03c4 (z = zeq ), has a considerable dependence on the\nparameter choice. For a given value of D and \u03b3, a smaller w shifts \u03c4eq further into the past [for example,\nwith (D, \u03b3) = (6, 0.59), we have \u03c4eq \u2248 \u22120.95, \u22120.97, \u22120.99 for w = \u22122.58, \u22122.6, \u22122.62] thus increasing\n\n1\n\nq\n\n0.5\n\n0\n(3, -3.10, 0.66)\n(4, -2.62, 0.64)\n(6, -2.80, 0.74)\n(8, -2.50, 0.60)\n\n-0.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nz\n\nFigure 2. Evolution of the deceleration parameter q with the redshift z. The numbers in the parentheses refer to\n(D, w, \u03b3).\n\nthe present-day age of the universe. Similarly, for a given value of D, and w, as we decrease \u03b3, once again \u03c4eq\nshifts further into the past [(D, w) = (6, \u22122.8) leads to \u03c4eq = \u22120.91, \u22120.88, \u22120.86 for \u03b3 = 0.7, 0.72, 0.74].\nNote, though, that the ranges of parameters are restricted (and correlated). An arbitrary set would tend to\ndestroy either late time acceleration or shift \u03c4eq to unacceptable values.\nAs figure 1 shows, the curves for a(\u03c4 ) have a slight upward concavity for \u03c4 >\n\u223c \u22120.3. This is but a\nreflection of late time acceleration. Prior to this epoch, the universe was in a decelerated phase, as attested\nto by the prominent upward convexity at \u03c4 <\n\u223c \u22120.5 . This becomes clearer when we plot the deceleration\nparameter q as a function of the redshift (see figure 2).\n\n4\n\nObservational Constraints\n\nHaving established that the model, for some choice of parameters, does lead to correct late time acceleration,\nwe now seek to confront it with other observational data. The most important such data relates to Type Ia\nsupernovae. The very comprehensive Union2 data set [27] lists the distance modulus \u03bc as well as the redshift\nfor 557 such supernovae. As the distance modulus \u03bc \u2261 5 log dL + 25 is nothing but a rephrasing of the\nluminosity dL (z), defined through\nZz\ndz \u2032\ndL (z) = (1 + z)\n,\n(4.1)\nH(z \u2032 )\n0\n\nwe, then, need to calculate dL (z), given our determination of H(z) for a particular choice of parameters.\nWe define a \u03c72 \u2013test through\n\u03c72 (D, \u03b3, w) =\n\ni=n\nX\n[\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (D, \u03b3, w; zi )]2\n\n\u03c3i2\n\ni=0\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n,\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fwhere \u03bcth defines the value expected in our model for a particular choice of parameters, whereas \u03bcobs and \u03c3\nare the observational value and the associated root-mean-squared error. We may, now, determine the best-fit\nvalue of the parameters by minimizing the \u03c72 . In table 1, we list such best fit values for some choices of D.\nThe results are analogous for other choices. Note that, with an increase in D, both |w| and \u03b3 decrease. This\nis quite understandable as the ensuing smaller extra-dimensional pressures would now have an enhanced\neffect in the normal world owing to the larger effective coupling between \u0227(t) and \u1e03(t). Thus, if we were to\nadmit very large D values, without any concern for the microscopic theory, the fluid would tend to a normal\none.\nD\n2\n3\n6\n10\n35\n100\n\n\u03c72min\n538.92\n539.18\n539.33\n539.42\n539.44\n539.74\n\nw\n\u22123.71+0.25\n\u22120.63\n\u22123.10+0.18\n\u22120.55\n\u22122.50+0.13\n\u22120.47\n\u22122.31+0.12\n\u22120.38\n\u22122.06+0.35\n\u22120.11\n\u22121.98+0.07\n\u22120.38\n\n\u03b3\n0.72+0.23\n\u22120.08\n0.66+0.25\n\u22120.07\n0.59+0.27\n\u22120.06\n0.57+0.14\n\u22120.06\n0.53+0.26\n\u22120.05\n0.51+0.28\n\u22120.05\n\nq0\n\u22120.49+0.10\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.47+0.09\n\u22120.27\n\u22120.44+0.08\n\u22120.29\n\u22120.46+0.08\n\u22120.36\n\u22120.45+0.09\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.43+0.06\n\u22120.30\n\nztr\n0.75+0.23\n\u22120.27\n0.78+0.22\n\u22120.32\n0.77+0.20\n\u22120.31\n0.79+0.19\n\u22120.33\n0.79+0.20\n\u22120.33\n0.80+0.19\n\u22120.34\n\nTable 1.

Rather, for a given D, we consider the \u03b3-w plane as a two-dimensional parameter space. We\nmay, then, attempt to define 95% C.L. contours in this plane by considering \u2206\u03c72 . These are displayed in\nfigure 3. As is evident, there is a strong negative correlation between the two parameters. Note, furthermore,\nthat positive w (hence, positive pressure) is essentially ruled out. Similarly, integral values of \u03b3 are also\nessentially ruled out. Further, this is true even if we consider values of D far larger than those preferred by\nmicroscopic theories of high energy physics. As can be deduced from table 1, each of the marked points in\nfigure 3 denotes essentially a global minimum of \u03c72 , with the position of minima getting increasingly closer\nas one increases D arbitrarily.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fOnce a(\u03c4 ) and, hence, H(z) is determined in a model, one may also calculate both the present deceleration parameter q0 as well as ztr , the redshift corresponding to the epoch of transition from the decelerated\nto the accelerated phase. Note that these values are not uniquely determined by the data alone as the cosmological model has a strong bearing on this determination.

Most models rely on a mysterious type of matter (Dark Energy) which gives an effective repulsive gravity which is supposed to provide the observed\naccelerated expansion. This mysterious source term is perceived only through its effect on cosmological\nexpansion.\nIn this paper, we have followed an approach using higher dimensions. The mysterious behaviour of\nmatter (a la the Dark Energy) is manifested directly only in the extra dimensions. The accelerated expansion\nof the scale factor in normal dimensions is produced only indirectly by the source term through its effect on\nthe extra dimensions. Thus, in our model, the issue of invoking strange properties for the dark energy fluid\ndoes not arise as it exhibits its unusual property only in the extra dimensions.\nThe particularly simple scenario we consider here is able to produce the requisite late time acceleration.\nThe matter content acts as a pressureless gas in the normal dimensions and has a monomial equation of state\nas far as the extra dimensions are concerned. Just this simple ansatz leads to not only a late time acceleration,\nbut also to a very moderate contraction of the extra dimensions since the epoch of radiation-matter equality\nalthough the normal dimensions have expanded by a factor of \u223c 3000 in the same time period. With the\nsize of the extra dimensions hardly changing, the role of any fields confined to the extra-dimensions as also\nthose of any possible Kaluza-Klein towers of the SM fields in the low energy limit has remained essentially\nunaltered in this epoch.\nFor a significantly wide range of parameters, the model shows excellent agreement with the observational data on Type Ia supernovae, as attested to by both a low \u03c72 per degree of freedom as well as the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We still need a negative pressure nonetheless, albeit limited to the extra\ndimensions. Whether a more complicated scenario, involving a non-isotropic extra dimensional subspace\nand/or multiple fluids, obviates this restriction is yet to be seen.\nAn interesting feature of our model is that the present phase of accelerated expansion is, generically, a\ntransient one. In figure 4, we plot q(z) against log10 (1+z). Note that the future is defined by log10 (1+z) <\n0. For example, (D, w, \u03b3) = (2, \u22123.71, 0.72), namely one of our best fit points, the universe will transit to\na decelerating phase at z = \u22120.23. Similarly, for (D, w, \u03b3) = (6, \u22122.80, 0.74), which is somewhat away\nfrom a best fit (but within the 95% C.L region), this transition would occur at z = \u22120.28.\nOne aspect which we have not dwelt with in this paper is the rate of growth of perturbations. While\na detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper and would be addressed elsewhere, let us make a few\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fcomments. With the dynamics presented here being the dominant driving mechanism post matter-radiation\nequality, changes in structure formation would be confined to this epoch. In fact, the quantum of difference\nfrom the \u039b-CDM scenario would be of the same approximate size as in a large class of theories with a\ndynamical Dark Energy source. This is supported by the fact that q0 in this model (see table 1) agrees\n(within error bars) with \u22120.6, the value it assumes in the standard \u039b-CDM scenario. Indeed, a careful\nanalysis of this aspect could prove of value in further narrowing down of the parameter space, with larger D\nbeing less preferred.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the anonymous referee for important suggestions that led to an improvement in the presentation.
