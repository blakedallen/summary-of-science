His father, Joseph Kruskal, owned\nKruskal & Kruskal, which was for many decades the\nnation's largest wholesale fur business. Bill's mother,\nLillian Vorhaus Kruskal, later became famous as Lillian Oppenheimer, founder of what is today called\nOrigami USA, co-authoring books on origami and\nmaking numerous television appearances to promote\nthe art of paperfolding. (She also taught origami at\nsummer camp to Judy Tanur's children.)\nThe three Kruskal brothers all went on to research\ncareers in related fields. \"Bill, Martin and I all started\n\n1\n\nDiscussed in 10.1214/088342306000000358,\n10.1214/088342306000000367, 10.1214/088342306000000376,\n10.1214/088342306000000385, 10.1214/088342306000000394,\n10.1214/088342306000000402 and\n10.1214/088342306000000411.\n\nThis is an electronic reprint of the original article\npublished by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in\nStatistical Science, 2007, Vol. 22, No. 2, 255\u2013261.

Bill was named the Ernest DeWitt\ndimensional scaling, and now retired from Bell Laboratories. Bill's other brother, Martin Kruskal, a\nprofessor emeritus of mathematics at Princeton University and now at Rutgers University, in 1993 received the National Medal of Science, the nation's\nhighest award for scientific achievement.\nBill first attended Antioch College and then transferred to Harvard University, receiving his bachelor's\ndegree in mathematics and philosophy summa cum\nlaude in 1940. He then received his master's degree\nin mathematics from Harvard in 1941 and his Ph.D.\nin mathematical statistics from Columbia University\nin 1955.\nBill was a mathematician at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, from 1941 to 1946,\nand worked for Kruskal & Kruskal from 1946 to Fig. 3. The Kruskal siblings: Bill, Molly, Rosaly, Martin\n1948. He was a lecturer in mathematics at Columbia David and Joe.\n\n\fTHE WILLIAM KRUSKAL LEGACY\n\nFig. 4.\n\n3\n\nWestern Union telegram from Kruskal to Wallis, accepting the initial appointment at the University of Chicago.\n\nBurton Distinguished Service Professor in Statistics\nin 1973. His wide-ranging interdisciplinary research\nand leadership reached across two academic divisions and a professional school at the University of\nChicago over the decades. He was a founding faculty member of the Department of Statistics in the\nPhysical Sciences Division and served as department\nChairman from 1966 to 1973, playing a vital role in\nbuilding the new Department of Statistics and establishing an unusually effective collegiality within\nthe department. He further served the University as\ndean of the Social Sciences Division from 1974 to\n1984, and as dean pro tempore of the newly established Irving B. Harris Graduate School of Public\nPolicy Studies from 1988 to 1989. He retired as professor emeritus in 1990. In separate commentaries,\nStephen Stigler comments on Bill's role within the\ndepartment and Norman Bradburn focuses on Bill's\nrole as a citizen of the university and of the broader\nstatistical and social science community.\nA reference letter dated February 16, 1950 from\nAbraham Wald to W. Allen Wallis, founding chairman of the then Committee on Statistics (which\nlater became the Department of Statistics), included\nthe following comments:\nVery gifted and intelligent. Belongs in the\nupper 5 percent of our graduate students.\nHas a very good mathematical background\n\n(master's degree in mathematics from Harvard). Very well equipped and capable for\ntheoretical work in statistics, but probably more interested in applications. He\nwas at the Naval Proving Ground at\nDahlgren, Virginia during the war and,\ntherefore, had experience in the application of mathematics to practical problems.\nHe is mature, conscientious and industrious and has a pleasant personality. He has\nmade a good beginning on his Ph.D. thesis work. Doubtful whether he can finish\nit by the end of this academic year. Age:\n30 years.\n[Wald died December 13, 1950.] Bill was appointed\noriginally as instructor for a one-year period, October 1, 1950 to September 30, 1951. The formal offer\nletter from Wallis (March 6, 1950) makes no reference to a Ph.D. degree. Bill's acceptance came just\nover a week later by telegram, reproduced here as\nFigure 4.\nBill was appointed an assistant professor for a\nthree-year term as of October 1, 1951 and reappointed on December 14, 1953 for another three-year\nterm. There is no mention of his Ph.D. degree in\nthe proposal letter from Wallis or in the Dean's appointment letter. Bill was a perfectionist and it was\nnot until 1955 that he submitted the final version\nof his thesis and received his Ph.D. (Departments\n\n\f4\n\nS. E. FIENBERG, S. M. STIGLER AND J. M. TANUR\n\nFig. 5. Bill and other statistics faculty with Jerzy Neyman in 1959 on the occasion of Neyman's receipt of an honorary\ndegree from the University of Chicago.\n\nwere then clearly more forgiving of such matters\nthan they are today.) Bill went on leave to Berkeley\nfor the 1955\u20131956 academic year and Wallis initiated\nhis promotion to associate professor with indefinite\ntenure that fall, informing the dean of the threat\nthat Bill might stay at Berkeley. Bill's promotion\nbecame official in December 1956 and took effect on\nOctober 1, 1957.\nBill became editor of The Annals of Mathematical Statistics in 1958 and he served in that capacity\nuntil 1961. This, however, was only the beginning\nof Bill's career as an editor, an activity to which he\nreturned repeatedly throughout his career. He was\npresident of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics\nin 1970\u20131971 and of the American Statistical Association in 1982.\nAlong with senior colleague W. Allen Wallis, Bill\ndevised the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, a now ubiquitous\nrank test for one-way analyses of variance, found\ntoday under that name as part of every major statistical computing package. Their original paper appeared in the Journal of the American Statistical\nAssociation (JASA) in 1952, and it and the test remain widely cited today (see the discussion in\nStigler's accompanying commentary).\nWith another Chicago colleague, Leo Goodman,\nBill co-authored a series of four classic papers that,\n\nreturning to first principles, brought new insight to\nmeasuring the association between pairs of qualitative attributes. These appeared over a 18-year period in JASA, beginning in 1954, and were later republished in book form in 1979. Goodman describes\nsome of their work and interactions in an accompanying commentary. Bill also wrote a separately authored piece in JASA on ordinal measures of association which dovetailed with the Goodman\u2013Kruskal\nwork.\nThroughout this period, Bill worked on and off\non his coordinate-free approach to linear statistical\nmodels. Although he published only three brief papers on the topic, he also developed what became\na legendary set of unpublished class notes elaborating on the ideas. In this work Bill freed statisticians\nfrom relying on vision-clouding coordinate frames of\nreference. Morris Eaton, who was a junior colleague\nto Bill in the late 1960s and early 1970s, describes\nthe impact of this work in an accompanying commentary.\nBill co-authored yet another series of landmark\npapers with Frederick Mosteller in the 1980s on representative sampling. These papers trace the history\nof the notion of probability sampling and describe\nhow it evolved from the \"loose\" and not-well-defined\n\n\fTHE WILLIAM KRUSKAL LEGACY\n\n5\n\nFig. 6. Bill and other statistics faculty with Frederick Mosteller in 1973 on the occasion of Mosteller 's receipt of an honorary\ndegree from the University of Chicago.\n\nnotion of \"representativeness.\" Bill had a fascination\nwith the origins of statistical terminology and ideas.\nThis fascination also is reflected in his work with\nSteve Stigler on the appearance and uses of \"normal\" in statistics (normal equations, normal distribution, with senses of both the usual and the ideal),\nand in Bill's longstanding investigation of the term\nand idea of \"relative importance.\"\nPresident Richard Nixon appointed Bill to his\nPresident's Commission on Federal Statistics in 1970.\nThe 15-member Commission conducted a comprehensive review of the data-gathering and compilation and use of statistics by the federal government,\nthe first such review that had taken place in 20\nyears. The subsequent creation of a permanent committee to address the kinds of problems the President's Commission had laid out (the National Research Council's Committee on National Statistics)\nwas predominantly due to Bill's efforts, and he became its first chairman, serving from 1971 to 1978.\nThe Committee was charged with evaluating statistical issues for the U.S. government, including citizens' attitudes and behavior toward the census. Margaret Martin in an accompanying commentary describes her interactions with Bill as they launched\nthe Committee.\nBill's academic interests were encyclopedic. Indeed, he put these interests to use as the associate\neditor for statistics of the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences from 1962 to 1968, and\n\nco-editor (with Judith Tanur) of the International\nEncyclopedia of Statistics in 1978. His role as editor\nis described by Tanur in her accompanying commentary and also by Stephen Fienberg.\nWhen a statistical issue in an unfamiliar setting\ncaught his eye, Bill would frequently begin a file\nthat would grow over time, as he added the products\nof his library work, correspondence he would initiate with experts in other fields, and clippings from\nhis voracious reading of newspapers, scholarly magazines and professional journals. The topics would\nrange from cloud seeding to casualty counts in the\nVietnam War to the Dreyfus Affair. These files and\nthe careful references to the sources he had encountered added immeasurably to the depth of scholarship of all entries in the encyclopedias he edited.\nEven those contributing authors who in fact never\nread beyond narrow specialties acquired through\nBill's uncredited editorial intervention the appearance of widely read scientific generalists. As several of the commentaries note, Bill's mailing of clippings became a source of amusement, stimulation\nand an occasional prod to action among his varied\ncolleagues, friends and acquaintances.\nBill received many honors over the course of his\ncareer. In 1970\u20131971 he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences\nand NSF Senior Postdoctoral Fellow, and he was\na Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial\nFoundation in 1979\u20131980.
