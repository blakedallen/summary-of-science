[2] first introduce a general mathematical\nsetting for the control, and in particular for the stabilization, of time-delay\nsystems. This mathematical framework was formalized in [3] by the introduction of the B\u00e9zout ring of pseudopolynomials, or independently by [4]\nwith a behavioral approach. In these works, distributed delays appear in\nthe stabilization problem. More generally, they are at the core in spectrum\nassignment by feedback [5]. Finite spectrum assignment generalizes the principle of Smith's predictor for dead-time systems [6] to more general systems\nwith delays, which can be stable or unstable. Distributed delays appear also\nin the characterization of equivalence transformations [7]. Robustness issue\nand optimization [8], robustness for input-delay systems [9] or finite time\ncontrol [10] are other topics where distributed delays play a central role.\nA distributed delay is a linear input-output convolution operator of the form\nZ \u03b8\ny(t) = (f \u2217 u)(t) =\nf (\u03c4 )u(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n(1)\n0\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a strictly positive and finite real, and kernel f (*) is a continuous\nfunction with support [0, \u03b8]. Numerical implementation of distributed delay\nwas early investigated, to propose effective algorithms for control. Such an\nimplementation was the starting point of a widely research activity. A first\nproposition for approximation with finite dimensional systems was proposed\nin [11]. Reduction and approximation of delay systems, involving lumped\ndelays, were also investigated in [12]. In the work of [13], the authors propose a numerical integral approximation to realize an operator like in (1).\nSuch an approximation writes as a sum of lumped delayed distributions,\nand unfortunately introduces additional closed-loop poles, and also instability phenomena. See, e.g. [14], [15], and references therein. To overcome\nthis problem, various solutions were proposed. In [16], it was outlined that\nsuch an approximation has a poor accuracy and an high sensitivity for high\nfrequencies. Hence, the author proposed to add a low-pass filter in the integral approximation. Such a solution was also proposed indepedently by [17].\nFurther implementation improvements were proposed in [18], with rational\napproximation and extension of bilinear transformations. These last papers\ngive positive answers to the open problem of general approximation of distributed delays, outlined in [19].\nWe propose in this paper a general methodology for numerical implementation of distributed delays. The numerical implementation of an operator\n2\n\n\fexhibit two sides. The first one involves time discretization of the inputoutput behavior of the operator. Any distributed delay is a BIBO-stable\noperator. It is easy to verify that an equivalent discrete time system can be\nobtained by usual sampling tools, and that this system can be put into a sum\nof causal lumped distributions. Taking an appropriate sampling period, this\nequivalent discrete time system can always be made BIBO-stable. Hence, this\nfirst part presents no difficulty. We refer for instance to [20] and in references\ntherein for more details on this part. The second part involves the approximation problem in continuous time of such an operator. This is this part we\naddress in this paper. A continuous time approximation need to reproduce\nwith high fidelity the internal dynamics of this operator, for large classes of\ninput signals, but also to generate an arbitrarily close input-output behavior to the original one. For linear systems governed by a convolution, these\nnotions are equivalent to impose simultaneous time and frequency approximations. For this, we explicitly separate two notions, namely input-output\napproximation and kernel approximation. We will explain why input-output\napproximation is not suitable for approximation of distributed delays, and we\nwill then focus ourselves on kernel approximation. Kernel approximation can\nbe realized in many different ways. Among most used classes of operators for\napproximation, we can cite polynomials, rational fractions, or exponentials.\nSee, e.g. [21], [22], or [23].\nWith the objective to substitute the distributed delay by a more tractable\nsystem, highlighting rational assumptions, we propose two classes to realize\napproximation, namely lumped systems and a subclass of distributed delays. With previous objectives, we enclose the approximation problem into\nthe Wiener algebra of BIBO-stable systems, using the graph topology. This\ncorresponds to the weakest topology where feedback is a robust property.\nMoreover, for stable systems, graph topology and norm topology being the\nsame, we work on norm convergence over this algebra, which is a Banach\nalgebra. This general framework was used first in [24] for approximation of\ndistributed parameter systems by lumped systems. Roughly speaking, working over this algebra, an approximation comes down to realize approximation\nof the kernel over the Banach algebra L1 (R+ ). This idea also grew in [25],\nfor the approximation of lumped delayed distributions which appear in optimal control. Here, we propose an extension of the classes of approximates,\nand we show that working in this general setting yields to approximate a\ndistributed delay in both time and frequency domains, for large classes of\n3\n\n\finput signals. We also propose to highlight the propositions made in [16]\nor [17], and to bring a mathematical foundation for this solution.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define and fully characterize the main properties, in both time and frequency domains, of distributed delays. We characterize in particular a general decomposition of\ndistributed delays on the so-called elementary distributed delays. In Section 3, we explicit our approximation problem, and solve it. This section\nstarts with general comments on approximation, where graph topology is\nbriefly recalled, and where we show that any distributed delay can be approximated over this topology by lumped systems. Then, we move to another\nclass of approximates, using a subclass of distributed delays, easy to implement with stability. We show a density property of this subclass, and analyze\nthe convergence of the approximation which is proposed. Section 4 relates\nthe properties of such an approximation. We outline a proposal for a constructive approximation, and analyze time and frequency properties. A few\nsimulation show the effectiveness of the method, on the stabilization control\nproblem.\n2. Convolution operators and distributed delays\n2.1. Convolution algebra\nAn input-output causal convolution system is a dynamical system described by an equation of the form\nZ t\ny(t) = (f \u2217 u)(t) =\nf (\u03c4 )u(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n(2)\n0\n\nwhere y(*), u(*) and f (*) are said to be the output, input and kernel of the\nmap, respectively. Convolution systems are naturally defined over a commutative algebra since they are closed under addition, multiplication and scalar\nmultiplication, operations that correspond to arbitrary series and parallel interconnections of such systems. For a normed algebra, it is quite interesting\nto obtain some closure properties for convergence. Hence, we prefer to work\non a Banach algebra, that is an algebra for which any convergent sequence\nof elements in the algebra has a limit in the algebra, and for which the norm\nhas the multiplicativity property. It will be assumed that all linear spaces\nand algebras are over the complex field. A general algebra of distributions\n\n4\n\n\fincluding a wide class of convolution systems is given by the so-called Callier\nand Desoer algebra, denoted A [26]. We say that f \u2208 A if\n\u001a\nfa (t) + fpa (t), t \u2265 0\nf (t) =\n(3)\n0,\nt<0\nwhere the complex-valued function fa (*) \u2208 L1 (R+ ), that Ris fa is a complex\n\u221e\nvalued function, locally integrable on R+ , and such that 0 |fa (t)| dt < \u221e.\nThe complex-valued distribution fpa stands for the purely atomic part and\nwrites\n\u221e\nX\nfn \u03b4(t \u2212 tn ),\n(4)\nfpa (t) =\nn=0\n\nwith fn \u2208 C, n = 0, 1, . . ., 0 = t0 < t1 <Pt2 < . . ., \u03b4(t \u2212 tn ) denotes the Dirac\ndelta distribution centered in tn , and n\u22650 |fn | < \u221e. As shown in Desoer\nand Vidyasagar [27], it is well known that A is a commutative convolution\nBanach algebra with norm defined by\nkf kA = kfa kL1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n|fn |,\n\n(5)\n\nn=0\n\nand with unit element the Dirac delta distribution \u03b4. Denoting f\u02c6 the Laplace\ntransform of f , A\u02c6 denotes the set of Laplace transforms of elements in A .\nThe set A\u02c6 is also a commutative Banach algebra with unit element under\npointwise addition and multiplication, for the norm\nkf\u02c6kA\u02c6 = kf kA ,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 A .\n\nThe algebra A gives a general mathematical framework for the analysis of\ndistributed delays, as it will be explained in the next subsection. Before this,\nlet us recall the concept of Bounded Input-Bounded Output stability [27].\nDefinition 1. A convolution system in the form (2) is said to be BIBO\nstable if f \u2208 A .\nMore generally, we may be interested by Lp -stability, for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. We say\nthat (2) is Lp -stable if for any u(*) \u2208 Lp (R+ ), that is u(*) locally integrable\nover R+ and\n\u00131/p\n\u0012Z\np\n|u(t)| dt\n< \u221e,\nkukLp =\nR+\n\n5\n\n\fthe output y(*) is also in Lp (R+ ). Since\nkykLp = kf \u2217 ukLp \u2264 kf kA kukLp ,\n\n(6)\n\nLp -stability is equivalent to BIBO stability [27].\n2.2. Distributed delays\nLet Ia,b = [a, b] be the bounded closed interval in R+ , for some reals a\nand b, 0 \u2264 a < b. Notations I0,\u221e or R+ stand for [0, \u221e[. We define K (Ia,b )\nas the set of complex valued functions g(*) of the form\n\u001a\ngIa,b (t), t \u2208 Ia,b\n(7)\ng(t) =\n0,\nelsewhere\nwhere\ngIa,b (t) =\n\nXX\n\ncij tj e\u03bbi t ,\n\n(8)\n\ni\u22650 j\u22650\n\nfor some cij and \u03bbi in C, and the sums are finite. In other words, gIa,b is\na finite linear combination of exponential-polynomials type functions, and\nit is in particular a continuous function. For any real valued function in\nK (Ia,b ), if some \u03bbi \u2208 C appears in the sum, then so does its conjugate \u03bb\u0304i ,\nand the associated coefficients cij are complex conjugates. Hence, any real\nvalued function in K (Ia,b ) is a function generated by real linear combinations\nof tj e\u03c3i t , tj e\u03c3i t sin(\u03b2k t) and tj e\u03c3i t cos(\u03b2k t), for some real numbers \u03c3i , \u03b2k , the\nsums being finite. The formal definition of distributed delay is made below.\nDefinition 2. A distributed delay is a causal convolution system, with kernel f in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ), for some bounded real numbers 0 \u2264 \u03b81 < \u03b82 .\nIn other words, a distributed delay can be written like an input-output convolution operator of the form\nZ \u03b82\nfI\u03b81 ,\u03b82 (\u03c4 )u(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 ,\n(9)\ny(t) = (f \u2217 u)(t) =\n\u03b81\n\nwith notations introduced in (8). The set of distributed delays, denoted by\nG , is a ring. Obviously, for real valued signals, the kernel f (*) will be a\nreal valued function in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ). In the previous definition, we restrict ourselves to define a distributed delay like a convolution operator with kernel in\nK (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ). This restriction is not conservative as we will show in Section 3.2.\n6\n\n\fActually, all distributed delays which appeared in the literature are particular cases of this definition. This definition is based on a rational construction,\nas this appears explicitly using Laplace transforms. Any distributed delay G\nadmits a Laplace transform, corresponding to the finite Laplace transform of\nits kernel f \u2208 K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ),\nZ \u03b82\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u0177(s) = f (s)\u00fb(s), f (s) =\nfI\u03b81 ,\u03b82 (\u03c4 ) e\u2212s\u03c4 d\u03c4 ,\n(10)\n\u03b81\n\nwhere f\u02c6 \u2208 G\u02c6 is an entire function, i.e. holomorphic on the whole complex\nplane. The notion of elementary distributed delay will greatly simplify the\napproximation problem. Let us define the complex valued function \u03b8\u03bb (*) \u2208\nK (I0,\u03b8 ), for some \u03bb \u2208 C and \u03b8 > 0, by\n\u001a \u03bbt\ne , t \u2208 [0, \u03b8]\n\u03b8\u03bb (t) =\n(11)\n0,\nelsewhere\nand its Laplace transform\n\u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) =\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(s\u2212\u03bb)\u03b8\n,\ns\u2212\u03bb\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is an entire function even in s = \u03bb where \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (\u03bb) = \u03b8. In other words, \u03bb is\na removable singularity, and consequently \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) has no pole. The distributed\ndelay whose kernel is \u03b8\u03bb is called an elementary distributed delay. The kth\n(k)\nderivative \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) of \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) yields\nZ \u03b8\n(k)\n\u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) =\n(\u2212\u03c4 )k e\u2212(s\u2212\u03bb)\u03c4 d\u03c4 ,\n(13)\n0\n\nwhich is still in G\u02c6, and corresponds to the Laplace transform of the function\n\u03b8\u03bbk (t) = (\u2212t)k e\u03bbt for t \u2208 [0, \u03b8], and 0 elsewhere. From previous definitions,\nwe can state the following lemma, which also appeared in [28] using 2Dpolynomials, and which will play a central role for approximation.\nLemma 1. Any element in G\u02c6 can be decomposed into a finite sum of Laplace\ntransform of elementary distributed delays and its successive derivatives.\nProof. Take any element in G . Its kernel g(*) lies in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ), and writes\nas in (8). By time translation corresponding to the lumped delay \u03b81 , it is\nreadily a linear finite combination of elementary distributed delays \u03b8\u03bb (t) and\nof the functions \u03b8\u03bbk (t), as defined in (11) and (13), with \u03b8 = \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 .\n\u2737\n7\n\n\fIn other terms, previous result tells us that for any \u011d \u2208 G\u02c6, there exist complex\npolynomials \u011dik \u2208 C[e\u2212\u03b8s ] with respect to the variable e\u2212\u03b8s and \u03bbi \u2208 C, in\nfinite number, such that\nX\n(k)\n\u011d(s) =\n\u011dik (e\u2212\u03b8s )\u03b8\u0302\u03bbi (s),\n(14)\ni,k\n\nwhere successive derivatives are iteratively computed by\nP\nn\n\u2212(s\u2212\u03bbi )\u03b8\n\u2212 kn=1 \u03b8n! e\u2212(s\u2212\u03bbi )\u03b8 (s \u2212 \u03bbi )n\n(k)\nk 1\u2212e\n\u03b8\u0302\u03bbi (s) = (\u22121) k!\n,\n(s \u2212 \u03bbi )k+1\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(15)\n\nk k+1\n\n\u03b8\n, for any k \u2265 0.\nand \u03b8\u0302\u03bbi (s) are still entire functions, since \u03b8\u0302\u03bbi (\u03bbi ) = (\u22121)k+1\nFrom (14) and taking into account that practical distributed delay is a real\nvalued operator, we see that, grouping the terms via least common multiple,\nany element \u011d \u2208 G\u02c6 can be put into a fraction\n\n\u011d(s) =\n\nn(s, e\u2212\u03b8s )\n,\nd(s)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere n(s, e\u2212\u03b8s ) \u2208 R[s, e\u2212\u03b8s ] is a real quasipolynomial with respect to the\nalgebraically independent variables s and e\u2212\u03b8s , and d(s) \u2208 R[s]. Any element\nin the right hand side of (14) being an entire function, \u011d(s) is also an entire\nfunction. Hence, any zero of d(s) is also a zero of n(s, e\u2212\u03b8s ). Furthermore, the\n(k)\ndegree with respect to s of \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) in (12) and (15), for any k, being strictly\nnegative, the degree with respect to s of \u011d(s) satisfies degs n < degs d, so\nthat its Laplace transform is strictly proper. As in [3], the ring G\u02c6 is the\nring of those Laplace transforms of distributed delays that are rational in\nthe variable s and e\u2212\u03b8s , which are entire and strictly proper (with respect\nto s). This result comes from the assumption on rational kernels in (8).\nThe kernel of any element in G is obviously in L1 (R+ ), so that from (6)\nand the definition of A , any distributed delay is BIBO stable. Convolution\nof two kernels with finite support yields another kernel with finite support,\nand since exponential-polynomials type functions are closed under classical\nproduct, we have in fact that G is a normed subalgebra of A for the k * kA norm. From these definitions and properties, we are now able to formulate\nthe approximation problem of distributed delays.\n\n8\n\n\f3. Approximation of distributed delays\nFor this purpose, we define two subspaces in direct sum in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ),\ndenoted respectively Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) and Ku (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ), consisting of linear combinations of exponential-polynomials type functions on some finite interval as\nin (8), with Re \u03bbi < 0 and Re \u03bbi \u2265 0, respectively, for all i \u2265 0.\nFrom Lemma 1 and (14), we know that any element g \u2208 Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) is a linear\ncombination of elements \u03b8\u03bbki in Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ), for which Re \u03bbi < 0. Hence, any\nelement in Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) can be numerically implemented with stability using elementary blocks, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for \u03b8\u03bb (t). Note that in practice, since\n\u03bb \u2208 C, we should implement it using a real decomposition. Approximation\nfor the subclass Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) of distributed delays is not required, since this\nimplementation is realized with stability, and requires, from an implementation point of view, only two pointwise delays, namely 0 and \u03b8. However, this\nis no more true for elements in Ku (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ), where numerical realization for\n\u03b8\u03bb (t) as in Fig. 1 yields to an unstable system. Note that another realization\nfor \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) may be\n\u1e8b(t) = \u03bbx(t) + u(t) \u2212 e\u03bb\u03b8 u(t \u2212 \u03b8),\nwhich is however still numerically unstable for Re \u03bb \u2265 0. Intuitively, this\ninstability is a consequence of a non exact numerical cancellation of the\nremovable singularity s = \u03bb of \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s). Therefore, we will focus our attention\non distributed delays whose kernels are in Ku (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ).\n\u00fb\n\n+\n\u2212\n\ne\u03bb\u03b8\n\n1\ns\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u0177\n\ne\u2212\u03b8s\n\nFigure 1: Realization of an element \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) \u2208 Ks (I0,\u03b8 ), with Re \u03bb < 0.\n\nThe question can now be stated as follows: How to define a continuous time\napproximation of a distributed delay whose kernel lies in Ku (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 )? We\ngive complete answers to this question in the next two subsections. We start\nby some general remarks on approximation over A , and hence give answers\nto the previous question.\n\n9\n\n\f3.1. General comments on approximation\nAny distributed delay with kernel f \u2208 K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) is a convolution operator. Its L\u221e -induced norm is\nkf kA = kf kL1 .\nFrom (6), we see that this norm is actually an upper bound of all its induced\nLp -norms, for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. A natural metric is then obtained from the\nA -norm, which in turn can be enclosed in the graph topology. Consider a\ndistribution p with a coprime factorization (n, d) in A, that is p\u0302 = n\u0302d\u02c6\u22121 , and\nsuch that there exist x and y in A satisfying\nn \u2217 x + d \u2217 y = \u03b4,\n\n(17)\n\n\u02c6 = 1, \u2200s \u2208 C, Re s \u2265 0.\nn\u0302x\u0302 + d\u0177\n\n(18)\n\nor in the Laplace domain\n\nA neighbourhood of p in the graph topology is the set of all plants of the\nform n\u2206 d\u22121\n\u2206 where (n\u2206 , d\u2206 ) belongs to some ball in A centered at (n, d). If p\nis itself in A , for any positive number r, a neighbourhood of p in the graph\ntopology writes\nB(p, r) = {p\u2206 \u2208 A : kp \u2212 p\u2206 kA \u2264 r}.\nIn [29, Ch. 7], it was shown that the graph topology is the weakest topology in which feedback stability is a robust property. Graph topology being\nmetrizable and hence first-countable, for BIBO-stable systems, norm topology and graph topology are the same. Let \u03b5 be a given suitable small positive\nnumber. Hence, we say that a distribution p\u03b5 in A is an approximation of p\nin the graph topology if the element p\u03b5 is close to p, that is p\u03b5 \u2208 B(p, \u03b5), or\nequivalently kp \u2212 p\u03b5 kA \u2264 \u03b5. This property can be related to convergence in\nA , but we need first to define the class of operators that will approximate p\nin the graph topology. The most commonly used class is the so-called class\nof lumped systems, which consists in convolution operators whose kernels lie\nin the set Q, defined by\nQ = {g \u2208 A : g(t) = g0 \u03b4(t) + ga (t), g0 \u2208 C, ga \u2208 Ks (I0,\u221e )} .\n\n10\n\n(19)\n\n\fFrom [24], we know that any plant p with coprime factorization (n, d) over\nA can be approximated by a lumped plant in the graph topology if and only\nif there exists a real constant matrix M of rank 1 such that\n\u0014 \u0015\nn\nMSpa = 0, where Spa = pa ,\n(20)\ndpa\nand (*)pa denotes the purely atomic part. Distributed delays having strictly\nproper transfer functions, we are interested for approximation with the class\nof strictly proper lumped systems, denoted Qs , set of elements in Ks (I0,\u221e ).\nSuch elements satisfy ordinary differential equations, and are easily simulated. From [23], we know that the closure of Qs is L1 (R+ ), since every\nfunction in L1 (R+ ) can be approximated by a sum of exponentials. This\nyields the following result, that can be seen as a particular case of the above\ngiven condition (20).\nTheorem 1. Any plant in L1 (R+ ) can be approximated by a lumped system\nin the graph topology.\nProof. Let f be an element in L1 (R+ ). A coprime factorization of f over\nA is n = f and d = \u03b4. Since npa = 0, any real constant matrix M = [0 \u22c6],\n(\u22c6) denoting an arbitrary real number, satisfies (20). Hence, from [24, Th.\n4.1], f can be approximated by a lumped system in the graph topology. \u2737\nNote that if the element f in L1 (R+ ) is strictly proper, then an approximation in the graph topology realized by a lumped system will be in fact\nin the set Qs . Any convolution system whose kernel lies in L1 (R+ ) can be\napproximated by a lumped system. Roughly speaking, since any distributed\ndelay is a strictly proper fraction and is BIBO-stable, we know that it can\nbe approximated in the graph topology by a strictly proper lumped system.\nCorollary 1. Any distributed delay can be approximated by a lumped system\nin the graph topology.\nOthers approximation classes can be used to numerically realize a distributed\ndelay. In the literature, appears a method based on a numerical integral approximation, but such a method was shown to be at the core of various undesired results, like instability or numerical sensitivity. Let us briefly make some\n11\n\n\fconsiderations on such approximations, introducing what we called inputoutput approximation, and let us show why such approximations are not\nsuitable for our problem. For any distributed delay y(t) = (f \u2217 u)(t), we say\nthat yapp is an Lp input-output approximation of y, if for some arbitrarily\n\u03b5 > 0, ky \u2212 yapp kLp \u2264 \u03b5 holds. For instance, consider the L\u221e input-output\napproximation based on integral approximation, like Newton-Cotes quadrature methods, which leads to an approximation yapp (t) of the form\nyapp (t) =\n\nq\nX\n\nck f (\u03c4k )u(t \u2212 \u03c4k ),\n\n(21)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere reals ck and \u03c4k depend on the applied method [30, Ch. 4]. Various\nproblems arise with this kind of approximation. First note that such an approximation is made for a given u(*). Hence, if such an input changes, the\nproperties of this approximation failed, in general. Note also that, as mentioned by [16], the Laplace transform of (21) yields to an input-output approximation transfer function that is proper, since it contains only pointwise\ndelays. From (14) and (16), a distributed having a strictly proper transfer\nfunction, this approximation has a poor accuracy for high frequencies, which\nwill have as consequence a high sensitivity to high-frequency plant uncertainties, in particular for the closed-loop system. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 2,\nwhere a frequency diagram of \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s) and an input-output approximation is\nplotted. This negative result is directly interpretable in the graph topology\nby the following result.\nTheorem 2. Any distributed delay can not be approximated in the graph\ntopology by a purely atomic distribution.\nProof. Consider an element in G with kernel g. Then g \u2208 L1 (R+ ). Consider an arbitrary purely atomic distribution with pointwise delays of the\nform\nX\np(t) =\npi \u03b4(t \u2212 ti )\ni\u22650\n\nP\n\nwhere i\u22650 |pi | < \u221e. Such a distribution corresponds to the kernel of the\napproximation using numerical integral approximation like in (21). Then\nX\n|pi |.\nkg \u2212 pkA = kgkL1 +\ni\u22650\n\n12\n\n\f0\n\u221210\n\nGain(h(w)/db\n\n\u221220\n\u221230\n\u221240\n\u221250\n\u221260\n\u221270\n\u221280\n0\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nw\n\nFigure 2: Bode gain diagram of \u03b8\u03021 (s) and an approximation based on integral approximation (trapezoidal Newton-Cotes method with 30 nodes).\n\nHence kg \u2212 pkA \u2265 kgkL1 , and consequently p can not approximate g in the\ngraph topology.\n\u2737\nIt is clear that input-output approximation is not suitable for numerical\nimplementation. This was illustrated in [13], [14], or [16]. Hence we focus\nour attention to the notion of approximation defined in the graph topology.\nThis approximation is equivalent to realize an approximation of the kernel of\nthe convolution, so we may also call it kernel approximation, to discern with\nrespect to input-output approximation.\n3.2. Kernel approximations\nApproximation in the graph topology for an element f in Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) requires to find, for some given \u03b5 > 0, an element fapp , defined in general in\nA , such that fapp \u2208 B(f, \u03b5). Element f being in particular in L1 (R+ ),\nadding purely atomic part in approximation can not improve approximation,\nso we realize it over the Banach algebra L1 (R+ ). Indeed, if an approximation\nwrites\napp\nfapp = faapp + fpa\n,\napp\nwhere faapp and fpa\nstand for the atomic and purely atomic parts of fapp ,\nrespectively, the following decomposition holds\napp\nkf \u2212 fapp kA = kf \u2212 faapp kA + kfpa\nkA .\n\n13\n\n\fThe purely atomic part of the approximation is in an independent sum, and\ncan then be reduced to zero to reduce the approximation error. We have\nseen that an approximation can be obtained by lumped systems, with rational and stable transfer functions. Since we want to obtain an approximation\nwhich is global with respect to the time, we are interested in uniform convergent sequence of functions in L1 (R+ ) to f . Consider a sequence fn of\nfunctions which uniformly converges to f , that is, for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists\nn in N such that for any \u03ba \u2265 n, kf \u2212 f\u03ba kA \u2264 \u03b5. So, for any \u03ba \u2265 n, f\u03ba is a\nkernel approximation of f in the graph topology. We propose next a method\nto approximate an element in Ku (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) by elements in Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ). Since\nthese last elements are easily implementable, this will give us an effective\napproximation. In other words, we approximate a distributed delay by another distributed delays. We start by considering the case of an elementary\ndistributed delay.\nLemma 2. Any distributed delay with kernel \u03b8\u03bb (*) in Ku (I0,\u03b8 ) can be approximated by distributed delays with kernels in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ) for the graph topology.\nProof. Let \u03b8\u03bb (*) be the kernel of an elementary distributed delay, with\nRe \u03bb \u2265 0. Let \u03bc \u2208 C such that Re \u03bc = \u03b1 < 0. We define the transform\n\u0398\u03bb (s) = (\u03b1s)\u22121 \u03b8\u03bb (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 ln s),\n\ne\u2212\u03b8\u03b1 \u2264 s \u2264 1.\n\n(22)\n\nThe function \u0398\u03bb (*) is continuous over [e\u2212\u03b8\u03b1 , 1], and we have\nk\u0398\u03bb kL1 = k\u03b8\u03bb kA .\n\n(23)\n\nBy M\u00fcntz-Sz\u00e1sz theorem, we see that \u0398\u03bb (*) can be approximated with respect\nto L1 -norm, as closed as desired, by a function of the form\n\u0398\u03bb,app (s) = (\u03b1s)\u22121 \u03a8\u03bb,app (s),\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03a8\u03bb,app is a polynomial in s. Since norms are preserved in (23), this\ncomes down to approximate \u03b8\u03bb as closely as we please, using inverse transform\nof (22), by a sum of exponentials of the form\n\u03c8\u03bb,app (t) = \u03a8\u03bb,app (e\u2212\u03b1t ),\nwhich is clearly an element in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ).\n14\n\n\u2737\n\n\fIn other words, an approximation of \u03b8\u03bb in A can be a function of the form\n\u03c8\u03bb,n (t) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b3i,n \u03b8\u03b1i (t),\n\n(25)\n\ni=1\n\nwith \u03b1i \u2208 C, Re \u03b1i < 0 some arbitrarily complex numbers, and \u03b3i,n some\nsuitable constants. The order of the approximation n describes the number\nof parallel distributed elements to be added, to get the desired approximation accuracy. Such an approximation does not increase the degree of the\nelementary distributed delay, since it is a sum of distributed delays which\nare strictly proper and have same degree than \u03b8\u0302\u03bb (s). From the synthesis\nof an approximation for the elementary distributed delay, we show in the\nnext two results that it allows to construct an explicit approximation for any\ndistributed delay.\nLemma 3. Let \u03c8\u03bb,n be an element in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ) \u2229 B(\u03b8\u03bb , \u03b5), for a given \u03b5 > 0,\nk\nand k in N. Then \u03c8\u03bb,n\n\u2208 Ks (I0,\u03b8 ) \u2229 B(\u03b8\u03bbk , \u03b8k \u03b5), where\n\u001a\n(\u2212t)k \u03c8\u03bb,n (t) , t \u2208 [0, \u03b8]\nk\n.\n\u03c8\u03bb,n (t) =\n0,\nelsewhere\nProof. Let \u03b5 > 0, and take \u03c8\u03bb,n an element in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ) \u2229 B(\u03b8\u03bb , \u03b5), that is\n\u03c8\u03bb,n (t) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b3i,n \u03b8\u03b1i (t),\n\ni=1\n\nwith \u03b3i,n in C, and k\u03b8\u03bb \u2212 \u03c8\u03bb,n kA \u2264 \u03b5.

Note that we particularize\nthe proofs of previous results with approximations with kernels in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ),\nbut they can be trivially extended to others approximations over A . Previous results state that from the approximation of the elementary distributed\ndelay, we can realize a kernel approximation in the graph topology for any\ndistributed delay in G . Previous results state that, for any f \u2208 K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 )\nand \u03b5 > 0, there exists an element fapp \u2208 Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) such that\nkf \u2212 fapp kA \u2264 \u03b5.\n\n(26)\n\nSaid differently, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. The set Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) is dense in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) for the graph topology.\nProof. Obvious from Lemma 1 and Theorem 3.\n\n\u2737\n\nIn the proof of Lemma 2, convergence of polynomial approximation is uniform, so we get here a uniform convergence of this approximation. The\nassumption that kernel of distributed delay lie in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) is not restrictive.\nIndeed, if this is not the case, any continuous function g in [\u03b81 , \u03b82 ] can be\napproximated with respect to L1 -norm as close as we please by a function in\nK (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) [23]. Previous results addressed the approximation of distributed\ndelays using kernels in Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ), which is based on uniform convergence of\npolynomials to any continuous function over I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 . Other approximation can\nbe proposed. Indeed, any element f in K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ) can also be uniformly approximated by stepwise continuous functions in L1 (I0,\u221e ). This can be seen\nas a particular case of the previous approximation. For this, consider\n\u03b8\u03bb,app (t) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b3i \u03c8(t \u2212 ti ),\n\n(27)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere ti =\n\ni\u03b8\n,\nn\n\nk\u03b8\u03bb \u2212 \u03b8\u03bb,app kA\n\nand \u03c8(*) is a function in Ks (I0,\u221e ). Then\n=\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8\n\n|\u03b8\u03bb (t) \u2212 \u03b8\u03bb,app (t)| dt +\n\n0\nn\u22121 Z (k+1) \u03b8\nX\nn\nk=0\n\nk\u03b8\nn\n\n|\u03b8\u03bb (t) \u2212\n\nk\nX\ni=0\n\n17\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n|\u03b8\u03bb,app (t)| dt\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b3i \u03c8(t \u2212 ti )| dt +\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u221e\n\n|\u03b8\u03bb,app (t)| dt.\n\n\fFrom Lemma 2, we see that approximation (27) uniformly converges to \u03b8\u03bb (*)\nin the graph topology by a suitable choice of coefficients \u03b3i . Taking \u03c8(t) =\ne\u2212\u03b1t h(t), where \u03b1 > 0 and h(*) stands for the Heaviside function, we obtain\nas a particular case the result obtained in [16], and separately in [17], where\na low pass filter is added in the integral approximation with lumped delayed\ndistributions. Indeed, Laplace transform of (27) is of the required form\nn\n\n1 X\n\u03b8\u0302\u03bb,app (s) =\n\u03b3i e\u2212sti\ns + a i=0\nfor a > 0. Coefficients \u03b3i can be obtained for instance from some numerical\nintegral approximation, to guarantee approximation over A , or equivalently\nover L1 (I0,\u221e ).\n4. Discussion on approximation\nWe particularize in this section a proposal for approximation, and we\nanalyze the main properties of the error in the time and frequency domains.\nThese properties will be still valid for any other approximation in the graph\ntopology over A .\n4.1. Proposal for a constructive approximation\nWe propose in this subsection an effective and constructive approximation\nusing elements in Ks (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ). We start this proposal by the particular case\nn!\n, \u03c80 (\u03be) = \u03b80 (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 ln \u03be), for \u03be \u2208]0, 1], and\nof \u03b80 (*). We denote Ckn = k! (n\u2212k)!\n\u03c80 (0) = 0.\nLemma 4. Consider the sequence \u03b80,n (*) in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ) described by\n\u03b80,n (t) =\n\nn\nX\nk=0\n\nCkn\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nk \u2212\u03b1kt\ne\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1t )n\u2212k , t \u2208 I0,\u03b8\n\u03c80\nn\n\nand 0 elsewhere. Then \u03b80,n (*) uniformly converges to \u03b80 (*) for the A -norm.\nProof. Define\n\u03c80 (\u033a) = \u03b80 (\u2212\u03b1\u22121 ln \u033a),\n\n\u033a \u2208]0, 1],\n\n(28)\n\nand \u03c80 (0) = 0. The function \u03c80 (*) has a bounded step discontinuity for\n\u033a = e\u2212\u03b1\u03b8 . Since e\u2212\u03b1\u03b8 is irrational, there exists \u03ba in 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 such that\n18\n\n\f\u03ba/n < e\u2212\u03b1\u03b8 < (\u03ba + 1)/n. We take \u03c80,c (*) any continuous function over [0, 1]\nsatisfying\n\u03c80,c (\u033a) = \u03c80 (\u033a), \u033a \u2208 [0, \u03ba/n] \u222a [(\u03ba + 1)/n, 1],\nthat will remove this discontinuity and will be close as desired to \u03c80 (*) for\nthe L1 (I0,1 )-norm. In particular \u03c80,c (*) will satisfy\n\u03c80,c (k/n) = \u03c80 (k/n), k = 0, 1, . . . , n.\nWe now approximate as close as we please the function \u03c80,c (or equivalently\n\u03c80 ) by Bernstein polynomials\n\u03c80,app (\u033a) =\n\nn\nX\nk=0\n\nCkn\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nk\n\u03c80\n\u033ak (1 \u2212 \u033a)n\u2212k .\nn\n\nBy the inverse transform of (28), we obtain\n\u03b80,n (t) = \u03c80,app (e\u2212\u03b1t ),\nwhich is in Ks (I0,\u03b8 ) since \u03c80 (0) = 0. Furthermore, from Lemma 2, we know\nthat \u03b80,n (*) converges uniformly, by construction, to \u03b80 (*).\n\u2737\nPrevious lemma gives an approximation of \u03b80 in B(\u03b80 , \u03b5n ), where positive\nupper bound \u03b5n can be reduced arbitrarily when n increases. This algorithm\ncan be easily generalized to approximations in K (I0,\u221e ) or of the form (27),\nby modifying the domain of definition for (28). For the more general case of\n\u03b8\u03bb (*), we propose the following constructive solution.\nLemma 5.

With\nLemma 4 and approximation of \u03b80 (*), such an approximation is defined over\nKs (I0,\u03b8 ), and writes like in (25). Some basic considerations can be made\non the order of this approximation. We know from [21] or [22] that, given\n\u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b7 such that for any \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 \u2208 [0, 1], |\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 | \u2264 \u03b7 implies\n\u03b5\n, and that\n|\u03a6\u03bb (\u03bc1 ) \u2212 \u03a6\u03bb (\u03bc2 )| \u2264 2\u03b8\n|\u03a6\u03bb (\u03bc) \u2212 \u03a6\u03bb,app (\u03bc)| \u2264\n\n\u03b5\nk\u03a6\u03bb kL\u221e\n+\n.\n2\u03b8\n2\u03b8\u03b7 2 n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nThere exists \u03b2 a positive bounded real number, such that \u03bc1\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bc2\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2|\u03bc1 \u2212\n\u03bb\u03b8\n\ne \u22121\n\u03b5 \u22122\u03bb\u03b8\n\u03bc2 |, with for instance \u03b2 \u2265 1\u2212e\n.\n\u2212\u03b1\u03b8 . This in turn implies that \u03b7 \u2264 2\u03b8\u03b2 e\nTaking the maximal admissible value for \u03b7, we finally obtain that the approximation order n satisfies\n\nn\u2265\n\n4\u03b83 \u03b2 2 5\u03bb\u03b8\ne .\n\u03b53\n\nFrom this simple consideration coming from the use of Bernstein polynomials,\nwe obtain, to guarantee a norm upper bound \u03b5 for the error, a condition on\nthe order of the approximation. This condition is however quite conservative,\nand in practice, the order can be chosen iteratively, as illustrated in Fig. 3\nand Fig. 4.\n20\n\n\f2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n\noutput y\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ntime (s)\n\nFigure 3: Kernel approximations \u03b81,app (t) using exponentials in the time domain of the\nkernel \u03b81 (t) (continuous line), for orders n = 5 (dashed) and n = 10 (dot-dashed).\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\nerror \u03b5\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\napproximation degree n\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFigure 4: Representation of the norm error k\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b81,n kA with respect to the order n of\nthe approximation, for \u03b1 = 1 (star) and \u03b1 = 1/5 (circle).\n\n4.2. Properties in time and frequency domains\nLet fapp be a kernel approximation in B(f, \u03b5), for a given \u03b5 > 0 and\nf \u2208 K (I\u03b81 ,\u03b82 ).

Application to control of time-delay systems\nDistributed delays appear naturally in the control of time-delay systems.\nWe consider here as control application, the stabilization problem, and we\nillustrate the approximation method to realize the distributed time operator.\n5.1. Stabilization\nIn the stabilization problem, we determine a control law of a given plant,\nsuch that the closed-loop system is stable. For this, consider a distribution p\nwith a coprime factorization (n, d) over A , and define the closed-loop system\ndescribed in Fig. 6, with a compensator c defined over the quotient field of\nA.\nu2\n+\nu1\ne2\ny1 +\ny2\ne1\np\nc\n+\n\u2212\nFigure 6: Feedback System.\n\n23\n\n\fWe assume here that the plant p admits such a coprime factorization over A .\nThis is an assumption, but most dynamical systems fulfill it. The dynamical\nequations of this system are\n\u0014 c\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u2212pc \u0015\nu1\ny1\n1+pc\n, H(p, c) = 1+pc\n= H(p, c)\n.\n(32)\npc\np\nu2\ny2\n1+pc\n1+pc\nWe say that c stabilizes p, or the pair (p, c) is stable, if the matrix H(p, c) \u2208\nA 2\u00d72 . All internal signals in the closed-loop are bounded for any bounded\nexogeneous inputs u1 and u2 . A necessary and sufficient condition for (p, c)\nto be stable is the existence of some nc and dc in A such that\nn \u2217 nc + d \u2217 dc = \u03c5,\n\n(33)\n\nwith \u03c5 a unit in A . Since (n, d) is a coprime factorization, (33) holds, so\nwe conclude that a stabilizing compensator c has a coprime factorization\n(nc , dc ). A coprime factorization (nc , dc ) over A of a stabilizing compensator\nfor p, includes, in general, some distributed delays. Approximating such a\ncompensator as described in Section 3 yields to the approximated controller\ncapp with factorization (nc,app , dc,app ), where nc,app \u2208 B(nc , \u03b5n ) and dc,app \u2208\nB(dc , \u03b5d), for some given \u03b5n and \u03b5d . Applying this approximation in the\ncontrol, we would know the conditions on capp , such that the pair (p, capp )\nis stable. The positive answer comes from a direct application of small gain\ntheorem for BIBO-stability.\nLemma 6. The pair (p, capp ) is stable if\nmax(\u03b5n , \u03b5d ) <\n\n\u0001\nn d\n\n\u22121\nA\n\n.\n\nProof. Let (nc , dc ) be a coprime factorization over A of a stabilizing controller. From (33), we have\nn \u2217 nc + d \u2217 dc = \u03b4.\nThe approximated controller capp with factorization (nc,app , dc,app) yields in\nclosed-loop\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\nnc \u2212 nc,app\nn \u2217 nc,app + d \u2217 dc,app = \u03b4 \u2212 n d \u2217\n.\n(34)\ndc \u2212 dc,app\n24\n\n\fThe approximated controller will stabilize the plant p if and only if the right\nhand side in (34) is a unit over A . Since A is a Banach algebra, a sufficient\ncondition is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\nnc \u2212 nc,app\nn d \u2217\n< 1.\ndc \u2212 dc,app A\nVia approximations, nc,app \u2208 B(nc , \u03b5n ) and dc,app \u2208 B(dc , \u03b5d ), so that the\nabove inequality yields the sufficient condition\n\u0001\nn d A max(\u03b5n , \u03b5d ) < 1.\n\n\u2737\n\nAs a first comment, remark that it is always possible to determine an approximation capp such that (p, capp ) is stable. The counterpart will be in\nthe order of approximation, that will increase when the required accuracy\nvanishes. Small gain theorem, which is still valid over any Banach algebra,\ngives us a sufficient condition on the approximation accuracy to guarantee\nrobust stability. This condition helps us to determine the order of the approximation. Note that from [31] where the conservativeness of small gain\ntheorem for BIBO-stability was studied, a converse statement for Lemma 6\nholds, like in the H\u221e case. This highlights the weak conservation of such\na condition for robust stabilization. As an application, consider the plant\n\u0177(s) = p\u0302(s)\u00fb(s) given by\ne\u2212s\np\u0302(s) =\n.\n(35)\ns\u22121\n\u2212s\nA coprime factorization writes n\u0302 = e , d\u02c6 = s\u22121 , since\ns+1\n\ns+1\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u02c6\nn\u0302(s) 2 e1 + d(s)\n1 + 2 \u03b8\u03021 (s) = 1.\nHence, a stabilizing compensator for (35) is\nu(t) = \u22122(\u03b81 \u2217 u)(t) + 2 e1 y(t).\nFrom Lemma 6, a sufficient condition for robust stability with approximation\ne\nof \u03b81 is that \u03b5d \u2264 3+e\n. From Fig. 4, we see that a first order may be sufficient\nfor stability purpose. In practice, a sufficient accuracy is obtained for a\n5th order approximation over Ks (I0,1 ), as can be seen in Fig. 3, where step\nresponses are plotted. Note also that if we modify the coprime factorization\n(n, d), we could obtain lower order approximations.\n25\n\n\f1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\noutput y\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ntime (s)\n\nFigure 7: Step responses for the desired closed-loop (continuous line) and for the closedloop system with approximation of distributed delay (5th order, dash).\n\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we proposed a general framework for rational approximation of distributed delay operators. The properties of this approximation\nwere studied in both time and frequency domains. The effectiveness of this\nmethod was shown in simulation on the stabilization and the finite spectrum\nassignment problems, for general linear time-delay systems. We expect that\nthis work will bring some new light in the understanding of distributed delay\napproximation, and more generally in approximation for the control of linear\ninfinite dimensional systems. Such an approximation will provide foundations for a renewal of interest in control synthesis with distributed delays.\nDistributed delays inherit from integral control good robustness properties,\nand are at the core of numerous results in robustness analysis, optimization\nand control for time-delay systems.\nReferences\n[1] A.
