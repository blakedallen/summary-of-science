Prominent examples include the anomalous quantization of magneto-electric coupling [3\u20136], half-fermion states that are\ntheir own anti-particle [7, 8], and charge fractionalization in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate [9], all of which are not possible with conventional Dirac fermions\nof the graphene variety [10]. Helical Dirac fermions are challenging to find,\nand so far remain undiscovered, because they are forbidden to exist in ordinary\nDirac materials such as graphene [10] or bismuth [11], and because the necessary spin-sensitive measurements are lacking. It has recently been proposed\nthat helical Dirac fermions may exist at the edges of certain types of topologically ordered insulators [3, 4, 12], and that their peculiar properties may\nbe accessed provided the insulator is tuned into a topological transport regime\n[3\u20139]. However, helical Dirac fermions have not been observed in existing topological insulators [13\u201318] to date because conventional electrical gating based\ntuning techniques that work for graphene [10, 19] cannot be applied and the\nnecessary spin-resolved photoelectron detections do not exist. Here we report\nthe first realization of a tunable topological insulator in a bismuth based class by\ncombining spin- and momentum-resolved spectroscopies, bulk charge compensation and surface control. Our results reveal a spin-momentum locked Dirac\ncone that is nearly 100% spin-polarized, which exhibits a tunable topological\nfermion density in the vicinity of the Kramers' point and can be driven to the\nlong-sought topological transport regime. The observed topological nodal Dirac\nground state is found to be protected even up to room temperature (300 K). Our\nresults on Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 .NO2 pave the way for future transport based studies of\ntopological insulators, and possible room temperature applications of protected\nspin-polarized edge channels in microelectronics technology.\nUnlike conventional Dirac fermions as in graphene, helical Dirac fermions possess a net\nspin and are guaranteed to be conducting because of time-reversal symmetry [3\u20135], allowing\nthe unique possibility to carry spin currents without heat dissipation. However, the most\nimportant difference lies in the topological properties of helical Dirac fermion systems [3\u2013\n2\n\n\fSpin-helical Dirac cones\nMomentum distribution of spin\n\n0.2\n\nBi 2Te 3\n\nSpin polarization\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n-1\n\n-0.1\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.1\n0.0\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\nE B (eV)\n\n-0.1\n-0.2\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n-0.3\n\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-1\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\nPy\n\n0.2\n\n0.20.2\n\n(f)\n\nEB = -20 meV\n\n0.00.0\n\nM\n\n0.0\n\nG\n\n-0.1\n\nM\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\nPx\nPz\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\nM\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n\n-0.1\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n0.3\n\n-1\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n400\n\nMomentum distribution of spin\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-0.4\n\nEB = -20 meV\n\n-0.3\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n(e)\n\n(h)\n\n(g)\n\nky\n\nIy\nIy\n\n4350\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n-1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\n86\n\n90\n\nkx\n\n300\n3\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\nx10\n\nk y (\u00c5 )\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\nHigh\n\nTuned Bi2-dCa dSe 3\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nLow\n\nM\n\n3250\n200\n\nK\n\n5\n\n150\n2\n\n-0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2\n-1\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.3\n\n-1\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\nFIG. 1: Hsieh, Xia, Qian et al., NATURE 460, 1101 (2009).\n\n5, 12], which are predicted to manifest in several ways, provided the system can be tuned to\nthe topological transport regime where the charge density vanishes (analogous to the charge\nneutrality point in graphene [19]). These manifestations include an anomalous half-integer\nquantization of Hall conductance [3\u20136], a realization of Majorana fermions (particles with\nanyon exchange statistics that differs from the conventional Bose or Fermi-Dirac statistics)\n[7, 8], and a generation of fractionally charged particles [9]. Helical fermions are believed to\nexist on the edges of certain types of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators [3, 4, 12],\nwith material candidates Bi2 X3 (X = Se, Te) recently proposed based on observations [15, 17]\nand models [4, 20]. However, these materials cannot be used to detect helical Dirac fermion\nphysics for three reasons: First, the helical properties of the surface electrons are unknown\nand depend on the materials class. Second, their electronic structure is not in the topological\ntransport regime, thus not allowing any of the interesting topological insulator experiments\nto be performed to this date. And third, unlike 2D quantum Hall Dirac systems such as\ngraphene [10, 19], 3D topological insulators cannot be tuned to this zero carrier density\nregime through electrical gating, which has prevented a revolution like that witnessed for\ngraphene [10] from taking place for topological insulators.\nTo determine the key helical properties of the surface electrons near the Fermi level\n(EF ) in the candidate Bi2 X3 class, we performed spin- and angle-resolved photoemission\n3\n\n\fspectroscopy (ARPES) scans using a double Mott detector setup [21], which systematically\nmeasures all three components of the spin of a photoelectron as a function of its energy\nand momentum throughout the Brillouin zone (Supplementary Information). Although the\nsurface electrons of both Bi2 Se3 and Bi2 Te3 exhibit a finite density of states near EF (Figs\n1(a)-(d)), there is an additional contribution to the density of states around momentum \u0393\u0304\nfrom the spin-degenerate bulk conduction band in Bi2 Se3 [15]. Therefore, the helical nature\nof the surface electrons is most clearly resolved in Bi2 Te3 . We analyzed the spin-polarization\nof photoelectrons emitted at a binding energy EB = -20 meV along the kx (k \u0393\u0304-M\u0304) cut in\nBi2 Te3 (inset Fig. 1(e)). Because the surface state dispersion of Bi2 X3 exhibits a pronounced\ntime dependence after cleavage (SI) related to semiconductor band bending effects [17], data\ncollection times were only long enough to ensure a level of statistics sufficient to measure\nthe spin-polarized character of the surface states.\nFigures 1(e) and (f) show the measured spin polarization spectra Pi of the i = x, y and\nz (out-of-plane) components along the \u0393\u0304-M\u0304 direction. In the x and z directions, no clear\nsignal can be discerned within the margins of statistical error. In the y direction on the\nother hand, clear polarization signals of equal magnitude and opposite sign are observed for\nsurface electrons of opposite momentum, evidence that the spin and momentum directions\nare one-to-one locked. This is most clearly seen in the spin-resolved spectra (Iy\u2191,\u2193 ; Fig. 1(g)),\nwhich are calculated from Py according to Iy = Itot (1+Py )/2 and Iy = Itot (1-Py )/2, where\nItot is the spin-averaged intensity. To extract the spin polarization vectors of the forward\n(+kx ) and backward (-kx ) moving electrons, we performed a standard numerical fit (SI) [21].\nThe fit results yield 100(\u00b115)% polarized (see Fig. 1(h)) spins that point along the (k\u00d7z)\ndirection, which is consistent with its spin-orbit coupling origin [14, 21]. Our combined\nobservations of a linear dispersion relation and a one-to-one locking of momentum and spin\ndirections allow us to conclude that the surface electrons of Bi2 X3 (X = Se, Te) are helical\nDirac fermions of Z2 topological order origin (Fig. 1).\nTo experimentally access these helical Dirac fermions for research device applications,\nthe electronic structure must be in the topological transport regime where there is zero\ncharge fermion density [7\u20139]. This regime occurs when EF lies in between the bulk valence\nband maximum (VBM) and the bulk conduction band minimum (CBM), and exactly at\nthe surface Dirac point, which should in turn lie at a Kramers' time-reversal invariant\nmomentum [3, 4].

Although pure Bi2 X3 are expected to be undoped semiconductors [20, 22, 23],\nnominally stoichiometric samples are well known to be n- and p-type semiconductors due\nto excess carriers introduced via Se or Te site defects respectively [16, 17]. To compensate\nfor the unwanted defect dopants, trace amounts of carriers of the opposite sign must be\nadded into the naturally occurring material, which may be easier to achieve in Bi2 Se3 than\nin Bi2 Te3 because it has a larger band gap [24] (around 0.35 eV [25] compared to 0.18 eV\n[26] respectively). To lower the EF of Bi2 Se3 into the bulk band gap, we substituted trace\namounts of Ca2+ for Bi3+ in as-grown Bi2 Se3 , where Ca has been shown to act as a hole\ndonor by scanning tunnelling microscopy and thermoelectric transport studies [16]. Figure\n2(a) shows that as the Ca concentration increases from 0% to 0.5%, the low temperature\nresistivity sharply peaks at 0.25%, which suggests that the system undergoes a metal to\ninsulator to metal transition. The resistivity peak occurs at a Ca concentration where a\nchange in sign of the Hall carrier density also is observed (Fig. 2(b)), which shows that for\nmeasured Ca concentrations below and above 0.25%, electrical conduction is supported by\nelectron and hole carriers respectively.\nWe performed systematic time-dependent ARPES measurements to study the electronic\n5\n\n\fTuning the topological helical Dirac electron density\n\nk y (\u00c5 -1 )\n\n0.2\n\n0L\n\n0.1L\n\n2L\n\nHigh\n\n0.0\nLow\n\nEB (eV)\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n(d)\n0\n\n0.0\n\n(b)\n0.0\n0.2 -0.2\n(f)\n.01L\n\n(a)\n0.2 -0.2\n0 L (e)\n\n(c)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1L\n\n-0.2\n\nEB (eV)\n\n-0.4\n0\n\n(g)\n\n0.5L\n\n(h)\n\n1L\n\n(i)\n\n2L\n\n-0.2\nKramers'\npoint\n\n-0.4\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\n\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\nk x (\u00c5 -1 )\n\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\n\nFIG. 3: Hsieh, Xia, Qian et al., NATURE 460, 1101 (2009).\n\nstructure evolution of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 as a function of Ca doping in order to gain insight into\nthe trends observed in transport (Figs 2(a) and (b)). Early time ARPES energy dispersion\nmaps taken through the \u0393\u0304 point of the (111) surface Brillouin zone are displayed in Figure\n2(c)-(h) for several Ca doping levels. In the as-grown (\u03b4 = 0) Bi2 Se3 samples, a single\nsurface Dirac cone is observed with EF lying nearly 0.3 eV above the Dirac node forming\nan electron Fermi surface (FS). We also observe that EF intersects the electron-like bulk\nconduction band. When a 0.25% concentration of Ca is introduced, EF is dramatically\nlowered to lie near the Dirac node (Fig. 2(d)), which is consistent with Ca acting as a highly\neffective hole donor. Because the bulk CBM lies at a binding energy of approximately -0.1\neV for \u03b4 = 0 (Fig. 2(c)), an 0.3 eV shift in EF between \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b4 = 0.0025 suggests that\nfor \u03b4 = 0.0025, EF is located 0.2 eV below the CBM. This is consistent with EF being in the\nbulk band gap because the indirect energy gap between the CBM and the VBM is known\nfrom both tunneling [24] and optical [25] data and theory [22] to be nearly 0.35 eV.\nAs the Ca concentration is increased further, the position of EF continues a downward\n6\n\n\ftrend such that by \u03b4 = 0.01, it is located clearly below the Dirac node (Fig. 2(e)) and\nintersects the hole-like bulk valence band. The systematic lowering of EF with increasing \u03b4\nin Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 observed in early time ARPES measurements (Figs 2(i)-(k)), which reflect\nthe electronic structure of the sample bulk, consistently explain the measured transport\nbehavior. However, we observe that EF rises back up over time across all samples such that\nall spectra relax back to a \u03b4 = 0 like spectrum on a typical time scale of 18 hours (Fig.\n2(l)). Such a slow upward shift of the surface Fermi level has been observed also in Bi2 Te3\n[17] and is due to a surface band bending effect commonly observed in most semiconductors\n(SI). Therefore, although bulk Ca doping succeeds in tuning EF between the bulk valence\nand conduction bands, it does not change the position of EF relative to the surface Dirac\npoint in the ground state.\nBecause the surface Dirac point in the ground state of most insulating Bi1.9975 Ca0.0025 Se3\nlies \u223c0.3 eV below EF , its electronic structure is still not in the much desired topological\ntransport regime. To bring the surface Dirac point level with EF in Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 , we show\nthat hole carriers can be systematically introduced into the surface by dosing with NO2\nmolecules, which has been demonstrated in graphene [27, 28]. Figure 3 shows that with\nincreasing surface hole donor concentration, the binding energy of the surface Dirac point\nrises monotonically towards EF . Starting from EB \u223c -0.3 eV at a 0 Langmuir (L) dose,\nit rises to -0.15 eV at 0.1 L where the surface bent CBM has completely disappeared, and\nfinally to the charge neutrality point (EB = 0 eV) at 2 L. No further changes of the chemical\npotential are observed with higher dosages. To quantify the surface carrier density (n)\ndependence on surface hole donor concentration, we mapped the surface state FS in Figures\n3(a)-(c) and performed an electron count based on FS area n = AF S /ABZ , where AF S is\nthe area of the FS and ABZ is the area of the surface Brillouin zone. We find that 0.1 L\nof NO2 removes approximately 0.0066 electrons per surface unit cell of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 (111),\nand an excess of 2 L reduces the FS to a single point within our experimental resolution,\nwhich has an additional 0.005 electrons per unit cell removed. Because surface doping does\nnot affect the carrier density in the bulk (which thus remains insulating), the energy of the\nDirac point is lifted above the bulk VBM; a new time independent electronic ground state\nis realized that lies in the topological transport regime with EF intersecting the Dirac node.\nIn order to investigate the thermal stability of this nodal Dirac ground state (Fig. 4(e)),\ntemperature dependent ARPES scans were collected on Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 samples that were first\n7\n\n\fsurface hole doped with NO2 at a temperature T = 10 K. Figures 4(c) and (d) illustrate that\nthe charge neutral point-like FS (Fig. 4(a)) is robust up to room temperature (T = 300 K)\nover days long measurement times. A density of states that decreases linearly to zero at the\nDirac point energy at 300 K (Fig. 4(f)) is further evidence that the low energy properties of\nBi1.9975 Ca0.0025 Se3 .NO2 are dominated by a novel ground state that features massless helical\nDirac fermions with nearly 100% spin polarization. This also confirms a non-trivial \u03c0 Berrys\nphase on the surface due to the spin-momentum locking pattern that we observe, which is\nsimilar to the robust Berrys phase previously observed in the Bi-Sb system [14] (Fig. 1).\nHelical nodal Dirac fermions are forbidden from acquiring a mass through band gap\nformation because they are located around time-reversal invariant (Kramers') momenta\nkT = \u0393\u0304 or M\u0304 (Fig. 4(h)). This makes them fundamentally different from chiral Dirac\nfermions such as those found in graphene, which are located at K\u0304 and not topologically\nprotected (Fig. 4(g)). The helical Dirac fermion on the surface of Bi2 Se3 owes its existence\nto a non-zero topological number \u03bd0 given by (-1)\u03bd0 = \u03a0kT \u03a0N\nm=1 \u03be2m (kT ), where \u03be2m (kT )\nis the parity eigenvalue of the bulk wavefunction at the 3D Kramers' point kT and N is\nthe number of occupied bulk bands [4]. Because Ca dopants are present in only trace\nquantities in Bi1.9975 Ca0.0025 Se3 .NO2 , the values of \u03be2m (kT ) do not deviate from those of\npure Bi2 Se3 , as evidenced by the persistence of a single gapless surface band in both Bi2 Se3\nand Bi1.9975 Ca0.0025 Se3 . Both Ca2+ and NO2\u2212 are non-magnetic and so do not break timereversal symmetry, therefore the same topological number (\u03bd0 = 1) applies even in the\nDirac transport regime (Fig. 4) realized by our method shown here, which is stable with\nboth time and temperature. Our direct demonstration of spin-polarized edge channels and\nroom temperature operability of chemically gated stoichiometric Bi2 Se3 or Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 , not\nachieved in purely 2D topological systems such as Hg(Cd)Te quantum wells [29], enables\nexciting future room temperature experiments on surface helical Dirac fermions that carry\na non-trivial \u03c0 Berry's phase.\nOur demonstration of topological order at room temperature opens up possibilities of using quantum Hall-like phenomena and spin-polarized protected edge channels for spintronic\nor computing device applications without the traditional requirements of high magnetic\nfields and delicate cryogenics. A direct detection of surface-edge states would be possible in\nstoichiometric Bi2 Se3 or Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 , using transport methods which will bear signatures of\nweak anti-localization and thus exhibit anomalous magneto-optic effects.

By applying a weak time-reversal breaking perturbation at the surface\nof Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 .NO2 so as to lift the Kramers' degeneracy at EF (A method of gap opening\non the surface is shown in the SI), a half-integer quantized magneto-electric coupling can be\nrealized [3\u20136], which may be measured by standard Hall probes. This would enable a variety\nof novel surface quantum Hall physics to be realized. Another class of experiments would\nbe made possible by interfacing the helical topological surface with magnetic and ordinary\nsuperconducting films. An interferometer device can be built based on Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 that\nis used to create and detect long-sought Majorana fermions [7, 8]. These particles, which\nhave never been experimentally observed, possess only half the degrees of freedom of a conventional fermion and constitute the key building block for topological quantum computing\nthat can operate in fault-tolerant mode. Yet another class of experiments would be made\npossible by sandwiching a charge neutral topological insulator film made of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3\nwithin a charged capacitor. In this way, a microchip that supports a topological electronhole condensate with fractionally charged vortices [9] can be fabricated, which offers the\nexciting opportunity to probe interactions between Dirac fermions of opposite helicity; this\nwould enable searching for exotic quantum phenomena beyond the standard model of particle physics [30].\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgements The spin-resolved ARPES measurements are supported by NSF through\nthe Center for Complex Materials (DMR-0819860) and Princeton University; the use of synchrotron\nX-ray facilities (ALS-LBNL Berkeley) is supported by the Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy (DE-FG-02-05ER46200) and by the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute,\nVilligen, Switzerland.\n\nAuthor information Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to M.Z.H\n(mzhasan@princeton.edu).\n\nMETHODS\nSpin-integrated ARPES data were taken at beamlines 12.0.1 and 7.0.1 of the Advanced Light\nSource in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with 29 eV to 100 eV photons. Typical energy\nand momentum resolutions were 15 meV and 1% of the surface BZ and 50 meV and 2% of the\nsurface BZ respectively. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements were performed at the SIS beamline\nat the Swiss Light Source using the COPHEE spectrometer, which consists of two 40 kV classical\nMott detectors that measure all three spatial components of spin polarization. Spin-resolved measurements were taken with 20 eV to 22 eV photons with energy and momentum resolutions of 80\nmeV and 3% of the surface BZ respectively. Spin-integrated data were collected on Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3\nand Bi2 Te3 single crystals cleaved in ultra high vacuum pressures better than 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 torr and\nmaintained at a temperature of 10 K unless otherwise specified.

The adsorption effects were studied under static flow mode by exposing the cleaved sample surface to the gas for a certain time then taking data after the chamber was\npumped down to the base pressure. Spectra of the NO2 adsorbed surfaces were taken within minutes of opening the photon shutter to minimize photon exposure related effects.

Bi1.9975 Ca0.0025 Se3\nis known to be most metallic-like among the three classes studied so far. (b) Hall carrier density\n\n13\n\n\fof the same samples determined using Hall measurements. Symbols colored red (blue) represent\nn- (p-) type behavior. (c) ARPES band dispersion images of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 (111) through collected\nwithin 20 minutes after cleavage for \u03b4 = 0, (d) \u03b4 = 0.0025 and (e) \u03b4 = 0.01. Panels (f) through (h)\nshow the corresponding momentum distributions curves. Red lines are guides to the eye. Panels\n(i) through (k) show the schematic downward evolution of EF with increasing Ca content. The\noccupied bulk conduction band (BCB) and bulk valence band (BVB) states are shaded dark, and\nthe occupied surface states (SS) are colored red. (l) Typical ARPES band dispersion image of\npanels (c) through (e) taken around 18 hours after cleavage and (m) its corresponding momentum\ndistribution curves. (n) Schematic of the surface band bending process that is responsible for the\nobserved downward shift in energies over time. Vac., vacuum.\n\nFigure 3: Tuning the density of helical Dirac electrons to the spin-degenerate\nKramers point and topological transport regime. (a) A high resolution ARPES mapping\nof the surface Fermi surface (FS) near \u0393\u0304 of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 (111). The diffuse intensity within the\nring originates from the bulk-surface resonance state [15]. (b) The FS after 0.1 Langmuir (L) of\nNO2 is dosed, showing that the resonance state is removed. (c) The FS after a 2 L dosage, which\nachieves the Dirac charge neutrality point. (d) High resolution ARPES surface band dispersions\nthrough after an NO2 dosage of 0 L, (e) 0.01 L, (f) 0.1 L, (g) 0.5 L, (h) 1 L and (i) 2 L. The arrows\ndenote the spin polarization of the bands. We note that due to an increasing level of surface\ndisorder with NO2 adsorption, the measured spectra become progressively more diffuse and the\ntotal photoemission intensity from the buried Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 surface is gradually reduced.\n\nFigure 4 : Topological order of the nodal helical Dirac ground state at 300 K. (a)\nTypical ARPES intensity map of the Bi2 (Se/Te)3 class collected at EF spanning several Brillouin\nzones. (b) Energy distribution curves of the valence bands of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 taken at T = 10 K,\n200 K and 300 K. The peaks around -4 eV and -7.5 eV come from NO2 adsorption (SI). The\nintensity of these NO2 core level peaks do not change over this temperature range, indicating no\nmeasurable NO2 desorption during the heating process. (c) ARPES intensity map of the surface\nstate band dispersion of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 (111) after a 2 L dosage of NO2 is applied at T = 10 K,\nwhich is taken at 300 K and (d) 10 K. (e) Schematic of the surface and bulk electronic structure of\n\n14\n\n\fBi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 .NO2 , tuned to the topological transport regime. (f) Angle-integrated intensity near\n(red) shows a linear trend. The inset shows the expected density of states (DOS) of a helical Dirac\ncone, which is 1/2 that of a graphene Dirac cone due to its single spin degeneracy. (g) Schematic\nof the chiral Dirac fermion ground state of graphene, which exhibits spin-degenerate Dirac cones\nthat intersect away from the Kramers' points. (h) Schematic of the helical Dirac fermion ground\nstate of Bi2\u2212\u03b4 Ca\u03b4 Se3 .NO2 , which exhibits a spin-polarized Dirac cone that intersects at a Kramers'\npoint and guarantees a \u03bd0 = 1 topological quantum number for the ground state.\n\n15\n\n\fSpin-helical Dirac cones\nMomentum distribution of spin\n\n0.2\n\nBi 2Te 3\n\nSpin polarization\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n-1\n\n0.0\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.1\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n(d)\n-0.3\n\n-0.1\n\nG\n\n-0.1\n\n-1\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\nM\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n(f)\n\nEB = -20 meV\n\n-0.1\n\nPx\nPz\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\nM\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\n(h)\n\n(g)\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n-1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\nky\n\nIy\nIy\n\n4350\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n0.3\n\n-1\n\n5\n\n86\n\nkx\n\n90\n\n300\n\nM\n\n3250\n200\n\n5\n\nK\n\n150\n2\n\n-0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2\n-1\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.20.2\n0.00.0\n\nM\n\n0.0\n\n400\n\nMomentum distribution of spin\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.3\n\n-1\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\nFIG. 5: Hsieh, Xia, Qian et al., NATURE 460, 1101 (2009).\n\nBi1.9975 Ca 0.0025 Se3\nEB (eV)\n\n0.0\n\nSb0.1\n0.9\nBi0.9 SbBi\n0.1\n\n15\n10\n\n0\n0.2\n\nBi2 Se3+x\n\n(c)\n\nCa 0%\n\n-0.1\n\np-type\nn-type\nn-type\n\n-0.3\nd=0\n\n(e)\n\n(l)\n\nCa 1%\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\n(f)\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\n(g)\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\n(h)\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\nEF\n\n(m)\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1\n\nEB\n\nBCB\n\nCBM\n\nEF\nSS\n\nBi2-xCa\nSe\nBi\n2-d Cadx Se33\n\n-0.2\n\n(d) Ca 0.25%\n\n-0.1 0.0\n\n0.1 p-type\n0.0\n\nTuning through bulk doping\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\nBi1.9933Sn0.0067Te3\n\n5 Bi1.9933 Sn 0.0067 Te 3\n0.3\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n20\n\n(b)\n3\n\nCompensated\ninsulator\n\n25\n\nnHall (10 e / cm )\n\nW cm)\nr4 K (mW\n\n(a)\n\n20\n\nE B (eV)\n\n-0.1\n\n(c)\n\nPy\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-0.4\n\nEB = -20 meV\n\n-0.3\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n\n(e)\n\n3\n\nk y (\u00c5 )\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\nHigh\n\nTuned Bi2-dCa dSe 3\n\nx10\n\nLow\n\nx=0\nx = 0.03\n\nVBM\n\n(i)\n\n0.0025 dx==0.005\n0.005\ndx==0.0025\n\nBVB\n-1\n\nk (\u00c5 )\n\n(j)\n\n(n)\n\n(k)\n-1\n\nk (\u00c5 )\n\n-1\n\nk (\u00c5 )\n\nCharge compensation\n\nFIG. 6: Hsieh, Xia, Qian et al., NATURE 460, 1101 (2009).\n\n16\n\nvac\n\ncrystal\nz=0\n\n\fTuning the topological helical Dirac electron density\n\nk y (\u00c5 -1 )\n\n0.2\n\n0L\n\n0.1L\n\n2L\n\nHigh\n\n0.0\nLow\n\nEB (eV)\n\n-0.2\n-0.2\n(d)\n0\n\n(b)\n0.0\n0.2 -0.2\n(f)\n.01L\n\n(a)\n0.2 -0.2\n0 L (e)\n\n0.0\n\n(c)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1L\n\n-0.2\n\nEB (eV)\n\n-0.4\n0\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\n0.5L\n\n(i)\n\n1L\n\n2L\n\n-0.2\nKramers'\npoint\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\n\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\nk x (\u00c5 -1 )\n\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\n\nFIG. 7: Hsieh, Xia, Qian et al., NATURE 460, 1101 (2009).\n\nTopological order at room temperature\n(b)\n\nG\n\n0\n\nM\n\nM\n\n-1\n\nK\n\n-1\n\nEB (eV)\n\n(c)\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\nT = 300K\n\n(d)\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nk x (\u00c5 )\n\n0.1\n\n(g)\n\nChiral Dirac ground state\n\nKramers'\npoint\n\nky\n\n200K\n\nBVB\n\n10K\n\nBi 2-xCax Se3 .
