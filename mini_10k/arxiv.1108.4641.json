For nearly three decades, ultracold atoms have been produced using laser Doppler\ncooling and evaporative cooling. At temperatures between 1 nK and 1 \u03bcK, atoms enter a fully quantal regime\nwith novel properties, forming Bose-Einstein condensates\n[2\u20134] and Fermi-degenerate gases [5, 6]. However, cooling\nmolecular samples to the temperatures required for quantum degeneracy is much more difficult than for atoms,\nbecause molecules have a much richer internal structure.\nMolecular cooling techniques can be classified as either direct or indirect. In direct methods, molecules are\ncooled from relatively high temperatures by techniques\nsuch as buffer-gas cooling [7], Stark deceleration [8] or\nZeeman deceleration [9\u201311]. In addition, laser Doppler\ncooling has very recently been demonstrated for SrF [12],\nalthough only a very limited number of molecular species\nare likely to be amenable to this technique. Indirect\nmethods, by contrast, form ultracold molecules in gases\nof previously cooled atoms by magnetoassociation [13, 14]\nor photoassociation [13, 15]. In the last few years, indirect methods in association with stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [16] have succeeded in producing ground-state molecules at temperatures below 1 \u03bcK\n[17\u201319]. Indirect methods are however restricted to the\nrelatively few atomic species that can be laser-cooled.\nDirect methods can in principle be used for a wide variety of molecules, but the lowest temperatures achieved\nso far are in the millikelvin regime. A second-stage cooling technique is needed to cool molecules down to the\nmicrokelvin range, from which evaporative cooling could\n\nreach the region of quantum degeneracy. Sympathetic\ncooling is a promising second-stage cooling method,\nwhich relies on thermalization of the molecular species\nof interest by collisions with ultracold atoms. Sympathetic cooling has been used for almost three decades\nto cool molecular ions to temperatures around 100 mK\nand below [20, ch. 18], and has more recently also been\nused for neutral atoms [21, 22]. Its extension to neutral\nmolecules was first proposed in 2004 by Sold\u00e1n and Hutson [23]. Since then, accurate quantum scattering calculations have suggested that it should work for a few diatomic [24, 25] and polyatomic molecular species [26, 27]\nin combination with appropriate ultracold atoms. Although experimental validation is still needed, there is\ngreat hope that sympathetic cooling will eventually become a 'routine' second-stage cooling technique, capable\nof producing large molecular samples in the microkelvin\nregime, where most of the new interesting applications\nwould become possible [1].\nCold atoms and molecules are usually held in traps\nformed with electric, magnetic or optical fields. By far\nthe most experimentally accessible traps are those formed\nby static electric [28] and magnetic fields [7]. The main\nlimitation of such traps is that they can hold only those\nmolecules whose energy increases with applied field, i.e.\nthose in low-field-seeking states. However, there are always untrapped high-field-seeking states that lie energetically below the low-field-seeking states. Inelastic (deexcitation) collisions that transfer molecules to high-field\nseeking states therefore lead to trap loss. Elastic collisions, by contrast, are required for thermalization. Thus,\nthe success of both sympathetic and evaporative cooling\ndepends on a favorable ratio of elastic to inelastic cross\nsections, of at least about 100 [29].\nIn the (ultra)cold regime, hyperfine interactions are\nlarger than or comparable to the kinetic energies in-\n\n\f2\nvolved. Hyperfine couplings also provide both additional\nrelaxation mechanisms and new ways to control atomic\nand molecular collisions. However, only a few calculations have so far considered the consequences of hyperfine interactions on cold molecular collisions. Bohn and\ncoworkers considered the scattering of polar 16 OH(2 \u03a03/2 )\nmolecules in static electric [30] and magnetic fields [31].\nLara et al. [32, 33] studied the field-free scattering of\nRb(2 S) and OH(2 \u03a03/2 ). Tscherbul et al. studied (ultra)cold collisions of YbF(2 \u03a3) molecules with He in external electric and magnetic fields [34]. They found\nthat simultaneous electron and nuclear spin relaxation\nfor collisions in the ground rotational state can occur\nthrough couplings via excited rotational states and hyperfine terms.\nIn the present paper, we explore the effects of hyperfine interactions on the ultracold scattering of NH with\nMg in the presence of a magnetic field. This extends the\nstudy in [34] in various ways: (1) NH is a 3 \u03a3 instead of a\n2\n\u03a3 molecule; (2) NH has two nuclei with non-zero spin,\nleading to more complicated hyperfine structure than for\nYbF; (3) we consider hyperfine states other than spinstretched states. Our results are compared with those of\na previous study of Mg-NH neglecting hyperfine terms\n[24], and allow us to make some general conclusions on\nhow hyperfine interactions can affect the prospects of\nsympathetic cooling.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nWe consider the scattering of 14 NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) molecules\nwith 24 Mg(1 S) atoms in the presence of an external\nmagnetic field B, whose direction defines the spacefixed Z-axis. The system is described using Jacobi vectors/coordinates: the vector r runs from N to H while\nR runs from the center of mass of NH to Mg. The angle\nbetween r and R is \u03b8. The collision is studied by solving\nthe time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the scattering wave function \u03a8 at energy E, \u0124\u03a8 = E\u03a8, where\n\u0124 is the Hamiltonian for the colliding pair.\nA.\n\nEffective Hamiltonian\n\nBy convention, lower-case symbols are used for quantum numbers of the individual monomers, and capital\nletters are used for quantum numbers of the collision\ncomplex as a whole. Where necessary, the subscripts\n1 and 2 refer to Mg and NH respectively. The diatom is\nconsidered to be a rigid rotor in its ground vibrational\nstate. The effective Hamiltonian can be written\nh\u03042\nd2\nh\u03042 L\u03022\n+ \u0124mon + \u012412 ,\n\u0124 = \u2212 R\u22121 2 R +\n2\u03bc\ndR\n2\u03bcR2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L\u0302 is the space-fixed operator for the end-over-end\nrotation and \u03bc is the reduced mass of the complex. In\n\ngeneral, \u0124mon contains terms describing both isolated\nmonomers, \u0124mon = \u01241 + \u01242 . However, ground-state\n24\nMg has both zero electron spin and zero nuclear spin,\nso that it contributes only a constant energy and it is\nconvenient to set \u01241 = 0. Finally, \u012412 includes all interactions between the monomers, which in the present\ncase reduces to the potential energy surface V\u0302 (ur , R),\nconveniently expanded in Legendre polynomials\nV\u0302 (ur , R) =\n\nkX\nmax\n\nVk (req , R)Pk (cos \u03b8).\n\n(2)\n\nk=0\n\nHere ur denotes a unit vector in the direction of r, req is\nthe equilibrium distance of NH in its ground vibrational\nstate and Vk are the radial strength functions. The potential for the Mg-NH system was reported in Ref. [35].\nThe Hamiltonian for an isolated NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) molecule\ncan be written \u01242 = \u0124rot +\u0124sn +\u0124ss +\u0124hf +\u0124Z . The different terms will be discussed below and correspond, respectively, to the rotational, electron spin-rotation, electron spin-spin, hyperfine and Zeeman interactions.\nIf centrifugal distortion and all other higher-order corrections are neglected, the Hamiltonian for the mechanical rotation of NH is \u0124rot = bNH n\u03022 , where bNH is the\nrotational constant (with dimensions of energy) and n\u0302 is\nthe operator for the rotational angular momentum. The\nelectron spin-rotation term, arising from the interaction\nbetween the magnetic moment associated with the composite electronic spin of NH, \u015d, and the magnetic field\ninduced by its rotation, can be written \u0124sn = \u03b3 n\u0302 * \u015d,\nwhere \u03b3 is the spin-rotation constant.\nThe direct dipolar interaction between the unpaired\nelectrons in NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) may be written [36]\n\u0124ss \u2248 2\u03bbss T2q=0 (\u015d, \u015d)T2q=0 (ur , ur ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bbss is the electron spin-spin constant and Tk represents a spherical tensor of rank k, with q-component\nTkq .\nSince both the 14 N and 1 H nuclei have non-zero nuclear\nspin, iN = 1 and iH = 1/2, the hyperfine Hamiltonian can\nbe written\n\u0124hf = \u0124si,N + \u0124F,N + \u0124in,N + \u0124Q,N + \u0124si,H + \u0124F,H + \u0124in,H .\n(4)\nHere, \u0124si represents the direct dipolar interaction between the magnetic moments associated with a given nuclear spin \u0131\u0302 and the composite electron spin of the openshell \u03a3 molecule and can be written [36]\n\u221a\n\u0124si = \u2212 10gS \u03bcB gi \u03bcN (\u03bc0 /4\u03c0)T1 (\u015d, C 2 ) * T1 (\u0131\u0302)\n\u221a\n\u2248 6t0 T2q=0 (\u015d, \u0131\u0302),\n(5)\nwhere gS and gi are the electron and nuclear g-factors,\n\u03bcB and \u03bcN are the Bohr and nuclear magnetons, and\n\u03bc0 is the magnetic permeability of free space. The axial\ndipolar interaction parameter t0 is related to the widelyused constant c defined by Frosch and Foley [37] as t0 =\nc/3.\n\n\f3\nThe Fermi (or Fermi-Breit) contact interaction \u0124F occurs whenever there is a non-zero electron-spin density\nat a nucleus with non-zero spin \u0131\u0302. It may be written\n\u0124F = bF \u015d * \u0131\u0302, where bF is a coupling constant given\nby bF = (2/3)gS \u03bcB gi \u03bcN |\u03c8(0)|2 , with |\u03c8(0)|2 the spin\ndensity. The coupling constant can also be written\nin terms of Frosch and Foley's b and c parameters as\nbF = b + (1/3)c.\nSince iN > 1/2, the interaction between the nuclear\nelectric quadrupole moment Q and the electric field gradient at the 14 N nucleus \u2207E must be included. In general, this is [36]\n\u0124Q = \u2212eT2 (\u2207E) * T2 (Q),\n\nThe nuclear shielding factors \u03c3X are extremely small and\nare neglected in the present work.\nThe molecular constants used for the 14 NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) radical are listed in Table I.\nCoupled-channel equations\n\nWe solve the scattering problem using the coupledchannel method.

This gives the scattering matrix S, from which\nall quantities of interest, such as state-to-state cross sections and scattering lengths, may be calculated. Numerical details are given in Sec. III B.\n\nC.\n\nBasis set and matrix elements\n\nWe use a fully uncoupled basis set |ai \u2261 |\u03b1i |LML i,\nwhere |\u03b1i \u2261 |iN miN i |iH miH i |sms i |nmn i describes the\nstate of the monomers, and mA (or MA ) denotes the\nprojection on the field axis of the vector operator \u00c2.\nNone of the interactions considered here change the electronic or nuclear spins, so we omit the labels s and i and\nlabel our basis functions (miN , miH , ms , n, mn , L, ML ).\nA static magnetic field conserves both the projection\nMtot of the total angular momentum F and the total\nparity P of the system. These are explicitly Mtot =\nmiN + miH + ms + mn + ML and P = p1 p2 (\u22121)L , with\np1 = 1 the parity of Mg(1 S) and p2 = (\u22121)n+1 the parity\nof NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ). The matrix elements for the centrifugal, rotational, electron spin-spin and interaction potential are\ndiagonal in, and independent of, the nuclear spin quantum numbers. The corresponding expressions in our basis\nset are thus readily obtained from Ref. [41].\n\n\f4\nThe Zeeman matrix elements are completely diagonal in the uncoupled basis set,\nhsms | hiH miH | hiN miN | \u0124Z |iN miN i |iH miH i |sms i = B [gS \u03bcB ms \u2212 \u03bcN (gN miN + gH miH )] .\n\n(12)\n\nHere and throughout this section, the matrix elements are fully diagonal with respect to quantum numbers that do\nnot appear explicitly in the expression.\nThe Fermi contact term and the electron and nuclear spin-rotation terms all share a similar structure, \u0124j1 j2 = \u03ba\uf6be\u03021 *\uf6be\u03022 ,\nwhere \u03ba is a scalar while \uf6be\u03021 and \uf6be\u03022 are vector operators. In general, their matrix elements in a decoupled basis set,\n|j1 mj1 i |j2 mj2 i, are\nj2 m0j2 = \u03b4mj1 m0j1 \u03b4mj2 m0j2 \u03ba mj1 mj2\n\u00031/2 \u0002\n\u00031/2\n\u03ba\u0002\n+\u03b4mj1 m0j1 \u00b11 \u03b4mj2 m0j2 \u22131 j1 (j1 + 1) \u2212 mj1 m0j1\n.\nj2 (j2 + 1) \u2212 mj2 m0j2\n2\n\nhj2 mj2 | hj1 mj1 | \u0124j1 j2 j1 m0j1\n\n(13)\n\nSuch terms can mix functions with adjacent values of the projections of \uf6be\u03021 and \uf6be\u03022 , but preserve the sum m12 =\nmj1 + mj2 .\nThe electron-nuclear spin dipolar interaction, Eq.

This term produces couplings off-diagonal in one nuclear spin projection\nmi , along with ms and mn (keeping their sum unchanged), with \u2206n \u2261 n0 \u2212 n = 0 or \u00b12. This latter selection rule is\nrequired to conserve p2 .\nFinally, the quadrupole interaction for the 14 N nucleus has matrix elements\nhnmn | hiN miN | \u0124Q,N |iN m0iN i |n0 m0n i\n\n(eq0 Q)N\nn 2 n0\n1/2\n(\u22121)iN \u2212miN \u2212mn [(2n + 1)(2n0 + 1)]\n=\n4\n0 0 0\n!\n!\nX\nn 2 n0\niN\n2 iN\n\u00d7\n(\u22121)p\n.\n0\n\u2212mn p mn\n\u2212miN \u2212p m0iN\np\n\n!\n\niN 2 iN\n\u2212iN 0 iN\n\n!\u22121\n\n(15)\n\nThese couple functions \u2206n = 0, \u00b12 and \u2206miN = \u2212\u2206mn = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, thus preserving the sum miN + mn as well as\np2 .\nThe first 3-j symbol in Eqs. (14) and (15) implies that\nthe electron-nuclear spin and quadrupolar interactions\nhave no direct off-diagonal matrix elements between n =\n0 functions, so that their dominant contribution for n =\n0 is a second-order effect necessarily involving the n =\n2 excited rotational state; this is also the case for the\nelectron spin-spin interaction.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA.\n\nHyperfine levels\n\nThe energy levels correlating with the ground rotational state of an isolated 14 NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) molecule, in an\nexternal magnetic field, are shown in Fig. 1. The solid\nlines correspond to the inclusion of all hyperfine interactions as described in Sec. II A, while the dashed lines\n\nshow the energy levels obtained when hyperfine terms are\nneglected.\nThe hyperfine-free levels are labeled at zero field by\nthe eigenvalues of the angular momentum \uf6be\u0302 = n\u0302 + \u015d,\nwhich has only one allowed value, j = 1, for n = 0 and\ns = 1. In the presence of a magnetic field, a level with\nquantum number j splits into 2j + 1 Zeeman components\ncharacterized by the projection mj onto the field axis,\nand the corresponding eigenstates can be represented as\n|(ns)jmj i. For n = 0, mj = ms and these states can\nalternatively be labeled by ms .\nThe pattern is much more complicated when hyperfine interactions are included. In this case, the zero-field\nlevels are labeled by the eigenvalues of the total angular\nmomentum f\u02c6 resulting from coupling the nuclear spins\n\u0131\u0302N and \u0131\u0302H with n\u0302 and \u015d. In general, three or more angular momenta can be coupled using a variety of schemes.\nWe start, as before, by first coupling n\u0302 and \u015d to form\n\uf6be\u0302. Then, given the molecular constants in Table I, it is\n\n\f5\nmf\n\n0.0\n\n3/2 1/2 -1/2\n\n5/2 3/2 1/2\n\n-0.2\n\nms = +1\n\nfH f\nEnergy \u00d7 100/cm-1\n\n-0.4\n3/2\n\n-0.6\n\n-3/2\n\n1/2\n\n-1/2\n\n1/2\n\n0\n\n1/2\n\n-0.8\n\n-1/2\n\n5/2\n3/2 3/2 3/2\n\n-1.0\n\n3/2\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n-1.2\n-1.4\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n25\n\n-1/2 -3/2 -5/2\n\n50\nMagnetic field, B/G\n\n1/2 -1/2 -3/2\n\n75\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Magnetic field dependence of the energy levels of 14 NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) correlating with the ground rotational state, including (black, solid) and excluding (blue,\ndashed) hyperfine terms.\n\nconvenient to couple \uf6be\u0302 first with \u0131\u0302H to produce a resultant f\u02c6H . Finally, f\u02c6H is coupled with \u0131\u0302N to give f\u02c6. In\nthe particular case of n = 0, j = s = 1 and fH = 1/2,\n3/2, which produces levels with f = 1/2 and 3/2 for\nfH = 1/2 and f = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2 for fH = 3/2, as\nshown in Fig. 1. For n = 0, the Fermi contact terms\nmake by far the largest contributions to the splittings,\nand levels with fH = 3/2 lies below those with fH = 1/2\nbecause bF,H < 0. In a magnetic field, each f state further splits into 2f + 1 sublevels, producing a total of\n(2iN + 1)(2iH + 1)(2s + 1) = 18 components correlating\nwith the ground rotational state. At low fields, below\nabout 10 G, the eigenfunctions are approximately represented as |(ns)j, (jiH )fH , (fH iN )f mf i. In what follows,\neven though fH and f are not good quantum numbers in\na field, we use quantum numbers (fH , f, mf ) in parentheses to identify the states at low field. In addition, levels\nwill be labeled \u03b2i (i = 1, 18) in order of increasing energy\nat fields above 50 G, where ms is a nearly good quantum number. With this convention, \u03b21 \u2013\u03b26 correspond to\nms = \u22121, \u03b27 \u2013\u03b212 to ms = 0, and \u03b213 \u2013\u03b218 to ms = +1.\nFor isolated NH, the total projection mf is a good\nquantum number. Hence, as a function of field, states\ncorresponding to different mf can cross while states of\nthe same mf cannot. However, in our model Hamiltonian, states \u03b210 and \u03b213 (both with mf = 1/2) are seen to\ncross at about 25 G. This is a nonphysical effect which results from neglecting the interaction between the nuclear\nspins of N and H, usually written in the form c4 \u0131\u0302N * \u0131\u0302H .\nFor NH, c4 is extremely small and has not been measured\nexperimentally; there is in reality an avoided crossing between states \u03b210 and \u03b213 , but it is extremely tight.\nAt high field, the terms in the monomer Hamiltonian\nthat mix states with different values of ms are small with\nrespect to the electron Zeeman splitting and ms is well\ndefined. For n = 0 at fields over 75 G, three groups of\nNH levels corresponding to ms = \u22121, 0 and +1 can be\n\nidentified, containing six hyperfine levels each. In this\nregime, the individual nuclear spin projections miN and\nmiH are also nearly conserved and the eigenfunctions are\nwell represented by individual basis functions |\u03b1i. Above\n75 G, more than 93.5% of any eigenstate is represented\nby a single basis function |\u03b1i. In the high-field limit we\nlabel states with quantum numbers in square brackets,\n[ms , miN , miH ].\nAll ms = +1 states are low-field-seeking and therefore trappable in a static magnetic trap. When hyperfine\ninteractions are included, there are six such levels with\ndifferent values of mf . In contrast, when hyperfine terms\nare neglected, there is only one such state.\nOne state of particular interest is the spin-stretched\nstate, in which f and mf take their highest possible\nvalues. Except for terms off-diagonal in n, this state\nis exactly represented by a single basis function in either possible basis set, (fH , f, mf ) = (3/2, 5/2, +5/2) or\n[ms , miN , miH ] = [+1, +1, +1/2]. For 14 NH, the spinstretched state is \u03b215 , and lies below three levels from\nthe (fH , f ) = (1/2, 3/2) manifold, \u03b216 \u2013\u03b218 .\n\nB.\n\nScattering cross sections\n\nWe have carried out scattering calculations using the\nMOLSCAT package [43], as modified to handle collisions in external fields [41]. The coupled equations were\npropagated with the hybrid log-derivative Airy method\nof Alexander and Manolopoulos [44], using a fixed-stepsize log-derivative propagator for 2.5 \u2264 R \u2264 50 \u00c5, with\n\u2206R = 0.025 \u00c5, and a variable-step-size Airy propagator for 50 \u2264 R \u2264 250 \u00c5. To a good approximation, the\ncomputer time is dominated by operations on relatively\nlarge matrices that scale with the total number of channels N as \u221d N 3 . The time needed to perform a calculation including hyperfine interactions is thus approxi3\nmately [(2iN + 1)(2iH + 1)] = 216 times larger than that\nrequired for an equivalent calculation neglecting them.\nIn order to make our calculations tractable, the basis set\nused in the present work was reduced slightly from that\nused in Ref. [24], to nmax = 5 and Lmax = 6. Under\nthese conditions N \u2248 1, 500, with the actual number depending on the initial state, Mtot and P . The reduction\nin nmax and Lmax does not change the results by more\nthan about 5%.\nNH molecules that undergo transitions between hyperfine levels of the ms = +1 manifold remain in a magnetically trappable state. However, the associated kinetic\nenergy release ranges from 0.7 to 5.8 mK and will either heat the trapped gas or eject one or both collision\npartners from the trap. We will thus assume that all inelastic processes have a negative impact on the success\nof sympathetic cooling. In any case, as will be shown in\nSec. III B 3 a, transitions with \u2206ms = 0 do not contribute\nappreciably to inelasticity.\n\n\f6\n1.\n\nGeneral considerations\n\na. Analytical model. The total inelastic cross section may be decomposed into partial-wave contributions,\nX\n\u03c3\u03b2,inel =\n\u03c3\u03b2L\u2192\u03b2 0 L0 .\n(16)\n\u03b2 0 6=\u03b2,L,L0\n\nWhen inelastic scattering is weak compared to elastic\nscattering, the first-order distorted-wave Born approximation [45] provides relatively simple expressions for the\noff-diagonal S-matrix elements. Volpi and Bohn [46] gave\nan analytical formula for the threshold behavior of the\npartial inelastic cross sections under these conditions,\n0\n\n1\n\nL0 + 21\n\nL\u2212 2\nLL\n\u03c3\u03b2L\u2192\u03b2 0 L0 (E, B) = \u03c3\u03b2\u03b2\n[E + \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 (B)]\n0 E\n\n.\n(17)\nLL0\nHere, \u03c3\u03b2\u03b2\n0 is a factor independent of the collision energy\nE, while \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 is the kinetic energy released in the transition from the state \u03b2 to \u03b2 0 . This formula was used in\ninterpreting the energy and magnetic field dependence of\nhyperfine-free scattering cross sections in Mg + NH [24].\nWhen hyperfine terms are neglected, \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 in Eq. (17)\nLL0\nis simply \u2212gS \u03bcB B\u2206ms and \u03c3\u03b2\u03b2\n0 is independent of the\nmagnetic field strength B. However, when hyperfine\nterms are included, the B-dependence of \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 is much\nmore intricate, as seen in Fig. 1. In particular, for many\ntransitions, \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 does not approach zero at low magnetic fields. This has substantial effects below about\n50 G. At higher fields, \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 approaches its hyperfinefree form even when\nhyperfine interactions are included.\nLL0\nIn addition, \u03c3\u03b2\u03b2\nvaries\nwith B because the character of\n0\nthe NH eigenstates depends on the magnetic field.\nb. Relaxation\nmechanisms. The\nquantummechanical theory of electron spin relaxation in\ncollisions of 3 \u03a3 molecules with structureless atoms,\nneglecting hyperfine effects, was developed by Krems\nand Dalgarno [47]. In general, inelastic collisions are\ndriven by the anisotropy of the interaction potential, but\nthis does not have matrix elements that are off-diagonal\nin ms . Collisions that change ms thus occur only\nbecause it is not strictly a good quantum number, and\nbasis functions with different values of ms are mixed\nby terms in the monomer Hamiltonian. In the absence\nof hyperfine interactions, the only such terms are the\nspin-spin and spin-rotation Hamiltonians.\nIn the NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) case that we study here, \u03bbss \u001d \u03b3 and\nthe electron spin-spin terms are dominant. There are no\nmatrix elements of \u0124ss between n = 0 states, because\nmn cannot change from 0. In the absence of hyperfine\ninteractions, the effect of \u0124ss is to mix into the ground\nstate (ms , n, mn , ML ) = (ms , 0, 0, ML ) a small amount\nof rotationally excited functions (ms \u2212 q, 2, q, ML ) with\nq = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12. The potential anisotropy (principally V2 )\ncan then drive transitions between these mixed states.\nSpin relaxation for n = 0 states thus proceeds mainly\nvia the combination of the spin-spin interaction and the\npotential anisotropy, and leads to transitions with \u2206ms\n\ncompensated by a change in ML to conserve Mtot . If\nL = 0, this requires L0 > 0 and the corresponding cross\nsections are therefore centrifugally suppressed at low energies by barriers in the outgoing channels. In what follows, we will refer to this as the main relaxation mechanism.\nWhen hyperfine coupling is included, states with different values of ms and mi are strongly mixed at low\nfields. For the n = 0 states, this mixing is almost entirely due to the Fermi contact interactions. Under these\ncircumstances the main mechanism can drive all possible\ntransitions among the n = 0 states, although with varying degrees of centrifugal suppression as described below. However at high fields, once the Zeeman splittings\nare large compared to the Fermi contact interactions, ms\nand mi become nearly good quantum numbers. Since the\nmain mechanism does not affect the nuclear spin projections, there is a propensity for transitions with \u2206mi = 0.\n\n2.\n\nDependence on collision energy\n\nFig. 2 shows the elastic and total inelastic cross sections as a function of energy at magnetic fields B = 1, 10\nand 100 G, for collisions starting in the spin-stretched\nstate, \u03b215 = (fH , f, mf ) = (3/2, 5/2, +5/2), and the\ntwo highest-lying states, \u03b217 = (1/2, 3/2, +1/2) and\n\u03b218 = (1/2, 3/2, +3/2). At very low energies, the scattering of incoming partial waves with L 6= 0 is suppressed\nby centrifugal barriers; our calculations include all contributions from incoming s, p and d waves (L = 0 to 2),\nwhich gives integral cross sections that are converged at\ncollision energies up to about 40 mK. The dashed lines\nin Fig. 2 show pure s-wave cross sections, and it may be\nseen that collisions with L > 0 become significant above\nE \u2248 10\u22124 K.\nThe dependence on the magnetic field will be analyzed\nin detail in the next section. However, in general terms\nit is clear that at high fields (100 G and above), the cross\nsections including hyperfine interactions are quite similar\nto those from hyperfine-free calculations, while at lower\nfields they are very different. In particular, the suppression of inelastic cross sections that occurs in hyperfinefree calculations at low fields and low energies is much\nreduced (resulting in larger inelastic cross sections) when\nhyperfine interactions are included.\nThe major effect of hyperfine interactions is that, at\nlow fields, they increase the kinetic energy release and\nthus reduce the centrifugal suppression of the inelastic\nscattering. At 1 G, for example, the \u03b217 and \u03b218 states\ncan relax to channels with kinetic energy releases of up\nto 7.2 mK, while the corresponding value for the spinstretched \u03b215 state is only 2.6 mK. When hyperfine coupling is excluded, however, the kinetic energy release at\n1 G is only about 270 \u03bcK.\nFor simplicity, let us consider the case of s-wave scattering.

The corresponding final-state\nenergies are shown color-coded in the bottom panel.\nAt low fields, where the main mechanism can drive\nall possible transitions, the state-to-state cross sections\nare governed by the kinetic energy release. The largest\ncross section at E = 10\u22126 K is to \u03b240 = (3/2, 1/2, +1/2),\nclosely followed by \u03b270 and \u03b280 , which are (3/2, 3/2, +3/2)\nand (3/2, 3/2, +1/2) respectively.

Total s-wave inelastic cross sections. The behavior of the total s-wave inelastic cross sections with magnetic field, for the three initial states studied above, is\nshown in Fig. 5 for a range of collision energies.

(17) is independent of B, \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 is given\nby \u2212gS \u03bcB B\u2206ms , and three main regimes are observed\n[24]: (1) at low enough fields, the inelastic cross sections\nflatten out to a zero-field value proportional to E 2 ; (2)\nL=0\nas the field increases, \u03c3inel\nenters a region of B 5/2 dependence, given by the increasing probability of tunneling through the d-wave centrifugal barrier in the dominant outgoing channel(s); and (3) at high enough fields\n(above about 100 G) the d-wave centrifugal barriers are\nL=0\novercome and \u03c3inel\nagain approaches a field-independent\nvalue, this time proportional to E \u22121/2 .\nThe inclusion of hyperfine terms modifies both the\nqualitative behavior in regime (1) and the boundaries of\nregime (2). First, at very low fields and collision energies,\nthe state-to-state cross sections become nearly constant\nat a field-free value that is much larger than when hyperfine coupling is neglected. The kinetic energy release\nin this region is dominated by \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 , which for some\noutgoing channels does not approach zero as the field\ndecreases. The field-free cross section is proportional to\nE \u22121/2 at the lowest energies, though deviations from this\noccur at energies high enough that the outgoing energy is\nno longer dominated by \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 . Increasing the magnetic\nfield alters \u2206E\u03b2\u03b2 0 , particularly above \u223c10 G, but also\n0L0\nchanges \u03c3\u03b2\u03b2\n0 because the spin character of the monomer\neigenfunctions changes. This leads to a non-power-law\nincrease in the cross sections up to the onset of regime\n(2). It may again be noted that, although L0 = 0 is possible for initial states other than the spin-stretched state,\nthe hyperfine splitting at zero field provides enough kinetic energy release for the main mechanism to dominate\nspin relaxation, even though it is suppressed by d-wave\noutgoing barriers.\n\n0\ns\u2212wave inelastic cross section, \u03c3L\u03b2,=inel\n/\u00c52\n\nAs discussed above, for non-spin-stretched states such\nas \u03b218 it is possible to relax ms while conserving mf .\n0\nThis is the case for transitions to \u03b270 and \u03b214\n, which are\n0\ndominated by L = 0 and therefore are not centrifugally\nsuppressed.

Non-adiabatic transitions, which\nare one-body transitions that can occur at points in the\ntrap where different states are near-degenerate, have important consequences for trap design. In particular, it is\nwell known for atomic systems that substantial losses can\noccur at the center of magnetic quadrupole traps, where\nthe magnetic field is zero [48]. Near this point, states\nwith different values of mf are degenerate and the trapping field varies very fast with position, so that atoms\ncan undergo non-adiabatic transitions (Majorana flops\n[49]) when they pass close to the trap center. For atoms,\nMajorana transitions can be effectively suppressed by applying a small bias field (1 G or less) that removes the\nzero-field point. Similar effects have been observed for\nmolecules in electrostatic traps [50], and can again be\nsuppressed by applying a bias field.\nFor molecules there are crossings that occur at non-\n\n\f10\n\n7\n6\n\n1.5\n\n4\n1.0\n3\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0.0\n\n0\n\n\u03b215\n\n2.0\nlog10 (Magnetic field, B/G)\n\nlog10 \u03c3el /\u03c3inel\n\n5\n\n\u03b218\n\n7\n6\n\n1.5\n\n5\n4\n\n1.0\n3\n\nlog10 \u03c3el /\u03c3inel\n\nlog10 (Magnetic field, B/G)\n\n\u03b217\n\nexcluding hyperfine\n\n2.0\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0.0\n\u22127\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\nlog10 (Collision energy, E/K)\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121 \u22127\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\nlog10 (Collision energy, E/K)\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Contour plots of the ratio of elastic to total inelastic cross section as a function of collision energy and\nmagnetic field. The panels correspond to calculations excluding (top left) and including (rest) hyperfine terms. The lines show\nthe conditions sampled by 99.9% of molecules trapped in the ms = +1 state, in an unbiased trap (solid) and a trap with a bias\nfield of B = 1 G (dashed).\n\nzero field, as shown in Fig. 1. Magnetically trapped NH\nmolecules in states \u03b213 , \u03b214 and \u03b215 might conceivably\nundergo transitions to untrapped states \u03b210 , \u03b211 and \u03b212\nin the vicinity of crossings that occur between 15 and\n30 G. However, away from the trap center the molecules\nexperience a field that varies only slowly as they move,\nand under such circumstances the transition probabilities\nwill be very low. We therefore expect that a small bias\nfield of 1 G or less will be sufficient to suppress one-body\nlosses for NH and other similar molecules. Even if such\nlosses do prove significant, the states \u03b216 , \u03b217 and \u03b218 are\nimmune to them except near a zero-field point.\nThe major loss mechanism in sympathetic cooling\nthus arises from inelastic collisions. Provided that the\nabsolute values of the elastic cross sections are large\nenough to provide cooling before the molecules are lost\nto black-body radiation or non-adiabatic transitions, the\nkey quantity is the ratio of elastic to total inelastic cross\nsections, which must be greater than about 100 for sympathetic cooling to proceed.\nBoth Mg-NH and NH-NH [51, 52] collisions may cause\n\ntransitions to untrapped states or release enough energy\nto eject the molecules from the trap. Fig. 6 shows contour\nplots of the ratio of elastic to total inelastic cross section\nas a function of E and B for Mg-NH. The top-left panel\nshows the results when hyperfine terms are neglected,\nand the remainder show the results when hyperfine terms\nare included, for the spin-stretched and two highest-lying\nhyperfine states.\nTrapped NH molecules in state \u03b2 at temperature T\nwill be distributed according to a Boltzmann distribution\nwith density \u03c1 given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE\u03b2 (0) \u2212 E\u03b2 (B)\n\u03c1/\u03c10 = exp\n.\n(18)\nkB T\nAt any given temperature on the energy axis of Fig. 6,\nonly about 0.1% of molecules will experience fields corresponding to energies greater than 6kB T . The diagonal\nlines in Fig. 6 show the maximum fields sampled by over\n99.9% of the molecules trapped in one of the hyperfine\nlevels of the ms = +1 manifold. These correspond, respectively, to a unbiased trap with zero magnetic field\n\n\f11\nat the center (solid lines), and a trap with a bias field\nof 1 G, to prevent Majorana transitions (dashed lines).\nPre-cooled molecules would enter the trap from the righthand side of the panels in Fig. 6 and then move to the left\nas they are cooled, remaining below the line appropriate\nfor the trap in use.\nThe ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections exceeds\n100 at temperatures below 10 mK for all three hyperfine\nstates, and is thus favorable for sympathetic cooling to\nwork, provided the molecules can be precooled to this\ntemperature. This agrees with the hyperfine-free results\nof Wallis and Hutson [24]. At lower temperatures, the\nratios of elastic to inelastic collisions are not as favorable as in hyperfine-free calculations, but are nevertheless adequate to reach temperatures below 1 \u03bcK. Trapping molecules in the fully spin-stretched state may be\nparticularly advantageous, especially for molecules with\nstronger hyperfine interactions than NH.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the effect of hyperfine interactions on spin-relaxation collisions of NH with Mg in the\ncold and ultracold regimes. We find that hyperfine interactions make substantial changes to inelastic collision\nrates at temperatures below about 10 mK and magnetic\nfields below about 20 G. The major effect arises because\nhyperfine interactions modify the kinetic energy released\nin spin-relaxation collisions. When hyperfine interactions\nare neglected, the kinetic energy decreases to zero as the\nfield is decreased, but when hyperfine interactions are included the kinetic energy release is significant for most\ntransitions even at zero field. For s-wave collisions, the\nkinetic energy release helps overcome the d-wave centrifugal barriers that suppress spin-relaxation collisions and\nthus leads to larger inelastic cross sections.\nHyperfine interactions also introduce new mechanisms\nfor spin-relaxation collisions. For initial states that are\nnot spin-stretched, the cross sections for some of these are\ncentrifugally unsuppressed. However, for Mg-NH, where\nthe hyperfine interactions are quite weak, the centrifugally unsuppressed mechanisms make only a small contribution to total inelastic cross sections at the collision\nenergies and fields studied here. It is nevertheless possible that centrifugally unsuppressed channels may be important in other systems, with either stronger hyperfine\ninteractions or weaker competing spin relaxation mecha-\n\n[1] L.

Other hyperfine terms\nhave only very small effects for transitions between n =\n0 states. Indeed, we have repeated the calculations of\nthe state-to-state cross sections including only the Fermi\ncontact interactions and obtain almost identical results.\nOur results for Mg-NH(3 \u03a3\u2212 ) may be compared with\nthose of Tscherbul et al. [34] for He-YbF(2 \u03a3). For YbF\nthe main mechanism of electron spin relaxation considered here, driven by the electron spin-spin coupling, does\nnot exist and is replaced by a higher-order and much\nweaker mechanism driven by the spin-rotation interaction. Under these circumstances, combined electron and\nnuclear spin relaxation, driven by the electron-nuclear\ndipolar interaction, is in relative terms much more important. However, Tscherbul et al. did not focus on the\nregime where hyperfine energies make important contributions to the kinetic energy release.\nWe have considered the prospects for sympathetic cooling of NH by Mg, which were previously explored in\nhyperfine-free calculations by Wallis and Hutson [24]. We\nhave calculated the ratio of the elastic to inelastic cross\nsection as a function of energy and magnetic fields for several magnetically trappable hyperfine states of NH. Even\nthough hyperfine interactions increase inelastic cross sections at low energies and magnetic fields, the ratio remains high enough for sympathetic cooling to proceed if\nthe NH molecules can be pre-cooled to about 10 mK.\nMolecular hyperfine interactions are also likely to be\nimportant in developing techniques for controlling ultracold molecules. The low-lying excited states afforded\nby hyperfine splittings can support near-threshold levels that will produce magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances. Once molecules such as NH have been cooled to\nthe ultracold regime, it will be possible to use such resonances both to control collisions by adjusting the scattering length and to create polyatomic molecules by magnetoassociation, as has already been achieved for alkalimetal atoms [13, 14].\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to EPSRC for funding.\n\nDruten, D.
