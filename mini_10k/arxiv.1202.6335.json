Variation of peak position of donor bound exciton transition (D1XA\n) and FXAn=1-1LO with pump intensity show red shift and blue shift respectively due to\nexciton-exciton scattering. EPR spectra reveals three peaks at g value of 1.985 , 1.956\nand 1.939 respectively, g=1.956 and g=1.985 is due to shallow donors Zn interstitial and\noxygen vacancy respectively An EPR spectrum at 100 K reveals higher degree of\nasymmetry and hyperfine splitting due to crystal field and inhomogeneous relaxation of\nparamagnetic centers. Strength of crystal field splitting (CFS) and spin orbit coupling\n(SOC) in sample is discussed using PL peak position of various excitonic emissions.\nWhereas, inhomogeneous relaxation of paramagnetic centers is discussed in terms of\ntheir activation energy during thermal quenching process.\n\nbound exciton varies from sample to\nsample, for example, the position of\nmost intense line in PL profile of ZnO\nhas been reported from 3.3624 to 3.3628\neV by different groups.7,11-16 ZnO is ntype material with dominant donor being\neither a native defect such as oxygen\nvacancy (V0) and/or the zinc interstitial (\nKrooger assigned V0, zinc\nZni).17\nvacancy (VZn) as dominant donor and\nacceptor respectively.18 It has been\nconcluded that neural oxygen vacancies\nare considered to be a major component\nof the defect structure of ZnO. EPR and\nfirst principal calculations show that V0\nis deep donor.19-21 Hall measurement on\nelectron irradiated ZnO have provided\nsupporting evidence that zinc interstitials\nmay be a residual shallow donor.22 In\nthis paper, we report low temperature PL\nstudy in temperature range of 6K-200K\nand EPR measurement in temperature\nrange of 275-100 K of sintered bulk\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nZinc oxide is a semi-conducting material\nused in variety of applications, ranging\nfrom sunscreen lotion and talcum\npowder to piezoelectric transducers and\nphosphors.1,2 The band gap structure and\noptical properties of ZnO are similar to\nGaN, however, it has advantage over\nGaN in terms of strong binding energy\nof excitons. Higher binding energy of\nexciton (60 meV) in ZnO makes it a\npotential candidate for optoelectronic\ndevices and ultra violet LEDs. 3,4 The\nlow temperature PL profile of ZnO\nsingle crystal has been investigated by\nseveral researchers,5-10 . It has been\nwidely reported that PL profile of ZnO\nat low temperature comprises of several\nbound and free exciton transitions and a\ndominating line is due to neutral bound\nexciton. The peak position of neutral\n\n1\n\n\fpolycrystalline ZnO. Since we used\npulsed laser as an excitation source,\nhence, dynamics of donor bound exciton\nwith excitation intensity (local heating)\nand with temperature (bulk heating) is\nalso discussed.\n\ncalibration with hollow cathode neon\nlamp provides dispersion of 0.05\nnm/pixel. PL peak position was\ndetermined with respect to excitation\nwavelength with accuracies of \u00b1 1meV.\nThe excited exciton density nex within\nthe sample by UV illumination is\ncalculated using rate equation nex=\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nZnO samples were prepared by cold\npress of ZnO powder 99.999% (SigmaAldrich) at pressure of 6 Ton followed\nby sintering at 1000 0C in air for five\nhours. In order to see the effect of\nsintering on crystal structure and stress,\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the\nsample were taken before and after\nsintering using CuK\uf061 source (\u03bb=1.54\nA0). Steady-state PL measurement was\ncarried out with sintered sample placed\nin a closed cycle cryostat (ARS, Model\n830) in the temperature range of 6-250\nK. Third harmonic of Nd:YAG ( DCR4G, Spectra Physics \u03bb=355 nm, 4 nanosecond pulse duration, 10 Hz repetition\nrate, 2 mJ/pulse energy ) was used as\nexcitation source. Laser was focused on\nthe sample with help of lens; excitation\narea was circular of diameter 400 \u03bcm.\nThe emission light was collected by a\nlens,\nimaged\nonto\nfiber-coupled\nmonochromator ( Sahmrock SR 303i,\nAndor Technology) and detected by\nintensified charge couple device (ICCD\nDH720, Andor Technology). ICCD was\noperated in gating mode and emission\nwas collected for one microsecond ( gate\nwidth one micro-second) after laser\npulse ( gate delay zero) because\ndiffusion of excited exciton out of the\nfocal volume/excited volume can be\nneglected at this time scale. Spectral\nresolution of spectrograph was ascertain\nusing grating property and active area of\nICCD. Grating of 1200 lines/mm, 1.66\nnm/mm dispersion and 750 pixel (active\narea of ICCD, 1 pixel=25 micron) gives\nobservation window of 31 nm. Further,\n\n\uf068\uf06c\n\n\uf074 Fx p . Where P is the excitation\ndhc\nintensity, \u03bb, h, c is the excitation\nwavelength, plank's constant, velocity\nof light in vacuum respectively . d ( \u2248\n500 nm) is the thickness of active layer,\n\u03c4Fx (\u2248 1x 10-9 sec ) is radiative life time\nof free excitons and \u03b7 is coupling\nefficiency .23,24\n\u03b7 is deduced by\nassuming 14% of light is reflected from\nthe sample and quartz window and most\n50% of excitation intensity is converted\nto create electron-hole pair. This leads to\nthe exciton density of 1018-1020 cm-3\nwithin focal volume with increase of\nexcitation intensity from 9.10 kW-cm-2\nto 3.87 MW-cm-2. Further assuming\nexcitation area as cylinder of length \u03b1-1\n(\u03b1=2 x 105 cm-1 at 355 nm) and diameter\n400 micron and exciton density \u2248 1020\ncm-3 gives average separation between\nexcitons (<rex>) of about 100 A0 .25 This\nimplies that <rex> is almost three times\nlarger than exciton diameter (35 A0).\nThese calculations also agree with\nKlingshrin, who propose that maximum\ngeneration rate of exciton with excitation\npower of 500 kW-cm-2 in fundamental\nedge with UV illumination can be taken\nas 1029 cm2-sec-1. This assumption also\ngives exciton density of order of 1020\ncm-3. 26, 27 These calculations suggest\nthat exciton-exciton interaction is very\nstrong in our case. Whereas, formation\nof new complex like bi-exciton or\nexciton molecules is less likely and\nformation of electron \u2013hole plasma\n(EHP) is negligible.\nThe EPR\n2\n\n\fexperiment\nwas\nperformed\nin\ntemperature range of 275-100K, with\nmicrowave frequency 9.412 GHz, and\n2mW power (Bruker BioSpin). The g\nvalue was calculated using DPPH (2,2Diphenyl, 1-picryl hydrazyl, g= 2.0036)\nas reference. For EPR measurements\nsintered ZnO powder was placed in a\nglass tube (~15 cm long, 6 mm inner\ndiameter, 8 mm outer diameter). Sample\ntube was evacuated to 10-5 torr, and a\nflame from torch was used to remove\ncontamination from the surface. The\ntorch was then used to seal the tube\nwhile maintaining the vacuum inside.\n\nhaving\nmulti\ndiffraction\npeaks\ncorresponding to [100], [002], [101],\n[102], [110] and [103] plane. XRD\nspectra of sintered ZnO get shifted\ntowards higher angle and FWHM (full\nwidth at half maxima) of peaks\ndecreases. Average grain size is\ncalculated by using FWHM of all\ndiffraction peaks. Grain size is found to\nbe 19nm and 28 nm, before and after\nsintering respectively. Increase of grain\nsize after sintering indicates that grain\ngrowth is driven by the grain boundary\nsurface tension. Decrease/increase of\nFWHM/grain size of diffraction peak\nafter sintering is in consistence with\nearlier reported results.2\nWidth of XRD peaks is due to grain size\n( Bsize), strain (Bstrain) and instrumental\nbroadening (Binst). Therefore, total\nwidth can be written as.28\n\nIII. RESULTS AND\nDISCUSSION\nFigure 1 shows , XRD spectra of\nsintered and un-sintered ZnO sample,\nsolid line and dotted line are XRD peak\nof un-sintered and sintered ZnO powder\nrespectively. XRD spectra reveals that\nsample is polycrystalline in nature\n\nFigure 1. XRD spectra of sintered and un-sintered ZnO sample, inset shows Wilson-Hal\nplot of sintered and un-sintered ZnO sample.\n\n3\n\n\fB total (cos\u03b8)/\u03bb =\n0 .9 / t \uf02b 2\n\n\uf044d\nsin \uf071 / \uf06c \uf02b Binst cos \uf071 / \uf06c\nd\n\nFXBn=1, we have assigned the emission\npeak at 3.391 eV as FXBn=1,. The\nobserved energy separation of FXAn=1\nand FXBn=1 is 13 meV, close to predicted\nexperimental value of 9-15 meV.15, 30, 31\nTransition energy of FXAn=2 is less then\nearlier reported value of 3.422 eV. This\nis due to polycrystalline nature of\nsample. We did not observe any\nsignature of C exciton because it is\nexpected that C excitons are thermalised\ndown to lower exciton level at low\ntemperature.\nAt 6K most intense\ntransition is due to donor bound exciton\nD1XA appearing at 3.347 eV. This line\ncorresponds to A-excitons bound to\nshallow donor with spectral width\n(FWHM) of 15 meV. Due to large\nspectral width, D1XA seems to be\nenvelop of two peaks at 3.347 and 3.354\neV respectively. Thus, it is expected that\nA exciton is bound to two different\nshallow donors.\n\n1\n\nWhere, first term\nis Debye-Scherrer term, second term is\nstrain term and third term is\ninstrumental broadening. Slope of plot\nof B total cos\u03b8/\u03bb Vs sin\u03b8/ \u03bb as shown in\ninset of figure 1 gives strain. Since,\n\u2206d/d\nis\nreduced\non\nsintering\ninhomogeneous strain can be ruled out\nwhereas, homogeneous strain may be\npresent in sample because of observed\nasymmetry of XRD line as shown in\nfigure 1.\nFigure 2 shows the PL profile at 6K, the\nPL peaks position is determined by\naveraging the PL profile over ten data\npoints. In figure 2(a) the free excitonic\ntransition is observed due to energy state\nn=1(FXAn=1) and first excited energy\nstate n=2 (FXAn=2) at 3.378 eV and 3.414\neV respectively close to the predicted\nvalue of A exciton. 28, 29 Following the\nreported energy separation of FXAn=1 and\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 2.

Energy\ndifference between FXn=1A and (e, A0)\ntransition is 191 eV close to the reported\nvalue of 195 meV.8, 11 In order to\nconfirm the dominance of bound exciton\ntransition at low temperature. Variation\nof PL peak position and PL peak\nintensity with temperature is shown in\nfigure 3.\nVariation of PL peak position of D 1XA\nversus temperature is shown as solid\npoints and fitted with Varshni's formula,\n\nPresence of two different donors was\nverified by EPR experiment and\ndiscussed in next section. The other\npeaks observed on lower energy side of\nmain PL profile are assigned as LO\nreplicas of FXAn=1. Phonon replica\noccurs due to free exciton transition as\nwell as due to bound exciton transition.\nFirst (1LO), second (2LO) and third\n(3LO) longitudinal optical phonon\nreplica of FXAn=1 appears as a shoulder\nat 3.306, 3.236 and 3.167 eV\nrespectively in main PL profile, whereas,\n1LO phonon replica of D 1XA appear at\n3.275 eV.

Assuming negligible\nkinetic energy of bound excitons\ncomparable to free exciton, peak energy\nfor bound excitons can be written as\n1\nh\uf077 BX \uf03d E BX \uf02d EbBX (1 \uf02d 2 ) , hence D1XA\nn\nis red shifted by 9 meV. This is in\nagreement with experimental result.\nAbove said statement is mostly valid for\nexciton \u2013exciton interaction processes.\nInorder to show that exciton-exciton\ninteraction is dominate process in our\ncase figure 4(b) shows the shift of D 1XA\nline (\u0394E) with increase of excitation\nintensity (P) at different temperature. It\nshows power law behavior as \u0394E \u2248 P\n0.90\u00b1.03\nat 6K, whereas other process like\nexciton-electron interaction and EHP\ninteraction shows power law as \u0394E \u2248\nP2/3. 26 Therefore, red shift of D 1XA is\ndue to exciton-exciton scattering.34.\nA general relationship for the emission\nlines involving phonon and exciton\nemission\ncan\nbe\nwritten\nas\n,\nEn \uf03d E0 \uf02d (nh\uf077LO \uf02d \uf044E ) ,\n\nWhere T is the absolute temperature,\nEg(0) is the band gap energy at T=0, and\n\u03b3 and \u03b2 are constants.

PL\npeak position shifts towards higher\nenergy\nside\nwith\ndecrease\nin\ntemperature. This behavior of sample is\ndue to lattice contraction at lower\ntemperatures. Using x-ray powder\ndiffraction it has been shown that lattice\nparameter a decrease from 3.250 A0 to\n3.247 A0 with decrease in temperature\nfrom 296 to 4 K.33 We also estimated the\nexciton donor binding energy from the\ndifference between the bound exciton (D\n1XA) energy and the free exciton energy.\nThe exciton donor binding energy is\nroughly 24 meV.

The spectral line shape\nI(LO) of FXn=1A \u2013 1LO has the form\nE\nwhere E\nI ( LO ) \uf0bb E 1 / 2 exp( \uf02d\n) P( E )\n\n\uf0ec\ne2\ne2 a \uf0fc\nh\uf077 \uf03d E g \uf02d \uf0ed( E D \uf02b E A \uf02d\n\uf02d ( )( ) 6 \uf0fd\n\uf065rDA\n\uf065 rDA \uf0fe\n\uf0ee\n\nwhere \u03b5 is dielectric constant, a is\neffective Vander Waals coefficient for\nthe interaction between neutral donor\nand neutral acceptor, and rDA is distance\nbetween neutral donor and acceptor\nrespectively.

The results for A and B\nfree exciton transition energy are in\naccordance with previous published\nwork, whereas, most intense peak of\nD1XA is at lower energy than earlier\npublished results. Based on correlated\nmagnetic resonance experiment, Meyer\nel-al14 suggested that neutral donor\nbound peak at 3.3628 eV is due to\nexciton bound to hydrogen and it easily\nannihilated by annealing at higher\ntemperature (T> 800 0C). Since, we use\nsintered sample at 1000 0C, therefore, it\nis expected that donor bound exciton at\n3.3628 eV is annihilated, thus not seen\nin main PL profile. Annealing studies\nalso show that as the annealing\ntemperature is increased, the higher\nenergy PL peaks disappear and at\nannealing temperature of 800 0C\nessentially, all of the emission intensity\ngoes into the lower energy emission\npeak, which is due to nearest neighbor\nalignment. Sintering at 1000 0C results\nin defect diffusion and produces nearest\nneighbor defect pairs. The PL spectrum\nof this defect pairs shows polarization\nproperties. The details of PL study of\ndefect pairs are described elsewhere.7\nFigure 5 (a) shows the EPR spectra of\nsintered ZnO in temperature range of\n275K-100K, a standard sample (DPPH)\nof known g ( 2.0036) value is used as\nreference to find out exact value of g.\nEPR line of DPPH and ZnO occurs at\n3366\nGauss\nand\n3445\nGauss\nrespectively. Interestingly an EPR\nspectrum of ZnO at 100K seems very\nasymmetric. For clarity, it is re-plotted in\n\nfigure 5(b), while inset shows the\nintegrated EPR spectra. It has three\npeaks at g value of 1.985 (I), 1.956 (II)\nand 1.939 (III). EPR at g=1.956 and\ng=1.985 is due to shallow donors Zn\ninterstitial\nand\noxygen\nvacancy\nrespectively. Central peak (II) is very\nasymmetric; and seems as envelop of\ntwo lines as shown with dotted line with\ng value at 1.959 and 1.957. Asymmetry\nof peak (II) indicates that two different\nshallow donors are present in ZnO.\nThese donors have almost identical g\nvalues, which prohibit their clear\nseparation. Hofman et al has resolved\nthe two type of donor with pulsed 95\nGHz EPR spectrometer.16 They observe\ng= 1.9569 and 1.9571 for two donor.\nThis is in close agreement with our\nexperiment. Anisotropy in sintered ZnO\nare due to defect diffusion, VO, Zni, VZn\nor combination of all. Zni is known to\ndiffuse at temperature around 500 0C.38\nCombination of\nlocal density\napproximation ( LDA) and correlation\nenergy (U) also supports anisotropy in\nZnO.39 It has been shown that lattice\nrelaxations around V0 are large and very\ndifferent in different charge states (V+ 0,\nV++ 0). For V0, the four Zn nearest\nneighbor are displaced inward by 12% of\nequilibrium Zn-O bond length, whereas,\nfor V+ 0 and V++ 0 the displacement are\noutward by 2% and 23 %. Thermal\nactivation energy of donors can also be\nestimated by temperature dependence of\nPL peak intensity using equation 3. In\nthis case, sample temperature was kept\nconstant while, excitation intensity was\nvaried from 0.5 MW-cm-2 to 4.4 MWcm-2. The thermal activation energy of\nexciton is estimated from the theoretical\nfit of equation 3.\n\n10\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n11\n\n\f(c)\n\n(d)\nFigure 5.

Since, increase of excitation\nintensity causes increase of temperature\nwithin focal volume hence further\naffecting the lattice relaxation and defect\npair rearrangement. Activation energy of\ndonor varies from 12-31 meV with\nincrease of excitation intensity from 1.82\nMW-cm-2 to 4.4 MW-cm-2.\n\nFigure 6.

Inset shows\nvariation of PL peak intensity with temperature at different excitation intensity, solid line\nis theoretical fit of equation 2 to experimental data points.\n\n13\n\n\fFurther, in order to investigate whether\nour EPR signal corresponds to two\ndonors as suggested by 95 GHz EPR and\nHall measurement,16 we carried out two\ntype of analysis. (i) We investigate the\ntemperature dependence of EPR peak\nintensity (ii) variation of peak-to-peak\nwidth of EPR signal with temperature.\nFigure 5(c) shows the variation\nof EPR peak intensity with temperature.\nTo analyze this behavior we used the\nfollowing expression 16\n4\nI EPR (0)\nI EPR (T ) \uf03d\n\n1 \uf02b K 1 exp( \uf02d\n\n(SOC) in sample was calculated using\nPL data.

This calculation\nyields CFS= 42 meV and SOC= -20\nmeV. CFS is in accordance with\nprevious reported value of 31 meV.\n\nIV CONCLUSION\n\nE1\nE\n) \uf02b K 2 exp( \uf02d 2 )\n2k B T\n2k B T\n\nIn\nconclusion,\nphotoluminescence\nprofile of polycrystalline bulk ZnO at 6\nK is dominated by donor bound exciton\npeak with lower energy, while other free\nexciton transitions are in accordance\nwith PL profile of single crystalline\nZnO. EPR result at 100K shows that\nsintering at high temperature causes rearrangement of defect structure and form\nnew defect pairs. It is worth mentioning\nthat the observed behavior is due to in\nhomogeneous\nstrain\nand\nlattice\nrelaxation around oxygen vacancy.\nDominance of 1LO peak at room\ntemperature is due to shift of DBE PL\npeak toward lower energy side and 1LO\npeak towards higher energy side with\nincrease in pump intensity.\n\nWhere, Ei ( i=1,2) is the thermal\nactivation of the process i with pre factor\nKi. It is evident that EPR peak intensity\ndecreases with increase of temperature.\nThis is because at low temperature both\ndonors are in paramagnetic state. When\ntemperature\nis\nincreased\ndonors\nelectrons are released in conduction\nband leaving them in positive\ndiamagnetic charged state. Dotted line is\nthe theoretical fit of equation 4 to the\nexperimental data points . This yields\nE1=18 meV ( T~216 K )and E2= 44.6\nmeV ( T~530 K). Hofmann,16 also show\ntwo type of donor in broad temperature\nrange (40K-300K) with thermal\nactivation energy in range of 35 meV\nand 66 meV. Figure 5(d) show variation\nof peak-to \u2013peak line width (\u03b4) defined\nas the width between points of maximum\nsignal (positive and negative). \u03b4\ndecreases from 3.53 Gauss to 2.82 Gauss\nwith decrease in temperature from 300K\nto 200K. Further, \u03b4 increase from 2.82\nGauss to 7 Gauss with decrease in\ntemperature from 200K to 100K. The\nincrease of \u03b4 below 200K indicates\nstrong\nspin-orbit\nand/or\ndipolar\ninteraction. Strength of crystal field\nsplitting (CFS) and spin orbit coupling\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nAuthor, would like to thank professor\nRanjan Das, Department of Chemical\nSciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental\nResearch Mumbai India, for providing\nfacility for Low temperature EPR\nmeasurement.
