We report TIMMI2 diffraction-limited mid-IR images of the\nmultipolar PPN IRAS 16594-4656. By using the Lucy-Richardson deconvolution algorithm we recover a two-peaked morphology in the innermost\nregion at 8.6 \u03bcm and 11.5 \u03bcm. We interpret the observed mid-IR structure as the detection of the two limb-brightened peaks indicating the\npresence of a dusty toroidal structure in IRAS 16594-4656. We find that\nthe supposed biconical openings of the dust torus are in good agreement\nwith one of the bipolar outflows identified in the HST optical images.\n\n1.\n\nIRAS 16594-4656\n\nIRAS 16594-4656 (GLMP 507; hereafter I16594) was identified as a protoplanetary nebula (PPN) candidate on the basis of its IRAS colours by Volk\n& Kwok (1989). It shows a double-peaked spectral energy distribution which is\ndominated by a strong mid- to far- infrared peak caused by dust emission that\nis much brighter than the peak in the near-infrared. The HST optical images\nshow the presence of a bright central star surrounded by a multiple-axis bipolar\nnebulosity (dominated by scattered light) with a complex morphology at some\nintermediate viewing angle (Hrivnak, Kwok & Su 1999).\nThere are several proofs of the presence of a circumstellar disc or torus (as\nan equatorial density enhancement) in I16594. The highly collimated structure\nseen in the HST optical images and the non-detected radio-continuum emission\nby van de Steene & Pottasch (1993) indicate that the emission lines observed in\nthe optical spectrum are the result of the shock excitation produced by a fast\n1\n\nConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u0131\u0301ficas, CSIC\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Hern\u00e1ndez et al.\n\nbipolar wind from the central source. In agreement with this hypothesis Garc\u0131\u0301aHern\u00e1ndez et al. (2002) detected H2 shock-excited emission in the direction of\nI16594. In addition, Su et al. (2003) observed 10% polarization around the\ncentral source, suggesting the presence of a circumstellar torus.\nAll previous studies of I16594 confirm the basic model of PPNe where an\nenhancement of the equatorial density (torus) could obscure the central star in\nvisible light and is collimating the fast wind proceeding from the central star.\nThis model can be tested by obtaining high-resolution mid-IR images of I16594.\nvan de Steene, van Hoof, & Wood (2000) did not detect extended emission in\ntheir N-band images of I16594, but they observed with a pixel scale of 0.66\u2032\u2032 , the\nweather conditions were very poor and they did not correct for the PSF effects.\n2.\n\nMid-IR observations and data reduction\n\nThe observations were carried out in 2001 October 9 with the TIMMI2 midIR camera coupled to ESO 3.6m telescope (La Silla). TIMMI2 has an array\nof 320 x 240 pixels with a pixel scale of 0.2\u2032\u2032 x 0.2\u2032\u2032 . The observational conditions were very good and we obtained the mid-IR images (at 8.6 \u03bcm[N1] and\n11.5 \u03bcm[N11.9]) at the diffraction limit of the telescope. We used the standard\nnodding/chopping mid-IR observational technique and the basic data reduction\nprocess to obtain a final image per filter. The flux calibration was made using\nthe averaged conversion factors derived from the observations of a number of\nstandard stars at different air masses. We removed the effects of the PSF by\nusing the Lucy-Richardson deconvolution algorithm implemented in IRAF in\norder to recover the emission structure for each filter. In Figure 1 we display the\noriginal/raw images with the corresponding deconvolved ones for every filter.\n3.\n\nRaw and deconvolved mid-IR morphology of the nebula\n\nWe can identify two main mid-IR emission regions in I16594 in the two filters\n(see Figure 1, left). An extended halo which is approximately elliptical (\u226440% of\nthe peak intensity) and an elongated emission core (>40% of the peak intensity).\nWe fitted the emission halo with elliptical isophotes in order to determine the\nsource centre. This was determined by averaging the central coordinates of the\nisophotes with 20\u221240% of the peak intensity to avoid any contamination from\nthe core structure. The images displayed in Figure 1 have been centred on this\nposition. Because the central star has a B7 spectral type (van de Steene, Wood,\n& van Hoof 2000), no contribution in 10 \u03bcm to the flux observed is expected.\nIn addition, Hrivnak, Kwok, & Su (1999) found that the contribution of the\nphotospheric component to the total flux in the mid-IR is only \u223c 3%. For this\nreason, we have considered the photospheric contribution negligible.\nThe deconvolved N1 and N11.9 images are shown in Figure 1 on the right.\nWe recover a two-peaked morphology in the innermost region in the two filters.\nThe two detected peaks are approximately orientated along the north-south\ndirection (P.A.\u223c\u221210\u2212170\u25e6 ) and we can define a symmetry axis in the eastwestern direction (P.A.\u223c80\u2212260\u25e6 ). We interpret the mid-IR morphology seen\nin the deconvolved images as the evidence of the two limb-brightened peaks\ncorresponding to a dusty toroidal structure in I16594. We are sure that the\n\n\fMid-IR Structure of IRAS 16594-4656\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\nRaw mid-IR images of I16594 in N1 (8.6 \u03bcm) and N11.9\n(11.5 \u03bcm) filters (left, from top to bottom) and the corresponding deconvolved images (right). The thick marks show relative offsets from\nthe centre of the nebula in arc seconds. Contours range from 10% to\n90% of the peak intensity (in steps of 10%) and we have added the outermost contours, which correspond to 5% of the peak intensity. The\ninsets show the standard star PSFs in each filter.\nI16594 deconvolved structure is real for two reasons: first because we have a\nlarge signal-to-noise ratio in the raw images and second we obtain a similar\nemission structure in N1 and N11.9. Otherwise, we find that the north-peak\n(P.A.\u223c\u221210\u25e6 ) is brighter and more extended than the other. Ueta et al. (2001)\nfound a similar asymmetric appearance in IRAS 22272+5435.\n4.\n\nEvidence for precession in IRAS 16594-4656\n\nWe infer pairs of elongated structures with at least four different bipolar axis at\nP.A. \u223c34\u25e6 , \u223c54\u25e6 , \u223c84\u25e6 and \u223c124\u25e6 from the HST optical images. The presence of\ndifferent bipolar axis suggests that material has been ejected episodically from a\nprecessing/rotating source. Similar structures are also detected in more evolved\nPNe (e.g. Guerrero & Manchado 1998). We have displayed the I16594 optical\nHST image (taken from the HST Data Archive) overlaid with the contours of the\ndeconvolved mid-IR images in Figure 2. We find that the mid-IR emission symmetry axis approximately coincides with the bipolar axis located at P.A.\u223c84\u25e6 .\n\n\f4\n\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Hern\u00e1ndez et al.\n\nFigure 2.\nOptical HST image of I16594 (taken from the HST Data\nArchive) overlaid with contours of the deconvolved mid-IR images in\nthe N1 (8.6 \u03bcm) and N11.9 (11.5 \u03bcm) filters. The displaying conventions follow those of Fig.1. The big arrows indicate the directions of the\noptical prominences that coincide with the supposed biconical openings\nof the dust torus. The other bipolar axis directions identified in I16594\nhave been marked with small arrows.\nThe optical prominences towards the west (P.A.\u223c260\u25e6 ) and east (P.A.\u223c80\u25e6 ) are\nin good agreement with the supposed biconical openings of the dust torus. This\nfinding may thus indicate that the ejected material proceeding from the central\nsource is at present collimated by the dust torus along the east-west direction\n(P.A.\u223c80\u2212260\u25e6 ). The other bipolar outflows may be the result of episodic mass\nloss processes and could be the signature of a precessing system.\nAcknowledgments.
