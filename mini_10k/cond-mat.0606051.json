The final decay of the average intensity autocorrelation function is well\ndescribed by g2 (q, \u03c4 ) \u2212 1 \u223c exp[\u2212(\u03c4 /\u03c4f )p ], with \u03c4f \u223c q \u22121 and p decreasing from 1.5 to 1\nwith increasing q. We show that the dynamics is not due to a continuous ballistic process,\nas proposed in previous works, but rather to rare, intermittent rearrangements. We quantify\nthe dynamical fluctuations resulting from intermittency by means of the variance \u03c7(\u03c4, q) of\nthe instantaneous autocorrelation function, the analogous of the dynamical susceptibility \u03c74\nstudied in glass formers. The amplitude of \u03c7 is found to grow linearly with q. We propose\na simple \u2013yet general\u2013 model of intermittent dynamics that accounts for the q dependence of\nboth the average correlation functions and \u03c7.\n\nSoft matter systems where the constituents are packed at high volume fraction or interact\nstrongly have a dynamical behavior reminiscent of that of molecular glasses [1]: they exhibit\nvery slow relaxations, non-exponential response or correlation functions, history-dependent\ndynamics, and dynamical heterogeneity [2]. However, soft glassy systems may also exhibit\npeculiar dynamical features not found in hard glasses. An example is provided by low volume\nfraction colloidal gels resulting from the aggregation of strongly attractive particles. In these\ngels, the decay of the intensity correlation function g2 (q, \u03c4 ) \u2212 1 measured by dynamic light\nscattering is steeper than exponential and the relaxation time, \u03c4f , has an anomalous q \u22121 dependence on the scattering vector [3]. This \"compressed\" exponential, ballistic-like dynamics\nhas to be contrasted with the stretched exponential relaxations and the diffusive behavior\n(\u03c4f \u223c q \u22122 ) usually found in molecular systems [1]. Quite intriguingly, this unusual dynamics\nis not restricted to dilute colloidal gels, but has been observed recently in a large variety of\nsoft systems with both attractive and repulsive interactions [4\u201310].\nFor colloidal gels, it has been proposed that the dynamics be due to the continuous evolution of strain fields set by dipolar sources of internal stress [3, 5, 11]. At a microscopic level,\nstress is presumably accumulated by changes in the local structure driven by the formation\nof new bonds and/or bond breaking, which constitute elementary steps in the direction of\na more stable, compact structure. More generally, a similar continuous evolution of dipolar\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nstrain fields has been invoked to explain the ballistic-like dynamics of other systems exhibiting\na compressed exponential relaxation of g2 [4\u201310].\nTime-resolved light scattering experiments performed on similar gels [12] have suggested\nthat the dynamics be temporally heterogeneous, thus challenging the arguments of refs. [3,5,11]\nthat are based on a continuous dynamics [13]. However, these experiments were performed\non samples at much higher concentration (\u03c6 \u223c 0.1 as opposed to 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 ) and in the\nmultiple scattering regime, where the dynamics in probed on much shorter length scales (less\nthan a particle size as opposed to hundreds of particle sizes). Whether their outcome might\nbe extrapolated to single scattering experiments on diluted gels at low q is thus still unclear,\nespecially since time-resolved light scattering measurements in the same low-q range as that of\nref. [3] failed to evidence any significant temporal heterogeneity [14]. Clarifying the nature and\nthe physical origin of the dynamics of the gels is particularly important, given the widespread\noccurrence of similar dynamics in soft glassy materials.\nIn this Letter, we tackle these issues by studying the dynamics of strongly attractive\ncolloidal gels in a range of q vectors about one decade higher than in [3] and using timeresolved dynamic light scattering. We find that at all q the final relaxation of the average\nintensity correlation function g2 (q, \u03c4 ) \u2212 1 is well fitted by a compressed exponential with\nthe same q \u22121 dependence of \u03c4f as observed previously [3], and with a compressing exponent\np > 1. While at the lowest q p \u2248 1.5, the exponent unexpectedly decreases with increasing q,\neventually approaching one. We demonstrate that the dynamics is intermittent and quantify\nthe resulting fluctuations of g2 by means of a \"multipoint\" correlation function \u03c7 analogous\nto the dynamical susceptibility \u03c74 introduced in simulations of glass formers [15\u201317]. We find\nthat \u03c7 increases linearly with q and introduce a general model of intermittent dynamics that\naccounts for both the average dynamics and its temporal fluctuations.\nThe gels are made of polystyrene particles of radius 10 nm suspended in a buoyancy\nmatching mixture of H2 O and D2 O (45/55 by volume). Particles are mixed with a MgCl2\nsolution in order to induce aggregation in the DLCA regime [18]. The final particle volume\nfraction and salt concentration are \u03c6 = 6\u00d710\u22124 and 10 mM, respectively. A gelled structure is\nobtained after about 2 hours, formed by interconnected fractal clusters of radius Rc \u2248 10 \u03bcm,\nas revealed by static light scattering [3,18]. The dynamics of the gel slows down with age [3].\nTo prevent significant aging during the experiment, we focus on a time window of duration\nTexp = 20000 sec starting at tw = 280 000 sec, where tw = 0 is the time when the gel is formed.\nThe gel dynamics is measured by using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera-based light\nscattering apparatus similar to that described in [19], slightly modified to access larger q\nvectors. The dynamics is measured simultaneously at several q's (0.4 \u03bcm\u22121 \u2264 q \u2264 5.5 \u03bcm\u22121 ),\ncorresponding to length scales intermediate between the particle and the cluster size. In\norder to access both the average dynamics and its temporal fluctuations, we use the timeresolved correlation scheme [12, 20]. The degree of correlation between pairs of images of\nthe speckle\u0010pattern scattered at time\n\u0011 tw and tw + \u03c4 is calculated according to cI (tw , \u03c4, q) =\n\nG2 (tw , \u03c4 )/ hIp (tw )ip hIp (tw + \u03c4 )ip \u2212 1, where G2 (tw , \u03c4 ) = hIp (tw )Ip (tw + \u03c4 )ip and Ip (t) is\nthe scattered intensity at pixel p and time t. h* * *ip is an average over pixels corresponding to\nthe same magnitude of q but different azimuthal orientations. The intensity autocorrelation\nfunction is g2 (q, \u03c4 ) \u2212 1 = cI (tw , \u03c4, q), where * * * indicates a time average over Texp . Dynamical\nfluctuations are quantified by the temporal variance of cI at fixed \u03c4 and q [12,20], as discussed\nin more detail in the following.\nThe average dynamics is shown in Fig. 1a) for several q's. At all scattering vectors,\ng2 (q, \u03c4 )\u2212 1 exhibits an initial decay, followed by a slightly tilted plateau and a final relaxation.\nThe initial decay is barely observable due to the limited frame rate of the CCD camera; it is\n\n\fDuri et al.: Dynamical heterogeneity in a gel\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n10\nq\n\n2\n\n20 30\n-2\n\n( m )\n\na)\n\n0.0\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n(sec)\n\n4\n\n1.5\n\nf\n\n0.4\n\n2.0\n\n10\n\np\n\n(sec)\n\na\n\n) - 1\n\n0.6\n\ng(\n\n3\n\n10\n\n5\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\nb)\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\nq (\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nm )\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 a): g2 (q, \u03c4 )\u22121 for a gel at \u03c6 = 6\u00d710\u22124 .

Inset: semilogarithmic plot\nof the plateau height a vs. q 2 . The line is an exponential fit. b): q dependence of the relaxation time\n\u03c4f (open circles, left axis) and of the compressing exponent p (right axis, solid squares: this work;\nsemiopen squares: ref. [3]). The line is a power law fit to \u03c4f yielding an exponent \u22120.94 \u00b1 0.03.\n\ndue to overdamped, thermally activated fluctuations of the gel strands [21]. The height a of the\nplateau is related to the average amplitude, \u03b4p , of these fluctuations by a \u223c exp(\u2212q 2 \u03b4p2 /3) [21].\nBy fitting a(q) to this Gaussian form, we find \u03b4p = 500 \u00b1 150 nm (inset of Fig. 1a). The final\nrelaxation is well fitted by a compressed exponential decay: g2 (q, \u03c4 ) \u2212 1 = a exp[\u2212(\u03c4 /\u03c4f )p ],\nwhere a, \u03c4f , and p depend on q. Figure 1b) shows the q dependence of p (solid and semiopen\nsymbols) and \u03c4f (open circles). We find \u03c4f \u223c q \u22120.94\u00b10.03 , consistently with previous measurements at lower q [3]. This behavior rules out diffusive motion and indicates that, on average,\nthe particle displacement increases linearly with time. The compressing exponent p is approximately 1.5 at the smallest q probed in this work, in agreement with ref. [3] (semiopen squares)\nand in analogy with refs [4, 5, 7, 8, 10]. Surprisingly, however, at larger scattering vectors p\ndecreases with q, finally approaching p = 1. A similar trend has been reported very recently\nfor other systems with analogous dynamics [9, 10], although its origin remained unclear. We\nstress that this behavior is incompatible with the arguments proposed in refs. [3, 5], which\npredict p = 1.5 regardless of q. The model by Bouchaud and Pitard predicts p = 1.5 for q \u2192 0\nand p = 1.25 for q \u2192 \u221e [11]. However, in the intermediate q regime g2 \u2212 1 should deviate\nfrom a compressed exponential, contrary to our observations.\nTo better understand the origin of the gel dynamics, we investigate time-resolved quantities. Figure 2a) shows the time dependence of the instantaneous degree of correlation cI for\nq = 2.07 \u03bcm\u22121 and for several time lags \u03c4 (similar results are obtained for all q's). The top\ncurve shows data for \u03c4 = 250 sec, a time lag much smaller than the relaxation time \u03c4f = 3220\nsec; the data are correct for the contribution of measurement noise as described in Sec. IV\nc of ref. [20]. Sharp drops of cI departing from a high plateau are visible, indicating sudden\nchanges in the speckle pattern caused by discrete rearrangement events in the gel. The typical\nwidth of the downward spikes correspond essentially to \u03c4 , indicating that the rearrangements\nare shorter than the temporal resolution of the experiment (10 sec) [22]. We locate the time of\nthe events by analyzing the drops of cI for \u03c4 = 250 sec and by verifying that similar drops are\nobserved at the same time for all q's. The vertical bars in Fig. 2a) indicate the occurrence of\nthe rearrangements thus identified. We count 23 events during the time Texp = 20000 sec, implying that the average time between events is \u2206t = Texp/23 = 870 sec. For \u03c4 = 3000 sec \u2248 \u03c4f ,\nmuch larger fluctuations of cI are observed, because the number of events occurring between\ntwo speckles images separated by 3000 sec may significantly vary, due to the random nature\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n0.5\n\n10\n\n-1\n\na)\n\n-2\n\nI\n\nc (t\n\nw\n\n10\n\n( )\n\n)\n\nb)\n\n0.0\n\n5\n\n2.8x10\n\n2.9x10\n\nt\n\nw\n\n5\n\n(sec)\n\n3.0x10\n\n5\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n(sec)\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 a): temporal fluctuations of the instantaneous degree of correlation cI for q = 2.07 \u03bcm\u22121 .\nFrom top to bottom, \u03c4 = 250, 3000, 8000, and 20000 sec.

From bottom to top, q = 0.74, 1.24, 2.07, 3.78, and 5.22 \u03bcm\u22121 (same symbols as in\nFig. 1a). For the sake of clarity, not all the available curves have been plotted.\n\nof the events. This has to be contrasted with the case \u03c4 = 250 sec << \u2206t, where at most one\nevent occurs between two images, yielding the discrete drops discussed above. For \u03c4 >> \u2206t\n(two bottom curves in Fig. 2a), the fluctuations are again reduced, because on this time scale\nmany events occur and hence their (relative) number fluctuations are smaller, by virtue of the\nCentral Limit theorem.\nWe quantify the fluctuations of the dynamics resulting from the intermittent rearrangements by calculating \u03c7(\u03c4, q), the variance of cI corrected for the measurement noise contribution [20]. As discussed in [20], this quantity is the analogous in light scattering experiments\nof the dynamical susceptibility \u03c74 much studied in theoretical and numerical works on glass\nformers and gels [15\u201317, 24]. In order to compare data taken at different q vectors, we focus\non the relative fluctuations by normalizinghthe variance of cI with respect\nto the amplitude of\ni\n2\n\u22122\n2\nthe final decay of g2 \u2212 1: \u03c7(\u03c4, q) = a(q)\ncI (tw , \u03c4, q) \u2212 cI (tw , \u03c4, q) . Results for some representative q vectors are shown in Fig. 2b): for all q, \u03c7 has a peaked shape, the peak position\ncorresponding approximately to the decay time of the average correlation function, where the\nfluctuations of cI are largest as observed in Fig. 2a). This peaked shape is analogous to that\nreported in previous simulations and experiments on other glassy systems [16, 20, 23\u201325]. In\nthese systems, fluctuations usually arise from spatial correlations of the dynamics that reduce\nthe number of statistically independent regions in the system. By contrast, for the gels \u03c7 is\ndictated by the temporal intermittency of the rearrangement events, since they affect simultaneously the whole scattering volume, as found by directly measuring the spatial correlation\nof the slow dynamics [26]. The length scale dependence of the fluctuations, quantified by\nthe height of the peak, \u03c7\u2217 (q), has a very surprising behavior. As shown in Fig. 3b), we find\nthat \u03c7\u2217 increases strongly with q (\u03c7\u2217 \u223c q 1.13\u00b10.11 ). To our knowledge, no other experimental\ndata on 3D systems are available; however we point out that the gel behavior is in contrast\nwith measurements on a 2D granular system, where the peak of \u03c74 showed virtually no q\ndependence [25].\nThe intermittent dynamics shown here is in stark contrast with the continuous ballistic\nmotion assumed in [3,5,11]. In the following, we develop a simple yet general model of dynamic\nlight scattering from an intermittent dynamical process, aiming at rationalizing both the\n\n\fDuri et al.: Dynamical heterogeneity in a gel\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n2.0\n\na)\n\n1\n\nb)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nf\n\np\n\n1.5\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nq\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nq\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 a): q dependence of the relaxation time (top line, left axis) and of the compressing exponent\n(bottom line, right axis) in reduced variables, as obtained from the model described in the text.\nThe symbols are the experimental data shown in Fig. 1b): a very good agreement with the model is\nobtained for \u03b4 = 250 nm and \u03b3 \u22121 = 960 sec. b) peak of the dynamical susceptibility \u03c7\u2217 vs q\u03b4 for\nthe model (line) and the experiments (symbols). The dashed line is a power law fit with an exponent\n1.13 \u00b1 0.11\n\naverage correlation function and its fluctuations. We assume the slow dynamics to be due to a\nseries of discrete rearrangement events, which we take \u2013for simplicity\u2013 to have equal amplitude\nand to be instantaneous. The degree of correlation is then a function h, to be determined, of\nq and the number m of events occurring between tw and tw + \u03c4 : cI (tw , \u03c4, q) = h[m(tw , \u03c4 ), q].\nWithin this scenario, the fluctuations of cI are due to fluctuations of the number of events\nactually occurring during any given interval [tw , tw + \u03c4 ]. We calculate the average dynamics\nand its fluctuations according to\ng2 (\u03c4, q) \u2212 1 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP\u03c4 (n)h(n, q)\n\n(1)\n\nn=0\n\n\u03c7(\u03c4, q) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP\u03c4 (n)[h(n, q) \u2212 (g2 (\u03c4, q) \u2212 1)]2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere P\u03c4 (n) is the probability that n events affect the scattering volume during a time span\n\u03c4 . In writing Eq. (2), we have taken into account that the dynamics is spatially correlated\nover a length scale much larger than the size of the scattering volume, so that fluctuations are\nnot reduced by averaging the collected signal over several dynamically independent regions.\nIn order to calculate g2 and \u03c7 from Eqs. (1,2), we need expressions for P\u03c4 and h. For the\nformer, we choose for simplicity a Poisson law: P\u03c4 (n) = exp(\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 )(\u03b3\u03c4 )n /n!, corresponding to\nrearrangement events that are random in time and affect the scattering volume at an average\nrate \u03b3. For the latter, we write h(n, q) in terms of the displacement field generated by n\nrearrangement events. By introducing \u2206R, the particle displacement due to one single event,\none has h(n, q) =< exp(\u2212in\u03b1 q * \u2206R) > [27], where the average is taken over all possible\norientations of q and over all particles. The exponent \u03b1 is expected to be \u2264 1: \u03b1 = 0.5 would\ncorrespond to diffusive-like dynamics where the displacement grows as the square root of the\nnumber of events, while \u03b1 = 1 would lead, on average, to a ballistic-like motion. For the\ngels, we expect \u03b1 = 1, because for the average dynamics\nq \u221d \u03c4f\u22121 . The correlation left after\nR\nn events is then h(n, q) =< exp(\u2212inq * \u2206R) >= P DF (\u2206R) exp(inq * \u2206R)d\u2206R , where\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nP DF (\u2206R) is the probability distribution function (PDF) of the particle displacements [27].\nBy assuming that the displacement field induced by one single event is that due to the long\nrange elastic deformation of the gel under the action of dipolar stresses [5, 11] and using\narguments similar to those developed in ref. [5], one has h(n, q) = exp[\u2212(qn\u03b4)\u03b2 ]. Here \u03b4 is\nthe typical displacement of the particles due to one single event and \u03b2 = 1.5 corresponds to\na PDF with a \u2206R\u22122.5 power law right tail, as predicted for dipolar stress sources randomly\nscattered in space [5, 11].\nWe insert the above expressions for P\u03c4 and h in Eqs. (1,2), using \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1.5, and\ncalculate both the average dynamics and its fluctuations. The resulting g2 (\u03c4, q) \u2212 1 is very\nwell approximated by a compressed exponential decay, in agreement with the experimental\ndata. We show in Fig. 3a) the compressing exponent p and the dimensionless relaxation time\n\u03b3\u03c4f issued from the fit of the model, as a function of the dimensionless scattering vector q\u03b4\n(lines). For q\u03b4 \u2192 0, we find p \u2192 \u03b2 = 1.5. At larger scattering vectors, p decreases approaching\none. In all the q regime where p > 1, \u03b3\u03c4f \u221d q \u22121 , a consequence of the choice \u03b1 = 1 that yields,\non average, ballistic-like dynamics. Note that the fact that the displacement due to successive\nevents adds up coherently (\u03b1 = 1) suggests that they originate from the same source, i.e. that\nstress sources are very diluted and their life time exceeds the relaxation time of g2 . Thus,\nseveral discrete events are necessary to fully relax a stress source. For q\u03b4 >> 1, where p\nsaturates to one, we find \u03c4f = \u03b3 \u22121 independently of q. Indeed, when the typical displacement\n\u03b4 is much larger than the length scale 1/q probed by light scattering, one single event is\nsufficient to lead to a complete decorrelation of the scattered light. The only relevant time\nscale is then \u03b3 \u22121 , the average time between events. In this regime h(n, q) \u2248 0 for n > 0: the\nonly non vanishing term in the average correlation function, r.h.s. of Eq. (1), corresponds to\nn = 0 and g2 (q, \u03c4 ) \u2212 1 = exp(\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 ).\nFigure 3a) shows also the experimentally determined p and \u03c4f plotted using dimensionless\nvariables, with \u03b4 = 250 nm and \u03b3 = 1.04 \u00d7 10\u22123 Hz. With this choice of the parameters, a\nvery good agreement between the model and the experiments is found. Remarkably, \u03b4 is of the\nsame order of magnitude of the amplitude of the fluctuations of the gel strands due to thermal\nmotion (\u03b4p = 500 nm). This strongly supports the intuitive picture that the rearrangement\nevents correspond to the formation of new bonds and/or the breaking of the bonds along the\ngel network. Since both processes are ultimately triggered by thermal energy, they would\ntypically cause particle displacements comparable to those due to the thermal fluctuations\nof the gel. The average ballistic dynamics is thus the result of a slow compaction of the gel\nthat proceeds by discrete rearrangements, rather than of a continuous process. The event rate\n\u03b3 determined by fitting the model to the experimental average dynamics corresponds to an\naverage time between events of 960 sec, in excellent agreement with \u2206t = 870 sec obtained\ndirectly from the drops of cI shown in Fig. 2a). A further test of the model would be the\nobservation of the high q limit where g2 \u2212 1 \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 ). However, for our gels this regime\nis not experimentally accessible, since as q grows the amplitude a of the slow mode of g2 \u2212 1\ndecreases as exp(\u2212q 2 \u03b4p2 /3) (see Fig. 1a), ultimately vanishing for q\u03b4p > q\u03b4 >> 1.\nHaving fixed the parameters of the model by comparison with the experimental average\ndynamics, we compare the theoretical predictions for the dynamical susceptibility to the experiments. We find that \u03c7 has the same peaked shape as for the experiments; the q dependence of\nthe height of the peak is shown in Fig. 3b) (line) together with the experimental points (filled\ncircles). The model captures correctly the nearly linear growth of \u03c7\u2217 with q and the order of\nmagnitude of the dynamical fluctuations, although it overestimates them by about a factor\nof two. Given the simplicity of the assumptions and the fact that no adjustable parameter\nhas been introduced specifically for \u03c7, this agreement is quite remarkable, showing that the\nmodel captures the essential physics of the slow dynamics of the gel. Interestingly, the \u03c7\u2217 \u223c q\n\n\fDuri et al.: Dynamical heterogeneity in a gel\n\n7\n\ngrowth at low q and the saturation regime at large q are similar to asymptotic predictions\nfor \u03c74 (\u03c4, q) in glass formers proposed very recently by Chandler et al. Indeed, in ref. [28] a\nsaturation regime at large q and a \u03c74 \u223c q 2 scaling for q \u2192 0 are identified, the q 2 rather that\nq dependence being the consequence of diffusive rather than ballistic-like dynamics.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the slow dynamics of colloidal gels is a highly discontinuous process, due to intermittent, sudden rearrangement events. We have proposed a simple\nmodel of intermittent dynamics that captures correctly the q dependence of both the average\ndynamics and dynamical fluctuations. Although some aspects of our model and their physical interpretation are certainly specific to the dilute colloidal gels studied here, its general\nfeatures may be relevant also to other soft systems. In particular, more time-resolved experiments will be needed to test whether the underlying picture of intermittent rearrangements\nmay apply also to the numerous soft systems whose average dynamics is similar to that of\nthe gels. This would challenge the currently accepted interpretation in terms of a continuous\nballistic process [4\u201310].\nWe thank V. Trappe, P. Chaikin, D. Pine, J. P. Bouchaud and L.
