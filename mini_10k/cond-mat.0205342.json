Different approximate\nschemes, in fact, often need different quantities from jellium. As an example, density functional theory (DFT)\nuses the exchange-correlation energy of the uniform electron gas for the widely used local density approximation\n(LDA). For building nonempirical beyond-LDA functionals for use in DFT, the pair density of jellium is often\nneeded.9\nIn such applications, the quantities from the uniform\nelectron gas must be available in the form of analytic\nexpressions. Since the jellium model is not exactly solvable, analytic expressions are built by interpolating between known exact limits, and by fitting the Quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) data, when available. Relevant examples are (i) the correlation energy used in LDA implementation, built by using functional forms10,11,12 which\nincludes exact limits and interpolate the QMC data of\nCeperley and Alder;13 (ii) the pair density, built by com-\n\nbining exact properties and fitting to QMC data,14,15\nor by simply interpolating between exact limits;16 (iii)\nthe static local field factor, parametrized by fitting17\nQMC data of the static response;18 (iv) the dynamical local field factors, built by using many known exact\nconstraints.19 All these parametrized quantities are not\nstrictly \"exact\", but are considered to be the closest to\nthe true quantities, in the sense that this is the best one\ncan presently obtain, and in the sense that they are accurate enough for the purpose for which they are needed.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in\na particular approach to the many-electron problem of\nnonuniform density, the so called density matrix functional theory (DMFT), which uses the one-body density\nmatrix as basic variable.6,20,21,22 Building a \"local approximation\" for DMFT is not an easy task: in a first\nattempt,23 the momentum distribution n(k, rs ) of jellium\nhas been used as input. Besides this important application, for which a reliable parametrization of n(k, rs )\nis needed, there are other reasons to focus on the momentum distribution of jellium. The definitions of \"exchange\" and \"correlation\" in DMFT are different from\nthose in DFT and in Hartree-Fock-like approaches: in\nDMFT the cumulant part7,8 of the pair density rises\nto be a key quantity. An accurate parametrization of\nn(k, rs ) at metallic densities allows to extract the cumulant pair density of jellium, since the whole pair density\nis available.14,15,16 The cumulant pair density can then\nbe compared with recent attempts to calculate it in a\nhigh-density electron gas,24,25 and can be diagonalized\nin terms of \"cumulant geminals\" (analog of \"Overhauser\ngeminals\" for the pair density26,27,28 ). Also, the study\nof exact limiting behaviors of the cumulant pair density\nis of great interest, since some of these limits could be\n\n\f2\napproximately valid in nonuniform systems.\nThe momentum distribution of the uniform electron\ngas is also useful for the calculation of the exchangecorrelation correction to Compton profiles computed\nwithin LDA-DFT.29 Note also that n(k, rs ) determines\nthe part of the local-field factor beyond the randomphase approximation (RPA) which takes into account the\nchange in occupation numbers in the Lindhard function\n[see Eq. (29) of Ref. 19].\nThe qualitative behavior of n(k, rs ) is the following. It\nstarts at k = 0 with a value n(0, rs ) . 1 and decreases\nwith increasing k. For k < 1 it is concave. Then in\nthe Fermi-liquid regime at k = 1 there is a finite jump\n(Fermi gap) from n(1\u2212 , rs ) to a lower value n(1+ , rs ) =\nn(1\u2212 , rs ) \u2212 zF (rs ) with logarithmic slopes at both sides\nof k = 1. For k > 1 (correlation tail) n(k, rs ) is convex,\nand vanishes for k \u2192 \u221e. For rs = 0 (ideal Fermi gas)\nit is n(k, 0) = \u03b8(1 \u2212 k), where \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step\nfunction. Thus, the quasiparticle weight zF (rs ) starts\nwith zF (0) = 1 and decreases with increasing interaction\nstrength rs . At large rs the electrons form a Wigner\ncrystal with a smooth n(k, rs ). rs \u226a 1 and rs \u226b 1\nare the weak- and strong-correlation limits, respectively.\nFor intermediate values of rs a non-Fermi liquid regime\nmay exist with zF = 0. In such case n(k, rs ) would be\ncontinuous vs. k, with a nonanalytical behavior at k = 1.\nIn Ref. 30, the idea of using the convex Kulik function G(x) to parametrize the two branches (k < 1 and\nk > 1) of n(k, rs ) is sketched. The function G(x) appeared in Kulik's31 RPA analysis of n(k, rs ) near the\nFermi edge (|1 \u2212 k| << 1), see Eq. (A4). G(x) behaves as c0 + c1 x ln x for small x (see Appendix A and\nFig. 1), which corresponds to the correct nonanalytic behavior of n(k, rs ) near the Fermi surface. So, supposing that the value at the centre, n(0, rs ), and the values\nat the Fermi edge, n(1\u2212 , rs ) and n(1+ , rs ), are known,\nit should be possible to represent n(k, rs ) in terms of\nG(x), with suitable prefactors and with suitable scaling\n(squeezing and stretching) of its argument. In this way,\nn(k, rs ) becomes a functional of n0 (rs ) = n(0, rs ), and\nof n\u00b1 (rs ) = n(1\u00b1 , rs ), and can be designed to yield the\nproper normalization and the correct kinetic energy t(rs ),\nwhich follows from the total energy \u01eb(rs ) = t(rs ) + v(rs )\nvia the virial theorem.32 In Ref. 30, the input data from\nTakada and Yasuhara (TY)33,34 for n0 (rs ), n\u00b1 (rs ) and\nt(rs ) at rs = 1, ..., 5 have been used, together with the\non-top pair density g0 (rs ) = g(0, rs ) [which determines\nthe large-k behavior of n(k)] from Ref. 27. The result is\na field n(k, rs ) for rs \u2208 [1, 6] which is correctly concave\nfor k < 1, convex for k > 1, and with a Fermi gap zF (rs )\nat k = 1 decreasing with growing rs . The attempt to\nextend this procedure for rs \u2208 [6, 10] failed: n(k < 1, rs )\nis no longer concave for rs & 6.\nHere, an improved version of the parametrization of\nn(k, rs ) in terms of the Kulik function G(x) is presented.\nOur parametrized momentum distribution is in good\nagreement with the TY values,33,34 and is valid in the\nrange of densities rs . 12. Previous parametrizations of\n\nn(k, rs )35,36,37,38 used the Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\ndata of Ref. 35 as an input. However, QMC data are\npresently only available for 0.4 . k . 0.9 and 1.1 . k .\n1.5, thus not providing information about n(k, rs ) near\nthe centre, k = 0, and at the Fermi edge, k = 1. In\nthese last regions, in fact, different parametrizations of\nthe same QMC data can be rather different from each\nother.35,36,37 Our construction of n(k, rs ) uses information from the effective-potential calculations of Takada\nand Yasuhara,33,34 from the high- and low-density limits\nof n(k, rs ), corresponding to RPA and the Wigner crystal (WC) limit, and from accurate parametrizations of\nt(rs )12 and of g0 (rs ).27 In the regions where QMC data\nare available, our n(k, rs ) is compatible with them. Also,\nwith respect to previous works,35,36,37,38 the functional\nform used here satisfies more exact limits. In particular, the logarithmic behavior at the Fermi edge is taken\ninto account for the first time.39 Notice that it causes the\nlogarithmic divergence of t(rs \u2192 0).40\nUsing our n(k, rs ), the moments hk \u03bd i, the correlation entropy, and the one-body reduced density matrix\nf (x, rs ) are evaluated. The latter appears in the cumulant partitioning of the pair density g(x, rs ). The static\nstructure factor S(k, rs ), related to the pair density via\nFourier transform, the particle-number fluctuations in\nfragments \u2206N\u03a9 (rs ), and the potential energy v(rs ) are\ndiscussed in terms of their cumulant partitioning, and\nsome exact limits are derived. Finally, by means of an\naccurate model for the spin-resolved pair density,15 the\ncumulant part of g(x, rs ) is extracted.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the known\nsum rules and limiting cases for n(k, rs ) are reported, and\nthey are used in Sec. III to build up our parametrization of the momentum distribution via the Kulik function. Sec. IV is devoted to the calculation and discussion\nof different measures of the correlation strength, of the\none-matrix, and of the cumulant expansion of the pairdensity. In Sec. V, we study the cumulant partitioning\nof the static structure factor, of the density fluctuations\nand of the potential energy. Conclusions and future developments are reported in the last Sec.

At metallic and lower densities,\nother techniques must be used, namely, the effectivepotential method,33 which combines perturbation theory (Green's functions) with the Fermi-hypernetted\nchain approach, and the QMC simulations.35,43 A more\ncomplete list of references concerning calculations and\nparametrizations can be found in Ref. 30.\nn(k, rs ) has to satisfy the condition 0 < n(k, rs ) <\n1 (which guarantees the ensemble N -representability of\nthe 1-matrix), and the sum rules (k in units of kF , and\nenergies in ryd)\n\n1\n(\u03b1rs )2\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndk 3 n(k, rs ) = 1,\n\n(3)\n\ndk 3 n(k, rs ) k 2 = t(rs ),\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nwhere t(rs ) can be written as the sum of the kinetic energy of the free Fermi gas, 3/5 (\u03b1rs )\u22122 , and of the kinetic\nenergy of correlation, tcorr (rs ). For rs \u226a 1, tcorr (rs ) is\nknown from RPA and from the lowest-order exchange\ndiagram beyond it;44,45,46 for a summary see Eq. (3.25)\nand Figs. 1a and 1b of Ref. 24. At larger rs , tcorr (rs ) can\nbe obtained via the virial theorem32 from parametrized\nQMC correlation energies.12\nThe large-k behavior of n(k, rs ) is determined by the\nkinks in the many-body wave-function which occur whenever two electrons are at contact or \"on-top\" (coalescing\n\n(5)\n\nwhere g0 (rs ) = g(0, rs ) is the on-top value of the pairdistribution function. In the rs \u2192 0 limit, g0 (rs ) can be\nobtained from perturbation theory,49,50 and at larger rs\nit has been calculated by solving an effective two-body\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation.27,51\nIn a normal Fermi liquid,52 the momentum distribution has a discontinuity and infinite slopes53 at the Fermi\nedge, k = 1,\nn(k \u2192 1\u2212 , rs ) = n\u2212 (rs ) \u2212 A(rs )(1 \u2212 k) ln(1 \u2212 k) +\nO(1 \u2212 k),\n(6)\n+\nn(k \u2192 1 , rs ) = n+ (rs ) + A(rs )(k \u2212 1) ln(k \u2212 1) +\nO(k \u2212 1).\n(7)\nIn the following, A(rs ) is referred to as the Fermi edge\ncoefficient. In the small-rs limit, n\u00b1 (rs ) and A(rs ) are\nknown from RPA (see Appendix A). In the low-density\nor WC limit, the Fermi gap disappers [n\u2212 (rs ) \u2192 n+ (rs )],\nthe infinite slopes at the Fermi edge may also vanish\n[A(rs ) \u2192 0].\nNear the centre, k \u2192 0, n(k, rs ) should behave\nquadratically,36,37,38,43\nn(k \u2192 0, rs ) = n0 (rs ) + B(rs )k 2 + O(k 4 ).\n\n(8)\n\nA simple argument in favour of Eq. (8) is that it holds\nboth in the high- and in the low-density limit (see Appendix A and B).\nWhen rs \u2192 0, exact results for n(k, rs ) are known by\nmeans of RPA31,42 (Appendix A). In the RPA treatment,\nthe Kulik function G(x) appears,31 see Eqs. (A3)-(A5)\nand Fig. 1. G(x) will be used in the next section to build\nup a parametrized n(k, rs ) which satifies Eqs. (3)-(8).\nIn the low-density or strongly correlated limit, rs \u2192\n\u221e, the electron gas undergoes Wigner crystallization\n(see, e.g., Refs. 54,56). A simple model for the momentum distribution in such regime is reported in Appendix B.\nIII.\n\nIMPROVED PARAMETRIZATION OF\nn(k, rs )\n\nThe momentum distribution in terms of the Kulik\nfunction G(x) of Fig. 1 is parametrized as follows.

(3) and (4) (with tcorr (rs )\nfrom Ref. 12). The values n0 (rs ) and n\u00b1 (rs ) were taken\nfrom the TY data (available for rs = 1, ..., 5). The on-top\nvalue g0 (rs ) was taken from Ref. 27.\nIn our improved ansatz of Eqs. (9)-(12), we set\na< (rs ) = a> (rs ) = a(rs ) (in agreement with Ref. 53;\nalso Figs. 7 and 8 of Ref. 30 confirm this), and we use\nagain tcorr (rs ) from Ref. 12 and g0 (rs ) from Ref. 27.\nSince we want to extend our results in the density range\n6 \u2264 rs \u2264 10, where there are no data available for n0 (rs )\nand n\u00b1 (rs ), we extract information from the extreme\nlow-density limit (Wigner crystal - see Appendix B), by\nfollowing an oversimplified version of the idea presented\nin Ref. 55.\nWe first build n0 (rs ) by using a functional form which\nrecovers the exact high-density limit, includes the Wigner\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 2: Parametrized n(0, rs ) (solid line), compared to the\nTakada-Yasuhara (TY) values.33,34 The high-density or RPA\nlimit and the Wigner crystal (WC) limit are also shown.\n0\n-0.2\nB(rs)\n\nHere F \u2032\u2032 (0) = 17.968746 [see Appendix A, Eq.

The\nbehavior of the Kulik function for small and large arguments (see Appendix A) ensures the exact asymptotic\nexpansion of Eqs.

The entropy of this probability 'distribution' is just the integrand of Eq. (22), and\nsph (rs ) is the sum of all these entropies. Notice its invariance under the exchange n(k, rs ) \u2194 1 \u2212 n(k, rs ), which\nis referred to as particle-hole symmetry in the ReducedDensity-Matrix community. This symmetry is an intrinsic property of the correlation energy as a functional of\nthe 1-matrix.61 sph (rs ) is plotted in Fig. 8. Another measure of the correlation strength is the correlation-tail normalization\nZ \u221e\nncorrtail (rs ) =\ndk 3 n(k, rs ),\n(23)\n1\n\nalso reported in Fig. 8. For large rs , the Fermi edge\ndisappears, zF (rs ) = 0, and also any relict of it, A(rs ) =\n0, then the inflexion point of n(k, rs ) vs. k may serve in\nEq.

The rs -functions\nn(0, rs ), n(1\u00b1 , rs ), the on-top pair density g(0, rs ), and\nthe kinetic energy t(rs ) form the input for such construction. In this work, we improved the parametrization of\nn(k, rs ) via the Kulik function, and we extended it up to\nrs . 12, including the high-density regime [Eqs. (9)\u2013(12),\nand Fig. 6].\nThe Fourier transform of n(k, rs ) yields the one-body\nreduced density matrix f (x, rs ) (Figs. 9 and 10), with\nlarge x-oscillations arising from the Fermi gap zF (rs )\nand the Fermi edge coefficient A(rs ), the prefactor of\nthe logarithmic term in n(k \u2248 1, rs ), which is included\nin our parametrization for the first time (Fig. 5). Several measures of the correlation strength have been discussed (Fig. 8). With reliable models for the pair density, g(x, rs ), the cumulant pair density h(x, rs ) = 1 \u2212\n1\n2\n2 |f (x, rs )| \u2212 g(x, rs ) has been extracted (Fig. 11), as a\nprestep of its diagonalization in terms of cumulant geminals (analog with the diagonalization of the pair density\nin terms of Overhauser geminals). Future work also includes the generalization to the partially polarized gas.\nIn this case, with \u03b6 = (N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 )/N , one has to consider different cases. For spin polarization \u03b6 between 0\nand 1, two momentum distributions are to be described,\nn\u2191 (k, rs , \u03b6) for the spin-up electrons and n\u2193 (k, rs , \u03b6) for\nthe spin-down electrons. So far, only the input data\ng0 (rs , \u03b6)27 and t(rs , \u03b6)12 are available in this more general\ncase.\nA small FORTRAN subroutine, which numerically\nevaluates our parametrized n(k, rs ), is available at\nhttp://axtnt2.phys.uniroma1.it/PGG/elegas.html.\n\n\f10\nwork.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Y.
