Introduction\nWe present our recent determination [1] of the light quark masses (strange quark mass ms and\naverage up-down quark mass mud ), of the kaon pseudoscalar decay constant fK , and of the ratio\nfK / f\u03c0 . In order to investigate the properties of the K meson, we have simulated the theory with\nN f = 2 degenerate dynamical and two valence quarks, considering a partially quenched setup with\nthe valence quark masses \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 different between each other and from the sea quark mass \u03bcS .\nThe calculation is based on a set of (ETMC) gauge field configurations generated with the treelevel improved Symanzik gauge action at \u03b2 = 3.9, corresponding to a = 0.087(1) fm (a\u22121 \u2243 2.3\nGeV) [2], and the twisted mass fermionic action at maximal twist. We have simulated 5 values of the bare sea quark mass, a\u03bcS = {0.0040, 0.0064, 0.0085, 0.0100, 0.0150} and 8 values,\na\u03bc1,2 = {0.0040, 0.0064, 0.0085, 0.0100, 0.0150, 0.0220, 0.0270, 0.0320}, for the valence quark\nmass. The first five masses, equal to the sea masses, lie in the range 1/6 ms <\n\u223c 2/3 ms , being\n\u223c \u03bc1,2 <\nms the physical strange quark mass, while the heaviest three are around the strange quark mass.\nAt each value of the sea quark mass we have computed the two-point correlation functions of\ncharged pseudoscalar mesons, on a set of 240 independent gauge field configurations, separated by\n20 HMC trajectories one from the other. To improve the statistical accuracy, we have evaluated the\nmeson correlators using a stochastic method with a Z(2)-noise to include all spatial sources [3, 4].\nStatistical errors on meson masses and decay constants are evaluated using the jackknife procedure,\nwhile those on the fit results, based on data obtained at different sea quark masses, are evaluated\nusing a bootstrap procedure. Further details on the numerical simulation can be found in refs. [1, 5].\nThe use of twisted mass fermions presents several advantages [6]: i) the pseudoscalar meson\nmasses and decay constants are automatically improved at O(a); ii) at maximal twist, the physical\nquark mass is directly related to the twisted mass parameter of the action, and it is subject only to\nmultiplicative renormalization; iii) the determination of the pseudoscalar decay constant does not\nrequire the introduction of any renormalization constant, and it is based on the relation\nfPS = (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 )\n\n|h0|P1 (0)|Pi|\n.\n2\nMPS\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe meson mass MPS and the matrix element |h0|P1 (0)|Pi| have been extracted from a fit of the\ntwo-point pseudoscalar correlation function in the time interval t/a \u2208 [10, 21]. In order to illustrate\nthe quality of the data, we show in fig. 1 the effective masses of pseudoscalar mesons, as a function\nof the time, in the degenerate cases \u03bcS = \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 .\n2\n\n\fLight quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants from N f = 2 tmQCD\n\nCecilia Tarantino\n\n2. Quark mass dependence of pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants\nThe determination of the physical properties of K mesons requires to study the corresponding\nobservables over a large range of masses, from the physical strange quark down to the light updown quark. In ref. [1], we have studied the quark mass dependence of pseudoscalar meson masses\nand decay constants by considering two different functional forms: i) the dependence predicted by\ncontinuum partially quenched chiral perturbation theory (PQChPT), ii) a polynomial dependence.\nPQChPT fits: Within PQChPT we have considered the full next-to-leading order (NLO) expressions with the addition of the local NNLO contributions, i.e. terms quadratic in the quark\nmasses, which turn out to be needed for a good description of the data up to the region of the\nstrange quark. The PQChPT predictions [7] can be written as\n\u0014\n\u03be1 (\u03beS \u2212 \u03be1 ) ln 2\u03be1 \u03be2 (\u03beS \u2212 \u03be2 ) ln 2\u03be2\n2\nMPS (\u03bcS , \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) = B0 (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 ) * 1 +\n\u2212\n+\n(\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 )\n(\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 )\n\u0003\n2\n2\n+aV \u03be12 + aS \u03beS + aVV \u03be12\n+ aSS \u03beS2 + aV S \u03be12 \u03beS + aV D \u03beD12\n,\n(2.1)\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03be1 \u03be2 \u2212 \u03beS \u03be12\n\u03be1\nfPS (\u03bcS , \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) = f * 1 \u2212 \u03be1S ln 2\u03be1S \u2212 \u03be2S ln 2\u03be2S +\nln\n+\n2 (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 )\n\u03be2\n\u0003\n2\n2\n+ bSS \u03beS2 + bV S \u03be12 \u03beS + bV D \u03beD12\n,\n+(bV + 1/2) \u03be12 + (bS \u2212 1/2) \u03beS + bVV \u03be12\n\nwhere \u03bei = 2B0 \u03bci /(4\u03c0 f )2 , \u03bei j = B0 (\u03bci + \u03bc j )/(4\u03c0 f )2 and \u03beDi j = B0 (\u03bci \u2212 \u03bc j )/(4\u03c0 f )2 . The parameters B0 and f are the LO low energy constants (LECs) 1 , whereas aV , aS , bV and bS are related to\nthe NLO LECs by aV = 4\u03b18 \u2212 2\u03b15 , aS = 8\u03b16 \u2212 4\u03b14 , bV = \u03b15 , bS = 2\u03b14 . The quadratic mass terms\nin eq. (2.1) represent the local NNLO contributions. The chiral logarithms, also known at two loops\nin the partially quenched theory [8], involve a larger number of NLO LECs whose values cannot\nbe fixed from phenomenology in the N f = 2 theory. Introducing their contribution would increase\nsignificantly the number of free parameters, thus limiting the predictive power of the calculation.\nAiming at a percent precision, the impact of finite size corrections cannot be neglected in our\nstudy, where the lattice spatial extension is L = 24a \u2243 2.2 fm and MPS L \u2265 3.2. Since we have not\nperformed yet a systematic study on different lattice volumes, we have estimated the finite size\neffects by including in the fits the corrections predicted by one-loop PQChPT [9] (for their explicit\nexpressions see ref. [1]).\nPolynomial fits: The inclusion of the local NNLO contributions in the PQChPT predictions\nof eq. (2.1) is required by the observation that the pure NLO predictions are not accurate enough to\ndescribe the quark mass dependence of pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants up to the\nstrange quark region. Not having considered the full NNLO chiral predictions, we have evaluated\nthe associated systematic uncertainty, considering as an alternative description a simple polynomial\ndependence on the quark masses, for both pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2 (\u03bc , \u03bc , \u03bc ) = B ( \u03bc + \u03bc ) * 1 + a \u03be + a \u03be + a \u03be 2 + a \u03be 2 + a \u03be \u03be + a \u03be 2\nMPS\nS 1 2\n0\n1\n2\nV 12\nS S\nVV 12\nV D D12 ,\nSS S\nV S 12 S\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n2\n+ bSS \u03beS2 + bV S \u03be12 \u03beS + bV D \u03beD12\nfPS (\u03bcS , \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) = f * 1 + (bV + 1/2)\u03be12 + (bS \u2212 1/2)\u03beS + bVV \u03be12\n.\n(2.2)\n\nThe differences between the results obtained by performing either chiral or polynomial fits have\nbeen included in the final estimates of the systematic errors.\n1 The\n\npseudoscalar decay constant f is normalised such that f\u03c0 = 130.7 MeV at the physical pion mass.\n\n3\n\n\fLight quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants from N f = 2 tmQCD\n\nCecilia Tarantino\n\n3. Chiral extrapolations\nThe input data of our analysis [1] are the lattice results for the pseudoscalar meson masses and\ndecay constants obtained at each value of the sea quark mass, with both degenerate and non degenerate valence quarks. We have excluded from the fits the heaviest mesons having both the valence\nquark masses in the strange mass region, i.e. with a\u03bc1,2 = {0.0220, 0.0270, 0.0320}, considering\ntherefore 150 combinations of quark masses. The number of free parameters in the combined fit of\n2 and f\nMPS\nPS is 14, but a first analysis shows that some of them (from 1 to 5 depending on the fit)\nare compatible with zero within one standard deviation, and are kept fixed to zero.\nIn order to extrapolate the pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants to the points corresponding to the physical pion and kaon, we have considered three different fits:\n\u2022 Polynomial fit: a polynomial dependence on the quark masses is assumed for pseudoscalar\nmeson masses and decay constants, according to eq. (2.2).\n\u2022 PQChPT fit: pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants are fitted according to the\nPQChPT predictions of eq. (2.1) including the finite volume corrections derived in ref. [9].\n\u2022 Constrained PQChPT fit: this fit, denoted as C-PQChPT in the following, deserves a more\ndetailed explanation. The main uncertainty in using eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) to describe the\n2 and f\nquark mass dependence of MPS\nPS is related to the extrapolation toward the physical\nup-down quark mass. On the other hand, we have shown in ref. [2] that pure NLO ChPT,\nwith the inclusion of finite volume corrections, is sufficiently accurate in describing the lattice\npseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants when the analysis is restricted to our lightest\nfour quark masses in the unitary setup (i.e. \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = \u03bcS ). In order to take advantage of this\ninformation, when performing the C-PQChPT fit we first determine the LO parameters B0\nand f and the NLO combinations aV + aS and bV + bS from a fit based on pure NLO ChPT\nperformed on the lightest four unitary points. By using these constraints, the other parameters\n2 and f\nentering the chiral expansions of MPS\nPS are then obtained from a fit to eq. (2.1) over\nthe non unitary points. For consistency with the previous unitary fit, we exclude also in this\ncase from the analysis the data at the highest value of sea quark mass, a\u03bcS = 0.0150.\nWe find that, though the quality of the fit is better in the polynomial case, all three analyses provide\na good description of the lattice data, in the whole region of masses explored in the simulation,\nonce the terms quadratic in the quark masses are taken into account.\nA potential problem in the partially quenched theory is the divergence of the chiral logarithms\nin the limit in which the light valence quark mass goes to zero at fixed sea quark mass (see eq. (2.1)).\nThis divergence does not affect the extrapolation of the lattice results to the physical point, since\nsea and the light valence quark masses are degenerate in this case. However, in order to verify that\nthis unphysical behaviour of the partially quenched chiral logarithms does not modify the result\nof the extrapolation, we have repeated the analysis restricting both the polynomial and the chiral\nfits to the 30 quark mass combinations (26 in the case of the C-PQChPT fit) that, satisfying the\nconstraint \u03bc2 \u2265 \u03bc1 = \u03bcS , are not affected by dangerous chiral logarithms. The comparison between\nthe results obtained by considering the two different sets of quark masses is reassuring, as it shows\nthat the effects of potentially divergent chiral logarithms are well under control in our analysis.\nThe mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants is illustrated\nin fig. 2, where lattice data are compared with the results of the polynomial, PQChPT and C4\n\n\fLight quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants from N f = 2 tmQCD\n\n4,7\n\nCecilia Tarantino\n\n0,095\n\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0040\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0064\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0085\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0100\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0150\nPolynomial Fit\nPQChPT Fit\nC-PQChPT Fit\n\n2\n\n(aMPS)\n(a\u03bc1+a\u03bc2)/2\n\n4,6\n\n4,5\n\n0,090\n\nafPS\n\n0,085\n\n0,080\n\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0040\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0064\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0085\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0100\na\u03bcS=a\u03bc1=0.0150\nPolynomial Fit\nPQChPT Fit\nC-PQChPT Fit\n\n0,075\n\n0,070\n\n4,4\n\n0,065\n\n4,3\n0,000\n\n0,005\n\n0,010\n\n0,015\n\n0,020\n\n0,025\n\n0,030\n\n0,035\n\n0,060\n0,000\n\n0,040\n\n0,005\n\n0,010\n\n0,015\n\n0,020\n\n0,025\n\n0,030\n\n0,035\n\n0,040\n\na\u03bc2\na\u03bc2\n1\n2\n2\nFigure 2: Lattice results for a MPS / 2 (a\u03bc1 + a \u03bc2 ) (left) and a fPS (right) as a function of the valence quark\nmass a\u03bc2 , with a\u03bc1 = a\u03bcS . The solid, dashed and dotted curves represent the results of the three fits.\n\nPQChPT fits. We have shown in the plots the cases in which one of the valence quark mass (\u03bc1 )\nis equal to the sea quark mass, and the results are presented as a function of the second valence\nquark mass (\u03bc2 ). The points corresponding to the physical pion and kaon are thus obtained by\nextrapolating/interpolating the results shown in fig. 2 to the limits \u03bc1 \u2192 mud and \u03bc2 \u2192 ms .\nTo investigate the impact of finite volume corrections we have compared, for the pseudoscalar\nmeson masses and decay constants, the PQChPT fits obtained with or without including these\ncorrections. The differences turn out to be small [1]; however, to better quantify the systematic\nerror due to finite size effects, we plan to extend our analysis on lattices with different spatial sizes.\nBy having determined the fit parameters, we have then extrapolated eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) to the\nphysical pion and kaon, as follows. We have first used the experimental values of the ratios M\u03c0 / f\u03c0\nand MK /M\u03c0 to determine the average up-down and the strange quark mass respectively. Once these\nmasses have been determined, we have used again eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) to compute the values of the\npion and kaon decay constants as well as their ratio fK / f\u03c0 .\n\n4. Physical results\nIn order to convert into physical units the results obtained for the strange quark mass and\nthe kaon decay constants we have fixed the scale within each analysis (polynomial, PQChPT and\nC-PQChPT fits) by using f\u03c0 as physical input. In the case of the polynomial and PQChPT fits\nwe conservatively introduce for the dimensionful quantities a 6% and 3% of systematic error to\ntake into account the different scale estimate derived in the analysis over the lightest four unitary\npoints [1, 2].\nThe determination of the physical strange and up-down quark masses also requires implementing a renormalization procedure. The relation between the bare twisted mass at maximal twist, \u03bcq ,\nand the renormalized quark mass, mq , is given by mq (\u03bcR ) = Zm (g2 , a\u03bcR ) \u03bcq (a), where \u03bcR is the\nrenormalization scale, conventionally fixed to 2 GeV for the light quarks. Zm is the inverse of\nthe flavour non-singlet pseudoscalar density renormalization constant, Zm = ZP\u22121 . We have used\nthe non-perturbative RI-MOM determination of ZP , which gives ZPRI\u2212MOM (1/a) = 0.39(1)(2) at\n\u03b2 = 3.9 [10], and converted the result to the MS scheme at the scale \u03bcR = 2 GeV by using renormalization group improved continuum perturbation theory at the N3 LO [11].\n5\n\n\fLight quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants from N f = 2 tmQCD\n\nCecilia Tarantino\n\nFit\n\nmMS\nud (MeV)\n\nmMS\ns (MeV)\n\nms /mud\n\nfK (MeV)\n\nfK / f\u03c0\n\nPolynomial\n\n4.07(9)(33)\n\n109(2)(9)\n\n26.7(2)(0)\n\n158.7(11)(89)\n\n1.214(8)(0)\n\nPQChPT\n\n3.82(15)(25)\n\n107(3)(7)\n\n27.9(2)(0)\n\n160.2(15)(54)\n\n1.225(11)(0)\n\nC-PQChPT\n\n3.74(13)(21)\n\n102(3)(6)\n\n27.4(3)(0)\n\n161.8(10)(0)\n\n1.238(7)(0)\n\nTable 1: Results for the light quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants, in physical units, from\nthe polynomial, PQChPT and C-PQChPT fits, analysing only the combinations of quark masses satisfying \u03bc2 \u2265 \u03bc1 = \u03bcS . The quoted errors are statistical (first) and systematic (second), the latter coming from\nthe uncertainties in the determination of the lattice scale and of the quark mass renormalization constant.\n\nIn table 1 we collect the results for the light quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants, in\nphysical units, and for the ratios ms /mud and fK / f\u03c0 , as obtained from the polynomial, PQChPT and\nC-PQChPT fits. To be conservative, we consider the results obtained from the analysis of the quark\nmass combinations satisfying the constraint \u03bc2 \u2265 \u03bc1 = \u03bcS which, though being affected by larger\nstatistical errors, are safe from the effects of the potentially divergent chiral logarithms. In table 1\nwe quote as a systematic error within each fit the uncertainty associated with the determination of\nthe lattice spacing and of the quark mass renormalization constant.\nIn order to derive our final estimates for the quark masses and decay constants, we perform\na weighted average of the results of the three analyses presented in table 1 and conservatively\ninclude the whole spread among them in the systematic uncertainty. In this way, we obtain as our\nfinal estimates of the light quark masses the results\nmMS\nud (2 GeV) = 3.85 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.40 MeV\n\n,\n\nmMS\ns (2 GeV) = 105 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 9 MeV ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nand the ratio\nms /mud = 27.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 1.2 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second systematic. For the kaon decay constant and the\nratio fK / f\u03c0 we obtain the accurate determinations\nfK = 161.7 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 3.1 MeV\n\n,\n\nfK / f\u03c0 = 1.227 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b1 0.024 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nAn interesting comparison of our results for the strange quark mass and the ratio fK / f\u03c0 with\nother lattice QCD determinations is illustrated in fig. 3 (see ref. [1] for the full list of references).\nAn important finding of our analysis [1] is that the use of non-perturbative renormalization turns out to play a crucial role in the determination of the quark masses. The estimate\nZPRI\u2212MOM (1/a) = 0.39(1)(2) obtained with the RI-MOM method is in fact significantly smaller\nthan the prediction ZPBPT (1/a) \u2243 0.57(5) given by one-loop boosted perturbation theory (in the\nsame RI-MOM renormalization scheme) [10]. Had we used the perturbative estimate of ZP we\nMS\nwould have obtained mMS\nud (2 GeV) = 2.63 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 0.36 MeV and ms (2 GeV) = 72 \u00b1 2 \u00b1 9 MeV.\nAs shown in fig. 3 (left), our prediction for the strange quark mass in eq. (4.1) is in good agreement with other determinations based on a non-perturbative evaluation of the mass renormalization\nconstant. The non-perturbative renormalization method, therefore, is found to have an important\nimpact that can be even larger than the quenching effect and that should be kept in mind, particularly when combining the lattice results to produce the quark mass final averages.\n6\n\n\fLight quark masses and pseudoscalar decay constants from N f = 2 tmQCD\n\nCP-PACS 01\n(W-Clov, a-->0, PT)\n\nCecilia Tarantino\n\nCP-PACS 01\n(W-Clov, a-->0)\nJLQCD 02\n(W-Clov, a=0.09 fm)\nRBC 04\n(DWF, a=0.12 fm)\nETMC 07\n(TM, a=0.09 fm)\n\nNf=2\n\nJLQCD 02\n(W-Clov, a=0.09 fm, PT)\nALPHA 05\n(W-Clov, a=0.07 fm, SF)\n\nNf=2\n\nSPQcdR 05\n(Wilson, a=0.06 fm, RI-MOM)\nQCDSF-UKQCD 04-06\n(W-Clov, a-->0, RI-MOM)\n\nMILC 04 - Lattice06\n(KS, a-->0)\nNPLQCD 06\n(DWF/KS, a=0.125 fm)\nCP-PACS-JLQCD Lattice06\n(W-Clov, a-->0)\nRBC-UKQCD 07\n(DWF, a=0.12 fm)\nHPQCD-UKQCD 07\n(KS, a-->0)\n\nNf=2+1\n\nRBC 07\n(DWF, a=0.12 fm, RI-MOM)\nETMC 07\n(TM, a=0.09 fm, RI-MOM)\nHPQCD-MILC-UKQCD 04-06\n(KS, a-->0, PT)\n\nNf=2+1\n\nCP-PACS-JLQCD 07\n(W-Clov, a-->0, PT)\n\nPDG 06 Average\nPDG 06 Average\n(Lattice only)\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\nAverage with the updated\nvalue of Vus from Kl3 decays\n\n200\n\n1,05\n\n1,10\n\n1,15\n\n1,20\n\n1,25\n\n1,30\n\n1,35\n\n1,40\n\nfK/f\u03c0\n\nms (2 GeV) [MeV]\n\nFigure 3: Lattice QCD determinations of the strange quark mass (left) and of the ratio fK / f\u03c0 (right)\nobtained from simulations with N f = 2 and N f = 2 + 1 dynamical fermions.

We obtain\n|Vus |/|Vud | = 0.2251(5)(47), where the first error is the experimental one and the second is the\ntheory error coming from the uncertainty on fK / f\u03c0 . It yields, combined with the determination\n|Vud | = 0.97377(27) [15] from nuclear beta decays, the estimate |Vus | = 0.2192(5)(45), in agreement with the value extracted from Kl3 decays, |Vus | = 0.2255(19) [13], and leads to the constraint\ndue to the unitarity of the CKM matrix |Vud |2 + |Vus |2 + |Vub |2 \u2212 1 = (\u22123.7 \u00b1 2.0) * 10\u22123 .\n\nReferences\n[1] B.
