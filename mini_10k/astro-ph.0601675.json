The\nmost massive black holes must continue to reside in comparatively modest galaxies today, because their number\ndensity inferred from QSO statistics exceeds the present-day abundance of proportionally massive galaxies.\nKey words: galaxies: active galactic nuclei, supermassive black holes\n\n1. Introduction\nThe study of black hole demographics has\nadded a new dimension to research involving active galactic nuclei (AGN). This is rooted in two\ndevelopments of recent years. The first is the availability of measurements of supermassive black\nholes in nearby galaxies, involving observations of\nstellar and gaseous motions with HST along with\nother techniques (reviews by Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001; Ferrarese & Ford 2004; Combes 2005).\nThis has led to the realization that MBH is closely\ncorrelated with the luminosity and especially the\nvelocity dispersion of the bulge component of the\nhost galaxy (Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese &\nMerritt 2000).\nThe local MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relationship is given by\nPreprint submitted to New Astronomy\n\nTremaine et al. (2002) as\nMBH = (108.13 M\u2299 )(\u03c3\u2217 /200 km s\u22121 )4.02 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe rms dispersion of only \u223c 0.3 in log MBH in this\nrelationship suggests a fundamental connection between the evolution of supermassive black holes\nand their host galaxies. The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes has become a focus\nof theoretical study (review by Haiman & Quataert\n2004; Croton 2005, and references therein).\nThe second development is the ability to estimate MBH in AGN based on evidence that the\nbroad emission lines come from gas orbiting the\nblack hole at a radius that can be estimated from\nthe continuum luminosity (Kaspi et al. 2005, and\nreferences therein). Central black hole masses in\nAGN can easily be estimated in this fashion, al13 July 2018\n\n\flowing demographic studies and providing insight\ninto AGN physics. Results below assume a cosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n2. Black Holes in QSOs\nDirect measurements of nuclear black holes,\nbased on spatially resolved measurements of the\nvelocities of stars and gas within the gravitational\nsphere of influence of the hole, are limited to\nnearby objects with negligible look-back times.\nQSOs afford an opportunity to study the MBH \u2212\u03c3\u2217\nrelationship as a function of cosmic time. However,\nthis requires a measurement of the luminosity or\nvelocity dispersion of the host galaxy in addition\nto the black hole mass. The host galaxy luminosity\nand the stellar velocity dispersion are difficult to\nmeasure directly at high redshift, given the glare\nof the active nucleus. An alternative approach is\nto estimate \u03c3\u2217 through the use of some surrogate\ninvolving emission lines of gas orbiting in the host\ngalaxy.\nNelson & Whittle (1996) found that, on average, the width of [O iii] tracks the stellar velocity\ndispersion, \u03c3[O III] \u2261 FWHM([O III])/2.35 \u2248 \u03c3\u2217 .\nThis is supported by the agreement of MBH and\n\u03c3[O III] in nearby AGN with the local MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217\nrelationship (Nelson 2000). Further support comes\nfrom the study of Bonning et al. (2005), who found\noverall agreement between \u03c3[O III] in low redshift\nQSOs and the value of \u03c3\u2217 implied by the measured\nhost galaxy luminosity and the Faber-Jackson relation. The rms scatter is \u223c 0.13 in log \u03c3[O III] at\nfixed host luminosity. This suggests that \u03c3[O III]\nmay be a useful proxy for \u03c3\u2217 in statistical studies,\nalthough not for individual objects.\nShields et al. (2003) carried out such a program\nusing the narrow [O iii] \u03bb5007 emission line of\nQSOs. They collected measurements of the widths\nof the broad H\u03b2 line and narrow [O iii] line in QSOs\nranging in redshift from z < 0.1 to z = 3.3. Black\nhole masses were derived from the expression\n2\nMBH = (107.69 M\u2299 )v3000\nL0.5\n44 ,\n\nFig. 1. Deviations from the local MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relationship, \u2206 log MBH , as a function of redshift. Filled squares:\nH\u03b2 - [O iii] results from Shields et al. (2003); small circles: H\u03b2 - [O iii] and Mg ii - [O ii] results from Salviander\net al. (2006); open triangles: [O iii] measured from spectra by Sulentic et al. (2004, see text and Table 1); crosses:\nH\u03b2 - [O iii] results from Netzer et al. (2004) and Shemmer\net al. (2004); large open circles: high redshift CO QSOs\nfrom Shields et al. (2006), who suggest a recalibration\ndownward by \u223c 0.5 from the values shown.\n\nL44 \u2261 \u03bdL\u03bd /(1044 erg s\u22121 ), the continuum luminosity at 5100 \u00c5, based on Kaspi et al. (2000).\nThey expressed their results in terms of the deviation of an object's actual MBH from the value\nM\u03c3 expected on the basis of Equation 1 using\n\u03c3[O III] . We follow their use of \u2206 log MBH \u2261\nlog MBH \u2212 log M\u03c3 . Figure 1 shows the results\nfor \u2206 log MBH as a function of redshift. There\nis considerable scatter, but overall the objects\nshow little systematic offset from Equation 1 as a\nfunction of redshift. Shields et al. concluded that\nMBH at z \u223c 2 differs by less than 0.5 dex from the\npresent day value expected for a given \u03c3\u2217 . However, the high redshift objects have larger masses\n(MBH \u2248 109.6 M\u2299 ) than the low redshift objects\n(\u223c 108.3 M\u2299 ), so the evolutionary comparison\ninvolves some disparity in mass.\nSalviander et al. (2006; see also these proceedings) used these methods to assess the evolution of\nthe MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relationship in the QSOs in Data\n\n(2)\n\nwhere v3000 \u2261 FWHM(H\u03b2)/3000 km s\u22121 and\n2\n\n\fRelease 3 (DR3) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 1 (SDSS; Abazajian et al. 2005). They used\nH\u03b2 and [O iii] for redshifts up to 0.8, and the\nbroad Mg ii \u03bb2800 and narrow [O ii] \u03bb3727 emission lines to reach redshifts up to 1.2. Their results,\nincluded in Figure 1, nominally show a rise of \u223c\n0.5 in \u2206 log MBH from z \u223c 0.3 to z \u223c 1.0. However, they show that two sources of bias contribute\nto this apparent evolution. (1) The scatter in the\nlocal MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relationship causes some galaxies\nto harbor exceptionally large black holes. If these\nare fueled in proportion to their mass, their high\nluminosities cause them to be over-represented in\nthe QSO sample. (2) There is a tendency in data of\nmarginal signal/noise quality to fail to detect wider\nlines, over-representing narrower [O iii] lines in the\nsample. Subtracting these biases, which both act\nto give an increase in \u2206 log MBH with redshift, Salviander et al. find a residual evolution of 0.3 \u00b1 0.3\nin \u2206 log MBH at redshift unity.\nCO emission lines afford an opportunity to study\nQSO host galaxies at higher redshifts. Shields et\nal. (2006) used \u03c3CO \u2261 FWHM(CO)/2.35 together\nwith MBH derived from the broad Mg ii and\n[C iv] lines to assess the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relationship\nin QSOs up to z = 6.4. They find large black holes\n(\u223c 109.5 M\u2299 ) that are at least an order of magnitude larger than expected for the CO line width\n(see Figure 1). These giant black holes in the early\nuniverse evidently reside in comparatively modest\ngalaxies, as found for the case of SDSS J1148+5251\n(z = 6.4) by Walter et al. (2005).\nFigure 1 summarizes a variety of measurements\nof \u2206 log MBH as a function of redshift. Included are\na number of z \u223c 2 QSOs from Netzer et al. (2004)\nand Shemmer et al. (2004), as selected by Bonning et al. (2005). The six radio-loud objects have\na mean \u2206 log MBH of \u22120.4. Also shown are nine\nQSOs from the study of Sulentic et al. (2004). For\nthese, we have measured the [O iii] width from the\nVLT spectra of Sulentic et al., kindly provided by\nP. Marziani (personal communication). We made\na direct measurement of the FWHM of the \u03bb5007\nline for those objects having adequate [O iii] intensity and not having excessive [Fe ii] emission,\nkeeping nine of 17 objects. We measured the con1\n\ntinuum flux at 5100 \u00c5 rest wavelength from the\nspectra, derived the luminosity (for our cosmology), and calculated MBH from Equation 2 taking\nFWHM(H\u03b2) from Sulentic et al. The VLT measurements have a mean \u2206 log MBH = 0.31, or 0.48\nincluding only the radio-quiet objects. Altogether,\nthese results are consistent with the conclusion of\nShields et al.

Does [O iii] track \u03c3\u2217 in AGN?\nWe noted above some indications that \u03c3[O III]\nmay be a useful surrogate for \u03c3\u2217 in a statistical\nsense. Figure 2, based on Bonning et al. (2005),\ncompares \u03c3[O III] with \u03c3\u2217 in a wide variety of AGN.\nBecause of the scatter in \u03c3[O III] at fixed \u03c3\u2217 , a wide\ndynamic range in \u03c3\u2217 is needed to clarify the overall\ntrend. For lower luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxies), direct measurements of \u03c3\u2217 are used. For QSOs,\nin which \u03c3\u2217 is difficult to measure, \u03c3\u2217 is inferred\nfrom MBH and Equation 1. We include here the\nVLT results of Table 1 and, at very low \u03c3\u2217 the\n\nThe SDSS Web site is http://www.sdss.org/.\n\n3\n\n\fzer 2003; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; Shields & Gebhardt\n2004). If the black hole masses are correct, this implies a breakdown of the local MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relationship at high MBH .\nMcLure & Dunlop (2004), in a study of SDSS\nQSOs, find values of MBH up to \u223c 1010 M\u2299 , but\nthey dismiss the largest values as resulting from\nthe scatter in deriving MBH from expressions like\nEquation 2. Thus they conclude that black holes\nin QSOs are consistent with the maximum mass\nMBH \u223c 109.5 M\u2299 found in giant elliptical galaxies,\nsuch as M87 (Tremaine et al. 2003). There is indeed\nscatter in the BLR radius as a function of luminosity (Kaspi et al. 2000), which underlies Equation 1.\nHowever, we argue here that the large values of\nMBH in the most luminous quasars are likely real.\nIn the QSO sample of Shields et al. (2003), there\nare eight radio-quiet objects with log \u03bdL\u03bd (5100) \u2265\n46.6; and of these, five have log MBH \u2265 9.7, substantially exceeding the largest MBH in local galaxies. Here we are dealing with a majority of the objects of a class selected by a criterion that does not\ninvolve the scatter in Equation 2. Thus, one cannot appeal to scatter to dismiss the large values.\nThese six objects have an average log L/LEd \u2248\n\u22120.1, suggesting that MBH cannot be much less\nthan derived from the H\u03b2 width.\nWhat is the present-day density of these giant\nblack holes? From the QSO luminosity function of\nBoyle et al. (2003), we estimate the space density of\nQSOs with log \u03bdL\u03bd (5100) > 46.6 to be \u223c 6 Gpc\u22123\n(comoving) at z = 2. Since they are nearly at the\nEddington limit, we take their lifetime to be the\nSalpeter e-folding time of 50 million years (efficiency 0.1c2 ). Applying the above fraction of 5/8\nand taking an effective QSO epoch of 3 billion years\n(Warren, Hewitt, & Osmer 1994), we find the density of relic black holes over 5 billion M\u2299 to be \u223c\n102.3 Gpc\u22123 .\nBy the local MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 and MBH \u2212 Mbulge\nrelationships (Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001),\na black hole of 5 billion M\u2299 corresponds to\n\u03c3\u2217 \u2248 500 km s\u22121 and Mbulge \u2248 1012.6 M\u2299 . The\nlargest local giant ellipticals (e.g., M87) have\n\u03c3\u2217 \u2248 350 km s\u22121 (Faber et al. 1997), and the velocity dispersion function of SDSS galaxies ends\nat \u223c 400 km s\u22121 (Sheth et al. 2003).

See Bonning\net al. for details and references. This figure follows Bonning\net al. in using a slightly different formula for MBH from\nEquation 2.\n\ndwarf Seyfert galaxy POX 52 (Barth et al. 2004).\nThere is a clear trend of increasing \u03c3[O III] with \u03c3\u2217 ,\nconsistent with the idea that [O iii] is a valid, if\nnoisy, surrogate.\nGreene & Ho (2005) compare \u03c3\u2217 with the widths\nof several narrow emission lines in a sample of\nnarrow-line Seyfert galaxies from SDSS. They find\nthat \u03c3[O II] agrees in the mean with \u03c3\u2217 . However,\n\u03c3[O III] exceeds \u03c3\u2217 by \u223c 0.13 dex unless a correction is made for the extended blue wing of the\n[O iii] profile. In contrast, Salviander et al. (2006)\nfind that \u03c3[O III] and \u03c3[O II] agree within a few hundredths of a dex in their sample of SDSS QSOs,\nwithout any correction for the blue wing. It is important to clarify the effect of the blue wing on\n\u03c3[O III] in various classes of AGN, and how best to\ncorrect for it.\n\n4. Homelessness Amongst the Largest\nBlack Holes\nSeveral authors have noted that the largest black\nhole masses, inferred in the most luminous QSOs\nfrom broad line widths or the Eddington limit, exceed the largest values of MBH found in the local\nuniverse, and the implied values of \u03c3\u2217 by Equation 1 exceed the largest \u03c3\u2217 values in galaxies (Net4\n\n\fies in SDSS with \u03c3\u2217 > 500 km s\u22121 in a volume\n\u223c 0.5 Gpc3 among the objects for which they\nfind the evidence for superposition to be weakest.\nThe nearest black hole with mass \u2265 109.7 M\u2299\nshould be at a distance of \u223c 100 Mpc and redshift\nof \u223c 7000 km s\u22121 . Wyithe (2006) and Wyithe &\nLoeb (2003) reach a similar conclusion based on the\nassumption that the most luminous QSOs shine\nat the Eddington limit. This distance corresponds\nto the largest cD galaxies, such as NGC 6166 in\nAbell 2199 and NGC 7720 in Abell 2634. Such\ngalaxies may be a logical place to look for a 5 billion solar mass hole. However, such a black hole\nin NGC 6166 or NGC 7720 would violate Equation 1, since these galaxies have central velocity\ndispersions \u223c 350 km s\u22121 (Tonry 1984).\nThe space density of galaxy clusters with\n\u03c3v > 500 km s\u22121 (Bahcall et al. 2003) exceeds\nby an order of magnitude our derived density of\nblack holes over 5 billion solar masses. Ample\ndark matter halos at this velocity dispersion exist\nin the modern universe, but not individual galaxies. Evidently, at this value of \u03c3\u2217 , the physics of\nbaryon assembly is such that giant black holes can\nform in the early universe but the growth of their\nhost galaxies is stunted. Perhaps this involves the\ndisruptive effect of the QSO luminosity (Benson\net al. 2003; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; di Matteo et al.\n2005). The giant holes in the CO quasars discussed\nabove appear destined to remain in galaxies of\ncomparatively modest proportions.\nWe thank K. Gebhardt, J. Greene, and B.\nWills for useful discussions.
