N. Lau, Senior Member, IEEE\n\nHere are two important technologies that could substantially enhance the uplink performance of cellular systems, namely the multi-user detection (MUD) and the macrodiversity (MDiv). The MUD is effective to mitigate intra-cell\ninterference while the MDiv is effective to exploit of inter-cell\ninterference from adjacent base stations. It is well-known that\njointly maximum likelihood multi-user detection (ML MUD)\nis optimal but with exponential order of complexity with\nrespect to (w.r.t.) the number of users in the system. There\nare a lot of research works on low complexity MUD such\nas the linear MUD [1], [2] and the successive interference\ncancellation (SIC) [3], [4]. In [5], [6], the authors analyzed\nthe system goodput (bit/s/Hz successfully delivered to mobile\nuser) for multi-access channels with minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) detector. However, the MMSE MUD cannot\nachieve Pareto optimality in the capacity region. On the other\nhand, MUD-SIC is a promising technology at the base station\nto mitigate intra-cell interference at reasonably low complexity. In this paper, we study the uplink performance analysis\nof an outage-limited multi-cell system with both MUD-SIC at\n\neach base station and MDiv between adjacent base stations.\nWhile there are quite a number of works studying the MUD\ndesign and performance analysis on single cell systems [7],\n[8], there are still a number of open technical challenges to\napply MUD-SIC in multi-cell systems with MDiv. They are\nelaborated in the following:\n\u2022 Per-user Outage and Error Propagation in MUD-SIC\nConventional performance analysis of multi-access fading\nchannel is usually based on the ergodic capacity [9],\n[10]. Uplink power adaptation for multiaccess channel\nis addressed in [11], [12], [13] where the transmit power\nof mobile users are optimized with respect to a system\nobjective function of user capacities. However, in all these\nworks, they did not take into account of the potential\npacket errors (and the error propagation effects in the SIC\nprocess) due to channel outage. When error-propagation\neffect of the MUD-SIC is considered, the packet error\nevents between the K users are coupled together and the\noutage event cannot be determined by whether the rate\nvector is inside the capacity region or not1 .\n\u2022 Power and Decoding Order Optimization One of the\nconsequence of the per-user outage and error propagation effects is that the system goodput cannot scale\nwith SNR due to potential mutual interference between\nusers. To alleviate this issue, optimization of transmit\npower and decoding order in MUD-SIC is needed. Yet,\nsuch optimization problem (taking into account of error\npropagation) is extremely complicated and has not been\naddressed in the literature.\n\u2022 Macro-Diversity In multi-cell systems, macro-diversity\n(MDiv) enhances signal detection by exploiting the intercell interference [14], [15]. For instance, packet detection is terminated at each base station locally and the\ndecoded packets from the base stations (in the active set)\nare delivered to a base station controller where packet\nselection is performed. Macro-diversity is a well studied\ntechnique in CDMA systems with single-user detection\nat the base station. However, it is not clear how the MDiv\ncould alleviate the error propagation effects in the multicell network with MUD-SIC.\nIn this paper, we attempt to address the above issues.\nWe consider an uplink of a multi-cell system with nB base\n\nManuscript received October 20, 2008; revised January 5, 2010; accepted\nMay 17, 2010.

(e-mail:\nwingn@ece.ubc.ca; eeknlau@ee.ust.hk).\n\n1 For example, whether the 2nd decoded packet is successful depends not\nonly on the channel condition of that user but also on whether the 1st decoded\npacket is successful. Furthermore, even if a rate vector is outside the multiaccess capacity region, some user(s) may still be able to decode the packet\nsuccessfully. This substantially complicated the analysis.\n\nAbstract-In this paper, we analyze the uplink goodput\n(bits/sec/Hz successfully decoded) and per-user packet outage in\na cellular network using multi-user detection with successive\ninterference cancellation (MUD-SIC). We consider non-ergodic\nfading channels where microscopic fading channel information\nis not available at the transmitters. As a result, packet outage\noccurs whenever the data rate of packet transmissions exceeds\nthe instantaneous mutual information even if powerful channel\ncoding is applied for protection. We are interested to study the\nrole of macro-diversity (MDiv) between multiple base stations on\nthe MUD-SIC performance where the effect of potential errorpropagation during the SIC processing is taken into account.\nWhile the jointly optimal power and decoding order in the MUDSIC are NP hard problem, we derive a simple on/off power\ncontrol and asymptotically optimal decoding order with respect\nto the transmit power. Based on the information theoretical\nframework, we derive the closed-form expressions on the total\nsystem goodput as well as the per-user packet outage probability.\nWe show that the system goodput does not scale with SNR due\nto mutual interference in the SIC process and macro-diversity\n(MDiv) could alleviate the problem and benefit to the system\ngoodput.\nIndex Terms-Successive interference cancellation, error propagation, macro-diversity, optimal decoding order, order statistics.\n\nI.

We derive\nthe closed-form expressions on the average system goodput\nas well as the per-user packet outage probability of the\nMUD-SIC detection under macro-diversity and potential errorpropagation in the SIC process. While joint power and decoding order optimization is a N P hard problem, we derive a\nsimple on/off power control and decoding ordering which is\nasymptotically optimal w.r.t. the transmit power.

However, adaptation w.r.t. microscopic fading\nis challenging especially for fast moving mobiles because the\ncorresponding channel state information need to be updated at\nthe base stations in a frequent manner. These updates increase\nthe signalling overhead significantly and the computational\ncomplexity [16], [17] at the base stations. As a result, in this\npaper we assume that the power and data rates of the K users\nare adaptive w.r.t. long-term fading (path loss and shadowing).\nC. Centralized Controller Processing\nThe centralized controller is responsible for determining\na user assignment set of each base station3 and a set of\nusers who need MDiv to enhance the performance. The bth base station should pass the estimated macroscopic fading\ncoefficients (average path loss and shadowing) from all K\nusers to the centralized controller. After collecting all the\nmacroscopic fading information from the nB base stations, the\ncentralized controller compares the differences of average path\nloss and shadowing effect, i.e., gi,b , between each mobile user\nand all the base stations with a predefine threshold \u25b3threshold,\nand then sends out the MDiv users list to all base stations.\nFurthermore, for those mobile users who require MDiv, the\ndecoded messages are passed to the centralized controller from\nthe corresponding base stations. Then the controller selects a\n2 The proposed system model is a generalized model of CDMA, since the\nconstant spreading factor/ processing gain can be treated as a multiplicative\nfactor and absorbed in the path loss variables.\n3 Mapping of the K users w.r.t. n\nB base station is not the focus of this\npaper in which users are assumed to be associated with the strongest base\nstation.

MUD-SIC Processing and Per-User Packet Error Model\nIn this paper, we assume that the base stations are equipped\nwith synchronous multi-user detector with successive interference cancellation. Furthermore, we assume that the base\nstations have knowledge of the channel statistic of multipath\nfading, average path loss and shadowing for all mobile users\nby long term measurement. On the other hand, the mobile\nstations do not have channel state information (CSI) and power\nallocation in the uplink are calculated at the base station and\nfed forward to the mobile stations.

If strong error correction\ncode is applied to the packet, the conditional average packet\nerror rate (PER) of the user k (conditioned on the path loss\nand shadowing realization) can be expressed as\nPERk (rk , Pk ; G) \u2248 Poutk (rk , Pk ; G)\nX Y\n=\n{Pr [rk > Cb (H,G, \u03c0b , k)|\u03c0b , G] Pr(\u03c0b )} ,(7)\n\u03c0b \u2208Bk b\u2208Bk\n\nwhere the first summation accounts for all the possible combinations of decoding order in |Bk | number of MDiv stations.\nTherefore, the average system goodput (conditioned on the\npath loss and shadowing matrix G) is given by\n\"K\n#\nX\nUgp (P, R, \u03a0; G) = EH\n\u03c1k |G\n= EH\n\n(\n\nk=1\n\nK\nX\n\n\u0001\n\n)\n\nrk 1 \u2212 Poutk (rk , Pk ; G) |G .\n\nk=1\n\n(8)\n\nNote that the average system goodput and PER are both\nfunctions of the transmission power of users and the decoding\norder. In the next section, we shall derive the optimal transmit\npower of each user and the asymptotically optimal decoding\norder w.r.t. the transmit power.\n\nIII. P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS\nIn this section, we shall analyzes the average system goodput and per-user outage probability of the MUD-SIC system\ntaking into account of transmission power, potential error\npropagation and macro-diversity.\n5 The cardinality of B is one if user k is assigned to one base station and\nk\nno MDiv will be performed.\n\n\f4\n\nA. Optimal Power Transmission Level with MUD-SIC under\nMacro-Diversity\n\nPk = {0, Pmax },\n\n\u2200k\n\n(9)\n\nThis lemma suggests that a user either transmits at full power\nor does not transmit at all.\nProof: Please refer to Appendix A.\nB. Asymptotically Optimal Decoding Order with MUD-SIC\nunder Macro-diversity\nIn the existing literature, the decoding order of successive\ninterference cancellation is usually designed to either minimize the transmit power subject to performance requirement\nconstraints or to maximize system capacity with power constraint. In [21], the authors show that solving for optimal\ndecoding order is N P-hard when the decoding order is jointly\noptimized with power allocation, but can be approximated\nby means of the discrete stochastic approximation (DSA)\nalgorithm. In [22], the authors show that for any point on\nthe boundary of the capacity region, the optimal decoding\npolicy is successive decoding with the same decoding order\nof users for all channel, when the mobile station has perfect CSIT. However, these results failed to account for the\npacket errors in slow fading channels. Furthermore, due to\nthe mutual coupling of the outage events in the MUD-SIC\nprocessing, the optimal decoding order, which is given by\n\u03a0\u2217 = arg max Ugoodput (P, R, \u03a0; G), is very complicated\n\u03a0\nand requires exhaustive search in general. Yet, we shall\nshow in Lemma 2 that a simple decoding ordering would be\nasymptotically optimal for large transmit power.\nLemma 2 (Asymptotically Optimal Decoding Order): For\na given path loss realization G, let Ab (G) = {1, 2, . . . , \u03bcb }\nbe the set of active users (users with non-zero transmit\npower). Suppose all the users have the same conditional\naverage PER requirement, i.e., PERk (rk , Pk ; G) = \u01eb, then\nthe following decoding order is asymptotically optimal for\nsufficiently large Pmax .\n\n3.5\nAverage system goodput (bit/s/Hz)\n\nTraditionally, power control is employed to eliminate the\nnear/far problem by maintaining equal received SINR among\nall mobile users when base stations are configured to perform\nsingle user detection [19]. On the other hand, for ML detection\nat the base station, the optimal power control (under peak\npower constraint) to maximize the ergodic sum capacity is\nsimply for each user to transmit at its maximum power [20].\nYet, in our case of outage-limited MUD-SIC with potential\nerror-propagation, it is not obvious if all the users should\ntransmit at their maximum power due to potential interference\nin the SIC process. In the following lemma, we prove that\na simple on/off power control is asymptotically optimal with\nrespect to high transmit power in the outage limited case.\nLemma 1 (Optimal Power Allocation): With the same peak\npower constraint 0 \u2264 Pk \u2264 Pmax for all users, the optimal\npower allocation that maximizes the instantaneous mutual\ninformation in the outage-limited MUD-SIC system (with\npotential error propagation) is given by the simple on/off rule:\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\nExhaustive search of optimal decoding order\nAsymptotically optimal decoding order\n\n1.5\n\n\u221216\n\n\u221214\n\n\u221212\n\n\u221210\n\u22128\n\u22126\n\u22124\nMax. transmit power (dBmW)\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\nFig. 2.

Given the asymptotically optimal decoding\norder policy in (10), we assume that for user \u03c0b\u2217 (i) fails in the\ni-th decoding iteration, then we can declare packet error for all\nthe remaining users in the same base station. This assumption\ncause a neglectable sub-optimality to the system performance\nwhich can be verified by numerical simulation, however, it\ncan provide a tractable analysis expression and provide some\nimportant insights regarding the system performance.\nNext, we define the event Si which is given by\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011o\nSi = I r\u03c0b\u2217 (i) < log2 1 + SINR\u03c0b\u2217 (i)\n= {0, 1}, (11)\nwhere SINR\u03c0b\u2217 (i) =\n\n1+\n\nP\n\n\u03b3\u03c0\u2217 (i)\nb\n\nj<i \u03b3\u03c0 \u2217 (j) (1\u2212Sj )+\nb\n\nP\n\nj>i\n\n\u03b3\u03c0\u2217 (j)\n\nis the\n\nb\n\nsignal-to-interference plus noise ratio and I(*) is the indicator\nfunction which is 1 when the event is true and 0 otherwise.\nSince we assume that any packet error before the i-th stage will\nresult decoding error in the remaining stages, we can define\nthe following event\n!)\n(\n\u03b3\u03c0b\u2217 (i)\nP\n.

Per-user PER and Average System Goodput\nUnder the asymptotically optimal decoding order in Lemma\n2, the average system goodput and per-user outage probability\ncan be expressed in term of the conditional outage probability.\nIn order to solve the per-user outage probability and average\nsystem goodput, we should obtain the closed form expression\nof the conditional outage probability. For a given asymptotically optimal decoding order \u03c0b\u2217 , the conditional outage\nprobability of user k in the j-th iteration can be expressed as:\nPr [Oj = 0|\u03c0b\u2217 ] = Pr(rk > C\u03c0b\u2217 (k) (H, G, \u03c0b\u2217 , k)|\u03c0b\u2217 )\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\nub\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\nX\n= Pr \u03b3\u03c0b\u2217 (j) \u2212 \u03b8\u03c0b\u2217 (j)\n\u03b3\u03c0b\u2217 (l) < \u03b8k\n(16)\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\nl=j+1\n\nwhere \u03b8k = 2rk \u2212 1.

However, by taking the advantage of the\nadditive Markov chain property from the exponential random\nvariable order statistics, the conditional outage probability\ncan be calculated by a one dimensional integration. We first\nintroduce the following lemma.\nLemma 3 ( Closed-form Expression of Conditional PER):\nThe conditional outage probability of user k in the j-th\niteration in (16) can be written in a summation of exponential\nfunctions which is given by\nPr [Oj = 0|\u03c0b\u2217 ] =\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03bcb\nX\n\n\u03a8l\n\nl=j,\u03c5l >0\n\nwhere \u03a8l =\nl\nP\n\n1\ng\u03c0 \u2217 (u),b\n\nQ\u03bcb\n\n\u03c5l\ni=j,i6=l \u03c5 \u2212 \u03b2l \u03c5i , \u03c5l\nl\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\n\u03b8k \u03b2l\n\u03b2l\nexp(\u2212\n)(17)\n\u03c5l\n\u03c5l\n\n1\u2212l\u00d7\u03b8k +j\u00d7\u03b8k\n,\nl\n\n\u03b2l =\n\ni\n\n, and \u03b8k = 2rk \u2212 1.\nProof: Please refer to Appendix C.\nAfter obtaining the closed-form of the conditional outage\nprobability, we need to calculate the probability of a particular\ndecoding order which is summarized in the following:\nu=1\n\nPmax l\n\nPoutk (rk , Pmax ; G)\n\nX\n\u2264\n\nY\n\n\u03c0b \u2217 \u22121 (k)\n\nY\n\n\u03c0b\u2217\u22121 (k)\n\nX\n\nX\n=\n\nPr [Oj = 0|\u03c0b\u2217 ] Pr(\u03c0b\u2217 )\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c0b\u2217 \u2208Bk b\u2208Bk\n\ni\nX\n\n\uf8f1\ni \uf8f2\nX X\ni=1\n\n\u03c0b\u2217 \u2208Bk b\u2208Bk\n\nj=1\n\nPr(\u03c0b\u2217 )\n\n\uf8f3\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03bcb\nX\n\nl=j,\u03c5l >0\n\n\uf8fc\n\u03b8k \u03b2l \uf8fd\n\u03b2l\n) Pr(\u03c0b\u2217 )\n\u03a8l exp(\u2212\n\u03c5l\n\u03c5l \uf8fe\n\n(19)\n\nrk\n\nwhere\nis given in equation (19) and \u03b8k = 2 \u2212 1.\nTherefore, the average system goodput can be summarized by\nthe following theorem:\nTheorem 1 (Lower Bound for the Average System Goodput ):\n\n\u2217\n\nUgp (P, R, \u03a0 ; G) =\n\n\u2265\n\nK\nX\n\n=\n\nK\nX\n\nrk 1 \u2212\n\nrk \u00d7\n\nk=1\n\nX\n\nY\n\n\u03c0b\u2217 \u2208Bk b\u2208Bk\n\n|\n\nrk (1 \u2212 Pout (rk , Pk ; G))\n\nk=1\n\n(\n\nk=1\n\nK\nX\n\n(\n\nX\n\nY\n\n\u03c0b\u2217\u22121 (k)\n\ni\nX X\ni=1\n\n\u03c0b\u2217 \u2208Bk b\u2208Bk\n\nPr [Oj =\n\n)\n\n0|\u03c0b\u2217 ] Pr(\u03c0b\u2217 )\n\nj=1\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u001b\n\u03b2l\n\u03b8k \u03b2l\nexp(\u2212\n) Pr(\u03c0b\u2217 ) (20)\n\u03c5l\n\u03c5l\ni=1 j=1 l=j,\u03c5l >0\n{z\n}\nSelection diversity protection\n\n\u03c0b\u2217\u22121 (k)\n\ni\nX X\n\n\u03bcb\nX\n\n\u03a8l\n\nFrom the above expression, the second summation represents\nthe system goodput corresponds to each decoding permutation\nof the decoding rule in equation (10).

We compare the performance\nof the proposed design with a conventional baseline 1 CDMA\npower control algorithm6 in which the transmit powers of\nall users are adjusted such that the received SINR of them\nare the same at base station. For the baseline 1, the system\n6 The data rate in the simulation of CDMA is set to a value such that the\noutage requirement can be fulfilled for the weakest user. For the spreading\nin the CDMA system, we assume the synchronized orthogonal spreading\ncodes are used and the spreading factor is always equal to the number of\nusers. Therefore, the orthogonal multiple access incurs no loss in total system\ncapacity for equal rate and equal SINR users [24].\n\n0\n\n\u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n0\nMax. transmit power (dBmW)\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFig. 4. Average system goodput versus max transmit power with different\nMDiv threshold in a two cells system, K=10. Each user has a outage\nrequirement = 5% and is power controlled by on/off transmission. The double\nsided arrow represents the performance gain due to MDiv. Common outage\nis declared when the rate vector is outside the instantaneous capacity region.\n\ngoodput grows with SNR at small SNR7 but quickly saturated\nat moderate SNR. This is because the performance is always\nlimited by the weakest users. On the other hand, the goodput\nperformance of the proposed on/off power control scheme does\nnot saturate even at high SNR regime. It can be explained\nthat in the proposed on/off power control, strong users do\nnot required to decrease the transmission power to maintain\nthe same SINR as those weak users, this factor contribute\nsignificantly to the system goodput. Furthermore, we compare\nthe proposed design with a baseline 2 (FDMA system) where\neach user transmits at its peak power. Although multiple\naccess interference does not exist in the FDMA system due to\northogonal transmission, it has a very low spectral efficiency.\nOn the contrary, the proposed design provides a substantial\nperformance gain compared with the FDMA system in the\ninterference limited environment.\nFigure 4 shows the average system goodput versus the\ntransmit power with different MDiv threshold (\u25b3threshold ).\nEach user is power controlled by the on/off scheme and\nthere is 5% outage probability requirement. We compare\nthe performance of the proposed design with a system that\ndoes not perform MDiv in which all the inter-cell users are\ntreated as interference. For the system without MDiv, the\naverage system goodput saturated at high SNR because strong\ninterference from inter-cell becomes a dominate factor in the\nsystem performance. On the contrary, the average system\ngoodput of the proposed design increase with the transmit\npower when MDiv is performed in the base station. The\nreason is that strong interference is regarded as desired user\nsignal and it will be decoded by corresponding base station.\nFurthermore, the optimal power control (either full power\ntransmission or completely silent) create a high disparities8\nreceived power at the base station and strong enough interference environment for MDiv to exploit. Therefore, the system\n7 Because all active users are transmitting at their max power, therefore the\nSNR of each user is directly proportional to the max power.\n8 A high disparities received power can significantly increase the system\ncapacity for MUD-SIC receiver [20].\n\n\f7\n\n7\n\n7\nTx power =\u22123dBmW\n\u2206threshold=2dB\n\nTx power =\u22123dBmW\n\u2206threshold=4dB\n\nNoise limited region\nInterference limited region\n6\n\nAverage System Goodput (bit/s/Hz)\n\nAverage system goodput (bit/s/Hz)\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\nInterference\nlimited region\n\n3\n\n5\n\n4\nTx power =\u221210dBmW\n\u2206threshold=4dB\n\n3\n\nTx power=\u22123dBmW , \u2206threshold=2dB\nTx power=\u221210dBmW , \u2206threshold=4dB\n\nTheoretical result\nTx power=\u22123dBmW,\u2206threshold=2dB\n\nTx power =\u221210dBmW\n\u2206threshold=2dB\n\nTx power=\u22123dBmW , \u2206threshold=4dB\n2\n\nTheoretical result\nTx power=\u221210dBmW,\u2206threshold=4dB\n\n2\n\nTheoretical result\nTx power=\u221210dBmW,\u2206threshold=2dB\n\nNoise limited region\n\nTx power=\u221210dBmW , \u2206threshold=2dB\n1\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\nPath loss exponent\n\n4.5\n\nTheoretical result\nTx power=\u22123dBmW,\u2206threshold=4dB\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n12\nNumber of users\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFig. 5.

Furthermore, the goodput of the joint\nML detection (which consider common outage9 ) is plotted\nfor comparison. In low SNR regime, the SIC outperforms the\njoint ML detection. This is because in the joint ML detection,\na common outage will be declared if the rate vector lies\noutside the instantaneous capacity region. Hence, the outage\nperformance of the joint ML detection is always limited by\nthe weakest users. On the other hand, the SIC approach\nconsider per-user outage and packets for some users may be\ndecoded correctly even though the rate vector lies outside the\ncapacity region. In high SNR region, the performance of SIC\nis limited by strong interference from both intra-cell and intercell interference. Nevertheless, using MDiv, the performance\nof the SIC scheme can be improved at high SNR regime. On\nthe other hand, the joint ML detection does not suffer from\nmulti-user interference and hence the performance is able to\nscale with SNR.\nSimilarly, Figure 5 shows the average system goodput\nversus different value of path loss exponent for K=10. Along\nall the curves, the same user transmit power is fixed at -10\ndBmW and -3 dBmW respectively. It is very interesting that\nthe average system goodput first increase with the value of path\nloss exponent and then decrease when the path loss exponent\nis beyond certain value. This counter intuitive result is due\nto the fact that when the path loss exponent increases, both\ndesired signal and interference signal received by base station\ndecreases. However, the attenuation of interference occurs to\nbe larger than desired signal because interference users are\nusually located far away from desired home base station.\nAs path loss exponent increases, the operating region of the\nsystem is shifting from interference limited region to noise\nlimited region, and the desired users signal strength attenuate\nto a level that high data rate communication is impossible, and\nit results in a decreasing trend of average system goodput.\nFigure 6 depicts that average number of system goodput\n\nversus the number users in a two cells system. Similarly, the\ntransmit power of an active user is again fixed at -10dBmW\nand -3dBmW respectively. It can be observed that the system\ngoodput gain due to MDiv is not significant when the number\nof user is small, especially users are transmitting at low power\n(-10dBmW). When the transmit power is low, signal strength\nof interference can not satisfy the MDiv threshold requirement,\nso there is nearly no MDiv performed in the base stations.\nHowever, when the number of users increases, it is more likely\nthat there exists a user who locates near the cell boundary,\ncreates large interference to neighboring cells. Therefore, base\nstations can take advantage of the strong interference and\nperform MDiv to improve the system goodput. On the other\nhand, there is a diminishing return in the system goodput\nwhen the number of users increases, particular in high transmit\npower with small MDiv threshold value (2dB). This is due\nto the fact that base stations do not fully utilize the benefit\nof strong interference by setting a small threshold value10 ,\ntherefore interference can not be decoded and causes the\ndegradation in system performance.\n\n9 Common outage is declared as rate vector is outside the instantaneous\ncapacity region.\n\n10 A small threshold value implies a few users are satisfied with the MDiv\nrequirement.\n\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a generic multi-cell system with K client\nusers, nB base stations and a centralized controller is considered. Based on the asymptotic optimal decoding order with\nrespect to the transmit power, we incorporate the mathematical\ntool of order statistics to obtain the closed-form solution of\nsystem performance. Numerical simulations result are obtained\nto verify the analytical expressions. The closed form solutions\nallow efficient numerical evaluations to find out how the\nsystem performance is affected by the system parameter such\nas number of users and path loss exponent. From the results,\nwe see that in interference limited region (users transmit at\nhigh power), MDiv improves the system goodput significantly\nby introducing macro-diversity protection to alleviate the\nconsequences of error propagation. Furthermore, system with\n\n\f8\n\nMDiv allows more users to be served at the same time through\ntaking advantage of strong interference.\nA PPENDIX\n\nB. Proof of Lemma 2\nFrom equations (4), (7) and (8), it can be observed that the\noptimal decoding order in maximizing the system capacity is\nequivalent to a decoding order, which maximize the instantaneous mutual information in each decoding iteration at each\nbase station. The total mutual information in the b-th station\ncan be expressed as:\n\nA. Proof of Lemma 1\nNote that since our power constraint is instantaneous, average system goodput maximization is the same as maximize the\ninstantaneous goodput for each fade vector. It can be observed\nK X\nX\nin equation (6) that the system goodput is contributed by the\nCb (H,G, \u03c0b , k)\ninstantaneous channel capacity and transmitted data rate. In\nk=1 b\u2208Bk\u2217\nfact, the system goodput is upper bounded by the instantaneous\nchannel capacity.
