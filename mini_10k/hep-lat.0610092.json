Staggered quarks were introduced\nthirty years ago, but unusually large discretization errors,\nproportional to a2 where a is the lattice spacing, made\nthem useless for accurate simulations. It was only in the\nlate 1990s that we discovered how to remove the leading errors, and the result was one of the most accurate\ndiscretizations in use today. Staggered quarks are faster\nto simulate than other discretizations, and as a result\nhave allowed us for the first time to incorporate (nearly)\nrealistic light-quark vacuum polarization into our simulations. This makes high-precision simulations, with errors\nof order a few percent, possible for the first time (see [1]\nfor a more detailed discussion). In this paper we present\na new discretization that is substantially more accurate\nthan the improved discretization currently in use. With\nthis new formalism accurate simulations will be possible\nat even larger lattice spacings, further reducing simulation costs.\nThe O(a2 ) discretization errors in staggered quarks\nhave two sources. One is the usual error associated with\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: e.follana@physics.gla.ac.uk\n\ndiscretizing the derivatives in the quark action. The\ncorrection for this error is standard and was known in\nthe 1980s [6]. The second source was missed for almost a decade. It results from an unusual property\nof the staggered-quark discretization: the lattice quark\nfield creates four identical flavors or tastes of quark\nrather than one. (We refer to these unphysical flavors\nas \"tastes\" to avoid confusion with the usual quark flavors, which are not identical since quarks of different flavor have different masses.) The missing a2 error was associated with taste-exchange interactions, where taste is\ntransferred from one quark line to another in quark-quark\nscattering. The generic correction for this type of error\ninvolves adding four-quark operators to the discretized\naction.\nTaste is unphysical. Instead of one \u03c0 + , for example, one has sixteen. Taste is easily removed in simulations provided that different tastes are exactly equivalent, which they are, and provided there are no interactions that mix hadrons of different taste. Taste-exchange\ninteractions, however, cause such mixing, and therefore it\nis crucial that we understand such interactions and suppress them. Furthermore, past experience suggests that\nthe errors due to residual taste exchange are the largest\nremaining a2 errors in current simulations.\nThe corrections to the lattice action that suppress taste\nexchange were missed initially because four-quark operators are not usually needed to correct discretization\nerrors in lowest order perturbation theory (that is, at\ntree level). They were first discovered empirically from\nsimulations in which the gluon fields in the quark ac-\n\n\f2\ntion were replaced by smeared fields, which happen to\nsuppress taste-changing quark-quark scattering amplitudes [7]. This discovery led to a proper understanding\nof the taste-exchange mechanism [8, 9], and to the first\ncorrect analysis of the a2 errors in staggered-quark formalisms [8, 10]. The resulting \"ASQTAD\" quark action\nhas provided the basis for almost all simulations to date\nthat include (nearly) realistic light-quark vacuum polarization.\nWhile it is possible to remove all tree-level taste\nexchange by smearing the gluon fields appropriately,\nhigher-order corrections can only be removed by adding\nfour-quark operators. Recent numerical experiments suggest, however, that even these corrections can be significantly suppressed through additional smearing [11].\nThese studies, while very important, were limited in two\nways. First, they used the mass splittings between the\nsixteen tastes of pion as a probe for taste exchange; there\nare many taste-exchange interactions that do not affect\nthis spectrum. Second, smearing the gluon fields introduces other types of O(a2 ) error which undo the advantage of an improved discretization (that is, accuracy at\nlarge values of a).\nIn this paper we present the first rigorous analysis of\none-loop taste exchange. Based upon this analysis we\ndevelop a simple smearing scheme that suppresses oneloop corrections by an order of magnitude on average.\nOur smearing scheme is simpler than that in [11] and,\nunlike that scheme, it does not introduce new a2 errors.\nThe result is a new discretization for highly-improved\nstaggered quarks which we refer to by the acronym HISQ.\nAn added advantage of a highly improved action is that\nit can be used to simulate c quarks. Heavy quarks are difficult to simulate using standard discretizations because\ndiscretization errors are large unless am \u226a 1, where a is\nthe lattice spacing and m the quark mass. To simulate\nb quarks, for example, one would require lattice spacings\nsubstantially smaller than 1/20 fm - much too small to\nbe practical today. Consequently high-quality simulations of b quarks rely upon rigorously defined effective\nfield theories, like nonrelativistic QCD [12], that remove\nthe rest mass from the quark's energy. While this approach works very well for b quarks, it is less successful\nfor c quarks because the quark's mass is much smaller,\nand consequently c quarks are much less nonrelativistic.\nThe smaller quark mass, however, means that amc \u2248 1/2\nfor lattice spacings of order 1/10 fm, which are typical of\nsimulations today. As we demonstrate in this paper, we\ncan obtain few-percent accuracy for charm quarks when\namc \u2248 1/2 provided we use a highly improved relativistic\ndiscretization like HISQ.\nIn Section II we review the (perturbative) origins\nof taste-exchange interactions in staggered quarks, and\ntheir removal at lowest order (tree level) in perturbation\ntheory, using the Symanzik improvement procedure. We\nalso extend the traditional Symanzik analysis to cancel\nall (am)4 errors to leading order in the quark's velocity,\nv/c (in units of the speed of light c). The additional\n\ncorrection needed is negligible for light quarks, but significantly enhances the precision of c-quark simulations.\nIn Section III, we extend our analysis of taste exchange\nto one-loop order, and show how to suppress such contributions by approximately an order of magnitude, thereby\neffectively removing one-loop taste exchange from the\ntheory. The resulting quark action (HISQ) is the first\nstaggered-quark discretization that is both free of lattice\nartifacts through O(a2 ) and effectively free of all taste\nexchange through one-loop order. We also identify the\norder \u03b1s (am)2 corrections to the action that are important for high-precision c physics.\nWe illustrate the utility of our new formalism, in Section IV, first by examining its effect on taste splittings in\nthe pion spectrum. We also show how to directly measure\nthe size of taste-exchange interactions in simulations, by\ncomparing ASQTAD and HISQ simulations. There has\nbeen much discussion recently about the formal significance of taste-exchange interactions [14]. With our procedure it is possible to directly measure the effect of these\ninteractions on physical quantities. We demonstrate the\nprocedure by showing that residual taste-exchange interactions in HISQ contribute less than 1% at current lattice\nspacings to light-quark quantities such as meson masses\nand meson decay constants.\nWe report on a new simulation of c quarks and charmonium using the HISQ formalism in Section V. This is the\nmost severe test of the HISQ formalism since amc \u2248 1/2\nfor the lattice spacings we use, but we show that the formalism delivers results that are accurate to a couple of\npercent, making it the most accurate formalism there is\nfor simulating c quarks. We demonstrate this in a new\nhigh-precision determination of the \u03c8\u2013\u03b7c splitting. This\nanalysis confirms our expectation that the largest a2 errors in the ASQTAD action are associated with taste\nexchange, and we show that these are greatly reduced by\nusing the HISQ action instead.\nThe moderately heavy smearing used in the HISQ\nformalism complicates unquenched simulations. In Section VI, we discuss how these complications can be dealt\nwith. Finally, in Section VII, we summarize our results\nand discuss their relevance to future work. Here we also\npresent our first D physics results from the HISQ action.\nMuch of our discussion is framed in terms of the\n\"naive\" discretization for quarks, which is conceptually\nequivalent to the staggered-quark discretization (see Appendix B). We usually find naive quarks to be more\nintuitive in analytic work than staggered quarks, while\nthe latter formalism is definitely the more useful one for\nnumerical work. We outline the formal connection between the naive-quark and staggered-quark formalisms\nin a series of detailed Appendices. We use these results\nin our one-loop analysis of taste-exchange interactions,\nwhich is described in detail in Appendix F.\nWe used several sets of gluon configurations in this\npaper.

A complete set of\nsixteen spinor matrices can be labeled by four-component\nvectors n\u03bc consisting of 0s and 1s (i.e., n\u03bc \u2208 Z2 ):\n\u03b3n \u2261\n\n3\nY\n\n(\u03b3\u03bc )n\u03bc .\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bc=0\n\nA set of useful gamma-matrix properties is presented in\nAppendix A.\nThe naive-quark action has an exact \"doubling\" symmetry under the transformation:\n\u03c8(x)\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c8\u0303(x) \u2261 \u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 (\u22121)x\u03c1 /a \u03c8(x)\n= \u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 exp(i x\u03c1 \u03c0/a) \u03c8(x).\n\n(5)\n\nThus any low energy-momentum mode, \u03c8(x), of the theory is equivalent to another mode, \u03c8\u0303(x), that has momentum p\u03c1 \u2248 \u03c0/a, the maximum allowed on the lattice. This new mode is one of the \"doublers\" of the naive\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nB\u03b6 (x) \u2261 \u03b3 \u03b6 (\u22121)\u03b6*x/a\nY\n\u03b6\n\u221d\n(\u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 ) \u03c1 exp(i x * \u03b6 \u03c0/a),\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c1\n\nand \u03b6 is a vector with \u03b6\u03bc \u2208 Z2 , while \u03b6 is \"conjugate\"\nto \u03b6 (see Appendix A):\n\u03b6\u03bc \u2261\n\nSYMANZIK IMPROVEMENT FOR\nNAIVE/STAGGERED QUARKS\n\n\u03c8(x) \u2192 \u03c8(x) B\u03b6\u2020 (x)\n\nX\n\n\u03b6\u03bd mod 2\n\n(8)\n\n\u03bd6=\u03bc\n\nConsequently there are 15 doublers in all (in four dimensions), which we label with the fifteen different\nnonzero \u03b6's.\nAs a consequence of the doubling symmetry, the standard low-energy mode and the fifteen doubler modes\nmust be interpreted as sixteen equivalent flavors or\n\"tastes\" of quark. (The sixteen tastes are reduced to four\nby staggering the quark field; see Appendix B.) This\nunusual implementation of quark tastes has surprising\nconsequences. Most striking is that a low-energy quark\nthat absorbs momentum close to \u03b6 \u03c0/a, for one of the\nfifteen \u03b6's, is not driven far off energy-shell. Rather it is\nturned into a low-energy quark of another taste. Thus\nthe simplest process by which a quark changes taste is\nthe emission of a single gluon with momentum q \u2248 \u03b6 \u03c0/a.\nThis gluon is highly virtual, and therefore it must immediately be reabsorbed by another quark, whose taste will\nalso change (see Fig. 1). Taste changes necessarily involve\nhighly virtual gluons, and so are both suppressed (by\na2 ) and perturbative for typical lattice spacings. Onegluon exchange, with gluon momentum q \u2248 \u03b6 \u03c0/a, is\nthe dominant flavor-changing interaction since it is lowest order in \u03b1s (\u03b6\u03c0/a) and involves only 4 external quark\nlines. (Processes with more quark lines are suppressed by\nadditional powers of (ap)3 where p is a typical external\nmomentum.) This observation is crucial when trying to\nimprove naive quarks by removing finite-a errors, as we\ndiscuss below (see also [8, 9, 10]).\nSixteen tastes of quark from a single quark field is fifteen too many. In the absence of taste exchange, factors\nof 1/16 are easily inserted into simulations to remove the\nextra copies. In particular, quark vacuum polarization is\ncorrected by replacing the quark determinant in the path\nintegral by its 1/16 root,\ndet(\u03b3 * \u2206 + m0 ) \u2192 det(\u03b3 * \u2206 + m0 )1/16 ,\n\n(9)\n\nor, equivalently, by multiplying the contribution from\neach quark loop by 1/16. Recent empirical studies of\nthe spectrum of \u03b3 * \u2206, and improved versions of it, show\n\n\f4\nsequently, while taste exchange can lead to such anomalies as unitarity violations, these are suppressed in the\ncontinuum limit. They are further, and more efficiently,\nsuppressed through Symanzik improvement of the action,\nas we now discuss.\n\nB.\n\nFIG. 1: The leading tree-level taste-exchange interaction,\nwhich involves the exchange of a gluon with momentum \u03b6\u03c0/a\nwhere each \u03b6\u03bc is 0 or 1 but \u03b6 2 6= 0.\n\nhow eigenvalues cluster into increasingly degenerate multiplets of sixteen as the lattice spacing vanishes, which is\nnecessary if this procedure is to be useful for quark vacuum polarization [17]. The treatment of valence quarks\nis illustrated in Appendix G.\nIt is easy to see how the 1/16 root corrects for taste\nin particular situations. For example, consider the vacuum polarization of a single pion in a theory of only one\nmassless quark flavor. Ignoring taste exchange, the dominant infrared contributions come from the quark diagrams shown in Fig. 2 (gluons, to all orders, are implicit in these diagrams). The first diagram, with its\ndouble quark loop, has contributions from 162 identical massless pions, corresponding to configurations where\nthe quark and antiquark each carries a momentum close\nto an integer multiple of \u03c0/a (and is therefore close to being on shell). This diagram is multiplied by 1/162 since\nthere are two quark loops, thereby giving the contribution of a single massless pion. The second diagram involves quark annihilation into gluons, and has contributions from 16 identical massless pions, corresponding to\nconfigurations where the quark and antiquark each carries a momentum close to the same \u03b6\u03c0/a (so they can\nannihilate into low-momentum gluons). This diagram is\nmultiplied by 1/16 since there is only one quark loop,\nthereby giving the contribution again of a single massless pion but now with an insertion from the gluon decay.\nInserting additional annihilation kernels results in a geometric series of insertions in the propagator of a single\nmassless pion that shifts the pion's mass away from zero,\nas expected in a U (1) flavor theory.\nSuch patterns are disturbed by taste-exchange interactions like that in Fig. 1. For example, these interactions cause mixing between the different tastes of pion\nin Fig. 2. This mixing lifts the degeneracy in the pion\nmasses so that different tastes of pion are only approximately equivalent. Consequently the \"1/16-root rule\"\ngives results that correspond only approximately to a\nsingle pion. Taste-changing interactions are suppressed\nby a2 , however, and detailed analyses, using chiral perturbation theory, demonstrate that the impact on physical quantities is therefore also suppressed by a2 [18]. Con-\n\nTree-Level Symanzik Improvement\n\nThe discretization errors in the naive-quark action\ncome from two sources. The more conventional of these\ncorrects the finite-difference approximation to the derivatives in the action: one replaces [6]\n\u2206\u03bc \u2192 \u2206\u03bc \u2212\n\na2 3\n\u2206\n6 \u03bc\n\n(10)\n\nin the naive-quark action (Eq. (1)). The a2 correction is\noften referred to as the \"Naik term.\"\nLess conventional is a correction to remove leading order taste-exchange interactions [8, 9, 10]. As discussed\nin the previous section, these interactions result from the\nexchange of single gluons carrying momenta close to \u03b6\u03c0/a\nfor one of the fifteen non-zero \u03b6s (\u03b6\u03bc \u2208 Z2 ). Since these\ngluons are highly virtual, such interactions are effectively\nthe same as four-quark contact interactions and could be\ncanceled by adding four-quark operators to the quark\naction. These operators affect physical results in O(a2 )\nsince they have dimension six. A simpler alternative to\nfour-quark operators is to modify the gluon-quark vertex, \u03c8\u03b3\u03bc U\u03bc \u03c8 + * * * , in the original action by introducing\na form factor f\u03bc (q) that vanishes for (taste-changing)\ngluons with momenta q = \u03b6\u03c0/a for each of the fifteen\nnonzero \u03b6s. In fact the form factor for direction \u03bc need\nnot vanish when \u03b6\u03bc = 1 since the original interaction\nalready vanishes in that case. Consequently we want a\nform factor where\n(\n1 for q \u2192 0\nf\u03bc (q) \u2192\n(11)\n0 for q \u2192 \u03b6\u03c0/a where \u03b6 2 6= 0, \u03b6\u03bc = 0.\nWe can introduce such a form factor by replacing the\nlink operator U\u03bc (x) in the action with F\u03bc U\u03bc (x) where\nsmearing operator F\u03bc is defined by\n(2)\n\nF\u03bc \u2261\n\nY\n\n\u03c16=\u03bc\n\na2 \u03b4 \u03c1\n1+\n4\n\n!\n\n(12)\nsymm.\n\n(2)\n\nand \u03b4\u03c1 approximates a covariant second derivative when\nacting on link fields:\n1\nU\u03c1 (x) U\u03bc (x + a\u03c1\u0302) U\u03c1\u2020 (x + a\u03bc\u0302)\na2\n\u2212 2U\u03bc (x)\n\n\u03b4\u03c1(2) U\u03bc (x) \u2261\n\n\u0001\n+ U\u03c1\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03c1\u0302) U\u03bc (x \u2212 a\u03c1\u0302) U\u03c1 (x \u2212 a\u03c1\u0302 + a\u03bc\u0302) .\n(13)\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 2: Infrared contributions from (naive lattice) quark vacuum polarization corresponding to a pion vacuum polarization\nloop in a simulation of one flavor. The sums are over all infrared sectors, where quarks have momenta near p\u03bc = \u03b6\u03bc \u03c0/a for one\nof the sixteen \u03b6s consisting of just 0s and 1s. The factors of 1/16 are from the 1/16 rule (Eq. (9)) and cancel the sums. Gluons,\nto all orders, are implicit in these diagrams.\n(2)\n\nThis works because \u03b4\u03c1 \u2248 \u22124/a2 (and F\u03bc vanishes) when\nacting on a link field that carries momentum q\u03c1 \u2248 \u03c0/a.\nThis kind of link smearing is referred to as \"Fat7\" smearing in [7].\nSmearing the links with F\u03bc removes the leading\nO(a2 ) taste-exchange interactions, but introduces new\nO(a2 ) errors. These can be removed by replacing F\u03bc\nwith [10]\nF\u03bcASQTAD \u2261 F\u03bc \u2212\n\nX a2 (\u03b4\u03c1 )2\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c16=\u03bc\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c1 approximates a covariant first derivative:\n1\nU\u03c1 (x) U\u03bc (x + a\u03c1\u0302) U\u03c1\u2020 (x + a\u03bc\u0302)\na\n\u0001\n\u2212 U\u03c1\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03c1\u0302) U\u03bc (x \u2212 a\u03c1\u0302) U\u03c1 (x \u2212 a\u03c1\u0302 + a\u03bc\u0302) .\n(15)\n\n\u03b4\u03c1 U\u03bc (x) \u2261\n\nThe new term has no effect on taste exchange but (obviously) cancels the O(a2 ) part of F\u03bc . Correcting the\nderivative, as in Eq. (10), and replacing links by a2 accurate smeared links removes all tree-level O(a2 ) errors\nin the naive-quark action.

When applied to c quarks, however, these errors\nwill be larger. The most important errors in this case\nare associated with the quark's energy, rather than its\n3-momentum, since c quarks are typically nonrelativistic\nin \u03c8s, Ds and other systems of current interest. Consequently E \u2248 m \u226b p and the largest errors are O((am)4 )\nor 6% at current lattice spacings (amc \u2248 0.5). Such errors show up, for example, in the tree-level dispersion\nrelation of the quark where:\nE 2 (p) \u2212 m2\np\u21920\np2\n9\n1\n= 1+\n(am)4 + (am)6 + * * * .\n20\n7\n\nc2 (0) \u2261 lim\n\n(18)\n\nThis dominant (tree-level) error can be removed by\nretuning the coefficient of the a2 \u03b3\u03bc \u22063\u03bc (Naik) term in the\naction:\n!\n\u0013\nX \u0012\nX\na2\n3\n\u03c8(x)\n\u03b3\u03bc \u2206\u03bc \u2212 (1 + \u01eb)\u2206\u03bc + m0 \u03c8(x),\n6\n\u03bc\nx\n\n(19)\n\nwhere parameter \u01eb has expansion\n27\n327\n5843\n(am)2 +\n(am)4 \u2212\n(am)6\n40\n1120\n53760\n153607\n(am)8 \u2212 * * * .\n+\n3942400\n\n\u01eb=\u2212\n\n(20)\n\nWith this choice, c2 = 1+O((am)12 ). Only the first term\nin \u01eb's expansion is essential for removing (am)4 errors;\nthe remaining terms remove errors to higher orders in am\nbut leading order in v/c, the quark's typical velocity. In\npractice, terms beyond the first one or two are negligible\nthough trivial to include.\n\n\f6\nNote that the bare mass m0 in the quark action is\nrelated to the tree-level quark mass by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n23\n3\n(am)4 \u2212\n(am)6 + * * *\nm0 = m 1 +\n80\n2240\n\n(21)\n\nfor this choice of \u01eb. This formula is useful for extracting\nthe corrected bare quark mass, m, from a tuned value\nof m0 .\nTo examine the tree-level errors in this modified ASQTAD action, it is useful to make a nonrelativistic expansion since, as we indicated, heavy quarks are generally\nnonrelativistic in the systems of interest. This expansion\nis easy because the action is identical in form to the continuum Dirac equation, and consequently has the same\nnonrelativistic expansion but with\nD\u03bc \u2192 \u2206\u03bc \u2212\n\na2\n(1 + \u01eb)\u22063\u03bc .\n6\n\n(22)\n\nAt tree level,\n\u2206\u03bc \u2192 sinh(aDt \u2212 am)/a,\n\n(23)\n\nwhen we replace\n\u03c8 \u2192 exp(\u2212mt) \u03c8,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere m is the quark mass.

Taste-changing errors, however, have\ngenerally been much larger than expected. These errors\nalso bear directly on the validity of the 1/16-root trick\nfor accounting for taste in the vacuum polarization. For\nthis reason it is worth trying to further suppress tasteexchange errors beyond what has been accomplished at\ntree level. We show how to do this in this section.\nThe only other one-loop effects that are important at\nthe level of a few percent are \u03b1s (am)2 for heavy quarks,\nand, in particular, the charm quark. We show how to\ncorrect for these errors in the Section III B.\n\nA.\n\nOne-loop taste exchange comes only from the diagrams\nshown in Fig. 3; other one-loop diagrams vanish because\nof the tree-level improvements. Again the gluons in these\ndiagrams transfer momenta of order \u03b6\u03c0/a, and so are\nhighly virtual. Consequently, the correction terms in the\ncorrected action that cancel these will involve currentcurrent interactions that conserve overall taste (because\nof momentum conservation).

This procedure is\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 3: The only one-loop diagrams that result in qq \u2192 qq taste exchange for ASQTAD quarks. Diagrams with additional\nexternal quark lines are suppressed by additional powers of a2 .\n\ncomplicated to implement, however. A simpler procedure\nis suggested by the results in [11]. That analysis shows\nthat repeated smearing of the links further reduces the\nmass splittings between pions of different taste.\nThis result is not surprising given the perturbative origins of taste exchange. The dominant taste-exchange\ninteractions (in ASQTAD) come from the one-loop diagrams in Fig. 3. The largest contributions to these diagrams come from large loop momenta, k = O(\u03b6\u03c0/2a).\nSmearing the links introduces form factors that suppress\nhigh momenta, leaving low momenta unchanged, and\ntherefore should suppress this sort of one-loop correction.\nThe links in the ASQTAD action are smeared, but the operator F\u03bcASQTAD , which smears links in the \u03bc direction,\nintroduces additional links in orthogonal directions (to\npreserve gauge invariance) that are not smeared. Smearing the links multiple times guarantees that all links are\nsmeared, and high momenta are suppressed.\nThere are three problems associated with multiple\nsmearing. One is that it introduces new O(a2 ) discretization errors, and these errors grow with additional\nsmearing. The action presented in [11] suffers from\nthis problem. The a2 errors can be avoided by using\nan a2 -improved smearing operator, such as F\u03bcASQTAD\n(Eq. (14)). Replacing smearing operator\nF\u03bcASQTAD \u2192 F\u03bcASQTAD F\u03bcASQTAD\n\n(29)\n\nin the quark action, for example, smears all links but\ndoes not introduce new tree-level a2 errors.\nThe second problem with multiple smearings is that\nthey replace a single link in the naive action by a sum of\na very large number of products of links. This explosion\nin the number of terms does not affect single-gluon\nver\u221a\ntices on quark lines, by design, but leads to a N -growth\nin the size of two-gluon vertices where N is the number\n\n\u221a\nof terms in the sum. The N -growth enhances one-loop\ndiagrams with two-gluon vertices, canceling much of the\nbenefit obtained from smearing. This problem is remedied by reunitarizing the smeared link operator: that is\nwe replace\nF\u03bcASQTAD \u2192 F\u03bcASQTAD U F\u03bcASQTAD\n\n(30)\n\nwhere operator U unitarizes whatever it acts on. A\nsmeared link that has been unitarized\n\u221a is bounded (by\nunity) and so cannot suffer from the N problem. Although we verified that it is unnecessary to make the\nunitarized link into an SU (3) matrix - simple unitarization is adequate - the results given in this paper use links\nthat are projected back onto SU (3). Reunitarizing has\nno effect on the single-gluon vertex, and therefore does\nnot introduce new O(a2 ) errors.\nThe doubly smeared operator is simplified if we rearrange it as follows\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX a2 (\u03b4\u03c1 )2\n\uf8f8 U F\u03bc ,\nF\u03bcHISQ \u2261 \uf8edF\u03bc \u2212\n(31)\n2\n\u03c16=\u03bc\n\nwhere the entire correction for a2 errors is moved to the\noutermost smearing.

(28)) for three different light-quark actions and massless\nquarks. Terms not listed have zero coefficient in this order.\nResults are given for the unimproved (Wilson) gluon action,\nand, in the ASQTAD case, also for the standard L\u00fcscherWeisz action. Results for the average coefficient are also given,\nas are the splittings \u2206m2\u03c0 between the 3-link pion and the\nGoldstone pion. The pion masses are from simulations with\nuncorrected gluons at 1/a \u2248 1/10 fm with no vacuum polarization.\n\nwhile in the second,\nX\u03bc (x) \u2261 U F\u03bc U\u03bc (x).\n\nTo examine this issue, we recomputed the one-loop coefficients for all of the leading taste-exchange correction\nterms in the action (Eq. (28)) using the HISQ action,\nas well as the HYP action from [11]. The results are\nderived in Appendix F and presented in Table II. The\nHISQ coefficients are on average an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the ASQTAD coefficients. Consequently\nthe residual taste-exchange one-loop corrections in the\nHISQ action are probably smaller than two-loop corrections and possibly also dimension-8 taste-exchange operators at current lattice spacings. The HYP action gives\ncoefficients similar in size to HISQ.\n\n(35)\n\nThe third problem with smearing is that previous work\nhas only demonstrated its impact on the mass splittings\nbetween pions with different tastes. For small masses,\nthere are only five degenerate multiplets of pion. Consequently showing that smearing reduces the splittings\nbetween the pion multiplets does not guarantee that all\n28 taste-exchange terms in the quark action (Eq. (28))\nare suppressed; and, therefore, it does not guarantee that\ntaste-exchange effects are generally suppressed (other\nthan in the pion mass splittings).\n\nc Quarks\n\nMany new taste-preserving operators would need to\nbe added to the HISQ action in order to remove all order \u03b1s a2 errors. The leading operators are listed in Table III. None of these is relevant at the few percent level\nfor light quarks, but terms that enter in relative order\n\u03b1s (amc )2 might change answers by as much as 5\u201310%\nfor c quarks on current lattices, where amc \u2248 0.5 and\n\u03b1s \u2248 1/3. High-precision work requires that these errors\nbe removed.\nNonrelativistic expansions of the various operators in\nTable III show that only the first, the Naik term, can\ncause errors in order \u03b1s (amc )2 . All of the others result\nin harmless renormalizations or are suppressed by additional powers of v/c, and so contribute only at the level\nof 2\u20133% or less for \u03c8s and less than 1% for Ds. We can\nremove all \u03b1s (amc )2 errors by including radiative corrections in the \u01eb parameter that multiplies the Naik term\n(Eq. (19)).\nThere are two ways to compute the radiative correction\nto \u01eb. One is nonperturbative: \u01eb is adjusted until the\nrelativistic dispersion relation,\nc2 (p) \u2261\n\nE 2 (p) \u2212 m2\n= 1,\np2\n\n(36)\n\ncomputed in a meson simulation is valid for all low threemomenta p.\nA simpler procedure is to compute the one-loop correction to \u01eb using perturbation theory - by requiring, for\nexample, the correct dispersion relation for a quark in\none-loop order. The result would have the form\n\u01eb = \u01eb1 \u03b1s \u2212\n\n27\n(am)2 + O(\u03b12s , (am)4 )\n40\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u01eb1 depends upon (am)2 . As we will show, \u01eb1 turns\nout to be negligibly small for the HISQ action (but not\nfor ASQTAD).\n\n\f9\nOperator\na2 \u03c8D\u03bc3 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8\na2 m\u03c8\u03c3 * gF \u03c8\na2 \u03c8D2 D * \u03b3\u03c8\na2 \u03c8(D * \u03b3)3 \u03c8\na2 m\u03c8D2 \u03c8\n2\na \u03c8\u03c3 * gF D * \u03b3\u03c8\na2 \u03c8D * gF * \u03b3\u03c8\na2 (\u03c8\u03b3\u03c8)2\na2 (\u03c8\u03b3\u03b35 \u03c8)2\n\n\u03c8 Physics\n\u03b1s (am)2\n\u03b1s (v/c)2 (am)2\n\nD Physics\n\u03b1s (am)2\n\u03b1s (v/c)(am)2\n\n\u03b1s (v/c)2 (am)2\n\n\u03b1s (v/c)2 (am)2\n\nTABLE III: Relative errors associated with the leading (for\ncharm quarks) taste-preserving operators that enter the HISQ\naction in one-loop order.

The errors listed are relative to the binding\nenergy which is of order 500 MeV for both \u03c8s and Ds. Some\nof the operators are related to others in the same grouping by\nthe equations of motion, and so are redundant.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATIONS: BOUNDING TASTE\nEXCHANGE\n\nWe tested our perturbative analysis of the suppression\nof taste exchange by computing the pion mass taste splittings for ASQTAD, HISQ, and a few other variations [21].\nSome of these results are shown in Table II where we list\nthe mass splitting \u2206m2\u03c0 between the 3-link pions and\nthe 0-link (Goldstone) pion from a quenched simulation\nwith unimproved (Wilson) glue at a = 1/10 fm and quark\nmass am = 0.03 [13]. As expected, small mass splittings\nare correlated with small values for the coefficients of the\none-loop taste-exchange interactions (Eq. (28)). These\nresults confirm: a) that taste-exchange interactions are\nperturbative in origin; b) that these interactions will be\nsuppressed by a factor of order \u03b1s \u2248 1/3 in the HISQ\naction relative to the ASQTAD action at current lattice\nspacings; and c) the HISQ action will be more accurate\nthan other current competitors because it has negligible\none-loop taste exchange and no tree-level O(a2 ) errors.\nWe have also compared meson splittings for ASQTAD and HISQ valence quarks in full QCD simulations with nf = 3 light-quark (ASQTAD) vacuum polarization. We find that the pseudoscalar splittings are\n3.6(5) times smaller with HISQ than with ASQTAD on\nlattices with a = 1/8 fm, when both valence quarks are\ns quarks. The splittings are 3.1(7) times smaller on our\n1/11 fm lattices.\nAny taste-exchange effect will be 3\u20134 times smaller in\nHISQ, and so measuring the ASQTAD\u2013HISQ difference\nin any quantity allows us to bound taste-exchange errors\nin each formalism. To illustrate how such comparisons\nare done, we have computed the mass of the \u03c6 meson\nand the pseudovector decay constant f\u03b7s of the \u03b7s meson\nusing ASQTAD and HISQ valence quarks for each of our\ntwo lattice spacings.\n\nThe \u03c6 is unstable and so its mass in a simulation is sensitive to the volume of the lattice (it is not \"gold-plated\"\nin the sense of [1]). We have not corrected for this volume dependence, but have simulated using a fixed physical volume. Consequently results for the mass should\nextrapolate to the same value as a \u2192 0, but this value\nmay be a few tens of MeV larger than the physical mass.\nThe \u03b7s is an easy-to-analyze substitute for a \u03c0; it is a\n0\u2212+ ss meson, but without valence-quark annihilation,\nand therefore hypothetical. We tuned the s mass so that\nthe \u03b7s masses in each case were all identical (696 MeV)\nto within \u00b11 MeV (statistical/fitting errors only). We\nevaluated the \u03b7s decay constant by computing the matrix element of the pseudoscalar density and multiplying\nby the bare quark mass (see [2], for example).\nOur results, shown in Table IV, suggest significant\ntaste-exchange errors for ASQTAD, particularly in the\n1/8 fm simulation. Looking first at the decay constant f\u03b7s , the ASQTAD result on the coarse lattice\nis 6(3)% larger than the ASQTAD result on the fine lattice, where taste-exchange effects should be at least a\nfactor of two smaller. The uncertainty in the discrepancy is large here because of uncertainties in the values of the lattice spacings. Far more compelling is the\n4.6(6)% discrepancy between ASQTAD and HISQ on the\ncoarse lattice, which can be measured far more accurately\nthan differences between simulations with different lattice spacings. This discrepancy is reduced to 1.9(4)%\non the fine lattice, as expected since a2 is half as large.\nSince errors in HISQ should be 3\u20134 times smaller than in\nASQTAD, these discrepancies imply that taste-exchange\nerrors in the decay constant could be as large as 5\u20136%\nfor ASQTAD but only 1\u20132% for HISQ when a = 1/8 fm.\nThe errors are half that size when a = 1/11 fm. Results\nfrom both formalisms are consistent with an extrapolated\nvalue of 180 (4) MeV.\nResults for the \u03c6 mass are very similar. These give a final mass of 1.05(2) GeV, which is 30(20) MeV above the\nmass 1.019 GeV from experiment (and consistent with\nexpectations for finite-volume effects). These analyses\ntaken together indicate that HISQ is delivering 1\u20132% precision already on the coarse lattice, while a significantly\nsmaller lattice spacing (and much more costly simulation)\nis needed to achieve similar precision from ASQTAD.\nHISQ a2 errors should be less than 1% on the 1/11 fm\nlattice for light quarks.\nOur tests are only partial because ASQTAD quarks\nwere used for the vacuum polarization in both the HISQ\nand ASQTAD analyses, but the effects of changes in\nthe vacuum polarization are typically 3\u20135 times smaller\nthan the effects caused by the same changes in the valence quarks. The agreement between our HISQ results\nfrom different lattice spacings indicates that finite-a errors from the vacuum polarization are not large for these\nlattice spacings.\nIn past work, taste-exchange errors have been estimated by comparing results from different lattice spacings, relying upon the fact that these errors vanish as\n\n\f10\n\nf\u03b7s\n\na (fm) ASQTAD\n(MeV) 1/8\n196(4)\n1/11\n185(3)\n\nm\u03c6 (GeV)\n\nHISQ\n187(4)\n182(3)\n\n1/8 1.119(24) 1.076(23)\n1/11 1.057(18) 1.052(16)\n\nASQTAD/HISQ\n1.046 (6)\n1.019 (4)\n1.040(9)\n1.005(6)\n\nTABLE IV: Simulation results for decay constant f\u03b7s and\n\u03c6 mass using either ASQTAD or HISQ for the valence quarks\nfrom full QCD simulations (with nf = 3 ASQTAD quarks).\nLattice spacing errors cancel in the ratio ASQTAD to HISQ\ncomputed on the same gluon configurations; thus errors are\nmuch smaller for the ratio.\n\na \u2192 0. This example illustrates how the same errors can\nbe reliably estimated by comparing ASQTAD with HISQ\nresults from simulations using only a single lattice spacing. This approach to estimating taste-exchange errors\nis very efficient. It is almost certainly the simplest way\nto quantify uncertainties about taste exchange and the\nvalidity of the 1/16-root trick for vacuum polarization.\n\nV.\n\nAPPLICATIONS: c QUARKS AND\nCHARMONIUM\n\nAs argued in Sections II C and III B, we expect the\nASQTAD action and, especially, the HISQ action to work\nwell for c quarks even though amc is typically of order\n0.4 or larger on current lattices. To achieve high precision (few percent or better), we must tune the Naik\nterm's renormalization parameter \u01eb (Eq. (19)). Here we\ndo this nonperturbatively by computing the speed of light\nsquared, c2 (p) (Eq. (18)), for the \u03b7c in simulations with\nvarious values of \u01eb and tuning \u01eb until c2 = 1. Our results\nare summarized in Table V.\nThe ASQTAD results on the fine lattices show only\nsmall errors in c2 even with \u01eb = 0. Values for different\n\u01ebs are plotted in Fig. 4, together with an interpolating\ncurve. These data indicate that the optimal choice is \u01eb =\n0.19(5) for this lattice spacing and mass. The tree-level\nprediction for \u01eb, from Eq. (20), is \u22120.10, which indicates\nthat radiative corrections in \u01eb are of order 1 \u00d7 \u03b1s \u2248 0.3,\nas expected.\nThe HISQ results show even smaller c2 errors on the\nfine lattices. Tuning to \u01eb = \u22120.1155, the tree-level value\ngiven by Eq. (20) for amc = 0.43, removes all errors\nin c2 at the level of 1%. This suggests that one-loop\nand higher-order radiative corrections in \u01eb are negligible for HISQ compared with the tree-level corrections.\nThe dominance of tree-level contributions is confirmed\nby our HISQ analysis using the coarser lattice spacing,\nwhere amc \u2248 0.66. Here, we found the optimal value\n\u01eb = \u22120.22(3) again by tuning \u01eb until c2 = 1 for a lowmomentum \u03b7c . (We overshot slightly and did simulations\nfor \u01eb = \u22120.21 rather than \u22120.22.)

Results are given for different values of\nthe Naik term's renormalization parameter \u01eb (Eq. (19)), the\nlattice spacings a, and the meson's three-momenta p (in units\nof the smallest momentum on the lattice which was roughly\n0.5 GeV in each case).\n\nEq. (20). Consequently it is quite likely that the treelevel formula is sufficiently accurate for most practical\napplications today.\nNote that setting \u01eb = \u22121 cancels out the Naik term\ncompletely. Tree-level errors are then order a2 rather\nthan order a4 , as in the HISQ action. Table V shows\nthat these a2 errors cause c2 to be off by almost a factor\nof 2. This example underscores the importance of using\na2 -improved actions in high-precision work.\nOn the coarse lattice, we use the c2 (p) with p = pmin ,\nthe smallest nonzero momentum on our lattice, to tune \u01eb.\nIt is important to verify that the tuned action gives the\ncorrect dispersion relation for other momenta as well.\nThe data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that errors are less than\na couple percent for meson momenta out to 1 GeV even\non the coarse lattice where amc = 0.66. Indeed, the errors would probably have been smaller (< 1%) had we\ntuned \u01eb a little more accurately.\nWe examined the spectrum of the \u03c8 meson family to\nfurther test the precision of our formalism. We used the\n1/11 fm lattices where amc \u2248 0.4, and therefore we expect errors of order 1\u20132% of the binding energy, or 5\u2013\n10 MeV (see Section III B). A particularly sensitive test\nis the hyperfine mass splitting between the \u03c8 and \u03b7c . We\ntuned the bare c mass until the mass of the local (and\nlightest) \u03b7c in our simulation agreed with experiment.\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 4: The speed of light squared, c2 (p), computed for an\n\u03b7c meson using the ASQTAD action with p = (pmin , pmin , 0)\nand different Naik-term renormalizations \u01eb, where pmin is the\nsmallest lattice momentum possible (approximately 500 MeV\nhere). The correct value, \u01eb = 0.19(5), occurs at the intersection of the interpolating line with the line c2 = 1, as shown.\nHere amc = .38.\n\nother than pseudoscalars are much less sensitive to tasteexchange effects.\nThe \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b7c hyperfine splitting, for 0-link mesons in\neach case, is 109(3) MeV in our 1/11 fm simulation with\ntuned \u01eb (= \u22120.115). The 3% uncertainty is almost entirely due to tuning uncertainties in the lattice spacings\nsince these uncertainties enter twice: once for converting the splitting from lattice to physical units, and once\nthrough uncertainties in the c mass, which are themselves\ncontrolled by uncertainties in a\u22121 [12]. Our HISQ result\nis somewhat smaller than the current experimental result\nof 117(1) MeV [23], but it needs three further corrections.\n(It is also worth noting that the current Particle Data\nGroup average of 117 MeV is somewhat larger than the\nmost recent experiments which find values in the range\n113\u2013115 MeV with uncertainties of 1\u20132 MeV; see [23].)\nThe first correction comes from the operators in Table III that must be added to the HISQ lagrangian in\norder to remove further discretization errors. Of these\nthe most important for the hyperfine splitting is\n\u03b4Lhfs = chfs a2 mc \u03c8\u03c3 * F \u03c8\n\nFIG. 5: The speed of light squared, c2 (p2 ), for \u03b7c mesons\nat different momenta on a lattice where amc \u2248 0.66 for the\nHISQ action with \u01eb = \u22120.21. A comparison with other results\nfrom Table V suggests that choosing \u01eb = \u22120.22 would move\nall points down onto the line c2 = 1 to within errors.\n\nSince there are no other free parameters in our action,\nthe simulation then predicts a mass for the \u03c8. As is\nclear from Fig. 6, the \u03c8 mass in the simulation is quite\naccurate - certainly within the 5\u201310 MeV we expected.\nThe data shown in this last figure also bound tasteexchange errors. As shown there, different tastes of the \u03b7c\nhave different masses, because of taste-exchange interactions. The maximum spread in the masses for the HISQ\naction, however, is only 9 MeV. This is much smaller than\nthe spread from the ASQTAD action, where the splitting between, for example, the 0-link and 1-temporallink pion masses is 40 MeV (compared to only 3 MeV for\nthe same splitting with HISQ). (Uncorrected staggered\nquarks also show very large splittings [22].) Note also\nthat the spread in the \u03c8s is three times smaller than the\nspread in the \u03b7c s. This is typical; the masses of mesons\n\n(38)\n\nwhere chfs = O(\u03b1s ). This will affect the hyperfine splitting in relative order \u03b1s (amc )2 , or at the level of \u00b15 MeV.\nThe coefficient chfs is readily computed in perturbation\ntheory and this calculation is underway.\nThe second correction comes from residual tasteexchange interactions, which from the data in Fig. 6\ncould be of order a few MeV. Both this error and that\ncorrected by \u03b4Lhfs are approximately proportional to a2 .\nSo we can estimate them (together) by comparing to a\ncalculation with a different lattice spacing. We repeated\nour hyperfine splitting analysis on the 1/8 fm lattice using the tuned \u01eb (= \u2212.21). The a2 errors should be a little\nmore than twice as large on the coarser lattice since a2\nis almost exactly twice as large. We obtained a splitting\nof 110(3) MeV on the coarse lattice, which is essentially\nidentical to the 109(3) MeV we obtained on the fine lattice. Combining these results, together with our a priori\nexpectation of \u00b15 MeV errors from a2 corrections, we obtain an a2 corrected hyperfine splitting is 109(5) MeV.\nThe third correction is due to the fact that our simulation does not include effects from the annihilation of the\nvalence cc quarks into two or more gluons. Such annihilations are responsible for small shifts in the \u03b7c and \u03c8\nmasses, as well as for the (non-electromagnetic) hadronic\ndecay rate of each meson. The dominant contribution\ncomes from cc \u2192 gg and affects only the \u03b7c . The shift in\nthe \u03b7c energy is proportional to the perturbative amplitude for cc \u2192 gg \u2192 cc at threshold [24] and therefore [25]\n\u2206E\u03b7c \u2212i \u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 hadrons)/2\n\u03c0\n\u221d ln(2) \u2212 1 \u2212 i + O(\u03b1s ).\n2\n\n(39)\n\nThis result implies that the leading correction to the \u03b7c\nmass due to cc annihilation can be computed from the\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 6: Masses for different tastes of the \u03b7c and \u03c8 using\nHISQ and ASQTAD c quarks with \u01eb = 0 on a 1/11 fm lattice\n(amc \u2248 0.4). For HISQ, \u03b7c s are given (from left to right)\nfor the 0, 1, 2, and 3 spatial link tastes, without and then\nwith a temporal link; only the spatial splittings are given\nfor the \u03c8. For ASQTAD, \u03b7c results are given for only the\n0-link and 1-temporal-link operators, and \u03c8 results for only\nthe 0-link operator. The dashed lines indicate the results\nfrom experiment. Error bars are of order the size of the plot\nsymbols.\nFIG. 7: Masses for different excitations of the \u03c8 meson from\na simulation at lattice spacing 1/11 fm.

This correction increases our theoretical value for the \u03c8\u2013\u03b7c splitting\nto 111(5) MeV, which agrees well with experiment. The\nsea-quark masses in our simulations are not quite correct, but both theoretical expectations and experience\nwith previous simulations indicate that this has negligible effect on this hyperfine splitting.\nThis level of precision would be impossible using our\nASQTAD results because the taste-exchange errors are\ntens of MeV - much larger than the \u00b15 MeV expected\nfrom other a2 errors. This example confirms that tasteexchange errors are likely the dominant source of a2 errors in the ASQTAD formalism. With HISQ, on the\nother hand, taste-exchange errors have been suppressed\nto a level commensurate with other errors.\nFinally we also computed the masses of some radially\nand orbitally excited states in the \u03c8 family using HISQ,\nalthough not as accurately as the ground-state masses.\nHigh-precision determinations of excited-state masses require careful design of the meson sources and sinks used\nin the simulation. Here we did not attempt high precision, but rather used simple local sources to do a quick\ncheck on the spectrum. Our results, shown in Fig. 7,\nagree well with experiment to within our statistical errors.\n\nVI. SIMULATION TECHNIQUES FOR\nHIGHLY-SMEARED OPERATORS\n\nIt would be highly desirable to create new unquenched\ngluon configurations using the HISQ action in place of the\nASQTAD action. The use of such configurations, with\nlattice spacings of order a = 0.1 fm, would significantly\nreduce any residual worries about errors due to tasteexchange interactions.\nSuch simulations are complicated, however, by the\nheavily smeared, reunitarized links in the action. The\nadditional smearing and reunitarization have no effect\non the cost of the quark-matrix inversions required when\nupdating gluon configurations, but they complicate calculation of the derivative Da (x, \u03bc) Sq of the quark action Sq [U ] with respect to an individual link operator U\u03bc (x). Derivative Da (x, \u03bc) is defined by\nf (ei\u01eb\n\na\n\nTa\n\nU\u03bc (x)) \u2261 f (U\u03bc (x)) + \u01eba Da (x, \u03bc)f (U\u03bc ) + O(\u01eb2 )\n(41)\nfor any function f of U\u03bc (x). We developed and tested\nboth an analytic and a stochastic version of the derivative\nfor this action [26].\nThe analytic version employs a unitary projection\n1\n\nV \u2192 (V V \u2020 )\u2212 2 V\n\n(42)\n\nto reunitarize each smeared link V . The main obstacle is\nthen computation of the gauge derivative of the inverse\nsquare root. Using the product-rule identity for the ma-\n\n\f13\ntrix M \u2261 V V \u2020 ,\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nM 2 DM \u2212 2 + DM \u2212 2 M 2 = \u2212M \u2212 2 (DM ) M \u2212 2 ,\n(43)\n1\nwe can solve for D(V V \u2020 )\u2212 2 directly, both iteratively by\nthe conjugate gradient algorithm, and exactly by first\ndiagonalizing V V \u2020 .\n1\nUsing the chain rule, we combine D(V V \u2020 )\u2212 2 with\nstandard derivatives of the base action and of the\nsmeared links V . We encode derivatives of the action and\nsmeared links generically, allowing for run-time changes\nindependently in either. The additional cost of comput1\ning and combining D(V V \u2020 )\u2212 2 with these is minimal.\nSeveral other analytic approaches have been developed\nfor unitarized smearings [27, 28]. The authors of [27]\naddressed the problem of computing the derivative of the\nmatrix inverse square root by replacing it with a rational\napproximation. In [28], the smearing itself is unitary,\nexplicitly avoiding the need to reunitarize and the inverse\nsquare root. In both, the derivatives are then computed\nstraightforwardly.\nIn the stochastic approach, we define links\nU\u03bc\u03b7 (x) \u2261 ei\u01eb\u03b7(x,\u03bc) U\u03bc (x)\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03b7(x, \u03bc) is now a field of traceless, hermitian 3 \u00d7 3\nrandom matrices, each with normalization\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(45)\nh\u03b7ij \u03b7lm i\u03b7 = \u03b4im \u03b4jl \u2212 \u03b4ij \u03b4lm ,\n3\nand \u01eb is a very small number. Defining \u2206Sq (x, \u03bc) to\nbe the terms in Sq [U \u03b7 ] \u2212 Sq [U ] containing U\u03bc (x), the\nderivative can be computed efficiently from\n2\u01ebT aDa (x, \u03bc) Sq \u2248 h\u03b7(x, \u03bc) \u2206Sq (x, \u03bc)i\u03b7\n\n(46)\n\naveraged over a finite number of sets of random \u03b7s. Our\nnumerical experiments suggest that 10\u2013100 sets of \u03b7s are\nadequate for actions like HISQ. We will describe both our\nstochastic and analytic techniques in a later paper.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have demonstrated that tasteexchange interactions are perturbative and we have\nshown how to use Symanzik improvement to create a\nnew staggered-quark action (HISQ) that has greatly reduced one-loop taste-exchange errors, no tree-level order a2 errors, and no tree-level order (am)4 errors to\nleading order in the quark's velocity v/c. The HISQ action addresses one of the fundamental issues surrounding staggered-quark simulations by allowing us to estimate taste-exchange interactions through comparisons of\nHISQ with ASQTAD results. We presented numerical\nevidence that taste-exchange interactions in HISQ contribute less than 1% to light-quark quantities, like meson\n\nFIG. 8: Masses for two different tastes of the Ds and one\nfor the Ds\u2217 using HISQ c quarks on lattices with lattice spacings a = 1/8 fm (\u01eb = \u22120.21) and 1/11 fm (\u01eb = \u22120.115). For\nHISQ, Ds s are given (from left to right) for the 0-link and\n1-temporal-link mesons; only the 0-link splitting is given for\nthe Ds\u2217 . The dashed lines indicate the results from experiment. The error bars shown are from the simulated values for\nmDs \u2212 m\u03b7c /2 and mDs\u2217 \u2212 m\u03b7c /2, since these quantities are\ninsensitive to the c mass and the c mass was tuned to make\nthe simulated value for m\u03b7c exact.\n\nmasses and decay constants, at lattice spacings as large\nas 0.1 fm.\nThe suppression of all order (am)4 errors by powers\nof (v/c)2 makes HISQ the most accurate discretization\nof the quark action for simulating c quarks on current\nlattices. We demonstrated this with a new lattice QCD\ndetermination of the \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b7c mass splitting, which agrees\nwell with experiment. This result could be improved\nby computing the coefficient chfs in the correction \u03b4Lhfs\n(Eq. (38)) to the HISQ action.\nOur final HISQ action is defined by Eqs. (32\u201335). We\nshowed that the tree-level value (Eq. (20)) for the Naikterm parameter \u01eb is adequate at the level of 1% errors for\nlattice spacings at least as large as 1/8 fm.\nThe HISQ formalism will be most useful for D physics\nand works very well for such mesons. In Fig. 8, for example, we show the Ds\u2217 \u2013Ds spin splitting from simulations\nwith HISQ c quarks using both our 1/8 fm and 1/11 fm\nlattices. As in the charmonium case, theory and experiment agree well here to within errors. Another very sensitive test of our simulations is to compare computed and\nexperimental values for the mass difference 2mDs \u2212 m\u03b7c ,\nwhich is quite insensitive to tuning errors in the c mass.\nWe obtain 956(14) MeV using HISQ on the 1/11 fm lattice, and 978(20) MeV on the 1/8 fm lattice. Both values agree well with the splitting 956(1) MeV from experiment. Finally, we measured the speed of light and found\nc2 = 1.00(4) for the Ds on the coarse lattice (a = 1/8 fm\nwith \u01eb = \u22120.21), confirming that the same coupling constant values work for both Ds and \u03b7c mesons. It is important to appreciate that there are no free parameters available for tuning in the extraction of any of these results;\nall QCD parameters were tuned using other quantities.\nAs we will discuss in a later paper, the HISQ formalism\nis particularly useful for accurate calculations of quanti-\n\n\f14\nties like fD , fDs , D \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd, and so on. These all require\ncurrents and these currents, even though they are conserved or partially conserved, have order \u03b1s (am)2 renormalizations. Consider, for example, cc annihilation into\na (virtual) photon. The electromagnetic current can be\ncomputed by inserting photon link operators,\n!\nZ x+\u03bc\u0302\nQED\nQED\n,\n(47)\nU\u03bc\n\u2261 exp \u2212ieq\ndx * A\nx\n\ninto the HISQ action and then expanding to first order\nin AQED to obtain\n\u2212ieq AQED\n\u03bc\n\nJ\u03bcQED .\n\n+ c2 \u03b1s a2 \u03c8 (D * eF )QED * \u03b3 \u03c8,\n\n(49)\n\njust as for the gluon fields. The first correction term\nrenormalizes the quark's magnetic moment, the second\nits charge radius. Such terms are normally negligible\nsince the extra derivatives introduce extra powers of (ap)2\nand p is small. For c quark annihilations, however, the\nextra derivatives become c quark masses instead of small\nmomenta, and so are more important. It is easy to compute coefficients c1 and c2 in perturbation theory, but\ncontributions to annihilation from these operators are indistinguishable from those coming from the leading operator J QED . Consequently we can omit the corrections\nand, instead, introduce a renormalization constant for\nJ QED :\nJ\u03bcQED,continuum = Zeff J\u03bcQED,HISQ\n\nAPPENDIX A: GAMMA MATRICES\n\nThe complete set of spinor matrices can be labeled by\na four-component vector n\u03bc consisting of 0s and 1s (i.e.,\nn\u03bc \u2208 Z2 ):\n\u03b3n \u2261\n\n(48)\n\nCurrent J QED is not renormalized, because of QED's\ngauge symmetry, but it is not the only operator that contributes to cc annihilation.

The calculations were\ncarried out on computer clusters at Scotgrid and QCDOCX; we thank David Martin and EPCC for assistance.\n\n(50)\n\n(51)\n\nThe situation is very similar for (partially-conserved)\nweak-interaction currents.\nAgain the current derived from the action requires O(\u03b1s (am)2 ) corrections.\nOnce these one-loop corrections have been calculated\nand included, however, the remaining terms are only\nO(\u03b12s (am)2 ). Consequently one-loop radiative corrections are all that is necessary to achieve 1\u20132% precision for fD , D \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd, and similar quantities. Other\ndiscretization errors in these quantities should be of order 1% or less.

Staggering is an important optimization in simulations; it is\nalso a remarkable property.

Note that\n\u03a9(x) = \u03b3n\n\nfor n\u03bc = x\u03bc mod 2;\n\n(B3)\n\nthere are only 16 different \u03a9s.

It says that the spinor structure of the naive-quark propagator is completely independent of the gauge field. This is certainly not the case\nfor individual tastes of naive quark, whose spins will flip\nback and forth as they scatter off fluctuations in the chromomagnetic field, for example. The sixteen tastes of the\nnaive quark field are packaged in such a way, however,\nthat all gauge-field dependence vanishes in the spinor\nstructure.\nDoubling symmetry is immediately evident in the staggered action, Eq. (B6), since the action is invariant under\n\u03c7(x) \u2192 B\u03b6 (0) \u03c7(x),\n\n(B9)\n\nwhich merely scrambles the (equivalent) spinor components of \u03c7(x), and since\n(B10)\n\nIn simulations one generally discards all but one spinor\ncomponent of \u03c7(x), resulting in highly efficient algorithms. The Symanzik improvements discussed above are\ntrivially incorporated.\nNote, finally, that Eq. (B10) implies\nB\u03b6 (x) \u03a9(x)\u03a9\u2020 (y) B\u03b6\u2020 (y) = \u03a9(x)\u03a9\u2020 (y).\n\n(B11)\n\nSF (x, y) = B\u03b6 (x) SF (x, y) B\u03b6\u2020 (y)\n\n(B12)\n\nfor any background gauge field.

This last relation, which is easily\nchecked at tree level (but true to all orders in \u03b1s ), shows\nthat there is only one sixteenth as much information in\nthe naive-quark propagator as naively expected.\n\n(B4)\n(B5)\n\nx<\n\u03bc\n\nwhere\n\u2261 x0 + x1 + * * * + x\u03bc\u22121 (see Appendix A).\nTherefore the naive-quark action can be rewritten\n\u03c8(x)(\u03b3 * \u2206 + m)\u03c8(x) = \u03c7(x)(\u03b1(x) * \u2206 + m)\u03c7(x). (B6)\nRemarkably the \u03c7 action is diagonal in spinor space; each\ncomponent of \u03c7 is exactly equivalent to every other component.

STAGGERED\n\nThe quark field \u03c8(x) will typically contain contributions from all 16 tastes. One can separate out (approximately) the different tastes by blocking the field on hypercubes that have two sites per side. One way to project\nout the \u03b6 = 0 taste, for example, is to average over the\nhypercube:\n1 X\n\u03c8B =\n\u03c8(xB + \u03b4x)\n(C1)\n16\n\u03b4x\u03bc \u2208Z2\n\n\f16\nwhere xB , with xB\u03bc mod 2 = 0, identifies the hypercube,\nand the sum is over all 16 sites in the hypercube. Any\ncomponent of \u03c8(x) that has momentum p \u2248 \u03b6\u03c0 with\n\u03b6 6= 0 will be strongly suppressed by the average. (The\nsuppression is O(a2 p2 ) for a mode with momentum p +\n\u03b6\u03c0.) A \u03b6 6= 0 piece of \u03c8(x) can be isolated by applying\na doubling operator B\u03b6 to transform that component to\n\u03b6 = 0, and then, again, averaging over the hypercube to\nisolate that component:\n1 X\n(\u03b6)\nB\u03b6 (xB + \u03b4x) \u03c8(xB + \u03b4x).\n(C2)\n\u03c8B =\n16\n\u03b4x\u03bc \u2208Z2\n\n(\u03b6)\n\u03c8B ,\n\nwith one for each \u03b6, describe\nThe 16 blocked fields\nthe 16 different tastes of quark, each now in the low momentum sector (i.e., with p\u03bc \u2264 \u03c0/2).\nWith staggered quarks, one keeps only one component\nof \u03c7(x) since the components are equivalent and decouple:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03c71 (x)\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\u03c7(x) \u2192 \uf8ef\n(C3)\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8f0 0 \uf8fb\n0\n\nWe can use our hypercube blocking (Eq.

Consequently we can\nreconstruct just four tastes, t = 1 . . . 4, of blocked quark\nfrom a single staggered field:\nX\n(t)\n\u03c8\u0303B =\n\u03a9(\u03b4x) \u03c7\u0302(t) \u03c71 (xB + \u03b4x)\n(C6)\n\u03b4x\n\n(t)\n\nwhere the \u03c7\u0302(t) are unit spinors with \u03c7\u0302i = \u03b4i,t .\nThis last formula defines the standard taste basis for\nstaggered quarks. It is of more use conceptually than\npractically, and we will not need it in what follows.\n\nFormula (C4) shows that some \u03b6's become indistinguishable in the staggered approximation. In fact, by\nexplicit calculation (given our specific representation of\nthe \u03b3 matrices), one finds that the \u03b6s fall into four equivalence classes composed of indistinguishable \u03b6s:\nA:\nB:\nC:\nD:\n\n0000\n0010\n1000\n1010\n\n0001\n0011\n1001\n1011\n\n0110\n0100\n1110\n1100\n\n0111\n0101\n1111\n1101\n\n(C7)\n\nThese four classes correspond to the four tastes of staggered quark; all the \u03b6s in a single class give the same\n(t)\nstaggered-quark field \u03c8\u0303B (Eq. (C6)) from Eq. (C4).\nThe equivalence of the \u03b6s within a single class is preserved under addition of \u03b6s: for example, adding any two\n\u03b6s from class B always gives a \u03b6 in class A, while adding\nany vector from class B to any vector from class C always gives a vector in class D. The full addition table\nfor these classes is:\n+\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\nA\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\nB\nB\nA\nD\nC\n\nC\nC\nD\nA\nB\n\nD\nD\nC\nB\nA\n\nThis kind of structure is necessary for the four-fold reduction in the number of tastes due to staggering - that\nis, 16 tastes of naive quark are reduced to 4 tastes of staggered quark because we can consistently identify certain\ncorners of the Brillouin zone with each other in the staggered case.\n\nAPPENDIX D: NAIVE-QUARK CURRENTS\n\nNaive quarks lead to huge numbers of nearly equivalent\nmesons. Where in ordinary QCD one might consider a\nsingle meson operator, Jn = \u03c8\u03b3n \u03c8, one has 16 point-split\noperators in the naive theory each of which couples to a\ndifferent meson:\nJn(s) (x) \u2261 \u03c8(x) \u03b3n(s) \u03c8(x)\n\u2261 \u03c8(x) \u03b3n \u03c8(x + \u03b4xsn )\n\u221d \u03c7(x) \u03b3s \u03c7(x + \u03b4xsn ),\n\n(D1)\n\nwhere s is any one of the 16 four-vectors consisting of 0s\nand 1s only,\n\u03b4xsn \u2261 (s + n) mod 2,\n\n(D2)\n\nand link operators U\u03bc are implicit (and a = 1 still). Each\nof these operators creates a different version of the Jn meson; they are orthogonal. This is because\nJn(s) \u2192 (\u22121)s\u03bc Jn(s)\n\n(D3)\n\n\f17\n(\u03b6,s)\n\nunder a doubling transformation where\n\u03c8(x) \u2192 B\u03b6=\u03bc\u0302 (x) \u03c8(x)\n\n\u03c8(x) \u2192 \u03c8(x)B\u03bc\u0302\u2020 (x).\n\n(D4)\n\nThus the four-vector s determines the bilinear's transformation properties under arbitrary doubling transformations; it specifies the bilinear's \"signature\" under doubling transformations. Since doubling transformations\nare symmetries of the naive theory, the doubling signature is conserved: for example,\n(r) (s)\u2020\nh Jm\nJn i = 0\n\nif r 6= s,\n\n(D5)\n\nwhich proves that each of our point splittings creates a\ndifferent meson.\nDifferent signatures correspond to different variations\nof the same continuum meson, typically with slightly different masses, etc. These are the different tastes of the\nmeson. We label different tastes by the corresponding\nsignature s in the meson's rest frame.\nAdditional mesons are made by boosting particles into\nother corners of the Brillouin zone:\nptot \u2248 \u03b6\u03c0\n\n(D6)\n\nfor one of the sixteen \u03b6s. Such mesons would be highly\nrelativistic in the continuum, but here they are equivalent\nto low-energy mesons because of the doubling symmetry:\nfor example, the antiquark in the meson might carry a\nmomentum near zero, while the quark carries \u03b6\u03c0 but is\nthen equivalent to a zero-momentum quark state through\nthe doubling symmetry. Pushing such momenta through\na naive-quark bilinear, using for example\nX\nei ptot *x Jn(s) (x),\n(D7)\nx\n\nchanges the quantum numbers of the meson created by\nthe operator. To see this, consider current\nJn(\u03b6,s) (x) \u2261 (\u22121)\u03b6*x \u03c8(x) \u03b3 \u2020\u03b6 \u03b3n(s) \u03c8(x)\n= \u03c8(x) B\u03b6\u2020 (x) \u03b3n(s) \u03c8(x)\n\n(D8)\n\n\u221d \u03c7(x) \u03b3 \u2020\u03b6 \u03b3s \u03c7(x + \u03b4xsn )\n\n(D9)\n\nwhich has signature (\u03b6 + s) mod 2. This current obviously carries momentum ptot = \u03b6\u03c0 if averaged over all x.\nIt is easy to show that flavor-nonsinglet mesons created\n(\u03b6,s)\nby Jn\nwith different \u03b6s are all identical, and therefore\nall carry taste s. For a ud meson, for example, we can\nuse the separate doubling symmetries of the u and d to\nprove that\nh Jn(\u03b6,s) (x) Jn(\u03b6,s)\u2020 (y) i \u2261 h uB\u03b6\u2020 \u03b3n(s) d d\u03b3n(s) B\u03b6 u i\n= h u\u03b3n(s) d d\u03b3n(s) u i\n\u2261 h Jn(s) (x) Jn(s)\u2020 (y) i\nfor all \u03b6s.\n\n(D10)\n\nis intuitive (and therefore useThe labeling on Jn\nful) only if the current is averaged over x in such a way\nthat ptot = \u03b6\u03c0 + p where \u2212\u03c0/2 < p\u03bc \u2264 \u03c0/2 for all \u03bc;\nthe combination of all \u03b6s and ps covers all of momentum\nspace, so nothing is lost by this restriction and double\ncounting is avoided. We can enforce this restriction on\nthe momenta by redefining the current on a blocked lattice with one site at the center of every 24 hypercube\non the original lattice, just as we did for the quark field\n(Section C):\nX\n(\u03b6,s)\nJn(\u03b6,s) (xB + \u03b4x)\n(D11)\nJBn \u2261\n\u03b4x\u03bc \u2208Z2\n\nwhere xB identifies the hypercube (with xB\u03bc mod 2 =\n0). The blocked current creates a meson of taste s with\nmomentum in the \u03b6\u03c0 corner of the Brillouin zone.\nNote that momentum and taste conservation imply\nX\n\u2032 \u2032\nh Jn(\u03b6,s) (x) Jn(\u03b6 ,s )\u2020 (y) i = 0\n(D12)\nx,y\n\nunless \u03b6 = \u03b6 \u2032 and s = s\u2032 . Consequently the different\noperators are orthogonal when analyzed in momentum\nspace. Typically we sum over space, however, but not\ntime. In that case operators with the same signature,\nbut where \u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 = \u00b1t\u0302, can mix. This mixing leads to\ncomponents in meson propagators that oscillate in time,\nas we discuss below.\nTo summarize, there are 16 sets, each set labeled by\ntaste s, of 16 identical mesons, each meson labeled by \u03b6,\nfor each flavor-nonsinglet meson in the continuum. Each\ncorner \u03b6 of the Brillouin zone has a single representative\nof each taste of meson.\nFlavor-singlet mesons are slightly more complicated.\nIn a uu meson, for example, the quark and antiquark\nare created by the same field, and so do not have separate doubling transformations. Therefore the argument\n(\u03b6,s)\nrelating Jn s with different \u03b6s doesn't work. The only\ncontributions that spoil this argument are from annihilation, where the meson's quark and antiquark annihilate\ninto gluons. Annihilation gluons that contribute to, for\nexample,\nX\nh Jn(\u03b6,s) (x) Jn(\u03b6,s)\u2020 (0) i\n(D13)\n~\nx\n\ncarry total momentum \u03b6\u03c0 and so are far off-shell unless\n\u03b6 = 0. This has two implications: First, annihilation\ncontributions will be different for different \u03b6s. And, second, only the \u03b6 = 0 case has the correct coupling between\nthe flavor-singlet quarks and purely gluonic channels. In\nfact, only the taste-singlet state, among the \u03b6 = 0 states,\ncouples to the gluons since\nh Jn(s) (x) i\u03c8 \u221d Tr (\u03b3s )\n= 0\nunless s = 0.\n\n(D14)\n\nA similar condition applies to nonzero \u03b6s as well. For\neach \u03b6 there is only one taste that can couple to gluons. The gluons are highly virtual if \u03b6 is nonzero. These\n\n\f18\nlast contributions are taste-violating because they change\nquark taste along quark lines; they are removed by the\ncontact terms discussed in this paper.\nIt is not surprising that the flavor-singlet mesons are\nmore complicated. They usually have to be, particularly\nin the pseudoscalar channel where the U (1) problem must\nbe resolved. In our naive-quark theory, only the \u03b6 =\ns = 0 mesons couple properly to gluons. The masses\nof pseudoscalars with \u03b6 = s = 0 are shifted properly by\ninstantons in the chiral limit, so that the U (1) problem is\nresolved. The \u03b6 = s = 0 neutral pion is also the only pion\nthat decays to two photons. The corresponding axialvector current is only approximately conserved, even in\nthe chiral limit, so anomalies are not needed to mediate\nthe photon decay.\n\nwhere \u2295 adds vector n + s to x \"modulo\" the hypercube\nthat x lies in - that is,\n(x \u2295 n)\u03bc \u2261 xB\u03bc + (x\u03bc \u2212 xB\u03bc + n\u03bc ) mod 2\n\n(E5)\n\nwhen x is in the hypercube labeled by site xB (with\nxB\u03bc mod 2 = 0). Thus x \u2295 n is in the same hypercube\nas x. With this definition, we can redefine the staggeredquark current with spin n and taste s to be:\n\u03c8(x) \u03b3n \u2297 \u03bes \u03c8(x).\n\n(E6)\n\nThe \u2295 means that the new operators \u03b3n \u2297 \u03bes have a\nsimple algebra. If, for example,\n\u03c8\u0303(x) \u2261 \u03b3n \u2297 \u03bes \u03c8(x)\n\n(E7)\n\nthen, using Eq.

Staggering the quark fields discards identical copies, leaving just 16 distinct tastes. The naivequark bilinears corresponding to the staggered-quark bilinears are the ones that become diagonal after they are\nstaggered. Any other operator creates mesons that mix\ndifferent spinor components of the staggered quark operator \u03c7(x) (Eq. (B1)), and so is discarded when we stagger.\nWe can identify the bilinears that survive staggering\nby noting that\n\n\u2192 \u03c7\u03c7\n\n(E1)\n\nafter staggering provided \u03b6 = s.

This formula is related to a more\nstandard formula by staggering the meson operator:\n\n= \u03c7(x) \u03b3s\u2020 \u03b3x\u2020 \u03b3n \u03b3x+\u03b4xsn \u03c7(x \u2295 \u03b4xsn )\n\n(E12)\n\nwhere the shift \u03b4xsn guarantees that the product of \u03b3s is\nproportional to the unit matrix. We can rewrite this in\nterms of a sum over \u03b4xs in the positive unit hypercube:\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c7(x) 41 Tr \u03b3s\u2020 \u03b3x\u2020 \u03b3n \u03b3x+\u03b4x \u03c7(x \u2295 \u03b4x).\n(E13)\n\u03b4x\u03bc \u2208Z2\n\nEach taste s in the staggered theory corresponds to a\nspecific corner of the Brillouin zone, with ptot \u2248 s\u03c0, in the\nnaive-quark theory. These operators have zero signature\nand so are unchanged under doubling transformations\n(Eq. (6)).\nIt is useful for formal analyses, though less so for simulations, to introduce a slightly different definition for\nthese bilinears by defining a new operator on our naivequark field:\n\u03b3n \u2297 \u03bes \u03c8(x) \u2261 (\u22121)s*x \u03b3s\u2020 \u03b3n \u03c8(x \u2295 (n + s)),\n\n(E10)\n\nWe can effectively restrict our current to the \u03b6 = s\ncorner of the Brillouin zone by again blocking on 24 hypercubes to obtain\n\n(E2)\n\n(E3)\n\n(E9)\n\nNote that these definitions also imply that \u03bes anticommute just as \u03b3s: for example,\n\n\u03c8(x) \u03b3n \u2297 \u03bes \u03c8(x)\n\nwhere again \u03b4xsn = (s + n) mod 2 (with a = 1), and\n\u03b2n(s) (x) =\n\nwhich implies that in general\n\nJs(n) (xB ) =\n\nJn(\u03b6,s) \u221d \u03c7 \u03b3 \u2020\u03b6 \u03b3s \u03c7\n\n(E8)\n\n(E4)\n\nAveraging over the hypercube gives a standard formula\n(n)\nfor Js :\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1 X\n\u2020\n\u03b3n \u03b3\u03b4x\u2032 \u03c7(xB + \u03b4x\u2032 ).\n\u03c7(xB + \u03b4x) 14 Tr \u03b3s\u2020 \u03b3\u03b4x\n16\n\u2032\n\u03b4x,\u03b4x\n\n(E14)\nTaste and spinor structure in \u03c8(x)\u03b3n \u2297\u03bes \u03c8(x) are both\ndescribed by the same kind of four vector consisting of 0s\nand 1s. For this reason it is common practice to use the\nsame terminology for describing taste as we do for spinor\n\n\f19\nstructure. Thus, for example, \u03c8(x) \u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5 \u03c8(x) creates\na pseudoscalar meson with \"pseudoscalar taste.\" In this\ncase n = s = (1, 1, 1, 1), and, from Eq. (E2),\n(5)\n\n\u03c8(x) \u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5 \u03c8(x) = \u03b25 (x) \u03c7(x)\u03c7(x)\n= (\u22121)x*x \u03c7(x)\u03c7(x).\n\n(E15)\n\nA different pion is created by \u03c8(x)\u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5\u03bc \u03c8(x), this one\nwith axial-vector taste:\n(5\u03bc)\n\n\u03c8(x) \u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5\u03bc \u03c8(x) = \u03b25\n\n(x) \u03c7(x)\u03c7(x \u2295 \u03bc\u0302).\n\n(E16)\n\nThe pion created by this operator is sometimes called a\n5 \u2297 5\u03bc or \"1-link pion\" since the operator is split by one\nlink or lattice spacing. Similarly \u03c8(x)\u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5 \u03c8(x) creates\na 5 \u2297 5 or 0-link pion.\nOther naive-quark operators can be recast in terms of\nthe spinor/taste operators. For example, the naive-quark\naction has a chiral symmetry in the massless limit under\ntransformations\n\u03c8(x) \u2192 exp(i \u03b8 \u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5 ) \u03c8(x)\n\u03c8(x) \u2192 \u03c8(x) exp(i \u03b8 \u03b35 \u2297 \u03be5 ),\n\n(E17)\n\nwhere the \u03be5 s express the fact that the symmetry operation does not translate (move) \u03c8(x).\n\nTree-level contributions come from Fig. 1, but these\nvanish (by design) in the ASQTAD action because of\nASQTAD's quark-gluon vertex. The only one-loop contributions that are nonzero are those shown in Fig. 3; all\nother one-loop amplitudes have at least one quark line\nwith only one gluon attached, and these vanish, again,\nbecause of ASQTAD's quark-gluon vertex. The internal quarks and gluons in the remaining diagrams are all\nhighly virtual, and therefore these contributions can be\ncanceled by a sum of four-quark counterterms each consisting of a product of two quark bilinears (with one bilinear per quark line).\nThe types of quark bilinear that can arise from these\ndiagrams are greatly restricted by color conservation,\nchiral symmetry, and the doubling symmetry of the lagrangian. Quark bilinears can only carry singlet or octet\ncolor: thus color structure is either \u03c8\u03c8 or \u03c8T a \u03c8 where T a\nis an SU (3) generator in the fundamental representation.\nThe standard chiral symmetry of the naive-quark action\nin the massless limit implies that only vector and axialvector bilinears can arise in that limit: thus spinor structure is either \u03c8\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8 or \u03c8\u03b35\u03bc \u03c8. Finally doubling symmetry\n(Eq. (F1)) requires that the bilinears in the counterterms\nmust be point-split so that they are invariant under any\ndoubling transformation of their quark fields (Eq. (6)):\nthat is, we have\n\u03c8(x)\u03b3n \u03c8(x + \u03b4x(n))\n\n(F2)\n\n\u03c8(x)\u03b3n T a \u03c8(x + \u03b4x(n))\n\n(F3)\n\nAPPENDIX F: ONE LOOP TASTE-CHANGING\n\nor\n2\n\nThe Symanzik procedure for removing O(a ) one-loop\ntaste-exchange effects from the ASQTAD action involves\ntwo steps: 1) we compute taste-changing amplitudes for\nqq \u2192 qq with massless quarks in one-loop order using lattice perturbation theory; and 2) we design local\ntaste-changing counterterms for the staggered-quark action that cancel these one-loop amplitudes. We find it\neasiest to work with the naive-quark theory, converting\nto staggered quarks only at the end.\nIn order a2 we need only consider quarks at threshold - that is, quarks with momentum p = \u00b1\u03b6\u03c0 for one\nof the sixteen \u03b6's with \u03b6\u03bc \u2208 Z2 (where, again, a = 1).\nTaste-changing amplitudes are ones where the incoming and outgoing momenta along any particular quark\nline differ by \u03b6\u03c0 for one of the \u03b6s. For qq \u2192 qq, overall momentum conservation demands that the opposite\nchange occur along the other quark line. Consequently\nwhile taste changes along individual quark lines, total\ntaste is conserved. It is enough to compute amplitudes\nA(0, 0; \u03b6\u03c0, \u2212\u03b6\u03c0) where the initial quarks have zero momentum and the final quarks have momenta \u03b6\u03c0 for any \u03b6.\n(Recall that \u03b6\u03c0 and \u2212\u03b6\u03c0 are the same momentum on the\nlattice.) Amplitudes with other quark tastes in the initial state are related to these amplitudes by applying the\ndoubling symmetry to each quark line separately:\nA(\u03b6 \u2032 \u03c0, \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 \u03c0; (\u03b6 \u2032 + \u03b6)\u03c0, (\u03b6 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6)\u03c0) = A(0, 0; \u03b6\u03c0, \u2212\u03b6\u03c0) (F1)\nwhere \u03b6\u03bc\u2032 , \u03b6\u03bc\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Z2 .\n\nwhere n is \u03bc or 5\u03bc, and \u03b4x(n) is chosen to make the\nbilinear invariant under \u03c8 \u2192 B\u03b6 \u03c8 for all \u03b6. This last\nrestriction implies that the bilinears must be staggered(s)\nquark operators Jn , as defined in Appendix E.\nThe one-loop amplitude, A(0, 0; \u03b6\u03c0, \u2212\u03b6\u03c0), for a given \u03b6\nis canceled by a specific set of counterterms,\n1 X (s) (s) 2\nd |Jn | + color octet version\n2 n n\n\n(F4)\n\nwhere s = \u03b6 (from Eq. (E2)). Consider, for example, the\ncase where \u03b6\u03bc = 1 for some \u03bc while \u03b6\u03bd = 0 for all \u03bd 6= \u03bc.\nThe taste is s = \u03b6 or 5\u03bc. The spin n depends upon the\nspinor structure of A. For this \u03b6 there are four different spinor structures, each corresponding to a different\nstaggered-quark operator:\n(5\u03bc) 2\n\n(\u03c8\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8)2 \u2192 (J5\n2\n\n(\u03c8\u03b3\u03bd \u03c8)\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n(5\u03bc)\n(J\u03bc\u03bd )2 .\n\n(5\u03bc) 2\n\n(\u03c8\u03b35\u03bc \u03c8)2 \u2192 (J1\n2\n\n(\u03c8\u03b35\u03bd \u03c8)\n\n)\n\n(5\u03bc)\n(J5\u03bd\u03bc )2\n\n)\n\n(F5)\n\nEach of these operators comes in color octet and color\nsinglet versions, so eight counterterms are required to\ncancel A for \u03b6 2 = 1.\n\n\f20\n(s)\n\nThe coefficients dn in the counterterms are computed by on-shell matching of the scattering amplitude A(0, 0; \u03b6\u03c0, \u2212\u03b6\u03c0) to the sum of counterterms for\neach \u03b6. Our results are summarized in Table II. Only\nthe bilinears shown in Eq. (28) are needed here. The chiral perturbation theory devised by Lee and Sharpe [29]\nhas ten additional bilinears, but eight of these are not\ninvariant under doubling transformations for each quark\nline separately, and two do not involve taste exchange.\nAPPENDIX G: MESON PROPAGATORS\n\nThe b-quark resists large energies, as these drive it far off\nshell, but the staggered quark is on-shell when its energy\nE \u2248 0 or when E \u2248 \u03c0. These two possible states of\nthe light quark correspond to two different tastes. Consequently J5 couples to two different mesons: one whose\nlight quark has taste \u03b6 = 0, and one whose light quark\nhas taste \u03b6 = (1, 0, 0, 0) or E \u2248 \u03c0.\nThe first of these two meson states is the normal\n0\u2212 B meson. To interpret the second state, we transform the high-energy staggered-quark field back to a lowenergy field (which we understand, since it behaves normally) using the doubling symmetry formula, Eq. (6):\n\nThe fact that the single naive-quark field encodes sixteen different, identical tastes of quark has practical implications for simulations. For example, the operator\nJ5 (x) \u2261 \u03c8(x)\u03b35 \u03a8b (x),\n\n(G1)\n\nwhere \u03a8b is an unstaggered b-quark field and \u03c8 is a lightquark field, couples only to J P = 0\u2212 mesons in the continuum, including the B. If \u03c8 is a staggered field, however, it also couples to 0+ mesons [30].\nThe doubling-symmetry formula, Eq. (6), is useful in\ndecoding such situations. The second contribution from\nJ5 arises from high-energy states that couple to it. In\nsimulations one normally forms correlators like\nX\nG55 (t) \u2261\nh0|J5 (x, t)J5\u2020 (0, 0)|0i,\n(G2)\nx\n\n\u03c8(x)\n\nE\u2248\u03c0\n\n\u2192 \u03c8(x)(i\u03b35 \u03b30 )(\u22121)t .\n\n(G3)\n\nSubstituting in J5 we see that this component of the operator is\n\u2192 \u03c8(i\u03b35 \u03b30 )\u03b35 \u03a8b (\u22121)t = \u2212\u03c8i\u03b30 \u03a8b (\u22121)t .\n(G4)\nThe operator \u03c8i\u03b30 \u03a8b , now with low-energy fields, couples\nto 0+ mesons. (It is J = 0 because there is no threevector index. It is P = + because P\u03b30 P = \u03b30 where\nP \u2261 \u03b30 is the parity operator.) The full correlator has\ntwo components:\n\u03c8\u03b35 \u03a8b\n\nE\u2248\u03c0\n\nG55 (t) \u2192 |h0|\u03c8\u03b35 \u03a8b |0\u2212 i|2 e\u2212E\u2212 t\n\n\u2212 (\u22121)t |h0|\u03c8i\u03b30 \u03a8b |0+ i|2 e\u2212E+ t .\n\n(G5)\n\nwhere the sum over x guarantees that total three momentum p = 0. The operators, however, are not smeared in\ntime, and so can create arbitrarily high-energy states.\n\nThe second component, rather unconventionally, oscillates in sign from time step to time step.\n\n[1] C.
