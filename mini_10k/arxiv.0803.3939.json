The measurements of central exclusive production (CEP) is a prime target of the FP420\nproject [5], which aims at the installation of forward detectors in the LHC tunnel 420 m from\nthe interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The combined detection of both\noutgoing protons and the centrally produced system gives access to a rich programme of studies\nin QCD, electroweak, Higgs and BSM physics. Importantly, these measurements will provide\nvaluable information on the Higgs sector of MSSM and other popular BSM scenarios, see [6] - [9].\nIn particular, the CEP process allows for the unique possibility to study directly the coupling\nof Higgs-like bosons to bottom quarks [1, 10].\nThe theoretical formalism [11] - [13] for the description of a CEP process contains quite\ndistinct parts, shown symbolically in Fig. 1. We first have to calculate the gg \u2192 A subprocess,\nH, convoluted with the gluon distributions fg . Next we must account for the QCD corrections\nwhich reflect the absence of additional QCD radiation in the hard subprocess \u2013 that is, for the\nSudakov factor T . Finally, we must enter soft physics to calculate the survival probability S 2\nof the rapidity gaps.\nThe uncertainties of the CEP predictions are potentially not small. Therefore, it is important to perform checks using processes that will be accessible in the first runs of the LHC [14]\nwith integrated luminosities in the range 100 pb\u22121 to 1 fb\u22121 . In [14] we identified reactions\nwhere the different ingredients of the formalism used to calculate CEP could be tested experimentally. We first consider measurements which do not rely on proton tagging and can be\nperformed through the detection of rapidity gaps.\nThe main uncertainties of the CEP predictions are associated with\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 2: Diagrams for (a) W production with 2 rapidity gaps, (b) inclusive W production,\nand (c) Z production with 2 rapidity gaps.\n\n(i) the probability S 2 that additional secondaries will not populate the gaps;\n(ii) the probability to find the appropriate gluons, that are given by generalized, unintegrated\ndistributions fg (x, x\u2032 , Q2t );\n(iii) the higher order QCD corrections to the hard subprocess, where the most important is\nthe Sudakov suppression;\n(iv) the so-called semi-enhanced absorptive corrections (see [15, 16]) and other effects, which\nmay violate the soft-hard factorization.\n\n2\n\nGap survival probability S 2\n\nAs a rule, the gap survival probability is calculated within a multichannel eikonal approach\n[17]. The probability S 2 of elastic pp rescattering, shown symbolically by S in Fig. 1 can be\nevaluated in a model independent way once the elastic cross section d\u03c3el /dt is measured at the\nLHC. However, there may be some excited states between the blob S and the amplitude on the\nright-hand-side of Fig. 1. The presence of such states enlarges the absorptive correction. In\norder to experimentally check the role of this effect, we need to consider a process with a bare\ncross section that can be reliably calculated. Good candidates are the production of W or Z\nbosons with rapidity gaps. In the case of 'W +gaps' production the main contribution comes\nfrom the diagram shown in Fig. 2(a) [18]. One gap, \u2206\u03b71 , is associated with photon exchange,\nwhile the other, \u2206\u03b72 , is associated with the W . The cross section is proportional to the quark\ndistribution at a large scale and not too small x, where the uncertainties of the parton densities\nare small. To select these events in the early LHC runs, we can use the rapidity gap trigger\ncombined with a high pt lepton or jet trigger.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3: The rapidity gap survival factor S 2 as a function of \u03be calculated using the global soft\nmodel of [12], assuming that the valence (sea) quarks are associated with the weak (strong)\nabsorptive components. The small spread of the predictions arising from the different partonic\ncontent of the diffractive eigenstates means that W +gaps events offer a meaningful test of the\nS 2 factor.\nm2 \u03be 2\n\nN\n,\nAn important point here is that the minimum value of |t| of the photon, |tmin | \u2243 1\u2212\u03be\nis not negligible. Note that the momentum fraction xp = 1 \u2212 \u03be associated with the upper\nproton can be measured by summing the momentum fractions of the outgoing W and the\nhadrons observed in the calorimeters. As illustrated in Fig. 3 the rescattering reduces the cross\nsection by the factor S 2 . The curves in Fig. 3 were calculated within the scenario where the\nvalence quark is allocated to the component with the smallest absorption and the sea quark\nto the absorptive component with largest cross section. Since the valence quark contribution\nis more important for W + production and for the configuration with the largest gap size \u2206\u03b72 ,\nthe expected gap survival factor S 2 is found to be larger. In the first LHC data runs the\nratio (W +gaps/W inclusive) will be measured first. This measurement is a useful check of the\nmodels for soft rescattering.\n\nA good way to study the low impact parameter (bt ) region is to observe Z boson production\nvia W W fusion, see Fig. 2(c). Here, both of the rapidity gaps originate from heavy boson\nexchange, and the corresponding bt region is similar to that for exclusive Higgs production.\nThe expected Z+gaps cross section is of the order of 0.2 pb, and S 2 =0.3 for \u2206\u03b71,2 > 3 and for\nquark jets with ET > 50 GeV [19].\nOne problem is that even with the ET > 50 GeV cut, the QCD background arising from\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 4: Exclusive \u03a5 production via (a) photon exchange, and (b) via odderon exchange.\n\nQCD bb\u0304 central exclusive production is comparable to the electroweak q q\u0304 \u2192 Z + 2 jet signal.\nTherefore, we should concentrate on the leptonic decay modes of the Z boson, which results in\na smaller event rate 2 .\nWhen the forward proton detectors become operational we can do more. Both the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the protons can be measured, and we can study the kt\nbehaviour of the cross section sections and scan the proton opacity [18].\n\nGeneralized, unintegrated gluon distribution fg\n\n3\n\nThe cross section for the CEP of a system A essentially has the form [11]\nZ\ndQ2t\nS2 \u03c0\nfg (x1 , x\u20321 , Q2t , \u03bc2 )fg (x2 , x\u20322 , Q2t , \u03bc2 )\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 p + A + p) \u2243 2\nb 8\nQ4t\n\n2\n\n\u03c3\u0302(gg \u2192 A).\n\n(1)\n\nHere the factor 1/b2 arises from the integration over the proton transverse momentum. Also, fg\ndenotes the generalized unintegrated gluon distribution in the limit of pt \u2192 0. The distribution\nfg has not yet been measured explicitly. However, in our case it can be obtained from the\nconventional diagonal gluon distribution, g, known from the global parton analyses, see [11, 14]\nfor details. The main uncertainty here comes from the lack of knowledge of the integrated\ngluon distribution g(x, Q2t ) at low x and small scales. For example, taking Q2t = 4 GeV2\nwe find that a variety of recent MRST [21] and CTEQ [22] global analyses give a spread of\nxg = (3 \u2212 3.8) for x = 10\u22122\nand\nxg = (3.4 \u2212 4.5) for x = 10\u22123 . These are big\nuncertainties bearing in mind that the CEP cross section depends on (xg)4 .\nTo reduce the uncertainty associated with fg we can measure exclusive \u03a5 production 3 . The\nprocess is shown in Fig. 4(a). The cross section for \u03b3p \u2192 \u03a5p [23] is given in terms of exactly\nthe same unintegrated gluon distribution fg that occurs in Fig. 1.\n2\n\nNote that in the recent study [20] it was demonstrated that the so-called Track Counting Veto (TCV) is\nrobust for selection of the central rapidity gap events in vector-boson fusion searches at CMS.\n3\nA feasibility study of the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03a5p measurement performed by CMS [25] looks quite encouraging.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 5: The rapidities of the three jets in the central system. Note that the rapidity yA of\nthe whole central system does not necessarily occur at y = 0. The rapidity interval containing\nthe three jets is denoted by \u03b4\u03b7, outside of which there is no hadronic activity.\n\nThere may be competition between production via photon exchange, Fig. 4(a), and via\nodderon exchange, see Fig. 4(b). To date, odderon exchange has not been observed. On the\nother hand, a lowest-order calculation indicates that the odderon process (b) may be comparable\nto the photon-initiated process (a) (for example, [24]). If the upper proton is tagged, it will\nbe straightforward to separate the two mechanisms since odderon production has no 1/q 2 .\nsingularity characteristic of the photon.\nThe expression for \u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 \u03a5p) \u221d fg2 is given in [23]. In order to use this process to\nconstrain the gluon distribution it would be preferable to tag the lower proton.\n\n4\n\nThree-jet events as a probe of the Sudakov factor\n\nTraditionally, the search for the exclusive dijet signal at the Tevatron, pp\u0304 \u2192 p + jj + p\u0304, is\nperformed [26] by plotting the cross section in terms of the variable Rjj = Mjj /MA , where\nMA is the mass of the whole central system. The Rjj distribution is strongly smeared out\nby QCD bremsstrahlung, hadronization, the jet searching algorithm and other experimental\neffects [26, 27]. To weaken the role of smearing it was proposed in Ref. [27] to study the dijet\ndistribution in terms of a new variable\nRj = 2ET (cosh \u03b7 \u2217 )/MA ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere only the transverse energy and the rapidity \u03b7 of the jet with the largest ET are used in\nthe numerator. Here \u03b7 \u2217 = \u03b7 \u2212 yA where yA is the rapidity of the whole central system. Clearly\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 6: (a) A typical enhanced diagram, where the shaded boxes symbolically denote fg , and\nthe soft rescattering is on an intermediate parton, giving rise to a gap survival factor Sen ; (b)\nand (c) are the Reggeon and QCD representations, respectively.\n\nthe jet with the largest ET is less affected by hadronization, final parton radiation etc. At\nleading order, it is sufficient to consider the emission of a third jet, as shown in Fig. 5, where\nwe take all three jets to lie in a specified rapidity interval \u03b4\u03b7.\nThe cross section d\u03c3/dRj , as a function of Rj , for the exclusive production of a pair of high\nET dijets accompanied by a third jet was calculated and discussed in [27, 14]. It was shown\nthat the measurements of the exclusive two- and three-jet cross sections as a function of ET\nof the highest jet allow a detailed check of the Sudakov physics; with much more information\ncoming from the observation of the \u03b4\u03b7 dependence.\nA clear way to observe the effect of the Sudakov suppression is just to study the ET dependence of exclusive dijet production. On dimensional grounds we would expect d\u03c3/dET2 \u221d 1/ET4 .\nThis behaviour is modified by the anomalous dimension of the gluon and by a stronger Sudakov\nsuppression with increasing ET . Already the existing CDF dijet data [26] exclude predictions\nwhich omit the Sudakov effect.\n\n5\n\nSoft-hard factorization: enhanced absorptive effects\n\nThe soft-hard factorization implied by Fig. 1 could be violated by the so-called enhanced\nReggeon diagrams, caused by the rescattering of an intermediate parton generated in the evolution of fg . Such a diagram is shown in Fig. 6(a).\nThe contribution of the first Pomeron loop diagram, Fig. 6(b) was calculated in pQCD in\nRef. [16]. A typical diagram is shown in Fig. 6(c). For LHC energies it was found that the\nprobability of such rescattering may be numerically large. The reason is that the gluon density\n\n7\n\n\fgrows in the low x region and, for low kt partons, approaches the saturation limit. However,\nas shown in [14], the enhanced diagram should affect mainly the very beginning of the QCD\nevolution \u2013 the region that cannot be described perturbatively and which, in the calculations\nof [12, 13], is already included phenomenologically.\nExperimentally, we can study the role of semi-enhanced absorption by measuring the ratio\nR of diffractive events for W (or \u03a5 or dijet) production as compared to the inclusive process\n[14]. That is\nR =\n\nno. of (A + gap) events\nno. of (inclusive A) events\n\n=\n\nadiff (xIP , \u03b2, \u03bc2)\n2\nhS 2 Sen\niover bt ,\naincl (x = \u03b2xIP , \u03bc2 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere aincl and adiff are the parton densities determined from the global analyses of inclusive\nand diffractive DIS data, respectively. For W or \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 production the parton densities a are\nquark distributions, whereas for dijet or \u03a5 they are mainly gluon densities.\nExperimentally, we can observe a double distribution d2 \u03c3 diff /dxIP dyA , and form the ratio\nR using the inclusive cross section, d\u03c3 incl /dyA . If we neglect the enhanced absorption, it is\nquite straightforward to calculate the ratio R of (3). The results for a dijet case are shown\nby the dashed curves in Fig. 7 as a function of the rapidity yA of the dijet system. The\nenhanced rescattering reduce the ratios and lead to steeper yA distributions, as illustrated by\n2\nthe continuous curves. Perhaps the most informative probe of Sen\nis to observe the ratio R for\ndijet production in the region ET \u223c 15 \u2212 30 GeV. For example, for ET \u223c 15 GeV we predict\n2\nSen\n\u223c 0.25, 0.4 and 0.8 at yA = \u22122, 0 and 2 respectively.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nThe addition of forward proton detectors to LHC experiments will add unique capabilities\nto the existing LHC experimental programme. For certain BSM scenarios, the tagged-proton\nmode may even be the Higgs discovery channel. There is also a rich QCD, electroweak, and\nmore exotic physics, menu.\nThe uncertainties in the prediction of the rate of a CEP process are potentially not small.\nTherefore, it is crucial to perform checks of the theoretical formalism using processes that will\nbe experimentally accessible in the first runs of the LHC [14].\nMost of the diffractive measurements described above can be performed, without detecting\nthe forward protons, by taking advantage of the relatively low luminosity in the early LHC\ndata runs. This allows the use of a veto trigger to select events with a large rapidity gap(s).\nIn this way we are able to probe the various individual components of the formalism used to\npredict the CEP cross sections.\nTo summarise, the gap survival factor, S 2 , caused by eikonal rescattering, may be studied\n2\nas illustrated in Fig 3 and the possible enhanced, Sen\n, contributions as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 7: The predictions of the ratio R of (3) for the production of a pair of high ET jets with\n(continuous curves) and without (dashed curves) enhanced soft rescattering on intermediate\npartons.\n\n9\n\n\fThe relevant unintegrated gluon distribution, fg , can be constrained by observing \u03a5 production,\nsee Fig. 4, and the QCD radiative effect, T , may be checked by observing exclusive two- and\nthree-jet events.\nWhen the forward proton detectors are operating much more can be done. First, it is possible\nto measure directly the cross section d2 \u03c3SD /dtdMX2 for single diffractive dissociation and also\nthe cross section d2 \u03c3DPE /dy1dy2 for soft central diffractive production. These measurements\nwill strongly constrain the models used to describe diffractive processes and the effects of soft\nrescattering. The recent predictions can be found in [13]. Next, a study of the transverse\nmomentum distributions of both of the tagged protons, and the correlations between their\nmomenta, is able to scan the proton optical density [18, 28].\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Mike Albrow, Brian Cox, Albert De Roeck, Sasha Nikitenko, Andy Pilkington,\nand Risto Orava for encouragement and for valuable advice.
