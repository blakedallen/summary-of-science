Fix integers k \u2265 2, M \u2265 2k + 1 and a k-uple\nof integers (d1 , . . . , dk ) \u2208 Zk+ , satisfying the conditions\ndk \u2265 . . . \u2265 d1 \u2265 2 and d1 + . . . + dk = M + k.\nThe symbol P stands for the complex projective space PM +k . Take homogeneous\npolynomials fi \u2208 H 0 (P, OP (di )) \\ {0}, i = 1, . . . , k, on P. By the symbol\nF (f1 , . . . , fk ) = F (f\u2217 )\nwe denote the closed algebraic set\n{f1 = . . . = fk = 0} \u2282 P.\nLet\nF\u2282\n\nk\nY\n\nP(H 0 (P, OP (di )))\n\ni=1\n\nbe the space of Fano complete intersections of type (d1 , . . . , dk ), that is, F is the set\nof irreducible reduced complete intersections of codimension k in P. Every variety\nF \u2208 F is a Fano variety of index one and dimension M. The anticanonical degree\nof the variety F is d = d1 . . . dk . Let Fsm \u2282 F be the space of smooth Fano complete\nintersections.\n1\n\n\fLet F = F (f1 , . . . , fk ) \u2208 F be a Fano complete intersection, x \u2208 F a point. Let\nCM +k \u2282 P be a standard affine chart, (z1 , . . . , zM +k ) a system of linear coordinates on\nCM +k with the origin at the point x. For each i = 1, . . . , k we have the presentation\nfi = qi,1 + . . . + qi,di ,\nwhere qi,j (z\u2217 ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j. Recall\nDefinition 0.1 [1]. A smooth point x \u2208 F is regular, if the set of polynomials\n{qi,j | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 di , (i, j) 6= (k, dk )},\n\n(1)\n\nconsisting of all homogeneous polynomials qi,j , except for the very last one qk,dk ,\nmakes a regular sequence in Ox,P , that is, the system of equations\n{qi,j = 0 | (i, j) 6= (k, dk )}\n\n(2)\n\ndefines a closed set of dimension one in CM +k , that is, a finite set of lines passing\nthrough the origin.\nProjectivizing CM +k , one can formulate the regularity condition in the following\nway: the system (2) defines a zero-dimensional set in PM +k\u22121 . If x \u2208 F is a regular\npoint, then there are at most finitely many lines on F passing through x. (The\nconverse, generally speaking, is not true.)\nNote that regularity of the sequence (1) implies smoothness of the point x \u2208 F .\nIn Definition 1 we intentionally assumed that the point is smooth, in order to be\nable to extend the regularity condition to singular points.\nDefinition 0.2. A singular point x \u2208 F is regular, if\n(i) it is a non-degenerate quadratic singularity;\n(ii) the system of equations (2) defines a closed set of dimension two in CM +k\n(respectively, a curve in PM +k\u22121 ), the linear span of each irreducible component of\nwhich is\nT = {q1,1 = q2,1 = . . . = qk,1 = 0}.\nIf x \u2208 F is a singularity, then the linear forms qi,1 , i = 1, . . . , k, are linear\ndependent. The regularity of the point x \u2208 F means that, deleting from the set (1)\nexactly one linear form, say q1,e , we obtain a regular sequence, that is, the system\nof equations\n(3)\n{qi,j = 0 | (i, j) 6\u2208 {(1, e), (k, dk )}}\ndefines a two-dimensional set in CM +k (respectively, a curve in PM +k\u22121 ). In particular, codim T = k \u2212 1 and the tangent cone Tx F \u2282 T is a non-degenerate quadric.\nMoreover, it follows from the regularity condition that, replacing in the set (1) the\nlinear form q1,e by an arbitrary linear form l(z1 , . . . , zM +k\u22121 ), such that l | T 6\u2261 0, we\nobtain a regular sequence, since neither component of the closed set (3) is contained\nin the hyperplane l = 0.\nThe following fact was proved in [1].\nAny smooth variety F \u2208 F , regular at every point x \u2208 F , is birationally superrigid. In particular, F has no non-trivial structures of a rationally connected fiber\n2\n\n\fspace (and, moreover, non-trivial structures of a fiber space into varieties of negative Kodaira dimension), F is non-rational and the groups of birational and biregular\nautomorphisms of the variety F coincide: Bir F = Aut F .\nSince the singular Fano complete intersections form a divisor Fsing = F \\ Fsm ,\nfor any Fano fiber space \u03c0: V \u2192 P1 , each fiber of which Ft = \u03c0 \u22121 (t), t \u2208 P1 , is\na Fano complete intersection, Ft \u2208 F , there are singular fibers Ft \u2208 Fsing (unless\nV = F \u00d7 P1 for some F \u2208 Fsm , but we do not consider these fiber spaces here).\nLet Freg \u2282 F be the set of complete intersections, satisfying the regularity condition at every point (smooth or singular).\nProposition 0.1. The following estimate holds: codimF (F \\ Freg ) \u2265 2.\nProof. The computations of [1] show that the complete intersections F \u2208 F ,\nnon-regular at at least one smooth point x \u2208 F , form a subset of codimension > 2\nin F (see [1 , p. 76]). On the other hand, it is obvious that the varieties F , that\nhave at least one non-regular singular point, form a proper closed subset in Fsing .\nQ.E.D. for the proposition.\n0.2. Fano fiber spaces. Let \u03c0: V \u2192 P1 be a Fano fiber space, the fibers of\nwhich are complete intersections of type (d1 , . . . , dk ) in P, that is, Ft = \u03c0 \u22121 (t) \u2208 F\nfor t \u2208 P1 . For the variety V we assume the following:\n\u2022 V is smooth,\n\u2022 A1 V = Pic V = ZKV \u2295 ZF, A2 V = ZKV2 \u2295 ZHF ,\nwhere HF = (\u2212KV * F ) is the anticanonical section of the fiber. By the symbols\nA1+ V \u2282 A1R V and A2+ V \u2282 A2R V we denote the closed cones of the pseudoeffective\ncycles of codimension one (that is, divisors) and two, respectively. Set also A1mov V \u2282\nA1R V to be the closed cone generated by the classes of movable divisors in A1R V =\nA1 V \u2297 R.\nNow let us formulate the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 1. Assume that the Fano fiber space V /P1 satisfies the following\nconditions:\n(i) (the regularity condition) Ft \u2208 Freg for every point t \u2208 P1 ,\n(ii) (the K 2 -condition of depth 2) KV2 + 2HF 6\u2208 Int A2+ V .\nThen for any movable linear system \u03a3 \u2282 | \u2212 nKV + lF | with l \u2208 Z+ its virtual\nand actual thresholds of canonical adjunction coincide, cvirt (\u03a3) = c(\u03a3) = n. If,\nmoreover, the fiber space V /P1 satisfies the condition\n(iii) (K-condition) \u2212KV 6\u2208 Int A1mov V ,\nthen the variety V is birationally superrigid.\nCorollary 1. Assume that the Fano fiber space V /P1 satisfies the conditions\n(i)-(iii) of the theorem above. Then the projection \u03c0: V \u2192 P1 is the only nontrivial structure of a fibration into varieties of negative Kodaira dimension on V .\nThe variety V is non-rational, its groups of birational and biregular automorphisms\ncoincide: Bir V = Aut V ; for a generic V this group is trivial.\n\n3\n\n\fProof of the corollary. These claims follow from birational superrigidity in\nthe standard way, see [2-5].\n0.3. Explicit constructions. Let a\u2217 = {0 = a0 \u2264 a1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 aM +k } be a nonM\n+k\nL\ndecreasing sequence of non-negative integers, E =\nOP1 (ai ) a locally free sheaf\ni=0\n\non P1 , X = P(E) the corresponding projective bundle in the sense of Grothendieck.\nObviously, we have\nPic X = ZLX \u2295 ZR,\n\nKX = \u2212(M + k + 1)LX + (aX \u2212 2)R,\n\nwhere LX is the class of the tautological sheaf, R is the class of a fiber of the\nM +k+1\nmorphism \u03c0: X \u2192 P1 , aX = a1 + . . . + aM +k . Furthermore, we get LX\n= aX .\nk\nFor some k-uple (b1 , . . . , bk ) \u2208 Z+ let\nGi \u2208 | di LX + bi R|\nbe irreducible divisors such that the complete intersection\nV = G1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Gk \u2282 X\nis a smooth subvariety. The projection \u03c0 | V : V \u2192 P1 is denoted by the same symbol\n\u03c0, the fiber \u03c0 \u22121 (t) \u2282 V by the symbol Ft , the restriction LX | V by L. Obviously,\nPic V = ZL \u2295 ZF, KV = \u2212L + (aX + bX \u2212 2)F,\nwhere bX = b1 + . . . + bk . It is easy to check the formulae\nM\n\n(L\n\nM \u22121\n\n* F ) = (HF * L\n\nM +1\n\n) = d, L\n\nk\nX\nbi\n= d(aX +\n),\nd\ni\ni=1\n\nwhere d = d1 . . . dk is the degree of the fiber.

The proof consists of two parts: firstly, we\nformulate a sufficient condition of birational superrigidity (Theorem 2), secondly,\nwe check this condition for varieties with a pencil of Fano complete intersections.\n1.1. The method of maximal singularities. In this subsection we consider\nFano fiber spaces V /P1 , not assuming that the fibers Ft , t \u2208 P1 , are taken from some\nparticular family of Fano varieties. We assume only that V is a smooth variety, that\nthe conditions\nA1 V = Pic V = ZKV \u2295 ZF,\n\nA2 V = ZKV2 \u2295 ZHF\n\nhold, where HF = (\u2212KV * F ) is the ample anticanonical section of the fiber, and\nthat the fibers Ft , t \u2208 P1 , have at most isolated factorial singularities, and moreover\nPic Ft = A1 Ft = ZKFt and A2 Ft = ZKF2t for every t \u2208 P1 . The symbols A1+ V , A2+ V\nand A1mov V mean the same as above. The general idea of the method of maximal\nsingularities is to reduce the problem of birational rigidity of a Fano fiber space\nV /P1 to certain problems of numerical geometry of its fibers and to numerical characteristics of \"twistedness\" of the fiber space V /P1 over the base. In this subsection\nwe formulate a sufficient condition of birational superrigidity, realizing one of the\nversions of such reduction. For another versions, see [3,4].\nBy the degree of an irreducible subvariety Y \u2282 V , contained in a fiber, Y \u2282 Ft\n(such subvarieties are said to be vertical), we mean the integer\ndeg Y = (Y * (\u2212KV )dimY ).\nBy the degree of an irreducible subvariety Y \u2282 V , covering the base P1 , \u03c0(Y ) = P1\n(such subvarieties are said to be horizontal), we mean the integer\ndeg Y = (Y * F * (\u2212KV )dimY\u22121).\nDefinition 1.1 [4]. The fiber space V /P1 satisfies\n\u2022 the condition (v), if for any irreducible vertical subvariety Y of codimension\ntwo (that is, Y \u2282 Ft is a prime divisor, t = \u03c0(Y )) and any smooth point o \u2208 Ft\nthe inequality\nmulto Y\n2\n\u2264\ndeg Y\ndeg V\nholds;\n5\n\n\f\u2022 the condition (f ), if for any irreducible vertical subvariety Y of codimension\nthree (that is, codimF Y = 2, F = Ft \u2283 Y ) and any smooth point of the fiber\no \u2208 F the following inequality holds:\n4\nmulto Y\n\u2264\n.\ndeg Y\ndeg V\n\n(4)\n\nFor convenience of notations the ratio of the multiplicity to the degree is written\ndown in the sequel by one symbol\nmulto\nmulto Y\nY =\n.\ndeg\ndeg Y\nLet \u03a3 \u2282 | \u2212 nKV + lF | be a movable linear system, l \u2208 Z+ . Recall [1-6]\nDefinition 1.2. An exceptional divisor E of a birational morphism \u03c6: Ve \u2192 V ,\nwhere Ve is a smooth projective variety (we can restrict ourselves by the morphisms\n\u03c6 of the type \u03c6N \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03c61 , where \u03c6i is a blow up with an irreducible center), is a\nmaximal singularity of the linear system \u03a3, if the Noether-Fano inequality\n\u03bdE (\u03a3) > na(E)\n\n(5)\n\nholds, where \u03bdE (\u03a3) = ordE \u03c6\u2217 \u03a3 is the multiplicity of the pull back of a general\ndivisor of the system \u03a3 along E, a(E) is the discrepancy, n \u2208 Z+ was defined above.\nFor n \u2265 1 the inequality (5) means that the pair (V, n1 \u03a3) is non-canonical and E \u2282 Ve\nis its non-canonical singularity. The irreducible subvariety\nB = \u03c6(E) = centre (E, V )\nis called the center of the non-canonical (maximal) singularity E.\nTheorem 2. Assume that the Fano fiber space V /P1 satisfies the generalized\nK 2 -condition of depth 2, that is,\nKV2 + 2HF 6\u2208 Int A2+ V,\nand the conditions (v) and (f ), formulated above.\n(i) If the center of every maximal singularity of a movable linear system \u03a3 \u2282\n| \u2212 nKV + lF | with l \u2208 Z+ is not a singular point of a fiber, then the virtual and\nactual thresholds of canonical adjunction of the system \u03a3 coincide: cvirt (\u03a3) = c(\u03a3).\n(ii) If the assumption of (i) holds for any movable linear system on V and the\nvariety V satisfies the K-condition, that is,\n\u2212KV 6\u2208 Int A1mov V,\nthen the variety V is birationally superrigid.\nFor the proof of the theorem, see [4]. Now we just note that the claim (ii) follows\nfrom (i) in an obvious way. Theorem 2 reduces proving birational superrigidity to\nchecking the K 2 -condition, K-condition, the conditions (v) and (f ) and, finally, to\nexcluding the maximal singularities, the center of which is a singular point of a fiber.\nNote that\n6\n\n\f\u2022 the K 2 - and K-conditions are checked in a routine way, usually it is an easy\nthing to do, and, in a sense, a \"majority\" of Fano fiber spaces satisfies these\nconditions, see Proposition 0.2 above;\n\u2022 usually the conditions (v) and (f ) are known, given that every fiber is birationally superrigid, since it is via checking the inequality of the condition (f )\nthat birational superrigidity of a Fano variety is usually being proved, whereas\nthe condition (v) follows from (f ) in an easy way (see below);\n\u2022 it is excluding of a maximal singularity lying over a singular point of a fiber\nthat has ever been the hardest part of the proof, its heart [3,7], however,\nemploying the connectedness principle of Shokurov and Koll\u00e1r [8,9] makes it\npossible to considerably simplify this part, in the way in which it is done below,\neven slightly relaxing the conditions of general position compared to [3,7].\n1.2. Proof of Theorem 1. The condition (f ) was shown in [1]. Let us prove\n(v). Let Y \u2282 F = Ft be a prime divisor, o \u2208 Y a point. Take a general hyperplane\nH \u2282 P, tangent to F at the point o, that is, H \u2283 To F . Set T = H \u2229F . By generality,\nY 6= T , so that YT = (Y \u25e6 T ) is a well defined effective cycle of codimension two on\nF , and moreover,\nmulto\nmulto\nYT \u2265 2\nY.\ndeg\ndeg\nNow the condition (f ) implies (v).\nIt remains to check that the center of a maximal singularity of the pair (V, n1 \u03a3)\ncannot be a singular point of a fiber. Assume the converse: in the notations of Sec.\n1.1 centre(E, V ) = o \u2208 F is a singularity of the fiber. Let \u03bb: F + \u2192 F be the blow\nup of the point o, \u03bb\u22121 (o) = E + \u2282 F + the exceptional divisor. The blow up \u03bb can be\nlooked at as the restriction of the blow up \u03bbP : P+ \u2192 P of the point o on P, so that\n\u223c M +k\u22121\nE + \u2282 E is a non-singular quadric of dimension M \u2212 1, where E = \u03bb\u22121\nP (o) = P\nis the exceptional divisor.\nProposition 1.1. There exists a hyperplane section B of the quadric E + \u2282 E,\nsatisfying the inequality\nmultB (\u03bb\u2217 \u03a3F ) > 2n.\nProof: it follows from the connectedness principle of Shokurov and Koll\u00e1r [8,9],\nfor the details see [5 , Sec. 3].\nLet D \u2208 \u03a3F = \u03a3 | F be an effective divisor on F , D \u2208 |nHF |. By Proposition\n1.1, the inequality\nmulto D + 2 multB D + > 4n\nholds, where D + \u2282 F + is its strict transform on F + . Let H \u2282 P be a general\nhyperplane, containing the point o and cutting out B, that is,\nH + \u2229 E + = (H + \u2229 E) \u2229 E + = B,\n\n7\n\n\fH + \u2282 P+ is the strict transform. Set T = H \u2229 F . The variety T is a complete intersection of type (d1 , . . . , dk ) in H = PM +k\u22121 with an isolated quadratic singularity\nat the point o. The effective divisor DT = (D \u25e6 T ) on T satisfies the inequality\nmulto DT > 4n.\n\n(6)\n\nObviously, DT \u2208 |nHT |, where HT is the hyperplane section of T \u2282 PM +k\u22121. By linearity, one may assume the divisor DT to be prime, that is, an irreducible subvariety\nof codimension one.\nNow, repeating the arguments of [1, Sec. 2] word for word, we obtain a contradiction.\nIt is possible to repeat the arguments word for word due to the stronger regularity\ncondition at the point o \u2208 F : the hyperplane section T \u2282 PM +k\u22121 satisfies the\nordinary regularity condition at this point.\nThis scheme of arguments was suggested and first used in [10, Sec. 3] for the\npencils of Fano hypersurfaces.\nQ.E.D. for Theorem 1.\nRemark 1.1. Starting with the pioneer paper [6] and up to [4], the technique\nof excluding infinitely near maximal singularities almost always was quadratic, that\nis, making use of the operation of taking the self-intersection of the movable linear\nsystem \u03a3. As the proof above shows, for certain types of maximal singularities\nthe linear technique, based on the connectedness principle of Shokurov and Koll\u00e1r\n(which, in its turn, is based on the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem [11-13]),\nis more effective. Combining the quadratic and linear methods makes it possible\nto simplify the proof and in some cases relax the conditions of general position\n(compare [3,4,14]).\n\n2\n\nRelated results\n\n2.1. Divisorially canonical complete intersections. Recall the following\nDefinition 2.1 [5]. We say that a primitive Fano variety F is divisorially\ncanonical, or satisfies the condition (C) (respectively, is divisorially log canonical, or\nsatisfies the condition (L)), if for any effective divisor D \u2208 | \u2212 nKF |, n \u2265 1, the pair\n1\n(F, D)\n(7)\nn\nhas canonical (respectively, log canonical) singularities. If the pair (7) has canonical\nsingularities for a general divisor D \u2208 \u03a3 \u2282 | \u2212 nKF | of any movable linear system\n\u03a3, then we say that F satisfies the condition of movable canonicity, or the condition\n(M).\nThe following fact was proved in [5].\nAssume that primitive Fano varieties F1 , . . . , FK , K \u2265 2, satisfy the conditions\n(L) and (M). Then their direct product\nV = F1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 FK\n8\n\n\fis birationally superrigid.\nTo prove the condition (C), one needs much stronger regularity conditions than\nto prove the condition (M), which already implies birational superrigidity. In the\nnotations of Sec. 0.1 let us give\nDefinition 2.2. A smooth point x \u2208 F satisfies the stronger regularity condition\n+\n(R ), if for every linear form l(z\u2217 ), that does not vanish identically on the tangent\nspace\nTx F = {q1,1 = . . . = qk,1 = 0},\nthe following set of polynomials:\n{l} \u222a {qi,j |1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 di , (i, j) 6\u2208 {(k, dk ), (k \u2212 1, dk\u22121)}}\nprovided that dk\u22121 = dk , and\n{l} \u222a {qi,j |1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 di , (i, j) 6\u2208 {(k, dk ), (k, dk \u2212 1)}}\nprovided that dk\u22121 \u2264 dk \u2212 1, makes a regular sequence in Ox,P .\nProposition 2.1. When k \u2265 2, M \u2265 4k + 1, there exists a non-empty Zariski\n+\nopen subset Freg\n\u2282 Freg of smooth Fano complete intersections, satisfying the con+\ndition (R ) at every point.\nProof is obtained by a routine dimension count by the methods of [1,15]. The\nscheme of arguments is as follows. Without loss of generality assume that qi,1 \u2261\nzM +i . It is necessary to estimate the codimension of the set of non-regular sequences\n{ \u0304l} \u222a {q\u0304i,j |1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 2 \u2264 j \u2264 di , (i, j) 6\u2208 {(k, dk ), (k \u2212 1, dk\u22121)}}\n(respectively,\n{ \u0304l} \u222a {q\u0304i,j |1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 2 \u2264 j \u2264 di , (i, j) 6\u2208 {(k, dk ), (k, dk \u2212 1)}}\nfor the case dk\u22121 \u2264 dk \u22121), where  \u0304l, q\u0304ij are homogeneous polynomials in the variables\nz1 , . . . , zM . We need this codimension to be at least 2M + 1. For M \u2265 4k + 1\na straightforward combination of the methods of [1] and [15] gives the required\ninequality which proves the proposition.\nRemark 2.1. More refined computations make it possible to prove that the set\n+\nFreg is non-empty (by the same methods) under somewhat weaker assumptions for\nM, k.\n+\nTheorem 3. The complete intersection F \u2208 Freg\nsatisfies the condition (C) for\nM \u2265 4k + 1, dk \u2265 8.\nProof. Assume the converse: for some divisor D \u2208 |nH| the pair (F, n1 D) is not\ncanonical, that is, it has a maximal singularity E \u2282 Ve ,\n\u03bdE (D) > na(E),\n\n9\n\n\fwhere \u03c6: Ve \u2192 V is a sequence of blow ups, E is an exceptional divisor. We may\nassume D to be irreducible. Since for any irreducible subvariety B \u2282 F of dimension\n\u2265 k we have multB D \u2264 n (see below Sec. 2.3), we obtain the inequality\nmultx D + multY D + > 2n\nfor some point x \u2208 F and a hyperplane Y \u2282 E + in the exceptional divisor E + \u2282 F +\nof the blow up of the point x, \u03bb: F + \u2192 F , E + = \u03bb\u22121 (x), see [5,10] for the details.\nLet T \u2282 F be a general hyperplane section, containing the point x and satisfying\nthe condition T + \u2229 E + = Y , where T + \u2282 F + is the strict transform of the divisor\nT . By generality, we get Supp D 6\u2282 T , so that DT = (D \u25e6 T ) is an effective divisor\non T , DT \u2208 |nHT |, satisfying the inequality multx DT > 2n.\nLet us show that this is impossible. In order to do that, we apply to the effective\ndivisor DT on the complete intersection T the technique of hypertangent divisors in\nexactly the same way as it was done for a subvariety of codimension two in [1 , Sec.\n2]. As a result, we obtain the estimate\nmultx\n2\n3\ndk\nd+\nDT \u2264\n* max{1, *\n*\n},\ndeg\ndeg F\n4 dk \u2212 1 d+ \u2212 1\nwhere d+ = dk , if dk\u22121 = dk , and d+ = dk \u2212 1, otherwise. If M \u2265 4k + 1 and dk \u2265 8,\nthis implies the inequality multx DT \u2264 2n, which is what we need.\nQ.E.D. for the theorem.\n2.2. Structures of relative Kodaira dimension zero. By the relative\nKodaira dimension of the fiber space \u03b2: W \u2192 S we mean the Kodaira dimension of\na fiber of general position \u03b2 \u22121 (s), s \u2208 S. Notation: \u03ba(W/S).\nProposition 2.2. Let F be an arbitrary primitive Fano variety, \u03c7: F 99K W a\nstructure of a fiber space, that is, a birational map. Assume that the inequality\ndim S + \u03ba(W/S) < dim W\nholds (that is, the fiber of the fiber space W/S is not a variety of general type). Then\nfor any movable linear system \u03a3S on S the pair (F, n1 (\u03c7\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03a3S ) is not terminal,\nwhere \u03a3 = (\u03c7\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03a3S \u2282 | \u2212 nKF | is the strict transform of the system \u03b2 \u2217 \u03a3S on F .\nProof is almost word for word the same as the proof of existence of a maximal\nsingularity in the case of Kodaira dimension \u2212\u221e. Assume the converse: the pair\n(F, n1 \u03a3) is terminal. Let \u03c6: Fe \u2192 F be a resolution of singularities of the map \u03c7,\n\u03c8 = \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03c6 the composite map, a birational morphism. By the assumption, for each\nexceptional divisor E \u2282 Fe of the morphism \u03c6 we have \u03bdE (\u03a3) < na(E). Let D \u2208 \u03a3\nbe a general divisor. Since there are finitely many exceptional divisors, for some\nn+ \u2208 Q+ , n+ < n, we get in A1Q Fe:\ne + n+ K\ne = (n \u2212 n+ )\u03c6\u2217 (\u2212KF ) + D \u266f ,\nD\n\ne is the strict transform of D, K\ne is the canonical class of Fe, D \u266f is an effective\nwhere D\ndivisor.

Q.E.D. for the proposition.\nProposition 2.3. Let \u03c0: V \u2192 P1 be a fibration into primitive Fano varieties, as\ndescribed in Sec. 0.2. Assume in addition that\n\u2212KV 6\u2208 A1mov V.\nThen for any structure of a fiber space \u03c7: V 99K W with \u03ba(W/S) < dim(W/S) =\ndim W \u2212 dim S the pair (V, n1 (\u03c7\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03a3S ) is not terminal, where \u03a3 = (\u03c7\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03a3S \u2282\n| \u2212 nKV + lF |.\nProof is word for word the same as in the absolute case above, taking into\naccount that l \u2265 1 and for a sufficiently small \u03b5 \u2208 Q+ the linear system\n|N!(\u2212\u03b5KV + lF )|\ndefines a birational map. Q.E.D. for the proposition.\nWhen \u03ba(W/S) = 0, Proposition 2.3 can be refined. Let \u03c6: Ve \u2192 V be a resolution\nof singularities of \u03c7, \u03c8 = \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03c6 the composite map, a birational morphism. If the\npair (V, n1 \u03a3) is non-canonical, let M = {E1 , . . . , Ek } be the set of all maximal\nsingularities of the system \u03a3, that is, the exceptional divisors E \u2282 Ve , satisfying\nthe strict (that is, the usual) Noether-Fano inequality \u03bdE (\u03a3) > na(E). If the pair\n(V, n1 \u03a3) is canonical, set M = \u2205. Now set\nMt = {E \u2208 M| centre(E) = \u03c6(E) \u2282 Ft }\nto be the set of maximal singularities, the centers of which are contained in the fiber\nFt over some point t \u2208 P1 . Set also\n[\nMt )\nMh = M \\ (\nt\u2208P1\n\nto be the set of horizontal maximal singularities, the centers of which cover the base\nP1 .\nProposition 2.4. In the notations above assume that \u03ba(W/S) = 0 and the structure \u03c7 is not fiber-wise with respect to \u03c0, that is, the strict transform (\u03c7\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b2 \u22121 (s)\nof a general fiber of the fibration \u03b2: W \u2192 S on V covers the base P1 . Then M =\n6 \u2205.\nh\nIf, in addition, M = \u2205, then the following inequality holds:\n\u03bdE (\u03a3) \u2212 na(E)\n\u2265l\n{E\u2208Mt }\n\u03bdE (Ft )\n\n\u03a3t\u2208P1 max\n\n11\n\n(8)\n\n\fProof of the fact that M =\n6 \u2205 is word for word the same as the proof of Proposition 2.3: assume the converse, take n+ = n and use the fact that we obtain a linear\nsystem with a non-empty movable part, since the system |F | is movable. Taking\ninto account that \u03c7 is not fiber-wise with respect to \u03c0, this contradicts the condition\n\u03ba(W/S) = 0 and proves the existence of a maximal singularity. Proof of the second\nclaim is word for word the same as the proof of Proposition 1.3 in [4], with the only\ndifference: by what has been just said, the linear system\n| lF \u2212 \u03a3E\u2208M (\u03bdE (\u03a3) \u2212 na(E))|\n\n(9)\n\ncannot have a non-empty movable part. In [4] the case under consideration was\n\u03ba(W/S) = \u2212\u221e, so the system (9) had to be empty. For this reason the inequality\n(8) turns out to be non-strict. Q.E.D. for the proposition.\nRemark 2.2. As one can see from the arguments of this section, description\nof the structures of a fibration of relative Kodaira dimension zero (in fact, of any\nnon-maximal Kodaira dimension for primitive Fano varieties) is completely similar\nto the case of negative Kodaira dimension. If it is possible to study the structures of\nnegative Kodaira dimension for a certain class of Fano varieties or Fano fiber spaces,\nthen the very same arguments (with minimal modifications) work successfully for the\nstructures with \u03ba = 0, either. This observation belongs to Cheltsov: [16,17,18,19]\nreproduced the arguments of [15,20 and 21, 22 and 23, 2], respectively, which gave\na description of K-trivial structures on the corresponding varieties.\n2.3. The structures of zero Kodaira dimension on varieties with a\npencil of complete intersections. In [1] a proof of the following fact was sketched.\nProposition 2.5. Let F \u2208 Freg be a smooth regular Fano complete intersection.\nThen any structure of a fiber space of relative Kodaira dimension zero \u03c7: F 99K W ,\n\u03ba(W/S) = 0, is a pencil: dim S = 1.\nRecall the main steps of the proof. Let W/S and \u03c7 be as above. Then the\npair (F, n1 \u03a3), where \u03a3 = (\u03c7\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03a3S \u2282 | \u2212 nKF |, is non-terminal (Proposition 2.2).\nHowever, it is canonical [1]. In the notations of the proof of Proposition 2.2, let\nE \u2282 Fe be a non-terminal singularity of the system \u03a3, that is, \u03bdE (\u03a3) = na(E),\nB = \u03c6(E) \u2282 F its center. If codim B \u2265 4 or codim B = 3, but the inequality\nmultB \u03a3 < 2n holds, then the technique of counting multiplicities [15] immediately\ngives the inequality\nmultB Z > 4n2 ,\n(10)\nwhere Z = (D1 \u25e6 D2 ) is the self-intersection of the linear system \u03a3, Di \u2208 \u03a3 are\ngeneral divisors. However, it was proved in [1, Sec. 2] that (10) is impossible.\nTherefore, either codim B = 3 and multB \u03a3 = 2n, or codim B = 2 and multB \u03a3 = n.\nIn any case the blow up of the subvariety B realizes a non-terminal singularity of the\nsystem \u03a3. If codim B = 2, then Z = n2 B, that is, the self-intersection of the system\n\u03a3 has no movable part. Thus the system \u03a3 is composed from a pencil, dim S = 1,\nas we claimed.\nTo complete the proof, it remains to exclude the first case when codim B = 3. It\ncan be done, using the technique of [1, Sec. 2]. For instance, if dk = max{di } \u2265 5,\n12\n\n\fthen the equality multB Z = 4n2 implies that for every point x \u2208 B each component\nof the effective cycle Z is of the form T1 \u2229 T2 , where T1 6= T2 are sections of F by\nhyperplanes, tangent to F at x. This is, of course, impossible (a section of F by any\nplane P \u2282 P of codimension two has at most a curve of singular points). Cheltsov\nnoted that it is easier to exclude the case codim B = 3, using the cone technique\n[15]. Namely, the following claim holds.\nLemma 2.1. For any irreducible subvariety Y \u2282 F of dimension k the inequality\nmultY \u03a3 \u2264 n holds.\nProof. Let x \u2208 P \\ F be a point of general position, C(x) \u2282 P the cone with\nthe vertex at x and the base Y . It is easy to see that C(x) \u2229 F = Y \u222a R(x), where\nR(x) \u2282 F is the residual curve. For a sufficiently general point x the curve R(x)\nis irreducible. The family of residual curves R(x) sweeps out F . At the points of\nintersection y \u2208 R(x) \u2229 Y the line Lx,y , connecting the points x and y, is tangent to\nF . Thus for a general point x \u2208 P\nR(x) \u2229 Sing Y = \u2205\n(by a trivial dimension count). Furthermore (see [15]),\n(R(x) * Y )C(x) = deg R(x).\nNow if multY \u03a3 > n, we immediately get a contradiction in exactly the same way\nas in [15] (computing the intersection index\n\u03a3y\u2208R(x)\u2229Y (R(x) * D)y\nfor a general divisor D \u2208 \u03a3). Q.E.D. for the lemma.\nProof of Proposition 2.5 is complete.\nThe arguments above extend immediately to the relative case.\nTheorem 4. Assume that the Fano fiber space V /P1 satisfies the following\nconditions:\n(i) Ft \u2208 Freg for any point t \u2208 P1 ,\n(ii) KV2 + 2HF 6\u2208 Int A2+ V ,\n(iii) \u2212KV 6\u2208 A1mov V .\nThen for every structure \u03c7: V 99K W of a fiber space of relative Kodaira dimension\nzero, \u03ba(W/S) = 0, we get dim S = 2, and moreover, the structure \u03c7 is compatible\nwith \u03c0, that is, there is a rational dominant map \u03bb: S 99K P1 such that \u03bb \u25e6 \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c7 = \u03c0.\nProof. If the structure \u03c7 is not compatible with \u03c0, we apply Proposition 2.4 and\nobtain a contradiction word for word as in the proof of Theorem 1. Therefore, the\nstructure \u03c7 is fiber-wise. Thus the problem is reduced to describing the structures of\nrelative Kodaira dimension zero on a fiber of general position, that is, to Proposition\n2.5?.\nQ.E.D. for the theorem.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\n1.
