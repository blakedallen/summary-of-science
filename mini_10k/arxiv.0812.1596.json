The correspondence between the f(R) geometrical effective energy density with the holographic density, allows the reconstruction of the f(R) gravity in flat FRW background in the Einstein frame. The proposed infrared cut-off for the holographic\nenergy density depends on two parameters which are fit using the luminosity\nversus redshift data, allowing a suitable reconstruction in two representative\ncases of the EoS parameter: for \u03c9 > \u22121 and \u03c9 < \u22121.\nPACS: 98.80.-k, 95.36.+x\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany astrophysical data, such as observations of large scale structure [1], searches\nfor type Ia supernovae [2], and measurements of the cosmic microwave background\nanisotropy [3], all indicate that the expansion of the universe is undergoing cosmic\nacceleration at the present time, due to some kind of negative-pressure form of matter\nknown as dark energy (for a review see[4],[5]). Although the cosmological observations\n\u2217\n\nngranda@univalle.edu.co\n\n1\n\n\fsuggest that dark energy component is about 2/3 of the total content of the universe,\nthe nature of the dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain unknown at\npresent. Among other approaches related with a variety of scalar fields (see [4]),\na very promising approach to dark energy is related with the modified theories of\ngravity known as f (R) gravity, in which dark energy emerges from the modification\nof geometry [6],[7],[8],[9],[10]. Modified gravity gives a natural unification of the earlytime inflation and late-time acceleration thanks to different role of gravitational terms\nrelevant at small and at large curvature and may naturally describe the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration in the cosmological dynamics. Among others, modified\ngravity is one of the areas of the gravitational science in which S. Odintsov has\ncontributed to develop thanks to a great number of pioneer investigations. Thus,\nthe connection of modified gravity theories with M-theory was suggested in [6] and\nsome explicit asymptotic examples were shown. In [7],[8],[11],[12],[13], a modified\ngravity model with positive and negative powers of curvature and ln R terms were\nproposed, to describe different unification scenarios of early time inflation with the\nlate-time cosmic acceleration. This unification was also studied with a Gauss-Bonnet\ninvariant dependent function as proposed in [14], [15]. The one-loop quantization\napproach to f (R) gravity was investigated in [16]. The asymptotic behavior of a wide\nvariety of f (R) models, for different cosmological epochs in the FRW background has\nbeen presented in [17] and a consistency with experimental tests has been studied\nin [17],[18],[19],[20]. A comprehensive work on reconstruction of different modified\nf (R) models, has been done trough the works [21],[22],[23],[24], [25], where it was\nexplicitly demonstrated which versions of above theories may be reconstructed from\nthe known universe expansion history (see also [10], [26], [27] for f (R) reconstruction).\nOther generalizations like a non-local model of f(R) gravity, non-minimal coupling of\nf(R) gravity with matter, with Maxwell theory and non-minimal Yang-Mills coupling\nwere discussed in [28, 29, 30, 31] respectively. The structure of future singularities\nin models of f (R) gravity consistent with local tests, have been worked in [32], [33],\nand the constraining of some f (R) models according to VIRGO, LIGO and LISA\nexperiments have been investigated in [34].\nAnother way to the solution of the dark energy problem within the fundamental theory\n2\n\n\fframework, is related with some facts of the quantum gravity theory, known as the\nholographic principle. Applied to the dark energy issue, this principle establishes an\ninfrared cut-off for the so called holographic energy density, related with cosmological\nscales (discussion and references are given in [35],[36]). An infrared cut-off given by\nthe future event horizon was proposed in [35] and a generalized holographic infrared\ncut-off depending on local and non-local quantities was proposed in [37]. Viewing the\nmodified f (R) gravity models as an effective description of the underlying theory of\ndark energy, and considering the holographic vacuum energy scenario as pointing in\nthe direction of the underlying theory of dark energy, it is interesting to study how\nthe f (R) gravity can describe the holographic energy density as an effective theory.\nThe reconstruction of f (R) theories under different conditions has been presented in\n[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] and the holographic reconstruction of f (R) gravity have\nbeen discussed in [27] with the infrared cut-off given by the future event horizon. In\nthis contribution, an holographic f (R) reconstruction using the new infrared cut-off\ngiven in [36, 38], is presented.\n\n2\n\nThe holographic model\n\nLet us start with the holographic dark energy density given by [36, 38]\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c1\u039b = 3Mp2 \u03b1H 2 + \u03b2 \u1e22\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter and \u03b1, \u03b2 are constants which must satisfy\nthe restrictions imposed by the current observational data. This kind of density\nmay appear as the simplest case of more general f (H, \u1e22) holographic density in\nthe FRW background. Note that this proposal avoids conflict with the causality.\nHere the constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 will be fixed according to the luminosity versus redshift\nobservational data as given in [39], based on [40] data. As we will focus on late\ntime reconstruction, we consider that the holographic dark energy density gives the\ndominant contribution to the Friedmann equation and neglect the contribution from\n\n3\n\n\fmatter and radiation, thus the Friedmann equation becomes simpler\nH2 =\n\n1\n\u03c1\u039b = \u03b1H 2 + \u03b2 \u1e22\n2\n3Mp\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich gives a power-law solution [38]\nH=\n\n\u03b2 1\n\u03b1\u22121t\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith constant equation of state parameter given by\n\u03c9\u039b = \u22121 +\n\n2\u03b1\u22121\n3 \u03b2\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn terms of the redshift parameter we can write H in Eq. (2.3) as follows\nH = H0 (1 + z)(\u03b1\u22121)/\u03b2\nwhere H0 =\n\n\u03b2 1\n\u03b1\u22121 t0\n\n(2.5)\n\nand t0 is the present time (z = 0). In the flat FRW background\n\nthe luminosity distance Ld can be written as [4]\nZ z\ndz\ndL = (1 + z)\n0 H(z)\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere we used the light speed c = 1. With H(z) given by (2.5) the luminosity distance\ntakes the explicit form from (2.6)\ndL (z) =\n\nh\ni\n1+z\n\u03b2\n(1 + z)(\u03b2\u2212\u03b1+1)/\u03b2 \u2212 1\nH0 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1 + 1\n\n(2.7)\n\nbased on this result we can plot the luminosity distance Ld in terms of the redshift,\nand tune the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 in such a way that may fit the data reconstructed\nplot as shown in [5] and [39]. The plot for three representative values of the \u03b1 and \u03b2\nparameters is given in Fig. 1\n\n4\n\n\f1.0\n\nlog10 @H0dLHzL\u0090cD\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\u0391=1.1 \u0392=0.5\n\n\u0391=1\n\n-1.0\n\n\u0391=0.95 \u0392=0.5\n-1.5\n\n-2.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nz\n\nFigure 1: The luminosity distance log10 (H0 dL (z)) versus redshift.

Variation with respect to the metric and setting aside the\ncomplications with the variations of f (R)-type actions leads to the field equation\n[33],[41]\n1\n(m)\n(3.2)\nf 0 (R)R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 f (R)g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003) f 0 (R) = \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nwhere \u2207\u03bc is the covariant derivative, prime denotes the derivative with respect to R\n(m)\n\nand T\u03bc\u03bd is the stress-energy tensor for the standard matter source. Interpreting this\n\n5\n\n\ffield equations in the form of Einstein equations with an effective stress-energy tensor\ncomposed of curvature terms moved to the right hand side, Eq. (3.2) can be written\nas (hereafter we will take \u03ba2 = 1)\n(m)\n\n1\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n(R)\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R = 0\n+ T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nf (R)\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n= 0\n(f (R) \u2212 Rf (R)) g\u03bc\u03bd + \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f (R) \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003f (R)\nf (R) 2\n\n(3.4)\n\n(R)\n\nwith T\u03bc\u03bd given by\n(R)\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n(R)\n\nwhere T\u03bc\u03bd may be defined as an effective stress-energy tensor for some kind of curvature fluid. This allows to put Eq. (3.4) in the form of a perfect fluid energy-momentum\ntensor, which will turn out to be useful in our reconstruction scheme. Note also that\nin this case the matter term becomes coupled to the geometry through f 0 (R).\nAssuming flat FRW background, the modified Friedmann equations take the form\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nRf 0 (R) \u2212 f (R)\n2\n00\nH = 0\n\u2212 3H \u1e58f (R)\n(3.5)\n\u03c1m +\n3f (R)\n2\nin this way we can define an effective curvature-density\n\u0014 0\n\u0015\n1\nRf (R) \u2212 f (R)\n00\n\u03c1R = 0\n\u2212 3H \u1e58f (R)\nf (R)\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe space-space components of (3.3) lead to the other Einstein equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n0\n2\n00\n2 000\n00\n2\u1e22 + 3H = \u2212 0\npm + R\u0308f (R) + \u1e58 f (R) + 2H \u1e58f (R) + (f (R) \u2212 Rf (R))\nf (R)\n2\n(3.7)\nwhich allows the identification of the effective curvature-pressure\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n00\n2 000\n00\n0\npR = 0\nR\u0308f (R) + \u1e58 f (R) + 2H \u1e58f (R) + (f (R) \u2212 Rf (R))\nf (R)\n2\n\n(3.8)\n\nHence, the curvature terms in the r.h.s. of Eqs. (3.6) and (3.8) can be viewed as an\neffective curvature-fluid with equation of state parameter expressed as\n\u03c9R = \u22121 + 2\n\nR\u0308f 00 (R) + \u1e582 f 000 (R) \u2212 H \u1e58f 00 (R)\nRf 0 (R) \u2212 f (R) \u2212 6H \u1e58f 00 (R)\n6\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fdefining the function \u03a6(R) = f 0 (R) [41] and combining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) it follows\nthat the EoS parameter for the curvature-fluid (3.9) can be written as\n\u03c9R = \u22121 +\n\n\u03a6\u0308 \u2212 H \u03a6\u0307\n3H 2 \u03a6 \u2212 \u03c1m\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere the last term \u03c1m is the pressureless dark matter contribution. According to\nthe holographic correspondence this EoS parameter should be equal to the one given\nby Eq. (2.4).

To determine f (R), we first reconstruct the form of f (R) from (3.14) as\na function of the redshift z.

Note also that our model is approximate as is obtained from\nreconstruction scheme and it is valid within the adopted approximation. It is not so\neasy to recover more realistic non-linear f(R) gravity which gives theory 3.18 as the\napproximation.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this work we showed a reconstruction of the late time cosmological f (R) gravity\ndynamics, based on the holographic energy density cut-off proposed in [36],[38]. An\nanalytical expression for the f (R) model compatible with observational data at low\nredshift has been found. The reconstructed Lagrangian is of a power-law type and\ncontains only positive curvature powers for \u03b1 > 1, \u03b2 > 0 (quintessence phase) and\nnegative curvature powers for \u03b1 < 1, \u03b2 > 0 (phantom phase), except in the region\n\u221a\n\u221a\nof parameters \u22123 \u2212 8 < \u03b2/(\u03b1 \u2212 1) < 8 \u2212 3, which is forbidden in this model\nas the power becomes complex. The \u03b1 < 1, \u03b2 < 0 can also be considered, giving\nsimilar to the case \u03b1 > 1, \u03b2 > 0 results. From equations (2.2) and (2.4) it follows\nthat for \u03b1 = 1 we obtain the de Sitter solution with \u03c9\u039b = \u22121. The last two terms\nin (3.18) correspond to the homogeneous solution of (3.11) with \u03a9m0 = 0, which\ndescribe a purely geometrical-dominance model of dark energy . For the specific case\nof \u03b1 = 1.1, \u03b2 = 0.5 we expect that the term with lower power R2\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n7/4\n\ndominates.\n\nThe matter dominance epoch occurs for p = 2/3, giving the Einstein term plus\ncorrections (this corrections may be caused due to the extrapolation to high redshift).\nIs important to note that the holographic dark energy density used here was obtained\nwithin the Einstein frame and not as the solution to the modified f (R) gravity. Hence\nthe reconstructed f (R) theory effectively describes the holographic dark energy in\nEinstein gravity. Nevertheless, Fig. 1 shows that the proposed solution (2.3) is a\ngood starting point, at least at the phenomenological level, to reconstruct the f (R)\nmodel at low redshift independent of the theory.\nIn summary, we have studied how the modified f (R) gravity model can be used to\ndescribe the holographic energy density as an effective theory at low redshift, which\n9\n\n\fconduces to the reconstruction in a direct and unambiguous way. However, this\nreconstruction is settled at the phenomenological level, and the theoretical root of\nthe holographic density still to be investigated.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Universidad del Valle.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
