Thesis is based on quantum electrodynamic (QED) bound-state calculations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], as well as on investigations related to divergent series,\nconvergence acceleration and applications of these concepts to physical problems [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,\n29, 30, 31].\nThe subjects which are discussed in this Thesis include: the self energy of a bound electron and the\nspin-dependence of QED corrections in bound systems (Chs. 1 \u2013 5), convergence acceleration techniques\n(Chs. 6 and 7), and resummation methods for divergent series with an emphasis on physical applications\n(Ch. 8).\nIn Chapter 1, we present numerical results [12], accurate to the level of 1 Hz for atomic hydrogen, for the\nenergy correction to the K and L shell states due to the one-loop self energy. We investigate hydrogenlike\nsystems with low nuclear charge number Z = 1\u20135. Calculations are carried out using on-mass shell\nrenormalization, which guarantees that the final result is written in terms of the physical electron charge.\nThe purpose of the calculation is twofold: first, we provide accurate theoretical predictions for the one-loop\nself energy of K and L shell states. Second, the comparison of the analytic and numerical approaches to\nthe Lamb shift calculations, which have followed separate paths for the past few decades, is demonstrated\nby comparing the numerical values with analytic data obtained using the Z\u03b1-expansion [1, 2, 32]. Our\ncalculation essentially eliminates the uncertainty due to the truncation of the Z\u03b1-expansion, and it\ndemonstrates the consistency of the numerical and analytic approaches which have attracted attention\nfor more than five decades, beginning with the seminal paper [33]. The most important numerical results\nare summarized in Table 1.5.\nIn Chapter 2, we investigate higher-order analytic calculations of the one-photon self energy for excited\natomic states. These calculations rely on mathematical methods described in Sec. 2.2 which, in physical\nterms, lead to a separation of the calculation into a high- and a low-energy part for the virtual photon.\nThis separation does not only permit adequate simplifications for the two energy regions [1, 2], but also\nan adequate treatment of the infrared divergences which plague all bound-state calculations (see also\nCh. 7 of [34]). The investigation represents a continuation of previous work on the subject [1, 2, 32]. The\ncalculations are relevant for transitions to highly excited states, which are relevant for the extraction\nof fundamental constants from the high-precision measurements in atomic hydrogen [35], and for the\nestimation of QED effects in more complex atomic systems where some of the electrons occupy highly\nexcited states.\nChapter 3. We investigate the two-loop self energy. The calculation is based on a generalization of the\nmethods introduced in Sec. 2.2. Historically, the two-loop self energy for bound states has represented a\nmajor task for theoretical evaluations. We present an analytic calculation [16] of the fine-structure difference of the two-loop self energy for P states in atomic hydrogen in the order \u03b12 (Z\u03b1)6 me c2 . This energy\ndifference can be parameterized by two analytic coefficients, known as B61 and B60 (see Sec. 3.2). These\ncoefficients describe the two-loop self energy in the sixth order in Z\u03b1, with an additional enhancement\ndue to a large logarithm ln[(Z\u03b1)\u22122 ] (in the case of the B61 -coefficient). The calculations are relevant for\nan improved theoretical understanding of the fine-structure in hydrogenlike systems. They are also in part\nrelevant for current experiments on atomic helium [36, 37, 38, 39], whose motivation is the determination\nof the fine-structure constant with improved accuracy. Finally, it is hoped that numerical calculations of\nthe two-loop effect will be carried out in the near future for which the current analytic evaluation will be\nan important consistency check. The calculation of the analytic corrections discussed in Sec. 3 represents\na solution for the most problematic set of diagrams on the way to advance our understanding of the\nfine-structure in atomic hydrogen to the few-Hz level. Explicit results for the fine-structure difference of\n5\n\n\fthe B61 - and B60 -coefficients can be found in Eqs. (3.59) \u2013 (3.64).\nIn Chapter 4, We investigate the spin-dependence of the Breit hamiltonian and quantum electrodynamic\neffects in general. Specifically, we consider a bound system of two spinless particles. The calculation is\nmotivated in part by current experiments (DIRAC at CERN) whose aim is the experimental study of\npionium, which is the bound system of two (spinless) oppositely charged pions. The evaluation of the\ntwo-body relativistic corrections of order (Z\u03b1)4 leads to a different result [17] than expected for a system\nof two spin-1/2 particles of equal mass, e.g. positronium. In particular, we conclude in Sec. 4.3 that\nthe so-called zitterbewegung term is absent for a system of two spinless particles (the absence of the\nzitterbewegung term in a bound system consisting of a spinless and a spin-1/2 particle was previously\npointed out in [40]). Final results for the relativistic correction, the vacuum polarization, and the self\nenergy of a system of two scalar particles can be found in Eqs. (4.15), (4.21) and (4.31). A summary of\nthe QED calculations is provided in Chapter 5.\nIn the second part of this Thesis, we discuss methods for accelerating the convergence of series, and for\nthe resummation of divergent series. As discussed in Chapter 6 and Sec. 7.1.1, convergence acceleration\nis essentially based on the idea that information hidden in trailing digits of elements of the sequence\ncan be used in order to make \"educated guesses\" regarding the remainder term, which can be used\nfor the construction of powerful sequence transformations (see Sec. 7.1.5). In Chapter 7, we discuss\nconvergence acceleration in detail. After a short overview of relevant mathematical methods (Sec. 7.1),\nwe discuss applications in applied biophysics (Sec. 7.2.1), in experimental mathematics (Sec. 7.2.2), and\nother applications, mainly in the evaluation of special functions (Sec. 7.2.3). In particular, Secs. 7.2.1 \u2013\n7.2.3 illustrate how the combined nonlinear-condensation transformation (CNCT) described in Sec. 7.1.6\ncan be used for the accelerated evaluation of nonalternating series, with an emphasis to applications of\npractical significance (Sec. 7.2.1).\nThe discussion on convergence acceleration in Ch. 7 is complemented in Chapter 8 by an overview of resummation techniques and relevant applications. Using the Stark effect and the associated autoionization\nwidth as a paradigmatic example, we discuss basic concepts like the Borel resummation method and its\ngeneralizations (Sec. 8.2.2), and the conformal mapping of the complex plane (Sec. 8.4). We then proceed\nto discuss further applications of resummation methods like zero-dimensional model theories (Sec. 8.3.1),\nthe QED effective action (expressed as a perturbation series in the fine structure constant, see Sec. 8.3.2),\nand the quantum-mechanical double-well problem (Sec. 8.3.3). Within the context of the double-well\nproblem, we perform an analytic evaluation of higher-order corrections to the two-instanton effect and\ndemonstrate the consistency of numerically determined energy levels with the instanton expansion.\nWe conclude with a summary of the results in Chapter 9, where we also explain the interrelations and\nconnections between the different subjects treated in this Thesis.\n\n6\n\n\fPart I\n\nQuantum Electrodynamic\nBound\u2013State Calculations\n\n7\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nNumerical Calculation of the\nOne\u2013Loop Self Energy (Excited\nStates)\n1.1\n\nOrientation\n\nA nonperturbative numerical evaluation of the one-photon electron self energy for the K- and L-shell\nstates of hydrogenlike ions with nuclear charge numbers Z = 1 to 5 is described. Our calculation for the\n1S1/2 state has a numerical uncertainty of 0.8 Hz in atomic hydrogen, and for the L-shell states (2S1/2 ,\n2P1/2 , and 2P3/2 ) the numerical uncertainty is 1.0 Hz. The method of evaluation for the ground state\nand for the excited states is described in detail. The numerical results are compared to results based on\nknown terms in the expansion of the self energy in powers of Z\u03b1.\n\n1.2\n\nIntroduction to the Numerical Calculation of Radiative Corrections\n\nThe nonperturbative numerical evaluation of radiative corrections to bound-state energy levels is interesting for two reasons. First, the recent dramatic increase in the accuracy of experiments that measure\nthe transition frequencies in hydrogen and deuterium [35, 41, 42] necessitates a numerical evaluation\n(nonperturbative in the binding Coulomb field) of the radiative corrections to the spectrum of atomic\nsystems with low nuclear charge Z. Second, the numerical calculation serves as an independent test of\nanalytic evaluations which are based on an expansion in the binding field with an expansion parameter\nZ\u03b1.\nIn order to address both issues, a high-precision numerical evaluation of the self energy of an electron\nin the ground state in hydrogenlike ions has been performed [9, 12, 43]. The approach outlined in [9] is\ngeneralized here to the L shell, and numerical results are obtained for the (n = 2) states 2S1/2 , 2P1/2 and\n2P3/2 . Results are provided for atomic hydrogen, He+ , Li2+ , Be3+ , and B4+ .\nIt has been pointed out in [9, 43] that the nonperturbative effects (in Z\u03b1) can be large even for low\nnuclear charge and exceed the current experimental accuracy for atomic transitions. For example, the\ndifference between the sum of the analytically evaluated terms up to the order of \u03b1 (Z\u03b1)6 and the final\nnumerical result for the ground state is roughly 27 kHz for atomic hydrogen and about 3200 kHz for He+ .\nFor the 2S state the difference is 3.5 kHz for atomic hydrogen and 412 kHz for He+ . The large difference\nbetween the result obtained by an expansion in Z\u03b1 persists even after the inclusion of a result recently\nobtained in [44] for the logarithmic term of order \u03b1 (Z\u03b1)7 ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 . For the ground state, the difference\nbetween the all-order numerical result and the sum of the perturbative terms is still 13 kHz for atomic\nhydrogen and 1600 kHz for He+ . For the 2 S state, the difference amounts to 1.6 kHz for atomic hydrogen\nand to 213 kHz for He+ .\n8\n\n\fThese figures should be compared to the current experimental precision. The most accurately measured\ntransition to date is the 1S\u20132S frequency in hydrogen; it has been measured with to a relative accuracy\nof 1.8 parts in 1014 or 46 Hz [42]. This experimental progress is due in part to the use of frequency\nchains that bridge the range between optical frequencies and the microwave cesium time standard. The\naccuracy of the measurement is likely to be improved by an order of magnitude in the near future [42, 45].\nWith trapped hydrogen atoms, it should be feasible to observe the 1S\u20132S frequency with an experimental\nlinewidth that approaches the 1.3 Hz natural width of the 2S level [46, 47].\nThe apparent convergence of the perturbation series in Z\u03b1 is slow. Our all-order numerical calculation\npresented here essentially eliminates the uncertainty from unevaluated higher-order analytic terms, and\nwe obtain results for the self energy remainder function GSE with a precision of roughly 0.8 \u00d7 Z 4 Hz for\nthe ground state of atomic hydrogen and 1.0 \u00d7 Z 4 Hz for the 2S state.\n\nIn the evaluation, we take advantage of resummation and convergence acceleration techniques. The resummation techniques provide an efficient method of evaluation of the Dirac-Coulomb Green function to\na relative accuracy of 10\u221224 over a wide parameter range [43]. The convergence acceleration techniques\nremove the principal numerical difficulties associated with the singularity of the relativistic propagators\nfor nearly equal radial arguments [23].\nThe one-photon self energy is about two orders of magnitude larger than the other contributions to\nthe Lamb shift in atomic hydrogen. Comprehensive reviews of the various contributions to the Lamb\nshift in hydrogenlike atoms in the full range of nuclear charge numbers Z = 1\u2013110 have been given in\nRefs. [48, 49, 50, 51].\n\n1.3\n1.3.1\n\nMethod of Evaluation\nStatus of Analytic Calculations\n\nThe (real part of the) energy shift \u2206ESE due to the electron self energy radiative correction is usually\nwritten as\n\u03b1 (Z\u03b1)4\nF (nlj , Z\u03b1) me c2\n(1.1)\n\u2206ESE =\n\u03c0 n3\nwhere F is a dimensionless quantity. In the following, the natural unit system with ~ = c = me = 1 and\ne2 = 4\u03c0\u03b1 is employed. Note that F (nlj , Z\u03b1) is a dimensionless function which depends for a given atomic\nstate with quantum numbers n, l and j on only one argument (the coupling Z\u03b1). For excited states,\nthe (nonvanishing) imaginary part of the self energy is proportional to the (spontaneous) decay width of\nthe state. We will denote here the real part of the self energy by \u2206ESE , exclusively. The semi-analytic\nexpansion of F (nlj , Z\u03b1) about Z\u03b1 = 0 for a general atomic state with quantum numbers n, l and j gives\nrise to the expression,\nF (nlj , Z\u03b1) =\n\nA41 (nlj ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122\n\n+A40 (nlj ) + (Z\u03b1) A50 (nlj )\n\u0002\n+ (Z\u03b1)2 A62 (nlj ) ln2 (Z\u03b1)\u22122\n\u0003\n+A61 (nlj ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + GSE (nlj , Z\u03b1) .\n\n(1.2)\n\nFor particular states, some of the coefficients may vanish. Notably, this is the case for P states, which are\nless singular than S states at the origin [see Eq. (1.4) below]. For the nS1/2 state (l = 0, j = 1/2), none\n\n9\n\n\fof the terms in Eq. (1.2) vanishes, and we have,\nF (nS1/2 , Z\u03b1) = A41 (nS1/2 ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122\n\n+A40 (nS1/2 ) + (Z\u03b1) A50 (nS1/2 )\n\u0002\n+ (Z\u03b1)2 A62 (nS1/2 ) ln2 (Z\u03b1)\u22122\n\u0003\n+A61 (nS1/2 ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + GSE (nS1/2 , Z\u03b1) .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe A coefficients have two indices, the first of which denotes the power of Z\u03b1 [including those powers\nimplicitly contained in Eq. (1.1)], while the second index denotes the power of the logarithm ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 .\nFor P states, the coefficients A41 , A50 and A62 vanish, and we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(1.4)\nF (nPj , Z\u03b1) = A40 (nPj ) + (Z\u03b1)2 A61 (nPj ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + GSE (nPj , Z\u03b1) .\n\nFor S states, the self energy remainder function GSE can be expanded semi-analytically as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nGSE (nS1/2 , Z\u03b1) = A60 (nS1/2 ) + (Z\u03b1) A71 (nS1/2 ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + A70 (nS1/2 ) + o(Z\u03b1) .\n\n(1.5)\n\nFor the \"order\" symbols o and O we follow the usual convention [52, 53]: the requirement is O(x)/x \u2192\nconst. as x \u2192 0, whereas o(x) fulfills the weaker requirement o(x) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0. For example, the\nexpression [(Z\u03b1) ln(Z\u03b1)] is o(Z\u03b1) but not O(Z\u03b1). Because logarithmic terms corresponding to a nonvanishing A83 -coefficient must be expected in Eq. (1.5), the symbol o(Z\u03b1) should be used to characterize\nthe remainder, not O(Z\u03b1).\nFor P states, the semi-analytic expansion of GSE reads\nGSE (nPj , Z\u03b1) = A60 (nPj )(Z\u03b1) [A70 (nPj ) + o(Z\u03b1)] .\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe fact that A71 (nPj ) vanishes has been pointed out in [44]. We list below the analytic coefficients\nand the Bethe logarithms relevant to the atomic states under investigation. For the ground state, the\ncoefficients A41 and A40 were obtained in [33, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], the correction term A50 was found\nin [60, 61, 62], and the higher-order binding corrections A62 and A61 were evaluated in [32, 63, 64, 65,\n66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]. The results are,\nA41 (1S1/2 ) =\n\n4\n,\n3\n\nA40 (1S1/2 ) =\n\n10 4\n\u2212 ln k0 (1S) ,\n9\n3\n\nA50 (1S1/2 ) =\n\n4\u03c0\n\nA62 (1S1/2 ) =\n\n\u22121 ,\n\nA61 (1S1/2 ) =\n\n21\n28\nln 2 \u2212\n.\n3\n20\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n139 1\n\u2212 ln 2 ,\n128 2\n\n(1.7)\n\nThe Bethe logarithm ln k0 (1S) has been evaluated in [72] and [73, 74, 75, 76, 77] as\nln k0 (1S) = 2.984 128 555 8(3).\n\n10\n\n(1.8)\n\n\fFor the 2S state, we have\nA41 (2S1/2 ) =\n\n4\n,\n3\n\nA40 (2S1/2 ) =\n\n10 4\n\u2212 ln k0 (2S) ,\n9\n3\n\nA50 (2S1/2 ) =\n\n4\u03c0\n\nA62 (2S1/2 ) =\n\n\u22121 ,\n\nA61 (2S1/2 ) =\n\n67\n16\nln 2 +\n.\n3\n30\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n139 1\n\u2212 ln 2 ,\n128 2\n\n(1.9)\n\nThe Bethe logarithm ln k0 (2S) has been evaluated (see [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77], the results exhibit varying\naccuracy) as\nln k0 (2S) = 2.811 769 893(3).\n(1.10)\nIt might be worth noting that the value for ln k0 (2S) given in [78] evidently contains a typographical error.\nOur independent re-evaluation confirms the result given in Eq. (1.10), which was originally obtained in [72]\nto the required precision. For the 2P1/2 state we have\nA40 (2P1/2 )\n\n1 4\n= \u2212 \u2212 ln k0 (2P) ,\n6 3\n\nA61 (2P1/2 )\n\n=\n\n103\n.\n108\n\n(1.11)\n\nNote that a general analytic result for the logarithmic correction A61 as a function of the bound state\nquantum numbers n, l and j can be inferred from Eq. (4.4a) of [68, 69] upon subtraction of the vacuum\npolarization contribution implicitly contained in the quoted equation. The Bethe logarithm for the 2P\nstates reads [72, 79]\nln k0 (2P) = \u22120.030 016 708 9(3) .\n(1.12)\n\nBecause the Bethe logarithm is an inherently nonrelativistic quantity, it is spin-independent and therefore\nindependent of the total angular momentum j for a given orbital angular momentum l. For the 2P3/2\nstate the analytic coefficients are\nA40 (2P3/2 ) =\n\n1\n4\n\u2212 ln k0 (2P) ,\n12 3\n\nA61 (2P3/2 ) =\n\n29\n.\n90\n\n(1.13)\n\nWe now consider the limit of the function GSE (Z\u03b1) as Z\u03b1 \u2192 0. The higher-order terms in the potential\nexpansion (see Fig. 1.3 below) and relativistic corrections to the wavefunction both generate terms of\nhigher order in Z\u03b1 which are manifest in Eq. (1.2) in the form of the nonvanishing function GSE (Z\u03b1)\nwhich summarizes the effects of the relativistic corrections to the bound electron wave function and of\nhigher-order terms in the potential expansion. For very soft virtual photons, the potential expansion fails\nand generates an infrared divergence which is cut off by the atomic momentum scale, Z\u03b1. This cut-off\nfor the infrared divergence is one of the mechanisms which lead to the logarithmic terms in Eq. (1.2).\nSome of the nonlogarithmic terms in relative order (Z\u03b1)2 in Eq. (1.2) are generated by the relativistic\ncorrections to the wave function. The function GSE does not vanish, but approaches a constant in the\nlimit Z\u03b1 \u2192 0. This constant can be determined by analytic or semi-analytic calculations; it is referred\nto as the A60 coefficient, i.e.\nA60 (nlj ) = GSE (nlj , 0) .\n(1.14)\n11\n\n\fThe evaluation of the coefficient A60 (1S1/2 ) has drawn a lot of attention for a long time [32, 68, 69, 70, 71].\nFor the 2S state, there is currently only one accurate analytic result available,\nA60 (2S1/2 ) = \u221231.840 47(1)\n\n(see Ref. [32]).\n\n(1.15)\n\n(see Ref. [1]),\n\n(1.16)\n\n(see Ref. [1]),\n\n(1.17)\n\nFor the 2P1/2 state, the analytically obtained result is\nA60 (2P1/2 ) = \u22120.998 91(1)\nand for the 2P3/2 state, we have\nA60 (2P3/2 ) = \u22120.503 37(1)\n\nThe analytic evaluations essentially rely on an expansion of the relativistic Dirac-Coulomb propagator\nin powers of the binding field, i.e. in powers of Coulomb interactions of the electron with the nucleus. In\nnumerical evaluations, the binding field is treated nonperturbatively, and no expansion is performed.\n\n1.3.2\n\nFormulation of the Numerical Problem\n\nNumerical cancellations are severe for small nuclear charges. In order to understand the origin of the\nnumerical cancellations it is necessary to consider the renormalization of the self energy. The renormalization procedure postulates that the self energy is essentially the effect on the bound electron due to the\nself interaction with its own radiation field, minus the same effect on a free electron which is absorbed\nin the mass of the electron and therefore not observable. The self energy of the bound electron is the\nresidual effect obtained after the subtraction of two large quantities. Terms associated with renormalization counterterms are of order 1 in the Z\u03b1-expansion, whereas the residual effect is of order (Z\u03b1)4 [see\nEq. (1.1)]. This corresponds to a loss of roughly 9 significant digits at Z = 1. Consequently, even the\nprecise evaluation of the one-photon self energy in a Coulomb field presented in [80] extends only down\nto Z = 5. Among the self energy corrections in one-loop and higher-loop order, numerical cancellations\nin absolute terms are most severe for the one-loop problem because of the large size of the effect of the\none-loop self energy correction on the spectrum.\nFor our high-precision numerical evaluation, we start from the regularized and renormalized expression\nfor the one-loop self energy of a bound electron,\n\u001a\nZ 3\nZ\nd k\nd\u03c9\nD\u03bc\u03bd (k 2 , \u039b)\n\u2206ESE = lim i e2 Re\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\n(2\u03c0)3\nCF 2\u03c0\n\u001c\n\u00d7 \u03c8\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc\n\n1\n\u03b3\u03bd \u03c8\n6 p\u2212 6 k \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b3 0 V\n\n\u001d\n\n\u2212 \u2206m\n\n\u001b\n\n\u001a\nZ 3\nZ\nd k\nd\u03c9\n2\nD\u03bc\u03bd (k 2 , \u039b)\n= lim \u2212i e Re\n3\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\n2\u03c0\n(2\u03c0)\nC\n\u03bc\n\n\u00d7 \u03c8 \u03b1 e\n\nik*x\n\n\u03bd\n\nG(En \u2212 \u03c9) \u03b1 e\n\n\u2212ik*x\n\n\u001b\n\n\u03c8 \u2212 \u2206m ,\n\n(1.18)\n\nwhere G denotes the Dirac-Coulomb propagator,\nG(z) =\n\n1\n,\n\u03b1*p+\u03b2+V \u2212z\n\nand \u2206m is the \u039b-dependent (cutoff-dependent) one-loop mass-counter term,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n\u03b1 3\n2\nh\u03b2i .\nln \u039b +\n\u2206m =\n\u03c0 4\n8\n12\n\n(1.19)\n\n(1.20)\n\n\f!\n\nIm( )\n\n6\n6CH\n\n\u0013\u0012\u001b\n\nCL\n\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\n\nEn\n\nm\n\n2\n\n!-\n\nRe( )\n\nCL\n\n6CH\n\nFigure 1.1: Integration contour C for the integration over the energy \u03c9 = En \u2212 z of the\nvirtual photon.

The\nenergy variable z in Eq. (1.19) therefore assumes the value\nz = En \u2212 \u03c9 ,\n\n(1.22)\n\nwhere En is the Dirac energy of the atomic state, and \u03c9 denotes the complex-valued energy of the virtual\nphoton. It is understood that the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e is taken after all integrals in Eq.

The integrations along the lowenergy contour CL and the high-energy contour CH in Fig. 1.1 give rise to the low- and the high-energy\ncontributions \u2206EL and \u2206EH to the self energy, respectively. Here, we employ a further separation of the\nlow-energy integration contour CL into an infrared contour CIR and a middle-energy contour CM shown\nin Fig. 1.2. This separation gives rise to a separation of the low-energy part \u2206EL into the infrared part\n\u2206EIR and the middle-energy part \u2206EM ,\n\u2206EL = \u2206EIR + \u2206EM .\n\n(1.23)\n\nFor the low-Z systems discussed here, all complications which arise for excited states due to the decay\ninto the ground state are relevant only for the infrared part.

We recover the middle-energy term as the\nsum\nFM (nlj , Z\u03b1) = FMA (nlj , Z\u03b1) + FMB (nlj , Z\u03b1) .\n(1.27)\nA similar separation is employed for the high-energy part. The high-energy part is divided into a subtraction term FHA , which is evaluated in Sec. 1.5.1, and the high-energy remainder FHB , which is discussed\n14\n\n\fin Sec. 1.5.2. The sum of the subtraction term and the remainder is\nFH (nlj , Z\u03b1) = FHA (nlj , Z\u03b1) + FHB (nlj , Z\u03b1) .\n\n(1.28)\n\nThe total energy shift is given as\n\u2206ESE\n\n= \u2206EIR + \u2206EM + EH \u2212 \u2206m\n\u03b1 (Z\u03b1)4\n[FIR (nlj , Z\u03b1) + FM (nlj , Z\u03b1) + FH (nlj , Z\u03b1)] .\n\u03c0 n3\n\n=\n\n(1.29)\n\nThe scaled self energy function F defined in Eq.

(1.19), fulfill the following identity which is of particular\nimportance for the validity of the method used in the numerical evaluation of the all-order binding\ncorrection to the Lamb shift,\nG = F \u2212 F V F + F V GV F .\n(1.34)\nThis identity leads naturally to a separation of the one-photon self energy into a zero-vertex, a singlevertex and a many-vertex term. This is represented diagrammatically in Fig. 1.3.\nAll ultraviolet divergences which occur in the one-photon problem (mass counter term and vertex divergence) are generated by the zero-vertex and the single-vertex terms. The many-vertex term is ultraviolet\nsafe. Of crucial importance is the observation that one may additionally simplify the problem by replacing the one-potential term with an approximate expression in which the potential is \"commuted to the\noutside\". The approximate expression generates all divergences and all terms of lower order than \u03b1 (Z\u03b1)4\npresent in the one-vertex term. Unlike the raw one-potential term, it is amenable to significant further\nsimplification and can be reduced to one-dimensional numerical integrals which can be evaluated easily\n(a straightforward formulation of the self energy problem requires a three-dimensional numerical integration). Without this significant improvement, an all-order calculation would be much more difficult at low\nnuclear charge, because the lower-order terms would introduce significant further numerical cancellations.\nFurthermore, the special approximate resolvent can be used effectively for an efficient subtraction scheme\nin the middle-energy part of the calculation. In the infrared part, such a subtraction is not used because\nit would introduce infrared divergences.\nWe now turn to the construction of the special approximate resolvent, which will be referred to as GA\nand will be used in this calculation to isolate the ultraviolet divergences in the high-energy part (and\nto provide subtraction terms in the middle-energy part). It is based on an approximation to the first\n15\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\n\u0003\u0004\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 1.3: The exact expansion of the bound electron propagator in powers of the binding\nfield leads to a zero-potential, a one-potential and a many-potential term.

Evaluation of the integral over\n18\n\n\fz is facilitated by the subtraction of those terms which generate the singularities along the integration\ncontour (for higher excited states, there can be numerous bound state poles, as pointed out in [2, 85]).\nFor the 2S and 2P1/2 states, only the pole contribution from the ground state must be subtracted. For the\n2P3/2 state, pole contributions originating from the 1S, the 2S and the 2P1/2 states must be taken into\naccount. The numerical evaluation of the subtracted integrand proceeds along ideas outlined in [83, 85]\nand is not discussed here in any further detail.\nThe scaling parameter a for the integration over y is chosen to simplify the exponential dependence of\nthe function S defined in Eq.

The calculations are performed with the\nnumerical value of \u03b1\u22121 = 137.036 for the fine structure constant.\n\nThe sum over |\u03ba| in Eq. (1.50) is carried out locally, i.e. for each set of arguments r, y, z. The sum over\n|\u03ba| is absolutely convergent. For |\u03ba| \u2192 \u221e, the convergence of the sum is governed by the asymptotic\nbehavior of the Bessel functions which occur in the photon functions Aij\n\u03ba (i, j = 1, 2) [see Eqs. (3.15) and\n(3.16) in [81]]. The photon functions contain products of two Bessel functions of the form Jl (\u03c12/1 ) where\n19\n\n\fJl stands for either jl or jl\u2032 , the index l is in the range l \u2208 {|\u03ba| \u2212 1, |\u03ba|, |\u03ba| + 1}. The argument is either\n\u03c12 = (En \u2212 z) x2 or \u03c11 = (En \u2212 z) x1 . The asymptotic behavior of the two relevant Bessel functions for\nlarge l (and therefore large |\u03ba|) is\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nxl\n1\nl\n\u2032\n1+O\nand\n(1.54)\njl (x) =\nx (2l + 1)!!\nl\njl (x)\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nxl\n1\n1+O\n.\n(2l + 1)!!\nl\n\n(1.55)\n\nThis implies that when min{\u03c12 , \u03c11 } = \u03c12 < l, the function Jl (\u03c12 ) vanishes with increasing l approximately\nas (e \u03c12 /2l)l . This rapidly converging asymptotic behavior sets in as soon as l \u2248 |\u03ba| > \u03c12 = r \u03c9 y/a [see\nEqs. (1.22) and (1.51)]. Due to the rapid convergence for |\u03ba| > \u03c12 , the maximum angular momentum\nquantum number |\u03ba| in the numerical calculation of the infrared part is less than 3 000. Note that because\nz \u2208 (9/10 En , En ) in the infrared part, \u03c9 < 1/10 En .\nThe integration scheme is based on a crude estimate of the dependence of the integrand SIR (r, y, z) defined\nin Eq. (1.50) on the integration variables r, y and z. The main contribution to the integral is given by\nthe region where the arguments of the Whittaker functions as they occur in the Green function [see\nEq. (A.16) in [81]] are much larger than the Dirac angular momentum,\ny\n2 c \u226b |\u03ba|\na\n(see also p. 56 of [82]). We assume the asymptotic form of the Green function given in Eq. (A.3) in [82]\napplies and attribute a factor\nexp[\u2212(1 \u2212 r) c y/a]\nto the radial Green functions Gij\n\u03ba as they occur in Eq. (1.50). Note that relatively slowly varying factors\nare replaced by unity. The products of the radial wave functions f\u0131\u0304 and f\uf6be\u0304 , according to the discussion\nfollowing Eq. (1.53), behave as\n\u0002\n\u0003\ne\u2212y exp 1/2 (1 \u2212 r) y\nfor large y. The photon functions Aij\n\u03ba in Eq.

The calculation was parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI)\nand carried out on a cluster of Silicon Graphics workstations and on an IBM 9276 SP/2 multiprocessor\nsystem.

We define the middle-energy subtraction term FMA as the expression obtained upon\nsubstitution of the propagator GA for G in Eq. (1.59). The propagator GB is simply calculated as the\ndifference of G and GA [see Eq. (1.39)]. A substitution of the propagator GB for G in Eq.

Details of the\nintegration procedure are provided in [43]. Numerical results for the middle-energy remainder FMB , are\nsummarized in Table 1.2 for the K- and L-shell states.\nFor the middle-energy part, the separation into a subtraction and a remainder term has considerable\ncomputational advantages which become obvious upon inspection of Eqs. (1.68) and (1.72). The subtraction involves a propagator whose angular components can be evaluated by recursion [43, 82], which\nis computationally time-consuming. Because the subtraction term involves lower-order components [see\nEq. (1.25)], it has to be evaluated to high precision numerically (in a typical case, a relative accuracy\nof 10\u221219 is required). This high precision requires in turn a large number of integration points for the\nGaussian quadratures, which is possible only if the numerical evaluation of the integrand is not computationally time-consuming. For the remainder term, no lower-order terms have to be subtracted, and the\nrelative accuracy required of the integrals is in the range of 10\u221211 . . . 10\u22129 . A numerical evaluation to this\n23\n\n\fsmaller level of precision is feasible although the calculation of the Green function GB is computationally\nmore expensive than that of GA [43, 81, 82]. The separation of the high-energy part into a subtraction\nterm and a remainder term, which is discussed in Sec. 1.5, is motivated by analogous considerations as\nfor the middle-energy part. In the high-energy part, this separation is even more important than in the\nmiddle-energy part, because of the occurrence of infinite terms which need to be subtracted analytically\nbefore a numerical evaluation can proceed [see Eq. (1.82) below].\nWe now summarize the results for the middle-energy part. The middle-energy part is the sum of the\nmiddle-energy subtraction term FMA and the middle-energy remainder FMB [see also Eq. (1.27)]. Numerical results are summarized in Table 1.2 for the K- and L-shell states.

We\nfocus instead on the convergence acceleration technique used in the evaluation.\nIn analogy with the middle-energy remainder, we may write the integrand SHB which is defined in\ncomplete analogy to (1.70) as a sum over angular momenta (\"partial waves\")\nSHB \u221d\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nTHB,|\u03ba| ,\n\n(1.91)\n\n|\u03ba|=1\n\nwhere the THB,|\u03ba| are defined in analogy to Eq.

The asymptotic behaviour of the\nTHB,|\u03ba| for large |\u03ba| is [see Eq.

The series in Eq.

The combined transformation (combination of\nthe condensation transformation and the Weniger transformation) was found to be applicable to a wide\nrange of slowly convergent monotone series (series whose terms have the same sign), and many examples\nfor its application were given in Ref. [23, 31]. For the numerical treatment of radiative corrections in low-Z\nsystems, the transformation has the advantage of removing the principal numerical difficulties associated\nwith the slow convergence of angular momentum decompositions of the propagators near their singularity\nfor equal radial arguments.\nAll that remains to be discussed in the current section is the low-Z limit of the energy shift\n\u2206EHB =\n\n\u03b1 (Z\u03b1)4\nFHB (nlj , Z\u03b1) .\n\u03c0 n3\n\n(1.93)\n\nFor the high-energy remainder FHB , the limits as Z\u03b1 \u2192 0 read [see Eq.

(1.1)\nare given in Table 1.5, together with the results for the nonperturbative function GSE (nlj , Z\u03b1), which is\nimplicitly defined in Eq. (1.2). Results are provided for K and L shell states. The numerical results for\nthe remainder GSE are obtained by subtracting the analytic lower-order terms listed in Eq. (1.2) from\nthe complete numerical result for the scaled function F (nlj , Z\u03b1). No additional fitting is performed.\nAnalytic and numerical results at low Z can be compared by considering the remainder function GSE . Note\nthat an inconsistency in any of the analytically obtained lower-order terms would be likely to manifest\nitself in a grossly inconsistent dependence of GSE (nlj , Z\u03b1) on its argument Z\u03b1; this is not observed.\nFor S states, the following analytic model for GSE is commonly assumed, which is motivated in part\nby a renormalization-group analysis [87] and is constructed in analogy with the pattern of the analytic\ncoefficients Aij in Eq. (1.2) and (1.3),\n\u0002\n\u0003\nGSE (nS1/2 , Z\u03b1) = A60 (nS1/2 ) + (Z\u03b1) A71 (nS1/2 ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + A70 (nS1/2 )\n\u0002\n+(Z\u03b1)2 A83 (nS1/2 ) ln3 (Z\u03b1)\u22122 + A82 (nS1/2 ) ln2 (Z\u03b1)\u22122\n\u0003\n+A81 (nS1/2 ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + A80 (nS1/2 ) .\n29\n\n(1.99)\n\n\fThe (probably nonvanishing) A83 coefficient, which introduces a triple logarithmic singularity at Z\u03b1 = 0,\nhinders an accurate comparison of numerical and analytic data for GSE .

This will be explained in the sequel.\nnum\nWe denote the analytic and numerical limits of \u2206GSE (Z\u03b1) as Z\u03b1 \u2192 0 as \u2206Aana\n60 and \u2206A60 , respectively.\nOf course, we hope that these will turn out to be equal. However, we temporarily leave open the possibility\nof an inconsistency between numerical and analytic data by keeping \u2206Anum\nand \u2206Aana\n60\n60 as distinct\nvariables. In order to illustrate how a discrepancy could be detected by investigating the function g(Z),\nwe consider special cases of the function \u2206GSE (Z\u03b1) and g(Z). For Z = 0, the exact result can be inferred\nexclusively and uniquely using the analytic approach of Ref. [32], and we have\n\n\u2206GSE (0) = \u2206Aana\n60 ,\n\n(1.106)\n\nwhereas for Z = 1, which is determined by numerical data,\n\u2206GSE (\u03b1) \u2248 \u2206Anum\n60 + \u03b1 \u2206A70 ,\n\n(1.107)\n\nwith a possibly different limit \u2206Anum\nas Z \u2192 0, and for Z = 2,\n60\n\u2206GSE (2\u03b1) \u2248 \u2206Anum\n60 + 2 \u03b1 \u2206A70 ,\n\n(1.108)\n\nwhere we ignore higher-order analytic terms. Hence, for Z = 0, we have\nana\ng(0) = \u2206GSE (\u03b1) \u2212 \u2206GSE (0) = \u2206Anum\n60 \u2212 \u2206A60 + \u03b1 [\u2206A70 + o(Z\u03b1)] .\n\n(1.109)\n\nana\nA possible inconsistency (nonvanishing \u2206Anum\n60 \u2212 \u2206A60 ) would influence the value of g(0). For Z = 1,\nthe value of g is determined solely by numerical data,\n\ng(1) = \u2206GSE (2\u03b1) \u2212 \u2206GSE (\u03b1) = \u03b1 [\u2206A70 + o(Z\u03b1)] ,\n\n(1.110)\n\ng(2) = \u2206GSE (3\u03b1) \u2212 \u2206GSE (2\u03b1) = \u03b1 [\u2206A70 + o(Z\u03b1)] .\n\n(1.111)\n\nand for Z = 2, we have\n\n30\n\n\fOf course, analogous relations hold for Z > 2. This means that a meaningful comparison of the analytic\nand numerical approaches can be made by comparing the value g(0), which is influenced by the term\nana\nnum\nana\n\u2206Anum\n60 \u2212\u2206A60 , to the other values g(1), . . . , g(4), which are independent of the difference \u2206A60 \u2212\u2206A60 .\nWe recall that the numerical data from Table 1.5 lead to the evaluation of the five values g(0), g(1), g(2),\ng(3) and g(4). A plot of the function g(Z) serves two purposes: (i) the values g(1), . . . , g(4) should exhibit\napparent convergence to some limiting value \u03b1 \u2206A70 as Z \u2192 0, and this can be verified by inspection\nof the plot, and (ii) a discrepancy between the analytic and numerical approaches \u2013 as explained above\n\u2013 would result in a nonvanishing value for \u2206Anum\n\u2212 \u2206Aana\n60\n60 , and it would introduce an inconsistency\nbetween the trend in the values of g(1), . . . , g(4), and the value of g(0) [see Eq.

For the evaluation of the data point at Z = 0, a value of\nA60 (1S1/2 ) = \u221230.92415(1) is employed [9, 32, 88].\n\n31\n\n\fAmong the different evaluations of A60 for the ground state, the result in [32] has the smallest quoted\nuncertainty. In Fig. 1.4 we display a plot of g(Z) for low nuclear charge Z. A value of A60 (1S1/2 ) =\nAana\n60 (1S1/2 ) = \u221230.92415(1) [9, 32, 88] is used in Fig. 1.4. The results indicate very good agreement\nbetween the numerical and analytic approaches to the Lamb shift in the low-Z region up to the level of\na few Hz in frequency units for the low-lying atomic states (where n is the principal quantum number).\nThe error bars represent the numerical uncertainty of the values in Table 1.5, which correspond to an\nuncertainty on the level of 1.0 \u00d7 Z 4 Hz in frequency units.\nAnalytic work on the correction A60 has extended over three decades [32, 68, 69, 70, 71]. The complication\narises that although the calculations are in general analytic, some remaining one-dimensional integrations\ncould not be evaluated analytically because of the nature of the integrals [see e.g. Eq. (6.96) in [32]].\nTherefore a step-by-step comparison of the analytic calculations is difficult. An additional difficulty is the\nisolation of those analytic terms which contribute in a given order in Z\u03b1, i.e. the isolation of only those\nterms which contribute to A60 . The apparent consistency of the numerical and analytic data in Fig. 1.4\nrepresents an independent consistency check on the rather involved analytic calculations.\n0.028\n0.027\n0.026\n\ng1/2(Z)\n\n0.025\n0.024\n0.023\n0.022\n0.021\n0.020\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\nZ\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 1.5: Comparison of numerical data and analytically evaluated higherorder binding corrections for the 2P1/2 state. We plot the function g1/2 (Z)\ndefined in Eq. (1.114) in the region of low Z. The numerical data appear to\nbe consistent with the analytic result of A60 (2P1/2 ) = \u22120.99891(1) obtained\nin [1].\n\nOur numerical results are not inconsistent with the analytic result [44] for a higher-order logarithm,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n139\nA71 = \u03c0\n\u2212 ln 2 = 4.65,\n(1.112)\n64\nalthough they do not necessarily confirm it. As in [9], we obtain as an estimate A71 = 5.5(1.0) (from the fit\nto the numerical data for both S states). Logarithmic terms corresponding to the probably nonvanishing\nA83 coefficient should be taken into account for a consistent fit of the corrections to GSE . These highly\nsingular terms are difficult to handle with a numerical fitting procedure. The terms A83 , A82 and A81\nfurnish three more free parameters for the numerical fit, where only five data points are available (in\naddition to the quantities A60 , A71 and A70 , which may also be regarded as free parameters for the\nfitting procedure). The determination of A60 by a fit from the numerical data is much more stable\nthan the determination of the logarithmic correction A71 . We briefly note that our all-order evaluation\nessentially eliminates the uncertainty due to the unknown higher-order analytic terms. It is interesting\nto note that the same numerical methods are employed for both the S and P states in our all-order (in\nZ\u03b1) calculation, whereas the analytic treatment of S and P states differs [1, 32].\nThe comparison of numerical and analytic result is much less problematic for P states, because the\nfunction GSE is less singular [see Eqs. (1.4) and (1.6)]. For the 2P states, we observe that the function\n32\n\n\fGSE (2Pj , Z\u03b1) has the same semi-analytic expansion about Z\u03b1 = 0 as the function \u2206GSE (Z\u03b1) defined\nfor S states in Eq. (1.100). We have\n\u0002\nGSE (2Pj , Z\u03b1) = A60 (2Pj ) + (Z\u03b1) A70 (2Pj ) + (Z\u03b1)2 A82 (2Pj ) ln2 (Z\u03b1)\u22122\n\nHence, we plot the function\n\n\u0003\n+A81 (2Pj ) ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122 + A80 (2Pj ) + o(Z\u03b1) .\ngj (Z) = GSE (2Pj , (Z + 1) \u03b1) \u2212 GSE (2Pj , Z\u03b1)\n\n(1.113)\n\n(1.114)\n\nfor j = 1/2 in the region of low Z, with the notion that an inconsistent analytic result for A60 (2Pj ) would\nlead to irregularity at Z = 0, in analogy with the S states. The numerical data shown in Fig. 1.5 appears\nto be consistent with the analytic results of\nA60 (2P1/2 ) = \u22120.998 91(1) .\n\n(1.115)\n\nobtained in [1]. For the 2P3/2 state, see Fig. 6 of Ref. [12]. In this context it may be interesting to note\nthat analytic results obtained in [1, 2] for the higher-order binding corrections to 2P, 3P and 4P states\nhave recently been confirmed indirectly [89].\n\n33\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nAnalytic Self\u2013Energy Calculations\nfor Excited States\n2.1\n\nOrientation\n\nAnalytic calculations of the one-loop self energy in bound systems have a long history, starting from\nBethe's seminal paper [33], and have meanwhile extended over more than five decades. The calculations\nare based on an expansion of the effect into powers of the parameter Z\u03b1, where Z is the nuclear charge\nand \u03b1 is the fine-structure constant (see e.g. [1, 2, 32, 43]). The expansion is semi-analytic, i.e. it involves\npowers of Z\u03b1 and ln[(Z\u03b1)\u22122 ]. Terms which are of higher than leading order in Z\u03b1 are commonly referred\nto as the binding corrections (see also Ch. 3). A certain nonlogarithmic binding correction, known as the\nA60 -coefficient, has been of particular interest. For relevant formulas and definitions regarding A60 , we\nrefer to Ch. 1, especially to Eqs. (1.1) \u2013 (1.6).\nIn this chapter, we present results of an analytic evaluation of higher-order binding corrections to the\none-loop self energy for excited bound states of hydrogenlike systems. We focus on states with principal\nquantum numbers n = 2 . . . 5 and Dirac angular quantum numbers \u03ba = 1, \u22122, 2, . . . , 4, \u22125. The current\ncalculation represents a continuation of previous investigations on the subject [1, 2].\nThe improved results for A60 coefficients rely essentially on a more compact code for the analytic calculations, written in the computer-algebra package Mathematica [90], which enables the corrections to\nbe evaluated semi-automatically. Intermediate expressions with some 10,000 terms are encountered, and\nthe complexity of the calculations sharply increases with the principal quantum number n, and, as far\nas the complexity of the angular momentum algebra is concerned, with the orbital angular momentum l = |\u03ba + 1/2| \u2212 1/2 of the bound electron. Calculations were performed, in part, on IBM RISC/6000\nworkstations, both at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and at the Laboratoire Kastler\u2013\nBrossel, and profited from the availability of 2 GigaBytes of Random Access Memory.\nOf crucial importance was the development of convergence acceleration methods which were used extensively for the evaluation of remaining one-dimensional integrals which could not be done analytically.\nThese integrals are analogous to expressions encountered in previous work [1, 2]. The numerically evaluated contributions involve slowly convergent hypergeometric series, and \u2013 in more extreme cases \u2013\ninfinite series over partial derivatives of hypergeometric functions, and generalizations of Lerch's \u03a6 transcendent [91, 92]. We have found the Combined Nonlinear\u2013Condensation Transformation [23] to be a\nversatile method for the efficient numerical evaluation of the slowly convergent series encountered in the\nevaluation of the A60 -coefficients.\nResults are given below for the A60 -coefficients with an absolute precision of 10\u22129 . As explained in\ndetail in [1, 2, 32], the calculation of the one-loop self energy falls naturally into a high- and a lowenergy part (FH and FL , respectively). In turn, the low-energy part can be separated naturally into\nthe nonrelativistic dipole and the nonrelativistic quadrupole part, and into relativistic corrections to\nthe current, to the hamiltonian, to the wavefunction, and to the energy of the bound state. For some\nstates, severe numerical cancellations are observed between these (low-energy) contributions to the lowenergy part of the self energy. In the final step of the calculation, we observe additional numerical\n34\n\n\fcancellations between the high- and the low-energy part for the finite contributions to A60 , beyond the\nnecessary cancellation of the divergent contributions which depend on the scale-separation parameter \u01eb;\nthis parameter and the mathematical method which is employed in the expansion of the self energy are\ndescribed and explained in Sec. 2.2. For some of the investigated atomic states, the absolute magnitude\nof the A60 -coefficients is as small as 10\u22123 , although the largest single contribution is always on the order\nof 10\u22122 . This illustrates the cancellations between the finite contributions to A60 .\n\n2.2\n\nThe epsilon-Method\n\nWe discuss here, by way of example, the \u01eb method employed in the analytic calculation of the self energy\nin bound systems. This method is very suitable [1, 2, 32] for the separation of the two different energy\nscales for virtual photons: the nonrelativistic domain, in which the virtual photon assumes values of the\norder of the atomic binding energy, and the relativistic domain, in which the virtual photon assumes\nvalues of the order of the electron rest mass. Different approximation schemes and different asymptotic\nexpansions are adequate for the two different domains. Without these approximations and expansions,\nthe analytic evaluation of either the high- or the low-energy part would not be feasible. Therefore, the\n\u01eb method is also used for the treatment of the highly excited atomic states which are the subject of\n(this part) of the thesis. At the same time, the model example discussed here is meant to illustrate the\nusefulness of the \"\u01eb method\" in a more general context.\nWe will consider here a model problem with one \"virtual photon\". The separation into high-and lowenergy photons necessitates the temporary introduction of a parameter \u01eb; the dependence on \u01eb cancels\nwhen the high- and the low-energy parts are added together. We have,\nnonrelativistic domain \u226a \u01eb \u226a electron rest mass\n(Z\u03b1)2 me\n\n\u226a \u01eb \u226a me ,\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the fine structure constant, and Z is the nuclear charge. The high-energy part is associated\nwith photon energies \u03c9 > \u01eb, and the low-energy part is associated with photon energies \u03c9 < \u01eb.\nIn order to illustrate the procedure, we discuss a simple, one-dimensional example: the evaluation of\nZ 1r 2\n\u03c9 + \u03b22\nd\u03c9 .\n(2.3)\nI(\u03b2) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n0\nwhere the integration variable \u03c9 might be interpreted as the \"energy\" of a \"virtual photon\".

We discuss first the \"high-energy part\" of the calculation. It is given by the expression\nZ 1r 2\n\u03c9 + \u03b22\nd\u03c9 .\n(2.5)\nIH (\u03b2) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n\u01eb\nFor \u03c9 > \u01eb, we may expand\n\np\n\u03b24\n\u03b22\n\u03c92 + \u03b22 = \u03c9 +\n+ O(\u03b2 6 ) ,\n(2.6)\n+\n2 \u03c9 8 \u03c93\nbut this expansion is not applicable in higher orders to the domain 0 < \u03c9 < \u01eb because of the appearance\nof inverse powers of \u03c9 (analogous to an \"infrared divergence\" in QED).\nThe separation parameter \u01eb acts an infrared regulator. After expanding in \u03b2 [see Eq. (2.6)], the resulting\nintegrals in each order of \u03b2 can be evaluated analytically. Subsequently, we expand every term in the\n35\n\n\f\u03b2-expansion in powers of \u01eb up to the order \u01eb0 , i.e. we keep only the divergent and constant terms in \u01eb.\nThe result is\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n2\n2\nIH (\u03b2, \u01eb) = 1 + \u03b2\n+ O(\u01eb)\nln\n2\n\u01eb\n+\u03b2 4\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n1\n2\n1\n+\n\u2212\nln\n+\nO(\u01eb)\n\u2212\n16 \u01eb2 16\n\u01eb\n32\n\n+\u03b2 6\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n1\n3\n+\n+\nln\n64 \u01eb4 64 \u01eb2 128\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u001b\n7\n2\n\u2212\n+ O(\u01eb)\n\u01eb\n512\n\n+O(\u03b2 8 ) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere, the \"O\"-symbol identifies a contribution for which O(x)/x \u2192 const. as x \u2192 0, whereas the \"o\"symbol identifies the weaker requirement o(x) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0; this is consistent with the standard notation\n(see e.g. [53]).\nThe contribution IH (\u03b2) corresponds to the \"high-energy part\" in an analytic calculation of the self energy,\nwhere the propagator of the bound electron is explicitly expanded in powers of the fine structure constant\n\u03b1. Now we turn to the \"low-energy part\". The expression for the low-energy part (0 < \u03c9 < \u01eb) reads\nZ \u01ebr 2\n\u03c9 + \u03b22\nd\u03c9 .\n(2.8)\nIL (\u03b2) =\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n0\nThe expansionp\n(2.6) is not applicable in this energy domain; we therefore have to keep the\n\u221a numerator of\nthe integrand \u03c9 2 + \u03b2 2 in unexpanded form. However, we can expand the denominator 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 of the\nintegrand in powers of \u03c9; because 0 < \u03c9 < \u01eb (with \u01eb small), this expansion in \u03c9 is in fact an expansion\nin \u03b2 \u2013 although the situation is somewhat problematic in the sense that every term in the \u03c9-expansion\ngives rise to terms of arbitrarily high order in the \u03b2-expansion [see also Eq. (2.10) below].\np\nThe term \u03c9 2 + \u03b2 2 is analogous to the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Coulomb propagator in the evaluation of the self\nenergy \u2013 it has to be kept in an unexpanded form \u2013, whereas the expansion\n\u221a\n\n1\n\u03c92\n3\n=1+\n+ \u03c9 4 + O(\u03c9 6 )\n2\n8\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n\n(2.9)\n\ncorresponds to the expansion into the (Z\u03b1)-expansion in the low-energy part.\nEvery term in the expansion (2.9) gives rise to arbitrarily high-order corrections in \u03b2, but it starts with\nthe power \u03c9 n \u2192 \u03b2 n+2 .

Work\nperformed recently on relevant angular functions [93] is expected to become useful in that context. In\norder to facilitate the comparisons and consistency checks which will be of relevance for the numerical\ncalculations, we report here on a number of observations which should facilitate the comparison of numerical and analytic approaches to the self energy problem.

This is the case for Bethe logarithms, for A61 coefficients and also for\nA60 coefficients. This behavior is consistent with the phenomenon that relativistic corrections to the self\nenergy become more important as n increases.\n(iii) For a given principal quantum number n, the coefficients decrease in absolute magnitude with increasing \u03ba. As a function of the nuclear charge number Z, the plots of F (Z\u03b1) against Z should become\n\"more flat\" as \u03ba increases for a given n [94].\n(iv) The A61 coefficients, which represent the dominant relativistic correction to F (Z\u03b1), all have the\nsame (positive) sign for states with \u03ba quantum numbers \u03ba = 2, \u22123, 3, \u22124, 4, \u22125. This \"same-sign\" pattern\nis also true of the A60 coefficients. Because A61 is the dominant correction in the order (Z\u03b1)6 due to the\nenhancement by the large logarithm, this observation explains why, in general, the qualitative dependence\n(on the nuclear charge number Z) of the self energy correction for the highly excited states is the same\nfor the states with \u03ba = 2, \u22123, 3, \u22124, 4, \u22125 (see [94]).\n(v) A61 -coefficients are different for P1/2 and P3/2 states, but the spin dependence vanishes for higher\n\nG7/2 state (\u03ba = 4)\nn\n5\n\nA40\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212 72\n\n4\n3\n\nln k0 (5G)\n\nA40 (num)\n\nA61\n\nA61 (num)\n\nA60 (num)\n\n-0.012 860\n\n2\n4725\n\n0.000 423\n\n0.000 814 414(1)\n\nG9/2 state (\u03ba = \u22125)\nn\n5\n\n1\n90\n\n\u2212\n\n4\n3\n\nA40\n\nA40 (num)\n\nA61\n\nA61 (num)\n\nA60 (num)\n\nln k0 (5G)\n\n0.012 141\n\n2\n4725\n\n0.000 423\n\n0.002 412 929(1)\n\nTable 2.7: Analytic results for G7/2 and G9/2 states.\n\n43\n\n\fContributions to the Low-Energy Part (5G7/2 )\nA60 -contribution due to Fnq\n\n0.002 875 830 9(5).\n\nA60 -contribution due to F\u03b4y\n\n-0.001 083 109 4(5).\n\nA60 -contribution due to F\u03b4H\n\n-0.008 917 782 1(5).\n\nA60 -contribution due to F\u03b4E\n\n0.004 920 556 0(5).\n\nA60 -contribution due to F\u03b4\u03c6\n\n0.004 039 332 1(5).\n\nA60 [from low-energy, cf.

[1, 2], the low-energy part of the self energy can be separated\nnaturally into the nonrelativistic dipole term (which does not contribute to A60 ), and into the\nfollowing contributions: the nonrelativistic quadrupole part Fnq , the relativistic corrections\nto the current F\u03b4y , and relativistic corrections to the hamiltonian F\u03b4H , to the bound-state\nenergy F\u03b4E and to the wavefunction F\u03b4\u03c6 . Observe that the total contribution to A60 to the\nlow-energy part which read 0.001 834 827(1) is almost an order-of-magnitude smaller than\nthe biggest individual contribution (from F\u03b4H ), due to mutual cancellations.\n\nA60 (FH )\nA60 (FL )\nA60\n\n\u22120.001 020 413\n\n0.001 834 827(1)\n\n0.000 814 415(1)\n\nTable 2.9: An additional numerical cancellation occurs when the finite contributions to\nA60 originating from the low-energy part [A60 (FL ), see Eq.

Consequently, A61 -coefficients are the same e.g. for D3/2 and D5/2 states,\nor for F5/2 and F7/2 states etc. This can be easily checked against numerical results.\nPreliminary results indicate satisfactory consistency between the analytic and numerical approaches to\nthe self energy problem for highly excited states [95].\n\n44\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nThe Two\u2013Loop Self\u2013Energy\n3.1\n\nOrientation\n\nIn the current Chapter, we investigate two-loop higher-order binding corrections to the fine structure,\nwhich contribute to the spin-dependent part of the Lamb shift. Our calculation focuses on the so-called\n\"two-loop self energy\" involving two virtual closed photon loops. For bound states, this correction has\nproven to be notoriously difficult to evaluate. The calculation of the binding corrections to the boundstate two-loop self energy is simplified by a separate treatment of hard and soft virtual photons. The two\nphoton-energy scales are matched at the end of the calculation. We present results for the fine-structure\ndifference of the two-loop self energy through the order of \u03b18 .\n\n3.2\n\nIntroduction to the Two\u2013Loop Self\u2013Energy\n\nAs already discussed in Secs. 1.3.1 and 2.1 \u2013 2.3, radiative corrections can be described \u2013 for atomic\nsystems with low nuclear charge number \u2013 by a nonanalytic expansion in powers of the three parameters\n(i) \u03b1 (the fine-structure constant), (ii) the product Z\u03b1 (Z is the nuclear charge number), and (iii) the\nlogarithm ln[(Z\u03b1)\u22122 ]. The expansion in powers of \u03b1, which is the perturbation theory parameter in\nquantum electrodynamics (QED), corresponds to the number of loops in the diagrams. The bound-state\neffects are taken into account by the expansions in the two latter parameters (see also Ch. 2). Higher-order\nterms in the expansions in powers of Z\u03b1 and ln[(Z\u03b1)\u22122 ] are referred to as the \"binding corrections\". One\nof the historically most problematic sets of Feynman diagrams in the treatment of the Lamb shift for\natomic systems has been the radiative correction due to two closed virtual-photon loops shown in Fig. 3.1.\nLet us recall at this point that even the evaluation of higher-order binding corrections to the one-loop\nself energy \u2013 see also Ch. 2 \u2013, which a priori should represent a less involved calculational challenge,\nhas represented a problem for analytic evaluations for over three decades [1, 2, 9, 32, 70, 71, 96]. The\nenergy shifts of the bound states due to the radiative corrections are conveniently expressed by expansion\ncoefficients corresponding to the powers of Z\u03b1 and ln[(Z\u03b1)\u22122 ]; the naming convention is that the power of\nZ\u03b1 and the power of the logarithm are indicated as indices to the analytic coefficients [see also Eq. (3.1)]\nbelow. Because the expansion in both the one-loop and the two-loop case starts with the fourth power of\nZ\u03b1, the non-vanishing coefficients carry indices Akl and Bkl for the one- and two-loop cases, respectively\n(with k \u2265 4 \u2013 see [49, 97] for comprehensive reviews).\n\nLogarithmic corrections with l \u2265 1 can sometimes be inferred separately in a much simplified approach,\ne.g. by considering infrared divergent contributions to electron form factors. By contrast, the higherorder non-logarithmic coefficients represent a considerable calculational challenge. Realistically, i.e. with\nthe help of current computer algebra systems [90], one can hope to evaluate non-logarithmic coefficients\nof sixth order in Z\u03b1. Complete results for the one-loop higher-order correction A60 for S and P states\nhave only been available recently [1, 2, 32]. Calculational difficulties have by now precluded a successful\nevaluation of the corresponding coefficient B60 for the two-loop effect. Ground-work for the evaluation of\nB60 was laid in [98]. Here, we are concerned with the evaluation of the fine-structure differences of the\n\n45\n\n\f\u0001\n\nFigure 3.1: Feynman diagrams representing the two-photon electron self energy. The double line denotes the bound electron propagator. The arrow of time is from left to right.\n\nlogarithmic and non-logarithmic coefficients B6L (where L = 0, 1, 2), i.e. with the nP3/2 \u2013nP1/2 difference\nof these coefficients.\nUsing natural Gaussian units (~ = c = \u01eb0 = 1), as it is customary for the current type of calculation, we\nwrite the two-photon self energy in the Z\u03b1-expansion for P states in terms of B-coefficients as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n2\n\u22122\n\u22122\n4 m\n(3.1)\n(Z\u03b1) 3 B40 + (Z\u03b1) B62 ln (Z\u03b1) + B61 ln(Z\u03b1) + B60 + R ,\n\u2206ESE =\n\u03c0\nn\nwhere the remainder R is of order O(Z\u03b1)3 . Relevant Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 3.1.\n\nHere, m denotes the electron mass (we write Eq. (3.1) in the non-recoil limit, i.e. for an infinite nuclear\nmass). The double logarithmic B62 -coefficient is spin-independent, so that we have \u2206fs B62 = 0. Here, we\nevaluate the fine-structure differences\n\u2206fs B61\n\n= B61 (nP3/2 ) \u2212 B61 (nP1/2 ) ,\n\n\u2206fs B60\n\n= B60 (nP3/2 ) \u2212 B60 (nP1/2 ) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe follow the convention that \u2206fs X \u2261 X(nP3/2 ) \u2212 X(nP1/2 ) denotes the \"fine-structure part\" of a\ngiven quantity X. For \u2206fs B61 and \u2206fs B60 , we provide complete results. It is perhaps worth noting\nthat the two-loop self energy for bound states has represented a considerable challenge for theoretical\nevaluations. Our investigation represents a continuation of previous work on the two-loop problem (see\ne.g. [98, 99, 100, 101]). It is probably a triviality to express that technical difficulties in the calculation\nand its description in the following Sections cannot be avoided.\nFor the description of the self energy radiative effects \u2013 mediated by hard virtual photons \u2013, we use the\nmodified Dirac hamiltonian\ne\n(m)\nHD = \u03b1 * [p \u2212 e F1 (\u2206) A] + \u03b2 m + e F1 (\u2206) \u03c6 + F2 (\u2206)\n(i \u03b3 * E \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c3 * B) ,\n(3.3)\n2m\nwhich approximately describes an electron subject to an external scalar potential \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(r) and an\nexternal vector potential A \u2261 A(r). This modified hamiltonian is still local in coordinate space. The\nDirac matrices in (3.3) are to be understood in the standard (Dirac) representation [34] (in the sequel,\nwe will also use the non-covariant notation \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b3 0 and \u03b1i \u2261 \u03b3 0 \u03b3 i ).\n46\n\n\fThe argument \u2206 of the electron form factors F1 and F2 in Eq. (3.3) is to be interpreted as a Laplacian\noperator acting on all quantities to the right (but not on the wave function of the bound electron in\n(m)\n(m)\nevaluating\nh HD i |\u03c8i). InR momentum space, the action of the hamiltonian HD is described by the convo(m)\n(m)\nlution HD \u03c8 (p\u2032 ) = d3 p/(2\u03c0)3 HD (p\u2032 \u2212 p) \u03c8(p). The form factors \u2013 in momentum space \u2013 assume\n\narguments according to the replacement \u2206 \u2192 \u2212q2 \u2261 \u2212(p\u2032 \u2212 p)2 . In Eq. (3.3), radiative corrections are\ntaken into account in the sense of an effective theory via the inclusion of the on-shell form factors F1\nand F2 . Although the bound electron is not an on-shell particle, the modified hamiltonian (3.3) can still\napproximately account for significant radiative systems with low nuclear charge number Z. Of course,\nthe hamiltonian (3.3) cannot offer a complete description of the bound electron. Recoil effects cannot be\ndescribed by a one-particle equation in principle, and vacuum-polarization effects are not contained in\nEq. (3.3). However, the effective description of self energy radiative corrections mediated by hard virtual\nphotons given by Eq. (3.3) will turn out to be useful in the context of the current investigation of the\ntwo-loop self energy.\n\nBoth of the form factors F1 and F2 entering in Eq. (3.3) are infrared divergent, but this divergence is\ncut off in a natural way at the atomic binding energy scale (Z\u03b1)2 m. The fact that on-shell form factors\ncan describe radiative corrections to the fine structure \u2013 mediated by high-energy virtual photons \u2013 has\nbeen demonstrated explicitly in [89]. The modified Dirac hamiltonian (3.3) and the associated modified\nDirac equation have been introduced \u2013 in the one-loop approximation \u2013 in Ch. 7 of [34] [see for example\nEqs. (7-77) and (7-103) ibid.]. The low-energy part of the calculation is carried out using nonrelativistic\napproximations in the spirit of the simplified treatment introduced in the previous one- and two-loop\ncalculations [1, 2, 32, 98, 102]. This approach was inspired, in part, by various attempts to formulate\nsimplified low-energy (\"nonrelativistic\") approximations to quantum electrodynamics (\"NRQED\"), see\ne.g. [103, 104]. Both the high-energy and the low-energy contributions are matched at the separation scale\n\u01eb whose r\u00f4le in the calculation is illustrated by the mathematical model example discussed in Sec. 2.2.\nIn a two-loop calculation, either of the two virtual photons may have a high or low energy as compared to\nthe separation scale \u01eb. A priori, this necessitates [98] a separation of the calculation into three different\ncontributions: (i) both photon energies large, (ii) one photon with a large and one with a small energy, and\n(iii) both photons with small energies. For the particular problem at hand (the fine-structure differences\nof B61 and B60 ), we are in the fortunate position that effects caused by hard virtual photons (i) are\ndescribed by the modified Dirac hamiltonian (3.3), whereas the low-energy part discussed in Sec. 3.5\nbelow comprises both remaining contributions (ii) and (iii).\nWe will continue by analyzing the two-loop form factors which enter into Eq. (3.3); these will be treated\nin Sec. 3.3. The calculation will be split into two parts: the high-energy part discussed in Sec. 3.4 and\nthe low-energy part, which is treated along ideas introduced in [104] in Sec. 3.5.\n\n3.3\n\nTwo-loop Form Factors\n\nIn order to analyze the modified Dirac hamiltonian (3.3) through two-loop order, we first have to investigate certain expansion coefficients of the electronic F1 and F2 form factors which are thoroughly\ndiscussed in the seminal papers [105, 106]. For the momentum transfer q 2 which is the argument of the\ntwo functions F1 \u2261 F1 (q 2 ) and F2 \u2261 F2 (q 2 ), we use the convention q 2 = q\u03bc q \u03bc = (q 0 )2 \u2212 q 2 . The variable t\nin [105, 106] is given as t = q 2 . When we evaluate radiative corrections to the binding Coulomb field which\nis mediated by space-like virtual photons, we have q 2 = \u2212q2 because for q 0 = 0. We use the conventions\n(see Eq. (1.2) in [105]):\nF1 (t) = 1 +\n\n\u221e \u0010 \u0011n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nn=1\n\n\u03c0\n\n(2n)\n\nF1\n\n(t) ,\n\nF2 (t) =\n\n\u221e \u0010 \u0011n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nn=1\n\n\u03c0\n\n(2n)\n\nF2\n\n(t) .\n\n(3.4)\n\nOne and two-loop effects are denoted by upper indices 2 and 4, respectively. This notation is motivated\nby the observation that two-loop effects are of forth order in the quantum electrodynamic interaction\nLagrangian \u2212e \u03c8\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc A\u03bc \u03c8 (in the Furry picture, which is used for the description of bound states, the\nCoulomb interaction is taken out of the interaction Lagrangian).\nThere are two different points of view regarding the choice of diagrams to be included in the two-loop\nform factors, depending on whether the self energy vacuum polarization diagram Fig. 3.2 is included in\n47\n\n\f\u0001\n\nthe calculation or not. We will discuss both cases and give results with and without the diagram shown\nin Fig. 3.2 taken into account.\n\n(\n\nV)\n\nFigure 3.2: Combined self energy vacuum-polarization diagram (denoted \"V \"\nin the text).\n\nFirst, we discuss results obtained for F1 including the combined self energy vacuum polarization diagram.\nIn this case, the known results for the slope F1\u2032 (0) and for F2 (0), through two-loop order, read as follows.\nFrom Eq.

In view of Eq.

We will refer to the energy corrections attributable to the F1 and F2 form factors as E1 and\nE2 , respectively. For E1 , we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(3.20)\nE1 = F1 (\u2212q 2 ) \u2212 1 e \u03c6 fs ,\n\nwhere the index fs refers to the fine-structure terms, i.e. to the result obtained by subtracting the value\nof the matrix element for a nP3/2 state from the value of the same matrix element evaluated on a nP1/2\nstate. A matrix element hAifs of a given operator A is evaluated as\n\u001d\n\u001d \u001c\n\u001c\nhAifs \u2261 \u03c8nP3/2 A \u03c8nP3/2 \u2212 \u03c8nP1/2 A \u03c8nP1/2 .\n\nNote that in evaluating these matrix elements, \u03c8 + (the hermitian conjugate of the Dirac wave function\n\u03c8) should be used (not the Dirac adjoint \u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8 + \u03b3 0 ). The Dirac wave functions \u03c8 are expanded in powers\nof (Z\u03b1) up to the order relevant for the current investigation of two-loop effects. This expansion avoids\npotential problems associated with the logarithmic divergence of the Dirac wave function at the origin.\nFor E1 , up to the order of (Z\u03b1)6 , we have\n\u2032(4)\n\nE1 = 4\u03c0Z\u03b1 F1\n\nD\nE\n(0) \u03b4 (3) (r)\n.\nfs\n\n(3.21)\n\nFor P states, the nonrelativistic (Schr\u00f6dinger) wave function \u2013 the leading term in the Z\u03b1-expansion of\nthe Dirac wave function \u2013 vanishes at r = 0, but the first relativistic correction gives a finite contribution,\nresulting in\nn2 \u2212 1\n(Z\u03b1)5 m3 .\n(3.22)\nh\u03b4 (3) (r)ifs = \u2212\n4 n5\nThis leads \u2013 again up to the order of (Z\u03b1)6 \u2013 to the following result for E1 ,\n\u0015\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 (Z\u03b1)6 \u0014\nn2 \u2212 1\n\u2032(4)\nE1 =\n\u2212F1 (0)\nm3 .\n\u03c0\nn3\nn2\n\n(3.23)\n\nObserve that the derivative of the F1 form factor has a physical dimension of 1/m2 in natural units,\ngiving the correct physical dimension for E1 .

Vacuum polarization corrections to E = \u2212(Ze) r/(4\u03c0r3 )\nlead to higher-order effects. The correction E2 splits up in a natural way into two contributions E2a and\nE2b which are associated with F2 (0) and the slope F2\u2032 (0), respectively.

(3.11) and (3.19)]. We\nare thus faced with the problem of matching the infrared divergence of the slope of the F2 form factor,\nexpressed in terms of the fictitious photon mass \u03bb, with the usual (energy matching parameter) \u01eb introduced originally in [32]. This can be done in two ways: (i) by matching the infrared divergence of the rate\nof soft bremsstrahlung, calculated with a fictitious photon mass \u03bb, to a result of the same calculation,\ncarried out with an explicit infrared cut-off \u01eb for the photon energy. This way of calculation is described\non pp. 361\u2013362 of [34]. It leads to the result\nln\n\n5\n\u03bb\n=\u2212 .\n2\u01eb\n6\n\n(3.31)\n\nThe matching procedure (ii) consists in a comparison of the result of the application of the formalism\nconsidered above, and its application to the high-energy part of the ground state Lamb shift, which is in\nleading order given by the infrared divergence of the F1 form factor, and the result obtained by direct\ncalculation of this high-energy part in a non-covariant formalism with an explicit energy cut-off \u01eb, as it\nhas been carried out in [32]. This second matching procedure leads to the following result \u2013 in agreement\nwith (3.31) \u2013,\nm 3\nm 11\nln\n\u2212 = ln\n+\n.\n(3.32)\n\u03bb\n8\n2\u01eb 24\nSo, we are led to the replacement\n\u03bb\nm 5\n\u2212 ln\n\u2192 ln\n+\n(3.33)\nm\n2\u01eb 6\nA comparison with the results in Eqs.

Because\nwe are only interested in the fine structure, we isolate the terms which are proportional to the spin-orbit\ncoupling, and we obtain\n+\n*\n\u0013\u2032\n\u0012\n1\n,\n(3.37)\n[2F2 (0)] Hfs\nE3 = [2F2 (0)] Hfs\nE\u2212H\nfs\n\nwhere\n\nZ\u03b1\n\u03c3 * L,\n(3.38)\n4m2 r3\nand 1/(E \u2212 H)\u2032 is the nonrelativistic, spin-independent reduced Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Coulomb Green function [114, 115]. The only spin-dependence in (3.37) occurs in the coupling \u03c3 * L, and it can be taken\ninto account by an overall factor,\n(3.39)\n(\u03c3 * L)2 fs = \u22123 .\nHfs =\n\nWe are therefore led to consider the \"spin-independent version\" of the matrix element which occurs in\nEq.

(3.39). The index \"nP\" in Eq. (3.40)\nmeans that the matrix element is evaluated with the nonrelativistic, spin-independent (Schr\u00f6dinger)\nwave function. Alternatively, on may evaluate with either the nP1/2 or the nP3/2 Dirac wave function\nand expand up to the leading order in (Z\u03b1).\nThe evaluation of (3.40) can proceed e.g. by solving the differential equation which defines the correction\nto the wave function induced by Hfs , and subsequent direct evaluation of the resulting standard integrals\nusing computer algebra [90]. The final result for E3 reads,\n\u0015\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 (Z\u03b1)6 \u0014 227\n1\n3\nm.\n(3.41)\n+\n\u2212\nE3 =\n\u03c0\nn3\n2880 32n 80n2\nThis concludes the discussion of the high-energy part. The final result for the high-energy part is\nEH = E1 + E2a + E2b + E3 ,\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere E1 , E2a , E2b , E3 are given in Eqs. (3.23), (3.27), (3.36), (3.41), respectively.\n\n3.5\n\nLow\u2013Energy Part\n\nThe low-energy part consists essentially of two contributions. Both effects, denoted here E4 and E5 , can\nbe obtained by a suitable variation of the low-energy part of the one-loop self energy, by considering the\nspin-dependent effects introduced by a further one-loop electron anomalous magnetic moment interaction.\nThe first of the two terms, E4 , is caused by spin-dependent higher-order effects in the one-loop self energy,\nwhich receive additional corrections due to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The second\nterm, E5 , is due to an anomalous magnetic moment correction to the electron transition current, which\n\n52\n\n\fcan also be seen as a correction to the radiation field of the electron due to its anomalous magnetic\nmoment.\nThe leading-order low-energy part (see [32]) reads\n\u001d\n\u001c\nZ \u01eb\n2\u03b1\n1\np \u03c6 .\nEL = \u2212\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c6 p\n3\u03c0m 0\nH \u2212 (E \u2212 \u03c9)\n\n(3.43)\n\nIn order to isolate the fine-structure effects, we should now consider corrections to the wave function, to\nthe current, to the hamiltonian and to the energy of the bound state due to the spin-dependent relativistic\n(spin-orbit) hamiltonian\n\u03b1(Z\u03b1) \u2212i \u03b3 * r\ne\n.\n(3.44)\ni\u03b3 * E =\nH = F2 (0)\n2m\n4\u03c0m\nr3\nThe above hamiltonian H is the last term in the modified Dirac hamiltonian [right-hand side of Eq. (3.3)],\napproximated for a particle bound in a Coulomb field with the F2 form factor evaluated at zero momentum. The electric field E in (3.44) corresponds to the binding Coulomb interaction. The hamiltonian\n(3.44) describes the modification of the spin-orbit interaction due to the anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe electron.\nThe nonrelativistic limit of H is the spin-orbit coupling Hfs given in Eq. (3.38), multiplied by a factor\n(2)\n2F2 (0) = \u03b1/\u03c0 (the additional factor 2 finds an explanation in [116]). The resulting hamiltonian\nHeff =\n\n\u03b1 Z\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c3*L\nHfs =\n\u03c0\n\u03c0 4m2 r3\n\n(3.45)\n\ntakes into account magnetic vertex corrections in the framework of an effective theory. Denoting the\nvariation of the expression (3.43) mediated by Heff with the symbol \u03b4eff \u2013 in the spirit of the notation\nintroduced in [98] \u2013, we obtain the contribution\n\u001a\n\u001d\u001b\n\u001c\nZ \u01eb\n2\u03b1\n1\np \u03c6\n.\n(3.46)\nE4a = \u03b4eff \u2212\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c6 p\n3\u03c0m 0\nH \u2212 (E \u2212 \u03c9)\nFollowing the notation introduced in [1, 2], the contribution E4a is the sum of the fine-structure effects\ncreated by the wave-function-correction F\u03b4\u03c6 , the first relativistic correction to the energy F\u03b4E , and the\ncorrection due to the relativistic hamiltonian F\u03b4H , each multiplied by a factor \u03b1/\u03c0. The final result for\nE4 is\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\nm\n(Z\u03b1)4 3 (\u2206fs F\u03b4\u03c6 + \u2206fs F\u03b4E + \u2206fs F\u03b4H ) .\n(3.47)\nE4a =\n\u03c0\nn\nThere is a further correction to the nonrelativistic effective coupling to the radiation field due to the\n\"anomalous spin-orbit hamiltonian\" (3.44). The correction, in the nonrelativistic limit, can be derived by\nconsidering a Foldy\u2013Wouthuysen transformation which by definition diagonalizes the hamiltonian (3.44)\nin spinor space and also leads to corrections to the current according to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2H\n.\n(3.48)\n\u03b1i \u2192 U \u03b1i U \u22121 , U = exp \u2212i\n2m\nHere, \u03b2 and \u03b1i are standard Dirac matrices [34], i is a spatial index, and H is given in (3.44). The\ncalculation is carried out along ideas introduced in [1] and leads to the result\n\u03b4j 4b =\n\n\u03b1 Z\u03b1\n\u03c3 \u00d7r,\n\u03c0 2mr3\n\n(3.49)\n\nas a relativistic correction to the electron current which is simply \u03b1i in the relativistic formalism and\npi /m in the leading nonrelativistic approximation. Again, following the notation introduced in [1, 2], the\nresulting additional contribution is\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\nm\nE4b =\n(Z\u03b1)4 3 \u2206fs F\u03b4y .\n(3.50)\n\u03c0\nn\n\nThe sum of (3.47) and (3.50) is just the (Z\u03b1)6 \u2013component of the fine-structure difference of the one-loop\nself energy from [1, 2], multiplied by an additional factor \u03b1/\u03c0. It can also be written as\n\u0015\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 (Z\u03b1)6 m \u0014 n2 \u2212 1\n2\u01eb\nn2 \u2212 1\n\u2212\nln\n\u2206fs l4 (n) ,\n(3.51)\n+\nE4 = E4a + E4b =\n\u03c0\nn3\n3n2\n(Z\u03b1)2 m\nn2\n53\n\n\fwhere \u2206fs l4 (n) could be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of a Bethe logarithm, which is ndependent. However, a significant numerical fraction of the n-dependence can be eliminated if the factor\n(n2 \u22121)/n2 is taken out of the final result. The evaluation of \u2206fs l4 (n) has recently been performed in [117]\nwith improved numerical methods (see e.g. [23]), and the following results have been obtained:\n\u2206fs l4 (2) =\n\n0.512 559 768(1) ,\n\n\u2206fs l4 (3) =\n\n0.511 978 815(1) ,\n\n\u2206fs l4 (4) =\n\n0.516 095 539(1) ,\n\n\u2206fs l4 (5) =\n\n0.519 976 941(1) ,\n\n(3.52)\n\nwhere the uncertainty is due to numerical integration.\nThere is, as stated above, a further correction due to the explicit modification of the transition current\ndue to the anomalous magnetic moment; it can be obtained through the replacement\n\u03b1i \u2192 \u03b1i + F2 (0)\n\ni \u03b2 \u03c3 i\u03bd\nq\u03bd\n2m\n\n(3.53)\n\nand must be considered in addition to the correction (3.48). A careful consideration of the nonrelativistic\nlimit of this correction to the current, including retardation effects, leads to the result\n\u03b4j 5 =\n\n\u03b1 Z\u03b1\n\u03c3\u00d7r.\n2\u03c0 2mr3\n\n(3.54)\n\nConsequently, we find that the correction is effectively F2 (0) times the retardation corrections to the\ntransition current F\u03b4y found in [1, 2].

(3.51) and (3.56), respectively.\nWe can now understand why it was possible to join the two contributions with \"mixed\" and \"low-andlow\" energy virtual photons (ii) and (iii), which were discussed in Sec. 3.2, into a joint \"low-energy part\".\nThe reason is simple: The effective hamiltonian (3.45) has no infrared divergence, because it involves the\nlow-energy limit of the magnetic form factor F2 , which is infrared safe in one-loop order according to\nEq. (3.9). Because the main contribution to the quantity F2 (0) is caused by hard virtual photons, it is\nalso justified to say that the contribution of \"low-and-low\" energy virtual photons vanishes at the order\nof interest for the current calculation (fine-structure difference). In higher-loop order, the further infrared\ndivergence acquired by F2 would lead to an infrared divergence in the effective hamiltonian constructed in\nanalogy with Eq. (3.45); this infrared divergence would have to be attributed to a \"mixed\" contribution.\n54\n\n\f3.6\n\nResults for the Two\u2013Loop Corrections\n\nWe have obtained analytic results for higher-order correction to the two-loop self energy of P states in\nhydrogen-like systems. In our calculation, we have analyzed the electron form factors through two-loop\norder in Sec. 3.3, and we have split the calculation into a high-energy part with two hard virtual photons\ndiscussed in Sec. 3.4, and a low-energy part with at least one soft virtual photon analyzed in Sec. 3.5.\nThe final result for the contribution to the fine-structure energy difference is obtained by adding the\nhigh-energy contributions E1 \u2013 E3 given in Eqs. (3.23), (3.27), (3.36), (3.41), and the low-energy effects\nE4 and E5 from Eqs. (3.51) and (3.56). The dependence on \u01eb cancels out in the final result which is the\nsum of the high-energy part EH given in Eq. (3.42) and the low-energy part EL defined in Eq. (3.58). This\nis also evident when considering explicitly the Eqs. (3.36) and (3.51).

(3.6), (3.8) and (3.11) instead of the pure self energy results given in\nEqs. (3.17), (3.18) and (3.19) have to be used in evaluating (3.60). When including the combined self\nenergy vacuum-polarization diagram from Fig. 3.2, there is no further low-energy contribution, so that\nthe alternative set of numerical values for the form factors from Eqs. (3.6), (3.8) and (3.11) fully takes\ninto account the additional effect of the diagram in Fig. 3.1 on the fine-structure in the order of \u03b12 (Z\u03b1)6 .\n\n55\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nSpinless Particles in Bound\u2013State\nQuantum Electrodynamics\n4.1\n\nOrientation\n\nWe describe in this Chapter a simplified derivation of the relativistic corrections of order \u03b14 for a bound\nsystem consisting of two spinless particles. We devote special attention to pionium, the bound system of\ntwo oppositely charged pions. The leading quantum electrodynamic (QED) correction to the energy levels\nis of the order of \u03b13 and due to electronic vacuum polarization. We analyze further corrections due to the\nself energy of the pions, and due to recoil effects, and we give a complete result for the scalar-QED leading\nlogarithmic corrections which are due to virtual loops involving only the scalar constituent particles (the\npions); these corrections are of order \u03b15 ln \u03b1 for S states.\n\n4.2\n\nIntroduction to Spinless QED and Pionium\n\nExotic bound systems like pionium [118, 119] (the bound system of two oppositely charged pions) offer\ninteresting possibilities for studies of fundamental properties of quantum mechanical bound states: the\ninterplay between strong-interaction corrections and quantum electrodynamic corrections is of prime\ninterest, and the small length scales characteristic of the heavy particles make it possible to explore effects\nof the virtual excitations of the quantum fields in previously unexplored kinematical regimes [3, 4, 6].\nWe do not wish to hide the fact that any potential high-precision experiments in this area are faced with\nvarious experimental difficulties. Our calculations address QED corrections to the spectrum of bound\nsystems whose constituent particles are spinless; relativistic corrections to the decay lifetime of pionium\nhave recently been discussed in [120] in the context of the DIRAC experiment at CERN.\nHere, we report on results regarding the spectrum of a bound system consisting of two spinless particles.\nWe apply the simplified calculational scheme employed in [40] for the relativistic and recoil corrections to\na bound system of two \"non-Dirac\" particles to the case of two interacting spinless particles (see Sec. 4.3).\nWe then recall known results on leading-order vacuum polarization corrections in Sec. 4.4 and clarify the\nrelative order-of-magnitude of the one- and two-loop electronic vacuum polarization, the relativistic and\nrecoil corrections and the self energies in pionium (also in Sec. 4.4). We then provide an estimate for the\nself energy in Sec. 4.5, and we analyze the leading recoil correction of order \u03b15 (the Salpeter correction)\nwhich leads us to complete results for the scalar-QED logarithmic corrections of order \u03b15 ln \u03b1.\n\n4.3\n\nBreit hamiltonian for Spinless Particles\n\nWe start from the Lagrangian for a charged spinless field coupled to the electromagnetic field [see equations (6-50) \u2013 (6-51b) of [34]],\nL(x) = [(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc ) \u03c6\u2217 (x)] (\u2202 \u03bc + ieA\u03bc ) \u03c6(x) \u2212 m2 \u03c6\u2217 (x) \u03c6(x) \u2212\n56\n\n1\nF\u03bc\u03bd (x) F \u03bc\u03bd (x) ,\n4\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fwhere the field strength tensor F\u03bc\u03bd reads F\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd (x) \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc (x). We use natural Gaussian units\nwith ~ = c = \u01eb0 = 1. The transition current for a free spinless particle (A\u03bc = 0) can be inferred from\n(4.1); it reads in momentum space\nj \u03bc (p\u2032 , p) = \u03c6\u2217 (p\u2032 ) (p\u2032\u03bc + p\u03bc ) \u03c6(p) .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThis current now has to be expressed in terms of nonrelativistic wave functions. Specifically, the j 0 component has to reproduce the normalization of the nonrelativistic (Schr\u00f6dinger) wave function. By\ncontrast, according to Eq. (4.2) the zero-component of the current reads 2m \u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 in the nonrelativistic\nlimit p\u20320 \u2192 m , p0 \u2192 m. The nonrelativistic wave functions are normalized according to\nZ\nd3 x \u03c6\u2217S (x)\u03c6S (x) = 1 .\n(4.3)\nIt is therefore evident that we cannot simply associate the relativistic wave function \u03c6 with \u03c6S ; rather,\nwe should define according to Eqs. (13) \u2013 (14) of [40]\n\u03c6(p) =\n\n\u03c6S (p0 , p)\np\n,\n2p0\n\n(4.4)\n\np\nwhere p0 = p2 + m2 \u2248 m is the energy of the free nonrelativistic particle (in deriving low-energy\neffective interactions, one always expands about free-particle amplitudes; all interactions are treated as\nperturbations; note the analogy to nonrelativistic QED \u2013 NRQED \u2013 for spinor particles [104]). The\nKlein\u2013Gordon current, in the presence of external fields, reads in contrast to (4.2)\nj \u03bc (p\u2032 , p) = \u03c6\u2217 (p\u2032 ) (p\u2032\u03bc + p\u03bc \u2212 2 eA\u03bc ) \u03c6(p) .\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe zero-component of this current can be interpreted as a charge density, which is not necessarily\npositive definite. Questions related to the normalization of the Klein\u2013Gordon wave functions in this case\nare discussed in detail in [121, 122, 123, 124].\nIn terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function, the current is given as\nj 0 (p\u2032 , p)\n\n= \u03c6\u2217S (p\u2032 ) \u03c6S (p) ,\n\nj i (p\u2032 , p)\n\n= \u03c6\u2217S (p\u2032 )\n\npi + p\u2032i\n\u03c6S (p) ,\n2m\n\n(4.6)\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle. The atomic momenta pi and p\u2032i in Eq. (4.7) are of order Z\u03b1.\nAs shown below, interactions involving the spatial components j i of the transition current give rise to\nrelativistic contributions of order (Z\u03b1)4 to the spectrum. This is exactly the order of magnitude that\nis the subject of the current investigation. Therefore, although Eq. (4.7) is only valid up to corrections\nof relative order (Z\u03b1)2 , these can be neglected because the further corrections contribute to the energy\nlevels at the order of (Z\u03b1)6 . Specifically, we can expect corrections proportional to (pi p2 ) to the current\nj i when a systematic expansion of the nonrelativistic current is performed; these terms are analogous to\nthose obtained for relativistic corrections to the current of spinor particles which can be obtained via a\nFoldy\u2013Wouthuysen transformation [1, 125].\nIn the following, the index S on the wave function will be dropped, and the nonrelativistic amplitudes\ndescribing the two interacting particles (with electric charges e1 and e2 ) will be denoted as \u03c61 and \u03c62 ,\nrespectively. Following [40], the Breit hamiltonian U (p1 , p2 , q) in momentum space is related to the\ninvariant scattering amplitude M and to the photon propagator D\u03bc\u03bd (q) in the following way [see also\nequation (83,8) in [126]]:\nM\n\n=\n\ne1 e2 j1\u03bc (p\u20321 , p1 ) D\u03bc\u03bd (q) j2\u03bd (p\u20322 , p2 )\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03c6\u22171 (p\u20321 ) \u03c6\u22172 (p\u20322 )\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ne1 e2\n+\nU\n(p\n,\np\n,\nq)\n\u03c61 (p1 ) \u03c62 (p2 )\n1\n2\nq2\n57\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fwhere q = p\u20322 \u2212 p2 = \u2212(p1 \u2212 p\u20321 ).

Denoting with p\u0302 = \u2212i \u2202/\u2202x the\nmomentum operator in the coordinate-space representation, we obtain\nHB (r, p\u0302) = \u2212\n\np\u03024\np\u03024\ne1 e2 p\u03022\ne1 e2 r * (r * p\u0302) p\u0302\n\u2212\n+\n+\n.\n3\n3\n8 m1 8 m2\n8\u03c0r m1 m2\n8\u03c0r3\nm1 m2\n\n(4.14)\n\nIn the order of (Z\u03b1)4 , there is no contribution due to virtual annihilation for spinless particles; corrections\nof this type would enter only for positronium and dimuonium [6] because they are caused by the spindependent part of the transition current [see Eqs. (83,20) and (82,22) of [126]], which is absent for spinless\nparticles. For S states, virtual annihilation is altogether prohibited by angular momentum conservation.\nThe matrix elements of the Breit hamiltonian (4.14) for spinless particles can be evaluated on nonrelativistic bound states via computational techniques outlined in Sec. A3 of Ch. 1 of [116]. For m1 = m2 = m\nand e1 e2 = \u22124\u03c0Z\u03b1, we obtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(Z\u03b1)2 m (Z\u03b1)4 m\n1\n1\n11\nEB = \u2212\n(4.15)\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u03b4l0 \u2212\n4n2\n2 n3\n2l + 1 4\n32 n\n58\n\n\fas the Breit energy for the energy levels of the bound system of two spinless particles, including relativistic\ncorrections of order (Z\u03b1)4 . Here, we keep Z as a parameter which denotes the nuclear charge number in\na bound system. Of course, for two particles each carrying an elementary charge, Z has to be set to unity.\nThe fine-structure constant is denoted by \u03b1. The result (4.15) agrees with previous calculations [40, 127,\n128, 129, 130, 131], notably with Eq. (38) of [129].\nIt is instructive to compare the result (4.15) with the known result for a single-particle system of mass\nm/2 satisfying the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, bound to a nucleus with charge Ze. According to Eq. (2-86)\nof [34], we obtain the \"Klein\u2013Gordon energy\" (KG)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n3\n(Z\u03b1)2 m (Z\u03b1)4 m\n.\n(4.16)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nEKG = \u2212\n4n2\n2 n3\n2l + 1 8 n\nThe two results (4.15) and (4.16) are manifestly different in the order of (Z\u03b1)4 .\nFrom (4.14) we conclude that the zitterbewegung term is absent for spinless particles. However, this\nstatement is in need of further explanation because a considerable variety of physical interpretations\nexists in the literature with regard to the zitterbewegung term. We briefly expand: The Dirac \u03b1-matrices\nfulfill \u03b1 = i[HD , x] (HD is the Dirac hamiltonian) as the relativistic generalization of the velocity operator.\nBy contrast, in the nonrelativistic formalism, we have the analogous relation p/m = i[HS , x] where HS is\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger hamiltonian. Since the \u03b1\u2013matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11, the magnitude of the velocity\nof the electron \u2013 at face value \u2013 is equal to the velocity of light at any given instant. On p. 106 of [132],\nit is argued that \"the explanation for this fact is that the electron carries out a fast irregular motion\n(\"zitterbewegung\") \u2013 which is responsible for the spin \u2013 whereas the mean velocity is given by the\nmomentum p/m\". Note that the introduction of the Dirac matrix formalism is necessitated by the need\nto describe the internal degrees of freedom of the particle \u2013 the spin. On p. 71 of [34], it is shown that the\nzitterbewegung term can be traced back to the positional fluctuations h\u03b4r 2 i \u223c 1/m2 of the electron, and a\nconnection is drawn to the Darwin term which results naturally in the context of the Foldy\u2013Wouthuysen\ntransformed Dirac hamiltonian. On pp. 117\u2013118 of [133] and p. 62 of [34], it is argued that the momentum\np of a Dirac wave packet can be associated in a natural way with the group velocity, but that in addition to\nthe group velocity term, there exist highly oscillatory terms which represent the zitterbewegung. Similarly,\non pp. 139\u2013140 of [133], it is shown that the zitterbewegung term can also be interpreted as arising from\nthe interaction of the atomic electron with virtual electron-positron pairs created in the Coulomb field of\nthe nucleus. This virtual electron-positron pair-creation is subject to the uncertainty principle and can\noccur only for time intervals of the order of \u2206t \u223c ~/(2mc2 ) (where we temporarily restore the factor ~).\nAt the time the original atomic electron fills up the vacated negative-energy state (the bound-electron\nwave-function has negative-energy components), the escalated electron (which forms part of the virtual\npair) is at most a distance c\u2206t \u223c 1/m away from the original electron. This distance is precisely of the\norder of magnitude of the fluctuations of the electron coordinate and consistent with the discussion on\np. 71 of [34]. All these interpretations elucidate different aspects of the same problem.\nIn the context of the Breit hamiltonian, we would like to adhere to the definition that the zitterbewegung\nterm is the term of order (Z\u03b1)4 in the Breit hamiltonian generated by a contribution which is manifestly\nproportional of \u03b4(r) in coordinate space (or a constant in momentum space). Such a term is absent in\nthe result (4.14). For spin-1/2 particles, such a term is generated by the multiplication of the photon\npropagator (proportional to 1/q2 ) with the zero-component of the transition current which is given for a\nspin-1/2 particle as [see equation (4) of [40]]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq2\ni \u03c3 * p\u2032 \u00d7 p\n\u2032 0\n\u2217\n1\u2212\n\u016b \u03b3 \u016b = w\nw.\n(4.17)\n+\n8 m2\n4 m2\nHere, u is the bispinor amplitude for the bound particle, and w is the bound-state Schr\u00f6dinger wave\nfunction related by\n\u0013 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u0012\np2\n\uf8ec 1 \u2212 8 m2 w \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(4.18)\nu=\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u03c3*p\n2m w\n\naccording to equation (3) of [40]. One might wonder why a term proportional to \u03b4l0 , apparently generated\nby a \u03b4-function in coordinate space, prevails in the Breit energy (4.15). This term arises naturally when\n59\n\n\fevaluating a matrix element of the structure h\u03c6S |(r * (r * p\u0302) p\u0302)/r3 |\u03c6S i (last term of equation (4.14)) on\nthe nonrelativistic wave function \u03c6S and should not be associated with the zitterbewegung.\nVacuum polarization corrections and the self energy, as well as corrections due to the strong interaction,\nare not included in (4.15). These corrections will be discussed in the two following sections.\n\n4.4\n\nVacuum Polarization Effects\n\nAs pointed out by various authors (e.g. [5, 7, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138]), the electronic vacuum polarization\nenters already at the order of \u03b13 [more precisely, \u03b1 (Z\u03b1)2 ] in bound systems with spinless particles,\nbecause the spinless particles are much heavier than the electron, which means that the Bohr radius of\nthe bound system is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the Compton wavelength of the electron.\nThe Compton wavelength of the electron, however, is the fundamental length scale at which the charge\nof any bound particle is screened by the electronic vacuum polarization.\nThe vacuum polarization (VP) correction to energy levels has been evaluated [5, 6, 134, 136, 137, 138]\nwith nonrelativistic wave functions. We recall that the leading-order VP correction (due to the Uehling\npotential) can be expressed as\n\u03b1\n\u2206E = h\u03c8|VU |\u03c8i = CE E\u03c8 ,\n(4.19)\n\u03c0\nwhere\n(Z \u03b1)2 m\n(4.20)\nE\u03c8 = \u2212\n4 n2\nis the Schr\u00f6dinger binding energy for a two-body system with two particles each of mass m [first term on\nthe right-hand side of (4.15)]. For the CE coefficients, we recall the following known results [6, 136, 137],\nCE (1S) = 0.22 ,\n\nCE (2S) = 0.10 .\n\n(4.21)\n\nTwo-loop vacuum polarization effects enter at a relative order \u03b12 in pionium and are therefore of the\nsame order of magnitude as the relativistic corrections mediated by the Breit interaction (discussed in\nSec. 4.3). The self energy correction which is discussed in the following section is even smaller, but of\nconsiderable theoretical interest.\n\n4.5\n\nEffects due to Scalar QED\n\nAs shown in [102], the leading logarithmic correction to the self energy can be obtained, in nonrelativistic\napproximation, from second-order perturbation theory based on nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics [104] (see also [103]). We will investigate here, in a systematic way, the leading logarithms generated\nfor S states by self energy and relativistic-recoil effects (the so-called Salpeter correction), and show that\nthese are spin-independent.\nThe quantized electromagnetic field is [see Eq. (5) of [102]],\nh\ni\nX Z\nd3 k\np\n\u01eb\u03bb (k) a+ exp(\u2212ik * r) + ak,\u03bb exp(ik * r) ,\nA(r) =\nk,\u03bb\n(2\u03c0)3 2k\n\u03bb=1,2\n\n(4.22)\n\nand the nonrelativistic interaction hamiltonian for an atomic system with two spinless particles (charges\ne1 and e2 and masses m1 and m2 ) reads\nHI = \u2212\n\ne1\ne2\ne2\ne2\np1 * A(r1 ) + 1 A(r 1 )2 \u2212\np2 * A(r 2 ) + 2 A(r2 )2 .\nm1\n2m1\nm2\n2m2\n\n(4.23)\n\nFor two spin-1/2 particles, the terms\n\u2212\n\ne2\ne1\n\u03c3 1 * B(r 1 ) \u2212\n\u03c3 2 * B(r 2 )\nm1\nm2\n\n(4.24)\n\nhave to be added to HI [see Eq. (7) of [102]]. We will carry out the calculations for the general case of\none particle of charge e1 = e and the other having a charge e2 = \u2212Ze (we follow the convention of [34]\n60\n\n\fthat for hydrogen, e is the physical charge of the electron, i.e. e = \u2212|e|). The unperturbed hamiltonian\nof the system of the two particles and the electromagnetic field reads [see e.g. Eq. (6) of [102]],\nX Z\np2\np2\nZ\u03b1\nH0 = 1 + 2 \u2212\n+\nd3 k k a+\n(4.25)\nk,\u03bb ak,\u03bb .\n2m1\n2m2\nr\n\u03bb=1,2\n\nwhere r = r 1 \u2212 r2 . The eigenstates of the \"atomic part\" H0A of this hamiltonian in the center-ofmass system p1 + p2 = 0 are the nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Coulomb wave functions for a reduced\nmass mr = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ) [here, the \"atomic part\" H0A excludes the photon field, i.e. the last term\nof (4.25)]. We denote p \u2261 p1 = \u2212p2 .\n\nGiven that the first-order perturbation h\u03c6S |HI |\u03c6S i vanishes, the second-order perturbation yields the\ndominant nonvanishing perturbation. When evaluated on an atomic state, it is given by\n\u03b4ESE = h\u03c6S |HI\n\n1\nHI |\u03c6S i .\nH0 \u2212 ES\n\n(4.26)\n\nThe interaction hamiltonian (4.23) gives rise to QED corrections that involve both particles (in the\ncurrent context, these are recoil corrections involving the product e1 e2 ), and also to terms which involve\nonly a single particle and are proportional to e21 or e22 . The latter effects correspond to the self-energies\nof the two particles.\nThe low-energy part of the self energy in leading order [32] can be inferred directly from (4.26), and it can\nbe seen that the spin-dependent parts from (4.24) vanish in leading order in the (Z\u03b1)-expansion [102]:\n\u001d\n\u001c\nZ \u01eb\ne2\n1\np\np\nEL = \u2212 12\n\u03c6\n+ (e1 \u2194 e2 , m1 \u2194 m2 ) .\n(4.27)\ndk k \u03c6\n6\u03c0 0\nm1 H0A \u2212 (ES \u2212 k) m1\nwhere\n\n(Z\u03b1)2 mr\n(4.28)\n2n2\nis the Schr\u00f6dinger energy (mr in the reduced mass of the atomic system under investigation). Starting\nfrom the spin-independent expression (4.27), it is now relatively straightforward to show that the leading\n\"self energy logarithm\" for S states is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\n3\n4 ln(Z\u03b1)\u22122\n4 mr\n5 mr\n\u03b1\n(Z\u03b1)\n\u03b4ESE \u2248\n.\n(4.29)\n\u03b4\n+\nZ\n(Z\u03b1)\nl0\n3 \u03c0 n3\nm21\nm22\nES = \u2212\n\nThis result is by consequence spin-independent. The derivation is simplified when using the \u01eb-method\ndeveloped and used in various bound-state calculations [1, 2, 32]. The two terms in square brackets\nin (4.29) correspond to the two self-energies of the two constituent particles with charges e1 = e and\ne2 = \u2212Ze and masses m1 and m2 , respectively. It has been pointed out [97] that in contrast to the self\nenergy corrections, the vacuum polarization corrections given in Eq. (4.21) must not be double-counted.\nThe \"double-counting\" of self energy corrections (and lack of it in the vacuum-polarization case) finds\na natural explanation in our formalism: whereas the vacuum-polarization correction mainly leads to a\nmodification of the 1/r-type Coulomb attraction in (4.25) within a nonrelativistic effective theory, the\nstructure of the interaction hamiltonian (4.23) implies the existence of the two self-energies of the two\nconstituent particles of the atomic system.\nIt might be instructive to point out that the formula (4.29) is consistent with Welton's argument for\nestimating the self energy of a bound particle which is based on analyzing the influence of the fluctuating\nelectromagnetic field [a detailed discussion is given on pp. 80\u201382 of [34]]. For a system with two particles\nof equal mass m1 = m2 = m, we have mr = m/2.\nThe leading-order recoil correction (Salpeter correction) can also be inferred from the interaction hamiltonian (4.23) via second-order perturbation theory, by \"picking up\" terms that involve products e1 e2 .\nIt has been shown in [102] that the leading logarithm (for S states) of the Salpeter correction is spinindependent (just like the leading logarithm of the self energy correction). The Salpeter correction is\nusually referred to as a relativistic recoil (RR) correction. By following [102], we obtain for the leading\nlogarithm of this effect\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 (Z\u03b1)5\nm3r\n1\n\u03b4ERR \u2248\n\u03b4\nln\n.\n(4.30)\nl0\n3 \u03c0 n3\nZ\u03b1 m1 m2\n61\n\n\fThis correction involves only the products e1 e2 = \u22124\u03c0Z\u03b1 and can therefore be written as a function of\nZ\u03b1 alone.\nFor pionium, we have Z = 1, m1 = m2 = m = m\u03c0 , mr = m\u03c0 /2. The leading logarithmic correction from\nscalar QED for pionium in the order of \u03b15 ln \u03b1 is obtained by adding the corrections (4.29) and (4.30),\n\u0012 \u0013\n3 \u03b15\n1\n\u03b4Elog = \u03b4ESE + \u03b4ERR =\nm\u03c0 .\n(4.31)\nln\n4 \u03c0 n3\n\u03b1\nThe non-logarithmic term of order \u03b15 is spin-dependent, and its evaluation requires a relativistic treatment\nof the self energy of a bound spinless particle; such a calculation would be of considerable theoretical\ninterest, but the size of the effect for pionium, which is roughly two orders of \u03b1 smaller than the leading\nvacuum polarization correction, precludes experimental verification in the near future. However, we would\nlike to point out here that a fully relativistic treatment of this problem, including a detailed discussion\nof the renormalization of the self energy of the spinless particle, has not yet been accomplished. Scalar\nQED is a renormalizable theory [34].\nThe dominance of vacuum polarization over the self energy in pionium is expressed, in particular, by\nthe fact that even two-loop vacuum polarization of order \u03b14 has a stronger effect on the spectrum of\npionium than the leading logarithm from Eq. (4.31) according to Ref. [17], and that the strong-interaction\ncorrection of order \u03b13 [139] has to be well understood before any experimental verification of (4.31) appears\nfeasible. Finally, we remark that for a manifestly non-elementary particle like the pion which has a finite\ncharge radius, form-factor corrections have to be taken into account.\n\n62\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nQED Calculations: A Summary\nCalculations in the area of bound-state quantum electrodynamics have a long history, starting with Hans\nBethe's first evaluation of the hydrogen Lamb shift [33]. Since then, the field has developed considerably,\nand the immense progress in high-resolution spectroscopy (for a recent culmination of the activities,\nsee [42]) has necessitated the inclusion of higher- and higher-order corrections into the theoretical framework, leading to increased complexity of the theoretical calculations. Why should such an effort be carried\nout? A more accurate understanding of the QED corrections is of crucial importance for the determination of the fundamental constants and the test of quantum electrodynamics. The theory of the QED\nbound states can, at little risk to over-statement, be described as one the most developed theories in all\nof physics. It combines the intricacies of quantum field theory (divergences, renormalization) with the\nexperimental possibilities implied by the accuracy of high-resolution spectroscopy.\nFor decades, there has been a tremendous amount of work on analytic self-energy calculations, notably\non the coefficient A60 for S states. However, an accurate comparison of the analytic results to numerical\ndata was impossible, simply because no numerical data were available in the region of low nuclear charge.\nThe semi-analytic expansion in Z\u03b1 is in part problematic because there is evidence that it may represent\na divergent series. This argument may be based in part on the analogy between Figs. 5.1 and 5.2, and\non the observed rapid growth of the analytic self energy coefficients (A40 is of order one for S states,\nA50 is about 10, and the magnitude of A60 is as large as 30). The QED effective action gives rise to a\ndivergent asymptotic expansion in appropriately defined effective coupling parameters. It is therefore a\npriori difficult to associate a finite remainder to a truncated series that involves all known (but disregards\nthe unknown) analytic coefficients.\nThe results reported here in Ch. 1 answer this conceptual question in the following way: the semi-analytic\nexpansion in powers of Z\u03b1 is in full agreement with the obtained numerical results. We may therefore\nconclude that the semi-analytic expansion probably gives rise to a generalized asymptotic series whose\nremainder is of the order of the first neglected semi-analytic term as Z\u03b1 \u2192 0. Therefore, we may assume\nthat a truncated semi-analytic expansion in powers of Z\u03b1 leads to reliable theoretical predictions in the\nrealm of low nuclear charge numbers Z. However, although the numerical results confirm the validity\nof the semi-analytic expansion in this Z-region, they also show the limitations of this approach: much\nmore accurate results are obtainable by numerical calculations. The accuracy on the level of 1 Hz for\natomic hydrogen reported in Ch. 1 would have involved analytic terms of an excessively high order in Z\u03b1\n[approximately \u03b1 (Z\u03b1)9 )], and the multitude and complexity of terms would have been a severe obstacle\nfor analytic calculations in this order of Z\u03b1. In general, the related activities have recently sparked a\nrather broad interest in the numerical calculation of relativistic, QED self energy and two-body corrections\nat low Z and the comparison of analytic and numerical results [87, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147,\n148, 149, 150, 151].\nWe have described in Ch. 1 a nonperturbative evaluation of the one-photon self energy in hydrogenlike ions\nwith low nuclear charge numbers Z = 1 to 5. The general outline of our approach is discussed in Sec. 1.3.\nIn Sec. 1.4, the numerical evaluation of the low-energy part (generated by virtual photons of low energy)\nis described. In Sec. 1.5, we discuss the numerical evaluation of the high-energy part, which is generated\nby high-energy virtual photons and contains the formally infinite contributions, which are removed by\nthe renormalization. Sec. 1.5 also contains a brief discussion of the convergence acceleration methods\n63\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\u0005\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n:::\n\nFigure 5.1: Expansion of the bound electron self energy in powers of the binding Coulomb field.\nThe dashed lines denote Coulomb photons, the crosses denote the interaction with the (external)\nbinding field. Each interaction with the binding Coulomb field gives rise to a higher-order term in\nthe Z\u03b1-expansion.\n\nas employed in the current evaluation. We discuss in Sec. 1.6 the comparison of analytic and numerical\ndata for K- and L-shell states in the region of low Z. The main results of the current investigation are\ncontained in Table 1.5: numerical data, nonperturbative in Z\u03b1, for the scaled function F and the self\nenergy remainder function GSE for K- and L-shell states at low nuclear charge. The numerical accuracy\nof our data is 1 Hz or better in frequency units for 1S, 2S and both 2P states in atomic hydrogen.\nStill, calculations within the semi-analytic expansion in addition to the numerical calculations (a kind of\n\"dual strategy\") remain important. They serve as a confirmation and check for currently available and\nfuture numerical approaches. In general, in view of the complexity of the calculations, an independent\ncheck is always highly desirable. For the two-loop effect, the (Z\u03b1)-expansion converges more rapidly than\nfor the one-loop effect in absolute frequency units because of the additional radiative factor \u03b1/\u03c0 which\ndecreases the overall size of the effect (see Ch. 3).\nIt is hoped that the analytic calculations reported in Ch. 3 for low nuclear charge number Z will be supplemented in the future by an accurate numerical treatment of the two-loop self energy problem (see also\nrelated recent work in the high-Z region, Refs. [13, 151, 152]). This presupposes that the considerable numerical problems in the domain of small nuclear charge could be solved by adequate numerical methods,\nand that the further problem of the increased computational demand of the two-loop effect in comparison\nto the one-loop problem [9, 12] can be tackled \u2013 possibly by massively parallel computer architectures.\nNote, however, that the most accurate theoretical predictions could only be reached in combining numerical and analytic results. The reason is the following: All numerical calculations are performed in the\nnon-recoil limit which is the limit of infinite nuclear mass. This is not quite sufficient for an accurate\ntheoretical treatment because the self energy of a bound-state depends genuinely on the ratio of the orbiting particle to the nuclear mass \u2013 an effect beyond the recoil correction. For example, the argument of\nthe logarithms in Eqs. (1.2) and (3.1) should be replaced according to ln[(Z\u03b1)\u22122 ] \u2192 ln[\u03c3 (Z\u03b1)\u22122 ], where\n\u03c3 = m/mr and mr is the reduced mass [97]. The possibility to include these tiny, but important effects\n\n64\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\u0005\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n:::\n\nFigure 5.2: Expansion of the QED effective action in powers of the external field. As discussed\nin Sec. 8.3.2, the resulting asymptotic series in powers of the coupling is divergent.\n\ndepends crucially on a reliable knowledge of the analytic coefficients in combination with an accurate\nnumerical treatment of the problem (see also the discussion in Sec. 2.6).\nThe analytic results can be used to obtain improved theoretical predictions for the hydrogenic fine structure as compared to the previous order\u2013\u03b17\u2013calculations [1, 2], because they remove the principal theoretical uncertainty in the order of \u03b18 due to the problematic two-loop self energy which is represented\ndiagrammatically in Fig. 3.1. Our calculation in Ch. 3 illustrates the usefulness of the simplified effective\ntreatments of two-loop effects in the analytic approach based on the modified Dirac hamiltonian (3.3)\nand the \"\u01eb method\". This aspect highlights, as we believe, the need for systematic, simplified treatments\nof higher-order radiative corrections in bound systems.\nIn Ch. 3, we primarily address spin-dependent effects in one-electron (hydrogenlike) systems. However,\nthe same effects also contribute to the fine-structure splitting in two-electron (heliumlike) systems. There\nis currently remarkable interest in improved measurements of the fine-structure splitting in helium and\nheliumlike atomic systems with low nuclear charge [36, 37, 38, 39]. The effects addressed here contribute\nto the fine-structure splitting in helium on the level of 100 Hz, which is not much smaller than the\ncurrent experimental accuracy of about 1 kHz, and allows for an estimate of uncalculated higher-order\ncontributions.\nAll analytic calculations rely on the separation of the virtual photon energy into high- and low-energy\nenergy regions via a parameter \u01eb. This separation is illustrated in Sec. 2.2. For two-photon problems,\nfour energy regions result from such a separation, but for the one-photon problem discussed in Ch. 2,\none separation parameter \u01eb is sufficient. We present in Ch. 2 analytic calculations for excited atomic\nstates based on the semi-analytic Z\u03b1-expansion. These may be complemented in the near future by\nnumerical results [95]. We discuss some intricacies of the analytic treatment of highly excited atomic\nstates in Sec. 2.1. Results for the individual contributions are presented in Subsections 2.3.1 \u2013 2.3.8\nand summarized in Sec. 2.4. Final values of the analytic coefficients can be found in Tables 2.1 \u2013 2.7.\nThe characteristic numerical cancellations between individual contributions are described in Sec. 2.5.\nFinally, in Sec. 2.6, we describe a number of observations regarding the dependence of the A61 and the\n65\n\n\fA60 -coefficients on the quantum numbers of the atomic state.\nAll of the above calculations are related to the bound electron, which is a spin-1/2 particle. In nature,\nparticles with different spin quantum numbers exist, and these, too, can form bound systems. The spindependence of the corrections is a conceptually interesting issue that forms the subject of Ch. 4. This\ninterest is sparked by the projected DIRAC experiment at CERN where the bound system of two oppositely charged pions (\"pionium\") will be studied. Notably, even the relativistic corrections for a bound\ntwo-body system consisting of spinless particles are different for spinless particles than for particles with\nnonvanishing spin. They are given by a generalized Breit hamiltonian that we discuss in Sec. 4.3. There,\nwe present a simplified derivation for the relativistic and recoil corrections of order \u03b14 to a bound state of\ntwo spinless particles. The results agree with previous calculations [129]. As evident from equation (4.14),\nthe zitterbewegung term is absent in a bound system of two spinless particles.\nThe self energy is suppressed in systems with spinless particles in comparison to the vacuum polarization\neffect as discussed in Secs. 4.4 and 4.5, because the lightest known spinless particle is much heavier than\nthe electron, which implies that the vacuum polarization effect is larger by two orders of Z\u03b1 than the self\nenergy in bound systems of spinless particles. We provide a complete result for the leading scalar-QED\ncorrection of order \u03b15 ln \u03b1 in Sec. 4.5. A list of further QED corrections to the 1S level of pionium,\nincluding two-loop vacuum polarization, finite-size corrections and other effects, can be found in [17].\nTo conclude this Chapter, we would like to mention the complementarity of the high-precision calculations\nand experiments at low nuclear charge and the strong-field calculations and related experiments at high\nnuclear charge numbers. While an accuracy [42] of one part in 1014 currently appears to be out of reach for\nhydrogenlike Uranium [153], the experiments on highly charged ions have meanwhile attained a precision\nwhere a detailed understanding of the nuclear structure and shape is necessary in order to describe QED\neffects rigorously [154].\nBound systems described by quantum electrodynamics belong to the most accurately understood physical\nsystems today. They convey a certain esthetic appeal because the apparent simplicity of the two- and\nthree-particle systems gives rise to a large number of conceptual as well as calculational difficulties when\na thorough understanding is sought in higher orders of perturbation theory.\n\n66\n\n\fPart II\n\nConvergence Acceleration and\nDivergent Series\n\n67\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nIntroduction to Convergence\nAcceleration and Divergent Series in\nPhysics\nThe second part of this thesis will be concerned with convergence acceleration methods and with the\nsummation of divergent series. In theoretical physics, we often encounter sequences of numbers, either as\na result of perturbation theory or as partial sums of an infinite series defining a physical quantity, whose\nnumerical properties are disfavourable: in many cases, the sequences converge so slowly that they are\nnumerically useless. In other cases, the sequences do not converge at all, and yet we know \u2013 or assume \u2013\nthat the sequences are associated, nevertheless, to the physical quantity in question, for example in the\nform of a divergent asymptotic expansion.\nLet us consider the case where the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 under investigation is given by partial sums of an\ninfinite series,\nn\nX\nsn =\nak .\n(6.1)\nk=0\n\nWe assume, furthermore, that the ak are real (this condition will be relaxed in the sequel).\n\n(i) Let us assume that the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 is convergent. The purpose of convergence acceleration is to\n\u2032 \u221e\ninto\na\nnew\nsequence\n{s\nconvert {sn }\u221e\nn }n=0 with hopefully better numerical properties. If we denote\nn=0\nthe limit of the sequence by s, that is s \u2261 limn\u2192\u221e sn , then the rate of convergence is obviously increased\nif\ns\u2032 \u2212 s\n= 0.\n(6.2)\nlim n\nn\u2192\u221e sn \u2212 s\n(ii) Alternatively, let us assume that the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 is divergent. The purpose of the resummation\nis to determine the generalized limit (or antilimit) of the sequence. The following question immediately\narises: how is it possible to associate a finite generalized limit with a divergent series. L. Euler wrote in a\nletter to Goldbach (1745): \"Summa cuiusque seriei est valor expressionis illius finitae, ex cuius evolutione\nilla series oritur.\", which means: the generalized limit of any divergent series is the value of the particular\ncharacteristic finite expression, whose expansion gives rise to the divergent series. This is still the main\nnotion of resummation today: Given a divergent series, to \"reconstruct\" a posteriori the function whose\nexpansion gave rise to the divergent series, with a suitable mathematical resummation method.\nWe illustrate this idea with a trivial\nP\u221e example: A divergent series can be generated, e.g., by expanding\nthe function f (z) = 1/(1 + z) \u223c j=0 (\u2212z)j at z = 1 in powers of z. The partial sums of the resulting\ndivergent series read\n\uf8f1\nn\n\uf8f2 1 for n even\nX\n.\n(6.3)\n(\u22121)j =\nsn =\n\uf8f3 0 for n odd\nj=0\n\nThe resulting sequence, which is 1, 0, 1, 0, . . . , can be identified as originating from the discussed function\nby expansion at unit argument, and its antilimit is therefore 1/2 . Since this argument may not sound\n68\n\n\fconvincing, let us briefly indicate that the result may also be obtained by imposing the postulate that\nthe antilimit of the sum of two divergent series should be the sum P\nof the two antilimits each. Then, it\nj\nis easy to derive (by inspection) that the antilimit a of the series \u221e\nj=0 (\u22121) should fulfill 1 \u2212 a = a,\n1\nand thus a = /2 (again). A more formal investigation of this series and its resummation can be found\nin [155] [see Eq. (1.1.1) and the instructive discussion on the p. 6 ibid.]. It is probably a triviality to\nexpress that the most familiar resummation methods like the Euler transformation, Pad\u00e9 approximants\nand recently developed nonlinear sequence transformations of the Levin\u2013Weniger type all convert the\ndivergent sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, . . . to the convergent sequence 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 , . . . , in mutual agreement.\nSome of these resummation methods are discussed in the sequel, and we also refer the reader to the\nseminal review [156]. It has been stressed in J. E. Littlewood's introduction to [155] that the subject of\ndivergent series is in no way \"mystical or unrigorous\".\nFundamental differences exist between nonalternating series (without loss of generality we can assume\nak > 0 \u2200k in that case), and strictly alternating series ak = (\u22121)k bk where bk > 0 \u2200k (mixed forms will\nalso be discussed in the sequel). The acceleration of the convergence and the summation of divergent\nnonalternating series has been historically problematic.\nFor example, it has been known for a long time that the acceleration of nonalternating slowly convergent\nseries can be highly unstable numerically (see [156] and references therein). Likewise, the summation of\nnonalternating factorially divergent series has represented a considerable problem, because the series are\ntypically non\u2013Borel summable (see [157, 158, 159, 160] for suitable generalizations of the concept of Borel\nsummability which provide solutions for large classes of problems of practical interest).\nRecently, considerable progress has been achieved for the nonalternating case, and we will describe some\nof the relevant applications. For the acceleration of convergence of nonalternating series, new powerful algorithms have been devised [23], and generalizations of the Borel summation process have led to\npromising results in the case of nonalternating factorially divergent series [25, 27, 28].\nOne would intuitively assume that the perturbation series, even if it is divergent, should be associated to\nthe physical quantity of interest in a more or less unique way. Unfortunately, many divergent series and\nthe associated physical observables (e.g., energy levels as a function of the coupling strength) fail to fulfill\nthe Carleman criterion [161] which guarantees that an asymptotic series can be uniquely associated to a\ngiven mathematical function. It appears that some ambiguity has to accepted as far as the connection\nbetween perturbation theory and physical quantities is concerned, although some attempts have been\nmade to resolve ambiguities in particular cases (see e.g. [162]).\nFor completeness, we give here the Carleman criterion which guarantees that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a function and its associated asymptotic series (see for example [163], Theorems\nXII.17 \u2013 XII.19 and the definition on p. 43 in [164], p. 410 in [165], or the comprehensive and elucidating\nreview [166]):\nCarleman Criterion. Let f (z) be a function which is analytic in the interior\nand continuous on a sectorial region S = {z|| arg(z)| \u2264 k \u03c0/2 + \u01eb, 0 < |z| < R}\nof the complex planePfor some \u01eb > 0. Let the function f have an asymptotic\n\u221e\nn\nexpansion f (z) \u223c\nn=0 cn z (for z \u2192 0). The function f obeys a strong\nasymptotic conditionP\n(of order k) if there are suitable positive constants C and\nn\nm+1\n\u03c3 such that |f (z) \u2212 m\n[k (m + 1)]! |z|m+1 holds for all m\nn=0 cn z | \u2264 C \u03c3\nand for all z \u2208 S. The validity of such a condition implies that the function\nf (z) is uniquely determined by its asymptotic series.\nTypically, nonalternating factorially divergent series which entail nonperturbative (imaginary) contributions do not fulfill the Carleman condition. This failure gives rise to the inevitable ambiguities.\nEven the generalized Borel resummation methods introduced in [157, 158, 159, 160] cannot provide\nconclusive answers for all possible physical scenarios. One highly problematic application is given by the\nquantum-mechanical double-well oscillator. The perturbation series for the ground state (as well as for\nany other unperturbed state) is divergent. Yet it is known that the ground state splits into two states of\nopposite parity when the second minimum of the potential approaches the first from infinity [167, 168].\nThe interesting observation is that two distinct quantum states are described by one and the same\nperturbation series. The energy difference is nonperturbative in the coupling and cannot be inferred in\n69\n\n\fprinciple from perturbation theory. The problem has been the subject of intensive discussion [169, 170,\n171, 172, 173, 174]. The resulting multi-instanton expansion has recently found a more mathematically\nmotivated explanation in the theory of resurgent functions [175, 176, 177].\nWe conclude this introduction by expressing that convergence acceleration and resummation methods\ncannot be separated. The connection can be seen as follows. We consider the remainders rn \u2261 sn \u2212 s,\ni.e. the difference of the element sn of the sequence and the limit s. The acceleration of convergence is\nachieved by eliminating, as far as possible, the remainders rn from a necessarily finite set of input data\n\u2032\n{sn }m\nn=0 , in order to obtain a better estimate sm to s than the obvious estimate which would be provided\nby sm . Clearly, the \"elimination of remainders\" is a concept which can be transported to the case of a\ndivergent series. The only difference is that for a convergent series, rn \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e, whereas for a\ndivergent series, limn\u2192\u221e rn does not exist. Otherwise, the concept of the elimination of remainders is the\nsame for both cases.\nReturning to our (simple) example, it is intuitively obvious that a method which helps to eliminate the\nremainders\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212z)n+1\n(\u2212z)j =\n(6.4)\nrn =\n1+z\nj=n+1\ninside the circle of convergence |z| < 1, could be suitable to accomplish an analogous\nelimination of\nP\u221e\nthe rn if z assumes values outside of the domain of convergence of the series j=0 (\u2212z)j because the\nmathematical structure of the expression which defines rn does not change. These entirely heuristic\nconsiderations will be illustrated and explained in the sequel.\n\n70\n\n\fChapter 7\n\nConvergence Acceleration\n7.1\n7.1.1\n\nThe Concept of Convergence Acceleration\nA Brief Survey\n\nWe intend to give a brief overview of the convergence acceleration methods used in this Thesis, without\nany claim for completeness or comprehensiveness with regard to currently known convergence acceleration\ntechniques. Indeed, excellent textbooks (e.g. [178, 179, 180]) and review articles [156, 181, 182, 183, 184]\non the subject are available. Here, we focus on aspects of the methods which will become useful for the\napplications discussed in later Chapters of the Thesis.\nThis brief introduction is structured as follows: After a discussion of basic concepts (Secs. 7.1.2 and 7.1.3),\nwe introduce Pad\u00e9 approximants (one of the standard mathematical tools for extrapolation and convergence acceleration) in Sec. 7.1.4. Next, we discuss nonlinear sequence transformations in Sec. 7.1.5. Both\nof these convergence acceleration methods are much more powerful and much more numerically stable\nin the case of alternating input series than in the case of input series whose terms have the same sign\n(nonalternating series). We conclude in Sec. 7.1.6 with a discussion of the recently proposed [23] combined\nnonlinear-condensation transformation (CNCT) which provides an efficient algorithm in the historically\nproblematic case of nonalternating input series.\nBefore we start the discussion of Pad\u00e9 approximants and nonlinear sequence transformations, we would\nlike to mention that a large number of other convergence acceleration methods exist which have all been\ndocumented in the literature: examples include the Euler transformation, Aitken's \u22062 process, the iterated\n\u22062 process, and Richardson extrapolation which can be implemented using Wynn's rho algorithm, and\nits iterations. Last, but not least, we mention the Euler\u2013Maclaurin sum formula. The interested reader\nwill find related information e.g. in Chs. 5 and 6 of [156], App. E.2 of [43], and in Eq. (3.6.28) ff. of [185].\nConcerning the mutual differences between the Pad\u00e9 method (Sec. 7.1.4 and nonlinear sequence transformations (Sec. 7.1.5), we would like to expand: Given a formal series\nP(z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ncj z j\n\n(7.1)\n\nj=0\n\nas input, the Pad\u00e9 method produces rational approximants which depend exclusively on a finite subset of\nthe coefficients {cj }\u221e\nj=0 , which in turn determine the partial sums of (7.1). Nonlinear sequence transformations require, inPaddition to the partial sums of (7.1), also explicit remainder estimates, i.e. estimates\n\u221e\nfor the remainder j=n+1 cj z j which remains after the summation of the first n terms of (7.1).\n\nThus, the remainder estimates introduce additional degrees of freedom in the construction of sequence\ntransformations as compared to Pad\u00e9 approximants. As pointed out in [26], one may draw an analogy\nbetween sequence transformations and Pad\u00e9 approximants on the one hand and the Gaussian integration\nand the Simpson rule on the other hand; the variable integration nodes and weight factors of the Gaussian\nintegration yield additional degrees of freedom which may be used in order to construct a potentially\nmuch more powerful algorithm for numerical integration.\n71\n\n\fExcept for the additional degrees of freedom, nonlinear sequence transformations have additional advantages. For example, the delta transformation to be discussed in Sec. 7.1.5 gave very good results in the\ncase of the sextic anharmonic oscillator, and there is strong numerical evidence that it is able to sum the\nextremely violently divergent perturbation series for the octic anharmonic oscillator [186]. By contrast, as\ndiscussed in [186], Pad\u00e9 approximants are apparently not powerful enough to sum divergent series whose\ncoefficients diverge like (2n)! or even (3n)!. These observations stimulated research on sequence transformations considerably. The rapid progress in this field is convincingly demonstrated by the large number\nof monographs [180, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195] and review articles [156, 196, 197, 198]\nwhich appeared in recent years.\n\n7.1.2\n\nThe Forward Difference Operator\n\nAn essential ingredient in the construction of sequence transformations, both for convergence acceleration\nand for the resummation of divergent series, is the (forward) difference operator. We define the difference\noperator \u2206 acting on the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 :\n\u221e\n\u2206 : {sn }\u221e\nn=0 \u2192 {(\u2206s)n }n=0 , (\u2206s)n \u2261 sn+1 \u2212 sn ,\n\n(7.2)\n\nThe nth element of the sequence {(\u2206s)n }\u221e\nn=0 is given by (\u2206s)n = sn+1 \u2212 sn . This way of writing the nth\nelement of the transformed sequence stresses the fact that (\u2206s)n is to be regarded as an element of some\nnew sequence. However, the brackets are often left out, and we write\n\u2206sn \u2261 sn+1 \u2212 sn = (\u2206s)n .\n\n(7.3)\n\nAn important relation is,\nk\nX\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nk\nsn+j .\n(\u22121)\n(\u2206 s)n = (\u22121)\nj\nj=0\n\n(7.4)\n\n\u2206k sn \u2261 (\u2206k s)n .\n\n(7.5)\n\nk\n\nk\n\nj\n\nAgain, we identify\nThe kth power of the difference operator plays a crucial rule in constructing sequence transformations.\n\n7.1.3\n\nLinear and Logarithmic Convergence\n\nAs already stressed in Ch. 6, the main notion of convergence acceleration is to extract information \"hidden\nin trailing digits\" from a necessarily finite number of sequence elements, in order to convert a sequence\n\u2032 \u221e\n{sn }\u221e\nn=0 into a new sequence {sn }n=0 with hopefully better numerical properties.\n\nWe briefly recall the notion of logarithmic convergence and the difficulties associated with the acceleration\nof the convergence of nonalternating series. Let a sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 fulfill the asymptotic condition\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nsn+1 \u2212 s\n= \u03c1,\nsn \u2212 s\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere s = s\u221e is the limit of the sequence as n \u2192 \u221e. If \u03c1 > 1, then the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 is divergent.\nFor \u03c1 = 1, the sequence may either be convergent or divergent. A convergent sequence with \u03c1 = 1 is\ncalled logarithmically convergent (if \u03c1 < 1, the series is called linearly convergent). Let us further assume\nthat the elements of the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 in Eq. (7.6) represent partial sums\nsn =\n\nn\nX\n\na(k)\n\n(7.7)\n\nk=0\n\nof an infinite series. Here, we will almost exclusively investigate slowly convergent nonalternating sequences {sn }\u221e\nn=0 whose elements are all real and positive (for these sequences, 0 < \u03c1 \u2264 1). In the case of\nslow convergence, \u03c1 is either very close or equal to unity.\nAs observed by many authors (e.g. [156]), the acceleration of the convergence of nonalternating sequences\nis a potentially unstable numerical process. The reason is the following: A sequence transformation can\n72\n\n\fonly accelerate convergence if it succeeds in extracting additional information about the index-dependence\nof the truncation errors\nrn = sn \u2212 s\n(7.8)\n\nfrom a necessarily finite set of partial sums {sn }kn=0 of the input series. Normally, this is done by forming\narithmetic expressions involving higher weighted differences of the sn . The calculation of higher weighted\ndifferences is a potentially unstable process which can easily lead to a serious loss of numerical significance\ndue to cancellation if the input data all have the same sign.\nWe had mentioned in Ch. 6 that the rate of convergence can be said to be increased if the transformed\n\u221e\nsequence elements {s\u2032n }\u221e\nn=0 and the input data {sn }n=0 fulfill [see also Eq. (6.2)]\ns\u2032n \u2212 s\n= 0,\nn\u2192\u221e sn \u2212 s\n\n(7.9)\n\nlim \u03c4n \u2261 lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere we implicitly define the \u03c4n . Let us assume that the input sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 is logarithmically\n\u2032\n\u2032\nconvergent and that the transformed sequence {s\u2032n }\u221e\nn=0 is linearly convergent with limn\u2192\u221e (sn+1 \u2212s)/(sn \u2212\n\u2032\ns) = \u03c1 < 1 [see Eq. (7.6) and the definition of logarithmic convergence]. Then\ns\u2032\n\u2212 s sn \u2212 s\n\u03c4n+1\n\u2261 lim n+1\n= \u03c1\u2032 < 1 ,\nn\u2192\u221e s\u2032n \u2212 s sn+1 \u2212 s\nn\u2192\u221e \u03c4n\nlim\n\n(7.10)\n\nso that limn\u2192\u221e \u03c4n = 0, and the rate of convergence is increased [according to the definition of convergence\nacceleration in Eq. (7.9)].\n\n7.1.4\n\nThe Standard Tool: Pad\u00e9 Approximants\n\nThe Pad\u00e9 approximation produces a rational approximation to the original input series; this approximation is given by the ratio of two polynomials. The [l/m] Pad\u00e9 approximant to a series P(z),\n\u221e\nX\n\nP(z) =\n\ncj z j ,\n\n(7.11)\n\nj=0\n\nis given by the ratio of two polynomials Pl (z) and Qm (z) of degree l and m, respectively:\n[l/m]P (z) =\n\nPl (z)\np0 + p1 z + . . . + pl z l\n.\n=\nQm (z)\nq0 + q1 z + . . . + qm z m\n\n(7.12)\n\nThe polynomials Pl (z) and Qm (z) are constructed so that the Taylor expansion of the Pad\u00e9 approximation\nEq. (7.12) agrees with the original input series Eq. (7.11) up to the order of l + m\nP(z) \u2212 [l/m]P (z) = O(z l+m+1 ) .\n\n(7.13)\n\nIn other words, the Pad\u00e9 approximant [l/m]P (z) reproduces upon re-expansion the first l + m + 1\n(c0 , . . . , cl+m ) coefficients of the input series.\nUsually the normalization condition is choosen such as q0 is one. Hence there are l + m + 1 equations to\ndetermine the coefficients of Pl (z) and Qm (z). In most cases it is quite unattractive to solve this system\nof equations. A more attractive recursive prescription for the evaluation of Pad\u00e9 approximants is the\n\u01eb-algorithm given by the formulas [199]\n(n)\n\n\u01eb\u22121 = 0 ,\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n\u01eb0\n\n(n+1)\n\n\u01ebk+1 = \u01ebk\u22121\n\n= sn ,\n(n+1)\n\n+ 1/[\u01ebk\n\n(n)\n\n\u2212 \u01ebk ]\n\n(7.14)\n\nfor k and n integer. The \u01eb-algorithm is discussed in [199], and a detailed discussion of its implementation\n(n)\ncan be found in [156]. If the input data \u01eb0 = sn are the partial sums\nsn =\n\nn\nX\nj=0\n\n73\n\ncj z j\n\n(7.15)\n\n\f(n)\n\nof the power series Eq. (7.11), then the elements \u01eb2k of the two-dimensional table of transformations\nproduce Pad\u00e9 approximants according to\n(n)\n\n\u01eb2k = [n + k/k]P (z) .\n\n(7.16)\n\n(n)\n\nThe elements with odd lower subscripts \u01eb2k+1 of the table of transformations are only auxiliary quantities.\nIn practical applications (see e.g. Tables 1 \u2013 3 of [24]), the epsilon algorithm can be used for evaluation\nof the following staircase sequence in the Pad\u00e9 table:\n[0/0], [1/0], [1/1], [2/1], . . . , [\u03bd/\u03bd], [\u03bd + 1/\u03bd], [\u03bd + 1/\u03bd + 1], . . . .\n\n(7.17)\n\nBecause of Eq. (7.16) this corresponds to the sequence\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n\u01eb0 , \u01eb0 , \u01eb2 , \u01eb2 , \u01eb4 , \u01eb4 , \u01eb6 , . . . \u01eb2\u03bd , \u01eb2\u03bd , \u01eb2\u03bd+2 , . . . ,\n\n(7.18)\n\n(\u03bd\u22122[[\u03bd/2]])\n\n}\u221e\nwhich can be written as {\u01eb2[[\u03bd/2]]\n\u03bd=0 . Here [[\u03bd/2]] denotes the integral part of \u03bd/2, which is the largest\ninteger \u03bc satisfying \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd/2. With this notation the Pad\u00e9 sequence in Eq. (7.17) can also be written as\n{[\u03bd \u2212 [[\u03bd/2]]/[[\u03bd/2]]]P (z)}\u221e\n\u03bd=0 .\n\nModern computer algebra packages [90] contain built-in routines for the evaluation of Pad\u00e9 approximants.\nWhile these are computationally less effective than the epsilon algorithm, they are more flexible with regard to the degree of the numerator and denominator polynomials. In particular, the sequence allow for the\nevaluation of the sequence of lower-diagonal Pad\u00e9 approximants of the form {[[[\u03bd/2]]/\u03bd \u2212 [[\u03bd/2]]]P (z)}\u221e\n\u03bd=0 .\nAs already mentioned in Sec. 7.1.1, it is a typical feature of all algorithms for Pad\u00e9 approximants that the\ncoefficients c0 , c1 , . . . , cl+m of the formal power series (7.11) suffice to determine [l/m]P (g) completely.\nNo additional information is needed. At first sight, this seems to be very advantageous. However, there are\nsituations in which this apparent advantage becomes a disadvantage. For instance, the truncation error\nof an asymptotic power series which has the Stieltjes property is for real argument bounded in magnitude\nby the first term not included in the partial sum (see Example 9.3 on p. 92 of [91]). Accordingly, the\ntruncation error of a strictly alternating divergent hypergeometric series 2 F0 (\u03b1, \u03b2; \u2212x) with \u03b1, \u03b2, x > 0,\nwhich provides a good mathematical model for many divergent perturbation expansions, is bounded in\nmagnitude by the first term not included in the partial sum. In addition, the truncation error and the\nfirst term not included in the partial sum have the same sign (see Theorem 5.12-5 of [200]). In principle,\nthis information should be very helpful in summation processes. Unfortunately, Pad\u00e9 approximants are\nnot able to profit from it. This greatly reduces their efficiency if a divergent hypergeometric series 2 F0 of\nthat kind or a divergent perturbation series of a similar type is to be summed.\n\n7.1.5\n\nNonlinear Sequence Transformations\n\n\u221e\nA sequence transformation T is a rule which converts\nPn a slowly convergent or divergent sequence {sn }n=0\nwhose elements may be the partial sums sn =\nk=0 ak [see Eq. (6.1)] of an infinite series, into a new\nsequence {s\u2032n }\u221e\nn=0 with hopefully better numerical properties. Pad\u00e9 approximants, which were discussed\nin Section 7.1.4, are special sequence transformations since they transform the partial sums of a formal\npower series (7.11) into a doubly indexed sequence of rational approximants (7.17). In the current Section,\nalternative transformations will be discussed.\n\nLet us now assume that the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 of partial sums of an infinite series diverges but can be\nsummed to its generalized limit s. Then the sequence elements sn can for all integers n \u2265 0 be partitioned\ninto the generalized limit s and remainders rn :\nsn = s + rn .\n\n(7.19)\n\nIf {sn }\u221e\nn=0 diverges, then the remainders rn do not vanish as n \u2192 \u221e. A divergent sequence would be\nsummed to its generalized limit s if the remainders rn could somehow be eliminated from the sequence\nelements sn . For a slowly convergent sequence, one can hope to accelerate convergence by eliminating\napproximations to the rn obtained from a finite set of sequence elements which are used as input data\nfor the transformation.\n\n74\n\n\f\u2032 \u221e\nThe sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 is transformed into a new sequence {sn }n=0 , whose elements can for all n \u2265 0 be\npartitioned into the generalized limit s of the original sequence and a transformed remainder rn\u2032 :\n\ns\u2032n = s + rn\u2032 .\n\n(7.20)\n\nThis approximative elimination process can be termed successful if the transformed remainders rn\u2032 either\nvanish as n \u2192 \u221e (in the case of a divergent input sequence where the rn do not vanish at all as n \u2192 \u221e), or\nif the rn\u2032 vanish faster than the original remainders rn as n \u2192 \u221e [in the case of a slowly convergent input\nsequence, see also Eq. (7.9)]. A sequence transformation is a rule which transforms a slowly convergent\n\u2032 \u221e\nor divergent sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 into a new sequence {sn }n=0 with hopefully better numerical properties.\nHowever, the truncation errors of a divergent series can depend on n in a very complicated way. Consequently, the direct elimination of approximations to rn from sn can be very difficult. A considerable\nsimplification can often be achieved by means of a suitable reformulation. Let us consider the following\nmodel sequence (see Section 3.2 of [156]):\ns\u0303n = s\u0303 + \u03c9n zn .\n\n(7.21)\n\nHere, \u03c9n is a remainder estimate, which has to be chosen according to some rule and which may depend\non n in a very complicated way, and zn is a correction term, which should be chosen in such a way that\nit depends on n in a relatively smooth way. Moreover, the products \u03c9n zn should be capable of producing\nsufficiently accurate approximations to the actual remainders rn of the sequence to be transformed.\nThe principal advantage of this approach is that now only the correction terms {zn }\u221e\nn=0 have to be\ndetermined. The subsequent elimination of \u03c9n zn from sn is often much easier than the direct elimination\nof approximations to rn from sn . The use of remainder estimates {\u03c9n }\u221e\nn=0 is also an efficient way of\nincorporating additional information about the remainders into the summation scheme.\nThe model sequence (7.21) has another undisputable advantage: There is a systematic way of constructing\na sequence transformation which is exact for this model sequence. Let us assume that a linear operator T\u0302\ncan be found which annihilates the correction term zn . Then, a sequence transformation, which is exact\nfor the model sequence (7.21), can be constructed quite easily. Just apply T\u0302 to [s\u0303n \u2212 s\u0303]/\u03c9n = zn . Since\nT\u0302 annihilates zn according to T\u0302 (zn ) = 0 and is by assumption linear, we find that the following sequence\ntransformation T is exact for the model sequence (7.21) (see Eq. (3.2-11) of [156]):\nT (s\u0303n , \u03c9n ) =\n\nT\u0302 (s\u0303n /\u03c9n )\nT\u0302 (1/\u03c9n )\n\n= s\u0303 .\n\n(7.22)\n\nSimple and yet very powerful sequence transformations are obtained if the annihilation operators are\nbased upon the finite difference operator \u2206 defined in Sec. 7.1.2. A polynomial Pk\u22121 (n) of degree k \u2212 1\nin n is annihilated by the k-th power of \u2206. Thus, we now assume that the correction terms {zn }\u221e\nn=0 can\nbe chosen in such a way that multiplication of zn by some suitable quantity wk (n) yields a polynomial\nPk\u22121 (n) of degree k \u2212 1 in n:\nwk (n) zn = Pk\u22121 (n) .\n(7.23)\nSince \u2206k Pk\u22121 (n) = 0, the weighted difference operator T\u0302 = \u2206k wk (n) annihilates zn , and the corresponding sequence transformation (7.22) is given by the ratio\n(n)\n\nTk\n\nwk (n) sn , \u03c9n\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\n\u2206k {wk (n)sn /\u03c9n }\n.\n\u2206k {wk (n)/\u03c9n }\n\n(7.24)\n\nA number of sequence transformations can be obtained by specializing wk (n). For instance, wk (n) =\n(n + \u03b2)k\u22121 with \u03b2 > 0 yields Levin's sequence transformation [201]:\n(n)\n\nLk (\u03b2, sn , \u03c9n ) =\n\n=\n\n\u2206k {(n + \u03b2)k\u22121 sn /\u03c9n }\n\u2206k {(n + \u03b2)k\u22121 /\u03c9n }\nk\nX\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nk\nj\nj=0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\nX\nk\nj\n(\u22121)\nj\nj=0\n(\u22121)j\n\n75\n\n(\u03b2 + n + j)k\u22121 sn+j\n(\u03b2 + n + k)k\u22121 \u03c9n+j\n(\u03b2 + n + j)k\u22121 1\n(\u03b2 + n + k)k\u22121 \u03c9n+j\n\n.\n\n(7.25)\n\n\fWe follow the notation of [156]. The subscript k denotes the order of the transformation, and n denotes the\nstarting index (the initial element) of the input data. Observe that the k+1 sequence elements sn , . . . sn+k\n(n)\nand the k + 1 remainder estimates \u03c9n . . . \u03c9n+k are needed for the computation of the transformation Lk .\nThe shift parameter \u03b2 has to be positive in order to admit n = 0 in (7.25). In most practical applications,\nit is observed that any choice other than \u03b2 = 1 does not lead to a significant improvement of the rate of\nconvergence, and therefore the choice \u03b2 = 1 is standard [156].\n(n)\n\nThe notation Lk (\u03b2, sn , \u03c9n ) is in need of a certain further explanation. As explained above, n represents\nthe initial element of the sequence {sn }\u221e\nn=0 used in the evaluation of the transform. The specification of\n(n)\nsn as the second argument of Lk (\u03b2, sn , \u03c9n ) is therefore redundant as far as the index n is concerned,\n(n)\nbecause n already appears as an upper index in Lk . The arguments sn (and \u03c9n ) are to be interpreted\nas follows: they rather specify the initial element sn and the initial remainder estimate \u03c9n which have\n(n)\nto be used in the calculation of the right-hand side of (7.25). Of course, the evaluation of Lk (\u03b2, sn , \u03c9n )\nrequires the k + 1 sequence elements {sn , . . . , sn+k , sn+k } as input. The knowledge of the \"post-initial\"\nelements {sn+1 , . . . , sn+k } is implicitly assumed in writing the definition (7.25).\nAccording to Smith and Ford, who had investigated the performance of sequence transformations for\na wide range of test problems [202, 203], Levin's transformation is among the most powerful and most\nversatile sequence transformations that are currently known.\nWe can also assume that the unspecified weights wk (n) in (7.24) are Pochhammer symbols according to\nwk (n) = (n + \u03b2)k\u22121 = \u0393(n + \u03b2 + k \u2212 1)/\u0393(n + \u03b2) with \u03b2 > 0. This yields the delta transformation (see\nEq. (8.2-7) of [156]):\n(n)\n\nSk (\u03b2, sn , \u03c9n ) =\n\n=\n\n\u2206k {(n + \u03b2)k\u22121 sn /\u03c9n }\n\u2206k {(n + \u03b2)k\u22121 /\u03c9n }\nk\nX\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nk\nj\nj=0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\nX\nk\nj\n(\u22121)\nj\nj=0\n(\u22121)j\n\n(\u03b2 + n + j)k\u22121 sn+j\n(\u03b2 + n + k)k\u22121 \u03c9n+j\n.\n\n(7.26)\n\n(\u03b2 + n + j)k\u22121 1\n(\u03b2 + n + k)k\u22121 \u03c9n+j\n\nAs in the case of Levin's transformation, the most obvious choice for the shift parameter is \u03b2 = 1.\nThe numerator and denominator sums in (7.25) and (7.26) can be computed more effectively with the\nhelp of the three-term recursions [see Eq. (7.2-8) of [156]]:\n(n)\n\n(n+1)(\u03b2)\n\nLk+1 (\u03b2) = Lk\n\n\u2212\n\n(\u03b2 + n + k)(\u03b2 + n + k)k\u22121 (n)\nLk (\u03b2) ,\n(\u03b2 + n + k + 1)k\n\n(7.27)\n\n(\u03b2 + n + k)(\u03b2 + n + k \u2212 1) (n)\nS (\u03b2) .\n(\u03b2 + n + 2k)(\u03b2 + n + 2k \u2212 1) k\n\n(7.28)\n\nand (see Eq.

In this\nLet us assume that the terms ak in (6.1) are strictly alternating, i.e. akP\nn\nn+1\ncase, the first term (\u22121)\nbn+1 not included in the partial sum sn = k=0 (\u22121)k bk is the best simple\nestimate for the truncation error. This corresponds to the remainder estimate\n\u03c9n = (\u22121)n+1 bn+1 = \u2206sn ,\n\n(7.29)\n\nwhich was proposed by Smith and Ford [202]. The use of this remainder estimate in (7.25) and (7.26)\n\n76\n\n\fyields the following sequence transformations [Eqs.

In particular, there is overwhelming empirical evidence that dk and \u03b4k work very\nwell in the case of convergent or divergent alternating series for instance as they occur in special function theory [23, 156, 180, 201, 202, 203, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210] or in perturbation theory\n[186, 207, 208, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217]. Only for some special model problems could rigorous\nconvergence proofs be obtained (see [218] or Sections 13 and 14 of [156]). No general convergence proof\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nis known for delta transformation \u03b4k as well as their parent transformations Lk and Sk . In view of\nthe partially unsatisfactory situation concerning the availability of mathematical proof, we have carried\nout high-precision studies of the convergence of sequence transformations of the type (7.31), in part using\nmulti-precision arithmetic (see Sec. 7.2.2). In the absence of a rigorous proof, one of the concerns which\nmay be raised against the convergence of the transforms (7.31) is a plausible asymptotic nature of the\nsequence of transforms. In our numerical experiments, we found no indication of asymptotic behaviour.\nThe rate of convergence of the transforms remained constant, and we observed apparent convergence\nup to 430 decimal figures (see Sec. 7.2.2 below). In the absence of rigorous proof and the presence of\nconsiderable numerical evidence for the computational usefulness of sequence transformations of the type\n(7.31), we believe that experimental mathematics may give some hints at the theoretical soundness of\nthe concepts involved.\n\n7.1.6\n\nThe Combined Nonlinear\u2013Condensation Transformation (CNCT)\n\nP\u221e\nWe assume the series\nk=0 ak is slowly convergent and nonalternating, i.e. ak > 0 \u2200k. In order to\nmake the notation of involved subscripts more clear, we temporarily identify ak \u2261 a(k). Following Van\nWijngaarden [219], we transform the nonalternating input series\n\u221e\nX\n\na(k) ,\n\nk=0\n\na(k) \u2265 0 ,\n\n(7.32)\n\nP\u221e\nwhose partial sums are given by (7.7), into an alternating series j=0 (\u22121)j Aj . After the first step of the\ntransformation, the limit of the input series is recovered according to\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\na(k) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nj=0\n\n77\n\n(\u22121)j Aj .\n\n(7.33)\n\n\fThe quantities Aj are defined according to\nAj =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(j)\n\nbk ,\n\n(7.34)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere\n\n(j)\n\nbk = 2k a(2k (j + 1) \u2212 1) .\n\n(7.35)\n\nObviously, the terms Aj defined in Eq. (7.34) are all positive if the terms a(k)P\nof the original series are\n\u221e\nall positive. The Aj are referred to as the condensed series [23], and the series j=0 (\u22121)j Aj is referred\nto as the transformed alternating series, or alternatively as the Van Wijngaarden transformed series.\n\nThe construction of the condensed series reminds one of Cauchy's condensation\ntheorem (see e.g. p. 28\nP\u221e\na(k)\nwith\nterms that satisfy\nof Ref. [220] or p. 121 of Ref. [221]). Given a nonalternating series\nk=0\nP\u221e\n|a(k + 1)| < |a(k)|, Cauchy's condensation theorem states that k=0 a(k) converges if and only if the\nfirst condensed sum A0 defined according to Eq. (7.34) converges.\n\nThe summation over k in Eq. (7.34) dose not pose numerical problems. Specifically, it can be easily\nP\n(j)\nshown in many cases P\nof practical importance that the convergence of \u221e\n(in k) is linear even\nk=0 bk\n\u221e\nif the convergence of\na(k)\nis\nonly\nlogarithmic.\nWe\nwill\nillustrate\nthis\nstatement\nby way of two\nk=0\nexamples.\nExample 1: a logarithmically convergent input series whose terms behave asymptotically as a(k) \u223c k \u22121\u2212\u01eb\nwith \u01eb > 0. In this case, the partial sums\n(n)\n\nAj\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n(j)\n\nbk\n\n(7.36)\n\nk=0\n\nconverge linearly with\n(n+1)\n\nlim\n\nAj\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(n)\nAj\n\n\u2212 Aj\n\n\u2212 Aj\n\n=\n\n1\n< 1,\n2\u01eb (j + 1)1+\u01eb\n\na(k) \u223c k \u22121\u2212\u01eb ,\n\nk \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(7.37)\n\nExample 2: a series with a(k) \u223c k \u03b2 rk where 0 < r < 1 and \u03b2 real. Here, we have \u03c1 = r < 1, and the\nseries is (formally) linearly convergent. However, slow convergence may result if \u03c1 is close to one. In this\ncase, the condensed series are very rapidly convergent,\n(n+1)\n\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nAj\n\n(n)\nAj\n\n\u2212 Aj\n\n\u2212 Aj\n\na(k) \u223c k \u03b2 rk ,\n\n= 0,\n\nk \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(7.38)\n\nTherefore, when summing over k in evaluating the condensed series according to Eq. (7.34), it is in\nmany cases sufficient to evaluate the condensed series by adding the terms successively, and no further\nacceleration of the convergence is required.\nAs shown in [23, 222], the condensation transformation\nP\u221e defined according to Eqs (7.33)\u2013 (7.35) is essentially a reordering of the terms of the input series k=0 a(k). Furthermore, Daniel was able to show (see\nthe Corollary on p. 92 of Ref. [222]) that for nonalternating convergent series whose terms decrease in\nmagnitude (|a(k)| > |a(k + 1)|), the equality (7.33) holds. This formally justifies the correctness of the\ncondensation transformation defined according to Eqs. (7.33) \u2013 (7.35).\nNote that the property\n\n1\n[Aj\u22121 \u2212 aj\u22121 ] ,\n(j = 1, 2, . . . ) ,\n(7.39)\n2\nderived in [222], facilitates the numerical evaluation of a set of condensed series, by reducing the evaluation\nof condensed series of odd index to a trivial computation.\nA2 j\u22121 =\n\nIn\nstep of the CNCT, the convergence of the Van Wijngaarden transformed series\nP\u221ethe second\nj\n(\u22121)\nA\non\nthe right-hand side of Eq.

(7.40) as input data for the delta transformation (7.31). This\nleads to the CNC transforms\nTCNC (n) = \u03b4n(0) (1, S0 ) .\n(7.41)\nwhich require as input the elements {S0 , . . . , Sn , Sn+1 } of the Van Wijngaarden transformed series.\n\n7.2\n7.2.1\n\nApplications of Convergence Acceleration Methods\nApplications in Statistics and Applied Biophysics\n\nSeveral slowly convergent series of the type considered in this Section of the Thesis define special functions\nthat have important uses in statistics, namely the Riemann zeta, generalized zeta, Jonqui\u00e8re functions and\nLerch's transcendent (see [92] for definitions and some properties of these functions). Discrete distributions\nare related to these functions by associating probability mass functions (p.m.f.s) with the terms of the\nparticular infinite series defining the special functions. In turn, the normalization constants of the p.m.f.s\nare associated with the sums of the series.\nConsider a discrete distribution with the p.m.f.\nPr[X = n] = c p(n; \u03b8)\n\n(7.42)\n\nand with support of all nonnegative integers n = 0, 1, . . . , where \u03b8 is a (vector of) parameter(s) and c is\na constant. The probability over the set of all outcomes is unity:\n\u221e\nX\n\nPr[X = n] = 1 ,\n\n(7.43)\n\nn=0\n\nfrom which we obtain the normalization constant\nc\u22121 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\np(n; \u03b8)\n\n(7.44)\n\nn=0\n\n(in statistics, the random variable is usually denoted by the symbol n, whether continuous or discrete,\nbut we will denote it here by the symbol n in order to follow the usual notation used in the treatment of\nspecial functions). Thus we expect the sum in Eq. (7.44) to exist and to converge to a finite value. In the\nsequel, we consider several related discrete distributions. The Zipf distribution has the p.m.f.\npx = c\n\n1\nns\n\n(7.45)\n\nwith support of all positive integers n = 1, 2, . . . . The normalization constant (7.44) is then\nc\u22121 = \u03b6(s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n1\n,\nns\nn=1\n\n(7.46)\n\nwhere s > 1, which is immediately recognized as the Dirichlet series for the Riemann zeta function [Eq. (1)\non p. 32 of Ref. [92]]. Basic properties of the Zipf distribution can be found in [223].\nThe Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution [224] is the generalization of the Zipf distribution that adds a constant\nto the ranks n and has the p.m.f.\n1\n(7.47)\npx = c\n(n + v)s\nwith the support of all nonnegative integers n = 0, 1, . . . . The normalization constant (7.44) is then\nc\u22121 = \u03b6(s, v) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n,\n(n + v)s\nn=0\n\n79\n\n(7.48)\n\n\fwhere v 6= 0, \u22121, . . . . The sum (7.48) is recognized as the generalized zeta function [Eq. (1) on p. 24 of\nRef. [92]].\nFurther, the p.m.f.\n\nzn\n(7.49)\nns\nwith the support of all positive integers n = 1, 2, . . . defines the Good distribution [225]. The constant (7.44) is then\n\u221e\nX\nzn\n,\n(7.50)\nc\u22121 = F (z, s) =\nns\nn=1\npx = c\n\nwhere |z| < 1, which is recognized as the Jonqui\u00e8re's function [Eq. (14) on p. 30 of Ref. [92]; see also [226]].\nImportant properties of the Good distribution were derived in [227, 228].\n\nIn biophysics, one is interested in establishing the statistical structure of DNA and RNA sequences.\nIndeed, an interest in statistical compositions of DNA and protein sequences originated shortly after\nthe discovery that the nucleotide sequences of RNA uniquely determines the amino-acid sequence of the\nproteins. An early analysis was performed in [229], where it was observed that the distributions of relative\nabundances of amino-acids and nucleotides were nonrandom, i.e. deviated from models assuming uniform\ndistribution of different words in any given text. Zipf distributions and related generalizations proved to\nbe very useful in further studies [230, 231, 232].\nA formal generalization of the Zipf, the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot and the Good distributions is possible upon\nrealizing that the Riemann zeta, the generalized zeta and the Jonqui\u00e8re functions constitute special cases\nof the Lerch transcendent which is defined by the following series\n\u03a6(z, s, v) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nzn\n,\n(n + v)s\nn=0\n\n(7.51)\n\nwhere |z| < 1 and v 6= 0, \u22121, . . . [Eq. (1) on p. 27 of Ref. [92]]. We use here the the nonstandard notation\nof a dummy index n in order to highlight the connection with statistical theory. The relations between\n\u03a6(z, s, v) and \u03b6(s), \u03b6(s, v) and F (z, s) can be obtained by considering appropriate limits if \u03a6(z, s, v) (e.g.,\nby letting z and/or v to 0 and/or 1), and by making use of the following functional relation [Eq. (2) on\np. 27 of Ref. [92]]\nm\u22121\nX\nzn\n.\n(7.52)\n\u03a6(z, s, v) = z m \u03a6(z, s, m + v) +\n(n + v)s\nn=0\n\nIn particular, Eq. (7.52) with m = 1 can be used to evaluate sums that start from n = 1 rather than\nfrom n = 0:\n\u221e\nX\nzn\n= z \u03a6(z, s, 1 + v)\n(7.53)\n(n + v)s\nn=1\n\nIn Tab. 7.1, we have summarized the relations between the different statistical distributions and their\ndefining special functions. The table illustrates the fact that the three distributions, Zipf (Zeta), Zipf\u2013\nMandelbrot (Generalized zeta) and Good (Jonqui\u00e8re), are special cases of the Lerch distribution, and\nthat their properties can be expressed in terms of Lerch's transcendent with special values of parameters.\nWe have found that the application of the combined nonlinear-condensation transformation (CNCT)\ndescribed in detail in Sec. 7.1.6 is very suitable for the accelerated evaluation of the Lerch transcendent\n(7.51) in the nonalternating case (z > 0). Details of the implementation, both in C and Mathematica [90],\nare discussed in [30, 31]. For z < 0, the series (7.51) is alternating. In this case, the direct application\nof the delta transformation (7.31) leads to an efficient calculational scheme [31]. A C code for the Lerch\ntranscendent is available [233, 234].\n\n7.2.2\n\nAn Application in Experimental Mathematics\n\nWe would like to begin this section by quoting [235]: \"In April 1993, Enrico Au\u2013Yeung, an undergraduate\nat the University of Waterloo, brought to the attention of the author's [David Bailey's] colleague Jonathan\n\n80\n\n\fDistribution\n\nSupport\n\np.m.f.\n\nc\u22121\n\n1, 2, . . .\n\nc n\u2212s\n\n\u03b6(s) = \u03a6(1, s, 1)\n\n0, 1, . . .\n\nc (n + v)\u2212s\n\n\u03b6(s, v) = \u03a6(1, s, v)\n\n1, 2, . . .\n\nc z n n\u2212s\n\nF (z, s) = z \u03a6(z, s, 1)\n\n0, 1, . . .\n\nc z n (n + v)\u2212s\n\n\u03a6(z, s, v)\n\n(related function)\n\nZipf\n(zeta function)\nZipf\u2013Mandelbrot\n(generalized zeta)\nGood\n(Jonqui\u00e8re function)\nLerch\n(Lerch's transcendent)\n\nTable 7.1: Interrelationships between distributions defined by Riemann zeta, generalized\nzeta, Jonqui\u00e8re and Lerch functions.\n\nBorwein the curious fact that\n\u00132\n\u221e \u0012\nX\n17\n1\n17\u03c0 2\n1\nk \u22122 = 4.59987 * * * \u2248\n\u03b6(4) =\n,\n1 + + ***+\n2\nk\n4\n360\n\n(7.54)\n\nk=1\n\nbased on a computation of 500,000 terms. Borwein's reaction was to compute the value of this constant\nto a higher level of precision in order to dispel this conjecture. Surprisingly, his computation to 30 digits\naffirmed it.

In order to calculate (7.59) to an accuracy of 200 decimals, Eq. (7.67) says that\nwe would be required to add on the order of 10205 terms. Without the use of convergence acceleration\nmethods, this would represent a formidable computational task.\n\n82\n\n\fUsing the CNCT, it is easy to calculate the sum (7.59) to 200 digits, based on multiprecision arithmetic [235] and a Linux personal computer, within a few hours. We obtain for the 246th and the 247th\nCNC transform defined according to Eq.

(7.59). Of\ncourse, the right-hand side of Eq. (7.59), which involves only rationals, zeta functions and the Euler\u2013\nMascheroni constant,\n17\n\u03b6(4) \u2212 4C \u03b6(3) + C 2 \u03b6(2) ,\n4\ncan be easily evaluated to 200 decimals using known algorithms which are included in computer algebra\nsystems [90].\nThe evaluation of the terms \u0101(k) proceeds as follows. For small index k, it is easy to write a recursion\nrelation relating \u0101(k) and \u0101(k + 1) based on the (trivial) recursion for the \u03c8 function,\n\u03c8(k + 1) = \u03c8(k) +\n\n1\n.\nk\n\n(7.70)\n\nFor large index k, the asymptotic formula (7.65) can be used in order to calculate the \u03c8 function to high\nprecision. The point at which index one may switch from the recursion to the asymptotic method depends\non how many explicit values for Bernoulli numbers are available to the machine. We use the first values\nfor the first 60 Bernoulli numbers, to 250 decimals, for our calculation. We switch from one method to\nthe other when the index k of \u0101(k) has reached a value of 500.\nWith 84 308 \u0101(k) terms evaluated (out of which 1364 by recursion and 82944 by the asymptotic method),\nwe evaluate the first 247 transforms with the results presented above in Eqs. (7.68) and (7.69). If the\nterms of the series (7.54) were added on a term-by-term basis, then about 10205 would be required for an\naccuracy of 200 decimals in the final result. The reduction of this number to roughly 84 000 corresponds\nto an acceleration of the convergence by roughly 200 orders of magnitude. We have also carried out,\nusing enhanced precision, a calculation to 430 decimals, involving about 500 CNC transformations and\narithmetic with 600 decimal figures. These evaluations not only confirm the conjecture (7.59) to high\nprecision, but they also represent one of the most accurate experimental verifications of the convergence\nproperties of the delta transformation (7.31) today. Moreover, it is observed that the rate of convergence\nof the CNC transforms, which is approximately one decimal figure per transformation, remains constant\nover a wide range of transformation orders. This observed behaviour is consistent with linear convergence\n[\u03c1 \u2248 0.1 in Eq. (7.6)] in higher transformation orders. By contrast, the series (7.59) is only logarithmically\nconvergent. This corresponds to convergence acceleration according to the definition (7.9).\n\n83\n\n\f7.2.3\n\nOther Applications of the CNCT\n\nWe would like to mention the existing applications in the domain of quantum electrodynamic bound-state\ncalculations (see [9, 12, 43] and Ch. 1 of this Thesis). Another existing application concerns the quantum\nelectrodynamic effective action (see Ref. [20]).\nJ. Becher [239] has investigated the applicability of the combined nonlinear-condensation transformation\nto series of the form\n\u221e\nX\nx2k+1\nRp (x) =\n,\n(7.71)\n(2k + 1)p\nk=0\n\nas well as\n\nTp (x, b) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\nand\nUp (x, b) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\n1\ncosh(2k + 1)x\n,\n(2k + 1)p cosh(2k + 1)b\n\n(7.72)\n\ncosh(2k + 1)x\n1\n.\np\n(2k + 1) sinh(2k + 1)b\n\n(7.73)\n\nSeries of this type occur naturally in the context of plate contact problems with periodic boundary\nconditions [240]. The arguments p, x and b are real and positive for cases of practical relevance. For x \u2248 b\nand p \u2248 1, the series Tp and Up are very slowly convergent. In App. A.2 of [239], it is demonstrated by\nway of numerical example that the CNCT is able to efficiently accelerate the convergence of these series\nin problematic parameter regions.\nIn the numerical calculations, it is necessary to evaluate terms with large index k. This can lead to\nnumerical overflow because of the large arguments of the hyperbolic functions. Clearly, representations\nlike\n\u221e\nX\ne(2k+1)(x\u2212b) 1 + e\u22122x(2k+1)\n(7.74)\nTp (x, b) =\n(2k + 1)p 1 + e\u22122b(2k+1)\nk=0\nprovide a solution for this problem.\n\nLet us recall that considerable effort has been invested in the development of efficient numerical methods\nfor the evaluation of the series (7.71) \u2013 (7.73) [241, 242, 243, 244, 245]. These alternative methods make\nintensive use of special properties of the series. They involve integral transformations and infinite series\nover numerical integral [244], and they make use of special properties of Legendre's chi-function [243]\nwhich is related to the functions (7.71) \u2013 (7.73).\nA further application of convergence acceleration methods discussed by J. Becher [239] is the calculation\nof the incomplete Gamma function \u0393(0, x) whose asymptotic expansion for large argument reads\n\u0393(0, x) \u223c\n\n\u221e\ne\u2212x X\nn!\n(\u22121)n n ,\nx n=0\nx\n\nx \u2192 \u221e. .\n\n(7.75)\n\nIt is observed (see App. A.3 ibid.) that the divergent asymptotic series of this function for large positive\nargument can be resummed effectively using the delta transformation, without any recourse to the CNCT.\n\n7.3\n\nConclusions and Outlook for Convergence Acceleration\n\nWe have discussed several applications of the convergence acceleration methods introduced in Sec. 7.1: in\nstatistical physics (Sec. 7.2.1), in experimental mathematics (Sec. 7.2.2), and other applications, mainly\nin the evaluation of special functions (Sec. 7.2.3). Specifically, it is observed that a combination of the\nmethods introduced in Secs. 7.1.5 and 7.1.6 leads to an efficient calculational scheme for the Lerch\ntranscendent \u03a6 defined in Eq. (7.51). This special function provides a generalization of several kinds of\nprobability density functions which are of significance for the statistical analysis of DNA sequences (see\nTable 7.1).\nOther applications can be envisaged: For example, the evaluation of generalized hypergeometric functions\n\u2013 notably of two-variable hypergeometric functions (Appell functions) F1 and F2 [246] \u2013 has been historically problematic. In the recent investigation [247], the evaluation of F1 (\u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b3; x, y) is considered:\n84\n\n\fThe algorithm consists in two steps: (i) the sophisticated use of analytic continuations to map the point\n(x, y) into the convergence region of the defining hypergeometric series of the Appell function, and (ii)\nthe computation of the Appell function within the region of convergence. The analytic continuations give\nrise \u2013 in addition to F1 functions of transformed argument \u2013 to the G2 function, which can in turn be\nwritten in terms of Appell's F2 function. This implies that numerical methods also have to be devised for\nthe F2 function. The second step of the algorithm described in [247] is the actual numerical calculation of\nthe Appell function(s) (F1 and F2 ) within the region of convergence. This calculation proceeds by investigating the criterion t0 = max(|x|, |y|) < 0.5. If the criterion is fulfilled, then both the F1 and the F2 are\nevaluated by single-index series expansions in terms of 2 F1 's, for example employing the formula [248, 249]\nF1 (\u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b3; x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u03b1)r (\u03b21 )r (\u03b22 )r (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1)r\nr=0\n\n\u00d7\n\n2 F1 (\u03b1\n\n(\u03b3 + r \u2212 1)r (\u03b3)2r r!\n\n+ r, \u03b21 + r, \u03b3 + 2r, x) 2 F1 (\u03b1 + r, \u03b22 + r, \u03b3 + 2r, y) .\n\n(7.76)\n\nIf the criterion is not fulfilled, the authors resort to the solution of a third-order differential equation\nfor the evaluation of the Appell function [starting from the point (x, y) = (0, 0) where F1 vanishes]. It\nappears possible that an application of convergence acceleration algorithms to the series (7.76) could lead\nto an efficient calculational scheme in the problematic case t0 > 0.5 where the authors of [247] had to\nresort to an integration of a third-order differential equation.\nPossible improvements over existing algorithms concern \"multi-stage transformations\". For example, it\nwas observed in [26] that the rate of convergence of the output data resulting from Borel summation\n(see Sec. 8.2.2) of a specific divergent series describing the quantum electrodynamic effective action could\nbe further accelerated by using two iterations of the epsilon algorithm [defined in Eq. 7.14)], i.e. by\nevaluating Pad\u00e9 approximants to the Pad\u00e9 approximants of the Borel transforms (in this sequence).\nIterated forms of a number of convergence accelerators have been discussed in [156]. In general, the\niteration of suitable convergence accelerators depends on a thorough analysis of the remainder structure\nresulting from previous \"stages\" of the transformation, and it is not a priori guaranteed that a \"multi-stage\ntransformation\" with only one iterated algorithm will help. In principle, the use of iterated algorithms can\nonly be helpful when the evaluation of the sequence transforms or Pad\u00e9 approximants is computationally\ncheap in comparison to the evaluation of further terms of the input sequence which could potentially be\nused to calculate higher-order terms in a single-stage transformation process.\n\n85\n\n\fChapter 8\n\nDivergent Series\n8.1\n\nIntroduction to Divergent Series in Physics\n\nThe observation that many perturbation series encountered in quantum mechanics and quantum field\ntheory are divergent, sparked the development of large-order perturbation theory [250]. This subject is\ninherently connected to the resummation of divergent series, and with the development of appropriate\nnumerical methods which exploit all available information contained in a necessarily finite number of\nperturbative coefficients. Of prime importance in this context is the Borel method to be discussed in\nSec. 8.2.2.\nAs already stressed in Ch. 8, there are connections between the convergence acceleration methods discussed in Ch. 7 and the resummation methods discussed in the current Chapter. Specifically, the methods\nintroduced in Secs. 7.1.4 and 7.1.5 will be used below in Sec. 8.3.2 in the context of the resummation of\nthe divergent perturbation series for the QED effective action.\nEssentially, we will consider four physical applications of resummation methods: (i) the energy displacement of a hydrogen atom in a background electric field, including the autoionization width (Sec. 8.2),\n(ii) zero-dimensional field theories (Sec. 8.3.1), (iii) the QED effective Lagrangian for background magnetic and electric fields (Sec. 8.3.2), and (iv) the energy levels of the double-well potential which receive\nnonperturbative contributions from multi-instanton effects (Sec. 8.3.3).\nSeveral important aspects and basic concepts connected with divergent series and the large-order behavior\nof perturbation theory can be illustrated by investigating the (divergent) perturbation series of the Stark\neffect [251]. This effect, which is also known as the LoSurdo\u2013Stark effect in view of the existence of the\ninvestigation [252]), describes the energy displacement of a hydrogen atom in a static external electric\nfield and can be expressed as a perturbation series (power series) in the electric field strength.\nThe first nonvanishing perturbation (in atomic units) is the second-order effect\nF2\n\nX h\u03c61S |z|\u03c6m i h\u03c6m |z|\u03c61S i\n,\nE1S \u2212 Em\n\nm6=1S\n\nwhere the sum over m runs over the entire spectrum, including the continuum, but excluding the 1S ground\nstate, and Em is the nonrelativistic (Schr\u00f6dinger) energy of the mth state. A well known, but perhaps\nsurprising result says that the coefficients of the terms of order F 4 , F 6 , F 8 , . . . grow so rapidly that the\nseries in F ultimately diverges, irrespective of how small the field strength is. The convergence radius of\nthe factorially divergent perturbation series is zero. The perturbation series for the Stark effect [251, 252]\ncan be formulated to arbitrarily high order [253]. The perturbative coefficients grow factorially in absolute\nmagnitude [254]. The perturbation series is a divergent, asymptotic expansion in the electric field strength\nF , i.e. about zero electric field. This means that the perturbative terms at small coupling first decrease in\nabsolute magnitude up to some minimal term. After passing through the minimal term, the perturbative\nterms increase again in magnitude, and the series ultimately diverges.\nBy the use of a resummation method, it is possible to assign a finite value to an otherwise divergent\nseries, and various applications of resummation methods in mathematics and physics have been given,\n86\n\n\fe.g., in [24, 156, 165, 179, 255]. When a divergent series is resummed (cf. Ch. 6), the superficial precision\nlimit set by the minimal term can be overcome, and more accurate results can be obtained as compared\nto the optimal truncation of the perturbation series. However, the resummation of the relevant divergent\nseries is problematic in the considered case, because the Borel transform, from which the physically\ncorrect, finite result is obtained by evaluating a generalized Borel integral \u2013 see Eq. (8.11) in Sec. 8.2.2\nbelow \u2013, exhibits a rich singularity structure in the complex plane. The perturbation series is formally\nnot Borel summable.\nThe Stark effect and its associated divergent perturbative expansion including the nonperturbative, nonanalytic imaginary contributions have attracted considerable attention, both theoretically and experimentally [157, 253, 254, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272,\n273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286]. Experiments have been performed in\nfield strengths up to a couple of MV/cm [287, 288, 289, 290].\nRather mathematically motivated investigations regarding the Borel summability of the divergent perturbation series for the Stark effect were performed in [265] and [159], and it was established that the\nperturbation series of the Stark effect is Borel summable in the distributional sense (for the definition of\n\"distributional Borel summability\" we refer to [158]).\nIn comparison to the previous investigation [157], we use here an optimized resummation method that\ncombines an analytic continuation of the Borel transform with Pad\u00e9 approximants in the conformal\nvariable and the explicit use of the \"leading renormalon pole\". All of these methods will be described\nin Secs. 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. These optimized Borel transforms represent an alternative to so-called orderdependent mappings which have been discussed intensively in the literature [291, 292, 293, 294].\nAfter the discussion of the Stark effect (Secs. 8.2.2 \u2013 8.2.4), we turn our attention to the resummation\nof the divergent perturbation series for zero-dimensional field theories (Sec. 8.3.1), to the QED effective\naction (Sec. 8.3.2), and to the double-well potential (Sec. 8.3.3).\n\n8.2\n8.2.1\n\nThe Stark Effect: A Paradigmatic Example\nPerturbation Series for the Stark Effect\n\nIn the presence of an electric field, the SO(4) symmetry of the hydrogen atom is broken, and parabolic\nquantum numbers n1 , n2 and m are used for the classification of the atomic states [168]. For the Stark\neffect, the perturbative expansion of the energy eigenvalue E(n1 , n2 , m, F ) reads [see Eq.

For states with n1 = n2 , the odd-N perturbative\ncoefficients vanish [269], and the even-N coefficients necessarily have the same sign in large order [see\nEq. (8.2)]. According to Eq. (8.2), there are subleading divergent nonalternating contributions for states\nwith n1 > n2 , and there exist subleading divergent alternating contributions for states with n1 < n2 .\nThis complicates the resummation of the perturbation series.\n\nIm(t)\n\n6\n\narg t =\n\n\u0019\n4\n\nPoles displa ed from the real axis\n\n\u0002\n-\n\n-\n\n\u0002\n\n6\n\n\u0002\n\n-?\n\u0002\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\n6\n\n-N\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\n-\n\n\u0002\n\n6\n\n-\n\nRe(t)\n\n-\n\nPoles lying on the real axis\n\nFigure 8.1: Integration contour C+1 for the evaluation of the generalized Borel integral\ndefined in Eq.

First we define the parameter\n\u03bb = 2 max(n1 , n2 ) + m + 1 .\n\n88\n\n(8.8)\n\n\fThe large-order growth of the perturbative coefficients [see Eqs. (8.2) and (8.3)] suggests the definition\nof the (generalized) Borel transform [see Eq. (4) in [26]]\nEB (z) \u2261\n=\n\n=\n\nEB (n1 , n2 , m, z)\nB (1,\u03bb) [E(n1 , n2 , m); z]\n\u221e\n(N )\nX\nEn1 n2 m N\nz ,\n\u0393(N + \u03bb)\n\n(8.9)\n\nN =0\n\nwhere we consider the argument z of EB (z) as a complex variable and \u03bb is defined in Eq. (8.8). The\nadditive constant (in this case \u03bb) in the argument of the Gamma function is chosen in accordance with\nthe notion of an \"asymptotically improved\" resummation (see also [26]). It is observed that the additive\nconstant \u03bb can be shifted by a small integer without affecting the convergence of the Borel resummed\n(N )\nseries. Because the perturbative coefficients En1 n2 m diverge factorially in absolute magnitude, the Borel\ntransform EB (z) has a finite radius of convergence about the origin. The evaluation of the (generalized)\nLaplace\u2013Borel integral [see Eq. (8.11) below] therefore requires an analytic continuation of EB (z) beyond\nthe radius of convergence. The \"classical\" Borel integral is performed in the z-range z \u2208 (0, \u221e), i.e. along\nthe positive real axis [see e.g. Eqs. (8.2.3) and (8.2.4) of [165]]. It has been suggested in [295] that the\nanalytic continuation of (8.9) into regions where F retains a nonvanishing, albeit infinitesimal, imaginary\npart can be achieved by evaluating Pad\u00e9 approximants. Using the first M +1 terms in the power expansion\nof the Borel transform EB (z), we construct the Pad\u00e9 approximant [we follow the notation of [179], see\nalso Eq. (7.12)]\n\u0014\n\u001e\n\u0015\nPM (z) = [[M/2]]\n\n[[(M + 1)/2]]\n\n(z) ,\n\n(8.10)\n\nEB\n\nwhere [[x]] denotes the largest positive integer smaller than x. We then evaluate the (modified) Borel\nintegral along the integration contour C+1 shown in Fig. 8.1 in order to construct the transform TEM (F )\nwhere\nZ\ndt t\u03bb\u22121 exp(\u2212t) PM (F t) .\n(8.11)\nTEM (F ) =\nC+1\n\nThe successive evaluation of transforms TEM (F ) in increasing transformation order M is performed, and\nthe apparent convergence of the transforms is examined. This procedure is illustrated in Tables I and II\nof [25].\nThe contour C+1 is supposed to encircle all poles at t = zi in the upper right quadrant of the complex\nplane with arg zi < \u03c0/4 in the mathematically negative sense. That is to say, the contribution of all poles\nzi with Re zi > 0, Im zi > 0 and Re zi > Im zi ,\nX\nRes t\u03bb\u22121 exp(\u2212t) PM (F t) ,\n\u22122 \u03c0 i\ni\n\nt=zi\n\nis added to the principal value (P.V.) of the integral (8.11) carried out in the range t \u2208 (0, \u221e). We have,\nZ \u221e\nTEM (F ) = (P.V.)\ndt t\u03bb\u22121 exp(\u2212t) PM (F t)\n0\n\n\u22122 \u03c0 i\n\nX\ni\n\nRes t\u03bb\u22121 exp(\u2212t) PM (F t) .\n\nt=zi\n\n(8.12)\n\nThe principal-value prescription [first term in Eq. (8.12)] for the evaluation of the Laplace\u2013Borel integral\nhas been recommended in [295, 296]. This prescription leads to a real (rather than complex) result\nfor the energy shift and cannot account for the width of the quasistationary state. The additional pole\ncontributions [second term in Eq. (8.12)] are responsible for complex-valued (imaginary) corrections which\nlead, in particular, to the decay width.\n\n89\n\n\fBy contour integration (Cauchy Theorem) and Jordan's Lemma, one can show that the result obtained\nalong C+1 is equivalent to an integration along the straight line with arg z = \u03c0/4,\nZ \u221e\n\u03bb\nTEM (F ) = c\ndt t\u03bb\u22121 exp(\u2212c t) PM (F c t)\n(8.13)\n0\n\nwhere c = exp(i \u03c0/4). This contour has been used in [157] (see also p. 815 in [297]). The exponential\nfactor exp(\u2212c t) and the asymptotic behavior of the Pad\u00e9 approximant PM (F c t) as t \u2192 \u221e together\nensure that the integrand falls off sufficiently rapidly so that the Cauchy Theorem and Jordan's Lemma\ncan be applied to show the equivalence of the representations (8.12) and (8.13).\nThe representation (8.13) illustrates the fact that the integration in the complex plane along C+1 analytically continues the resummed result in those cases where the evaluation of the standard Laplace\u2013Borel\nintegral is not feasible due to poles on the real axis. The representations (8.11) and (8.12) serve to clarify\nthe r\u00f4le of the additional terms which have to be added to the result obtained by the principal-value\nprescription in order to obtain the full physical result, including the nonperturbative, nonanalytic contributions. Note that, as stressed in [25], the pole contributions in general do not only modify the imaginary,\nbut also the real part of the resummed value for the perturbation series.\nFormally, the limit of the sequence of the TEM (F ) as M \u2192 \u221e, provided it exists, yields the nonperturbative result inferred from the perturbative expansion (8.1),\nlim TEM (F ) = E(F ) \u2261 E(n1 , n2 , m, F ) .\n\nM\u2192\u221e\n\n(8.14)\n\nBecause the contour C+1 shown in Fig. 8.1 extends into the complex plane, the transforms TEM (F )\nacquire an imaginary part even though the perturbative coefficients in Eq. (8.1) are real.\nIn the context of numerical analysis, the concept of incredulity [298] may be used for the analysis of the\nconvergence of the transforms TEM (F ) of increasing order M . If a certain number of subsequent transforms exhibit apparent numerical convergence within a specified relative accuracy, then the calculation\nof transforms is stopped, and the result of the last calculated transformation is taken as the numerical\nlimit of the series under investigation. It has been observed in [25, 295] that for a number of physically\nrelevant perturbation series, the apparent numerical convergence of the transforms (8.11), with increasing\ntransformation order, leads to the physically correct results.\nIt is observed that the rate of convergence of the transforms (8.11) can be enhanced if instead of the\nunmodified Pad\u00e9 approximants (8.10) leading \"renormalon\" poles are explicit used for the construction\nof modified approximants. For the ground state, this entails the following replacement in Eq. (8.11):\nPM (z) \u2192 P \u2032 M (z) ,\nwhere\n\n\u0014\n\u001e\n\u0015\n1\nM +4\nM \u22123\nP M (z) =\n[[\n]] [[\n]]\n(z) ,\n1 \u2212 z2\n2\n2\nE \u2032 (\u03b6)\n\u2032\n\n(8.15)\n\nB\n\nwhere EB\u2032 (\u03b6) = (1 \u2212 \u03b6 2 ) EB (\u03b6). For the excited state with quantum numbers n1 = 3, n2 = 0 and m = 1,\nwe replace\nPM (z) \u2192 P \u2032\u2032 M (z) ,\nwhere\n\n\u0014\n\u001e\n\u0015\nM +2\nM \u22121\n1\n[[\n]] [[\n]] (z) ,\nP M (z) =\n1\u2212z\n2\n2\nE \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(8.16)\n\nB\n\nwhere EB\u2032\u2032 (\u03b6) = (1 \u2212 \u03b6 2 ) EB (\u03b6). The resummation method by a combination of Borel and Pad\u00e9 techniques\n\u2013 current Section \u2013 will be referred to as \"method I\" in the sequel.\n\n8.2.3\n\nDoubly\u2013Cut Borel Plane\n(N )\n\nAccording to Eqs. (8.2) and (8.3), the perturbative coefficient En1 n2 m , for large N , can be written as\nthe sum of an alternating and of a nonalternating divergent series. In view of Eqs. (8.4) and (8.7), we\nconclude that the series defined in Eq. (8.9),\nEB (z) =\n\n\u221e\n(N )\nX\nEn1 n2 m N\nz ,\n\u0393(N + \u03bb)\n\nN =0\n\n90\n\n\fhas a radius of convergence\n\n2\n(8.17)\n3 n3\nabout the origin, where n is the principal quantum number [see Eq. (8.5)]. Therefore, the function\ns=\n\nEB (w) =\n\n\u221e\n(N )\nX\nEn1 n2 m sN N\nw ,\n\u0393(N + \u03bb)\n\n(8.18)\n\nN =0\n\nhas a unit radius of convergence about the origin. It is not a priori obvious if the points w = \u22121 and\nw = +1 represent isolated singularities or branch points. The asymptotic properties (8.2) and (8.3)\ntogether with Eq. (8.6) suggest that the points w = \u22121 and w = +1 do not constitute poles of finite\norder. We observe that the leading factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients in large perturbation\norder N is divided out in the Borel transform (8.18), which is a sum over N . The perturbative coefficient\n(N )\nEn1 n2 m can be written as an asymptotic series over k [see Eq. (8.3)]. We interchange the order of the\nsummations over N and k, we use Eq. (8.6) and take advantage of the identity\n\u221e\nX\nwN\n= Lik (w) .\nNk\n\n(8.19)\n\nN =0\n\nThe Borel transform EB (w) can then be written as a sum over terms of the form Tk (w) where for k \u2192 \u221e,\nn nj m\n\nTk (w) \u223c C(ni , nj , m) ak i\n\nLik (w) .\n\n(8.20)\n\nThe coefficient C(ni , nj , m) is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\nC(ni , nj , m) = \u2212 2\u03c0n3 nj ! (nj + m)!\nexp {3 (ni \u2212 nj )} 62 nj +m+1 .\n\n(8.21)\n\nThese considerations suggest that the points w = \u22121 and w = +1 represent essential singularities (in this\ncase, branch points) of the Borel transform EB (w) defined in Eq. (8.18). For the analytic continuation of\nEB (w) by conformal mapping, we write w as\nw=\n\n2y\n1 + y2\n\n(8.22)\n\n(this conformal mapping preserves the origin of the complex plane). Here, we refer to w as the Borel\nvariable, and we call y the conformal variable.

We define the\npartial sum of the Borel transform, re-expanded in terms of the conformal variable y, as\nM\nE \u2032 B (y)\n\n=\n\nM\nX\n\nCN y N .\n\n(8.24)\n\nN =0\nM\n\nWe then evaluate (lower-diagonal) Pad\u00e9 approximants to the function E \u2032 B (y),\n\u0014\n\u001e\n\u0015\nM\nE \u2032\u2032 B (y) = [[M/2]] [[(M + 1)/2]]\n(y) .\n\n(8.25)\n\nE \u2032M\nB\n\nWe define the following transforms,\n\u2032\u2032\n\nT EM (F ) = s\n\n\u03bb\n\nZ\n\nC+1\n\n\u0001\n\u0001 M\ndw w\u03bb\u22121 exp \u2212w E \u2032\u2032 B y(w) .\n91\n\n(8.26)\n\n\fAt increasing M , the limit as M \u2192 \u221e, provided it exists, is then again assumed to represent the complete,\nphysically relevant solution,\nE(F ) = lim T \u2032\u2032EM (F ) .\n(8.27)\nM\u2192\u221e\n\nWe do not consider the question of the existence of this limit here (for an outline of questions related to\nthese issues we refer to [300]; potential problems at excessively strong coupling are discussed in Sec. IIC\nof [301]).\nInverting Eq. (8.22) yields [see Eq. (8.26)]\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1+w\u2212 1\u2212w\n\u221a\n.\ny(w) = \u221a\n1+w+ 1\u2212w\n\n(8.28)\n\nThe conformal mapping given by Eqs. (8.22) and (8.28) maps the doubly cut w-plane with cuts running\nfrom w = 1 to w = \u221e and w = \u22121 to w = \u2212\u221e unto the unit circle in the complex y-plane (i.e., it is a\nsurjective mapping). The cuts themselves are mapped to the edge of the unit circle in the y-plane.\nIn comparison to the investigations [299] and [300], we use here a different conformal mapping defined in\nEqs. (8.22) and (8.28) which reflects the different singularity structure in the complex plane [cf. Eq. (27)\nin [299]]. We also mention the application of Pad\u00e9 approximants for the numerical improvement of the\nconformal mapping performed according to Eq. (8.25). In comparison to [27], where the additional Pad\u00e9\u2013\nimprovement in the conformal variable is also used, we perform here the analytic continuation by a\nmapping whose structure reflects the double cuts suggested by the asymptotic properties of the perturbative coefficients given in Eqs. (8.2), (8.3) and (8.6) [cf. Eq. (5) in [27]].\nThe method introduced in this Section will be referred to as \"method II\". One goal of the current\ninvestigation is to contrast and compare the two methods I and II. A comparison of different approaches\nto the resummation problem for series with both alternating and nonalternating divergent components\nappears useful, in part because the conformal mapping (without further Pad\u00e9 improvement) has been\nrecommended for the resummation of quantum chromodynamic perturbation series [299, 300].\n\n8.2.4\n\nNumerical Calculations for the Stark Effect\n\nIn this section, the numerical results based on the resummation methods introduced in Secs. 8.2.2 and 8.2.3\nare presented. Before we describe the calculation in detail, we should note that relativistic corrections\nto both the real and the imaginary part of the energy contribute at a relative order of (Z\u03b1)2 compared\nto the leading nonrelativistic effect which is treated here (and in the previous work on the subject, see\ne.g. [157, 269]). Therefore, the theoretical uncertainty due to relativistic effects can be estimated to be, at\nbest, 1 part in 104 (for an outline of the relativistic and quantum electrodynamic corrections in hydrogen\nsee [1, 2, 48, 49, 50, 51, 302]). Measurements in very high fields are difficult [287]. At the achievable\nfield strengths to date (less than 0.001 a.u. or about 5 MV/cm), the accuracy of the theoretical prediction\nexceeds the experimental precision, and relativistic effects do not need to be taken into account.\n(N )\n\nThe perturbative coefficients En1 n2 m defined in Eq. (8.1) for the energy shift can be inferred, to arbitrarily\nhigh order, from the Eqs. (9), (13\u201315), (28\u201333), (59\u201367) and (73) in [253]. The atomic unit system is used\nin the sequel, as is customary for this type of calculation [253, 259, 262, 264]. The unit of energy is\n\u03b12 me c2 = 27.211 eV where \u03b1 is the fine structure constant, and the unit of the electric field is the field\nstrength felt by an electron at a distance of one Bohr radius aBohr to a nucleus of elementary charge,\nwhich is 1/(4 \u03c0 \u01eb0 ) (e/a2Bohr ) = 5.142 \u00d7 103 MV/cm (here, \u01eb0 is the permittivity of the vacuum).\n\nWe consider the resummation of the divergent perturbative expansion (8.1) for two states of atomic\nhydrogen. These are the ground state (n1 = n2 = m = 0) and an excited state with parabolic quantum\nnumbers n1 = 3, n2 = 0, m = 1. We list here the first few perturbative coefficients for the states under\ninvestigation. For the ground state, we have (in atomic units),\n3 555 4 2 512 779 6 13 012 777 803 8\n1 9\nF \u2212\nF \u2212\nF + ...\nE000 (F ) = \u2212 \u2212 F 2 \u2212\n2 4\n64\n512\n16 384\n\n(8.29)\n\nThe perturbation series for the state n1 = 3, n2 = 0, m = 1 is alternating, but has a subleading\nnonalternating component [see Eq. (8.2)]. The first perturbative terms read\nE301 (F ) = \u2212\n\n45\n31875 2 54 140 625 3 715 751 953 125 4\n1\n+\nF\u2212\nF +\nF \u2212\nF + ...\n50\n2\n2\n4\n16\n92\n\n(8.30)\n\n\fNote that for F = 0, the unperturbed nonrelativistic energy is recovered, which is \u22121/(2 n2) in\natomic units. In contrast to the real perturbative coefficients, the energy pseudoeigenvalue (resonance)\nE(n1 , n2 , m, F ) has a real and an imaginary component,\nE(n1 , n2 , m, F ) = Re En1 n2 m (F ) \u2212\n\ni\n\u0393n n m (F ) ,\n2 1 2\n\n(8.31)\n\nwhere \u0393n1 n2 m (F ) is the autoionization width.\nUsing a computer algebra system [90], the first 50 nonvanishing perturbative coefficients are evaluated\nfor the ground state, and for the state with parabolic quantum numbers n1 = 3, n2 = 0, m = 1, we\nevaluate the first 70 nonvanishing perturbative coefficients. The apparent convergence of the transforms\ndefined in Eqs. (8.11) and (8.26) in higher order is examined. In the case of the Borel\u2013Pad\u00e9 transforms\ndefined in Eq. (8.11), use is made of the replacements in Eqs. (8.15) and (8.16) [\"leading renormalon poles\nare being put in by hand\"]. This procedure leads to the numerical results listed in Tables 8.1 and 8.2.\nThe numerical error of our results is estimated on the basis of the highest and lowest value of the four\nhighest-order transforms.\nAn important result of the comparison of the methods introduced in Secs. 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 is the following:\nBoth methods appear to accomplish a resummation of the perturbation series to the physically correct\nresult. Method I (Borel+Pad\u00e9 with leading renormalon poles, see Sec. 8.2.2) and method II (Borel+Pad\u00e9improved conformal mapping, see Sec. 8.2.3) appear to lead to results of comparable accuracy.\nTo date, a rigorous theory of the performance of the resummation methods for divergent series of the type\ndiscussed in this work (with alternating and nonalternating components) does not exist. The logarithmic\nsingularities introduced by the branch points of higher-order polylogarithms [see the index k in Eq. (8.19)]\nare difficult to approximate with the rational functions employed in the construction of Pad\u00e9 approximants. A solution to the problem of approximating the logarithmic singularities, based on finite number\nof perturbative coefficients, would probably lead to further optimizimation of the rate of convergence of\nthe transformed series. Within the current scheme of evaluation, the problematic logarithmic singularities\nmay be responsible, at least in part, for certain numerical instabilities at higher transformation order,\ne.g. in the result for T \u2032\u2032E70 (F = 2.1393 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) in Eq.

The generating functional in zero dimensions has been proposed as a paradigmatic example for the divergence of\nperturbation theory in higher order. It can be resummed easily to the nonperturbative result; in particular\nit is manifestly Borel summable, and no singularities are present on the positive real axis. Specifically,\nin Table 8.2.4, we consider the resummation of the series (8.35) by Pad\u00e9 approximants (Sec. 7.1.4) and\ndelta transformations (Sec. 7.1.5). The rapid rate of convergence due to the delta transformations in\ncomparison to the Pad\u00e9 approximants is obvious; this finding is consistent with the results of Ref. [24].\nComplications are introduced by degenerate minima. As a second example, we consider the modified\ngenerating functional [compare with Eq. (2.6) on p. 15 of [250] and with Eq.

Here, we present numerical\nevidence supporting the summability of the divergent expansion (8.39) based on a finite number of\nperturbative coefficients. The final integration is carried out along the contour C0 introduced in [25] [see\nalso Eq. (8.44) below]. The same contour has also been used for the resummation of divergent perturbation\nseries describing renormalization group (anomalous dimension) \u03b3 functions [27].

The partial sums in the second column are obtained\nfrom the asymptotic series (8.38).\n\nIn particular, the resummation of the divergent expansion (8.39) is accomplished as follows. We first\ndefine the Borel transform of the generating functional by [see Eq. (4) in [26] and the discussion after\n97\n\n\fEq.

We then evaluate the (modified) Borel\nintegral along the integration contour C0 introduced in [25]; specifically we define the transform TZM (g)\nZ\ndt exp(\u2212t) P \u2032 M (g t) .\n(8.44)\nTZM (g) =\nC0\n\nIn this case, poles above and below the real axis must be considered, and the final result involves no imaginary part. The particular case of g = 0.01 is considered. Values for the partial sums of the perturbation\nseries (8.39) and the transforms defined in Eq. (8.44) are shown in Tab. 8.4. The transforms exhibit apparent convergence to 6 decimal places in 20th order, whereas the partial sums of the perturbation series\ndiverge. Between the second and forth term of the perturbation series, (the forth term constitutes the\nminimal term), the partial sums provide approximations to the exact result. It might seem surprising that\nthe minimal term in the perturbative expansion is reached already in forth order, although the coupling\nassumes the small value g = 0.01. This behavior immediately follows from the large geometric factor in\nEq. (8.41) which leads to a \"resultative coupling strength parameter\" of gres = 0.32. \"Nonperturbative\neffects\" of the order of exp(\u22121/gres) provide a fundamental limit to the accuracy obtainable by optimal\ntruncation of the perturbation series; this is consistent with the numerical data in Table 8.4.\nWe have also investigated the resummation of the divergent series (8.39) via a combination of a conformal\nmapping and Pad\u00e9 approximants in the conformal variable. The situation is analogous to the Stark effect:\nResults are consistent than those presented in Table 8.4 obtained by the \"pure\" Borel\u2013Pad\u00e9 and in this\ncase slightly more accurate. The radius of convergence of the Borel transform ZB\u2032 (z) defined in Eq. (8.42)\nis s = 1/32 [cf. Eq. (8.17) for the Stark effect], and the appropriate conformal mapping in this case reads\nw=\n[cf. Eq. (8.22)]. The inverse reads\n\n4y\n(1 + y)2\n\n(8.45)\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 1\u2212w\n\u221a\ny(w) =\n1+ 1\u2212w\n\n[cf. Eq. (8.28)]. The conformal mapping (8.45) maps the complex w-plane with a cut along (1, \u221e) unto\nthe unit circle in the complex y-plane. While the zero-dimensional model example given in Eq. (8.37) does\nnot exhibit all problematic features of degenerate anharmonic double-well oscillators, certain analogies\ncan be established; these comprise in particular the need to evaluate the mean value of Borel transforms\nabove and below the real axis (see also [27]).\n\n8.3.2\n\nThe Effective Action as a Divergent Series\n\nMaxwell's equations receive corrections from virtual excitations of the charged quantum fields (notably\nelectrons and positrons). This leads to interesting effects [303, 304]: light-by-light scattering, photon\nsplitting, modification of the speed of light in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields, and \u2013 last,\nbut not least \u2013 pair production.\nWhen the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out (in this case, the \"heavy particles\" are the electrons\nand positrons), an effective theory results. The corrections can be described by an effective interaction, the\nso-called quantum electrodynamic (QED) effective Lagrangian. The dominant effect for electromagnetic\n98\n\n\ffields that vary slowly with respect to the Compton wavelength (frequencies \u03c9 \u226a 2 m c2 /~) is described\nby the one\u2013loop quantum electrodynamic effective (so-called \"Heisenberg\u2013Euler\") Lagrangian which is\nknown to all orders in the electromagnetic field [304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309].\nThe Heisenberg\u2013Euler Lagrangian \u2206L, which constitutes a quantum correction to the Maxwell Lagrangian, is usually expressed as a one-dimensional proper-time integral [see e.g. Eq. (3.43) in [304],\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e+i \u03b7\na2 \u2212 b 2\n1\nds \u2212(m2 \u2212i\u01eb) s\ne2\n.\n(8.46)\nab coth(eas) cot(ebs) \u2212\ne\n\u2212\n\u2206L = \u2212 2 lim +\n8\u03c0 \u01eb,\u03b7\u21920 i \u03b7\ns\n3\n(es)2\n\nTo clarify the notation, we introduce the well-known Lorentz invariants F and G which are given by\n\u0001\n\u0001\nF = 1/4 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = 1/2 B 2 \u2212 E 2 = 1/2 a2 \u2212 b2 ,\n(8.47)\nG\n\n= 1/4 F\u03bc\u03bd (\u2217F )\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212E * B =\n\n\u00b1ab ,\n\n(8.48)\n\nwhere E and B are the electric and magnetic field strengths, F\u03bc\u03bd is the field strength tensor, and\n(\u2217F )\u03bc\u03bd denotes the dual field strength tensor (\u2217F )\u03bc\u03bd = (1/2) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03c1\u03c3 . By a and b we denote the secular\ninvariants,\nqp\na =\nF 2 + G2 + F ,\nb =\n\nqp\nF 2 + G2 \u2212 F .\n\n(8.49)\n\nThese Lorentz invariants are referred to as secular invariants because they emerge naturally as eigenvalues\nof the field strength tensor; these eigenvalues are conserved under proper Lorentz transformations of the\nfield strength tensor. There are connections between the different representations [304]: If the relativistic invariant G is positive, then it is possible to transform to a Lorentz frame in which E and B are\nantiparallel. In the case G < 0, it is possible to choose a Lorentz frame in which E and B are parallel.\nIrrespective of the sign of G we have in the specified frame\na = |B| and b = |E| if and only if B is (anti-)parallel to E .\n\n(8.50)\n\nIn any case, because a and b are positive definite, we have\na b = |E * B| > 0\n\nfor any Lorentz frame and G =\n6 0,\n\n(8.51)\n\nwhich clarifies the sign ambiguity in (8.48). We give in (8.47) and (8.48) seemingly redundant definitions,\nbut it will soon become apparent that each of the alternative \"points of view\" has its applications. The\nMaxwell Lagrangian is given by\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(8.52)\nLcl = \u2212F = \u22121/4 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = 1/2 E 2 \u2212 B 2 = 1/2 b2 \u2212 a2 .\n\nAs it is obvious from Eq. (8.46), the correction \u2206L to the Maxwell Lagrangian is conveniently written in\nterms of the secular invariants a and b.\n\nIt was observed as early as 1956 [310] that the quantum correction (8.46), when expressed as a perturbation series in the usual QED perturbation theory parameter \u03b1 = e2 /(4\u03c0), constitutes a divergent\nseries. This divergent character of the QED perturbative expansion is supported by Lipatov's argument\nbased on a saddle-point expansion of the generating functional [311, 312, 313], and explicit estimates for\nthe large-order (factorially divergent) behaviour of the QED perturbative coefficients have been obtained\nin [314, 315]. Recently, the divergent character of the large-order behaviour of perturbative expansions\nin quantum field theory has found an exquisite confirmation in explicit 30-loop calculations of renormalization group \u03b3 functions in a six-dimensional \u03c63 theory, and in a Yukawa theory [316, 317].\nHere, we will study the divergent series generated by expanding the effective action (8.46) in powers of e2 .\nWe will distinguish the cases of a magnetic and an electric background fields. We start with a magnetic\nfield of strength B in which case the effective action reads\n\u001b\n\u0012\n\u001a\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nm2e\n1 s\ne2 B 2\nds\nexp \u2212\ncoth s \u2212 \u2212\ns\n(8.53)\nSB \u2261 \u2206L(E = 0, B) = \u2212\n8\u03c0 2 0 s2\ns 3\neB\n99\n\n\f[put a = B, b = 0 in Eq.

In [163, 255, 310], it was shown that the series (8.55) is Borel\nsummable. A further expansion of the perturbative coefficients cn for large n is carried out in [255] in\norder to perform the Borel summation; this analysis follows the asymptotic expansion in Eq. (8.58) above,\nand higher-order terms in the asymptotics of the coefficients for large n are also used. Here we consider\nthe resummation of the divergent series (8.55) with the help of rational approximants which use as input\ndata only a finite number of perturbation theory coefficients in numerical form. Specifically, we use Pad\u00e9\napproximants defined in Eq. (7.12) and discussed in Sec. 7.1.4 and the nonlinear sequence transformations\nd and \u03b4 defined in Eqs. (7.30) and (7.31), respectively. The nonlinear transformations were discussed in\nSec. 7.1.5.\nThe transformations are applied to the divergent perturbation series Eq. (8.55), the transforms are calculated with the help of the recurrence relations (7.27) and (7.28). The evaluations presented in Tables 8.5\nand 8.6 are carried out for values gB = 1/10, gB = 1 and gB = 10 of the expansion parameter gB defined\nin Eq. (8.54). The first column in the tables contains the index n, the second column contains the partial\nsums of the input series and in the last three columns are the results of the Pad\u00e9 Approximation, the\nd-transformation and the delta-transformation.\nThe data in the tables is presented to a numerical accuracy of 10\u22129 . The convergence of the transforms\nis indicated by underlining those decimal places which appear to have converged to the nonperturbative\nresult. The numerical data in the Tables 8.5 and 8.6 indicate that the most favourable numerical results are\nobtained with the Weniger delta-transformation. For the numerical calculations, exact rational arithmetics\nwas used [90]. Numerical experiments for gB larger than 1 (not shown) and data presented in [24] indicate\nthat the Weniger delta transformation appears to resum the divergent series (8.55) at least up to gB = 200,\nand to arbitrary precision. The other resummation prescriptions \u2013 Pad\u00e9, and the Levin d-transformation\n\u2013 fail in this domain of strong coupling.\nIn the case of a background electric field, Eq.

In our context, the imaginary part (8.62) describes the pair production in an electric\nbackground field. As is well known, the vacuum in very strong electric fields becomes unstable with\nregard to particle-antiparticle pair production (see also the elucidating discussion in [303]).\nSpontaneous pair production becomes considerable only in strong external electric fields.

(8.61).\n\n8.3.3\n\nThe Double\u2013Well Problem\n\nWe discuss in the current section specific results, recently obtained in [29], for the quantum-mechanical\ndouble-well problem and the related multi-instanton expansion. The energy levels of the double-well potential receive, beyond perturbation theory, contributions which are non-analytic in the coupling strength;\nthese are related to instanton effects. For example, the separation between the energies of odd- and\neven-parity states is given at leading order by the one-instanton contribution, which, in the path integral\nformalism, corresponds to a tunneling of the particle from one minimum of the potential to the other minimum. In order to determine the energies (of individual levels as well as the separations) more accurately,\nmulti-instanton configurations have also to be taken into account. The multi-instanton configurations\ndescribe a particle that tunnels between the minima more than once. For even instantons, the particle\nreturns to the minimum from which it started the motion.\nFor the double-well problem, the energy eigenvalues of the states at nonvanishing coupling g 6= 0 cannot\nin principle be obtained by analytic continuation from the unperturbed situation at vanishing coupling\ng = 0 because a potential with degenerate minima introduces a degeneracy in the spectrum: for any\none unperturbed state, two states emerge when the perturbation is switched on. These two states are\nseparated by an energy shift which is nonperturbative and nonanalytic in the coupling, i.e. vanishing\nto any order in perturbation theory. Therefore, the two states are described by the same perturbation\nseries and yet differ in their energy by instanton contributions. Specifically, we consider the case of the\ndouble-well potential with the hamiltonian\nH=\u2212\n\ng \u22022\n1\n+ V (q) ,\n2\n2 \u2202q\ng\n\nV (q) =\n\n1 2\nq (1 \u2212 q)2 .\n2\n\n(8.66)\n\n\u221a\nOf course, the alternative formulation H = \u2212\u2202 2 /\u2202q 2 + 12 q 2 (1 \u2212 gq)2 gives rise to the same energy\nlevels, but the form (8.66) illustrates that the coupling plays the formal r\u00f4le of ~.

The conjecture (8.67), whose validity has been proven\nin [176], has found a natural explanation in the framework of Ecalle's theory of resurgent functions [175,\n177, 318]. The functions D(E, g), A(E, g) constitute power series in both variables. The function D(E, g)\ndescribes the perturbative expansion; its evaluation is discussed in [171, 174].

When the energy is expressed in terms of the naive\nperturbation series in g, the function [D(E, g) \u2212 N \u2212 1/2] then vanishes in any order of perturbation\ntheory, i.e. in all orders in g. Here, N is the quantum number of the unperturbed state which is a\n\n104\n\n\fharmonic oscillator eigenstate.

Of course, for strong coupling,\nsignificant deviations from the leading asymptotics must be expected due to higher-order effects; these\nare indeed observed.

Using the 160th through the 200th perturbation coefficient as\ninput data for the Richardson algorithm, the coefficients of the leading, of the 1/K-subleading and of the\n1/K 2 suppressed corrections are found to be consistent with the analytic results given in equation (8.80)\nup to a relative numerical accuracy of 10\u221226 , 10\u221223 and 10\u221220 , respectively.

The accuracy to which the one-instanton contribution describes the energy\ndifference E0,\u2212 (0.001) \u2212 E0,+ (0.001) is limited by the three-instanton effect which for g = 0.001 is of\nthe order of 8 \u00d7 10\u2212212 . Note that the two-instanton effect (which for g = 0.001 is of the order of\n4 \u00d7 10\u2212142 ) does not limit the accuracy to which the one-instanton contribution describes the energy\ndifference because it has the same sign for opposite-parity states.\nWe have demonstrated that the behavior of the characteristic function \u2206(g) defined in equation (8.77)\nat small coupling is consistent with higher-order corrections to the one- and two-instanton contributions,\nspecifically with the instanton expansion of the energy levels governed by the equations (8.71) and (8.73),\nwith the assumption that the instanton contributions given by equation (8.73) should be Borel summed,\nwith the explicit results for the higher-order coefficients listed in (8.74) and the analytically derived\nasymptotics for the function \u2206(g) given in equation (8.78). The corrections of relative order 1/K m\nto the leading factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients \u2013 see equation (8.80) \u2013 are consistent\nwith the analytically evaluated g m ln(\u22122/g)\u2013corrections to the two-instanton effect and with the explicit\nvalues for the first 200 terms in the perturbation series (8.72). The nonperturbative energy difference\nE0,\u2212 (g) \u2212 E0,+ (g) at small coupling g is described, to high accuracy, by the one-instanton contribution\nonly.\n\n8.4\n\nDivergent Series: Some Conclusions\n\nA priori, it may seem rather unattractive to assume that the quantum electrodynamic perturbation series\nmay be divergent even after the regularization and the renormalization. However, as shown by explicit\n108\n\n\fnontrivial 30-loop calculations of renormalization group \u03b3 functions in a six-dimensional \u03c63 theory, and\nin a Yukawa theory (presented recently in [316, 317]), we believe that the ultimate divergence of the\nperturbative expansion can be regarded as a matter-of-fact, clearly demonstrated by explicit high-order\ncalculations. Therefore, it appears meaningful to explore the physical implications of this divergence.\nWe have discussed four physical applications of resummation methods for divergent series: (i) the energy\ndisplacement of a hydrogen atom in a background electric field (Sec. 8.2.4), (ii) zero-dimensional (model)\nfield theories (Sec. 8.3.1), (iii) the QED effective Lagrangian (Sec. 8.3.2), and (iv) the energy levels of the\ndouble-well potential (Sec. 8.3.3). The mathematical structure of these problems can be characterized as\nfollows, in the order of increasing complexity:\n\u2022 The QED effective Lagrangian for a background magnetic field, expressed as a perturbation series\nin \u03b1, is manifestly Borel summable [163, 255, 310], and the nonperturbative result can be inferred\nby a number of different resummation methods, as discussed in Sec. 8.3.2.\n\u2022 The QED effective Lagrangian for a background electric field, as well as the perturbation series for\na hydrogen atom in an electric field, is not Borel summable. The same applies to the perturbation\nseries for a zero-dimensional field theory with degenerate minima. However, these three problems\nadmit a treatment according to the concept of generalized (distributional) Borel summability [158].\nNumerical results (see [25, 28] and Secs. 8.2.4 and 8.3.2) confirm the distributional Borel summability, and the use of additional asymptotic information about the perturbative coefficients [\"leading\nrenormalon poles\", see Eqs. (8.15) and (8.16) in Sec. 8.2.2] accelerates the convergence of the Boreltransformed perturbation series.\n\u2022 The double-well potential represent a very problematic case: the full nonperturbative solution to\nthe eigenvalue problem cannot be obtained in principle from perturbation theory. The reason is the\nfollowing: the perturbation introduces an additional degeneracy in the spectrum: each unperturbed\nlevel splits into two energy levels when the perturbation is nonvanishing. Both of these levels are\ndescribed by one and the same naive perturbation series (see Sec. 8.3.3). The energy difference is\nnonperturbative and nonanalytic in the coupling strength, and finds an explanation in the theory\nof instantons.\nFor the Stark effect and the QED effective Lagrangian (electric field), the existence of nonperturbative\ncontributions is intimately linked with the failure of the Carleman criterion (see for example [163], Theorems XII.17 and XII.18 and the definition on p. 43 in [164], p. 410 in [165], Ch. 6 of this Thesis or the\nelucidating discussion in Ref. [166]). The Carleman criterion determines, roughly speaking, if nonanalytic\ncontributions exist for a given effect which is described by a specified perturbation series. In this sense, the\ndivergence of the perturbative expansion is physically important: for the QED effective action, it allows\nfor the existence of nonanalytic, nonperturbative contributions like the pair-production amplitude which\nis not contained in the real perturbation series (8.61) and cannot be obtained on the basis of perturbation\ntheory alone.\nAlso, we would like to illustrate here the utility of resummation methods in those cases where perturbation\ntheory breaks down at large coupling. As explained in Secs. 8.2.4, 8.3.1 and 8.3.2, even in situations where\nthe perturbation series diverges strongly, it can still be used to obtain meaningful physical results if it is\ncombined with a suitable resummation method. In a relatively weak field, it is possible to obtain more\naccurate numerical results by resummation than by optimal truncation of the perturbation series (see\nalso [25]). In a strong field, it is possible to obtain physically correct results by resummation even though\nthe perturbation series diverges strongly (see the discussion in Sec. 8.2.4 and the data in Tables 8.1, 8.2\nand 8.4). By resummation, the perturbation series which is inherently a weak-coupling expansion can be\ngiven a physical interpretation even in situations where the coupling is large. Returning to the analogy\nto quantum field theory, one might be tempted to suggest that physically complete results can in many\ncases be obtained after regularization, renormalization and resummation.\nCan the full nonperturbative result (for energy levels etc.) be inferred in all cases by a resummation of\nthe divergent perturbation series? The answer is, unfortunately, no. This is demonstrated in Sec. 8.3.3\nby way of example. In theories with degenerate minima (such as the double-well problem), corrections\nto energy levels are caused by so-called instanton contributions that follow naturally by an expansion\nof the path integral around nontrivial saddle points. The n-instanton contribution is characterized by a\n\u221a\nnonperturbative factor \u03be(g)n where [see Eq. (8.70)] \u03be(g) = exp[\u22121/(6g)]/ \u03c0g, and g is the coupling. The\n109\n\n\fexpansion of \u03be(g) in powers of g vanishes in all orders of g. The nonperturbative energy splitting between\neven- and odd-parity states is investigated by considering the function \u2206(g) defined in Eq. (8.77). This\nfunction would vanish if the generalized Borel sum of the perturbation series could reproduce energy\nlevels exactly. However, it does not vanish, as demonstrated by the data in Tab. 8.9 (the numerical data\ncan be interpreted naturally by considering so-called two-instanton effects). At the same time, in a zerodimensional theory with degenerate minima (considered in Sec. 8.3.1), resummation is successful despite\nthe existence of a nontrivial saddle point. The reason for the success of the resummation in this model\nproblem appears to lie in the fact that no degeneraces are introduced by the additional saddle point. The\nperturbation series determines the generating functional uniquely, which is not the case in the double-well\npotential where two distinct energy levels (of opposite parity) share the same perturbation series. This\nintriguing situation will warrant further investigation in the near future.\n\n110\n\n\fChapter 9\n\nConclusions\nWe proceed to the interpretation of the results obtained in this Thesis, which has a dual subject: \"quantum\nelectrodynamic bound-state calculations and large-order perturbation theory\".\nThe significance of quantum electrodynamics as one of the most appealing physical theories (a \"jewel\" of\ntheoretical physics according to Richard Feynman) does not require any further explanation. The esthetic\nappeal of bound-state quantum electrodynamics stems from the accuracy of the experimental verifications,\nthe significance of the theory for the determination of the fundamental constants, and the conceptual\ncomplexity of the calculations which derives from the apparent simplicity of the physical systems under\nstudy, when an accurate understanding is required in higher orders of perturbation theory. However,\nthe divergence of the perturbative expansion in large orders, which persists even after the regularization\nand renormalization, raises fundamental questions regarding the internal consistency of the theoretical\npredictions. The problems associated with the divergence of the perturbative expansion do not only\nplague quantum electrodynamics, but even occur in ordinary quantum mechanical perturbation theory.\nThis Thesis is divided into two Parts, which represent two attempts to advance our understanding of the\nhigher-order corrections as well as of the conceptual questions raised by the divergence of the perturbative\nexpansion.\nIn the first Part, we discussed aspects of certain quantum electrodynamic bound\u2013state calculations, which\nhave been carried out over the past years. Not all of these calculations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,\n14, 15, 16, 17, 18] could be described in full detail. Both the experimental accuracy as well as the accuracy\nof the theoretical calculations have improved dramatically in recent years [42]. On the theoretical side, the\ncalculations at low nuclear charge number may be based on either of two methods: the analytic approach\nthat is based on the Z\u03b1-expansion and the numerical approach in which all electron propagators are\nkept in exact relativistic form. Progress has been achieved due to advances in the analytic approach that\nprofit from an adequate formulation of the problem, and due to the development of numerical techniques\nwhich have led to the highly accurate numerical evaluation of QED corrections in the realm of low nuclear\ncharge number. This has led to the favourable situation where analytic and numerical calculations can\nbe checked against each other. In view of the complexity of the calculations and their importance for\nthe determination of the fundamental constants [86], the existence of independent cross-checks for the\ncalculations is highly desirable.\nNumerical calculations at low Z have been made possible by convergence acceleration methods described\nin the second Part of this Thesis (notably by the combined nonlinear-condensation transformation). These\ntechniques have led to the solution of the severe numerical difficulties associated with the singularity of\nthe propagators for equal radial arguments, and to a reduction in computing time by three orders of\nmagnitude. Results obtained for the one-photon self energy are several orders of magnitude more accurate\nthan previous calculations of the effect. They represent the first direct evaluations of the one-loop self\nenergy at the nuclear charge numbers Z = 1 and Z = 2, which are of crucial importance for precision\nspectroscopy (atomic hydrogen and hydrogenlike helium).\nThe analytic calculations of the one-loop self energy for higher excited states will be complemented in the\nnear future by numerical calculations based on the new techniques [95], leading to a cross-check of the\ntype mentioned above. Severe difficulties associated with the multitude of analytic terms due to the more\ncomplicated wavefunctions of the highly excited states and the associated angular momentum algebra\nhave been a problem for self energy calculations in this area.\n111\n\n\fThe calculations for the bound-state two-loop self energy report on the first evaluation of the highly\nproblematic nonlogarithmic higher-order two-loop binding correction B60 . Let us recall that analytic\nwork on the corresponding A60 correction for the less involved one-loop problem has extended over three\ndecades [32, 68, 69, 70, 71]. The development of analytic methods for the evaluation of B60 leads to\nan improved understanding of the scaling of the two-loop effect at low Z and will enable a detailed\ncomparison of analytic and possibly available numerical results for the two-loop effect in the future. At\nthe same time, these results lead to improved predictions for the hydrogen and helium fine structure.\nThe spin-dependence of quantum electrodynamic corrections is a conceptually important issue. We focus\non spinless particles and present a simplified derivation of the generalized Breit hamiltonian for a system\nof two spinless particles. Although scalar QED is a renormalizable theory, we found the issue of boundstate calculations within this theory insufficiently addressed in the literature. Our calculations for the\nleading-order self energy and the relativistic recoil correction are the first corrections of the \"self energy\ntype\" to be evaluated within bound-state QED involving only scalar particles.\nAs a further application, we would like to mention the recent investigation [18].\nIn the second Part of the Thesis, we investigate convergence acceleration and resummation methods\nfor divergent series. The convergence acceleration techniques address the fundamental problem of the\nacceleration of a slowly convergent, nonalternating series. Severe numerical instabilities associated with\nthe formation of higher-order weighted differences for nonalternating series have been a major obstacle\nfor algorithms that try to accomplish this task. The methods find applications in areas as diverse as DNA\nsequence analysis and experimental mathematics.\nRecent highly nontrivial 30-loop calculations [316, 317] have convincingly demonstrated the divergence\nof the perturbative expansions in quantum field theory originally conjectured by Dyson [320]. We discuss\nnonlinear sequence transformations as an alternative to the \"usual\" Borel method for the resummation of\ndivergent series that result from perturbative expansions in quantum field theory. These transformations\nhave favourable asymptotic properties and lead in many cases to better numerical results than Pad\u00e9\napproximants. We also discuss generalizations of the Borel method which lead to consistent results even\nif the full, nonperturbative physical energy level or vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude acquires an imaginary\npart due to quantum mechanical tunneling. This imaginary part, which represents the autoionization\ndecay width (Stark effect) and the electron-positron pair-production amplitude (in the case of the QED\neffective action), can be derived starting only from the real (not complex!) perturbative coefficients.\nIn the double-well problem, the situation is different. Even- and odd-parity states acquire an energy\nseparation which is nonperturbative and nonanalytic in the coupling strength and is an effect which in\nprinciple cannot be derived from perturbation theory alone. The energy separation is given by so-called\nmulti-instantons which follow naturally from a path integral representation of the partition function\nand correspond to configurations where the particle tunnels repeatedly between the two minima of the\ndouble-well potential. The results lead to a better understanding of the energy shifts due to multiinstanton effects, by evaluating higher-order corrections to the two-instanton effect, and they also lead to\nan accurate verification of the instanton expansion via a comparison to numerically determined energy\nlevels.\nThe common theme of all investigations discussed in is to to explore the predictive limits of quantum\ntheory. It has been the aim of this Thesis to present results for some of the essential QED corrections\nwhich influence the spectrum of bound systems and are of current experimental interest, as well as\nto work towards a solution of the questions regarding the predictive limits of field theories set by the\nultimate divergence of the perturbative expansion. Certain methods developed along this endeavour have\nmeanwhile found applications in other areas (applied biophysics and mathematics).\n\n112\n\n\fBibliography\n[1] U. D. Jentschura and K.

Sein nie nachlassendes Interesse an den zu untersuchenden Fragestellungen, seine Hilfsbereitschaft sowie die vielfache\nUnterst\u00fctzung meiner Forschungsaktivit\u00e4ten in Rat und Tat haben wesentlich zum Gelingen dieser Arbeit\nbeigetragen.\nWeiterhin gilt mein Dank allen Kollegen aus der Arbeitsgruppe \"Theorie der Hadronen und Kerne\" am\nInstitut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik der Technischen Universit\u00e4t Dresden. Die freundliche Atmosph\u00e4re am\nInstitut hat sich sehr positiv auf das Gelingen der vielf\u00e4ltigen Forschungsprojekte ausgewirkt. In diesem\nZusammenhang m\u00f6chte ich besonders den Institutssekret\u00e4rinnen G. Sch\u00e4dlich, G. Latus und U. W\u00e4chtler\nan dieser Stelle recht herzlich danken.\nEs ist mir eine besondere Freude, die wissenschaftlichen Kooperations\u2013Partner an dieser Stelle zu\nerw\u00e4hnen, mit denen ich das Vergn\u00fcgen und das Gl\u00fcck hatte, im Laufe der Arbeiten zusammenzukommen. Die Diskussionen waren Anlass zu h\u00f6chster intellektueller Freude und trugen wesentlich zum Genuss\nder wissenschaftlichen Arbeit bei. Man k\u00f6nnte behaupten, ein wichtiger Aspekt Wissenschaft werde in\nguter N\u00e4herung gerade durch die Diskussion und den sozialen Prozess des Austauschs der Gedanken\ndefiniert, und/oder der Austausch der Gedanken sei die Wissenschaft. Erw\u00e4hnt seien an dieser Stelle Frau\nProf. Dr. Emanuela Caliceti, Herr Prof. Dr. Victor Elias, Herr Dr. Holger Gies, Herr Prof. Dr. Vincenzo\nGrecchi, Herr Prof. Dr. Barry R. Holstein, Herr Prof. Dr. Paul J. Indelicato, Herr Dr. F. Krauss, Herr\nProf. Dr. Darrell R. Lamm, Herr Dr. Michael Meyer\u2013Hermann, Herr Dr. Peter J. Mohr, Herr Priv.\u2013Doz.\nDr. Krzysztof Pachucki, Herr Priv.\u2013Doz. Dr. G\u00fcnter Plunien, Herr Prof. Dr. Vladimir M. Shabaev, Herr\nProf. Dr. Sreeram Valluri, Herr Priv.\u2013Doz. Dr. Ernst Joachim Weniger, Herr Dr. Vladimir A. Yerokhin,\nsowie in besonderem Masse Herr Prof. Dr. Jean Zinn\u2013Justin.\nHerrn Dr. J. Sims vom National Institute of Standards and Technology sei herzlich gedankt f\u00fcr seine Hilfe\nbei der Entwicklung von parallelen Rechenprogrammen mit Hilfe des MPI Message Passing Interface.\nBesonderer Dank gilt auch meinen Eltern f\u00fcr wichtige Unterst\u00fctzung und Hilfe. Schliesslich gilt Sabine\nmein ganz besonderer Dank f\u00fcr Ihre immerw\u00e4hrende Unterst\u00fctzung, ihre Geduld und ihre Hingabe.\n\nThis work is based on a Habilitation Thesis which was submitted to the University of Technology, Dresden,\non 26 June 2002. It was defended on 14 April 2003. The current version is not identical to the habilitation thesis submitted to Dresden University of Technology; it contains hyperreferences and updates,\nand in addition a number of typographical errors present in the original Thesis have been eliminated.\nNumerical results in Eqs. (2.14)-(2.53) are in agreement with recently available data as reported in\n[U. D. Jentschura, E.-O. Le Bigot, P. Indelicato, P. J. Mohr and G. Soff, Asymptotic Properties of Self\u2013\nEnergy Coefficients, e-print physics/0304042, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 163001 (2003), and E.-O. Le Bigot,\nU. D. Jentschura, P. Indelicato, P. J. Mohr and G. Soff, e-print physics/0304068, Phys. Rev. A 68, 042101\n(2003)]. A number of biographic references (e.g. [30, 31, 109, 110, 111, 117]) have been updated, and some\nsection headings have been edited in order to be conformal with the hypertext standard for electronic\ndocuments (mathematical expressions cannot be used within pdf-bookmarks).\nThis thesis is the third in the traditional threefold sequence \"diploma(master)\u2013dissertation(PhD)\u2013\nhabilitation\" that is being followed in Continental Europe.
