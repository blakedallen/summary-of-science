Introduction\nWith the beginning of RHIC operation in the summer of 2000, a new regime of heavyion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies has become available. A measurement of the\nhadron pt distributions gives important information about the evolution of the system and\nthe conditions at freeze-out. The particle ratios, obtained from the transverse momentum\nspectra, are sensitive to the chemical properties of the system and the particle production\nmechanism [1].\n2. Set-up and Data Analysis\nThe PHENIX detector has various particle identification (PID) capabilities [2], including excellent hadron identification over a broad momentum range. The measurement\npresented in this paper was performed using the Beam-Beam counters (BBC) and the\nTime-of-flight (TOF) counters as the timing system, while the drift chamber and pad\nchamber 1 provided the momentum measurement. The acceptance covers the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 0.35 and azimuthal angle \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/4. Hadron identification was done\nin mass2 versus momentum space using momentum-dependent PID bands which take into\naccount the measured TOF and momentum resolution. Corrections to the raw spectra\nwere obtained using a single particle Monte-Carlo simulation. Multiplicity dependent efficiencies were studied by embedding Monte-Carlo tracks into real events. Track-by-track\nefficiency corrections were applied, taking into account the event multiplicity.\n\nFor the full PHENIX Collaboration author list and acknowledgments see the contribution by W.A.

The error bars include statistical errors and systematic\nerrors in the acceptance and decay corrections. Additional 20% sytematic errors on the\nabsolute normalization are not included.\n3. Results and Discussion\nFigure 1 shows the minimum bias pt spectra for \u03c0 +/\u2212 , K +/\u2212 , p and p . The lower\npt -cutoffs were imposed due to loss of acceptance and tracking efficiency, while the higher\npt -cutoff values for \u03c0 +/\u2212 and K +/\u2212 are dictated by the detector capability in \u03c0/K mass\nseparation.\nThe minimum bias data sample was divided into five centrality classes, using the correlation between the BBC and the Zero-degree calorimeters [3]. The number of nucleons,\nparticipating in the reaction (Npart ), was obtained using a Glauber model. For each centrality class, pt distributions were obtained for the six measured particle species. As an\nexample, Figure 2 shows the pt distributions for \u03c0 \u2212 and p. The centrality selections are\nindicated in the figure.\nThe centrality selected transverse mass spectra were fitted with a \u2217 exp(\u2212mt /Tef f ) in\nthe range 0.3 GeV/c < pt < 0.9 GeV/c for \u03c0 +/\u2212 , 0.55 GeV/c < pt < 1.6 GeV/c for K + , p\np and 0.75 GeV/c < pt < 1.6 GeV/c for K \u2212 . Figure 3 shows the inverse slope parameters\n(Tef f ) as a function of particle mass for the top 5% of the total interaction cross-section,\nminimum bias and 60-92% central events. A clear mass dependence is seen in the central\nand minimum bias events, consistent with radial flow. In peripheral collisions, the mass\ndependence is weaker, approaching \"mt -scaling\" behavior.\nA complementary measure of the transverse momentum spectra is the mean pt for\neach particle species over the whole pt range. In order to extrapolate the\u0012 range\nfrom 0 to\n\u0013\nq\ninfinity, the pt spectra were fitted with a\u2217(p0 +pt )\u2212n for \u03c0 +/\u2212 and a\u2217exp \u2212 m2 + p2t /T\n\n\f3\n\nPHENIX preliminary\n2\n\nnegative pions\n\n0-5%\n5 - 15 %\n15 - 30 %\n30 - 60 %\n60 - 92 %\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n10\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nanti-protons\n\n10\n1/2\u03c0 1/Nevt 1/pt d N/dptdy (c /GeV )\n\n10\n1/2\u03c0 1/Nevt 1/pt d N/dptdy (c /GeV )\n\nPHENIX preliminary\n2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\npt (GeV/c)\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\npt (GeV/c)\n\nFigure 2.

The resulting hpt i as a function of Npart are plotted in Figure 4. At\nRHIC, the pion and kaon hpt i is similar to that in pp collisions, and within errors is\nindependent of Npart . The observed hpt i for protons and anti-protons is higher than in pp\ncollisions and seems to increase logarithmically with Npart .\n4. Conclusion\nThe PHENIX measurement of transverse momentum distributions of identified charged\n\u221a\nhadrons at mid-rapidity in Au-Au collisions at sN N = 130 GeV covers a broad momentum range. We have obtained inverse slope parameters and hpt i for \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 , K + , K \u2212 ,\np and p as a function of centrality. The inverse slope parameters increase with particle\nmass, consistent with radial expansion of the system, which increases with centrality.\nHigh proton and anti-proton inverse slopes persist to high pt leading to significant baryon\nyield at pt > 2 GeV/c. Baryons may dominate the charged-particle spectrum beyond this\nmomentum.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nH.Ohnishi for the PHENIX collaboration, these proceedings.\nH.Hamagaki for the PHENIX collaboration, these proceedings.\nA.Milov for the PHENIX collaboration, these proceedings.\nT.Alexopoulos et.al.
