Introduction and summary\nRecently novel quantitative, dynamical tests of the duality between superconformal\nN = 4 Yang-Mills theory and type IIB superstrings on the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 space-time\nbackground have been performed [1]-[5]. They go beyond the BMN and the planewave approximations to, respectively, gauge and string theories [6], and rely on two\ncrucial observations. The first one is the existence of a sector of string states [1, 3, 7, 8]\nwhich is accessible by semiclassical [9, 10] methods, i.e. one avoids the unsolved problem of string quantization on a curved background. The second observation is that\nplanar N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory is integrable in the one-loop approximation,\nwhere it can be mapped to an integrable (super) spin chain [11, 12, 13]1 . By using\n1\n\nIt has been conjectured that the integrability extends to all loops [14].\n\n1\n\n\fthe powerful method of the algebraic Bethe ansatz the latter property allows one\nto find the exact one-loop anomalous dimensions of arbitrary local composite operators in the gauge theory and compare them with energies of the corresponding dual\nsemiclassical string states.\nSpecifically, on the string theory side one looks for solitonic solutions of the\nclassical string sigma model with finite energy and spins (i.e. the commuting global\ncharges of the SO(4,2)\u00d7 SO(6) isometry group of the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background). With\na natural spinning ansatz for the solution the sigma model evolution equations are\nreduced to that of the Neumann integrable system [4]. The latter have solutions\nof two different types corresponding to so-called folded and circular strings. Quite\nremarkably, in the thermodynamic limit the Bethe equations encoding the one-loop\nanomalous dimensions of the gauge theory operators exhibit the same types of solutions [2]. Moreover, one can show that in the limit of large spins2 the first subleading\n(order \u03bb) term in the string energy, which is a transcendental, parametric function\nof the spins, precisely agrees with the one-loop anomalous dimension of the corresponding operators both for the folded [2, 3] and for the circular [4] configuration\ntype.\nIt is clear that the Neumann system and the spin chain exhibit very different\ntypes of integrability. The first, striking difference is that one compares the classical\nNeumann system to a quantum spin chain3 . The second difference is that the Neumann model has a finite number (actually, just two) of integrals of motion while the\nspin chain exhibits, in the thermodynamical limit, an infinite set of local, commuting\nintegrals of motion. In both systems there are thus precisely as many integrals of\nmotion as required in order to allow for an exact solution. For the Neumann model\na certain linear combination of the two integrals gives the space-time energy of the\nstring. The model describes rigid strings (whose shape is time-independent) and\nthe ultimate role of the two integrals appears in a rather mild fashion: they merely\nspecify the topology of the solution (folded or circular). In gauge theory these different string topologies are reflected in the way the Bethe roots are distributed in\nthe complex plane. The energy is given by the lowest charge, but finding it appears\nto require simultaneously diagonalizing all charges. This is precisely what the Bethe\nansatz achieves. But what is the meaning of this infinite set of charges in the framework of the Neumann model? It is clearly important to ask whether one can find\nthem in the dual string theory description as well. Answering this question is the\nmain goal of this paper.\nBefore we proceed let us mention that the possible interrelation between the\nintegrability of the string theory on the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background and its field theory\n2\n\nPossible connections with the tensionless limit of string theory and gauge theory multiplet\nshortenings have recently been discussed in [15].\n3\nSee [16] for some ideas based on relation between the discretized Neumann system and the XYZ\nspin chain.\n\n2\n\n\fcounterpart has been recently discussed from the viewpoint of nonabelian (nonlocal)\nsymmetries generated by Yangians [17, 18, 19] (see also [20] for further developments).\nWe feel however that it is of primary importance to first understand the map between\nthe infinite families of local commuting integrals of motion, whose existence is crucial\nfor the solubility of the gauge and string theories at hand.\nActually it is well-known, starting from the work of Pohlmeyer [21], that the\nclassical principle sigma models and their various reductions (in particular the O(n)\nvector models we are interested in here) possess an infinite family of local commuting\ncharges [22, 23, 24]. The easiest way, perhaps, to exhibit this family is to use the\nso-called B\u00e4cklund transformation.\nLet us now come to the description of the present work and the results obtained.\nOur consideration starts from the one-loop gauge theory. We first construct the\ngenerating function (resolvent) of the infinite family of commuting local spin chain\ncharges Qn , as obtained from the Bethe solutions corresponding to folded and circular\nstring configurations. The first non-trivial charge Q2 , obtained already previously in\n[2, 5], is the eigenvalue of the one-loop dilatation operator, i.e. it gives the anomalous\ndimension. An intriguing feature of the family of gauge theory charges is that, if\nproperly defined, they satisfy \"BMN scaling\" [6]: The n-th charge Qn scales as J 1\u2212n ,\nwhere J is the total spin (i.e. the length of the chain).\nNext, using the B\u00e4cklund transformation for the O(6) model, we explicitly work\nout the first few commuting charges En in string theory and further evaluate them on\nthe folded and circular type solutions of the Neumann system. Here the first charge\nappears to coincide with the Hamiltonian of the Neumann system which, due to the\nVirasoro constraint, gives the energy of the string. In both the gauge and the string\ntheory computations the charges emerge as rather nontrivial combinations of elliptic\nintegrals governed by the gauge/string modular parameter. In each case the modular\nparameter is determined by a transcendental relation expressing it as a function of\nthe spins. The string theory calculation comprises the all-loop result for the higher\ncharges. In order to compare with the one-loop gauge theory predictions we develop\na perturbative expansion of En . The obtained \"one-loop\" charges predicted by string\ntheory do not yet satisfy the above mentioned property of BMN scaling. This is\nshown to be due to mixing effects, and BMN scaling can be recovered after some\nnatural linear redefinitions En \u2192 Qn . Finally, we demonstrate that a Gauss-Landen\nmodular transformation maps the entire family of commuting charges of string theory\nonto the one of the gauge theory!\nThis result nicely extends the correspondence picture: not only the energy of a\nstring state matches the anomalous dimension but also the higher string commuting\ncharges can be matched to those of the gauge theory. Although we have demonstrated this matching on some particular string/gauge solutions it is clear that all\nthis hints at a universal relation between the string sigma model and the spin chain:\nSemiclassically the string sigma model and the spin chain are the same. The Neu-\n\n3\n\n\fmann solutions and their gauge theory counterparts are just distinguished from the\n\"sea\" of all possible solutions by specifying the values of the infinite number of local\ncommuting charges. Further evidence for this universality comes from our finding\nthat the just mentioned linear redefinitions do not depend on the solution type.\nThe knowledge of the whole family of the string commuting charges relies essentially on on the knowledge of the solution of the B\u00e4cklund equations. As we\nwill see the perturbative solution can be pushed to any desired order in the spectral\nparameter \u03b3 but it does not allow us to obtain all the charges; an exact, i.e. nonperturbative in \u03b3, solution of the B\u00e4cklund equations is needed. Fortunately, the\nproblem of finding an exact solution turns out to have a beautiful resolution. The\nperturbative treatment shows that the B\u00e4cklund solution still solves the evolution\nequations of the Neumann model. On the other hand we know the most general\nsolution of the Neumann model; for the two-spin case it depends on one arbitrary\nconstant \u03bd, which can be assumed to depend on the spectral parameter \u03b3. The\nB\u00e4cklund equations are then used to determine the function \u03bd \u2261 \u03bd(\u03b3). In this way\nwe get the explicit spectral-dependent solution and use it to obtain the exact generating function (string spectral curve) E(\u03b3) of commuting charges in string theory.\nThe final expression for E(\u03b3) turns out to be rather simple. However, it generates\nunimproved charges, i.e. the charges do not yet obey BMN scaling. As was already\nmentioned, the charges with the \"proper\" one-loop BMN scaling can be obtained\nfrom the original unimproved charges by a certain linear redefinition, as we verified\nexplicitly to high order. This does not come as a surprise: Within the commuting\nfamily there is always freedom to apply arbitrary linear transformations on the complete set of charges. Using this freedom we are able to derive the complete generating\nfunction of higher one-loop gauge theory charges from string theory!\nThe upshot of the present work is then that we shed light on matching the\nintegrable structures on the gauge and string sides of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\nThis is done by way of example, for two specific cases. It would be very important\nto find the underlying general reasons for our findings. The structures on the gauge\nand string sides are still conceptually rather distinct. E.g. on the gauge side the\ncommuting charges are actually a crucial device, as they appear to be needed to find\nthe energies; on the other hand, on the string side we can find the energies without\nrequiring the knowledge of the higher charges: here they emerge, at this point, as a\nmere add-on. The reason for that can be traced to our assumption of the Neumann\n(rotating) ansatz which considerably restricts the possible string trajectories. To end,\nwe quite generally feel that the local commuting charges might well hold the key to\nunraveling the mysterious integrable structures of the planar AdS/CFT system.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In chapter 2 we explain how to derive the generating function of commuting charges in one-loop gauge theory, first quite generally,\nand subsequently in the specific case of the \"folded\" and \"circular\" root distribu-\n\n4\n\n\ftions. This is done by inspecting the detailed statistical distribution of Bethe roots\nin the integrable quantum spin chain approach. In chapter 3 we first discuss the\nclassical string solutions within the Neumann integrable ansatz. Then we describe\na perturbative construction of the B\u00e4cklund transformations and subsequently use\nit to compute the first few commuting charges in string theory. We furthermore\nshow that in the one-loop approximation these charges can be precisely matched to\nthose in the gauge theory. Then we show how the perturbative construction of the\nB\u00e4cklund transformation allows one to guess an ansatz for an exact solution of the\nB\u00e4cklund equations. In appendix A the B\u00e4cklund equations are solved exactly and\nthe solution is used in chapter 3 to construct the complete generating function for\ncommuting charges in string theory. As mentioned above this function generates\nunimproved charges. We therefore demonstrate in the final chapter 4 how to extract\nthe complete infinite set of one-loop gauge charges from the string generating function. To keep the presentation more transparent, we restrict ourselves in the main\ntext devoted to the string charges to the case of the folded string; the circular string\nis treated separately in appendix A. In appendix A we also discuss in some detail the\nmodular Gauss-Landen transformation which relates the gauge and the string theory\nquantities and explain its geometric meaning in our present context. In appendix B\nour conventions for elliptic integrals and elliptic functions are summarized.\n\n2. Higher one-loop charges in gauge theory\n2.1 Generalities\nLet us continue the study of the spectrum of the following single trace N = 4 gauge\ntheory operators which were shown to be dual to AdS strings rotating on the five\nsphere S 5 in two orthogonal planes with large angular momenta J1 ,J2 [2, 3, 5]:\nTr Z J1 \u03a6J2 + . . . ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nThese operators are composites of two (Z, \u03a6) out of the three complex scalar fields\nof the N = 4 gauge theory. The dots in eq.(2.1) indicate that the operator mixes in\nthe N = \u221e planar gauge theory with all single trace operators containing arbitrary\nsequences of J1 Z and J2 \u03a6 fields. We therefore need to diagonalize, i.e. find the\neigensystem, in the space of all these operators. This is a formidable problem even at\nthe one-loop level; it is solved by mapping it to the spectral problem of an equivalent\nXXX Heisenberg quantum spin chain [11], where the two fields are interpreted as,\nrespectively, up-spins and down-spins. The exact planar one-loop spectrum 4\u03c01 2 Q2 of\nthese operators is then parametrically determined [11] by the expression\nJ2\nJX\n1\nQ2 =\n2\n2 j=1 uj + 1/4\n\n5\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhere the parameters uj (the Bethe roots) are found by solving the following set of\nBethe equations for all J1 \u2265 J2 , where J = J1 + J2 :\nuj + i/2\nuj \u2212 i/2\n\n!J\n\n=\n\nJ2\nY\n\nk=1\nk6=j\n\nJ2\nY\n\nuj \u2212 uk + i\nuj \u2212 uk \u2212 i\n\nuj + i/2\n= 1.\nj=1 uj \u2212 i/2\n\n(2.3)\n\nNo two roots are allowed to coincide. A similar but obviously more involved situation\napplies to arbitrary composite operators in N = 4 gauge theory, where the Bethe\nequations are also known [13].\nWe are interested in the thermodynamic limit J, J2 \u2192 \u221e of these Bethe equations\nwith\nJ2\n\u03b1\u2261\n(2.4)\nJ\nheld fixed. The Bethe roots are expected to condense onto a union C = \u222an Cn of\nsmooth contours Cn in the complex plane of the continuous variable u:\nuj\n\u2192 u.\nJ\n\n(2.5)\n\nTheir distribution may be described by a density \u03c1(u) having support u \u2208 C on the\nunion of contours:\n\u03c1(u) =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nJ2\nuj\n1X\n\u03b4 u\u2212\n,\nJ j=1\nJ\n\nhence\n\nZ\n\nC\n\ndu \u03c1(u) = \u03b1.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe density allows to find the energy eq.(2.2) in the thermodynamic limit.\nQ2 =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\ndu\n\nC\n\n\u03c1(u)\n.\nu2\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe discrete Bethe equations eqs.(2.3) turn into\nZ\n\n\u03c1(v) u\n1\n\u2212 dv\n= + \u03c0 nC(u) u,\nv\u2212u\n2\nC\n\nwhere u \u2208 Cn\n\nand\n\nZ\n\nC\n\ndu\n\n\u03c1(u)\n= 0.\nu\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis system of singular integral equations (the bar through the integral indicates a\nprincipal part prescription) determines the density. The mode numbers nC(u) are integers which are expected to be constant on each smooth component Cn of the density\nsupport C. They appear since we need to take a logarithm of the discrete equations\nR\n(2.3) in order to derive eqs.(2.8), and are subject to the condition C du \u03c1(u) nC(u) = 0.\nThe solutions of the system of equations eqs.(2.8) have not yet been studied\nin any generality. Such a study would presumably lead to a classification of the\nlarge J1 , J2 spectrum of the operators (2.1). In general we expect solutions for any\nnumber of cuts Ci . An even larger system of singular integral equations, which has\nnot even yet been written down in public, governs the full set of Bethe equations\n[13] for arbitrary single trace operators in the thermodynamic limit. What has been\n\n6\n\n\fdone was a study of the simplest kinds of solution of eqs.(2.8) involving one or two\ncontours [2, 5]. These solutions are reviewed and further analyzed in sections 2.2.\nand 2.3.\nAt this point we should realize that the above solution of the \"thermodynamic\"\nspectral problem of the operators eq.(2.1) contains a lot more information than we\nhave used so far. The Bethe integral equations eqs.(2.8) allow to determine the root\ndistribution density \u03c1(u) which is then merely used to extract the energy eigenvalue\neq.(2.7).\nE.g. the so far obtained solutions [2, 5] found for \u03c1(u) an elliptic curve, ubiquitously present in integrable systems. The resulting charge Q2 was successfully\nmatched to a string computation [3, 5]. It is thus very natural to ask whether the\nentire \"gauge curve\" \u03c1(u) also has an interpretation on the string side. We will\nfind that the answer to this question is: Yes indeed! In fact, solving the Bethe\nansatz equations eqs.(2.3) leads not only to the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian\nQ2 (=lowest charge) of the spin chain, but also simultaneously diagonalizes the entire\nset of commuting charges Qk . These are generated by the transfer matrix T (u) of\nthe discrete spin chain through\nQk+1 = \u2212\n\ni J k dk\nlog T (u)\n2 k! duk\nu= i\n\n(2.9)\n\n2\n\nEach Bethe state, determined through eqs.(2.3), is an eigenstate of T (u) for arbitrary\ncomplex values of the spectral parameter u. Its eigenvalue is\n\u0012\n\nT (u) = u +\n\ni\n2\n\n\u0013J Y\nJ2\n\n\u0012\n\nu \u2212 uj \u2212 i\ni\n+ u\u2212\nu \u2212 uj\n2\nj=1\n\n\u0013J Y\nJ2\n\nu \u2212 uj + i\n.\nu \u2212 uj\nj=1\n\n(2.10)\n\nDropping an irrelevant uj -independent constant, we find in the thermodynamic limit\n(2.5),(2.6) for the charges\nZ\n1\n\u03c1(u)\nQk =\n(2.11)\ndu k .\n2 C\nu\nClearly the commuting charges are non-unique up to linear (or even polynomial)\nredefinitions. Our definition eq.(2.9), which is standard except for the factor J k ,\nensures that the charges behave properly (i.e. they are of order O(1)) in the scaling\nlimit (2.5),(2.6). It is natural to introduce a generating function of all conserved\ncharges Qk (the resolvent). It is given by\n\u221e\n\u03b1 1X\nH(u) = +\nQk uk ,\n2 2 k=1\n\n1\nH(u) =\n2\n\ni.e.\n\nZ\n\nC\n\ndv \u03c1(v)\n\nv\nv\u2212u\n\n(2.12)\n\nand thus analytically defined throughout the complex u plane, except for the cuts Ci .\nLet us now, for the reminder of this chapter, compute the resolvent for the known\ncases of the \"folded\" and \"circular\" cases and thereby derive the infinite number of\ncommuting charges for these solutions. In the next chapter these one-loop charges\nwill be reproduced on the string side.\n\n7\n\n\f2.2 Folded case\nLet us first reconsider the large J1 , J2 ground state energy of the operators (2.1)\n[2, 5]. In this case the roots condense on two curved, convex cuts C = C + \u222a C \u2212\nwhich are symmetric w.r.t reflection on both the real and imaginary axis. In order\nto have explicit formulas, we will again discuss the related case where the two cuts\n(C \u2212 \u2192 [\u2212b, \u2212a] and C + \u2192 [a, b]) are located on the real axis in the u-plane: This\ncorresponds to analytically continuing the filling fraction \u03b1 = J2 /J to negative values\n[2, 5]. The thermodynamic Bethe equations become\nZ\n\n\u03c1(v) u2\n1 \u03c0\n\u2212 dv 2\n= \u2212 u,\n2\nv \u2212u\n4 2\na\nb\n\nQ2 =\n\nZ\n\nb\n\na\n\ndu\n\n\u03c1(u)\n.\nu2\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe first equation is closely related to the saddle point equation of the O(\u00b12) matrix\nmodel (see e.g. [25]). Physically this corresponds to a string rotating with one spin\non AdS5 and one angular momentum on S 5 [5], but we will not make use of this fact\nin this paper. The previously obtained solution reads\nv\nu\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2 Zb\nv2 u\nt (b \u2212 u )(u \u2212 a ) .\n\u03c1(u) =\n\u2212 dv 2\n\u03c0u a\nv \u2212 u2 (b2 \u2212 v 2 )(v 2 \u2212 a2 )\n\n(2.14)\n\nwith the normalization (remember \u03b1 < 0, i.e. formally J < 0)\nZ\n\nb\n\na\n\n\u03b1\ndu \u03c1(u) = \u2212 .\n2\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe interval boundaries are determined by\na=\n\n1\n,\n4K(q)\n\n1\nb= \u221a\n.\n4 1 \u2212 q K(q)\n\n(2.16)\n\nHere K(q) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (see appendix B on our\nconventions for elliptic integrals and elliptic functions). The density may be expressed\nexplicitly through the elliptic integral of the third kind:\n1\n\u03c1(u) =\n2\u03c0bu\n\ns\n\n\"\n\nb2 \u2212 u2\nu2 \u2212 a2 b2\n2\n\u2212\n4u\n\u03a0\n,q\nb2 \u2212 u2 a\nb2\n\n!#\n\n,\n\nq=\n\nb2 \u2212 a2\n,\nb2\n\n(2.17)\n\nFrom this it is straightforward to obtain the energy eigenvalue Q2 in the parametric\nform\nh\ni\nQ2 = 2 K(q) (2 \u2212 q)K(q) \u2212 2E(q) ,\n(2.18)\n\nwith\n\n\u2212\u03b1 \u2261 \u2212\n\nJ2\n1\nE(q) 1\n= \u221a\n\u2212 .\nJ\n2 1 \u2212 q K(q) 2\n\n(2.19)\n\nThis rather involved final result, first obtained in [2, 5] agrees with the one-loop\nprediction of semiclassical string theory [3, 5]. This ends our short review and we\n\n8\n\n\fwill now compute the higher charges, using the procedure explained in the previous\nsection.\nFor the even charges (the odd charges vanish on the unpaired ground state we\nare interested in) we have\nZ b\n\u03c1(u)\ndu 2k .\nQ2k =\n(2.20)\nu\na\n\u221e\n\u03b1 X\nQ2k u2k ,\nH(u) = \u2212 +\n2 k=1\n\ni.e.\n\nH(u) =\n\nZ\n\nb\n\na\n\nv2\ndv\u03c1(v) 2\n.\nv \u2212 u2\n\n(2.21)\n\nOn the cut u \u2208 [a, b] this function behaves as H(u \u00b1 i\u01eb) = \u2212 \u03b12 + 41 \u2212 \u03c02 u \u00b1 i \u03c02 u\u03c1(u).\nIt is therefore straightforward to obtain an integral representation of the resolvent\nv\nu\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b1 1 Z b dv v 2 u\nt (b \u2212 u )(a \u2212 u ) .\nH(u) = \u2212 + \u2212\n2 4\n(b2 \u2212 v 2 )(v 2 \u2212 a2 )\na v 2 \u2212 u2\n\n(2.22)\n\nJust like the density eq.(2.17) we can also express it explicitly with the help of the\nelliptic integral of the third kind:\n1\n\u03b1 1 \u03c0\nH(u) = \u2212 + \u2212 u \u2212\n2 4 2\n4b\n\ns\n\n\"\n\na2 \u2212 u2 b2\nb2 \u2212 u2\n2\n\u2212\n4u\n\u03a0\n,q\nb2 \u2212 u2 a\nb2\n\n!#\n\n.\n\n(2.23)\n\nThis is not the most convenient form to perform the power series expansion around\nu = 0. A further, more suitable representation for H(u) is\n\u03b1 1 a2\nH(u) = \u2212 + \u2212\n2 4\nb\n\ns\n\n!\n\nb2 \u2212 u2\nu2\n\u03a0\n\u2212q\n,q .\na2 \u2212 u2\na2 \u2212 u2\n\n(2.24)\n\nFrom this expression we can easily obtain the explicit form of the higher charges; the\nfirst few read\nh\ni\n23\nK(q)3 4(q \u2212 2)E(q) + (8 \u2212 8q + 3q 2 )K(q) ,\n(2.25)\n3\nh\ni\n26\nK(q)5 \u2212 2(8 \u2212 8q + 3q 2 )E(q) + (16 \u2212 24q + 18q 2 \u2212 5q 3 )K(q) ,\n=\n5\nh\ni\n27\nK(q)7 8(q \u2212 2)(8 \u2212 8q + 5q 2 )E(q) + (128 \u2212 256q + 288q 2 \u2212 160q 3 + 35q 4 )K(q) ,\n=\n7\nh\n210\n=\nK(q)9 (\u2212256 + 512q \u2212 576q 2 + 320q 3 \u2212 70q 4 )E(q)\n9\ni\n\u2212 (q \u2212 2)(128 \u2212 256q + 352q 2 \u2212 224q 3 + 63q 4 )K(q) ,\n\nQ4 =\nQ6\nQ8\nQ10\n\n..\n.\n\nIn the next chapter we will demonstrate how to \"perturbatively\" (in u) find these\ncharges on the string side. In the final chapter 4 we will then rigorously derive the\nentire generating function eq.(2.24) from string theory. However, before doing so we\nwill also treat the Bethe solution corresponding to the circular string.\n\n9\n\n\f2.3 Circular case\nThe configuration of Bethe roots corresponding to the circular string was found in\n[2], chapter 4 (see also [5], appendix D). As opposed to the folded case, this is not\nthe ground state of the spin chain. For the convenience of the reader we will closely\nfollow4 [2, 5]. In the present case the roots are distributed on a single, connected curve\nC along the imaginary axis. Around the origin an odd number J2\u2032 (with J2\u2032 < J2 \u2264 J1\nand J = J1 + J2 ) of roots are placed in the near vicinity of the half-integer purely\nimaginary values, i.e. their density is constant (= 2 since there are two roots per\nJ \u2032 \u22121\ninteger interval on the imaginary axis), up to \u00b1ic with c = 24J . Further away the\ndistribution is less dense (i.e. \u03c3e (x) < 2) and non-constant. Let us replace the variable\nu parametrizing the Bethe plane by u = ix. The density \u03c3(x) \u2261 \u03c1(u) then has the\nform\n\n\u03c3(x) =\n\n1\nJ\n\n\u0012\nJ2\nX\n\n\u03b4 x+i\n\nj=1\n\nuj\nJ\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c3(x) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f42\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c3\ne (x)\n\uf8f4\n\u03c3e (\u2212x)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u2212c < x < c,\nc < x < d,\n(2.26)\n\u2212d < x < \u2212c,\nx < \u2212d or d < x\n\n0\n\nDue to the constant condensate around the origin we again end up with a two-cut\nproblem, despite the fact that all roots lie on one continuous curve C! The continuum\nBethe equations and, respectively, the lowest charge (i.e. energy) read\nZ\n\n1\nx+c\nx2\n= \u2212 x log\n\u2212 dy \u03c3e (y) 2\n2\nx \u2212y\n4\nx\u2212c\nc\nd\n\n2\nQ2 = \u2212\nc\n\nZ\n\nc\n\nd\n\ndx\n\n\u03c3e (x)\n.\nx2\n\n(2.27)\n\nThe solution is\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nZ c\n1q 2\n1\ndy\n1\n\uf8f8 , (2.28)\nq\n\u03c3e (x) =\n(d \u2212 x2 )(x2 \u2212 c2 ) \uf8ed\u2212\n+4\n2\u03c0\nxcd\n\u2212c x \u2212 y\n(d2 \u2212 y 2)(c2 \u2212 y 2 )\n\nwith the normalization\n\n2c +\n\nZ\n\nc\n\nd\n\ndx \u03c3e (x) =\n\n\u03b1\n.\n2\n\n(2.29)\n\nThe interval boundaries are determined through\nc=\n\n1\n,\n8K(r)\n\n1\nd= \u221a\n.\n8 r K(r)\n\n(2.30)\n\nThe density may again be expressed explicitly\n!\n\n4\n\n4 q 2\nx2\n\u03c3e (x) = 2 \u2212\n(d \u2212 x2 )(x2 \u2212 c2 ) \u03a0 2 , r ,\n\u03c0dx\nd\n\nr=\n\nc2\n.\nd2\n\n(2.31)\n\nHowever, in order (1) to avoid confusions with the notation in other parts of the present paper,\nand (2) to agree with the perhaps more natural normalization of the folded string, we have decided\nto make the following notational changes w.r.t. [2, 5]: (1) q \u2192 x, q \u2032 \u2192 y, s \u2192 c, t \u2192 d and (2)\n\u03c3(q) \u2192 2\u03c3(x).\n\n10\n\n\fThe energy eigenvalue is, similar to, but different from eq.(2.18), parametrically given\nby\nh\ni\nQ2 = 8K(r) 2E(r) + (r \u2212 1)K(r)\n(2.32)\nwith\n\n\u221a\nr\u22121\n1 E(r)\nJ2\n= \u221a + \u221a\n.\n\u03b1\u2261\nJ\n2 r\n2 r K(r)\n\n(2.33)\n\nThese are the gauge results derived for the circular string in [2, 5] and successfully\ncompared to semiclassical string theory in [4].\nAs for the previous case of the folded solution we would now like to also extract\nthe higher charges from the density function eq.(2.31). Naively these should be given,\ncf eqs.(2.11),(2.20), by the expression\n?\n\nQ2k = (\u22121)k\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd\n\ndx\n\n\u03c3(x)\n.\nx2k\n\n(2.34)\n\nHowever, this formula is clearly nonsensical: The density \u03c3(x) is constant at the\norigin, and the above expression therefore diverges at x = 0. Let us go back to\nthe original definition of the higher charges for the finite spin chain with discrete\nroots uj = ixj , i.e. eqs.(2.9),(2.10), and investigate the thermodynamic limit more\ncarefully. As we are assuming J to be large (i.e. the second term in the transfer\nmatrix eq.(2.10) does not contribute) we have\nQ2k\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\nJ2\nY\ni2k J 2k\u22121 \uf8f0 d2k\u22121\nx \u2212 xj \u2212 1 \uf8fb\n=\nlog\n2k\u22121\n2 (2k \u2212 1)! dx\nx \u2212 xj\nj=1\n\n+ ...\n\n(2.35)\n\nx= 21\n\nwhere the dots indicate an xj -independent constant, which we can drop. We had\nassumed that all roots uj = ixj scale as \u223c J. This is clearly not the case for the roots\nnear the origin. However, these are condensed at half-integer values of the imaginary\naxis, and their contribution to the transfer matrix mostly cancels, see eq.(2.35).

Interestingly, eq.(2.37) coincides with an ad-hoc regularization of the naive formula eq.(2.34), where one just drops the divergence at\nthe lower limit of the integration.

Higher semiclassical charges in string theory\n3.1 Classical string solutions\nThe classical closed bosonic string propagating in the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 space-time is described in terms of the O(6)\u00d7O(4,2) sigma model. As was shown in [4], rigid string\nsolitons (i.e. strings with a time-independent profile) are classified in terms of periodic solutions of the Neumann integrable system. The Neumann system arises from\nthe sigma model equations of motion after specifying a rotating string ansatz for\nthe embedding coordinates.5 In particular, for the motion on S 5 the rotating ansatz\n5\n\nMore precisely, one obtains two Neumann systems: The \"compact\" system originating from the\nO(6) part and the \"non-compact\" one related to the O(4,2) part. The conformal gauge constraint\nimposes one equation between the conserved energies of the systems.\n\n12\n\n\freads\nX1 + iX2 = x1 (\u03c3) eiw1 \u03c4 ,\n\nX3 + iX4 = x2 (\u03c3) eiw2 \u03c4 ,\n\nX5 + iX6 = x3 (\u03c3) eiw3 \u03c4 ,\n\nwhere Xi are the embedding coordinates of S 5 . The variables xi (\u03c3) satisfy the\ndynamical equations of the Neumann system and the relation\n3\nX\n\nx2i = 1 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhich implies that at a fixed moment in time the string lies on a two-dimensional\nsphere S 2 . In addition the xi (\u03c3) obey the closed string periodicity condition:\nxi (\u03c3 + 2\u03c0) = xi (\u03c3) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe rotation on S 5\u221awith the frequencies wi gives rise to three angular momentum\nintegrals (spins) J\u221a\n\u03bbJi . Due to the Virasoro constraint the space-time energy\ni =\nof the string E = \u03bbE becomes a function of the spins:\nE = E(J1 , J2 , J3 ) .\n\n(3.3)\n\nFrom now on we will restrict our consideration to string solitons carrying only two\nnon-vanishing spin components, J1 and J2 . Needless to say, it would be quite interesting to extend the analysis below to the general three-spin case, using as an input\n[4].\nRecall that the solutions for xi depend on a discrete choice for the relative position of the two Neumann integrals w.r.t. to the frequencies wi2 : these can be of two\ntypes, corresponding to folded or circular string geometries. Below we will review\nthese solutions [3, 4].\nFolded string solution\nThe embedding coordinates for the folded string configuration are solved in terms of\nthe standard Jacobi elliptic functions (cf. appendix B) as follows (wij2 \u2261 wi2 \u2212 wj2 ):\n\u0010 q\n\u0011\n\u0010 q\n\u0011\n\u221a\n2\n2\nx1 (\u03c3) = dn \u03c3 w21\n, t , x2 (\u03c3) = t sn \u03c3 w21\n, t , x3 (\u03c3) = 0 ,\n(3.4)\n\nHere the Jacobi modulus t is determined through the closed string periodicity condition (for simplicity we consider the solution with the winding number n = 1, cf. the\ngeneral discussion of winding numbers in [4]):\n\u03c0q 2\nw21 = K(t) ,\n2\n\nw2 > w1\n\n(3.5)\n\nand, solving for w's in terms of spins Ji , it can be further found from the equation\nJ2\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\nJ1\n\u2212\nE(t)\n\n13\n\n!2\n\n=\n\n4\n.\n\u03c02\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fCircular string solution\nThe circular type configuration is described by\n\u0010\n\ns\n\n2\n\u0011\nw12\nx1 (\u03c3) = sn \u03c3\n, t ,\nt\n\n\u0010\n\nx2 (\u03c3) = cn \u03c3\n\ns\n\n2\n\u0011\nw12\n, t ,\nt\n\nx3 (\u03c3) = 0 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhile the equation for the modulus (again for the winding number n = 1) is\n\u03c0\n2\n\ns\n\n2\nw12\n= K(t) ,\nt\n\nw1 > w2\n\n(3.8)\n\nand it can be reexpressed via the spins as follows\nJ1\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\nJ2\n\u2212\n(1 \u2212 t)K(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\n=\n\n4\n.\n\u03c02t\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn fact, for the case of two non-zero spins the evolution equations of the Neumann\nmodel coincide with those of a plane pendulum in a gravitational field. Its motion\nhas two phases, either oscillatory or rotating, which in the present stringy context\ntranslate into the folded or circular type solutions, respectively.\n3.2 B\u00e4cklund transformation and the conserved charges\nOne possible way to construct an infinite family of local commuting integrals of\nmotion for a sigma model is to use the B\u00e4cklund transformations. These transform\na solution of the evolution equations into a new one. The transformation can be\nusually constructed by perturbing (\"dressing\") some trial solution.6\nRecall that in light-cone coordinates \u03be, \u03b7, where \u03c4 = \u03be + \u03b7, and \u03c3 = \u03be \u2212 \u03b7, the\nevolution equations for the O(6) sigma model read as\nX\u03be\u03b7 + (X\u03be * X\u03b7 )X = 0 ,\n\n(X * X) = 1 ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere X\u03be denotes the derivative of X w.r.t. to the variable \u03be, and so on, and (X\u03be *X\u03b7 )\nis the scalar product of two vectors.\nOur basic idea is to use the folded or circular strings as trial solutions and to\ndress them. When the new solution is found it can be used to obtain the values of\nthe local commuting charges on the trial solution.\nIn terms of the embedding coordinates Xi the B\u00e4cklund transformations for the\nO(6) model can be described by the following set of equations (see e.g. [23])\n2\u03b3 2 (X(\u03b3) + X)\u03be = (1 + \u03b3 2 )(X(\u03b3) * X\u03be )(X(\u03b3) \u2212 X) ,\n6\n\n2(X(\u03b3) \u2212 X)\u03b7 = \u2212(1 + \u03b3 2 )(X(\u03b3) * X\u03b7 )(X(\u03b3) + X)\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe B\u00e4cklund transformations should not be confused with the so-called dressing transformations whose generators are subject to a nonabelian algebra (see e.g. [26]).\n\n14\n\n\ftogether with the normalization conditions\n(X(\u03b3) * X(\u03b3)) = 1 ,\n\nX(0) = X ,\n\n(X(\u03b3) * X) =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n.\n1 + \u03b32\n\n(3.12)\n\nHere \u03b3 is a spectral parameter and X is a trial solution. Solving eqs.(3.11) we obtain\nanother solution X(\u03b3) of the evolution equations (3.10) which is the dressing of our\ntrial solution X. The equations (3.11) admit a solution in terms of a power series in\nthe spectral parameter \u03b3\nX(\u03b3) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nX (k) \u03b3 k ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere the coefficients X (k) can be found recurrently to any desired order.\nThe generating function of the local commuting charges of the O(6) sigma model\n\u221e\nX\n\nEk \u03b3 k\n\n(3.14)\n\ni\nd\u03c3 h\n\u03b3(X(\u03b3) * X\u03be ) + \u03b3 3 (X(\u03b3) * X\u03b7 ) .\n4\u03c0\n\n(3.15)\n\nE(\u03b3) =\n\nk=2\n\ncan be obtained from the dressed solution:\nE(\u03b3) =\n\nZ\n\nLet us now discuss the perturbative construction of the dressed solution X(\u03b3).\nPlugging the ansatz (3.13) into eqs.(3.11), (3.12) it is easy to determine the first few\ncoefficients X (k) :\nX\n\n(0)\n\n=X,\n\nX\n\n(1)\n\n2X\u03be\n=\n,\n||X\u03be ||\n\nq\n\n(1)\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\nX\n= \u03be ,\n||X\u03be ||\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere we have introduced ||X\u03be || = (X\u03be * X\u03be ). The general coefficient X (k) can be\nobtained recurrently from X (l) with l < k:\nX (k+1) =\n\ni\n1 h (k)\nX\u03be\n(k)\nY \u2212\n(Y\n*\nX\n)\n,\n\u03be\n2||X\u03be ||\n2||X\u03be ||2\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere\nY\n\n(k)\n\n=\n\n(k)\n2X\u03be\n\n\u2212\n\nk\u22121\nXh\nl=1\n\ni\n\n(X (l) * X\u03be )X (k\u2212l) + (X (l+1) * X\u03be )X (k+1\u2212l) .\n\n(3.18)\n\nThe coefficients Ek of the generating function E(\u03b3), which are mutually commuting conserved charges, are then given by\nEk =\n\nZ\n\ni\nd\u03c3 h (k\u22121)\n(X\n* X\u03be ) + (X (k\u22123) * X\u03b7 ) ,\n4\u03c0\n\nHere (X (k) * X\u2212 ) = 0 for k negative.\n\n15\n\nk \u2265 2.\n\n(3.19)\n\n\f3.3 Perturbative matching of string and gauge theory charges\nHere we compute the values of the first few conserved charges (3.19) on the solution\nof the Neumann system corresponding to the folded string and show that up to some\nnatural linear redefinition they match precisely those found in one-loop gauge theory.\nMatching of the charges on the circular type solution is discussed in appendix A.\nThe charge E2 follows easily upon substituting the Neumann ansatz into (3.19):\nE2 =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3 (1)\n(X * X\u03be ) =\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd\u03c3\n||X\u03be || = 2H .\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.20)\n\nHere (the prime denotes a derivative w.r.t. \u03c3)\n3\n1X\n2\nH=\nx\u2032i + wi2 x2i\n2 i=1\n\n(3.21)\n\nis nothing but the Hamiltonian of the Neumann system. Due to the Virasoro constraint the charge E2 coincides with the space-time energy E2 \u2261 E of the string. Note\nthat H is in fact a \"doubly\" conserved quantity: It is independent with respect to\nboth \u03c4 and \u03c3.\nThe next odd integral E3 is found to be zero as a consequence of the relation\n(1)\n(X\u03be * X\u03be ) = 0.\nIn principle, the higher charges, e.g. the fourth one,\nE4 =\n\nZ\n\ni\nd\u03c3 h (3)\n(X * X\u03be ) + (X (1) * X\u03b7 ) ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhen computed on the generic Neumann solution xi (\u03c3), can also be expressed as\nfunctionals of xi and its derivative7 x\u2032i , i.e. En = En (xi , x\u2032i ). However, already for\nE4 the resulting answer is rather complicated and not very instructive. Hence, we\nrestrict ourselves to finding the value of the charges on the special folded string\nsolution described in the previous section.\nOn the folded string solution (3.4) the result of the evaluation of the integral E4\ncan be compactly written in the form\nE4 = \u2212\n\nh\ni\n32\n16\nK(t)\nE(t)\n+\n(t\n\u2212\n1)K(t)\n+ 4 3 t(t \u2212 1)K(t)4 .\n2\n\u03c0 E2\n\u03c0 E2\n\n(3.23)\n\nSome comments are in order. The initial result for E4 depends on the Neumann\nfrequencies w1 and w2 . We find it convenient to replace the frequencies by the\nJacobi modulus t and the second charge E2 . To this end we recall [3, 4] that for the\nfolded string the periodicity condition and the charge E2 written in terms of the w's\nare (cf. eq.(3.5) and eq.(3.21))\nK(t)2 =\n7\n\n\u03c02 2\nw ,\n4 21\n\n2\nE22 = w12 + tw21\n.\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u2032\u2032\nThe higher derivatives, x\u2032\u2032i , x\u2032\u2032\u2032\ni , . . . are expressed via xi and xi by using the equations of motion.\n\n16\n\n\fThese formulae allow one to eliminate the w's. We represent the final result as an\nexpansion in inverse powers of E2 .\nComing to the next charge E5 it can be shown that its integrand is a total\nderivative in the variable \u03c3 and, therefore, E5 vanishes. Evaluation of E6 is similar\nto E4 , the result is\nh\ni\n25\nK(t)\nE(t)\n+\n(t\n\u2212\n1)K(t)\n\u03c0 2 E2\nh\ni\n26\n3\n(8t\n\u2212\n4)E(t)\n+\n(t\n\u2212\n1)(15t\n\u2212\n4)K(t)\nK(t)\n\u2212\n3\u03c0 4 E23\nh\ni\n29\n5 * 29\n+ 6 5 t(t \u2212 1)K(t)5 E(t) + (3t \u2212 2)K(t) \u2212 8 7 t2 (t \u2212 1)2 K(t)8 . (3.25)\n\u03c0 E2\n\u03c0 E2\n\nE6 =\n\nThe expressions for E4 and E6 already suggest a general pattern: All the odd\ncharges are zero while the even charges admit an expansion in odd powers of the\ninverse second charge.\nThe conserved charges En comprise an all-loop result. To compare with gauge\ntheory we need to extract the one-loop contribution. Assuming J = J1 + J2 large\none first solves the equation for the Jacobi modulus (3.6) by power series expansion\nt = t0 + t2 /J 2 + .... This implies in particular the following relation between the\nfilling fraction \u03b1 and the modulus t0 :\n\u03b1=\n\nE(t0 )\nJ2\n=1\u2212\n.\nJ\nK(t0 )\n\n(3.26)\n\nThen one can easily verify that the non-trivial string charges admit the following\nlarge J expansion:\nEn = \u03b42,n J +\n\n\u01eb(2) \u01eb(3)\n\u01eb(1)\nn\n+ n 3 + n 5 + ...\nJ\nJ\nJ\n\n(3.27)\n\nNote that only the second charge scales with J to leading order. In the expansion\n(3.27) all the coefficients \u01eb(k)\nn are functions of t0 , while t0 is determined by eq.(3.26).\nIn particular we have\n(1)\n\n\u01eb2 =\n\nh\ni\n2\nK(t\n)\nE(t\n)\n\u2212\n(1\n\u2212\nt\n)K(t\n)\n0\n0\n0\n0 .\n\u03c02\n\n(3.28)\n(1)\n\nWorking out the expansion (3.27) for E4 we find that the expression for \u01eb4 coincides\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nup to a numerical coefficient with \u01eb2 : \u01eb4 = \u22128\u01eb2 . Thus, at order 1/J the charges\nE2 and E4 are not independent. This suggests that the following redefinition of the\nfourth charge should be made\nE4 \u2192 E4 + 8(E2 \u2212 J ) .\n\n17\n\n(3.29)\n\n\fIndeed, the expansion of the redefined charge starts from the 1/J 3 term and we\nobtain\nh\ni\n16\n(2)\n(2)\nQ4 \u2261 \u01eb4 + 8\u01eb2 = 4 K(t0 )3 (2t0 \u2212 1)E(t0 ) + (1 \u2212 4t0 + 3t20 )K(t0 ) . (3.30)\n\u03c0\nAnalogously we find that at orders 1/J and 1/J 3 the charge E6 is a linear combination of the lower charges E2 and E4 . Again this redundant information contained in\nE6 can be removed by redefining it as\nE6 \u2192 E6 +\n\n22\n128\n(E2 \u2212 J ) + E4 .\n3\n3\n\n(3.31)\n\nThe expansion of the redefined charge starts from 1/J 5 and the coefficient reads\n(3)\n\nQ6 \u2261 \u01eb6 +\n\n128 (3) 22 (3)\n\u01eb + \u01eb4 =\n3 2\n3\n\n(3.32)\n\nh\ni\n29\n2\n2\n5\n(1\n\u2212\n6t\n+\n6t\n)E(t\n)\n+\n(t\n\u2212\n1)(1\n\u2212\n8t\n+\n10t\n)K(t\n)\nK(t\n)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 .\n0\n0\n0\n3\u03c0 6\n\nThus, we see that after redefinition the (improved) charges scale homogeneously with\ninverse powers of 1/J , i.e. like Qn /J n\u22121 , as was the case for the conserved charges\nof the one-loop gauge theory.\nConcerning the next two charges we just point out that they require the following\nredefinition\n1024\n201\n44\nE8 \u2192 E8 +\n(E2 \u2212 J ) +\nE4 + E6 ,\n5\n5\n5\n6922\n1898\n74\n32768\n(E2 \u2212 J ) +\nE4 +\nE6 + E8\nE10 \u2192 E10 +\n35\n35\n35\n7\nand the corresponding values of the improved charges are\nQ8 =\n\nQ10 =\n\nh\n211\n7\nK(t\n)\n(2t0 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 10t0 + 10t20 )E(t0 )\n0\n\u03c08\ni\n+ (t0 \u2212 1)(\u22121 + 15t0 \u2212 45t20 + 35t30 )K(t0 ) ,\n\nh\n217\n9\nK(t\n)\n(1 \u2212 20t0 + 90t20 \u2212 140t30 + 70t40 )E(t0 )\n0\n5\u03c0 10\ni\n+ (t0 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 24t0 + 126t20 \u2212 224t30 + 126t40 )K(t0 ) .\n\nNow we will demonstrate that the improved large J string theory charges Q2n\nand the one-loop gauge theory charges Q2n are actually the same. The charges Q2n\n(1)\ndepend on the string modulus t0 , while the Q2n are governed by q. Matching Q2 \u2261 \u01eb2\nwith Q2 requires that the string modulus is related to the gauge theory modulus by\na Gauss-Landen transformation [4, 5], which for the folded string solution is of the\nform\n\u221a\n(1 \u2212 1 \u2212 q)2\n\u221a\n.\n(3.33)\nt0 = \u2212\n4 1\u2212q\n\n18\n\n\fUnder this transformation one has\nK(t0 ) = (1 \u2212 q)1/4 K(q),\n\n1\n1\nE(t0 ) = (1 \u2212 q)\u22121/4 E(q) + (1 \u2212 q)1/4 K(q) .\n2\n2\n\n(3.34)\n\nRemarkably this maps not only the energy, but all higher large J string charges\nQ2n onto the one-loop gauge charges Q2n . Indeed, transforming the first few (cf\neqs.(3.30), (3.32)) Q2n with (3.33), (3.34) we obtain\n1\n3\n5\nQ2 , Q4 = 4 Q4 , Q6 = \u2212\nQ6 ,\n2\n4\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n12\u03c0 6\n7\n9\nQ8 =\nQ8 , Q10 = \u2212\nQ10 , . . . .\n8\n16\u03c0\n20\u03c0 10\n\nQ2 = \u2212\n\n(3.35)\n\nUp to unessential numerical prefactors the improved \"one-loop\" string charges Qn\ncoincide with the gauge theory charges Qn , cf eqs.(2.25) in section 2.2. An all orders\nproof will be presented in chapter 4, and the exact matching formula turns out to be\nQ2k = (\u22121)k\n\n2k \u2212 1\nQ2k .\n4k\u03c0 2k\n\n(3.36)\n(n)\n\nWe note a certain similarity of the higher terms \u01eb2 in the expansion of E2 ,\ncorresponding to the currently unknown eigenvalues of the dilatation operator at\nhigher loops, and the \"one-loop\" higher charges Qn . For instance,\n(2)\n\n\u01eb2 = \u2212\n\nh\ni\n2\n2\n3\n(2t\n\u2212\n1)E(t\n)\n+\n(1\n\u2212\nt\n)\nK(t\n)\nK(t\n)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c04\n\n(3.37)\n(2)\n\nis similar to but different from Q4 in eq.(3.30) due to the additional term \u01eb4 . The\ndifference is of course expected, otherwise the higher loop dilatation operator would\ncommute with a higher one-loop charge, i.e., integrability could be extended to higher\nloops without any deformation, which is certainly not the case.\nWith the dressed solution X(\u03b3) at hand we may ask for the corresponding values\nof the commuting charges, as we did for the trial solution X. Performing a perturbative (in \u03b3) computation of the spins Ji and the first few charges En on X(\u03b3), we\nfind that neither the spins nor the charges depend on the deformation parameter\n\u03b3; higher corrections Z (k) to the trial solution simply do not contribute. Another\nimportant point is that X(\u03b3) respects the Virasoro constraints. All this shows, in\nfact, that the dressed and the trial solutions differ in a very mild fashion. In the next\nsection we will use this observation to solve the B\u00e4cklund equations exactly and to\nfind all string commuting charges.\n3.4 Exact generating function of commuting charges in string theory\nHaving gained some experience from perturbative calculus we now want to determine\nan exact (to all orders in \u03b3) generating function for the commuting charges in string\ntheory. A direct approach to sum the series (3.13) seems hopeless due to increasing\n\n19\n\n\fcomplexity of the coefficients X (k) . Therefore we have to better understand the\nmeaning of the B\u00e4cklund transformations, and reformulate the problem in a suitable\nway.\nA first observation is that the B\u00e4cklund transformation \"almost\" preserves the\nNeumann form of the trial solution. An easy way to see this is to write the perturbative solution in terms of the complexified embedding coordinates Zi = X2i\u22121 + iX2i ,\ni = 1, 2, 3, where X1 , . . . , X6 are the original real variables of the O(6) sigma model.\nThen the first few coefficients of the dressed solution are (3.13)\nZi = xi eiwi \u03c4 ,\n2\n(1)\nZi = \u221a (\u2202\u03c3 + iwi )xi eiwi \u03c4 ,\nE2\n2\n(2)\nZi = (\u2202\u03c3 + iwi )2 xi eiwi \u03c4\nE2\n\n(3.38)\n\nand so on (the higher terms look more complicated). To get these formulae one\nuses the fact that E2 is an integral for both the sigma model (\u03c4 -independent) and\nfor the Neumann system (\u03c3-independent). Due to the phase exponents, eiwi \u03c4 , the\ndeformed solution is still of rotating type, but the \u03c3-dependent coefficients become\ncomplex, in contrast to the real variables xi of the trial solution. Thus, the B\u00e4cklund\ntransformation allows one to construct more general solutions of the O(6) model\nwhich correspond to the \"complexified\" Neumann ansatz:\nZi = ri (\u03c3, \u03b3) ei\u03b1i (\u03c3,\u03b3) eiwi \u03c4 ,\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere, in addition to the radial coordinates ri , the phase shifts \u03b1i come into play.\nAnother important observation comes from the analysis of the phase shifts \u03b1i\nfor the first few perturbative coefficients of the trial solution: The phases \u03b1i do not\ndepend on \u03c3, i.e. they are functions of the spectral parameter only. This fact implies\nthat the variables ri (\u03c3, \u03bb) solve the evolution equations of the Neumann system:\nri\u2032\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u2212wi2 ri\n\n\u2212 ri\n\n3\nX\n\n(rj\u20322 \u2212 wj2 rj2 ) .\n\n(3.40)\n\nj=1\n\nThus, ri (\u03c3, \u03b3) is a one-parameter family of solutions obeying the initial condition\nri (\u03c3, 0) = xi (\u03c3). On the other hand we already know all two-spin solutions8 of\nthe Neumann system corresponding to the folded and the circular strings [4]. They\nindeed form a one-parameter family, where the parameter is related to rigid shifts\nof the world-sheet variable \u03c3: \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 + const. Therefore we can immediately write\ndown the generic folded string solution depending on the spectral parameter:\n\u221a\nr1 (\u03b3) = dn(\u03bc + \u03bd, t) ,\nr2 (\u03b3) = t sn(\u03bc + \u03bd, t) ,\nr3 (\u03b3) = 0 ,\n(3.41)\n8\n\nThe B\u00e4cklund transformation preserves all the global charges of the O(6) model.\n\n20\n\n\fq\n\n2\n. The variable \u03bd is a yet\nwhere we introduced the concise notation \u03bc = \u03c3 w21\nunknown function of the spectral parameter \u03bd \u2261 \u03bd(\u03b3); however we know that it\ncannot depend on \u03c3. Requiring the solution to be periodic we obtain the usual\nperiodicity\ncondition for the folded string which we repeat here for convenience:\nq\n\u03c0\n2\nw21 = K(t) .\n2\nThus we considerably constrained the ansatz for the B\u00e4cklund solution: The\nonly unknowns left are the two phases \u03b11 , \u03b12 and the shift function \u03bd, all of which\ndepend solely on the spectral parameter \u03b3. Now we can use the B\u00e4cklund equations\n(3.11) to determine \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b3, and furthermore check the consistency of our ansatz.\nThe corresponding solution is found in appendix A and we use it to obtain the exact\ngenerating function for the commuting string charges. The final result reads\n3\n\nE(\u03b3) =\n\n4\u03b3\n\u03c0(1 + \u03b3 2 )\n\nq\n\n(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 tz)\n\u221a\n\u03a0(tz, t) ,\nz\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere the function z = sn2 \u03bd satisfies\nw12 z\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n1\u2212 2\n\u2212\nw21 1 \u2212 z\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n1\n= 0.\n1 \u2212 tz\n\n(3.43)\n\nThe last equation implies that z can be expanded in even powers of \u03b3, starting at\nO(\u03b3 2 ). Carefully developing the \u03b3-expansion of the elliptic integral \u03a0 and eliminating\nthe w's with the help of eqs.(3.24)\nw1 =\n\n1q 2 2\n\u03c0 E2 \u2212 4tK(t)2 ,\n\u03c0\n\nw2 =\n\n1q 2 2\n\u03c0 E2 \u2212 4(t \u2212 1)K(t)2 ,\n\u03c0\n\n(3.44)\n\none can check that the formula (3.42) correctly reproduces our previous findings for\nthe first few non-trivial charges E2 , E4 , E6 and so on. It also shows that all odd\ncharges are zero.\nTo complete the solution we recall that the energy E2 and the modulus t are\nfunctions of the spins determined by the following two equations:\nE2\nK(t)\n\n!2\n\nJ1\n\u2212\nE(t)\n\n!2\n\n4\n= 2t,\n\u03c0\n\nJ2\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\nJ1\n\u2212\nE(t)\n\n!2\n\n=\n\n4\n.\n\u03c02\n\n(3.45)\n\nThus, all string charges are implicit functions of the spins Ji .\nTo better appreciate the result obtained let us note that the function E(\u03b3) depends explicitly on the energy E2 . Given the energy E2 and the modulus t, all the\nhigher charges are uniquely determined by (3.42). From the point of view of the\nNeumann integrability this result is expected: the Neumann system has two integrals of motion which are essentially E2 and t. These integrals completely constrain\nthe solution (up to a constant shift in \u03c3), and we certainly do not need to use the\nhigher charges in order to derive the energy. All higher charges of the sigma model\n\n21\n\n\fembedding are then determined a posteriori. It is rather intriguing that this structure appears to differ significantly, on a conceptual level, from the one found on the\ngauge theory side. There all charges, generated by the transfer matrix operator, are\nrequired in order to apply the Bethe ansatz and obtain the solution of the spin chain\nenergy spectrum. The final results, when restricted to one-loop, nevertheless match\nprecisely.\nFinally let us also note that eqs.(3.44), (3.45) together with eq.(3.26) allows one\nto rewrite eq.(3.43) in the form\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1 \u2212 tz \uf8f0\nK(t0 ) \u2212 E(t0 )\n=\n1\u2212\n1\u2212z\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03c02 J 2\nz\uf8fb\n4 K(t0 )2\n\n(3.46)\n\nThis formula is most suitable for generating \u03b3- and J -expansions of z = z(\u03b3, J ) and,\nas the consequence, of E(\u03b3). Indeed, the second formula in (3.45) and eq.(3.26) can\nbe used to determine\nt4\nt2\n(3.47)\nt = t0 + 2 + 4 + ... ,\nJ\nJ\nwhere all the coefficients t2k , k > 0 are functions of t0 . Then all the coefficients in\nthe expansion of z appear to depend on t0 .\nThe derivation of the generating function for commuting charges related to the\ncircular string is very similar. The exact solution of the corresponding B\u00e4cklund\nequations is found in appendix A. Remarkably, the generating function for the circular string turns out to be of the identical form (3.42). The only difference lies in\nthe equation for the shift function \u03bd:\ntw12\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\nz\n+\n2\nw12\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n1 \u2212 tz\n\u2212 1 = 0,\n1\u2212z\n\nz = sn2 \u03bd .\n\n(3.48)\n\nThis formula is supplemented by the expressions for the w's via the energy and the\nmodulus\n1q 2 2\n1q 2 2\nw1 =\n\u03c0 E2 + 4(t \u2212 1)K(t)2 ,\nw2 =\n\u03c0 E2 \u2212 4K(t)2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nand by two transcendental equations yielding the energy and the modulus as functions of the spins\nE2\nK(t)\n\n!2\n\ntJ1\n\u2212\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\nJ1\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\n!2\n\n=\n\n4\n(1 \u2212 t) ,\n\u03c02\n\nJ2\n\u2212\n(1 \u2212 t)K(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\n(3.49)\n=\n\n4\n.\n\u03c02t\n\nThese expressions together with the formula relating the modulus t0 with the filling\nfraction \u03b1 for the circular string:\nJ2\n\u03b1=\n,\nJ\n\nE(t0 )\n1\n1\u2212\n\u03b1=1\u2212\nt0\nK(t0 )\n\n22\n\n!\n\n(3.50)\n\n\fallow one to cast the expression (3.48) in the form\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n\uf8ee\n\nt2\n1\u2212z \uf8f0\n1\u2212 2\n=\n1 \u2212 tz\nt0\n\nK(t0 ) \u2212 E(t0 )\nK(t) \u2212 E(t)\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03c02 J 2\nz\uf8fb .\n4 K(t0 )2\n\n(3.51)\n\nThe explicit \"perturbative\" matching of the first few charges generated by E(\u03b3) with\ntheir gauge theory counterparts is discussed in appendix A.\n\n4. Matching the entire infinite tower of commuting charges\nWe so far derived the exact generating functions of one-loop gauge charges, eq.(2.24)\nand eq.(2.39), as well as the exact generating functions of (unimproved) string\ncharges, eqs.(3.42),(3.45),(3.46) and eqs.(3.42),(3.49),(3.51), and we showed that\nthe first few charges indeed coincide if we (a) linearly redefine (improve) the string\ncharges, (b) restrict to one-loop and (c) apply a Gauss-Landen transformation. In\nthis final chapter we will apply this three-step procedure to the entire infinite tower\nof string charges. In other words, we will derive the infinite number of gauge charges\nfrom string theory. To be specific we will treat the case of the folded string first, and\nwork out the circular case in appendix A.2.\nThe idea is to implement the freedom of linear redefinition on a functional\nlevel. In particular, we are clearly allowed to replace \u03b3 2 by a new parameter \u03bc2\nwhich can be an arbitrary formal, even power series in \u03b3 2 such that \u03bc2 = \u03b3 2 +\nO(\u03b3 4 ). Ideally we would like to find an improved spectral parameter \u03bc such that\nthe transformed string resolvent eq.(3.42) only generates terms in the combination\n\u03bc2k J \u22122k+1 + O(\u03bc2k J \u22122k\u22121 ). The coefficient multiplying \u03bc2k would then correspond\nto the fully improved string charge. Inspection of eq.(3.46) shows that this can be\nalmost (see below) achieved by defining \u03bc through\n2\n\n1 \u2212 4\u03bc =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(4.1)\n\nEq.(3.46) becomes\ntz\nE(t0 )\n\u03bc2\n= 2 2+\n2\n2\n\u03c0 J\n4\u03c0 J\n4K(t0 )E(t)\n\n!2\n\nz(1 \u2212 tz)\n,\n1\u2212z\n\n(4.2)\n\nand we easily verify that the auxiliary parameter z now indeed expands in the improved fashion. Turning our attention to eq.(3.42), we see that we should drop an\noverall function in \u03bc which expands like 1 + O(\u03bc2 ), as it would again be a source\nof unwanted, low powers in 1/J at O(\u03bc2k ) (this is allowed since it once more corresponds to a linear redefinition). This way we find the following improved generating\nfunction\n4\u03bc3\n \u0303\nE(\u03b3) \u2192 E(\u03bc)\n=\n\u03c0\n\nq\n\n(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 tz)\n\u221a\n\u03a0(tz, t) .\nz\n\n23\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fwhich generates linearly redefined string charges\n \u0303\nE(\u03bc)\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u1ebc2k \u03bc2k\n\n(4.4)\n\nHowever, in the line preceding eq.(4.1) we wrote \"almost\" since, unfortunately, due\nto the overall power \u03bc3 in eq.(4.3), the redefined charges E \u03032k now expand as \u223c\n\u03bc2k J \u22122k+3 + O(\u03bc2k J \u22122k+1 ). This is much better as the old resolvent eq.(3.42), but\nin principle one further linear redefinition of the charges \u1ebc2k \u2192 E \u03042k is needed9 :\n2k \u2212 2\n\u01122k\u22122 .\nE \u03042k = E \u03032k + 4\n2k \u2212 3\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe E \u03042k are the properly scaling, fully improved string charges, requiring a further\n \u0303\n \u0304\nfunctional transform E(\u03bc)\n\u2192 E(\u03bc).\nHowever, we see from eq.(4.5) that to leading order in 1/J , the \"nearly-improved\" charges E \u03032k are proportional to the \"fullyimproved\" charges E \u03042k\u22122 ! We can therefore introduce a large-J generating function\n1 1 \u2212 \u03bc\u22122 \u1ebc(\u03bc)\nJ \u2192\u221e 2\nJ\n\nQ(u) = lim\n\nwith\n\nu2 = \u2212\n\n\u03bc2\n,\n\u03c02J 2\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere we deliberately use the same notation u as in chapter 2 since it will become\nclear in a moment that u can indeed be identified with the spectral parameter of\nthe gauge theory resolvent. Restriction to \"one-loop\" corresponds to keeping u finite\nand sending J to infinity. From eq.(4.3) the generating function in (4.6) becomes\nq\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 z)(t0 z \u2212 1)\n1h\n\u221a\nQ(u) = 1 \u2212 4u\n\u03a0(t0 z, t0 ) .\n2\nz\n\n(4.7)\n\nFurthermore, in this limit eq.(4.2) simplifies drastically and we get\nu2 +\n\n1\nz(1 \u2212 t0 z)\n= 0.\n2\n16K(t0 )\n1\u2212z\n\n(4.8)\n\nWe pick up the root which in the vicinity of u \u223c 0 behaves as z \u223c u2 , namely\nz=\n\n1 \u2212 16K(t0 )2 u2\n2t0\n\n\uf8eb\n\nv\nu\nu\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec1 \u2212 u1 + \u0010\nt\n\uf8ed\n\n64t0 K(t0 )2 u2\n1 \u2212 16K(t0 )2 u2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\u00112 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThe final step consists in applying the Gauss-Landen transformation (3.33) to eq.(4.7).\nIn particular, one can prove that the following modular transformation formula is\nvalid\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ns\n\u221a\n2\n2\n\u0011\n2 \u2212 u2 \u0010\nb\na\nu\n1\n2 ab\n\uf8f0 +\n\u03a0 \u2212q 2\n, q \uf8fb .

Exact solution of the B\u00e4cklund equations and generating\nfunction\nUsing the ansatz (3.39) for the B\u00e4cklund solution we write down the generating\nfunction (3.15)\nE(\u03b3) = \u03b3\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nh\ni\nd\u03c3\nri (\u03b3) (1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 ) cos \u03b1i x\u2032i + (1 + \u03b3 2 )wi sin \u03b1i xi )\n4\u03c0\n\n(A.1)\n\nHere ri (\u03b3) is the B\u00e4cklund solution (3.41) and xi is the trial solution: xi = ri (0). As\nwas discussed in the main text, to compute E(\u03b3) one has to find the phases \u03b1i (\u03b3)\nand the shift function \u03bd(\u03b3).\nA.1 Folded case\nWe start with the folded string described by eqs.(3.4); the spectral dependent solution\nri (\u03b3) is given by (3.41). Consider the normalization condition (3.12)\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\ncos \u03b11 r1 (\u03b3)x1 + cos \u03b12 r2 (\u03b3)x2 =\n.\n1 + \u03b32\n\n25\n\n(A.2)\n\n\fSpecifying \u03c3 = 0 or \u03c3 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\ncos \u03b11 =\n\none finds\n1 \u2212 \u03b32 1\n,\n1 + \u03b3 2 dn\u03bd\n\ncos \u03b12 =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 cn\u03bd\n.\n1 + \u03b3 2 dn\u03bd\n\n(A.3)\n\nPlugging the found solution back into eq.(A.2) we obtain the following relation\ndn(\u03bc + \u03bd) dn \u03bd + t cn \u03bc sn \u03bc sn(\u03bc + \u03bd) = dn \u03bd ,\n\nq\n\n2\n\u03bc \u2261 \u03c3 w21\n\nwhich must hold for any value of \u03c3. This is indeed the case as one can verify by\nusing the addition formulas for elliptic functions.\nIt is convenient to separate the real and the imaginary parts of the B\u00e4cklund\nequations. Then one can show that with the choice (A.3) the real part of eqs.(3.11)\nis identically satisfied while the imaginary part implies the relations\nw1 sn \u03bd\nw2\nsin \u03b11 = q\nsn \u03bd .\n(A.4)\n,\nsin \u03b12 = q\nw 2 cn \u03bd\nw2\n21\n\n21\n\nNow the identity cos2 \u03b11 + sin2 \u03b11 = 1 gives an equation for the unknown function \u03bd:\nw12 sn2 \u03bd\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n+\n2\nw21\ncn2 \u03bd\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n1\n=1\ndn2 \u03bd\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhich is equivalent to eq.(3.43).\nFinally using eqs.(A.3) and (A.4) one can prove that the \u03c3-dependence of the\neqs.(3.11) is identically satisfied due to elliptic function identities. This shows consistency of our ansatz for the B\u00e4cklund solution. Thus we have found the exact solution\nof the B\u00e4cklund equations.\nIt is worth stressing that the B\u00e4cklund solution we found has the same dual CFT\noperator as the trial solution. Indeed, the phases in eq.(3.39), which are independent\nof \u03c4 and \u03c3, can be gauged away by the rigid U(1)\u00d7U(1)\u00d7U(1) rotation, while the\nfunction \u03bd(\u03b3) can be removed by the constant shift of \u03c3 (the leftover reparametrization invariance). However, the B\u00e4cklund equations themselves are not invariant w.r.t.\nthese symmetries and that is why they lead to a particular solution with non-trivial\n\u03b3-dependence.\nTo obtain the the generating function the following integration formulae are\nhelpful\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c3\nr1 (\u03bb)r1 (0)\n4\u03c0\nd\u03c3\nr2 (\u03bb)r2 (0)\n4\u03c0\nd\u03c3\nr1 (\u03bb)r1\u2032 (0)\n4\u03c0\nd\u03c3\nr2 (\u03bb)r2\u2032 (0)\n4\u03c0\n\nh\ni\ndn \u03bd\n2\n2\nK(t)\n\u2212\ncn\n\u03bd\u03a0(t\nsn\n\u03bd,\nt)\n,\n2K(t) sn2 \u03bd\ni\ncn \u03bd dn \u03bd h\n2\n\u03a0(t\nsn\n\u03bd,\nt)\n\u2212\nK(t)\n,\n=\n2K(t) sn2 \u03bd\ni\ncn \u03bd h 2\n2\n2\ndn\n\u03bd(K(t)\n\u2212\n\u03a0(t\nsn\n\u03bd,\nt))\n+\nsn\n\u03bd(K(t)\n\u2212\nE(t))\n,\n=\n\u03c0 sn3 \u03bd\ni\n1 h 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nsn\n\u03bdE(t)\n\u2212\ndn\n\u03bdK(t)\n+\ncn\n\u03bd\ndn\n\u03bd\u03a0(t\nsn\n\u03bd,\nt)\n.\n=\n\u03c0 sn3 \u03bd\n\n=\n\n26\n\n\fThey can be easily derived by using the addition formulae for elliptic functions and\nthe integral representation for the complete elliptic integral of the third kind \u03a0(u, t).\nUsing these formulae we obtain\n\u0014\n\ni\n\u03b3\ncn \u03bd h\n2\n2 2\n2\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n)\nK(t)\n\u2212\ndn\n\u03bd\u03a0(t\nsn\n\u03bd,\nt)\n(A.6)\nE(\u03b3) =\n\u03c0(1 + \u03b3 2 )\nsn \u03bd dn \u03bd\n!\n#\nh\ni\ndn \u03bd\nw22 cn \u03bd\nw12\n2 2 dn \u03bd cn \u03bd\n2\n+ (1 + \u03b3 )\n\u03a0(t sn \u03bd, t) \u2212\nK(t) ,\n\u2212 2\n2\nsn \u03bd\nw21\nw21 cn \u03bd sn \u03bd\n2\n2\nThe last step consists in expressing the quantities w12 /w21\nand w22 /w21\nfrom eq.(A.5)\n\nw12\ncn2 \u03bd\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n=\n\u2212\n2\nw21\nsn2 \u03bd\n1 + \u03b32\nw22\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\n=\n\u2212\n2\nw21\nsn2 \u03bd\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n!2\n\ncn2 \u03bd\n,\nsn2 \u03bd dn2 \u03bd\n\n(A.7)\n\ncn2 \u03bd\nsn2 \u03bd dn2 \u03bd\n\n(A.8)\n\nand substituting them into eq.(A.6).

The\npresentation will be more succinct as the one above.\nOne starts with the following ansatz for the B\u00e4cklund solution\nr1 (\u03b3) = sn(\u03bc + \u03bd),\n\nr2 (\u03b3) = cn(\u03bc + \u03bd),\n\nr3 (\u03b3) = 0 with \u03bc = \u03c3\n\ns\n\n2\nw12\n. (A.9)\nt\n\nThen the following formulae solve the B\u00e4cklund equations for the circular string:\n1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 dn \u03bd\n,\n1 + \u03b3 2 cn \u03bd\n\u221a\nt w1\nsn \u03bd ,\nsin \u03b11 = q\n2\nw12\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b32 1\n,\n1 + \u03b3 2 cn \u03bd\n\u221a\nt w2 sn \u03bd\nsin \u03b12 = q\n.\nw 2 dn \u03bd\n\ncos \u03b11 =\n\ncos \u03b12 =\n\n(A.10)\n(A.11)\n\n12\n\nThe equation for the shift function \u03bd is\n\ntw12 2\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\nsn\n\u03bd\n+\n2\nw12\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\ndn2 \u03bd\n= 1,\ncn2 \u03bd\n\n(A.12)\n\nwhich can be written as\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\ntw12\nz\n+\n2\nw12\n1 + \u03b32\n\n!2\n\n1 \u2212 tz\n\u2212 1 = 0,\n1\u2212z\n\nz = sn2 \u03bd .\n\n(A.13)\n\nw1 > w2\n\n(A.14)\n\nThe frequencies wi are found from the equations [4]\n2\n\u03c0 2 w12\n= K(t)2 ,\n4 t\n\nE22 = w22 +\n\n27\n\n2\nw12\n,\nt\n\n\fand they are\nw1 =\n\n1q 2 2\n\u03c0 E2 + 4(t \u2212 1)K(t)2 ,\n\u03c0\n\nw2 =\n\n1q 2 2\n\u03c0 E2 \u2212 4K(t)2 .\n\u03c0\n\nThe exact generating function is\nE(\u03b3) =\n\nh\nh\ni\n\u03b3\n2 2 dn \u03bd\n2\n2\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n)\nK(t)\n\u2212\ncn\n\u03bd\u03a0(t\nsn\n\u03bd)\n(A.15)\n\u03c0(1 + \u03b3 2 )\nsn \u03bd cn \u03bd\n!\nh\ni\nw22\ncn \u03bd\nw12 dn \u03bd\n2 2 cn \u03bd dn \u03bd\n2\n+(1 + \u03b3 )\n\u03a0(t sn \u03bd, t) \u2212\n\u2212\nK(t)\n.\n2\n2\nsn \u03bd\nw12\nw12\ndn \u03bd sn \u03bd\n\nAgain, excluding the w's with the help of eq.(A.12) for the shift function \u03bd we can\nsimplify the expression (A.15) to get\nE(\u03b3) =\n\n4\u03b3 3\ncn \u03bd dn \u03bd\n\u03a0(t sn2 \u03bd, t) .\n2\n\u03c0(1 + \u03b3 ) sn \u03bd\n\n(A.16)\n\nQuite remarkably, the generation function for the circular string turns out to be\nexactly of the same form as as the one of the folded string. The difference lies of\ncourse in the equation for the shift function.\nAs in the folded string case all odd charges vanish for the circular string configuration. From eq.(A.16) it is easy to obtain the explicit expressions for the charges,\ne.g. the first two non-trivial charges E4 and E6 are\n32\n16\nE(t)K(t)\n\u2212\n(t \u2212 1)K(t)4 ,\n\u03c0 2 E2\n\u03c0 4 E23\nh\ni\n25\n26\nE6 = 2 E(t)K(t) + 4 3 K(t)3 4(t \u2212 2)E(t) + 7(t \u2212 1)K(t)\n\u03c0 E2\n3\u03c0 E2\n9\nh\ni\n2\n5 * 29\n\u2212 6 5 (t \u2212 1)K(t)5 E(t) \u2212 (t \u2212 2)K(t) \u2212 8 7 (t \u2212 1)2 K(t)8 .\n\u03c0 E2\n\u03c0 E2\n\nE4 = \u2212\n\n(A.17)\n\n(A.18)\n\nFor the same reason as for the folded string the higher charges En evaluated on\nthe circular type solution need to be improved in order to scale homogeneously. It\nturns out that the corresponding redefined charges are given by the same formulae\n(3.29) and (3.31). This is not surprising since a universal relation between the string\nand the gauge theory models implies that the charge redefinition must be universal as\nwell, i.e., it should be independent of particular solutions of the evolution equations.\nString theory provides the following values for the improved charges at one loop:\n2\nK(t0 )E(t0 ) ,\n\u03c02\nh\ni\n16\nQ4 = \u2212 4 K(t0 )3 (t0 \u2212 2)E(t0 ) + (t0 \u2212 1)K(t0 ) ,\n\u03c0\nh\ni\n29\n5\n2\n2\nK(t\n)\n(6\n\u2212\n6t\n+\nt\n)E(t\n)\n+\n2(2\n\u2212\n3t\n+\nt\n)K(t\n)\nQ6 =\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 ,\n0\n0\n3\u03c0 6\nQ2 =\n\n28\n\n(A.19)\n\n\fh\ni\n211\n7\n2\n2\nK(t\n)\n(2\n\u2212\nt\n)(10\n\u2212\n10t\n+\nt\n)E(t\n)\n\u2212\n3(t\n\u2212\n1)(5\n\u2212\n5t\n+\nt\n)K(t\n)\n,\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c08\nh\n217\nK(t0 )9 (70 \u2212 140t0 + 90t20 \u2212 20t30 + t40 )E(t0 )\n=\n10\n5\u03c0\ni\n+ 4(14 \u2212 35t0 + 30t20 \u2212 10t30 + t40 )K(t0 )\n\nQ8 =\nQ10\n..\n.\n\nand so on. The string charge Q2 and the gauge charge Q2 in eq.(2.32)) are related\nby the following Gauss-Landen transformation\n\u221a\n4 r\n\u221a\nt0 = \u2212\n.\n(A.20)\n(1 \u2212 r)2\nThis results in\nK(t0 ) = (1 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\nE(t0 ) = 2(1 \u2212\n\nr)K(r),\n\n\u221a\n\nr)\u22121 E(r) \u2212 (1 +\n\n\u221a\n\nr)K(r)\n\n(A.21)\n\nThe same transformation applies to all higher charges. It is easy to check that under\nthis transformation the string charges again (A.19) nicely turn into the gauge charges\n(2.32),(2.40), up to a multiplicative constant:\n1\n3\n5\nQ\n,\nQ\n=\n\u2212\nQ\n,\nQ\n=\n\u2212\nQ6 ,\n2\n4\n4\n6\n4\u03c0 2\n8\u03c0 4\n12\u03c0 6\n9\n7\nQ\n,\nQ\n=\n\u2212\nQ10 , . . . .\nQ8 = \u2212\n8\n10\n16\u03c0 8\n20\u03c0 10\n\nQ2 = \u2212\n\n(A.22)\n\nThe general formula is\nQ2k = \u2212\n\n2k \u2212 1\nQ2k .\n4k\u03c0 2k\n\n(A.23)\n\nUp to the factor (\u22121)k+1 (see the comment after eq. (2.37)) this formula coincides\nwith eq.(3.36).\nFinally, the proof of the exact matching of the gauge and the \"one-loop\" string\nspectral curves for the circular string configuration proceeds in analogy to the treatment in chapter 4. Let us briefly sketch the main steps. Introducing the improved\nspectral parameter\nx2 =\n\n\u03bc2\n,\n\u03c02J 2\n\n(A.24)\n\nwhere \u03bc is defined through eq.(4.1), we find from eq.(3.51) the following relation in\nthe large J limit:\nx2 \u2212\n\nz(1 \u2212 z)\n1\n= 0.\n16K(t0 )2 1 \u2212 t0 z\n\n29\n\n(A.25)\n\n\fThe large J circular string spectral curve is then found from eq.(3.42) to be\nQ(x) =\n\n1h\n\n2\n\n1 \u2212 4x\n\nq\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 t0 z)\n\u221a\n\u03a0(t0 z, t0 ) .\nz\n\n(A.26)\n\nThe slight difference with eq.(4.7) is due to our sign convention for the charges (once\nagain see the comment after eq. (2.37)). The Gauss-Landen transformation (A.20)\nis applied by using the transformation rule (x \u2264 c < d)\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u0010 x2 \u0011\n1 1q 2\nq\n(c \u2212 x2 )(d2 \u2212 x2 )\u03a0 2 , r ,\n\u03a0(t0 z, t0 ) =\n+\nd\ncd + x2 + (c2 \u2212 x2 )(d2 \u2212 x2 ) 8 d\n\nd\u2212c\n\nwhere c and d are given by eqs.(2.30). The result we find is\nQ(x) = H(x) \u2212\n\n\u03b1\n,\n2\n\n(A.27)\n\nwhere H(x) is precisely the circular gauge theory spectral curve in eq.(2.39), q.e.d.\nA.3 The Gauss-Landen transformation\nIt is of interest to recall the geometric meaning of the Gauss-Landen transformation\nand to understand what it means in our present context. The Jacobi modulus t\ncompletely defines an elliptic curve y 2 = (1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 tx2 ), in particular, its complex\nstructure \u03c4 which is the ratio of the primitive periods \u03c91 and \u03c92 : \u03c4 = \u03c9\u03c921 . The curve\ncan be uniformized by the function sn, i.e. y = sn\u2032 z, x = sn z, which has the periods\n\u03c91 = 4K(t) and \u03c92 = 2iK(1 \u2212 t). Thus, the complex structure is\n\u03c4=\n\ni K(1 \u2212 t)\n\u03c92\n=\n.\n\u03c91\n2 K(t)\n\n(A.28)\n\nFor the string curve defining the circular string solution in the one-loop approximation the complex structure \u03c4s is therefore\n\u03c4s =\n\ni K(1 \u2212 t0 )\n.\n2 K(t0 )\n\n(A.29)\n\nTaking into account eqs.(A.21) and the transformation rule\n\u221a\n1\nK(1 \u2212 t0 ) = (1 \u2212 r)K(1 \u2212 r)\n2\n\n(A.30)\n\nwe perform the Gauss-Landen transformation (A.20) on \u03c4s :\n\u03c4s =\n\ni K(1 \u2212 r)\n1\ni K(1 \u2212 t0 )\n=\n= \u03c4g ,\n2 K(t0 )\n4 K(r)\n2\n\n(A.31)\n\nwhere \u03c4g appears to be the complex structure of the elliptic curve governing the\nposition of the Bethe roots on the gauge theory side. We therefore realize that the\n\n30\n\n\fgauge curve10 defining the Bethe root distribution and the string curve which solves\nthe string evolution equations are related in a simple way: the former is a doublecover of the latter. A similar interpretation might be given for the folded string\nsolution.\nThe potential importance of our observation about the interrelation between the\nstring and the gauge curves is that the covering index (two in our case) is an integer\nand, therefore, it might be stable to loop deformations, i.e. it could survive even if the\nhigher loops are concerned. This would mean that the Gauss-Landen transformation\nis universal and it could be extended to higher loops as well.\n\nB. Conventions for elliptic integrals and elliptic functions\nFor the benefit of the serious reader we are collecting our conventions for various\nelliptic integrals and functions.\nThe complete elliptic integrals of the first (K) and second (E) kind are\nK(q) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nq\n\nd\u03c6\n\nE(q) \u2261\n\n2\n\n1 \u2212 q sin \u03c6\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2\n0\n\nd\u03c6\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 q sin2 \u03c6.\n\n(B.1)\n\nand the complete elliptic integral of the third kind is\n\u03a0(m2 , q) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nq\n\n(1 \u2212 m2 sin2 \u03c6) 1 \u2212 q sin2 \u03c6\n\n0\n\n.\n\n(B.2)\n\nTo derive the string spectral curve the following integral representation for \u03a0(m2 , q)\nwas used\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nd\u03c3\n2\u03c0\n=\n\u03a0(m2 , q) .\n2\nK(q)\n1 \u2212 m2 sn2 ( \u03c0 K(q)\u03c3, q)\n\n(B.3)\n\nThe Jacobi elliptic function sn \u03bd \u2261 sn(\u03bd, q) inverts the elliptic integral of the first\nkind:\n\u03bd=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ndx\n\nsn \u03bd\n\nq\n\n(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 qx2 )\n\n.\n\n(B.4)\n\nThe elliptic functions cn \u03bd \u2261 cn(\u03bd, q) and dn \u03bd \u2261 dn(\u03bd, q) are related to sn \u03bd through\nthe identities:\nsn2 \u03bd + cn2 \u03bd = 1 ,\n\ndn2 \u03bd + q sn2 \u03bd = 1 .\n\n10\n\n(B.5)\n\nThe curves we discussed here should not be confused with the spectral curves, the latter depend\non the additional spectral parameter and generate the infinite family of commuting charges.\n\n31\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S.
