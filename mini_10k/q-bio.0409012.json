In this paper we show how one can robustly\nand effectively perform practical computations using small perturbations to a very simple globally\ncoupled network of coupled oscillators. Computations are performed by exploiting the spatiotemporal dynamics of a robust attracting heteroclinic network (also referred to as 'winnerless\ncompetition' dynamics). We use different cluster synchronization states to encode memory states\nand use this to design a simple multi-base counter. The simulations indicate that this gives a\nrobust computational system exploiting the natural dynamics of the system.\nPACS numbers: 05.45, 87.10.+e\n\n1\n\n\fRecent experimental and theoretical work by several authors has highlighted the crucial\nrole of spatio-temporal dynamics in neural systems. In particular, work on olfactory systems\nof insects and fish has demonstrated that recognized odors manifest themselves as different\nspatio-temporal outputs from certain sub-systems such as [1, 2, 3, 4] for insect antennal\nlobes (AL) and [5, 6] for the Zebrafish olfactory bulb (OB). It has been suggested that the\ndynamics of the network responsible for the transformation of input to output of the AL/OB\nfor these systems is one of 'winnerless competition' [7, 8, 9]; this is a class of attracting\ndynamics consisting of saddle periodic orbits linked together by unstable manifolds. Such\nattractors may seem at first unnatural but in systems that are close to symmetric and in\nsystems that have invariant subspaces they may be robust; i.e. they may persist under\narbitrary perturbations that preserve the symmetric (or invariant subspace) structure. Such\nattractors have been found in a range of physically relevant models and experiments [10, 11].\nThe AL/OB system is far from being a simple relay; it shows effects such as short term\nmemory, anticipation and computation [7]. The aim of this paper is to show that globally\ncoupled systems idealizing the AL/OB architecture can be used to explicitly design computational systems by exploiting robust heteroclinic attractors (winnerless competition). We\nuse globally coupled phase oscillators in regimes where one finds slow switching between\ncluster states [12, 13, 14, 15]. Previous work has shown [16] that robust heteroclinic attractors for a particular system of five globally coupled phase oscillators allow one to encode\nup to twenty different memory states as synchronized clusters, and moreover to effectively\nmove between them by means of small perturbations. The number of such states scales\nexponentially with N the number of oscillators. In this paper we go further to show that\none can in principle perform arbitrary computations using a globally coupled cluster for\n'memory/timing' on addition of perturbations that may have very low amplitude.\nWe consider perturbations to the model of Hansel et al. [12] for N globally coupled\noscillators with phases \u03b8i \u2208 T = [0, 2\u03c0) given by\nN\n1 X\n \u0307\ng (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) + \u03b7wi (t) + \u01ebIi (t),\n\u03b8i = \u03c9 +\nN j=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhen i = 1, * * * , N and g(\u03c6) = \u2212 sin(\u03c6 + \u03b1) + r sin(2\u03c6); see also [13, 14, 15]. The quantities\nwi (t) represent derivatives of independent, identically distributed Brownian processes with\nzero mean and unit variance per unit time. The inputs |Ii (t)| \u2264 1 are used to control the\nstate of the system. We include \u03b7 and \u01eb, small parameters that control the strength of the\n2\n\n\fnoise and perturbations respectively.\nThe system (1) for the unperturbed system (\u03b7 = \u01eb = 0) has symmetry SN corresponding to permutations of the N oscillators. Using these symmetries one can identify robust\nheteroclinic attractors (first noted theoretically in [11] and then practically for this example\nin [12]) that exist for open sets of parameters. For certain parameter values the attractors\nconsist of saddle periodic orbits of symmetry Sk \u00d7 SN \u2212k , i.e. states where all oscillators are\nin one of two possible phases at any point in time and such that precisely k of them are in\none phase. The system also has an S1 phase-shift symmetry that allows one to characterize\nperiodic orbits as group orbits. For\nN = 5, \u03b1 = 1.25, \u03c9 = 5, r = 0.25,\n\n(2)\n\nthe only attractor for unperturbed (1) consists of twenty periodic orbits with symmetry\nS2 \u00d7 S3 and their unstable invariant manifolds. This forms them into a single strongly\nconnected network.\nThe periodic orbits involved are S1 orbits of xj = (0, 0, 0, \u03c8j , \u03c8j ) with j = 1, 2 and\npermutations thereof. We list a set of permutations \u03c3k with k = 1, * * * , 10 that map the\nperiodic orbit through xj onto the 10 possible symmetric images and denote by Pjk the\n\nperiodic orbit given by the S1 orbit of \u03c3k xj for j = 1, 2 and k = 1, * * * , 10. These periodic\norbits are listed in Table I. For the given parameters (2), \u03c81 = 1.339 and \u03c82 = 0.799 [16].\nS S2\nu\nk\nu\nIf we write \u03a3 = 10\nj=1 W (Pj ) where W (P ) is the unstable manifold of the saddle\ni=1\nperiodic orbit P then any randomly chosen initial condition approaches \u03a3; this manifests\nitself as a sequence of 'slowing down' switchings between different cluster states Pjk . Figure 1\nshows a detail of the unstable manifold of one of the P1k .\nFor larger N (1) displays heteroclinic cycles between Sk \u00d7 SN \u2212k symmetry states for a\nvariety of k with N/3 < k \u2264 N/2 [14]; this gives rise to more complicated attracting heteroclinic networks that are currently under investigation by the authors. The unperturbed\ndynamics is such that after a transient period the system state is near one of the Pjk except\nfor increasingly occasional short transitions. As \u03a3 is asymptotically stable this is also true\neven for the perturbed system as long as the perturbation in small enough. We exploit this\nfeature for our computational system. Typical initial conditions for the unperturbed system\nlead to an asymptotic state that is a slowing-down oscillation between P1k and P2k for some\nk determined by the initial condition.\n3\n\n\fTrajectories of the perturbed system may visit many or all Pjk where j always alternates\nbetween 1 and 2 and k changes on a longer timescale [16]. This is because the unstable\nmanifold of P1k is two dimensional and only exceptional trajectories on this connect to P2l\nwith k 6= l. In the presence of noise we refer to the average time of switching between\n\nPjk as the cycling time Tc ; one can show that this scales as \u2212 ln \u03b7 [12]. The average time\n\nof switching between Pjk with different k we refer to as the switching time Ts . The order\nPN i\u03b8\nk\noften considered for such systems [12, 14] oscillates at a rate\nparameter \u03c7 = N1\nk=1 e\ngiven by the cycling time. Because this measure is invariant under permutations of the\nphases it is not possible to detect switches and compute Ts using only \u03c7.\nOne can view the globally coupled system (1) as a computational system with five inputs\nP\nIi (t), i = 1..5 and twenty outputs Yjk (\u03b8) = |\u03b8 \u2212 Pjk |1 (where |\u03b8|1 = i |\u03b8i |), namely if Yjk\n\nis small then the trajectory is close to Pjk . Figure 2 shows the statistics of \u03b4, the local\n\nminimum of the Yjk over one cycle. The mean h\u03b4i varies proportionally as the square root\nof the noise, reminiscent of the algebraic scaling in heteroclinic switching rates with noise\nlevel found in [17]. Defining the mean probability of switching per cycle Ps , we can estimate\nPs = Tc /Ts . Numerical simulations indicate that Ts /Tc = O(\u03b7 1/2) as \u03b7 \u2192 0; see Figure 3,\n\u221a\nwhere we detect close approaches by |\u03b8 \u2212 Pjk |1 < \u2206 where \u2206 = 10 \u01eb. This ensures that\nall the switches found in Figure 2 are registered while it avoids false positive detections of\nswitching, as (for instance) may occur on a trajectories moving between P11 and P21 passing\nvery close to P29 or P22 (see Figure (1)). One can then use simple logic gates to connect up\noutputs and inputs to form a computational system.\nAs a proof-of-principal, we have used (1) to construct a counter that counts in either base\n5 or base 2 depending on initial condition to the phases. The inputs we consider are C(t) a\nclock pulse that occurs at approximately regular intervals and X(t) an input that may or may\nnot occur between clock pulses. We construct the system so that pulses of C(t) occurring\nat a state P2k perturb the system along the unstable manifold towards P1k and pulses of\nl(k)\n\nX(t) occurring at a state P1k perturb the system along the unstable manifold towards P1\n\nwhere l = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 7, 9, 10]. In each case this corresponds to simply applying a pulse\nto input Ip(k) where p = [4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]. In this way we effectively define functions\nIi = F1 (Yjk )X + F2 (Yjk )C that steer the state of the system around the network rapidly and\nreliably even when \u01eb is very small, depending on the inputs X and C. We show the setup\nschematically in Figure 4; Figure 5 shows the counter functioning accurately for an initial\n4\n\n\fcondition near P12 . Figure 6 shows simulations on changing parameters and in the last case,\ninitial conditions.\nThere is a trade-off between on the one hand the speed of computation and on the other\nhand its accuracy and sensitivity to noise. In particular the input amplitude \u01eb gives a\ncharacteristic cycle time as does the noise amplitude \u03b7. For effective computation in the\nabove system we need 1 \u226b \u01eb \u226b \u03b7 and the clock cycles must lie between the cycle times\nassociated to the two perturbation amplitudes.\nMany models use oscillators to perform computational tasks, for example [19]. The\nnovelty in this work is that we demonstrate how one of the simplest possible types of coupling\ncan give rise to robust attracting heteroclinic networks that one can exploit to perform\ncomputations. As in winnerless competition models [1, 8, 9] the average phase differences in\nthe globally coupled system change very little depending on the state of the system and the\ncomputation is performed by following natural trajectories within the system. Moreover, the\nstate of the system is not detectable from individual or 'mean' cell outputs but is encoded\nglobally. By contrast, if we use asymptotically stable attractors for storing memory states\ncomparatively large perturbations to the system will be needed to lift it out of the basin of\nattraction into another state.\nThe mechanism we consider is a winnerless competition model using (a) two dimensional\nmanifolds which allow many possibilities to be considered at each state and so allows the\nnetwork to scale to large numbers of states without greatly increasing the average length of\npath (b) the dynamics requires no careful tuning for a range of coupling parameters, nor\nplasticity in the coupling. We use two populations of processing elements (a) the globally\ncoupled oscillators \u03b8i have the function of a 'memory/timing' circuit and (b) observables Yjk\nfrom the system that detect presence of a particular cluster state. The latter are analogous\nto certain Kenyon Cells in the mushroom body that receive inputs from an insect antennal\nlobe [3, 4, 7, 18] and decode a large dense set of states in a relatively low dimensional space\nto a sparse set of states in a higher dimensional space.\nWe believe that the simple global coupling used within the 'processing element' of our\nmodel is a positive feature. Although symmetry is never achieved, the observation that the\nheteroclinic attractor is asymptotically stable means that the dynamics are well modelled\neven when global coupling is perturbed. There may be evolutionary advantages to having\nneural subsystems that attempt to approach symmetric coupling as this can presumably\n5\n\n\fbe encoded genetically very simply (see [20] for other approaches to neural information\nprocessing that use symmetries). The fact that the dynamics of the unperturbed system is\nrobust means that heteroclinic attractors are model-independent and will exist in globally\ncoupled systems of phase oscillators [11, 21], coupled ODE oscillators or even piecewise\nsmooth systems of phase-resetting oscillators [22].\nThe dynamics we use is not present in N \u2264 4 oscillators; to find robust heteroclinic\nattractors with unstable manifolds of higher than one dimension we need N \u2265 5 [16]. The\nideas presented should scale well on increasing N beyond 5; the number of cluster states\ngrows exponentially but the diameter of the heteroclinic network need not grow, meaning\nthat rapid transition from one state to another is still possible. Note we do not claim that\nany particular AL/OB neural system functions via perturbations to a robust heteroclinic\nattractor (though this has been suggested [1]). We do show that a globally coupled system\nof phase oscillators allows rapid and reliable computation.\nAcknowledgments: We acknowledge very interesting discussions with Roman Borisyuk,\nDavid Corne, Gerhard Dangelmayr and Marc Timme concerning this research.
