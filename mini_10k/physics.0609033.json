Introduction\nThe notion of light containing orbital and spin components of angular momentum has become of\ninterest in recent years and a direct decomposition into the two components has been found for\nparaxial rays [1-4]. However, a simple, plausible and general derivation of the components from\nthe expression for the angular momentum J(t) of the classical electromagnetic field in terms of\nthe electric E(x,t) and magnetic field B(x,t)\nJ(t) =\n\n1\nd 3 x x \u00d7 [E(x,t) \u00d7 B(x,t)]\n\u222b\n4\u03c0c\n\n(1)\n\n(Gaussian units, bold font denotes a three-vector) seems to be lacking. Some authors [5, 6], used\ndecompositions that were not manifestly gauge invariant. Other decompositions lack generality\n[2, 3, 7]. In this paper, by applying the vector decomposition theorem of Helmholtz to the electric\nfield, we obtain a decomposition of the angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field\ninto orbital and spin components that is explicit, quite general and manifestly gauge invariant\nthroughout because it involves the fields only and not the potentials.\n\n2. Helmholtz decompositions\nThe vector decomposition theorem of Helmholtz [8-11] states that any 3-vector field E(x) that\nvanishes at spatial infinity can be expressed uniquely as the sum of two terms\nE(x,t) = -\u2207 x f (x,t) + \u2207 x \u00d7 F(x,t)\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2207 x is the gradient operator with respect to x and the scalar f and vector F potential\nfunctions are\nf (x,t) = \u222b d3 y\n\n\u2207 y .E(y,t)\n4\u03c0 | x \u2212 y |\n\nand\n\nF(x,t) = \u222b d 3 y\n\n\u2207 y \u00d7 E(y,t)\n4\u03c0 | x \u2212 y |\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThe first term of (2) is called the longitudinal part, the second the transverse part. Some authors\nhave questioned if the Helmholtz theorem applies to fields that vary with time and it has been\nconfirmed elsewhere [10-12] that it does. If the field is the electromagnetic E field then, after\nusing Maxwell equations, the two potential functions in (2) become\nArXiv\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\fAIR Congress 2005\n\nA.M.Stewart\n\nf (x,t) = \u222b d y\n3\n\n(y,t)\nB(y,t)\n3\nF(x,t) = \u2212 \u222b d y\nand\n| x\u2212 y |\nt\n4\u03c0c | x \u2212 y |\n\n(4)\n\nwhere (x,t) is the electric charge density and B the magnetic Maxwell field. We see that the\nHelmholtz theorem decomposes the Maxwell electric field into gradients of the electromagnetic\nCoulomb gauge potentials E = -\u2207f \u2212 At / ct . The expression for Coulomb gauge\nelectromagnetic vector potential At,\nAt (x,t) = \u2207 x \u00d7 \u222b d3 y\n\nB(y,t)\n4\u03c0 | x \u2212 y |\n\n(5)\n\nwas obtained previously [10, 11] by making a Helmholtz decomposition of the general\nelectromagnetic vector potential. The term At is the irreducible part of the vector potential that\nencodes all the information about the magnetic field [11]. The pure gauge term of the vector\npotential, which is the gradient of a scalar field, does not encode any physical information. When\nthe electromagnetic E field is decomposed in this way one part of it, that involving the gradient in\nequation (2), is necessarily associated with the presence of electric charge (bound or b) and one\npart, that involving the curl in equation (2) (free or f), is not necessarily associated with the\npresence of electric charge. In this sense, the fields in an irregularly shaped metal cavity will be\nsaid to be free although they do not have the form of plane waves. The categorisation applies to\nany physical quantities that depend on E, such as the angular momentum.\nAs well, the electromagnetic B field may be decomposed by means of the Helmholtz\ntheorem. Because \u2207.B = 0, there is only one term in the decomposition and, with the use of the\ninhomogeneous Maxwell equation\n\u2207\u00d7B=\n\n4\u03c0\n1 E\nj+\nc t\nc\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere j is the electric current density, we get\nB(x,t) = \u2212\n\n1 3\n1\n1\nE(y,t)\n1\nd y j (y,t) \u00d7 \u2207 x\n\u2212\nd3 y\n\u00d7 \u2207x\n\u222b\n\u222b\nc\n| x \u2212 y | 4\u03c0c\n| x\u2212 y |\nt\n\nThe first term is an instantaneous Biot-Savart term, the second term accounts for time\ndependence of the fields. These Helmholtz decompositions all have the feature that they are\nformally instantaneous in time.\n\n3. Angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field\nTo calculate the angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field we decompose the\nelectric field according to (2) and (4) and put the result into (1).\nThe contribution of the free field is given by the term in (2) that contains the vector potential field\nF. With the use of a standard vector identity we expand the vector product as\nArXiv\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\fAIR Congress 2005\n\nA.M.Stewart\n\n3\n\n(\u2207 x \u00d7 F) \u00d7 B = (B.\u2207 x )F \u2212 \u2211 B \u2207 x F\nr\n\nr\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nr=1\n\nThe first term contributes to the angular momentum an amount\nJ fs =\n\n1\nd3 x x \u00d7 (B.\u2207 x )F\n\u222b\n4\u03c0c\n\nor, in components,\n3\n1\nJ =\n\u03b5 ijk \u222b d3 x x j B r r F k\n\u2211\n4\u03c0c r, j,k =1\nx\ni\nfs\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the Levi-Civita tensor of rank 3.

Conclusion\nWe have obtained a decomposition of the angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic\nfield into orbital and spin components that is general and manifestly gauge invariant. This is done\nby decomposing the electric field into its longitudinal and transverse parts by means of the\nHelmholtz theorem. The orbital and spin components of the angular momentum of any specified\nelectromagnetic field can be found from this prescription.
