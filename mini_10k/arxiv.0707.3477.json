The diffuse elastic neutron scattering\nintensities in the spin ice regime can be remarkably well described by a phenomenological model\nof weakly interacting hexagonal spin clusters, as invoked in other geometrically frustrated magnets.\nWe present a highly refined microscopic theory of Dy2 Ti2 O7 that includes long range dipolar and\nexchange interactions to third nearest neighbors and which demonstrates that the clusters are purely\nfictitious in this material. The seeming emergence of composite spin clusters and their associated\nscattering pattern is instead an indicator of fine-tuning of ancillary correlations within a strongly\ncorrelated state.\n\nGeometrically frustrated magnetic materials have in\nrecent years furnished many new paradigms for the exploration of novel condensed states of matter. Examples include spin ice behavior [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], collective paramagnetism or spin liquid behaviour [12], spin\nglassiness in stoichiometrically pure materials [13] and an\nanomalous Hall effect [14]. Frustration is detrimental to\nthe development of conventional periodic arrangements\nof magnetic moments at low temperatures [15]. As a\nconsequence, at temperatures that are small compared\nto the scale of the leading interactions, highly frustrated\nsystems typically form collective dynamical states [16].\nMost commonly, the massive degeneracy of such \"cooperative paramagnetic\" states is ultimately resolved by specific material-dependent perturbative effects. This is the\norigin of the diversity of experimentally observed phenomena [15].\nAmong the many systems that exhibit geometric frustration [15], all the above phenomena have been observed\nin materials with magnetic moments (spins) residing on\na network of corner sharing tetrahedra, or pyrochlore lattice. This arrangement is found, for example, in the rare\nearth titanates R2 Ti2 O7 , with magnetic rare earth ions\n(R3+ = Ho, Dy . . . ), and in the spinels like AB2 X4 (A =\nZn, Cd), with magnetic transition metal ions (B = Fe3+ ,\nCr3+ ). In this paper we are concerned with Dy2 Ti2 O7 ,\na spin ice [1, 2, 3]. In this material, the local spin correlations are characterized by the ice rule: two spins point\nin and two spins point out of every tetrahedron [1, 2, 3].\nThe strongly correlated spin ice regime (analogous to the\nspin liquid or collective paramagnetic regime in geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets [16]) extends from 1 K\ndown to the lowest measured temperatures (. 100 mK).\nGiven the many phenomenologies exhibited by frustrated materials, the recent idea [17] that there may\nbe an organizing principle that describes the spin correlations in spin liquid states is very appealing. Using inelastic neutron scattering data, it was shown in\n\nRef. [17] that the spatial correlations of magnetic excitations in the spinel ZnCr2 O4 are well described by a\nmodel of strongly bound hexagonal spin clusters that\nare uncorrelated with respect to each other. Subsequently, similar evidence of such clusters was obtained\nin CdFe2 O4 [18], CdCr2 O4 [19] and Y0.5 Ca0.5 BaCo4 O7\n[20], lending weight to the idea that the clusters may effectively be emergent objects. In most cases it is numerically or analytically rather intractable to examine these\nsystems by detailed microscopic calculations. However,\nDy2 Ti2 O7 [2] provides an exception, as we show here [21].\nIn Ref. [7], we and collaborators showed that the\nwell-established microscopic \"standard dipolar spin ice\nmodel\" (s-DSM, defined below [3, 22, 23]) describes\nthe spin correlations in the spin ice state of Dy2 Ti2 O7\nwith only modest success. The original objective for\nthe present study was to understand the reason for the\ndifferences between theory and experiment. To do so,\nwe examined two models of the spin-spin correlations in\nDy2 Ti2 O7 by calculating the Fourier image, I(q), of the\nspin correlation function and comparing it to the energyintegrated neutron scattering structure factor [7]. The\nDy3+ ion in Dy2 Ti2 O7 has a Kramers doublet as singleion crystal field ground state [24] that, for each site i, is\nwell approximated by a classical Ising degree of freedom,\nsi = \u00b11, defined along its local [111] trigonal axis \u1e91i [22].\nWe calculate I(q) using [7]:\nI(q) =\n\n2\n[f (|q|)] X\nhsi sj i (\u1e91i\u22a5 * \u1e91j\u22a5 )eiq*rij ,\nN\nij\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h. . .i denote thermally averaged hsi sj i correlations\nbetween the Ising spins at sites i, j; \u1e91i\u22a5 is the component\nof the quantization direction at site i perpendicular to the\nscattering vector q, N is the number of spins and f (|q|)\nis the Dy3+ magnetic form factor [25]. For comparison\nwith experiment, I(q) is adjusted by an overall scale factor and a slowly varying linear-in-|q| background. The\nexperimental diffuse neutron scattering, measured in the\n\n\f2\nelastic approximation in the (hhl) plane (from Ref. [7]), is\nshown in Fig. 1a. As previously observed [7], in addition\nto structural Bragg peaks (e.g. (004), (222)) and bright\nbroad features at (001), (003) and ( 32 23 32 ), the experimental I(q) is further decorated by hexagonal loops of diffuse\nscattering running along the Brillouin zone boundaries.\nThe first model of correlations we examine is phenomenological and based on postulating an ansatz for\nhsi sj i in (1). We assume that hsi sj i can be viewed as\ngenerated by static clusters that remain uncorrelated between themselves. Each cluster is a zero-magnetization\nhexagonal loop of spins that circulate perpendicular to\nthe loop normal. These clusters are the discrete equivalent of the \"emergent\" clusters used to describe the inelastic I(q) in ZnCr2 O4 [17] (see Fig. 1c in Ref. [17]).\nTaking into account that all spins on a pyrochlore lattice\ncan be grouped into non-overlapping hexagons without\nbreaking the ice rules, that hexagon normals have four\npossible orientations, and that each hexagon has two possible senses of \"spin circulation\" around the normal, I(q)\ncan then be calculated using Eq. (1). Fig. 1b shows I(q)\ncalculated using the spin cluster scattering function. This\nmodel describes the experimental data quite well. The\nselection of hexagonal clusters as effective degrees of freedom in Dy2 Ti2 O7 does not incorporate any microscopic\ninformation about the host material, and thus be viewed\nas another example [17] of emergent composite spin clusters in frustrated systems.\nThe second approach we use to determine hsi sj i is microscopic. The s-DSM was previously shown to account\nfairly well for the spin ice phenomenology of Dy2 Ti2 O7\n[3, 22, 26]. It comprises the magneto-static dipole interaction, which gives a ferromagnetic nearest neighbor\ncoupling, that competes with a weaker antiferromagnetic\nnearest-neighbor exchange interaction J1 . Sufficiently\nstrong antiferromagnetic J1 would lead to long range\norder [22, 23]. It is the interplay between the properties of the spin ice manifold and the symmetry and\nlong range nature of the dipolar interaction that leads\nto a correlated spin ice state over an extended temperature range [22, 23, 27]. Surprisingly, the s-DSM is much\nless successful than the simple phenomenological cluster\nmodel at describing I(q).\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations have shown [7] that the\ns-DSM correctly describes the location and relative intensity of the strong I(q) features, but fails to reproduce the\nhexagonal zone boundary scattering (ZBS), Fig. 1c. We\ninterpret this as a sign that the s-DSM is incomplete and\nneeds to be extended [11, 28].\nDy2 Ti2 O7 displays a number of phase transitions and\nother structured response in an applied magnetic field\nH [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Independently of the disagreement between Fig. 1a and Fig. 1c, the necessity to adjust\nthe s-DSM was previously also suggested by the observation that, while it qualitatively explains the in-field\ntransitions, the s-DSM does not correctly predict their\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

The determination of the J\u03bd couplings in\nthe Hamiltonian ( 2) of Dy2 Ti2 O7 is obtained via a fitting to\nseveral bulk experimental thermodynamic data, akin to the\nprocedure illustrated here (see text).\n\ntween spin pairs. D = \u03bc0 (hJ zig\u03bcB )2 /(4\u03c0r1 3 ) = 1.3224\nK is the strength of the\u221adipolar interaction at nearestneighbor distance r1 = a 2/4, as obtained from the estimate hJ zi = 7.40 [29] within the ground state doublet of\nDy3+ in Dy2 Ti2 O7 , and from the size a = 10.124 \u00c5 [26]\nof the cubic unit cell of the material. g = 4/3 is the Dy3+\nLand\u00e9 factor, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, and J\u03bd is the exchange coupling of spins at distance r\u03bd . In reality, there\nshould be two different 3rd nearest neighbor exchange\ncouplings. We take them equal, which, as shown below,\nprovides a consistent description of Dy2 Ti2 O7 . By doing mean-field theory (MFT) calculations of I(q) in the\nparamagnetic regime [30] we checked that the conclusions\nabout I(q) are not sensitive to \u223c 50% deviations of the\ntwo J3 from equality.\nRather extensive MC simulations were used to investigate whether the g-DSM can provide a consistent description of the phenomenology of Dy2 Ti2 O7 both for H = 0\n[2, 4, 5] and H 6= 0 [2, 6, 8, 9, 10] regimes. MC simulations were performed on system sizes of 1024 = 43 \u00d7 16\nspins with periodic boundary conditions, treating the\nlong range dipolar interaction by the Ewald method [23].\nFor each set of parameters in (2) and each temperature,\n105 MC steps per spin for equilibration followed by an\nadditional 106 steps per spin for production were performed. The simulations exploited both single spin-flip\nand loop-update [23] Metropolis algorithms, the latter\nbeing a generalized algorithmic MC version of the dynamics of the hexagonal cluster degrees of freedom discussed above (cf. Fig. 1 [23]). Finite size effects were\nfound to be insignificant for the discussion below.\nThree groups of experimental data about Dy2 Ti2 O7\nare used to determine the J\u03bd in (2). First, we consider the\ntemperature-driven ferromagnetic ordering of Dy2 Ti2 O7\n\nfor H nearly along the [112] direction [9, 28]. For fixed\nD, the transition is controlled by J3 only [28]. Mapping the MC critical temperature, obtained as location\nof the maximum in magnetic heat capacity Cm , to the\nexperimental estimates of 0.34, 0.28(1) and 0.26(1) K,\nobtained by specific heat [2], susceptibility [9] and magnetization [10] measurements, we conclude that 0.019 K\n> J3 > 0.026 K. Second, we examine Cm (T ) data in\nH = 0 [2, 4, 5] for constraining J1 , J2 , as Cm (T ) is\nonly weakly sensitive to the allowed small variation of\nJ3 . We determine optimal J1 , J2 by minimizing the root\nmean square (RMS) deviation \u03c3 of experimental vs theoretical temperature curves for Cm (T )/T . The function\n\u03c3(J1 , J2 ) at J3 = 0.025 K is plotted in Fig. 2 using Ref. [4]\ndata. The two panels illustrate that \u03c3(J1 , J2 ) has a stable\nminimum even if determined over two different temperature intervals. Third, we exploit an empirical equation\nHc = 0.90(1) + 0.08T, T > 0.36 K [6, 8] for the line of\nphase transitions in Dy2 Ti2 O7 for H along [111]. We obtain values of Hc at several temperatures as positions of\nmaxima on MC Cm (H) curves, and vary J1 and J2 to\nmatch the experimental Hc (T ). This, the above H = 0\nanalysis and an additional observation that at H = 0\na magnetic phase transition, if any, can occur only at\nTc < 300 mK [3, 7], cf. Fig. 1a, yields: 3.26 K > J1 >\n3.53 K; \u22120.20 K > J2 < 0 K. Our value for J2 is consistent\nwith the value J2 = \u22120.1 K reported in Ref. [11] from\nfitting (2) with D = 1.41 K, J1 = 3.72 K, J3 = 0.03 K\n(Ref. [28]) to the experimental Cm (H) for H along [111].\nTo verify whether the experimental I(q) in Fig. 1a\ncan be described by (2), we perform MC simulations\nof the optimized g-DSM at 300 mK. We find that the\ng-DSM with J\u03bd couplings within the above allowed limits is consistent with the experimental scattering pattern\nin Fig. 1a, but requires even stronger restriction on J2 :\n\u22120.16 K > J2 > \u22120.10 K. For instance, the theoretical pattern at J1 = 3.41 K, J2 = \u22120.14 K, J3 = 0.025 K\n(Figs. 1d, f) reproduces the experimental one (Fig. 1a)\nextremely well. As seen from Figs. 1c, d, e and f,\nthe small adjustments to the initial s-DSM [22] do result in a redistribution of the scattering response, with\nintensities that now capture correctly both major features of the experimental pattern, and the weaker ZBS.\nThe characteristic features on the experimental I(q) for\nDy2 Ti2 O7 , first described above as arising from hexagonal spin clusters, can therefore be \"straightforwardly\"\ndescribed within a conventional microscopic treatment of\nthe static spin-spin correlation function [31].\nHaving now a credible microscopic model in hand, are\nwe able to explain the success of the phenomenological fit\n(Fig. 1b)? To answer this question, we examine the direct space hsi sj i correlations behind the reciprocal space\npatterns in Fig. 1b, c, d. We intimate that the picture of\nindependent clusters is equivalent to a correlation function truncated beyond third nearest neighbor distance\n(i.e. outside the hexagonal cluster). The hsi sj i obtained\n\n\f4\nfrom MC simulations on both the s-DSM (Fig. 1c) and\noptimized g-DSM (Fig. 1d) are very similar at short distances. If truncated beyond third nearest neighbor distance, the Fourier transform of each produces a pattern\nclose to that of experiment (Fig. 1a). We conclude that\nthe difference between the two MC I(q) patterns (Fig. 1c\nand Fig. 1d) is caused by correlations beyond third neighbors. For the tuned g-DSM, the long range part strongly\nreinforces the ZBS arising from the short range part,\ncontributing the majority of this scattering. This contradicts the notion of independent hexagons, which underly the calculation of I(q) in Fig. 1b, since correlations\nbetween hexagons are of the same order as the correlations defining the hexagons. Thus, weakly interacting\nclusters are not an appropriate microscopic description\nof Dy2 Ti2 O7 , nor are they here an effective organizing\nprinciple. Rather, the ZBS are caused by subsidiary\n(J2 and J3 ) interactions that are largely inconsequential to the formation of the strongly correlated spin ice\nregime [22, 23, 27]. We further confirmed the fine-tuned\nnature of the ZBS using MFT to calculate I(q) in the\nparamagnetic regime [30]. Finally, we note that independent hexagonal clusters, unlike the s-DSM and g-DSM,\nfail to predict the \"pinch point\" scattering characteristic\nof a spin ice manifold, which is discernable in the experiment.\nWe finally comment on the broader consequences that\nthe observed complementarity of the phenomenological\nand microscopic interpretations of neutron scattering\npatterns might have for other systems. Our results support the idea expressed in Ref. [17] that cluster-like scattering (CLS) may be common among highly frustrated\nmagnets and establish here a microscopic mechanism by\nwhich it can arise. However, by considering Dy2 Ti2 O7 as\na test case, we have shown that the CLS does not necessarily imply the emergence of \"real\" clusters [32], nor a\nnew organizing principle. Instead, the CLS is the property of a strongly correlated liquid-like state and a consequence of the sensitivity of frustrated systems to perturbations [16]. Our study also shows how neutron scattering can allow one to fully interpret CLS provided sufficiently accurate data and a computationally tractable\ntheoretical microscopic model are available.\nWe thank our collaborators in Ref.
