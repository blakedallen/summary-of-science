Improvements in the accuracy of atomic clocks continues unabated, and reports of progress in fountain\nclocks [1, 2] and optical lattice clocks [3, 4] are published monthly. An atomic clock with one part in 1016 accuracy\nhas been recently reported [5\u20137]; this is orders of magnitude better accuracy than the Cs standard atomic clocks. But\ncollisional frequency shifts can significantly impact both the stability and accuracy of atomic clocks. These effects have\nbeen systematically studied, e.g., for hydrogen [8], for Cs and Rb microwave clocks [10\u201312] as well as Sr optical clocks\n[5\u20137, 13]. It was conclusively demonstrated in the experiments reported in Refs. [6, 7] on a fermionic 87 Sr atomic clock\nthat quantum statistics can play a critical role in shaping interactions between atoms, and therefore in determining\ncollisional clock shifts. When the temperature of the fermionic atomic cloud is so low that the gas is degenerate, the\nPauli exclusion principle forces atoms in the gas that are in the same internal state to occupy different vibrational\nlevels, since their spatial wave function must be antisymmetric. These atoms cannot s-wave scatter and therefore,\nat low temperatures, where higher partial waves are frozen out, no collisional shift is possible. Refs. [6, 7] showed\nthat a small component of the probe beam along the weak confining direction leads to different Rabi frequencies for\nthe weak confining direction modes, and the optically induced inhomogeneity transfers some of the atoms into an\nantisymmetric internal state, and this antisymmetric state can s-wave scatter. This gives rise to a small collisional\nshift.\nThe analysis of the experimental results in Refs. [6, 7] was carried out assuming that the internal states of two\ncolliding atoms in the gas are in a pure state [ \u221a12 (|\u03c81 i|\u03c82 i \u2212 |\u03c82 i|\u03c81 i), as in Eq. (13), where |\u03c81 i and |\u03c82 i can be\nsuperposition states of the ground and excited clock states, as in Eq. (10)]. Moreover, reference [14], which introduces\na microscopic many-body approach to treat collisional shifts, Ref. [15], which reports exact calculations of collisional\nfrequency shifts for several fermions or bosons, and Ref. [16], which also calculates collisional shifts due to interatomic\ninteractions, all assume a pure internal state for colliding atoms in their analysis of collisional shifts. Here, we\ngeneralize the theoretical treatment of exchange symmetry considerations in collisional clock shifts to include mixed\n(density matrix) internal states for two colliding atoms, \u03c1AB,int [see Eq. (2)]. That is, our treatment does not assume\nthat the colliding atoms are in a pure internal state, but allows for mixed states to be treated. We shall also apply our\nanalysis to bosonic-atom atomic clocks. We assume that the atomic gas is sufficiently cold that only s-wave collisions\ncan occur, with higher partial waves frozen out because of the angular momentum barrier, but we do not assume\nthat the gas is fully degenerate. If the atoms in the gas are fermionic, but are not in the quantum-degenerate regime\n(i.e., is not described by a degenerate fermi sea of fermionic atoms), a mixed state description is in general required.\nSimilarly, bosonic atoms that are not in the quantum-degenerate regime, require a mixed-state description. We use\nthe mixed state (density matrix) description of Refs. [17, 18] to develop a formalism to treat the correlation and\nexchange symmetry considerations necessary to properly describe clock shifts due to collisions of atoms in a mixed\ninternal state. We are therefore able to determine how the fact that the gas in Refs. [6, 7] is not quantum-degenerate\naffects the calculation of the clock shifts. As we shall show, having a mixed state, rather than a pure state for the\ninternal state of the colliding atoms, does not strongly affect the calculated results for the experimental conditions\ndescribed in Refs. [6, 7].\nThe density matrix formalism we develop here could also allow for calculation of blackbody radiation effects for\natomic clock transitions. With the experimental demonstration of suppression of collisional clock shifts due to stronginteraction many-body effects [19] (which we do not attempt to model here, since this requires determining the\ncorrelated many-body state of the atoms in a strongly interacting gas, and is out of the scope of this work), calculation\nof blackbody radiation shifts becomes even more important, since this can be the largest remain contribution to the\nerror budget of the atomic clock.\n\n\f2\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we discuss the effects of exchange symmetry on the collisional\nfrequency shift in atomic clocks, Sec. III applies the concepts developed in Sec. II to a fermionic atomic clock. In\nSec. IV we calculate the collisional shift for a 87 Sr atomic clock with parameters similar to those used in Refs. [6, 7].\nSection V develops expressions for the clock shift of a bosonic atomic clock, and a summary and conclusion are\npresented in Sec. VI.\nII.\n\nEXCHANGE SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe density matrix characterizing systems of identical bosonic or fermionic atoms must be properly symmetrized.\nThis can be accomplished by applying symmetrization or antisymmetrization operators. For a degenerate gas of N\nbosonic atoms, the state can be symmetrized by applying the symmetrization operator S, whereas for fermionic atoms\nit must be antisymmetrized\nby applying the antisymmetrization operator A.P\nThe symmetrization operator for an N\nP\nparticle state is S \u2261 P P/N ! and the antisymmetrization operator is A \u2261 P \u03b4P P/N !, where P is a permutation\n\u0001\nN\nP\noperator, P = n11 n22 ...\n... nN , the sum is over all the N ! permutations of the atoms, and \u03b4P = (\u22121) [20]. For example,\n1\n1\nfor two atoms (say, that are undergoing a collision in a gas), S = 2 (1 + PAB ) and A = 2 (1 \u2212 PAB ). Thus, properly\nsymmetrized two-particle boson and fermion density matrices are of the form\n\u03c1sym\nAB =\n\n1\n1\n(1 + PAB )\u03c1AB (1 + PAB ) ,\n2\n2\n\n\u03c1antisym\n=\nAB\n\n1\n1\n(1 \u2212 PAB )\u03c1AB (1 \u2212 PAB ) .\n2\n2\n\n(1a)\n\n(1b)\n\nThe density matrix \u03c1AB for two colliding atoms has both an internal part, \u03c1AB,int (for atoms in an atomic clock,\nthe internal part can be restricted to involve only two atomic levels, the ground and excited levels participating in\nthe optical transition of the clock), and an external part, \u03c1AB,ext , involving the motional degrees of freedom of the\natoms:\n\u03c1AB = \u03c1AB,ext \u2297 \u03c1AB,int .\n\n(2)\n\nIf the atoms are free, or if they are confined by a harmonic potential, the external part can be separated into a center\nof mass and a relative motion part,\n\u03c1AB,ext = \u03c1AB,cm \u2297 \u03c1AB,rel .\n\n(3)\n\nA symmetric density matrix for the internal degrees of freedom, \u03c1AB,int = \u03c1sym\nAB , must be multiplied by a symmetric\n[antisymmetric] spatial density matrix \u03c1AB,rel in the spatial degree of freedom rAB = rA \u2212 rB for bosons [fermions],\nwhereas an antisymmetric internal density matrix, \u03c1AB,int = \u03c1anti\nAB , must be multiplied by an antisymmetric [symmetric]\nspatial density matrix \u03c1AB,rel for bosons [fermions], so that the full density matrix has the right exchange symmetry.\nFor cold gas temperatures, all but l = 0 partial waves are frozen out due to the angular momentum barrier potential\nVl (r) = ~2 l(l + 1)/(2\u03bcr2 ), where r = |rAB | is the relative distance between the colliding atoms and \u03bc is their reduced\nmass. Since s-wave scattering wave functions are symmetric in the exchange of the colliding particles, we conclude that\nat cold temperatures, the internal density matrix must be antisymmetric for colliding fermionic atoms and symmetric\nfor bosonic atoms.\nFor the internal degrees of freedom of the colliding atoms, the symmetrization operator is S = 21 (1 + PAB ) =\n3\n1\n1\n1\n4 + 4 \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B and the antisymmetrization operator is A = 2 (1 \u2212 PAB ) = 4 (1 \u2212 \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B ), hence, the density matrix\nfor the internal degrees of freedom are:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3 1\n3 1\nsym\n(4a)\n\u03c1AB =\n+ \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B \u03c1AB\n+ \u03c3A * \u03c3B ,\n4 4\n4 4\n\u03c1anti\nAB =\n\n1\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B) \u03c1AB (1 \u2212 \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B) .\n4\n4\n\n(4b)\n\nQuite generally, the density matrix for the internal degrees of freedom of two two-level systems can be written in\nterms of the Pauli matrices, \u03c3, for each of the two-level systems as follows [17, 18]:\n\u03c1AB =\n\n1\n[(1 + nA * \u03c3 A ) (1 + nB * \u03c3 B ) + \u03c3 A * CAB * \u03c3 B ] .\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nHere ni = h\u03c3 i i = Tr \u03c1\u03c3 i is the expectation value of the 'spin' (recall that this is the spin analogy used to describe\nour two-level system), as can be verified by multiplying (5) by \u03c3 i and tracing over the internal states of atoms A and\nB, and the correlation matrix is Cij,AB \u2261 h\u03c3i,A \u03c3j,B i \u2212 h\u03c3i,A ih\u03c3i,B i, as can be verified by multiplying (5) by \u03c3i,A \u03c3j,B\nand tracing. If the two colliding two-level atoms are in an uncorrelated (and therefore unentangled) state, CAB = 0,\nand the density matrix \u03c1AB reduces to a tensor product of the density matrices for each of the internal states of the\natoms, \u03c1AB = \u03c1A \u2297 \u03c1B .\nIII.\n\nFERMIONIC ATOM CLOCK\n\nThe trap potential holding the atoms is taken to be a harmonic oscillator potential (see Sec. IV), but at short\nrange, the potential is the molecular potential of the atoms. Hence, the potential between two atoms in the trap is\nthe molecular potential at short range (nm scale) and at large distance (\u03bcm or mm scale) it becomes the asymmetric\nharmonic potential confining the atoms. The external (trap) states of the atoms in the atomic clock will be taken to be\nthermally populated harmonic oscillator states at large relative internuclear distances (see Sec. IV), but in this section\nwe concentrate on the internal state of the atoms. The internal state for fermionic atoms must be anti-symmetrized at\nlow temperatures; hence, that part of an arbitrary initial density matrix \u03c1 for two atoms that s-wave scatters is given\nby A\u03c1AB A = \u03ba\u03c1singlet , where \u03c1singlet = 41 (1 \u2212 \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B ) is the density matrix of the singlet state and the correlation\nP\ncoefficient \u03ba = Tr A\u03c1AB A = 41 [1 \u2212 (nA * nB + i Cii )], i.e.,\n#) \u001a\n( \"\n\u001b\nX\n1\n1\n1 \u2212 (nA * nB +\nCii )\n(1 \u2212 \u03c3 A * \u03c3 B ) .\n(6)\n\u03ba \u03c1singlet =\n4\n4\ni\nP\nThe quantity \u03ba \u2261 14 [1 \u2212 (nA * nB + i Cii )] is the fraction of the density matrix that is in the singlet state. Only\nthis part of the initial density matrix is able to s-wave scatter when the atoms are fermions. The expression in Eq. (6)\nplainly involves the correlation of the spins, both because of the the spin-correlation term involving the C matrix and\nthe nA * nB term. The clock shift for fermionic atoms is given by the expression [6, 8, 10, 12, 23, 24]\n1\n\u2206\u03bd =\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\n1\n2~\nas,ge\ndt \u2206\u03bd(t) =\nm\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\ndt \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere as,ge is the s-wave scattering length for collisions of atoms in states g and e, and the correlation coefficient\n\u03ba(t) is the instantaneous collisional shift parameter for fermions, equal to the the pair correlation function G(2) (0)\nfor collisions of pure internal states, but more generally is given by\n!#\n\"\nX\n1\n\u03ba(t) =\nCii (t)\n.\n(8)\n1 \u2212 nA (t) * nB (t) +\n4\ni\nng (t) and ne (t) are the densities of atoms in the ground and excited state respectively [ng = \u033a\u03c1gg , ne = \u033a\u03c1ee ]\nand \u033a = N/V is the density of atoms in the gas. Note that the instantaneous collisional shift \u2206\u03bd(t) =\n(2~/m)as,ge \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)], i.e., is proportional to \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)].\nIf the two colliding atoms are in a pure internal state with the atoms in the same superposition state, |\u03c81 iA = |\u03c81 iB ,\nthen the two-particle internal state is a product state with nA * nB = 1 and CAB = 0, so \u03ba(t) \u2261 0, and no collisional\nshift is present. Since, as explained in Refs. [6, 7], atoms in different trap states Rabi-flop at different rates, collisional\nshifts in pure-internal states are nonvanishing. It is instructive to consider the case of a two-atom density matrix that\ncorresponds to a product state,\n|\u03a8i = |\u03c81 iA |\u03c82 iB ,\nwith \u03c81 6= \u03c82 . This is an uncorrelated (unentangled) pure internal state with\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03b4\n\u03b2\n,\n, |\u03c82 iB = \u03b3|gi + \u03b4|ei =\n|\u03c81 iA = \u03b1|gi + \u03b2|ei =\n\u03b3\n\u03b1\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhose density matrix in (5) is also a product density density matrix, \u03c1AB = \u03c1A \u2297 \u03c1B , and CAB = 0. Hence, Eq. (8)\nbecomes\n\u03ba(t) =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 nA (t) * nB (t)) ,\n4\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nwhere the unit vector nj for particle j (= A, B) is nj = (sin \u03b8j cos \u03c6j , sin \u03b8j sin \u03c6j , cos \u03b8j ) = (xj , yj , zj ). Up to a\nmultiplicative phase factor,\n\u0012 xA \u2212iyA \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u2212i\u03c6\n\u221a\n\u03b2\ne A cos(\u03b8A /2)\n\u22121/2\n\u221a 1\u2212zA\n,\n(12)\n=2\n=\n|\u03c81 iA =\n\u03b1\nsin(\u03b8A /2)\n1 \u2212 zA\n\u0001\nand similarly for |\u03c82 iB = \u03b3\u03b4 . A simple example may be helpful. Suppose particle A is in state |gi \u2261 |\u2193i and particle\nB is in state |ei = |\u2191i, and the particles are uncorrelated so \u03c1AB = \u03c1A \u2297 \u03c1B ; then nA = \u2212\u1e91 and nB = \u1e91, and using\n(11), \u03ba = 1/2. This result can be easily understood by noting that the state can be written as a fifty-fifty incoherent\nsuperposition of a singlet and triplet density matrix, hence \u03ba = 1/2.\nLet us compare with the case when the gas is fully coherent and the internal state of two fermions that interact via\ns-wave scattering is in an antisymmetric pure entangled state,\n1\n|\u03a8AS i = \u221a (|\u03c81 i|\u03c82 i \u2212 |\u03c82 i|\u03c81 i) .\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThis is the form of the internal state taken in the collisional shift calculation of Ref. [6]; the internal state of the\ntwo colliding particles is a fully coherent antisymmetric state (13), and therefore the internal state density matrix (5)\ncorresponding to this state has only one non-zero eigenvalue, which is unity. The collisional clock shift \u2206\u03bd is then\nproportional to\n(2)\n\n2\n\n\u03ba\u0303(t) \u2261 GAS (0) = h\u03a8AS |\u03a8AS i = 1 \u2212 |\u03b1(t)\u03b3 \u2217 (t) + \u03b2(t)\u03b4 \u2217 (t)| .\n\n(14)\n(2)\n\n\u03ba\u0303(t) for the pure state fermion case reduces to the general result \u03ba(t) in Eq. (8), i.e., for a pure state, \u03ba = \u03ba\u0303 = GAS (0),\n(2)\nwhere GAS (0) is the pair correlation function for fermions at zero relative distance. For the specific simple example\nsuggested above, \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 0, \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b4 = 1, so \u03ba\u0303 = 1, whereas \u03ba = 1/2. Hence, the collisional clock shift for the\nmixed state is half that obtained for the antisymmetric state. Reference [6] assumes the internal states of the atoms\nin the gas is fully coherent, as in a fully degenerate gas, and therefore the internal quantum state of the two particles\ncolliding in an s-wave collision must be antisymmetrized as in Eq. (13). We do not necessarily assume that the gas\nis degenerate, hence we use a density matrix description. In our simple example, the two colliding particles in the\ngas are either (with probability 50%) in an internal antisymmetric state (in which case the motional state must be\nsymmetric) or in an internal symmetric state (in which case the motional state must be antisymmetric so only odd\npartial waves occur, but since the gas is cold, these collisions are frozen out, i.e., only s-wave collisions occur). Hence,\nin the simple example considered here, both possibilities occur with equal probability, and the factor \u03ba = 1/2. Note\nthat, if the gas really is fully degenerate, only the antisymmetric internal state (i.e., the singlet) is populated, and \u03ba\nis be unity, as obtained in Ref. [6].\nThe collisional shift parameter \u03ba for the state in the specific simple example above is the largest possible for any\nproduct state, and it has \u03ba = 1/2. The largest possible collisional shift parameter for an antisymmetric pure state is\n\u03ba\u0303 = 1. The smallest collisional shift is for the product state with nA * nB = 1, i.e., |\u03c81 i = |\u03c82 i, for which \u03ba = 0. The\nsmallest possible collisional shift parameter for an antisymmetric pure state is \u03ba\u0303 = 0. For any given |\u03c81 i and |\u03c82 i,\n\u03ba for the product state is always smaller than \u03ba\u0303 for the antisymmetric state (13), \u03ba \u2264 \u03ba\u0303. This suggests that it may\nnot be worth going to the degenerate gas limit for a fermionic gas, i.e., it would suggest that the collisional shift is\nsmaller if the gas is not fully quantum degenerate.\nNote that the uncorrelated case, \u03c1AB = \u03c1A \u2297 \u03c1B in (9), and the pure entangled state case corresponding to |\u03a8AS i\nin Eq. (13), are the two extreme cases of states that are possible; mixed correlated and mixed entangled states fall\nin between these two limits [17]. Note also that our formulation allows us to specify any many-body state of the gas\nand thereby calculate the clock shift for arbitrary many-body gas states by tracing out all but two particles, thereby\nobtaining a two-particle density matrix.\nIV.\n\nMODELING THE\n\n87\n\nSR OPTICAL CLOCK\n\nIn the experiments reported in Refs. [6, 7], a gas of 87 Sr 1 S0 (F = 9/2) atoms in a magic wavelength optical\nlattice [4] with wavelength \u03bb = 813.43 nm, which to a good approximation forms a harmonic trap with frequencies\n\u03c9x = \u03c9y = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 450 Hz and \u03c9z \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 80 KHz, is optically pumped to the mF = 9/2 (or the mF = \u22129/2) state.\nThe excited clock state, |ei(\u2261 |\u2191i), is the 3 P0 state and the clock transition has a wavelength of \u2248 698 nm. The gas is\nat a sufficiently high temperature (e.g., T = 1 \u03bcK or 3 \u03bcK) that the harmonic oscillator motional states (nx , ny , nz )\nof the atoms in the gas can be considered populated according to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (at T = 1 \u03bcK,\n\n\f5\nnx = ny = 46). The laser probing the clock transition propagates along the 1D lattice axis, and the atoms in the gas\nhave a slightly different Rabi frequency \u03a9nx ,ny ,nz depending on which trap state they populate. With perfect alignment\nof the probe laser along the strong confinement axis, a residual angular spread \u2206\u03b8 between the probe laser beam and\nthe optical lattice k remains due to the finite size of the lattice beam. Moreover, if the symmetry is broken due to either\naberrations in the beam profile or angular misalignment \u2206\u03b8 between the lattice and the probe beam, an even larger\neffective misalignment results. As explained in Ref. [7], since the transverse trap is isotropic, a small net misalignment\nangle \u2206\u03b8 along x\u0302 results in a wavevector of the probe laser that is given by k \u2248 k(\u1e91 + \u2206\u03b8 x\u0302). Hence, there are slightly\n2\n2\n2\ndifferent Rabi frequencies for the different trap states, \u03a9nx ,ny ,nz = \u03a90 e(\u2212\u03b7x \u2212\u03b7y \u2212\u03b7z )/2 Lnx (\u03b7x2 )Lny (\u03b7y2 )Lnz (\u03b7z2 ), where\n\u03a90 is the bare Rabi frequency, Lni are Laguerre\nq \u03b7i are the Lamb-Dicke parameters for the transverse\nqpolynomials, and\n~\n~\n1\n\u221a\nand longitudinal directions, \u03b7x = \u03b7y = sin(\u2206\u03b8)\n2m\u03c9x , \u03b7z = \u03bbL\n2m\u03c9z [6, 21].\n2 \u03bbL\nWe now calculate the clock shift for such a cold but non-degenerate gas with a thermal population of trap states\nand an internal state so that two colliding atoms are in a non-correlated product internal state. The internal state\ndensity matrix is given at any time t by a general two-qubit classically-correlated state that takes the form [17]\n\n\u03c1CC (t) =\n\nX\n1X\nPk (1 + nA,k (t) * \u03c3 A )\nPl (1 + nB,l (t) * \u03c3 B ) ,\n4\nk\n\n(15)\n\nl\n\nP\nwhere k = nx , ny , nz , and Pk = e\u2212Ek /T / k\u2032 e\u2212Ek\u2032 /T is the Boltzmann distribution probability for state k (and\nsimilarly for Pl ). Presumably {Pk } are constant in time. We used a Bolzmann distribution to calculate the probabilities\nfor finding atoms in the various trap states in the calculations for the 87 Sr clock in Sec. IV A, since the experimental\ntemperatures used were sufficiently high for this to be an excellent approximation. At lower temperatures we would\nuse the correct fermi (or, in the case of bosons, bose) distribution. The evolution of the unit vectors nA,k (t) and\nnB,k (t), and the population densities ng (t), ne (t) (which are also functions of the trap state k) are given by the\nevolution operator for the two-level system in the presence of the probe laser, U(t, 0) = e\u2212iHLM t/~ , where HLM is the\nlight-matter Hamiltonian, is given by\n!\n\u03a9 t\n\u03a9 t\n\u03a9g t\ni\u2206\ni\u03a9\ncos( 2g ) + \u03a9\nsin( 2g )\n\u03a9g sin( 2 )\ng\n.\n(16)\nU(t, 0) =\n\u03a9 t\n\u03a9g t\n\u03a9 t\ni\u2206\ni\u03a9\ncos( 2g ) \u2212 \u03a9\nsin( 2g )\n\u03a9g sin( 2 )\ng\np\nWe defined the generalized Rabi frequency, \u03a9g \u2261 |\u03a9nx ,ny ,nz |2 + \u22062 , and the laser detuning \u2206 = \u03c9 \u2212 (Ee \u2212 Eg )/~.\nFor an atom that at t = 0 is in the ground electronic state and in trap state nx , ny , nz , the amplitudes \u03b1(t) and \u03b2(t)\nof (12) are\n\u03b1nx ,ny ,nz (t) = cos(\n\n\u03a9g t\ni\u2206\n\u03a9g t\nsin(\n)\u2212\n),\n2\n\u03a9g\n2\n\n\u03b2nx ,ny ,nz (t) =\n\n\u03a9g t\ni\u03a9\nsin(\n).\n\u03a9g\n2\n\n(17)\n\nThe density matrix for the classically-correlated state can be written in the form of Eq.

Note that \u03ba(t) cannot be written as a product of averages over the first and second\nparticles separately since \u0398k,l (t) generally does not factorize into a product of terms depending separately on the first\nand second particle. In the clock shift calculation we need to average over motional states as follows:\nZ\nZ\n1 T\n1 T\n2~\nas,ge\ndt \u2206\u03bd(t) =\ndt \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] ,\n\u2206\u03bd =\n(20)\nT 0\nm\nT 0\nwhere\n(\n)\nX\n1X\n\u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] =\nPk [ng,k (t) \u2212 ne,k (t)]\nPl [1 \u2212 nA,k (t) * nB,l (t)] .\n4\nk\n\nl\n\n(21)\n\n\f6\nNote that the quantity \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] is proportional to the average instantaneous frequency shift \u2206\u03bd(t), i.e.,\n\u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] = 2~ams,ge \u2206\u03bd(t).\nWe also calculate the collisional clock shift for a gas with thermal population of trap states and an internal state\nso that two colliding atoms are in an entangled internal state with collisional shift parameter \u03ba\u0303(t),\nX\nX\n2\n\u03ba\u0303(t) =\nPk Pl\nPk Pl [1 \u2212 |\u03b1(t)\u03b3 \u2217 (t) + \u03b2(t)\u03b4 \u2217 (t)| ] .\n(22)\nk,l\n\nk,l\n\nThe instantaneous collisional clock shift in this case is proportional to \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)]. We are therefore able to\ncompare and contrast this with \u03ba(t). Note that the average \u03ba\u0303(t), can be written as an average of \u03ba\u0303(t) over nx , ny ,\nnz for each of the two particles A and B, but this average also cannot be expressed by taking averages over \u03b1, \u03b2,\nand \u03b3 and \u03b4 separately because \u03ba\u0303(t) does not factorize into a product of terms depending separately on the first and\nsecond particle.\nA.\n\nResults of\n\n87\n\nSr Atomic Clock Calculations\n\nWe now present numerical results that highlight the difference between using the two extreme limits for describing\nthe internal states of two colliding atoms in the gas: a product state given by \u03c1AB = \u03c1A \u2297\u03c1B and a pure antisymmetric\nstate as given in Eq. (13).\nIn our calculations we use parameters for the system based upon those in Refs. [6, 7]. In all of our calculations we\nuse a Rabi frequency \u03a90 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 59 Hz. Figure 1 shows the average population inversion [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] versus time\nfor detunings \u2206 = 2\u03c0\u00d7 0, 25 and 50 Hz for a gas at temperature T = 1 \u03bcK and for a laser misalignment of \u2206\u03b8 = 10\nmrad. The atoms start off at t = 0 in the ground electronic state and Rabi flop with time. For zero detuning, the\noscillation of the average population inversion with time is about zero population inversion, but for finite \u2206 the time\naveraged population is different from zero, and grows with detuning since less atoms are put into the excited state for\nhigher detuning. The decay of the Rabi oscillations with time results because of the thermal distribution of the atoms\nand the fact that the Rabi frequencies \u03a9nx ,ny ,nz depend on the trap state populated in the thermal distribution.\n\nFIG. 1: Average population inversion, [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)], versus time for three different detunings for T = 1 \u03bcK. The fact that the\nRabi frequency depends on the motional state causes the amplitude of the Rabi oscillations to decay with time.\n\nFigure 2 compares the average correlation coefficient \u03ba(t) (heavy curves) and the pure-state \u03ba\u0303(t) (dashed curves)\nversus time for \u2206 = 2\u03c0\u00d7 0, 25 and 50 Hz and for a gas temperature T = 1 \u03bcK. The largest difference between \u03ba(t)\nand \u03ba\u0303(t) occurs for \u2206 = 0, and the difference diminishes with increasing \u2206. The average correlation impacts the\naverage collisional frequency shift [see Eqs. (19), (20) and (21)]. We see from the figure that these quantities increase\nwith the clock run-time. For small detunings, the average pair correlation function at zero particle separation for\npure states, \u03ba\u0303(t) = G(2) (0), is substantially larger than \u03ba(t) for the product states, and the difference between these\nquantities diminishes with increasing \u2206. This, of course affects, the collisional clock shift, as we shall see in the next\nfigure.\nFigure 3 shows the quantity \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] versus time calculated for three detunings, \u2206 = 2\u03c0\u00d7 0, 25 and\n50 Hz, and for T = 1 \u03bcK. This quantity is proportional to the instantaneous clock shift \u2206\u03bd(t) (but since the s-wave\nscattering length as,ge is not well known, the factor (2~/m)as,ge in Eq. (7) is removed from the quantity plotted). It\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) \u03ba(t) (heavy curves) and the pure-state \u03ba\u0303(t) (light curves) versus time for three different detunings and\nfor T = 1 \u03bcK.\n\nis clear from Fig. 3, and from Eq. (7), that the temporal average of the clock shift for \u2206 = 0 will be close to zero if\nthe temporal average is taken over a time tf = T , which corresponds to a full Rabi cycle, but for finite detuning, the\ntemporally averaged clock shift grows with detuning.\nFigure 4 compares the product state \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] (solid red curves) and the pure-state \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)]\n(dashed black curves) for \u2206 = 0 and \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 50 Hz. The \u2248 25% difference between \u03ba(t) and \u03ba\u0303(t) evident in Fig. 2\nfor \u2206 = 0 at large times shows up mostly at the extrema of \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] and \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] in Fig .4;\nelsewhere the population-difference [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] becomes small and the difference between the averaged quantities\nplotted in Fig. 4 become small and hard to see. As the detuning increases, the magnitude of the collisional phase\nshift is greater for \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] than for \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)], but the differences in \u03ba(t) and \u03ba\u0303(t) decrease with\nincreased detuning, as evident from Fig. 2. Thus, the non-degenerate gas has a lower clock shift (in magnitude) than\nthe gas degenerate with an antisymmetric internal state. The effect appears to be very small, but in fact, we shall\nsee in Fig. 8 that, partly due strong cancellation of the positive and negative clock shifts [particularly for \u2206 = 0 \u2013 see\nFig. 4(a)], the time averaged clock shifts \u03ba(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] and \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] are not inconsequential.\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)], which is proportional to the clock shift \u2206\u03bd(t), versus time for three different detunings\nand for T = 1 \u03bcK.\n\nFigure 5 compares \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] (solid red curves) and \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] as a function of time for three\ndifferent detunings at a relatively high temperature of T = 10 \u03bcK. The magnitude of the collisional phase shift is\na little larger for \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] than for \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)]. The difference increases with increasing detuning,\nbut then saturates. The behavior here for T = 10 \u03bcK is actually quite a bit different from that shown in Fig. 4\nfor T = 1 \u03bcK. For example, the decay of the clock shift oscillations as a function of time at \u2206 = 0 in Fig. 5 is not\nevident in Fig. 4, and the oscillations with time at \u2206 = 2\u03c0\u00d750 Hz in Fig. 4 are largely damped in Fig. 5. Here (and\nin Fig. 4), for zero detuning, the instantaneous clock shift oscillates around zero with time but this changes with\nincreased detuning. Note that the ordinate scales of the three frames in Fig. 5 are different.\nFigure 6(a) plots the average excited state population ne (tf ) and Fig. 6(b) the average clock shift\n\u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] versus detuning \u2206 for tf = 80 ms (note that for Figs. 6-8, the bar indicating average also\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) (a) \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] (solid red curves), which is proportional to the clock shift \u2206\u03bd(t), and the purestate \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] (dashed black curves) versus time for detuning \u2206 = 0, and (b) \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 50 Hz. The gas temperature\nis taken to be T = 1 \u03bcK.\n\nmeans average over the clock time tf ). The population for \u2206 = 0 and tf = 80 ms is about 60% in the excited\nstate, so ne (tf ) > ng (tf ). This is why the quantity \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] is negative for \u2206 = 0. At the detuning\n\u2206 \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.15 Hz for which ne (tf ) = 0.5, clearly, \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] = 0. At higher detunings, the oscillations in\n\u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] as a function of detuning is due to the oscillations in the population ne (tf ) versus \u2206.\nFigure 7 plots ne (tf ) and \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] versus detuning \u2206 for T = 1 \u03bcK and T = 3 \u03bcK at a pulse duration\nof tf = 1.7 ms, which is near the start of the first Rabi cycle - see Fig. 1. Both the average excited state fraction\nin Fig. 7(a) and the collisional shift in Fig. 7(b) are smaller for the larger temperature. The collisional shift is seen\nto be very substantially smaller at T = 1 \u03bcK than for T = 3 \u03bcK in Fig. 7(b). The temperature effect is dramatic for\nall detunings, i.e., \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] is significantly reduced as the temperature is decreased from T = 3 \u03bcK to\nT = 1 \u03bcK for virtually all detunings. At \u2206 = 0, \u03ba(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] is positive [in contrast with Fig. 6 for tf = 80\nms], since this is at the start of the first Rabi cycle (see Fig. 1) and ne (tf ) \u226a ng (tf ). Moreover, very little vestige\nremains of the oscillations with detuning that was so prominent in Fig. 7. It is interesting to note that if one plots\n\u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )] versus ne (tf ) [i.e., if one plots the ordinate of Fig. 7(b) versus the ordinate of Fig. 7(a)], the\ncollisional shift is nearly linear with ne (tf ) for both T = 1 \u03bcK and T = 3 \u03bcK, but the slope is strongly temperature\ndependent and increases with increasing temperature. Holding ne (tf ) (or the excitation fraction) constant, and\nlowering the temperature of the gas, serves to significantly lower clock shifts in this regime of low excitation fraction.\nFigure 8 plots the clock shift \u2206\u03bd for tf = 80 ms as a function of temperature for four different detunings. For \u2206 = 0\nand \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 15 Hz, the collisional shift first decreases with temperature from zero to around a value of \u22120.05, and\nat around 0.75 \u03bcK, \u2206\u03bd begins to increase with temperature. At large temperatures, \u2206\u03bd appears to tend to zero. For\nthe higher detunings of \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 25 and \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 50 Hz shown in the second panel, the collisional shift increases\nwith increasing temperature and then saturates. Again, the magnitude of \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] is almost always smaller\nthan \u03ba\u0303(tf ) [ng (tf ) \u2212 ne (tf )]. Moreover, we see a very different temperature dependence of the clock shift for small\ndetunings than for larger detunings.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) \u03ba(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] (solid red curves) and \u03ba\u0303(t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] (dashed black curves) versus time for 3\ndetunings, \u2206 = 0, \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 25 and \u2206 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 50 Hz, and for T = 10 \u03bcK. Note the different ordinate scales.\nV.\n\nBOSONIC ATOM CLOCK\n\nLet us now consider a non-degenerate gas of bosonic atoms that is nevertheless sufficiently cold so that only swave collisions participate in the collisional frequency shift. For example, consider an atomic clock based on neutral\nbosonic atoms trapped in a deep \"magic-wavelength\" optical lattice, or more specifically, 88 Sr atoms in the 5s2 1 S0\n|F = 0, MF = 0i. A weak transition to the 3 P0 |F = 0, MF = 0i state is available when a static magnetic field\nenables a direct optical excitation of forbidden electric-dipole character, that is otherwise prohibitively weak (the\ntransition occurs by mixing the 3 P1 with the 3 P0 state) [22]. Such an atomic clock, probed using Ramsey fringe\nspectroscopy [26], was analyzed in Ref. [27]. For the collision of two bosons in such a gas via s-wave collisions, the\ninternal two-particle state must also be symmetric. The internal states of the atoms in such a collision can be of the\nform |\u2191\u2193i + |\u2193\u2191i, | \u2193\u2193i or |\u2191\u2191i, where |\u2193i \u2261 |gi and |\u2191i \u2261 |ei. The s-wave scattering lengths for these states are denoted\nas,ge , as,gg and as,ee respectively. The Hamiltonian is given by [27],\n\u0124 =\n\nX\n\ni=g,e\n\n\u2206(a\u2020e \u00e2e \u2212 a\u2020g \u00e2g ) \u2212\n\n~\u03a9(t) \u2020\n4\u03c0~2 X\nas,ij \u00e2\u2020i \u00e2\u2020j \u00e2j \u00e2i .\n(\u00e2g \u00e2e + \u00e2\u2020e \u00e2g ) +\n2\nm i,j=g,e\n\nThis leads to the following formula for the collisional frequency shift for bosons [12, 23, 24]:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n2~ 1 T\n.\ndt as,ge \u03ba |\u2191\u2193i+|\n\u2206\u03bd =\n\u2193\u2191i (t) [ng (t) \u2212 ne (t)] + as,gg \u03ba|\u2193\u2193i (t)ng (t) + as,ee \u03ba|\u2191\u2191i (t)ne (t)\n\u221a\nm T 0\n2\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\n\f10\nThis expression can be compared with Eq. (7) for the fermion case. Here, clock shifts are due to gg s-wave collisions,\nee s-wave collisions and ge s-wave collisions. The three \u03ba correlation parameters that multiply these scattering lengths\ncan be determined by calculating the projection of the density matrix of two colliding particles onto the symmetric\nstates, \u221a12 (|\u2191\u2193i + |\u2193\u2191i), |\u2191\u2191i and |\u2193\u2193i. For example,\nP|\u2191\u2191i \u03c1AB (t) P|\u2191\u2191i = \u03ba|\u2191\u2191i (t)\u03c1|\u2191\u2191i (t) ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere P|\u2191\u2191i = | \u2191\u2191i h\u2191\u2191 | is the projector onto state | \u2191\u2191i, and\n\u03ba|\u2191\u2191i (t) = Tr(P|\u2191\u2191i \u03c1AB (t) P|\u2191\u2191i ) .\n\n(26)\n\nAfter some algebra, we find that the correlation coefficients are given in terms of the parameters of the density matrix\nin Eq. (5) by\n\u03ba |\u2191\u2193i+|\n\u2193\u2191i =\n\u221a\n2\n\n1\n[1 + nA,x nB,x + nA,y nB,y \u2212 nA,z nB,z + Cxx + Cyy \u2212 Czz ] ,\n4\n\n1\n[1 \u2212 nA,z \u2212 nB,z + nA,z nB,z + Czz ] ,\n4\n1\n= [1 + nA,z + nB,z + nA,z nB,z + Czz ] .\n4\n\n(27)\n\n\u03ba|\u2193\u2193i =\n\n(28)\n\n\u03ba|\u2191\u2191i\n\n(29)\n\nWhen the atoms are not correlated, the Cij terms vanish in these formulas, and the correlation coefficients are given\nslowly in terms of the expectation values {nJ,i } of the \"spins\".\nIn order to use these results to calculate the clock shifts for atomic clocks using such atoms as 133 Cs and 87 Rb\nand 88 Sr, three s-wave scattering lengths, as,gg , as,ee and as,ge would are required. Hopefully, improved experimental\nvalues for these s-wave scattering lengths, perhaps in conjunction with theoretical calculations, will allow comparison\nof theory with collisional clock shifts for bosonic atomic clocks.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we developed a formalism that can be used to calculate atomic clock shifts for arbitrary mixed states\nof an atomic gas. We applied the formalism to the fermionic 87 Sr atomic clock reported in Refs. [6, 7]. When the\ntwo fermions that collide in the gas are in a pure antisymmetric internal state, |\u03a8AS i = \u221a12 (|\u03c81 i|\u03c82 i \u2212 |\u03c82 i|\u03c81 i), the\nformalism reduces to the one presented in Ref. [6]. For sufficiently high temperatures (e.g., T = 1 or 3 \u03bcK), the gas\nmay be closer to an uncorrelated gas, and we can treat this case, as well as the case of an arbitrary initial correlated\nstate by projecting out the two-body density matrix and using it to describe the collision process of the atoms in the\natomic clock. We saw in Sec. IV A that, for the experimental conditions described in Refs. [6, 7], when the internal\nstate of colliding pairs of atoms in the gas is taken as product mixed state rather than an antisymmetric pure state,\nthe collisional cloch shift is somewhat reduced, but the reduction is small. Moreover, we showed how the formalism\ncan be used to describe a bose gas; then, all the s-wave scattering lengths (as,gg , as,ee , as,eg ) are required to calculate\nthe collisional clock shift [27].\nThe formalism developed here can also be applied to atomic clocks that use the Ramsey fringe double resonance\ntechnique [26, 27]. Moreover it can be used for clocks that have a strongly correlated initial state, since arbitrary\ntwo-particle density matrices can be modeled using the form in Eq. (5). Furthermore, even if the initial gas is a highly\ncorrelated many-body state, the two-body density matrix can be projected out of the many-body density matrix. The\nformalism might also be of utility for treating magnetometry wherein the collisions affect the spin-relaxation time\ndepolarization via depolarization.\nAnother possible application of the density matrix methods introduced here is to calculation blackbody radiation\n(BBR) shifts. BBR shifts in atomic clocks are caused by perturbation of the atomic energy levels of the ground and\nexcited clock levels by the oscillating thermal radiation. Since we can carry out calculations with arbitrary density\nmatrix (mixed) states, our method could be used to calculate blackbody radiation (BBR) effects, which can populate\nboth ground and excited clock states of an atomic clock operating at microwave frequencies, if the clock operates\nat room temperature. Moreover, both ground and excited atomic levels of an optical frequency clock transition are\nperturbed by BBR, e.g., for the 1 S0 \u2192 3 P0 clock transition of strontium, both clock levels experience a BBR shift\n[25]. The overall BBR correction is the difference of the BBR shifts for the two levels. If there is a small residual\nmagnetic field present, the BBR could shift the energy of ground hyperfine levels due to coupling between the various\nF, MF levels of the ground state. Such shifts would be in addition to shifts due to coupling of the ground and excited\nclock states to other states. A density matrix method of the type introduced here could be used to deal with the\nformer type of clock shift.\n\n\f11\nAcknowledgments\n\nUseful discussions with Professor Jun Ye are gratefully acknowledged.
