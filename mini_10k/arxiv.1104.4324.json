Introduction\nIn the area of voting theory in political science, monotone yes/no voting systems\nare studied. If V is a set of voters, then a subset of voters, C \u2282 V is called a losing\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\ncoalition if the voters in C are not sufficient to force an initiative to pass. One can\nform a simplicial complex (see [H] or [Mu] for background on simplicial complexes)\nX with vertex set V to encode the voting system by declaring F = [v0 , . . . , vn ]\nto be a face of X if and only if {v0 , . . . , vn } is a losing coalition. The monotone\nproperty of the voting system then guarantees that any face of a face in X is also\na face in X and so X is indeed a simplicial complex. In voting theory, it is shown\nthat every voting system can be weighted so that it is a quota system. In this\npaper we study the topological behaviour of various quota complexes as the quota\nis changed. The issues involved are essentially those involved in Morse theory or\npersistant homology where the change in topology of a set is studied as a parameter\nis increased.\nFor example in [EH] and [Ka], the topology of a finite union of balls of radius r\nin Rn , is studied as a function of r for fixed centers. This is used both in generating\nrandom complexes and in studying the persistant shapes/homology of random data\nsets.\nIn this paper we first discuss some basic topological properties of quota sets. We\nthen illustrate the theory with examples in arithmetic involving the distribution of\nprimes, squares, cubes and divisors of a fixed number.\nIn all these cases, the quota complexes encode significant distributional information and our aim is to illustrate some of this.\nLet R+ be the set of positive real numbers.\nDefinition 1.1. Let V be a vertex set. A scalar-valued quota system on V is given\nby a weight function w : V \u2192 R+ and quota q > 0. The quota complex X[w : q]\nis the simplicial complex on vertex\nPn set V such that a face F = [v0 , . . . , vn ] is in\nX[w : q] if and only if w(F ) = i=0 w(vi ) < q.\nFor example, if we have 3 vertices {a, b, c} with weights {2, 3, 5} respectively\nthen at quota q = 9, the corresponding quota complex would be the boundary of\na triangle with corners {a, b, c}. The interior would not be included as the face\n[a, b, c] has weight 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 > 9. If the quota is raised to 11, this face would\nbe included to give a solid triangle whereas if the quota were lowered to 8, the edge\n[b, c] would be excluded from the complex as it has weight 3 + 5 = 8.\nDefinition 1.2. Let V be a vertex set. A vector-valued quota system on V is given\nby a weight function \u0175 : V \u2192 Rs+ and quota q\u0302 \u2208 Rs+ . The quota complex X[\u0175 : q\u0302]\nis the simplicial complex\nPnon vertex set V such that a face F = [v0 , . . . , vn ] is in\nX[\u0175 : q\u0302] if and only if i=0 wj (viS\n) < qj for some 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s.\ns\nIt is easy to see X[\u0175 : q\u0302] = j=1 X[wj : qj ]. s is refered to as the weight\ndimension of the quota system.\nIn the appendix, it is shown that every finite simplicial complex is isomorphic to\na vector-valued quota complex X[\u0175 : q\u0302] where the weights and quota can be taken\nto be vectors with positive integer entries.\nIn section 2, the basic topology of quota complexes is studied especially scalarvalued quota complexes. One of the key results is (all the relevant topological\ndefinitions can be found in that section):\nTheorem 1.3. Let X = X[w : q] be a scalar valued quota complex, then X is\nhomotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres. Let v0 be a vertex of minimal weight,\nthen there is one sphere of dimension s in the bouquet for every face F of dimension\ns in X, not containing v0 , such that q \u2212 w(v0 ) \u2264 w(F ) < q.\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 3\n\nIf X is a vector valued quota complex of weight dimension N then X can be\ncovered by N scalar valued quota complexes. As long as X has no \"shell vertices\"\nwe have Cat(X) \u2264 2N \u22121 where Cat(X) denotes the category of the space X. Thus\nCat(X)+1\nprovides a homotopy invariant lower bound on the weight dimension of\n2\nany quota complex for X with no shell vertices.\nThese quota systems are then applied to examples in number theory (for the\nbasic background needed in number theory see for example [A] or [Te]) :\nThe prime complex is the full simplicial complex with vertex set equal to the set\nof primes P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . . }. For a fixed integer q \u2265 3, P rime(q) is the quota\ncomplex on vertex set P and quota q (thus the actual vertex set will be all primes\nless than q and the faces will be collections of such primes whose sum is less than\nq.)\nIn section 3 we study this basic prime complex and show\nTheorem 1.4. Let q = 2k be an even integer \u2265 4, then [q \u2212 2, q) \u2229 Z = {O, E}\nwhere O = 2k \u2212 1, E = 2k \u2212 2 are the unique odd (respectively even) integer in\nthe interval [q \u2212 2, q). Then the prime complex P rime(q) has the homotopy type\nof a bouquet of spheres where there is one j-sphere in the bouquet for every way of\nwriting an element in {O, E} as a sum of j + 1 distinct odd primes.\nThe dimension of the reduced jth homology of P rime(q), dim H\u0304j (P rime(q), Q)\nis equal to the number of ways of writing an element in {O, E} as a sum of j + 1\ndistinct odd primes.\nFor q \u2265 6, P rime(q) is not connected if and only if O = q \u22121 is a prime number.\nFor q \u2265 6, P rime(q) has a non simply-connected component if and only if E =\nq \u2212 2 is a sum of two distinct odd primes.\nThus the Twin Prime Conjecture is equivalent to the statement that P rime(q)\nand P rime(q + 2) are both disconnected complexes for infinitely many values of q.\nThe Goldbach Conjecture is equivalent to the statement that P rime(q) has a non\nsimply connected component for all q \u2265 6, with q not equal to twice an odd prime.\n(The Goldbach conjecture trivially holds for q = 2p, p an odd prime anyway)\nThus while the P rime(q) complex is defined as a natural quota complex with\nvertices the set of primes less than q and faces given by collections of such primes\nwhose sum is less than q, the topology of the complex P rime(q) is carried by the\nsums whose sum lies in the shell [q, q \u2212 2). Hence one can view the statement above\nas a topological form of the sieve method important in number theory.\nIn the section 3 we also include data that shows how Hi (P rime(q)) varies as a\nfunction of q for fixed i. The behaviour observed is similar to that found in the\nstudy of random simplicial complexes (see [Ka]) and to behaviour observed in the\nbirth-death process in the theory of continuous Markov chains (see [LR]).\nIn section 5 we study how another topological quantity namely the Euler characteristic of P rime(q) varies as the quota q is changed. We find\n\u03c7(P rime(q)) = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bc(n)Lq (n)\n\nn=2\n\nwhere \u03bc is the M\u00f6bius function and Lq is a certain characteristic function which\nconverges pointwise to the characteristic function of the square-free integers as\nq \u2192 \u221e. In order to clarify the issue, we introduce the LogPrime quota complex\nwhich is the simplicial complex on the set of primes as vertices but with the weight\n\n\f4\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nof a vertex p being ln(p). We then study how the Euler characteristic of this quota\ncomplex changes with quota and obtain:\nTheorem 1.5. Let LogP rime(q) be the LogPrime complex with quota q > 2. Then\nX\n\u03c7(LogP rime(q)) = \u2212\n\u03bc(n)\n2\u2264n<eq\n\nwhere \u03bc is the M\u00f6bius function. The Riemann hypothesis, that the nontrivial zeros\nof the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, is equivalent to the growth\ncondition |\u03c7(LogP rime(q))| = O(eq(0.5+\u000f) ) for all \u000f > 0. In fact, in this case\nthe reciprocal of the zeta function will equal a certain difference of L-functions\nassociated to \u03c7(LogP rime(q)) for Re(s) > 12 .\nThe substance of this theorem is really due to the work of Titchmarsh (see [Ti])\nwho gave an equivalent statement to the Riemann Hypothesis based on the rate of\ngrowth of Merten's function. However we include it to point out that the problem\nalso can be cast as a question about quota complexes.\nIn section 4 we give data for similar complexes encoding the distribution of integer squares and cubes. For example one can let Square(q) be the simplicial complex\non vertices the positive integer squares less than q and with the faces consisting of\ncollections of positive integer squares whose sum is less than q. Similarly one can\ndefine a complex Cube(q) where cubes replace squares.\nOne then gets similar flavor theorems:\nTheorem 1.6. If Square(q) is the square complex, then Square(q) is homotopy\nequivalent to a bouquet of spheres and dim(H\u0304j (Square(q))) is equal to the number\nof ways to write q \u2212 1 as a sum of j + 1 distinct positive integer squares > 1. Thus\nSquare(q), q \u2265 3, is connected if and only if q \u2212 1 is not a positive integer square.\nIt is simply connected if and only if q \u2212 1 is not a positive integer square or the sum\nof two distinct positive integer squares > 1.\nIf Cube(q) is the cube complex, then dim(H\u0304j (Cube(q))) is equal to the number\nof ways to write q \u2212 1 as a sum of j + 1 distinct positive integer cubes > 1.\nThus the change in the homology of these complexes as quota is varied encodes\nvarious Waring type problems.\nData describing the growth of Hi for these two complexes as a function of q is\nalso presented in that section.\nAs a final arithmetical application, in section 6 we define for any integer n \u2265 2,\nthe divisor complex Div(n) whose vertices consist of the proper positive integer\ndivisors of n and whose faces consist of collections of such divisors whose sum is\nless than n. (Hence we are using quota n). This complex encodes the distribution\nof the divisors of n, keeping track of which collections of divisors have sums less\nthan n or greater or equal to n.\nRecall an integer n \u2265 2 is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less\nthan n, perfect if the sum of its proper divisors is equal to n, and abundant if the\nthe sum of its proper divisors is greater than n. We obtain the following theorem:\nTheorem 1.7. For any n \u2265 2, Div(n) is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of\nspheres where there is one j-sphere for every collection of j + 1 proper divisors of\nn, not including 1 which sum to n \u2212 1.\nThus if n is deficient, Div(n) is contractible.\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 5\n\nThus n is perfect if and only if Div(n) is homotopic to a sphere of dimension\n\u03c4 (n) \u2212 3 where \u03c4 (n) is the number of positive integer divisors of n.\nThe complex Div(n) in the case that n is abundant can be relatively complicated.\nData is presented in section 6 which shows an example of an odd number whose\ncomplex Div(n) is spherical and of dimension close to \u03c4 (n) \u2212 3 but not equal. This\nodd number is \"close\" to being an odd perfect number in a topological sense; of\ncourse the existence of an actual odd perfect number is still open. Even perfect\nnumbers are in bijective correspondence with Mersenne primes and it is an open\nquestion whether there are infinitely many of these.\nIn section 7, a generating function for Euler characteristics of quota complexes is\nfound and a quota-complex formulation of Lehmer's conjecture is provided among\nother things.\nIn the final section, we consider a finite set of independent continuous random\nvariables X1 , . . . XN with continuous density functions fi with compact support in\n[m, \u221e) where m > 0. We examine the random quota complex associated to these\nrandom variables with fixed minimal weight X0 = m and quota q > m > 0.

Topology of quota complexes\nIn this section we discuss the topological results for scalar quota complexes. For\nthe basic background needed in this section see [H] or [Mu]. The reader more\ninterested in applications to number theoretic examples can skim the statements of\ntheorems and move on to the application sections of the paper.\nFirst we recall some elementary definitions for simplicial complexes.\n\n\f6\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nDefinition 2.1. Let X be a simplicial complex and let v be a vertex in X. The\n \u0304\nclosed star of v, St(v)\nis the union of all faces in X that contain v. The open star of\nv, St(v) is the union of the interior of all faces in X that contain v. The link of v is\n \u0304\ndefined as Lk(v) = St(v)\n\u2212 St(v). Thus Lk(v) consists of all faces F = [v0 , . . . , vk ]\nin X not containing v such that [v0 , . . . , vk , v] is also a face of X.\n \u0304\nThe open star St(v) is an open neighborhood of v in X, the closed star St(v)\nis\nits closure and Lk(v) is its boundary in X.\nThe topological structure of a scalar valued quota complex is controlled to a large\ndegree by the part of the complex outside the closed star of a vertex of minimal\nweight as the next theorem illustrates:\nProposition 2.2. Let X be a scalar weighted finite simplicial complex. Let vmin\n \u0304 min ) then the\nbe a vertex of minimal weight. If F is a face of X that is not in St(v\n \u0304\nboundary of F is completely contained in Lk(vmin ) \u2282 St(vmin ).\nFurthermore F is such a face if and only if F does not contain vmin and q \u2212\nw(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q.\nProof. If V is the vertex set of X, w : V \u2192 R+ the weight function and q > 0 the\nPk\nquota then [v0 , . . . , vk ] is a k-face of X if and only if i=0 w(vi ) < q. Let vmin be\na vertex of minimal weight which exists as V is finite.\nNote that if F = [v0 , . . . , vk ] is a face of X not contained in the closed star of vmin\nthen vmin \u2208\n/ F and w(F ) < q as F is a face of X. Furthermore, [v0 , . . . , vk , vmin ]\n \u0304 min ) and hence F being a face\ncannot be a face in X as if not it would be in St(v\n \u0304\nof [v0 , . . . , vk , vmin ] would also be in St(vmin ). Thus w(F ) + w(vmin ) \u2265 q. Putting\nthe inequalities together gives q \u2212 w(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q. Conversely, reversing\nthe argument, it is easily checked that any face F of X not containing vmin and\nsatisfying these final inequalities is not in the closed star of vmin .\nLet F = [v0 , . . . vk ] and let \u03c3 = [v0 , . . . , v\u0302i , . . . , vk ] be a face in the boundary\nof F obtained by removing the ith vertex. Note that w(\u03c3) = w(F ) \u2212 w(vi ) \u2264\nw(F ) \u2212 w(vmin ) and so w([\u03c3, vmin ]) = w(\u03c3) + w(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q and so [\u03c3, vmin ]\n \u0304 min ) as desired.\nis a face in X and so \u03c3 \u2286 Lk(vmin ) \u2282 St(v\n \u0304 min ) as\nThus the boundary of F is completely contained in Lk(vmin ) \u2282 St(v\ndesired.\n\u0003\nFor the next theorem, we recall the basic fact that if A is a contractible subcomplex of a CW or simplicial complex X then the quotient map \u03c0 : X \u2192 X/A which\ncollapses A to a point is a homotopy equivalence. However even if A and X are\nsimplicial complexes, the collapsed space X/A is only a CW -complex in general.\nWe will apply this fact to the case of a finite scalar quota complex X where A\nwill be the closed star of a minimal weight vertex. Closed and open stars of a vertex\nv are always contractible as they are star-convex with respect to the vertex v.\nIn this context, it is important to note that if F = [v0 , . . . , vk ] is a k-face of\nX then the space F/\u2202F obtained by collapsing the boundary of F to a point is\nhomeomorphic to a k-sphere S k i.e., the space of unit vectors in Rk+1 . Recall that\na bouquet of spheres is the wedge product of a collection of spheres (not necessarily\nof the same dimension and the 0-sphere is allowed). Intuitively this is a collection\nof spheres attached at a common point.\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 7\n\nTheorem 2.3 (Scalar quota complexes are homotopy equivalent to bouquets of\n \u0304 min ) be the\nspheres). Let X be a finite scalar quota complex and let A = St(v\nclosed star of a vertex of minimal weight. Then the quotient map \u03c0 : X \u2192 X/A\nis a homotopy equivalence and X/A is a bouquet of spheres where there is one isphere for each i-face F = [v0 , . . . , vi ] in X not containing vmin and such that\nq \u2212 w(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q.\nThus the reduced integer homology groups of X, H\u0304i (X) are free abelian groups\nof finite rank equal to the number of i-faces F of X, not containing vmin with\nq \u2212 w(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q.\nProof. The fact that the collapse map \u03c0 : X \u2192 X/A is a homotopy equivalence\nwas explained in the paragraphs before the statement of the theorem. Any face of\n \u0304 min ) maps to the collapse basepoint A/A in X/A.\nX inside A = St(v\nBy proposition 2.2, the i-faces F of X not contained in A are exactly the i-faces\nF not containing vmin with q \u2212 w(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q and such a face maps to an\ni-sphere F/\u2202F = S i in X/A. From this it is easy to see that X/A is a bouquet of\nspheres as claimed.\nThe comment on reduced integer homology follows immediately from basic facts\nabout homology.\n\u0003\nNote Theorem 2.3 is a sort of topological sieve in the sense that it says the\ninteresting topology of a scalar quota complex is carried by the \"shell faces\" i.e.\nthe faces F with q \u2212 w(vmin ) \u2264 w(F ) < q so that their weight is concentrated in a\nnarrow shell near the quota q.\nAs we will not use vector-weighted quota complexes in the applications of the rest\nof the paper, the theorems and proofs about the vector-weighted case are deferred\nto Appendix A. The reader is also referred to Appendix B, for the proof that every\nfinite simplicial complex is isomorphic to a (vector weighted) quota complex. Thus\nfor example, every closed manifold is homeomorphic to some vector weighted quota\ncomplex. The picture for vector weighted quota complexes is much less complete\nthan that for scalar weighted quota complexes. In the applications in the rest of\nthe paper, scalar weighted quota complexes are used predominantly because their\ntopological structure is completely determined up to homotopy by the results of\nthis section.\n3. Application: The Prime Complex and the Goldbach conjecture\nIn the current and following sections we examine three examples of scalar quota\ncomplexes that arise from sequences of increasing positive integers V = {vn }\u221e\nn=1 .\nIn general, for integers q > v1 we take V (q) to be the quota complex on the vertex\nset V with quota q. As described in section 2 the topology of V (q) is entirely\ndetermined by the number of ways to add integers vn \u2208 V , where v1 6= vn < q,\nso that the sum falls in the interval [q \u2212 v1 , q). So V (q) topologically encodes the\nnumber of ways to express integers in [q \u2212 v1 , q) as sums of distinct elements in\nV \u2212 {v1 }. Our main interest is in describing the behavior of V (q) as q is increased\nfor the cases where V is the set of primes, squares and cubes.\nOur description of V (q) will be data-based and will center on the functions hi (q)\nand si (q), where hi (q) = dim(H\u0304i (V (q)),\ni-simplexes in\n\b Q) and si (q) is the number ofP\nV (q) not containing v1 . So si (q) = U \u2282 V \u2212 {v1 } : |U | = i + 1, v\u2208U v < q\nand hi (q) = si (q) \u2212 si (q \u2212 v1 ) by Theorem 2.3. Furthermore note that for i > 0,\n\n\f8\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nsi (q) + si\u22121 (q \u2212 v1 ) is the number of i-simplexes in V (q) and of course s0 (q) + 1\nis the number of zero simplexes. In order to capture the relative growth of these\nvalues we will examine the ratios:\nsi (q)\nhi (q)\nSi (q) = P\nand Hi (q) = P\n.\ns\n(q)\nj j\nj hj (q)\nNote of course that 0 \u2264 Si (q), Hi (q) \u2264 1 count the fraction of the cells (respectively\nhomology) of the quota complex V (q) that are concentrated in dimension i.\nBefore describing the data, which was produced with a purpose-built algorithm\nin C++, we first develop a simple theoretical context. Let \u03ba > 0 be an integer and\nsuppose there is a monotonically increasing, differentiable function f : [\u03ba, \u221e) \u2192\nR, with limx\u2192\u221e f (x) = \u221e and such that s0 (q) \u223c f (q), by which we mean that\nlimq\u2192\u221e s0 (q)/f (q) = 1. Such a function f will be called an interpolating function\nfor the vertex count function s0 (q).\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(x)\nSet sbi (x) = fi+1\n, where we are thinking of xk as the degree k polynomial\nx(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 2) * * * (x \u2212 k + 1)/k!. So certainly sbi (x) \u223c f (x)i+1 /(i + 1)!. We make\nthe approximation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\ns0 (dq/(i + 1)e)\ns0 (q)\nsbi (q/(i + 1)) \u223c\n\u2264 si (q) \u2264\n\u223c sbi (q).\ni+1\ni+1\n\u0001\n0 (q)\nThis comes from noting that si+1\nis the number of potential i-simplices in the\ncomplex that one can make out of the s0 (q) vertices other than v1 and hence\n\u0001\ncertainly bounds si (q) from above. On the other hand, s0 (dq/(i+1)e)\nis the number\ni+1\nof i-simplices possible that one can make out of vertices other than v1 but with\nq\n; such simplices definitely are below quota and hence definitely\nweight below i+1\ncount towards si (q).\nIn this setup, various general expectations can be derived for the functions Si (q)\nand Hi (q). The expectations and their proofs are collected in proposition C.1 in\nAppendix C. It is shown there that {Si : Z \u2192 [0, 1] | i = 0, 1, 2, . . . } should be a\nfamily of unimodal functions of q, each with a single local maximum which moves\nto the right as i increases and such that the heights of the maxima decrease towards\n0 as i \u2192 \u221e. All of these expectations are realized in the data.\nIn the primes quota complex (v1 = 2) the data indicates that the family of\nfunctions Hi (q) has the same global behavior as Si (q), whereas in the squares and\ncubes cases (v1 = 1), Hi (q) has no discernible shape outside of appearing to tend\nto zero as q \u2192 \u221e.\nWe now consider the case V = P = {2, 3, 5, * * * }, the set of primes, and its quota\ncomplex P rime(q). For this vertex set we will denote the corresponding simplex\nand homology functions discussed above with a superscript P , so for example sP\ni (q)\nis the number of i-simplexes in P rime(q) not containing 2. Note that in this case\nsP\n0 (q) = \u03c0(q \u2212 1) \u2212 1, where \u03c0 is the prime number counting function.\nRecall that the prime number theorem says \u03c0(q) \u223c fP (q) where fP (x) = x/ ln x.\nCertainly fP : [3, \u221e) \u2192 R has the required properties to be an interpolating\nfunction, so we expect SiP (q) to have the behavior described above, at least for\ni \u2265 3. Our data was generated using the first 100 odd primes (so the primes 3\nthrough 547), producing complete information in the range 0 < q \u2264 550 and up\nto homology dimension 16. Figure 1a shows SiP (q) versus q for 0 < q \u2264 550 and\ncell-dimensions 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6; here our global expectations are closely exhibited: SiP (q)\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 9\n\n(a) SiP (q), 0 < q \u2264 550, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6\n\nP\n(b) Si,ave\n(q), 0 < q \u2264 550, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6\n\n(c) HiP (q), 0 < q \u2264 550, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6\n\nP\n(q), 0 < q \u2264 550, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6\n(d) Hi,ave\n\nFigure 1.

Figure 1b is a smoothing of SiP (q), showing the\nq\n1\nP\nquantity Si,ave (q) = q k=1 SiP (k). The \"double-line\" effect evident in figure 1a\noccurs because we are summing odd numbers, so depending on the length of the\nsum only odd or even sums occur in each dimension.\nAs described in the introduction, the homology data of P rime(q) encodes several\nclassical arithmetic conjectures in number theory. In particular if hP\n1 (q) > 0 for all\nq > 8 then the Goldbach conjecture holds, in fact in this case a stronger refinement\nof Goldbach holds, namely that every even number greater than or equal to 8 is the\nsum of two distinct odd primes. Our data is consistent with the stronger refinement\nof Goldbach and thus we conjecture:\nConjecture 3.1. dim(H1 (P rime(q), Q)) 6= 0 for all q > 8.\nEquivalently, every even number q \u2265 8 is a sum of exactly two distinct odd\nprimes.\nThe classical Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the above conjecture holding\nfor all even numbers greater than 3 and not equal to twice a prime. (The Goldbach\nconjecture is trivial for even numbers equal to twice a prime anyway.)\nFigure 1c shows HiP (q) for 0 < q \u2264 550 and 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6. Although appearing fairly\nscattered below q \u2248 100 in these dimensions, the same global behavior as SiP (q)\nmanifests fairly rapidly as q increases. As before, we also provide a smoothing of\nthe data in figure 1d.\n\n\f10\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\u00011/(i+1)\nln(q), 0 < q \u2264 550, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6\nsP\ni (q)\n\nIn general, the quantities hP\ni (q) count the ways to sum to even or odd positive\nintegers using i + 1 distinct odd primes. Specifically if hP\ni (q) > 0 for all sufficiently\nlarge q and i + 1 is even/odd, then all sufficiently large positive even/odd integers\nare expressible as a sum of distinct odd primes. At i = 2 this is a refinement of the\nweak Goldbach conjecture that all odd numbers greater than 7 are a sum of three\nodd primes. The weak Goldbach conjecture has been shown to hold for almost all\nodd numbers by Vinogradav.\nIn our data hP\n2 (q) > 0 for 20 \u2264 q \u2264 550 and so it is reasonable to conjecture:\nConjecture 3.2. dim(H2 (P rime(q), Q)) 6= 0 for all q \u2265 20.\nEquivalently, every odd number q \u2265 19 is a sum of exactly three distinct odd\nprimes.\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the data is displayed in figure 2. Here, in\na naive attempt to capture the expected asymptotic growth of sP\ni (q), we graph\n\u00011/(i+1)\nP\nsi (q)\nln(q) versus q for 0 < q \u2264 550 and 0 \u2264 i \u2264 6. In this range the\ndata displays strong linearity. The data line with slope nearly one is the line for\nthe zero-simplexes, the data line with the next greatest slope is the one-simplexes,\ni+1\nand so-on. Note that since sbi (q) \u223c fP (q)i+1 /(i + 1)! = ln(q)qi+1 (i+1)! by the prime\nq\n) \u2264 si (q) \u2264 sbi (q), heuristically one might expect lines\nnumber theorem and sbi ( i+1\n\u0001\n1/(i+1)\nP\nwhen plotting si (q)\nln q versus q with slopes roughly somewhere between\n((i+1)!)\u22121/(i+1)\ni+1\n\nand ((i + 1)!)\u22121/(i+1) . Running a least squares approximation on the\ndata gives slopes of 0.632374 when i = 1; 0.404613 when i = 2; 0.284124 when\ni = 3; 0.211868 when i = 4; 0.164796 when i = 5; and 0.132366 when i = 6. These\nvalues are consistent with the heuristics. Thus it is reasonable to conjecture:\nConjecture 3.3. Let sP\ni (q) denote the number of sets of i + 1 distinct odd primes\nwhose sum is below q.

Application: Euler characteristics, the M\u00f6bius function and the\nRiemann Hypothesis\nIn Section 3 we looked at the topology of the Prime complex P rime(q) as the\nquota q was varied. In this section we go back to that complex and consider the\nvariance of another topological quantity, the Euler characteristic, of this complex\nas the quota q changes.\nRecall for a finite cell complex X, the Euler characteristic of X, \u03c7(X), can\nbe defined as anP\nalternating sum of the number of cells of various dimensions.\n\u221e\nNamely, \u03c7(X) = j=0 (\u22121)j cj \u2208 Z where cj is the number of j-cells in the complex\nX. Recall that the Euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant, i.e., homotopy\nequivalent spaces have the same Euler characteristic.\nLet us first consider, the unrestricted P rime complex where q = \u221e. This is an\ninfinite dimensional simplex, but let us write down an (infinite) expression for its\nEuler characteristic. When restricted to the finite quota complexes P rime(q), we\nwill then get finite sum expressions for their Euler characteristic.\nRecall the j-dimensional faces of the prime complex are in bijective correspondence with finite sets of j + 1 distinct primes. Such a finite set of primes can be\nuniquely associated to its product by the unique factorization of integers. Thus\nthe faces of the prime complex are in bijective correspondence with the squarefree integers > 1. (Recall an integer is square-free if no prime is repeated in its\nfactorization).\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 13\n\nRecall the M\u00f6bius function \u03bc : N \u2192 {\u22121, 0, 1} is given by\n(\n(\u22121) number of prime factors of n if n is square-free\n\u03bc(n) =\n0 if n is not square-free\nNow note that for a j-cell of the prime complex, the corresponding square-free\nnumber n will have j + 1 distinct prime factors and so \u03bc(n) = (\u22121)j+1 = \u2212(\u22121)j .\nIt is now easy to see that formally one has:\n\u03c7(P rime) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)j cj = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bc(n)\n\nn=2\n\nj=0\n\nTo get the corresponding finite sum expression for \u03c7(P rime(q)) we need to include the quota restriction which will allow only a finite number of the cells to be\nin P rime(q). Well notice a j-face [p0 , p1 , . . . , pj ] lies in P rime(q) if and only if\nPj\ni=0 pi < q. Let us define Lq : N \u2192 {0, 1} by\n(\n1 if n is square-free and the sum of its prime divisors is less than q\nLq (n) =\n0 otherwise\nNote that Lq (n) = 0 for sufficiently large n as there are only finitely many primes\nless than q and finitely many square-free numbers with only those prime factors.\nThen we have proven:\nProposition 5.1 (Euler characteristic of the Prime complex). Let q > 2 and\nP rime(q) be the prime complex with quota q. Then\n\u03c7(P rime(q)) = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bc(n)Lq (n)\n\nn=2\n\nand this sum is finite.\nNote that as q \u2192 \u221e, Lq converges pointwise to the characteristic function of the\nset of square-free integers.\nIn the data the Euler characteristic of P rime(q) behaves very regularly as q\nincreases. Figure 5 displays the Euler characteristic for quotas 0 < q \u2264 550.\nWe will see in section 7 (example 3) that the growth of \u03c7(P rime(q)) with q is\nsubexponential.\nIn analytic number theory, one defines Merten's function\nM (N ) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bc(n).\n\nn=1\n\nBy work of Titchmarsh it is known that the Riemann hypothesis that the nontrivial\nzeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line is equivalent to the\nstatement that M (N ) = O(N 0.5+\u000f ) for all \u000f > 0. In other words, for every \u000f > 0,\nthere exists a constant C = C(\u000f) > 0 such that\nM (N ) \u2264 CN 0.5+\u000f\nfor all N large enough.\nWith this in mind we introduce a the LogP rime complex which is the full quota\ncomplex (q = \u221e) with vertices the set of primes where the weight of the vertex p\n\n\f14\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nFigure 5. \u03c7(P rime(q)), 0 < q \u2264 550\nis ln(p). Thus as a simplicial complex LogP rime = P rime but LogP rime(q) 6=\nP rime(q) for most finite quotas q.\nThe j-dimensional faces of LogP rime are still in bijective correspondence with\nthe square-free integers with j +1 prime factors. We need only consider the effect of\nimposing quota q with the new weights. Note [p0 , . . . , pj ] is a face of LogP rime(q)\nPj\nif and only if i=0 ln(pi ) < q. If n is the square-free number corresponding to the\nface then this is equivalent to ln(n) < q or n < eq .\nFrom this one easily deduces:\nTheorem 5.2 (Euler characteristic of the LogPrime complex). Let LogP rime(q)\nbe the LogPrime complex with quota q > 2. Then\nX\n\u03c7(LogP rime(q)) = \u2212\n\u03bc(n)\n2\u2264n<eq\n\nIf we set q = ln(N + 1) then\n\u03c7(LogP rime(q)) = \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bc(n) = 1 \u2212 M (N )\n\nn=2\n\nand so\n|\u03c7(LogP rime(q))| = O(N 0.5+\u000f ) = O(eq(0.5+\u000f) )\nfor all \u000f > 0 if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis is true. Equivalently, for any\n\u000f > 0, there is a constant C = C(\u000f) > 0 such that\nln(|\u03c7(LogP rime(q))|) \u2264 (0.5 + \u000f)q + ln(C(\u000f))\nfor all q large enough.\nFigure 6 shows the natural logarithm of the magnitude of the Euler characteristic\nof 6276 of the LogP rime(q) complexes in the range 7 \u2264 q \u2264 16.5554. This data,\nwhich was generated using the first 106 odd primes, clearly displays the behavior\nexpected by the Riemann Hypothesis, namely most data points occur below a line\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 15\n\nof slope roughly 1/2. Note also that by comparing this data with that for the\nP rime complex it is clear that Lq (n) has a strongly regularizing effect.\n\nFigure 6. ln(|\u03c7(LogP rime(q))|), 7 \u2264 q \u2264 16.5554\nFrom the last theorem, we see that a thorough understanding of how the Euler\ncharacteristic of the LogPrime complex varies with quota q is equivalent to the\nRiemann hypothesis. In fact one direction of the above theorem can be made very\nP\u221e\nP\u221e M (n)\u2212M (n\u22121)\nP\u221e\n1\nexplicit. As \u03b6(s)\n= n=1 \u03bc(n)\n= n=1 \u03c7(LogP rime(ln(n)))\n\u2212\nn=1\nns =\nns\nns\nP\u221e \u03c7(LogP rime(ln(n+1)))\nfor all Re(s) > 2, we see that if the bounds mentioned in\nn=1\nns\nTheorem 5.2 hold, the final two L-series would converge for Re(s) > 21 and provide\n1\nan analytic continuation of \u03b6(s)\nto Re(s) > 12 , hence showing that \u03b6(s) has no zeros\nfor Re(s) > 12 which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.\nIt would be nice to have a similar characterization of the Riemann Hypothesis\nusing the Prime complex itself. As the prime number theorem, twin prime conjecture and Goldbach conjecture have topological characterizations using the Prime\ncomplex, it iseems likely the Riemann Hypothesis does also but we do not know of\nany such clean statement currently. However section 7 addresses this further.\n6. Application: The Divisor Complex, perfect, deficient and\nabundant numbers\nRecall that a positive integer is perfect/deficient/abundant if the sum of its\nproper positive divisors is equal/less/more than itself.\nConsider the divisor complex Div(n) for n \u2265 2. This is the scalar quota complex\nwith vertex set the set of proper positive integer divisors of n and quota n. So,\nsince the minimal vertex has weight 1, Div(n) is homotopic to a bouquet of spheres,\nconsisting of one sphere of dimension i for each way n\u22121 can be written as a sum of\ni+1 distinct non-unit divisors of n. In particular, as stated in the introduction, n is\nperfect if and only if Div(n) is homotopic to a sphere of dimension \u03c4 (n) \u2212 3, where\n\n\f16\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\n\u03c4 (n) is the number of positive integer divisors of n. Note that Div(n) does not fit\ninto the simple framework developed in section 3 since as the quota n increases the\nvertex set of Div(n) changes completely. By the Euclid-Euler theorem, there is a\nbijective correspondence between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes i.e.,\nprimes of the form 2p \u2212 1. More specifically a Mersenne prime 2p \u2212 1 is associated\nto even perfect number 2p\u22121 (2p \u2212 1). It is unknown if there are infinitely many\nMersenne primes (and hence infinitely many even perfect numbers). As of 2010,\nthere were 47 known Mersenne primes. It is also unknown if there are any odd\nperfect numbers.\nFigure 7 displays Div(n) for 2 \u2264 n < 12384. The data was generated by a\npurpose-built algorithm in C++. The horizontal axis measures n and the vertical\naxis measures topological dimension. Non-contractible complexes are represented\nas solid vertical lines with height equal to the maximal dimension of a sphere in the\nbouquet; the spheres themselves are plotted as white squares along the vertical line\nat height equal to their dimension with spheres of the same dimension being listed\nhorizontally. Also, a data point at (n, \u03c4 (n) \u2212 3) is included for each n with Div(n)\nnon-contractible, together with a dashed line connecting it to a highest dimensional\nsphere in Div(n). So perfect numbers can be identified as those vertical lines with\n\nFigure 7. Div(n)\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 17\n\nno dashed component. In this range there are four perfect numbers, 6, 28, 496 and\n8128, though due to the scale of the graph only 8128 is clearly visible.\nOne may think of a number n with Div(n) non-contractible as being topologically\nperfect; from this perspective the length of the dashed lines in figure 7 measure how\nclose a topologically perfect number is to being perfect in the classical sense. The\nlast non-contractible divisor complex plotted in figure 7 is particularly interesting\nin this light as it occurs at the odd number n = 12285 and is only a distance of\ntwo divisors away from being perfect. A simple check with the data-generating\nalgorithm showed that n = 12285 is the only topologically perfect odd number in\nthe range 2 \u2264 n \u2264 106 . In general of course it is not known if odd perfect numbers\nexist.\n7. Combinatorics of Euler characteristics and Lehmer's Conjecture\nIn this section, we use the simple combinatorial nature of the Euler characteristic\nto explicitly connect the Euler characteristics of various basic quota systems with\nwell-known combinatorics. We will work with formal power series but state radii\nof convergence when reasonable without proof (the proofs are elementary).\nFor the general setup let 1 \u2264 \u03bd1 \u2264 \u03bd2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03bdi \u2264 . . . be a sequence of\nnondecreasing positive integers with the property that only finitely many of them\nlie below any given N > 0.\nIt is easy to check that we have an identity of formal power series:\n\u221e\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 x\u03bdi ) = 1 +\n\ni=2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nC j xj\n\nj=\u03bd2\n\nwhere\nCj =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n Dn,j = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n Dn+1,j\n\nn=0\n\nn=1\n\nand Dn,j is the number of n-fold sums of \u03bdi , i 6= 1 with distinct indices, which\nsum to j. (We define Cj = 0 for j < \u03bd2 also.) If X(q) denotes the corresponding\nscalar quota complex with quota q > \u03bd1 and \u03c7[q] its Euler chacteristic then by\nTheorem 2.3, we have \u03c7[q] = 1 \u2212 Cq\u22121 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Cq\u2212\u03bd1 or equivalently 1 \u2212 \u03c7[q] =\nP\nq\u2212\u03bd1 \u2264i<q Ci .

Using the geometric series formula\nwe can simplify to get:\n\u221e\n\u221e\nY\nX\n(1 \u2212 x\u03bdi ) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)\n\u03c7[j + 1]xj .\ni=1\n\nj=\u03bd1\n\nWe summarize our results:\nTheorem 7.1 (Generating function for Euler characteristics).

This is because on expanding the\nproduct on the left hand side of the first equation, the first nonzero term determines\nboth the lowest weight and its multiplicity by comparison with the right hand side\nof the equation. Once this is known, one can divide through by the corresponding\nfactor(s) and determine the 2nd lowest weight with its multiplicity and proceeding\nin this manner, recursively recover the full weight system.\nExample 1: Counting complex. Let \u03bdi = i for all i \u2265 1. Then the corresponding\nquota complex will be denoted Count(q). We then have\n\u221e\n\u221e\nY\nX\nj\n(1 \u2212 xn ) = \u03c6(x)\n\u03c7(Count(j + 1))x =\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)\nn=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) is called Euler's function (not to be confused with the Euler totient\nfunction). In this case the fomal P\nseries and product converge for complex numbers\n\u221e\n1\nx with |x| < 1. In fact \u03c6(x)\n= n=1 p(n)xn where p(n) is the number of partitions of n. Furthermore writing x = e2\u03c0iz makes \u03c6(z) an analytic function on the\nupper half of the complex plane which turns out to be a modular form. In fact\n\u22121\n\u03c6(x) = x 24 \u03b7(z) where \u03b7 is the Dedekind eta function.\nExample 2: Count(24) and Lehmer's conjecture. Let us take the union of 24 copies\nof the previous example, thus the weights will be the positive integers but there\nwill be 24 vertices for every given weight. We will denote the corresponding quota\ncomplex by Count(24) (q). Then\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nY\nX\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)\n\u03c7(Count(24) (j + 1))xj =\n(1 \u2212 xn )24 =\n\u03c4 (n + 1)xn\nj=1\n\nn=1\n\nn=0\n\nwhere \u03c4 (n) is Ramanujan's Tau function. From this it is easy to see that Lehmer's\nconjecture that \u03c4 (n) 6= 0 for all n \u2265 1 is equivalent to\n\u03c7(Count(24) (m)) 6= \u03c7(Count(24) (m + 1))\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 19\n\nfor all m \u2265 2.\nExample 3: P rime complex. Let \u03bdi be the ith prime. The corresponding quota\ncomplex is just P rime(q) the prime complex considered in earlier sections. We have\nQ\n\u221e\nX\n1 \u2212 p prime (1 \u2212 xp )\nq\n\u03c7(P rime(q + 1))x =\n.\n1\u2212x\nq=2\nThe formal power series and product converge for complex numbers x with |x| < 1\nbut the sum diverges at x = 1 and the product diverges at x = \u22121 for example.\nThey define analytic functions in the open unit disk and hence on the upper half\nplane. The fact that the radius of convergence is 1 shows that the growth of\n\u03c7(P rime(q)) with q is subexponential i.e., \u03c7(P rime(q)) = o(Aq ) for any A > 1.\n8. Random Quota Complexes\nIn this section we consider the topology of a random quota complex. For the\nbasic facts about probability used in this section see [B] and for the basic facts\nabout Fourier transforms see [Ho].\nFix X0 = m > 0 a (nonrandom) value. Let X1 , . . . , XN be independent random\nvariables. Furthermore assume Xi are continuous random variables with continuous\ndensity function fi with compact support in [m, \u221e) for all i \u2265 1. Fix a quota\nq > m. Since we assume the densities are continuous with compact support, fi \u2208\nL1 (R) \u2229 L2 (R) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and we will hence be able to use convolutions, Fourier\ntransforms and the inverse Fourier transform without technical difficulties. We will\ndo so without further mention. Note one can consider the density for X0 = m as the\ndelta measure centered at m but while this has a well-defined Fourier transform, the\ninverse transform formula is singular and we will worry about this when necessary.\nDefinition 8.1 (Random scalar quota complex). Let X = {X0 = m, X1 , . . . , XN }\nbe chosen as in the previous paragraph and q > m > 0. X[q] is the quota complex\non vertices {0, 1, 2, . . . , N } with weights w(i) = Xi and quota q.\nX[q] is called a random scalar quota complex. On any run of the experiment, the\nweights will take on specific values and X[q] will determine a specific scalar quota\ncomplex. Thus X[q] can be viewed as a random variable on the sample space of\nthe underlying experiment which takes values in the set of finite abstract simplicial\ncomplexes.\nBy Theorem 2.3, we see immediately that dim(H\u0304j (X[q], Q)) is an integer valued\nrandom variable whose value is the number of (j + 1)-fold sums of the variables\nX1 , . . . , XN (repeats not allowed) that lie in the interval [q \u2212 m, q). The number of\nj-dimensional faces of X[q] is another integer random variable whose value is the\nnumber of (j + 1)-fold sums of the variables X0 , . . . , XN (repeats not allowed) that\nare below quota q. Note that as each random variable takes values greater than or\nequal to m > 0, there will be no j-faces when q \u2264 (j + 1)m and so the dimension\nq\n\u2212 1.\nof X[q] is bounded by m\nP\nLet J \u2286 {1, . . . , N } have |J| = j and let XJ = i\u2208J Xi be the corresponding\nj-fold sum.\nLet us form a Bernoulli indicator random variable:\n(\n1 if XJ \u2208 [q \u2212 m, q)\nBJ =\n0 otherwise\n\n\f20\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nThen calculating expected values we see:\nE[BJ ] = P r(XJ \u2208 [q \u2212 m, q))\nand so to figure out this expectation, we need to determine the distribution for the\ncorresponding sum XJ . This is standard but we include a quick exposition here:\nDefinition 8.2. Let f, g \u2208 L1 (R) then we define the convolution\nZ \u221e\n(f ? g)(\u03b1) =\nf (\u03b1 \u2212 x)g(x)dx\n\u2212\u221e\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 R. It is well known that f ? g \u2208 L1 (R) and indeed ||f ? g||1 \u2264 ||f ||1 ||g||1 .\n(L1 (R), ?) forms a commutative Banach algebra.\nDefinition 8.3. Let f be a continuous density function for a real random variable\nX. The cumulative density function F is defined as\nZ \u03b1\nF (\u03b1) = P r(X \u2264 \u03b1) =\nf (x)dx\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand so we have F 0 (\u03b1) = f (\u03b1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 R.\nThe relevant proposition is:\nProposition 8.4. Let X and Y be independent continuous real valued random\nvariables with continuous density functions fX , fY respectively and cumulative density functions FX , FY respectively. Then FX+Y = FX ? fY and fX+Y = fX ? fY .\nProof.

This is the L-series associated\nto the constant function with value 1 (as the numerators are all 1's).

Consider \"random\" variables X0 = ln(2), X1 = ln(3), X2 =\nln(5), . . . which are just constant at the log-prime values. The corresponding density functions are delta measures centered at the corresponding log-primes and the\ncorresponding \"random\" complex is just the LogPrime complex. We will apply\nTheorem 8.6 to this scenario. If the reader is worried about the the fact that\nthe density functions fi are not continuous with compact support, just replace the\ndelta measures with very small continuous bumps of mass 1 and compact support\nlocalized around these log-primes.

Concluding Remarks\nWe have seen the standard Morse theoretic problem of studying the change of\ntopology of a space as a parameter is varied can be applied to the study of quota\ncomplexes as the quota is varied. In this case the quota determines the complex\nthrough a set of linear inequalities. A similar though more difficult nonlinear version\nof this problem is encountered in the study of random data sets through the method\nof persistant homology.\nIn this context a finite set of data points in Rn is studied by considering the\nspace X[r] consisting of the union of open balls of radius r around these points.\nThe topology of X[r] changes from being discrete when r is very small to a single\ncontractible blob when r is very large. Usually r is varied in a range corresponding\nto reasonable error estimates for the experiment and the persistant features of the\ntopology of X[r] as r ranges over this error interval are looked for and attributed\nas features of the data set.\n\n\f24\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nIn this context one often forms the associated Vietoris-Rips complex instead of\nthe actual space X[r] for computational simplicity. This is an abstract simplicial\ncomplex where there is one vertex for each of the original data points and where\n[v0 , . . . , vn ] is a face if and only if the radius r balls around the vi have pairwise\nnonempty intersection. This is equivalent to D(v0 , . . . , vn ) = supi,j |vi \u2212 vj | < 2r.\nThus instead of the linear inequalities present in scalar quota complexes, these\ninequalities are nonlinear ones saying the diameters of various sets should be below\nquota q = 2r. In these cases, one has to do more work to study the change of\ntopology as for example Theorem 2.3 does not apply.\nPlease see [Ka] for more details. We will not pursue this here.\n\nAppendix A. Vector-weighted quota complexes.\nIn order to state topological structure results about vector weighted quota complexes, we need to recall the definition of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of\na space.\nDefinition A.1. Let X be a topological space. Let n be a nonnegative integer. We\nsay that Cat(X) \u2264 n if X can be covered by n + 1 open sets U0 , . . . , Un such that\neach Ui is contractible in X, i.e., the inclusion map ji : Ui \u2192 X is homotopically\ntrivial.\nThe category of a space is hence either a nonnegative integer or infinite. Note\nCat(X) = 0 if and only if X is contractible. Cat(X) is a homotopy invariant of X\ni.e., homotopy equivalent spaces have the same category.\nThe notion of category was introduced to give a lower bound on the number\nof critical points of a Morse function on a smooth manifold. It has also proved\nfruitful in proving bounds on degrees of nilpotence of various algebraic structures\nassociated to a space X. (See [PY] for example.)\nNote any closed n-manifold can be covered by a finite number of open sets\nhomeomorphic to Rn and hence contractible. Thus all closed manifolds have finite\ncategory. A sphere S n has Cat(S n ) = 1 as a sphere can always be covered by two\ncontractible open sets (an upper and lower hemisphere) but is itself not contractible.\nIf CP n is n-dimensional complex projective space then CP n can be covered by\nn + 1 charts which are contractible pieces so Cat(CP n ) \u2264 n. However cup product\narguments can be used to show that Cat(CP n ) > n \u2212 1 and so Cat(CP n ) = n for\nall integers n \u2265 0.\nA bouquet of positive dimensional spheres X has Cat(X) = 0 if it is an empty\nbouquet (just a point) or Cat(X) = 1 otherwise. To see this let U0 be an open\nthickening of the attaching point of the bouquet and U1 be X minus the attaching\npoint. U0 is contractible and though U1 is not in general contractible, it is always\ncontractible in X i.e., the inclusion map U1 \u2192 X is homotopically trivial. This\nis because each component of U1 is contractible and X is path connected as the\nbouquet does not involve 0-spheres.\nA bouquet with 0-spheres involved can have category larger than 1 as the bouquet\nwill not be path connected. Each 0 sphere gives an extra point component which\nincreases the category by 1. To address the issue of 0-spheres in quota complexes\nwe define the concept of a \"shell vertex\" in a quota complex.\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 25\n\nDefinition A.2 (Shell vertices). Let X be a finite scalar quota complex with vertex\nof minimal weight vmin . A vertex s of X is called a shell vertex if q \u2212 w(vmin ) \u2264\nw(s) < q.\nNote by Theorem 2.3, X is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres where\nthere is one 0-sphere for each shell vertex not equal to vmin . Thus Cat(X) =\n(Number of shell vertices not equal to vmin )+\u000f where \u000f = 1 if there are any positive\ndimensional spheres in the bouquet and \u000f = 0 if not.\nFor a vector valued quota complex, for the ith coordinate of the weights and quota\nwe can find a vertex vmin,i of minimal weight for that coordinate. Then a vertex s\nis called a shell vertex if qi \u2212 wi (vmin,i ) < wi (s) < qi for some coordinate i.\nTheorem A.3 (Category of vector weighted quota systems). Let X be a finite\nvector weighted quota system with weight dimension N , weight function \u0175 and\nN\nquota q\u0302. So \u0175 : V \u2192 RN\n+ and quota q\u0302 \u2208 R+ .\nX is then the union of N scalar quota complexes.\nFurthermore if X has no shell vertices, we have Cat(X) \u2264 2N \u2212 1. Thus\nCat(X)+1\nprovides a homotopy invariant lower bound for the weight dimension of a\n2\nquota complex with no shell vertices.\nProof. Let Xi be the complex determined by the ith component of the weight-quota\nsystem for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N . Then by definition X = \u222aN\ni=1 Xi . By Theorem 2.3, each Xi\nis homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres. If X has no shell vertices then no\n0-spheres occur in these bouquets and hence each Xi can be covered by two open\nsets which are contractible in Xi and hence in X. Thickening up these open sets so\nthat they are open in X, we see that X can then be covered by 2N open sets, each\ncontractible in X. Thus Cat(X) \u2264 2N \u2212 1 by definition. The rest of the theorem\nthen follows readily.\n\u0003\n\nAppendix B. Every finite simplicial complex is a quota complex.\nIn this appendix we provide a proof that every finite simplicial complex is a\nquota complex. This fact already appeared in unpublished work of Manuel Alves\nwho was working on independent undergraduate research on voting theory under\nthe guidance of the first author. Given a monotone voting system on a set V\nof voters, the voting complex associated to the system is an abstract simplicial\ncomplex based on V whose faces consist of the losing coalitions of the system.\nThe proof of the following theorem then parallels the fact that every monotone\nvoting system is a (vector valued) quota system. Let |F | denote the number of\nvertices in a face F .\nTheorem B.1. If X is a finite simplicial complex on vertex set V then X is a\nquota complex i.e., there exists a weight function \u0175 : V \u2192 Rn+ for some n and\nquota q\u0302 \u2208 Rn+ such that X is the simplicial complex associated to quota system\n[\u0175 : q\u0302].\nFurthermore the weights and the quota can be chosen to have positive integer\ncoordinates and these coordinates can be assumed to all be distinct.\n\n\f26\n\nJONATHAN PAKIANATHAN AND TROY WINFREE\n\nProof. Let L denote the set of maximal faces (facets) of X. Order these faces\nL = {F1 , . . . , Fs }. Define a scalar valued quota system wi : V \u2192 R+ by setting\n(\n1 if v \u2208 Fi\nwi (v) =\n|Fi | + 1 if v \u2208\n/ Fi\nSet quota qi = |Fi | + 1. It is simple to check that the subcomplex of the simplex\non V determined by the quota system [wi : qi ] is exactly the simplex Fi and its\nfaces. Letting \u0175 : V \u2192 Rs+ be the function with coordinates the wi and q\u0302 \u2208 Rs+ be\nthe vectorSwith coordinates theSqi , then [\u0175 : q\u0302] is subcomplex of the simplex on V\ns\ns\ngiven by i=1 Fi . Hence X = i=1 Fi is the quota complex [\u0175 : q\u0302].\nDefine as usual the weight of a face to be the sum of the weights of the vertices in\nthe face. Since X has a finite number of faces, only a finite number of vectors occur\nas weights of the faces of X. It is clear then that we may change the coordinates of\nthe quota by subtracting sufficiently small positive numbers from the coordinates so\nthat the quota determines the same complex as the original quota system and has\ndistinct positive rational entries and that these quota coordinates are not acheived\nas the weight of any face in the simplex on V . It is then clear that we can perturb\nthe weights of the vertices by small amounts so that the resulting quota complex\nstill determines the same complex and so that the weights of the vertices consist of\nvectors of distinct positive rational numbers and such that no weight vectors share\nany coordinates which each other or with the quota vector.\nFinally scaling all weight vectors and the quota vector by the least common\nmultiple of the denominators of all rational numbers involved, we get a quota system determining the same complex as the original, where weights and quota have\npositive integer coordinates and all these coordinates are distinct.\n\u0003\n\nAppendix C. Expectation Justification\nWe adopt the setup and notation from the beginning of section 3 in this section\nof the appendix.\nFurthermore set Sihigh (x) = sbi (x)/2f (x/(i+1)) and Silow (x) = sbi (x/(i + 1))/2f (x) .\nWe have that\n\u0001\n\u0001\ns0 (q)\ns0 (dq/(i+1)e)\nSilow (q) \u2248\n\ni+1\n\u0001\ns0 (q)\nj\nj\n\nP\n\n\u2264 Si (q) \u2264 P\n\nj\n\ni+1\n\u0001\ns0 (dq/(i+1)e)\nj\n\n\u2248 Sihigh (q).\n\n\u0001 f (x)\n(x)\nSo if we take Sbi (x) = fi+1\n/2\nthen for x with f (x/(i + 1)) \u2265 i, Silow (x) <\nSbi (x) < Sihigh (x). The global behavior of the family of functions Sbi (x) is easy to\nascertain; we collect some of the features in the following proposition.\nProposition C.1. Let k 0 be the smallest positive integer such that f (\u03ba) \u2264 k 0 , and\nfor j \u2265 k 0 let xj \u2208 [\u03ba, \u221e) such that f (xj ) = j. Then for all i \u2265 k 0 , Sbi (xi ) = 0,\nlimx\u2192\u221e Sbi (x) = 0 and Sbi (x) has exactly one critical value in [xi , \u221e) which is a\nmaximum. Moreover, if mi is the critical point of Sbi (x) in [xi , \u221e), then x2i+1 <\nmi < x2i+2 and limi\u2192\u221e Sbi (mi ) = 0.\n\n\fQUOTA COMPLEXES, PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND THE GOLDBACH CONJECTURE 27\n\nProof. The first assertions are an exercise in undergraduate calculus: we may compute\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ni\nX\n1\nSbi0 (x) = f 0 (x)Sbi (x) \uf8f0\n\u2212 ln 2\uf8fb ,\nf (x) \u2212 j\nj=0\nfrom which it follows that Sbi (x) has exactly one critical value in [xi , \u221e) which is a\nmaximum.\nIn order to establish the bounds on mi we use the following sequence (see [BBG]\npg. 10)\n2i+1\nX\u22121 1\n\u2192 ln 2 as i \u2192 \u221e.\nli =\nj\ni\nj=2\n\nNamely, consider the sequences\nai =\n\ni\nX\n\n1\n\nj=0\n\nf (x2i+1 ) \u2212 j\n\n=\n\n2i+1\nX\n\ni\n2i+2\nX\nX 1\n1\n1\nand bi =\n=\n.\nj\nf (x2i+2 ) \u2212 j\nj\nj=i+1\nj=0\nj=i+2\n\nThen, ai is a bounded decreasing sequence and bi is a bounded increasing sequence,\nso they converge. Furthermore a2i \u22121 = li and b2i \u22122 \u2212 li \u2192 0 as i \u2192 \u221e, so ai , bi \u2192\nln 2 as i \u2192 \u221e. Hence, since ai is decreasing we must have that x2i+1\u0001 < mi , and\n2i+1\nsince bi is increasing we must have that mi < x2i+2 . So Sbi (mi ) < 2i+2\nand\ni+1 /2\n\u0001\n\u221a\n2n\n2n\nb\nsince, by Stirling's formula,\n\u223c 2 / \u03c0n it follows that limi\u2192\u221e Si (mi ) = 0. \u0003\nn\n\nNote that while it is reasonable to make the the approximation\n\u0001\n\u0001\nf (q)\nf (q\u2212v1 )\nsi (q) \u2212 si (q \u2212 v1 )\ni+1\ni+1 \u2212\nP\n,\nHi (q) = P\n\u2248 f (q)\n2\n\u2212 2f (q\u2212v1 )\nj sj (q) \u2212\nj sj (q \u2212 v1 )\nthe function on the right seems to be less amenable to a simple general analysis.\nReferences\n[A]\n\nT.
