The latter scenario provides a strong coupling,\nbut a small electric polarization. The combination of the\ntwo approaches is clearly advantageous, but difficult to\nachieve. The best known example is BiFeO3 ,12 which\nexhibits a plethora of interesting effects related to the\ncoupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism.13,14\nThe recently discovered complex oxide BiMnFe2 O6\nrepresents another system combining the two scenarios\nplausible for multiferroicity: the lone-pair Bi3+ cation\nand the spiral magnetic ground state. Neither of the\ntwo, however, lead to ferroelectricity. The polar displacements of Bi3+ are ordered in an antiferroelectric\nmanner,15 whereas the spiral magnetic structure is nonpolar due to a strong antiferromagnetic coupling along\nthe crystallographic c direction.\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online) The crystal structure of BiMnFe2 O6 .\nThe Fe and Mn cations are situated in the oxygen octahedra\n(in the color version, blue and violet polyhedra denote the\nFeMn1 and FeMn2 positions, respectively).\n\nThe unique crystal structure of BiMnFe2 O6 features\nfragments of the hypothetical hcp oxygen-based MO\nbuilding blocks that are related by a mirror operation into a polysynthetically twinned structure.15 The\nFe3+ (d5 ) and Mn3+ (d4 ) cations are nearly randomly\ndistributed over two crystallographically distinct positions, both octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms\n(Fig. 1). The octahedra are interconnected into a framework through corner-, edge-, and face-sharing, providing complex paths for the magnetic exchange. In spite\nof the random distribution of the Fe and Mn cations, a\nlong-range magnetic order was reported in BiMnFe2 O6\nbelow TN ' 220 K, according to 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. The low-temperature neutron powder diffrac-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2.\n(Color online) Neutron diffraction patterns for\nBiMnFe2 O6 at different temperatures. The arrows show the\nmagnetic reflections.\n\ntion revealed the incommensurate propagation vector of\nthe magnetic structure, yet no details of the ground-state\nspin arrangement have been reported.15\nSpiral magnetic structures are capable of inducing\nferroelectricity in a number of transition-metal oxides, such as TbMnO3 ,16 Ni3 V2 O8 ,17,18 MnWO4 ,19 and\nBa0.5 Sr0.5 Zn2 Fe12 O22 .20 In contrast to the aforementioned compounds, BiMnFe2 O6 remains paraelectric below TN .15 To understand the lack of ferroelectricity, we\nstudied the magnetic structure and explored the underlying frustrated spin lattice. Although the strong frustration leads to the formation of magnetic helices propagating along b, the unfrustrated antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ncoupling along c induces the 222 point symmetry of the\nmagnetically ordered state and cancels the possible electric polarization.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe powder sample of BiMnFe2 O6 was synthesized by\nhigh-temperature solid-state reaction in air. Stoichiometric amounts of raw materials (Bi2 O3 , Mn2 O3 , Fe2 O3 )\nwere ground thoroughly and heated up to 800 \u25e6 C in\n5 h. After annealing for 10 h, the powder was reground,\npressed into a pellet, and heated at 1000 \u25e6 C for 100 h\nwith several intermediate grindings.\nNeutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were collected\non a ' 12 g sample of BiMnFe2 O6 , contained in a 9.5 mm\ndiameter vanadium can. A closed cycle He refrigerator\nwas used for temperature control. Patterns were collected with the BT-1 32-detector high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology Center for Neutron Research,\n\nGaithersburg, MD. A Cu(311) monochromator with a\n90\u25e6 takeoff angle and 15 min in-pile collimation was used.\nThe neutron wavelength was 1.5402(1) \u00c5. Data from the\n32 detectors were combined to give pseudo one-detector\ndata over a total scan range of 3\u25e6 \u2264 2\u03b8 \u2264 167.75\u25e6 with\na step size of 0.05\u25e6 (2\u03b8). The magnetic structure was\nanalyzed with the JANA2006 program.21\nDensity functional theory (DFT) band structure calculations were performed in the full-potential local-orbital\n(FPLO) code.22 We used local density approximation\n(LDA)23 supplied with a mean-field (DFT+U ) correction\nfor correlation effects in the Fe/Mn 3d shell. The k-mesh\ncomprised 192 points for the 40-atom unit cell and 64\npoints for the 80-atom supercell. The correlated shell\nwas parameterized with an effective on-site Coulomb repulsion Ud = 5 eV and exchange Jd = 1 eV,24,25 whereas\nthe double-counting was corrected in the fully-localizedlimit (atomic limit) fashion. To evaluate individual exchange couplings, total energies for a number of collinear\nspin configurations were mapped onto a classical Heisenberg model. The validity of the computational results\nwas checked by calculations within generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA)26 and by choosing Ud values of\n4 and 6 eV. Similar to Cu2+ oxides,27 the exchangecorrelation potential (LDA vs. GGA) has marginal effect\non the spin model, whereas a change in Ud only shifts\nthe exchange couplings in a systematic way and keeps\ntheir ratios nearly constant. The DFT-based spin model\nwas further studied by classical Monte-Carlo simulations\nwith the spinmc algorithm of the ALPS package.28\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMagnetic structure\n\nAt room temperature (RT), BiMnFe2 O6 crystallizes\nin an orthorhombic unit cell with a = 5.03590(3) \u00c5,\nb = 7.07342(4) \u00c5, c = 12.65425(6) \u00c5, and P bcm space\nsymmetry.29 Below TN ' 220 K, extra reflections appear on the NPD patterns (Fig. 2). These reflections are\nof magnetic origin and can not be attributed to a structural phase transition because the x-ray diffraction experiment does not show any change down to T = 120 K.15\nThe magnetic reflections on the T = 7 K pattern are\nindexed with a propagation vector k = [0, \u03b2, 0] with\n\u03b2 = 0.1379(1). The propagation vector is inside of the\nBrillouin zone and has a star with two arms k, \u2212k. The\nlittle group of the propagation vector Gk is P b21 m. In\nBiMnFe2 O6 , there are two symmetrically independent\nmagnetic species in the nuclear P bcm structure: FeMn1\n(8e: 0.4891, \u22120.1597, \u22120.6036) and FeMn2 (4a: 0, 0, 12 )\n(Fig. 1). In the little group P b21 m, this corresponds\nto two four-fold magnetic sites for the FeMn1 position\nand one four-fold magnetic site for the FeMn2 position\n(origin at 0, 0, 14 ).

Alternatively, we can describe the symmetry\nof the incommensurately modulated magnetic structure\nby embedding it into a higher-dimensional space and\napplying magnetic superspace groups defined in (3+1)dimensional superspace.30\u201333 The magnetic moment on\natom i is expressed as a vector function:\nMi (x4 ) = Mi0 +\n\nN\nX\n\n[Mins sin(2\u03c0nx4 )+Minc cos(2\u03c0nx4 )],\n\nn=1\n\nwhere n denotes terms of the Fourier series,\nx4 = k(T + ri ) is an internal coordinate, T is the\nlattice translation of the nuclear structure, and ri\nis the position of the atom i in the unit cell of the\nnuclear structure. Monitoring of the intensity of the\nmagnetic and nuclear reflections upon varying temperature revealed that there is no magnetic impact into\nthe intensity of the nuclear reflections, and therefore\nMi0 = 0 for all magnetic sites. Since only the first-order\nsatellites were observed, the Fourier series are reduced\nto the n = 1 terms. A magnetic (Shubnikov) superspace\ngroup describing the transformations of the magnetic\nmodulation waves can be set in correspondence with\n\neach irrep. The magnetic superspace groups are based\non generators of the little group Gk , but the symmetry\nelements transforming the propagation vector k to \u2212k\nalso should be taken into account. This yields four\npossible magnetic superspace groups listed in Table I.\nThe explanation of the magnetic superspace group\nsymbols is provided in Ref. 33\nAll four magnetic superspace groups were tested\nin the refinement. Acceptable solutions were found\nin magnetic superspace groups P bcm10 (0\u03b20)s00s and\nP bcm10 (0\u03b20)00ss, both with the same reliability factor\nfor magnetic reflections RImag = 0.057. In spite of the\nrelatively low reliability factor, the correspondence between the experimental and calculated NPD profile was\nfar from ideal for both models. This indicates that the\nactual solution requires a combination of the irreps \u03933\nand \u03934 , and can be realized in a common subgroup of\nP bcm10 (0\u03b20)s00s and P bcm10 (0\u03b20)00ss. This subgroup\ndepends on a relative shift \u03b4 along the internal space of\nthe conventional origins of two superspace groups. The\nlist of operators of P bcm10 (0\u03b20)s00s and their intersections with the operators of P bcm10 (0\u03b20)00ss for \u03b4 = 0, 41\nare provided in Table II. The resulting common subgroups are P 121 /c110 (0\u03b20)s0s and P 221 21 10 (0\u03b20)0s0s.\nFor any \u03b4 values inequivalent to the cases mentioned\n\n\f4\nabove the common subgroup is P 121 110 (0\u03b20)ss.\nThe solutions in the P 121 /c110 (0\u03b20)s0s and\nP 221 21 10 (0\u03b20)0s0s groups provide the same quality\nof the Rietveld fit and can not be distinguished on this\nbasis. The P 121 /c110 (0\u03b20)s0s magnetic superspace\nsymmetry results in a collinear magnetic structure with\nan antiferromagnetic transverse amplitude modulated\nwave with the magnetic moments confined to the\nac plane. The amplitude of the magnetic moment\nmodulation varies from almost zero to 5.6 \u03bcB , which\nis unrealistically high for the Mn3+ and Fe3+ cations.\nThus, the P 121 /c110 (0\u03b20)s0s solution was ruled out. In\nthe P 221 21 10 (0\u03b20)0s0s model, there are three magnetic\nsymmetrically unequivalent atoms: FeMn1a, FeMn1b,\nand FeMn2 (see Table III), all at the general four-fold\nsites of the P 221 21 space group.\nThe (10 | 0 0 0 12 )\noperator of the magnetic superspace group requires\n\nMs,z (FeMn1a) =\nMs,x (FeMn1a) =\nMs,z (FeMn2) =\nMc,z (FeMn2) =\n\nMc,x (FeMn1a) =\n\u2212Mc,z (FeMn1a) =\nMc,x (FeMn2)\nMs,x (FeMn2)\n\nthe Mi0 term to be zero and constrains the magnetic\nmoment modulation functions to odd harmonics only,\nthereby resulting in the absence of the magnetic impact\ninto intensity of the nuclear reflections and the absence\nof even-order magnetic satellites.33 The components\nof the magnetic moment modulation function for the\ngeneral four-fold site are related by symmetry elements\nof the P 221 21 10 (0\u03b20)0s0s magnetic superspace group,\nas shown in Table IV.\nSince in the nuclear structure the atoms FeMn1a and\nFeMn1b are crystallographically equivalent, it is reasonable to assume that the modulation of the magnetic moment at these positions follows the same type of modulation waves. The solution was found with the following restrictions (not imposed by the magnetic superspace\ngroup) on the coefficients of the magnetic moment modulation functions:\n\nMs,z (FeMn1b) =\n\u2212Ms,x (FeMn1b) =\n\nMc,x (FeMn1b) =\nMc,z (FeMn1b) =\n=\n=\n\nM1\nM2\nM3\n0\n\nThe refined magnetic moment components along the b\naxis were smaller than their standard deviations and were\nfixed to zero. The refined magnetic parameters at different temperatures are provided in Table V. The experimental, calculated, and difference NPD profiles at\nT = 7 K are shown in Fig. 3. The temperature dependencies of the ordered magnetic moment for the FeMn1\nand FeMn2 positions are given in Fig. 4. Extrapolations\nof these dependencies with the M = M0 [(1 \u2212 T /TN )\u03b1 ]\u03b2\nfunction give coinciding TN values of 221(2) K and\n219(4) K for the FeMn1 and FeMn2 positions, respectively, and the magnetic moments of M0 (FeMn1) =\n3.76(4) \u03bcB and M0 (FeMn2) = 4.0(1) \u03bcB .\nThe spin arrangement in the BiMnFe2 O6 magnetic\nstructure is shown in Fig. 5. BiMnFe2 O6 adopts a spiral magnetic structure consisting of antiferromagnetic\nhelixes propagating along the b-axis with a period of\n' 3.5b. The helixes are associated with the FeMn1\nand FeMn2 atomic chains running along the b-axis,\nwhere the magnetic atoms are separated by b/2.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art computational tools, such as virtual crystal approximation (VCA) or coherent potential\napproximation (CPA), cannot be applied to this case,\nsince they provide an averaged description of a disordered system, while we are targeting magnetic properties that depend on local interactions. The insulating\nnature of BiMnFe2 O6 15 suggests localized 3d electrons\nof transition metals; therefore, the distinct spin- 52 Fe3+\n(d5 ) and spin-2 Mn3+ (d4 ) sites are randomly distributed\non the spin lattice. Further, orbital ordering for Mn3+\nresults in dramatic differences among the Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe, Mn\u2013\nO\u2013Mn, and Fe\u2013O\u2013Mn superexchanges (see below).

(Color online) LDA density of states for BiFe3 O6 .\nThe Fermi level is at zero energy. The gapless energy spectrum is caused by underestimation of the electronic correlations in LDA.\n\nof these features. To capture effects arising from the\nlocalized moments of Fe3+ and Mn3+ , we calculated exchange integrals for several systems with ordered Fe and\nMn atoms, and accessed all possible scenarios of the\nsuperexchange. In these calculations, we kept the experimental atomic positions, but imposed different arrangements of Fe and Mn, spanning purely Fe (BiFe3 O6 )\nand purely Mn (BiMn3 O6 ) cases as well as intermediate\n(BiMnFe2 O6 and BiMn2 FeO6 ) configurations.\nThe LDA band structure depends only marginally on\nthe Fe/Mn ordering. The density of states (DOS) features Bi 6s bands below \u221210 eV, O 2p states between\n\u22127 eV and \u22122 eV, transition-metal 3d states at the Fermi\nlevel, and Bi 6p states above 3 eV (Fig. 6). The effect of\nsubstituting Mn for Fe is a change in the electron count\nand the ensuing shift of the Fermi level within the 3d\nbands. Irrespective of the Fe/Mn ratio, LDA band structures are metallic due to the heavy underestimation of\nstrong electronic correlations. The insulating spectrum\nis correctly reproduced by DFT+U (see upper panel of\nFig. 7). In particular, the band gaps of about 1.5 eV\nfor BiFe3 O6 and 1.1 eV for BiMn3 O6 at Ud = 5 eV are\nconsistent with the black color of the compound.\nSuperexchange couplings in insulating compounds intimately depend on the orbital state of the transition\nmetal. Five unpaired electrons of Fe3+ fill five d orbitals\nand leave no orbital degrees of freedom. By contrast,\nMn3+ has four unpaired electrons only, and hence one\nof the d orbitals is unoccupied in the Mott-insulating\nstate. Since there is a sizable crystal-field splitting (about\n1.5 eV) driven by the octahedral coordination of the\nFeMn1 and FeMn2 sites, the three t2g states are halfoccupied, while the two eg states have to share the remaining electron. The half-filled orbital is picked out by\na weak distortion of the octahedral local environment. In\nthe following, we analyze such distortions in more detail\nto determine which of the two eg orbitals is half-filled in\n\nOrbital-resolved DOS (eV-1)\n\n1\n\n0\nt2g\nd3z2-r2\n\n-1\n\ndx2-y2\n\nMn2\n\n1\n\n0\nt2g\nd3z2-r2\n\n-1\n-12\n\n-8\n\ndx2-y2\n\n-4\n0\nEnergy (eV)\n\n4\n\n8\n\nFIG. 7.

Four out of five d orbitals show filled\nspin-up and empty spin-down states, whereas the states of\nthe remaining d orbital (dx2 \u2212y2 for Mn1 and d3z2 \u2212r2 for Mn2)\nare mostly above the Fermi level for both spin directions. The\nFermi level is at zero energy.\n\nthe insulating state.\nThe FeMn1 position reveals one long bond of about\n2.5 \u00c5 (FeMn1\u2013O2, Table VI) that we choose as the local z axis. According to simple electrostatic arguments\nof crystal-field theory, the long bond along z shifts the\nd3z2 \u2212r2 orbital down in energy with respect to the dx2 \u2212y2\norbital. The opposite scenario is found for FeMn2, where\nthe local environment is a squeezed octahedron. The\nshort FeMn2\u2013O1 bond (about 1.96 \u00c5, Table VI), which\nwe take as the local z-axis, shifts the d3z2 \u2212r2 orbital up in\nenergy. Therefore, the unpaired electron of Mn3+ should\noccupy the d3z2 \u2212r2 orbital for FeMn1 and the dx2 \u2212y2 orbital for FeMn2. This conclusion is verified by DFT+U\ncalculations that place unpaired electrons on the respective orbitals, while shifting both spin-up and spin-down\nstates for the remaining eg orbital (dx2 \u2212y2 and d3z2 \u2212r2 for\nFeMn1 and FeMn2, respectively) above the Fermi level\n(see Fig. 7).37\nThe orbital order in BiMn3 O6 is formally of the ferrotype within the FeMn1 and FeMn2 sublattices, yet of\nthe antiferro-type between the two sublattices. However,\nthis notation is deceptive because of the different local\naxes on neighboring atoms. The magnetic model largely\n\n\f8\ndeviates from the conventional scenario38 of AFM superexchange for ferro-type orbital order and ferromagnetic (FM) superexchange for antiferro-type orbital order. In the following, we show that the peculiar arrangement of empty eg orbitals in BiMn3 O6 induces sizable\nFM superexchange for nearly all couplings and alters the\nspiral ground state that arises from the purely AFM spin\nlattice of BiFe3 O6 .\n\nC.\n\na\n\nb\n\nMicroscopic magnetic model\n\nExchange couplings calculated for different superexchange scenarios (Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe, Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn, Fe\u2013O\u2013Mn, and\nMn\u2013O\u2013Fe) are listed in Table VII. The Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe, Mn\u2013\nO\u2013Mn, and Fe\u2013O\u2013Mn superexchanges show sharp differences for most of the couplings, while the Fe\u2013O\u2013Mn\nand Mn\u2013O\u2013Fe cases are only different for interactions\nbetween the FeMn1 and FeMn2 sublattices (i.e., when\nthe two metal sites are not related by symmetry). In\nTable VII, we restrict ourselves to short-range couplings\nmatching direct connections between the FeMn octahedra. Long-range interactions are expected to be weak, as\nconfirmed by the following qualitative argument. Longrange superexchange requires suitable overlap of atomic\norbitals along a M\u2013O\u2013O\u2013M (or even more complex) pathway, and can be achieved for one orbital channel only. By\ncontrast, short-range superexchange is possible for most\nof the orbital channels, and should therefore dominate\nin systems with several magnetic orbitals. To verify this\nconclusion for BiMnFe2 O6 , we calculated the exchange\ncouplings within the crystallographic unit cell and within\na supercell doubled along a. The resulting values of Ji\nagreed within 10 % and indicated weak long-range couplings in BiMnFe2 O6 . Below, we demonstrate that our\nminimum microscopic model, restricted to short-range\ncouplings, is sufficient to explain the spiral magnetic\nstructure of BiMnFe2 O6 and the lack of ferroelectricity\nin this compound.\nThe spin lattice of BiMnFe2 O6 incorporates nine inequivalent exchanges (Fig. 8 and Table VII). Eight of\nthese couplings are found in the ab plane, whereas J8\nconnects the layers along c. The interlayer coupling is\nweakly influenced by the Fe/Mn substitution, and remains one of the leading AFM interactions for all superexchange scenarios (Table VII). The robustness of J8\nshould be traced back to the orbital order for Mn3+ . The\nlocal z-axis of the FeMn1 octahedra roughly matches the\ncrystallographic c direction. Therefore, the replacement\nof Fe by Mn results in an empty dx2 \u2212y2 orbital (Fig. 7)\nthat contributes weakly to the superexchange along c.\nBy contrast, most of the intralayer couplings are heavily\naffected by changing Mn for Fe.\nIn BiFe3 O6 , eight intralayer couplings are AFM. Excluding the apparently weak J1 , we arrive at seven AFM\ncouplings ranging from 19 K to 74 K (Table VII). Triangular loops abound (Fig. 8) and lead to the strong\nfrustration of the spin lattice. This frustration is largely\n\nJ2\nJ3\nJ7\nJ9\n\nJ1\nJ4\nJ5\nJ6\n\nFeMn1\nFeMn2\n\nFIG. 8.

The Fe\u2013O\u2013Mn and Mn\u2013O\u2013Fe\ncases are intermediate, with partially reduced AFM couplings. Large FM contributions to the superexchange can\nbe traced back to empty d orbitals of Mn3+ . These orbitals provide the strong \u03c3-overlap with oxygen orbitals\nand a leading contribution to the superexchange.\nTo evaluate the ground state of the proposed model,\nwe performed classical Monte-Carlo simulations for a\n16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The unit cell of the spin lattice incorporated six\nmagnetic atoms within one layer (half of the crystallographic unit cell). The temperature was set to 10 K, well\nbelow the ordering temperature TN (see further in this\nsection). Spin-spin correlation functions for purely Fe3+\n(S = 25 ) and purely Mn3+ (S = 2) lattices are given in\nTable VIII. The correlation functions normalized for S 2\nare \u22121 for antiparallel spins and +1 for parallel spins. Intermediate values indicate non-collinear configurations.\nWe consider the Fe3+ case first. The normalized spinspin correlation for J8 is close to \u22121; therefore, the interlayer ordering is collinear and AFM. Similar correlations\non the J5 and J6 bonds indicate the same propagation\nvector along b for the FeMn1 and FeMn2 sublattices. Further on, similar correlations on the J2 and J3 as well as\non J7 and J9 bonds signify the same magnetic order along\nthe respective bonds and, consequently, a twice shorter\nperiodicity along b for the magnetic unit cell compared\nto the crystallographic unit cell. To find out the ordering\npattern along a, we note that the respective FeMn2 atoms\nare connected via J2 and J3 or J7 and J9 bonds. The correlations along these paths are different; therefore, the\nspins on the FeMn2 atoms should be parallel (i.e., the\nmagnetic moment rotates for a certain angle \u03c61 on the\n\n\f9\n\nTABLE VII.

The principal spin arrangement is described by three parameters,\nwhich are the angles between the spins on the J5 (J6 ), J2 ,\nand J7 bonds. According to our simulations, these angles\nare \u03c6 = 226 deg, \u03c61 = 76 deg, and \u03c62 = 146 deg, respectively, in remarkable agreement with the experimental\nvalues of \u03c6 = 206 deg, \u03c61 = 39 deg, and \u03c62 = 167 deg.\nOur microscopic model for BiFe3 O6 reproduces the experimental magnetic structure of BiMnFe2 O6 quite well.\nThe remaining discrepancies are likely related to the partial replacement of Fe by Mn.\nThe complete substitution of Mn for Fe changes the\nmagnetic ground state. According to Table VIII, most\nof the normalized spin-spin correlations in BiMn3 O6 are\nclose to +1. The only negative correlation refers to the\nJ8 bond and indicates AFM interlayer coupling. The\nintralayer ordering is now collinear FM due to predominantly FM exchange couplings (J1 , J2 , J3 , J6 , J7 , and\nJ9 , see Table VII).

While BiFe3 O6\nand BiMn3 O6 present two opposite scenarios of strong\nand weak frustration, respectively, BiMnFe2 O6 lies between these distinct regimes. The spiral ground state\nof this compound is driven by the frustration of intralayer exchange couplings that remain predominantly\nAFM for mixed Fe\u2013O\u2013Mn superexchange pathways (see\nTable VII).\nFor an additional test of our microscopic model, we\ncalculated magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) and estimated the\nN\u00e9el temperature TN as the position of the kink in the\ntemperature dependence of \u03c7. Transition temperatures\nfor BiFe3 O6 (420 K) and BiMn3 O6 (150 K) reasonably\nagree with the experimental TN of 220 K that lies between the two calculated values.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nOur experimental and computational study provides\nmicroscopic insight into the physics of BiMnFe2 O6 . This\ncompound features a strongly frustrated spin lattice with\npredominantly AFM exchange couplings that induce the\nspiral magnetic order. The comparison between BiFe3 O6\nand BiMn3 O6 suggests that AFM exchange couplings are\nan essential prerequisite for the spiral magnetic order.\nThe crystal structure itself may still allow for different\nground states; therefore, it is the transition-metal cation\nthat determines the type of the long-range magnetic order. In this respect, first reports on cation substitution15\nlook promising, because the change in the Fe/Mn ratio\nor an incorporation of other magnetic cations could alter\nthe magnetic structure and other physical properties.\nBiMnFe2 O6 is a magnetic compound that conforms\nto two mechanisms of ferroelectricity. First, lone pairs\nof Bi3+ induce polar displacements. Second, the noncollinear magnetic structure breaks the inversion symmetry and allows for magnetic-field-induced electric polar-\n\n\f10\nization. However, none of the two mechanisms succeed in\nrendering the compound ferroelectric. Bi3+ -related polar displacements form an antiferroelectric pattern that\nleads to zero net polarization. The electronic mechanism\nmeets a similar obstacle of the AFM interlayer coupling\nand the ensuing non-polar (albeit non-centrosymmetric)\nmagnetic structure. The lack of polarity in both atomic\nand magnetic structures naturally explains the absence\nof the ferroelectric response in BiMnFe2 O6 below TN .15\nOur results demonstrate that the simple criteria of ferroelectricity and multiferroicity are not universal, since\nthe polarization induced by any kind of polar distortion (atomic displacement or spin spiral) can be wiped\nout by an overall antiferroelectric/antiferromagnetic order. The combination of lone-pair and transition-metal\ncations does not necessarily lead to a magnetic ferroelectric, whereas an arbitrary incommensurate magnetic\nstructure may not allow for the electronic mechanism\nof ferroelectricity. These simple observations make the\nsearch for multiferroics a challenge, and put forward the\ncharge-ordering mechanism as a more robust approach to\nthe design of magnetoelectric materials.\nThe cancellation of polarity in an incommensurate\nmagnetic structure has been proposed for the spin-chain\ncuprate NaCu2 O2 39 and for a number of layered compounds, such as \u03b1-CaCr2 O4 40,41 and \u03b1-SrCr2 O4 ,42 that\nwere considered as potential multiferroics. The nonfrustrated AFM interlayer coupling seems to be a general obstacle for ferroelectricity in layered systems, like\n\u03b1-CaCr2 O4 ,43 or in three-dimensional systems with twodimensional frustrated units, as in BiMnFe2 O6 . To overcome this problem, one has to design materials with\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\nArtem.Abakumov@ua.ac.be\naltsirlin@gmail.com\nK. F. Wang, J.-M.

In the case of\nBiMnFe2 O6 , cation substitutions preserve the long-range\norder15 and can be promising for tuning this compound\ntoward ferroelectric and possibly multiferroic behavior.\nIn summary, we have solved the spiral magnetic structure of BiMnFe2 O6 and proposed a microscopic magnetic\nmodel for this compound. The ground state features\nspins lying in the ac plane and propagating along b by a\n' 204.8 deg rotation about the b axis. The two inequivalent FeMn positions reveal the same propagation vector.\nThe spiral magnetic structure is driven by the strong\nfrustration of antiferromagnetic exchange couplings on\na complex spin lattice in the ab plane. However, the\ncoupling along the c direction is non-frustrated, leading\nto antiparallel spin arrangement in neighboring layers.\nThe resulting magnetic structure is non-polar and, alike\nthe centrosymmetric (antiferroelectric) atomic structure,\nprecludes the ferroelectric behavior of BiMnFe2 O6 .\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Oleg Janson for granting access to\nthe flyswatter program and fruitful discussions.
