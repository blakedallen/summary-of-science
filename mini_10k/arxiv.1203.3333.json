We introduce a division formula on a possibly singular projective subvariety X of complex projective space PN , which, e.g., provides explicit representations of solutions to various polynomial division\nproblems on the affine part of X. Especially we consider a global effective version of the Brian\u00e7on-Skoda-Huneke theorem.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we construct a division-interpolation integral formula for\npolynomial ideals on an algebraic, not necessarily smooth, subvariety V of\nCN of pure dimension n. Such division formulas, for smooth V , have been\nused by several authors, see, e.g., [11], [10] and [9]. In [4] were introduced\ndivision formulas on Cn where the integration \"takes place\" over the entire\ncompactification Pn . This made it possible to make a more careful analysis\nat infinity which led to explicit representation of membership with sharper\ndegree estimates than by earlier known formulas.\nOur new formula involves integration over the closure X of V in PN .\nIt is quite general and might be used to represent solutions to a variety of\nmembership problems, but our focus is on a global effective Brian\u00e7on-SkodaHuneke type polynomial division result on V , [8, Theorem A], generalizing\ntheorems of Ein-Lazarsfeld, [13], and Hickel, [17], to non-smooth V . Our\nformula does not in any substantial way contribute to the proof of this result\nso the novelty is that the membership is realized by an explicit formula. One\ncould hope that this formula keeps arithmetic information1, for instance,\nthat the coefficients are rational if the data have rational coefficients, but\nwe have not been able to prove this except for very special examples. One\ncould also hope for estimates of the size of the coefficients. In any case\nwe think that the very explicitness is of interest in itself. If applied to\nNullstellensatz data we get a representation of a solution with a polynomial\ndegree that is not too far from the optimal one, cf., Remark 1.4 below.\nLet X be the closure of V in PN , let JX denote the associated homogeneous ideal in the graded ring S = C[z0 , . . . , zN ], and let S(l) denote the\nmodule S but where all degrees are shifted by l. Let\n(1.1)\n\na\n\na\n\nM\n0 \u2192 SM \u2192\n* * * \u21921 S0\n\nbe a minimal graded free resolution of S/JX ; here Sk = S(\u2212d1k ) \u2295 * * * \u2295\nS(\u2212drkk ) and the mappings ak = (aij\nk ) are matrices of homogeneous forms in\nDate: September 24, 2018.\nThe first author was partially supported by the Swedish Research Council. The second\nauthor was supported by a postdoc grant from the Swedish Research Council.\n1as does the ingenious formula in [10] in case with Nullstellensatz data and X = Pn .\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMATS ANDERSSON & LISA NILSSON\n\nCN +1 with\nj\ni\ndeg aij\nk = dk \u2212 dk\u22121 .\n\nSince JX has pure dimension it follows from [14, Corollary 20.14] that M \u2264\nN , see also [8, Section 2.7]. Recall that the regularity of X is by definition\nthe regularity of the ideal JX , so that\nreg X := max(dik \u2212 k) + 1,\n\n(1.2)\n\nk,i\n\nsee, e.g., [15, Ch. 4].\nGiven polynomials F1 , . . . , Fm on V of degrees at most d, let fj be the\ncorresponding d-homogeneous forms on CN +1 . That is, if z = (z0 , . . . , zN )\nand z \u2032 = (z1 , . . . , zN ), then fj (z) = z0d F (z \u2032 /z0 ). As usual we can consider fj\nas sections of the restriction to X of the line bundle O(d) over PN . Let Zf\nbe the common zero set of the fj on X.\nWe now describe our main result in this paper. Assume that \u03c1 is an integer\nthat is larger than or equal to d min(m, n + 1) + reg X \u2212 1, and let \u03c6 be a\nsection of O(\u03c1) over X. Let us assume in addition that X is irreducible, cf.,\nRemark 1.3 below. We then have an explicit division-interpolation formula\nZ\nZ\nm\nX\nB \u03c1 (\u03b6, z)\u2227Rf (\u03b6)\u2227\u03c9(\u03b6)\u03c6(\u03b6),\nA\u03c1j (\u03b6, z)\u03c6(\u03b6) +\nfj (z)\n(1.3) \u03c6(z) =\nj=1\n\nX\n\nX\n\nwhere, for fixed z, the integrals in the sum exist as principal values at\nXsing \u222a Zf , B \u03c1 (*, z) is a smooth form, and Rf \u2227\u03c9 is a residue current on X\nwith support on Zf , so that the second \"integral\" is the action of Rf \u2227\u03c9 on\n\u00b1B \u03c1 \u03c6. Moreover, both A\u03c1j and B \u03c1 are holomorphic (homogeneous polynomials of degrees \u03c1 \u2212 d and \u03c1, respectively) in z. For the precise formula, see\nTheorem 4.3 below.\nAssume that \u03a6 is a polynomial of degree at most \u03c1 and let \u03c6 be its \u03c1homogenization. If the current Rf \u2227\u03c9\u03c6 vanishes, i.e., \u03c6 annihilates Rf \u2227\u03c9,\nit follows that\nZ\nA\u03c1j (\u03b6; 1, z \u2032 )\u03c6(\u03b6)\n(1.4)\nQj (z \u2032 ) =\nX\n\nare polynomials such that deg Fj Qj \u2264 \u03c1 and F1 Q1 + * * * + Fm Qm = \u03a6 on V .\nLet us now present our main application of this formula. Let Jf be the\ncoherent analytic ideal sheaf over X generated by fj . Furthermore, let c\u221e\nbe the maximal codimension of the so-called distinguished varieties of the\nsheaf Jf , in the sense of Fulton-MacPherson, that are contained in\nX\u221e := X \\ V,\nsee, e.g., [8, Section 5]. If there are no distinguished varieties contained in\nX\u221e , then we interpret c\u221e as \u2212\u221e. We always have that\nc\u221e \u2264 \u03bc := min(m, n).\nLet |F |2 = |F1 |2 + * * * + |FM |2 .\nTheorem 1.1. Assume that V is a reduced n-dimensional algebraic subvariety of CN , let X be its closure in PN , and assume that X is irreducible.\n\n\f3\n\n(i) There exists a number \u03bc0 with the following property: If F1 , . . . , Fm are\npolynomials of degree \u2264 d, \u03a6 is a polynomial such that\n|\u03a6|/|F |\u03bc+\u03bc0 is locally bounded on V,\n\n(1.5)\nand\n(1.6)\n\n\u0001\n\u03c1 = max deg \u03a6 + (\u03bc + \u03bc0 )dc\u221e deg X, d min(m, n + 1) + reg X \u2212 1 ,\n\nthen Eq. (1.4) defines explicit polynomials Qj such that\n(1.7)\n\n\u03a6 = F1 Q1 + * * * + Fm Qm\n\non V and\n(1.8)\n\ndeg (Fj Qj ) \u2264 \u03c1\n\n(ii) If in addition V is smooth there is a number \u03bc\u2032 with the following property: If F1 , . . . , Fm are polynomials of degree \u2264 d, \u03a6 is a polynomial such\nthat\n(1.9)\n\n|\u03a6|/|F |\u03bc is locally bounded on V,\n\nand\n(1.10)\n\n\u03c1\u2032 = max deg \u03a6 + \u03bcdc\u221e deg X + \u03bc\u2032 , d min(m, n + 1) + reg X \u2212 1),\n\nthen Eq. (1.4) defines explicit polynomials Qj such that (1.7) holds on V\nand\n(1.11)\n\ndeg (Fj Qj ) \u2264 \u03c1\u2032\n\nIf X is smooth one can take \u03bc\u2032 = 0.\nRemark 1.2. In [8, Theorem A] the degree estimates are slightly sharper;\ninstead of d min(m, n + 1) + reg X \u2212 1 in (1.8) and (1.11) one has the number\n(d \u2212 1) min(m, n + 1) + reg X.\nRemark 1.3. Notice that if V is irreducible in CN , then X is irreducible. In\n[8, Theorem A] there is no assumption about irreducibility of X. Formula\n(1.3), as well as Theorem 1.1, hold without this assumption if we replace\nthe bound d min(m, n + 1) + reg X \u2212 1 by d min(m, N + 1) + reg X \u2212 1. The\nconstruction is precisely the same; we only use the irreducibility assumption\nin Lemma 4.2, which gives rise to the slightly sharper bound.\nRemark 1.4. If we apply Theorem 1.1 to Nullstellensatz data, i.e., Fj with\nno common\nzero on V and \u03a6 = 1, then we get polynomials Qj by (1.4) such\nP\nthat\nFj Qj = 1 on V and\n\u0001\ndeg (Fj Qj ) \u2264 max (\u03bc + \u03bc0 )dc\u221e deg X, d min(m, n + 1) + reg X \u2212 1 .\n\nIt was proved by Jelonek, [19], that one can find a solution such that\ndeg (Fj Qj ) \u2264 cm d\u03bc deg X,\n\nwhere cm = 1 if m \u2264 n and cm = 2 otherwise, and this result is essentially\noptimal. In general it is clearly much sharper than what we get; however, if\nc\u221e < \u03bc and d is large enough, then our estimate may be sharper2.\n2The optimal result for case V = Cn was proved by Koll\u00e1r, [20], for d \u2265 3; see [21] and\n[19] for d = 2.\n\n\f4\n\nMATS ANDERSSON & LISA NILSSON\n\nThe main point in this paper is the construction of the formula (1.3) and it\nis performed step by step in Sections 2, 3, and 4. In Section 6 we consider the\nspecial case when X is a hypersurface in Pn+1 . When reading the general\nconstruction it might be instructive to look into this section to see what\neach step boils down to in the hypersurface case. As soon as formula (1.3) is\nestablished, Theorem 1.1 is a simple consequence of the main step in proof\nof Theorem A in [8]; this is explained in Section 5.\nAcknowledgement We are grateful for the referee's careful reading and\nsuggestions to improve the presentation.\n2. Integral representation on PN\nLet\n\u03c0 : CN +1 \\ {0} \u2192 PN\nbe the natural projection. Let U be an open subset of PN . Recall that\ndifferential forms (currents) with values in O(l) can be identified by lhomogeneous differential forms (currents) \u03be on \u03c0 \u22121 U \u2282 CN +1 \\ {0} such\nthat \u03b4\u03b6 \u03be = \u03b4\u03b6\u0304 \u03be = 0, where \u03b4\u03b6 is interior multiplication by\nN\nX\n\n\u03b6j\n\n0\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\u03b6j\n\nand \u03b4\u03b6\u0304 is its conjugate. We will use the norm |\u03be|O(l) = |\u03be|/|\u03b6|l .\nWe first recall from [4] how one can generate representation formulas\nfor holomorphic sections of a vector bundle F \u2192 PN . The construction\nis an adaptation to PN of the idea introduced in [1]; see also [16]. Let\nN\nFz denote the pull-back of F to PN\n\u03b6 \u00d7 Pz under the natural projection\nN\nN\nPN\n\u03b6 \u00d7 Pz \u2192 Pz and define F\u03b6 analogously. Let \u03b4\u03b7 denote contraction with\nthe Oz (1) \u2297 O\u03b6 (\u22121)-valued holomorphic vector field\n\u03b7 = 2\u03c0i\n\nN\nX\n\nzi\n\n0\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b6i\n\nN\nover PN\n\u03b6 \u00d7 Pz . We thus have the mapping\n\n\u03b4\u03b7 : Cl+1,q (O\u03b6 (k) \u2297 Oz (j)) \u2192 Cl,q (O\u03b6 (k \u2212 1) \u2297 Oz (j + 1)),\nN\nwhere Cl,q (O\u03b6 (k) \u2297 Oz (j)) denotes the sheaf of currents on PN\n\u03b6 \u00d7 Pz of\nbidegree (l, q) in \u03b6 and (0, 0) in z that take values in O\u03b6 (k) \u2297 Oz (j). In this\npaper we only deal with forms and currents with respect to \u03b6 and always\nconsider z as a parameter, i.e., no differentials with respect to z occur.\nN\nGiven a vector bundle L \u2192 PN\n\u03b6 \u00d7 Pz , let\nM\nL\u03bd (L) =\nCj,j+\u03bd (O\u03b6 (j) \u2297 Oz (\u2212j) \u2297 L).\nj\n\n \u0304 where \u2202 \u0304 = \u2202 \u0304\u03b6 , then \u2207\u03b7 : L\u03bd (L) \u2192 L\u03bd+1 (L). Furthermore,\nIf \u2207\u03b7 = \u03b4\u03b7 \u2212 \u2202,\n\u2207\u03b7 is a anti-derivation, and \u22072\u03b7 = 0.\n\n\f5\n\nA weight with respect to F \u2192 PN and a point3 z in PN is a section\ng of L0 (Hom (F\u03b6 , Fz )) such that \u2207\u03b7 g = 0, g is smooth for \u03b6 close to z,\nand g0,0 = IF when \u03b6 = z, where g0,0 denotes the component of g with\nbidegree (0, 0), and IF is the identity endomorphism on F . The following\nbasic formula appeared as Proposition 4.1 in [4].\nProposition 2.1. Let g be a weight with respect to F \u2192 PN and z and\nassume that \u03c8 is a holomorphic section of F \u2297 O(\u2212N ).

Then\n\u03c6 = \u2295k \u03c6k : E \u2192 E is mapping of odd order since it maps E \u00b1 \u2192 E \u2213 .

In\norder to represent the membership by an integral formula we will use a\nweight g that contains \u03c61 (z) as a factor and apply Proposition 2.1. To\nform such a weight we need a generalization to nontrivial vector bundles,\nintroduced in [4] and inspired by [3] and [7], of so-called Hefer forms.\nDefinition 1. We say that H = (Hkl ) is a Hefer morphism for the complex\nE\u2022 in (2.4) if Hkl are smooth sections of\nL\u2212k+l (Hom (E\u03b6,k , Ez,l ))\nthat are holomorphic in z, Hkl = 0 for k < l, the term (Hll )0,0 of bidegree\n(0, 0) is the identity IEl on the diagonal \u2206, and\n(2.9)\n\nl\n\u2207\u03b7 Hkl = Hk\u22121\n\u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6l+1 (z)Hkl+1 ,\n\nwhere \u03c6k stands for \u03c6k (\u03b6).\nRemark 2.3. Notice that H is even. In fact the term Hkl is a form of degree\nk \u2212 l (mod 2) that takes values in Hom (El , Ek ), so that its total degree is\n(k \u2212 l) + (k \u2212 l) = 0 (mod 2).\nWe do not require H to be holomorphic in \u03b6. Assume that H is a Hefer\nmorphism for E\u2022 and let U and\nP R be the associated currents. We can\nthen form the currents HU = j Hj1 Uj (notice the superscript 1 here) and\nP\nHR = j Hj0 Rj .\nProposition 2.4. Assume that H is a Hefer morphism for the complex\nE\u2022 and assume that E0 is a line bundle.

However, for future reference we\nwill discuss a proof, slightly different from the proof given in [4].\nProof.

However,\nboth terms on the right hand side admit analytic continuations to Re \u03bb > \u2212\u01eb,\nand taking \u03bb = 0 we get Proposition 2.4.\n\u0003\nNow assume that g depends holomorphically on z.

This is the reason for the notion division-interpolation formula. For\na more precise interpolation result, see Proposition 3.3 below.\nRemark 2.6.

However, it follows from the proof of\n[6, Proposition 3.3] that \u03c9n carries no additional singularitites; it is just a\nsmooth form times \u03c9n\u22121 .\nFor any smooth form \u03be on PN there is a unique form \u03b8(\u03be) such that\n(3.4)\n\n\u03b8(\u03be)\u2227\u03a9 = \u03beN,\u2217 ,\n\nwhere \u03beN,\u2217 is the component of \u03be of bidegree (N, \u2217).

We can then form a division-interpolation formula like (1.3), if \u03c1 is big\nenough, such that the residue term vanishes as soon as \u03c6 is in Jf . However,\nour objective is to construct an explicit representation of the solutions in\nTheorem 1.1, and to this end we use the Koszul complex generated by the fj .\nIn this way we get a residue current that is explicitly defined and, moreover,\nperfectly adapted to that theorem.\nLet E \u2032 be a trivial rank m bundle with basis elements e1 , . . . , em , let\nE := E \u2032 \u2297 O(\u2212d), and let e\u2217i be the dual basis elements for (E \u2032 )\u2217 so that\nf := f1 e\u22171 + * * * + fm e\u2217m is a section of E \u2217 = O(d) \u2297 (E \u2032 )\u2217 .

Proof of Theorem 1.1\nThe key step in the proof of Theorem A in [8] is the following result,\nwhich follows from the proof of Theorem A in [8, Section 6]:\nProposition 5.1. Let V be a reduced n-dimensional algebraic subvariety of\nCN and let X be its closure in PN . There is a number \u03bc0 , only depending\non V , such that the following holds: If Fj are polynomials of degree at most\nd and \u03a6 is a polynomial such that (1.5) holds, fj are the d-homogenizations\nof Fj , \u03c1 \u2265 deg \u03a6 + (\u03bc + \u03bc0 )dc\u221e deg X, and \u03c6 is the \u03c1-homogenization of \u03a6,\nthen Rf \u2227\u03c9\u03c6 = 0.\nAssume that V is smooth. There is a number \u03bc\u2032 such that if F1 , . . . , Fm\nare polynomials of degree \u2264 d, fj are the d-homogenizations of Fj , \u03a6 is\na polynomial such that (1.9) holds, \u03c1 \u2265 deg \u03a6 + \u03bcdc\u221e deg X + \u03bc\u2032 , and \u03c6 is\nthe \u03c1-homogenization of \u03a6, then Rf \u2227\u03c9\u03c6 = 0. If X is smooth one can take\n\u03bc\u2032 = 0.\nNow Theorem 1.1 follows with the same constants \u03bc0 and \u03bc\u2032 . In fact,\nconsider the formula (4.12) with \u03c1 as in (1.6), which is an allowed choice in\nview of (3.10). Assume that Fj and \u03a6 are such that (1.5) holds and let \u03c6\nbe the \u03c1-homogenization of \u03a6. By Proposition 5.1, Rf \u2227\u03c9\u03c6 = 0, and hence\nZ\n\u03c6 = f (z) * A\u03c1 (\u03b6, z).\nBy dehomogenization we get the desired representation of the membership.\nPart (ii) of Theorem 1.1 follows in the same way by taking \u03c1\u2032 as in (1.10).\nIt is clear from these arguments that one can replace the number reg X \u2212 1\nby \u03ba0 \u2212 N in Theorem 1.1.\n6. The case when X is a (reduced) hypersurface\nIn this section we illustrate the results in the special case when X is a\nreduced hypersurface in Pn+1 . We thus assume that X = {a = 0} where a\nis a section of O(\u03ba0 ) in Pn+1 , i.e., a = a(\u03b60 , . . . , \u03b6n+1 ) is a \u03ba0 -homogeneous\npolynomial in Cn+2 , and da 6= 0 on (the pull-back to Cn+2 of) X. We first\ndiscuss the general representation formula in Proposition 3.3 in this case. It\ncan of course be obtained from this proposition but we find it instructive to\nderive it directly from the general representation formula (Proposition 2.1)\non Pn+1 .\nRecall that kak := |a|/|\u03b6|\u03ba0 is the natural pointwise norm of a considered\n \u0304 2\u03bb /a, a priori defined for\nas a section of O(\u03ba0 ). It is well-known that \u2202kak\nRe \u03bb \u226b 0, admits a current-valued analytic continuation to Re \u03bb > \u2212\u01eb, and\n \u0304\nthat the value at \u03bb = 0 is \u2202(1/a),\ni.e., \u2202 \u0304 applied to the principal value\ncurrent 1/a.\n\n\f17\n\nRemark 6.1. We have the locally free sheaf resolution\na\n\n(6.1)\n\n0 \u2192 O(\u2212\u03ba0 ) \u2192 O(0)\nN\n\nof OP /JX , and it is readily checked that the associated residue current\n \u0304\nRE is the current \u2202(1/a)\ntimes a homomorphism (from O(0) to O(\u2212\u03ba0 ))\nthat has odd order. However we will derive the representation formula on\nX in a more direct way and then we do not have to bother about these sign\nproblems. Notice that the number \u03ba0 here is consistent with the definition\nin the general case. Also notice that reg X = d11 \u2212 1 + 1 = \u03ba0 , cf., (1.2).\nLet ha (w, z) be a (1, 0)-form such that \u03b4w\u2212z ha = a(z) \u2212 a(w) on Cn+2 \u00d7\nCn+2 , and let us write ha (\u03b1\u03b6, z) for \u03c4 \u2217 h, cf, Section 2.2.

If \u03c6 is a holomorphic\nsection of O(l) and g is a weight with respect to O(l \u2212 \u03ba0 + n + 1), then we\nhave from Proposition 2.1, with F = O(n + 1 + l), the representation\nZ\ng \u03bb \u2227g\u03c6.\n\u03c6(z) =\nPn+1\n\nSince\n\u2212\u2207\u03b7 ha (\u03b1\u03b6, z) = a(z) \u2212 a(\u03b1\u03b6) = a(z) \u2212 \u03b1\u03ba0 a(\u03b6),\nwe have that\ng\u03bb = (1 \u2212 kak2\u03bb )\u03b1\u03ba0 +\nNotice that\n\nZ\n\na(z)\n \u0304 2\u03bb /a.\nkak2\u03bb + ha (\u03b1\u03b6, z)\u2227\u2202kak\na(\u03b6)\n\n(1 \u2212 kak2\u03bb )\u03b1\u03ba0 \u2227g\u03c6\n\nvanishes when \u03bb = 0 by the dominated convergence theorem.
