Introduction\nAlthough the standard model (SM) is an extremely successful description of the electroweak\ninteractions, the instability of the weak scale under radiative corrections leads us to believe\nthat there should be physics beyond the SM at an energy scale not far beyond the TeV.\nThe origin of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as well as of fermion masses, might\nbe associated with this new dynamics. A proposal for stabilizing the weak scale using a\ntheory with one compact extra dimension with a non-factorizable, Anti de Sitter metric [1],\nthe Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, can be thought of as dual to a strongly coupled fourdimensional theory with a large number of colors [2]. The slice of AdS5 is defined by an\nultra-violet (UV) fixed point located at the Planck scale, MP , and an infra-red (IR) one,\nwith an exponentially suppressed scale which is identified as the TeV scale. The 5D metric\nin conformal coordinates is given by:\n\u0012 \u00132\n1\n2\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dz 2 )\n(1.1)\nds =\nkz\nwhere k is the AdS5 curvature. This spacetime has two 4D boundaries at z0 = 1/k \u223c 1/MP l\nand z1 \u223c 1/TeV, respectively the UV and IR boundaries.\nIn order to stabilize the weak scale, the Higgs field must be localized at or near the TeV\nbrane. This is not the case with the rest of the fields, which can then propagate in the AdS5\nbulk. The theories built this way, bulk AdS5 models, not only avoid potentially troublesome\nhigher dimensional operators suppressed only by the TeV scale, but also allow for a natural\nexplanation of the fermion mass hierarchy [3, 4, 5].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fThere are several possibilities for building models of electroweak symmetry breaking in\nAdS5 . The basic elements for building a successful theory include the choice of the bulk\ngauge group, the zero-mode fermion localization and the dynamical mechanism for localizing\nthe Higgs field on or near the TeV brane. The bulk gauge symmetry must be enlarged with\nrespect to the SM in order to include isospin symmetry and avoid tree level contributions to\nthe T parameter. A minimal extension [6] is SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)X , broken by boundary\nconditions either to the SM gauge group SU (2)L \u00d7U (1)Y or directly to U (1)EM as in Higgsless\nmodels [7]. In order to naturally address the fermion mass hierarchy, light fermions must be\nlocalized close to the UV boundary, and heavier fermions, such as the top quark, must be\nlocalized towards the IR brane to have a significant Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field [3, 4].\nFinally, the IR localization of the Higgs can be dynamically achieved in specific models of\nEWSB. For instance, in a Gauge-Higgs unification model [8, 9] in AdS5 , the Higgs arises\nfrom the A5 components of a gauge field and is naturally localized towards the TeV brane, as\nrequired to solve the hierarchy problem; whereas the inclusion of a fourth-generation highly\nlocalized towards the IR brane can result in a condensation of some of the fourth-generation\nzero modes and therefore in a Higgs localized near the IR [10]. IR localization of the Higgs\ncan even be achieved in soft-wall models without an IR brane, as it is shown in Reference [11]\nin a Gauge-Higgs unification model.\nThese bulk AdS5 models of EWSB and fermion masses can be thought of as duals of\nsome strongly coupled 4D theory. They all share a common problem regarding electroweak\nprecision constraints: a tree-level S parameter. This is approximately given by [6, 12]\nStree \u2243 2\u03c0 v 2 z12 ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere v \u2243 246 GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and we took the limit\nvz1 \u226a 11 . For a TeV scale IR brane this results in Stree \u2243 0.3, in contradiction with current\nelectroweak constraints [13]. It is possible to avoid this problem by de-localizing fermions\n[6, 14]. But in doing so, we would loose one of the most interesting features of these theories,\nnamely a natural way of generating the fermion mass hierarchy. In this paper, we will restrict\nourselves to models with light fermions localized near the UV boundary.\nThe presence of the tree-level S parameter in all bulk AdS5 models poses a very stringent\nconstraint on them. It suggests that it would be of interest to study the loop contributions to\nit. In this paper we compute the one loop contributions to the S parameter in these models\ncoming from loops involving the Higgs sector. We will show that the one loop contributions\nto S are logarithmically divergent and therefore require that S be properly renormalized. We\nargue that similar divergences are expected in the fermion and gauge boson loops. The fact\nthat S is logarithmically sensitive to the cutoff should not be completely surprising. From the\npoint of view of the 5D theory, this is the cutoff of the non-renormalizable theory, properly\nwarped down. On the other hand, in the 4D holographic picture, this cutoff corresponds to\n1\n\nIn Gauge-Higgs unification models there is typically an additional suppression given by (v/f\u03c0 )2 , the ratio\nof the Higgs VEV to the symmetry breaking scale [9].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fthe matching of the low energy effective theory and the 4D strongly coupled CFT. A more\nsubtle question is the choice of a renormalization condition for S. Although the logarithmic\ndivergence is sub-dominant in the large N expansion, it could be numerically sizable. Furthermore, the renormalization procedure introduces a scale dependence in the S parameter. All\nin all, the use of the S parameter as a tight constraint on the mass scale of the Kaluza-Klein\n(KK) excitations as well as on the Higgs mass must be reassessed.\nThe plan for the rest of the paper is as follows: in the next Section we present the setup\nof AdS5 bulk models and derive the low energy effective theory obtained after integrating out\nthe 5D bulk; in Section 3 we compute the one-loop contributions of the Higgs sector to the\nS parameter in the effective theory and discuss the renormalization procedure. Finally, in\nSection 4 we discuss our results and conclude.\n\n2. Electroweak Symmetry Breaking in AdS5\nWe consider a 5D model in a slice of AdS, with the gauge symmetry SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R \u00d7U(1)X ,\nbroken to the SM in the UV boundary. The 5D action is given by:\nS=\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd x\n\nZ\n\ndz\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 a\n1 a\n1\naM N\naM N\nMN\ng \u2212 LM N L\n\u2212 RM N R\n\u2212 XM N X\n,\n4\n4\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\na\nwhere LaM N , RM\nN and XM N are the SU (2)L , SU (2)R and U (1)X field strengths, and g is\nthe determinant of the metric.\nThe Higgs field transforms as (2, 2)0 under the gauge symmetry,\n\n1\nH=\u221a\n2\n\nv + h + i\u03c63\ni(\u03c61 + i\u03c62 )\n\ni(\u03c61 \u2212 i\u03c62 )\nv + h \u2212 i\u03c63\n\n!\n\n(2.2)\n\nand it is localized near the IR brane by some suitable mechanism, such as in Gauge-Higgs\nunification [9] or the condensation of a fourth-generation zero-mode fermion [10]. Here it\nsuffices to assume an effective localization on the IR boundary as given by\nSIR =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u221a\n1\ndz \u03b4(z \u2212 z1 ) gIR Tr|D\u03bc H|2 \u2212 V (H) ,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith gIR the induced metric in the IR boundary and V (H) the usual renormalizable Higgs\npotential. The covariant derivative acting on the scalar field is defined as:\nD\u03bc H = \u2202\u03bc H \u2212 ig5 L\u03bc H + ig\u03035 HR\u03bc ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere g5 and g\u03035 are the SU (2)L and SU (2)R 5D gauge couplings, respectively. As usual, in\norder to obtain a canonically normalized Higgs kinetic term, we rescale the Higgs field by\nH \u2192 (1/kz1 ) H.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\f2.1 The Low Energy Effective Theory\nThe presence of the 5D bulk affects the couplings of gauge bosons to the Higgs sector, as\nwell as to fermions. In order to compute the one loop contributions to electroweak precision\nconstraints, we will integrate out the 5D bulk and obtain a low energy theory containing the\nzero-mode gauge bosons and the Higgs. We will use the holographic approach to obtain the\nresulting low energy effective theory, separating the UV degrees of freedom. This is useful\nsince the UV boundary and the bulk respect different symmetries.\n\u221a\nThe Higgs VEV hHi = vI/ 2 breaks the SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R symmetry down to SU(2)V .\nTherefore it is convenient to work in the vector and axial-vector basis in the bulk, defined by\nVM = p\n\nAM = p\n\n1\ng52\n\n+ g\u030352\n1\n\ng52 + g\u030352\n\ng\u03035 LM + g\u03035 RM ) ,\ng5 LM \u2212 g\u03035 RM ) .\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe add the gauge fixing term:\n\nLVGF = \u2212\n\n1\nTr [\u2202\u03bc V\u03bc \u2212 z \u03beV \u22025 (V5 /z)]2 ,\nkz \u03beV\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \u22025 is the derivative with respect to the z coordinate, and there will be similar terms for\nAM and XM . We will take the limit \u03beV,A,X \u2192 \u221e, and obtain \u22025 (V5 /(kz)) = \u22025 (A5 /(kz)) =\n\u22025 (X5 /(kz)) = 0.

In particular, the fact that cV (p)c\u0303V (p) 6= c2A (p) in (2.31) will result in divergences in\nthe one loop calculation of the S parameter.\nWe will also need the quartic interactions given by\nL4eff =\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\nn\no\ng2 1\nL\u03bc (p)L\u03bc1 (k) [(2v + h)h + \u03c621 ]cA (p)cA (k) + (\u03c622 + \u03c623 )cV (p)cV (k)\n8\nn\no\ng2 3\nL\u03bc (p)L\u03bc3 (k) [(2v + h)h + \u03c623 ]cA (p)cA (k) + (\u03c621 + \u03c622 )cV (p)cV (k)\n8\nn\no\ng\u20322\nB\u03bc (p)B \u03bc (k) [(2v + h)h + \u03c623 ]cA (p)cA (k) + (\u03c621 + \u03c622 )c\u0303V (p)c\u0303V (k)\n8\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\ng\u030352 cA (p)\ngg \u2032\ng5 cA (k)\n\u03bc\n[cV (p) + c\u0303V (p)] + 2\n[cV (k) + c\u0303V (k)]\nB\u03bc (p)L1 (k)(v + h)\u03c62\n4\ng52 + g\u030352\ng5 + g\u030352\nn\no\ngg \u2032\nB\u03bc (p)L\u03bc3 (k) \u2212 [(2v + h)h + \u03c623 ]cA (p)cA (k) + (\u03c621 + \u03c622 )c\u0303V (p)cV (k) ,\n(2.32)\n4\n\nA few comments are in order. First, the fact that the gauge-Higgs couplings are modified due\nto the presence of the KK resonances is not particular of the specific symmetry considered.\nFor instance, had we consider instead SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y we would have also obtained shifts in the\ncouplings which are not the same for the different components of the Higgs, and in particular\nwe would still have cV (p)c\u0303V (p) 6= c2A (p). Secondly, if we allow for a Higgs bulk profile, fH (z),\nthe couplings cV , c\u0303V and cA would depend on this profile. However, since the Higgs must\nbe quite localized near the IR brane, the approximation made here (perfect IR localization)\nshould capture the essence of the effects up to small corrections. Also, the couplings in (2.31)\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fentering in the cubic and quartic interactions of (2.30) and (2.32) introduce an additional\ndependence on the external momentum.\nFinally, the effective low energy theory is obtained by integrating the 5D bulk, i.e. it\nis taking into account the effects of all the KK modes. It is also interesting to obtain the\neffective couplings cV , c\u0303V and cA by integrating one or two KK modes and see how rapidly the\nprocess converges. This can be seen in Table 1, where we show the effective couplings at zero\nmomentum for the full 5D bulk integration, the case when only one KK mode is integrated\nout and taken into account, and finally the results obtained with the first two KK modes\n(1)\nintegrated out. These results are approximated (for instance, we assume (MKK )2 \u2243 6/z12 ,\n(2)\nand (MKK )2 \u2243 30/z12 ), but already give a sense of the convergence of the procedure. The\nEff.

The remaining coupling is given by c\u03032V = 2 \u2212 c2V .\n\neffect of the KK modes comes essentially from the mixing of the axial-vector combination\nwith the zero-mode gauge bosons, triggered by the Higgs VEV. We conclude that the KK\npicture is not a bad approximation and the first KK modes do capture the correct physics\nin approximate magnitude and sign. However, and since it is fairly straightforward to obtain\nthe full 5D bulk integration of the holographic picture, we will use the full result obtained in\nSections 2.1 and 2.2.\n\n3. Higgs Contributions to Electroweak Parameters\nSince the couplings between the Higgs sector and the SM gauge bosons are modified by the\npresence of the 5D bulk, we expect effects in the electroweak parameters with respect to the\nSM. In the SM, the Higgs contributions to the S and T parameters are finite because the\npotentially divergent terms cancel when we add the different diagrams. As we will show,\nin the present model the Higgs contribution to S is cutoff sensitive. In the effective theory\ndescribed in the previous section, the shifts in the Higgs couplings to the SM gauge bosons\nwill result in additional contributions to T and S and in particular, in divergent contributions\nto S. Due to the custodial symmetry, there is no tree-level contribution to T , as can be seen\nfrom eq. (2.19), since \u03a011 = \u03a033 = \u03a0L at this order. In the Appendix we explicitly show\nthat the one-loop contribution to T is finite, as expected also from the custodial symmetry,\nas well as from the absence of a counter-term. In what follows we present the calculation of\nthe one loop Higgs contributions to S in the low energy effective theory.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fh\n\n1\n\nL3\n\nL3\n\nB\n\nB\n\n3\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nL3\n\nB\n\nL3\n\nB\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1: One-loop Feynman diagrams contributing to the S parameter involving the Higgs sector.\nThe large dots stand for the effective couplings of eqs. (2.30) and (2.32).\n\n3.1 Contribution to S in the Effective Theory\nThe one loop contributions of the Higgs sector to the S parameter are those depicted in the\nFeynman diagrams of Figure 1. The dots denote the effective couplings in eqns. (2.30) and\n(2.32), obtained by integrating out the 5D bulk.\nAlthough the contributions to one-loop self-energies coming from the gauge sector are\ngenerically gauge dependent, the contributions from the diagrams in Figure 1 to oblique\nelectroweak corrections are separately gauge-invariant. In general, the gauge dependence\nof gauge-boson self-energies is cancelled by vertex and box diagrams which induce pinch\npropagator-like contributions [15]. However, the pinch contributions that affect the diagrams\nof Figure 1 are non-oblique [16], implying that the oblique pieces of these diagrams are gauge\ninvariant. Therefore, the contributions of the diagrams of Figure 1 to oblique electroweak\nparameters are separately gauge invariant.\nNot all contributions from the diagrams in Figure 1 should be considered as contributions\nto S. Some of them are renormalizing the Higgs VEV. In order to see how to identify these\npieces, it is instructive to first turn to the tree-level contribution to S, Stree , as shown in\n(2.27). Since the Higgs is localized on the IR brane, the effects of EWSB must go through\nthe 5D bulk in order to be felt by the UV fields. In particular, the mixing between B and\nL3 caused by the Higgs VEV in the IR brane, picks up a momentum dependence in the\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fbulk, resulting in kinetic mixing, and therefore in a contribution to S given by Stree . The\nloop contributions in Figure 1 are also IR-localized. External momentum dependence arises\nfrom either external momentum in the loop, or the momentum dependent coefficients cA (p),\ncV (p) and c\u0303V (p) appearing in the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons in the effective theory.\nThe latter, is the momentum dependence that the IR-localized loops acquire when going\nfrom the IR brane to the UV, where the elementary gauge bosons are. These contributions\ndo not have external momentum dependence themselves in the IR, and they correspond to\nvarious renormalizations, such as the renormalization of v appearing in Stree in eqn. (2.27).\nThus, as a general rule, genuine contributions to the S parameter are those with external\nmomentum actually flowing through the loop. This amounts to computing the loop diagrams\nwith the effective couplings cA (p), cV (p) and c\u0303V (p) evaluated at zero external momentum.\nThis means, for instance, that the diagram 1-(d) will not contribute to S, but that the\nmomentum dependence from the couplings results in a renormalization of v appearing in\nStree .\nThe diagram 1-(c) gives a finite contribution to S. This can be seen by noticing that the\ncorresponding loop diagram gives\n1(c)\ni\u03a03B (p2 )\n\ng 2 + g\u20322\n=\u2212\n4\n\n\u00012\n\nv 2 cw sw c2A (p)\n\nZ\n\nd4 k 2\nc (p \u2212 k) Gh (k) GZ (p \u2212 k) ,\n(2\u03c0)2 A\n\n(3.1)\n\ncorresponding to the g\u03bc\u03bd coefficient of the diagrams with L3 and B inside the loop, and where\ncw and sw stand for the cosine and sine of the Weinberg angle respectively. In the SM limit,\ncA \u2192 1, these loop diagrams result in finite contributions to S since their derivatives with\nrespect to the external momentum are finite, even if the vacuum polarizations themselves are\ndivergent. In the present case, however, the factor cA (q \u2212k) regulates the vacuum polarization\nitself, since in the large momentum limit cA (k) \u223c e\u2212kz1 . As a consequence, the contributions\nof Figure 1-(c) to S are not only finite but further suppressed. We just denote them as S 1\u2212(c)\nfor the remainder of the paper.\nThe one loop contributions that do result in divergences in the S parameter are those from\ndiagrams 1-(a) and 1-(b). In the SM, these diagrams are responsible for the mh dependence\nin S and are therefore the main source of bounds on mh from electroweak precision bounds.\nUsing dimensional regularization we obtain:\nH\nSloop\n=\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n(N\u01eb \u2212 1) cV (0)c\u0303V (0) \u2212 c2A (0)\n12\u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\nZ 1\nMW\n1\n\u2206\n2\n+\ndx(1 \u2212 x)x cA (0) ln\n\u2212 cV (0)c\u0303V (0) ln\n2\n2\u03c0 0\n\u03bc\n\u03bc2\n+finite terms,\n\nwhere\n\n(3.2)\n\n2\n\u2212 \u03b3 + 1 + ln 4\u03c0 ,\n\u01eb\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u2206 \u2261 xm2h + (1 \u2212 x)MZ2 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nN\u01eb \u2261\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f\u01eb = 4\u2212d, \u03bc is a renormalization scale, and the finite terms come from diagram 1-(c). The first\nterm in (3.2) is divergent in the low energy effective theory that results from integrating out\nthe 5D bulk. The second term2 gives the mh dependence to the S parameter. The SM limit\ncorresponds to taking (cV , c\u0303V , cA ) \u2192 1. From (3.2) we see that in this limit the divergent\nterm cancels, and the second term results in the Higgs contribution to S in the SM:\n\u0001\nH\n2\nSSM\n= (1/12\u03c0) ln m2h /MW\n+ *** .\n\n(3.5)\n\nThus, the result of taking into account the effects of the 5D bulk (or of the strongly coupled\nsector) is twofold: it makes the S parameter UV-sensitive and it modifies its mh dependence.\nIf we regularize the momentum integrals using a cutoff procedure, the divergence in (3.2)\nis logarithmic. In this case the contributions to S from the Higgs sector can be written as\nH\n=\nSloop\n\n\u0003 \u039b2\n1 \u0002\ncV (0)c\u0303V (0) \u2212 c2A (0) ln 2 + finite terms ,\n12\u03c0\n\u03bc\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cutoff of the low energy effective theory. This should be the local IR cutoff,\nwhich is warped down to the TeV scale 1/z1 from the Planck scale k. So we have\n\u039b\u223c\n\n1\n.\nz1\n\n(3.7)\n\nWe conclude that the S parameter in AdS5 bulk theories is logarithmically divergent and\ntherefore cutoff dependent. In order to remove this divergence, the S parameter must be\nrenormalized by choosing a suitable renormalization condition.\n3.2 Renormalization of the S Parameter\nThe one loop calculation of the contributions to S from the Higgs sector fixes the divergent\npart of the counter-term in the renormalization procedure. However, it does not fix the finite\nparts, for which we need a renormalization condition. In order to illuminate the discussion\nwe write the S parameter as\nS = Stree + \u03b4S + Sloop ,\n(3.8)\nwhere \u03b4S is a counter-term. In general, it can be written as\n\u03b4S = \u03b4S div. + \u03b4S finite\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere \u03b4S div. cancels the divergence in (3.2), and the finite part \u03b4S finite is only determined\nby the renormalization conditions. The resulting renormalized S parameter acquires a scale\ndependence and can be written as\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0003\n\u03bc\n1 \u0002\n2\ncV (0)c\u0303V (0) \u2212 cA (0) ln\n,\n(3.10)\nS(\u03bc) = S(\u03bc0 ) +\n12\u03c0\n\u03bc20\n2\n\nIn this gauge the NGBs are massless at this order, and the MZ and MW dependence in (3.2) comes from\nother loops which are finite, such as the one in Figure 1-(c).\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fwhere \u03bc0 is a reference scale and S(\u03bc0 ) is\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\ncV (0)c\u0303V (0) \u2212 c2A (0) + S 1(c) + \u03b4S finite\n12\u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\nZ 1\nMW\n\u2206\n1\n2\ndxx(1 \u2212 x) cA (0) ln\n\u2212 c\u0303V (0)cV (0) ln\n,\n+\n2\n2\u03c0 0\n\u03bc0\n\u03bc20\n\nS(\u03bc0 ) = Stree \u2212\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u2206 is defined in (3.4). As mentioned earlier, the last term in (3.11) contains the Higgs\nmass dependence of the S parameter.\nIn order to determine S(\u03bc0 ) we must choose a renormalization condition, which basically fixes \u03b4S finite . In principle, this could be arbitrarily chosen, for instance to match the\nexperimentally measured value of S at some energy scale, such as\nS(\u03bc0 ) = S exp. (\u03bc0 = MZ ) .\n\n(3.12)\n\nHowever, given that S exp. (\u03bc0 = MZ ) <\n\u223c 0.1, the choice in (3.12) amounts to assume a rather\nefficient cancellation of Stree against \u03b4S finite as well as against the loop contributions. Although\nthis choice does not result in a numerically fine-tuned cancellation, it would imply that the\nleading order contribution to S in the large N expansion,\nStree \u2243\n\nO(1)\nN ,\n\u03c0\n\n(3.13)\n\nis not a good enough approximation and that the next order in N is equally important. In\norder to see this, we define the number of colors N in the 4D CFT in term of the 5D gauge\ncouplings by\n(g2 + g\u0303 2 )\n1\n= 5 25 k ,\n(3.14)\nN\n16\u03c0\nwhich reflects that the large N corresponds to the perturbative expansion in the 5D gauge\ntheory. Thus, the loop diagrams considered here are suppressed contributions in the large\nN expansion. This would mean that a renormalization condition such as (3.12) implies\nthat an O(N ) contribution such as Stree is efficiently canceled by O(1) contributions coming\nfrom loops, which may call into question our use of the large N expansion, i.e. our use of\nperturbation theory in the 5D theory.\nAs concretes examples, we can study two different limits. First we consider m1 z1 \u226b 1,\nwhich corresponds to a heavy Higgs or nearly Higgsless scenario. Using (2.27), results in [7]\n3N\n.\n(3.15)\n4 \u03c0\nTo obtain the one-loop contribution in this limit we need the zero-momentum limit of cV , c\u0303V\nand cA , which results in\n\u0003\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0002\n4 (1 + m1 z1 )g\u030352 + g52 (1 + m1 z1 )g52 + g\u030352\n(3.16)\nc\u0303V (0)cV (0) =\n(2 + m1 z1 )2 (g52 + g\u030352 )2\n4\n,\n(3.17)\nc2A (0) =\n(2 + m1 z1 )2\nStree \u223c\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fwhere m1 is defined in (2.15). Then, taking m1 z1 \u226b 1 and using (3.14) we can see that the\nloop contributions in (3.10) are of order O(1) in the large N expansion. We obtain\nSloop \u223c\n\n\u03bc2\n1\nln 2 .\n12\u03c0\nmh\n\n(3.18)\n\nWe can also consider the limit m1 z1 \u226a 1, in which case we have\nStree \u223c 2\u03c0v 2 z12 ,\n1 \u03c0 2 2\n\u03bc2\nSloop \u223c\nv z1 ln 2 .\nN3\nmh\n\n(3.19)\n(3.20)\n\nA more conservative renormalization condition would be\nS(\u03bc0 ) \u223c Stree ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhich amounts to assume that there is no significant cancellation of the tree-level contribution\nfrom the counter-term or from loop corrections. With this choice, a large positive S parameter\nis still predicted, but the prediction cannot be made precise.\nAlthough the renormalization condition in (3.21) avoids large cancellations of O(N ) and\nO(1) contributions, the finite pieces of the counter-term could still affect significantly the\nloop contributions. In particular, the last term in (3.11) containing the information on the\nHiggs mass, can be affected by the renormalization condition since it is of O(1), just as the\ncounter-term is expected to be. We then conclude than in these theories the S parameter\ncannot be used to put a bound on the Higgs mass.\nThe \"correct\" renormalization condition might be somewhere in between these two extremes, i.e. there may be some cancellation of Stree dictated by the unknown UV (or CFT)\nphysics. In any case, what is clear from our calculation is that the composite, stronglycoupled Higgs sector suffers shifts in its couplings to the SM gauge fields in such a way that\nthe usual cancellations in the diagrams of Figure 1-(a) and Figure 1-(b) do not occur. Thus,\nthis misalignment of the gauge-Higgs couplings with respect to their SM values, results in a\ndependence on the cutoff scale (in the 5D language), or the matching scale with the 4D CFT\n(in the 4D picture).\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nWe have computed the one-loop contributions to the S parameter from the Higgs sector in bulk\nAdS5 theories of EWSB. In these generic 5D setups we have used the minimal extension of the\ngauge group that protects isospin symmetry in the bulk, avoiding a tree-level T parameter.\nOur results show that the S parameter is UV-sensitive and therefore it must be renormalized.\nThe appearance of divergences in S are a consequence of the misalignment between the\ngauge fields in the IR, where they interact with the IR-localized Higgs, and the UV fields\nwhich constitute the elementary degrees of freedom in terms of the holographic picture. This\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fmisalignment is produced by the 5D bulk between the IR and the UV branes, or the strong\ndynamics from the 4D CFT, and it occurs independently of the choice of bulk gauge symmetry.\nThese divergences are then completely generic in bulk AdS5 models of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. Their origin is fundamentally different from the logarithmic divergence found in\nReference [17], which has origin in the mixing of the Higgs with a state resulting from the\nsymmetry breaking pattern in that model. On the other hand, they are similar in spirit to the\nmatching-scale dependence found in References [18] and [19] in a three-site Higgsless model.\nIt is also possible to understand the occurrence of these divergences in a generic operator\nanalysis. For instance, the operator\nOH = (H \u2020 H) |D\u03bc H|2\n\n(4.1)\n\ncontributes to S when inserted in one-loop diagrams. Its contribution is logarithmically\ndivergent and results in\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u039b\ncH v 2\nln\n,\n(4.2)\nS OH \u223c \u2212\n12\u03c0\nm2h\nwhere cH is the corresponding coefficient of OH . On the other hand, we can do the matching\nof this operator to the AdS5 bulk theory. Expanding \u03a0L in eqn. (2.19) to fourth order in v\nat zero momentum, we obtain that\ncH = \u2212\n\ng52 + g\u030352\nk z12 ,\n4\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhich results in a prediction consistent with (3.6). Thus, we see that the divergence in S is\na generic feature in strongly coupled theories, rather than specific to AdS5 bulk models.\nComing back to the AdS5 bulk models discussed in the paper, the renormalized S parameter has a calculable scale dependence given in (3.10). We discussed the possible choices\nof renormalization conditions. Although in principle it is possible to choose an arbitrary\ncondition, so as to adjust the renormalized value of S to any desired value, we showed that\nasking for a significant cancellation of the tree-level value Stree , which is of O(N ) in the large\nN expansion, might be unnatural if the expansion is to be trusted. However, and by the same\nargument, the Higgs mass dependence in S, which appears in (3.11), is of O(1) and therefore\ncan be naturally affected by a renormalization procedure triggered by O(1) one-loop corrections. We then conclude than in these theories there is no bound on the Higgs mass that can\nbe extracted from S.\nWe only computed the one-loop contributions from the Higgs sector. However, we also\nexpect divergent contributions from fermions and gauge bosons. As we have shown, the\ndivergences can be associated with the shifts in the couplings between the SM gauge fields\nlocalized in the UV and the composite fields localized towards the IR. Thus, we expect a\nsimilar effect for composite fermions. These are more model-dependent and we leave their\nstudy for future work.\nWe finally comment on the case where the light fermions are de-localized. The limit of\nexact de-localization, results in flat zero modes. In this limit [6, 14] there is no tree level\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fh,\n\nh,\n\n2\n\n1\n\nL1\n\nL\n\n1\n\n,\n\n1\n\n3\n\nL3\n\nL\n\n3\n\n3\n\n,\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\ni\n\nh,\n\nL\n\n2\n\nLi\n\nLi , B\n(c)\nFigure 2: Relevant one-loop diagrams contributing to the T parameter involving the Higgs sector.\nHere Li = L1 , L3 .\n\nS and we do not expect divergences in the loop contributions. In this case, since the SM\nfermions exactly correspond to the zero modes, the SM gauge fields are also de-localized and\ntheir couplings with the Higgs and fermions are canonical.\n\nA. Higgs Sector Contribution to T\n\nHere we compute the one-loop contributions to the T parameter coming from the Higgs sector.\nThe relevant diagrams are shown in Figure 2. The contributions to T \u221d \u03a011 (0) \u2212 \u03a033 (0) are\nsimilar to the case of the SM, but changing the usual interactions by those of eqs. (2.30-2.32).\nThe effective couplings cV (p), c\u0303V (p) and cA (p) associated to the external legs are evaluated\nat zero momentum. Notice that the NGBs \u03c6i are degenerate at tree level. From eq. (2.30)\nwe can see that the one-loop contributions to T from the Feynman diagrams 2-(a) and 2-(b)\nexactly cancel. We compute now the diagram in Figure 1-(c). In order to see explicitly that\nthis contribution is finite, we work in the diagonal basis {\u03b3, Z}. There are two diagrams\ncontributing to \u03a011 , one with a Higgs field h and another with a NGB field \u03c62 propagating\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fin the loop. This gives:\nZ\nd4 k 2\ng4 v2 2\ni\u03a011 (0) =\ncA (0)\nc (k) Gh GL\n16\n(2\u03c0)4 A\n\u0002 2\n\u00032\nZ\ng5 cA (0) (cV (k) + c\u0303V (k)) + g\u030352 cA (k))\nd4 k\ng2 g\u20322 v 2\n+\n\u00012\n16\n(2\u03c0)4\ng52 + g\u030352\n\n(A.1)\n\n\u00d7G\u03c62 (c2w G\u03b3 + s2w GZ ) ,\n\nwhere Gh,\u03c6i are the propagators of the Higgs and the NGBs and we have factorized the gauge\npropagators as GA\n\u03bc\u03bd = P\u03bc\u03bd GA . On the other hand, the contribution to \u03a033 is given by:\nZ\nd4 k 2\ng4 v2 2\ncA (0)\nc (k) Gh GL\ni\u03a033 (0) =\n16\n(2\u03c0)4 A\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002 2\ng 2 g\u20322 v 2 2\nd4 k 2\n2\n.\n(A.2)\n+\ns\nG\n+\nc\nG\ncA (0)\nc\n(k)\nG\nZ\n\u03b3\nh\nw\nw\nA\n4\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nWe can see that in the one-loop contributions to the T parameter, proportional to \u03a011 (0) \u2212\n\u03a033 (0), the first terms in (A.1) and (A.2) cancel. Also, and just as in the case of the discussion\nof S 1\u2212(c) in Section 3.1, the vacuum polarizations are finite. This is because fV,A (k, z1 ) are\nexponentially suppressed at large momentum, \u223c e\u2212kz1 , implying that also cV (k), c\u0303V (k) and\ncA (k) are. The exponential suppression is due to the Higgs localization in the IR boundary.\nHad we considered a Higgs with a profile in the bulk, we would have obtained a power\nsuppression. All the gauge propagators can be approximated at large momentum, kz1 \u226b 1,\nby 1/(k2 log k). Therefore the integrands of eqns. (A.1) and (A.2) are exponentially suppressed\nfor large momentum and the contribution to T from the Feynman diagram 1-(c) is finite.\nThere are also contributions with only gauge fields running in the loops. Since the difference between the vector and axial correlators is exponentially suppressed at large momentum,\nthese contributions to T are also finite.\nAcknowledgments: We thank Sekhar Chivukula, Roberto Contino, Elizabeth Jenkins,\nRyuichiro Kitano, Aneesh Manohar, \u00c1lex Pomarol and Erich Poppitz for stimulating discussions.
