These new images, with higher surface brightness sensitivity than previous observations, reveal that the large scale structure consists of\nextended filamentary emission bounded by edge-brightened rims. The source is\noffset on one side of symmetrically distributed X-ray emission that is centered on\nthe dominant cluster galaxy NGC 5419. PKS B1400\u221233 is a rare example of a\nrelic in a poor cluster with radio properties unlike those of most relics and halos\nobserved in cluster environments.\nThe diffuse source appears to have had an unusual origin and we discuss\npossible mechanisms. We examine whether the source could be re-energized relic\nradio plasma or a buoyant synchrotron bubble that is a relic of activity in NGC\n5419. The more exciting prospect is that the source is relic plasma preserved\nin the cluster gaseous environment following the chance injection of a radio lobe\ninto the ICM as a result of activity in a galaxy at the periphery of the cluster.\nSubject headings: galaxies: clusters - radio continuum: galaxies - radio sources:\ngeneral, diffuse\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nExtended emission structures with steep radio spectral indices, which are not obviously\nassociated with any optical galaxy, are sometimes observed in rich cluster environments.\nThese sources are broadly separated into cluster wide 'halos' that appear relaxed and symmetric with respect to the X-ray intracluster gas, and the peripheral arc-like structures\nreferred to as 'relics'. Both types are predominantly observed to be associated with hot\n(TX \u2265 6 keV), X-ray luminous (LX > 4 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 ) rich compact clusters (Schuecker\nand B\u00f6hringer 1999); however, the clusters that have peripheral relics may have somewhat\nlower temperatures (Feretti 1999). A standard hypothesis is that these sources are relic\nsynchrotron plasma that has been revived.\nPKS B1400\u221233 is an extended radio source, with an 85 MHz flux density of 57 Jy (Mills,\nSlee and Hill 1960), and has the lowest surface brightness of any source in the Parkes catalog.\nPKS B1400\u221233 appears to be associated with the poor cluster S753 of Abell richness class\n0; however, the source not been conclusively identified with any optical galaxy. Previous low\nfrequency images of the source using the VLA and the MOST (Goss et al. 1987) showed\na relatively bright rim along the NE edge and low surface brightness filamentary emission\ntrailing off to the SW. The source was observed to have a steep spectrum with spectral index\n\u03b1 (S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ) in the range 1.2-2.4.\nThe unusual nature of this possible relic radio source and its potential value as a probe\nof the gas dynamics and evolution of poor cluster environments has led us to carry out new\nradio observations of the source. We have made images with improved surface brightness\nsensitivity at 330 MHz using the Very Large Array (VLA), at 843 MHz with the Molonglo\nObservatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) and at 1398 and 2378 MHz using the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA). Table 1 is a summary of the new radio observations.\nThese are presented here followed by discussions on the origin of this source in the light of\nthe current understanding of the phenomenology and formation of relics in the intracluster\nmedium (ICM).\n\n2.\n\nThe radio continuum images\n\nPKS B1400\u221233 was observed at 330 MHz with the VLA separately in the CnB, C,\nand DnC array configurations in order to image the extended emission in this low surface\nbrightness source. Hybrid arrays were included because of the southern declination. The\ndata were self calibrated and imaged in aips using three-dimensional imaging routines. The\nVLA 330 MHz image of the source is shown in Fig. 1. The image has been made combining\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndata from all the configurations with a beam of FWHM 77 \u00d7 53 arcsec2 at a P.A. of \u221224\u25e6 ;\nthe r.m.s. noise is 2.5 mJy beam\u22121 . This radio image, as well as all the higher frequency\nradio images presented here, has been corrected for the primary beam attenuation.\nBecause of its steep spectrum, the total extent of the diffuse source is best defined by\nthe 330 MHz VLA image. The low surface brightness source is bounded to the NE by a\nrelatively bright rim of emission (marked NE rim in Fig. 1), while the source is bounded\non the opposite SW side by a second fainter ridge of emission (marked SW rim in Fig. 1).\nBoth the bounding rims are concave outwards. The emission that lies between the bounding\nridges is filamentary and decreases in surface brightness from NE towards the SW. The bright\ncompact source that is observed in the image close to the NW edge of the extended source,\nat RA 14h 03m 38.s 7, DEC \u221233\u25e6 58\u2032 39\u2032\u2032 (J2000.0), has a flux density of 0.95 Jy at 330 MHz; the\ncompact source appears slightly resolved and has a deconvolved size of about 25 arcsec. As\ndiscussed below, this compact component is identified with the galaxy NGC 5419. There is\nevidence for a protrusion towards the SW beyond the bounding rim; this extension, marked\nP in Fig. 1, is observed in the 330 MHz image at a level of \u223c 20 mJy beam\u22121 . The total\nflux density of the extended radio source PKS B1400\u221233 is 8.5 Jy at 330 MHz, excluding\nthe emission from NGC 5419 and the source 5.\u2032 5 to its south, marked B in Figs. 1-4, that\nis presumably an unrelated confusing source. The error in the absolute flux density scale at\n330 MHz is believed to be about 2 %.\nThe 843 MHz MOST image of PKS B1400\u221233 is shown in Fig. 2. This image, obtained\nusing the most sensitive 23\u2032 field of view, better reproduces the extended structure than the\n843 MHz image in Goss et al. (1987). The image has been made with a beam of FWHM\n77\u00d743 arcsec2 at a P.A. of 0\u25e6 and has an r.m.s. noise of 1 mJy beam\u22121 . The 843 MHz image of\nthe extended source shows the relatively bright rim along the NE, the filamentary structures\ntrailing from this ridge towards the SW and the curved rim that defines the boundary of\nthe diffuse source at the SW end. The flux density of the extended source (again excluding\nNGC 5419 and the embedded backgound source B) is 1.3 Jy at 843 MHz. NGC 5419 has a\nflux density of 0.46 Jy at 843 MHz. Additionally, the 843 MHz image clearly reveals a local\nemission peak embedded within the diffuse emission at RA 14h 03m 55.s 9 DEC \u221234\u25e6 06\u2032 03\u2032\u2032\n(J2000.0); we hereinafter refer to this feature as component C. It has a flux density of 13\nmJy beam\u22121 at 843 MHz. The flux density scale in the MOST image is accurate to 5 %.\nPKS B1400\u221233 was observed using the 375 m and the 750B 750 m array configurations\nof the ATCA during 1995 Jan and June. Observations were made in two 128 MHz wide\nbands centred at 1398 and 2378 MHz; the bands were covered using 13 channels. The\nextended source was covered with a nine-pointings mosaic with the pointings spaced 8\u2032 apart\nin RA and DEC. Continuum images at the two frequencies were made separately using\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe channel data, adopting a bandwidth synthesis approach to avoid bandwidth smearing\neffects; the mosaic imaging was carried out in aips++. Deconvolution used the multi-scale\nCLEAN algorithm: the bright compact source at the edge of the extended emission was\nfirst removed from the 'dirty' image using a 'box' CLEAN and subsequently a multi-scale\nCLEAN was performed on the residual image. The final images at the two frequencies were\nthen convolved to identical beams of FWHM 70 \u00d7 45 arcsec2 at a P.A. of 0\u25e6 . Consequently,\ndifferent weightings were adopted at the two ATCA frequencies during the imaging step;\nhowever, the convolution to identical final beams implies that the images presented here\neffectively have the same visibility range. ATCA mosaic images of the PKS B1400\u221233 field\nat 1398 and 2378 MHz are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. The r.m.s. noise is 0.5\nmJy beam\u22121 in both images. The relatively bright ridge along the NE and the filamentary\nemission trailing towards SW have been imaged at 1398; however, at 2378 MHz, the ridge\nappears non-uniform and clumpy and the filamentary emission is undetected, possibly due\nto the poorer signal-to-noise ratio. The bounding ridge at the SW of the extended source is\nnot detected in either of these higher frequency ATCA images. The wide-field mosaic images\nshow several continuum sources, presumably unrelated, in the field. Based on the ATCA\ndata, the flux density of NGC 5419 is 0.30 and 0.23 Jy at 1398 and 2378 MHz respectively.\nThe total flux density of the extended source PKS B1400\u221233 is 0.46 and 0.10 Jy at 1398\nand 2378 MHz. The central component C is detected in both the ATCA images with flux\ndensity 5 and 2 mJy beam\u22121 at 1398 and 2378 MHz respectively. The absolute flux density\nscale in the ATCA observations was set using observations of PKS B1934\u2212638 whose flux\ndensity is known, relative to sources in the northern hemisphere, with an uncertainty of 2\n%.\nThe parameters of the radio images presented here are in Table 2. PKS B1400\u221233 has\nan angular size of approximately 24\u2032 \u00d7 14\u2032 . Assuming that the source is at the distance of the\ncluster S753, which is 40h\u22121 Mpc from the Sun (h = H\u25e6 /100, where H\u25e6 is the Hubble constant\nin km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ), the linear dimensions of the extended source are approximately 280h\u22121\nkpc \u00d7 160h\u22121 kpc. The 1.4 GHz radio luminosity of the extended source is 2.2h\u22122 \u00d7 1022 W\nHz\u22121 .\n\n3.\n\nThe distribution of the radio spectral index\n\nThe radio spectra of the extended emission and of the compact source associated with\nNGC 5419 are shown in Fig. 5. Apart from the measurements at 330, 843, 1398 and 2378\nMHz reported here, the plot includes previous estimates of the flux densities of the compact\nand extended sources in Goss et al. (1987) as well as our estimates of the 85 and 408 MHz\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nflux densities of the extended source that are based on the measurements made by Mills,\nSlee and Hill (1960) and Bolton, Gardner and Mackey (1964) and extrapolations of the\nflux density of NGC 5419 to low frequencies.\nThe extended radio source PKS B1400\u221233 (not including NGC 5419 and the background\nsource B) has a mean spectral index \u03b1 = 2.0 between 330 and 1398 MHz. The spectral index\nappears to steepen to \u03b1 = 2.9 between 1398 and 2378 MHz; this may be because of missing\nextended flux density in the 2378 MHz interferometric mosaic image. The 85 MHz data\nindicates a spectral flattening at low frequencies. Our measurements of the flux density of\nthe compact source associated with NGC 5419 are consistent with previous estimates; the\ncompact source has a spectral index \u03b1 = 0.8. The compact source B located 5.\u2032 5 south of\nNGC 5419 has \u03b1 = 0.8 between 843 and 1398 MHz and \u03b1 = 1.0 between 1398 and 2378\nMHz.\nThe images at 330 and 843 MHz were convolved to a final beam of 80\u2032\u2032 FWHM and the\ndistribution of the spectral index, that was computed from these images, is shown in Fig.\n6. Effectively, the two images used for computing the spectral index image have the same\nu,v-coverage. Towards the NE ridge \u03b1 is 1.3-1.4 and towards the SW rim at the opposite\nend of the diffuse source \u03b1 is 1.6\u20131.7. In the region between the two rims, \u03b1 is 1.7 towards\ncomponent C whereas the spectral index is steeper, with \u03b1 in the range 1.8\u20132.4, over most\nof the filamentary emission.\nBetween 1398 and 2378 MHz, the spectral index of the NE ridge is 1.9 and this is steeper\nthan the spectral index between 330 and 843 MHz. Component C, which is detected in both\nthe 1398 and 2378 MHz images, has a spectral index of \u03b1 = 1.7 at these frequencies, similar\nto that between 330 and 843 MHz.\n\n4.\n\nThe optical galaxy environment\n\nThe 330 MHz radio contours are overlaid on a DSS digitization of the UK Schmidt\noptical image of the field in Fig. 7. The bright compact radio source is coincident with\nthe galaxy NGC 5419 which is the dominant galaxy of a cluster listed in the supplementary\ncatalog of Abell, Corwin and Olowin (1989) as S753. This is a poor cluster of Abell richness\nclass 0. Willmer et al. (1991) find that the mean harmonic radius (Maia, da Costa and\nLatham 1989) of the cluster members is 1.26h\u22121 Mpc. This radius corresponds to an\nangular size of 1.\u25e6 8. The extended source PKS B1400\u221233 is located well within the cluster\nradius; however, the source is offset to one side of the central dominant galaxy. Herein we\nassume that PKS B1400\u221233 is at the distance of S753. S753 has a high spiral content (45\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n%) and a low velocity dispersion of 416 km s\u22121 (Willmer et al. 1991). Using different criteria\nfor cluster membership, Fadda et al. (1996) estimate the cluster internal velocity dispersion\nto be 536 km s\u22121 .\nIn the DSS optical image, there are no detectable optical counterparts that are positionally coincident with either the compact radio source 5.\u2032 5 to the south of NGC 5419 or\nthe central component C.\n\n5.\n\nThe thermal gaseous environment\n\nThe cluster is estimated to have a virial mass of 1.5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 (Willmer et al. 1991).\nBased on the velocity dispersion - temperature relation given by Bird, Mushotzky and Metzler (1995), we estimate that isothermal X-ray gas in the relatively low-depth potential well\nwould have a temperature of 2\u20133 keV. A 3 ks PSPC pointed observation of the S753 cluster\nwas recovered from the ROSAT archives. We have examined the 0.1\u20132.4 keV broad-band\nimage of the cluster. There is a bright peak in the X-ray emission at the location of NGC\n5419, which might be emission associated with the interstellar medium of the central galaxy\nor a result of a cooling flow. There is a secondary peak, located about 3.\u2032 6 to the west, that\ndoes not appear to be associated with any cluster member. To detect any low surface brightness diffuse X-ray emission (in the presence of the strong unresolved sources), we convolved\nthe 15\u2032\u2032 pixel counts on the sky image with a Gaussian of FWHM 1\u2032 followed by a box-car\nof width 2\u2032 . A contour representation of this X-ray image is shown in Fig. 8 overlaid on\ngreyscales of the 330 MHz VLA image. A low surface brightness extended X-ray halo component is observed, centered on NGC 5419, with a radius of 16\u2032 (190h\u22121 kpc). The X-ray halo\nappears to surround the radio source PKS B1400\u221233. There is no evidence in this ROSAT\nimage for any deficit or excess of X-ray emission towards the extended radio source. The\nX-ray properties of S753 are typical of poor groups (Mulchaey and Zabludoff 1998), where\nthe X-ray emission is dominated by a component associated with a bright cluster member.\n\n6.\n\nThe anomalously low surface brightness of PKS B1400\u221233\n\nThe physical parameters in those powerful FR II radio galaxies and head-tail and wideangle tail radio sources, which have extended emission structures much bigger than the size\nof the host galaxy, may be useful probes of the surrounding medium (Feretti, Perola and\nFanti 1992; Subrahmanyan and Saripalli 1993). The radio structures that are overpressured\nwith respect to the ambient medium expand in the ambient gas with speeds limited by ram\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\npressure; therefore, derivations of the ambient gas properties depend on a knowledge of the\nexpansion speeds. Radio structures with relatively low surface brightness, like the diffuse\nsource PKS B1400\u221233, potentially have the lowest internal energy densities and pressures,\nand are most likely to be in a static pressure balance with the ambient thermal gas. Therefore,\nthe internal state of such synchrotron plasma might be a direct probe of the surrounding\nthermal environment.\nSubrahmanyan and Saripalli (1993) studied the properties of the synchrotron plasma in\nthe diffuse bridges of the lobes of powerful and giant radio galaxies located in the field. These\nstructures, which lie outside cluster environments and outside the ubiquitous thermal halos\nof the host ellipticals, are among the lowest surface brightness radio components outside\nclusters. These giant bridges have 1 GHz surface brightness \u03c31 GHz \u2248 0.2 Jy arcmin\u22122\n(Subrahmanyan, Saripalli and Hunstead 1996) and the pressure inferred for the synchrotron\nplasma, assuming minimum energy conditions (Miley 1980), is pe =1\u20132\u00d710\u221214 dyne cm\u22122 .\nA study of the internal pressures in the low surface brightness tails of tailed radio galaxies\nin Abell clusters (Feretti, Perola and Fanti 1992) shows that in cluster environments pe\nexceeds 10\u221213 dyne cm\u22122 . The higher pressures inferred for the radio galaxies in clusters are\nconsistent with the relatively higher ambient densities and temperatures in the intracluster\nmedium.\nDiffuse cluster radio sources, which cannot be identified with any active radio galaxy,\nhave a wide range in their surface brightness and pe in the range 10\u221214 \u201310\u221213 dyne cm\u22122\n(Feretti 2002). Among these sources, the peripheral relics, like the arcs in A3667 (R\u00f6ttgering\net al. 1997), have \u03c31 GHz a factor 10 larger than the giant bridges in the field and in\nthis respect they are similar to the tailed radio sources in cluster environments; however,\nthe peripheral relics have been inferred to have a wide range in their pe (see, for example\nFeretti and Giovannini (1996)). The lowest surface brightness radio components in cluster\nenvironments are the diffuse cluster wide halos. Coma C, a prototypical example of such a\nhalo, has \u03c31 GHz \u2248 3 mJy arcmin\u22122 (Kim et al. 1990) and an inferred pe \u2248 8 \u00d7 10\u221215 dyne\ncm\u22122 (Giovannini et al. 1993). Other cluster halo sources are inferrred to have a similar\nlow pe . 10\u221214 dyne cm\u22122 (Feretti and Giovannini 1996). The extremely low synchrotron\nplasma pressure inferred for the halo sources appears inconsistent with their location at the\ncenters of rich clusters. This anomaly might be related to the origin of the halo: the diffuse\nhalos are not identified with any currently active galaxy and are, instead, postulated as being\nreaccelerated relic plasma (Brunetti et al. 2001). The halos are believed to have an origin\ndifferent from the peripheral relics.\nThe surface brightness of PKS B1400\u221233 is about 3 mJy arcmin\u22122 at 1 GHz. If we\nassume that the cm-wavelength spectrum of PKS B1400\u221233 continues with \u03b1 = 2.0 to low\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfrequencies, the inferred pe is 1 \u00d7 10\u221213 dyne cm\u22122 . However, Mills, Slee and Hill (1960)\nmeasured the 85 MHz flux density of the source to be 57 Jy giving the source a mean\nspectral index of \u03b1 = 1.4 between 330 and 85 MHz. This indicates that the spectrum has\na break somewhere in the range 0.1\u20130.3 GHz and that the spectral index flattens towards\nlower frequencies. Assuming a spectral break at 165 MHz with \u03b1 = 0.7 below the break and\n\u03b1 = 2.0 above, we infer pe = 5 \u00d7 10\u221214 dyne cm\u22122 .\nPKS B1400\u221233 appears to be in a poor cluster environment, where the ambient gas\npressure is probably higher than that surrounding the bridges of giant radio galaxies in the\nfield. The cluster in which PKS B1400\u221233 is located has a relatively low inferred gas temperature, a low X-ray luminosity, and the ambient environment is not as extreme as that in\nrich clusters. PKS B1400\u221233 has an extremely low surface brightness very similar to that of\ncluster wide halo sources such as Coma C. However, unlike the halo sources, PKS B1400\u221233\nis not centrally located in the cluster. Additionally, halos are almost exclusively found in rich\nclusters with high velocity dispersions, whereas the cluster environment of PKS B1400\u221233\nis poor. The pe in PKS B1400\u221233 is higher than that in giant bridges in the field as well as\ndiffuse halo sources in cluster centers, but it is not as high as that in tailed radio sources in\nrich clusters. The intermediate value for pe is consistent with PKS B1400\u221233 being a relic\nin a poor cluster environment; however, the surface brightness is relatively low as compared\nto typical relics.\nRood #27 (Harris et al. 1993) is another low surface brightness source in a poor galaxy\nenvironment. This diffuse source is not obviously identified with any optical galaxy and\nappears to be a relic. Rood #27 also has an extremely low \u03c31 GHz but somewhat higher than\nthat of PKS B1400\u221233; additionally, the spectral index of Rood #27 is close to 0.6 and is\nnot as steep as that of PKS B1400\u221233.\n\n7.\n\nOn the nature of the unusual source PKS B1400\u221233\n\nThe extremely steep spectral index (mean \u03b1 = 2) of PKS B1400\u221233 suggests that the\nsource is composed of relic synchrotron plasma in which energy injection has ceased and,\nsubsequently, the spectral index has steepened as a consequence of synchrotron losses (spectral aging). The steep spectrum indicates that there is no on-going or recent reacceleration.\nMoreover, the steep spectrum also suggests that the emissivity of this source has not been\nsignificantly enhanced as a result of adiabatic compression. PKS B1400\u221233 is likely a relic\nof a source that was bright in its youth. Extrapolating the measured flux density of 57 Jy at\n85 MHz to cm wavelengths using a spectral index of \u03b1 = 0.7, we infer that the source would\nhave had a 1 GHz flux density at least 10 Jy prior to any losses. The radio power would\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nhave exceeded 4 \u00d7 1024 W Hz\u22121 at 1 GHz and PKS B1400\u221233 would have been a powerful\nradio source.\nOur estimate that the diffuse source has a pe in the range 5\u201310\u00d710\u221214 dyne cm\u22122 implies\nthat the equipartition magnetic field is 1-2 \u03bcG and spectral aging is predominantly via inverse\nCompton losses against the cosmic microwave background. If we assume that the diffuse\nsource was initially created radiating with a power law spectrum and with spectral index\n\u03b1 < 2, and that the electrons with higher Lorentz factors were depleted as a consequence\nof spectral aging, the spectral break would move below 300 MHz in about 108 yr. If, today,\nthe break is at 165 MHz, the source age is 5 \u00d7 108 yr.\n\n7.1.\n\nA relic created by NGC 5419?\n\nPKS B1400\u221233 has a radio power 0.9 \u00d71023 h\u22122 W Hz\u22121 at 1.4 GHz; before any spectral\naging the radio power may have been higher. Luminous ellipticals with absolute magnitudes\nMR . \u221221 are usually the hosts of extended radio sources with these high radio powers\n(Ledlow 1997). It follows that the host galaxy of PKS B1400\u221233 ought to be a bright\nelliptical with mR . 13.5 (assuming h = 0.5). 11 E/S0 galaxies listed by Willmer et\nal. (1991) to be in S753 are of this magnitude and NGC 5419 is the most luminous.\nNGC 5419 is a bright radio source suggesting that the central engine in the galactic\nnucleus is currently active. However, based on Fig. 7, NGC 5419 is located just outside the\nboundary of the extended source. Moreover, as seen in Figs. 2 and 3, there is an emission gap\nbetween the compact source associated with the galaxy and the extended source. Finally, the\nportion of the extended source closest to the galaxy has a different spectral index (\u03b1 = 1.6)\ncompared with the compact source (\u03b1 = 0.8). Additionally, there is no evidence for any\nspectral index gradient away from NGC 5419.\nNevertheless, it might be that the extended source PKS B1400\u221233 is a relic of past\nactivity in NGC 5419. In this case, the displacement of the extended structure from NGC\n5419 could be due to Rayleigh Taylor instability of the light relic synchrotron plasma embedded in a denser X-ray gaseous environment and at the bottom of the cluster potential\nwell (Churazov et al. 2000). Simulations of the rise of such buoyant bubbles (Churazov et\nal. 2001) indicate that the plasma may initially deform into a torus as it rises and later form\npancake-like sheets at altitudes where the densities of the two-phase medium attain equilibrium. The arc-like boundaries of PKS B1400\u221233 might be fragments of such a global toroidal\nstructure viewed in projection. In this scenario, the relatively flatter spectrum component\nC embedded in the diffuse source might be the past site of nuclear activity.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe 'ghost' cavities that are observed in the Perseus cluster (Fabian et al. 2000) and in\nAbell 2597 (McNamara et al. 2001), are believed to be relic synchrotron bubbles. Buoyancy\nhas been proposed as the mechanism for their displacement from the centers of the clusters.\nIf PKS B1400\u221233 has been displaced from NGC 5419 over the distance of r = 100h\u22121 kpc\nby buoyant forces, we would expect the movement to occur over a timescale\ntb \u2248\n\np\n(\u03c1e /\u03c1ICM ) \u00d7 (r 3 /GM(< r)),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1e is the density of the entrained thermal matter, \u03c1ICM is the density of the thermal\nintra-cluster medium and M(< r) is the gravitational mass of the cluster within radius r.\nWe infer that M(< 100h\u22121 kpc) \u223c 7.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 from the cluster parameters derived by\nWillmer et al. (1991) and, consequently, the timescale of the buoyant motion tb < 1.6 \u00d7 109\nyr. If we assume that the motion takes place in the spectral aging timescale of 5 \u00d7 108 yr,\nwe infer that the ratio of ambient to entrained thermal material is (\u03c1ICM /\u03c1e ) \u2248 10.\nAlternatively, we consider the possibility that the displacement between PKS B1400\u221233\nand NGC 5419 is the result of transverse motion of the galaxy itself. Assuming a timescale\nof 5 \u00d7 108 years and a separation r = 100h\u22121 kpc, the implied transverse velocity is 190h\u22121\nkm s\u22121 . This is consistent with the cluster velocity dispersion and with the peculiar radial\nvelocity of NGC 5419 of 184 km s\u22121 (Willmer et al. 1991). The central component C, which\nhas a relatively flatter spectrum, might be the site where the galaxy was situated when\nactivity in its nucleus created the extended source.\nIn the above scenario, PKS B1400\u221233 was created in the past owing to nuclear activity\nin NGC 5419. Subsequently, the activity ceased, and the current nuclear activity in NGC\n5419 is a new activity phase. The compact radio source associated with NGC 5419 has\na spectral index \u03b1 = 0.6 that is flatter than that observed in the extended emission; this\ngradient is consistent with the hypothesis of restarting activity (see, for example, Roettiger\net al. (1994)). If the spectral age derived for PKS B1400\u221233 is nearly the true age of the\nrelic source, it follows that the nuclear activity in NGC 5419 has restarted in less than 5\u00d7108\nyr. It may be noted that McNamara et al. (2001) derived a timescale of 108 yr for recurrent\noutbursts in the central source of Abell 2597.\n\n7.2.\n\nRelic synchrotron plasma re-energized by shocks in the ICM?\n\nClusters of galaxies are believed to be dynamically evolving at the present epoch, accreting mass components and undergoing mergers, which result in ICM gas density discontinuities that are either shock fronts or cold fronts (Forman et al. 2002). Relic radio sources\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthat have been rendered invisible at cm wavelengths owing to synchrotron losses might be\npresent in the intergalactic medium (Ensslin 1999). Ensslin et al. (1998) have proposed\nthat PKS B1400\u221233 may be relic plasma in which the particles have been reaccelerated by\nthe passage of shocks related to the cluster evolution. In this model, PKS B1400\u221233 may\nhave an origin external to S753.\nSteep spectrum relics are preferentially found at the peripheries of relatively rich clusters\nusually with arc-like morphologies. Examples are the peripheral arc-like source J1324\u22123138\nin A3556 (Venturi et al. 1999) and the arcs in A3667 (R\u00f6ttgering et al. 1997), located on\ntwo opposite sides of the cluster center with no detection of any diffuse extended emission\nbetween. PKS B1400\u221233 does indeed have edge-brightened arcs; however, in this case there\nis diffuse filamentary emission between and, additionally, the entire source is on one side of\nthe cluster center.\nThe morphological peculiarities in this relic might be a result of an unusual projection\ngeometry. However, the parent cluster S753 has a shallow gravitational potential well and\nthe ICM presumably has a relatively low gas pressure. Consequently, relativistic electrons\nthat are distributed over a wider area in the relic plasma may survive radiative losses and be\navailable to be re-energized by a passing shock wave (Ensslin and Br\u00fcggen 2002). The steep\nspectral index of PKS B1400\u221233 (mean \u03b1 = 2) implies a relatively low shock compression\nratio R = 2; this is consistent with the flatter gravitational potential of the poor cluster.\nSimulations of the passage of a shock across a hot magnetized bubble (Ensslin and Br\u00fcggen\n2002) suggest that the relic may transform into an edge-brightened toroidal geometry. The\nmorphology of PKS B1400\u221233 does suggest such an interpretation if the torus is being\nviewed almost face on.\nExtended halos are usually observed in clusters with a low spiral fraction, large velocity\ndispersion and high X-ray luminosity. These are the clusters that are expected to have\nmerger histories and large scale shear and turbulence in the ICM and, consequently, halos.\nHowever, S753 is a poor cluster and, although it belongs to the Centaurus concentration\nof galaxies, it shows no evidence for subclustering (Willmer et al. 1991) or any anomalous\ndistribution in the velocities of its members which might be indications of ongoing or past\nmergers.\nAs compared to other well studied halos and relic sources (Feretti 2002), PKS B1400\u221233\nhas a relatively small linear size and an extremely low radio luminosity. As discussed in\nsection 6, the surface brightness of the source is extremely low, similar to that in cluster\nhalos; however, the inferred pe is more characteristic of cluster relics.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n7.3.\n\nA relic of a lobe injected into the cluster environment?\n\nThe radio galaxy phenomenon, in which beams from an active nucleus power extended\nradio lobes, is believed to be short lived compared to the Hubble time. When the central\nengine switches off, presumably as the fuel is exhausted, the lobes suffer radiative losses that\ndeplete the more energetic electrons and steepen the spectrum. However, expansion losses, if\npresent, quickly render the synchrotron relic invisible because the radio power drops rapidly:\nin an expanding synchrotron bubble with a tangled magnetic field, the spectral luminosity\nfalls as L\u03bd \u223c f \u2212(4\u03b1+2) , where f is the expansion factor (Leahy 1991). For this reason, we\nexpect invisible relics to be present in the intergalactic medium (IGM) where the ambient\ndensities and gas pressures may be lowest, and relics may preferentially be visible in a higher\ndensity medium where expansion losses are smaller.\nA plausible scenario for the origin of a cluster relic like PKS B1400\u221233 would be one\nin which activity in a galaxy located in the vicinity or boundaries of a cluster produced\ntwin beams, of which one resulted in a radio lobe within the ICM and the other oppositely\ndirected beam resulted in a second lobe outside of the cluster gas and in a relatively lower\ndensity IGM. The differences between the environments of the two lobes would be more\npronounced if the double radio source is a giant radio source and the activity axis is aligned\nwith a local gradient in the ambient gas density. Following cessation of nuclear activity in\nthe host, the lobe in the IGM would quickly disappear from radio images, while the lobe\nlocated in the denser ICM would survive as a steep spectrum relic.\nIn this scenario, the extended source PKS B1400\u221233 would be one lobe of a relic double\nradio source. From the viewpoint of such an interpretation, the structure of the radio\nsource (Fig. 1) suggests that the double may have been edge brightened and the NE rim\nof PKS B1400\u221233 (the region with the flattest spectral index) might be the site of past\nhotspots and the end of the double source. The low surface brightness filamentary emission\ntrailing towards the SW from this rim could be the relic cocoon of the backflowing plasma.\nThe overall spectral steepening observed from the NE rim towards the SW (see Fig. 6) is\nconsistent with such a hypothesis. The faint protrusion past the rim along the SW boundary\n(marked P in Fig. 1) might be a relic bridge. We would expect a possible host galaxy to\nlie towards the SW and along the axis defined by the protrusion; a counterlobe, if it is\ndetectable, may be located beyond that.\nTo test this hypothesis, we first searched wide-field NVSS and MOST images of this\nfield for a possible counterlobe along the axis defined by the brightest portion of the NE arc\nand the SW protrusion in Fig. 1. A tentative MOST detection at 843 MHz was followed up\nwith a pointed observation using the 23\u2032 field of view. When smoothed to a resolution of 2\u2032\nFWHM, this observation gives marginal evidence for a very extended source (\u223c50 arcmin2 )\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwith centroid position RA 13h 59m 30s , DEC \u221234\u25e6 47\u2032 (J2000.0) and an integrated flux density\nof 50 \u00b1 12 mJy. We then examined the optical field along the same axis for possible host\ngalaxies. A candidate with mB = 16.7, and classified as S0 by Willmer et al. (1991), was\nfound at RA 14h 02m 18.s 3, DEC \u221234\u25e6 22\u2032 54\u2032\u2032 (J2000.0); it is marked H in Fig. 7. The peak of\nPKS B1400\u221233, the location of galaxy H and the peak of the extended source tentatively\ndetected in the MOST observation are collinear within a few degrees.\nWe subsequently obtained an optical spectrum of galaxy H in the 4000\u20137700 \u00c5 window\nusing the ANU 2.3-m telescope and double-beam spectrograph at Siding Spring Observatory\nin May 2002. Its redshift, z = 0.01695 \u00b1 0.0002, implies a peculiar velocity of 1090 km s\u22121\nrelative to the mean redshift of the cluster. Examining the distribution in galaxy velocities for\na magnitude limited sample towards the cluster (see Fig. 4 in Willmer et al. (1991)), we infer\nthat galaxy H is likely to be a member of S753. It lies 26\u2032 from the center of PKS B1400\u221233,\nimplying a projected separation of 300h\u22121 kpc at the distance of the cluster. The optical\nspectrum shows narrow emission lines of H\u03b1, [N II] and the [S II] doublet; the [N II]/H\u03b1\nand [S II]/H\u03b1 ratios are about 0.25 and 0.22 strongly suggestive of starburst activity (and\nnot emission from an AGN environment).\nAGN-type radio activity usually occurs in elliptical galaxies and the probability of such\nactivity is an increasing function of optical luminosity. Samples of extended radio sources\nshow a sharp decline for hosts with R-band optical luminosity MR & \u221221 (Ledlow 1997). On\nthe other hand, in the cluster Abell 428, Ledlow, Owen and Keel (1998) do find a powerful\nextended radio source 0313\u2212192 associated with an MB = \u221219.9 disk-dominated host that\nis most likely an early type spiral (Sa\u2013Sb). The argument against galaxy H being the host\nof PKS B1400\u221233 is simply that it is even further underluminous, with MB = \u221217.4.\n\n8.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented new and improved radio images of the relic source PKS B1400\u221233.\nWe have discussed the origin of this relic in the light of recent progress in the understanding\nof relic synchrotron plasma in cluster environments. The diffuse source has an extremely\nlow surface brightness and a steep spectrum, with radio properties unlike that of relics and\nhalos observed in cluster environments. The unusual morphology, placement in the cluster\nand physical parameters indicate an unusual origin for this source.\nThe new data does not represent evidence suggesting that the relic source PKS B1400\u221233\nwas created by past activity in NGC 5419. Nor do the observations rule out this possibility.\nThe discussions suggest that PKS B1400\u221233 is not a typical relic. The radio properties\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nsuggest that if the source was created by processes similar to those that form the relics and\nhalos, we might be observing an extreme form of a relic in a poor cluster environment or,\nperhaps, a relic of a re-energized relic. We have presented marginal evidence supportive of\nthe hypothesis that the diffuse source PKS B1400\u221233 was born as a lobe of a powerful radio\ngalaxy; however, we do not have a good candidate for the optical host. The source is unusual and the peculiar radio properties might be indicating an unusual origin: we favour the\ninterpretation that the diffuse source is a relic of a lobe injected into the cluster environment\nas worthy of further consideration, particularly because of the novelty of the proposed phenomenon. Followup low frequency imaging of the field, possibly with the VLA at 74 MHz,\nwith the aim of confirming the MOST detection of a counterlobe and better quality imaging of any low surface brightness connecting features, is proposed as the next step towards\nunderstanding the phenomenology in this unusual source.\nThe Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia telescope which is\nfunded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by\nCSIRO.
