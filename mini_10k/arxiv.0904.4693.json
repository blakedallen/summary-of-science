INTRODUCTION\nThe uniformity of certain abundance ratios in metal-poor\nstars has been proven to be striking (e.g., Cayrel et al. 2004;\nCohen et al. 2004; Arnone et al. 2005; Barklem et al. 2005;\nLai et al. 2008). This uniformity is particularly evident in\nthe \u03b1-element abundance ratios, indicating some combination of a well-mixed interstellar medium (ISM) and common star-formation history for nearby halo metal-poor stars.\nExceptions exist (e.g., Ivans et al. 2003; Aoki et al. 2007b;\nCohen et al. 2007), but these have been rarely seen in surveys\nto date.\nThe study of metal-poor stars, however, has been largely\nconfined to the solar neighborhood, and in effect the innerhalo region. Recent work provides conclusive evidence that\nthere is a population of stars at Galactocentric distances\ngreater than 15 kpc with kinematics, stellar density profile\nand metallicity distribution distinct from that of the inner halo\n(Carollo et al. 2007). The outer halo exhibits a net retrograde\nmotion and is on average composed of more metal-poor stars\nthan the inner halo. Bell et al. (2008) has found evidence for\n\u2217 THE\n\nDATA PRESENTED HEREIN WERE OBTAINED AT THE W.M.\nKECK OBSERVATORY, WHICH IS OPERATED AS A SCIENTIFIC\nPARTNERSHIP AMONG THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATIONAL\nAERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION.

Analysis of nearby stars determined to be members of the outer halo through kinematics\n(e.g., Roederer 2009) have shown an increased scatter in multiple abundance ratios relative to stars that belong to the inner\nhalo.\nThe formation of galaxies by hierarchical merging\nmay provide a ready explanation for these observations.\nBell et al. (2008) showed that their findings of substructure in the halo compared favorably with the simulations\nof Bullock & Johnston (2005), which assumed that merging\nand redistribution of the member stars of satellite galaxies\nformed the halo. Simulations by De Lucia & Helmi (2008)\nfound a more metal-poor outer halo caused by dynamical friction sending the more massive (and therefore more metalrich) satellites into the inner halo, leaving the stars of less\nmassive satellites preferentially in the outer halo. Depending on when these later satellites accreted to form the outer\nhalo, they will leave a signature in both the bulk metallicity\nand \u03b1-abundance signature of its stars (Robertson et al. 2005;\nFont et al. 2006; Johnston et al. 2008). Therefore, by studying stars in the outer halo, we are studying stars from lower\nmass satellites. An example of one of these possible abundance signatures comes from comparing the abundances of\nnearby stars with stars in current day dwarf spheroidals. For\nexample, present day dSphs sometimes show lower [\u03b1/Fe] ratios relative to nearby disk and halo stars (e.g, Shetrone et al.\n2001; Venn et al. 2004).\nTo quantify changes in the stellar populations at large\nGalactocentric radius, we have initiated a program to measure the abundances for a large sample of metal-poor stars in\nthe outer halo. Using the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey to select candidates, and the ESI instrument to obtain more detailed followup spectra, we have discovered SDSS J234723.64+010833.4\nto have anomalous [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] abundance ratios, and\nto be unique (to our knowledge) in its [Mg/Ca] ratio of \u22121.21.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTIONS\n\nAs part of the SEGUE survey, low-dispersion spectra have\nbeen obtained for \u223c240,000 stars, including stars specifically\ntargeted for low metallicity (Yanny et al. 2009). Atmospheric\n\n\f2\n\nF IG . 1.- The H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines for SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 (solid\nline), HD 122563 (long dashed line), and CS 31078-018 (short dashed line).\nThe Balmer lines from HD 122563 give a very good match to those measured\nin SDSS J234723.64+010833.4.\n\nparameters and metallicities are derived from these spectra\nby the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP; Lee et al.\n2008a,b; Allende Prieto et al. 2008). From these stars, we\nhave selected a sample of stars with [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22122.0 and Galactocentric distances \u2265 15kpc (as determined from the surface\ngravity estimate) for follow-up observations. For stars, this\ndistant and faint (V \u2243 16.5 and greater), a very efficient spectrograph is needed to obtain a reasonable sample size. For this\nstudy, we use the ESI spectrometer on Keck 2 (Sheinis et al.\n2002). The 0\".75 slit was used, which results in a resolving\npower of R \u223c 6000. The efficiency and wavelength coverage of ESI (useable for detailed abundance analysis between\n\u223c4000 an 7000 \u00c5) makes this well suited to this study, though\nthe trade-off between efficiency and resolution limits the number of elements that we can measure. It is in this sample that\nwe observed SDSS J234723.64+010833.4.\nOn 2008 August, 29 (UT) we obtained three 1500 s exposures of SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 (g = 17.23). We\nachieved a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 40 per pixel at 4170\n\u00c5, increasing to 115 per pixel at 6200 \u00c5. The spectra were\nreduced and extracted using the MAKEE package.9 Equivalent widths were measured using the SPECTRE program\n(Fitzpatrick & Sneden 1987). The measured EWs along with\nline parameters are available upon request (with atomic parameters taken from Lai et al. 2008).\n3. STELLAR PARAMETERS AND ANALYSIS\nWe follow the general treatment outlined in Lai et al. (2004,\n2007) to determine the atmospheric parameters and perform\nthe LTE spectral analysis for this star. We have expanded the\nnumber of species measured to include Na I and Fe II, and\nalso use a Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model atmosphere with\nno convective overshooting.\n9\n\nhttp://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/tab/makee/\n\nWe obtained initial atmospheric parameters of 5108 K for\nTeff , 2.15 for log g, and [Fe/H] = \u22122.2 from the SSPP. In the\ncourse of the analysis we found a large correlation between\nthe excitation potential (EP) and Fe I abundances for individual Fe I lines. We need to adjust the SSPP temperature by\napproximately \u2212600K to bring this correlation below the 2-\u03c3\nlevel. However, this is a large correction and is based on only\n16 Fe I lines. As an additional check we compared the H\u03b1\nand H\u03b2 line profiles to stars with better determined Teff and\nwith ESI spectra from Lai et al. (2004). In Figure 1 we show\nthis comparison to HD 122563 and CS 31078-018, stars with\nsimilar Teff to the EP-corrected Teff and SSPP Teff of SDSS\nJ234723.64+010833.4, respectively (Mashonkina et al. 2008;\nLai et al. 2008). The SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 Balmer\nline profiles very closely match those of HD 122563 (Teff =\n4600K), but are not a good fit to those of CS 31078-018 (Teff =\n5257K). At present, the origin of this rather large offset in Teff\nremains unclear, but in examining our larger sample it seems\nto only be present for some stars with Teff < 4900K. The\nmetallicity offset is easier to understand. The high [Ca/Fe]\ncontributes to the offset in [Fe/H] with respect to the SSPP\nvalue. Several of the metallicity indicators in the SSPP use the\nCaII K line strength (Lee et al. 2008a), so the unusually high\n[Ca/Fe] value would be expected to bias the SSPP-adopted\nmetallicity upward. Combined with the Teff offset, this in\nlarge part explains the metallicity difference.\nThis much lower Teff may also indicate the log g from the\nSSPP should be changed. Given the similarity to HD 122563\nin Teff , one reasonable choice is to adopt its log g of 1.5 for\nSDSS J234723.64+010833.4. As a check on the log g of the\nstar, we compare the Fe I to the Fe II abundance. While we\nonly measure two Fe II lines (at 4583.8 and 4923.93 \u00c5), we\nfind that the Fe I and Fe II abundances agree within reasonable\nerrors using the SSPP atmospheric parameters, but are completely inconsistent when using the lower Teff . However, using the log g of HD 122563 for SDSS J234723.64+010833.4\ngives a much better agreement between the two species.\nWe ultimately adopt the Teff of HD 122563, as given in\nMashonkina et al. (2008) for SDSS J234723.64+010833.4,\nmotivated by the match in the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines of the two stars\nand minimized EP trend of Fe I lines. We also adopt the log g\nof HD 122563 predominately because of this Teff match, with\nthe similar abundances of Fe I and Fe II giving confidence to\nthis choice. We then use Equation (7) from Kirby et al. (2008)\nto derive the microturbulent velocity (vt ), which is based on\nlog g. Our final adopted atmospheric parameters for [Fe/H],\nTeff , log g, and vt , are \u22123.2, 4600 K, 1.50, and 1.94 km s\u22121 ,\nrespectively. Cross correlating with a radial velocity standard,\nwe measure a heliocentric radial velocity of \u2212225 km s\u22121 .\n3.1. Error estimates\nAlthough we adopt Teff of 4600 K, motivated both by reducing the EP-abundance trend of Fe I lines and the Balmer\nline similarity to HD 122563, lowering the Teff by an additional 200 K would even better eliminate the EP-abundance\ntrend in the Fe I lines. We therefore adopt 200 K as the error\non Teff . We also adopt 0.5 dex as our error on log g, as it is\nat this level the condition of ionization balance between Fe I\nand Fe II begins not to be well met (because of the paucity\nof Fe II lines, we define this to be a difference of 0.3 dex between the two species). While the equation used for vt gives\na good approximation of typical values for a given log g, we\ncan estimate its error based on the trend of abundances given\n\n\f3\nTABLE 1\nA BUNDANCE S UMMARY\nElement\nName\nFe\nFeII\nC\nNa\nMg\nCa\nTiI\nTiII\nCr\nSrII\nBaII\nEuII\n*\n\n[X/Fe]\n\n\u03c3\nLines\n\nNumber of\nLines\n\nTotal\nError\n\n\u22123.17\n\u22123.18\n\u22120.28\n\u22120.23\n\u22120.10\n1.11\n0.39\n0.57*\n\u22120.05\n< \u22120.50*\n< \u22121.50*\n< \u22120.50*\n\n0.18\n0.11\n0.20\n***\n0.24\n0.09\n***\n0.24\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n16\n2\n***\n1\n4\n6\n1\n5\n1\n***\n***\n***\n\n0.21\n0.20\n0.26\n0.22\n0.15\n0.08\n0.22\n0.13\n0.21\n***\n***\n***\n\n[X/Fe II].\n\nby individual Fe I lines with EWs.

We estimate the uncertainties from atomic parameters and EW measurements with the standard error of the\nabundances measured from multiple lines of the same species.\nWhen only one line of a certain species is measured, we estimate a conservative error of 0.2 dex due to these factors.\nTo estimate the final errors on our abundance ratios, we\nadopt the technique described in Johnson (2002) (Equations\n(5) and (6)). This includes cross-terms for the dependence\nof Teff and log g (a decrease of 200K would necessitate a\ndecrease of \u223c0.3 in log g to maintain reasonable ionization\nequilibrium) and one taking into account the dependence of vt\nwith log g.\n4. RESULTS\nThe abundance measurements, number of lines measured\nfor each element, standard deviations of these lines, and final total error estimates are summarized in Table 1. We note\nthat if we used the atmospheric parameters from the SSPP, the\nabundance ratios would remain essentially the same, but the\noverall metallicity would be shifted higher to [Fe/H]\u223c \u22122.6.\nIn particular, the [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] ratios are relatively insensitive to changes in the atmospheric parameters.\nIn Figure 2, we show a Mg and Ca line from our spectrum of SDSS J234723.64+010833.4. We also plot the\nsame lines from a spectrum of HD 122563, which as discussed above should have very similar atmospheric parameters. Even without additional analysis, we can see that SDSS\nJ234723.64+010833.4 is very enhanced in [Ca/Fe] and low\nin [Mg/Ca] compared to HD 122563. The determination of\nthe Mg abundance comes from the 4703.0, 5172.7, 5183.6,\nand 5528.4 \u00c5 lines, with EWs ranging from 20.1 to 156.9\nm\u00c5.The determination of the Ca abundance comes from the\n4226.7, 4425.4, 5588.8, 6122.2, 6162.2, and 6439.1 \u00c5 lines,\nwith EWs ranging from 76.9 to 348.5 m\u00c5. As can be seen\nin Table 1, the individual lines of Mg and of Ca are in good\nagreement with each other.\nIn Figure 3 we plot the [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] of SDSS\nJ234723.6+010833.4. The [Mg/Fe] is clearly lower than the\nvast majority of stars; the only stars that show similarly high\n[Ca/Fe] ratios come from the carbon-enhanced metal poor\n(CEMP) stars compiled by Aoki et al. (2007a). However,\n\nF IG . 2.- A Mg line at 5183 \u00c5(top plot) and a Ca line at 6162 \u00c5(bottom\nplot) from SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 (solid line), and HD 122563 (long\ndashed line). HD 122563 has a [Fe/H]= \u22122.6 and relatively normal [\u03b1/Fe]\u223c\n0.2. SDSS J234723.64+010833.4, which has [Fe/H]= \u22123.17 should have\nweaker noticeably weaker lines if this were a typical [\u03b1/Fe] enhanced MP\nstar. However, while the Mg is clearly weaker, the Ca line is actually stronger\nrelative to the same line in HD 122563.\n\nAoki et al. (2007a) mentions that there are numerous C2 and\nCN features in the wavelength range of the Ca lines measured in their highest [Ca/Fe] stars, and that this may be\nartificially biasing the [Ca/Fe] values high in their CEMP\nstars. Also, unlike the stars in Aoki et al. (2007a), SDSS\nJ234723.64+010833.4 has a very low carbon abundance, and,\nas shown in Figure 4, its [Mg/Ca] rato of 1.21 \u00b10.13 is truly\ndifferent from other metal-poor stars. This value is 0.5 dex\nlower then the next lowest star, and would be even more\ndistinct if we ignore the high [Ca/Fe] stars from Aoki et al.\n(2007a). As discussed further below, most stars that exhibit\nanomalous \u03b1-abundances have similar [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe],\nor high [Mg/Ca].\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nThe typical explanation for uniformly low or high \u03b1abundance ratios in a star is that it came from a different\nstellar formation environment compared to the nearby halo.\nSpecifically, that the time-scale and incidence of SN Ia versus SN II can account for the differences (see, e.g., Figure\n1 in McWilliam 1997). This basic explanation can also explain the \u03b1 deficiencies found in current day dSphs (e.g.,\nShetrone et al. 2001, 2003; Venn et al. 2004) and high space\nvelocity stars that may belong to the outer halo (Fulbright\n2002; Stephens & Boesgaard 2002). While the low [Mg/Fe]\nof SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 may favor this scenario, the\nvery high [Ca/Fe] suggests that there is much more going on.\nOn the other end of the scale from SDSS\n\n\f4\n\nF IG . 4.- In terms of [Mg/Ca], SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 Is unique. The\nsymbols are as in the previous figure. It is clear from this figure that most\nstars that exhibit anomalous \u03b1-abundance ratios have either a normal or high\n[Mg/Ca], not the very low value exhibited by SDSS J234723.64+010833.4.\n\nF IG . 3.- [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] for SDSS J234723.6+010833.4 (the filled\nstar), along with data from multiple other recent studies. Most of the measurements are for nearby halo stars: the large circles are from Lai et al.\n(2008), the x symbols are from Aoki et al. (2007a,b) and references therein,\nthe diamonds are from Cayrel et al. (2004), the triangles are from Cohen et al.\n(2008, 2004), the asterisks are from Ivans et al. (2003), the plus signs are\nfrom Barklem et al. (2005), and the small circles are from Lai et al. (2004).\nWe have also included abundances measured in dSph galaxies. These are\nplotted as the squares and come from Frebel et al. (2009); Koch et al. (2008);\nFulbright et al. (2004); Shetrone et al. (2003, 2001) (green in the electronic\nversion). The only stars that seem to match the high [Ca/Fe] are the CEMP\nstars from the study of Aoki et al. (2007a).\n\nJ234723.64+010833.4 are the high [Mg/Ca] stars. These\nseem to come in two types, stars with high [Mg/Fe] ratios\nbut normal [Ca/Fe] ratios (Aoki et al. 2007b), or low [Ca/Fe]\nwith normal [Mg/Fe] (Cohen et al. 2007). As discussed\nin Cohen et al. (2007), this behavior may arise because of\nthe difference in nucleosynthesis mechanisms between Mg\nand Ca, hydrostatic and explosive \u03b1-burning, respectively\n(Woosley & Weaver 1995). This suggests that in the progenitor(s) of SDSS J234723.6+010833.4, the products of\nexplosive nucleosynthesis dominated the ejecta as compared\nto the products of hydrostatic burning. Measurements of\nSi (an explosive \u03b1-burning product) and O (a hydrostatic\n\u03b1-burning product) could greatly bolster this argument,\nhowever these two elements have transitions that require\nbluer wavelength coverage and higher-resolution spectra than\nESI can provide.\nThe low [C/Fe] of this star is of particular note. Combined\nwith the low [Ba/Fe] upper limit, this indicates that the atmosphere has not been polluted by a companion that has gone\n\nthrough its asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. While it\nis possible that this star has processed some of its original C\nto N, and therefore began with a higher original [C/Fe] abundance ratio, it is unlikely that enough C was burned that this\nstar was ever a CEMP star ([C/Fe]>1). However, if somehow a significant portion of its C has been converted to N\ninternally, then some of its Mg may also have been processed\nto Al through proton burning in layers with T\u2265 70 \u00d7 106 K.\nIf a mixing event that brought this C-depleted material to\nthe surface was also deep enough to bring some of this Mgprocessed material to the surface, then the surface Mg abundance would have been diluted and may partially explain the\nlow observed [Mg/Fe] value. While this is unlikely, in part because field stars do not show a correlation of Mg with Al (e.g.,\nGratton et al. 2004) and we measure a relatively low [Na/Fe]\nabundance ratio (which one would expect to be enhanced in\nthis scenario), further observations of this star to determine its\nAl abundance can determine the validity of this scenario.\nIf we assume that the low [Mg/Ca] was not the consequence of processed material from a companion or internal to the star itself, then this unique abundance ratio was\npresent in the ISM that originally formed the star. This indicates either a unique SN progenitor or mix of progenitors\ngiving rise to the [Mg/Ca] abundance ratio. There do exist\nmetal-free SN II models that can produce low [Mg/Ca] ratios (Heger & Woosley 2008), and we find that these generally fall in between the 10 and 18 M\u2299 range. However, because of the limited number of abundances that can be measured from our spectrum, we are prevented from performing these fits with confidence. Regardless, stars like SDSS\nJ234723.64+010833.4 must be exceedingly rare (at least in\nthe inner halo) given that this is the first such star to display\n\n\f5\nsuch a ratio. Clearly, this star is not a product of the wellmixed ISM which seems to characterize the inner halo. As\nsuch, it is an intriguing candidate for being the product of a\nsingle unique progenitor and, combined with its metallicity,\nmakes it a possible true second-generation star (Tumlinson\n2006). A more detailed high-resolution analysis of this star is\nneeded before a more definitive statement can be made.\nAn open question is whether this is a unique star formation environment in the outer halo. Using its estimated surface gravity and measured g magnitude applied to\nthe isochrones from Girardi et al. (2004), we estimate that\nSDSS J234723.64+010833.4 is located approximately 40 kpc\nfrom the Galactic center (and \u223c 32 kpc below the Galactic\nplane), well into the outer-halo region as defined from the\nCarollo et al. (2007) measurements. In addition to the observational evidence of a distinct outer-halo component, simulations have also shown that an inner\u2013outer stellar halo structure will arise assuming the hierarchical merging picture (e.g,\nDe Lucia & Helmi 2008; Bullock & Johnston 2005), with\nsmall satellites merging to form the outer halo. This suggests\nthat the outer stellar halo is composed of stars from many different star-formation environments. This possibility is hinted\nat by the study of Roederer (2009), which finds increasing\nchemical abundance diversity for stars that have orbits that\nbring them to the outer-halo region as compared to stars which\nsolely exist in the inner halo.\nWhile this star does not resemble any abundances measured\nin dSphs to date, in the scenarios described by the studies\nabove it is possible that it once belonged to a system that was\naccreted into the outer-halo region. The discovery of more\nanomalous stars like SDSS J234723.64+010833.4 in the outer\nhalo could be a significant step in completing the picture for\n\nhow the stellar halo formed. It is noteworthy that this star\nwas discovered in a sample of only 27 in situ outer-halo stars.\nThis suggests that, while obviously rare, we may discover additional such stars as we increase our sample of outer halo\nstars with available detailed abundance measurements.\n\nFunding for the SDSS and SDSS-II has been provided by\nthe Alfred P.
