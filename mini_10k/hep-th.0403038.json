The restricted holonomy group of the cone is then a subgroup of\nSU(m+1). There are various other, more-or-less equivalent, definitions. For example,\nX2m+1 may also be defined as a Riemannian manifold which admits two1 non-trivial\nsolutions to the Killing spinor equation \u2207X \u03c8 = \u00b1 12 iX * \u03c8, with appropriate signs. Alternatively, the Sasakian-Einstein condition may be phrased in terms of the existence\nof a certain type of contact structure \u2013 indeed, this was Sasaki's definition. These\nconditions are all equivalent, provided X2m+1 is simply-connected and spin [1].\nThere has been particular interest in Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifolds recently due to\ntheir importance in the AdS/CFT correspondence [2]. For example, AdS5 \u00d7 X5 , with\nsuitable self-dual five-form flux, is a supersymmetric solution of type IIB supergravity\nthat is expected to be dual to a four-dimensional superconformal field theory arising\nfrom a stack of D3-branes placed at the tip of the corresponding Calabi\u2013Yau cone\n[3, 4]. The superconformal field theories will preserve at least N = 1 supersymmetry\n[3, 4, 5, 6]. Similarly, AdS4 \u00d7X7 , with appropriate four-form flux, is a supersymmetric\nsolution of eleven-dimensional supergravity that is expected to be dual to a threedimensional superconformal field theory arising on a stack of M2-branes sitting at the\ntip of the corresponding metric cone. The superconformal field theories will preserve\nat least N = 2 supersymmetry2 [3, 4, 5, 6].\nRecall that every Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold possesses a constant-norm Killing vector, V (for some general discussion see e.g. [7]). Indeed, in the contact structure definition, V is part of the geometric data. We thus have a one-dimensional foliation, and\nit is easy to show that the transverse geometry is locally K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein of positive\ncurvature. If the orbits of V close, then we have a U(1) action. Since V is nowhere\nvanishing, it follows that the isotropy groups of this action are all finite. Thus the\nspace of leaves of the foliation will be a positive curvature K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein orbifold\nof complex dimension m. Such Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifolds are called quasi-regular. If\nthe U(1) action is free, the space of leaves is actually a K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold and\nthe Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold is then said to be regular. Moreover, the converse is\ntrue: there is a Sasaki\u2013Einstein structure on the total space of a certain U(1) bundle\nover any given K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold of positive curvature [8]. A similar result is\ntrue in the quasi-regular case [7]. If the orbits of V do not close, the Sasaki\u2013Einstein\nmanifold is said to be irregular.\nAlthough there are many results in the literature on Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifolds\nin every dimension, explicit metrics are rather rare. Homogeneous regular Sasaki\u2013\nEinstein manifolds are classified: they are all U(1) bundles over generalised flag\nmanifolds [1]. This result follows from the classification of homogeneous K\u00e4hler\u2013\n1\n\nWhen m = 3 one can have weak G2 holonomy manifolds admitting a single solution to the\nKilling spinor equation. In higher dimensions this is not possible \u2013 see, e.g. [1].\n2\nIf X7 has weak G2 holonomy, so that the metric cone has Spin(7) holonomy, then the D = 11\nsolutions will be dual to field theories with the minimal N = 1 supersymmetry, while N = 3 theories\narise as duals to tri-Sasakian X7 .\n\n1\n\n\fEinstein manifolds. For example, in low dimensions with m = 1, 2, 3 the homogeneous\nbase is either CP 1 , CP 2 , CP 1 \u00d7CP 1 , CP 3 , CP 2 \u00d7CP 1 , CP 1 \u00d7CP 1 \u00d7CP 1 , SU(3)/T 2 or\nGr5,2 . The corresponding homogeneous Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifolds are, in the physics\nliterature, denoted S 3 , S 5 , T 1,1 , S 7 , M 3,2 , Q1,1,1 , N 1,1 , V5,2 , respectively (see for\ninstance [9] for a review). Notice that inhomogeneous K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifolds are\nknown to exist (including cohomogeneity one examples), and are explicit up to a\nfunction which satisfies a certain ODE \u2013 see, e.g. addendum C of [10]. One may then\nconstruct the associated regular Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifolds.\nHowever, until recently, there have been no known explicit inhomogeneous metrics\nin the quasi-regular class. Previous constructions3 of such manifolds use methods in\nalgebraic geometry which imply existence of solutions, but do not produce explicit\nmetrics. Moreover, no irregular examples were known to exist at all. In [12], we constructed a countably infinite family of explicit cohomogeneity one Sasaki\u2013Einstein\nmetrics on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 . These were discovered by dualising one of the class of M-theory\nsolutions of [13]. This family gives not only the first explicit examples of inhomogeneous quasi-regular Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifolds, but also the first examples of irregular\ngeometries. In this note we show that this construction extends to every dimension.\nMore precisely, we prove the following:\nFor every positive curvature 2n-dimensional K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold B2n , there\nis a countably infinite class of associated compact, simply-connected, spin, Sasaki\u2013\nEinstein manifolds X2n+3 in dimension 2n + 3. Hence each X2n+3 admits a Killing\nspinor and the holonomy of the associated metric cone is a subgroup of SU(n + 2).\nMoreover, the isometry group of X2n+3 is at least G \u00d7 T 2 , where G is the isometry\ngroup of B2n .\nNote that there is also a straightforward generalisation to the case where B2n is a\nproduct of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifolds [14].\n\n2\n\nThe local metric\n\nLet B2n be a (complete) 2n-dimensional positive curvature K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold,\n \u0303 Recall that complete Einstein manifolds with\nwith metric ds\u03032 and K\u00e4hler form J.\npositive curvature are necessarily compact [15] and hence B2n is compact. In addition,\nwe note that a positive curvature K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold is simply-connected [8].\nNow, as shown in [16], [17], the local metric\nd\u015d2 = U(\u03c1)\u22121 d\u03c12 + \u03c12 U(\u03c1)(d\u03c4 \u2212 A)2 + \u03c12 ds\u03032\n\n(2.1)\n\nis then a positive curvature K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric in dimension 2n + 2, where 2J \u0303 =\ndA and\n\u0012 \u0013n+2\n\u03bb\n\u03ba\n\u03bb\n\u039b\n\u039b\n2\nU(\u03c1) =\n\u2212\n\u03c1 +\n(2.2)\n2n+2\n2n + 2 2n + 4\n2(n + 1)(n + 2) \u039b\n\u03c1\n3\n\nVery recently an infinite class of explicit inhomogeneous Einstein metrics have been constructed\nin [11]. It is not known if any of these are Sasaki\u2013Einstein.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere \u03ba is a constant that has been rescaled compared to [17] for later convenience.\nThe K\u00e4hler form is given by\nJ\u02c6 = \u03c12 J \u0303 + \u03c1(d\u03c4 \u2212 A) \u2227 d\u03c1\n\n(2.3)\n\nand the curvatures of the K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics in dimensions 2n and 2n + 2 are\nf = \u03bbg\u0303, Ric\nc = \u039b\u011d.\n\u03bb > 0 and \u039b > 0, respectively. Thus Ric\nIn [17] it was shown that the local expression (2.1) describes a complete metric\non a manifold if and only if the base is CP n , with its canonical metric, and the\nresulting total space is then CP n+1 , again with canonical metric. This requires the\nchoice \u03ba = 0 [17]. For this reason, the local one-parameter family of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein\nmetrics (2.1) (with \u039b > 0) has been largely ignored for more than 20 years.\nHowever, consider adding another dimension to the metric above \u2013 specifically,\nthe local Sasaki\u2013Einstein direction. We define the (2n + 3)-dimensional local metric\nds2 = d\u015d2 + (d\u03c8 \u2032 + \u03c3)2\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u02c6 As is well-known (see, e.g. [18] for a recent review), such a metric is\nwhere d\u03c3 = 2J.\nlocally Sasaki\u2013Einstein, with curvature 2n+2, provided \u039b = 2(n+2).

A straightforward calculation then shows that the local metric\n(2.4) assumes the following form\nds2 = U(\u03c1)\u22121 d\u03c12 + \u03c12 ds\u03032 + q(\u03c1)(d\u03c8 + A)2 + w(\u03c1) [d\u03b1 + f (\u03c1)(d\u03c8 + A)]2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere4\nw(\u03c1) = \u03c12 U(\u03c1) + (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b)2\n\u03bb2 \u03c12 U(\u03c1)\nq(\u03c1) =\n\u039b2 w(\u03c1)\n\u03c12 (U(\u03c1) + \u03c12 \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b)\nf (\u03c1) =\n.\nw(\u03c1)\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nIn order to have a Riemannian metric we must certainly ensure that U \u2265 0, w \u2265 0,\nq \u2265 0.

As we want to exclude\n\u03c1 = 0, since the metric is generically singular there, we thus take \u03c1i to be both positive\n(without loss of generality). Moreover, w > 0 provided \u03c12i 6= \u03bb/\u039b. If we define\nx=\nwe can write\nU(\u03c1) =\n\n\u039b 2\n\u03c1\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n1\nP (x; \u03ba)\nn+1\n2(n + 1)(n + 2) x\n\n(2.12)\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere we have introduced the polynomial in x\nP (x; \u03ba) = \u2212(n + 1)xn+2 + (n + 2)xn+1 + \u03ba .\n\n(2.14)\n\nFor any x \u2265 0 (for fixed \u03ba), a zero of U(\u03c1) corresponds to a root of the equation\nP (x; \u03ba) = 0. Observe that the only turning points of P (x; \u03ba) on the interval [0, \u221e)\nare at x = 0 and x = 1 where the latter is a global maximum. When \u03ba is positive it\nis straightforward to see that there is only a single real root and so this is excluded.\nSimilarly, when \u03ba < \u22121 there are no real roots and this is also excluded. We thus\nconclude that in the range\n\u22121<\u03ba\u22640\nthere are two distinct suitable values of the roots \u03c1i\nq\nq\n\u03bb(n+2)\n\u03bb\n.\n0 \u2264 \u03c11 < \u039b < \u03c12 \u2264 \u039b(n+1)\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe limiting value \u03ba = 0 in (2.1) gives rise to a smooth compact K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein\nmanifold if and only if B2n = CP n , in which case the resulting space is CP n+1 .\nClearly the corresponding Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold X2n+3 , defined by (2.4), is S 2n+3\n(or a discrete quotient thereof). As a consequence, we now focus on the case where\nthe range of \u03ba is \u22121 < \u03ba < 0.\n\n3\n\nGlobal analysis\n\nWe first analyse the (2n + 2)-dimensional part of (2.7), transverse to the \u03b1 direction,\nand show that, with appropriate ranges and identifications of the coordinates, it is\na smooth complete metric on the total space of an S 2 bundle over the original 2ndimensional K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold B2n . This is true for any value of the constant\n\u03ba, with \u22121 < \u03ba < 0. We will also show that the resulting (2n + 2)-dimensional\nRiemannian manifold Y2n+2 is in fact conformally K\u00e4hler. Secondly, we show that\nthe \u03b1 direction can be made into a U(1) fibration over the base Y2n+2 for countably\ninfinitely many values of the parameter \u03ba in the allowed range. The total space of the\nfibration is then a (2n + 3)-dimensional Einstein manifold. In the following section\nwe show that it is Sasaki\u2013Einstein.\n\n4\n\n\fThe base\nWith the range of \u03c1 being \u03c11 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c12 we see that, if \u03c8 is periodically identified, the\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c8 part of the metric (2.7) at fixed point on the base B2n is a circle fibred over the\nline segment with coordinate \u03c1, where the size of the circle goes to zero at the two\nroots \u03c1 = \u03c1i . This fibre will be a smooth S 2 provided the period of \u03c8 can be chosen\nso that there are no conical singularities where the circle collapses. Now, near a root\n\u03c1i we have U(\u03c1) \u2248 U \u2032 (\u03c1i )(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1i ). Defining the new coordinate\nR2 =\n\n4(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1i )\nU \u2032 (\u03c1i )\n\n(3.1)\n\nthe \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c8 part of the metric (2.7), at any fixed point on the base, is\ndR2 +\n\n\u03bb2 \u03c12i U \u2032 (\u03c1i )2 2 2\nR d\u03c8\n4\u039b2 (\u03c12i \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b)2\n\n(3.2)\n\nnear to the root \u03c1 = \u03c1i . Now we notice the remarkable fact that\n\u03c12i U \u2032 (\u03c1i )2\n= \u039b2\n(\u03c12i \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b)2\n\n(3.3)\n\nfor any root. Therefore the circle fibre collapses smoothly at both roots provided that\n\u03c8 has period 4\u03c0\n. The \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c8 fibre is then topologically S 2 .\n\u03bb\nf = \u03bbg\u0303, we see that dA is 2 times the Ricci form of\nNow, since dA = 2J \u0303 and Ric\n\u03bb\nthe base manifold B2n . Since the period of \u03c8 is 4\u03c0\n, at fixed value of \u03c1 between the\n\u03bb\nroots, the resulting circle fibration is just the associated U(1) bundle to the canonical\nbundle of B2n . Indeed, note that one may rescale the coordinate \u03c1, as well as the\nother variables and coordinates, so as to set \u03bb = 2. Then the period of \u03c8 is the\ncanonical value of 2\u03c0, and dA is the Ricci form. We may therefore set\n\u03bb=2\n\u039b = 2(n + 2)\n\n(3.4)\n\nwithout loss of generality, where the second condition ensures that the Sasaki\u2013Einstein\nmetric has curvature 2(n + 1). We will often still keep factors of \u03bb and \u039b in formulae,\nwith the understanding that they take the above values.\nBefore studying further topological properties of these spaces, we remark that the\nspaces Y2n+2 are complex manifolds. Moreover, these manifolds are in fact conformally\nK\u00e4hler. Specifically, consider the fundamental two-forms\nJ\u00b1 = \u03c12 J \u0303 \u00b1\n\n\u03bb\n\u03c1\np\nd\u03c1 \u2227 (d\u03c8 + A)\n\u039b w(\u03c1)\n\nand the associated (n + 1, 0)-forms\n#\n\"\np\nd\u03c1\n\u03a9\u00b1 = \u03c1n \u03a9\u0303 \u2227 p\n\u00b1 i q(\u03c1) (d\u03c8 + A) .\nU(\u03c1)\n5\n\n(3.5)\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fOne finds that one can write d\u03a9\u00b1 as\nd\u03a9\u00b1 = L\u00b1 \u2227 \u03a9\u00b1\n\n(3.7)\n\nfor suitable one-forms L\u00b1 , which shows that Y2n+2 is complex, with complex structure\nspecified by \u03a9\u00b1 . Moreover, it is immediate that\n!\n2\n\u03bb\n1\ndJ\u00b1 =\n1\u2213 p\nd\u03c1 \u2227 J\u00b1\n(3.8)\n\u03c1\n\u039b w(\u03c1)\n\nwhich implies that Y2n+2 is conformal to a K\u00e4hler manifold.\nWe have now constructed a complete manifold Y2n+2 which is the total space of\nan S 2 bundle over B2n . Let us denote the canonical bundle of B2n as L. Then Y2n+2\nmay be thought of as the manifold obtained by adding a point to each C fibre of L\nto obtain a CP 1 = S 2 bundle over B2n . We can write this bundle as L \u00d7U (1) CP 1 .\nThis notation means that one uses the U(1) transition functions of L to make an\nassociated CP 1 bundle, where U(1) acts isometrically on CP 1 in the usual way.\nNotice that one can also write this as P(L \u2295 O), where O is a trivial complex line\nbundle over B2n and P denotes projectivisation (i.e. one quotients out by the Hopf\nmap C2 7\u2192 C2 /C\u2217 = CP 1 = S 2 on each C2 fibre of the bundle L \u2295 O).\nWe will later need a basis for the second homology group of Y2n+2 , in terms of a\nbasis for the base manifold B2n . In general we have H2 (B2n ; Z) \u223c\n= Zr \u2295 torsion, where\nr is the rank. We will not need to know anything about the finite part (as we will\nbe integrating two-forms over the basis). Since \u03c01 (B2n ) is trivial, note that, by the\nuniversal coefficients theorem, we have H 2 (B2n ; Z) \u223c\n= Zr is torsion-free. Now, we can\nfind r submanifolds \u03a3i , i = 1, . . . , r, such that their homology classes [\u03a3i ] provide\na basis for the free part of the second homology group of B2n . Recall that Y2n+2 is\nthe total space of a CP 1 = S 2 bundle over B2n . In fact, since this is a projectivised\nbundle, we can use the results of section 20 of [19] to write down the cohomology ring\nof Y2n+2 in terms of B2n . In particular, we note that H 2 (Y2n+2 ; Z) \u223c\n= Z \u2295 H 2 (B2n ; Z),\nwhere the first factor is generated by the cohomology class of the S 2 fibre. By Poincar\u00e9\nduality, notice that we can find r cohomology classes \u03c9i \u2208 H 2 (B2n ; Z), i = 1, . . . , r,\nsuch that h\u03c9i , [\u03a3j ]i = \u03b4ij . Also notice that the rank of H2 (Y2n+2 ; Z) is then r + 1.\nNow let \u03c3 N : B2n \u2192 Y2n+2 denote the section of \u03c0 : Y2n+2 \u2192 B2n corresponding\nto the \"north pole\" of the S 2 fibres. This is clearly a global section. Also define a\nsubmanifold \u03a3 \u223c\n= S 2 of Y2n+2 corresponding to the fibre of Y2n+2 at some fixed point\non the base B2n . Then since \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9i , \u03c3\u2217N [\u03a3j ] = h\u03c9i , [\u03a3j ]i = \u03b4ij , we see that {\u03a3, \u03c3 N \u03a3i }\nforms a representative basis for the free part of H2 (Y2n+2 ; Z).\nNow, since Y2n+2 is simply-connected, note that we have\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n2\n2\n\u223c\n\u03bd \u2208 Z, \u2200Z \u2282 Y2n+2 , \u2202Z = \u2205\nH (Y2n+2 ; Z) = [\u03bd] \u2208 Hde Rham (Y2n+2 ) :\n(3.9)\nZ\n2\n\u2261 Hde Rham (Y2n+2 ; Z) .\nThus a closed two-form \u03bd corresponds to an integral cohomology class under the\nmap H 2 (Y2n+2 ; Z) \u2192 H 2 (Y2n+2 ; R) if and only if the periods h\u03bd, [Z]i over our basis\nZ \u2208 {\u03a3, \u03c3 N \u03a3i } are all integral.\n\n6\n\n\fWe conclude this section with two technical comments. First, note that Y2n+2\nis always a spin manifold, irrespective of whether B2n is spin or not. One way to\nsee this is to view Y2n+2 as the total space of the unit sphere bundle in the associated R3 bundle, E. Then w2 (E) = w2 (LR ) = c1 (L) mod 2. But also w2 (B2n ) =\nc1 (B2n ) mod 2 = \u2212c1 (L) mod 2. We may then use the Whitney formula to compute w2 (T E) |B2n = w2 (E) + w2 (B2n ) = 0, where we view E as the normal bundle to\nthe zero section B2n of E. Since B2n is a deformation retract of the total space of E,\nthis is enough to show that the total space of E, and therefore its boundary Y2n+2 ,\nare spin. Secondly, the S 2 bundle Y2n+2 will not in general be trivial. It was shown\nin [12] that if n = 1 and B2 = S 2 then Y4 \u223c\n= S 2 \u00d7 S 2 , but this is a low-dimensional\nexception. Using standard techniques one can show that the first Pontryagin class\nof the SO(3) bundle Y2n+2 is c21 (L) \u2208 H 4 (B2n ; Z). In fact this can never be trivial\nfor n \u2265 2 since, for a K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold B2n , c1 (L) is proportional to the\nK\u00e4hler class [J \u0303], and J \u0303n is proportional to the volume form, which is a non-trivial\ncohomology class. In particular, c21 (L) must be non-trivial.\n\nThe circle fibration\nWe now turn to the \u03b1 direction in the metric (2.7). The latter may be written\nds2 = ds2Y2n+2 + w(\u03c1)(d\u03b1 + B)2\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere B = f (\u03c1)(d\u03c8 + A). Since for the range of \u03ba chosen the function w > 0, the\nKilling vector \u2202/\u2202\u03b1 is nowhere vanishing on the base Y2n+2 . The idea now is that, if\nl\u22121 B is a connection one-form, where l \u2208 R is some real number, then by periodically\nidentifying \u03b1 with period 2\u03c0l we obtain a complete metric on the total space of the\nU(1) bundle over Y2n+2 with connection one-form l\u22121 B. We will find that a countably\ninfinite number of values of \u03ba work.\nNotice that at fixed value of \u03c1 between the two roots, B is proportional to the\n1\nglobal angular form 2\u03c0\n(d\u03c8 + A) on the resulting \"equatorial\" U(1) bundle. This is of\ncourse globally defined on this space. However, crucially, the function f (\u03c1) does not\nvanish at the poles. Since the azimuthal angle \u03c8 is not defined at the poles the oneform B is not well-defined on the whole manifold Y2n+2 . However, it is straightforward\nto verify that dB is a globally defined smooth two-form on Y2n+2 . We now address\nthe question of when such a closed two-form is the curvature of a connection on a\ncomplex line bundle. In fact, this is the case precisely if the periods of the two-form\nare integral. Indeed, we have\n2\nVectC1 (Y2n+2 ) \u223c\n= H 2 (Y2n+2 ; Z) \u223c\n= Hde\n\nRham (Y2n+2 ; Z)\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere the notation VectC1 (Y2n+2 ) denotes isomorphism classes of complex line bundles over Y2n+2 , and the second isomorphism is true only for a simply-connected\nmanifold Y2n+2 (otherwise one misses the torsion). Any closed two-form \u03bd, with\n2\n[\u03bd] \u2208 Hde\nRham (Y2n+2 ; Z), is then the curvature of a U(1) bundle (divided by 2\u03c0).\n1 \u22121\nThus we must ensure that the periods of 2\u03c0\nl dB are integers, for some l \u2208 R. In\nthis case, l\u22121 B is a local connection one-form. The reason that it is not defined\n\n7\n\n\fglobally (specifically, at the poles) is that, for a non-trivial bundle, the connection\nl\u22121 B is only defined in local coordinate patches, and there are gauge transformations\nat the intersections of the patches. The singular nature of B is due to the fact that\nwe are trying to use only one patch for a non-trivial bundle.\n1\nThe periods of 2\u03c0\ndB over our representative basis {\u03a3, \u03c3 N \u03a3i } for the free part of\nH2 (Y2n+2 ; Z) are easy to compute:\nZ\ndB\n= f (\u03c11 ) \u2212 f (\u03c12 )\n(3.12)\n\u03a3 2\u03c0\nZ\n\n\u03c3 N \u03a3i\n\ndB\n= f (\u03c12 )c(i) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.13)\n\nHere\nc(i) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3i\n\ndA\n= hc1 (L), [\u03a3i ]i \u2208 Z\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.14)\n\nare the Chern numbers. Thus we see that, if f (\u03c11 )/f (\u03c12 ) = p/q \u2208 Q is rational (with\np, q \u2208 Z), then the periods of [q/2\u03c0f (\u03c12)] dB are {p \u2212 q, qc(i) }. Clearly, these are all\n1 \u22121\nl dB has integral periods\ninteger. Moreover, if we set h = hcf{p \u2212 q, qc(i) } then 2\u03c0\nwith no common factor, where l = hf (\u03c12 )/q. Notice that, using the expression (2.10),\nwe have\nR(\u03ba) \u2261\n\n\u03c12 (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b)\nx1 (x2 \u2212 1)\nf (\u03c11 )\n= 21 22\n=\n,\nf (\u03c12 )\n\u03c12 (\u03c11 \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b)\nx2 (x1 \u2212 1)\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere xi are the associated roots of the polynomial (2.14). This is a continuous\nfunction of \u03ba in the interval (\u22121, 0]. Moreover, it is easy to see that R(0) = 0 and\nin the limit R(\u22121) = \u22121, and hence there are clearly a countably infinite number of\nvalues of \u03ba for which R(\u03ba) is rational and equal to p/q, with |p/q| < 1, and these all\ngive complete Riemannian manifolds.\n\nThe global Sasaki structure on X2n+3\n\n4\n\nWe denote the manifold with metric (2.7), and appropriate value of \u03ba, by X2n+3 . By\nconstruction, this is a complete, compact Einstein manifold. Moreover, since X2n+3\nis the total space of a U(1) fibration over a simply-connected manifold Y2n+2 , it is\nstraightforward to calculate \u03c01 (X2n+3 ). Indeed, notice that, again by construction,\nthe Chern numbers have no common factor, and hence it follows that X2n+3 is also\nsimply-connected5 . Note also that w2 (X2n+3 ) is just the pull-back of w2 (Y2n+2 ) = 0,\nand so X2n+3 is a spin manifold.\nThe local metric (2.4) that we started with is Sasaki\u2013Einstein. The Sasaki condition means that there exists a certain contact structure. This may be phrased in\n5\n\nLook at the Thom-Gysin sequence for the U (1) fibration \u2013 cf. appendix A of [12].\n\n8\n\n\fterms of the existence of certain geometric objects which satisfy various algebraic\nand differential conditions. Specifically, the contact structure involves the Killing\nvector V = \u2202/\u2202\u03c8 \u2032 , its dual \u03c7, and the (1, 1) tensor constructed by raising an index\nof d\u03c7 with the metric. Since these objects already locally satisfy the appropriate\nalgebraic and geometric conditions, we simply have to check that they are globally\nwell-defined, given the identifications and ranges we have taken in order to make a\ncomplete manifold.\nIn terms of the coordinates (2.7) the unit-norm vector V is easily computed to be\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u039b \u2202\n.\n(4.1)\n\u2212\nV =\n\u03bb \u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03b1\nThis is clearly globally defined, as each of the vectors \u2202/\u2202\u03c8, \u2202/\u2202\u03b1 is globally defined.\nMoreover, the dual one-form \u03c7 may be written\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\n\u039b\n2\n\u03c7= \u03c1 \u2212\n[d\u03b1 + f (d\u03c8 + A)] + q(\u03c1)(d\u03c8 + A) .\n(4.2)\n\u039b\n\u03bb\nThe function (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03bb/\u039b) is smooth on X2n+3 , and the one-form [d\u03b1 + f (d\u03c8 + A)] is\nproportional to the global angular form on the U(1) fibration U(1) \u0592\u2192 X2n+3 \u2192 Y2n+2 ,\n1\n(d\u03c8+A) on the \"equatorial\nso is globally defined on X2n+3 . The global angular form 2\u03c0\nU(1) bundle\" contained in Y2n+2 at fixed \u03c1, \u03c11 < \u03c1 < \u03c12 , is not defined at the poles\nof the S 2 fibres of Y2n+2 , but the function q(\u03c1) vanishes smoothly there, so in fact the\nsecond term is also globally defined on X2n+3 . Clearly \u03c7 and also d\u03c7 are smooth and\nglobally defined. We conclude that the local Sasaki structure is globally well-defined,\nand thus X2n+3 is a simply-connected spin Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold.\nAs discussed in [7], the restricted holonomy group of the metric cone on a Sasaki\u2013\nEinstein manifold X2n+3 is a subgroup of SU(n + 2). Since our manifolds X2n+3\nare simply-connected, it follows that the metric cone C(X2n+3 ) has holonomy group\ncontained in SU(n + 2), and is therefore a Calabi\u2013Yau cone. Thus, from [20], there\nexists a parallel spinor on C(X2n+3 ) which projects down to a Killing spinor on X2n+3 .\nNotice that the orbits of the Killing vector V close if and only if f (\u03c12 ) \u2208 Q. In\nthis case the Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold is said to be quasi-regular, which means that\nthe space of leaves of the foliation determined by V is a K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein orbifold.\nDetermining when f (\u03c12 ) \u2208 Q seems to be a non-trivial number-theoretic problem.\nFor the case n = 1 studied in [12] one has to solve a quadratic diophantine, which can\nbe done using standard methods. However, there is no general approach for solving\nhigher-order diophantines. If f (\u03c12 ) is irrational, the orbits of V are dense in the torus\ndefined by the Killing vectors \u2202/\u2202\u03c8, \u2202/\u2202\u03b1. In this case the Sasaki\u2013Einstein manifold\nis said to be irregular, of rank 2. There is no well-defined K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein base in this\ncase. These remarks are of course consistent with [17] where it was shown that the\nlocal K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric (2.1) is a complete metric on a manifold only if \u03ba = 0.\nFor the countably infinite number of values of \u03ba found here, the K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein\n\"base\" is at best an orbifold, and in the irregular case there is in fact no well-defined\nbase at all.\n\n9\n\n\f5\n\nConnection with previous results\n\nIf we introduce the new coordinates \u03c12 = (\u03bb/\u039b)(1 \u2212 cy) and \u03b2 = c\u03c4 , the metric (2.1)\ncan be cast in the following form\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u03bb\n1\n\u03bb\n2\n2\n2\nd\u015d = (1 \u2212 cy)ds\u0303 +\ndy +\nF (y)(d\u03b2 \u2212 cA)2\n(5.1)\n\u039b\nF (y)\n2\u039b\nwhere\nF (y) =\n\n2\u039b\n[a \u2212 y 2 Qn (1 \u2212 cy)]\n(n + 1)(n + 2)\n(1 \u2212 cy)n\n\n(5.2)\n\nwith the constant a \u2261 (\u03ba + 1)/c2 and Qn is a polynomial of degree n given by\nQn (x) =\n\nn\nX\n\n(i + 1)xi .\n\n(5.3)\n\ni=0\n\nThe range of a, for c = 1, is given by 0 < a \u2264 1.\nWe are now in a position to recover the form of the five-dimensional metrics, as\npresented in [12]. Indeed, this is achieved by setting n = 1, \u03bb = 2 and \u039b = 6 to\nobtain\n2(a \u2212 3y 2 + 2cy 3 )\n.\n(5.4)\nF (y) =\n1 \u2212 cy\nAs a further example, we note that seven-dimensional Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics corresponding to n = 2, \u03bb = 2 and \u039b = 8 have\nF (y) =\n\n4\na\n3\n\n\u2212 8y 2 + 32\ncy 3 \u2212 4c2 y 4\n3\n(1 \u2212 cy)2\n\n(5.5)\n\nWhen c is non-zero we can always choose c = 1 by rescaling y. On the other\nhand when c = 0 we can recover known Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics. Setting c = 0,\nusing the fact that Qn (1) = 21 (n + 2)(n + 1), and introducing the new coordinates\ny 2 = (2a/\u039b) cos2 \u03c9 and \u03b2 \u2032 = [a\u03bb2 /2(n + 2)(n + 1)]1/2 \u03b2, we find that the metric (2.1)\nbecomes\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n\u03bb\nd\u03c9 + sin2 \u03c9(d\u03b2 \u2032)2\n(5.6)\nd\u015d2 = ds\u03032 +\n\u039b\n\u039b\nwhich is just the direct product metric on B2n \u00d7 S 2 . The corresponding Sasaki\u2013\nEinstein metrics (2.4) are then appropriate U(1) bundles over B2n \u00d7 S 2 and are\nclearly regular. For instance, with n = 1 so that B2 = CP 1 , the c = 0 limit gives the\nhomogeneous space T 1,1 /Z2 (or T 1,1 ) [12]. Similarly, for n = 2, explicit metrics are\nobtained by taking B4 to be CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 or CP 2 , and the corresponding homogeneous\nSasaki\u2013Einstein seven-manifolds are Q1,1,1 and M 3,2 , respectively. The new Sasaki\u2013\nEinstein metrics in seven dimensions that we have presented here, for the special\ncases with B4 given by CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 and CP 2 , are co-homogeneity one generalisations\nof Q1,1,1 and M 3,2 , respectively.\n\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nDM is funded by an EC Marie Curie Individual Fellowship under contract number\nHPMF-CT-2002-01539.
