Because of their size,\nhigh frequency operation, small mass and high performance, NEMS are currently considered promising candidates for achieving the quantum limit of mechanical motion. It is expected that the quest for the quantum regime\nin such devices will elucidate questions of fundamental\nnature in physics, for instance, the quantum-mechanical\ndescription of macroscopic objects [8\u201313]. Similarly,\nphysical systems involving NEMS resonators are excellent tools for theoretical and experimental studies of\nnonlinear dynamical systems [14, 15]. Indeed, examples\nof complex dynamical phenomena in NEMS are numerous and include chaotic behavior [16\u201319], bifurcationtopology amplification [20], nonlinear switching dynamics [21] and nonlinear frequency pulling [22] to name but\na few.\nBy making use of the potential offered by NEMS resonators, G. Sonne et al. [23] studied the nonlinear dynamics of a suspended carbon nanotube coupled to two\nvoltage biased superconducting electrodes. In presenting\ntheir work, Sonne and collaborators assumed that the\nnanoelectromechanical junction was subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field perpedicular to the axes of the\nnanowire. For such a system, the authors demonstrated\nthe possibility to pump energy from the electronic subsystem into the mechanical vibrations; they also demonstrated that the system had more than one regime of\nfinite-amplitude stationary nonlinear oscillations. In particular, a region of bistability was found and the authors\nshowed that it should be detected in the corresponding\ndc Josephson current (see discussion in Ref. 23).\nIn this article, we consider the same voltage-biased\nnanoelectromechanical system studied by Sonne and coworkers [23], but now we extend the analysis to the case\nin which the NEMS resonator is subjected to a nonuniform magnetic field. As will be discussed below, inhomo-\n\ngeneity of the field causes the conducting nanoresonator\nto execute a whirling movement resembling a jump-rope\nlike motion. The purpose of this paper is to analyze\nthe time evolution of the amplitude and relative phase\nof the nanotube whirling motion. We will demonstrate\nthat the coupled amplitude-phase dynamics exhibit different stationary regimes depending on the degree of the\nmagnetic field inhomogeneity: time independent, periodic and chaotic.\nThe scope of this article is parallel to research conducted by Conley et al. [24] and Chen et al. [25], who previously investigated nonlinear and nonplanar dynamics\nof suspended nanowires excited by an electrostatic force.\nHere, however, we consider another type of driving mechanism: the Laplace force. This excitation mechanism to\naccomplish whirling motion of suspended nanoresonators\nhas not been considered before.\nThe article is organized in the following manner. In\nSec. II we introduce the model Hamiltonian for the considered system and examine the coupling between the\nmechanical and electronic subsystems. At the end of the\nsection, we derive the equations of motion governing the\ndynamics of the nanoresonator driven by an ac Josephson\ncurrent. In Sec. III we obtain the differential equations\nfor the time evolution of the amplitudes of the nanotube\nvibration and discuss their dynamics through the analysis\nof the numerically computed results. Finally, in Sec. IV\nwe provide the summary and concluding remarks of this\nwork.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL HAMILTONIAN SYSTEM\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a superconducting hybrid nanostructure, a superconductingnormal-superconducting (S-N-S) nanoelectromechanical\nJosephson junction driven by a dc voltage bias V . The\njunction consists of a metallic carbon nanotube of length\nL suspended between two voltage-biased superconducting leads. In such a geometry, the nanotube is simultaneously serving as a mechanical resonator and as a weak\nlink between the superconducting electrodes. In the lay-\n\n\f2\nand the bulk superconducting leads, Ax is the magnetic vector potential in the x-direction and \u03c3\u0302i are the\nPauli matrices. The superconducting electrodes are described by \u0124\u2206 , where the gap function is given by\n\u2206(x) = \u22060 \u0398(2|x| \u2212 L), with \u22060 the order parameter and\n\u0398(x) the Heaviside step function. The phase difference\nbetween the superconducting leads is denoted by \u03c6 and,\nin accordance to the second Josephson relation, its time\nevolution is \u03c6(t) = \u03c9J t, with \u03c9J = 2eV /~ the Josephson\nfrequency.\nWe now consider a magnetic field of the form H =\n(0, Hy , Hz ), which can be generated, for instance, by an\nMFM cantilever tip in the form of a wedge, cf. Fig. 1. A\nfirst order Taylor expansion of the magnetic field yields\nH = (0, y\u2202y Hy (x, 0, 0), Hz (x, 0, 0) + z\u2202z Hz (x, 0, 0)),\nwhere Hz (x, 0, 0) and \u2202i Hi (x, 0, 0) represent the magnitudes of, respectively, the magnetic field z-component\nand the magnetic field gradients, both evaluated at\nthe axis of the nanotube. A straightforward calculation from the Maxwell equation \u2207 * H = 0, indicates\nthat \u2202y Hy (x, 0, 0) = \u2212\u2202z Hz (x, 0, 0) \u2261 \u2212Hz0 . Setting\nHz (x, 0, 0) \u2261 Hz , the magnetic field reads\nH = (0, \u2212Hz0 y, Hz + Hz0 z) .\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic diagram of the voltagebiased S-N-S nanoelectromechanical Josephson junction considered in the article. A doubly clamped metallic carbon nanotube suspended over a trench of length L, forms a weak link\nbetween two voltage-biased superconducting electrodes. The\njunction is influenced by an inhomogeneous magnetic field H,\ngenerated by a wedge-shaped MFM cantilever tip at a distance d from the nanotube at rest (blue circle). (b) Nanotube\ndisplacement (green circles) in the z-y plane induced by a\nLaplace force. RT is the curvature radius of the magnetic tip.\n\nout of the system, the NEMS junction is under the influence of an external inhomogeneous magnetic field H, generated by a magnetic force microscope (MFM) cantilever\ntip parallel to the axis of the nanotube at a distance d.\nAs demonstrated by Sonne et al. [23], the electronic\nsubsystem can be effectively modeled in terms of the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u0124 = \u03a8\u0302 (x) \u01240 + \u0124\u2206 \u03a8\u0302(x)dx ,\n(1a)\n\u0012\n\u00132\n~2\n\u2202\nieAx\n\u03c3\u0302z\n\u2212 \u03c3\u0302z\n+ \u03c3\u0302z U (x) ,\n2m\n\u2202x\n~\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0124\u2206 = \u2206(x) \u03c3\u0302x cos \u03c6(t) + sgn(x)\u03c3\u0302y sin \u03c6(t) .\n\u01240 = \u2212\n\n\u2020\n\n(1b)\n(1c)\n\nHere, \u03a8\u0302(x) and its complex conjugate \u03a8\u0302 (x) are twocomponent Nambu spinors that annihilate and create electrons/holes at position x, respectively. In the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equation, \u01240 is the Hamiltonian for electrons/holes in the metallic carbon nanotube,\nwhere U (x) is the potential barrier between the tube\n\n(2)\n\nThis field is also obtained from the equation H = \u2207 \u00d7 A,\nwhere the vector potential A is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\nA = \u2212 Hz + Hz0 z y, 0, 0 .\n(3)\nBy substituting the magnetic vector potential, Eq. (3),\ninto the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (1b), we can readily observe that \u01240 is altered by deflecting the nanotube\nin the z-y plane. In this case, non-planar whirling displacement of the nanotube is due to the Laplace force\ngenerated by coupling between the magnetic field and\nthe Josephson current. As a consequence of the motion\nin the magnetic field, an electromotive force is induced\nalong the nanomechanical weak-link and its magnitude\ndepends on the rate of change of the nanowire profile in\nthe z-y plane, i.e., the rate of change of the magnetic flux\nthrough the circuit. In this description, now, the superconducting phase difference is not only a function of the\nbias voltage, but also of the nanowire deflection in the z-y\nplane. We decompose the nanotube motion in this plane\ninto two independent deflections y(x, t) = u0 (x)a(t) and\nz(x, t) = u0 (x)b(t), where u0 (x) is the normalized and\ndimensionless profile of the fundamental mode in both\ndirections. Then, following Shekhter et al. [26], a unitary\ntransformation which moves the vector potential from\nthe kinetic part of \u01240 to the phase difference between\nthe superconducting electrodes is applied. As a result,\nthe expression for the superconducting phase difference\nhas the form\n\u03c6(t) =\n\n\u0003\n\u03c6(t) 4eL \u0002\n+\nhz + h0z b(t) a(t) .\n2\n~\n\n(4)\n\nThe parameters hz = \u03b1Hz and h0z = \u03b2Hz0 are the renormalized magnetic field and magnetic field gradient in the\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Numerical simulations of Eqs. (6a) and (6b) for the time averaged coordinates Y and Z as function of\nthe driving voltage \u1e7c . The plots are calculated for \u03b3\u0303 = 0.001, \u03b5 = 0.012, \u03ba = 1 (L = 1 \u03bcm, hz = 40 mT, RT = 66 nm).\n\nz-direction calculated at the axis of the tube, respectively,\nwith \u03b1, \u03b2 \u223c 1 correctional factors originating from geometrical considerations.\nThe nanotube mechanics is thus described through the\nprojection amplitudes a(t) and b(t). For the conjugate\nvariables {a(t), pa (t)} and {b(t), pb (t)} (pj (t) denoting\nthe generalized momenta) one can formulate the following Hamiltonian function\nH(pa , pb , a, b, t) =\n\n\u0001 m\u03c9 2 2\n\u0001\n1\np2a + p2b +\na + b2 \u2212\n2m\n2\n\u2212 2D\u22060 cos(\u03c6(a, b, t)) , (5)\n\nwhere m and \u03c9 are the mass and the mechanical eigenfrequency of the nanoresonator, respectively. The last\nterm in Eq. (5) corresponds to the Josephson energy\nEJ (\u03c6(a, b, t)), with D the transmission coefficient of the\njunction. The equations of motion for a(t) and b(t)\nare then obtained from the Hamilton equations. Written in terms\nof \u000ethe dimensionless deflection\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u000ecoordinates\nY (t) = 4eLhz ~]a(t) and Z(t) = 4eLhz ~]b(t), the\nresulting set of differential equations for the nanotube\namplitudes is:\n\u0178 (\u03c4 ) + \u03b3\u0303 \u1e8e (\u03c4 ) + Y (\u03c4 ) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212 \u03b5 [1 + \u03baZ(\u03c4 )] sin \u1e7c t + [1 + \u03baZ(\u03c4 )] Y (\u03c4 ) , (6a)\n\nZ\u0308(\u03c4 ) + \u03b3\u0303 \u017b(\u03c4 ) + Z(\u03c4 ) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212 \u03b5\u03baY (\u03c4 ) sin \u1e7c t + [1 + \u03baZ(\u03c4 )] Y (\u03c4 ) . (6b)\nHere, we have added a dimensionless phenomenological\ndamping coefficient \u03b3\u0303 = [\u03b3/m\u03c9]. In these equations\n\u03b5 = [8eL2 h2z jc /m~\u03c9 2 ] with jc = [D\u22060 e/2~], the critical\ncurrent through the junction. We also set the timescale\nto \u03c4 = \u03c9t and, consequently, \u1e7c = [eV /~\u03c9]. The parameter\n\u03ba=\n\n~\n,\n4eLhz RT\n\n(7)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nwhere RT = hz /h0z denotes the curvature radius of the\nmagnetic cantilever tip, characterizes the degree of inhomogeneity of the magnetic field and will be referred to\nas the control parameter. It turns out that \u03ba determines\nthe dynamical behavior of the system. One can then realize the significance of \u03ba by considering fixed system\nparameters (L, hz ) and by letting the RT vary. In the\nlimit RT \u2192 \u221e, the control parameter vanishes and the\nequations of motion given by Eqs. (6) reduce to the case\ndiscused by Sonne et al. [23] where the magnetic field\nis uniform and, therefore, the amplitude of the driving\nforce acting in the z-direction becomes zero.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFor a qualitative and quantitative discussion of the dynamic behavior of the nanowire amplitudes, we consider\nthe following system parameters: a carbon nanotube of\nradius r = 1 nm and length L = 1 \u03bcm [27], superconducting order parameter \u22060 \u223c 10 meV, Josephson critical\ncurrent jc \u223c 100 nA [28], and quality factor Q \u223c 103 [29].\nWe also assume that \u03b3\u0303 = 1/Q, hz \u223c 40 mT, \u03b5 = 0.012,\nand RT is varied from 53 nm to 544 nm.\nNumerical simulations of Eqs. (6a) and (6b) allow us to\nstudy the time average of the nanotube deflection coordinates Y (t) and Z(t) as functions of the driving voltage\n\u1e7c . In doing so, one can notice that the system response\npresents a series of resonance peaks at integer values of\nthe driving voltage, i.e., the amplitude of the nanoresonator is not damped provided the resonant condition is\nfulfilled: the Josephson frequency matches the mechanical frequency (see Fig. 2). This resonant phenomenon\nwas first studied by Sonne et al. [23], who attributed a\ndirect resonance at \u1e7c = 1 and a parametric resonance at\n\u1e7c = 2. Accordingly, the same conclusion can be drawn\nfrom the results presented in Fig. 2. In the remainder of\nthe article we will be mainly focusing on the parametric\nregime and take \u1e7c = 2. In this case, the dynamic behavior of the amplitudes can be analized by postulating\na solution for both deflection coordinates in the form\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Numerical simulations for the stability analysis of Eqs.

(10)\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nHere, G(\u03ba) is the generatrix Hamiltonian function. The\nstudy proceeds by performing a stability analysis based\non Eqs. (9). In general, we shall study solutions of a system of coupled ODEs, dX/d\u03c4 = f (X, \u03ba), and solutions\nof a system of algebraic equations 0 = f (X, \u03ba).\nThe discussion commences by highlighting the symmetric nature of the stationary solutions for the algebraic\nsystem in Eqs. (9). For the above considered system parameters with RT = 544 nm and \u03ba = 0.12, numerical\nsimulations for the slowly-varying envelopes show that\nthe system presents several stationary points. Such qualitative behavior is visualized in the phase space diagrams\nfor the nanotube amplitudes, Y and Z, in Fig. 3. There,\n\nsolutions pictured by colored diamonds (\u2666) and black\ncrosses (\u00d7) correspond to stable and unstable stationary\npoints, respectively. Similarly, the phase portraits are divided in two regions, denoted I and II, by diagonal symmetry axes. The symmetry axes in the Y and Z coordinates satisfy the relations Ai \u2212 Ar = 0 and Bi + Br = 0,\nrespectively. From Fig. 3 it follows that the presented\npattern of solutions has a mirror-image symmetry with\nrespect to the line of symmetry that divides the phase\ndiagrams into regions I and II, where diamonds of the\nsame color represent the four components of a stable computed solution Xs and crosses in the same region (I or\nII) of both phase spaces account for the envelopes of an\nunstable solution Xu . From a symmetric point of view,\nthe system is characterized by two stable and two unstable (including X \u2261 0) stationary points in each region.\nHowever, the dimensionless angular momentum of the\nnanowire, Lx = Y dZ/d\u03c4 \u2212 ZdY /d\u03c4 , in both regions is\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\nContinuing our exploration, the computed results indicate that the bistable regime is only attained for \u03ba \u2264\n0.120. By letting the control parameter increase further,\nbistability is abandoned and the number of stationary solutions of Eqs. (9) is modified as well as their stability. In-\n\nTABLE I: Bifurcation pattern in the symmetric regions of\nsolutions I and II as a function of the control parameter \u03ba.\nSolution X \u2261 0 is included.\nNumber of\nNumber of\n\u03ba-interval\nstable solutions unstable solutions\n\u03ba \u2264 0.120\n2\n2\n0.120 < \u03ba \u2264 0.125\n3\n3\n0.125 < \u03ba \u2264 0.140\n1\n3\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 4: Period-doubling bifurcations for different values of the control parameter. Plots are shown for the first symmetry region\nof both phase spaces. Simulations were obtained for \u03b3\u0303 = 0.001, \u03b5 = 0.012 (L = 1 \u03bcm, hz = 40 mT).\n\ndeed, Table I presents the number of stable and unstable\nstationary solutions in the interval 0.120 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 0.140 in\nboth regions for these equations. As can be seen from the\ntable, the system displays a phenomenon called branching or bifurcation, which is a distinctive fingerprint of\nnonlinear dynamical systems [31]. The exhibited branching pattern formation can be described as follows. For\n\u03ba \u2264 0.120, bistability is accompanied by two unstable\nstationary points, one of them corresponds to X \u2261 0 (see\nFig. 3). Once the control parameter is slightly increased\nover the threshold value \u03ba = 0.120, the nonzero unstable\nstationary point becomes stable, and simultaneously, two\nnew unstable solutions appear and the system has now\nthree stable and three unstable (including the trivial solution) stationary points. Next, by varying the control\nparameter in the interval 0.120 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 0.125, the two\noriginal stable points and the two unstable ones move in\nphase space and approach each other. Finally, when the\ncontrol parameter ranges fom 0.125 to 0.140, the bistable\nand the created unstable solutions coalesce into two un-\n\nstable solutions. In this stage, there is only one stable\nand three unstable stationary points.\nIt turns out that for \u03ba > 0.140, the system leaves\nthe regime of equilibria and enters into the one of periodic solutions. In fact, at the critical control parameter\n\u03ba \u223c 0.150, there is an exchange of stability from the\nunique stable equilibrium to a stable limit cycle. This\ntransformation in phase space is performed through a\nPoincar\u00e9-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and the computed\nresults show that the stable limit cycle grows in phase\nspace for 0.150 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1. Hereupon, further changes in\nthe control parameter will be reflected in the periodicity of the limit cycle as it can clearly be seen in Fig. 4.\nIn this figure, the nanotube dynamics undergoes sucesive period-doubling cascade bifurcations in the amplitude modulation when varying \u03ba. Due to the symmetric\ncharacter of the solutions, the results are only plotted in\nregion I.\nPeriod-doubling bifurcations pave the way for chaotic\ndynamics [32] and for the control parameter \u03ba \u223c 1.25,\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Chaotic whirling motion of the suspended carbon nanotube. Red and blue dots represent the dynamical\nflowing of the system for initial conditions in the first and second region of symmetry, respectively. In this case, \u03b3\u0303 = 0.001,\n\u03b5 = 0.012 , \u03ba = 1.25 (L = 1 \u03bcm, hz = 40 mT, RT = 53 nm).\n\na particular event takes place. In Fig. 5 the phase portraits for the nanowire amplitudes suggest that the initially disconnected symmetric regions I and II are now\nconnected in a very complicated way. Furthermore, the\nflow diagrams for initial conditions in region I (red dots)\nand region II (blue dots) indicate that the system dynamically evolves in the two regions, i.e., the flow lines\ngenerated by Eqs. (9) are sensitive to the initial values\nand are dense in both regions, where two strange attractors can be readily identified. Hence, the system is in the\nchaotic regime.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have considered a voltage-biased nanoelectromechanical Josephson junction, where a suspended nanowire\nis serving as a weak link between two superconducting\nelectrodes, in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. For our\ncase study, we have assumed that the magnetic field is\ngenerated by an MFM cantilever tip and the nanowire\nis in the form of a metallic carbon nanotube. In such\na scenario, the inhomegeneity of the field in conjunction\nwith the Josephson current flowing through the tube, give\nrise to a Laplace force that induces the nanoresonator\nto perform a whirling movement. We have studied the\ntime evolution of the amplitude and relative phase of this\nnon-planar whirling motion and demonstrated that at the\nparametric resonance, their coupled dynamics exhibit a\nrich dynamical behavior characterized by: multistability,\nlimit cycles and chaos. These stationary regimes depend\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nH. Craighead, Science 290, 1532 (2000).\nM. L. Roukes, Sci. Am. 285, 42 (2001).\nM. L. Roukes, Phys. World 14, 25 (2001).\nA. N.

For instance, J.D. Pillet and collaborators designed and constructed a\nsuperconducting hybrid nanostructure that comprises a\ncarbon nanotube suspended between two superconductors [33]. Concerning the MFM cantilever tip, the experimental results reported by Victor N. Matveev and\nco-workers in Ref.

Due\nto a growing interest in complex behavior in nanodevices\n[35], the nonlinear and nonplanar phenomena exhibited\nby the system studied here have potential applications\nin signal processing, chaotic encryptation and random\nnumber generation [24, 25].\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author wishes to thank Leonid Y.
