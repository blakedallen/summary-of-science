Buyers\nNational Research Council, Chalk River Laboratories, Chalk River, Ont, K0J 1J0, Canada\n(Dated: November 15, 2018)\nLa4 Cu3 MoO12 is a cluster antiferromagnet where copper spin-1/2 form a network of strongly\ncoupled spin-trimers. The magnetic properties of this material have been examined using magnetic\nneutron scattering. At low temperatures, excitations from the ground state are observed at 7.5(3)\nmeV and 132.5(5) meV. An additional peak in the neutron scattering spectrum, which appears at\n125.0(5) meV on heating is ascribed to a transition between excited states. The wave-vector and\ntemperature-dependence of the inelastic magnetic scattering cross section is consistent with intratrimer transitions. Magnetic neutron diffraction reveals antiferromagnetic order below TN =2.6\nK that doubles the unit cell along the a direction. The ordered magnetic structure is described\nas inter-trimer order where spin correlations within trimers are controlled by the strong intratrimer interactions. Combining the information derived from elastic and inelastic magnetic neutron\nscattering with group theoretical analysis, a consistent set of intra-trimer interactions and ordered\nmagnetic structures are derived. The experiment provides a simple worked example of magnetism\nassociated with inter-atomic composite degrees of freedom in the extreme quantum limit.\nPACS numbers: 75.10.Jm, 75.25.+z\n\nGeometrically frustrated magnets are distinguished by\nan anomalous cooperative paramagnetic phase extending\nto temperatures well below characteristic microscopic energy scales.1 Fluctuations in this phase are strong and\nnon-trivial in that they satisfy certain local constraints.\nIn some cases, further cooling fails to produce a phase\ntransition and the low temperature state is quantum\ndisordered2,3 . In other cases, however, thermal or quantum fluctuations, magneto-elastic coupling, impurities,\nor sub-leading exchange interactions yield a finite value\nof hSi at sufficiently low temperatures4,5,6,7 .\n\nthan inter-trimer interactions. Magnetic susceptibility\ndata10,11 show two distinct linear regimes for 1/\u03c7(T ) versus temperature. For T > 400 K the Curie Weiss fit\nyields \u03bcef f =1.81 \u03bcB and \u0398W =\u2212558 K, which is consistent with strong intra-trimer interactions. For T < 250\nK the Curie constant decreases by a factor of 0.39 and\nthe Weiss constant decreases to \u221216 K. This indicates a\ncross over to a cooperative paramagnetic phase where\neach trimer represents a composite spin-1/2 degree of\nfreedom. The small Weiss temperature in this phase indicates weak AFM inter-trimer interactions. At lower\ntemperatures still, a maximum in \u03c7(T ) and a peak in the\nspecific heat indicates an antiferromagnetic phase transition at TN = 2.6 K.10\n\nTo advance the understanding of geometrically frustrated magnetism, we have explored spin correlations\nin La4 Cu3 MoO12 , a material which affords a spectacular example of geometrical frustration in the quantum\nlimit. La4 Cu3 MoO12 is a monoclinic ABO3 type cuprate\nwith space group P1121/m and B-cations in 1:3 ratio.11\nShown in Fig. 1, the Cu3 MoO4 layers of the material\nare built from Cu3 O triangular clusters, which we shall\ndenote trimers. Consideration of the crystal structure\nand the Goodenough rules9 indicate that intra-trimer\nexchange interactions are orders of magnitude stronger\n\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive neutron\nscattering study of La4 Cu3 MoO12 . Polarized and unpolarized inelastic neutron scattering data provide evidence\nfor magnetic excited states 7.5 meV and 132.5 meV above\nthe ground state. A calculation based on a simple intratrimer Hamiltonian is presented to explain the energy\nlevels, the wave vector dependence, and the temperature\ndependence of the inelastic neutron scattering cross section. Using elastic neutron diffraction we also show that\nLa4 Cu3 MoO12 has long range antiferromagnetic order at\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\f2\n\nJ3\n\n3\nJ2\n\nJ3'\n\n1\nJ1\n\n2\nJ1'\n\nJ2'\n\nb\na\n: Cu\n\n: Mo\n\n:O\n\nFIG. 1: Cu3 MoO4 plane of La4 Cu3 MoO12 . Actual coordinates for copper atoms are given in appendix A. The solid\nlines represent the triangle clusters. J1 , J2 and J3 are the intratriangle couplings; J\u2032 s are the weak intertriangle couplings\nthat are assumed to be antiferromagnetic and of similar magnitude as those in the mean field analysis of Wessel and Haas.8\nThe arrows illustrate one plane of the \u03c42 or \u03c43 magnetic structures with \u03c8 = 0 listed in table II.\n\nlow temperatures. While a unique ordered structure cannot be identified directly from the diffraction data, analysis based on ordering of composite spin-1/2 degrees of\nfreedom on neighboring trimers yields a consistent set of\nintra-trimer exchange interactions and inter-trimer spin\nconfigurations. The experiments and analysis provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of geometrically frustrated\nquantum magnetism in a simple model system with important analogies to more complex systems.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nA powder sample of La4 Cu3 MoO12 was synthesized using a previously published method.10 Rietveld analysis of\npowder neutron diffraction data confirmed a single phase\nsample with space group P1121/m and lattice parameters a = 7.9119(5) \u00c5, b = 6.8588(4) \u00c5, c = 10.9713(3) \u00c5,\nand \u03b3 = 90.008(9)\u25e6 at 10K. The elastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out on the BT2 thermal\nneutron triple-axis spectrometer at the NIST Center for\nNeutron Research. For that experiment we used a 30.2 g\npowder sample in a cylindrical container with a diameter\nof 1.6 cm. Pyrolytic Graphite (PG) crystals set for the\n(002) reflection were used to select 14.7 meV neutrons for\ndiffraction. There was a PG filter in the incident beam\n\nto suppress higher order contamination and collimations\nwere 60\u2032 \u2212 40\u2032 \u2212 40\u2032 \u2212 200\u2032 through the instrument from\nsource to detector.\nInelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on the HET direct geometry time-of-flight spectrometer at ISIS pulsed spallation neutron source. For\nthat experiment we used a 80.2 g powder sample in a\ncylindrical container with a diameter of 3.1 cm. We used\nthat instrument's \"sloppy\" chopper at frequencies of revolution 250 Hz and 400 Hz for incident energies of 40 meV\nand 160 meV respectively.\nPolarized inelastic neutron scattering measurements\nwere performed on the C5 triple-axis spectrometer at\nthe NRU reactor in Chalk River Laboratories in Canada.\nMagnetized Heusler crystals set for the polarizing (111)\nreflection were used as monochromator and analyzer with\nthe latter fixed to reflect 14.6 meV neutrons. A cold\nsapphire filter was placed before the monochromator to\neliminate high-energy neutrons. A PG filter was placed\nin the scattered beam to suppress order contamination\nat the analyzer. An energy dependent correction was applied to the incident monitor count rate to account for\nincident beam \u03bb/2 contamination. For this experiment\nwe used a 120 g powder sample in a cylindrical container\nwith a diameter of 2.5 cm. The collimation was 45\u2032 in\nthe incident and 80\u2032 in the scattered beam. A Mezei flipper was placed in the scattered beam. The flipping ratio\nmeasured at 14.6 meV on a powder reflection was 24:1.\nAbsolute normalization turned out to be crucial to\nderive information about the magnetic structure. We\nused nuclear Bragg scattering to normalize the magnetic\nBragg peak intensity.7 The inelastic neutron scattering\ndata was normalized by comparison to incoherent elastic count rates from a 20.14 g vanadium sample in the\nISIS experiment. A correction for neutron absorption in\nLa4 Cu3 MoO12 was applied in this latter case.\nA.\n\nElastic Neutron Scattering\n\nFig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic neutron diffraction at Q=0.397 \u00c5\u22121 . The data\nis evidence for an antiferromagnetic phase transition at\nTN =2.6 K \u226a \u0398W . The inset shows temperature difference data indicating that elastic scattering from the\nlow temperature spin structure is in the form of a welldefined Bragg peak. To within error the location of the\npeak is at 12 a\u2217 implying that the magnetic order doubles\nthe unit cell in the a direction. After due consideration\nof the finite instrumental resolution (solid bar in the inset), we derive a lower limit of 100 \u00c5 for the magnetic\ncorrelation length.\n\nB.\n\nInelastic Neutron Scattering\n\nFig. 3 shows the energy dependence of the scattering\ncross section at various temperatures. Because of the\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Temperature dependence of the ( 12 00) magnetic\nBragg peak intensity. The inset shows the wave vector dependence of the difference between elastic magnetic neutron\nscattering at T = 0.4 K and T = 10 K. The energy resolution\nwas 1.3 meV and the wave vector resolution is indicated by\nthe solid line in the inset.\n\nwide dynamic range, we show only the interesting magnetic parts of the spectrum, low energies on the left and\nhigher energies on the right. The right panels clearly\nshow an excitation at 132.5 meV. As temperature increases, the peak intensity at 132.5 meV decreases and\na second peak emerges at h\u0304\u03c9=125 meV. A likely explanation for the lower energy peak is that it corresponds\nto a transition to the 132.5 meV state from an excited\nstate at 132.5 meV-125 meV=7.5 meV, which is populated on heating. To explore this scenario, the left panels\nfocus on the energy range around 7.5 meV. As is apparent from the increase of intensity with temperature,\nthere is significant phonon scattering in the lower energy\nrange and this complicates the task of isolating the magnetic contribution to the scattering cross section. Since\nphonon scattering increases with temperature12 while low\nenergy magnetic scattering generally decreases with temperature, we used high temperature data (T = 200 K)\nwhere magnetic scattering is negligible to determine the\nphonon density of states. At each temperature, the appropriate thermal factor was then applied to yield the\nphonon contribution to inelastic neutron scattering. The\ntriangles in the left panels of Fig. 3 show the background\nsubtracted data that indicate a residual peak in the excitation spectrum, which we tentatively associate with\nmagnetic scattering.\nTo unambiguously verify the existence of a magnetic\nexcitation at 7.5 meV, a polarized neutron scattering\nmeasurement was carried out at T=6 K and at a momentum transfer of 1.5 \u00c5\u22121 . Only magnetic scattering\ncan produce a difference between spin flip scattering with\nguide fields at the sample position parallel and perpendicular to wave vector transfer.13 Such difference data\nis shown as closed triangles in Fig. 3(a) and they provide immutable evidence for a magnetic excitation at 8(1)\nmeV. Also shown is the sum of spin flip and non-spin-flip\n\nFIG. 3: h\u0304\u03c9-dependence of the normalized Q-averaged neu \u0303\ntron scattering intensity I(Q,h\u0304\u03c9)\nat various temeratures and\nin two different energy ranges. The open circles are raw experimental data. The open triangles are the phonon background subtracted data in (a)\u2013(c), and the excess scattering\nabove that at 10 K for (e)\u2013(f). The closed circles and closed\ntriangles in (a) are total scattering and magnetic scattering\nintensities respectively from the polarized neutron measurement. A single scale factor was applied to the polarized data\nfor best agreement with the unpolarized time of flight data.\n\nscattering as solid circles. Twice the count rate with the\nanalyzer turned through 4 degrees was subtracted from\nthe summed data and a single overall scale factor was\napplied to all the polarized data to facilitate comparison\nto the time of flight data (open circles). The excellent\nagreement between the two independent determinations\nof the magnetic contribution to inelastic scattering at 7.5\nmeV provides strong evidence for an intra-trimer excited\nstate at this energy.\nFrom gaussian fits to all inelastic data, we derived\nthe temperature dependence of the integrated intensities, peak positions and peak widths that are reported\nin Fig. 4. For peak widths, the calculated energy resolution was subtracted in quadrature to produce values\nfor the intrinsic half width at half maximum relaxation\nrate, \u0393 or inter-trimer bandwidth. The energy levels are\ntemperature independent to within error as expected for\nintra-trimer excitations. \u0393 is of order the low-T CurieWeiss temperature, which is consistent with inter-trimer\ninteractions being the main source of intra-trimer level\nbroadening. Transitions involving the excited state doublet appear to have a greater relaxation rate than those\ninvolving other levels. Possible reasons for this include\nmagneto-elastic effects and enhanced inter-trimer coupling for trimers occupying the 7.5 meV excited state.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: Wave-vector dependence of energy integrated intensity for the 132.5 meV (circles) and the 7.5 meV excitations\n(triangles) in La4 Cu3 MoO12 .

Lines in frame\n(a) were calculated from the trimer model.\n\nFig. 5 shows the wave-vector dependence of the energy\nintegrated intensity for the 7.5 meV and the 132.5 meV\nmodes. Kinematical limitations prevented measurement\nof the high energy excitations over a significant range of\nwave-vector transfer and at lower energies admixture of\nphonon scattering complicates the analysis. Still there is\nevidence that the intensity of the 7.5 meV mode decreases\nin rough correspondence with the magnetic form factor\nfor copper, which indicates that this excitation involves\na very small cluster of copper atoms. In addition we\nshall see that the relative intensity of the two modes is\nconsistent with a simple trimer exchange Hamiltonian.\n\nIII.\n\nANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nA.\n\nEnergy Level Scheme\n\nFrom the energy level scheme we can extract detailed information about intra-trimer exchange interactions. The highest energy state for a spin-1/2 trimer\nwith antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions is a quartet with total spin 3/2. If the interactions within the\n\ntrimer have the symmetry of an equilateral triangle there\nis a fourfold degenerate ground state composed of two\ndegenerate Kramers doublets. For lower symmetry the\ndegeneracy is lifted and there are two low energy doublets. While they approximate the symmetry of isosceles\ntriangles, the spin-1/2 trimers in La4 Cu3 MoO12 have no\nexact symmetry elements. In Appendix B, we calculate\nthe energy levels and scattering cross sections for a general spin-1/2 trimer with a model Hamiltonian of the\nform\nH = J1 S 1 * S 2 + J 2 S 2 * S 3 + J 3 S 3 * S 1 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe p splitting\nbetween\nthe\ndoublets\nis\nE01 = J12 + J22 + J32 \u2212 J1 J2 \u2212 J2 J3 \u2212 J3 J1 and the\nsplitting between the ground state doublet and the quartet is E02 = 21 (J1 + J2 + J3 + E01 ). These energies can be\nassociated respectively with the 7.5 meV and the 132.5\nmeV transitions observed by inelastic neutron scattering.\nFrom this we can derive the average intra-trimer exchange constant to be J \u0304 = (2E02 \u2212 E01 )/3 = 85.8 meV.\nThe splitting between doublets yields information about\nthe ratios between intra-trimer exchange constants. Ratios that are consistent with the 7.5 meV doublet-doublet\ntransition lie on an ellipse in the J1 /J3 versus J2 /J3 plot\nshown in Fig. 6. The ellipse is centered at the equilateral\npoint (1,1) and the major axis lies along the isosceles\nJ1 = J2 line. The half major axis is approximately\np\n2 /(2E 2 \u2212 2E E ) = 0.124 and the half minor\n9E01\n01 p02\n02\n2 /(2E 2 \u2212 2E E ) = 0.071.\naxis is approximately 3E01\n01 02\n02\nIn the following, we shall label intra-trimer interaction\nparameters that are consistent with the spectroscopic\ninformation by the counter-clockwise azimuthal angle,\n\u03c8, on this ellipse with \u03c8 = 0 corresponding to J1 = J2\nand \u03c8 = n\u03c0 describing isosceles triangles.\nWessel and Hass8 recently studied the phase diagram\nfor La4 Cu3 MoO12 using a model Hamiltonian including\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: The basis functions for irreducible representations\nof space group P1121 /m with magnetic wave vector ( 21 00) and\nfor atoms on the 2e site.

The excitation energies observed in\nthe present experiment imply that the ratios of exchange constants lie on the ellipse shown in the center of the figure. The\nobservation of ( 21 00) magnetic order also helps to constrain\npossible values of the exchange constants.\n\nthe nearest neighbor interactions within the a-b plane\ndefined in Fig. 1. This study shows that different ratios\nof intra-trimer interactions yield different in-plane wave\nvectors for long range order. The wave vectors predicted\nin the limit of vanishing inter-trimer interactions at T = 0\nare indicated on Fig. 6. Given that TN \u226a J \u0304 this is\nthe appropriate limit to consider. Taking into account\nthis T = 0 phase diagram leads to the conclusion that\nthe azimuthal angle specifying intra-trimer interaction\nasymmetry must satisfy \u03c8 = \u03c0 or \u2212\u03c0/4 < \u03c8 < \u03c0/4.\nIn Fig. 5 the wave vector dependence of the energy\nintegrated intensities at T = 10 K are compared to the\nformulae of Eq. (B6) and Eq. (B7). The agreement between model and data is quite satisfactory considering\nthat there are no adjustable parameters. While the comparison does not provide information on intra-trimer exchange, it supports the identification of a magnetic contribution to inelastic scattering at 7.5 meV, as the absolute cross section inferred from polarized and unpolarized\nmagnetic neutron scattering is in perfect agreement with\nthat predicted for the transition between the two doublets of the spin-trimer.\nThe temperature dependence of the integrated intensities for the three inelastic peaks follows from Eq. (B6) to\nEq. (B8). It depends only on the population of the intratrimer levels, which in turn only depends on E01 and\nE02 . The solid and dashed lines in Fig. 4 (a) were calculated from these formulae using the experimental values\nfor E01 and E02 and they are found to be in excellent\nagreement with the data.\n\n\u03c44\n\n1\n001\n000\n000\n100\n010\n000\n000\n000\n000\n100\n010\n000\n000\n000\n000\n001\n000\n000\n\nB.\n\n2\n000\n001\n000\n000\n000\n100\n010\n000\n000\n000\n000\n100\n010\n000\n000\n000\n001\n000\n\nposition (2e)\n3\n4\n000\n001\u0304\n000\n000\n001\n000\n000\n100\n000\n010\n000\n000\n000\n000\n100\n000\n010\n000\n000\n1\u030400\n000\n01\u03040\n000\n000\n000\n000\n100\n000\n010\n000\n000\n001\n000\n000\n001\n000\n\n5\n000\n001\u0304\n000\n000\n000\n100\n010\n000\n000\n000\n000\n1\u030400\n01\u03040\n000\n000\n000\n001\n000\n\n6\n000\n000\n001\u0304\n000\n000\n000\n000\n100\n010\n000\n000\n000\n000\n1\u030400\n01\u03040\n000\n000\n001\n\nMagnetic Structure\n\nOnly the ( 12 00) magnetic Bragg peak could be detected\nin the present experiment. We obtained the absolute\nmagnetic structure factor at ( 12 00) by comparison to the\n(230) nuclear Bragg peak. By combining this information with the symmetry analysis described in Appendix\nA, and the spectroscopic information presented in section III A, we can associate each of a few possible ordered structures with a specific set of intra-trimer exchange constants.\nThe symmetry analysis is based on the assumption\nthat any magnetic structure adopted through a second\norder phase transition can be expanded in basis functions for a single irreducible representation of the magnetic space group. Table I lists the basis functions for four\nof the irreducible representations of magnetically ordered\nLa4 Cu3 MoO12 . \u03c41 and \u03c44 describe uniaxial spin configurations with spins oriented along the c direction while \u03c42\nand \u03c43 correspond to co-planar structures with spins in\nthe a \u2212 b plane.\nTo make the connection between spectroscopy and\nmagnetic structure we consider the ordered structure not\nas ordering of individual spins, but as ordering of the\ncomposite spin-1/2 degree of freedom associated with the\nlowest energy intra-trimer doublet.

The seven spin structures and values of\nexchange constants that are consistent with this assumptions are listed in table II. Of these, the three structures\nwith \u03c8 = 0 seem more likely because as opposed to the\n\u03c8 = \u03c0 structures, they have a finite range of stability in\nthe J1 /J3 \u2212 J2 /J3 plane (see Fig. 6).\n\n\f7\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary we have presented neutron scattering data\nthat provide detailed microscopic information about frustrated quantum magnetism in La4 Cu3 MoO12 . Neutron spectroscopy yields the average intra-trimer exchange constant of 85.8 meV and narrows possible intratrimer exchange ratios to an elliptical trajectory in the\nJ1 /J3 \u2212 J2 /J3 plane. Neutron diffraction provides evidence for low temperature inter-trimer magnetic order\nthat doubles the unit cell along the a direction. The\n( 21 00) magnetic Bragg peak intensity and the approximate isosceles nature of the spin triangles narrows the\npossible exchange constants to J1 = J2 = 88.2 meV and\nJ3 = 81.1 meV or J1 = J2 = 83.2 meV and J3 = 91.1\nmeV. A previously published mean field analysis of magnetic order in La4 Cu3 MoO12 indicates that the former\ncombination of exchange constants is most likely. The\ncorresponding ordered spin structures are uniaxial with\ntwo parallel spins at the base of the isosceles triangle\n(hSz i = 31 ) and an antiferromagnetically correlated spin\nof half the magnitude at the apex. The data are consistent with a spin direction either along b or c. Another\nunresolved issue is the magnetic stacking sequence along\nc for which there are two options for spins oriented along\nb.\nThere is an instructive analogy between the frustrated cluster antiferromagnetism in La4 Cu3 MoO12 and\nrare earth magnets. In materials with Kramers rare\nearth ions, intra-atomic correlations establish effective\nspin-1/2 degrees of freedom, which subsequently develop\nlong range magnetic order due to inter-atomic exchange\ninteractions.14 Magnetic neutron scattering from such a\nsystem carries the rare earth atomic form factor.12 Magnetism in La4 Cu3 MoO12 is also based on a composite\nspin-1/2 degree of freedom, only it is spread over three\natoms, it is established by inter-atomic exchange interactions, and it carries an oscillatory trimer \"form factor\".\nLa4 Cu3 MoO12 is thus a particularly simple example of a\nconcept of increasing importance in quantum magnetism.\nEnd states and holes in Haldane spin chains,15,16 , impurity spins in high temperature superconductors,17 and\nspontaneously formed or structurally defined spin clusters in frustrated magnets.18,19 All are strongly correlated systems where suitably defined multi-atom composite spin degrees of freedom provide an enormous simplification for understanding low energy spin dynamics\nand the corresponding thermodynamic properties.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWork at JHU was supported by the NSF through\nDMR-0074571.\n\nAPPENDIX A: SYMMETRY ANALYSIS OF\nMAGNETIC ORDERING\n\nA magnetic structure with a wave vector K can be\nexpanded in basis functions of a single irreducible representations of the space group of the crystal with wave\nvector K:\nX\nSK\u03bd\n(A1)\nC\u03bb\u03bd S0 (K\u03bd\n0j =\n\u03bb |j) ,\n\u03bb\n\nwhere SK\u03bd\n0j describes the spin vector of the jth magnetic\nion in the 0th cell which determines the magnetic structure of the crystal with a wave vector K, and S0 (K\u03bd\n\u03bb |j)\nis the basis function transforming according to the \u03bdth\nirreducible representation.

For the\nirreducible representations \u03c41 and \u03c43 , the spins on sites\n4-6 are antiparallel to those on sites 1-3, while they are\nparallel for the irreducible representations \u03c42 and \u03c44 .\n\n\u03b4 (h\u0304\u03c9 + E(S) \u2212 E(S \u2032 )) ,\nwhere\n\u0013 \u2032\n\u03b3e2\nk 2\nF (Q)exp [\u22122W (Q)] ,\nme c2 k\n\u0015\n\u0014\nE(S)\n.\n\u03c1(S) = Z \u22121 exp \u2212\nkB T\nC0 = N\n\n\u0012\n\n(B2)\n\n\f9\nAlso, Q = k \u2212 k\u2032 is the scattering wave vector, F (Q) is\nthe magnetic form factor,22 and Z is the partition function.
