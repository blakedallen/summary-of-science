J. Jaynes' observation that entropy increase in Gibbs\nmixing is only due to the including more observables measuring the entropy. To further show up the subtle role\nof the quantum mechanism in the GP, we study the different finite size effect on the entropy change and shows\nthe works performed in the mixing process are different for various types of particle.\nPACS numbers: 05.70.Ln, 05.30.-d, 03.65.Ta, 03.67.-a\n\nIntroduction\u2013 More than one century ago, J.Willard Gibbs\n[1] pointed out that, if the entropy were not extensive due to\nthe neglection of indistinguishability of particles, there would\nbe an entropy increase after two ideal gases from two containers at thermal equilibrium are mixed. On the contrary, the\ninverse process would bring the system back to its original\nstate and cause the entropy decrease for the closed system.\nThis apparently violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics(SLT). However, for distinguisable particles, this inverse\nprocess would not bring the system to the original inital state,\nand not violate the SLT.\nIn many textbooks, e.g., the Ref.[2], the GP is claimed to be\nsolved by considering the indistinguishability of particle in the\nview of quantum theory, and adding correction to the expression of entropy. This mixing process will bring no entropy\nchange for identical particles, while additional increase for\nnon-identical ones. However, this pedagogic explanation includes neither the internal properties of particle nor a quantum\npeculiarity of the problem (e.g., non-commutativity). On this\naspect, we still do not understand how the entropy changes\ndisappear only when two gases are the same, even though they\ncan be arbitrary similar. In the classical thermodynamic, it\nis always able to assumed the substances empirically distinguished, however without defining how small their difference\nis. Thus, it is expected the perfect resolution of the GP should\nbe referred to the quantum mechanics with intrinsic consideration of indistinguishability, even with internal variables of\nparticles. This point was considered by some authors [3, 4]\nby introducing the internal state phenomenologically, and the\ndiscontinues of entropy change is avoided by utilizing another\nthermodynamic quantity- work.\nAnother resolution was based on the recognition that the\nknowledge of difference in particle types serves as information, which enables extracting more work to compensate the\nentropy increase [5]. However how the internal state involve\nin the mixing process is still unknown. On this sense, a fully\nconsistent quantum description of the GP, to our best knowledge, is still lack, especially on the indistinguishability of the\n\nparticles based on the standard quantum theory, such as the\nsecond quantization approach with symmetrizing wave functions. Fortunately, the quantum thermodynamics (QT) [6\u20138]\nhas enlighten solutions to some paradoxes in thermodynamics [9, 11], e,g, the Maxwell's demon (MD) paradox [10\u201312]\nwith quantum Szilard engine. The QT may only concern the\nfew-particle system, which sometimes is efficient to reveal the\nunderlying principles and intrinsic mechanism.\nIn this letter, we give a fully quantum solution to the GP\ninvolving the symmetrization of wave function of identical\nparticles. We consider the mixing process of two particles\nconfined in a infinite square potential well, which is divided\ninto two sub-cells by a solid wall. Using the exact expression of the density matrix, we demonstrate explicitly that the\ninitial un-mixing systems in the conventional presentation of\nGP are not in thermal equilibrium with respect to the whole\nwell. For the identical particles, we follow the standard approach of second quantization and correctly write down the\nthermal equilibrium state of an un-mixing whole system by\nincluding internal variables and symmetrizing wave-function.\nThis doing surprisingly restores the original version of GP\nfor both non- and identical particles (Boltzman particles, and\nbosons/fermions) and solves the GP by showing the same entropy changes. The detailed comparisons with the case ignoring internal state is made to explicitly explain the origin of the\nparadox. For the cases with more particles, we also demonstrate almost the same result except for a little difference between boson and fermion, due to the finite size effect.\nGibbs paradox with infinite potential well- In thermal equilibrium, the the most probable state of many particles in a\ncontainers with two sub-cells of equal volume usually is the\nsituation with each cell containing the equal number of particles. Thus, to show up the essence of the GP, we firstly consider the two particle case, similar to the single molecule case\n[13] for the Szilard heat engine in resolving the MD paradox.\nLet us model the whole container as an infinite high square\npotential well V (x, l) (= 0 for x \u2208 (0, l) and \u221e otherwhere) to trap two particles (see Fig.1(a) ). The well is\n\n\f2\n|ri. Let the blue and red particles be trapped respectively in\nthe left and right sub-cells with the Hamiltonian\nH = p2 /2M +|bi hb| V (x, l/2)+|ri hr| V (x\u2212l/2, l/2), (2)\n0\n\nl/2\n(a)\n\nl\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1.

With the explicit expressions of eigen-wavefuctions given in the Supplementary\nL\nR\nMaterials (SM), \u03c6L\nn (x) = hx \u03c6n and \u03c6n (x) are supported\nover the whole domain (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) including (0, l). This observation seems trivial, however can serves as the key point to\nresolve the GP as well as the MD paradox [11, 12] .\nTo show this, we write down the thermal equilibrium state\n\u03c1T =\n\nXX 1\nuv\nuv\ne\u2212\u03b2Enm |\u03a6uv\nnm i h\u03a6nm | ,\nZ\nT\nn,m u,v\n\n(1)\n\nof two Boltzman particles with inverse temperature \u03b2 and partition function ZT . It includes not only the terms with \u03a6RL\nnm\nand \u03a6LR\nnm for two particles in the different sub-cells shown\nLL\nin Fig. 1(a), but also the terms with \u03a6RR\nnm and \u03a6nm for\ntwo particles in the same sub-cells. If the later terms were\nignored as in the conventional description of GP, the initial\nun-mixing state used here would not be in thermal equilibrium, and thus could not correctly address the very problem\nin GP correctly. For non-identical particles, we can actually\nassert that one specified atom in the right sub-cell and another\nin the left. As emphasized by Jaynes, the specified assertion\nto distinguishable particles actually reduces the system's entropy. Such difference between non- and identical particles is\nthe very root of the GP. Based on this observation, we solve\nthe GP by introducing internal state to the identical particles\nto restore the original GP in the next section.\nQuantum description \u2013 In order to resolve the GP, we would\nmake the situation with equal number of particles in the both\nsub-cells be the thermal state by referring certain prior information. It is possible for non-identical particles since they\ncould be subject to different potentials. With the similar\nmethod, we can prepare the initial thermal state for identical particles with internal variable. Using the \"colors\" to label\nthe internal degenerate states, the blue |bi and the red ones\n\nwhere the potential is shown in Fig.1(b). And we assume that\nthe internal state of the two identical particle are different. Obviously, this assumption assigns one bit information, which\nbrings the identical particle with the same initial un-mixing\nstate as non-identical one. Therefore, the Gibbs mixing could\ncauses entropy increase for both non- and identical particles.\nThe single particle eigen-wavefunctions of the present sysL\nR\nR\ntem are b\u03c6L\nn \u2261 |bi\u2297 \u03c6n and r\u03c6n \u2261 |ri\u2297 \u03c6n with corL\nR\nresponding eigen-energy En and En . Associating with their\nquantum statistics properties, the two-particle wavefunctions\nbefore the Gibbs mixing are symmetrized or anti-symmetrized\nas\nE\n1\nR\nR\nL\nU \u2212B(F )\n\u03a8nm\n= \u221a ( b\u03c6L\nn 1 r\u03c6m 2 \u00b1 r\u03c6m 1 b\u03c6n 2 ) (3)\n2\nU \u2212B(F )\n\nR\n.\n= EnL + Em\nwith the same eigen-energy Enm\nHere, the sign plus/minus corresponds the boson/fermion\ncase.

After the mixing process, two particles\nare constrained in the larger domain (0 < x < l). The singleparticle wavefunctions of this system then become |\u03c6sn i \u2261\n|s, \u03c6n (x, l)i (degenerate for s = b, r,) with the same eigen2\nenergy En = n2 \u03c0 2 ~2 /2M lE\n.

The entropy change in the mixing process is simply\u0002calculated by using von\nentropy as \u2206SB(F\u0003) =\n\u0003 Neuman\n\u0002\nTr \u03c1U \u2212B(F ) ln \u03c1M \u2212B(F ) \u2212 Tr \u03c1M \u2212B(F ) ln \u03c1M \u2212B(F ) .\nWe notice that the calculations about entropy change concern only the eigen-energies, rather than the concrete form of\nthe wavefunction. However, the symmetry type of the wavefucntion determines the counts of states to the partition function. For two non-identical particles with un-symmetrized\n\u2212N\nR\neigen-wavefunctions \u03a8U\n= b\u03c6L\nnm\nn 1 \u2297 r\u03c6m 2 , the correU \u2212N\nR\nsponding eigen- energy simply is Enm\n= EnL + Em\n.

Therefore, it is concluded that the entropy changes in the process of\nmixing two bosonic, Fermionic and non-identical particle are\nthe same, namely\n\u2206SB = \u2206SF = \u2206SN .\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\n\n1.6 (b)\n1.2\n2ln2\n0.8\n0.4\n0.0\n-0.2\n(d)\n12\n1\n8\n4\n0\n0\n-1\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0.0\n\nFermi\nBose\nNormal\n\nW\n\n\u2206\n\nS\n\n1.6 (a)\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0.0\n-0.2\n(c)\n2\n\nl\n\n0.1\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 2.

With this observation, we\nconclude that the GP is rooted in the initial difference of unmixing state rather than the character of indistinguishability\nof particles. It is also noticeable that we only utilize the quantum definition of entropy, the von Neuman entropy, other than\nany phenomenological presentations.\nMixing entropy and work of two particle systems \u2013 As for\nthe quantum effect in our approach for GP, the finite size of\nthe well induces many interesting phenomenon. To explicitly\ndemonstrate the effect, we take the bosonic case for\nPexam2\nple. In terms of the Theta function \u03b83 (0, q) = 1 + 2 n q n ,\nthe partition functions before and after the Gibbs mixing are\n2\nexpressed[14] as ZU \u2212B = [\u03b83 (0, q) \u2212 1] /4 and ZM \u2212B =\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b83 0, q 1/4 \u2212 1 /4\n\u0001 respectively with the parameters q =\n2 2\n2\nexp \u22122\u03b2\u03c0 ~ /ml . The straightforward calculation explicitly gives the entropy increase during the mixing process\nas\n\n\u2206SB = 2 (\u03b2\u2202\u03b2 \u2212 1) ln\nOn this sense, GP is resolved.\nIt is also meaningful to compare the present results with\nthat without considering the internal state for Bosonic and\nFermionic particles. In our consideration, the initial unmixing state is a thermal state with all the three situations\nin Eq.(1). The mixing process is completed by removing the\n0\ncentral potential isothermally.\nThe entropy\u0003 change \u2206SX\nand\n\u0002\n0\n0\n0\nwork WX = kB T ln ZU \u2212X \u2212 ln ZM \u2212X are calculated by\nusing the partition functions of un-mixing and mixed parti0\ncles ZU0 \u2212X and ZM\n\u2212X with X = B, F, N . Here, we deal\nwith the usual setup in the conversional presentation of GP\nfor non-identical atoms, which is the same as that with internal state. We refer the detailed analysis for different species\nto Supplement Materials. One prominent feature is that both\nentropy changes and work done for different species are different, while these are the same in the process above with the\ncorrect considerations about internal state. We show these differences in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a-b), the entropy changes of\nidentical particle approaches zero, while that of non-identical\nparticles is 2 ln 2. The discrepancy just recovers the discontinuousness of entropy changes in conventional presentation\nof GP. The similar difference in work extraction is illustrated\nin Fig.2(c-d). In the present model, no internal freedom is\nprobed and no prior information is added for identical particles. In comparison with the previous presentation of GP\nwith internal freedom, we can conclude that the discontinuousness is caused by the different start-point between identical\nand non-identical particles.\nTo understand the above result, we recall the conventional\npresentation of GP that the initial state of the identical particles is formally different from the non-identical ones, which\nresults in no entropy change for mixing identical particles.\nTo our understanding, the same entropy changes are restored,\n\n\u03b83 (0, q) \u2212 1\n\u0001\n.\n\u03b83 0, q 1/4 \u2212 1\n\n(5)\n\nUsing\nthe\nduality\nof\nthe\nTheta-fucntion\n\u0001\u0001\n1/2\n(\u2212 ln q/\u03c0) \u03b83 (0, q)\n=\n\u03b83 0, exp \u03c0 2 / ln q ,we\np\nprove that \u03b83 (0, q) \u2192 1/ \u2212 ln q/\u03c0 in the high temperature limit T \u2192 \u221e or in the classical limit L \u2192 \u221e.\nWith this observation, the classical result is recovered as\nlimL\u2192\u221e \u2206SB = 2 ln 2 = \u2206Sclassical .\nVery quantum nature is the dependence of entropy change\non size of the trap and also on the temperature, illustrated\nin Fig. 3(a). The entropy change \u2206Sclassical in the classical case is marked as gray-dashed line in Fig. 3(a-b). The\nentropy changes tends to the classical one \u2206Sclassical as the\ntrap size approaches infinite, presented in Fig. 3(a). This confirms our theoretical analysis given above. We also show its\ndependence on the inverse temperature \u03b2 in Fig. 3 (b). The\nentropy also tends to the classical case as the inverse temperature approaches zero(\u03b2 \u2192 0), since the thermal fluctuation\ncompares well the discreteness of the energy levels in the well.\nFinally, starting with the correct uses of the eigen-vectors and\n-energies, we consider work done in the mixing process as\nthe references[4, 5]. The mixing process is performed isothermally, and the work just compensates the free energy change,\nnamely, WB = kB T [ln ZU \u2212B \u2212 ln ZM \u2212B ], which is the\nsame for different species. This seemingly-trivial observation\nalso solves GP. We show in Fig. 3(c-d) the work done as function of trap size l and inverse temperature \u03b2 respectively. With\nlarger trap size, the work approaches zero. However, it is not\nzero as temperature increase. Similar behavior has also been\nobserved in the insertion\n\u221a process of SHE[11]. Theoretically,\nthe work diverges as T as T \u2192 \u221e. The detailed derivation\nis presented in Supplement Materials.\nMixing entropy of 4 particle systems\u2013 To give prominence\nto the properties of quantum statistics, we consider the mixing process of four particles.

For Z1 (q) = [\u03b83 (0, q) \u2212 1] /2,\nthere exist two limit results: in the quantum limit with\nlow temperature \u03b2/l2 \u2192 \u221e, we have Z1 (q) \u223c 2q;\nand p\nin the classical limit \u03b2/l2 \u2192 0, we have Z1 (q) \u223c\n1/2 \u2212 ln q/\u03c0\u22121/2.

Indeed, when deviating from the classical limit or the\nlower temperature, the entropy change obviously displays the\nobvious differences between boson and fermion.\nIf we mix identical particles without considering\nthe internal state, one must start from an equilibrium\n0\nstate with partition function[14] ZU \u2212B(F ) (N = 4) =\nPN\n0\nB(F )\nB(F )\n(q)Z4\u2212n (q), and that ZM \u2212B(F ) (N = 4) =\nn=0 Zn\nB(F )\n\nZ4\n(q 1/4 ) after mixing. In the classical limit, we obtain\n0\nthe entropy change as liml\u2192\u221e \u2206SB(F ) (N = 4) = 0.\nThe results obtained here can be directly generated for the\narbitrary atom number N .\n\nSummary\u2013We have resolved the Gibbs paradox in a fully\nquantum framework with the correct presentations of the initial thermal states of the working substances consisting of the\nparticles with different quantum statistical properties. Here,\nwe utilize a standard quantum description, the wave function\nsymmetrization from the second quantization of the particles\nwith internal variable. The key point is our finding that the\nproblem in the paradox are rooted in the different uses ( somehow misuses) of the initial thermal state for identical and nonidentical particles. We use examples with two and four particles to illustrate our comprehensive understanding for GP. We\nshow that the entropy change of identical and non-identical\nparticles are the same for two particle system, but the deference could only be found as the finite size effect in the low\ntemperature, or in the cases with more than two particles.\n\n[1] W.J.

Mixing process of 2 atoms\n(i) With internal Freedom\nThe Hamiltonian for the atoms with internal freedom is written as\nH = |bi hb| \u2297 Hb + |ri hr| \u2297 Hr ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Hi = p2 /2m + Vi (i = b, r) is the corresponding Hamiltonian of the atom with internal state i = b, r. For this model, the\nmixing is done by moving the right boundary of the left potential to the right (x = l) and the left boundary of the right potential\nto the left (x = 0).

The explicit expression of Z2\n(q) is\nB(F )\n\nZ2\n\n(q) =\n\n\u0011\n\u00012\n1\u0010\nZ1 (q 4 ) \u00b1 Z1 (q 8 ) .\n2\n\n(23)\n\nThe concrete form of the un-mixing gas is rewritten as\n\u00112\n\u00012\n1\u0010\nZ1 (q 4 ) \u00b1 Z1 (q 8 )\n4\n!2\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b83 (0, q 4 ) \u2212 1\n1\n\u03b83 (0, q 8 ) \u2212 1\n=\n.\n\u00b1\n4\n2\n2\n\nZU \u2212B(F ) (N = 4) =\n\n(24)\n\nAfter mixing, these four atoms are confined in a infinity high square well with width l. The partition function is simply\n\u0010\n\u00112\nB(F ) 1/4\nZM \u2212B(F ) (N = 4) = Z2\n(q )\n\u00112\n1\u0010\n2\n(Z1 (q)) \u00b1 Z1 (q 2 )\n=\n4\n!2\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n\u03b83 (0, q) \u2212 1\n\u03b83 (0, q 2 ) \u2212 1\n=\n\u00b1\n.\n4\n2\n2\n\n(25)\n\nTherefore the entropy change is\n\u2206SB(F ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u2202\u03b2 ) ln\n\nZM \u2212B(F ) (N = 4)\n.\nZU \u2212B(F ) (N = 4)\n\n(26)\n\nUsing the property of Theta function, it is not difficult to show that under the classical limit (T \u2192 \u221e or l \u2192 \u221e ), the entropy\nchange tends to be 4 ln 2 for both Boson and Fermion systems.\n(ii) Without internal freedom\nIn this section, we discuss the mixing process which is the same as the one in the last section except that the atoms considered\nhere do not contain internal freedom. In this circumstance, the initial state is a mixing of 5 situations, i.e., the n-th situation is\nthat there are n atoms in the left compartment while the others are in the right compartment. Thus, the initial partition function\nis\nZU0 \u2212B(F ) (N = 4) =\n\n4\nX\n\nZnB(F ) (q)Z4\u2212n (q),\n\n(27)\n\nn=0\nB(F )\n\nwhere Zn\n(q) denotes the connonical partition function of a n-particle system confined in a square protential well with width\nB(F )\nl/2. The relationship between Zn\n(q) and Z1 (q) can be found in Tab.(I) .\n\n\f8\nAfter the mixing process, the system becoms to be a well containing four identity atoms and the partition function is\n!\n2 2\n4\n1\nZ\n(q)\n+\n3Z\n(q\n)\n\u00b1\n6Z\n(q\n)\n1\n1\n1\n.\nZU0 \u2212B(F ) (N = 4) = Z4 (q 1/4 ) =\n24 \u00b16Z1 (q 2 )Z1 (q)2 + 8Z1 (q 3 )Z1 (q)\n\n(28)\n\nThis partion function can also be related to the Theta function by the ways mentioned above. The entropy change during this\nprocess is\n0\n\n\u2206SB(F ) (N = 4) = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u2202\u03b2 ) ln\n0\n\n0\nZM\n\u2212B(F ) (N = 4)\n\nZU0 \u2212B(F ) (N = 4)\n\n,\n\nwhich can also be proved that limL\u2192\u221e \u2206SB(F ) (N = 4) = 0 by using the property of the Theta function.\n\n\f"}
