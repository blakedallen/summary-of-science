At least some of the super-massive objects\nin galactic nuclei are too heavy and compact to be clusters of non-luminous bodies, since the\ncluster lifetime due to evaporation and physical collisions would be shorter than the age of\nthe system [5]. All these objects are commonly interpreted as black holes (BHs), since they\ncannot be explained otherwise without introducing new physics. However, there is no direct\nobservation evidence that they have an event horizon [6], while there are theoretical arguments suggesting that the final product of the gravitational collapse may be quite different\nfrom a classical BH [7\u201312].\nIn 4-dimensional general relativity, BHs are described by the Kerr solution and are\ncompletely specified by two parameters: the mass, M , and the spin angular momentum, J.\nInstead of J, one can use the specific spin angular momentum a = J/M , or the dimensionless\nspin parameter a\u2217 = J/M 2 . The fact that these objects have only two degrees of freedom is\nknown as \"no-hair\" theorem [13\u201315] and implies that all the mass moments, Ml , and all the\ncurrent moments, Sl , of the space-time can be written in term of M and J by the following\nsimple formula [16, 17]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nJ l\nMl + iSl = M i\n.\nM\n\n(1.1)\n\nAs it was put forward by Ryan in [18, 19], by measuring the mass, the spin, and at least one\nmore non-trivial moment of the gravitational field of a BH candidate, one over-constrains\nthe theory and can test the Kerr BH hypothesis.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fThe possibility of testing the Kerr metric around astrophysical BH candidates with\nfuture experiments is quite extensively discussed in the recent literature. A constraint on the\nnature of these objects has been recently obtained by considering the mean radiative efficiency\nof AGN [20]. The detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral of a stellar-mass compact\nbody into a super-massive object, the so-called extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), can be\nused to put very interesting constraints [21\u201327]. Since the future gravitational wave detector\nLISA will be able to observe about 104 \u2212 106 gravitational wave cycles emitted by an EMRI\nwhile the stellar-mass body is in the strong field region of the super-massive object, the\nquadrupole moment of the latter will be measured with a precision at the level of 10\u22122 \u2212\n10\u22124 [23]. The metric around super-massive BH candidates can also be probed by observing\ntheir \"shadow\" [28\u201330]. Additional proposals to test the Kerr BH hypothesis involve the\npossible discovery of a stellar-mass BH candidate with a radio pulsar as companion [31], the\nstudy of the K\u03b1 iron lines [32], and the analysis of the X-ray spectrum of a geometrically\nthin and optically thick accretion disk [33].\nA fundamental limit for a BH in general relativity is the Kerr bound |a\u2217 | \u2264 1. This is\njust the condition for the existence of the event horizon. The accretion process can spin a\nBH up to a\u2217 \u2248 0.998 [34] and many super-massive objects in galactic nuclei may be rapidly\nrotating BHs with spin parameter close to this limit [35\u201337]. Nevertheless, if these objects\nare not the BH predicted by general relativity, the Kerr bound does not hold. Interestingly,\nin this case the accretion process can easily spin them up to a\u2217 > 1 [38]. Such a possibility\nis currently ignored in the literature. It is also neglected in those works in which it is not\nassumed that these objects are BHs and it is studied how future observations can test the\nKerr metric. For experiments like LISA, that rely on matched filtering, this may be a serious\nproblem.\nIn Ref. [39\u201342], I studied some features of the accretion process onto objects with |a\u2217 | >\n1. However, an important question to address is if objects with |a\u2217 | > 1 can really form.\nIn [38], I showed that deviations from the Kerr metric can have the accreting gas spin the\nbody up to a\u2217 > 1. I used the Manko\u2013Novikov (MN) metric [43], which is a stationary,\naxisymmetric, and asymptotically flat exact solution of the vacuum Einstein's equation. It\ndescribes the exterior gravitational field of a rotating massive body with arbitrary mass\nmultipole moments and has an infinite number of free parameters. However, it has the\ndrawback that it is valid only for sub-extreme objects, with spin parameter |a\u2217 | < 1. So, I\nshowed that the equilibrium spin parameter aeq\n\u2217 must be larger than 1, but it was impossible\nto discuss the accretion process for a\u2217 > 1, compute aeq\n\u2217 , and figure out the properties of\nthe space-time when a\u2217 > 1. An extension to include super-spinning objects, if it exists, is\nnon-trivial. In the present paper, I overcome this problem by considering another metric,\nthe Manko\u2013Mielke\u2013Sanabria-G\u00f3mez (MMS) solution [44, 45]. It is not as general as the MN\nmetric, but it can be easily extended to discuss objects with a\u2217 > 1.\nThe content of this paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, I present the MMS solution adapted to\nthe case of super-spinning objects. In Sec. 3, I study the main properties of this space-time\nand I show that the evolution of the spin parameter for an object whose exterior gravitational\nfield is described by the MMS metric can be calculated as in the case of a BH. In Sec. 4, I\ndiscuss the evolution of the spin parameter of an object with non-Kerr quadrupole moment,\nas a consequence of the accretion process. Sec. 5 is devoted to the discussion of the results\npresented in Sec. 4, while summary and conclusions are in Sec. 6. Throughout the paper I\nuse units in which GN = c = 1.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f2\n\nExterior field of a rotating body with non-Kerr quadrupole moment\n\nThe Manko\u2013Mielke\u2013Sanabria-G\u00f3mez (MMS) metric [44, 45] is a stationary, axisymmetric,\nreflection-symmetric, and asymptotically flat exact solution of the Einstein\u2013Maxwell equations. It includes, as special cases, the Kerr and the \u03b4 = 2 Tomimatsu\u2013Sato solutions. It\nis specified by five real parameters: the mass, M , the specific spin angular momentum,\na = J/M , the electric charge, Q, and two other parameters, b and \u03bc. The latter of which\ndetermine the mass quadrupole moment, Q, and the magnetic dipole moment, M. Since\nthe MMS solution is reflection-symmetric, all the odd mass moments and the even current\nmoments are identically zero. Here I am interested in the vacuum solution only, and I put\nQ = M = 0, which implies \u03bc = 0. The mass quadrupole moment of the gravitational field is\nQ = QKerr \u2212 (d \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 ab)M ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere QKerr = \u2212a2 M is the quadrupole moment of a BH and\n\u03b4=\u2212\n\nM 2 b2\n,\nM 2 \u2212 (a \u2212 b)2\n\nd=\n\nM 2 \u2212 (a \u2212 b)2\n.\n4\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn Refs. [44, 45], the metric is written in prolate spheroidal coordinates, which are suitable for slow-rotating objects. It can be adapted to fast-rotating objects by proceeding as for\nthe \u03b4 = 2 Tomimatsu\u2013Sato metric [46]: one has to change the prolate spheroidal coordinates\ninto oblate spheroidal coordinates. That can be achieved through the transformation:\nx \u2192 ix ,\n\nk \u2192 \u2212ik ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit, i.e. i2 = \u22121.

In this paper, I will use the following definition of anomalous\nquadrupole moment q\u0303\nQ = \u2212(1 + q\u0303)a2 M .\n\n(2.8)\n\nFor q\u0303 = 0, one finds Q = QKerr , while for q\u0303 > 0 (q\u0303 < 0) the object is more oblate (prolate)\nthan a BH. Eq. (2.8) is what we expect for neutron stars, with q\u0303 \u2248 1 \u2212 10, depending on\nthe equation of state and the mass of the body [47]. It is reasonable to assume that q\u0303 \u2265 \u22121,\nsince otherwise the effect of the rotation would make the body more and more prolate. For\ngiven M and a, the MMS solution does not allow for any arbitrary value of the anomalous\nquadrupole moment. In Fig. 1, I show q\u0303 = (d \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 ab)/a2 as a function of b for a\u2217 = 0.4\n(left panel) and a\u2217 = 1.4 (right panel). There are three distinct curves: one in the region\nb < a \u2212 M (curve A), one in the region a \u2212 M < b < a + M (curve B), and the last one\nfor b > a + M (curve C). The equation q\u0303 = (d \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 ab)/a2 may have no real solutions for\nb (when |a\u2217 | < 1), and up to four distinct real solutions (for q\u0303 sufficiently small). The Kerr\nmetric is recovered for b2 = a2 \u2212 M 2 . Two or more distinct solutions with the same M , a,\nand q\u0303 correspond to objects with the same mass, spin, and quadrupole moment, but with\ndifferent higher order moments. A particular solution requires prolate spheroidal coordinates\nif d + \u03b4 > 0 and oblate spheroidal coordinates if d + \u03b4 < 0; otherwise, the constant k becomes\nan imaginary number. Generally speaking, slow-rotating solutions require prolate spheroidal\ncoordinates, while fast-rotating solutions need oblate spheroidal coordinates; however, the\ncritical value acrit\nseparating the two cases depends on q\u0303 and can be either larger or smaller\n\u2217\nthan 1. In the rest of the paper, I will study the evolution of the spin parameter of objects\nwith q\u0303 \u2265 \u22121 and therefore I will discuss the solutions of b belonging to the curve A and B.\nWhen I find two solution with the same quadrupole moment, I will call the solution with\nsmaller |b|, MMS1, and the other, MMS2.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nProperties of the MMS solution\nStructure of the space-time\n\nThe structure of the MMS space-time reminds one of the Tomimatsu\u2013Sato and MN solutions [24, 48]. One finds naked singularities and closed time-like curves very close to the\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fmassive object. The idea is that all these pathological features do not exist because inside\nthe compact object, where the MMS metric, which is a vacuum solution, does not hold.\nMoreover, for |a\u2217 | < aeq\n\u2217 these pathological regions are always inside the inner radius of the\ndisk and therefore they do not play any role in the discussion of the accretion process.\nThe infinite redshift surface gtt = 0 determines the boundary of the ergoregion, which\nis not a pathological region and exists even around a rotating BH. Figs. 2, 3, and 4 show the\nergosphere (red solid curve) for some MMS solutions with different value of the spin parameter\nand of the anomalous quadrupole moment. I use quasi-cylindrical coordinates \u03c1z, see App. A.\nThe topology of the ergoregion can change significantly as a\u2217 and q\u0303 vary. The same figures\nshow also the boundary of the closed time-like curve regions (blue dotted curves), defined\nby g\u03c6\u03c6 = 0. For small deviations from the Kerr metric (Fig. 2, q\u0303 = 0.01), the shape of the\nergoregion is very similar to the Kerr case, see App. B, but there are one or two small holes,\nwhere gtt < 0. Every hole of the ergoregion can be associated with a small region with closed\ntime-like curves, even if the boundaries of the holes and of the closed time-like curve regions\ndo not coincide. For q\u0303 = 1.0 (Fig. 3), there are two disconnected ergoregions1 with no holes\nand one closed time-like curve region. For q\u0303 = \u22121.0 (Fig. 4), one finds two ergoregions and one\nclosed time-like curve region for the MMS1 solutions (left panels) and one ergoregion with a\nhole and two distinct closed time-like curve regions for the MMS2 solutions (right panels). Let\nus notice that the MMS1 solutions with (a\u2217 , q\u0303) = {(0.98, 0.01), (0.8, 1.0), (1.2, 1.0)} require\nprolate spheroidal coordinates, while all the other cases need oblate spheroidal coordinates.\nAs the spin parameter increases, ergoregions and closed time-like curve regions move to larger\n\u03c1, but this is just an artifact of the coordinate system, see App. A.\n3.2\n\nGeodesic motion\n\nThe MMS space-time is stationary and axisymmetric. There are thus two constants of motion\nassociated respectively with the t- and \u03c6-coordinate; that is, the specific energy E and the\nspecific axial component of the angular momentum L:\nE = \u2212gtt \u1e6b \u2212 gt\u03c6 \u03c6\u0307 ,\n\nL = gt\u03c6 \u1e6b + g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03c6\u0307 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere the dot denotes the derivative with respect an affine parameter. From (3.1), we have\n\u1e6b =\n\nEg\u03c6\u03c6 + Lgt\u03c6\n,\n2 \u2212g g\ngt\u03c6\ntt \u03c6\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\u0307 = \u2212\n\nEgt\u03c6 + Lgtt\n.\n2 \u2212g g\ngt\u03c6\ntt \u03c6\u03c6\n\n(3.2)\n\nBy substituting \u1e6b and \u03c6\u0307 into the equation of the conservation of the rest mass, g\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = \u22121,\nwe find\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne2\u03b3\n\u1e8b2\n\u1e8f 2\ne2\u03b3 2\n+\n=\n(\u03c1\u0307 + \u017c 2 ) = Veff (\u03c1, z, E, L)\n(3.3)\nf\nx2 + 1 1 \u2212 y 2\nf\nwhere\nVeff =\n\nE2\nf\n\u2212 2 (L \u2212 \u03c9E)2 \u2212 1 .\nf\n\u03c1\n\n1\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe fact that there are two disconnected ergoregions may depend on the coordinate\u221asystem, as in prolate\nspheroidal coordinates the Schwarzschild radius r = M reduces to the segment |\u03c1| < a2 \u2212 M 2 and z = 0\nand the region with r < M is not included, see App. A. The existence of these ergoregions should also be\ntaken with caution, because close to the pathological region with closed time-like curves.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fSince the left-hand side of Eq. (3.3) is non-negative, the motion of a test-particle is restricted\nto the region Veff \u2265 0. The zeros of the effective potential Veff are shown in Figs. 5 and 6\n(orange dashed-dotted curves) for a\u2217 = 1.2, q\u0303 = 1.0 (MMS1), and different values of E and\nL. They indicate the boundary of the allowed regions of the motion. The blue dotted curves\ndenote the boundaries of the closed time-like curve regions and must be inside the object.\nIn Fig. 5, top panels, oblate spheroidal coordinates xy are used. The bottom panels are\nenlargements of the region close to the compact object in quasi-cylindrical coordinates \u03c1z.\nFor E = 1 and large L (right panels in Fig. 5), we find an unbound region extending\nto infinity and a plunging region close to the massive object. As L decreases, the unbound\nregion moves closer to the plunging region and a new allowed region of motion appears\n(central panels of Fig. 5). The latter has no counterpart in the Kerr space-time, while it\nexists in the MN case [24]. For smaller L (left panels of Fig. 5), the unbound region merges\nwith the plunging one.\nFor E < 1, the situation is similar. In general, one find a bound region and a plunging\nregion (central panel of Fig. 6). As L decreases, the bound region approaches the plunging\nregion and eventually merges with the latter (left panel of Fig. 6). On the other hand, for\nlarger values of L there is the plunging region only (right panel of Fig. 6).\nIn conclusion, the behavior of the geodesic motion is not very different from the Kerr\nand MN space-times. In particular, one can expect that the standard picture of the accretion\nprocess is correct: the particles of the gas approach the compact objects by losing energy\nand angular momentum. When they are at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), they\nquickly plunge to the object2 .\nIn addition to E, L, and the rest mass, in the Kerr space-time there is a fourth constant\nof motion, the Carter constant C [49]. Its existence allows for the full separability of the\nequations of motion and it is a major source of research in modern day EMRI modeling. For\na generic space-time, the existence of an effective fourth constant of motion can be checked\nby studying the Poincar\u00e9 maps for geodesic motion of bound orbits: if they are all closed\ncurves, there is a fourth constant of motion [24]. In analogy with the case of the MN solution\ndiscussed in [24], presumably even in the MMS space-time all orbits are strictly speaking\nchaotic, and no true fourth integral exists, but most of the orbits appear to be regular and\none can find a quantity that is nearly invariant along them.\n\n4\n\nEvolution of the spin parameter\n\nIn this section, I compute the evolution of the spin parameter of the compact object due\nto the accretion process from a thin disk following Ref. [50]. I assume that the disk is\non the equatorial plane of the object3 and that the disk's gas moves on nearly geodesic\ncircular orbits. The gas falls to the central object by loosing energy and angular momentum.\n2\n\nThis picture is surely correct for q\u0303 \u2265 0, as the radius of the ISCO is always determined by the orbital\nstability along the radial direction. For q\u0303 < 0, the radius of the ISCO may depend on the stability of the\norbit along the vertical direction, see e.g. the discussion in Refs. [33, 38]. In this second case, the gas particles\nreach the ISCO and then leave the equatorial plane. They plunge to the compact object after having lost\nadditional energy and angular momentum. Such an additional loss of energy and angular momentum seems\nto be negligible in the description of the accretion process, but that should be checked in future studies by\nperforming hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations.\n3\nThis assumption is correct for long term accretion onto a super-massive object at the center of a galaxy,\nsince the alignment timescale of the spin of the object with the disk is typically much shorter than the accretion\ntimescale [38].\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fFigure 2.

The solid red curves denote the infinite redshift surface\ngtt = 0, defining the boundary of the ergoregion of the space-time.

If the gas is \"absorbed\" by the\ncompact object, with no further emission of radiation, the compact object changes its mass\nby \u03b4M = EISCO \u03b4m and its spin angular momentum by \u03b4J = LISCO \u03b4m, where EISCO and\nLISCO are respectively the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of the gas\nparticle at the ISCO, while \u03b4m is the gas rest-mass. The evolution of the spin parameter\nturns out to be governed by the following equation [50]\n1 LISCO\nda\u2217\n=\n\u2212 2a\u2217 .\nd ln M\nM EISCO\n\n(4.1)\n\nIn the case of a body with a solid surface made of ordinary matter (i.e. protons, neutrons,\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fFigure 4.

L, \u03c1, and z are\ngiven in units of M = 1.\n\nand electrons), this picture is not rigorously correct: the gas particles hit the surface of the\nbody and release their gravitational energy in form of radiation. They are also accumulated\non the surface and may undergo nuclear reactions, with the production of bursts. In such a\nsituation, the computation of the evolution of the spin parameter is much more complicated\nand model dependent. On the contrary, if the compact object is a BH, the gas particles are\nreally absorbed without further emission of radiation, since the BH has no solid surface, and,\nonce the particles are behind the event horizon, their radiation cannot escape to infinity.

(4.1) and obtain [50]\n\"\n#\nr\nr\n\u221a\n2 M0\nM02\n4 \u2212 18 2 \u2212 2\nfor M \u2264 6M0 ,\na\u2217 =\n3M\nM\n\u221a\na\u2217 = 1 for M > 6M0 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\neq\nassuming an initially non-rotating BH with mass\n\u221a M0 . The equilibrium is reached for a\u2217 = 1\nafter the BH has increased its mass by a factor 6 \u2248 2.4. Including the effect of the radiation\nemitted by the disk and captured by the BH, one finds aeq\n\u2217 \u2248 0.998 [34], because radiation with\nangular momentum opposite to the BH spin has larger capture cross section. The presence\nof magnetic fields in the plunging region may further reduce this value to aeq\n\u2217 \u223c 0.95 [51, 52],\nby transporting angular momentum outward.\nFor astrophysical BH candidates, we can presumably use Eq. (4.1). They indeed seems\nto be capable of absorbing the accreting gas without apparent loss of energy and angular\nmomentum: no electromagnetic emission from their surface is observed, see e.g. Refs. [53\u2013\n55]. For a generic stationary and axisymmetric space-time, EISCO and LISCO can be computed\nnumerically, as described in [33]. Here I assume that q\u0303 is a constant and does not change as\nthe object increases its mass and is spun up, but this is not true in general. For example,\nin the case of neutron stars, q\u0303 depends on the mass of the body [47]. If the astrophysical\nBH candidates were objects with an anomalous quadrupole moment depending strongly on\nthe mass of the body, objects with different mass could have a different equilibrium spin\nparameter.\nNeglecting the effect of the radiation captured by the object and the presence of magnetic\nfields in the plunging region, in Fig. 7 I show da\u2217 /d ln M as a function of the spin parameter\na\u2217 for some values of the anomalous quadrupole moment q\u0303. The value of the equilibrium\nspin parameter aeq\n\u2217 for these cases is reported in Tab. 1. In Fig. 7, the solid red curve is for\na BH (q\u0303 = 0) and has been computed by using Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates. Indeed, even if\nthe Kerr metric is included in the MMS solution, neither the form of the metric presented\nin [44, 45], nor the one discussed in Sec. 2 are suitable for numerical calculations, as they\nwould require that the parameter b is an imaginary number. For a similar reason, for a\ngiven q\u0303 6= 0 we cannot study the evolution of the spin parameter from a\u2217 = 0 to a\u2217 = aeq\n\u2217 ,\nbut from some value ain\n>\n0,\ndepending\non\nq\u0303.\nWhen\nda\n/d\nln\nM\n>\n0,\nthe\naccretion\nprocess\n\u2217\n\u2217\nspins the compact body up.

These two cases have anyway to be taken with caution:\nthere are regions with closed time-like curves with Schwarzschild radius larger than M , so\neven the surface of the compact object should be probably larger than M . Let us notice,\nhowever, that this happens for a\u2217 > aeq\n\u2217 and it can be neglected in the study of the evolution\nof the spin. As shown in Fig. 10, for sufficiently high values of the spin parameter, the inner\nradius of the disk always increases as a\u2217 increases. This is not a surprise, because even in\nthe Kerr space-time the radius of the ISCO reaches a minimum for a\u2217 \u2248 1.089, and then it\nincreases as a\u2217 increases [56].\nThe value of the inner radius of the disk depends inevitably on the choice of the coordinates; the comparison of this quantity for objects with different value of q\u0303 is thus not\nso meaningful. From this point of view, a more interesting quantity is the angular velocity\nof a gas particle at the inner radius of the disk, which is shown in Fig. 11. As we can see,\nthe angular frequency at rin can be very high around a very fast-rotating BH, while it is\nsignificantly lower for another compact object, regardless of its spin parameter. This can be\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fan interesting observational feature to test the Kerr nature of astrophysical BH candidates,\nbecause it implies that it is very difficult for an object that is not a BH to mimic a very\nfast-rotating BH. In other words, among the stationary and axisymmetric space-times, the\nKerr solution is a very special case with peculiar properties and this is particularly true for\na\u2217 \u2192 1. Generally speaking, the accretion process onto an object with non-Kerr quadrupole\nmoment looks more like the accretion onto a slow-rotating BH, but it can hardly present\nsome features of a fast-rotating BH.\nFor fast-rotating objects, even deformations beyond the quadrupole moments are important for the properties of the space-time. In Fig. 12, I show the inner radius of the disk\nand the corresponding angular frequency of a gas particle around objects with a\u2217 = 0.99 as\na function of the anomalous quadrupole moment. The three curves represent three objects\nwith same mass, spin, and quadrupole moment, but different higher order moments: the\nsubclass of MN solutions discussed in [38], the MMS1 solution, and the MMS2 solution.\nAs already noticed in [38], Eq. (4.1) provides the correct evolution of the spin parameter\nif the compact object does not become unstable before reaching the equilibrium value aeq\n\u2217 .\nMore in general, the accretion process can spin the body up, but there may exist other\nprocesses that spin it down. This is what should happen, for instance, in the case of a\nneutron star: the gas of the accretion disk can spin the neutron star up, but, when the\nrotational frequency of the object exceeds \u223c 1 kHz, there are unstable modes that spin the\nneutron star down through the emission of gravitational waves [57]. If something similar\nhappens for BH candidates, the maximum value of the spin parameter would be determined\nby the internal structure of these objects. The latter may spin down by emitting gravitational\nwaves, presumably as a burst, potentially detectable by future experiments.\nThe fact that the accretion process can spin a compact object up to a\u2217 > 1 can be\nrelevant for the super-massive BH candidates at the center of galaxies, while it should be\nnegligible for stellar-mass objects in X-ray binary systems. In general, the value of the spin\nparameter of a compact object is determined by the competition of three physical processes:\nthe event creating the object, mergers, and gas accretion. For the stellar-mass BH candidates in X-ray binary systems, the value of their spin should reflect the one at the time of\ntheir creation. If they belong to low-mass X-ray binary systems, even swallowing the whole\nstellar companion they cannot change significantly their spin, because the mass of the stellar\ncompanion is much smaller. If they are in high-mass X-ray binary systems, even accreting at\nthe Eddington limit they do not have enough time to grow before the explosion of the companion. On the contrary, for the super-massive objects in galactic nuclei the initial spin value\nis completely unimportant, as they have increased their mass by a few orders of magnitude\nfrom the original one. In the case of prolonged disk accretion, the object has the time to align\nitself with the disk and the process of gas accretion should dominate over mergers [36]. This\npicture is supported even by current estimates of the mean radiative efficiency of AGN [37].\nAs shown in [38], the alignment timescale is the same for BHs and objects with non-Kerr\nquadrupole moment, as long as |q\u0303| \u001c 100.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe final product of the gravitational collapse of matter is thought to be a black hole and\nthere are astrophysical evidences for the existence of dark objects that are too compact and\ntoo heavy to be relativistic stars or clusters of non-luminous bodies. In 4-dimensional general\nrelativity, a black hole is completely specified by its mass M and by its spin parameter a\u2217 ,\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\nrin\n\n6\n\nrin\n\n6\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\na*\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n1.6\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\na*\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n1in\n\n1in\n\nFigure 10.

The accretion process can spin a black hole up to a\u2217 \u2248 0.998 and at least\nsome of the super-massive objects at the center of galaxies may be fast-rotating black holes\nwith spin parameter close to this value.\nThe Kerr black hole paradigm is still based on a set of unproven assumptions. They\nsounded reasonable forty years ago, but they are more questionable today. There is no direct evidence that black hole candidates have an event horizon, while there are theoretical\narguments suggesting new physics appearing at macroscopic scales [7\u201312]. If the astrophysical black hole candidates are not the objects predicted by general relativity, they are not\nsubjected to the Kerr bound. Interestingly, the accretion process onto a body with non-Kerr\nquadrupole moment typically spins the object up to a\u2217 > 1.\nIn Ref. [38], I used the Manko\u2013Novikov solution to describe the exterior gravitational\nfield of a generic compact body. I showed that in most cases the equilibrium spin parameter is\nlarger than 1. However, the Manko\u2013Novikov solution is valid only for |a\u2217 | < 1 and therefore\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fMN\n0.5 MMS1\nMMS2\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n0.3\n\nrin\n\n1in\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0.2\n2\nMN\n1 MMS1\nMMS2\n0\n-3\n-2\n\n0.1\n\n-1\n\n0\n~\nq\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n3\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n~\nq\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 12.

In the present paper, I considered the\nManko\u2013Mielke\u2013Sanabria-G\u00f3mez solution, which can describe the gravitational field outside\na compact body with non-Kerr quadrupole moment and spin parameter either smaller and\nlarger than 1. I studied the basic properties of the space-times when a\u2217 > 1, I discussed the\nevolution of the spin parameter, and I found its equilibrium value, see Figs. 7, 9, and Tab. 1.\nFor fast-rotating objects, the accretion processes onto a black hole and onto a generic body\nare quite different. For example, only around a black hole can the inner radius of the disk be\nvery small, while the angular frequency of the gas particles at the innermost circular orbit\ncan be significantly higher than the one around another object.\nThe fact that the accretion process in a non-Kerr background can spin the compact body\nup to a\u2217 > 1 is relevant for the research devoted to figure out how future observations can\ntest the Kerr nature of the current astrophysical black hole candidates. The possibility that\nthese objects can have spin parameter larger than 1 cannot be ignored and this is particularly\ntrue for experiments like LISA, whose detection relies on matched filtering.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Enrico Barausse, Shinji Mukohyama, and Naoki Yoshida for useful\ndiscussions.

The inverse relation is\nx=\n\nR+ + R\u2212\n,\n2k\n\ny=\n\nR+ \u2212 R\u2212\n,\n2k\n\n(A.3)\n\np\nwhere R\u00b1 = \u03c12 + (z \u00b1 k)2 . Through the formal transformation x \u2192 ix and k \u2192 \u2212ik,\nwhere i is the imaginary unit, one changes the prolate spheroidal coordinates into oblate\nspheroidal coordinates. The relation between the quasi-cylindrical coordinates and the oblate\nspheroidal coordinates is therefore given by\np\n\u03c1 = k (x2 + 1)(1 \u2212 y 2 ) , z = kxy .\n(A.4)\nLastly, the relation between quasi-cylindrical coordinates and Schwarzschild coordinates\nis [58]\np\n\u03c1 = r2 \u2212 2M r + a2 sin \u03b8 , z = (M \u2212 r) cos \u03b8 ,\n(A.5)\nwhere M is the mass and a = J/M the specific spin angular momentum.\nProlate spheroidal coordinates are suitable for describing the space-time around slowrotating objects, while oblate spheroidal coordinates are suitable in the case of fast-rotating\nobjects. In the special case of the Kerr space-time, prolate spheroidal coordinates can be used\nonly for BHs, oblate spheroidal coordinates only for Kerr naked singularity (see App. B). The\nleft (right) panel of Fig. 13 shows some curves with constant prolate (oblate) coordinate x on\nthe \u03c1z-plane for k = 1.5 M . Fig. 14 shows instead some curves with constant Schwarzschild\nradial coordinate, still on the \u03c1z-plane, for a = 0.8 M (left panel) and a = 1.2 M (right panel).\nIn the former case, the quasi-cylindrical\ncoordinates cover the space with Schwarzschild\n\u221a\n2 and the surface with radial coordinate r = r\nradial coordinate r \u2265 rH = M + M 2 \u2212 a\u221a\nH\ncorresponds to the segment \u03c1 = 0 and |z| < M 2 \u2212 a2 . Here rH is equal to the Schwarzschild\nradial coordinate of the even horizon of a Kerr BH with spin a. When |a| > M , the quasicylindrical coordinates can be used to describe the region r > M (otherwise there is not a\none-to-one correspondence between the\n\u221a two coordinate systems) and the circle with radius\nr = M reduces to the segment |\u03c1| < a2 \u2212 M 2 and z = 0 on the \u03c1z-plane. For non-Kerr\nobjects, prolate (oblate) spheroidal coordinates are still adequate only for slow-rotating (fastrotating) objects, but in general the value of the spin a separating the two cases is not M\nany more.\n\nB\n\nKerr space-time in spheroidal coordinates\n\nIn prolate spheroidal coordinates, the line element (A.1) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\nk 2 e2\u03b3 2\ndx2\ndy 2\n2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212f (dt \u2212 \u03c9d\u03c6) +\nx \u2212y\n+\n+\nf\nx2 \u2212 1 1 \u2212 y 2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nk2 2\n+\nx \u2212 1 1 \u2212 y 2 d\u03c62 .\nf\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n(B.1)\n\n\fx = 1.0\nx = 1.5\nx = 2.0\nx = 3.0\nx = 4.0\n\n6\n4\n\n4\n2\n\n0\n\nz\n\nz\n\n2\n\nx = 0.0\nx = 1.0\nx = 2.0\nx = 3.0\nx = 4.0\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-6\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nl\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nl\n\nFigure 13.
