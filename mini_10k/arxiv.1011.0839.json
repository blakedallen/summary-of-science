Lattice calculations indicate that the crossover region between hadron and quark-gluon matter has been\nreached in these experiments. On the other hand, lattice calculations performed in gluodynamics (GD) clearly\ndemonstrate the occurrence of there occurs the first-order\nphase transition.\nThe shear \u03b7 and bulk \u03b6 viscosities are parameters that\nquantify dissipative processes in the hydrodynamic evolution of a fluid. It is known that the behavior of transport\ncoefficients is sensitive to the presence of phase transitions in a medium (see [5\u201311] and references therein).\nValues of the bulk and shear viscosities near the phasetransition critical temperature Tc affect the hydrodynamic evolution of the medium and may influence observables.\nLattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the most\npowerful technique to extract nonperturbative information on an equation of state (EoS). When experimental\ndata are lacking, lattice data are often used to fit model\nparameters. For pure gluon SU(3) theory, the EoS was\ncomputed on the lattice more than a decade ago [12]. Recently, much more accurate data have been obtained [13].\nAmong various existing phenomenological approaches,\nquasiparticle (QP) models are used to reproduce results\nobtained in the lattice QCD. In the case of GD, the QP\nmodels rely on the assumption that for the temperature\nT above the critical one, T > Tc , the system consists\nof a gas of massive deconfined gluons. In the confined\nphase, at T < Tc , the glue matter is considered as a gas\nof massive glueballs.\nIn this paper we aim to investigate the behavior of\nviscosity coefficients for a gluon system that exhibits a\ndeconfinement phase transition. The phenomenological\n\nQP model is applied to describe available lattice data on\nthe EoS. Shear and bulk viscosities are calculated within\na relaxation-time approximation.\n\nII.\n\nEQUATION OF STATE OF GLUE MATTER\n\nIn the QP approach the system of interacting gluons\nis treated as a gas of noninteracting quasiparticles with\nan effective mass mg (T ), which depends on T as [4]\nm2g (T ) =\n\nNc 2\ng (T ) T 2\n6\n\n(1)\n\nwith the temperature-dependent strong interaction constant\ng 2 (T ) =\n\n48\u03c0 2\n,\n11Nc ln [\u03bb(T \u2212 Ts )/Tc )]2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere parameters Ts /Tc =0.5853, \u03bb =3.3 are taken to fit\nthe new lattice data, see below, and a number of colors\nNc =3. The energy density and the pressure acquire then\nthe following forms:\n\u03b5g (T ) =\n\ndg\n2\u03c0 2\n\n\u2261\n\nPg (T ) =\n\ndg\n6\u03c0 2\n\nR\u221e\n\nE\np2 dp exp(E/T\n)\u22121 + B(T )\n0\nid\n\u03b5g (T, mg (T )) + B(T ),\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2261\n\n0\n\n2\n\np2 dp pE\n\n1\nexp(E/T )\u22121\n\nPgid (T, mg (T ))\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212 B(T )\n\n\u2212 B(T ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the degeneracy factor dg = 2(Nc2 \u2212 1) = 16 for the\nid\nSU (3) gluodynamics, \u03b5id\ng and Pg are the energy density\nand the pressure of the ideal gas of massive gluons. The\ntemperature-dependent function B(T ) in Eq. (3) results\nfrom the thermodynamical identity, see Ref. [14],\nT\n\ndP\n\u2212 P (T ) = \u03b5(T ),\ndT\n\n(5)\n\n\f2\n1.0\n\nwhich leads to the equation for B(T ):\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nQP model\nPanero, 2009\n\nWith the help of the Ansatz m\u0303gb (T ) = m0gb , i.e., that the\nglueball Breit-Wigner masses are given by the particle\ndata group (PDG) values,\n\u0393gb = bgb (T \u2212 Tgb ) \u0398(T \u2212 Tgb ) for Tgb < T < Tc (8)\n\nand recommended parameters bgb (0++ ) =4.23 and\nbgb (2++ ) =7.152, the relation (7) reproduces quite well\nthe lattice results in the measured range 0.5Tc < T <\nTc = 265 MeV [18]. In our consideration, we limit ourselves to the two above-mentioned species of glueballs,\nthe only ones for which lattice data are available.\nWith the temperature-dependent glueball masses, a\nstatistical treatment of glueballs needs an additional requirement of thermodynamic consistency. It has been\nsatisfied in the same way as outlined above for gluons;\nsee Eqs. (5) and (6) above.\nTo describe glue matter in the whole range of temperatures, we use the first-order phase-transition model in\naccordance with lattice results for GD. Thus, one should\nconjugate the pure gluon (g) and the glueball (gb) phases\nby making use of the Gibbs conditions at the transition:\nPg (Tc ) = Pgb (Tc ) .\n\n0.8\n\n(9)\n\nWe use the value Tc =265 MeV for the first-order phase\ntransition, in agreement with the lattice SU(3) GD [12,\n13, 19].\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b5/\u03b5\n\nP/P\n\nSB\n\n0.6\n\n0.04\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.02\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.00\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n2\n\nT/T\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n3\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n2\n\nT/T\n\nc\n\n3\n\nc\n\nFIG. 1: The reduced pressure (a) and the energy density (b)\nof the glue matter.

While the meson scattering amplitude is parametrically suppressed as 1/Nc , the scattering amplitude between glueballs scales as 1/Nc2 [15] and\ntherefore the system can be considered as a noninteracting Bose gas of glueballs. Expected glueball masses are\n> 1 GeV, and thereby only the lowest-lying\nhigh, mgb \u223c\nglueball states contribute to the EoS at the temperatures of our interest. It is difficult to single out which\nstates of the observed hadronic spectrum are glueballs\nbecause of a lack of knowledge of decay properties and\nthe existence of a strong mixing between glueballs and\nquark states [16]. However, using typical constant values\nfor the lowest-lying glueball masses within a statistical\nmodel, one fails to reproduce the strong increase of thermodynamical variables near Tc [17]. The T -behavior of\nmasses for two lowest-lying scalar 0++ and tensor 2++\nglueballs was investigated on the lattice in [18]. Therefore, below we follow the SU(3) lattice GD results. It\nwas shown that the pole mass mgb (T ), the Breit-Wigner\nmass m\u0303gb (T ), and the thermal width \u0393gb are linked as\nfollows :\nq\nmgb (T ) \u2248 m\u0303gb (T ) \u2212 2T + 4T 2 \u2212 \u03932gb (T ) .\n(7)\n\nTcg = Tcgb \u2261 Tc ,\n\nKarsch, 1996\n\n0.8\n\n(6)\nSB\n\nid\n\u03b5id\ndB(T )\ng \u2212 3Pg dmg\n=\u2212\n.\ndT\nmg\ndT\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.5\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nT/T\n\nc\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n1.5\n\nT/T\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\nc\n\nFIG. 2: The trace anomaly (a) and the reduced enthalpy or\nentropy (b) of the glue matter. All notations are the same as\nin Fig. 1.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we compare the model results for the pressure and the energy density with the lattice data. Values\nare normalized to those in the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB)\nlimit. Both \u03b5/\u03b5SB and P/PSB increase fast and monotonically with the temperature above Tc , but, as we see,\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann limit is not saturated up to 3Tc .\nTwo sets of lattice data are similar qualitatively, but old\ndata [20] are appreciably higher than the new ones [13] at\n> 1.5T . Note that the new lattice data are extended to\nT \u223c\nc\nthe region of the glueball phase, T < Tc . Our QP model\nis in a reasonable agreement with the new lattice data,\nexcept for the narrow vicinity to the left of Tc , where\nmodel predictions are evidently below the lattice points\n[see insertions in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b)]. Due to large\nglueball masses, this result is not changed if one adds the\nnext two to three glueball states to our two lowest-lying\nglueball states, although there exist statements claiming\nthat a good agreement with lattice data near Tc can be\nreached only if the whole high-lying glueball spectrum\n\n\f3\nof the Hagedorn-type [21] or glueball condensate [17] is\nadditionally included.\nThe interaction measure or trace anomaly (\u03b5 \u2212 3P )/T 4\nand the reduced enthalpy (\u03b5+P )/(\u03b5SB +PSB ) are demonstrated in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively. The presence of a nonzero trace for the energy-momentum tensor\nrelates to the breaking of the scale and conformal invariance. Again, a nice overall agreement is observed\nbetween the QP model and the new set of the lattice\ndata [13], including a region near Tc , for T > Tc . The\nreduced enthalpy in Fig. 2(b) for the pure gluon system\nis just the reduced entropy, s/sSB , which is thereby also\nreproduced by our QP model. Thus, we see that the\ndeveloped QP model successfully describes the thermodynamic properties of the glue matter.\n\nIII.\n\nCALCULATION OF VISCOSITY\nCOEFFICIENTS\n\nIn principle, it is possible to compute the shear and\nbulk viscosities directly from GD at finite temperature\nusing Kubo formulas. However, in practice, this is quite\ndifficult because GD is generally a strongly interacting\ntheory with an unknown mechanism of the confinement.\nEssential assumptions of our kinetic approach are that\nquasiparticles are well defined, elementary interactions\nare local, and the dynamics can be described in the\nrelaxation-time approximation.\nDerivation of viscosity coefficients starts with the expression for the energy-momentum tensor for quasi-free\n[43] boson quasiparticles of spices a :\n\u001a \u03bc \u03bd \u001b\nZ\npa pa\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTa = d\u0393\n(10)\nFa ,\nEa\nd\u0393 = da\n\nd3 p~a\n,\n(2\u03c0)3\n\np\u03bca = (Ea (~\npa , ~r), p~a ) ,\n\nwhere da is the degeneracy factor. The QP distribution\nfunction Fa fulfills the QP kinetic equation. We assume\nthat gluon and glueball masses are given by Eqs. (1) and\n(7), respectively. The QP energy is determined by\np\nEa (~\np) = p~ 2 + m2a (T, Fa ) .\n(11)\n\nBelow, we consider only collisional sources of the viscosity. Applying the relaxation time approximation to\nthe relativistic QP kinetic equation, we arrive at the expression for the variation of the energy-momentum tensor\n(10) near the local equilibrium state:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nXZ\np\u03bc p\u03bd\n, (12)\n\u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\nd\u0393 \u03c4a a 2a p\u03baa \u2202\u03ba Fa\nEa\nloc.eq.\na\nwhere \u03c4a denotes the relaxation time of the given species,\nwhich generally depends on the QP momentum ~pa .

Performing a variation in (12),\nwe did not vary quantities that may depend on the distribution function only implicitly, such as Ea , since by doing\nthis one may arrive at the relaxation-time form of the QP\nkinetic equation. Besides, in the gluon-glueball model\nused here, only equilibrium values ma (T ) are known and\nwe are actually not able to find \u03b4Ea [F ].\nThe shear and bulk viscosities can be expressed\nthrough the variation of the energy-momentum tensor\nas follows:\n~ * ~u \u2212 \u03b7 Wij ,\n\u03b4Tij = \u2212\u03b6 \u03b4ij \u2207\n2\nwith Wkl = \u2202k ul + \u2202l uk \u2212 \u03b4kl \u2202i ui .\n3\n\n(14)\n\nHere and below, Latin indices run 1, 2, 3.

Angular brackets denote a quantum-mechanical statistical average over an equilibrated system. However, one should\nbear in mind that averaged values \u03c4\u0303a\u22121 given by Eq. (18)\nyield only a rough estimate for the values \u03c4a\u22121 .\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\nRESULTS FOR VISCOSITIES\n\nBelow, the shear and bulk viscosities are calculated\nwith the help of Eqs. (15) and (16), respectively. The\nonly quantity that should still be specified is the relaxation time \u03c4\u0303a .\nCalculations of the relaxation time \u03c4\u0303a of partons already in the lowest order in the running coupling constant\ng 2 require summation of infinitely many diagrams. Resummation of the hard thermal loops results in the width\n\u03c4\u0303 \u22121 of partons \u223c g 2 T ln(1/g) [26]. Based on this fact, the\nfollowing parametrization was used for gluons [4, 27]:\n\u03c4\u0303g\u22121 = Nc\n\n2c\ng2T\nln 2 ,\n4\u03c0\ng\n\n(19)\n\nwith the strong interaction coupling constant (2) and a\ntunning parameter c. The relaxation time for a mixture\nof scalar and tensor glueballs was estimated according to\nEq.

Solid and dashed lines are for our QP\ntwo-phase gluon-glueball model with two different choices of\nthe coefficient c in Eq. (19); see the text for details. The\nvertical short-dashed line joins two boundary points of the\nmixed gluon-glueball phase. The dot-dashed line shows viscosity calculations with the relaxation time \u03c4\u0303g given by Eq.\n(20). The horizontal dotted line is the \u03b7/s = 1/4\u03c0 bound.\nThe lattice gauge SU (3) data with 163 * 8 and 243 * 8 lattice are from Refs. [29] (triangles and squares) and [30] (filled\ncircles). The shaded region corresponds to the perturbative\nresult (cited from [28]).\n\nComparison between the GD lattice data [29, 30] and\nour QP results for the shear viscosity of the glue matter\nis presented in Fig. 3. The magnitude of the \u03b7/s ratio in\nour model is defined mainly by the value of the relaxation\ntime (19). The solid line shows results of our calculation\nprovided we use the recommended value c =14.4, though\nour parameters of Eq. (2) are slightly different from those\nused in Ref. [4]. This c-value was tuned in Ref. [4] to the\nold lattice data for thermodynamic quantities [12]. As we\nsee, the \u03b7/s ratio gets discontinuity at T = Tc with more\n\nthan by an order of magnitude lower value at T \u2192 Tc + 0\n(in gluon phase) than at T \u2192 Tc \u2212 0 (in the glueball\nphase). Also, the solid curve lies reasonably close to the\npoints (filled circles, triangles, and squares) and its value\nin the minimum is slightly below the AdS/CFT (Anti de\nSitter/Conformal Field Theory) 1/4\u03c0 bound [31] (compare with the dotted curve). Preserving the form of the\nrelaxation time (19), we can still increase \u03b7/s values by\ntuning the parameter c. Taking c = 11.44, we achieve the\nlimit case \u03c4 \u0303g \u22121 \u2192 0 for T \u2192 Tc + 0 (full transparency).\nIn this case (see the dashed line in Fig. 3 for T > Tc ),\nwe may reach a slightly better overall agreement with\nthe lattice data [29, 30], and the 1/4\u03c0 bound is achieved\nat the minimum. Varying the c-value in the interval\n11.44 < c < 14.4, one may simulate different values of\n> 1.5T\nthe \u03b7/s jump at T = Tc , but for temperatures T \u223c\nc\nthe \u03b7/s ratio changes only slightly, demonstrating a slow\nincrease with the growing temperature. Thus, bearing in\nmind large error bars in the lattice data, we are able to\nconclude that the results of the two-phase gluon-glueball\nmodel developed here are consistent with the existing\nlattice results [29, 30]. The perturbative regime (see the\nshaded region) is not achieved up to very high temperatures.\nThe \u03b7/s ratio for the pure gluon phase in the range of\nT \u223c (1 \u2212 2)Tc was also evaluated in Ref. [32]. The model\nemploys the QP Ansatz for EOS successfully tested to\ndescribe old lattice results [28]. In Ref. [32], viscosity is\ntreated by means of the kinetic theory for gluon quasiparticles. It is of interest that the model, being consistent\nwith the old (and less accurate) lattice data for viscosity [28] and thermodynamics [20] that overestimate pres> 1.5T (as follows from the comparison with\nsure at T \u223c\nc\nnew data, see Fig. 1), predicts a stronger temperature\ndependence of \u03b7/s at T > Tc than our model, which in\nturn is consistent with the new lattice data [29, 30]. The\ncrucial point here is that the gluon relaxation time is\ndefined essentially differently:\n\u22121\n\u03c4\u0303BKR\n= a\u03b7 /(32\u03c0 2 )T g 4 log(a\u03b7 \u03c0/g 2 ) ,\n\n(20)\n\n\u22121\nwhere a\u03b7 =6.8. Here \u03c4\u0303BKR\n\u221d g 4 , coming from the\n2\n4\n\u03b1s \u223c g dependence of the gluon-gluon transport cross\nt\nsection \u03c3aa\n\u2032 in the relaxation-time expression (18), as was\nestimated in the early work of Hosoya and Kaiantie [36],\nwhereas the above used \u03c4\u0303g\u22121 \u221d g 2 [4, 27].\nThe \u03b7/s ratio obtained with the relaxation time (20)\nis plotted in Fig. 3 by the dot-dashed line. This re< 2T recovers that of Ref. [32], but it differs\nsult for T \u223c\nc\nsignificantly from those calculated with Eq. (19). Using recent lattice results for higher T [29], let us try to\nmake a choice between two parametrizations of relaxation\n> 10T , shear\ntimes (19) and (20). We observe that for T \u223c\nc\nviscosity calculations with (20) demonstrate a noticeable\ngrowth exceeding lattice data and even a perturbative\nestimate (\u03b7/s)pert \u2248 0.8 \u2212 1.0 for T \u2243 (2 \u2212 20)Tc. The\nperturbative result is taken from Fig. 2 of [28] (\u03b7 was calculated in [33] and s in [34]). In contrast, predictions of\nour QP model with relaxation time (19) are in reasonable\n\n\f5\n\nFor a single-component gas, this expression coincides exactly with the 25-years-old result of Gavin [38].\nChakraborty and Kapusta (CK) [39] presented another\nexpression [45],\n\u03b6CK =\n\nX da Z\na\n\nT\n\nd3 p\n\u03c4\u0304a Faeq (1 + Faeq )Q2a\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(22)\n\nwhich differs from (16) but also reduces to (21) for\nma = const. Note that they also disregard the QP interaction term in the energy-momentum tensor; see Eq. (99)\nof their work. The reasons for the differences between\n(16) and (22) are discussed in the Appendix. The dashdouble-dotted line in Fig. 4 demonstrates the \u03b6ChK /s\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.1\n-1\n\n0.01\n\n10\n\n\u03b6/s\n\nagreement with the lattice results and do not contradict\nperturbative estimates. Recently, the relaxation time \u03c4\u0303g\nwas estimated in Ref. [35] according to Eq. (18) from an\nanalysis of cross sections of the gg \u2192 gg and gg \u2192 ggg\nprocesses. It was found that \u03b7/s=0.13 and 0.076 for values \u03b1s =0.3 and 0.6, respectively [which correspond to\ntemperatures T /Tc =2.6 and 1.36 provided Eq. (2) is\nused]. If these points were plotted in Fig. 3, they would\nbe quite consistent with our QP model results. This can\nbe considered as an additional numerical argument in favor of using Eq. (19) as a rather appropriate phenomenological expression. However, we point out that the above\narguments do not allow us to choose between functional\ndependencies (19) and (20). One could also use expression (20) with a smaller coefficient a\u03b7 , choosing the latter\nvalue to fit the lattice results for the \u03b7/s ratio. Since uncertainties in the modern lattice data are large, we will\nnot do such an additional tuning restricted by the results\nthat we have demonstrated in Fig. 3.\nThe measured lattice points for the ratio of the bulk\nviscosity to the entropy density are plotted in Fig. 4 together with different model results. In a broad range of\ntemperatures, the global behavior of p\nlattice data can be\nroughly approximated as \u03b6/s = 0.02/ T /Tc \u2212 1 (see the\nshort-dashed curve). The reduced bulk viscosity \u03b6/s calculated in our two-phase gluon-glueball model following\nEqs. (16) and (19) is shown by the solid line for c = 14.4\nand by the dashed line for \u03c4\u0303g\u22121 vanishing at Tc . Values of \u03b6/s for both curves noticeably underestimate the\ncorresponding values on the approximating short-dashed\ncurve, typically by an order of magnitude. Nevertheless,\nthe shape of the curves is similar to that given by the\napproximating curve. Singularity at T \u2192 Tc + 0 demonstrated by the dashed line (see insertion in Fig. 4) is due\nto the divergence of \u03c4\u0303a in this limiting case.\nThe bulk viscosity (16) includes a rather complicated\nfactor Qa depending on the EOS used. Using the energy\nconservation for a system with temperature-independent\nmasses of particles, one may present the result (16) as\nfollows:\n\u00152\n\u0014 2\nX da Z d3 p\np\n~\neq\neq\n2\n\u03b6=\n\u03c4\nF\n(1\n+\nF\n)\n\u2212\nc\nE\n.(21)\na\na\na\na\ns\nT\n(2\u03c0)3\n3Ea\na\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0.8 1\n\n2\n\n10\nT/T\n\nc\n\nFIG. 4: The bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio for a\nglue matter.

The dash-double-dotted line is\nthe calculation result with Eqs. (22) and (19), and the dotdashed one is calculated according to Eqs. (23) and (20).\nThe perturbative estimate (24) is plotted by the dotted line.\nExperimental points are from [37] (empty squares) and [29]\n(filled circles). The thin short-dashed curve corresponds\nto a\np\nsimple approximating dependence \u03b6/s = 0.02/ T /Tc \u2212 1 to\nguide the eye.\n\nratio following Eq. (22) with the relaxation time \u03c4\u0304g = \u03c4\u0303g\ngiven by Eq. (19) (for \u03c4\u0303g\u22121 \u2192 0 at T \u2192 Tc + 0). We see\nthat Eq. (22) yields a strong T suppression of the bulk\n> 1.5T , as compared to that given by Eq.\nviscosity at T \u223c\nc\n(16) (compare the dash-double-dotted and dashed lines\nin Fig. 4).\nA somewhat different expression for \u03b6 was used by\nBluhm, K\u00e4mpfer, and Redlich (BKR) [32]. In their\nmodel, the bag constant B is a functional of the nonequilibrium distribution function. They found\nX da Z d3 p \u03c4a\n\u03b6BKR =\nFaeq (1 + Faeq )\n3 E\n3T\n(2\u03c0)\na\na\n\u0015\n\u0014\ndm2a (T )\n.\n(23)\n\u00d7 Qa m2a (T ) \u2212 T\ndT\nHere it was assumed that the QP interaction contributes\nto the energy-momentum tensor. Thereby, compared to\n(16) there appeared the second term T dm2a (T )/dT in the\nsquare brackets of Eq. (23). For constant masses, the latter equation is also reduced to (21). Numerical calculations with (23) (see the dot-dashed line in Fig. 4) give rise\nto the \u03b6BKR /s ratio, which dramatically decreases, being\nin large discrepancy with both the above models and the\nlattice data for T > 1.5Tc . For T > 1.9Tc, Eq. (23)\nbecomes invalid, providing negative values.\nA perturbative estimate [37] gives\n(\u03b6/s)pert \u2248 0.02\u03b12s\n\n(24)\n\nfor 0.06 \u2264 \u03b1s \u2264 0.3. Applying the T -dependent coupling\nconstant (2) for \u03b1s = g 2 (T )/4\u03c0, we get a perturbative\n\n\f6\nestimate of the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio\n(plotted by the dotted line in Fig. 4). As is seen, in\nthe region of its applicability, Eq. (24) produces only\nslightly larger values of \u03b6/s than those given by our QP\nmodel. The new lattice GD calculations demonstrate a\nsignificant increase of the ratio \u03b6/s at approaching the\ncritical point (\u03b6/s \u2243 0.5 \u00f7 2 at T = 1.02 Tc ). These\nvalues are reproduced neither by our QP model using\nrelaxation time Eq. (19) nor by the approximating shortdashed curve exploiting a simple T dependence of the \u03b6/s\nratio.\nComparing results presented in Figs. 3 and 4, we see\nthat in the gluon phase in a narrow vicinity of the critical\n< 0.1], the ratio \u03b6/\u03b7 > 0.1 reaches\npoint [for (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc \u223c\n\u223c\nthe value \u03b6/\u03b7 \u2243 0.3 for T \u2192 Tc +0. The ratio sharply decreases with an increase of the temperature up to values\n\u03b6/\u03b7 \u223c 10\u22122 \u00f7 10\u22123 for T > 2Tc . The smallness of this\nratio controls the violation of the conformal symmetry.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA quasiparticle approach has been applied to the\nSU (3) glue matter with temperature-dependent masses.\nMatching the pure gluon and glueball phase descriptions\nby means of the Gibbs conditions allows one to describe\nsuccessfully this system in a thermodynamically consistent way both above and below the critical temperature\nTc . For thermodynamic characteristics, the quasiparticle model results are in good agreement with the latest\nlattice data.\nThe constructed equation of state was used to calculate the shear and bulk viscosities in the relaxation-time\napproximation in a wide temperature range. The magnitudes of the shear and bulk viscosities are mainly determined by the value of the relaxation time. We exploited\ntwo different values for the relaxation time that have been\nused in the literature; see Eqs. (19) and (20). With the\nrelaxation time (19), the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio \u03b7/s fits rather well the scant lattice data. We\nfound that the ratio \u03b7/s undergoes a discontinuity at the\ncritical temperature T = Tc . At T slightly above Tc the\nratio \u03b7/s has a minimum, the value of which is close to\nthe AdS/CFT bound 1/4\u03c0. Then \u03b7/s increases with the\nsubsequent rise of the temperature. The bulk viscosity to\nentropy density ratio \u03b6/s also has a break at Tc . Then it\nmonotonically decreases with the temperature increase.\nAlthough the calculated \u03b6/s ratio essentially underestimates the upper limits given by the corresponding lattice\ndata, its temperature dependence is well described.\nWithin our model, the ratio \u03b6/\u03b7 \u2243 0.3 at T \u2192 Tc + 0\nand it sharply decreases with the rising temperature up\nto values \u03b6/\u03b7 \u223c 10\u22122 \u00f7 10\u22123 for T > 2Tc .\nWe point out that although our QP model describes\nwell the thermodynamical characteristics calculated on\nthe lattice it does not guarantee that all important\nphysics is incorporated, especially in a description of the\nvicinity of the critical point, where fluctuation effects are\n\nincreased. Using the averaged value for the relaxation\ntime can be considered only as a very rough approximation. The dependence of the relaxation time on the coupling constant g is also not well defined. Simplifying, all\nexisting approaches to the evaluation of the bulk viscosity use some Ans\u00e4tze reductions yielding different results.\nWe used the kinetic approach with the collisional source\nof the viscosity disregarding other possible sources [10].\nOne such source is associated with the presence of a soft\nmode [9] in the vicinity of the second and weak first-order\nphase-transition critical points. Also, since statistical error bars are very large, new more certain lattice data are\nrequired to draw a more definite conclusion on the agreement or disagreement of the calculated \u03b6/s ratio with the\nlattice results.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are thankful to D.

(38) and (40) in [25]. Here it was\nassumed that the collision term should be zero for\nthe global and local equilibrium states, i.e., for Fa =\nFaloc.eq.(Ea [F loc.eq.]).\nThen after setting Fa = Faloc.eq.(Ea [F loc.eq. ]) on the\nleft-hand side of the kinetic equation, one finds\n\u03b4Fa = \u2212\n\n\u03c4a [F loc.eq.] \u03bc \u2202Faloc.eq.(Ea [F loc.eq.])\np\n,\nEa [F loc.eq.] a\n\u2202x\u03bca\n\n(27)\n\nsee Eq. (2.3) in [22] and Eq. (42) in [25]. We stress\nthat all quantities on the right-hand side of this equation\nincluding the relaxation time \u03c4 are expressed in terms of\nthe local equilibrium distribution functions.\nTo derive expressions for the shear and bulk viscosities\n(15) and (16), one presents spatial components of the\nvariation of the energy-momentum tensor of quasiparticles (10) as\nXZ\nXZ\npi pk Faloc.eq.\npia pka\nik\n\u03b4Fa \u2212\n\u03b4Ea\nd\u0393 a2 a loc.eq.\n\u03b4T =\nd\u0393\nEa [F ]\nEa [F\n]\na\na\nXZ\npia pka\n\u03b4Fa .\n(28)\n\u2192\nd\u0393\nEa [F loc.eq.]\na\n\n\f7\nTo avoid cumbersome expressions we omitted antiparticle terms. The reduction done in the second line in\nEq. (28) is actually an Ansatz: we vary only the distribution function and do not vary quantities that depend\non the distribution function implicitly (through phasespace integrals incorporating the distribution function),\ni.e., \u03b4Ea [\u03b4F ] are set zero. This reduction is in the spirit\nof the relaxation-time approximation to the kinetic equation, where the momentum-dependent relaxation-time\nparameter is replaced in actual calculations by an averaged value. Note that dropping the \u03b4E term, we actually\nignore a sub-leading term in the case of a weak coupling\nconstant and/or for a very dilute system, see Eq. (5.22)\nof [40]. The distribution function \u03b4Fa counted from the\nlocal equilibrium value enters the expression for \u03b4T ik , the\nexpression for \u03b4T 00 = 0 [see (45) and (50) in [25]], and expressions for the viscosities. Thus one can easily compute\nkinetic coefficients knowing thermodynamic quantities in\nthe local rest frame ~u = 0.\nHowever, we should note that in the QP Fermi liquid theory following the work of Abrikosov and Khalatnikov [41], one usually uses a different procedure to\nobtain transport coefficients; see [42] for details. One\nexploits that in the original Landau collision term, the\nfollowing combination enters:\n!\nX\n\u03b4\nEa [F ] {F1 (E1 )F2 (E2 )(1 \u2213 F3 (E3 ))(1 \u2213 F4 (E4 ))\na\n\n\u2212F3 (E3 )F4 (E4 )(1 \u2213 F1 (E1 ))(1 \u2213 F2 (E2 ))} ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere Ea are functionals of the exact non-equilibrium distribution function, a = 1, 2, 3, 4. The term in curly brackets is zero not only for Fa = Faloc.eq.[Ea (F loc.eq. )] but\nalso for Faloc.eq.(Ea [F ]). Thereby, StFaloc.eq.(Ea [F ]) = 0.\nThus introducing\n\u03b4 Fea = Fa (Ea [F ]) \u2212 Faloc.eq.(Ea [F ])\n\n(30)\n\nin the relaxation-time approximation, we may rewrite the\ncollision term as\nStFa = \u2212\u03b4 Fea /\u03c4\u0304a [E(F )].\n(31)\n\nThe quantity \u03c4\u0304 [F ] entering Eqs. (31) and (22) depends\non the unknown exact non-equilibrium distribution function, since the \u03b4-function term in the collision integral\nand the local equilibrium distributions there continue to\ndepend on exact energies in this approach. If we want to\ncalculate the value of \u03c4 [F loc.eq. ] entering Eqs. (15) and\n(16) using Eq. (31), we should still expand E[F ] in (31)\nnear the known value E[F loc.eq.] everywhere including\nthe \u03b4-function term in the collision integral.\nFrom the left-hand side of the kinetic equation, one\ngets\n\u03b4 Fea = \u2212\n\n\u03c4\u0304a [F ] \u03bc \u2202Faloc.eq.(Ea [F ])\np\n.\nEa [F ] a\n\u2202x\u03bca\n\nThen one may use a simple expression for \u03b4T ik ,\nXZ\npi pk\nik\n\u03b4T =\nd\u0393 a a \u03b4 Fea\nEa [F ]\na\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nsince now variations are always performed at fixed Ea .\nAs above, the QP interaction term is omitted. Comparing the second line of Eqs. (28) and (33), we see that\ndisregarding the implicit dependence E[\u03b4F ], Refs. [22\u2013\n25] actually do not distinguish between distributions \u03b4F\nand \u03b4 Fe.\nThen in both considered approaches, one uses the exact\nrelation Ea [F ] = \u03b4T 00 /\u03b4Fa , i.e., that the variation of the\nenergy is determined through \u03b4Fa as\nXZ\n00\n\u03b4T\n=\nd\u0393Ea [F ]\u03b4Fa\na\n\n=\n\nXZ\n\nd\u0393Ea [F loc.eq. ]\u03b4Fa + O[(\u03b4F )2 ]. (34)\n\na\n\nFollowing (26) and (30), we have\n\u2202F loc.eq.(E[F loc.eq.])\n\u03b4F \u2212 \u03b4 Fe =\n\u03b4E.\n\u2202E\n\n(35)\n\nFurthermore, instead of using a complicated implicit dependence \u03b4E[\u03b4F ] with \u03b4F given by Eq. (27), which would\nbe the fully correct procedure, Ref. [39] uses the Ansatz\nrelations [see Eq. (102) of that work]\n\u001a\n\u001b\nE[F loc.eq.] E loc.eq.\ne\n\u03b4 F = exp \u2212\n\u03b4T,\n(36)\n2\nT [F loc.eq.] Tloc.eq.\n\u03b4E =\n\n\u03b4 Fe T 2 mdm\n\u03b4T mdm\n=\n,\nE dT\nF E 2 dT\n\nwhich assume that the distribution function in a nonequilibrium state has the form F = e\u2212E[F ]/T [F ] in the Boltzmann limit F \u226a 1. Thus, although Ref. [39] distinguishes between distributions \u03b4F and \u03b4 Fe , it uses very\nspecial relations (36), which might be incompatible with\n\u03b4E(m[\u03b4 Fe ]) as it follows from Eqs. (32) and (11).\nTo find bulk viscosity, one further expresses Fa =\nFaloc.eq.(Ea [F ])(1 \u2212 Aa \u2202\u03c1 u\u03c1 ), see Ref. [39], and one observes that the shift of the solution A(E) \u2192 A(E) \u2212 bE\ngenerates new solutions of the Landau kinetic equation\nfor arbitrary constant b. Then one chooses b to explicitly\nfulfill the Landau-Lifshitz condition u\u03bc \u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd = 0. Note\nthat this modification of the solution is quite unnecessary provided one guarantees that the condition \u03b4T 00 = 0\nholds in the local rest frame. We have checked that this\ncondition is satisfied in our QP model.\nFinally, within this approach one arrives at the expression (22) for the bulk viscosity, which is explicitly positive definite, whereas positive definiteness of Eq. (16) is\nnot seen explicitly. However, we stress once more that all\nquantities in (22) still depend on exact energies, while the\nway in which the quantities in (16) depend on unknown\nexact distribution functions is hidden. Thus explicit positive definiteness of expression (22) for \u03b6 presents actually only an apparent improvement. In any case, to use\nEq. (22) in practical calculations, where only equilibrium quantities are known, one should replace E[F ] by\nE[F loc.eq.].\n\n\f8\nMoreover, we should stress that the values of the relaxation time in (16) and (22) are different. Since we do\nnot perform complicated microscopic calculations of the\nrelaxation time but only estimate its average value, we\nactually cannot determine whether (16) or (22) is more\npreferable, and we may use both of them.\nNote that Eq. (23) is derived for a different model,\n\nwhere the QP interaction contributes to the energymomentum tensor. Also, authors of [32] use different\nvalue for the relaxation time.\n\n[1] E.V.
