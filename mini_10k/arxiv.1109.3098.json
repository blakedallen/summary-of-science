We present the first detailed spatio-kinematical analysis of the planetary nebula\nHaTr 4, one of few known to contain a post-Common-Envelope central star system. Based on\nhigh spatial and spectral resolution spectroscopy of the [Oiii] nebular emission line, in combination with deep, narrow-band imagery, a spatio-kinematical model was developed in order to\naccurately determine the three-dimensional morphology and orientation of HaTr 4. The nebula\nis found to display an extended ovoid morphology with an equatorial enhancement consistent\nwith a toroidal waist - a feature believed to be typical of central star binarity. The nebular inclination is found to be in good agreement with that determined for the binary plane, providing\nstrong evidence that shaping and evolution of HaTr 4 has been influenced by its central binary\nsystem - making HaTr 4 one of only 5 planetary nebulae to have had this observationally proven.\nKeywords. binaries: close, ISM: kinematics and dynamics, ISM: jets and outflows, planetary\nnebulae: general\n\n1. Introduction\nHaTr 4 is known to contain a non-eclipsing photometric binary central star with a period of 1.71 days (Bond et al. 1990). On first inspection of the original imagery presented\nby Hartl & Tritton (1985), HaTr 4 has the appearance of a classical butterfly bipolar\nnebula lying in the plane of the sky with twin lobes emanating in an East-West direction.\nHowever, deeper H\u03b1 + [Nii] imagery acquired by D. Pollacco shows faint extensions in\na North-South direction indicating that the bipolarity in fact lies perpendicular to that\ninferred from the original imagery. This deep narrow-band imagery, in combination with\nhigh-spectral and -spatial resolution spectroscopy acquired with VLT-UVES, have been\nused to derive a spatio-kinematic model of HaTr 4 in order to investigate the relationship\nbetween the PN and its binary central star (Tyndall et al. 2011a, 2011b). To date, only\nfour PNe have been observationally confirmed as having been shaped by their central\nbinary stars \u2013 Abell 63 (Mitchell et al. 2007), Abell 41 (Jones et al. 2010), Abell 65,\n(Huckvale et al. 2011) and NGC 6337 (Hillwig et al. 2010, Garc\u0131\u0301a-D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2009).\n\n2. Spatio-Kinematical Modelling\nUsing the astrophysical modelling program SHAPE (Steffen et al. 2011), a spatiokinematical model was developed in order to reconstruct the nebular morphology of\nHaTr 4. The nebular expansion velocity was assumed to follow a Hubble-type flow, and\nthe simplest best fitting model was an open-ended ovoid nebular shell waisted by a thick\nequatorial ring. The model accurately reproduces both the observed velocity profiles and\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAmy A. Tyndall, David Jones & Myfanwy Lloyd\n\nimagery. The model shows that the main nebula does in fact extend in a North-South, and\nnot East-West, direction, and that 'butterfly' appearance of the central nebular regions\nis due to a projection effect.\n\n3. Results\nHaTr 4 possesses an elongated, axisymmetric morphology with an equatorial enhancement consistent with a nebular ring. The 'butterfly' appearance of the central region is\nshown to result from a line-of-sight inclination effect associated with the enhanced nebular waist, rather than a bipolar structure. The modelling has revealed an age of order\n8200 years at a distance of 3 kpc, and an equatorial expansion velocity of 26\u00b14 kms\u22121\n- both fairly typical for PNe. No evidence is found for extended emission or jet-like outflows associated with the PN, such as those found in ETHOS 1 (Miszalski et al. 2011a)\nand The Necklace (Corradi et al. 2011).\nThe inclination of the nebular symmetry axis is found to be 75\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6 , consistent with\nthe non-eclipsing nature of the binary central star. Further investigation into the central\nstar system performed by Hillwig et al. (in preparation) and Bodman et al. (in press),\nindicates that the inclination of the central binary plane falls within a similar range to\nthat of the nebula as predicted by binary-induced PN shaping theories (Nordhaus &\nBlackman 2006). This alignment between the nebular symmetry axis and binary plane\nprovides strong evidence that HaTr 4 has been shaped by its central binary star, making\nit one of only five PNe to have had this link observationally shown (Jones et al. 2011).\nReferences\nBond, H., & Livio, M. 1990 ApJ, 355, 568\nCorradi, R.L.M., Sabin, L., Miszalski, B., Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Gil, P., Santander-Garc\u0131\u0301a, M., Jones, D.,\nDrew, J.E., Mampaso, A., Barlow, M.J., Rubio-D\u0131\u0301ez, M.M., Casares, J., Viironen, K., Frew,\nD.J., Giammanco, C., Greimel, R. & Sale, S.E. 2011, MNRAS, 410, 1349\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-D\u0131\u0301az, M.T., Clark, D.M., L\u00f3pez, J.A., Steffen, W. & Richer, M. 2009, ApJ, 699, 1633\nHartl, S., & Tritton, H. 1985 A&A, 145, 41\nHillwig, T.C., Bond, H.E., Af\u015far, M. & de Marco, O. 2010, AJ, 140, 319\nHuckvale, L., Prouse, B., Jones, D., Lloyd, M., O'Brien, T.J. & Pollacco, D. 2011, in: A.A.\nZijlstra, F.
