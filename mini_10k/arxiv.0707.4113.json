Mol. Phys. - FTC\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n2\n\nIn the last years, the experimental results concerning confined ultracold atoms in\noptical lattices have attracted much theoretical interest from many different fields,\nranging from condensed-matter physics to quantum information theory (see e.g.\n[1, 2]). The ability of tuning the fundamental physical parameters has provided\nan unrivaled tool to devise specific physical situations which, beyond their intrinsic\nphysical interest, can be employed as important simulation tools [1]. In particular,\nthe possibility to engineer a defect-free periodic potential appears as one of the\nmost intriguing characteristics of these systems. Such \"cleanness\" has allowed the\nexperimental realization of the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model and the observation of the\nsuperfluid-Mott quantum phase transition discussed by Fisher in his seminal paper\n[3], where, in addition, the issue of the effect of disorder on the physical properties of\nthe BH Hamiltonian was first addressed. Furthermore many experimental techniques\nsuch as laser speckle field [4] and the superposition of different optical lattices with\nincommensurate lattice constants [5, 6, 7] have recently substantiated the theoretical\ninvestigation of ultracold atoms in disordered optical lattices [8, 9], revealing a rich\nscenario of new physical situations such as the appearance of new phases (e.g. Boseglass phase [6, 7] ) and superfluid (SF) percolation in d-dimensional (d > 1) lattices\n[10, 11].\nIn this paper we will deal with the properties of a two-dimensional (2D) optical\nlattice where bosons are confined by an overall parabolic potential and subject to a\nrandom potential distribution.\nThe experimental realization of 2D lattices is discussed in [12], [13] and [14]. In\nparticular the latter represents a direct experimental realization of the Hamiltonian\ndiscussed in the present paper, when disorder is absent. A valuable feature of the setup\nhere considered is the possibility to investigate a wide range of physical situations and\ngeometries according to different external parameter choices. While the parabolic\npotential confines bosons in a disk-like domain, the interplay of the other external\nparameters (hopping amplitude and chemical potential), allows one to realize, for\nexample, Mott phases distributed in concentric shells, each with different filling,\nintercalated with SF shells. The 1D counterpart of this scenario has been thoroughly\nstudied in [15].\nHere we will focus particularly on the superfluid-phase spatial distribution in the\npresence of a random potential. We analyze first the situation where a (single) central\ndisk-like Mott region is surrounded by a thin SF shell, and then the case when the\nsystem is fully SF. We show that, in the first case, the quasi-1D SF domain is strongly\ninfluenced by the presence of \"impurities\", leading to the drop of the SF fraction\nfor a small increase of the disorder amplitude. In the second case, the genuine 2D\ngeometry of the SF domain leads to the formation of circulating streams which do\nnot disappear abruptly when the disorder amplitude is increased. In this respect our\nsetup therefore appears to be an effective tool to investigate the combined effect of\ndisorder and dimensionality on the SF properties of a bosonic system.\nThe system considered is modeled by a BH Hamiltonian H = HI + HT , with\nHI =\n\nM\nM\nM\nX\nX\nUX\na\u2020i Aij aj + h.c.\n\u03bci ni , HT = \u2212T\nni (ni \u2212 1) \u2212\n2 i=1\ni,j\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ni = a\u2020i ai , a\u2020i (ai ) represents\nP the creation (destruction) operator at site i, and\nthe total boson number N =\ni ni is a conserved quantity. The random on-site\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n3\n\neffective chemical potential \u03bci is given by\n\u03bci = \u2212\u03a90 (x2i + yi2 ) + \u2206i + \u03bc\n\n(2)\n\naccounting both for the noise distribution \u2206 (\u2206i = \u2206 * \u03bei with \u03bei uniformly distributed\nbetween 0 and 1) and for the parabolic confinement \u03a90 . The Hamiltonian parameters\nU and T represent the two-body interaction and the hopping amplitude between\nneighboring sites respectively, M is the total number of sites (in our simulations we\nhave chosen M = 312 = 961) and the matrix Aij is the so-called adjacency matrix,\nwhich is zero if sites i and j are not connected, and one otherwise.\nOur analysis is based on the mean-field decoupling scheme already exploited\nby many authors for the analysis of the disordered BH model [6, 10, 16]. For an\napplication of this scheme to a disordered system see [17]. Despite the well known\nshortcoming of not taking into account spatial correlations of quantum origin (see\ne.g. the discussion about spatial correlations in [18], and in particular Fig. 4\ntherein), this mean-field decoupling scheme has proven the ability to disclose and\nqualitatively characterize the prominent physical features of Bosonic atoms loaded in\noptical lattices, expecially in dimension greater than one (for a detailed discussion on\nthe MF scheme and its application see [19] and references therein). Note however that\nwe take into account the spatial dependence arising from the disordered+harmonic\nlocal potential, and hence - at least partially - the spatial correlations thereof. The\nessence of this approximation is the replacement of two-boson operators a\u2020i ai\u2032 with\nsingle-site operators weighted by mean-field parameters \u03b1i = h\u03c8|ai |\u03c8i (where \u03b1i \u2208 C\nand |\u03c8i represents the mean-field ground state). Namely\na\u2020i ai\u2032 \u2248 a\u2020i \u03b1i\u2032 + \u03b1\u2217i ai\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217i \u03b1i\u2032\n\nwith i \u2208 [1, . . . , N ]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1i s have to be determined by self-consistency standard procedure. P\nWithin this scheme, Hamiltonian H can thus be approximated by H \u2243 i Hi + h\nPM\nPM\nwhere h = T l=1 \u03b1\u2217i Ai l \u03b1l and parameters \u03b3i =\nl=1 Ai l \u03b1l in the single-site\n\u2020\n\u2217\nHamiltonian Hi = U ni (ni \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 \u03bci ni \u2212 T (\u03b3i ai + \u03b3i ai ) take into account the original\ninter-site coupling.\nMost of the the fundamental physical properties of the system can be obtained\nfrom the values of \u03b1i calculated from Hamiltonian H alone where T \u2208 R. However, in\norder to properly describe the SF properties of the system it is well known that one\nhas to go through same procedure with the introduction of the Peierls factors [20].\nThe Hamiltonian with the addition of the Peierls factors reads\nX\n(4)\ne\u2212i\u03b8Bij a\u2020i Aij aj + h.c. .\nH\u0303 = HI + H\u0303T , H\u0303T = \u2212T\ni,j\n\nThe quantity \u03b8Bij accounts for an infinitesimal velocity field v which can be\nconsidered as a \"probe\"\nR r to test the superfluidity properties of the system through the\nrelation \u03b8Bij = m/~ rij v * dr [21] where ri is the i-th site position. With the Peierls\nfactors H\u0303 becomes the Hamiltonian in the moving reference frame which is analogous\nto the Hamiltonian of a charged particle in presence of a magnetic field (see e.g. [21]).\nFor the determination of the response of the system, it is necessary to take the limit\n\u03b8 \u2192 0 and hence it is appropriate to consider the presence of the Peierls factors in\nperturbative terms with respect to the Hamiltonian H. Up to first order, it is possible\nto show that the mean-field parameters for the Hamiltonian H\u0303, corresponding through\nthe mean-field site-decoupling approach to the Hamiltonian H\u0303, assume the following\nform \u03b1i = \u03b10i exp [\u2212i\u03b8\u03c6i ], where \u03b10i represent the (real) mean-field parameter related\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n4\n\nto the Hamiltonian H, and the form of the phase term depends on the first order\napproximation in \u03b8.\nIn this paper we define the SF fraction (SFF) as the ratio between the current\noperator, as evaluated in Eq. (7), and the maximum possible SF current between two\nsites, i.e.\nP\n\u221a \u221a\nij h\u03c8|Jij |\u03c8i\nmax\nwith h\u03c8|Jij\n|\u03c8i = \u22122T ni nj Bij\nfs = P\n(5)\nmax |\u03c8i\nh\u03c8|J\nij\nij\n\nwhere we have employed the current operator defined as\n\u0011\n\u0010\nJij = iT exp[\u2212i\u03b8Bij ]a\u2020j ai \u2212 exp[i\u03b8Bij ]a\u2020i aj\n\n(6)\n\nwhich describes the supercurrent in the rotating (lattice) frame. Recalling Eq. (3),\nthe first-order approximation for the expectation value of the current operator can be\nwritten in the mean-field scheme as\nJij = h\u03c8|Jij |\u03c8i \u2243 \u22122T \u03b10i \u03b10j \u03b8 [\u03c6j \u2212 \u03c6i + Bij ] .\n\n(7)\n\nSo far, we have not explictly defined the structure of the site-dependent (through\nmatrix Bij ) Peierls factors. As suggested by the circular symmetry of the parabolic\npotential, we have considered by definition Bij an infinitesimal rotation around the\nparaboloid axis. The generated flow \u2013observed in the rotating frame\u2013 must be\nconstrued as a response to this infinitesimal rotation. To interpret correctly Figs.\n1, 2, and 4, where the spatial distribution of Jij is depicted, it necessary to recall that\nsupercurrents are depicted in the (rotating) lattice frame and hence, in the laboratory\nframe, the overall rigid-body rotation effect must be subtracted. The SFF at rest\nappears thus to be surrounded by a rotating rigid-body \u2013 in this case the non-SF\nfraction.\nIn the 1D homogeneous case fs vanishes iff \u03b1i = 0 (the standard condition\nfor Mott regime). In this case, the translational invariance of the system holds,\nentailing ni = nj = n, \u03b10i = \u03b10j = \u03b10 and \u03c6i = \u03c6j (overall phase coherence),\nthus Jij = 0 iff \u03b10 = 0. In 2D disordered case, conversely, Eq. 7 shows that the\ncondition fs = 0 is ensured either by \u03b1i = 0, like in the 1D homogeneous case, or,\nmore interestingly, by means of a phase rearrangement, which is determined by the\nconstraint \u03c6j \u2212 \u03c6i + Bij = 0, entailing the emergence of local clusters with \u03b1i 6= 0.\nIt is worth noticing that, for a uniform (\u03bci = \u03bc) 1D system, due to translational\ninvariance, Eq. (5) reproduces the mean-field behavior of SFF as defined in the\nliterature [22]\nP\n2\n\u03b12\nij 2T \u03b10 Bij\n= 0.\n(8)\nfs,1D = P\nn\nij 2T nBij\n\nThe identification of fs,1D with \u03b120 /n deserves some comments. In [23] it was shown\nthat the largest eigenvalue of the one-body density matrix \u03c1ij = h\u03c8|a\u2020i aj |\u03c8i/N is a\nmeasure of the condensate fraction fc . Within the mean-field scheme, it is possible to\nprove that the ratio h\u03b12i i/hni i\u2013 the space average hxi i (x = \u03b1, n) takes into account the\nlattice inhomogeneity due to the disorder\u2013, can\u0002 be related to the\u0001 largest eigenvalue\nof\n\u0003\nthe mean-field approximation of matrix \u03c1ij = h\u03c8|ni |\u03c8i \u2212 |\u03b1i |2 \u03b4ij + \u03b1\u2217i \u03b1j |/N and\nthus provides an estimate of the condensate fraction fc . In this spirit, for a uniform\nsystem, Eq. (8) satisfies the condition fc \u223c fs . From a more general point of view,\nsince the condition fc 6= 0 implies long range correlations, h\u03b12i i/hni i can be viewed as\na good coherence measure even for a disordered system.\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n5\n\nIn the numerical simulations we have analyzed two different situations. In the\nfirst case, we have evaluated the effect of noise on a configuration where a single central\nMott domain, with ni = 1, is surrounded by a SF shell (Fig. 1), exhibiting a ring\nsupercurrent. The parameters choice in this case has been performed in order to obtain\na quasi-1D ring-shaped domain. In the laboratory frame the latter corresponds to inert\nmatter decoupled from the lattice rotation owing to its SF character. This situation\nwas explored in [18], in absence of disorder[24]. In comparison, as a second case, we\nconsider a situation where a central disk-like SF region is present and, consequently,\nexhibits a 2D behavior.\n15\n1\n\n0.5\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n5\n\n0.6\n\ny/a\n\n<ni>\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\ny/a\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221215 \u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n\u221210\n\n15\n\n\u221215\n\u221215 \u221210 \u22125\n\nx/a\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx/a\n15\n\n0.035\n10\n0.03\n5\n\ny/a\n\n0.025\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.015\n\u22125\n0.01\n\u221210\n0.005\n\n\u221215\n\u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx/a\n\nFigure 1.

In the first case (T /U = 1.6 10\u22122, \u03a90 /U = 6 10\u22123 and \u03bc/U = 0.5\ncorresponding to Ntot = 199 total particles) the increase of the noise amplitude leads\nto the \"fracture\" of the ring with \u03b1i 6= 0 and to the drop of the SFF, leading the\nrearrangement of the SF flow within the new potential pattern (Fig. 2).\nIn the idealized situation of a perfect 1D ring domain, the presence of an impurity\ncutting the ring is sufficient to determine a sudden drop to zero in the supercurrent\ninduced by the velocity field. In the situation here depicted, due to the finite radial\nextent of the SF region such an impurity occupies an extended domain. In addition\nto this effect several vortices emerge which correspond to feeble supercurrents pinned\naround the sites with large (disorder-induced) local chemical potential \u03bci (see Fig.2,\nlower panel). It is worth noticing that in the laboratory frame, the extended impurity\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n6\n\ny/a\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\u221210\n\u221215\n\u221215\u221210\u22125 0 5 10 15\n\ny/a\n\nx/a\n0.18\n\n0\n\n\u03b1ij\n\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n\n\u22125\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n\n\u221210\n\nJij\n\n0.04\n0.02\n\n\u221215\n\u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx/a\n\ny/a\n\n15\n\n10\n\ny/a\n\n5\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\u221210\n\u221215\n\u221215\u221210\u22125 0 5 10 15\n\nx/a\n\n0\n0.18\n\n\u03b1ij\n\n0.16\n\u22125\n\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221215\n\u221215\n\n0.08\n\nJij\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\nx/a\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.02\n\nFigure 2.

(7). In a situation where disorder is weak,\nthe term Bij prevails, leading to a quasi-proportionality between the forcing term and\nthe SF flow. On the other hand, in presence of large disorder, the phase pattern is\nadjusted so as to satisfy the condition \u03c6j \u2212 \u03c6i \u2243 \u2212Bij . In this case the parameter\nh\u03b12i i/hni i, a good SFF measure for a homogeneous 1D system, while still being a\nmeasure of the local coherence of the system, can not be interpreted anymore as a\nmeasure of the SFF, since the presence of small clusters with \u03b1i 6= 0 will contribute to\nthe overall h\u03b12i i/hni i value but not to the SFF. Notice that here by \"small\" we refer\nto a three-site cluster, in that, in a 2D square lattice 4 sites are needed to close a loop\nand thus to support a current.\nFig. 3 shows that an increase of the disorder strength induces a sharp drop in\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n7\n\nthe SFF while leaving the quantum coherence of the system almost unchanged. Each\ndata point is the result of the average over 10 realizations of the random potential.\nFor sake of clarity, the errorbars are plotted every fifth data point. As we discussed\nabove, the sharp drop in the SFF corresponds to the interruption of the quasi 1D SF\ndomain characterizing the system in the absence of disorder\nA qualitative argument for the determination of the disorder-amplitude range\nin which the ring starts to break is to consider that, in the absence of disorder, the\nring is approximately 2-sites thick and with a radius of about 12 sites. Hence the\n\u0001\npotential energy difference between radially adjacent sites is about \u03a90 * 122 \u2212 112 .\nIn order to have superfluidity, the hopping\nmust be large enough to overcome the\n\u0001\npotential difference \u2206c \u2243 \u03a90 * 122 \u2212 112 , where \u2206c can thus be viewed as the disorder\namplitude corresponding to the drop in the SFF. As a consequence, if disorder-induced\nlocal potentials of up to the same amplitude are present, the SFF is not affected.\n0.06\n\n<\u03b12i >/<ni>, fs\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n\u2206/\u03a90\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFigure 3.

Error bars account for the\ndispersion of the numerical data around their mean value for 10 different disorder\nrealizations.\n\nCase II. The second setup has been conceived in order to analyze the effects of\ndisorder in a fully 2D SF domain. In this case, due to the more markedly SF character\nof the system, it has been necessary to consider much larger noise amplitudes to have\nobservable effects on the SF distribution. In Fig. 4 we have sketched the values for Jij\nand \u03b1i in a situation exhibiting a strong SF character (T /U = 0.1, \u03a90 /U = 3.6 10\u22122,\n\u03bc/U = 0.6 with Ntot = 313 ) for increasing values of the noise amplitude. Low values\nfor Jij on the lattice center are direct consequence of the velocity pattern imposed on\nthe lattice and must not be interpreted as the absence of superfluidity at the center\nof the trap. As previously discussed, in this case we have Jij \u221d \u2212Bij .\nFor increasing values of the ratio between the noise and the parabola amplitude\n( \u2206/\u03a90 ), as in Case I, the SFF, due to the rearrangement of the flow, has a slower\ndecrease than in the previous situation, due to the much larger SFF \u2013 note the scale\ndifference between Fig. 3 and Fig. 5.\nA prominent difference between Case I and Case II resides in the fact that the\nfirst one can be considered a quasi-1D case, and hence the \"cutting\" of the SF shell\nis analogous to the interruption of a 1D chain. The second case represents, on the\nother hand, a genuine 2D situation and, as it is possible to see in Fig. 4, the presence\nof noise leads to the formation of percolation patterns with nonzero circulation [10].\nThe supercurrents in this case will follow closed and possibly merging paths encircling\ndomains characterized by fs = 0 but h\u03b12i i/hni i =\n6 0. The latter shows then the survival\nof a local coherence character, connected to fc , even in the absence of supercurrents.\n\n\fDisordered 2D optical lattices\n\n8\n\ny/a\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\u221210\n\u221215\n\u221215\u221210\u22125 0 5 10 15\n\nx/a\n\n\u03b1\n\ny/a\n\nij\n\n0\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n\u22125\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n\u221210\n\nJ\n\n0.3\n\nij\n\n0.2\n\u221215\n\u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.1\n\nx/a\n\ny/a\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\u221210\n\u221215\n\u221215\u221210\u22125 0 5 10 15\n\ny/a\n\nx/a\n0\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n\u03b1ij\n\n0.7\n\n\u22125\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n\u221210\n\nJij\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\u221215\n\u221215\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.1\n\nx/a\n\nFigure 4.

[17],\nsupplies, in the thermodynamical limit, a possible characterization of a Bose-glass\nphase.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a theoretical study of the behavior of Bosonic\nultracold atoms in a 2D optical lattice with parabolic radial confinement with disorder.\nOur investigation has focused on the SF response both in the weakly and in the\nstrongly SF regime. Within our approximation scheme, we have shown that, in the 2D\ndisordered case, the absence of supercurrents is determined by two independent effects:\nthe (usual) vanishing of the parameters \u03b1i , and the phase rearrangement implied by\n\u03c6j \u2212 \u03c6i + Bij = 0. While the first effect can be related to the presence of a Mott phase\nin the thermodynamical limit, the second one, in the same limit, suggests the presence\nof a Bose-glass phase. In this framework, we have given a possible interpretation of\nthe mechanism through which superfluidity is destroyed by disorder.

Error bars account\nfor the dispersion of the numerical data around their mean value for 10 different\ndisorder realizations.\n\nanalysis evidences how, as a consequence of the phase rearrangement, the quasi-1D SF\ndomain is destroyed by the appearance of \"impurities\", with an ensuing drop of the\nSF fraction for a small increase of the disorder amplitude. Conversely, in Case II the\ngenuine 2D nature of the SF domain leads to a multiple-stream SF flow determined by\nthe increase of the disorder amplitude, with the consequent appearance of percolation\npatterns. In the laboratory frame, the strong-disorder sources in the rotating lattice\nhave an overall site-dependent dragging effect on lattice bosons indicating the presence\nof non-superfluid regions locally surrounded by flows of nonzero circulation.\nThe rich phenomenology here presented exhibits a complex interplay between\nparameters such as the hopping amplitude, the boson-boson interaction, the disorder\namplitude and the parabola coefficient. In view of the intrinsic interest from the\nexperimental point of view, this deserves a more systematic analysis we will perform\nelsewhere.\nReferences\n[1] D. Jaksch and P. Zoller.
