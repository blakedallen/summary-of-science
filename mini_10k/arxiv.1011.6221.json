In the present work we\nstudy these limits for TsT black-hole solutions which include B-field. The new Galilean\nsolutions describe a holographic RG flow from Schr\u00f6dinger (a = 2) spacetime in UV to a\nnonrelativistic universe in the IR.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are commonly two types of non-relativistic or Galilean string backgrounds, with\nbroken Lorentzian symmetries, which are a subject of favorable attention currently [2][23]. The geometries which possess Schr\u00f6dinger symmetries [2, 3] are given as written\nas\nds2Sch\n\n\u2212dx+ dx\u2212 + dx2i\n\u03b22\n= \u2212 2a (dx+ )2 +\nz\nz2\n\n!\n\n+\n\ndz 2\nz2\n\n(1)\n\nand the others with Lifshitz-like symmetries [4, 5] are written as\nds2Lif\n\n\u03b22\ndx2\n= \u2212 2a dt2 + 2i\nz\nz\n\n!\n\n+\n\ndz 2\n.\nz2\n\n(2)\n\nIn both these cases, xi (i = 1, ..., d) are flat spatial coordinates, x\u00b1 are the light-cone\ncoordinates, z is the holographic direction and parameter a is known as the dynamical\nexponent of the Galilean geometry. Some of these nonrelativistic geometries are claimed\nto be describing strongly coupled scaling phenomena near quantum critical points in dual\nnonrelativistic CFTs [2, 3]. The Schr\u00f6dinger AdS spacetimes with dynamical exponent\na = 2 can however be embedded in string theory as it has been shown in [6, 7]. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger spacetimes with a = 3 can also be found in the massive type IIA string\ntheory [16]. More recently, various Lifshitz spacetimes with light-like deformation were\nconstructed as string solutions, as shown in [19]. These solutions require nontrivial dilaton\nfield as well as metric deformations. Such solutions are further generalised in [20]. These\nrecent Lifshitz solutions do avoid the early 'no-go' results of [24] because the field ans\u00e4tze\nare some what less restrictive. This implies that a wider class of Lifshitz-like solutions\ncan be found in string theory if we suitably excite other fields in the Lifshitz background.\nThe hope is that some of these solutions could potentially describe interesting scaling\nphenomena in dual field theories where Lorentzian symmetry is explicitly broken and the\nsystem behaves quantum mechanically. Some new Lifshitz-like solutions with Janus-like\nconfigurations have been presented in [26].\n\n1.1\n\nA circle fibration over Lifshitz spacetime\n\nIn a recent work [1] we discussed a new type of nonrelativistic AdS5 geometry which had\none of the lightcone direction namely x+ (time) being null while x\u2212 being compact 1\ndr 2\n\u03b22\nds = \u2212r dx dx + 2 (dx\u2212 )2 + r 2 (dx21 + dx22 ) + 2\n4r\nr\n2\n\n2\n\n+\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n(3)\n\nIt was obtained by taking special vanishing horizon limits of 'boosted' black D3-brane\ngeometry. For the thermodynamics these limits correspond to taking 'zero' temperature\n1\n\nMost of our analysis in this work goes through even for the noncompact cases.\n\n2\n\n\f(or condensation) limits with vanishing chemical potential. The Galilean geometry (3)\nmay also be seen as a Lifshitz spacetime having a circle fibration\nds2 \u2261 ds2Lif4 +\n\n\u03b22 2\n\u039e\n4r 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere 4-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime is\nds2Lif4 = \u2212\n\ndr 2\nr6\n+ 2\n2\n2\n2\n(dx\n)\n+\nr\n(dx\n+\ndx\n)\n+\n,\n1\n2\n\u03b22\nr2\n\nand\n\n\u039e = (dx\u2212 \u2212\n\n2r 4 +\ndx ).\n\u03b22\n\n(5)\n\nThe size of the x\u2212 fiber varies all over the Lifshitz base. Since x\u2212 is a circle this geometry\nobviously cannot be trusted at large r where fiber size shrinks, nevertheless in some finite\nregion inside the bulk we can trust this classical background. We shall discuss how to\ninclude a boundary configuration in these solutions.\nIn this paper we wish to extend our analysis to include backgrounds with NS-NS Bfield. Specially we focus on the finite temperature T-s-T backgrounds obtained given in [7].\nOne useful feature of the TsT black-holes is that they are by construction asymptotically\nSchr\u00f6dinger geometries with dynamical exponent a = 2. We would like to study what\nhappens to these solutions under the 'vanishing' horizon double limits. The paper is\norganised as follows. In section-II we review the boosted black D3-brane solution and the\nvanishing horizon double limits where the black hole horizon shrinks to zero value while\nthe 'boost' is simultaneously taken to be very large. The solutions thus obtained describe\nzero temperature non-relativistic Lifshitz geometry. These solutions are not well defined\nat the boundary. We discuss the issue of the boundary and propose a new gravity solution\nwhich includes a finite boundary configuration. In section III we repeat our analysis for\nTsT black hole solutions which have asymptotic Schr\u00f6dinger symmetries. The section IV\nhas the conclusions.\n\n2\n\nSimultaneous double limits of 'boosted' black 3branes\n\n2.1\n\nReview\n\nThis section contains the review of our previous work [1]. We are particularly interested\nin studying the DLCQ of AdS5 geometry as described in [7]. We start with the 'boosted'\nversion of black D3-branes [7] where the near horizon solution is\ndr 2\n1 + f + \u2212 1 \u2212 f \u22122 + 2\ndx dx +\n[\u03bb (dx ) + \u03bb2 (dx\u2212 )2 ] + dx21 + dx22 + 2 + d\u03a925 ,\n=r \u2212\n2\n4\nfr\n5\nF5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(S )\n(6)\n\nds2D3\n\n!\n\n2\n\nwhere d\u03a925 is the line element of a unit size five-sphere S 5 . The function f (r) = 1 \u2212 r04 /r 4 ,\nwith r = r0 being the horizon location and the boundary is at r \u2192 \u221e. The overall AdS5\nradius, L, has been set to unity. The black D3-branes (6) have large but finite momentum\n3\n\n\falong compact direction x\u2212 , x\u2212 \u223c x\u2212 +2\u03c0r \u2212 . (We shall represent this circle as S\u0303 1 through\nout this paper as it will be present everywhere.) The boundary conformal field theory\nwill have a DLCQ description in a given (discrete) momentum sector. However, due to\nx\u2212 being compact, the geometry is well defined only in the interior region and not near\nthe boundary. It should however be kept in mind that, since x\u2212 is compact we simply\ncannot take r0 \u2192 0, as it will make x\u2212 a null direction.2 Note that in (6) the size of x\u2212\ncircle shrinks as we go near the boundary, but due to backreaction of the large lightcone\nmomentum it stays finite within the bulk where we can trust this solution.\nThe boost parameter \u03bb physically controls the size of x\u2212 . As we see that r04 \u03bb2 effectively\nmeasures the size of this circle, therefore we consider a combined limit in which the size\nof horizon is allowed to shrink while boost is simultaneously taken to be large such that\nr0 \u2192 0,\n\nr04 \u03bb2 = \u03b2 2 = fixed.\n\n\u03bb \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(7)\n\nIn which case we find [1]\n(1 + f ) \u2192 2 + O(r04),\n(1 \u2212 f )\u03bb2 \u2192\n\n1\u2212f\nr04\n\u2192\nO(\n)\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\n\u03b22\nr4\n\n(8)\n\nand the solution (6) simply reduces to\n\u03b22\ndr 2\n= r \u2212dx dx + 4 (dx\u2212 )2 + dx21 + dx22 + 2 + d\u03a925\n4r\nr\n5\nF5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(S )\nds210\n\n2\n\n+\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n(9)\n\nwhich itself is a complete solution of type IIB string theory at zero temperature. There is\nno curvature singularity. Actually the spacetime (9) is still a direct product of a 'constant\nnegative curvature spacetime' and a 5-sphere but it is a Galilean geometry and crucially\nthe coordinate x+ (time) is null. Here we must clarify our use of terminology a bit.\nThese 'Galilean' negative curvature spaces are spacetimes of constant negative curvature,\nR = \u221220, for which Ricci tensor is given by R\u03bc\u03bd = \u22124g\u03bc\u03bd , but the curvature tensor differs\nfrom being\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 \u221d \u2212(g\u03bc\u03bb g\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 g\u03bd\u03bb g\u03bc\u03c1 )\nusually by additive constants. So strictly speaking these Galilean spaces are not AdS\nspaces.3 However we could always rewrite (9) as\nds210 = ds2Lif4 +\n2\n\n\u03b22 2\n\u039e + d\u03a925 .\n4r 2\n\n(10)\n\nNote, it generally is not a problem when x\u2212 is noncompact, because in that case setting r0 = 0\nsimply describes an extremal (BPS) limit which takes us to an ordinary AdS spacetime whose holographic\ndual is N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory at large 't Hooft coupling.\n3\nSuch constant curvature spaces were previously known as Kaigorodov spaces in four dimensions [29].\nWe thank the anonymous referee for bringing up this fact to our knowledge and for the references [30, 29]\nwhere generalized Kaigorodov spaces are studied in the context of pp-waves.\n\n4\n\n\fTherfore the Galilean geometry (9) is indeed a Lifshitz four-universe along with a fibered\nproduct space S\u0303 1 \u00d7 S 5 . It will represent a well defined system of Kaluza-Klein particles\nif we compactify the solution to four dimensions. In particular, the 9-dimensional type II\nsolution schematically will be like\ndr 2\nr6\n= \u2212 2 (dx+ )2 + r 2 (dx21 + dx22 ) + 2 + d\u03a925\n\u03b2\nr\n3\n\u03b2\n8r\n(\u2212)\ne\u22122\u03c6 = , F2 \u2261 dA(\u2212) = \u2212 2 dr \u2227 dx+ ,\n2r\n\u03b2\n!\n\nds29\n\n(11)\n\nthere will be a scalar \u03c3 from internal metric component e2\u03c3 = G\u2212\u2212 which couples to the\nKK gauge fields A(\u2212) . There will also be 3-form tensor field as a result of the reduction of\nthe 4-form. That is we are effectively dealing with system of KK fields coupled to scalar\nfield and a dilaton field in 4-dimensional Lifshitz universe while rest of the directions are\nall compact.\nIn summary, taking the double limits (7) of the 'boosted' black D3-branes allows us\nto exclusively 'zoom onto' the KK system in a Lifshitz universe such as (11). The Lifshitz geometry (9) is inherently nonrelativistic. There is an asymmetric scale (dilatation)\ninvariance\nr \u2192 (1/\u03be)r, x\u2212 \u2192 \u03be \u22121x\u2212 , x+ \u2192 \u03be 3 x+ , x1,2 \u2192 \u03bex1,2\n(12)\nwhere time scales with scaling dimension 3 and therefore the dynamical exponent is 3.\nThere are also invariances under constant shifts (translations) as well as rotations in\nx1 \u2212 x2 plane, see [1]. However, (9) does not have any explicit invariance under the\nGalilean boosts\nx+ \u2192 x+ ,\n\nx\u2212 \u2192 x\u2212 \u2212 ~v .~x +\n\nv2 +\nx ,\n2\n\n~x \u2192 ~x \u2212 ~v x+ .\n\n(13)\n\nThus the solution (9) represents a geometry with broken Lorentzian symmetry in which the\ntime has dynamical exponent a = 3 and which upon compactification to four dimensions\nsimply gives us a Lifshitz universe along with scalar and gauge fields. The background\n(9) preserves at least 8 Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetries.\n\n2.2\n\nAdding a boundary and resultant RG flow\n\nThe classical solution (9) obtained under the vanishing horizon limits is devoid of an\nuseful description near the boundary at infinity because x\u2212 tends to become null there\nwhile being a compact direction. However, there may be other possible ways to tackle\nthis UV problem, in a rather adhoc manner we try to add a boundary configuration to\nthe geometry (9). So we write it down a little differently as\ndr 2\n\u03b22\n1\n= r \u2212dx dx + (1 + 4 )(dx\u2212 )2 + dx21 + dx22 + 2 + d\u03a925\n4\nr\nr\n5\nF5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(S )\nds210\n\n2\n\n+\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n5\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhich now includes a distinct UV configuration. We note, eventhough the solution (14)\nis obtainable from (9) by incorporating a shift x+ \u2192 x+ \u2212 41 x\u2212 , but with this shift the\nsolution (14) has got a new asymptotics. Further it no longer has the invariance under\nasymmetric scalings in (12). While asymptotically (in the UV region) the geometry (14)\nbecomes a pure anti-de Sitter spacetime\nds210\n\n=r\n\n2\n\n1\ndr 2\n\u2212dx dx + (dx\u2212 )2 + dx21 + dx22 + 2 + d\u03a925\n4\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n+\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the direction x\u2212 is no longer null. This asymptotic pure AdS space has a flat\nboundary metric but obviously in a 'shifted' light-cone basis and has a relativistic scale\ninvariance with dynamical exponent a = 1\nr \u2192 \u03be \u22121 r,\n\nx\u2212 \u2192 \u03be 1 x\u2212 ,\n\nx+ \u2192 \u03be 1 x+ ,\n\nxi \u2192 \u03bexi .\n\n(16)\n\nThe dual conformal field theory in the shifted light-cone coordinates will have a slightly\nchanged DLCQ description, see appendix. Particularly the lightcone energy spectrum\nwill be different. But the important thing to notice from (14) is that the size of the x\u2212\ncircle now remains finite in the UV region including at the boundary. There may be\nsome subtle issues involved in the CFT in doing this, as narrated above, but from gravity\npoint of view we have got a classical background which is well behaved in UV and good\nfor holographic study. Also as discussed in the appendix, there appears to be no major\ndifference in the two DLCQ descriptions so far as large lightcone momentum is involved.\nIn the deep IR region, as r 4 \u226a \u03b2 2 , the solution (14) becomes simply the Lifshitz solution (9) we started with. Thus the new type IIB background (14) describes a holographic\nflow of a DLCQ theory (with a = 1) in UV to a nonrelativistic Lifshitz theory (with\na = 3) in the IR.\n\n3\n\nVanishing horizon limits of TsT background\n\nHere we would like to focus on the 'TsT' black D3-brane solutions which have Schr\u00f6dinger\nlike asymptotic symmetry. These solutions have B field and can be obtained from (6) by\napplying a chain of T-dualities and a 'shift' [7]. The TsT solution in the string frame can\nbe written as\n!\n\n\u03b8\n1 + f + \u2212 1 \u2212 f \u22122 + 2\ndx dx +\n[\u03bb (dx ) + \u03bb2 (dx\u2212 )2 ] \u2212 ( )2 r 2 f (dx+ )2\n\u2212\nds = r H\n2\n4\n\u03bb\n\u0015\ndr 2 \u03b7 2\n+ ds2 (BKE )\n+ dx21 + dx22 + 2 +\nfr\nH\n2\u03c6\ne = 1/H, F5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(SE)\n\u03b8 r2\n[(1 + f )dx+ \u2212 (1 \u2212 f )\u03bb2 dx\u2212 ] \u2227 \u03b7\n(17)\nBN S =\n2\u03bb H\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b82r4\n\nwhere H(r) = 1+ r20 and \u03c6 is the dilaton field. The \u03b8 is the 'shift' parameter incorporated\nin the T-s-T duality [7] and it is also related to the non-commutativity parameter in lightlike noncommutative description of gauge theories [27]; also see [28]. The V ol(SE) is the\n6\n\n\fvolume form over the Sasaki-Einstein metric\nds2SE = ds2 (BKE ) + \u03b7 2 .\nand d\u03b7/2 = J is the K\u00e4hler 2-form over the base BKE which is K\u00e4hler-Einstein. Unlike\nthe 'boosted' black D3-branes of the last section the TsT black hole solutions (17) have\ndesired Schr\u00f6dinger asymptotics at infinity which is\nds2 = r 2 [ \u2212 dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3 2 r 2 (dx+ )2 + dx21 + dx22 ] +\ne2\u03c6 = 1,\n\ndr 2\n+ \u03b7 2 + ds2 (BKE )\nr2\n\nF5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(SE)\n2\n\nBN S = \u03c3r dx+ \u2227 \u03b7,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we defined \u03c3 = \u03b8/\u03bb. It has a scaling symmetry with dynamical exponent a = 2,\nsee [7] for further details.\nWe are now interested in applying the vanishing horizon double limits (7) on the TsT\nsolutions (17). In which case H \u223c 1, \u03c3 \u223c 0 and the resultant zero temperature solution\nis\ndr 2\n\u03b22\nds = r \u2212 dx dx + 4 (dx\u2212 )2 + dx21 + dx22 + 2 + \u03b7 2 + ds2 (BKE )\n4r\nr\n\u22122\u03c6\ne\n= 1, F5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(SE), BN S \u223c 0\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n+\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2212\n\n(19)\n\nwhich is a Lifshitz solution (9) discussed in the earlier section. That is Schroedinger\nasymptotics completely decouples from (19) under the double scaling limits given in (7).\nThere is however another distinct way of implementing these double limits which is as\nfollows. We shall now take the limits (7) but at the same time also scale the noncommutativity parameter \u03b8 such that \u03c3 stays finite. In which case the zero temperature TsT\nsolution is\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nds = r H\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b22\ndr 2\n\u2212dx dx + 4 (dx\u2212 )2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 r 2 (dx+ )2 + dx21 + dx22 + 2\n4r\nr\n+\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b72\n+ ds2 (BKE )\n+\nH\ne\u22122\u03c6 = H, F5 = 4(1 + \u2217)V ol(SE)\n\u03b22\nBN S = \u03c3r 2 H \u22121 [dx+ \u2212 4 dx\u2212 ] \u2227 \u03b7\n2r\n\n\u0015\n\n(20)\n\n2 2\n\nwhere H(r) = 1 + \u03c3r2\u03b2 . Note that this zero temperature solution (20) is a Schr\u00f6dinger\nsolution asymptotically (in UV) due to the presence of nontrivial B field, but it also\nhas got a nonrelativistic deformation which becomes prominent in the IR region. The\nparameter \u03b2 is effectively a measure of this IR deformation. Let us now investigate what\nhappens in the deep IR region where r 2 \u226a \u03c3 2 \u03b2 2 . In this region\n2\u03c6\n\ne\n\nr2\n\u2248 2 2,\n\u03c3 \u03b2\n\nso as the string coupling becomes weaker the solution (20) flows into\n7\n\n(21)\n\n\f\u03b22\nr2\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212dx\ndx\n+\n(dx\u2212 )2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 r 2 (dx+ )2 + dx21 + dx22\nds = r\n\u03c32\u03b2 2\n4r 4\ndr 2\nr2\n+ 2 + 2 2 \u03b7 2 + ds2 (BKE )\nr\n\u03c3 \u03b2\n!\n6\n1\nr2\nr\n+ 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2248 \u2212 2 (dx ) + r (dx1 + dx2 ) + 2 (\u039e)2 + 2 2 \u03b7 2 + ds2 (BKE )\n\u03b2\n4\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03b2\n1\nBN S \u2248 \u2212 \u039e \u2227 \u03b7 .\n2\u03c3\n2\n\n2\n\n!\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(22)\n\nThe above solution (22) is a nontrivial configuration at zero temperature but there is no\nscaling symmetry which survives in this deep IR region unless we scale parameter \u03c3. A\nnon-relativistic scale (dilatation) transformation may be written as\nr \u2192 \u03be \u22121r,\n\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u03be \u22121 \u03c3,\nx+ \u2192 \u03be 3 x+ ,\n\nx\u2212 \u2192 \u03be \u22121 x\u2212 ,\n\nx1,2 \u2192 \u03bex1,2 .\n\n(23)\n\nSo under this asymmetric scaling a solution like (22) with given \u03c3 will tranform into\nanother solution with a new \u03c3 parameter. 4\nIn summary, from solutions (19) and (20) we note that these TsT spacetimes supported\nby nontrivial string fields would have a Lifshitz (a = 3) or asymptotic Schroedinger symmetries (a = 2) depending upon the presence of B field in them. Particularly background\n(20) is a nontrivial solitonic configuration with B-field for which as we go from IR region to the UV region, it basically flows to a Schr\u00f6dinger spacetime (with a = 2). The\ncorresponding holographic dual will be a nonrelativistic CFT at zero temperature with\nsuitable operater deformation giving rise to this flow. In the absence of any B field the\nzero temperature limits provide a Lifshitz universe (19).\nAlthough the x\u2212 radius becomes constant in (22), but we should be careful about of\nthe size of the Hopf circle \u03b7 in this region. In the deep IR region where\nL2\n\nr2\n\u2264 ls2 ,\n\u03c32\u03b2 2\n\nL being the AdS radius, we cannot trust the classical string geometry (22) as the size of\nfibre \u03b7 will become sub-stringy there.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have reviewed the vanishing horizon double limits r0 \u2192 0, \u03bb \u2192 \u221e of 'boosted'\nblack D3-branes having a compact lightcone direction. The zero temperature Lifshitz\nsolutions obtained as a result of taking these limits are not well defined in the UV,\n4\n\nHowever, let us specifically note that all the thermodynamic properties of the TsT black holes do not\nat all depend upon this non-commutativity parameter [7]. This is due to manifest duality symmetry of\nthe effective 8-dimensional string theory.\n\n8\n\n\fhowever by suitably adding appropriate boundary configuration we have been able to\nconstruct a different solution (14). These boundary configurations correspond to pure AdS\nspacetime. The particle spectrum has got shifted energies. The solution (14) describes\na flow from AdS universe in UV to a = 3 Lifshitz universe in IR. We also study similar\nzero temperature limits for TsT black hole solutions which involve B-field. Resulting zero\ntemperature solutions describe an RG flow from Schr\u00f6dinger spacetime (a = 2) in UV to\na nonrelativistic universe in the IR which has no apparent scaling symmetry. The latter\nclass of Galilean solutions have an instability in the deep IR where the fibre direction\nover the K\u00e4hler base becomes sub-stringy. The main distinction between two types of\nsolutions is the presence of B-field.\nAcknowledgements:\nI am grateful to the AS-ICTP, Trieste for the hospitality where this work got culminated\nand for the financial support under the Associateship program. We are very much thankful\nto the anonymous referee for the comments which led to major corrections.\n\nA\n\nNon-relativistic theories and DLCQ:\n\nLet us consider a theory with the following (d + 2)-dimensional flat spacetime metric\n1\nds2 = \u2212dx+ dx\u2212 + (dx\u2212 )2 + d~x2\n4\n\n(24)\n\nwhere x\u00b1 = t \u00b1 y are the lightcone coordinates. We shall denote the respective conjugate\nmomenta by p\u00b1 , and the indices can be raised up by using the metric. Then the mass\nshell condition, p\u03bc p\u03bc = 0, for a 'massless' particle will become\n4p+ p\u2212 \u2212 ~p2 + (p+ )2 = 0\n\n(25)\n\nIn these coordinates if we identify \u22122p\u2212 = M, M being actual rest mass, and the lightcone\nenergy as E+ \u2261 \u2212p+ , then we can have\nE+ =\n\nq\n\np~2 + M 2 \u2212 M.\n\n(26)\n\nIt can be easily seen that if we set E+ = E \u2212 M, Eq.(26) is precisely the standard\nrelativistic mass shell relation for a free particle in Minkowski space with mass M and\ntotal energy E in (d + 1) dimensions. So the lightcone energies are just shifted from E to\nE+ = E \u2212 M. The relation (26) remains valid even in the massless case (p\u2212 = 0).\nThe momentum (\u2212p\u2212 ) is a continuous variable so far. We can discretize it by compactifying x\u2212 direction on a circle, (x\u2212 \u223c x\u2212 + 2\u03c0r \u2212 ), so that \u2212p\u2212 will be quantized as rN\u2212\nfor (N \u2265 0). Thus the spectrum is separated into discrete mass sectors characterised by\nN. This is known as discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) of a relativistic theory, see\nfor further discussion [7] and references therein. It is clear from the energy-mass relation\n(26) that a nonrelativistic limit in our DLCQ theory is achieved only when we focus on a\n9\n\n\fgiven momentum sector with very large N, which means a large M. In the limit of very\nlarge M, p~2 \u226a M 2 , we get from (26)\nE+ \u2243\n\np~2\n+***\n2M\n\n(27)\n2\n\nwhere the * * * indicates suppressed relativistic corrections like the standard M( ~vc2 )2 etc.\nThus in a large light-cone momentum sector the DLCQ theory is precisely a non-relativistic\ntheory.\nNotice the difference, the DLCQ of a relativistic theory in ordinary Minkowski metric\n2\nds = \u2212dx+ dx\u2212 + d~x2 gives a mass shell condition where lightcone energy is\np~2\nE+ = \u2212p+ =\n(\u22124p\u2212 )\n\n(28)\n\nwhich looks like the energy of a non-relativistic particle of mass M \u223c \u22122p\u2212 from start.\nHowever, in reality Eq.(28) can be trusted as a nonrelativistic expression only in the large\nmomentum sectors with N \u226b 0, i.e. when p~2 \u226a \u2212p\u2212 . There is also a subtle issue here\nparticularly involving the massless modes (p\u2212 = 0), where the DLCQ needs to be treated\ndifferently, see [25].\nWe however see that the two expressions (26) and (28) coincide in the large momentum\nsectors which is of our immediate interest for the DLCQ in the gravity where we have\nincluded backreaction due to the large lightcone momentum. This analysis shows that\nthe large lightcone momentum sectors are indeed non-relativistic.\n\nReferences\n[1] H. Singh, [arXiv:1009.0651 [hep-th]].\n[2] D. T. Son, Phys. Rev.
