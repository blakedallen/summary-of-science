Fragiadakis, R. Casalini, and C.M. Roland\nNaval Research Lab, Chemistry Division, Code 6120, Washington, DC 20375-5342\n(August 31, 2011)\nABSTRACT. Recently a new approach to the determination of dynamic correlation lengths, \u03be,\nfor supercooled liquids, based on the properties of the slow (picosecond) vibrational dynamics,\nwas carried out [L. Hong, V.N. Novikov, and A.P. Sokolov, Phys. Rev. E 83, 061508 (2011)].\nAlthough these vibrational measurements are typically conducted well below the glass transition\ntemperature, Tg, the assumption is that the structure of the liquid is frozen at Tg, so that the \u03be\ncharacterize dynamic heterogeneity in the supercooled liquid state. We compare \u03be from this\nmethod to values calculated using an approximation to the four-point dynamic susceptibility. For\n26 different materials we find good correlation between the two measures; moreover, the\npressure dependences are consistent within the large experimental error. However, \u03be from Boson\npeak measurements above Tg have a different, and unrealistic, temperature dependence.\n_____________________________________________________\nA universal feature of liquids approaching their glass transition is an increasing length\nscale for the correlations between molecular rearrangements. This property, and the associated\nspatial heterogeneity of the motions, are inherent to the many-body dynamics and must be\naccounted for by theories of the glass transition [1]. This requires reliable data quantifying the\ndynamic correlation length, \u03be. An immediate difficulty is unambiguously defining the distance\nover which motions are correlated, given the fractal nature of the heterogeneous dynamics.\nVarious approaches have been applied to the determination of \u03be [2,3]. The maximum value of the\ndynamic susceptibility, \u03c74, yields the number of dynamically correlated molecules, Nc [4];\nhowever, since \u03c74 involves both spatial and temporal correlations, it cannot be obtained from\nlinear relaxation measurements without assumptions. Berthier et al. [5,6] proposed an\napproximation in terms of the temperature derivative of the experimentally accessible, two-point\ndynamic correlation function, \u03c7T(t)\n\n\f2\n\uf0b6C (t )\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e6 \uf044c\n\uf0a3 T \uf02d1 \uf0e7 P \uf063 4 (t ) \uf0f7\n\uf063 T (t ) \uf03d\n\uf0b6T\n\uf0e8 k\n\uf0f8\n\n1/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \uf044cP is the isobaric heat capacity change at Tg, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The lower\nbound on the number of dynamically correlated molecules is\n\nNc \uf0b3\n\nk 2\n2\nT \uf05b max \uf063 T ( t )\uf05d\n\uf044c P\n\n(2)\n\nmax \uf063 T (t ) representing the maximum value of \uf063T (t ) for any state point. If the dielectric loss has\nthe Kohlrausch form with a stretch exponent, \uf062, that varies only weakly with temperature (which\nis true around Tg), eq. (2) can be written as [7]\nk \uf0e6 \uf062 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 d ln \uf074 \uf061 \uf0f6\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7\n\uf0f7\n\uf044cP \uf0e8 e \uf0f8 \uf0e8 d ln T \uf0f8\n2\n\nNc \uf0b3\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere e is Euler's number.\nConfidence in the validity of \u03c7T as an approximation to \u03c74 draws from several observations:\n(i) The number of particles involved in dynamic heterogeneities near Tg has a reasonable\nmagnitude (ca. 100) [6,7,8,9,10].\n(ii) The increase in Nc is strongest at temperatures approaching Tg, in accord with the\ndivergence of the relaxation time near Tg.\n(iii) Although the \u03c7T approximation becomes less accurate at temperatures above Tg, due to\nan increasing contribution from (neglected) density fluctuations, Nc from \u03c7T decreases\nto negligible values at sufficiently high temperature, consistent with molecular motions\nbecoming non-cooperative [8].\n(iv) Molecular dynamics simulations (mds) comparing the approximate Nc from \u03c7T and\nexact values from \u03c74 agree over the supercooled regime [9,11]. And close to the glass\ntransition, experimental Nc from \u03c7T are in agreement with the correlation length\ndetermined by multi-dimensional NMR [5].\nAn alternative means to quantify \u03be recently developed by Hong et al. [12,13,14] is based on\nthe fact that dynamic heterogeneities are manifested in the fast (picosecond) dynamics [15,16].\nDynamic heterogeneity in the glassy state has been observed by mds: mobile particles, defined as\nthose having large vibrational amplitudes, have a propensity to be surrounded by mobile\nparticles, and less mobile particles tend to have a disproportionate number of immobile\n\n\f3\nneighbors [17]. Although these clusters are more compact than those observed above Tg [17], the\ncessation of relaxation below the glass transition freezes in structural inhomogeneities, resulting\nin an excess density of states and responsible for the Boson peak in the inelastic scattering of\namorphous solids. Spatial fluctuations of the local elastic constants induce corresponding\nfluctuations in the vibrational amplitudes (mean squared displacements), with the length scale of\nthe fluctuations, \u03beBP, inversely proportional to the frequency of the Boson peak, \u03bdB [18]\n\n\uf078 BP \uf03d S c /\uf06e B\n\n(4)\n\nwhere c is the transverse sound speed and the constant S is about equal to unity. The implication\nis that structural heterogeneities intrinsic to the glassy state can be identified with the dynamic\nheterogeneities detected in the supercooled liquid by relaxation measurements [12,13,14].\nExperimental confirmation that \u03beBP is indeed a measure of the correlation length relevant\nto the dynamics of supercooled liquids has thus far been limited to comparisons involving four\nmaterials (glycerol, sorbitol, OTP, and polyvinylacetate) [13] that had previously been studied by\nmulti-dimensional NMR. The NMR method enables an exact determination of \u03c74, but only in the\nvicinity of Tg [19]. In this report we compare \u03beBP to dynamic correlation lengths determined from\n\n\uf063 T (t ) for twenty-six materials, including inorganic glass-formers and molecular and polymeric\norganic liquids. To do this we convert the number of correlating molecules calculated from eqs\n(3) to a length scale using [10,20]\n\n\uf078 \uf063 \uf03d \uf028 N cVm \uf029\n\n1/3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Vm is the molecular volume. Eq (5) ignores any string-like character [4] of the cooperative\nvolume and provides, for a given Nc, an upper bound for the correlation length.\nIn Figure 1 we plot the \u03beBP reported in refs. [12,13] versus \u03be\u03c7, using for the latter literature\nresults [21] for the quantities in eq (3) and the equations of state used to calculate Vm. All the\ncorrelation lengths in Fig. 1 correspond to Tg: \u03be\u03c7 was determined from quantities measured at Tg,\nand although the Boson peak was measured for the glass, the structure is assumed to have\nbecome fixed at the glass transition, so that the \u03beBP correspond to the values at Tg. The two\nmeasures of the dynamic correlation length are seen to be in good agreement, Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficient equal to 0.84. Even though the Nc from eq (3) is a lower bound, the \u03be\u03c7 in\nFig. 1 are typically about 40% larger than the \u03beBP; however, this is in part an artifact of using eq\n\n\f4\n(5) to convert the number of correlating molecules to a length scale. Assuming a spherical\nvolume [22], \u03be\u03c7 and \u03beBP would be more nearly equal in magnitude.\nAnother comparison of the two measures of correlation lengths is their change for a given\nmaterial with temperature and pressure. Hong et al. [12] reported \u03beBP versus pressure for seven\ncompounds; these results, normalized by the ambient pressure values, are reproduced in Figure 2\nfor the three materials (OTP, polyisoprene, and polymethylphenylsiloxane) for which \u03be\u03c7 could be\ncalculated. For pressures up to 1.4 GPa, the changes in \u03beBP do not exceed 30%; however, as\nnoted by Hong et al. [12], the data are contradictory concerning whether the correlation length\nincreases or decreases with pressure.\nWe showed previously that when isochronal superpositioning [1] is valid, the change in\nNc with pressure is given by [8]\nN c ~ \uf0281 \uf02b \uf067\uf061 PT \uf029 / \uf044c p\n2\n\n(6)\n\nin which \u03b1P is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient and \u03b3 the scaling exponent in the\nequation relating the structural relaxation time, \u03c4\u03b1, to temperature and density, \u03c1 [1,23]\n\n\uf074 \uf061 \uf03d f (T \uf072 \uf02d\uf067 )\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b3 is a material constant, and since the change with pressure of the heat capacity difference at Tg\nbetween the liquid and glassy states is negligible [24,25], the variation of Nc(Tg) in eq. (6) with\npressure is governed by changes in the quantity (1+ \uf067\u03b1PTg). At ambient pressure the product \u03b1PTg\nis a near universal constant (the Boyer-Spencer rule [26]), but this quantity decreases for a given\nmaterial with pressure. This change can be assessed from the pressure-dependence of the isobaric\nfragility [8]\n\nmp \uf03d mV \uf0281 \uf02b \uf067\uf061 PTg \uf029\n\n(8)\n\nwhere mV is the (pressure-independent [27]) isochoric fragility. (Note from eqs (6) and (8) that\nthe dynamic correlation length cannot correlate with the fragility.) Experimentally for van der\nWaals liquids, mp has been found to decrease about 10% over the range from ambient to 0.5 GPa\n[27], implying about the same variation in \u03beBP over the larger pressure range in Fig. 2. This\nvariation is within the scatter for the data, although the correlation length for normal liquids is\nunambiguously a decreasing function of pressure, notwithstanding the behavior of \u03beBP for OTP.\nAlso plotted in Fig. 2 are \u03be\u03c7 calculated using eqs (5) and (6) for these three materials, at\npressures for which the required data were available; again we normalize by the ambient pressure\n\n\f5\nvalue for each. The magnitudes of the changes with pressure are similar to those for \u03beBP, but \u03be\u03c7\nalways has the expected inverse dependence on P. One significant difference between the\ndeterminations of \u03beBP and \u03be\u03c7 is that while data for the latter were obtained directly at Tg(P), for\n\u03beBP the Boson peak was actually measured at 140K, following application of pressure at room\ntemperature and subsequent cooling to induce the transition to the glassy state. This method\nrelies on the assumptions that the structure of the glass is fixed, and there is no significant effect\nof temperature per se; therefore, the dynamic correlation length measured in the glassy state\nrepresents the value expected for the supercooled liquid at Tg.\nIn Figure 3 the two correlation lengths for OTP and glycerol at ambient pressure are\nplotted as a function of temperature normalized by Tg. \u03be\u03c7 decreases with increasing temperature,\nwith the steepest change being around the glass transition (and steeper for OTP than for glycerol,\nthe former the more fragile liquid [28,29]). In contrast, \u03beBP shows negligible change with\ntemperature, behavior that cannot be reconciled with our understanding of the glass transition.\nIndeed, the fact that the dynamic correlation length depends primarily on \u03c4\u03b1 [1,8] means that \u03be\nmust change markedly in the vicinity of Tg. Note that whereas the \u03beBP in Figs. 1 and 2 were\nmeasured below Tg, thus corresponding to values at the glass transition, the results in Fig. 3 were\nbased on measurements of the liquids; that is, at T > Tg. It is unclear whether the structure is\nactually liquid-like, since the time scale (ps) of the vibrational measurements is shorter than \u03c4\u03b1.\nThe dependence of \u03be on \u03c4\u03b1 also is at odds with the suggested correlation of the former with the\nactivation volume ( \uf044V # \uf03d RT \uf0b6 ln \uf028\uf074 \uf029 \uf0b6P T ) [12]. As pointed out by Hong et al. [12], one\npossibility is that the prefactor S in eq. (4) is temperature dependent.\nIn summary, correlation lengths calculated as the ratio of the transverse sound speed and\nthe Boson peak frequency, both measured in the glassy state, correspond well to values of the\ndynamic correlation length at Tg determined using an approximation to the four-point dynamic\nsusceptibility. However, \u03beBP measured for the liquid above Tg have an unrealistic T-dependence,\nsuggesting a disconnect between low frequency structural relaxation and THz vibrational\nmeasurements on the liquid state.\nWe thank Vladimir Novikov for kindly providing data from ref.

Dynamic correlation length defined as the ratio of the transverse sound speed to the\n\nBoson peak frequency measured at 140K versus the same quantity at Tg calculated from the\napproximation to the 4-point dynamic susceptibility. The fitted line has a slope = 0.68, with a\nPearson correlation coefficient as indicated.\nFigure 2. Dynamic correlation length calculated from eq. (3) (open symbols) and eq.(4) (filled\n\nsymbols) and normalized by the value at ambient pressure, as a function of pressure for oterphenyl (circles), 1,4-polyisoprene (squares), and polymethyphenylsiloxane (diamonds). The \u03be\u03c7\ndata are at the pressure-dependent Tg, while for \u03beBP the samples were pressurized at room\ntemperature and then quenched to 140K, which is below the glass transition temperature in each\ncase.\nFigure 3. Dynamic correlation length normalized by the value at Tg calculated using eq. (3)\n\n(open symbols) and eq.(4) (filled symbols) plotted versus temperature over Tg, for glycerol\n(circles) and o-terphenyl (squares).\n\n\f9\n\n3.5\n\uf032\uf034\n\n3.0\n\uf078BP [nm]\n\n\uf032\uf031\n\nR=\n\uf035\n\n2.5\n\uf031\uf037\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n\uf031\uf033\n\n\uf031\uf036\n\uf031\uf039\n\n\uf031\uf035\n\uf032\uf030\n\uf031\uf034\n\n\uf031\uf038\n\uf031\n\uf038\n\n1.5\n\n\uf037\n\n\uf036\n\n2.0\n\n\uf032\n\n\uf039\n\n2.4\n\n\uf033\n\uf031\uf030 \uf031\uf031\n\n\uf034\n\uf031\uf032\n\ninorganic\n1 B2O3\n2 CKN\n3 GeO2\n4 Se\n5 SiO2\n\nmol. liquids\n6 1-propanol\n7 glycerol\n8 2PG\n9 PG\n10 sorbitol\n11 DBP\n12 3PG\n13 m-toluidine\n14 cumene\n15 salol\n16 OTP\n\n2.8\n3.2\n3.6\n1/3\n\uf078\uf063\uf020\uf03d\uf020(Ncvm)\n[nm]\n\n0.8\n\n4\n\n\uf032\uf032\n\n4.0\n\n1.10\n\nT = Tg(P)\n\n1.00\n0.95\n\nOTP\n\n\uf078BP - filled\n\n\uf078\uf020/ \uf0780\n\n1.0\n\n\uf078\uf063 - open\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\npolyisoprene\n\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\nPMPS\n0.0\n\nFigure 2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6 0.8 1.0\nP [GPa]\n\n1.2\n\n\uf032\uf035\n\npolymers\n17 PIB\n18 PPG\n19 PI\n20 PnBMA\n21 PVAc\n22 PDMS\n23 PMPS\n24 polycarbonate\n25 PMMA\n26 PS\n\nFigure 1\n\n1.05\n\n\uf032\uf036\n\n\uf032\uf033\n\nP = 0.1 MPa\n\n1.4\n\n4.4\n\n\f10\n\n1.2\n\n\uf078BP\n\n\uf078(T) / \uf078(Tg)\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nglycerol\nOTP\n\n\uf078\uf063\n\n0.6\nP = 0.1 MPa\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\nT/Tg\n\nFigure 3\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n\f"}
