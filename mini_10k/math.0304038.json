We\ndiscuss applications and links with other constructions.\n\nKeywords: Strongly homotopy Lie algebra, homotopy algebra, derived\nbracket, Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebra, Poisson bracket, homotopy fiber\n\n1. Introduction\nStrong homotopy Lie algebras (\"strongly homotopy\", sh Lie algebras, L\u221e algebras) were defined by Lada and Stasheff in [25] (see also [24]). According\nto Stasheff (private communication), this notion was \"recognized\" by him\nwhen algebraic structures such as string products of Zwiebach (see [36]),\nand similar, started to appear in physical works. Before that, Schlessinger\nand Stasheff [31] realized that the notion of L\u221e -algebra was relevant to\ndescribing the higher order obstructions occurring in deformation theory,\nthough this was not described in the paper [31]. Notice also the work by\nRetakh [27]. The associative counterpart of the L\u221e -algebras, Stasheff's\nA\u221e -algebras became widely known much earlier. Currently, all kinds of\nhomotopy algebras and structures related to them attract great attention.\nIn part, this is due to their applications such as in Kontsevich's proof of\nthe existence of deformation quantization for any Poisson manifold. For an\noperadic approach to such algebras, see [26].\nIn this paper, we give a rather general algebraic construction that produces strong homotopy Lie algebras (and related algebras) from simple data.\nNamely, we consider a Lie superalgebra L with a projector on an Abelian\nsubalgebra obeying a \"distributivity\" condition (2). There are many examples of such projectors. Now, given this, an element \u2206 defines a sequence of\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nn-ary brackets on the image of the projector P as\n{a1 , . . . , an } := P [. . . [[\u2206, a1 ], a2 ], . . . , an ]\nwhere ai are in the image of P . We call them higher derived brackets and\nwe call \u2206 the generator for the derived brackets. We prove that for an odd\n\u2206, the n-th Jacobiator of these derived brackets (i.e., the LHS of the n-th\nJacobi identity of the L\u221e -algebras) exactly equals the n-th derived bracket\nfor the element \u22062 . Hence, if \u22062 = 0, our construction leads to strong homotopy Lie algebras. We can weaken the condition \u22062 = 0 still obtaining\nthe Jacobi identities of higher orders. This naturally occurs in examples.\nParticularly interesting applications of this construction are to higher Poisson brackets and brackets generated by a differential operator, which give\nan important example of a (strong) \"homotopy Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebra\".\nOur construction as a particular case contains the well-known description of\nL\u221e -algebras in terms of homological vector fields. Though it is a generating\nelement \u2206 that plays a key role in the main examples, it is also possible to\ngive a similar construction of higher derived brackets taking as a starting\npoint an arbitrary odd derivation d : L \u2192 L; in particular, this allows to\ngive a homotopy-theoretic interpretation of higher derived brackets.\nIn Section 2 we introduce the setup and recall the notion of L\u221e -algebras\n(in a form convenient for our purposes). In Section 3 we state and prove the\nmain theorem. Sections 2 and 3 are purely algebraic and self-contained. In\nSection 4 we consider some examples of applications. In Section 5 we return\nto algebra, giving a sketch of the generalization of our construction for noninner derivations and applying it to a homotopy-theoretic interpretation.\nFinally, in Section 6 we discuss related works, links with our results and\ndirections for further study. (Among other things we explain the role of P\nand the necessity of higher brackets, compared to a binary derived bracket\nas in [20].)\nTerminology and notation. We work in the Z2 -graded (super) context,\ne.g., a vector space means a 'Z2 -graded vector space', etc. Tilde over a\nsymbol denotes parity. (A parallel treatment for the Z-graded context is\npossible.)\nAcknowledgements. I am deeply grateful to Hovhannes Khudaverdian,\nKirill Mackenzie and Taras Panov for stimulating discussions. Special thanks\ngo to Martin Markl and Jim Stasheff for their remarks on the first version of\nthis text. I am particularly grateful to Jim Stasheff for his detailed comments\nand for suggesting numerous improvements of style. An anonymous referee\nof the paper suggested to look into a relation between higher derived brackets\nand homotopical algebra in the spirit of Quillen. I want to thank him for\nthis fruitful idea.\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n3\n\n2. Setup and preliminaries\nLet L be a Lie superalgebra. Consider a linear projector P \u2208 End L,\nP 2 = P , such that the image of P is an Abelian subalgebra:\n[P a, P b] = 0\n\n(1)\n\nfor all a, b \u2208 L. Let P also satisfy the following distributive law w.r.t. the\ncommutator:\nP [a, b] = P [P a, b] + P [a, P b].\n(2)\nThis identity is a convenient way of expressing the requirement that the\nkernel of P is also a subalgebra in L (not necessarily Abelian). Consider\nan arbitrary odd element \u2206 in L. Using these data, P and \u2206, we shall\nintroduce a sequence of n-ary brackets on the vector space P (L) \u2282 L, the\nimage of the projector P , and check that upon certain conditions they will\nmake it into a strongly homotopy Lie algebra. More precisely, we shall\nsee how the corresponding identities are controlled by the properties of the\nelement \u22062 = 21 [\u2206, \u2206] and arise step by step.\nLet us give some examples of a projector P .\nExample 2.1. Let V = V0 \u2295 V1 be a Z2 -graded vector space, which we also\ntreat as a supermanifold. The origin 0 is a distinguished point. Take as L\nthe superalgebra Vect(V ) of all vector fields on the supermanifold V w.r.t.\nthe usual Lie bracket. Let P take every vector field to its value at the origin\nconsidered as a vector field with constant coefficients. One can check that\nthe map P : X 7\u2192 X(0) satisfies (2).\nExample 2.2. Let A be a commutative associative algebra with a unit, and let\nL = End A (the space of all linear operators in A) with the usual commutator\nof operators as a bracket. The map P : \u2206 7\u2192 \u2206(1) maps every operator to an\nelement of A, which can be identified with an operator of left multiplication.\nThe image of P is an Abelian subalgebra in End A. Again, a direct check\nshows that P satisfies (2).\nExample 2.3. Let M be a supermanifold, and T \u2217 M its cotangent bundle.\nTake as L the Lie superalgebra C \u221e (T \u2217 M ) w.r.t. the canonical Poisson\nbracket. Define P as the pullback of functions on T \u2217 M to M . C \u221e (M )\ncan be treated as a subspace of C \u221e (T \u2217 M ); in particular, it is an Abelian\nsubalgebra. It is directly checked that P satisfies (2). In view of the relation\nbetween the commutator of operators and the Poisson bracket, this example\ncan be seen as a 'classical counterpart' of Example 2.2.\nLet us recall the definition of a strongly homotopy Lie algebra due to\nStasheff. In a form convenient for our purposes it reads as follows.\nDefinition 1. A vector space V = V0 \u2295 V1 endowed with a sequence of\nodd n-linear operations, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , (which we denote by braces), is\na (strongly) homotopy Lie algebra or L\u221e -algebra if: (a) all operations are\n\n\f4\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nsymmetric in the Z2 -graded sense:\n{a1 , . . . , ai , ai+1 , . . . , an } = (\u22121)\u00e3i \u00e3i+1 {a1 , . . . , ai+1 , ai , . . . , an },\nand (b) the \"generalized Jacobi identities\"\nX\nX\n(\u22121)\u03b1 {{a\u03c3(1) , . . . , a\u03c3(k) }, a\u03c3(k+1) , . . . , a\u03c3(k+l) } = 0\nk+l=n\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(k, l)-shuffles\n\nhold for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Here (\u22121)\u03b1 is the sign prescribed by the sign\nrule for a permutation of homogeneous elements a1 , . . . , an \u2208 V .\nHenceforth symmetric will mean Z2 -graded symmetric.\nThe notation is such that the parity of each operation \"sits\" at the opening\nbracket, which should be regarded as an odd symbol w.r.t. the sign rule. A\n0-ary bracket is just a distinguished element \u03a6 := {\u2205} in L. Recall that a\n(k, l)-shuffle is a permutation of indices 1, 2, . . . , k + l such that \u03c3(1) < . . . <\n\u03c3(k) and \u03c3(k + 1) < . . . \u03c3(k + l). Below are the generalized Jacobi identities\nfor n = 0, 1, 2, 3:\n{\u03a6} = 0,\n\n(5)\n\n{{a}} + {\u03a6, a} = 0,\n\n(6)\n\n{{a, b}} + {{a}, b} + (\u22121)\u00e3b\u0303 {{b}, a} + {\u03a6, a, b} = 0,\n\n(7)\n\n{{a, b, c}} + {{a, b}, c} + (\u22121)b\u0303c\u0303 {{a, c}, b} + (\u22121)\u00e3(b\u0303+c\u0303) {{b, c}, a}\n+{{a}, b, c} + (\u22121)\u00e3b\u0303 {{b}, a, c} + (\u22121)(\u00e3+b\u0303)c\u0303 {{c}, a, b}\n\n(8)\n\n+{\u03a6, a, b, c} = 0.\nWe shall call the L\u221e -algebras with \u03a6 = 0, strict.\nFor strict L\u221e -algebras, the Jacobi identities start from n = 1, and in (4)\nthe summation is over k > 0, l > 0. The identities (6)\u2013(8) for strict L\u221e algebras simplify to\nd2 a = 0,\n\n(9)\n\nd{a, b} + {da, b} + (\u22121)\u00e3b\u0303 {db, a} = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nd{a, b, c} + {{a, b}, c} + (\u22121)b\u0303c\u0303 {{a, c}, b} + (\u22121)\u00e3(b\u0303+c\u0303) {{b, c}, a}\n+ {da, b, c} + (\u22121)\u00e3b\u0303 {db, a, c} + (\u22121)(\u00e3+b\u0303)c\u0303 {dc, a, b} = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nif we denote the unary bracket as d := { }. That is, d acts as a differential, it\nhas the derivation property w.r.t. the binary bracket, and the usual Jacobi\nholds for the binary bracket with a homotopy correction. The identities\nwith n > 3 impose extra relations for this homotopy and all the higher\nhomotopies (hence 'strongly' in the name).\nAs the operations {a1 , . . . , an } are multilinear and symmetric, they are\ncompletely determined by the values on coinciding even arguments: {\u03be, . . . , \u03be}\nwhere \u03be is an even element of V (to this end, extension of scalars by odd\nconstants should be allowed). A generating function for these operations can\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n5\n\nbe conveniently written as a (formal) odd vector field on the vector space V\nconsidered as a supermanifold:\nX 1\n\u2202\n(12)\nQ = Qi (\u03be) i :=\n{\u03be, . . . , \u03be }.\n\u2202\u03be\nn! | {z }\nn>0\n\nn\n\nThe elements of V are identified with (constant) vector fields as u = ui ei \u2194\nui \u2202i . If we denote the n-th Jacobiator, i.e., the LHS of (4), by J n (a1 , . . . , an ),\nit is clear that J n also give multilinear symmetric operations on V . Hence\nthey are, too, defined by their values on equal even arguments. The expression simplifies greatly, and we have\nn\n\nJ (\u03be, . . . , \u03be) =\n\nn\nX\nl=0\n\n\b\nn!\n{\u03be, . . . , \u03be }, \u03be, . . . , \u03be\nl! (n \u2212 l)! | {z } | {z }\nn\u2212l\n\n(13)\n\nl\n\nfor an even \u03be. Abbreviating J n (\u03be, . . . , \u03be) to J n (\u03be) we can write a generating\nfunction as\nX 1\nJ :=\nJ n (\u03be),\n(14)\nn!\nn>0\n\nwhich is an even (formal) vector field on the supermanifold V . One can\ndirectly see that J = Q2 = 12 [Q, Q]. Hence all the Jacobi identities can be\ncompactly written as Q2 = 0. Notice that for strict L\u221e -algebras the vector\nfields Q and J = Q2 vanish at the origin.\nRemark 2.1. There is a difference between the sign conventions of our Definition 1 and the 'standard' definitions of the L\u221e -algebras as in [25, 24].\nIt comes from two sources. First, there is a choice between the 'graded'\n(= Z-graded) and 'super' viewpoints. Second, in supermathematics one\ncan choose between 'symmetric' and 'antisymmetric' constructions using\nthe parity shift. In [25, 24] all vector spaces are Z-graded, but not 'super',\nand brackets are antisymmetric in the graded sense, i.e., involving the usual\nsigns of permutations together with the 'Koszul signs' coming from the Zgrading. We prefer to work with the 'super' conventions where all the signs\ncome from the Z2 -grading (but not from any extra Z-grading be it present),\nand our brackets are (super) symmetric. This has an advantage that it allows to use geometric language and certain signs are simplified (e.g., the\nsigns of permutations do not enter). On the other hand, the definitions\nin [25, 24] include directly the ordinary Lie algebras as a particular case. A\npassage from [25, 24] to our conventions consists in introducing a Z2 -grading\n(parity) as the degree mod 2 and applying the parity shift. Notice that it\nreverses the parities of brackets with even numbers of arguments and turns\nantisymmetric operations into symmetric. More precisely, let \u03a0 be the parity reversion functor. Suppose V = \u03a0g. If we relate operations in V and g\nby the equality\n\u03a0[x1 , . . . , xn ] = {\u03a0x1 , . . . , \u03a0xn } (\u22121)\u03b5 ,\n\n\f6\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nxi \u2208 g, where \u03b5 = x\u03031 (n \u2212 1) + * * * + x\u0303n\u22121 , then (assuming that all brackets\nin V are odd), the brackets in g with an even number of arguments will\nbe even and with odd will be odd; the antisymmetry of brackets in g is\nequivalent to the symmetry of brackets in V ; the Jacobi identities in the\nform of [25, 24] for the brackets in g, extending the ordinary Jacobi identity\nfor Lie algebras, are equivalent to the Jacobi identities in the form (4) for the\nbrackets in V . One might prefer to call such a V = \u03a0g, an 'L\u221e -antialgebra'.\nHowever, we shall stick to Definition 1 throughout this paper. Notice that\nour conventions are close to those in [36].\nRemark 2.2. In almost all standard approaches to L\u221e -algebras there is no 0ary bracket or, rather, it is assumed that the corresponding element \u03a6 = {\u2205}\nis zero. (Except in [36] and some other physical works; the algebras with\na non-zero \u03a6 = {\u2205} are called sometimes 'weak' or 'with background'.)\nHence the standard L\u221e -algebras are always 'strict' in our sense. We have\nallowed for a 0-ary operation because \u03a6 6= 0 does occur naturally in some\nour examples, and even where it does not, including it sometimes simplifies\nthe exposition.\n3. Main theorem\nLet us return to the setting described above, i.e., a Lie superalgebra L\nwith a projector P on an Abelian subalgebra, and an element \u2206 \u2208 L. Forget\nfor a moment about restrictions on \u2206.\nDefinition 2. For an arbitrary element \u2206 \u2208 L, even or odd, we call the n-th\nderived bracket of \u2206 the following operation on the subspace V := P (L) \u2282 L:\n{a1 , . . . , an }\u2206 := P [. . . [[\u2206, a1 ], a2 ], . . . , an ] ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere ai \u2208 V . Here n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , .\nWe get a set of n-ary operations (15) on the space V . Clearly, they are\nmultilinear and of the same parity as \u2206. (For n = 0, we get \u03a6 := {\u2205} =\nP (\u2206).) Notice that they are always symmetric. Indeed, for the interchange\nof a1 and a2 , since [a1 , a2 ] = 0, we have [[\u2206, a1 ], a2 ] = \u2212(\u22121)\u03b5\u00e31 [a1 , [\u2206, a2 ]] =\n \u0303 Hence\n(\u22121)\u03b5\u00e31 +\u00e31 (\u03b5+\u00e32 ) [[\u2206, a2 ], a1 ] = (\u22121)\u00e31 \u00e32 [[\u2206, a2 ], a1 ], where \u03b5 = \u2206.\n{a1 , a2 , . . . , an }\u2206 = (\u22121)\u00e31 \u00e32 {a2 , a1 , . . . , an }\u2206 .\nSimilarly for other adjacent arguments. For the coinciding even arguments\nof the n-th derived bracket we have\n{\u03be, . . . , \u03be }\u2206 = P (\u2212 ad \u03be)n \u2206\n| {z }\n\n(16)\n\nn\n\n(which is reminiscent of the n-th derivative of an f (x) at a point x0 ).\nIn the sequel we shall be particularly interested in the derived brackets of\nan odd element \u2206 and of its square \u22062 = 21 [\u2206, \u2206].\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n7\n\nn (\u03be) for the derived brackLet \u2206 \u2208 L be odd.

In the setup of Theorem 1, if \u22062 = 0, the derived brackets of\n\u2206 make V an L\u221e -algebra.\nThis allows a generalization, which naturally comes up in examples.\nDefinition 3.

In the setup of Theorem 1, if ordV \u22062 6 r , then the derived\nbrackets of \u2206 satisfy the Jacobi identities of orders n > r.\nWe call the algebras given by Corollary 2, L\u221e -algebras of order > r.\nNotice that any higher Jacobi identity includes all n-brackets with n =\n0, 1, . . . . As above, we can speak about strict L\u221e -algebras of order > r if the\n0-bracket \u03a6 vanishes. A natural question is, when one can split the element\n\u03a6 = P (\u2206) from the Jacobi identities of orders n > 1 and simply drop the\n0-ary bracket from consideration. This happens if \u03a6 is an annihilator of all\nn-brackets, n = 2, 3, . . . . Besides an evident case \u03a6 = P (\u2206) = 0, a sufficient\ncondition is P [\u2206, P (\u2206)] = [\u2206, P (\u2206)]. See examples in the next section.\n4. Applications\nIn this section, we consider some examples of applications of Theorem 1\nand Corollaries 1, 2.\nExample 4.1. Consider a vector space V , with the algebra L = Vect(V ) and\nthe projector P as in Example 2.1. Take as \u2206 an arbitrary odd vector field\nQ \u2208 Vect(V ),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n1 l j i k\n1 j i k\n\u2202\nk\ni k\nk\n.\nQ = Q (\u03be) k = Q0 + \u03be Qi + \u03be \u03be Qij + \u03be \u03be \u03be Qijl + . . .\n\u2202\u03be\n2\n3!\n\u2202\u03be k\nThe derived brackets of Q,\n{a1 , . . . , an }Q = [. . . [[Q, a1 ], a2 ], . . . , an ](0) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere ai \u2208 V are identified with the corresponding constant vector fields,\nare given by the coefficients of the Maclaurin expansion:\nQ0 = Qk0 ek ,\ndei := {ei } = (\u22121)\u0131\u0303+1 Qki ek ,\n\n{ei , ej } = (\u22121)\u0131\u0303+\uf6be\u0303 Qkij ek ,\n\n{ei , ej , el } = (\u22121)\u0131\u0303+\uf6be\u0303+l\u0303+1 Qkijl ek , . . . ,\nfor the basis ei . Here we denoted \u0131\u0303 = \u1ebdi . These are precisely the brackets on\nV for which the vector field Q (or, rather, its Maclaurin series) is the generating function (12). Hence for Q2 = 0 we recover the 1 \u2212 1-correspondence\nbetween L\u221e -algebras and homological vector fields. Moreover, we see that it\nis given by the explicit formula (21). Set Q0 = 0. Then the algebra is strict.\nFor vector fields on V , the order w.r.t. the subalgebra of constant vector\nfields V \u2282 Vect(V ) is the degree in the variables \u03be i (as a filtration). We\nconclude that strict L\u221e -algebras of order > r are in a 1 \u2212 1-correspondence\nwith odd vector fields Q vanishing at the origin with the square Q2 of degree\n6 r in coordinates.\nExample 4.2. For a (super)manifold M , consider C \u221e (M ) \u2282 C \u221e (T \u2217 M ) as\nin Example 2.3. The projector is the pullback. Any odd Hamiltonian S \u2208\n\n\f10\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nC \u221e (T \u2217 M ) defines a sequence of higher Schouten (= odd Poisson) brackets\nin C \u221e (M ) by the formula\n{f1 , . . . , fn }S := (. . . ((S, f1 ), f2 ), . . . , fn )|p=0\n(the parentheses stand for the canonical Poisson bracket on T \u2217 M ). Here\nf1 , . . . , fn \u2208 C \u221e (M ). They satisfy the Jacobi identities of all orders if\n(S, S) = 0. Notice that a Hamiltonian has a finite order w.r.t. the subalgebra\nC \u221e (M ) if it is polynomial in pa , and the order is the respective degree. The\nJacobi identities can be obtained one by one by putting restrictions on the\norder of (S, S).

In this example each of the higher Schouten brackets is a\nmulti-derivation, i.e., satisfies the Leibniz rule w.r.t. the usual product, in\neach argument. Hence the algebras that we obtain are particular homotopy\nanalogs of odd Poisson (= Schouten, Gerstenhaber) algebras. The 'strict'\ncase is when S|p=0 = 0.\nExample 4.3. Similarly to the above, take as L the algebra of multivector\nfields C \u221e (\u03a0T \u2217 M ) with the canonical Schouten bracket. Here we have to\nchange parity to obtain a Lie superalgebra. The rest goes as in Example 4.2.\nAny even multivector field P \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a0T \u2217 M ) provides a sequence of higher\nPoisson brackets in C \u221e (M ):\n{f1 , . . . , fn }P := [[ . . .

As in Example 4.2, each of\nthe higher brackets strictly satisfies the Leibniz rule w.r.t. the product of\nfunctions.\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n11\n\nExamples 4.3 and 4.2 generalize classical Poisson and Schouten (= odd\nPoisson) structures, as Example 4.1 generalizes classical Lie algebras. Indeed, for a bivector field P = 21 P ab x\u2217b x\u2217a or an odd Hamiltonian quadratic\nin the momenta S = 12 S ab pb pa , the binary derived bracket is an ordinary\nPoisson or Schouten bracket, respectively, and all other brackets vanish.\n(Similarly, after the shift of parity the bracket in a Lie algebra is the binary\nderived bracket for a homological vector field Q = 21 \u03be i \u03be j Qkji \u2202k that is quadratic in coordinates.) A mechanism for the arising of higher brackets can\nbe to take a quadratic Hamiltonian or a bivector field generating an ordinary\nSchouten or Poisson bracket, and apply to it a canonical transformation that\nfixes the zero section but not the bundle structure.\nNotice in both examples the possibility of obtaining higher odd or even\nPoisson brackets from a non-polynomial Hamiltonian or multivector field\n(the latter is possible only in the super case). It is the Taylor expansion\naround the zero section M \u2282 T \u2217 M or M \u2282 \u03a0T \u2217 M that counts.\nExample 4.4. Consider a commutative associative algebra with a unit A,\ne.g., an algebra of smooth functions C \u221e (M ). Let L be the algebra of all\nlinear operators in A w.r.t. the commutator, and V = A considered as an\nAbelian subalgebra in L. Let P : End A \u2192 End A be the evaluation at 1,\nas in Example 2.2.

If \u2206 is a differential operator of order s, then the (s + 1)th bracket and all higher brackets identically vanish, and the s-th bracket\nis a (symmetric) multi-derivation of the algebra A. (It is nothing but the\n\n\f12\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\npolarization of the principal symbol of \u2206.) The usual order of a differential\noperator is exactly the 'order w.r.t. the subalgebra A'. The k-th bracket\nwith 1 6 k 6 s is in this case a differential operator of order s \u2212 k + 1 in each\nargument. One can view these brackets as consecutive \"polarizations\" of the\noperator \u2206. It is instructive to write them down explicitly for a particular\noperator \u2206 in a differential-geometric setting (see below). As follows from\nTheorem 1, if \u22062 = 0, then the derived brackets of \u2206 satisfy the Jacobi\nidentities of all orders; otherwise, by requiring ord \u22062 6 r we obtain the\nJacobi identities of orders r + 1 and higher.\nRemark 4.1. That the brackets (22) give an L\u221e -algebra if \u22062 = 0 was for\nthe first time proved in [9], by rather hard calculations.\nThe n-brackets (22) with n > 1 will not change if we replace \u2206 by\n\u2032n denote the n-th Jacobiator with \u03a6 dropped, and\n\u2206\u2032 = \u2206 \u2212 \u22061.

Applying TheoJ\u2206\n\u2206\n\u2206\u2032\nn and J \u2032n with the n-brackets generated by \u22062 and \u2206\u20322\nrem 1, we identify J\u2206\n\u2206\nrespectively. Since \u2206\u20322 = \u22062 \u2212[\u2206, \u22061], by comparing the orders we conclude\n\u2032n = J n for all n = s, s + 1, . . . , 2s \u2212 1 if ord \u2206 6 s. Hence \u03a6 = \u22061\nthat J\u2206\n\u2206\ncan be dropped from the n-th Jacobi identity for the brackets generated by\n\u2206 exactly for these numbers n.\nThe construction in Example 4.4 generalizes the interpretation of a classical odd Poisson bracket as the derived bracket of a 'generating operator'\nof second order (= an odd Laplacian, a 'BV-operator'). This approach\nwas particularly useful for the analysis of second order differential operators\nin [16, 17] (see also [18]).\nExample 4.5 ([16, 17]). If \u2206 is an odd 2-nd order differential operator in\nC \u221e (M ), in local coordinates\n\u2206 = R(x) + T a (x) \u2202a +\n\n1 ab\nS (x) \u2202b \u2202a ,\n2\n\nthen we get\n\u03a6 = \u22061 = R\n1 ab\nS \u2202b \u2202a f ,\n2\n \u0303\n{f, g}\u2206 = (\u22121)f \u00e3 S ab \u2202b f \u2202a g .\n{f }\u2206 = \u2206\u2032 = T a \u2202a f +\n\nAll the higher brackets vanish. Automatically ord \u22062 6 3. If ord \u22062 6 2,\nthen {f, g}\u2206 satisfies the usual Jacobi identity, making C \u221e (M ) into an\nodd Poisson algebra. If ord \u22062 6 1, then \u2206\u2032 is a derivation of the bracket.\nFinally, if ord \u22062 6 0 and \u22061 = 0, then \u2206 = \u2206\u2032 is a differential; the resulting\nalgebraic structure is known as a Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebra.

We have to impose \u22061 = 0 to get strictness back.\nRemark 4.2. The algebraic structure consisting of all higher derived brackets\nof an odd differential operator of order n and the usual multiplication, should\nbe considered an example of a homotopy Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebra (see [34,\n23, 33] and a discussion in Section 6).\nThe behaviour of the brackets in Example 4.2 and Example 4.4 w.r.t.\nthe multiplication, at the first glance seems very different. However, the\nidentities satisfied by the algebras obtained in Example 4.2 can be seen as the\n\"classical limit\" of the identities for the algebras obtained in Example 4.4.\n\n\f14\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nIndeed, if we redefine the brackets in Example 4.4 by inserting the \"Planck's\nconstant\" ~, as\n{f1 , . . . , fn }\u2206 := (\u2212i~)\u2212n [. . . [[\u2206, f1 ], f2 ], . . . , fn ](1) ,\nthen they will satisfy the same Jacobi-type identities as before, but the\n\"Leibniz identity\" will now read\n{f1 , . . . , fn\u22121 , gh}\u2206 = {f1 , . . . , fn\u22121 , g}\u2206 h + (\u22121)g\u0303 h\u0303 {f1 , . . . , fn\u22121 , h}\u2206 g\n+ (\u2212i~){f1 , . . . , fn\u22121 , g, h}\u2206 ,\nwhich clearly becomes the strict derivation property when ~ \u2192 0.\n5. Case of non-inner derivations\nHigher derived brackets generated by an element \u2206 naturally arise in applications, as we saw it in the previous section. However, from theoretical\nreasons and from the viewpoint of further generalizations it seems natural\nto look also into a possibility to obtain a similar construction from an arbitrary derivation of the superalgebra L rather than inner derivations given\nby \u2206 \u2208 L. It is indeed possible and in particular allows to look at higher\nderived brackets from yet another angle. Here we shall briefly outline the\nconstruction and statements, leaving a more detailed exposition for another\noccasion.\nAs above, let L be a Lie superalgebra and P a projector satisfying the\nidentities [P a, P b] = 0 and\nP [a, b] = P [P a, b] + P [a, P b]\nfor all a, b \u2208 L. Recall that it means that both subspaces V = ImP and\nK = Ker P are subalgebras and V is Abelian. Consider an arbitrary, even or\nodd, derivation d of the Lie superalgebra L. Let us assume that the kernel\nK of P is closed under d; this is equivalent to the identity\nP dP = P d .\n\n(23)\n\n(Notice that we do not assume the image of P , i.e., the subspace V , to be\nclosed under d.)\nDefinition 4. The n-th derived bracket of d is the following operation on\nthe subspace V \u2282 L:\n{a1 , . . . , an }d := P [. . . [da1 , a2 ], . . . , an ] ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere ai \u2208 V . Here n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\nRemark. If V happens to be closed under d, then all the n-brackets (24)\nwith n > 1, will vanish. So it is the non-commutativity of d with P that is\nthe source of higher derived brackets.\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n15\n\nBrackets (24) are even or odd depending on the parity of d. Notice that\nthere is no 0-ary bracket, differently from the construction based on \u2206 \u2208 L.\nExactly as above follows (from the derivation property of d, the Jacobi\nidentity in L and the condition that the subalgebra V \u2282 L is Abelian) that\nall higher brackets (24) are symmetric in the Z2 -graded sense.\nTheorem 2. Suppose d is an odd derivation. Then the n-th Jacobiator of\nthe derived brackets of d is exactly the n-th derived bracket of d2 :\nJdn (a1 , . . . , an ) = {a1 , . . . , an }d2 .\n\n(25)\n\nHere n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . (In the formula for the Jacobiator the 0-th bracket\nshould be set to zero.)\nIn particular, if d2 = 0, the higher derived brackets of d make the subspace\nV a strict L\u221e -algebra. Clearly, it is also possible to weaken the condition\nd2 = 0 by considering instead of it a filtration by an 'order' of operators\nw.r.t. the subspace V , as we did above for \u2206.\nTheorem 2 is a generalization of Theorem 1 if P (\u2206) = 0. As we have seen\nit in the examples, this not always the case, so better to consider these two\nstatements as independent, though closely related.\nThe construction of higher derived brackets from an arbitrary derivation\nmakes it possible to give for them a nice homotopy-theoretic interpretation,\nas follows1. Let d be an odd derivation of the superalgebra Lie L such that\nd2 = 0. So L together with d is a differential Lie superalgebra. Consider the\nsubalgebra K = Ker P in L. It is a differential subalgebra. Consider the\ninclusion map i : K \u2192 L. Forget for a moment about the algebra structure\nand consider it just as an inclusion of complexes. (For our purposes, a complex is a Z2 -graded vector space with an odd endomorphism of square zero.)\nAs topologists know, \"every map can be made a fibration\", by applying a\ncocylinder construction. The fiber of this fibration is known as a 'homotopy fiber' of the original map. What is a homotopy fiber for the inclusion\ni : K \u2192 L? The claim is, it is the space \u03a0V . Moreover, the higher derived\nbrackets will make it a homotopy fiber in the category of L\u221e -algebras. More\nprecisely, the following statements hold.\nLet i : K \u2192 L be an arbitrary inclusion of complexes such that there is\ngiven a complementary subspace V \u2282 L for K, so that L = K \u2295 V . (V is\nnot necessarily a subcomplex.) Let P be the projector onto V parallel to K.\nThe space V becomes a complex with the differential P d. Introduce into\nL \u2295 \u03a0V an operator D as follows:\n\u0001\nD(x, \u03a0a) := dx, \u2212\u03a0P (x + da) ,\n(26)\nfor x \u2208 L, a \u2208 V . Then D 2 = 0 (check!). Consider the maps j : K \u2192 L\u2295\u03a0V\nand p : L \u2295 \u03a0V \u2192 L, where j : x 7\u2192 (x, 0), p : (x, \u03a0a) 7\u2192 x.\n1A\n\nhomotopy-theoretic interpretation of our original construction with \u2206 was\nconjectured by an anonymous referee of this paper, who proposed to extend the\nbrackets generated by \u2206 by formulae similar to (29)\u2013(35) deduced below.\n\n\f16\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nLemma 1. The diagram\ni\n\n\u2732 L\n\n\u2732\n\nK\n\nj\n\np\n\n(27)\n\n\u2732\n\nL \u2295 \u03a0V\nis a cocylinder diagram in the category of complexes, i.e., the maps j and p\nare chain maps, i = p \u25e6 j, the map j : K \u2192 L \u2295 \u03a0V is a monomorphism\n('cofibration') and a quasi-isomorphism ('weak homotopy equivalence'), and\nthe map p : L \u2295 \u03a0V \u2192 L is an epimorphism ('fibration').\n(A quasi-inverse for j is q : (x, \u03a0a) 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 P )(x + da).)\nIt follows that \u03a0V = Ker p taken with the differential \u2212\u03a0P d is a homotopy fiber or a co-cone of the inclusion of complexes i : K \u2192 L = K \u2295 V .\nNow, if we come back to our original setup where i : K \u2192 L is an inclusion\nof differential Lie superalgebras, we want to provide the cocylinder L \u2295 \u03a0V\nwith a bracket extending the one in L so that j and p will respect the\nbrackets and D be a derivation. It turns out that this condition fixes the\nbracket in L \u2295 \u03a0V uniquely. In addition to the original Lie bracket in L,\nappear new brackets between elements of L and \u03a0V , and inside \u03a0V :\n[x, \u03a0a] := (\u22121)x\u0303 \u03a0P [x, a],\n\n[\u03a0a, \u03a0b] := (\u22121)\u00e3+1 \u03a0P [da, b]\n\nUp to the parity shift, the latter bracket is immediately recognizable as\nthe beginning of our sequence of higher derived brackets generated by d in\nV . The new binary bracket in L \u2295 \u03a0V does not satisfy the Jacobi identity\nexactly; this gives rise to ternary brackets L \u2295 \u03a0V of the form similar to the\nabove, and so on. One can figure out the appearance of these higher brackets\nby an incomplete induction. Since in this paper we work with symmetric\nbrackets, the final result is more conveniently formulated after a parity shift.\nApplying \u03a0 to (27) we get\ni\n\n\u2732 \u03a0L\n\nj\n\np\n\n\u2732\n\n\u03a0K\n\n(28)\n\n\u2732\n\n\u03a0L \u2295 V\nwhich is a cocylinder diagram for i = i\u03a0 : \u03a0K \u2192 \u03a0L in the category\nof\n\u0001\ncomplexes. Here D = D \u03a0 in \u03a0L \u2295 V is (\u03a0x, a) 7\u2192 \u2212\u03a0dx, P (x + da) . The\ndesire to extend the bracket in \u03a0L corresponding to the Lie bracket in L\nkeeping D a derivation, naturally leads to the following definitions. The\n0-ary bracket in \u03a0L \u2295 V is set to zero and as the unary bracket we take the\noperator D:\n{\u03a0x} = \u2212\u03a0dx + P x,\n{a} = P da .\n\n(29)\n(30)\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n17\n\nThen we define the binary brackets as\n{\u03a0x, \u03a0y} = \u03a0[x, y](\u22121)x\u0303 ,\n{\u03a0x, a} = P [x, a],\n{a, b} = P [da, b].\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n\nThe higher order brackets we define as\n{\u03a0x, a1 , . . . , an } = P [. . . [x, a1 ], . . . , an ],\n{a1 , . . . , an } = P [. . . [da1 , a2 ], . . . , an ],\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nwhere n > 1. All the other brackets except obtainable from these by symmetry, are set to zero. We arrive at a collection of odd symmetric multilinear\noperations on \u03a0L \u2295 V . The subspace V is an ideal w.r.t. these operations\nand their restriction to V coincides with the higher derived brackets (24).\nTheorem 3. The operations (29)\u2013(35) make the space \u03a0L \u2295 V a strict\nL\u221e -algebra.\nIt follows from Theorem 3 that the diagram (28) is a cocylinder diagram\nin the category of L\u221e -algebras, as it is clear that the maps j and p in (28)\nstrictly respect the brackets, in particular giving L\u221e -maps. As a corollary\nwe see that V considered with the higher derived brackets (24) is a homotopy\nfiber of the inclusion of the (odd) differential Lie superalgebras \u03a0K \u2192 \u03a0L.\nIf we change the viewpoint at L\u221e -algebras and adopt a definition which\ndiffers from ours by the parity shift (see Remark 2.1), it will be possible to\nsay that \u03a0V (with the corresponding 'shifted' higher derived brackets) is a\nhomotopy fiber for the inclusion K \u2192 L.\nThe proofs of Theorems 2 and 3, and other details, will be given elsewhere.\n6. Discussion\nA derived bracket (with this name) of two arguments appeared for the\nfirst time in the paper by Y. Kosmann-Schwarzbach [20], who also referred\nto an unpublished text by Koszul of 1990. She proved that any odd derivation of a Loday (= Leibniz) algebra generates a new Loday bracket of the\nopposite parity by the formula [a, b]D = (\u22121)\u00e3 [Da, b]. (The present author independently introduced a derived bracket around 1993 and proved\na similar statement, in a slightly less generality than [20], namely, without the Loday algebras and working only with Lie superalgebras.) Unlike\nthe brackets introduced in the present paper, the bracket [a, b]D does not\nnecessarily satisfy (anti)symmetry even if the original bracket does. Antisymmetry is restored on suitable subspaces or quotient spaces provided the\nderived bracket can be restricted there. The present construction of higher\nderived brackets making use of a projector P solves the problem by forcing\nthe bracket to remain in a given subspace. The necessity to consider all the\nhigher brackets, not just the binary bracket, is the price.\n\n\f18\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nRetrospectively, binary derived brackets, considered on subspaces, can\nbe recognized in many constructions of differential geometry, e.g., in the\nCartan identities [d, iu ] = Lu , [Lu , iv ] = i[u,v] combined to give i[u,v] =\n[iu , [d, iv ]]. An important example is the coordinate-free expression for a\nPoisson bracket generated by a bivector field B via the canonical Schouten\nbracket: {f, g}B = [[f, [[B, g]]]] up to a sign depending on conventions, and a\nsimilar expression for a Schouten structure via the canonical Poisson bracket.\n(For the author, these expressions were a starting point in the discovery of\nderived brackets.) Derived brackets have been also used for describing Lie\nalgebroids (see, e.g., [35]) and Courant algebroids [30, 28].\nHigher brackets do not appear in these classical examples because for\nthem the generating element is always, loosely speaking, 'quadratic': viz.,\na quadratic homological vector field Q = 12 \u03be i \u03be j Qkji \u2202k , a bivector field B =\n1 ab\n1 ab\n\u2217 \u2217\n2 B (x)xb xa , a quadratic Hamiltonian S = 2 S (x)pb pa , an odd Laplacian\n\u2206, etc. For the same reason there is no need to introduce a projector to\nremain in a chosen subspace of the 'zero-order' elements (such as vector fields\nwith constant coefficients, functions on M as opposed to those on T \u2217 M , zeroorder operators, etc.). On the other hand, a natural attempt to replace, say,\na Poisson bivector field by an arbitrary multivector field satisfying [[P, P ]] = 0\nand still have a bracket on functions, requires introducing a projector and\nimmediately leads to higher derived brackets and homotopy analogs of the\nclassical examples. (See Example 4.2 and other examples in the previous\nsection.)\nThe characterization of differential operators with the help of multiple\ncommutators can be traced to Grothendieck [10]. Related to it the higher\nderived brackets of Example 4.4 essentially coincide with the operations \u03a6r\nintroduced by Koszul in [22]. For a differential operator \u2206 on a graded\ncommutative algebra, Koszul defined \u03a6r\u2206 for r > 0 as\n\u03a6r\u2206 (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ar ) := m \u25e6 (\u2206 \u2297 id) \u03bbr (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ar )\nwhere \u03bbr (a1 \u2297. . .\u2297ar ) = (a1 \u22971\u22121\u2297a1 ) . . . (ar \u22971\u22121\u2297ar ) and m stands for\nequals the failure of the\nthe multiplication; he stated that for each r, \u03a6r+1\n\u2206\nLeibniz identity for \u03a6r\u2206 . He was basically interested in the binary operation\n\u03a62\u2206 generated by an odd operator of second order. It was stated in [22] that\nthe failure of the homotopy Jacobi identity for \u03a62\u2206 (involving \u03a63\u2206 ) equaled\n\u03a63\u22062 , and that the Leibniz identity for \u2206 and \u03a62\u2206 were equivalent to \u03a62\u22062 = 0.\nGeneralizations of Koszul's operations \u03a6r for various types of algebras, not\nnecessarily commutative or associative were studied by F. Akman [1] (see\nalso [2]). As in [22], she was mainly concerned with the binary bracket \u03a62 .\n\"Higher antibrackets\" generated by an odd differential operator \u2206, together with higher Poisson brackets, have appeared in the series of physical\npapers [3, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] motivated by a development of the Batalin\u2013\nVilkovisky quantization. As Stasheff noted, they were also hiding in works\non Batalin\u2013Fradkin\u2013Vilkovisky formalism, such as [19]. In [9] it was proved\ndirectly that the higher brackets defined by (22) form an L\u221e -algebra if\n\n\fHIGHER DERIVED BRACKETS\n\n19\n\n\u22062 = 0. For \"general antibrackets\" on differential operators defined in [8]\nas the symmetrizations of multiple commutators\n[. . . [[\u2206, A1 ], A2 ], . . . , An ]\n(no evaluation at 1, unlike (22)), where the operators Ai are arbitrary and do\nnot have to belong to an Abelian subalgebra, were obtained certain Jacobitype identities more complicated than those for the L\u221e -algebras. Such algebraic structures are yet to be analyzed.\nAs we mentioned in Section 4, higher derived brackets of Example 4.4\nmake the natural framework for the problem of describing the generating\noperators of an odd bracket. Geometric constructions related with these\n'Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky operators' were considered in [11], [32], [21], [13, 14, 15].\nA complete picture was obtained in [16, 17]. In [17], H. Khudaverdian and\nthe author established a one-to-one correspondence between second-order\ndifferential operators on the algebra of densities V(M ) on a supermanifold\nM and binary brackets in V(M ). For operators acting on functions, this\nspecializes to a correspondence between operators and pairs consisting of a\nbracket on functions and an \"upper connection\" on volume forms [17]. For\nodd operators this gives a description of the Jacobi conditions in terms of\nthis connection. Constructions of the present paper, hopefully, can be useful\nfor generalizing the results of [17] to higher order operators.\nThere were suggested different approaches to Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebras \"up to homotopy\", as well as to homotopy Schouten (= Gerstenhaber)\nalgebras. Operadic approaches to the latter are discussed in [34]. A direct definition of a homotopy Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebra was suggested\nby Olga Kravchenko [23] and further generalized by Tamarkin and Tsygan [33]. In particular, besides the L\u221e -structure this definition provides for\nthe (strong) homotopy associativity of the product and homotopy Leibniz\nidentities. The examples in Section 4 satisfy much stricter conditions. On\nthe other hand, an example of higher brackets of differential operators as\nin [8] involves conditions that are weaker than those of an L\u221e -structure.\nTherefore the final algebraic framework for these notions is yet to be found.\nThe higher derived brackets that we introduced here are not the most\ngeneral. A natural extension of our constructions should be to allow the\nimage of a projector P to be an arbitrary Lie subalgebra, not necessarily\nAbelian. A condition generalizing (2) should then read\nP [a, b] = P [P a, b] + P [a, P b] \u2212 [P a, P b].\n\n(36)\n\n(Together with P [P a, P b] = [P a, P b] that means that both ImP and Ker P\nare subalgebras, i.e., the Lie superalgebra in question is the sum of two\nsubalgebras.) In such case the symmetry of higher derived brackets should\nremain only up to homotopy, and we should end up with a yet more general notion of a (strongly) homotopy Lie algebra. In examples, this should\nlead also to more general cases of homotopy Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebras.\nFor instance, when P = id, this should cover the \"general antibrackets\"\n\n\f20\n\nTHEODORE VORONOV\n\nof [8]. Projectors satisfying (36) appeared in [12] with a totally different\nmotivation. It was shown, remarkably, that they come from operators on\nan associative algebra with a unit satisfying\nP 1 = 1,\n\nP (aP b) = P (ab),\n\nP ((P a)b) = P a P b.\n\n(37)\n\nKhudaverdian's result [12] is that upon conditions (37), the formal series\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\na\nlog(P e ) = log 1 + P a + P (a ) + . . .\n2\nfor any element a of the associative algebra can be expressed via commutators only and the action of P , thus obtaining a generalization of the Baker\u2013\nCampbell\u2013Hausdorff formula. (These results were inspired by an analysis\nof certain Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory. Examples, however,\nrange to cobordism theory and Novikov's operator doubles [12].) There\nmust be a connection with the present construction of higher derived brackets, but it is yet to be understood. A question that is related, is to give\nan analogous \"derived\" construction in the associative setting, leading to\nA\u221e -algebras and their relatives.\nAnother interesting direction of study should be derived brackets and\nhomotopy algebras arising from graded manifolds [35] (see also [29]).\nWe hope to consider these questions elsewhere.\nReferences\n[1] F.
