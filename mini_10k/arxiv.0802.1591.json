Let A be a semiprime 2 and 3-torsion free non-commutative associative algebra. We show that the Lie algebra Der(A) of (associative) derivations of A is strongly nondegenerate, which is a strong form of semiprimeness for Lie algebras, under some additional\nrestrictions on the center of A. This result follows from a description of the quadratic annihilator of a general Lie algebra inside appropriate Lie overalgebras. Similar results are obtained\nfor an associative algebra A with involution and the Lie algebra SDer(A) of involution preserving derivations of A.\n\nIntroduction\nThis paper is concerned with the structure of the Lie algebra Der(A) of associative derivations of an associative algebra A, which we will also assume to be 2 and 3-torsion free. It was\nproved in [10, Theorem 4 and Theorem 2] that if A is semiprime (respectively prime) then\nDer(A) is a semiprime (respectively, prime) Lie algebra. We prove below that, if A is prime,\nthis result can be strengthened to show that in fact Der(A) is strongly non-degenerate (see\nbelow for the precise definitions).\nThe key result in the paper is Theorem 2.1 and has a technical flavour. Let L be a subalgebra\nof a Lie algebra Q. The quadratic annihilator of L inside Q is defined as the set {q \u2208\nQ | [q, [q, L]] = 0}. Roughly speaking, Theorem 2.1 allows to obtain non-zero elements in the\nquadratic annihilator of L in itself from non-zero elements in the quadratic annihilator of L\ninside Q whenever Q is a weak quotient algebra of L, i.e., [L, q] 6= 0 for every non-zero q \u2208 Q.\nIf L is strongly non-degenerate, then the quadratic annihilator of L inside Q coincides with\nthe annihilator of L in Q, and both are zero (Theorem 2.2 (ii)).\nAnother application of Theorem 2.1 leads to the proof of the fact that, if a Lie algebra\nL contains an essential ideal which is strongly non-degenerate, then the algebra L is itself\nstrongly non-degenerate (Proposition 2.3 (ii)). This fact was already proved by Zelmanov in\n[17] by making use of the Kostrikin radical, while our proof is based on elements.\nAccording to the above, and in order to obtain the result announced in the abstract (Theorem 2.5) we need to produce an essential ideal inside Der(A) which is strongly non-degenerate.\nThe natural candidate for this is the ideal Inn(A) of the so-called inner derivations of A, which\ncan be identified with the quotient A/Z(A), known to be strongly non-degenerate under appropriate mild hypotheses. However, this ideal might fail to be essential, and this is somehow\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 17B60, 16W25.\nKey words and phrases.

Our result\nthen asserts that Der(A)/IZ is strongly non-degenerate. In the particular case that the center\nZ(A) of A does not contain associative ideals (e.g. if A is prime), one has that IZ = 0, and\nthen we do obtain that Der(A) is strongly non-degenerate.\nOur arguments can be subsequently adjusted with some extra effort to the case of a \u2217semiprime algebra A and the Lie algebra SDer(A) of those (associative) derivations of A that\ncommute with the involution, that is, those \u03b4 \u2208 Der(A) such that \u03b4(a\u2217 ) = (\u03b4(a))\u2217 for every\na \u2208 A (Theorem 2.8).\n1. Notation and preliminaries\nLet \u03a6 be a unital commutative ring. All algebras in this paper, associative or not, will be\n\u03a6-modules. Recall that a Lie algebra over \u03a6 is a \u03a6-module L, together with a bilinear map\n[ , ] : L \u00d7 L \u2192 L, denoted by (x, y) 7\u2192 [x, y] and called the bracket of x and y such that the\nfollowing axioms are satisfied:\n(i) [x, x] = 0,\n(ii) [x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0 (Jacobi identity),\nfor every x, y, z in L.\nThe standard example is obtained by considering a (non-necessary unital) associative algebra A, with its same module structure and bracket given by [x, y] = xy \u2212 yx. Sometimes the\nnotation A\u2212 is used in order to emphasize the Lie structure of A.\nGiven an element x of a Lie algebra L, we may define a map ad x : L \u2192 L by ad x(y) = [x, y]\n(which is a derivation of the Lie algebra L). We shall denote by A(L) the associative subalgebra\n(possibly without identity) of End(L) generated by the elements ad x for x in L.\nAn element x in a Lie algebra L is an absolute zero divisor if (ad x)2 = 0. This is equivalent\nto saying that [x, [x, L]] = 0. The algebra L is said to be strongly non-degenerate (according\nto Kostrikin) if it does not contain non-zero absolute zero divisors.\nGiven a Lie algebra L, we say that L is semiprime if we have I 2 6= 0 whenever I is a\nnon-zero ideal. It is obvious from the definitions that strongly non-degenerate Lie algebras\nare semiprime, but the converse does not hold (see [15, Remark 1.1])\nNext, L is said to be prime if [I, J] 6= 0 for any pair of non-zero ideals I, J of L. An ideal I\nof L is said to be essential if its intersection with any non-zero ideal is again a non-zero ideal.\nFor two subsets X, Y of a (Lie) algebra L we define the annihilator of Y in X as the set\nAnnX (Y ) := {x \u2208 X | [x, Y ] = 0} ,\nand the quadratic annihilator of Y in X to be the set\nQAnnX (Y ) := {x \u2208 X | [x, [x, Y ]] = 0} .\nWhen X = L, we write Ann(Y ) or AnnL (Y ) (if no confusion may arise) and refer to it as\nthe annihilator of Y . If X = Y = L, then Ann(L) is called the centre of L and usually denoted\nby Z(L). In the case that L = A\u2212 for an associative algebra A, then Z(A\u2212 ) agrees with the\nassociative center Z of A. It is easy to check (by using the Jacobi identity) that Ann(X) is\nan ideal of L whenever X is an ideal of L. Therefore, for A associative we can form the Lie\nalgebra A\u2212 /Z. We will be primarily interested in this type of Lie algebras, and in Lie algebras\n\n\fSTRONGLY NON-DEGENERATE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nthat arise from associative algebras with involution. If A is associative and has an involution\n\u2217, then the set of its skew elements\nK = KA = {x \u2208 A | x\u2217 = \u2212x}\nis a subalgebra of A\u2212 . The center Z(K) of the Lie algebra K will be for brevity denoted by\nZK , and we will be interested in the Lie algebra K/ZK .\nThe notion of the quadratic annihilator of an (arbitrary) algebra \u2013 defined in a similar\nway as we have done for Lie algebras \u2013 plays an important role: see, for example, Smirnov's\npaper [16]. Let us remark here that the quadratic annihilator need not be closed under sums\nin the case of an associative product (for an example, see [16]). The same phenomenon occurs\nin the Lie context, as is shown in the examples below.\nExamples 1.1. (1) Let F be any field and let L = t(3, F ) be the Lie algebra of upper\ntriangular matrices (see, e.g. [8]). Then QAnn(L) = {a(e11 + e22 + e33 ) + be13 + ce23 | a, b, c \u2208\nF } \u222a {a(e11 + e22 + e33 ) + be12 + ce13 | a, b, c \u2208 F }, where, as usual, eij denotes the matrix in\nM3 (F ) whose entries are all zero except for the one in row i and column j. Then QAnn(L) is\nnot closed under sums.\n(2) Now, for L as in (1), consider the Lie algebra L := L/Z. Then\nQAnn(L) = {ae13 + be23 | a, b \u2208 F } \u222a {ae12 + be13 | a, b \u2208 F } ,\nwhere x denotes the class of an element x in L. Again we have that the quadratic annihilator\nof this algebra L is not closed under sums.\nLet L \u2286 Q be Lie algebras. When 0 6= [L, q] \u2286 L for every non-zero q \u2208 Q we say that\nQ is a weak algebra of quotients of L (see [15]). The notion of algebra of quotients of an\nalgebra (associative or not necessarily associative) has a long history and is an active research\narea, specially in recent years, following its development in the Lie and Jordan contexts. In\nthe seminal paper [15] the second author initiated the study of algebras of quotients of Lie\nalgebras, by adapting some ideas from the associative and also Jordan ([13]) contexts. She\nintroduced the notion of a general (abstract) algebra of quotients of a Lie algebra, and also\nthe notion of the maximal algebra of quotients Qm (L) of a semiprime Lie algebra L. Follow\nup results can be found in [14, 4, 2].\nLet B be a subalgebra of an associative algebra A. A linear map \u03b4 : B \u2192 A is called a\nderivation if \u03b4(xy) = \u03b4(x)y + x\u03b4(y) for all x, y \u2208 B. By a derivation of A we simply mean a\nderivation from A into A. Let Der(A) denote the set of all derivations of A. It is clear that\nDer(A) becomes a \u03a6-module under natural operations and it also becomes a Lie algebra by\nputting [\u03b4, \u03bc] = \u03b4\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\u03b4, for every \u03b4, \u03bc in Der(A). Any element x of A determines a map\nad x : A \u2192 A defined by ad x(y) = [x, y], which is a derivation of A. For every Lie ideal U of\nA, the restriction of the map ad : A \u2192 Der(A) to U ,\nU\ny\n\n\u2192 Der(A)\n7\n\u2192\nad y\n\ndefines a Lie algebra homomorphism with kernel AnnU (A), which allows us to identify U/AnnU (A)\nwith the subalgebra ad (U ) of Der(A). For any y \u2208 U and \u03b4 \u2208 Der(A), [\u03b4, ad y] = ad \u03b4(y),\nhence ad (U ) is an ideal of Der(A) whenever \u03b4(U ) \u2286 U for every \u03b4 \u2208 Der(A). The ideal ad (A)\nof Der(A) is usually denoted by Inn(A) and its elements are called inner derivations of A.\nNote that A\u2212 /Z \u223c\n= Inn(A).\n\n\f4\n\nFRANCESC PERERA & MERCEDES SILES MOLINA\n\nNow let A be an associative algebra with involution \u2217. The set\nSDer(A) = {\u03b4 \u2208 Der(A) | \u03b4(x\u2217 ) = \u03b4(x)\u2217 for all x \u2208 A}\nis a Lie subalgebra of Der(A). Denote by ad (K) the set of Lie derivations ad x : A \u2192 A with\nx in K.\nIn what follows we will assume that 2 and 3 are invertible elements in \u03a6.\n2. The results\nBy an extension of Lie algebras L \u2286 Q we will mean that L is a (Lie) subalgebra of the\nLie algebra Q. Let L \u2286 Q be an extension of Lie algebras and let AQ (L) be the associative\nsubalgebra of A(Q) generated by {ad x : x \u2208 L}.\nFor an extension L \u2286 Q of Lie algebras, the condition that AnnL (Q) = 0 ensures that the\nmap L \u2192 A(Q) given by x 7\u2192 ad x is a monomorphism of Lie algebras. Examples of extensions\nwhere AnnL (Q) = 0 are the dense ones (see [3] for the definition of a dense extension and [14]\nfor examples).\nTheorem 2.1. Let L \u2286 Q be an extension of Lie algebras such that the map x 7\u2192 ad x from\nL \u2192 A(Q) is a monomorphism of Lie algebras. Let a \u2208 QAnnQ (L). Then, for each u \u2208 L\nsatisfying x := [a, u] \u2208 L, we have that z := [x, [x, v]] is in QAnnL (L), for every v \u2208 L.\nProof. In order to ease the notation in our computations, we shall temporarily get rid of\nthe prefix ad and use capital letters X, Y , etc. instead of ad x, ad y, etc. Because of our\nassumption, we shall also identify an element x of L with its corresponding operator X = ad x\nin A(Q). An equation involving commutators on L is then translated into the corresponding\nequation with capital letters and commutators in A(Q).\nLet a be in QAnnQ (L). Then\n(2.1)\n\n[a, [a, y]] = 0 for every y \u2208 L .\n\nThis implies [A, [A, Y ]] = 0 for every Y \u2208 ad (L) \u2286 A(Q), hence\nA2 Y + Y A2 \u2212 2AY A = 0 for every Y \u2208 ad (L) .\n\n(2.2)\nBy (2.1) we have\n\nA2 = 0 on L ,\n\n(2.3)\nand by (2.2) and\n(2.4)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2208 \u03a6,\nAY A = 0 on L, for every Y \u2208 ad (L).\n\nFor x = [a, u] \u2208 L, with u \u2208 L, we have that\n(2.5)\n\nX 2 = (AU \u2212 U A)2 = AU AU \u2212 AU 2 A \u2212 U A2 U + U AU A = \u2212AU 2 A\n\non L, by using (2.3) and (2.4).\n(2.5)\nNote that X 3 = (\u2212AU 2 A)(AU \u2212 U A) = \u2212AU 2 A2 U + AU 2 AU A = 0 by (2.3) and (2.4).\nThus:\n\n\fSTRONGLY NON-DEGENERATE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nX 3 = 0 on L .\n\n(2.6)\n\nWe may now apply [11, Lemma 1.5.6] in order to obtain:\n(2.7)\n\nXY X 2 = X 2 Y X on L, for every Y \u2208 ad (L) , and\n\n(2.8)\n\n(Y X 2 )2 = X 2 Y 2 X 2 on L, for every Y \u2208 ad (L) .\n\nNow,\nX 2 Y 2 X 2 = (Y X 2 )2 (by (2.8))\n= Y X 2Y X 2\n\n(2.9)\n\n= Y (XY X 2 )X (by (2.7))\n= 0 (by (2.6))\n\nTaking z := [x, [x, v]], with v \u2208 L, we compute that, on L,\nZ 2 = (X 2 V + V X 2 \u2212 2XV X)(X 2 V + V X 2 \u2212 2XV X)\n= X 2 V X 2 V + V X 4 V \u2212 2XV X 3 V\n+ X 2 V 2 X 2 + V X 2 V X 2 \u2212 2XV XV X 2\n\u2212 2X 2 V XV X \u2212 2V X 3 V X + 4XV X 2 V X\n= X 2V X 2V + V X 2V X 2\n\u2212 2XV (XV X 2 ) \u2212 2(X 2 V X)V X + 4XV X 2 V X (by (2.9) with Y = V and (2.6))\n= X 2 V X 2 V + V X 2 V X 2 (by (2.7) twice with Y = V )\n= X 2 V X 2 V (by (2.9) with Y = V )\n= (X 2 V X)XV = (XV X 2 )XV (by (2.7) with Y = V )\n= 0 , (by (2.6))\nwhich completes the proof of the theorem.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.2. Let L \u2286 Q be an extension of Lie algebras with Q a weak algebra of quotients\nof L and L strongly non-degenerate. Then:\n(i) Q is strongly non-degenerate ([15, Proposition 2.7(iii)]).\n(ii) AnnQ (L) = QAnnQ (L) = 0.\nProof. (i). Suppose that there exists a non-zero element a \u2208 QAnnQ (Q), and choose u \u2208 L\nsatisfying 0 6= x := [a, u] \u2208 L. Since L is strongly non-degenerate, z := [x, [x, v]] 6= 0 for some\nv \u2208 L. But, by Theorem 2.1, z must be zero, a contradiction.\n(ii). AnnQ (L) = 0 because Q is a weak algebra of quotients of L. For a \u2208 QAnnQ (L),\nz := [x, [x, v]] \u2208 QAnnL (L) whenever x := [a, u] \u2208 L, with u \u2208 L (Theorem 2.1). Now L being\n\n\f6\n\nFRANCESC PERERA & MERCEDES SILES MOLINA\n\nstrongly non-degenerete implies QAnnL (L) = 0, whence x is zero. Since Q is a weak algebra\nof quotients of L, we obtain that a = 0.\n\u0003\nCondition (ii) in the result below was proved by Zelmanov in [17, Corollary 2 in pg. 543] for\nstrongly non-degenerate Lie algebras by using the Kostrikin radical. Our proof here is based\non elements.\nProposition 2.3. Let I be a strongly non-degenerate ideal of a Lie algebra L. Then:\n(i) AnnL (I) = QAnnL (I).\n(ii) If AnnL (I) = 0, then the algebra L is strongly non-degenerate.\nProof. (i). Clearly, AnnL (I) \u2286 QAnnL (I). Conversely, consider a \u2208 QAnnL (I). The strongly\nnon-degeneracy assumption on I implies that the map I \u2192 A(L) given by y 7\u2192 ad y is a\nmonomorphism of Lie algebras. Since I is a strongly non-degenerate ideal of L, Theorem 2.1\nimplies that for every u \u2208 I, the element x = [a, u] is in QAnnI (I) = 0, hence a \u2208 AnnL (I).\n(ii). In this case we have that L is a weak algebra of quotients of I. Apply Theorem 2.2 to\nobtain that L must be strongly non-degenerate too.\n\u0003\nIf A is an associative algebra, and since every derivation maps Z to Z, the set\nIZ = {\u03b4 \u2208 Der(A) | \u03b4(A) \u2286 Z}\nis easily seen to be a Lie ideal of Der(A) that contains the center of Der(A). Indeed, for every\n\u03b4 \u2208 Z(Der(A)) and each a \u2208 A, we have that 0 = [\u03b4, ad a] = ad (\u03b4(a)), hence \u03b4(a) \u2208 Z.\nMoreover, under certain conditions, Inn(A) can be seen as an essential ideal of Der(A)/IZ .\nLemma 2.4. Let A be a semiprime non-commutative associative algebra. Then:\n(i) Inn(A) is (isomorphic to) an essential ideal of Der(A)/IZ , where IZ is defined as before.\n(ii) If Z does not contain non-zero associative ideals (in particular, if A is prime), then\nIZ = 0.\nProof. (i). The map\nInn(A) \u2192 Der(A)/IZ\nad a\nad a 7\u2192\nis a monomorphism of Lie algebras. This follows from the following fact:\n(\u2020)\n\n[[a, A], A] = 0 , with a \u2208 A, implies a \u2208 Z .\n\nIndeed, [[a, A], A] = 0 implies, by [6, Sublemma in pg. 5], [a, A] = 0, that is, ad a = 0.\nThis allows us to identify Inn(A) with its image inside Der(A)/IZ . The formula [\u03b4, ad a] =\nad \u03b4(a), where a \u2208 A and \u03b4 \u2208 Der(A) ensures that Inn(A) is indeed an ideal of Der(A)/IZ .\nNow let J/IZ be a non-zero ideal of Der(A) and consider \u03b4 \u2208 J \\ IZ , that is, [\u03b4(A), A] 6= 0.\nA second usage of (\u2020) allows us to conclude that [[\u03b4(A), A], A] 6= 0. Take a in A such that\n[\u03b4(a), A] 6\u2286 Z. Then 0 6= [\u03b4, ad a] = ad \u03b4(a), and thus Inn(A) is essential in Der(A)/IZ .\n(ii). Take \u03b4 \u2208 IZ and d \u2208 Der(A). Put \u03bc = [\u03b4, d]. For every pair of elements a, b \u2208 A we\nhave \u03bc([a, b]) = [\u03bc(a), b]+[a, \u03bc(b)]. Note that [\u03bc(a), b] = [\u03b4d(a), b]\u2212[d\u03b4(a), b] = \u2212[d\u03b4(a), b] = 0,\nbecause d(Z) \u2286 Z, and analogously [a, \u03bc(b)] = 0. It follows from this that \u03bc([A, A]) = 0.\nNow let I be a non-central Lie ideal of A, and take y in I \\ Z. Then [y, A] 6= 0 and by (\u2020),\nwe get 0 6= [[y, A], A] \u2286 I \u2229 [A, A]. Thus [A, A] intersects non-trivially every non-central Lie\nideal of A.\n\n\fSTRONGLY NON-DEGENERATE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nWe claim that the subalgebra h[A, A]i generated by [A, A] contains an essential associative\nideal of A. Herstein's [7, Theorem 3] implies that h[A, A]i contains a non-zero associative\nideal. By Zorn's Lemma, it is possible to find M maximal among all the associative ideals\ncontained in h[A, A]i. If Ann(M ) were non-zero, we get by what we have just proved that\nAnn(M ) \u2229 [A, A] 6= 0. Again by [7, Theorem 3], and since Z does not contain non-zero\nassociative ideals, we have that hAnn(M ) \u2229 [A, A]i contains a non-zero associative ideal J.\nNotice that J is not contained in M , since otherwise J \u2286 M \u2229 Ann(M ), which is zero because\nM is non-zero and A is semiprime. Then M \u2295 J \u2286 M \u2295 Ann(M ) \u2229 h[A, A]i and M ( M \u2295 J,\nwhich contradicts the maximality of M .\nBy the first part of the proof we have \u03bc([A, A]) = 0, and so \u03bc(I) = 0, where I is an\nessential ideal of A contained in h[A, A]i. This implies that \u03bc = 0. For, if \u03bc(a) 6= 0 for some\na \u2208 A, then the essentiality of I implies that there exists y \u2208 I such that y\u03bc(a) 6= 0. But\ny\u03bc(a) = \u03bc(ya) \u2212 \u03bc(y)a = 0, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.5. Let A be a semiprime non-commutative associative algebra. Then:\n(i) Der(A)/IZ is a strongly non-degenerate Lie algebra.\n(ii) If Z does not contain non-zero associative ideals (in particular, if A is prime), then\nDer(A) is a strongly non-degenerate Lie algebra.\nProof. (i). Use [5, Lemma 5.2], Proposition 2.3 (ii) and Lemma 2.4 (i).\n(ii) follows from (i) and condition (ii) in Lemma 2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now consider the case where our associative algebra A has an involution \u2217. Under some\nadditional mild assumptions on A in order to rule out algebras of low degrees, we obtain similar\nresults on the non-degeneracy of SDer(A). Rather than proving them in full, we just indicate\nwhich changes are needed to adjust Lemma 2.4 and Theorem 2.5 to the current setting.\nRecall that, if A is a semiprime associative algebra, the extended centroid C = C(A) of A is\ndefined as the center of the two-sided right ring of quotients. It also coincides with the center\nof Qs (A), the symmetric ring of quotients. For every x in an algebra A we define deg(x) as\nthe degree of algebraicity of x over the extended centroid C, provided that x is algebraic. If\nx is not algebraic, then we define deg(x) = \u221e. Put deg(A) = sup{deg(x) | x \u2208 A}. It is\nwell-known that deg(A) < \u221e if and only if A is a PI algebra. Furthermore, it is known that\ndeg(A) = n < \u221e if and only if A satisfies the standard polynomial identity of degree 2n, but\ndoes not satisfy any polynomial identity of degree < 2n, and this is further equivalent to the\ncondition that A can be embedded into the matrix algebra Mn (F ) for some field F (one can\ntake, say, F to be the algebraic closure of C), but cannot be embedded into Mn\u22121 (R) for any\ncommutative algebra R.\n(a) The analogue of (\u2020) in Lemma 2.4 is as follows:\nIf A is a semiprime algebra with involution, then if a belongs to the skew elements\nK in A and [[a, K], K] = 0 we get [a, K] = 0. To prove this, suppose a \u2208 K such that\n[a, K] 6= 0. This means that a 6= 0, where a denotes the class of a in K/ZK . But then\n[a, K/ZK ] 6= 0, since K/ZK is semiprime by [9, Theorem 3], that is, [[a, K], K] 6= 0.\n(b) The use of [7, Theorem 3] in the proof of condition (ii) in Lemma 2.4 must be changed\nto [12, Lemmas 2 and 3]. In order to apply these results, certain restrictions on the degree\nof the algebra are needed. Concretely, deg(A/I) > 2 for every \u2217-prime ideal I of A.\n\n\f8\n\nFRANCESC PERERA & MERCEDES SILES MOLINA\n\nRecall that an ideal I in an algebra A with involution \u2217 is a \u2217-ideal if I is invariant under\nthe involution, that is, I \u2217 = I. The algebra A is said to be \u2217-prime if the product of two\nnon-zero \u2217-ideals is again non-zero. A \u2217-ideal I is said to be \u2217-prime\nif A/I is a \u2217-prime algebra. The definition of a \u2217-semiprime algebra is analogous.\nDefine the following Lie ideal of SDer(A):\nIK,Z = {\u03b4 \u2208 SDer(A) | \u03b4(K) \u2286 Z} .\nIn the current context, our Lemma 2.4 takes then the following form.\nLemma 2.6. Let A be a semiprime non-commutative associative algebra with involution \u2217.\nThen:\n(i) Inn(K) is (isomorphic to) an essential ideal of SDer(A)/IK,Z , where IK,Z is defined as\nbefore.\n(ii) If Z(K) does not contain non-zero associative \u2217-ideals (in particular, if A is \u2217-prime),\nthen IK,Z = 0.\nThe analogue of [5, Lemma 5.2] (used in the proof of condition (i) in Theorem 2.5) is the\nproposition below, which again requires conditions on the degree of the algebra. In particular,\nit generalizes [1, Theorem 2.13]. Recall that an involution \u2217 in an associative algebra A is said\nto be of the first kind if it is the identity on the centroid of A. Otherwise it is called of the\nsecond kind.\nProposition 2.7. Let A be a \u2217-semiprime algebra. Assume that the involution is either of\nthe second kind, or else it is of the first kind and deg(A/I) > 2 for every \u2217-prime ideal I of\nA. Then [k, [k, K]] \u2286 Z(A), with k \u2208 K, implies k \u2208 Z(A). In particular, K/(K \u2229 Z) is a\nstrongly non-degenerate Lie algebra.\nProof. Let I be a \u2217-ideal of A. It is clear that A/I also becomes a \u2217-algebra with the natural\ninvolution.\nOn the other hand, if x denotes the class of an element x in A/I and K = {k | k \u2208 K},\nwe have that K = KA/I . The containment K \u2286 KA/I is clear, and for the converse, take a in\nKA/I and let y \u2208 I be such that a\u2217 + a = y. Then (a\u2217 \u2212 21 y)\u2217 = y \u2212 a \u2212 12 y = \u2212a + 12 y, that\nis, a \u2212 21 y \u2208 K, and a = a \u2212 21 y.\nNow, consider k \u2208 K satisfying [k, [k, K]] \u2286 Z. In particular, (ad k)3 (t) = 0 for every\nt \u2208 K. Arguing as in the proof of [5, Lemma 5.2], we obtain:\n(\u2021)\n\n(ad k)2 (t) = 0 .\n\nT\nLet {I\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u039b be the collection of all \u2217-prime ideals of A. Since A is \u2217-semiprime, \u03b1\u2208\u039b I\u03b1 = 0.\nSuppose [k, A/I\u03b2 ] 6= 0 for some \u03b2 \u2208 \u039b. Since A/I\u03b2 is a \u2217-prime algebra we may apply [2,\nLemma 5.4] in order to conclude that Z(K) = Z(A/I\u03b2 ) \u2229 K, and hence [k, K] 6= 0. Use [2,\nTheorem 5.3] if \u2217 : A/I\u03b2 \u2192 A/I\u03b2 is of the first kind, or [1, Theorem 2.13]\nif the involution is of the second kind, to conclude that [k, [k, K]]T6= 0, in contradiction to\n\u0003\n(\u2021). In consequence, [k, A/I\u03b1 ] = 0 for every \u03b1 \u2208 \u039b, that is, [k, A] \u2286 \u03b1\u2208\u039b I\u03b1 = 0.\nFinally, the involutive version of Theorem 2.5 is the following:\nTheorem 2.8. Let A be a \u2217-semiprime non-commutative associative algebra with deg(A/I) >\n2 for every \u2217-prime ideal I of A.
