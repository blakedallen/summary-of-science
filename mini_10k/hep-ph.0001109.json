A matter is gravitationally trapped in three space dimensions,\nbut both time-like directions are open. Choosing of the dimension and the signature\nof the model is initiated with the conformal symmetry for massless particles and any\npoint in our world can be (1+1) string-like object.\n\nPACS number: 98.80.Cq\nIn conventional Kaluza-Klein's picture extra dimensions are curled up to unobservable\nsize. Last years models with large extra dimensions become popular (see for example [1, 2]).\nThose approaches also do not contradict to present time experiments [3]. Main obstacles in\nprogress of such models were how to confine a matter inside brane-Universe and to explain\nobserved 4-dimensional Newton's law. In the papers [4, 5, 6, 7] we had introduced possible\nmechanism of overcoming these problems. Special solution of multi-dimensional Einstein's\nequations [4, 7, 8], responsible for gravitational trapping of a matter, provides effective\n4-dimensional Newton's law on the brane. In this model it can be explained also nonobservation of cosmological constant in four dimensions [4, 7, 9].\nIn our previous papers [4, 5, 6, 7] for simplicity 5-dimensional model with the signature\n(1+4) was considered. In general the question about the number of dimensions and signature\nis open. We consider that a matter is trapped on the brane by gravitation. So it is natural\nto assume that for massless case (it means weakest coupling with gravity) symmetries of\nsub-manifold can be restored. It is well known that in the zero-mass limit main equations\nof physics are invariant under fifteen parameter nonlinear conformal transformations. From\nthe other hand a long time ago it was discovered that conformal group can be written as\na linear Lorentz type transformations in 6-dimensional space-time with the signature (2+4)\n(for these subjects see for example [10]). Another indication that real number of space-like\ndimensions of Universe can be four, could be O(4) symmetry of the solution of Shrodinger\nequations for the hydrogen atom.\nTheories with extra time-like dimensions have been a subject of interest for some time (the\nlatest article about large extra time-like dimensions is [11], see also [12, 13]). Kaluza-Klein\n6-dimensional model with two times, but with compact extra dimensions, was investigated\nbefore in [14, 15]. Necessity of two times follow also from string theory (F-theory) [16]. There\nexist another two groups of 6-dimensional schemes, but with three times. The schemes of the\nfirst group [17, 18, 19] suffer from internal inconsistencies, second [20], more sophisticated\nscheme is internally consistent.\nIn all these papers multi time dimensions are introduced, however, not much is known\n1\n\n\fabout the classical vacuum solutions of two- or more-timing theories. It is known that\ntheories with compact internal time-like dimensions have several pathological features. The\nmost conspicuous may be the fact that excitations of the internal dimensions have negative\nnorm. Experimental lower bounds on possible violation of unitarity put a limit on the\nmaximum radius of the internal time-like directions [21].\nAfter unification of space and time coordinates (but not dimensions) in Lorents transformations many physicists intuitively are accustomed to consider space and time dimensions\nidentically. However, there is principal difference among them. Main difference is that one\ncan easily change position, or stop in the space but everybody follows to time flow which was\nbegan from the Big Bang. Decreasing of time flow, or shift of time vector for any system,\nmeans backward moving in the time and then disappearance for other observers. Another\nproblem is that we know several space directions and it is easy to add next ones, but we\nknow only one time. In case of two or more time directions the question arises what we are\nmeasuring with our clocks. Thus ordinary methods of trapping using in our previous papers\n[4, 5, 6, 7] can be not applicable for time-like dimensions.\nPossible indication of existence of extra time directions can be non-conservation of the\nenergy in four dimensions. This can be happening only after interaction with the matter with\nanother direction of time (or energy) vector. As we mentioned above we only passively follow\nto time flow, direction of which coincides with cosmological arrow of time (possible source\nof different asymmetries in our world, see for example [24]). So it could work mechanism\nsimilar to that considered in papers [20] - after some time from the Big Bang all particles\nwith another directions of time had been disappeared from our view. In this case may be no\nspecial trapping mechanism in extra times is necessary.\nAll points of the space in Universe are equivalent. However, we have global zero for\ntime coordinate, it is the moment of the Big Bang. What we measure for any particle is\nthe difference of two energies - energy of the vacuum and the particle itself. When particle\nfollows to our time flow we notice only this difference, but to shift the time vector we need\ntotal value of the energy corresponding to the age of Universe. Thus if the particles with\nanother energy vector had been disappeared the matter of our world is trapped in our time\nby Plank scale.\nIn this paper we consider 6-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model with one space-like and one\ntime-like extended extra dimension. It is generalization of 5-dimensional scheme of papers\n[4, 5, 6, 7] with one brane where all matter is localized. Trapping mechanism considered\nin these articles works for the case of one extra space-like dimension and is applicable for\n6-dimensional model with two times. Time-like dimensions in our scheme are open, similar\nto the approach of [20].\nWe are looking for solution of 6-dimensional Einstein's equations with the cosmological\nterm \u039b in two time- and four space-like dimensions\n6\n\n1\nRAB \u2212 gAB 6 R = \u2212\u039bgAB + G\u03c4AB .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere 6 RAB and G are 6-dimensional Ricci tensor and gravitational constant and big Latin\nindices A, B, ... = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.\nEnergy-momentum tensor for brane-Universe with the signature (2+3) embedded in 6-\n\n2\n\n\fdimensional space-time with signature (2+4) is taken in the form\nx6\nx6\n), \u03c455 = \u03c3\u03b4( ), \u03c466 = 0 .\n(2)\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u221a\nHere \u03c3 is brane tension, \u03b4(x6 /\u01eb) - delta function and \u01eb \u223c \u039b - brane width in extra space-like\ndimension x6 . Greek indices \u03b1, \u03b2... = 0, 1, 2, 3 numerate coordinates in four dimensions. This\nform of the brane energy-momentum follows from kink-like solution of scalar field equations\nwithout introducing of coupling with gravity. In general it is difficult to separate the energy\nof the brane and gravitation field and we must consider more complicate model.\nIn (1) we choose negative sign for cosmological constant \u039b. Canceling mechanism of\npapers [4, 5, 6, 7] for space-like extra dimension works only for the negative \u039b. Solution with\npositive \u039b corresponds to trapping in extra time and is considered at the end of the paper.\nIn many Kaluza-Klein models with large extra dimensions localization of particular quantum fields on the brane is investigated (latest paper in this direction is [22]). In our model\n[4, 5, 6, 7] matter is trapped on the brane by gravitation. The source of anti-gravity responsible for this trapping can be negative multi-dimensional cosmological constant. Since\ngravity is universal field we don't need any other classical source for localization of a matter\non the brane. Exact mechanism for different fields is difficult to find because of problems\nwith consideration of quantum fields in curve space-time (see for example [23]). Even in four\ndimensions only few exactly solvable models exist. Our approach is more general. Gravitation field is not localized on the brane, however, by canceling mechanism we have ordinary\nNewton's law. Gravitational potential has minimum on the brane and all particles having\ncoupling with gravity are sitting there.\nTo keep the width of brane-Universe during expansion, it means for the stabile localization\nof the mater on the brane, as in paper [6] we look for the solution of (1) with zero extra\nmomentum\nZ\nPi = TiA dSA = 0 .\n(3)\n\u03c4\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03b4(\n\nSmall Latin indices i, j, k, ... = 5, 6 numerate coordinates of extra dimensions.

Some particular cases are considered in the\npaper [6].\nIn this article we don't want to touch the old problem with the energy of gravitation and\nas in the paper [6] choose TAB in the form of so called Lorentz energy-momentum complex\nTAB =\nwhere\nXABC = \u2212XACB =\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n\u221a \u2202C XABC ,\n2G g\n\n(5)\n\ng[g BD g CE (\u2202D gAE \u2212 \u2202E gAD )] .\n\n(6)\n\nThis form is convenient, since in this case energy-momentum tensor of gravitational field tB\nA\ncoincides with canonical energy-momentum tensor (4) received from Hilbert's form of the\n\u221a\ngravitational Lagrangian Lg = g( 6 R \u2212 2\u039b).\n3\n\n\fTo satisfy the stability condition (3), components of the energy-momentum tensor on the\nsolutions must satisfy the condition\nTiA = 0 .\n(7)\nFrom (i\u03b1) component of this relation and (4) we find \u2202i \u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd = 0.

After adding of 4-dimensional\nsource at the right hand of (15) one can show that as in 5-dimensional case [4, 7] a matter is\ntrapped in three space with ordinary Newton's low, while now we have unobservable extra\nopen time direction.\nFrom (14) we see that constant c is real only for our choice of sign of \u039b. Also we noticed\nthat for branes with positive tension constant c is negative and function \u03bb decreasing fare\nfrom the brane, as in papers [2]. For the case of negative \u03c3 exponential factor in (13) is\npositive as in papers [4, 7, 8] and gravitational potential has minimum on the brane.\nIn this paper and our previous articles [4, 5, 6, 7], in contrast with the approach of [2],\nwe consider only one brane. Interactions of branes with the negative and positive tensions\nare often considered in Kaluza-Klein theories with the large extra dimensions. One must be\ncareful in this case. It is known for a long time [25] that system of negative and positive\nmasses began to accelerate till the speed of the light. Acceleration can destroy the branes.\nEven one brane with positive tension is strange objects, since it is gravitationally repulsive\n[26]. This can cause change of the time direction on the brane [27], while t2 is still positive.\nNegative tension can change signature and thus interchanges time and space coordinates.\nSystem (11) with positive \u039b has similar to (13) solution\n\u03bb = \u2212g66 = exp(c|x5 |) ,\n\ng55 = 1 ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich corresponds to trapping in extra time, while all four space-like coordinates are open.\nAt the end of the paper we want to note that in this paper 6-dimensional model with\nstring-like extra dimension was considered. Any point-like particle in our world can have tail\nin (1+1) dimensions and we have interesting possibility for nontrivial application of string\ntheory.\n\nReferences\n[1] N. Arkani-Hamed, S.
