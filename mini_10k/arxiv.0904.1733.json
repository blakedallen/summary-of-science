Several characteristic indicators for QGP formation have been proposed, one being modification of\nparton scattering and fragmentation to hadron jets in\nmore-central A-A collisions [2]. Colored partons should\nbe uniquely sensitive to the presence and properties of a\ncolor-deconfined medium. In A-A collisions jets are studied combinatorially through dihadron correlations analyzed and interpreted in the context of parton energy\nloss in a dense medium [3]. Two diametrically-opposed\npictures have emerged from jet correlation analysis.\nIn the conventional picture the scattered-parton spectrum extends down as far as 1 GeV, resulting in copious\nparton production near that energy (estimating \u223c1000\ngluons per unit rapidity) [4, 5]. Most partons deposit a\nlarge fraction of their energy in a \"medium\" and are thermalized [5, 6], producing a large energy density with accompanying pressure gradients which in turn drive large\nflow magnitudes (longitudinal, radial, elliptic) [7].\nThe medium forms an \"opaque core\" which can stop\nenergetic partons and which is surrounded by a less-dense\n\"corona\" from which single partons may escape radially\noutward while their in-going partners are stopped in the\nmedium [8, 9]. That picture is said to account for systematic modification of triggered dihadron correlations\n(usually with asymmetric pt cuts) [10] and single-particle\nspectra (jet quenching and high-pt suppression) [11].\nHowever, recent analysis conflicts with the existence\nof a thermalized dense partonic medium and presents a\ndifferent picture of A-A collisions. Untriggered angular\ncorrelations (no pt cuts applied) [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] reveal that far from being \"quenched\" or lost to thermalization essentially all initially-scattered partons survive to\nproduce correlated hadrons, albeit jets are significantly\nmodified in more-central A-A collisions. Jet correlations\nare dominated by minijets [17]. Strong back-to-back\n(mini)jet correlations are still observed for all collision\nsystems [14]. Two-component analysis of pt spectra re-\n\nveals that the hard component is quantitatively described\nby pQCD for all A-A centralities, and the full parton\nspectrum is manifested as correlated fragments in the final state [18, 19]. The same hadron spectrum analysis\nalso indicates that the scattered parton spectrum terminates near 3 GeV, not 1 GeV, implying a factor 25 less\nparton production (less density) than the conventional\npicture.\nAnalysis of dihadron correlations typically incorporates several important assumptions: 1) background subtraction is determined in part by zero yield at minimum\n(ZYAM) [20]. 2) A contribution from \"elliptic flow\" is\ndetermined by independent measurement of an azimuth\nquadrupole component in the form v22 [21]. 3) pt cuts\ndefine correlations from \"hard scattering\" as opposed to\nsoft processes which could contaminate jet correlations.\nCertain features of dihadron correlations and interpretations which support parton energy loss in a dense, thermalized medium depend critically on those assumptions.\nIt is important to resolve the striking incompatibility\nbetween two collision models emerging from the same\nunderlying RHIC data. In this analysis I re-examine dihadron correlation analysis methods, with special attention to the ZYAM assumption, v2 subtraction and the\nconsequences of trigger/associated pt cuts.\nII.\n\nDIHADRON AZIMUTH CORRELATIONS\n\nModification of parton scattering and jet formation in\nmore-central A-A collisions is seen as a possible signal of\nQGP formation. Jets are observed as per-trigger azimuth\ncorrelations by combinatoric reconstruction. Background\nsubtraction, including ZYAM and v2 estimation, plays a\ncentral role in jet correlation analysis and interpretation.\nA.\n\nDihadron correlation analysis\n\nHigh-pt dihadron azimuth correlations are used to\nstudy possible jet modifications in A-A relative to p-p\ncollisions. The density of particle pairs which satisfy\n\n\f2\ncertain pt (transverse momentum) cuts (\"trigger\" and\n\"associated\" particles) is plotted on azimuth difference\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03c6associated \u2212 \u03c6trigger . Trigger particles fall within\none of two (usually asymmetric) pt intervals. Combinatoric jet reconstruction is a proxy for true event-wise jet\nreconstruction in A-A collisions with large multiplicities.\nA combinatoric background must be subtracted from\nthe \"sibling\" (same-event) pair density to obtain the true\ndistribution of jet-correlated pairs. The background is\nassumed to be modulated by an elliptic flow (v2 ) contribution. v2 is estimated by separate v2 -specific analysis. The zero reference is determined conventionally\nby the ZYAM assumption. In p-p and peripheral A-A\ncollisions the dominant structures are a same-side (SS,\n|\u2206\u03c6| < \u03c0/2) peak (nominally Gaussian), an away-side\n(AS, |\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0| < \u03c0/2) peak, and a cos(2\u2206\u03c6) sinusoid\nmeasured by v22 (azimuth quadrupole).\nThe ZYAM subtraction applied to more-central A-A\ncollisions produces apparently interesting structures in\nthe away-side component (nominally back-to-back jets)\ninterpreted by some in terms of \"Mach cones,\" possibly\nthe result of energetic partons interacting with a dense\nQCD medium [22, 23, 24]. However, the supporting arguments for ZYAM are questionable, and values of v2 used\nin the subtraction may be substantially overestimated\nleading to distortions of true jet correlations.\n\nB.\n\nJet phenomenology\n\nAn initial analysis of jet-related azimuth correlations\nin 200 GeV 0-10% central Au-Au collisions compared to\np-p collisions imposed a high-pt cutoff (2-4 GeV/c) on the\nassociated-particle interval as a means to insure that true\njet phenomena dominated the correlations [10]. Combinatoric background subtraction invoked ZYAM and utilized values of v2 (pt ) from independent measurements.\nMean value v2 = 0.07 was used for the subtraction. The\ncorrelation analysis followed observation of high-pt suppression in single-particle spectra [11]. The major conclusion was \"disappearance of the away-side jet\" (apparent\nback-to-back jet suppression).\nFollowup studies [25, 26] sought to determine where\nthe energy \"lost\" at larger pt appears in the final state.\nJet correlations below 4 GeV/c were said to be affected by hydrodynamic flows and quark coalescence believed to dominate hadron production in that pt interval [25]. Combinatoric techniques permitted extension of\nassociated-particle pt cuts to as low as 0.15 GeV/c.\nAzimuth correlations from conventional (ZYAM) analysis have the following characteristics: When smaller-pt\nassociated particles are included both SS and AS peaks\nare broadened on azimuth in more-central Au-Au collisions, and the AS pt spectrum is \"softened\" [26]. The SS\npeak is enhanced relative to p-p, and the AS peak develops a minimum (dip) at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0. Those systematics are\nthought to reveal \"characteristics of the energy transport\nof the quenched partons\" on both pt and \u2206\u03c6 [25].\n\nC.\n\nConventional physics interpretation\n\nThe results of [10] were interpreted to reveal an opaque\n\"core\" (dense medium) formed in more-central Au-Au\ncollisions which stops most partons produced in or passing through that region. The core was interpreted as a\nthermalized QCD medium with large matter and energy\ndensities [8, 9]. Partons which interact strongly in the\nmedium lose most of their energy by radiating gluons\nand are thermalized [25]. \"The away side jet traverses a\nlarge amount of matter\" [emphasis added] [26]. \"Shower\"\ngluons may be emitted at large angles, possibly resulting\nin novel jet structures [23, 24]. pQCD calculations of\nparton energy loss require 30 times normal nuclear gluon\ndensity to account for central Au-Au results [27].\nIn the core-corona model of A-A collisions some partons are produced in a less-dense \"corona\" region outside the dense core and may survive to fragment outside\nthe A-A system [25]. High-pt hadrons and hadron pairs\nmainly come from such partons, which suffer minimal interaction with the medium. Partons with pt > 5 GeV/c\nare said to exhibit in-vacuum fragmentation based on\n1) a p-p-like single-particle power-law spectrum and/or\nsuppression (e.g., RAA [28]) independent of pt , and 2)\np-p-like azimuth correlations with distinct SS and AS\nGaussians.\nAccording to [26] increased soft-particle production in\nAu-Au compared to p-p indicates parton thermalization.\nFinal hadron remnants in central Au-Au collisions no\nlonger exhibit jet-like correlations. Persistence of a broad\nAS peak structure at smaller pt indicates global momentum conservation. Interactions seem to drive particles\nfrom jet fragmentation and from the bulk medium toward mutual equilibrium, possibly implying a high degree of thermalization of the \"medium.\" A significant\namount of associated-particle energy may come from the\nmedium through recombination, scattering or flow.\n\nD.\n\nAlternative interpretations\n\nRecent analysis suggests alternative interpretations of\nspectra and angular correlations. Two-component analysis of 200 GeV Au-Au spectra [18, 19] suggests that the\nspectrum hard component represents fragments from the\nentire initial-state parton spectrum. Fragmentation functions are modified in more-central A-A collisions, but no\npartons are lost to thermalization. Analysis of 2D angular\ncorrelations [14] is consistent with that picture: minijet\ncorrelation strength is proportional to N-N binary collisions (nbinary ) for peripheral collisions, but increases\nmore rapidly than nbinary for more-central collisions.\nTriggered azimuth correlations are not easily compared\nwith normalized per-participant minimum-bias results.\nSuch comparisons could serve to test the extent of parton thermalization by direct comparison to pQCD predictions [19]. High-pt trigger particles are themselves subject to changes in A-A dynamics with centrality. In con-\n\n\f3\ntrast, absolute spectrum and correlation measures reveal\nthat while AS correlations are strongly altered, scattered\npartons are not thermalized (stopped in a medium).\nThe SS jet width in 1D azimuth correlations does not\nincrease significantly with A-A centrality as would be\nexpected from strong parton interactions with a dense\nmedium (multiple scattering or gluon bremsstrahlung).\nIn fact, for minimum-bias 2D correlations the SS peak\nazimuth width is observed to decrease with increasing\ncentrality [14]. No SS jet structure corresponds to \"Mach\ncones.\" Persistence of a broad AS peak at smaller pt has\nbeen attributed to global momentum conservation [26],\nbut the AS peak amplitude scales with binary collisions,\nnot with participant pairs as would be expected for global\nconservation.\nImposition of a 2-4 GeV/c associated cut in [10] led\nto the conclusion that the AS jet is eliminated in morecentral A-A collisions, implying absorption (thermalization) of one of the scattered partons. However, rejecting\nassociated particles in the 0.15-2 GeV/c interval introduces a large bias. Extension of the AS pt interval down\nto 0.15 GeV/c reveals copious AS jet correlations. AS\ncorrelation structure is dominated by inter jet or jet-jet\n(parton-parton) correlations, not intra jet correlations.\nAS peak modifications per se may not reflect changes\nin parton abundance or fragmentation.\nEffects of kt broadening may dominate AS correlation\nstructure. The role of initial-state parton multiple scattering in A-A collisions is still not fully appreciated, although kt broadening has been studied with Monte Carlo\nsimulations [10]. The role of independently-measured v2\nin combinatoric background subtraction which isolates\njet correlations is also not well-defined. Oversubtraction\nof v2 can (and does) result in substantial artifacts.\nProduction of a dense QCD medium could indeed result in jet quenching and other QGP \"signals,\" but modifications to parton scattering and fragmentation observed\nto date don't require production of a QGP. Given the importance of angular correlations and jet-related phenomena to interpretation of RHIC data we should reconsider\nthe conventional picture in light of recent results.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE ZYAM SUBTRACTION PROCEDURE\n\nThe main object of \"triggered\" dihadron correlation\nanalysis is systematic study of jet structure variations\nwith A-A centrality and trigger/associated combinations\nof pt cuts. Accurate isolation of jet correlations from\nother correlation structure is technically challenging.\nThe distribution of \"sibling\" pairs (pairs within single\nevents) averaged over an event ensemble contains contributions from several sources: 1) uncorrelated combinatoric background, 2) back-to-back jet pairs, 3) isolated\njets (partner outside the \u03b7 acceptance), 4) an azimuth\nquadrupole component conventionally attributed to elliptic flow and 5) small contributions from other sources\n(e.g., quantum correlations, electron pairs from gamma\n\nconversions).\nTo isolate jet contributions 2) + 3) in the ZYAM procedure a subtraction is performed. A nominally uncorrelated mixed-pair reference distribution 1) approximates the combinatoric background structure (e.g., acceptance/efficiency azimuth variations). But normalization of mixed pairs relative to sibling pairs depends in\npart on fluctuation sources (e.g., impact parameter fluctuations, large-scale correlations) which are not reliably\nestimated at present. The normalization is instead determined by the ZYAM criterion. The quadrupole component 4) is estimated from measurements of v2 (pt ) by a\nvariety of methods which are susceptible to various \"nonflow\" errors (mainly jet correlations). Background 1) is\nthen modulated by the estimated quadrupole amplitude,\nassuming a thermalized flowing bulk medium.\n\nA.\n\nDihadron correlations\n\nAbsent particle identification two-(charged)-particle\ncorrelations are measured. Electron pairs due to photon conversions from \u03c0 0 decays appear near the angular\norigin, are prominent in 2D angular autocorrelations [14]\nand may distort the 1D same-side (jet) peak on azimuth.\nThe electron-pair structure is narrow on pseudorapidity\nas well as azimuth difference, and is thus suppressed to\nsome extent in the 1D azimuth projection.\nDihadron correlations have three main components:\n1) a same-side (SS) peak centered at the origin, nominally Gaussian in shape and representing intra jet correlations, 2) an away-side (AS) peak centered at \u03c0 and\nrepresenting inter jet correlations from back-to-back jets,\n3) a cos(2\u2206\u03c6) term conventionally measured by v22 . The\ncos(2\u2206\u03c6) term is the azimuth quadrupole component [29].\n\nB.\n\nTrigger/associated pt cuts\n\n\"Triggered\" jet correlation analysis emulates eventwise jet reconstruction in the high-multiplicity environment of A-A collisions by imposing pt cuts on particle\npairs. A trigger particle at larger pt is intended to estimate the leading-parton momentum. An associated particle at smaller pt should then sample the jet fragment\ndistribution. Aside from that model-dependent language\nthe resulting azimuth correlations correspond to specific\ncut boxes on the space (pt1 , pt2 ). Minimum-bias or \"untriggered\" jet correlations are obtained by applying no pt\ncuts other than an acceptance cut near 0.1 GeV/c.\nAn asymmetric cut system has some validity for trigger\npt > 4 GeV/c where the jet multiplicity is significantly\nlarger than 2. For the majority of jets (minijets) that condition is not satisfied. A symmetric pt cut then minimizes\nbias [13]. Asymmetric pt cuts imply significant distance\nfrom the diagonal of the (pt1 , pt2 ) cut space, which has\nimplications for joint v22 (pt1 , pt2 ) distributions compared\nto marginal distributions and factorization assumptions.\n\n\fv2 estimation\n\nAzimuth correlation measure v2 is estimated by several methods denoted by v2 {method}, e.g. v2 {2} (twoparticle correlations), v2 {EP } (event plane or \"standard\" method), v2 {4} (four-particle cumulants), etc. [30].\nIn practice, different methods return different v2 values for the same physical conditions, depending on the\namount of \"nonflow\" (minijets) confused by each method\nwith the intended quadrupole component [29, 31].\nVarious strategies are employed to reduce contributions from nonflow and v2 fluctuations. v2 {4} is said\nto eliminate nonflow contributions assuming nonflow\nis \"clusters\" of 2-3 particles (inconsistent with minijet\nsystematics in more-central Au-Au collisions). Average (v22 {2} + v22 {4})/2 is said to eliminate contributions\nfrom v2 fluctuations based on several physical assumptions [31]. In the simulations presented here v22 {2} is\ndetermined by a fit (light dotted curve) to the entire azimuth distribution, and the background quadrupole amplitude v22 is defined by v22 {2}/2 (assuming v22 {4} = 0 for\ncentral A-A collisions). v22 is in that case locked to the\namplitude of the SS Gaussian.\nThe quadrupole contribution relevant to two-particle\ncorrelations subject to pt cuts is determined by joint\ndistribution v22 (pt1 , pt2 ), which has not been measured.\nIn the conventional approach factorization is assumed-\nv22 (pt1 , pt2 ) \u2248 v2 (pt1 ) v2 (pt2 ), where v2 (pt ) is from a\nseparately-measured marginal distribution.\nD.\n\nZYAM background subtraction\n\nThe per-event and per-trigger \"raw\" pair density is\n*\n+\nX\n1\nR(\u2206\u03c6; pt1 , pt2 ) =\n\u03b4(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j \u2212 \u2206\u03c6) (1)\nNtrig i\u2208p ,j\u2208p\nt1\n\nt2\n\naveraged over an event ensemble and integrated over\npseudorapidity acceptance \u2206\u03b7, where pt1 and pt2P\ndenote\n\"trigger\" and \"associated\" cut bins and Ntrig \u2261 i\u2208pt1 .\nBy hypothesis R includes jet-correlated pairs S (the jet\nsignal) and (uncorrelated + v2 ) background B.

The systematic error of\nthe subtraction is sometimes estimated by the statistical\nerror in a small interval about the minimum (e.g. [25]).\n\nIV.\n\nAZIMUTH CORRELATION STRUCTURE\n\nIn p-p collisions triggered 1D azimuth correlations are\napproximated by Gaussian peaks centered at 0 and \u03c0 radians. In A-A collisions the structure evolves strongly\nwith centrality. The AS peak broadens and a cos(2\u2206\u03c6)\n(quadrupole) sinusoid dominates the structure for intermediate centralities. Either jet peak may deviate from\na Gaussian shape. The main question is how to isolate\ntrue jet correlation structure while minimizing bias.\n\nA.\n\nPeriodic peak arrays\n\nDistributions on azimuth are periodic. Peaks (nominally Gaussian) at 0 (SS, same-side) and \u03c0 (AS, awayside) are elements of periodic arrays. The SS array is\ncentered on even multiples of \u03c0, the AS array on odd\nmultiples. Nearby elements of an array outside a 2\u03c0 interval can have a significant effect on distributions within\nthe interval and should be included in fit models. Failure to include nearby members of both peak arrays may\nresult in significant fitting errors, especially for broader\npeaks.\n\n\f5\n\nS(\u2206\u03c6; \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 , n) = A0,n + A1,n {1 + cos(\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 n \u03c0)}/2\n\u221e\nX\nAm,n cos(m [\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 n \u03c0]),\n(3)\n+\nm=2\n\n0.25\nSS\n\n0.2\n\nAS\n\nAm(\u03c3\u2206\u03c6)\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nwhere the Am,n are functions of Gaussian width \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 , n\nis even for SS peak arrays (+), and odd for AS arrays\n(\u2212). The terms represent 2m poles, e.g. dipole (m =\n1), quadrupole (m = 2), sextupole (m = 3). As peak\nwidth \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 increases the number of significant terms in\nthe series decreases. The limiting case is \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0/2,\nfor which a peak array is approximated by a constant\nplus single dipole term-[1 + cos(\u2206\u03c6)]/2 (SS) or [1 \u2212\ncos(\u2206\u03c6)]/2 (AS). For Gaussian peak arrays with \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 < 1\n(and therefore nonzero sextupole) a Gaussian function is\nthe more efficient representation.\nFig. 2 (left panel) illustrates the sum of peak arrays\n(solid points) for SS and AS peaks extending beyond one\n2\u03c0 interval. The SS Gaussian peak array is the dashdotted curve, the AS array with \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0/2 is the dashed\ncurve (approximately pure dipole).

For narrower\npeaks terms with m > 1 become significant.\nB.\n\nThe quadrupole component\n\nAnalysis whose main objective is \"elliptic flow\" measures some part of the total quadrupole component of azimuth correlations depending on the specific \"method.\"\nThere are three phenomenological sources of the total\n\nquadrupole component: the SS jet peak, the AS jet peak\nand the non-jet (NJ) background. The NJ component\nmay or may not be related to a hydro phenomenon.\nThe m = 2 Fourier amplitude of the entire azimuth\ndistribution is A2 = 2 A0 v22 {2}, based on the definition of v22 {2} \u223c v22 {EP }. The m = 2 Fourier terms\nfrom the SS and AS peak arrays contribute to v22 {2}\na combined \"nonflow\" systematic error \u03b42 . If the AS\npeak is broad (typical for more-central A-A collisions\nand/or untriggered correlations) \"nonflow\" \u03b42 is dominated by the SS peak.

It is claimed that due to in-medium modifications\npeak shapes may not be Gaussian. \"Rigorous decomposition of the jet from its underlying event currently\nrequires assumptions about the jet shape or the physics\nof the underlying event\" [25]. Studies with PYTHIA are\ninterpreted to conclude a substantial difference between\npeak shapes with and without radiation effects, including\nnon-Gaussian shapes. Given such difficulties the ZYAM\nprocedure is invoked as an alternative.\ndNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nA peak array (SS or AS) can be represented by a\nFourier series of the form\n\nradiation\n\n10 3\n\nno radiation\n\n10 2\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nFIG. 3: Simulated dihadron correlations for p-p collisions\nfrom PYTHIA [25] with cuts 3-5\u00d73-5 GeV/c applied illustrating deviations from Gaussian peak structures with (upper)\nand without (lower) initial- and final-state radiation invoked.\n\nFig. 3 shows PYTHIA simulations (samples from Fig. 5\nof [25]) which reveal changes in peak shapes with and\nwithout initial- and final-state radiation.

Right: Same, but\nfor data with radiation invoked in PYTHIA.\n\nFigure 5 shows the same elements on a linear format.\nEspecially for the SS peaks the difference between true\nand modified Gaussian is subtle.\nThe good agreement between Eq. (4) and the PYTHIA\nsimulations reveals that deviations from Gaussians are\nprimarily due to width fluctuations. For the extreme case\nof Fig. 3 (high pt cuts, \u03c3\u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.15) deviations of the peak\nshape from a Gaussian in p-p collisions are obvious on\na semilog plot. However, the peak shape is amenable to\nexact description with a simple extension of the Gaussian\nmodel function to include fluctuations.\nFor cut systems typically encountered in dihadron\nstudies at RHIC the SS peak width is more typically\n0.4 to 0.5 rather than 0.16 as in the PYTHIA study.\n\n9000\n8000\n6000\n5000\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nradiation\n\n7000\n\n5000\n\n0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nFIG. 5: Same as Fig. 4 but plotted on a linear scale.\n\nOther things being equal that implies a ten-fold decrease\nin relative variance 1/4n. SS peak shapes should then be\nindistinguishable from true Gaussians. In central Au-Au\ncollisions fluctuations in the SS peak width should be reduced five-fold by central-limit averaging, since there are\non average 30 \u00b1 6 minijets in each collision [19]. The\nmean AS peak width increases substantially in morecentral Au-Au collisions, further reducing the effective\n1/4n, but driving the peak shape toward a pure dipole\nshape.\nFor p-p collisions and pt cuts below 6 GeV/c, especially for minijet (minimum-bias jet) structure, and for\nmore-central Au-Au collisions, the SS peak shape is accurately modeled by a Gaussian. The AS peak is accurately\nmodeled by three terms of a Fourier series (or a Gaussian in some cases). Background subtraction with small\nsystematic uncertainties can be achieved by peak fitting.\nD.\n\n\u03c3\u03c6 = 0.26\nn = 1.5\n2\n\n9000\n\ndNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nA\n\u0010\n\ndNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nset, that the alternative ZYAM method is necessary.\nTo test that assertion the modified-Gaussian form\n\n2D angular autocorrelations\n\n2D angular autocorrelations on difference variables\n\u03b7\u2206 = \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 and \u03c6\u2206 = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 provide substantial additional information beyond the 1D azimuth projection. The typical correlation structure includes a\n2D SS peak, an AS peak on azimuth (AS ridge) independent of pseudorapidity difference, and an azimuth\nquadrupole [29, 31].\nThe SS 2D peak is unambiguously isolated by model\nfits because of its variation on pseudorapidity difference.\nThe AS ridge and azimuth quadrupole are uniform on\n\u03b7\u2206 and thus project onto 1D azimuth without loss of\ninformation. The AS peak is typically dominated by\nthe dipole term. For more-central A-A collisions, and\ngenerally for untriggered correlations, the AS peak may\nbe pure dipole, in which case it is orthogonal to the\nquadrupole component. For peripheral A-A or p-p collisions and higher-pt cuts an AS Gaussian is more efficient.\nFor intermediate cases (\u03c3\u03c6\u2206 \u223c 1.0 - 1.2) the AS dipole\nmodel may allow a small contribution \u03b42,\u2212 to measured\nquadrupole amplitude v22 {2D} which then establishes an\nupper limit on any independent (nonjet) quadrupole component v22 {N J}.\nFig. 6 (left panel) illustrates untriggered (no special pt\n\n\f7\n\n\u2206\u03c1 / \u221a\u03c1ref\n\ncuts) 2D angular correlations for 200 GeV mid-central\nAu-Au collisions [14]. The SS peak is a 2D Gaussian\nwhich can be reliably isolated from the other correlation\nstructure.

The result is a dipole (solid curve)\nplus quadrupole (dotted curve).\n\nFig. 6 (right panel) shows the distribution in the left\npanel with the 2D Gaussian fit removed and the difference projected onto azimuth (points). The AS peak\nwidth for untriggered correlations is typically \u03c3\u03c6\u2206 \u223c \u03c0/2,\nand the peak is essentially a dipole. The AS peak and\nquadrupole are therefore orthogonal, implying negligible\ncovariances among the three model components: SS 2D\nGaussian, AS dipole and quadrupole.\n2D autocorrelations can also be constructed for specific\n(symmetric or asymmetric) pt cuts, providing combinatorial triggered jet reconstruction with reduced ambiguity. 2D histograms provide the most direct and accurate\naccess to joint distribution v22 (pt1 , pt2 ). There is no evidence in 2D autocorrelations for the AS double-peaked\nstructures resulting from ZYAM subtraction.\n\nThe ZYAM procedure explicitly assumes that subtracted background B emerges from a thermalized bulk\nmedium. Almost all particles, otherwise uncorrelated,\nare then correlated with the reaction plane and described\nby v22 , motivating the structure of B in Eq. (2). The\nproblem remains to determine the true background offset\nfor azimuth correlations, the constant B0 in Eq. (2). In\nprinciple, the background for sibling pairs accepted in cut\nbox (pt1 , pt2 ) should be the mean pair ratio hn1 n2 i/n\u03041 n\u03042\ntimes the mixed-pair background normalized to pair\nnumber n\u03041 n\u03042 , in which case B0 = hn1 n2 i.\nHowever, covariance hn1 n2 i\u2212 n\u03041 n\u03042 (a fluctuation measure) contains contributions other than jet correlations.\nPositive contributions include centrality (b) fluctuations\nand correlations with characteristic lengths exceeding the\nangular acceptance. Negative contributions include possible local anticorrelations and, most importantly, canonical suppression of fluctuations if a centrality condition\nis imposed on nch within the pair angular acceptance or\nsome part of it. Thus, B0 cannot be determined directly\nfrom present fluctuation [hn1 n2 i] measurements.\nAlternatively, B0 could be determined directly from\ncorrelation structure by model (e.g., Gaussian) fits to the\nSS and AS peaks. The main argument against model fitting is that the collision process could modify peak structures away from a Gaussian shape. Incorrect fit models\nmight then lead to biased background subtraction. If SS\nand AS peaks are overlapping ZYAM is invoked by that\nargument to determine B0 .\nZYAM implicitly assumes that real distributions do\nnot contain overlapping peaks, which contradicts many\nexamples in nature including nuclear collisions. For most\nof the centrality range of Au-Au collisions and some\npt cuts the same-side and away-side peaks do overlap\nstrongly, and the true background offset can differ greatly\nfrom the ZYAM estimate.\n\nB.\nV.\n\nZYAM CRITIQUE\n\nThe purpose of this analysis is to examine the validity\nof the ZYAM procedure and consequent novel structures\nin reported jet correlations. In this section we review the\nlogic and consequences of ZYAM.\n\nA.\n\nAssumptions supporting ZYAM\n\nThe background level (zero offset) of sibling-pair distribution R in Eq. (1) is well-defined when SS and AS\npeaks are completely separated, as in p-p collisions with\n\"high-pt \" cuts. For other collision systems or lower pt\ncuts the peaks may overlap, and the background level is\nnot then visually obvious. For overlapping peaks and at\nhigher pt , especially in more-central A-A collisions, v22\nsubtraction is also ambiguous.\n\nEstimating v22 (pt1 , pt2 )\n\nThe subtracted background includes v22 correlations\n(azimuth quadrupole). In Eq. (2) joint distribution\nv22 (pt1 , pt2 ) has been replaced by product v2 (pt1 ) v2 (pt2 )\nassuming factorization. The factors (marginal distributions) are determined by separate analysis. Factorization is defended by the claim that in a thermalized bulk\nmedium particles have no correlations among themselves,\nonly with the common reaction plane.\nv2 (pt ) is measured by several methods denoted by\nv2 {method}, e.g., v2 {2} (two-particle correlations),\nv2 {EP } (event plane), v2 {4} (four-particle cumulants),\netc. [30]. At larger pt v2 {2} or v2 {EP } is favored because\nof smaller particle yields. Both are strongly sensitive to\nminijets (nonflow). Extraction of an azimuth quadrupole\ncomponent from 2D angular correlations provides alternative measure v2 {2D} which is by construction independent of jet correlations to good approximation [31].\nIn conventional flow analysis it has been assumed that\n\n\f8\n\n8.4\n8.3\n8.2\n\n0.5232E-05/ 19\n8.000\n0.5011\n0.5011\n0.3001\n-0.4948E-03\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\n\n8.3\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\n8.6\n\n8.4\n\n8.6\n\n8.4\n8.3\n8.2\n\n8.1\n\n8.1\n\n8\n\n0.1375E-04/ 18\n8.000\n0.4778\n0.4866\n0.3060\n1.289\n-0.3613E-02\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\nP6\n\n8.5\n\n8.2\n\n8\n0\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n8\n\n0\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n0.2868E-04/ 19\n-0.1565\n0.4951\n0.4972\n0.2957\n-0.2857E-01\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nA typical ZYAM analysis\n\nFigure 7 (left panel) shows simulated azimuth correlation data (points) for central (b = 0) Au-Au collisions.

The inferred r.m.s. width 1.3 of\nthe AS Gaussian is consistent with the dipole model.\nFigure 8 (left panel) uses the same simulated data to\nillustrate the ZYAM procedure. For this example v22 {2}\nis determined as above, and (ideal) v22 {4} is zero. If the v22\nsubtraction is defined by quadratic mean v22 = (v22 {2} +\nv22 {4})/2 then since A0 \u223c 8 the subtracted value is v22 =\n0.12/(2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8), or v2 = 0.06 (compared to 0.07 in [10]).\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nv22 {2} = v\u030422 +\u03c3v22\u0001 and v22 {4} = v\u030422 \u2212\u03c3v22 , so that mean value\nv22 {2} + v22 {4} /2 = v\u030422 eliminates \"flow fluctuations\"\n\u03c3v22 [31, 33]. The mean value is often used to determine\nv2 (pt ) factors for Eq. (2). But v22 {2} = v22 {2D}+\u03b42 which\ndefines \"nonflow\" \u03b42 , dominated by the m = 2 Fourier\ncomponent of the SS Gaussian (mini)jet peak [31]. And\nv22 {4} may also include minijet contribution \u03b42\u2032 in morecentral Au-Au collisions, because minijets\n\u0001 then have multiplicities \u2265 4. Thus, v22 {2} + v22 {4} /2 \u2192 v22 {2D} \u2212\n\u03c3v22 + (\u03b42 + \u03b42\u2032 )/2, and independent (nonjet) quadrupole\ncomponent v22 {2D} may be a small fraction of the nonflow (jet) terms for more-central Au-Au collisions.\nIn Fig. 1 (left panel) the light dotted curve represents\nv22 {2} obtained (per its definition) by fitting the entire\nazimuth distribution with cos(2\u2206\u03c6). By construction\nthe data contain no independent quadrupole component.\nThus, v22 {2} = \u03b42 is entirely \"nonflow\" or jet correlations.\nIn essence, the quadrupole component of jet correlations\nis subtracted from jet correlations to produce distortions.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 8: Left: Simulated data as in Fig. 7 with ZYAM background model (bold dotted curve).

In other words, no distribution information is lost by the ZYAM subtraction,\nbut the result is visually misleading. In particular, the v22\noversubtraction results in a minimum in the AS peak, and\nthe ZYAM offset subtraction imposes a large reduction\nin apparent jet yields. The same fit model was applied\nin Fig. 1 (right panel), with similar results.\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nFIG. 7: Left: Simulated azimuth correlation data (points)\nincluding a SS Gaussian (dash-dotted curve) and AS dipole\n(dashed curve).

In comparing the\ntwo panels several aspects are notable. 1) The offset levels are the same. 2) The properties of the SS Gaussian\nagree to a few percent. 3) The amplitude of the AS peak\n\nD.\n\nConsequences of ZYAM\n\nZYAM subtraction with overestimated v2 values results in distorted azimuth correlations, including a misleading double-peaked away-side structure conventionally interpreted in terms of \"Mach cones\" [23, 24]. Oversubtraction of v22 occurs for three reasons: 1) v22 {2}\n(or v22 {EP }) includes large \"nonflow\" (minijet) contributions for all A-A centralities but especially for morecentral collisions, 2) v22 {4} can also include minijet contributions for more-central collisions and 3) factorization\nof the joint v22 (pt1 , pt2 ) distribution can be questioned\ngiven asymmetric (off-diagonal) pt cuts.\nFig. 8 (right panel) shows nominal jet signal S = R \u2212\n\n\f9\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nB as the points, illustrating the general form of morecentral dihadron correlations after ZYAM subtraction.\nThe original jet correlations are strongly reduced, and\nthe away-side peak has a minimum at \u03c0. The apparent\nreduction of jet correlations appears to confirm strong\njet quenching and parton thermalization. The AS peak\nstructure also suggests parton interaction with a dense,\nthermalized medium leading to shock-wave formation.\nThe form of the ZYAM-subtracted \"data\" in Fig. 8\n(right panel) depends only weakly on collision conditions,\nbecause v22 {2} is dominated by the m = 2 Fourier component of the SS peak. Its magnitude is therefore locked\nto the jet-peak amplitude, and all correlation structure\nscales up and down together with collision centrality.\nFigure 9 (left panel) demonstrates that maxima near\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0 \u00b1 1 resulting from ZYAM subtraction are an\ninevitable consequence of v2 oversubtraction for typical\nangular correlations from RHIC collisions. For a generic\nSS/AS peak combination in more-central A-A collisions\nseveral values of A2 (integer multiples of 2A0 v22 = 0.015)\nincluding zero (solid curve) are invoked in the subtraction. The persistence of apparently-displaced peaks at\nthe same locations is evident. Note the effect of ZYAM\nsubtraction even for v22 = 0 (solid curve and dotted line).\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0.1756E-03/ 18\n-0.7843E-01\n0.3572\n0.4445\n0.1687\n0.7846\n0.9709\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\nP6\n\n0.25\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nFIG. 9: Left: Demonstration of the effects of v2 oversubtraction.

Right:\nZYAM-subtracted distribution from Fig. 8 (right panel) fitted\nwith single SS Gaussian and two AS Gaussians located symmetrically about \u03c0. Common AS Gaussian amplitudes and\nwidths are P4 and P5. Displacements from \u03c0 are P6.\n\nFigure 9 (right panel) illustrates attempts to characterize the AS peak structure with two Gaussians [25].\nNominal medium-induced \"shoulder\" Gaussians are located near \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0 \u00b1 1. In some cases a fragmentationrelated \"head\" Gaussian is introduced at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0. The\nbold solid curve is a free fit with shoulder Gaussians allowed to vary in centroid, width and amplitude, but symmetrically about \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0. The detailed model fit can be\ncontrasted with the light (not bold) solid curve of Fig. 8\n(right panel), the \"right answer\" for these \"data.\"\nIn Figure 9 (right panel) the offset is allowed to vary,\nand the SS Gaussian amplitude is 0.36, closer to in-\n\nput value 0.50. If the offset were fixed at zero the SS\npeak amplitude would be 0.29, as in Fig. 8 (right panel).\nIf the correct fit model were used the original simulation parameters would be returned. This exercise reveals\nthe typical magnitude of systematic errors resulting from\nZYAM and v22 oversubtraction.\n\nE.\n\nSystematic errors and uncertainties\n\nZYAM subtraction uncertainties derive from uncertainties in offset B0 and v22 . The ZYAM offset uncertainty is assumed to result only from determining the\neffective minimum of the unsubtracted (raw) pair distribution, which is in turn assumed to be dominated by the\nstatistical error within a small azimuth interval [25, 26].\nThe present analysis demonstrates that the ZYAM assumption is contradicted by any distribution with overlapping peaks. The true ZYAM systematic uncertainty\nis indicated by the typical difference between a ZYAM\noffset value and that inferred from peak fitting as in this\nanalysis. The error can be large (up to 100% of true jet\ncorrelation amplitudes), leading to substantial underestimation of jet correlations and related hadron yields.\nv22 subtraction uncertainties are dominated by measurement uncertainties for marginal v22 (pt ) distributions.\nEspecially for more-peripheral or -central A-A collisions\nminijet contributions to v22 typically persist as large uncorrected systematic errors. v22 (pt ) is estimated by average (v22 {2} + v22 {4})/2 [33]. Where v22 {4} data are not\navailable (e.g., 0-5% central Au-Au) the approximation\nv22 {4} \u223c v22 {2}/4 is sometimes made [26]. The minimum\nvalue of v22 (e.g., for central Au-Au collisions) is then\nv22 {2}/2 if (ideal) v2 {4} is known (i.e., zero) or 5 v22 {2}/8\nif v2 {4} is not known.\nIn central (b = 0) A-A collisions v\u030422 = 0 and v22 {2} =\n\u03b42 . Thus, the minimum value of v22 assumed for background subtraction in central collisions is 1/2 the m = 2\nFourier component of the SS jet peak. Jet correlations\nare converted to \"nonflow\" which is subtracted from jet\ncorrelations. Consequently, jet yields can be greatly underestimated.\n\nVI.\n\nZYAM EXAMPLES FROM RHIC DATA\n\nTwo examples from ZYAM-based jet correlation analysis of RHIC 200 GeV Au-Au data are compared. ZYAM\nbackground subtraction is reversed to recover nominallyundistorted jet correlations. Free fits to data comparing\na Gaussian-dipole-quadrupole model with a GaussianGaussian-quadrupole model reveal consistent jet correlations in the two cases.\n\n\f10\nA.\n\nDihadron correlations from STAR\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n6\n\n26.80 / 27\n-0.6370E-02\n3.370\n0.5008\n3.180\n-0.5940E-03\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\n26.80 / 27\n-1.376\n3.364\n0.5001\n3.172\n-0.2166\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n0.25\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n1.75\n1.5\n1.25\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n\n0\n-0.25\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n36.72 / 27\n0.9785E-02\n0.2093\n0.2952\n0.1858E-01\n-0.2768E-02\n\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\n\n0.2\n\n4\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\n1/Ntrig dNpr/d\u2206\u03c6\n\nFig. 10 (upper left) shows data from Fig. 1 (upper left)\nof [26].

The relation of p-p to central Au-Au\ndata is quite different.

The\ncorresponding number from ZYAM subtraction in the\nupper-left panel is \u22122 P5 = 0.42, suggesting that the\nquadrupole component of the unsubtracted data was consistent with zero.\nFig. 10 (lower left) shows data from Fig. 1 (lower left)\nof [26] with the same fit model applied but with the associated pt cut raised to 2-4 GeV/c. While the AS peak\nis strongly reduced by the elevated associated-pt cut it is\nstill described by a dipole to the error limits of the data.\nFig. 10 (lower right) shows a two-Gaussian fit to the\np-p data from [26]. Comparing p-p and Au-Au data the\nSS peak width changes only slightly from p-p (0.4) to\ncentral Au-Au (0.5). The AS peak width doubles from pp (0.7) to Au-Au (\u223c 1.4). The latter should be expected\ndue to increased kt broadening of the AS peak, since\nthe mean participant-nucleon path length (as N-N binary\ncollisions) increases from 1 to 6 in central Au-Au [34].\nFigure 2 (upper panel) of [26] reviews the apparent\ncentrality systematics of SS and AS peak integrals. In\neither case an increasing trend for peripheral collisions\nappears to saturate for more-central collisions. However,\nfrom Fig. 10 (upper-right panel) we find that the 0-12%\nAu-Au/p-p ratio for both SS and AS is about six times\nthat for p-p or peripheral Au-Au collisions-greatly exceeding what is implied by the ZYAM subtraction. A\nsimilar reconsideration of [10] with reduced pt cuts might\nreveal that the \"away-side jet\" is still present, albeit with\naltered fragment (associated-particle) pt distribution.\n\nB.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nFIG. 10: Upper left: ZYAM-subtracted angular correlations\nfor 0-12% central 200 GeV Au-Au collisions (solid points) [26]\nwith free fit (bold solid curve) of SS Gaussian (dash-dotted\ncurve), AS dipole (dashed curve) and quadrupole (dotted\ncurve).

Lower right: Fit of two Gaussians plus offset to p-p\ndata.\n\nWithout the unsubtracted data we cannot determine\nthe original quadrupole component exactly. However,\nfrom information in the upper-right panel we can estimate what value of 2 A0 v22 was used in the subtraction.\n\nDihadron correlations from PHENIX\n\nFigure 11 (left panel) shows ZYAM-subtracted azimuth correlation data from Fig. 9 of [25] (points) corresponding to 2-3\u00d72-3 GeV/c pt cuts.

The increase can be appreciated visually in the right panel by comparing the solid points\nto the bold solid curve. Again, jet yields are strongly\nsuppressed by conventional ZYAM and v2 subtraction.\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nI first discuss problematic aspects of conventional analysis and interpretation of triggered azimuth correlations\nprior to background subtraction. I then consider the consequences of ZYAM and v2 oversubtraction: underestimation of jet yields and distortion of jet correlations.\nFinally, I discuss contrasts with untriggered angular correlations and a proper fit model.\n\nA.\n\nThe myth of the \"away-side\" jet\n\nIn the context of so-called triggered jet analysis conventional language refers to an \"away-side\" (AS) jet [22,\n25, 26]. AS azimuth correlation structure is attributed to\nsingle jets which are complementary to \"high-pt \" trigger\n\nparticles (i.e., proxies for trigger partons). The AS jet is\nsaid to broaden or, in the case of double-peaked structure, to manifest gluon bremsstrahlung radiation or Mach\nshocks [22]. The description implies that two classes of\njets exist: SS jets from the \"corona\" which are relatively\nintact (in-vacuum), and AS jets which suffer strong interactions with a dense medium (core), supporting the corecorona collision model. That language seems to represent\na misunderstanding of jets in A-A collisions.\nAS azimuth structure represents inter jet correlations,\nincluding not only intra jet structure (individual parton\nfragmentation) but parton-parton angular correlations as\nwell, especially kt contributions (e.g., dijet acoplanarity).\nkt generation by initial-state parton multiple scattering\nin A-A collisions may dominate AS correlations there.\nThe SS jet peak on azimuth reveals intra jet structure\nand represents all jets within an acceptance. Especially\nfor untriggered angular correlations any modifications to\njet structure (including Mach cones) should be manifested in the SS peak. Changes in AS correlations relative to the SS peak should first be attributed to the\nparton-parton relationship, dominated by kt production\nduring initial-state N-N (parton-parton) scattering.\nThe role of kt (nucleon-intrinsic and from initial-state\nparton multiple scattering) even in p-p collisions is quite\nsignificant. The AS peak width in p-p collisions is typically 50% larger than the SS peak, reflecting jet acoplanarity from the kt contribution to parton-parton transverse center-of-mass motion. The mean nucleon path\nlength (as N-N encounters) is six in central Au-Au, implying up to six-fold increase in kt variance or 2.5-fold\nincrease in AS peak width, which then accounts for typical AS widths \u03c3\u03c6 \u223c 1.3 \u2212 1.5 in central Au-Au collisions.\nB.\n\nConsequences of trigger/associated pt cuts\n\nApplication of pt cuts to emulate jet reconstruction\ncan strongly bias jet-related azimuth correlations, leading\nto misinterpretations. To interpret the consequences of\npt cuts correctly a valid model of parton fragmentation\n(fragmentation functions or FFs in vacuum and medium)\nand parton-parton correlations (kt effects) is required.\nFor single-parton fragmentation (e.g., \"in-vacuum\"\njets) in 200 GeV p-p collisions the following trends are\nobserved [13, 18, 19]: 1) The peak (mode) of FFs occurs in 1-2 GeV/c for all parton energies from 3 GeV\nup to several hundred GeV [35]. 2) p-p FFs are strongly\nsuppressed below 1 GeV/c compared to jets in e+ -e\u2212 collisions. 3) About half the fragments from minimum-bias\njets or \"minijets\" in p-p collisions, with most-probable\nparton energy = 3 GeV, appear below 1 GeV/c.\nSome implications of those systematics are: 1) A typical trigger pt cut at 4 GeV/c eliminates most scattered\npartons, since pt,parton > pt,trigger , the mode of the parton spectrum is near 3 GeV and the spectrum is falling\n\u221d pt\u22127.5 . 2) FF suppression at smaller fragment momentum in p-p collisions already narrows jet angular correla-\n\n\f12\ntions relative to in-vacuum jets from e-e collisions. 3) An\nassociated pt cut at 2 GeV/c (e.g., [10]) eliminates most\nof the FF for any parton energy, further narrowing jet\nangular correlations (only the \"tip\" of the jet survives).\nA trigger pt cut biases the underlying parton spectrum\nto larger energies and so could in principle be useful for\nsystematic energy-loss studies. However, the trigger cut\nalso biases the associated kt distribution, especially in\nmore-central Au-Au collisions where accumulated kt can\nbe large. Aside from jet (parton) acoplanarity (kt broadening of the AS azimuth peak) a unique consequence of\nthe trigger cut is a kt bias in which the parton-pair kt sum\nis preferentially oriented nearly parallel to the triggerparton momentum, thereby increasing the trigger-parton\nmomentum and decreasing the partner momentum in the\nlaboratory frame. Such kt bias can give an impression of\nlarge AS energy loss in a dense medium when the SS/AS\nmomentum asymmetry is actually due to initial-state kt .\nIn-medium modification of FFs in more-central AuAu collisions can be described by alteration of the splitting process [36], wherein energy is not lost from a jet,\nis instead redistributed on pt to a degree depending on\nAu-Au centrality. More jet-correlated fragments appear\nat smaller pt [19]. The effect is observed in untriggered\ntwo-particle correlations, including a sharp transition at\nintermediate Au-Au centrality between unmodified p-p\njets and strongly-modified but still intact jets in morecentral Au-Au [14, 19]. Modification of FFs in central\nAu-Au collisions can transport much of the jet below an\nassociated-particle pt cut interval, giving the false impression that back-to-back parton pairs are suppressed,\ni.e., that one parton is \"thermalized\" in a dense medium.\n\nC.\n\nConsequences of ZYAM and v2 oversubtraction\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that for any case where\nthere is significant SS and AS peak overlap the ZYAM\nassumption discards a significant fraction of the true jet\nyield. In more-central collisions up to 90% of the jet yield\nmay be discarded as a result of ZYAM plus v22 oversubtraction, as in Fig. 11 (AS peak). Oversubtraction of v22 ,\nwhich is guaranteed by conventional subtraction methods, further reduces the apparent jet yield and introduces\nstrong distortions in AS correlations. The resulting distortions can be misinterpreted as evidence that a large\nfraction of scattered partons is thermalized in a dense\nmedium, and that novel QCD phenomena result.\nIn [22] the double-peaked AS structure induced in\ntwo-particle correlations is duplicated in a more-complex\nthree-particle correlation analysis. The analysis is intended to demonstrate that relative to a trigger particle\nsome pairs of AS particles are widely separated by a characteristic angle which might imply conical emission from\na parton passing through a dense medium, as in Machcone shock waves [23, 24].\nIt was found that the distance of AS \"Mach peaks\"\nfrom \u03c0 (\"cone opening angle\") does not depend on A-\n\nA centrality or associated-particle pt . The fixed opening angle has been interpreted to measure the speed of\nsound in the QCD medium [23, 24]. Yet the properties\nof a true QCD medium ought to depend strongly on A-A\ncentrality (e.g., compared to p-p collisions). The present\nanalysis indicates that the AS double peak is an artifact\nhaving a fixed form for simple algebraic reasons, with no\nrelation to collision dynamics or a QCD medium.\n\nD.\n\nUntriggered 2D angular autocorrelations\n\nUntriggered 2D angular autocorrelations [12, 13, 14,\n15, 16] differ from conventional triggered dihadron\ncorrelation analysis in several ways: 1) Absent trigger/associated pt cuts the entire fragment yield from the\nentire minimum-bias parton spectrum is measured. 2)\nNo ad hoc (ZYAM) offset is imposed; the offset is inferred from free fits to correlation structure. 3) Model\nfits impose only minimal a priori assumptions which are\nsubsequently tested with data. 4) No external v2 measurement is imposed; an independent quadrupole component is inferred directly from the model fit. 5) The SS\npeak is uniquely isolated in the 2D fit due to its \u03b7 dependence. 6) Remaining structure is described by modelindependent azimuth Fourier amplitudes. The measured\nquadrupole amplitude serves as an upper limit to any\nnonjet quadrupole component.\nUnsubtracted dihadron correlations for pairs within\nspecific pt cut bins serve as the best measurement of\njoint distribution v22 (pt1 , pt2 ) simultaneously with corresponding jet structure. ZYAM subtraction disregards\ndirect v22 measurements, instead invokes products of\nv2 (pt ) marginal values of questionable accuracy (large jet\nor \"nonflow\" contribution likely). Conventional v2 (pt )\nmeasurements\nfor 0-5% central Au-Au collisions imply\np\nv2 (pt1 ) v2 (pt2 ) \u223c 0.06 \u2212 0.07, whereas untriggered 2D\nangular correlations return v2 \u2264 0.01. The difference in\nquadrupole amplitude v22 is a factor 30-50.\nThe SS 2D Gaussian is tightly constrained by the 2D\nfit. Its amplitude is not available, as in a 1D fit, to offset\ndistortions of the AS peak imposed by v22 (quadrupole)\noversubtraction. No double-peaked AS structure has been\nobserved in 2D angular autocorrelations.\n\nE.\n\nRecommended procedures\n\nWhatever the subsequent analysis, unmodified dihadron pair distributions with absolute pair numbers per\ncollision event should be published for all collision systems. A neutral presentation method for untriggered\nangular correlations normalizes the number of mixed\npairs (reference) to the number of sibling (same-event)\npairs [12, 14]. The integral of the net-pair distribution (number of \"correlated\" pairs) is made zero by construction to avoid suggesting that the net-pair number\nis known a priori. The true offset can be estimated sub-\n\n\f13\n\nI have examined the validity of jet structure isolated from dihadron azimuth correlations by combinatoric background subtraction based on ZYAM (zero yield\nat minimum) and conventional v2 (pt ) measurements.\nSimulations of ideal correlation data compared to published RHIC data demonstrate that in some cases ZYAM\nplus v2 subtraction produces substantial distortions and\nunderestimation of jet yields.\nCombinatoric correlation analysis is a convenient\nmethod to access jet correlations in A-A collisions, but\nisolation of jet structure from the non-jet background\npresents technical challenges. The conventional background model includes a constant offset B0 and an \"elliptic flow\" contribution nominally of the form v22 (pt1 , pt2 ).\nThe ZYAM principle is invoked to determine B0 , but\nZYAM has no basis in conventional distribution analy-\n\nsis. The ZYAM method is defended by arguing that the\ndetailed shapes of jet correlations are not known a priori. Possible radiation effects and/or medium modifications to fragmentation could distort jet-related structure.\nZYAM is then said to reduce systematic errors arising\nfrom uncertainties about jet peak shapes.\nIn this study I use simulations with known peak structures to demonstrate that the ZYAM procedure can produce large systematic errors. Systematic distortions may\nbe much larger than any effects due to peak-shape uncertainties. Especially for more-central A-A collisions the\nZYAM assumption leads to substantial underestimation\nof jet correlation amplitudes, interpreted in turn to imply\nlarge parton energy loss in a thermalized dense medium.\nI demonstrate that for typical correlations from RHIC\ncollisions simple peak models adequately describe jet correlation data. Intrajet correlations (same-side peak) are\nwell-described by a Gaussian. In special cases a modified\nGaussian could accommodate width fluctuations due to\nradiation effects. Interjet correlations (awayside peak,\nback-to-back jets) are well-described by a Gaussian or,\nif the AS width is large (typical), by an azimuth dipole\ncomponent. That model permits accurate determination\nof the background offset value, in contrast to ZYAM.\nConventional measurements of v2 (pt ) are susceptible to\n\"nonflow\" (jet correlations). In the conventional method\nof dihadron correlation analysis v22 (pt1 , pt2 ) is overestimated, especially in more-central A-A collisions. As a\nresult of v22 oversubtraction the same-side jet peak is further reduced, and the away-side peak acquires a minimum at its center. Away-side distortions have been interpreted as manifestations of Mach shocks arising from\nsound propagation in a thermalized dense medium.\nAs a result of ZYAM subtraction the impression may\nbe formed that most partons are stopped in a thermalized dense medium (\"opaque core\"), that shock waves\nmay be produced in the same medium as partons traverse the medium, giving rise to anomalous AS structure.\nIn contrast untriggered angular correlations described by\nfree model fits reveal that jet yields increase even faster\nthan binary collisions in more-central Au-Au collisions.\nThere is no isolated \"away-side\" jet. Away-side structure\nis undistorted and reflects jet-jet (parton-parton) correlations. Jets are modified in more-central collisions, but\nall partons survive as final-state correlation structure.\nThis work was supported in part by the Office of Science of the U.S. DoE under grant DE-FG03-97ER41020.\n\n[1] C.

Mean event multiplicities for\naccepted particles should be included in the presentation.\nThe fit model should be as simple as possible (minimum parameter number) yet physically interpretable.\nPeaks can be distinguished from background by model\nfits as long as the peaks are resolved according to the\nRayleigh criterion (sum of r.m.s. widths significantly less\nthan peak separation \u03c0, which is typically satisfied for\nazimuth correlations). The Gaussian shape for the SS\npeak may be questioned in isolated cases (cf. Sec. IV C),\nbut for most cases of relevance to RHIC data the 1D (on\nazimuth) or 2D Gaussian model should be adequate.\nFor higher pt cuts and/or p-p collisions the AS azimuth\npeak may be described by a Gaussian. For untriggered\ncorrelations and/or for more-central Au-Au collisions the\nAS peak width increases substantially, the higher Fourier\ncomponents of the AS Gaussian decrease, and only a few\nterms of a Fourier series may be required. In the asymptotic limit (e.g., \u03c3\u03c6 \u2265 1.3) periodic AS peak structure\nsimplifies to a pure dipole plus constant.\nIn intermediate cases fits with both models (two\nGaussians+quadrupole, Gaussian+dipole+quadrupole),\nincluding a sextupole in the Fourier decomposition, provide optimal descriptions and estimates of systematic uncertainty. Fits should be performed over the unbroken 2\u03c0\ninterval to respect and enforce periodicity of peak arrays.\nAnalysis of SS or AS subintervals independently is inconsistent with discrete Fourier series and can be misleading.\nVIII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\f14\n(2006).\n[9] K.
