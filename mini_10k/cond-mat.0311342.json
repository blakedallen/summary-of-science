MnNi seems to be a promising alloy for exchange coupling to NiFe\ndue to its large exchange coupling field, its good corrosion resistance and its\nhigh blocking temperature [1]. Irreversible measurements (such as hysteresis\nloop) are commonly used to quantify the unidirectional exchange coupling in\nF/AF bilayers. Reversible experimental techniques, such as ac susceptiblity\nand ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and Brillouin light scattering (BLS) are\nalso employed (for a review see [2]). These techniques lead to different values\nfor the exchange field [3]. Most of the reversible techniques involve a constant\nfrequency excitation and only a few papers [4] deal with the measurement\nof the complex susceptibility of F/AF bilayers in a broad frequency range.\nThe aim of this paper is to probe, with the measurement of the complex permeabiliy frequency spectrum, the exchange anisotropy of NiFe/MnNi bilayers\nwith different Mn concentrations.\n\n2\n\nExperiments\n\nSubstrate\\Ni81 F e19 280\u00c5\\Mnx Ni100\u2212x 800\u00c5 bilayers were grown on Corning\nGlass substrate by RF diode sputtering using a standard Z 550 Leybold equipment with a magnetic field of 300 Oe applied during deposition to induce an\nuniaxial anisotropy. The background pressure was lower than 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 mbar.\nNi chips were homogeneously added to a four inches diameter Mn target in\n2\n\n\forder to get films in the Mn composition range 35-80 percent. The chemical\nhomogeneity was verified by Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA) on several points of the sample. The Mn composition variation is about one percent\non the entire sample. After deposition, samples were annealed in a magnetic\nfield of 1000 Oe, aligned with the easy axis of the film, at 300o C for 5 hours\nto induce the exchange field. The magnetic properties such as the saturation magnetization Ms were obtained from magnetization loops (M-H loops)\nmeasured at room temperature using a VSM. The complex frequency spectra\nof the bilayers were measured from 30 MHz to 6 GHz using a broad band\nmethod. The method is based on the measurement, by a network analyser,\nof the reflection coefficient S11 of a single turn coil loaded by the film under\ntest [5]. Because of the topography of the applied ac field (hac ) in the coil, the\npermeability can be measured for different orientations of the exciting field in\nrelation to the in-plane anisotropy.\n\n3\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWe consider a F layer, with an uniaxial anisotropy field Hk along the easy axis,\nsubmitted to an unidirectionnal exchange field Hex , induced by the exchange\ncoupling along the easy axis, and to an applied ac field hac applied perpendicular to the easy axis. The initial susceptibility measured along the ac field is\ngiven by [6] \u03c7 = MS /(Hex + Hk ). \u03c7/MS is the initial slope of the hysteresis\nloop when measured perpendicular to the easy axis. Hex is determined by the\nshift of the center of magnetization loop. Hk is extracted from the M-H loops\nmeasured perpendicular to the easy axis (previous equation).\nIn Ni81 F e19 /Mnx Ni100\u2212x bilayers the exchange field depends strongly on the\n3\n\n\fMn concentration and the growth conditions [7]. We have grown several bilayers, whose composition varies from 35 to 80 percent of Mn. Before annealing,\nfor all the samples, only the soft magnetic behavior of NiFe was detected.\nAfter annealing and above 40 percent of Mn, the MnNi has gone though a\nParamagnetic-AF phase transition. The M-H loops are shifted and typical of a\nF/AF coupling. The NiFe layer is still showing an in-plane uniaxial anisotropy.\nmes\nWe have measured Hkmes and Hex\non samples with different Mn compositions.\n\nThe results are presented in Table 1. One can observe that the saturation magnetization of the NiFe layer decreased after annealing. This may be attributed\nto interfacial diffusion leading to the existence of an interdiffused AF ternary\nalloy FeMnNi at the NiFe-MnNi interface [7]. It can be seen that the values\nof the exchange field increase as a function of the Mn composition. The values of the anisotropy field Hkmes (up to 3 kA/m) are larger than those of the\nuncoupled annealed NiFe layer, and these values change significantly with the\nMn composition.\n\nWe have measured the complex permeability spectra of the bilayers before and\nafter annealing for the exciting field applied perpendicular to the easy axis.\nThe results are presented in fig.1 for three samples and the major results for\nall the samples are presented in fig.2 . Before annealing (as grown), there is no\nmagnetic interaction between the NiFe and the MnNi layer. The permeability\nspectra are typical of damping by spin rotation processes in a NiFe layer\n[8]. For the annealed samples, when the exchange and the anisotropy fields\nincrease, the level of the real part of the permeability \u03bc\u2032 (0) at low frequency\ndecreases and the roll off frequency increases. We can also observe that the\nimaginary part of the complex permeability \u03bc\u2032\u2032 shows a lower resonance peak,\na higher resonance frequency fres (up to 3.5 GHz) and a wider resonance peak\n4\n\n\fas the exchange field increases.\nIn a previous paper [9], we have presented an analytic calculation of the frequency dependent complex permeability tensor of a thin ferromagnetic film\nwith uniaxial in-plane anisotropy, submitted to an external exciting field using\nthe Landau-Lifshitz (LL) theory [10]. Using this calculation, we have obtained\nthe components of the complex permeability tensor which are a function of\nMs , the total effective field Hef f , the frequency f of the exciting field and\nthe phenomenological damping constant \u03b1. The theoretical value of \u03bc\u2032 (0) at\nlow frequency is found to be 1+(Ms /Hef f ) and, as observed, the decrease\nof the saturation magnetization and the enhancement of the effective field\nmes\n(Hkmes + Hex\n) lead to a reduction of the level of \u03bc\u2032 (0). The resonance fre-\n\nquency fres is found to be (1/2\u03c0)\u00d7\u03b3(Hef f (Hef f + Ms ))1/2 . In our samples the\nmes\nenhancement of Hef\nf is prevalent and lead to the enhancement of fres . Fig.\n\n3 shows an example of the comparison between theoretical and experimental\ncomplex permeability spectra when the exciting field is applied perpendicular\nto the easy axis. The results are presented for an as-grown sample and for\none exchange-biased sample (NiFe/Mn46 Ni54 ). For the other samples the fit\nparameters are presented in Table 1.\nmes\nIn a first step of calculations, the values the effective field (Hkmes + Hex\n) and\n\nMsmes are taken from static measurements and the value of the damping pames\nrameter is fitted. For the as-grown sample (Hex\n= 0), experimental results\n\nare in good agreement with the theoretical prediction as observed in fig. 3\n(solid curve (a)). The value of the fitted damping parameter (0.012) is typical of the one obtained on a NiFe single layer [8]. For the exchange biased\nbilayers, the level of the permeability is in agreement with the theoretical values but the calculated resonance frequency is lower than the measured one\n5\n\n\f(Fig.3 solid curve (a)). In a second step we have computed the complex perf it\nmeability where the effective field was taken as a fit parameter (Hef\nf ). The\n\nresult is presented in figure 3 (solid curve (b)). It can be seen that the experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The fitted\nvalues of the effective field in the exchange biased bilayers are higher that\nthose obtained from M-H loop measurements. Moreover, one can see that the\nbroadening of the experimental spectrum of \u03bc\u2032\u2032 is associated with the increasing of the damping parameter from 0.012 up to 0.035 (Table 1). It may be\nexplained as follows. The experimental data should be not interpreted with\na phenomenological model of fixed moment along the easy anisotropy direction. One should take into account a local variation of the exchange field at\nthe F/AF interface. This local variation may be due to interdiffusion at the\nNiFe-MnNi interface. This complex magnetic structure at the interface may\nbe grains of NiFe exchange coupled with antiferromagnetic NiFeMn \"coating\" on their surface [11]. These broadenings have been observed with FMR\nand BLS measurements and attributed to a relaxation mechanism based on\ntwo-magnon scattering processes due to the local fluctuation of the exchange\ncoupling caused by interface roughness [12]. In conclusion, we have shown\nthat it is possible to describe the magnetization dynamics of exchange biased\nbilayers with the LL theory. Effective fields are extracted from complex permeability spectra and are much larger than the ones obtained from a hysteresis\nloop measurements. The high values of the effective field associated with the\nenhancement of the damping parameter may be associated with interdiffusion\nin the bilayers.\nThis work was partially supported by PRIR program of Region Bretagne\n\n6\n\n\fReferences\n\n[1] T.
