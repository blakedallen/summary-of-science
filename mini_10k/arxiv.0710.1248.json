PART I.\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\nAbstract. The Edelman-Jamison problem is to characterize those abstract\nconvex geometries that are representable by a set of points in the plane. We\nshow that some natural modification of the Edelman-Jamison problem is equivalent to the well known N P -hard order type problem.\n\n1. Introduction\nA finite closure space (J, \u2212) is called a convex geometry (see, for example, [5]),\nif it satisfies the anti-exchange axiom, i.e.\n/ A imply that y \u2208\n/ A \u222a {x}\nx \u2208 A \u222a {y} and x \u2208\nfor all x 6= y in J and all closed A \u2286 J.\nGiven a closure space, one can associate with it the lattice of closed sets Cl(J, \u2212);\nvice versa, every finite lattice L represents the lattice of closed sets of a closure\nspace defined on the set J of join-irreducible elements of L. In particular, convex\ngeometries correspond to locally lower distributive lattices which by definition are\nsuch that for each nonzero element x the lattice generated by all lower covers of x\nis Boolean. It is well known [9, p.19] that lower local distributivity is equivalent\nto the conjunction of lower semimodularity and join-semidistributivity. The latter\nproperty is defined by\n(\u2200x, y, z \u2208 L) (x \u2228 y = x \u2228 z\n\n\u21d2\n\nx \u2228 y = x \u2228 (y \u2227 z))\n\nJoin semidistributivity is clearly inherited by sublattices, but lower distributivity\ngenerally isn't.\nThe following classical example of finite convex geometries shows how they\nearned their name. Given a set of points X in Euclidean space Rn , one defines\na closure operator on X as follows: for any Y \u2286 X, Y = ch(Y ) \u2229 X, where\nch stands for the convex hull. One easily verifies that such an operator satisfies\nthe anti-exchange axiom. Thus, (X, \u2212) is a finite convex geometry. Denote by\nCo(Rn , X) the closure lattice of this closure space, namely, the lattice of convex\nsets relative to X.\nThe current work was motivated by [11] and the following problem raised in [2]:\nwhich lattices can be embedded into Co(Rn , X) for some n \u2208 \u03c9 and some finite\nX \u2286 Rn ? Is this the class of all finite join-semidistributive lattices?

Or,\nequivalently, what finite convex geometries can be realized as the convex sets relative\nto some finite point configurations in n-space?\nThis is essentially the\nProblem 1.1. Edelman-Jamison Problem[5]:\nCharacterize those convex geometries that are realizable by suitable\npoint configuration in Rn .\nWe provide the partial solution to this problem for n = 2 in the second part of\nour paper. Here we discuss the connection of the Edelman-Jamison Problem to the\nOrderTypeProblem.\nIn combinatorial geometry, order types were introduced as a tool to capture\nessential features of point configurations. Assuming that a configuration is in a\ngeneral position, i.e. none of three distinct points are on one line, one defines an\norder-type of this configuration as a function of orientation of triples of distinct\npoints.\nThe Order Type Problem asks whether a given function from the triples of nonequal members from a given finite set J into the two element set {\u22121, 1} can be\nrealized as the orientation of triples of |J| points on the plane in the general position.\nIt is known that the Order-Type problem is NP-hard.\nWe show that point configurations that are equivalent as order types are also\nequivalent as convex geometries. On the other hand, there are plenty of point\nconfigurations that produce the same convex geometry while being non-equivalent\nas order types: see Example 3.5 and the follow-up series of examples described in\nProposition 4.5. In fact, we show in Corollary 4.6 that the number of non-equivalent\norder types corresponding to the same convex geometry cannot be polynomially\nbounded.\nOn the other hand, knowing the convex geometry formed by a given configuration, and the circular clock-wise order of the points in the outside layer of this\nconfiguration, allows to determine the order type uniquely, see Theorem 6.3. Thus,\nfor the convex geometries that enjoy a unique clock-wise circular order of their\nextreme points in each point configuration realizing them, the Edelman-Jamison\nProblem is polynomially equivalent to the Order-Type Problem.\n2. Convex 4-geometries\nLet (X, \u223c) be the convex geometry induced by a finite set of points X \u2286 R2\nin general position. Thus its lattice of closed subspaces is Co(R2 , X). A rooted\ntriangle of (X, \u223c) is a pair (T, ~x) such that T \u222a {~x} \u2286 X, |T | = 3, ~x \u2208 Te \u2212 T\n(thus ~x is in the interior of the triangle spanned by T ). Notice that a fixed T may\ngive rise to many rooted triangles (T, ~x), (T, ~y ), * * * in (X, \u223c). Since each polygon\nis partitioned by triangles, the closure operator Y 7\u2192 Ye is determined1 by the set\nRT (X) of all rooted triangles via\nYe = Y \u222a {~x \u2208 X| \u2203(T, ~x) \u2208 RT (X) with T \u2282 Y }.\n1Put in other words, the family {T \u2192 {x}| (T, x) \u2208 RT (X)} is an implicational base in the\n\nsense of [12].\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n3\n\nA convex geometry (J, \u2212) which is isomorphic2 to the kind (X, \u223c) discussed\nabove (X \u2286 R2 suitable), will be called realizable.\nWe need some preliminaries in order to formulate a necessary condition for being\nrealizable.\nCall a subset D of any closure space (J, \u2212) dependent if there is x \u2208 D with x \u2208\nD \u2212 {x}. An inclusion-minimal dependent set C is often called a circuit (adopting\nmatroid terminology). It easily follows from the anti-exchange axiom that in a\ncircuit C of a convex geometry (J, \u2212) there is a unique element x = x(C) of C, call\nit the root of C, such that x \u2208 C \u2212 {x}.\nIt is not hard to show that one way to obtain a circuit with root x is as follows.\nIf T \u2286 J \u2212 {x} is inclusion-minimal with x \u2208 T , then C := T \u222a {x} is a circuit.\nLet Circ(J, \u2212) be the set of all circuits of a convex geometry (J, \u2212). Thus, if (J, \u2212)\nhappens to be realizable by some X \u2286 R2 , then Circ(J, \u2212) bijectively corresponds\nto RT (X) via C 7\u2192 (C \u2212 {x(C)}, x(C)).\nIn particular, every realizable (J, \u2212) is a convex 4-geometry in that |C| = 4 for\nall C \u2208 Circ(J, \u2212). It is handy to call a pair (T, x), T any 3-element set with\nx 6\u2208 T , a quasi rooted triangle.\nThe following proposition is reminiscent of [4] Theorem 7:\nProposition 2.1. Let QRT be a family of candidate rooted triangles of a set J.\nThen the following are equivalent:\n(i) There is a convex 4-geometry (J, \u2212) such that (T, a) 7\u2192 T \u222a{a} is a bijection\nfrom QRT onto Circ(J, \u2212).\n(ii) Dietrich's axiom: For all (T1 , a), (T2 , b) \u2208 QRT with a \u2208 T2 there is\n(T3 , b) \u2208 QRT with T3 \u2286 (T1 \u222a T2 ) \u2212 {a, b}. In words: Each triangle having\na vertex \"colliding\" with another triangle's root, can be locally shifted whilst\nkeeping its root (Figure 1).\nT3\n\nb\na\n\nT2\n\nb\n\nor\n\nT1\n\na\nT1\n\nT2\nT3\n\nFigure 1.\nProof. : As to (i) \u21d2 (ii), let T1 \u222a{a} and T2 \u222a{b} be circuits of any convex geometry\nwith roots a, b respectively. Let T := (T1 \u222a T2 ) \u2212 {a, b}. Then a \u2208 T \u222a {b} and\nb \u2208 T \u222a {a}. By the anti-exchange property either a \u2208 T or b \u2208 T takes place.\nIn both cases b \u2208 T . Let T3 \u2286 T be minimial with b \u2208 T 3 . Then, as mentioned\npreviously, T3 \u222a {b} is a circuit.\n2Any two closure spaces are isomorphic if there is a bijection mapping one onto the other,\nwhile preserving the closure operator.\n\n\f4\n\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\n\nAs to (ii) \u21d2 (i), we adhere to Figure 2 and first define\nA := A \u222a {a| \u2203(T, a) \u2208 QRT with T \u2286 A}\nObviously this yields a monotone and extensive operator P(J) 7\u2192 P(J). Suppose\nwe had A 6= A for some A \u2286 J. Picking b \u2208 A \u2212 A there would be some (T2 , b) in\nQRT with T2 \u2286 A (and trivially T2 6\u2286 A). We may assume that among all possible\nT2 's of this kind our T2 minimizes |T2 \u2212 A|. Pick any a \u2208 T2 \u2212 A. Since a \u2208 A,\nthere is a (T1 , a) in QRT with T1 \u2286 A. By (ii) there is a (T3 , b) in QRT with\nT3 \u2286 (T1 \u222a T2 ) \u2212 {a, b}. Since T3 \u2286 A, and since T3 \u2212 A \u2286 T2 \u2212 (A \u222a {a}) implies\n|T3 \u2212 A| < |T2 \u2212 A|, we get a contradiction to the minimality of T2 . Hence our\noperator Y 7\u2192 Y is idempotent, i.e. a closure operator. It is clear that the circuits\nwith respect to this closure operator are precisely the members of QRT .\n\nT2\n\nA\nA\n\nT1\n\na\nT3\n\nFigure 2.\nIn order to verify the anti-exchange property, suppose there was a closed A \u2286 J\nand distinct elements a, b 6\u2208 A such that a \u2208 A \u222a {b} and b \u2208 A \u222a {a}. Then there\nare (T1 , a) and (T2 , b) in QRT with T1 \u2286 A \u222a {b} and T2 \u2286 A \u222a {a}. By (ii) there\nis a (T3 , b) in QRT with T3 \u2286 (T1 \u222a T2 ) \u2212 {a, b}. This implies T3 \u2286 A, and whence\nthe contradiction b \u2208 A = A.\n\u0003\nIn view of Proposition 2.1 we adopt from now on the notation (J, RT ) rather\nthan (J, \u2212) for convex 4-geometries. Here RT is a set of rooted triangles (based on\nJ) which satisfies Dietrich's axiom.\n2.1. Layers of convex 4-geometries. For any finite convex geometry (J, \u2212) one\ncan define, recursively, the family of subsets Li \u2286 J, i = 0, 1, . . . , called layers. Let\nL0 = {x \u2208 J : x 6\u2208 J\\{x}} be the set of extreme points of (J, \u2212).\nS\nAssumeSnow that the layers L0 , . . . , Ln\u22121 are defined and J 6= i<n Li . Let\nJn = J\\ i<n Li . There is a naturally defined convex geometry (Jn , \u2212) whose\nclosure operator is the restriction of closure operator of (J, \u2212) on Jn . Then Ln =\n{x \u2208 Jn : x 6\u2208 Jn \\{x}} is the set of extreme points of geometry (J\nSn , \u2212).\nOne can proceed with defining the layers L0 , . . . , Lk until J\\ i\u2264k Li = \u2205. This\ndefines the complete family of layers of (J, \u2212). We will call the number q(J) := k\nthe depth of convex geometry. Besides, layer L0 is called the outermost layer, Lk\nis the innermost layer.\nWe collect the easy facts about layers in the following statement:\nProposition 2.2. Let L0 , . . . , Lk be the complete family of layers of the\nconvex geometry (J, \u2212).\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n5\n\n(1) L\nSi \u2229 Lj = \u2205, when i 6= j;\n(2) i\u2264k Li = J;\n(3) Li+1 , . . . , Lk \u2286 Li , for any i < k.\nThe proof follows easily from the well-known fact about convex geometries that\nJ = L0 .\n3. Order types\n2\n\nFor all noncolinear ~x, ~y , ~z \u2208 R define\n\u001a\n1, if ~x, ~y, ~z are positively oriented (anticlockwise)\nsign(~x, ~y , ~z ) :=\n\u22121, if ~x, ~y, ~z are negatively oriented\nOf course, that could be defined in terms of determinants, but there is no need to\ndo so. Recall that sign(~x, ~y, ~z ) = sign(~z, ~x, ~y) = sign(~y , ~z, ~x) (cyclic permutability)\nand sign(~x, ~y , ~z ) = \u2212sign(~x, ~z, ~y).\nFor a set J let J[3] be the set of all triplets (a, b, c) with distinct a, b, c in J.\nFollowing [3] we call two point configuration X, Y \u2286 R2 equivalent if there is a\nbijection F : X \u2192 Y which preserves the orientation of all triples in X. Following\n[7], call t : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121} an order type on J, if there is a function f : J \u2192 R2\nsuch that for all (a, b, c) in J[3] one has\nt(a, b, c) = sign(f (a), f (b), f (c))\nThe point configuration X := f (J) is then said to realize the order type t. In\nbrief, t is an order type, if it represents the orientation of triples of some suitable\npoint configuration. If a particular f is relevant, we shall write t = tf .\nReminiscent to equivalent point configurations we declare two order types t1 and\nt2 on J equivalent, if there is a bijection \u03b4 : J \u2192 J such that t2 = t1 \u25e6 \u03b4. Here\n\u03b4 : J[3] \u2192 J[3] is the canonic map induced by \u03b4. A minute's thought confirms:\nCorollary 3.1. Two order types t1 and t2 on J are equivalent if and only if any\ntwo corresponding realizing point configurations X1 and X2 are equivalent.\nLet us call two order types t1 , t2 weakly equivalent if t1 is equivalent to either t2\nor \u2212t2 . Accordingly weakly equivalent point configurations are defined.\nProposition 3.2. Any two weakly equivalent point configurations X, Y \u2286 R2 induce isomorphic convex geometries.\nProof. Let ~x1 , ~x2 , ~x3 , ~x \u2208 X be distinct.

Here is an appetizer.\nProposition 3.3. For each convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) the following are equivalent:\n(i) (J, RT ) is realizable\n(ii) There is an order type t on J such that for all distinct a, b, c, d in J one\nhas:\n({a, b, c}, d) \u2208 RT\n\n\u21d4\n\nt(a, b, c) = t(d, b, c) = t(a, d, c) = t(a, b, d)\n\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). If f : J \u2192 R2 is a realization of (J, RT ), then t := tf does the\njob since for all a, b, c, d \u2208 J:\n({a, b, c}, d) \u2208 RT\n\n\u21d4\n\nf (d) \u2208 ch({f (a), f (b), f (c)})\n\n(1)\n\n\u21d4\n\nt(a, b, c) = t(d, b, c) = t(a, d, c) = t(a, b, d)\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). Let t = tf be an order type as in (ii). Then f : J \u2192 R2 is a realization\nof (J, RT ) because for all distinct a, b, c, d in J one has:\n({a, b, c}, d) \u2208 RT \u21d4 t(a, b, c) = t(d, b, c) = t(a, d, c) = t(a, b, d)\n\n(1)\n\n\u21d4\n\nf (d) \u2208 ch({f (a), f (b), f (c)}).\n\n\u0003\n\nLet us illustrate these concepts with two examples.\nExample 3.4. Consider these two point configurations:\n\nx1\n\nx2\n\ny4\n\ny\n\nx4\n\nx3\n\ny1\n\ny2\n\n3\n\nFigure 3.\nThe labeling suggests that square Y arises from square X by reflecting the latter\non its horizontal axis of symmetry. Thus, since F (xi ) := yi is an order reversing\nbijection, the point configurations X and Y are weakly equivalent. Rephrasing it\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n7\n\nin terms of order types, put J := {1, 2, 3, 4} and define ti : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} (i = 1, 2)\nby\nt1 (i, j, k) := sign(xi , xj , xk ), t2 (i, j, k) := sign(yi , yj , yk )\nThen t2 = \u2212t1 , i.e. t1 , t2 are weakly equivalent order types (putting \u03b4 = id).

Put another way,\nlooking at X from \"below the sheet\" yields Y . Hence the two point configurations\nare again weakly equivalent. However, this time we will not succeed in finding a\nG : X \u2192 Y that establishes the equivalence of X and Y . It suffices to show that\n(2)\n\nG(xi ) = yi for any equivalence G : X \u2192 Y\n\nbecause then e.g. sign(y1 , y2 , y3 ) = 1 6= \u22121 = sign(x1 , x2 , x3 ). In order to see\n(2), recall from Proposition 3.2 that an equivalence G : X \u2192 Y is an isomorphism\nof convex 4-geometries, i.e. preserves rooted triangles. Because the number of roots\ninside the triangles {x1 , x2 , x3 }, {x1 , x2 , x4 }, {x1 , x3 , x4 }, {x2 , x3 , x4 } is 4, 1, 2, 5 respectively (and dito for Y ), it follows that G maps {x1 , x2 , x) onto {y1 , y2 , y3 }, and\nso on. A moment's thought confirms that this forces (2).\nThe following example shows that there exist point configurations that are not\nweakly equivalent yet yield isomorphic convex 4-geometries.\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\f8\n\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\n\nc2\nc1\n\nc'2\n\nc'1\ny'\n\ny\nj'\nj\n\ni\ni'\nx\n\nb2\n\nx'\nb'1\n\nb1\n\nb'2\n\nFigure 5.\n\nExample 3.5.\nLet L = {b1 , b2 , c1 , c2 , i, j, x, y} and L\u2032 = {b\u20321 , b\u20322 , c\u20321 , c\u20322 , i\u2032 , j \u2032 , x\u2032 , y \u2032 } be two 8-point\nconfigurations given on Fig.1. It is easy to verify that the correspondence s \u2192 s\u2032\ninduces an isomorphism of the convex 4-geometries defined by L and L\u2032 . Indeed,\nthere are exactly 10 rooted triangles in L (correspondingly, in L\u2032 after replacement\nof each s by s\u2032 ) :\n({i, c1 , c2 }, y), ({i, b1 , b2 }, x), ({b1 , c1 , c2 }, y), ({c1 , b1 , b2 }, x), ({b2 , c1 , c2 }, y),\n({c2 , b1 , b2 }, x), ({j, c1 , c2 }, y), ({j, b1 , b2 }, x), ({y, b1 , b2 }, x), ({c1 , c2 , x}, y).\nOn the other hand, these two point configurations are not weakly equivalent.\nIndeed, consider the following property of an extreme point s in configuration L:\nAmong all the lines through s and the other extreme points, exactly three separate x and y.\nThere are only two points s among {b1 , b2 , c1 , c2 , i, j} with this property, namely,\ni and j.\nIn configuration L\u2032 , there are also only two points among {b\u20321 , b\u20322 , c\u20321 , c\u20322 , i\u2032 , j \u2032 }\nwith the property of separating x\u2032 and y \u2032 , namely c\u20322 and b\u20322 .\nCrucially, the property that a line, say line(c\u20322 , i\u2032 ), separates x\u2032 and y \u2032 , can be\nexpressed in terms of orientations: sign(c\u20322 , i\u2032 , x\u2032 ) 6= sign(c\u20322 , i\u2032 , y \u2032 ). Hence, if L and\nL\u2032 would be weakly equivalent as order types, i, j would need to be mapped to c\u20322\nand b\u20322 . Also, being inner points, x, y would need to be mapped to x\u2032 , y \u2032 . But such\na mapping cannot preserve, neither reverse, the order type since line(i, j) separates\nx, y and line(c\u20322 , b\u20322 ) does not separate x\u2032 , y \u2032 .\n4. Order types of a realizable convex 4-geometry\nThis leads us to define Order-Types(J, RT ) as the set of all order types tf :\nJ[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} induced by realizations f : J \u2192 R2 of the convex 4-geometry\n(J, RT ). In particular, Order-Types(J, RT ) = \u2205 if (J, RT ) is not realizable. Let\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n9\n\nOrder-Types(J, RT ) be the set of equivalence classes of order types contained in\nOrder-Types(J, RT ).\nLet us first dispense with the case of a free convex 4-geometry (J, \u2205). Observe\nthat q(J, RT ) = 1 \u21d4 RT = \u2205. If |J| = n then any n-gon (n points in general\nposition) is a realization of (J, \u2205). Furthermore, if X, Y \u2286 R2 are two n-gons, then\nthere are n bijections F : X \u2192 Y that preserve the orientations of triples, namely\nprecisely those F 's that map a fixed cyclic (say clockwise) ordering of X onto one of\nthe n cyclic clockwise enumerations of Y . In particular3, |Order-T ypes(J, \u2205)| = 1.\n\n4.1. Realizable convex 4-geometries with few order types. Consider the\ncase of a convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) with q(J) = 2 with just one interior point.\nDenote by L the outside layer of (J, RT ), and let p be the unique point of the inside\nlayer.\nUnderlying the results of Edelman and Larman [6], is the definition of equivalent\nelements of L: Put s \u2261 t, if\n(\u2200u, v \u2208 L) ({u, v, s}, p) \u2208 RT \u21d4 ({u, v, t}, p) \u2208 RT .\nIn particular, s, t cannot be equivalent, when s, t are in a common rooted triangle.\nIt turns out that if s1 , s2 , . . . , sk are equivalent elements in some realizable convex\n4-geometry (J, RT ), then in any realization of (J, RT ), all elements s1 , s2 , . . . , sk\nappear in one cluster in a circular order of layer L, i.e. no proper subset of\n{s1 , s2 , . . . , sk } can be flanked in that circular order by some elements non-equivalent\nto si .\nThis observation, even though not spelled out in [6], led to the notion of irreducible convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) as one with no equivalent elements in L. The\nidea was to reduce clusters of equivalent elements of the outside layer L to unique\npoints and consider this simplified convex 4-geometry about which one can make\nstrong statements. One of the crucial results of [6] is\nTheorem 4.1. (Theorem 3.5 in [6]) If (J, RT ) is a realizable irreducible convex\n4-geometry with the outside layer L and one inner point then the circular order of\nL in any point realization is determined uniquely up to reflection.\nCorollary 4.2. If (J, RT ) is a realizable convex 4-geometry with outside layer L\nand one inner point, then Order-Types(J, RT ) has cardinality at most two.\nProof. According to Theorem 4.1 above, there is maximum two non-equivalent\norder types of irreducible convex geometry (J \u2032 , RT ) deduced from (J, RT ). Since\nall equivalent elements of L are located in clusters, and since any order of equivalent\nelements within a cluster produces an equivalent order type, we can obtain at most\ntwo nonequivalent order types t1 , t2 . In fact, for self-symmetric point configurations,\nt1 and t2 may be equivalent order-types.\n\u0003\nWe can follow-up with the definition of equivalent elements of the outermost\nlayer L0 of a convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) in general. If p is a point inside that layer,\nthen we can define an equivalence \u2261p on L0 as follows: s \u2261p t, if ({s, u, v}, p) is\n3As an exercise, prove that |Order-Types(J, \u2205)| = (n \u2212 1)!. In the present article (i.e. Part I)\nwe stick to Order-Types. More about Order-Types and automorphisms of 4-geometries follows in\nPart II.\n\n\f10\n\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\n\na rooted triangle iff ({t, u, v}, p) is a rooted triangle, for any u, v \u2208 L0 . If P is\nthe collection of all points p inside layer L0 , then we can define s \u2261 t and call s, t\nequivalent iff s \u2261p t, for every p \u2208 P .\nIt turns out that, unlike the case of one inner point, the equivalent elements\nof a layer no longer should appear in clusters, even when we increase the number\nof inner points by just one. Return to Example 3.5 for an illustration. One can\ndirectly check that points i, j are equivalent points on the outside layer of the convex\n4-geometry, and they appear in one cluster in realization L\u2032 , while they are flanked\non both sides by non-equivalent points in point configuration L.\nDefinition 4.3. We will call (J, RT ) simple, if the outermost layer L0 of (J, RT )\ndoes not have equivalent elements.\nEvidently, the notion of a simple geometry corresponds to \"irreducible\" convex\ngeometry of [6] in case of one inner point.\nTheorem 4.4. In any realization f : J \u2192 R2 of a realizable simple convex 4geometry (J, RT ) with q(J, RT ) \u2265 2, the cyclic ordering of the outermost layer is\nuniquely determined up to reflection.\nProof. Let L0 be any outside layer of (J, RT ). Let P be the set of inner points\nfor this layer. For any p \u2208 P , consider a sub-geometry of (J, RT ) defined on\nJp = L \u222a {p}. According to Theorem 4.1, there exists unique up to reflection\ncircular order of clusters S1 , . . . , Skp of \u2261p -equivalent elements of layer L0 . We\nclaim that this \"partial\" circular order of L can be uniquely extended to a \"linear\"\ncircular order of L0 .\nIf there exists a cluster of more than one point, say, S1 has points s1 , s2 , then\nthere should be an inner point q such that (s1 , s2 ) 6\u2208\u2261q . Since (J, RT ) is realizable,\nthere should be a circular order of clusters of \u2261q -equivalent points compatible with\nS1 , . . . , Sk (we choose one of two existing that will follow the orientation of the\nfirst choice). The intersection of these two equivalences on L0 will provide a new\nequivalence, i.e. a linear order of clusters, in which s1 , s2 are no longer in one\ncluster.\n\u0003\n4.2. Realizable convex 4-geometries with many order types. Example 3.5\ngives an idea of series of examples of convex 4-geometries with the growing number\nof non-equivalent order types.

For any k \u2208 \u03c9, there exists a series Jk = {J(p) : p > k} of\nrealizable convex 4-geometries J(p) with two layers such that f (p) = |J(p)| = O(p),\nwhile g(p) = |Order-Types(J(p))| = O(pk ).\nProof. We first explain the idea for k = 1 and k = 2. When k = 1, we use point\nconfiguration L given on the left side of Figure 5. For any p > 1, let J(p) be a\nconvex 4-geometry with two layers, whose first layer consists of c1 , c2 , b1 , b2 and p\nadditional points, while the inner layer consists of two points x and y. This convex\ngeometry can be obtained from its point realization when i, j of point configuration\nL are replaced by p\u2032 and (p\u2212p\u2032 ) points, correspondingly, for some p\u2032 \u2264 p. One needs\nto make sure that these points are just slightly displaced from original positions of\ni and j so that all p points are in the same outside layer and they are equivalent.\nWhen p\u2032 = p one gets a configuration similar to L\u2032 on the right side of Figure 5,\nwhere all p points could be\u0004 located\non the segment between i and j. Changing\n\u0005\np\u2032 from p to 0 one obtains p+1\ndifferent\norder types corresponding to the same\n2\nconvex geometry. Thus, |Order-Types(J(p))| = O(p).\nFor k = 2, consider the points configuration on Figure 6. It replicates point\nconfiguration L, replacing two equivalent elements of outside layer i, j by three\nequivalent elements i, j, m placed at the vertices of equilateral triangle. We then\nplace b1 , b2 on the arc connecting i, j, c1 , c2 on the arc j, m and d1 , d2 on the arc\nm, i. The inner layer now consists of three elements x, y, z, placed close to the\ncenter of segments [b1 , b2 ], [c1 , c2 ], [d1 , d2 ], correspondingly. The number of rooted\ntriangle is 21: say, x is inside T (t, b1 , b2 ), where t ranges over all points of the\noutside layer other than b1 , b2 ; similarly, for y and z. For any p > 2 one could split\np points into three subsets of p\u2032\u2032 , p\u2032 and (p \u2212 p\u2032 \u2212 p\u2032\u2032 ) elements, for some p\u2032 + p\u2032\u2032 \u2264 p\nand place, slightly displaced, into positions of i, j and m correspondingly, so that\nall p points are equivalent. This produces the point realization for J(p) from series\n2\nof\nL3 . Evidently, |J(p)| = O(p). Varying p\u2032\u2032 and p\u2032 we may obtain about 13 Cp+1\n2\nnon-equivalent order-types, in particular, |Order-Types(J(p))| = O(p ).\n\n\f12\n\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\n\nFor arbitrary k one would start with the configuration that has i1 , . . . , ik+1 at\nthe vertices of the regular (k + 1)-gon, then placing a pair of points b1j , b2j on the\narc connecting ij and ij+1 . Finally, there is k points x1 , . . . , xk of the inner layer,\nplaced close enough to the center of each segment [b1j , b2j ]. One makes sure that xj\nis in triangle T (t, b1j , b2j ), where t ranges over all points of the outside layer, other\nthan b1j , b2j . In particular, all elements i1 , . . . , ik+1 are equivalent. As for examples\nabove, place p > k points into locations of i1 , . . . , ik+1 , splitting p into subsets with\np1 , . . . , pk , (p \u2212 (p1 + * * * + pk )) points, correspondingly, for some p1 + * * * + pk \u2264 p.\nThis produces a point realization for a convex geometry J(p) from series Lk , whose\nsize grows as O(p), while the number of non-equivalent order types is O(pk ).\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.6. The growth of |Order-Types(J(p))| of two-layered convex 4-geometries\nJ(p) of size O(p) cannot be p-polynomially bounded.\n5. Quasi order types\nSuppose t = tf is an order type on a set J, and x, y \u2208 J are such that either\n(3)\n\n(\u2200z \u2208 J \u2212 {x, y}) t(x, y, z) = 1 or (\u2200z \u2208 J \u2212 {x, y}) t(x, y, z) = \u22121.\n\nThen obviously f (x), f (y) must be two adjacent points of the outermost layer of\nthe point configuration f (J) \u2286 R2 . The converse holds as well. This motivates the\nfollowing concept. For any function t : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1}, call {x, y} \u2286 J a quasi-edge\nof t if (3) takes place. The set J being finite we may recursively define a quasi order\ntype as any function t : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} such that\n(i) the graph G, whose edge set E(G) is the set of all quasi-edges of t, is a\ncycle (called a quasi layer), and\n(ii) the set J \u2032 := J \u2212 \u222aE(G) is either empty, or the restriction of t to J \u2032 [3] is a\nquasi order type.\nIt is clear that each order type is a quasi order type in such a way that layers and\nquasi layers coincide. Furthermore, it takes time O(n3 ) (n = |J|) to check whether\nor not a function t : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} is a quasi order type.\nThe depth of a quasi order type is the number q(t) of its quasi layers.\nA quasi rooted triangle of a quasi order type t : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} is a pair\n({a, b, c}, d) satisfying\nt(a, b, c) = t(d, b, c) = t(a, d, c) = t(a, b, d)\nIt takes time O(n4 ) to compute the set QRT (t) of all quasi rooted triangles of\nt. Dito it costs O(n4 ) to decide whether QRT (t) satisfies the Dietrich axiom and\nhence yields a convex 4-geometry [Prop.2.1]. A quasi order type t satisfying the\nDietrich axiom is simple if QRT (t) yields a simple convex 4-geometry in the sense\nof Definition 4.3.\nRemark 5.1. Observe that it can be tested in polynomial time whether or not a\nfunction t : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} is a simple quasi order type.\n6. Complexity of the modified Edelman-Jamison problem\nWe tempt to link the Edelman-Jamison Problem 1.1 to\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n13\n\nProblem 6.1. The Order Type Problem Given any function t : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121},\nrecognize whether it is an order type and, if it is, find some realizing point configuration.\nIt is known that the Order Type Problem is NP-hard; that follows from the\nfamous Mn\u00ebv's Universality Theorem [8].\nIn this section we consider the modified Edelman-Jamison Problem and we will\nshow that it is polynomially equivalent to the Order-Type Problem.\nProblem 6.2. Suppose we are given a convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) and, in addition,\nsome fixed circular order of the outermost layer L0 = {a1 , . . . , an }. The modified\nEdelman-Jamison Problem asks whether this geometry can be realized by a point\nconfiguration in the Euclidean plane with this given clock-wise circular order\nof the outermost layer.\nWe will say that a function t\u2217 : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121} supports the clock-wise circular\norder L0 = {a1 , . . . , an }, if t\u2217 (ai , aj , ak ) = \u22121 for all i < j < k (modulo n).\nTheorem 6.3. Given a finite convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) and a circular order L0 =\n{a1 , . . . , an } of its outermost layer, one can decide in polynomial time that either\nthis geometry is not realizable with such circular order, or define a unique function\nt\u2217 : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121} associated with the geometry that supports the clock-wise circular\norder L0 . If (J, RT ) happens to be realizable, then every point realization of (J, RT )\nwith the given clock-wise order of L0 will be, as an order type, weakly equivalent to\nt\u2217 .\nIn other words, if the geometry is realizable then knowing the clock-wise circular\norder of its outermost layer defines uniquely the order type of its realization.\nIn order to prove Theorem 6.3, we need to introduce the following definitions.\nDefinition 6.4. A circular ordering {a1 , . . . , an } of the outermost layer L0 of a\nconvex 4-geometry (J, RT ) satisfies the carousel rule if, for any element x \u2208 J, and\nany element y \u2208 J\\L0 , there exists exactly one i \u2264 n such that\n({x, ai , ai+1 }, y) \u2208 RT\n\n(modulo n)\n\n(CR)\n\nFigure 7 illustrates the carousel rule in the realizable case. Point y belongs to the\npolytope with vertices a1 , . . . , an , in that circular order, but it is not a vertex of this\npolytope. For any other point x of that polytope (including the case when x is one\nof a1 , . . . , an ) we consider the splitting of the polytope into triangles {x, ai , ai+1 }.\nThe carousel rule is the statement that y belongs to only one of those triangles.\n\n\f14\n\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\n\na n\u22121\nan\nx\na1\n\nai\n\ny\n\na2\nFigure 7.\nDefinition 6.5. We will say that the convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) satisfies the 3carousel rule, if for any five distinct points a, b, c, x, y \u2208 J with x, y \u2208 {a, b, c}\nexactly one of the following alternatives takes place:\nx \u2208 {a, b, y},\n\nx \u2208 {a, c, y} x \u2208 {b, c, y}\n\nOf course, the first statement, say, amounts to ({a, b, y}, x) \u2208 RT , but this notation\nwould be a bit clumsy.\nLemma 6.6. Every realizable 4-geometry (J, RT ) satisfies 3-carousel rule. Besides,\nif {a1 , . . . , an } is a circular ordering of the outermost layer in some point realization,\nthen this ordering satisfies the carousel rule.\nThe proof is evident.\nLemma 6.7. Given a finite convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) and a circular order L0 =\n{a1 , . . . , an } of its outermost layer, it can be checked in polynomial time whether this\nordering satisfies the carousel rule, and this convex 4-geometry satisfies 3-carousel\nrule.\nLemma 6.8. In a convex 4-geometry that satisfies 3-carousel rule the following\nholds: if b, x \u2208 T (a, aj , aj+1 ) and x \u2208 T (b, aj , aj+1 ) then one and only one statements holds: b \u2208 T (x, a, aj ) or b \u2208 T (x, a, aj+1 ).\nProof. By the 3-carousel roule the only other possiblity for b a priori is b \u2208 {aj , aj+1 , x}.\nHowever, because of x \u2208 {aj , aj+1 , b} and the anti-exchange property, this can't\nhappen.\n\u0003\nProof. of Theorem 6.3. Suppose we are given a finite convex 4-geometry (J, RT )\nand a circular order L0 = {a1 , . . . , an } of its outermost layer. Due to Lemma 6.7,\nin polynomial time one can check whether the carousel rule is satisfied for the given\nordering of L0 , and whether the 3-carousel rule holds. If either fails, then, according\nto Lemma 6.6, the geometry is not realizable with the given ordering of L0 .\nIf they both hold then we are going to define the unique function t\u2217 : J[3] \u2192\n{1, \u22121} associated with the given geometry and supporting \"clock-wise\" ordering\nof L0 .\nIn order to define t\u2217 : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121} we will show that every ordered pair\n(a, b) \u2208 J 2 triggers a unique splitting of J1 = J\\{a, b} into two subsets K and K \u2032 .\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n15\n\nWe will be guided by the requirement that, in case the geometry happens to be\nrealizable by some point configuration where the points a1 , . . . , an of the outermost\nlayer follow clock-wise, the proposed splitting will represent the splitting of J1 into\nthese two subsets: those points that lie in the \"left\" semi-plane with respect to (the\nsuitably directed) line(a, b), and those that lie in the \"right\" semi-pane. Thus, we\nwould define t\u2217 (a, b, x) = 1 for every x \u2208 K and t\u2217 (a, b, x) = \u22121 for every x \u2208 K \u2032 .\nIn fact, referring to the definition of the order type [7], the knowledge of how a\nset of points in R is split into two subsets K and K \u2032 (\"left\" and \"right\") by any line\nthrough two points, defines the order type of the given configuration up to weak\nequivalence.\nIf a, b are points in L0 , then assuming, say, a = ai , b = aj with i < j, we define\nK = J1 \u2229 {ai , ai+1 , . . . , aj } and K \u2032 = J1 \u2229 {aj , aj+1 , . . . , ai } (modulo n). It follows\nfrom the carousel rule for this ordering of L0 that every point in J1 will be exactly\nin one of K or K \u2032 .\nIf a \u2208 L0 and b 6\u2208 L0 , then a is, say, a1 , and, according to the carousel rule,\nb \u2208 T := {a, aj , aj+1 }, for uniquely defined j > 1. Again, due to carousel rule,\nevery point of J1 will be exactly in one of three sets: A1 = {a1 , . . . , aj }, T , or\nA2 = {aj , . . . , an , a1 }. Besides, every point of J1 that gets into T , will be exactly\nin one of three sets:\nT1 := {a, aj , b},\n\nT2 := {a, aj+1 , b},\n\nT3 := {b, aj , aj+1 }\n\nThus, every point of J1 will be in one and only one of these sets:\nB1 := A1 \u222a T1 ,\n\nB2 := A2 \u222a T2 ,\n\nT3\n\nBy Lemma 6.8, for each x \u2208 T3 exactly one of these statements is true: b \u2208 {x, a, aj }\nor b \u2208 {x, a, aj+1 }. Hence it is clear that we need to define\nK\n\n:=\n\n(B1 \u222a {x \u2208 T3 | b \u2208 {x, a, aj+1 }}) \\ {a, b}\n\nK\u2032\n\n:=\n\n(B2 \u222a {x \u2208 T3 | b \u2208 {x, a, aj }} ) \\ {a, b}\n\nThe last case, when both a, b are not in L0 , is similar to the previous. One finds,\ndue to the carousel rule, the unique i < j such that, say, a \u2208 {b, ai , ai+1 }, and\nb \u2208 {a, aj , aj+1 }. Then every point of J1 \\ L0 will be in one and only one of the\nfollowing four sets (Fig.8 visualizes the realizable case):\nT := {a, ai , ai+1 }, A1 := {a, ai+1 , * * * , aj }, T \u2032 := {a, aj , aj+1 }, A2 := {a, aj+1 , * * * , ai }\n\n\f16\n\nKIRA ADARICHEVA AND MARCEL WILD\n\naj+1\n\nA2\nai\n\nb\naj\n\na\n\nA1\na i+1\nFigure 8.\nDue to the 3-carousel rule every point of T \u2032 \\ {a, aj , aj+1 , b} is in one and only\none of the sets\nT1\u2032 := {b, a, aj }, T2\u2032 := {b, aj , aj+1 }, T3\u2032 := {b, aj+1 , a}\nTherefore, if we put\nK\n\n:= (A1 \u222a T1\u2032 \u222a {x \u2208 T2\u2032 | b \u2208 {x, a, aj+1 }} \u222a {x \u2208 T | a \u2208 {x, b, ai }}) \\ {a, b}\n\nK\u2032\n\n:= (A2 \u222a T3\u2032 \u222a {x \u2208 T2\u2032 | b \u2208 {x, a, aj }} \u222a {x \u2208 T | a \u2208 {x, b, ai+1 }) \\ {a, b}\n\nthen K, K \u2032 is a bipartition of J1 which, should (J, RT ) be realizable, is induced by\nthe line through a and b.\nAssume now that given convex 4-geometry (J, RT ) is realizable with the clockwise order L0 of its outermost layer. Then the procedure described above corresponds to splitting points realizing J into two subsets, for any points a, b \u2208 J: to\nthose that belong to the \"left\" semi-plane with respect to directed line(a, b), and\nto those that belong to \"right\" semi-plane. Thus, produced function t\u2217 : J[3] \u2192\n{1, \u22121} represents an order-type of the configuration. Besides, it supports the\nclock-wise order of L0 . It proves that all possible point configurations of (J, RT )\nwith the given clock-wise order of L0 will be equivalent as order-types.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.9. The modified Edelman-Jamison Problem is equivalent to the OrderType Problem. In particular, the modified Edelman-Jamison Problem is NP-hard.\nProof. Indeed, given an instance of modified Edelman-Jamison Problem, in polynomial time one can check whether (J, RT ) it satisfies carousel rule for the given\norder of the outermost layer, and whether (J, RT ) satisfies 3-carousel rule. If\nnot, (J, RT ) is not realizable. Otherwise, we obtain a uniquely defined function\nt\u2217 : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121} that supports the given clock-wise order of the outermost layer,\nthus, obtaining the instance of the Order Type Problem. If the latter is solved positively, the same point configuration will provide the solution to modified EdelmanJamison Problem. If it is solved negatively, the modified Edelman-Jamison Problem\nis refuted, too.\n\n\fREALIZATION OF ABSTRACT CONVEX GEMETRIES\n\n17\n\nVice versa, given an instance of the Order Type Problem, in polynomial time,\none can either refute, or assert that the given function t : J[3] \u2192 {1, \u22121} is a quasi\norder type. In particular, the convex 4-geometry will be defined together with the\nclock-wise ordering of the outermost layer, thus, we will get the instance of the\nmodified Edelman-Jamison Problem. According to Theorem 6.3, if this convex\ngeometry with the given clock-wise ordering is realized, then such a realization will\nrepresent a unique order-type t\u2217 that supports the given clock-wise order of the\noutermost layer. Note that t and t\u2217 will agree on any triple of elements from L0 .\nIt will take polynomial time to check whether t and t\u2217 agree on all triples, and if\nthey do, the Order Type Problem is solved positively, otherwise - not.\nIf the geometry cannot be realized with the given ordering of the outermost layer,\nthen the quasi order type is not an order type.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.10. The following problems are equivalent:\n(a) There is a polynomial time algorithm which decides whether a simple quasi\norder type t : J[3] \u2192 {\u22121, 1} is an order type.\n(b) There is a polynomial time algorithm that decides whether a given simple\nconvex geometry is realizable.\nProof. This follows from Corollary 6.9 due to Theorem 4.4. Indeed, simple convex 4geometry has a unique circular ordering of the outermost layer. Thus, the modified\nEdelman-Jamison Problem for such geometry is equivalent to Edelman-Jamison\nProblem.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgments.
