When used in combination with\nthe NAOMI Adaptive Optics system and the OASIS visible-wavelength Integral\nField Spectrograph, I demonstrate that there are substantial, exciting areas of astrophysical research in which the WHT can contribute.\nKey words: instrumentation: adaptive optics, instrumentation: spectrographs\nPACS: 95.55.-n\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany people have been involved in generating the science case for the addition\nof a Rayleigh Laser Guide Star (LGS) (Rutten et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2003;\nRutten, 2004) to the OASIS IFU spectrograph (Benn et al., 2003; McDermid et al.,\n2004c,b) combined with the NAOMI Adaptive Optics (AO) system (Myers et al.,\n2003; Jolley et al., 2004; Benn et al., 2004) on the William Herschel Telescope\non La Palma. The co-authors listed on some versions of the LGS proposal are:\nRene Rutten, Roland Bacon, Richard Bingham, Paul Clark, Roger Davies,\nRon Humphreys, Tom Gregory, Johan Knapen, Gil Moretto, Tim Morris, Simon Morris, Richard Myers, Gordon Talbot, Richard Wilson, Tim de Zeeuw.\nAs a member of this group, I (SLM) was invited to summarize this science case.\nI have chosen to only cover part of the science case, and also (as is traditional\nEmail address: simon.morris@durham.ac.uk (Simon L. Morris).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n27 March 2018\n\n\ffor conference reviewers the world over) to focus on science areas currently\nbeing pursued by myself or colleagues at Durham University. As a result, this\nis by no means an exhaustive list, but it is one that I am better qualified to\nwrite on, and it does contain some updates from the original proposal.\nThe topics discussed below will all be ones that can be attacked with the\ninstrument combination in the title (i.e. in the optical, with relatively low\nStrehl), and using the WHT collecting area, although obviously many of them\nare also topics that larger aperture telescopes are also addressing. I have also\ntried to focus on cases where observations with the WHT are not only useful,\nbut also where the OASIS+NAOMI+LGS combination there has some sort of\nan advantage or at least only a small number of competitors.\n\n2\n\nScience Changes produced by Installation of a Laser Guide Star\n\nThis subject was covered by several people attending the workshop, but in\norder to make this summary relatively self-contained, I will repeat some of it\nhere.\nFar and away the most significant change in the science potential for OASIS+NAOMI from the addition of the LGS is the gain in sky coverage. Some\ngraphical demonstrations of the magnitude of this change were developed by\nRemko Stuik (Leiden), and shown in several of the presentations. Apart from\ndeep in the galactic plane, the chance of finding a bright enough guide star\nfor NAOMI without a LGS is never higher that 10%. In contrast, with an\nLGS, the probability of finding a suitable natural tip-tilt star (which is still\nneeded) is above 80% for 2/3 of the sky, and above 60% for near 9/10 of the\nsky. As will be detailed below, this makes a qualitative difference to the types\nof science that can be done. Targets which are suited to 4m class high spatial\nresolution IFU spectroscopy are rare, and multiplying that rarity by the small\nsky coverage of an NGS AO system reduces the number of interesting science\ntargets to near zero.\nSome secondary effects are of mixed value. The LGS point spread function\n(PSF) can either be better or worse than the NGS PSF depending on the\nNGS brightness and location. For many science targets this means there will\nbe an improvement in the delivered image quality, even if a usable NGS is\nin the field. For a few objects this will not not be the case. In all cases the\nPSF will be very far from the diffraction limit due to operation in the optical\nwith a (relatively) modest number of correcting elements. As was emphasized\nduring the meeting, and in some of the examples below, this sort of 'improved\nseeing' can be extremely valuable. The predictable brightness and location\nof the LGS relative to the science target will make the science target PSF\n2\n\n\fmore predictable and reduce the challenges of estimating the delivered image\nquality. Finally, the operational impact of keeping an LGS up and running\nmay or may not impact on the efficiency of observing. Overheads could be\nincreased by the need to lock on to the laser, but, conversely, its predictable\nand repeatable location and brightness could produce efficiency savings.\n\n3\n\nAn Example of Galactic Science Enabled by a LGS\n\nIn the proposal, galactic science targets ranging from sub-stellar companions,\nthrough mass loss in stars, to exotic binary systems in crowded fields were considered. Here I will focus on one particularly intriguing science case - namely\nthe search for intermediate mass black holes.\n\n3.1 Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Globular Clusters\n\nAlthough the evidence for stellar mass black holes (M\u2264 10M\u2299 ) and for supermassive black holes (M\u2265 106 M\u2299 ) is now viewed by most astronomers as\niron-clad, there is a 'missing link' mass range in between for which there is little observational support. One very promising hunting ground for black holes\nin this mass range is the core of a globular cluster. This is for two reasons.\nFirst, that many formation scenarios for such black hole masses place them\nat the bottom of potential wells in crowded stellar environments, and second, that the crowded stellar environment provides one with a surplus of test\nmasses which can map out the potential well and be used to test for point\ngravitational sources.\nTragically, this same surplus of test particles makes crowding a real problem,\nand deblending the light from individual stars in order to have a clean velocity\nmeasurement requires high spatial resolution and a good knowledge of the\nPSF.\nValiant attempts to conclusively demonstrate the presence of an intermediate\nblack hole were made by van der Marel et al. (2002); Gerssen et al. (2002,\n2003) and Gerssen (2004). As an example, using the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) STIS spectrograph, radial velocities for 64 stars in the core of the\nglobular cluster M15 were measured and combined with velocities measured\nfrom the ground for 1800 other stars. Unfortunately, although it was possible\nto show that a model with a 1700 M\u2299 black hole gave a better fit to the\ndata than one without one, the 'no black hole' model was still statistically\nconsistent with the data.\n3\n\n\fAn AO fed IFU able to observe the cores of several nearby globular clusters\nmay well be able to improve the statistics to the point at which the black\nhole solution is shown to be inescapable. However, detailed modelling is still\nneeded to show that (a) the OASIS spectral resolution is sufficient, and (b)\nthat the PSF improvements from NAOMI+LGS in the optical are sufficient\nfor this approach to generate new science.\n\n4\n\nExamples of Nearby-Galaxy Science Enabled by a LGS\n\nThe workshop poster carried a dramatic image illustrating the additional science to be gained by increasing the spatial resolution of velocity measurements\nin the cores of nearby galaxies (http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/ING/conferences/aoworkshop/aoworkshop.p\nThis image was literally the 'poster-child' for the workshop and was very persuasive. I do not propose to go into this science case in any detail, but do\ninclude a few references here for completeness.\n\n4.1 Detailed Dynamics of Nearby Spheroid Dominated Galaxies\n\nThe SAURON IFU spectrograph had an extremely well defined and focussed\nscience goal. As I will outline later, this has not stopped it from being used\nfor a number of other science projects, but it has certainly amply achieved its\nbuilders' goals as described in Bacon et al. (2001); de Zeeuw et al. (2002) and\nEmsellem et al. (2004). The core goal of understanding the formation process\nfor elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies has been advanced by\nthe quantification of the percentages of counter-rotating cores, rotationally\nsupported disks and the measurement of spatially resolved stellar ages and\nabundances in these systems.\nAs illustrated in the conference poster and also in McDermid et al. (2004a)\nand Copin et al. (2004), higher spatial resolution observations of galactic cores\noften brings to light substructure that was invisible at coarser resolution. As\nwith most of the cases in this review, the greatly increased sky coverage of a\nLGS system is needed to enable observations of a reasonable sample.\n\n4.2 Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei\nI do not propose to comment at any length on the use of OASIS+NAOMI\nwith a LGS to study Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) either, as this was also\ncovered by several other speakers at the workshop. However, I could not resist a\n4\n\n\fnostalgic revisit to a paper from twenty years ago (Morris et al. (1985)) which\nI claim already showed both the power of 3D spectroscopy for unravelling the\ncomplex dynamics of gas in the inner regions of AGN, and also the difficulty\nin using those measured dynamics to make general conclusions.\nI would also claim that Ferruit et al. (2004), who present some recent OASIS\ndata, faced the same problem. Indeed, a pessimist might conclude that a large\nfraction of the observed gas dynamics in AGN cores is chaotic, and, like the\nweather on the Earth, driven by the (AGN equivalent of) flaps of butterfly\nwings in China.\nIn order not to leave this topic on a wholly negative note, it is true that a\nsimilar conclusion might have been drawn about the stellar dynamics discussed\nin section 4.1. As shown by the papers referred to there, large enough samples\nof high quality 3D data may allow more general and useful conclusions to be\ndrawn.\nSome of the first AO assisted IFU observations were of 'the usual suspects'\nAGN - NGC 4151 and NGC 1068. These targets can be used as their own\nguide stars and are hence well studied. I believe that until a sample of size\ncomparable to the SAURON galaxy survey has been observed, at a similar level\nof detail, 'general and useful conclusions' will remain elusive. There is also a\nwell known link between AGN activity and star formation (and corresponding\nstar formation driven winds). These two phenomena are so closely inter-related\nthat it would seem foolish to me to study one without studying the other. It has\nalways been one of the great strengths (and weaknesses) of 3D spectroscopy\nthat, with a single observation, one generally gets more information than can\neasily be dealt with on all of the phenomena in the region observed. For this\nreason, this approach may be the only one able to discover some underlying\nphysical principles hidden amongst the complex phenomenology of the inner\nregions of AGN.\n\n5\n\nExamples of Distant-Galaxy Science Enabled by a LGS\n\nAt first sight, one might suspect that using a 4m class telescope with fine\nspatial sampling to observe extremely distant (and hence faint) objects spectroscopically would be doomed to failure. In general, this suspicion is in fact\ntrue, and most of the results presented below are from 8m class telescopes.\nTwo factors act to open up a significant expanse of 'discovery space' for OASIS+NAOMI with a LGS. The first is that, in emission lines many extragalactic objects have regions of high surface brightness, and second, that many\nof these regions are in fact small, or knotty, so that any improvement in image\nquality over natural seeing can, to a certain extent, compensate for a smaller\n5\n\n\ftelescope collecting area.\n5.1 Extreme Star Formation\nObservations in the sub-mm region of the spectrum have shown that there\nis a significant population of dusty galaxies forming stars at extra-ordinary\nrates (\u2248 1000 M\u2299 yr \u22121). Key questions for these objects are: Are these massive galaxies with extreme star-formation rates, or simply an extremely active\nphase in more mundane systems? What drives the immense luminosity? What\nare the dynamical masses? What are the metallicities of the various components?\nSwinbank et al. (2005) demonstrate that a combination of optical and Near-IR\n(NIR) IFU observations can begin to unravel the answers to these questions.\nHST imaging has already also demonstrated that the spatial scales of interest\nare significantly less than an arcsecond.\nMore locally, Swinbank et al. (2005) show that optical IFU observations of\ngalaxies with spectroscopic evidence for a recent cessation of rapid star formation may help us to determine the cause of this truncation. Although probably a heterogeneous group, galaxies with strong Balmer absorption features in\ntheir spectra (from A stars), but weak emission lines indicating an absence of\nO and B stars, likely include objects caught in transition between star forming\n'spirals' and passive 'ellipticals'. High spatial resolution absorption line spectroscopy will no doubt be extremely time consuming on a 4m class telescope,\nbut is definitely not impossible, and the spatial resolution of an LGS system\nshould deliver many of the benefits outlined in section 4.1 for the SAURON\nproject.\n5.2 Gravitational Lensed High Redshift Galaxies\nOne of the images used in the original science case for a LGS for the WHT\nwas that of the gravitationally multiply-lensed galaxy behind the cluster Cl\n0024+1654 (http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1996/10/).\nThe gravitational lens increases the total flux collected from a distant galaxy\nand spreads the unlensed image out over one or more magnified images. Unfortunately, such fortuitous alignments of galaxies with locations of strong\nlensing are rare, and, again, asking for the additional requirement of a bright\nnatural guide star reduces the sample which can be studied with high spatial\nresolution to near zero. The cluster Cl 0024+1654 is a case in point, with the\nnearest available star 65 arcsec away and 16.5 magnitude in R (making it a\nsuitable tip-tilt reference for LGS AO, but of no use for NGS AO).\n6\n\n\fSwinbank et al. (2003) demonstrated the power of this approach on a z\u22481\ngalaxy, where they show that by using an IFU, and correcting for the distortions in the image by the lensing process, one can derive accurate rotation\ncurves, and hence mass-estimates at high redshifts. These measurements also\nallow the construction of Tully-Fisher diagrams at times when the Universe\nwas half its present age. These in turn can be used to test models for galaxy\nformation.\n\n5.3 Lyman \u03b1 Emitters\nObjects with redshifts between 3 and 7 have rest frame Lyman \u03b1 at observed\nwavelengths convenient for ground based AO assisted IFU observations.\nThe SAURON IFU spectrograph on the WHT has been used on some lower\nredshift (z\u22483) strong Lyman \u03b1 emitters, deriving some exciting conclusions\nabout feedback from star formation at high redshift (Bower et al., 2004; Wilman et al.,\n2005). Although extremely long exposure times may be needed, LGS AO assisted IFU observations of these, and other similar objects, could greatly improve our understanding of the gas dynamics and the radiative transfer of\nLyman \u03b1 photons in galaxies. As an example, in the Lyman Break Galaxy\n(LBG) C15 discussed in Bower et al. (2004), a clear velocity shear can be seen\nacross the line emitting region (even with seeing limited spatial resolution).\nAt the moment, the interpretation of that shear remains ambiguous. Are we\nseeing an outflow tilted to our line of sight, or are we seeing coherent rotation,\nholding out the promise of a total mass estimate for this object?\nIn several knots of the large Lyman \u03b1 emitter studied by Wilman et al. (2005),\nthere is strong absorption which they interpret as evidence for an outflowing\nwind covering the whole source. Higher spectral and spatial resolution observations, although no doubt extremely expensive in observing time, might be\nable to confirm this interpretation.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nI hope this review has demonstrated that despite its now 'small' collecting area,\nand the traditionally photon starved nature of IFU observations, there is still a\nsubstantial range of interesting astrophysical questions that can be addressed\nusing the LGS with NAOMI and OASIS on the WHT. The combined gains\nfrom focussing on high surface brightness emission line objects and increasing\nthat surface brightness by image sharpening with AO will keep the WHT\nscientifically competitive on targets with no natural guide star.\n7\n\n\fFig. 1. Single Gaussian fits to SAURON observations of the Steidel 'blob 1'. The\nregion plotted is 41\u00d733 arcseconds in angular size. Panel (a) shows the intensity of\nthe fitted line (red\u2013white: 0\u20132 \u00d7 10\u221217 ergs per cm2 per sq. arcsec); Panel (b), the\ncentral wavelength of the line (blue\u2013red: 4970\u20134990\u00c5); Panel (c), the width of the\nline (red\u2013white: \u03c3 = 0\u201315\u00c5). The plots allow us to quantify the velocity structure\nseen in the halo. The circles show the regions of interest (see Bower et al., 2004),\nwith the top left circle identifying the LBG C15 referred to in section 5.3.\n\nI would like to end with a comment on serendipity. This might seem unlikely\nto be relevant for a small field of view, high spatial resolution instrument\nlike OASIS, but I would claim that, to a first approximation, the chances of\nserendipitous discoveries are related to the number of independent spatial and\nspectral samples, and the uniqueness of the planned targets of the instrument.\nSome historical examples that demonstrate this, despite having relatively small\nsky coverage were published by McCarthy et al. (1988); Dey et al. (1998). A\nrecent IFU example of serendipity (admittedly from a 'wide field' IFU) was\npublished by Jarvis et al. (2005). OASIS can sample a substantial volume of\nspace, if one views its wavelength axis as a redshift range, and will be one\nof the very few instruments able to deliver AO image quality over most of\nthe sky. In amongst all the careful discussions of signal-to-noise and detection\nlimits, it is good to also remember how exciting astronomical discovery is, and\nhow often astronomers have been surprised by what they have found.\n\nReferences\nBacon, R., and 12 colleagues 2001.
