Each model\nis composed of sequentially acting rolls whose axes lie in a plane and are rotated by\n120\u25e6 . In the limit when the switching from roll to roll is rapid, the tracer trajectories\nlimit onto a classical hexagonal convection pattern. As the switching time increases,\ntracer trajectories predominately lie on two-dimensional tori. Eventually, these tori\nare destroyed and the dynamics becomes chaotic and strongly mixing.\nThe mixing of tracer elements in a flow is due to a combination of stirring and diffusion. While\nstirring rapidly transports the tracers by kinematic advection, the associated stretching and folding\n\u2217\nPM was supported by NSF VIGRE grant DMS-9810751. KJ was supported in part by NSF grant OCE-0137347.\nJDM was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0707659.\n\n1\n\n\fof material lines and surfaces ultimately triggers diffusive processes that homogenize the tracers\ninto a blended mixture. Despite this relatively simple description, a complete understanding of\nthe spatial and temporal evolution of tracer elements in a given flow remains a mathematically\nchallenging problem [1]. This is further compounded if the tracers are not passively advected,\nbut nonlinearly interact with fluid flow and perhaps other species. The phenomena of mixing is\nfundamentally important in many physical and engineering applications and it occurs at a variety\nof scales ranging from the very small (micrometer scale) to the very large (planetary scales and\nbeyond). For instance, mixing in microchannels can be used to efficiently homogenize reagents in\nchemical reactions even when the flow is laminar [2]. In reaction-diffusion and combustion systems,\nthe efficiency of mixing reactive agents is a crucial factor. Understanding transport for planetary\nscale flows is critical for climate modeling and pollution dispersion in atmospheric science [3] and\neddy dynamics in oceanography [4].\nWhile mixing is prominent in turbulent flows, effective mixing also occurs in laminar flows that\nhave chaotic Lagrangian trajectories. The innovative work of Aref [5] gave birth to the subject of\nchaotic advection, which provides a mathematical foundation for investigating mixing and transport\nfrom a dynamical systems perspective [6]. Aref called his seminal model the \"blinking vortex;\" it was\nspecifically designed to yield nonintegrable Lagrangian trajectories. This model can be interpreted\nas an idealized mixing protocol where passive tracers are successively captured by the velocity fields\nof vortical stirrers that are the analogues of turbulent eddies with finite lifetimes.\nRecently, several models for three-dimensional Lagrangian dynamics have been constructed\nout of vortical roll arrays. Transport in a set of orthogonal, time independent roll arrays was\ninvestigated in [7, 8]. In this system long-range, superdiffusive transport only occurs along the\ndirection perpendicular to the axes of both rolls. This flow could be realized using a combination\nof thermal convection and magnetohydrodynamic forcing.\nIn a previous paper, we studied motion in a set of rolls whose axes are orthogonal, and whose\namplitudes oscillate [9]. This models the oscillations observed in experiments on convection in\nbinary fluids [10]. The experiments showed that the convective instability gives rise to a sequence of\ntemporally alternating, orthogonal roll arrays whose axes are parallel to the square boundaries. The\ntransition from one set of rolls to the other was observed to be rapid, so that much of the time the\nfluid is dominated by a single set of parallel rolls. In our model, regardless of the choice of temporal\ndependence of the roll amplitudes, the Lagrangian dynamics is restricted two-dimensional surfaces;\nconsequently, our model does not lead to three-dimensional mixing, though the two-dimensional\ndynamics can be chaotic. Our model contrasts with that of [7, 8] in that their rolls are 90\u25e6 out of\nphase.\nRoll-switching was predicted for rotating convection in thin fluids by K\u00fcppers and Lortz [11, 12].\nHere a thin fluid layer of large horizontal extent (i.e. small aspect ratio) is rotated about its vertical\naxis. When the rotation rate is small, a stationary roll pattern forms at a critical Rayleigh number.\nAbove a critical rotation rate this pattern becomes unstable to a second set of two-dimensional\nrolls whose axes are rotated with respect to the original roll axes by some \"switching angle,\" \u0398.\nThese rolls grow, causing the first set to decay. The secondary rolls then lose stability to a new set\nof rotated rolls and the process repeats.\nThis behavior has been observed in a variety of experiments [13]. Typically the weakly supercritical regime shows large patches of homogeneous rolls that loose stability to rolls with an\naxis rotated by a switching angle that varies with the Taylor and Prandtl numbers. For example\n2\n\n\fin water (Prandtl number near seven), \u0398 = 63 \u00b1 3\u25e6 [14]. Theoretical investigations confirm the\ndependence of \u0398 on rotation rate, boundary conditions, and Prandtl number [15, 16]. Though\nthe time dependence of the roll switching is not observed to be precisely periodic, there is a mean\nswitching frequency that decreases as the Taylor number increases, but increases with the Rayleigh\nnumber [17].\nMotivated by these experiments, we call three-dimensional fluid flow consisting of a set of rolls\nwith different axes, whose amplitudes oscillate a K\u00fcppers-Lortz state. In this paper we analyze a\nsimple model of the Lagrangian trajectories in a K\u00fcppers-Lortz state. We begin in \u00a72 by constructing a time-dependent model with a simple spatial roll structure. When the switching is much faster\nthan the roll turnover time, it can be idealized as instantaneous and the flow can be viewed as a\ncomposition of volume-preserving maps corresponding to the action of each individual roll. This\ngives rise to what we call a blinking roll model in \u00a73; it is analogous to Aref's blinking vortex model.\nTo check the importance of the assumption of instantaneous switching, we also introduce in \u00a74 a\ncontinuous model using the Busse-Heikes system of odes for the evolution of the roll amplitudes\n[18, 19]. When the switching angle \u0398 is 120\u25e6 or 60\u25e6 symmetry, as reviewed in \u00a75, allows us to\nrestrict our analysis to a fundamental hexagonal cell. Finally, in \u00a76, computational results are\ndiscussed and mixing is analyzed using Lyapunov exponents and anomalous diffusion exponents\n[20].\nEven when some three-dimensional mixing occurs in these models, it is usually not complete\nbecause there are families of two-dimensional invariant tori that form barriers to the Lagrangian\ntrajectories. Such families of tori are prominent in three-dimensional, incompressible flows; they\nplay a roll analogous to that of invariant closed curves in two-dimensional, area-preserving mappings\n[21]. Tori have also been experimentally observed, for example, in a cylindrical container with a\ntilted stirrer [22, 23]. These are visualized with sheet lasers and fluorescent dyes and correlate\nclosely with corresponding island chains of the Poincar\u00e9 sections of a model flow. Similar tori\nhave also been seen for weakly buoyant tracers in a laminar flow [24]. We investigate some of the\nbehavior of the families of tori in our system in \u00a76.\n\n2\n\nK\u00fcppers-Lortz Roll Model\n\nFor the purpose of making progress analytically, we use the simplest roll model for rotating convection: the linearized solutions in the Boussinesq approximation with stress-free boundary conditions\n[25]. These rolls are tilted by an angle \u03b7 due to the Coriolis force. In scaled coordinates with the\nfluid confined to z \u2208 [\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2], the roll velocity field is\nu\u03b7 = A (\u2212 tan(\u03b7) sin(y) sin(z), \u2212 sin(y) sin(z), \u2212 cos(y) cos(z)) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, A is the amplitude of the rolls and\ntan(\u03b7) =\n\nkc2\n\n\u03c4\n,\n+ \u03c02\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 denotes the Taylor number and kc is the critical wave number at the onset of convection.\nFor highly viscous flows and infinite Prandtl number, roll switching starts at a Taylor number\n\u03c4c = 54.8 with kc = 3.95, so that \u03b7 \u2248 65\u25e6 1 . When the thin fluid layer is not rotating, \u03c4 = \u03b7 = 0,\n1\n\nIn this case, the switching angle for the K\u00fcppers-Lortz state is \u0398 = 59.7\u25e6 [11].\n\n3\n\n\fand the velocity field simplifies to:\nu0 = A (0, \u2212 sin(y) sin(z), \u2212 cos(y) cos(z))\n\n(3)\n\nAlthough a rigid lower boundary together with a free upper surface is more physical (in which\ncase Chandrasekhar functions would be the appropriate building block [25]), this choice would\ncomplicate both the analytical and numerical treatment. Moreover, in the limit \u03c4 \u001d 1, it has been\n1\nshown [26, 27] that the stress-free solutions converge to the rigid ones outside the passive O(\u03c4 \u2212 2 )\nEkman boundary layers.\nTrajectories of (1) are confined to two-dimensional contours about axes parallel to \u00ea1 (the xaxis). A K\u00fcppers-Lortz state can be modeled in a simple way by using the roll solutions (1) as the\nbuilding blocks of the flow. Our model is a superposition of rolls with amplitudes Aj (t) whose axes\nare rotated by angles that are multiples of \u0398:\nu(x, t) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u0001\nAj+1 (t)R (j\u0398) u\u03b7 RT (j\u0398)x .\n\n(4)\n\nj=0\n\nHere R is the rotation about the z-axis by an angle \u0398:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ncos(\u0398) \u2212 sin(\u0398) 0\nR(\u0398) = \uf8ed sin(\u0398) cos(\u0398) 0\uf8f8 .\n0\n0\n1\n\n(5)\n\nSince each individual roll is incompressible, any composition with arbitrary time-dependence is also\nincompressible.\nWe will assume that the rolls act sequentially. That is, when the j th roll is active, the amplitudes\nof all other rolls are nearly zero, and that as t increases, Aj (t) decreases to zero, and the next roll\nAj+1 (t) activates and so forth.\n\u0398\nIf 2\u03c0\n= pq is rational, then it is appropriate to set N = q, since if the j th roll looses stability to\n\u0398\nthe (j + 1)st roll, then the whole process starts over after q steps. If, however, 2\u03c0\nwere irrational,\nthen the instability would continue to generate rolls at angles j\u0398, and the the \"number\" of rolls,\nN would be effectively infinite.\nThe simplest case of (4) corresponds to N = 2 and to orthogonal rolls, as we studied in [9].\nHere we will study the case N = 3 and a switching angle \u0398 = 2\u03c0/3. Letting\nR \u2261 R(2\u03c0/3)\nwe then have the velocity field\nuT (x, t) = A1 (t)u\u03b7 (x) + A2 (t)Ru\u03b7 (RT x) + A3 (t)RT u\u03b7 (Rx) ;\n\n(6)\n\nNote that this model corresponds to a switching angle of 120\u25e6 , not 60\u25e6 . However, we shall see in\n\u00a75 that the roll (1) has a reflection symmetry through the origin in the xy plane, thus these two\nare equivalent.\nWhen the amplitudes are constant and equal, this velocity field gives the (rotating) classical\nhexagonal convection cell\nuh (x) = u\u03b7 (x) + Ru\u03b7 (RT x) + RT u\u03b7 (Rx) ,\n\n(7)\n\nThe orbits of this autonomous system are either periodic or heteroclinic connecting equilibria on\nthe upper and lower boundaries [25].\n4\n\n\f3\n\nThe Blinking Roll Map\n\nThe simplest model of sequential rolls corresponds to roll amplitudes that are periodic step functions. Motivated by the experiments, as well as by simplicity, we assume that both the strength\nand the the activation time of each roll is the same. In this case we can rescale time, setting At \u2192 t\nso that the roll amplitudes become one. The scaled roll activation time, T , thus represents both\nthe strength and period of the flow. In this case the roll amplitudes are\n\u001a\n1, for (j \u2212 1)T \u2264 t < jT ,\nAj (t) =\n.\n(8)\n0, otherwise\nfor 0 \u2264 t < N T and periodically repeating thereafter.\nWhen the amplitude is constant, the flow for the vector field (3) can be solved exactly in terms\nof Jacobi elliptic functions. To get the flow for the tilted roll, we use the \u03b7 = 0 solutions of [9] and\nnote note that in (1), \u1e8b = tan(\u03b7)\u1e8f, giving\n\u0002\n\u0003 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nx + tan(\u03b7) sgn(y) cos\u22121 \u03b4 \u2212 y\n\uf8f8 ,\nsgn(y) cos\u22121 \u03b4\n\u03a6t (x) = \uf8ed\n(9)\n\u22121\nsin \u03c7\nwhere\ncos(y)cn(t)dn(t) + sn(t) sin(z) sin2 (y)\n,\n1 \u2212 cos2 (y)sn2 (t)\nsin(z)cn(t)dn(t) \u2212 sn(t) cos(y) cos2 (z)\n,\n\u03c7(y, z, t) \u2261\n1 \u2212 sin2 (z)sn2 (t)\n\u03b4(y, z, t) \u2261\n\nand the elliptic functions have modulus\nk=\n\nq\n1 \u2212 sin2 y cos2 z .\n\n(10)\n\nBy setting t = T in (9), we get the time-T map\nF (x) = \u03a6T (x) .\n\n(11)\n\nThe effective map for the other rolls can be obtained from (11) by rotation. For example in the\nthree-roll case the resulting mapping is\nf = (R \u25e6 F )3 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe map f corresponds to the flow of (6) over the time 3T . Note that since the vector field is\nincompressible, the map f is volume preserving. Thus, the determinant of the Jacobian, Df , is\nequal to one.\nDifferent values of \u0398 can can be easily accommodated by the map by replacing R with R(\u0398).\n\u0398\nWhen 2\u03c0\nis irrational, we simply repeatedly iterate R(\u0398) \u25e6 F .\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nContinuous-Time Models\n\nOne simple model of the temporal dependence of the amplitudes of three rolls is the Busse and\nHeikes model [18],\n\u02261 = A1 (1 \u2212 |A1 |2 \u2212 \u03b1|A2 |2 \u2212 \u03b2|A3 |2 )\n\u02262 = A2 (1 \u2212 |A2 |2 \u2212 \u03b1|A3 |2 \u2212 \u03b2|A1 |2 )\n2\n\n2\n\n(13)\n\n2\n\n\u02263 = A3 (1 \u2212 |A3 | \u2212 \u03b1|A1 | \u2212 \u03b2|A2 | ) .\nWhen \u03b1 and \u03b2 are positive, this system has a heteroclinic cycle between three states. This model\ncould also include evolution of the phases of the rolls, but we assume that these are constant.\nA thorough review of the dynamic properties of (13) is given in [19]. When \u03b1 > 1 > \u03b2, there\nexists an attracting heteroclinic cycle connecting the saddle equilibria, i.e. the pure roll states:\n(A1 , A2 , A3 ) = (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1). The presence of the attracting equilibria yields a\nsystem that spends increasing amounts of time around the unstable roll states. This feature is not\nphysical, since experimental observations suggest a characteristic period of oscillation associated\nwith a K\u00fcppers-Lortz state. Busse and Heikes offered several ideas for overcoming this problem.\nOne proposal involves the introduction of small amplitude noise into (13) designed to simulate the\nmissing terms in the true amplitude equations. Noisy perturbations of attracting heteroclinic cycles\nwere first studied in [28]. Perturbations of this type prevent the system from spending increasing\namounts of time about any one of the saddle equilibria [19]. The noisy system has a statistically\n\"stable\" limit cycle with a well-defined mean period. A second suggestion is to add slow spatial\nvariation to the amplitude [29]. Adding terms of form \u2202x2i Ai to each equation in (13) respectively\nalso creates a stable oscillation, although its period is difficult to predict.\nWe implement the stochastic method by adding the derivative of small white noise terms, \u03bei (t),\nto (13). Specifically, the \u03bei (t) are Wiener processes with mean 2\u000f and variance \u000f2 . The mean is\nnonzero to help avoid pushing the amplitudes out of the positive octant 2 . Time series are obtained\nusing a second-order stochastic Runge-Kutta solver [30, 31]. Noise causes the orbit to be pushed\naway from the unstable single roll solutions, preventing it from spending arbitrarily long durations\nnear any of those states.\nDetailed pictures of the asymptotically periodic evolution are shown in Fig. 1. The model has\nthree parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u000f that can be chosen to control mean period, shape, and symmetry of\nthe amplitude waveforms. The curves in Fig. 1a and c show typical realizations of the amplitude\nevolution; the solid curves correspond to much smaller values of \u000f than the dashed curves 3 . In\nFig. 1b and d, probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the periods are shown. For the first\ncase the mean period, \u03c4switch is close to 1.5, while in the second it is close to 3. For each case, a step\nsize, \u2206t, was chosen so that there were roughly 300 steps per period. The PDFs were computed\nusing \u223c 105 periods of a single realization. In both cases, the probability distribution functions for\nthe period appear to be nearly Gaussian.\nLet \u03c4roll denote the typical scaled turnover time of a single roll (when A = 1, \u03c4roll = \u03c0 2 , see\n2\n\nThough there is a small chance of getting kicked into the unphysical quadrants when the integrations are close\nto the coordinate planes, in practice, choosing mean 2\u000f appears sufficient to prevent this.\n3\nIn the numerical work of \u00a76, the waveforms in Fig. 1a and c will be used with tilt angles \u03b7 = 65\u25e6 and \u03b7 = 0\u25e6 in\n(6) respectively.\n\n6\n\n\fb\n\na\n\n350\n\n1\n\n300\n\n800\n\n0.8\n\nd\n\nc\n\n1000\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n600\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n400\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n200\n\n0.2\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nt\n\n1.5\n\n0\n1.496\n\n1.498\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c4 switch\n\n1.502\n\n0\n0\n\n1.504\n\n50\n1\n\n2\n\nt\n\n3\n\n0\n2.98\n\n2.99\n\n3\n\n\u03c4 switch\n\n3.01\n\n3.02\n\nFigure 1: Stochastic Busse-Heikes model with parameters given in Table 1.

The time \u03c4switch measures the effective strength of the rolls; consequently when\n\u03c4switch\n<< 1 ,\n\u03c4roll\n\n(14)\n\nthe strength of the rolls is relatively weak. As this parameter grows the rolls become stronger.\nLet \u03c4trans denote the typical transition time between roll states (e.g., the transition time between\n\u25e6\n0 and 120\u25e6 states). If the ratio of transition time to switching time is small:\n\u03c4trans\n<< 1 ,\n\u03c4switch\n\n(15)\n\nthen a relatively large time is spent in a particular roll state compared to the transition to the next\nroll. The parameter \u000f is the key to controlling this ratio; indeed, comparing the solid and dashed\ncurves in in Fig. 1, it is clear that as \u000f grows this inequality becomes invalid.\n\n5\n\nGeometry\n\nSince the vertical component of the velocity (1) vanishes at z = \u00b1\u03c0/2, the orbits are confined to\nthe infinite domain\nn\n\u03c0\n\u03c0o\nD = (x, y, z) : \u2212 \u2264 z \u2264\n.\n(16)\n2\n2\nAs we will review below, the velocity field (6) is invariant under a discrete translational symmetry generated by the unit vectors\n!\n\u221a\n1 3\n\u00fb1 = (1, 0, 0) , \u00fb2 =\n,\n,0 .\n2 2\n7\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\ny= 2\u03c0\n\n+\n\ny= 0\n\ny\n\n+\n\n+\n\ny= \u22122\u03c0\n\n+\nx\n\nFigure 2: Schematic of the roll geometry in z = 0 plane.

The + signs denote right-handed or positive rotation about its axis. The hexagon, H\nis a fundamental cell of the flow.\nThese vectors generate the planar \"wallpaper\" group denoted by p3:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n4\u03c0\np3 = tmn (x) = x + \u221a (m\u00fb1 + n\u00fb2 ) : m, n \u2208 Z .\n3\n\n(17)\n\ncorresponding to a single, order-three axis of symmetry. Here we have scaled the length of the\nvectors to correspond with the unit cell size\n\u221a in our examples. This group has a fundamental cell\nthat is a regular hexagon, H, of width 4\u03c0/ 3 and height 8\u03c0/3, see Fig. 2.\nRegardless of the choice of time dependence for the amplitudes, the vector field (6) has a fourteen\nsaddle equilibria on the upper and lower boundaries, z = \u00b1 \u03c02 ; these are shown as the dots in Fig. 2.\nEach vertically separated pair is connected\nby an invariant line giving a heteroclinic connection.\n\u0001\nFor example, the saddles at 0, 0, \u00b1 \u03c02 are connected by the invariant line {x = y = 0}. Along\nthis heteroclinic connection, the fluid motion is downward. The remaining twelve saddles can be\nfound on the boundary of H, six at z = \u03c0/2 and six at z = \u2212\u03c0/2. There are heteroclinic orbits\nconnecting these pairs that move\n\u0011 there is an upward moving heteroclinic\n\u0010 upward.\u0011 For\u0010 example,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nconnection between the points \u221a3 , 0, \u2212 2 to \u221a3 , 0, 2 .\nNote that since the map (12) is an exact solution of (6) for the special case of step function amplitudes, the equilibria and heteroclinic connections of the flow become fixed points and heteroclinic\nlines of the map.\n\n8\n\n\f6\n\nNumerical Explorations\n\nIn this section we study the mixing and transport for the flow (6) and compare it to that for the\nblinking roll mapping (12). One local measure of mixing corresponds to the Lyapunov exponents\nas a function of initial condition. There is a correlation between large exponents and regions of\nstrong mixing. On the other hand in regions with many invariant tori, the exponents are zero or\nnear zero.\nA second measure is the rate of particle drift throughout the domain. A first goal is to distinguish\nbetween bounded and unbounded orbits. We will study those bounded orbits that remain within\nthe fundamental domain H-we call these orbits \"trapped.\" Generally the \"regular\" orbits appear\nto be trapped (for example, those on invariant tori), especially for the case T1 = T2 = T3 ; however,\nthere appear to be bounded invariant structures larger than a single fundamental domain when the\nmapping times are not equal. We will also compute the exit time distribution from a fundamental\ndomain. Transport of unbounded orbits can be quantified by computing the growth rate of distance\nwith t and comparing this to diffusive behavior. Since the trajectories are bounded in z, we measure\nthe drift in (x, y) by looking at the growth rate of r2 = x2 + y 2 .\n\n6.1\n\nLyapunov Phase Portraits\n\nIn this section, we compute the three Lyapunov exponents, (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 ), as a function of initial\ncondition for both the flow and map models. Ideally we would compute the exponents for each\ninitial condition on a three-dimensional mesh covering the fundamental cell, but this would be\nprohibitively expensive in computation time and the results would be difficult to display. Instead,\nwe use two, two-dimensional slices in the fundamental cell H: the horizontal midplane, z = 0, and\nthe vertical cross section, y = 0. The horizontal slice is hexagonal and is divided into a 70 \u00d7 70\ngrid and the vertical slice is rectangular and divided into a 100 \u00d7 50 grid.\nSince the map is volume-preserving and the flow is incompressible, the sum \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bc3 = 0 for\nboth models. In Fig. 3, we show only the value of the largest exponent \u03bc1 for each initial condition\non these grids. We call these pictures \"Lyapunov phase portraits;\" they help to differentiate between\nchaotic and regular regions and provide a local measure of chaos that correlates with rapid mixing.\nThe exponents are computed using the QR method of Rangarajan et al [34, 35]. The second and\nthird Lyapunov exponents were also computed for all cases. Typically we observed that |\u03bc2 | \u223c 10\u22124\nwhich is two orders of magnitude smaller than \u03bc1 in the chaotic region. Given that only 105\niterations were used in the computation and that converge is slow, a longer integration might be\nexpected to yield an evan smaller second exponent. Thus our results are consistent with \u03bc2 = 0,\nand consequently with \u03bc3 = \u2212\u03bc1 . Note that an autonomous flow always has a zero exponent. More\ngenerally, if the flow or map were reversible then we would also expect \u03bc2 = 0. We have not been\nable to show, however, that our systems are reversible, and thus do not have an explanation for\nthe near vanishing of \u03bc2 .\nBy computing the Lyapunov phase portraits for both the flow (6) and the map (12), a direct\ncomparison can be made between the two dynamical systems if the parameter values are equivalent.\nFor the flow we use a full integration of the stochastic Busse-Heikes model to generate the amplitude\nwaveforms; those shown in Fig. 1 give a typical cycle. Since there are three blinking-rolls per map\niteration, the corresponding parameter T for the mapping is one third of the average period of the\namplitude functions.\n9\n\n\fTable 1: Parameters for the Lyapunov phase portraits of Fig. 3\nFig. 3\na\nb\nc,d\ne\nf\ng,h\n\nModel\nflow\nflow\nmap\nflow\nflow\nmap\n\n\u03b7\n65\n65\n65\n0\n0\n0\n\n\u03b1\n29.9205\n12.7503\n\n\u03b2\n\u221227.9005\n\u221210.7303\n\n\u000f\n10\u221214\n10\u22127\n\n\u221216.0025\n\u22123.7360\n\n10\u221216\n\n\u2206t\n.005\n.005\n\nPeriod\n1.5\n1.5\n\nT\n\n.5\n18.0225\n5.7560\n\n10\u22128\n\n.01\n.01\n\n3\n3\n1\n\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding parameter values are given in Table 1. In\neach case the total time corresponds to approximately 105 oscillation cycles. The average period of\noscillation is approximately 1.5 for the first two flow cases (panels (a) and (b)), and we choose the\ncorresponding mapping time in panel (c) to be 0.5 so that the total integration time represented\nby iterating the map 105 times is the same as that for the flow. For panels (e) and (f) the average\nperiod is 3.0, and the corresponding mapping time T = 1.0 is used in panel (g). 4\nResults for the flow with \u03b7 = 65\u25e6 are displayed in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b. The amplitude waveforms\nin these two cases differ in their shapes, as shown by the solid and dashed curves in Fig. 1. The\nimages indicate that there are toroidal regions of near zero Lyapunov exponent surrounded by a\nchaotic sea. The breaks in the toroidal region on the hexagonal slice correspond to locations where\nthe torus does not intersect this slice. It is striking that the tori exist even when the three amplitude\nwaveforms have significant intervals of overlap as they do for Fig. 3b. This suggests that the details\nof the amplitude wave form is not a critical factor in the existence of the tori. The corresponding\nLyapunov phase portrait for the map, shown in Fig. 3c, is visually quite similar to (and as shown\nin Table 2 has a high correlation with) the first two flow cases. In Fig. 3e and Fig. 3f, the Lyapunov\nphase portraits are shown for the waveforms in Fig. 1c with \u03b7 = 0\u25e6 . Once again, these portraits\nshow a high correlation with those for the corresponding mapping, shown in Fig. 3g. Although\nthe \u03b7 = 0\u25e6 case is nonphysical for rotating convection, it is interesting to see that the toroidal\nstructures persist for small \u03b7 and are robust as this parameter varies.\nA few orbits inside the regions of low chaos (red, blue, and green) and one in the chaotic region\n(purple) are shown in Fig. 3d for (12). The regions of near-zero Lyapunov exponent correspond\nto a set of nested two-dimensional tori. At the center of this nested set is apparently an elliptic,\ninvariant curve. The green orbit in Fig. 3h appears to correspond to a torus that encloses an\ninvariant curve that is helically wound about the central family of tori.\nIn each case, the close correlation between the Lyapunov exponents of the flow and mapping\nis clear from the pictures. To quantify this connection, we computed the correlation coefficient\nbetween the values of \u03bc1 for mapping and for the flow on each slice. The results are given in\nTable 2; coefficients near one indicate similar structure whereas coefficients near zero suggest large\ndifferences between the data sets. In each case, a reasonably strong correlation is obtained. It\n4\n\nThe average computation time was about 4 cpu days for the flow. Computations were performed on a 4 processor,\n64 bit, Itanium 2 1.3GHz (32KB L1 cache, 256 KB L2 cache, 3MB L3 cache) architecture. In contrast, the Lyapunov\nexponents for the discrete maps took 2 \u2212 3 cpu hours on the same machine.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 3: Lyapunov phase portraits for the flow (6) and map (12) for the parameter values given\nin Table 1.

Sample trajectories of the mapping are given in panels\n(d) and (h) showing regions occupied by invariant tori.

This seems to predominantly\noccur near the outer boundary of the regular regions where the step function approximation to\nthe amplitudes does a poor job of approximating the flow: the map tends to have a larger region\nfoliated by invariant tori than does the flow.\nAs computations with the map are much quicker than those for the flow it is easier to investigate\nthe effect of changing parameters on the map. Moreover, changing the switching angle \u0398 from\n120\u25e6 is problematic for the flow since the three-mode model (13) no longer applies. It is very\neasy, however, to change the switching angle in the map by choosing the rotation angle for the\ntransformation R in (12). One of the immediate observations is that tori are robust features of the\nmapping as the switching and tilt angles and time step T are varied. For example, a large family of\ntori can be seen Fig. 4a (viewed from a camera looking down from large z). For this case the ratio\n(14) is small. The size of the innermost torus shown is on the order of one hexagonal convection\ncell; however, since \u0398 6= 120\u25e6 the system no longer has hexagonal symmetry. Outside these tori,\nthe motion is chaotic and diffusive (not shown in the figure).\nA final example in Fig. 4b shows a number of helical tori enclosing the central family. In the\ncenter of the light gray orbits are invariant curves that wind twice in the toroidal direction before\nreturning to their original positions. It is possible that these families of tori are created by perioddoubling bifurcations of the invariant curve at the center of the main torus or a resonant bifurcation\nof a two-torus, but we have not verified this.\nThere are too many parameters in the system to completely explore the full range of possible\ndynamics. A critical point is that the discrete symmetry does not produce the tori: these structures\nare features of the flow for many parameter values.\n\n6.2\n\nBreakdown of Integrability\n\nWhen the time T is very small, it is easy to see that the map (12) is, to first order in T , the same\nas the time-T map of the autonomous field (7). Thus for a fixed total iteration time, we expect\nthat the map dynamics will limit on the integrable flow of (7) as T \u2192 0. Indeed, we observe that\nthe mapping shows the same closed, integrable trajectories of the classical hexagonal convection\npatterns [25] when T approaches zero for a given fixed total time nT .\nAs T grows, the closed trajectories are destroyed and are replaced by nested invariant tori\nseparated by small zones of chaos as illustrated in Fig. 5. This example shows six families of\n5\n\nHere \u03c4trans is computed by finding the total time t that Ai (t) > .95 or Ai (t) < .05 for i = 1, 2, 3. This value is\nsubtracted from \u03c4switch .\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 4: Phase portraits of (12) for (a) T = .2, \u03b7 = 65\u25e6 , and \u0398 = 122\u25e6 , and (b) T = 1, \u03b7 = 0\u25e6 ,\n\u0398 = 45\u25e6 .

The poloidal tori can be seen crossing\nthe z = 0 section in the Lyapunov phase portrait of panel (a) near the center and edges of the\nhexagon. Invariant curves at the center of the poloidal and toroidal families of tori, shown in panel\n(b), can be found using the simple algorithm discussed in Appendix B. A trajectory in the chaotic\nregion between the tori is shown in a top down view in panel (c). This domain can also be seen as\nthe light grey regions in the Lyapunov phase portrait of panel (a).\nThis same structure is seen when T is small for any value of \u03b7. As \u03b7 increases the tori becomes\nincreasingly twisted in the same manner as the classical hexagons. For each \u03b7, as T is further\nincreased, the six poloidal tori disappear leaving only the toroidal family. Eventually the toroidal\nfamily is destroyed as well and the cell appears to be completely chaotic (e.g. Fig. 6d below). In\nTable 3, the largest value of T for which the map has visible tori is given as a function of \u03b7. For these\nT values, the central invariant curves are warped and twisted (see Fig. 6a) and the surrounding\ntwo-tori have a small poloidal diameter.

As\nT \u2192 0 the invariant curve approaches the closed curve of the autonomous flow of (7) given by\n\u221a !\n\u0010y \u0011\n3x\ncos(y) + 2 cos\n=0.\n(18)\ncos\n2\n2\nThis is shown as the darkest black curve at z = 0. For larger T values the invariant curve becomes\nincreasingly distorted, and appears to lose differentiability. The curve is destroyed for T \u2248 1.81.\nFor larger values of T , as shown in panel (c), the phase portrait appears to be completely chaotic.\nPanel (b) shows the longitudinal rotation number of the invariant curves, \u03c9, as a function of T . As\nT \u2192 0, \u03c9 \u2192 0 since the mapping limits to a time T map of the autonomous flow. As T increases\nthe rotation number grows monotonically. There are gaps in the rotation number corresponding to\nparameter intervals where the curve is destroyed and reforms.\nThe six poloidal tori shown in Fig. 5 also appear to arise from streamlines of the autonomous,\nhexagonal flow (7) as T increases from zero. Symmetry implies that they appear in the planes\nx = 0 and y = 0 and their rotations by \u03c0/3. When \u03b7 = 0, the streamlines of (7) in these planes\ncorrespond to contours of the functions\n\u0010 \u0011 \u0012 1 + 2 cos( y ) \u00132\n2 y\n2\n\u03a81 (0, y, z) = cos(z) sin\n(19)\n2\n1 + cos( y2 )\n\u221a !\n\u221a !! 23\n2\n3x\n3x\n\u03a82 (x, 0, z) = cos(z) sin 3\n1 \u2212 cos\n,\n(20)\n2\n2\n14\n\n\frespectively. When \u03b7 6= 0, a closed form expression for the streamlines is difficult to find. Using\nT = 10\u22124 and the center of mass algorithm, computations show that the invariant curves at\nthe center of the six elliptic tori limit onto the streamline defined by \u03a81 \u2248 0.3868 This streamline\npresumably is selected by a mechanism similar to the classical Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff island chain created\nin when an integrable area-preserving map is perturbed.\nJust as in the two-dimensional, island chain case, one of the \u03a82 streamlines apparently becomes\na hyperbolic (saddle) invariant curve in the same manner that the \u03a81 = 0.3868 streamline becomes\nan elliptic invariant\u221a\ncurve. Indeed, numerical computations show localized chaos around the planes\ny = 0 and y = \u00b1 3x (recall Fig. 5a and c) that grow as T increases from zero. Transverse\nintersections of the stable and unstable manifolds of these saddle curves provide a mechanism for\nthe onset of three-dimensional chaos [46].\nThe disappearance of the elliptic invariant curves as T increases is expected to be caused by\nvarious resonant bifurcations between their longitudinal and transverse rotation numbers. This\nhypothesis is supported by the observation that the regular region surrounding the elliptic curves\nshrinks as they approach destruction. We hope to report further on these bifurcations in a future\npaper.\n\n6.3\n\nTransport\n\nWhile Lyapunov exponents measure the divergence of neighboring trajectories, they give no information about how trajectories disperse over macroscopic distances, that is about \"transport.\" The\ngoal of this section is to develop several measures of transport.\nA first distinction to make is between trajectories that are bounded and those that are not.\nOne class of bounded orbits are those that remain forever trapped in a single fundamental cell,\nH. These, for example, include some of the invariant tori that we previously studied, though it\nis possible for invariant tori to exist on scales larger than a single cell. Since some trajectories\nnever leave H, it is reasonable to restrict the calculation to the set of initial conditions whose\ntrajectories eventually do leave; this set is equivalent, up to a set of zero volume, to the subset that\nis \"accessible\" to trajectories that begin outside H [36]. The accessible set can be constructed by\nconsidering the incoming set Hin which is defined to be\nHin = H \\ F (H) ,\ni.e., the portion of H that does not intersect F (H). According to this definition, F \u22121 (Hin ) is outside\nof H, thus every point in Hin has just entered H. The accessible portion of H is the portion that\ncan be reached by starting in the incoming set:\nHacc =\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nF t (Hin ) \u2229 H .\n\nt=0\n\nIn order to leave H, a trajectory must first land in the exit set\nHexit = H \\ F \u22121 (H) .\nBy volume preservation, the incoming and exit sets have the same volume.\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 7: Exit time and mean square displacement with parameters given in Table 1 (a) Exit time\ndistribution for a 1000\u00d71000\u00d7500 grid in fundamental cell. (b) Mean-squared displacement for 104\nrandomly sampled points in Hexit . (c) Mean-squared displacement for the flow (6) with amplitudes\ngiven in for 103 randomly sampled points in Hexit .\nA simple measure of transport is the \"exit time distribution,\" \u03c8(t), defined to be the probability\nthat a trajectory that starts in Hin at t = 0, first leaves H at time t. To compute this we cover H\nwith a grid of points. Each point is iterated with the inverse map to see if it remains in H-if so,\nit is discarded. The remaining points are in the incoming set, and they are iterated forward until\nthey exit H.\nExit time distributions for hyperbolic systems are typically exponential; however, it is common\nin volume-preserving dynamics for \u03c8 to have a power-law form [21]:\n\u03c8(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b3 .\n\n(21)\n\nFor the case of a volume-preserving map, it is a consequence of Kac's theorem that the average exit\ntime\nZ \u221e\n\u03c4exit =\nt\u03c8(t)dt ,\n(22)\n0\n\no(t\u22122 )\n\nexists [36]. Thus \u03c8(t) =\nas t \u2192 \u221e. The computations of exit time distributions, shown in\nFig. 7a, are consistent with (21) and \u03b3 \u2248 2.1 \u2212 2.5. In each case, as the theory requires, \u03c4exit < \u221e\nsince the distribution has power law tail with \u03b3 > 2.\nChaotic trajectories that leave the fundamental cell tend to have unbounded orbits (though as we\nhave seen there can also be superstructures extending over several copies of H). One measure of the\ntransport properties of unbounded trajectories is the growth rate of the mean-squared displacement,\ni.e.\nhr2 (t)i \u223c t\u03bc .\n(23)\nThe case \u03bc = 1 corresponds to diffusive motion; however, many dynamical systems exhibit either\nsubdiffusive (\u03bc < 1) or superdiffusive (\u03bc > 1) behavior [37]. Anomalous diffusion has been observed\nin many systems, for example, in two [39, 40] and three-dimensional fluids [7], plasma physics [38],\nand electron transport on semiconductor superlattices [41].\n16\n\n\fOne phenomenological model that gives anomalous diffusion of the form of (23) is a continuous\ntime random walk. In this model particles are assumed to move from one point to another under\na sequence of \"L\u00e9vy flights\" whose length and duration are taken from probability distributions\nwith power law tails. Such models display both normal and superdiffusive behavior [42, 43, 44]. A\ntrapping probability distribution, separating jumps by trapping events in which the particle remains\nat its current position for a randomly selected time can also be added to the model-in our case\nthis distribution is \u03c8(t). For this situation, the dynamics can also exhibit subdiffusive behavior.\nSubdiffusion occurs when the motion is dominated by trapping events, and superdiffusion when\nflights are the more influential factor [45].\nFor our model the average exit time is finite; consequently, if there are no flights, one can\nexpect normally diffusive behavior [47]. Though it is not easy to directly measure the distribution\nof particles undergoing so-called \"L\u00e9vy flights,\" we can compute the mean squared growth rate\n\u03bc, (23). To do this we randomly sample 104 points in Hexit , iterating each 105 times. We also\ncompute the mean square displacement for the continuous system, though in this case, since much\ncomputation is involve we only use 103 initial points and integrate for 104 periods. In both cases\nthe results, shown in Fig. 7, are consistent with \u03bc = 1 however \u03bc = 1 does not always fall within\nthe 90% confidence interval. However, the least squares technique for computing the asymptotic\ngrowth rate may not give an accurate estimate of the error. In general though, it appears that these\nmodels are normally diffusive and that there are no L\u00e9vy flights, unlike many similar dynamical\nsystems.\n\n7\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have studied two idealized, kinematic models of the K\u00fcppers-Lortz state. The building blocks\nof the models are vortical roll arrays whose axes are rotated through an angle \u0398 with respect to one\nanother. In the continuous-time construction, the time dependence of the amplitude of the rolls\nis controlled by a stochastic Busse-Heikes system (13). When the amplitudes of the rolls are step\nfunctions and the rolls switch instantaneously from one set to another, we derived an analytical\nmap, (12).\nAt the simplest level, the transition to chaos is governed by the the ratio of switching time,\n\u03c4switch , to turnover turnover time, \u03c4roll . As this parameter goes to zero, the flow approaches the\nautonomous, integrable case and when it is sufficiently small, the dynamics is similar, showing the\nclassical hexagonal patterns observed in rotating Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection.\nAs this ratio grows, both the flow and the map have a family of invariant tori surrounding an\nelliptic invariant curve. Outside these tori is a chaotic sea. The tori undergo a complex sequence of\nbifurcations as the parameters change that we hope to report on in a future paper. In some cases\nwe have also observed localized mixing for trajectories trapped within an invariant torus. This\noccurs, for example, if the central invariant curve is temporarily destroyed by a bifurcation, but\nthe surrounding two-tori persist.\nFor large values of the the switching time, the Lyapunov phase portraits indicate nearly complete mixing. We characterized the transport properties of our system by computing the mean\nexit-time from the fundamental cell and the mean-squared drift of trajectories over the extended\ndomain. Computations for the blinking-roll mapping and the flow showed algebraic decay of the\nexit time distribution, and the mean-squared growth consistent with normal diffusion. These re17\n\n\fsults, in conjunction with anomalous diffusion theory, suggest that there is no analogue of the open\nstreamlines in an autonomous flow or the \"accelerator modes\" of area-preserving maps that would\neffect long range, superdiffusive transport.\nWe also showed that the dynamics of the flow and map models is highly correlated even when\nthe switching time is far from instantaneous. This observation suggests that a much broader class\nof continuous-time models, perhaps with periodic switching between more than three states, can be\naccurately modeled with the blinking roll mapping. With this in mind, one could easily extend the\nblinking roll system to include more realistic spatial descriptions for the flow, like Chandrasekhar\nfunctions, which are solutions to the linearized Boussinesq approximation with a no-slip lower\nboundary condition. However, it would be more difficult to obtain an explicit mapping and the\ncomputations would consequently be slower. For the simple case explored here, the Lyapunov phase\nportraits can be computed about twenty times faster for the map than for the flow.\nThe mapping has tori over a wide range of switching and tilt angles. We explored some of their\nbehavior, but many mysteries remain. For instance, the middle Lyapunov exponent appears to\nbe zero to numerical accuracy for both the continuous and discrete models. While this would be\nrigorously true for autonomous flows or reversible maps, we do not have an explanation of this for\nour systems. In addition, it would be interesting to study in detail the bifurcations that give rise to\nthe families of invariant tori and curves, as well as those that ultimately lead to their destruction.\nNumerical studies show that destruction of invariant curves and tori typically enhances the mixing,\nbut as of yet there is no satisfactory theory of transport for these three-dimensional systems.\n\nA\n\nAppendix: Mean Roll Turnover Time\n\nHere, we compute the average roll turnover time, \u03c4roll , for a single roll with streamfunction \u03c8 =\nsin(y) cos(z). Suppose an initial condition is placed along the line z = 0, 0 < y = y0 < \u03c02 . The flow\nalong this streamline is given by (9) (with \u03b7 = 0):\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\ncos(y0 )cn(t)dn(t)\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03a6t (x, y0 , 0) = x, sgn(y0 ) cos\n, sin (\u2212sn(t) cos(y0 )) .\n(24)\n1 \u2212 cos2 (y0 )sn2 (t)\nNow, solve for the t value such that\n\u0010 \u03c0\n\u03c0\u0011\n.\n\u03a6t (x, y0 , 0) = x, , y0 \u2212\n2\n2\nThis corresponds to one quarter of a rotation around\n\b a given streamfunction. This is possible since\nthe tracers rotate counterclockwise in the domain (x, y) : 0 \u2264 y \u2264 \u03c0, \u2212 \u03c02 \u2264 z \u2264 \u03c02 . From the third\ncomponent, we find a simple equation for t:\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\nt = sn\u22121 (1, k) = F\n,k .\n2\nHere, the modulus of the elliptic functions is (10) and F ( \u03c02 , k) is the complete elliptic integral of\nthe first kind. To get the average roll turnover time for all streamfunctions, we integrate over k to\nfind [48]:\nZ 1 \u0010\n\u03c0 \u0011\n\u03c4roll = 4\nF\n, k dk = \u03c0 2 .\n2\n0\nIt is straightforward to show that \u03c4roll is independent of \u03b7.\n18\n\n\fB\n\nAppendix: Finding Invariant Curves\n\nLocating invariant curves is a more challenging task than finding fixed or periodic points of a\nmap. For a map, the dynamics on an invariant curve is typically conjugate to a rigid rotation with\nirrational winding number. Therefore, one cannot use standard root finding techniques since the\norbit never returns to itself. Though there are many standard algorithms for finding periodic orbits,\nmethods for finding quasiperiodic ones are not as well developed. One algorithm uses Newton's\nmethod coupled with an interpolation algorithm to find a single point on an invariant curve [49].\nIn another, the curve is approximated by a finite Forier series and Newton's method is used to\nsolve for the coefficients [50]. This this method is hindered by the assumption of conjugacy to rigid\nrotation number with an a priori known rotation number.\nWe use a simple algorithm that computes a single point on the invariant curve; however, only\none point is needed since the rest of the invariant curve can be found through iteration. The method\nis limited because it only works for the case of an elliptic invariant curve, and it is rather slow. On\nthe other hand, the method has significant advantages in that it does not require foreknowledge of\nthe rotation number \u03c9 and it is easy to implement.\nThe first step is to choose an appropriate plane that is expected to intersect the invariant curve\ntransversely. We fatten this plane into a thin slice of width \u000f and choose a point x0 in the slice close\nto where the curve is expected. Iterate the initial point and record the times it lands within the\nslice. Once N such near returns are found, we compute the center of mass of these points, x\u0304. If the\nelliptic curve is surrounded by a family of two-tori, and these have a convex intersection with the\nslice then x\u0304 will approximate the position of the enclosed invariant curve. We now decrease \u000f and\nrepeat the process with x0 = x\u0304 as the new starting position. This procedure appears to work well\nto find a point on the invariant curve to machine precision. Given this point, we can now iterate\nto find the longitudinal rotation number \u03c9 of the curve.\n\n19\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.M. Ottino. The Kinematics of Mixing: Stretching, Chaos, and Transport.
