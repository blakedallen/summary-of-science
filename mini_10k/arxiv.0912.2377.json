In a Newtonian fluid, it was shown theoretically that such synchronization\narises passively due to hydrodynamic forces between the two swimmers if their waveforms exhibit\na front-back geometrical asymmetry. Motivated by the fact that most biological fluids possess a\npolymeric microstructure, we address here synchronization in a viscoelastic fluid analytically. Using\na two-dimensional infinite sheet model we show that the presence of polymeric stresses removes\nthe geometrical asymmetry constraint, and therefore even symmetric swimmers synchronize. Such\nsynchronization occurs on asymptotically faster time scales than in a Newtonian fluid, and the swimmers are seen to be driven into a stable in-phase conformation minimizing the energy dissipated in\nthe surrounding fluid.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSwimming microorganisms are found everywhere in nature, from bacteria moving towards nutrients, to spermatozoa\nmigrating towards an ovum. Given their size, they swim in a realm where viscous stresses predominate and inertia is\nnegligible. This fact often necessitates strategies for locomotion which are vastly different from those of organisms in\nthe macroscopic world [1]. Much progress has been made in the physical and hydrodynamic analysis of microscopic\nswimming [2\u20134], yet many marked phenomena are still of current interest. One such phenomenon is the experimentallyobserved synchronization of spermatozoa flagella (slender filaments deformed in a wavelike fashion and propelling the\ncells forward) when swimming in close proximity [5, 6]. This synchronization has been observed to prompt an\nincrease in the swimming speed of the co-swimming cells which could thereby provide a competitive, and hence\nperhaps evolutionary, advantage [6]. The theoretical analysis of the synchronization of swimming microorganisms in\nNewtonian fluids dates back to the work of Taylor who, assuming two infinite and parallel two-dimensional sheets,\nshowed that synchronous beating minimizes the viscous dissipation between the model cells [7]. This synchronization\nwas subsequently demonstrated computationally for both infinite [8], and finite two-dimensional models [9]. Recently,\nit was shown that phase-locking arises purely passively due to the fluid forces between the two swimmers, and requires\na front-back asymmetry in the flagellar geometry of the cells without which no synchronization can occur [10].\nIn all previously-studied situations, synchronization was addressed in the case of a Newtonian fluid. However,\nmost biological fluids involved, for example, in mammalian reproduction are non-Newtonian. As mammalian spermatozoa make their journey through the female reproductive tract they encounter several complex fluids, including\nglycoprotein-based cervical mucus in the cervix, mucosal epithelium inside the fallopian tubes, and actin-based viscoelastic gel outside the ovum [11, 12]. In a viscoelastic fluid, kinematic reversibility, restated in Purcell's scallop\ntheorem [1], breaks down due to the presence of normal stresses and shear-dependent material functions, fundamentally altering the governing flow physics [13]. The waveform, structure, and swimming path of spermatozoa have been\nexperimentally observed to be modified in viscoelastic fluids [14]. Locomotion in complex fluids has been studied\nanalytically [15\u201317], and it has been shown that microorganisms which propel themselves by propagating waves along\ntheir flagella have a lower swimming speed in a viscoelastic fluid than in a Newtonian fluid [18, 19].\nIn this paper we study the passive synchronization of two flagellated cells in a viscoelastic (Oldroyd-B) fluid. Using\nTaylor's infinite two-dimensional sheet model, we show that not only does phase locking arise in a viscoelastic fluid,\nbut also that it does not require the front-back geometrical asymmetry that must exist for such a model to display\nsynchronization in a Newtonian fluid. We demonstrate that the system evolves to a single stable fixed point at the\nin-phase conformation, which is also the conformation that yields minimal energy dissipation. In addition, we show\nthat the evolution to a phase-locked state occurs on asymptotically faster time scales than in a Newtonian fluid.\n\n\f2\n\nc\n\nU \u2212 U\u2206 /2\n\n\u03c6 = 0 In-Phase\nh\ny\n\nc\nU + U\u2206 /2\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c0 Opposite-Phase\n\nx\n\n\u03c6\nFIG. 1: Model system consisting of two infinite sinusoidal sheets passing waves at speed c and thereby swimming at speed\nU \u00b1U\u2206 /2 in the opposite direction. The difference in phase \u03c6 incurs a relative velocity U\u2206 (\u03c6, h) between the two sheets denoted\npositive when the top sheet swims to the right relative to the bottom one. The average separation distance is denoted h.\n\nSETUP\n\nOur system, shown in Fig. 1, consists of two parallel infinite two-dimensional sheets, separated by a mean distance\nh. Both sheets propagate sinusoidal waves of transverse displacement of amplitude a at speed c = \u03c9/k, where \u03c9\nis the wave frequency and k is the wavenumber, but have an initial phase difference \u03c60 . By passing these waves,\nthe sheets propel themselves in the direction opposite to the wave speed [7]. The sheets are also permitted to move\nrelative to each other with an unknown velocity U\u2206 , denoted positive when the top sheet (#2) swims in the positive\nx direction relative to the bottom one (#1). The positions of the sheets, in their swimming frames, are thereby given\nRt\nRt\nby y1 = a sin(kx \u2212 \u03c9t \u2212 \u03c60 /2 + 0 kU\u2206 (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 /2) and y2 = h + a sin(kx \u2212 \u03c9t + \u03c60 /2 \u2212 0 kU\u2206 (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 /2).\n\u2217\nWe use the following dimensionless variables x\u0302\u2217 = xk, t\u2217 = t\u03c9, u\u2217 = u/c, U\u2206\n= U\u2206 /c. The amplitude of the waves\nR t\u2217 \u2217 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2217\n(t )dt\nis non-dimensionalized by the wavenumber, \u01eb = ak. For convenience we let x = x\u0302\u2217 \u2212 t\u2217 and \u03c6 = \u03c60 \u2212 0 U\u2206\nwhich is the instantaneous phase difference between the two sheets. The position of the sheets in dimensionless form is\n\u2217\nthus given by y1\u2217 = \u01eb sin(x\u2217 \u2212 \u03c6/2), and y2\u2217 = h\u2217 + \u01eb sin(x\u2217 + \u03c6/2), and the phase evolves in time according to \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212U\u2206\n.\nWe refer to the \u03c6 = 0 conformation as in-phase, and the \u03c6 = \u03c0 conformation as opposite-phase. The system is 2\u03c0\nperiodic and \u03c6 is defined from \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0. We now drop the (\u2217 ) notation and refer only below to dimensionless variables.\nSince this problem is two dimensional, we introduce the streamfunction \u03c8(x, y, t) where the components of the\nvelocity field are u = [u, v]T = [\u2202\u03c8/\u2202y, \u2212\u2202\u03c8/\u2202x]T, and the incompressibility condition is always satisfied. The\nboundary conditions become then\nh\ni\n\u2207\u03c8|y=y1 = \u2207 \u2212 U\u2206 y/2 + \u01eb sin(x \u2212 \u03c6/2)\n,\n(1)\ny=y1\nh\ni\n\u2207\u03c8|y=y2 = \u2207 U\u2206 y/2 + \u01eb sin(x + \u03c6/2)\n.\n(2)\ny=y2\n\nMechanical equilibrium for a low-Reynolds number flow in a viscoelastic fluid is given by \u2207p = \u2207 * \u03c4 , where p is\nthe pressure and \u03c4 is the deviatoric part of the stress tensor. To relate the stress to the strain-rate, we use in this\npaper the simplest polymeric constitutive equation derived from a microscopic theory, namely the Oldroyd-B model\n[20, 21] given by\n\u25bd\n\n\u25bd\n\n\u03c4 + De1 \u03c4 = \u03b3\u0307 + De2 \u03b3\u0307,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0307 = \u2207u + \u2207uT is the strain-rate tensor; the upper convected derivative is defined for a general tensor A as\n\u25bd\n\nA= \u2202A/\u2202t + u * \u2207A \u2212 (\u2207uT * A + A * \u2207u). We have defined two Deborah numbers, De1 = \u03bb1 \u03c9, where \u03bb1 is the\nrelaxation time of the polymer, and De2 = \u03bb2 \u03c9, where \u03bb2 = \u03bb1 \u03b7s /(\u03b7s + \u03b7p ) is the retardation time of the polymer and\n\u03b7s , \u03b7p refer to the contribution to the viscosity from the solvent and polymer respectively [21]. Rheological studies\nhave shown the relaxation time of cervical mucus to be between 1 and 10 seconds [22]. Given that the flagella of\nspermatozoa typically beat at a frequency between 20 and 50 Hz [3] we might expect a range of Deborah numbers\nDe1 = 102 \u2212 103 , and in most practical instances De1 \u226b De2 [21].\nIn the spirit of Taylor's seminal study, we look to solve this system in a small amplitude limit, \u01eb \u226a 1, with a\n\n\f3\nperturbation expansion in powers of \u01eb for stress \u03c4 = \u01eb\u03c4 1 + \u01eb2 \u03c4 2 + ..., strain-rate \u03b3\u0307 = \u01eb\u03b3\u0307 1 + \u01eb2 \u03b3\u0307 2 + ..., streamfunction\n\u03c8 = \u01eb\u03c81 + \u01eb2 \u03c82 + ... and the relative velocity between the sheets U\u2206 = \u01ebU\u22061 + \u01eb2 U\u22062 + ....\nANALYSIS\nFirst-order solution\n\nThe leading order component of (3) is\n\u03c4 1 + De1\n\n\u2202 \u03b3\u0307\n\u2202\u03c4 1\n= \u03b3\u0307 1 + De2 1 *\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\nTaking the divergence and the curl of (4) we get the governing equation for the first-order streamfunction\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u22074 \u03c81 = 0.\n1 + De2\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nWith the first order boundary conditions\n\u2207\u03c81 |y=0 = \u2207 [(\u2212U\u22061 y/2 + sin(x \u2212 \u03c6/2)] |y=0 ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2207\u03c81 |y=h = \u2207 [U\u22061 y/2 + sin(x + \u03c6/2)] |y=h ,\n\n(7)\n\nthe solution can be shown to be\n\u03c81 = a0 (y) + a1 (y) cos(x) + b1 (y) sin(x),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010y\n\u0011\n1\n3\n\u22121 ,\na0 (y) = C1 y 2 y \u2212 h + U\u22061 y\n2\n2\nh\n\u03c6\n\u0010\n\u0011\nsin 2\ny cosh(h \u2212 y) \u2212 (h \u2212 y) cosh y + sinh(h \u2212 y) \u2212 sinh y ,\na1 (y) =\nh \u2212 sinh(h)\n\u0010\n\u0011\ncos \u03c62\nb1 (y) =\ny cosh(h \u2212 y) + (h \u2212 y) cosh y + sinh(h \u2212 y) + sinh y .\nh + sinh(h)\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nTo determine the unknown constant C1 we resort to dynamical considerations. For simplicity\nwe resolve\nthe\ni\nh\n(0)\n(1)\nstreamfunction into its complex Fourier components in the wave variable x = x\u0302 \u2212 t giving \u03c81 = R \u03c8\u03031 + \u03c8\u03031 , where\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\nR[...] denotes the real part and \u03c8 \u03031 = a0 (y) and \u03c8\u03031 = (a1 (y)+ib1 (y))e\u2212ix . The strain-rate tensor, \u03b3\u0307 1 = \u2207u1 +\u2207uT\n1,\ncan then be obtained using (8). Exploiting (4), we see that the first-order stress tensor is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 + iDe2  \u0303 (1)\n \u0303 (0)\n.\n(12)\n\u03c4 1 = R \u03b3\u0307\n\u03b3\u0307\n+\n1\n1 + iDe1 1\nIf \u03c3 = \u2212p1 + \u03c4 refers to the total stress tensor, integration of \u2207 * \u03c3 = 0 leads to the sum of the forces, f , on the upper\nand lower sheets (over a period) equal to zero, i.e. f |y=y1 + f |y=y2 = 0. At leading order, the horizontal component\nof this relationship is\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03c41xy |y=0 dx =\n\u03c41xy |y=h dx,\n(13)\n0\n\n0\n\nwhich yields C1 = 0. We finally determine the relative velocity by insisting the sheets be force-free. Typically, for\neach sheet, one must sum the forces on both the inner and outer surfaces. However, the outer problem is force-free\nfor all U\u22061 [18]. The net force on the upper sheet is therefore given by\nZ 2\u03c0\nf1x = \u2212\na\u2032\u20320 (h)dx = \u22122\u03c0U\u22061 /h,\n(14)\n0\n\n\f4\nand hence U\u22061 is zero, which is expected due to the \u01eb \u2192 \u2212\u01eb symmetry of the system. With C1 and U\u22061 equal to\nzero then a0 = 0 (see (9)) therefore we have no time-averaged flow and we get a simplified relation between stress and\nstrain-rate in Fourier space as\n\u03c4\u0303 1 =\n\n1 + iDe2  \u0303\n\u03b3\u0307 .\n1 + iDe1 1\n\n(15)\n\nSecond-order solution\n\nThe second-order component of (3) is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1 + De1\n\u03c4 2 \u2212 1 + De2\n\u03b3\u0307 2 = De1 \u2207uT\n1 * \u03c4 1 + \u03c4 1 * \u2207u1 \u2212 u1 * \u2207\u03c4\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 De2 \u2207uT\n1 * \u03b3\u0307 1 + \u03b3\u0307 1 * \u2207u1 \u2212 u1 * \u2207\u03b3\u0307 1 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe only part of the streamfunction, \u03c82 , that will contribute to the force on the sheets at second order is its mean\nvalue in x.

Using integration by parts, it is\nstraightforward to get that the force on the bottom sheet, to O(\u01eb2 ), is given by\nZ 2\u03c0\nf2x =\nh\u03c42xy i|y=0 dx,\n(27)\n0\n\nand only the mean component of the second-order stress, h\u03c42xy i, contributes to the net force. A similar relationship\nholds for the force on the upper sheet. We then proceed by obtaining h\u03c42xy i from (17), where h\u03b3\u0307 2 i = \u2207hu2 i + \u2207hu2 iT\nand hu2 i = [\u2202h\u03c82 i/\u2202y, \u2212\u2202h\u03c82 i/\u2202x]T . Exploiting that f |y=y1 = \u2212f |y=y2 we obtain C2 = 0, and the net force on the\nupper sheet is finally given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nDe1 \u2212 De2\n2\u03c0U\u22062\nh cosh h + sinh h\n+ 4\u03c0\n*\n(28)\nf2x = \u2212\nA(h) sin \u03c6, A(h) =\nh\ncosh(2h) \u2212 2h2 \u2212 1\n1 + De21\nRESULTS\nSynchronization\n\nIt is insightful to first consider the nature of the force which arises if the sheets are not permitted to move relative to\neach other but instead held with a fixed phase difference. If U\u22062 = 0, then the force in (28) is zero for \u03c6 = 0, \u00b1\u03c0. The\nfunction A(h), governing the variation in the force amplitude with mean distance h, is positive definite and decays\nexponentially with h, while becoming unbounded near h = 0 (see Fig. 2a). Since De1 > De2 , we see that the force\nf2x \u221d sin \u03c6. This indicates that \u03c6 = 0 is a stable fixed point while \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03c0 are unstable, and therefore we expect\nin-phase synchronization to occur.\nWe next observe that we obtain here a nonzero force on sheets with front/back symmetric waveforms[24]. In\nthe case of a Newtonian fluid, this is forbidden because of kinematic reversibility, and the force is identically zero\nunless the front/back symmetry is broken [10]. Indeed, in a Newtonian fluid, for any system with both vertical and\nhorizontal symmetry one can reflect about both axes of symmetry then reverse the kinematics to obtain an identical\nconformation with the opposite force necessitating fx = 0 (our calculations confirm this by setting De1 = De2 = 0 in\n28). In a viscoelastic fluid, time is no longer merely a parameter, and therefore the flow is no longer kinematically\nreversible, thereby permitting a nonzero force.\nIf instead of holding the sheets fixed, we let them move, we then have to enforce the force-free condition, and thus\ns\ns\nis the static force incurred when U\u22062 = 0 in (28). The\nwe obtain the relative speed U\u22062 = hf2x\n/2\u03c0, where f2x\nremarkable result is that, since the force occurs in a viscoelastic fluid at second order in the wave amplitude, the\nphase will evolve on a time scale varying as t \u223c \u01eb\u22122 . In a Newtonian fluid, it can be shown that the force is always\nzero to second order in \u01eb, for any shape, and first appears at fourth order for shapes with broken front-back symmetry\n[10]. This means that in a Newtonian fluid, at best, the phase will evolve to a phase-locked configuration on a time\nscale varying as t \u223c \u01eb\u22124 . In complex fluids, synchronization is therefore seen to take place on asymptotically faster\ntime scales than in a Newtonian fluid.\nWe now solve analytically for the time-evolution of the phase. Since to leading order \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212\u01eb2 U\u22062 , we obtain a\ndifferential equation for the evolution for \u03c6 as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03c6\nDe1 \u2212 De2\n2\nA(h) sin \u03c6,\n(29)\n= \u2212\u01eb 2h\ndt\n1 + De21\nwhich, for constant h, can be integrated to yield an analytical formula for the phase as\n\u001a\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\u001b\n\u03c60\nDe1 \u2212 De2\n\u03c6(t) = 2 tan\u22121 tan\nexp \u2212\u01eb2 2hA(h)\nt *\n2\n1 + De21\n\n(30)\n\n\f6\n\n1000\n\n3\u03a0\n4\n\u03a0\n2\n\n100\n\n\u03a0\n4\n\n10\n\n\u03c6 0\n\nA\n\n!\n\n\u03a0\n4\n\n!\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n1\n0.1\n\n!\n0\n\na)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n3\u03a0\n4\n\n10\n\nb)\n\nh\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n104\n\n105\n\nt\n\nFIG. 2: a) Amplitude A of the phase-locking force decays exponentially with the separation distance, h (28). b) Time-evolution\nof the phase angle \u03c6(t) from various initial conditions towards the stable in-phase conformation ((30) with \u01eb = 0.1, h = 2,\nDe1 = 100 and De2 = 10).\n\nGiven that De1 > De2 , we see that \u03c6 \u223c \u00b1e\u2212t near the \u03c6 = 0 fixed point, meaning it is stable; however, near the\n\u03c6 = \u00b1\u03c0 fixed points, \u03c6 \u2213 \u03c0 \u223c \u2213et meaning they are unstable and hence the phase converges to \u03c6 = 0 for all initial\nconditions. The time-evolution of the phase from various initial positions, assuming a constant separation between\nthe sheets of h = 2, is plotted in Fig. 2b with De1 = 100, De2 = 10 and \u01eb = 0.1. All initial conformations evolve to\nstable in-phase synchrony. In the Newtonian case, the stability of the in-phase versus opposite-phase conformation is\npurely a matter of geometry, regardless of considerations of energy dissipation, and in fact two swimmers can evolve\nto a stable conformation which maximizes the energy dissipated [10]. In contrast, in a viscoelastic fluid we find that\nwith no asymmetry the system naturally evolves to an in-phase conformation which, as we show below, coincides with\nthe conformation of minimal viscous dissipation.\n\nEnergy dissipation\n\nThe energy dissipated in the fluid between two sheets is given by integrating the dissipation density, \u03c4 : \u03b3\u0307, over the\nvolume. The leading order component is given by\n\u0002 \u0003 1 + De1 De2\n1 De1 \u2212 De2 \u0002  \u0303  \u0303 \u0003\n \u03031 =\n\u03c4 1 : \u03b3\u0307 1 = R [\u03c4\u0303 1 ] : R \u03b3\u0307\nI \u03b3\u0307 1 : \u03b3\u0307 1 ,\n2 \u03b3\u0307 1 : \u03b3\u0307 1 \u2212 2\n1 + De1\n1 + De21\n\n(31)\n\nwhere I[...] denotes the imaginary part. The second term in (31) integrates to zero over a period, thus, to leading\norder, the energy dissipation rate per unit depth over one period is given by\nZ\nZ\n1 + De1 De2 2\u03c0 y2\n\u03b3\u0307 1 : \u03b3\u0307 1 dxdy.\n(32)\n\u0116 = \u01eb2\n1 + De21\ny1\n0\nThe result of (32) is merely a scalar multiple of the Newtonian dissipation calculated by [7], which is minimum at the\nin-phase conformation, and maximum in the case of opposite-phase (and decays to zero as h \u2192 0). We see therefore\nthat in a viscoelastic fluid the system is driven towards a state of minimum energy dissipation.\nVertical force\n\nSince the evolution of the phase depends on the separation distance h, it is informative to analyze the magnitude\nof vertical forces between the sheets. We now proceed to compute the vertical force from the inner problem with\nthe first and second-order streamfunctions derived here, and we use the solutions of the outer flow problem from the\nliterature [18].

Both functions become unbounded as h \u2192 0, and both tend\nasymptotically to zero as h \u2192 \u221e. In Fig. 3a we plot the vertical force as a function of the distance between the\nsheets, h, for various \u03c6 (arbitrary units). If the phase difference is above \u03c0/2 (\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 is shown dashed), then the\nsheets will be repelled from each other. However, as the sheets get closer in phase there arises a finite equilibrium\nseparation, heq (\u03c6), where f2y = 0. If the sheets are separated by h < heq , they will be repelled while if h > heq , they\nwill be attracted. In Fig. 3b we plot heq as a function of phase difference and we see that the equilibrium separation\ndecreases monotonically with decreasing \u03c6 and that when the sheets are in phase the vertical force acting on them is\nstrictly attractive. Indeed, for \u03c6 = 0, in the limit h \u2192 0 we see that f2y = (3\u03c0/4)(De1 \u2212 De2 )/(1 + De21 )[25].\nCoupled dynamics\n\nIn the idealized two-dimensional case studied here, the swimmer mobility in the vertical direction is strictly zero\nand hence only motion in the horizontal direction occurs. In the slender-body limit, which is the one relevant for the\ndynamics of three-dimensional flagellar filaments of swimming cells, the viscous mobility in the direction perpendicular\nto the length of the flagellum is about half of that in the parallel direction [23]. In order to propose a simple model\nfor the coupled vertical/horizontal motion of the sheets, we proceed to use this ratio in our model, and simply assume\n\u01eb2 h s\ndh\n=\u2212\nf .\ndt\n4\u03c0 2y\n\n(37)\n\nGiven the behavior of the vertical force, we expect the swimmers to be pushed apart slightly if their phase difference\nis large, then, as the phase difference decreases, to be attracted to a final synchronized conformation where the flagella\nare as close together as possible, as seen experimentally [6].

The initial\ncondition is h0 = 2, and the mobility in y is taken to be half of that in x: \u03c60 = 3\u03c0/4 (dotted line), \u03c60 = \u03c0/2 (dashed line),\n\u03c60 = \u03c0/8 (solid line). With \u01eb = 0.1, De1 = 100 and De2 = 10.\n\n(29) and (37), to obtain the coupled time evolution of h(t), shown in Fig. 4a, and \u03c6(t), shown in Fig. 4b, for an initial\nseparation h0 = 2. We see that for a small enough initial angle, the sheets are monotonically attracted to each-other\n(\u03c60 = \u03c0/8, solid line). However, for larger initial phase differences, the sheets are initially repelled, before reaching\na maximum separation, and eventually being drawn together closely. This is illustrated for \u03c60 = \u03c0/2 (dashed line)\nand \u03c60 = 3\u03c0/4 (dotted line). The time scale for the evolution of the phase angle is similar to the constant separation\ncase, and all initial conformations converge to the stable in-phase conformation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we used a two-dimensional model to analytically address the synchronization of two swimmers in a\nviscoelastic (Oldroyd-B) fluid. In Newtonian fluids, a front-back asymmetry in the swimmer's waveform is required\nfor synchronization. In contrast, in a viscoelastic fluid, phase-locking occurs even for swimmers displaying front/back\nsymmetry. The two swimmers are driven into a stable in-phase conformation where a minimum of mechanical energy\nis dissipated, contrary to the Newtonian case where the stable conformation can be either in-phase or opposite-phase\ndepending only on the waveform geometry. In addition, the evolution to a phase-locked conformation in a viscoelastic\nfluid occurs on asymptotically faster time scales than in a Newtonian fluid.\nFrom a biological standpoint, the results of our model indicate that, for example, mammalian spermatozoa progressing through cervical mucus would be expected to synchronize passively, thereby reducing the work they are doing\nagainst the surrounding fluid as compared to when swimming isolated. This net energy savings could then potentially\nbe used to increase their wave speeds, and hence swimming speed, as is observed experimentally [6]. The asymptotically larger forces between swimmers might also lead to large-scale coherence in the dynamics of cell suspensions\nwhich is more pronounced in complex fluids than in Newtonian environments.\nFunding by the NSF (CBET-0746285) and NSERC (PGS D3-374202) is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nElectronic address: elauga@ucsd.edu\nE.
