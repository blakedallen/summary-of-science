Accordingly, observation of the ac Josephson effect\nin FQHS clarifies the structure of the fractional quantum Hall states.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) have been observed at fractional filling factors \u03bd (=2/3, 3/5, 2/5 * * *) in high mobility semiconductor\nheterojunctions. The confinements of the Hall resistance are extremely precise as clarified in experimental data. The FQHE phenomena are caused by\nCoulomb interactions among many electrons. Many physicists had interests\nto examine the origin of FQHE.\nR. B. Laughlin proposed an explicit trial wave function (Laughlin wave\nfunction). He argued that the elementary excitations are quasiparticles with\nfractional electric charge 1 , and then explained the fractional quantum Hall\neffect. F. D. M. Haldane 2 and B. I. Halperin 3 extended the scheme of\nLaughlin. The quasiparticles and quasiholes have fractional charge and obey\n\n\fEnergy\n\nClassical Coulomb energy\nbinding energy via\nquantum transition\n\ngap EG\n3/2\n\n1/\u03bd\n\nFig. 1. Energy spectrum of electron pair theory for FQH states near \u03bd = 2/3.\nfractional statistics 4 .\nA model of composite fermions has been introduced by J. K. Jain 5 and\nhas been developed by many physicists 6 , 7 . The composite fermion consists\nof an electron (or hole) which is bound to an even number of magnetic flux\nquanta. Accordingly the composite fermions have integer charge, just like\nelectrons.\nRecently, the perturbation energies via Coulomb transitions between\nmany electrons are calculated for the FQH state with the minimum classical\nCoulomb energy 8 , 9 , 10 . In the result, the electron pair has a binding energy\nfor specific filling factors. The typical energy spectrum has energy gaps at\nthe specific filling factors as shown in Fig.1. We call the theory electron pair\ntheory of FQHE hereafter.\nThis energy spectrum explains the precise confinement for plateau heights\nof Hall resistance at the specific filling factors 10 . The mechanism is caused by\nthe binding energies of electron pairs. These three types of theories have different wave functions. Accordingly the electric charge value of quasi-particle\nis different from each other in the three theories. At the filling factor \u03bd, the\nelectric charge value Q is\nQ = \u03bde\n\nfor Laughlin theory,\n\n(1)\n\nQ=e\n\nfor composite fermion theory,\n\n(2)\n\nQ = 2e\n\nfor electron pair theory of FQHE,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the value e expresses the elementary charge of electron. If we detect\nthe charge value Q through a Josephson junction in a quantum Hall device,\nthen the mechanism of FQHE is more clarified. In this article, we propose\n\n\fz\n\nHall\nprobe\n\ny\nx\n\nSource\n\nPotential\nprobes\n\nDrain\n\nGate\n\nThis area is enlarged as follows:\nSource\n\nJosephson junction\n\nDrain\n\nSide View\n\nFig. 2.

Different type of quantum Hall device with central gate\nan experiment detecting the transfer charge via a Josephson junction in a\nquantum Hall device.\n\n2.\n\nac Josephson effect in quantum Hall device\n\nWe consider the following experiment, namely measurement of ac Josephson effect in quantum Hall device. The device is schematically drawn in\nFig.2. The central part of electron channel has a thickness less than in the\nother part as illustrated in the side view of Fig.2, where the 2D electron\nsystem is connected through this thin part from left to right. This type of\nJosephson junction is familiar in superconducting phenomena. When the\ncurrent value exceeds the critical value of the central thin part, this thin\npart plays a role of Josephson junction. This type of Josephson junction is\nrelatively-easy-to-make compared with original type of Josephson junction.\nWe can consider another type of device as illustrated in Fig.3. We can\nmake small potential barrier, when the voltage of the central gate in Fig.3 is\nappropriately chosen. The small potential barrier plays a role of Josephson\njunction.\n\n\feV/( hf)\n\neV/( hf)\n\ncurrent (arbitrary unit)\n(Case A) Laughlin wave function\n\ncurrent (arbitrary unit)\n(Case B) Composite fermion\n\neV/( hf)\n\ncurrent (arbitrary unit)\n(Case C) Electron pair theory\n\nFig. 4. Diagonal voltage between potential probes in a quantum Hall device at the filling factor \u03bd = 2/3 under the magnetic modulation with the\noscillation frequency f .\n\n3.\n\nVoltage Step depending on Quasi Charge\n\nThe magnetic field is applied in the direction vertical to the 2D electron\nsystem. The strength of the magnetic field is adjusted to make an FQH state.\nNext, an oscillating magnetic field with the frequency value f is added to the\ndevice. (We can use an oscillating current modulation on constant current\ninstead of an oscillating magnetic field.) Thereafter we detect the voltage\nbetween two potential probes, while the electric current value between the\nsource and the drain is changed from small to large. The voltage versus\nelectric current value might have many steps. The predicted behaviors are\nschematically drawn in Fig.4. The value eV /(hf ) of the first step is equal to\neV /(hf ) = e/Q\n\n(4)\n\nwhere V is the voltage value between two potential probes, h is the constant\nof Planck. The value is 1.5 for Laughlin theory, 1 for composite fermion\ntheory and 0.5 for electron pair theory at the filling factor \u03bd = 2/3. Consequently this detection of voltage versus current is an interesting experiment.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1. Laughlin R B 1983 Phys. Rev. B 27 3383; ibid 1983 Phys. Rev. Lett. 50 1395.\n2.
