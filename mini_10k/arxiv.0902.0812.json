Warburg in 1881. Warburg found that iron got\nheated up when placed in a magnetic field and when the magnetic field was removed the iron sample cooled\ndown (Warburg 1881). The basic principle of the MCE is that the ordering of the magnetic moments is\nincreased when an external magnetic field is applied to a magnetic material. This means that the spin-entropy\ndecreases. The process is virtually adiabatic if the field is applied rapidly. This means that the total entropy\nof the system must remain constant and thus the lattice and electron entropies must increase, which is\nequivalent to an increase in temperature. The process is reversible (for some materials) and thus the opposite\nwill take place when the field is removed again (i.e. the ordering of the magnetic moments decrease and the\ntemperature thus decreases). The MCE is strongest at the phase-transition between the ferromagnetic and the\nparamagnetic phases. This phase transition takes place at the Curie temperature TC , which can vary\nsignificantly depending on the material. In the past materials have been used mainly for cryogenic\napplications, but some 30 years ago research into the MCE at room temperature was commenced (Brown\n1976) .\nThe MCE yields, for the benchmark magnetocaloric material (MCM) gadolinium (Gd), an adiabatic\ntemperature change of about 3.6 K at room temperature for a 1 tesla (T) magnetic flux density. This rather\nlow temperature change is obviously too small for direct usage in a cooling device. However, if the material\nis used in an AMR it is possible to achieve, due to regeneration, a higher temperature difference (Brown\n1976). In his experiments Brown reached a temperature span of 46 K using Gd with the hot end at 319 K\nusing a 7 T magnetic flux density from a super conducting magnet. The MCE of Gd is proportional to the\nmagnetic flux density to the power of 0.7 (Pecharsky and Gschneidner 2006). Today's state-of-the-art\npermanent magnets yield a magnetic flux density of about 1.5 T (Tura and Rowe 2007). Therefore it is\ncrucial to develop a high-performing and efficient AMR.\nThis work is primarily concerned with developing a model describing an existing AMR test machine based\non parallel plates, and using a permanent magnet based on the Halbach design yielding around 1.1 T\n(Halbach 1980) . In Section 2 the experimental test machine is described. In Section 3 the corresponding\nnumerical model is presented. In Section 4 results from the test machine and the model are compared both\nincluding no-load and load-situations. In Section 5 the results are discussed and the work is concluded with\nsome future aspects briefly discussed.\n\n8th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, Copenhagen, 2008\n\n\f2.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nFigure 1 shows photos of the test machine, which consists of a regenerator core in the middle of a plastic\ntube with outer diameter 40 mm and inner diameter 34 mm. The regenerator core is built up of 13 plates of\n99.9 % pure Gd (obtained from China Rare Metal Materials Co). The plates with dimensions 40x0.9x25 mm\nhave a total mass of 92 g. At both ends of the Gd plates (in the flow direction) 20 mm long plastic flow\nguides are placed to ensure a fully developed laminar flow across the plates. The plates and flow guides are\nfixed by precision machined grooves and are stacked with a spacing of 0.8 mm, which is then the height of\nthe fluid channel.\n(b)\n(a)\n\nFigure 1: Figure (a) shows a close-up of the experimental AMR test machine where the 13 parallel channels can be seen as well as\nthe plastic tube. Figure (b) is a picture of the machine in its operational environment. The permanent Halbach magnet can be seen\nwith the plastic tube including the regenerator core penetrating it.\n\nThe heat transfer fluid is moved by a piston. The regenerator block and its parent plastic tube are suspended\nvertically in a mounting as shown in Figure 1b and can be moved in and out of the field of the permanent\nHalbach magnet using stepper motors. This magnet has a maximum magnetic flux density of 1.1 T.\nOne of the most important results of the experiment \u2013 as well as in the model \u2013 is to be able to measure the\ntemperature gradient across the regenerator core. This is done via five type E thermo-couples placed\nequidistantly in the center flow channel as sketched in Figure 2a.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: Drawing (a) is a schematic of the regenerator pictured in Figure 1a. The locations of the five thermo-couples are indicated\nwith their appropriate numbers. Thermo-couples 1and 5 are placed at the cold and hot ends respectively. Figure (b) shows how the\nnumerical model represents the full geometry of the AMR. The model breaks the geometry down into a single replicating cell\nconsisting of one half of a complete flow channel (indicated with a dashed line in the figure and magnified in Figure 3).\n\nThe system evolves transiently through a number of AMR cycles until cyclic steady-state has been reached.\nEach cycle consists of four different steps, which have four different characteristic times \u03c41 , \u03c42 , \u03c43 and \u03c44 .\nThe cycle is symmetric meaning that \u03c41 = \u03c43 and \u03c42 = \u03c44 . In the first step the magnetic field is applied thus\nincreasing the temperature of the MCM and at this stage the fluid is stationary. In the second step, the pistons\nmove the fluid for \u03c42 seconds towards the hot end of the regenerator to reject heat. At the third step the\nmagnetic field is switched off and thus the temperature in the MCM decreases and again at this stage the\nfluid is stationary. Finally, the piston pushes the fluid towards the cold end for \u03c44 seconds. The total cycletime is \u03c4total = 2(\u03c41 + \u03c42 ). In this way the MCM is used as the active material in a regenerator and a\n8th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, Copenhagen, 2008\n\n\ftemperature gradient is built up. The magnitude of this gradient depends mainly on the geometry, material\nand operational properties, i.e. the piston stroke length, \u03c41 and \u03c42 , the height of the fluid channel, the MCM,\nand how strong the magnetic field is. It is therefore quite a challenge to predict the behavior of a certain\nsystem for different process parameters.\n\nFigure 3: A close-up of the line of symmetry from the replicating cell marked with a dashed line in Figure 2b.\n\nThe geometrical simplicity of such an experimental setup makes it ideal for studies of parallel plate\nregenerators, facilitating direct comparison to the numerical model. Validating the model against the\nexperiment is crucial since a high-quality model can predict the performance of configurations otherwise not\nthought of and span a much larger parameter-space than possible with the experiment.\n\n3.\n\nNUMERICAL MODELING\n\n3.1 Thermal model of the regenerator\nThe numerical model is \"2.5-dimensional\" as illustrated geometrically in Figure 4 and Figure 5. For\ntechnical reasons the heat transfer fluid is chosen to be stationary and the solid domains are moved relative to\nthis. Thus, the piston movement is modeled as a coordinate transformation of the solid domains with a\nsuitable convective term in the thermal equation for the fluid. The spatial discretization is the classical 2nd\norder finite difference scheme with a equidistant grid where \u0394x = 1 mm and \u0394y = 0.05 mm, and the\ntemporal integration is done using an Alternate Direction Implicit (ADI) solver with a timestep chosen to be\n0.001 second. Since the system includes moving boundaries it is extremely important to make sure that there\nis energy conservation. Therefore the finite difference (FD) formulation is preferred and validation-tests\nshow that the energy-conservation is virtually the precision of the computer. The computational time on a 2.0\nGHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU is roughly 0.7 CPU-seconds pr physical second in the model.\nDue to symmetry considerations only half a replicating cell is modeled (as indicated in Figure 3). This is a\ngood assumption at least for the central channels and plates (which have virtually no loss through the top and\nbottom of the regenerator).\nFigure 4a and Figure 5 show a schematic of the boundary conditions of the model in the (x,y)-plane and\n(x,z)-plane respectively. The various thermal resistances are labeled with their respective names.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4 : Figure (a) shows a schematic of the modeled domain in the (x,y)-plane, i.e. half a replicating cell with the boundaries\nbeing either adiabatic (symmetry boundaries) or coupled via thermal resistances to the ambient. The x-direction is the direction of\nthe flow and the y-direction is orthogonal to the plates (labeled MCM). The left end is defined as the cold end and the right end as\nthe hot end. Figure (b) shows a 3D sketch of the regenerator block with the coordinate system visualized.\n\nThe governing equations for the thermal system are\n\u2202Tfl\nkfl\n=\n\u22072 Tfl \u2212 u \u22c5 \u2207 Tfl\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u03c1fl cp,fl\n\u2202Ts\nks\n=\n\u22072 Ts\n(2)\n\u2202t\n\u03c1s cp,s\nwhere the temperatures of the fluid and solid domains are denoted by Tfl and Ts respectively. For simplicity\nall the solid domains are labeled with an s, although they have different physical properties. The thermal\nproperties, i.e. the thermal conductivities kfl and ks , the mass densities \u03c1fl and \u03c1s and the heat capacities\ncp,fl and cp,s are all assumed constant except the heat capacity of Gd, which varies as function of both\ntemperature and magnetic field (see Figure 6). The material properties used are given in Table 1.\n8th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, Copenhagen, 2008\n\n\fFigure 5 : The model in the (x, z)-plane. The z-direction is only resolved by one grid cell meaning that the model is effectively 2.5dimensional with the x- and y-dimensions being the two regular dimensions and the finite extension of the z-direction as the half\ndimension (and most importantly including losses via boundary conditions).\n\nThe velocity field in the fluid is denoted by u = (u, v) and is prescribed by the analytical expression for a\nparallel-plate laminar flow with piston velocity up , see e.g. (T. F. Petersen 2007):\nHfl2 \u2202p\ny2\n(3)\nu=\n1 \u2212 2 + up\n2\u03bc \u2202x\nHfl\n(4)\nv=0\n2\nup\n\u2202p 96\n1\n(5)\n=\n\u03c1fl\n\u2202x Re\n4Hfl 2\nThe Reynolds' number Re = up 4Hfl \u03c1fl /\u03bc, \u03c1fl is the mass density of the fluid, Hfl is half the height of the\nfluid channel, \u03bc is the viscosity of the fluid and y is the vertical coordinate, i.e. orthogonal to the flow\ndirection.\n\n.\nFigure 6 : Left: cp for Gd as function of temperature in zero field (solid line) and in a 1 T field (dashed line). The change around\n293 K is rather significant and is actually the definition of the Curie temperature. Right: The adiabatic temperature change of Gd\naround room-temperature in a 1 T field. The red/solid line is the temperature increase when the field is applied and the blue/dashed\nline is the corresponding curve for when the field is removed. The data are calculated from the mean field model of Gd compiled in\ne.g. (Petersen, et al. 2008).\n\nThe internal boundaries between the fluid domain and the solid domains are implemented through thermal\nresistances in Fourier's law of thermal conduction:\nT1 \u2212 T2\nqbd = \u2212\n.\n(6)\nR1 + R2\nHere the flux across the boundary between two domains (e.g. fluid and MCM) is denoted by qbd , the\ntemperature of the boundary cells in the two adjacent domains are T1 and T2 and their corresponding thermal\nresistances are R1 and R2 respectively. The thermal resistance is simply given by the distance from the grid\ncell's centre to the boundary face divided by the thermal conductivity of the material multiplied by the area\nof the face boundary.\n\n8th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, Copenhagen, 2008\n\n\fTable 1 : Material properties used in the model obtained from (Petersen, et al. 2008) and (Holman 1987).\n\nMaterial\nWater/ethanol mixture\nPlastic\nGd\n\nk W m\u22c5K\n0.52\n0.2\n10.5\n\n\u03c1 [kg m3 ]\n981\n1200\n7900\n\ncp [J kg \u22c5 K]\n4330\n840\n170-300\n\n\u03bc [kg m \u22c5 s]\n8.91 \u22c5 10\u22124\nn/a\nn/a\n\nThe outer boundaries are either adiabatic, if they are symmetry boundaries, or they simulate heat loss in the\nz-direction, which is not directly resolved (hence this is what we call a 2.5-dimensional model). These losses\nare calculated via thermal resistances and they contain the thicknesses and thermal conductivities of the\nparticular domain (fluid or solid) and the insulating material surrounding the entire system. On the outer part\nof the insulating material there is assumed to be natural convection modeled via the parameter hconv , which\nhas a value in the range 5 \u2212 20 W/Km2 and corresponds to free convection of air on a plate (Holman 1987).\n3.2 The permanent magnet\nThe magnetic field that generates the MCE can be produced by an\nelectromagnet or a permanent magnet assembly. For this machine we have\nchosen the latter as this requires no external power source to produce a\nstrong magnetic field. The requirement of the permanent magnet assembly\nis that it must produce a strong homogenous magnetic field in a confined\nregion of space and a very weak field elsewhere. The design known as a\nHalbach cylinder (Mallinson 1973), (Halbach 1980) fulfills these\nrequirements and has therefore been chosen for the test machine. An ideal\nHalbach cylinder consists of a permanent magnetic material with a bore\nalong the cylinder symmetry axis. The magnetic material is magnetized\nsuch that the direction of magnetization varies as shown in Figure 7. This\nproduces a strong homogeneous field in the cylinder bore. In the case of\nFigure 7: A drawing of a Halbach\nan infinitely long cylinder the flux density in the bore is given by B = cylinder showing the internal radius,\nr\nBr ln ex .

First a sensitivity analysis of how far the\nregenerator is taken out of the Halbach's magnetic field is addressed under no-load conditions. Secondly a\nload-situation is investigated.\n4.1 Sensitivity to the magnetic field\nSince the magnetic field of the Hallbach magnet strays outside of the central bore in the cylinder (see Figure\n8), the distance which the regenerator block is moved away from the centre of the Halbach must have some\ninfluence on the performance of the regenerator. The experiments were adjusted to move the regenerator out\nof the magnetic field with a distance varying from 30 mm to 150 mm (see Figure 9). The operating\nconditions were the same for each experiment, which was allowed to reach steady-state in each case (see\nTable 2). The model was set with the same parameters and the varying magnetic field was implemented via a\nvolumetric source term in the heat equation for the MCM:\ndQMCM\n\u2202\u03c3 dB\n= \u2212\u03c1Gd TGd\n.\n(7)\ndt\n\u2202T dt\nThis is obtained from the mean field theory of Gd,\nsee e.g. (Petersen, et al. 2008). The change with\nrespect to temperature of the magnetization is\ndenoted by \u2202\u03c3 \u2202T and the magnetic flux density is\ndenoted by B. The magnetic field only varies in the\nx-direction in the regenerator. The crucial term in this\nformulation is the time variation of the magnetic\nfield. This is implemented simply using the finite\nextent of the regenerator block and the velocity of\nwhich the regenerator is moved in and out of field.\nAs seen in Figure 9 there is one series of\nexperimental data and two model series. The data sets\nshow the no-load steady-state temperature span\nbetween thermo-couples one and five as function of\nhow far the regenerator is taken out of the magnetic\nfield. It is seen from the experimental data that at\ndistances above 70 mm the temperature span does not\nincrease anymore; hence, the full yield of the magnet\nis utilized.\nFigure 9: The figure shows how the steady-state and no-load\nThe model simulations were done for two cases: One temperature span behaves when the regenerator is not taken\nwith no loss to the surroundings, i.e. perfect thermal completely out of the magnetic field (the red/dotted line). Each\ninsulation, and one with realistic losses via the asterisk in the graph represents a data point. Also included are the\nboundary conditions described in Section 3.1. The results of two slightly different numerical simulations; one without\nlosses (the black/solid line) and one with ideal losses (blue/dashed\ntendencies of all three data sets are virtually the line). The tendencies are clearly the same on all three graphs. The\nsame, which clearly shows that the numerical model absolute values of the temperature spans differ somewhat, however,\ncatches many of the aspects of the magnetic including losses is seen to improve the correspondence between\nregeneration. It is not surprising that the ideal experiment and model significantly.\nadiabatic model overestimates the temperature span somewhat as significant losses to the ambient are\nexpected in the test device. When the losses are included, however, the model comes much closer at the\nexperimental values still showing the exact same tendency.\nTable 2 : The operational properties of the two experiment series.\n\nEffective piston stroke length (% of plate length)\n\n\u03c41 (s)\n\n\u03c42 (s)\n\nMagnetic field variation\n\n40 %\n\n3.0\n\n2.9\n\nHeat load experiment\n\n53 %\n\n1.5\n\n2.9\n\nExperiment\n\n4.2 Load experiment\nThe piston at the cold end has been equipped with a copper plate connected to a power supply which makes\nit possible to apply a heat load through ohmic dissipation to the water.

The model was set with the same parameters\nand a spatially constant magnetic flux density of 1 T. Figure 10 shows both an example of the transient\nevolution of a specific heat load experiment (left-hand) and the results of the heat-load series (right-hand).\n\nFigure 10: Left: The transient evolution of the cold, middle and hot parts of the regenerator (simulated). The particular example is\nfor a piston stroke (\u0394x) of 53% with a load of 0.8 W. Right: A load-experiment and the corresponding model results. The model\nassumed hconv = 20 W m2 K. Note that there are two model-series in the right graph. The green/solid line data set was performed\nwith a constant ambient temperature whereas the blue/dashed line data set corresponds directly to the circumstances during the\nexperimental data acquisition (black line/dotted).\n\nThe experimental series was performed over a period of two days since it takes around an hour to reach\nsteady-state for each configuration. Therefore the ambient temperature T\u221e varied slightly (from 296-299 K).\nThis is possible to adjust in the model as well, and therefore the two data sets are directly comparable. The\nmodel and the experimental data are very similar in behavior, though the model over-estimates the\ntemperature span. Generally the temperature span decreases linearly with the increasing cooling capacity as\none would expect. There are, however, minor fluctuations in the linearity. If the experimental data are\nconsidered isolated, the small variations may be regarded as experimental noise. However, when compared\nto the model data, virtually the same variations are seen. To investigate this, a model-series was performed\nwith the ambient temperature set to the constant value 298 K. This is seen as the green/solid line in the right\ngraph of Figure 10. Thus, the variations away from the linearly decreasing cooling capacity are interpreted as\na result of the fluctuations in the ambient temperature. The slopes of each of the three graphs were found by\nlinear regression. The values are all -0.2 \u00b10.01 W/K.\n\n5.\n\nDISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\n5.1 Discussion\nThe numerical model has been successfully validated against real experiments in different situations\nincluding no-load and load-experiments, varying the magnetic field and some of the operational parameters,\nnamely piston stroke length, \u03c41 and \u03c42 . The discrepancies between the model and the experiment seen in\nFigure 9 and Figure 10 are, however, something that should be considered and the model should be improved\nto minimize these. We have used an ideal model for the behavior of Gd in terms of cp and \u0394Tad . We have\nindependently measured the actual adiabatic temperature change of the Gd used in the test machine and it has\nturned out that due to impurities the actual adiabatic temperature change is roughly 20 % lower than in the\nideal mean field model used in the numerical model. We have chosen not to include this in the present work\nsince we have not yet performed enough measurements of the utilized Gd in order to cover the range in\nmagnetic fields and temperature span needed.\nA result of this work is that the model is directly capable of catching the effect of the ambient temperature on\nthe system. This may have been interpreted as an experimental feature (e.g. noise) if the model had not\ncaught it and if not the constant-ambient temperature modeling had resulted in the completely straight line\nseen in the right part of Figure 10.\n8th IIR Gustav Lorentzen Conference on Natural Working Fluids, Copenhagen, 2008\n\n\f5.2 Conclusions and outlook\nThe experimental AMR at Ris\u00f8 DTU has been demonstrated to be quite versatile in terms of operational\nparameters and various aspects of the cooling capacity. The corresponding numerical model is to a large\nextent successful in predicting the behavior of the system. Many interesting aspects still need to be\ninvestigated though. They include obtaining more reliable and realistic data of the Gd we actually use in our\ntest machine, testing other potential MCM materials and changing the thickness of the plates and the fluid\nchannels as well as the operating parameters. Having a powerful numerical model that predicts the behavior\nseen experimentally is crucial for the further development of a new AMR with significantly improved\nperformance. The fact that there is a very strong correspondence between the experimental and modeling\nresults in both series presented in Section 4 strongly indicates that the model indeed captures the general\nbehavior of the parallel-plate AMR system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank Mr. J\u00f8rgen Geyti for his technical assistance.
