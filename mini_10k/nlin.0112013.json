The initial magnetic fields of galaxies\nand stars are weak, and are amplified by the turbulent motion of the plasma. The generated field gets\nsaturated due to nonlinear interactions. The above process is called \"dynamo\" action. Qualitatively,\nthe magnetic field is amplified by the stretching of the field lines due to turbulent plasma motion. A\nfraction of kinetic energy of the plasma is spent in increasing the tension of the magnetic field lines,\nwhich effectively enhances the magnetic field strength. Current dynamo theories of are of two types,\nkinematic and dynamic. In the kinematic theories, one studies the evolution of magnetic field under a\nprescribed velocity field. In kinematic \u03b1-dynamo, the averaged nonlinear term hu \u00d7 bi (u, b are velocity\nand magnetic field fluctuations respectively) is replaced by a constant \u03b1 times mean magnetic field\nB0 . This process, which is valid for small magnetic field fluctuations, yields linear equations that can\nbe solved for a given boundary condition and external forcing fields1\u22123 . In dynamic theories4\u22126 , the\nmodification of velocity field by the magnetic field (back reaction) is taken into account. Using a\ndifferent approach, here we compute energy transfer rates from velocity field to magnetic field using\nfield-theoretic method. The striking result of our field theoretic calculation is that there is a large\nenergy transfer rate from the large-scale velocity field to the large-scale magnetic field. We claim that\nthe growth of large-scale magnetic energy is primarily due to this transfer. We reached the above\nconclusion without any linear approximation like that in \u03b1-dynamo.\nThere is an exchange of energy between various Fourier modes because of nonlinear interactions present in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Since there are two vector fields u and b in MHD, the energy can be transferred from u to u,\nu to b, and b to b. Energy from a parent mode u(k) or b(k) (k represents the wavenumber of Fourier mode) is transferred to two daughter modes with wavenumbers p and k \u2212 p. The allowed triads in MHD are (u(k), u(p), u(k \u2212 p))\nand (u(k), b(p), b(k \u2212 p)). The net effects of all the energy transfers are constant energy fluxes from large-scale\nu<\nb<\nu to small-scale u (\u03a0u<\nu> ), large-scale u to small-scale b (\u03a0b> ), large-scale b to small-scale u (\u03a0u> ), large-scale b to\nb<\nu<\nsmall-scale b (\u03a0b> ), and large-scale u to large-scale b (\u03a0b< ). The superscript and subscript of \u03a0 refer to the source\nand sink respectively. All these energy fluxes are illustrated in Fig. 1. These energy fluxes are analogous to that of\nKolmogorov's flux in fluid turbulence. Note that large-scale velocity modes are forced, as shown in the figure.\nStanis\u0306i\u01077, Dar et al.8 , and others have given formulas for computation of the above fluxes. However, Dar et al.'s\nformalism is the most general, and they have numerically computed all the fluxes of MHD using numerical data of\ndirect numerical simulation8 . In the present paper, we compute the MHD fluxes in the inertial range using fieldtheoretic method. Our calculation is up to first order in perturbation.\nWe give a brief outline of the theoretical calculation ( refer to Verma9 for details). We write down the evolution\nequation for kinetic energy spectrum ( |u(k)|2 /2) and magnetic energy ( |B(k)|2 /2). We carry out our analysis\nfor three space dimensions, constant mass density, and zero mean magnetic field. We also assume that hu * bi = 0,\nand that the large-scale velocity modes are forced. There is a net outflow/inflow of energy from a wavenumber sphere\n(say sphere of radius k0 ) as discussed in the earlier paragraph. These energy fluxes can be easily calculated using the\nFourier modes. To illustrate, the energy flux from the modes inside of the u-sphere of radius k0 to the modes outside\nof the b-sphere of radius k0 is given by\nZ\nZ\ndk\ndp\nu<\n\u03a0b> (k0 ) =\nhI([k * u(q)][b(k) * u(p)])i\n(1)\n3\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n(2\u03c0)\nk\u2032 >k0\np<k0\nu>\nwhere I stands for the imaginary part, and k = p + q. Clearly the sources of energy for the b < sphere are \u03a0u<\nb< , \u03a0b< ,\nb>\nand \u03a0b< . If there is a net flux of energy into large-scale magnetic energy, then magnetic energy at large-scale will\ngrow, or dynamo is active.\nWe calculate the energy fluxes perturbatively to first order. We assume homogeneity and isotropy for the flow. In\nthe correlation functions we have included kinetic helicity (HK = hu * \u03c9i /2, where \u03c9 is the vorticity) and magnetic\nhelicity (HM = ha * bi /2, where a is the vector potential), which are defined using\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2HK (k)\n\u2032\nuu\n\u03b4(k + k\u2032 )\n(2)\nhui (k)uj (k )i = Pij (k)C (k) \u2212 i\u01ebijl kl\nk2\n\u0002\n\u0003\nhbi (k)bj (k\u2032 )i = Pij (k)C bb (k) \u2212 i\u01ebijl kl 2HM (k) \u03b4(k + k\u2032 )\n(3)\n\n1\n\n\fNote that helicities break mirror symmetry.\nWe focus on the fluxes in the inertial range. Based on recent theoretical10\u221214 and numerical15,16 evidences, we take\nKolmogorov's spectrum for the correlation functions in the inertial range, i.e.,\nK u 2/3 \u221211/3\n\u03a0 k\n;\n4\u03c0\nHK (k) = rK kC uu (k);\n\nC uu (k) =\n\nC bb (k) = C uu (k)/rA ;\n\n(4)\n\nHM (k) = rM C bb (k)/k\n\n(5)\n\nSince both magnetic and kinetic energy spectrum are Kolmogorov-like in the inertial range, rA , rK and rM can\nbe treated as constants. We also use turbulent or renormalized viscosity and resistivity in our calculation. These\nquantities have been recently derived by Verma13,17 . Using the steady-state condition, we also calculate the energy\nb<\nb<\nsupply from the large-scale velocity field to the large-scale magnetic field \u03a0u<\nb< = \u03a0b> + \u03a0u> . Since the inertial-range\nenergy spectrum is universal, the above energy flux is independent of the details of large-scale forcing.\nWe calculate various fluxes in terms of rA , rK , rM (see Verma9 for further details). In Fig. 1 we have shown\nboth nonhelical (solid line) and helical (dashed line) contributions for the case (rA = 5000, rK = 0.1, rM = \u22120.1).\nLarge rA (here rA = 5000) corresponds to a very weak magnetic field compared to the velocity field, similar to\nthe early phase of galactic and stellar evolution. The choice of rK = 0.1 and rM = \u22120.1 is motivated by the\nfact that both kinetic and magnetic helicities in most of the astrophysical plasmas are relatively small. The recent\nsimulations of Brandenburg18 as well as the EDQNM calculation of Pouquet et al.4 shows that the magnetic helicity\nis negative for small wavenumbers. Since the small wavenumber contributions dominate the contributions from the\nlarge wavenumbers, we have taken rM < 0.\nThe flux ratios shown in Fig. 1 illustrate many important results. They are:\n\u2022 There is a large energy flux from large-scale velocity field to large-scale magnetic field (\u03a0u<\nb< ). In addition, there\nu>\nare two other fluxes, \u03a0b>\n+\n\u03a0\n,\nto\nthe\nlarge-scale\nmagnetic\nfield.\nThese\nfluxes\nare responsible for the\nb<helical\nb<helical\ngrowth of large-scale magnetic field in the initial stage of evolution. Pouquet et al.4 , Pouquet and Patterson19,\nu<\nBrandenburg18, and many others generally highlight \u03a0b>\nb<helical inverse transfer, and do not consider \u03a0b< .\n18,20\nRecently Brandenburg\nargues that large-scale magnetic energy is sustained by nonlocal inverse cascade\nfrom the forcing scale directly to the largest scale of the box. He relates this effect to the \u03b1-effect. In this\npaper and Verma9 we have computed the relative magnitudes of all three contributions for generic parameters\ndiscussed above, and find that all of them to be comparable, however, \u03a0u<\nb< is somewhat higher.\n\u2022 As shown in the figure, the nonhelical component of magnetic energy flux (\u03a0b<\nb> ) is forward, while the helical\ncomponent of magnetic energy flux is negative (inverse). The overall magnetic energy flux however is positive.\nIn our theoretical calculation we have assumed homogeneity and isotropy of the flow, as well as B0 = 0. These\nassumptions are likely to hold in the early stages of the galactic evolution before large structures appear. To model\nthe early evolution of galaxies, we assume that the large-scales contains kinetic and magnetic energies. During this\nb>\nunsteady period, magnetic energy(E b ) will be amplified by the nonhelical \u03a0u<\nb< , and helical components \u03a0b<helical and\nu>\n\u03a0b<helical , i.e.,\ndE b (t)\nb>\nu>\n= \u03a0u<\nb< + \u03a0b<helical + \u03a0b<helical\ndt\n\n(6)\n\nWe assume quasi-steady state for the galactic evolution. Our theoretical calculation performed for large rA shows\nthat the energy fluxes of the right-hand-side of Eq. (6) is proportional to \u03a0E b /E u , where E u is the kinetic energy,\nand \u03a0 is the total energy flux or energy supply rate. Using Kolmogorov's spectrum, we obtain\n!\n\u221a\nu\nE\nt\n(7)\nE b (t) \u2248 E b (0) exp\nL(K u )3/2\nwhere L is the large-length of the system. Clearly,\n\u221a the magnetic energy grows exponentially in the early17periods,\nE u , which is the eddy turnover time. Taking L \u2248 10 km and\nand\nthe\ntime-scale\nof\ngrowth\nis\nof\nthe\norder\nof\nL/\n\u221a\nu\nE \u2248 10km/sec, we obtain the growth time-scale to be 1016 sec or 3 \u00d7 108 years, which is in the expected range21 .\nHence, we are able to construct a nonlinear and dynamically consistent galactic dynamo based on the energy fluxes.\nIn this model, magnetic energy grows exponentially, and the growth time-scale is reasonable21.\nTo recapitulate, we address the dynamo problem in the light of turbulent energy flux. Our approach is very different\nfrom the \u03b1-dynamo picture. Our theoretical calculation, based on perturbative field theory, shows large amount of\n2\n\n\fenergy transfer from large-scale velocity field to large-scale magnetic field. This transfer occurs in both helical and\nnonhelical MHD. We believe magnetic energy growth is primarily due to this energy transfer. Regarding magnetic\nenergy flux, there is (a) nonhelical forward flux from large scales to small scales, and (b) helical inverse transfer from\nsmall scales to large scales. The net magnetic energy transfer, however, is positive.\nWe have constructed a model of galactic dynamo based on our energy flux results. We find that magnetic energy\ngrows exponentially, and our estimate of its growth time-scale is consistent with the current observational estimates21 .\n\n[1] Steenbeck, M., Krause, F., & R\u00e4adler, K.-H.

Various energy fluxes in wavenumber space for parameter (rA = 5000, rK = 0.1, rM = \u22120.1). The illustrated\nwavenumber spheres contain u < and b < modes, while u > and b > are modes outside these spheres. The energy fluxes are\nu<\nb<\nfrom large-scale u to small-scale u (\u03a0u<\nu> ), large-scale u to small-scale b (\u03a0b> ), large-scale b to small-scale u (\u03a0u> ), large-scale\nu<\nb to small-scale b (\u03a0b<\n),\nand\nlarge-scale\nu\nto\nlarge-scale\nb\n(\u03a0\n).\nThe\nvelocity\nfields\nat\nlarge-scale\nare\nforced,\nand\nthe net input\nb>\nb<\nenergy is 1 unit.
