Introduction\nCurves in Computer Aided Geometric Design and in Visualization are often given\nin parametric form. Their singularities are usually points where the shape of the\ngraphic gets more complicated. Hence, understanding the nature and character of\nthese singular points has been an active area of research in the last years, see for\ninstance [6, 12, 16, 13, 5, 4, 10] and the references therein.\nIn this article, we will focus on parametric plane curves defined over the complex\nnumbers, although our results are valid for any field of characteristic zero, and the\ncomputational aspects can be performed also on any field containing the coefficients\nof the input polynomials. Let a, b, c \u2208 C[s, v] be homogeneous polynomials of the\nsame degree n \u2265 3 with gcd(a, b, c) = 1, such that the map\n(1)\n\n\u03c6:\n\n\u2192\nP2C\nP1C\n(s0 : v0 ) 7\u2192 (a(s0 , v0 ) : b(s0 , v0 ) : c(s0 , v0 ))\n\nparameterizes a plane rational algebraic curve C birationally onto its image (which\nis equivalent to say that the degree of C is n). As it was shown by Abhyankar\nin [1] for c = v n , and later in general by Sendra and Winkler in [15], Gutierrez,\nRubio and Yie in [9], and P\u00e9rez-Diaz in [13] among others, the parameterization\n\u03c6 can be used to detect the singular points of C, which are those P \u2208 C such that\ntheir multiplicity mP (C) is strictly greater than 1. As \u03c6 is generically one-to-one,\nmP (C) is actually the number of points in the preimage of \u03c6\u22121 (P ) counted with\nmultiplicities (for a proper \"parameterization-free\" definition of mP (C) as well as\nits properties, see [1, 19]). This explains why from a computational point of view,\nthe parameterization \u03c6 provides a lot of information about the singularities of C.\nThe purpose of this paper is to shed some light in this area.\nWe will use the notation and definitions given in [3] (see also [17]). Let {P1 , . . . , Pr }\nbe the proper singular points of C, and for all i = 1, . . . , r denote by\n\u2022 zij , j \u2208 Ii , the irreducible branch-curves of C at Pi ,\n\u2022 (ti,j : ui,j ), j \u2208 Ii , the point of P1C such that zij (ti,j : ui,j ) = Pi ,\nDate: October 26, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

If c = v n , then it is shown in [1] that there exists\n0 6= \u03b3 \u2208 C such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nY\nF (s, v; t, u) G(s, v; t, u)\n(3)\nRes(s,v)\n,\n=\u03b3\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000fi,j\nsu \u2212 tv\nsu \u2212 tv\ni=1,...,r\nj\u2208Ii\n\nwhere for all i = 1, . . . , r and j \u2208 Ii\nX\n\u000fi,j =\nmij,h (mPj,h\nh (C) \u2212 1).\nh\u22650\n\nFrom now on we will most of the time omit the nonzero constants. Hence, all\nidentities involving polynomials should be understood up to a nonzero \u03b3 \u2208 C.\nLet BF,G (t, u) \u2208 C[t, u]n\u00d7n be the square B\u00e9zout matrix built from F (s, v; t, u),\nG(s, v, t; u) regarded as polynomials in the variables (s, v) (see Section 5 for its\nprecise definition and construction). Clearly, BF,G (t, u) does not have maximal\nrank as su \u2212 tv is a common factor of both F and G. In [6], Chiohn and Sederberg\nshowed that by analyzing the maximal minors of this matrix, one can obtain all the\nsingular points of C in a very direct way. This approach was improved and refined\nby Chen, Wang and Liu in [5], where (2) is replaced with\n(4)\n\np\u03c6 (s, v; t, u) = p1 (s, v)a(t, u) + p2 (s, v)b(t, u) + p3 (s, v)c(t, u)\nq\u03c6 (s, v; t, u) = q1 (s, v)a(t, u) + q2 (s, v)b(t, u) + q3 (s, v)c(t, u),\n\nwith {p, q} := {(p1 , p2 , p3 ), (q1 , q2 , q3 )} being a basis of the free C[s, v]-module of\nsyzygies of (a, b, c). Suppose w.l.o.g. that deg(p) \u2264 deg(q) and set \u03bc := deg(p). We\nthen easily have \u03bc \u2264 n \u2212 \u03bc = deg(q). In the Computer Aided Geometric Design\ncommunity, the set {p, q} is called a \u03bc-basis of the parameterization \u03c6.\nLet now Bp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) \u2208 C[t, u](n\u2212\u03bc)\u00d7(n\u2212\u03bc) be the hybrid B\u00e9zout matrix associated to p\u03c6 (s, v; t, u), q\u03c6 (s, v; t, u) (for a definition of hybrid B\u00e9zout matrices, se also\nSection 5). It is shown in [5] that by computing the invariant factors of this matrix,\none gets some kind of stratification of the singularities of C with respect to their\nmultiplicities (Theorem 4 in [5]). This stratification is well understood when all\ni\nthe singularities of C are ordinary (i.e. when there are no virtual points Pj,h\nwith\nh > 0) and one can get an explicit description of the invariant factors of this matrix\nin terms of the singular points of C and their multiplicities (Theorems 5 and 6 in\n[5]).\nIn the case where C has singularities that are not ordinary, Chen, Wang and Liu\nstated a couple of conjectures (Conjectures 1 and 2 in [5]) relating the invariant\nfactors with the multiplicity of the virtual points appearing in the process of desingularization of the curve. The main result of this paper is a complete factorization\nof the singular factors of Bp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) and as a consequence a complete proof and\nclarification of both conjectures.\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n3\n\nTo be more precise, let Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) be the Sylvester matrix of (4). It is simply\nthe square (n \u00d7 n)-matrix of the C[t, u]-linear map\n(5) C[t, u] \u2297C C[s, v]n\u2212\u03bc\u22121 \u2295 C[t, u] \u2297C C[s, v]\u03bc\u22121\n\n\u2192\n\nC[t, u] \u2297C C[s, v]n\u22121\n\n\u03b1\u2295\u03b2\n\n7\u2192\n\n\u03b1p\u03c6 + \u03b2q\u03c6\n\nin the canonical monomial bases (the notation C[s, v]d , d \u2208 N, stands for the\nC-vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree d in C[s, v]). A collection\nof homogeneous polynomials d1 (t, u), d2 (t, u), . . . , dn (t, u) in C[t, u] such that, for\ni = 1, . . . , n the product\ndn (t, u)n\u2212i+1 dn\u22121 (t, u)n\u2212i * * * di+1 (t, u)2 di (t, u) \u2208 C[t, u]\nis equal to the greatest common divisor of the (n + 1 \u2212 i)-minors of Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u),\nis called a collection of singular factors of the parameterization \u03c6. The existence\nof these polynomials is guaranteed by homogenizing with some care the invariant\nfactors of Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, 1).\nThe terminology of singular factors is taken from [5]. Note also that if a, b, c \u2208\nk[s, v] with k a subfield of C, then the singular factors will have their coefficients\nin k. This observation is of importance for computational purposes.\nNow we are ready to present the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 1.1. With the notation established above, we have\ndn\u2212\u03bc+1 (t, u) = * * * = dn (t, u) = 1,\nand for k = 2, . . . , n \u2212 \u03bc\ndk (t, u) =\n\nk\n\nY\n\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000fi,j\n\ni=1,...,r, j\u2208Ii\n\nwhere\n\u000fki,j =\n\nX\n\nmij,h\n\nh such that mP i (C)=k\nj,h\n\nWe will see how this theorem implies Conjectures 1 and 2 in [5] in Section 2 and\nprove it in Section 4. We also point out that the factorization of invariant factors\nof matrices related to this problem is also considered in [10].\nThe reader may have already noticed that we just claimed above that the conjectures posted in [5] where made over the matrix Bp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) instead of Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u).\nWe will show in Section 5 that the cokernels of these two matrices plus a whole\nfamily of hybrid resultant matrices are isomorphic, thus Theorem 1.1 can also be\nformulated over the invariant factors of any of them. Our results in Section 5 can\nbe regarded as an extension of those shown already by Ap\u00e9ry and Jouanolou in [2,\nProposition 18].\nWe will also see in Section 6 that there is an explicit connection between Bp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u)\nand BF,G (t, u), which will allow us to get a complete description of the invariant\nfactors of the latter. As a direct consequence of this, we get a complete factorization into irreducible factors of D-resultants. These are a natural generalization of\nAbhyankar's formula (3) for c = v n . Indeed, in [9], it is shown that if we take\n\u0013\n\u0012\n \u0303 u) := Res(s,v) F (s, v; t, u) , G(s, v; t, u) ,\n(6)\n\u2206(t,\nsu \u2212 tv\nsu \u2212 tv\nfor a general rational parameterization, it turns out that if \u03c6(t0 : u0 ) is a singularity\n \u0303 0 , u0 ) = 0, but there may be other roots coming from curves being\nof C, then \u2206(t\nparameterized by permutations of (a, b, c) see [9, Theorem 3.1], and there was no\n \u0303 u).\nknown analogue of a factorization like (3) for \u2206(t,\n\n\f4\n\nLAURENT BUS\u00c9 AND CARLOS D'ANDREA\n\nIn [4], the first author shows that by replacing (2) with (4) in the definition of\n \u0303 u), one gets a polynomial \u2206(t, u) which factorizes like (3). We will review the\n\u2206(t,\nproperties of \u2206(t, u) in Section 2.\n \u0303 u). In Theorems\nHowever, there was still missing a complete factorization of \u2206(t,\n6.3 and 6.4 we give a precise description of the factors of the D-resultant, completing\nthe information given in [9, Theorem 3.1].\nUnderstanding the algebraic structure of these matrices may lead to new algorithms for studying the geometry of singular points of rational curves. We will\nsee for instance in Example 2.1 that in some non trivial cases one can reconstruct\nthe whole multiplicity graph of C from the invariant factors of these matrices, with\noperations only over the ground field of the parameterization. From a symbolic\npoint of view, this problem has already been studied in [14, 17, 13].\nOrganization of the paper. In Section 2 we introduce some basic definitions\nand results, and also show how Theorem 1.1 implies Conjectures 1 and 2 in [5]. In\nSection 3 we prove the main theorem for curves having only ordinary singularities.\nThe proof of the general case is given in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to show that\nany resultant matrix can be used in Theorem 5. In Section 6, we describe all the\ninvariant factors of BF,G (t, u) and show the complete factorization of D-resultants.\nAcknowledgements.

Preliminary results and the singular factors conjectures\nThroughout this paper, we will work over the field of complex numbers C. However, it should be noted that all the statements and proofs work over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We recall here again that every identity\ninvolving polynomials should be understood up to a nonzero constant.\nLet (x1 : x2 : x3 ) be the homogeneous coordinates of P2C . By Hilbert-Burch's\ntheorem, the first syzygy module of the sequence a(s, v), b(s, v), c(s, v) is a free\nC[s, v]-module of rank 2. Moreover, if \u03bc denotes the smallest degree of a nonzero\nsyzygy, then this syzygy module is generated in degrees \u03bc and n \u2212 \u03bc. A \u03bc-basis of\nthe parameterization \u03c6 is then a choice of a basis of this syzygy module. Identifying\nany syzygy (g1 , g2 , g3 ) with the bi-homogeneous form g1 x1 + g2 x2 + g3 x3 , a \u03bc-basis\ncorresponds to a couple of bi-homogeneous forms p, q \u2208 C[s, v] \u2297C C[x1 , x2 , x3 ] of\nbi-degree (\u03bc, 1) and (n \u2212 \u03bc, 1) respectively, such that 1 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 n \u2212 \u03bc.\nAs C is a rational projective curve, we have that its number of singular points,\ncounted properly, is given by the well known genus formula:\nX\n(n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2) =\nmP (C)(mP (C) \u2212 1)\nP \u2208Sing(C)\n\nwhere Sing(C) stands for the singular points, proper as well as infinitely near, of the\ncurve C and mP (C) stands for the multiplicity of the singular point P on C. Notice\nthat in our case we know that there exists at least one (proper) singular point on\nC, since n \u2265 3.\nIt is a well known fact that Res(s,v) (p, q) \u2208 C[x1 , x2 , x3 ] is an implicit equation of\nthe curve C, meaning that it is an irreducible and homogeneous degree n polynomial\nwhose zero locus is exactly the curve C (recall that the parametrization \u03c6 is assumed\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n5\n\nto be birational onto C). Another interesting property is the following (see also [5,\nLemma 2]):\nProposition 2.1. Let Q = (\u03b11 : \u03b12 : \u03b13 ) be a point in P2C and denote by HQ (s, v)\nP3\nP3\na greatest common divisor of the two forms\ni=1 \u03b1i pi (s, v) and\ni=1 \u03b1i qi (s, v)\nin C[s, v]. Then HQ (s, v) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree mQ (C) and if\nmQ (C) \u2265 1 we have\nHQ (s, v) =\n\nN\nY\n\n(vi s \u2212 si v)mi\n\ni=1\n\nwhere N is the number of irreducible branch-curves of C centered at Q and mi\ndenotes the multiplicity of Q with respect to the irreducible branch-curve z such that\nz(si : vi ) = Q.\nProof. By a linear change of coordinates in P2C , one can assume that Q = (0 : 0 : 1),\nbecause \u03bc-bases have the expected property under linear changes of coordinates.\nBy Hilbert Burch's theorem we have that, up to a constant,\na(s, v) =\n\np2 (s, v) p3 (s, v)\nq2 (s, v) q3 (s, v)\n\nand b(s, v) =\n\np3 (s, v) p1 (s, v)\n.\nq3 (s, v) q1 (s, v)\n\nIf h(s, v) is a divisor of p3 (s, v) and q3 (s, v), then it follows that h(s, v) divides\nboth a(s, v) and b(s, v). Reciprocally, suppose that h(s, v) is a nontrivial divisor of\na(s, v) and b(s, v). Then, as\np1 (s, v)a(s, v) + p2 (s, v)b(s, v) + p3 (s, v)c(s, v) = 0\nand c(s, v) does not share any nontrivial common factor with neither a(s, v) nor\nb(s, v), then h(s, v) must divide p3 (s, v). The same argument works for q3 (s, v) and\nwe deduce that gcd(p3 (s, v), q3 (s, v)) = gcd(a(s, v), b(s, v)). From here, the claimed\nequality follows from the definition of the multiplicity of a point on an irreducible\nbranch-curve.\n\u0003\nRemark 1. As an easy consequence of Proposition 2.1, we have that if Q is a\nproper singular point on C then either 2 \u2264 mQ (C) \u2264 \u03bc or mQ (C) = n \u2212 \u03bc, a fact\nthat has already been noticed in [16].\nProposition 2.1 shows that a \u03bc-basis of \u03c6 provides nontrivial information on\nthe proper singularities of C. It turns out that it also carries informations on the\ninfinitely near singularities of C. Recall that we have the following property:\nX\ni (C) =\nmPj,h\nmij 0 ,h \u2265 mij,h .\nj 0 \u223ch j\n\nAlso, denote with SRes(p, q) \u2208 C[x1 , x2 , x3 ] the first principal subresultant of p and\nq with respect to the couple of homogeneous variables (s, v). It is simply a certain\nminor of the Sylvester matrix of p and q with respect to (s, v) (see e.g. [2, 8, 4] for\na precise definition). The following result is a slight refinement of [4, Section 4].\nTheorem 2.2. We have\n(7)\n\n\u2206(t, u) = SRes(p, q)(a(t, u), b(t, u), c(t, u)) = \u03b3\n\nY\ni=1,...,r\nj\u2208Ii\n\nwhere 0 6= \u03b3 \u2208 C and for all i = 1, . . . , r and j \u2208 Ii\nX\nmij,h (mPj,h\n\u000fi,j =\nh (C) \u2212 1).\nh\u22650\n\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000fi,j\n\n\f6\n\nLAURENT BUS\u00c9 AND CARLOS D'ANDREA\n\nIn particular,\nX\n\ndeg(\u2206(t, u)) = (deg(C) \u2212 1)(deg(C) \u2212 2) =\n\nmP (C)(mP (C) \u2212 1).\n\nP \u2208Sing(C)\n\nProof. Although not stated explicitly under this form, this theorem follows from the\nresults contained in [4, Section 4]. Indeed, the proof of Theorem 4.8 in loc. cit. shows\nthat all the inequalities given in Proposition 4.6, always in loc. cit., are actually\nequalities for the first principal subresultant of p and q. Since these equalities\noccur at the level of irreducible branch-curves, they imply the above theorem which\nrequires the use of the multiplicity graph of C. In fact, the properties (P1), (P2)\nand (P3) in loc. cit. are consequences of this theorem but they constitute the finer\nresult one can state without introducing the multiplicity graph of C.\n\u0003\nNotice that Theorem 1.1 can be regarded as a refinement of the above theorem,\nsince it provides non trivial factors of (7) that are in relation with the multiplicities\nof the singular points of the curve C.\nLet us now show how Theorem 1.1 implies the two conjectures stated in [5]. For\neach proper singular point Pi \u2208 C, i = 1, . . . , r, we have\nY\nY\ni\ni\nHPi (t, u) =\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)mPi (zj ) =\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)mj,0 .\nj\u2208Ii\n\nj\u2208Ii\n\nFor all 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 \u03bc, set\nY\n\nhk (t, u) =\n\nHPi (t, u).\n\nPi such that mPi (C)=k\n\nFrom Theorem 1.1, it is clear that hk (t, u) divides dk (t, u). Actually, we have:\nY\nk\ndk (t, u) = hk (t, u)\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000fi,j ,\ni=1,...,r\nj\u2208Ii\n\nwhere\n(\n\u000fki,j\n\n=\n\nX\n\nmij,h\n\n=\n\n\u000fki,j\n\nh>0 such that mP i (C)=k\n\n\u2212\n\nmij,0\n0\n\nif mPi (C) = k\notherwise.\n\nj,h\n\nTherefore, following the notation in [5, Conjecture 1], we can establish the validity\nof the first conjecture:\ndk (t, u) = hk (t, u)\n\nn\u2212\u03bc\nY\n\n\u03a8sk (t, u),\n\ns=k\n\nwhere for all pair 2 \u2264 k, s \u2264 n \u2212 \u03bc,\n\u03a8sk (t, u) =\n\nY\n\nk\n\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000fi,j .\n\ni=1,...,r\nj\u2208Ii\nmPi (C)=s\n\nObviously \u03a8sk (t, u) = 0 if s < k (for multiplicities cannot increase through blowing\nup). Moreover, it is not hard to check that deg(\u03a8sk (t, u)) is k times the number of\ninfinitely near and non-proper singularities of multiplicity r above a proper singular\npoint of multiplicity s, which proves and makes more precise [5, Conjecture 1].\nNow, define for all k = 2, . . . , n \u2212 \u03bc the reduced singular factor d \u0303k (t, u) by the\nfollowing procedure:\n\u2022 Set d \u0303k (t, u) := dk (t, u).\n \u0303k (t,u)\n\u2022 Then, for all l = n \u2212 \u03bc down to k + 1 do d \u0303k (t, u) := gcd(d \u0303 d(t,u),d\n.\n(t,u))\nk\n\nl\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n7\n\nTheorem 1.1 then implies that\nd \u0303k (t, u) =\n\nk\n\nY\n\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000f \u0303i,j ,\n\ni=1,...,r, j\u2208Ii\n\nwhere\n\u000f \u0303ki,j = max{\u000fki,j \u2212\n\nn\u2212\u03bc\nX\n\n\u000fsi,j , 0}.\n\ns=k+1\n\n\u000f \u0303ki,j\n\nTherefore\n6= 0 if and only if mPi (C) = k and in this case it is equal to \u000fki,j . It\nfollows that\nY\nY\nk\n(ui,j t \u2212 ti,j u)\u000fi,j =\nd \u0303k (t, u) =\nHPi (t, u)li ,\ni=1,...,r\nj\u2208Ii\nmPi (C)=k\n\nPi such that mPi =k\n\nwhere li is the number of infinitely near points of multiplicity k above Pi , including\nPi . This proves [5, Conjecture 2].\nBefore moving on to the next section, from a computational as well as theoretical\npoint of view, it is interesting to point out that C[t] is a principal ideal domain, and\nhence one can use the theory of invariant factors over principal domains in order\nto get that the matrix Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, 1) is equivalent to a diagonal matrix whose nonzero\nelements are\ndn (t, 1), dn (t, 1)dn\u22121 (t, 1), * * * , dn (t, 1)dn\u22121 (t, 1) . . . d3 (t, 1)d2 (t, 1), 0.\nWe will recall and use this property for proving Theorem 1.1. Notice also that a\nsingle Smith normal form computation of Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, 1) yields all the singular factors\nof \u03c6, after a linear change of coordinates of P1 if necessary \u2013 see Lemma 3.3. Let\nus conclude this section with an illustrative example.\nExample 2.1. Take the\ncurve of degree n = 10:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 a\nb\n\uf8f3\nc\n\nfollowing parameterization of a rational algebraic plane\n2\n\n6\n\n= s2 (2 s + v) (s + v)\n\u0001\n5\n= s3 (2 s + v) 3 s2 + 2 sv + v 2\n10\n= \u2212 (s + v)\n\nThe computation of the \u03bc-basis gives \u03bc = 4 and\n2\n\np = (s + v)4 x1 + s2 (2 s + v) x3\n\u0001\n3\n6\nq = s 3 s2 + 2 sv + v 2 (2 s + v) x1 \u2212 (s + v) x2\nThe associated B\u00e9zout matrix is then a 6 \u00d7 6-matrix from which we get, after dehomogenization u = 1 and a single Smith form computation, the following singular\nfactors\n1\n1\n2\n4\n2\nd6 (t) = (t + 1)6 , d5 (t) = 1, d4 (t) = (2 t + 1) (t + 1) t2 , d3 (t) = (2 t + 1) t,\n4\n4\n\u0001\n1\n6\nd2 (t) =\n43 t6 + 74 t5 + 71 t4 + 48 t3 + 21 t2 + 6 t + 1 (t + 1)\n43\nand reduced singular factors\n1\n2\nd \u03036 (t) = d6 (t), d \u03035 (t) = d5 (t) = 1, d \u03034 (t) = (2 t + 1) t2 , d \u03033 (t) = 1,\n4\n\u0001\n1\nd \u03032 (t) =\n43 t6 + 74 t5 + 71 t4 + 48 t3 + 21 t2 + 6 t + 1\n43\nAlthough it is not always possible in general, we can recover here the multiplicity\ngraph of the curve by using Theorem 1.1. For that purpose, we start by inspecting\nd6 , the non-trivial singular factor with the highest index. We deduce that there\n\n\f8\n\nLAURENT BUS\u00c9 AND CARLOS D'ANDREA\n\nis an irreducible singularity of multiplicity 6 corresponding to the parameter value\nt = \u22121. Looking at the other singular factors, we obtain that this singular point\nhas a multiplicity 4 singular point in its first neighborhood and then has singular\npoints of multiplicity 2 in its third, fourth and fifth neighborhood. So we obtain\nthe first branch of the multiplicity graph, see Fig. 1.\nNow, by inspecting d4 , we deduce that there is a singular point of multiplicity 4\nwhich is formed by two irreducible branch-curves, one, say z1 centered at t = \u22121/2\nand another one, say z2 centered at t = 0. The singular factor d3 then shows that\nthese two irreducible branches split up at the third neighborhood and have the\nmultiplicities given in Fig. 1 in the second neighborhood (the horizontal bar stands\nfor the equivalence relation of the multiplicity graph). Then, since d2 does not\nvanish at t = \u22121/2 or t = 0 the mutliplicity graph at this multiplicity 4 point is\nknown; see Fig. 1.\nFinally, a simple additional computation shows that the discriminant of d2 /(t +\n1)6 is nonzero. Therefore, it only remains to add 3 ordinary double points to the\nmultiplicity graph to complete it.\n\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. Multiplicity graph of the degree 10 rational plane curve\ngiven in Example 2.1\n\n3. The case of ordinary curves\nTo prove Theorem 1.1, we will proceed by induction on the minimal length of a\nresolution of singularities of C. The initial step would then correspond to the case\nwhere C is an ordinary curve, i.e. C has only ordinary singularities. Although a\nproof of this result already appeared in [5, Theorem 5], we provide in this section\nan alternative proof for the sake of completeness and also as the preparation for\nthe proof of Theorem 1.1.\nWe start by recalling very briefly some results of invariant factors and Fitting\nideals theory we will need in the sequel. The reader may consult any book on\nAlgebra like [11, Chapter III, \u00a77 and Chapter XIX, \u00a72] for proofs of these statements.\nLet R be a principal ideal domain and M a finitely generated R-module. There\nexists a sequence of non invertible elements (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1` ) such that\ni) For all i = 1, . . . , ` \u2212 1, \u03b1i divides \u03b1i+1 .\nii) M is isomorphic to (\u03b1R1 ) \u2295 (\u03b1R2 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 (\u03b1R` ) .\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n9\n\nThe elements \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1` are unique up to multiplication by a unit and are called\nthe invariant factors of the R-module M . They can be recovered from the Fitting\nideals of M , denoted Fi (M ), since\nF0 (M ) = (\u03b11 . . . \u03b1` ) \u2282 F1 (M ) = (\u03b11 . . . \u03b1`\u22121 ) \u2282 . . . \u2282 F`\u22121 (M ) = (\u03b11 ) \u2282\nF` (M ) = F`+1 (M ) = * * * = R\nThe smallest integer r such that Fr (M ) 6= 0 is called the rank of M.\nIt is important to notice for further use that the Fitting invariants of M commute\nwith localization: if S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R not containing the\nzero element, then for every integer \u03bd \u2265 0 we have\n(8)\n\nF\u03bd (M )RS = F\u03bd (MS )\n\nAlso, the Fitting invariants of M can be computed from any finite R-presentation\nof M . Such a presentation corresponds to a matrix, say A, with entries in R. The\nabove results mean that this matrix is equivalent to a diagonal matrix, sometimes\ncalled the Smith normal form of A, whose nonzero elements are the invariant factors\nof M = coker(A).\nWe will also use later in the text the following result which is due to Thompson\n[18].\nTheorem 3.1. Let A, B, C be three square matrices with entries in R such that\nAB = C. If \u03b11 |\u03b12 | . . . |\u03b1n , \u03b21 |\u03b22 | . . . |\u03b2n , \u03b31 |\u03b32 | . . . |\u03b3n are the invariant factors of\nA, B, and C respectively, then\n\u03b1i1 \u03b1i2 * * * \u03b1im \u03b2j1 \u03b2j2 * * * \u03b2jm |\u03b3i1 +j1 \u22121 \u03b3i2 +j2 \u22122 * * * \u03b3im +jm \u2212m\nwhenever the integer subscripts satisfy\n1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < * * * < im , 1 \u2264 j1 < j2 < * * * < jm , im + jm \u2264 m + n.\nNow, we examine the behavior of the singular factors under linear change of\ncoordinates, it will also be very useful in the sequel.\nLemma 3.2. The singular factors of a proper parameterization do not depend\nneither on the choices of the \u03bc-basis nor the coordinates of P2 .\nProof. Indeed, a change of \u03bc-bases or a change of coordinates of P2 correspond\nto elementary transformation of the Sylvester matrix Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u). Therefore, its\nFitting invariants remains unchanged so that the same holds for their codimension\none part.\n\u0003\nRecall that a linear change of coordinates of P1 , that is to say an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\n\u03c8 : P1 \u2212\n\u2192 P1 : (t0 : u0 ) 7\u2192 (\u03b1t0 + \u03b2u0 : \u03b4t0 + \u03b3u0 )\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b3 \u2208 C and \u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4 6= 0, corresponds to the isomorphism of graded\nrings (\"base change\" map)\n\u223c\n\n\u03c8 ] : C[t, u] \u2212\n\u2192 C[t0 , u0 ]\nt\n\n7\u2192\n\n(\u03b3t0 \u2212 \u03b2u0 )/(\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4)\n\nu\n\n7\u2192\n\n(\u03b4t0 \u2212 \u03b1u0 )/(\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4).\n\nThe following lemma shows that computing singular factors \"commutes\" with linear\nchanges of coordinates of P1 .\nLemma 3.3. Let d1 (t, u), d2 (t, u), . . . , dn (t, u) be the singular factors of the parameterization \u03c6 of C and let \u03c8 be a linear change of coordinates in P1 . Then, the\nhomogeneous polynomials in C[t0 , u0 ]\n\u03c8 ] (d1 (t, u)), \u03c8 ] (d2 (t, u)), . . . , \u03c8 ] (dn (t, u))\n\n\f10\n\nLAURENT BUS\u00c9 AND CARLOS D'ANDREA\n\nare the singular factors of the parameterization \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 : P1 \u2192 P2 of C.\nProof. It is not hard to check that if {p, q} is a \u03bc-basis of \u03c6 then \u03c8 ] (p), \u03c8 ] (q) is a\n\u03bc-basis of \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8. Now, the map \u03c8 ] gives a C[t, u]-module structure to C[t0 , u0 ] so\nthat the Sylvester matrix obtained by the change of coordinates \u03c8 is nothing but\nSp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) \u2297C[t,u] C[t0 , u0 ]. Therefore, by the right-exactness of tensor product we\ndeduce that the Fitting ideals of the cokernel of Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) \u2297C[t,u] C[t0 , u0 ] are equal\nto the Fitting ideals of Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) tensored with C[t0 , u0 ] over C[t, u]. It follows\nthat the same property holds for the codimension one part of these Fitting ideals.\nHence, the lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nLet M stand for the cokernel of the Sylvester matrix Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, 1) defined in (5).\nNote that M is a C[t]-module.\nProposition 3.4. With above notation, we have F0 (M ) = 0 and F1 (M ) = (\u2206(t, 1));\nin particular, M has rank 1. Moreover, F` (M ) = R for all ` > n \u2212 \u03bc.\nProof. Since (5) provides a finite presentation of M , one can compute the Fitting\ninvariants of M as the determinantal ideals of (5), namely the Sylvester matrix of\np\u03c6 and q\u03c6 . Thus, F0 (M ) is generated by the determinant of this Sylvester matrix,\nwhich is equal to zero.\nRecall the following classic property of the Sylvester matrix: the corank of the\nSylvester matrix of two given polynomials is equal to the degree of the gcd of these\ntwo polynomials. So, by using Proposition 2.1 and Remark 1, we have that the\nFitting invariants of M are supported on the singular locus of C and F` (M ) = A\nfor all ` > n \u2212 \u03bc since there are no singular points on C of multiplicity > n \u2212 \u03bc.\nTo prove that F1 (M ) = (\u2206(t, 1)), we proceed as follows: let\nP (s, v; t)\nQ(s, v; t)\n\n=\n=\n\np\u03c6 (s,v;t,1)\ns\u2212t v\nq\u03c6 (s,v;t,1)\ns\u2212t v .\n\nApplying the results given in [8, Theorem 2.2], we get that\n(9)\n\nS1 (p\u03c6 , q\u03c6 ; s, v) = Res(s,v) (P (s, v; t), Q(s, v; t)) (s \u2212 t v)v n\u22123 ,\n\nwhere S1 denotes the first subresultant polynomial operator applied to the sequence\np\u03c6 , q\u03c6 with respect to the homogeneous variables (s, v). By taking leading coefficients with respect to s in both sides of the latter equality, we get\n\u2206(t, 1) = SRes(p, q)(a(t, 1), b(t, 1), c(t, 1)) = Res(s,v) (P (s, v; t), Q(s, v; t)),\nthe first equality is given by Theorem 2.2.\nNow, we can decompose the map (5) as the composition between:\nC[t] \u2297C C[s, v]n\u2212\u03bc\u22121 \u2295 C[t] \u2297C C[s, v]\u03bc\u22121\n\u03b1\u2295\u03b2\n\n\u03c81\n\n\u2192\nC[t] \u2297C C[s, v]n\u22122\nq (s,v;t,1)\np\u03c6 (s,v;t,1)\n7\n\u2192\n\u03b1 s\u2212tv + \u03b2 \u03c6 s\u2212tv\n\nand\nC[t] \u2297C C[s, v]n\u22122\n\u03b3\n\n\u00d7(s\u2212tv)\n\n\u2192\n7\u2192\n\nC[t] \u2297C C[s, v]n\u22121\n(s \u2212 tv)\u03b3.\n\nBy setting v = 1, it is now clear that all the minors of size (n \u2212 1) in the\nmatrix S(a(t, 1), b(t, 1), c(t, 1)) are linear combinations of maximal minors of \u03c81\ntimes maximal minors of the multiplication map in the right. If we build the\nmatrices of these morphisms using the basis {(s\u2212tv)j sn\u22121\u2212j } instead of {sj v n\u22121\u2212j }\nand compute the matrices of these linear transformations, then the morphism of\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\nmultiplication by s \u2212 tv would have\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ec 1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ed .\n0\n\n11\n\nan n \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrix of the form\n\uf8f6\n0 ... 0\n0 ... 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1 ... 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n.. . .\n.. \uf8f7\n. . \uf8f8\n.\n0\n\n...\n\n1\n\nThis essentially implies that in these bases there is only one nonzero minor of\n\u03c81 to be considered, and due to (9), it is easy to see that this minor is actually\nSRes(p, q)(a(t, 1), b(t, 1), c(t, 1)) = Res(s,v) (P (s, v; t), Q(s, v; t)).

Perform a sufficiently general linear change of coordinates in P2 in such a\nway that there are no singularities of C at {x3 = 0}, and then apply Proposition\n3.4 and Lemma 3.3.\n\u0003\nRemark 2. If instead of P (s, v; t), Q(s, v; t) we used in the proof of Proposition 3.4\nF (s,v;t,1) G(s,v;t,1)\nthen we would not have \u2206(t, 1) equals to the resultant of these\ns\u2212tv ,\ns\u2212tv\ntwo polynomials anymore, as we may loose some kind of uniqueness by allowing\nthis symmetry (see for instance the statement of Theorem 3.1 in [9]). We will give\na proper factorization of this polynomial in Section 6.\nProposition 3.6. For any proper singularity Q on C, the polynomial HQ (t, u)\ndefined in Proposition 2.1 divides dmQ (C) (t, u). Also, we have that HQ (t, u) and\n\u0001\ndk (t, u) are coprime for all k > mQ (C) = deg HQ (t, u) .\nP3\nProof. Let Sp,q (x1 , x2 , x3 ) be the Sylvester matrix of the polynomials i=1 xi pi (s, v)\nP3\nand i=1 xi qi (s, v) with respect to the homogeneous variables (s, v). Its entries are\nlinear forms in C[x1 , x2 , x3 ]. Therefore, its determinantal ideals, denoted Ik (\u2212),\nk = 1, . . . , n, are homogeneous ideals in C[x1 , x2 , x3 ].\nThen, by using Proposition 2.1 we deduce that\nV (Ik (Sp,q (x1 , x2 , x3 ))) = \u2205 \u2282 P2C\nfor all k = 1, . . . , \u03bc, as there cannot be any common factor of degree more than\nn \u2212 \u03bc of these two forms after specializing the xi (see Remark 1). It follows then\nthat\nV (Ik (Sp,q (a(t, u), b(t, u), c(t, u)))) = \u2205 \u2282 P1C\nfor all k = 1, . . . , \u03bc, and this implies dk (t, u) = 1 for all k > n \u2212 \u03bc.\nNow, assume for simplicity that Q = (0 : 0 : 1) as both HQ (t, u) and dmQ (C) (t, u)\nare invariant under linear changes of coordinates in P2C , and set m := deg(HQ (t, u)).\nAs we did above, we have Q \u2208\n/ V (Ik (Sp,q (x1 , x2 , x3 ))) for all k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 m which\nimplies that HQ (t, u) and dk (t, u) are relatively prime polynomials for all k > m. On\nthe other hand, Q \u2208 V (In\u2212m+1 (Sp,q (x1 , x2 , x3 ))), that is In\u2212m+1 (Sp,q (x1 , x2 , x3 )) \u2282\n(x1 , x2 ), and hence\nIn\u2212m+1 (Sp,q (a(t, u), b(t, u), c(t, u))) \u2282 (a(t, u), b(t, u)) \u2282 (HQ (t, u)) \u2282 C[t, u]\nn\u2212m\n\n2\n\nIt follows that HQ (t, u) divides dn\u22121 (t, u)\n* * * dm+1 (t, u) dm (t, u). As it is con\u2212m\n2\nprime with dn\u22121 (t, u)\n* * * dm+1 (t, u) , we conclude that HQ (t, u) divides dm (t, u).\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nLAURENT BUS\u00c9 AND CARLOS D'ANDREA\n\nAs a corollary we recover Theorem 5 in [5].\nCorollary 3.7.

By Proposition 3.6, HQ (t, u) divides dmQ (t, u). Note that if Q 6= Q0 , then\nthe polynomials HQ (t, u) and HQ0 (t, u) are coprime as each of them provides an\ninversion formula for Q\nthe parameterization around two different points. We deduce from here that Q\u2208Singp (C): mQ =k HQ (t, u) divides dk (t, u), and hence that\nQ\nmQ \u22121\ndivides dk (t, u)k\u22121 .

Proof of the main theorem\nTo prove Theorem 1.1 we will proceed by induction on the minimal length of a\nresolution of C. Define the following property for any integer N \u2265 0:\n(HN ) : Theorem 1.1 holds for any rational projective plane curve C whose singularities can be resolved after a sequence of N blow-ups, assuming that (5) is built\nfrom a \u03bc-basis of a proper parameterization of C.\nCorollary 3.7 implies that the property (H0 ) holds. Now, assume that C can be\nresolved by a sequence of N blow-ups and that (HN \u22121 ) holds. By hypothesis, there\nexists a sequence of rational projective plane curves\nC = C0 \u2190 C \u0303 = C1 \u2190 C2 \u2190 * * * \u2190 CN \u22121 \u2190 CN\nsuch that each arrow corresponds to a blow-up (quadratic transformation) at a\nsingular point and CN has only ordinary singularities. It is clear that C \u0303 can be\nresolved by a sequence of N \u2212 1 blow-ups, so Theorem 1.1 holds for C \u0303 by our\ninductive hypothesis.\nThe curve C \u0303 is obtained by blowing-up C at a singular point P of C. To simplify\nthe notation, we will hereafter denote by m \u2265 2 the multiplicity of P on C, by zi the\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n13\n\nirreducible branch-curve of C such that zi (ti ) = P, i = 1, . . . , iP and by 1 \u2264 \u03bdi \u2264 m\nthe multiplicity of P on zi .

It satisfies F\u03bd (M )Rpi = F\u03bd (Mpi ) for all \u03bd \u2208 N.\nFrom the proof of Proposition 3.6, we already know that F0 (Mpi ) = 0 and that\nFj (Mpi ) = Rpi for all j \u2265 m, so that\nvalti (dn\u22121 (t)) = valti (dn\u22122 (t)) = * * * = valti (dm+1 (t)) = 0\nMoreover, from Proposition 3.4 and Theorem 2.2 we obtain that F1 (Mpi ) is generated by dm (t)m\u22121 dm\u22121 (t)m\u22122 . . . d3 (t)2 d2 (t) and\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nm\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\uf8ed(k \u2212 1)\n(11)\nvalti dm (t)m\u22121 dm\u22121 (t)m\u22122 . . . d3 (t)2 d2 (t) =\n\u03bdji \uf8f8 .\nk=2\n\nmij =k\n\nRecall that C \u0303 is obtained after blowing up a point in C. We want to assume w.l.o.g.\nthat the point being blown up is (0 : 0 : 1), and that the quadratic transformation\nis X = X 0 and Y = X 0 Y 0 . In order to do this correctly, we will perform a general\nchange of coordinates of P1 and of P2 that will simplify the blow-up computations.\nRecall that the R-module M is not affected by a change of coordinates of P2 thanks\nto Lemma 3.2, and Lemma 3.3 shows that Theorem 1.1 can be proved w.l.o.g. in\nany choice of coordinates of P1 .\nAfter then a general change of coordinates in both spaces, we can assume w.l.o.g.\nthat\n(i) our singular point above is P = (0 : 0 : 1),\n(ii) the only singularity of C on the line {x1 = 0} is P ,\n(iii) the line {x1 = 0} is not tangent to C at P ,\n(iv) \u03c6(1 : 0) is not a singular point of C,\n(v) (0 : 1 : 0) \u2208\n/ C and (1 : 0 : 0) \u2208\n/ C, i.e. gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1,\n(vi) \u03c6(1 : 0) \u2208 {x3 = 0}, which essentially means that degt (c(t, u)) < n,\n(vii) there are no singularities of C on the line {x3 = 0}.\nNow, since we assumed (i)-(iii), we apply the quadratic transformation X = X 0\nand Y = X 0 Y 0 so that the exceptional divisor corresponds to the line X 0 = 0.

So, we\ncan use the following\nLemma 4.1 ([2, \u00a73.3]). Given a commutative ring A and two polynomials f (X), g(X)\nin A[X] such that the leading coefficient of f is a unit in A, then the cokernel of the\nSylvester matrix of f (X) and g(X) is isomorphic, as an A-module, to the cokernel\nof the multiplication by g(X) in the quotient ring A[X]/(f (X)).\nWe deduce that for every prime pi = (t \u2212 ti ), the cokernel of the localized Sylvester\nmatrix M\u0303 is isomorphic to the cokernel of the product\u0010 of the matrices associated to\u0011\nthe multiplication by h(s) times the multiplication by b\u0303(s)c(t, 1)\u00e3(t) \u2212 \u00e3(s)c(t, 1)b\u0303(t)\n\u0001\nin Rpi [s]/ c(s, 1)a(t, 1) \u2212 a(s, 1)c(t, 1) .\nLemma 4.2.

As the leading coefficient of a(s, 1)c(t, 1) \u2212 a(t, 1)c(s, 1) as a polynomial in s\nis invertible Rpi [t], then by using Lemma 4.1, it turns out that the cokernel of the\nmultiplication map is actually isomorphic to the cokernel of the following Sylvester\nmatrix:\ncoker Sylvs (a(s, 1)c(t, 1) \u2212 a(t, 1)c(s, 1), h(s)) \u2297 Rpi [t]\n' cokerSylvs (a(t, 1)c(s, 1), h(s)) \u2297 Rpi [t].\nThe matrix Sylvs (a(t, 1)c(s, 1), h(s)) has m = deg(h) rows multiplied by a(t, 1),\nand also has maximal rank as Ress (c(s, 1), h(s)) 6= 0. This means that all the\nFitting ideals of this matrix are not zero, and moreover from i = n + 1 to n + h\nthey are multiples of a(t, 1)i\u22121 . From here, the claim follows straightforwardly. \u0003\nNow we are ready for dealing with the inductive step and complete the proof\nof the main Theorem.

Cokernels of resultant matrices\nIn this section, we show that the singular factors can be computed not only from\nthe Sylvester matrix of the \u03bc-basis, but from a collection of matrices of smaller\nmatrix known as the hybrid B\u00e9zout matrices.\nLet R be a commutative ring, m, n \u2208 N with n \u2265 m \u2265 1, and\nf (t) =\ng(t) =\n\na0 + a1 t + . . . + an tn ,\nb0 + b1 t + . . . + bm tm\n\npolynomials in R[t].\nFor k = 0, . . . , m \u2212 1, set\nfk (t) := an tn\u2212m+k + an\u22121 tn\u2212m+k\u22121 + . . . + am\u2212k ,\ngk (t) := bm tk + bm\u22121 tk\u22121 + . . . + bm\u2212k ,\nand define\npk (t) := gk (t)f (t) \u2212 fk (t)g(t).\nNote that as\nf (t)\n\n=\n\nfk (t)tm\u2212k + am\u2212k\u22121 tm\u2212k\u22121 + . . . + a1 t + a0\n\ng(t)\n\n=\n\ngk (t)tm\u2212k + bm\u2212k\u22121 tm\u2212k\u22121 + . . . + b1 t + b0 ,\n\nthen it turns out that deg(pk (t)) \u2264 n \u2212 1 \u2200 k = 0, . . . m \u2212 1.\nFor j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , m}, we consider the following map of R-modules of finite rank:\n\u03c8j : Rj \u2295 R[t]\u2264m\u2212j\u22121 \u2295 R[t]\u2264n\u2212j\u22121\n\u0001\nei , a(t), b(t)\n\n\u2192 R[t]\u2264m+n\u2212j\u22121\n7\u2192 pm\u2212j+i\u22121 (t) + a(t)f (t) + b(t)g(t)\n\nIt is easy to see that \u03c80 is the Sylvester map of (f, g). We will call \u03c8m the hybrid\nB\u00e9zout map of these polynomials, and its matrix in the monomial bases is what we\nhave referred to as the hybrid B\u00e9zout matrix all along the text. If n = m, we just\ncall them B\u00e9zout map and B\u00e9zout matrix respectively. For 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m \u2212 1, \u03c8j it\nis also a hybrid type map in the sense that it has a piece of Sylvester type and a\npiece of B\u00e9zout.\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n17\n\nIn [2, Proposition 18] it is shown that if the leading coefficients of f and g\ngenerate R, then the cokernels of \u03c80 and \u03c8m are isomorphic.

Let p\u03c6 (s, 1; t), q\u03c6 (s, 1; t) \u2208 C[s, t] be the specialization in v = 1 of the\npolynomials defined in (4). If \u03c6(1 : 0) is not a singular point on C, then the leading\ncoefficients of these two polynomials with respect to s are coprime in C[t].\nP3\nP3\nProof. Note that the leading coefficients of i=1 pi (s, 1)xi and i=1 qi (s, 1)xi are\ntwo linear forms, say Lp (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and Lq (x1 , x2 , x3 ) in C[x1 , x2 , x3 ] that are Clinearly independent, otherwise by making a reversible linear combination of these\nelements, one could replace the \u03bc-basis (p\u03c6 , q\u03c6 ) with (p\u03c6 , q\u03c60 ) with deg(q\u03c60 ) < n \u2212 \u03bc,\na contradiction.\nNow, it is easy to see that these two linear forms intersect at \u03c6(1 : 0), and as they\nare linearly independent, this is their only point of intersection in P2 . From here\nit follows that Lp (a(t, 1), b(t, 1), c(t, 1)) and Lq (a(t, 1), b(t, 1), c(t, 1)) are necessarily\ncoprime in C[t], otherwise they will have a common factor h(t) of positive degree,\nand we would have that\n\u0001\n\u03c6(t0 : 1) = a(t0 , 1) : b(t0 , 1) : c(t0 : 1) = \u03c6(1 : 0)\nfor every t0 such that h(t0 ) = 0, contradicting the fact that \u03c6(1 : 0) is not a\nsingularity of C.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nCorollary 5.3. The singular factors of all the matrices \u03c8j p\u03c6 (s, v; t, u), q\u03c6 (s, v; t, u)\nin C[t, u] are the same for any j = 0, . . . , m, and for any {p, q} \u03bc-basis of \u03c6.\nProof. If \u03c6(1 : 0) is not a singular point on C, then the result follows from Theorem\n5.1 and Lemma 5.2. If this is not the case, by applying a linear change of coordinates\nin P1 , we may assume that \u03c6(1 : 0) is not a singular point on C and the result then\nfollows from Lemma 3.3 which holds not only for the Sylvester matrix \u03c80 , but also\nfor all the matrices \u03c8j , j = 0, . . . , m (the same proof works verbatim).\n\u0003\n6. On the invariant factors of the D-resultant matrix\nIn this section, we will describe the invariant factors of a matrix closely related\nto Sp\u03c6 ,q\u03c6 (t, u) that was originally studied in [6] in order to compute the singularities\nof C. As a consequence we obtain a complete factorization of the D-resultant for\nrational polynomials, introduced in [9].\nLet B(x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 C[x1 , x2 , x3 ]n\u00d7n be the B\u00e9zout matrix associated to the polynomials a(s, v)x3 \u2212 c(s, v)x1 and b(s, v)x2 \u2212 c(s, v)x3 with respect to the homogeneous variables (s, v), and S(x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 C[x1 , x2 , x3 ]n\u00d7n be the Sylvester matrix\nP3\nP3\nassociated to p(s, v) = i=1 xi pi (s, v) and q(s, v) = i=1 xi qi (s, 1) with respect to\n(s, v). Here, as usual, {p, q} is a \u03bc-basis of (a, b, c).\nProposition 6.1. There exists an invertible N \u2208 Cn\u00d7n such that\n(18)\n\nB(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = x3 N S(x1 , x2 , x3 ).\n\u0001\nProof. Set B = Bi,j (x1 , x2 , x3 ) 0\u2264i,j\u2264n\u22121 . We then have\n\u0001\n\u0001\nPn\u22121 Pn\u22121\n1\ni j\na(s, 1)x3 \u2212 c(s, 1)x\n= s\u2212t\nj=0 Bi,j (x1 , x2 , x3 )s t\ni=0\n\u0001 1 b(t, 1)x3 \u2212 c(t, 1)x\n\u0001\u00012\n\u2212 a(t, 1)x3 \u2212 c(t, 1)x1 b(s, 1)x3 \u2212 c(s, 1)x2 .\nBy setting x3 = 0 above, it is easy to see that the right hand side vanishes, and\nhence we have Bi,j (x1 , x2 , 0) = 0 for all i, j. This shows that\nBi,j (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = x3 Ai,j (x1 , x2 , x3 ) i, j = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1\nwith Ai,j (x1 , x2 , x3 ) a homogeneous linear form. If now we substitute\nx1 7\u2192 a(s, 1), x2 7\u2192 b(s, 1), x3 7\u2192 c(s, 1)\n\n\fSINGULAR FACTORS OF RATIONAL PLANE CURVES\n\n19\n\nwe again have that the whole Bezoutian polynomial vanishes. So we conclude that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nn\u22121\nX n\u22121\nX\n\uf8ed\nc(s, 1)\nAi,j (a(s, 1), b(s, 1), c(s, 1))si \uf8f8 tj = 0.\ni=0\n\nj=0\n\nAs c(s, 1) 6= 0, this shows that for all i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1,\nLi (s, v; x1 , x2 , x3 ) :=\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nAi,j (x1 , x2 , x3 )si v n\u22121\u2212i\n\nj=0\n\nis a syzygy of (a, b, c) of degree n \u2212 1. Moreover, the fact that det(B) 6= 0 (as we\nhave assumed gcd(a, b, c) = 1) shows then that det(Aij (x1 , x2 , x3 )) 6= 0 and this\nimplies that the family {L0 , . . . , Ln\u22121 } is a basis of the C-vector space of syzygies\nof (a, b, c) of degree n \u2212 1.\nOn the other hand, it is easy to check that the family\n{v n\u2212\u03bc\u22121 p, v n\u2212\u03bc\u22122 sp, . . . , sn\u2212\u03bc\u22121 p, v \u03bc\u22121 q, v \u03bc\u22122 sq, . . . , s\u03bc\u22121 q}\nis another basis of the same C-vector space. This is due to the fact that the\nmatrix of coefficients of this family with respect to the monomial basis is actually\nS(x1 , x2 , x3 ), whose determinant gives the implicit equation.\nSo, as both sets are bases of the same space, we then get that there exists an\ninvertible N \u2208 Cn\u00d7n such that\n\u0001\nAi,j (x, y, z) = N S.\nFrom here, the proof follows straightforwardly.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs a direct application of Proposition 6.1 we get the explicit description of the\ninvariant factors of the matrix BF,G (t, u) stated in the introduction. Denote with\nDi (BF,G ) the gcd of the (n \u2212 i)-minors of BF,G (t, u).\nTheorem 6.2.

A complete factorization of this polynomial in terms of the\nsingularities of C \u0303 and its multiplicity graph is given in Corollary 3.5.\nFinally, let \u03b4(t, u) := gcd(B(t, u), D(t, u)). Note that we have\nC\u0303(t, u) = q(t, u)\u03b4(t, u), D\u0303(t, u) = h(t, u)\u03b4(t, u).\nTheorem 6.4 (Factorization of the D-resultant, case of different denominators).\nA(t) B(t) \u0001\n, D(t) is proper, then with the notation\nIf the parameterization defined by C(t)\nestablished above, we have\n(21)\n\nh(t, u)\n\ndeg(h)\u22121\n\nq(t, u)\n\ndeg(q)\u22121\n\ndeg(\u03b4)\u22121\n \u0303\n\u2206\n\u2206\u03bd (t, u).\n\u00c3,C\u0303,B\u0303,D\u0303 (t, u) = \u03b4(t, u)\n\nRemark 4. Note that (21) generalizes (19), as in the case of common denominators\nwe have h(t, u) = q(t, u) = 1 and \u03b4(t, u) = c\u0303(t, u).\nProof.
