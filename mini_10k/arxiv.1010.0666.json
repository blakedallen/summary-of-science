Some years ago it has\nbeen found that, starting from the 3D GPE and using\na Gaussian variational approach [3, 4], it is possible to\nderive effective one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional\n(2D) wave equations which describes the dynamics of\nquasi-1D or quasi-2D BECs as appropriate for cigar or\ndisk shapes [5]. For instance, in that derivation of the\neffective 1D equation the trapping potential is harmonic\nand isotropic in the transverse direction and generic in\nthe axial one. The effective 1D equation, which is a timedependent nonpolynomial Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NPSE)\n[5], has been used to model a cigar-shaped condensate by\nmany experimental and theoretical groups [6\u201310]. Similar reduction scheme also exists for a disk-shaped BEC\nleading to a 2D NPSE. (The lowest-order approximation\nof the NPSE leads to a GP-type nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (NLSE) equation with cubic nonlinearity. Different variants of this reduction scheme have later been\nsuggested, which offer certain advantages in some cases\n[7, 8].) Moreover, by using the 1D NPSE, analytical and\nnumerical solutions have been found for solitons and vortices [11]. Recently, a discrete version of the 1D NPSE\n(1D DNPSE) has been obtained [12]. The 1D DNPSE\nhas been used to model a BEC confined in a combination of a cigar-shaped trap and a deep optical lattice\nacting in the axial direction [12]. More recently the 2D\n\n\u2217 lyoung@ift.unesp.br\n\u2020 luca.salasnich@cnr.it\n\u2021 adhikari44@yahoo.com;\n\nhttp://www.ift.unesp.br/users/adhikari/\n\nNPSE, obtained for a disk-shaped BEC subject to strong\nconfinement along the axial direction, has been used to\npredict the density profiles and dynamical stability of\nrepulsive and attractive BECs with zero and finite topological charge in various planar trapping configurations,\nincluding the axisymmetric harmonic confinement and\n1D periodic potential [13]. The reduction scheme has\nalso successfully been applied [8, 14] to the study of a\ndensity-functional formulation [15] for a Fermi superfluid\nat unitarity as well as to the study of Anderson localization in a BEC [16].\nIn a very recent experiment Lamporesi et al. [17] investigated the mixed-dimensional scattering occurring when\nthe collisional atoms of two species of a binary BEC live\nin different space dimensions. This achievement opens\nthe way to the experimental and theoretical studies of\na binary BEC with the components belonging to mixed\ndimensions. In the present paper we consider the dimensional reduction of a binary 3D GPE appropriate for\nthe study of a binary BEC in mixed dimensions. Starting\nfrom a binary 3D GPE we derive a binary nonpolynomial\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (BNPSE) in reduced dimensions by\nusing a Lagrangian variational approach. (The BNPSE\nrepresent a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations\nwith nonpolynomial non-power-law nonlinearities.) We\nalso present a simplified version of the reduction scheme\nfirst, where the reduced equations in the form of a binary\nNLSE (BNLSE) have simpler power-law nonlinearities.\nThe BNPSEs depend on the geometry of the system and\nalso on the inter-species interaction. In fact, the main\ndifference with respect to the case of a single BEC is the\ncoupling between the two BECs, which gives rise, quite\ngenerally, to a integral term in the reduced wave equations. (In the past, a binary 1D NPSE has been derived\nand used [18] to study a binary cigar-shaped BEC, rather\nthan a binary BEC in mixed dimensions as considered\nhere.)\n\n\f2\nWe use the BNLSE and BNPSE to study numerically\nthe static and dynamic properties of a 1D-2D binary BEC\nwhere the first quasi-1D component lies along the z axis\nand the quasi-2D component in the (x, y) plane. For\nsmall nonlinearities both the BNLSE and BNPSE yielded\nresults for density in good agreement with the full 3D\nresult. At larger values of nonlinearities the BNPSE provided better approximation to the full 3D result. We also\nstudied small oscillations of the 1D-2D binary BEC initiated by a sudden change of the radial angular frequency\nof the quasi-2D component. The BNPSE provided a better description of this oscillation over the BNLSE, when\ncompared with the full 3D model, specially for large nonlinearities and large times.\nThe reduced effective BNLSEs with simple power-law\nnonlinearity, but with different dimensionalities for the\ncomponents, are presented in Sec. II. These equations\nare derived by considering the ansatz for the wave function that sets the transverse spatial dependence as the\nGaussian ground states in transverse harmonic traps.\nThe transverse spatial dependence is finally integrated\nout and the reduced equations derived in the usual fashion using a Gaussian variational approach. In Sec. III\nthe BNPSEs with different dimensionalities for the components are derived by taking the ansatz for the wave\nfunction that sets the transverse spatial dependence as\ngeneric Gaussian states which are not the ground states\nin transverse harmonic traps. The reduced effective\nBNPSEs are then derived by a Lagrangian variational approximation which determines the widths of the Gaussian\nfunctions in a self-consistent fashion. In Sec. IV A we\npresent the numerical results, where we compare the densities and chemical potentials of the 3D binary GPE with\nthose of the BNLSE and BNPSE. The binary BEC has a\ndisk-shaped component along the z direction coupled to\na cigar-shaped component in the (x, y) plane. For smaller\nnonlinearities of the 3D binary GPE, we establish good\nagreement between the results for density and chemical\npotential of the effective BNLSE and the full 3D binary\nGPE. For larger nonlinearities better result was obtained\nwith the BNPSE. We also studied small oscillations of\nthe binary 1D-2D BEC initiated by a sudden change of\nthe radial angular frequency of the quasi-2D disk-shaped\nBEC using the BNPSE, BNLSE and the full 3D equations. Again the results obtained with the BNPSE were\nin better agreement with those of the BNLSE. Finally, a\nsummary of our investigation is presented in Sec V.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL FORMULATION FOR THE\nBNLSE\n\nWe shall now explicitly demonstrate the reduction procedure in three different types of binary mixtures: 1D3D, 1D-2D, and 2D-3D. We shall consider a binary BEC\nwhere the trap anisotropy of the two components are\ndistinct. When the component 2 has a fully asymmetric\ntrap, the component 1, due to its specific trap symmetry,\n\nwill be assumed to have a quasi-1D or quasi-2D configuration. The quasi-1D shape emerges when the traps\nin the two transverse directions are much stronger than\nthat in the linear direction. The quasi-2D shape emerges\nwhen the trap in the direction perpendicular to the 2D\nplane is much stronger than those in the 2D plane. In\nthis fashion one could have an effective 1D-3D, and 2D3D mixed configuration for the traps acting on the binary\nBEC described by effective 1D-3D and 2D-3D BNLSEs.\nThere remains one distinct case where one of the components have a quasi-1D shape and the other component a\nquasi-2D shape due to specific trap symmetry of the two\ncomponents. In that case the binary mixture is described\nby a effective 1D-2D BNLSE. We discuss these possibilities in the following and illustrate the corresponding reduction schemes.\nThe action of a system of two BECs is given by [19]\nZ\nA = (L1 + L2 \u2212 g12 |\u03c81 |2 |\u03c82 |2 ) d3 r dt ,\n(1)\n\nwhere the Lagrangian density is\nn ~\n~2\nLj = i (\u03c8j\u2217 \u2202t \u03c8j \u2212 \u03c8j \u2202t \u03c8j\u2217 ) \u2212\n|\u2207r \u03c8j |2\n2\n2mj\no\ngj\n\u2212 Uj (r)|\u03c8j |2 \u2212 |\u03c8j |4 ,\n(2)\n2\nwith Uj (r) the external potential acting on the j-th\nBEC component (j = 1, 2), which is described by the\nmacroscopic wave function \u03c8j (r, t). Here \u2202t denotes time\nderivative,\ngj = 4\u03c0~2 aj /mj , g12 = 2\u03c0~2 a12 /mR , and\nR\n2\n|\u03c8j (r, t)| = Nj , where aj is the intraspecies scattering length for species j and a12 is the interspecies scattering length, mj is the mass of species j, and mR \u2261\nm1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ) is the reduced mass.\nBy extremizing the action A with respect to \u03c81\u2217 (r, t)\nand \u03c82\u2217 (r, t) we obtain the following binary GPE [19]\ni\nh\n~2 2\n\u2207r + U1 (r) + g1 |\u03c81 |2 + g12 |\u03c82 |2 \u03c81 ,(3)\ni~\u2202t \u03c81 = \u2212\n2m1\nh\ni\n~2 2\ni~\u2202t \u03c82 = \u2212\n\u2207r + U2 (r) + g2 |\u03c82 |2 + g12 |\u03c81 |2 \u03c82 .(4)\n2m2\n\nThese two coupled partial differential equations are both\nin 3+1 (space-time) dimensions. In the general case,\nthese can be solved numerically in a routine fashion\n[20, 21]. However, in many situations of interest, when\none or both of the BEC components have extreme distinct cigar and disk shapes and when we are interested in\ndensity and dynamics in axial and radial directions, respectively, the following reduction procedures are of particular use.\nA.\n\n1D-3D binary BEC\n\nLet us suppose that the confining potential of the first\nBEC is\n1\n2 2\n2 2\nU1 (r) = m1 (\u03c91x\nx + \u03c91y\ny ) + V1 (z),\n(5)\n2\n\n\f3\nwhere V1 (z) is a generic potential in z direction, and\n\u03c91x and \u03c91y are the angular frequencies of the harmonic\ntrap along transverse x and y directions.

In Figs. 3 (a) and\n(b) we plot the linear and radial densities for N g1 = 40\u03c0\nand N g2 = 400\u03c0. In this case there is a larger difference\nbetween the results of 3D and reduced 1D-2D models.\nWhat is interesting is that the agreement between the\nresults of the two models does not deteriorate with the\nincrease of g12 up to 128\u03c0.\nFrom the results displayed in Figs. 1 \u2212 3 we find that\nthe BNLSE (28) and (29) provide an excellent account of\nthe actual state of affairs, when compared with the full\n3D binary GPE (3) and (4), specially for small nonlinearities N g1 and N g2 .\nWe next attempt an improvement over the BNLSE\n(28) and (29) of Sec. II by applying BNPSE of Sec. III.\nIn other words, we attempt a solution of Eqs. (48) \u2212 (51),\nin place of Eqs. (28) and (29), to reduce the discrepancy\nnoted in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) between the results of the\n3D and BNLSE. The results so obtained are plotted in\nFigs. 4 (a) and (b) for N g1 = 40\u03c0 and N g2 = 400\u03c0,\nwhich show a significant improvement over the results in\nFigs. 3 (a) and (b). The large discrepancy between the\nresults of the 3D binary GPE and the BNLSE for the\nlinear density of component 1 has virtually disappeared\nin Fig. 4 (a) and that for the radial density of component 2 is significantly reduced in Fig. 4 (b). This shows\nthat although the results from the effective BNLSE of\nSec.

The cigar-shaped\nBEC is perpendicular to the disk-shaped BEC.\n\nFinally, we consider the chemical potential \u03bc1 and \u03bc2\nof the two components calculated using the 3D binary\nGPE (3) and (4), the BNPSE (48) \u2212 (51) as well as\nthe BNLSE (28) \u2212 (29). The equations for the chemical\npotentials are obtained by replacing the time derivative\ni~\u2202t by \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 , respectively, in the dynamical equations for component 1 and 2, respectively. The chemical\npotentials are plotted in Fig. 5 (a) versus g1 N/\u03c0 for\nN g2 = 400\u03c0 and N g12 = 128\u03c0. In Fig. 5 (b) we plot\nthe chemical potentials versus g2 N/\u03c0 for N g1 = 40\u03c0 and\nN g12 = 128\u03c0. The chemical potentials obtained from the\nBNLSE (28) \u2212 (29) are good but those calculated from\nthe BNPSE (48) \u2212 (51) are better approximations to the\nresults obtained from the 3D binary GPE (3) and (4) in\nall cases.\n\nB.\n\nDynamics\n\nNow we investigate if the reduced equation presented\nhere can satisfactorily describe the dynamics of the perpendicular 1D-2D system. For this purpose first we consider the coupled system presented in Figs. 2 (a) and\n(b) with N g1 = 4\u03c0, N g2 = 40\u03c0, and N g12 = 16\u03c0. After\nthe stationary condensate is created during time evolution of the numerical routine using real-time propagation, we reduce the radial angular frequency of the disk-\n\n\f9\nshaped quasi-2D BEC suddenly by 5% (the new angular\nfrequencies being \u03c91\u03c1 = \u03c92z = 10, \u03c91z = 1, \u03c92\u03c1 = 0.95,)\nand study the subsequent dynamical evolution of the system. The relevant dynamics is best illustrated by plotting the evolution of the rms axial size of the cigar-shaped\nquasi-1D BEC and the rms radial size of the disk-shaped\nquasi-2D BEC in Fig. 6 (a) and (b) for two sets of nonlinearities exhibited in Figs. 2 and 3. Here we show\nthe results of the 3D GPE (3) and (4) (3D), the reduced\nBNPSEs (48) \u2212 (51) (NP), and the reduced BNLSE (28)\nand (29) (NL). For both sets of nonlinearities illustrated\nin Figs. 6 (a) N g1 = 4\u03c0, N g2 = 40\u03c0, N g12 = 16\u03c0 and\n(b) N g1 = 40\u03c0, N g2 = 400\u03c0, N g12 = 128\u03c0, the NP reduction produced far better results compared to the NL\nreduction. In both cases the angular frequency of the\nquasi-2D disk-shaped BEC was modified and both the\nNL and NP schemes as well as the full 3D calculation\nexhibited sinusoidal oscillation for the axial size of the\ndisk-shaped BEC right from t = 0. It took some five\nunits of time for similar sinusoidal oscillation to initiate\nin the unperturbed cigar-shaped component due to the\nnon-zero coupling term g12 . The oscillations in rms sizes\nin the NP scheme were always in phase with those of the\nfull 3D calculation. But for larger nonlinearity and at\nlarge times the oscillations in rms sizes in the NL scheme\nare not always in phase with those of the full 3D calculation. The differences between the rms sizes of the NL\nand NP schemes compared to the full 3D calculation were\nconsequences of the same differences, existing at t = 0,\nin the corresponding stationary results in the absence of\nany perturbation in the angular frequency.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper we derived and studied simple binary reduced non-polynomial Schr\u00f6dinger equations (BNPSEs)\nfor the description of a binary BEC where the two components subject to distinct trap symmetries belong to two\ndifferent spatial dimensions. We considered three possibilities: the first component is in 3D and the second in (a)\n1D (cigar shape) or (b) 2D (disk shape), and (c) the first\n\n[1] L. Pitaevskii and S.

The 1D and\n2D configurations were achieved in an axially-symmetric\nsetting with a strong harmonic trap in the transverse radial and axial directions, respectively. The BNPSEs were\nobtained by a Lagrangian variational scheme after approximating the spatial wave-function component in the\ntransverse direction by a generic Gaussian function. A\nsimpler set of reduced equations, the BNLSE with powerlaw nonlinearity, were obtained with a simple ansatz for\nthe 3D wave function where the wave-function component in the transverse direction is taken to be the ground\nstate in the corresponding harmonic trap.\nWe tested the accuracy of the reduction scheme above\nby numerically solving the 3D binary GPE in the coupled\n1D-2D case where the cigar-shaped component is in the z\ndirection and the disk-shaped component lie in the (x, y)\nplane. We calculated the density profiles and the chemical potentials of the two components. For smaller values of inter- and intra-species nonlinearities, the BNLSE\n(28) and (29) with power-law nonlinearity produced results for density and chemical potential in good agreement with the binary 3D GPE. For larger nonlinearities\nthe BNPSE (48) \u2212 (51) produced significant improvement over the BNLSE (28) and (29). We also studied\nsmall oscillation of the binary 1D-2D BEC, initiated by\na sudden change of the radial angular frequency of the 2D\ncomponent. For larger nonlinearities and large times, the\nBNPSE (48) \u2212 (51) produced better results for dynamics\ncompared with the BNLSE (28) and (29). To conclude,\nthe BNLSE (28) and (29) as well as the BNPSE (48) \u2212\n(51) are shown to be very useful to investigate a binary\n1D-2D BEC, where the cigar-shaped BEC is perpendicular to the disk-shaped one. Similar reduced equations\nare derived for other symmetries, such as the 1D-3D and\n2D-3D cases as well as the 1D-2D case where the cigarshaped BEC is in the plane of the disk-shaped one.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nCNPq and FAPESP (Brazil) provided partial support.\n\nRev.
