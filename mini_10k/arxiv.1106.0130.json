This paper presents a less general\nbut more easily accessible approach to using modern differential geometry in\nelasticity theory than those published up to now.\n\n1. Introduction\nModern differential geometry often allows for a clearer, more geometric approach\nto solve physical problems than Gibbsian vector calculus or Ricci calculus (i.e. the\nindex-based form) of Riemannian geometry. Even more importantly, equations\nstated in modern differential geometric terms are not bound to the use of special\nclasses of coordinate systems, such as cartesian or orthonormal ones. It provides\nuseful and powerful concepts such as differential forms and Lie derivatives and\nwith them a generalization of vector calculus expressions like rotation, gradient\nand divergence and of various integral theorems like Gauss' divergence theorem\nor Stoke's integral theorem on planes to just one integral theorem. Furthermore,\ncoordinate transformations in curvilinear coordi-nate systems are often simplified.\nIn general, it is desirable to express equations in a connection and metric ten-sor\nfree manner, using only differential forms and Lie derivatives, thus simplifying coordinate system changes. Unfortunately it is not always possible to express vector\nor tensor equations as equations in such a way. One reason of this is the antisymmetric nature of differential forms of degree \u22652. While e.g. the gradient of a\nscalar function and the rotation and divergence of a vector field can be expressed\nusing differential forms, this is not possible with the gradient of a vector field . It\nis, however, possible to reformulate certain differential equations of vector fields as\nones of differential forms.\nIn electrodynamics, differential forms are already a quite popular way to reformulate maxwell's equations etc. [Sel97] In continuum mechanics, however, there\nDate: December 15th, 2009.\n1\n\n\fDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRIC FORMULATION OF THE CAUCHY NAVIER EQUATIONS\n\n2\n\nare only few steps towards using differential forms, most notably from J. E. Marsden [Mar94] and V.I. Arnold [Arn89]. In [Kan07], the stress and strain tensors\nare introduced as vector or covector valued differential forms of various degree. In\nthat approach, the physical meaning of those tensors are clearer than in the traditional way of expressing them interchangeably as contravariant, covariant or mixed\ntensors. However, vector or covector valued differential forms are a nonstandard\nsubject in differential geometry and usually do not simplify calculations.\nFor that reason, in this paper a path between traditional tensor analysis and the\nvery general and mathematically rigorous approach of [Mar94] is taken, thereby\nrestricting to linear elasticity. Due to their relevance, only static problems without\nbody forces are considered.\nAbsolutely necessary to determine deformations inside a body is a suitable system of differential equations for displacements, stresses or strains, respectively.\nSince displacement fields can be considered as fundamental in the sense that stress\nor strain fields can be determined from them, the cauchy-navier displacement equations shall be reformulated in chapter(2). The resulting set of equations have only\nthe displacement variables as unknowns, so displacement boundary conditions are\neasy to handle in this system of equations. In order to allow also traction boundary\nconditions and to relate stresses, strains and displacements, it is necessary to express the well-known stress and strain tensor of linear elasticity in the same modern\ndifferential geometric formalism . This will be done in chapter (3).\nIt shall be noted that throughout the paper it was assumed that manifolds have\nsufficiently smooth boundaries and boundary values are also sufficiently smooth.\n2. Cauchy Navier's Displacement Equations of Static Linear\nElasticity\n2.1. Basic Definitions. Problems in static linear elasticity consist of finding ei\u2192\nther stress fields that satisfy the equilibrium equation \u2207 * \u2190\n\u03c3 = 0 or, equivalently,\ndisplacements that fulfil the Cauchy Navier equation[Tim70] inside a suitable submanifold B of E 3 :\n(2.1)\n\n\u03bc\u25b3~u + (\u03bb + \u03bc)\u2207(\u2207 * ~u) = 0\n\nIn this article, we will regard the latter equation as fundamental because stresses\nand strains can easily be calculated from displacements. Also, there is no need for\nadditional compatibility equations to be satisfied as is the case for the equilibrium\nequation for stresses or strains.\nDisplacements in elasticity theory are naturally tangent vector fields, e.g. ~u :\nE 3 \u2287 B \u2192 T B. In order to make use of exterior calculus, a corresponding displacement covector field u : E 3 \u2192 T \u2217 E 3 is introduced, which is derived trivially from\nthe displacement vector field by index lowering:\n(2.2)\n\nu := ~ub = g(~u)\n\nHere, g(~u) is the action of the covariant metric tensor on the vector ~u. The\nsuperscript b indicates the index lowering process or association of a covector field\nto a vector field, respectively. The inverse action is the index raising operation\n~u = u# = g \u22121 (u).\n\n\fDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRIC FORMULATION OF THE CAUCHY NAVIER EQUATIONS\n\n3\n\n2.2. Vector Differential Operators in Exterior Calculus.\nLemma. For the differential operators grad, div and rot, applied on vector or scalar\nfields, respectively, the following relationships are valid:\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u2207f = df #\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u2192\n\u2207*\u2212\nu = \u2217d \u2217 u\n\n(2.5)\n\n\u2192\n\u2207\u00d7\u2212\nu = (\u2217du)#\n\nProofs for these relations can be found for example in [Fla90].\n2.3. Cauchy Navier Equation.\nTheorem 1. Given a displacement vector field ~u that satisfies the Cauchy Navier\nequations, then the corresponding covector field u satisfies\n\n(2.6)\n\n(\u03bb + 2\u03bc)d\u03b4u + \u03bc\u03b4du = 0\n\nProof. The correspondence between the divergence or rotation of vector fields and\nexterior derivatives of differential forms is well known. Since, however, there is no\nequivalent of the gradient of a vector field in exterior calculus, the Laplace operator\nhas to be restated using the well known formula\n(2.7)\n\n\u25b3~u = \u2207 * \u2207~u = \u2207(\u2207 * ~u) \u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 ~u\n\nWith this, the Cauchy Navier equation appears in the equivalent form\n(2.8)\n\n(\u03bb + 2\u03bc)\u2207(\u2207 * ~u) \u2212 \u03bc\u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 ~u = 0\n\nNow, using 2.3 to 2.5, we can restate 2.8 in terms of the corresponding displacement one-form u = ~ub :\n(2.9)\n\n(\u03bb + 2\u03bc)d \u2217 d \u2217 u \u2212 \u03bc \u2217 d \u2217 du = 0\n\nA somewhat more concise notation of 2.9 uses the codifferential operator, defined\nin E 3 as\n(2.10)\n\n\u03b4 : \u03a9n (E 3 )\n\u03c9\n\n\u2192 \u03a9n\u22121 (E 3 )\n\u2212\u2217d\u2217\u03c9\n7\u2192\n\u2217d \u2217 \u03c9\n\nif \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (E 3 ) or \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a93 (E 3 )\nif \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (E 3 )\n\nWith this we arrive at the proposed formula\n(2.11)\n\n(\u03bb + 2\u03bc)d\u03b4u + \u03bc\u03b4du = 0\n\u0003\n\n\fDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRIC FORMULATION OF THE CAUCHY NAVIER EQUATIONS\n\n4\n\n2.4. Boundary Conditions. The treatment of displacement boundary conditions\nare trivial: the displacement vector field on the boundary just has to be mapped\nto its corresponding covector field.\nCorollary. Given a displacement vector field ~u that satisfies the Cauchy Navier\nequations and assumes given values ~u|\u2202B on the boundary \u2202B, then the corresponding covector field u satisfying 2.6 assumes the values g(~u) on the same boundary.\nTraction boundary conditions, however, are much harder to handle. It would\nbe desirable to find a way to express traction forces or the elastic stress tensor in\nterms of the displacement covector field, resulting in boundary conditions that can\nbe stated as a set of differential equations in the discplacement covector field. This\nwill be the content of the next and largest part of this paper.\n3. Traction Boundary Conditions\n\u2192\n3.1. The Linear Strain Tensor. According to [Mar94], the strain tensor \u2190\n\u01eb \u2208\n\u2190\n\u2192\n1\nT\n0\n3\ni\nj\nT2 (E ) of linear elasticity \u01eb = \u01ebij e \u2297 e = 2 (\u2207~u + \u2207~u ) can also be written as\nthe Lie derivative of the metric tensor with respect to the displacement vector field\n~u:\n1\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u01eb = Lu~ \u2190\ng\n2\n\u2192\nwith the metric tensor \u2190\ng = gij dxi \u2297dxj . Beware that we need the discplacement\nvector field here, not the corresponding one-form. This is unfortunate, because we\nnow need to map one-form into vector field components and vice versa. However,\nin the case of orthonormal bases and physical vector components this is simple: the\ncomponents are unchanged. Otherwise, index lowering or raising has to be used.\nAs an example, using a general canonical vector base, it shall be shown, that the\nformula above is equivalent to results of classical tensor analysis.\n(3.1)\n\nCorollary. The components of 3.1 satisfy\n1\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u01eb = \u01ebij dxi \u2297 dxj = (uk gij,k + gkj uk,i + gik uk,j )dxi \u2297 dxj\n2\nProof. This can be proven by direct calculation.\nThe Lie derivative adheres to the product rule for tensor products:\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\nL~x (T \u2297 S) = L~x T \u2297 S + T \u2297 L~x S\n\nThis holds for tensor fields of any rank, and therefore especially for scalar functions and one-forms. Thus we have\n(3.4)\n\nLu~ (gij dxi \u2297 dxj ) = (Lu~ gij )dxi \u2297 dxj + gij Lu~ dxi \u2297 dxj + gij dxi \u2297 Lu~ dxj\n\nCartan's \u201emagic formula\" can be applied to calculate the lie derivatives of oneforms:\n(3.5)\n\nL~x \u03b1 = ~x * d\u03b1 + d(~x * \u03b1)\n\nApplied to the canonical basis covectors dxi and afterwards to 3.4:\n\n\fDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRIC FORMULATION OF THE CAUCHY NAVIER EQUATIONS\n\n5\n\nLu~ dxi = dui = ui,k dxk\n\n(3.6)\nLu~ (gij dxi \u2297 dxj )\n\n= uk gij,k dxi \u2297 dxj + gij ui,k dxk \u2297 dxj + gij uj,k dxi \u2297 dxk\n= (uk gij,k + gkj uk,i + gik uk,j )dxi \u2297 dxj\n\n(3.7)\n\nThus we have\n1\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u01eb = \u01ebij dxi \u2297 dxj = (uk gij,k + gkj uk,i + gik uk,j )dxi \u2297 dxj\n2\n\u0003\nCorollary. The components of the linear elastic strain tensor defined as \u01eb\u0303ij =\n1\n2 (ui|j + uj|i ) satisfy 3.2.\nProof. Let's first rewrite \u01eb\u0303ij =\nthe second kind:\n\n1\n2 (ui|j\n\n+ uj|i ) involving the Christoffel symbols of\n\n1\n(ui,j \u2212 \u0393kij uk + uj,i \u2212 \u0393kji uk )\n2\n1\n(3.8)\n=\n(ui,j + uj,i ) \u2212 \u0393kij uk\n2\nIn the last step we used the symmetry property of the Christoffel symbol \u0393kij =\nk\n\u0393ji .\nNow we raise the index of the ui components and substitute \u0393kij = 21 g km (gim,j +\ngjm,i \u2212 gij,m ):\n\u01eb\u0303ij\n\n=\n\n1\n1\n((gik uk ),j + (gjk uk ),i ) \u2212 g km (gim,j + gjm,i \u2212 gij,m )uk\n2\n2\n1\n(gik,j uk + gik uk,j + gjk,i uk + gjk uk,i \u2212 gim,j um \u2212 gjm,i um + gij,m um )\n=\n2\n1\n(gik,j uk + gik uk,j + gjk,i uk + gjk uk,i \u2212 gik,j uk \u2212 gjk,i uk + gij,k uk )\n=\n2\n1\n(3.9) =\n(gik uk,j + gjk uk,i + gij,k uk )\n2\nA comparison shows that \u01eb\u0303ij = \u01ebij .\n\u0003\n\u01eb\u0303ij\n\n=\n\n3.2. The Stress Tensor. For isotropic homogeneous bodies, the stress and strain\ntensor of linear elasticity are related as follows [Mar94]:\n(3.10)\n\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u03c3 = \u03bbe\u2190\ng + 2\u03bc\u2190\n\u01eb\n\nHere, e = \u2207 * ~u is the volume expansion under deformation. For a displacement\n\u2192\n\u2192\none-form u we have e = \u2212\u03b4u = \u2217d \u2217 u. Since \u2190\n\u01eb = 21 Lu~ \u2190\ng we get:\n(3.11)\n\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u03c3 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b4u\u2190\ng + \u03bcLu~ \u2190\ng\n\nBeware that as before, unfortunately, we have to deal with the displacement\none-form and vector field at the same time.\n\n\fDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRIC FORMULATION OF THE CAUCHY NAVIER EQUATIONS\n\n6\n\n3.3.

Given a traction covector field t : \u2202B \u2283 \u2202S \u2192 T \u2217 B and a displacement\ncovector u field satisfying 2.6. The thus given traction boundary conditions are satisfied, if the displacement covector field and its corresponding vector field ~u adheres\nalso to the following equation on \u2202S:\n(3.13)\n\nt = \u2212\u03bb\u03b4un + \u03bc(d(~u * n) + ~u * dn + [~n, ~u]b )\n\nwhere ~n is a normal vector at a given point and n = ~nb its corresponding one-form.\nProof. Since the Lie derivative is also a derivative with respect to scalar products\n(L~x (T * S) = L~x T * S + T * L~x S for any two tensors T and S) we can write:\n\u2192\n2\u2190\n\u01eb * ~n\n\n=\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nLu~ \u2190\ng * ~n = Lu~ (\u2190\ng * ~n) \u2212 \u2190\ng * Lu~ ~n\n\n=\n\nLu~ ~n \u2212 [~u, ~n]b = d(~u * n) + ~u * dn + [~n, ~u]b\n\nNow only the part \u03bben is missing from 3.12, which is equal to \u2212\u03bb\u03b4un.\n\n\u0003\n\nNow let's assume we have a coordinate system on which one of the canonical base\nvectors equals the surface normal ~n. In accordance with cylindrical or spherical\ncoordinates, let's call this coordinate function r, the canonical base vector along\nthis coordinate \u2202r and the canonical base covector dr. Let's also assume that ~n\n(and thus n) are normalized, as well as \u2202r and dr. In this case ~n = \u2202r and n = dr.\nThen we can reformulate 3.13 according to the following\nCorollary. Given a coordinate system with a coordinate function r satisfying the\ndescription above, a traction covector field t : \u2202B \u2283 \u2202S \u2192 T \u2217 B and a displacement\ncovector u field satisfying 2.6, the latter have to adhere to the following equation\n\n(3.14)\n\nt\n\n= \u2212(\u03bb\u03b4u)dr + \u03bc(dur + [\u2202r , ~u]b )\n\nProof. We look at all the substitions one after the other. \u2212\u03bb\u03b4un = \u2212(\u03bb\u03b4u)dr just\nby the definition n = dr given above.\nd(~u * n) = dur follows from the fact that ~u * n = ~u * dr = ur .\n~u * dn vanishes because dn = ddr = 0.\n[~n, ~u]b = [\u2202r , ~u]b also by definition.\n\u0003\n\n\fDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRIC FORMULATION OF THE CAUCHY NAVIER EQUATIONS\n\n7\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn the first part of this article we have derived Cauchy Navier's equation of static\nequilibrium in linear elasticity using only differential forms instead of vector fields.\nThe second part treats the harder problem of expressing strain and stress tensors\nin a more modern differential geometric way, and, finally, how to deal with traction\nboundary conditions.\nReferences\n[Sel97] K.
