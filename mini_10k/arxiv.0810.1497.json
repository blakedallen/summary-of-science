Experiments at the LHC are highly\nexpected to shed light on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In particular,\nvarious extensions of the Standard Model (SM) have been proposed to solve the problem in the SM\nof the hierarchy between the Planck and electroweak scales. Such models predict the existence of\nnew particles at the weak (or TeV) scale which are likely to be accessible to the LHC.\nIn the present work, we focus on one such extension of the SM, the Randall-Sundrum model\n(RS1) [1] with all the SM fields propagating in the bulk of a warped extra dimension [2, 3, 4].\nSuch a framework can address the flavor hierarchy problem of the SM as well. The versions of\nthis framework with a grand unified gauge symmetry in the bulk can naturally lead to precision\nunification of the three SM gauge couplings [5] and a candidate for the dark matter of the universe\n(the latter from requiring longevity of the proton) [6]. The new particles in this framework are\nKaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of all SM fields with masses at \u223c TeV scale. So far, studies of the\nLHC signals from direct production of the radion [7], KK gluon [8, 9, 10, 11], graviton [12], neutral\n\nelectroweak gauge bosons [13], (heavy) fermions [14] and finally light KK fermions present in some\nmodels with extended 5D gauge symmetries [15] in such a framework have been performed (see\nRef. [14] for an overview and Refs. [16] for related studies in other set-ups within the warped extra\ndimensional framework).\nHowever, there are some challenging aspects of this collider phenomenology as follows. Firstly,\nthe KK mass scale is constrained to be at least a few TeV by the electroweak and flavor precision\ntests in part due to the absence of a parity symmetry (analogous to R-parity in SUSY), allowing\ntree-level exchanges to contribute to the precision observables. In addition, the constituents of the\nproton (or SM gauge bosons and light fermions in general) couple weakly to the KK states, whereas\nthe KK states mostly decay to top quarks and longitudinal W/Z/Higgs due to a larger coupling\nto these states. As a result, the golden decay channels such as resonant signals of dileptons or\ndiphotons are suppressed. Finally, given the few TeV KK mass, the top quarks/W /Z resulting\nfrom the decays of these KK states are highly boosted, creating problems in their identification due\nto collimation of their decay products.\nIn light of this situation, it is necessary to study as many LHC probes of this framework as\npossible, especially since there might not be a single \"smoking gun\" for this framework, i.e., a\nvariety of channels can complement each other as far as detecting this framework at the LHC is\nconcerned. In particular, the most widely studied particle is the KK gluon which decays only to\njetty final states, but has the largest cross-section due to the QCD coupling (assuming the same\nmass for all KK particles as in the simplest models). It was found that the LHC reach can be \u223c 4\n\nTeV, using techniques designed specifically to identify highly boosted top quarks. However, it is\n\n2\n\n\fgood to have channels with no jets if possible, since in general such modes are cleaner in the LHC\nexperimental environment.\nAlso, it is obviously important to explore the feasibility of searching for the electroweak (EW)\nKK states (i.e., excitations of \u03b3, W and Z) at the LHC. In fact, decays of EW KK states to\n(longitudinal) W/Z and Higgs offer a possibility for clean final states if these SM particles decay\nto leptons (note that the direct decays to leptons/photons are suppressed as mentioned above).\nHowever, the decay of the KK Z to W W followed by leptonic decays of both W 's has two neutrinos\nin the final state so that the invariant mass of W pair cannot be effectively reconstructed, making\nit harder to identify the signal and to reduce the continuum SM W W background. If one W decays\ninstead to a pair of quarks (we call it \"semileptonic\" decay of the W W gauge boson pair), then\nthe problem is that the two jets from the W are collimated, introducing a larger QCD background\nfrom W + jet. A similar analysis applies to decays of the KK Z to the Zh final state. Finally, one\ncould utilize decays to top pairs for detecting the KK Z using techniques to identify boosted tops\ndeveloped for detecting the KK gluon, but this channel is swamped by decays of the KK gluon to\n(i.e., resonant production of) top pairs, if not by the SM tt\u0304 continuum background.\nGiven this situation, the KK W can provide (a priori) a couple of advantages:\n\u2022 The decays to W Z followed by (clean) leptonic decays of both W and Z can be more effectively\nreconstructed due to the presence of only one neutrino.\n\nThe semileptonic decays of W Z or W h face similar challenges to those of KK Z, namely, QCD\nZ/W + jet background and we can use a jet mass cut in order to reduce this background, i.e., to\ndistinguish a W/Z-jet from a QCD jet.\n\u2022 The decays of KK W to tb\u0304 do not have the contamination from the KK gluon as in the case\nof KK Z.\n\nWith this background, we are thus motivated to study signals for the KK excitation of the SM W\nin this paper. With detailed parton-level simulations for the signal and SM backgrounds, we find\nthe reach for this particle to be 2 (3) TeV with \u223c 100 (300) fb\u22121 luminosity in the tb\u0304, W Z and W h\nchannels, a discovery potential which is roughly similar to that for the KK Z, found earlier in [13].\n\nThe reason for the similar (although slightly better) reach for the KK W as for the KK Z in spite of\nthe expected above two advantages for the former are that, firstly, the BR to leptons for the SM Z\nis smaller than that for the W , making the final significance of the leptonic decays of the W Z from\nthe KK W not much better than in the case of the purely leptonic decays of the W pairs from the\nKK Z. Secondly, we find that a highly boosted top quark can fake a bottom quark so that QCD or\nKK gluon tt\u0304 pairs do manifest as reducible backgrounds to tb\u0304 signal from the KK W . Once again,\nwe use a jet mass cut, this time to discriminate between a t-jet and a b-jet. Anticipating more\n3\n\n\fdedicated analyses in regard to vetoing tt\u0304 background from KK gluon decays, we believe that it is\npossible to make the reach in KK W better than KK Z via the tb\u0304 channel, perhaps comparable to\nKK gluon. Similarly, further improvements in the jet mass technique of distinguishing a W/Z-jet\nfrom a QCD jet or the development of new ones to reduce this QCD background can increase the\nreach for both KK W and Z in semileptonic W W/W Z decays of these KK modes.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we begin with a brief review of the theory of a\nwarped extra dimension and the LHC signals for the KK states, including an outline of the various\ncases we consider for the study of the electroweak charged gauge bosons. We present the total decay\nwidths of W \u2032 's and the branching ratios to various channels in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we calculate the\nproduction cross-sections of the charged gauge bosons at the LHC and present a detailed analysis\nof how to obtain signals for these states. The framework of warped extra dimension is conjectured\nto be dual to four-dimensional (4D) strong dynamics triggering electroweak symmetry breaking, as\nin technicolor or composite Higgs models. In Sec. 5, we then compare the signals that we studied in\na warped extra dimension to the signals for technicolor models discussed previously (since 1990's).\nFurther discussions and conclusions are presented in Sec. 6, where we argue that many of the signals\nthat we study here (including the electroweak neutral gauge boson case studied earlier) might be\napplicable to a wider class of non-supersymmetric models of EWSB. Finally, two Appendices are\nincluded at the end to provide further details for the model, including the couplings of the W \u2032\nstates.\n\n2\n\nReview of Warped Extra Dimension\n\nThe framework consists of a slice of anti-de Sitter space in five dimensions (AdS5 ), where (due to\nthe warped geometry) the effective 4D mass scale is dependent on position in the extra dimension.\nThe 4D graviton, i.e., the zero-mode of the 5D graviton, is automatically localized at one end of\nthe extra dimension (called the Planck/UV brane). If the Higgs sector is localized at the other end\n(in fact with SM Higgs originating as 5th component of a 5D gauge field (A5 ) it is automatically so\n[17]), then the warped geometry naturally generates the Planck-weak hierarchy. Specifically, TeV\n\u223c M\u0304P e\u2212k\u03c0rc , where M\u0304P is the reduced 4D Planck scale, k is the AdS5 curvature scale and rc is the\n\nproper size of the extra dimension. The crucial point is that the required modest size of the radius\n\u0001\n(in units of the curvature radius), i.e., krc \u223c 1/\u03c0 log M\u0304P /TeV \u223c 10 can be stabilized with only a\ncorresponding modest tuning in the fundamental or 5D parameters of the theory [18]. Remarkably,\n\nthe correspondence between AdS5 and 4D conformal field theories (CFT) [19] suggests that the\nscenario with warped extra dimension is dual to the idea of a composite Higgs in 4D [20, 17].\nIt was realized that with SM fermions propagating in the bulk, we can also account for the\nhierarchy between quark and lepton masses and mixing angles (flavor hierarchy) [3, 4]. The basic\nidea is that light SM fermions \u2013 which are the zero-modes of 5D fermions \u2013 can be localized near\n4\n\n\fthe Planck brane, resulting in a small overlap with the TeV-brane localized SM Higgs, while the top\nquark is localized near the TeV brane with a large overlap with the Higgs. Again, the crucial point is\nthat such vastly different profiles can be realized with small variations in the 5D mass parameters of\nfermions, i.e., without any large hierarchies in the parameters of the 5D theory. Due to the different\nprofiles of the SM fermions in the extra dimension, flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) are\ngenerated by their non-universal couplings to gauge KK states. However, these contributions to\nthe FCNC's are suppressed due to an analog of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism\nof the SM, i.e. RS-GIM, which is \"built-in\" [4, 21, 22]. The point is that all KK modes (whether\ngauge, graviton or fermion) are localized near the TeV or IR brane (just like the Higgs) so that\nnon-universalities in their couplings to SM fermions are of same size as couplings to the Higgs.\nIn spite of this RS-GIM suppression, it was shown recently [23] (see also [24, 25]), that the\nconstraint on the KK mass scale from contributions of KK gluon to \u01ebK is quite stringent. In\nparticular, for the model with the SM Higgs (strictly) localized on the TeV brane, the limit on the\nKK mass scale from \u01ebK is \u223c 10 \u2212 40 TeV, depending on the size of the 5D QCD gauge coupling.\n\nHowever, the phenomenology of the TeV-scale KK modes and the SM Higgs is quite sensitive to\nthe structure near the TeV brane (where these particles are localized). For example, the SM Higgs\ncan be the lightest mode of a 5D scalar (instead of being a strictly TeV brane-localized field), but\nwith a profile which is still peaked near the TeV brane (such that the Planck-weak hierarchy is still\naddressed) i.e. a \"bulk Higgs\" [26]. Moreover, the warped geometry might deviate from pure AdS\nnear the TeV brane which in fact could be replaced with a \"soft wall\" [27]. Similarly, in general,\nthere are non-zero TeV brane-localized kinetic terms for the bulk fields [28]. Such variations of the\nminimal models are not likely to modify the constraint on KK mass scale from various precision\ntests by much more than O(1) factors. However, even such modest changes can dramatically impact\nthe LHC signals, especially the production cross-sections for the KK modes.\nWith the above motivation, the \"two-site model\" [29] was proposed as an economical description\nof this framework in order to capture the robust aspects of the phenomenology by effectively\nrestricting to the SM fields and their first KK excitations. In reference [30], it was shown that\na mass scale for the new particles as low as \u223c O(5) TeV is consistent with the combination of\n\nconstraints from \u01ebK and BR (b \u2192 s\u03b3), and it was suggested that models with a bulk Higgs can allow\na similar KK scale. In addition, mechanisms exist to ameliorate such constraints in a parametric\n\nmanner, for example through flavor symmetries [31, 24] or by lowering the UV-IR hierarchy [32],\nas opposed to simply relying on the O(1) effects mentioned above.\nMost of the studies of the KK gluon, graviton and Z (and similarly our study of the KK W here)\nfocus on flavor-preserving fermionic decays (i.e., tt\u0304 for neutral and tb\u0304 for charged case), except for\nRef. [33] which considers flavor-violating decays of the KK gluon. So, it is important to point out\nthat the results of these studies apply to the warped extra dimensional framework independent of\n\n5\n\n\fthe specific mechanism used to suppress flavor violation (beyond that from the RS-GIM mechanism)\nsince the profiles and hence the (flavor -preserving) couplings remain (roughly) the same in all these\ndifferent models for suppressing flavor violation (except in Ref. [32] with UV-IR hierarchy being\nsmaller than Planck-weak). For other studies of flavor physics, see Refs. [34, 35].\nFinally, various custodial symmetries [36, 37] can be incorporated such that the constraints\nfrom the various (flavor-preserving) electroweak precision tests (EWPT) can be satisfied for a few\nTeV KK scale [36, 38]. The bottom line is that a few TeV mass scale for the KK gauge bosons can\nbe consistent with both electroweak and flavor precision tests.\n\n2.1\n\nCouplings\n\nClearly, the light fermions have a small couplings to all KK's (including graviton) based simply on\nthe overlaps of the corresponding profiles, while the top quark and Higgs have a large coupling to\nthe KK's. Schematically, neglecting effects related to EWSB, we find the following ratio of RS1 to\nSM gauge couplings:\n\n3\n\n3\n\nQ Q\u0304 A\ngRS\ngSM\n\n(1)\n\nq q\u0304,ll\u0304 A\ngRS\ngSM\n\n(1)\n\ngtR t\u0304R A\n, RS\ngSM\n\n(1)\n\n\u2243 \u2212\u03be \u22121 \u2248 \u2212\n\n1\n5\n\n\u2243 1 to \u03be (\u2248 5)\n\n(1)\n\nHHA\ngRS\ngSM\n\n\u2243 \u03be\u22485\n\n(H = h, WL , ZL )\n\n(0) A(0) A(1)\n\nA\ngRS\n\ngSM\n\n\u223c 0\n\n(1)\n\nHere q = u, d, s, c, bR , l = all leptons, Q3 = (t, b)L , and A(0) (A(1) ) correspond to zero (first KK)\nxyz\nstates of the gauge fields. Also, gRS\n, gSM stands for the RS1 and the three SM (i.e., 4D) gauge\n\ncouplings respectively. Note that H includes both the physical Higgs (h) and unphysical Higgs, i.e.,\nlongitudinal W/Z by the equivalence theorem (the derivative involved in this coupling is similar for\nRS1 and SM cases and hence is not shown for simplicity). Finally, the parameter \u03be is related to\n\u221a\nthe Planck-weak hierarchy: \u03be \u2261 k\u03c0rc . EWSB induces mixing between EW KK states which we\ndiscuss in App. A.\n\nFor completeness, we present the couplings of the KK graviton to the SM particles. These\ncouplings involve derivatives (for the case of all SM particles), but (apart from a factor from the\noverlap of the profiles) it turns out that this energy-momentum dependence is compensated (or\nmade dimensionless) by the M\u0304P e\u2212k\u03c0rc \u223c TeV scale, instead of the M\u0304P -suppressed coupling to the\n\n6\n\n\fSM graviton.

Instead, the decays are\ndominated by top quark and Higgs (including longitudinal W/Z);\nAlso, these resonances tend to be quite broad due to the enhanced couplings to top/Higgs.\nIn particular, the KK graviton, gluon and neutral electroweak gauge bosons all have sizable\nbranching ratio (BR) to decay to top pairs. Moreover, due to the large mass (few TeV) of the KK\nparticle, the top quarks produced in their decays are highly boosted, resulting in a high degree\nof collimation of the top quark's decay products. Hence it is a challenge to identify these top\nquarks. Nonetheless, using the techniques suggested in Refs. [8, 9] (see also Refs. [39] for related\nstudies and [40, 41] for recent developments of the techniques for detecting highly boosted top\nquarks), discovery for KK gluon up to \u223c 4 TeV mass might be possible. However, in the case\n\nof approximately degenerate gauge KK modes, it is still difficult to extract the signal from top\npairs for electroweak neutral KK modes. The reason is that the top pair signal from these states is\nswamped by the decays of the KK gluon which has a (much) larger cross-section than that of the\nKK electroweak neutral gauge boson due to the QCD coupling and color factors, even though the\nSM tt\u0304 background might be smaller than the electroweak neutral KK signal.\nAs mentioned above, couplings of KK's to longitudinal W /Z are also enhanced similarly to\ntop quarks (of course, only for KK graviton and electroweak \u2013 both neutral and charged \u2013 KK\nmodes) so that decays to these modes also have a significant BR. Such final states are a priori\n7\n\n\fcleaner than top quarks, in particular, since there is no \"pollution\" from QCD or KK gluon and\nthere are decay channels with no jets in these cases. Hence such final states might be the discovery\nmodes for electroweak (both charged and neutral) and graviton KK states. However, we still face\nsome challenges in discovering the neutral electroweak (cf. charged case below) and graviton KK\nstates even with the W/Z final states as follows. The purely leptonic decay in the W W channel\nhas a small BR and moreover, the W W invariant mass cannot be fully reconstructed due to the\npresence of missing momentum from two \u03bd's. Since it is difficult then to apply the mass window\ncut efficiently (i.e., without reducing signal) in order to isolate the events in the resonance region\nonly, the SM background tends to be larger. It is true that the ZZ \u2192 4l final state can be fully\n\nreconstructed, but it has an even smaller BR to leptons than the W W channel and is available\nonly for the the graviton (it is absent for the neutral electroweak gauge KK).\n\nOn the other hand, the semileptonic decay of the W W from the KK Z and graviton has a\nlarger BR. However, just as for the top quarks mentioned above, the hadronic decays of the highly\nboosted W/Z pose a challenge for detection: the 2 jets from W/Z tend to merge so that the QCD\nW/Z+ jet background (where a QCD jet fakes a hadronically decaying W/Z) becomes significant.\nOf course, this background is reducible so that with suitable discriminators between QCD and W/Z\njets such as jet mass, this channel can still be useful [13]. A similar argument applies to decays of\nKK W to W Z.\nIn this paper, we study LHC signals from direct production of charged electroweak KK gauge\nbosons in the framework of a warped extra dimension. Apart from completing the study of spin-1\nKK's, our motivation for this study is that these states possess some new features relative to KK\nneutral electroweak gauge boson and graviton, namely,\n(i) The fully leptonic (and hence clean) decay mode of the W Z channel can be fully reconstructed1 due to the presence of only one \u03bd. Hence, it is expected that the signal to background ratio can be enhanced efficiently by a suitable cut on the W Z invariant mass, namely,\nby simply requiring this mass to lie in the resonance region (unlike for the neutral case discussed above). Moreover, this final state for the W Z has a larger BR than the ZZ \u2192 4l case\n\nfor the KK graviton (although leptonic BR of W Z is smaller than that of the fully leptonic\ndecay of the W W final state for the KK graviton and neutral electroweak gauge boson).\nThe issues with the semileptonic decay of W Z will be similar to that in the neutral electroweak\ngauge boson case.\n(ii) Decays to top + bottom final state of electroweak charged gauge bosons can be also reconstructed even for the leptonic decay mode of the top quark.2 The irreducible SM background\n1\n\nassuming that the missing momentum from the neutrino combined with the lepton forms a W , or assuming that\nthe neutrino 3-momentum is collinear with that of the lepton due to the large boost of the W in the lab frame.\n2\nimposing the on-shell conditions for MW and mt .\n\n8\n\n\ffrom the electroweak process (single top production) can be shown to be smaller than the\nsignal inside the resonance region. Compared to the case of the neutral electroweak KK's\nwhere the decays to top pairs have an irreducible SM background from QCD processes, the\nelectroweak background for the charged case is smaller (and the signal cross-section for the\nneutral case is roughly similar to the charged case). Moreover, if the KK gauge bosons are\ndegenerate, then an even larger background from the KK gluon decays to top pairs completely\nswamps the signal from the electroweak neutral KK boson.\nHowever, even for the charged case, QCD top pairs (from KK gluon or the SM) can be\na significant background if one top quark fakes a bottom quark due to collimation of its\ndecay products. Of course, techniques to distinguish a highly boosted top from a bottom can\nsuppress this background, i.e., it is a reducible one.\n\n2.3\n\nOverview of the charged electroweak gauge boson sector\n\nWe present the full details on the model we work with along with a derivation of all the W \u2032\ncouplings in Appendix (App) A and B. Here, we summarize some of the salient features of the\nvarious cases that we study in detail in the next two sections. First of all, due to the extended EW\ngauge symmetry in the bulk, i.e., SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)X which is motivated by suppressing\ncontributions to the T parameter, we see that there are two charged KK towers (one from each\n\nSU (2) group), before EWSB. We will restrict to the 1st mode of each tower, denoting these states\nby WL1 , R1 , respectively. EWSB will mix these states and the resulting mass eigenstates will be\n\u2032\ndenoted by W\u0303L1 , R1 , or to reduce clutter, simply as WL,\nR.\n\nAs explained above, these charged EW gauge bosons will decay mostly into Higgs, including\n(longitudinal) W/Z and to top-bottom final states. In the appendix, we define two cases for the\ntop-bottom sector (corresponding to different representations for the top-bottom sector under the\nSU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R group) that we will consider in this work. Here we summarize the main features\nof the two cases (details are given in the appendix)\n\nCase (i): tR has close-to-flat profile and (t, b)L has a profile localized very close to the TeV\nbrane in the bulk\nCase (ii): vice versa, i.e., (t, b)L has close-to-flat profile and tR has profile localized very close\nto the TeV brane in the bulk\nRoughly speaking, flavor precision tests tend to (strongly) prefer case (ii), whereas EW precision\ntests have a (milder) preference for case (i).\nSince, as shown in the appendix, the representations under SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)X for\n\nthese two cases are less than minimal, there are various\"exotic\" fermion fields included in these\n\nrepresentations (cf Eqs. (22) and (23)) in addition to the SM fermions. These exotic fermions can\n9\n\n\fW\u2032+ \u2192 X X\n1100\n1000\n900\n\nWidth [GeV]\n\n800\ni)\n\n\u2032 (\nW L\n\n700\n600\n500\n\nW\n\n\u2032R\n\n400\n\u2032R\n\n300\n\nW\n\n200\n\nW\u2032L\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(ii)\n\n100\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\nMW \u2032 [TeV]\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nFigure 1: The total widths of WL\u2032 and WR\u2032 as a function of their masses for cases (i) and (ii).\n\nbe looked for at the LHC but we will not consider them here; instead we will restrict ourselves\nto SM final states. However, in order to obtain realistic values, we will include these exotic decay\nchannels in computing the BR's.\n\n3\n\nW \u2032 decays\n\nThe overlap integrals that dictate the W \u2032 couplings to fermions in the four-dimensional effective\ntheory are presented in Table 10. We then derive the W \u2032 couplings to gauge bosons in the rest of\nApp. B. Armed with these couplings, we are ready to embark on the phenomenology of charged\nEW gauge bosons in this framework. We have incorporated the W \u2032 couplings shown in App. B\ninto the Monte Carlo program CalcHEP [42], using which we present the results below. We will\nrefer to the mass eigenstates W\u0303L1 and W\u0303R1 as just WL\u2032 and WR\u2032 respectively, i.e., we will always\nwork with mass eigenstates while studying the phenomenology. In Fig. 1 we show the total widths\nof the WL\u2032 and WR\u2032 into 2-body final states as a function of their masses for cases (i) and (ii). The\ntotal width increases monotonically with MW \u2032 as expected, and is roughly about 20% or less of its\nmass, with it being appreciably smaller for the WL\u2032 in case (ii). This implies a typically weakly\ninteracting particle and a prompt decay, although the width can still be rather large for a high mass.\nA distinct feature is that the total width of WL\u2032 in case (ii) is much smaller than all the others for\n10\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\nBR(W \u2032L \u2192 X X)\n\nBR(W \u2032R \u2192 X X)\n\n1\n\n1\ntL b\n\nTL b\n\u03c7L tL\n\n+\n\nTL b\n\u03c7L tL\n\n0.1\n\nW h\nZW\n\n+\n\nZW\n\ntL b\n\n0.1\n\n+\n\n+\n\nW h\n0.01\n\n0.01\nud\n\n0.001\n\nud\n\n0.001\n\n+\n\n\u03bde e\n\n+\n\n\u03bde e\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5\nMW \u2032 [TeV]\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n+\n\n2.5 3 3.5\nMW \u2032 [TeV]\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n+\n\nBR(W \u2032L \u2192 X X)\n\nBR(W \u2032R \u2192 X X)\n\n1\n\n1\n+\n\n\u03c7''R tR\n\ntR B''R\n\nW h\ntR B''R\n\n+\n\ntL b\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c7''R tR\nZW\n\n0.1\n\n+\n\nW h\n\n+\n\nZW\n\nTL b\n\n0.01\n\u03c7L tL\n0.001\n\nTL b\n\n0.01\n\u03c7L tL\n\nud\n0.001\n\n+\n\n\u03bde e\n\ntL b\n\nud\n+\n\n\u03bde e\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5\nMW \u2032 [TeV]\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5\nMW \u2032 [TeV]\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: The branching fractions of WL\u2032 (left) and WR\u2032 (right) as a function of their masses for\ncase (i) (top panels), and case (ii) (bottom panels).

This is due to the fact that in case (ii) there is no direct coupling of the WL1 to a third\ngeneration fermion whose wavefunction is peaked toward the TeV brane, unlike in the other cases.\nThis is a direct result of the SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R quantum numbers of the third generation fermions\n(cf Eqs. (22) and (23)). Note however that it can still be coupled to a TeV-brane peaked state via\nWL1 \u2194 WR1 mixing, but this would be suppressed by this mixing angle which is small for large\n\nMW \u2032 .\n\nIn Fig. 2 we show the branching fractions (BR) of the mass eigenstates WL\u2032 (left panel) and WR\u2032\n(right panel) into various 2-body final states for cases (i) (top panels) and (ii) (bottom panels).\nThe largest branching fraction is to fermions peaked toward the TeV brane, which in case (i) is to\nQ3L modes, while for WR\u2032 in case (ii) it is to the triplet containing tR . In contrast, for the WL\u2032 in\ncase (ii) the largest BR is to W h since there is no direct coupling to a third generation fermion\nwith a TeV brane peaked profile. For the WR\u2032 in case (ii), the ZW final state is also available with\na sizable BR. In case (ii) the \u03c7L t \u0304L is available only for MW \u2032 > M\u03c7L + Mt , and therefore exhibits a\nthreshold behavior.\nIn this work we do not study the exotic particles in the final states, and we will focus on the\ntb\u0304, ZW and W h final states in the rest of the paper. The BR into l\u03bd final state is tiny, but due to\nits uniqueness and for completeness we will briefly comment on this mode also. We will perform\na detailed study of these final states considering their various decay modes and obtain the LHC\nreach.\n\n4\n\nCharged Gauge Boson Signals at the LHC\n\nIn this section we consider the production of the charged KK gauge bosons (generically denoted\nby W \u2032 ) and its decay into various SM final states at the LHC. We first present in Fig. 3 the\ntotal production cross-section for the W \u2032 at the LHC versus its mass MW \u2032 via the Drell-Yan (DY)\nprocess. We see that the cross-section can be 100 \u2212 1 fb for MW \u2032 = 2 \u2212 4 TeV. The WR\u2032 coupling\n\nto light quarks is suppressed by the WL1 \u2194 WR1 mixing angle (cf Eq. 24) and the rate is therefore\n\nsmaller by a factor of 2 \u2212 10 in the mass range mentioned above. In the following analyses, we\n\ncoherently sum the WL\u2032 and WR\u2032 (the mass eigenstates) contributions. There are other possible\nmechanisms for W \u2032 production. One may consider the gauge boson fusion W Z \u2192 W \u2032 . However,\n\nthe gauge-boson fusion channel, as first explored in [13], was found to be subleading. As mentioned\nearlier, we adopt the Monte Carlo package CalcHEP [42] to obtain the numerical results in this\nsection. We use the CTEQ6M for parton distribution functions [43].\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 3: Total production cross-section for W \u2032 versus its mass at the LHC.\n\n4.1\n\ntb\u0304 final state\n\nWe first consider the production and decay channel\n+\n\npp \u2192 W \u2032 \u2192 tb\u0304\n\nwith\n\nt \u2192 b l\u03bd\u0304\n\n(l = e, \u03bc),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the leptonic decay modes of the top have been specified for the purpose of event triggering\nand identification. The most distinctive feature of this signal is the large invariant mass of the tb\nsystem near MW \u2032 . Although the missing neutrino makes the event reconstruction less trivial, one\nshould be able to reconstruct the neutrino momentum fairly effectively by demanding the two mass\n2 = (p + p )2 , m2 = (p + p + p )2 . We thus assume that the signal events are fully\nrelations MW\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nl\nb\nl\nt\n\nreconstructible.\nWe select events with the basic acceptance cuts\n|yW,b,b\u0304 | < 3;\n\npT W,b,b\u0304 > 50 GeV,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the y's are the rapidities. For the signal events from a heavy W \u2032 decay, further tightened\ncuts can help for the background suppression.

These are after the cuts in Eq. (5). Also shown are the SM\nsingle top background distributions.\n\nIn Fig. 4, we present the differential distributions for the tb\u0304 final state with a variety of values of\nMW \u2032 = 2, 3 and 4 TeV, for (a) the transverse momentum distribution, and (b) the transverse mass\ndistribution. Also shown on the figures is the dominant source of irreducible background, the SM\nsingle top production pp \u2192 W + \u2192 tb\u0304, seen as the continuum curves. We see the very promising\nprospects for observing the signal with suitably chosen cuts.\n\nWith the decay of the top (into W b), the SM W bb\u0304 will be an additional source of background.\nSince this background largely populates the low mass threshold region, we thus form the following\ncluster transverse mass to help distinguish the signal from background\n\u0012q\n\u00132\n2\n2\nMT W b =\npT W + mW + pT b \u2212 |pTW + pTb |2 ,\nq\nMT W bb\u0304 = pT b + pT b\u0304 + pT 2W + m2W .\n\n(6)\n\nWe show the representative kinematical distributions for the W bb\u0304 final states in Fig. 5, with a\nMW \u2032 = 2 TeV signal (solid curves) for illustration. The SM backgrounds of tb\u0304 (dashed) and W bb\u0304\n(dotted) are also shown for comparison. Figure 5(a) presents the transverse momentum distribution\nfor the W . In Fig. 5(b), we show the distribution of MT W b , the cluster transverse mass of the W\nwith the nearer of the two b-jets. The top-quark mass reconstruction is visible for those events\nwith a real top in the final state. We show in Fig. 5(c) the distribution of cosT \u03b8W b , the cosine of\nthe angle in the transverse plane between the W and the nearer of the two b-jets. Due to the large\nboost of the top quark from the W \u2032 decay for the signal, the opening angle obviously is rather small\nas seen by the solid curve. In Fig. 5(d), we show the distribution of the full transverse mass of the\nW bb\u0304 system. It is encouraging to see a possible separation of the signal from the backgrounds.\nSince there is only one missing neutrino, the kinematical variables can be fully reconstructed\n14\n\n\f0.1\n0.01\n\n2 TeV\nSM t\n\u2212\nWbb\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nDiff. c.s.

Also shown are the irreducible backgrounds,\nthe SM single top tb\u0304 and W bb\u0304.\n\n15\n\n\fin the event as discussed earlier by demanding the mass reconstruction of MW , mt . Alternatively,\nsince the W is produced with a large boost, the neutrino will be considerably collimated with\nthe charged-lepton. If one makes the assumption3 p~\u03bd \u2248 \u03ba~\npl , the neutrino 4-momentum can be\napproximately determined and the full MW bb\u0304 can be formed. We find that doing so gives a narrower\n\nsignal invariant-mass peak, but also raises the background in the region of interest, resulting in a\nmarginal improvement in significance; we therefore do not pursue either of these ideas here.\nThe distributions in Fig. 5 motivate us to consider the following cuts:\nMT W b cut: 100 < MT W b < 190 GeV, since we expect for the signal this should reconstruct to the\nparent mtop , as can be seen in Fig. 5(b). Notice that since for single top this also reconstructs to\nMtop , this variable does not discriminate between the signal and this source of background.\nW b angle cut: cosT \u03b8W b > 0.5, motivated from (c), where we see that for the signal, the W b opening\nangle is fairly small owing to the large boost of the parent top.\n2 b-tags: We demand that there be two tagged b's in the event. We adopt a b-tagging efficiency\n\u03b7b = 0.4 [44]. With b-tagging parameters optimized for low pT b the light-quark rejection ratio (for\nj = u, d, s, g) is roughly Rj = 20 [44], where 1/Rj is the probability of mistaking a light-jet for\na b-jet. We believe this is likely to be improved with tagging techniques optimized for high pT b ,\nand since our light-quark jet background is significant, we anticipate such improvements and use\nRj = 40. We use a charm quark rejection factor Rc = 5.\nMT W bB cut: 1500 < MT W bb\u0304 < 2500 GeV (for MW \u2032 = 2 TeV), and, 2400 < MT W bb\u0304 < 3600 GeV\n(for MW \u2032 = 3 TeV), which is motivated by the resonant feature of the signal as seen clearly in (d),\nand results in the background being very effectively suppressed after this cut.\nJet-mass cut: tt\u0304 production can become a source of background since a top can fake a b-jet, for\ninstance when the hadronic decay products of a boosted top are sufficiently collimated that it can\nbe confused for a b-jet. The two main sources of a top pair are the SM QCD production, and the\nKK-gluon production which dominantly decays to this channel. Both can be significantly larger\nthan the signal, and the latter is especially problematic since it is resonant in the same invariant\nmass region as the signal. However, the jet-mass variable can be used to discriminate between a\nb-jet and a boosted hadronic top, with the distributions expected to peak at mb and mt respectively.\nIn order to obtain a rough estimate of the separation achievable, we have used Pythia v6.411 [45]\nto shower a bottom and a hadronically decayed top, followed by smearing the daughter particles\n\u221a\nenergy by 80 %/ E, and \u03b7 and \u03c6 by 0.05 to mimic the finite resolutions of the detector.4 In\ngeneral, a larger cone-size will include more of the radiation and results in a narrower distribution\nfor t-jets but at the expense of moving the b-jet peak to larger values. Also, since a b-jet is expected\nE\n/\nPractically, pT (\u03bd) = E\n/ T , pL (\u03bd) = pL (l) \u00d7 pT T(l) .\nWe are grateful to Frank Paige for many discussions on jet-mass issues. This variable was also explored in\nRef. [13] for the jet-mass of the W . Related issues, including using sub-structure of jets to reduce QCD backgrounds,\nhave also been discussed in Refs.[9, 40, 41, 46].\n3\n\n4\n\n16\n\n\fJet Mass : ConSiz=1.0, VetoFrac=0.2 : 2 TeV\n\nJet Mass : ConSiz=0.4, VetoFrac=0.2 : 3 TeV\n\n0.018\n\n0.014\nb-jet\nt-jet\n\n0.016\n\nb-jet\nt-jet\n\n0.012\n\n0.014\n0.01\n\n0.012\n0.01\n\n0.008\n\n0.008\n\n0.006\n\n0.006\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n0.002\n\n0.002\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n150\nJet Mass (GeV)\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n150\nJet Mass (GeV)\n\n200\n\n250\n\nFigure 6: The jet-mass distributions for top and bottom jets. These are after basic, W b and\ninvariant-mass cuts. On the left is for 2 TeV with cone-size 1.0, and, on the right for 3 TeV with\ncone-size 0.4. Both are with veto-fraction of 0.2.\n\nto be more collimated than a t-jet, we also demand that 80% of the pT be contained within the\ncone (veto-fraction of 0.2). We show in Fig. 6 the resulting jet-mass distributions for the 2 TeV\n(left) and 3 TeV (right) cases. For the 2 TeV case, we find a cone-size of 1.0 to result in adequate\nseparation, and a jet-mass cut Mj < 75 GeV with a veto-fraction of 0.2 retains 46% of b-jets and\n0.38% of t-jets. For the 3 TeV case, the decay products are more collimated and we therefore pick\na smaller cone-size, namely 0.4, and again with a veto-fraction of 0.2. We find that, with the cut\nMj < 100 GeV (larger than the previous case in order to keep more of the already small signal\nevents), 57% of b-jets and 2.5% of t-jets are retained.\nIn Table 1 we present the signal and background cross-sections (in fb) for the process pp \u2192\n\nW bb\u0304 \u2192 l\u03bdbb\u0304 for case (i). We include in the signal both W \u2032 + and W \u2032 \u2212 , and we find that the\n\nlatter cross-section is about a third of the former, stemming from the difference in the PDF's of\n\nmore u quarks than d quarks in a proton. We count for both l = e, \u03bc. Due to the large boost\nof the parent top, the lepton may not have a large isolation with respect to the b-jet, but we will\nassume that this will not result in too large a loss of efficiency. Ways to deal with this has been\ndiscussed in Refs.[8, 40]. The entry labeled as \"SM top\", in addition to the SM W \u00b1 -exchange\nsingle-top process, also includes the W -glue fusion process containing an extra jet that we use\nto veto events with pT j > 20 GeV in the central region. In the last two columns we show the\nsignificance without and with tt\u0304 as a source of background, with the significance including the\nlatter shown in parenthesis. The G(1) (KK gluon) is taken to be degenerate with W \u2032 . From the\ntable we see that we need L = 100 fb\u22121 (L = 300 fb\u22121 ) for a 2 TeV (3 TeV) W \u2032 , where we have\n\u221a\nestimated the signal significance by S/ B in Gaussian distribution for large event sample, but by\nConfidence Level (CL) in Poisson statistics for small even sample. Although the S/B is good for\nheavier masses, the signal will still be limited by statistics.\n17\n\n\fTable 1: The cross-sections (in fb) for the signal process pp \u2192 W \u2032 \u2192 tb \u2192 W b\u0304b \u2192 l\u03bd b\u0304b for case\n(i), and SM background, with the cuts applied successively.

Rather than repeating, in Table 2 we have combined, in SM W j1 j2 ,\nthe SM W bb\u0304, W bj, W cj and W jj channels shown separately in Table 1. Compared to case (i),\n\nas expected, the cross-section is lower in case (ii) since the tL , bL profiles are not peaked near the\nTeV brane (and hence do not have as large coupling to W \u2032 ) as in the former case, but rather it\nis the tR which either does not couple to W \u2032 if it is an SU (2)R singlet, or would couple to it only\nassociated with an exotic fermion if it is a triplet. We find that we need a much higher luminosity,\nnamely, 1000 fb\u22121 for a 2 TeV W \u2032 . In this case, we expect the other channels (to be discussed in\nthe following) to have better reach.\n\n4.2\n\nZW final state\n\nAs for the process\npp \u2192 W \u2032 \u2192 ZW,\n\n(7)\n\nwe consider the gauge boson decay modes separately. In order to effectively reconstruct the final\nstate, we do not pursue the missing decay channel Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd. Although simultaneous hadronic decays\n\nof Z and W have the largest branching fraction, the multiple jet background from QCD would be\noverwhelming. We therefore do not pursue this mode in our study.\nSince there is at most one missing neutrino in the final state, we can reconstruct the event if\none makes the assumption ~\np\u03bd \u2248 \u03ba~\npe (see the discussions in the last section). On the other hand, it\n\nis more straightforward to construct the events in the transverse plane.

Since Mh is unknown, we will take two representative cases: Mh = 120 GeV\nand 150 GeV. In the former case the dominant decay mode of the h will be to bb\u0304, while in the\nlatter, to W + W \u2212 . We will consider each of these cases in turn.\nWe would like to note that we do not consider the studies here as the Higgs boson discovery\nchannels. Instead, we should consider them as case studies for illustration since we should have\nhad the knowledge about the Higgs properties when our proposed searches are undertaken at the\nLHC.\n4.3.1\n\nMh = 120 GeV: h \u2192 bb\u0304, W \u2192 l\u03bd\n\nFor this case with a relatively low mass, we estimate that BR(h \u2192 bb\u0304) \u2248 0.7.

Doing so would improve\nthe significance over that shown here.\nIn Table 6 we show the cross-sections as we apply the above cuts successively.

We will refer to the merged jet closer to the leptonic W as the near-jet jN and the\nmerged jet on the other side as the far-jet jF .\nWe require that there be a jet close to the lepton with \u2206ljN < 0.9, and require MT W jN to\nbe around Mh , which will reduce the W + 2j background. In addition to the irreducible SM W h\nbackground, SM h+1j also remains as a background, which we will include.

So, we expect similar signals for the two scenarios and therefore it is useful to compare the\nextensive technicolor studies in the literature (see Ref. [47] for a review) with our current work on\nsignals for electroweak KK gauge bosons in warped extra dimension (including neutral case studied\nearlier in Ref. [13]).\nWe begin with the details of this duality which will enable us to compare the signals that\nwe studied to technicolor studies. The 5D model corresponds to a 4D theory with two sectors5 .\nThere is a sector which is strongly coupled, with the strength of the couplings in this sector\nremaining approximately constant over the Planck-weak hierarchy, i.e., it is a quasi-conformal\ntheory. Conformal invariance is broken at the TeV scale, resulting in a tower of composite (bound)\nstates starting at \u223c TeV scale. The 2nd sector consists of particles external to this conformal sector\n\nor elementary (as opposed to the composites of the strong sector above). However, these 2 sectors\nare not isolated, i.e., they do couple to each other. As a result, the elementary particles (external\nto the CFT sector) mix with the CFT composites and the mass eigenstates (physical states) are\nadmixtures of the two sets of particles. These physical states correspond to the zero and KK modes\nof the 5D theory.\nFurthermore, the location of a mode in the extra dimension is dual to the amount or degree\n\nof compositeness (in the sense of the elementary-composite mixture above) of the corresponding\nstate in the 4D theory. Specifically, modes which are localized near the Planck (TeV) brane are\ninterpreted as states which are mostly elementary (composite). Thus, the light SM fermions are\nmostly elementary, whereas the top quark, Higgs (including unphysical Higgs or longitudinal W/Z)\n5\n\nSee reference [29] for a two-site description of the 5D model (including the couplings to the heavy new particles)\nalong these lines.\n\n26\n\n\fand all KK's are mostly composites (the SM gauge bosons with a flat profile are in-between in\nterms of compositeness). Roughly speaking, the KK tower of the 5D theory then corresponds to\nthe tower of (massive) composites (\"hadrons\") in the 4D theory. As discussed earlier, the coupling\nof a set of modes of the 5D theory is proportional to the overlap of the corresponding profiles in the\nextra dimension, i.e., it is large if all the modes of this set are localized near the TeV (or Planck)\nbrane and small if some modes are localized near the Planck brane while others are localized near\nTeV brane. In the dual 4D theory, the 1st situation correspond to all the particles of the set\nbeing mostly composite (or mostly elementary), clearly resulting in a large coupling between these\nparticles, while the 2nd situation involves some particles which are mostly elementary and others\nwhich are mostly composites (thus accounting for the small coupling).\nWe now compare the nature of couplings and hence the decay channels in the warped extra\ndimensional model that we studied to the case of technicolor theories studied previously. First of\nall, the decays to physical Higgs bosons (+W/Z) for the electroweak KK's that we studied are\nnew compared to technicolor studies. The reason is that in technicolor theories (at least in the\nminimal models), there would not be a light Higgs since the idea of technicolor models is that the\nstrong dynamics directly or spontaneously breaks EW symmetry. Equivalently, W W scattering\nis unitarized by exchange of spin-1 bound states (techni-\u03c1's) instead of by a (light) Higgs. On\nthe other hand the warped extra dimensional model that we studied (with a light Higgs in the\nspectrum) is dual to composite Higgs models in 4D, i.e., where strong dynamics does not directly\nbreak EW symmetry. Rather, the strong dynamics produces a light composite Higgs which then\nacquires a vev in the low energy theory to break EW symmetry.\nHowever, the decays of electroweak KK's to W Z or W W and production of KK's in vector\nboson fusion are (qualitatively) similar to those studied in the technicolor literature for the following\nreason. Recall that the decays of electroweak KK's to W Z and W W are dominated by longitudinal\npolarizations of the latter, that too with couplings which are enhanced relative to the SM. Since\nlongitudinal W/Z are equivalent to unphysical Higgs, it is clear (based on the above discussion) that\nthis coupling is dual to a self-coupling of three composites (techni-\u03c1 with composite Goldstones) in\nthe 4D theory and thus is expected to be large. Clearly, such a coupling is a general characteristic\nof EWSB originating from strong dynamics and is present in all technicolor models studied in the\nliterature. Of course, the details of these couplings at the quantitative level will be different in the\n5D model than in the technicolor case (see Ref. [48] for a model-independent parametrization of\ncouplings in composite Higgs models).\nFor the case of couplings of gauge KK's to fermions, it is convenient to consider two pieces or\ncontributions in the formula for this coupling (see Table 10) as follows. It can be shown that the\npiece \u221d 1/\u03be comes from overlap of profiles near the Planck or UV brane. This part of the coupling\nis dual to the SM fermion first coupling to the photon/W /Z (external to strong dynamics) which\n\n27\n\n\fthen mixes with the composite techni-\u03c1 (analog of photon-\u03c1 mixing in QCD). Clearly, this piece of\nthe coupling is present in technicolor models studied in the literature as well and is flavor universal.\nThe contribution to the coupling of SM fermions to gauge KK's \u221d \u03be originates from the overlap\n\nof profiles near the TeV or IR brane. In the 4D theory, this part of the coupling corresponds to a\ndirect coupling of SM fermions to the techni-\u03c1, i.e., a coupling involving the composite component of\nthe techni-\u03c1 (as opposed to the coupling via techni-\u03c1's mixing with external gauge bosons). Clearly\nsuch a contribution arises from (partial) compositeness of the SM fermions themselves and is of\nsimilar size to the fermions' coupling to the Higgs (which is another composite). Thus, this piece\nof the coupling is \u221d 4D or SM Yukawa coupling and is therefore flavor-dependent.\n\nThis second contribution to the SM fermion coupling to KK's is absent in \"extended technicolor\"\n\n(ETC), which is the mechanism used in traditional technicolor models to generate fermion masses\n(instead of partial compositeness of SM fermions as described above). In detail, in ETC, the SM\nfermion masses originate from the coupling of two SM fermions to (a scalar operator of) strong\ndynamics such that there is no mixing of external fermions with composite fermions, unlike in\nthe partial compositeness case which involves coupling of a single external fermion to (a fermionic\noperator of) strong dynamics. In any case, this piece of the coupling is irrelevant for production\nof gauge KK's via Drell-Yan (DY) process since that involves (dominantly) light fermions, whereas\nit is relevant for decays of gauge KK's into heavier SM fermions (top/bottom). Therefore, DY\nproduction of gauge KK's is (at least qualitatively) similar to that of techni-\u03c1's in technicolor,\nwhereas decays to top quarks are different than in the simplest technicolor models with ETC.\nIn general, using the warped extra dimension framework has the advantage that we have a\nconcrete, weakly coupled model so that we can ensure that we have a consistent set of couplings.\nIn contrast, most technicolor studies simply used a parametrization for the various couplings rather\nthan a well-defined model, although one could conceivably have such a model for these couplings\nby rescaling QCD data, assuming the strong dynamics is QCD-like.\nOther differences between our analyses and earlier studies of technicolor are as follows. Most of\nthe technicolor studies did not go beyond \u223c 2.5 TeV mass for the techni-\u03c1's, although the heavier\n\nend of the mass range was preferred by constraints from EWPT (specifically the S parameter),\nwhile we have considered signals for electroweak KK's up to 3 TeV. Finally, the semileptonic decay\nof the W W or W Z has not been studied in detail in the technicolor context, especially the use of\njet mass cut to discriminate a W/Z jet from a QCD jet.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nIn the past few years, it has been shown that the framework of a warped extra dimension with\nSM fields in the bulk can address many of the puzzles of nature. Thus, this framework is a very\nattractive extension of the SM (perhaps as compelling as SUSY). As the LHC has started, it is\n28\n\n\fTable 9: Summary of the best channel for each of the W \u2032 decay modes, giving the luminosity and\nsignificance for the mass shown, in the two tR coupling scenarios of Case (i) and (ii).

(23), extracting from the detailed analysis we presented\nin Sec. 4 the best channel for each of the W \u2032 decay modes. We give the luminosity and resulting\nsignificance for the mass shown. We find that we can get a sensitivity of 2 (3) TeV masses with an\nintegrated luminosity of about 100 (300) fb\u22121 , which although slightly better is comparable to the\nKK Z reach obtained in Ref. [13].\nIt is instructive to compare our analysis to the previous ones, starting with various spin-1 states,\nin order to illustrate the complementarity of the various studies. The KK gluon has the largest\ncross-section in this framework, but it decays mostly into tt\u0304 which results in exclusively jetty final\nstates, even if the W from the top decays to leptons (due to the high degree of collimation of decay\nproducts of the top quarks). On the other hand, KK W decays into W Z can result in clean, purely\nleptonic and fully reconstructible final states, albeit with a small BR which in the end does not\nresult in the reach being larger in this channel.6 In contrast, KK Z decays into W W can also\nresult in purely leptonic final states, but the invariant mass is not reconstructible in this case. The\n6\nIn more detail, the ability\n\u221a to reconstruct the W Z invariant mass makes the S/B larger, but the effect is diluted\na bit when we\nin S/B, but still tends\n\u221aconsider S/ B. The effect of a smaller BR of W Z vs. W W to leptons cancels \u221a\nto reduce S/ B. So, the net result is a significantly larger S/B for the former case, but S/ B is not larger by as\nmuch. Another issue is that the KK W can decay into one KK and one zero-mode fermion in the set-ups that we\nconsidered (with decays to two light KK fermions being kinematically forbidden in the cases that we study). The\npresence of this channel dilutes the BR to W Z for the KK W . Such a decay channel is suppressed for the KK Z\nsince the light KK fermion comes from a different 5D fermion field than the zero-mode fermion and thus U (1) gauge\nbosons (including U (1) subgroups of non-abelian gauge multiplets) such as the Z cannot couple these two fermions.\n\n29\n\n\fsemileptonic analogues of these decays for KK W/Z (i.e., one W/Z decaying leptonically and the\nother hadronically) are on a similar footing to KK gluon in terms of cleanness since the detection\nof the highly collimated hadronically decaying W/Z requires discriminating it from the QCD jet\nbackground (just like for highly collimated top quarks from decays of the KK gluon): in our analysis\na jet mass cut was used for this purpose. Finally, KK Z decays to top pairs are swamped by KK\ngluon background7 , but KK W decays to tb\u0304 do not have this problem if the background from KK\ngluon to tt\u0304 with one highly boosted top faking a bottom can be reduced, for example again by\nusing jet mass as we did here.\nWe reiterate that further development of techniques for detecting highly boosted W/Z jets and\nsimilarly vetoing a highly boosted top faking a bottom can improve the reach for charged (and\nalso neutral) EW states. Another feature we would like to mention is that there are two extreme\npossibilities for the profiles of top/bottom quarks which are relevant for the KK W search, namely,\nwhere the RH or LH top is localized near the so called TeV brane in the extra dimension (while\nthe other chirality has close-to-flat profile) \u2013 the point is that either tR or tL must be localized\nnear the TeV brane in order to obtain the large top mass. The first possibility is favored by flavor\nprecision tests, whereas EW precision tests have a milder preference for the second. Note that the\nKK modes are also localized near the TeV brane. Hence, the coupling of the KK W (and hence the\nBR) to LH t (and b\u0304)8 is suppressed or enhanced in the two cases and thus vice versa for BR of the\nother channels with significant couplings to the KK W , i.e., W Z and W h, making the two search\nchannels (i.e., tb\u0304 and W Z/h) complementary in the case of the KK W . These two choices for top\nprofiles make less of a difference for the KK Z search since the KK Z always has substantial BR\nto decay into SM top pairs (of whichever chirality \u2013 LH or RH \u2013 is localized near the TeV brane).\nFor a complete perspective of this research program, we now comment on the other spin states.\nThe spin-2 KK graviton is typically heavier than the spin-1 states and thus has an even smaller\nproduction cross-section. Its decays to tt\u0304 are not likely to be swamped by those of the KK gluon due\nto the different mass, but one faces the (even more difficult) challenge of identifying highly boosted\ntop quarks. Decays to ZZ followed by leptons are possibly the cleanest and can moreover be fully\nreconstructed, but suffer from a very small BR. In contrast, decays to W W cannot be reconstructed\nin the fully leptonic case (just like in the case of KK Z) and challenges for the semileptonic case\nare similar to KK W/Z from QCD background.\nAs far as KK fermions are concerned, the masses of the KK excitations of top/bottom (and their\nother gauge-group partners) in some models (where the 5D gauge symmetry is extended beyond\nthat in the SM) can be (much) smaller than gauge KK modes, enhancing the prospect for their\ndiscovery. In fact, the other heavier (spin-1 or 2) KK modes can decay into these light KK fermions,\n7\nassuming a small mass splitting between the KK Z and the KK gluon as in the simplest models with no branelocalized kinetic terms for bulk gauge fields\n8\nThe decays of KK W to tR and bR are usually suppressed since bR is localized near the Planck brane.\n\n30\n\n\fresulting in perhaps more distinctive final states for the heavy KK's than the pairs of W/Z or top\nquarks that have been studied so far \u2013 for a recent such study for KK gluon, see Ref. [11]. A few\nstudies of signals for the heavier KK fermions and of the radion have also been done. We leave\nmore detailed studies of heavier KK fermions and radion (as well as the rather model-dependent\ndecays of heavier KK Z/W /graviton into lighter KK's or radion) for future work.\nWe would like to emphasize that the signals we studied in this paper (and the previous one on\nneutral gauge bosons) might actually be valid for a wider class of non-supersymmetric models of\nEWSB. For example, based on AdS/CFT correspondence discussed in Sec. 5, it is clear that any\nkind of 4D strong dynamics involved in EWSB will (in general) share many of the features of the 5D\nmodel. Also, the parameter space of little Higgs models which satisfies EWPT corresponds to the\nW \u2032 , Z \u2032 being weakly coupled to light fermions and strongly coupled to Higgs (including longitudinal\nW/Z) [49], just like in the 5D models we studied here. Moreover, some UV completions of little\nHiggs involve 4D strong dynamics which might have a dual warped extra dimensional description.\nThus, little Higgs models and EWSB models with strong dynamics are likely to have LHC signals\nsimilar to the ones we have studied. Note however that the flavor structure of the warped extra\ndimension is different than in traditional technicolor models so that the decays of KK W/Z to\ntop/bottom are new features. We would also like to point out that the jet mass cut for semileptonic\ndecays of W Z or W W from decay of heavy W/Z has not been studied in detail in these other\ncontexts (technicolor or little Higgs).\nIn more generality, the point is that there is a class of non-supersymmetric extensions of the\nSM without a symmetry (analogous to R-parity in SUSY) which allow tree-level exchange of new\nparticles to contribute to (purely) SM operators, resulting in strong constraints from precision tests,\ntypically a few TeV mass for the new particles. Moreover, in many such models, the top/bottom\nquark and Higgs, including the longitudinal W/Z, couple strongly to the new particles since all\nthese particles are closely associated with EWSB. On the other hand, the coupling of the new states\nto light fermions is typically weak, in part based on considerations of flavor and EW precision\ntests. Thus, a large class of non-supersymmetric models faces challenges similar to the warped\nextra dimension framework that we studied here, namely, production of the new states tends to\nbe suppressed and decays are mostly to top quarks/W /Z, that too highly boosted. In summary,\nthe techniques we developed in this paper might be useful for obtaining signals for a wider class of\nmodels, beyond warped extra dimensions.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank H.

[13], EWSB induces a mixing between Z (0) \u2194 Z1 (with\n\nmixing angle \u03b801 ) and Z (0) \u2194 ZX 1 (with mixing angle \u03b801X ).

The extra SU (2)R (relative to the SM) ensures suppression\nof contribution to the EWPT (specifically an observable called the T parameter). Hence, we obtain\n2 charged KK towers (before EWSB) \u2013 one from each SU (2) group in the bulk. We will restrict\nto the 1st KK modes only in each tower and denote them by WL1 and WR1 , respectively. EWSB\nmixes the 2 and the resulting mass eigenstates are denoted by W\u0303R1 and W\u0303L1 .\n2\nWe work in the approximation (k\u03c0rc ) m2W /MKK\n\u226a 1.\n\nB.1\n\nW \u2032 coupling to fermions\n\nWe show below the fermion representations under SU (2)L \u2297 SU (2)R \u2297 U (1)X , denoted as (L, R)X .\n\nWe take the left handed quarks of the first and second generation, and the left-handed leptons to be\ndoublets under SU (2)L . This specifies the interaction of these fields with WL1 . The WR1 couplings\nto first and second generation quarks, right-handed bottom quark and leptons are negligibly small\nsince the WR1 profile is suppressed near the Planck brane where these fermion fields are peaked.\nTo have the custodial symmetry protection of the Zbb\u0304 coupling [37], we take the third generation\nleft-handed quarks to be in the representation\n\u0001\nQ3L = qL3 qL\u2032 3 =\n\n\u0012\n\ntL \u03c7L\nbL TL\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2192 (2, 2)2/3 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c7L , TL are taken to have (\u2212+) boundary conditions (BC) with no zero-modes9 . We have\nQ(\u03c7L ) = 5/3 and Q(TL ) = 2/3. To accommodate the large top and bottom mass difference we\ntake it that tR and bR do not belong to the same SU (2)R multiplet.

For Case (i), tR \u2192 (1, 1), the electroweak precision tests (EWPT) are\nbetter satisfied [38] for cQ3 = 0 and ctR = 0.4, i.e., Q3L peaked closer to the TeV brane, while for\nL\n\nCase (ii), tR \u2192 (1, 3), for cQ3 = 0.4 and ctR = 0, i.e., ctR peaked closer to the TeV brane. After\nL\n\nincluding the charges and the overlap integrals, the largest effective coupling of third generation\n\nfermions to gauge KK modes in Case (i) would be to Q3L , being larger than that in Case (ii), which\nwould be to tR . Consequently, while on the one hand new gauge KK induced FCNC contributions\nwould be larger in Case (i) and hence more problematic for the simplest constructions, on the other\nhand collider signals would be larger compared to Case (ii).\nThe fermion couplings to W \u2032 depend on various mixing angles summarized in App. A. The\ncouplings also depend on the overlap integrals which we give next. We note that WL1 has (++)\nwhile WR1 has (\u2212+) BC. The overlap integrals of a W \u2032 with two fermions are given in Table 10.\nxx\nWe represent by Iyy,zz\nthe overlap integral of the W \u2032 having xx BC with two fermion fields one\n++\nis the overlap integral of the WL1 with\nwith yy and the other with zz BC's.

Similarly, Iyy,zz\n++\n= 0 etc., and we show\nWR1 with two fermions. Due to the orbifold Z2 symmetry, we have I++,\u2212+\n\nonly the nonzero ones in the table.\nWe note that the mass of the (\u2212+) fermion is lighter than MW\u0303L for c < 1/2. In particular for\n1\n\nc = 0.4 it is about 0.9MW\u0303L , and for c = 0 it is about 0.6MW\u0303L .
