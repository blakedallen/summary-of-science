As to the\nneutron EDM, the best upper limit on it was obtained as a result of reactor experiments lasting\nmany years [4] (they say that the searches for the neutron EDM killed more theories than any\nother experiment in the history of physics). And at last, the result for the muon EDM follows\nfrom the measurements at the dedicated muon storage ring [5]. These results are summarized\nin Table 1.\n\nd/e, cm\n\ne\n\np\n\nn\n\n\u03bc\n\n(0.7 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u221227 [1]\n\n< 0.8 \u00d7 10\u221224 [2, 3]\n\n< 0.29 \u00d7 10\u221225 [4]\n\n(0.37 \u00b1 0.34) \u00d7 10\u221218 [5]\n\nTable 1\n\nAs to the dipole moments of the \u03c4 -lepton and heavy quarks, upper limits on them have\nbeen obtained up to now from the analysis of high-energy experiments.\nThe approach pursued here is based on the precision results [1, 4]. We establish upper limits\non the dipole moments of the \u03c4 -lepton and heavy quarks through the analysis of their possible\ncontributions to the electron EDM. This is a clean theoretical problem for the \u03c4 -lepton. For\nheavy quarks and W -boson these our results are of rather qualitative nature. Additional upper\nlimits on the dipole moments of heavy quarks, and W -boson, also qualitative ones, are derived\nby the analysis of their possible contributions to the neutron EDM.\n1\n\nA.G.Grozin@inp.nsk.su\nkhriplovich@inp.nsk.su\n3\nsaber @inbox.ru\n2\n\n\f2\n\nDipole moment of \u03c4 -lepton and electron EDM\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nFigure 1\nWe start with the analysis of the contribution of the \u03c4 EDM d\u03c4 to the electron dipole\nmoment de . This contribution is described by the diagrams of the type presented in Figs.\n1a,b,c,d. Here the loop is formed by the \u03c4 line, and the lower solid line is the electron one.\nThe upper wavy line corresponds to the external electric field. The crossed vertices refer to the\nelectromagnetic interaction of the \u03c4 EDM\nLedm\n= \u2212\n\u03c4\n\n1\n1\nd\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03b3 5 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 F\u03bc\u03bd = i d\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ;\n2\n2\n\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b1\u03b2 .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nOf course, all six permutations of the electromagnetic vertices on the electron line should be\nconsidered. The contributions of diagrams 1b and 1c are equal.\nThis problem is similar to that of the contribution by the light-by-light scattering via muon\nloop to the electron magnetic moment [6]. The general structure of the resulting contribution\nto the electron EDM is rather obvious (to the leading order in me /m\u03c4 ):\nme \u0010 \u03b1 \u00113\n\u2206de = a\nd\u03c4 ,\n(2)\nm\u03c4 \u03c0\nwhere a is some numerical factor (hopefully, on the order of unity). The factor me originates\nfrom the necessary helicity-flip on the electron line; then 1/m\u03c4 is dictated by dimensional\narguments.\nDiagram 1a corresponds to the matrix element <e|\u03c4\u0304 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 |e> = C \u016b\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd u. We use dimensional\nregularization with d = 4 \u2212 2\u03b5 dimensions and the method of regions (see the textbook [7]).\nOnly the region where all three loops are hard (loop momenta \u223c m\u03c4 ) contributes to the leading\npower term (2); therefore, there are no logarithms ln(m\u03c4 /me ) (contributions of regions with 1\nor 2 hard loops are suppressed by an extra factor (me /m\u03c4 )2 ). In this hard region, the problem\nreduces to 3-loop vacuum integrals with a single mass m\u03c4 belonging to the simpler topology\nBM [8]. We perform the calculation in arbitrary covariant gauge, and use the Reduce package\nRecursor [8] to reduce scalar integrals to two master integrals. Gauge-dependent terms\ncancel, and we get\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b5\n2d2 \u2212 21d + 61 d4 \u2212 9d3 + 8d2 + 84d \u2212 126\n8\nme e6 m\u22126\n\u03c4\n3\n\u22122\n\u0393 (\u03b5)\n+\nR ,\nC=\nm\u03c4 (4\u03c0)3d/2\nd(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 5)\nd\u22125\n2d \u2212 9\n(3)\nwhere\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03932 (1 + 2\u03b5)\u0393(1 + 3\u03b5)\n= 1 + 8\u03b6(3)\u03b53 + * * * ,\n(4)\nR=\n\u03932 (1 + \u03b5)\u0393(1 + 4\u03b5)\n\n\fand \u03b6 is the Riemann \u03b6-function. All divergences cancel, and we arrive at the finite contribution\nto a:\n19\n3\n.\n(5)\na1 = \u03b6(3) \u2212\n2\n12\nIn order to calculate the contribution of Fig. 1b,c,d, we expand the corresponding initial\nexpressions in the external photon momentum q up to the linear term. The EDM vertex\ncontains \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ; we put this factor aside, and calculate tensor diagrams with four indices. After\nsumming all diagrams, the result is finite; now we can set \u03b5 \u2192 0, and multiply by \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (cf. [9]).\nThe result has the structure of a tree diagram with the electron EDM vertex \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 q\u03bd \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 . The\ngauge-dependent terms in it cancel (exactly in d), as well as the divergences. This contribution\nto a is\n9\na2 = \u03b6(3) \u2212 1 .\n(6)\n4\nAs an additional check of our programs, we have reproduced the leading power term in the\ncontribution to the electron magnetic moment originating from the light-by-light scattering via\nthe muon loop (formula (4) in [6]).\nThe final result for the numerical coefficient is\na = a1 + a2 =\n\n15\n31\n\u03b6(3) \u2212\n= 1.924 .\n4\n12\n\n(7)\n\nWith this value of a, the discussed contribution to the electron EDM is\n\u2206de = 6.9 \u00d7 10\u221212 d\u03c4 .\n\n(8)\n\nCombining this result with the experimental one [1] (see Table 1) for the electron EDM, we\narrive at\nd\u03c4 /e = (1 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10\u221216 cm .\n(9)\nIn fact, the results (5) and (6) refer to somewhat different regions of incoming momenta.\nFor (6) all the three momenta are hard, on the order of magnitude about m\u03c4 , but for (5) only\ntwo of them belong to this region, and the third one, that of the outer photon, is soft, of\nvanishing momentum. Still, one may expect that the effective EDM interaction is formed at\nmomenta much higher than m\u03c4 , so that this difference is not of much importance. Besides, the\ncontribution of diagram 1a is anyway numerically small. Thus, result (5) is valid at least for\nall momenta about m\u03c4 \u223c 1 \u2013 2 GeV.\nThe upper limits on the \u03c4 EDM derived from the accelerator experiments [10, 11, 12, 13]\nbelong to the interval of 10\u221216 \u2212 10\u221217 e*cm, so that our result (9) formally does not improve\nthem. However, all those accelerator data refer to much larger typical momenta of the photon,\nfrom 10 to 200 GeV.\n\n3\n\nDipole moments of heavy quarks and electron EDM\n\nThe information on the dipole moments dq of heavy quarks can be obtained from the diagrams\nanalogous to those presented in Figures 1, but with quarks in the fermion loops, instead of\nthe \u03c4 -lepton. We do not consider the gluon corrections to the quark loops, and confine to the\nsimple estimate for them, following from the analogy between the two problems (see (2)):\n\u2206de = aq 3 Q3\n\nme \u0010 \u03b1 \u00113\ndq ;\nmq \u03c0\n\n(10)\n\n\fhere mq is the quark mass, Q is the quark charge in the units of e (Qb = \u22121/3, Qc,t = 2/3).\nAs to the overall numerical factor here, we put aq \u2243 1. The corresponding estimates are\nstraightforward. Here and below we assume the following values for the quark masses:\nmc = 1.25 GeV;\n\nmb = 4.5 GeV;\n\nmt = 175 GeV.\n\nThus obtained upper limits are:\ndc /e \u223c\n< 3 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm;\n\n4\n\ndb /e \u223c\n< 7 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm;\n\ndt /e \u223c\n< 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm .\n\n(11)\n\nDipole moments of heavy quarks and neutron EDM\n\nThe dipole moment of a heavy quark Q generates the EDM of a light quark q via the following\ndiagram [14]:\n\nFigure 2\nThe scattering amplitudes and corresponding contributions to the dipole moments of light\nquarks are:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\n\u039b2\n1\n2 mq mQ\n|VQq |\nM1 =\ndQ \u016b\u03b35 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd u F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(12)\nln 2 \u2212 2\n2\n2\nmW\nmW\n2\n16\u03c0 sin \u03b8w\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u039b2\n\u03b1\n2 mq mQ\nln 2 \u2212 2 dQ ,\n(13)\n\u2206dq =\n|VQq |\nm2W\nmW\n16\u03c0 sin2 \u03b8w\nfor\nQ = c, q = d or Q = b, q = u;\nand\n\n\u0013\n\u039b2\n1\nln 2 \u2212 2\ndt \u016b\u03b35 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd u F\u03bc\u03bd ,\nmt\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u039b2\n\u03b1\n2 mt md\nln 2 \u2212 2 dt ,\n\u2206dd =\n|Vtd |\nm2W\nmt\n16\u03c0 sin2 \u03b8w\n\n\u03b1\nmt md\nM2 =\n|Vtd |2\n2\nm2W\n16\u03c0 sin \u03b8w\n\n\u0012\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nfor\nQ = t, q = d.\nHere VQq are the corresponding coefficients of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix; \u03b8w is the Weinberg angle, sin2 \u03b8w = 0.23. The structures of relations (13) and (15) are different since\nmc, b \u226a mW , while mt > mW . In fact, to simplify final expressions, we confine to the leading\norder in 1/m2W in (12), (13), and even assume that mt \u226b mW in (14), (15). In both cases\n\n\fthe diagrams are logarithmically divergent, so that we have to introduce a cut-off \u039b at high\nmomenta.\nThis divergence is caused by the term k\u03bc k\u03bd /m2W in the numerator of the W Green function\n\u2212\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd + k\u03bc k\u03bd /m2W\n.\nk 2 \u2212 m2W\nThe mentioned term k\u03bc k\u03bd /m2W was omitted in [14]. Therefore, relations (13) and (15) differ\nessentially from the corresponding results of [14].\nIn our estimates here, we assume that both ln(\u039b2 /m2W ) \u2212 2 and ln(\u039b2 /m2t ) \u2212 2 are on the\norder of unity. As to the light quark dipole moments, we assume (in the spirit of the constituent\nquark model) that they are on the same order of magnitude as the neutron EDM:\ndu, d \u223c dn .\nOf course, both these assumptions make the corresponding estimates less definite than those\nbased on electron EDM. The results of our estimates are presented in the last line of Table 2.\nIn its previous line we repeat for comparison the data already given in (11). In both sets of\nestimates the strong interaction of quarks is neglected.\nc\n\nb\n\nt\n\nmQ , GeV\n\n1.25\n\n4.5\n\n175\n\ndQ /e, cm\nderived with de\n\n< 3 \u00d7 10\u221216\n\u223c\n\n< 7 \u00d7 10\u221215\n\u223c\n\n< 4 \u00d7 10\u221214\n\u223c\n\ndQ /e, cm\nderived with dn\n\n< 10\u221215\n\u223c\n\n< 2 \u00d7 10\u221212\n\u223c\n\n< 5 \u00d7 10\u221215\n\u223c\n\nTable 2. Limits on quark dipole moments from electron and neutron EDMs\nIt is only natural that for the most heavy t-quark the bound from dn dominates.\nThe bounds on the dipole moments of c- and b-quarks derived from the high-energy experiments [13, 15] are on the order of 10\u221217 e*cm, so that they are more strict than the limits given\nin Table 2. However, as noted above already, the high-energy data refer to different, much\nlarger typical momenta of the photon.\nIn conclusion of this section, we mention the investigation of the radiative decay b \u2192 s\u03b3 as a\nprobe of the t -quark EDM [16]. The discussed contribution to the decay amplitude is described\nby the diagram in Fig. 3. This diagram is also logarithmically divergent. Its contribution can\nbe easily obtained as follows. In the limit mb \u2192 ms , the structure of discussed matrix element\nshould coincide with that of (14) (up to the obvious changes md \u2192 mb(s) and |Vtd |2 \u2192 Vts\u2217 Vtb ).\nOn the other hand, in the limit ms \u2192 0, the outgoing s-quark should be left-handed. Therefore,\nthe matrix element of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 decay (with the internal t-quark) should look as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1\n\u039b2\nmt\n\u2217\nM(b \u2192 s\u03b3) =\nln 2 \u2212 2 dt \u016bs \u2212 mb (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) + ms (1 + \u03b35 ) \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ub F\u03bc\u03bd\nV Vtb\nmt\n64\u03c0 sin2 \u03b8w ts m2W\n\n\fFigure 3\n\n\u03b1\nmb mt\n\u2243\u2212\nVts\u2217 Vtb\n2\nm2W\n64\u03c0 sin \u03b8w\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u039b2\nln 2 \u2212 2 dt \u016bs (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ub F\u03bc\u03bd .\nmt\n\n(16)\n\nThe result presented in [16] is\ndt /e \u223c\n< 10\u221216 cm.\n\n5\n\n(17)\n\nElectric dipole moment of W -boson\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u00d7\nW\n\ne\n\nW\n\n\u03bd\n\ne\n\nFigure 4\nOne more contribution to the electron and neutron dipole moments can be given by the\nEDM dW of W -boson. This effect was pointed out and investigated long ago [17, 18].\nIt is convenient to start the discussion with the electron EDM. The effect is described by\ndiagram presented in Fig. 4. Here as well the crossed vertex refers to the electromagnetic\ninteraction of the W -boson EDM (it is obvious from the diagram that here it is the dipole\nmoment of W \u2212 ). In this case the EDM interaction is described by the Lagrangian\n\u2020\nLedm\nW = 2mW idW F\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 W\u03b1 W\u03b2 .\n\nThe corresponding matrix element is\nZ\n\u03c0\u03b1\nk\u0302\nd4 k\nM=\nd\nm\n\u016be (p)\u03b3\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) 2 \u03b3\u03bd (1 + \u03b3 5 )ue (p)\u00d7\nW\nW\n2\n4\n(2\u03c0)\nk\nsin \u03b8w\n\u001a\ni\u001b\n1 h\n1\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 (k \u2212 p)\u03bc (k \u2212 p)\u03b1 F\u0303\u03b1\u03bd + F\u0303\u03bc\u03b1 (k \u2212 p)\u03b1 (k \u2212 p)\u03bd .\n\u00d7\n[(k \u2212 p)2 \u2212 m2W ]2\nmW\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\n\fWith straightforward, though rather tedious calculations (somewhat simplified by employing\nthe density matrix of polarized fermion), one arrives at the following result for the contribution\nof W -boson EDM to electron dipole moment:\nme\n\u03b1\n\u039b2\n\u2206de =\nln 2 dW .\nmW\n8\u03c0 sin2 \u03b8w mW\n\n(20)\n\nHere \u039b is the cut-off parameter for the logarithmically divergent integral over virtual momenta\nin the loop. Putting (perhaps, quite conservatively) ln(\u039b2 /m2W ) \u2243 1, one obtains with the\nexperimental upper limit on the electron EDM [1] (see Table 1), the following bound on the\ndipole moment of W -boson:\ndW /e \u223c\n< 2 \u00d7 10\u221219 cm .\n(21)\nIn the case of the W -boson contribution to the neutron EDM, our line of reasoning somewhat\ndiffers from that of [17, 18]. We note first of all that the electron mass me does not enter\nexplicitly matrix element (19). It arises in the result (20) only as the mass of an external\nfermion, via the Dirac equation p\u0302 u = me u. Therefore, there are all the reasons to expect that\nthe contribution of dW to the neutron EDM will be proportional to the neutron mass mn , i.e.\nenhanced as compared to (20) by three orders of magnitude. In this case, the forward scattering\namplitude of the virtual W -boson can be written in a general form as follows4 :\nh\ni\n2\n2\n\u016bn (p)\u03b3\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) k\u0302 g(k ) + p\u0302 h(k ) \u03b3\u03bd (1 + \u03b3 5 )un (p) ;\n(22)\nhere k is the total momentum of intermediate hadronic states. Of course, the invariant functions\ng and h depend in fact not only on k 2 , but on (kp) as well. However, in our case k 2 \u223c m2W \u226b\n(kp) \u223c mn mW , so that the dependence on (kp) can be safely ignored. By the analogous\nreason, in the usual case of the deep inelastic neutrino scattering, the structure with p\u0302 in the\ncorresponding amplitude is also omitted. In the present case, however, we should keep in\namplitude (22) p\u0302, in addition to the common k\u0302, since after integrating over d4 k both structures\ngive comparable contributions to the result.\nAt last, the usual dimensional and scaling arguments dictate that asymptotically, for k 2 \u223c\nm2W , both functions g and h behave as follows:\ng(k 2) =\n\ng0\n,\nk2\n\nh(k 2 ) =\n\nh0\n.\nk2\n\nIn particular, one can neglect the gluon corrections in these functions. Without any additional\nparameters, it is natural to assume that g0 , h0 \u223c 1.\nNow, the same calculations as those in the case of electron EDM, result in the following\nexpression for the discussed contribution to the neutron dipole moment:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nmn\n\u039b2\n\u039b2\n\u03b1\ng0 ln 2 + h0 ln 2 + 1 dW .\n(23)\n\u2206dn =\nmW\nmW\n8\u03c0 sin2 \u03b8w mW\nFor numerical estimate we put\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u039b2\n\u039b2\ng0 ln 2 + h0 ln 2 + 1 \u223c 1 ,\nmW\nmW\nso that\n\u2206dn \u223c\n4\n\n\u03b1\nmn\n\u03b1 mn\ndW \u2248\ndW .\n2\n2\u03c0 mW\n8\u03c0 sin \u03b8w mW\n\nCompare with the corresponding structure \u016be (p)\u03b3\u03bc (1+\u03b3 5 ) (k\u0302/k 2 ) \u03b3\u03bd (1+\u03b3 5 )ue (p) in formula (19) for electron.\n\n\fThen, with the result of [4] for the neutron EDM (see Table 1), we arrive at the following quite\nstrict upper limit on the W -boson dipole moment:\ndW /e \u223c\n< 2 \u00d7 10\u221221 cm .\n\n(24)\n\nAcknowledgements.
