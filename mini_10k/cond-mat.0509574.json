Several recent experiments demonstrated that the motion of domain walls can be effectively controlled by means of an\nexternal magnetic field or an electric current.1,2,3,4,5\nThe theory of domain wall motion has been worked\nout long time ago.6,7,8 Within this theory, the magnetic\ndynamics is usually described in the framework of a classical ferromagnet assuming separation of the magnetic\nand electronic degrees of freedom. In this way three- or\ntwo-dimensional ferromagnets are treated.\nPresent studies of the domain wall dynamics are devoted to the issue of the current-induced magnetic motion in nanowires and nanoconstrictions. In the presence\nof an electric current, the domain wall can move due to a\nspin torque exerted on the magnetic system by the spinpolarized electron gas. In addition, (linear) momentum\ncan be transferred directly to the domain wall upon scattering of the charge carriers. The problem of calculating\nthe spin torque is of a prime importance for the theory of\nthe domain-wall motion, however only few recent works\naddress this point specifically.9,10,11,12,13\nThe domain-wall motion can be described by LandauLifshitz equations, which have a well-known static solution for the domain wall. Finding the corresponding\ndynamical solution is however a nontrivial task, particularly in the presence of an external force. The standard\nway is to describe the domain wall dynamics using an approximate scheme, which is based on physically reasonable arguments, but a strict mathematical justification\nis missing. The simplest approach is to use an approximate solution that assumes the moving wall to have exactly the same shape as deduced from the static solution.\nThe rigorous conditions for the range of validity of this\n\napproximation are however unclear. To obtain reliable\nresults numerical simulations are needed.14\nMost recently, new approaches have been put forward\nwhich address9,15 the calculation of the torque as well as\nthe solution of the dynamical equations of motion of the\ndomain wall. Some aspects of these works are developed\nfurther and partially revised in this paper.\nOur treatment is concentrated on the spin torque and\non the wall dynamics in a magnetic nanowire with a\ndomain wall which is sharp on the length scale set by\nthe wave length of the relevant charge carriers. The approach is thus more appropriate for the case of magnetic\nsemiconductors with a small Fermi momentum of carriers\n(electrons or holes).16\nII.\n\nCURRENT-INDUCED SPIN TORQUE\n\nHere we consider the spin torque transferred by the\nelectric current from the spin polarized electron system\nto the domain wall. The main goal of our calculation is\nthe demonstration of the presence of two components of\nthe torque, which tend to rotate the magnetic moment\nin different directions.\nWe adopt a one-dimensional model for the charge carriers with a point-like interaction between the electron spin\n\u03c3 and the magnetic moment M(x) located at a point x\nalong the wire\nHint = g \u03c3 * M(x),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is the coupling constant.\nHere the onedimensionality of the electronic system means that we\nconsider the electrons within a wire with transversal dimensions smaller than the electron wavelength \u03bb, so that\nonly the lowest electron subband is relevant. Strictly\nspeaking, the coupling of the moment to the electron\nspin depends on the coordinates y, z that characterize\n\n\f2\nthe location of the moment within the wire, g(y, z) \u223c\n2\n|\u03c80 (y, z)| , where \u03c80 (y, z) is the wave function of the\ntransverse motion of electrons in the lowest subband. For\nsimplicity, in the following we neglect this dependence,\nsubstituting\nit by an averaged coupling, g(y, z) \u2192 g =\nR\nA\u22121 g(y, z) dy dz, where A is the cross section of the\nwire.\nConsidering the scattering of electrons from a magnetic\nmoment M(x) we assume that the moment is frozen in\nthe point x on the scale of the characteristic times of the\nelectron motion. This assumption renders possible calculation of the torque as in the case of a static domain wall.\nThe calculated torque is then utilized for the investigation of the domain wall dynamics. Our assumption relies\non an adiabatic approximation insofar as we require the\ntime scale for the motion of the magnetic subsystem to\nbe slow as compared to that of the electrons.\nTo calculate the torque in the case of a sharp domain wall, we start from a model describing the onedimensional scattering from a localized moment in nonmagnetic and magnetic wires. Then we use the results\nobtained for the simplified models, to calculate the torque\nacting locally on the moments within the domain wall.\n\nA.\n\nSingle magnetic moment in a nonmagnetic wire\n\nLet us consider first scattering of electrons in\na nonmagnetic one-dimensional system (nonmagnetic\nnanowire). The electrons are scattered from a single\nfrozen magnetic moment M0 situated at the point x = 0,\ni.e., M(x) = M0 \u03b4(x). Here we denote the coordinate\nalong the wire as x. In the absence of the spin-orbit interaction, it is more convenient to use a different coordinate\nsystem (x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) for the spin space. We calculate the\ntotal scattering amplitude (beyond the Born approximation) of an electron with an arbitrary spin polarization,\ncoming from x = \u2212\u221e, and elastically scattered into the\nstates with different spin polarizations.\nAssuming the quantization axis z \u2032 along the moment\nM0 , we can write the spinor wave function of electrons\nas\n\uf8f1\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\na\nra\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n+ e\u2212ikx\n,\nx < 0,\n\uf8f2 eikx\nr\u2217 b\n\u0012 b \u0013\n\u03c8(x) =\n(2)\nta\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n,\nx\n>\n0,\n\uf8f3 eikx\nt\u2217 b\nwhere the coefficients a and b correspond to an arbitrary\nspin polarization in the incident electron wave, r and\nt are, respectively, the reflection and the transmission\ncoefficients in the spin up channel\ni\u03b1\nr=\u2212\n,\n1 + i\u03b1\n\n1\nt=\n,\n1 + i\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b1 = gM0 m/kh\u03042 , and M0 is the magnitude of the localized\nmagnetic moment.\n\nUsing Eqs. (2) and (3) we can calculate the spin density in the wire, associated with the wave function (2)\nS\u03bc (x) = \u03c8 \u2020 (x) \u03c3\u03bc \u03c8(x).\n\n(4)\n\nS\u03bc (x) stands for the oscillating spin density created by\nthe electrons reflected backwards from the localized moment, x < 0.

Note that we found the\ncomponents of torque (13), (14) in the coordinate system\nrelated to the moment M0 , so that x\u2032 and y \u2032 axes are\nperpendicular to the vector M0 , and they are not related\nin any way to the direction of the current j0 .\nUsing Eqs. (5)-(10) one can show that exactly the same\nvalues for the torque components (13),(14) are obtained\nby utilizing the relation\nT\u03bc = \u2212\n\ngM0\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb n\u03bd S\u03bb (0),\nh\u0304\n\n(16)\n\nwhich follows from the equation of motion of the magnetic moment M0 , where n is the unit vector along M0 ,\nand \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb is the unit antisymmetric tensor.\nOne can also present the result for the torque (13),(14)\nin a form, which is more appropriate for an arbitrary\ncoordinate system for the electron spin (not necessarily\nwith the axis z along M0 )\nT\u03bc =\n\nj0\n[\u03b7 (\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc n\u03bd ) s\u03bd + \u03b6 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb n\u03bd s\u03bb ] ,\ne\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n4\u03b12\n\u03b7=\n,\n1 + \u03b12\n\n2\u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03b12 )\n\u03b6 =\u2212\n.\n1 + \u03b12\n\n(18)\n\nAs we see from Eqs. (17) and (18), there are two components of the torque \u2013 both transverse to the localized\nmoment. Apart from this, one of them tends to align\nthe moment along the direction of the spin polarization\nof the incoming electrons, whereas the other one is perpendicular to the spin polarization of the incident wave.\nNote that in the Born approximation for the scattering\namplitude, which is valid for \u03b1 \u226a 1, only the second\nterm in (17) survives. It rotates the moment M0 to the\ndirection perpendicular to vector s (and also to n).\nThus, the spin torque acting on a single magnetic moment can be found as a change of the spin current due\nto scattering from the localized moment. The same result is obtained from the calculation of the interaction\nof accumulated spin with the localized moment. In the\nfollowing, to calculate the torque in the domain wall, we\nwill use both methods but the second one (coupling to\nthe accumulated spin) is more convenient in case of a\nsharp domain wall.\nWe assume that in the case of a smooth domain wall,\nit can be more convenient to solve the problem considering it as a propagation of a spin-polarized wave with\nsubsequent scattering from different magnetic moments.\nCorrespondingly, one can calculate the torque as a divergence of the spin current.\n\nB.\n\nScattering from a single magnetic moment in a\nmagnetic wire\n\nNow we calculate the torque in the case of a magnetic\nwire with the magnetization M being oriented along the\naxis x for x < 0 (left to the wall) and in the opposite\ndirection for x > 0 (right to the wall). Here we assume the spin coordinate system (x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) to coincide\nwith the the (x, y, z) one. Like in the previous problem, we introduce an additional frozen magnetic moment\nM0 = M0 (nx , ny , 0) located at the point x = 0. For\ndefiniteness, let the vector M0 lie in the x \u2212 y plane.\nThe relevant Hamiltonian has the form\nh\u03042 d2\n+ gM \u03c3x sgn (x) + gM0 n * \u03c3 \u03b4(x), (19)\n2m dx2\nFirst, we consider the torque created by a single spinpolarized wave (with the spin polarization along the axis\nx labelled as \"\u2191\") coming from the left.

(24)-(26), the transverse components\nof the spin current are oscillating functions of x. The\nnonconservation of spin current in the magnetic wire is\nrelated to indirect magnetic interactions accompanying\nthe inhomogeneous distribution of the spin density. In\nthe nonmagnetic case, corresponding to the limit of k\u2212 \u2192\n0, it reduces to the conservation of spin current at x < 0\nand x > 0, as we found in the previous section.\nThe calculation of the corresponding spin transfer (12)\nin this model gives us the following expressions for the\ncomponents of the torque\n\u0001\nT\u2191x = 2v\u2191 Re t\u2191 + (v\u2191 + v\u2193 ) |t\u2191f |2 \u2212 |t\u2191 |2 ,\n(27)\nT\u2191y = \u22122t\u2191f (v\u2191 + v\u2193 ) Im t\u2191 ,\n\n(28)\n\nT\u2191z = 2t\u2191f [v\u2191 \u2212 (v\u2191 + v\u2193 ) Re t\u2191 ] .\n\n(29)\n\nAs in the case of a nonmagnetic wire with a localized\nmoment, the torque T\u2191 can be calculated using Eq. (16)\nwith the spin density S\u2191 (0), where the index \"\u2191\" indicates\nthe accumulated spin associated with the incident wave of\nspin-up polarization. Using (4) and (20) we can calculate\nthe spin density S\u2191 (x) as in the previous section. The\nspin density oscillates for both x < 0 and x > 0, with\nthe periods 2\u03c0/k+ and 2\u03c0/ |k\u2212 | as for the spin current in\nEqs. (24)-(26).\nWith our choice of the coordinate system, when the\nvector M0 lies in the x \u2212 y plane, the transverse components of the torque acting on the moment M0 are\nT\u2191\u22a5 = \u2212ny T\u2191x + nx T\u2191y ,\n\nt\u2193 =\n\n(30)\n\nrotating the moment in x \u2212 y plane, and T\u2191z , rotating\nit in out-of-plane direction. The label \u22a5 in (30) means\nthe projection of torque on the direction perpendicular\nto the moment M0 in the x \u2212 y plane.\nSimilarly, we can consider the scattering of electron\nwith the incident spin polarization opposite to the x-axis\n(labelled as \u2193).

(33)-(35) corresponding to the majority electrons,\nare relevant. The transition to this case implies the substitutions k\u2191 \u2192 i\u03ba\u2191 .\nIn this section we calculated the wave functions of electrons in the magnetic wire with a sharp domain wall\nand a localized magnetic moment. The eigenfunctions\nof the Hamiltonian (19) correspond to the spin-polarized\nincoming waves (spin up and down). Obviously, an\narbitrary-polarized incoming wave is not the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, we can still consider the scattering of electron waves with different spin\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic picture of the domain wall.\n\npolarizations. For example, such a state can be created\nby means of an injection from the tip, and its lifetime\n\u03c4 can be long enough on the scale of the characteristic\ntime of the domain wall motion. In this case, a superposition of states with different incoming spin-polarized\nwaves can be used to calculate the torque.\n\nC.\n\nMagnetic wire with a thin domain wall\n\nIn the case of a thin metallic wire, when kF \u2191,\u2193 d \u226a 1\n(d is the wire diameter and kF \u2191,\u2193 are the Fermi momenta\nof minority and majority electrons, respectively), we can\nassume that only one quantization level is filled with electrons.\nLet us consider a magnetic wire with a single domain\nwall, with the magnetization M being directed along the\nx axis for x < \u2212w and along the opposite direction for\nx > w. Here 2w is the domain wall width, and we chose\nthe spin coordinate system like in the previous section,\nwith the x axis along the wire.\nUpon applying a small voltage an electric current flows\nin the wire. For definiteness, we assume the current to\nflow in the direction opposite to the x axis direction (i.e.,\nthe electron flux is oriented along x). If the only imperfection in the wire is the presence of the domain wall,\none can assume a jump \u2206\u03c6 in the potential at the wall,\nand both the charge and the spin currents can be calculated as integrals over energies in the interval between\n\u03b5F R and \u03b5F L = \u03b5F R + e \u2206\u03c6, where \u03b5F L and \u03b5F R are the\nFermi levels on the left and right sides. In the limit of\nsmall voltage, |e \u2206\u03c6| \u226a \u03b5F , the transport is linear and is\nassociated with electrons at the Fermi level.\nWe assume the electrons approaching the domain wall\nfrom the left are spin-polarized according to the magnetization direction in the left part of the wire. The incoming\n\nelectrons are scattered from a large number of magnetic\nmoments in the domain wall. We consider this scattering using the point interaction of electron with each of\nthe localized moments. This corresponds to the picture\nwith an array of well-separated magnetic moments like\nin the case of magnetic semiconductor doped with magnetic impurities. We assume that there is a large number\nof magnetic atoms with different orientation of moments\nwithin the domain wall. Accordingly, the electron transmitted through the wall is multiply scattered from many\nmagnetic moments.\nThus, to calculate the transmission of electrons\nthrough the domain wall, we should take the perturf\nbation created by the total magnetic moment M(x)\n=\nP\nM\n\u03b4(x\n\u2212\nx\n),\nwhere\nM\nis\nthe\nlocalized\nmoment\nat\ni\ni\ni\ni\nthe point x = xi , and all of the moments Mi are located within a region of the domain wall width, |xi | < w,\nwhich in turn is assumed to be small as compared to the\nwavelength of electrons, kF \u2191,\u2193 w \u226a 1.\nf\nThe scattering from the total moment M(x)\nlocated\nwithin a region much smaller than the electron wavelength can be described using the model of a spindependent delta-function potential.11 Then, in the limit\nof small voltage, we obtain the current\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne2 \u2206\u03c6\nv\u2193\nv\u2191\nj0 \u2243\n|t\u0303\u2191f |2 +\n|t\u0303\u2191 |2 + |t\u0303\u2193f |2 +\n|t\u0303\u2193 |2 ,\n2\u03c0h\u0304\nv\u2191\nv\u2193\n(39)\nwhere the tilde means the transmission coefficients for\n11\nthe scattering\nR +w of electrons from an effective moment\nf\nMef f \u2243 \u2212w M(x) dx. It is the B\u00fcttiker-Landauer formula for conductivity, which can be obtained in the linear response approximation, using the basis of scattering\nstates. There are two contributions in Eq. (39) related\nto the incoming waves with spin up and spin down polarizations, and with the corresponding momenta at the\nFermi surface, k\u2191,\u2193 \u2261 kF \u2191,\u2193 .\nIn the case the domain wall possesses a magnetization\nprofile as depicted in Fig. 1, the effective moment Mef f\nis oriented along the y axis. The transmission coefficients\nt\u0303\u2191 , t\u0303\u2191f and t\u0303\u2193 , t\u0303\u2193f have the form of Eqs. (22), (23) and\n(31), (32), respectively, with nx = 0, ny = 1, and the\nsubstitution g0 \u2192 g\u03030 \u2261 2mgMef f /h\u03042 . We can relate the\nmagnitude of Mef f to the\nR w continuous magnetic profile\nwithin the wall, Mef f \u2243 \u2212w My (x) dx.\nThe spin current can be also calculated in linear response approximation using the scattering states.11 It\nincludes the sum of partial spin currents\n!\ns\ns\nj\u0303\n(x)\nj\u0303\n(x)\ne\n\u2206\u03c6\n\u2191\n\u2193\njs (x) =\n,\n(40)\n+\n2\u03c0h\u0304\nv\u2191\nv\u2193\nwhere the components of j\u0303s\u2191,\u2193 can be found using\nEqs. (24)-(26) and (33)-(35) with the substitution\nt\u2191,\u2193 , t\u2191,\u2193f \u2192 t\u0303\u2191,\u2193 , t\u0303\u2191,\u2193f . The appearance of v\u2191 and v\u2193 in\nthe denominators of Eq. (40) is related to the 1D density\nof states for spin up and down electrons. The components of the spin current perpendicular to the x axis, are\n\n\f6\noscillating functions. As we see from Eqs. (24)-(26) and\n(33)-(35), the wavelength of oscillations is determined by\nthe inverse momentum at the Fermi level. Hence, the\nwavelength of oscillation of the transverse component of\nthe spin current is much larger than the domain wall\nwidth.\nIt is worth noting that in three-dimensional systems,\nthe transverse component of the spin current decays due\nto the integration over momentum in the DW plane. In\nmetallic ferromagnets, the decay is very fast due to the\nlarge Fermi momentum of electrons. However, there is a\nnonvanishing spin transfer for the transverse component\nin the 3D case, too.\nWe can also calculate the accumulated spin density induced by the external current j0 . It can be found as the\nexpectation value of the spin \u03c3\u03bc in the scattering state\nof the incoming electrons, integrated over all energies between \u03b5F and \u03b5F + e \u2206\u03c6, similar to the calculation of the\ncharge and spin currents. Accordingly, we find\n!\ne \u2206\u03c6 S\u0303\u2191 (0) S\u0303\u2193 (0)\nS(0) =\n,\n(41)\n+\n2\u03c0h\u0304\nv\u2191\nv\u2193\nwhere S\u0303\u2191,\u2193 (0) can be found using Eqs. (36)-(38) with\nnx = 0 and the substitution g0 \u2192 g\u03030 , which corresponds\nto the scattering from the effective magnetic moment\nMef f .\nFinally, we find the torque acting on a single localized\nmoment in the domain wall. For this purpose we use\nEq. (16) with S(0) from (41), describing the spin accumulation created by scattering from the domain wall as a\nwhole. In its turn, S\u0303\u2191,\u2193 (0) is calculated as explained after\nEq. (41) using (36)-(38).

In the case of small\ncoupling g\u03030 , we obtain \u03b6 \u226b \u03b7, i.e., the torque is mostly\nrelated to the second component in Eq. (42). In contrast,\nif g\u03030 is larger, the first term in (42) dominates.\n\nFIG. 3: Coefficient \u03b6 vs. coupling constant g\u03030 for different\nvalues of P .\n\n\f7\nD.\n\nSpin torque in p-type magnetic semiconductors\n\nThe conductivity of magnetic semiconductors like\nGaMnAs is usually of the p-type. The valence band\nof these semiconductors can be described by a matrix\nHamiltonian, which includes the spin-orbit interaction.17\nThus, the calculation of the transmission of holes through\nthe domain wall in GaMnAs semiconductors needs a different model, which takes into account the complex band\nstructure.\nHere we use the Luttinger model for the energy spectrum of holes with the momentum J = 3/2.18 We also neglect the anisotropy of the energy spectrum. To simplify\nthe calculations, in this section we take the quantization\naxis z along the wire. Then in the quasi-one-dimensional\ncase with the domain wall in the y \u2212 z plane, the Hamiltonian of holes is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u03042\n5\u03b32 d2\nh\u03042 \u03b32 2 d2\nH=\n\u03b31 +\n\u2212\nJ\n2m0\n2\ndz 2\nm0 z dz 2\n\u2212g [Jy My (z) + Jz Mz (z)] ,\n(45)\nwhere m0 is the mass of free electron, \u03b31 and \u03b32 are the\nLuttinger parameters, and J\u03bc are the matrices of the total momentum 3/2. Note that we are using Hamiltonian\n(45) to describe the holes like unfilled electron states in\nthe valence band. Then the correct statistics of holes corresponds to the reversed energy axis of holes as compared\nto that of electrons.\nSimilar to the previous consideration, we take the magnetization M along the axis z for z < \u2212w and in the\nopposite direction for z > w, whereas in the region of\n\u2212w < z < w the moment changes its orientation rotating\nin y \u2212 z plane. For z < \u2212w the holes can be described by\nthe energy spectrum consisting of four parabolic bands\nof the particles labelled by the momentum projection Jz\nE\u00b13/2 (k) = \u2212\n\n3gM\nh\u03042 k 2\n\u2213\n,\n2mt\n2\n\n(46)\n\ngM\nh\u03042 k 2\n\u2213\n,\n2ml\n2\n\n(47)\n\nE\u00b11/2 (k) = \u2212\n\nwhere mt = m0 /(\u03b31 \u2212 2\u03b32 ) and ml = m0 /(\u03b31 + 2\u03b32 )\nare the masses of heavy and light holes, respectively. In\naccordance with Eqs. (46) and (47), the energy band of\nthe heavy holes with the moment projection Jz = \u22123/2\nis above all other bands. In the region of z > 0 the\nspectrum is the same but with the opposite signs of Jz .\nWe assume that the holes are fully polarized so that the\nhole density is rather small. Correspondingly, we assume\nthat the chemical potential \u03bc is located in the interval of\nenergies gM/2 < \u03bc < 3gM/2.\nThe scattering state of holes corresponding to the wave\nJz = \u22123/2 incoming from z = \u2212\u221e is\n\u0001\n\u03c8 \u2020 (z) = r3\u2217 e\u03ba3 z , r2\u2217 e\u03ba2 z , r1\u2217 e\u03ba1 z , e\u2212ikz + r\u2217 eikz ,\nz < \u2212w, (48)\n\n\u0001\n\u03c8 \u2020 (z) = t\u2217 e\u2212ikz , t\u22171 e\u2212\u03ba1 z , t\u22172 e\u2212\u03ba2 z , t\u22173 e\u2212\u03ba3 z ,\nz > +w, (49)\nwhere r, r1 , ...r3 and t, t1 , ...t3 are the reflection and the\ntransmission coefficients, respectively. The momentum of\nheavy hole k is taken at the Fermi surface, \u2212h\u03042 k 2 /2mt +\n3gM/2 = \u03b5. The other momenta \u03bai correspond to\nthe decaying components of the wave function, \u03ba1 =\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\n2ml (\u03b5 \u2212 gM/2) /h\u03042\n, \u03ba2 = 2ml (\u03b5 + gM/2) /h\u03042\n,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2 1/2\nand \u03ba3 = 2mt (\u03b5 + 3gM/2) /h\u0304\n. Note that the transmission coefficient t in this notation corresponds to the\ntransmission from the state with moment Jz = \u22123/2 to\nthe state Jz = 3/2.\nIn the limit of w \u2192 0, the matching condition can be\npresented in the matrix form\n!\n\u0001\nd\u03c8\nd\u03c8\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\ndiag m\u22121\n\u2212\nt , ml , ml , mt\ndz \u03b4\ndz \u2212\u03b4\n\u2212\u03bb0 Jy \u03c8(0) = 0,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u03bb0 = 2gMef f /h\u03042 .\nUsing Eq. (50) and the continuity of the wave function\nat z = 0 we can calculate eight reflection and transmission coefficients. The accumulated spin density S(0) induced by the current flowing along z can be calculated\nlike in the previous section, but with the opposite sign\nbecause the accumulation of polarized holes means a loss\nof real particles (electrons).

(16) and (42), we find the parameters \u03b7\nand \u03b6 determining the torque acting on a single magnetic\nmoment M0\n\u03b7=\n\negM0\nSz (0),\nj0 h\u0304\n\n\u03b6 =\u2212\n2\n\negM0\nSx (0),\nj0 h\u0304\n\n(54)\n\n(55)\n\nwhere j0 = \u2212e2 \u2206\u03c6 |t| /2\u03c0h\u0304, and the \"-\" sign in current\nis due to the opposite charge of holes.\nThe dependence of \u03b7 and \u03b6 on the magnitude of magnetic splitting gM for different bulk hole densities p is\npresented in Figs. 4 and 5. We take the cross section\n\n\f8\nA = 1 nm2 , and the momentum of heavy holes k = \u03c0p1D ,\nwhere p1D is the linear density of holes.\nAs we can see from Figs. 4 and 5, the factor \u03b6 is negligibly small as compared to \u03b7. In our model, the density of\nholes and the spin splitting are independent parameters.\nThus, the magnitude of torque \u03b7 increases with the decreasing hole density p at a fixed value of gM . However,\nin real magnetic semiconductors these values are not independent, and the magnetic splitting increases with the\nincreasing hole density.19\nIt should be noted that the used condition of w \u2192 0\nimplies that not only the wavelength of holes with Jz =\n3/2 is large as compared to the domain wall width, kw \u226a\n1, but also the conditions \u03bai w \u226a 1 for all \u03bai should be\nfulfilled. This condition is restrictive for the magnitude\nof the magnetic splitting, (gM mt )1/2 w/h\u0304 \u226a 1.\n\nFIG. 4: Dependence of the factor \u03b7 on the magnetic splitting gM in the valence band of magnetic semiconductor for\ndifferent values of the bulk hole density p.\n\nIII.\n\nMOTION OF THE DOMAIN WALL\n\nA.\n\nHamiltonian and equations of motion\n\nNow we consider the Hamiltonian H0 describing a\nquasi-one-dimensional magnetic system with a domain\nwall. We adopt a model including the magnetic exchange\ninteraction and two different anisotropy constants \u03bb1 and\n\u03bb2 in the z and y directions, respectively (see Fig. 1)\nH0 =\n\na\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202n\n\u2202x\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n\u03bb1 2 \u03bb2 2\nn +\nn ,\n2 z\n2 y\n\n(56)\n\nwhere a is the constant of exchange interaction, and n(x)\nis the unit vector of magnetization. Using this Hamiltonian we are going to describe the magnetic nanowire like\npresented in Fig. 1. Correspondingly, we assume that the\nmagnetization vector field n depends only on the coordinate x and time t. The Hamiltonian H0 is the energy\ndensity of the magnetic system in the absence of the spin\ntorque.\nIn the following we restrict ourselves by considering\nthe above-calculated spin torque as a driving force acting on the domain wall. Hence, we neglect the direct\ntransfer of momentum from electrons reflected from the\ndomain wall. As we show in Appendix, this effect is\nmuch smaller than the above-calculated spin torque. On\nthe other hand, our consideration has a general character\nwithout specifying the mechanism determining the values\nof the factors \u03b7 and \u03b6.\nUsing the spherical angles \u03b8(x, t) and \u03c6(x, t), we can\nrewrite the Hamiltonian H0 as\na\nH0 =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\n\n\u00132\n\na\n+\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x\n\n\u00132\n\nsin2 \u03b8 +\n\n+\nFIG. 5: Coefficient \u03b6 vs magnetic splitting gM for different\nvalues of p.\n\n\u03bb1\ncos2 \u03b8\n2\n\n\u03bb2\nsin2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03c6.\n2\n\n(57)\n\nThe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion includes a damping term and two possible components of\n\n\f9\nthe current-induced torque, as discussed in the previous\nsection,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202n\n\u03b4H0\n\u2202\n\u03b4H0\n1 \u2202n\n\u2212 \u03b1n \u00d7\n= \u2212n \u00d7\n\u2212\n\u03b3 \u2202t\n\u03b4n\n\u2202x \u03b4(\u2202n/\u2202x)\n\u2202t\n+J0 \u03b6 n \u00d7 s + J0 \u03b7 n \u00d7 (n \u00d7 s) , (58)\nwhere \u03b1 is the damping constant, \u03b3 = g\u03bcB /h\u0304M is the gyromagnetic ratio divided by M , J0 = j0 h\u0304/eg\u03a90 , and \u03a90\nis a volume per magnetic moment. In Eq. (58) the spin\ntorque is expressed in terms of transferred moment per\nunit volume, and it enters directly the equation of motion.

The energy spectrum of this\nproblem consists of a level in the well \u03b50 \u2243 \u2212\u03bb2 and a\ncontinuous spectrum for all positive energies.\nFor \u03c6(x) = \u03c60 (x), the potential has the form of V (x) =\n\u22122\u03bb2 / cosh2 (\u03b20 x), and the discrete energy spectrum23\nhas one level \u03b50 = \u22124\u03bb2 . The eigenfunctions \u03c6n (x) corresponding to the continuous spectrum, are oscillatory\nfunctions, so that their contribution to Eq.

Thanks to \u03bb1 \u226b \u03bb2 , it is a strongly\nlocalized function on the scale of the distance (static\ndomain wall width) L0 . On the other hand, the contribution of the localized state gives us G(0) (x, x\u2032 ) \u2243\n\u2032\n(1/L0 \u03bb1 ) e\u2212\u03ba0 |x\u2212x | , where \u03ba0 = 1/L0 . Thus, in the case\nof \u03bb1 \u226b \u03bb2 (i.e., strong in-plane anisotropy), the contribution of G(0) can be neglected as compared to the\nshort-range interaction. Using the condition of strong\neasy-plane anisotropy, \u03bb1 \u226b \u03bb2 , we can simplify Eq. (66)\nessentially and obtain the expression\nG(x, x\u2032 ) \u2243\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n.\n\u03bb1\n\n(69)\n\nIn this approximation, the Lagrangian (64) acquires the\nfollowing form\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012\n\u00132\nZ\n1\n1 \u2202\u03c6\na \u2202\u03c6\nL = A dx\n\u2212 J0 \u03b7 sin \u03c6 \u2212\n2\u03bb1 \u03b3 \u2202t\n2 \u2202x\n\u0015\n\u03bb2\nsin2 \u03c6 + J0 \u03b6 cos \u03c6 .

It means, that in the absence of the current,\nthe solution for a moving domain wall is more sharp as\ncompared to the static wall.\nFor j0 6= 0 and v \u2192 0, the value of \u03b2 depends on the\ncurrent as \u03b2 2 = \u03b202 (1 \u2212 J02 \u03b7 2 a/\u03bb1 \u03bb2 ), i.e., the current\nmakes the thickness of the static domain wall larger.\nNow we can use the velocity v as a variational parameter to minimize the Lagrangian\nA F (v)\nL=\n2\u03b2(v)\n\nZ\n\nsin2 \u03c6(x) d(\u03b2x),\n\n(73)\n\nwhere\nF (v) =\n(71)\n\nNow we can study the problem of the domain wall dynamics in terms of a single \u03c6(x, t) field.\nC.\n\nFIG. 6: Dependence of the parameter \u03b2 on the domain wall\nvelocity \u1e7d for different values of the current.\n\nSolution for \u03b6 = 0\n\nLet us consider the possibility of the kink-like solution\nmoving with an arbitrary constant velocity v, \u03c6(x, t) \u2261\n\u03c6(x\u2212vt). We can find such solutions in the case of \u03b6 = 0,\ntrying a function which obeys the equality \u2202\u03c6(x)/\u2202x =\n\u03b2 sin \u03c6(x). This function differs from the static solution\nonly by a different choice of \u03b2 instead of \u03b20 = (\u03bb2 /a)1/2 .\nSubstituting it into (71), we obtain the equation that\nrelates the values of \u03b2 and v as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ 2 \u03b72\nv2\n2\n\u2212 \u03bb2 + 0\n= 0.\n(72)\n\u03b2 a\u2212 2\n\u03b3 \u03bb1\n\u03bb1\n\n\u0014\n\u00152\n1 v \u03b2(v)\n+ J0 \u03b7 \u2212 a\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03bb2 ,\n\u03bb1\n\u03b3\n\n(74)\n\nthe function \u03b2(v) is defined by Eq. (72), and the integral\nin (73) does not depend on v.\nUsing Eqs. (72) to (74) we find that for j0 = 0, the\nquantity F (v) = \u2212\u03bb2 for any v. Thus, the minimum\nof L corresponds to \u03b2 = \u03b20 , which is the minimum\nvalue of the dependence \u03b2(v) for j0 = 0. In the limit\nof a Rsmall velocity, v 2 \u226a \u03b3 2 \u03bb1 a, and using the relation sin2 \u03c6(\u03b1) d\u03b1 = 2, we find the kinetic energy of\nthe moving domain\nin the form of Ekin = m\u2217 v 2 /2,\n\u221a wall\n\u221a\n\u2217\n2\nwhere m = A \u03bb2 /\u03b3 \u03bb1 a is the effective mass of the\ndomain wall. This is in agreement with the definition\nfrom Ref. [7] for \u03bb1 = 2\u03c0M 2 .\nFor j0 6= 0, we can present the dependence of the factor\nF on both parameters v and j0 as\n\"\n\nF (v) = \u2212\u03bb2 1 \u2212\n\n2j\u030302\n\n\u2212 2j\u03030 \u1e7d\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 j\u030302\n1 \u2212 \u1e7d 2\n\n\u00131/2 #\n\n.\n\n(75)\n\n\f11\nIn the limit of v \u2192 0, the factor F changes its sign for\nj0 > j0 cr , where\n\u221a\ne\u03a90 \u03bb1 \u03bb2\n(76)\nj0 cr = \u221a\n2 h\u0304\u03b7\nis the critical current. Thus, if j0 > j0 cr , the solution\nwith moving domain wall is energetically favorable.\nWe can interpret the effect of the current as leading to\nan effective reduction of the effective mass of the domain\nwall. For j0 > j0 cr the current induces an instability\ntowards a spontaneous motion of the wall.\nD.\n\nCase of \u03b6 6= 0\n\nIn the case of \u03b6 6= 0, there are no solutions of Eq. (71)\ncorresponding to the motion of the domain wall with a\nconstant velocity because the last term in this equation\nacts as a force accelerating the domain wall. Indeed,\nif we assume a probe solution in the form of \u03c6(x, t) \u2261\n\u03c6[x \u2212 x0 (t)] we find\nm\u2217 \u1e8d0 (t) + J0 A\u03b6 = 0,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere m is a constant in the limit of a small velocity.\nIn other words, Eq. (77) describes the acceleration of the\ndomain wall just after we apply some voltage. Hence, our\nmodel can describe the steady state if we include a viscosity (friction) into the equation of motion. We can use the\ndamping term from Eq. (58). Writing the corresponding\nadditional term in Eq. (71) as Fd = \u2212\u03b1 \u2202\u03c6/\u2202t, we find\nthe following equation that determines the velocity of the\nmoving domain wall as follows\nv \u03b2(v) \u2243\n\nJ0 \u03b6\n.\n\u03b1\n\n(78)\n\nThis equation indicates a linear dependence of the velocity on the current in the limit of a small velocity, when\n\u03b2 is constant. As we see from Eq. (78), it corresponds to\na large damping.\nEffective friction may as well stem from the pinning\nby impurities. This case can be described phenomenologically leading to another mechanism for the critical\ncurrent.9\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe calculated the components of the spin torque acting\non a thin domain wall in a magnetic nanowire subject\nto an electric current. These components can induce a\nrotation of magnetic moments in different directions.\nWe also considered the dynamics of a domain wall in\nthe presence of the current. We demonstrated that a\nmoving magnetic kink, similar to the static domain wall,\ncan be a solution of the equations for the magnetic dynamics only at some special conditions. We found these\n\nconditions in the case of a large ratio of the magnetic\nanisotropy constants. In the limit of small velocities, the\nsolution does look like a kink but its width decreases with\nincreasing velocity. In the limit of a small velocity, the\ndomain wall moves like a particle of a mass determined\nby the exchange interaction and anisotropies. One of\nthe spin torque components \u03b6, dominating at the small\ncoupling, acts as a moving force on the domain wall, accelerating the wall, provided that there is no pinning to\nimpurities.\nRecent direct observations of the domain-wall configurations show that the spin structure of the wall changes\nwith the current, and the structure depends on the velocity of the domain wall motion.5\nWe performed the calculation of torque in the limit of\nthin domain wall, w \u226a \u03bbF . It allows to simplify essentially the problem and to do all the calculations analytically. In reality, this inequality may be not well satisfied\neven in the magnetic semiconductors. Here we present\nthe estimations for the case when the above-mentioned\ninequality is obeyed.\nLet us take the cross section of the wire A = 1 nm2 and\nthe bulk carrier density n3D = 1019 cm\u22123 , corresponding\nto the linear density n1D = n3D A = 105 cm\u22121 . It gives\nus kF = \u03c0n1D \u2243 3\u00d7105 cm\u22121 , and the carrier wavelength\n\u03bbF = 2\u03c0/kF \u2243 100 nm.\nTo estimate the domain wall width, we assume the\nmagnitude of magnetization M = 100 Oe, the demagnetizing factor along the y axis n(y) = 0.3, and calculate the\nanisotropy constant as \u03bb2 \u2243 8\u03c0n(y) M 2 \u2243 105 erg/cm3 .\nFor the energy of magnetic interaction Eint \u2243 10 meV\nat a distance between magnetic ions of c0 = 1 nm,\nthe exchange parameter a = Eint c0 /A \u2243 10\u22128 erg/cm.\nThen the domain wall width has a reasonable value of\nw = (a/\u03bb2 )1/2 \u2243 10 nm. Comparing these estimations,\nwe see that the main inequality of w \u226a \u03bbF is satisfied.\nAt a larger carrier density, both w and \u03bb can be of the\nsame order of magnitude or the inequality is reversed like\nin magnetic metals. In this case, the constants \u03b6 and \u03b7\nshould be calculated numerically.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nV.D. thanks P. M. Levy for valuable discussions concerning the accumulation of spin.

In the presence of electric current transmitted through the magnetic wire, it\ncreates an additional force acting on the wall.8 Here we\nestimate the magnitude of this effect in the case of a thin\nDW, kF w \u226a 1.\nThe force F is determined by the total transferred momentum in unit time. Taking into account the contribution of spin up and down scattering states corresponding\nto the waves incoming from \u2212\u221e in the energy range between \u03b5F and \u03b5 + e \u2206\u03c6, we find\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\nv\u2191\nv\u2191\ne\u2206\u03c6\n2\n2\n2\n2\nk\u2191 1 + |r\u2191 | \u2212 |t\u2191f | +\n|r\u2193f | \u2212\n|t\u2193 |\nF=\n2\u03c0\nv\u2193\nv\u2193\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\nv\u2193\nv\u2193\n2\n2\n2\n2\n.(A1)\n|r\u2191f | \u2212\n|t\u2191 |\n+k\u2193 1 + |r\u2193 | \u2212 |t\u2193f | +\nv\u2191\nv\u2191\nThis force tends to shift the domain wall along the x\ndirection. For a local moment within the wall it is equivalent to the appearance of a torque. To estimate the\nmagnitude of this mechanical torque acting on a single\nmoment we use a simplified model.\nWe describe the domain wall by the \u03c6(x) field, which\nis the angle in x \u2212 y plane determining the direction of\nmoment M(x) as shown in Fig. 1. We assume that the\nshift along x is related to the following interaction\nHint = \u03bb\u03c6(x) v(x),\n\n(A2)\n\nv(x) has the form of a potential well in the vicinity of\nthe domain wall, and it forces (makes energetically favorable) a correction to the \u03c6(x) field of the same form,\n\u03b4\u03c6(x) \u223c d\u03c60 /dx. On the other hand, the correction\n\u03b4\u03c6(x) = (d\u03c6/dx) \u03b4x0 is the shift along the axis x by\n\u03b4x0 . Thus, the interaction term in form of (A2) in the\nequation of motion for the \u03c6(x) acts as a shifting force.\nThe constant \u03bb should be determined by the condition\nthat the energy \u03b4E associated with the shift, gives the\nforce F :\n\u00132\nZ \u0012\n\u03b4E\nd\u03c60\nF =\u2212\n= \u03bbA\ndx.\n(A3)\n\u03b4x0\ndx\nUsing the known solution, d\u03c60 /dx = \u03b2 sin \u03c60 (x), we find\n\u03bb = F /2\u03b2A.\nThe equation of motion for \u03c6(x) (64) includes the additional torque term as \u03bbv(x) = F v(x)/2\u03b2A.
