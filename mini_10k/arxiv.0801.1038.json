A detailed description of\nthe experimental equipment is given.

For the silicon devices, numerical simulations\nbased on recently developed high temperature physical models\nwere also performed in order to gain a deeper understanding of\nthe measured data, together with a revalidation of the model\nparameters.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nElectronic devices and modules are increasingly employed\nin very hot environments such as combustion engines, car\nbrake systems, turbines or well drilling. Therefore, the high\ntemperature characterization of semiconductor devices is\ngetting more and more practical relevance. However, since\ncommercial probe stations do usually not allow for\nmeasurements at very high temperatures, semiconductor\ndevices developed to operate in this temperature range cannot\nbe properly characterized using standard equipment. Up to\nnow, only little experimental equipment suited for the\nelectrothermal analysis of semiconductor devices at very high\ntemperatures has been reported. Reggiani at al. [1,2] used a\nmodified commercial high temperature oven for\nmeasurements on samples at temperatures as high as 800\u00b0C.\nRF measurements on wafers at temperatures up to 500\u00b0C were\ndescribed in [3].\nWith continuously decreasing size and increasing\ncomplexity of semiconductor devices, device simulations play\nan essential role for their optimal design. Device simulations\nstrongly rely on the quality of the physical models\nimplemented in the applied software. This is particularly true\nfor the simulation of high temperature device properties. Till\nlately, there were no validated models available for\ntemperatures above 250\u00b0C [4]. Only in recent work the\ntemperature range for calibrated models has been extended to\nabout 400\u00b0C for the mobility models and even 800\u00b0C for the\nimpact ionization coefficients [1,2,5]. We used these new\nmodels for the simulation of the high temperature device\nbehavior described below.\nThis work was founded by the Dr. Johannes Heidenhain-Stiftung GmbH and\nthe BMBF under contract 01 M 3079E.\n\nIn the following we describe a versatile, dedicated\nexperimental set-up for the electrical and thermal\ncharacterization of semiconductor devices and test structures.\nThe measurements are performed under high vacuum\nconditions which provides an excellent thermal isolation of the\ndevice under test and, at the same time, prevents the\ndegradation of then sample and the system parts due to the\nexposure to the oxygen in the surrounding air. Apart from\nmeasuring device terminal characteristics, the extraction of\nmaterial properties like carrier mobilities, generationrecombination rates, impact ionization rates, thermal\nconductivity and others may be performed. The results will be\nused in the refinement and calibration of physical device\nmodels required for the simulation of the high temperature\ndevice behavior.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP\nA schematic view of the experimental set-up is shown in\nFig. 1. It consists of two main building blocks: A vacuum\nsystem and a set of measuring instruments controlled by a\ncomputer. The vacuum system comprises Trinos modular\nvacuum chambers [6] with an inner diameter of 40 cm and a\nLeybold PT 151 pumping unit [7] consisting of a rotary pump\nand a turbomolecular pump (Fig. 2). The lower one of the two\nchambers has several ports for electrical feedthroughs as well\nas a feedthrough for the cooling liquid.\n\nFigure 1. Block diagram of the high-temperature measurement set-up.\n\n\fFigure 4. High-temperature circuit for pulsed measurements\n\nFigure 2. View of the vacuum system.\n\nThe chamber bell can be lifted by means of a motorized\nwinch, thus facilitating the access to the measuring platform\ninside the vacuum chamber. The minimum achievable\npressure in the vacuum chamber is about 1 mPa which is\nlimited by the kind of the flanges used in our system (KFflanges) as well as the size of the vacuum chambers and the\npumps. However, this pressure is fully sufficient for the\npurpose of this system. The pumping station can alternatively\nbe connected to the vacuum chamber of a second module for\nHall measurement.\nInside the vacuum chamber, different exchangeable\nmeasuring platforms can be used depending on the kind of the\nmeasurement task. Currently, a general-purpose prober unit\n(Fig. 3) and a platform with a circuit for high current pulsed\nmeasurements (Fig. 4 and 5) are in use. Both systems are inhouse developments.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nHigh-temperature sample prober\n\nFigure 5. Detailed view of the sample ceramic substrate with electrical\ncontacts. The heating coil is located below the substrate.\n\nThe sample stage of the general-purpose prober unit is\nmade of a circular copper plate with a resistive heating coil\nunderneath. With this unit, a maximum temperature of about\n600 \u00b0C can be reached. For temperature measurement a PT100\nplatinum resistor gauge is used which is placed in the vicinity\nof the sample. Stainless steel manipulators with coax-cable\n(RG402) cantilevers fixed on top of the manipulators are used\nfor contacting the samples. On one end of the cable (about 6\nmm) the shielding and the PTFE-dielectric has been removed\nand the core (silver-plated steel, diameter 0.9 mm) has been\nsharpened to form a probe tip with a radius of approx. 100 \u03bcm.\nA temperature control and power supply circuit reads and\nconverts the PT100 resistance values. All data is collected by a\nPC using a PCI-6014 A/D-converter (National Instruments).\nThe whole heating system is controlled by a LabVIEW\u00ae\nprogram developed for the specific measurement\nrequirements. Currently, another platform is being developed,\non which by the use of an electron beam heater measurements\nup to temperatures of 800-1000\u00b0C will be achieved.\nThe electrical characterization of the samples is performed\nusing an Agilent E5270B modular parameter analyzer. It is\nconnected to the PC via an RS232/GPB-interface and\ncontrolled by LabVIEW\u00ae software.\n\n\fFigure 6. Experimental TLP-System\n\nA number of different measurement modes such as\nstaircase sweep or pulsed measurement can be selected for\ncurrent-voltage characteristics. The E5270B parameter\nanalyzer is very well suited for measurements in the low and\nvery low current and voltage range. The maximum current in\nour present instrumental configuration is limited to 1.5 A and\nthe shortest pulse length possible is 500\u03bcs.\nWith a view to extending the capabilities of our set-up to\ntransient recording and higher terminal currents, as it is\nrequired for the analysis of power devices, a dedicated\nelectronic circuitry had to be developed. Currently this circuit\nis able to generate current pulses of max. 200A and pulse\nlengths between 2 \u03bcs and 100 \u03bcs. The resistive heating coil is\nattached to the backside of the ceramic substrate holding the\ndevice under test by means of a two-component ceramic\nadhesive (Fig. 4 and 5).\nFor high-temperature analysis with very short pulses in the\nrange of 10-500ns and voltage amplitudes up to several\nkilovolts a TLP-System is currently under development.\nFigure 6 shows an experimental version of the TLP-System\nused for exploratory tests [8]. This system will enable the\ninvestigation of breakdown phenomena in electronic devices\nunder extreme temperature conditions.\nIII. DIE-BONDING\nThe stability and robustness of the die attachment and the\nwire bonds is the crucial point for measurements at very high\ntemperature. In order to achieve stable measurement\nconditions even for temperatures above 700 K, a special die\nbonding technique (described as NTV process in [9]) is\nemployed. With this process, a very reliable bonding is\nachieved by applying high mechanical pressure on a porous\nsilver foil placed between the die backside and the metallized\nsubstrate at elevated temperature (Fig. 7). The result is a thin\nsintered layer between die and substrate with excellent\nbonding properties over a wide range of temperature. Due to\nthe very good electrical and thermal conductivity of silver, its\nhigh melting temperature and a well-adapted coefficient of\nthermal expansion, this bonding method seems to be the best\nchoice for high-temperature test samples.\nA relatively high pressure of about 4x107 Pa and heating\nabove 200\u00b0C was applied in the original work [9]. As a\nsuitable press for such high mechanical pressure was not\navailable to us, we developed a simple manual press which\ncan be inserted into an oven for the heating step.\n\nFigure 7. Principle of the NTV die bonding technique (left) and a simple\nmanual press developed in-house (right), which allows for die bonding on\nsubstrates as large as 22x22 mm2.\n\nThe maximum pressure achieved with this press was estimated\nto be about 1x107 Pa. As this value is lower compared to that\nin [9], we had to raise the sintering temperature to about\n260\u00b0C and extend the pressing time to about 1h in order to\nachieve comparable results. All samples bonded by this\nmethod proved to be mechanically and electrically very stable:\nThere were no signs of failure even after repeated heating up\nto 500\u00b0C.\nIV. HIGH-TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT AND SIMULATION\nON TEST DEVICES\nFigure 8 shows the measured and the simulated transfer\ncharacteristics, respectively, of a 75V MOSFET placed within\na PCM test structure, which had been fabricated by means of\nthe so-called SFET2 process technology available at Infineon.\nThe PCM test structure comprises 38 MOSFET cells only,\nwhereas the full device consists of about 500,000 cells.\nAs we can recognize from Fig. 8, the basic MOSFET\noperation stays stable (with negative temperature coefficient)\nup to a temperature of about 300\u00b0C. Above this temperature\nlevel, the drain current increases with temperature so that the\ndevice is likely to run into an electrothermal instability leading\neventually to device failure. However, already between 200\u00b0C\nand 300\u00b0C we find a significant increase in the subthreshold\ncurrent and a decrease of the threshold voltage, which is\nconsiderably larger than that at lower temperatures. This\ndevice degradation is mainly caused by the decreasing\nelectron mobility and the increasing thermal generation of\nelectron-hole pairs observed at rising lattice temperature.\nIt turns out that the high-temperature simulation models,\nwhich should be able to cover the full temperature range of the\nmeasured data, still need a recalibration of the model\nparameters. With the given temperature dependence in the\nphysical models as implemented in DESSIS, it is virtually\nimpossible to find a single parameter set that would perfectly\ndescribe the device operation for all temperature values\nbetween room temperature and 400\u00b0C. An acceptable\nagreement between measurement and simulation could only\nbe achieved after re-adjusting the temperature dependence in a\nnumber of model parameters. Actually, this re-adjustment had\nto be made for the parameters of band gap narrowing, channel\nmobilities, and generation-recombination processes.\nThe next device type investigated in this work was a 600 V\nNPT (non-punch-through) IGBT. Due to their specific\nstructure, IGBTs show a high-temperature behaviour that\n\n\fbetween room temperature and 400\u00b0C. As shown in Figure 9,\nthe breakdown voltage increases linearly with temperature in\nthe whole temperature range investigated. The corresponding\nsimulations were performed using the traditional mobility\nmodel of Masetti et al [10] as well as the new model\ndeveloped at the University of Bologna. The parameters used\nin these simulations were the same as those obtained from the\nquasi-static simulation of the transfer characteristics (i.e. the\nsimulation data shown in Fig. 10 are based on the re-calibrated\nmodels rather than the result of a fit). This example suggests\nthe conclusion that the re-calibrated physical models provide a\nsatisfactory description of MOSFET-like devices.\n\nFigure 8. Transfer characteristics of a silicon VDMOSFET test structure.\nSolid lines: Measurement; Symbols: Simulation.\n\nFigure 10. VDMOSFET test structure. Breakdown voltage as a function of\ntemperature. Solid line: measurement; Symbols: simulation.\n\nFigure 9. Transfer characteristics of an IGBT-device. Solid lines:\nMeasurement; Symbols: Simulation.\n\ncombines that of a MOSFET with that of a BJT. As a result,\nthe forward characteristics exhibit two voltage regions with a\npositive, BJT-type, and a negative, MOSFET-type\ntemperature coefficient. There exists also one operating point\n(UCE, ICE) in the characteristics which is nearly independent of\ntemperature. Measured and simulated transfer characteristics\nare shown in Figure 10.\nThe avalanche breakdown voltage constitutes the maximum\nvoltage a semiconductor device can sustain in the blocking\nstate. It is therefore one of the most important parameters that\nspecifies the safe operating area of the device. For p-n\njunctions, it is known that the avalanche breakdown voltage\nincreases with increasing temperature due to the lattice\nscattering rate of the charge carriers. We have measured the\nstatic drain-source breakdown voltage for temperatures\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFigure 11. VDMOSFET test structure. a) Simulated electron current density\nfor UD=UBV ; b) Simulated electron current density along the x- coordinate\nline y=3 \u03bcm in the upper figure.\n\n\fMore details of the physical process occurring during\navalanche breakdown in the interior of these devices are\nshown in Fig. 11. The distribution of the electron current at the\nonset of breakdown for temperatures between 27\u00b0C and 400\u00b0C\nare displayed in Figure 11a. It demonstrates the uncontrolled\nshift of the current path from the body-epilayer diode to the\nparasitic n-p-n transistor indicating the turn on of the latter at\nabout 200\u00b0C. Figure 11b shows the radial electron current\ndistribution at a depth of 3 \u03bcm. It makes evident that at 400\u00b0C\na significant part of the avalanche current flows through the\nparasitic transistor. These facts are closely related to the\nfindings reported by Icaza-Deckelmann et al. [11] considering\nthe unclamped inductive switching failure of DMOStransistors.\nFor the device simulations we used a version of the\ncommercial simulation tool DESSIS (formerly ISE-TCAD,\nnow Synopsys) [12], in which these extended high temperature models were available.
