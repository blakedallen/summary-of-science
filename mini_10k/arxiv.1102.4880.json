One empirical constraint [1] is that the height is limited\nto\nh11 + h21 \u2264 502,\n(1)\nleaving us only with a finite number of possible Hodge numbers. Not having made\nany progress in the way of an upper bound for the height, one might want to ask\nwhether there is any lower bound [2, 3, 4]. In fact, just looking at the lists of complete intersections in projective spaces (CICY [5, 6]) yields h11 + h21 \u2265 30 and the\nhypersurfaces in toric varieties satisfy h11 +h21 \u2265 29. However, dividing out free group\nactions almost always lowers the Hodge numbers (and never raises them), so these\nnaive lower bounds for the height can be easily violated [7, 8, 9]. From a physics perspective, this serves both to reduce the number of moduli [10, 11, 12, 13] and, via the\nHosotani mechanism [14, 15, 16], to break the GUT gauge group. By systematically\nconstructing free quotients of CICY threefolds [17, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21], one can push\ndown the lower boundary for the height to h11 + h21 = 4. In particular, a minimal\nthree-generation manifold [22] with (h11 , h21 ) = (4, 1) can thus be realized.\nHowever, one might wonder if even smaller Hodge numbers are possible. In particular, the minimal value for a non-rigid Calabi-Yau threefold would be (h11 , h21 ) = (1, 1).\nThe purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, and construct a \"minimal\" Hodge number\n2\n\n\fexample. The idea, in a nutshell, is to look for permutation actions that act simply\ntransitively 1 on the vertices of a lattice polytope, and use this to define a group action on a anticanonical hypersurface in the corresponding toric variety. Those familiar\nwith such constructions will immediately notice that this almost implies that there\nis a single complex structure modulus. However, various technical details need to be\nchecked before one can conclude that this quotient is, indeed, a smooth Calabi-Yau\nthreefold.\nIn Section 2, I will start with some elementary properties of the 24-cell lattice\npolytope that I will use in the following. In Section 3, I am going to define a group\naction and compute the fixed point sets on the ambient toric variety defined by the\nlattice polytope. Then, in Section 4, I will check that it leads to a desired free action\non a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, leading to Hodge numbers (1, 1) on the smooth quotient\nthreefold. Finally, in Section 5, I will quickly go through two similar group actions\nand all partial quotients. All toric geometry computations used in this paper were\ndone using [23, 24, 25, 26].\n\n2\n\nThe 24-Cell\n\nThere are six 4-dimensional regular polytopes, the 4-simplex, 4-cube, 16-cell, 24-cell,\n120-cell and 600-cell. Apart from the 24-cell, these are higher-dimensional analogues\nof the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. In particular, they transform in the same way under duality.2 The 24-cell is the regular 4dimensional polytope that does not have a 3-dimensional analog. For lack of anything\nelse to transform into, it is also self-dual. A curious fact, that has already been remarked in [1], is that the 24-cell appears as one of the 473,800,776 reflexive 4-d lattice\npolytopes. In fact, the 24-cell can be constructed as the convex hull of the 24 roots\nof the D4 lattice. Amongst all 4-d reflexive lattice polytopes, it is the one with the\nlargest symmetry group [1]. The symmetry group obviously must contain the Weyl\ngroup of D4 , but is actually larger. In fact, the full symmetry group of the 24-cell is\nthe Weyl group of F4 and has 1152 elements.\n\n3\n\nA Toric Variety with SL(2,3) Action\n\n3.1\n\nThe Face Fan\n\nFollowing the usual notation of toric geometry [27, 28, 29], we will identify the 4dimensional root lattice of D4 with N ' Z4 . Doing so breaks much of the symmetry\n1\n\nThat is, for any two vertices v1 , v2 there exists a unique group element g \u2208 G with g(v1 ) = v2 .\nThe tetrahedron is self-dual, cube and octahedron are exchanged, and dodecahedron and icosahedron are exchanged.\n2\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 2: Steregraphic projection of the 24-cell into 3 dimensions.\n\nand the coordinates of the vertices do not manifest the 24-cell structure at all. However, picking a basis is convenient for direct computation and we will the particular\nlattice basis of Tables 1 and 2 in the following. Given these 24 points, we define the\npolytope\n\b\n\u2207 = conv p1 , p2 , . . . , p24 .\n(2)\nEach of the 24 facets of \u03bb is an octahedron, and spans one generating cone in the face\nfan\n\b\nF\u2207 = hp2 , p6 , p10 , p14 , p18 , p21 i,\n\nhp10 , p12 , p14 , p16 , p21 , p24 i, hp2 , p10 , p12 , p19 , p20 , p21 i,\n\nhp6 , p8 , p14 , p16 , p21 , p23 i, hp2 , p4 , p6 , p8 , p20 , p21 i, hp8 , p12 , p16 , p20 , p21 , p22 i,hp1 , p5 , p9 , p13 , p17 , p18 i,\nhp9 , p11 , p13 , p15 , p17 , p24 i, hp1 , p3 , p9 , p11 , p17 , p19 i,hp5 , p7 , p13 , p15 , p17 , p23 i, hp1 , p3 , p4 , p5 , p7 , p17 i,\nhp3 , p7 , p11 , p15 , p17 , p22 i,hp9 , p10 , p13 , p14 , p18 , p24 i, hp1 , p2 , p9 , p10 , p18 , p19 i, hp9 , p10 , p11 , p12 , p19 , p24 i,\nhp5 , p6 , p13 , p14 , p18 , p23 i, hp1 , p2 , p4 , p5 , p6 , p18 i, hp4 , p5 , p6 , p7 , p8 , p23 i,hp13 , p14 , p15 , p16 , p23 , p24 i,\nhp1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p19 , p20 i, hp11 , p12 , p15 , p16 , p22 , p24 i,hp3 , p11 , p12 , p19 , p20 , p22 i, hp7 , p8 , p15 , p16 , p22 , p23 i,\nhp3 , p4 , p7 , p8 , p20 , p22 i\n\n.

By definition, the 4-dimensional toric variety P\u2207 comes with an action of\n(C\u00d7 )4 such that there is a single maximal-dimensional orbit, which I will denote as\nPhi in the following. In the usual correspondence between torus orbits and cones of\nthe fan, this is the orbit associated to the trivial cone hi. In terms of homogeneous\ncoordinates, it is the locus where no homogeneous coordinate vanishes. The maximal\norbit itself is always smooth as singular points must fill out whole torus orbits.\n3\n\nBy abuse of notation, we will not distinguish the group from its matrix and permutation representation in the following.\n\n6\n\n\fp2\n\np4\np20\n\np19\n\np1\n\np3\n\nFigure 3: One facet of the 24-cell with its spanning vertices.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we will be investigating the fixed points of G '\nSL(2, 3) on the maximal torus. Since all homogeneous coordinates are invertible there,\nwe can freely use the homogeneous rescalings to set some homogeneous coordinates\nto unity.

Clearly, the basis for the relations eq. (10) allows us to unambiguously\nscale z5 , . . . , z24 to unity on the maximal torus.\n\n3.3\n\nFixed Points on the Maximal Torus\n\nTo find the fixed points of the G-action on the toric variety P\u2207 , we need to look at each\nconjugacy class of G. Excluding the identity of G, there are 6 non-trivial conjugacy\nclasses. For the remainder of this section, I will discuss each in turn.\nThe conjugacy class of g42\nThe first conjugacy class is of order 2 and contains the single central group element\ng42 = diag(\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121).\n\n(12)\n\nIts action on the homogeneous coordinates on the maximal torus Phi is\ng42\n\n\u0010\u0002\n\u0003\u0011\nz1 : z2 : z3 : z4 : 1 : * * * : 1 =\n\u0003\n\u0002\nz4\n=\n= 1:* * *:1 :\nz3\n: z2 : z1 : 1 : * * * : 1 :\n|{z}\n|{z}\n|{z} |{z}\n16\n15\nPosition 24\nPosition 14\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 1 1 1\n=\n:\n:\n:\n: 1 : * * * : 1 .

Since a g4 g2\nfixed point is also a g42 -fixed point, we immediately note that Pghi4 \u2282 Phi4 is again a\ndiscrete set of points. Explicitly, the g4 -fixed point set turns out to be 4 out of the 12\nfixed points of g42 , namely\nn\nPghi4 = [+1 : +1 : +1 : +1 : 1 : * * * : 1],\n[+1 : \u22121 : \u22121 : +1 : 1 : * * * : 1],\n[\u22121 : +1 : \u22121 : \u22121 : 1 : * * * : 1], o\n[\u22121 : \u22121 : +1 : \u22121 : 1 : * * * : 1] .\n8\n\n(15)\n\n\fThe conjugacy classes of g3 and g32\nThe third and fourth conjugacy class can be represented by g3 and g32 , respectively.\nThey are both of order 3 and contain 4 representatives. In fact, they are related by an\nautomorphism of G and, therefore, one only needs to discuss g3 , say.

An explicit computation shows that g3 g42 fixes the single point\nn\u0002\n\u0003o\ng g2\nPhi3 4 = 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : * * * : 1\n(20)\non the maximal torus.\n4\n\nI will always think of the equations of the fixed points on the maximal torus as an ideal in the\npolynomial ring in the formal commutative variables z1 , z1\u22121 , . . . , z4 , z4\u22121 subject to the relations\nz1 z1\u22121 = 1, . . . , z4 z4\u22121 = 1.\n\n9\n\n\f3.4\n\nStanley-Reisner Ideal and Other Fixed Points\n\nThus far, I have shown that any element of G ' SL(2, 3) fixes a discrete set of points\non the maximal torus Phi ' (C\u00d7 )4 , that is, on the locus where all homogeneous variables are non-zero. The 4-dimensional toric variety P\u2207 is a compactification of Phi\nby gluing in lower-dimensional toric varieties associated to the non-empty cones of\nthe fan F\u2207 . One needs to discuss fixed points on these lower-dimensional strata as\nwell. The main observation is that, given any g \u2208 G, if the i-th homogeneous variable\nzi vanishes, the permuted homogeneous variable zg(i) has to vanish as well on the gfixed point set. In other words, the g-fixed point sets on the lower-dimensional strata\nare contained in the subvarieties where whole g-permutation orbits of homogeneous\nvariables vanish. As in the previous section, I will discuss each conjugacy class separately. Note that because G acts regularly (simply transitively) on the 24 variables,\nall g \u2208 G-orbits are of the same size.\nThe conjugacy class of g42\nThe 24 homogeneous variables z1 , . . . , z24 form 12 orbits of length 2 under the permutation g42 . For example, the orbit containing the first variable is {z1 , zg42 (i) } = {z1 , z16 }.\nTherefore, the fixed point set away from the maximal torus is contained in the union\nof the 12 subvarieties\n\u0010\n\u0011g42\n[\n\u0001\nV hzg(1) = 0, zg(16) = 0i .\n(21)\nP\u2207 \u2212 Phi\n\u2282\ng\u2208G\n\nThe conjugacy class of g4\nThe homogeneous variables form 6 orbits of length 4.

(27)\n\nWe notice that any potential fixed point in P\u2207 \u2212 Phi , that is, outside of the maximal\ntorus, is contained in the exceptional set, see eqns. (21), (22), (23), and (24). To\nsummarize, all fixed point sets of all non-trivial group elements g \u2208 G are finite6 and\ncontained in the maximal torus Phi ,\n[\n\nPg\u2207 \u2282 Phi ' (C\u00d7 )4 ( P\u2207\n\n(28)\n\ng\u2208G\u2212{1}\n5\n6\n\nThe \"minimal\" monomials are zi1 * * * zik such that {i1 , . . . , ik } is a primitive collection.\nNote that the fixed point set is automatically finite if it is contained in the maximal torus.\n\n11\n\n\f3.5\n\nSingularities\n\nEach of the 24 generating cones of the fan, for example hp1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p19 , p20 i, is not\nsmooth.7 This gives rise to 24 singular points of the toric variety P\u2207 . All other cones\nof the fan (of dimension \u2264 3) are smooth, and, therefore, P\u2207 is smooth outside of the\n24 singular points.\nIn terms of homogeneous coordinates, these singular points are\nn\no\n\u0001\nSing(P\u2207 ) = V zg(1) , zg(2) , zg(3) , zg(4) , zg(19) , zg(20) g \u2208 G .\n(29)\nSince the maximal cones are not simplicial, the singular points are worse than orbifold\nsingularities by a finite group.\nIn the remainder of this section I will investigate the singularities further. However,\nthe details will not be important for the following. Now, since each singularity is\npurely local data, it is most convenient to use\u0001the description of the toric variety as\npatched local affine schemes Spec C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] instead of the global description via\nhomogeneous coordinates.

Since G permutes the 24 singularities of P\u2207 , one only has to consider one of them.\nFor example, the fixed point corresponding to the cone hp1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p19 , p20 i \u2208\nF\u2207 is\n\u0002\n\u0001\ns = 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : * * * : 1 : 0|{z}\n: 0 : 1 : * * * : 1] \u2208 Sing P\u2207 ,\n(38)\nPositions 19 and 20\n\nsee eq. (29). At the singular point,\nP0 (s) = 1,\n\nP\u221e (s) = 0.\n\n(39)\n\ne\u03c6 misses the singular point s.\nTherefore, a sufficiently generic hypersurface X\n2. On the maximal torus Phi none of the homogeneous coordinates is allowed to\nvanish. In particular,\nP\u221e (z) 6= 0 \u2200z \u2208 Phi\n(40)\nby eq. (33). Since all fixed points are contained in Phi , a sufficiently generic\ne\u03c6 misses the fixed points. For example, one can check that X\ne1\nhypersurface X\nmisses all fixed points.\n3. Finally, one has to check that the hypersurface equation is transverse. As in the\nend of Subsection 3.5, I will make \u0001use of the covering of the toric variety P\u2207 by\n24 affine patches Spec C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] corresponding to the generating cones. By\nsymmetry, one only has to check transversality in one of the 24 affine patches.\nIn the patch used for eq. (31), the two invariant polynomials read\nP\nP0 Spec C[\u03c3\u2228 \u2229M ] = 1 + 8i=1 xi +\nx1 x3 + x1 x5 + x2 x6 + x3 x7 + x 3 x5 + x6 x8 + x1 x3 x7 +\n\u0001\nx3 x6 x1 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x3 x6\nP\u221e\n\nSpec C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229M ]\n\n(41)\n\n= x3 x6 .\n\nA straightforward computation [25] yields that P1 = P0 + P\u221e is transverse.\nTherefore, any sufficiently generic P\u03c6 is transverse.\nThis proves that a generic hypersurface X\u03c6 is smooth. For example, X1 is smooth.\nThe (non-generic) hypersurfaces X0 and X\u221e are both singular because the special\npolynomials P0 and P\u221e fail to be transverse. Moreover, X0 has additional orbifold\ne0 passes through 12 out of the 16 g 2 -fixed points.8 Finally, X\u221e\nsingularities because X\n4\ne\u221e passes through the singular points of the\nhas an additional singularity because X\nambient toric variety. A complete description of the complex structure moduli space\nwill be given elsewhere [32].\n8\n\ne0 are the 4 fixed points of g4 .\nThe 4 points that are fixed by g42 and missed by X\n\n14\n\n\f4.2\n\nHodge Numbers\n\nA generic (not necessarily symmetric) Calabi-Yau hypersurface in the toric variety P\u2207\nhas Hodge numbers\n1\n0\n0\n0 20 0\n\u0001\ne = 1 20 20 1 .\nhpq X\n(42)\n0 20 0\n0\n0\n1\nUnsurprisingly, it is self-mirror (h11 = h21 ) since the 24-cell is a self-dual polytope.

By rewriting the Dolbeault cohomology and contracting with the covariant constant (3, 0)-form, the h21 complex structure moduli of\ne correspond to the tangent bundle-valued cohomology\nthe Calabi-Yau hypersurface X\ngroup\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne = H 1 X,\ne TX\ne .\ne = H 1 X,\ne \u22272 T \u2217 X\n(45)\nH 2,1 X\nNow, the tangent bundle is a subbundle of the tangent bundle of the ambient space\ne\nrestricted to X,\ne \u2212\u2192 T P\u2207 | e \u2212\u2192 O(\u2212K\u2207 )| e \u2212\u2192 0.\n0 \u2212\u2192 T X\nX\nX\n15\n\n(46)\n\n\fThis leads to the long exact sequence\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne O(\u2212K\u2207 )| e \u2212\u2192 H 1 X,\ne TX\ne \u2212\u2192 H 1 X,\ne T P\u2207 | e = 0\n* * * \u2212\u2192 H 0 X,\nX\nX\n\n(47)\n\nof cohomology groups, where I used the result for the tangent-bundle valued cohomology of the toric variety from Appendix A. We see that, to minimize the surviving\ne\ncomplex structure moduli on a free quotient X = X/G,\none needs to minimize the\nnumber of G-invariant sections of the anticanonical bundle.\nThe invariant sections of the (pull-back of the) anticanonical bundle are computed\nby the cohomology long exact sequence\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne O(\u2212K\u2207 )| e \u2212\u2192 0.\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 0 P\u2207 , O \u2212\u2192 H 0 P\u2207 , O(\u2212K\u2207 ) \u2212\u2192 H 0 X,\n(48)\nX\n{z\n}\n{z\n}\n|\n|\n'C\n\n'C\u2206\u2229M\n\nThe simplest group actions on toric varieties are toric actions, that is, subgroups of\nthe maximal torus. But for these to admit a fixed-point free action on a Calabi-Yau\nhypersurface is very rare [33]. In particular, there is no such action on P\u2207 . Given\nthat the toric group actions do not suffice, one is led to consider permutation actions\non the homogeneous coordinates coming from symmetries of the polytope. Note that\nthe group elements, represented by orthogonal matrices, act in the same way on the\ndual polytopes \u2207 \u2208 N and \u2206 \u2208 M in order to preserve the inner product. Since we\ncan identify\n\u0001\nH 0 P\u2207 , O(\u2212K\u2207 ) = C\u2206\u2229M\n(49)\nwith the integral points of the polytope \u2206, there are always at least two invariant\nsections of the anticanonical bundle: The section corresponding to the origin of M ,\nand the sum over one orbit of a vertex of \u2206. If the vertices form more than one orbit,\nthen there are more invariant sections. Hence, one is led to search for subgroups of\nAut(\u2206) = Weyl(F4 ) that act simply transitively,9 that is, with a single orbit of length\n24, on the vertices of \u2207. A quick computation [26] reveals that, up to conjugacy,\nthere are 22 different subgroups of order 24. Of these, 4 act simply transitively on the\nvertices. The groups are 2 subgroups isomorphic to SL(2, 3) that are not conjugate\nto each other, a semidirect10 product Z3 o Z8 with GAP id [24,1], and Z3 \u00d7 Q8 .\nThus far, I only showed that the group action would lead to h21 = 1 provided that\ne\nthe quotient X = X/G\nis smooth. But we are not guaranteed that it is smooth, and\none must check it case-by-case. However, note that the invariant equations for all of\nthese four group actions are the same, namely the one-parameter family P\u03c6 defined in\n9\n\nIt is, a priori, not impossible for groups with |G| > 24 to act freely. The group action can\nthen still be transitive but not simply transitive. Therefore, there is some g \u2208 G that fixes some\nindex i. The corresponding divisor zi = 0 is then mapped to itself by g, yet not forbidden by the\nStanley-Reisner ideal. Hence, we cannot as easily conclude that all fixed point sets are discrete.\n10\nTo fix notation, I will say that G is a semidirect product of N and H, written N o H, if there is\na group homomorphism G \u2192 H with kernel N . For example, SL(2, 3) can be written as a semidirect\nproduct SL(2, 3) = Q8 o Z3 .\n\n16\n\n\feq. (36). Hence, the covering Calabi-Yau manifold is always the same one-parameter\ne\u03c6 . We have already shown in Subsection 4.1 that a generic hypersurface does\nfamily X\nnot meet the ambient singularities and is transverse. Therefore, the covering space\ne\nis generically smooth and one only has to check that the group action is free on X.\nThat is, the fixed point set in P\u2207 must not meet the hypersurface for all g \u2208 G \u2212 {1}.\nDirect computation shows that the other SL(2, 3)-subgroup, that is the one we have\nnot used in Section 3, has fixed points.11 The remaining two groups have, like the first\nSL(2, 3), only isolated fixed points in the maximal torus and no fixed points outside\nof the maximal torus. Hence, all three groups act without fixed points on a generic\ne\nhypersurface X.\nTo summarize, there are really three different free quotients of a generic invariant\ne \u2282 P\u2207 . The three quotients Xi = X/G\ne i are Calabi-Yau manifolds\nhypersurface X\n11\n21\nwith the same Hodge numbers h = h = 1, but different fundamental groups. To\nremind ourselves, the first one was\nG1 = G = hg3 , g4 i ' SL(2, 3),\n\n(50)\n\nsee eq. (5) for the definition of the permutations g3 and g4 . The second group can be\nwritten as a semidirect product\nG2 = hg3 , g8 i ' Z3 o Z8\n\n(51)\n\nwith\ng8 def\n= (1, 2, 20, 12, 16, 15, 13, 5)(3, 10, 8, 11, 14, 7, 9, 6)(4, 19, 21, 22, 24, 23, 17, 18). (52)\nFinally, the third group can be written as a direct product\nG3 = hg3 , i, ji ' Z3 \u00d7 Q8\n\n(53)\n\nwith\ni =(1, 6, 16, 11)(2, 8, 15, 9)(3, 5, 14, 12)(4, 23, 24, 19)(7, 13, 10, 20)(17, 18, 21, 22),\n(54)\nj =(1, 7, 16, 10)(2, 3, 15, 14)(4, 22, 24, 18)(5, 8, 12, 9)(6, 20, 11, 13)(17, 23, 21, 19).\nThe three different groups have a common subgroup\nZ6 = hg3 , g42 i = G1 \u2229 G2 \u2229 G3\nwhich is normal in G2 and G3 , but not in G1 .\n11\n\ne in curves.\nIn fact, the other SL(2, 3)-action fixes surfaces in P\u2207 intersecting X\n\n17\n\n(55)\n\n\fh11 (XH )\n20\n12\n8\n6\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nh21 (XH )\n20\n12\n8\n6\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nH\n1\nZ2\nZ3\nZ4\nZ6\nZ8 , Q8\nZ12\nSL(2, 3), Z3 o Z8 , Z3 \u00d7 Q8\n\nTable 3: Fundamental groups \u03c01 (XH ) = H and Hodge numbers of the various\ne in the toric variety\nfree quotients of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface X\nP\u2207 .\n\n5.2\n\nSubgroups and Partial Quotients\n\ne have a various subgroups H,\nThe three freely acting groups G1 , G2 , and G3 on X\ne\neach of which acts freely and gives rise to another Calabi-Yau threefold XH = X/H.\nUp to conjugation, the subgroups are\nG1 \u2283 1, Z2 , Z3 , Z4 , Z6 , Q8 , SL(2, 3);\nG2 \u2283 1, Z2 , Z3 , Z4 , Z6 , Z8 , Z12 , Z3 o Z8 ;\nG3 \u2283 1, Z2 , Z3 ,\n\n(1)\nZ4 ,\n\n(2)\nZ4 ,\n\n(3)\nZ4 ,\n\nZ6 , Q8 ,\n\n(1)\nZ12 ,\n\n(56)\n(2)\nZ12 ,\n\n(3)\nZ12 ,\n\nZ3 \u00d7 Q8 .\n\nNote that G3 has three different Z4 and three different Z12 subgroups that are not\ne are not related by a\nconjugate to each other.

It turns out\ne only depends on the group, and not on the details\nthat the representation on H 1 (T X)\nof the permutation action.
