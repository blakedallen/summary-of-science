Introduction\nTrapped ions have featured prominently in the study of elementary quantum systems over a period of\nmany years. Some of the earliest experiments demonstrated the phenomenon of electron shelving or\nquantum jumps [1-3]. Subsequently, with improved methods of laser cooling [4-6], and through resolvedsideband Raman cooling [7,8] in particular, it became possible to prepare an ion in the ground state of a\nharmonic trap. Thus, a broad range of elementary quantum physics was opened up to experimental study\n[9], including the spectroscopy [10-12] and photon statistics [13-15] of single-atom resonance fluorescence;\nquantized Rabi oscillation and engineered quantum states of motion [16-18] (through a \"phonon\" analogy\nof the Jaynes-Cummings model); and quantum decoherence, specifically, of superpositions of motional\nstates [19,20]. Today, trapped ion systems continue to be developed as potential building blocks of\nquantum information processors [21-23].\nTheoretical work on the quantized motion of trapped ions has mostly considered small displacements\nfrom equilibrium-the so-called Lamb-Dicke regime [24]. It is common for the ion to be manipulated in\na standing-wave optical potential [25,26], in which case the potential is expanded to lowest order in the\nLamb-Dicke parameter\nr\nh\u0304\n2\u03c0\n\u03b7=\n,\n(1)\n\u03bb\n2m\u03c9T\np\nwhere \u03b7 is the ratio of the ion ground-state position uncertainty \u2206x =\nh\u0304/2m\u03c9T and the wavelength\nof the standing wave \u03bb (multiplied by 2\u03c0); m is the ion mass and \u03c9T the frequency. With the restriction\nto the Lamb-Dicke regime, in many situations only one, two, or possibly a few quanta of excitation are\nconsidered [16,17,27,28].\nThe assumption \u03b7 \u226a 1 is a feature of the semiclassical treatment of atomic motion in laser light as\nwell, where it underlies the diffusion or Fokker-Planck equation models [4,29-31]. These models assume\nthat significant change to the particle (ion) momentum is built up from very many individual momentum\n\"kicks\" (each of size h\u0304k = h/\u03bb) with the wavepacket well-localized on the scale of \u03bb; thus, in a harmonic\ntrap it is assumed that\n\u2206p/h\u0304k = (2k\u2206x)\u22121 = (2\u03b7)\u22121 \u226b 1.\n(2)\nSuch treatments also adiabatically eliminate the internal degrees of freedom, requiring the distance\ntraveled in an atomic lifetime \u03b3 \u22121 to be much less than \u03bb. This imposes the additional restriction\n(\u03c9T /\u03b3)x0 \u226a \u03bb,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere x0 is the amplitude of oscillation in the trap. Since, reasonably, x0 > \u2206x = \u03b7\u03bb/2\u03c0, from Eqs. (2)\nand (3), the recoil energy is constrained by\nh\u03042 k 2 /2m\n= \u03b7 2 \u03c9T /\u03b3 \u226a 2\u03c0\u03b7.\nh\u0304\u03b3\n\n(4)\n\n\fIn this paper we study the quantum motion of a trapped ion in laser light under conditions where none\nof the usual limitations and restrictions hold. Our aim is to exhibit the trapped ion system as an example\nof a quantum stochastic process in its fully elaborated form. Specifically, we consider an ion driven on a\ntwo-state electronic resonance by a standing-wave laser field-i.e., the heating of an ion through resonance\nfluorescence in a standing wave. Motion in one dimension is considered under the assumption of strong\ntransverse confinement. The following features are notable in relation to the limitations and restrictions\nabove:\n(i) heating rather than cooling of the ion takes place; thus, beginning in the ground state of the trap,\nthe amplitude of oscillation grows to eventually extend over many periods of the standing wave,\nwhere energies (depending on \u03b7) as high as 104 h\u0304\u03c9T \u2212 105 h\u0304\u03c9T are reached; thus, quantum motion\nwell outside the Lamb-Dicke regime is considered;\n(ii) we focus upon the case\n\u03c9T /\u03b3 = 1,\n\n(5)\n\nso inequality (3) is violated at relatively small amplitudes of oscillation; a crucial interplay develops\nbetween the coherent evolution of the center-of-mass and internal degrees of freedom; even when a\ndiffusion paradigm fits (for sufficiently small \u03b7), the motion is not understandable as diffusion in a\nprescribed harmonic plus optical potential;\n(iii) strong laser excitation, with Rabi frequency\n\u03a9/\u03b3 = 2,\n\n(6)\n\nis considered, but due to the interplay just noted the dressed-atom approach to atomic motion in\nlaser light [32] cannot be used; modulation of the Rabi frequency by the harmonic center-of-mass\nmotion plays a central role;\n(iv) Lamb-Dicke parameters ranging from \u03b7 = 0.2 to \u03b7 = 3.0 are considered, thus demonstrating the\ntransition from a quasi-classical dynamic, for \u03b7 \u226a 1, to a manifestly quantum stochastic dynamic\nwhen \u03b7 > 1; this transition is similar to that from weak- to strong-coupling in the treatment of\nquantum noise in cavity QED [33].\nThe reported investigation makes use of full quantum trajectory simulations [34], quantizing both\nthe internal and the center-of-mass degrees of freedom. As an aid to understanding, approximate,\nsemi-quantum trajectory simulations are explored as well, where the center-of-mass motion is treated\nclassically apart from the inclusion of momentum \"kicks\" coordinated with the fluorescence. There have\nbeen previous quantum trajectory (Monte Carlo wave-function [35]) simulations of atomic motion in laser\nlight [36-38], but all, to our knowledge, were carried out for conditions satisfying the restrictions of\nEqs. (2)\u2013(4).\nWe begin in Sec. 2 with an overview, presenting a summary of results in the form of heating curves\n(mean energy of the ion as a function of time) calculated for a series of Lamb-Dicke parameters ranging\nbetween \u03b7 = 0.2 and \u03b7 = 3.0. Results calculated from semi-quantum and quantum trajectories are\ncompared and a number of differences identified for explanation in subsequent sections. The equations\nunderlying the Monte-Carlo simulations are presented in Sec. 3, where we demonstrate a surprising\nfeature of the individual realizations of the stochastic process; a stepwise evolution of the amplitude of\noscillation of the ion is observed, pointing to the existence of a series of metastable amplitudes on which\nthe ion heating almost stops. In Sec. 4 the origin of this evolution is identified as frequency modulation\nof the internal state Rabi oscillation. The metastable amplitudes of oscillation are identified with zeros of\nthe J0 Bessel function and characterized by the mean waiting time for fluorescent scattering plotted as a\nfunction of the amplitude of oscillation in the trap. A phase-space diffusion model is derived that recovers\nthe heating curves of Sec. 2 in the limit of small Lamb-Dicke parameters, and quantitative differences\nbetween the semi-quantum and quantum diffusion are explained. Finally, in Sec. 5, Lamb-Dicke\nparameters of order unity are considered, where differences between a diffusion and a jump process\nare revealed. Here semi-quantum and quantum trajectory models are qualitatively different in their\npredictions. An observed quantum suppression of the ion heating rate is explained by the delocalization\nof the center-of-mass wavepacket across the standing wave.\n\n\f2. Quantum and semi-quantum heating rates\nWe consider an ion of mass m trapped harmonically in one dimension with trap frequency \u03c9T . A classical\nlaser field resonantly excites a closed two-state electronic transition of the ion, with decay rate \u03b3 and Rabi\nfrequency \u03a9; parameters chosen as in Eqs. (5) and (6). The laser field forms a standing wave along the\naxis of the ion motion (wavelength \u03bb) and the equilibrium of the potential is located at an anti-node of the\nstanding wave.\nFigure 1 shows the growth of the mean-squared amplitude of oscillation of the ion-measured in wavelengths [see Eqs. (20) and (21)]-as a function of time for various Lamb-Dicke parameters \u03b7. Two separate\nmodels were used to compute these results as ensemble averages over Monte-Carlo simulations of the ion\nheating through fluorescence. For the results of Fig. 1(a), the ion center-of-mass position and momentum\nare treated as classical variables, but with a momentum \"kick\" added when a laser photon is scattered; the\nscattering is simulated as a quantum trajectory for a two-state system with a definite, though oscillating,\nposition within the standing wave [34-37,39]. For the results of Fig. 1(b), full quantum trajectory\nsimulations were carried out with both the center-of-mass and internal degrees of freedom quantized. The\nfollowing points are of note and will be elaborated upon in the following sections:\n(i) for small Lamb-Dicke parameters both sets of results approach a limit where the heating curve\nbecomes independent of \u03b7, apart from a factor \u03b7 4 that may be absorbed in the scaling of time; in\nthis limit the heating is well-described by a diffusion in phase-space;\n(ii) semi-quantum and quantum trajectory models disagree quantitatively in the diffusion limit\n[compare the thinest curves in Figs. 1(a) and (b)];\n(iii) larger Lamb-Dicke parameters yield an \u03b7-dependence over and above the scaling of time by \u03b7 4 ; thus,\ndifferences between a quantum jump and diffusion process become explicitly apparent;\n(iv) for large Lamb-Dicke parameters the two sets of curves are qualitatively different; the semi-quantum\ntrajectories [frame (a)] show a heating rate that increases monotonically with increasing \u03b7, while the\nfull quantum trajectory results [frame (b)] eventually show a dramatic reduction of the heating rate.\nBefore taking up these four themes, we first present the mathematical details of our two models in\nSec. 3. Then we explore individual realizations of the quantum stochastic heating of the ion. These\nexhibit a very interesting evolution of the amplitude of oscillation of the ion in the trap, an underlying\nstructure to the stochastic dynamics quite unanticipated on the basis of the ensemble averages displayed in\nFig. 1.\n\n12\n(a)\nA2\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n\u22123\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b7 \u03b3t \u00d7 10\n\nFig. 1.

Monte-Carlo simulations\n3.1 Semi-quantum trajectories:\nSemi-quantum trajectories treat the center-of-mass motion of the ion classically. Only the electronic states\nof the ion are quantized. We represent the center-of-mass state by the point in phase-space\nr\n\u0014\n\u0015\np(t)\nm\u03c9T\n\u03b1(t) = \u03b1\u0303(t)e\u2212i\u03c9T t =\nx(t) + i\n,\n(7)\n2h\u0304\nm\u03c9T\nwhere x(t) denotes the oscillator position and p(t) its momentum. The trajectory equations are\nformulated in a rotating frame, with \u03b1\u0303(t) denoting the complex amplitude of the oscillation. Following\nthe standard quantum trajectory treatment of resonance fluorescence (see Sec. 8.2 of Ref. [34]), the\nconditional internal state of the ion is expanded in the interaction picture as\n|\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i = c\u0304(\u2212) (t)|\u2212i + c\u0304(+) (t)|+i,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere |\u2212i and |+i are, respectively, the ground and excited electronic states, and the label REC refers\nto the conditioning of the state on the scattering record prior to time t; ket vectors and Schr\u00f6dinger\namplitudes with an overbar, as in Eq. (8), are unnormalized. Under the assumed resonant excitation,\nin between photon scattering events, the (unnormalized) Schr\u00f6dinger amplitudes obey the equations of\nmotion\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\ndc\u0304(\u2212)\n= \u2212(\u03a9/2) cos \u03b7 \u03b1\u0303e\u2212i\u03c9T t + \u03b1\u0303\u2217 ei\u03c9T t c\u0304(+) ,\ndt\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\ndc\u0304(+)\n\u03b3\n= (\u03a9/2) cos \u03b7 \u03b1\u0303e\u2212i\u03c9T t + \u03b1\u0303\u2217 ei\u03c9T t c\u0304(\u2212) \u2212 c\u0304(+) ,\ndt\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, importantly, the Rabi frequency \u03a9 is modulated by the harmonic motion of the ion through the\nstanding wave-using Eqs. (1) and (7), cos[kx(t)] = cos{\u03b7[\u03b1(t) + \u03b1\u2217 (t)]}. Photon scattering is accounted\nfor through quantum jumps, which interrupt this coherent evolution. The jumps occur at random times,\nwith instantaneous rate\n|c\u0304(+) (t)|2\n.\n(10)\nRjump (t) = \u03b3 (\u2212) 2\n|c\u0304 (t)| + |c\u0304(+) (t)|2\nEach jump returns the ion to the ground electronic state,\nc\u0304\u2212 \u2192 c\u0304+ ,\n\nc\u0304+ \u2192 0,\n\n(11a)\n\nand at the same time we add a momentum \"kick\" to the center-of-mass. The magnitude of this \"kick\" is\ndetermined by projecting the recoil for photon scattering in a randomly chosen direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) onto the\nline of the ion motion; thus, for photon scattering at time t, we implement a momentum \"kick\" in the\nrotating frame through the semi-quantum jump\n\u03b1\u0303 \u2192 \u03b1\u0303 + i\u03b7 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6ei\u03c9T t ,\n\n(11b)\n\nwhich follows from the magnitude of the recoil h\u0304k and Eqs. (1) and (7). The angle \u03c6 is uniformly\ndistributed between 0 and 2\u03c0, while \u03b8 is distributed according to the dipole radiation pattern (oriented\nperpendicular to the ion motion).\nA Monte-Carlo simulation must decide at each time step whether to propagate the internal state\naccording to Eq. (9), leaving \u03b1\u0303 unchanged, or to implement the quantum and semi-quantum jumps,\nEqs. (11a) and (11b); the branching ratio is given by the jump probability Rjump \u2206t. When a jump\n(photon scattering) does occur, two random numbers determine the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6. The heating of the\nion results from the accumulated momentum \"kicks\" (11b). The mechanism is therefore, in principle,\nstraightforward. It is important to note, however, that the \"kick\" rate is not a fixed function of either\nspace or time, but itself evolves stochastically according to Eqs. (9) and (10). This gives rise to an\nunanticipated complexity in the ion motion, as illustrated in Sec. 3.4.\n\n\f3.2 Quantum trajectories:\nThe full quantum trajectory treatment of the ion heating is formulated as a natural extension of Eqs. (8)\u2013\n(11b). The principle difference is that Schr\u00f6dinger amplitudes c\u0304(\u2212) (t) and c\u0304(+) (t) are replaced by centerof-mass ket vectors, with the expansion of the total quantum state, quantized internal and center-of-mass\ndegrees of freedom,\n(\u2212)\n\n(+)\n\n|\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i = |\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i|\u2212i + |\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i|+i.\n\n(12)\n\nThe coupled equations of motion (9) for Schr\u00f6dinger amplitudes are replaced by coupled equations of\nmotion for the (unnormalized) center-of-mass kets,\n(\u2212)\n\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003 (+)\nd|\u03c8\u0304REC i\n= \u2212(\u03a9/2) cos \u03b7 \u00e2e\u2212i\u03c9T t + \u00e2\u2020 ei\u03c9T t |\u03c8\u0304REC i,\ndt\n(+)\n\n\u0001\u0003 (\u2212)\n\u0002\nd|\u03c8\u0304REC i\n\u03b3 (+)\n= (\u03a9/2) cos \u03b7 \u00e2e\u2212i\u03c9T t + \u00e2\u2020 ei\u03c9T t |\u03c8\u0304REC i \u2212 |\u03c8\u0304REC i,\ndt\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are oscillator annihilation and creation operators, and replace the classical phase-space\nvariables \u03b1\u0303 and \u03b1\u0303\u2217 . In line with the rotating frame of reference used in Eqs. (7) and (9), the interaction\npicture of the harmonic oscillator has been adopted in Eqs. (12) and (13). The jump (photon scattering)\nrate is calculated from the center-of-mass ket norms in a straightforward generalization of Eq.

(13)\u2013(15) in essentially the same\nmanner as before. The numerical demands are significantly higher, though, due to the much larger\nnumber basis states involved. The two center-of-mass kets are expanded in the energy representation of\nthe harmonic oscillator, and we have, in fact, carried out simulations where the energy of the center-ofmass motion rises to be of the order of 104 h\u0304\u03c9T \u2212 105 h\u0304\u03c9T . This is achieved by carrying out the\ncalculations in a local frame that tracks the average complex amplitude of the oscillation, h\u00e2(t)iREC ,\nreached at the conclusion of a quantum jump. This strategy also circumvents the need to explicitly\nimplement the displacement in Eq. (15).\n3.3 Quantum trajectories in the local frame:\nWe absorb the mean displacement of the center-of-mass kets from one quantum jump to another into a\nchange of the frame of reference. Thus, we work with the displaced center-of-mass kets,\n(\u00b1)\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n|\u03c8\u0304local (t)i = D\u0302[\u2212\u03b1\u0303(t)]|\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere D\u0302[\u2212\u03b1\u0303(t)] displaces the center-of-mass state to a \"local frame\". The local frame changes in time,\ndiscontinuously, at the times of the quantum jumps. When it has been decided that a photon scattering\nis to take place and the associated quantum jump (15) is to be executed, a displacement of the post-jump\nkets is made to first cancel the displacement of the momentum \"kick\" [Eq. (15)], and second to move the\nmean complex amplitude of the oscillator back to zero-i.e., to off-set any change in the mean brought\nabout by the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution during the interval that has elapsed since the last quantum jump.\nThen in place of Eqs. (13) we have equations of motion for the ket vectors in the local frame,\n(\u2212)\n\n\u0003\n\b \u0002\nd|\u03c8\u0304local i\n(+)\n= \u2212(\u03a9/2) cos \u03b7 (\u03b1\u0303 + \u00e2)e\u2212i\u03c9T t + (\u03b1\u0303\u2217 + \u00e2\u2020 )ei\u03c9T t |\u03c8\u0304local i,\ndt\n(+)\n\n\u0003\n\b \u0002\nd|\u03c8\u0304local i\n\u03b3 (+)\n(\u2212)\n= (\u03a9/2) cos \u03b7 (\u03b1\u0303 + \u00e2)e\u2212i\u03c9T t + (\u03b1\u0303\u2217 + \u00e2\u2020 )ei\u03c9T t |\u03c8\u0304local i \u2212 |\u03c8\u0304local i,\ndt\n2\n(17)\n\n\fwith jump rate\n(+)\n\nRjump (t) = \u03b3\n\n(\u2212)\n\n(+)\n\nh\u03c8\u0304local (t)|\u03c8\u0304local (t)i\n\n(\u2212)\n\n(+)\n\n(+)\n\nh\u03c8\u0304local (t)|\u03c8\u0304local (t)i + h\u03c8\u0304localC (t)|\u03c8\u0304local (t)i\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThe quantum jump is now executed by setting the mean oscillator amplitude with respect to the local\nframe to zero (and setting the ion in the ground electronic state), with\n(\u2212)\n\n(+)\n\n|\u03c8\u0304local i \u2192 D\u0302(\u2212h\u00e2ilocal )|\u03c8\u0304local i,\n\n(+)\n\n|\u03c8\u0304local i \u2192 0,\n\n(19a)\n\nand moving the location of the local relative to the global frame, with\n\u03b1\u0303 \u2192 \u03b1\u0303 + h\u00e2ilocal + i\u03b7 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6ei\u03c9T t .\n\n(19b)\n\nIn these expression h\u00e2ilocal is the conditional oscillator amplitude expectation calculated in the pre-jump\nlocal frame.\n3.4 Sample results:\nFigure 2 presents examples of the simulated trajectories for four different values of the Lamb-Dicke\nparameter, increasing from \u03b7 = 0.2 in frame (a) to \u03b7 = 2.2 in frame (d). We plot the amplitude of\noscillation, measured in optical wavelengths, against time in atomic lifetimes scaled by \u03b7 4 (see Sec. 4.2).\nExplicitly, for semi-quantum trajectories, using Eqs. (1) and (7), the amplitude is given by\nr\n1\n\u03b7\n2h\u0304\nA=\n|\u03b1\u0303| = |\u03b1\u0303|,\n(20)\n\u03bb m\u03c9T\n\u03c0\nwhile for quantum trajectories\nA=\n\n\u03b7\n\u03c0\n\nq\nq\n\u03b7\nh\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2iREC =\nh(\u03b1\u0303\u2217 + \u00e2\u2020 )(\u03b1\u0303 + \u00e2)ilocal .\n\u03c0\n\n(21)\n\nThere are two principal points of interest to be noted in the figure. First, frames (a) and (b) shown a clear\nstep-like evolution, which is at least qualitatively similar in the semi-quantum and quantum simulations.\nLong periods of almost no heating at all (metastable amplitudes) are present, interspersed with periods\nof much more rapid heating, thus making up the steps. Quantitatively, periods of essentially no heating\nare observed to last as long as 106 lifetimes, while the metastable amplitudes are spaced approximately\n\u03bb/2 apart-at A = 0.38, 0.88, 1.38, etc.. Second, the similarity between semi-quantum and quantum\ntrajectories seems to be breaking down in fames (c) and (d). The quantum trajectory shows no clear steps\nin frame (d), while the stepping of the semi-quantum trajectory no longer keeps to the metastable\namplitudes identified before. The task of the following sections is to explain these features along with\npoints (i)\u2013(iv) of Sec. 2.\n\nFig. 2. Sample quantum (thick curves) and semi-quantum (thin curves) trajectory simulations of the amplitude of\noscillation in the trap; for Lamb-Dicke parameters \u03b7 = 0.2 (a), 0.8 (b), 1.4 (c), and 2.2 (d).\n\n\f4. Mean waiting times and the diffusion limit\n4.1 Semi-quantum waiting times:\nAn explanation of the step-like evolution of Figs. 2(a) and (b) is provided by Fig. 3. Here, in the upper\nseries of pictures, we plot the induced Rabi oscillation and simulated photon scattering sequence for four\ndifferent amplitudes of oscillation in the trap. For simplicity, only Semi-quantum trajectories are considered in this section. Frames (a) and (c) show the ion being fully excited, while (b) and (d) show much\nlower levels of excitation. The corresponding numbers of scattered photons are high-frames (a) and (c)-\nand much lower-frames (b) and (d). Evidently, the response of the ion to the modulated driving field\n[Eqs. (9)],\n(\u03a9/2) cos[kx(t)] = (\u03a9/2) cos{2\u03c0A cos[\u03c9T t \u2212 arg(\u03b1\u0303)]},\n\n(22)\n\ndepends strongly on the amplitude of oscillation in the trap. The observation is readily understood from\nthe time-averaged Rabi frequency, \u03a9J0 (2\u03c0A), which is zero at the zeros of the J0 Bessel function. The\nfirst two of these zeros occur at the amplitudes A = 0.38 and A = 0.88 of frames (b) and (d) in the figure,\nwhile amplitudes A = 0.0 and A = 0.6 [frames (a) and (c)] correspond to local maxima of the Bessel\nfunction. Thus, the metastable amplitudes are located by the zeros of J0 (2\u03c0A), where the ion is only\nweakly excited and the fluorescence rate drops. Of course, some photon scattering occurs at these zeros,\nsince the actual response is to the modulated driving and not to its time average; the amount decreases as\nA increases, as seen in the comparison between frames (b) and (d).\n\nFig. 3. Semi-quantum Rabi oscillation and photon scattering sequence (upper frames) and corresponding waitingtime distribution (lower frames) for four different amplitudes of oscillation in the trap: A = 0.0 (a), 0.38 (b), 0.6\n(c), and 0.88 (d).\n\nA useful way to quantify the behavior as a function of A is through the distribution of times waited\nbetween two successive scattering events (quantum jumps)-the so-called waiting-time distribution. This\ndistribution is plotted for semi-quantum trajectories in the lower series of pictures in Fig. 3, where it is\nnarrow (width of order \u03b3\u03c4 = 1) in frames (a) and (c), significantly broadened in frame (b), and broader\nstill in frame (d). The distribution depends, most generally, on both the amplitude, A, and phase,\n\u03b6 = \u03c9T t \u2212 arg(\u03b1\u0303),\n\n(23)\n\nof the oscillation in the trap at the time of the quantum jump that begins the interval waited \u03c4 . The\nquantity plotted in Fig. 3 has been averaged over \u03b6. For given amplitude and phase, the waiting-time\ndistribution is computed within quantum trajectory theory as [39]\nW (\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) = \u03b3|c\u0304(+) (t + \u03c4 )|2 ,\n\n(24)\n\n,\n\n\fwhere c\u0304(+) (t + \u03c4 ) satisfies Eqs. (9) with initial condition c\u0304(+) (t) = 0, c\u0304(\u2212) (t) = 1. Its mean,\n\u03c4\u0304 (A, \u03b6) =\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 \u03c4 W (\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6),\n\n(25)\n\n0\n\nis sufficient to characterize the metastable states. For semi-quantum trajectories, an approximate\nanalytical expression for this mean can be derived as follows.\nThe task is to solve Eqs. (9) with the initial internal state the electronic ground state. We first make a\ntransformation to consider the complex variable\nc\u0304(\u2212) (t + \u03c4 ) + ic\u0304(+) (t + \u03c4 ) = B(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6)ei\u03b2(\u03c4 ;A,\u03b6) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere B(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) and \u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) are real functions of \u03c4 . The equations of motion for Schr\u00f6dinger\namplitudes, Eqs. (9), then yield a solution in the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03b3 \u03c4 \u2032 2\nB(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) = exp \u2212\nd\u03c4 sin \u03b2(\u03c4 \u2032 ; A, \u03b6) ,\n2 0\n\n(27)\n\nwith the phase \u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) satisfying the equation\n\u03b3\nd\u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6)\n= \u2212(\u03a9/2) cos [2\u03c0A cos(\u03c9T \u03c4 + \u03b6)] \u2212 sin\u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6).\nd\u03c4\n4\n\n(28)\n\nFrom Eqs.

We now introduce an approximation which holds good\nwhenever the mean waiting time is much larger than \u03b3 \u22121 . Assuming \u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) is very small, such that\nsin \u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) \u2248 \u03b2(\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6), Eq.

We then replace\n\u03b2 2 (\u03c4 ; A, \u03b6) in Eq. (31) by its d.c. component (which is independent of the phase \u03b6), and from Eqs. (29)\u2013\n(31), the waiting-time distribution is approximated by the exponential distribution\nW (\u03c4 ; A) = \u03c4\u0304 \u22121 e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4\u0304 (A) ,\n\n(33)\n\nwith mean waiting time\n\u221e\n2\n2\nX\nJ2n\n(2\u03c0A) + J\u22122n\n(2\u03c0A)\n\u03b3 \u03c4\u0304 (A) = (\u03a9/2)\n2\n(\u03b3/2)\n+\n(2n\u03c9\n)2\nT\nn=0\n\n\"\n\n2\n\n#\u22121\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\n\fNote how the dominant term in the series expansion of \u03b3 \u03c4\u0304 vanishes for the identified metastable\namplitudes-when J0 (2\u03c0A) = 0. The approximation (34) is compared with the exact result computed\nfrom a semi-quantum trajectory average in Fig. 4. The two results are in remarkably good agreement\neverywhere except for amplitudes A < 1 and in a narrow range of amplitudes in between the peaks.\nWe see that with increasing center-of-mass energy, the rate of photon scattering on the metastable\namplitudes very quickly drops by more than two orders of magnitude. Clearly this interplay of the\ncoherent oscillation of the ion in the trap and the induced Rabi oscillation must be the principal\ndeterminant of the heating curves-for small Lamb-Dicke parameters at least-and of the noted\ndifferences between semi-quantum and quantum models (Fig. 1).\n350\n16\n8\n0\n0\n\n\u03b3\u03c4 175\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nFig. 4. Exact (thick curve) and approximate [Eq. (34)] (thin curve) semiquantum mean waiting time plotted as a function of the amplitude of\noscillation in the trap.\n\n4.2 The semi-quantum diffusion limit:\nPoint (i) in Sec. 2 is concerned with the approach of the heating curves for small \u03b7 to a diffusion limit. It\nwas noted that the \u03b7-dependence in this limit amounts to a scaling of the time by \u03b7 4 . We are now in a\nposition to elaborate upon these observations. We treat the diffusion limit for semi-quantum trajectories\nfirst, then compare the description for quantum trajectories in the following section.\nIt is convenient to use a set of coordinates rotated to remove the phase of the complex amplitude \u03b1\u0303. In\nthis frame of reference, the momentum \"kick\" defined by Eq. (11b) is written as [\u03b6 defined by Eq. (23)]\n\u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6) = \u2206k (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6) + i\u2206\u22a5 (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6) = i\u03b7 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6ei\u03b6 ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u2206k (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6) is a \"kick\" in the amplitude of \u03b1\u0303 and \u2206\u22a5 (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6) is a \"kick\" in its phase. Successive\n\"kicks\" are distributed randomly, though not necessarily uniformly, over the angles \u03b8, \u03c6, and \u03b6. Taking an\naverage over these distributions yields a covariance matrix that depends only on the amplitude of\noscillation in the trap A:\n\u22062k (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6)\n\n\u2206k (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6)\u2206\u22a5 (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6)\n\n\u2206k (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6)\u2206\u22a5 (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6)\n\n\u22062\u22a5 (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6)\n\nT\n\nC(A) = B(A)B (A) =\n\n!\n\n. (36)\n\nThe covariance matrix defines the r.m.s. size of the phase-space \"kicks\". It is plotted from a simulated\ntrajectory average in Fig. 5. To this information we add their average rate-i.e., the inverse of the mean\nwaiting time plotted in Fig. 4, also a function only of A. Assuming, then, that the phase-space \"kicks\", of\norder \u03b7 [Eq. (35)], are small, so that significant changes in \u03b1\u0303 accumulate over very many photon scattering\nevents, we may put these pieces of information together to arrive at the stochastic differential equation\nwith amplitude-dependent diffusion\n\u0012\n\nd\u03b1\u0303k\nR[\u2212 arg(\u03b1\u0303)]\nd\u03b1\u0303\u22a5\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\ndWk\nB(A)\n= p\ndW\n\u03c4\u0304 (A)\n\u22a5\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(37)\n\n\fwhere the rotation matrix R[\u2212 arg(\u03b1\u0303)] brings the phase-space increments back to the original coordinate\nsystem; dWk and dW\u22a5 are independent Wiener increments, with covariances\ndWk dWk = dW\u22a5 dW\u22a5 = dt,\n\n0.4\n\ndWk dW\u22a5 = 0.\n\n(38)\n\n0.2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nC\u03bc\u03bd/\u03b7 2 0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nFig. 5. Semi-quantum covariance matrix elements plotted as a function of the amplitude of oscillation in\nthe trap: (a) amplitude (thick curve) and phase (thin curve) quadrature variances; (b) amplitude-phase\ncross-correlation.\n\nThe noted \u03b7 4 -scaling of the time axis in the diffusion limit [point (i) of Sec. 2] follows directly from\nEq. (35)\u2013(37). Note first that B(A) \u223c \u03b7, while, in addition, the oscillation amplitude in wavelengths is\nrelated to the phase-space amplitude by A = \u03b7|\u03b1\u0303|/\u03c0 [Eq. (20)]; thus, after multiplying Eq. (37) by \u03b7/\u03c0,\nthe right-hand side is of order \u03b7 2 and the fluctuation variance, at fixed A, grows as \u03b7 4 t.\nWe find that the diffusion model agrees with semi-quantum jump simulations for Lamb-Dicke\nparameters on the order of \u03b7 = 0.2 or less; in fact, there is very little difference for \u03b7 = 0.4 [results for\n\u03b7 = 0.2 and 0.4 are indistinguishable in Fig. 1(a)]. Further increase, however, brings noticeably faster\nsemi-quantum heating, as shown by the curves for \u03b7 = 0.8, 1.4, 2.2, and 2.6 in Fig. 1(a) [point (iii) of\nSec. 2]. In this regime the scale of the individual quantum events (momentum \"kicks\") approaches that\nof the underlying phase-space structure represented by the peaks in Fig. 4. A handful of jumps can\ndestabilize the metastable amplitudes much faster than the diffusion process can.\n4.3 Quantum trajectories compared:\nSemi-quantum trajectories are conceptually simple and provide a convenient starting point for our\nunderstanding. They are nevertheless a rather gross approximation. Points (ii) and (iv) of Sec. 2 record\ntwo instances where the approximation has a significant effect upon the heating rate. Considering first\nthe quantitative difference in the diffusion limit [point (ii)], we might ask how the mean waiting time and\ncovariance matrix change as functions of the amplitude of oscillation A. The mean waiting time computed\nfrom full quantum trajectories is plotted in Fig. 6. For a Lamb-Dicke parameter of \u03b7 = 0.1 it is almost\nindistinguishable from the semi-quantum result. At larger values of \u03b7, however, differences set in: there is\na gradual smoothing out of the peaks, which is noticeable for \u03b7 = 0.2 and virtually complete for \u03b7 = 1.4.\nThis development is explained in Sec. 5.\nChanges to the covariance matrix are more relevant for the diffusion (small \u03b7) limit. Here the most\nimportant point to note is the difference between Eqs. (11a) and (19a). The former specifies the semiquantum phase-space \"kick\", while the latter adds to this the local-frame displacement of the center-ofmass wavepacket, h\u00e2ilocal , which occurs during the elapsed waiting time following the last quantum jump.\nWe might refer to this as the stochastic dipole-force displacement . It arises from the direct action of the\nstanding-wave light field on the center-of-mass of the ion. Since resonant excitation constitutes a\nnonperturbative interaction, it is not possible to extract an optical potential to account for this.\nNevertheless, to add to the momentum \"kicks\" from fluorescence, there is also momentum exchanged\nbetween the standing-wave laser field and the ion; this the semi-quantum model omits, while quantum\n(\u2212)\n(+)\ntrajectories include it as a time evolution of the center-of-mass kets-|\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i and |\u03c8\u0304REC (t)i-taking\nplace in between the quantum jumps [Eqs. (17)].\n\n\f320\n240\n120\n0\n2.2\n\n\u03b3\u03c4 160\n\n2.6\n\n3.0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nFig. 6.

The\ntallest curve (thinest line) is the exact semi-quantum result plotted in\nFig. 4.\n\nFrom Eq. (19b), when characterizing the individual quantum events for quantum trajectories, we\nreplace Eq. (35) by\n\u2032\n\n\u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 ) = |h\u00e2ilocal |ei\u03b6 + i\u03b7 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6ei\u03b6 ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere a dependence enters upon the additional relative phase\n\n\u03b6 \u2032 = arg(h\u00e2ilocal ) \u2212 arg(\u03b1\u0303).\n\n(40)\n\nThe covariance matrix is defined as before, with real and imaginary components of \u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 ) resolved\nin amplitude and phase directions, but now an average over the four phases \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 is taken. The\nnumerically computed result is displayed in Fig. 7. Its principal difference when compared to Fig. 5 is that\nthe phase variance peaks on the metastable amplitudes to reach a value an order of magnitude larger than\nin the semi-quantum case. Other less obvious changes are observed; for example, the amplitude variance\nalso increases to produce a broad background near each metastable amplitude-the likely cause of the\nnoted larger heating rate [point (ii) of Sec. 2].\nThe peaking of the phase variance on the metastable amplitudes appears most dramatically when\nphase-space plots are made. Sample plots are shown in Fig. 8, where we plot the complex amplitude \u03b1\u0303\nfrom semi-quantum simulations (second column in the figure) and h\u00e2iREC from quantum simulations\n(third column). In the diffusion limit (\u03b7 = 0.2), the phase diffusion on the metastable amplitudes\nproduces a dramatic \"bulls-eye\" pattern for quantum trajectories (top right frame), in sharp contrast\n\n16\n\n1\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nC\u03bc\u03bd \u00d710 2 8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nA\nFig. 7.

Sample semi-quantum (second column) and quantum (third column) trajectory simulations compared\nthrough plots of the complex oscillator amplitude in phase space; for Lamb-Dicke parameters \u03b7 = 0.2 (a), 0.8 (b),\n1.4 (c), and 2.2 (d). The first column reproduces the plots from Fig. 2.\n\nto the semi-quantum result. The phase diffusion is still in evidence for \u03b7 = 0.8 (second row), but gradually\nceases to be a feature as \u03b7 is further increased and the diffusion picture breaks down.\nOur final comment on the comparison between semi-quantum and quantum trajectories for small\nLamb-Dicke parameters is illustrated by Fig. 9. Quantum trajectories provide a quantum description of\nthe center-of-mass state-they evolve a center-of-mass wavepacket. What, then, is the form of this state?\nPerhaps we can expect a good approximation to a minimum uncertainty state, which is the closest\nquantum mechanical representation of the phase-space point of Eq. (7). As it turns out, this is not the\ncase, even for the smallest Lamb-Dicke parameters considered (though for sufficiently small \u03b7 we might\nstill expect that result). The states shown as Q functions in Fig. 9 were recovered for a Lamb-Dicke\nparameter \u03b7 = 0.2. They illustrate a generally observed amplitude squeezing, with large squeezing in\nthe vicinity of the metastable amplitudes and significantly less squeezing at amplitudes in between. The\ndegree of squeezing-of the conditional (instantaneously sampled) wavepacket-is plotted as a function of\nthe amplitude of oscillation in the trap in the frame to the right in the figure.\nWe propose the following quantum measurement interpretation of these results. The ion fluorescence\nmay be viewed as the record of an imperfect measurement, one revealing information about the amplitude\nof oscillation in the trap. Most simply, if the fluorescence rate is low, the ion likely oscillates with one\nof the metastable amplitudes; if high, with some amplitude midway in between. Beyond this simplest\nstatement, a more quantitative deduction about the actual amplitude of oscillation may be made on the\nbasis of the correlation between fluorescence rate and oscillation amplitude given in Figs. 4 and 6. The\nimportant point to note is that the amplitude discrimination achieved is especially high in the vicinity of\na metastable amplitude and significantly poorer in between. Where the discrimination is high, the centerof-mass wavepacket becomes squeezed so that its predicted uncertainty in the amplitude of oscillation is\nconsistent with the data made available though the measurement record (fluorescence)\u2013i.e. the squeezing\n\n\fFig. 9. Squeezing of the center-of-mass wavepacket as a function of the amplitude of oscillation in the trap. The\nscattered photons may be detected and read as the signal of an imperfect measurement of the amplitude A. Near\na metastable amplitude, the discrimination of the measurement is very good and the center-of-mass wavepacket\nbecomes squeezed so as to be consistent with the record read (Q function on the lower left); in between the\nmetastable amplitudes the discrimination, consequently the squeezing, is not so good (Q function on the upper\nleft). To the right, amplitude (thick curve) and phase (thin curve) quadrature variances are plotted as a function\nof the amplitude of oscillation in the trap. All results are for a Lamb-Dicke parameter \u03b7 = 0.2.\n\nmay be view as the product of a dynamical \"collapse of the wavepacket\", which in the case of a near-ideal\nmeasurement would produce an amplitude eigenstate.\n5. Quantum inhibition of fluorescence and the limit of large quantum jumps\nPoints (iii) and (iv) of Sec. 2 note that large Lamb-Dicke parameters yield an \u03b7-dependence in the heating\ncurves of Fig. 1 over and above the \u03b7 4 -scaling of the time axis-the dependence arising from the diffusion\nlimit. Point (iv) notes, in particular, that the quantum heating rate decreases for large \u03b7, while the\nincrease seen for semi-quantum trajectories seems more reasonable, when, due to their increased size, just\na few momentum \"kicks\" are sufficient to \"skip over\" (destabilize) the metastable amplitudes. In fact, the\nlowered heating rate is caused by a suppression of fluorescence of an entirely different (to the mechanism\nof Sec. 4) quantum mechanical origin, as we now explain.\nConsider, for example, the matrix elements for excitation of the ion out of the ground electronic state\nand the ground state of the trap while absorbing one photon and an even number of \"phonons\"; the final state is the excited electronic state and energy eigenstate state of the trap |2ni, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The\nmatrix elements, as a function of \u03b7, are\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\nh2n| cos[kx\u0302(t)]|0i = h2n| cos \u03b7 \u00e2e\u2212i\u03c9T t + \u00e2\u2020 ei\u03c9T t |0i\n\u03b7 2n \u2212\u03b72 /2 i2n\u03c9T t\ne\ne\n.\n= (\u22121)n \u221a\n2n!\n\n(41)\n\nNote that matrix elements for the absorption of an odd number of \"phonons\" vanish due to the even\nparity of cos(kx\u0302). The squares of matrix elements (41) are plotted for the first few n in Fig. 10(a). From\nthe figure we see that transitions |0i \u2192 |0i dominate in the diffusion limit. On the other hand, for \u03b7 \u223c 1,\nthe ground-state wavepacket extends beyond \u00b1\u03bb/4 where the cosine function changes sign. With the sign\nchange the value of the matrix element is reduced. Thus, at \u03b7 = 1.5, the |0i \u2192 |2i transition is strongest,\nwhile for \u03b7 \u223c 2, |0i \u2192 |4i and |0i \u2192 |6i are the strongest transitions. We note then that these strongest,\n\n\f|h2n|cos[k x\u0302]|0i|2\n\n1.0\n\n100\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b3\u03c4 50\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n3.0\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n3.0\n\n\u03b7\nFig. 10. (a) Matrix elements for transitions out of the ground state of the trap, |0i, to the excited state\n|2ni, plotted as a function of Lamb-Dicke parameter \u03b7 for n = 0, 1, 2, and 3 (thicker curve to thinner\ncurve); (b) Mean waiting time until the first quantum jump as a function \u03b7.\n\nmulti-phonon transitions are not excited on resonance; the |0i \u2192 |2ni transition is detuned by an\namount 2n\u03c9T = 2n\u03b3 [Eq. (5)]. The combined effect of these two observations leads to a strong quantum\nsuppression of the fluorescence; hence the reduced heating rate of Fig. 1(b). As an illustration of the\nsuppression, in Fig. 10(b) we plot, as a function of \u03b7, the mean waiting time-beginning in the ground\nstate of the trap-for the very first photon to be scattered. The waiting time grows rapidly for LambDicke parameters larger than \u03b7 = 1.5.\nThere is a great deal more to be said about the quantum-stochastic motion of a trapped ion in the\nregime of large Lamb-Dicke parameters. This regime is similar to that of optical frequency cavity QED,\nwhere the influence of single scattering events is no longer small and the diffusion picture fails, or becomes\nforced at best [32]. As an indication of what is on offer, we conclude with Fig. 11. Here we present\n\nFig. 11. Sample states from quantum trajectories for Lamb-Dicke parameters \u03b7=0.8 (left plots) 1.4 (center plots),\nand 2.2 (right plots). Q functions for the conditional center-of-mass state are plotted.\n\n\fQ functions for sample states reached with Lamb-Dicke parameters \u03b7 = 0.8, 1.4, and 2.2. Of course, a\nhuge variety of such states are visited throughout the course of a quantum trajectory; the question of what\ninteresting quantities might be easily measured has yet to be explored. Note, however, the progression\nfrom the amplitude squeezed state of Fig. 9 to the states with increasing phase uncertainty of Fig. 11.\nNote also the interesting development of the amplitude uncertainty. The state for \u03b7 = 0.8 (on the left in\nthe figure), for example, resides on three metastable amplitudes at once, as a superposition. Then there is\nthe development from left to right-with increasing \u03b7-where, for \u03b7 = 2.2, a somewhat disordered phasespace structure emerges from the quantum interference pattern. Clearly, there remains much interesting\nbehavior to be investigated in future work.\nWork supported by the Marsden fund of the RSNZ.\n6. References\n[1] W. Nagourney, J. Sandberg, and H.
