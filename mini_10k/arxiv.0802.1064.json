Measurements via Aharonov-Bohm interferometry of transmission phases (in addition to conductances) provide valuable information about fundamental\ntransport properties through small systems [1, 2]. An experimental setup conceived and employed in such studies consists of placing a two-dimensional quantum dot\n(QD) in one of the arms of the two-path interferometer\n[1, 2]. In earlier experiments [1] a universal behavior of\nthe phase was found where for each added electron the\nphase drops discontinuously by \u03c0 (phase lapse, PL) before rising back (as expected) continuously by the same\namount. This behavior was found to be independent of\nthe number of electrons, the dot shape and spin degeneracy. The regime of mesoscopic (nonuniversal) behavior\nof the transport through the dot, exhibiting an irregular\nPL pattern and dependencies on the number of electrons\nand dot parameters has been observed only recently [2]\nfor dots with a smaller number of electrons N < 15. The\nlarge majority of theoretical studies attempted to address\nthe PL behavior in the universal regime. Nevertheless,\nthis behavior remains puzzling and challenging [3, 4].\nHere, we focus on the nonuniversal regime (small\nN ) where \"the phase behavior for electron transmission\nshould in principle be easier to interpret\" [2]. To this\naim, we use a transport theory, based on a computational approach entailing exact diagonalization (EXD) [5]\nof the QD many-body Hamiltonian. This approach includes electron correlation effects and allows systematic\ninvestigations of the transport characteristics as a function of the dot shape, number of electrons, and spin configurations. Specifically, we follow the work of Bardeen\n[6] where the correlated many-body states of the QD\nplay a determining role (see below) through the socalled\nquasi-particle wave functions [6, 7] [see Eq. (1)], replacing\nthe single-particle orbitals used in independent-particle\n(and/or mean-field) approaches [8, 9]. This allows evaluation of both the current and transmission phase lapse.\nHere our focus is on the phase-lapse phenomenon [10].\nThe transmission probability (current) is given [6] (to\nlowest order) by the golden rule as a product of the square\nof a dot-to-lead coupling matrix element, M, and a den-\n\nsity of states factor [12]. Exploration of the PL phenomenon in electron transmission from a right (R) to a\nleft (L) lead through a weakly coupled dot involves (as\npart of M) the product of correlated quasi-particle wave\nfunctions of the dot evaluated inside the R and L leadto-dot barriers. M also involves products of the tails of\nthe R and L lead states in the barriers, but these depend only weakly (for high barriers) on the experimentally used plunger potential, and thus they do not enter\nPL considerations [2, 6, 7, 8], when N changes.\nIn the nonuniversal regime, it is desirable to have precise knowledge about the dot parameters (e.g., shape\nanisotropy and strength of interelectron repulsion).\nWhile such characterization has not been done in Ref.\n[2], we inquire here about trends that appear in the calculations as a function of the dot parameters, with subsequent comparisons with the available data. The two key\nparameters that we vary are: (a) the dielectric constant\n\u03ba; driving the QD towards the regime of strong correlations, since the QDs in Ref. [2] are shallower than usual\n(i.e., with larger RW , see below), and (b) the anisotropy\nof the QD, since the sideway plunger influences greatly\nthe average confinement for small dots [13].\nWe performed a systematic examination of the N =\n1 \u2192 N = 2 and N = 2 \u2192 N = 3 transitions. In addition\nto being computationally least prohibitive in the EXD\nmethod, these transitions exhibit the principal generic\nfeatures observed in the nonuniversal regime. In particular, for the first transition no PL was measured, while\na phase lapse was found for the second one. Our calculations reproduce these findings for an appropriate range of\ndot parameters. We predict that: (1) Agreement with the\nexperiment is obtained when the dot parameters (shape\nanisotropy and e\u2212e interaction strength) are chosen to be\nfavorable for electron localization (formation of electron\nmolecules). (2) Spin states are important in the selection\nof transport channels. (3) Excited doorway states play a\nkey role.\nTheory. The current intensity and the electrontransmission phase through the quantum dot relate to\na quasiparticle-type wave function that can be extracted\n\n\ffrom the many-body EXD states as [6, 7]\n\n(a)\n(1)\n\nwhere ai (\u03c3) are the annihilation operators in the\nFock space and \u03c6i (r) are the single-particle eigenstates\nof the two-dimensional anisotropic-oscillator potential\nV (x, y) = m\u2217 (\u03c9x2 x2 + \u03c9y2 y 2 )/2 that confines the electrons\nin the quantum dot, with K = 54 states in the singleparticle basis (which guarantees numerical convergence,\nsee Ref. [11]).\nThe EXD many-body wave functions are expressed as\na linear superposition over Slater determinants D's constructed with the spin orbitals \u03c6i (r)\u03b1 and \u03c6i (r)\u03b2, with\n\u03b1 (\u03b2) denoting up (down) spins, i.e.,\nCIN (S, Sz ; k)DN (I; Sz ).\n\n(3)\n\nI\n\nWhile the Slater determinants conserve only the projection Sz of the total spin, the EXD wave functions in Eq.\n(3) are eigenfunctions of the square S2 of the total spin,\nsince the P\nmany-body Hamiltonian H commutes\nwith\nP\nN\nS2 ; H = i=1 [p2i /(2m\u2217 ) + V (xi , yi )] + i<j e2 /(\u03barij ).\nk = 1, 2, 3, . . . counts the ground and excited states.\nSince in the experiments in the nonuniversal regime\nthe width of the levels of the QD is much smaller than\nthe level separation in the dot (weak dot-lead coupling;\nsee p. 531, left column in Ref. [2]), the QD levels do not\noverlap, thus reinforcing our focus on the dependence of\nthe transmission phase on the quasiparticle states of the\nQD [Eq. (1)]. The current intensity through the quantum\ndot is proportional [6, 12] to the quasiparticle weight\nZ\nW = |\u03c6QP (r)|2 dr\n(4)\nThe transmission phase lapse \u03b8PL through the quantum\ndot is given by\n\u03b8PL = \u2206\u03b8QP \u2212 \u03c0,\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n\nX\n\n0\n\nQP\n\n(b)\n3\n\ni=1\n\n\u03a6EXD\n(S, Sz ; k) =\nN\n\n-80\n\n0\n-80\n80\n\n[p]\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\n80\n(x,y)\n\n2\n\n-80\n\n0\n-80\n80\n\nq\n\n\u03c6i (r)ai (\u03c3),\n\nj\n\nK\nX\n\n0\n80\n\n|\n\n\u03c8(r; \u03c3) =\n\n0.5\n0\n\nQP\n\nwhere the single-particle operator \u03c8(r; \u03c3) annihilates an\nelectron with spin-projection \u03c3 at position r.

The heights of the bars indicate the weight W [Eq. (4)],\nwith a dark shade (red) denoting \u2206\u03b8QP = \u03c0 and a gray shade\n(yellow) denoting \u2206\u03b8QP = 0. In all instances the initial state\nis the singlet [(S = 0, Sz = 0)] ground state of the N = 2\ndot. The bars are arranged in groups of three around each\n(\u03ba,\u03b7) point; the rightmost bar corresponds to the final N = 3\nground state (index 1), while the middle (index 2) and leftmost (index 3) ones correspond to the final N = 3 two lowest\nexcited states with a non-zero weight. All three final states\nhappen to have a (S = 1/2, Sz = 1/2) magnetic structure.\nThe numbers above the bars denote the energy difference (in\nmeV) between the N = 3 ground-state and the two lowest\nexcited (S = 1/2, Sz = 1/2) states. The dot parameters are\nas in Fig. 2.\n\nare led to consider three final states, i.e., the groundstate singlet (S = 0, Sz = 0), and the two excited triplets\n(S = 1, Sz = 0) and (S = 1, Sz = 1), which are degenerate at zero magnetic field. The third triplet state\n(S = 1, Sz = \u22121) has zero weight, since flipping of the\ndirection of the initial spin is not allowed. The calculated\nEXD results are displayed in Fig. 2.\nThe heights of the bars in Fig. 2 represent the weight\nW, while the shading (or color online) of each bar denotes\nthe quasiparticle transmission phase, with a dark shade\n(online red) denoting \u2206\u03b8QP = \u03c0 and a gray shade (online\nyellow) denoting \u2206\u03b8QP = 0. Results are presented for\na weaker e \u2212 e repulsion with \u03ba = 12.50 and a much\nstronger one with \u03ba = 1.25, and for \u03b7 = 1.0 (circular dot),\n\u03b7 = 0.724 (moderate anisotropy), and \u03b7 = 0.5 (strong\nanisotropy).\nInspection of Fig. 2 reveals the following systematic\ntrends: (1) The singlet state and the t0 triplet have in\nall instances \u2206\u03b8QP = 0 (with a PL \u03b8PL = \u2212\u03c0), while\n\nthe t1 triplet has \u2206\u03b8QP = \u03c0 (\u03b8PL = 0, i.e., no PL). (2)\nThe excited t1 triplet state has always the largest weight\nW, and its relative advantage in W compared to the t0\nand the s states increases both for stronger correlations\n(smaller \u03ba) and stronger anisotropies (smaller \u03b7). (3)\nThe singlet-triplet energy gap decreases both for smaller\n\u03ba and \u03b7, i.e., favoring formation of Wigner molecules.\nConsequently, the t1 triplet state can act as a doorway\nstate for the electron transmission in the case of strong\ncorrelations and strong anisotropy. In this case there is\nno phase lapse (\u03b8PL = 0), as observed experimentally [2].\nFurthermore the experiment excluded the ground-state\nsinglet as being the final state of the two electrons [2], in\nagreement with our analysis here which concluded that\nthe excited t1 triplet is a realistic candidate for acting as\na doorway state.\nFor the N = 2 \u2192 N = 3 transition, the initial manybody state is assumed to be the ground state of a QD with\ntwo electrons, which is always a singlet [(S = 0, Sz =\n0)]. Again the final state cannot be restricted to the\n\n\f4\nground state [with (S = 1/2, Sz = 1/2)] of the N =\n3 system [14], since excited states may act as doorway\nstates. Because the transitions to a final (S = 3/2, Sz =\n3/2) or (S = 3/2, Sz = 1/2) state are forbidden (the\ncorresponding W = 0 due to spin blockade), we are led\nto consider three final states, i.e., the ground-state with\n(S = 1/2, Sz = 1/2) and the two-lowest excited states\nalso with (S = 1/2, Sz = 1/2) [14]. In Fig. 3, these final\nstates are denoted by the indices 1, 2, and 3, respectively;\nour results apply unaltered for final states with an Sz =\n\u22121/2 spin projection.\nIn Fig. 3, we retain the same conventions as in Fig. 2\nconcerning the height and shadings (colors online) of the\nbars. Unlike Fig. 2, the final two-lowest excited states in\nFig. 3 are not degenerate, and thus in the latter case we\nlist a pair of energy gaps (in meV) with respect to the\nfinal ground state. In the circular case (\u03b7 = 1), there are\ntwo degenerate final ground states (with total angular\nmomentum L = 1 and L = \u22121) [14], and the smallest\nmeaningful excitation energy gap needs to be taken between the states with indices 1 and 3 (or 2 and 3).\nInspection of Fig. 3 reveals that a transition to the\nN = 3 ground state (marked 1) will always have \u2206\u03b8QP =\n\u03c0 [corresponding to a dark shade (online red)], and thus\nit will exhibit no lapse in the transmission phase \u03b8PL [see\nEq. (5)], in contrast to the experimental result. Transmission through a doorway excited state may become\npossible for smaller \u03ba (stronger Coulomb repulsion) and\nsmaller \u03b7 (stronger anisotropy), since as a result (1) the\nenergy gap between the first excited state (index 2) and\nthe ground state diminishes (observe the practically vanishing gap of 0.003 meV for \u03b7 = 0.5 and \u03ba = 1.25),\nand (2) the weight W of this index-2 final state remains larger than that of the ground state [see the cases\nwith (\u03ba = 1.25, \u03b7 = 0.724) and (\u03ba = 1.25, \u03b7 = 0.5)].\nTransmission through such an index-2 doorway state will\nlead to a phase lapse (\u03b8PL = \u2212\u03c0), since in this case\n\u2206\u03b8QP = 0 [gray shade (online yellow)]. A phase lapse\nin the N = 2 \u2192 N = 3 transition has indeed been observed [2]. As for the N = 1 \u2192 N = 2 transition, this\nobservation of a phase lapse and our EXD analysis of the\nN = 2 \u2192 N = 3 transition suggest that the dots in the\nexperiments were strongly deformed and exhibited rather\nstrong ineterelectron correlations.\nConclusions. In summary, focusing on the mesoscopic\nregime of electron interferometry, and using the Bardeen\nweak-coupling theory in conjunction with exact diagonalization of the many-body quantum dot Hamiltonian,\nwe have shown for the first two transitions, (a) N = 1 \u2192\nN = 2 and (b) N = 2 \u2192 N = 3, nonuniversal behavior of\nthe transmission phases with no phase lapse for (a) and\na phase lapse of \u03c0 for (b), in agreement with the experiment [2]. These results were obtained for a range of dot\nparameters characterized by shape anisotropy and strong\ne \u2212 e repulsion, with both favoring electron localization\nand formation of Wigner molecules [5, 15, 16, 17]. Ad-\n\nditionally, our analysis of the quasiparticle wavefunction\n[Eq. (1)] highlights the dependence of the phase-lapse behavior on the spin configurations of the initial and final\nstates, and the importance of excited doorway states as\nfavored transmission channels. Electron interferometric\nmeasurements on dots with characterized shapes [18], as\nwell as extension of our analysis to a larger number of\nelectrons and the transition to the universal regime, including stronger lead-dot coupling and possibly explicit\nincorporation of lead states, remain future challenges.\nWork supported by the US D.O.E.
