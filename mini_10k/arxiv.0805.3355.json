The latter contain novel, so far unexplored information on the nucleon structure. In order to be\nsensitive to \"intrinsic\" transverse parton momenta it is necessary to measure adequate transverse momenta in the\nfinal state, for example, in SIDIS the transverse momenta of produced hadrons with respect to the virtual photon.\n\u22a5a\na\n\u22a5a\n\u22a5a\nThe eight leading-twist TMDs f1a , f1T\n, g1a , g1T\n, ha1 , h\u22a5a\n[9], and further subleading-twist structures\n1L , h1T , h1\n[22, 23] describe the structure of the nucleon in these reactions. The fragmentation of unpolarized hadrons is described\nin terms two fragmentation functions, D1a and H1\u22a5a , at leading-twist. In SIDIS (with polarized beams and/or targets,\nwhere necessary) it is possible to access information on the leading twist TMDs by measuring the angular distributions\nof produced hadrons. Some data on such processes are available [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,\n38, 39, 40, 41, 42].\nThe fragmentation functions and TMDs in SIDIS and other processes were subject to numerous studies in literature\n[43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. This is true especially\n\u22a5a\nfor the prominent transversity distribution ha1 or the 'naively time-reversal-odd' functions like the Sivers function f1T\n,\n\u22a5a\n\u22a5a\nthe Boer-Mulders function h1 and the Collins fragmentation function H1 . The so far probably least considered\nfunction is the 'pretzelosity' distribution h\u22a5a\n1T .\nThe purpose of this note is therefore three-fold. First, we will review what is known about h\u22a5a\n1T . Second, we\nwill calculate this function in the bag model. Third, we will present estimates for the transverse target single spin\nasymmetry proportional to sin(3\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) in SIDIS in which h\u22a5a\n1T enters, and discuss the prospects to measure this\nasymmetry in experiments at Jefferson Lab.\nII.\n\nTMDS AND SIDIS\n\nHard processes sensitive to parton transverse momenta like SIDIS are described in terms of light-front correlators\nZ\ndz \u2212 d2 ~zT ipz\n\u03c6(x, p~T )ij =\ne hN (P, S)|\u03c8\u0304j (0) {gauge link} \u03c8i (z)|N (P, S)i\n.\n(1)\n(2\u03c0)3\nz + =0, p+ =xP +\n\n\u221a\nWe use light-cone coordinates a\u00b1 = (a0 \u00b1 a3 )/ 2.

Integrating out transverse momenta\nin the correlator (1) leads to the three 'usual' parton distributions known\nR\nfrom collinear kinematics j1a (x) = d2 ~\npT j1a (x, p~T2 ) with j = f, g, h [85, 86]. Dirac-structures other than that in\nEqs. (2, 3, 4) lead to subleading-twist terms [22, 23]. The fragmentation of unpolarized hadrons is described by a\ncorrelator analog to (1) parameterized in terms of two leading-twist fragmentation functions, D1a and H1\u22a5a .\nThe process of SIDIS is sketched in Fig. 1. The cross section differential in the azimuthal angle \u03c6h of the produced\nhadron, see Fig. 1, (and possibly differential also in other kinematic variables) has the following general decomposition\n[7, 69], where the dots indicate power suppressed terms,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\u03c3\ncos(\u03c6h \u2212\u03c6S )\nsin(2\u03c6h )\ncos(2\u03c6h )\n+ \u03bb SL FLL + ST cos(\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6S ) FLT\n+ SL sin(2\u03c6h ) FUL\n= FUU + cos(2\u03c6h ) FUU\nd\u03c6h\n\u0014\n\u0015\nsin(\u03c6h \u2212\u03c6S )\nsin(\u03c6h +\u03c6S )\nsin(3\u03c6h \u2212\u03c6S )\n+ sin(\u03c6h + \u03c6S ) FUT\n+ sin(3\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6S ) FUT\n+ . . .

For the sin(3\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6S ) asymmetry that would mean to weight the events with Ph\u22a5\n.\nThe resulting model-independent tree-level expression for that structure function is then given in terms of certain\n\u22a5\ntransverse moments of h\u22a5\n1T and H1 [9].\nThe analysis of such single spin asymmetries (SSA), however, is involved because acceptance effects are difficult\nto control. So far only preliminary data on (some different) Ph\u22a5 -weighted SSAs are available [32]. Moreover, the\nPh\u22a5 -weighting obscures the actual size of the effect. We shall therefore consider here the 'unweighted' SSA\nsin(3\u03c6\u2212\u03c6S )\n\nsin(3\u03c6\u2212\u03c6S )\nAUT\n\nF\n= UT\nF UU\n\n,\n\n(10)\nsin(3\u03c6\u2212\u03c6S )\n\nsin(3\u03c6\u2212\u03c6 )\n\nS\n= (1\u2212y)F UT\ndependence with the known y-dependence removed, i.e. FUT\nand FUU = (1\u2212y+y 2/2)F UU ,\nsuch that the SSA depends only on x and z. (The SSA depends, of course, also on Q2 . In the parton model this\ndependence is weak, logarithmic, and 'hidden' in the scale dependence of the distribution and fragmentation functions,\nwhich we do not indicate for brevity.)\nIn this case, however, the integrals convoluting the transverse momenta can only be solved, if one assumes some\nmodel for the transverse momentum dependence. Here we shall assume the Gaussian Ansatz\n\nh\u22a5a\n~T2 ) = h\u22a5a\n1T (x, p\n1T (x)\n\n~ 2 2\nexp(\u2212~\npT2 /p2av )\n~ T2 ) = H1\u22a5a (z) exp(\u2212KT /Kav ) .\n, H1\u22a5a (z, K\n2\n2\n\u03c0 pav\n\u03c0 Kav\n\n(11)\n\nThis is, of course, a crude approximation.

A high precision description of pT -effects requires\nmethods along the QCD-based formalism of [2], see [70] and references therein for examples.\nWith the Ansatz (11) we obtain for the SSA the following result\nsin(3\u03c6\u2212\u03c6S )\n\nAUT\n\n(x, z) =\n\nCGauss\n\nP 2 \u22a5(1)a\n\u22a5(1/2)a\n(x) H1\n(z)\na ea x h1T\nP\n,\na xf (x) D a (z)\ne\n1\n1\na\n\n(12)\n\nwhich we have written such that the dependence on the Gauss model is 'dumped' into the factor\nCGauss = f (zpav /Kav ) with f (a) =\n\n3\n.\n(a2/3 + a\u22122/3 )3/2\n\n(13)\n\nIn (12) we have introduced the transverse moments\n\u22a5(1)a\n\nh1T\n\n(x) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 p~T\n\n~T2\np\n\u22a5(1/2)a\n\u22a5a\n~T2 ) , H1\n(z) =\n2 h1T (x, p\n2MN\n\nZ\n\n~T\nd2 K\n\n~T|\n|K\n~ 2) .\nH \u22a5a (z, K\nT\n2zmh 1\n\n(14)\n\nLittle is known about the Gauss model parameters, pav and Kav . Apart from constraints from positivity, we know\nnothing about pav and have only vague constraints on the Gaussian width of the Collins function [58, \u221a\n59]. It is\ntherefore gratifying to observe that f (a) in (13) is a slowly varying function of a satisfying 0 \u2264 f (a) \u2264 3/(2 2). This\nmeans that\n3\n0 \u2264 CGauss \u2264 Cmax = \u221a .\n2 2\n\n(15)\n\nFor physically reasonable values of the ratio pav /Kav (let us guess, for example, that it coincides within a factor of\ntwo with the corresponding ratio of the unpolarized widths punp /Kunp \u2248 1.4 [55]) one may therefore expect that the\nfactor CGauss is within 20 % close to its maximum value. In the following, when we will be interested in estimating\nthe maximal effects for the SSA (12), we will approximate CGauss by Cmax in Eq. (15).\n\n\f4\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT h\u22a5a\n1T ?\n\nIII.\n\nLet us summarize briefly, what we already know, or will learn in the next sections, about the pretzelosity distribution.\n(1) It is chirally odd.\n(2) It has a probabilistic interpretation [8].\n(3) At large-x it is predicted to be suppressed by (1 \u2212 x)2 compared to f1a (x) [65, 66, 67].\n\n(4) It is expected to be suppressed also at small x compared to f1a .\n(5) It must satisfy the positivity condition [68]\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 a\np~T2 \u22a5a\n2\na\n2\n2\nf\n(x,\np\n~\n)\n\u2212\ng\n(x,\np\n~\n)\n\u2264 f1a (x, p~T2 )\nh\n(x,\np\n~\n)\n\u2264\nT\n1\nT\nT\n2 1T\n2MN\n2 1\n\n(16)\n\nor, after integrating over transverse momenta:\n\u22a5(1)a\n\n|h1T\n\n(x)| \u2264\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 a\nf1 (x) \u2212 g1a (x) \u2264 f1a (x) .\n2\n\n(17)\n\n(6) Adding up (17) and the Soffer inequality |ha1 (x)| \u2264 12 (f1a + g1a )(x) [71], we obtain the remarkable bound:\n\u22a5(1)a\n\n|h1T\n\n(x)| + |ha1 (x)| \u2264 f1a (x) .\n\n(18)\n\n(7) In the limit of a large number of colors Nc in QCD pretzelosity is predicted, for pT \u223c O(Nc0 ) and xNc \u223c O(Nc0 ),\nto exhibit the following flavor dependence (the same relation holds for antiquarks) [72]\n\u22a5(1)u\n\n|h1\n|\n\n\u22a5(1)d\n\n(x) \u2212 h1\n{z\nO(Nc2 )\n\n\u22a5(1)u\n\n(x)| \u226b |h1\n}\n|\n\n\u22a5(1)d\n\n(x) + h1\n{z\nO(Nc )\n\n(8) There are estimates from spectator model [73], and bag model, see Sec. IV.\n\n(x)|\n}\n\n(19)\n\n(9) In a large class of models, including the bag and spectator models, pretzelosity is the difference of helicity and\ntransversity distributions, and in this sense a measure for relativistic effects, see Secs. IV and V.\n(10) In some sense it 'measures' the deviation of the 'nucleon shape' from a sphere [74].\n(11) In simple (spectator-type) models, it has been related to chirally odd generalized parton distributions [75].\n(12) It requires the presence of nucleon wave-function components with two units orbital momentum difference, e.g.\ns-d interference of quadratic in p-wave component [67].\n(13) There is no gluon analog of pretzelosity.\nSome comments are in order.\nConcerning the point (4): This expectation is based on experience with evolution properties of integrated parton\ndistributions. The evolution of the chiral-odd ha1 differs significantly from that of the chiral-even f1a or g1a . If at some\ninitial scale ha1 were as large as f1a or g1a (or the Soffer bound [71]) in the small-x region, then at higher scales it would\nbe suppressed [76, 77]. This pattern is expected also for other chirally odd TMDs.\nConcerning the point (6): For u-quarks, that usually dominate in the proton in the valence-x region, the bound\n(17) is more restrictive than the Soffer bound for transversity, because g1u (x) is positive. Thus, positivity gives more\n\u22a5(1)u\n\"room\" for |hu1 (x)| compared to |h1T (x)| (and vice versa for the d-flavor). But from this observation alone we\n\u22a5(1)a\ncannot draw any conclusion on the relative size of |ha1 (x)| and |h1T (x)|, because neither function is a priori \"forced\"\nto saturate its allowed positivity bound. However, there are first indications that hu1 (x) is large, definitely larger than\n\u22a5(1)u\n1\nu\nu\n(x)| . hu1 (x) on the basis of the first indications [57, 58, 59].\n2 (f1 \u2212 g1 )(x) [57, 58, 59]. So one may expect |h1T\nConcerning the point (7): The same flavor dependence as in Eq. (19) holds for all TMDs in a polarized nucleon.\nNotice, that there is also an unintegrated version of (19), see [72].\nConcerning the point (13): Actually, in the decomposition of the gluon analog of the correlator (1) a structure\n\u22a5g\nappears that in Ref. [75] has been called h1T\n, which was of notational convenience for that work. (In Ref. [78] it was\ngiven a different name.) This gluon TMD, however, has different properties compared to our quark pretzelosity. For\n\u22a5a\nexample, the h\u22a5g\n1T of [75] is 'odd' under time-reversal while h1T with a = q, q\u0304 is 'even'.\n\n\f5\nIV.\n\nPRETZELOSITY IN THE BAG MODEL\n\nIn the MIT bag model, the quark field has the following general form [79, 80, 81],\nX\nN (n\u03ba){b\u03b1 (n\u03bam)\u03c8n\u03bajm (~x, t) + d\u2020\u03b1 (n\u03bam)\u03c8\u2212n\u2212\u03bajm (~x, t)} ,\n\u03a8\u03b1 (~x, t) =\n\n(20)\n\nn>0,\u03ba=\u00b11,m=\u00b11/2\n\nwhere b\u2020\u03b1 and d\u2020\u03b1 create quark and anti-quark excitations in the bag with the wave functions\n!\n\u03c9\n|~\nx|\nij0 ( n,\u22121\n)\u03c7\n1\nm\nR0\ne\u2212i\u03c9n,\u22121 t/R0 .\n\u03c8n,\u22121, 12 m (~x, t) = \u221a\n\u03c9\n|~\nx|\n)\u03c7\n4\u03c0 \u2212~\u03c3 * x\u0302 j1 ( n,\u22121\nm\nR0\n\n(21)\n\nFor the lowest mode, we have n = 1, \u03ba = \u22121, and \u03c91,\u22121 \u2248 2.04 denoted as \u03c9 \u2261 \u03c91,\u22121 in the following. In the above\nequation, ~\u03c3 is the 2 \u00d7 2 Pauli matrix, \u03c7m the Pauli spinor, R0 the bag radius, x\u0302 = ~x/|~x|, and ji , are spherical Bessel\nfunctions.

(22) contains both S and P wave components.\nEspecially, t0 represents the S-wave component, whereas t1 represents the P -wave component of the proton wave\nfunctions.\nWith the above wave functions, we can calculate all the leading order TMD quark distributions. Assuming SU (6)\nspin-flavor symmetry of the proton wave function, we have the up-quark and down-quark distributions,\n\u22a5\nh\u22a5q\n1T (x, k\u22a5 ) = Pq h1T (x, k\u22a5 ),\n\n4\n1\n, Pd = \u2212 ,\n3\n3\n\n(25)\n\n16\u03c9 4\n2\n\u03c0 2 (\u03c9 \u2212 1)j02 (\u03c9) MN\n\n(26)\n\nPu =\n\nwhere h\u22a5\n1T can be written as,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 2\n2MN\nt1\nh\u22a5\n(x,\nk\n)\n=\nA\n\u2212\n,\n\u22a5\n1T\nk2\n\nA=\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the lowest root ofpthe bag eigen-equation as we mentioned above. The momenta kz and k are defined as\n2 . R and M are bag radius and proton mass, respectively. In our calculations,\nkz = xMN \u2212 \u03c9/R0 , and k = kz2 + k\u22a5\n0\nN\n2\nwe fix the dimensionless parameter R0 MN = 4\u03c9. Because h\u22a5\n1T depends on t1 , clearly it is proportional to the squared\nof the P -wave [67], and is sensitive to the quark orbital angular momentum in the proton.\nIn order to study the positivity bounds we have discussed in the last section, we list the unpolarized and polarized\nquark distributions in the MIT bag model. We have\n\u0015\n\u0014\nkz\n(27)\nf1 (x, k\u22a5 ) = A t20 + 2t0 t1 + t21\nk\n\u0014\n\u0015\nkz\n2k 2\ng1 (x, k\u22a5 ) = A t20 + 2t0 t1 + t21 ( 2z \u2212 1)\n(28)\nk\nk\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\nkz\n2 kz\n2\n(29)\nh1 (x, k\u22a5 ) = A t0 + 2t0 t1 + t1 2\nk\nk\n\n\f6\nwhere according to the SU(6) spin flavor symmetry\nf1q (x, k\u22a5 ) = Nq f1 (x, k\u22a5 ) , Nu = 2 , Nd = 1 ,\ng1q\n\n(30)\n\nhq1 ,\n\nand the polarized TMDs of definite flavor,\nand\nare given by the expressions analog to (25).\nFrom the above results, we read off the relations, for example\nf1 (x, k\u22a5 ) + g1 (x, k\u22a5 ) = 2h1 (x, k\u22a5 )\n\u22a5(1)\nh1T (x, k\u22a5 )\n\nh1 (x, k\u22a5 ) \u2212\n\n\u22a5(1)\nh1T (x, k\u22a5 )\n\n(31)\n\n= f1 (x, k\u22a5 )\n\n2\n2\nk\u22a5\n/(2MN\n) h\u22a5\n1T (x, k\u22a5 ).\n\n(32)\nh\u22a5\n1T\n\n=\nThus, in the bag model out of the four functions f1 , g1 , h1 ,\nonly\nwhere\ntwo are linearly independent.\nIn QCD the various TMDs are all independent of each other, and describe different aspects of the nucleon structure.\nIn simple models, however, it is natural to encounter relations among TMDs. Since they are all expressed in terms\nof t0 and t1 representing the S and P-wave components of the proton wave function, Eqs. (22, 24), the TMDs cannot\nbe all linearly independent of each other. The specific form of the relations (31, 32) can be traced back to Melosh\nrotations, which relate longitudinal and transverse nucleon polarization states in a Lorentz-invariant way [82]. The\nrelations (31, 32) arise therefore in some sense from Lorentz invariance properly took into account in a simplified\ndescription of the nucleon.\nConsidering the flavor factors (25, 30) dictated by SU(6) symmetry, we obtain from (31, 32) the relations\nPq q\nf (x, k\u22a5 ) + g1q (x, k\u22a5 ) = 2hq1 (x, k\u22a5 )\nNq 1\nPq q\n\u22a5(1)q\nhq1 (x, k\u22a5 ) \u2212 h1T (x, k\u22a5 ) =\nf (x, k\u22a5 ) .\nNq 1\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nThe latter can be rewritten as follows (notice that the signs are such that the first part really remains an equality)\n\u22a5(1)q\n\n|hq1 (x, k\u22a5 )| + |h1T\n\n(x, k\u22a5 )| =\n\n|Pq | q\nf (x, k\u22a5 ) < f1q (x, k\u22a5 ) .\nNq 1\n\n(35)\n\nComparing (35) with (18) we see that the inequality (18) is always satisfied in the bag model, and actually never\nbecomes an equality. In fact, transversity and pretzelosity explore only 23 (only 13 ) of their allowed positivity bound\nfor the u-flavor (d-flavor). Also the inequality (16) is satisfied, because the Soffer inequality holds in the bag model,\nwhich follows analogously from (33), cf. also the detailed discussion in [83].\nConcerning large-Nc, we recall that in the quark model formulated for a general (odd) number of colors Nc , the\nflavor factors (25, 30) are given by Pu = (Nc + 5)/6 and Pd = (\u2212Nc + 1)/6 while Nu = (Nc + 1)/2 and Nd = (Nc \u2212 1)/2\n[84]. Thus, the bag model results respect large-Nc predictions (19) because the employed SU(6) symmetry does so.\nWe also see, however, that 1/Nc -corrections are sizeable for Nc = 3.\nSince only two out of the 4 functions f1 , g1 , h1 , h\u22a5\n1T are linearly independent there are numerous relations among\nthem. The probably most interesting relation results from subtracting the relations (31, 32) from each other. This\nyields (since here a common flavor factor, Pq , enters) the result\n\u22a5(1)q\n\ng1q (x, k\u22a5 ) \u2212 hq1 (x, k\u22a5 ) = h1T\n\n(x, k\u22a5 ) .\n\n(36)\n\nThis is result is remarkable from the point of view of the popular statement 'the difference between transversity and\nhelicity distributions is a measure for relativistic effects in nucleon' [86]. Here, in the framework of the bag model, we\ncan quantify this statement: The difference of helicity and transversity is (a transverse moment of) pretzelosity.\nFrom this discussion we immediately see what happens to h\u22a5q\n1T in the non-relativistic limit: it vanishes. In this\nsense, we arrive at the conclusion that the pretzelosity distribution itself is a measure for relativistic effects in nucleon.\nLet us turn to the discussion of the numerical results1 . Fig. 2 show results for the quantity\nZ\n\u22a5q\nh1T (x) = d2~k\u22a5 h\u22a5q\n(37)\n1T (x, k\u22a5 ) .\n\n1\n\nThe MIT bag gives also rise to antiquark distributions, though to unphysical\nones as the f1q\u0304 (x) come out negative,Pviolating\npositivity.\nR\nR\nq\nNevertheless these contributions are crucial for the normalizations dx f1 (x) = Nq or the momentum sum rule\ndx xf1q (x) = 1,\nq\nthat are satisfied only if one includes the contribution from negative x (where f1q (x) means minus the antiquark-distribution). Moreover,\nthe TMDs receive non-vanishing support also from |x| > 1, and the sum rules are satisfied only when integrating over the whole x-axis.\nIt has been discussed in literature how to deal with these caveats, see for example [87]. In this work, we limit ourselves to quark TMDs\nat 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 (we do not discuss 'valence distributions' f1q val (x) = f1q (x)\u2212f1q\u0304 (x)). When discussing sum rules, however, we shall integrate\nthe TMDs over the whole x-axis.\n\n\f7\nBag model results for scale-dependent quantities refer to a low initial scale Q0 which is understood to be of the order\nof a typical hadronic scale, say Q0 = O(MN ), or even lower, see e.g. [88].\nThe u-quark distribution is negative. Compared to the d-quark distribution, it has opposite sign to and its absolute\nvalue is four times larger - according to (25). The pretzelosity distribution functions have opposite signs compared to\n\u22a5q\nthe transversity distribution functions. Interestingly, the h1T\n(x) are larger than the transversity distribution functions\nq\nq\nh1 (x) in the bag model, and also larger than f1 (x). However, it has to be noted that this quantity, as defined in\nEq. (37), is not constrained by positivity bounds. The h\u22a5q\n1T (x) reach minima or maxima, depending on the flavor,\naround x = (0.2\u20130.3).\n\u22a5(1)q\nWhat is constrained by positivity are the transverse moments h1T (x) of the pretzelosity distribution, see\nEqs. (16, 17, 18). Our results for these quantities, which are defined in Eq. (14), are shown in Fig. 3. The transverse\nmoments of the pretzelosity distributions are smaller than the transversity distributions. For x > 0.1 their absolute\nvalues are always more than a factor 3 smaller than those of hq1 (x). The extrema of the transverse moments are shifted\ntowards larger x compared to h\u22a5q\n1T (x), and appear around x = (0.3\u20130.4).\n\n\u22a5u\n\nh1T (x)\n\n\u22a5d\n\nh1T (x)\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n8\n\n-4\n\n6\n\n(b)\n\nbag model\n\u22a5d\n\nh1T (x)\nd\nf1 (x)\n\nbag model\n\n-6\n\n4\n\n\u22a5u\n\nh1T (x)\n\n-\n\n-8\n\nd\n\n-h1(x)\n\nu\nf1 (x)\nu\nh1(x)\n\n2\n\n-10\n\n0\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 x\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nx\n\n0.8\n\nq\nFIG. 2: The parton distribution function h\u22a5q\n1T (x) vs. x from the bag model (results obtained here) in comparison to f1 (x) and\nq\n\u22a5q\nq\n\u22a5q\nh1 (x) from the same model.

Strictly speaking valence quark distributions were computed there. However, in that model calculation the difference between 'quarks' and 'valence quarks'\ncan be disregarded to a good approximation.

The results refer to a scale as low as the initial scale of the GRV parameterization \u03bc20 = 0.23 GeV2 [89],\nand possibly even lower [73].\nThe contributions from the respective diquarks satisfy the relations, for example,\nar f1r (x, k\u22a5 ) + g1r (x, k\u22a5 ) = 2hr1 (x, k\u22a5 )\nhr1 (x, k\u22a5 )\n\n\u2212\n\n\u22a5(1)r\nh1T (x, k\u22a5 )\n\n=\n\nar f1r (x, k\u22a5 )\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nwhich are the analogs of the bag model relations (31, 32) discussed in Sec. IV. But, since Ma 6= Ms , the relations\n(44, 45) in general do not give rise to relations among TMDs for specific flavors. More precisely, one recovers the\nrelation (34) in the spectator model for d-flavor, since here the scalar quark decouples. For the u-flavor the relation\n(34) follows only in the limit Ma \u2192 Ms , because in that limit the decompositions (38) coincide with the bag model\nSU(6) flavor relations (25, 30). Therefore, although both are based on the SU(6) symmetry, the spectator model is\nmore general than the bag model with respect to the flavor dependence.\nNotice that in spectator models the mass difference between scalar and axial-vector diquarks is responsible for the\n\u2206-nucleon mass splitting whose physical value is reproduced for Ma \u2212 Ms = 200 MeV [90]. In the large-Nc limit we\nhave M\u2206 \u2212 MN = O(Nc\u22121 ), which implies that also Ma \u2212 Ms \u2192 0 in that limit. As for Ma = Ms the flavor relations\n(25, 30), are recovered, see above, the same discussion applies here as in Sec. IV. Thus, the spectator model respects\nthe large-Nc relation (19) - formally and practically, although with non-negligible 1/Nc -corrections, see below.\nFrom this discussion we learn an interesting lesson about the model dependence of relations among different (in\nQCD independent!) TMDs. Relations that involve unpolarized and polarized TMDs are 'flavor dependent', see\n(33, 34), and valid only in 'flavor-blind' models like the bag model, see Sec. IV and [83], or constituent quark models,\nsee [91]. Such relations break down in general in models with non-trivial flavor structure. In fact, the different masses\nof scalar and axial-vector diquarks in the spectator model spoil such relations.\nWhat about relations involving polarized TMDs only? If we subtract the relations (44, 45) from each other f1r (x, k\u22a5 )\ndrops out, and since in that model the flavor structure is precisely the same for all polarized TMDs (independently of\nthe scalar and axial-vector diquark masses), we recover Eq. (36). Thus, the relation (36) among helicity, transversity\nand pretzelosity seems to be valid in a larger class of models. We shall come back to this point in Sec. VI.\n\n\f9\nLet us now discuss numerical results. Fig. 4 shows h\u22a5q\n1T (x) defined in (37). The u-quark distribution is negative and\nq\n(in magnitude) much larger than the positive d-quark distribution. The h\u22a5q\n1T (x) are larger than h1 (x) in that model,\nq\nand also larger than f1 (x) (we recall that this quantity is not constrained by positivity).\n\u22a5(1)q\nFig. 5a shows the transverse moments h1T (x). One can convince oneself that the positivity constraints (17, 18)\nare always satisfied in the model of [73] independently of the specific values for the spectator masses. However, here\nthe flavor structure is more involved, such that it is not possible to see a priori what fraction of the positivity bound\nthe transverse moment of pretzelosity explores - in contrast to bag model, Eq. (35) - and it is worth to look at this\nin more detail. Fig. 5a shows that the transverse moments of pretzelosity never exceed even half of the (17). Also\nthe positivity condition (18) is satisfied, see Fig. 5b. Noteworthy, pretzelosity and transversity use, especially for the\nu-flavor, a large fraction of the room allowed by positivity conditions.\nNext we confront the results from the bag model (obtained here, see Sec. IV) and the spectator model of Ref. [73].\n\u22a5(1)q\n(x) agree, see Fig. 6a and b.\nThere is a good qualitative agreement, the signs and magnitudes of h\u22a5q\n1T (x) and h1T\n\u22a5(1)q\nThe transverse moments h1T (x) are much smaller than the transversity distributions hq1 (x).

As we have discussed, above and\nin Sec. IV, both models are conceptually in agreement with large-Nc. But in both models, of course, the finite value\nNc = 3 is used. It is therefore of interest to investigate to which extent the models reflect the large-Nc pattern in\nEq. (19). In fact, Fig. 6d shows that the modulus of the (u \u2212 d) flavor combination is always larger than that of the\n(u + d) flavor combination, as one would expect on the basis of large-Nc arguments in Eq. (19). But the difference\nbetween the magnitudes of the (u \u00b1 d) flavor combinations is not pronounced. This is true especially in the bag\nmodel where the 'large' (u \u2212 d) flavor combination is only 35 -times larger than the 'small' (u + d) flavor combination.\n(Recall that this factor is Nc3+2 , i.e. in fact large for Nc \u2192 \u221e.) The spectator model reflects more clearly the large-Nc\nbehavior predicted in Eq. (19) - especially if we recall that these predictions are valid for x \u223c O(1/Nc ) [72].\nTo which extent can one expect models formulated for finite Nc = 3 to respect large-Nc predictions of the kind\n(19)? Fig. 6d gives a flavor on that. In nature, large-Nc results are found to hold within a similar accuracy [92].\nInterestingly, the Sivers function predicted to exhibit in the large-Nc limit a flavor dependence analog to (19), see\n[72], seems to obey large-Nc predictions rather closely [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61].\n\n\u22a5q\n\nh1T (x)\n\n\u22a5(1)q\n\n(x)\n\nh1T\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n5\n\nd\n\n0.2\n\nd\n\n0\n0\n-5\n\nu\n\n-10\n\n-0.2\nspectator\nbag model\n\nu\n\n-0.4\n\nspectator\nbag model\n\n-15\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 x\n\n0\n\n\u22a5(1)q\n\nh1T\n\nq\n\n(x) / h1(x)\n\n(c)\n\n\u22a5(1)q\n\nh1T\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\nbag: u & d\n\n-0.4\n\n(d)\n\n-\n\n0\nspectator: u\nspectator: d\n\n(x) vs. large Nc\nu d\nspectator {u+d\nu d\nbag {u+d\n\n0.2\n\n-0.5\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 x\n\n0\n\n-1\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 x\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 x\n\nFIG. 6: Comparison of results from bag model (computed here, cf.

(36)\n\nIn the bag and spectator model the relation (36) is valid not only for quark but also for antiquark distributions.\nHereby one has to take into account that the Dirac-structure in the chirally odd h1 and h\u22a5\n1T is C-odd, while it is\n\u22a5(1)a\na\na\n \u0304\nC-even for g1 . Thus, for antiquarks the relation (36) reads g1 (x, k\u22a5 ) + h1 (x, k\u22a5 ) = \u2212h1T (x, k\u22a5 ) with a = \u016b, d.\nWhile strictly speaking in the bag model anti-quark distributions are unphysical, see footnote 1, one obtains in\nprinciple consistent results in the spectator model. In [73] no antiquark distributions were considered, however, this\ncan be done precisely as sketched in Eqs. (38-43) but with additional parameters for the (four-quark-) spectators,\nwhich must be tuned. The results, however, are analog to (38-43) and satisfy the relation (36) for antiquarks.\nSo, in the quark models we have discussed the relation (36) holds for both, quark and antiquark TMDs. It will also\nbe valid in a large class of relativistic models, e.g. the constituent quark models of the kind used in [91], or in the\nmodel of [93] (which remains to be verified by direct calculations). The question that naturally arises is: How general\nis the relation (36)?\nWhen discussing this question it is important to observe that Eq. (36) relates chirally even and chirally odd TMDs,\ni.e. it relates quark (and anti-quark) TMDs having gluon 'partners' and such having no gluon counterparts, cf. Sec. III.\nIt is clear that the evolution properties of these TMDs are different. Therefore, if the relation (36) were valid at some\ninitial scale, then it certainly would not be valid at a different scale.\nThese considerations imply, that the relation (36) can be valid only in 'no-gluon models'. This expectation is\nsupported by the model calculations of Ref. [75]. There (among others) quark and gluon TMDs in a hypothetical\n'quark target' were computed. It was found that g1 (x, k\u22a5 ) \u2212 h1 (x, k\u22a5 ) 6= 0 (meaning that the model is 'relativistic')\nbut difference was not related to pretzelosity. The latter is zero in that model (to the considered order of '\u03b1s ') [75].\nThis is in line with our expectations: the explicit inclusion of gluon degrees of freedom spoils (36).\nNevertheless, Eq. (36) could turn out to be approximately satisfied, and useful for estimating pretzelosity on the\nbasis of the helicity and transversity distributions, which we know presently better, or are on a good way to that\n[57, 58, 59]. At this point, since this relation is found in models without gluons (where we simply could 'neglect' the\ngauge-links), presumably the k\u22a5 -integrated version of (36) is a more reliable prediction of relativistic quark models.\nVII.\n\nPRELIMINARY COMPASS DATA, AND FUTURE EXPERIMENTS AT JLAB\n\nIn the COMPASS experiment the sin(3\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) and other SSAs were measured on a deuteron target [41].

We compare the positivity-bound result to the\npreliminary data [41].\nAt larger x > 0.1 the statistics analyzed in [41] is not sufficient to be sensitive to the pretzelosity distribution.\nHowever, below x < 0.1 COMPASS data favor that pretzelosity does not saturate its bound.

Either, the chiral-odd pretzelosity is suppressed at small-x with respect to the\nchiral-even f1 , which is expected, see Sec. III. Or, the u and d-flavors have opposite signs, as predicted in the large-Nc\nlimit and the models. Or, both. In view of the early stage of art it is too early to draw definite conclusions.\nAn important observation, however, is that in spite of the small (consistent with zero) effect observed at COMPASS,\npretzelosity does not need to be small in the region x > 0.1, see Fig. 7, where JLab can measure with great precision.\nSo there is no discouragement due to small COMPASS pretzelosity effect for the planned CLAS measurements!\nIt remains to be mentioned that HERMES also studied the sin(3\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) azimuthal modulation in the transverse\ntarget experiments. It was quoted that this SSA is zero within error bars, see e.g. [29, 31, 40]. Presumably, an SSA\nas large as what we obtain from saturating positivity (see below) would have been seen at HERMES. However, since\nno HERMES data were shown on that observable, we cannot draw quantitative conclusions from that.\nIn order to see how further analyses from HERMES, as well as future experiments at COMPASS and Jefferson Lab\ncould improve our understanding of pretzelosity, let us estimate the upper bounds for the modulus of the SSA for\ncharged pion production from various targets. Using the positivity bound (17) we obtain the results in Fig. 8.\nThe SSAs for charged pions could reach up to \u223c 5%. Even asymmetries reaching half or one third of that size\nwould be measured, especially in the region of x \u223c (0.1\u20130.4) in the CLAS experiment. This is shown in Fig. 9, where\nwe plot the \u03c0 + SSA from a proton target in the kinematics of CLAS with 12 GeV beam upgrade. Shown are also\nerror projections for 2000 hours run time from [96]. Notice that the models predict a negative SSA.\nWe add that the \u03c0 0 SSA is small on any target, because the modulus of this SSA is proportional to |H1\u22a5fav + H1\u22a5unf |\nwhich is small (actually zero within error bars), since H1\u22a5unf \u2248 \u2212H1\u22a5fav holds within error bars [57, 58, 59].\n\nS)\n|Asin(3\u03c6-\u03c6\nUT, prot (x)|\n\n(a)\n\nS)\n|Asin(3\u03c6-\u03c6\nUT, deut (x)|\n\n(b)\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nx\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n-\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\n+\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n0.06\n\nS)\n|Asin(3\u03c6-\u03c6\nUT, neut (x)|\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\nsin(3\u03c6\u2212\u03c6 )\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nx\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nx\n\nS\nFIG. 8: The modulus of the transverse target SSA AU T\nin charged pion production from proton, deuteron, and neutron\ntargets as function of x.

It can be summarized for illustrative purposes by the following assertion:\nhelicity \u2212 transversity = pretzelosity.\n\n(50)\n\nThat the difference between the helicity and transversity distributions is 'a measure of relativistic effects' is known\nsince long ago [86] (and was also recognized in a bag model calculation). However, now we are in a position to\nmake this statement more precise. This difference is just pretzelosity. Thus, h\u22a5\n1T 'measures' relativistic effects in the\nnucleon, and vanishes in the non-relativistic limit where helicity and transversity distributions become equal.\nThis relation is not supported in models with explicit gluon degrees of freedom [75], and, of course, cannot be true\nin QCD where all (eight) transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions are linearly independent.\nNevertheless, the relation (50), see Eq. (36) for its precise formulation, could turn out to be a useful approximation.\nIn view of the numerous novel functions involved, any well-motivated approximation is welcome and valuable [64].\nBesides being useful for extending our intuition on relativistic spin-orbit effects in nucleon [67, 74], the relation (50)\nu\nhas also an important consequence on transversity. In the bag and spectator model h\u22a5u\n1T is negative. Since g1 (x) is\nq\nq\nu\nu\npositive, this implies that h1 (x) > g1 (x). For the d-flavor signs are reversed, but in any case |h1 (x)| > |g1 (x)|. This\nis found also in models, e.g. [95].\nIn the bag model, the negative sign of h\u22a5u\n1T arises because it is proportional to minus the square of the p-wave component of the nucleon wave function. Thus, in models with no higher orbital momentum (d-wave, etc.) components,\n\u22a5d\nh\u22a5u\n1T is manifestly negative (h1T has opposite sign dictated by SU(6) symmetry, and predicted in large Nc [72]).\nThis prediction can be tested at JLab. Since the production of positive pions from a proton target is dominated by\nthe u-flavor, one expects a negative sin(3\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) SSA, see Fig. 9.\nForthcoming analyses and experiments at COMPASS, HERMES and JLab [96, 97, 98] will provide valuable information on the pretzelosity distribution function, and deepen our understanding of the nucleon structure.\n\n\f14\nAcknowledgements.
