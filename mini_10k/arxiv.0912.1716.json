The pseudo scalar coupling to photons is identical to that of the axion;\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nL \u2283 4M\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 F \u03bc\u03bd F \u03bb\u03c1 , and a scalar field couples through the Lagrangian term; L \u2283 4M\nF\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd .\nThe presence of contact interactions between ALPs and photons means that ALPs affect the\npropagation of photons through a magnetic field. In such an environment a photon can oscillate\ninto an ALP with probability [1]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206(z)\n2\n2\nP (z) = sin 2\u03b8 sin\n.\n(1)\ncos 2\u03b8\nHere z is the distance traveled, \u2206(z) = m2ef f z/4\u03c9 and tan 2\u03b8 = 2B\u03c9/M m2ef f . m2ef f = |m2\u03c6 \u2212\n\u03c9P2 |, m\u03c6 is the ALP mass, \u03c9P the plasma frequency of the medium, \u03c9 the photon frequency\nfrequency, B the magnetic field strength and M the strength of the photon-ALP coupling.\nIn these proceedings we describe a new test for ALPs which looks for the effects induced\nby strong ALP-photon mixing on the luminosity of astronomical objects observed through the\nmagnetic fields of galaxy clusters. Our results apply to ALPs with masses m\u03c6 . 10\u221212 eV.\nThe constraints on the couplings of such ALPs are: 1011 GeV . M for pseudo-scalars [2], and\n1026 GeV . M for scalars [3]. However a subclass of scalar ALPs known as chameleonic [4]\nALPs avoid these constraints because their mass depends on the local density, their coupling is\nrequired to satisfy 109 GeV . M [5].\nPatras 2009\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAstronomy with ALPs\n\nThe magnetic fields of galaxy clusters fluctuate on many different scales. However, at the\nhigh frequencies we consider in what follows the simple cell magnetic field model can be\nshown to give the same results for ALP-photon mixing as modeling the variations in the magnetic field with a power spectrum. The cell model of the magnetic field assumes the field is\nmade up of a large number of equally sized magnetic domains. The magnitude of the field\nstrength is the same in each domain but the orientation of the field is randomly chosen.\nWhen the probability of mixing between ALPs\nand photons is large the system of photons and\nALPs can be evolved through a large number of\nrandomly oriented magnetic domains analytically;\nthis is known as the strong mixing limit. If L is\nthe size of a magnetic domain, N the number of\ndomains traversed and P \u2261 P (L) is the probability of photon to ALP conversion in one magnetic\ndomain, we say that strong mixing occurs when\nN P \u226b 1 and N \u2206(L) . \u03c0/2. In this limit the\nprobability of mixing is large, and frequency independent. Strong mixing occurs in the magnetic\nfields of galaxy clusters for x-ray or gamma-ray\nphotons if M . 1011 GeV, assuming m\u03c6 . \u03c9P .1\nParticles with such masses and couplings are allowed by current observations for pseudo-scalar\nFigure 1: Simulated fingerprint for best fit\nfields and for chameleonic scalars.\nGaussian model\nAs photon number is not conserved photonALP mixing will change the apparent luminosity\nof objects observed through the cluster. We define the attenuation factor to be the ratio of the\nflux of photons after passing through N domains to the initial flux of photons; C = I\u03b3 (N )/I\u03b3 (0).\nThen in the strong mixing limit, assuming no initial flux of ALPs, the mean value for C is\nC = 2/3 [7], and its probability distribution is [8]\n\"\n\u0013\u22121/2 !\n\u00131/2 !#\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2c+\n2c\u2212\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\ntan\n\u2212 tan\n, (2)\na 1\u2212\na 1\u2212\nfC (c; p0 ) = p\n1 + p0\n1 \u2212 p0\n1 \u2212 p20\nwhere a = (1 + p0 )/(1 \u2212 p0 ), c\u00b1 = min (c, (1 \u00b1 p0 )/2) and p0 is the initial polarization of the\nphotons. This probability distribution has an unusual shape, and is very asymmetric about the\nmean. In the next Section we show that this can be exploited as a new test for ALPs.\n\n3\n\nSearching for ALPs with luminosity relations\n\nTo use the shape of the probability distribution (2) to look for ALPs we would need to know the\nhigh energy photon flux for a class of astronomical sources. We do not currently know of any ob1 The strength of the magnetic field is B \u2248 1 \u2212 10 \u03bcG, the size of a magnetic domain is L \u2248 1 kpc and for a\ntypical source inside the cluster we expect the light observed from that source to have traversed N \u2248 100 \u2212 1000\nmagnetic domains [6]. The plasma frequency in the intracluster medium is \u03c9P \u2248 10\u221212 eV\n\n2\n\nPatras 2009\n\n\fjects that are standard candles in x- or gamma-rays, however, for certain classes of object there\nexist luminosity relations which correlate the high frequency luminosity of an object with a feature of its low energy spectrum. At low frequencies light mixes weakly with ALPs and hence we\nassume that low energy observables are not affected by ALPs at leading order. Therefore luminosity relations can be used to normalize the high energy flux, so that the effects of ALPs are observable.\nThe relations typically take the form\nlog10 Yi = a + b log10 Xi + Si ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Yi is the high energy luminosity, and Xi is\nthe low energy feature of the spectrum for the ith object in the survey. Si represent the scatter\nin individual measurements, it is standard in astronomy to assume they are normally distributed;\nSi = \u03c3\u03b4i where \u03b4 \u223c N (0, 1). If the high frequency light mixes strongly with ALPs this will\nappear as an additional contribution to the scatter Si = \u03c3\u03b4i \u2212 log10 Ci , where the Ci are described\nby the probability distribution function (2).\nFor a given data set we use the likelihood ratio\ntest to see if the data prefer strong ALP-photon\nmixing, or the null hypothesis of Gaussian noise.\nWe find the values of the parameters a, b and \u03c3 Figure 2: Simulated fingerprint for best fit\nwhich maximize the likelihood of each hypothe- ALP strong mixing model\nsis given the data, and then compare these two\nmaximum likelihoods with the ratio r(p0 ) = 2 log(L\u03021 (p0 )/L\u03020 ), where L\u03021 (p0 ) is the maximum\nlikelihood allowing for strong ALP-photon mixing and L\u03020 is the maximum likelihood for models\nwhere the scatter is purely Gaussian. The two hypothesis have the same number of parameters and therefore r(p0 ) is equivalent to the Bayesian Information Criterion. Negative r(p0 )\nis evidence against ALP strong mixing, and positive r(p0 ) is evidence for ALP strong mixing.\n|r(p0 )| > 6 is considered strong evidence, |r(p0 )| > 10 is considered very strong evidence.\n\n4\n\nResults from active galactic nuclei\n\nTo apply the test developed in the previous section we require a class of compact objects\nwithin galaxy clusters that emit x-ray or gamma-ray light and for which luminosity relations\nexist correlating the high energy luminosity with a feature of the low-energy spectrum. Active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) satisfy these requirements. For AGN a luminosity relation has been\nestablished between the 2 keV x-ray luminosity and the 5 eV optical luminosity. We have\nobservations of 77 AGN from the COMBO-17 and ROSAT surveys [9] and 126 objects from\nthe SDSS survey [10].\nApplying the likelihood ratio test described in the previous section to these results we find\nr(p0 . 0.5) \u2248 25, where the expectation from AGN physics is that p0 < 0.1 [11].\nAs a qualitative check of this result we plot fingerprints of the data. To do this we construct\n105 new data sets, of the same size as the original, by bootstrap re-sampling (with replacement) of the original data set. For each data set we calculate the statistical moments of the\nPatras 2009\n\n3\n\n\fP\n1/m\nwhere si = log10 Yi \u2212 (a + b log10 Xi ). These moments\ndistribution km (si ) = [(1/Np ) i sm\ni ]\nparametrize the shape of the probability distribution. Fingerprints of the data are then histogram plots of ki vs. kj for the resampled data sets. Figures 1 and 2 show example fingerprints\nfor simulated data respectively without and with the effects of strong ALP-photon mixing.\nDarker regions indicate a higher density of points.\nFigure 3 shows the same plot for the data obtained\nfrom observations of AGN.\nComparing Figures 2 and 3 there is a clear\nqualitative similarity between the shapes of the\npredicted and observed distributions. This similarity persists when higher moments of the distribution are plotted.\nThe astrophysics underlying the luminosity relation for AGN is not known, and we cannot rule\nout that a combination of standard physical processes in the AGN conspires to mimic the effects\nof ALP-photon mixing. It can be shown, however,\nthat the scatter in the luminosity relation is not\nredshift dependent, therefore the observed scatter is not due to evolution effects or an incorrect\nFigure 3: Fingerprint from AGN data\nchoice of cosmological model.\n\nAcknowledgments\nCB acknowledges support from the German Science Foundation (DFG) under Collaborative\nResearch Centre (SFB) 676.
