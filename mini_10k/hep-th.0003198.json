Introduction and summary\nThe remarkable success in the understanding of non-perturbative properties of\nstring theories triggered by string dualities can not conceal the fact that their impact on\nthe formulation of theories with N < 2 supersymmetry and dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking has been much less effective. In fact the step to N = 1 supersymmetry\nmay be already a vital one for the description of the non-supersymmetric world as\nit is known that dynamical supersymmetry breaking may appear in these theories as\na consequence of strong gauge interactions [1]. It is interesting that supersymmetry\nbreaking in the string theory might be so closely related to its low energy sector. In fact\nin the realization of confinement as result of monopole condensation [2][3], anomaly\nconsiderations imply a non-zero gaugino condensate [4] which breaks supersymmetry\nin the theory coupled to gravity [1]. In this sense the lack of supersymmetry observed\nin our world could be linked in an intriguing way to the existence of confining gauge\ntheories.\nOne of the most useful N = 2 dualities has been the one between type II and\nheterotic strings [5][6]. As the heterotic coupling maps to a geometric modulus in\nthe type II theory, non-perturbative effects of the heterotic theory are related to tree\nlevel of the type II string. In particular space-time instanton effects map to geometric\ninstantons in the type II theory which can be calculated by mirror symmetry. More\nfundamentally the instantons in the type II theory can be viewed as honest space-time\ninstantons in the RR-sector, which has the special property to not depend on the type\nII string coupling and thus is described by string tree level.\nThis opens the fascinating possibility that after a supersymmetry breakdown to\nN = 1, dynamical supersymmetry breaking to N = 0 in the RR-sector of the type II\ntheory is calculable as the non-perturbative effects are still governed by a geometric\ncoupling constant and not the string coupling. In particular condensation of fermions\nwill appear at string tree level. This non-supersymmetric type II theory will be dual\nto a N = 1 supersymmetric heterotic theory where supersymmetry is broken only\n\nin the non-perturbative sector of the string theory. Such a picture was advocated\n\nin [7] using the special constructions of [8] to obtain N = 1 dual pairs from N =\n\n2 ones by freely acting orbifolds1 . Based on qualitative arguments on the general\nproperties of the orbifolding procedure it was argued that indeed gaugino condensation\n1\n\nThe relation between spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in string theory and freely acting\n\norbifolds with various supersymmetries has been studied in refs.[9].\n\n1\n\n\fin the heterotic theory should map to a tree level supersymmetry breaking in the type\nII theory which, remarkably enough, was related to monopole condensation and the\nassociated relalization of confinement. Unfortunately the orbifold duals of [7] are not\naccessible to instanton calculations by mirror symmetry and thus the study of string\nduals with supersymmetry breaking has been restricted to a rather qualitative level,\nfar from the success in the N = 2 supersymmetric case. To provide a calculable\n\nframework of string duals with dynamical supersymmetry breaking is one of the goals\nof this paper.\nIn a seemingly unrelated development in the supergravity part of the world, the\nno-go theorem [10] on partial local supersymmetry breaking N = 2 \u2192 N = 1 was\n\ndeprived its validity [11]. The argument is that for a special class of supergravity\ntheories, the tensor calculus of ref. [12], which was the basis for the derivation of the\nno-go theorem, is inappropriate. In these special cases, the no-go theorem does not\napply and spontaneous partial supersymmetry breaking has indeed be shown to be\npossible [11]. In string theory compactifications, scalar potentials that may trigger\nspontaneous supersymmetry breaking can be induced by RR background fields in the\ntype II string [13] or magnetic backgrounds in the dual heterotic theory [14]. However,\nas we will argue in this paper, partial breaking fails to exist, although in an interesting\nway. The reason is that even though the conditions of partial supersymmetry breaking\nmay be satisfied in the classical string effective theory, there will always be instanton\neffects in compactifications with finite volume, that restore the foundations of the\n\nno-go theorem. We will also argue that the effect of these instantons is to break\nsupersymmetry completely, rather then to restore N = 2.\nAn interesting picture begins to emerge by observing that the classical string\neffective theories associated to N = 2 type II/heterotic duals fall precisely into the\nclass of supergravities that satisfy the necessary conditions for partial supersymmetry\nbreaking. Would it not be for the instanton effects, we would get N = 1 supersym-\n\nmetric dual pairs in this way. Turning to the instanton corrections one observes that\nthey represent non-perturbative space-time effects in the heterotic string and tree level\ngeometric instantons in the type II theory. In other words, the instanton effects that restore the no-go theorem embody precisely the sought for description of non-perturbative\ndynamical supersymmetry breaking. Using mirror symmetry in the tree level type II\ntheory to determine the geometric instantons we are thus in the remarkable situation\nto be able to systematically calculate the instanton effects of a phenomenologically\nrelevant non-perturbative supersymmetry breaking.\n2\n\n\fInterestingly, and in full agreement with the observations made in the free orbifold models of [7], the supersymmetry breaking is intimately related to strong gauge\ninteractions in a SYM theory embedded into the string theory. In fact this theory is\nof \"the world on a brane\" type, with the gauge fields localized on a hypersurface of\nten-dimensional space-time. These theories have been very successfully studied in the\nN = 2 context in terms of curved brane geometries in string theory, either in the geo-\n\nmetric engineering of type II strings on singularities of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds [15][16][17]\nor, for simple enough gauge group G, in terms of the T-dual type IIA 5-brane [15].\nThe latter realization can also be reached starting from field theories living on the\nworld-volume of \"flat branes\" which are bent by quantum corrections in a way determined by the non-perturbative duality to M-theory [18]. Both, the \"flat\" and the\ncurved brane constructions, give a string theory realization of the intensively discussed\nextra large dimension scenarios [19]. In particular the \"flat branes\" have become a\nmost popular tool in qualitative phenomenological studies due to their conceptional\nsimplicity as compared to the geometric approach.\nSo finally, taking the point particle limit of the eventually non-supersymmetric\ndual pair, leads us right to an extension of geometric engineering2 to more realistic\nSYM theories on the brane, with broken supersymmetry and patterns of confinement\nand chiral symmetry breaking3 . Using the results from mirror symmetry in the type\nII theory allows to derive the explicit non-perturbative scalar potential in the SYM\ntheory on the brane.\nIt is worth noting that the description of supersymmetry breaking in the SYM\ntheory on the brane is quite relevant for the large dimension scenarios one of whose\nprimary motivations has been the hierarchy problem. A serious attempt to explain\nthe apparent weakness of gravity should be based on a framework of quantum gravity\nsuch as string theory, and not just field theories on \"flat branes\". Note that the\nresurrection of the no-go theorem implies that the complete breakdown to N = 0\n\n(rather than N = 1) is inevitable when the SYM is coupled to string theory. It\n\nwould be quite interesting to develop the understanding of the field theories based\n\n\"flat branes\" with N = 1 supersymmetry [21] to a level where the supersymmetry\n2\n\nA different approach uses F-theory compactifications [20].\n\n3\n\nIn the following we will use the definiton of a brane in the general sense of specifying a\n\nhypersurface on which the gauge fields localize. This notion is independent of the specific string\ntheory construction in terms of dual D-branes, M-branes or geometrically engineered theories at\na singularity.\n\n3\n\n\fbreakdown can be seen, at least qualitatively. The reason that the flat branes miss\nthis effect is apparently the lack of a satisfying description of the coupling of the world\nvolume theory to gravity and string theory.\nNote that we argued that the restoration of the no-go theorem relies on stringy\ninstantons on a finite volume manifold. This does not exclude partial supersymmetry\nbreaking in diverse non-compact limits. In particular, taking all, transverse as well\nas tangential dimensions of infinite volume gives a pure field theory decoupled from\nstrings and gravity. It should be clear that neither there is a no-go theorem in pure\nfield theory nor do we claim so4 . In fact, while we completed this work, an interesting\npaper appeared [23], which also describes supersymmetry breaking by RR fluxes in the\ncontext of geometric engineering. In ref.[23] the limit of infinite string mass Mstr is\ntaken which results in a pure field theory decoupled from string theory where partial\nbreaking is possible. Moreover this reference contains an elegant derivation of how\nthe relevant N = 1 superpotentials follow from soliton masses in the presence of RRpotentials.\n\nThis paper is organized in two parts. In the first part we consider the issue of\npartial supersymmetry breaking in the string effective supergravity. In section 2 we\nargue that for string compactifications on manifolds with finite volume, any classical\npartial breaking to N = 1 is followed by a further breakdown to N = 0 by instanton\n\neffects. We resurrect the general no-go theorem on partial breaking for string effective\n\ntheories. In section 3 we relate these results to the class of string effective theories\nwhich reduce to ordinary Super-Yang-Mills theories in the point particle limit. The\ninstantons that are relevant for the supersymmetry breakdown turn out to be nonperturbative in the field theory coupling. In section 4 we describe in more detail the\nmechanism of supersymmetry breaking and the calculation of the non-perturbative\ngravitino masses by mirror symmetry. Moreover we observe a general link between the\nbreakdown of supersymmetry and that of conformal invariance.\nIn the second part, which starts with section 5 and can be read almost independently, we focus further on the pattern of supersymmetry breaking in the point\nparticle limit, namely in the SYM on the brane embedded in the string theory. The\ngeneral non-perturbative scalar potential contains apart from the N = 1 adjoint mass\nterm extra soft breaking terms that arise from the coupling to the string sector. We\n\nuse special geometry to proof that these terms are mandatory and there is no partial\n4\n\nE.g., gaugino condensation does not break supersymmetry in field theory [22].\n\n4\n\n\fbreaking to N = 1 in the field theory coupled to string theory. The scale of supersymmetry breaking terms is determined by the string scale Mstr , which is argued to be\nfavorably in the TeV range, multiplied by a factor \u223c b1 * VT\u22121\nV , where b1 is the one-loop\nbeta function coefficient of the SYM theory and VT V the volume of the dimensions\ntransverse to the gauge theory. Details on the supergravity calculations are relegated\nto the appendices.\n\n2. Partial supersymmetry breaking in N = 2 supergravity\n(or \"Two into one still won't go\")\nBefore focusing on the string theory embeddings of SYM theories let us ask in\ngeneral what patterns of supersymmetry breaking may appear in the N = 2 string\neffective theory. As far as partial local supersymmetry breaking by a Super-Higgs\neffect is concerned, there used to be a very strong result, the \"Two into one won't go\"\ntheorem of [10]. It states that a zero eigenvalue of the gravitino mass matrix implies\nthat the second one is zero, too.\nHowever, the no-go theorem is based on the existence of a holomorphic prepotential F (zi ) that defines the effective N = 2 supergravity action of the nV vector\nmultiplets. At that time this was indeed the only known description of the N = 2 supergravity theory [12]. Since then, an alternative definition has been formulated which\nis not based on a prepotential [24]. It thus appeared that the absence of a prepotential might possibly allow to evade the no-go theorem and indeed it was shown in [11]\nthat partial supersymmetry breaking is possible in this special situation. The globally\nsupersymmetric version of this partial breaking has been described independently in\n[25].\nThe necessary condition for the absence of a prepotential and thus partial supersymmetry breaking is the following one. The framework of [24] starts from a section\n\u03a0 = (X \u03a3 , F\u03a3 )T of a Sp(2nV + 2, Z) bundle over MV . It is invariant under symplectic\ntransformations acting on \u03a0:\n\u03a0 \u2192 M \u03a0,\n\nM \u2208 Sp(2n + 2, Z).\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe components X \u03a3 , F\u03a3 of the section \u03a0, also called periods, depend on the nV scalar\ncomponents zi of the vector multiplets which parametrize an nV dimensional special\nK\u00e4hler manifold MV . In a generic situation the upper components X \u03a3 can be thought\nof as homogeneous coordinates on MV , while the lower half F\u03a3 of \u03a0 is related to a\n5\n\n\fprepotential F (X \u039b ) of homogeneous degree two by F\u03a3 = \u2202F /\u2202X \u03a3. The transition to\nthe generic inhomogeneous variables zi on MV is described by the matrix\nA\u03a3i =\n\n\u2202X \u03a3\n.\n\u2202zi\n\n(2.2)\n\nFor a special form of the prepotential F and a special choice of the section \u03a0, the matrix\nA\u03a3i may be degenerate. Then the X \u03a3 can not serve as homogeneous coordinates on\nMV and no prepotential F (X \u039b ) exists. Note that this statement is not invariant\nunder Sp(2n + 2, Z) transformations and by choosing a different section \u03a0\u0303 = M \u03a0 one\nmay always transform to homogeneous coordinates X\u0303 \u03a3 in which a prepotential F\u0303 (X\u0303 \u03a3 )\nexists.\nA string effective supergravity related to the geometric type II compactification\non a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold M is classically described by a cubic prepotential\nF=\n\n1\n1\nCijk X i X j X k /X 0 = (X 0 )2 Cijk ti tj tk ,\n3!\n3!\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere ti = X i /X 0 are so-called special coordinates that parametrize volumes of homology 2-cycles in M . Depending on the intersection matrix Cijk of M it may be possible\nto choose a section \u03a0 where the X \u03a3 are dependent, the matrix A\u03a3i is degenerate and\npartial breaking to N = 1 supersymmetry is possible5 .\nHowever in a finite volume there are stringy instanton corrections to the classical\nprepotential (2.3) that change this picture. The exact instanton corrected prepotential\ncan be determined [26] using mirror symmetry6 . Specifically, the components of \u03a0 are\nidentified under mirror symmetry with the period integrals of the holomorphic 3-form\n\u03a93,0 on the mirror manifold W of M :\nZ\nZ\n(3,0)\n\u03a3\n\u03a9\n(W ),\nF\u03a3 =\n\u03a9(3,0) (W ).\n(2.4)\nX =\nA\u03a3\n\nB\u03a3\n\nHere {A\u03a3 } denotes an integral basis of homology 3-cycles and {B\u03a3 } their duals.

To do so we have to assure\n\nthat after the inclusion of the instanton corrections, the upper part X\u0302 \u03a3 of any section\n\u03a0\u0302 gives good homogeneous coordinates on MV . By the relation (2.4) this is the same\n\nas asking whether for any choice of a basis of A-cycles in (2.4), the period integrals\nrepresent locally good homogeneous coordinates on MV . Luckily this type of question\nis a prominent one in algebraic geometry and is part of the so-called infinitesimal\n\nTorelli problem. In the present context it has been shown in ref.[29] that the period\nintegrals indeed have the required property.\n\nIn conclusion, although partial supersymmetry breaking may appear to be possible\nin the classical string theory, there will be always stringy instanton corrections that\nlead to a complete breakdown of supersymmetry and the mechanism of refs.[11] can\nnot be realized in the string effective theory.\n\n3. Localized SYM theories and their string theory embedding\n\nForm the point of physics, the situation that the classical section \u03a0 allows for\npartial supersymmetry breaking while the instanton corrected one does not is quite\na remarkable one. Specifically the supersymmetry breaking scale will depend nonperturbatively on the K\u00e4hler moduli. We will argue now that this is the case in the\nclass of string effective theories realizing SYM theories localized on a six-dimensional\nhypersurface of space-time. As we will discuss in the following, the relevant modulus\nis identical to the field theory coupling constant and the supersymmetry breakdown is\nthus interpreted as a non-perturbative breaking by space-time instantons.\n7\n\n\f3.1. Geometry and couplings\nThe geometric engineering approach [15][16][17] starts from a type II string compactified on an almost singular Calabi\u2013Yau manifold X 7 . It is useful to think about\nthis compactification as a two step process of a compactification to six dimensions on\na singular two complex-dimensional manifold Y followed by a further compactification on the base sphere B to four dimensions. At the singular point p of Y there are\nr = rk G small 2-spheres Ci with an intersection matrix equal to the negative of the\nG\nCartan matrix Cij\n. D2-branes wrapped on the 2-spheres Ci represent N = 2 vector\nmultiplets in six dimensions with a gauge kinetic term (in a tree level approximation)\nLkin =\n\n1\n(j)\nCij F (i)\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n.\n4\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn particular the effective action is independent of the directions transverse to the\nsingularity, as is expected from the fact that the gauge fields are localized on the\nsix-dimensional hypersurface specified by p \u2282 Y . This gives a natural string theory\nrealization of the (possibly large) extra dimension scenario of [19].\nUpon compactification on the sphere B one obtains an N = 2 supersymmetric\nQFT with gauge group G in four dimensions. Dimensional reduction implies that\nthe four-dimensional tree level gauge coupling is given by the (complexified) K\u00e4hler\nvolume VB of B:\nZ\n4\u03c0i\n\u03b8F T\nBNS + i VB \u2261 s.\n(3.2)\n+ 2 =\n2\u03c0\ngF T\nB\nThe real part of s describes the integral of the Neveu-Schwarz B-field on the base\n2-sphere B.\nAt this point it seems useful to fix the notation for the coupling constants. In\nthe following we will refer to the field theory coupling constant s as \"the coupling\nconstant\" and use \"perturbative\" with respect to the the field theory which is designed\nto describe our world. The string theory embedding with s identical to the string\ncoupling constant is a heterotic string on K3\u00d7T 2 . It is dual [5][6] to the geometric\ntype II compactification where s is the geometric volume (3.2) and not the string\ncoupling. This is the usual story used in geometric engineering: we can calculate\nnon-perturbative phenomena of the effective field theory by using the geometric type\nII picture. In the present paper we extend this correspondence to also calculate nonperturbative quantities of the string effective supergravity theory to which the SYM\ntheory is coupled.\n7\n\nFor a basic introduction and further references, see [30].\n\n8\n\n\f3.2. The string effective supergravity\nThe four-dimensional tree level coupling (3.2) fixes the classical piece of the prepotential to be\nF = \u2212s Cij ti tj + . . . ,\n(3.3)\nwhere the dots denote \u03b1\u2032 and finite coupling corrections. It is easy to see that the string\neffective supergravity obtained from geometric engineering has precisely the property\nto allow for a partial supersymmetry breaking. In the inhomogenous coordinates ti , s,\nthe standard section \u03a0 = (X \u03a3 , \u2202F /\u2202X \u03a3) is\nX\nX \u03a3 = (1, s, ti),\nF\u03a3 = (2F \u2212 s Fs \u2212\ntk Fk , Fs , Fi ),\n(3.4)\nk\n\nwhere subscripts denote differentiation. From the prepotential (3.3) one obtains after\na simple symplectic transformation (s, Fs ) \u2192 (Fs , \u2212s) a section \u03a0\u0303 with\nP\nT\nT\nX\u0303 \u03a3 = ( 1, Fs , ti ) ,\nF\u0303\u03a3 = ( 2F \u2212 sFs \u2212 k tk Ftk , \u2212s, Fi ) ,\n(3.5)\nIn particular\n\nFs = \u2202F /\u2202s = \u2212Ckl tk tl .\n\n(3.6)\n\nNote that the X\u0303 \u03a3 do not depend on s and thus the necessary condition for partial\nsupersymmetry breaking is satisfied.\nHowever, as we argued on general grounds in section 2, instanton corrections will\nchange this picture. In the present situation the relevant instantons have an action\n\u223c e2\u03c0is which is characteristic of space-time instantons as interpreted in the field\ntheory. It is one of the most powerful aspects of the geometrically engineered quantum\nfield theories (GEQFT's) that one may determine these non-perturbative corrections\nfrom the dual, geometric type II instantons by mirror symmetry. We will use this\ninformation in the next section to study the pattern of supersymmetry breaking in the\nexact string effective supergravity theory.\n\n4. Non-perturbative supersymmetry breaking in the string effective theory\nApart from the vector multiplets, the general N = 2 supergravity can be coupled\nto N = 2 matter hypermultiplets. These couplings may generate a non-trivial scalar\npotential which determines the vacuum structure. We review a few facts and definitions in appendix A. In string theory these couplings may arise as the consequence of\nbackground fields such as RR fields in type II strings [13] and magnetic backgrounds\nin the heterotic string [14]. In the following we study the contribution of instanton\neffects in the presence of such backgrounds.\n9\n\n\f4.1. The SU (2) GEQFT on a compact manifold\nLet us first consider a global type II compactification associated to the SU (2)\nGEQFT as an explicit example for the supersymmetry breaking by instantons on a\ncompact manifold. It will be rather obvious how to generalize to the generic situation\nsubsequently.\nThe prepotential of the string effective supergravity is of the form\nF (s, t) = \u2212s(t2 + 1) \u2212 a t3 + b t + c + f (s, t),\n\na, b, ic \u2208 R.\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe modulus t is related to the single 2-sphere of the singularity supporting the SU (2)\ntheory. In the tree level approximation s \u2192 \u221e, eq.(4.1) is the same as (3.3) for\n\nG = SU (2) up to a shift of t by a constant. This shift is an effect of the global\ngeometry. It has no further consequences except for the translation of the origin\nof the SU (2) theory to t = i. The function f depends only on the exponentials\n(qs , qt ) = (e2\u03c0is , e2\u03c0it). The s-independent piece of F (s, t) describes one-loop effects in\nthe heterotic string theory whereas a term \u223c qsk corresponds to an k instanton effect.\n\nThe presence of background fields induces charges of a hypermultiplet w.r.t. to a\ngauge symmetry gauged by the vector multiplets. Let us first ask what kind of gauge\ncharges will be relevant. In the Super-Higgs effect, one gravitino becomes part of a\nmassive super multiplet with spin content (3/2, 1, 1, 1/2) [12]. It is natural to identify\nthese two spin one vectors with the ones in the universal sector of the graviphoton\nand the dilaton s, \u03a3 = 0, 1. Note that this choice is universal and is valid for any\ngauge group G. In addition there may be an ordinary Higgs effect in the magnetic\nfield theory U (1) factors related to the condensation of monopoles.\nTo proceed we perform a symplectic transformation on the standard section (3.4)\nand obtain a period vector \u03a0\u0303 of the form\n\u2212 21 (t2 \u2212 1) +\nX\u0303 \u03a3 = \uf8ed\n\u2212t\n1 2\n\u2212 2 (t + 1) +\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212t2 s + at3 \u2212 bt + s \u2212 2c \u2212 2f + tft + sfs\n\uf8f8 , F\u0303\u03a3 = \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\n\u22122ts + 3at2 + b + ft\n1\nt2 s \u2212 at3 + bt + s + 2c + 2f \u2212 tft \u2212 sfs\n2 fs\n(4.2)\nfs\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nThis basis is the equivalent of (3.5) in the global compactification. Note that the sdependend piece of X\u0303 \u03a3 is entirely due to the space-time instantons correction fs =\n\u2202f /\u2202s \u223c q s = e2\u03c0is + . . .. Therefore in the perturbative, tree-level plus one-loop\ncorrected supergravity, no prepotential exists and partial supersymmetry breaking\nappears to be possible.\n10\n\n\f4.2. Non-perturbative gravitino masses\nHowever, as asserted already, including the space-time instantons, the X \u03a3 should\nbe always good homogeneous coordinates and the arguments of the no-go theorem [10]\napply. To be concrete, let us consider a breaking to N = 1 near the origin t = i of\n\nthe field theory Coulomb branch. The gravitino mass matrix is proportional to the\nsupersymmetry variation SAB :\niSAB\n\ni\n= \u2212 eK/2\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nP01 \u2212 iP11 \u2212 iP01 \u2212 P12\n\u2212P03 + iP13\n\n\u2212P03 + iP13\n\u2212P01 + iP11 \u2212 iP02 \u2212 P12\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.3)\n\nA representative chocie for a breaking to N = 1 with a zero single eigenvalue of the\n\nmatrix S is\n\nP01 = P12 = m,\n\nP\u03a3x = 0 for \u03a3 = 0, 1, else.\n\n(4.4)\n\nWith this choice the mass matrix for generic moduli is\niSAB\n\nim eK/2\n=\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n(t \u2212 i)2 \u2212 fs\n0\n\n0\n\u2212(t + i)2 + fs\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.5)\n\nFor qs \u2192 0 there is a N = 1 vacuum at t = i. For qs 6= 0 the instantons lift the zero\n\neigenvalue. Since the no-go theorem applies, there must be either N = 2 or N = 0\nsupersymmetry. An N = 2 vacuum requires t = 0, fs = \u22121. Even if such a point in\n\nthe moduli space would exist, it would not be connected to the large s vacuum. Thus\nthe instantons break further N = 1 \u2192 N = 0 at a scale \u039b \u223c e\u22128\u03c0\n\n2\n\n/g 2\n\n.\n\nThe exciting fact about this instanton generated supersymmetry breaking is that\nthe non-perturbative effects are determined by mirror symmetry in the geometric type\nII theory. Since the non-perturbative gravitino masses arise from the coupling of the\nGEQFT to the string and gravity sector, the precise instanton series depends on the\nindividual compactification manifold M. As an example let us consider the mirror of\nthe Calabi\u2013Yau manifold8 M defined by the polynomial\n12\n6\n6\n2\n6 6\np = x12\n1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 \u2212 12 \u03bc x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 \u2212 2 \u03c6 x1 x2 .\n\n(4.6)\n\nHere the xi are coordinates of a weighted projective space in which M is embedded\nas the hypersurface p = 0 and (\u03bc, \u03c6) are coordinates on MV (W ) related to (t, s) by\n8\n\nThis Calabi\u2013Yau manifold served already as a prominent example in the understanding of\n\ntypeIIA/heterotic duality [5][31] and GEQFT's [32].\n\n11\n\n\fthe mirror map. By calculating the period integrals and using the mirror map9 we\nm(\u03c8)\nobtain the following result for the instanton expansion \u2206np = fs that governs the\nnon-perturbative gravitino masses:\n\nm(\u03c8)\n= e2\u03c0is (2+2496qt1+1941264qt2+1327392512qt3+861202986072qt4+540194037151104qt5+...) +\n\u2206np\n\ne4\u03c0is ( 21 +448128qt2 +2654785024qt3+5718020769540qt4+8494210810708992qt5+...) +\ne6\u03c0is ( 92 + 347738368\nqt3 +2583608958216qt4+12741316216063488qt5+...) +\n3\ne8\u03c0is ( 81 +36401011968qt4+2160776148604416qt5+...) +\n...\n(4.7)\nIt would be interesting to study the global non-perturbative vacuum structure using\nthis exact information. In fact the coefficient functions fk (qt ) of the k-th instanton\nterm are generally modular functions of the heterotic modular group, which is known\nfor certain compactifications10 . This information might be sufficient to determine\nglobal properties of the associated scalar potential. In the following we will take a\ndifferent route and analyze the vacuum structure directly in an expansion around the\npoint particle limit of the SYM theory.\n4.3. Generalizations\nIt is easy to argue that the pattern of non-perturbative supersymmetry breaking\ndescribed in the above SU (2) case is generic for any gauge group G. First note that\nwe used only the universal sector of the dilaton and the graviphoton in the gauging\nand the generalization to general G is therefore trivial. Consider now the electric\ncomponent X\u0303 \u03a3 of the field theory section (3.5). On general grounds it is clear that the\nentries 1 and ti will not receive s dependent instanton corrections. So the instanton\ncorrections that lift the N = 1 vacuum are entirely due to the modifications of the\nremaining period\n\nX\u0303 2 =\n\n\u2202F\n= \u2212Cij ti tj + . . . .\n\u2202s\n\n(4.8)\n\nThis period describes tree-level gauge kinetic terms, and its s corrections nonperturbative field theory corrections to it plus additional non-perturbative gravitational and string effects in the full theory. Thus on pure field theory grounds, the\n9\n10\n\nWe refer again to refs. [26][27] for details and references on calculations of this type.\nA study of the modular functions for special cases can be found in [33].\n\n12\n\n\fN = 1 vacuum will be lifted in any N = 2 QFT with non-perturbative corrections\ncoupled to string theory11 . The only case left over are conformal QFT's with the\nexact gauge coupling being equal to the tree level coupling. Still in this case we expect that, after adding the coupling to gravity and breaking of conformal invariance\nas a consequence, s dependent instantons appear in the string/gravity sector12 . It is\ninteresting to observe that the lift of the N = 1 vacuum seems to be closely related to\nthe breaking of conformal invariance.\n\n5. Supersymmetry breaking in the point particle limit\nIn the following we want to pin down the structure of supersymmetry breaking as\nseen by the low energy observable gauge theory. The string theory embedding predicts\na special form of the non-perturbative scalar potential of the low energy gauge theory\nwith the supersymmetry breaking parameters linked in a useful way to the string\ngeometric moduli.\n5.1. What can be expected from the field theory\nLet us first ask what might be expected from what is known about supersymmetry\nbreaking in field theory. Obviously, since we consider spontaneous breaking in the\nN = 2 supergravity theory which encodes the exact non-perturbative N = 2 SYM\ntheory, the supersymmetry breakdown should have a consistent formulation in terms\nof the latter. There are three known patterns of supersymmetry breaking consistent\nwith the holomorphic structure of the N = 2 theory.\nThe first one is the addition of the N = 1 supersymmetric adjoint mass term\ndiscussed in the original work of Seiberg and Witten [3]. It was argued there that this\nterm drives the theory to the point in the Coulomb moduli where the monopole gets\nmassless. The combined superpotenial including the monopole hypermultiplet (m, m\u0303)\nis\n\u221a\n(5.1)\nW = 2aD mm\u0303 + madj u.\nm\n\ndu\n, where\nThe minimum of the scalar potential is at aD = 0, m = m\u0303 = \u2212 \u221aadj\n2 daD\nthe monopole becomes massless and condenses. The condensation of the magnetically\n11\n\nWe emphasize once again that the no-go theorem applies to the string effective supergravity,\n\nnot to a pure field theory decoupled from string theory.\n12\n\nIt follows from the general arguments in section 2 that this is indeed the case.\n\n13\n\n\fcharged monopoles leads to a mass for the magnetic gauge field and confinement of\nthe electric fields \u00e0 la t'Hooft [2].\nAnother very elegant and interesting approach to supersymmetry breaking starting from the holomorphic properties of the N = 2 theory has been considered in\nrefs.[34]. Compatibility with the analycity properties of the exact field theory can be\nimplemented by the introduction of so-called spurion fields with vev's that trigger the\nbreaking. It was already argued there that the structure of the potential obtained in\nthis way is in qualitative agreement with what one expects from a supergravity theory.\nIndeed, we will find that the supersymmetry breaking in string theory is morally\na generalization of the two mechanisms13 . In particular the supersymmetry breaking\nparameters will depend in a specific way on the geometry of the transverse dimensions.\n5.2. String effective action\nTo study the string effective theory near the point particle limit, we consider an\n2\nexpansion in \u03b1\u2032 \u223c 1/Mstr\n, keeping the exact quantities including the infinite instanton\n\nseries at each order. This approach has been introduced in [32] to derive the non-\n\nperturbative field theory results from string theory. Specifically one considers the\nlimit of small \u01eb with\n\u039b\n= \u01eb,\nMstr\n\n\u039b \u223c Mstr e\u22128\u03c0\n\n2\n\n/b1 g 2\n\n= fixed,\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere b1 is the one loop beta coefficient of the SYM theory. Note that the tree\nlevel coupling g at the string scale - equal to the volume of the base B - behaves as\nIm s \u223c \u2212b1 ln \u01eb. It was further argued in [32] that in this limit the string effective\n\naction is described by a supergravity period vector \u03a0 with building blocks\n1, \u01eb ak , \u01eb akD , \u01eb2 u, s, \u01eb2 su,\n\nk = 1, . . . , r,\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere the ak (akD ) are the vev's of the scalar fields in the electric (magnetic) vector\nmultiplets of the SYM theory. A crucial fact for the following is the appearance of\nu = hTr \u03c62 i at order \u01eb2 . The dependence of \u03a0 on u will be generate the N = 1\nsupersymmetric mass term for the adjoint scalar in (5.1).\n\n13\n\nThere are extra terms that resemble the soft breaking terms of the N = 1 spurion approach\n\n[35].\n\n14\n\n\fThe structure of the string effective action around the field theory limit turns\nout to be quite intricate. We will banish details of the supergravity calculations in\nthe appendix and content ourself with an outline of the qualitative structure in the\nfollowing. We start with the following ansatz for the symplectic section \u03a0 = (X \u03a3 , F\u03a3 ):\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\u03b7\u03b1 f\u03b1 (s + const. )\nf\u03b1 + \u01eb2 c\u03b1 u\n\u03a3\n,\n(5.4)\n,\nF\u03a3 =\nX =\n\u01ebcakD\n\u01ebcak\nwhere \u03b7 = \u2212, +, +, . . .. The entries X \u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, . . . , 2 + m describe (together with the\ndual periods F\u03b1 ) the universal graviphoton/dilaton sector and m extra scalar fields\nta that parametrize the geometry of the transverse dimensions. On the other hand\nthe entries X k , Fk , k = 1, . . . , r are associated to the r = rk G field theory periods.\nThe expressions f\u03b1 , c\u03b1 are so far arbitrary functions of the moduli ta but will have\nto satisfy some constraints imposed on the section \u03a0 by N = 2 special geometry. The\nK\u00e4hler potential obtained from \u03a0 has the form\nK = \u2212ln(V) +\n\n\u01eb2\nK,\nV\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere the precise expression for K can be found in eq.(B.1) and the leading term is\nV = VB * VT V ,\nVB = i (s \u2212 s\u0304 + const. ) \u2261 \u03a3/2,\nX\nVT V = 2\n\u03b7\u03b1 |f\u03b1 |2 \u2261 2 \u03a9.\n\n(5.6)\n\n\u03b1\n\nIn fact V is the volume of the Calabi\u2013Yau manifold M . Note that the field theory\ndependent terms are contained in K and, apart from the inverse powers of Mstr , suppressed by the overall inverse power of the volume V. One can distinguish two different\ngeometric scales contained in V which will be enter the supersymmetry breaking scales\nin the following. These are the volume of the base VB \u223c \u03a3 \u223c ln \u01eb on which the gauge\nfields propagate and the volume VT V \u223c \u03a9 of the dimensions transverse to the field\ntheory.\n5.3. A first look at the scalar potential\nThe coupling of the hypermultiplets to the vector multiplets14 induces a nontrivial scalar potential V for the scalars [12]\nu\nv\nV = V\u03b4\u03a8 + V\u03b4\u03be + V\u03b4\u03bb = \u22123P\u03a3x P\u039b\u0304x V \u03a3\u039b\u0304 + 4k\u03a3\nhuv k\u039b\u0304\nV \u03a3\u039b\u0304 + P\u03a3x P\u039b\u0304x U \u03a3\u039b\u0304 ,\n14\n\nSee appendix A for more details.\n\n15\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fwhere the three terms are due to the gravitino, hyperino and gaugino variations,\nu\nrespectively. The couplings P\u03a3x , x = 1, 2, 3 (and k\u03a3\n) describe the interactions of the\nu\nhypermultiplets q with the four-dimensional vector multiplet A\u03a3\n\u03bc , where \u03a3 is a gauge\nindex and x an index of the SU (2)R symmetry. In the present context the couplings\nP\u03b1x in the universal dilaton/graviphoton sector parametrize the Super-Higgs effect\ndiscussed in the previous section. Since we will be interested in a region of the field\ntheory moduli space where the monopoles are light, we must also add their couplings\nto the magnetic U (1) factors of the field theory15 . If (mi , m\u0303i ), i = 1, . . . , r denote the\nr = rk G monopole hypermultiplets with charges qki , these couplings are described by\nPkx = Qxk with\n \u0304 i )T .\n\u01eb\u22122 Qxk = qki (m\u0304i , m\u0303i ) \u03c3 x (mi , m\u0303\n(5.8)\nThe matrices U and V depend on the scalars zi in the vector multiplets. As their\ngeneral form is quite involved we will restrict to give explicit expressions along the\nway when needed.\nThe cosmological term\nThe leading term in the scalar potential arises from the Super\u2013Higgs effect in the\nuniversal sector and does not depend on the field theory moduli. It represents the\ncosmological constant from the view of the brane world. Its moduli dependence is\ndescribed by the \u01eb0 -piece of the matrices U and V :\ne\u2212K V0\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 = f\u03b1 f \u0304\u03b2\n\ne\u2212K U0\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 = w\u03b1,\u03c1 g \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 w\u0304\u03b2\u0304,\u03c1\u0304\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere we used t\u03c1 = {ta , s} to denote the non field theory moduli and w\u03b1,\u03c1 = K\u03c1 f\u03b1 +\nf\u03b1,\u03c1 . To avoid a cosmological constant of the order of the string scale, the sum of\nthe leading contributions from the gravitino, hyperino and gaugino variations in (5.7)\nshould vanish. There are various possibilities to achieve such a cancellation at special\nvalues of the vector and/or hypermultiplets.\nIn the following we will mostly separate the question of why the cosmological\nconstant is so small compared to Msusy from the study of the pattern supersymmetry\nbreaking on the brane as a function of the couplings P\u03b1x that determine the Super\u2013\nHiggs effect. Note that providing a solution to the cosmological constant problem in\nthe present context would be rather significant as even non-perturbative effects are\n15\n\nWe will write all following equations in the appropriate local magnetic variables which are\n\nequal to akD = \u2202/\u2202ak F in the UV region.\n\n16\n\n\fincluded. Although we will not solve the problem of the cosmological constant we\nwill observe some interesting interrelations between the supersymmetry breaking on\nthe brane and the cosmological term and keep an eye on possible mechanisms for a\ncancellation of the latter.\nThe N = 1 preserving adjoint mass term\nLet us consider for a moment a naive cancellation of the individual contributions to\nthe cosmological term by imposing\nP\u03b1x * w\u03b1,\u03c1 = 0,\n\nP\u03b1x * f\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(5.10)\n\nAssuming that eq.(5.10) holds, one finds for the leading piece of the scalar potential\nin the field theory limit:\n\u01eb\u22124 V =\n\n1 X x\n(Ql + mxadj ul ) \u03c4 lk\u0304 (Qxk + m\u0304xadj \u016bk\u0304 )\n2 x\n\n(5.11)\n\n+ 2 qli qki al ak\u0304 (|mi |2 + |m\u0303i |2 ),\nwhere\nmxadj\n\nP\u03b1x c\u03b1\n= Mstr *\n.\nc\n\n(5.12)\n\nEq. (5.11) describes precisely the scalar potential of the N = 2 field theory with a\n\nmass term \u223c madj for the adjoint scalars in the vector multiplets. As argued in ref.[3],\nthe N = 2 theory is driven to the point al = 0, \u2200l in the Coulomb moduli, where r\np\nmutually local monopoles become massless and condense with a vev \u223c madj \u039b in a\nnew N = 1 supersymmetric vacuum.\nRelations from special geometry and breaking to N = 0\nImposing the condition (5.10) not only cancels the leading order contribution to the\nscalar potential but also a number of extra terms at O(\u01eb4 ). As the expression in\n\neq.(5.11) is the most general one compatible with N = 1 supersymmetry these terms\nmust necessarily break N = 1 \u2192 N = 0 in the SYM theory.\n\nAn generic solution to (5.10) is the limit of infinitely large extra dimensions, as will\nbe discussed below. It might appear that partial supersymmetry breaking to N = 1\nwith the adjoint mass term (5.12) is possible for any such solution. However this is in\nfact not true. The reason is that the general ansatz (5.4) for the supergravity section\n\u03a0 must be subject to further conditions in order that \u03a0 is a valid symplectic section\n17\n\n\fof N = 2 special geometry. In the appendix B we find that these relations have the\nimportant implication\n\nP\u03b1x * f\u03b1 = 0 \u21d2 mxadj \u223c P\u03b1x * c\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(5.13)\n\nThus cancellation of the N = 1 supersymmetry breaking terms at O(\u01eb4 ) implies also\nthe cancellation of the leading N = 1 adjoint mass term. Therefore, contrary to what\nmight have been naively expected, there will be no excessively large separation of the\n\ntwo breaking scales to N = 1 and N = 0, respectively.\nAs we pointed out already, the no-go theorem in the string effective supergravity does not imply a no-go theorem for the pure field theory completely decoupled\nfrom string theory. This decoupling can be achieved by taking a strictly infinite string\nscale Mstr = \u221e which, by eq.(5.2), amounts to a non-compact limit in the (tangen-\n\ntial) direction of the base. In this case certain terms dressed by inverse powers of\n\u03a3 \u223c ln \u039b/Mstr drop from the effective field theory potential and eq.(5.10) can be re-\n\nplaced by a weaker condition that can be satisfied and connects to the N = 1 pure\n\nfield theory vacuum discussed in [23]. However note that in the field theory coupled to\nstring theory the phenomenologically acceptable regime is ln \u039b/Mstr\n\n\u223c\n<\n\n20 and super-\n\nsymmetry is broken by the terms with extra powers of \u03a3 (and in fact we will argue\nthat the phenomenologically interesting region is in the range of moderately small \u03a3).\nThis leads again to a quite restricted hierarchy for the breaking scales to N = 1 and\nN = 0, respectively\n\nIn appendix B we collect a few additional relations derived from special geometry\nwhich contain some useful information. In particular they imply that the scale of the\nsupersymmetry breaking is given by\nmQ \u223c b1 *\n\nP\u03b1 f \u03b1\n,\n\u03a9\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhich is also equal to the scale of the monopole condensate. The fact that mQ is\nproportional to the one-loop beta function coefficient fits well the discussion in section\n4.3 where we observed that the supersymmetry breakdown is apparently linked to\nthe violation of conformal invariance. Moreover eq.(5.14) displays the important fact\nthat the supersymmetry breaking scale tends to be suppressed by the volume of the\ntransverse dimensions.\n18\n\n\fNon-compact transverse dimensions\nThe defining data of the string effective theory is is the period vector \u03a0 of a K3 fibered\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifold. A special property of the leading periods f\u03b1 in the universal\nsector is that they are free of any instanton corrections arising from a finite transverse\nvolume \u03a9. The reason is that these s-independent pieces are identical to the periods of\na K3 manifold which is of the same type as the generic fiber in the fibration. Moreover\non the K3 manifold there are no instanton corrections to the period integrals as a\nconsequence of the (4, 4) supersymmetry of the CFT. Explicitly this means that the\nperiods f\u03b1 are polynomial in the ta of degree two with the precise form dictated by\nthe K3 intersection matrix. Note that there are instanton corrections with an action\nproportional to the K\u00e4hler volumes {ta } in the K3 fibration.\nObviously, a solution to both conditions in (5.10) can not exist for generic moduli. It would be interesting to classify possible solutions on sub-slices of the moduli\nof all K3's, which would be tantamount for finding solutions for a vacuum with vanishing leading cosmological constant. In the next section we will study in detail the\ndependence of the scalar potential on the universal volume modulus t of the transverse dimensions. In this case it is easy to verify that the only solution to (5.10) is\nthe limit of infinitely large transverse dimensions, t = \u221e. For the reasons described\nabove this does not lead to partial supersymmetry breaking, however. Note that noncompact transverse volume should not be confused with the pure field theory case,\nwhich requires infinitely large tangential dimensions VB \u223c ln \u039b/Mstr \u2192 \u221e.\n\n6. Supersymmetry breaking on the brane\nAfter having outlined some general features we give now details of the supersymmetry breaking in the effective SYM theory on the brane as a function of the couplings\nP\u03b1x parametrizing the Super\u2013Higgs effect in the universal string sector16 . For concreteness we will restrict the description of the deformations of the transverse geometry to\nthe generic volume modulus t. Introducing extra moduli will not change the effective\ntheory in the sector of the SYM theory; the way that these extra moduli enter is in\nthe leading, cosmological term.\n16\n\nNote that the following expressions describe the supersymmetry breaking on the brane for\n\narbitrary general couplings and thus the distinction of patterns with partial or complete classical\nSuper-Higgs effect in the string sector arises only after making a specific choice for them.\n\n19\n\n\fThe universal sector of the graviphoton, the dilaton and the universal modulus t\nis described by the following ansatz for the functions f\u03b1 :\nf0 =\n\n1\n(1 + t2 ),\n2\n\nf1 =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 t2 ),\n2\n\nf2 = t.\n\n(6.1)\n\nMoreover it follows from the relations of special geometry that the coefficients of the\nu dependent terms in the symplectic section (5.4) are\nc0 = \u2212b,\n\nc1 = b,\n\nc2 = 0,\n\nc\u03040 = \u2212c0 ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere b \u223c b1 with a numerical coefficient specified in (B.5). With this information\none can determine the matrices U and V and the scalar potential eq.(5.7). Since its\ngeneral form is at first sight involved, we will perform the analysis in various steps.\n6.1. Leading terms in a large \u03a3 expansion\nLet us start with the leading terms of the field theory potential in an expansion\nin powers of\nb1\n\u03a3 = \u2212 ln \u039b/Mstr .\n(6.3)\n\u03c0\nThe motivation for this expansion is that for a very large string scale, the terms with\nlower powers of \u03a3 are suppressed17 . In particular the pure field theory potential will\ncorrespond to keeping only the leading terms in the limit \u03a3 = \u221e. However for the\ntheory coupled to gravity, the logarithmic dependence on Mstr implies relative small\nvalues of \u03a3 bounded from above by the value \u223c 10 b1 for Mstr \u223c Mpl . In fact, as we\nwill argue that the supersymmetry breaking scale is proportional to the string scale\nand moreover the latter can well be in the TeV range in this \"world on a brane\"\nscenario, the value of \u03a3 can be actually quite small for a moderate to low value of the\nstring scale. In this case the terms with lower powers in \u03a3 are relevant. However we\nfind it still useful to display the structure of the potential by organizing it in powers\nof \u03a3, keeping in mind that this will only give a good physical hierarchy for extremely\nlarge values of Mstr .\nFrom the general expressions in appendix C one obtains the following leading term\nof the scalar potential in the SYM theory:\n17\n\nIn fact the relative contribution of these terms might be underestimated by the naive formula\n\n(6.3), since it does not take into account threshold effects which are known to be sizable in string\ntheory compactifications with large compact dimensions.\n\n20\n\n\f\u01eb\u22124 V =\n\n1 3\n1 \u2212\n+\n3\nlk\u0304\n3\n3\n{Ql + Ml\u2212 } \u03c4 lk\u0304 {Q+\nk + Mk } + {Ql + Ml } \u03c4 {Qk + Mk }\n2\n2\n+ 2 qli qki al ak\u0304 (|mi |2 + |m\u0303i |2 )\n\u2212\u03b1\n\n(6.4)\n\nib\ni\n(us \u2212 \u016bs\u0304 ) + ( \u03b2us + c.c.).\n2\n2\u03a9\n2\u03a9\n\nHere the superscripts \u00b1 refer to complex combinations x1 \u00b1 ix2 of the real fields.\ni i i\nIn particular Q\u2212\nl = 2m m\u0303 ql is the holomorphic bilinear in the monopole fields and\n\u2212 \u2217\nQ+\nl = (Ql ) .

On the other hand, the harmonic piece\nmN =1 =\n\nb \u2212\nP f\u03b1\nc\u03a9 \u03b1\ninduces a soft breaking of supersymmetry.\nmN =0 =\n\n(6.7)\n\nii) D \u2212 type terms:\nThe alignment of the vev's of the scalar components of the individual chiral N = 1\nmultiplets in the monopole hypermultiplet are determined by the remaining component Ml3 = \u03b6ul + c.c. with\nb 3 \u0304\nP f\u1fb1 .\n(6.8)\n\u03b6=\nc\u03a9 \u03b1\niii) Remaining terms:\nIn addition there are further soft-breaking terms that depend on us with coefficients\n1\n\u03a92 2 1\n\u03b1 = 2 |c| ( |mN =0 |2 + |mN =0 + mN =1 |2 + |\u03b6|2 ),\nb\n2\n2\n1\n\u03a9 1\n\u03b2 = ( c(mN =1 + mN =0 ) C + + c\u0304m\u0304N =0 C \u2212 \u2212 c\u03b6C 3 ),\nb 2\n2\n21\n\n(6.9)\n\n\fwhere C x = P\u03b1x c\u03b1 . A nice heuristic interpretation of these terms can be given as\nfollows. Let us consider the N = 1 supersymmetric term in (6.5). In the field theory\n\nthis term can be associated with a superpotential term u mN =1 in eq.(5.1). At the\npoint where the N = 1 vacuum branches off, u = \u03c9G \u039b2 , where \u03c9G is a c2 (G)-th root\n\nof unity. Moreover the scale of the N = 1 theory is related to that of the N = 2\ntheory by \u039b3N =1 = mN =1 \u039b2 . Thus the superpotential term u mN =1 , evaluated at the\nN = 1 point of the Coulomb branch is\nW = \u03c9G \u039b3N =1 .\n\n(6.10)\n\nSo remarkably enough, evaluating the superpotential of ref.[3] at the extremum with\nrespect to the SYM fields, gives precisely the expected dynamical generated superpotential in the N = 1 theory. In the string theory context there are further\ncontributions from the superpotential (6.10) to the scalar potential because \u039b \u223c ei\u03b3s\n\nis to be treated as a field rather than a constant. These terms have the form of the\nus dependent terms in the scalar potential (6.4).\nTo determine the scale of supersymmetry breaking, note that \u2202\u03c4 lk\u0304 /\u2202an is very large in\na region with light monopoles, ak \u223c 0. As a consequence, minimization with respect to\nthe fields ak will require an adjustment of the monopole bilinears Qxl \u223c Mlx to a high\n\nprecision. Thus the generic scale of the monopole condensate and the supersymmetry\nbreakdown is given by\nMsusy \u223c\n\nb1\nb1 x\nP\u03b1 f\u03b1 Mstr \u223c Mstr ,\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhere in the second expression we have assumed that the couplings in the universal\nstring sector are of order one in string units. As we will discuss in the next section,\nthis is indeed the case if these couplings P\u03b1x arise from certain background fields in the\nstring theory compactification.\nThe N = 1 pure field theory vacuum 18\nIf we are not interested in string theory but pure field theory, we can take the decoupling limit of infinite string mass which implies \u03a3 \u2192 \u221e by eq.(5.2). Only the\nleading terms (6.4) survive in this pure field theory case. This case was considered in\n[23] and it was asserted that a solution with N = 1 supersymmetry exists. Note that\n18\n\nI thank Cumrun Vafa for conversations on the following issues.\n\n22\n\n\fthere are many choices for the Super\u2013Higgs effect that lead to partial supersymmetry\nbreaking in the classical supergravity and break the remaining supersymmetry only\nby instanton effects. However only a very special subset will be related to a vacuum\nof the N = 1 pure field theory at Mstr = \u221e.\nA choice of or RR-fluxes (or Super\u2013Higgs effect) that cancels all supersymmetry\nbreaking terms in the leading part of the potential must correspond to \u03b6 = mN =0 = 0\nand values for \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that the last terms in (6.4) cancel. From eqs.(6.7) \u2013 (6.9)\nwe find that the solution is given by\nP0\u2212 = \u2212\n\n1 + t20 \u2212\nP ,\n1 \u2212 t20 1\n\nP2\u2212 =\n\n2t0\nP \u2212,\n1 \u2212 t20 1\n\nP\u03b13 = 0, \u2200\u03b1.\n\n(6.12)\n\nThe meaning of this equations is that for fixed t0 , the choice (6.12) of the Super\u2013Higgs\ncancels the supersymmetry breaking terms in the leading potential at t = t0 .\nLet us summarize some relevant properties of the solution (6.12) that represents\na special configuration of RR-fluxes that preserve N = 1 in the decoupled field theory\n\nat Mstr = \u221e. (1) It corresponds to a special fine tuning of fluxes dual to 0, 2\n\nand 4-form charges on the non-compact manifold. The leading contribution in the\n\nnon-compact transverse limit relevant for geometric engineering of N = 1 QFT's is\n\nfrom the flux dual to the 0 and 4-form charges (this outcome is slightly different\n\nfrom the 2-form flux proposed in [23]). (2) The solution exists already at finite t.\nThe relevant decoupling is due to the infinite volume of the dimension parallel to\nthe brane, Im s \u223c ln \u039b/Mstr \u2192 \u221e which gives an infinite mass to the string states.\n\nThis is in nice agreement with our previous assertion that the breaking to N = 0 is\n\nindeed only due to the s-dependent instantons in the string sector, which are nonperturbative in the field theory coupling (rather than instantons from the, in string\n\nunits, finite transverse volume). (3) For finite Mstr there are extra terms discussed in\nthe next section that come with additional powers of 1/\u03a3 and break supersymmetry.\nCanceling the leading terms by (6.12) leads to an extra logarithmic dependence of\nthe supersymmetry breaking scale on Mstr . It is interesting to mention that the\noverall coefficient of these subleading terms depends on the hypermultiplet involved\nin the Super\u2013Higgs effect (the value of \u03bb defined in the next paragraph). For the\nhypermultiplet involved in the string theory Super\u2013Higgs effect this coefficient is nonzero [13][36]. If the coefficient would have been zero, supersymmetry breaking would\nhave been postponed to the next order of \u039b/Mstr .\n23\n\n\f6.2. Subleading terms and a vanishing leading cosmological constant\nSubleading terms in the \u03a3 expansion can be straightforwardly added using the\nexpressions in appendix C. For the purpose of displaying their structure however it is\nuseful to temporarily make a concrete and simple choice for the Super\u2013Higgs effect.\nFor a physically motivated illustration let us cancel the leading cosmological constant\nin the large volume limit by imposing eq.(5.10) on the leading terms. This is achieved\nby\nP01 = P11 \u2261 m/Mstr ,\nP\u03b1x = 0, else,\n(6.13)\nwere we have used a SU (2) rotation to fix the direction of the triplet of Killing prepotentials. To treat the hyperino contribution in (5.7) on the same footing with the\nu\nv\ngaugino and gravitino we will use the relation k\u03a3\nhuv k\u039b\n= \u03bbP\u039bx P\u03a3x . This simplification is justified for the couplings in string theory with \u03bb = 4, as will be outlined in\nthe next section.

The first two lines of eq.(6.14) have the form of soft breaking\nterms generated by the spurion approach of [34]. The term in the third line is of the\nform generated by the N = 1 spurion of [35]. The coefficients of these breaking terms\nare related in the string effective theory which can be thought of explicitly determining\nthe vev's of the spurion fields. The fourth line contains some additional soft breaking\nterms.\nNote that the N = 1 adjoint mass term is absent only because of the choice of\ncouplings (6.13) and as a consequence of eqs.(5.12) and (6.2).\n24\n\n\f6.3. Minima of the potential\nUltimately, all moduli including the numerical values of \u03a3 and \u03a9 should be fixed\nby the minima of the potential. The minimization with respect to the field theory\nmoduli is relatively straightforward and reduces approximately to Qxl \u223c Mlx with\nsmall corrections from the additional finite terms near the monopole point. In the\n\nspecial case with mN =1 = 0 above, the leading potential in a large \u03a3 expansion is\nof the form of the soft supersymmetry breaking considered in refs.[34], which include\na detailed numeric study of the vacuum structure for the gauge group SU (2). By\ncomparison, the spurion vev should be identified with the scale Msusy in (6.11).\nTo determine the string vacuum, one needs also to vary with respect to the dilaton\ns and the transverse volume modulus t. This brings us back to the question of the\ncosmological term. We will not solve the question of minimization for these fields,\nwhich we leave for the future, but point out some qualitative features. As for the\ndilaton, a stabilization is possible due to the subleading terms in \u03a3 with explicit s\ndependence. Note that there are also further calculable terms at order \u01eb6 and higher\nwhich depend non-trivially on s. Thus although we do not know in the moment which\nvalue of s corresponds to a minimum, there is no obstruction in principle to answer\nthis question.\nA similar situation holds for the volume modulus t of the large extra dimensions.\nFor a fixed Msusy \u223c 1TeV, the behavior of the typical inverse radius vs. Mstr is plotted\nin the figure below.\n\n1e+14\n8e+13\n\n1/R 6e+13\n4e+13\n2e+13\n0\n2e+14\n\n4e+14\n\n6e+14\n\nM_str\n\n25\n\n8e+14\n\n1e+15\n\n\f\u22121\nIn particular, for small a Mstr in the TeV range, the average radius is close to Mstr\n\nwhile it is larger by a factor of \u223c 104 for a string scale equal to the Planck scale.\n\nSince the scale of supersymmetry breaking is Msusy \u223c VT\u22121\nV one suspects there is no\n\nlocal minimum for the volume modulus and thus t will run away to infinity to restore\nsupersymmetry. A natural idea to fix the minimization of the transverse volume is\nto link it to the minimization of the field theory moduli space [37]. In other words,\nwe can use, as in the compactification discussed in section 4, the fact that the volume\nmodulus itself can correspond to one of the vev's of the field theory gauge group. Since\nthe transverse volume is of order one in string units in such a model, one expects a\nrelation\nMsusy \u223c Mstr \u223c R\u22121 .\n\n(6.16)\n\nTherefore this class of compactifications requires the string scale to be equal to the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale in the TeV range and predicts it to be equal to the scale\nof the extra large dimensions.\n\n7. Geometric charges in string theory and why Mstr should be small\nIn the previous sections we have described the supersymmetry breakdown as a\nconsequence of a Super-Higgs effect in the universal sector, parametrized by the couplings P\u03b1x . Let us finally comment on some important details of the relation of these\ncouplings to the background fields in string theory.\nIn ref.[13] it was shown that backgrounds of RR 2p-forms in the type IIA theory\ninduce charges of the dilaton hypermultiplet w.r.t. a gauge symmetry of the vector\nmultiplets specified by the cohomology class of the background. From the equations\nin [13] it also follows that \u03bb = 4 for this case. Due to the special property of the RR\nsector in the type II theory these couplings are suppressed by a factor of the string\ncoupling \u03bbII .\nThis is an extremely important detail from the world on a brane point of view\nsince i) the string scale Mstr may be in the TeV range in this scenario[38]; ii) the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale (6.11) is of the order of Mstr rather than Mpl . In fact\nthe relation between these two scales is given by dimensional reduction as\n2\nMpl\n\u223c\n\n\u03a3\u03a9 2\nM .\n\u03bb2II str\n26\n\n(7.1)\n\n\fThe special origin of the SYM theory - its origin in the RR sector which makes its\ncoupling independent of \u03bbII and its localization on a hypersurface which makes its\ncoupling independent of the transverse volume \u03a9 - has the consequence that the values\nof \u03a9 and \u03bbII remain largely undetermined by phenomenological requests. This allows\nfor a large separation of the string scale and the Planck scale arising from a large\ntransverse volume \u03a9 and/or a small string coupling \u03bbII .\nAfter supersymmetry breaking, even a small mismatch in the cancellation of the\ncosmological constant in the field theory will drive the string scale to as small a value\nas possible. In other words not only is it consistent to have strings at the TeV scale\nin this world on a brane scenario, but, after the supersymmetry breakdown, a low\nstring scale may well be energetically favored. In fact the solution to the cosmological\nconstant problem should tell us why Mstr \u223c a few TeV instead of being zero.\nHidden sectors\nA type IIB version of the backgrounds of ref.[13], with a generalization to also include NS backgrounds has been given in refs.[36][23]19 . In ref.[23] the coupling of the\nuniversal hypermultiplet to the vector gauge symmetries was derived from the BPS\ntension of NS and RR 5 branes in the presence of such backgrounds. As the tension of\nthe NS brane lacks the suppression factor \u03bbII , NS backgrounds will naturally lead to\na supersymmetry breaking scale \u223c Mpl . A low supersymmetry breaking scale could\nstill be obtained by breaking first supersymmetry on a \"hidden singularity\" and then\ntransmitting the breakdown by gravitational interactions to the observable branes,\nsimilarly as in refs.[1].\nOutlook\nUsing the appropriate geometric singularities of ref.[17], there are no obvious obstacles\nto model a N = 2 supersymmetric string theory embedding of the gauge group of the\n19\n\nTo compare the results of these two papers, which in fact seem to disagree in that the scalar\n\npotential of the [23] is SL(2, Z) invariant whereas the one of [36] is not, one needs to rewrite\nthe N = 2 scalar potential in terms of a N = 1 superpotential, a task that appears to have\nbeen settled only in very special cases, see [39]. We propose the general form of the N = 1\nsuperpotential to be W = P\u03a3 X \u03a3 \u2212 P\u0303 \u03a3 F\u03a3 , where P\u03a3 = P\u03a31 + iP\u03a32 is the complex combination of\nthe real Killing prepotentials and we have included a similar term P\u0303 \u03a3 for the couplings to the\nmagnetic fields to ensure symplectic covariance. To verify the consistency of this ansatz, the use\nof the supersymmetric Ward-identity in eq.(2.97) of ref.[40] is essential.\n\n27\n\n\fstandard model on a brane and its matter spectrum. Breaking supersymmetry in the\nway described in this paper leads to a generalized, calculable scalar potential depending\non the parameters of this \"standard model\". Apart from questions of details, e.g. how\nnatural the standard model spectrum appears in the context of geometric singularities,\nhigher derivative corrections etc, this appears to be an unexpectedly accomplishable\nscenario for the study of a phenomenologically relevant string vacuum with calculable,\ndynamically fixed mass and coupling parameters.\n\nAcknowledgments:\nI am grateful to Sheldon Katz, Wolfgang Lerche and Cumrun Vafa for essential comments and conversations.
