This allows us to prove that C \u221e volume preserving\nvector fields are C 1 -dense in C 1 volume preserving vector fields1 . Moreover, we obtain that C 1 robustly transitive conservative flows in threedimensional manifolds are Anosov and we conclude that there are no\ngeometrical Lorenz-like sets for conservative flows. Also, by-product of\nthe version of our pasting lemma for conservative diffeomorphisms, we\nshow that C 1 -robustly transitive conservative C 2 -diffeomorphisms admits\na dominated splitting, thus solving a question posed by Bonatti-DiazPujals. In particular, stably ergodic diffeomorphisms admits a dominated\nsplitting.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a preliminary version of a work in progress. So, we have to explain why\nwe are writing it. The explanation is somewhat simple: in the present work\nwe proved some results concerning some \"pasting\" (perturbation) lemma which\nwere used by another researchers, although there is not even a preprint version\nof the theorems. However, the disadvantage of this preliminary version is that\nit is too close to a draft of the theorems that we hope to prove in a (if possible)\nnear by future. But, we point out that the results below are correct, although\nsome of them need a refinement. In particular, the suggestions of the readers of\nthis \"pre-preprint\" certainly will help in order to improve this material.\nThe main technical result in this work is a general tool for perturbing C 2\nconservative dynamical systems over (large) compact subsets of phase space,\nobtaining a globally defined and still conservatove perturbations of the original\nsystem. In fact, we give several versions of this pasting lemmas, for discrete as\nwell as for continuous time systems (and in this case is enough suppose that\nthe system is C 1 ). Before hand, let us describe some of its consequences in\ndynamics.\n\u2217 A.\n\nArbieto is supported by CNPq-Brazil and Faperj-Brazil\nMatheus is supported by Faperj-Brazil\n1 After the conclusion of this work, Ali Tahzibi pointed out to us that this result was proved\nin 1979 by Carlos Zuppa, although his proof is different from ours.\n\u2020 C.\n\n1\n\n\fRobustly transitive diffeomorphisms\nA dynamical system is robustly transitive if any C 1 nearby one has orbits\nthat are dense in the whole ambient space. Recall that a dominated splitting is\na continuous decomposition T M = E \u2295 F of the tangent bundle into continuous\nsubbundles which are invariant under the derivative Df and such that Df |E\nis more expanding/less contracting than Df |F by a definite factor (see precise\ndefinitions and more history on section 5).\nWe prove: \"Let f : M \u2192 M a C 2 volume preserving diffeomorphism robustly transitive among volume preserving diffeomoorphisms. Then f amits a\ndominated splitting of the tangent bundle\". This is an extension of a theorem\nby Bonatti, Diaz and Pujals.\nRobustly transitive vector fields\nFirst we prove an extension of a theorem by Doering in the conservative setting: \"Let X be a divergent free vector field robustly transitive among divergent\nfree vector fields in a three dimensional manifold then X is Anosov.\nIt has been show by Morales-Pac\u0131\u0301fico and Pujals [MPP] that robustly transitive sets \u039b of a 3-dimensional flows are singular hyperbolic: tehre exists a\ndominated splitting of the tangent bundle restricted to \u039b such that the onedimensional subbundle is hyperbolic(contracting or expanding and the complementary one is volume hyperbolic. Robust transitivity means that \u039b is the\nmaximal invariant set in a neighborhood U and, for any C 1 neasrby vector field,\nthe maximal invariant set inside contains dense orbits.\nFor generic dissipative flows robust transitivity can not imply hyperbolicity,\nin view of the phenomenom of Lorenz-like attractors containing both equilibria\nand regular orbits. However we also prove that Lorenz-like sets do not exist for\nconsevative flows: \"If \u039b is a robust transitive set within divergent free vector\nfields then \u039b contains no equilibrium points.\n\n2\n\nThe Pasting Lemmas\n\nBefore stating the main results of this section, the pasting lemmas, we recall\nthe following results from PDE's by Dacorogna-Moser [DM, Theorem 2] on the\ndivergence equation:\nTheorem\n2.1. Let \u03a9 a manifold with C \u221e boundary. Let g \u2208 C k+\u03b1 (\u03a9) such\nR\nthat \u03a9 g = 0. Then there exist v a C k+1+\u03b1 vector field (with the same regularity\nat the boundary) such that:\n\u001a\ndiv v(x) = g(x), x \u2208 \u03a9\nv(x) = 0, x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\nFurthermore there exist C = C(\u03b1, k, \u03a9) > 0 such that kvkk+1+\u03b1 \u2264 Ckgkk+\u03b1 .\nAlso if g is C \u221e then v is C \u221e .\nRemark 2.2. In fact Dacorogna-Moser shows this result for open sets in Rn .\nBut the same methods works for manifolds with boundaries, because it follows\n2\n\n\ffrom the solvability of \u25b3u = f with Neumann's condition (see [DM, p.3] or [H,\np.265]; see also [Au, Ch 4,Theorem 4.8], [GT] and [LU]).\nA similar result holds for diffeomorphisms, as showed by Dacorogna-Moser [DM,\nTheorem 1, Lemma 4] (see also [RY]):\nTheorem 2.3. Let \u03a9 a manifold with C \u221e boundary. Let f, g \u2208 C k+\u03b1 (\u03a9) such\nthat f, g > 0. Then there exist \u03c6 a C k+1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism (with the same\nregularity at the boundary) such that:\n\u001a\ng(\u03c6(x)) det(D\u03c6(x)) = \u03bbf (x), x \u2208 \u03a9\n\u03c6(x) = x, x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\nR\nR\nwhere \u03bb = g/ f . Furthermore there exist C = C(\u03b1, k, \u03a9) > 0 such that\nk\u03c6kk+1+\u03b1 \u2264 Ckf \u2212 gkk+\u03b1 . Also if f, g are C \u221e then \u03c6 is C \u221e .\nRemark 2.4. A consequence of the Dacorogna-Moser's theorem is the fact of\n(M ) is path connected.\nDiff 1+\u03b1\n\u03c9\nWe now state the pasting lemma:\nTheorem 2.5 (C 1 -Pasting Lemma for vector fields). Given \u03b5 > 0 there\nexists \u03b4 > 0 such that if X \u2208 X1m (M ), K a compact set and Y \u2208 X1+\u03b1\nm (M ) is \u03b4C 1 -close to X on a small neighborhood U of K then there exist a Z \u2208 X1+\u03b1\nm (M )\nand V such that K \u2282 V \u2282 U satisfying Z|V = Y and Z is \u03b5-C 1 -close to X. If\n\u221e\nY \u2208 X\u221e\nm (M ) then Z is also in Xm (M ).\nProof. Let V a neighborhood of K with C \u221e boundary, compactly contained in\nU such that V and int(U c ) is a covering of M . Let \u03be1 and \u03be2 a partition of\nunity subordinated to this covering such that \u03be1 |V = 1 and there exist W \u2282 U c\nsuch that \u03be2 |W = 1. Let \u03a9 = M \\V \u222a W a manifold with C \u221e boundary and we\nfix C as the constant given by theorem 2.1.\nNow we choose \u03b40 such that if Y0 is \u03b40 -C 1 -close to X0 then T = \u03be1 Y0 + \u03be2 X0\n\u03b50\n\u03b50\nis 2 -C 1 -close to X0 and if we get g = div T then g is 2C\n-C 1 -close to 0. Indeed,\n1\nwe note that g = \u2207\u03be1 * Y0 + \u2207\u03be2 * X0 is C -close to 0 if we get Y0 sufficiently\nC 1 -close to X0 . Also weR note that by the divergence theorem (see the proof of\nthe theorem 3.1 below) \u03a9 g = 0. Clearly, g is a C \u221e function.\nSo we get v the vector field given by the theorem 2.1 and extend as 0 in the\nrest of the manifold this is a C \u221e -vector field (because we have regularity of v\nat the boundary) and let Z0 = T \u2212 v so this a C \u221e -vector field \u03b50 -C 1 -close to\nX0 which satisfies the statement of the theorem.\nUsing the same arguments of Dacorogna-Moser, we can produce perturbation\nin higher topologies, provided that the original systems are smooth enough. We\ncan sumarize this as:\nTheorem 2.6 (Pasting Lemma with Higher Differentiability). Let X \u2208\nXk+\u03b1\n(M ) (k integer, 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 and k + \u03b1 > 1). Fix K \u2282 U a neighborhood\n\u03c9\nof a compact set K. Let Y be a vector field defined in U1 \u2282 U , U1 an open set\ncontaining K. If Y \u2208 Xk+\u03b1\n(M ) is sufficiently C r -close to f for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 k + \u03b1\n\u03c9\n3\n\n\f(r is real) then there exists some C r -small C k+\u03b1 -perturbation Z of X and an\nopen set V \u2282 U containing K such that Z = X outside U and Z = Y on V .\nFurthermore, there exists a constant C = C(f, dim(M ), K, U, r), \u03b40 and \u01eb0\nsuch that if Y is (C * \u03b4 re * \u01eb)-C r close to X, \u03b4 < \u03b40 , \u01eb < \u01eb0 then Z is \u01eb-C r close\nto X and support(Z \u2212 X) \u2282 B\u03b4 (K) (= the \u03b4-neighborhood of K).\nAn interesting version of this result is the following corollary:\nLemma 2.7 (The C 1+\u03b1 -Pasting Lemma for Vector Fields). Given \u03b50 > 0\nthere exists \u03b40 > 0 such that if X0 \u2208 X1+\u03b1\nm (M ), K a compact set and Y0 \u2208\n1\nX1+\u03b1\n(M\n)\nis\n\u03b4\n-C\n-close\nto\nX\non\na\nsmall\nneighborhood U of K then there\n0\n0\nm\n(M\n),\nand\nV\nand\nW\nsuch\nthat\nK \u2282 V \u2282 U \u2282 W satisfying\nexist a Z0 \u2208 X1+\u03b1\nm\nZ0 |V = Y0 , Z0 |int(W c ) = X0 and Z0 is \u03b50 -C 1 -close to X0 . Furthermore, if X0\nand Y0 are C \u221e then Z0 is also C \u221e .\n\n2.1\n\nA Weak Pasting Lemma in the Conservative Case\n\nIn this subsection we show a weak version of the pasting lemma for C 2 conservative systems, and then we apply it to the study of dominated splittings for\nconservative systems.\nThe pasting lemma in this case is:\nLemma 2.8. If f is a C 2 -conservative diffeomorphism and x is a point in M ,\nthen for any 0 < \u03b1 < 1, \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b5-C 1 -perturbation g (which is a\nC 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism) of f such that, for some small neighborhoods U \u2283 V of\nx, g|U c = f and g|V = Df (x).\nProof. First consider a perturbation h of f such that h(y) = (1 \u2212 \u03c1(y))(f (x) +\nDf (x)(y \u2212 x)) + \u03c1(y)f (y) (in local charts), where \u03c1 is a bump function such\nthat \u03c1|Br/2 (x) = 1, \u03c1|M\u2212Br (x) = 0, |\u2207\u03c1| \u2264 C/r and |\u22072 \u03c1| \u2264 C/r2 . Denote by\ng(y) = f (x) + Df (x)(y \u2212 x). Now, we note that ||h \u2212 f ||C 1 \u2264 C * ||f ||C 2 * r\nand ||h \u2212 f ||C 2 \u2264 C * ||f ||C 2 , where C is a constant. Then if we denote by\n\u03b8(y) = det Dh(y) the density function of h, by the previous calculation, we\nobtain that \u03b8 is C * ||f ||C 2 * r-C 0 -close to 1 (the density function of f ) and\n||\u03b8 \u2212 1||C 1 \u2264 C * ||f ||C 2 . By the classical property of convexity of the H\u00f6lder\nnorms, we obtain that ||\u03b8 \u2212 1||\u03b1 \u2264 C||f ||C 2 * r1\u2212\u03b1 . So, applying the lemma 2.3,\nwe obtain that there exists a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism \u03c7 which is C * ||f ||C 2 * r1\u2212\u03b1 close to the identity. To conclude the proof is suffucient to note that h \u25e6 \u03c7 is\nconservative and is close to f provided that r is small.\nRemark 2.9. In the last section of this paper, we apply this weak pasting lemma\nto prove that robust transitive conservative diffeomorphism admits a dominated\nsplitting. We hope that this lemma can be applied to obtain some other interesting consequence. In fact, recently, Bochi-Fayad-Pujals were able to show that\nstably ergodic systems are (generically) non-uniformly hyperbolic (see [BFP]).\n\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\nA Weak Pasting Lemma in the Symplectic Case\n\nThe above perturbation lemma can be done for symplectic diffeomorphisms\nwithout the lost of the structure outside the neighboorhood of a periodic orbit,\nas follows. Also we have the same result as in the conservative vector fileds case,\nif we require more differentiability of the diffeomorphism .\nLemma 2.10. If f is a C k -symplectic diffeomorphism (k \u2265 1), x \u2208 P ern (f )\nis a periodic point of f and g is a local diffeomorphism (C k -close to f ) defined\nin a small neighborhood U of the f -orbit of x, then there exists a C k -symplectic\ndiffeomorphism h (C k -close to f ) and some neighborhood U \u2282 V of x satisfying\nh|U = g and g|V c = f\nProof. Consider the f -orbit O(x) of x. Since all the perturbations are local, by\nDarboux's theorem, we can use local coordinates near each point in O(x), say\n\u03c6i : Ui \u2192 Vi , where f i (x) \u2208 Ui and 0 \u2208 Vi = B\u03b3i (0) \u2282 Rn . With respect to\nthis coordinates, we have the local maps f : B\u03b4i (0) \u2192 Vi+1 , where Vn = V1 ,\nB\u03b4i (0) \u2282 Vi are small neighborhoods of 0, f (0) = 0. In the symplectic case,\nwe fix some bump function \u03bb : R \u2192 [0, 1] such that \u03bb(z) = 1 for z \u2264 1/2\nand \u03bb(z) = 0 for z \u2265 1. Let S1,i a generating function for g : B\u03b4i (0) \u2192 Vi+1\nand S0,i a generating function for f : B\u03b4i (0) \u2192 Vi+1 (see [X] for definitions and\nproperties of generating functions). Finally, let S(x, y) = \u03bb( 2||(x,y)||\n)*S1,i (x, y)+\n\u03b4i\n\u0003\n\u0002\n)\n*\nS\n(x,\ny).\nIn\nparticular,\nif\nh\nthe\nsymplectic\nmap\nassociated\n1 \u2212 \u03bb( 2||(x,y)||\n0,i\n\u03b4i\nto S, then h = g in B\u03b4i /4 (0) and g = f outside B\u03b4i /2 (0). To summarize, this\nconstruction give us a symplectic \u01eb-C 1 -perturbation g of f , if the numbers \u03b4i\nare small, such that h coincides with g, near to each point f i (x).\nRemark 2.11. We can not obtain global versions of the pasting lemma for symplectic diffeomorphism, as proved for conservative ones, since we used a local\ntool: generating functions.\n\n3\n\nDenseness Results\n\nWe start this section proving that C \u221e conservative vector fields are C 1 -dense\nin C 1 conservative vector fields:\n1\n1\nTheorem 3.1. X\u221e\nm (M ) is C -dense on Xm (M ).\n\nProof. Locally we proceed as following: take conservative local charts (Moser's\ntheorem) and get \u03b7\u03b5 a C \u221e Friedrich's mollifier. If X = (X1 , . . . , Xn ), we define\nX\u03b5 = (X1 \u2217 \u03b7\u03b5 , . . . Xn \u2217 \u03b7\u03b5 ) a C \u221e vector field. Now we note the dxd i (Xi \u2217 \u03b7\u03b5 ) =\n( dxd i Xi )\u2217 \u03b7\u03b5 , so div X\u03b5 = 0. Furthermore X\u03b5 converges to X in the C 1 -topology.\nNow we get local charts (Ui , \u03c6i ), i = 1, ..., m as above and \u03bei a partition of\nunity subordinated to Ui , and open sets Wi such that Wi \u2282 Vi := supp(\u03bei ) \u2282\nUi satisfies \u03c6i (Wi ) = B(0, 1/3) and \u03c6i (Vi ) = B(0, 2/3), \u03bei |Wi = 1 and \u03a9 :=\nM \\int(Wi ) is a manifold with boundary C \u221e . And we fix C as the constant\ngiven by theorem 2.1\n5\n\n\f\u221e\n1\nIn each of those charts we\nPget Xi a C\u221e conservative vector fields C -close to\nX such that if we take Y = i \u03bei Xi a C vector field and we denote g = div Y\na C \u221e function then:\n\u03b5\n-C 1 -close to 0 (where K is the constant on the above theorem).\n\u2022 g is 2C\nIndeed, we have:\n\ng=\n\nX\n\n\u2207\u03bei * Xi + \u03bei * div Xi =\n\nX\n\n\u2207\u03bei * Xi .\n\ni\n\ni\n\nSo, it's sufficient take the Xi 's C 1 -close enough to X.\n\u2022 Y is 2\u03b5 -C 1 -close to X.\nBy the divergence theorem we get that\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\ndiv Y =\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\nY *N =\u2212\n\nXZ\ni\n\nR\n\n\u03a9\n\ng = 0, since:\n\nXi * N = \u2212\n\u2202Wi\n\nXZ\ni\n\ndiv Xi = 0.\n\nWi\n\nNow we get v the vector field given by theorem 2.1 and we define Z = Y \u2212 v.\nWe observe that Z is a C \u221e vector field because v is C \u221e at the boundary. Also\ndiv Z = 0. Finally since Y is 2\u03b5 -C 1 -close to X and v is 2\u03b5 -C 1 -close to 0 we get\nZ \u03b5-C 1 -close to X. The proof is complete.\nRemark 3.2. As Ali Tahzibi pointed out to the second author after the conclusion of this work, the previous theorem was proved by Zuppa [Zu] (in 1979)\nwith a different proof. In fact, since Dacorogna-Moser's result was not available\nat that time, Zuppa uses that the Laplacian operator admits a right inverse.\nIn the next sections we study some other consequences of the pasting lemmas\nfor conservative systems.\n\n4\n\nRobustly Transitive Conservative Flows in 3manifolds are Anosov\n\nLet M 3 be a compact three manifold and \u03c9 a smooth volume in M . A vector\nfield X \u2208 X1m (M ) is C 1 -robustly transitive (in X1m (M )) if there is \u01eb > 0 such\nthat every Y \u2208 X1m (M ) an \u01eb-C 1 -perturbation of X is transitive.\nIn this section we study conservative flows in 3-dimensional manifolds. e Actually, we have the following theorem by Morales, Pac\u0131\u0301fico and Pujals [MPP]:\nAny isolated singular C 1 robustly transitive set is a proper attractor. This result\nis related with a theorem by C. Doering [D]: A C 1 robustly transitive flow is\nAnosov. In the same spirit of the diffeomorphism case, we can use the pertubation lemma to prove the conservative version of these results.\nMore precisely, we prove that: C 1 robustly transitive conservative C 1 -flows in\nthree-dimensional manifolds are Anosov. With this theorem and using the same\n6\n\n\ftechniques we obtain: If \u039b is an isolated robustly transitive set of a conservative\nvector field X \u2208 X1m (M ) then it cannot have a singularity. Singular robustly\ntransitive flows in 3-manifolds are related with geometrical Lorenz-like sets, so\nour results gives that: There are no conservative Lorenz-like sets. We now state\nthe theorems:\nTheorem A. Let X \u2208 X1m (M ) be a conservative C 1 -robustly transitive vector\nfield in a 3-dimensional compact manifold. Then X is Anosov.\nTheorem B. If \u039b is an isolated robustly transitive set of a conservative vector\nfield X \u2208 X1m (M ) then it cannot have a singularity.\nIn particular, because the geometrical Lorenz sets are robustly transitive\nand carrying singularities [V], as a corollary we have:\nCorollary 4.1. There are no geometrical Lorenz sets in the conservative setting.\n\n4.1\n\nSome Lemmas\n\nAs in the diffeomorphism case we cannot have elliptic periodic orbits (or singularities) in the presence of robust transitivity. More precisely we have the\nfollowing lemmas:\nLemma 4.2. If X \u2208 X1m (M ) is C 1 -robustly transitive then there are no elliptic\nsingularities (i.e. the spectrum of DX(p) does not contain in S 1 ).\nProof. Suppose that there exist an elliptic singularity \u03c3. Then we get K a small\nneighborhood of \u03c3 such that XK is C 1 -close to the linear vector field DX(\u03c3).\nNow, we use the theorem 2.5 to obtain a vector field Y C 1 -close to X with a\n(possibly smaller) invariant neighborhood. This contradicts transitivity.\nWe also have the same result for periodics orbits:\nLemma 4.3. If X \u2208 X1m (M ) is C 1 -robustly transitive then every periodic orbit\nis hyperbolic.\nProof. Suppose that there exist an elliptic periodic orbit p. Then we get K a\nsmall neighborhood of O(p) (e.g., a tubular neighborhood) such that the linear\nflow induced by the periodic orbit restricted to K is C 1 -close to X. Now, we use\nthe theorem 2.5 to obtain a vector field Y C 1 -close to X with a (possibly smaller)\ninvariant neighborhood (an invariant torus). This contradicts transitivity.\nRemark 4.4. The above corollaries holds for robustly transitive sets instead for\nthe whole manifold with only minor modifications on the statement.\n\n7\n\n\f4.2\n\nProof of the Theorem A\n\nBy lemma 4.2 there are no elliptic singularities. By an argument of Robinson [R]\nwe can supose that any singularity is hyperbolic. Also by lemma 4.3 every\nperiodic orbit is hyperbolic.\nRemark 4.5. This needs the robust transitivity and the perturbation lemma\nsince Kupka-Smale's theorem is false on dimension three for conservative vector\nfields.\nNow we note that the result below by Doering [D] also holds in the conservative case.\nTheorem 4.6. Let S(M ) = {X \u2208 X1m (M ); every \u03c3 \u2208 Crit(X) is hyperbolic}.\nIf X \u2208 S(M ) then X is Anosov.\nNow if X is robustly transitive then we already know that any critical element is hyperbolic so we have the result.\nWe only sketch the Doering's proof, since is straighforward that it works in\nthe conservative case:\nLemma 4.7. If X \u2208 S(M ) then M \u2212 Sing(X) has dominated splitting. In\nparticular there are no singularities.\nProof. We start with a result on [D, Proposition 3.5]:\nClaim: There exist c > 0 and 0 < \u03bb < 1 and U neighborhood of X in\nS(M ) such that there exist (C, \u03bb)-dominated splitting for any q \u2208 P er(Y ) (for\nthe definition of (C, \u03bb) dominated splitting see [D]).\nLet x a regular point for any Y \u2208 U, so there are Yn such that x \u2208 P er(Yn )\n(Pugh's Closing Lemma). Now we get the P Yn -hyperbolic splitting over OYn (x)\nand by compacity of the Grassmanian we have a splitting over OX (x) (by saturation) then by the Claim we have that this splitting is a (C, \u03bb)-dominated\nsplitting. Now by the abstract lemma of Doering [D, Lemma 3.6] we obtain a\ndominated splitting on M \u2212 Sing(x).\nBy hyperbolicity x0 is an interior point of (M \u2212 Sing(X)) \u222a x0 , but this is\na contradiction with the domination by the abstract [D, Theorem 2.1].\nThe proof finish with the following result that is also available in the conservative setting.\nLemma 4.8 (Liao's theorem). If X \u2208 S(M ) without singularities then X is\nAnosov.\n\n4.3\n\nProof of the Theorem B\n\nWe follow the steps of [MPP]. We denote by U a neighborhood such that every\nY \u2208 U is transitive.\nAs in the proof of the previous theorem, we can supose that any singularity\nor periodic orbit is hyperbolic. The first step is to prove that in fact it is a\nLorenz-like singularity. Recall that a singularity \u03c3 is Lorenz-like if its eigenvalues\n8\n\n\f\u03bb2 (\u03c3) \u2264 \u03bb3 (\u03c3) \u2264 \u03bb1 (\u03c3) satisfies either \u03bb3 (\u03c3) < 0 \u21d2 \u2212\u03bb3 (\u03c3) < \u03bb1 (\u03c3) or \u03bb3 (\u03c3) >\n0 \u21d2 \u2212\u03bb3 (\u03c3) > \u03bb2 (\u03c3).\nLemma 4.9. If X \u2208 X1m (M ) is C 1 -robustly transitive vector field then any\nsingularity \u03c3 is Lorenz-like.\nProof. First of all, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 are real. Indeed, if \u03c9 = a + ib is an\neigenvalue of \u03c3, then the others are a \u2212 ib and \u22122a. Since the singularity is\nhyperbolic, we can suppose also that X \u2208 X\u221e\nm (M ) (using theorem 3.1). By\nconnecting lemma [WX], we can assume that there exist a loop \u0393 associated to\n\u03c3 which is a Shilnikov Bifurcation. Then by [BS, page 338] there is a vector\nfield C 1 -close to X with an elliptic singularity which gives a contradiction (We\nobserve that the regularity for the bifurcation in [BS] is more than or equal to\nseven).\nLet \u03bb2 (\u03c3) \u2264 \u03bb3 (\u03c3) \u2264 \u03bb1 (\u03c3) the eigenvalues. Now, \u03bb2 (\u03c3) < 0 and \u03bb1 (\u03c3) > 0,\nbecause\nP it is hyperbolic and there are no source or sink (div X = 0). Also, using\nthat\n\u03bbi = 0 we have that:\n\u2022 \u03bb3 (\u03c3) < 0 \u21d2 \u2212\u03bb3 (\u03c3) < \u03bb1 (\u03c3),\n\n\u2022 \u03bb3 (\u03c3) > 0 \u21d2 \u2212\u03bb3 (\u03c3) > \u03bb2 (\u03c3).\n\nNow we give a sufficient condition which guarantees that \u039b is the whole\nmanifold.\nTheorem 4.10. If \u039b is a transitive isolated set of a conservative vector field X,\nsuch that every x \u2208 CritX (\u039b) is hyperbolic and contains robustly the unstable\nmanifold of a critical element then \u039b = M .\nProof. We will use the following abstract lemma, which can be found in [MPP]:\nLemma 4.11 (2.7 of [MPP]). If \u039b is an isolated set of X with U an isolating\nblock and a neighborhood W of \u039b such that Xt (W ) \u2282 U for every t \u2265 0 then \u039b\nis an attracting set of X.\nWe will prove that the hypothesis of the previous lemma are satisfied. This\nwill imply that \u039b = M since there are no attractors for conservative systems.\nIf there are no such W , then there exists xn \u2192 x \u2208 \u039b and tn > 0 such that\nXtn \u2208 M \u2212 U and Xtn \u2192 q \u2208 M \u2212 U . Now, get V \u2282 O \u2282 int(U ) \u2282 U a\nneighborhood of \u039b. We have q \u2208\n/ V.\nThere exist a neighborhood U0 \u2282 U of X such that \u039bY (U ) \u2282 V for every\nY \u2208 U0 . And by hypothesis we have WYu (x0 (Y )) \u2282 V .\nu\nIf x \u2208\n/ Crit(X), then let z such that \u039b = \u03c9X (z), p \u2208 WX\n(x0 ) \u2212 OX (x0 ), so\n\u2032\np \u2208 \u039b. Now we have zn \u2208 OX (z), tn > 0 such that zn \u2192 p and Xt\u2032n (xn ) \u2192 x.\nNow, by connecting lemma [WX] there exist a Z \u2208 U0 such that q \u2208 WZu (x0 (Z))\nand q \u2208\n/ V this contradicts the non existence of W .\nIf x \u2208 Crit(X) we can use the Hartman-Grobman theorem to find x\u2032n in\nu\nthe positive orbit of xn ,r \u2208 (WX\n(x) \u2212 OX (x)) \u2212 Crit(X) and t\u2032n > 0 such\n9\n\n\fthat x\u2032n \u2192 r and Xt\u2032n (x\u2032n ) \u2192 q. This is a reduction to the first case since the\nfollowing lemma says that r \u2208 \u039b (the proof of the lemma below is the same as\nin conservative case, since it only use connecting lemma and \u03bb-lemma):\nLemma 4.12 (2.8 of [MPP]). If \u039b satisfy the hypothesis of the theorem 4.10\nu\nthen WX\n(x) \u2282 \u039b for any x \u2208 CritX (\u039b).\n\nNow we prove that there are no singularities. If \u039b = M then by theorem A\nX will be Anosov, hence whitout singularities. So we can assume that \u039b is\na proper set with a singularity and find a contradiction. Now we follow the\nargument on [MPP].\nu\nSo taking X or \u2212X there exist a singularity \u03c3 such that dim(WX\n(\u03c3)) = 1.\nLet U an isolating block such that \u039bY (U ) is a connected transitive set for any\nY \u2208 U. We will prove that WYu (\u03c3(Y )) \u2282 U for any Y \u2208 U, so by theorem 4.10\nwe have a contradiction.\nSupose that this don't happen for an Y \u2208 U. By the dimensional hypothesis\nu\nwe have two branches w+ and w\u2212 of WX\n(\u03c3) \u2212 {\u03c3}. Let q + \u2208 w+ and q \u2212 \u2208 w\u2212\n\u00b1\n(also q (Y ) the continuation). Because the negative orbit of q \u00b1 (Y ) converge\nto \u03c3(Y ) and the unstable manifold is not containing on U then there exist a\nt > 0 such that or Yt (q + (Y )) or Yt (q \u2212 (Y )) is not in U . We can assume the first\ncase. We know that there exist a neighborhood U \u2032 \u2282 SU of Y such that for any\nZ \u2208 U \u2032 we have Wt (q + (Z)) \u2208\n/ U . Let z \u2208 \u039bY (U ) with dense orbit on \u039bY (U ),\nthis implies that q \u2212 (Y ) \u2208 \u03c9Y (z). So we can find a sequence zn \u2192 q \u2212 (Y ) in\nOY (z) and tn > 0 such that Ytn (zn ) \u2192 q for some q \u2208 WYs (\u03c3(Y )) \u2212 {\u03c3(Y )}. We\nset p = q \u2212 (Y ).\nBy the connecting lemma, there exist a Z \u2208 U \u2032 such that q \u2212 (Z) \u2208 WZu (\u03c3(Z)),\nusing the same arguments on lemma 4.12 we can find a Z \u2032 \u2208 U \u2032 and t\u2032 > 0\nsuch that Zt\u2032\u2032 (q \u2212 (Z \u2032 )) \u2208\n/ U . This shows that \u03c3(Z \u2032 ) is isolated in \u039bZ \u2032 (U ) by\nconnecteness we gain that \u039bZ \u2032 (U ) is trivial. A contradiction.\nUsing the same proof of theorem 6.2 we can obtain the same result for\nconservative vector fields but in dimension greater than 3. So we have that\ngenerically if X has a finite number of homoclinic classes then it is transitive.\nn\nS\nH(pi ) so there are\nIndeed, by Pugh's lemma we obtain M = Sing(X) \u222a\ni=1\n\nno singularities and only one homoclinic class, hence transitive. This result\ncannot be directly strenghted to obtain transitivity of generic conservative flows,\nbecause the connecting lemma of Bonatti, Crovisier [BC] is not available in this\ncase. Furthermore, we believe that far away from elliptic points it can be proved\nthat there is a dominated splitting (the weak Herman's conjecture for flows).\nThis will need a version for flows of the Bonatti-Diaz-Pujals [BDP] theorem.\n\n10\n\n\f5\n\nRobust transitive conservative diffeomorphism\n\nNow we study the existence of a dominated splitting for conservative diffeomorphisms. This is a topic of many researches and several results on the dissipative\ncase are well know and we see that transitive systems plays an important role,\nfor example we have the following result of [BDP]: every C 1 robustly transitive\ndiffeomorphism has a dominated splitting. This theorem is preceding by several\nresults in particular cases :\n\u2022 Ma\u00f1e [Ma]: Every C 1 -robustly transitive diffeomorphism on a compact\nsurface is an Anosov system, i.e. it has a hyperbolic (hence dominated)\nsplitting.\n\u2022 Diaz, Pujals, Ures [DPU]: There is an open, dense set of 3-dimensional\nC 1 -robustly transitive diffeomorphisms admitting dominated splitting.\nWe use the perturbation lemmas to prove the conservative version of the\ntheorem by Bonatti, Diaz and Pujals [BDP] mentioned above:\nTheorem C. Let f be a C 1 -robustly transitive conservative diffeomorphism.\nThen f admits a nontrivial dominated splitting defined on the whole M .\nIn particular, in dimension 2, we extend Ma\u00f1\u00e9's theorem for conservative\nrobustly transitive systems.\nTheorem 5.1. A C 1 -robustly transitive conservative system f \u2208 Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) is\nan Anosov diffeomorphism.\nAs remarked in [BDP], it is sufficient to show that a conservative robustly\ntransitive diffeomorphism f can not have periodic points x \u2208 P ern (f ) whose\nderivative Dx f n is the identity. In fact, this is a consequence of :\nProposition 5.2 (Corollary 0.4 in [BDP]). Let f \u2208 Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) be a conservative transitive diffeomorphism such that there is a neighborhood U \u220b f such\nthat for any g \u2208 U and every x \u2208 P ern (g) a periodic point of g, the matrix\nDx g n has at least one eigenvalue of modulus different from one. Then f admits\na dominated splitting.\nAlso we remark that an immediate corollary of theorem C is :\nCorollary 5.3. Let f be a C 1 -stably ergodic diffeomorphism in Diff 1+\u03b1\n(M ).\n\u03c9\nThen f admits a dominated splitting.\nThis corollary positively answers a question posed by Tahzibi in [T].\n\n5.1\n\nProof of Theorem C\n\nFirst we give some definitions. We denote by P ern (f ) the periodic points of\nf with period n and P er1\u2264n (f ) the set of periodic points of f with period at\nmost n. If p is a hyperbolic saddle of f , the homoclinic class of p, H(p, f ), is\nthe closure of the transverse intersections of the invariant manifolds of p.\nUsing the C 2 pasting lemma 2.8 we have immediately the following:\n11\n\n\fLemma 5.4. If f is a C 2 -conservative diffeomorphism and x \u2208 P ern (f ) is a\nperiodic point of f such that Dx f n is the identity matrix then for any \u01eb > 0,\nthere is a \u01eb-C 1 -perturbation g of f and some neighborhood U of x satisfying\ng n |U = id.\nWe now prove the theorem C:\nProof. If f is robustly transitive then there is some neighborhood U \u220b f such\nthat for any g \u2208 U, g is transitive. In particular, for any g \u2208 U, there are\nnot periodic points x \u2208 P ern (g) such that Dx g n is the identity. Indeed, the\nexistence of such a g \u2208 U would imply, by lemma 5.4, there is a perturbation\ng \u2208 U of g satisfying (\u2217) gen |U = id, where U is a small neighborhood of x.\ne\nHowever, it is easy that (\u2217) is a contradiction with the transitivity of ge. Thus,\nthe proposition 5.2 says f admits a dominated splitting.\n\n6\n\nA conservative version of a result by CarballoMorales-Pac\u0131\u0301fico\n\nIn this section we deal with a well known open question stated by Michael\nHerman in the 1998 ICM [Her]: A conservative system away from elliptic points\nhas a dominated splitting?\nWe deal with a weaker version of this conjecture: Generically a conservative\nsystem far away from elliptic points has a dominated splitting?. In dimension 2,\nthis question has an affirmative answer given by Newhouse [N]: Generically a\nC 1 -conservative diffeomorphism f is Anosov or has a dense set of elliptic points.\nIn higher dimensions, we show a conservative version of some recent results of\nCarballo, Morales and Pac\u0131\u0301fico [CMP] to show this conjecture with an extra hypothesis: Generically a C 2 -conservative diffeomorphism f far away form elliptic\npoints and with a finite number of homoclinic classes has a dominated splitting.\nHowever, we want to stress that Herman's conjecture was recently proved by\nBonatti-Crovisier, thus this corollary is not a main result of this paper. In fact,\nas pointed out by ourselves, their connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits implies\nthe Herman's conjecture in its full version, so our \"corollary\" is nothing but an\nexample of application of the conservative version of [CMP]. For more details,\nsee [BC].\nTheorem 6.1. There is a residual set R \u2282 Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) such that if f \u2208 R is a\ndiffeomorphism with finitely many homoclinic classes and there is a neighborhood\nU \u220b f in Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) such that for any g \u2208 U and every x \u2208 P ern (g) a periodic\npoint of g, the matrix Dx g n has at least one eigenvalue of modulus different from\none, then f admits a dominated splitting and it is a transitive diffeomorphism.\n\n12\n\n\f6.1\n\nProof of theorem 6.1 and a conservative version of\nCarballo-Morales-Pacifico\n\nIn this subsection, we prove that different homoclinic classes for generic diffeomorphisms on Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) are disjoint. We follow the methods used by [CMP],\nwhere they prove the same result for generic diffeomorphisms on Diff 1\u03c9 (M ).\nThe main result of this section is:\nTheorem 6.2. For a residual subset F of Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) (conservative or symplectic, dim(M ) \u2265 3), the homoclinic classes of f \u2208 F are maximal transitive sets\nof f , therefore different homoclinic classes of f are disjoint.\nWe call a compact subset \u039b+ \u2282 M a Lyapunov stable set for f if every open\nneighborhood U \u2283 \u039b+ , there exists an smaller neighborhood V \u2283 \u039b+ such that\nf n (V ) \u2282 U for all n \u2265 0. We say that \u039b\u2212 is a Lyapunov unstable set if it is a\nLyapunov stable set for f \u22121 . We call \u039b a neutral set if \u039b = \u039b+ \u2229 \u039b\u2212 for some\nLyapunov stable set \u039b+ and Lyapunov unstable set \u039b\u2212 .\nWe will use the following lemma, which can be found in [CMP] (lemma 2.2)\nLemma 6.3. If \u039b is neutral for f , then \u039b is f -transitive if and only if \u039b is a\nmaximal transitive set for f . In particular, distinct transitive neutral sets are\ndisjoint.\nFollowing [CMP] we want to prove:\nTheorem 6.4. There exists a residual set R of Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) where every homoclinic class of any f \u2208 R is a neutral set.\nThis together the lemma 6.3 finish the proof of the theorem 6.2.\nWe follow the steps of [CMP]. For this we need two propositions:\nProposition 6.5. There exists a residual set R1 \u2208 Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) where every f \u2208\nR1 and p \u2208 P er(f ), W u (p) (resp. W s (p)) is a Lyapunov stable set of f (resp.\nf \u22121 ).\nProposition 6.6. There exists a residual set R2 \u2208 Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) where every f \u2208\nR2 satisfies Hf (p) = W u (p) \u2229 W s (p), for all p \u2208 P er(f ).\nThe proof of Theorem 6.4 follows by taken R = R1 \u2229 R2 which is also a\nresidual set.\nWe will need the connecting lemma which can be found in [WX].\nLemma 6.7. Let x a non periodic point of f . For any C\u03c91 neighborhood U of\nf , there are \u03c1 > 1,\nL \u2208 N and \u03b50 > 0 such that for any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b50 and any two\nSL\npoints q, t \u2208\n/ \u2206 = n=1 f \u2212n (B(x, \u03b4)), if exists integers m1 > 0 and m2 < 0 such\nthat f m1 (q) and f m2 (t) are inside of B(x, \u03b4/\u03c1) then there exists g \u2208 U such that\ng = f on \u2206c and t is on the positive g-orbit of q.\nWe will fix some notations. We denote Pc (M ) the space of all compact\nsubsets of M with the Hausdorff Topology. Also we denote by K the set of all\n13\n\n\ff \u2208 Diff 1\u03c9 (M ) which are Kupka-Smale. This set is a generic set by a theorem\nof Robinson [R].\n1. Proof of Lemma 6.5\nFirst we prove the local version of the lemma 6.5. Then, it follows from the\nsame methods used on the proof of lemma 3.5 of [CMP].\nLemma 6.8. Let f \u2208 K and n \u2264 0, then there exists a neighborhood U(f, n) \u2208\nDiff 1\u03c9 (M ) of f and a residual set R(f, n) \u2282 U(f, n) such that for every g \u2208\nR(f, n), any g-periodic point p of period m \u2264 n the set W u (p) (resp. W s (p)) is\nLyapunov stable for g (resp. g \u22121 ).\nProof. The proof has the same lines of Lemma 5.1 from [CMP], so we sketched\nthe proof. If U(f, n) is small, by hyperbolicity we have that P er1\u2264n (g) =\n{p1 (g), ..., pk (g)} for any g \u2208 U(f, n). For i = 1, ..k we set the function \u03a8i :\nU(f, n) \u2192 Pc (M ) by:\n\u03a8i (g) = Wgu (pi (g)).\nThis map is lower semi-continuous on the Hausdorff topology. Then is continuous on a residual set Ri \u2208 U(f, n), define R = K \u2229 (\u2229i Ri ).\nNow, get g \u2208 R and p = pi (g) \u2208 P erm (g), then we claim that\u03a8i (g) is\nLyapunov stable for g.\nIf not, by definition there exists an open set U \u2283 \u03a8i (g), x \u2208 \u03a8i (g) and\n/ U . Now we have two cases, if x\nsequences xi \u2192 x, ni \u2265 0 such that f ni (xi ) \u2208\nis a periodic point or not.\nBy an argument of [CMP, p. 14] is enough show a contradiction in the case\nof x is not a periodic point, in fact if x is a periodic point, using the fact of g is\nKupka-Smale and Hartman-Grobman theorem, we can found another sequences\nx\u2032i \u2192 x\u2032 and n\u2032i \u2265 0 like above, with x\u2032 \u2208 Wgu (x), x\u2032 is not on the orbit of x and\n\u2032\ng ni (x\u2032i ) \u2208\n/ U.\nNow, let's focus on the case of x \u2208\n/ P er(g). Because \u03a8i is continuous on g,\nand Wgu (p) \u2282 U , there is a C\u03c91 -neighborhood V of g inside of U(f, n), such that\nWhu (ph ) \u2282 U , for any h in V , where ph is the continuation of p. Now we use the\nlemma 6.7 for x, g and U giving us \u03c1, L and \u03b50 .\nBy the non-periodicity of x, f \u2212i (x) do not intersect the orbit of p for i =\nSL\n0, .., L, furthermore, there exists an \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 such that \u2206 = n=1 f \u2212n (B(x, \u03b5)) do\nnot intersect the orbit of p, and \u2206 \u2282 U . Now choose an open set S containing\nthe orbit of p such that: S \u2282 U and V \u2229 \u2206 = \u2205 (*).\n/ U . Then\nLet i (large enough) such that xi \u2208 B(x, \u03b5\\\u03c1) and set t = g ni (xi ) \u2208\nexists an m2 < 0 such that f m2 (t) \u2208 B(x, \u03b5\\\u03c1). Now get q \u2208 (W u (p)\\{p}) \u2229 S\nsuch that there exists a m1 > 0 which f m1 (q) \u2208 B(x, \u03b5\\\u03c1) and f \u2212i (q) \u2208 S for\nany i > 0 (therefore by (*) we have f \u2212i (q) \u2208\n/ \u2206 (**)).\nNow we apply the lemma 6.7 and find an h \u2208 V , h equal to g in \u2206c . Then by\n(*), (**), we have ph = p and q \u2208 Whu (p). But the lemma also says that t is in\nthe h-positive orbit of q, then t \u2208 Whu (p) and t \u2208\n/ U , and this is a contradiction\nu\nwith the fact that for a h \u2208 V , we have Wh (ph ) \u2282 U .\n\n14\n\n\fThe proof of proposition 6.5 follows from the lemma above by standard\nmethods (see the proof of lemma 3.5, p. 12 on [CMP]).\n2. Proof of Lemma 6.6\nAgain the proof follows from a local form of the proposition and the methods\nof the proof of lemma 3.5 in [CMP].\nLemma 6.9. Let f \u2208 K and n > 0, there exists a neighborhood V(f, n) of f\nand a residual ser P(f, n) \u2282 V(f, n) such that if g \u2208 P(f, n) and p \u2208 P erm (g)\nwith m \u2264 n then Hg (p) = Wgu (p) \u2229 Wgs (p).\nProof. Let V(f, n) neighborhood of f such that P er1\u2264n (g) = {p1 (g), ..., pk (g)}\non V(f, n), and again let \u03a8i (g) = Hg (pi (g)) for i = 1, ..k, a lower semicontinuous\nfunction, and P i (f, n) the set of points of continuity of \u03a8i on V(f, n) (a residual\nset). Set P = K \u2229 (\u2229i P i (f, n)) \u2229 R (residual) where R1 is the residual set given\nby proposition 6.5.\nLet p = pi (g) \u2208 P erm (g) for some i with m \u2264 n and g \u2208 P(f, n). Suppose\nthat the lemma is false for \u03a8i (g), then there is x \u2208 Wgu (p) \u2229 Wgs (p)\\Hg (p).\nAgain we have two cases, x be a periodic point or not, like in lemma 6.8 we\ncan suppose x a non periodic point. We fix then K a compact neighborhood\nof x such that K \u2229 Hg (p) = \u2205, then by continuity there is U neighborhood of g\nwhere K \u2229 Hh (ph ) = \u2205 for all h \u2208 U.\nLet \u03c1, L and \u03b50 in the lemma 6.7. We found an \u03b5 < \u03b50 such that g i (p) \u2208\n/\nSL\n\u2206 = i=0 f \u2212i B(x, \u03b5) and B(x, \u03b5) \u2282 K. Let V containing the orbit of p and\nV \u2229 \u2206 = \u2205. Again we can find q \u2208 Wgu (p)\\{p} \u2229 V , t \u2208 Wgs (p)\\{p} \u2229 V , m1 > 0\nand m2 < 0 like in lemma 6.7 and also, with g \u2212i (q) \u2208 V and g i (t) \u2208 V for all\ni > 0.\nIf there exists i > 0 with g i (q) = t then q be an homoclinic point of g passing\non K absurd, so there is not such i.\nSo by the lemma 6.7 there exists h \u2208 U equal to g off \u2206 an t is in the future\norbit of q. Like before, we have ph = p, q \u2208 Whu (p) and t \u2208 Whs (p), by a small\nperturbation we can assume that the h-orbit of q is in Hh (ph ). This implies\nK \u2229 Hh (ph ) 6= \u2205, a contradiction.\nNow we prove the theorem 6.1 :\nProof. Using lemma 7.8 of [BDP], we know that non-trivial homoclinic classes\nof periodic hyperbolic points are dense in M , for generic diffeomorphisms f \u2208\nDiff 1\u03c9 (M ). Moreover, the theorem 6 in [BDP] and the assumption that there\nis not periodic point with all its eigenvalues of the derivative equal to one, for\nany diffeomorphism g C 1 -close to f , imply that M is the union of the invariant\ncompact sets \u039bi (g) defined by the closure of the union of the homoclinic classes\nwith a dominated decomposition of index i. But, the theorem 6.2 implies that\nfor generic diffeomorphisms, different homoclinic classes are disjoint. In particular, by the finiteness of homoclinic classes, M is the disjoint union of a finite\nnumber of homoclinic classes (which are invariant compact sets with a dominated splitting). Because M is connected, M is exactly one homoclinic class.\n\n15\n\n\fSince, in our case, homoclinic classes are transitive sets and admit a dominated\nsplitting, f admits a dominated splitting and f is transitive.\n\nReferences\n[Au] T.
