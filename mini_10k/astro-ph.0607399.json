INTRODUCTION\n\nMost astronomers are familiar with Classical Novae,\nexploding stars in which an accreting white dwarf (WD)\nin an interacting binary system accumulates enough material for it to become unstable to hydrogen burning. The\nexpanding blastwave from one such event Nova Aql 2005\nwas recently observed by infrared (IR) interferometry\n(Lane et al. 2005) and the geometric distance was estimated based on velocities from spectral line observations.\nThis result is consistent with the \"optically-thick fireball\" model which has been successfully used for twenty\nyears to explain the time-evolution of the spectral energy\ndistribution of classical novae (Gehrz 1988).\nWhile classical novae are expected to recur, very few\nactually have in recorded history. RS Oph is one of\nthe handful of so-called \"recurrent novae\" with (now)\n6 outbursts since 1898 (Warner 1976). The most recent\noutburst occurred on February 12, 2006 (Narumi et al.\n2006), and this unusual event motivated intense monitoring by the IR interferometry community.\nThe special nature of RS Oph is thought to stem from\ntwo causes. First, the WD is likely extremely close to\n1 monnier@umich.edu: University of Michigan Astronomy Department, 941 Dennison Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1090, USA.\n2 Johns-Hopkins University\n3 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n4 W.

Indeed, detailed models indicate the WD mass is within 1% of exploding as a type\nIa supernova (e.g., Hachisu & Kato 2001). Second, the\nmass-losing companion for RS Oph is a red giant (RG)\nwith a wind, providing a high density medium for accretion onto the WD as well as for the exploding blastwave\nto interact with. Bode & Kahn (1985) have produced\nthe most successful model for recurrent novae, drawing a\nclear analogy to extragalactic supernovae and explaining\nthe radio and X-ray light curves in this context.\nEvans et al. (1988) were the first to study in detail\nthe IR time evolution of a recurrent nova. They monitored closely the 1-3.5 micron flux of RS Oph for about\n3 years after the 1985 eruption. They found the light\ncurve had a characteristic (2-mag) decay time scale of\nabout 30 days, and compared their observations to the\ngeneric predictions of the Bode & Kahn (1985) model.\nThey concluded that their observations could come from\nthe hot, post-shock gas \u2013 this model would predict that\nthe IR source should be seen linearly expanding at a\nrate of about \u223c1 milliarcseconds per day at a distance of\n1.6kpc. This distance estimate is based (most securely)\non the expanding size of the radio emission observed in\n1985 by Hjellming et al. (1986) and Taylor et al. (1989),\nassuming association with the forward shock (new radio data re-confirm the 1985 observations; Rupen et al.\n2006; O'Brien et al. 2006). As will become clear, the distance to RS Oph is key to the interpretation of the IR\ninterferometry data presented here.\nChallenging this interpretation, Hachisu & Kato\n(2001, see also Kato 1991) have recently produced a\ncomprehensive model for recurrent novae meant to\n\n\f2\n\nMonnier et al.\n\nexplain a wide range of the known novae properties,\nand makes a specific prediction for the origin of the\nnear-infrared (NIR) continuum which is very different\nfrom Evans et al. (1988). Following onset of the thermonuclear runaway of the hydrogen shell around the\nWD, the shell expands to AU size, in effect turning\nthe WD back into a red giant. The shell stably burns\nhydrogen for a few weeks, shrinking back to the size\nof white dwarf. According to this model, hot postshock gas plays no role in forming the IR continuum.\nFurthermore, Hachisu & Kato (2001) prefer a much\ncloser distance of 600 pc implying a binary separation\nof 2.9 milliarcseconds, easily detectable with current\ninterferometers.\nIn this Letter, we report first-ever size measurements\nfor RS Oph in the NIR using long-baseline interferometry. Our results are surprising, ruling out the favored\nexpanding fireball model, raising doubts about the established distance to RS Oph, and motivating a new model\nfor the NIR emission.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nIn the Letter we report on data from 3 different interferometers and a summary of observations can be found\nin Table 1. Here we briefly introduce each dataset.\nMost of our data were obtained at the Infrared-Optical\nTelescope Array (IOTA, Traub et al. 2003) which has\nbaselines between 5\u201338m.\nThe IONIC3 combiner\n(Berger et al. 2003) was used to measure 3 visibilities\n(V2 ) and 1 closure phase (CP) simultaneously in the\nbroadband H band filter (\u03bb0 = 1.65\u03bcm, \u2206\u03bb = 0.3\u03bcm).\nData analysis procedures have been documented in recent papers (Monnier et al. 2004, 2006). For the data\nhere, we have adopted a calibration error \u2206V2 = 0.05\n(relative error) on baselines AB and AC and \u2206V2 = 0.10\nfor baseline BC.\nThe Keck Interferometer (KI) was used to observe\nRS Oph on a single night 4 days after the burst (UT\n2006 Feb 16) with a baseline of \u223c85m. Facility and instrument descriptions can be found in recent KI publications (Colavita et al. 2003; Colavita & Wizinowich 2003,\n2000). The K-band (\u03bb0 = 2.18\u03bcm, \u2206\u03bb = 0.3\u03bcm) data\nreported here were the by-product of a nulling observation (being prepared for a separate publication) and\nthe calibration sequence is somewhat modified from the\nstandard procedures; in particular, only one ratio measurement was made per integration.\nLastly, the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) observed RS Oph on 3 nights in 2006 April using the Kband detection system (\u03bb0 = 2.20\u03bcm, \u2206\u03bb = 0.4\u03bcm) with\na \u223c85 m baseline (oriented in NE direction). Detailed\ninstrument and data analysis descriptions for PTI can\nbe found in the literature (Colavita 1999; Colavita et al.\n1999). Because of the inherent faintness of the source in\nApril, coherent integration was used for analysis and a\nlarge calibration error of \u2206V2 =0.10 (absolute, not relative) was added in quadrature with the internal error for\nmodel fitting in this paper.\nWe have split the data into 3 epochs \u2013 from 2006 Feb\n16 to 23 (Days 4-11), from Feb 26 to Mar 13 (Days 1429), and from April 2 to April 18 (Days 49-65). The\nUV-averaged visibility data for each epoch are presented\nin Figure 1 along with some Gaussian profiles for comparison. The IOTA closure phase results are shown in\n\nFigure 2, also split into the three epochs.\nAll V2 and closure phase data are available from the\nauthors; all data products are stored in the FITS-based,\noptical interferometry data exchange format (OI-FITS),\nrecently described in Pauls et al. (2005).\n3. ANALYSIS\n\nInspection of Figure 1 reveals that the visibility curve\nfor RS Oph changes very little between day 4 and\n65 (since the outburst). This is surprising since the\nH band brightness faded by a factor >10 during this\ntime. This result is discordant with the generic prediction of Evans et al. (1988) who interpreted the IR light\ncurve in terms of the time-evolution of post-shock gas at\n105 K moving at the speed of the contact discontinuity,\n1400 km/s (following the earlier work by Bode & Kahn\n1985). This model requires the IR emission to be seen\nexpanding at a rate of \u223c1.0 milliarcseconds per day (assuming a distance of 1.6kpc), an interpretation that is\nnow ruled out.\nBefore discussing alternative models in \u00a74, we wish to\ncarry-out some model fitting to the interferometry data.\nHere we only consider two simple models \u2013 a circularly\nsymmetric Gaussian and a binary star model. For all fits\nand calculation of reduced \u03c72 , we have used the original\ndata points before UV-averaging.\nFirst, we fit a circularly symmetric Gaussian to each\nepoch of data, split by wavelength. Table 2 contains the\nbest-fitting Full-Width at Half-Maxima (FWHM) and\nthe reduced \u03c72 for both the V2 and CP (the model CP\nis always zero for a Gaussian profile). The Gaussian\nmodel is a reasonable fit for the IOTA visibility alone,\nbut clearly cannot fit the non-zero closure phase seen in\nMarch and April. Also, Figure 1 shows that no good\nfit was possible when combining IOTA with Keck and\nPTI data, indicating this model is too simplistic to explain the full range of baselines and/or the wavelengthdependence. Sizes derived from the longer-baseline Kband data are systematically smaller than those derived\nfrom shorter-baseline H-band data (IOTA).\nAs discussed in the Introduction, Hachisu & Kato\n(2001) suggest that the nova's IR light curve might be\ndue primarily to a rapid increase in brightness of the\nWD as it returns, albeit briefly, to a red giant phase.\nMotivated by this work, we realized that the IR emission\nmight be due to the underlying RS Oph binary itself,\nand this might explain the general puzzling features of\nour data: non-expanding emission size, the inadequacies\nof the Gaussian fit, and the non-zero closure phase.\nIn order to test this idea, we fit binary models to the\ndata for each of the three time periods, treating the\nbrightness ratio as independent of wavelength in order\nto fit the H and K band data together. The IOTA, KI,\nand PTI complement each other in Fourier coverage and\nan exhaustive grid search of separations less than 10 mas\nfound unique binary star solutions 13 . Table 2 contains\nthe best-fit binary models for the three time periods, including the reduced \u03c72 (V2 , CP). All three epochs are\nreasonably fit by a similar binary model. The only parameter that changed significantly between the epochs\n13 Our limited (u,v) coverage admit some unlikely additional\nsolutions with larger binary separations which will be discussed\nfully in a future modeling paper.\n\n\fRS Oph Interferometry\nwas the brightness ratio. The closure phase predictions\nfor the binary models are plotted along with the closure phase data in Figure 2. We note that our uv-plane\nis missing coverage in the NW direction and thus elongated structure in this direction would be observed foreshortened.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nBecause the expanding fireball model fails to explain\nthe nearly static size scale of the IR emission, we now seek\nsuitable alternative emission mechanisms for the timevariable IR emission from the recurrent nova RS Oph.\nWe have pursued the reborn red giant (thermonuclear\nrunaway) model of Hachisu & Kato (2001) and found\nthat indeed our 3-interferometer combined dataset can\nbe explained by a simple binary model with separation\nof \u223c3.2 milliarcsecond, PA 30\u25e6 E of N, and a brightness ratio varying from 2.5:1 to 5:1. Next we subject the\nbinary hypothesis to further scrutiny.\n4.1. Binary Interpretation of Near-Interferometry Data\n\nBased on single-line radial velocity data, Fekel et al.\n(2000) finds the RS Oph binary orbit to be roughly circular with a period of 455.72\u00b10.83 days and mass function f = 0.221 \u00b1 0.038 M\u2299 . RGs in symbiotic systems\nare typically 1-3 M\u2299 (Dobrzycka & Kenyon 1994) and we\nexpect recurrent novae to contain a Chandrasekhar mass\nWD (1.4 M\u2299 ); these facts combined with the known mass\nfunction rule out RG masses greater than 2 M\u2299 . Assuming the RS Oph system mass to be 2.4-3.4 M\u2299 , we find\nthe component separation to be 1.55-1.74 AU, or (unprojected) 2.59-2.90 mas at the 600pc distance preferred by\nHachisu & Kato (2001) \u2013 only slightly smaller than our\nobserved separation of 3.2 mas.\nSince the RS Oph outburst took place only 1 month\nbefore maximum redshifted velocity (Fekel et al. 2000),\nour measured binary parameters represent the true orbital semi-major axis and orbital \u03a9 for RS Oph with\nonly weak sin(i) dependencies. Thus, a small reduction\nin the distance estimate (540 pc) brings the interferometer binary model in agreement with expectations from\nKepler's laws.\nThe binary model fits (Table 2) show evidence for a\nchange in the brightness ratio over time. While the\nHachisu & Kato (2001) theory predicts a time-changing\nbrightness ratio, it is beyond the scope of this paper to\ntest the compatibility with the observed IR light curves\ndue to complications from the role of the irradiated RG\nphotosphere and the presence of a post-outburst WD accretion disk.\n4.2. Circumbinary Reservoir of Hot Gas\n< 540 pc derived in the last\nThe distance estimate of \u223c\nsection stands in strong contrast to estimates more\ncommonly adopted in the literature. The most significant constraints on distance are set by resolved\nradio observations of the previous and current burst\n(Hjellming et al. 1986; Taylor et al. 1989; Rupen et al.\n2006; O'Brien et al. 2006). By assuming that observed\nradio proper motions (on the sky) can be ascribed to\nthe fast-moving ejecta or forward shock, workers consistently derive a distance of \u223c1600 pc. Similarly large distances were found considering interstellar UV absorption\n\n3\n\nlines (Snijders 1987) and HI absorption measurements\n(Hjellming et al. 1986).\nGiven the strength of the evidence, we now consider the\nimplications of the d = 1600 pc distance. This distance\nwould rule out the binary interpretation of the near-IR\ninterferometry data laid out in \u00a74.1, given existing binary constraints. Instead, we hypothesize that the IR\nemission arises from a quasi-stationary14 hot gas reservoir that contributes a combination of emission lines and\nfree-free/bound-free emission in the NIR bands. The observed FWHM of \u223c3 mas is \u223c5 AU at 1600 pc, about\n3\u00d7 the expected RS Oph binary separation. This size is\nreasonable for a circumbinary disk or reservoir of hot gas,\nperhaps kept ionized by the outward moving blastwave\nor soft X-ray luminosity from the WD itself following\noutburst. This gas reservoir might be analogous to the\n\"fallback disk\" inferred to form after some supernovae\n(e.g., Wang et al. 2006).\nClearly, the hypothesized gas reservoir must be elongated and somewhat off-center with respect to the central source in order to fit the combined IOTA, KI, and\nPTI interferometry data, especially the non-zero closure\nphases. It is beyond the scope of this Letter to investigate the details here, and we defer development of this\nmodel to a future paper.\n4.3. Future Work\nWhile we have ruled out the important class of expanding fireball models for explaining the IR emission\nfrom the recurrent nova RS Oph, more work lies ahead\nto test the other emission mechanisms discussed in this\nLetter. A future study will attempt to synthesize a selfconsistent model that can explain the time evolution of\nthe IR spectrum, NIR and mid-IR interferometer data,\nand multi-wavelength light curves at the same time15 .\n< 540 pc is confirmed, we have\nIf the close distance d\u223c\na spectacular opportunity to study in detail a likely\nSNIa progenitor and to learn about unexpected shock\nphysics controlling the non-thermal radio emission. Alternatively, the further distance d \u223c 1600 pc suggests we\nhave discovered a significant and new component to the\nRS Oph Nova remnant and future work will characterize\nthe hot circumbinary gas reservoir for the first time.\n\nWe thank J.
