INTRODUCTION\n\nAt the end of their lives, stars of approximately solarmass (0.8\u20138 M ) ascend the Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB), the final phase of nuclear burning in the lives of\nthese stars. The AGB is one of the brightest populations\nin the infrared (IR) sky, contributing up to \u223c20\u201330%\nof the IR light for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\n(Boyer et al. 2011). Essentially all AGB stars are variables (Vijh et al. 2009), with periods on the order of\nhundreds of days. This variability is caused by hydrodynamic pulsations traveling through the extended atmosphere of the star. The dramatic changes in stellar radius these shocks produce cause brightness fluctuations\non the scale of \u223c2 mag (e.g. Wood et al. 1999), on time\nscales of hundreds of days (Fraser et al. 2008; Whitelock et al. 2008; Riebel et al. 2010). On much longer\ntime scales (\u223c105 yr), runaway thermonuclear reactions\ndriebel@pha.jhu.edu\n\nin the helium burning shell of an AGB star, called 'thermal pulses,' can cause much more dramatic brightness\nvariations (Schwarzschild & H\u00e4rm 1965; Vassiliadis &\nWood 1993). Thermal pulses cause readjustments in the\nglobal structure of the AGB star, carrying elements synthesized in the nuclear burning regions to the surface.\nThis process, known as the 'Third Dredge Up,' is responsible for the formation of carbon-rich AGB stars (Iben\n1983), as well as bringing more exotic elements such as\nTc to the surface (Uttenthaler & Lebzelter 2010), and\nits precise details remain a topic of current research (e.g.\nKarakas et al. 2010). Towards the end of their evolution,\nAGB stars exhibit extensive rates of mass-loss (Wachter\net al. 2002), driven by the aforementioned hydrodynamic\npulsations and radiation pressure on the resultant dust\ngrains (Winters et al. 2000; Mattsson & H\u00f6fner 2011).\nThis mass-loss, enhanced by elements produced in the\nnuclear-burning regions of the star and dredged to the\nsurface, makes AGB stars one of the primary sources for\n\n\f2\n\nRiebel et al.\n\n\u03b1-elements in the universe, and an important contributor to dust in galaxies. The precise degree to which AGB\nstars contribute dust to the Interstellar Medium (ISM) is\na matter of some dispute however. Specifically, to what\nextent do AGB stars or supernovae (SNe) dominate this\nprocess?\nThe AGB contribution to a galaxy's total dust budget\ncan be computed if the entire population of mass-losing\nAGB stars in the galaxy is identified, and the rate of\ndust production by each star in this sample is known. A\ncomprehensive study of Galactic AGB stars is hampered\nby extinction in the plane of the Milky Way. The Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) offers the ideal combination of\nrelative proximity and low line-of-sight extinction, allowing for detailed studies of galaxy-wide evolved star populations. The LMC's high galactic latitude minimizes\nboth foreground contamination by Milky Way stars and\nreddening due to intervening dust. In addition, the distance to the LMC (\u223c50 kpc) is well determined (e.g.\nNgeow & Kanbur 2008). See Schaefer (2008) for discussion and meta-analysis of this measurement. This is\nclose enough that individual stars can be resolved, yet far\nenough away that the 3-D structure of the LMC can be\nneglected, accurate distances assumed for all stars, and\ntherefore intrinsic brightnesses determined.\nRecent large-scale photometric surveys of the LMC\nsuch as the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey\n(MCPS; Zaritsky et al. 2004), the Two Micron All-Sky\nSurvey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006), and the Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution survey (SAGE;\nMeixner et al. 2006), have allowed the construction of\ncatalogs of the entire AGB population of that galaxy,\nwith multi-band photometry for tens of thousands of\nsources (Blum et al. 2006). The SAGE-Spec followon to the SAGE survey Kemper et al. (2010) has produced spectral classifications for 100 sources in the LMC\n(Woods et al. 2011). The IRSF survey (Kato et al. 2007)\nalso examined the LMC in near-IR (JHKs ) bands.\nThe AKARI mission (Murakami et al. 2007) has also\nbeen used to survey a portion of the LMC (Ita et al.\n2008). While this survey covers a smaller area, the\nunique [11] and [15] \u03bcm bands of the AKARI satellite are\na valuable contribution to the multi-wavelength coverage\nof this important galaxy. The ongoing Vista Magellanic\nClouds Survey (VMC) Cioni et al. (2011) will push three\nmagnitudes deeper than the AKARI survey, and has already been used to develop a spatially resolved star formation history of part of the LMC (Rubele et al. 2011).\nAs a first step towards the direct measurement of massloss rates for the entire LMC AGB sample, (Srinivasan et\nal. 2009, hereafter Paper I) computed infrared excesses\nfrom SAGE data and used these to estimate the total\ndust injection rate. Boyer et al. (2012, in press) have\nperformed a similar analysis for the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC). Matsuura et al. (2009) determined a simple IR color proxy for mass-loss using mass-loss rates\nderived by Groenewegen et al. (2007) and Gruendl et al.\n(2008) through detailed modeling of individual sources,\nand extrapolated a global gas and dust budget for the\nLMC. An alternative to detailed modeling is to compare\nthe observed SEDs of sources to pre-computed models.\nWith this aim, Sargent et al. (2011, hereafter Paper IV)\nand Srinivasan et al. (2011, hereafter Paper V) presented\nthe Grid of RSG and AGB ModelS (GRAMS) for oxygen-\n\nTable 1\nDe-reddening\nCoefficients\nBand\n\nA\u03bb (mag)\n\nU\nB\nV\nI\nJ\nH\nKs\n\n0.5900\n0.5315\n0.4590\n0.2708\n0.1125\n0.0652\n0.0372\n\nNote.\n- Dereddening coefficients\nused in this work for\nnon-SAGE photometry.\nSAGE photometry was not dereddened, as interstellar reddening is negligible at those wavelengths.\n\nrich and carbonaceous dust respectively. In this paper we\napply the GRAMS to the whole population of evolved\nstars in the LMC in order to derive more precise measurements of individual sources and the population wide\nreturn of mass to the galaxy.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nSection 2 of this paper discusses the sources of our observational data (\u00a7 2.1) and our fitting procedure (\u00a7 2.2\n& 2.3). Section 3 displays some specific fits representative of our sample. Section 4 describes the major results\nof our fitting, including the O-rich/C-rich determination\n(\u00a7 4.1), the revealed luminosity function of the evolved\nstellar population of the LMC (\u00a7 4.2), the integrated dust\nmass return to the ISM (\u00a7 4.3 & 4.4), and the development of simple observational proxies for dust mass-loss\nrate (\u00a7 4.5). We review our conclusions in section 5.\n2. DATA AND FITTING PROCEDURES\n2.1. Data\n\nThe original SAGE survey was conducted in two\nepochs, spaced \u223c3 months apart (Meixner et al. 2006).\nThe observations from these epochs have been combined\ninto a single mosaic photometry archive and catalog,\nwhich is deeper and has smaller photometric errors than\nthe individual epochs. Our dataset consists of 33 718\nsources extracted from the SAGE Mosaic Photometry\nArchive. These sources have been matched to optical\ndata from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey\n(MCPS) (Zaritsky et al. 2004), near-infrared photometry\nfrom the 2MASS survey (Skrutskie et al. 2006), and the\nvariability information of the MACHO survey (Alcock et\nal. 1999), allowing us to construct 12 band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the U band to 24 \u03bcm for\nmost of our sources. A 200 matching radius was used for\nall catalog joins. Details of the matching to the MCPS\ncatalog can be found in the SAGE Data Delivery Document1 . The join to the MACHO catalog is discussed\nmore thoroughly in Riebel et al. (2010). All non-SAGE\nphotometry has been de-reddened, with the de-reddened\nflux, F0 , related to the observed photometry, Fobs by\n1\nhttp://data.spitzer.caltech.edu/popular/sage/\n20090922_en\\discretionary{-}{}{}hanced/documents/\nSAGEDataProductsDescription_Sep09.pdf\n\n\f3\nF0 = Fobs \u00d7 10(0.4A\u03bb ) . Our de-reddening coefficients, A\u03bb ,\nare listed in Table 1.\nWhen extracting sources from the SAGE database, our\ninitial AGB classifications follow from Cioni et al. (2006)\nand Blum et al. (2006). A star is classified as an oxygenrich (O-rich) or carbon-rich (C-rich) AGB candidate\nbased on its location on the Ks vs. J \u2212 Ks color magnitude diagram (CMD). The J \u2212 [3.6] color (or, in the absence of a J-band detection, the [3.6] \u2212 [8.0] color) is used\nto select extreme AGB candidates. See \u00a7 2.2 in Riebel et\nal. (2010) for explicit definitions of these color cuts. RSG\ncandidates are selected based on the color-magnitude criteria presented in Boyer et al. (2011). Specifically, RSGs\ncandidates are defined as being brighter than the Tip\nof the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), Ks = 12, and between the lines Ks = \u221213.333(J \u2212 Ks + 0.25) + 24.66\nand Ks = \u221213.333(J \u2212 Ks ) + 24.66. These CMD-based\ndefinitions are illustrated in Figure 1.\nLooking for Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), Gruendl\net al. (2008) published a list of 13 'Extremely Red Objects' that they spectroscopically identified as carbon\nstars, based on the presence of SiC absorption. Twelve\nof these sources lie outside our defined CMD cuts and are\ntherefore not included in our initial dataset, but we have\nmanually added them to our list, using the photometry\npublished in that work. All of these sources are classified\nas extreme AGB candidates.\nPaper IV and Paper V present the development of\nGRAMS, a grid of RT models of dusty evolved stars calculated using the 2-D\nDust RT code (Ueta & Meixner\n2003). The dust properties for these models were fixed\nby modeling two O-rich AGB stars (Sargent et al. 2010,\nhereafter Paper II) and one C-rich star in the LMC\n(Srinivasan et al. 2010, hereafter Paper III). GRAMS\nconsists of 68 600 O-rich and 12 243 C-rich models, spanning a large parameter space of stellar photosphere and\ncircumstellar dust shell properties. The output from\nGRAMS consists of spectra as well as synthetic photometry for a large set of narrow- and broadband filters,\nincluding the ones used in our study. Using these precomputed SEDs, we are able to find the best fit model to\neach source in our sample through a simple brute force\nsearch on an average desktop computer in only 4 hours.\nThis approach may reduce the detailed accuracy of any\nparticular model fit, but will compensate by allowing statistically accurate trends and patterns to be determined\nfor entire stellar populations in computationally reasonable periods of time. Figure 2 shows the entire GRAMS\ngrid on a [8.0] vs. [3.6] \u2212 [8.0] CMD. The O-rich grid\nis shown in the left panel and the C-rich grid is shown\nin the right panel. The gray background is the entire\nextent of the grid, and the highlighted points (blue for\nO-rich, red for C-rich) emphasize the models that have\nbeen matched to sources in our dataset.\n2.2. Variability\n\nThe overwhelming majority of AGB stars are variable\n(Vijh et al. 2009), with complicated, multi-periodic light\ncurves (Fraser et al. 2008). Because our dataset combines\nmulti-epoch observations from different surveys taken on\nuncorrelated dates, the optical, near-IR and mid-IR portions of the observed SEDs for our stars sample different\npoints in the stars' light curves. Accurate phase correction for such complicated light curves for a sample the\n\nsize of ours is not practical, nor possible for the many\nsources which lack variability data from long-term monitoring surveys like MACHO. As a major goal of this\nproject was to demonstrate large-scale radiative transfer\nmodeling, and the fact that many of the sources without\nMACHO data are the extreme AGB candidates which\ndominate the mass-return to the ISM we seek to measure\n(Paper I), we opted to handle the sources' variability in\na statistical manner rather than restrict our sample to\nthose objects for which precise phase-correction could be\ndetermined.\nTo account for variability, we took the SAGE mid-IR\nphotometry as the baseline observations, and inflated the\nerror bars on the flux measurement in the shorter wavelength bands (UBVIJHK) by adding an additional error\nterm representative of the source's variability amplitude\nto the photometric errors. Because the MACHO survey\nused a non-standard filter set (Alcock et al. 1999), we\nfirst transformed the MACHO b-band photometry into\na Johnson V magnitude using the prescription in Alcock\net al. (1999),\nV = 24.114 + 1.00258b \u2212 0.153(b \u2212 r)\nwhere b and r are the MACHO mean b- and r-band magnitudes, respectively. This transformation allowed us to\neasily cast the MACHO variability amplitude (originally\nin magnitude units) as a ratio of the source's flux at minimum brightness to that at maximum brightness. We\nchoose the MACHO b-band because it is typically larger\nin amplitude than the r band, and thus we err on the\nside of caution when modifying our error bars.\nWe modeled the sources as being a constant flux source\nwith a single period sine-wave signal imposed on it. We\nused the b-band mean MACHO magnitude as the average brightness of the source, due to the seven-year baseline of this measurement. The amplitude of the variation\nimposed on this mean was the MACHO b-band amplitude associated with the dominant period of variation,\ntaken from Fraser et al. (2008). It can be shown that the\nRMS average of a sine function imposed on a constant\nflux FV is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03c3var = FV\n1+\u03b1\nwhere \u03b1 is the ratio of the minimum to maximum flux,\ni.e. the MACHO amplitude (measured in magnitudes)\nconverted to flux units. One-half this quantity was added\nin quadrature to the photometric errors of all non-Spitzer\nbands for each source with available MACHO variability\ninformation. The factor of one-half accounts for the fact\nthat the variability amplitude of AGB stars is greater\nwhen measured in the optical (i.e. at the wavelengths\nstudied by MACHO) than in the near-IR (see, eg. Reid\n& Goldston 2002). For those sources in the SAGE catalog without MACHO observations, a \"canonical\" variability amplitude was constructed from the sources which\ndid. All sources were classified as O-rich, C-rich, or extreme AGB candidates, using the photometric criteria\ndescribed in \u00a7 2.1. The median amplitude of each class\nwas then assigned to all stars of that class without MACHO data, and we inflated the error bars of the nonSAGE photometry in the same manner discussed above.\nThat is, the median variability error term of all MACHOdetected sources classed as O-rich AGB candidates was\n\n\f4\n\nRiebel et al.\n\nFigure 1. Ks vs. J \u2212 Ks CMD illustrating the two classification schemes used in this paper. Color-magnitude cuts (see \u00a7 2.2, Riebel et\nal. 2010, for details) are first used to select AGB and RSG candidates (left panel). The observed SEDs of these candidates are then fit with\nGRAMS models, which point to either oxygen-rich or carbonaceous dust chemistry (right panel). As the GRAMS chemical classification\ndoes not distinguish between O-rich AGB stars and RSGs, we use the CMD cuts of Boyer et al. (2011) (thick lines in both panels) to\nidentify RSG candidates. Sources with O-rich dust (blue dots) that fall within the CMD cuts are classified as RSGs.\n\nFigure 2. [8.0] vs. [3.6] \u2212 [8.0] CMD of the entire GRAMS model\ngrid. Left panel: Every model of the O-rich GRAMS grid (light\ngray) with models selected as a best-fit to one of our sources highlighted in blue. Right panel: Same plot for the C-rich GRAMS\ngrid, with used models highlighted in red. The two grids were designed to span a larger area of parameter space than real stars are\nexpected to cover. This plots shows that best-fit models are clustered in both grids and that the grids cover more CMD space than\nnecessary.\n\nused as the \"canonical\" variability error term for all Orich AGB candidates without MACHO detections, and\nsimilarly for C-rich and extreme AGB candidates. RSGs\nare not typically as variable as AGB stars, and we do not\ninflate the errors of RSGs candidates.\n2.3. Fitting Procedure\nThe best-fit GRAMS model for each of our 33 718 candidate AGB and RSG stars was found using a brute-force\nminimum \u03c72 search. Each source was compared to all of\nthe \u223c68 000 O-rich GRAMS models, and the \u223c12 000 Crich GRAMS models. The best-fit model was defined to\nbe the model with the smallest value of the quantity\n\n\u03c72 =\n\n1 X (fobsi \u2212 fmi )2\nN i\n\u03c3i2\n\nwhere fobsi and fmi are the observed and model flux in\nthe ith band, respectively. N is the number of bands\nfor which a source has valid photometry, and \u03c3i is the\nquadrature sum of the photometric extraction error and\nthe variability error term described in \u00a7 2.2. This quantity is thus properly a \u03c72 per data point. For the reddest sources, defined as those having a J/I flux ratio of\n10 or higher (equivalent to (I \u2212 J) > 1.4), we obtained\nbetter results by neglecting their optical (UBVI) photometry entirely, which represents a negligible fraction\nof the energy of their SEDs. The J/I flux ratio was selected because this bridges the gap between the MCPS\nand 2MASS surveys, and is thus sensitive to both sources\nwhich are intrinsically very red and variable sources observed by the two surveys at very different points in their\nlight curve. A star is classified as O- or C-rich based\non whether the best fitting model is from the O- or Crich grid. RSGs are not a separate classification within\nGRAMS, but the O-rich grid is designed to cover stars of\nhigher luminosities than the classical AGB limit, including RSGs. When RSGs are discussed in this work, their\nclassification as such is purely based on the CMD criteria\nof Boyer et al. (2011) (illustrated in Figure 1). Figure 3\nshows the distributions of the \u03c72 values for model fits of\nboth types. The median of the O-rich chi-squared distribution is much lower than that of the C-rich one. The\ndifferences in these distributions are taken into account\nwhen we address the reliability of classifications made\nby comparing the chi-squared values of the C-rich and\nO-rich best fit models to a given source (see \u00a7 4.1).\nFigure 4 shows two typical fits to our data. These\nfits are 'typical' in that they were specifically selected to\nhave values of \u03c72 closest to the median value for their\nclass (O- or C-rich). The left column shows the SED of\nthe median O-rich fit above its location in the Ks vs. J\n\u2212 Ks CMD. The right column shows the same plots for\nthe prototypical C-rich fit. Both of these sources are\ncentrally located in their respective populations in the\nIR CMD (see Figure 1). The effects of inflating the nonSAGE photometric error bars to account for variability\ncan clearly be seen in the U- and B-band fluxes in the\n\n\f5\nTable 2\nDataset Populations\n\nO-richa\nC-rich AGB\nExtreme AGB\nRed Supergiant\n\nClass (CMD)\n\nClass (GRAMS)\n\n19 566\n6709\n1340\n5876\n\n26 210\n7281\nN/A\nN/A\n\nNote. - Numbers of sources classified as each type\n(O-rich, C-rich, Extreme AGB, and RSG) using both\ncolor-magnitude cuts (see Riebel et al. 2010, for details)\nand using the GRAMS model grid. GRAMS classifications are based on the class of the single best-fitting\nmodel, as defined by the smallest value of \u03c72 .\na The GRAMS O-rich classification includes RSGs, as\nwell as AGB stars\n\nFigure 3. Distribution of the \u03c72 per data point for the best-fit\nmodel to each source in both the O-rich (blue) and C-rich (red)\npopulations in our sample. Both distributions are sharply peaked,\nwith long tails extending to large values. The C-rich sample in\ngeneral has larger values of \u03c72 for the best-fit models.\n\nC-rich SED, right column.\nAfter this initial fitting, we visually inspected the SEDs\nof several hundred sources. The distribution of \u03c72 for\nboth the O-rich and the C-rich samples were found to\nbe sharply peaked (Figure 3), and we selected the 5% of\nthe sample with the largest value of \u03c72 for inspection.\nFor these stars we visually inspected the fit derived using all valid photometry and the fit to the IR (2MASS\nand SAGE) data only. If the IR fit was significantly better (both quantitatively as defined by the value of \u03c72\nand qualitatively as defined by eye) the source was manually flagged to be fit using only the IR bands. Based\non both manual identification and color criteria (J/I flux\nratio), 6089 of our sources were fit using IR data only.\nWe flagged 227 sources as invalid fits.\nThe discarded sources included those with too few valid\ndata points (\u2264 4 bands), obvious foreground sources, and\nsources with SEDs not consistent with an AGB star. Figure 5 displays some example sources with fits that were\nmanually adjusted or rejected. At top left we show a\nsource with an anomalously dim I-band flux. There were\n202 such sources in our dataset. Because the fit based\nonly on the IR data points (red curve) matches the overall SED much better than that based on all the photometry including the I-band (green curve), these sources\nwere retained in our dataset, using the fit based only\non the IR data. At the top right of Figure 5, we have\na source which is obviously a foreground source, misidentified in our catalog as belonging to the LMC. The\nbest fitting model (blue curve) has fluxes \u223c10 times dimmer than the observed object, yet a luminosity of a million L . If this source were truly in the LMC, it would\nbe unphysically luminous. At the bottom right, we see a\nsource with poor data quality. Such bright 2MASS photometry compared to such dim [3.6] and [4.5] \u03bcm photometry is probably the result of a mismatch in the join\nbetween the 2MASS and SAGE catalogs. Such sources\nwere removed from our sample. Finally, at the bottom\nleft of Figure 5, we see a source with an SED not typical\nof an AGB star or RSG. The anomalous optical photometry indicates that this source is either a mismatch\nbetween catalogs, or not an evolved star.\n\nWe are left with a dataset of 33 491 sources matched\nto GRAMS models from which we obtain astrophysical\nparameters such as dust mass-loss rate (\u1e40d ), luminosity,\nand effective temperature (Teff ). Table 2 summarizes\nthese numbers. Our entire 33 491 source catalog is available online as a machine readable table. Table 3 presents\na small excerpt as a guide to the structure of the electronic table. For each source, we list the SAGE mosaic\nphotometry ID, the classification assigned to the source\nusing the CMD criteria of Cioni et al. (2006), the classification assigned by GRAMS, the \u03c72 of the best-fitting\nmodel, the \u1e40d , the luminosity, the Teff and the optical\ndepth (\u03c4 ) of the circumstellar dust shell (determined at\n10 \u03bcm if a star is classified O-rich, 11.3 \u03bcm if C-rich)\nof that model, along with the associated uncertainties.\nMACHO variability data (amplitude and period) are included for sources for which it is available, along with the\nUBVIJHK, [3.6], [4.5], [5.8], [8.0], and [24] \u03bcm fluxes (and\nuncertainties) for every source. The UBVIJHK photometry listed in the online table are not dereddened. Photometric uncertainties have not been inflated as described\nin \u00a7 2.2.\nThe single best-fit model to a given source does not\nhave uncertainty in its parameters such as luminosity,\n\u1e40d , and Teff (strictly speaking, \u1e40d is not a parameter of the model, but it is an immediate consequence of\noptical depth, which is). In order to define an uncertainty for these parameters, we use the median absolute\ndeviation (MAD) for each parameter from the 100 best\nfitting models in the same grid (O-rich or C-rich) as the\nuncertainty for that parameter. That is, for any given\nmodel parameter X (\u1e40d , luminosity, etc.), the quantity\n\u03c3X \u2261 Median(|Xi \u2212 Median(Xi )|), where i ranges over\nthe 100 best-fitting models, is calculated and defined as\nthe uncertainty in that parameter. The MAD is a more\nrobust estimate for the spread in parameter values than\nthe standard deviation or a similar statistic, and more\nappropriate for our purposes since it is highly unlikely\nthat all of the output parameters from the best-fitting\n100 models to a given source will be normally distributed.\nNote that in the case of normally distributed errors, the\nMAD is smaller than the standard deviation, specifically\nstddev \u2248 1.5(MAD). For some of the more coarsely sampled parameters, such as Teff , all 100 best-fitting models\nmay have identical values of a given parameter. In these\ncases, the MAD will be 0, and in Table 3 we have set the\nuncertainty to the unambiguous placeholder value \u221299.\n\n\f6\n\nRiebel et al.\n\nFigure 4. Two example fits from the GRAMS grid. These particular sources were selected because the quality of their fit (\u03c72 ) more\nclosely matches the median value of \u03c72 for their respective grid than any other source. That is, they are the most 'typical' fits in our\nsample. Left panel: An O-rich source. Right Panel: A C-rich source. The bottom row shows the location of each source on the Ks vs. J\n\u2212 Ks CMD.\n\nFigure 5. Four sources selected for visual inspection of the fit. Top left: A source with an anomalously dim I-band flux. 202 sources had\nsimilar SEDs. The actual photometry is plotted in black, the best-fit model based on all valid photometry is in green, and the fit to only\nthe IR data (2MASS and Spitzer) is in red. Notice the IR-based fit does a better job of matching all the available photometry because it\nis not skewed by the I-band. This source was kept in our sample, using the fit to only the IR data. Top Right: The unphysical brightness\nof this source indicates it is not at the distance of the LMC. This source was removed from our dataset. Bottom Left: A source with an\nSED inconsistent with an AGB star. The monotonic increase of the flux of this star as one moves to longer wavelengths is not typical of\nAGB stars, which peak in the near-IR. This source was removed from our dataset. Bottom Right: A source with bad data quality. The\nbizarre SED of this star is most likely due to a mismatch between the optical and IR surveys used in this study. This source was removed\nfrom our dataset.\n\n\f7\n\nTable 3\nSource List\nSAGE IDa\nJ050115.85-692040.4\nJ050311.47-691412.3\nJ051227.54-701730.7\nJ060647.79-664812.5\n\nClassb\n\nClassc\n\n(CMD)\n\n(GRAMS)\n\no\no\nx\ns\n\no\nc\nc\no\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u1e40d\n(M\n\n5.56\n17.36\n42.53\n31.52\n\nyr\u22121 )\n\n5.71E-11\n4.22E-11\n4.22E-10\n1.33E-08\n\n(M\n\n\u03c3\n\u1e40d\nyr\u22121 )\n\n1.19E-11\n1.69E-11\n5.69E-11\n9.16E-09\n\nLbol\n\n\u03c3L\n\nAmplitude\n\nPeriod\n\n(L )\n\n(L )\n\n(mag)\n\n(days)\n\n4149\n10000\n5128\n1000000\n\n299\n879\n384\n-99\n\n0.13\n0.08\n1.74\n0.00\n\n783.70\n110.61\n356.63\n0.00\n\n...d\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\nNote. - Source list of dataset used in this study.

O-rich\nd\nsources in blue, C-rich in red. O-rich sources to the left of the\ngreen line at log(\u1e40d ) = \u221211.3 are classified as low-\u1e40d sources\n(\u00a7 4.3) and are consistent with \u1e40d = 0. All of these low-\u1e40d\nsources have \u03c3M \u0307 /\u1e40d > 1 while only 6% of sources with higher\nd\n\nvalues of \u1e40d do.\n\nThe number 100 was settled on after experimentation\nwith various values from 10\u20131000. The number 100 is on\nthe order of 1% of the GRAMS grid for both C-rich and\nO-rich models, and ensures that the majority of sources\nin our sample will have well defined uncertainties (not\n\u221299) for most parameters. Smaller subsets do not sample a large enough region of parameter space, and often\nhave all models in the subsample with identical values for\nmany parameters. Larger subsets sample poorly fitting\nmodels and can cause an unacceptable number of models\nto have \u03c3X /X > 1. Using 100 models to define the uncertainty is a compromise between these two positions, with\nemphasis placed on the uncertainty in \u1e40d . The number\nof sources with valid errors for each parameter are listed\nin Table 4. We see that most sources have well-defined\nuncertainties for \u1e40d and luminosity. The uncertainty in\nTeff is not well-determined from our model grid. This is\nan expected result. As discussed in Paper IV and Paper V, the model photospheres used in generating the\nGRAMS grid do not offer a very fine sampling of effective temperatures. Figure 6 shows the logarithm of the\n\u03c3  \u0307\nratio of the uncertainty in \u1e40d to the \u1e40d itself, log( \u1e40Md )\nd\n\nvs. log(\u1e40d ). O-rich sources with log(\u1e40d ) < \u221211.3 (to\nthe left of the green line in Figure 6) are not thought\nto represent actual physical circumstellar dust shells (see\n\u00a7 4.3 for discussion). Significantly, this value of \u1e40d is also\napproximately where the S/N equals unity. Only 6% of\nsources with log(\u1e40d ) \u2265 \u221211.3 have a signal-to-noise less\nthan 1, while 100% of the low-\u1e40d sources do.\n3. RESULTS: SED FITS AND TYPES OF SOURCES\n\nWe fit GRAMS models to the SEDs of the O-rich stars\n(SSTISAGE1C J052206.92-715017.6 and HV 5715), as\nwell as the C-rich star OGLE LMC LPV 28579. These\nsources were modeled in detail in Paper II and Paper III\nin order to establish the dust properties for the grid. Our\nresults, listed in Table 5, agree to within uncertainties\non almost every model parameter for all three sources.\nThe exception, optical depth, is due to coarseness in the\n\nmodel grid coverage. The fact that our population scale\nfitting procedures can match the output of detailed modeling so well gives us a great amount of confidence in the\noverall accuracy of our results.\nFigures 7 and 8 show the SEDs and model fits to 8\nsources selected to illustrate the range of stellar parameters spanned by our sample. Specifically, we show sources\nwith the maximum and minimum values of both \u1e40d and\nluminosity for each class of source, C-rich and O-rich. In\nboth figures, the right hand column shows an IR CMD\nhighlighting the specific source shown in the left column.\nThe top source in figure 7 was chosen because it has the\nlargest value for \u1e40d in our C-rich sample. Its SED peak\nis shifted far into the IR, peaking redward of 8 \u03bcm. It is\na bright source, but only half as bright as the brightest\nC-rich sources in our sample (see below). This is consistent with Fig 16 (discussed in \u00a7 4.3), where there is no\nclear relationship between \u1e40d and luminosity seen in our\nsample for either C-rich or O-rich sources. This source is\nhighlighted in the [8.0] vs. [3.6] \u2212 [8.0] CMD in the right\npanel. This Spitzer CMD is used because this source is\nso red that it is lacking a valid J or Ks detection, and\ntherefore cannot be shown on the J \u2212 Ks vs. Ks CMD.\nAs one would expect for such a red source with a high\n\u1e40d , this source is classified as an extreme AGB star using the color criteria of Blum et al. (2006). As discussed\nin \u00a7 4.3, these extreme AGB stars dominate the mass return to the ISM in the LMC, accounting for 74% of the\ntotal amount of mass lost, but only 4% of the sample by\nnumber.\nThe source shown in the second row of Figure 7 has\nthe lowest \u1e40d of our sample. It is one of the few stars in\nour sample classified as C-rich by GRAMS that qualify\nas a low-\u1e40d star, defined as having log(\u1e40d ) < \u221211.3\n(\u00a7 4.3). The uncertainty in its \u1e40d (\u00b11.3\u00d710\u221211 M yr\u22121 )\nmakes this source consistent with a bare photosphere and\nzero \u1e40d . The SED of this source peaks in the H band,\nconsistent with a much hotter object (\u223c2500 K) such as\nan actual visible star not surrounded by dust.\nThe third and fourth rows of Figure 7 show sources\nwith the maximum and minimum values (respectively)\nof luminosity for the C-rich grid. Both of these sources\nhave similar near-IR colors and similar low values of \u1e40d .\nFig 8 has the same format as Figure 7, but all the\nsources here are classified as O-rich. Again, the source's\nlocation on an IR CMD is shown in the right column.\nThe top source in Figure 8 has the highest \u1e40d of any\nO-rich source in our sample. Its J \u2212 Ks color is extremely\nred because the SED peak has been shifted all the way\nto \u223c24 \u03bcm by thick circumstellar dust. We see a sharp\ncontrast with the low-\u1e40d source (essentially a bare photosphere) seen in the second row. For the low-\u1e40d source,\nthe SED peaks in the H band.\nThe bottom two rows of Figure 8 are the highest and\nlowest luminosity sources in our O-rich (which includes\nmodels of RSGs) sample. The lowest luminosity source\nshown at the bottom has a very low \u1e40d as well, but the\nbrightest source (1 \u00d7 106 L ) shows quite a high rate of\nluminosity driven mass-loss.\n4.

O-Rich/C-Rich Discrimination\n\nCioni et al. (2006) proposed a photometric means of\ndiscriminating between O- and C-rich AGB stars in the\nKs vs. J \u2212 Ks CMD. The GRAMS grid shows good\nagreement with these color-magnitude cuts, giving us\nconfidence in the grid's ability to reproduce previously\nestablished population-scale classification schema. Table 2 summarizes our agreement with the cuts from Cioni\net al. (2006). Of the 26 210 sources we classify as O-rich,\n95% are classified as either O-rich AGBs using the cuts\nfrom Cioni et al. (2006) or as RSGs using the cuts from\nBoyer et al. (2011). We also obtain a 83% agreement between sources classified as C-rich by the color-magnitude\ncuts of Cioni et al. (2006) and sources we match to Crich models. The extreme AGB star classification does\nnot exist as a separate category in the GRAMS model\ngrid. One of the aims of this project was to provide Oor C-rich classification for these sources, most of which\nare expected to be highly evolved and thus C-rich. Of\nthe 1340 sources classified as extreme based on CMD\ndefinitions, 1299 sources (97%) are matched to a C-rich\nGRAMS model. Figure 9 shows the SEDs of two sources,\nboth classified as extreme AGB stars by CMD criteria.\nThe left column shows a star which is best fit by a C-rich\nmodel, primarily on the strength of its SAGE photometry, and the right column shows a star classified as an\nO-rich source, primarily because of its optical photometry.\nWe find 29 sources (not classified as RSGs via CMD\ncuts) in our sample with luminosities greater than the\nclassical AGB limit, 54 000 L . This luminosity limit is\nbased on the point at which the core mass of an AGB\n\nstar would reach the Chandrasekhar limit, based on the\nluminosity-core mass relation of Paczy\u0144ski (1971). However, the most massive AGB stars can violate this limit\ndue to hot-bottom burning (Bloecker & Schoenberner\n1991), which also tends to prevent a star from becoming C-rich (Boothroyd et al. 1993).\nWe classify a source as O- or C-rich based on the bestfitting GRAMS model. We assign a confidence in this\nclassification by examining the ratio \u03c72best /\u03c72alt , where\nthe two values of \u03c72 are the best fitting models from\neach GRAMS grid. Because the \u03c72 distributions of the\ntwo classes of star peak at different values (Figure 3), we\nuse different criteria to define the confidence intervals for\neach class. For sources classified as O-rich, we consider\nthem to be high confidence if \u03c72O /\u03c72C < 0.1 and low confidence if \u03c72O /\u03c72C \u2265 0.2 (medium confidence is intermediate to these two). For sources classified as C-rich, high\nconfidence is considered to be \u03c72C /\u03c72O < 0.4 and the classification is considered low confidence if \u03c72C /\u03c72O \u2265 0.6.\nTable 6 gives the number of stars in each category. Figure 10 shows a histogram of these ratios for both categories of sources. The vertical lines denote the points\ndividing high, medium and low confidence. The division\npoints were selected to fall where the source density has\nfallen by a factor of approximately 2.\nWe have tested our classification against the spectroscopically verified sources used by Groenewegen et al.\n(2009) and van Loon et al. (1999). All sources were\nmatched to our catalog using a 200 matching radius. Of\nthe 66 C-rich sources used in Groenewegen et al. (2009)\nthat we find in our sample, we correctly classify 60 as Crich. Of 27 C-rich sources in van Loon et al. (1999), we\n\n\f10\n\nRiebel et al.\n\nFigure 7.

These numbers correspond to 91% and 89% agreement, respectively. The\nO-rich sources show similarly good agreement. We find\n40 of the sources that Groenewegen et al. (2009) classify\nas O-rich in our sample, 38 of which we also identify as\nO-rich. Of the O-rich sources identified by van Loon et\nal. (1999), 14 are found in our sample and 10 are identified by GRAMS as O-rich.\nIn addition, we compared our sample to the surveys of\nBlanco et al. (1980) and Blanco & McCarthy (1990). We\nidentify 177 carbon stars from Blanco et al. (1980) in our\nsample, correctly classifying 145 (82%) of them. Of the\n96 O-rich stars from Blanco et al. (1980) identified in our\n\ndataset, GRAMS classified 92 (96%) correctly. Blanco &\nMcCarthy (1990) focused exclusively on C-rich stars, and\nwe find 538 of their sources in our list, with 426 (79%)\nclassified correctly by us.\nWe also compare our sample to the point sources from\nthe SAGE-Spec program (Kemper et al. 2010) classified\nby Woods et al. (2011). We find 87 sources from that\nproject with valid GRAMS model fits in our own data,\nand excellent agreement between the two classifications.\nOf 17 SAGE-Spec RSGs, 100% are matched to GRAMS\nO-rich models, of which the RSG models are a subset. Of\nthe other 70 SAGE-Spec sources, only 3 have conflicting\nGRAMS and SAGE-Spec classifications, a 96% success\n\n\f11\n\nFigure 8.

Two of the 3 sources with conflicting classifications\nare low-confidence as defined earlier in this section (Figure 12, top two panels). The remaining source (SSTISAGEMA J053027.49-690358.3, Figure 12, bottom panel)\nis technically a high confidence source, but examination\nof its SED shows that it is extremely well fit by both\nan O-rich (\u03c72O = 1.5) and a C-rich model (\u03c72C = 5.9).\nThe fits are essentially indistinguishable for this source.\nCombining all the above comparisons, we conclude that\nGRAMS has a greater than 80% accuracy rate when compared to spectroscopic classifications, correctly classifying 786 out of 948 spectroscopically classified stars to\nwhich our results were compared. The sources which are\n\nmisclassified by GRAMS lie very close to the O- and Crich dividing line from Cioni et al. (2006) in the Ks vs.\nJ \u2212 Ks CMD, squarely atop the locus of low-confidence\nclassifications (green points, Figure 10).\nThe 12 spectroscopically confirmed carbon stars from\nGruendl et al. (2008) are all correctly identified as Crich by GRAMS. We find that the current version the\nGRAMS grid does not contain models of sufficient optical\ndepth to reproduce the 24 and 70 \u03bcm photometry given\nin that work, and we therefore use the luminosities and\ndust mass-loss rates derived by those authors. Beyond\nnoting in passing that GRAMS did identify them as Crich, these sources are only included in our dataset for\n\n\f12\n\nRiebel et al.\n\nFigure 9.

In both panels, the blue curve\nshows the best-fitting O-rich model, and the red curve shows the best-fitting C-rich model.

The bottom row shows the location of the C-rich source in the Ks vs. J \u2212 Ks CMD, and the O-rich source in the [8.0] vs. [3.6] \u2212\n[8.0] CMD due to the absence of JHK photometry.\n\ndiscussions of the global dust-mass injection into the ISM\nof the LMC. It should be noted that the mass-loss rates\nobtained by Gruendl et al. (2008) were derived using the\nsame set of optical constants used by Groenewegen et\nal. (2007) which, as discussed in more detail in Paper V,\nyield values of \u1e40d systematically 2-4 times higher than\nthose produced by a GRAMS model of identical optical\ndepth.\nFigure 11 presents a comparison between the CMDbased classification scheme proposed by Cioni et al.\n(2006) and our current results. The top panel of the figure presents the sources we classify as O-rich, with high\nconfidence sources in blue, and low confidence sources in\ngreen. The bottom panel focuses on C-rich sources, using\nred for the high confidence sources and green again for\nlow confidence sources. Both panels show the line defined\nby Cioni et al. (2006) which divides O-rich AGBs from\nC-rich AGBs in their schema. The GRAMS classification\nis in very good agreement with the CMD-based classification. As the line from Cioni et al. (2006) is based on\nonly two bands of photometry, and GRAMS is based on\n12, we interpret this agreement as giving support to the\nCMD classification scheme. The fact that out of the 1337\nsources in this CMD with differing CMD/GRAMS classifications, 1163 (87%) are considered low confidence classifications lends support to our established confidence intervals. Where the GRAMS classification disagrees with\nthat derived from the Cioni et al. (2006) criteria, we give\npreference to the GRAMS classification.\n4.2. Luminosity Functions\nBy covering the spectral region 0.2\u20131000 \u03bcm, the\nGRAMS grid provides accurate determinations of the\nbolometric luminosity of our sources. With this welldetermined bolometric luminosity, we derive an expres-\n\nFigure 10. Plot of the ratio \u03c72best /\u03c72alt for the sources classified\nas O- (top) and C-rich (bottom).

We find a second-order polynomial fits our data well (Figure 13). Also included\nin the figure is the quartic fit proposed by Whitelock\net al. (2006), and the quadratic fit obtained by Kerschbaum et al. (2010). Our fit is of the form BCKs =\na0 + a1 (J \u2212 Ks ) + a2 (J \u2212 Ks )2 and is detailed in Table 7. We overlay the C-rich sample from Gullieuszik et\nal. (2012) as blue points atop our our dataset shown in\nred. We note the remarkable consistency between these\ntwo samples.\nFigure 14 shows the luminosity function (LF) for the\nO-rich (black) and C-rich (red) populations of the LMC.\n\nRSGs are included in the O-rich sample. The maximum luminosity for an AGB star (\u223c54 000 L Paczy\u0144ski\n1971) is indicated with a vertical black line. The 'picket\nfence' effect seen at high luminosities is an artifact of\nincreasingly coarse grid coverage at these high luminosities (see also Figure 2), not a true characteristic of the\nRSG population luminosity function. The brightest Orich source in our sample is a RSG far in excess of the\nmaximum AGB luminosity limit, with a luminosity of\n1 000 000 L . The brightest C-rich AGB star in our sample is 25 700 L , well below the maximum luminosity for\na shell hydrogen/helium burning source.\nThe O-rich distribution is concentrated at a lower luminosity than the C-rich distribution. C-rich sources\nare generally more evolved than O-rich sources, having had time to experience several thermal pulses and\ndredge up sufficient carbon to become C-rich. As luminosity increases with age along the AGB (Vassiliadis\n& Wood 1993, though it should be noted that this is\nnot a monotonic or smooth increase, but more of a\n'two steps forward, one step back' process), C-rich AGB\nstars should be brighter than O-rich AGB stars (see also\nFig 17). However, the O-rich distribution does extend\na tail to far higher luminosities than the C-rich population reaches. The most massive AGB stars ignite the\nbottom of their convective hydrogen envelopes, and this\n'hot-bottom burning' can make them burn brighter than\nthe classical AGB limit (Bloecker & Schoenberner 1991).\nAdditionally, the AGB limit, obviously, does not apply\nto core-helium burning RSGs, which are also included\namongst our O-rich grid. These two populations extend\nthe bright tail of the O-rich LF, while the median of the\nC-rich LF remains brighter than that of the O-rich population.\n\n\f14\n\nRiebel et al.\n\nFigure 13. Bolometric correction for C-rich AGB candidates at\nKs as a function of J \u2212 Ks . The C-rich sample from this work\nis shown in red, and the best-fit second-order polynomial to the\ndata is shown in green. For comparison, the C-rich sources from\nGullieuszik et al. (2012) are shown in as purple points. The fit\nis to all points in the figure. The dotted curve is the 4th order\npolynomial derived in Whitelock et al. (2006). The violet dashed\ncurve is the relation derived by Kerschbaum et al. (2010).\n\nFigure 14. Luminosity functions for the stars in our sample. Orich candidates are in black, C-rich candidates in red. The vertical\nline represents the classical AGB luminosity limit, \u223c54 000 L .\n\nFigure 12. The 3 sources in our sample with different SAGE-Spec\nand GRAMS classifications. Top/Middle Panels: These sources\nare classified by the GRAMS grid as low-confidence O-rich sources,\na differing spectral classification is not surprising. Bottom Panel:\nThis source is technically a high-confidence classification (\u00a7 4.1),\nbut is fit excellently by both an O- and C-rich model. Again, a\nconflict between the spectrum and the RT model is not troubling.\n\nFigure 15 shows the integrated SED of the O- and Crich populations of our sample individually, together with\nthe combined total of our entire dataset. The figure was\nproduced by simply summing the SED from each star's\nassociated best-fit GRAMS model. This simulates the\nexpected observed SED of the evolved stellar population\nof the entire LMC if it were unresolved. We note that the\nO-rich population (and its RSG sub-population) dominate the SED of the entire population at near-IR wave-\n\nlengths around 1 \u03bcm. The lesser number of C-rich stars\nmeans that they do not outshine the O-rich population\n(except by a small amount at mid-IR wavelengths), but\ndo serve to \"wash-out\" the silicate feature at \u223c9 \u03bcm,\nmaking it much less prominent than if the O-rich stars\nwere observed in isolation.\n4.3. Distribution of Dust Mass-Loss Rate Along the\n\nAGB\nOne of the primary motivators for the study of AGB\nstars is their extensive mass loss. The broad picture of\nthis process is understood (see, e.g. Mattsson & H\u00f6fner\n2011): hydrodynamic pulsations in the interiors of AGB\nstars develop, due to the steep density gradients in\nthe extremely extended atmospheres of these stars, into\nshocks which eject the outer layers of the atmosphere.\nWhen this ejected material cools below the dust condensation temperature (\u223c1000 K), dust forms. Due to its\ngreater opacity, this dust is accelerated by the radiation\n\n\f15\n\nFigure 15. Plot of the integrated SED for the entire sample. Red\ncurve: sum of all used GRAMS C-rich model SEDs, blue curve:\nsum of all used GRAMS O-rich SEDs, black curve: sum of red and\nblue curves. This figure constitutes a prediction for the integrated\nSED of the evolved stellar population of unresolved galaxies with\nmetallicity and star formation history similar to that of the LMC.\n\nFigure 16. \u1e40d vs. bolometric luminosity for our sample. O-rich\nsources plotted in blue, C-rich sources in red. The left side of this\nfigure is a scatter plot of all 30 000 sources in our sample. The\ndiscrete nature of the GRAMS grid leads to sources having best-fit\nmodels with identical values of \u1e40d and luminosity, these sources\nare plotted atop one another in this figure. The left panel shows\nno clear trend of \u1e40d with luminosity. The right hand panel of this\nfigure is a histogram of \u1e40d using the same color coding and scale\nas in the scatter plot. The O-rich sources are clearly bi-modal,\nand the minimum in this histogram (log(\u1e40d ) \u2248 \u221211.3) serves as\nthe division between the low-\u1e40d sources and the rest of the O-rich\npopulation.\n\npressure from the star, and drags along the gas to which\nit is collisionally coupled. While it makes up only \u223c1% by\nmass of the material ejected from AGB stars, the dust\ntakes on disproportionate scientific importance, due to\nits role as the driver of mass loss and because it is more\neasily observed in the infrared than the gas. The dust\nmass-loss rate is one of the stellar parameters spanned by\nthe GRAMS model grid, and we have determined the \u1e40d\nfor all \u223c30 000 sources in our sample. Throughout this\nwork, we report only the dust mass-loss rate, not multiplying by a gas to dust ratio, \u03c8. Our reported mass-loss\nrates will thus be about 2 orders of magnitude smaller\nthan values reported by studies which report total (gas\nand dust) mass loss (e.g Groenewegen et al. 2009).\n\nFigure 17. Plot of [3.6] magnitude vs. variability period. Crich candidates in red, O-rich candidates with log(\u1e40d ) < \u221211.3 in\ngreen, all other O-rich sources in blue. The 5 parallel AGB Periodluminosity sequences are visible (see also Figure 2, Riebel et al.\n(2010)). Low-\u1e40d sources, thought to be the least evolved sources,\nare clustered on sequences 3, 4 and D.\n\nFigure 16 presents a plot of \u1e40d vs. bolometric luminosity, with a histogram of \u1e40d presented along the right side\ny-axis. Luminosity and \u1e40d are presented on logarithmic\naxes, the histogram is linear. As both \u1e40d and luminosity\nare outputs of the GRAMS grid, the discrete nature of\nthe grid is visible in this plot, particularly at the high luminosities. The fact that the grid is discrete also results\nin numerous \"collisions,\" where multiple stars are fit with\nmodels with identical values of \u1e40d and luminosity. These\nstars are plotted atop each other in the scatter plot, and\nare not visible as separate points. There is a slight tendency for \u1e40d to increase with increasing luminosity, but\nno quantifiable trend. For a given star, there is expected\nto be a trend of increasing \u1e40d with increasing luminosity during the course of its evolution. Since our sample\nconsists of stars of various initial masses, various states\nof evolution, and various points along the thermal and\nhydrodynamical pulse cycles, this relation is washed out\nby the numerous complicating factors of AGB evolution.\nThe \u1e40d histogram along the y-axis shows that C-rich\nstars are clustered at the high end of the mass-loss range,\nand the O-rich stars are extremely bimodal. We identify a sub-population of O-rich sources based on this bimodality, using \u1e40d greater or less than log(\u1e40d ) = \u221211.3\nas the dividing line. There are 9442 sources in the low\n\u1e40d population and 16 768 in the high \u1e40d group. The\nGRAMS grid was intentionally designed to cover a wider\nrange of stellar and circumstellar shell properties than\nare spanned by actual AGB stars, and while the best\nfit models for these sources do have non-zero mass-loss\nrates, the rates are so low as to be consistent with zero,\nand we do not consider these low mass-loss rates to necessarily be physical.\nWe highlight these low-\u1e40d sources in Figure 17. This\nplot shows the [3.6] magnitude vs. the log(Variability\nPeriod). C-rich candidates are plotted in red, O-rich\nsources with log(\u1e40d ) \u2265 \u221211.3 are in blue, and the low\u1e40d O-rich sources are highlighted in green. Visible in this\nfigure are the 5 parallel AGB pulsation sequences, labeled\n4\u20131 and D from left to right (Figure 1 from Riebel et al.\n2010).

We would expect the least-evolved AGB\nstars to exhibit the lowest rates of mass-loss, and we\nsee that the low-\u1e40d sources defined above cluster at the\nbottom of sequences 3 and 4, giving us confidence that\nthese sources indeed represent the least-evolved sources\nin our sample, consistent with bare photospheres. Indeed, the low-\u1e40d population is clustered almost exclusively on sequences 3 & 4, with almost none on sequences\n2 & 1. There is essentially no such thing as a non-masslosing AGB star on the fundamental-mode sequence. We\nnote, however, that the half of our sample with welldetermined MACHO periods (that appear in Figure 17)\nconstitutes only 20% of the total \u1e40d of our entire sample.\nA full 80% of the total dust injection from evolved stars\ninto the ISM comes from sources too red to have been\ndetected by the MACHO survey, lack quality variability\ninformation, and therefore are not included in this figure.\nIn a future paper, we will present initial constraints on\nthe variability of these sources, using the warm Spitzer\nmission.\nThere is also a population of low-\u1e40d sources on Sequence D. Table 8 summarizes the relative numbers of\neach type of source on sequence D as compared to the\nother sequences in toto. Sequence D has the same \u1e40d\npopulation distribution as Sequences 1\u20134 (\u223c1/3 low-\u1e40d ).\nSequence D is more O-rich than the radial pulsation sequences. The C- to O-rich ratio among the sequence D\nsources is only 24%, compared to 37% in the radially\npulsating sequences. Bootstrap analysis shows that the\ndifference in C- to O-rich ratio between sequence D and\nthe other sequences is not consistent with sequence D\nbeing a randomly drawn subsample of the radially pulsating sequences.\n4.4. The Total Dust Mass Return to the ISM\n\nFigure 18 shows the cumulative mass return to the ISM\nfrom AGB and RSG stars, as a function of \u1e40d (left panel)\nand luminosity (right panel). Both panels show the running total for both C- and O-rich sources separately, and\nfor both combined. The O-rich grid extends to both\nhigher luminosities (because it is intended to cover RSGs)\n\nPopulation\nAll Sources\nC-rich AGBs\nO-rich AGBs\nRSGs\nExtreme AGBs\n\nTotal \u1e40d (\u00d710\u22126 M\n21.1 \u00b1 0.6\n13.64 \u00b1 0.62\n5.5 \u00b1 0.2\n2.0 \u00b1 0.1\n15.7 \u00b1 0.6\n\nyr\u22121 )\n\nPercent of total\n100.0%\n64.6%\n26.0%\n9.4%\n74.2%\n\nNote. - Total of \u1e40d broken down by classification. Column 3 lists\nthe fraction of the total evolved star dust mass injection to the ISM\neach population contributes. Note that the category \"Extreme AGBs\"\nis a subset of O-rich AGB and C-rich AGB (most extremes are C-rich).\n\nand higher values of \u1e40d than the C-rich grid, but the Crich stars contribute greatly to the total dust injection\nto the ISM, accounting for over half the dust production but only 21% of the sample by number. The total\nAGB+RSG dust mass return, (2.1 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10\u22125 M\nyr\u22121 is dominated by a very small fraction of stars. In\nagreement with Paper I and Boyer et al. (2011), we find\nthat the total contribution of dust to the ISM from AGB\nstars is dominated by a very few 'extreme' stars. There\nare 1340 stars in our sample classified as 'extreme' using\nCMD cuts. Of these, 1299 (97%) are classified as C-rich\nby the GRAMS grid. These C-rich 'extreme' stars comprise only 4% of our sample by number, but account for\n75% of the total \u1e40d . The few 'extreme' stars classified as\nO-rich are also heavy mass-losers, making up only 0.1%\nof our sample by number but representing 13% of the\ntotal dust-injection rate. We find a total AGB dust production rate of (1.91 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10\u22125 M yr\u22121 . This is\nquite consistent with the work of Srinivasan et al. (2009).\nTable 9 breaks down our estimates of total \u1e40d for each\nsub-population in our sample. We obtain exactly the\nsame value for the dust injection rate due to RSGs as\nMatsuura et al. (2009), 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 M yr\u22121 . Our results\nindicate that the dust production in the LMC is dominated by C-rich AGBs, but not to the same extent as\nfound by Matsuura et al. (2009).\nOur estimate of the global dust production of the AGB\npopulation in the LMC is a factor of \u223c2 smaller than that\nof Matsuura et al. (2009). This discrepancy may in part\nbe due to the systematically lower dust mass-loss rates\nin GRAMS carbon-star models than in the models used\nin that work (see \u00a7 5.1.2 in Paper V). Additionally, recent work by Matsuura et al. (2011) indicates that SNe\nmay produce substantially more dust than previously estimated, up to \u223c1 M each. If this result is confirmed,\nour downgrade of the dust contribution of AGB stars\nserves to indicate that SNe may be the dominant source\nof dust in the ISM of the LMC. We would like to note,\nhowever, that care should be taken when comparing our\nresults to other studies. For instance, the GRAMS grid is\nconstructed with the assumption of a constant dust shell\nexpansion velocity vexp , which is kept fixed at 10 km s\u22121 .\nThe actual value of vexp for LMC stars is uncertain, and\nit may depend on the luminosity, metallicity and gas:dust\nratio (see, e.g. van Loon 2000). The uncertain value of\nthe expansion velocity translates to an uncertainty in the\nabsolute value of the dust mass-loss rate and, therefore,\nthe global dust injection rate.\n\n\f17\n\nFigure 18.

The\n1\n'residual' column lists the MAD of the residuals\nto the best-fit hyperbola, a measure of the spread\nof the data about the best fit curve.\n\n4.5. Observational Proxies for \u1e40d\n\nBecause of the observational investment necessary to\nobtain 12 bands of photometry for \u1e40d modeling purposes, or precise CO line profiles to trace the gas return\nto the ISM directly, it is desirable to develop simple, easily observable proxies for this astrophysical quantity. We\nfit hyperbolas to \u1e40d as a function of all possible IR colors in our dataset. Not all colors serve as useful proxies\nfor \u1e40d and we present selected fits in table 10. We have\nfit our functions to only the C-rich AGB population in\nour sample, as we find that the O-rich AGB and RSGs\npopulations are very condensed in color space, and do\nnot follow a well-defined empirical relationship. The primary signature of circumstellar dust in O-rich AGB stars\nis the silicate feature at \u223c9 \u03bcm, which is not adequately\nsampled by the IRAC camera aboard Spizter. The [9] \u03bcm\nband provided by the AKARI satellite is uniquely positioned to probe this spectral feature, we hypothesize that\nKs \u2212 [9] would be an excellent proxy for \u1e40d in O-rich\nAGB stars, and intend to investigate this in future work.\nFigure 19 shows the relationship between \u1e40d and two\ncolors (Ks \u2212 [8.0] and [3.6] \u2212 [8.0]), derived from our\n\nsample. We have chosen these colors for easy comparison to other studies, namely Matsuura et al. (2009) and\nGullieuszik et al. (2012). In order to derive the combined\ndust budget for the LMC, Matsuura et al. (2009) used\ntwo-band color proxies for \u1e40d developed by Groenewegen et al. (2007). The left panel of Figure 19 compares\nthe Ks \u2212 [8.0] color proxy used in that work (dashed\nblue line) to the best fit relation to our data (solid green\nline). Our relation is detailed in Table 10. The right\npanel of Figure 19 shows another example of an IR color\nas a proxy for \u1e40d from C-rich AGB stars. Again the solid\ngreen line is the best fit to our data, detailed in Table 10.\nThe blue dashed curve is the proxy used by Matsuura et\nal. (2009), and the dotted blue line is the relation derived\nby Gullieuszik et al. (2012) drawing on the early results\nof the IR VISTA survey of the LMC. Note that the curve\nplotted here has been divided by the gas to dust ratio,\n\u03c8 = 200, used by Gullieuszik et al. (2012), who give their\nresults in terms of total gas+dust mass return. This allows us to compare the mass-loss rates of only dust. The\nmethod used by Gullieuszik et al. (2012) is similar to our\nown, and the agreement between our curve and theirs in\nencouraging (see also Figure 13). The offset between the\ntwo curves is a result of different optical constants used\nto model the opacity of amorphous carbon dust used by\nour two teams. As our dust is more opaque, a given IR\nflux implies less total dust in our models compared to\ntheirs, which corresponds to a lower \u1e40d . There is currently no clear consensus as to which set of dust opacities\nis more correct. See \u00a7 5.1.2 in Paper V (and references\ntherein) for a thorough discussion of this effect.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe present the largest sample of evolved stars subjected to radiative transfer modeling to date. By fitting\n\u223c30 000 stars with \u223c12 bands of photometry each to precomputed radiative transfer models from the GRAMS\nmodel grid of O- and C-rich AGB stars and RSGs,\nwe compute individual bolometric luminosities and dust\nmass-loss rates for the entire evolved star population of\nthe LMC. Our work forms a useful prediction to be tested\nagainst models of stellar population synthesis and stellar\nevolution.\nWe establish that the GRAMS model grid (Paper IV;\n\n\f18\n\nRiebel et al.\n\nFigure 19.

(2009), and the dotted curve is that derived by Gullieuszik et al. (2012) (see text\nfor details).\n\nPaper V) is an important new tool for the study of stellar populations. Capable of generating statistically accurate predictions for difficult-to-observe stellar parameters such as mass-loss rate and luminosity for thousands\nof stars in a reasonable period of time, GRAMS will be\nvaluable for interpreting the infrared observations of future missions (\u00a7 2.3). Through comparison to previously\npublished studies of AGB stars in the LMC, we show\nthat the GRAMS O- and C-rich identifications are over\n80% accurate (\u00a7 4.1).\nWe present a quadratic formula for the Ks band bolometric correction of AGB stars as a function of J \u2212 Ks\ncolor (\u00a7 4.2). Our fit is detailed in Table 7.\nWe characterize the luminosity functions of both Orich and C-rich AGB stars in the LMC. The O-rich stars\nfollow a distribution between Mbol = -3.5 - -5 centered\nat \u223c -4.3 (\u223c3500 L ). Individual C-rich AGB stars tend\nto be brighter, distributed between Mbol = -4 \u2013 -6 Mbol ,\ncentered at -4.7 Mbol (\u223c5500 L ). Despite tending to be\nless luminous on an individual basis, O-rich sources dominate the integrated IR light from the LMC evolved stellar\npopulation, by virtue of their greater numbers (\u00a7 4.2).\nWe find that the AGB stars exhibiting the 'long secondary period' phenomenon, and lying on sequence D are\nsignificantly more O-rich than the stellar population on\nthe other, radially pulsating sequences. We see a qualitative relationship between \u1e40d and pulsation period for\nradially pulsating AGB stars, in that sources with no detectable mass-loss are concentrated on sequences 3 & 4,\nand do not appear at all on sequences 1 & 2 (\u00a7 4.3).\nWe also derive hyperbolic fits to the \u1e40d from C-rich\nAGB stars as a function of various near-IR colors (\u00a7 4.5).\nPresented in Table 10, our fits are derived from a sample\nmuch larger than those used by previous studies.\nWe derive a total dust mass-injection rate for the entire\nRSG+AGB stellar population of (2.13\u00b10.02)\u00d710\u22125 M\nyr\u22121 of the LMC through consistent, direct summation.\nAssuming a gas-to-dust ratio \u03c8 = 500 for O-rich AGB\nstars and RSGs, and a ratio \u03c8 = 200 for C-rich AGB\nstars, this translates to a total mass injection rate into\nthe ISM from RSGs and AGB stars of \u1e40 = 6.5 \u00d7\n10\u22123 M yr\u22121 , with half the mass coming from Carbonrich AGB stars. Dominated by the uncertainty in the\ngas-to-dust ratio, this figure is accurate to a factor of\n\n\u223c2. That is, Carbon stars inject the same amount of\nmass into the ISM as O-rich AGBs, but two and a half\ntimes as much dust.\n6.
