[1] (see also [2]), the renormalization group (RG) improvement of the Heavy\nQuarkonium spectrum for the equal mass case was obtained within the potential NRQCD\n(pNRQCD) formalism [3]. This result was compared with the one of Ref. [4] (see also [5, 6])\nobtained within the vNRQCD formalism [7]. Disagreement was found. This disagreement is\npotentially important as it propagates to different observables like, for example, t-t\u0304 production near threshold, where it is claimed [8] that the resummation of logs plays an important\nrole. For instance, the matching coefficient of the electromagnetic current, which is a necessary ingredient in these calculations, is different [9, 6]. Nevertheless, for the known logs at\nnext-to-next-to-leading [10] and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order [11], both calculations\nhappen to agree with each other.\nIn order to try to clarify this issue, we will consider the simplified problem of a Hydrogenlike system coupled to nf light (massless) fermions in QED. We will then obtain the next-tonext-to-leading-log (NNLL) RG scaling of the spectrum of this system. In principle, these\nresults can be applied to muonic Hydrogen. In this case, the electron is replaced by the\nmuon, nf \u2192 1 and the remaining light fermion is the electron (which we will take to be\nmassless for simplicity or, at most, of O(m\u03b12 ), where m is the mass of the muon). In this\nsituation, we will be able to compare, in certain limits, with finite O(m\u03b16 ln2 ) results already\navailable in the literature [12]. Our results will agree with these calculations.\nThe computation will closely follow the procedure of Ref. [1] to which we refer for details.\nHere we will just write the main formulas necessary to set up the notation and the results.\nThe first step is to obtain the RG improved matching coefficients of the NRQED [13]\nLagrangian at one loop and up to O(1/m2) (m is the mass of the massive lepton (the muon\nfor the muonic hydrogen) and the mass of the nucleus is sent to infinity in this paper).\nThe NRQED Lagrangian including light fermions reads at O(1/m2 ) (up to field redefinitions) [13, 14, 15]\nL = Lph + Ll + L\u03bc + Lp + L\u03bcp ,\n(1)\nwhere \u03bc is the Pauli spinor that annihilates the fermion, Np is the Pauli spinor that annihilates the nucleus, iD0 = i\u22020 \u2212 gA0 , iD = i\u2207 + gA,\n1\nLph = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n4\nLl =\n\nX\ni\n\n2 X\ng2 X  \u0304 \u03bc  \u0304\nll g\n \u0304li iDl\n/ i + cll1\nl\n\u03b3\nl\nl\n\u03b3\nl\n+\nc\nl \u0304i \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 li  \u0304lj \u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 lj ,\ni\ni j \u03bc j\n2\n8m2 i,j\n8m2 i,j\n\nD2\nD4\n\u03c3*B\n+ c4 3 + cF g\n2m\n8m\n2m\n)\n\u03c3 * (D \u00d7 E \u2212 E \u00d7 D)\n(D * E \u2212 E * D)\n+ icS g\n\u03bc\n+cD g\n8m2\n8m2\n2 X\ng2 X \u2020  \u0304\n\u03bcl g\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nl\n\u03b3\nl\n+\nc\n\u03bc\u2020 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 \u03bc  \u0304li \u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 li ,\n+c\u03bcl\ni 0 i\n2\n1\n8m2 i\n8m2 i\n\nL\u03bc = \u03bc\n\n\u2020\n\n(\n\niD0 + ck\n\nLp = Np\u2020 iDp0 Np ,\n1\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere iDp0 = i\u22020 + gZA0 and\nds \u2020\ndv\n\u03bc \u03bcNp\u2020 Np + 2 \u03bc\u2020 \u03c3\u03bcNp\u2020 \u03c3Np .\n(6)\n2\nm\nm\nWe have also included the D4 /m3 term above since it will be necessary in the evaluation of the\nspectrum once the power counting is established. Moreover, we will consider that the kinetic\nterm matching coefficients are protected by reparameterization invariance (ck = c4 = 1) [16],\nhowever, we will often keep them explicit for tracking purposes.\nBy definition, NRQED has an ultraviolet cutoff \u03bdNR = {\u03bdp , \u03bds } satisfying mv \u226a \u03bdNR \u226a m.\n\u03bdp is the ultraviolet (UV) cut-off of the relative three-momentum of the heavy fermion and\nantifermion. \u03bds is the UV cut-off of the three-momentum of the photons and light fermions.\nThe derivation of the scale dependence of the matching coefficients with respect the UV\ncutoffs of the theory goes identical to the one in Ref. [1]. In particular the fact that no\ndependence of \u03bdp appears at this order. In principle, the running of cll and c\u03bcl could be\ndeduced from the results of [15, 14] by taking care of the changes of the color structure.\nSince we are only interested in the computation of the spectrum at NNLL accuracy, their\ncontribution will vanish at this order as far as the spectrum is concerned (c\u03bcl\n1 appears in the\n\u03bcl\nequation of cD but the running of c1 is zero at LL accuracy). Therefore, the relevant RG\nequations in our case read\nL\u03bcp =\n\nd\n\u03b1\n\u03bds\ncD = \u2212\nd\u03bds\n\u03c0\n\n8 2 \u03b20 \u03bcl\nc + c1\n3 k\n2\n\n!\n\n(7)\n\nand zero otherwise.\nBy taking the matching conditions at the scale m: ck = cF = cs = cD = 1 and {d} = 0,\nwe can obtain the solution of the RG equations. We only explicitely display those which will\nbe necessary later on (we define z =\nTF = 1)\n\nh\n\n\u03b1(\u03bds )\n\u03b1(m)\n\ni\n\n1\n\u03b20\n\n\u2243 1 \u2212 1/(2\u03c0)\u03b1(\u03bds ) ln( \u03bdms ), \u03b20 = \u2212 43 TF nf with\n\ncF (\u03bds ) = 1 ,\ncS (\u03bds ) = 1 ,\ncD (\u03bds ) = 1 +\n\n16\nln z ,\n3\n\nds (\u03bds ) = 0 ,\ndv (\u03bds ) = 0 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe above results are a necessary step towards the RG improvement of pNRQED with\nthe matter content described above, which we consider in what follows. pNRQCD is defined\nby the cut-off \u03bdpNR = {\u03bdp , \u03bdus }, where \u03bdp is the cut-off of the relative three-momentum of the\nheavy fermions and is such that mv \u226a \u03bdp \u226a m and \u03bdus is the cut-off of the three-momentum\nof the photons and light fermions with mv 2 \u226a \u03bdus \u226a mv.\nThe pNRQED Lagrangian reads as follows (iDS0 = i\u22020 + g(Z \u2212 1)A0 ):\nLpNRQED =\n\u2212V\n\n(0)\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n3\n\n(\n\nd xd XS (x, X, t) iDS0 \u2212 ck\n\u2020\n\np4\np2\n+ c4 3 +\n2m\n8m\n\nV (1) V (2)\n\u2212\n\u2212 2 + gVA x * E(X, t) S(x, X, t) \u2212\nm\nm\n)\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\nd3 X F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ,\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere x and X, and p and P are the relative and center of mass coordinate and momentum\nrespectively. All the gauge fields in Eq. (9) are functions of the center-of-mass coordinate\nand the time t only. We have explicitly written only the terms relevant to the analysis at\nthe NNLL.\nWe now display the structure of the matching potentials V (0) , V (1) and V (2) , which are\nthe relevant ones to our analysis. At order 1/m0 , we have the static potential:\nV (0) \u2261 \u2212Z\n\n\u03b1V\n.\nr\n\n(10)\n(1)\n\nIn principle, at order 1/m, we may have a potential scaling as Vm \u223c mr1 2 . Nevertheless, it\nvanishes at the order we are working. It would give, at most, O(m\u03b16 ) corrections to the\nspectrum in a finite order calculation and the running equations would not mix with it.\nTherefore, for the purposes of this paper, we approximate\nV (1)\n\u2243 0.\nm\n\n(11)\n\nAt order 1/m2 , to the accuracy we aim at, V (2) has the structure\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nV (2)\n\u03c0ZDd (3)\n3ZDLS 1\n=\n\u03b4 (r) +\nL1 * S1 ,\n2\n2\nm\nm\n2m2 r 3\n\n(12)\n\nwhere S1 = \u03c3 1 /2. In principle, one may consider more structures for the 1/m2 potential\nbut, since they will not contribute at the accuracy we aim and in order to focus the problem\nas much as possible, we will set them to zero in what follows, as we have done for the 1/m\npotential.\nThe coefficients, \u1e7c = {\u03b1Vs , Ds , ...} contain some ln r dependence once higher order\ncorrections to their leading (non-vanishing) values are taken into account. In particular,\nwe will have expressions like \u03b4 (3) (r) lnn r. This is not a well-defined distribution and should\nbe understood as the Fourier transform of lnn 1/k. Nevertheless, in order to use the same\nnotation for all the matching coefficients, and since it will be sufficient for the purposes of\nthis paper, namely to resum the leading logs, we will use the expression \u03b4 (3) (r) lnn r, although\nit should always be understood in the sense given above.\nBy studying the UV behavior of pNRQED it is possible to obtain the scale dependence\nof the coefficients of the potentials \u1e7c . The discussion closely follows the one of Ref. [1] to\nwhich we refer for details. Here we just mention the main points. The potentials have the\nfollowing structure:\n\u1e7c (d(\u03bdp , \u03bds , m), c(\u03bds , m), \u03bds , \u03bdus , r) = \u1e7c (\u03bdp , m, \u03bdus , r) \u2261 \u1e7c (\u03bdp , \u03bdus ) .\n\n(13)\n\nIn particular,\n\nd\n\u1e7c = 0.\nd\u03bds\nMoreover, at the accuracy we aim, we also get\n\u03bds\n\n\u03bdp\n\nd\n\u1e7c = 0.\nd\u03bdp\n3\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n\fTherefore, we obtain\n\u1e7c (\u03bdp , \u03bdus ) \u2243 \u1e7c (\u03bdus )\n\n(16)\n\nand we only have to compute the \u03bdus scale dependence.\nThe \u03bdus -scale dependence could be obtained along the same lines as in Ref. [1]. We\nobtain in this specific case:\nd\n\u03b12\n\u03b1s = \u2212\u03b20 ,\nd\u03bdus\n2\u03c0\n4 \u03b1(\u03bdus ) 2 2\nd\n(2)\nDd = \u2212\nVA ck \u03b1(r \u22121 ) ,\n\u03bdus\nd\u03bdus\n3 \u03c0\n\u03bdus\n\n(17)\n\nand zero for the other potentials.\nEqs. (14), (15) and (17) provide the complete set of RG equations at the desired order.\nBy using Eqs. (14) and (15), we obtain\n\u1e7c = \u1e7c (d(1/r, m), c(1/r, m), \u03bds = 1/r, \u03bdus , r) .\n\n(18)\n\nWe now need the initial condition in order to solve the US RG equations, i.e. the matching\nconditions. We fix the initial point at \u03bdus = 1/r. In summary, we need to know the\nstatic potential with O(\u03b13 ) accuracy, the 1/m potential with O(\u03b12) accuracy, the 1/m2\npotentials with O(\u03b1) accuracy and VA with O(1) accuracy at \u03bdus = 1/r. For the nonvanishing potentials, they read\n(\n\n\u03b1(r \u22121)\n4\u03c0\n\"\n!\n#\n)\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03b12 (r \u22121 )\n2\n2\n+ \u03b3E (4a1 \u03b20 + 2\u03b21 ) +\n,\n+ 4\u03b3E \u03b20 + a2\n3\n16 \u03c0 2\n\u22121\n(2) \u22121\n\u22121 cD (r )\n,\nDd (r ) = \u03b1(r )\n2\n\u03b1(r \u22121 )\n(2)\nDLS,s (r \u22121 ) =\ncS (r \u22121 ),\n3\nVA (r \u22121 ) = 1,\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b1V (r ) = \u03b1(r ) 1 + (a1 + 2\u03b3E \u03b20 )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b21 = \u22124TF nf and the values of a1 and a2 can be easily obtained from the QCD results\n[17] by taking Cf \u2192 1, CA \u2192 0 and TF \u2192 1.\nWe now have all the necessary ingredients to solve the RG equations. The RG improved\npotentials read:\n\u03b1V (\u03bdus ) = \u03b1V (r \u22121 ),\n(2)\nDd (\u03bdus )\n(2)\n\n=\n\n(2)\nDd (r \u22121 )\n\n\u03b1(r \u22121 )\n8\n\u03b1(r \u22121 ) log\n\u2212\n3\u03b20\n\u03b1(\u03bdus )\n\n!\n\n\u03b1(r \u22121)\n16\n\u03b1(m)\n=\n1\u2212\nlog\n2\n3\u03b20\n\u03b1(\u03bdus )\n\n(2)\n\nDLS (\u03bdus ) = DLS (r \u22121 ).\n\n!!\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\nThis completes the RG evaluation of the pNRQED Lagrangian at NNLL.\n4\n\n\fWith the above results we can obtain the energy with NNLL accuracy. The discussion\ngoes similar to the one in Ref. [1]. All the large logs can be obtained from the potential terms.\nOnce the potentials are introduced in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the lnn (1/r) terms produce\nlnn (m\u03b1) terms plus subleading contributions (lnn\u22121 (m\u03b1), * * *) within the LL resummation\ncounting. The expectation value of the potential terms is \u03bdus -scale dependent. This scale\ndependence is cancelled by the ultraviolet scale dependence of ultrasoft loops. The typical\nscales in these integrals is of the order m\u03b12 . Therefore, the logs of the ultrasoft loops\nget minimized by setting \u03bdus \u223c m\u03b12 and all the large logs get encoded in the potential\ncontributions. Finally, one obtains the following correction to the NNLO energy expression:\npot\n\u03b4En,l,j\n(\u03bdus )\n\n= En \u03b1\n\n2Z\n\n2\n\n!\n\n!\n\n\u03b4l0\n16\n\u03b1(\u03bdus )\n\u2212 log\n\u2212 3(cD \u2212 1) ,\n3n\n\u03b20\n\u03b1\n\n(21)\n\nwhere En = \u2212mZ 2 \u03b12 /(2n2 ) and the scale \u03bds in z and in the NRQED matching coefficients\nmZ\u03b1(2a\u22121\n\u22121\nn )\nhas been fixed to the soft scale \u03bds = 2a\u22121\n. \u03b1 is also understood at\nn , where an =\nn\nthe soft scale \u03bds = 2a\u22121\nunless\nthe\nscale\nis\nspecified.\nThe\n\u03bd\n-scale\ndependence of Eq. (21)\nus\nn\n2\ncancels against contributions from US energies. Since m\u03b1 is the next relevant scale, their\neffective role will be to replace \u03bdus by m\u03b12 (up to finite pieces that we are systematically\nneglecting) in Eq. (21). In particular, we take \u03bdus = \u2212En . As expected, Eq. (21) with\n\u03bdus = \u2212En reproduces the well known Hydrogen-like O(m\u03b15 ln \u03b1) correction but, indeed,\nEq. (21) gives all the O(m\u03b14(\u03b1 ln \u03b1)n ) terms for n \u2265 1 of the spectrum of the Hydrogen-like\nsystems with nf massless fermions. After adding to Eq. (21) the NNLO result with the\nnormalization point at the same soft scale, \u03bds = 2a\u22121\nn , that we have used here, the complete\nNNLL mass is obtained. Note that the above resummation of logs also correctly accounts\nfor ln Z terms with the same accuracy.\nWe have seen that the large logs of the spectrum can be obtained from the potential\nterms by setting 1/r \u223c m\u03b1 and \u03bdus \u223c m\u03b12 . The velocity of the non-relativistic particle is\ntypically v \u223c Z\u03b1. Therefore, it is interesting to consider the scaling of the potentials with\nrespect v as it will help us to later compare with vNRQED results. In practice, we will\nconsider its scaling with respect \u03bd \u2261 mv (therefore \u03bdus = \u03bd 2 /m) where\n\u1e7c (\u03bdp , m, \u03bdus , r) \u2243 \u1e7c (m, \u03bdus , r) \u2192 \u1e7c (m, \u03bd 2 /m, 1/\u03bd) \u2261 \u1e7c (\u03bd) .\n\n(22)\n\n(2)\n\nWe can now consider its derivative with respect \u03bd. We will just focus on Dd since it is the\nonly one which has a non-trivial running. We obtain\n\u03bd\n\n8 \u03b1(\u03bd) \u03bd 2\n\u03b20\n4 \u03b12 (\u03bd)\n\u03b1(\u03bd)\nd (2)\nDd = \u2212 cD (\u03bd)\u03b12 (\u03bd) +\nln \u03bd 2 \u2212\n\u03b1( ) .\nd\u03bd\n4\u03c0\n3 \u03c0\nm\n\u03b1( m ) 3 \u03c0\n\n(23)\n\nIt is remarkable that the above expression can be rearranged as\n\u03bd\n\n\u03b20\n\u03bd2\n8 \u03b1(\u03bd) \u03bd 2\nd (2)\nDd = \u2212 cD ( )\u03b12 (\u03bd) \u2212\n\u03b1( ) .\nd\u03bd\n4\u03c0\nm\n3 \u03c0\nm\n\n(24)\n\nThere is an evaluation [4] within the vNRQCD framework [7] of the RG improved Heavy\nQuarkonium mass when \u039bQCD \u226a m\u03b1s2 . The evaluation performed within the pNRQCD\n5\n\n\fframework [1] disagreed with that evaluation. It was noticed there that the disagreement\nstill persisted if one considered a QED-like limit with light fermions by taking Cf \u2192 1,\nCA \u2192 0 and TF \u2192 1. Agreement was found for a QED-like limit without light fermions by\ntaking Cf \u2192 1, CA \u2192 0, nf \u2192 0, TF \u2192 1. Some errors seem to have been detected in the\nfirst versions of these calculations in vNRQCD [18] that may partially explain the difference,\nin particular for the 1/m2 potential. In this case, agreement may exist in the limit Cf \u2192 1,\nCA \u2192 0 and TF \u2192 1.\nFor the evaluation performed in this paper, the computation of the spectrum for the\ncase of Hydrogen-like atoms with massless fermions, there exists no analogous within the\nvNRQED framework. Nevertheless, it is possible to guess what would be the result in that\nformulation by using the rules of Ref. [19], which relate the anomalous dimensions computed\n(2)\nhere with the ones that should appear in vNRQED. For the specific case of Dd , we obtain\n\u03bd\n\nd (2)\nD (vNRQED) = \u03b3s + 2\u03b3u ,\nd\u03bd d\n\n(25)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b20\n4 \u03b1(\u03bd) \u03bd 2\ncD (\u03bd)\u03b12 (\u03bd) ,\n\u03b3us = \u2212\n\u03b1( ) .\n(26)\n4\u03c0\n3 \u03c0\nm\nThis should be compared with the running in pNRQED obtained above. If we do so, we\nfind that Eqs. (25) and (24) are different. If expanded in \u03b1 they first differ at O(\u03b12 log2 \u03b1).\nThis produces a difference in the computation of the mass at O(m\u03b16 log2 \u03b1). In order to\nperform an independent check, it would be extremally important that corrections of this\norder had been computed before. The closest system to the one discussed here corresponds\nto the muonic hydrogen for which, indeed, corrections to the energy at this order have been\ncomputed by Pachucki [12]. In order to compare our results with his evaluation, we have to\ntake the limit nf \u2192 1. Moreover, for the real muonic hydrogen, the mass of the light fermion\n(the electron in this case) is not negligible. However, we can formally consider the situation\nme \u223c m\u03b12 (even if for the physical situation me \u223c m\u03b1 is closer to reality) in his and our\ncalculation. For the matter of comparison, in our case, this means that, for scales of the\norder of me and m\u03b12 , we can use the low energy electromagnetic coupling \u03b1em \u223c 1/137....\nThis is indeed the parameter expansion used in Pachucki's calculation. A closer inspection\nshows that the diagrams that give rise to the large logs computed here correspond to the\nones drawn in Fig. 4 in Ref. [12]. If we reexpand our result in terms of \u03b1em = \u03b1(\u03bdus ), we\nobtain (up to the order of interest and with v \u223c \u03b1)\n\u03b3s = \u2212\n\n(2)\nDd\n\n\u03b1(\u03bd)\n\u03b20\n\u03b1(\u03bdus )\nmv 2\n\u2212\n1 + \u03b1(\u03bdus ) ln\n=\n+***\n2\n2\n2\u03c0\nmv\n\n!\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b1(\u03bdus )\n8 \u03b1(\u03bdus ) mv 2 2\nln\n\u2212 \u03b20\n\u00d7 \uf8ed\u2212\n3 \u03c0\nm\n3\n\u03c0\n\u2243 \u2212\n\n(27)\n!2\n\n\uf8f6\n\nmv 2\n+ * * *\uf8f8\nln2\nm\n\n4 \u03b12 (\u03bdus ) mv 2 2\u03b20 \u03b13 (\u03bdus ) mv 2 mv 2 1 \u03b13 (\u03bdus ) 2 mv 2\nln\n\u2212\nln\nln\n\u2212 \u03b20\nln\n.\n3 \u03c0\nm\n3\n\u03c02\nmv\nm\n3\n\u03c02\nm\n\nIt is easy to identify the above terms (last equality) within a diagrammatic picture. The\nfirst term is the standard Lamb-shift correction one would find for the Hydrogen atom and\n6\n\n\fcorresponds to the diagrams of Fig. 4 of Ref. [12] without any bubble insertion. The second\nterm corresponds to the first diagram in Fig. 4 of Ref. [12]. The last term corresponds\nto the second diagram in Fig. 4 of Ref. [12]. Therefore, our result seems to have the\ncorrect structure for the O(m\u03b16 ln2 ) corrections. Let us now go deeper in the comparison\nwith Pachucki's results. First, we can see that the last term of Eq. (27) can reproduce the\nanalogous Pachucki's contribution by setting \u03b1(\u03bdus ) = \u03b1em and \u03bdus = me (this result depends\non the two-loop muon form factor first computed in Ref. [20]). For the second term of Eq.\n(27), the explicit comparison is a little bit more involved. Nevertheless, it is possible to see\nthat the first term in Eq. (39) of Ref. [12] gives the logs of the second term in Eq. (27) since\none can make the replacement (as far as the LL contribution is concerned)\nVV P\n\nZ\u03b1(\u03bdus ) \u03b20\nmv 2\n\u2192\u2212\n\u03b1(\u03bdus ) ln\nr\n2\u03c0\nmv\n\"\n\n#\n\n(28)\n\nfor VV P , as defined in Ref. [12]1 . The second term in Eq. (39) of Ref. [12] gives the logs due\nto expanding the wave-function at the origen \u223c (m\u03b1)3 (which are naturally written in terms\nof \u03b1(\u03bd)) in terms of \u03b1em . Therefore, we can trace back all the logs of the computation in Ref.\n[12]. This provides a check of our calculation to a level where it starts to first differ with\nwhat would be the vNRQED result. Nevertheless, it may happen that, if the corrections\nof the vNRQCD results for the equal mass calculation are finally confirmed, they may also\nexplain the different result obtained here.\nIn conclusion, we have computed the energy spectrum at NNLL for an Hydrogen-like\nsystem with nf massless fermions. We have checked our results at O(m\u03b16 ln2 ) by comparing\nwith results already available in the literature [12] for muonic Hydrogen and agreement has\nbeen found. We have also compared with what we would expect to be the result in the\nvNRQED framework based on the rules of [19] and disagreement has been found. Finally,\nwe would like to mention that the above results can be useful in checking higher order logs in\ncomputations of the spectrum for muonic atoms or alike where the electron can be considered\nto be a light particle.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank A.

After this paper was sent to the hep-ph archives a new paper hep-ph/0204299\nappeared in the net where it was pointed out that there was a systematic error in the\nvNRQCD computations to date and that the diagram Fig. 20b in this reference should be\nincluded in such computations. After its inclusion, the corrected 1/m2 potential obtained\nin vNRQCD agrees with the 1/m2 potential obtained in pNRQCD [1], the replacement\ncD (\u03bd) \u2192 cD (\u03bd 2 /m) should be done in Eq. (26) and the new result of vNRQED for the\nmuonic hydrogen spectrum agrees with our result.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nWe note that for this diagram both loops factorize.
