Singh, Lal Muanzuala, and Vasant Natarajan\u2217\n\narXiv:1103.1042v1 [physics.optics] 5 Mar 2011\n\nDepartment of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560 012, INDIA\nWe have developed a technique to measure the absolute frequencies of optical transitions by using\nan evacuated Rb-stabilized ring-cavity resonator as a transfer cavity. We study possible wavelengthdependent errors due to dispersion at the cavity mirrors by measuring the frequency of the same\ntransition in the D2 line of Cs at three cavity lengths. We find no discernable change in values\nwithin our error of 30 kHz. Our values are consistent with measurements using the frequency-comb\ntechnique and have similar accuracy.\nPACS numbers: 06.30.Ft,42.62.Eh,42.60.Da\n\nPrecise measurement of the absolute frequencies of\natomic transitions have played an important role in the\ndevelopment of physics. This is perhaps best exemplified\nby the measurement of the small Lamb shift between the\n2S1/2 and 2P1/2 levels of hydrogen, which led to the birth\nof quantum electrodynamics (QED), our most-successful\nphysical theory to date. Since the SI standard of frequency or time is defined using a hyperfine transition in\nthe Cs atom (\u2248 9.1 GHz, which is in the microwave region), it is a challenge to measure the absolute frequency\nof an optical transition for it means that one has to span\nsix orders of magnitude without loss in accuracy. In recent times, the use of a femtosecond frequency comb [1]\ngenerated by a laser beam in a nonlinear fiber has enabled such a span. The uniform spacing of the comb is\nin the microwave region and directly referenced to the\natomic clock, while the laser frequency is in the visible\nregion.\nAround the same time, we have developed an alternate\ntechnique to measure the frequencies of optical transitions [2\u20134], which gives similar accuracy especially when\nthe measurement is limited by errors in spectroscopy.\nThe technique uses an evacuated ring-cavity resonator\nwhose length is calibrated against a hyperfine transition\nin the D2 line of Rb. The absolute frequency of this line\nhas been measured to a relative accuracy of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221211\nusing a frequency chain referenced to the atomic standard\n[5]. Thus, the Rb line acts as a secondary standard in the\noptical regime and the ring-cavity as a transfer cavity, so\nthat the absolute frequency of an unknown laser can be\ndetermined.\nThe basic idea of the measurement scheme can be understood by referring to Fig. 1. The cavity is brought\ninto simultaneous resonance for both lasers, so that the\nratio of the two frequencies is a ratio of two integer mode\nnumbers. While the resonance condition cannot be satisfied simultaneously for two arbitrary frequencies, it can\nbe satisfied if we use an acousto-optic modulator (AOM)\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\nvasant@physics.iisc.ernet.in;\nURL: www.physics.iisc.ernet.in/~ vasant\n\nUnknown\ndiode laser\n852 nm\n\nReference\ndiode laser\n780 nm\n\nLock\nlaser\n\n\u03bb/2\n\nLock\nlaser\n\n\u03bb/2\n\nCs sat. abs.\nspectrometer\n\nPBS\n\n\u03bb/2\n\nRb sat. abs.\nspectrometer\n\nPBS\nAOM\n\nLock\nAOM\n\nPBS\nM\n\n\u03bb/2\n\nFiber\nPBS\nPD\n\nVacuum\nPD\n\nPZT\n\nLock\ncavity\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the experiment.

The resonance condition for a cavity\nlength L can be written as\nL = n\u03bb ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the mode number and \u03bb is the wavelength.\nFor an evacuated cavity, \u03bb = c/\u03bd, where \u03bd is the frequency. Thus, the ratio of the unknown to the reference\nfrequencies is given by\n\u03bdunk\nnunk\n=\n.\n\u03bdref + \u03bdAOM\nnref\n\n(2)\n\nA knowledge of the cavity length (or mode numbers)\ncombined with a measurement of the AOM frequency\nconstitutes a measurement of the unknown frequency.\nAlthough the use of an evacuated cavity enables us\nto get the optical frequency, Eq. 1 shows that the technique is essentially a wavelength comparison. We must\ntherefore be careful about possible systematic errors due\n\n\f2\nto wavelength-dependent effects. We have shown earlier\nthat the Guoy phase (due to diffraction) is wavelength\nindependent in a ring cavity and therefore does not constitute a source of error [4]. Another potential error arises\ndue to wavelength-dependent phase shifts (as a result of\ndispersion) at the cavity mirrors. This can modify the\nresonance condition in Eq. 1 either due to a constant\nphase offset or the Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift, or both. However, we have a good experimental handle to address this\nsource of error, namely to measure the frequency at different cavity lengths. Since the phase error due to dispersion at the mirrors is constant while the accumulated\nphase due to light propagation increases with length, the\nvalues at different cavity lengths should give us an idea\nof the size of this error.\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive study of errors due to mirror dispersion by measuring the frequency\nof the D2 line in Cs at three cavity lengths. In earlier\nwork [4, 6], we have estimated this error by varying the\ncavity length, but we could vary it only by about 25%;\nhere we vary it by almost a factor of 2. We find no significant difference in the values over this variation in length.\nWe also compare our values to measurements using a frequency comb, and find reasonably good agreement.\nThe experimental details are as follows (see Fig. 1).\nThe reference laser is a home-built diode laser system\nwhich is frequency stabilized using grating feedback [7].\nThe linewidth after stabilization is about 1 MHz. It is\nlocked to a hyperfine transition on the D2 line of 87 Rb\n(5S 1/2 \u2192 5P 3/2 transition) at 780 nm using fm modulation in a saturated-absorption spectroscopy set up.\nThe unknown laser is a similar diode laser system operating at 852 nm. It is similarly locked to a hyperfine\ntransition on the D2 line of 133 Cs (6S 1/2 \u2192 6P 3/2 transition), but modulated at a slightly different frequency.\nThe two laser beams with orthogonal linear polarizations\nare mixed on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and coupled into a single-mode fiber. The use of the fiber guarantees that the two beams enter the cavity at exactly\nthe same angle, thereby avoiding potential errors due to\ndifferential excitation of higher-order cavity modes. The\nbeams entering the cavity have a size of 2 mm and power\nof 1 mW each. The cavity is evacuated with a pump and\nmaintained at a pressure of \u223c 10\u22123 torr. The power reflected from the input coupler of the cavity is split into\nits two linear components using a PBS. The second plane\nmirror of the cavity is mounted on a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). The PZT is modulated at 35 kHz to generate error signals for locking. The demodulated signal\nfrom the unknown laser is used to lock the cavity on resonance, while the demodulated signal from the reference\nlaser is used to lock the frequency of the AOM driver.\nThis frequency is read using a frequency counter with a\ntimebase stability of 10\u22128 .\nTo establish the cavity length uniquely, the same frequency is measured with the reference laser on an F =\n1 \u2192 F \u2032 transition, and on an F = 2 \u2192 F \u2032 transition.\nThis changes the frequency of the reference laser by a\n\nTABLE I: Transition frequencies measured at three cavity\nlengths.

Then there is only\none mode number combination that satisfies Eq. 2. In\nother words, the change of the reference laser frequency\nby a known amount gives us a measurement of the freespectral-range (FSR) of the cavity, and hence its length.\nThe results of measurements at three cavity lengths \u2013\n177, 220, and 315 mm, are listed in Table I. There are\nthree hyperfine transitions starting from the upper level\nof the ground state, and we have measured the frequency\nfor each transition. In order to keep statistical errors below 5 kHz, we set the integration time in the frequency\ncounter to 10 s. Then we take an average of 20\u201330 independent readings. The most important thing to note\nfrom the table is that the measured values at the three\nlengths are within a few kHz of each other. Since the uncertainty of the lock to a cavity peak is about 30 kHz, the\nobserved variation can be explained solely on the basis of\nlock-point uncertainty. Thus any error due to dispersion\nat the mirrors is less than our detectable limit. This is\nalso what we had found in earlier studies [4, 6], but there\nwe were only able to reduce the length from 220 mm to\n175 mm. Here, we see no significant change even when\nwe increase the length to 315 mm.\nIt therefore seems likely that there is some effect that\ncauses the wavelength dependence to cancel in our ringcavity geometry. One possible explanation is shown in\nFig. 2 where we consider the Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift at a\nmultilayer dielectric mirror. The point of emergence (Gi )\ndepends on the wavelength (\u03bbi ). In addition, the phase\nof the wave at Gi depends on the phase at the reflection\npoint and therefore on \u03bbi . It is possible that these two\ncancel exactly to make the cavity resonance condition\nwavelength independent. Note that the Goos-H\u00e4nchen\nshift will be zero in a linear cavity where the angle of\nincidence at the mirrors is 0\u25e6 , thus there cannot be a\ncancelation of this kind.\nIn the above set of measurements, we did not have to\nworry about spectroscopic errors since we were measuring\nthe same transition at the three lengths. We were only\ninterested in finding out if this value changes, and not\nthe value itself. However, if we can estimate the error\nin the Cs spectrometer, we can make a comparison of\n\n\f3\nMultilayer dielectric\n\n0\n\nG1\n\nG2\n\u03bb1\n\n\u03bb2\n\nFIG. 2: Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift at a multilayer dielectric mirror for a non-zero angle of incidence.

[9] for all three transitions. However, the\nvalues from Gerginov et al. [10] only overlap for the first\ntwo transitions. For the third transition (i.e., F = 4 \u2192\nF \u2032 = 5), their value is 2 \u03c3 away from that of Udem et al.\nand 4.4 \u03c3 away from ours. This transition is also involved\nin determining the {5 \u2212 4} hyperfine interval in the P3/2\nstate. It is perhaps relevant to note that the value of this\ninterval measured by Gerginov et al. [11], presumably\nusing the same spectrometer, is 4.6 \u03c3 discrepant from an\nearlier measurement by Tanner and Wieman [12] and 9 \u03c3\ndiscrepant from a measurement from our group [13].\nDespite this minor discrepancy, we feel that our values\nare sufficiently consistent with the frequency comb results\nto be able to conclude that there is no unknown systematic error plaguing our spectrometer. The measured values in Table I also show that there is no discernible trend\ndue to dispersion when we change the cavity length by\nalmost a factor of two. This is certainly the same observation that we made in earlier studies. We have given\na possible explanation for this lack of wavelength dependence in terms of cancelation of the phase shift and the\nGoos-H\u00e4nchen shift. This is another advantage of the\nring cavity over a linear cavity; the Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift\nis not present in a linear cavity because of the zero angle\nof incidence on the mirrors.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology, India.
