(1)\n2\n2\n\nHere 12 \u2206\u03a3 (\u2206g) describes the net integrated contribution\nof quark and anti-quark (gluon) helicities to the nucleon\nhelicity and Lqz (Lgz ) is the z component of the orbital\nangular momentum among all quarks (gluons). The individual terms in the sum are dependent on scale \u03bc and\nfactorization scheme, and the decomposition of the gluon\ntotal angular momentum Jzg (\u03bc2 ) = \u2206g(\u03bc2 ) + Lgz (\u03bc2 ) is\nnot gauge invariant.\nDetailed information about \u2206\u03a3 and its flavor decomposition into the contributions from quarks and antiquarks can be obtained from various sources. In the context of this paper, double-spin asymmetries of cross sections in inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) l + N \u2192\nl + X of longitudinally polarized charged leptons off longitudinally polarized nucleons are considered, where only\nthe scattered charged lepton is observed but not the\nhadronic final state X. Inclusive scattering is sensitive\nto the square of the quark charges, and therefore cannot distinguish quarks from anti-quarks. This distinction\ncan be made in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering\nl + N \u2192 l + h + X, where in addition to the scattered\nlepton one or more hadrons, produced in the reaction,\nare recorded [1, 2].\nThe theoretical and experimental status on the spin\nstructure of the nucleon has been discussed in great detail\nin several recent reviews (see, e.g., Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and\nreferences therein). Here only the essential ingredients\nwill be summarized.\nIn lowest order perturbation theory, the deep-inelastic\nreaction l + N \u2192 l + X proceeds via the exchange of\n\n\u2217 Present address: Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility,\nNewport News, Virginia 23606, USA\n\na neutral virtual boson (\u03b3 \u2217 , Z 0 ). At HERMES centerof-mass energies contributions from Z 0 -exchange to the\ncross section can be safely neglected. Therefore only the\nelectromagnetic interaction in the approximation of onephoton exchange is taken into account here. In this approximation, the cross section of polarized inclusive DIS\nis parameterized by two spin structure functions g1 and\ng2 . These functions cannot presently be calculated from\nthe QCD Lagrangian.\nIn the QCD-improved quark parton model (QPM), i.e.,\nat leading twist, and to leading logarithmic order in the\nrunning strong coupling constant \u03b1s (Q2 ) of QuantumChromodynamics (LO QCD), the deep-inelastic scattering off the nucleon can be interpreted as the incoherent\nsuperposition of virtual-photon interactions with quarks\nof any flavour q. By angular momentum conservation,\na spin- 12 parton can absorb a hard photon only when\ntheir spin orientations are opposite. Polarized photons\nwith the same (opposite) helicity as the polarized target\nnucleon consequently probe the quark number density\n2\n2\n\u21c0 (x, Q ) (q \u21c0 (x, Q )) for quarks with the same (oppoq\u21d2\n\u21d0\nsite) helicity as that of the parent nucleon. The spin\nstructure function g1 has then a probabilistic interpretation, which for the proton and the neutron reads:\ng1p,n (x, Q2 ) =\n\n\u0003\n1 X 2 \u0002 p,n\ne \u2206q (x, Q2 ) + \u2206q\u0304 p,n (x, Q2 )\n2 q q\n=\n\n\u0003\n1 2 \u0002\np,n\n2\nhe i \u2206qS (x, Q2 ) + \u2206qN\nS (x, Q ) . (2)\n2\n\nHere, the quantity \u2212Q2 is the squared four-momentum\ntransferred by the virtual photon, x is the fraction of\nthe nucleon's light-cone momentum carried by the struck\nquark, eq is the charge, in units of P\nthe elementary charge\n|e|, of quarks of flavor q, he2 i = q e2q /Nq is the average squared charge of the Nq active quark flavors, and\n2\n2\n\u21c0 (x, Q ) \u2212 q \u21c0 (x, Q ) is the quark helicity\n\u2206q(x, Q2 ) = q\u21d2\n\u21d0\n1\ndistribution for massless quarks of flavor q in a longitudinally polarized nucleon in the 'infinite-momentum frame'.\n2\n2\n\u21c0 (x, Q ) and q\u0304 \u21c0 (x, Q )\nCorrespondingly, \u2206q\u0304(x, Q2 ), q\u0304\u21d2\n\u21d0\nare anti-quark distributions.

For the analysis\npresented in this paper, only the three lightest quark flavors, q = u, d, s, are taken into account and the number\nof active quark flavors Nq is equal to three.\nQuantities of particular importance are the first moments of the quark helicity distributions:\nZ 1\n2\ndx \u2206q(x, Q2 ) .\n(5)\n\u2206q(Q ) =\n0\n\nThe quantity (\u2206q(Q2 ) + \u2206q\u0304(Q2 )) is the net number of\nquarks plus antiquarks of flavor q with positive helicity\ninside a nucleon with positive helicity and thus 12 \u2206\u03a3(Q2 )\nis the net contribution to the nucleon's helicity that can\nbe attributed to the helicities of the quarks.\nIn LO QCD the gluon distribution does not contribute\nexplicitly in Eq. (2) to the structure function g1 (x, Q2 ),\nbut it does appear in the QCD evolution equations [8] for\ng1 . Beyond leading order QCD, also gluons have to be\ntaken explicitly into account in the expression for g1 , with\n\u2206g(x, Q2 ) being the gluon helicity distribution. The first\nR1\nmoment \u2206g(Q2 ) = 0 dx \u2206g(x, Q2 ) represents the total\ngluon helicity contribution to the helicity of the nucleon.\nIf the electromagnetic currents in the nucleon are\ntreated as fields of free quarks of only the lightest three\nflavors, the first moment of the structure function g1 can\nbe decomposed into contributions from the axial charges\na3 , a8 , and a0 , which are related to the hadronic matrix\nelements of the octet plus singlet quark SU(3) axial vector currents. In the scaling (Bjorken) limit,\nZ 1\n1\np,n\n2\n\u03931 (Q ) =\ndx g1p,n (x, Q2 ) =\n(a8 \u00b1 3a3 + 4a0 ) .\n36\n0\n(6)\nHere the +(\u2212) sign of the a3 term holds for the proton\n(neutron). In the naive quark model, the axial charges\nare related to the first moments of quark helicity distributions by\n \u0304\na3 = (\u2206u + \u2206\u016b) \u2212 (\u2206d + \u2206d),\n\n \u0304 \u2212 2(\u2206s + \u2206s\u0304),\na8 = (\u2206u + \u2206\u016b) + (\u2206d + \u2206d)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nThe quantities on either side of Eqs. (7) and (8) are flavor\nnon-singlet quantities and independent of Q2 to any order\nin \u03b1s (Q2 ). Beyond LO, a0 becomes dependent on Q2 ,\nand \u2206\u03a3 may or may not be the same and may or may\nnot depend on Q2 , depending on the factorization scheme\nchosen [9, 10].\nIn the approximation of SU(3) flavor symmetry and of\nidentical masses of up-, down-, and strange-quarks, the\nfundamental non-singlet quantities a3 and a8 can be related to the two decay constants F and D which govern\nthe Gamow-Teller part of the flavor-changing weak decays in the spin- 21 baryon octet [3]: a3 = F + D and\na8 = 3F \u2212 D. Here the values F = 0.464 \u00b1 0.008 and\nD = 0.806 \u00b1 0.008 are used as obtained from a fit to recent hyperon decay data [11], leading to a3 = F + D =\ngA /gV = 1.269 \u00b1 0.003 and a8 = 3F \u2212 D = 0.586 \u00b1 0.031,\nwith negligible correlation between a3 and a8 . Measurements of one of the spin structure functions g1p,n,d and its\nfirst moment provide via Eqs. (6) to (8) the third necessary input for the determination of the flavor-singlet axial charge a0 , and thereby also of \u2206\u03a3 and the moments\nof the helicity distributions of the three quark flavors\n \u0304 and (\u2206s + \u2206s\u0304).\n(\u2206u + \u2206\u016b), (\u2206d + \u2206d)\nAt any order in \u03b1s (Q2 ) and in a leading-twist approximation, the structure function g1 is a convolution\nof quark, anti-quark and gluon helicity distributions [12]\nwith Wilson coefficient functions \u2206C(x, \u03b1s (Q2 )) [13]:\ng1p,n (x, Q2 ) =\nZ 1 \u2032h\n\u0010x\n\u0011\n1 2\ndx\n2\n\u2206C\n,\n\u03b1\n(Q\n)\n\u2206qS (x\u2032 , Q2 )\nhe i\nS\ns\n\u2032\n2\nx\u2032\nx x\n\u0010x\n\u0011\n2\n+ 2Nq \u2206Cg\n,\n\u03b1\n(Q\n)\n\u2206g(x\u2032 , Q2 )\ns\n\u2032\nx\n\u0010x\n\u0011\ni\np,n\np,n\n\u2032\n2\n+ \u2206CN\n, \u03b1s (Q2 ) \u2206qN\nS\nS (x , Q ) . (10)\n\u2032\nx\nIn LO Eq. (10) reduces to Eq. (2) since then \u2206CS and\n\u2206CN S become \u03b4 functions and \u2206Cg vanishes. The factorization between the helicity distributions and the coefficient functions involves some arbitrary choice, and\nhence the distributions and their moments depend on the\nfactorization scheme. The structure function g1 (x, Q2 ),\nas a physical observable, is scheme independent. There\nare straightforward transformations that relate different\nschemes and their results to each other. In the 'modified minimal subtraction' (M S) scheme [14], the factorization scheme commonly used in most of the present\nNLO analyses of unpolarized deep-inelastic and hard processes, the first moment of the gluon coefficient function\nvanishes and \u2206g(Q2 ) does not contribute to the first\nmoment of g1 . Therefore \u03931 can be directly related to\nMS\n\na0 (Q2 ) = \u2206\u03a3(Q2 ).\n\n\f4\nIn the M S scheme, Eq. (6) becomes\n2\n\u0393p,n\n1 (Q ) =\n\n1 h\nMS\n2\n(a8 \u00b1 3a3 )\u2206CN\nS (\u03b1s (Q ))\n36\ni\n+4a0 \u2206CSMS (\u03b1s (Q2 )) ,\n\n(11)\n\nMS\n2\nMS\n2\nwhere \u2206CN\nS (\u03b1s (Q )) and \u2206CS (\u03b1s (Q )) are the first\nmoments of the non-singlet and singlet Wilson coefficient\nfunctions, respectively.\nThe difference of the g1 moments for proton and neutron leads to the Bjorken Sum Rule [15, 16], which in\nleading twist reads:\n\n\u0393p1 (Q2 ) \u2212 \u0393n1 (Q2 ) =\n\n1\nMS\n2\na3 \u2206CN\nS (\u03b1s (Q )),\n6\n\n(12)\n\nwhile their sum is given by:\n\u0393p1 (Q2 ) + \u0393n1 (Q2 ) =\n\n1 h\nMS\n2\na8 \u2206CN\nS (\u03b1s (Q ))\n18\ni\n\n+4a0 \u2206CSMS (\u03b1s (Q2 )) . (13)\nThis sum equals twice the deuteron moment apart from\na small correction due to the D-wave admixture to the\ndeuteron wave function (see Eq. (23)). The measurement\nof \u0393d1 hence allows for a straightforward determination of\na0 using only a8 as additional input.\nIn the M S scheme, the non-singlet (singlet) coefficient\nhas been calculated up to third (second) order in the\nstrong coupling constant [17]:\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00113\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\n\u03b1s\ns\ns\n\u221220.215\n\u22123.583\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(14)\n\u0010\u03b1 \u0011\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112\ns\ns\n\u2206CSMS (\u03b1s (Q2 )) = 1 \u2212\n,\n(15)\n\u2212 1.096\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nMS\n2\n\u2206CN\nS (\u03b1s (Q )) = 1 \u2212\n\nfor Nq = 3 [18]. Estimates exist for the fourth (third)\norder non-singlet (singlet) term [19].\nThe first determination of \u2206\u03a3 was a moment analysis\nof the EMC proton data [20], using Eq. (11) and the moments of the Wilson coefficients in O(\u03b11s ). It resulted in\n\u2206\u03a3 = 0.120\u00b10.094(stat)\u00b10.138(sys), much smaller than\nthe expectation (\u2206\u03a3 \u2248 0.6) [21, 22] from the relativistic constituent quark model. This result caused enormous activity in both experiment and theory. A series\nof high-precision scattering experiments with polarized\nbeams and targets were completed at CERN [23, 24, 25],\nSLAC [26, 27, 28], DESY [29] and continue at CERN [30]\nand JLAB [31]. Such measurements are always restricted\nto certain x and Q2 ranges due to the experimental conditions. However, any determination of \u2206\u03a3 requires an\n'evolution' to a fixed value of Q2 and an extrapolation of\ng1 data to the full x range and substantial uncertainties\nmight arise from the necessary extrapolations x \u2192 0 and\nx \u2192 1. This limitation applies also to recent determinations of \u2206\u03a3 based on NLO fits [32, 33, 34, 35, 36] of\nthe x and Q2 dependence of g1 for proton, deuteron, and\n\nneutron, using Eq. (10) and the corresponding evolution\nequations.\nThis paper reports final results obtained by the HERMES experiment on the structure function g1 for the proton, deuteron, and neutron. The results include an analysis of the proton data collected in 1996, a re-analysis of\n1997 proton data previously published [37], as well as the\nanalysis of the deuteron data collected in the year 2000.\nWhile the accuracy of the HERMES proton data is comparable to that of earlier measurements, the HERMES\ndeuteron data are more precise than all published data.\nBy combining HERMES proton and deuteron data, precise results on the neutron spin structure function g1n are\nobtained.\nFor this analysis, the kinematic range has been extended with respect to the previous proton analysis, to\ninclude the region at low x (0.0041 \u2264 x \u2264 0.0212) with\nlow Q2 . In this region the information available on g1\nwas sparse. As will be discussed in Sect. VI, the first\nmoment \u0393d1 determined from HERMES data appears to\nsaturate for x < 0.04. This observation allows for a determination of a0 with small uncertainties and for a test\nof the Bjorken Sum Rule, as well as scheme-dependent\nestimates of \u2206\u03a3 and the first moments of the flavor separated quark helicity distributions, \u2206u + \u2206\u016b, \u2206d + \u2206d \u0304\nand \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304.\nThe paper is organized as follows: the formalism leading to the extraction of the structure function g1 will\nbe briefly reviewed in Sect. II, Sect. III deals with the\nHERMES experimental arrangement and the data analysis is described in Sect. IV. Final results are presented\nin Sect. V and discussed in Sect. VI.\n\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nIn the one-photon-exchange approximation, the differential cross section for inclusive deep-inelastic scattering\nof polarized charged leptons off polarized nuclear targets\ncan be written [38] as:\nd2 \u03c3(s, S)\n2\u03c0\u03b12 y 2\n=\nL\u03bc\u03bd (s)W\u03bc\u03bd (S) ,\ndx dQ2\nQ6\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the fine-structure constant. As depicted in\nFig. 1 the leptonic tensor L\u03bc\u03bd describes the emission of\na virtual photon at the lepton vertex, and the hadronic\ntensor W\u03bc\u03bd describes the hadron vertex. The main kinematic variables used for the description of deep-inelastic\nscattering are defined in Tab. I. The tensor L\u03bc\u03bd can\nbe calculated precisely in Quantum Electro-Dynamics\n(QED) [15]:\nL\u03bc\u03bd (s) = 2(k\u03bc k\u03bd\u2032 + k\u03bd k\u03bc\u2032 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd (k * k \u2032 \u2212 m2l ))\n+ 2i\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (k \u2212 k \u2032 )\u03b1 s\u03b2 .\n\n(17)\n\nHere the spinor normalization s2 = \u2212m2l is used.

The sensitivity of the cross section to g1 and g2\narises from the product of the anti-symmetric parts of\nthe L\u03bc\u03bd and W\u03bc\u03bd tensors, which is non-zero only when\nboth target and beam are polarized.\nFor a spin-1 target such as the deuteron, the hadronic\ntensor has four additional structure functions arising\nfrom its electric quadrupole structure [41, 42]. Only three\nappear at leading-twist level: b1 , b2 and \u2206. In the scaling\n(Bjorken) limit the structure function b2 is related to b1\nby b2 (x) = 2xb1 (x); \u2206 describes the double helicity-flip\n(virtual) photon-deuteron amplitude [43]. The structure\nfunction b1 appears in a product with the tensor polarization of the target, which can coexist with the vector\npolarization in spin-1 targets. The influence of the tensor polarization on the g1 measurement is discussed in\nSect. IV C. In this analysis the unmeasured function \u2206\nis neglected since its contribution is suppressed for longitudinally polarized targets.\nThe structure function g1 is related directly to the cross\nsection difference:\n\u03c3LL \u2261\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n1 \u21d0\n(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u21d2 ) ,\n2\n\n(19)\n\nlab\n\n\u2248 4EE \u2032 sin2\n\n\u03b8\n2\n\n\u03bd=\n\nP * q lab\n= E \u2212 E\u2032\nM\n\nEnergy of the virtual photon in\nthe target rest frame\n\nx=\n\nQ2\nQ2\n=\n2P * q\n2 M\u03bd\n\nBjorken scaling variable\n\ny=\n\nP *q\n\u03bd\n=\nP *k\nE\n\nSquared invariant mass of the\nW 2 = (P + q)2\n= M 2 + 2M \u03bd \u2212 Q2 photon\u2013nucleon system\n\nwhere longitudinally (L) polarized leptons (\u2192) scatter on\nlongitudinally (L) polarized nuclear targets with polar\u2192 \u2192\nization direction either parallel or anti-parallel (\u21d2, \u21d0)\nto the spin direction of the beam.

The spin structure function g2 (x, Q2 )\ndoes not have any probabilistic interpretation in the\nQPM. It will not be discussed further in this paper, but\nit is taken into account in the extraction of g1 by using a\nparameterization of the published data. The second term\nis small compared to the first. Averaged over all (x, Q2 )\nbins of this analysis it is of order 0.54% for the proton\nand 1.9% for the deuteron. Therefore the existing precision for g2 has only a marginal effect on an extraction of\ng1 .\nFor only the purely technical reason that absolute cross\nsections are difficult to measure, asymmetries are the\nusual direct experimental observable:\nA|| \u2261\n\n\u03c3LL\n,\n\u03c3UU\n\n(21)\n\n\f6\nwhere \u03c3UU is the polarization-averaged cross section2 ,\nwherein the subscript U U indicates that both beam\nand target are unpolarized.

Values of absolute\npolarization-averaged DIS cross sections \u03c3UU are introduced from previous experiments that were designed to\nmeasure them precisely. These cross sections are all that\nis needed to extract the spin structure function g1 at\nthe measured combinations of x and Q2 . They are also\nneeded in the process of correcting the measured asymmetry Am\n|| for higher order QED (radiative) effects to\nobtain the asymmetry A|| at Born level. This is because\nthe polarization-averaged yields must be normalized to\nknown values of \u03c3UU in order to subtract QED radiative\nbackground calculated as absolute cross sections.\nSubstituting \u03c3LL = \u03c3UU A|| into Eq.

A value of \u03c9D = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 is\nused, which covers most of the available estimates [44, 45,\n46, 47, 48]. In this paper the neutron structure function\ng1n is evaluated according to Eq.

The HERMES measurement of g1n off 3 He has\nbeen previously published in [29].\n\n2\n\nIn presenting the extraction of spin observables of interest from\nthe experimental data, we depart from the traditional formalism\nwith the purpose of making a clearer distinction between technical issues and spin physics. In particular, we avoid entanglement\nin a so-called 'depolarization factor' of the crucial spin dependence of the leptonic tensor with one of several parameters used\nto represent previous data for \u03c3U U that are needed to convert\nA|| into the needed \u03c3LL .\n\nTHE EXPERIMENT\n\nThe HERA facility at DESY comprises a proton and\na lepton storage ring. HERMES is a fixed-target experiment using exclusively the lepton ring, which can be filled\nwith either electrons or positrons (only positron data are\nused for this analysis), while the proton beam passes\nthrough the non-instrumented horizontal mid-plane of\nthe spectrometer. Internal to the lepton ring, an openended storage cell is installed that can be fed with either polarized or unpolarized target gas. The three major components to the HERMES experiment (beam, target, spectrometer) are briefly described in the following, while detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere\n([50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]).\n\nA.\n\ny2 2\n4 \u03b3\n2\n\ng1He \u2243 Pn g1n + 2Pp g1p ,\n\nIII.\n\nPolarized HERA Beam\n\nSpin rotators and polarimeters are essential components of the HERA lepton beam. They are described in\ndetail in Refs. [59, 60, 61, 62]. The initially unpolarized\nbeam becomes transversely polarized by an asymmetry\nin the emission of synchrotron radiation associated with a\nspin flip (Sokolov-Ternov mechanism [63]). The beam polarization grows and approaches asymptotically an equilibrium value, with a time constant depending on the\ncharacteristics of the ring, typically over 30-40 minutes.\nThe transverse guide field generates transverse beam polarization in the ring, while spin rotators in front of and\nbehind the experiment provide longitudinal polarization\nat the interaction point and at one of the two beam polarimeters.\nThe two HERA beam polarimeters are based on Compton back-scattering of circularly polarized laser light.\nThe transverse beam polarization at the opposite side of\nthe ring causes an up-down asymmetry in the direction\nof the back-scattered photons. The resulting position\nasymmetry is measured by the top and bottom halves\nof the lead-scintillator sampling calorimeter of the transverse polarimeter [61], with fractional systematic uncertainties of 3.5% (1996-97 data). The longitudinal beam\npolarization in the region of the experiment leads to an\nasymmetry in the energy of the back-scattered Compton\nphotons measured in the NaBi(WO4 )2 crystal calorimeter of the longitudinal polarimeter [59], with fractional\nsystematic uncertainties of 1.6% (2000 data). The average beam polarization was typically larger than 0.5.\nIn order to account for the time dependence of the\nbeam polarization, its continuously monitored values are\nused in the analysis. The average values of the beam polarizations for each year covered in this paper are shown\nin Tab. II. The numbers are weighted by the luminosity\nso that the value near the beginning of each fill dominates.\n\n\f7\nB.\n\nThe HERMES Polarized Gas Target\n\nThe combination of a fixed target with the HERA lepton storage ring requires the employment of a gaseous\ntarget internal to the beam line. This has the advantages of being almost free of dilution (the fraction f of\npolarizable nucleons being close to 1), of providing a high\ndegree of vector polarization (Pz > 0.8), and of being able\nto invert the direction of the spin of the nucleons within\nmilliseconds.\nThe HERMES longitudinally polarized gas target [57],\nschematically shown in Fig. 2, consists of an Atomic\nBeam Source (ABS) [64] which produces a polarized jet\nof atomic hydrogen or deuterium and focuses it into a\nthin-walled storage cell along the beam line [65]. The\natomic gas is produced in a dissociator and is formed\ninto a beam using a cooled nozzle, collimators and a\nseries of differential pumping stations. A succession of\nmagnetic sextupoles and radio-frequency fields are used\nto select (by Stern-Gerlach separation) and exchange (by\nradio-frequency transitions) the atomic hyperfine states\nthat have a given nuclear polarization to be injected into\nthe cell. The storage cell, inside the HERA beam pipe,\nis a windowless 40 cm long elliptical tube, coaxial to the\nbeam, with 75 \u03bcm thick Al walls coated to inhibit surface\nrecombination and depolarization. The use of the storage\ncell technique results in a typical areal density increase of\nabout two orders of magnitude compared to a free jet target. A sample of gas (ca. 5%) diffuses from the middle of\nthe cell into a Breit-Rabi Polarimeter (BRP) [66] which\n\nTABLE II: Average value and uncertainty of the beam polarization for each year of measurements.\nYear\n1996\n1997\n2000\n\nAverage Polarization\n0.528 \u00b1 0.018\n0.531 \u00b1 0.018\n0.533 \u00b1 0.010\ne+ beam\n\nstorage cell\n\nmagnet coils\nstorage cell\n\niron yoke\n\nsextupoles\nRFT\nnozzle\n\nRFT\n\nchopper\n\nchopper\n\nH1\n\nsextupole detector\ndetector\n\nABS\n\nB\n\nTGA\n\nBRP\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic view of the longitudinally polarized target.

A magnet surrounding the storage cell provides a holding field defining the\npolarization axis and prevents spin relaxation via spin\nexchange or wall collisions by effectively decoupling the\nmagnetic moments of electrons and nucleons. A gaseous\nhelium cooling system keeps the cell temperature at the\nlowest value for which atomic recombination and spin relaxation during wall collisions are minimal.\nThe vector polarization Pz is defined as Pz \u2261 (n+ \u2212\n\u2212\nn )/(n+ + n\u2212 ) and Pz \u2261 (n+ \u2212 n\u2212 )/(n+ + n\u2212 + n0 ) for\nspin-1/2 and spin-1 targets, respectively. Here n+ , n\u2212\nand n0 are the atomic populations with positive, negative and zero spin projection on the beam direction. The\nsign of the target polarization is randomly chosen each\n60 s for hydrogen and 90 s for deuterium. The target parameters are measured for each such interval. The rapid\ncycling of the target polarization reduces the systematic\nuncertainty in the measured spin asymmetries related to\nthe stability of the experimental setup. Due to the very\nstable performance of the target operation, luminosityaverage polarization values are used in the analysis.\nHydrogen data\nDuring the years 1996-97 a longitudinally polarized hydrogen target was employed at a nominal temperature\nTcell = 100 K. The average target polarization for the\nyear 1997 reached the value Pz+ = Pz\u2212 = 0.851 \u00b1 0.032;\nthe average target areal density was determined to be\n7.6 * 1013 nucleons/cm2 . The target polarization for the\nyear 1996, which contributes only about 27% to the total statistics, was determined from the normalization of\nthe 1996 inclusive asymmetry to that of 1997. For this\nlimited data-set this method provides a smaller uncertainty on the target polarization w.r.t. the direct measurement. In 1997, a set of data at higher temperature\n(Tcell = 260 K) was collected in order to measure the polarization of the recombined molecules [68], thus reducing the systematic uncertainty on the target polarization\nmeasurement by a factor close to 2.\nDeuterium data\nFrom the end of 1998 till the end of 2000 deuterium\nwas used as target material. The data taken in 1998\nand 1999 have been excluded from the present analysis because of the overwhelming statistics of the 2000\ndata. In the year 2000 a target cell with smaller cross\nsection was installed with reduced nominal temperature\nTcell = 60 K, thus increasing the target density by a factor of 2. The average values of the target vector polarization were Pz+ = 0.851 \u00b1 0.031 and Pz\u2212 = 0.840 \u00b1 0.028.\nThe two polarization values are due to different injection\nefficiencies of the ABS. The average target areal density\nwas determined to be 2.1 * 1014 nucleons/cm2 . In a dedicated running period, about 3.5 million deep-inelastic\nscattering events were taken with tensor polarization, allowing the first measurement ever of the tensor structure\n\n\f8\nTRIGGER HODOSCOPE H1\n\nFIELD CLAMPS\n\nm\nDRIFT CHAMBERS\n\n2\nPRESHOWER (H2)\nDRIFT\nCHAMBERS\n\n1\n\n140 mrad\n\nFC 1/2\nPROP.\nCHAMBERS\n\nLUMINOSITY 27.5 GeV\n\n0\n\nMONITOR\n\nTARGET\nCELL\n\ne+\n\nMC 1-3\n\nHODOSCOPE H0\n\n-1\n\nBC 1/2\n\n140 mrad\nBC 3/4\n\nSTEEL PLATE\n\nCALORIMETER\n\nTRD\n\nRICH\n\n-2\nMAGNET\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 m\n\nFIG. 3: A schematic side view of the HERMES spectrometer.\n\nfunction bd1 and the first assessment of the effect on the\ng1d measurement by the coexistent tensor polarization of\nthe deuteron target (see Sect.

[50]. It constitutes a forward\nspectrometer with multiple tracking stages before and\nafter a 1.5 Tm dipole magnet, and good particle identification (PID) capabilities. A horizontal iron plate shields\nthe HERA beam lines from the dipole field, thus dividing\n\nthe spectrometer in two identical halves, top and bottom.\nThe geometrical acceptance of \u00b1170 mrad horizontally\nand \u00b1(40 \u2212 140) mrad vertically results in detected scattering angles ranging from 40 to 220 mrad.\nIn each spectrometer half, the intersection points of\ncharged particle trajectories with the 36 planes of the\nFront Chambers (FC 1-2) and Back Chambers (BC 1-4)\nare used for track reconstruction in space. These detectors are horizontal-drift chambers with alternating cathode and anode wires between two cathode foils, all operated with the gas mixture Ar:CO2 :CF4 (90:5:5), the\naverage drift velocity being 7 cm/\u03bcs. They are assembled in modules of six layers in three coordinate doublets\n(XX \u2032 , U U \u2032 , and V V \u2032 ), where the primed planes are offset\nby half a cell width to help resolve left-right ambiguities.\nThe cell width is 7 mm for FCs [54], while it is 15 mm\nfor BCs [51] behind the magnet.\nThe proportional wire chambers MC1-3, also shown in\nFig. 3, are not included in the tracking algorithm [50]\nused for this analysis.\nThis tracking algorithm determines partial tracks before (front track) and after the magnet (back track). The\ntrack projections are found in a fast tree search and then\ncombined to determine the particle momentum. The algorithm uses the intersection point of the back track with\nthe magnet mid-plane to refine front tracks. From their\nscattering angles and positions the event vertex is determined, while the back tracks are also used to identify hits\nin the PID detectors. Monte Carlo simulations show that\n\n\f9\n\u2022 the highest momentum lepton in the event originating from the target region is selected,\n\u2022 geometric and kinematic constraints are applied.\nA.\n\nThe kinematic range\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV )\n\nThe kinematic range of the events selected for this\nanalysis is shown in Fig. 4, together with the requirements imposed on the kinematic variables. The aperture of the spectrometer limits the acceptance to scattering angles 0.04 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 0.22 mrad. The constraint\ny > 0.1 is used to exclude regions where the momentum resolution starts to degrade [50]. The constraint\ny \u2264 0.91 discards the low momentum region (E < 2.5\nGeV) where the trigger efficiencies have not yet reached\na momentum plateau. The requirement W 2 > (1.8)2\nGeV2 suppresses the region of baryon resonances.

The resolution for hydrogen was better than for deuterium as\nthe RICH detector installed before the deuterium data\ntaking period introduced some additional material.\nThe scattered positron is identified through a combination of a lead-glass calorimeter, a pre-shower detector, a Transition-Radiation Detector (TRD), and the\n\u010cerenkov detectors. (While the threshold \u010cerenkov was\nused in 1996-97 primarily for pion identification, the\nRing-Imaging \u010cerenkov (RICH) detector [56, 69] was\nused thereafter to identify pions, kaons, and protons.)\nThe Calorimeter [52] is used to suppress hadrons by\na factor of 10 at the trigger level and a factor of 100\nin the off-line analysis, to measure the energy of electrons/positrons and also of photons. Each half consists of\n42x10 blocks of radiation-resistant F101 lead glass [70].\nEach block has a cross section of 9x9 cm2 and 50 cm\ndepth, and is viewed from the back by a photo-multiplier\ntube. The calorimeter's p\nresolution was measured to be\n\u03c3(E)/E[%] = (5.1\u00b11.1)/ E[GeV ]+(2.0\u00b10.5)+(10.0\u00b1\n2.0)/E [52].\nThe scintillator hodoscope H2, consisting of 42 vertical 9.3x91 cm2 'paddles' of 1 cm thickness, forms the\npre-shower detector in combination with two radiation\nlengths of lead preceding it. As pions deposit only about\n2 MeV in H2, as compared to 20-40 MeV for leptons, the\npion contamination can be reduced by more than a factor\nof 10 with 95% efficiency if this detector were used alone.\nThe TRD rejects hadrons by a factor of more than 100\nat 90% electron/positron efficiency, if used alone. A TRD\nhalf comprises six proportional wire chambers to detect\nthe photons from transition radiation in the preceding\nradiator. All TRD proportional chambers use Xe:CH4\n(90:10) gas.\nThe luminosity monitor [55] detects in coincidence\ne+ e\u2212 pairs originating from Bhabha scattering of the\nbeam positrons off electrons from the target atoms, and\nalso \u03b3\u03b3 pairs from e+ e\u2212 annihilations. It consists of\ntwo small calorimeters made of highly radiation resistant\nNaBi(WO4 )2 crystals covering a horizontal acceptance of\n4.6-8.9 mrad. They are mounted to the right and left of\nthe beam pipe, 7.2 m downstream of the target.\n\n-1\n\nx\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4: Kinematic x \u2212 Q2 and x \u2212 y planes covered by this\nanalysis. The symbols represent the average values of (x, Q2 )\n(top panel) and (x, y) (bottom panel) in each bin. Subdivision\nof the x-bins along Q2 is denoted by different symbols (A, B,\nC).\n\n\f10\n0.18 GeV2 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 20 GeV2 , was divided into 19 bins in\nx, guided by the available statistics. Furthermore most xbins are subdivided into up to 3 bins in Q2 , designated A,\nB and C bins. The purpose of this is to allow appropriate\nstatistical weighting of these Q2 bins, thereby exploiting\nthe higher figure of merit at larger Q2 , which is due to\nboth the larger polarization transfer from the incident\nlepton to the virtual photon, and the smaller kinematic\nsmearing between x bins. Logarithmically equidistant\nbin boundaries are used along the x axis in the region\n0.044 < x < 0.66, and along the Q2 axis in the region\nx > 0.06.\n\nThe hadron contamination is defined as the number of\nhadrons with P ID > P IDcut divided by the number of\nidentified leptons, and the lepton efficiency is defined as\nthe number of identified leptons over the total number of\nleptons. The choice P IDcut = 1 used in this analysis optimizes the tradeoff between efficiency and purity in the\nsample. For this choice, hadron contaminations are less\nthan 0.2% over the entire x range, and lepton efficiencies\nlarger than 96%, assuming that the detector responses\nare uncorrelated.\n\nC.\nB.\n\nParticle Identification\n\nThe lepton (positron and electron) identification is\nachieved with a probability analysis based on the responses of the TRD, the pre-shower detector, the\nCalorimeter, and the \u010cerenkov detectors, described in\nSect. III C.\nThe requirement used to identify a lepton is:\nP ID = log10\n\nP (l|R, p, \u03b8)\n> P IDcut ,\nP (h|R, p, \u03b8)\n\n(25)\n\nwhere P (l(h)|R, p, \u03b8) is the conditional probability that\nthe particle is a lepton l or a hadron h, given the combined response set R from all the Particle Identification\ndetectors, the momentum p, and the scattering angle \u03b8.\nBayes' theorem relates P (l(h)|R, p, \u03b8) to the probability\nP (l(h)|p, \u03b8) that a particle with momentum p, scattered\nat polar angle \u03b8, is a lepton (hadron), and the probability P (R|l(h), p) that a lepton (hadron) with momentum\np causes the combined signal R. The P ID can be rewritten as:\nP (R|l, p) P (l|p, \u03b8)\n*\n= P ID\u2032 \u2212log10 \u03a6(p, \u03b8).\nP (R|h, p) P (h|p, \u03b8)\n(26)\nHere \u03a6(p, \u03b8) is the ratio between the hadron and lepton\nfluxes impinging onto the detector:\nP ID = log10\n\n\u03a6(p, \u03b8) =\n\nP (h|p, \u03b8)\n.\nP (l|p, \u03b8)\n\n(27)\n\nThe quantity P ID\u2032 is defined combining the responses\nRD of each detector D used for particle identification:\nP ID\u2032 = log10\n\nY PD (RD |l, p)\n.\nPD (RD |h, p)\n\n(28)\n\nD\n\nUnder the approximation that the responses of the particle identification detectors are uncorrelated, the distribution PD (RD |l(h), p) of detector D, i.e. the typical detector response for leptons (hadrons), can be measured\nby placing very restrictive cuts on the response of the\nother PID detectors to isolate a very clean sample of a\nparticular particle type [71].\n\nInclusive Asymmetries\n\nThe yield averaged over target polarization state is:\nZ\nN (x, Q2 ) = \u03c3UU (x, Q2 ) dt a(x, Q2 ) \u03b5(t, x, Q2 )\u03c4 (t)L(t),\n\n(29)\nwhere t is time and \u03c4 (t) is the live-time factor, which is\ntypically 0.97 for this analysis, \u03c3UU is the polarizationaveraged cross section, a(x, Q2 ) is the detector acceptance, \u03b5(t, x, Q2 ) is the total detection efficiency (tracking and trigger) and L(t) is the luminosity. In the case\nof double-polarized scattering this relation becomes:\n\u2192 \u2192\n\nN \u21d2(\u21d0) (x, Q2 ) = a(x, Q2 ) \u03c3UU (x, Q2 )\n\u2192 \u2192\n\nZ\n\ndt \u03b5(t, x, Q2 )\n\n\u00d7 \u03c4 (t)L\u21d2(\u21d0) (t)[1 + (\u2212)|PB (t)Pz (t)| A|| (x, Q2 )] ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere PB and Pz are the beam and target polarizations.\nFor a spin-1 target Eq. (30) contains an additional term\ndepending on the tensor polarization, and this case will\nbe treated later in this section.\nThe measured asymmetry Am\n|| is therefore:\n\u2192 R\n\u2192\n\u2192 R\n\u2192\nN \u21d2 dt \u03b5\u03c4 L\u21d0 \u2212 N \u21d0 dt \u03b5\u03c4 L\u21d2\n,\nR\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nN \u21d2 dt \u03b5\u03c4 L\u21d0 PB Pz + N \u21d0 dt \u03b5\u03c4 L\u21d2 PB Pz\n(31)\nwhere the dependences on x, Q2 and t have been suppressed for simplicity. Since the target changes every\n60 s (90 s) for hydrogen (deuterium) between the two\npolarization states, any variation in the efficiencies can\nbe safely assumed to be the same in the anti-aligned and\naligned configurations of beam and target polarizations,\nimplying that they cancel in the ratio if the measurement\nis fully differential in the kinematics. In a simulation\nmade with Monte Carlo data covering a 4\u03c0 acceptance,\nit has been confirmed that the asymmetry is not significantly affected by the limited acceptance or non-uniform\nefficiency of the detector.\nThe measured asymmetry Am\n|| is obtained from the\nnumber of events in the two polarization states as:\n\nAm\n|| =\n\n\u2192 R\n\n2\nAm\n|| (x, Q )\n\n=\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\nN \u21d0 (x, Q2 ) L\u21d2 \u2212 N \u21d2 (x, Q2 ) L\u21d0\n\u21d0\n\u21d2\n2\nN \u21d0 (x, Q2 ) L\u21d2\nP + N (x, Q ) LP\n\n, (32)\n\n\f11\n\u2192 \u2192\n\n\u21d2(\u21d0)\n\n\u2192 \u2192\n\nwhere the luminosities L\u21d2(\u21d0) and LP\nare defined as:\nZ\n\u2192 \u2192\n\u2192 \u2192\nL\u21d2(\u21d0) =\ndt L\u21d2(\u21d0) (t) \u03c4 (t),\nZ\n\u2192 \u2192\n\u2192 \u2192\n\u21d2(\u21d0)\nLP\n=\ndt L\u21d2(\u21d0) (t) |PB (t)Pz (t)| \u03c4 (t). (33)\nThe asymmetries are ratios of yields integrated over\nbin widths. As the yields depend nonlinearly on x and\nQ2 , a question arises about the effect of the nonzero\nbin widths. Using parameterizations for unpolarized and\nspin structure functions, it was confirmed that there is\nno significant difference between values of A|| (xi ) calculated from the yields integrated over the experimental geometric acceptance for Q2 , and A|| (xi , hQ2 ii ) evaluated\nat hQ2 ii .\nThe various stages of the analysis are now introduced\nin the order in which they are applied.\nCharge symmetric background\nThe observed event sample is contaminated by background from charge symmetric (CS) processes, such as\nmeson Dalitz decays or photon conversions into e+ e\u2212\npairs. Since these e+ and e\u2212 originate from secondary\nprocesses, they typically have lower momenta and are\nthus concentrated at high y. A correction for this background is applied in each kinematic bin by subtracting\nthe number of leptons with the charge opposite to that\nof the beam particle. The charge symmetric background\nreaches up to 25% at low x and becomes negligible at\nlarge values of x, as shown in Fig. 5.\nHadron contamination\nThe hadron contamination is less than 0.2% over the entire x range, so no correction is required.\n\nCS (%)\n\nFinal data sample\n\nAfter data selection as discussed above, the numbers of\nevents available for asymmetry analyses on proton and\ndeuteron are shown in Tabs.

Subdivisions A, B, and C are those defined in Fig. 4.\n\nTop-bottom asymmetries\nSince the HERMES detector consists of two symmetric\nhalves, they are considered as two separate and independent spectrometers, with individual application of data\nquality criteria. The asymmetry A|| is evaluated separately for the top and bottom halves. This procedure allows polarization-independent systematic effects present\n\n\f12\n\nStability checks\nThe asymmetries measured on proton and deuteron have\nbeen calculated as functions of time, beam current, target vertex and azimuthal angle, searching for possible\nsystematic deviations from the average value. No significant effect was observed.\nGeometrical constraints were also investigated, varying\nthe target vertex selection that ensures that the event\noriginated inside the target, and the polar angle constraint which limits the angular acceptance. Again, no\neffects on the asymmetry were observed.\nThe helicity of the positron beam was reversed twice\n(six times) during the running periods of hydrogen (deuterium) measurement. The asymmetry A|| was found to\nbe consistent within statistical uncertainties when calculated separately for the two beam helicities.\nUnfolding of Radiative and Instrumental Smearing\nRadiative effects include vertex corrections to the QED\nhard scattering amplitude, and kinematic migration of\nDIS events due to radiation of real photons by the lepton. Because only a fraction of the photons that may\nbe radiated by the initial or final state lepton can be detected in the HERMES spectrometer, no attempt is made\nto identify and reject such radiative events. Therefore,\nradiative corrections must be applied to the experimentally observed asymmetries Am\n|| . These asymmetries are\nalso affected by instrumental smearing due to multiple\nscattering in target and detector material and external\nbremsstrahlung. As illustrated in Fig. 6, a significant\npart of the events are not reconstructed inside the bin\nto which they belong according to their kinematics at\nthe Born level. Events migrating into other mostly adjacent bins introduce a systematic correlation between\ndata points and may affect the measured asymmetry.\nAn incident positron can also radiate an energetic\nreal photon while scattering elastically on a proton\nor deuteron, or quasi-elastically on a nucleon in the\ndeuteron. The final kinematics of these Bethe-Heitler\n(B-H) events can be such that they pass the DIS analysis\ncuts. Such events represent a background to the usual\nDIS events, which has to be effectively subtracted.\nIn order to correct for these effects and retrieve the\nBorn asymmetries, an unfolding algorithm has been applied (see App. A). The radiative and detector-smearing\neffects are simulated in a Monte Carlo model yielding\ndetailed information about how events migrate from one\nkinematic bin to another. The background arising from\nB-H events is included in the simulation. The Monte\nCarlo data samples used in this analysis have a statistical accuracy three times better than that of the measured\ndata.\nSchematically, in the unfolding algorithm the vector of\n\nBorn asymmetries A|| is obtained from the vector of measured asymmetries Am\n|| by applying a matrix that corrects\nfor the smearing, while effectively subtracting the radiative background. The expressions relating the measured\nand Born asymmetries are given in Eqs. (A28\u2013A29). The\nunfolding corrections depend on the Monte Carlo models for background, detector behavior and asymmetries\noutside the measured region, and on the model for the\npolarization-averaged cross section. They do not depend on any model for the asymmetry in the measured\nregion. Before unfolding, the experimental asymmetry\ndata points contain events which originate from other\nbins. After unfolding, the data points are statistically\ncorrelated but systematic correlations due to kinematic\nsmearing have been removed, resulting in a resolution\nin x or Q2 of a single-bin width. This is a large improvement over the resolution function shown in Fig. 6,\nwhich would still apply if a traditional 'iterative' method\nof applying radiative corrections were employed as in\nRefs. [23, 26, 27, 72, 73]. The unfolding algorithm provides the correlation matrix that should be used to calculate the statistical uncertainties on quantities obtained\nfrom the Born asymmetry, such as the weighted average\nof g1 over Q2 bins or the integrals of g1 over the measured\nrange: treating the uncertainties as uncorrelated would\nresult in overestimating the uncertainty.\nIn the case of B-H background events, the radiated\nphoton has a significant probability of hitting the detector frames close to the beam line in the front region\nof the HERMES detector. As a consequence, an extensive electromagnetic shower is produced causing a very\nhigh hit multiplicity in the tracking detectors, making\nthe track reconstruction impossible [74]. This detector\ninefficiency for B-H events was taken into account in order to not over-correct for radiative processes that are\nnot observed in the spectrometer . The efficiency \u03b5e.m.\nfor the detection of B-H events was extracted with a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation that includes a complete\n5000\n\narbitrary units\n\nin each detector half to cancel independently. The two\nasymmetries are tested to be consistent within their statistical uncertainties, and the final asymmetry is obtained\nas the weighted average of the two.\n\n4500\n4000\n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 6: The distribution of events originating from the arbitrarily selected x-bin shown as a shaded area, from a simulation of QED radiative effects and detector smearing, using a\nproton target.

In this work, the tensor polarization is large\nbecause the vector polarization could be maximized by\nminimizing the n0 population (see Sec. III B), resulting\n\nThere do exist parameterizations of F2 based on all available cross section data, but they were fitted to values\nof F2 that were extracted from various data sets using\ndifferent values or assumptions for R, the ratio of longitudinal to transverse virtual-photon cross sections. The\nvalues of g1 extracted at the measured values of Q2 do\nnot depend on F2 and R individually, but only on how\nfaithfully the available combinations of F2 and R param-\n\n\f14\neterizations represent experimental knowledge of \u03c3UU .3\nIn the case of the proton, the parameterizations\nALLM97 [76] and R1990 [77] are used for F2 and R,\nrespectively. The parameterization R1990 is valid only\nfor Q2 > 0.3 GeV2 . Below this value R was linearly\nextrapolated to zero to account for the fact that for real\nphotons R = 0. In the case of the deuteron, the NMC parameterization of the measured ratio F2n /F2p [78] is used\nin conjunction with the ALLM97 parameterization for\nF2p to calculate F2d . The required values of g2 are computed from a parameterization of all available proton and\ndeuteron data [79, 80, 81, 82, 83].\nThe results for g1 in Tab. XIV in the 45 individual\nkinematic bins of Fig. 4 are considered to be the primary\nresult of this work, in that the only previously published\ninformation used in their extraction is the spin-averaged\nDIS cross section \u03c3UU , and small corrections involving g2 .\nFor both the convenient presentation and interpretation\nof these results, some ansatz must be adopted to 'evolve'\nthese results in Q2 , as it is impossible to use QCD to\nevolve individual values of structure functions at diverse\nvalues of x. Two degrees of 'evolution' are involved. For\nthe convenient presentation of the x dependence of g1 ,\nits values in the two or three Q2 bins that may be associated with each xi bin must be evolved to their mean hQ2 ii\nand then averaged. Also, in order to compute moments\nof g1 , the measurements in the 45 (xi , Q2i ) bins must be\nbrought to a common Q20 . One previously used ansatz\nis to assume that the structure function ratio g1 /F1 is\nindependent of Q2 . This is usually justified by the observation that the non-singlet evolution kernel is the same\nfor g1 and F1 , and the ansatz cannot be excluded by the\nlimited available data set. However, the singlet evolution\nkernels are different, and anyway both kernels operate on\ndifferent initial x distributions. Hence this ansatz seems\narbitrary, and also precludes the assignment of an appropriate uncertainty to the evolution that is based on\nhow well it is constrained by QCD together with existing\ndata. In another approach, used in this work, the primary g1 values are 'evolved' by using an NLO QCD fit\nto all available g1 data, assuming that the difference between g1 (xi , Q2i ) and g1 (xi , Q20 ) is the same as obtained\nin the QCD fit:\ng1 (xi , Q2i ) \u2212 g1 (xi , Q20 ) = g1f it (xi , Q2i ) \u2212 g1f it (xi , Q20 ) .\n(38)\nThe QCD fit used here is described in detail in\nRef. [36]. It was extended to include the present g1p,d\ndata, as well as the new data of Refs. [30] and [31]. The\nuncertainty due to the evolution of g1 was propagated\nfrom the statistical and recently implemented systematic\n\n3\n\nAs such a combination of parameterizations of F2 and R should\nbe considered in this context as a single parameterization of \u03c3U U\nthat must be self-consistent, it might be misleading for F2 or R\nto appear individually in the formalism leading to the extraction\nof g1 .\n\nuncertainties in the fit parameters to the quantities appearing in Eq. (38).\n\nB.\n\nStatistical Uncertainties\n\nThe asymmetry values obtained after unfolding of radiative and smearing effects are statistically correlated\nbetween kinematic bins. Contributions to cov(A|| ) from\nthe finite statistics of the Monte Carlo data sample are\ntypically one order of magnitude smaller than those of the\nexperimental covariance matrix. The (statistics-based)\ncovariance of A|| originating from the unfolding and the\none from the finite statistics of the Monte Carlo are\nsummed; the result is called statistical covariance hereafter.\nEq. (22) implies that the covariance matrix for g1 is\ngiven by:\ncov (g1 )lm = Cl Cm cov(A|| )lm ,\nCi \u2261\n\n1\n1\u2212\n\nyi\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nyi2\n4\n\nQ4i d2\u03c3UU (xi , Q2i )\n(39)\n2\ndx dQ2\n\u03b3 2 8\u03c0\u03b1 yi\ni\n\nwhere the subscripted kinematic quantities correspond to\nthe average x and Q2 values of the kinematic bins.\n\nC.\n\nSystematic Uncertainties\n\nThe systematic uncertainties originate from i) the experiment (beam and target polarizations, PID, misalignment of the detector) and ii) the parameterizations (g2 ,\nF2 , R, Adzz , \u03c9D ). The various contributions to the\nsystematic uncertainty were added quadratically. For\nQ2 \u2265 1 GeV2 they are given in Tab. VII, where each\nvalue represents an average over the measured x range.\ni) Experimental Sources\nPolarizations\nThe uncertainties on beam and target polarization values\n(see Tabs. II and III) are the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties in this measurement. The polarization\nvalues are varied within their uncertainties and the corresponding change in the central value of A|| is assigned\nas its systematic uncertainty, which is then propagated\nto g1 .\nParticle identification\nThe hadron contamination in the DIS lepton sample, is\nless than 0.2% leading to a negligible contribution to the\nsystematic uncertainty.\nDetector Misalignment\nStudies have shown that the two halves of the HERMES\ndetector are not perfectly aligned symmetrically to the\nbeam axis. As a conservative approach, a Monte Carlo\n\n\f15\nsimulation using a misaligned detector geometry is compared to one with perfect alignment, separately for each\ntarget and detector half. A contribution to the systematic uncertainty of the final unfolded asymmetry is assigned as the difference in the central values of the respective reconstructed Monte Carlo asymmetries.\nii) Input parameterizations\nThe parameterizations enter at two different stages of\nthe analysis: unfolding and extraction. The unfolding\nalgorithm does not involve any model of the asymmetries\nwithin the acceptance. Nevertheless a model dependence\ncan arise from the description outside the acceptance.\nThe comparison of different models for both the polarized\nand unpolarized Born cross sections shows no significant\ndeviations in the unfolded Born asymmetry A|| within\nthe statistical accuracy of the Monte Carlo test samples\nused, which is about three times better than that of the\ndata sample.\nWhile calculating g1 from the Born asymmetry A|| according to Eq. (22), and 'evolving' the values of g1 to\na common value of Q2 , non-negligible systematic uncertainties occur due to various input parameterizations of\ng2 , F2 , R, Adzz and \u03c9D .\nStructure function g2\nThe systematic uncertainty due to g2p,d is obtained as\nthe effect on the results of its variation over the range\ncorresponding to the covariance matrix from the fit to\nthe world data for g2 .\nCross section \u03c3UU\nThe systematic uncertainty due to the employed combination of F2p,d and R receives contributions as follows:\n(a) those intrinsic to the original cross section measurements, (b) from model dependence of the parameterizations, and (c) from inconsistencies between the R values from its parameterization and the R values originally\nused to extract F2 from the \u03c3UU data. In an attempt\nto account for all of these contributions in a conservative\nmanner, the systematic uncertainty in \u03c3UU was taken to\nbe the sum in quadrature of the difference between the\nresults using the ALLM and SMC parameterizations for\nF2 , accounting for contribution (b) above, and half of the\ndifference between the results using the upper and lower\nerror bands in the SMC parameterization, approximately\naccounting for (a) and (c)4 .\nTensor asymmetry Adzz\nThe contribution from the uncertainty on the published\n\n4\n\nThe SMC parameterization was not adopted for the central values of this analysis because of an apparent anomaly in its shape\nat x > 0.6.

[25], there is a typographic error in\na parameter for the lower error band, but this error does not\nappear in the related thesis [84] and the SMC web page.\n\nvalue of Adzz [75] is negligible, but is nevertheless included\nin the systematic uncertainty.\nD-wave admixture \u03c9D\nThe limiting values of \u03c9D = 0.05\u00b10.01 are used to determine the \u03c9D contribution to the systematic uncertainty\nof g1n and of the non-singlet structure function g1N S .\n'Evolution' to a common value of Q2\nThe uncertainties of the NLO QCD fit of all available\ndata that is used to 'evolve' the g1 values of the present\nwork are propagated through both the fit and the 'evolution', accounting for correlations. These uncertainties\ninclude experimental statistical and systematic as well as\n'theoretical' uncertainties influencing the fit. The resulting total 'evolution' uncertainty contributions are presented separately in the tables of g1 values in either 19\nor 15 x-bins, and also with the value of each reported\nmoment.\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS\n\nBorn asymmetries and uncertainty correlations\n\nFor the 45 (x, Q2 ) bins defined in Fig. 4, the measured and Born asymmetries Am\n|| and A|| are listed in\nTabs. XI and XII for the proton and the deuteron, together with statistical and systematic uncertainties. The\nBorn asymmetries A|| vary, for fixed values of x, substantially with Q2 . (For more details see Fig. 18 in the\nappendix.) This reflects the fact that the polarization of\nthe virtual photon, probing the helicity-dependent quark\nnumber densities in the nucleon as discussed in the Introduction, is smaller than the polarization of the incident\nlepton and dependent on the lepton kinematics [38]. At\na given value of x, the polarisation transfer is smaller at\nlow values of y, i.e., at low Q2 . This introduces an inflation of the statistical uncertainty in the corresponding\nkinematic bins, when extracting g1 (see Eq. (22)) and A1\n(see Sec. VI B).\nComparing in Fig. 18 the statistical uncertainties of\nAm\n|| and A|| at each x, it is clearly seen that the correction for smearing and radiative background introduces a\nconsiderable uncertainty inflation, especially in the lowest Q2 bins at a given value of x. At low x, this is due to\nthe subtraction of radiative background, while at larger x\nthe uncertainty inflation arises from a substantial instrumental and radiative smearing, which results in considerable bin-to-bin correlations. Note that the statistical\nuncertainties quoted in Tabs. XI and XII and shown in\nFig. 18 correspond only to the diagonal elements of the\ncovariance matrix. Especially at low Q2 the non-diagonal\nelements are large, as can be seen in the correlation matrices listed for the 45 (x,Q2 ) bins in Tabs.

The area of the symbols\nrepresents the size of the correlation.\n\nand shown in Fig. 8 for the proton5 .\nB.\n\nVirtual-photon asymmetry\n\nThe virtual-photon asymmetry A1 is directly related to\nthe photon-nucleon absorption cross sections and hence\nto the structure functions g1 , g2 and F1 :\nA1 =\n\n\u03c31/2 \u2212 \u03c33/2\ng1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 g2\n=\n\u03c31/2 + \u03c33/2\nF1\n\n.\n\n(40)\n\nHere \u03c31/2 and \u03c33/2 are the virtual-photon absorption\ncross sections when the projection of the total angular\nmomentum of the photon-nucleon system along the incident photon direction is 1/2 or 3/2, respectively.\nThe virtual-photon asymmetry A1 is obtained from the\nBorn asymmetry A|| according to Eq. (22) and Eq. (40),\nby using values of \u03c3UU and F1 calculated in terms of the\navailable F2 and R parameterizations, i.e., from Eq. (37)\nand\nF1 =\n\n(1 + \u03b3 2 )F2\n2x(1 + R)\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nand by using a parameterization for g2 obtained from fits\nto all available proton and deuteron data [79, 80, 81, 82,\n\n5\n\n85]. The systematic uncertainties on the virtual-photon\nasymmetry A1 are determined analogously to the case of\ng1 described in Sec. V C, taking into account any correlation between different systematic sources. The results\nare listed for the 45 (x, Q2 ) bins together with their statistical and systematic uncertainties in Tab. XIII for the\nproton and the deuteron.\nThe asymmetries Ap,d\nprovide a convenient way of\n1\ncomparing the precision of various experiments, as most\nof the dependence of A|| on Q2 due to the polarization\ntransfer from the lepton to the virtual photon is cancelled. However, a substantial additional contribution to\nthe systematic uncertainty of A1 due to the poor knowledge of R in the extraction of F1 from measured values\nof \u03c3UU and R is unavoidable. The required values of R\nas well as their uncertainties were computed using the\nR1990 parameterization [77].\nThe values from the present work, averaged over the\ncorresponding Q2 bins, are shown in Fig. 9 as a function\nof x and are compared to the world data in the top (middle) panel of Fig. 10 for the proton (deuteron). Note that\nthe low-x data points of HERMES (x < 0.03) and SMC\n(x < 0.003) are measured at hQ2 i < 1 GeV2 .\nIn the case of the proton, the accuracy of the HERMES measurement is comparable to the most precise\nmeasurements at SLAC (E143 [26], E155 [28]) and at\nCERN (SMC [25]). The HERMES measurement extends\nto lower values in x than the SLAC data points, into a\nregion covered up to now by SMC data only, although at\nhigher values of Q2 . In the case of the deuteron, HERMES data provide the most precise determination of the\nasymmetry Ad1 . The available world data from previous\nmeasurements [23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 86] are considerably\nless accurate than in case of the proton.\nThe asymmetries rise smoothly from zero with increasing x. For x \u2192 1, Ap1 becomes of order unity (i.e. the\nquark carrying most of the nucleon's momentum is also\ncarrying most of its spin). For the deuteron, the asymmetry for x above 0.01 appears to be smaller than that\nof the proton.\nApart from the similar general trend, the asymmetries\nA1 for proton and deuteron are rather different in their x\ndependence and magnitude. The ratio Ad1 /Ap1 is smaller\nthan 0.5 over the measured x range, indicating a negative contribution to Ad1 from the neutron. HERMES\ndata at low Q2 indicate that Ap1 is compatible with zero\nwithin the statistical uncertainties below x = 0.01 while\nAd1 vanishes already below x = 0.05.\n\nThe correlation matrix is related to the covariance matrix\nthrough the statistical uncertanties \u03c3i and \u03c3j : cov(i, j) =\n\u03c3i \u03c3j corr(i, j).\n\nC.\n\nStructure functions g1\n\na. Proton and Deuteron. The primary values for the\nstructure functions g1 for both the proton and deuteron\nare given in Tab. XIV for all of the 45 bins shown in\nFig. 4.

Bands represent systematic uncertainties. Deuteron data points have\nbeen slightly shifted in x for visual purposes.\n\nwere evolved to a common value of Q2 , as described in\nsect. V A, and averaged. The results are shown in 19\nx-bins in Fig. 11, together with all previously published\ndata. Alternatively, the functions xg1p and xg1d are shown\nin Fig. 12, and compared to the previously published data\nin Fig. 13.\nThe numerical values for g1p,d are given in Tab. XVIII\nand the correlation matrices are in Tab. XIX for the proton and in Tab. XX for the deuteron. When events are\nselected subject to Q2 > 1 GeV2 , only 15 x-bins remain\n(see e.g. Fig. 4). The corresponding structure functions\nand correlation matrices are given in Tabs. XXI, XXIII,\nand XXIV. In the case of the proton, the central values\nof the SMC data points are larger than those of HERMES, in the low-x region. This reflects the difference\nin hQ2 i values between the two experiments, and is expected from the Q2 evolution of g1 .\nIn the case of the deuteron, the HERMES data are\ncompatible with zero for x < 0.04. In this region the\nSMC data favor negative values for g1d while the COMPASS results [30] are also consistent with zero.\nb. Neutron. The neutron structure function g1n is\nextracted from g1p and g1d using Eq. (23). Other nuclear\neffects like shadowing and Fermi motion of the nucleons\nin the deuteron are neglected.\nIn Fig. 14 (top panel), results on g1n (x), extracted from\np\ng1 and g1d , are shown for HERMES in comparison to the\nworld data. As can be seen from the lower panel of the\nfigure, the average Q2 values of HERMES and SLAC\nmeasurements are similar, while those of SMC are higher\nby one order of magnitude at a given x. Compared to previous data, the HERMES measurement restricts g1n (x)\n\nnow very well. The structure function g1n is negative\neverywhere, except for the very high x region, where it\nbecomes slightly positive. For decreasing x values below\nabout 0.03, g1n appears to gradually approach zero from\nbelow, complementary to the behavior of g1p . While this\nbehaviour is based on data with Q2 \u2264 1 GeV2 , it differs\nfrom the strong decrease of g1n (x) for x \u2192 0 that was\npreviously conjectured on the basis of the E154 measurement on 3 He [73], and also on SMC data [25], both with\nQ2 \u2265 1 GeV2 as shown in Fig. 14.\nFor completeness, the HERMES results on the x dependence of xg1n are shown in Fig. 15 (top panel), compared to the world data. Tabs. XXV, XXVI and XXVII\nshow the results for g1n in 45 bins, 19 x-bins (obtained after averaging over Q2 ), and in 15 x-bins (obtained after\napplying a Q2 > 1 GeV2 cut to data and then averaging\nin Q2 ).\nc. Non-singlet. The non-singlet spin structure function g1N S (x, Q2 ) is defined as:\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng1d\np\np\nn\nNS\n.\n(42)\ng1 \u2261 g1 \u2212 g1 = 2 g1 \u2212\n1 \u2212 32 \u03c9D\nIn Fig. 15 (bottom panel), the x dependence of xg1N S as\nmeasured by HERMES is shown in comparison with data\nfrom E143, E155 and SMC. The non-singlet structure\nfunction shows a behavior similar to that of the deuteron\nand neutron, which was discussed above: the HERMES\ndata constrain the x dependence of xg1N S much better\nthan earlier measurements; the above-mentioned difference between the HERMES and SMC deuteron data for\nx < 0.03 is reflected also in g1N S .\nD.\n\nIntegrals of g1\n\nImportant information about the spin structure of the\nnucleon can be obtained from the first moment of g1 , in\nparticular when combining results on proton, deuteron\nand neutron. Experimentally, only a limited range in x\nis accessible. The integrals for proton and deuteron over\na certain x range and at a given Q20 are obtained as:\nX g1 (hxii , Q2 ) Z xi+1\n0\ne 1 (Q2 ) =\n\u0393\ndx g1f it (x, Q20 ), (43)\n0\nf it\n2)\ng\n(hxi\n,\nQ\nxi\ni\n1\n0\ni\n\nwhere hxii are the average values of x in x-bin i with\nboundaries xi and xi+1 ; the integral of g1f it accounts for\nthe non-linear x-dependence of g1 . The integrals for g1n\nand g1N S are obtained by linearly combining the ones for\nproton and deuteron.\nThe statistical uncertainty is calculated as:\nZ xj+1\nX Z xi+1\nf it\n2\n2\ndx g1f it (x, Q20 )\ndx g1 (x, Q0 )\n\u03c3\u0393e =\n1\n\nij\n\n\u00d7\n\nxj\n\nxi\n\ncov (g1 )ij\n\ng1f it (hxii , Q20 )\n\ng1f it (hxij , Q20 )\n\n.\n\n(44)\n\n\fAp1\n\n18\n\n1\n\nHERMES (\u3008Q \u3009< 1 GeV )\n2\n\n2\n\nHERMES (\u3008Q \u3009> 1 GeV )\n2\n\n0.75\n\n2\n\nE 143\n2\n\nE 155 (Q -averaged by HERMES)\n0.5\n\nSMC\n2\n\nSMC (low x - low Q )\n0.25\n\nCOMPASS\n\nAd1\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n\u3008Q \u3009(GeV )\n\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n1\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 10: HERMES results on Ap1 and Ad1 vs x, shown on separate panels, compared to data from SMC [23, 25, 86], E143 [26],\nE155 [28], and COMPASS [30].

The correlations between systematic un-\n\ncertainties of g1p and g1d were taken into account in the\ncalculation of the systematic uncertainty for g1n and g1N S .\nThe integrals for g1p , g1d , g1n , and g1N S , calculated at\n2\nQ0 = 2.5 and 5 GeV2 , are given in Tab. VI together\nwith the statistical, systematic and evolution uncertainties. They are shown for the x range 0.021 \u2264 x \u2264 0.9,\ncorresponding to the event selection Q2 \u2265 1 GeV2 . (For\nx > 0.0568 the integrals over the regions A, B and C in\nFig. 4 were calculated separately, found to be consistent,\nand then averaged.) The precision of the integrals given\nin Tab. VI is less affected by the unfolding procedure\nsince all inter-bin correlations from the unfolding procedure are taken into account. The statistical uncertainty\nis smaller by about 25% compared to the case when only\ndiagonal elements of the covariance matrices are considered. Note that the error bars displayed in Figs. 11 to\n15 are derived only from the diagonal elements of the\ncovariance matrix, and the data points are statistically\ncorrelated. The individual contributions to the systematic uncertainties are displayed in Tab. VII. The systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty on the\npolarization measurements.\nA comparison of the integrals over the common measured x range shows agreement with E143, as seen in\nTab. VIII. Comparisons with E155, SMC and E142 also\nshow good agreement within uncertainties. SMC and\nE143 used the hypothesis that g1 /F1 is independent of\nQ2 to perform the evolution to a common Q2 , while E142\nused the hypothesis of Q2 -independence of A1 and E155\nused QCD fits.

Hence,\nin the remaining discussion it will be assumed that the\ndeuteron first moment g1d saturates for x < 0.04. Under\nthis assumption, conclusions can be drawn on the values\nof the singlet axial charge a0 and the first moment of\nthe singlet quark helicity distribution \u2206\u03a3 as well as on\nthe strange-quark helicity distribution \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304.

An unambiguous test of\nthe Bjorken Sum Rule requires the measurement of both\nthe proton and the deuteron (neutron) integrals over the\nwhole x-range. However, the proton integral does not yet\nsaturate in the measured region, as discussed above, and\ntherefore some uncertainty remains due to the required\nextrapolation into the unmeasured small-x region.\nThe HERMES integral for the non-singlet distribution\n(Eq. 42) in the range 0.021 < x < 1 has a value of\n0.1484 \u00b1 0.0055(stat.) \u00b1 0.0142(exp.) \u00b1 0.0055(param.) \u00b1\n0.0049(evol.).\nThis partial moment is significantly\nsmaller than the value for the Bjorken Sum, given for various orders in Table IX, presumably because of the contribution to the proton integral from the unmeasured region\nat small x. Assuming the validity of the Bjorken Sum\nRule and ignoring possible higher-twist terms [88], the\ncontribution from the unmeasured region 0 < x < 0.021\nto \u0393p1 has been evaluated as the difference between the\nep\ninferred value \u0393p1 (inferred) and the measured value \u0393\n1\nin LO to NNNLO. Its central value ranges from 0.0316\nin LO to 0.0169 in NNNLO (see Table IX). The NLO\nvalue is in good agreement with earlier estimates based\non QCD fits [89].\n\n\f23\nTABLE VIII: Comparisons of g1 integrals over different measured x ranges from this experiment (including the SIDIS measurement [1] and the measurement of g1n from a 3 He target [29]) and SMC [25], EMC [87], E143 [26], E155 [27], E142 [72],\nand E154 [73].

This is because the magnitude\nof \u0393d1 is only about 30% of that of \u0393p1 , so that a similar\nscale uncertainty produces a correspondingly smaller absolute uncertainty in \u0393d1 , and as a consequence also in a0 .\nThis advantage of deuterium can be expected to be also\nreflected in the impact of such data on the precision of\nglobal QCD fits.\nThe interpretation of quark distributions and their moments extracted in NLO is subject to some ambiguity\ndue to their scheme dependence. Nevertheless some conclusions can be drawn, especially for the sake of comparison to earlier results, if one stays within the M S\nscheme. In this scheme a0 can be identified with \u2206\u03a3:\nMS\n \u0304 + (\u2206s + \u2206s\u0304). The\na0 = \u2206\u03a3 = (\u2206u + \u2206\u016b) + (\u2206d + \u2206d)\n2\nvalue obtained for \u2206\u03a3(Q0 = 5 GeV2 ) is compared with\nother results from both experimental analyses and QCD\nfits in Tab. XXVIII. The HERMES value obtained from\ne d is in good agreement with the earlier E143 result [26]\n\u0393\n1\non the same target at Q2 = 3 GeV2 , but less so with the\nSMC result [25] at Q2 = 10 GeV2 . The HERMES value\nrepresents about 55% of the relativistic QPM expectation of 0.6. The HERMES data therefore suggest that\nthe quark helicities contribute a substantial fraction to\nthe nucleon helicity, but there is still need for a considerable contribution from gluons and/or orbital angular\nmomenta.\nFrom Tab. XXVIII it can be seen that, among results\nfor \u2206\u03a3 extracted from the data of individual experiments, those using estimates of the contribution from\nsmall x based on NLO QCD fits tend to give systematically smaller values that are more consistent with the\nQCD-fit values of \u2206\u03a3 in the lower section of the table. This emphasizes the importance of the unmeasured\nregion at small x. We note that the partial first moment of \u2206\u03a3(x) calculated over the range 0 < x < 0.021\nat Q2 = 5 GeV2 from the NLO QCD fit of all available data that is used here for 'evolution' is found to be\n\u22120.1334 \u00b1 0.1104(stat.) \u00b1 0.0273(syst.) \u00b1 0.0604(theo.).\n\n0.0316 \u00b1 0.0008 \u00b1 0.0025 \u00b1 0.0079 \u00b1 0.0025\n0.0219 \u00b1 0.0008 \u00b1 0.0025 \u00b1 0.0079 \u00b1 0.0025\n\nIt may also be relevant that all of the NLO QCD fits\nlisted here differ from the direct extractions in that they\nimpose symmetry among the sea flavours, and invoke the\nBjorken Sum Rule.\nUnder the assumption of SU(3) symmetry, the first\nmoment of the strange-quark helicity distribution can be\nobtained from the relation\n1\n\u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 = (a0 \u2212 a8 )\n3\n\u0011\uf8f9\n\u0010\n\uf8ee\nMS\nMS\n+\n\u2206C\n4\u2206C\nd\na\n8\nS\nNS\n1 \uf8f0 3\u03931\n\uf8fb.\n=\n\u2212\n3\nMS\n12\n\u03c9\n)\n(1\n\u2212\n\u2206CS\n2 d\n\n(47)\n\nThe value \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 = \u22120.085 \u00b1 0.013(theo.) \u00b1\n0.008(exp.) \u00b1 0.009(evol.) is obtained from HERMES\ndeuteron data, in order O(\u03b12s ). This value is negative\nand different from zero by about 4.7 \u03c3.\nThe above results are based on the assumption of the\nvalidity of SU(3) flavor symmetry in hyperon \u03b2-decays.\nThe validity of this assumption is open to question. A\nrecent analysis [90] of such data leads, however, to the\nconclusion that such symmetry breaking effects are small.\nEven if we assume that SU(3) symmetry is broken by up\nto 20% and that a8 lies in the range 0.47 \u2264 a8 \u2264 0.70,\nthe above conclusions are little changed and one obtains\n0.358 \u2265 a0 \u2265 0.302 and \u22120.037 \u2264 \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 \u2264 \u22120.133.\nIt is interesting to note that a recent global NLO fit of\nthe previous world data for polarized inclusive and semiinclusive deep-inelastic scattering [91], which was made\nwithout the assumption of SU(3) flavor symmetry, results\nin a small SU(3) breaking of -1% to -8%, a value of \u2206s between -0.045 and -0.051 and a value of \u2206\u03a3 between 0.284\nand 0.311, depending on the set of NLO fragmentation\nfunctions used in the analysis.\nValues for \u2206u + \u2206\u016b and \u2206d + \u2206d \u0304 can be determined\nin the M S scheme using as experimental input the value\nof a0 extracted from the deuteron data and as additional\n\n\f25\n \u0304 and \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304\nTABLE X: Values for a0 , \u2206u + \u2206\u016b, \u2206d + \u2206d,\ncalculated according to Eqs.

They\nare somewhat different from the partial moments that\nwere previously extracted in LO by HERMES from semiR 0.6\ninclusive DIS data: 0.023 (\u2206u + \u2206\u016b) dx = 0.599 \u00b1 0.022 \u00b1\nR 0.6\n \u0304 dx = \u22120.280 \u00b1 0.026 \u00b1 0.057, and\n0.065, 0.023 (\u2206d + \u2206d)\nR 0.3\n0.023 \u2206s dx = 0.028\u00b10.033\u00b10.009 [1]. These partial moments for the up- and down-quark helicity distributions\nare smaller in magnitude than the full moments given in\nTable IX, due to the restricted x-range. They also do\nnot invoke the validity of the Bjorken Sum Rule. One\npossible explanation of the difference between the above\n\nHERMES has measured the spin structure function\ng1 (x, Q2 ) of the proton and the deuteron in the kinematic\nrange 0.0041 < x < 0.90 and 0.18 GeV2 < Q2 < 20 GeV2 .\nBy combining the proton and the deuteron data, the neutron spin structure function g1n (x, Q2 ) is extracted.\nIn the HERMES analysis, the measured asymmetries\nare corrected for detector smearing and QED radiative\neffects by applying an unfolding algorithm. As a consequence, the resulting data points are no longer correlated\nsystematically but instead statistically. The full information on the statistical correlations is contained in the\ncovariance matrix. In order to avoid overestimating the\nstatistical uncertainties, it is mandatory to take into account its off-diagonal elements when using the HERMES\ndata for any further analysis. A fair comparison of the\nstatistical power of different experiments is given by the\naccuracy of integrals of structure functions.\nThe statistical precision of the HERMES proton data is\ncomparable to that of the hitherto most precise data from\nSLAC and CERN in the same x range. The HERMES\ndeuteron data provide the most precise published determination of the spin structure function g1d (x, Q2 ), compared to previous measurements. In the region x < 0.03\nthe SMC data favor negative values, while the HERMES\ndeuteron data are compatible with zero, as are the recent\nCOMPASS data.\nThe combination of the HERMES measurements of g1p\nand g1d constrains the neutron spin structure function\ng1n (x) well. Its accuracy is comparable to the E154 result\nthat is obtained from a 3 He target. Its behavior in the\nregion x < 0.03 with hQ2 i < 1 GeV2 differs from the\ndramatic drop-off of g1n (x) for x \u2192 0, earlier conjectured\non the basis of previous data.\nIntegrals of the spin structure function g1 of proton,\ndeuteron and neutron have been calculated in various\nx-ranges and values of Q20 . The HERMES proton integral agrees with E143 and within statistical uncertainties\nalso with SMC, at their respective Q20 -values. The HERMES deuteron integral improves on the accuracy (statistical combined with systematic) of previous results.\nIt appears to saturate for x < 0.04. Assuming this\nsaturation, the first moment of the deuteron structure\nfunction g1 (x, Q2 ) can be determined with small uncertainties due to the extrapolation of g1d towards x = 0.\nIt yields \u0393d1 (Q2 = 5 GeV2 ) = 0.0437 \u00b1 0.0035(total).\nThe difference of twice the proton integral in the meae p = 0.1214 \u00b1 0.0093(total) and the first\nsured range, \u0393\n1\ndeuteron moment, corrected for the D-wave admixture to\nS\neN\nthe deuteron wave function, amounts to \u0393\n= 0.1484 \u00b1\n1\n0.0170(total). It agrees within 2 \u03c3 with the Bjorken Sum\n\n\f26\nS\nRule, \u0393N\n= 0.1821 \u00b1 0.0019, calculated in QCD in\n1\n3\nO(\u03b1s ). From the difference of the theoretical value and\nthe measured value, the contribution of the excluded region 0 \u2264 x < 0.021 to the first proton moment \u0393p1 is\nestimated to yield only 0.017 \u00b1 0.009.\nBased on the assumed saturation of the integral of g1d\nand with the assumption of SU(3) flavor symmetry in\nthe decays of hyperons in the spin- 21 baryon octet, the\nflavor-singlet axial charge a0 has been determined in the\nM S scheme using \u0393d1 and the axial charge a8 as inputs,\nin order \u03b12s .

The HERMES data therefore suggest that the\nquark helicities contribute a substantial fraction to the\nnucleon helicity, but there is still need for a major contribution from gluons and/or orbital angular momenta of\nmore than half of the sum of Eq.

The\ncomplexity of such an algorithm stems from the fact\nthat the calculable absolute cross section of the spindependent radiative background processes, e.g., 'elastic\ntails', must be effectively normalized to the data by comparing simulated and measured unpolarized yields based\non world data on \u03c3UU .\nRadiative effects include vertex corrections to the QED\nhard scattering amplitude, and kinematic migration due\nto radiation of real photons by the lepton in either the\ninitial (ISR) or final (FSR) state. Also ISR may in principle flip the helicity of the incident lepton before it emits\nthe virtual photon [92], reducing the effective 'photon\ndepolarization parameter' to a degree that is correlated\nwith kinematic migration. Thus this additional 'spinstate mixing' doubles the size of the smearing matrix,\nas the kinematic bins for the two spin states are coupled.\nThis generality is retained here for pedagogical reasons in\nspite of the suppression of 'helicity-flip bremsstrahlung'\nby an additional power of \u03b1.\nOur basic assumption here is that radiative effects on\nthe observed experimental cross sections \u03c3 X (x) (X signifying experimental), depending on various kinematic parameters collectively designated x, can be represented by\na pair of coupled integral equations containing elements\nof a matrix of radiative kernels K:\nZ h\ni\nX\n\u2192 \u2192 (x, t) \u03c3 1 (t) + K \u2192 \u2192 (x, t) \u03c3 3 (t) (A1)\n\u03c3\u21d0\ndt K\u21d0\n\u2192 (x) =\n\u21d0\n\u21d0\u21d2\n2\n2\nZ h\ni\nX\n\u2192 \u2192 (x, t) \u03c3 1 (t) + K \u2192 \u2192 (x, t) \u03c3 3 (t) (A2)\n.\n\u03c3\u21d2\ndt K\u21d2\n\u2192 (x) =\n\u21d2\n\u21d2\n\u21d0\n2\n2\nHere the radiative (quasi-)elastic (Bethe-Heitler) background is included by continuing the integrals up to\nxBj = 1. (We neglect the small contribution from the\ntransverse asymmetry A2 .) Because parity is conserved\nin QED, we have\n\u2192 \u2192 = K \u2192 \u2192 \u2261 Kdiag\nK\u21d0\n\u21d0\n\u21d2\u21d2\n\u2192 \u2192 = K \u2192 \u2192 \u2261 Kof f .\nK\u21d0\n\u21d2\n\u21d2\u21d0\n\n(A3)\n(A4)\n\nIn the absence of radiative effects, these equations simplify to represent the Born-approximation cross section\n\u03c3 B (x) as:\nh\ni\nB\nB\nB\n3 (x)\n\u03c3\u21d0\nKdiag\n(x) \u03c3 12 (x) + Kof\n(x)\n\u03c3\n(A5)\n\u2192 (x) =\nf\n2\ni\nh\nB\nB\nB\n\u03c3\u21d2\nKof\n\u2192 (x) =\nf (x) \u03c3 12 (x) + Kdiag (x) \u03c3 23 (x) .(A6)\nIn this case, we can recognize the coefficients as representing the effective 'depolarization parameter':\nD(x) =\n\nB\nB\nKdiag\n(x) \u2212 Kof\nf (x)\nB (x) + KB (x)\nKdiag\nof f\n\n.\n\n(A7)\n\n\f19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nexperimental bin\n\nexperimental bin\n\n27\n\nonly binned in x\n\n45\n40\n\n2\n\nbinned in x and Q\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19\n\nBorn bin\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nBorn bin\n\n\u2192 (the M \u2192 matrices look similar) for two different binnings.

The horizontal and\nvertical lines divide the x-bins; within each x-bin the Q2 bins are arranged in increasing Q2 . The matrices are extracted from\na fully reconstructed Monte Carlo data set simulating both QED radiative and detector effects for inclusive DIS on a proton\ntarget.\n\nInverting Eqs. (A5)\u2013(A6) and substituting in\nEqs. (A1)\u2013(A2), we obtain equations relating Born\nand measured yields, of the form:\nZ h\ni\nB\n\u2032\nX\n\u2032\nB\n(x, t) \u03c3\u21d0\n\u03c3\u21d0\ndt Kdiag\n\u2192 (t) + Kof f (x, t) \u03c3 \u2192 (t) (A8)\n\u2192 (x) =\n\u21d2\nZ h\ni\nX\n\u2032\nB\n\u2032\nB\n\u03c3\u21d2\ndt Kof\n.\n\u2192 (x) =\n\u2192 (t) + Kdiag (x, t) \u03c3 \u2192 (t) (A9)\nf (x, t) \u03c3\u21d0\n\u21d2\n\nFor the analysis of experimental data, the kernels in these\nequations are modified to also account for the smearing\neffects of instrumental resolution. The resulting equations are discretized by dividing the experimental (Born)\nkinematic space into ni (nj ) bins, with ni \u2264 nj . It is\nconvenient to work in the 2ni (2nj ) dimensional space\ncontaining vectors consisting of ni (nj ) event yields for\n\u2192\n\u2192\nthe \u21d0 spin state followed by the same number for the \u21d2\nstate. The yield vectors binned in experimental and Born\nvariables are related via the discretization of Eqs. (A8)\u2013\n(A9):\nN X = SN B + N bg ,\nX\n\nB\n\n(A10)\n\nwhere N (N ) is a vector of length 2ni (2nj ) representing experimental (Born) yields, and S is a 2ni \u00d7 2nj\nsmearing matrix. The two ni \u00d7nj equal off-diagonal quar\u2032\nters of S are designated Sof f , and correspond to Kof\nf in\nEqs. (A8)\u2013(A9), while the diagonal quarters Sdiag cor\u2032\n. As none of the kinematic bins are\nrespond to Kdiag\n\nassumed to include the value xBj = 1, the additional\n2ni -vector N bg appears to account for the background\ncontribution from the Bethe-Heitler process as well as\nkinematic migration into the acceptance from outside.\nThe smearing matrix S is extracted from two Monte\nCarlo simulations. One simulation accounts for QED\nradiative effects and includes complete detector simulation, followed by standard event reconstruction. Hence\nkinematic smearing from both radiative and instrumental effects are included. Radiative processes and vertex\ncorrections have been computed using the method outlined in Ref. [93]. The elastic and quasi-elastic radiative backgrounds have been evaluated using parameterizations of the nucleon form factors [94] and the deuteron\nform factors [95]. For the deuteron, the reduction of the\nbound nucleon cross section with respect to that for the\nfree nucleon (quasi-elastic suppression) was evaluated using the results from Ref. [96]. The DIS event generator\nuses parameterizations representing the world data for\n\u03c3UU [76, 77]. The events were generated in the angular\nrange |\u03b8x | < 180 mrad, 35 mrad < |\u03b8y | < 150 mrad of\nobserved kinematics. The electrons are tracked through a\ndetailed GEANT [97] model of the HERMES spectrometer and reconstructed with the same HRC [50] reconstruction algorithm as for real data.\nFor each simulated event, the calculation provides both\nthe kinematic values reconstructed from the spectrometer as well as the 'Born' values describing the primary\nQED vertex where the incident lepton emits the virtual\n\n\f28\nphoton. Hence those Monte Carlo events for spin state,\n\u2192\ne.g., \u21d0 that are selected under the same criteria that are\napplied to the analysis of experimental data can be sorted\n\u2192 , where M \u2192 (i, j)\ninto a ni \u00d7 nj 'migration matrix' M\u21d0\n\u21d0\ncontains the yield of events originating in Born bin j\nand smeared into experimental bin i. Background events\noriginating from the Bethe-Heitler process or from outside the acceptance are not included in M .\nAs an example, Fig. 17 illustrates the migration matrix\n\u2192 (i, j). An x distribution like the one in Fig. 6 repreM\u21d2\nsents a slice along a given Born bin j in the matrix that\nis shown in the left panel of Fig. 17. In the right panel\nof Fig. 17, a migration matrix for the two-dimensional\nx-Q2 binning is displayed. As the unfolding procedure is\noblivious to the kinematic proximity of the bins, it can be\nused for any kind of kinematic binning. Therefore a twodimensional smearing problem can simply be reduced to\na one-dimensional problem.\nThe migration matrices are related to the smearing\nmatrix via the vector N B of Born yields. The vector\nN B is not available from the same Monte Carlo simulation, as some events from inside the nominal kinematic\nacceptance migrate outside and are lost. Hence N B is\nobtained from a second Monte Carlo simulation with the\nsame luminosity but with both radiative and instrumenB\nB\ntal effects omitted. We designate N\u21d0\n\u2192 and N \u2192 to be the\n\u21d2\nnj \u00d7 nj diagonal matrices with diagonal elements that\nare respectively the first and second halves of N B . Then\nthe migration matrices can be written as\nB\nB\n\u2192 = Sdiag N \u2192 + Sof f N \u2192\nM\u21d0\n\u21d0\n\u21d2\n\u2192 =\nM\u21d2\n\nB\nSdiag N\u21d2\n\u2192\n\n+\n\nB\nSof f N\u21d0\n\u2192\n\n(A11)\n.\n\n(A12)\n\nB\nB\nB\nB\nIf we define a discriminant D \u2261 N \u2192\nN\u2192\n\u2212 N\u2192\nN\u2192\n, the\n\u21d0 \u21d0\n\u21d2 \u21d2\nabove equations can be solved to yield:\ni\nh\nB\nB\n\u2192 N\u2192 \u2212 M\u2192 N\u2192\nD\u22121\n(A13)\nSdiag = M\u21d0\n\u21d2 \u21d2\n\u21d0\ni\nh\nB\nB\n\u2192 N\u2192 \u2212 M\u2192 N\u2192\nD\u22121 .\n(A14)\nSof f = M\u21d2\n\u21d0 \u21d2\n\u21d0\n\nThen S can be assembled from Sdiag and Sof f . The\noff-diagonal terms give rise to some dependence on the\nMonte Carlo model for N B . The smearing matrix for\npolarization-averaged data is given by Su = Sdiag + Sof f .\nThe experimental yields need have no absolute normalization in order to subtract the calculable BetheHeitler background because the polarization-averaged\ncross section has been measured with high precision.\nThose two known cross sections are encoded in the\nMonte Carlo event generator. Hence effectively normalizing the polarization-averaged Monte Carlo yields\nto the observed yields results in properly normalized\nBethe-Heitler background yields from the Monte Carlo.\nRepresenting this scheme here requires transformation\n\u2192\n\u2192\nof the \u21d0 and \u21d2 variables into polarization-averaged\nand polarization-difference variables. The ni -vector of\npolarization-averaged yields NuX can be obtained through\n\napplication of an ni \u00d7 2ni projector matrix U (signifying Unpolarized). U is constructed by juxtaposing two\nni \u00d7 ni diagonal matrices, with all diagonal elements of\nboth left and right half equal to 12 . Similarly, the vector\nof polarization-difference yields NpX can be obtained by\napplication of the projector P , which differs from U only\nin that the diagonal elements of the right-hand half are\n\u2212 21 . Thus we have\nNuX = U (SN B + N bg ) = Su NuB + U N bg (A15)\nNpX = P (SN B + N bg ) .\n(A16)\nEq. (A10) applies to the results of the Monte Carlo simulation, which is assumed to describe reality with the possible exception of unsimulated polarization-independent\ndetector inefficiencies. A similar equation relates the vectors representing the measured experimental yields X\nand the corresponding unknown Born yields B, the polarization asymmetry A|| of which is the goal of the analysis.\nWe represent the detector efficiencies in this equation as\nthe elements of an ni \u00d7 ni diagonal matrix Kn . It is convenient to construct a 2ni \u00d7 2ni diagonal matrix K2n by\nrepeating Kn as the diagonal quarters. These constructions are related by U K2n = Kn U and similarly for P .\nThe smearing of the experimental data is then given by:\nX = K2n SB + X bg\n(A17)\nXu = U (K2n SB + X bg ) = Kn Su Bu + U X bg(A18)\nXp = P (K2n SB + X bg ) .\n(A19)\nThe Monte Carlo normalization relative to the experimental data is arbitrary. This is represented here in\nterms of an arbitrary constant c relating the polarizationaveraged Born yields NuB from the Monte Carlo generator\nto B corresponding to the experimental observations:\nBu = cNuB .\n\n(A20)\n\nThe Monte Carlo also correctly describes the entire\npolarization-dependent background N bg and its relationship to the polarization-averaged yields. Hence the same\nnormalization constant applies to the background terms:\nX bg = cK2n N bg .\n\n(A21)\n\nCombining this relation with Eqs. (A15), (A18) and\n(A20), we have:\nXu = cKn NuX .\n\n(A22)\n\nNote that such a relationship does not generally hold for\nXp , as the Monte Carlo model for NpX need not describe\nreality.\nRearranging Eq. (A15) and applying Eq. (A20), we\nget:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(A23)\nU SB = c NuX \u2212 U N bg .\n\n\f29\nThe diagonal ni \u00d7 ni matrix Am\n|| containing the measured\nasymmetries is defined as\nXp (i)\n.\nXu (i)\n\nAm\n|| (i, i) \u2261\n\n(A24)\n\nThen applying Eq. (A19), we get:\nbg\nAm\n|| Xu = Xp = P (K2n SB + X ) .\n\n(A25)\n\nRearranging, applying Eqs. (A21), (A22) and P K2n =\nKn P , and then multiplying both sides by Kn\u22121 , we get\nbg\nP K2n SB = Am\n|| Xu \u2212 P X\ni\nh\nX\nbg\n,\nP SB = c Am\n|| Nu \u2212 P N\n\n(A26)\n\nm\nwhere we have used Am\n|| Kn = Kn A|| , as both Kn and\nm\nA|| are diagonal. We now stack the two ni \u00d7 2ni projector\n\u001a \u001bmatrices U and P to form the 2ni \u00d7 2ni projector\nU\n. We also concatinate the two vectors NuX and\nP\no\nn\nX\nX\nm X\n. With\nN\nN\nto\nform\nthe\n2n\n-vector\nN\n:\nA\nAm\ni\nu\nu\nu\n||\n||\n\nthese combinations, we can unify Eqs. (A23) and (A26):\n\u001a\n\nU\nP\n\n\u001b\n\nSB = c\n\n\u0014n\n\nNuX\n\n:\n\nX\nAm\n|| Nu\n\no\n\n\u2212\n\n\u001a\n\nU\nP\n\n\u001b\n\nN\n\nbg\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(A27)\nThis system may be solved for the unknown vector B. If\nni = nj \u2261 n, this may be done by multiplying both sides\n\u0014\u001a \u001b \u0015\u22121\nU\nS\nto get:\nby\nP\n\n\u0015\n\u001b \u0015\u22121 \u0014n\no \u001a \u001b\nU\nbg\nX\nm X\n.\nS\nN\nB=c\nNu : A|| Nu \u2212\nP\n(A28)\nFinally, we form the Born asymmetry of interest:\n\u0014\u001a\n\nwhere we have used Eq. (A20) and U B = Bu .\nUnfolding causes an inflation of the statistical uncertainty of the asymmetry, driven by the elastic contamination at low x and by detector smearing at large x.\nThis last effect depends on the momentum resolution\nand is thus larger at lower values of y (and hence lower\nQ2 ). Thus the Q2 binning separates regions with different degrees of smearing. The amount of smearing in the\nvariable Q2 is much smaller than that in x. In Fig. 18\n(top two panels), the measured and Born asymmetries\nare shown, while in the bottom panel the uncertainty\ninflation for Ak is depicted.\nThe statistical uncertainties of the Monte Carlo data\nenter mainly via the simulated experimental count rates\nin the migration matrices. In order to propagate these\nstatistical uncertainties through the unfolding algorithm\nwith its matrix inversion and to evaluate the influence\non the unfolded Born level asymmetry A|| , a numerical approach is used. The measured asymmetry is unfolded N = 10000 times using modified migration matrices. Each time all elements are selected from a Gaussian\ndistribution corresponding to their respective statistical\nuncertainty. The standard deviation in each bin and the\ncorrelation between different bins of the unfolded results\nare calculated. The (statistics-based) covariance of A||\ncoming from the unfolding and the one coming from the\nfinite statistics of the Monte Carlo are summed; the result is called statistical uncertainty.\n\nAPPENDIX B: AVERAGES\n\nU\nP\n\nA|| (j) =\n\n[P B](j)\n,\n[U B](j)\n\nj = 1... n,\n\n(A29)\n\nn\nX\n\nD(i, k)D(j, k) \u03c3 2 (Am\n|| (k)) ,\n\n(A30)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03c3(Am\n|| (k)) is the statistical uncertainty of the measured asymmetry Am\n|| (k), and the matrix D is defined\nas:\nD(j, i) \u2261\n\n=\n\n\u2202A|| (j)\n\u2202Am\n|| (i)\n\" \u0014\u001a \u001b \u0015 #\n\u22121\nU\nS\n(j, i + n) NuX (i)\nP\nP\nNuB (j)\n\nMatrix calculation\n\nTo obtain an expression for the weighted average of\ncorrelated quantities, it is necessary to start from the \u03c72\ndefinition:\n\u03c72 = (y \u2212 F I)T C \u22121 (y \u2212 F I) ,\n\nwhere the constant c cancels.

XXVIII: Recent published values of \u2206\u03a3, separated into experimental evaluations based on the g1 integral on a given\ntarget, and evaluations from QCD fits, published from 2000 on, based on all g1 data available at the times of publication. All\nevaluations are in the M S scheme. The HERMES results refer to the present analysis. The results for E154 and SMC were\ncalculated from values of \u03931 given by those collaborations, as values of \u2206\u03a3 were not provided. Some analyses used \u2206CNS in\norder \u03b13s (NNNLO) and \u2206CS in order \u03b12s (NNLO). Thus the order in the table was labelled as (N)NNLO, being a mixture of\nNNNLO and NNLO. The last column refers to the method used by the experimental groups to calculate the low-x extrapolation\nneeded to compute the integral over the full x range. In the case of E143, the low-x extrapolation (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.03) is calculated\nas an average of four fits, details of which can be found in Ref. [26].\nAnalysis\n\nyear\n\nQ2\n(GeV2 )\n\nE142 [72]\nE154 [32]\nSMC [25]\nSMC [25]\nE143 [26]\n\"\nE155 [27]\n\"\nHERMES\n\"\n\"\n\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1998\n1998\n\"\n1999\n\"\n2006\n\"\n\"\n\nE155 [98]\nGRSV[35]\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\nBB [36]\ndFNS [91]\n\"\nAAC [99]\nLSS[100]\n\n2000\n2001\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n2002\n2005\n\"\n2006\n2006\n\n2\n5\n10\n10\n3\n\"\n5\n\"\n5\n\"\n\"\nQCD fits\n5\n1\n\"\n5\n\"\n10\n\"\n4\n10\n\"\n1\n1\n\n\u2206\u03a3\n\ntarget\n\norder\n\nExperimental evaluations\n0.43 \u00b1 0.12(total)\n0.191 \u00b1 0.011(theor.) \u00b1 0.080(exp.) \u00b1 0.070(evol.)\n0.116 \u00b1 0.011(theor.) \u00b1 0.079(exp.) \u00b1 0.138(evol.)\n0.060 \u00b1 0.008(theor.) \u00b1 0.075(exp.) \u00b1 0.139(evol.)\n0.32 \u00b1 0.10(total)\n0.37 \u00b1 0.08(total)\n0.15 \u00b1 0.03(stat.) \u00b1 0.08(syst.)\n0.18 \u00b1 0.03(stat.) \u00b1 0.08(syst.)\n0.321 \u00b1 0.011(theor.) \u00b1 0.024(exp.) \u00b1 0.028(evol.)\n0.330 \u00b1 0.011(theor.) \u00b1 0.025(exp.) \u00b1 0.028(evol.)\n0.333 \u00b1 0.011(theor.) \u00b1 0.025(exp.) \u00b1 0.028(evol.)\n\nn(3 He)\nn(3 He)\np\nd\np\nd\nd\n\"\nd\n\"\n\"\n\n(N)NNLO\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\nNLO\nNNLO\n(N)NNLO\n\n-\n\nNLO\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\n0.23 \u00b1 0.04(stat.) \u00b10.06(syst.)\n0.204 (standard scenario)\n0.282 (valence scenario)\n0.197 (standard scenario)\n0.273 (valence scenario)\n0.197 (standard scenario)\n0.272 (valence scenario)\n0.14 \u00b1 0.08(stat.)\n0.284 (KRE)\n0.311 (KKP)\n0.25 \u00b1 0.10\n0.219 \u00b1 0.042\n\nlow-x extr.\n\nRegge\nE154 QCD fit\nSMC QCD fit\n\"\nsee caption\n\"\nE154 QCD fit\nSMC QCD fit\nnone\n\"\n\"\n\n[32]\n[33]\n\n[32]\n[33]\n\n\f"}
