It is introduced and motivated\nin the context of Randers spaces an example of simple 't Hooft model\nwith interactions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe possibility to use deterministic models at the Planck scale has been\npresented for instance in references [1] and [2]. Following these ideas, Hilbert\nspace techniques are useful tools to deal with probabilistic predictions at\natomic, nuclear or Standard Model scale physics. Quantum mechanics is\nconsidered to be a powerful formalism to deal with the chaotic evolution\nof these systems. However the behavior of physical systems at the Planck\nscale can be very different. Therefore deterministic models can be useful to\ndescribe the physical systems at this more fundamental level.\nParticular motivations to investigate deterministic models at the Planck\nscale have been explained in [1]. We recall briefly some of these reasons:\n\n1\n\n\f1. Firstly, there is the feeling that fundamental concepts like locality,\nspace and time are becoming more and more obscure in Contemporary\nPhysics and that this tendency will gradually grow in modern quantum\ntheories. It seems that it is not a nice consequence of Modern Physics.\n2. Secondly, there are conceptual problems related with quantum cosmology. Let us suppose that the physical system being described is the\nentire universe through a master quantum wave function. The meaning of this wave function of the universe is problematic because we can\nnot make any experiment to test the correctness of it: we live in one\nuniverse only and we do not have an ensemble of identical universes\nto check the probabilistic predictions of the theory. It seems it is not\npossible to contrast a quantum model of the whole universe.\n3. Thirdly, black hole Physics is problematic from the point of view of\nQuantum Mechanics. The research in this area has produced, among\nother results, the discovery of a fundamental principle as the holographic principle [2]. The interpretation of this principle is not intuitive from a field theory point of view; let us consider the fundamental\narea\nAp = 4 ln2 L2p ,\nwhere Lp is the Planck length. This principle can be stated the following way\nThe quantum degrees of freedom at the Planck scale of a physical\nsystem are distributed on a surface such that corresponds one boolean\ndegree of freedom for fundamental area Ap .\nIn a local quantum field theory the density of states is proportional\nto the volume of the system. Therefore, an interpretation of the holographic principle in the framework of a local quantum field theory\nbecomes difficult.\n4. Finally, physicists have found strong difficulties in their attempts to\nunify quantum mechanics with a theory of gravity. This unified theory\nshould be important at short distances, where gravity become strong\nand comparable to other interactions. Usually the strategy consist on\nsearching for the right laws of gravity at short distances, maintaining\n2\n\n\fQuantum Mechanics as a complete theory. This persistent problem is\na reason to reconsider the status of Quantum Mechanics as a fundamental theory at the scale where is gravity so strong enough as other\ninteractions.\nThe approach advocated in reference [1] is to investigate deterministic\nsystems at the Planck scale as an alternative way to solve these problems.\nDue to a dissipative dynamics, after a long term evolution, different states\nevolve to the same one, reducing the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. All\nthe ontological states evolving to the same state define an equivalence class.\nThe equivalence classes can be non-locally defined and it is speculated they\nare the states described by rays of a Hilbert space, as they are represented\nin Quantum Mechanics. In addition it was showed that the use of Hilbert\nspace theory in the description of these deterministic models is useful to find\nthe connection with ordinary Quantum Mechanics.\nThe Hilbert space approach to deterministic systems has some problems.\nThe main one is that the Hamiltonian of a deterministic system is linear\nin the momentum variables and therefore is not bounded from below. This\nimplies the instability of the system. In addition, only few examples are\nknown with a mechanism generating a Hamiltonian bounded from below\nbut these models do not involve interactions. Moreover, any deterministic\ndescription of Quantum Mechanics seems to be plagued by Bell's inequalities.\nIt was conjectured in [1] that at the Planck scale physical systems do not\nmeet the required symmetries used in the proof of Bell's inequalities for spin\nstates. The reason is that at this level the system can be so complex that\nusual rotation symmetries does not hold.\nIt is known the geometric nature or interpretation of important physical\nmodels. For instance, the point particle action is the length of a curve, the\nstring action is a generalized area and Yang-Mills actions are functional of\nconnections on bundles. General Relativity also has an interpretation in\nterms of Semi-Riemannian geometry. The objective nature of the geometric\nentities (that is, covariance respect a transformation group) implies the relevance of the geometric actions, making apparent the independence of the\nphysical phenomenon from the particular way of description adopted. We\ncan said that the actions of important physical models are related with Riemannian or Semi-Riemannian structures an generalized notions of distance\nmetrics.\nFinsler structures are actually natural and constitutes a branch from Differential Geometry and Theoretical Physics with a huge recent development\n3\n\n\f(some general references for Finsler geometry and some of its applications\nare [4]-[9]). Finsler structures are as natural as Riemannian structures but\nhave less restrictions than Riemannian ones and sometimes seems strange\nwhy they not appeared recently in field theory in a natural way. Nevertheless\nrecently considerable work have be done in some applications in String Theory and General Relativity (for instance in [6]) and in the Thermodynamics\nTheory in curved spaces ([6] and references therein). Previous applications\nof Finsler geometry to physics were performed by the school of Miron at\nRumania ([7]-[9]).\nHowever our application of Finsler geometry to get deterministic models\nis complete different. It is based on the following general ideas:\n1. In the construction of physical models geometric structures are of extreme importance. Indeed more of the main theories like string and\nGeneral Relativity are formulated using metric theories, in particular\nstructures existing in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Metric structures are usually required and natural.\n2. If we are looking for a formalism that could be also applicable to the\nwhole universe, it should contain an irreversible element. We live in\none universe and the notion of reversible law is maybe not completely\nvalid because it is not completely under experimental control when it\nis applied to a large portion of the universe or to the whole universe.\nFinsler geometry have enough ingredients to address both points. Probably is not the only possibility, but we were able to use this sophisticated\ngeometry to find some results that maybe can be useful for future research\non this line. Finslerian distance (ussualy associated to the length of a curve\nusing the Finsler metric) can be non-symmetric, that is, the \"distance between the point a and the point b is not the same than the distance from\nb to a. We consider that non-symmetric Finsler metrics (that means when\nthe above a-symmetry it is possible) are useful to describe the behavior of\nirreversible evolutions at the fundamental scale. For example, the action of\na particle moving in a Finsler space is not invariant under the inversion of\nthe parameter of the curve. This asymmetry in the metric implies the possibility to describe an irreversible evolution from a geometric point of view.\nThis is the main reason to use models in Physics based on Finsler geometry\n(another idea of how to describe Thermodynamics using Finsler structures\ncan be found in [5]. However our application mainly differs from this one\n\n4\n\n\fbecause we are concerning with the most basic level in the description of\nphenomena).\nThe aim of the present work is both. Firstly, we investigate some general\nconsequences of the 't Hooft theory. Secondly, in order to give a geometric\nbasis for the theory, we explain the relation of 't Hooft's models with the\nFinsler structure of the cotangent bundle of the tangent bundle of the configuration manifold M, T\u2217 TM. Finslerian models are free of some problems\nof the initial 't Hooft's theory. In particular, they provide a geometric argument to obtain a lower bound for a Hamiltonian coming from a deterministic\nsystem.\nThe structure of this work is as follows. In Section 2, the basic notions\nand results of the 't Hooft theory are presented. Also, the main problems of\nthis approach are explained.\nIn Section 3, the use of Finsler geometry to find deterministic models\nis presented. In addition we develop some consequences of the finslerian\napproach as the existence of a higher limit for generalized physical acceleration and speed. We describe the spontaneous symmetric breaking that can\nhappening in Finslerian deterministic model. The possible absence of Bell's\ninequalities for spin at the Planck scale is also argued, but the argument can\nbe changed to a more general framework than finslerian models, provide a\ngeometric argument is possible.\nIn Section 4 we to discuss our results in the context of the geometry of\nspaces of smooth Finsler structures is made. We describe a simple deterministic model where interactions are present. This model is based on some\ngeometric construction and some additional physical requirements.\nFinally, we attach in Appendix A the basic definitions and results of\nFinsler geometry and other geometric objects mentioned in this work.\n\n2\n\nThe 't Hooft Theory\n\nGerard't Hooft has investigated the possibility to use deterministic models\nin order to describe physical systems at the Planck scale through a Hilbert\nspace formulation ([1],[2]) of these models. The physical system is described\nby an eigenstate | x > of a set of commuting operators {X\u0302i (t)},\n[X\u0302i (t), X\u0302j (t\u0303)] = 0, \u2200i, j,\n\nX\u0302i (t)|x >= xi (t)|x >,\n\nsuch that the eigenvalues {xi (t)} completely describe the state of the system.\nThis states are called ontological. The parameter t is associated with a\n5\n\n\fmacroscopic phenomenon or device and used as the time parameter by an\nmacroscopic observer, although we are considering, microscopic processes,\nthat is at the level of the determinisic description. At each instant t, the\nphysical system is in correspondence with a particular vector defined by the\nset of eigenvalues {xi (t)}. This set of functions define the real configuration\nof the system at any instant t. The Hilbert space is generated by the vectors\nrepresenting the configurations of the physical system. A linear combination\nof elements of a basis of the Hilbert space produces a vector such that the\nsquare of the module of each component is the probability of the system to\nbe in this particular state.\nThe Hamiltonian of a deterministic system with 6N degrees of freedom\nin the phase space is\n6N\nX\npi f i (x) + g(x).\n(2.1)\nH=\ni=1\n\n(x, p) are canonical variables, {xi , pj } = \u03b4ij . After canonical quantization\nthis Hamiltonian reproduces the evolution differential equations, which are\nthe Heisenberg equations for the operators {X i , i = 1, ..., 6N },\ndX\u0302 i\n= f i (X\u0302),\ndt\n\ni = 1, ..., 6N.\n\n(2.2)\n\nWhen we take the average value of the equation (2.2) we obtain\n< x\u0303|\n\n\u0001\ndX\u0302 i\n\u2212 f i (X\u0302) |x >= 0,\ndt\n\ni = 1, ..., 6N.\n\nThis implies the classical ordinary differential equations\ndxi\n= f i (x),\ndt\n\ni = 1, ..., 6N\n\n(2.3)\n\nbecause the scalar product of the Hilbert space is positive defined. Any\nsystem whose evolution is given by the equations (2.3) and has a complete\nand defined set of initial conditions is called deterministic.\nLet us consider the quantization of the Hamiltonian (2.1). It does not\nhave a minimal eigenvalue because it is linear in momentum. However, the\nexistence of a ground state is essential for the stability of the physical system.\nThis parameter is a fundamental difficulty in the Hilbert space formulation\nof deterministic systems.\nThis problem let us consider a dissipative dynamics a system with a\nrather turbulent or chaotic behavior at the beginning can reach stability in\n6\n\n\fa finite time. This kind of dissipation implies the possibility to define the\nphysical states as equivalence classes at equilibrium. An equivalence class is\ndefined by the set of ontological states that after a long term in the parameter\nt, evolve to the same final state.\n't Hooft have proposed the following solution to the problem of the missing of the lower-bound of the Hamiltonian: If dissipation of information it\nis possible, the final Hamiltonian could be bounded from below. It was suggested in reference [1] and [2] that the actual Quantum Mechanics describes\nnot the basic degrees of freedom of our universe, but the dynamics of equivalence classes reached by these basic states after a long term evolution with\na dissipation of information: various states can evolve to the same equilibrium state. The ontological states follow a deterministic dynamics which is\ndescribed by the set of first order, ordinary differential equations of the type\n(2.3) (in addition with a complete set of initial conditions). These states are\nlocally well defined. By contrast, the equivalence classes of states could not\nbe locally well defined and their evolution is quantum mechanical.\nThis evolution onto equivalence classes can solve the problem of the\nground state because the number of them is smaller than the number of\nontological states. It could be that even with an infinite number of ontological states, we have a finite number of equivalence classes, a finite Hilbert\nspace and as a consequence the Hamiltonian has a defined ground state ([1]).\nSeveral examples has been found by 't Hooft where there is a mechanism\nproducing a Hamiltonian with lower bound: the free bosonic system, the\nfree Maxwell field and the free mass-less neutrino system are deterministic\nsystems. These examples at least prove the existence of deterministic models\nwith Hamiltonian bounded from below.\nIn this work we denote by a 't Hooft model a deterministic system with a\nmechanism producing a lower bound for the final Hamiltonian at equilibrium.\nBy dissipative mechanism we mean an information loss mechanism.\n\n3\n\nFinslerian Deterministic Quantum models at the\nPlanck scale\n\nLet us denote by M the configuration manifold of all the degrees of freedom\nat the Planck scale. By configuration manifold we mean a sub-manifold M\nof a 2n-manifold N such that TM = N. With this definition we adopt the\nformalism of Lagrange spaces ([7]) (indeed dual of Lagrange spaces), instead\nof considering the formalism of higher order Lagrange spaces([8]).\nThe relation between Finsler structures and deterministic systems is\n7\n\n\fbased on the following points:\n1. The ontological states at the Planck scale are described by points of\nthe phase space T\u2217 TM and the tangent bundle TM is equipped with\na dual Randers metric F \u2217 .\n2. The reduction of the ontological Hilbert space to the quantum mechanical Hilbert space is in correspondence with the reduction of the\nRanders structure (TM, F \u2217 ) to the Riemannian structure (TM, h).\nWe postulate that this reduction corresponds to the average operation\ninvestigated in reference [10].\ni\n\n3. We assume that for each particle with generalized velocity y = dx\ndt\nthere is another particle associated such that it is evolving backwards\nin time t with velocity \u2212y and the separation between them is zero.\nFor the definition of a Finsler structure and Randers structures, basic notions\nin the present work, we refer to the Appendix A or to reference [4]. The\nterm dual makes reference to the manifold T\u2217 TM where F \u2217 lives in our\nformalism. This spaces are treated in the literature (see reference [6] and\nreferences therein) and are called Cartan spaces. Points 1 and 2 are the main\nlink between Geometry and Physics in our proposal. Point 1 is a nominative\naxiom, relating notions from Geometry and Physics. Point 2 refers to the\nlink between the geometric theory of Finsler geometry described in [10] with\na reduction of the associated Hilbert space. This point is capital to find the\nLink between Quantum Mechanics and Deterministic Models at the Planck\nscale. It is only explanatory; while point 1 is completely arbitrary, point 2\nis just a consequence of point 1 and the theory developed in [10]. Point 3\nis a generalization of the particle-anti-particle creation in the context of a\nnon-symmetric geometry background. Due to this asymmetry, a non-trivial\nsystem arise with a defined fundamental time-arrow.\nIn addition to the above statements we note other two implicit facts in\nour construction:\n1. There is a microscopic time arrow associated with the mechanism that\nproduces the evolution from the Randers structure (TM, F \u2217 ) to the\nactual Riemannian structure (TM, h).\n2. There is a Hamiltonian function obtained directly from the geometric\ndata contained in the Randers structure (TM, F \u2217 ):\n\n8\n\n\fConsider a Randers function F \u2217 with the following form (see Appendix A for\nthe definition of Randers space),\nF \u2217 (x, p) = \u03b1(x, p) + \u03b2(x, p).\nThen, we perform the following identification between the Hamiltonian function and the non-symmetric part of the Randers function,\nH=\n\nn\nX\n\ni\n\npi f (x) \u2212\u2192 2\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b2 i (x)pi\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nand if we identify component by component,\n2\u03b2 i = f i ,\n\ni = 1, ..., 6N.\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe ordinary differential equations (2.3) are then\nf i = \u03b2i =\n\ndxi\n,\ndt\n\ni = 1, .., 6N.\n\n(3.3)\n\nIn order to quantize the model we use the canonical quantization through\nthe prescription\nxi \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 i ,\n\n\u03b2 i (x) \u2212\u2192 \u03b2 i (X\u0302),\n\npi \u2212\u2192 \u2212i\n\n\u2202\n= P\u0302i .\n\u2202xi\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis representation holds the canonical quantization relation:\n[X\u0302i , P\u0302j ] = \u03b4ij .\nThe reason why we choose the above Hamiltonian function (3.1) is the\nfollowing: the first term corresponds to a particle moving forward in time\nwhile the second term corresponds to a particle moving backward in time,\nboth at the same position; there is a democracy in the choice of the macroscopic time arrow.\nWe would like to justify more in detail the Hamiltonian function (3.1).\nSince we use phase space variables, we translate the above assumption from\nvelocities to momentum variables. An example of a dual Finsler structure\nwith Finsler function F \u2217 living in the cotangent bundle T\u2217 (TM) is defined\nusing the following procedure: if (TM, F ) is a Finsler structure, let us consider the dual Finsler structure defined by:\nF \u2217 (x, p) := F (x, yp ) such that yp (p\u0303) := gyp (p, p\u0303),\n9\n\n\f\u2202\n\u2217\np~ = pi \u2202x\ni \u2208 Tu Tx M; y \u2208 Tu Tx M. yp is the dual vector of the 1-form p\ndefined by the second relation. gyp is the fundamental tensor of the structure\n(TM, F ) evaluated at the point yp (for the definition, see appendix A).\nThe classical Hamiltonian function (3.2) coincides with:\n\nH = F \u2217 (x, p) \u2212 F \u2217 (\u03c4 (x), \u03c4 (p)) = 2\u03b2 i pi .\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe transformation \u03c4 is the time inversion operator respect the microscopic\ntime t. The action of time inversion operator in the canonical variables is\ndefined such that the canonical relation {xi , pj } = \u03b4ij remains invariant.\nThe quantization of the above models is equivalent to the quantum mechanical description of a deterministic system. The quantized Hamiltonian\nis defined by:\n\u0124 = F \u2217 (X\u0302, P\u0302 ) \u2212 F \u2217 (T\u0302 X\u0302 T\u0302 \u22121 , T\u0302 P\u0302 T\u0302 \u22121 ).\nT\u0302 is the time inversion operator. The Hamiltonian is\n\u0124 = 2\u03b2 i (X\u0302)P\u0302i .\n\n(3.6)\n\nA simple calculation shows that for this Hamiltonian the relation T\u0302 \u0124T\u0302 \u22121 =\n\u2212\u0124 holds and that the elementary evolution operator\n\u00db(t, t + \u03b4t) = I\u02c6 \u2212 i\u03b4t\u0124\nis invariant under time inversion T\u0302 , producing a geometric time arrow (note\nthat states are invariant by the time inversion operation).\nThe Hamiltonian (3.6) is not bounded from below. In order to solve\nthis problem we propose the following mechanism: let us define the average\nclassical Hamiltonian defined by\nZ\nH(x, p)|\u03c8(x, p)|2 d6N \u22121 p.\n< H >:=\nI\u2217x\n\nThe manifold I\u2217x \u2282 T\u2217x (TM) is defined by I\u2217x := {p \u2208 T\u2217x (TM) | F \u2217 (x, p) =\n1}. |\u03c8(x, p)|2 is a weight function on the indicatrix I\u2217x and it is determined\nby the geometric data (TM, F \u2217 ).\nThe justification of this construction is the following. In reference [10]\nit was proved the existence of a map from the Finsler category to the Riemannian category relating the most important geometric notions. This map\nwas basically interpreted as \"average\" of the finslerian objects (although in\n[10] we formulated our mathematical construction mainly related with the\nso-named Chern's connection. However, it was noted that a similar average\n10\n\n\foperation is also applicable to other connection as the Cartan connection or\nin general to any linear connection in \u03c0 \u2217 TM. We also think that the construction is also extendable to the non-linear connection, a very important\nnotion in Finsler geometry). Here we remark that this average operation is\nalso applicable to the Hamiltonian operator after canonical quantization of\nthe classical Hamiltonian because it is constructed using the Finsler function.\nThis average is interpreted as a long term evolution of the initial Hamiltonian. Another more physical reason to integrate only over I\u2217x is the \"Holographic Principle in phase space\": all the quantum information is contained\nin a sub-manifold of dimension n \u2212 1, in this case the indicatrix I\u2217x . This\nholographic principle is formulated in the phase space instead of the normal\nformulation in the configuration space and appears as a re-interpretation\nof the positive homogeneity requirement. It seems to be possible to translate this construction to the configuration space just through a generalized\nFourier transformation.\nThe above average Hamiltonian function has an associated quantum operator (better a density operator) < \u0124 >. This operator is defined by the\naction on an arbitrary element of the Hilbert space of the states of defined\ngeneralized coordinates:\nZ\n\u02c6\n\u0124(X\u0302, P\u0302 )|\u03c8(x, p) |2 |p > d6N \u22121 p =\n< H >x (X\u0302, P\u0302 ) | p >:=\nI\u2217x\n\nZ\n\n(H(x, p)|\u03c8(x, p) |2 )|p + G(x) > d6N \u22121 p,\n\n\u2200 |p > \u2208 H.\n\n(3.7)\n\nI\u2217x\n\nThe average quantum Hamiltonian density operator < \u0124 > (X\u0302, P\u0302 ) is linear.\n{| p >} is the set of vectors such that the Finsler norm is 1: P\u0302 i | p >= pi | p >\nwith F \u2217 (x, p) = 1. The function G(x) is the translation produced by the\noperators X\u0302 i on the momentum state | p >, computable from the canonical\nconditions and the form of the operators \u03b2 i (X\u0302).\nThe first property of the above Hamiltonian (3.7)comes from the definition of Randers space. All the terms are bounded and positive defined\nbecause the functions {\u03b2 i } are bounded and also because we are integrating\nonly over the indicatrix I\u2217x . Therefore we obtain the following result,\nTheorem 3.1 Let (TM, F \u2217 ) be a Randers space. Then there is a deterministic system with the average Hamiltonian density defined by the relation\n(3.7) and with \u0124 defined by the equation (3.6). Then the average Hamiltonian < H >x is bounded.\n\n11\n\n\fThe local converse of this result also holds, proving the generality of the\nconnection between deterministic systems and Randers geometry,\nTheorem 3.2 Let \u0124 = 2\u03b2 i (X\u0302)P\u0302i be a quantum Hamiltonian operator describing a deterministic system. Suppose that the average Hamiltonian is\nbounded. Then there is a Randers structure that reproduces the above Hamiltonian and the Randers function is defined locally at one point by the expression:\nq\nF (x, p) = \u03b4ij pi pj + fi pi .\nProof: We read from the Riemannian metric and the 1-form that characterizes the Randers structure from the Hamiltonian; the Hamiltonian of a\ndeterministic system is of the form H = f i (x)pi . We associated the following\nstructure locally such at the point x it is given by:\naij = \u03b4ij ,\n\n2\u03b2 i (x) = f i (x),\n\nwhere the functions f i (x) characterize the deterministic system. That the\nfinal Hamiltonian is bounded implies the functions \u03b2 i (x) are also bounded,\nthat is a fundamental requirement to obtain a Randers function.\n\u2737\nIt is important to note that the Randers structure of the thesis of Theorem 3.2 and the Randers structure of the hypothesis of Theorem 3.1 are\nnot the same. The reason is because they describe different deterministic\nsystems. In addition let us note that the Riemannian structure aij = \u03b4ij\nis arbitrary: our choice was the simplest one, but it can be constrained because the topology of the manifold TM (although locally the Finsler structure looks like in theorem 3.2) and by physical consistency as we will see\n(\u03b2 should be bounded by aij ). When the metric a is given globally we can\nextend beta, defining a Randers space in the whole manifold TM, assuming\nthat it is simply connected.\nAnother consequence of the geometric origin of the Hamiltonian is that\nbecause the requirements that F \u2217 is a Randers function, the functions {\u03b2 i }\nare bounded. This implies that generalized velocities and accelerations of\nthe particles are bounded,\nCorollary 3.3 Consider a deterministic system associated with a Randers\nspace. Then the generalized speed and acceleration of any physical sub-system\nare bounded.\n\n12\n\n\fThis consequence is interesting because it means the following for our model.\nFrom the geometric point of view bounded means respect the metric structure aij of the given Randers structure (\u03b1, \u03b2). Because both accelerations\nand velocities can become observables in some models, also happens with\nthe metric aij , which becomes not arbitrary and dynamical. The problem\nto find the correct structure such that the 1-form \u03b2 is bounded with the\nRiemannian metric aij implies some additional hypothesis concerning the\ndynamical behavior of both.\nAs consequence of the existence of a maximal physical acceleration, there\nis a limit for the strength of the gravitational field, if the strong equivalence\nprinciple holds. Therefore we are dealing with a theory that contains a finite\ngravitational interaction.\nA simple mechanical model can give an estimation of the value of the\nmaximal acceleration. Suppose that the universe has a limited energy content, there is a minimal distance Lp , the maximal speed is c and the ontological degrees of freedom of the model describe the molecules of a classical\ngas. We can write the elementary work that the rest of the universe can\nmake on a defined subsystem. Since this maximal work is equivalent to the\nenergy of the particles involved, we obtain the relation\nLp map \u223c \u03b4mc2 .\nThe maximal exchange of energy is bounded by \u223c MU c2 , where MU is the\nequivalent mass of the total energy of the universe, excluding the sub-system\nconsidered. The mass m appearing in the left side is just the mass of the\nparticle, and if this mass is the Planck mass Mp , then\nap \u223c\n\nMU c2\n.\nMp Lp\n\nThis acceleration is very huge when LP is the Planck scale,\nap \u223c\n\nMU 52\n10 m/s2 .\nMp\n\nIf the change in the state of the sub-system is only produced by the\nneighborhood of the elementary particle, then instead of MU there is a mass\ncomparable to m. Therefore the maximal acceleration is\nap \u223c 1052 m/s2 .\nNote that this acceleration is independent of the mass of the particles. This\nimplies that the equivalence principle for the maximal acceleration holds\n13\n\n\fin this limit. In addition, this example shows the equivalence between the\nmaximal acceleration and a minimal length Lp , when there is a maximal\nspeed c.\nAs another example of application of our geometric formalism, let us consider the Hamiltonian describing a deterministic system with 12 degrees of\nfreedom associated with two pairs of particles living in a space M of dimension three. The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is contained in\nthe group O(12) because it is the Euclidean product of two vectors of a\n12-dimensional space (by associated particles we mean a pair of identical\nparticles such that they are at the same position but one is moving forward\nand the other backward on the external time t). Let us consider a particular configuration describing a system of two correlated pairs of associated\nparticles and their environment. The symmetry group for this special configuration contains the group O(6) \u00d7 O(6) \u00d7 G, where the first two terms\nO(6) describe the symmetry related with the two separated pair of particles\nand G determines the symmetry of any other sub-system. This configuration\nimplies an spontaneous symmetry break of the group O(6N ),\nO(6N ) \u2212\u2192 O(6) \u00d7 O(6) \u00d7 G.\nThis symmetry break produces Goldstone's bosons that we consider part of\nthe environment.\nConsider the sub-system composed by two correlated pairs. The symmetry of this Hamiltonian is O(6) \u00d7 O(6). The existence of an internal time\nt implies the existence of the time inversion transformation T\u0302 defined by\nthe action on the generalized canonical coordinates (let us recall that the\nvelocity y is also considered as a coordinate in the Hilbert space approach\nto deterministic systems),\n(x, y) \u2212\u2192 (x, \u2212y).\nInvariance of the canonical quantization implies the transformation\n(P\u0302x , P\u0302y ) \u2212\u2192 (\u2212P\u0302x , P\u0302y ),\nbecause the time inversion is an anti-unitary transformation on the Hilbert\nspace ([11]). A similar transformation for the classical momentum holds.\nWe remark that the consistency of this splitting of the cotangent space\nT\u2217 TM is based on the existence of an additional geometric structure associated with the time inversion T\u0302 . This additional structure breaks again the\n14\n\n\fsymmetry of the Hamiltonian,\nO(6) \u00d7 O(6) \u2212\u2192 O 2 (3) \u00d7 O 2 (3).\nBecause the physical system is deterministic and has a well defined momentum and generalized position values, it is in a particular defined state.\nThe evolution of these states are in one to one correspondence with the\n1 (1), \u03b2 2 (1), \u03b2 3 (1), \u03b2 1 (1), \u03b2 2 (1), \u03b2 3 (1)) describing the evolution of\n1-form (\u03b2\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1 (2), \u03b2 2 (2), \u03b2 3 (2), \u03b2 1 (2), \u03b2 2 (2), \u03b2 3 (2)) for the second\nthe first pair and (\u03b2\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(the notation \u00b1 corresponds to the splitting induced by time inversion in\nTx M). But when the system follows the evolution guided by a particular\nvalue of the above forms the symmetry is again broken,\nO2 (3) \u00d7 O 2 (3) \u2212\u2192 O 2 (2) \u00d7 O 2 (2).\nThe final group O 2 (2) \u00d7 O2 (2) is because is the biggest group preserving a\nparticular deterministic evolution.\nTherefore it is not possible that the system could hold a non-trivial irreducible representation of the rotation group SO(3) consistent with a deterministic evolution: the symmetry group for a defined system of two correlated pair of particles at the Planck scale is O 2 (2) \u00d7 O 2 (2). This group is\nnot enough to contain the rotation group SO(3)\nTheorem 3.4 For a deterministic system composed by two correlated, identical pairs of associated particles with energies at the Planck scale, there is\nnot a non-trivial irreducible representation of the rotation group leaving invariant the deterministic evolution defined by particular values of the beta\nfunction.\nOne consequence of this fact is that the ordinary proof of Bell's inequalities\nfor spin does not hold at the Planck scale for this system. The reason is that\nthe proof uses the rotation symmetry and it does not hold for deterministic\nsystems at this scale. Even the notion of spin is not truly defined in this\ncontext. Therefore the claim is that Bell's inequalities for spin does not hold\nfor Deterministic Finslerian Models.\nAt ordinary energies the breaking O2 (3)\u00d7O2 (3) \u2212\u2192 O 2 (2)\u00d7O2 (2) is not\ngiven. Only at high energies of order of the Planck scale we can expect this\nbreak because it means that the system can not decouple from the ambient\nin a way that rotation transformations of the system have sense. However at\nordinary scales this decoupling have indeed sense and the above symmetry\nbreak does not hold.\n15\n\n\fThis possible absence of was anticipated by 't Hooft and is independent\nof the nature of the model, finslerian or not. Here we remark the geometric\ncharacter of this phenomenon in the case of Finslerian deterministic models.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe relations between the Finsler structure (TM, F \u2217 ) and the Riemannian\nstructure (TM, h) is described in reference [10] (indeed it was considered\nthe case of a general, smooth manifold M). In addition, it was shown the\nexistence of a map from the category of Finsler spaces to the category of Riemannian spaces mapping the Chern connection of F (generally, any linear\nconnection living in \u03c0 \u2217 M) to a linear connection on \u03c0 \u2217 TM and the hhcurvature to the curvature of this linear connection. These transformations\ncan be interpreted as \"average\" operations of the Finsler structures and objects. The physical interpretation of these averages is that the Finsler structure living in the phase space manifold T\u2217 TM evolves after a long term\nto the equilibrium described by the Riemannian structure (TM, h). This\nRiemannian structure describes the geometry of the phase space when the\nsystem of all ontological states reach the equilibrium. However, the Hamiltonian describing the evolution of the averaged system when the system has\nevolved after a long term is not the Hamiltonian coming from the \"average\" Finsler structure (TM, h) (that is indeed Riemannian). The reason\nis because these averaged physical systems are not systems of fundamental\nparticles at the Planck scale, but could be composite objects like strings.\nSince they do not feel times so small as the Planck time Lp /c, the Hamiltonian guiding their dynamics is the average Hamiltonian < \u0124 >, not the\ndeterministic Hamiltonian based on the geometric structure, Finslerian or\nRiemannian.\nWhen the system arrives to the equilibrium the Finsler structure is just\nthe Riemannian structure (TM, h). From the definition of the fundamental\nor ontological Hamiltonian (3.6), we obtain in the equilibrium the condition\n\u0124 = 0.\nThe existence of macroscopic matter structures and gravity can be associated\nwith the following decomposition:\n\u0124 =< \u0124 > +\u03b4\u0124 = \u0124matter + \u03b4\u0124.\nIf we take the average on each member of this relation, one obtains at equi16\n\n\flibrium\n< \u0124 >=< < \u0124U > > + < \u03b4\u0124 >= \u0124matter + < \u03b4\u0124 >= 0.\nWe associate < \u0124U >= \u0124matter , < \u03b4\u0124 >= \u0124gravity . Therefore in this model\nthe distinction between matter and gravity appears as result of a long term\nevolution of the ontological states. Also it appears remarkable that while in\nequilibrium appears gravity to compensate matter, at non-equilibrium (that\nis when the structure is Finslerian) there is some kind of pre-gravity interaction, described by the Hamiltonian \u03b4\u0124. The qualitative characteristic of\nthis interaction should be study further. Matter seems identical (the particle\ncontent seems complete identical because the Hamiltonian for matter, before\nand after average is the same < \u0124). This fact implies the universality of our\nformalism in order to get any quantum system from a deterministic model.\nConnecting with 't Hooft theory, we describe in a geometric way the\nprojection from an ontological state to an equivalence class as follows:\nThe projection after a long term evolution of a deterministic system to the\nequilibrium equivalence class is described by the transformation that average\nthe dual Finsler structures living in the manifold T\u2217 TM.\nIt is a remarkable consequence of the finslerian 't Hooft models the prediction of the value of a maximal acceleration and speed for physical systems.\nThis can be interpreted as the requirement of the existence of two Natural constants by geometric consistency. In addition, the possible absence\nof Bell's inequalities for spin is a remarkable prediction for the general 't\nHooft models: these inequalities are the main obstructions for the construction of hidden variables theories. In the present paper we have showed that\nthe absence of Bell's inequalities is possible at the Planck scale, where not\ndecoupling of the system with the ambient is taken and even the notion\nof three dimensional rotations become unclear. This explanation is simultaneous with the prediction of the existence of pre-gravity interaction in a\nnatural way. Therefore, it is possible the construction of hidden variables\ntheories at this energy without the introduction of non-local actions and the\nmechanisms could be promoted by a pre-gravity interaction.\nThat all the 't Hooft models have a local geometric interpretation in\nterms of Finsler geometry and the geometric origin of a microscopic time arrow obtained from the geometric data, are the mayor goals of these models.\nIn addition we can motivate a deterministic model based in some construction of a Randers space containing interactions. Unfortunately the model is\n17\n\n\fnot completely defined by the geometry and physical hypothesis should be\nintroduced.\nWe start reviewing the treatment of 't Hooft of a deterministic system\nwith a dissipative dynamics ([1]). The Quantum Hamiltonian is:\n\u0124 = p~ * f~(~g ).\nConsider an scalar operator \u03c1(~q) such that [\u03c1(~q), \u0124]=0. Then we can perform\nthe following decomposition:\n\u0124 = \u01241 \u2212 \u01242 ;\nwith\n\u01241 =\n\n(4.1)\n\n1 2\n1 2\n(\u03c1 + \u0124)2 ; \u01242 =\n(\u03c1 \u2212 \u0124)2 .\n4\u03c1\n4\u03c1\n\nThis both Hamiltonian commute, [\u01241 , \u01242 ] = 0.\nIn order to bounded from below the complete Hamiltonian one can introduce the constrain than on physical states the following condition holds:\n\u0124|\u03c8 >\u2192 0.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThat should be understood as a long term evolution statement: the physical\nsystem evolves to states obeying condition (4.2). This constraint immediately implies the bound of the Hamiltonian:\n\u0124 \u2192 \u01241 \u2192 \u03c12 \u2265 0.\nThese constrains can be motivated first if we mimic the system in terms\nof a non-dissipative model and where the system correspond to a quantum\noscillator, where all the \"orbits\" are stable such that \u0124 = p~ * f~(~g ) holds and\nsuch that [Hs , \u03c12 ] = 0.\nThe stable orbits are restricted by the condition:\ne\u2212\u0124T |\u03c8 >= |\u03c8 >,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere T is the period of the orbit \u03c1 = 1. This condition, equivalent to the\nconstrain (4.2) and implies the limitation of trajectories to stable orbits at\nequilibrium.\n\n18\n\n\fLet us compare this construction with a parallel construction using Finslerian Models. One start directly with a classical Hamiltonian of the form\nH = F (~q, p~) \u2212 F (~q, \u2212~\np).\nAfter canonical quantization, we identify \u01241 = F (~q, p~) = \u03b1 + \u03b2; \u01242 =\nF (~\nq , p~) = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2.\nWe propose the constrain \u03c1 = 1 on physical states. It is equivalent to an\naverage operation defined in the following way:\nZ\ngij (x, y),\n(4.4)\nhij =\nS\n\nwhere the integration is done on the sphere S6N\u22121 \u2282 T\u2217 u Tx M.\nTaking this average in the underlying geometric structure corresponds to\nconstrain the values of the quantum states: after a long term evolution, the\nphysical states arrive to the sub-manifold S6N\u22121 .\nSuppose now the system composed by two identical elementary system,\nbeing their dynamics described by a deterministic Hamiltonian of the form\n(4.1). Let us suppose modeled on Randers spaces, so their Hamiltonian are\ndetermined by (\u03b11 , \u03b21 ) and (\u03b12 , \u03b22 ). The 1-forms \u03b2i , i = 1, 2. have norm less\nthan one by the corresponding Riemannian norms \u03b1i , i = 1, 2. There are\nat least two ways to produce a bigger Randers space using just the above\ngeometric data:\n1. The first way is valid for complete general structures\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12 ; \u03b2 = \u03b21 \u2295 \u03b22 .\nThis construction does not produce interaction terms in the total\nHamiltonian. There is a priori not relation \u03b11 \u03b12 .\n2. The second form recovers the impossibility for a external observer to\ndifferentiate between identical particles:\np~ = p~1 \u00d7 ~0 + ~0 \u00d7 ~p2 ; \u03b2~ = \u03b2~1 \u00d7 ~0 + ~0 \u00d7 \u03b2~2 ,\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2295 \u03b12 ; \u03b11 = \u03b12 .\nThe quantum total Hamiltonian is given by:\n\u0001\n~ p) = 1 \u03b2~1 (~\n\u03b2(~\np1 ) + \u03b2~1 (~\np2 ) + \u03b2~2 (~\np1 ) + \u03b2~2 (~\np2 ) .\n2\nThe mixed terms produce the interaction. The condition \u03b11 = \u03b12 is\nto ensure that the above construction is a Randers space.\n19\n\n\fIn order to conclude the discussion we would like to discuss our idea with\nsome recent applications of Finsler geometry in Physics ([6] and references\ntherein). Our application of Finsler geometry and in particular, of Randers\nspaces, seems new even if it contains elements that have been already used\nin other contests. It was performed considerable work on higher order mechanics and generalized Finsler spaces ([7]-[9] and also [6]), but the bird of\ndeterministic models at the Planck scale is very recent and the application of\nFinsler geometry presented in this paper is also new. In addition we remark\nthat we are not concern at this stage with a field theory for these deterministic systems, but with the general formalism that we could use to describe\nthem. Finsler geometry is rather intrincated complex with so many natural\nconnections for instance like Chern's or Cartan's connections. Also the notion of non-linear connection is of fundamental importance. But we are not\nconcern on these important topics in this paper because the construction\nproposed involves only notions at the metric level: our average is a universal procedure, valid for any linear connection \u03c0 \u2217 TM. Further research can\nbe provide a mechanism to select a right d-connection for a field theory of\ndeterministic degrees of freedom. In addition, some additional research is\nneeded to understand the extension of the average operation applied to the\nnon-linear connection.\n\nA\n\nBasic Results on Finsler Geometry for Deterministic Systems\n\nIn this appendix we recall the basic notions of Finsler geometry used in the\npresent work. The main reference for this appendix is [4]. We present the\nnotions for an arbitrary smooth manifold M.\nLet (x, U) be a local coordinate system over a point x \u2208 M, where x \u2208 U\nhave local coordinates (x1 , ..., xn ), U \u2282 M is an open set and TM is the\ntangent bundle. We use Einstein's convention for up and down equal indices\nin this work.\n\u2202\ni\nA tangent vector at the point x \u2208 M is denoted by y i \u2202x\ni \u2208 Tx M, y \u2208 R.\nWe also denote by TM the set of sections of the tangent bundle. We can\nidentify the point x with its coordinates (x1 , ..., xn ) and the tangent vector\ny \u2208 Tx M at x with its components y = (y 1 , ..., y n ). Then each local coordinate system (x, U) induces a local coordinate system in TM denoted\n\u2202\nby (x, y, U) such that y = y i \u2202x\ni \u2208 Tx M has local natural coordinates\n1\nn\n1\nn\n(x , ..., x , y , ..., y ).\nLet us denote by N = TM \\ {0}. The notion of a Finsler structure is\n20\n\n\fgiven through the following definition,\nDefinition A.1 A Finsler structure F on the manifold M is a non-negative,\nreal function F : TM \u2192 [0, \u221e[ such that\n1. It is smooth in the split tangent bundle N.\n2. Positive homogeneity holds: F (x, \u03bby) = \u03bbF (x, y) for every \u03bb > 0.\n3. Strong convexity holds: the Hessian matrix\ngij (x, y) :=\n\n1 \u2202 2 F 2 (x, y)\n2 \u2202y i \u2202y j\n\n(A.1)\n\nis positive definite in N.\nWe also denote by a finsler structure in M the pair (M, F ).\nThe minimal smoothness requirement for the Finsler structure is C 5 in N\nwhen second Bianchi identities are used; more generally only, C 4 differentiable structure is required. The matrix gij (x, y) is the matrix-components\nof the fundamental tensor g. The homogeneity condition can be more\nstrong: F (x, \u03bby) = |\u03bb|F (x, y). Then (M, F ) is called absolutely homogeneous Finsler structure.\nExample A.2 A Randers space is characterized by a Finsler function of\nthe form:\nF (x, y) = \u03b1(x, y) + \u03b2(x, y),\n(A.2)\nwhere \u03b1(x, y) = aij (x)y i y j is a Riemannian metric and \u03b2(x, y) = \u03b2i (x)y i .\nThe requirement of being gij positive definite implies that the 1-form (\u03b21 , ..., \u03b2n )\nis bounded, using the above Riemannian metric \u03b1. Examples of Randers\nspaces can be found for instance in [4] and [5].\nDefinition A.3 ([4]) Let (M, F ) be a Finsler structure and (x, y, U) a local\ncoordinate system induced on TM from the coordinate system (x, U) of M.\nThe Cartan tensor components are defined by the set of functions:\nAijk =\n\nF \u2202gij\n,\n2 \u2202y k\n\ni, j, k = 1, ..., n.\n\n(A.3)\n\nThese coefficients are homogeneous of degree zero in (y 1 , ..., y n ). In the Riemannian case Aijk are zero and this fact characterizes Riemannian geometry\nfrom other types of Finsler geometries (Deicke's theorem).\n21\n\n\fSince the components of the fundamental and Cartan's tensors have a\ndependence on the tangent vector y, it is natural to use other manifold than\nM to study Finsler geometry. One possible construction is the following:\nconsider \u03c0 \u2217 TM, the pull back bundle of TM by the projection\n\u03c0 : N \u2212\u2192 M.\n\n(A.4)\n\nThe vector bundle \u03c0 \u2217 TM has as base manifold N, the fiber over the point\nu = (x, y) \u2208 N is diffeomorphic to Tx M for every point u \u2208 N with \u03c0(u) = x\nand the structure group is diffeomorphic to GL(n, R).\nThe vector bundle \u03c0 \u2217 TM \u2282 TM \u00d7 N and the projection on the first and\nsecond factors are given by\n\u03c01 : \u03c0 \u2217 TM \u2212\u2192 N,\n\n(A.5)\n\n\u03c02 : \u03c0 \u2217 TM \u2212\u2192 TM.\n\n(A.6)\n\n\u03c0 \u2217 TM is completely determined as a subset of TM \u00d7 N by the following\nrelation; for every u \u2208 N and \u03be \u2208 \u03c01\u22121 (u),\n(u, \u03be) \u2208 \u03c0 \u2217 TM iff\n\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c02 (u, \u03be) = \u03c0(u).\n\n(A.7)\n\nA similar construction \u03c0 \u2217 TM can be performed over SM, the sphere bundle\nover N.\nOne essential notion in Finsler geometry is the non-linear connection.\nWe introduce the non-linear connection coefficients, defined by the formula\nr s\nk\nNji\ni y\nk y y\n= \u03b3jk\n\u2212 Aijk \u03b3rs\n,\nF\nF\nF F\n\ni, j, k, r, s = 1, ..., n\n\ni are defined in local\nwhere the formal second kind Christoffel's symbols \u03b3jk\ncoordinates by the formula\n\n\u2202gjk\n\u2202gsj\n1\n\u2202gsk\ni\n\u03b3jk\n= gis ( k \u2212\n+\n),\ns\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202xj\n\ni, j, k = 1, ..., n;\nNi\n\nAijk = gil Aljk and g il glj = \u03b4ji . Note that the coefficients Fj are invariant\nunder the scaling y \u2192 \u03bby, \u03bb \u2208 R+ , y \u2208 Tx M.\nLet us consider the local coordinate system (x, y, U) of the manifold TM.\nA tangent basis for Tu N, u \u2208 N is defined by the distributions([4]):\n{\n\n\u03b4\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b4\n|u , ..., n |u , F 1 |u , ..., F n |u },\n1\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4x\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n22\n\n\f\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b4\n|u =\n|u \u2212 Nji i |u ,\n\u03b4xj\n\u2202xj\n\u2202y\n\ni, j = 1, ..., n.\n\nThe set of local sections { \u03b4x\u03b4 1 |u , ..., \u03b4x\u03b4n |u , u \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (x), x \u2208 U} generates\nthe local horizontal distribution HU while { \u2202y\u2202 1 |u , ..., \u2202y\u2202n |u , u \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (x), x \u2208\nU} the vertical distribution VU . The subspaces Vu and Hu are such that the\nfollowing splitting of Tu N holds:\nTu N = Vu \u2295 Hu , \u2200 u \u2208 N.\nThis decomposition is invariant by the action of GL(n, R) and it defines\na non-linear connection (a connection in the sense of Ehresmann) on the\nprincipal fiber bundle N(M, GL(n, R)).\nTheorem A.4 (Chern's connection, [4]) Let (M, F ) be a Finsler structure.\nThe vector bundle \u03c0 \u2217 TM admits a unique linear connection characterized by\nthe connection 1-forms {\u03c9ji , i, j = 1, ..., n} such that the following structure\nequations hold:\n1. \"Torsion free\" condition,\nd(dxi ) \u2212 dxj \u2227 wji = 0,\n\ni, j = 1, ..., n.\n\n(A.8)\n\n2.

Cartan's\nconnection is complete metric compatible, but have torsion. The relation\nbetween the Cartan connection 1-forms (\u03c9c )ki in relation with the Chern\nconnection \u03c9ik 1-forms are given by ([4]):\n(\u03c9c )ki = \u03c9ik + Akij\n\n\u03b4y j\n.\nF\n\nAt this point we should stressed the importance on physical applications\nof the Cartan connection and in general of the metric connections in field\ntheory ([6]). Chern's connection, not begin metric compatible is a bit problematic for physical applications, being preferible Cartan's connection or\nd-connection that are metric compatible.\n\n23\n\n\fThe manifold Ix is called indicatrix and is defined by\nIx := {y \u2208 Tx M | F (x, y) = 1}.\nLet us denote by F(Ix ) the set of real, smooth functions on the indicatrix\nIx . Then the average operation is defined as follows\nDefinition A.5 Let (M, F ) be a Finsler structure. Let f \u2208 F(Ix ) be a\nreal, smooth function defined on the indicatrix Ix and (\u03c8, Ix ) the invariant\nmeasure. We define the map\n< * >\u03c8 : F(Ix ) \u2212\u2192 R\nf (x, y) \u2212\u2192\n\n1\nvol(Ix )\n\nZ\n\ndvol \u03c8(x, y) f (x, y).\n\n(A.10)\n\nIx\n\nIn the case of smooth Finsler structures the coefficients {hij , i, j =\n1, .., n} are smooth in M. They are the components of a Riemannian metric\nin M,\nProposition A.6 Let (M, F ) be a Finsler structure. Then the functions\nhij (x) :=< gij (x, y) >,\n\n\u2200x\u2208M\n\n(A.11)\n\nare the components of a Riemannian metric in M such that in a local basis\n(x, U) is\nh(x) = hij dxi \u2297 dxj .\n(A.12)\nWe should mention that the restriction on the indicatrix Ix in the integration is not necessary: we can perform similar averages procedures on any\ncompact sub-manifold of co-dimension 1 and also of co-dimension 0 ([10],\nProposition 3.13 and Proposition 3.14). Indeed Proposition 3.14 implies\nwe can take the limit of the whole tangent bundle, provided a convenient\nnormalization is used.\nThe average operation can be extended to obtain average connections and\naverage curvatures ([10]). This fact can be used to introduce a field theory\nbased on connections as fundamental variables for deterministic theories at\nthe Planck scale.\n\n24\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Gerard't Hooft, Determinism and Dissipation in Quantum gravity,\nhep-th/0003005\n[2] Gerard't Hooft, How does God play dies?(Pre-) Determinism at the\nPlanck Scale, hep-th/0104219.\n[3] Gerard't Hooft The holographic principle, hep-th/0003004.\n[4] D.
