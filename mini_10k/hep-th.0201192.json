We show that the phase space of the resulting classical theory of bilinears, which are the mesonic operators of this theory, is OSp1(H|H)/U(H+ |H+ ),\nwhere H|H refers to the underlying complex graded space of combined one-particle\nstates of fermions and bosons and H+ |H+ corresponds to the positive frequency\nsubspace.

In the\nMajorana fermion case the phase space is given by O1 (H)/U(H+ ), where H refers\nto the complex one-particle states and H+ to its positive frequency subspace. The\nmeson spectrum in the linear approximation again obeys a variant of the 't Hooft\nequation. The linear approximation to the boson/fermion coupled case brings an\nadditonal bound state equation for mesons, which consists of one fermion and one\nboson, again of the same form as the well-known 't Hooft equation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGauge theories play a fundamental role in our description of nature. Nevertheless our understanding of confining phase of gauge theories is not so complete. In principle we should be\nable to calculate the hadronic spectrum starting from Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD),\n1\n\n\fwhich is a gauge theory, yet this has not been possible up to now. It is believed that\nthe hadrons are colorless excitations of the underlying gauge theory and we never see the\nconstituent quarks as free particles. This suggests that in this case we should have an independent formulation of gauge theories in terms of color singlet operators of the original\ngauge theory. In general this is a very hard task.\nGauge theories in 1 + 1 dimensions provide a great testing ground for many ideas about\nrealistic theories. This is a great simplification, various difficult problems of higher dimensional theories will not be there, yet there are still interesting aspects of these theories which\nmake them worth studying in depth. In [1] Rajeev has constructed a theory of mesons in\ntwo dimensions in the limit Nc , the number of colors in SU(Nc ), goes to infinity using only\nthe color invariant variables (which correspond to the meson operators). The idea that QCD\nshould simplify while keeping all its essential features in this limit goes back to 't Hooft[3, 4]\nand that this limit should be a kind of classical mechanics to Migdal and Witten [5]. This\nis a very promising step in simplifying gauge theories, but the large-Nc theory is also quite\ncomplicated and it is not possible as yet to understand it in four dimensions.\nOriginally 't Hooft studied two dimensional QCD in the large-Nc limit to understand the\nmeson spectrum and obtained his bound state equation in his seminal paper[4]. Soon after\nthe scalar two dimensional QCD was worked out by Shei and Tsao in [6] following 't Hooft,\nand later by Tomaras using Hamiltonian methods in [7]. These works obtained the analog of\nthe 't Hooft equation for this case. A natural extension of these would be to look at combined\n(fermionic) QCD and scalar QCD, this is done in a paper of Aoki[8] where it is shown that\nthree types of mesons are possible and they all obey a certain type of 't Hooft equation(see\nalso [9]). Cavicchi [10] using a path integral approach with bilocal fields, developed in [11],\nstudied coupled fermions and bosons as well as some other models in two dimensions and he\nobtained some generalized versions of the 't Hooft equation.\nTo understand gauge theories better, we study the problem of bosons and fermions coupled\nto SO(Nc ) gauge fields in 1 + 1 dimensions. We will apply the methods developed by Rajeev\nto this toy model. We recommend his lectures for a more detailed exposition of the underlying\nideas and various other directions [12]. In [1] it was shown that the phase space of the two\ndimensional QCD is an infinite dimensional Grassmannian[13]. Using the same methods\nscalar version of QCD is worked out in [14],the phase space of the theory comes out to be\nan infinite dimensional disc. Recently Konechny and the second author obtained the largeNc phase space of bosons and fermions coupled to SU(Nc ) gauge theory; a certain kind of\nsuper-Grassmannian [15]. The linearized equations agree with the ones found in [8]. The\ncorrect equations are nonlinear and various approximation schemes are also discussed in [15].\nThere are some ideas in the literature which suggest that gauge theories in two dimensions\nall behave in a very similar way[16], therefore it will be interesting to see how much of this\nholds for SO(Nc ) gauge theory.\nThe organization of our work is as follows, since we did not want to go into technical\ndetails of super-geometry immediately, we first study the purely fermionic case. The essential\ncalculations are very similar to the ones in Rajeev's lectures[12] and for the geometry basic\nideas are already in [17, 13], we also recommend the article [18] for a good discussion. We\nshow that one can formulate the large-Nc limit in terms of bilinears along the lines in [1].\nWe obtain a variant of the 't Hooft equation in the linear approximation. We explain the\n2\n\n\fgeometry of the phase space and show that it is a homogeneous manifold, O1 (H)/U(H+ )(see\nexplanations in section IV), and the symplectic form is the natural one. In the second part,\nwe study the combined system of bosons and fermions, this part is very brief, we state mostly\nthe results. We obtain a super-Poisson structure of the bilinears in the large-Nc limit and\nthe resulting Hamiltonian. The equations of motion in the linear approximation agree with\nthe purely bosonic and purely fermionic ones with an additional one for the mesons made up\nof one fermion and one boson. This is again a variant of the well-known 't Hooft equation.\nThe discussion on the geometry of the resulting infinite dimensional supersymplectic space\nrequires some new ideas. This part is technically complicated, we use essentially Berezin's\nideas [19], but we do not claim that all the technicalities of the infinite dimensional case is\nunderstood. We show that the underlying phase space should be the super-homogeneous\nmanifold OSp1 (H|H)/U(H+ |H+ ), and the supersymplectic form is the natural one on this\nspace. We plan to come to the more mathematical aspects of this problem in a future\npublication.\n\n2\n\nThe SO(Nc ) Majorana Fermions in the Light-cone\n\nSince the basic philosophy was explained in [1] we can be brief and only state our conventions\nand define our theory. We will use the light cone coordinates x+ = \u221a12 (t+ x), x\u2212 = \u221a12 (t\u2212x),\n(we recommend [20] for an introduction to light-cone quantization, and [21] for a more\ncomprehensive review), the action functional is\nS=\n\nZ\n\n1\n[ TrF\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + i\u03a8\u0304M \u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc + gA\u03bc )\u03a8M \u2212 m\u03a8\u0304M \u03a8M ],\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have an SO(Nc ) gauge theory for which the matter fields are in the fundamental\nrepresentation and Tr denotes an invariant inner product in the Lie algebra. The Lie algebra\ncondition for SO(Nc) implies that AT\u03bc = \u2212A\u03bc . To compute the variations of the action\nwe need the independent degress of freedom, we can expand A\u03bc = Aa\u03bc T a where T a are the\ngenerators of the Lie algebra of SO(Nc ), chosen such that TrT a T b = \u2212 12 \u03b4 ab . Our conventions\nfor the Majorana fermions are as follows: we choose the Majorana representation in which\nthe fermions are real, i. e. \u03a8\u2020M = \u03a8TM (transpose here also includes the color indices to\nsimplify the notation). The gamma matrices now are given by,\n0\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u2212i\ni 0\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u2212i\n\u2212i 0\n\n\u0013\n\n5\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22121 0\n.\n0 1\n\n(2)\n\nNote that \u03b3 5 happens to be diagonal in 1 + 1 dimensions and we set \u03a8\u0304M = \u03a8TM \u03b3 0 . We now\nrewrite the action in the light-cone\ncoordinates and eliminate all nondynamical degrees of\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c81\n, and use \u03b3 + = \u221a12 (\u03b3 0 + \u03b3 1 ), \u03b3 \u2212 = \u221a12 (\u03b3 0 \u2212 \u03b3 1 ). We further\nfreedom. We write \u03a8M =\n\u03c82\nset A\u2212 = 0 and choose x+ as the evolution variable, which we call \"time\".\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\ndx+ dx\u2212 [ (\u2202\u2212 Aa+ )2 + i 2\u03c81T \u2202\u2212 \u03c81 + i 2\u03c82T \u2202+ \u03c82 + i2m\u03c81T \u03c82 + i 2g\u03c82T Aa+ T a \u03c82 ], (3)\n2\n3\n\n\f(from now on T only means tranpose in the color space). We note also that we have a real\ntwo component fermion, they are Grassmann valued obeying \u03c81 \u03c82 = \u2212\u03c82 \u03c81 . We can check\nthat the action is real if we use the following complex conjugation convention for spinors,\n(\u03c8\u03be)\u2217 = \u03be \u2217 \u03c8 \u2217 . We see that \u03c81\u03b1 is non-dynamical, and hence can be eliminated using its\nequation of motion,\nm\n\u03c81\u03b1 = \u2212 \u221a\n\u03c82\u03b1 .\n(4)\n2\u2202\u2212\nSimilarly we solve for the nondynamical Aa+ , and get\n\u221a\ni 2g T a\na\n(5)\nA+ = 2 \u03c82 T \u03c82 .\n\u2202\u2212\nA remark is in order here to clarify what we mean by 'real fermions' while the action and the\nconstraint equation for Aa+ have explicit factors of i. The resolution of this seeming paradox\nis that it is the equations of motion which are actually real. To see this note first that the\nsymplectic form has a factor of i in it, and the \u03c81\u03b1 constraint only has real operators. The\nAa+ constraint is also real if we choose complex conjugation of fermions to be (\u03c8\u03be)\u2217 = \u03be \u2217\u03c8 \u2217 .\nThis convention implies that the product of two real fermions is imaginary, and this is the\nreason for the extra factors of i in the action. The equation of motion for \u03c82\u03b1 reads,\nm\n\u2202+ \u03c82\u03b1 = \u221a \u03c81\u03b1 ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is manifestly real. This shows that the \"time\" evolution preserves the real valuedness\ncondition imposed on the fermions.\nIf we insert the above constraints into the action we arrive at\n\u221a 2\nZ\n\u221a\n2m\n1\n1\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c82\n\u03c82 \u2212 g 2 \u03c82T T a \u03c82 2 \u03c82T T a \u03c82 ].\nS = dx dx [i 2\u03c82 \u2202+ \u03c82 \u2212\n(7)\n2\ni\u2202\u2212\n\u2202\u2212\nThis defines our theory at the classical level with the redundant degrees of freedom eliminated. Since it is written entirely in terms of \u03c82 we will refer to this field as \u03c8 from now\non. The real fermions have a super-poisson bracket, which can be read off from the action,\ngiven by\n\u2212i\n{\u03c8 \u03b1 (x\u2212 , x+ ), \u03c8 \u03b2 (y \u2212 , x+ )}+ = \u221a \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 ).\n(8)\n2 2\nSince our real fermions are Grassmann valued we use a symplectic structure which is i times\na real symmetric operator, and the Hamiltonian is actually i times an antisymmetric one,\nas we will see in more detail in the next section. There is an ambiguity in the quantization,\nwe follow Rajeev's original approach[12, 1], we will remove the nondynamical fields after\nquantizing the dynamical field, \u03c8 \u03b1 . Using the Dirac rule we get an anticommutator for \u03c8,\nh\u0304\n\u2212i\n[\u03c8 \u03b1 (x\u2212 ), \u03c8 \u03b2 (y \u2212 )]+ = ih\u0304( \u221a \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 )) = \u221a \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 ).\n2 2\n2 2\n\n(9)\n\n(Note that for the orthogonal group, the distinction of upper and lower indices is irrelevant,\nsince the metric tensor is unity). The reason for our convention of complex conjugation is to\n4\n\n\farrive at this more familiar form of the Clifford algebra. We could have chosen a convention\nin which the product of real fermions is real, then we would arrive at a Clifford algebra\nwith a factor of i as in [17], but this usual form is preferable (it leads to a positive inner\nproduct, or the hermitian conjugation is compatible with the inner product in the fermionic\nFock space). Let us introduce the Fourier decomposition, which is done in a complex Hilbert\ndp\nspace (to simplify notation we drop the subscript in p\u2212 , set h\u0304 = 1 and [dp] = 2\u03c0\n),\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c8 (x ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n[dp] \u03b1\n\u2212\n\u03c7 (p)e\u2212ipx .\n3/4\n2\n\n(10)\n\n(To be precise, in the above expansion, we should assume a cut-off \u01eb0 around zero momentum,\nto be taken to zero at the end of our calculations). We see that \u03c7\u03b1 (p) satisfies the basic\nanticommutator,\n[\u03c7\u03b1 (p), \u03c7\u03b2 (q)]+ = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4[p + q],\n(11)\nwhere we write \u03b4[p \u2212 q] = 2\u03c0\u03b4(p \u2212 q). Real valuedness of the original field implies that\n\u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p) = \u03c7\u03b1 (\u2212p). In standard physics notation the expansion would be written as\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c8 (x ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n[\u03c7\u03b1 (p)e\u2212ipx + \u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)eipx ]\n\n[dp]\n.\n23/4\n\n(12)\n\nAs well known in the physics literature, to make the Hamiltonian bounded from below, we\nshould choose a vacuum to be used to construct a fermion Fock space, and further impose a\nnormal ordering prescription. This is done by simply requiring that \u03c7\u03b1 (p)|0 >= 0 for p > 0,\nand defining\n(\n\u2212\u03c7\u03b2 (q)\u03c7\u03b1 (p) if p > 0, q < 0,\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n.\n(13)\n: \u03c7 (p)\u03c7 (q) :=\n\u03c7\u03b1 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (q) otherwise\nThis can be stated in one formula as,\n1\n: \u03c7\u03b1 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (q) := \u03c7\u03b1 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (q) \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4[p + q][1 + sgn(p)].\n2\n\n(14)\n\nFor most of our calculations we need only the bilinears and the above expressions. (For the\nHamiltonian we actually need the normal ordering of product of four such operators, and\nit is defined as usual all the annihilation operators are to be taken to the right of creation\noperators, it will be briefly explained later on). We can reduce our Hamiltonian after this\nquantization process, and we get,\n\u221a\nZ\n\u0010 2 2\n\u0011\ng2\n\u2212 m\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 1\nH = dx\n\u03c8 : \u2212 : \u03c8 \u03b1 (x\u2212 )\u03c8 \u03b2 (x\u2212 ) : |x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 | : \u03c8 \u03b2 (y \u2212 )\u03c8 \u03b1 (y \u2212 ) : . (15)\n:\u03c8\n2\ni\u2202\u2212\n2\nAbove we used (T a )\u03b1\u03b2 (T a )\u03bb\u03c3 = \u2212 12 (\u03b4 \u03b1\u03c3 \u03b4 \u03b2\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03bb \u03b4 \u03b2\u03c3 ) and the Green function 21 |x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 | =\n\u22122\n\u2202\u2212\n\u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212y \u2212 ). The last normal orderings can be rearranged to act only on the color invariant\ncombinations in the large-Nc limit, we will discuss this in the next section.\nNext we introduce the algebra of color invariant bilinears and study the resulting system\nin the large-Nc limit following [1, 12].\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nClassical mechanics of color invariant operators\n\nWe define color invariant bilinears as in [1, 12, 15] to be our dynamical variables and find\nthe large-Nc limit by postulating Poisson algebra of these bilinears and defining the phase\nspace to be a manifold where these Poisson brackets make sense. Since the theory is superrenormalizable we expect this to be related to the Hilbert-Schmidt ideal condition which is\nwell-known in the literature on the Fock spaces[13, 22, 23, 24]. We will see these aspects in\nmore detail in the next section when we talk about the geometry of the phase space. We\ndefine our basic dynamical variables, bilinears,\n2 X \u03b1\nR\u0302(p, q) =\n: \u03c7 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (q) :,\n(16)\nNc \u03b1\nwhich are color invariant combinations of the fermion operators. We find it useful to define\na related operator, F\u0302 (p, q) = R\u0302(\u2212p, q), we will see that this is the correct variable for\nthe geometry of the phase space. We assume that there are proper large-Nc limits of our\noperators, then they become classical variables when they are restricted to color invariant\nsector of the full Fock space. Following [1], we postulate the following Poisson brackets(we\nchoose the quantization parameter to be N1c ),\n\u0010\n\n{R(p, q), R(s, t)} = \u22122i R(p, t)\u03b4[q + s] \u2212 R(q, t)\u03b4[p + s] + R(s, p)\u03b4[q + t] \u2212 R(s, q)\u03b4[p + t]\n\u0011\n\n+ (\u03b4[q + t]\u03b4[p + s] \u2212 \u03b4[p + t]\u03b4[q + s])(sgn(t) + sgn(s)) .\n\nOur dynamical system is not defined completely yet, since there is still a left over global\ncolor invariance, generated by\nQ\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nZ\n\n[dp] : \u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (p) :=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n[dp]\u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (p) \u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n[dp]\u03c7\u03b2\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (p).\n\n(17)\n\nThe commutators of these generators satisfy the Lie algebra of SO(Nc ).\nIf we restrict ourselves to the color invariant states, we find a constraint equation satisfied\nin the large-Nc limit, which can be best expressed in terms of F (p, q) = R(\u2212p, q),\nZ\n\n[dq]F (p, q)F (q, s) \u2212 sgn(p)F (p, s) \u2212 F (p, s)sgn(s) = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nWe define \u01eb(p, q) = \u2212sgn(p)\u03b4[p \u2212q], then we can rewrite this constraint as a simple quadratic\noperator equation,\n(F + \u01eb)2 = 1,\n(19)\n(we interpret F, \u01eb as integral kernels acting on L2 space of initial data). In the next section\nwe will analyze the geometric meaning of these constraints. The Hamiltonian and the above\nPoisson brackets determine the evolution of our classical system; the Poisson brackets are\nconsistent with the constraint equation.\nThe large-Nc Hamiltonian is obtained by dividing the original Hamiltonian by Nc and\nrewriting it in terms of our large-Nc variables. After certain manipulations which are sketched\nbelow, we obtain the following Hamiltonian,\nH=P\n\nZ\n\n1 2 g 2 [dp]\ng2\n(m \u2212 )\nR(\u2212p, p) \u2212 F P\n8\n2\u03c0 p\n64\n\nZ\n6\n\n[dpdqdsdt]\nR(p, q)R(s, t)\u03b4[p + q + s + t], (20)\n(p + s)2\n\n\fwhere P and F P refer to the principal\nvalue and\nfinite part\nprescriptions, respectively. In\nR\nR\nR\nthe following we will often write short for P and F P , but one should keep in mind\nthat these regularization perscriptions are used to define the singular integrals. The main\nsteps of the derivation of the above Hamiltonian are very similar to the one in [12], although\nthere are some small differences. Here we supply the basic ingredients to helpR the reader: for\n\u221e\nsimplicity in many places we write x, y instead of x\u2212 , y \u2212 , we define \u01eb(z) = P \u2212\u221e\nsgn(p)e+ipz ,\nnote the sign of the exponent. We have the vacuum expectation value of our field product,\n1\n< 0|\u03c8 \u03b1 (x\u2212 )\u03c8 \u03b2 (y \u2212 )|0 >= \u221a [\u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 ) \u2212 \u01eb(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 )].\n4 2\n\n(21)\n\nR\n\nAn important formula for the reduction is given in [12]: If f (x, y) = [dpdq]eipx+iqy f \u0303(p, q),\nZ\n\n1\n\u01eb(x \u2212 y)|x \u2212 y|f (x, y) = \u2212 P\n\u03c0\n\nWe also have |x\u2212y| = F P\nproducts,\n: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (x) ::\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nR\n\n[dp] ip(x\u2212y)\ne\n.\np2\n\nZ\n\n[dp]  \u0303\nf (\u2212p, p).\np\n\n(22)\n\nWe use a form of Wick's theorem for normal ordered\n\n\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) :=: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) : + < 0|\u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y)|0 >: \u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) :\n< 0|\u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)|0 >: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y) : \u2212 < 0|\u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)|0 >: \u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y) :\n< 0|\u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y)|0 >: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) : + < 0|\u03c8 \u03b1(x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y)|0 >< 0|\u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)|0 >\n< 0|\u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y)|0 >< 0|\u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)|0 >\n\nNote that when we take the large-Nc limit we can expand the full normal ordering in the\nleading order to get : \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y) :: \u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) :. In the above equality the fourth and fifth\nterms on the right are of smaller order in the large-Nc limit as well as the last term in the\nequality. The sixth term is an infinite vacuum expectation value, but that is a constant term\nwhich will not contribute to the equations of motion hence we can drop it. As a result,\n: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (x) :: \u03c8 \u03b2 (y)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y) :=: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y) :: \u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) :\n+ < 0|\u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y)|0 >: \u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y) : + < 0|\u03c8 \u03b2 (x)\u03c8 \u03b2 (y)|0 >: \u03c8 \u03b1 (x)\u03c8 \u03b1 (y) :\nUsing the above formulae we get a finite renormalization of the mass term.\nLet us compute the equations of motion at the linear approximation. What we mean by\nthis is to linearize the constraint as well as the equations of motion. The linearization of the\nconstraint simply says that R(u, v) = 0 if u, v have different signs. We thus restrict ourselves\nto u, v > 0 and compute\n\u2202R(u, v; x+ )\n= {R(u, v; x+ ); H},\n(23)\n\u2202x+\n+\nWe also put P = u + v, x = u/P and make the ansatz R(u, v; x+ ) = \u03b6R (x)e\u2212iP+ x . For\nfurther details we refer to the previous works [1, 12] where similar calculations are done in\nmore detail with the same type of ansatz; this yields an eigenvalue equation,\n\u03bc2 \u03b6R (x) = (m2 \u2212\n\ng2 h 1\ng2\n1 i\n\u03b6R (x) \u2212\n) +\n2\u03c0 x 1 \u2212 x\n8\u03c0\n7\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndy\n\n\u03b6R(y) \u2212 \u03b6R (1 \u2212 y)\n,\n(y \u2212 x)2\n\n(24)\n\n\fwhere \u03bc2 = 2P+ P is the invariant mass of the excitation. By looking at the behaviour of\nthis equation under x 7\u2192 1 \u2212 x, and y 7\u2192 1 \u2212 y, we see that we can choose our wave functions\nto be antisymmetric under y 7\u2192 1 \u2212 y, thus \u03b6(1 \u2212 y) = \u2212\u03b6(y). This gives us,\ng2\n1 i\ng2 h 1\n\u03b6R (x) \u2212\n) +\n\u03bc \u03b6R (x) = (m \u2212\n2\u03c0 x 1 \u2212 x\n4\u03c0\n2\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\ndy\n\n\u03b6R (y)\n.\n(y \u2212 x)2\n\n(25)\n\nThis equation is one of our main results and it is a variant of the well-known 't Hooft\nequation. Apart from the numerical factors this equation is the same as the original one,\nand this result fits to the ideas in [16]. Its properties are well known, the most important\none is that there are only bound state solutions.\nAn interesting question is the existence of \"baryon\" like excitations. These should correspond to operators of the form\n1\n\u01eb\u03b1 \u03b1 ...\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b11 \u2020 (p1 )\u03c7\u03b12 \u2020 (p2 )...\u03c7\u03b1Nc \u2020 (pNc ),\nZ 1 2 Nc\n\n(26)\n\nbut the meaning of these operators as Nc \u2192 \u221e is not so obvious. Yet we can think about\nnormalized states of this form when all the momenta are positive acting on the Fock vacuum,\nthey should correspond such baryon like states. Perhaps our large-Nc theory can detect their\npresence. Indeed, one can check that the operator,\nB\u0302 =\n\n1\nNc\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\n[dp]\u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (p),\n\n(27)\n\nmeasures the number of such excitations. This operator can be given a meaning Rin our theory:\nin the large-Nc limit therefore it is natural to expect that the operator, B = 12 0\u221e [dp]F (p, p)\ngives us this number and as we will see it is well-defined. In our classical limit we can ask if\nthis number makes sense for our system, that is if it is a conserved quantity. The answer, not\nsurprisingly, is no: the above baryon number is not conserved by our equations of motion.\nThus there are really no baryons in this theory.\n\n4\n\nGeometry of the Phase space\n\nTo understand the geometry behind the classical system that we introduce in the previous\nsection, we must take a look at the finite dimensional orthogonal group. Our approach will\nbe similar to one in [2] where we discussed the bosonic version of this theory. The basic\nideas of the quantization of free Weyl fermions and the underlying geometry is discussed in\nthe paper of Bowick and Rajeev [17], but we would like to expand on it and there are some\ndifferences in our conventions.\nWe recall that the real orthogonal group can be defined as the set of linear transformations\nwhich leave a quadratic form invariant.\nQ(Au, Av) = Q(u, v),\n\n(28)\n\n(here Q(u, v) = uT Qv represents this quadratic form, and superscript T denotes the ordinary\ntranspose). In our case the quadratic form is diagonal, so it is the standard inner product\n8\n\n\fuT v. We work with the complexification of the original real Hilbert space, and if our Hilbert\nspace is even dimensional, in this complex space we can use a different quadratic form, simply\nby using an invertible transformation S, Q2 = S T QS. Assume now that we have a complex\nstructure J acting on our original real Hilbert space, that is, a real antisymmetric matrix\nwith respect to this form, which is also orthogonal, implying\nJ\u00132 = \u22121. If the quadratic form\n\u0012\n0 1\nin an appropriate basis of the\nis the identity, we may think of such a matrix as J =\n\u22121 0\nreal Hilbert space. Let us split our Hilbert space into two isomorphic pieces with respect to\nthe above decomposition of the complex structure, W \u2295 W\u0303 , and complexify the real Hilbert\nspace, naturally we have W \u2297 C \u2295 W\u0303 \u2297 C. Choose with respect to this decomposition,\nS=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\ni1 \u2212i1\n.\n1\n1\n\n(29)\n\nThis is the transform which we can use to diagonalize our complex structure. Of course our\noriginal quadratic form now changes as we described above: we get,\nQ=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n0 1\n.\n1 0\n\n(30)\n\n(In our problem we actually transform the inverse of this form, but one can see that as\nmatrices these two forms are identical). The complex orthogonal group is the set of\ntrans\u0013\n\u0012\na b\nformations which leaves the form Q invariant. Thus a general complex matrix g =\nc d\nis orthogonal if,\naT c = \u2212cT a aT d + cT b = 1 bT d = \u2212dT b.\n(31)\nIn finite dimensions the quadratic form is Q(z, z) = z1 zm+1 + z2 zm+2 + ... + zm z2m . We see\nthen that the original real orthogonal group is embeded into the complex orthogonal group\ndefined by this quadratic form as a set of matrices\ng=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\na b\n,\nb\u0304 \u0101\n\n(32)\n\nwith now a, b satisfying, aT \u0101 + b\u2020 b = 1 and aT b\u0304 = \u2212b\u2020 a (where we decomposed the matrix in\nthe obvious way). This explicitly\u0012shows that\nthe complex structure, which is a real orthogonal\n\u0013\n\u2212i1 0\n. In our physical example these diagonalizations\nmatrix, becomes diagonal, J =\n0\ni1\nwill be accomplished by the Fourier transform.\nAn immediate consequence of this way of looking at the real orthogonal group is that the\nreal orthogonal\n\u0013 actually carries a copy of the unitary group in it, corresponding to\n\u0012 group\na 0\n. The quadratic form implies aT \u0101 = 1, as well as aa\u2020 = 1, this implies\nthe elements,\n0 \u0101\naa\u2020 = a\u2020 a = 1. It is the unitary group of H+ , where H+ refers to the subspace on which J\nacts as i.\nFor our purposes we should extend these discussions to the infinite dimensional case. In\nthe infinite dimensional one we should not use the full orthogonal group but the one with\na convergence condition[17]. This condition is the well-known Hilbert-Schmidt condition\n9\n\n\fin the quasi-free representations of canonical anticommutation algebra. We will comment\nfurther on the convergence conditions when we make contact with our system. We define\nthe restricted orthogonal group on the complexified Hilbert space as follows,\nO1 (H) = {g T Qg = Q|g =\n\n\u0012\n\na b\nb\u0304 \u0101\n\n\u0013\n\nb \u2208 I2 },\n\n(33)\n\nwhere I2 is the ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt operators [25].\nWe can\nstate the convergence con\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\nwith respect to the above\ndition more economically as [\u01eb, g] \u2208 I2 , where \u01eb =\n0 \u22121\ndecomposition. This is basically the complex structure we had, except that a factor of i\nhas been removed. The Lie algebra of this group can be found from an infinitesimal group\nelement,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nS\nR\n,\n(34)\ng = 1 + i\u2206u = 1 + i\u2206\n\u2212R\u0304 \u2212S\u0304\nwith RT = \u2212R and S \u2020 = S and \u2206 represents an infinitesimal parameter. The reader can\nverify that uT Q + Qu = 0. We would like to define a classical phase space using this infinite\ndimensional orthogonal group. This will be our phase space for the large-Nc theory, but for\nthe moment let us define it as a mathematical system. We introduce a variable \u03a6,\n\u03a6 = g\u01ebg \u22121\n\ng \u2208 O1 (H).\n\n(35)\n\nThe orbit of \u01eb under the restriced orthogonal group is parametrized by this operator. It is\neasy to see that the orbit is diffeomorphic to\nO1 (H)/U(H+ ).\n\n(36)\n\nThe operator \u03a6 satisfies,\n\u03a62 = 1\n\n\u03a6 = \u2212Q\u22121 \u03a6T Q\n\n\u03a6\u2212\u01eb=\n\n\u0012\n\nI1\nI2\n\nI2\nI1\n\n\u0013\n\n(37)\n\nwhere I1 denotes the trace class operators in the appropriate space of operators( here Q\u22121\nis identical to Q as a matrix, but transforms differently). The second condition really says\nthat \u03a6 is in the Lie algebra of this group (it is possible to think of this space as a real subset\nof the restricted Grassmanian, and there is an analogous construction of a line-bundle on\nthis space, see [26]). The tangent space of this orbit is given by the infinitesimal action of\nthe group at any point, and in fact it is a copy of the Lie algebra of this group at every\npoint. The action of a vector field on the basic variable \u03a6 becomes Vu (\u03a6) = i[u(\u03a6), \u03a6], for\na Lie algebra element u(\u03a6), which changes differentiably over the orbit. So a vector field at\na point \u03a6 = g\u01ebg \u22121 comes from a Lie algebra element g \u22121u(\u03a6)g.\nIt is well-known [27] that such orbits in finite dimensions typically carry a symplectic\nstructure. If we formally define a two form,\ni\n\u03a9 = Tr\u03a6d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6,\n4\n\n10\n\n(38)\n\n\ffollowing the methods in [1] we can check that it is closed and non-degenerate. The form\nevaluated at two vector fields Vu , Vv is given by\ni\n\u03a9(Vu , Vv ) = Tr\u01eb[[\u01eb, g \u22121 u(\u03a6)g], [\u01eb, g \u22121v(\u03a6)g]]\n8\n\n(39)\n\nwhich shows that it is well-defined, due to the Hilbert-Schmidt conditions, non-degenerate,\nhomogeneous and K\u00e4hler. The group action on this phase space \u03a6 7\u2192 g \u22121 \u03a6g is actually\nHamiltonian, that is there are moment maps which generate this action, given by a conditional trace, Fu = \u2212 12 Tr\u01eb (\u03a6 \u2212 \u01eb)u, with Tr\u01eb (A) = 21 Tr(A + \u01ebA\u01eb). Just for completeness we\nrecord that\n{Fu , Fv } = F\u2212i[u,v] \u2212 2ImTr(R1 R2\u2020 ),\n(40)\n\nif we decompose u, v as above. The last term represents a central part and cannot be removed\nin this classical theory.\nHow does this tie up with our system? Recall that we had a symplectic form which was\ni times a quadratic form Q, and a Hamiltonian for the free theory which is the mass part, i\ntimes an antisymmetric form \u03c9, the combination of the two provides a natural operator: \u03c9\u0303 =\nQ\u22121 \u03c9 is a type (1, 1) tensor hence a proper linear transformation. Its polar decomposition\nwill have all the basic pieces we need. Of course we have also \u03c9 \u22121 Q, so which one we choose is\ndetermined by the equations of motion. If we look at this general system in the Hamiltonian\nformalism,\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n1\nS0 = dt i\u03c8Q\u2202t \u03c8 \u2212 dtH = dt i\u03c8Q\u2202t \u03c8 \u2212 dt i\u03c8\u03c9\u03c8,\n(41)\n2\n2\n2\nthe equations of motion will give us,\n\u2202t \u03c8 = Q\u22121 \u03c9\u03c8.\n\n(42)\n\nHence the operator Q\u22121 \u03c9 is the one we should use. We find the polar decomposition of this\noperator, \u03c9\u0303 = KJ, where K is positive symmetric and J T J = 1, orthogonal(we should be\nusing the natural inner product defined by Q to define the transpose, and in the infinite\ndimensional case to define underlying real Hilbert space of initial data). However \u03c9\u0303 is antisymmetric with respect to our quadratic form, this means that J 2 = \u22121 and orthogonal, thus\na complex structure ( the complex structure coming from the other\u221achoice differs from this by\na minus sign). In our example we see that the quadratic form is 2 2\u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 )\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (thus all\nthe\ncan be done with the usual matrix transpose), and the antisymmetric form is\n\u221acalculations\n2\n2 \u22121/2\n2 1/2 \u22121\n2 \u22121\n\u2212 2m \u2202\u2212 , so we get from the polar decomposition, K = m2 [\u2212\u2202\u2212\n]\n, J = \u2212[\u2212\u2202\u2212\n] \u2202\u2212\n(we omit the identity in the color space). When we use a basis which diagonalizes \u03c9\u0303 we\nget solutions which oscillate in time with a frequency given by the eigenvalues of K. In our\nexample, if we decompose the field \u03c8 \u03b1 using a Fourier mode decomposition,\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c8 (x ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n[dp] \u03b1\n\u2212\nw (p)e\u2212ipx ,\n3/4\n2\n\n(43)\n\nwe have\nm2\n\n+\n\nw \u03b1 (p, x+ ) = w \u03b1(p, 0)e\u2212i 2|p| x for p > 0\n\nm2\n\n+\n\nw \u03b1 (p, x+ ) = w \u03b1 (p, 0)e+i 2|p| x for p < 0.\n11\n\n(44)\n\n\f(Note that the above combinations on the exponents are relativistically invariant if we recall\nm2\n). This suggests that the i subspace of J goes to creation\nthe mass-shell condition p+ = 2p\n\u2212\noperators, and \u2212i subspace goes to the annihilation operators, it is better therefore to\nrepresent our Fourier coefficients as w \u03b1 (p) = \u03be \u03b1 (p) and w \u03b1 (\u2212p) = \u03be \u0304\u03b1 (p) for p > 0. If we act\nwith J on our field variables,\n(J\u03c8)\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\n[dp]\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(\u2212i\u03be \u0304\u03b1 (p)e\u2212ipx + i\u03be \u03b1 (p)eipx ).\n3/4\n2\n\n(45)\n\nWe see now that this Fourier transform diagonalizes\nour complex structure.\nIf we look at the\n\u221a\nR\n\u2212\n\u2212\ninverse of the quadratic form it transforms as dx\u2212 dy \u2212 23/4 eipx (2 2)\u22121 \u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 )23/4 eiqy ,\nwhich gives us \u03b4[p + q]. This is the form of Q that we wanted to obtain.\nFrom the Fourier decomposition, creation and annihilation operators therefore are as \u0304 7\u2192 \u03c7\u03b1 (p). The ultimate reason for the\nsigned according to sgn(p), \u03be(p) 7\u2192 \u03c7\u2020\u03b1 (p) and \u03be(p)\nchoice of Fock vacuum is to make the Hamiltonian bounded from below, if we write our\nHamiltonian in the Fourier space,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nZ\nZ \u221e\n[dp] 2m2\n[dp] 2m2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nH0 = P\nsgn(p) : \u03c7 (\u2212p)\u03c7 (p) :=\n[: \u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (p) : \u2212 : \u03c7\u03b1 (\u2212p)\u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (\u2212p) :].\n3/2\n3/2\n+\n2\n2|p|\n2\n2|p|\n0\nNotice that sgn(p) appears in the Hamiltonian, which is basically the complex structure\nwe have, and the normal ordering (according to our choice of creation and annihilation\noperators) now makes the Hamiltonian bounded from below:\nH0 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0+\n\nm2 \u03b1\u2020\n\u03c7 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (p).\n2|p|\n\n(46)\n\nWe could question the effect of the interactions since we have been describing everything in\nterms of the free part of the Hamiltonian. Here we see a clear advantage of our light-cone\npoint of view, the complex sturcture we start with using the free Hamiltonian is independent of any of the parameters of the theory, thus the choice of quasi-free representation of\nthe canonical anticommutation relations is not affected by the change of parameters due to\ninteractions. In our case we explicitly keep the change of mass due to the interactions with\nthe gauge fields, so we are not taking advantage of this property. In more general case this\nproperty may be helpful, in fact for the scalar theory it is essential. We thus conclude our\ndiscussion on the choice of Fock space and its relation to the natural complex structure in\nour system.\nNext we show that \u03a6 \u2212 \u01eb really represents our basic bilinears: let us decompose the\ncomplexification of our one-particle Hilbert space as H+ \u2295 H\u2212 according to \u2212sgn(p), we\ncan write a general bilinear as an operator acting on the one-particle space and decomposed\naccording to this direct sum, one checks that\nF =\n\n\u0012\n\nS\n\u2212R\u0304\n\nR\n\u2212S\u0304\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(47)\n\nwith exactly S \u2020 = S and RT = \u2212R. We also know that (F + \u01eb)2 = 1. But these are\nexactly the properties satisfied by \u03a6. Our physical system has a one-particle Hilbert space\n12\n\n\fgiven by the initial data on the light-cone x+ = 0, we complexify this space and use Fourier\ntransform to put our operators into the desired form. Then H\u2212 corresponds to the negative\nfrequency components in the physics language. The Poisson bracket relations can be meaningfully extended to the Hilbert-Schmidt type R, so we need the convergence conditions.\nThe convergence conditions are also a natural consequence of the super-renormalizability of\nthis system. The time evolution of the finite Nc system should keep us in the same free Fock\nspace, and in the large-Nc limit this should be expressible as an operator like \u03a6. In fact\nthe smeared out Poisson brackets are given by the Poisson bracket relations of the moment\nmaps. Thus the symplectic structure we have on this homogeneous manifold is the one we\nhave found for our bilinears.\nIt is useful to look at the same issue from the point of view of generalized coherent\nstates: assume that we have a Lie group which is representable on a Hilbert space by\nunitary operators through a highest weight vector. If we look at the orbit of this vector\nunder the action of the group, this orbit has a natural symplectic structure, and all the\nvectors on the orbit correspond to the generalized coherent states [28, 29, 5]. In our case the\ngroup of Bogoluibov automorphisms, which do not act on the color part of our fermions are\nrepresented on the fermion Fock space by the color invariant bilinears. The highest weight\nvector is the vacuum and its orbit under this group therefore carries a natural symplectic\nstructure. The corresponding group is the restricted orthogonal group O1 (H) and the orbit\nis our phase space.(In fact physically we should be using the projective Fock space, since\nthe phase does not change the physical content of a state. The bilinears provide a unitary\nrepresentation of the central extension \u00d41 (H) of the group O1 (H), when we use the projective\nFock space, the central part disappears and we decend to the restricted orthogonal group).\nThe convergence conditions are now a result of the implementability of these automorphism\nin the Fock space, which is defined by our choice of the vacuum [23, 22, 13]. The largeNc limit allows us to restrict to the bilinears and the super-normalizability keeps us in the\nrestricted class of implementable automorphisms. Thus taking the large-Nc limit provides a\nclassical limit in this sense.\nThis shows that our large-Nc limit has a well-defined classical phase space with a natural\nsymplectic structure. This openes up various possibilities, such as studying large fluctuations\nof the field in this limit. There are various delicate questions, such as the domain of the\nHamiltonian, existence of finite time evolution, completeness of the trajectories which we\nplan to come back in the future.\n\n5\n\nBosons and Fermions\n\nThis is the begining of the second part of our paper. The second part has two themes again:\nthe construction of the phase space via the large-Nc limits of the bilinears and the geometry\nof the ensuing phase space. Since the bosonic theory is developed in [2] and the fermionic\nversion is explained in detail in the previous sections the construction of the phase space\nand finding the Hamiltonian will be very brief. We recommend the reader to look at [2] and\nwe use the results of the previous sections freely. The geometry part, which is in the next\nsection, will require new methods and in some sense it is not as complete. It may be helpful\n\n13\n\n\fif the reader also consults to [15] where the SU(Nc ) version is discussed. We will develop\nthese aspects as much as we can and in some cases we indicate what the idea should be.\nWe start our first theme: we use the same conventions as in the previous sections and our\nprevious paper. The action functional of the combined system of bosons and fermions can\nbe written as,\nZ h\n1\n\ni\n1\n1\nTrF\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + i\u03a8\u0304M \u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u03a8M \u2212 mF \u03a8\u0304M \u03a8M + (D \u03bc \u03c6)T (D\u03bc \u03c6) \u2212 m2B \u03c6T \u03c6 , (48)\n2\n2\n2\nwhere we use the same conventions as in section IV for the Majorana fermions. The transpose\nrefers to the color indices for the scalar field. Again the covariant derivative is D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc +gA\u03bc ,\nwhere A\u03bc has values in the Lie algebra of SO(Nc ). We choose x+ as time and set A\u2212 = 0 as\nour gauge fixing condition. Then the action in the light-cone formalism reads,\nZ\nh\u221a\n\u221a\nS =\ndx+ dx\u2212 i 2\u03c81T \u2202\u2212 \u03c81 + i 2\u03c82T \u2202+ \u03c82 + 2imF \u03c81T \u03c82\ni\n\u221a\n1\nm2\n1\n1\n+ \u03c6T (\u22122\u2202\u2212 )\u2202+ \u03c6 \u2212 B \u03c6T \u03c6 + gAa+ [i 2\u03c82T T a \u03c82 + (\u2202\u2212 \u03c6T T a \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6T T a \u2202\u2212 \u03c6)] + (\u2202\u2212 Aa+ )2 .\n2\n2\n2\n2\nThe advantage of the light-cone formalism is again clear, we are already in the Hamiltonian\npicture. We can read off the Poisson brackets satisfied by the dynamical fields. We also\nsee that \u03c81 is not dynamical, as well as Aa+ , therefore they can be eliminated through their\nequations of motion. The dynamical fermion field \u03c82\u03b1 will be called \u03c8 \u03b1 for simplicity as in\nthe previous sections. We will assume that the field Aa+ is eliminated after the dynamical\nfields are quantized, this will give us the quantized Hamiltonian of the system,\n\nS=\n\nH=\n\nZ\n\ndx\u2212\n\n\u00101\n\n2\n\nm2B : \u03c6T \u03c6 : +\n\n\u0011\n1\u221a 2\ng2\n1\n1\n2mF : \u03c8 T\n\u03c8 : \u2212 : Ja : 2 : Ja : ,\n2\ni\u2202\u2212\n2\n\u2202\u2212\n\n(49)\n\nwhere\n\ni\nh \u221a\n1\n(50)\nJ a = i 2\u03c8 T T a \u03c8 + (\u2202\u2212 \u03c6T T a \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6T T a \u2202\u2212 \u03c6) .\n2\nThe quantization process is defined for the Fermionic sector in section II and for bosons in\nthe reference [2]. We expand fermions and bosons into Fourier modes in a complex space,\n\n\u03c8 \u03b1 (x\u2212 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n[dp] \u03b1\n\u2212ipx\u2212\n\u03c7\n(p)e\n23/4\n\n\u03c6\u03b1 (x\u2212 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n[dp]\n\nq\n\n2|p|\n\n\u2212\n\na\u03b1 (p)e\u2212ipx ,\n\n(51)\n\nwith now \u03c7\u03b1(p)\u2020 = \u03c7\u03b1 (\u2212p) and a\u03b1\u2020 (p) = a\u03b1 (\u2212p). (We should again assume that there is an\ninfinitesimal cut-off around the zero momentum to be taken to zero at a later stage). The\nPoisson bracket relations go to\n[\u03c7\u03b1 (p), \u03c7\u03b2 (q)]+ = \u03b4[p + q]\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n[a\u03b1 (p), a\u03b2 (q)] = sgn(p)\u03b4[p + q]\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(52)\n\nThese are exactly the same as before, there is one more commutator now,\n[\u03c7\u03b1 (p), a\u03b2 (q)] = 0.\n\n(53)\n\nAs we will see in the next section the definition of the Fock vacuum brings new features-a\nlarger symmetry algebra appears. We introduce the vacuum state |0 >s , characterized by\n14\n\n\f\u03c7\u03b1 (p)|0 >s = 0, a\u03b1 (p)|0 >s = 0 for p > 0, where we put a subscript s to emphasize that the\nvacuum is for the full algebra of the boson/fermion system. We repeat for the convenience\nof the reader the normal ordering rules of the bilinears (rewritten to fit to our needs),\n1\n: \u03c7\u03b1 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (q) : = \u03c7\u03b1 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (q) \u2212 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 (1 + sgn(p))\u03b4[p + q]\n2\n1 \u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n: a (p)a (q) : = a (p)a (q) \u2212 \u03b4 (1 + sgn(p))\u03b4[p + q].\n2\nThere is an obvious extension of the general definition of normal ordering to the product of\nmore than two operators, which one needs for the reduction of the Hamiltonian: set all the\nannihilation operators to the right of creation operators in a recursive way.\nWe first introduce our bilinears for the large-Nc limit and work out their Poisson brackets.\nThen we express our Hamiltonian in the large-Nc limit in terms of these bilinears. We can\nsee that the basic color invariant observables are:\n2\n2\n: \u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (q) : B\u0302(p, q) =\n: a\u03b1\u2020 (p)a\u03b1 (q) :\nNc\nNc\n2 \u03b1\u2020\n\u02c6 (p, q) = 2 a\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (q)\n\u03c7 (p)a\u03b1 (q)\nC\u0304\n\u0108(p, q) =\nNc\nNc\nF\u0302 (p, q) =\n\nnote that we have no need for normal ordering in the last two operators since they consist\n\u02c6 are related, C\u0304 = C \u2020 , and there are\nof commuting operators. In the large-Nc limit \u0108 and C\u0304\nsimilar conditions on F, B (when we represent the resulting classical observables as integral\nkernels and think of them as now abstract operators). For our calculational purposes it is\nbetter to introduce the following variables as in section III and the reference [2],\nT\u0302 (p, q) =\n\n2\n2\n: a\u03b1 (p)a\u03b1 (q) := B\u0302(\u2212p, q) R\u0302(p, q) =\n: \u03c7\u03b1 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (q) := F\u0302 (\u2212p, q),\nNc\nNc\n\n(54)\n\nand also the variable,\n\n2 \u03b1\n\u03c7 (p)a\u03b1 (q) = \u0108(\u2212p, q).\nNc\nThese variables in the large-Nc limit satisfy the following (super)Poisson brackets,\n\u015c(p, q) =\n\n(55)\n\n\u0010\n\n{T (p, q), T (s, t)} = \u22122i sgn(p)\u03b4[p + s]T (q, t) + sgn(q)\u03b4[q + s]T (p, t) + sgn(p)\u03b4[p + t]T (s, q)\n\n+ sgn(q)\u03b4[q + t]T (s, p) + (sgn(p) + sgn(q))(\u03b4[p + s]\u03b4[q + t] + \u03b4[p + t]\u03b4[s + q])\n\u0010\n\n{R(p, q), R(s, t)} = \u22122i R(p, t)\u03b4[q + s] \u2212 R(q, t)\u03b4[p + s] + R(s, p)\u03b4[q + t] \u2212 R(s, q)\u03b4[p + t]\n+ (\u03b4[q + t]\u03b4[p + s] \u2212 \u03b4[p + t]\u03b4[q + s])(sgn(t) + sgn(s))\n\u0010\n\n{T (p, q), S(s, t)} = \u22122i S(s, q)sgn(p)\u03b4[p + t] + S(s, p)sgn(q)\u03b4[q + t]\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n{R(p, q), S(s, t)} = \u22122i S(p, t)\u03b4[q + s] \u2212 S(q, t)\u03b4[p + s]\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n{S(p, q), S(s, t)}+ = \u22122i T (q, t)\u03b4[p + s] \u2212 R(s, p)sgn(q)\u03b4[q + t] + \u03b4[p + s]\u03b4[q + t](1 + sgn(p)sgn(q)) .\nWe note that the last one is symmetric in the variables and the third and forth ones show\nthat S behaves as a module of the algebras defined by the Poisson brackets of T, R, thus it\n15\n\n\fcarries a representation of these two algebras. This is the general form of a super-algebra\nstructure. We will denote the full set of these brackects as a super-Possion bracket { , }s .\nThe conversion of the normal ordered products of non-color invariant combinations appearing in the above Hamiltonian to the full normal ordering in the large-Nc limit can be\nachieved as before resulting with the same changes in the masses m2F 7\u2192 m2F \u2212 g 2/2\u03c0 and\nm2B 7\u2192 m2R \u2212 g 2 /2\u03c0, where m2R = m2B \u2212 g 2/4\u03c0 ln(\u039bU /\u039bI ) denotes the renormalized mass of\nthe boson. We skip the details of this reduction, since they are the extensions of the details\nin [12] and we have given some essential steps in section III. The resulting Hamiltonian of\nour system in the large-Nc can be expressed as a free part and an interacting part:\n1\ng2\nH0 = (m2R \u2212\n)P\n8\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n1\ng2\n[dp]\nT (\u2212p, p) + (m2F \u2212\n)P\n|p|\n8\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n[dp]\nR(\u2212p, p).\np\n\n(56)\n\nThe interaction part is written as\nHI = F P\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\n[dpdqdsdt] G1 (p, q; s, t)T (p, q)T (s, t) + G2 (p, q; s, t)R(p, q)R(s, t)\n\u0011\n\n+G3 (p, q; s, t)S(p, q)S(s, t) ,\nwhere the kernels are given by\n\ng 2 \u03b4[p + q + s + t] sq \u2212 st + pt \u2212 pq\nq\nG1 (p, q; s, t) =\n64\n(p + s)2\n|pqst|\ng 2 \u03b4[p + q + s + t]\n64\n(p + s)2\n2\ng \u03b4[p + q + s + t]\nq\nG3 (p, q; s, t) =\n.\n64 |tq|(p + s)2\n\nG2 (p, q; s, t) = \u2212\n\nWe have not completed the definition of our large-Nc limit yet, there is a constraint. Recall\nthat we still have a left over global color invariance, which is generated by the operator,\nQ\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nZ\n\n[dp](: \u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b2 (p) : +sgn(p) : a\u03b1\u2020 (p)a\u03b2 (p) :).\n\n(57)\n\nWhen we restrict our color invariant bilinears to the color invariant sector of the full Fock\nspace, we find that\n(F + \u01eb)2 + C\u01ebC \u2020 = 1\nC\u01ebB + C\u01eb + F C + \u01ebC = 0\n\u01ebB\u01ebC \u2020 + C \u2020 + \u01ebC \u2020 \u01eb + \u01ebC \u2020 F = 0\n(\u01ebB + \u01eb)2 + \u01ebC \u2020 C = 1,\nwhere we define as in section III, \u01eb(p, q) = \u2212sgn(p)\u03b4[p \u2212 q] (here the minus sign is crucial,\nin our previous works that was not important, but in the super case there is a prefered\nchoice) and we also employ the product convention as before for example (F C)(p, s) =\nR\n[dq]F (p, q)C(q, s). We warn the reader that above the two epsilons have the same matrix\n16\n\n\felements but they are acting on different spaces. The meaning of this constraint could best\nbe understood if we introduce a super operator,\n\u03a6=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u01ebB + \u01eb \u01ebC \u2020\n.\nC\nF +\u01eb\n\n(58)\n\nThe above constraint is simply given by\n\u03a62 = 1.\n\n(59)\n\nIt also satisfies a Lie algebra condition, it is better to write it in the following form: use a\ndecomposition of our super-space into H+ |H+ \u2295\nH |H \u0013, according to the sign of \u01eb in even\n\u0012 \u2212 \u2212\n1 0\n, and we introduce with respect to\nand odd parts respectively. Then we have \u01eb\u0302 =\n0 \u22121\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 \u2212\u01ed\n, then:\nthis decomposition \u03c9\u0302s =\n1 0\n\u03c9\u0302s \u03a6\u03c4 + \u03a6\u03c9\u0302s = 0,\n\n(60)\n\nwe invite the reader to verify this.\nThere are also convergence conditions, which come from the super-renormalizability of\nthis system again. The time evolution should leave this system in the same Fock space.\nAnother way to see this is to think about the smeared out operators, and see that the\ncentral terms make sense only for the restricted set of operators, for which the off-diagonal\nblocks are in the Hilbert-Schmidt class. We can write down these convergence conditions in\nan economical way as\n[\u01eb\u0302, \u03a6] \u2208 I2 ,\n(61)\n\nwhere I2 refers to the ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt operators in this super-space. We have\nproposed elsewhere [30] a method of introducing such operators in the super-context, and\nwe assume this definition is used. Since these technical matters are not completely settled\nwe are brief at this point, see also the next section on the geometry. This completes the\nconstruction of our large-Nc limit: we postulate the above Hamiltonian, the super-Possion\nbrackets with the constraint and this defines a classical system. The \"time\" evolution is\ngiven by the basic rule: for any observable Os of the theory\n\n\u2202Os\n= {Os , H}s ,\n(62)\n\u2202x+\nwhere the Hamiltonian is in general an even function of our bilinears\u2013 which we should\nconsider as the coordinates of this phase space.\nIt is possible to carry out the analysis given in [15], but we will be content with describing\nonly the linear approximation. We plan to report on these in a separate publication (they\nwill appear in the PhD thesis of the first author).\nWe start with the linearization of the constraint \u03a62 = 1, which gives us\nF \u01eb + \u01ebF = 0 \u01ebB\u01eb + B = 0 \u01ebC + C\u01eb = 0.\n\n(63)\n\nThe first two are exactly the conditions we have found before, for mesons made up of only\nbosons in [2], the first one is in section III, and the last one is the new condition on our\n17\n\n\fodd variable. In terms of S that means we have S(u, v) = 0 unless u, v > 0 or u, v < 0.\nIf we assume u, v > 0 and evaluate the equations of motion in the linear approximation for\nS(u, v), \u2202+ S(u, v; x+ ) = {S(u, v; x+ ), H} and furthermore we make the same type of ansatz\n+\nas in [12, 2, 15] S(u, v; x+ ) = \u03b6S (x)e\u2212iP+ x , with P = u + v, x = Pu ,\n\u03bc2s \u03b6S (x) = [\n\nm2F \u2212 g 2 /2\u03c0 m2R \u2212 g 2 /2\u03c0\ng 2 Z 1 dy x + y\n+\n]\u03b6S (x) \u2212\n\u03b6S (1 \u2212 y).\n\u221a\nx\n1\u2212x\n8\u03c0 0\nxy (x \u2212 y)2\n\n(64)\n\nThe other linearized equations are the same as before (see section III and [2]).\nThere are baryonic states that we can measure by the operator\n1 Z\u221e\n[dp](\u03c7\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c7\u03b1 (p) + a\u03b1\u2020 (p)a\u03b1 (p)),\nB\u0302 =\nNc 0\nin the large-Nc limit this operator should go to B = 21\nstates for finite Nc correspond to states of the form\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\n(65)\n\n[dp](F (p, p)+B(p, p)). The baryonic\n\n1\n\u01eb\u03b1 \u03b1 ...\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b11 \u2020 (p1 )...\u03c7\u03b1s \u2020 (ps )a\u03b1s+1 \u2020 (ps+1 )...a\u03b1Nc \u2020 (pNc ),\nZ 1 2 Nc\n\n(66)\n\nwhere p1 ...pNc > 0 and products of them acting on |0 >s .\nNot surprisingly the above baryon number is not a conserved quantity, so it does not\nhave the physical importance as it has in the case of Dirac fermions where it is a conserved\nnumber, in fact a topological number(see [12] for the discussion of this in the large-Nc limit\nand its extension in [15]).\n\n6\n\nThe Geometry of the Phase Space\n\nLet us define a super space H|H, where we use a splitting to even and odd according to the\ngrading +, \u2212 (we are using a Z2 graded real Hilbert space). We recall some of the conventions,\nfollowing Berezin [19]: we work with the Grassmann envelop of this graded vector space (thus\nwe acquire a Z grading). Its mathematical theory is delicate and we will comment on it later\n(some good examples of homogeneous super-symplectic manifolds are worked out in [31],\nthis is a good reference to learn by examples). We decompose every linear transformation\nor tensor according to this grading, the standard matrix form of a linear transformation is\n\u0012\n\nA\nC\n\nB\nD\n\n\u0013\n\n: H|H \u2192 H|H,\n\n(67)\n\nwhere A, D are even and B, C are odd. This means that A = AB + AS , D = DB + DS where\nsubscript B refers to the body that is the ordinary numbers, subsrcipt S refers to the soul,\nthat is only the Grassmann part. B, C have no body they are purely Grassmann valued.\nWe have the usual hermitian conjugation of such block matrices, but the transpose has\nto be carefully defined. We introduce a super-transpose, \u03c4 ,\n\u0012\n\nA\nC\n\nB\nD\n\n\u0013\u03c4\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n18\n\nAT\n\u2212B T\n\nCT\nDT\n\n\u0013\n\n(68)\n\n\fwhere T denotes the ordinary matrix transpose. One can verify that this form satisfies\n(AB)\u03c4 = B \u03c4 A\u03c4 . It will be useful to record the following properties, Str(A\u03c4 ) = StrA, if we\ndecompose our graded space into a direct sum, for example in our case\u0012into H\u0013\n+ |H+ \u2295H\u2212 |H\u2212 ,\na b\n, then\nthe operators can also be decomposed into super-operators, say into\nc d\n\u0012\n\na b\nc d\n\n\u0013\u03c4\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\na\u03c4\nb\u03c4\n\nc\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(69)\n\nRealness is related to an involution in the Grassmann algebra, \u03be 7\u2192 \u03be \u2217 and we assume that\nthis involution obeys (\u03be i \u03be j )\u2217 = (\u03be j )\u2217 (\u03be i )\u2217 and (a\u03be)\u2217 = \u0101\u03be \u2217 , where a is a complex number\nand bar denotes the ordinary complex conjugation. The real Grassmann algebra is the part\nwhich is invariant under this involution. This means that there will be factors of i to make\nthings invariant. This implies that the real graded Hilbert space is defined residing inside a\ncomplex graded Hilbert space.\nOn the space of linear transformations there is a complex conjugation operator, according\nto Berezin conventions it should be given by the following: write a linear transformation in\nits standard form, then\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2217\n\u0013\n\u0012\na \u2212b\u2217\na b \u2217\n=\n.\n(70)\nc d\nc\u2217 d \u2217\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u2020\n1 0\na\n\u2212c\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2217\u2217\n\u03c4 \u2217\n, whereas\n= \u1ebcA \u1ebc, here \u1ebc =\nwe note that A = A, and (A ) =\n0 \u22121\n\u2212b\u2020 d\u2020\n(A\u2217 )\u03c4 = A\u2020 .\nWe have the set of real linear transformations, this set is invariant under the above conjugation, M \u2217 = M, it remains so under the product of super-matrices, thanks to (A1 A2 )\u2217 =\nA1 A2 . The set of real linear operators thus is an algebra.\nLet us assume that the even part has a symplectic form \u03c9 and the odd part has a standard\nquadratic form 1. On the complexification of this space we introduce a super-symplectic form,\n\u03c9s =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n0\n,\ni1\n\n\u03c9=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n0 \u22121\n.\n1 0\n\n(71)\n\nNote that multiplying the last part with an i does not really change anything as far as only\nthe even transformations are concerned but for the full case we need this factor. We look at\nthe space of real transformations which will leave this form invariant,\ng \u03c4 \u03c9s g = g\u03c9s g \u03c4 = \u03c9s ,\n\n(72)\n\nthis is a super-group, and it is denoted by OSp(H|H). Its even part has body isomorphic to\nSp(H) \u2295 O(H), the odd parts are modules over the Grassmann\nenvelops\nof\u0013these groups. If\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2217\n\u0012\na \u2212b\u2217\na b\n, where a, d are\n=\nwe write down the group conditions for an element\nc\u2217 d \u2217\nc d\nreal even, c real odd and b imaginary odd operators,\naT \u03c9a + icT c = \u03c9\n\naT \u03c9b + icT d = 0\n\n\u2212 bT \u03c9a + idT c = 0\n\n\u2212 bT \u03c9b + idT d = i1.\n\n(73)\n\nSince we have the complex conjugation convention (\u03c8\u03be)\u2217 = \u2212\u03c8 \u2217 \u03be \u2217 , the complex conjugate\nof a product of odd operators become imaginary, this is why we have icT c, then it becomes\na real even element of the Grassmann envelop.\n19\n\n\fDecompose our spaces according to the matrix representation of \u03c9s , W \u2295 W\u0303 |W \u2295 W\u0303 . Let\nus assume that we also have a super-complex structure, which is a type (1, 1) tensor,\n\u0012\n\nJs =\n\nJ\n0\n\n0\nJ\n\n\u0013\n\nJ=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n0 1\n.\n\u22121 0\n\n(74)\n\nAssume that we extend everything to the complexification of our original Hilbert space. The\nwe can perform a transformation S that will put the above complex structure into diagonal\nform in this complexified space. To accomplish this it is better to represent it in a slightly\ndifferent way, use a decomposition W |W \u2295 W\u0303 |W\u0303 , then\nJs =\n\n\u0012\n\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n\n\u0013\n\n1\nS=\u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\ni \u2212i\n1 1\n\n\u0013\n\n(75)\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212i 0\n, which defines \u01eb\u0302 in this\nNow compute S\n0 i\ndecomposition. We use a decomposition according to the sign of i and the resulting graded\nHilbert space becomes H+ |H+ \u2295 H\u2212 |H\u2212 . If we compute the transformation of \u03c9s , it goes\ninto S \u03c4 \u03c9s S since it is a two form, and we get\n\u22121\n\nJs S and see that we get J\u02c6s = i\u01eb\u0302 =\n\n\u03c9\u0302s =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n0 \u2212\u01ed\n,\n1 0\n\n\u01ed =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1 0\n,\n0 \u22121\n\n(76)\n\nwith respect to the above decomposition. Obviously our real group also transformed by the\nsame rule as Js , so a typical group element becomes according to the above decomposition,\ng=\n\n\u0012\n\nA\nB\u2217\n\n\u0013\n\nB\n.\nA\u2217\n\n(77)\n\nNote that each of the blocks are super-operators with standard\u0012decompositions,\nand for\neach\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2217\n\u0013\na \u2212b\u2217\na b \u2217\n.

We should remember that\n(M \u03c4 )\u03c4 = \u01edM \u01ed, then we can see that\nthey are\nconsistent. There is an interesting subgroup,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA 0\nand A satisfies\ngiven by elements of the form g =\n0 A\u2217\nA\u03c4 \u01edA\u2217 = \u01ed A\u2217\u03c4 A = 1,\n20\n\n(80)\n\n\frecall that A\u2217\u03c4 = A\u2020 and (A\u03c4 )\u2217 = \u01edA\u2020 \u01ed, this is the same as before except that we express it\nin the subspace, so we should use\nof \u1ebc, we get A\u2020 A = AA\u2020 = 1.

This\ngroup is denoted by U(H+ |H+ ) and it is the super-unitary group of H+ .\nLet us define the orbit of \u01eb\u0302, this is really the complex structure if we remove the factors\nof i, under the real group OSp:\n\u03a6 = g \u22121 \u01eb\u0302g.\n(82)\nIt is immediate that \u03a62 = 1. We will now show that we also have\n\u03c9\u0302s \u03a6\u03c4 + \u03a6\u03c9\u0302s = 0,\nso it is an element of the Lie algebra of OSp. Define \u00ca =\nwritten in this splitting of the Hilbert space, and note (\u03c9\u0302s\u03c4 )\u22121\n\u01eb\u0302\u03c9\u0302s = \u2212\u03c9\u0302s \u01eb\u0302, then,\n\n(83)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u01ed 0\n, this is really our \u1ebc\n0 \u01ed\n= \u03c9\u0302s , \u03c9\u0302s\u03c4 = \u03c9\u0302s \u00ca, \u03c9\u0302s2 = \u00ca and\n\n\u03a6\u03c4 \u03c9s = (\u03c9\u0302s\u22121g \u03c4 \u03c9\u0302s \u01eb\u0302g)\u03c4 \u03c9s = g \u03c4 \u01eb\u0302\u03c9\u0302s \u00cag \u03c4 \u03c4 \u00ca = g \u03c4 \u01eb\u0302\u03c9\u0302s g\n= \u2212g \u03c4 \u03c9\u0302s \u01eb\u0302g = \u2212\u03c9\u0302s \u03c9\u0302s\u22121 g \u03c4 \u03c9\u0302s \u01eb\u0302g = \u2212\u03c9\u0302s g \u22121 \u01eb\u0302g = \u2212\u03c9\u0302s \u03a6,\nwhere we used \u00cag \u03c4 \u03c4 \u00ca \u0012= g. Let\n\u0013 us look at the stability subgroup of \u01eb\u0302, that is given by\nA 0\n, and we have seen that this can be identified with the\noperators of the form\n0 A\u2217\nunitary operators on H+ |H+ , U(H+ |H+ ). Hence we conclude that our variable \u03a6 is actually\nparametrizing the space\nOSp(H|H)/U(H+ |H+ ).\n(84)\n\nWhat is the advantage of this parametrization? The above super manifold is actually a\nsymplectic manifold with a super-symplectic structure most naturally written in terms of\nthe variable \u03a6:\ni\n\u03a9s = Str\u03a6d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6.\n(85)\n4\nThis is formally defined, but we use the rules of super analysis to define our differential\nforms. Clearly it is closed, use\ndStr\u03a6d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 = Strd\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 = Str\u03a62 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6\n= Str\u03a6d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6\u03a6 = \u2212Str\u03a62 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6.,\nwhere we used StrAB = StrBA. It is also clear that this form is homogeneous. Its nondegenaracy can be proved at \u01eb\u0302, and homogeneity proves it everywhere.\nUpto now we have really used a finite dimensional approach, but to identify the largeNc phase space of the previous section, we need to extend these notions to the infinite\n21\n\n\fdimensional case. The extension is formally simple, we assume that we have super-Hilbert\nspaces, that is even and odd spaces each one are coming from a separable Hilbert space and\nwe use a proper extension of the Grassmann envelop to this case(this is not so obvious and\nwe assume our proposal in [30], this may not be the only possibility see [32, 33]). In this\ninfinite dimensional setting we introduce a Hilbert-Schmidt condition, the group that we use\nshould be the restricted real OSp group,\nOSp1(H|H) = {g =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nA\nB\u2217\n\nB\n|g \u22121 exists , g \u03c4 \u03c9\u0302s \u01ebg = 1 [\u01eb\u0302, g] \u2208 I2 }.\nA\u2217\n\n(86)\n\nThe variable \u03a6 now satisfies some convergence conditions, indeed one can check that\n\u03a6 \u2212 \u01eb\u0302 \u2208\n\n\u0012\n\nI1\nI2\n\n\u0013\n\nI2\n,\nI1\n\n(87)\n\nwhere each block refers to a super-operator in the appropriate class of operator ideal. These\nconvergence conditions imply that the super-symplectic form \u03a9s we defined in the finite\ndimensional setting makes sense. The trace class conditions are important to write down\nmoment maps, but we will ignore it for this work. Hence we have an infinite dimensional\nphase space,\ni\nOSp1(H|H)/U(H+ |H+ ), \u03a9s = Str\u03a6d\u03a6 \u2227 d\u03a6..\n(88)\n4\nThe reader can now see how this is related to our system, from the experience we have in\nthe previous cases. In our problem we have a free action which has bosons and fermions,\nZ\n\u00101\n1 \u221a\n1\u221a 2 T 1 \u0011\n1\n\u03c8 . (89)\n2mF \u03c8\nS0 = dx+ dx\u2212 \u03c6T (\u22122\u2202\u2212 )\u2202+ \u03c6 + i2 2\u03c8 T \u2202+ \u03c8 \u2212 m2B \u03c6T \u03c6 \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\ni\u2202\u2212\nThis action is written in the standard light-cone frame and one of the components of the\nMajorana field has been eliminated in favor of the other. The transpose refers to the color\nindices for the gauge group SO(Nc ). As it stands this does not require the full content of\nthe super-geometry, but as we have seen the interaction terms, given by the proper bilinears\nof field operators, makes the use of super geometry most convenient: when we reformulate\nour theory in terms of bilinears, we need the combinations which can only be expressed in\nterms of odd operators. We will now see that the Poisson algebra of these bilinears can only\nbe formulated as a super-two form. Moreover a simple iterative solution of the constraint\nequation reveals that the bosonic operators should be given as an infinite series of products of\nodd operators, this is why we think it is most natural to use the full content of the Berezin's\nsuper-analysis. (We hope to come back to the more mathematical aspects of our system in\na future publication).\nIn our theory we have a super-symplectic form and a super-quadratic form which is in\nthe standard representation given by\n\u03c9s =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22122\u2202\u2212\n0\n\n0\n\u221a\n\ni2 2\n\n\u0013\n\nIc ,\n\nQs =\n\n\u0012\n\nm2B\n0\n\n\u221a 0 \u22121\n\u2212 2m2F i\u2202\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\nIc ,\n\n(90)\n\nwhere we have the identity Ic in the color space.

These commutation/anticommutation\nrelations have the operator \u03c9\u0302s on the right hand-side, this is what determines the algebra.\nHence we see that we are in the geometric setting we were describing. Our bilinears combined in the form of \u03a6 satisfy all the Lie algebra properties. In fact it is instructive to write\ndown the super-symplectic form \u03a9s with \u03a6 expressed in terms of the bilinears B, F, C, C \u2020.\nThen the reader can see that we have the same Poisson brackets satisfied by these bilinears.\nFrom the above discussion we again see the remarkable fact that the geometry which is\ndefined by the complex structure Js is independent of the parameters of the theory in this\nlight-cone method. This means even though the masses change due to the interactions this\nwill not change the representation of canonical commutation/anticommutation relations we\nstarted with, as a result the geometry stays the same.\nOur bilinears will correspond to the generators of the automorphisms of this full algebra\nof commutation/anticommutation relations, and it is the restricted real OSp group(for finite dimensional automorphism groups see [34], for Bogoliubov automorphisms of qausi-free\nrepresentations see [35, 36, 37, 38]). We can check that the bilinears we have satisfy the\nLie algebra conditions and the implementability of these automorphisms will imply the convergence conditions. Therefore the evolution of the system in the large-Nc limit realizes all\n23\n\n\fautomorphisms of the the quasi-free second quantization of this system when we think of\nit without the color part\u2013the color part has been averaged out and reduced the system to\nthis bilinears. We may give an argument using the super-coherent states[39, 40], similar to\nd which is\nthe ordinary cases: there is a central extension of the automorphism group OSp\n1\nrealized by these bilinears on the full Fock space. When we think about the projective Fock\nspace this descends to the OSp1 group. The orbit of the vacuum under this group gives us a\nclassical phase space albeit a more general one, with a super symplectic form. The large-Nc\nlimit provides this reduction to the space of super-coherent states. This is a natural classical\nphase space and the large-Nc limit corresponds to this classical limit.\nBefore ending our discussions we would like to make a few comments of general nature.\nLet us write down a super-dynamical system in the Hamiltonian form\nS0 =\n\nZ\n\n1\ndt \u03a8\u03c4 \u03c9s \u2202t \u03a8 \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\ndt \u03a8\u03c4 Qs \u03a8.\n2\n\n(97)\n\nWe assume that the action is an element of the even part of the Grassmann algebra. If we\nwant this to be real\nwe demand\n(\u03a8\u03c4 Qs \u03a8)\u2217 = \u03a8\u03c4 \u1ebcQ\u2217s \u03a8 = \u03a8\u03c4 Qs \u03a8, that is Qs = \u1ebcQ\u2217s , we are\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\nin the standard decomposition. For the first term it implies the\nagain using \u1ebc =\n0 \u22121\nsame \u1ebc\u03c9s\u2217 = \u03c9. If we further note that it should be invariant under the transpose, we get for\nthe first term using an integration by parts for the time derivative, \u03a8\u03c4 \u03c9s \u2202t \u03a8 = \u2212\u03a8\u03c4 \u03c9s\u03c4 \u1ebc\u2202t \u03a8,\nwhich implies \u03c9s = \u2212\u03c9s\u03c4 \u1ebc and the second term requires \u03a8\u03c4 Qs \u03a8 = \u03a8\u03c4 Q\u03c4s \u1ebc\u03a8, which means\nwe should have Qs = Q\u03c4s \u1ebc. The equations of motion will give us,\n\u2202t \u03a8 = \u03c9s\u22121 Qs \u03a8.\n\n(98)\n\nThis suggests that we should further investigate operator \u03c9s\u22121 Qs which is a type (1, 1) tensor,\nthus a true linear transformation. We note that \u03c9s\u22121Qs is real: (\u03c9s\u22121 Qs )\u2217 = (\u03c9s\u22121 )\u2217 Q\u2217s =\n\u03c9s\u22121 \u1ebc \u1ebcQs = \u03c9s\u22121 Qs , by using the conjugation properties of \u03c9s and Q. This operator is\nantisymmetric with respest to the form defined by Qs :\n\u22121\n\u03c4\n\u22121 \u03c4\n\u03c4 \u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nQ\u22121\ns (\u03c9s Qs ) Qs = Qs Qs (\u03c9s ) Qs = \u2212Qs Qs \u1ebc \u1ebc\u03c9s Qs = \u2212\u03c9s Qs ,\n\n(99)\n\nas well as under \u03c9s . It would be most natural if we could use a generalization of the polar\n\u22121\nt\ndecomposition for Q\u22121\ns \u03c9s , and write this operator as \u03c9s Qs = Js Ks , where Js Js = 1, and\nt\nt\nKs > 0, Ks = Ks , with an appropriate transpose and positivity is assumed to be given a\nmeaning in this super-context. Then we could claim that the basis in which Js is diagonal,\nwill tell us the separation of creation and annihilation operators in this full generality. This\ncan be done in the simple case we looked at, when the operators involved only had body\nparts, and no Grassmann numbers. Unfortunately for the general case we do not have\nthe proper mathematical machinery. If we could find a super-transformation S, such that\nS \u22121 \u03c9s\u22121 Qs S is diagonal with each entry (\u00b1i\u03bbk ) for a pure number \u03bbk we could postulate\nthe quantization by means of canonical commutation/anticommutation relations. To the\nbest of our knowledge there is no such theorem. We think these questions deserve further\ninvestigations.\n\n24\n\n\f7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research is largely based on the ideas of S.
