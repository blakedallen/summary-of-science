Angelo, Via Cinthia, I-80126 Napoli, Italy\nWe study some implications on standard matter oscillations of solar neutrinos induced by a\nbackground of extremely low energy thermal neutrinos trapped inside the Sun by means of coherent\nrefractive interactions. Possible experimental tests are envisaged and current data on solar neutrinos\ndetected at Earth are briefly discussed.\n\narXiv:hep-ph/0311093v1 7 Nov 2003\n\nPACS numbers: 26.65.+t, 13.15.+g, 14.60.Pq\n\nExperiments detecting neutrinos of energy up to several M eV emitted by the Sun measure particle fluxes [1],\n[2] which are lower than those predicted by the Standard\nSolar Model [3], apparently depending on neutrino energy. Recent results obtained by the SNO collaboration\n[2], regarding charged current as well as neutral current\ndata, have convincingly shown (with a high statistical significance level) that such a deficit is explained in terms of\ntransitions from \u03bde into a different (active) flavor state.\nFurthermore, compelling evidence for atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc disappearance [4], independently checked by the K2K longbaseline experiment [5], also points towards a natural explanation in terms of neutrino flavor oscillations. However, while atmospheric neutrinos would mainly change\nflavor during their travel in air (practically, in vacuum),\nneutrinos emitted by the Sun could experience coherent\ninteractions with the solar matter, enhancing the transition probability according to the MSW theory [6]. As\nobserved, for example, in Ref. [7], the oscillation scenario is nicely confirmed by a global analysis of solar,\natmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments, including KamLAND recent results [9]. In particular, possible\nindications in favor of solar matter effects in neutrino\noscillation seem to emerge from a combined analysis of\nSNO and KamLAND experimental observations [8].\nSolar neutrinos detected at Earth are produced deep\ninside the Sun by the energy generating nuclear fusion reactions, and their (observationally relevant) energy spectrum typically ranges from hundreds of keV to tens of\nM eV . However, lower energy neutrinos are produced as\nwell in the solar core by means of weak charged and neutral current mediated thermal processes [10]. The mean\nenergy of such neutrinos is of the order of the core temperature (\u223c 1.3 keV ), so that they account for a negligible fraction of the energy loss (\u223c 0.001%) and, therefore,\nare potentially not relevant for the solar evolution. Nevertheless, as pointed out in Ref. [10], the contribution of\nsolar thermal neutrinos to the flux at earth is dominant\nin the energy window above the cosmic background ener\u22122\ngies ( >\n\u223c 10 eV ) and below the solar fusion and terrestrial neutrino energy thresholds (around 5 keV ). Apart\nfrom peculiar informations on the Sun properties carried by thermal neutrinos, which would be useful for a\n\nfurther checking of the Standard Solar Model, the detection of the existence of such neutrinos will also translate\ninto stringent kinematic limits on the mass of muon or\ntau neutrinos. However, despite their importance for Solar and Particle Physics, there is no obvious experiment\naimed to give a direct or indirect measurement of thermal\nneutrinos, due to their low scattering cross section.\nIn this paper we will focus on extremely low energy\nneutrinos and discuss an intriguing possibility for an indirect test of solar thermal neutrinos, assuming that the\nhigher energy ones (from nuclear fusion reactions) experience flavor oscillations in the Sun, according to the MSW\ntheory.\nNEUTRINOS TRAPPED IN THE SUN\n\nIt is commonly believed that, due to their extremely\nsmall cross section, very low energy neutrinos produced\nin a star freely escape from it. This reasoning does not\ntake into account, however, coherent interactions with\nthe particles in the plasma which, as shown by Loeb [11],\nbecome important at low energy. In practice the refractive index of neutrinos with energy E in matter, of order\nGF N/E (GF is the Fermi coupling constant and N is\nthe number density of particles in the plasma interacting\nwith neutrinos), approaches unity at very low energies,\nso that a complete inner reflection takes place. As a consequence trapped neutrinos exist inside the Sun (and, in\ngeneral, in every star). Smirnov and Vissani [12] have\npointed out the crucial role played by such neutrino sea\nin order to solve the problem of an unphysically large\nvalue for the self-energy of stars due to many-body longrange neutrino forces.\nThe weak interaction of thermal neutrinos with the\nparticle in the solar medium can be parameterized in\nterms of an effective potential [13]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n1\nV\u03bde = \u00b1 2 GF Ne \u2212 Nn\n(1)\n2\nfor \u03bde and\nGF\nV\u03bdx = \u2213 \u221a Nn\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nfor non-electron neutrinos (x = \u03bc, \u03c4 ). Here Ne and\nNn are the electron and neutron number density of the\nplasma, respectively; the upper sign refer to neutrinos,\nwhile the lower one to antineutrinos. Effectively, the star\ncan be viewed as a potential well for neutrinos with depth\ngiven in Eq. (1) or (2). Since, in the Sun, we typically\nhave Ne > Nn /2, \u03bde and \u03bd x experience a repulsive potential, while an attractive one acts on \u03bd e and \u03bdx . As a\nresult the Sun expels \u03bde , \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd \u03c4 , while non-electron\nneutrinos and electron antineutrinos are trapped inside\nit.\n\ncomposed also of thermal neutrinos with number densities Ni (i = \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc , \u03bd \u03c4 ) has been calculated in\nRef. [13] [18]\n\u001a\n\u221a\n1\nV\u03bde = 2 GF Ne \u2212 Nn + 2 (N\u03bde \u2212 N\u03bd e ) +\n2\n\u001b\n(N\u03bdx \u2212 N\u03bd x )\n(9)\n\u001a\n\u221a\n1\nV\u03bda = 2 GF \u2212 Nn + (N\u03bde \u2212 N\u03bd e ) +\n2\n\u001b\n2 (N\u03bdx \u2212 N\u03bd x ) .\n(10)\n\nMODIFIED MSW EFFECT\n\nFor massive neutrinos, flavor eigenstates created by\nweak interactions are, in general, linear superposition of\nthe propagating mass eigenstates, and the phenomenon\nof flavor oscillations can take place [14]. Assuming, for\nsimplicity, transitions between only two (active) flavor\nstates \u03bde and \u03bda (a = \u03bc, \u03c4 ), the evolution equation for\nsolar neutrinos reads as follows [15]:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nd\n\u03bde\n\u03bde\n,\n(3)\n= H\ni\n\u03bda\ndx \u03bda\nwhere the Hamiltonian matrix can be cast in the form\nH = H0 + Hint\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206m2 \u2212 cos 2\u03b8 sin 2\u03b8\n,\nsin 2\u03b8 cos 2\u03b8\n4E\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 V\n0\n=\n.\n0 \u2212V\n2\n\nH0 =\nHint\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nHere E is the neutrino energy, \u2206m2 = m22 \u2212 m21 is the\nsquared mass difference between the two mass eigenstates\nand \u03b8 is the (vacuum) mixing angle. The potential V\n(depending, in general, on the position x) is given by the\ndifference between the \u03bde and \u03bda interaction energies with\nthe solar matter:\nV = V\u03bde \u2212 V\u03bda .\n\n(7)\n\nIn the ordinary MSW theory, assuming the (neutral)\nmedium to be composed of electrons, neutrons and protons, the potential in Eq. (7) depends only on the electron number density Ne [6], [13]:\n\u221a\n(8)\nV = 2 GF Ne .\nHowever, as seen above, a sea of thermal neutrinos\nand/or antineutrinos exists in the Sun which, in principle, influences the propagation of fusion neutrinos escaping from the star and detected at Earth. The interaction energies of \u03bde and \u03bda propagating in a medium\n\nAs pointed out above, the solar plasma acts through a\nrepulsive potential on thermal \u03bde and \u03bd x , so that for simplicity we definitively assume that N\u03bde = N\u03bd x = 0 in the\nSun. The difference in Eq. (7) then takes the form:\n\u221a\nV = 2 GF \u03b1 Ne\n(11)\nwith\n\u03b1 = 1\u2212\n\nN\u03bd e + N\u03bdx\n.\nNe\n\n(12)\n\nThe effect of the thermal neutrino sea on the MSW mechanism is thus simply parameterized in terms of the quantity \u03b1 in Eq. (12): for \u03b1 = 1 we recover the ordinary\nMSW theory. Note that since the trapping of thermal\n\u03bd e and \u03bdx is ruled by coherent interactions with the electrons (and neutrons) in the plasma (see Eqs. (1) and (2)),\nit is natural to expect that, at a rough approximation,\nthe parameter \u03b1 is nearly constant through the Sun. In\nthis case the structure of the evolution equation in (3)\ndoes not change (no x-dependent term appears) and the\noscillation probability changes only for a multiplicative\nconstant factor in V .\nTHEORETICAL PREDICTIONS FOR THE\nNEUTRINO SEA\n\nVery low energy neutrinos are created in stars by a\nnumber of electroweak processes. Usually one can think\nabout URCA processes, neutrino pair bremsstrahlung or\neven production induced by many-body long-range forces\n[12]. To our best knowledge, the most complete study\npresent in the literature regarding the production od subkeV neutrinos has been performed in Ref. [10]. Here\nthe authors show that the relevant processes in the Sun\nare: 1) Compton production; 2) intermediate plasmon\npole contribution to the Compton process; 3) transverse\nplasmon decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs; 4) decay of thermally populated excited nuclear states into\nneutrino-antineutrino pairs by means of Z 0 emission; 5)\npair production in electron transitions from free to bound\natomic states. It is found that the pole contribution to\n\n\f3\nthe Compton process dominates the production of low energy (< 5 keV ) \u03bde and \u03bd e while, for non-electron neutrinos, the dominant channel below 2 keV is the free-bound\nprocess.\nLet us now assume, as above, that extremely low energy \u03bd e , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 are completely trapped inside the Sun. A\nrough estimate of the number densities of such neutrinos, relevant for the evaluation of the parameter \u03b1 in\nEq. (12), has been previously given in [12]. Assuming\nthermodynamical equilibrium and strong fermion degeneration for the neutrino sea, the number density of the\nparticles in the bath is N\u03bd \u223c \u03bc3 \u223c V 3 , where \u03bc is the\nneutrino chemical potential which would be of the same\norder of magnitude of the potential in Eq. (1) or (2).\nIn this case the resulting N\u03bd is exceedingly small, of the\norder of 10\u221228 cm\u22123 . However, in this estimate it has\nnot been taken into account that the production reactions (for example those considered in [10]) render neutrino trapping a non-equilibrium phenomenon. Then it\nseems natural to assume that the number densities of\ntrapped very low energy neutrinos is much greater than\nthe corresponding equilibrium values [19], as for example\nhappens in the early Universe plasma during primordial\nnucleosynthesis [16]. Therefore, since the Standard Solar Model in its present form explains well the observed\nproperties of the Sun [3], we have only to ask that the\nenergy density of trapped neutrinos is much lower than\nthe energy density of the solar plasma of electrons, protons and neutrons. in order to not affect solar dynamics.\nTo obtain a rough limit on N\u03bd , let us assume for simplicity that the energy density \u03c1 of the solar plasma is\ncontributed only by electrons at a temperature of order\n1 keV : \u03c1e \u223c Ne * < Ee > \u223c Ne * T \u223c 1014 eV 4 . By taking\nthe typical energy of trapped neutrinos to be of the order\nof the potential in Eq. (1) or (2) (as also assumed in [11]\nand [12]), and requiring that the energy density of the\nneutrino sea \u03c1\u03bd \u223c N\u03bd * E\u03bd is much lower than \u03c1e , we get\nthe very weak limit N\u03bd \u226a 1041 cm\u22123 . In practice, using\nthe above arguments, even if the number density ratio in\nEq. (12) approaches the face value 1, the energy density\nof trapped neutrinos would account for only 10\u22122 eV 4\n(i.e. about 14 orders of magnitude less than electrons),\nand solar evolution is completely unaffected.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL TESTS\n\nThe indirect detection of the neutrino sea in the Sun\ncan be carried out by studying solar neutrino oscillations\nand measuring the parameter \u03b1 in Eq. (11). The effect considered here depends, of course, on the number\ndensity of the particles in the sea, and any observed deviation from the standard MSW prediction (\u03b1 = 1) in the\ndirection underlying Eq. (11) (\u03b1 < 1) should be ascribed\nto the presence of a neutrino sea in the Sun.\nThe feasibility of such kind of analysis, in the near fu-\n\nture, is well outlined in a recent paper by Fogli et al. [8].\nHere the authors perform global fits of current solar neutrino data together with CHOOZ reactor observations\n[17] and recent KamLAND results [9], obtaining indications in favor of neutrino matter oscillations in the Sun.\nThis is achieved by means of a \u03c72 -analysis for the parameter \u03b1 actually appearing in our Eq. (11): a value \u03b1 = 0\nwould indicate no matter effects (vacuum oscillations),\nwhile \u03b1 = 1 is an evidence for the (standard) MSW theory. However, in the light of the mechanism proposed\nhere, observed values for \u03b1 different from 1 would give\nstrong evidence in favor of the existence of the solar neutrino sea.\nAs a result, with current data, the authors of Ref. [8]\nfind a best fit value for \u03b1 close to unity (slightly greater\nthan 1) with an overall \u00b13\u03c3 range spanning about three\n2\norders of magnitude (approximately 10\u22121 <\n\u223c \u03b1 <\n\u223c 10 ).\nWhile this allowed range is rather large, and no firm conclusion can be reached neither on general matter effects\nin solar neutrino oscillations nor on the presence of effects\ninduced by a neutrino sea, nevertheless it is interesting to\nobserve that simulated data for the KamLAND experiment with increased (a factor 10) statistics would exclude\nvalues for \u03b1 greater than 1 but not those corresponding\nto \u03b1 < 1. Since a value for \u03b1 lower than unity is a peculiar prediction of the mechanism considered here (see\nEq. (12), if such a poor indication will be confirmed by\nfuture experiments, it would give a strong evidence for\nthe sea of very low energy neutrinos in the Sun.\nThe author is grateful to Drs. A. De Candia and G.\nImbriani for valuable discussions.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: Salvatore.Esposito@na.infn.it\n[1] B. T. Cleveland et al., Astrophys. J. 496 (1998)\n505; J. N. Abdurashitov et al.

In\nfact the Pauli principle forbids the filling of one-particle\nstates with more than one neutrino, but the distribution\nwith energy of these states is not related to the Fermi distribution for non-equilibrium configurations. In principle\nwe can then think to peculiar distributions with many\nstates at very low energies and few states at higher energies, where neutrinos are no longer trapped by refraction.\n\n\f"}
