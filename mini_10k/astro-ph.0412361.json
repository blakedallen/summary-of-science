INTRODUCTION\n\nM82 is one of the nearest and brightest starburst\ngalaxies. Located at a distance of 3.9 Mpc, and with\na luminosity of 3.7\u00d71010 L\u2299 , it has been extensively\nstudied in many molecules. Compared to other prototypical nearby starburst galaxies like NGC 253 and\nIC 342, M82 presents systematically low abundances\nof the molecules NH3 , CH3 OH, CH3 CN, HNCO and\nSiO (Takano et al. 2003). Different explanations have\nbeen proposed to account for this peculiar chemistry.\nSince all these molecules are related to dust grain chemistry, Takano et al. (2003) proposed that the formation\nof molecules on dust and/or evaporation to the gas phase\nis not efficient in M82.\nOn the other hand, several studies have revealed\nthat the starburst has heavily influenced the interstellar medium in M82 by producing high cosmic rays and\nUV fluxes. A low density ionized component is filling\na substantial fraction of the volume in M82 (see e.g\nSeaquist et al. 1996). The molecular gas is embedded\nin this component in the form of warm (Tk >50 K) and\ndense (n>104 cm\u22123 ) clouds (Mao et al. 2000). Dense\nPDRs are expected to form in the borders of these clouds\n(Wolfire et al. 1990; Lord et al. 1996). Wolfire et al.\n(1990) have modeled the CII, SiII and OI emission and\nestimated a UV field of G0 =104 in units of the Habing\nfield and a density of n\u223c105 cm\u22123 for the atomic component. Schilke et al. (1993) reported observations of\nthe CI (3 P1 -3 P0 ) line deriving a [CI]/CO column den1\n\nObservatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional (OAN), Apdo. 112, E28803 Alcal\u00e1 de Henares (Madrid,Spain)\n2 LERMA, UMR 8112, CNRS, Ecole Normale Superieure et Observatoire de Paris, 24 rue Lhomond, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France\n3 SRON, PO Box 800, 9700 AV Groningen, The Netherlands, under an external fellowship\n4 Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (IAA),CSIC,Apdo. 3004,\nE-18080 Granada (Spain)\n5 Departamento de F\u0131\u0301sica, UEM, Urb.

Recent results suggest that the\nstrong UV flux dominates the chemistry of the molecular gas in M82. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. (2002) obtained a\nhigh-angular-resolution image showing widespread HCO\nemission in this galaxy. The enhanced HCO abundance\n([HCO]/[H13 CO+ ]\u223c3.6) measured across the whole M82\ndisk was interpreted in terms of a giant PDR of 650 pc\nsize.\nIn this paper, we present observations of a selected set\nof radicals (CN, C2 H), reactive ions (CO+ , HOC+ ) and\nsmall hydrocarbons (c-C3 H2 ) which are excellent probes\nof the atomic to molecular transition in PDRs. In particular, the [CN]/[HCN] ratio has been successfully used as\na PDR indicator in regions with very different physical\nconditions in our Galaxy (Fuente et al. 1993, 1995, 1996).\nThe detection of the reactive ion HOC+ is almost unambiguously associated to regions with a high ionizing flux,\neither PDRs or XDRs (Fuente et al. 2003; Rizzo et al.\n2003; Usero et al. 2004). Recent works have revealed\nthat the abundances of some hydrocarbons, such as cC3 H2 and C4 H, are an order of magnitude larger in PDRs\nthan those predicted by gas-phase models (Teyssier et al.\n2004; Pety et al. 2004).\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe observations were carried out in June and November 2004 with the IRAM 30 m radiotelescope at Pico\nde Veleta (Spain). We used 2 SIS receivers tuned in\nsingle-sideband mode in the 1 mm and 3 mm bands.\nThe observed transitions are: CN 1\u21920 (113.490 GHz),\nCN 2\u21921 (226.874 GHz), HCN 1\u21920 (88.631 GHz), C2 H\n1\u21920 (87.317 and 87.402 GHz), c-C3 H2 21,2 \u219210,1 (85.339\nGHz), c-C3 H2 61,6 \u219250,5 (217.822 GHz), CH3 C2 H 5k \u21924k\n(85.457 GHz), HC3 N 9\u21928 (81.881 GHz) and HOC+ 1\u21920\n(89.487 GHz). The line intensities have been scaled\n\n\f2\n\nFuente et al.\n\nto the main beam brightness temperature. The halfpower beam width (HPBW) of the telescope is 29\u2032\u2032 at\n85 GHz, 22\u2032\u2032 at 115 GHz and 12\u2032\u2032 at 230 GHz. We observed three positions across the M82 disk: the nucleus\n(RA(2000): 09h 55m 51.9s , Dec(2000): 69o 4\u2032 47.11\u2032\u2032 ) and\nthe two peaks in the HCO emission [offsets (+14\u2032\u2032 ,+5\u2032\u2032 )\nand (\u221214\u2032\u2032 ,\u22125\u2032\u2032 ) hereafter referred to as E. and W. knot\nrespectively]. The observed spectra are shown in Fig. 1.\nTo compare the 1.3mm and 3mm CN and c-C3 H2 lines\nand make excitation calculations, we have derived beam\nfilling factors from the H13 CO+ interferometric image of\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. (2002). This assumption is justified\nsince H13 CO+ is an optically thin tracer of dense gas (n>\n104 cm\u22123 ) and presents a quite uniform abundance in a\nwide range of physical conditions.\nThe CH3 C2 H and C2 H column densities have been\nestimated using the LTE approximation. For C2 H, we\nhave assumed the typical rotation temperature in galactic PDRs, Trot = 10 K (Fuente et al. 2003). In the case\nof CH3 C2 H, all the lines of the K-ladder are blended. In\nour estimates, we have assumed that 40% of the emission comes from the K=0 line and Trot = 20 K. These\nassumptions are based on the CH3 C2 H observations of\nSgr B2 and Orion which have similar physical conditions\nto M82 (Churchwell & Hollis 1983). An LVG code has\nbeen used to derive densities and beam averaged column\ndensities for the other species. In these calculations, we\nhave assumed Tk =60 K inferred from the NH3 lines by\nWeiss et al. (2001).\n3. RESULTS\n\nWe have estimated the hydrogen densities in the M82\ndisk by fitting with a LVG code the CN and C3 H2\nlines. Hydrogen densities between nH2 \u223c5\u00d7104 cm\u22123 and\nnH2 \u223c2\u00d7105 cm\u22123 are derived from both molecules. Assuming nH2 \u223c1\u00d7105 cm\u22123 , we have calculated the column densities averaged in a beam of 29\u2032\u2032 . The CN\nand HCN column densities are quite constant along the\ngalaxy disk with values, N(CN)=2.0\u00b10.5\u00d71014 cm\u22122\nand N(HCN)=4.0\u00b10.5\u00d71013 cm\u22122 . The [CN]/[HCN]\nratio is similar to 5 in all positions (see Table 1).\nAs discussed in Section 4, this large value of the\n[CN]/[HCN] ratio is only reached in the most heavily\nUV exposed layers of a PDR. The derived c-C3 H2 and\nCH3 C2 H column densities are also quite uniform along\nthe disk with values, N(C3 H2 )\u223c1.7\u00b10.4\u00d71013 cm\u22122\nand N(CH3 C2 H)\u223c1.0\u00b10.6\u00d71014 cm\u22122 . These column\ndensities are in agreement with previous estimates by\nOike et al. (2004) and Mauersberger et al. (1991). Finally, we have not detected the HC3 N 9\u21928 line towards\nany position with an upper limit to the column density\nN(HC3 N)<2\u00d71012 cm\u22122 towards the E. knot. As discussed in Section 4 the non-detection of HC3 N and the\nderived lower limit to the [c-C3 H2 ]/[HC3 N] ratio argue\nin favor of a PDR chemistry in M82.\nWe have detected the reactive ion HOC+ in the three\nselected positions across the M82 disk. Furthermore,\nthe intensities of the HOC+ 1\u21920 lines are similar, even\nlarger, than those of the H13 CO+ 1\u21920 lines. Assuming\nthe same physical conditions for H13 CO+ and HOC+ , we\nderive a [HCO+ ]/[HOC+ ] ratio of \u223c40 across the 650 pc\ninner disk, which is two orders of magnitude lower than\nthat found in galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs)\n(Apponi & Ziurys 1997). However, the H13 CO+ spec-\n\ntra are derived from interferometric data. In order to\nasses the amount of missed flux (and hence the H13 CO+\ncolumn density), we have compared our results to those\nof HCO+ from Nguyen-Q-Rieu et al. (1992), which were\nobtained by single-dish observations. From our H13 CO+\nspectra, we obtain N(H13 CO+ )\u223c5\u00d71011 cm\u22122 across\nthe galaxy. Assuming a 12 C/13 C ratio of 89, this\nimplies N(HCO+ )\u223c4.5\u00d71013 cm\u22122 . This value is in\nagreement within a factor of 1.5 with previous estimate by Nguyen-Q-Rieu et al. (1992). Thus, even in\nthe most conservative case we can conclude that the\n[HCO+ ]/[HOC+ ] ratio is < 80 in the M82 disk. Such low\nvalues of the [HCO+ ]/[HOC+ ] ratio have only been found\nin the galactic reflection nebula NGC 7023 (Fuente et al.\n2003) and in the active nucleus of NGC 1068 (Usero et al.\n2004) and put severe constraints to the ionization degree\nof the molecular gas in M82.\n4. PHOTON-DOMINATED CHEMISTRY IN M82\n\nSternberg & Dalgarno (1995) found from detailed\nmodeling that [CN]/[HCN]>1 arises naturally in the surface layers (Av <4 mag) of dense PDRs. Values of the\n[CN]/[HCN] ratio between 1\u20133 have been found in prototypical dense galactic PDRs (Fuente et al. 1993, 1995,\n1996). We have derived [CN]/[HCN] ratios \u223c5 in all positions across the M82 nucleus suggesting that the molecular clouds in this galaxy are bathed in an intense UV field.\nTo determine the averaged physical conditions of these\nclouds, we have carried out model calculations using the\nplane-parallel PDR model developed by Le Bourlot and\ncollaborators (Le Bourlot et al. 1993). The model includes 135 species (HOC+ , CH3 C2 H and HC3 N are not\nincluded) and standard gas-phase reactions. Adopting\nG0 \u223c104 (Wolfire et al. 1990) and a total hydrogen nuclei density nH = nHI +2\u00d7nH2 =4\u00d7105 cm\u22123 , the model\n>\npredicts that [CN]/[HCN] ratios \u223c5 are only expected in\nregions at Av <5\u20136 mag (see left panels of Fig. 2). This\nimplies an important limit to the cloud sizes in the nucleus of M82. Since the clouds are bathed in a pervasive UV field, the averaged column density of individual\nclouds should be NH2 \u223c1022 cm\u22122 in order to have averaged [CN]/[HCN] ratios \u223c5.\nStrong constraints are also derived from the HOC+\nobservations. We have measured a [HCO+ ]/[HOC+ ] ratio of \u223c 40 in the M82 disk. A simple calculation of\nthe CO+ /HCO+ /HOC+ chemical network shows that\na high ionization degree, X(e\u2212 )> 10\u22125 , is required to\nhave [HCO+ ]/[HOC+ ]<80 (Usero et al. 2004). Our PDR\nmodel shows that this high electron abundance is only\nfound at Av <4 mag (see left panels of Fig. 2). This implies that the averaged column density of the clouds in\nthe nucleus of M82 is N(H2 )<8\u00d71021 cm\u22122 . Thus, the\nM82 nucleus seems to be formed by small (r\u223c0.02-0.2\npc) and dense (n\u223c104 \u2013105 cm\u22123 ) clouds immersed in a\nUV field of G0 \u223c104. Mao et al. (2000) estimated similar column densities for the clouds in the inner 400 pc\ndisk of M82 by modeling of the 12 CO, 13 CO and C18 O\nlines. Low values of the [HCO+ ]/[HOC+ ] ratio are also\nfound in XDRs with high ionization degree, such us active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (Usero et al. 2004). However,\nthe PAH emission is very low in AGNs since the doubly ionized PAHs produced by X-rays are very unstable\n(Leach et al. 1989). The intense PAH emission observed\nin M82 (Normand et al. 1995; F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n\n\fPDR chemistry in M82\n2003) indicates that X-rays are not the driving agent of\nthe molecular gas chemistry in this galaxy.\n5. HYDROCARBON CHEMISTRY\n\nThe hydrocarbon chemistry in PDRs has been a subject of increasing interest both from the theoretical and\nthe observational point of view. Recent works have revealed that the c-C3 H2 abundance in PDRs is similar\nto that in dark clouds. This is quite surprising taking\ninto account that this carbon cycle is easily photodissociated. In fact, PDR gas-phase models fall short of\nexplaining the observed c-C3 H2 and C4 H abundances by\nan order of magnitude (Teyssier et al. 2004; Pety et al.\n2004). This is clearly seen when one compares the [cC3 H2 ]/[HC3 N] ratio in PDRs and dark clouds (see Table\n1). While both species have similar abundances in dark\nclouds, the [c-C3 H2 ]/[HC3 N] ratio is >10 in PDRs. Since\nboth molecules are easily destroyed by photodissociation,\nthis suggests the existence of an additional c-C3 H2 formation mechanism in PDRs. Several authors have proposed formation processes of small hydrocarbons linked\nto the PAHs chemistry (Teyssier et al. 2004; Pety et al.\n2004). We have detected widespread emission of C2 H\nand c-C3 H2 in the M82 disk. However, we have not detected HC3 N towards any position. The derived upper\nlimits to the HC3 N column density in M82 show that the\n[c-C3 H2 ]/[HC3 N] ratio is at least a factor of 10 larger in\nthis starburst galaxy than in the prototypical galactic\ndark cloud TMC 1, and is similar to that found in dense\ngalactic PDRs (see Table 1). This result reinforces the\nscenario where the inner 650 pc region of M82 is a giant\nPDR.\nIn addition to C2 H and c-C3 H2 , we have detected\nCH3 C2 H in all the positions across the M82 disk. This\ndetection is rather puzzling since this molecule is easily\nphotodissociated in regions exposed to intense UV fields\nand therefore its abundance is expected to be very\nlow in these regions. Furthermore, this molecule is\nnot detected in prototypical galactic PDRs, like the\nHorsehead, which is known to be specially rich in carbon\ncompounds (Teyssier et al. 2004; Pety et al. 2004). One\npossibility is that the CH3 C2 H emission arises in a\npopulation of clouds similar to the galactic GMCs.\nThe molecule CH3 C2 H is quite abundant in GMCs,\npresenting similar abundances to those of chemically\nrelated species like CH3 OH and CH3 CN. The same\nbehavior is observed in other prototypical starburst\ngalaxies like NGC 253 where [CH3 C2 H]/[CH3 OH]\u223c1\nand\n[CH3 C2 H]/[CH3 CN]\n\u223c8.\nHowever,\n[CH3 C2 H]/[CH3 OH]>8 and [CH3 C2 H]/[CH3 CN]>25\nin M82 (Mauersberger et al. 1991; Huettemeister et al.\n1997), i.e., a factor 3\u201310 larger than in NGC 253. These\nabundance ratios show that the hydrocarbon chemistry\nin M82 is very different from that of GMCs.\nWe think that the over-abundance of CH3 C2 H is\nalso related to the enhanced UV flux in this galaxy.\nIn fact, CH3 C2 H and CH3 C4 H has been detected by\nCernicharo et al. (2001) in the C-rich proto-planetary\nnebula CRL 618. This nebula is specially rich in complex\ncarbon compounds, in particular, polyynes (C2n+2 H2 )\nand methylpolyynes (CH3 C2n H). They argued that the\nformation of these complex molecules has started by the\nphotolysis of acetylene (C2 H2 ) and methane (CH4 ), both\nprocesses occurring in the inner PDR of the planetary\n\n3\n\nnebula. The photo-erosion of PAHs could also contribute\nto enhance the abundance of these molecules by releasing\nsmall carbon chains and acetylene to the gas phase.\n6. A GLOBAL SCENARIO FOR THE CHEMISTRY IN M82\n\nThe observations presented in this paper show that\nthe strong UV flux drives the chemistry of the molecular gas in the M82 disk. In this Letter, we explore\nwhether the PDR chemistry can solely account for all\nthe molecular abundances measured in this galaxy so\nfar. For this aim, we compare the molecular abundances in M82 to those of the prototypical starburst\nNGC 253. Molecules such as NH3 , CH3 OH, CH3 CN, SO,\nSiO and HC3 N are clearly under-abundant in M82 compared to NGC 253 (Weiss et al. 2001; Huettemeister et al.\n1997; Mauersberger et al. 1991; Takano, et al. 1995;\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2000, 2001). All these molecules\nare easily photodissociated and are not expected in a\nPDR. Other species such as CS, CN, HCN and HCO+\npresent fractional abundances \u223c a few 10\u22129 in M82\nwhich are very similar to those measured in NGC 253\n(Mauersberger & Henkel 1989). These molecules belong\nto the reduced group of species which have significant\nabundances at Av <5 mag in our PDR model (see left\npanels of Fig. 2). However, our model predicts abundances a factor of 10 lower than those observed. Cosmic rays and/or shocks could contribute to enhance the\nabundances of these species.\nTo investigate the possible effect of the enhanced cosmic ray flux on the chemistry, we have repeated the\nmodel calculations with an enhanced cosmic rays flux\nof \u03b6=4\u00d710\u221215 s\u22121 . This is the value estimated by\nSuchkov et al. (1993) to account for the physical conditions of the molecular gas in M82 and is, very likely,\nan upper limit to the actual cosmic ray flux. The enhanced cosmic rays flux does not change significantly the\nvalue of the [CN]/[HCN] ratio and the ionization degree\nat Av <5 mag (see right panels of Fig. 2). However, the\nfractional abundances of HCN, CN and CS averaged over\nthe region at Av <5 mag are a factor of 10 larger than\nthose obtained with the standard value \u03b6=5\u00d710\u221217 s\u22121 .\nMoreover, these values are in reasonable agreement with\nthe observational results in M82. Thus, by including the\nenhanced cosmic ray flux we get a better fit of the model\nto the observational results. However, the HCO+ abundance still remains a factor of 10 lower than the observed\none.\nSome of the underabundant species in M82 like SiO\nare well known shock chemistry tracers. This suggests that shocks are not the dominant mechanism at\nwork in the galaxy disk. The SiO map reported by\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. (2001) show that shocks are not occurring in the galaxy disk but in the disk-halo interface\nbecause of the hot gas coming out of the plane in the\nnucleus of M82. This is consistent with the interpretation of M82 as an evolved starburst compared to NGC\n253. While in NGC 253 the molecular chemistry is determined by the shocks associated with the early stages of\nstar formation, in M82 it is determined by the UV radiation produced by evolved stars and the enhanced cosmic\nrays flux (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2002).\nWe are grateful to the technical staff in Pico de Veleta\nfor their supporting during observations.
