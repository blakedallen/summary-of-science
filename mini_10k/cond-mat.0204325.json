It is\ntested for the generic cases of dephasing due to an Anderson-Weiss process and due to restricted\ndiffusion in a linear field gradient.\n87.59.Pw, 76.60.Jx\n\na number of analytical results were obtained for it [1].\nThe characteristic of this limit is that the mean phase\nshift induced by a field realization is much smaller than\none, i.e. |\u03b4\u03c6| = \u03c4 h\u2206\u03c9 2 i1/2 \u226a 1, where the correlation time \u03c4 gives the mean duration of some field realization, and h\u2206\u03c9 2 i is the variance of the inhomogeneous field. The relaxation time is then obtained as\n1/T2 = \u03c4 h\u2206\u03c9 2 i. In the other limiting case, i.e. the\nstatic dephasing regime (\u03c4 h\u2206\u03c9 2 i1/2 \u226b 1), Yablonski [2]\nderived analytical expressions for coherent dephasing of\nspins in inhomogeneous fields around magnetic centers\nlike cylinders or spheres. Kiselev [3] extended Yablonski's static dephasing approach by considering diffusion\nof spins within local linear gradients. However, this approach requires that the diffusion length l during dephasing is within the linear approximation of the inhomogeneous fields \u03c9(x0 + l) \u2248 \u03c9(x0 ) + \u2202x \u03c9(x0 ) l. Note that\nexpansion around the limiting cases by perturbation approaches leads to divergences in the respective other limits. Therefore, the intermediate motion regime, i.e. almost everything between the static dephasing and motional narrowing limit, was in most situations accessible\nby simulations only [5].\nRecently, we used a strong collision (SC) approach\nto characterize spin dephasing in a particular situation:\nAn inhomogeneous field around regularly arranged parallel cylinders filled with a paramagnetic substance [4],\na model reflecting the capillary network of the cardiac\nmuscle. The results agreed well with simulations [5] over\nthe whole dynamic range, and with experimental data\n[6,7].\nThe basic idea behind the SC approach is to replace\nthe original generator of the Markov process by a simpler\none, the SC generator, that conserves particular features\nof the original process. In particular, by an appropriate\nchoice of its parameter the SC process reproduces the\ncorrelation time of the field fluctuations induced by the\noriginal Markov process. There are several advantages\nof the SC approximation. First, it is is correct both in\nthe motional narrowing and the static dephasing limits;\nthereby also the error in the intermediate regime is re-\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe understanding of spin dephasing is of paramount\ninterest in all fields of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nsciences. In NMR spectroscopy it determines the line\nshape, in NMR imaging it is \u2013 besides longitudinal relaxation \u2013 the major mechanism determining the contrast\nand contains morphological as well as functional information.\nThe processes contributing to spin dephasing are related to the spin environment. In biological tissues, for\nexample, spin dephasing may result from dipole-dipole\ninteraction of water proton spins with paramagnetic ions\nlike Fe2+ . Another cause is diffusion within inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by native or contrast\nagent induced susceptibility differences that are related\nto tissue composition and/or cellular and sub cellular\ncompartments. In magnetic resonance imaging spin dephasing in external gradient fields is exploited to get\ninformation about diffusion within biological systems.\nThese diffusion sensitive imaging techniques are applied\nto study tissue anisotropy and restrictions of diffusion\nthat are given by membranes of cells and sub cellular\nstructures.\nEssential for dephasing of spins are the field fluctuations that induce the phase modulations. It is important\nto note that in biological tissues the relevant processes\ncover almost the whole range of time scales. For example, the dynamics of interactions of water proton spins\nwith paramagnetic macromolecules as ferritin is so fast\nthat it can be considered to be within the motional narrowing regime. On the other hand, dephasing of spins\nin magnetic field gradients around larger vessels is almost coherent. i.e. it is in the static dephasing regime\n[2]. Hence, for biological applications it is important to\nobtain results from theory that are valid over the whole\nmotion regime. However, in most cases this is not possible analytically.\nTherefore, most efforts have focused on limiting cases.\nThe motional narrowing limit is well investigated and\n1\n\n\fmagnetization. Equation (1) then provides the time evolution of the transverse magnetization (free induction decay) as\n\nduced considerably, when compared to perturbation approaches. And second, it provides a simple expression\nfor the magnetization decay which may be solved analytically or at least numerically.\nHowever, the drawback of the SC approach was \u2013 up\nto now \u2013 that is not part of a systematic approximation\nto or an expansion of the original generator. Therefore,\nit was unclear how results could be improved beyond the\nSC approximation. The aim of this paper is to extend the\nSC approach and provide a framework for a systematic\napproximation.\nIn the next section we will present a formal description\nof spin dephasing that will be the basis for our analytical analysis. In Sect. III we will introduce the extended\nstrong collision (ESC) approximation proper and show\nhow it is used to describe free induction and spin echo\ndecay. In Sect. IV we will apply it to two generic cases:\nspin dephasing induced by an Anderson-Weiss process [8]\nand by restricted diffusion in a linear field gradient. We\nwill close the paper with a summary and a discussion of\nour results.\n\n|m(t)i = exp[(R + i\u03a9) t] |0i ,\n\nwhere the initial magnetization was normalized to one.\nThe overall magnetization is then determined as\nM (t) = h0|m(t)i\n= h0| exp [(R + i\u03a9) t] |0i .\n\n(3)\n\nThe free induction decay as determined by Eqs. (2) and\n(3) results from coherent and incoherent spin dephasing.\nThe incoherent contribution is determined from spin echo\nexperiments. In-plane polarized spins are rotated by a\n1800 (\u03c0-pulse) after a time t/2. This pulse transforms\nthe original magnetization |m(t/2)i to its complex adjoint |m\u2217 (t/2)i = exp[(R \u2212 i\u03a9) t/2] |0i. This procedure\ncancels the coherent spin dephasing after the time t (echo\ntime), i.e. the decay of magnetization at t is solely due\nto incoherent spin dephasing. The time course of the\nmagnetization after the pulse, i.e. for times t\u2032 > t/2, is\ndetermined by\n\nII. FORMAL DESCRIPTION OF\nSPIN-DEPHASING\n\n|m(t\u2032 )i = exp[(R + i \u03a9)(t\u2032 \u2212 t/2)] exp[(R \u2212 i\u03a9)t/2]|0i ,\n\nWe assume that dephasing of transversely polarized\nnuclear spins exposed to an external field is induced by\nrandomly fluctuating magnetic perturbation fields with\nfrequency \u03c9i , where i is a discrete or continuous variable.\nThe transition dynamics between two distinct states i\nand j is that of a stationary continuous time Markov process described by rates rji for the transition i \u2192 j. The\nmatrix R = (rji ) as the generator of the Markov process\nconserves thePprobability to find a spin within one state,\ni.e. rii = \u2212 j6=i rji . The eigenvalues l of R fulfill the\ncondition l \u2264 0 where l = 0 corresponds to the equilibrium probability distribution. To simplify the notation\nwe denote the normalized left and right eigenvectors of\nR as hl| and |li, respectively, with hl\u2032 |li = \u03b4l\u2032 l .\nThe time evolution between t and t + dt of the transverse magnetization of spins in the state j (in polar notation mj = mj x \u2212 imj y ) results from the linear superposition of theP\ntransition and the precession dynamics,\ni.e. \u2202t mj (t) = j rji mi (t) + i \u03c9j mj (t). The precession\nwithin the external field was omitted since it only induces\na constant offset of the frequency which may be gauged\nto zero. With the diagonal frequency matrix \u03a9 = (\u03b4ji \u03c9i )\none obtains for the magnetization |mi = (mj )\n\u2202t |m(t)i = (R + i\u03a9) |m(t)i ,\n\n(2)\n\n(4)\ni.e. the overall spin echo magnetization at the echo time\nt is\nMSE (t) = h0| exp[(R + i \u03a9)t/2] exp[(R \u2212 i\u03a9) t/2] |0i\n= hm(t/2)|m\u2217 (t/2)i .\n(5)\nEquation (5) relates the overall spin echo magnetization\nto the magnetization of the free induction decay.\nIII. THE STRONG COLLISION\nAPPROXIMATION AND ITS EXTENSION\n\nThe analytical determination of the free induction decay according to Eqs. (3) is restricted to very few cases,\ne.g. free diffusion in a linear gradient or stochastic fluctuations between two precession frequencies. The idea\nof the strong collision approach and its extension is to\nreplace the generator of the Markov process R by a more\nsimple generator D that conserves specific features of the\noriginal dynamics.\n\n(1)\n\nA. Strong Collision Approximation\n\nwhich is a generalization of the Bloch Torrey equation\n[9] originally formulated for diffusing spins, i.e. R \u223c \u22072 .\nIn most cases it is reasonable to assume that the initial\nmagnetization |m(0)i is proportional to the equilibrium\nprobability distribution |0i, e.g. when free diffusion is\nconsidered this would imply a homogeneous transverse\n\nIn many cases the stochastic fluctuations of the perturbation fields occur on a much shorter time scale than\nspin-dephasing, i.e. the correlation time \u03c4 of field fluctuations is much shorter than the relaxation time of the\nmagnetization. For ergodic Markov processes one can\n2\n\n\festimate that after a few \u03c4 a spin has visited almost all\nrelevant states with the equilibrium probability. On the\nother hand, there is only little change of the magnetization during this time interval. Therefore, spin dephasing in this situation can be described equivalently by a\nprocess in which the transition rate between two states\ni \u2192 j is independent of the initial state. Consequently,\nthe transition rate for i \u2192 j is proportional to the equilibrium probability of the final state, p0,j . Such a dynamics\nis referred to as strong collision dynamics.\nThe generator D of this process has the form\nD = \u2212\u03bb (id \u2212 \u03a00 )\n\nR=\n\nD = l0 \u03a00 \u2212 \u03bb (id \u2212 \u03a00 )\n\nD\u2032 n =\n\n(8)\n\n(\u03bb) = \u03c42 .\n\n(13)\n\n2\nwith \u03c90i = h0|\u03a9|ii and c2 (0) = h0|\u03a92 |0i \u2212 \u03c900\n. Note that\nfor n \u2192 0 this equation becomes (10) again.\nHowever, there are several problems involved with an\napproximation based on (13) and (14). Practically, an exact determination of the low order eigenvalues and eigenvectors is possible only in special cases. Therefore, one\nhas to deal with the problem that the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors are known either only approximately or not\nat all. Furthermore, even with eigenvalues and eigenfunctions known, it turns out that the ESC' approximation\nmay be not applicable at all in certain situations: If the\nautocorrelation function of the field fluctuations is determined fully by the eigenfunctions included in D\u2032 , Eq. (14)\nis undetermined. In that case additional self-consistency\nrequirements would be necessary for a better description\nof the intermediate time regime.\nNevertheless, the above approach can be readily\nadapted to these situations. Equation (13) can be viewed\nas an optimized reduced description of the relaxation in\n\n(9)\n\nIt is easy to determine that the correlation time for the\n(SC)\n(\u03bb) = \u03bb\u22121 , see the\nstrong collision approximation is \u03c42\nappendix Eq.

(13) will be referred to as simplified extended strong collision (ESC'n ) approximation\nof order n. As before, the contribution of the higher\neigenvalues is approximated by the parameter \u03bb, which\nis determined again self-consistently from condition (9).\nHere it leads to\nPn\n2\nc2 (0) \u2212 j=1 |\u03c90i |\n\u03bb=\n,\n(14)\nPn \u22121\n2\nc2 (0)\u03c42 + j=1 lj |\u03c90i |\n\nStochastic field fluctuations determined by the strong collision (SC) process should have the same correlation time\nas the original process, leading to the self-consistency\ncondition\n(SC)\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nwhich is defined as\nZ \u221e\nC2 (t) \u2212 C2 (\u221e)\ndt\n\u03c42 =\nC\n2 (0) \u2212 C2 (\u221e)\n0\n\n\u03c42\n\n(12)\n\n(note that l0 = 0), shows that in the strong collision approximation just the lowest order term of (11)\nis taken into account explicitly, while the contribution\nof the higher eigenvalues is approximated by the selfconsistently determined parameter \u03bb.\nA natural extension, therefore, would be to take into\naccount more low order eigenvalues explicitly, thereby increasing the accuracy of the description of the long-time\nbehavior:\n\n(7)\n\nh0|\u03a9 [exp(Rt) \u2212 \u03a00 ] \u03a9|0i\nh0|\u03a92 |0i \u2212 h0|\u03a9|0i2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere l0 = 0 > l1 > . . . are the ordered eigenvalues of\nR and \u03a0j = |jihj| is the projection operator onto the\neigenspace corresponding\nto lj . Since the time evolution\nP\u221e\noperator is exp(R t) = j=0 elj t \u03a0j , it is clear that the\nlow order eigenvalues determine the long-time behavior,\nwhile higher orders dominate shorter and shorter time\nscales.

The factor \u03bb has\nto be determined self consistently.\nSince the starting point of the strong collision approximation is the observation that - in many cases of interest - the correlation of the stochastic field fluctuations\nappear on a shorter time scale than that of changes of the\nmagnetization, only the long time behavior of the field\nfluctuations is of importance. This long time behavior\nis characterized by the correlation time of the two-point\nautocorrelation function of the field fluctuations (see also\nthe appendix),\n\n=\n\nlj \u03a0j ,\n\nj=0\n\n(6)\n\nC2 (t) = h\u03c9(t)\u03c9(0)i\n= h0|\u03a9 exp(Rt)\u03a9|0i ,\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(10)\n\nB. Extended Strong Collision Approximation\n\nThe extension of the strong collision approximation is\nbased on a comparison with the spectral expansion of the\noriginal operator,\n3\n\n\fwhich does not necessarily vanish. In the strong collision approximation we avoided this problem by considering the operator [exp(Rt) \u2212 \u03a00 ] instead of exp(Rt) in\nEq. (8), i.e. we considered only the relaxational part\nof the stochastic process. When we perform the same\nreplacement in Eq. (17) we obtain modified correlation\nfunctions cm (tm\u22121 , . . . , t1 ) that we will call quasi cumulants (s. appendix). They vanish asymptotically for all\nt\u03bd . We now require that the generalized correlation times\nderived from these quasi cumulants,\n\nvarious subspaces of the original operator R. Such a optimized description should also be possible for subspaces\nthat are not eigenvectors of R. We can, therefore, set\nDn = \u2212\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03bbj \u03a0j \u2212 \u03bb(id \u2212 \u03a0) .\n\n(15)\n\nHowever, now the rates \u03bbj , j = 1, . . . , n are not eigenvalues anymore, but have to be determined by additional\nself-consistency requirements, see below. Moreover, the\n\u03a0j are not projectors onto the eigenspace of a particular eigenvalue, but onto the spaces defined by arbitrarily\nchosen mutually orthogonal functions |fj i, j = 1, . . . , n,\nwith hfi |fj i = \u03b4ij and hfj |0i = 0; i.e. thePprojectors have\nn\nthe form \u03a0j = |fj ihfj | and \u03a0 = \u03a00 + j=1 \u03a0j . Naturally, one would try to choose the functions |fj i close to\nthe eigenfunctions |ji, although it is not required for the\nextension to work. Another natural function space for\nexample is based on polynomials in the frequency operator \u03a9, i.e.\n|fi i = pi (\u03a9)|0i ,\n\nm\u22121\n\u03c4m\n=\n\n= h0|\u03a9 exp(Rtm\u22121 )\u03a9... exp(Rt1 )\u03a9|0i .\n\n\u03a0m\u22121\ni=1 dti\n\ncm (tm\u22121 , . . . , t1 )\n,\ncm (0, . . . , 0)\n\n(ESC n )\n\u03c4m\n(\u03bb, \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) = \u03c4m ,\nm = 2, 4 . . . , 2n + 2 ,\n\n(16)\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwhich replace the single self-consistency condition (9).\nNote that in many systems the correlation functions\ncm (tm\u22121 , . . . , t1 ) vanish for odd values of m due to symmetry. Therefore, we require the equivalence of relaxation times in Eq. (20) for even values of m only. Otherwise one has to determine the correlation times of the\nfirst n + 1 non-vanishing correlation functions.\nIt is important to emphasize some properties of the\nESC approximation. First of all, it usually does not reduce to the ESC' approximation when eigenfunctions are\nused for the projection operator; i.e. the \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn do\nnot take on the numerical values of the corresponding\neigenvalues, although they usually do approximate them.\nIn the light of the problems with the ESC' approximations mentioned above, it will turn out that this is an\nadvantage: the self-consistent determination of the relaxation parameters \u03bb, and \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn according to Eq. (20)\nis more balanced than when only Eq. (9) is used, and\ngives rise to an improved approximation. Moreover,\nthe self-consistency conditions (20) imply that both processes, the ESC process and the original Markov process\nhave the same motional narrowing expansion of the transverse relaxation, as it is shown in the appendix, Eq. (B7).\n\n(17)\n\nFollowing the same arguments as for the strong collision\napproximation, the long time behavior of the Cm is of\ninterest. In the same way as for the strong collision approximation this should be characterized by some first\norder statistical moment which is obtained by integration of the correlation function over tm\u22121 , ..., t1 . However, direct usage of Cm is hampered by its non-vanishing\nasymptotic behavior: It is easily seen that from the relation limt\u03bd \u2192\u221e exp(Rt\u03bd ) = \u03a00 follows\n\nC. Transverse Spin Relaxation in the Extended\nStrong Collision Approximation\n\nIn this section we will exploit the simple structure of\nthe generator Dn to determine the time course of magnetization. We will consider both: the free induction\ndecay, i.e. the superposition of coherent and incoherent\nspin dephasing, and the spin echo decay, i.e. pure incoherent spin dephasing.\n\nlim Cm (tm\u22121 , .., t1 ) = Cm\u2212\u03bd (tm\u22121 , .., t\u03bd+1 )\u00d7\n\nt\u03bd \u2192\u221e\n\nC\u03bd (t\u03bd\u22121 , .., t1 ) ,\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nare equal for the exact process and for the extended\nstrong collision description. The relaxation rates are,\ntherefore, determined by\n\nwhere pi is some polynomial of degree i, the coefficients\nof which are chosen in such a way that the orthonormal\nrelations are fulfilled. In the following we will refer to\nthis base of functions as the \u03a9-base.\nIn analogy to Eq. (13) a stochastic process generated\nby an operator Dn in Eq. (15) will be referred to as extended strong collision (ESCn ) approximation of order n.\nIt is evident that the ESC0 approximation refers to the\nstrong collision approximation.\nWe mentioned already that the rates \u03bbj , j = 1, . . . , n,\nin Eq. (15) have to be determined now by additional selfconsistency requirements. As it was with the SC approximation, the aim of the ESCn approximation is to\napproximate more closely the correlation of field fluctuations. This is achieved by considering also higher order\ncorrelation functions\nCm (tm\u22121 , . . . , t1 ) =\n\u0011\nE\nD \u0010P\nm\u22121\n.\n.\n.\n\u03c9(t\n+\nt\n)\u03c9(t\n)\u03c9(0)\n\u03c9\nt\n2\n1\n1\nj\nj=1\n\nZ\n\n(18)\n4\n\n\f2. Spin-Echo Decay\n\n1. Free Induction Decay\n\nIn the extended strong collision approximation the generator R of the free induction decay in the generalized\nBloch Torrey Equation (1) is replaced by the generator Dn of Eq. (15). Instead of solving the propagator\nU(t) = exp((Dn + i\u03a9)t) it is more convenient to solve its\nLaplace transform \u00db(s) = (s \u2212 Dn \u2212 i\u03a9)\u22121 which may\nbe expanded as\n\u00db(s) = \u00db0 (s + \u03bb) + \u00db0 (s + \u03bb) \u039b \u00db(s)\n\nThe spin-echo decay is obtained by inserting of the\ngenerator Dn into Eq. (5), i.e.\n\u2202t MSE,[n] (t) = \u2212\u03bb MSE,[n] (t) + hm(t/2)|\u039b|m\u2217 (t/2)i\n= \u2212\u03bb MSE,[n] (t) + h0|U(t/2)\u039bU\u2217 (t/2)|0i\n= \u2212\u03bb MSE,[n] (t) + h0|U\u03a0 (t/2)\u039bU\u2217 \u03a0 (t/2)|0i\n(27)\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u00db0 (s) = (s \u2212 i\u03a9)\u22121 is the Laplace transform in\nthe static dephasing limit (Dn = 0), and the operator \u039b\nis defined as\nn\nX\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbj ) \u03a0j ,\n(22)\n\u039b=\n\ni.e. the spin-echo decay is expressed as a function of the\nspin-echo amplitude MSE , and the projection of the free\ninduction decay onto the subspace [ |0i, |f1 i, ..., |fn i ], i.e.\nU\u03a0 (t)|0i. This projection of the free induction decay is\nobtained from Eq. (24)by inverse Laplace transform, i.e.\nU\u03a0 (t)|0i = L\u22121 (\u00db\u03a0 (s)|0i). The solution of Eq. (27) is\n\nj=0\n\nwhere we set \u03bb0 = 0. We will now confine the operators in Eq. (21) onto P\nthe subspace defined by the pron\njection operator \u03a0 = j=0 \u03a0j . Using the abbreviation\n\u03a0\nO := \u03a0 O \u03a0 for denoting any operator O confined to\nthat subspace, we obtain\n\u03a0\n\u03a0\n\u03a0\n\u00db\u03a0 (s) = \u00db\u03a0\n0 (s + \u03bb) + \u00db0 (s + \u03bb) \u039b \u00db (s) ,\n\n\"\n\nMSE,[n] (t) = e\u2212\u03bbt 1 + 2\n\n1 \u2212 M\u0302sd (s + \u03bb) \u03bb\n\nThe free induction and the spin echo decay are usually\ndescribed by the time constants T2\u2217 and T2 . However,\nthere is no unique definition of these parameters. One\ndefinition of the relaxation times is\n1/T2\u2217 = \u2212 ln(M (t))/t\n1/T2 = \u2212 ln(MSE )/t .\n\n(29)\n\nFor the ESC decay one has to replace M by M[n] and\nMSE by MSE,[n] . This definition implies a dependence\nof relaxation times on t, except for single exponential\ndecay.\nAnother definition of relaxation times is based on the\nassumption that these constants provide the best single\nexponential approximation\nof magnetization decays, i.e.\n\u2217\nM (t) \u2248 e\u2212t/T2 , MSE \u2248 e\u2212t/T2 . According to the mean\nrelaxation time approximation the relaxation times are\nthen the first long time moments of the decays [10], i.e.\n\n(25)\n\n.\n\nd\u03bee2\u03bb\u03be h0|U\u03a0 (\u03be)\u039bU\u2217\u03a0 (\u03be)|0i\n\n3. Time Constants of Transverse Relaxation\n\nFor the special case of the strong collision approximation,\nESC0 , Eqs. (24) and (25) result in\nM\u0302sd (s + \u03bb)\n\n0\n\n#\n\n(28)\n\nThe Laplace transform of the overall magnetization decay M\u0302[n] (s) in the extended strong collision approximation has the form\n\nM\u0302[0] (s) =\n\nt/2\n\n(23)\n\nwhere we exploited the fact that \u039b = \u03a0 \u039b \u03a0 and\nthe idempotency of projection operators, i.e. \u03a0 =\n\u03a02 . Equation (23) is of fundamental importance. It\ndemonstrates that the relation (21) between the ESCapproximation and the static dephasing is also valid in\nthe subspace [ |0i, |f1 i, .., |fn i ]. This simplifies determination of spin relaxation considerably since one only has\nto determine the (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrices 1 of the static\ndephasing limit \u00db\u03a0\n0 and \u039b, i.e.\n\u0001\n\u03a0 \u22121\n\u00db\u03a0\n(24)\n\u00db\u03a0 (s) = \u03a0 \u2212 \u00db\u03a0\n0 (s + \u03bb) .\n0 (s + \u03bb) \u039b\n\nM\u0302[n] (s) = h0| \u00db\u03a0 (s) |0i\n\nZ\n\n(26)\n\nwith M\u0302sd (s) = h0|\u00db0 (s + \u03bb)|0i as the Laplace transform of the overall magnetization in the static dephasing\nregime. The time evolution M (t) can be obtained from\nEqs (24) and (25) either by numerical inverse Laplace\ntransform or using the generalized moment approach\n[4,10] which allows a multi-exponential approximation.\n\nT2\u2217 := \u03bc\u22121 (M ) =\n\n1\nin case of degeneracy of the eigenvalues the matrix dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces plus one\n\n5\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndt M (t)\n\n\fT2 := \u03bc\u22121 (MSE ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt MSE (t)\n\nThis implies that the spin echo relaxation time is almost\nidentical with the relaxation time of the absolute squared\nmagnetization of the free induction decay, or vice versa\nthat the free induction decay is almost irreversible.\n\n(30)\n\n0\n\nFor a single exponential the mean relaxation time definition and the definitions (29) give the same results. According to definition (30) the relaxation times of the ESC\ndecays can be related to their Laplace transforms as\nT2\u2217 = M\u0302[n] (0)\nT2 = M\u0302SE,[n] (0) ,\n\nThe dissipation-fluctuation-coherence relation (32)\ntakes a very simple form in the strong collision approximation, when we assume that the overall magnetization\ndecay is well approximated\nby a single exponential, i.e.\n\u2217\nM[0] (t) \u2248 e\u2212t/T 2 .

Anderson-Weiss Model\n\nThe Anderson-Weiss model [8] is one of the rare approaches \u2013 besides the ESC approximation \u2013 which describes spin dephasing over the whole dynamic range of\nstochastic field fluctuations. The approach is suitable,\nfor example, when dephasing is induced by spin interaction with a great number of independently fluctuating\nperturbation fields in the spin environment. Then analytical results are obtained for the free induction and the\nspin echo magnetization decay as\n\nare transit times describing the transient occurrence of\nthe non-equilibrium components of the free induction decay U(t)|fi i. Equation (32) relates T2 which describes\nthe incoherent, i.e. irreversible, component of spin dephasing to the stochastic field dynamics (\u03bb, \u03bbi ) and time\nconstants of the free induction decay (\u0398i ), i.e. Eq. (32)\nis a dissipation-fluctuation-coherence relation. Note that\nthe Eqs. (33) to (34) directly relate the time constants\n\u0398i to the Laplace transform of the free induction decay\n\u00db\u03a0 (s) given by the fundamental Equation (23).\n\u00bfFrom Eq. (32) one can derive asymptotic relations\nfor very fast and slow stochastic field fluctuations. Let\n\u01eb be some scaling parameter of Dn , i.e. \u03bb, \u03bbi \u223c \u01eb, then\nEq.

In this section we will first characterize\nthe class of Markovian processes which fulfills the conditions of the Anderson-Weiss model. This leads to a\ngeneralized Bloch-Torrey equation according to Eq. (1)\nwhich is solved. Finally we compare the Anderson-Weiss\nmodel with its ESC0 and ESC1 approximation.\n\nwhere we exploited that \u0398i (\u01eb) approaches its finite static\ndephasing limit. For very fast fluctuations i.e. in the\nmotional narrowing limit (\u01eb \u2192 \u221e) one exploits that\nhfi |\u00db(s)|0i/h0|\u00db(s)|0i \u223c \u01eb\u22121 , as a power expansion\ndemonstrates, i.e. one obtains\nT2 \u2248 2 \u03980 .\n\nZ\n\n(36)\n6\n\n\f1. Markovian and Anderson-Weiss Dynamics\n\nhn + 1| = hn|(\u2202\u03c9 + \u03c9) , hn \u2212 1| = \u2212\n\nThe Anderson-Weiss approach is based on a Gaussian\ndistribution of perturbation field frequencies \u03c9. Even\nmore important is the additional assumptionR that the\nt\nstochastic phase accumulation of a spin \u03c6 = 0 d\u03be \u03c9(\u03be)\nalso exhibits a Gaussian distribution. This latter condition implies that the Greens function G(\u03c9j , \u03c9i , t), i.e. the\nprobability that a spin initially precessing with frequency\n\u03c9i precesses at t with \u03c9j , is also a Gaussian function in\n\u03c9j , \u03c9i with the condition G(\u03c9j , \u03c9i , 0) = \u03b4(\u03c9j \u2212 \u03c9i ). This\nimplies that only nearest neighbor transitions rates are\nnon-vanishing. Markovian processes in a continuous variable \u03c9 with this property are described equivalently by a\nFokker Planck Equation [11], i.e. the probability density\np(\u03c9) satisfies\n\u2202t p(\u03c9, t) = R p(\u03c9, t)\n= \u2202\u03c9 D(\u03c9)(\u2202\u03c9 \u2212 F (\u03c9)) p(\u03c9, t) ,\n\nm(\u03c9, t) = exp[\u03b2\u2202\u03c9 (\u2202\u03c9 + \u03c9) + i \u03c9]|0i\n= exp[\u2212\u03b2 \u22121 t + \u03b2 \u22122 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2t )]\n(2\u03c0)\u22121/2 exp[\u22121/2(\u03c9 \u2212 i \u03b2 \u22121 (e\u03b2t \u2212 1))] (46)\nIntegration over \u03c9 just gives the free induction decay of\nthe overall magnetization\n\n(40)\n\nM (t) = exp[\u2212\u03b2 \u22121 t + \u03b2 \u22122 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2t )]\n\nMSE (t) = M (t/2)2 exp[\u03b2 \u22122 (e\u2212\u03b2t/2 \u2212 1)2 ] .\n\n(41)\n\n2.

Spin Dephasing by Restricted Diffusion in a\nLinear Gradient Field\n\n1. The Exact Process\n\nWhereas dephasing of free diffusing spins in a linear\ngradient field can be treated analytically, only numerical solutions exists for the restricted diffusion case [12].\nOn the one hand restricted diffusion in a linear gradient\nfield provides a simple model to study principle features\nof spin dephasing by diffusion. On the other hand treatment of this problem is not only of academic interest as\nalready mentioned in the Introduction. We will approximate the free induction and spin echo decay of the global\nmagnetization for the case of restricted diffusion by the\nstrong collision approximation (ESC0 ) and its first extension (ESC1 ). The ESC1 approximation will be performed\nfor both, in the \u03a9-polynomial base, i.e. |f1 i \u223c \u03a9|0i and\nin the eigenfunction base, i.e. |f1 i = |1i.\nWe assume that the spins diffuse within an interval\nof size L in a linear gradient field \u03c9(x) = g x. Reflecting boundary conditions at x = \u00b1L/2 imply that\n\u2202x m(\u00b1L/2, t) \u2261 0. With D as the diffusion coefficient\nand R = D[\u2202x2 ] the Bloch-Torrey Eq. (1) has the form\n\u2202t m(x, t) = (D[\u2202x2 ] + igx)m(x, t), where the brackets [ ]\ndenote that application of the operator \u2202x2 is restricted to\nfunctions which fulfill the reflecting boundary conditions.\nTransformation of variables x \u2192 x/L and t \u2192 t g L results in\n\n(51)\n\nwhere the factor N generally is some normalization factor with N 2 = h0|\u03a92 |0i, i.e. in the case of the Anderson\nWeiss model it is simply N = 1. Consequently, using\nsome elementary rules of Laplace transforms, one derives\nthe other matrix elements as\nh1|\u00db0 (s)|0i = h0|\u00db0 (s)|1i\nh1|\u00db0 (s)|1i = N 2 s (1 \u2212 s h0|\u00db0 (s)|0i) ,\n\n(52)\n\nIt has to be stressed that the Equations (51) to (52) are\ngenerally valid for all ESC1 approximations in the \u03a9base.\nThe coefficients \u03bb, \u03bb1 guaranteeing the self consistency\ncondition Eq. (20) are obtained from Eqs. (D4,E2) and\n(D7,E4)\n\u03bb1 = \u03b2\n\u03bb = 2\u03b2\n\n(53)\n\nRelaxation in the ESC0 and ESC1 approximation\nThe matrix \u00db\u03a0\n0 (s) and the coefficients \u03bb and \u03bb1 determine the Laplace transformed ESC propagator \u00db\u03a0 (s) in\nEq. (24), which itself is the base for all other calculations.\nIt directly provides T2\u2217 when defined as the first moment,\nEq. (31), of the free induction decay Eq. (25). Insertion\nof \u00db\u03a0 (s) into Eqs. (33,34) provides according to Eq. (32)\nthe relaxation time of the spin echo decay when defined\nas its first long time moment Eq. (31). Inverse Laplace\ntransformation of \u00db\u03a0 (s) gives the ESC propagator U\u03a0 (t)\nwhich itself allows determination of the spin echo decay\nEq. (28).\nThe relaxation time T2\u2217 := \u03bc\u22121 (M ) of the AndersonWeiss process is well approximated by the ESC0 and\nESC1 approximation over the whole dynamic range of\nstochastic field fluctuations (Fig. 1). In the static\np dephas\u22121\ning regime all curves approach lim\u03b2\u21920 \u03bc\u22121\n= 2/\u03c0. The\nsuccessive approximation of the spin echo relaxation by\nthe ESC approximation is seen from the magnetization\ndecay curves (Fig. 2) and the curves showing the dependence of T2 obtained by either definition (Eqs. (29)-(30))\non the diffusion coefficient \u03b2 as Figure 3 demonstrates.\nThe latter curves all run parallel in the motional narrowing regime (\u03c41 (h0|\u03a92 |0i)1/2 = \u03b2 \u22121 \u226a 1) and exhibit\na similar location of the maximum relaxation rate. Towards the static dephasing regime (\u03b2 \u2192 0) the rate of\nthe Anderson-Weiss process declines less than the rates\nof the ESC processes.\n\n\u2202t m(x, t) = (\u03b2 [\u2202x2 ] + i x) m(x, t) ,\n\n(54)\n\nand vanishing derivatives at the edges of the unit interval\n\u2202x m(\u00b11/2, t) \u2261 0\n\n(55)\n\nwith the diffusion coefficient \u03b2 = D/(gL3 ). We continue\nto denote also the transformed variables as x and t to\nreduce the number of symbols. When the initial magnetization is proportional to the equilibrium probability,\ni.e. m(x, 0) \u2261 1, the Laplace transform m\u0302(x, s) of the\nlocal magnetization decay satisfies\n(\u03b2 [\u2202x2 ] + i x)m\u0302(x, s) = \u22121 .\n\n(56)\n\nThe Equation (54) was solved numerically. Integration of\nthe result over the unit interval provided the free induction decay of the overall magnetization, and application\nof Eq. (5) on the result gave the spin echo decay. When\nthe spin echo relaxation time was defined as the first statistical moment of the magnetization decay Eq. (30) was\napplied. For determination of T2\u2217 , defined as the first\nmoment of the free induction decay, Eq. (56) was solved\nR 1/2\nnumerically, and integration \u22121/2 dx m\u0302(x, s) = M\u0302 (s)\ngave T2\u2217 = M\u0302 (0) = \u03bc\u22121 (M ).\n\n8\n\n\fh1|\u00db0 (s)|1i = \u22122\u0002 arctan(2s)\u2212\ni cosh(2\u03c0s)Ci(\u03be)+\n\u0003\nsinh(2\u03c0s)Si(\u03be)\n\n2. ESC approximation\n\nThe determination of the ESC0 and ESC1 approximation is completely analogous to that for the Anderson Weiss model, except that the \u03a9-polynomial and the\neigenfunction base are not identical.\nESC0 approximation The equilibrium function for\nthe restricted diffusion within the unit interval is\n|0i = 1\n\n(57)\n\nh0|\u00db0 (s)|0i = i ln\n\ns \u2212 i/2\ns + i/2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n\u03bb1 \u2248 9.89 \u03b2\n\u03bb \u2248 41.6 \u03b2\n\n(58)\n\n(59)\n\nInsertion of the results of Eqs.

The parameters\n\u03bb1 , \u03bb of the ESC1 approximation are determined from\nthe self consistency condition (20), i.e. with Eqs. (D4),\n(E11)and and Eqs. (D7),(E17) one obtains\n\u03bb1 = 10 \u03b2\n\u03bb=\n\n443520\n\u03b2\n8900\n\n\u2248 49.83 \u03b2\n\n(63)\n\n(64)\n\nRelaxation in the ESC0 and ESC1 approximation\nFigure 4 demonstrates the first long time moment of\nthe free induction decay, that of the strong collision\napproximation, and its first extension for both bases\nas a function of the diffusion coefficient \u03b2. All curves\nshow the same asymptotic behavior in the static dephasing (\u03b2 \u2192 0) and in the motional narrowing limit\n(\u03c41 h0|x2 |0i = 1/120 \u03b2 \u22121 \u226a 1). Furthermore the better approximation by the ESC1 curves compared to the\nESC0 curve in the intermediate motion regime is evident.\nThere is no significant difference between the ESC1 approximation in the eigenfunction and in the \u03a9-polynomial\nbase.\nThe spin echo magnetization decay is shown in Fig. 5.\nEspecially in the long time behavior near the static dephasing regime, the ESC1 curves either in the eigenfunction space or in the \u03a9-space demonstrate a better approximation than the ESC0 curve. This is also reflected\nby the dependence of spin echo relaxation rate 1/T2 on\nthe diffusion coefficient (Figs. 6,7). When defined by the\necho time (Eq. (29)) the ESC0 and ESC1 curves run parallel with the curve obtained for restricted the diffusion\ndynamics for short echo times. For longer echo times and\ndecreasing diffusion coefficients the ESC1 curve provides\na better approximation. Again as for the free induction\ndecay there is no significant difference between ESC1 approximations in the eigenfunction and that in the \u03a9-base.\n\nThe self consistency condition for the strong collision approximation (9) determines the parameter \u03bb as (s. appendix Eqs. (C2) (E11))\n\u03bb = 10 \u03b2\n\n\u03be=\u22122z \u2217\n\nwhere Ci and Si denote the integral cosine and integral\nsinus function respectively. The parameters \u03bb1 \u03bb in the\neigenfunction base are determined similarly as in the \u03a9base (s. appendix) and one obtains\n\ni.e. one obtains\n\u0012\n\n\u03be=2z\n\n(61)\nV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nDevelopment in the eigenfunction space: The normalized non equilibrium eigenfunctions of the restricted diffusion operator are\n\u221a\n|\u03bdi = \u221a2 sin(\u03bd\u03c0 x) for \u03bd = 1, 3, ...\n= 2 cos(\u03bd\u03c0 x) for \u03bd = 2, 4, ... .\n(62)\n\nAnalytical results on transverse spin relaxation due\nto stochastic phase modulation exist mainly for limiting\ncases, like the motional narrowing and the static regime.\nPerturbation approaches are only valid close to their respective limits, and they diverge as one tries to extend\nthem towards the opposite motion regime. Particularly\nthe intermediate motion regime cannot be described reliably by such a treatment.\nWe choose a different approach. Our aim was to approximate the dynamics, assumed to be Markovian, by\na more simple one that conserves specific features of the\n\nSince [\u2202x2 ] is a symmetric operator left and right sided\neigenfunctions are identical. With |f1 i = |1i and z =\n\u03c0(1/2 + i s) one obtains\n\u221a \u0002\nh0|\u00db0 (s)|1i = 2 sinh(\u03c0s)Ci(\u03be)+\n\u0003 \u03be=z\ni cosh(\u03c0s)Si(\u03be)\n\u2217\n\u03be=\u2212z\n\n9\n\n\f|f1 i, hf1 |f1 i = 1. Equation (65) implies that in the motional narrowing limit the long time behavior of spin dephasing solely depends on the free propagator related relaxation of the state |f1 i, i.e. this state remains the only\nrelevant one. Hence, it is obvious that in the intermediate motion regime an ESC1 approximation including\nthe state |f1 i in its generator is superior to the ESC0\napproximation.\nWithin the function base the propagator of spin dephasing is directly related to the propagator of spin dephasing in the absence of stochastic phase modulations.\nThis specific feature of the ESC dynamics tremendously\nfacilitates the actual determination of spin dephasing for\nthe following reasons: (i) in many cases the propagator\nin the static motion regime (which is an average phase\nfactor) may be determined analytically or at least numerically; (ii) the determination of the propagator from\nthat in the static motion regime is self contained within\nthe base, i.e. it is obtained from a combination of finite\ndimensional matrices.\nThe two lowest order ESC approximations were applied to two generic models: spin dephasing in the Anderson Weiss model, i.e. Gaussian frequency distribution\nand Gaussian transition dynamics, and dephasing by restricted diffusion in a linear frequency gradient. The\nreason for this choice was that \u2013 besides their generic\ncharacter \u2013 these models allow either an analytical (Anderson Weiss) or, at least, a simple numerical treatment\n(linear gradient) of magnetization decay. These features\nare helpful to prove the ESC approach. For the Anderson Weiss model we determined the corresponding\nMarkov generator of the phase modulations, which \u2013 to\nour knowledge \u2013 was done here for the first time.\nFor both generic models the subsequent improvement\nby ESCn approximations of dephasing parameters and\nmagnetization decays could be demonstrated. One of our\nnext aims will be the application of the ESC approach to\nmore realistic scenarios.\nIn closing, we would like to emphasize that the ESC\napproach is actually not limited to spin dephasing only.\nIt can be applied, in principle, in any situation where the\ntime behavior of complicated observables of stochastic\nprocesses is of interest. In each case, however, an appropriate function base has to be chosen, corresponding to\nthe \u03a9-base for spin dephasing.\n\noriginal. The starting point was the strong collision approximation [4] that assumes the transition probability\nbetween two states being independent from the initial\nstate, an approximation that holds when spin dephasing occurs on a time scale significantly longer than the\nstochastic phase modulations. Hence, all states perpendicular to the equilibrium state relax with the same exponential factor that is determined self-consistently by\ncomparison with the field fluctuations.\nNote that the motional narrowing limit as well as the\nstatic dephasing regime are described correctly by this\napproximation. Consequently, the error in the intermediate motion regime is already less than it would be by\nperturbation approaches of a comparable low order. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement. Also, one\nwould like to have higher order approximations that can\nbe used to check the quality of low order descriptions.\nA systematic extension of the strong collision ansatz is\nto include the relaxation of states of an appropriate finite function base explicitly. We require that correlation\ntimes of original and approximate dynamics are identical\nto a certain order. This self consistency condition assures\nthat both dynamics have the same motional narrowing\nexpansion of spin dephasing. As it was already in the\nstrong collision ansatz, spin dephasing is asymptotically\nidentical for both dynamics in the limit of the static motion regime.\nThe finite function base of the ESCn approximation\nmay be given by the first n ordered eigenfunctions of the\ngenerator of the original phase modulations. Obviously,\nthen the ESC generator directly reflects the dynamics of\noriginal generator up to a time scale corresponding to\nthe n-th eigenvalue. For practical applications the ESC\napproach within an eigenfunction space may be a safe\nway to approximate spin dephasing. However, when the\ndetermination of the eigenfunctions is tedious, the application of the \u03a9-base [|0i, |f1 i \u223c \u03a9|0i, |f2 i \u223c \u03a92 |0i, . . .]\nmay be more appropriate, at least for the ESC1 approximation. Within the \u03a9-base the determination of the twoand four-point correlation times (s. appendix) and the\npropagator in the static motion regime, Eq. (52), is considerably simplified.\nThe mechanism by which the ESC1 approach in the \u03a9base works becomes evident by the following consideration: terms of the motional narrowing expansion Eq. (B1)\nmay be interpreted as repetitive interactions of the spin\nsystem with the inhomogeneous field \u03a9 and intermediate evolution with the free propagator exp(Rti ). In the\nmotional narrowing limit, one obtains from Eq.
