Although there have been a number of reviews on the spectroscopy of particles embedded in or attached to helium\nnano-droplets [1\u20137], none of these articles covers the recent advances made in the study of open shell, free radical metastable species. Therefore, an overview of this\nemerging field and the new possibilities it provides for the\nunderstanding of chemical reaction dynamics is timely.\nRadicals and molecular ions are among the most chemically reactive species known and play a key role in chemistry ranging from combustion processes [8] to the upper\natmosphere [9] and molecular synthesis in the interstellar\nmedium [10]. This high reactivity comes at a considerable cost to experimentalists; such transient species are\noften very difficult to maintain at sufficient concentrations to be probed experimentally. While a great deal\nof progress has been made by isolating radicals in vacuum, much less is known about the interactions of radicals, or more generally, the features of their potential\nenergy surfaces (PES). A focal point in chemical reaction dynamics has been to elucidate the properties of the\ntransition state, the point on the PES where bonds are\nbroken and reformed. Already in 1884 van't Hoff proposed [11], and five years later Arrhenius provided an\nphysical interpretation [12], for an empirical, analytical\nexpression for the rate constant of a reaction, relating it\nto an energy penalty needed to produce an activated complex, which could then go on to produce the products. A\nquantum-mechanical interpretation of the activation process was first given by London [13] and successively by\nEyring and Polyani [14], who introduced the concepts\nof a reaction path and the transition state as a saddlepoint on a multi-dimensional PES (Sattelgebiet des Res\"\nonanzgebirges\") for the H+H2 , H+HBr, and H+Br2 reaction systems.[245] Later, the efficiency of a reaction\ncould be predicted based on the initial reagent energy\n(whether it be translational or vibrational) by developing the concept of early or late potential barriers [15, 16].\nRecent advances in reactive scattering have now enabled\nfully (initial and final) quantum state resolved reaction\ncrosssections to be determined for a few prototype systems, like F+H2 [17\u201320], which was once considered to be\nthe holy grail of the field. The matrix of initial and final\nquantum states provides a rigorous test of theoretical potential energy surfaces. One should note, however, that\neven at the full state to state level, impact parameter averaging acts to convolute the experimental results, sometimes making it difficult to draw quantitative conclusions\non the detailed features of the potential. Furthermore,\n\nthe scalability of such experiments to larger and larger\nsystems is prohibitive. Oriented collisions [21\u201324], and\nespecially the application of state-selected, decelerated\nmolecular beams [25\u201329] and their use in scattering experiments [30] are likely to be important tools enabling\nthe experimentalist to further reduce the effects of impact\nparameter averaging.\nWhile reactive scattering is a sensitive probe of the repulsive wall of the PES, much less is known about the\nlong-range dispersive forces between reactive species. Indeed, already Eyring and Polyani [14] discussed the additional effects of dispersion forces on the PES, which\npredicted a minimum for the symmetric H3 molecule on\ntheir collinear PES. For the heavier systems they concluded that their calculations were not accurate enough\nto incorporate these effects quantitatively. However, the\nvan der Waals minima which result from the balance of\nattractive and repulsive forces lie at the base of the transition state, and correspond to weakly bound clusters of\ntwo (or more) reactants or products. These species are\nlabeled as entrance or exit channel complexes, respectively. Given that the barriers to chemical reaction are\ntypically several orders of magnitude larger than dispersion (van der Waals) forces, the importance of these van\nder Waals forces to reaction dynamics has largely been\nneglected. Recent experimental and theoretical work on\nthe Cl + HD \u2192 HCl (DCl) + H (D) reaction, however, has\nshown that the corresponding orientational effects of the\nlong range potential can strongly influence the branching\nratios and the final state distributions by giving the reactants a torque, towards or away from the transition state\n[31\u201335]. Therefore, the long-range van der Waals forces\ncan no longer be neglected for obtaining really quantitative results. For collisions at even lower temperature [30]\nsuch effects will be even more important. Moreover, also\nfor the dissociation of formaldehyde [36, 37] and the hydrogen abstraction from hydrocarbon molecules by chlorine [38] the effects of long-range van der Waals interactions have clearly been observed. Therefore, it must be\nconcluded, that a quantitative understanding of van der\nWaals wells of molecular complexes is imperative.\nOne of the legacies that Roger E. Miller has left with\nus is the sensitivity of high resolution spectroscopy of\nsuch weakly bound complexes as a probe of the surrounding PES. Here again, theory plays a crucial role in solving the multidimensional problem standing between the\nPES and the observed spectral transitions between eigenstates of the exact Hamiltonian. More recently, these\nspectroscopic techniques have been applied to reactive\nsystems, where now the experimental methods have the\nadded challenge of stabilizing the weakly bound complex and preventing the reaction. Sometimes the cooling\nprovided by a free jet expansion is sufficient to stabilize such pre-reactive species, which can then be studied\nspectroscopically. The most common examples are XHY radicals, where X are, for example, H2 or noble gas\natoms and Y=C, O, N, S, B, or CN radicals. Many of\n\n\f4\nthe previous experiments have been performed using an\nnoble-gas atom such as argon or neon to study the effects of polarization, and in these cases no reaction can\noccur [39, 40]. Complexes have also been observed between reactive partners such as, for example, OH+CO\n[41], OH+H2 [42\u201346], and CN+H2 [47\u201350]. However,\nin these systems the barriers to reaction are still quite\nlarge. So far these experimental techniques have relied\non the exquisite sensitivity of laser induced fluorescence\ndouble-resonance methods in order to measure the spectra, somewhat limiting the choice of chromophores.\nMany transient radicals have also been studied in solid\nnoble-gas matrices [51\u201353]. Indeed, the inert matrix\ncan be used to keep the radicals from interacting with\none another, and in general the number of radicals can\nbe built up using long deposition times. One can also\nraise the temperature of the solid matrix, which gives\nthe dopants some mobility, eventually initiating the reactions. Due to the large matrix effects, however, the\nspectra are often strongly perturbed, thus limiting the\namount of information which can be extracted. Indeed,\nthe highly anisotropic interaction is found to quench the\nfree rotation of most molecules. In contrast to the more\nclassical cryogenic matrices described above, cold, solid\npara-hydrogen matrices have also recently been used to\nstudy molecules in a more soft, quantum mechanical matrix [54\u201356], but even this special matrix does not give\nsuch great control over the growth process as liquid helium droplets. Reactions of embedded impurities with\nH2 , the matrix material itself, can easily be studied, but\nfor other purposes the matrix is not as inert as noble-gas\nenvironments [57].\nLiquid helium nano-droplets combine the advantages of\nboth types of solid matrix environments. They are inert due to the very noble, unreactive character of the\nhelium atoms constituting the matrix and they perturb embedded impurities only very weakly due to their\nquantum-fluid nature, which manifests itself in the superfluidity of the droplets [58]. The droplets provide a\nvery low ambient temperature of approximately 0.37 K,\ndue to evaporative cooling and the low binding energy\nof helium atoms to the droplet. Molecules embedded\nin 4 He droplets show free rotation [59]. The formation of weakly bound molecular complexes inside helium\nnano-droplets proceeds through unique growth dynamics which are mainly determined by long-range forces\nbetween the complexation partners [1]. Therefore, often metastable clusters are stabilized and can be studied in the droplets [60, 61]. Additional information on\nthe PES can be obtained using infrared-infrared doubleresonance spectroscopy, where the photo-initiated annealing of complexes provides branching ratios between\ndifferent minima and limits on the barrier heights and allows to observe the products of photo-initiated chemical\nreactions [62, 63].\nExtending such studies to transient, reactive species can\nprovide novel materials, that can be studied using high-\n\nresolution spectroscopy. It should be possible, for example, to build linear chains from polar OH radicals just\nlike in the case of HCN molecules [60], or similar highly\nreactive systems. Such systems are ideal candidates for\nchemical energy storage and provide large energy-to-mass\nratios. The details of such prospective experiments are\ndiscussed in section VI A. Moreover, the spectroscopic\nstudy of such highly energetic systems provides complementary information to scattering experiments on chemical reaction dynamics.\nIn this review we will detail the experimental methods\nfor embedding and studying radicals embedded in superfluid helium nano-droplets. In the following section a\ngeneral introduction into helium droplet experiments is\ngiven, followed by the details of radical production. Then\nwe will describe the experiments on radical monomers\n(section III) and on radical-molecule van der Waals complexes in section IV. Afterward, a discussion of moleculedroplet interactions, emphasizing the additional information from spectroscopy of open-shell systems embedded\nin helium droplets (section V), and an outlook for further\napplications (section VI) are given.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODS\n\nSpectroscopy in superfluid helium nano-droplets\n\nThe experimental details concerning the production of\nneat and doped helium droplets have been given in previous reviews [1\u20136] and their thermodynamic properties\nhave been discussed [64\u201366]. Therefore, here we will only\ndiscuss the relevant details and specialties for embedding radicals in the droplets. A schematic of the first\napparatus for infrared spectroscopy of radicals embedded in helium droplets [67], built at the University of\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), is shown in Figure 1. In brief, the setup consists of a continuous helium\ndroplet beam source and several, differentially pumped\nvacuum chambers. The source chamber contains the supersonic droplet beam source. The droplet beam passes\nthrough a skimmer into a region with a series of load\n\nFigure 1: Experimental setup for the infrared spectroscopy of\nradicals in superfluid helium droplets; see text for details.\n\n\f5\nlock ports to introduce pick-up sources of varying nature.\nAfter the droplets are doped they fly into a laser excitation region, where a multipass cell, consisting of two\nplane, parallel gold-coated mirrors, is used to increase\nthe laser-droplet beam interaction. This spectroscopy\nregion also has a pair of parallel electrodes, providing\nhomogeneous fields up to 80 kV/cm, in which Stark and\npendular spectroscopy [68] can be performed. In all experiments reported here, the electric field is parallel to\nthe laser-polarization, yielding \u2206m = 0 selection rules\nfor the associated Stark and pendular spectra. The overall kinetic energy of the beam is then detected further\ndownstream by a cooled semiconductor bolometer detector [1]. Alternatively, mass-spectrometric detection has\nbeen used in similar ways [1, 2], however, in that case\nthe infrared laser beam is typically sent collinear to the\ndroplet beam to achieve sufficient signal to noise ratios.\nDroplets are typically produced by expanding highpressure helium (20\u2013100 bar) through a small, cooled\npinhole (5\u201310 \u03bcm, 5\u201330 K), as originally demonstrated\nby Becker et al. in 1961 [69]. Droplets are formed in the\nearly, high-pressure portion of the expansion and then\nsuccessively cooled by evaporation. In the case of 4 He,\nas used in all spectroscopic studies on radicals embedded\nin helium droplets so far, the evaporation temperature\nconverges at \u223c 0.37 K [64] and 4 He droplets exhibit superfluidity under these conditions [58].\nAtomic and molecular impurities are embedded in the\ndroplets by pick-up in scattering regions [1, 2]. The pickup process is sequential, that is, individual atoms and\nmolecules are picked up from the scattering gas, where\nonly low densities are necessary, because the pick-up\nprobability is determined by the large, geometrical crosssections of the droplets. The cooling of dopants inside the\nhelium droplet occurs on a timescale considerable faster\nthan the complexation of multiple embedded species. For\n(HCN)n complexes embedded in a single droplet, for example, about 1000 cm\u22121 binding energy are released\nupon addition of an additional HCN molecule. If that\nenergy would be deposited in the molecular complex, the\ncluster would anneal to its global minimum structure.\nHowever, the helium removes the energy quickly as the\ncomplex is forming, forcing it to stay at the zero-point\nlevel while traversing the PES. Therefore, the complexes\nare often trapped in local minima and metastable species\ncan be observed [60, 61]. Moreover, since the pick-up\ncan be performed in multiple separate scattering regions,\nconsiderable control over the formation of larger clusters can be achieved, as, for example, shown for HF-Arn\ncomplexes [70]. This separable pick-up also allows to produce clusters with quite complex compositions, possibly\ncontaining multiple species, and to embed species under\nquite different conditions into the droplet. For example, thermally labile bio-molecules and metal atoms from\na hot oven or radicals from an 1800 K pyrolysis source\ncan be embedded in the same droplet, because the two\nspecies only come together in the cold confines of the\n\ndroplet. This unique production process allows to specifically design desired complexes inside helium droplets.\nAll molecular radicals or radical-molecule complexes embedded in a helium droplet that have been studied using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy so far have either been stable molecules, like NO, that were picked up in an ordinary\nscattering chamber, or were produced in a continuous effusive pyrolysis source developed some years ago [67]; see\nsection II B for details.\nDifferent detection schemes used in helium droplet spectroscopy have been described before [1, 2]. In all studies described in detail in this review, infrared depletion\nspectroscopy is used, where the evaporation of helium\natoms from the droplet due to resonant infrared excitation of the dopant is detected [1]. In most of the studies reported here the reduced total kinetic energy of the\ndroplet beam on a 1.1 K bolometer is measured using\nlock-in techniques, but mass spectrometric techniques,\nalbeit less sensitive, have also been employed [1], also\nfor performing electronic spectroscopy of doped helium\ndroplets [2, 7]. However, the bolometer detection proved\nto be the most sensitive so far. It is very general as it detects directly the evaporation of helium atoms from the\ndroplet and does not require any specialized UV laser\nsystems. Due to its quasi-continuous operation mode it\nmatches the continuous droplet beams very well and provides optimal experimental duty cycle.\nIn the interpretation of rotationally resolved spectra of\nspecies embedded in helium droplets the matrix effects\nof the droplet environment needs to be considered. Vibrational frequencies of the embedded molecules are typically shifted very little from their gas-phase values, and\ndue to the superfluidity of the droplets, free rotation of\nthe embedded species can be observed [59]. The obtained\nrotational constants, however, are reduced from their corresponding gas-phase values [1, 59] and the influence of\nthe droplet environment on the electronic structure can\nalso be considerable. These effects are discussed in section V.\n\nB.\n\nRadical production\n\nSome molecular radicals are not transient at all and\ncan be bought and stored under ambient conditions.\nTherefore a simple pick-up cell can be used to embed\nthese species in the droplets. NO is an example of\nsuch a molecule that has also been studied in helium\ndroplets [71].\nFor transient species, however, one has to resort to in situ\nproduction of the radical in the experiment. Several different methods for producing radicals for molecular beam\nstudies have been developed, including pyrolysis, radiofrequency or microwave discharges, corona discharges,\nand photolysis [72, 73]. The most popular sources for\n\n\f6\nuse in combination with the extreme cooling provided\nin supersonic jet experiments are flash pyrolysis [74\u201376],\nelectric discharge sources [77\u201379], and photolysis sources\n[80\u201382].\nThese methods are, however, not currently generally applicable for embedding molecules into helium droplets,\nas they are mostly operated in a pulsed fashion and require relatively high gas-pressures. While these radical\nsources are efficient in producing a large number of radicals, especially the discharge and photolysis sources often\nproduce a large number of by-products. For gas-phase\nstudies this does not necessarily represent a problem as\nlong as the background pressure is kept low enough to\nprevent collisions, and that the target-radical concentration is high enough for the experimental sensitivity.\nAlso, if a precursor or decomposition product absorbs\nin the same spectral region as the species of interest,\nthen it may be difficult to separate out the overlapping\nbands. In a helium droplet experiment, however, all\nspecies are picked up by the droplets without any discrimination. Therefore, extremely clean sources of radicals are required for these experiments in order not to\ncontaminate all droplets. This includes buffer gas, which\nmakes up most of the gas-phase expansion. Moreover,\nmost helium droplet experiments today are operated as\ncontinuous beams and are therefore most efficiently used\nwith continuous doping methods. Coupling pulsed radical sources to these beams, especially photolysis sources\nusing intense pulsed lasers operating at 10 Hz, leads to\nlarge reductions of duty cycle and correspondingly lower\nsignals. Once pulsed helium droplet sources are wider\napplicable [83, 84], however, they may make such radical\nsources more compatible.[246]\n\nPyrolysis\n\nThe ideas from flash pyrolysis, even if not directly applicable, can be transferred to conditions suitable for embedding radicals in helium droplets [67]. A scheme of the\nlow-pressure, continuous, effusive pyrolysis source used at\nUNC is shown in Figure 2. The source can routinely be\nheated to 1800 K to produce clean effusive beams of radicals from appropriate precursor molecules. Due to the\noptical transparency of liquid helium over an extremely\nwide energy range (up to 21 eV), black-body radiation\nfrom the hot source does not effect the droplet beam.\n\nOther schemes\n\nWhile our approach has been to generate the radicals\nexternally and dope them into the droplets, another approach would be to produce radicals from photolysis\nof a stable molecule already embedded inside a helium\n\nFigure 2: A schematic diagram of a pyrolysis source that\ncan be load-locked into the helium nano-droplet apparatus,\nto facilitate the easy change of pick-up sources. In this case,\nan alumina tube is heated by a tantalum filament. A needle\nvalue is used to regulate the flow of the precursor through the\nsource.\n\ndroplet. Near threshold photo-dissociation of NO2 has\nbeen attempted by Conjusteau et al. [85], with the goal of\nobserving the NO-O radical-radical van der Waals complex, but this has not been successful. It is unclear\nwhether the helium is able to quench the energy faster\nthan the time necessary to break the molecule apart, or\nthe two fragments always react to give back NO2 . Braun\nand Drabbels [86] have used 266 nm photodissociation\nof CF3 I and CH3 I embedded in helium droplets to study\nthe translational dynamics of the recoiling CH3 (CF3 )\nand I atom fragments. Here, 266 nm photolysis promotes\nthe CH3 I to a highly repulsive electronic state, which is\nknown to dissociate very rapidly in the gas-phase [87].\nIn the helium droplet study gas-phase fragments ejected\nfrom the droplets were detected by velocity map imaging [88] and their product distributions were found to be\nless anisotropic and shifted to lower velocities than compared to the equivalent gas-phase experiment [86], consistent with a model of hard sphere collisions. Since the\ndetection method was based on imaging the gas-phase\nrecoil products, studies were carried out using relatively\nsmall droplets, which allowed the fragments to escape.\nPhotolyzing the embedding precursor in a much larger\ndroplet, however, could allow one or both of the products to stay within the droplet.\nCold ion-molecule reactions have also been observed in\nhelium droplets [89]. In this study 80 eV kinetic energy\nelectrons were used to bombard the helium droplets, resulting in ionization of a single He atom in the droplet.\nThe molecular impurity may then be ionized after resonant charge transfer [90]. Although the newly formed\nmolecular ions are ejected from the droplet due to the\nenergy released in the charge transfer step, ion-molecule\nreactions between these secondary molecular ions and ad-\n\n\f7\nditional molecules embedded in the droplet could be observed, yielding, for example N2 D+ (from N+\n2 and D2 ),\n+\n+\nCH4 D+ , or CH3 D+\n2 (from CH4 or CH3 and D2 ) [89].\n\nIII.\n\nRADICAL MONOMERS IN HELIUM\nDROPLETS\nA.\n\nPropargyl\n\nThe first spectroscopic study of a molecular radical in helium droplets was performed on propargyl (2-propynyl,\nC3 H3 ) just five years ago [67]. In light of its role in sooting flames, the propargyl radical has been the focus of\nparticular experimental attention [91\u201394]. Propargyl is\none of the simplest conjugated systems with an odd number of electrons, also making it the focus of considerable\ntheoretical study [95\u201398]. There is compelling evidence\nthat propargyl is the most important radical precursor\nin the formation of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and soot in certain combustion processes [91\u2013\n94, 99\u2013104]. For example, the simple dimerization of two\npropargyl radicals is thought to be important in the formation of benzene, as suggested by Wu and Kern [99].\nThe work on the transient and very reactive propargyl\nradical embedded in helium droplets demonstrated how\nto couple our continuous, low-pressure pyrolysis source\nto a helium droplet beam for pick-up of such transient\nspecies [67]. From a fit to the rotationally resolved infrared spectrum of the \u03bd1 -transition the molecular parameters given in Table I are obtained. We find that the\nKa = 1 states are populated due to nuclear spin statistics, confirming the C2v symmetry of this radical. This\nshows, moreover, that the local environment inside the\nhelium droplet does not lower the symmetry. Indeed,\nnuclear spin conversion processes are extremely slow in\nthe gas-phase [108], but even the presence of the unpaired electron and the collision rich condensed phase\nenvironment inside the droplet does not induce any noticeable spin relaxation on the timescale of the experiment (\u223c 1 ms), demonstrating the weak perturbation\nof the embedded radical by the helium droplet environment. Nuclear spin relaxation was observed in quantumsolid para-hydrogen matrices on a much longer timescale\nof minutes to hours [109] and the accelerating effect of\nadded ortho-hydrogen was clearly observed. Since the\nensemble of complexes studied in a helium droplet experiment is only from droplets with exactly the wanted\ncomposition and the helium\u2013complex interaction is generally weaker then the solid-hydrogen\u2013molecule interaction, one would expect the conversion even to be considerably slower in helium droplets.\nWhile the A rotational constants cannot be determined\nfrom the experimental data, the (B + C)/2 inertial parameters for ground and excited vibrational state were\n\nconstant\nhelium dropleta\ngas-phaseb\n\u2032\u2032\n\u22121\nc\nA (cm )\n9.60847\n9.60847 (18)\n(B \u2032\u2032 + C \u2032\u2032 )/2 (cm\u22121 )\n0.1198 (5)\n0.312386 (12)\nB \u2032\u2032 \u2212 C \u2032\u2032 (cm\u22121 )\n0.035 (2)\n0.0105762 (35)\n\u2206\u2032\u2032N (cm\u22121 )\n0.00042 (1)\n7.35 (122) * 10\u22128\nA\u2032 (cm\u22121 )\n9.60258c\n9.60258 (11)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22121\n(B + C )/2 (cm )\n0.1185 (5)\n0.311641 (7)\nB \u2032 \u2212 C \u2032 (cm\u22121 )\n0.035 (2)\n0.010496 (13)\n\u2206\u2032N (cm\u22121 )\n0.00062 (1)\n5.37 (76) * 10\u22128\n\u03bd0 (cm\u22121 )\n3322.15 (1)\n3322.292 (10)\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03bca (D)\n-0.150 (5)\n-\n\u2206\u03bca (D)\n0.02 (1)\n-\na Reported helium droplet values are from reference 67.

Numbers in\nparenthesis are one standard deviation.\n\nabout one third of the gas-phase values, a reduction that\nis typical for rotational constants of this size [1]. The\nasymmetry-splittings B \u2212 C are increased in the helium\ndroplet environment, probably due to differential effects\nof the helium droplet environment on the rotation around\nthe different axes.\nThis study was the first to experimentally determine\nthe permanent dipole moment of propargyl radical by\nmeasuring the rotationally resolved infrared spectrum\nin the presence of a strong homogeneous electric field\n(50 kV cm\u22121 ). It is known that dipole moments determined by Stark spectroscopy in helium droplets are very\ncomparable to the gas-phase values [110]. This is confirmed by the good agreement of the measured values\nfor propargyl (\u03bc0 = \u22120.150(5) D and the \u2206\u03bcv=1\u21900 =\n0.02(1) D) and calculated values (\u03bce = \u22120.14(3) D,\n\u03bc0 = \u22120.124 D, \u03bcv=1\u21900 = 0.011 D) [96, 111].\n\nB.\n\nNitric oxide\n\nRecently, the nitric oxide (NO) radical was studied using\ninfrared diode laser spectroscopy in helium droplets [71].\nOnly the Q(1/2) and R(1/2) transitions of the v = 1 \u2190 0\ntransition in the 2 \u03a01/2 electronic ground state were observed due to the low temperature (0.4 K) of the droplet\nand the small moment of inertia of NO. From the line separation the rotational constant of NO in helium droplets\nis measured to be B = 1.253 cm\u22121 , which is 76 % of the\ngas-phase value, in good agreement with previous closed\nshell systems of this size.\n\n\f8\nFor the Q(1/2) line sharp transitions are obtained. This\nreflects the fact that vibrational relaxation is slow due\nthe absence of low-lying vibrational modes [112, and references therein]. Indeed, previous studies of HF embedded in helium droplets have shown that the monomer\ndoes not vibrationally relax at all on the timescale of the\nexperiment (\u223c 1 ms) [113], so instead of depleting the\ndroplet beam intensity, the extra vibrational energy of\nHF is simply carried to the bolometer. Using a massspectrometer based detection scheme, such as that used\nin the study of NO, one would not a priori expect a depletion signal in this case. Molecular absorption beam\ndepletion can still be detected, however, due to pickup of an impurity, i. e. a second NO or N2 , after the\ninfrared excitation, leading to relaxation of the vibrationally excited molecular dimer, as shown conclusively\nfor HF [112]. The resulting long monomer lifetime allows\nthe nuclear hyperfine and \u039b-doubling splittings of the\ntransition to be resolved. The nuclear hyperfine splitting\nis unchanged from the isolated gas-phase value, whereas\nthe \u039b-doubling is increased by a factor of 1.55 compared\nto the gas-phase [71]. The authors discuss this effect in\nterms of electronic coupling and also suggest the possible\ninfluence of the helium density around the NO molecular\naxis [71]. For more details of these effects see the results\non the NO-HF complex in section IV C and the general\ndiscussion of molecule-droplet interactions in section V.\nThe R(1/2) line, on the other hand, shows a single unresolved band that fits well to a Lorentzian lineshape,\nwhich is attributed to fast rotational relaxation in the vibrationally excited state with a lifetime of 1.52 * 10\u221210 s.\nThe large rotational constant of NO places the excited\nrotational state in a region of high density of states for\nthe fundamental excitations of the droplet, leading to a\nstrong coupling and the corresponding short lifetime [1].\nThe NO molecule was also used as a sensitive probe of\nelectronic effects of molecule-droplet interactions [114].\nIn that study, NO embedded in liquid helium droplets\nwas photoionized and the ongoing dynamics was found to\nbe quite complex. NO is initially excited by a two-photon\nexcitation from its 2 \u03a0 electronic ground state to lowlying Rydberg states (NO\u2217 ). Subsequently, the nuclear\ndegrees of freedom in NO\u2217 and between the NO\u2217 and\nthe helium environment relax and NO\u2217 is transported to\nthe droplet surface on a time-scale shorter than the laser\npulse (< 10 ns), where it can then leave the droplet along\nwith a modest number of helium atoms or, alternatively,\nbe photoionized. The formed ion can then be resolvated\nby snowball formation around the ion-core or leave the\ndroplet surrounded by helium atoms.\n\nC.\n\nOther species\n\nSeveral other radicals or transient species have been observed in or on liquid helium droplets. For example\n\nthe spectra of individual open shell metal atoms on helium droplets have been obtained [4, 7, 115\u2013117] and the\nchemiluminescence emission spectrum of the BaO\u2217 product from the reaction Ba + N2 O \u2192 BaO\u2217 + N2 inside a\nhelium droplet has been observed [118]. The reaction was\nfound to proceed very efficiently inside the droplet, and\nthe influence of co-embedded xenon clusters was studied, which showed that the xenon pulls the nascent BaO,\ninitially formed at the surface, into the center of the\ndroplet. Experiments on the photodissociation of CF3 I\nto form CF3 and I inside the helium droplets [86] and\non ion-molecule reactions [89] were already discussed in\nsection II B.\n\nIV.\n\nRADICAL-CONTAINING MOLECULAR\nCOMPLEXES\n\nWhereas the effects of the moderately strong long-range\nelectrostatic interactions in ion-molecule reactions are\nwell known to have a significant influence on the associated reaction rates [119, 120], the importance of the\nweaker van der Waals forces in the entrance channels of\nneutral reactions have been only recently fully appreciated [38, 41, 121, 122]. Experimental and theoretical\nwork on the Cl + HD \u2192 HCl (DCl) + D (H) reaction\nshows that the torque experienced by the HD in the entrance valley of the potential has a significant effect on\nthe overall reaction rates and branching ratios [31\u201334].\nFurthermore, the rotational excitation of HCl products\nformed from abstraction reactions of chlorine and organic\nmolecules, for example, can only be accurately described\nby taking into account the features of the exit channel.\nThe dipole-dipole interaction of the departing fragments\nwas found to be very important in determining the product final state distributions [38]. For the dissociation\nof formaldehyde a completely new dissociation mechanism (roaming hydrogen atom mechanism) has been proposed [36, 37]. These results are clear examples, that entrance and exit channel complexes of molecular reactions\nprobe the associated PES at energies that are relevant\nto the systems' chemical reaction dynamics, despite being much lower in energy than the corresponding transition states. However, the torque on the reactants at long\nrange acts to deflect trajectories towards or away from\nthe transition state [33]. Therefore, these complexes are\nof considerable importance in understanding the nature\nof the reactions, particularly at low translational energies\n(low temperatures).\nThe isolation and stabilization of entrance and exit channel complexes in liquid helium droplets and their highresolution spectroscopic study provides a novel experimental approach for studying these important systems.\nIn the remainder of this section we will summarize the\nexperiments performed on such complexes in liquid helium droplets to date. In the first part we will discuss the\nhydrogen-bound complexes of halogen atoms with small\n\n\f9\nlinear molecules and in the second part of this section we\nwill proceed to complexes of hydrocarbon radicals with\nhydrogen acids.\n\nA.\n\nComplexes containing halogen atoms\n\nRecently, a large series of complexes of closed shell\nmolecules with halogen atoms embedded in liquid helium\ndroplets have been studied using high-resolution infrared\nspectroscopy, i. e. the complexes of chlorine, bromine, and\niodine with HF and HCN, respectively [123, 124]. These\nsystems represent the prototypical heavy-light-heavy X\u2013\nHY (X=Cl, Br, I; Y=F, CN) complexes which serve as\nprominent benchmark systems for the understanding of\nelementary reaction dynamic studies. They can be studied in great detail theoretically [125\u2013138], as they contain\nonly two heavy atoms (X-HF) and only a few nuclear degrees of freedom. Some stationary points of such systems\nhave also been studied experimentally, for example, by\nspectroscopy of the transition states [134, 139\u2013141] and\nusing infrared spectroscopy in noble-gas matrices [142\u2013\n144]. These studies, however, did not reveal detailed\ninformation on the associated entrance or exit channel\nregions of the reactions.\nThe X-HF [145\u2013150] and X-HCN [151\u2013153] PES have also\nbeen studied in collision experiments. Recently, strong\nrotational enhancement has been described for the F +\nHCl reaction [150, 154]. The chemiluminescence from\nHF produced in chemical lasers, i. e. from reactions of\nClF with hydrogen, has been observed [155]. However,\nso far no spectra of the stationary points on the PES\nhave been obtained for the free molecular complexes.\nFor these X-HY systems, the interaction of the\nquadrupole moment of the halogen atom with the dipole\nmoment of the molecule suggests two linear structures\nwith the atom sitting on either end of the linear molecule.\nHowever, T-shaped minima are also predicted due to\nthe considerable quadrupole moments of the molecules\n[125, 130, 131, 133, 138]. The weak interaction between a halogen atom and the molecules in a van der\nWaals complex suggests, that, to a first approximation,\nthe orbital angular momentum jA of the atom will be\nconserved in the complex. This interaction removes the\ndegeneracy of the 2 P atomic states, which in Cs symmetry gives rise to two states of A\u2032 and one state of A\u2032\u2032\nsymmetry. These correspond to the three relative orientations of the singly occupied orbital with respect to\nthe complexation partner, i. e. the unpaired electron being in the px , py , and pz orbital, respectively. Solving\nfor the eigenvalues of the electronic Schr\u00f6dinger equation under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation yields\nthe adiabatic PES. However, since these surfaces are coupled by non-adiabatic coupling terms originating from\nthe nuclear kinetic energy operator, it is often helpful to\nsolve for the bound states in a diabatic representation\n\n[133, 138]. The electronic anisotropy is further complicated due to electron spin, and spin-orbit coupling can\nalso have an important effect on shaping the PES. For\ncomparison we reproduce the lowest diabatic and adiabatic PES including spin-orbit coupling for the Cl-HCl,\nCl-HF, and Br-HCN complexes in Figure 3(A\u2013C), (D\u2013F),\nand (G), respectively. The results for Cl-HCl [132, 133]\nand Cl-HF [136, 137] have been published previously,\nwhile preliminary results for Br-HCN have been provided by A. van der Avoird. The general topology of\nthe Cl-HCl and Cl-HF surfaces are quite similar. However, the larger dipole of HF, compared to HCl, makes\nthe linear hydrogen bound minimum deeper for Cl-HF\nand the T-shaped minimum has almost completely disappeared in the lowest adiabatic surface. Indeed, for ClHF only the linear hydrogen bound isomer was observed\nexperimentally in helium droplets, suggesting that the\nT-shaped or linear HF-X isomers are not formed. Detailed comparisons of the experimental and theoretical\nresults for the X-HF systems have been given elsewhere\n[124, 131, 136, 137]. In contrast, the lowest adiabatic surface for the Br-HCN system shows two deep minima corresponding to the hydrogen-bound and nitrogen-bound\nlinear isomers, respectively, which are also both observed\nexperimentally [123].\nThe 1 2 A\u2032 and 1 2 A\u2032\u2032 surfaces are degenerate at the linear H-bound configuration (\u03b8 = 0), whereas the 1 2 A\u2032\nand 2 2 A\u2032 surfaces are degenerate at the linear N-bound\nconfiguration (\u03b8 = 180). Therefore, the electronic symmetry is 2 \u03a3 for HCN-X, with the unpaired electron along\nthe axis of the molecule, and 2 \u03a0 for X-HCN, with the unpaired electron perpendicular to the axis of the molecule.\nIn Figure 4 survey scans for the Br-HCN systems with\ncold (room temperature) and heated (\u223c 1600 K) pyrolysis source are shown as an example. Such overview scans\nare infrared depletion spectra obtained in the presence\nof strong homogeneous electric fields (\u223c 60 kV cm\u22121 ) in\nwhich the complete rotational structure is collapsed into\na single pendular transition [68, 156, 157] due to the large\ndegree of orientation of the polar molecules in the cold\nenvironment.\nWhen the pyrolysis source is cold, only complexes of HCN\nwith halogen molecules are formed. When the pyrolysis\nnozzle is heated, however, the signals associated with the\nprecursor complexes are significantly reduced, due to the\ndissociation into atoms, and a new set of signals is observed to grow in, which are readily assigned to binary\ncomplexes of bromine atoms with HCN. Based on harmonic vibrational frequency calculations as well as physical intuition, the largely different frequency shifts of the\n\u03bdCH stretching vibrations result from the two different\nstructures of the complexes, namely the peak shifted furthest to the red corresponds to the Br-HCN complex, and\nthe peak which exhibits only a small shift is related to the\nHCN-Br complex. This assignment is confirmed by analysis of the field-free spectra of each of these transitions\n[123, 158].\n\n\f10\n\nFigure 3: (A, D) Diabatic potential energy surfaces for Cl-HCl and Cl-HF jA = 3/2 \u03c9 = 3/2 and (B, E) jA = 3/2 \u03c9 = 1/2,\nrespectively.

Jacobi coordinates as shown in the inset have been used throughout and \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 corresponds to the\nhydrogen bound arrangement. See text for details.\n\n\f11\n\nFigure 4: Pendular survey scans revealing the pyrolysis source\ntemperature dependence (upward peaks are with a hot source,\ndownward peaks are with a cold source) for the HCN +\nbromine experiment. The scans show peaks which we identify\nas molecular and atomic bromine complexed with HCN. The\npeak labeled with an asterisk is a known impurity.\n\nIn Figure 5 the field free spectrum of Br-HF is shown\nas an example. The vibrational frequency is shifted by\n131 cm\u22121 to lower energy compared to the HF monomer\ntransition [113], indicating the binding of Br to the hydrogen end of HF. The simulation of the rotationally resolved spectrum, constituted by all the individual simulated transitions shown at the bottom of the figure, reproduces all of the important features of the spectrum.\nSome deviations are observed especially for the lowestJ transitions, an effect that is regularly observed for\nmolecules embedded inside helium droplets; see section V\nfor details. The overall structure and all features are\nclearly reproduced by the simulation. Therefore, these\nspectra confirm the 2 \u03a03/2 ground states of these hydrogen bound complexes, consistent with the 2 P3/2 ground\nstate of atomic bromine. Spectra and simulations of the\nsame quality are obtained for all other hydrogen bound\nX-HF/HCN complexes studied. The molecular parameters obtained for the ground states for all complexes are\ngiven in Table II. In Figure 6 the field-free spectrum of\nthe nitrogen-bound HCN-Br complex is shown for a comparison and the molecular constants of all corresponding HCN-X complexes are also given in Table II. These\nnitrogen-bound complexes exhibit quite different features\nthan the hydrogen bound complexes. Whereas the \u03bdCH\nvibrational frequencies are shifted by tens of wavenumbers for the hydrogen bound complexes, these N-bound\ncomplexes are shifted only by a few cm\u22121 compared to\nthe free HCN molecule. The rotationally resolved spectra of the HCN-Br and HCN-I complexes also show a\nvery different fine-structure, which is assigned to paritysplitting due to the spin-orbit interaction between the\n2\n\u03a31/2 and the 2 \u03a01/2 states of the complex [123, 158].\nFor the HCN-Cl complex no such fine-structure could\nbe observed, what is consistent with the much smaller\nspin-orbit coupling constant of atomic chlorine than for\nbromine and iodine an the correspondingly small split-\n\nFigure 5: (A) The field-free infrared spectrum of Br-HF shown\ntogether with (B) a simulation that includes nuclear magnetic\nhyperfine interactions due to the bromine nucleus (I = 3/2).\nThe stick spectrum shows all of the transitions that underlie\nthe observed features.\n\ntings of the transitions that are not visible at the resolution of our experiment.\nIt had been proposed that Cl-HCl complexes may posses\nT-shaped structures, but display several of the properties of a linear open-shell molecule [133].

Nevertheless,\nthe fact that this point is subject of considerable debate\nillustrates how poorly we still understand these species,\ncalling out for more experiments and theory on these entrance channel complexes.\nNo complexes of atomic fluorine with HF or HCN have\nbeen observed, despite extensive searches for such complexes and a previous assignment for the \u03bdHF stretching\nvibrations of F-HF in argon matrices [144]. Moreover,\nfrom ab initio calculations it is clear, that the reaction\nof F + HCN to form HFCN via an insertion mechanism\nis quite exothermic and exhibits only a small barrier, if\nat all [123, 158]. The fact that the fluorine containing\nF-HCN complexes cannot be observed, could indeed be\nan indication that the insertion reaction takes place, even\nat 0.37 K. This reasoning is also supported by argon matrix work where the insertion product has been observed,\nwhereas no pre-reactive (van der Waals) complexes were\nfound [159, 160]. Guided by the experimental vibrational\nfrequency of 3018 cm\u22121 for HFCN in solid argon, we\nalso searched for the HFCN reaction product in the helium droplets. However, since this frequency is at the\nedge of the F-center laser tuning range and the transition strength is about 50 times weaker than for the HCN\nmonomer, no manifestations of the HFCN product could\nbe observed. Revisiting the experiment using newer technology OPO lasers [158, 161, 162], which have enhanced\ntuning ranges and improved power, might show the corresponding spectral signatures.\nSimilar studies to the ones described here have also been\nperformed on the pre-reactive complexes of open-shell\nmetal atoms (Al, Ga, In) [158] and semiconductor atoms\n(Ge) with HCN and preliminary results were presented\nin an earlier review [1]. Upon complex formation in liquid helium droplets the same linear van der Waals com-\n\nplexes as for the halogen atom HCN complexes are observed. However, these atom-HCN complexes can undergo an exothermic insertion reaction and the corresponding barriers are low enough that the reactions do\nactually proceed even at the low ambient temperatures\nof the helium droplet, depending on the metal, either directly or initiated by a single-quantum excitation of the\n\u03bdCH stretching vibration in the HCN moiety. Details on\nthe van der Waals complexes and the insertion products\nwill be published elsewhere [163]. Furthermore, the complexes of HCN with several alkaline (Na, K, Rb, Cs) and\nearth alkaline (Mg, Ca, Sr) atoms [164, 165], with Zn\natoms [166], and with Cu and Au atoms have been observed. The complexes of one to six magnesium atoms\nwith several small molecules have been studied extensively [167\u2013170]. Due to the electronic quasi-closed shell\nstructure of magnesium and high barriers to reaction in\nthese systems, these complexes exhibit the simple spectra\nof closed shell van der Waals complexes. For the heavier\natoms from these series it is known that the atom resides\non the surface of the droplet, forming a dimple [2, and\nreferences therein]. It is interesting to study the effects\nof embedding an atom that wants to stay on the surface\nof the droplet, and a molecule that wants to be inside the\ndroplet, which, in addition, strongly attract each other.\nFor Na-HCN, one of these systems, a very strong absorption line is observed [164, 165]. The remaining rotational\nstructure, however, is the spectrum of a linear or spherical top with a very much larger inertial moment than\nthat expected for a Na-HCN binary complex, even inside a helium droplet. The spectrum is actually consistent with the rotation of the Na-HCN mass around the\ndroplet and the observed rotational constant scales nicely\nwith the droplet radius. Therefore, it is concluded, that\nthe sodium pulls the HCN into a dimple on the surface\nof the droplet and the complex can freely rotate over the\nsurface of the helium droplet [164, 165]. However, no\n\n\f13\n\nFigure 7: (A) An experimental spectrum corresponding to\nthe HF stretching vibration of the CH3 -HF molecular complex, along with a symmetric top simulation (B) which clearly\nshows the C3v symmetry of this complex.

Scan (E)\nshows the corresponding spectrum for CD3 radicals, illustrating a dramatic increase in the lifetime of the complex and (F)\nthe corresponding simulation.\n\nrotational fine-structure can be observed due to the unresolved features in the extremely small B spectra.

The most simple fluorine + hydrocarbon system,\nF + CH4 \u2192 HF + CH3 , has been extensively studied\nboth experimentally [171] and theoretically [172], however, high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the entrance\nand exit channel regions of the PES are still lacking. Previous studies have identified the CH3 -HF complex in argon matrices [52, 173\u2013175].\nIn order to probe the exit channel region of the PES,\nmethyl radicals have been produced via pyrolysis, while\na second pick-up cell was used to dope the droplet with\nan HF molecule. Azomethane, di-tert-butyl peroxide\n(DTBP), and CH3 I were all used as precursors to confirm\nthat the signals genuinely arose from CH3 . In addition,\nseveral transitions of the CH3 monomer were also observed in helium. Figure 7 (A) shows a partially rotation-\n\nFigure 8: A plot of the corresponding energy levels of the CH3\nand CD3 monomers. The effect of deuteration in the CD3 HF complex is to lower the vibrational frequencies of the CH\nstretches, effectively quenching the vibration-vibration resonance that occurs with the excited HF stretching state of the\ncomplex. See text for details.\n\nally resolved experimental spectrum which is assigned\nto the HF stretching vibration of the CH3 -HF molecular complex. The C3v symmetry of the complex can\nbe uniquely identified from the large Q branch present\nin the spectrum. Indeed, at the temperature of the\ndroplets, we would not normally expect population of\nthe excited K states since the rotation about the a-axis\nonly moves the three hydrogen atoms, giving rise to a\nlarge energy spacing between different K states. Assuming nuclear spin conversion is slow compared with the\ntimescale of the experiment, the nuclear spin statistics of\nthe ro-vibrational wavefunction treat the K = 0, 3, 6 . . .\nand K = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 . . . states as separate identities of\nA and E symmetry, respectively, and thus they do not\ninterconvert upon cooling to 0.37 K. At the temperature of the droplets, all of the population is cooled into\nthe K = 0 and K = 1 states, and only for the K = 1\nstates \u2206J = 0 transitions are allowed. The intensities\nreflect the population of A : E states of CH3 in the hightemperature source, yielding a \u223c 1 : 1 population ration\nfor the K=0 and K=1 bands.\nThe linewidths in the CH3 -HF spectrum are rather\nbroad, somewhat limiting the accuracy of the molecular\nparameters determined by the fit to the spectrum, shown\nin Figure 7 (B)\u2013(D). Considering the cause of the broadening we concluded that a vibration-vibration resonance\nwas the likely cause of the shortening of the excited state\nlifetime, coupling the HF stretch excited state to the CH3\nstretches of the methyl radical. To test this idea, we also\nrecorded the spectrum of CD3 -HF, which is shown in\nFigure 7 (E). CD3 radicals were produced by pyrolysis of\nCD3 I. Deuteration of CH3 lowers the frequencies of the\nvibrations as shown in Figure 8, detuning the resonance,\nand resulting in much narrower lines, as expected. The\n\n\f14\nmolecular parameters derived from the fits to the spectra\nare summarized in Table III.\nIn addition to the importance of the long-range van der\nWaals forces in giving the reactants a torque, which may\nbe towards or away from the transition state [31\u201335], the\nstabilization of weakly bound reactive complexes may\nrepresent an ideal starting point for the study of reactive resonances [17]. The experimental observation of\nreactive, or Feshbach, resonances in chemical reactions\nare highly sought after because they result from purely\nquantum mechanical effects and probe regions of the PES\nwhich are typically not sampled by current experimental\ntechniques. Such resonances result from a coupling of\nthe vibrationally adiabatic PES near the transition state,\ngiving rise to dynamical trapping. To date, reactive resonances have been confirmed in the crossed molecular\nbeam reactive scattering of F + H2 \u2192 HF + H [17] and\nthe photo-electron spectrum of IHI\u2212 [176]. Resonances\nof this type are not expected to be constrained to such\nsimple systems, it is only our ability to detect or recognize them, which has limited current experiments to such\nsimple systems. Only recently has a reactive resonance\nbeen implicated in a true polyatomic reaction, namely\nF + CH4 \u2192 HF + CH3 [171]. At low collision energies\nthe transient resonance in this reaction can proceed via\npredissociation into HF(v = 2, j \u2032 ) + CH3 (v = 0), similar to F + HD [17]. The extra degrees of freedom of\nthe CH3 , however, may allow intramolecular vibrational\nenergy relaxation (IVR) which would shorten the resonance lifetime, allowing the HF(v = 2) + CH3 (v1 = 1)\nchannel to compete effectively with the pre-dissociative\ndecay described above. At higher collision energies the\ndecay of the resonance state into HF(v = 3)+CH3 (v = 0)\ndominates [171].\nFrom our experiments on the CH3 -HF and CD3 -HF complexes we can confirm a similar coupling between the\nHF(v = 1) + CH3 (v1 = 0) and HF(v = 0) + CH3 (v1 = 1)\nstates, as indicated by the vibration-vibration resonance\nlifetime, which is considerably shortened in the case of\nCD3 -HF. Overtone pumping of the CH3 -HF van der\nWaals complex may allow access to the region of the PES\ndirectly involved in the reactive resonance, as proposed\nfor F + H2 [17].\nIn order to further experimentally explore the V-V coupling mechanism observed for the CH3 -HF complex, one\ncan also alter the energy of the bright state by changing\nthe identity of the chromophore. Rotationally resolved\ninfrared spectra have been recorded for the CH3 -HCN\nand CD3 -HCN complexes [177]. As seen from the energy\nlevel diagram in Figure 8, the CH stretching frequency\nof HCN lies below the combination levels of the CH3\nmonomer, implicated in the relaxation of CH3 -HF, so\na more direct comparison of the coupling can be made\nwith just the \u03bd1 and \u03bd3 levels of CH3 . Interestingly\nfor CD3 -HCN, the combination band for CD3 is a viable relaxation channel. The peaks in the CH3 -HCN\nspectrum are well fit by a Lorentzian lineshape, just\n\nas in CH3 -HF, suggesting that the broadening results\nfrom the finite lifetime of the excited state. Comparing\nthe observed linewidths for CH3 -HCN and CH3 -HF we\nfind that the lifetime of CH3 -HCN is approximately two\ntimes longer than for CH3 -HF, suggesting that the coupling to the combination band is indeed the important\nrelaxation channel for CH3 -HF. The CD3 -HCN molecular complex exhibited linewidths which were only slightly\nsmaller than for CH3 -HCN, clearly showing that the effect of coupling to the CH stretches of the CH3 directly\nis much smaller.\nTo our knowledge no studies have investigated the possibility that combination modes are excited in the F\n+ CH4 reaction, other than pure overtones. Based on\nour observed coupling of the HF(v = 1) + CH3 (v = 0)\nto HF(v = 0) + CH3 (v1 = 1 or v3 = 1 + v2 = 1)\nit may be possible to observe this reaction channel in\nan crossed molecular beam reactive scattering experiment similar to the ones reported by the group of Kopin\nLiu [171, 178], where the experimental conditions favor\nthe production of methyl in the CH-stretch excited state,\ni. e. near threshold.\n\n2.\n\nLarger hydrocarbon radicals\n\nLarger hydrocarbon radicals, including ethyl (C2 H5 ) and\nallyl (C3 H5 ) radicals, may be readily formed by pyrolysis of their corresponding iodine precursors [74, 179\u2013181],\nand spectra have been recorded for their complexes with\nHCN and HF embedded in helium droplets. These systems are of interest since they may be directly compared\nwith the methyl radical complexes observed previously.\nFigure 9 shows a pendular survey scan for the HF stretching region. In the bottom trace C2 H5 I is flowed through a\nroom temperature pyrolysis source, and the peak at 3747\ncm\u22121 is assigned to a C2 H5 I-HF complex. Upon heating\nthe source, this peak is observed to decrease in intensity,\nand a new strong peak is observed at 3774 cm\u22121 which\nwe assign to a C2 H5 -HF complex. Turning off the electric\nfield we recover the rotationally resolved spectrum shown\nin Figure 10 (A). Figure 10 C) shows the Stark spectrum\nfor this band recorded at an electric field strength of 3.86\nkV cm\u22121 .

In Figure 11 (A)\nand (C) the field free spectrum and the Stark spectrum\nof the allyl radical-HF complex are shown, respectively.\nStill for a molecule of that size clear rotational structure\nis observed and the obtained molecular parameters are\nsummarized in Table III, together with the values for the\nallyl-HCN complex. The results on these larger hydrocarbon radicals are very promising for studying radicals\nthat are even more important in radical chain reactions in\ncombustion processes, such as, for example, Cn H2n+1 OO\nperoxy-radicals, which are some of the most important\nintermediates in these reactions [182].

HF is then picked up\ndownstream in a separate pick-up cell. We assign the peak at\n3747 cm\u22121 to an HF-C2 H5 I complex, the intensity of which\ndecreases substantially at temperatures appropriate for pyrolysis. At pyrolysis temperatures of about 1000 K, the peak at\n3774 cm\u22121 appears which is assigned to the HF-Ethyl radical\ncomplex.\n\nspectra of these molecules have been difficult to obtain\nin free-jet expansions, though [183\u2013188].\nMoreover, given that we have shown that pure effusive\nbeams of hydrocarbon radicals can be made under suitable conditions for helium droplet pick-up, the possibility\nof studying radical-radical and radical-molecule reactions\ninside the helium droplets is reasonable. A very interesting and simple experiment would be to dope a single\noxygen molecule into a droplet containing a hydrocarbon\n\nradical. Theoretical calculations predict that the reaction\nto form hydroperoxy radicals (ROO\u2022 ) is barrierless [189],\nhowever, at low temperatures this might only apply if the\noxygen directly approaches the radical center. Instead,\nthe helium might trap the complex in a local van der\nWaals minimum, forming a pre-reactive complex, similar\nto what is discussed in section VI A. Vibrational excitation could then be used to initiate the corresponding\nreaction.\n\nC.\n\nNO-HF\n\nGiven the recent observation that the \u039b doubling of\nNO was increased by 55 % upon solvation in a helium\ndroplet, there is considerable need to further study this\nphenomenon, since exciting new molecules and clusters\nmight only be formed in helium, with no gas-phase data\navailable for comparison. This statement is already particularly true given our preliminary results on open shell\nclusters with Br, I, Ga, and In atoms which have revealed\nlarge parity splittings. Indeed, recent high-level theoretical calculations on the HCN-Br complex indicate that the\nparity splitting is much smaller in a helium droplet than\n\n\f16\ninformation available so far on how the helium droplet\neffects these.\n\nFigure 11: Field-free (A) and Stark (C) spectra for the HFAllyl radical complex, and the corresponding simulations, (B)\nand (D), respectively. The peak marked with an asterisk\ncorresponds to a known impurity which overlaps at this frequency.\n\none might expect in the gas-phase [190]. The electronic\nangular momentum couplings, which are responsible for\nsuch open-shell effects, are very sensitive probes of excited electronic states. Moreover, there is relatively little\n\nTo further our understanding of such open shell species\nin helium, we have recorded the infrared spectrum of the\nNO-HF complex, which has been observed previously in\nthe gas-phase by Fawzy et al. [191]. While NO-HF is a\nbent complex, we can use a diatomic, or more generally,\na linear molecule Hamiltonian to describe the |\u03a9| = 1/2\nlevels just as one can use a closed shell linear rotor Hamiltonian for the K = 0 levels of a symmetric top. If we\ntake P as the projection of the total angular momentum\non the a-axis of the complex, then we are considering\nonly the |P | = 1/2 levels. Since NO-HF is only slightly\nbent away from linearity, these excited P states are of\nsignificantly higher energy and are not populated at the\nrotational temperatures typical of molecular beams or helium droplets. The observed spectrum in the gas phase is\ndominated by pairs of transitions, reminiscent of \u039b-type\ndoubling. In their original model, the rotational energies\nwere obtained by fitting the spectrum using\n\n1\n1\n1\nF (J) = BJ(J + 1) \u2212 DJ 2 (J + 1)2 \u00b1 [p(J + ) \u2212 pJ (J + )J(J + 1)]\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere J is half-integer, starting at J = 1/2, and the \u2212\nand + signs in front of the square bracketed term are\ndefined for the e and f parity sub-states, respectively. B\nand p are the rotational and parity doubling constants,\nrespectively, and D and pJ are the corresponding centrifugal distortion parameters. Fitting the helium droplet\nspectrum to the same model Hamiltonian resulted in the\nmolecular constants listed in Table IV, which are compared with the gas-phase values [191]. In contrast to NO\nin helium, we find that for NO-HF, the parity constant\np, is reduced from the gas-phase value by exactly the\nsame amount (within experimental uncertainty) as the\nrotational constant B. As pointed out for NO [71], the\nexpression for the parity splitting does have a linear relationship with B, and this is exactly what we see for NOHF. For NO monomer, however, the parity splitting was\nincreased by 55 % despite the fact that the rotational constant was 76 % of the gas-phase value, illustrating that\nthe mechanism with which the helium interacts with the\nmolecule is different [71].\n\nconstant (cm\u22121 )\n\u03bd0\nB \u2032\u2032\nB\u2032\np\u2032\u2032\np\u2032\nD\u2032\u2032J\nD\u2032J\np\u2032\u2032J\np\u2032J\n\nhelium droplet\n3871.76\n0.0473\n0.0479\n0.0676\n0.0802\n1.25\u00d710\u22124\n1.43\u00d710\u22124\n3.8\u00d710\u22124\n4.2\u00d710\u22124\n\n(1)\n\ngas-phase\n3877.47269(12)\n0.111320(17)\n0.116167(19)\n0.15274(19)\n0.19652(18)\n2.56(31)\u00d710\u22126\n2.56(31)\u00d710\u22126\n0.932(54)\u00d710\u22124\n0.503(38)\u00d710\u22124\n\nTable IV: Molecular constants of the NO-HF complex derived\nby fitting the experimentally observed spectrum for the HF\nstretching vibration in both helium droplets and in the gasphase [191].

Note that\nin pgopher the signs of pJ must be reversed when compared\nto the origin model of Fawzy [191].\n\nV. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HELIUM\nDROPLETS AND EMBEDDED MOLECULES\n\nSince the first spectroscopic investigation of SF6 embedded in helium droplets in 1992 [193] and the first observation of free rotation thereof a few years later [59], a\n\n\f17\nlarge number of molecules and cluster systems have been\nstudied and trends are now being established. The most\neasily recognized and well publicized trend is the effect of\nthe helium droplet on the associated rotational constants\nof the embedded cluster. Two dynamical regimes have\nbeen established. Light rotors with their large rotational\nconstants do not couple efficiently to the helium, resulting in only a slight decrease in the observed rotational\nconstant compared to the gas phase. In contrast, heavier\nrotors typically exhibit a much more anisotropic interaction with the helium, which allows some of the helium\nto follow the rotational motion, thus adding to its moment of inertia. Typically rotational constants of heavy\nrotors (B < 1 cm\u22121 ) are reduced by a factor of 2.5 \u00b1 0.5\nwhen compared to the gas-phase [1]. The scatter in the\nreduction factors of the rotational constants results from\nthe unique dopant-helium interactions for the individual\nsystems, and, for example, two similar molecules such as\nCO2 and N2 O, which have nearly the same gas-phase rotational constant, have very different helium droplet rotational constants due to the differences in the interaction\npotentials [194]. Since inside helium droplets metastable\nstructures can be formed, which may be impossible to be\nobserved in the gas-phase, there is certainly a desire to\nbe able to extract quantitative bond lengths and angles\nfrom the rotationally resolved spectra. Fully quantum\nmechanical calculations have been able to reproduce the\nexperimentally determined rotational constants for a few\nprototype systems, which is certainly a first step [195\u2013\n197]. Despite the ambiguity in rotational constants, the\noverall symmetry of the system is not affected, what can\naid in structural determinations. Indeed the nuclear spin\nstatistical weights for propargyl and all CH3 -HX-type\ncomplexes have confirmed the C2v and C3v symmetries\nof the isolated molecules, respectively.\nAs can be seen from previous reviews on the subject, almost all of our knowledge on the interaction of the droplet\nwith a dopant has come from closed shell molecules.\nFrom the admittedly small group of open-shell molecules\nstudied, which are all summarized in this review, we find\nthat the interactions are generally the same for radicals.\nThe biggest exception would be the fact that open shell\nalkali and the quasi closed shell heavier earth alkali metal\natoms are not solvated by the droplets and instead reside\non the surface, which generally results from a stronger\nHe-He interaction than the corresponding He-metal interaction. It was first unclear as to whether the interaction with an open shell molecule would be favorable at\nall, i. e. whether the radical would go into the droplet,\nbased on the known repulsive interaction between lone\nelectrons and helium droplets. For open shell atoms in\nnon-S states, i. e. halogen atoms (2 P ), the electrostatic\ninteractions with the quadrupole moment of the atom are\nquite strong, thus in general allowing for solvation.\nEven if the species goes into the droplet, a localized unpaired electron may cause density distortions of the surrounding helium, which could lower the overall symme-\n\ntry. Indeed such effects were postulated for NO, which\nwould give rise to a first order splitting of the two parity components. In that light the different effects of\nthe helium droplet environment on the parity splitting\nof bare NO and the NO-HF complex show how such effects depend on details of the molecular system and the\nmolecule-helium interactions. Theoretical support is urgently needed to describe and understand these detailed\nexperimental results.\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nHigh energy structures for chemical energy\nstorage\n\nThe possibilities to build metastable molecular cluster\nstructures inside liquid helium nano-droplets was demonstrated, for example, by observing a ring of six water\nmolecules [61] or by the self-assembly of long linear chains\nof HCN [60]. These chains are built up due to the specific kinetic control of the complex formation inside the\nhelium droplets. Since individual molecules are picked up\nsuccessively by the droplet and are rapidly cooled inside\nwith a rate of \u223c 1016 K s\u22121 , they approach each other\nisothermally at low temperature (0.4 K). Already at relatively long distance the molecules are oriented in the\nfield produced by the dipole of the complexation partner. The ground states are high-field seeking and therefore the molecular dipoles of both partners are oriented\nalong the intermolecular axis while they approach each\nother. Once they are close to each other, they find themself in a linear, hydrogen bonded geometry. Due to the\nlow temperature they cannot rearrange to form the thermodynamically more stable cyclic structures observed in\nfree jets [198, 199].\nIn the same way as for HCN it should be possible to assemble chains of polar radicals in helium droplets, e. g.\nchains of CN or OH radicals. Considering two groundstate OH radicals approaching one another from long\nrange at very low temperatures, the hydrogen peroxide structure is the global minimum product. Nevertheless, there is also a hydrogen bonded minimum at long\nrange analogous to the HF dimer [200, 201]. At long\nrange the ground state OH\u2013OH interactions are essentially the same as for the HF dimer. Since the length\nscale for the hydrogen-bond is very different from that of\nthe chemical well, it is expected that after reaching the\nhydrogen-bonded well there is a barrier to further bondcompression, before the O\u2013O distance is decreased sufficiently to access the chemical bonding region. In systems\nwith such barriers the possibility exists for stabilizing the\npre-reactive complex in the hydrogen bonded well inside\na helium droplet, in analogy to the physisorbed state in\nsurface science. The challenge is to remove the condensation energy from the system as it forms, before it can sur-\n\n\f18\nmount any barriers, thus trapping it in the pre-reactive\nform. The natural extension to larger OH clusters suggests that one might be able to make a whole new class\nof pre-reactive radical solids.\nThe qualitative description given above is supported by\nextensive theoretical studies of the hydrogen peroxide\nsystem. Particularly interesting is a high-level theoretical study by Kuhn et al., in which a minimum energy\npath analysis shows how the bonding character changes\nfrom long range hydrogen bonding to covalent bonding\nat decreased O\u2013O distances [202]. These two regions\nare separated by a significant barrier \u2013 some hundred\nwavenumbers for the highest quality potential \u2013 that is\npresumably high enough to exhibit bound states in the\nhydrogen bonded well. Moreover, the minimum energy\npath from these calculations shows a cusp at the maximum of the barrier, corresponding to a sudden change\nin the angular geometry of the complex at that distance.\nThis is due to the need for switching from a geometry\nwith the molecular dipoles oriented parallel (OH\u2013OH) to\nan head-to-head structure (HO\u2013OH).\nWith this theoretical work supporting the existence of\na barrier between the hydrogen bonded and the chemical bonded minima, there is good reason to think that\nthe pre-reactive dimer, as well as larger nanoclusters, can\nbe stabilized by following the minimum energy approach\npath analogous to the production of HCN chains [60],\ncyclic water hexamer [61], and polymers of HF [203\u2013\n206]. (H2 )n -HF clusters, which are a good model for\nthe OH/H2 metastable system, have also been studied in\nhelium droplets [207\u2013210]. These studies show that there\nis considerable control on the number of molecules picked\nup by the droplets, allowing the study of a wide range\nof stoichiometries. Generally, supermolecular structures\nwith large dipoles are favored by the formation process.\nIt has to be pointed out that all systems mentioned\nform different, metastable, structures in liquid helium\ndroplets, than obtained from gas-phase nucleation. The\nimplication is that liquid helium provides a new growth\nmedium for creating and stabilizing higher energy isomers of clusters that are not normally observed in the\ngas-phase. It is also encouraging that different clusters\nof quite large size using can be differentiated using infrared pendular state spectroscopy [60].\nTo illustrate what might be achieved by producing analogous metastable structures of radicals, consider the\nhydrogen-oxygen reactions [211\u2013213]:\n2 H2 + O2 \u2212\u2192 2 H2 O\n\n\u2206f H\u25e6 = -484 kJ mol\u22121\n\nH2 + O2 \u2212\u2192 H2 O2\n\n\u2206f H\u25e6 = -273 kJ mol\u22121\n\nand for comparison, consider the following reactions:\n2 OH + H2 \u2212\u2192 2 H2 O\n2 OH \u2212\u2192 H2 O2\n\n\u2206f H\u25e6 = -562 kJ mol\u22121\n\u2206f H\u25e6 = -351 kJ mol\u22121\n\nThus, if solids of pure OH or with a OH/H2 ration of 2:1\n\ncould be stabilized, these would exhibit exothermicities\nthat are considerably higher than that of the hydrogenoxygen system, which is widely used as fuel. As such they\nwould be ideal combustibles for high energy consumptions. From the discussion given above, there is plenty\nof evidence to suggest this could be achieved, both in\nnano-droplets and in bulk helium.\nOther systems that could potentially provide an even\nlarger amount of chemical energy storage are nitrogen\n(oxygen) oligomers, which react very exothermally to\nform stable N2 (O2 ) molecules. The N3 and N4 molecules\nhave been predicted [214\u2013216] and observed experimentally [217, 218]. The cluster formation mechanism in helium droplets described above should allow one to produce a wide variety of such metastable Nn systems from\nnitrogen atoms, where n could be much larger than 3 and\nis solely determined by the N-atom density in the pick-up\nregion.\nGordon and co-workers have shown that similar radical\nsolids can be stabilized in bulk liquid helium.[247] They\ndirected a helium beam containing atomic nitrogen into\na dewar of liquid helium, to find that a highly energetic,\nsnow-like precipitate was formed [219\u2013221]. Upon warming that material thermally detonated. Electron spin\nmeasurements have shown an unexpectedly high concentration of N atoms with more than 10 % of the N2 concentration in the original experiments. Later the experiments were optimized to obtain atomic concentrations as\nhigh as 50 % [222]. Although a number of techniques have\nbeen used to study the properties of these cryo-solids, detailed structural information is still lacking. Nevertheless\nthe authors point out that the liquid helium is only necessary during the formation process and have shown that\nthe resulting solids are stable when the liquid helium is\ncompletely evaporated, as long as the temperature remains below approximately 8 K [220]. Most remarkably\nthe authors were able to use a plunger to compact the\nsolid precipitate into a pellet without causing it to react\n[223]. They suggest that the method should be applicable to a wide range of species and we suspect that it\nwill be even more effective for molecular radicals, where\nthere are steric considerations that also inhibit recombination. A number of fascinating observations have been\nmade by this group, including the appearance of an intense green glow when the sample was irradiated with\nan helium neon laser. More recently they showed that\ncaptured N(2 D) atoms show thermoluminescence upon\nslight heating by 0.1 K or when irradiating them using\nmicrowaves [224, 225]. Details of the impurity condensation in liquid and solid helium and the interpretation\nof their X-ray and IR spectroscopic studies have recently\nbeen discussed [226].\nStructural information on such materials is clearly desirable and can be obtained from vibrational spectroscopy\non small (nanoscale) samples of these materials. Studies\nin liquid helium droplets will provide better control of the\ngrowth, as well as the ability to use high resolution vi-\n\n\f19\nbrational and rotational spectroscopy to characterize the\nresulting structures. For smaller clusters rotational resolution will be possible, providing detailed information on\nthe corresponding structures.\nThe nanosolids we are proposing to make in these studies are highly energetic and it is interesting to consider\nwhat will happen when they are vibrationally excited. If\nthe vibrational energy deposited in the molecules is sufficient to overcome the barriers that are responsible for\nthe stability of the clusters, and the energy becomes redistributed into the reaction coordinate by intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR), it is expected\nto observe strong responses to the laser excitation. This\nlaser-induced detonation (LID) will result in complete\nevaporation of the helium droplet resulting in very strong\ndepletion signals Alternatively, the clusters might dissipate the vibrational energy to the helium so quickly that\nno reaction does occur and the system simply cools back\ndown by evaporation of liquid helium atoms. These effects could be studied using IR-IR pump-probe experiments, similar to the ones demonstrated for stable species\nembedded in helium droplets [62, 63]. Considering the\nOH\u2013OH system, it is interesting to consider excitation\nof the OH\u2013OH intermolecular vibrations, i. e. using combination modes of this vibration. This will put energy\ninto the reaction coordinate and may push the system\nover the barrier and into the reactive well. Such tests\nof the stability of these solid materials are important in\naccessing the usefulness of such materials as specialty fuels. Understanding the growth of such new classes of high\nenergy density materials in liquid helium can be used to\nmake and study the properties and structures of these\nsystems on the nanometer scale. What is exciting abut\nthis approach is that it has the potential to be scaled up\nto macroscopic sizes, as demonstrated by the experiments\nof Gordon and co-workers [219\u2013222].\nConsidering the Br-HCN and HCN-Br complexes described above, it seems reasonable to allow for the formation of a metastable Br-HCN-Br complex as such a\nhigh-energy structure. Whereas we were not able to find\nthis HCN complex, first experiments using the equivalent\ncyanoacetylene (HCCCN) chromophore reveal the existence of such complexes. In Figure 12 pendular survey\nscans for the bromine-cyanoacetylene system are shown\nfor different experimental conditions. It is important\nto note that scans 12 (A) - (C) were recorded by picking up the HCCCN first, but in 12 (D) the order has\nbeen reversed, and we instead pick-up from the pyrolysis\nsource first. In scan 12 (A), only HCCCN is added to the\ndroplets, while in 12 (B), Br2 is flowing through a room\ntemperature pyrolysis source. The result of heating the\npyrolysis to the appropriate temperatures for bromine\natom pick-up are shown in scans 12 (C) and (D). In good\nagreement with the results of X + HCN, we find two\npeaks at 3326.1 and 3302.4 cm\u22121 , marked by a \u2020, which\nwe assign to the Br-HCCCN and HCCCN-Br complexes,\nrespectively, based on their frequency shifts and signal\n\nstrengths. The peaks labeled with an \u2217 were found to\noptimize at higher HCCCN pressure, therefore they correspond to complexes containing more than one HCCCN.\nThe peak at 3297.65 cm\u22121 optimizes at the same HCCCN pressure as the 1:1 complexes, however, it is found\nto optimize at higher bromine pressure, suggesting that\nit is a complex containing two bromine atoms [123, 158].\nSince it only appears in the spectrum when the HCCCN\nis picked up first, it is a good candidate for being BrHCCCN-Br, a metastable van der Waals complex containing two spatially separated bromine atoms. The dependence on pick-up order is to be expected because two\nbromine atoms will likely recombine to form Br2 in the\nabsence of the molecular spacer.\nTo aid in this preliminary assignment we performed\nbromine pressure dependence measurements [123]. This\nnew peak is found to optimize at higher bromine pressures than those peaks assigned to the 1:1 complexes,\nand agrees well with a simulation of a dimer using a Poisson distribution for the pick-up statistics. Although we\ncannot rule out that a Br-HCCCN-Br2 , or similar complex might have such a pick-up cell pressure dependence,\na double-resonance population transfer experiment [63]\nin which this new peak is pumped and the HCCCN-Br2\ncomplex is recovered would be definitive.\nIt is also interesting to note, that the the original interest in stabilizing spin-polarized hydrogen arose because\n\nFigure 12: Pendular survey scans for the Br + HCCCN system, where the bromine pressure is intentionally high to facilitate forming larger clusters. In (A) only HCCCN is picked up\nby the droplets and in (B) Br2 is flowing through the cold pyrolysis source. Scans (C) and (D) were both recorded with the\npyrolysis source at the appropriate temperature for bromine\natom production. Whereas in (C) the HCCCN is picked up\nfirst, in (D) the bromine atoms are picked up first. See text\nfor details.\n\n\f20\nof the same reasons, namely searching for novel highenergy structures [227\u2013229]. The reaction H + H \u2192 H2 is\nexothermic by more than 400 kJ cm\u22121 , yielding an very\nlarge energy-to-mass ratio if samples of atomic hydrogen\ncould be stabilized. For two polarized hydrogen atoms\ndirect molecule formation is not possible, as their 3 \u03a3+\nu\npotential is purely repulsive, and a spin-flip is necessary\nfor the binding energy of the hydrogen molecule to be\nreleased. Whereas the preparation of dense samples of\nspin-polarized hydrogen for energy storage has not been\nsuccessful yet, these studies emerged into the quest for\nthe experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation and yielded a whole new field in atomic and molecular physics [230, 231]. Nowadays similar ideas are also\ndiscussed in the context of deep space propulsion systems\nbased on antihydrogen [232].\n\nsubject to large collisional losses and is therefore not suitable for evaporative cooling [236]. The high-field seeking\nstate is collisionally stable, being the lowest energy state\nof OH, however, it does not show such long-range states\nand the collisional parameters are strongly depending on\nthe short-range potential and must be determined by a\n\"suitable experiment\" [235]. Experiments on entrancechannel complexes in helium droplets, like the ones described in this paper, would provide detailed information\non this PES.[248]\n\nC.\nB.\n\nOther applications\n\nRecently a new experiment for a sensitive search for\nthe electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron using matrix-isolated dipolar radicals was proposed [233].\nIt was suggested to measure the magnetization of an oriented sample of diatomic radicals embedded in a solid\nnoble-gas matrix. While the solid state matrix will provide a larger number density of radicals, it is not clear to\nwhat degree molecular orientation can be achieved, since\nneither the break-down voltages of the matrix nor the details of the cage effects in the matrix sites are know [233].\nAs shown for several examples in this review, pendular\nstates with a high degree of orientation can easily be\nachieved for polar molecules embedded in liquid helium\ndroplet. Therefore, the techniques of strong field orientation of radicals embedded in liquid helium droplets,\nas described in this review, might provide a well-defined\nenvironment for sensitive EDM tests.\nThe OH radical receives also considerable attention in the\nfield of ultracold polar molecules and it has been successfully confined in electrostatic traps for times > 1 s and at\ntemperatures of \u223c 50 mK [28, 234], and there is considerable interest to cool such trapped molecules further down\nto even lower temperatures. In that context the interaction of two OH molecules at very long range has been\nconsidered and for two rotational ground state OH radicals in their low-field seeking state, so-called field-linked\nstates have been predicted: bound states of long-range\nOH-OH dipole aligned dimers that are stabilized by an\nexternal electric field on the order of 10 kV/cm [235].\nSuch field linked states provide a similar degree of control\nover the chemical reaction as the van der Waals-dimers\ndescribed above. As long as the field is on, they are safely\nseparated by several nanometers in their long-range well,\nbut when the field is ramped down they can react -\nassuming that, for example, the exothermic reaction\n2 OH\u2192H2 O+O proceeds at ultracold temperatures [235].\nHowever, a gas of OH radicals in low-field seeking states is\n\nExperimental improvements\n\nThe main hurdle for studying transient species embedded\nin superfluid helium droplets is the generation of the necessary clean samples of radicals. Albeit the continuous\npyrolysis source [67] proves to be a very successful and\nversatile tool for the production of a wide range of radicals, the types of radicals that can be produced is still\nquite limited. It seems impossible, for example, to use\nit to create clean sources of oxygen or nitrogen atoms,\nas necessary for the experiments proposed above, as that\nwould require to thermally break the extremely strong\nO2 or N2 bonds.\nAlternative techniques that have been used so successfully in free jet experiments, such as photolysis or discharge sources, can not easily be coupled to the continuous droplet beam setups, which up to date in the vast majority are operated in a cw fashion. Once pulsed droplet\nbeams mature they will provide much larger droplet densities, what might allow to couple them to pulsed radical\nsources. Nevertheless, the droplet property of embedding\nany species in the scattering region requires extremely\nclean sources that would still need to be developed, but\nthe possibility of using photodissociation should help considerably to break strong bonds.\nIt would be extremely interesting to perform timeresolved studies on the processes of molecules embedded\nin helium droplets in order to study reactions and relaxation dynamics in real time. Femtosecond pump-probe\nexperiments on alkali-doped helium droplets [237\u2013239]\nshow the feasibility of such experiments. In these experiments the dynamics of the helium-alkali atom interaction could clearly be observed. In a similar way it should\nbe possible to observe relaxation dynamics after vibrational excitation of molecules like HCN embedded inside\nthe helium droplets. Once metastable radical complexes,\nas described above, can be produced inside the helium\ndroplets one could even photoinitiate their reaction and\nfollow the complete chemical dynamics from the educts\nto the final products due to the confining environment of\nthe droplets.\n\n\f21\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSuperfluid helium droplets provide a novel medium for\nthe study of transient and reactive species. A continuous pyrolysis source to produce extremely clean, effusive beams of radicals suitable for pick-up by helium\ndroplet beams was developed and the radicals embedded\nin helium droplets were studied using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. Using this setup, halogen atoms and\nhydrocarbon radicals were produced and their van der\nWaals complexes with HF or HCN were studied. In related studies NO and also a few other transient molecules\nwere studied as well. Many of the systems studied provide new, detailed information on stationary points of\nPES that were previously only studied using reactive\nscattering experiments. Even further information and\nthe possibility for optically controlled chemistry can be\nobtained using double-resonance techniques.\nThe results from these studies also provide a very sensitive probe of the quantum fluid the helium droplet environment provides, due to the influence of the droplet\nnot only on the inertial parameters, as for closed shell\nmolecules, but also on the electronic properties, as manifested in parity splitting or \u039b-doubling parameters.\n\noptically induced chemical reactions.\nHowever, the extraction of quantitative structural data\nfrom high-resolution spectra of molecules embedded in\nhelium droplets is still quite limited, due to missing accurate models for the molecule-helium droplet interaction. However, there are progresses in the theoretical\ndescriptions of these effects and they might once allow to\ndetermine accurate structural information, i. e. geometric rotational constants for the isolated molecular system\nfrom helium droplet experiments.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMost of the experimental work described herein was performed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill in the group of Roger E.

Initial\nexperiments by ourselves to use microwave discharge\nsources were not successful due to the necessary low gas\nflow and pressure, in order not to destroy the helium\ndroplet beam by a gas-jet from the discharge source.\n[247] It was recently proposed that similar effects should\nalso be obtainable in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates,\nwhere ionic impurities could lead to the formation of\nmesoscopic molecular ions [243].\n[248] In a similar approach groups from the field of ultracold\natomic physics and helium droplet spectroscopy have\nsuccessfully collaborated to obtain information on the\nPES and spectroscopy of mixed alkali dimers [244].\n\n\f"}
