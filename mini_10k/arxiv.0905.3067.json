In particular, much attention is now focused\non graphene nanoribbons[2] due to almost flat lowenergy band at the Fermi level depending on the edge\nstates. Another basic element of graphene derivatives is\na graphene nanodisk[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. It is a nanometerscale disk-like material which has a closed edge. There\nare many type of nanodisks, among which the trigonal\nzigzag nanodisk is prominent in its electronic and magnetic properties because there exist N -fold degenerated\nhalf-filled zero-energy states when its size is N (Fig.1).\nIn this paper we explore thermodynamical properties\nof the trigonal zigzag nanodisk. The system is well approximated by the infinite-range Heisenberg model. It\nis exactly solvable. A sharp peak emerges in the specific heat and in the susceptibility, which we interpret as\na quasi-phase transition between the quasi-ferromagnet\nand quasi-paramagnet states. We then investigate a\nnanodisk-lead system, where the lead is made of a zigzag\ngraphene nanoribbon or an ordinary metallic wire. We\nrefer to it as a graphene lead or a metallic lead.\nIt is shown that lead effects are described by the manyspin Kondo Hamiltonian. Electron spins in the nanodisk\nand the lead orient into the opposite directions to lower\nthe coupling energy. A new peak appears around a certain temperature (T = TK ) in the specific heat but not\nin the susceptibility for small size nanodisks. The internal energy decreases near the peak, and the band width\nof free electrons in the lead becomes narrower in the instance of the metallic lead. Furthermore, the spin-spin\ncorrelation takes the maximum value at T = 0, remains\nalmost constant for T . TK , and then decreases monotonically as T increases. We interpret these phenomena\nto mean that free electrons in the lead are consumed to\nmake spin-singlets with electrons in the nanodisk. It is\nintriguing that all electrons (only a few portion of electrons) in the nanodisk are engaged in the case of the\ngraphene (metallic) lead. They are indications of Kondo\neffects due to the Kondo coupling between electrons in\nthe lead and the nanodisk.\n\n(a) nanodisk\nN=0\nN=1\nN=2\nN=3\nN=4\n\n(b) nanodisk-lead system\n\nleft lead\n\nright lead\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Trigonal zigzag nanodisks. The size parameter N\nis defined in this way. The number of carbon atoms is given\nby NC = N 2 + 6N + 6. (b) The nanodisk-lead system. The\nnanodisk with N = 7 is connected to the right and left leads.\n\nQuasi-Ferromagnet: The size-N zigzag trigonal nanodisk has N -fold degenerated zero-energy states[4], where\nthe gap energy is as large as a few eV. Hence it is a good\napproximation to investigate the electron-electron interaction physics only in the zero-energy sector, by projecting the system to the subspace made of those zero-energy\nstates. The zero-energy sector consists of N orthonormal\nstates |f\u03b1 i, \u03b1 = 1, 2, * * * , N , together with the SU(N)\nsymmetry. Let U\u03b1\u03b2 and J\u03b1\u03b2 be the Coulomb energy and\nthe exchange energy between electrons in the states |f\u03b1 i\nand |f\u03b2 i. It follows[7] that J\u03b1\u03b2 \u2248 U\u03b1\u03b2 and that all J\u03b1\u03b2\nare of the same order of magnitude for any pair of \u03b1 and\n\u03b2, implying that the SU(N) symmetry is broken but not\nso strongly. It is a good approximation to start with the\nexact SU(N ) symmetry, by replacing U\u03b1\u03b2 and J\u03b1\u03b2 with\ntheir averages U and J, respectively. Then, the zeroenergy sector is described by the Hamiltonian[9],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nU\n1 \u2032 2\n2\n+ J ntot ,\n(1)\nHD = \u2212JStot + U ntot +\n2\n2\nP\nwith U \u2032 \u2261 U \u2212 21 J and J \u2248 U\nP, where Stot = \u03b1 S (\u03b1)\nis the total spin, and ntot = \u03b1 n (\u03b1) is the total electron number. Here, n (\u03b1) = d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03b1)d\u03c3 (\u03b1), and S(\u03b1) =\n1 \u2020\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2 d\u03c3 (\u03b1)\u03c4\u03c3\u03c3 d\u03c3 (\u03b1) with d\u03c3 (\u03b1) the annihilation operator\nof electron with spin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 in the state |f\u03b1 i: \u03c4 is the\nPauli matrix.

The relaxation\ntime is finite but quite large even if the size N is small.\nWe have called such a system quasi-ferromagnet[4].\nThermodynamical Properties:\nThe infinite-range\nHeisenberg model is exactly diagonalizable, HS |\u03a8S i =\nES |\u03a8S i, with ES = \u2212JS(S + 1), where S takes halfinteger or integer values from N/2 down to 1/2 or 0,\ndepending on whether N is odd or even. The total degeneracy of the energy level ES is (2S + 1) gN (S) with\ngN (N/2 \u2212 q) =N Cq \u2212NCq\u22121 .\nWe have a complete set of the eigenenergies together\nwith their degeneracies. The partition function of the\nnanodisk with size N is exactly calculable,\nX\nZS =\n(2S + 1) gN (S)e\u2212\u03b2JS(S+1) .\n(2)\nS\n\nAccording to the standard procedure we can evaluate the\nspecific heat CN (T ), the entropy SN (T ), the magnetization S2tot and the susceptibility \u03c7 = kB1T S2tot \u2212\n2\u0001\nhStot i\nfrom this partition function. The entropy is\ngiven by SN (0) = kB log(N + 1) at zero temperature,\ncorresponding to the ground state multiplicity N + 1.\nWe display them in Fig.2 for size N = 1, 2, 22, * * * 210 .\nThere appear singularities in thermodynamical quantities as N \u2192 \u221e, which represent a phase transition at\nTc \u2261 JN/2kB between the ferromagnet and paramagnet states (Fig.2). For finite N , there are steep changes\naround Tc , though they are not singularities. It is not a\nphase transition. However, it would be reasonable to call\nit a quasi-phase transition between the quasi-ferromagnet\n\nand quasi-paramagnet states. Such a quasi-phase transition is manifest even in finite systems with N = 100 \u223c\n1000.\nThe specific heat and the magnetization take nonzerovalues for T > Tc [Fig.2(a),(c)], which is zero in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e. The entropy for T > Tc is lower than that of the\nparamagnet [Fig.2(b)]. These results mean the existence\nof some correlations in the quasi-paramagnet state. The\nmaximum value of the susceptibility increases linearly as\nN becomes large. It is an indicator of the quasi-phase\ntransition.\nMany-Spin Kondo Hamiltonian: We proceed to investigate how thermodynamical properties of the nanodisk is\naffected by the attachment of the leads. Though there are\ntwo leads attached to a nanodisk, the lead Hamiltonian\nHL and the transfer Hamiltonian HT are expressed as if\nthere were a single lead after a certain transformation[7],\nHL =\n\nX\n\n\u03b5 (k) c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 ,\n\nk\u03c3\n\nHT = t\u0303\n\nXX\u0010\nk\u03c3\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u0011\nc\u2020k\u03c3 d\u03c3 (\u03b1) + d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03b1)ck\u03c3 ,\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nwhere ck\u03c3 is the annihilation operator of electron in the\nlead with the wave number k and the dispersion relation\n\u03b5 (k).\nWhen charges transfer between the nanodisk and the\nleads, the total electron number ntot is no longer fixed\nin the nanodisk. However, the nanodisk remains to be\nhalf-filled, when a charge transfers from the lead to the\nnanodisk and then transfers back from the nanodisk to\nthe lead. The process is the second order effect in the\ntunneling coupling constant t\u0303. We derive the effective\nHamiltonian for such a process.\nThe total Hamiltonian is H = HD + HL + HT .\nWe take H0 = HD + HL as the unperturbed term\nand HT as the perturbation term. Note that U \u226b\nt\u0303. We make a canonical transformation known as\nthe Schrieffer-Wolff transformation[10] to eliminate HT ,\ne = eiG He\u2212iG , with G the generator satisfying\nH \u2192 H\ni\nHT + 2 [G, H0 ] = 0. The dominant contribution comes\nfrom the Fermi surface, \u03b5 (k) = \u03b5F . We assume the symmetric condition \u03b5F = U + 12 U \u2032 with respect to the Fermi\nenergy. Then, after a straightforward calculation, we obe = HD + HL + HK + O(t\u03033 ), where HK is the second\ntain H\norder term in t\u0303. It is the many-spin Kondo Hamiltonian,\nX \u2020\nH K = JK\n(4)\nck\u03c3 \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ck\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 * Stot ,\nkk\u2032 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\nwith the Kondo coupling constant JK = 8t\u03032 /U \u2032 . The\ndifference between the above many-spin Kondo Hamiltonian and the ordinary Kondo Hamiltonian is whether\nthe local spin is given by the summation over many spins\nStot or a single spin S. Note that S2tot is a dynamical\nvariable but S2 is not, S2 = 3/4.\n\n\f3\n\nSpecific heat\n\n1.2\n\nwith graphene leads\n\n(a)\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nwith metallic leads\n\n(a')\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nZigzag Graphene Nanoribbon Leads: We first consider\nthe system where the leads are made of zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons.

The partition function in\nthe Matsubara form is given in terms of the Hamiltonian\ndensity Heff as\n#\n\" Z\nZ\nZ\n\u03b2\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u2020\nZ = TrS D\u03c8D\u03c8 exp \u2212\nd\u03c4 dx \u03c8 \u2202\u03c4 \u03c8 + Heff\n\n\u0010 \u03b2J p\n\u0011\nK\nS(S + 1) .\n2\nS\n(10)\nWe compare thermodynamical properties of the nanodisk\nwith leads (Fig.3) and without leads (Fig.2). The magnetization S2tot and the susceptibility \u03c7 are found to\nbe indistinguishable from those of the nanodisk without\nleads (Fig.2). In Fig.3, we show the specific heat CG (T )\nand the entropy SG (T ) for various size N . The significant\nfeature is the appearance of a new peak in the specific\nheat at T = TK \u2248 (JK /2J)Tc , though it disappears for\nlarge N . We examine the internal energy EG (T ), which\nis found to decrease around TK (Fig.4). Near zero temperature it reads\nZ=\n\nX\n\n(2S + 1) gN (S)e\u2212\u03b2JS(S+1) cosh\n\n0\n\n= TrS [exp (\u2212\u03b2HS ) ZK ] ,\n\n(5)\n\nR\nwith ZK = D\u03c8D\u03c8 \u2020 exp [\u2212SK ], where SK is the action\n\u0001\nR\u03b2 R\nSK = 0 d\u03c4 dx \u03c8 \u2020 \u2202\u03c4 \u03c8 + HL + HK . We first perform\na functional integral over the lead electron's degree of\nfreedom in ZK , and then summed up the nanodisk spin\nin (5).\nBecause an electron in the lead is constrained within a\nvery narrow region, it is a good approximation to neglect\nmomentum scatterings,\nHK \u2243 2JK s * Stot ,\n\n(6)\n\nP\nwhere s = 12 k\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 c\u2020k\u03c3 \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ck\u03c3\u2032 is the electron spin in the\nlead. The action SK is summarized as\nZ\nd\u03c9 X \u2020\nSK =\n\u03c8 (k) M (k) \u03c8 (k) ,\n(7)\n2\u03c0\nk\n\nwith M (k) = \u2212[i\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5 (k)] + JK \u03c4 * Stot . Performing the functional integration we find ZK =Det[M ] =\nexp [\u2212\u03b2FK ], where FK is the Helmholtz free energy,\nFK = \u2212\n\n1 X\nln [cosh(\u03b2JK |Stot |) + cosh(\u03b2\u03b5 (k))] . (8)\n2\u03b2\nk\n\nThis is reduced to the well-known formula for free electrons with the dispersion relation \u03b5(k) for JK = 0.\n\nEG (T ) \u2243 \u2212JSg2 \u2212\n\nJK\nSg + JK Sg e\u2212\u03b2JK Sg .\n2\n\n(11)\n\nThe first term (\u221d J) represents the energy stabilization\ndue to the ferromagnetic order present in the nanodisk\nwithout leads, while the second term (\u221d JK ) represents\nthe one due to the Kondo coupling. Furthermore, it follows that the entropy is reduced at zero temperature as\nSG (0) \u2212 SN (0) = \u2212kB log 2, as implies that the ground\nstate multiplicity at the zero temperature is just one half\nof that of the system without leads.\nThe spin-spin correlation |hs * Stot i| is calculated based\non the partition function (5) and shown in Fig.5(a). Near\nzero temperature we find\n|hs * Stot i| \u2243\n\n1\nSg tanh [\u03b2JK Sg /2] .\n2\n\n(12)\n\nIt takes the maximum value Sg /2 at T = 0, and remains\nalmost constant for T . TK , and then monotonically\ndecreases as T increases. Finally, it almost vanishes in\nthe quasi-paramagnet phase for large N since hStot i \u2248 0.\nWe may interpret these phenomena as follows. Electrons\nin the lead and the nanodisk form spin-singlet states to\nlower the coupling energy (6). The singlet state is rather\ntight for T . TK , but thermally broken as T increases.\nAll these features indicate the occurrence of the Kondo\neffect due to the coupling between the spins in the nanodisk and the leads.\n\n\f4\n(a) without leads\n\nInternal Energy\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nTc\n\n0.6\n\n(b) with graphene leads\n0.8\n\nTK\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nTc\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nN=8\n-0.2\n\nN=8\n-0.2\n\nN=4\n\n-0.4\n\n1.0\n\nN=4\n\n-0.4\n\nN=2\n\nN=2\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.6\nN=1\n\ntemperature regime as\ni\n\u2212\u03c1 h\n\u03c02 \u03b2\n2\nFK \u2243\n\u03b2DJK |Stot |\u22122D log 2+ + (D \u2212 JK |Stot |) ,\n\u03b2\n6\u03b2 2\n(14)\nwhich is valid up to the terms in the order of e\u2212\u03b2D .

(13)\n\n\u0002\nThe free energy is given by FK = \u2212\u03c1\u03b2 \u22122 \u03b2 2 DJK |Stot | \u2212\n\u0001\n\u2212\n\u2212\ne\u03b2(D\u2212JK |Stot |) \u2212Li2\n2\u03b2D log 2+Li2\n\u0001\u0003\ne\u2212\u03b2(D+JK |Stot |) , where Li2 [x] is the dilogarithm\nfunction[11]. It is reduced to the free energy of the\nnanodisk with graphene leads in the limit D \u2192 0 with\n\u03c1 = 1/2D.\n\nThe magnetization S2tot and the susceptibility \u03c7 are\nfound to be indistinguishable from those in the case of no\nleads (Fig.2). The relation SM (0) \u2212 SN (0) = \u2212kB log 2\nholds for the entropy precisely as in the case of graphene\nleads. In Fig.3, we show the specific heat CM (T ) and the\nentropy SM (T ) for various size N . A broad peak appears\nat T = TK in the specific heat. Using the asymptotic\nbehaviors[11] of Li2 [x], we obtain the free energy in low\n\nCM (T ) \u2243\n\n\u03c02 2\n\u03c1k T,\n3 B\n(15)\n\nand EM (T ) = EG (T ) + \u2206E(T ) with\n\n(b) with metallic leads\n\n0.08\n\nCorrelation\n\nCorrelation\n\n1.2\n\nN + 1 \u03c02 2\n+\n\u03c1k T,\n2\n3 B\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c02\n2\n2\n\u2206E(T ) \u2243 \u2212 (D \u2212 JK Sg ) +\n\u03c1 (kB T ) .\n(16)\n2\n6\nAll terms proportional to \u03c1 have arisen from free electrons in the metallic lead. The internal energy EM (T )\nconsists of two terms: EG (T ) is identical to the energy\n(11) for the nanodisk with graphene leads, and \u2206E(T ) is\nthe energy of the metallic lead. The first term of \u2206E(T )\nshows that the band width of free electrons in the lead\nbecomes narrower due to the Kondo coupling. We may\ninterpret that n free electrons with\nn = \u03c1JK Sg\n\n(17)\n\nare consumed to make spin-coupling with electrons in the\nnanodisk. The second term is the thermal energy of free\nelectrons in the metallic lead.\nWe show the spin-spin correlation |hs*Stot i| in Fig.5(b).\nThe overall features are the same as for the nanodisk with\ngraphene leads. However, there are new features. First\nof all, the value of correlation is quite small. This is\nbecause spin-singlets are formed only by a small portion\nof electrons in the metallic lead which are near the Fermi\nlevel. We expect that this number density is given by\n(17). Indeed, it is observed that |hs * Stot i| \u2192 21 \u03c1JK Sg at\nT = 0 as N \u2192 \u221e [Fig.5(b)].\nIn this paper we have investigated thermodynamical\nproperties of a zigzag graphene nanodisk without and\nwith leads. The lead effects are summarized by the\nmany-spin Kondo Hamiltonian. One effect is to enhance\nthe ferromagnetic order. This result is important to\nmanufacture spintronic circuits by connecting leads in\nnanodevices[9]. We have shown various thermodynamical results indicating many-spin Kondo effects.\nI am very much grateful to N. Nagaosa for many fruitful discussions on the subject.
