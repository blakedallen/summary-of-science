They all need a kind of matter with negative pressure p \u2243 \u2212\u03c1 (Kolb & Turner [13]; Bennett et al.\n[4]; Riess et al. [20]; Tegmark et al. [21]; Feng et al. [10]),\nwhere p and \u03c1 are the pressure and energy density of matter\nrespectively. People always describe them with a scalar field,\nwhich can naturally give an equation of state of \u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 0\n(Kolb & Turner [13]; Wetterich [23]; Bharat & Peebles [5]).\nIn particular, when the potential of the scalar field is dominant, \u03c9 will go to \u22121. Thus, the expansion of the Universe is\nclose to the de Sitter expansion. Recently, the observations\nof the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) shows that the spectral\nindex of the primordial density perturbation ns = 1.20+0.12\n\u22120.11\nat wavenumber k=0.002Mpc\u22121 (Bennett et al. [4]). Observations of Type Ia Supernova (SNeIa), CMB and large scale\nstructure (LSS) (Bennett et al. [4]; Riess et al. [20]; Tegmark\net al. [21]) also suggest that the equation of state of the dark\nenergy may be \u03c9 < \u22121 (Corasaniti et al.[7]). These are all\nvery difficult to obtain from single scalar field models. So it\nis necessary to look for a new candidate for the inflationary\nfield and dark energy.\nRecently, a number of authors have considered using a vector field as the candidate of the inflationary field or dark energy (Ratra [19]). We have advised the effective YM condensate (Zhang [24]; Zhang [25]; Zhao & Zhang [27]; Zhang et al.\n[26]) as a kind of candidate, which can be used to describe\nthe inflation at high energy scales and dark energy at very\nlow energy scales. In our models, a quantum effective YM\ncondensate is used as the source of inflation or dark energy,\ninstead of a scalar field. This model has the desired interesting feature: the YM field is an indispensable cornerstone\nto any particle physics model with interactions mediated by\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Wen.Zhao@astro.cf.ac.uk\n\ngauge bosons, so it can be incorporated into a sensible unified\ntheory of particle physics. Besides, the equation of state of\nthis field is different from that of general matter as well as\nscalar fields, and the state \u03c9 < \u22121 can be naturally realized.\nIn this paper, we shall discuss the evolution of the equation\nof state of the YM field and cosmic perturbations by solving\nthe zero and first order Einstein equations and kinetic energy equations. From the zero order Einstein equations, we\nfind that the YM field can easily give a state of homogeneity\nand isotropy, and it can naturally give an equation of state\n\u03c9 < \u22121 or \u03c9 > \u22121. We also find that \u03c9 + 1 \u221d a\u22122 from\nthe zero order equations. It follows that \u03c9 naturally goes to\n\u22121 with the expansion of the Universe, independent of the\ninitial condition. By considering the evolution of cosmic perturbations, we investigate the first order Einstein equations\nand kinetic energy equations. In the simplest condition with\nonly an electric field, we find that this YM field has the sound\nspeed c2s = \u22121/3 < 0, which is very different from scalar field\nmodels. We also find that a scale-invariant primordial perturbation power spectrum cannot be generated, which shows\nthat an electric YM field alone cannot be a candidate for the\ninflationary field. However, as a candidate of dark energy,\nYM field makes the cosmic fluctuation \u03c6 have a damping at\nlarge scales. This is helpful for answering large scale damping\nof the CMB anisotropy power spectrum.\n\nII.\n\nTHE QUANTUM EFFECTIVE YANG-MILLS\nFIELD\n\nIn the quantum effective YM field dominated Universe, the\neffective YM field Lagrangian is given by (Adler [1])\nLeff =\n\n1\nbF ln |F/e\u03ba2 |,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the renormalization scale with dimension of\na\nsquared mass, F \u2261 \u2212 21 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF a\u03bc\u03bd plays the role of the order\nparameter of the YM field. The Callan-Symanzik coefficient\nb = 11N/24\u03c0 2 for SU (N ) when the fermion's contribution\nis neglected. For the gauge group SU (2) considered in this\npaper, one has b = 2 \u00d7 11/24\u03c0 2 . For the case of SU (3), the\neffective Lagrangian in Eq.(1) leads to a phenomenological\n\n\f2\ndescription of the asymptotic freedom for the quarks inside\nhadrons (Adler [1]). It should be noted that the SU (2) YM\nfield is introduced here as a model for a cosmic inflationary\nfield or dark energy, and it may not be directly identified as\nQCD gluon fields, nor the weak-electromagnetic unification\ngauge fields.\nAn explanation can be given for the form in Eq.(1) as an effective Lagrangian up to a 1-loop quantum correction (Pagels\n& Tomboulis [16]; Adler [1]). A classical SU (N ) YM field\nLagrangian is L = 2g12 F , where g0 is the bare coupling con0\nstant. As is known, when the 1-loop quantum corrections\nare included, the bare coupling g0 will be replaced by a running g as used in the following (Gross&Wilczez [12]; Pagels\n2\n=\n& Tomboulis [16]; Adler [1]), g02 \u2192 g 2 = 11N4\u00d712\u03c0\nln(k2 /k2 )\n0\n\n2\n2) ,\nb ln(k2 /k0\n\nwhere k is the momentum transfer and k0 is the\n\nenergy scale. To build up an effective theory (Pagels &\nTomboulis [16]; Adler [1]), one may just replace the momentum transfer k2 by the field strength F in the following manner, ln(k2 /k02 ) \u2192 2 ln |F/e\u03ba2 |, yielding Eq.(1). The expression\nof 1/g 2 is based on the renormalization group estimates. As\nemphasized in references (Adler [1]; Adler & Piran [2]), this\nestimate is formally valid whenever the running coupling g 2\nis small in magnitude, which is true both when F/\u03ba2 \u226b 1\n(given g 2 is small and positive) and when F/\u03ba2 \u226a 1 (given\ng 2 is small and negative).\nThe attractive features of this effective YM model include\nthe gauge invariance, the Lorentz invariance, the correct trace\nanomaly, and the asymptotic freedom (Pagels & Tomboulis\n[16]). With the logarithmic dependence on field strength, Leff\nhas a form similar to the Coleman-Weinberg scalar effective\npotential (Coleman & Weinberg [6]), and the Parker-Raval\neffective gravity Lagrangian (Parker & Raval [17]). The dielectric constant is defined by \u01eb = 2\u2202Leff /\u2202F , and in the\n1-loop order it is given by\n\u01eb = b ln |F/\u03ba2 |.\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n\na\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc + \u01ebabc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd .\n\n(4)\n\nThis tensor can be written in the form with electric and magnetic fields as\n1\n0\n0\nE1\nE2\nE3\nB \u2212E1 0\nB3 \u2212B2 C\nC.\n(5)\nF a\u03bc\u03bd = B\n@ \u2212E2 \u2212B3 0\nB1 A\n\u2212E3 B2 \u2212B1 0\nFrom the definition in Eq.(4), we can find that E12 = E22 = E32\nand B12 = B22 P\n= B32 . Thus F has a P\nsimple form F = E 2 \u2212 B 2 ,\n3\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere E =\ni=1 Ei and B =\ni=1 Bi . Inserting (4) in\n(3), we can obtain the energy density and pressure of the YM\nfield given by (Zhao&Zhang, [27]),\n1\n\u01eb(E 2 + B 2 ) +\n2\n1\np = \u01eb(E 2 + B 2 ) +\n6\n\u03c1=\n\n1\nb(E 2 \u2212 B 2 ),\n2\n1\nb(B 2 \u2212 E 2 ),\n2\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nand\n\n2\n\u01eb(E 2 + B 2 ).\n(8)\n3\nEq.(8) follows a conclusion of this study: the weak energy\ncondition can be violated: \u03c1 + p < 0, by the effective YM\ncondensate matter in a family of quantum states with the\nnegative dielectric constant \u01eb < 0. The whole range of allowed\nvalues of F is divided into two domains with |F | > \u03ba2 and\n|F | < \u03ba2 , respectively. In the domain where |F | > \u03ba2 , one\nalways has \u01eb > 0, so the WEC is still satisfied. The other\ndomain is |F | < \u03ba2 in which \u01eb < 0, so that the WEC is now\nviolated.\n\u03c1+p =\n\nIII.\n\nTHE ZERO ORDER EQUATIONS\n\nA.\n\nThe Zero Order Einstein Equations\n\n(2)\n\nAs analyzed in (Adler [1]), the 1-loop model is a universal,\nleading semi-classical approximation. Thus, depending on\nwhether the field strength |F | \u2265 \u03ba2 or |F | \u2264 \u03ba2 , the YM\ncondensate belongs to the family of forms whose dielectric\nconstant \u01eb can be positive or negative. The properties mentioned above are still true even if 2-loop order corrections are\ntaken into account, an essential feature of the effective model\n(Adler [1]; Adler & Piran [2]).\nIt is straightforward to extend the model to the expanding\nRobertson-Walker (R-W) spacetime. For simplicity we shall\nwork in a spatially flat R-W spacetime with a metric ds2 =\na2 (\u03c4 )(d\u03c4 2 \u2212 \u03b3ij dxi dxj ), where we have set the speed of light\ni\nRc = 1, \u03b3ij = \u03b4j denoting background space is flat, and \u03c4 =\n(a0 /a)dt is the conformal time. The dominant matter is\nassumed to beRthe quantum YM condensate, whose effective\naction is S = Lef f a4 (\u03c4 ) d4 x, and the Lagrangian Lef f is\ndefined in Eq.(1).

From\nEq.(33)-(35), we find that \u03b4T\u03bd\u03bc is independent of the metric\nperturbation of \u03c6, which is different from the scalar field models (Weller & Lewis [22]; Armendariz-Picon et al. [3]; DeDeo\net al. [8]). The first order Einstein equations become\n\u2212 3H(H\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2032 ) + \u22072 \u03c6 = 4\u03c0Ga2 E\u03b4E(\u01eb + 2b),\n(H\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2032 ),i = 0,\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n[(2H + H )\u03c6 + \u03c6 + 3H\u03c6 ] = 4\u03c0Ga E\u03b4E(\u01eb \u2212 2b)/3.\n\n(36)\n(37)\n(38)\n\nFrom this we obtain the main equation, which describes the\nevolution of the metric perturbation \u03c6 with time:\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + 3H(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6\u2032 + \u03b3\u22072 \u03c6 + (2H\u2032 + H2 \u2212 3H2 \u03b3)\u03c6 = 0, (39)\n2b\u2212\u01eb\n. From this equation, one can easily find that\nwhere \u03b3 \u2261 6b+3\u01eb\nthe evolution of \u03c6 only depends on \u03b3 and H, but not on the\nfirst order YM field kinetic equations. This is because we have\nonly considerd the \"electric\" YM field. If we also consider the\nB components, the YM equation (38) will be used to relate\n\u03b4E and \u03b4B.\nFor the inflationary field, the most important prediction\nis that the inflation can generate a scale-invariant primordial\nscalar perturbation power spectrum, which has been found in\nthe CMB power spectrum and large scale structure. Now we\nshall firstly consider whether a Universe dominated by this\nYM field can also generate a scale-invariant spectrum using\nthe general scalar inflationary models.\nIf we consider the YM field as a kind of candidate of inflationary field, the YM field should satisfy the following\nconstraints: 1) Firstly, we should require that the inflation\ncan exist, which means that the YM field has a state with\n\u03c9 < \u22121/3. Using the p and \u03c1 in Eq.(12), one can easily get a\nconstraint on the YM field:\n\n\u01eb < b.\n\n(40)\n\n2) The energy density of the YM field should be positive,\nwhich induces the second constraint on the YM field:\n\u01eb > \u2212b.\n\n(41)\n\n3) Due to equation (39), if we can define an adiabatic vacuum\nstate at the very high frequency (k \u2192 \u221e), which requires that\n\u03b3 < 0, this would require the third constraint on the YM field:\n\u01eb > 2b, or \u01eb < \u22122b.\n\n(42)\n\nWe find these three simple constraints on the YM field cannot be satisfied at the same time, so this model cannot generate a scale-invariant primordial power spectrum as a general\nscalar field inflationary model. However, it is necessary to notice that this does not mean that the YM field cannot be the\nsource of the inflation. Recently, some authors have discussed\na kind of curvaton reheating mechanism in non-oscillatory inflationary models (Feng & Li [9]). In this kind of model, the\n\nprimordial spectrum and the reheating can be generated by\nthe other curvaton field. So, although the YM field cannot\ngenerate a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the YM field\ncan also be the background field in the curvaton field inflationary models, which will be discussed in a future work.\nHowever, the YM field can be a good candidate of dark\nenergy (Zhao & Zhang [27]; Zhang et al. [26]). Now let us\ndiscuss the evolution of the cosmic scalar fluctuations \u03c6 in the\nYM field dark energy models.\nNeglecting anisotropic stress, the potential \u03c6 evolves as\nWeller & Lewis [22]; Ma & Bertschinger [14]; Gorden & Hu\n[11])\n\u201e\n\u00ab\n\u00ab\n\u2013\n\u00bb\u201e\np\u2032\np\u2032\np\u2032\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + 3H 1 + \u2032 \u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u2032 \u22072 \u03c6 +\n1 + 3 \u2032 H2 + 2H\u2032 \u03c6\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u00ab\n\u201e\n\u2032\np\n(43)\n= 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b4p \u2212 \u2032 \u03b4\u03c1 ,\n\u03c1\nP\nP\nwhere p =\ni pi and \u03c1 =\ni \u03c1i , which should include the\ncontributions of the baryon, photon, neutron, cold dark matter, and the dark energy. Here we consider the simplest case\nwith only the YM field dark energy, and it has the equation of\nstate\u03c9de = \u22121. The 'sound speed' is defined by c2s = \u03b4p/\u03b4\u03c1.\nFrom the Eqs. (39) and (40), one finds that c2s = \u22121/3. So\nthen, the equation (43) becomes:\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + 2H\u03c6\u2032 +\n\n1 2\n\u2207 \u03c6 + 2H\u2032 \u03c6 = 0,\n3\n\n(44)\n\nwhich is the same as equation (39) with \u03b3 = 1/3. Defining\nu \u2261 a\u03c6, one gets\nk2\nu\u2032\u2032k \u2212\nuk = 0,\n(45)\n3\nwhere uk is the Fourier component with wavenumber k, we\nhave used a \u221d 1/\u03c4 , which has the solution of\nuk \u221d e\n\nk\u03c4\n\u00b1\u221a\n\n3\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\nFor the large wavelength case (k\u03c4 \u226a 1), we have\n\u03c6 \u221d a\u22121\n\n(47)\n\nand when k\u03c4 \u226b 1, one has the growing solution\nu\u221de\n\nk\u03c4\n\u2212\u221a\n\n3\n\n, and \u03c6 \u223c a\u22121 e\n\nk\u03c4\n\u2212\u221a\n\n3\n\n.\n\n(48)\n\nWe find in this universe, the evolution of the cosmic fluctuation \u03c6 is very different from that in the scalar field dark energy\nmodels. For the fluctuation with large wavelength k\u03c4 \u226a 1, it\nis always damped with the expansion of the Universe. However for the fluctuation with small wavelength, it has a rapid\ngrowth with time, which is because of the negative sound\nspeed c2s = \u22121/3 < 0. This should have an important effect\non the large scale integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect of CMB. We\nshould mention that the result in this subsection is only qualitative since we have not considered other effects, such as the\nbaryons, photons, neutrons, dark matter and so on, which are\nalso important for the evolution of the cosmic fluctuation \u03c6,\nespecially at small scales.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the effective YM field\nas a kind of candidate for an inflationary field or dark energy.\n\n\f5\nFrom the zero order Einstein equations and YM field kinetic\nenergy equations, we find that this field can naturally give an\nequation of state \u22121 < \u03c9 < 0 and \u03c9 < \u22121. This is one of the\nmost important feature of this model. Also, we get \u03c9 + 1 \u221d\na\u22122 , which suggests that \u03c9 will go to \u22121 with the expansion\nof the Universe. This makes the Universe dominated by this\nfield have a de Sitter expansion.\nWhen considering the evolution of the perturbations, we\nsolved the first order Einstein equations and YM field kinetic\nenergy equations. We find that the model with only an electric field cannot generate a scale-invariant primordial scalar\nperturbation power spectrum. This means that a model that\nonly used the YM field is not a good candidate for describing the inflationary field. However, as a kind of candidate\nof dark energy, we obtained the equation of the YM perturbation, and found that this field is very different from the\n\n[1] Adler S., 1981, Phys.Rev.D 23, 2905\n[2] Adler S. and Piran T., 1982, Phys.Lett.B 117, 91\n[3] Armendariz-Picon C., Mukhanov V. and Steinhardt P.J.,\n2000, Phys.Rev.Lett. 85, 4438\n[4] Bennett C.L. et al., 2003, Astrophys.J.Suppl. 148, 1\n[5] Bharat R. and Peebles P.J., 1988, Phys.Rev.D 37, 3406\n[6] Coleman S. and Weinberg E., 1973, Phys.Rev.D 7, 1888\n[7] Corasaniti P.S., Kunz M., Parkinson D., Copeland E.J.\nand Bassett B.A., 2004, Phys.Rev.D 70, 083006\n[8] DeDeo S., Caldwell R.R., and Steinhardt P.J., 2003,\nPhys.Rev.D 67, 103509\n[9] Feng B. and Li M.Z., 2003, Phys.Lett.B 564, 169\n[10] Feng B., Wang X.L. and Zhang X.M., 2005, Phys.Lett.B\n607, 35\n[11] Gordon C. and Hu W., 2004, Phys.Rev.D 70, 083003\n[12] Gross D.J. and Wilczez F., 1973, Phys.Rev.Lett. 30, 1343\n[13] Kolb E.W. and Turner M.S., 1990, The Early Universe\nAddison-Wesley Publishing Company\n[14] Ma C.P. and Bertschinger E., 1995, Astrophys.J. 455, 7\n[15] Mukhanov V.F., Feldman H.A., and Brandenberger\n\ngeneral scalar field dark energy models.
