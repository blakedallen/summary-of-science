Brownian\ndynamics computer simulations and real-space experiments are employed to study hysteresis effects\nin an order parameter measuring the extent of lane formation upon increasing and decreasing the\ndriving force. Both from simulation and experiment, we find that lane formation due to electrical\nfields is continuous. However, simulations show a discontinuous transition if the driving force is\ngravity.\nPACS numbers: 82.70.Dd, 61.20.Ja, 64.70.Dv, 05.70.Ja\n\nIn equilibrium, there is a fundamental difference between a sharp phase transition which exhibits a jump\nin a certain derivative of the free energy with respect\nto a thermodynamic variable [1] and a continuous crossover where no such discontinuity exists in the thermodynamic limit. This is much less clear for nonequilibrium\nphase transitions since a free energy does not exist in\ngeneral in nonequilibrium. Here, in many situations, an\norder parameter can still be defined in the steady state\nand hysteresis behaviour typically serves as a criterion to\ndiscriminate between discontinuous and continuous behaviour [2]. While it is by now well-understood how the\norder of an equilibrium phase transition is controllable\nby the interparticle interactions [3, 4], the question of\nwhich key parameters determine the existence and order\nof nonequilibrium phase transitions is much less understood due to the multitude of parameters characterizing the nature of the dynamics which do not apply in\nequilibrium.\nLane formation in a binary mixture of Brownian particles which are driven by a constant external force depending on the particle species [5] represents a prototype\nof a nonequilibrium transition in a continuous (i.e. offlattice) system [6]. Brownian dynamics computer simulations strongly support the scenario that for increasing\ndriving force the system undergoes a transition from a\nmixed steady state towards a steady state where macroscopic lanes are formed. Such a laning transition has\nbeen found in models for oppositely driven repulsive mixtures [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] in two and three spatial dimensions. In two spatial dimensions, it was found [5] that\na suitable order parameter which detects laning exhibits\na significant hysteresis - if the driving force is increased\nand subsequently decreased - which signals a discontinuous nonequilibrium phase transition. This issue is still\nunclear in three spatial dimensions. Though the general scenario occurs for pedestrian dynamics [12, 13], in\ndriven granular [14, 15] and colloidal [16] matter and in\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\ncomplex plasmas [17], a quantitative comparison of laning with simulation data and the determination of the\nunderlying order of the transition is still lacking.\nThe aim of this letter is twofold: first, we show that oppositely charged colloidal particles driven in an electric\nfield [16] exhibit lane formation in quantitative agreement with our Brownian dynamics computer simulations. Second, we address the question whether the\ntransition towards lane formation is discontinuous or a\nsmooth crossover. While charged colloids are found to exhibit lanes in a continuous way upon increasing the electric field strength, additional simulations reveal that the\ntransition becomes discontinuous if gravity is the driving force. The physical reason is that hydrodynamic interactions are screened in the electric context [18, 19]\nwhile they are long-ranged for gravity. In fact, threedimensional simulations which neglect hydrodynamic interactions completely yield a continuous transition as\nwell. Our results demonstrate that the existence and order of a nonequilibrium phase transition depends on details of the dynamics even when the particle interactions\nwhich entirely determine the order of phase transitions\nin equilibrium are kept fixed.\nIn our experiments, we used suspensions of polymethylmethacrylate colloids in a density matching mixture of cyclohexyl bromide and cis decalin into which\nwe dissolved 60 \u03bcM tetra butyl ammonium bromide\nsalt. An equimolar binary suspension of colloids fluorescently labelled with Rhodamine and 7-nitrobenzo-2oxa-1,3-diazol with volume fraction \u03b7N = \u03b7R = 0.1 was\nprepared. The diameter of both species was 1.2 \u03bcm. The\ninclusion of salt led to both colloidal species accquiring\nopposite charges of Zi = 100e, and a Debye screening\nlength of \u03ba\u22121 \u2248 300 nm [16]. The solvent dielectric constant \u01eb was 5.5, and shear viscosity was \u03b7 = 2.2 cP.\nAll experiments were conducted at room temperature\nT = 300 K. We used a Leica NT confocal laser scanning\nmicroscope. Experimental data was taken in 2D scans of\n\n\f2\ntypically 100 \u03bcm in width at a frame rate of around 2\nframes per second, ie coordinates were collected from\na diffraction-limited slice of \u223c 2\u03bcm in depth.\nIn our Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we\nconsider an equimolar binary mixture of N = 1024 oppositely charged colloidal particles of hard-core diameter\n\u03c3 at corresponding total volume fraction \u03c6 = 0.2 dispersed in a solvent whose viscosity and dielectric constant matched the experimental values, likewise we set\nand T = 300 K.\nThe simulation is performed in a cubic box of length l\nwith periodic boundary conditions in all three directions\n[20]. Apart from their steric repulsion, the particles interact via the screened Coulomb potential\nVij (r) =\n\ne(\u2212\u03ba\u03c3(r/\u03c3\u22121))\nZi Zj\n2\n\u01eb(1 + \u03ba\u03c3/2)\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i and j label the particle species, Zi denotes the\nparticle charge, r is the interparticle separation and \u03ba is\nthe inverse Debye-H\u00fcckel screening length depending on\nthe salt concentration in the solvent. We take \u03ba\u03c3 = 4\nin order to match the experimental salt concentration.\n~\n~ yields the driving forces Fext = Z \u2217 E\nAn electric field E\ni\ni\nacting on the particles. The actual electrophoretic charge\nrenormalization is taken to be Zi\u2217 /Zi = 0.8 as obtained\nfrom the averaged drift velocity in the electric field at\nlow densities [21].\nTime-dependent trajectories of the particles are\ncalculated using a finite-time step method with a\nconfiguration-dependent diffusion tensor [22]. The magnitude of friction is set by the Stokes-drag expression where the free diffusion constant is given by\nD0 kB T /3\u03c0\u03b7\u03c3H (with kB denoting Boltzmann's constant) which sets the typical Brownian time scale \u03c4B =\nD0 /\u03c3 2 . Here the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles is set very close to the interaction core \u03c3 such that\n\u03c3H = 0.98\u03c3. We use the pairwise approximation based\nthe Long-Ajdari mobility tensor [18] in order to include\nhydrodynamic interactions properly for a driving electric\nfield [19]. After an initial relaxation period of typically\n20\u03c4B the system runs into a steady state. The time-step\nused in the simulation was \u2206t = 10\u22124 \u03c4B .\nExperimental snapshots in the steady state for two\nelectric field strengths E = 30kV /m and E = 100kV /m\nare presented in Figure 1. The vertical extent of the optical slice is set by diffraction, leading to a lengthscale\nof order 2\u03bcm. The snapshots clearly reveal the onset of\nlaning for increasing electric driving field. Corresponding\nsnapshots of our Brownian dynamics computer simulations are presented in Figure 2. For sake of comparison,\nthe same field strengths were used as for the experimental\nsnapshots. The simulation configurations show a similar\ntendency towards laning along the drive direction when\nthe electric field is increased.\nIn order to quantify the extent of laning, we define a\nlaning order parameter m as follows: we assign a cylin-\n\na\n\nb\n\nFIG. 1: Typical particle configuration for positively (green\nspheres) and negatively (red spheres) charged colloids in an\nelectric field of strength E along the horizontal direction.\nOnly particles whose centres are within a slice of thickness\n2\u03bcm are shown.

By construction, the laning order parameter m equals 1 if particles\nof the same species are always on top of each other along\nthe drive but it vanishes in a completely mixed situation.\nWe have averaged this laning order parameter over many\nsimulation configurations. For the experimental data, a\nsimilar laning order parameter was obtained by using a\nprojected cylinder (i.e. a rectangular cut) to the plane\ncontaining the particles. Plots of the laning order parameter m versus the strengths of the electric field applied\nare presented in Figure 3.\nFirst, there is reasonable agreement between simulation and experiment. The increase of the laning order\nparameter with the external drive is smooth. The experimental data reveal a slightly smaller laning order pa-\n\nFinally, we consider the case of gravity in which the\ndriving forces result from a different buoyant mass of the\ntwo particle species. In particular, we treat the symmetric case here where plus and minus charged particles feel\nthe same gravitational force but just their sign is different. Our Brownian dynamics computer simulations are\nnow performed with the unscreened Rotne-Prager mobility tensor [23] replacing the screened Long-Ajdari tensor. All the other parameters are kept unchanged. In\nFigure 4 the simulation results for the laning order parameter are shown for increasing and decreasing driving\nforces. The results are compared to the case of an electric\nfield where the mobility tensor is screened due to counterion counter-motion. A significant hysteresis behaviour\nis detected for sedimentation which clearly signals a discontinuous transition towards laning while no such hysteresis is present for electrophoresis and in the complete\nabsence of hydrodynamic interactions. This clearly indicates that it is the range of hydrodynamic interactions\nwhich make lane formation discontinuous. In a strictly\ntwo dimensional system, laning occurs in a discontinuous\nway even when hydrodynamic interactions are ignored\ncompletely [5]. Therefore besides the hydrodynamics the\nsystem dimensionality plays an important role in determining whether laning is discontinuous or continuous.\n\n\f4\n\n1\n\n(a) electric field\n0.8\n\nm\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nf\n\n*\n\n150\n\n200\n\n*\n\n150\n\n200\n\n1\n\n(b) gravity\n0.8\n\nm\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n1\n0.8\n\n50\n\n100\n\nf\n\n(c) no hydrodynamic\ninteractions\n\nm\n\n0.6\n\nstrength is increased. Real-space experimental data are\nin quantitative agreement with Brownian dynamics computer simulations which include the screened hydrodynamic interactions between the driven colloids. The continuous crossover towards laning is in marked contrast\nto sedimenting colloids where lane formation occurs via\na nonequilibrium first-order phase transition as revealed\nby a significant hysteresis behaviour in a suitable order\nparameter. This change must be attributed to the longrange nature of hydrodynamic interactions in the sedimentation case. In a reduced system dimensionality, on\nthe other hand, laning is discontinuous as well even when\nhydrodynamic interactions are ignored. Hence the order\nof the lane formation is determined by both, hydrodynamic interactions and system dimensionality. Therefore\nthe more general conclusion is that the existence and order of a nonequilibrium phase transition depends on details of the dynamics even when the particle interactions\nwhich entirely determine the order of phase transitions\nin equilibrium are kept fixed.\nLane formation does not only occur in colloidal systems\nbut also in dusty plasmas where hydrodynamic interactions are absent but inertia effects play a dominant role\n[17]. We expect that, in three dimensions, the tendency\ntowards lane formation will be continuous there as well.\nIn strict two dimensions, e.g. for pedestrian dynamics\nand shaken granular matter, we expect a continuous behaviour irrespective to the details of the dynamics.\nWe thank A.
