As\na consequence of this diversity they have excited considerable interest. They\ngenerally crystallize in the hexagonal NiAs type structure although a few of\nthem possess cubic NaCl type structure. These NiAs type structures are important because of the interesting magnetic as well as electrical properties\narising from the incomplete d shells of the component transition metals [1]\nand are of great interest both from experimental and theoretical point of view\n[2,3]. Besides transformation between magnetic phases, in some cases the transitions accompany a change in crystal structure. Special attention is devoted\nto the anomalies of magnetic, elastic and electrical properties of these substances which arise at the phase transition and the nature of which has not yet\nbeen understood. In particular all these anomalies have been observed in compounds containing manganese viz., MnAs, MnSb, MnTe etc. [4]. Manganese\nchalcogenides, MnS, MnSe and MnTe are antiferromagnetic compounds with\ntransition temperatures increasing with molecular weight [5,6]. In the case\nof MnS and MnSe the stable crystal structure is cubic NaCl type and these\nare wide gap insulators. [7,8,9]. On the other hand MnTe crystallizes in the\nhexagonal NiAs type structure [10] and it is one of the few semiconductors\namong the 3d transition metal compounds. MnTe has electrical and magnetic\nproperties similar to those of NaCl type chalcogenide magnetic insulators but\nhas a crystal structure which normally supports metallic conductivity. It is a\np-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of about 1.3 eV. It orders antiferromagnetically at N\u00e9el temperature, TN \u223c 310K [11,12,13,14]. Changes\nin the temperature dependence of resistivity near TN have been attributed to\nspin disorder scattering i.e. scattering by magnons [15], a behaviour normally\nseen in ferromagnetic materials [16]. The anomalies near the TN in the thermoelectric power [17] and the Hall effect [18] are all related to the interaction\nof the charge carriers with the localized spins i.e. magnon drag effect [15], a\nphenomenon similar to phonon drag in non magnetic semiconductors. MnTe\nbehaves like an ionic crystal since the tellurium states prevail in the valence\nband, while the manganese states prevail in the conduction band. On the other\nhand dispersion of the bands indicate strong covalent effects. Thus MnTe is a\ncrossroad material sharing properties of both broad band semiconductors and\nionic salts [7].\nIn this paper we report the results of the study of crystal and magnetic structure of MnTe at low temperatures. The transport and magnetic measurements\nsuch as resistivity and D.C. susceptibility carried out on polycrystalline MnTe\nshowed anomalous behaviour at low temperatures. A rise in resistivity below\n100K accompanied by a rise in D.C. susceptibility at around the same temperature (\u223c 83K), indicative of a ferromagnetic like transition was observed.\nNeutron diffraction studies in the temperature range 10K to 300K were carried out to understand these anomalies and to elucidate the low temperature\ncrystal and magnetic structure of this compound.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nExperimental\n\nPolycrystalline samples of MnTe were prepared by the standard solid state\nroute. The stoichiometric amount of the starting materials, Mn and Te in\nmetallic form were ground, pelletized and vacuum sealed in an quartz ampoule below 10\u22126 Torr which was then annealed at a temperature of 750\u25e6C\nfor 10 days. The sample formed was single phase and homogeneous with NiAs\nstructure as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The lattice parameter values calculated from the X-ray diffraction pattern were a = 4.190\u00b10.001 \u00c5 and c =\n6.751\u00b10.001 \u00c5.\nThe sample was then characterized by temperature dependent resistivity measurement using the standard four probe technique. The DC susceptibility measurement was performed on the Faraday balance. In order to understand the\nnature of the anomalies seen in resistivity and susceptibility of MnTe neutron diffraction study has been performed on this sample. Neutron diffraction\nexperiments were carried out in the temperature range 10K to 300K at the\nwavelength of 1.242 \u00c5 using the Profile Analysis Diffractometer at Dhruva\nreactor, Trombay.\n\n3\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe resistivity and D. C. susceptibility as a function of temperature for MnTe\nis shown in figure 1. MnTe is a semiconductor at room temperature and the\nresistivity is expected to increase with decreasing temperature. However, the\npositive coefficient of resistivity seen below the magnetic ordering temperature\nTN \u223c 310K is due to the spin disorder scattering with a large contribution from\nthe influence of magnon drag [16]. As the temperature is further lowered, a rise\nin resistivity is observed below 100K. The D.C. susceptibility exhibits a sudden\ndrop at \u223c 310K indicating an antiferromagnetic order in agreement to the\nearlier reports. The anomaly observed here is the sharp rise in susceptibility\naround 83K suggestive of a ferromagnetic like order.\nIn order to understand the origin of these anomalous behaviour at low temperature, powder neutron diffraction measurements on MnTe as a function of\ntemperature were carried out. Profile refinement of the mentioned diffraction\ndata at various temperatures was carried out using the FULLPROF program\n[19]. The 300K pattern recorded for the entire setting of the detector i.e. from\n2\u03b8 = 8\u25e6 to 96\u25e6 is shown in figure 2. An intense Bragg peak due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of Mn sub-lattice is seen at 2\u03b8 \u2248 10\u25e6 in the 300K\npattern along with the peaks corresponding to the NiAs type chemical structure.

The structural parameters obtained\nfrom Rietveld refinement of the room temperature pattern are presented in\nTable 1. Since the magnetic form factor for neutrons falls drastically at higher\nangles, the low temperature diffraction data are limited upto 2\u03b8 = 35\u25e6 and are\npresented in the figure 3. The patterns could be fitted well with two phase refinement of nuclear and magnetic phases of MnTe. The magnetic cell of MnTe\n4\n\n\fcould be viewed as Mn moments aligned ferromagnetically in the basal plane\nand these planes stacked antiferromagnetically along the c - axis which is in\nagreement with those reported in literature [14,20]. The magnetic moment\nper Mn ion is found to be 0.92\u03bcB at 300K. The parameters obtained at room\ntemperature were used as inputs to refine the neutron diffraction data at lower\ntemperatures. The parameters refined were cell parameters and magnetic moment parameters, Mx and My . The fitted patterns to the experimental data\nat different temperatures are shown in figure 3 as solid lines. Absence of any\nextra peaks in the low temperature neutron diffraction patterns clearly rule\nout the possibility of any structural transition.\nTable 1\nPosition coordinates, Isotropic temperature factor (Biso ), Occupancy/formula unit\n(Occ./f.u.) and R-factors of Rietveld refinement of 300K neutron diffaction pattern\nof MnTe.\nSpace Group: P63 /mmc\nAtom\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\nBiso (\u00c52 )\n\nOcc./f.u.\n\nMn\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.84(1)\n\n1.00(1)\n\nTe\n\n1/3\n\n2/3\n\n1/4\n\n0.57(1)\n\n0.98(1)\n\nRp = 5.8\n\nRwp = 7.33\n\nBragg R = 14.7\n\nRexp = 6.48\n\nMagnetic R = 10.8\n\nThe number in the bracket represents uncertainty in the last digit.\n\nYobs\nYcal\n(hkl)\n\n10K\n\nIntensity (arb.

Neutron Diffraction pattern of MnTe at various temperatures.The top set\nof vertical lines refer to nuclear Bragg reflections whereas the bottom set indicate\npositions of magnetic Bragg reflections.\n\nA plot of magnetic moment per Mn ion estimated from our analysis is shown\n5\n\n\fin figure 4. It is seen that the magnetic moment decreases from 2.06\u03bcB at\n10K to 0.92\u03bcB at 300K. The variation of magnetic moment with temperature\nshows the Brillouin function type of dependence. The expected value of the\nordered moment at T = 0 K is 5\u03bcB . Instead, a reduced moment of \u223c 2\u03bcB is\nobserved. This is perhaps due to large dispersion of Mn bands in MnTe which\nresults in Mn 3d band being more than half-filled. The rise in susceptibility\nbelow 83K could be due to a tilt in magnetic moment away from the basal\nplane. However, a tilt in magentic moment vector away from the basal plane\nwould have resulted in increase in intesity of magnetic {102} reflection (at\n2\u03b8 = 22.35\u25e6) and decrease in the intensity of magnetic {002} reflection (at\n2\u03b8 = 10.46\u25e6). In the present case, the intensity of magnetic {102} reflection\nas a function of temperature, exactly follows the intensity of magnetic {002}\nreflection. This leads us to believe that there is no tilt in the magnetic moment\nvector away from the basal plane. Therefore other possibilities have to be\nconsidered to explain the increase of susceptibility below 83K.\n\nMagnetic Moment / Mn ion (\n\nmB)\n\n2.2\n\n2.0\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT(K)\n\nFig. 4. Variation of Magnetic Moment with temperature. Solid line is just a line\nthrough the points\n\nOwing to the magnetic stucture of MnTe, the magnetic interactions seem to\nbe strongly associated with the structural parameters and any change in the\nlatter would affect the overall magnetic interactions. In the present study, as\ncan be seen in figure 5, a and c and therefore the c/a ratio remain constant\nupto around 200K. The c/a then decreases upto 75K with c and a having a\nminimum and maximum values respectively. Below 75K c/a ratio increases\nsharply with decreasing temperature due to an increase in c and decrease in a\nvalues. The Mn-Mn interatomic distance in the basal plane is equal to a while\nalong the perpendicular axis it is given by c/2. It can be clearly seen from\nfigure 5 the change in c below 75K is much smaller than the corresponding\n6\n\n\fchange in a. Therefore the decrease in a would strengthen the ferromagnetic\ninteractions between the Mn ions in the basal plane at the same time the\nincrease in c weakens the antiferromagnetic interactions. Such a weakening of\ninter planar coupling can also explain the small rise seen in resistivity at low\ntemperatures. It may be noted that no ferromagnetic signature is detected in\nneutron diffraction patterns below 75 K that could be attributed to any structural transition. Hence the observed anomalies below 100K in the resistivity\nand susceptibility measurements are due to a magneto-elastic coupling wherein\nthe Mn ions are slightly displaced without producing any drastic change in\nthe overall crystal structure.\n\n1.618\n\nc/a ratio\n\n1.616\n1.614\n1.612\n1.610\n1.608\n1.606\n\n6.756\n\na, c (\u00c5)\n\nc\n6.753\n6.750\n\n4.200\n\n4.192\na\n4.184\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT (K)\n\nFig. 5.

The upturn in the susceptibility at around 83K\nhinted towards some kind of structural transition. However, a detailed analysis\nof the powder neutron diffraction measurements in the temperature range 10K\nto 300K do not show any evidence of an extra phase to be present within the\nlimited statistics of the data. The rise in susceptibility below 83K could be\nexplained to be due to a magneto-elastic coupling which strengthens intra\nplanar ferromagnetic interactions relative to inter planar antiferromagnetic\ninteractions.\n7\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by Inter University Consortium for DAE facilities\n(IUC-DAEF) under the project CRS-M-63.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
