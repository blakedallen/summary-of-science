Our model requires just three parameters\ndescribing the interactions - the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, and the long range van der\nWaals coefficient - in addition to known atomic properties. Without using any further details of\nthe interactions, our approach can accurately predict the locations of resonances. It can also be\nused to find the singlet and triplet scattering lengths from measured resonance data. We apply\nour technique to 6 Li\u201340 K and 40 K\u201387 Rb scattering, obtaining good agreement with experimental\nresults, and with the more computationally intensive coupled channels technique.\nPACS numbers: 33.15.Fm, 34.20.Cf, 34.50.-s\n\nThe use of magnetic fields to control and resonantly\nenhance interactions in ultracold atomic gases allows the\ncreation of highly rovibrationally excited molecules [1].\nAlongside experimental efforts, substantial work has\nbeen invested in the theory of Feshbach resonances and\nmolecules. The coupled channels technique [2, 3, 4] has\nhad considerable success, but can be computationally intense. Along with the rapidly growing number of experimentally relevant collision partners [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\nthis creates a need for accurate, computationally simple\nmodels of Feshbach resonances. Previous models motivated by this need have been based on, for example, an\nexpansion in terms of the bound states of the singlet and\ntriplet Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potentials, as with the\nvery successful Asymptotic Bound State Model (ABM)\n[10], or a fixed phase at an inner radius which is matched\nto the long range evolution of the wavefunction [11].\nIn this paper, we show how multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) can be used to construct a model\nof Feshbach resonant collisions in alkali gases that is\nboth physically motivated and computationally simple.\nMQDT [12, 13, 14] has been used to study collisions in a\nrange of systems (see, e.g., [15] and references therein),\nand is built around the idea of a separation of energy\nscales. This applies to the scattering of ultracold alkali\nmetal atoms because the hyperfine splitting and collision\nenergies are much smaller than the potential depths. We\nwill show that this enables a complete model of Feshbach\nresonances to be constructed using only the scattering\nlengths of the singlet and triplet BO potentials, and the\ncommon van der Waals coefficient of their long range tail.\nThis represents a substantial simplification over having\nto make use of whole potentials, yet leaves us with an\napproach powerful enough to make useful predictions. In\naddition, our method is computationally simple enough\nfor these three parameters to be optimized, or even found,\nfrom measured resonance data.\nA colliding pair of atoms can be described in terms of\n\nchannels |\u03b1i, defined by the state of each atom, as well\nas the partial wave of the collision, l, and its projection\nonto a quantization axis, ml . The channel energy E\u03b1\nis given by the energy of the two atoms at asymptotically large separation. Typically, multiple channels are\ninvolved, each with its own associated potential and couplings to other channels. We use van der Waals potentials\n\u03b1\nof the form VvdW\n(r) = E\u03b1 + ~2 l(l + 1)/(2\u03bcr2 ) \u2212 C6 /r6 ,\nwhere the second term represents the centrifugal barrier,\nC6 is the van der Waals coefficient, \u03bc is the reduced mass,\nand r is the interparticle separation. This approximation\nis physically motivated by the common long range form\nof the BO potentials, which converge to the form \u2212C6 /r6\nbeyond a certain radius r\u2217 . At r\u2217 , the energy scale of the\npotential is much greater than the channel and collision\nenergies. The physics occurring in the short range region\nr < r\u2217 can then be accounted for by imposing appropriate boundary conditions at r\u2217 . In fact, the separation\nof energy scales, and accompanying length scale separation, allow us to make the approximation r\u2217 \u2192 0 and use\n\u03b1\nVvdW\n(r) at all r.\nWe calculate a pair of linearly independent reference\nfunctions, f and g, from each potential by solving the\nsingle channel radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a chosen\ntotal energy, E. A channel |\u03b1i is described as open when\nE > E\u03b1 , and closed when E < E\u03b1 . An observation\nof quantum defect theory is that f and g can be approximated to be independent of energy and angular momentum at short range. They can be calculated numeri\u03b1\n(r),\ncally [16, 17, 18] or, for some potentials such as VvdW\nfound analytically [19, 20, 21, 22]. We use the analytic\napproach.\nWe next note that, at short range, the splitting between the BO potentials is also far greater than the hyperfine, Zeeman, and collision energies. We can therefore\nneglect these three contributions in this region. Consequently, the radial multichannel scattering wavefunction\n~\ncan be written in the form \u03c8(r)\n= f~(r) \u2212 K(s)~g(r), where\n\n\f2\nf~(r) and ~g(r) are vectors containing the reference functions for each channel, and bold font indicates a matrix.\nThe short range K matrix, K(s) , is to a good approximation independent of r and E.\nNeglecting the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions at\nshort range also makes K(s) diagonal in a basis in which\nthe BO potentials are diagonal. We refer to the K matrix expressed in this basis as K(BO) . For alkali atoms in\nthe 2 S electronic ground state there are several ways to\nconstruct such a basis. A convenient choice is to first couple together the electron spins of the two atoms to form\n~ = ~s1 + ~s2 . Alkalis have one singlet and one triplet BO\nS\nstate, which are described by S = 0 and 1, respectively.\n~ is then coupled to ~l to give J~ = S\n~ + ~l, which is fiS\nnally coupled to the sum of nuclear spins, I~ = ~i1 + ~i2 ,\nto give the total angular momentum, T~ . This gives the\nkets |(Sl)J, I; T MT i, which we refer to as the molecular\nbasis. The projection MT is taken along the magnetic\nfield axis.\nThe entries of K(BO) depend only on whether a channel is of singlet or triplet symmetry, and are given in\nterms of the scattering lengths as,t of the corresponding\npotentials by [22]:\n(BO)\n\u221a Ks,t\n+ tan(\u03c0/8)\n.\nas,t /\u0101 = 2 (BO)\nKs,t \u2212 tan(\u03c0/8)\n(BO)\n\n(1)\n\nHere,\nKs,t\nis the K matrix element of\nthe singlet (s) and triplet (t) channels, \u0101 =\n2\u22123/2 [\u0393(3/4)/\u0393(5/4)](2\u03bcC6/~2 )1/4 is the mean scattering length, and \u0393(z) is the gamma function.\nThe channel basis |\u03b1i, by contrast to the molecular basis, is constructed in terms of uncoupled atomic states,\nplus the partial wave of their collision. At nonzero magnetic field the projection of the total atomic angular\nmomentum f~1,2 = ~i1,2 + ~s1,2 onto the magnetic field\nquantisation axis, m1,2 , is a good quantum number, but\nfi itself is not. The states are then described by the\nkets |\u03b11 m1 , \u03b12 m2 , lml i, which we refer to as the Zeeman\nbasis. Here, \u03b11,2 = a, b, c . . . label the energy ordered\natomic Zeeman states [1].\nWe obtain K(s) using a frame transformation [23, 24]\nfrom the molecular basis to the Zeeman basis. This\nmagnetic-field dependent, unitary transformation can be\ncalculated in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and\nthe Wigner 6j and 9j symbols using angular momentum\nalgebra [25]. For the case of identical atoms, it is simple\nto incorporate the relevant Bose/Fermi symmetrisation.\nWriting the frame transformation as a matrix U, we have\nK(s) = UK(BO) U\u2020 .\nWe next calculate the long range K matrix, K(E),\nfrom which the observable scattering properties can be\nextracted. Unlike K(s) , the long range K matrix is energy dependent because of the van der Waals tail of the\npotentials. For a multichannel problem with both open\n\nand closed channels, K(E) is given by [22]\n(s)\n\nK(E) = \u2212[Zf g (E) \u2212 Zgg (E)Keff ]\n(s)\n\n\u00d7 [Zf f (E) \u2212 Zgf (E)Keff ]\u22121 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n(s)\n\n(s)\n(s) \u22121 (s)\nKco .\nKeff = K(s)\noo + Koc [\u03c7(E) \u2212 Kcc ]\n\n(3)\n\nHere, the subscripts 'o' and 'c' refer to the open and\nclosed channel blocks of the K matrix. The energy dependent, diagonal Z matrices are given by the long range\nbehavior of the reference functions f and g, and represent\nthe propagation of a wavefunction from small to large\ndistances. The diagonal matrix of the bound state phase\nin the closed channels, \u03c7(E), is analogously defined [22]\nand, as shown by the structure of Eq. (3), gives rise to\nthe resonant enhancement of the collisions. It also allows\nthe calculation of bound state energies from the determinental equation\ndet(\u03c7(E) \u2212 K(s)\ncc ) = 0 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe Z and \u03c7 matrix entries are evaluated for each channel |\u03b1i at the magnetic field dependent energy E\u2212E\u03b1 (B).\nFinally, the S matrix, which we use to extract the observable scattering properties, may be calculated from\nS(E) = [I + iK(E)][I \u2212 iK(E)]\u22121 , where I is the identity\nmatrix. By approximating the short range interactions\n\u03b1\nto be energy independent, and using the form VvdW\n(r)\nfor the potentials, we have therefore reduced the scattering problem to one involving just three parameters: as ,\nat , and C6 .\nOur code is sufficiently fast that it is possible to search\nover the whole (as , at ) plane. Given one field at which a\nresonance occurs, and assuming that C6 is known, lines\nthrough the (as , at ) plane are typically found which result\nin a resonance at this field. Further resonances reduce the\npossible range for each scattering length. For more accurate determinations, least squares minimization using\nall available resonance locations then gives optimal values of as and at . We note that the values thus found can\nbe different to those produced by a full coupled channels\ncalculation using realistic potentials, and should be interpreted as fit parameters that will in general be close to\nthe real scattering lengths. Nonetheless, the scattering\nlengths found can be used for the prediction of unobserved resonances. This could make our technique useful\nfor investigating new collision partners.\nAs an example application of our code we consider\ncold collisions of 6 Li and 40 K atoms. The analysis of\nRef. [10] found as = 52.1 a0 , at = 63.5 a0 , and C6 =\n2322 Eha60 . Here, a0 = 0.0529177 nm is the Bohr radius, and Eh = 4.35974 \u00d7 10\u221218 J. With these input\nparameters, we find s-wave resonances in the aa channel at 17.08 mT and 18.13 mT.

However, allowing the singlet and triplet\nscattering lengths to vary, we find optimal agreement for\nas = 53.17 a0 and at = 64.41 a0. These values were obtained using a least squares minimization, comparing our\nresults to the experimentally observed locations of the\nthirteen resonances listed in Table I. Our results, obtained from only the given C6 and by varying the scattering lengths, agree well with the more computationally\nintensive coupled channels approach, and with the experimental results. The abovementioned resonances, for\nexample, are found at 15.93 mT and 17.01 mT, a disagreement of approximately 1 %.\nThe s-wave resonances in the ac channel listed in Table I are illustrated in Fig. 1. The two panels show the\neffect of a Feshbach state below and above the threshold\nat which it causes a resonance. The lower panel shows the\nbound state energies as a function of magnetic field. The\nupper panel shows sin2 \u03b40 (E), where \u03b40 (E) is the s-wave\nscattering phase shift in the ac channel. In this example, there is one open channel and eleven closed channels.\nConsequently, the s-wave phase shift is linked to the S\nmatrix by S(E) = e2i\u03b40 (E) . Resonances can be recognised by the sudden change in the value of sin2 \u03b40 (E).\nAs a second example we consider 40 K\u221287 Rb scattering.\nIn Fig. 2a we compare an MQDT calculation of s-wave aa\nchannel resonances to three coupled channels calculations\nusing two different pairs of singlet and triplet power law\npotentials, and the potentials of Pashov et al.

[26]. These values for the\nscattering lengths and C6 are also used in the MQDT\ncalculation, without varying their values as in the example above, to allow direct comparison. The resulting\nresonance locations illustrate the two main approximations of our approach. Firstly, we approximate the short\nrange K matrix to be energy independent. The validity\nof this is shown by the close agreement of the MQDT\nresult to that of the coupled channels calculation with\n\u2212C6 /r6 + C12 /r12 potentials. These quickly converge to\npure van der Waals potentials as r increases, only having significant C12 contributions at distances where the\nhyperfine energies are small compared to C6 /r6 .\nOur second important approximation is the use of a\npure van der Waals potential. Other dispersion contributions to the potential, such as the attractive \u2212C8 /r8\nterm, can be important, as shown in Fig. 2a. The\n\u2212C8 /r8 term, taken from Ref. [26], has a sufficiently long\nrange to give deviations from the pure van der Waals result. These results are closer to those given by the full\npotential. MQDT using numerical reference functions\nbased on a more detailed potential [11] could be more\naccurate, but would be more computationally involved.\nAnother way of illustrating the differences between\nthe calculations is by studying the near-threshold bound\nstates, which we show for the aa channel in Fig. 2b. The\ndifference between the MQDT result and that of the coupled channels calculation using the potential of Ref. [26]\nis primarily due to the zero field bound state locations being different, which is a consequence of the different singlet and triplet potentials.

A frame transformation allows us to link short range, where we can neglect the energy dependence of the interactions, to long\nrange, where we can use an approximate potential with\nanalytic reference functions. We are therefore able to\npredict and study resonances on the basis of three input\nparameters - as , at and C6 - in addition to known atomic\nproperties. Our approach is significantly less computationally challenging than the coupled channels approach\nand, by using the scattering lengths as fit parameters,\ncould enable useful predictions to be made while investigating new collision partners.\nWe gratefully acknowledge Bo Gao for supplying us\nwith his codes for calculating the Z(E) and \u03c7(E) matrices.

The upper panel shows scattering length vs magnetic field. The\nMQDT results are given by the approach presented in this\npaper. The other results are given by coupled channels calculations with potentials of the form \u2212C6 /r 6 + C12 /r 12 (6\u201312),\n\u2212C6 /r 6 \u2212 C8 /r 8 + C12 /r 12 (6\u20138\u201312), and the potentials of\nRef. [26] (full). The full potentials were also used to calculate the bound state spectrum ('o') which is compared to an\nMQDT calculation ('+') in the lower panel. Bound states are\nnumbered according to the vibrational quantum number of\nthe singlet and triplet states which give rise to them. Note\nthat the two plots have different ranges of magnetic field.\n\narising from the most weakly bound (v = \u22121) level, agree\nto approximately 1%, whereas the more deeply bound\nv = \u22122 and \u22123 states deviate more significantly. The\nMQDT bound state energies become less accurate as\nbinding energy increases, as non van der Waals contributions become more important. This implies that resonances due to more deeply bound levels will be less accurately reproduced by the MQDT model. The fit procedure discussed above partially compensates for this. We\nnote that the ABM method [10] has been shown to accurately predict the locations of 40 K\u221287 Rb resonances [27].\nThe MQDT model can give a qualitative indication of\nresonance widths, as shown in Table I. In coupled channels calculations, resonance widths are determined primarily by the difference between the singlet and triplet\npotentials. This is not included in the MQDT model,\nwhere the only difference between the two is in their scattering lengths. Lastly, we note that our MQDT approach\n\n[1] T. K\u00f6hler, K. G\u00f3ral, and P.
