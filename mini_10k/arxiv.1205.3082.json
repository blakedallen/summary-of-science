The facility is designed to\nsupport programs in elementary particle and nuclear\nphysics, with possible applications to nuclear energy\nresearch. A Functional Requirements Specification has\nbeen developed in order to establish performance criteria\nfor the Project X complex in support of these multiple\nmissions, and to assure that the facility is designed with\nsufficient upgrade capability to provide U.S. leadership\nfor many decades to come. This paper will briefly review\nthe previously described Functional Requirements, and\nthen discuss their recent evolution.\n\nPROJECT X MISSION AND GOALS\nProject X is a high intensity proton facility that would\nsupport a world-leading U.S. program in Intensity\nFrontier physics over the next several decades. Project X\nis currently under development by Fermilab with both\nnational and international partners.\nThe primary mission elements to be supported by\nProject X include:\n1.\n\nProvide a neutrino beam for long baseline neutrino\noscillation experiments, based on targeting at least\n2 MW of proton beam power at any energy\nbetween 60 \u2013 120 GeV.\n\n2.\n\nProvide MW-class, 1-3 GeV, proton beams\nsupporting multiple kaon, muon, neutrino, and\nnuclei-based precision experiments. Simultaneous\noperation with the long baseline neutrino program\nis required.\n\n3.\n\nProvide a path toward a muon source for a possible\nfuture Neutrino Factory and/or a Muon Collider.\n\n4.\n\nProvide opportunities for nuclear energy\napplications with high duty factor MW-class beams\nat 1 GeV.\n\nThese elements represent the fundamental design\ncriteria for Project X. A design concept, designated the\nReference Design [1], has been established supporting\nthese elements in an innovative and flexible manner. The\nReference Design is based on a 3 GeV superconducting\nCW linac, augmented by a superconducting pulsed linac\nfor acceleration from 3 to 8 GeV.\n\nPROJECT X REFERENCE DESIGN\nThe Reference Design has been previously described in\n[2].

The following should\nbe noted in this strategy: 1) maintenance of a 1 MW\navailable beam power at 1 GeV, simultaneous with 3 MW\navailability at 3 GeV would require an upgrade of the rf\nsystem to support 2 mA average current in the first 1 GeV\nof the linac. A decision to implement such an upgrade as\n\n\fpart of Stage 2 would be taken on the basis of\nprogrammatic goals following the completion of Stage 1.\n2) 8 GeV beams are delivered from the existing Fermilab\nBooster in Stages 1 and 2, and from the 8 GeV Project X\npulsed linac in Stage 3.\n\nMuon Facilities\nThe Reference Design configuration provides a\npowerful source of protons that could provide a platform\nfor a muon-based Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider.\nHowever, the Reference Design on its own is insufficient,\nand will require upgrades to provide the required beam\nparameters. These upgradability requirements are\ncaptured in the \"Upgradability\" section of the Functional\nRequirements (Table 1).\nThe Muon Collider requires approximately 4 MW of\nbeam power delivered onto a production target at an\nenergy between 5 and 15 GeV. The 8 GeV pulsed linac of\nProject X, suitably modified, can meet this particular\nneed. However, a very low duty factor beam is required,\nfor example the Muon Collider requires beam delivered in\na single bunch, with a bunch length of 2-3 nsec, at a 15\nHz repetition rate [5]. Requirements are modestly relaxed\nfor a Neutrino Factory.\nProviding the required beam power and bunch structure\nfor a Muon Collider will require both an upgrade of the\nProject X 8 GeV beam power and additional facilities to\nreformat the high duty factor beam from Project X.\nProject X naturally provides 350 kW of beam power at 8\nGeV (Table 2). The strategy for providing 4 MW at 15 Hz\nis to increase the current to 5 mA, increase the pulse\nlength to 6.7 msec, and increase the repetition rate to 15\nHz. The result is a 10% duty factor at 5 mA, or 4 MW\ndelivered from the pulsed linac at 8 GeV. These\nrequirements are documented as requirements U1 and U5\nin Table 1.\nAdditionally the beam delivered at 8 GeV must be\nreformatted to provide the very low duty factor required\nfor muon facilities. It is believed that two rings will be\nrequired: 1) an accumulation ring that collects the 6.7\nmsec long H- pulse and segregates it into roughly 4-8\nbunches; and 2) a compressor ring that reduces the bunch\nto the required 2-3 nsec. This would be followed by a\n\"trombone\" beam line that utilizes varying times of flight\nto deliver multiple bunches onto the production target\nsimultaneously. These concepts require further\ndevelopment to establish viability.\n\nShort Baseline Neutrinos\nThere has been significant recent interest in the\ndevelopment of multi-MW proton sources at low (<10\nGeV) energy either for short baseline or low energy long\nbaseline neutrino experiments [6, 7]. These experiments\nalso require low (10-4 or less) duty factors. Fortunately\nthese requirements are nearly identical to the Muon\nFacility requirements. Hence, a common strategy could be\nemployed that would provide both the intermediate term\n\nbenefit of 4 MW of beam power at 8 GeV for neutrino\nexperiments, but a longer term opportunity for muonbased facility.\n\nStage 4\nThe above considerations have led to the identification\nof a \"Stage 4\" configuration of Project X that goes\nbeyond the Reference\nDesign and provides\n(simultaneously) up to 3 MW at 3 GeV, 4 MW at 8 GeV,\nand 4 MW at 120 GeV. This configuration is associated\nwith the requirements for the Muon Facilities and Short\nBaseline Neutrino requirements described above.\n\nSUMMARY\nProject X is central to the strategy for future\ndevelopment of the Fermilab accelerator complex. A\nReference Design has been developed that will support a\nworld leading program in neutrinos and other rare\nprocesses over the coming decades, and will provide a\nplatform for future muon-based facilities \u2013 either a\nNeutrino Factory or a Muon Collider. A set of Functional\nRequirements forms the basis of the design, and provides\nflexibility for staging opportunities and for long-term\nupgradability of the complex.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Project X Reference Design Report, November 2010,\nhttp://projectx-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgibin/ShowDocument?docid=776\n[2] S.
