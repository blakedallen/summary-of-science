In the Ehrenfest wind-tree model [4], the point-like (\"wind\") particles\nmove on a plane and collide with randomly placed fixed square scatterers (\"tree\").\nThis model has been recently reconsidered in [5] to prove that microscopic chaos is not necessary for Brownian motion. A one-dimensional version of this model has been considered in\n[6] to investigate the origin of diffusion in non chaotic systems. In [6] the authors identify\ntwo sufficient ingredients for diffusive behavior in one-dimensional, non-chaotic systems: a) a\nfinite-size, algebraic instability mechanism, and b) a mechanism that suppresses periodic orbits. A nonequilibrium modification of the model, with regularly placed scatterers, has been\nproposed in [7] to test the applicability of the so called fluctuation relation ([8, 9, 10, 11])\nto non chaotic systems. This modified model was chosen under the assumption that, at small\nand vanishing fields at least, it must be non-chaotic, since collisions with flat boundaries do\nnot lead to exponential separation of nearby phase space trajectories.\nHowever the question of whether such a model can have positive Lyapunov exponents, as\nfunctions of the field, is open. Indeed, the techniques so far developed, e.g. by Chernov and\nWojtkowski [2, 3], rely on the dispersing nature of the billiard obstacles.\nIn this paper, the dynamical properties of the nonequilibrium version of the Ehrenfest gas\nare considered as functions of the field and of the parameters which determine the billiard\ntable. Numerical tests are performed to find chaotic attractors and to compute the Lyapunov exponents. The construction of a sort of bifurcation diagram of the attractor as a\nfunction of the electric field and of the geometry is attempted. The result turns out to be\nquite peculiar: chaotic regimes with an extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters\nappear possible, although not easy to establish rigorously. If this model can be taken to\napproximate the transport of matter in microporous membranes, our results confirm the\nsensitive dependence of microporous transport on all relevant parameters observed e.g. in\n[12, 13]. Indeed, the current of the nonequilibrium Eherenfest gas is proportional to the\nsum of the Lyapunov exponents (cf. Eq.(11) below), which varies with the parameters as\nirregularly as the attractors do.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe billiard table consists of rhombi of side length l with distances along the x and\ny directions between the centers of two nearest neighbouring rhombi given by xL and yL ,\nrespectively. The centers of the rhombi are fixed on a triangular lattice in a plane and have\ncoordinates\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nxc\nyc\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 = mc l1 + nc l2 ,\n\nmc , nc \u2208 Z\n\nwhere l1 = (xL , 0) and l2 = (0, yL ) are the lattice vectors. If all the pairs (mc , nc ) are\nselected, the billiard is invariant under the group of spatial translations generated by l1 and\nl2 . Accordingly, the whole lattice can be mapped onto a so-called Wigner-Seitz cell, with\nperiodic boundary conditions (Figure 1). The elementary Wigner-Seitz cell of the triangular\nlattice is a hexagon of length side L and area\nAW S = |l1 \u00d7 l2 |.\nThe centers of all other cells are identified by the pairs (mc , nc ) \u2208 ZE \u00d7 ZE or (mc , nc ) \u2208\nZO \u00d7 ZO where ZE = {n \u2208 Z : |n| is even},\n\nZO = {n \u2208 Z : |n| is odd}. Because of\n\nthe bi\u2013jective correspondence between rhombi and pairs (mc , nc ), one may label a generic\nrhombus by Rmc ,nc and the corresponding hexagon by Hmc ,nc . Further, a label can be put\non the sides of the rhombi and of the hexagons, introducing an alphabet A = {r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 },\nstarting from the right vertical side and oriented clockwise, for the sides of the rhombi and\nan alphabet B = {h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 } for the hexagon sides, starting from the right vertical\nside and oriented clockwise. In this alphabet, the sides of a generic rhombus of the lattice\ncan be labelled by a triple (Rmc ,nc , s) with s \u2208 A, while the hexagon side with a triple\n(Hmc ,nc , s) = (mc , nc , s) with s \u2208 B. The rhombi lying in the y axes have R0,i = (0, i) with\ni \u2208 ZO and the ones lying in the x axes have Rj,0 = (j, 0) with j \u2208 ZE .\n\nThe geometry of the model is determined by the side L of the hexagonal Wigner-Seitz cell,\n\u221a\nso that xL = 3/2 and yL = 3L/2. Let R0 = (0, 0) be the rhombus with the center in the\norigin of the Cartesian coordinates, l its sides length, sx and sy the half length of the major\np\nand minor diagonals respectively, so that l = s2x + s2y . To prevent the overlap of rhombi,\nthe side length of the rhombus inside one hexagon has to verify\n\n\f4\n\u221a\n\n7\nL\n2\n\u221a\n7\nwhich implies 0 \u2264 sx \u2264 xL . The case with l =\nL corresponds to a billiard table which\n2\nwas recently \u221a\nconsidered in [12, 13].\n\u0010\n7 \u0011\nTake l \u2208 0,\nL , hence sx < xl . The horizon of the billiard depends on the quantity sy\n2\nand in particular on the difference yL \u22122sy . If sy \u2265 yL /2, the horizon is finite; if sy < yL /2, it\n0\u2264l\u2264\n\nis infinite. The infinite horizon case allows collision-free trajectories, parallel to the x\u2212axis.\nWhen the dynamics is followed within to the Wigner-Seitz cell, the position of the point\nparticle of mass M must be supplemented by the couple (mc , nc ), in order to determine\nits actual position in the infinite plane. The space between the rhombi forms the twodimensional domain, in which the particle moves with velocity v during the free flights,\nwhile collisions with the sides of the rhombi obey the law of elastic reflection.\nIn order to drive the model out of equilibrium, an external electric field parallel to the x-axis,\nE = \u01ebb\nx is applied. If there were no interaction with a thermal reservoir, any moving particle\nwould be accelerated by the external field, on average, leading to an indefinite increase\nof energy in the system, and there would be no stationary state. Therefore, in [7] the\nparticle has been coupled to a Gaussian thermostat. The resulting model, with periodically\ndistributed scatterers, has been called the non-equilibrium Ehrenfest gas. Its phase space\nhas four coordinates (x, y, px , py ) and its equations of motion are given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u1e8b = p /M ,\np \u0307x = \u01eb \u2212 \u03b1(p)px\nx\nwith\n\u03b1(p) = \u2212\u01ebpx\n\uf8f3 \u1e8f = py /M ,\np \u0307y = \u2212\u03b1(p)py\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the electric field and \u03b1 the Gaussian thermostat. The quantity \u2212div(\u1e57, q\u0307) =\n\n\u03b1 = \u01ebpx is known as the phase space contraction rate. Because of the Gaussian thermostat,\np2x + p2y is a constant of motion, hence there are only three independent variables, and one\nmay replace px and py by the angle \u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] that p = p(cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) forms with the x-axis.\nFor sake of simplicity, we set M = 1 and p = 1.\nThen, if (xt , yt ) denotes the position at time t and \u03b8t the velocity angle, measured with\nrespect to the x-axis, the trajectory between two collisions reads [14]\n\uf8f1\nsin \u03b8t\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx = x0 \u2212 1\u01eb ln sin\n\uf8f4\n\u03b8t 0\n\uf8f2 t\n1\nyt = y0 \u2212 \u01eb (\u03b8t \u2212 \u03b8t0 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 tan \u03b8t = exp(\u2212\u01eb(t \u2212 t0 )) tan \u03b8t0\n2\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\f5\nwhere t0 is the time of the previous collision, while the collision map C is given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx\u2032 = xt\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 t\nyt\u2032 = yt\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b8\u2032 = \u2212\u03b8t \u00b1 2\u03b8\n\n(3)\n\nt\n\nwhere \u03b8t is the incidence angle, (xt , yt ) is the collision point and \u03b8 is the angle that the side of\nthe rhombus makes with the x\u2212axis. The sign \u00b1 depends on the side on which the bounce\noccurs. Hence C is piecewise linear in \u03b8t .\n\nConsidering the dynamics as a geodesic flow on a Riemann manifold, the appropriate metric\nfor this system is [15, 16, 17]\nds2 = e\u22122\u01ebx (dx2 + dy 2 )\nwhich implies that the quantities \u03c0y = e\u2212\u01ebx py and \u03c6t = \u03b8t + \u01ebyt = \u03b8t0 + \u01eb\u03b8 are conserved.\nAlso, the path length L(P0 , Pt ) between P0 = (x0 , y0, \u03b8t0 ) and Pt = (xt , yt , \u03b8t ) turns out to\nbe\n1\nL(P0 , Pt ) = e\u2212\u01ebx0 sin \u03b8t0 | cot \u03b8t0 \u2212 cot \u03b8t |.\n\u01eb\n\nIII.\n\nPERIODIC ORBITS AND STABILITY MATRICES\n\nUsing the symbols introduced above,\nsists of N\n\n(4)\n\na trajectory segment \u03a9N\n\nwhich con-\n\ncollisions can be labelled by a finite symbolic sequence such as\n\n(Ri1 ,j1 , s1 )(Ri2 ,j2 , s2 ) . . . (RiN ,jN , sN ), with (ic , jc ) \u2208 ZE \u00d7 ZE or (ic , jc ) \u2208 ZO \u00d7 ZO and\nsc \u2208 A for c = 1, . . . , N. Periodic trajectories will be labelled by sequences which are infinitely many copies of a fundamental finite sequence.\nThere are two types of periodic orbits; those that are periodic in the plane, i.e. that return\nto the initial point in the plane (they are closed : \u2206xi = 0, \u2206yi = 0) and those whose periodicity relies upon the periodicity of the triangular lattice, and return to the same relative\nposition in a different cell (they are open: \u2206xi 6= 0 or \u2206yi 6= 0).\nThe velocity vectors of the closed orbits with two collisions have to be orthogonal to both\nsides of the rhombi where collisions occur.

This, implies that both Lyapunov exponents\nvanish.\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL ESTIMATES OF LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS\n\nIn this paper, a system is called chaotic when it has at least one positive Lyapunov\nexponent. We note that the boundary of our system is not defocussing and the external\nfield has a focussing effect, so the overall dynamics should not be chaotic in general, although\nit is not obviuos that this is the case for all values of the electric field \u01eb. In this section we\nexamine the stationary state and the Lyapunov exponents, obtained by using the algorithm\ndeveloped by Benettin, Galgani, Giorgilli and Strelcyn [19], for different values of \u01eb, ranging\nfrom small to large fields.\n\nA.\n\nChaos for large electric fields\n\nNumerical simulations of the model starting with random initial conditions and electric\nfield in the range [0.02, 1] have been initially performed for a trajectory of length n = 107\ncollisions. The parameters chosen for the geometry are L = 1.291, sx = 0.7573 and sy = 1.1\nwhich correspond to a case in which the angles of the rhombi are irrational w.r.t. \u03c0, then,\naccording to a conjecture by Gutkin [20], the equilibrium version of this model, (i.e. the\n\u01eb = 0 case), should be ergodic. For simulations of 107 collisions, Figure 3 shows that the\nfields which appear to lead to one positive Lyapunov exponent cover a range larger than\nthat which appears to correspond to two negative exponents. However, do 107 collisions\nsuffice for a generic trajectory to characterize the stationary state? For the cases with\n\n\f9\ntwo negative exponents the answer is affirmative, since the trajectory is clearly captured\nby an attracting periodic orbit. But the cases with one apparently positive exponent are\nnot equally clear. As [7] already noted, the doubt is that, starting from a generic initial\ncondition, convergence to the steady state might be too slow to be discovered, for reasons\nwhich had not been investigated. Indeed, even in cases in which convergence is observed,\nthe particle often appears to peregrinate in a sort of chaotic quasi steady state for very\nlong times, before eventually settling on a periodic or quasi-periodic steady state. Ref. [7]\nsuggested this might always be the case.\nTherefore, we extended the simulations of the cases with one apparently positive Lyapunov exponent, up to 1.5 \u00d7 108 collisions. The behaviour of the system still appears to be\n\nnon trivial, in cases such as that of \u01eb = 0.374. Furthermore, plotting the last 104 iterates\nof a trajectory of length 5 \u00d7 107 collisions, we cover a large fraction of the phase space,\n\nwhich appears quite close to that covered by the last 104 iterates of a trajectory of 1.5 \u00d7 108\ncollisions (Figure 4).\n\nThe conclusion that a chaotic stationary state has been reached seems reasonable in this\ncase, as the computed positive Lyapunov exponent also indicates, having apparently converged to 0.144 with three digits of accuracy, after only 106 collisions.\nTo strengthen this results, we have looked for an unstable periodic orbit embedded in the\nattractor, and we have found one periodic orbit of period four, which apparently lies in\nthe attractor and has a positive Lyapunov exponent (Figure 5, right panel). The other\npossibility is that the orbit is isolated, and is separated from the attractor by such a small\nneighborhood that is numerically impossible to resolve.\nAnother interesting example is given by \u01eb = 0.5: the last 7000 points of a trajectory of\nlength 5 \u00d7 107 collisions are compared with the last 104 points of the trajectory of length\n\n2 \u00d7 108 (Figure 6). Also in this case the stationary state seems to have been reached, and\na periodic orbit of period four with one positive Lyapunov exponent seems to be embedded\nin the attractor, similarly to the case of \u01eb = 0.374. The values of \u01eb, of the initial conditions\nand the Lyapunov exponents are reported in table I and II.\n\n\f10\nB.\n\nChaos for small electric fields\n\nNumerical simulations of the model were performed starting with random initial conditions and considering the electric field in the interval [0.002, 0.1], for trajectories of length\nn = 107 . Looking at Figure 7 (left panel) we find more cases with one apparently positive Lyapunov exponent than with two negative exponents. Plotting the last 104 points, in\ntrajectories of length 1.5 \u00d7 108, for the electric fields that produced apparently positive Lyapunov exponents, the situation is pratically the same as for large fields: some cases with one\nexponent that appeared to be positive after 107 collisions eventually produce (after 1.5 \u00d7 108\ncollisions) two negative exponents and a periodic or quasi-periodic steady state [7] [24]. We\nhave further increased the number of collisions up to 3 \u00d7 108 , but the exponent \u03bb1 remained\npositive in most of the cases (Figure 7, right panel) and an apparently chaotic attractor was\nreached.\n\nC.\n\nA small basin of attraction\n\nThe behaviour illustrated above is rather peculiar and calls for some explanation. How\ncan it be that a steady state is so hard to reach in so many cases? Usually, convergence to\nan attracting periodic orbit occurs rather quickly, while doubts remain in some of the cases\nwe considered even after 108 iterations of the bounce map. Therefore, we have investigated\nin greater detail the specific example with \u01eb = 0.087, L = 1.291, sx = 0.7573 and sy = 1.1.\nOne finds that the largest time dependent Lyapunov exponent, \u03bb1 , rapidly settles on a\npositive value, as if the trajectory had reached a chaotic attractor. However, for randomly\nchosen initial conditions, a striking and precise monotonic 1/n behavior sets in for \u03bb1 , after a\ncritical, typically large, time Nc (cf. left panel of Figure 8), as if the trajectory had eventually\ncollapsed on an attracting periodic orbit. Indeed, the asymptotic value of \u03bb1 is \u22120.004838\n\nwith an estimated error not larger than 10\u22126 [25]. The accuracy of this result is due to the\nfact that a sufficiently long simulation approaches an attracting periodic orbit to practically\n\nfull numerical precision; the Lyapunov exponents can then be computed with analogous\naccuracy. This is particularly true in the present example, which turns out to have an\nattracting orbit made of only 19 points, whose initial condition, up to 12 digits accuracy,\nis given by xpo = 0.418447478686, ypo = 0.492193019206, \u03b8po = 0.718794450586, (cf. right\n\n\f11\npanel of Figure 8). For such a small number of points, numerical errors cannot appreciably\naffect the result. In particular, no doubts remain, in this case, about the negative sign of\nboth exponents, hence about the attracting nature of the orbit.\nThe question now arises as to the shape and size of the basin of attraction B of the\nasymptotic periodic orbit, because a particle with random initial conditions wonders around\nalmost all phase space before falling inside this set.\nOur analysis of the evolution of trajectories, with initial condition close to the attracting\nperiodic orbit, shows that B is quite limited in size, and particularly hard to reach because\nit contains a very small region around the right vertex of the rhombus. Furthermore, by\nvarying the initial conditions around (xpo , ypo , \u03b8po ), and computing the Lyapunov exponents,\nthe irregular shape of B is evidenced by the times Nc , which vary most irregularly from O(10)\nto O(108), O(108) being typical for random initial conditions. Nevertheless, the radius of B,\ni.e. the supremum distance between any two points of B, is not smaller than 10\u22124 , which\n\nis quite small but well above the distances which can be accurtely measured with double\nprecision numerical simulations.\nWe conclude that B lies at the border of a chaotic repeller [21], and that it is quite small\nand of irregular shape. Hence, only after a sufficiently long peregrination in phase space,\nwhen the transiently chaotic trajectory gets sufficiently close to B, may numerical errors let\nthe trajectory jump inside B. At this stage, the sudden (exponential) convergence of the\ntrajectory and the consequent 1/n behaviour of the Lyapunov exponents begin.\nThe same qualitative behaviour has been observed for \u01eb =0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006,\n0.007, 0.010, 0.022, 0.040, 0.041, 0.042, 0.043, 0.050, 0.064, 0.065, 0.073, 0.087.\n\nV.\n\nBEHAVIOUR OF THE ATTRACTOR\n\nIt is interesting to understand the behaviuor of the steady state with the field, i.e. to\nbuild a kind of bifurcation diagram, e.g. to compare with the one for the Lorentz gas, whose\nobstacles are defocussing [14]. Our analysis reveals substantial differences from the case of\n[14], as well as from standard low dimensional dynamics.\n\n\f12\nA.\n\nMulti-furcation as function of the electric field\n\nIn order to visualize the behaviour of the attractor as a function of the electric field, we\nconsider a projection of the billiard map phase space: the projection onto the \u03b8 axis, which\nshows a sort of \"multi-furcation\" scenario. When the field is varied, a series of dramatic\nchanges in the dynamics occurs.\nFor the geometry determined by L = 1.291, sx = 0.7573 and sy = 1.1, numerical simulations\nwere performed for a random initial condition, ignoring the initial transient behaviour, for\nthe electric fields in the range [0.01, 1] with a step \u2206\u01eb = 0.01. At the end of a trajectory\nof 107 collisions, the last 103 points were plotted (Figure 9, presents only the upper half\nprojection onto the \u03b8 axis; the other half of this diagram is trivially obtained from this, by\nreflection along the line \u03b8 = 0, as a result of the symmetry imposed on the system by the\nexternal field). In this way, many electric fields are found whose dynamics sample most of\nthe \u03b8 space, while only a few fields show a periodic (or quasi periodic) steady state. The\napparently chaotic regions and the regular regions are finely interspersed with each other,\nin a way which we have not found elsewhere in the literature.\nWe have performed simulations also in the range [1, 1.3] and have only plotted the last\n103 points out of 107 collisions, as in the previous case. In this range, all attractors have\nbeen found to be periodic orbits, which are reached well before 107 collisions. In other\nwords, the stationary state is rapidly reached with large electric fields as expected for the\ncorrespondingly high dissipations.\nHow conclusive are these results? Again, when a periodic steady state is reached, the\nsituation is clear, while doubts remain when the steady state looks chaotic. Therefore we\nhave considered the range [0.77, 0.86]: a rather wide range, apparently chaotic, but also\ncharacterized by high dissipation, which favours ordered dynamics. Running trajectories of\n108 collisions and plotting the last 103 points, the apparently weakly chaotic states survived,\ndespite the high dissipation. This study combined with the analysis of the largest Lyapunov\nexponent makes chaos quite plausible for these fields, although we cannot exclude that the\ntrajectories collapse on periodic orbits after much longer times. On the other hand, there\nis no purpose in pushing further this analysis, since it is bound to remain uncertain. Here,\nit suffices to have uncovered a rather peculiar behaviour, unexpected for simple dynamical\nsystems.\n\n\f13\nIndeed, in our model, the passage from low-period attractors to apparently chaotic steady\nstates, is rather abrupt and seems to be discontinuous. Moreover, the periodic attractors\nalways seem to coexist with transiently chaotic states. Differently, standard bifurcation\nscenarios are characterized by a gradual growth of the period of the attracting orbits, the\norbits are globally attracting and lead to fast convergence of the trajectories towards them.\nTo further investigate this behaviour, we have honed the range [0.77, 0.78] with step 0.001\nsimulating trajectories of 108 collisions, finding a (quasi) periodic orbit at \u01eb = 0.771 and\nanother one at \u01eb = 0.777, with apparently chaotic trajectories in the middle. Thus, we have\nfurther honed the range [0.770; 0.771] with a step of 0.0001, to find that a jump from (quasi)\nperiodic orbits to apparent chaos happens for a field variation of just 10\u22125 .\nWe have also performed simulations in the range [0.771, 0.772], namely from the (quasi)\nperiodic orbit at \u01eb = 0.771 to an apparently chaotic case at \u01eb = 0.772. Plotting the last\n103 points of trajectories of 108 collisions, apparent chaos and (quasi) periodic orbits appear\nagain to be finely intertwined. The range [0.18, 0.38] was similarly studied, and some of\nthe cases that appeared to be chaotic after 107 collisions, turned into (quasi) periodic after\n108 , but not all. Therefore, the duration of the transients results exceedingly long in all\ncases, which is a manifestation of either very small basins of attraction, or of the smallness\nof the stable islands, whose size would then vary wildly with the field. Although this is\nnot conclusive evidence, our analysis supports the idea that there could be a discontinuous\ntransition between chaos and regular motion, in the non-equilibrium Ehrenfest gas.\n\nB.\n\nDependence on the geometry\n\nIn this section we outline the behaviour of the attractors as functions of one of the\nparameters which determine the shape of the billiard: sx . We take two electric fields (one\nlarge and one small) for which we had found apparently chaotic behaviours.\nLet \u01eb = 0.374 be the electric field, L = 1.291 and sy = 1.1; we study the attractor reliance on\nsx \u2208 [0, 1] with step 0.01. We considered trajectories of length 107 collisions and looked at the\n\nlast 103 points. We found a complicated scenario, analogous to the one for the dependence\n\non \u01eb, as sx was varied. In the chosen range, there are more cases with apparently chaotic\nattractors than with (quasi) periodic steady states. Increasing the number of collisions in\neach trajectory up to 5 \u00d7 107 , we find that apparent chaos persists, in other words it seems\n\n\f14\nthat the effect of the electric field prevails on the geometry effects. To analyze more carefully\nthis fact, we have honed the interval [0.09, 0.1] for sx , with step 0.0005 and for trajectories\nof 108 collisions. A sudden transition between apparent chaos and periodic orbits happens\nat sx = 0.099.\nFor \u01eb = 0.014, sx was taken in [0, 1] with step 0.01, for trajectories of length 107 collisions.\nWe found that the situation is slightly different from the small field case. The apparently\nchaotic steady states occupy a smaller region of the phase space than the steady states of\nthe \u01eb = 0.374 case. For instance, the asymptotic state of \u01eb = 0.014 seems to fill almost\ncompletely the space \u03b8, differently from the case of \u01eb = 0.374. Increasing the length of\nthe trajectories up to 5 \u00d7 107 collisions, various apparently chaotic cases reduce to (quasi)\nperiodic orbits, while other survive. Finally, we increased the number of collisions up to 108\n\nfor \u01eb = 0.014 again finding that some apparently chaotic cases turned into quasi periodic\ncases, while other survived.\nWe conclude that the dependence of the attractors on the parameter sx is qualitatively\nsimilar to the dependence on \u01eb, although at times the dependence on \u01eb prevails.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have examined the non equilibrium version of the Ehrenfest gas, which\nis a billiard model with an electric field and a Gaussian thermostat, whose point particle\nmoves in the plane and undergoes elastic collisions with rhomboidal obstacles. The motivation was to understand the dynamics of this nonequilibrium model, whose obstacles have\nflat surfaces, hence do not defocus the trajectories, while its thermostat, which makes dissipative the dynamics, does focus them [26]. We have shown that periodic orbits with one\npositive Lyapunov exponent embedded in what appear to be chaotic attractors, do exist.\nOur numerical results have identified electric fields whose dynamics is strongly suggested\nto be chaotic, although conclusive results are out of reach at present, because of a very\npeculiar phenomena. The stationary state, even if attracting and trivial, requires very long\ntimes to be reached, because it coexists with a transiently chaotic state which covers most\nof the phase space. The dependence on the model parameters of the steady state behaviour\nalso presents peculiar features which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been observed\nbefore: a very irregular, possibly discontinuous dependence of the attracting orbit, and/or\n\n\f15\nof the size and shape of the stable islands, on \u01eb and sx . The peculiarity remains even if it\nis eventually proved that all steady states are periodic, because of their coexistence with\ntransiently chaotic states, and because of the consequent irregular behaviour of the convergence rates. As the sum of the Lyapunov exponents is proportional to the travelled distance,\ncf. Eq.(11), very irregular transport properties are obtained as well, perhaps as irregular as\nthose conjectured for other low-dimensional dynamical systems [22].\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank M.

Indeed, in our case, the\ntotal energy equals the kinetic energy, which is a constant of motion.\n\nFigures\n\nFIG. 1: The modified Ehrenfest gas.

The exponents rapidly converge to one positive and one negative value, which\npersist for very long, up to a number Nc of collisions, dependent on the initial condition. After\nNc , both exponents converge as 1/n to the value \u22120.004838.
