DNA denatures if the entropy gain for unbinding the two strands overcomes\nthe loss of binding energy. When adsorbed to a surface, the entropy gain is smaller than in the\nbulk, leading to a stronger binding and, upon neglecting self-avoidance, absence of a denatured\nphase. Now consider conditions where the binding potentials are too weak for naturation, and the\nsurface potential too weak to adsorb single strands. In a variational approach it is shown that their\ncombined action may lead to a naturated adsorbed phase. Conditions for the absence of naturation\nand adsorption are derived too. The phase diagram is constructed qualitatively.\nPACS numbers: 82.35.Gh, 82.39.Pj, 05.90.+m\n\nThe structure of biopolymers is the key for understanding their biological functioning [1, 2]. A known component of this structure is the double-strand-two polymers\nlined up by hydrogen bonds-realized in DNA and responsible for stability of the genetic information.\nWe shall study the adsorption and surface (adhesion)\ninduced naturation of a double-strand polymer with resolved motion of the separate strands. The adsorption of\nDNA onto surfaces is of interest for a number of applications such as design of substrates as carriers of genetically\nengineered vaccines, surface patterning, histone-DNA interactions, and electrophoresis [3]. DNA adsorption can\nbe realized by different mechanisms [3]: covalent bonding, electrostatic attraction to a positively charged surface [4], hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic forces.\nWhen the two strands are tightly connected to each\nother, the double-strand is described via a single semiflexible chain [5, 6, 7]. Indeed, for the double-stranded\nDNA the corresponding persistence length lp is about 100\nnm [8], or 300 base-pairs. However, this large value of lp\nis more a result of \"construction rigidity\", because for a\nsingle DNA strand lp is much smaller, about 1 nm (2-3\nbase-pairs) [9], while the length of the strand is 10-100\n\u03bcm. The single DNA strand can thus be modeled as a\nflexible chain [5]. Adsorption of a (semi)flexible chain is\nby now a classical problem in polymer physics [2, 5, 6].\nIf the motion of the single strands is resolved, i.e., when\nthe inter-strand hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, the\npolymer becomes a complex system with different, mutually balancing features. A realistic model of DNA should\ninclude stacking energy between two base pairs, the helical structure, self-avoidance, heterogeneity, etc. Such\nmodels do not seem to exist; there are, however, various\nmodels with different degrees of sophistication capturing\nat least some aspects of the problem [2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12].\nOur model deals only with most basic features of the\nproblem. We consider two flexible Gaussian chains interacting with each other and with a plane solid surface.\n\nThough neglecting some features of DNA (see below),\nour model predicts two mechanisms of adhesion induced\nnaturation. This model without surface was mentioned\nin [5] and studied in [10] in the context of DNA denaturation (melting); see also [1, 2, 11, 12] for recent results.\nConsider 2N coupled monomers with radius-vectors\n~r1|k and ~r2|k (k = 1, ..., N ) and potential energy\n(\n\u0015)\nN\n2 \u0014\nX\nX\n\u00012\nl\nU(~rk ) +\n~r\u03b1|k \u2212 ~r\u03b1|k\u22121 + V(~r\u03b1|k )\n,\n2\n\u03b1=1\nk=1\n\nwhere ~rk \u2261 ~r1|k \u2212 ~r2|k , U is the inter-strand potential\nand V is the surface-monomer potential. The harmonic\ninteraction with stiffness l is responsible for the linear\nstructure of the polymers. The system is embedded in\nan equilibrium thermal bath at temperature T = 1/\u03b2\n(kB = 1). The quadratic kinetic energy is irrelevant,\nsince it factorizes from the partition function and does\nnot influence the monomer density. It is known that in\nthe thermodynamical limit N \u226b 1 the free energy of a\nsingle flexible chain (without self-interactions) is determined from an effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation [2, 5]. The\nconsidered two-strand situation is a direct generalization\nof this, with the two-particle equation being H\u03a8 = E\u03a8,\nX2\n1\n[\u2212 \u2202~\u03b12 + V (z\u03b1 )] + U (r), \u2202~\u03b1 \u2261 \u2202~r\u03b1 . (1)\nH\u2261\n\u03b1=1\n2\nHere V \u2261 l\u03b2 2 V, U \u2261 l\u03b2 2 U, while ~r1,2 = (x1,2 , y1,2 , z1,2 )\nare the position vectors of two quantum particles representing the strands and ~r = ~r1 \u2212~r2 is the mutual position.\nWe shall extensively use this quantum language. If there\nis a gap between the lowest two eigenvalues of H, the\nground state wave-function \u03a8 determines the monomer\ndensity as n(r~1 , r~2 ) = \u03a82 (~r1 , ~r2 ). The eigenvalue E is the\nenergy of the quantum pair, related to the free energy F\nof the polymer as E = l\u03b2 2 F/(2N ).\nThe surface is described by an infinite potential wall,\n\u03a8(~r1 , ~r2 ) = 0,\n\nif\n\nz1 \u2264 0,\n\nor z2 \u2264 0.\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nBoth V (z) andRU (r) are attractive,\nR \u221e V \u2264 0, U \u2264 0, and\n\u221e\nshort-ranged: 0 dzV (z) and 0 drr2 U (r) are finite.\nWhen U = 0, the Hamiltonian H reduces to two uncoupled strands (or one-dimensional particles), each in the\npotential V (z). If V (z) is shallow enough, no bound (negative energy) state exists, while the second-order binding\ntransitions corresponds to adsorption of a single flexible\npolymer [2]. The physical order-parameter for this transition is 1/hz 2 i, which is finite (zero) in the adsorbed\n(desorbed) state. Denote by \u03bc the dimensionless coupling constant of V = \u03bcVe such that (for U = 0) the\nadsorption threshold is \u03bcc = 1. Note that the adsorption\nof a single strand DNA is a part of the renaturation via\nhybridization [1], a known method of genetic systematics.\nAnalogously, switching off both V (z) and the wall, we\nshall get a three-dimensional central-symmetric motion\nin the potential U (r) which again is not bound if U is\nshallow. This second-order unbinding transition with the\norder parameter 1/hr2 i corresponds to thermal denaturation (strand separation) of the double-strand polymer\n[1, 10]. Writing likewise U = \u03bb\u0168 , \u03bb is the dimensionless\nnaturation strength. We take the naturation threshold\nin the bulk to be \u03bbc = 1. When the wall is included, i.e.\n(2) is imposed, the strands loose in the adsorbed phase\npart of the entropy needed to denaturate.\nAs seen from Eq.(1), in the (x, y) plane H is both rotationally and translationally symmetric. Thus, for the\nlow energy physicspthe only relevant variable coming from\nthat plane is \u03c1 = (x1 \u2212 x2 )2 + (y1 \u2212 y2 )2 . The relevant\nwavefunction is thus \u03c8(z1 , z2 , \u03c1) and the reduced Hamiltonian Hr reads\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u03c12 + z 2 , (3)\nHr = H1 + H2 \u2212 \u03c1\u22121 \u2202\u03c1 \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 + U\n1\nH1,2 \u2261 \u2212 \u2202z21,2 + V (z1,2 ),\n2\n\nz = z1 \u2212 z2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThere is no hope for an exact solution of this model, since\nit belongs to the class of three-body problems (the role\nof the third particle is being played by the surface; see\nalso below). We shall estimate the lowest energy E0 of\nHr via a variational principle: E0 \u2264 h\u03c7|H|\u03c7i, where \u03c7\nis a normalized trial function. Assume that V (z) (without U ) has a lowest (negative) energy state with normalized wave function \u03c6(z): H1,2 \u03c6(z1,2 ) = EV \u03c6(z1,2 ), with\n\u03c6(z1,2 \u2264 0) = 0. We then make the Ansatz\nZ \u221e\n\u03c7(\u03c1, z1 , z2 ) = \u03c9(z1 , z2 ) \u03be(\u03c1),\nd\u03c1\u03c1\u03be 2 (\u03c1) = 1. (5)\n0\n\nwhere \u03c9(z1 , z2 ) = \u03c6(z1 )\u03c6(z2 ) and where \u03be(\u03c1) is normalized. Varying h\u03c7|H \u2212 E|\u03c7i w.r.t. \u03be(\u03c1), we get an effective\ntwo-dimensional problem: \u2212\u03c1\u22121 \u2202\u03c1 (\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 \u03be) + Ueff (\u03c1)\u03be =\n(E \u2212 2EV )\u03be, where by definition E \u2265 E0 , and where\nUe (\u03c1) is an effective potential:\nZ \u221e\nY2\np\ndz\u03b1 \u03c62 (z\u03b1 ). (6)\nUe (\u03c1) \u2261\nU ( \u03c12 + (z1 \u2212 z2 )2 )\n0\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nLike U , Ue is attractive and short-ranged. It is well\nknown that any (no matter how weak) attractive potential in two dimensions creates a bound state, though the\nlocalization length of this state is exponentially large for\nsmall energies [13]. Thus there is a normalizable function\n\u03be(\u03c1) such that E0 < E < 2EV < 0, i.e., there is an overall\nbound (double-strand and localized next to the surface)\nstate provided V (z) creates a bound state. In the present\nmodel strong enough surface potential prevents denaturation (melting) of the double-strand. Upon taking into\naccount the neglected features (helicity, self-avoidance or\nstacking), the denaturation transition temperature in the\nadsorbed phase is enhanced but (presumably) finite.\nNext to the threshold \u03bcc = 1 of V (z), 2EV \u2261 \u2212\u03ba2 is\nsmall\nand the wave-function is almost flat [13]: \u03c6(z) \u2243\n\u221a\n2\u03ba e\u2212\u03baz . Thus Eq. (6) implies that Ue = O(\u03ba), so\nnaively it predicts absence of binding at the threshold\n\u03ba = 0 of V (z). But let us study the region where V (z)\nalone does not create any bound state, by employing the\ntrial function (5), where now \u03be(\u03c1) is a given normalized\nfunction (its form is irrelevant for us), while \u03c9(z1 , z2 ) is\nfound from the variational equation:\n[ H1 + H2 + Ueff (|z1 \u2212 z2 |) \u2212 E ] \u03c9(z1 , z2 ) = 0, (7)\nZ \u221e\np\nd\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03be 2 (\u03c1) U ( \u03c12 + z 2 ),\nUeff (z) \u2261\n(8)\n0\n\nEquations (7) and (8) describe two one-dimensional pareeff .\nticles interacting via short-range potential Ueff = \u03bbU\nWe shall show that Eq. (7) predicts an overall binding-that is it predicts E < 0 and a localized normalizable wave-function \u03c9(z1 , z2 )-at the threshold \u03ba = 0 of\nthe potential V (z). For a large \u03bb this is expected, since\ntwo strongly coupled particles roughly behave as one with\ndouble mass in a double potential, which decreases the\nthreshold value of V (z) by a factor 4, i.e., \u03bcc (\u221e) = 14 .\nNext we focus on small \u03bb. Though the energy 2EV is\nnearly zero, one can apply an ordinary perturbation expansion in \u03bb, since the suitable matrix elements of Ueff\nappear to be small as well, grace to the small prefactor \u03ba in the zero-order wave-functions |00i \u2261 \u03c6(z1 )\u03c6(z2 ).\nNoting that h00|Ueff |00i = O(\u03ba) for \u03ba \u2192 0 and thus negligible, we get at the second order [13]\nE=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndK\n\n|h00|Ueff |Ki|2\n,\n\u03b5 K + \u03ba2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the integration over the collective variable K\ninvolves all excited wave-functions of the unperturbed\ntwo-particle system with wave-vector K and energy\n\u03b5K . There are three orthogonal families of these states:\n|0ki = \u03c6(z1 )\u03b6k (kz2 ), |k0i = \u03b6k (kz1 )\u03c6(z2 ), |k1 k2 i =\n\u03b6k1 (k1 z1 )\u03b6k2 (k2 z2 ), where \u03b6k (kz) are the corresponding single-particle excited (continuous spectrum) wavefunction of the potential V (z) with the wave-number k.\n\n\f3\n2\n\nFor \u03ba \u2192 0 we get after some steps the finite result\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u00152\nZ \u221e\nE\ndk\n\u22123v\n= \u2212128\ndv e \u03b60 (kv)\n(10)\n\u03b42\n1 + k2\n0\n0\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u00152\nZ \u221e\ndk1 dk2\n\u2212v\ndve\n\u03b6\n(k\nv)\u03b6\n(k\nv)\n,\n\u22122\n0 1\n0 2\n1\n2\n2\n0\n0\n2 + k1 + k2\nwhere \u03b4 \u2261\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\ndu Ueff (u). With \u03b60 (kv) =\n\nq\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nsin(kv) we\n2\n\nget from (10) the numerical value E = \u22120.45 \u03b4 . Its order\nof magnitude can be checked from the exact relation:\nh00|Ueff |\u03c9i = (E \u2212 2EV )h00|\u03c9i,\n\n2EV \u2261 \u2212\u03ba2 .\n\n(11)\n\nAssume that V (z) is close to its threshold (i.e., \u03bc \u2192 1+ ,\nor \u03ba \u2192 0) and that a weakly-bound state exists with\nenergy E = \u2212p2 . Recall that |00i is mainly a constant\nmodulo a numerical factor which cancels from (11). Since\nall potentials in (7) are short-range and thus negligible\nfor large z1 and z2 , we get \u03c9(z1 , z2 ) = f (z1 , z2 )e\u2212p(z1 +z2 ) ,\nwhere f \u2192 1 for z1 , z2 \u2192 \u221e. This is put into (11) and\nfor \u03ba \u2192 0 and small p one gets indeed E \u2243 \u2212\u03b4 2 \u223c \u2212\u03bb2 .\nFor \u03bc < 1 and \u03bb < 1 we are in the situation where neither V (z1 )+V (z2 ) (the attractive wall alone) nor U alone\ncan create a bound state. We thus conclude from (10, 11)\nthat the present approach does predict binding for \u03bc = 1\nand for sufficiently small \u03bb. Since the ground state is\nsupposed to be continuous in \u03bb and \u03bc, the very fact of\nhaving a negative energy at \u03bc = 1 and not very large \u03bb\nimplies that a naturated, adsorbed state will also exist\nfor \u03bcc (\u03bb) < \u03bc < 1, where neither of the potentials V and\nU alone allows binding. The precise curve \u03bcc (\u03bb), where\nthe ground state energy is equal to its value at V = 0\n(adsorption threshold), requires numerical analysis to be\nreported elsewhere [16]. We thus have found an example\nof so called Borromean binding [14], where the involved\npotentials do not produce bound states separately, but\ntheir cumulative effect does so. We see from (5) that this\nunusual binding is connected to correlations between the\nz-components of the particles and (separately) to correlations between their x and y components (in \u03c1).\nNo-binding conditions. To complete the phase diagram, we employ a method suggested in [15]. Let us\nintroduce a third fictive particle with mass M and the\nradius vector ~r3 = (x3 , y3 , z3 ). This particle will substitute the surface: V (z\u03b1 ) (\u03b1 = 1, 2) becomes V (|z\u03b1 \u2212 z3 |),\nand condition (2) is put at z\u03b1 = z3 only. The modified\nproblem with Hamiltonian HM reduces to the original\none when for M \u2192 \u221e, ~r3 becomes a fixed vector which\ncan be chosen at the origin. We have\nHM\n\nX2\n1\n\u2202~ 2\n[ \u2212 \u2202~\u03b12 + V (|z\u03b1 \u2212 z3 |) ].\n= \u2212 3 + U (r) +\n\u03b1=1\n2M\n2\n\nIt is invariant when shifting the radius vectors ~r\u03b1 (\u03b1 =\n1, 2, 3) over any fixed vector, while for a finite-particle\n\n1.5\n\u039b\n\nND\n\nNA\n\n1\n\nb\n0.5\n\nDD\n\nc\na\n\n0.25 0.5 0.75\n\u039c\n\n1\n\n1.25 1.5\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic phase diagram for the inter-strand coupling \u03bb versus the strand-surface coupling \u03bc. The bold lines\nconfine three thermodynamical phases. ND: Naturation and\ndesorption. NA: Naturation and adsorption. DD: Desorption and denaturation. The critical naturation strength in\nthe bulk is \u03bbc = 1, for single strand adsorption it is \u03bcc = 1.\nThe following subregions are confined by normal lines. a: Domain described by the no-binding condition (16). b (bounded\nby the bold DD-NA line and two straight segments): Borromean naturation and adsorption. c: Adsorption and naturation due to overcritical coupling to the surface.\n\nquantum system, a symmetry of HM implies the same\nsymmetry for its ground-state wave-function [13]. Thus,\nX3\n\u2202~\u03b1 \u03a8 = 0.(12)\n\u03a8 = \u03a8(r~1 \u2212 r~2 , r~1 \u2212 r~3 , r~2 \u2212 r~3 ),\n\u03b1=1\n\nWe now decompose HM = H0 + H12 + H13 + H23 , where\n\u0015 X\n\u0014\nX2\n3\n1\nH0 \u2261 \u2212 a\u2202~3 + b\n\u2202~\u03b1 , (13)\n\u2202~l *\n\u03b1=1\nl=1\n2\n!2\nc \u2202~1 \u2212 x\u2202~3\nH13 \u2261 \u2212\n+ V (|z1 \u2212 z3 |), (14)\n2\n1+x\n!2\n\u2202~1 \u2212 \u2202~2\n+ U (|~r1 \u2212 ~r2 |),\n(15)\nH12 \u2261 \u22122d\n2\n\nwhile H23 = H13 (1 \u2192 2). The coefficients a, b, c and d\ncan be read off directly: a = mM \u22121 \u2212 2x2 /(1 + 2x)2 , b =\nd = 2x(1 + x)/(1 + 2x)2 , c = (1 + x)2 /(1 + 2x)2 . Since\nc and d are to be employed as effective masses, for the\nfree parameter x we consider x \u2265 0 (the regime x \u2264 \u22121\nis of no help). Note that h\u03a8|H0 |\u03a8i = 0 due to (12). Let\nus see when h\u03a8|HM |\u03a8i > 0, i.e, when a bound state is\nabsent. Changing the variables-e.g., ~s1 = (1 + x)~r1 ,\n~s3 = (1 + x)~r1 + ~r3 for H13 -we see that h\u03a8|H13 |\u03a8i and\nh\u03a8|H12 |\u03a8i are positive for, respectively, \u03bc \u2264 c(x) and\n\u03bb \u2264 2d(x). There is no binding under these conditions for\nany M including M \u2192 \u221e which returns to the original\nproblem. By varying x from 0 to \u221e, we cover the domain\n0\u2264\u03bc\u2264\n\n\u221a\n1\n(2 \u2212 \u03bb + 2 1 \u2212 \u03bb )\n4\n\n(16)\n\nThis is the no-binding region a shown on Fig. 1. At\n\u03bb = 1 one needs at least \u03bcc = 0.25 to achieve binding,\nwhile at \u03bc = 1, \u03bb = 0+ suffices.\n\n\f4\nAs shown on Fig. 1, there are three phases in the\nmodel: denaturated and desorbed (DD), naturated and\nadsorbed (NA), and naturated and desorbed (ND).\nThe denaturated and adsorbed phase is present only for\nU = 0; recall the discussion below (6). The exact boundary between DD and NA phases has to be convex: if\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bc1 ) and (\u03bb2 , \u03bc2 ) are in DD-i.e., H(\u03bb1 , \u03bc1 ) \u2265 0\nand H(\u03bb2 , \u03bc2 ) \u2265 0-then the entire line joining these\npoints is in DD, because \u03bb and \u03bc enter H linearly:\nH(\u01eb\u03bb1 + (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03bb2 , \u01eb\u03bc1 + (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03bc2 ) \u2265 0, where 1 > \u01eb > 0.\nWe already mentioned that for large \u03bb the adsorption\nof naturated DNA will happen at \u03bcc = 14 due to doubling\nof the mass and potential. For \u03bb approaching \u03bbc = 1\nfrom above, the absorption is weaker and the entropy will\nincrease so we expect that the potential U will facilitate\nadsorption less, leading to the ND-NA curve with \u03bcc >\n1\n4 ; see Fig. 1. At \u03bb = 1 it is expected to meet DD-NA\nat a point, that separates the three phases ND, NA and\nDD. The DD-ND line is implied by the fact that in the\ndesorbed phase the polymer is far from the wall.\nIn conclusion, we modeled the surface adsorption of a\ndouble-stranded DNA. There are several situations where\nthe description of this process via a single chain will not\nbe adequate, and the two-chain modeling is needed. (1)\nThe adsorption realized by the same hydrogen-bonding\nmechanism as the naturation [3]. Then in the vicinity of\nthe (temperature or pH induced) melting transition also\nthe binding to the surface will be small. Thus the motion\nof separate chains will be resolved. (2) The binding to hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., aldehyde-derivate glass) goes via\npartial melting which exposes the hydrophobic core of the\nhelix and leads to the DNA-surface attraction [3]. Both\nnaturation and adsorption are simultaneously weakened\nby increasing the pH [3]. (3) For homogeneous DNA\nat normal conditions (pH= 7 and NaCl concentration of\n0.15 M) the thermal melting occurs at temperatures 67 C\nand 110 C for A-T and C-G unbinding, respectively [1, 2].\nThis temperature can be radically decreased by increasing the pH factor, i.e., by decreasing the concentration of\nfree protons in the solvent, since the negatively charged\nphosphate groups on each strand are not screened any\nmore by protons and strongly repel each other [1]. Due to\nthe same reason, for the DNA adsorption on a positively\ncharged surface [4], the increase of the pH will increase\nthe electrostatic attraction to the surface. Thus weakly\nnaturated and weakly adsorbed states may be produced\nby controlling the pH and the surface charge.\nOur model describes DNA strands as flexible homopolymers. Many features of real DNA are put aside\nin this way: stacking, self-avoidance, helicity, heterogeneity of the base-sequence, dependence of the surfacestrand interaction on the denaturation degree (in the naturated state the bases do not participate in the surfacestrand interaction), etc. However, the model can still\nbe useful in clarifying the mechanisms of DNA adsorption/naturation. We saw that a sufficiently strongly at-\n\ntracting surface prevents thermal denaturation (melting)\nof the double-strand, because effectively the problem reduces to binding in two dimensions, where any attractive\npotential creates a bound state. In practice this implies\nthat in the presence of the surface the melting temperature increases. It was shown that the attractive surface and inter-strand coupling together can create bound\nstates (i.e., double-stranded and adsorbed to the surface),\neven when neither of these interactions alone is capable\nof creating bound states. This unusual type of binding is\nrelated to finely correlated motion of the strands. Such\nBorromean states, where binding is due to the cumulative effect of several potentials, first appeared in nuclear\nphysics [14, 15], but their detection in that field is difficult. Their observation in polymer physics might be\neasier, since the involved scales are mesoscopic. Our results led to the schematic phase diagram which, as we\nargued, may be checked experimentally.\nThanks to Y. Mamasakhlisov for discussions. A. E. A.\nand Zh. S.
