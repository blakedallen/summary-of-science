For example, if only the Josephson coupling energy is considered, and if the self-inductance and mutual\ninductance of the array plaquettes are neglected, the Hamiltonian of a two-dimensional (2D) array of Josephson\njunctions is formally identical to that of a 2D XY model [see, e. g. Ref. 2]. In the presence of such inductive\neffects, this XY description needs to be modified, and several generalizations, which include these effects, have been\nproposed.3,4,5,6 Arrays sometimes appear to mimic behavior seen in nominally homogeneous materials, e. g. high-Tc\nsuperconductors, which often behave as if they are composed of distinct superconducting regions linked together by\nJosephson coupling.7 Finally, the arrays are of potentially practical interest: they may be useful, for example, as\nsources of coherent microwave radiation if the individual junctions can be caused to oscillate in phase in a stable\nmanner.\nRecently, our ability to achieve this kind of stable oscillation, and coherent microwave radiation, was significantly\nadvanced by a series of experiments by Barbara and collaborators.8,9,10,11,12 These workers placed two-dimensional\nunderdamped Josephson arrays in a resonant microwave cavity. The presence of the cavity caused the junctions\nto couple together with remarkable efficiency, resulting in a highly efficient conversion of the injected d. c. power\ninto a. c. radiation. Even more surprising, this efficiency is achieved in underdamped arrays, which according to\nconventional wisdom, should be especially difficult to synchronize, since each such junction is both bistable and\nhysteretic. Numerous workers have attempted to explain these experiments.13,14,15,16\nIn this brief review, we summarize our own model to describe this kind of phase locking.16,17 In Section II, we\npresent the model Hamiltonian. In Section III, we describe the equations of motion resulting from this model, in the\n\"classical limit,\" as defined further below. In Section IV, we give a brief description of the relevant numerical results.\nFinally, in Section V, we present a concluding discussion.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMODEL HAMILTONIAN\n\nWe consider a 2D array of N \u00d7 M superconducting grains placed in a resonant cavity, which we assume supports\nonly a single photon mode of frequency \u03a9. The array thus has (N \u2212 1)(M \u2212 1) square plaquettes. There are a total\nof Nx \u00d7 Ny horizontal junctions, where Nx = N \u2212 1 and Ny = M . A current I is fed into each of the M grains on\nthe left edge of the array, and extracted from each of the M grains on the right edge. Thus, the current is injected in\nthe x direction, with no external current injected in the y direction. A sketch of this geometry is shown in Fig. 1. We\nalso introduce the terminology that a \"row\" of junctions, in this configuration, refers to a group of Ny junctions, all\nwith left-hand end having the same x coordinate, and all being parallel to the bias current. One such row is indicated\nby the dashed lines in Fig. 1.\nWe write the equations of motion for the grain variables (phases and charges). We express our Hamiltonian in the\nform:16,17\nH = Hphoton + HJ + HC + Hcurr + Hdiss .\nHere Hphoton is the energy of the cavity mode, expressed as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2020\nHphoton = ~\u03a9 a a +\n,\n2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a\u2020 and a as the usual photon creation and annihilation operators. HJ is the Josephson coupling energy, which\ntakes the form\nX\nJ\nEij\ncos(\u03b3ij ),\n(3)\nHJ = \u2212\nhiji\n\nJ\nwhere Eij\nis the Josephson energy of the (ij)th junction, and \u03b3ij is the gauge-invariant phase difference across that\nJ\nc\nJ\nc\njunction. Eij\nis related to Iij\n, the critical current of the (ij)th junction, by Eij\n= ~Iij\n/q, where q = 2|e| is the Cooper\npair charge. HC is the capacitive energy of the array, which we write as\n\nHC =\n\n1 X 2 \u22121\nq (C )ij ni nj ,\n2 ij\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C \u22121 is the inverse capacitance matrix, ni is the number of Cooper pairs on the ith grain, and q = 2e is the\ncharge of a Cooper pair (we take e > 0). We write \u03b3ij as\nZ\nA * ds \u2261 \u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j \u2212 Aij ,\n(5)\n\u03b3ij = \u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j \u2212 [(2\u03c0)/\u03a60 ]\nij\n\nwhere \u03c6i is the gauge-dependent phase of the superconducting order parameter on grain i, \u03a60 = hc/(2e) is the flux\nquantum, and A is the vector potential, which in Gaussian units takes the form18,19\np\n\u0001\n(6)\nA(x, t) = (hc2 )/(\u03a9) a(t) + a\u2020 (t) E(x),\nR 3\nwhere E(x) is a vector proportional to the local electric field of the mode, normalized such that V d x|E(x)|2 = 1.\nAgain, \u03a9 is the resonant frequency of the cavity mode, and V is the cavity volume. The line integral is taken across\nthe (ij)th junction. The phase factor Aij is then\nAij = gij (a + a\u2020 ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\ngij =\n\ns\n\n~c2 (2\u03c0)3\n\u03a9 \u03a620\n\nZ\n\nE * ds\n\n(8)\n\nij\n\ncharacterizes the effective coupling between the (ij)th junction and the cavity.\nOne can also define a frustration f\u03bc for the \u03bcth plaquette by the relation\nf\u03bc =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nX\n\nplaquette\n\nAij ,\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nwhere the sum runs over the bonds in the \u03bcth plaquette. For the present case,\nf\u03bc = f\u03bccavity =\n\n1\n(a + a\u2020 )\n2\u03c0\n\nX\n\ngij .\n\n(10)\n\nplaquette\n\nIf there were an applied magnetic field normal to the array in addition to the cavity electric field, then the frustration\nwould have an additional contribution\nf\u03bcmag = \u03a6\u03bc /\u03a60 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u03bc is the magnetic flux through the \u03bcth plaquette.20\nNote that gij is very sensitive to the experimental geometry. For example, if the cavity has the form of a parallelepiped with edges\nLx , Ly , and Lz , where Lz \u2265 Lx \u2265 Ly , then lowest mode in this cavity is a TE mode with\nq\nfrequency \u03a9 = \u03c0c\n\n1/L2z + 1/L2y ; the corresponding value of gij is given by17\n2\ngij\n= e2ij\n\ns2\n32e2\np\n,\n~c Ly L2x + L2z\n\n(12)\n\nwhere eij is the cosine of the angle between the E of the resonant mode and the vector ds). In the geometry of Ref.\n8, \u03a9/(2\u03c0) \u2248 100 GHz, a cavity of this shape gives rise to gij \u223c 0.001,17 though it is obviously very sensitive to both\narray and cavity geometry.\nThe driving current and dissipation may be incorporated as follows:16,17 The driving current is included via a\n\"washboard potential,\" Hcurr , of the form\nHcurr = \u2212\n\n~I ext X\n\u03b3ij ,\nq\n\n(13)\n\nhijikx\u0302\n\nwhere I is the driving current injected in the x direction into each grain on the left edge and extracted from the\nright edge, the sum running over bonds in the x direction.

These satisfy the\ncommutation relation [aR , aI ] = i/2, which follows from [a, a\u2020 ] = 1. In terms of these variables, Hphoton = ~\u03a9(a2R +a2I )\nand \u03b3ij = \u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j \u2212 2gij aR .\n\n\f4\nThe time-dependence of the various operators appearing in the Hamiltonian (1) is now obtained from the Heisenberg\nequations of motion. These are readily derived from the commutation relations for the various operators in the\nHamiltonian (1). Besides the relations already given, the only non-zero commutators are [nj , \u03c6k ] = \u2212i\u03b4jk and\n[p\u03b1,ij , u\u03b2,kl ] = \u2212i~ \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 \u03b4ij,kl , where the last delta function vanishes unless (ij) and (kl) refer to the same junction.\nUsing all these relations, we find, after a little algebra, the following equations of motion for the operators \u03c6i , ni ,\naR , and aI :\n\u03c6\u0307i =\n\nq 2 X \u22121\n(C )ij nj ,\n~ j\n\n(17)\n\n1X J\nEil sin(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6l \u2212 2gil aR )\n~\nl\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 XX\nI ext\n(f\u03b1,il )2\n(\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n2g\na\n)\n,\n+ i \u2212\nu\u03b1,il f\u03b1,il +\ni\nl\nil R\nq\n~\nm\u03b1,il (\u03c9\u03b1,il )2\n\u03b1\n\n\u1e45i = \u2212\n\n(18)\n\nl\n\n\u0227R = \u03a9 aI ,\n\n\u0227I = \u2212\u03a9 aR +\n\nX\n\ngij\n\nJ\nEij\n\n~\n\nsin(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j \u2212 2gij aR ) \u2212\n\nhiji\n\n+\n\nX gij X\n~\n\nhiji\n\nf\u03b1,ij u\u03b1,ij\n\n\u03b1\n\nI\n\next\n\nq\n\nX\n\n(19)\n\ngij\n\nhijikx\u0302\n\n!\n(f\u03b1,ij )2\n+\n(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j \u2212 2gij aR ) .\n2\nm\u03b1,ij \u03c9\u03b1,ij\n\n(20)\n\nHere, the index l ranges over the nearest-neighbor grains of i. In writing these equations, we have assumed that the\nonly external currents Iiext are those along the left and right edges of the array, where they are \u00b1I ext [cf. Fig. 1].\nEqs. (17)-(20) are equations of motion for the operators aR , aI , nj , and \u03c6j (or \u03b3j ). In order to make these equations\namenable to computation, we will regard these operators as c-numbers. This should be reasonable when there are\nmany photons in the cavity.16,17\nThe equations of motion for the harmonic oscillator variables can also be written out explicitly, but are of no\ninterest; we instead eliminate those variables and incorporate a dissipative term directly into the equations of motion\nfor the other variables. Such a replacement is possible provided that the spectral density of each junction is linear\nin frequency, as above. In that case,16,21,22,23,24 the oscillator variables\ncan be integrated out.\n\u0011 The effect of carrying\nP \u0010\n(f\u03b1,ij )2\n~ R0\nout this procedure is that one should make the replacement \u03b1 f\u03b1,ij u\u03b1,ij + m\u03b1,ij\n\u03b3\n2\nij \u2192 2\u03c0 Rij \u03b3\u0307ij wherever\n\u03c9\u03b1,ij\nthis sum appears in the equations of motion. Making this replacement in the equations of motion and simplifying,\nwe obtain the equations of motion for nj and aI with damping:\n\u1e45i = \u2212\n\nJ\nX Eij\nj\n\n~\n\n\u0227I = \u2212\u03a9 aR +\n\nsin(\u03b3ij ) +\nX\nhiji\n\ngij\n\nIiext X 1 R0\n\u03b3\u0307ij ,\n\u2212\nq\n2\u03c0 Rij\nj\n\n(21)\n\nX\nEij\nR0\nI ext X\ngij\ngij +\n\u03b3\u0307ij .\nsin(\u03b3ij ) \u2212\n~\nq\n2\u03c0Rij\nhijikx\u0302\n\n(22)\n\nhiji\n\nOnce, again, the index j is summed only over the nearest-neighbor grains of i. Equations (17), (19), (21), and (22)\nform a closed set of equations which can be solved for the time-dependent functions \u03b3i , ni , aR and aI , given the\nexternal current and the other parameters.\nTo express these equations of motion in terms of suitable scaled variables, we introduce a dimensionless time\nc\n\u03c4 = tqRI c /~ = \u03c9\u03c4 t, where R and I c are suitable averages over Rij and Iij\n. We also define the other scaled\nq\nq\nRij\nVi\nR0\nR\n\u03a9\nI\n \u0303\nvariables R\u0303ij = R , \u03a9\u0303 = \u03c9\u03c4 , I = I c , \u1e7ci = RI c , \u00e3R,I = 2\u03c0 R0 aR,I , g\u0303ij =\n2\u03c0R gij , C\u0303ij = \u03c9\u03c4 RCij . The last\n\nrelation involves the capacitance matrix Cij . We assume that this takes the form25,26 Cij = (Cd + zi Cc ) \u03b4ij \u2212\nCc (\u03b4i,j+x\u0302 + \u03b4i,j\u2212x\u0302 + \u03b4i,j+\u0177 + \u03b4i,j\u2212\u0177 ), i. e., that there is a non-vanishing capacitance only between neighboring grains\nand between a grain and ground. Here zi (= 4) is the number of nearest neighbors of grain i, Cd and Cc are respectively\nthe diagonal (self) and nearest-neighbor capacitances, and x\u0302 and \u0177 are unit vectors in the x and y directions. The\ncorresponding Stewart-McCumber parameters are \u03b2c =\nP\u03c9\u03c4 RCc and \u03b2d = \u03c9\u03c4 RCd .\nIn the above equations, we have introduced Vi = q j (C \u22121 )ij nj , which is the potential on site i. The integral of\nthe electric field across junction (ij) is Vij = Vi \u2212 Vj \u2212 2g\u0303ij \u03a9aI .\nCarrying out these variable changes, and after some algebra, we find the dimensionless equations of motion\n\u03c6\u0307i = \u1e7ci ,\n\n(23)\n\n\f5\n\"\n!#\nX\nX\n1\n \u0307\next\n\u22121\nc\n \u0303\n \u0303\n(C\u0303 )ij Ij \u2212\nIjl sin(\u03c6j \u2212 \u03c6l \u2212 2g\u0303jl aR ) +\n(\u1e7ci \u2212 \u1e7cl \u2212 2g\u0303il \u03a9\u0303\u00e3I ) ,\n\u1e7c i =\nR\u0303jl\nj\nl\n\n(24)\n\n\u00e3 \u0307 R = \u03a9\u0303\u00e3I ,\n\n(25)\n\nand\n\u00e3 \u0307 I = \u2212\u03a9\u0303\u00e3R +\n\nX\nhiji\n\n\"\n\nc\ng\u0303ij I \u0303ij\n\n#\nX\n1\ng\u0303ij ,\n(\u1e7ci \u2212 \u1e7cj \u2212 2\u03a9\u0303g\u0303ij \u00e3I ) \u2212 I \u0303ext\nsin(\u03c6i \u2212\u03c6j \u22122g\u0303ij \u00e3R ) +\nR\u0303ij\nhijikx\u0302\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the dot refers to a derivative with respect to \u03c4 . These equations do not include the self-magnetic fields produced\nby the currents.3,4,5,6 However, they can be generalized to include external currents with both x and y components,\nand non-square primitive cells. Also, note that the frustration parameter defined earlier is now time-dependent.\nIV.\n\nSOME NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nWe now describe some numerical results obtained by solving Eqs. (23) - (26) numerically,17 using the adaptive\nBulrisch-Stoer method27 as further described in Ref. 16. For simplicity the coupling constants g\u0303ij were assumed to\nhave only two possible values, g\u0303x and g\u0303y , corresponding to junctions in the x and y direction respectively. This\nassumption should be reasonable if there is little disorder and the resonant mode has long wavelength compared to\nthe array dimensions.\nThe calculated IV characteristics for the case g\u0303x 6= 0, g\u0303y = 0, with driving current parallel to the x axis are shown\nin Fig. 2. The array is taken to have 10 \u00d7 4 grains, with capacitances \u03b2c = 20 and \u03b2d = 0.05 (independent of junction),\nc\ng\u0303x = 0.012, and \u03a9\u0303 = 0.41. The critical current through the (ij)th junction is I \u0303ij\n= 1 + \u2206ij where the disorder \u2206ij\nc\nR\u0303ij is assumed to be\nis randomly selected with uniform probability from [\u2212\u2206, \u2206], and \u2206 = 0.05. The product I \u0303ij\n28\nthe same for all junctions, in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff expression. The calculated IV's are shown\nas a series of points. The arrow directions of the arrows indicate whether the curves were obtained under increasing\nor decreasing current drive, or both. The horizontal dashed curves are voltages where self-induced resonant steps\n(SIRS's) are expected, namely hV i\u03c4 /(N RIc ) = \u03a9\u0303, where hV i\u03c4 is the time-averaged voltage (dotted lines are guides\nto the eye). Each nearly horizontal series of points denotes a calculated IV characteristic for a different number of\nactive rows Na , and represents Na \u00d7 Ny (horizontal) junctions sitting on the first integer (n = 1) SIRS. The calculated\nvoltages agree well with expected values given by dashed horizontal lines. The long straight diagonal line segment\nrepresents the ohmic part of the IV characteristic with all rows active. (The corresponding segments for other choices\nof Na < 10 are not shown). Besides the integer SIRS's, there are a few fractional SIRS's, similar to what is seen for\nShapiro steps in conventional underdamped junctions.29\nFig. 3 shows the IV characteristics for three different arrays, each with all rows in the active state: (i) a 40 \u00d7 1 (full\ncurve), (ii) a 40 \u00d7 2 (dotted curve) and (iii) a 40 \u00d7 3 (long-dashed curve). Each array has the parameters g\u0303x = 0.015,\n\u03a9\u0303 = 0.49, \u03b2c = 20, \u03b2d = 0.05 and \u2206 = 0.05. Once again, the arrows denote the directions of current sweep. The\nhorizontal dot-dashed curve shows the expected position of the SIRS corresponding to Na = 40 [V /(Nx RIc ) = \u03a9\u0303].\nThe curves show that all three arrays have qualitatively similar behavior. First, if the array is started from a random\ninitial phase configuration, such that I \u0303 \u2261 I/Ic > 1 + \u2206, and I \u0303 is decreased, then all the rows lock on to the Na = 40\nSIRS. Secondly, if I \u0303 is further decreased, the Na = 40 active state eventually becomes unstable and all the junctions\ngo into their superconducting states. Finally, if I \u0303 is increased starting from a state in which the array is on the\nNa = 40 SIRS, the SIRS remains stable until I \u0303 reaches the critical current for the various rows, and the IV curve\nbecomes ohmic.\nIn Fig. 4, we plot the time-averaged energy \u1ebc(Na ) = h\u00e32R + \u00e32I i\u03c4 in the cavity for three different arrays: 40 \u00d7 1\n(stars), 40 \u00d7 2 (circles), and 40 \u00d7 3 (squares). In all cases, I \u0303 = 0.58, and the other parameters are the same as those\nof Fig. 3. Below a threshold value of Na , (which we denote Nc and which depends on Ny ), the active rows are in\nthe McCumber state (not on the SIRS's). In this case, \u1ebc(Na ) is small and shows no obvious functional dependence\non Na (see inset). By contrast, above threshold, \u1ebc(Na ) is much larger and increases as Na2 . Fig. 4 shows that, when\nNy is increased at fixed g\u0303x , Nc decreases. Precisely this same trend is observed when we increase g\u0303x while holding\nNy fixed (and was observed in our previous 1D calculations with increasing g\u0303x ). Thus, the relevant parameter in\nunderstanding the threshold behavior appears to be Ny g\u0303x .\n\n\f6\nFor the 2D arrays, one can introduce a define a Kuramoto order parameter hrh i\u03c4 for the horizontal bonds by\nhrh i\u03c4 =\n\nX\n1\nei\u03b3ij |i\u03c4 ,\nh|\nNa Ny\n\n(27)\n\nhijikx\u0302\n\nwhere Na is the number of active rows, Ny is the number of horizontal junctions in a single row and the sum runs\nover all the active, horizontal junctions. For the parameters shown in Fig. 4, it is found,17 as in 1D,16 that hrh i\u03c4 \u223c 1\nfor Na > Nc while hrh i\u03c4 \u226a 1 for Na < Nc . This behavior occurs because, for this choice of parameters, none of the\nactive junctions are on a SIRS when Na < Nc .\nFor the case g\u0303x = 0, g\u0303y 6= 0, in our geometry (with square primitive cells), we have not been able to find any value\nfor g\u0303y for which a SIRS develops. This behavior is easily understood. In this geometry, with current applied in the x\ndirection, there is little power dissipated in the vertical junctions and no resonance is induced in the cavity.\nIt is no surprise that the cavity interacts only very weakly with the vertical junctions. From previous studies of both\nunderdamped and overdamped disordered Josephson arrays in a rectangular geometry (see, e. g., Refs. 30, and 31),\nit is known that when current is applied in the x direction, the y junctions remain superconducting, with hV i\u03c4 \u2248 0,\nwhile the x junctions comprising an active row are almost perfectly synchronized, with hrx i \u2248 1.\nIf there were an an external magnetic field perpendicular to the array, we believe that SIRS's would be generated for\ng\u0303y 6= 0, even if g\u0303x = 0. In this case, as mentioned earlier, there would be a non-zero magnetic-field-induced frustration\nf\u03bcmag [Eq. (11)]. As a result of this magnetic-field-induced frustration, there would be nonzero voltages across the y\njunctions, as well as supercurrents in these junctions.\nIt is of interest to compare these 2D results explicitly with those of 1D arrays. In Fig. 5, the IV characteristics\nof a 10 \u00d7 1 array having coupling constant g\u0303x;10\u00d71 = 0.0259 with those of a 10 \u00d7 10 array with coupling constant\ng\u0303x;10\u00d710 = 0.00259. The other parameters are the same for the two arrays: \u03a9\u0303 = 0.41, \u03b2c = 20, \u03b2d = 0.05 and\n\u2206 = 0.05. The expected positions of the SIRS's [at V /(N RIc ) = \u03a9\u0303] are indicated by dashed horizontal lines. Indeed,\nthe two sets of IV characteristics are very similar. This indicates that the crucial parameter is Ny g\u0303x , not Ny and g\u0303x\nindependently. The slight extra flatness in the 10 \u00d7 10 IV's probably occurs because the individual junction couplings\nin the 10 \u00d7 1 array are 10 times larger than those in the 10 \u00d7 10 array. Similarly, the differences in the \"retrapping\ncurrent\" in the two sets of curves (i. e. the current values below which the McCumber curve becomes unstable), are\ndue to the fact that, for a given value of \u2206, the 2D arrays are effectively less disordered than the 1D arrays, since the\naverage critical current for a single row has a smaller rms spread than the critical current of a single junction in a 1D\narray. (For other discussions of the effects of disorder, see, e. g., Refs. 32,33,34).\nIn both the 10 \u00d7 10 and the 10 \u00d7 1 array of Fig. 5, the width of the SIRS's varies similarly (and non-monotonically)\nwith the number of active rows. This behavior distinguishes our predictions from those of some other models,13,14\nwhere a monotonic dependence of SIRS width on Na is found,9 and the cavity is modeled as an RLC oscillator\nconnected in parallel to the entire array.\nIn Fig. 6, the reduced time-averaged cavity energy \u1ebc = ha2R + a2I i\u03c4 is plotted vs. I \u0303 = I/Ic for both arrays of Fig.\n5, under conditions such that all rows are active. This plot is obtained by following the decreasing current branch.\nWhen the 10 \u00d7 10 array (with g\u0303(10\u00d710) = 0.1 g\u0303(10\u00d71) ) locks on to the SIRS, \u1ebc jumps to a value which is approximately\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than in the 10 \u00d7 1 array, even though Ny g\u0303x is the same for both arrays. The reason\nis that though the width of the steps is controlled primarily by Ny g\u0303x , the energy in the cavity is determined by the\nsquare of the number of radiating junctions, which is is 100 times larger for the 2D than the 1D array.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nThe equations of motion described lead to a transition from incoherence to coherence, as a function of the number\nof active rows Na . There is also a striking effect of polarization: the transition to coherence occurs only when the\ncavity mode is polarized so that its electric field has a component parallel to the direction of the current flow.\nThe numerical results closely resemble the experimental behavior,8,11 showing the following experimental features:\n(i) self-induced resonant steps (SIRS's) in the IV characteristics; (ii) a transition from incoherence to coherence above\na threshold number of active junctions; and (iii) a total energy in the cavity which varies quadratically with the\nnumber of active junctions when those junctions are locked onto SIRS's. But there may be some differences, as\ndiscussed further in Ref. 17.\nThe 2D theory bears many similarities to the 1D case and elucidates why the 1D model works so well. These\nsimilarities occur because, in a square array, only junctions which are parallel to the applied current couple to the\ncavity. Thus, as in 1D, the 2D model leads to clearly defined SIRS's with voltages proportional to the cavity resonant\nfrequency. However, there are some numerical results specific to 2D. For example, whenever one junction in a given\n\n\f7\nrow is biased on a SIRS, all the junctions in that row phase-lock onto that same SIRS. In addition, when the array\nis biased on a SIRS, \u1ebc(Na ) is much larger in 2D than in 1D, for the same value of the coupling parameter g\u0303x Ny .\nA key difference between 1D and 2D is the effect of polarization: when the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to\nthe applied current, it does not affect the array IV characteristics. We believe that, if the array were frustrated, e. g.\nby an external magnetic field normal to the plane of the array, there would be a coupling even when the cavity mode\nis polarized perpendicular to the current. It would be of interest to carry out calculations for the model described\nhere, to confirm this effect.\nWe conclude with a brief discussion of ways in which our model might be generalized to include some effects which\nare presently not taken into account. First, of course, one should include the fact that the cavity, as well as the\njunctions, has a finite damping (finite Q). Second, the real cavity fields are not spatially uniform within the array,\nas assumed in the calculations presented here. We speculate that the effect of these two generalizations would be\nto inhibit the array synchronization. Third, all real cavities have more than one resonant mode; these other modes\nmay be relevant in some experimental circumstances. Fourth, we have treated the operators as c-numbers, i. e., have\nneglected quantum effects related to their non-commutativity. These quantum effects will certainly be relevant in\nsome circumstances. Finally, the present treatment of damping within individual Josephson junctions is also carried\nout in the classical limit (resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction); in the quantum regime where the\nindividual junction variables need to be treated quantum-mechanically, this treatment will need to be modified.\nMost of these generalizations can probably be carried out in a straightforward manner. Thus, we believe that the\npresent model has most of the essential physics underlying the SIRS's seen in experiments. Of the omitted effects, we\nbelieve that the quantum effects, if included, are most likely to produce qualitative changes, because they could lead\nto intriguing entanglement between quantum states of the array and of the cavity.35\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the National Science Foundation, through grant DMR01-04987, and in part by\nthe U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.

There are (M \u00d7 N ) superconducting islands (black squares), making\n[(M \u2212 1) \u00d7 N + (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 M ] Josephson junctions (crosses). An external current I ext is injected into each junction at one end of\nthe array and extracted from each junction at the other end. The array is placed in an electromagnetic cavity which supports\na single resonant photon mode of frequency \u03a9. The dashes denote a \"row\" of junctions, which is perpendicular to the current\nbias and is comprised of horizontal junctions.\n\n\f10\n\nVoltage V/(NxRIc)\n\n1.0\n\nV/(NxRIc)\nn'th voltage step\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nCurrent I/Ic\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 2: Calculated current-voltage characteristic for a 10 \u00d7 4 array with cavity frequency \u03a9\u0303 = 0.41, capacitance parameters\n\u03b2c = 20 and \u03b2d = 0.05, disorder parameter \u2206 = 0.05 and junction-cavity coupling in the horizontal direction g\u0303x = 0.012.\nThe horizontal dashed lines show expected voltages for the various SIRS's.

The horizontal dot-dashed line shows the expected\nSIRS position. Note that as the array width increases, the smallest I \u0303 at which all the active junctions phase-lock on the SIRS\nalso increases.
