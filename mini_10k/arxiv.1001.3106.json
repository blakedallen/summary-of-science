Friedlander and Lawson in [FL92]. On one hand this theory has a very geometric definition,\nand on the other it is strongly related to the abstractly defined motivic cohomology theory.\nIn this paper, we define, along the lines of [Fri00], a modification of morphic cohomology in\norder to have Mayer-Vietoris and homotopy invariance properties of the theory for all quasiprojective varieties (not only smooth). Then, we use those properties to construct a spectral\nsequence computing the morphic cohomology of a toric variety in terms of its combinatorial\ndata.\nIn section 2 we recall the definition of morphic cohomology and the theorems we need, and\ndefine the modification of the theory we will use. This is mainly an expository section except,\nmaybe, subsection 2.3.\nIn section 3 we recall the definition of toric variety, and the constructions we will use, mainly to\nset up the notation. We also write down an explicit computation of the morphic cohomology\nof algebraic tori.\nFinally, in section 4 we build a resolution of the constant sheaf ZX on a toric variety in terms\nof the combinatorial data. This resolution allows us to construct a spectral sequence (theorem\n4.21) computing the hypercohomology of a complex of sheaves F \u2217 on the toric variety X(\u2206) in\nterms of the combinatorial data and the value of this hypercohomology on algebraic tori. Then\nwe specialize this to the case of morphic cohomology, giving a very explicit spectral sequence\nconverging to the morphic cohomology of X(\u2206) and whose second page involves only combinatorial data. Moreover, we prove its rational degeneration (theorem 4.23). Finally, we also\nuse the spectral sequence to extend the Suslin conjecture, proved in [FHW04] and [Voi08b] for\nsmooth linear varieties, to all toric varieties, even singular ones.\nI want to express my gratitude to my advisor, Pere Pascual, for his help and encouragement\nduring this work, and also to Eric Friedlander and Mircea Voineagu, from whom I learnt a\nlot during the time I spent in Los Angeles.\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\nIn this section we recall some facts about morphic cohomology. Let Y be a projective variety\nover C, with a fixed projective embedding. It is a classical fact (see chapter 1 in [Kol96]) that\nthe set of effective k-cycles on Y has the structure of an algebraic variety. This variety is called\nthe Chow variety, and we will denote it by C(Y, k). It may have infinitely many connected\ncomponents, corresponding to the homology classes of the cycles. The Chow variety has a natural operation given by the sum of cycles. This operation is algebraic, so C(Y, k) is a monoid\nin the category ProjC of projective varieties (see [Fri91]).\n\n\f3\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nSet theoretically, the group of algebraic k-cycles on Y is the group completion of the Chow\nvariety,\nZ(Y, k) = C(Y, k)+ = C(Y, k) \u00d7 C(Y, k)/C(Y, k).\n(1)\nThis can be used to induce a topology on Z(Y, k) from the analytic topology on the Chow\nvariety. As shown in [Law89] and [Fri91], this topology on Z(Y, k) does not depend on\nthe projective embbeding of Y . Moreover, its homotopy type is a very interesting invariant\ncontaining information about the geometry of Y . The homotopy groups of this space Z(Y, k)\nare called the Lawson homology groups of Y , and are denoted by Lk Hn (Y ). The usual indexing\nconvention is as follows,\nLk Hn (Y ) = \u03c0n\u22122k Z(Y, k).\n(2)\nThe construction of the Chow varieties C(Y, k) works only for projective Y , but the topology\non Z(Y, k) can be defined for quasi-projective varieties (see [LF92]). Take Y \u2282 Y a projective\nclosure of the quasi-projective variety Y , and let Y \u221e = Y r Y , which is again projective.\nThen we define the topology in Z(Y, k) as the quotient topology given by the set-theoretic\nidentification\n(3)\nZ(Y, k) = Z(Y , k)/Z(Y \u221e , k).\nTheorem 4.3 in [LF92] states that the topology on Z(Y, k) we have just described does not\ndepend on the choice of projective closure Y .\nIt will be useful to work simplicially, so we denote the singular simplicial set associated to\nZ(Y, k) by\nZ\u2022 (Y, k) = Sing\u2022 Z(Y, k).\nThe group law on Z(Y, k) makes Z\u2022 (Y, k) into a simplicial abelian group.\nOne important fact about those spaces of cycles is that the homotopy groups of the spaces\nof 0-cycles coincide with the Borel-Moore homology groups of Y (singular homology if Y is\nprojective),\n\u03c0l Z(Y, 0) \u2243 HlBM (Y, Z).\n(4)\nThis is a consequence of a classical result of Dold and Thom [DT58]. From this we see that\nthe space of cycles Z(Aq , 0) has only nontrivial homotopy groups in dimension 2q, so it is an\nalgebraic model of an Eilenberg-Maclane space K(Z, 2q).\nThis interpretation motivates the construction of a cohomological theory related to the Lawson\nhomology groups, morphic cohomology, in the same way singular cohomology is related to\nsingular homology. The inspiration for constructing morphic cohomology comes from the fact\nthat singular cohomology can be interpreted as homotopy groups of spaces of continuous maps\nto an Eilenberg-Maclane space,\nH 2q\u2212l (X, Z) \u2243 \u03c0l Map(X, K(Z, 2q)).\n\n(5)\n\nThen one could think of the homotopy groups of spaces of \"algebraic maps\" from an algebraic\nvariety X to our algebraic model of K(Z, 2q), the space of 0-cycles Z(Aq , 0). This is roughly\n\n\f2 Morphic cohomology\n\n4\n\nthe idea behind the construction of morphic cohomology, as we will recall in section 2.2. But\nbefore this, it will be convenient to talk about a more general bivariant theory depending on\ntwo algebraic varieties, X and Y .\n\n2.1 Bivariant Morphic spaces\nWe are going to describe a bivariant theory, following [Fri98]. This theory depends on two\nalgebraic varieties X and Y , and roughly speaking, is defined as the homotopy groups of\nspaces of \"algebraic maps\" from X to a space of cycles Z(Y, k). The first thing to do is to\nmake precise what we mean by \"algebraic maps\". For technical reasons, it happens to be more\nconvenient to allow a slightly more general class of maps than the usual algebraic morphisms\nof varieties.\nDefinition 2.1. A continuous algebraic map between two algebraic varieties X and Y is a\n\u25ee\n\u2192 Y which is defined at every point and is continuous. We will denote\nrational map f : X 99K\nby Mor(X, Y ) the set of continuous algebraic maps.\nRemark 2.2. If X is a normal variety, a continuous algebraic map f : X \u2192 Y is a morphism.\nThis is a consequence of Zariski's main theorem applied to the projection \u0393f \u2192 X of the\ngraph of the map to X.\nIn particular, this means that the technical point involving continuous algebraic maps appears\nonly for non-normal varieties.\nFor more details on the role of continuous algebraic maps see [Fri00] section 1 and [FW01].\nWe want to topologize the spaces Mor(X, Y ). The first choice of topology would be the\ncompact-open topology, however it is not the right one. Its problems come from two different\nsources: one appears when X is non-complete, and the other when X is non-normal. Here\nwe just describe the correct topology we need, and for the justification of why this seems to\nbe the right choice we refer to [FL97] appendix C (for the case in which X is normal) and\n[Fri00] proposition 1.4 for the general case.\nDefinition 2.3. Let X be a quasi-projective variety and Y a projective one.\nWhen X is normal, we provide the space Mor(X, Y ) of continuous algebraic maps with a\ntopology such that a sequence of maps {fn } converges to f \u2208 Mor(X, Y ) if, and only if\n1. it converges for the compact-open topology,\n2. there is a compactification X \u2282 X for which the sequence of closures of graphs \u0393fn \u2282\nX \u00d7 Y has bounded degree.\nWhen X is not normal, we provide the space Mor(X, Y ) with the topology induced as a\nsubspace of Mor(X\u0303, Y ), where X\u0303 \u2192 X is the normalization of X.\n\n\f5\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nRemark 2.4. In the case in which X is projective and normal, the condition on the boundedness of the degree becomes void, and then the topology on Mor(X, Y ) coincides with the\ncompact-open topology.\nThere is one last technical point we must deal with. In the situation in which we are interested,\nMor(X, Z(Y, k)), the second argument is the space of cycles Z(Y, k) which is not an algebraic\nvariety. But it is the group completion of the Chow variety C(Y, k), so we can consider\ninstead the well defined space Mor(X, C(Y, k))+ where (-)+ denotes a group completion as in\n(1).\nMoreover, if Y is quasi-projective, we can perform a similar trick as for Z(Y, k), but on the\nwhole Mor(X, C(Y, k))+ . We chose a projective embedding for Y , and take the projective closure Y , with closed complement Y \u221e . In this case though, the bivariant theory will depend on\nthe pair (Y , Y \u221e ), not only on Y . Finally, as it will be convenient to work simplicially, we take\nsingular chains. This is the content of the following definition.\nDefinition 2.5. Let X be quasi-projective variety and Y a projective one. Then, the bivariant\nmorphic space M\u2022 (X, Y, k) is the simplicial abelian group\nM\u2022 (X, Y, k) = (Sing\u2022 Mor(X, C(Y, k)))+ ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the group completion (-)+ here means a levelwise group-completion of the simplicial\nabelian monoid.\nIf Y is quasi-projective, with projective closure Y and closed complement Y \u221e , Then the\nbivariant morphic space is the quotient simplicial abelian group\nM\u2022 (X, Y /Y \u221e , k) = M\u2022 (X, Y , k)/M\u2022 (X, Y \u221e , k).\n\n(7)\n\nRemark 2.6. The construction of this morphic space is contravariantly functorial in X, by\ncomposition. It is also covariantly functorial for proper morphisms of the pair (Y , Y \u221e ). That\n\u2032\n\u2032\nis, if Y \u2192 Y is a proper morphism sending Y \u221e to Y \u2032\u221e , the induced map C(Y , k) \u2192 C(Y , k)\nsends the cycles in C(Y \u221e , k) to C(Y \u2032\u221e , k) so we get a continuous map\nM\u2022 (X, Y /Y \u221e , k)\n\n// M (X, Y \u2032 /Y \u2032\u221e , k).\n\u2022\n\nThose spaces have a localization propery with respect to the second argument analogous to\nproposition 3.2 in [LF92].\nTheorem 2.7. Let X be a quasi-projective variety and let Y0 \u2282 Y1 \u2282 Y2 a triple of projective\nvarieties. Then, the sequence of simplicial abelian groups\nM\u2022 (X, Y1 /Y0 , k) \u2192 M\u2022 (X, Y2 /Y0 , k) \u2192 M\u2022 (X, Y2 /Y1 , k)\n\n(8)\n\nis a fibration sequence and, in particular, there is an associated long exact sequence of homotopy groups.\n\n\f6\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nProof. The proof is analogous as proposition 3.2 in [LF92] using the fact that a quotient of\nsimplicial abelian groups produces a fibration sequence (see [GJ99] corollary V.2.7).\nIn the special case in which X = Spec C there is the following comparison result\nProposition 2.8. Let Y be a quasi-projective variety with projective closure Y and closed\ncomplement Y \u221e . Then the natural map M\u2022 (Spec C, Y /Y \u221e ) \u2192 Z\u2022 (Y, k) is a weak homotopy\nequivalence.\nProof. This follows from [FG93] proposition 1.3 and theorem 1.4, which enable us to commute, up to homotopy equivalence, the singular chains functor with the group completion and\nthe quotient in the definitions of M\u2022 (X, Y /Y \u221e , k) and Z\u2022 (Y, k).\nRemark 2.9. In particular, for a quasi-projective Y with closed subvariety Y0 and open\ncomplement U , theorem 2.7 and proposition 2.8 together with the long exact sequence of\nhomotopy groups associated to a fibration gives the long exact sequence\n***\n\n// Lk Hn (Y0 )\n\n// Lk Hn (Y )\n\n// Lk Hn (U )\n\n// Lk Hn\u22121 (Y0 )\n\n// * * *\n\nThis is the localization theorem for Lawson homology (proposition 4.8 in [LF92]).\nDefinition 2.10. Let Y be a projective variety with a given projective embedding Y \u2282 PN .\nLet PN \u2282 PN +1 be the embedding in the first N coordinates, and p\u221e = [0, . . . , 0, 1] \u2208 PN +1\n/ Y is the\n(p\u221e is a choic of a point not in PN ). The Lawson suspension of Y , denoted by \u03a3\nN\n+1\n\u221e\nprojective variety in P\nof the points contained in a line through p that meets Y .\nRemark 2.11. The Lawson suspension induces a continuous algebraic map at the level of\nChow varieties\n/ : C(Y, k) \u2192 C(\u03a3\n/ Y, k + 1),\n\u03a3\nsuch that\n/ 1 [W1 ] + * * * + nr [Wr ]) = n1 [\u03a3\n/ W1 ] + * * * + nr [\u03a3\n/ Wr ].\n\u03a3(n\nThis leads to a very important theorem in the theory.\nTheorem 2.12 (Lawson suspension). The Lawson suspension of cycles induces a map of\nmorphic spaces\n// M (X, \u03a3\n/ Y /\u03a3\n/ Y \u221e , k + 1)\n(9)\nM\u2022 (X, Y /Y \u221e , k)\n\u2022\nwhich is a homotopy equivalence.\nProof.

The projection p : X \u00d7 A1 \u2192 X induces, through pull-back of cycles, a\nhomotopy equivalence\n\u223c\nZ\u2022 (X, k) \u2192 Z\u2022 (X \u00d7 A1 , k + 1).\n(10)\n/ X \\ {p\u221e } = X \u00d7 A1 , this becomes a consequence of the localization\nProof. Using that \u03a3\ntheorem 2.7, the suspension theorem 2.12 and the homotopy equivalence 2.8 between the\nspace of cycles Z\u2022 (Y ) and M\u2022 (Spec C, Y /Y \u221e , k).\n\n2.2 Morphic cohomology complexes\nAs said in the begining of this section, to construct the morphic cohomology we will need an\nalgebraic analogue of Map(X, K(Z, 2q)). Since Z(Aq , 0) is an algebraic model of a K(Z, 2q), it\nwould makes sense to use the spaces M\u2022 (X, At , k). We have defined those spaces for a pair of\nprojective varieties (Y , Y \u221e ) not for a quasi-projective Y alone, but At has a natural choice of\nprojective closure, Y = Pt for which the closed complement is\n\b\nY \u221e = [x0 : * * * : xt ] \u2208 Pt | x0 = 0 = Pt\u22121 .\n\nSo a good candidate spaces computing the morphic cohomology are M\u2022 (X, Pt /Pt\u22121 , k). There\nare two indices involved in this construction, t and k apart from the one appearing when taking\nhomotopy groups, but thanks to the suspension theorem 2.12, one index amongst t and k is\nredundant as\n\u223c\nM\u2022 (X, Pt /Pt\u22121 , k) \u2192 M\u2022 (X, Pt+1 /Pt , k + 1)\n\nis a homotopy equivalence. What really matters is the difference q = t \u2212 k. So we get rid\nof the useless index in a way that ensures good functorial properties in situations where the\nsuspension is involved.\nDefinition 2.14. The morphic space of level q associated to a quasi-projective algebraic\nvariety X is the simplicial abelian group M\u2022 (X, q) given as the colimit\nM\u2022 (X, q) = colim M\u2022 (X, Pq+k /Pq+k\u22121 , k).\nk\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the maps\n\u223c\n\nM\u2022 (X, Pq+k /Pq+k\u22121 , k) \u2192 M\u2022 (X, Pq+k+1 /Pq+k , k + 1)\nare the homotopy equivalences in the suspension theorem.\nThe morphic cohomology groups of X are the groups Lq H n (X) given by\nLq H n (X) = \u03c02q\u2212n M\u2022 (X, q).\n\n(12)\n\n\f8\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nRemark 2.15. All the maps M\u2022 (X, Pq+k /Pq+k\u22121 , k) \u2192 M\u2022 (X, q) are homotopy equivalences.\nIn particular,\nLq H n (X) \u2243 \u03c02q\u2212n M\u2022 (X, Pq+k /Pq+k\u22121 , k)\n(13)\nfor any k \u2265 0.\nRecall that, for an abelian category A, the Dold-Kan correspondence establishes an equivalence\nN : sA \u2192 Ch+ (A)\n(14)\nbetween the categories sA of simplicial objects in A and the category Ch+ (A) of positively\ngraded chain complexes in A. For every simplicial object A\u2022 in sA, the associated normalized\nchain complex N\u2217 (A) is such that\n\u03c0n A\u2022 \u2243 Hn N\u2217 (A).\n\n(15)\n\nApplying the Dold-Kan functor N to the morphic cohomology spaces M\u2022 (X, q) we obtain\na chain complex of abelian groups. It is convenient, in analogy with the motivic world, to\nreindex those morphic complexes as follows:\nM n (X, q) = M2q\u2212n (X, q),\n\n(16)\n\nobtaining a cochain complex of abelian groups M \u2217 (X, q), which is zero for n > 2q, so it is\nbounded above, but is unbounded below.\nThere is a couple of important properties we will use.\nTheorem 2.16. Let X be an algebraic variety and p : E \u2192 X be a vector bundle over X.\nThen the induced map\nM\u2022 (X, q) \u2192 M\u2022 (E, q)\n(17)\nis a weak homotopy equivalence and, in particular, the respective morphic cohomology groups\nare isomorphic.\nProof. Proposition 3.5 in [Fri98] tells us that the map M\u2022 (X, Y, q) \u2192 M\u2022 (E, Y, q) between\nbivariant spaces is a homotopy equivalence for Y projective. Then a five lemma argument\napplied to the pair Pq /Pq\u22121 proves what we want.\nTheorem 2.17 (Duality). Let X be a quasi-projective variety of dimension d. There is a\nnatural map\n\u0393 : M\u2022 (X, q) \u2192 Z\u2022 (X \u00d7 Aq , d)\n(18)\ncalled the graphing construction.\nMoreover, when X is smooth, \u0393 becomes a homotopy equivalence. In such case gives isomorphisms\n\u223c\nLq H n (X) \u2192 Ld\u2212q H2d\u2212n (X).\n(19)\n\n\f9\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nProof. The map \u0393 is constructed and proved to be a homotopy equivalence for smooth\nvarieties in [FL97] theorem 3.3 when X is projective and extended to the quasi-projective case\nin [Fri98] theorem 5.2. The isomorphism (19) comes from the combination of the homotopy\nequivalence \u0393 and the homotopy invariance for cycle spaces 2.13.\nCorollary 2.18. Let X be smooth and {U, V } an open covering of X. Then the diagram\nM \u2217 (X, q)\n\n// M \u2217 (U, q)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// M \u2217 (U \u2229 V, q)\n\nM \u2217 (V, q)\n\n(20)\n\ngives rise to a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence for morphic cohomology\n***\n\n// Lq H n (X)\n\n// Lq H n (U ) \u2295 Lq H n (V )\n\n// Lq H n (U \u2229 V )\n\n// * * *\n\n(21)\n\nProof. As X is smooth, The duality theorem implies that the square (20) is quasi-isomorphic\nto the diagram obtained applying the Dold-Kan functor to\nZ\u2022 (X \u00d7 Aq , d)\n\n// Z\u2022 (U \u00d7 Aq , d)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// Z\u2022 (U \u2229 V \u00d7 Aq , d)\n\nZ\u2022 (V \u00d7 Aq , d)\n\nThat last square is homotopy cartesian, because by the localization theorem 2.7 the homotopy\nfibers of the horizontal maps are Z\u2022 ((X \\ U ) \u00d7 Aq , d) and Z\u2022 ((V \\ U ) \u00d7 Aq , d), and those spaces\nare homotopy equivalent (in fact isomorphic) as X \\ U = V \\ U .\n\n2.3 A modification of the morphic cohomology\nWe are interested in using homotopy invariance and Mayer-Vietoris properties for morphic\ncohomology. Those properties hold for smooth varieties thanks to duality (theorems 2.16 and\n2.18) but unfortunately are not known (at least to the author) to hold for singular varieties.\nSo we modify the definition of morphic cohomology to force those two properties. This is not\nnew. In [Fri00] Friedlander defines a modified morphic cohomology, called topological cycle\ncohomology, which satisfies a Mayer-Vietoris propery for Zariski open covers. In fact, the\npoint of [Fri00] is to prove that this theory together with a homological companion satisfies\nthe Bloch-Ogus axioms.\nFirst of all, note that the contravariant functoriality of the complexes M \u2217 (X, q) with respect to X makes them a cochain complexes of presheaves of abelian groups on the category\nqProjC .\nLet \u2206\u2022 be the standard cosimplicial scheme\n\b\n\u2206n = (x0 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 An+1 | x0 + * * * + xn = 1 .\n\n\f10\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nDefinition 2.19. We define the morphic complexes of sheaves M\u2217zar (q) as the Zariski sheafification of the presheaf of complexes M \u2217 (-, q), that is\nMnzar (q) = shzar M \u2217 (-, q).\n\n(22)\n\nAdditionally, we define the homotopy invariant morphic complexes as the following total\ncomplex\nMnhi (q) = Totn M\u2217zar (- \u00d7 \u2206\u2022 , q).\n(23)\nRemark 2.20. The complexes M\u2217 (q) are unbounded below and bounded above by 2q. This\nposes some homological algebra troubles as they are bounded on the wrong side. However, due\nto a result of Spaltenstein [Spa88] one can still have resolutions M\u2217 (q) \u2192 I \u2217 playing the role of\ninjective resolutions. Those are called K-injective in [Spa88]. Later, we will use cohomological\nfiniteness arguments to prove convergence of the spectral sequences we encounter.\nWe will think of the complexes M\u2217zar (q) and M\u2217hi (q) as objects in the derived category\nD\u2212 Sh(qProjC ) of abelian sheaves on the Zariski site qProjC .\nFor any variety X, and a complex of sheaves F \u2217 \u2208 D\u2212 Sh(qProjC ), we will denote by F \u2217 |X\nthe restriction of F \u2217 to the small zariski site of X, i.e. F \u2217 |X is an element in the category\nD\u2212 Sh(X), the derived category of abelian sheaves on X.\nThis sheaf-theoretic interpretation leads to natural reformulations of the morphic cohomology\ngroups.\nDefinition 2.21. The topological cycle cohomology groups are the hypercohomology groups\nn\nLq Hzar\n(X) = Hn (X, Mzar (q)|X ).\n\n(24)\n\nThe homotopy invariant morphic cohomology are the hypercohomology groups\nn\n(X) = Hn (X, Mhi (q)|X ).\nLq Hhi\n\n(25)\n\nn (X) are the ones defined\nRemark 2.22. The topological cycle cohomology groups Lq Hzar\nby Friedlander in [Fri00]. Although the original morphic cohomology groups are homotopy\nn . This is the\ninvariant by 2.16, we are not able to prove this homotopy invariance for Lq Hzar\nq\nn\nreason for introducing the theory L Hhi which exhibits both properies, homotopy invariance\nand Mayer-Vietoris.\n\nRemark 2.23. The hypercohomologies in 2.21 can be rephrased as an ext-group on the\nderived category D\u2212 Sh(X) of sheaves of abelian groups on X, for example\nn\nLq Hhi\n(X) = ExtnSh(X) (ZX , M\u2217hi (q)|X ),\n\nwhere ZX denotes the constant sheaf on X.\n\n(26)\n\n\f11\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nMoreover, let ZhX denote the free abelian group generated by the sheaf on qProjC represented\nby X, i.e. ZhX (U ) = Z Hom(U, X). Then there is an isomorphism\nn\n(X) = ExtnSh(qProjC ) (ZhX , M\u2217hi (q)),\nLq Hhi\n\n(27)\n\nwhere now the Ext is taken in the category of sheaves on the big site qProjC .\nWe will use either interpretation, as an Ext in the big site or in the small site.\nThis new versions of morphic cohomology are related to the old one as follows. There are\ncomparison morphisms\na\n\nM \u2217 (-, q)\n\n// M\u2217 (q)\nzar\n\nb\n\n// M\u2217 (q) ,\nhi\n\n(28)\n\nthe first is the inclusion of a presheaf in its associated sheaf, and the second is the inclusion into\nthe summand of the total complex corresponding to the algebraic simplex \u22060 .\nAs defined in 2.14, Lq H n (X) is the homology of the complex of global sections of the cochain\ncomplex of presheaves M \u2217 (-, q), while the other two flavours of morphic cohomology are the\nhypercohomology of the respective sheaves.\n\u2217 and M\u2217 (q) \u2192 I \u2217 . There are induced\nLet's take then K-injective resolutions M\u2217zar (q) \u2192 Izar\nhi\nhi\ncomparison maps\n\nM \u2217 (-, q)\n\na\n\n// I \u2217\nzar\n\nb\n\n// I \u2217 ,\nhi\n\nwhich, when taking cohomology of the global sections induce comparison maps\na\n\nLq H n (X)\n\n// Lq H n (X)\nzar\n\nb\n\n// Lq H n (X) .\nhi\n\n(29)\n\nProposition 2.24. Assume X is a smooth quasi-projective variety. Then the comparison\nmorphisms (29) are isomorphisms.\nProof. From 2.18 we know that the presheaf M\u2022 (-, q) restricted to smooth varieties satisfies\nthe Mayer-Vietoris propery, that is, the square\nM \u2217 (X, q)\n\n// M \u2217 (U, q)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// M \u2217 (U \u2229 V, q)\n\nM \u2217 (V, q)\n\n\u2217 . Using the Brownis homotopy cartesian. Take a K-injective resolution M\u2217zar (q) \u2192 Izar\nGersten theorem ([Voe00] lemma 3.5) we conclude that the presheaf M \u2217 (-, q) is globally weakly\nequivalent to the K-injective resolution I \u2217 , so\n\u2217\nH n \u0393(X, M \u2217 (-, q)) \u2243 H n \u0393(X, Izar\n),\n\n\f12\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\nand this settles the first isomorphism a.\n\nAs for b, by theorem 2.16 we know that Lq H n (-) is a homotopy invariant functor, and by\nn (-) on smooth varieties, so the last one is also\nthe previous isomorphism coincides with Lq Hzar\nhomotopy invariant on smooth varieties. Then the spectral sequence associated to the double\nn degenerates on the second page and this gives the isomorphism b.\ncomplex defining Lq Hhi\nn.\nFinally, those are the properties we will use of the modified theory Lq Hhi\n\nTheorem 2.25. Let U, V be an open cover of a complex variety X. Then there is a Mayern\nVietoris long exact sequence for the groups Lq Hhi\n***\n\n// Lq H n (X)\nhi\n\n// Lq H n (U ) \u2295 Lq H n (V )\nhi\nhi\n\n// Lq H n (U \u2229 V )\nhi\n\n// * * *\n\n(30)\n\nProof.

The groups Lq H n (X) are homotopy invariant, that is the projection p : X \u00d7\nA1 \u2192 X induces isomorphisms\n\u223c\n\nLq H n (X) \u2192 Lq H n (X \u00d7 A1 ).\n\n(32)\n\nProof. This is a standard argument. See for example corollary 2.19 in [MVW06]\n\n2.4 Some remarks about notation\nn of\nRemark 2.27. In the remainder of this paper we will deal only with the version Lq Hhi\nmorphic cohomology, as we are interested in using a version of a Mayer-Vietoris spectral\nsequence and homotopy invariance. We will drop the subindex \"hi\" from the notation for\nreadability.\n\nIt will be useful to deal with the morphic complexes all at once, so we define the complex of\nsheaves\nM\nM\u2217 =\nM\u2217 (q).\nq\u22650\n\nThis is a bigraded object, having the algebraic degree q and the cohomological degree n with a\ndifferential for the n-grading.

Following [FW01] proposition 3.2, the projections \u03c0X : X\u00d7X \u2032 \u2192 X and\n\u03c0X \u2032 : X\u00d7X \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 induce exterior products on morphic complexes\nM \u2217 (X, q) \u2297 M \u2217 (X \u2032 , q \u2032 ) \u2192 M \u2217 (X \u00d7 X \u2032 , q + q \u2032 ).\n\n(33)\n\nComposing this exterior product with the pull-back through the diagonal embedding \u2206 : X \u2192\nX \u00d7 X we get a cup product\nM \u2217 (X, q) \u2297 M \u2217 (X, q \u2032 ) \u2192 M \u2217 (X \u00d7 X, q + q \u2032 ) \u2192 M \u2217 (X, q + q \u2032 ),\n\n(34)\n\nwhich induces a cup product\nM\u2217 (q) \u2297 M\u2217 (q \u2032 ) \u2192 M\u2217 (q + q \u2032 ).\n\n(35)\n\non the sheaves M\u2217 .\nTheorem 2.28.

See [FL92] corollary 6.2.\n\n\f14\n\n2 Morphic cohomology\n\nLet M\u2217 (pt) = \u0393(Spec C, M\u2217 ) be the sections of the morphic complex on a point, and let\nLH(pt) be its hypercohomology, which in this case coincides with the cohomology ring of the\nglobal sections M\u2217 (pt).\nCorollary 2.29. The morphic cohomology of a complex quasi-projective variety X has a\ncanonical structure of LH(pt)-module.\nProof. Applying the second part of theorem 2.28 to the structure map X \u2192 Spec C we get\na ring homomorphism LH(pt) \u2192 LH(X), making LH(X) into a LHpt-module.\nNow, the exterior product (33) also induces an exterior product on morphic cohomology\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nLq H n (X) \u2297 Lq H n (X \u2032 ) \u2192 Lq+q H n+n (X \u00d7 X \u2032 ).\n\n(37)\n\nAs the structure of LHpt-module in LH(X) is functorial, the action of LH(pt) on either\nfactor on the left of (37), gives the same action on the right, so the exterior product map (37)\nfactors through\nLH(X) \u2297LHpt LH(Y ) \u2192 LH(X \u00d7 Y ).\n(38)\nIn rather special circumstances this Kunneth homomorphism (38) happens to be an isomorphism.

The K\u00fcnneth homomorphism\nLH(X) \u2297LHpt LH(Gm ) \u2192 LH(X \u00d7 Gm ).\n\n(39)\n\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. Let i : pt \u2192 A1 be the inclusion of a point and j : Gm \u2192 A1 its open complement. We\nhave the following commutative diagram of long exact sequences\n\n* * * LH(X) \u2297LHpt LH(pt)\n\u000f\u000f\n\n* * * LH(X \u00d7 pt)\n\nid\u00d7i!\n\n// LH(X) \u2297LH(pt) LH(A1 )\n\nid\u00d7j \u2217\n\n(id\u00d7i)!\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// LH(X \u00d7 A1 )\n\n(id\u00d7j)\u2217\n\n// LH(X) \u2297LH(pt) LH(Gm ) * * *\n\u000f\u000f\n// LH(X \u00d7 Gm ) * * *\n\nThe vertical maps are the Kunneth morphisms, and i! is the Gysin map defined by duality\n(theorem 2.17) as i! = \u0393\u22121\n\u2217 i\u2217 \u0393\u2217 . The exactness of the rows come, by duality, from the\nlocalization theorem 2.7 and the long exact sequence of homotopy groups of a fibration.\nNow a standard application of the five lemma together with the homotopy invariance 2.16\nproves the desired isomorphism.\n\n\f15\n\n3 Toric varieties\n\nRemark 2.31. I became aware of a construction of a Kunneth spectral sequence in the case\nin which X or Y is a linear variety in a private communication with Mircea Voineagu [Voi08a].\nAn analogous construction is done in [Jos01] for higher Chow groups and K-theory.\nFinally, some basic computations of morphic cohomology rings we will need.\n1.

The morphic cohomology of the multiplicative group is given by\nLH(Gm ) \u2243 Z[s, e]/(e2 ),\nwhere s is a generator of bidegree (1, 0) and e is a generator of bidegree (1, 1).\nProof. 1) and 2) follow from duality and the computations of Lawson homology using the\nsuspension theorem 2.12.\n3) Take the open cover of P1 by two affines. Then we have the following piece of Mayer-Vietoris\nsequence\nLH n (P1 )\n\n// LH n (A1 )\u22952\n\n// LH n (Gm )\n\n// LH n+1 (P1 )\n\n// LH n+1 (A1 )\u22952\n\nwhich, using 1) and 2) for the computations of P1 and A1 gives the result.\nRemark 2.33. Note that, in particular, LH(pt) \u2243 Z[s]. As a consequence of 2.29, the\nmorphic cohomology ring LH(X) is, in fact, a Z[s]-module. The action by s on LH(X)\ncorresponds to the s-maps defined in [FM94].\n\n3 Toric varieties\nFirst we set the notation. Let N \u2243 Zn be a free Z-module of rank n, and M its dual Zmodule. We will denote by NR = N \u2297 R and MR = M \u2297 R. In this way, N and M are to be\nthought as lattices on NR and MR . Moreover, there is the duality pairing hu, vi for u \u2208 NR\nand v \u2208 MR .\n\n\f16\n\n3 Toric varieties\n\n3.1 Cones and fans\nDefinition 3.1.

Let \u03c3 be a rational polyhedral cone in N .\n1. The dual cone of \u03c3 is a rational polyhedral cone in M given by\n\u03c3 \u2228 = {v \u2208 MR | hu, vi \u2265 0 for all u \u2208 \u03c3} .\n2. The orhogonal cone of \u03c3 is a rational polyhedral cone in M given by\n\u03c3 \u22a5 = {v \u2208 MR | hu, vi = 0 for all u \u2208 \u03c3} .\nRemark 3.3. The orthogonal cone \u03c3 \u22a5 is in fact a vector space, as if hu, vi = 0 then hu, \u03bbvi = 0\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 R.\nDefinition 3.4. A cone \u03c4 is a face of \u03c3 if there exists a u \u2208 MR such that\n\u03c4 = \u03c3 \u2229 u\u22a5 .\nDefinition 3.5. A fan \u2206 is a set of strongly convex rational polyhedral cones in N such that\n1. Every face of a cone in \u2206 also belongs to \u2206.\n2. The intersection of two cones in \u2206 is a face of both intersecting cones.\nThe notation \u2206(k) will mean the set of all cones of codimension k in \u2206.\nRemark 3.6. A fan has a partial order given by the inclusion of faces. We will use the\nnotation \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c3 to say that \u03c4 is a face of \u03c3.\nDefinition 3.7. An orientation of a cone \u03c3 is an orientation of the vector spaces R\u03c3.\nAn orientation of a fan \u2206 will be a choice of an orientation for every cone in \u2206.\nWe will always use fans with a fixed orientation.\nRemark 3.8. Let \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c3 be a face of codimension 1 in \u03c3. This means that there exists a\nu \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 such that \u03c4 = \u03c3 \u2229 u\u22a5 . Then we have an isomorphism\nR\u03c3 \u2243 Ru \u2295 R\u03c4.\n\n(40)\n\nwhich allows us to transfer the orientation of \u03c3 to \u03c4 as follows: the orientation induced on \u03c4\nby \u03c3 is the one compatible with the isomorphism (40) and taking the orientation in Ru given\nby the vector u.\n\n\f17\n\n3 Toric varieties\n\n3.2 Definition of a toric variety\nLet us fix a field k. For now it will be an aribrary field, but in the next sections we will set\nk = C.\nWe describe the toric variety X(\u2206) associated to a fan \u2206. The scheme X(\u2206) is constructed\nlocally, one affine piece for every cone in \u2206, and then glueing them, according to the combinatorics of the fan, to build the scheme X(\u2206).\nFor every cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206 we define an affine scheme\nX\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ],\nwhere \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M is seen as a monoid and k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] is its monoid algebra. An inclusion\nof cones \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c3 induces an inclusion on dual cones \u03c3 \u2228 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2228 and this induces a morphism on the corresponding monoid algebras, obtaining a morphism of schemes i\u03c4,\u03c3 : X\u03c4 \u2192\nX\u03c3 .\nProposition 3.9. Let \u2206 be a fan on a lattice N of dimension n.\n1. For every face inclusion \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c3, the induced morphism i\u03c4,\u03c3 : X\u03c4 \u2192 X\u03c3 is an open\nembedding.\n2. There is a (unique) k-scheme X(\u2206) together with a family of open embeddings i\u03c3 : X\u03c3 \u2192\nX(\u2206) for every cone in \u2206 such that X\u03c3 is an open covering of X(\u2206) and for every pair\nof cones \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c3, the following diagram commutes\nX\u03c4 F\nF\n\ni\u03c4,\u03c3\n\n// X\u03c3\n\nFF\nFF\nFF\n\"\" \u000f\u000f\n\ni\u03c4\n\ni\u03c3\n\nX(\u2206)\n3. The scheme X(\u2206) is reduced, normal and Noetherian. Moreover, if the cones in \u2206 cover\nthe whole NR the variety X(\u2206) is complete.\n4. For \u03c4, \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206, the face inclusions of \u03c4 \u2229 \u03c3 induce an isomorphism\nX\u03c4 \u2229\u03c3 \u2243 X\u03c4 \u00d7X(\u2206) X\u03c3 .\nProof. See [Ful93], sections 1.4 and 2.1.\nDefinition 3.10. A toric variety for a fan \u2206 is an algebraic variety X(\u2206) associated \u2206 as\nin the previous theorem.\n\n\f18\n\n3 Toric varieties\n\nExample 3.11. Let N be a lattice of rank n and \u2206 the fan containing only the cone {0}.\nThen X(\u2206) is an algebraic torus of dimension n, that is there is an isomorphism\nX(\u2206) = Spec k[M ] \u2243 Gnm .\nThis algebraic torus is, in fact, a commutative group scheme, and the group law is described\nby the comultiplication on the coordinate ring k[M ] \u2192 k[M ] \u2297 k[M ] given by m 7\u2192 m \u2297 m\nfor every m \u2208 M and extended by linearity.\nRemark 3.12. Every toric variety X(\u2206) contains an algebraic torus as a dense open set,\ncorresponding to the affine piece\nX0 = Spec k[M ] \u2243 Gnm\nassociated to the cone 0 \u2208 \u2206.\nThe group law on the torus X0 can be extended to an action on the whole toric variety.\nLocally on an open piece X\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] this action is given by the morphism of rings\nk[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2192 k[M ] \u2297 k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ]\nsuch that m \u2192 m \u2297 m for every m \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M . Then all those local actions glue together\nforming an action\nX0 \u00d7 X(\u2206) \u2192 X(\u2206).\nTo every cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206, we can associate an affine scheme T\u03c3 besides the open affine X\u03c3 we\nhave already constructed,\nT\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ].\nObserve that There is a homomorphism of rings\nk[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2192 k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ]\nsending every element of \u03c3 \u22a5 to themselves and the elements of \u03c3 \u2228 not in \u03c3 \u22a5 to 0. This\nhomomorphism induces a morphism of schemes\nT\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ] \u2192 X\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ],\nand composing with the embedding i\u03c3 : X\u03c3 \u2192 X(\u2206) we get morphisms j\u03c3 : T\u03c3 \u2192 X(\u2206).\nOn the other hand, we have retractions r\u03c3 : X\u03c3 \u2192 T\u03c3 defined by the inclusion \u03c3 \u22a5 \u2192\n\u03c3\u2228.\nProposition 3.13. For every cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206, the morphism\nj\u03c3 : T\u03c3 \u2192 X(\u2206),\nis a locally closed embedding and corresponds with an orbit of the torus action.\nMoreover, the collection of all T\u03c3 for all the cones \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206 give the orbit decomposition of the\ntorus action on the toric variety X(\u2206).\n\n\f19\n\n3 Toric varieties\nProof. See [Ful93] section 3.1.\n\nRemark 3.14. Note that the orbits T\u03c3 are algebraic tori whose dimension is the codimension\nof \u03c3, i.e.\ndim T\u03c3 = n \u2212 dim \u03c3.\nIn short, associated to a toric variety we have an open cover given by the affine pieces\nX\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ],\nand an orbit decomposition as a disjoint union of tori\nT\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ].\nThere is a relation between them in terms of the combinatorics of the fan as follows:\nProposition 3.15. We have the following disjoint union decompositions,\n[\nX\u03c3 =\nT\u03c4 ,\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nT\u03c4 =\n\n[\n\nT\u03c3 .\n\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nProof. See [Ful93] section 3.1.\nRemark 3.16. In particular, the orbit T\u03c3 is closed in X\u03c3 , and is the lowest dimensional orbit\ncontained in it.\nProposition 3.17. Let X(\u2206) be a toric variety and \u03c3 a cone in \u2206. There is a morphism\nh : X\u03c3 \u00d7 A1k \u2192 X\u03c3\nsuch that\n1. h(\u2212, 1) = id,\n2. h(\u2212, 0) = j\u03c3 r\u03c3 ,\n3. h(\u2212, t) restricts to the identity on T\u03c3 for every t.\nSo, the morphism h gives an algebraic homotopy equivalence between X\u03c3 and T\u03c3 .\n\n\f20\n\n3 Toric varieties\n\nProof. We have X\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ], T\u03c3 = Spec k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ]. The inclusion T\u03c3 \u2192 X\u03c3 is given\nby the quotient\nk[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2192 k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ],\nwhich is the identity on \u03c3 \u22a5 and sends any element v \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 not in \u03c3 \u22a5 to 0 \u2208 k[\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ].\nPick u0 \u2208 \u03c3 such that \u03c3 \u22a5 = \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 u\u22a5\n0 . Then define\nh\u2217 : k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2192 k[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2297 k[t],\nby h\u2217 (v) = v \u2297 thu0 ,vi for every v \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 . This gives a morphism of schemes h : X\u03c3 \u00d7 A1k \u2192 X\u03c3\nwith the desired properties.\n\n3.3 Morphic cohomology of an algebraic torus\nNow we compute the morphic cohomology ring of an algebraic torus. As we will need this\ncomputation for subtori of a toric variety, it will be useful to have a canonical description of\nthis ring in terms of the lattice defining the toric variety.\nLet N be a lattice of rank n, and LR \u2282 MR = NR\u2228 a subspace of dimension r generated by\nvectors in the lattice M . Consider the rank r sublattice L = LR \u2229 M , and its associated\ntorus\nTL = Spec C[L].\nAs we have seen in 2.32, LH 1 (Gm ) \u2243 Z[s]e with e a generator in bidegree (1, 1) which\ncorresponds, by duality, to a radial Borel-Moore chain joining 0 and \u221e in Gm . Now, any\nv \u2208 L defines a character \u03c7v : TL \u2192 Spec C[v, v \u22121 ] = Gm , so we can now define a morphism\nof rings\n\u03c6 : (\u2227\u2217 L) \u2297 LHpt \u2192 LH \u2217 (TL )\n(41)\nby\n\u03c6(v \u2297 1) = \u03c7\u2217v (e),\nfor v \u2208 L, and extended in the obvious way to the exterior algebra because LH \u2217 (TL ) is a\ngraded commutative algebra (theorem 2.28). On the left hand side of (41) the vectors in the\nlattice L are assumed to have bigrading (1, 1).\nTheorem 3.18. The morphism \u03c6 is an isomorphism.\nProof. We argue by induction on the rank of L. The isomorphism is clear when rank L = 1\nby the computation in 2.32. Let L = L0 \u2295 Zv. This gives a product decomposition TL =\n\n\f21\n\n4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\n\nTL0 \u00d7 Gm . Now, because the Kunneth isomorphism in 2.30 preserves the cup product, we get\na commutative diagram\n\u2227n L \u2297 LH(pt)\n\u03c6\n\n//\n\nL\n\np+q=n (\u2227\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nLH n (TL )\n//\n\nL\n\npL\n\n0\n\n\u2297 LH(pt)) \u2297LH(pt) (\u2227q Zv \u2297 LH(pt))\n\u000f\u000f\n\np\nq\np+q=n LH (TL0 ) \u2297LH(pt) LH (Gm )\n\nThe upper row is an isomorphism by multilinear algebra results, while the lower row is an\nisomorphism by the Kunneth isomorphism 2.30. The right vertical map is a sum of tensor\nproducts of \u03c6's corresponding to lower dimensional tori, so are isomorphisms by induction\nhypothesis. We conclude then that the left vertical map is an isomorphism.\n\n4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\nLet X(\u2206) be a complete toric variety of dimension n, R a ring (possibly graded) and F \u2217 a\ncochain complex of sheaves of R-modules on X. As usual, the hypercohomology of F \u2217 will\nbe\nHn (X(\u2206), F \u2217 ) = H n \u0393(X(\u2206), I \u2217 )\nwhere I \u2217 is a K-injectives resolution F \u2217 \u2192 I \u2217 .\nIn this section we will write down a spectral sequence converging to the hypercohomology\nHn (X(\u2206), F \u2217 ) whose E2 page is computable in terms of the combinatorics of the toric variety,\nand the hypercohomology of F \u2217 on algebraic tori. The spectral sequence comes from the\nidentification\nHn (X(\u2206), F \u2217 ) = Extn (RX , F \u2217 ),\nand the fact that the hyper-ext can be computed resolving either variable. We will chose to\nresolve the constant sheaf RX producing a \u010cech-like resolution C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX ) \u2192 RX from the\ncombinatorics of the toric variety.\nA similar idea to ours, applied to singular homology and cohomology, was previously developed\nin the thesis [Jor98].\n\n4.1 Resolution associated to a fan\nLet X(\u2206) be a complete toric variety defined by a fan \u2206, and let R be a commutative\nring.\nDefinition 4.1. Let \u010ck (\u2206, R) for k \u2265 0 be the sequence of free R-modules\nM\n\u010ck (\u2206, R) =\nR[\u03c3],\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(k)\n\n\f22\n\n4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\nwith basis \u2206(k) , together with R-morphisms dk : \u010ck (\u2206, R) \u2192 \u010ck\u22121 (\u2206, R) defined by\ndk ([\u03c4 ])\u03c3 = \u01eb(\u03c4, \u03c3),\n\nwhere \u01eb(\u03c4, \u03c3) = \u00b11 according to whether the orientation induced by \u03c3 on \u03c4 coincides or not\nwith the orientation in \u03c4 (remember, we assume a fixed choice of orientation on every cone).\nDefinition 4.2. Let C\u02c7k (\u2206, RX ) for k \u2265 0 be the sequence of sheaves of R-modules on X(\u2206)\ngiven by\nM\nC\u02c7k (\u2206, RX ) =\ni\u03c3! i\u2217\u03c3 RX ,\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(k)\n\nwhere RX is the constant sheaf on X(\u2206) and i\u03c3 : X\u03c3 \u2192 X(\u2206) is the inclusion of the open\nX\u03c3 .\nMoreover, we define, a sequence of morphisms dk : C\u02c7k (\u2206, RX ) \u2192 C\u02c7k\u22121 (\u2206, RX ) given by\nM\ndk =\n\u01eb(\u03c4, \u03c3)\u03b9\u03c4,\u03c3\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(k\u22121)\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206(k)\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nwhere \u03b9\u03c4,\u03c3 : i\u03c4 ! i\u2217\u03c4 RX \u2192 i\u03c3! i\u2217\u03c3 RX is the natural inclusion of sheaves inducing the identity on the\nnonzero fibers.\nDefinition 4.3. Given a fan \u2206 and a cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206 of codimension k, we define a fan \u2206\u03c3\ndefined on the lattice N/(R\u03c3 \u2229 N ) of dimension k, whose cones are the projection of cones in\n\u2206 having \u03c3 as a face.\nRemark 4.4. Notice that the cones in \u2206\u03c3 correspond bijectively with the cones \u03c4 \u2208 \u2206 having\n\u03c3 as a face.\nLet x \u2208 X(\u2206) be a point.\nT\u03c3(x) .\n\nWe denote by \u03c3(x) the unique cone in \u2206 such that x \u2208\n\nRemark 4.5. Observe that\n(i\u03c4 ! i\u2217\u03c4 RX )x\n\n=\n\n(\n\nR\n0\n\nif \u03c3(x) \u2264 \u03c4 ,\notherwise.\n\nIn other words, the fiber (i\u03c4 ! i\u2217\u03c4 RX )x is nonzero exactly for the cones \u03c4 \u2208 \u2206\u03c3(x) .\nThis allows us to define a morphism of R-modules\nfk,x : C\u02c7k (\u2206, RX )x \u2192 \u010ck (\u2206\u03c3(x) , R)\nwhich is the identity on every nonzero summand, as the summands on the right correspond\nexactly to the nonzero summands on the left.\n\n\f23\n\n4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\nProposition 4.6. Let X(\u2206) be a complete toric variety associated to a fan \u2206.\n\n1. The sequence of R-modules \u010ck (\u2206, R) together with the differentials dk form a chain\ncomplex of R-modules, that is,\ndk\u22121 dk = 0.\n2. The diagram\nC\u02c7k (\u2206, RX )x\n\nfk,x\n\n// \u010ck (\u2206\u03c3(x) , R)\ndk\n\ndk\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nC\u02c7k\u22121 (\u2206, RX )x\n\nfk\u22121,x\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n// \u010ck\u22121 (\u2206\u03c3(x) , R)\n\nis commutative, and the rows are isomorphisms.\n3. The sequence of sheaves of R-modules C\u02c7k (\u2206, RX ) together with the differentials dk form\na chain complex of sheaves of R-modules.\nProof. 1) Let [\u03c4 ] be an element of the basis of \u010ck (\u2206, R). Then we have\nX\ndk\u22121 dk ([\u03c4 ])\u03b7 =\n\u01eb(\u03b7, \u03c3)\u01eb(\u03c3, \u03c4 )\n\u03b7<\u03c3<\u03c4\n\nand either there is no \u03c3 in between \u03b7 and \u03c4 or there are exactly two of them, giving opposite\nsigns.\n2) Follows easily from the definition and remark 4.5.\n3) From 1 and 2 together we see that dk\u22121,x dk,x : C\u02c7k (\u2206, RX )x \u2192 C\u02c7k\u22122 (\u2206, RX )x is zero. Then\nas (dk\u22121 dk )x = dk\u22121,x dk,x and a morphism of sheaves which is zero on the fibers is the zero\nmorphism, we are done.\nDefinition 4.7. Let a : \u010c\u2217 (\u2206, R) \u2192 R be the augmentation morphism given by\nX\na(x) =\nx\u03c4 ,\n\n(42)\n\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206(0)\n\nwhere x =\n\nP\n\nx\u03c4 [\u03c4 ] \u2208 \u010c0 (\u2206, R).\n\nIn a similar way, let a : C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX ) \u2192 RX be the augmentation morphism induced by the\nmorphisms i\u03c3! i\u2217\u03c3 RX \u2192 RX(\u2206) .\nWe will prove that a : C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX ) \u2192 RX is a quasi-isomorphism. To do so, we will relate the\nfiber complexes C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX )x with the cellular homology complex of a cellular decomposition\non the n-dimensional ball.\nLet\nB = {x \u2208 NR | kxk \u2264 1} ,\n\n(43)\n\nS = {x \u2208 NR | kxk = 1} .\n\n(44)\n\n\f24\n\n4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\nDefinition 4.8. For every non-zero cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206 we define the subset e\u03c3 \u2282 S as follows\ne\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2229 S.\n\nProposition 4.9. The subsets e\u03c3 \u2282 S are homeomorphic to closed balls of dimension dim \u03c3 \u2212\n1. Together form a cellular decomposition of the sphere S. The sphere together with this\ndecomposition will be denoted by S\u2206 .\nProof. As e\u03c3 are the intersection of a strictly convex cone with the unit sphere S\u2206 it is clear\nthat are homeomorphic to balls of dimension dim \u03c3 \u2212 1. They cover all S because the fan is\ncomplete. Finally, the boundary of the cell e\u03c3 is formed by the cells associated to the faces\nof \u03c3, and so belong to the lower dimensional skeleton.\nDefinition 4.10. To any complete fan \u2206 we associate an abstract simplicial complex K(\u2206)\nas follows:\n1. The vertices in K(\u2206) correspond to the cones in \u2206.\n2. The k-simplexes in K(\u2206) are the sets of vertices belonging to flags in \u2206 of length k,\nthat is, sequences of strictly included cones\n\u03c40 < \u03c41 < * * * < \u03c4k .\nRemark 4.11. The simplicial complex K(\u2206) is related to the barycentric subdivision of the\nfan \u2206. However, they are not exactly the same thing because of the cone 0 \u2208 \u2206. If we had\nnot admited the cone 0 in the definition of K(\u2206) we would have obtained a combinatorial\nmodel of the barycentric subdivision of the fan \u2206.\nFor every 1-dimensional cone in \u03c4 \u2208 \u2206(n\u22121) let u\u03c4 \u2208 NR be the unique unit vector generating\nit. Then, for any non-zero cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206, let v\u03c3 be the vector\nX\nv\u03c3 =\nu\u03c4 .\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206(n\u22121)\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nDefinition 4.12. For every k-simplex (\u03c40 , . . . , \u03c4k ) \u2208 K(\u2206) given by a flag of cones \u03c40 < * * * <\n\u03c4k , we define a subset d(\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k ) \u2282 B as follows,\n\nd(\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k )\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2{0}\n= R\u22650 hv\u03c41 , . . . , v\u03c4k i \u2229 B\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nR\u22650 hv\u03c40 , . . . , v\u03c4k i \u2229 S\n\nif \u03c40 = 0 and k = 0,\nif \u03c40 = 0 and k > 0,\nif \u03c40 6= 0.\n\n(45)\n\nProposition 4.13. The subsets d\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k \u2282 B are homeomorphic to closed balls of dimension k.\nTogether form a cellular decomposition of the ball B. The ball together with this decomposition\nwill be denoted by BK(\u2206) .\n\n\f4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\n\n25\n\nProof. Let (\u03c40 , . . . , \u03c4k ) \u2208 K(\u2206). Because the vectors v\u03c4i all belong to the cone \u03c4k , the subsets\nR\u22650 hv\u03c40 , . . . , v\u03c4k i are strongly convex cones. Then arguing as in 4.9 for every case in definition\n4.12 we prove that d\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k are balls. As for the statment regarding its dimension, it follows\nfrom the linear independence of the v\u03c4i for any flag 0 6= \u03c40 < * * * < \u03c4k .\nFinally, observe that the boundary of a cell d\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k is formed by the cells resulting from\nremoving one cone in the flag, all of lower dimension. This proves that the cells d\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k give\na cellular decomposition of the ball B.\nDefinition 4.14. For every cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206, let e\u2228\n\u03c3 \u2282 B be the subset defined by\n[\ne\u2228\n=\nd\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k\n\u03c3\n\n(46)\n\nk\u22650\n(\u03c40 ,...,\u03c4k )\u2208K(\u2206)\n\u03c3\u2264\u03c40\n\nProposition 4.15. The subsets e\u2228\n\u03c3 \u2282 B are homeomorphic to closed balls of dimension\ncodim \u03c3. Together form a cellular decomposition of the ball B. The ball together with this\n\u2228.\ndecomposition will be denoted by B\u2206\nProof. Observe that e\u2228\n\u03c3 is a geometric realization of a subcomplex of K(\u2206). Moreover, this\nsubcomplex happens to be isomorphic to K(\u2206\u03c3 ) (follows directly from the definitions). Now,\napplying proposition 4.13 to the simplicial complex K(\u2206\u03c3 ) we get a cellular decomposition\nof a (codim \u03c3)-dimensional ball B\u2206\u03c3 which realizes the simplicial complex K(\u2206\u03c3 ). We have\ntwo geometric realizations of isomorphic simplicial complexes, so they must be isomorphic,\nand we conclude that e\u2228\n\u03c3 is homeomorphic to a (codim \u03c3)-dimensional ball.\nIt is clear that the cells e\u2228\n\u03c3 cover all the ball B, and that they are attached properly, that is\nthe boundary of every cell is contained in a lower dimensional skeleton.\n\u2228 is dual to the cellular decomposition of the\nRemark 4.16. The cellular decomposition B\u2206\nsphere S\u2206 together with an extra n-cell for the interior of the ball.\n\nProposition 4.17. There is a canonical isomorphism of chain complexes\n\u2228\n\u010c\u2217 (\u2206, R) \u2243 C\u2217cell (B\u2206\n, R).\n\u2228 , R),\nProof. There is a canonical isomorphism between the R-modules \u010ck (\u2206, R) and Ckcell (B\u2206\nas both are generated by the cones in codimension k. Note that the unique n-cell in B\u2206\ncorresponds to the zero cone in \u2206.\n\nIt only remains to check that the differentials in \u010c\u2217 (\u2206, R) coincide with the cellular ones. Note\n\u2228\nthat the attaching maps f\u03c4 : \u2202e\u2228\n\u03c4 \u2192 Skcodim \u03c4 \u22121 B\u2206 are homeomorphisms with the image. So,\n\u2228\nfor any lower dimensional cell e\u03c3 on the boundary of e\u2228\n\u03c4 , the corresponding matrix element in\n\u2228\nthe cellular differential is a sign, according to the relative orientation of the cells e\u2228\n\u03c3 and e\u03c4 .\nThis is exactly the differential in \u010c\u2217 (\u2206, R).\n\n\f4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\n\n26\n\nCorollary 4.18. The augmented complex of sheaves\nC\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX ) \u2192 RX\nis exact, that is, C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX ) is a resolution of the constant sheaf RX .\nProof. From proposition 4.6 we know that the fiber of the complex C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, RX ) \u2192 RX at a\npoint x \u2208 X(\u2206) is identified with \u010c(\u2206, R) \u2192 R. Now by proposition 4.17 we know that the\ncomplex \u010c(\u2206, R) is isomorphic to the cellular complex of the cellular decomposition of the\n\u2228 , so its homology is\nball B\u2206\n(\nR for k = 0,\ncell\nHk \u010c(\u2206, R) \u2243 Hk C (B\u2206 , R) =\n0 for k > 0.\nNow, as the augmentation a : \u010c\u2217 (\u2206, R) \u2192 R is given by the sum of the elements on degree\nzero, we conclude that it is a quasi-isomorphism.\n\n4.2 The spectral sequence\nLet X(\u2206) be a toric variety and F \u2217 be a complex of sheaves on X. We describe a spectral\nsequence converging to the hypercohomology Hn (X(\u2206), F \u2217 ).\nDefinition 4.19. A complex of sheaves F \u2217 is said to have homotopy invariant cohomology if\nfor every variety X the projection p : X \u00d7 A1 \u2192 X induces isomorphisms in hypercohomology\n\u223c\n\nHn (X, F \u2217 ) \u2192 Hn (X \u00d7 A1 , F \u2217 ).\nRemark 4.20. The complex of sheaves M\u2217 defining morphic cohomology has homotopy\ninvariant cohomology by 2.26.\nTheorem 4.21. Let X(\u2206) be a toric variety associated to a fan \u2206 and F \u2217 a bounded above\ncochain complex of sheaves. There is a convergent spectral sequence\nE1r,s = Extr (C\u02c7s (\u2206, ZX ), F \u2217 ) =\u21d2 Hr+s (X(\u2206), F \u2217 ).\n\n(47)\n\nMoreover, if F \u2217 has homotopy invariant cohomology,\nM\nE1r,s =\nHr (T\u03c3 , F \u2217 ),\n\n(48)\n\nand the differentials on the first page d1 : E1r,s \u2192 E1r,s+1 are given by\nX\n\u2217\n\u01eb(\u03c4, \u03c3)r\u03c4,\u03c3\nd1 =\n\n(49)\n\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206(s+1)\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\n\f4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\n\n27\n\nwhere\nr\u03c4,\u03c3 : T\u03c4 = Spec C[\u03c4 \u22a5 ] \u2192 T\u03c3 = Spec C[\u03c3 \u22a5 ],\nare the morphisms induced by the natural inclusion \u03c3 \u22a5 \u2192 \u03c4 \u22a5 .\nProof. Let F \u2217 \u2192 I \u2217 be a K-injective resolution of F \u2217 (see remark 2.20). Let C\u02c7\u2217 (\u2206, ZX ) \u2192 ZX\nbe the resolution of the constant sheaf ZX from corollary 4.18. We build a double complex\nC r,s = Hom(C\u02c7s (\u2206, ZX ), I r ),\nwith the induced differentials (going in the increasing direction of r and s). The homology of\nthis double complex in the r direction is Extr (C\u02c7s (\u2206, ZX ), F \u2217 ), giving the spectral sequence\nE1r,s = Extr (C\u02c7s (\u2206, ZX ), F \u2217 ) =\u21d2 Hr+s (X(\u2206), F \u2217 ).\nAs for the convergence. The complex of sheaves I \u2217 is bounded above, and the schemes X\u03c3 have\nfinite cohomological dimension. Using the hypercohomology spectral sequence we conclude\nthat Hk (X\u03c3 , F \u2217 ) is bounded above. In other words, the first page is bounded above in the\nr direction. It is clearly bounded (from both sides) in the s direction, and this is enough to\nestablish the convergence.\nIf F \u2217 is homotopy invariant, as the immersion T\u03c3 \u2192 X\u03c3 are algebraic homotopy equivalences\nwe get the expression (48).\nFinally, the differentials on the first page are induced by the s-differentials in the double\ncomplex C r,s, which are given by the formula\nX\n\u01eb(\u03c4, \u03c3)i\u2217\u03c4,\u03c3\nd1 =\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206(s+1)\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nwhere i\u03c4,\u03c3 : X\u03c4 \u2192 X\u03c3 is the inclusion. The formula (49) follows from the equation\n\u2217\nr\u03c4,\u03c3\n= j\u03c4\u2217 i\u2217\u03c4,\u03c3 r\u03c3\u2217 ,\n\nand the fact that j\u03c4\u2217 and r\u03c3\u2217 are mutually inverse isomorphisms giving the identification\nHr (T\u03c3 , F \u2217 ) \u2243 Hr (X\u03c3 , F \u2217 ).\n\n4.3 Some applications\nWe have a rather explicit description of the first page and differentials of the spectral sequence\nin 4.21. Together with the computation 3.18 of the morphic cohomology of a torus we can\nmake it still more explicit.\n\n\f28\n\n4 Spectral sequence associated to a toric variety\n\nCorollary 4.22. Let F \u2217 = M\u2217 . Then the first page of the spectral sequence in 4.21 is\nM\nE1r,s \u2243\n\u2227r (\u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M ) \u2297 LH(pt)\n(50)\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\nand the differentials ds1 : E1r,s \u2192 E1r,s+1 are given by\nX\nX\nds1 (\nx\u03c3 v1,\u03c3 \u2227 * * * \u2227 vr,\u03c3 ) =\nx\u03c3\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\nX\n\n\u01eb(\u03c4, \u03c3)v1,\u03c3 \u2227 * * * \u2227 vr,\u03c3\n\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206(s+1)\n\u03c4 \u2264\u03c3\n\nProof. This is a straight forward combination of theorem 4.21 and the computation 3.18.\nFinally, using an idea from [Jor98] which can be traced back to [Tot] that this spectral sequence\ndegenerates rationally.\nTheorem 4.23. The spectral sequence in 4.22 degenerates when tensored with Q.\nProof. Let LH(pt)Q = LH(pt)\u2297Z Q. The toric variety X(\u2206) admits an N-action. Let m \u2208 N,\nthen [m] : X(\u2206) \u2192 X(\u2206) is the morphism which on the open sets X\u03c3 = Spec C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] is\ndefined through the ring homomorphism [m]\u2217 : C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2192 C[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] given by v 7\u2192 mv (see\n[Tot] for details).\nThe N-action on X(\u2206) induces an N-action on the spectral sequence 50. As the rational\nmorphic cohomology of a torus TL = Spec C[L] is\nLH n (TL )Q = \u2227n L \u2297 LH(pt)Q ,\nThe N-action on on the page E1r,s is just multiplication by mr . As the next pages Ekr,s of the\nspectral sequence are subquotients of E1\u2217,\u2217 , the action on those pages is also given by mr . On\nthe other hand the differentials go dk : Ekr,s \u2192 Ekr+1\u2212k,s+k and the N-action commutes with\nthem, so\nmr dk (x) = dk (mr x) = dk ([m]x) = [m]dk (x) = mr+1\u2212k dk (x),\nwhere x \u2208 Ekr,s . Rationally, this forces dk (x) = 0 when k \u2265 2.\nNow let \u03b5 : Top \u2192 qProjC be the morphism of sites, with the usual topology in Top and\nthe Zariski topology on qProjC . Let R\u03b5\u2217 Z be the derived push-forward of the constant sheaf\nZ on Top to the Zariski site qProjC . There is a natural map\nM\u2217 (q) \u2192 R\u03b5\u2217 Z\n\n(51)\n\nM\u2217 (q) \u2192 \u03c4\u2264q R\u03b5\u2217 Z.\n\n(52)\n\nwhich, on smooth varieties, factors as\n\nSee [FHW04] for details.\nThere is the following conjecture, a morphic analogue of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjecture\nin the motivic world.\n\n\f29\n\nReferences\n\nConjecture 4.24 (Suslin). The comparison morphism (51) above is a quasi-isomorphism on\nsmooth varieties.\nThis conjecture is proved for the class of smooth linear varieties (which include smooth toric\nvarieties) in [FHW04] theorem 7.14.\nThe spectral sequence 4.21 has the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.25. The Suslin conjecture holds for projective toric varieties (not necessarily\nsmooth).\nProof. First of all, we have to check that M\u2217 (q) |X(\u2206) is exact above degree q, in order\nto have the factorization (52). This is a local statment on X(\u2206), so we can restrict to an\nopen X\u03c3 . Now the inclusion T\u03c3 \u2192 X\u03c3 is an algebraic homotopy equivalence, and they induce\nisomorphisms on hypercohomology\n\u223c\n\nHn (X\u03c3 , M\u2217 (q)|X ) \u2192 Hn (T\u03c3 , M\u2217 (q)|T\u03c3 ),\nso the natural map M\u2217 (q)|X \u2192 Rj\u03c3\u2217 j\u03c3\u2217 M\u2217 (q)|X is a quasi-isomorphism. As T\u03c3 is smooth, its\ncohomology vanishes above q, and we have the desired factorization.\nNow, \u03c4\u2264q R\u03b5\u2217 Z is a has homotopy invariant cohomology. Then we can apply theorem 4.21 to\nit and get a spectral sequence converging to Hn (X(\u2206), \u03c4\u2264q R\u03b5\u2217 Z). Moreover, the comparison\nmap (52) gives a morphism of spectral sequences\nE1r,s =\n\nHr (T\u03c3 , M\u2217 (q))\n\n+3 Hr+s (X(\u2206), M\u2217 (q))\n\nHr (T\u03c3 , \u03c4\u2264q R\u03b5\u2217 Z)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n+3 Hr+s (X(\u2206), \u03c4\u2264q R\u03b5\u2217 Z)\n\nL\n\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u2032 r,s\n\nE1\n\n=\n\nL\n\n\u03c3\u2208\u2206(s)\n\nwhich is an isomorphism on the first page by the computation 3.18, so it gives an isomorphism\non the abutement, as desired.\n\nReferences\n[DT58]\n\nAlbrecht Dold and Ren\u00e9 Thom.
