INTRODUCTION\n\nMagnetic materials are essential for modern technology. All presently used magnetic materials involve the\nelements belonging to either the d- or the f -block of the\nperiodic table. For instance, among the periodic table elements only the late transition metals Fe, Co and Ni, are\nferromagnets at room temperature. Magnetic ordering in\nthese transition metals originate from the partially filled\nd-electron bands. However, magnetism is not common\nfor the light p-block elements belonging to the second\nperiod of the periodic table, even despite the fact that\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: yazyev@civet.berkeley.edu\n\ncarbon is able to form very diverse and complex molecular structures. In principle, such materials may possess a number of attractive properties such as low density, biocompatibility, plasticity, and many others, which\nstimulates the search for light-element based magnetism\n(Makarova and Palacio, 2006).\nThe field of light-element magnetism and, in particular, of carbon-based magnetism is currently gaining increasing importance because of the following two reasons.\nFirstly, the field of carbon-based magnetism has always\nbeen a very controversial area of research which suffered\nfrom the poor reproducibility of experimental results.\nHowever, the situation seems to be improved over the\nlast few years. Several examples of magnetism in carbonbased materials continue to be reliably reproduced by\ndifferent research groups. The second driving force is the\nfirst isolation of graphene, a truly two-dimensional form\nof carbon which has attracted enormous attention in science and technology (Novoselov et al., 2004). Graphene\nhas a fairly simple honeycomb atomic structure, but\nrather unique electronic structure with linear band dispersion at the Fermi level (see Fig. 1) which is largely\nresponsible for many novel physical phenomena observed\nin this material (for review see (Castro Neto et al., 2009;\nGeim and Novoselov, 2007; Katsnelson, 2007)). Importantly, graphene can also be considered as a unifying\nconcept for understanding a broad class of sp2 carbon\nmaterials which includes polycyclic aromatic molecules,\nfullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphite as well as\ntheir further modifications obtained by patterning, chemical treatment, implantation of defects, impurities, etc.\nWhile ideal graphene is nonmagnetic itself, many its\nderivative materials and nanostructures, both realized in\npractice and considered theoretically, show various scenarios of magnetism. The magnetic graphene nanostructures are particularly promising for applications in the\nfield of spintronics, a very probable future step in the evolution of electronics industry, which promises information\nstorage, processing and communication at faster speeds\nand lower energy consumption (Awschalom and Flatte,\n2007; Chappert et al., 2007; Fert, 2008; Wolf et al.,\n\n\f2\n\na\nA\n\narm\n\nch\n\nair\nB\n\nzigzag\n\nc\n\nb\nEnergy (eV)\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n\u03c3*\n\n\u03c0*\nK\n\n\u03c3\n\nK'\n\n\u03c0\n\n-5\n-10\n-15\n\n\u03c3\nM\n\n\u0393\n\nK\n\nM\n\nFIG. 1 (a) Two-dimensional crystalline lattice of graphene.\nThe shaded area denotes the unit cell of graphene containing two carbon atoms which belong to the two sublattices of\ngraphene, A (empty circle) and B (filled circle). The two\nhigh-symmetry directions of graphene lattice, armchair and\nzigzag, are highlighted. (b) Band structure of graphene obtained by means of first-principles calculations. The bands\nare labeled according to their symmetry. The \u03c0-symmetry\nbands responsible for the low-energy electronic properties of\ngraphene are highlighted. The zero energy corresponds to the\nFermi level. (c) The low-energy part of the band structure\nof graphene involves two inequivalent 'Dirac cone' features\nin the corners (points K and K \u2032 ) of the hexagonal Brillouin\nzone.\n\n2001). While traditional electronics exploits only the\ncharge of electron, spintronics will also make use of its\nspin degree of freedom. For the field of spintronics\ngraphene can offer a possibility of tuning its spin transport properties by means of various applied stimuli. For\ninstance, it was suggested that half-metallicity of zigzag\ngraphene nanoribbons can be triggered by external electric fields (Son et al., 2006b). If realized in practice, this\nwould allow for efficient electric control of spin transport, a very desirable effect which is hard to achieve\nusing other materials. In addition, materials based\nsp-elements are expected to have high magnitudes of\nthe spin-wave stiffness (Edwards and Katsnelson, 2006)\nand, thus, nanostructures made of these elements would\npossess higher Curie temperatures or spin correlation\nlengths (Yazyev and Katsnelson, 2008). Materials based\non light elements also display weak spin-orbit and hyperfine couplings which are the main channels of relaxation\n\nand decoherence of electron spins (Fischer et al., 2009;\nTrauzettel et al., 2007; Yazyev, 2008a). This property\nmakes carbon nanomaterials promising for transport of\nspin-polarized currents and for spin-based quantum information processing.\nThis review provides a brief introduction into the current state of the field of magnetic materials and nanostructures based on graphene. The possible scenarios for\nthe onset of magnetism in graphene nanostructures are\nillustrated by means of a simple theoretical model based\non the mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian. The next section briefly reviews the landmark experimental reports\nin the field. Then follows the introduction of the theoretical model and its specific consequences for describing the electronic structure and magnetic properties of\ngraphene-based materials. The main part of this article applies the theoretical model described and reviews\nboth theoretical and experimental published works on\nmagnetic graphene systems classified according to their\ndimensionality: (1) finite graphene nanofragments, (2)\none-dimensional graphene edges and graphene nanoribbons, and (3) two-dimensional graphene and graphite\nwith magnetism induced by the presence of point defects. Of these three classes, magnetic graphene edges\nand nanoribbons will be covered in more detail since\nthese one-dimensional objects continue to receive special\nattention in the scientific community. Future perspectives of the field are outlined in the last section.\n\nII. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL PROGRESS\n\nThe first reproducible experimental reports of\nmagnetism in p-block compounds were published\nin 1991 when magnetic ordering was observed\nin crystalline p-nitrophenyl nitronyl nitroxide (pNPNN)\n(Takahashi et al.,\n1991;\nTamura et al.,\n1991) and in a charge transfer complex of C60\n\na\n\nb\n\u2212\n\nO\n\nN\n\n+\n\nN\n\nO\n\n+\n\n(H3C)2N\n\nN(CH3)2\n\n(H3C)2N\n\nN(CH3)2\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nO\n\nN\n\n+\n\nO\n\np-NPNN\n\nTDAE-C60\n\nFIG. 2 Chemical structures of (a) p-NPNN and (b) the\nTDAE-C60 charge transfer complex. Molecular crystals of\nthese organic compounds exhibit ferromagnetic ordering with\nCurie temperatures of 0.6 K and 16 K, respectively. Each\nmolecular radical unit bears a single uncompensated electron\nspin. In chemical notation the presence of aunpaired electron\nis usually denoted by a thick dot.\n\n\f3\nand\ntetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene\n(TDAE)\n(Allemand et al., 1991).\nMolecular structures of\nthese organic materials made of light elements only (C,\nH, N and O) are shown in Figure 2. In their molecular\ncrystals the uncompensated electron spins are localized\non weakly coupled molecular units. Because of the\nweak coupling between electron spins, the long-range\nmagnetic order is realized only at low temperatures. The\ntwo organic materials mentioned above, p-NPNN and\nTDAE-C60 , are characterized by Curie temperatures of\n0.6 K and 16 K, respectively. Since 1991 a large number\nof other organic magnetic materials have been examined.\nIn all cases the temperatures below which long-range\nmagnetic order is established (Curie temperatures, TC ,\nand N\u00e9el temperatures, TN , in the case of ferromagnetic\nand antiferromagnetic orderings, respectively) were\nmuch lower than room temperature, which renders such\nmaterials useless for practical applications.\nThe next milestone experiment was reported ten\nyears later when ferromagnetism with TC \u2248 500 K\nwas observed in rhombohedral C60 under high pressure (Makarova et al., 2001). This observation, however,\ndemonstrates very well the controversial character of the\nfield. Five years later several authors retracted the original publication since the measured content of magnetic\nimpurities was shown to be close to the amount needed\nto explain the observed magnetization of the samples\n(Makarova et al., 2006). In addition, the measured TC\nwas found to be very similar to the one of cementite\nFe3 C. The question of possible high-temperature magnetic ordering in C60 -based materials remains open.\nTwo years later room-temperature ferromagnetism\nwas observed in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite\n(HOPG) irradiated with high-energy (2.25 MeV) protons (Esquinazi et al., 2003). Figure 3 shows the magnetization loop for a proton-irradiated sample compared\n\n-6\n\nMagnetic Moment m (10 emu)\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nMagnetic Field (kOe)\n\nFIG. 3 Magnetic moment of proton irradiated (filled circles)\nand untreated (empty squares) graphite as a function applied\nmagnetic field as measured by Esquinazi et al. at T = 300 K.\nThe weak hysteresis loop can be recognized.

Further experimental investigations\nrevealed that the magnetic order in proton-bombarded\ngraphite has two-dimensional, that is, graphene-like character (Barzola-Quiquia et al., 2007) and originates from\nthe carbon \u03c0-electron system rather than from possible d-element impurities (Ohldag et al., 2007). Interestingly, it was shown that the chemical nature of the highenergy particles plays a crucial role in producing magnetic ordering. While proton irradiation leads to the onset of ferromagnetism in irradiated samples, both helium\n(Esquinazi et al., 2003) and iron (Barzola-Quiquia et al.,\n2008) ions show no clear effect. On the other hand, the\nimplantation of carbon ions was also reported to induce\nferromagnetism in HOPG (Xia et al., 2008).\nA number of reports have also pointed out\nthat even untreated graphite exhibit ferromagnetism\n(Esquinazi et al., 2002; Kopelevich et al., 2000). Very\nrecently, by using a combination of scanning probe techniques and magnetization measurements, \u010cervenka and\nco-authors have shown that the intrinsic ferromagnetism\nof graphite is related to the presence of grain boundaries which can be considered as 2D periodic networks of\npoint defects (\u010cervenka et al., 2009). Room-temperature\nmagnetic hysteresis has also been reported for graphene\nsamples produced in bulk quantities from graphite using\nthe chemical approaches (Matte et al., 2009; Wang et al.,\n2009b).\nIII. BASIC COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES\nA. Model Hamiltonians\n\nThe vast majority of computational studies of magnetic carbon nanostructures are currently performed using first-principles electronic structure methods based\non density functional theory (DFT). This approach is\nnow implemented in a large number of public computer\ncodes and well described in a variety of graduate-level\ntextbooks (for instance, see (Koch and Holthausen, 2002;\nMartin, 2004; Marx and Hutter, 2009)). For pedagogical\npurposes, a simpler approach based on model Hamiltonians will be adopted in this review article. Moreover,\nit will be demonstrated below that such simplified models very often allow deeper understanding of the results\nobtained.\nA simple model which is widely used for studying magnetic effects in sp2 carbon materials is the one-orbital\nmean-field Hubbard model. This model considers only\nthe \u03c0-symmetry electronic states which are formed by\nthe unhybridized pz atomic orbitals of sp2 carbon atoms.\nAs shown in Figure 1(b) the low-energy electronic states\nhave \u03c0-symmetry and thus play the dominant role in\nthe properties of graphene systems. The Hubbard model\nHamiltonian can be partitioned into two parts,\nH = H0 + H\u2032 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe first term is the nearest-neighbor tight-binding\n\n\f4\nHamiltonian\nH0 = \u2212t\n\nX\n\n[c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c.],\n\n(2)\n\nhi,ji,\u03c3\n\nin which the operators ci\u03c3 and c\u2020i\u03c3 annihilate and create\nan electron with spin \u03c3 at site i, respectively. The notation h*, *i stands for the pairs of nearest-neighbor atoms;\n'h.c.' is the Hermitian conjugate counterpart. The well\nestablished hopping integral t \u2248 2.7 eV defines the energy scale of the Hamiltonian. This physical model is\nequivalent to the H\u00fcckel method familiar to chemists.\nFrom the computational point of view, the Hamiltonian\nmatrix is determined solely by the atomic structure: the\noff-diagonal matrix elements (i, j) and (j, i) are set to\n\u2212t when atoms i and j are covalently bonded, and to 0\notherwise. In a neutral graphene system each sp2 carbon atom contributes one pz orbital and one \u03c0 electron.\nThe \u03c0-electron system is thus called half-filled. The spectrum of the eigenvalues of tight-binding Hamiltonian matrix exhibit electron-hole symmetry, i.e. it is symmetric\nwith respect to zero energy. In other words, in a neutral\ngraphene system for each eigenvalue \u01eb < 0 corresponding to an occupied (bonding) state, there is an unoccupied (anti-bonding) state with \u01eb\u22c6 = \u2212\u01eb. The states with\n\u01eb = 0 are called zero-energy states (also referred to as\nnon-bonding or midgap states).\nThe nearest-neighbor tight-binding model has proved\nto describe accurately the electronic structure of\ngraphene, carbon nanotubes and other non-magnetic sp2\ncarbon materials. However, electron-electron interactions have to be introduced in some form in order to\ndescribe the onset of magnetism. Within the Hubbard\nmodel these interactions are introduced through the repulsive on-site Coulomb interaction\nX\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 ,\n(3)\nH\u2032 = U\ni\n\nc\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3\n\nwhere ni\u03c3 =\nis the spin-resolved electron density\nat site i; the parameter U > 0 defines the magnitude of\nthe on-site Coulomb repulsion. This model considers only\nthe short-range Coulomb repulsion, that is, two electrons\ninteract only if they occupy the pz atomic orbital of the\nsame atom. Despite its apparent simplicity, this term is\nno longer trivial from the computational point of view.\nThe mean-field approximation\nX\n\u2032\n(ni\u2191 hni\u2193 i + hni\u2191 ini\u2193 \u2212 hni\u2191 ihni\u2193 i) , (4)\nHmf\n=U\ni\n\nallows us to overcome this difficulty. Here, a spin-up\nelectron at site i interacts with the average spin-down\nelectron population hni\u2193 i at the same site, and vice\nversa. This mean-field model represents a variation of the\nunrestricted Hartree-Fock method (Szabo and Ostlund,\n1982). From the computational point of view, the\nelectron-electron interaction term affects only the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian matrix. The diagonal elements of the spin-up and spin-down blocks now\n\ndepend on the unknown hni\u2193 i and hni\u2191 i, respectively.\nThe problem can be solved self-consistently starting from\nsome initial values of hni\u03c3 i which can be chosen randomly. However, one has to keep in mind that in certain\ncases the broken-symmetry (antiferromagnetic) solutions\ncan be obtained only if the initial guess breaks the spinspatial symmetry (Yazyev et al., 2008). The process of\n(1) calculation of the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian\nmatrix, (2) its diagonalization and (3) the computation\nof updated spin densities is then repeated iteratively until\nall values of hni\u03c3 i are converged. The final self-consistent\nsolution provides the spin densities\nMi =\n\nhni\u2191 i \u2212 hni\u2193 i\n,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nat\nP each atom i and the total spin of the system S =\ni Mi . For a given graphene structure both local and\ntotal spins (magnetic moments) depend exclusively on\nthe dimensionless parameter U/t.\nAfter the model has been introduced, the following\nthree critical questions can be asked. (1) Is the oneorbital approximation accurate enough compared to the\nmethods considering all electrons? (2) Which value of\nthe empirical parameter U/t should be used? (3) Is the\nmean-field approximation justified for graphene based\nsystems?\n(1) It has been shown that the results of meanfield Hubbard model calculations correspond closely\nto the ones obtained using first-principles methods if the parameter U/t is chosen appropriately\n(Fern\u00e1ndez-Rossier and Palacios, 2007; Gunlycke et al.,\n2007; Pisani et al., 2007). The first-principles methods either treat all electrons on equal footing or disregard the localized atomic core states which are not important in most cases. One notable exception is the\ncalculation of hyperfine interactions. In this case the\nspin polarization of the 1s atomic core states of carbon atoms has significant contribution to the Fermi contact hyperfine couplings (Yazyev, 2008a; Yazyev et al.,\n2005). Otherwise, the results of DFT calculations performed using a generalized-gradient-approximation family exchange-correlation functional are best reproduced\nwhen U/t \u2248 1.3. The results of the local-spin-density approximation calculations are best fitted using U/t \u2248 0.9\n(Pisani et al., 2007).\n(2) Ideally, the empirical parameter U/t must be estimated using experimental knowledge. Unfortunately,\nthere are no direct experiments performed on magnetic graphene systems which would allow to estimate\nU/t. Magnetic resonance studies of neutral soliton\nstates in trans-polyacetylene, a one-dimensional sp2 carbon polymer which can be viewed as a minimumwidth zigzag graphene nanoribbon, give the range of\nvalues U \u223c 3.0\u22123.5 eV (Kuroda and Shirakawa, 1987;\nThomann et al., 1985). This interval corresponds to\nU/t \u223c 1.1\u22121.3 which also makes us confident in the\nresults of the generalized-gradient-approximation DFT\ncalculations. Increasing U/t leads to the enhancement\n\n\f5\nof magnetic moments. The range of meaningful magnitudes is limited by U/t \u2248 2.23 above which the\nideal graphene undergoes a Mott-Hubbard transition\ninto an antiferromagnetically ordered insulating state\n(Sorella and Tosatti, 1992). In the computational examples considered below a value of U/t = 1.2 will be used.\n(3) This question is the most difficult to answer. A\ncomparison of the mean-field results with the ones obtained using exact diagonalization and quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations illustrates the validity of this approximation for the relevant values of U/t (Feldner et al.,\n2009). Magnetic graphene materials and nanostructures\nneed not be considered as strongly correlated systems.\n\ninstability associated with the presence of low-energy\nelectrons in the system. Other mechanisms, such as the\nPeierls distortion, were shown to be inefficient in the case\nof graphene nanostructures (Pisani et al., 2007).\nAlthough the benzenoid graph theory is able to predict\nthe occurrence of zero-energy states, it is not clear how\nthe electron spins align in these states. The complementary knowledge is supplied by Lieb's theorem (Lieb, 1989)\nwhich determines the total spin of a bipartite system\ndescribed by the Hubbard model. This theorem states\nthat in the case of repulsive electron-electron interactions\n(U > 0), a bipartite system at half-filling has the ground\nstate characterized by the total spin\nS=\n\nB. Counting rules\n\nThere are two important consequences coming from\nthe model Hamiltonians we have introduced. The honeycomb lattice of graphene is a bipartite lattice. That is,\nit can be partitioned into two mutually interconnected\nsublattices A and B (see Fig. 1(a)). Each atom belonging to sublattice A is connected to the atoms in sublattice\nB only, and vice versa. Moreover, the graphene systems\nwhose faces are hexagons are called benzenoid (or honeycomb) systems. Carbon atoms in such systems have\neither three or two nearest neighbors. The class of benzenoid systems is a subclass of bipartite systems.\nThe spectrum of the tight-binding Hamiltonian of a\nhoneycomb system can be analyzed using a mathematically rigorous approach of the benzenoid graph theory (Fajtlowicz et al., 2005). An important result for\nus is that this theory is able to predict the number of\nzero-energy states of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding\nHamiltonian in a 'counting rule' fashion. The number of\nsuch states is equal to the graph's nullity\n\u03b7 = 2\u03b1 \u2212 N,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere N is the total number of sites and \u03b1 is the maximum possible number of non-adjacent sites, i.e. the sites\nwhich are not the nearest neighbors to each other. The\nonset of magnetism in the system is determined by the\nso-called Stoner criterion which refers to the competition of the exchange energy gain and the kinetic-energy\npenalty associated with the spin-polarization of the system (Mohn, 2003). The gain in exchange energy is due to\nthe exchange splitting of the electronic states subjected\nto spin-polarization (Palacios et al., 2008)\nU X 2\n\u2206S = \u01eb\u2191 \u2212 \u01eb\u2193 =\nn ,\n(7)\n2 i i\nP 2\nwhere\ni ni is the inverse participation ratio, a measure of the degree of localization of the corresponding\nelectronic state. The kinetic-energy penalty is proportional to the energy of this state. Thus, the zero-energy\nstates undergo spin-polarization at any U > 0 irrespective of their degree of localization. One can view spinpolarization as one of the mechanisms for escaping an\n\n1\n|NA \u2212 NB |,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere NA and NB are the numbers of sites in sublattices A and B, respectively. The ground state is unique\nand the theorem holds in all dimensions without the necessity of a periodic lattice structure. Importantly, the\ntwo counting rules are linked by the following relation,\n\u03b7 \u2265 |NA \u2212 NB |.\nIn the following section, the application of these two\nsimple counting rules will be demonstrated on small\ngraphene fragments and compared to the results of numerical calculations.\n\nIV. FINITE GRAPHENE FRAGMENTS - A SIMPLE\nILLUSTRATION\n\nLet us first try to understand the origin of magnetism in finite graphene fragments (also referred to as\nnanoflakes, nanoislands or nanodisks) as a function of\ntheir shape and size. Three simple examples of nanometer sized graphene fragments are shown in Figure 4. From\nthe point of view of single-orbital physical models, only\nthe connectivity of the \u03c0-electron conjugation network\nis important. Such \u03c0-systems may constitute only small\nparts of more complex molecules or bulk materials. In\nsimplest case, the \u03c0-electron networks shown in Figure 4\ncan be realized in the corresponding all-benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules with the\nedges of the fragments being passivated by hydrogen\natoms. Each carbon atom at the edge of the fragment\nis bonded to one hydrogen atom such that all carbon\natoms are sp2 -hybridized. Current progress in synthesizing such molecules and understanding their properties\nhas recently been reviewed (Wu et al., 2007).\nThe hexagonal graphene fragment shown in Figure 4(a) is thus equivalent to the coronene molecule. For\nthis fragment, the number of sites belonging to the two\nsublattices is equal, NA = NB = 12. The number of nonadjacent sites is maximized when all atoms belonging to\neither of the two sublattices are selected, i.e. \u03b1 = 12.\nThus, both the number of zero-energy states \u03b7 and the\ntotal spin S are zero. The tight-binding model predicts\na wide band gap of 1.08t \u2248 3.0 eV for this graphene\n\n\f6\nmolecule. As expected, the mean-field Hubbard model\nsolution for this fragment does not reveal any magnetism.\n\na\n\n3\n2\n\nE/t\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n\u03b7=0\nS=0\n\n-3\n\nb\n\n0\n\n0.5\nband filling\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\nband filling\n\n1\n\n3\n2\n\nE/t\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n\u03b7=2\nS=2\n\n-3\n\nc\n\nstates according to Hund's rule, that is, their spins are\noriented parallel to each other. The mean-field Hubbard\nmodel results for this system at half-filling are shown\nin Figure 5(a). One can see that spin-polarization lifts\nthe degeneracy of the zero-energy electronic states and\nopens an energy gap \u2206S = 0.30t \u2248 0.8 eV. The system\nis stabilized by spin-polarization. Most of the spin-up\nelectron density localized on the atoms in sublattice A\n(see Fig. 5(a)) originates from the two electrons populating the non-bonding states. However, one can notice an\nappreciable amount of spin-down density on the atoms\nin sublattice B which is compensated by an equivalent\ncontribution of the spin-up density in sublattice A. The\noccurrence of the induced magnetic moments is a manifestation of the spin-polarization effect which is related\nto the exchange interaction of the fully populated states\nwith the two unpaired electrons.\nThe third bowtie-shaped graphene molecule shown in\nFigure 4(c) is composed of two triangulane fragments\nsharing one hexagon. For this system Lieb's theorem\npredicts the spin-singlet ground state (NA = NB = 19).\nHowever, the choice of the set of atoms which maxi-\n\na\n\n1.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b7=2\nS=0\n\nE/t\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-2\n-3\n\n-1.5\n0.25\n0\n\n0.5\nband filling\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4 Atomic structures and tight-binding energy spectra\nof three graphene fragments: (a) coronene, (b) triangulane,\nand (c) a bowtie-shaped fragment (\"Clar's goblet\").

Dashed line corresponds to the energy spectrum of ideal\ngraphene.\n\nThe second graphene fragment shown in Figure 4(b)\nhas triangular shape. It is not surprising that the corresponding hypothetical PAH molecule is called triangulane. Unlike coronene, the two sublattices of this triangular fragment are no longer equivalent: NA = 12 and\nNB = 10. The unique choice maximizing the number of\nnon-adjacent sites is achieved by selecting the atoms belonging to the dominant sublattice A, i.e. \u03b1 = NA = 12.\nThus, the benzenoid graph theory predicts the presence\nof two zero-energy states on sublattice A. Lieb's theorem\npredicts the S = 1 (spin-triplet) ground state or, equivalently, a magnetic moment of 2 \u03bcB per molecule.

Area of each circle is proportional to\nthe magnitude of the local magnetic moment at each atom.\nFilled (red) and empty (blue) circles correspond to spin-up\nand spin-down densities. Energy levels energies are plotted\nas a function of band filling. Dashed line corresponds to the\nenergy spectrum of ideal graphene.Red and blue levels correspond spin-up and spin-down channels, respectively. In the\ncase of bowtie fragment the energies in the two channels are\nidentical (shown in magenta).\n\n\f7\nmizes the number non-adjacent sites is less evident in\nthis case. Figure 4(c) shows such a selection (\u03b1 = 20)\nwhich involves the atoms belonging to both sublattice A\nand sublattice B in the left and right parts of the structure. These atoms are marked differently in the figure.\nHence, there are \u03b7 = 2 \u00d7 20 \u2212 38 = 2 zero-energy states\nas confirmed by the tight-binding calculation. The zeroenergy states are spatially segregated in the two triangular parts of the molecule (Wang et al., 2009a). To satisfy\nthe spin-singlet ground state, the two zero-energy states\nhave to be populated by two electrons with oppositely\noriented spins. In other words, the ground electronic\nconfiguration breaks spin-spatial symmetry and exhibits\nantiferromagnetic ordering. This result can be verified\nby mean-field Hubbard model calculations as shown in\nFigure 5(b). It can be argued that this example violates\nHund's rule. However, one has to keep in mind that\neach of the two non-bonding states is localized within\none of the graphene sublattices. That is, there are two\nelectronic sub-bands, each populated by electrons according to Hund's rule. The coupling between the electron spins in these two sub-bands is antiferromagnetic\ndue to the superexchange mechanism (Anderson, 1950;\nKramers, 1934).\nThe two counting rules can be applied to larger\ngraphene fragments. It was shown that the total spin\nof triangular fragments with edges cut along the zigzag\ndirection scales linearly with fragment size (Ezawa,\n2007; Fern\u00e1ndez-Rossier and Palacios, 2007; Wang et al.,\n2008a) as illustrated in Figure 6. The average magnetic\nmoment per carbon atom thus decays with increasing the\nsystem size. The evolution of magnetic properties with\nincreasing size for hexagonal fragments with edges cut\nalong the same zigzag direction is less trivial. It has been\nshown theoretically that above some critical size the system undergoes a transition into a broken-symmetry antiferromagnetic state (Fern\u00e1ndez-Rossier and Palacios,\n2007). The critical size itself depends strongly on the\nvalue of U/t. However, it is easier to explain the origin of this behavior in large systems from the standpoint\nof edge magnetism, which will be explained in the next\nsection.\nFinally, a few words have to be said about the possibility of realizing in practice the magnetic graphene fragments we have discussed. It is expected that such magnetic systems are more reactive than the non-magnetic\npolyaromatic molecules.

The spintriplet ground state of these chemical compounds was\nverified by the electron spin resonance measurements.\nIn principle, this example can be considered as an indirect proof of edge magnetism in graphene systems, at\nleast in finite fragments produced by means of the chemical bottom-up approach. The synthesized triangulane\nderivatives are reactive molecules, but nevertheless can\nbe handled in common organic solvents and stored for\nmany months at room temperature provided the solution is isolated from atmospheric oxygen (Allinson et al.,\n1995). Larger magnetic triangular molecules have not\nbeen synthesized so far. The PAH molecule corresponding to the considered bowtie fragment was hypothesized\nby Eric Clar and named \"Clar's goblet\" after him (Clar,\n1972). Attempts to synthesize this molecule have failed\n(Clar and Mackay, 1972).\nThe examples shown above illustrate how three different magnetic scenarios can be realized in very simple finite graphene systems. These examples also provide a way for designing nanostructures with predefined\nmagnetic interactions, a highly useful tool for developing\nnovel spintronic devices. The value of this approach has\nalready been demonstrated by the proposal of reconfigurable spintronic logic gates exploiting the strong antiferromagnetic couplings in the bowtie-shaped graphene\nfragments (Wang et al., 2009a). Several devices for controlling spin-currents based on triagular graphene fragments have also been described recently (Ezawa, 2009b).\nA number of other intriguing properties predicted for\nzero-dimensional graphene fragments are potentially interesting from both fundamental and applied points of\nview (Akola et al., 2008; Ezawa, 2008, 2009a).\n\nV.

Strictly speaking,\nthe flat band does not correspond to zero-energy states,\nbut rather to the states with energies the approach zero\nwith increasing nanoribbon width. The low-energy states\nare localized at the edge and decay quickly in the bulk.\nHigh density of low-energy electronic states suggests a\npossibility of magnetic ordering. Indeed, the mean-field\nHubbard model solution for this system reveals magnetic moments localized at the edges as shown in Figure 9(a). The localized magnetic moments display ferromagnetic ordering along the zigzag edge while the mutual orientation of the magnetic moments localized at the\nopposite edges is antiparallel (Fern\u00e1ndez-Rossier, 2008;\nFujita et al., 1996; Son et al., 2006b). Thus, the net magnetic moment of a zigzag nanoribbon is zero in agreement\nwith Lieb's theorem (NA = NB ). The band structure\ncorresponding to the mean-field Hubbard model solution\nis compared to the tight-binding band structure in Figure 9(b).

An alternative approach considers\nthe effects of edges of graphene nanostructures which\ncan be conveniently modeled using one-dimensional periodic strips of graphene. Such models are commonly\nreferred to as graphene nanoribbons. There are two\nhigh-symmetry crystallographic directions in graphene,\narmchair and zigzag, as shown in Figure 1(a). Cutting\ngraphene nanoribbons along these directions produces\narmchair and zigzag nanoribbons, respectively (Fig. 8).\nThe band structures of armchair and zigzag nanoribbons are remarkably different. Figure 8(a) shows the\ntight-binding band structure of a \u223c1.5 nm wide armchair nanoribbon. For this particular armchair graphene\nnanoribbon, introducing a pair of parallel armchair edges\nopens a gap of 0.26t. The nearest-neighbor tightbinding model predicts either metallic or semiconducting behavior for armchair nanoribbons (Barone et al.,\n2006; Brey et al., 2007; Ezawa, 2006; Nakada et al., 1996;\nPeres et al., 2006; Son et al., 2006a), and the two situations alternate as the nanoribbon's width increases. The\nband gap of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons decreases with increasing width. In the case of metallic\nnanoribbons two bands cross the Fermi level at the \u0393\npoint. No magnetic ordering is predicted in this case.\nWithin the same model all zigzag graphene nanoribbons are metallic and feature a flat band extending\nover one-third of the one-dimensional Brillouin zone at\nk \u2208 (2\u03c0/3a; \u03c0/a) (a = 0.25 nm is the unit cell of the\n\nS\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n\u0393\n\n-1\nX\n\n\u0393\n\nX\n\nFIG. 9 (a) Local magnetic moments in a zigzag graphene\nnanoribbon calculated using the mean-field Hubbard model\n(U/t = 1.2).

The spin-polarization almost does not\naffect the electronic states at higher energies. The band\nstructures for the two spin channels are equivalent, but\nspin-spatial symmetry is broken.\nThe coupling between the magnetic edges can be ascribed to the superexchange mechanism as in the case\nof bowtie graphene fragment considered in the previous\nsection. The magnitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling shows a w\u22122 dependence as a function of nanoribbon width w (Jung et al., 2009). The interedge magnetic coupling strength of \u223c25 meV has been calculated from first principles for a \u223c1.5 nm wide nanoribbon (Pisani et al., 2007). Unlike the antiferromagnetic\nground state, a zigzag graphene nanoribbon with ferromagnetic interedge orientation is a metal with two bands\ncrossing the Fermi level at k \u2248 2\u03c0/3a (Fig. 9(c)). The\npossibility of switching between the two states was exploited in a proposal of a graphene-based magnetic sensor\n(Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al., 2009) described in the next section.\nThe coupling between the magnetic moments localized at\nthe edges can be controlled by means of either electron\nor hole doping of the nanoribbons (Jung and MacDonald,\n2009; Sawada et al., 2009). High doping levels eventually\nsuppress magnetism since the flat band shifts away from\n\na\n\nthe Fermi level, thus eliminating the electronic instability associated with the presence of low-energy electrons\n(Jung and MacDonald, 2009).\nIt is worth mentioning that at the time this review was\nwritten, no direct proof of edge magnetism in graphene\nhas been reported. However, the presence of localized low-energy states at zigzag edges of graphene has\nbeen verified by means of scanning tunneling microscopy\n(Kobayashi et al., 2006, 2005).\n\nB. Possible applications in spintronics\n\nIt has been realized that the intriguing magnetic properties of graphene nanostructures may find applications\nin spintronics. The pioneering idea was introduced by\nSon, Cohen and Louie, who have predicted that external\nelectric fields induce half-metallicity in zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons (Son et al., 2006b). The half-metallicity\nrefers to the coexistence of a metallic state for electrons\nwith one spin orientation and an insulating state for electrons with the opposite spin orientation. An electric\nfield is applied across the nanoribbon as shown in Figure 11(a). At zero field the system is characterized by the\nenergy gap \u2206S for the spin-polarized states localized at\nboth edges (Fig. 11(b)).

The direction of the applied electric field defines the spin channel with metallic\nconductivity. If realized in practice, this simple device\nwould offer efficient electrical control of spin transport \u2013\na highly desirable component for spintronics.\nIn addition to the device described, several other approaches for controlling the spin transport in graphene\nnanostructures have been proposed. One of them exploits disorder for achieving the goal; an example from\n(Wimmer et al., 2008) is shown in Figure 12. Electric\ncurrent flowing along the edges of zigzag nanoribbon injects spin-polarized electrons into a graphene reservoir\n(Fig. 12(a)). However, the net spin-polarization of the\ncurrent is zero due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between the two equivalent edges. Then, an extended defect is introduced into one of the edges as shown in Figure 12(b). The defect both quenches magnetic moments\nand scatters the carriers at the rough edge. However,\nconduction at the opposite edge remains unaffected, thus\nallowing for injecting a current with a net spin polarization. Other proposals based on defect and impurity engineering of spin transport in graphene nanoribbons have\nbeen reported (Cantele et al., 2009; Lakshmi et al., 2009;\nPark et al., 2009; Rocha et al., 2009).\nMagnetic graphene nanostructures were also proposed\nas components of magnetoresistive junctions. Such devices are currently used as magnetic field sensors, e.g.\nin the read heads of hard disk drives. Typical magnetoresistive junctions involve ferromagnetic metal layers\nseparated by a nonmagnetic spacer layers, e.g. Co layers\nseparated by a non-magnetic Cu layer, or bcc Fe layers\nseparated by a few-nanometers thick layer of crystalline\nMgO. A crucial characteristic of such spintronic devices\nis their magnetoresistance ratio (MR) which shows the\nchange in electric resistance as a function of the relative orientation of the magnetization of two ferromagnetic layers (Heiliger et al., 2006). This quantity can be\ndefined as\nMR =\n\nRAP \u2212 RP\n\u00d7 100%,\nmin(RP , RAP )\n\n(9)\n\nFIG. 13 Scheme of magnetoresistive device based on zigzag\ngraphene nanoribbon connecting two ferromagnetic contacts\n(Kim and Kim, 2008). The low-resistance configuration (a)\nand the high-resistance configuration (b) of the device correspond to parallel and antiparallel orientations of the magnetic\nmoments of the two ferromagnetic leads, respectively. Arrows\ndenote the magnetic moments of both graphene edges and ferromagnetic leads.\n\nwhere RP and RAP are the resistances for parallel and antiparallel relative orientations of the magnetic moments\nof the layers. Magnetoresistive devices with high magnitudes of MR are demanded by the future nanoscale\nelectronics. It has been predicted that a zigzag graphene\nnanoribbon placed between two ferromagnetic contacts\nconstitutes a magnetoresistive junction with very high\nvalues of magnetoresistance ratio (Kim and Kim, 2008).\nThe low-resistance state of the proposed device corresponds to the parallel configuration in which the magnetic moments at graphene edges are coupled ferromagnetically to each other. The ferromagnetic coupling is\nenforced by the strong interaction with the magnetic\nmoments of ferromagnetic contacts (Fig. 13(a)). In\nthe antiparallel configuration (Fig. 13(b)), the magnetic\ngraphene nanoribbon develops a domain-wall arrangement of edge spins with high resistance. It is worth mentioning that spin-transport measurements in micrometerscale lateral graphene devices contacted by ferromagnetic electrodes have been carried out experimentally\n(Hill et al., 2006; Jozsa et al., 2008; Tombros et al., 2007,\n2008). However, the magnetoresistance effect observed in\nthese experiments is due to the long spin-diffusion lengths\nin graphene.\nAn all-graphene device based on the armchair-zigzagarmchair nanoribbon junction has also been predicted\nto show magnetoresistance effect (Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al.,\n2009). In zero applied magnetic field the magnetic coupling between the opposite zigzag edge segments is antiferromagnetic (Fig. 14(a)) and, hence, electric resistance is high due to the gapped electronic state. Sufficiently strong magnetic fields favor the parallel config-\n\n\f11\n\na\n\narmchair\nzigz\n\nag\n\nb\n\narmchair\n\n(Reina et al., 2009).\nConsiderable progress has also been achieved in controlled manufacturing of graphene nanostructures. The\nlithographic patterning allows to produce graphene\nnanoribbons as narrow as \u223c15 nm (Han et al., 2007).\nSub-10-nanometer graphene nanoribbons have been synthesized using a variety of chemical approaches starting\nfrom either graphite (Li et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008b)\nor carbon nanotubes (Jiao et al., 2009; Kosynkin et al.,\n2009). Well-ordered edges along a single crystallographic\ndirection of graphene have been produced by means\nof chemical vapor deposition (Campos-Delgado et al.,\n2008), annealing by Joule heating (Jia et al., 2009), and\nanisotropic etching of graphene using metallic nanoparticles (Campos et al., 2009).\nC. Magnetic ordering at finite temperatures\n\nFIG. 14 All-graphene magnetoresistive device proposed\nin (Mu\u00f1oz-Rojas et al., 2009). The device represents an\narmchair-zigzag-armchair nanoribbon junction. The highresistance antiparallel configuration (a) switches into a lowresistance parallel configuration (b) in a strong enough applied magnetic field.\n\nuration (Fig. 14(b)) which shows a lower resistance due\nto the spin-polarized edge states crossing the Fermi level\n(Fig. 9(c)). This ultrasmall device thus acts a magnetic\nfield sensor capable to detect magnetic fields from few\nhundreds of Gauss to several Tesla at low temperatures.\nEpitaxial graphene and the isostructural hexagonal\nboron nitride (h-BN) have been proposed as efficient ultrathin non-magnetic spacers for traditional multilayer\nmagnetoresistive junctions (Karpan et al., 2007, 2008;\nYazyev and Pasquarello, 2009). Unlike in the device\nshown in Fig. 13, mono- or multilayers of graphene or\nh-BN are sandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers. The transport direction is orthogonal to the plane\nof spacer layers. The key to feasibility of such devices is the fact that the lattice constants of graphene\nand h-BN match closely those of Co and Ni. Moreover, in the case of multilayer graphene the momentum selection criteria allow efficient transport only for\nthe minority-spin channel in the parallel configuration\nof the device. Very high magnetoresistance ratios have\nbeen predicted for multilayer graphene used as a spacer\nmaterial (Karpan et al., 2007, 2008). Meanwhile, highquality epitaxial monolayers of both graphene and h-BN\non ferromagnetic transition metals have been grown experimentally using the chemical vapor deposition techniques (Dedkov et al., 2008a,b; Gruneis and Vyalikh,\n2008; Oshima and Nagashima, 1997; Rader et al., 2009;\nVarykhalov and Rader, 2009; Varykhalov et al., 2008).\nSuccessful growth of lower-quality multilayer graphene\non polycrystalline Ni substrates has also been reported\n\nIt has already been mentioned at the beginning\nthat the Curie temperatures of ferromagnetic materials must be higher than the operation temperature of\nthe device, which is typically supposed to be close\nto 300 K. When introducing the working principles\nof the proposed spintronic devices based on graphene\nedges, temperature-related limitations were not discussed. However, magnetic order in low-dimensional systems is particularly sensible to thermal fluctuations. In\nparticular, the Mermin-Wagner theorem excludes longrange order in one-dimensional magnetic systems (such\nas the magnetic graphene edges) at any finite temperature (Mermin and Wagner, 1966). The range of magnetic\norder is limited by the temperature-dependent spin correlation lengths \u03be \u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y, z) which define the decay\nlaw of the spin correlation\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03b1\nh\u015d\u03b1\ni \u015di+l i = h\u015di \u015di iexp(\u2212l/\u03be ),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u015d\u03b1\ni are the components of magnetic moment unit\nvector \u015di at site i. In principle, the spin correlation length\nimposes the limitations on the device dimensions. In\norder to establish this parameter one has to determine\nthe energetics of the spin fluctuations contributing to the\nbreakdown of the ordered ground-state configuration.\nThe energetics of the transverse and longitudinal spin excitations (Figs. 15(a),(b)) have been\nexplored using density-functional-theory calculations\n(Yazyev and Katsnelson, 2008). The magnetic correlation parameters in the presence of spin-wave fluctuations, the dominant type of spin disorder in this case,\nwere obtained with the help of one-dimensional Heisenberg model Hamiltonian\nX\nX\n\u015dzi \u015dzi+1 ,\n(11)\n\u015di \u015di+1 \u2212 d\nH = \u2212a\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere the Heisenberg coupling a = 2\u03ba/a2z = 105 meV\ncorresponds to the spin-wave stiffness \u03ba = 320 meV \u00c52\ncalculated from first principles.

This simple model\nHamiltonian has known analytic solutions (Joyce, 1967).\nFigure 15(c) shows the spin correlation lengths calculated\nfor our particular case. Above the crossover temperature\nTx \u2248 10 K, weak magnetic anisotropy does not play any\nrole and the spin correlation length \u03be \u221d T \u22121 . However,\nbelow Tx the spin correlation length grows exponentially\nwith decreasing temperature. At T = 300 K the spin\ncorrelation length \u03be \u2248 1 nm.\nFrom a practical point of view, this means that the\ndimensions of spintronic devices based on the magnetic\nzigzag edges of graphene and operating at normal temperature conditions are limited to several nanometers.\nAt present, such dimensions are very difficult to achieve,\nwhich can be regarded as a pessimistic conclusion. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that the spin stiffness\npredicted for the magnetic graphene edges is still higher\nthan the typical values for traditional magnetic materials. That is, graphene outperforms d-element based\nmagnetic materials, and there is a room for improvement.\nAchieving control over the magnetic anisotropy d/a could\npossibly raise the crossover temperature Tx above 300 K\nand thus significantly extend \u03be. Possible approaches for\n\nExperimental observations of ferromagnetic ordering\nin irradiated graphite have already been mentioned in\nthe introductory part of this review. These results are\nparticularly exciting because of the fact that the induced\nmagnetic ordering is stable at room temperature and well\nabove. Let us now try to understand the origin of magnetism in irradiated graphite. The present section covers the cases of both graphene and graphite which has a\nthree-dimensional crystalline lattice composed of weakly\ncoupled graphene layers.\nThe basic picture of the radiation damage process\nin carbon materials is relatively simple. Irradiation of\ngraphite with high-energy particles (e.g. protons) produces several types of point defects. In carbon materials\nthe defects are created as a result of so-called \"knock-on\ncollisions\" (Banhart, 1999; Krasheninnikov and Banhart,\n2007). This process involves the direct transfer of kinetic energy from the high-energy incident particles to\nthe individual atoms in material's lattice. If the transferred energy is larger than the displacement threshold\nTd , the recoil atom may leave its equilibrium position\nleading to the formation of a pair of point defects \u2013\na vacancy defect and an interstitial. The structure of\nthe vacancy defect in graphene and graphite is shown\nin Figure 16(a). In graphene the interstitial defects\nhave a bridge structure (Lehtinen et al., 2003), while in\ngraphite the stable configuration corresponds to a carbon atom trapped between the adjacent graphene layers (Li et al., 2005; Telling et al., 2003) as shown in Figures 16(b). The displacement threshold Td for carbon\natoms in graphitic materials was found to be \u223c20 eV in a\nnumber of studies (Crespi et al., 1996; Smith and Luzzi,\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\nH\n\nDB\n\nvacancy\n\ninterstitial\n\nhydrogen\nchemisorption\n\nFIG. 16 Atomic structures of primary point defects produced upon irradiating graphite by high-energy protons: (a)\nsingle-atom vacancy, (b) interstitial bridging the neighboring\ngraphene layers, and (c) hydrogen chemisorption. The dangling bond (DB) of the reconstructed vacancy defect and the\nchemisorbed hydrogen atom (H) are labeled.\n\n\f13\nThis result has been widely confirmed using both firstprinciples (Duplock et al., 2004; Lehtinen et al., 2004;\nYazyev and Helm, 2007) and mean-field Hubbard model\n(Kumazaki and Hirashima, 2007; Palacios et al., 2008)\ncalculations.\nFigure 17(a) shows the spin-resolved\ndensity-of-states plots for hydrogen chemisorption and\nvacancy defects obtained using first-principles calculations (Yazyev and Helm, 2007). In the first case, the\nsharp peak close to the Fermi level corresponds to the\nquasi-localized state induced by the chemisorbed hydrogen atom. The peak is fully split by exchange and the system is characterized by a magnetic moment of 1\u03bcB at any\ndefect concentration. The distribution of\u221aspin \u221adensity\naround the defective site clearly shows a 3 \u00d7 3R30\u25e6\nsuperstructure (Fig. 17(b)). The case of vacancy defect\nis somewhat more complicated. In addition to the quasilocalized state, there is also a localized non-bonding state\ndue to the presence of a \u03c3-symmetry dangling bond in\n\na\n\nhydrogen chemisorption\n\nvacancy\n\nDB\n\nQL\n\nDOS (arb. units)\n\n2001; Yazyev et al., 2007; Zobelli et al., 2007). Creation of defects due to electron stopping, i.e. the process involving possible electronic excitations and ionization of individual atoms, is less important in carbon materials since electronic excitations in metals\nare delocalized and quench instantly (Banhart, 1999;\nKrasheninnikov and Banhart, 2007).\nAfter slowing down, reactive particles may also produce chemisorption defects. In particular, protons are\nable to bind to individual carbon atoms in graphene lattice resulting in their rehybridization into the sp3 -state\n(Fig. 16(c)). Such defects are referred to as hydrogen\nchemisorption defects. From the point of view of oneorbital models that we use in our review, both vacancy\nand hydrogen chemisorption defects are equivalent. In\nboth cases a defect removes one pz -orbital from the \u03c0system of graphene. In the first case, the pz -orbital is\neliminated together with the knocked-out carbon atom.\nThe hydrogen chemisorption does not remove the carbon\natom from the crystalline lattice, but once rehybridized\nthe atom is unable to contribute its pz -orbital to the \u03c0electron system. These two types of defects are further\nreferred to as pz -vacancies.\nThe defects described above are the primary defects\nin the radiation-damage process. More complex defects\ncan be produced at later stages of the process. For instance, single-atom vacancies and interstitials may aggregate producing extended defects. Complexes involving\ntwo or more different defects can also be formed upon\nirradiation. Examples are complexes of hydrogen with\nvacancies and interstitials (Lehtinen et al., 2004), and\nintimate Frenkel pairs (Ewels et al., 2003; Yazyev et al.,\n2007). Radiation damage in graphitic materials may also\nproduce the Stone-Wales defects (Kaxiras and Pandey,\n1988; Stone and Wales, 1986).\n\nQL\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\nE (eV)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\nE (eV)\n\n1\n\n2\n\nb\n\nB. Defect-induced magnetism in graphene\n\nThe single atom pz -vacancies described above have a\nparticularly profound effect on the electronic structure of\nideal graphene. Let us consider a periodically repeated\nsupercell of graphene composed of 2N (NA = NB = N )\ncarbon atoms. Elimination of one atom from sublattice A\nintroduces a zero-energy state in the complementary sublattice (\u03b1 = NB ; thus \u03b7 = 2NB \u2212 ((NA \u2212 1) + NB ) = 1).\nSuch zero-energy states extending over large distances\nare called quasi-localized states since they show a powerlaw decay (Huang et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2006). The\nquasi-localized states have been observed in a large number of scanning tunneling\n(STM) studies of\n\u221a microscopy\n\u221a\ngraphite as triangular 3 \u00d7 3R30\u25e6 superstructures extending over a few nanometers and localized around point\ndefects (Kelly and Halas, 1998; Mizes and Foster, 1989;\nRuffieux et al., 2000). For the single-defect model we\nhave adopted, Lieb's theorem predicts a magnetic moment of |(NA \u2212 1) + NB | = 1\u03bcB per supercell, that is, the\npresence of a defect induces ferromagnetic ordering.\n\nFIG. 17 (a) Spin-resolved density of states (DOS) for the\nvacancy and the hydrogen chemisorption defect in graphene\ncalculated from first principles.

The dangling-bond state shows a\nvery strong exchange splitting and contributes 1\u03bcB to the\ntotal magnetic moment of the defect (Fig. 17(a)). However, the magnetic moment due to the quasi-localized\nstate is partially suppressed in this case due to the selfdoping effect related to the structural reconstruction of\nthe vacancy (Yazyev and Helm, 2007). The overall magnetic moment per vacancy defect varies from 1.12\u03bcB to\n1.53\u03bcB for defect concentrations ranging from 20% to\n0.5%.\nMagnetic moments due to dangling bonds can\nalso be contributed by other types of defects, e.g.\nthe bridge-configuration interstitial defect in graphene\n(Lehtinen et al., 2003). However, one has to keep in\nmind that magnetic ordering due to only localized magnetic moments in graphene-based system is improbable\nat high temperatures. The Ruderman-Kittel-KasuyaYoshida interaction is expected to be weak in this\ncase due to the semi-metallic electronic structure of\ngraphene (Brey and Fertig, 2006; Dugaev et al., 2006;\nSaremi, 2007; Vozmediano et al., 2005). On the other\nhand, magnetic ordering due to the quasi-localized states\ncan be considered as itinerant magnetism without excluding a possible contribution of dangling-bond magnetic\nmoments to the net magnetic moment of a defective carbon system.\nThe system with one defect placed in a periodically\nrepeated supercell is only a rough model of disordered\ngraphene for two reasons. First, all defects are located\nin the same sublattice of the graphene layer. Second, the\ndefects form an ordered periodic superlattice. A more\nrealistic description of disorder can be achieved by constructing models with defects randomly distributed in\na large enough supercell (Yazyev, 2008b). Such models allow defects to occupy both sublattices at arbitrary\nconcentrations and eliminate any short-range order in\nthe spatial arrangement of defects. Larger supercells are\nneeded for building the disordered models which makes\nfirst-principles calculations impractical. However, such\nsystem can still be treated using the mean-field Hubbard\nmodel calculations.\nFigure 18(a) shows the distribution of spin density in\na selected region of a large supercell randomly populated by pz -vacancies. Defects in different sublattices\nare shown as black triangles of different orientations.\nThe resulting picture can be explained if one considers\nthe following two arguments. First, from Lieb's theorem the total magnetic per supercell is M = |NA \u2212\nNB | = |NBd \u2212 NAd |, where NAd and NBd are the numbers of defects created in sublattices A and B, respectively. This means that electron spins populating the\nquasi-localized states in the same sublattice are oriented\nparallel to each other while the antiparallel arrangement\nis realized when electron spins populate different sublattices. This conclusion is qualitatively the same as\nthe one we obtained when considering finite graphene\nnanofragments. Second, quasi-localized states populating complementary sublattices interact with each other\n\n\u3008 MA\u3009 (N Ad =N Bd )\n\u3008 MB\u3009 (N Ad =N Bd )\n\u3008 MA\u3009 (N Ad =0)\n\u3008 MB\u3009 (N Ad =0)\n\u3008 MA\u3009+\u3008 MB\u3009 (N Ad =0)\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 18 (a) Distribution of local magnetic moments Mi in\na small region a system with random distribution of pz vacancies obtained thought the mean-field Hubbard model\ncalculations. Positions of defects belonging to sublattices A\nand B are marked by N and H, respectively. (b) Average\nmagnetic moments for the atoms in sublattice A (\u25bd,H) and\nsublattice B (\u25b3,N) as a function of defect concentration x.\nThe defects are either distributed equally between the two\nsublattices (solid curves/filled symbols) or belong to sublattice B only (dashed curves/empty symbols). Net magnetic\nmoments per carbon atom (dashed line) is shown for the case\nof defects distributed over sublattice B only.\n\n(Kumazaki and Hirashima, 2007; Palacios et al., 2008).\nThe interaction lifts the degeneracy leading to weakly\nbonding and anti-bonding states. This provides another\nmechanism for escaping the instability associated with\nthe presence of low-energy electronic states. The interaction strength between two defects increases with\ndecreasing distance between them. For very short distances, the gain in exchange energy does not compensate for the kinetic energy penalty due to the splitting.\nThis leads to quenching of the defect-induced magnetic\nmoments (Boukhvalov et al., 2008; Yazyev, 2008b). The\ncompetition between these effects is demonstrated in Figure 18(a).\nMore quantitative results are presented in Figure 18(b)\nwhich shows the mean magnetic moment hM A i and\nhM B i per carbon atom in sublattice A and sublattice B\nas a function of defect concentration x (Yazyev, 2008b).\n\n\f15\nThe resulting values have been averaged over many random placements of defects in the simulation supercell.\nThe plot refers to the situation of defects equally distributed over the two sublattices (NAd = NBd ) and to\nthe situation when defects belong to sublattice B only\n(NAd = 0). In the first case, the magnetic moments in the\ntwo sublattices compensate each other. The overall magnetic ordering is of antiferromagnetic character. When\ndefects populate only one sublattice the system exhibits\nferromagnetic ordering. The net magnetic moment per\ncarbon atom hM i = (hM A i + hM B i)/2 = x/2 scales\nlinearly with the defect concentration. Both numerical\nresults are in full agreement with Lieb's theorem.\n\nC. Magnetism in graphite and multilayer graphene\n\nExperimental observations of ferromagnetism in irradiated graphite point to the conclusion that sublattices\nof individual graphene layers in bulk graphite are populated by defects differently: that is, there must be a\nmechanism which makes the sublattices of graphene inequivalent. Such an intrinsic discriminating mechanism\nwas ascribed to the stacking order of graphite layers in\nbulk graphite (Yazyev, 2008b). The lowest-energy ABA\nstacking order of individual graphene sheets in graphite\nbreaks the equivalence of the two sublattices as shown in\nFigure 19(a). In fact, only local ABA stacking order is\nrequired to discriminate between the two sublattices of\nthe middle sheet. The mechanism can be demonstrated\nfor the case of hydrogen chemisorption defects. Firstprinciples calculations show that the configuration which\ninvolves hydrogen chemisorbed on sublattice B is 0.16 eV\nlower in energy than on sublattice A (see Figs. 19(b) and\n19(c)). This energy difference is sufficient to trigger a\nconsiderable difference in equilibrium populations of the\ntwo sublattices. The energy barrier for the hopping of\nchemisorbed hydrogen atoms is relatively small (\u223c1 eV)\n\nc\n\na\nA\n\nB'\n\n1.23 eV\n1.04 eV\n\n1.08 eV\n\nB A'\n\nto allow for thermally activated diffusion at mild temperatures.\nSimilar discriminating mechanisms may also exist for\nthe other types of defects created by irradiation, e.g. for\nvacancies. Cross-sections for momentum transfer during knock-on collisions with high-energy incident particles are likely to be very similar for both A and B carbon atoms in graphite. However, the stacking order may\nhave a strong influence on the recombination of interstitial and vacancy defects close to equilibrium conditions.\nIt was also shown that instantaneous recombination of\nlow-energy recoil atoms in graphite is significantly more\nprobable for atoms in position A (Yazyev et al., 2007).\nThat is, more vacancies in sublattice B are left assuming an equal number of knock-on collisions involving the\natoms of both types. These results allow us to conclude\nthat the most probable physical picture of magnetic order\nin irradiated graphite is ferrimagnetism. The magnetic\nmoment induced by defects in sublattice A is larger than\nthe one induced in sublattice B.\nIt is worth mentioning other possible scenarios for the\nonset of magnetism in graphene-related materials and\nnanostructures. It was shown that local negative Gauss\ncurvatures in graphene layers also lead to localized magnetic moments (Park et al., 2003). Coupling between the\ntwo graphene layers in a biased graphene bilayer introduces a pair of sharp van Hove singularities close to the\nFermi level. It was shown theoretically that in a range\nof conditions biased bilayer graphene satisfies the Stoner\ncriterion leading to a low-density ferromagnetic phase\n(Castro et al., 2008).\nThe question of magnetic ordering in defective\ngraphene and graphite at finite temperatures remains\nlargely unaddressed. Similarly to the one-dimensional\nsystem discussed above, an isotropic two-dimensional\nsystem cannot develop long-range magnetic ordering\nat any finite temperature (Mermin and Wagner, 1966).\nHowever, the introduction of a small magnetic anisotropy\nd/a \u223c 10\u22123 already leads to very high transition temperatures (Barzola-Quiquia et al., 2007). Weak magnetic\ncoupling between the individual layers in graphite also\nproduces a pronounced effect on the magnetic transition\ntemperature (Pisani et al., 2008).\n\n0.69 eV\n\nb\n\nB'\n\nA'\n\nVII.

Beyond these theoretical considerations the field of carbon-based magnetism\nfaces a number of challenges. The most important problems are related to the experimental side of the field. In\nparticular, the physics of magnetic graphene edges has\nalready attracted a large number of computational and\ntheoretical researchers. However, no direct experimental evidence has been reported at the time this review\nwas written. Further progress in this field will also re-\n\n\f16\nquire novel manufacturing techniques which would allow\ncontrol of the edge configuration with truly atomic precision. The area of defect-induced magnetism in graphite\ndemands detailed studies of defects produced upon irradiation and their role in the onset of ferromagnetic ordering. The limits of saturation magnetization and Curie\ntemperature in irradiated graphite have still to be established. On the theory side of this field, an understanding\nof magnetic phase transitions in graphene materials and\nnanostructures has to be developed. Other important\ndirections of theoretical research include spin transport\nand magnetic anisotropy of carbon-based systems.\nVIII. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI would like to thank J.
