The presence of these large\nquantities of dust at such early epoch when the universe was .1 Gyr old, suggests the\nrapid enrichment with dust that formed in the explosive ejecta of short-lived massive stars\n(Morgan & Edmunds 2003, Maiolino et al. 2004b; Dwek et al. 2007). In addition, Maiolino\net al. (2004a) have reported that the dust extinction curve of the broad absorption line\nquasar SDSS1048+46 at z = 6.2 is quite different than those of quasars at z < 4, suggesting\ndifferent dust sources and evolutionary histories.\nDust plays a pivotal role in the interstellar processes that determine the state of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Dust affects the thermal and chemical balance of the ISM by\nreprocessing the radiative outputs from stars, providing photoelectrons that heat the gas,\nand depleting the gas of refractory elements that are important cooling agents of the ISM.\nDust also serves as a catalyst for chemical reactions, especially the formation of H2 molecules\non the surface of dust grains (Hirashita & Ferrara 2002; Cazaux & Spaans 2004). In addition,\nthe cooling of gas through thermal radiation from dust triggers the fragmentation of starforming cloud into low-mass gas clumps of \u223c0.1\u20131 M\u2299 even for the metallicity of 10\u22126 \u201310\u22125\nZ\u2299 (Omukai et al. 2005; Schneider et al. 2006), although very massive stars of &100 M\u2299 are\nconsidered to be formed up to Z \u2243 10\u22123.5 Z\u2299 without the effect of dust (Bromm et al. 2001).\nFinally, dust obscures the nature of underlying stellar populations (e.g., Hines et al. 2006)\nand physical processes in the early universe. Understanding the origin and the complex\nevolutionary history of dust is therefore one of the most important goals in astrophysics.\nDuring the first Gyr of cosmic history, supernovae (SNe) are the only possible source\nof interstellar dust, since low mass stars have not had time to evolve off the main sequence\nand inject the dust that forms in their quiescent outflows into the ISM. Theoretical studies\naimed at determining the composition and yield of dust in the ejecta of primordial Type II\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nSNe (SNe II) and pair-instability SNe (PISNe) were conducted by Todini & Ferrara (2001),\nNozawa et al. (2003), and Schneider et al. (2004). These works have shown that even the\nfirst SNe evolving from zero-metal progenitor stars can efficiently produce dust at 150\u2013800\ndays after the explosion. The ratio of the total dust mass to the progenitor mass Mpr is\n0.02\u20130.05 for SNe II with Mpr = 12\u201335 M\u2299 and 0.15\u20130.3 for PISNe with Mpr = 140\u2013260\nM\u2299 . The composition of the newly formed dust grains are controlled by the elemental\ncomposition inside the He core, and their sizes range from 0.001 \u03bcm to 1 \u03bcm, depending on\nthe concentration of the gas species forming dust and the time evolution of temperature and\ndensity of gas.\nThe results of these calculations have been applied to study the high-redshift dust.\nMaiolino et al. (2004b) demonstrated a SN origin for high-redshift dust, showing that the\nextinction curve of the z = 6.2 quasar SDSS1048+46 can be nicely fitted by the SN II dust\nmodels from Todini & Ferrara (2001). Dust produced in the unmixed SNe II by Nozawa et al.\n(2003) can also successfully reproduce the extinction curve of the quasar SDSS1048+46 by\nweighting the progenitor mass with the Salpeter initial mass function (Hirashita et al. 2005).\nAdopting the dust models by Nozawa et al. (2003), Nozawa et al. (2006) investigated the\ndestruction of dust in the early ISM by the high-velocity shocks driven by SNe, and derived\nthe timescale of dust destruction in the early universe as a function of the explosion energy\nof SNe and the gas density in the ISM. It should be pointed out here that these studies\nimplicitly assumed that dust grains formed in SNe are injected into the ISM without their\ncomposition and size distribution being reprocessed.\nHowever, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the surrounding medium will create\na reverse shock which will process the grains that condensed in the He core before their\ninjection into the ISM. Once the newly formed dust grains encounter the reverse shock,\nthey acquire the high velocities relative to the gas and penetrate into the hot gas created\nby the passage of the reverse shock and forward shock. These dust grains are eroded by\nthe kinetic sputtering and are also decelerated by the drag force of the gas. Small grains\ndecelerate efficiently, and become trapped in the hot gas, where they are efficiently destroyed\nby thermal sputtering. On the other hand, large grains can maintain their high velocities,\npass through the shocked gas and the outwardly expanding shock front, and be injected into\nthe ISM without significant destruction. The net amount and composition of the dust that\nis eventually returned to the ISM by SNe differs substantially from the dust that was in the\nSN ejecta shortly after its formation.\nIn this paper, we study the evolution of dust formed in primordial SNe II and PISNe,\nconsidering its processing through the collisions with the reverse shocks and its transport\nwithin SNRs, based on the dust formation calculations by Nozawa et al. (2003). The\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nquestions that we pose here are what fraction of dust grains formed in Population III SNe\ncan survive the hostile circumstances within SNRs and how their size distributions can be\naltered by sputtering in the postshock flow. This subject has not been fully explored to\ndate. Recently, Bianchi & Schneider (2007) have studied the evolution of newly condensed\ngrains through the passage of the reverse shock by using a semi-analytical model and have\nshowed that the fraction of dust mass survived ranges between 2 % and 20 % depending on\nthe density in the ISM. However, they consider only the dust evolution in the nonradiative\nphase of SNR up to about 4\u20138\u00d7104 yr from the SN explosion, without taking into account the\nmotion of dust relative to gas caused by the drag force which strongly affects the destruction\nprocess and evolution of dust in SNRs. In the calculations, we carefully treat the dynamics\nand destruction of dust and the time evolution of the temperature and density of the gas\nwithin SNRs until \u223c105 \u2013106 yr extending over a period of the radiative phase, in order to\nreveal how much amount of dust is finally injected into the ISM or destroyed completely.\nAlthough we focus on Population III SNe in this paper, this study can also give great insight\ninto the evolution of dust in Galactic SNRs.\nIn \u00a7 2, we describe the initial conditions for the evolution of SNRs, the model of dust\ninside the He core, and the physics of dust and gas within SNRs. In \u00a7 3, we present and discuss\nthe results of calculations. In \u00a7 4, we shall discuss the effects of the hydrogen envelope on\nthe evolution of dust in SNRs. As an application of the result, we investigate the abundance\npatterns of the second-generation stars formed in the dense shell of Population III SNRs in\n\u00a7 5. The summary is presented in \u00a7 6.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nTHE MODEL OF CALCULATIONS\n\nThe Initial Conditions for the Evolution of SNRs\n\nThe evolution of SNR is described by three characteristic parameters; explosion energy,\nejecta mass, and the density profile of the ambient gas (Truelove & McKee 1999). In this\npaper, we focus on the evolution of ejecta expanding into a uniform ambient medium whose\nelemental composition is primordial. To investigate the dependence of the efficiency of dust\ndestruction on the ambient gas density, we consider three cases for the hydrogen number\ndensity in the ISM; nH,0 = 0.1, 1, and 10 cm\u22123 . The temperature of gas T0 in the ISM can\nbe also affect the evolution of SNRs, since the ambient pressure regulates the deceleration\nof blast wave. However, we have confirmed that the results of calculations are almost independent of the value of T0 , provided that T0 = 103 \u2013105 K. Thus, we assume here T0 = 104 K\nregardless of the gas density in the ISM, referring to the studies showing that the radiative\nfeedback from the massive pre-SN stars can cause the ambient ISM to heat up to T0 \u223c 104\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nK (Kitayama et al. 2004; Machida et al. 2005).\nThe initial conditions for the structures of density and velocity in the ejecta are taken\nfrom the hydrodynamic models of Population III SNe by Umeda & Nomoto (2002). We\nadopt six SN models; four SNe II and two PISNe. The explosion energy of SNe II with\nMpr = 13, 20, 25, and 30 M\u2299 is 1051 erg, and that of PISNe with Mpr = 170 and 200 M\u2299 is\n2 \u00d7 1052 erg and 2.8 \u00d7 1052 erg, respectively. It should be mentioned here that the massive\nmetal-free stars cannot lose significant mass during their lifetime due to pulsations and linedriven stellar winds which are considered to be important at high metallicities (Baraffe et al.\n2001). Although Smith & Owocki (2006) have suggested that the mass loss of very massive\nstars above roughly 40\u201350 M\u2299 may be possible by continuum-driven winds or hydrodynamic\nexplosions being insensitive to metallicity, the mechanism to trigger such a mass loss is an\nopen question. Thus, we consider that Population III PISNe as well as SNe II have retained\ntheir thick hydrogen envelopes at the time of explosion.\n\n2.2.\n\nDust Model inside the He core\n\nIn the ejecta of SNe, dust grains can nucleate and grow only in the metal-rich cooling gas,\nand their composition and size distribution largely depend on the elemental abundance inside\nthe He core (Kozasa et al. 1989). Accordingly, Nozawa et al. (2003) have calculated the\ndust formation in Population III SNe by considering two cases for the elemental composition\ninside the He core. They found that in the unmixed ejecta with the original onion-like\nstructure, a variety of grain species condense in each layer. The main grain species are C\ngrain in carbon-rich He layer; Al2 O3 , Mg2 SiO4 , and MgO grains in O-Mg-Si layer; Al2 O3 ,\nMgSiO3 , and SiO2 grains in O-Si-Mg layer; Si and FeS grains in Si-S-Fe layer; Fe grain in the\ninnermost Fe-Ni core. On the other hand, oxide (Al2 O3 and Fe3 O4 ) and silicate (MgSiO3 ,\nMg2 SiO4 , and SiO2 ) grains are formed in the uniformly mixed ejecta with C/O < 1, where\nthe efficiency of unity is assumed for the formation of CO and SiO molecules.\nDust grains inside the He core are never processed by kinetic or thermal sputtering\nbefore they hit the reverse shock, because they move with the same velocities as the gas,\nand the gas temperature within the He core is too low for dust grains to be destroyed by the\nthermal sputtering. Therefore, as the initial condition of dust residing within the He core,\nwe adopt the size distribution, mass fraction, and spatial distribution of each dust species\ncalculated by Nozawa et al. (2003). In what follows, we refer to the dust grains created\nin the unmixed and mixed ejecta as the unmixed grain model and the mixed grain model,\nrespectively.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.3.\n\nPhysics of Gas and Dust in SNRs\n\nThe collision of the expanding SN ejecta with the surrounding ISM simultaneously\ncreates a forward shock at the interface between the ejecta and the ISM, and a reverse shock\nthat penetrates into the ejecta. Once the reverse shock encounters dust grains inside the He\ncore, the dust grains are decoupled from the comoving gas to ballistically intrude into the hot\ngas heated by the reverse shock, and then they are eroded via the kinetic sputtering because\nof high velocities relative to gas. If dust grains are trapped into the postshock flow owing to\nthe gas drag, they are destroyed via the thermal sputtering caused by the thermal motion\nof gas. These dust particles are also heated by the collisions with the gas and radiate the\nthermal emission to cool the postshock gas. The rates of deceleration, erosion by sputtering,\nand heating of dust grains depend on not only their chemical composition and size but also\nthe temperature and density of the gas in the postshock flow.\nRecently, Nozawa et al. (2006, NKH06) have calculated the dust destruction in the\nhigh-velocity interstellar shocks driven by SNe in the early universe, by carefully treating\nthe dynamics, erosion, and heating of dust grains, taking account of their size distribution\nand the time evolution of the temperature and density of the gas in the postshock flow.\nThe present calculations of the dust evolution within SNRs follow the method described in\nNKH06 (see, NKH06 for details). We briefly mention the outline, focusing on the difference\nin the cooling function used in the calculations.1\nWe assume that the spherically symmetric ejecta collides with the ISM in 10 yr after\nthe explosion. With the initial conditions described in \u00a7 2.1, the time evolution of the gas\nin SNRs is numerically solved with the flux-splitting method (van Albada, et al. 1982;\nMair et al. 1988). In the calculations, we include three processes of the radiative cooling\nin the equation of the conservation of energy. The first is the thermal emission from dust\ncollisionally heated in the postshock flow, and the second is the inverse Compton cooling,\nwhose rate is calculated at the redshift of z = 20. The third is the cooling of gas by the\n1\n\nNote that in the calculation we neglect the effect of Coulomb drag on the motion of dust: The ratio of\nthe Coulomb drag force to the gas drag force is given by \u223c\u03c62 ln \u039b(Gplasma (s)/Gcoll (s)) (Draine & Salpeter\n1979), where \u03c6 is the dimensionless potential parameter, \u039b is the Coulomb cutoff factor, and s is defined by\ns2 = mwd2 /2kT with m the mass of gas and wd the velocity of dust relative to gas. Gplasma /Gcoll < 1 for\n0 < s < \u221e (Draine & Salpeter 1979), ln \u039b \u223c30\u201340 in SNRs (Dwek & Arendt 1992), and \u03c6 is evaluated to be\n\u223c105 /T for the gas temperatrure of T & 105.5 K (McKee et al. 1987). Thus, the Coulomb drag is negligible\ncompared with the gas drag for T & 106 K, otherwise it can play important role in the deceleration of dust.\nHowever, the erosion rate of dust grains by thermal sputtering quickly decreases at T . 106 K (NKH06). As\na result, the Coulomb drag does not significantly affect the motion and destruction of dust grains considered\nin this paper.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\natomic process. For the gas with the primordial composition in the hydrogen envelope and\nbehind the forward shock, we adopt the atomic cooling function for the zero metal case given\nby Sutherland & Dopita (1993) that is limited to the gas temperature of T \u2265 104 K. In order\nto calculate the evolution of the gas in the dense shell appeared at the later phase of SNRs,\nwe extrapolate the cooling rate of gas at T < 104 K as follows. Referring to Machida et\nal. (2005), the atomic cooling rate at T < 104 K is approximately proportional to T 4 ; the\ncooling rate decreases from \u039bgas \u2243 10\u221223 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 at T = 104 K to \u039bgas \u2243 10\u221227 erg cm\u22123\ns\u22121 at T = 103 K. Therefore, we simply evaluate the atomic cooling rate as \u039bgas = T44 \u039bgas\n4 ,\ngas\n4\nwhere T4 is the gas temperature in units of 10 K and \u039b4 is the atomic cooling rate at\nT = 104 K. For the metal-rich He core, we assume that the gas is only composed of oxygen\nwhich is the most abundant gas species inside the He core, and employ the cooling functions\nfrom Smith et al. (2001) for T \u2265 105 K and Raymond & Smith (1977) for T < 105 K. In\nthe calculations, we ignore the contribution of cooling by metal ions released from dust by\nsputtering for simplicity.\nThe dynamics and destruction of dust after colliding with the reverse shocks are calculated as follows. By treating dust as a test particle and ignoring the effect of charge on\ndust grains, the deceleration rate of dust due to the gas drag is calculated for each size of\nthe dust to evaluate the velocity relative to gas and the position. Then we calculate the\ndust destruction by sputtering and the heating by collisions with the gas, using the relative\nvelocity and the temperature and density of gas at the position. The sputtering yield of\neach dust species is calculated with the universal relation derived by NKH06. Dust grains\nare considered to be completely destroyed when their sizes become smaller than the radius\nof the nominal monomer of condensate. The cooling of gas through thermal emission of dust\nis calculated by balancing the heating of dust resulting from the collisions with electrons.\nThe calculations are performed by the truncation time at which the forward shock velocity\ndecelerates below 20 km s\u22121 .\n\n3.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section, we present the results of the calculations of dust evolution within primordial SNRs. In \u00a7 3.1, we demonstrate the time evolution of temperature and density of\ngas in the SNR, and in \u00a7 3.2, we show the transport and destruction of dust grains within\nSNRs. In \u00a7 3.3, we provide the resulting size distribution of survived dust and elucidate the\ndependence of the efficiency of dust destruction on the progenitor mass and the gas density\nin the ISM.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.1.\n\nTime Evolution of the Gas in the SNRs\n\nFigure 1 shows the time evolution of the density (Fig. 1a) and temperature (Fig. 1b)\nof gas by 2 \u00d7 104 yr in the SNR generated from the explosion of star with Mpr = 20 M\u2299\nand expanding into the ISM with nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 . The unmixed grain model is taken as the\nmodel of dust inside the He core, and the cooling of gas by dust is taken into account. In\nwhat follows, we refer to this model as the standard model.\nThe forward shock resulting from the interaction of the ambient gas with the ejecta\nof the SN is specified by the steep rise of the gas temperature and the increase of the gas\ndensity by \u223c4 times that in the ISM. The downward arrows in Figure 1a show the positions\nof the forward shock. We can also identify the formation of the reverse shock from high\ntemperature of gas heated by the compression of the ejecta, and indicate its position for\neach time by the downward arrow in Figure 1b.\nThe position Rrs (Fig. 2a) and velocity Vrs (Fig. 2b) of this reverse shock as a function\nof time are depicted by the thick solid curves in Figure 2. The reverse shock is decelerated\nby the shocked ambient medium while it initially expands outward, and then returns back\nat a distance of \u223c5 pc (1.5 \u00d7 1019 cm) with the velocity of a few 100 km s\u22121 . The trajectory\nof the reverse shock is affected by the detail structure of density in the ejecta. The collision\nwith the locally high-density gas inside the He core causes the reverse shock to move outward\nagain at 5200 yr. After 1.1 \u00d7 104 yr, the reverse shock goes inward through the He core with\nincreasing its velocity up to >1000 km s\u22121 . Hence, dust grains crossing the reverse shock\nacquire the different velocities relative to gas, depending on the time of collision with the\nreverse shock, and are efficiently eroded by the kinetic sputtering if the relative velocity is\n\u223c500\u20131300 km s\u22121 .\nIt can be seen from Figure 1 that the temperature of the gas in the region between the\nforward and reverse shocks is higher than 106 K. Thus, dust grains staying in this region are\nsubject to the thermal sputtering. However, the erosion rate of dust decreases as the SNR\nevolves because the density decreases with time. Around the truncation time (\u22438 \u00d7105 yr\nfor the standard model), the gas density within the SNR is more than 100 times lower than\nthat in the ISM, and the gas temperature becomes low (\u223cseveral times 105 K) enough for\ndust grains not to be sputtered efficiently, and thus the destruction of dust via the sputtering\nis extremely inefficient.\nThe influence of the cooling by dust on the SNR evolution is clarified by comparing the\nresults of calculations with and without the cooling by dust emission. The evolution of the\nreverse shock without the dust cooling for Mpr = 20 M\u2299 and nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 is shown by the\nthick dashed curves in Figure 2, where the cooling of gas by dust can cause the velocity of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe reverse shock to be reduced by \u223c10 %. The thin curves in Figure 2 show the evolution\nof the reverse shock penetrating into the ejecta of PISN with Mpr = 170 M\u2299 calculated\nfor nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 . Because the thermal emission from dust increases with increasing the\ndust mass, the effects of cooling by dust are significant for the remnants of PISNe, where\nthe mass of dust formed in the ejecta is a few tens M\u2299 . As we can see from the figure,\nthe velocity of the reverse shock including dust cooling (thin solid line) decreases to 0.6\ntimes that not including the cooling (thin dashed line) at & 7000 yr. In addition, the dust\ncooling decreases the gas temperature by \u223c20 %, compared with that calculated without\ndust cooling. However, it should be noted that the efficiency of dust destruction is little\naffected by the dust cooling, because most of dust grains are predominantly destroyed by\nthe thermal sputtering and the erosion rate is not sensitive to the gas temperature as long as\nT > 106 K (NKH06). Note that the cooling by oxygen line has no influence on the results,\nsince the temperature within the He core during the passage of the reverse shock is above\n107 K where the dominant cooling process of gas is free-free emission.\n\n3.2.\n\nTransport and Destruction of Dust in SNR\n\nThe time evolutions of the positions (Fig. 3a) and sizes (Fig. 3b) of dust grains within\nthe SNR for the standard model are given in Figure 3. In Figure 3a, the trajectories of\nthe forward and reverse shocks are also depicted by the thick solid curves, along with the\nposition of the surface of the He core. Among nine dust species in the unmixed grain model,\nare shown C, Mg2 SiO4 , and Fe grains with the initial sizes of 0.01 \u03bcm (dotted lines), 0.1\n\u03bcm (solid lines), and 1 \u03bcm (dashed lines), respectively. Each grain species initially moves\ncoupling with the gas with the velocity of \u223c1300, \u223c900, and \u223c400 km s\u22121 for C, Mg2 SiO4 ,\nand Fe grains, respectively, and collides with the reverse shock at 3650 yr for C grains formed\nin the outermost He core, 6300 yr for Mg2 SiO4 grains in the oxygen-rich layer, and 13000 yr\nfor Fe grains condensed in the innermost He core.\nThe collision time of the reverse shocks with dust grains depends on the initial velocity\nand position of dust, the thickness of the hydrogen envelope, and the density in the ISM.\nFigure 4 gives the collision time tcoll of the reverse shock with the He core for different\nprogenitor mass and gas density in the ISM. We can see that the collision time is shorter for\nPISNe than SNe II, in spite of the fact that PISNe have the thicker hydrogen envelopes. This\nreason is that the gas velocities (\u223c2000\u20133000 km s\u22121 ) at the outermost He core for PISNe\nwith the explosion energies higher than 1052 erg are a few times higher than those for SNe II.\nFor nH,0 = 0.1\u201310 cm\u22123 , the collision times are \u2243103 \u2013104 yr and decrease with increasing the\nambient gas density. Note that this result is not consistent with the observations of the Cas\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nA SNR, where thermal emission from dust heated by the reverse shock has already detected\nat \u2243330 yr after the explosion (Ennis et al. 2006 and references therein). This is because the\nprogenitor of the Cas A is believed to have lost the considerable hydrogen envelope during\ntheir evolution (Young et al. 2006), in contrast to the Population III SNe considered in this\npaper. We shall discuss the effect of the hydrogen envelope on the evolution of dust in the\nSNR in \u00a7 4.\nThe fates of dust grains within SNRs heavily depend on their initial sizes aini as well as\nthe chemical composition reflecting the difference in the sputtering yield and bulk density,\nas shown in Figure 3. For the standard model, the relatively small grains with aini = 0.01\n\u03bcm are efficiently decelerated due to the gas drag and are fully trapped into the hot plasma\nto be completely destroyed by the thermal sputtering. Note that the gas drag on grains\nwith small radii is more efficient than that on larger grains, because the deceleration rate of\ngrain is inversely proportional to its size (NKH06). Actually, the grains with the initial sizes\nless than 0.05 \u03bcm are trapped into the hot gas between the forward and reverse shocks and\ncontinue to be eroded by the thermal sputtering even at over 105 yr until they are completely\ndestroyed. Larger grains of aini = 0.1 \u03bcm undergo the kinetic and thermal sputtering while\nstreaming in the hot gas. Thanks to the high bulk density, Fe grains with aini = 0.1 \u03bcm are\ninjected into the ISM, reducing the size by 52 %. On the other hand, C and Mg2 SiO4 grains\nwith aini = 0.1 \u03bcm are trapped and eroded by the thermal sputtering in the denser region\nbehind the forward shock, and their surface layers whose thicknesses are 43 and 69 % of their\ninitial sizes are eroded, respectively, until 2 \u00d7 105 yr when the SNR enters into the radiative\nphase and the dense SN shell is formed behind the forward shock. These dust grains remain\nin the dense shell without further processing because the gas cools down quickly below 106\nK. Thus, the decrease of sizes of these grains is truncated at a given size, and the erosion\nof dust with aini = 0.05\u20130.2 \u03bcm results in the final size of 0.001\u20130.1 \u03bcm, depending on their\ninitial sizes. For 1 \u03bcm-sized C, Mg2 SiO4 , and Fe grains, the kinetic sputtering reduces their\nsizes by 0.7, 6, and 8 %, respectively. Note that large grains with aini & 0.2 \u03bcm can go across\neven the forward shock and be injected into the ISM, because the deceleration due to the\ngas drag is very inefficient.\nWe should mention here that the degree of the erosion of dust is a complex function\nof the initial position and initial size of the dust as well as the sputtering yield. Fe grains\nformed in the innermost He core and travelling through the oxygen-rich gas undergo the\nefficient erosion, since the sputtering yield by an oxygen ion is \u223c50 times larger than that\nby a proton. In contrast, the degree of the erosion of C grains in the outermost He core is\nrelatively small because they can quickly escape from the He core after the collision with\nthe reverse shock and also have the sputtering yield lower than those of other dust species.\nFurthermore, without being decelerated efficiently, the larger grains with the high velocities\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nrelative to gas are more efficiently eroded by sputtering in the relatively dense region near\nthe forward shock front. However, the grains with the sizes larger than a given size can evade\nthe erosion in the shocked hot gas within SNRs and are expelled into the ISM.\nAlthough the processing of dust in the ISM is not the main subject of this paper, here\nwe shall simply show the processing of dust injected into the ISM as a consequence of dust\nevolution in SNRs. Dust grains injected into the ISM can be consumed through the kinetic\nsputtering because of the difference in velocity between the ambient cool gas and the dust\ngrains, while the grains can be also decelerated by the direct collisions with the gas. In this\ncase, the ratio of the final radius afin to the initial size aini of dust is dependent only on the\nescape velocity w0 defined as the velocity with which dust is injected into the ISM passing\nthrough the forward shock, and is given by\n\" \u0012\n#\n\u0013 Z w0 X\nafin\n2msp\ndw\n= exp \u2212\n,\n(1)\nAi Yi0 (w)\naini\n3\u03bcg\nw\nwf\ni\nwhere msp is the average atomic mass of the elements sputtered from the grain, \u03bcg is the\nmean molecular weight of the gas, and Yi0 (w) is the sputtering yield at normal incidence by\ngas species i whose number abundance is Ai .\nFigure 5 shows the results calculated by Equation (1) for the primordial gas composition\nas a function of the escape velocity. In the calculations, the final relative velocity wfin is taken\nas 10 km s\u22121 , which is small enough for dust grains not to be eroded by the kinetic sputtering.\nAlso we assume that the escape velocity equals to the initial velocity inside the He core, since\nvery large grains are ejected to the ISM with high velocities, not being decelerated efficiently.\nHence, the calculated afin gives the lower limit of the final size realized in the ISM. The final\nsize acquired by each dust species is different, depending on the sputtering yield Yi0 and the\naverage atomic mass msp , and decreases with increasing the escape velocity. The ratio of the\nfinal size to the initial size is \u22430.8 for C grains with w0 \u223c 1300 km s\u22121 , \u22430.5 for Mg2 SiO4\ngrains with w0 \u223c 900 km s\u22121 , and \u22430.5 for Fe grains with w0 \u223c 400 km s\u22121 . Thus, the\nsizes of very large grains supplied from SNe are decreased to 0.5\u20130.8 times those at the time\nof the ejection, but are not completely destroyed in the ISM. For PISNe with the explosion\nenergies higher than 1052 erg, the sizes of Fe grains with the initial velocities of \u22431000 km\ns\u22121 decrease by 70 % in the ISM, although the sizes of C and Mg2 SiO4 grains whose initial\nvelocities are in the range of 2000\u20133000 km s\u22121 are not significantly different from those\ncalculated for the standard model. Note that dust grains in the ISM are also processed by\nthe high-velocity interstellar shocks driven by the ambient SNe (NKH06), which is the major\nmechanism of the dust destruction in the ISM.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nEfficiency of Dust Destruction\n\nThe results described in \u00a7 3.2 imply that the size distribution of survived dust is greatly\ndeficient in small-sized grains, compared with that at the time of dust formation. In Figure\n6, we present the initial size distribution at the time of dust formation (Fig. 6a) and the size\ndistribution of dust at the truncation time (Fig. 6b) for the standard model. The comparison\nof these figures clearly indicates that grains with the radii below a few tens \u00c5 are missing for\nalmost all dust species. In particular, Al2 O3 grains are completely destroyed because their\ninitial sizes are smaller than 0.02 \u03bcm. We can also see that the sizes of the relatively large\ngrains are shifted to small sizes due to the erosion by sputtering. It should be pointed out\nhere that the size distribution of survived dust is different from that by Bianchi & Schneider\n(2007): They have found that the final size distribution show a flattening towards smaller\nsizes without any abrupt truncation. The main reason of this difference is considered as\nfollows. Bianchi & Schneider (2007) assumed that newly formed grains remain confined and\ntrapped at their initial positions in the ejecta. Therefore, dust grains remaining at their\ninitial positions cease to be eroded by sputtering on the timescale of 4\u20138\u00d7104 yr due to the\ndecrease of the gas density caused by expansion. As shown in \u00a7 3.2, our results show that\neven small grains of aini \u2264 0.05 \u03bcm penetrate into the hot plasma between the forward and\nreverse shocks, and are trapped and completely destroyed in the hot gas with the relatively\nhigh density. On the other hand, the erosion of grains with the radii of 0.05\u20130.2 \u03bcm produces\nthe grains with the final sizes of 0.001\u20130.1 \u03bcm remaining in the dense shell.\nThe critical size below which dust is destroyed is sensitive to the gas density in the\nambient medium. Although the critical size weakly depends on the dust species and their\ninitial positions, we can roughly estimate the average critical size for different gas density in\nthe ISM. For nH,0 = 0.1 cm\u22123 , the upper limit of the initial size of dust completely destroyed\nis \u223c0.01 \u03bcm, and the lower limit of that ejected to the ISM is \u223c0.03 \u03bcm. For nH,0 = 10\ncm\u22123 , the grains with aini . 0.2 \u03bcm are destroyed, and the grains with aini & 0.5 \u03bcm are\ninjected in the ISM. Note that the above critical sizes are true for the grain species except\nfor C grains. The critical size of C grain is 0.006, 0.02, and 0.07 \u03bcm for nH,0 =0.1, 1, and 10\ncm\u22123 , respectively, and is a few times smaller than other dust species, because C grains are\nlocated at the outermost He core and also have the lower erosion rate by sputtering. Note\nthat the initial sizes of Fe grains injected into the ISM are smaller than those of others by a\nfactor of \u223c2 because of the high bulk density, and are &0.02, 0.1, and 0.25 \u03bcm for nH,0 =0.1,\n1, and 10 cm\u22123 , respectively.\nOn the other hand, the critical size for each grain species is almost independent of\nthe progenitor mass as long as the explosion energy of SN is the same, because the time\nevolution of temperature and density of gas within SNRs is similar. For PISNe with the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nexplosion energies higher than 1052 erg and more massive hydrogen envelopes, the critical\nsize increases approximately by a factor of three, compared with that for SNe II. However,\nthe initial size of dust ejected to the ISM is less than 2 times that for SNe II, because the\nhigh initial velocity inside the He core makes the dust grains easily escape from SNRs. These\nresults lead to the conclusion that the large-sized grains dominate the mass of dust injected\nfrom SNe into the ISM.\nTables 1 and 2 summarize the mass fraction of dust destroyed \u01ebdest , piled up in the\ndense shell \u01ebshell , and ejected to the ISM \u01ebeject for the unmixed and mixed grain models,\nrespectively. In Figures 7a and 7b, we also present the total mass of survived dust for both\ngrain models, respectively, along with their initial total mass. We can first see that the mass\nof dust destroyed increases with increasing the surrounding gas density. In particular, for\nnH,0 = 10 cm\u22123 , all or almost all (&85 %) of dust grains formed in the ejecta are destroyed,\nand the mass of survived dust is less than 0.1 M\u2299 for all models considered in this paper.\nThis reason is as follows; the erosion of dust takes place in the hot gas between the forward\nand reverse shocks, whose density increases with the ambient gas density. Therefore, the\nhigher ISM gas density leads to the efficient erosion and deceleration of dust through the\nmore frequent collisions with the hot gas. Next, we find that the mass fraction of dust\ndestroyed is generally higher for the mixed grain model than the unmixed grain model; for\nSNe II with nH,0 = 1 (0.1) cm\u22123 , \u01ebdest = 0.5\u20130.8 (0.2\u20130.4) for the unmixed grain model, while\n\u01ebdest = 0.9\u20130.99 (0.57\u20130.78) for the mixed grain model. This reflects the fact that the mixed\ngrain model lacks the grains larger than 0.05 (0.01) \u03bcm in comparison with the unmixed\ngrain model. Finally, it can be seen that dust grains formed in PISNe are more efficiently\ndestroyed than those in SNe II, since the newly formed dust grains are dominated by the\nsmall-sized grains and the critical size is much larger. Thus, for nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 , the mass\nof dust survived in PISNe is 0.1\u20131 M\u2299 for both grain models and is almost the same as\nthat (0.07\u20130.5 M\u2299 ) in the SNe II, though the mass of dust formed in PISNe is a few tens\ntimes higher than that in SNe II. Note that the dust destruction by reverse shocks is more\neffective than that by high-velocity interstellar shocks for the dust grains with the same size\ndistribution (NKH06).\nThe destruction efficiency defined as the ratio of the mass of dust destroyed to the\ninitial dust mass is given in Tables 3 and 4 for each dust species in the unmixed and mixed\ngrain model, respectively. As mentioned above, the efficiency of dust destruction is greatly\ninfluenced by what fraction of the initial dust mass is occupied by the sizes larger than the\ncritical size. Thus, the destruction efficiency for a given dust species is very sensitive to the\ninitial size distribution. Note that it is difficult to find the clear dependence of the destruction\nefficiency of each dust species on the progenitor mass because the size distribution of dust\nat the time of dust formation is different from model to model. However, for example,\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe efficiency of destruction of Al2 O3 grain with aini . 0.02 \u03bcm is \u223c1 for almost all cases\nconsidered in this paper. For the unmixed grain model, FeS and MgSiO3 grains are also\npredominantly destroyed. On the other hand, Fe, Si, and C grains for which most of the\nmass is locked into the grains larger than 0.05 \u03bcm have the relatively small destruction\nefficiencies. For the mixed grain model, SiO2 grains are the main dust species that are\nleft in SNRs and/or are injected into the ISM. Therefore, we conclude that the chemical\ncomposition, size distribution, and amount of dust grains supplied from SNe to the ISM are\nquite different from those at the time of dust formation.\nHere we shall discuss the dependence of the metallicity on the present results of calculations. First, it should be pointed out that the species of dust formed in the ejecta of\nSNe II and their size distributions are not sensitive to the metallicity of progenitor stars\n(Todini & Ferrara 2001; Nozawa 2003). Also the cooling function of gas for Z \u2264 10\u22123 Z\u2299 is\nindependent of the metallicity (Sutherland & Dopita 1993). Thus, the results of calculations\npresented in this paper can be directly applied to the evolution of dust in the ejecta of SNe\nII expanding into the ambient medium whose metallicity is less than 10\u22123 Z\u2299 . The increase\nof the metallicity in the ambient medium to the solar value greatly enhances the cooling of\ngas behind the forward shock and causes the time of the transition from nonradiative phase\nto radiative phase to be reduced to less than half of that for the zero-metallicity case. Nevertheless, the destruction efficiency of each grain species for Z = Z\u2299 decreases at most by 15\n% of that for Z = 0. Therefore, the results of present study could be useful for evaluating\nthe dust evolution in SNRs generated from SNe II, regardless of the initial metallicity of\nprogenitor stars and ambient medium. However, as is demonstrated in the next section, the\nthickness of hydrogen envelope strongly affects the motion and destruction of dust within\nSNRs.\n\n4.\n\nTHE EFFECT OF THE HYDROGEN ENVELOPE ON THE\nEVOLUTION OF DUST IN SNR\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a7 3.2, for the SNe with the thick hydrogen envelopes, it takes at least\nmore than 1000 yr for the reverse shocks to collide with the dust condensed inside the He\ncore. On the other hand, the infrared observations of the Cas A SNR (Dwek et al. 1987;\nLagage et al. 1996; Arendt et al. 1999; Douvion et al. 2001; Hines et al. 2004; Ennis et al.\n2006) have revealed the thermal emission from warm dust formed in the ejecta at \u2243330 yr\nafter the explosion. This difference of the time at which dust grains inside the He core are\nswept up by the reverse shocks is attribute to the difference in the thickness of the hydrogen\nenvelope of SNe. Therefore, in this section, we investigate the effect of the hydrogen envelope\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\non the evolution of dust in the SNR.\nIn order to illustrate the evolution of dust in the SNR generated from the SN whose\nhydrogen envelope is very thin, we adopt the model of ejecta with Mpr = 20 M\u2299 from Umeda\n& Nomoto (2002) and modify it by artificially reducing the mass of the hydrogen envelope\nfrom 13 M\u2299 to 0.7 M\u2299 at the time of explosion. Keeping the structure of the density, we\nsimply scale up the gas velocity so that the explosion energy can equal to 1051 erg. We also\nassume the dust inside the He core is the same as that formed in primordial SN II with\nMpr = 20 M\u2299 .\nFigure 8 illustrates the trajectories (Fig. 8a) and time evolutions of sizes (Fig. 8b) of C,\nMg2 SiO4 , and Fe grains with aini = 0.01 and 0.1 \u03bcm in the SNR calculated for nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 .\nAs can be expected, because the hydrogen envelope is very thin and the initial velocities of\ndust grains are very high (2000\u20135000 km s\u22121 depending on their initial positions), the dust\ngrains inside the He core collide with the reverse shock at much earlier time; 120 yr for C\ngrains, 570 yr for Mg2 SiO4 grains, and 1300 yr for Fe grains. Contrary to SNe II with the\nthick hydrogen envelopes, even the grains with aini = 0.1 \u03bcm can be ejected to the ISM\nwithout decreasing their sizes significantly; C and Mg2 SiO4 grains with aini = 0.1 \u03bcm reduce\ntheir sizes only by less than 6 %, while the sizes of Fe grains with aini = 0.1 \u03bcm decrease by\n18 % because the time staying in the hot gas is long, compared with C and Mg2 SiO4 grains.\nThe grains with aini = 0.01 \u03bcm are trapped into the hot gas and are completely destroyed.\nIn this case, the critical size below which dust is completely destroyed is \u223c0.04 \u03bcm, and the\nlower limit of the initial size of dust supplied to the ISM is \u223c0.04 \u03bcm which is five times\nsmaller than that for a SN II. Therefore, the thin hydrogen envelope as well as the high\ninitial velocity of dust causes almost all survived dust grains to be injected into the ISM\nwithout being trapped into the gas within the SNR. The mass fraction of dust destroyed is\n0.38, which is lower than 0.75 for the standard model, and thus more dust grains are supplied\nto the ISM. The result of calculation shows that the fates of dust grains formed in the ejecta\nstrongly depend on the thickness of the hydrogen envelope.\nHowever, we adopt the model of dust formed in a SN II and also consider the uniform\nambient medium. The significant mass loss of massive stars during their evolution results\nin the circumstellar medium that is not uniform and homogeneous. In addition, the time\nevolution of the temperature and density of gas in the ejecta of SNe without the hydrogen\nenvelopes such as Type Ib/c SNe is expected to be different from that in SNe II, which\ninfluences the dust formation in the ejecta. Therefore, we must clarify the size distribution\nand amount of dust grains formed in the ejecta to investigate the dependence of the evolution\nof dust on the type of SNe. This subject will be reported in the forthcoming paper.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n5.\n\nELEMENTAL ABUNDANCES OF THE SECOND-GENERATION\nSTARS\n\nSome extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars with [Fe/H] . \u22122.5 discovered in the Galactic\nhalo have peculiar abundance patterns showing the modest or large (1\u2013100 times) enhancements of C, N, O, Mg, and Si relative to solar (Venkatesan et al. 2006 and references therein).\nIn particular, two hyper metal-poor (HMP) stars with [Fe/H] . \u22125, HE 0107-5240 ([Fe/H]\n= \u22125.2, Christlieb et al. 2002) and HE 1327-2326 ([Fe/H] = \u22125.4, Frebel et al. 2005)\nshow extreme (&102 times) overabundances of C, N, and O relative to iron. Because the\nelemental composition of HMP stars expected to be the very early generation may strongly\nreflect the nucleosynthesis in Population III stars, several scenarios have been proposed to\nexplain the origin of elemental abundances in low-mass HMP stars; the mixing fall-back\nin a core-collapse SN (Umeda & Nomoto 2005; Iwamoto et al. 2005), the nucleosynthesis\nand mass transfer in a first-generation binary star (Suda et al. 2004; Komiya et al. 2006),\nthe pollution by the gas with heavy elements in the ISM (Shigeyama et al. 2003), and the\ncombinations of these scenarios described above (Christlieb et al. 2004).\nRecently, Venkatesan et al. (2006) have proposed that EMP stars are the secondgeneration stars formed in the dense shell of primordial SNRs and their peculiar abundances\ncan be reproduced by the segregated transport of newly formed dust decoupled from the\nmetal-rich gas in SNe. Adopting the dust models by Todini & Ferrara (2001) and Schneider\net al. (2004), they calculated the sputtering and the transport of dust driven by the UV\nradiation field from the stellar cluster within a SNR. They have conclude that the progenitor\nmass range of 10\u2013150 M\u2299 qualitatively explains the enhancement of the elements composing\ndust grains (C, O, Mg, and Si) in EMP stars, though they did not compare their results\nwith the abundance data on these metal-poor stars.\nThe results of the transportation and destruction of dust given in \u00a7 3.2 show that all\ndust grains remaining in primordial SNRs without being completely destroyed by sputtering\ncan be accumulated in the dense SN shell at \u223c105 \u2013106 yr after the explosion. Thus, it is\nconsidered that the formation of the second-generation stars with solar mass scales could\nbe possible in the shell contaminated with dust grains, as is investigated by Schneider et al.\n(2006). In this case, we can expect that the elemental compositions of dust grains piled up\ninto the dense shell reflect the metal abundance patterns of the second-generation stars.\nThe iron-bearing dust species including the most important element Fe are Fe and FeS\ngrains for the unmixed grain model, and Fe3 O4 grain for the mixed grain model. Note that\nC grains cannot be formed in the mixed ejecta because the ejecta is oxygen-rich, and Fe3 O4\ngrains with aini . 0.05 \u03bcm are dominantly destroyed in the postshock flow and are rarely\naccumulated in the SN shell for nH,0 = 1 and 10 cm\u22123 . Hence, we show only the results\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ncalculated for the unmixed grain model. In addition, Fe and FeS grains are not significantly\npiled up in the shell of PISN remnants, since most of them are completely destroyed or are\ninjected into the ISM. Thus, we focus on the results for Type II SNRs.\nThe abundances of C, O, Mg, and Si relative to Fe in the dense shell are summarized\nin Tables 5, where we neglect the contribution of metal atoms sputtered from the grains\ncrossing the dense shell because the largest-sized grains are only eroded by less than 1% of\nH\ntheir radii. The hydrogen mass in the dense SN shell Mshell\nat the truncation time is given\nin Table 1. It can be seen from Table 5 that all models considered here predict the value of\n[Fe/H] less than \u22124, and most of them exhibit the value of [Fe/H] ranging from \u22126 to \u22125.\nThus, two HMP stars are considered to be formed in the dense shell of primordial SNRs.\nAmong the 9 models with \u22126 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22125, the abundances of Mg and Si are in the\nrange of \u22121.2 \u2264 [Mg/Fe] \u2264 1.2 and \u22120.6 \u2264 [Si/Fe] \u2264 2.7, respectively, and 8 models can\nproduce the overabundances of Mg and/or Si. This result suggests that the dust formed in\nthe unmixed ejecta of SNe II can be responsible for the peculiar abundance patterns of Mg\nand Si in HMP stars. Although a few models (20 M\u2299 and 30 M\u2299 for nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 and\n25 M\u2299 for nH,0 = 0.1 cm\u22123 ) result in the overabundances of C and O as well as Mg and Si,\n[C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are limited to <1.6 and <0.6, respectively.\nFor comparison, we apply the present calculations to the models of dust formation in\nthe SN II with Mpr = 22 M\u2299 by Todini & Ferrara (2001) and in PISN with Mpr = 195\nM\u2299 by Schneider et al. (2004). Because the sizes of the dust grains calculated by them are\nconsiderably small (.0.04 \u03bcm) except for C grain, the grain species that can survive the\ndestruction through the collisions with the reverse shocks is only C grain for the ambient\ngas density of nH,0 = 0.1\u201310 cm\u22123 . Thus, their dust models cannot explain the abundance\npatterns of the metals except for C observed in HMP and EMP stars.\n\n6.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe investigate the evolution of dust formed at Population III SN explosions through the\ncollision with the reverse shocks within SNRs. We adopt the models of dust grains obtained\nfrom the calculation of dust formation in Population III SNe by Nozawa et al. (2003) and\ntake into account their spatial distribution and size distribution as the initial condition.\nThe calculations carefully treat the dynamics, erosion, and heating of dust grains, and the\nevolution of temperature and density of gas in spherically symmetric shocks is solved as a\nfunction of time. We also discuss the effect of the hydrogen envelope on the evolution of dust\nin the SNR. Furthermore, from the analysis of the transport and destruction of dust within\nSNRs, we investigate the abundances of elements related to dust in the second-generation\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nstars formed in the dense shell of primordial SNRs.\nThe our main results are summarized as follows.\n1. The time that the reverse shock encounters the dust that condensed inside the He\ncore depends on the thickness of the H-envelope that was retained by the progenitors of the\nPopulation III SNe. If the progenitor stars did not undergo significant mass loss, the reverse\nshock will encounter the dust \u2243103 \u2013104 yr after the explosion, depending on the density of\ngas in the ISM.\n2. Once dust grains inside the He core collide with the reverse shocks, they will follow\ndifferent trajectories depending on their initial sizes, resulting in the differential transport\nand destruction of dust in SNRs. For Type II SNRs expanding into the ISM with the density\nof nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 , small grains with aini . 0.05 \u03bcm are rapidly trapped into the postshock\nflow and are completely destroyed by sputtering. Grains with aini = 0.05\u20130.2 \u03bcm are trapped\nand remain in the dense shell behind the forward shock. Very large grains with aini & 0.2\n\u03bcm are ejected to the ISM through the forward shock without significantly decreasing their\nsizes.\n3. The critical size below which dust is completely destroyed in SNRs is sensitive to\nthe gas density in the ambient medium, and spans the range of 0.01\u20130.2 \u03bcm for nH,0 =\n0.1\u201310 cm\u22123 . The resulting size distribution of survived dust is greatly deficient in smallsized grains, compared with that at the time of dust formation, although the erosion of large\ngrains produces the smaller-sized grains. Thus, the mass of dust injected from SNe into the\nISM is dominated by the large grains.\n4. The total mass fraction of dust destroyed in SNRs ranges from 0.2 to 1 and increases\nwith increasing the ambient gas density and explosion energy of SNe. The destruction\nefficiency of each dust species is very sensitive to the initial size distribution, and the dust\nspecies whose mass is predominantly occupied by the sizes larger than the critical size can\nsurvive. Therefore, the chemical composition, size distribution, and amount of dust grains\nsupplied from SNe to the ISM are quite different from those at the time of dust formation.\n5. The results for the evolution of dust in SNRs presented in this paper can be directly\napplied for the initial metallicity of progenitor stars and ambient medium less than Z \u2264 10\u22123\nZ\u2299 , and could be useful for evalulating the evolution of dust in the Galactic SNRs generated\nfrom SNe II.\n6. The fates of dust grains formed in the ejecta strongly depend on the thickness of\nthe hydrogen envelope. For the SNR generated from the SN with the very thin hydrogen\nenvelope, the collision time of the reverse shock with dust grains inside the He core is much\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nearlier. As long as the model of dust for SNe II is employed for the calculation, the mass of\ndust supplied to the ISM is larger than SNe II with the thick hydrogen envelopes.\n7. If the elemental compositions of dust grains piled up in the SN shell reflect the metal\nabundance patterns of the second-generation stars formed in the dense shell of primordial\nSNRs, the dust formed in the unmixed ejecta of SNe II can be responsible for the peculiar abundance patterns of Mg and Si in HMP stars. However, another scenario could be\nnecessary to produce the large overabundances of C and O observed in HMP stars.\nThe authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for critical comments that are useful\nfor improving the manuscript.
