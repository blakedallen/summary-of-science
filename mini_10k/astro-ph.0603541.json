This conclusion is insensitive to assumptions about\nthe efficiency of ionizing photon production in the large halos, as long as reionization ends by z = 6, as required\nby the spectra of bright quasars at z <\n\u223c 6. Our conclusion is strengthened if the clumping of the ionized gas evolves\nwith redshift, as suggested by semi\u2013analytical predictions and three-dimensional numerical simulations.\nLyman-Werner (LW) bands (e.g. Haiman, Rees & Loeb 1997;\nCiardi et al 2000; Ricotti, Gnedin & Shull 2001). In patches\nof the IGM corresponding to fossil HII regions that have recombined, the gas retains excess entropy, which can reduce gas\ndensities in the cores of collapsing halos, and lower the LW\nradiation background that photodissociates H2 (Oh & Haiman\n2002; Gnedin 2000). On the other hand, positive feedback effects, such as the presence of extra free electrons (beyond the\nresidual electrons from the recombination epoch) from protogalactic shocks (Shapiro & Kang 1987; Ferrara 1998), from\na previous ionization epoch (Oh & Haiman 2003; Susa et al.\n1998), or from X\u2013rays (Haiman, Rees & Loeb 1996, Oh 2001;\nRicotti et al. 2002a,b), can enhance the H2 abundance. Whether\nor not gas cooling in minihalos was efficiently quenched globally has remained unclear, with numerical simulations generally\nfavoring less quenching (Machacek et al. 2001, 2003; Ricotti\net al. 2002a,b; Kuhlen & Madau 2005) than predicted in semi\u2013\nanalytical models.\nThe purpose of this Letter is to place constraints on the efficiency of minihalos to produce and inject ionizing photons\ninto the IGM, using the value of \u03c4 inferred from the WMAP\npolarization data. Although the absolute values of the relevant\nefficiency parameters are uncertain, there is a robust lower limit\non their combination from the requirement that reionization is\ncompleted prior to z = 6. As a result, a measurement of \u03c4 permits robust conclusions about the evolution of the efficiency\nwith redshift or halo mass\u2013scale (HH03; Cen 2003; Onken &\nMiralda-Escud\u00e9 2004). The main conclusion of this Letter is\nthat the efficiency with which minihalos injected ionizing radiation into the IGM was about an order of magnitude lower\nthan expected and lower than in larger halos, requiring negative\nfeedback at high redshift.\nThroughout this letter, we adopt the background cosmological parameters as measured recently by the WMAP experiment\n(Spergel et al. 2005, Table 5), \u03a9m = 0.24, \u03a9\u039b = 0.76, \u03a9b =\n0.0407, h = 0.72 and an initial matter power spectrum P(k) \u221d kn\nwith n = 0.96 and normalization \u03c38 = 0.76. The values of these\nparameters determine the required overall efficiencies, but do\nnot otherwise have a significant effect on our conclusions.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nHow and when the intergalactic medium (IGM) was reionized is one of the long outstanding questions in astrophysical\ncosmology, holding clues about the onset of structure formation\nin cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies, and the nature of the\nfirst generation of light sources (see Barkana & Loeb 2001 for\na review). The reionization history can be probed via the scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons\nby the free electrons liberated during reionization (see, e.g.,\nHaiman & Knox 1999 for a review). The total electron scattering optical depth \u03c4 = 0.088+0.028\n\u22120.034 (Spergel et al. 2005, Table\n5) that has been inferred from the WMAP three\u2013year polarization data (Page et al. 2005) implies that reionization occurred\n1\nrelatively recently, at zr <\n\u223c 11.\nAn outstanding question, and the focus of this Letter, is whether\nthe gas in the majority of the first\u2013generation low\u2013mass halos\nwas able to cool and form ionizing sources (stars and/or black\nholes [BHs]), and contribute to reionizing the IGM. The neu4\ntral gas in halos with virial temperatures Tvir <\n\u223c 10 K (hereafter\n\"minihalos\") cannot cool via atomic hydrogen alone, and the\npresence of H2 (or other) molecules is a necessary condition\nfor the gas to reach high densities and to ultimately form stars\nor BHs in these halos (Saslaw & Zipoy 1967). As a result, these\n> 104 K, which\nhalos are distinct from larger halos with Tvir \u223c\nare expected to have different star\u2013formation properties (Oh &\nHaiman 2002; Johnson & Bromm 2006). Since the smallest halos are the first to collapse, whether or not typical minihalos are\nable to host ionizing sources is the most significant factor in determining when reionization began, and driving the value of \u03c4\n(Haiman & Holder 2003 [HH03]; see Abel & Haiman 2000 for\na review focusing on the role of H2 molecules for reionization).\nIn isolation, minihalos with virial temperatures as low as a\nfew 100 K could form enough H2 , via gas\u2013phase chemistry, for\nefficient cooling and gas contraction (Haiman, Thoul & Loeb\n1996; Tegmark et al. 1997). However, H2 molecules are fragile,\nand can be dissociated by soft UV radiation absorbed in their\n1\n\nAssuming an abrupt transition from a fully neutral to a fully ionized IGM,\nand assuming helium is once ionized at the same redshift as hydrogen, we find\nzr < 10.9+2.2\n\u22123.1 for the cosmological parameters listed in Table 5 in Spergel et al.\n(2005).\n\n1\n\n\f2\n2. MODELS OF REIONIZATION\n\nIn this section, we briefly describe our semi\u2013analytical model\nof the reionization process. The treatment follows the prescriptions in HH03, and the reader is referred to this paper for a\ndetailed description; we only recapitulate the main features and\na few important modifications here. The models track the total\nvolume\u2013filling factor FHII (z) of ionized regions, assuming that\nionizing sources are located inside virialized dark matter halos. The sources create ionized HII regions, which expand into\nthe IGM at a rate dictated by the source luminosity, and by the\nbackground gas density and clumping factor.2\nThe efficiency with which the ionizing source(s) associated\nwith each halo inject ionizing photons into the IGM is parameterized by the product \u01eb \u2261 N\u03b3 f\u2217 fesc , where f\u2217 \u2261 M\u2217 /(\u03a9b Mhalo /\u03a9m )\nis the fraction of baryons in the halo that turns into stars; N\u03b3\nis the mean number of ionizing photons produced by an atom\ncycled through stars, averaged over the initial mass function\n(IMF) of the stars; and fesc is the fraction of these ionizing\nphotons that escapes into the IGM. We define separate efficiencies, \u01ebmini , \u01eblarge for the minihalos and large halos, respectively.\nThe distinction between the halos is made at Tvir = 104 K, with\nthe relation Tvir \u2248 1800(M/106M\u2299 )2/3 (1 + z)/21 K. We adopt\nthe virial temperature for the smallest minihalos that can cool\nvia H2 and form stars to be Tmin = 400K (Haiman et al. 1996;\nTegmark et al. 2001; Machacek et al. 2001 \u2013 note that the\nchoice in HH03 was lower, Tmin = 100 K).\nGas infall is expected to be suppressed for sufficiently small\nhalos in actively ionized and photo\u2013heated patches of the IGM.\nWe define a temperature Tuv and only permit halos with virial\ntemperatures below this value to form ionizing sources in the\nneutral fraction 1 \u2212 FHII (z) of the volume of the IGM. The value\nof Tuv is uncertain \u2013 at low redshifts it is commonly taken as \u2248\n2.5\u00d7105 K, corresponding to a velocity dispersion \u03c3 = 50 km s\u22121\n(e.g., Thoul & Weinberg 1996). However, Dijkstra et al. (2004)\nshowed that this suppression is less efficient at high redshift,\nz<\nand based on their result for halos collapsing at redshifts 6 <\n\u223c 10,\n\u223c \u22121\n4\nwe adopt the fiducial value of Tuv = 9 \u00d7 10 K (or \u03c3 \u223c 30km s ).\nIn order to match inferences from the z <\n\u223c 6.5 quasar spectra\n(Becker et al. 2001; Fan et al. 2006), we require that percolation takes place at redshift z = 6.5. At this redshift, ionization is\ndominated by larger halos, and so this requirement effectively\nfixes the value of \u01eblarge = 120.3 This value of the overall efficiency is reasonable: for a normal stellar population with a\nSalpeter mass function, N\u03b3 = 4000, and we may break down\nthe efficiency into f\u2217 = 0.15 and fesc = 0.2. The star\u2013formation\nrate at z \u223c 6 predicted with these assumptions is consistent with\nthe global value inferred from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (see\nMesinger et al. 2005 for a comparison).\nFinally, the evolution of the ionized fraction depends on the\nclumping factor of the ionized gas, CHII \u2261 hn2HII i/hnHII i2 . The\nvalue of the clumping factor at z \u223c 6 does not impact our results because it is absorbed into \u01eblarge , which, in turn, is set by\nthe requirement that the ionization percolates at z = 6.5. This\nnormalization requires \u01eblarge \u2248 120 \u00d7 CHII (z = 6)/10. However,\nwe find that the evolution of CHII with redshift has a significant\n2\n\nWe do not explicitly treat the reionization of helium, but assume the HeII/HeI\nfraction follows the HII/HI fraction when we compute \u03c4 . For neutral/doubly\nionized helium, \u03c4 would be smaller/larger by \u223c 8%.\n3 HH03 found a value that was 50% smaller \u2013 we here find that the efficiency\nincreases by a factor of 3 because of the lower small scale power implied by the\n3\u2013yr WMAP data (lower \u03c38 and ns ), but was decreased by a factor of 2 due to\nour lower value of Tuv .\n\nF IG . 1.- The assumed evolution of the clumping factor of ionized gas with\nredshift. The thick solid (red) curve is adopted as our fiducial case, and has\na decrease by a factor of \u223c 4 between z = 6 and z = 15. The shaded range\nindicates models in which this decrease varies from a factor of 2 \u2212 10; the\nlimiting case of a constant clumping factor of CHII = 10 is shown as the dotted\nline.\n\neffect on our results. We do not attempt to model this evolution ab\u2013initio; instead we adopt a relation that is a conservative\ncompromise between three different ab\u2013initio approaches, and\nwe vary our parameters to reflect the range of predictions of the\nthree models (see discussion in \u00a7 3 below). The relation we\nadopt is a simple power-law,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212\u03b2\n1+z\nCHII (z) \u2212 1 = 9\n,\n(1)\n7\nwhich has a fixed CHII (z = 6) = 10, and declines towards high\nredshift at a rate given by the slope \u03b2. What matters most for\nour results below is the decrease between z = 6 (the redshift\nwhich sets \u01eblarge ) and 15 <\n\u223c 20 (the redshift which determines\n\u223cz<\nthe contribution to \u03c4 from the minihalos). In our fiducial model,\n\u03b2 = 2, corresponding to the ratio CHII (z = 6)/CHII (z = 15) = 3.7.\nThis choice, together with the range 1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 6 (corresponding\nto a range of ratios 2 < CHII (z = 6)/CHII (z = 15) < 10), is shown\nin Figure 1. For reference, the dotted line shows the limiting\ncase of a constant clumping factor (\u03b2 = 0).\nIn summary, our models have only two free parameters: \u01ebmini ,\nand \u03b2. In addition, we will consider uncertainties in Tmin , the\nminimum mass for efficient H2 cooling, and Tuv , the maximum\nvirial temperature of halos that can collect photo\u2013heated gas.\nWe next discuss our choices for the fiducial values of these parameters.\n3. FIDUCIAL PARAMETERS\n\nWhat is the expected value of \u01ebmini ? Abel, Bryan, & Norman\n(2002), and Bromm, Coppi & Larson (2002) suggest that minihalos form metal\u2013free stars from only a small fraction ( f\u2217 \u2248\n0.0025) of the available gas. On the other hand, the stars are, on\naverage, \u2248 20 times more efficient ionizing photon producers\n(per unit stellar mass) because they are massive (M >\n\u223c 100 M\u2299 )\n\n\f3\n\nF IG . 2.- The evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen. The thick solid\n(red) curves, the shaded ranges, and the limiting cases shown by the dotted\ncurves, correspond to the different logarithmic slopes for the evolution of the\nclumping factor with redshift CHII (z) shown in Figure 1. The lower set of four\ncurves assume star\u2013formation in minihalos (with 400K < Tvir < 104 K) has\nbeen completely suppressed (\u01ebmini = 0), and the upper set of curves assumes\nminihalos inject ionizing photons into the IGM with the fiducial efficiency\n(\u01ebmini = 200).\n\nand have harder spectra (Tumlinson & Shull 2000; Bromm, Kudritzki & Loeb 2001; Schaerer 2002). As a result, N\u03b3 \u2248 80000;\nand all of their ionizing radiation escapes into the IGM, at least\nfrom the smaller minihalos that contribute most of the high\u2013\nredshift tail for reionization ( fesc = 1; Whalen, Abel & Norman 2004). This results in the overall fiducial efficiency of\n\u01ebmini = \u01ebfid = 200. We note that this is quite close to the value\n\u01eblarge = 120 that we inferred for the large halos by requiring percolation to occur at z \u2248 6.5.\nSeveral authors have attempted to compute the clumping factor CHII (z) from first principles. In the simulations of Gnedin &\nOstriker (1997), it increases dramatically (by a factor of \u223c 50)\nbetween z = 6 and z = 15, but since they do not resolve smallscale fluctuations early on, this ratio may be an overestimate.\nIliev, Scannapieco & Shapiro (2005) have a different approach\nof separately estimating the contribution from the low\u2013density\nIGM from a simulation, and adding to this semi-analytic estimates of the clumping due to minihalos (Haiman, Abel &\nMadau 2001). They find an evolution that is less steep, with\nCHII (z = 10)/CHII (z = 15) \u2248 2, but they do not cover the interesting z < 10 range, where we normalize our models, and where\nCHII likely increases rapidly. Finally, Miralda-Escud\u00e9, Haehnelt\n& Rees (2000) offer a different prescription: they assume that\nthe IGM is ionized \"outside\u2013in\", with all the gas below a critical overdensity \u2206crit ionized at a given redshift (and neutral\nabove this threshold), to compute CHII directly. This prescription predicts relatively slow evolution, with \u2206crit \u2248 10 \u2212 20, until the late stages of reionization (as in Wyithe & Loeb 2003\nand Wyithe & Cen 2006). However, towards the end of the\nreionization epoch, \u2206crit increases rapidly. This is an important\ndistinction for our present purposes, because the ionizing emis-\n\nF IG . 3.- The optical depth to electron scattering \u03c4 , as a function of the\nefficiency of minihalos to inject ionizing photons into the IGM.

The\nthick solid (red) curve, the shaded range, and the limiting case shown by the\ndotted curve, follow the notation for models with different clumping factor\nevolutions shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Miralda-Escud\u00e9, Haehnelt & Rees (2000) show that by\nthe time the mean free path of ionizing photons grows to the\nHubble length (which appears to be the case at z \u223c 6; Lidz et\nal. 2005), \u2206crit >\n\u223c 500, which will correspond to a steep rise in\nthe clumping factor.\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen in several\nmodels is shown in Figure 2. The thick solid (red) curves,\nthe shaded ranges, and the limiting cases shown by the dotted\ncurves, correspond to the different clumping factor evolutions\nCHII (z) shown in Figure 1 with the same notation. The lower set\nof curves assumes star\u2013formation in minihalos has been completely suppressed (\u01ebmini = 0), and the upper set of curves assumes minihalos inject ionizing photons into the IGM with the\nfiducial efficiency (\u01ebmini = 200). All curves are normalized to\nproduce full reionization at z \u223c 6.5. Earlier reionization is consistent with SDSS quasar spectra; this would yield a larger \u03c4 ,\nand would strengthen our conclusions.\nThe models shown in Figure 2 that include minihalos have\noptical depths of \u03c4 = 0.14, 0.17, 0.19, and 0.23, and are all ruled\nout by the three\u2013year WMAP data at more than 95% CL. The\nmodels that exclude minihalos have \u03c4 = 0.077, 0.084, 0.091,\nand 0.12, and all except the case with the steepest CHII (z) evolution are within 1\u03c3 of the WMAP value.\nIn Figure 3, we show \u03c4 as a function of the efficiency \u01ebmini .\nThe figure follows the notation of Figures 1 and 2 to describe\nthe four different cases for the evolution of the clumping factor.\nThe main conclusion that can be drawn from this figure is that\nthe photon production efficiency in minihalos was smaller than\nthe expected fiducial value by a factor of >\n\u223c 2 \u2212 10. This also\n\n\f4\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nF IG . 4.- The predicted optical depth as a function of the ionizing efficiency\nof the minihalos (\u01ebmini /\u01ebfid ) and the logarithmic slope of the decline of the\nclumping factor with redshift (\u03b2 \u2261 d log(CHII \u2212 1)/d log(1 + z)). The lowest\ncontour (white region) corresponds to optical depths within one sigma of the\n3\u2013yr WMAP result, and each contour is a one-sigma increase in the optical\ndepth. The fiducial model is marked with an asterisk and deviates from the\nWMAP value by nearly 4\u03c3.\n\nmeans that minihalos contribute to reionization with a lower\nefficiency than the larger halos.\nMore generally, Figure 4 shows the predicted optical depth\nas a function of both \u01ebmini and \u03b2. The lowest contour (white\nregion) corresponds to optical depths within 1\u03c3 of the 3\u2013yr\nWMAP value, and each successive contour shows a 1\u03c3 increase.\nThe figure shows that our fiducial model deviates from the WMAP\nvalue by nearly 4\u03c3; consistency at the 1 \u2212 2\u03c3 level requires either reducing \u01ebmini by a factor of 2\u201310, or adopting an essentially non\u2013evolving clumping factor (\u03b2 \u2248 0) and a smaller reduction in \u01ebmini .\nIn order to examine the robustness of our conclusions to uncertainties in the model, we have repeated our calculations for\ndifferent values of Tmin , the virial temperature of the smallest\nminihalo, and Tuv , the critical virial temperature for suppression\nof gas infall by photoionization heating. We find that variations\nin the range 160 K \u2264 Tmin \u2264 103 K and 104 K \u2264 Tuv \u2264 2 \u00d7 105 K\nchange the required reduction factor of \u01ebmini by less than 30%.\nWe emphasize that our predicted range of \u03c4 = 0.08 \u2212 0.11,\nfor models that exclude minihalos, is consistent with numerous\nprevious semi\u2013analytic studies (as well as simulations that do\nnot resolve minihalos, e.g., Ciardi et al. 2003), in the wake\nof the 1\u2013yr announcement of the WMAP measurements. In\nanother recent study, Wyithe & Cen (2006) examined popu4\nlations of metal\u2013free stars in Tvir >\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 K halos, with an\nefficiency similar to normal stars, and found similar \u03c4 values.\nIt is also worth noting that the modified Press\u2013Schechter form\nfor the DM halo mass function that we used (Jenkins et al.\n2001) has been directly probed and confirmed in the relevant\nmass and redshift range by recent three\u2013dimensional simulations (Yoshida et al. 2003; Jang-Condell & Hernquist 2001;\nSpringel et al. 2005). However, the minihalos arise from primordial perturbations on very small (k \u223c 10 \u2212 100) scales, and\npredicting their abundance does involve an extrapolation of the\nmeasured power spectrum by \u223c 2 \u2212 3 orders of magnitude in k\n(Barkana et al. 2001; Mesinger et al. 2005).\n\nThe WMAP experiment has opened a new window into studies of the first structures at the end of the cosmological dark\nages. The first\u2013year data release has suggested the large optical\ndepth \u03c4 \u223c 0.17 (Spergel et al. 2003), which appeared in conflict\nwith simple predictions, and resulted in different suggestions to\naccount for this large \u03c4 . We argue here that the significantly\nlower \u03c4 \u2248 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 allowed by the three\u2013year data is once\nagain interesting: if minihalos were forming stars efficiently,\nthe expected value would be higher, \u03c4 >\n\u223c 0.17. To reproduce the\nnew value for \u03c4 requires an order of magnitude reduction in the\nfiducial efficiency of ionizing photon production in minihalos.\nStar\u2013formation in minihalos has been predicted theoretically\nto be significantly suppressed, and the new WMAP data has provided the first interesting empirical evidence for this suppression. In addition to the various physical feedback effects mentioned in the Introduction, the clustering of the early minihalos\nwill, in general, help suppressing more halos at high redshift,\nsince clustering will place more minihalos in the destructive\nsphere of influence of earlier collapsed objects. In the presence\nof clustering, photoionization heating alone may account for\nthe low \u03c4 (Kramer et al. 2006).\nIf massive Pop III stars typically leave behind intermediate\u2013\nmass black holes, these may accrete efficiently and produce\nmore significant ionization than their progenitor stars (Madau\net al. 2004; Ricotti & Ostriker 2004). Our results, by inference,\nprovides similarly interesting constraints on this scenario.\nFurther studies from CMB anisotropies, spectroscopic observations of quasars and Ly\u03b1 emitting galaxies at z > 6, radio\nprobes of the redshifted 21cm line of neutral hydrogen, as well\nas direct detections of the sources of reionization and their end\u2013\nproducts as supernovae and gamma ray bursts, will clarify the\nstar\u2013formation efficiency in minihalos and their contribution to\nreionization.\nZH acknowledges partial support by NASA through grants\nNNG04GI88G and NNG05GF14G, by the NSF through grants\nAST-0307291 and AST-0307200, and by the Hungarian Ministry of Education through a Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00e9k\u00e9sy Fellowship.
