At hadronic colliders the\nexperimental and/or theoretical accuracy is usually in the few percent regime, and\nthus the effect of one loop electroweak corrections of the order of O (10 \u2212 20%) at TeV\nenergies is indeed relevant for many processes. The reason for these large corrections\nto physical cross sections is primarily that they depend on the infrared cutoff, i.e. the\ngauge\nboson masses (M), leading to large DL and SL corrections of the scale ratio\n\u221a\ns/M. Only soft photon effects need to be considered in a semi-inclusive way but\neven fully inclusive cross sections are expected to depend on log Ms 2 terms [1] due to\nthe fact that the initial states carry a non-Abelian group charge (the weak isospin)\nand thus violate the Bloch-Nordsieck theorem.\nAt this point all experimental constraints indicate that a light Higgs particle below\nthe W \u00b1 threshold is responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry. If this\nscenario is realized in nature new physics is generally expected around the TeV scale in\norder to avoid the hierarchy problem. The high precision measurements of SLC/LEP\nhave limited the room for extensions of the SM considerably and in general, they\ncannot deviate from the SM to a large extent without evoking so-called conspiracy\neffects. It would therefore be very desirable to have a leptonic collider at hand in the\nfuture in order to answer questions posed by discoveries made at the LHC and possibly\nthe Tevatron. In particular, if only a light Higgs is discovered, say at 115 GeV, then\nit is mandatory to investigate all its properties in detail to experimentally establish\nthe Higgs mechanism including a possible reconstruction of the potential and of course\nof the Yukawa couplings. In addition one would have to look for additional heavy\nHiggs-bosons which could easily escape detection at the hadronic machines, but have a\nbetter chance for instance at the \u03b3\u03b3-option at TESLA [2, 3, 4]. If any supersymmetric\nparticle would be found in addition, it is necessary to clarify and/or test the relations\nbetween couplings and properties of all new particles in as much detail as possible\nin a complementary way to what would already be known by that time. The overall\nimportance of leptonic colliders would thus be to clarify the physics responsible for\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking which in turn means it must be a high precision\nmachine.\nOn the theory side this means that effects at the 1 % level should be under control\nin both the SM as well as all extensions that are viable at that point. The focus of the\npresent work is the former. In particular the abovementioned large DL and SL corrections in the SM can, at two loops, be of the order of a few %. The largest contribution\nin the high energy limit, the DL corrections, were treated comprehensively to all orders\nin Ref. [5]. The method employed in Ref. [5] is based on a non-Abelian generalization of a bremsstrahlung theorem due to Gribov [6]. The essential point here is that\ncorrections factorize with respect to the perpendicular Sudakov component |k\u22a5 | of the\n1\n\n\fexchanged gauge boson. With a cutoff imposed on the allowed values of |k\u22a5 | \u2265 \u03bc \u2265 M\nall gauge bosons in the unbroken (high energy) regime of the electroweak theory factorize according to the underlying SUL (2) \u00d7 UY (1) symmetry in analogy to QCD. The\neffect of soft photon emission can then be included in the framework of the IREE\nmethod [7] with appropriate matching conditions. This approach was extended to the\nsubleading level and to longitudinal degrees of freedom via the equivalence theorem in\nRefs. [8, 9] by employing the virtual contributions to the respective splitting functions.\nIn Ref. [9] it was furthermore shown that also top-Yukawa enhanced subleading corrections can be included in this formalism to SL accuracy to all orders. These terms\nare typical for broken gauge theories as are longitudinal degrees of freedom in general.\nAt one loop, the approach was tested with calculations in the physical SM fields\nof Refs. [10, 11]. Also at the two loop level to DL accuracy, the approach was verified\nby explicit calculations in Refs. [12, 13, 14]. To subleading accuracy it agrees with the\nresult of Ref. [15] for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 f f to all orders (up to Yukawa terms), where results\nfor the QCD form factor were generalized to the electroweak theory in a similar spirit\nas detailed above. In addition, non-universal angular terms were calculated at the one\nloop level and it was proposed to resum these terms by multiplying these corrections\nwith the DL form factor.\nThe still outstanding corrections of the universal, i.e. process independent, type\nare the focus of this work. They are given by the folding of DL-corrections with RG\nloops\n\u0011 starting at the two loop level. These contributions are of order\n\u0010 at higher orders,\n2n\u22121 s\nn\nand as such need to be included in a genuinely SL analysis. We\nO \u03b1 \u03b20 log\nM2\nwill denote them as SL-RG in the following. Conventional RG corrections, however,\nare subsubleading at the two loop level.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the case for unbroken\ngauge theories and focus on QCD in particular. We derive analytical formulas for\nboth virtual and real corrections to external quark and gluon lines depending on the\nexperimental requirements. Section 3 then applies the results according to the above\nconsiderations to the SM after briefly summarizing the results for the Sudakov corrections. We discuss the size of the results in section 4 and make concluding remarks in\nsection 5.\n\n2\n\nHigher order renormalization group corrections\nin QCD\n\nIn this section we review the case of unbroken gauge theories like QCD. Explicit comparisons with higher order calculations revealed that the relevant RG scale in the\nrespective diagrams is indeed the perpendicular Sudakov component [16, 17, 18]. We\ngive correction factors for each external line below. The universal nature of the higher\norder SL-RG corrections can be seen as follows. Consider the gauge invariant fermionic\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: A QED diagram at the two loop level yielding a SL-RG correction. The\nexplicit result obtained in Ref. [20] for the case of equal masses relative to the Born\n1 e4\n1 QED e4\namplitude was \u2212 36\nlog3 ms2 = 12\n\u03b20 16\u03c04 log3 ms2 . This result is reproduced exactly\n16\u03c0 4\nby including a running coupling into the one loop vertex correction diagram. The\nargument of the coupling must depend on the component of the loop momentum\n(going into the fermion loop) which is perpendicular to the external fermion momenta.\nIn QCD, although more diagrams contribute, the net effect is just to replace \u03b20QED \u2212\u2192\n\u03b20QCD in the above expression.\npart (\u223c nf ) as indicative of the full \u03b20QCD term (replacing nf =\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n3\nTF\n\n\u0010\n\n11\nC\n12 A\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212 \u03b20QCD ).\n\nIn order to lead to subleading, i.e. O \u03b1sn log2n\u22121 \u03bcs2 , this loop correction must be\nfolded with the exchange of a gauge boson between two external lines (producing a DL\ntype contribution) like the one depicted in Fig. 1. Using the conservation of the total\nnon-Abelian group charge, i.e.\nn\nX\n\nj=1\n\nT a (j)M(p1 , ..., pj , ..., pn ; k2\u22a5 ) = 0\n\n(1)\n\nthe double sum over all external insertions j and l is reduced to a single sum over all\nn external legs. Thus these types of corrections can be identified with external lines at\nhigher orders. The same conclusion is reproduced by the explicit pole structure of MS\nrenormalized scattering amplitudes at the two loop level in QCD [19]. In addition, from\nthe expression in Ref. [19] it can be seen that the SL-RG corrections are independent\nof the spin, i.e. for both quarks and gluons the same running coupling argument is to\nbe used. This is a consequence of the fact that these corrections appear only in loops\nwhich can yield DL corrections on the lower order level and as such, the available DL\nphase space is identical up to group theory factors. We begin with the virtual case.\n\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nVirtual corrections\n\nThe case of virtual SL-RG corrections for both massless and massive partons has been\ndiscussed in Ref. [21] with a different Sudakov parametrization. Below we show the\nidentity of both approaches. The form of the corrections is given in terms of the\nprobabilities WiV (s, \u03bc2 ). To logarithmic accuracy, they correspond to the probability\nto emit a soft and/or collinear virtual parton from particle i at high energies subject\nto an infrared cutoff \u03bc. At the amplitude level all expressions below are universal for\neach external line and exponentiate according to\nn\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1X\nWiV s, \u03bc2\nM(p1 , ..., pn , gs , \u03bc) = MBorn (p1 , ..., pn , gs ) exp \u2212\n2 i=1\n\n!\n\n(2)\n\nwhere n denotes the number of external lines. We begin with the massless case.\n2.1.1\n\nMassless QCD\n\nIn the following we denote the running QCD-coupling by\n\u03b1s (k2\u22a5 ) =\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc2 )\n1+\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc2 ) QCD\n\u03b20\n\u03c0\n\n2\nlog k\u22a5\n\n\u03bc2\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc2 )\n2\n1 + c log k\u03bc2\u22a5\n\n(3)\n\n11\nCA \u2212 31 TF nf and for QCD we have CA = 3, CF = 43 and TF =\nwhere \u03b20QCD = 12\n1\nas usual. Up to two loops the massless \u03b2-function is independent of the chosen\n2\nrenormalization scheme and is gauge invariant in minimally subtracted schemes to\nall orders [22]. These features will also hold for the derived renormalization group\ncorrection factors below in the high energy regime. The scale \u03bc denotes the infrared\ncutoff on the exchanged k\u22a5 between the external momenta pj , pl , where the Sudakov\ndecomposition is given by k = vpl + upj + k\u22a5 , such that pj k\u22a5 = pl k\u22a5 = 0. The cutoff \u03bc\n2\n> 0 which\nserves as a a lower limit on the exchanged Euclidean component k2\u22a5 = \u2212k\u22a5\ncan be defined in an invariant way as:\n\n\u03bc2 \u2264 k2\u22a5 \u2261 min(2(kpl )(kpj )/(pl pj ))\n\n(4)\n\nfor all j 6= l. In order to avoid the Landau pole we must choose \u03bc > \u039bQCD . Thus, the\nexpressions given in this section correspond for quarks to the case where m \u226a \u03bc.

This concludes the discussion of SL-RG effects in\nQCD. As a side remark we mention that for scalar quarks, the same function appears\nas for fermions since the DL-phase space for both cases is identical. Only \u03b20 differs in\neach case.\n\n3\n\nElectroweak RG corrections\n\nWe now turn to the case of spontaneously broken gauge theories. As in the previous\nsection, we are interested only in terms of SL-accuracy. At one loop, these are the\n12\n\n\fobvious RG corrections from the running couplings as discussed in Refs. [10, 8, 9].\nAt higher orders, we have the same situation as in QCD that the RG corrections are\nfolded into loops which on a lower order lead to DL contributions. We begin with a\nsummary of the known higher order DL and SL corrections.\n\n3.1\n\nSubleading electroweak Sudakov corrections to all orders\n\nIn this section we are going to discuss the higher order Sudakov corrections in the\nelectroweak theory. While the method discussed below is general, for definiteness we\nconsider only the SM. The framework we use in the following is given by the infrared\nevolution equation (IREE) method. The basic physical idea behind this framework is to\nidentify the effective high energy theory at values of k\u22a5 \u226b \u03bc \u2265 M. The corresponding\ncontribution from QED below the scale M is then given by appropriate matching\nconditions at \u03bc = M in order to recover the high energy theory solution. In this way\nall universal Sudakov DL and SL have been resummed in Refs. [5, 8, 9]. At one loop\nthe results obtained by the IREE method agree with the literature for all external\nlines and at two loops, the DL-results were checked by explicit calculations with the\nphysical SM fields [12, 13, 14]. Including soft bremsstrahlung with a cut on the allowed\nk\u22a5 \u2264 \u03bcexpt \u2264 M of the emitted real photons, and regularizing virtual IR divergences\nwith a cutoff k\u22a5 \u2265 \u03bc, we find for the semi-inclusive cross section1 :\nd\u03c3(p1 , . . . , pn , g, g \u2032, \u03bcexp) = d\u03c3Born (p1 , . . . , pn , g, g \u2032)\n(\n\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n\"\n\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n\u2212\n\nng\nX\n\n2\n\nWgi (s, M ) \u2212\n\ni=1\nnf \u0010\n\nX\ni=1\nn\u03b3\n\nX\ni=1\n\nnf\nX\ni=1\n\n2\n\nWfi (s, M ) \u2212\n\u0011\n\nwfi (s, \u03bc2) \u2212 wfi (s, M 2 ) \u2212\n#\n\n\u0010\n\nn\u03c6\nX\n\nW\u03c6i (s, M )\n\ni=1\n\nnw \u0010\nX\ni=1\n\n2\n\n)\n\nwwi (s, \u03bc2) \u2212 wwi (s, M 2 )\n\nw\u03b3i (M 2 , m2j ) \u00d7 exp w\u03b3expt (s, mi , \u03bc, \u03bcexpt )\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n(33)\n\nwhere ng denotes the number of transversely polarized gauge bosons and nf the number\nof external fermions. This expression omits all RG corrections, even at the one loop\nlevel. The functions W and w correspond to the logarithmic probability to emit a soft\nand/or collinear particle per line, where the capital letters denote the probability in\nthe high energy effective theory and the lower case letter the corresponding one from\npure QED corrections below the weak scale. The matching condition is implemented\n1\n\nWe emphasize that for photon and Z-boson final states the mixing effects have to be included\ncorrectly as described in Ref. [8]. In particular, for transverse degrees of freedom the corrections\ndon't factorize with respect to the physical Born amplitude but rather with respect to the amplitudes\ncontaining the fields in the broken phase. For longitudinally polarized Z-bosons, however, there is no\nmixing with photons and the corrections factorize with respect to the Born amplitude.\n\n13\n\n\fsuch that for \u03bc = M only the high energy solution remains. For the contribution from\nscalar fields \u03c6 = {\u03c6\u00b1 , \u03c7, H} above the scale M we have\n\u03b1\nW\u03c6i (s, M ) =\n4\u03c0\n2\n\n\"\n\nY2\nTi (Ti + 1) + tan \u03b8w i\n4\n#\n2\n3 mt\ns\n+\nlog 2\n2\n2M\nmt\n2\n\n!\u0012\n\ns\ns\nlog\n\u2212 4 log 2\n2\nM\nM\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(34)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = g 2 /4\u03c0 and tan2 \u03b8w = \u03b1\u2032 /\u03b1. The last term is written as a logarithm containing the top quark mass mt rather than the weak scale M since these terms always\ncontain mt as the heaviest mass in the loop correction [9].

In each case, the correct non-Abelian or Abelian limit is reproduced by\nletting the corresponding couplings of the other gauge group approach zero. In this\nway it is easy to see that the argument of the running couplings can only be what\nappears in Eq. (42).\n15\n\n\fThe form of Eq. (42) is valid for fermions, transversely and longitudinally polarized\nexternal lines but (omitted) subleading terms as well as the quantum numbers of the\nweak isospin Ti and the weak hypercharge Yi differ. In order to implement the missing\nsoft photon contribution, we choose the analogous form of solution in Eq. (32) and\nhave to implement it in such a way that for \u03bc = M Eq. (42) is obtained.

We are thus interested in effects starting\nat the two loop level and want to compare the relative size of the RG-improved form\nfactors to the pure\u0011 Sudakov terms. It is therefore of interest to compare the ratios\n\u0010\nRG\nRG\ne{\u2212Wi } \u2212 e{\u2212Wi } /e{\u2212Wi } for the various particle labels i. Since the physical scales\n\u221a\nin the problem are given by M and s, the lower and upper limits of the couplings\nare given accordingly by these scales for the functions Wi . Fig. 3 compares the\nrespective ratios for various SM particles. For definiteness we take M = 80 GeV,\nmt = 175 GeV, s2w = 0.23, \u03b1(M 2 ) = 1/128/s2w , \u03b1\u2032 (M 2 ) = 1/128/c2w , \u03b20 = 19/24\nand \u03b20\u2032 = \u221241/24. The difference between the curves using M 2 and those using s\nas the scales in the conventional Sudakov form factors is a measure of the inherent\nscale uncertainty which is removed by the RG-improved Sudakov form factors WiRG .\nThe largest effect is obtained in the gauge boson sector. For external {\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 , \u03c7, H}\nparticles we have at 1 TeV a difference between the curves of about 0.3% per line on\nthe level of the cross section, growing to 0.5% at 2 TeV.

The\ncomparison is made with the indicated scale choices for\n\u221a the functions Wi and takes into\naccount only the RG corrections from the scale M to s. Taking the difference between\nthe two curves is a measure of the uncertainty removed in this work. The variations\nin the scale of the coupling in the Wi functions is largest in the scalar (Goldstone and\nHiggs boson) sector and for transverse W \u00b1 where the effect is about 0.6% at 2 TeV\nper line on the level of the cross section. In general, the RG improved form factors\ndiffer by fractions of one percent per line and need to be taken into account at future\ncolliders if the experimental accuracy is in the percentile regime.\n19\n\n\fthird generation the size of the corrections is about 0.125% at 1 TeV per line on the\nlevel of the cross section and 0.25% at 2 TeV. These corrections are thus considerably\nsmaller and only needed if precisions below the one percent level are necessary from\nthe theory side. For right handed top quarks the effect is even smaller since only the\nrunning of \u03b1\u2032 enters and it is thus negligible for most applications. The form of the two\ncurves in case of right handed tops differs markedly from the other three cases because\nat the energies displayed, the dominant effect is actually due to subleading Yukawa\nenhanced corrections (\u223c \u03b1) since the DL terms are proportional to \u03b1\u2032 and since the\n\u221a\nratio m2t /M 2 is of the size of an additional logarithm for these values of s.\nIn general it can be seen that-where the DL terms dominate-the renormalization\ngroup improved results are indeed in-between the upper and lower bounds given by\nthe respective scale choices in the conventional Sudakov form factors. Indeed also for\nright handed top quarks this pattern is observed if only DL corrections are taken into\naccount.\nIt should be emphasized again that also the QED-RG corrections can be sizable\nsince large mass ratios with light particles occur. These should of course also be\nimplemented in a full SM prediction at TeV energies.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have obtained the complete subleading electroweak renormalization\ngroup corrections to all orders in high energy processes in the framework of the infrared\nevolution equation (IREE) method. These are terms originating in loops which at a\nlower loop order lead to DL corrections and are of the type \u03b1n \u03b20 log2n\u22121 Ms 2 . We\nhave derived the corrections for massless as well as massive gauge theories and used\nappropriate matching conditions to obtain the full SM contributions. These corrections\nstart at the two loop level and are universal, i.e. properties of external lines and thus\nprocess independent. They represent the last missing universal contribution needed\nfor a full SL-analysis at the two loop level. The size of the effect at TeV energies is in\ngeneral a fraction of one percent and is largest in the scalar and gauge boson sector,\nwhere at 2 TeV the uncertainty in the conventional Sudakov form factor is about 0.6%\nper line at the level of the cross section. These effects cannot be neglected at TeV\nlinear colliders for precision measurements in the percentile regime.\nThe last outstanding type of SL-correction at the two loop level is given by the\nnon-universal, process dependent angular terms of the type \u03b1n log2n\u22121 Ms 2 log ut . These\nterms also don't factorize with respect to the Born cross amplitude and the high\nprecision objectives of future linear colliders will make at least a two loop analysis of\nthese corrections mandatory.\n\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank A.
