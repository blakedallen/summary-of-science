The notion of screening mechanisms - how a light scalar\ndegree of freedom \u03c6 can act as dark energy on cosmological scales while being shielded\nin dense environments such as on earth - has turned out to be especially useful in this\ncontext. Implementations of such a mechanism include the following: 1) The chameleon\nmodel [3, 4], where a density dependent mass is generated and the field \u03c6 becomes too\nmassive for detection in dense environments. 2) Vainshtein screened setups [5, 6, 7] such as\nDGP [8] and Galileon [9]/Horndeski [10] models, where non-linear interactions of \u03c6 lead to\nstrongly coupled dynamics. A density-dependent (classical) renormalization of the kinetic\nenergy there results in an effectively decoupled scalar in dense environments. 3) Symmetron\n1\n\n\fmodels [11, 12], where a scalar \u03c6 is coupled to matter with a coupling strength proportional\nto the vacuum expectation value of \u03c6. This in turn depends on the ambient density, so\nthat the scalar effectively decouples in high-density regions. All these mechanisms reconcile\nthe existence of a light cosmological scalar with tight fifth force constraints on solar-system\nscales [13].\nIn this paper we wish to focus on chameleon models and potential extensions thereof.\nChameleon phenomenology has already been studied extensively [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] for variants of the model introduced by [3, 4]. Typically\nsuch theories are built by universally coupling matter to a metric conformally related to\nthe Einstein metric g\u03bc\u03bd . Making this bimetric structure explicit we here investigate whether\nthere are any interesting and qualitatively new implementations of the chameleon mechanism\nthat arise when going beyond the simple conformal relationships considered so far. Can the\nchameleon effect occur in new guises for generic 4D effective field theories? In other words,\nwe will be asking two questions: What forms can the conformal relation generically take?\nAnd does it have to be conformal or are there more general bimetric structures that can\nproduce chameleonic phenomenology?\nA systematic way of undertaking this investigation is to construct a generic matter metric\nas a function of the Einstein metric g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6 and derivatives of the field \u2202 n \u03c6. By showing how\nwhat we dub derivative chameleons arise in this framework, this paper aims to illustrate how\nsuch an approach unveils qualitatively new constructions. More specifically we show that\nderivative chameleons naturally give rise to a new mass-altering mechanism, which changes\nthe mass of oscillations around an effective potential minimum. The mass-lifting branch\nmay help in ensuring \u03c6 can escape detection in fifth force experiments and consequently\nmay be of use in alleviating fine-tuning constraints for chameleon models. However, we\nalso show that care needs to be taken in order to avoid ghost-like instabilities for masslifting solutions. The mass-lowering branch of solutions, on the other hand, is generically\nstable. Importantly the new mechanism works for purely derivative conformal factors too,\nopening up the exciting possibility of having a chameleon mechanism which comes endowed\nwith a shift-symmetry in the field \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + c, offering better protection from quantumcorrections. Furthermore we discuss modifications to the radial solutions around spherical\nmatter sources and modifications to the thin-shell mechanism. We also point out why nonconformal geometries are not expected to display chameleon-screening, establishing a no-go\ntheorem for so-called disformal geometries.\nThe plan for the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review the standard chameleon\npicture and how this gives rise to an effective potential with a large mass for oscillations\naround the effective minimum. Section 3 then introduces the bimetric framework, explicitly\nformulating metric relations which are used to construct chameleon models thereafter. This\nconstruction takes place in 4, while focusing on conformally related metrics, pointing out\nthe phenomenology of our generalized chameleon model, in particular the new mass-altering\nmechanism. In 5 this is followed up by presenting a few simple concrete examples that implement this new-found mechanism and show how it can be realized for purely derivative\n2\n\n\fconformal factors. Modifications to thin-shell screening are then discussed while investigating radial solutions around a massive source in section 6. In 7 we go beyond conformal\nrelationships, arguing that their natural extension - disformally related geometries - cannot\nproduce chameleon phenomenology (they do, however, naturally generate Vainshtein-type\nscreening solutions). Finally we conclude in 8 .\n\n2\n\nConformal chameleons I: The minimal theory\n\nChameleon models [3, 4] are typically constructed with the use of two conformally related\nmetrics, where the conformal factor is a function of the chameleon field \u03c6 only. In particular\nwe may consider an action of the following form\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\n\u0001\nM\n4 \u221a\nS= dx g\nR + X \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Sm A2 (\u03c6)g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8i ,\n(2.1)\n2\nwhere X = \u2212 21 \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6 is the usual canonical kinetic term for \u03c6, V (\u03c6) is some arbitrary\npotential and Sm describes the matter part of the action with all matter species \u03a8i universally\ncoupled to the matter metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6)g\u03bc\u03bd . This universal coupling ensures the validity\nof the weak equivalence principle by design. Also note that the signature of g\u03bc\u03bd used here\n\u0010 \u00112\n~\nis (\u2212 + ++), and hence 2X = \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 \u2207\u03c6\n. As usual a matter stress-energy tensor can be\ndefined with respect to the matter (\"Jordan frame\") metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , so that\n2 \u03b4Lm\n.\nT\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = \u221a\ng\u0303 \u03b4g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.2)\n\nSince it minimally couples to g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , it is covariantly conserved with respect to that metric\n \u0303 \u03bc T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0. When mapping T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd into the Einstein frame one finds\n\u2207\nT\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = A\u22126 (\u03c6)T \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis means T \u03bc\u03bd is not covariantly conserved in the Einstein frame \u2207\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd 6= 0. Turning our\nattention back to the original action (2.1), one can now work out the equation of motion for\nthe scalar \u03c6 obtaining\n2\u03c6 = V,\u03c6 \u2212 A3 (\u03c6)A,\u03c6 T\u0303 ,\n(2.4)\nwhere the matter stress-energy tensor is defined as in (2.2) and has been contracted with the\nmatter metric T\u0303 = T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd . Specializing to the case of a pressureless, non-relativistic source,\nthe only non-vanishing component of the stress-energy tensor T\u0303\u03bd\u03bc is T\u030300 = \u2212\u03c1\u0303. Following\nfrom (2.3) the energy density of matter in the Einstein frame, \u03c1, is given by \u03c1 = A4 \u03c1\u0303. As\n \u0303 \u03bc T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0 we then also find a conserved quantity in the Einstein\na direct consequence of \u2207\nframe \u03c1\u0302 = A3 \u03c1\u0303 = A\u22121 \u03c1. In terms of this conserved quantity (2.4) can therefore be written\nas\n2\u03c6 = V,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302,\n(2.5)\n3\n\n\fand one can integrate up to obtain an effective potential for \u03c6\nVeff (\u03c6) = V (\u03c6) + \u03c1\u0302A(\u03c6),\n\n(2.6)\n\nsince \u03c1\u0302 is conserved and independent of \u03c6 in the Einstein frame.\nThis setup has interesting phenomenological consequences. Suppose we start with a\nn\nrunaway potential V (\u03c6), e.g. V (\u03c6) = MPn+4\nl /\u03c6 as desirable from the point of view of\nquintessence models [28]. This ensures that, in the limit when we can ignore the matter\naction Sm (a low-density environment with \u03c1\u0302 \u2192 0 in the language set out above), we recover\na quintessence-like solution to the cosmological constant problem. A slow-rolling light scalar\nfield then drives accelerated expansion of space-time. But in regions of high density this\nbehavior changes in the following way. Naively \u03c6 does not possess a mass term at all, since\nV (\u03c6) has no minimum (except for the trivial one at \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e). However, from (2.5) it becomes\nclear that, for non-zero \u03c1\u0302, a suitably chosen A(\u03c6) can result in a Vef f which does have a\nminimum \u03c6min , such that\nVef f,\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) = V,\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + A,\u03c6 (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u0302 = 0,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere the mass of the field m for small oscillations around the minimum \u03c6min is given by\nm2 \u2261 Vef f,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) = V,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + \u03c1\u0302A,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ).\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis is the essence of the chameleon mechanism: An environmentally-dependent way of\ngenerating a large mass for an otherwise very light scalar \u03c6. This reconciles a model such\nas (2.1) with fifth force constraints, since \u03c6 becomes too heavy for detection in laboratory\nexperiments on earth, yet can act as dark energy on large scales. Figure 1 illustrates the\nchameleon mechanism for a conformal factor of the form A(\u03c6) \u223c ek1 \u03c6 .\nTwo final comments are in order here. Firstly our argument has been purely phenomenological in that a suitably chosen conformal factor can give rise to the chameleon mechanism\ndescribed, but no arguments for why such an A(\u03c6) is (technically) natural have been given.\nThis issue is beyond the scope of this paper, but we refer to [29] for a discussion. Secondly\nwe have not discussed the thin-shell mechanism so far, which is another essential ingredient\nfor the viability of the chameleon mechanism in that it suppresses fifth force modifications\nto e.g. planetary orbits. We will do so in section 6 where radial solutions are investigated in\nsome detail.\n\n3\n\nThe disformal/bimetric perspective\n\nThe chameleon mechanism presented in the previous section hinges on the existence of two\nconformally related metrics g\u03bc\u03bd and g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , respectively used to construct the gravitational part\nof the action (the Ricci scalar) and the matter part of the action (i.e. matter fields \u03a8i are\nminimally coupled to g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ). The question we want to answer in this paper is: What happens\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Left: Plot showing the effective potential Vef f (\u03c6) (solid line), the conformal factor A(\u03c6) = ek1 \u03c6\n(dotted line) and a runaway potential V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u22123 (dashed line) in arbitrary units, cf. equation (2.6).\nRight: Plot showing the effective potential for k1 = 1 \u2212 6 from bottom to top. Note how the position of\nthe minimum \u03c6min is shifted to smaller \u03c6 and the curvature and hence mass of oscillations around \u03c6min is\nenhanced as k1 increases.\n\nwhen this relationship is modified? To be more specific, are there other classes of scalartensor theories that offer qualitatively distinct implementations of the chameleon mechanism\n(which we take to be an environmentally dependent generation of mass for an otherwise light\ncosmological scalar \u03c6)?\n\n3.1\n\nA bimetric scalar-tensor theory\n\nIn this section we want to lay out the problem in more general terms without imposing as\nrestrictive a metric relation as in section 2. Consequently let us start with a schematic action\nof the following form\nZ\n\u221a M2\nR + Sm (g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8i ) + S\u03c6\n(3.1)\nS = d4 x g\n2\nwhere \u03a8i are matter fields minimally coupled to g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd as before and S\u03c6 denotes an action giving\nthe scalar field \u03c6 dynamics of its own. We emphasize that there is no a priori requirement\nconstraining S\u03c6 to be formed with either g\u03bc\u03bd or g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd . To enable comparison with the existing\nchameleon literature we fix the form of S\u03c6 such that\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\nM\n4 \u221a\nS= dx g\nR + X \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Sm (g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8i ) ,\n(3.2)\n2\ni.e. S\u03c6 equips \u03c6 with a canonical kinetic term and a potential minimally coupled to g\u03bc\u03bd . In\norder to investigate (3.2) it now becomes necessary to specify how g\u03bc\u03bd and g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd are related,\nand in particular how \u03c6 enters this relation. For this it will be useful to schematically\nwrite (3.2) as\nZ\nZ\np\n4 \u221a\nS = d x gLE (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6) + d4 x g\u0303Lm (g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8i ) .\n(3.3)\n5\n\n\f3.2\n\nThe metric relation\n\nIn section 2 gravity and matter metrics were conformally related by\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6)g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(3.4)\n\nHere we are interested in investigating more general metric relations. A systematic way of\nconstructing a more general matter metric in the presence of a gravitational scalar \u03c6 is to\nwrite\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6, \u2202\u03c6, \u2202\u2202\u03c6, ...),\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhich is therefore a function of the gravity metric g\u03bc\u03bd , the field \u03c6 and its derivatives.1 We\nwill truncate this expansion in derivatives at first order, i.e. 2\u03c6 contributions and other\nhigher order terms are ignored. If (3.2) is an effective field theory then subsequently higher\nderivatives of the field can be suppressed by higher powers of the cutoff scale, motivating\nsuch a truncation. Note, however, that such an argument naturally does not discriminate\nbetween e.g. (\u2202\u03c6)n and \u2202 n \u03c6. So in addition, and more heuristically perhaps, we will allow\noperators such as (\u2202\u03c6)n , while disregarding \u2202 n \u03c6 for n = 2 in particular. This setup trivially\nprotects us from having equations of motion with higher than second order derivatives of\nthe field, where we would expect ghost-like instabilities via Ostrogradski's theorem [31].\nArguing in a similar fashion, Bekenstein postulated [32] that the most general gravitational and matter metrics satisfying these conditions2 give rise to a bimetric theory where\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd and g\u03bc\u03bd are \"disformally\" related by\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd + B 2 (\u03c6, X)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere we again recognize X as \u03c6's kinetic term. Note that we have implicitly required the\nmetric relation to only be a function of coordinate invariants (hence the dependence of A2\nand B 2 on X and not \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 by itself). This generalized metric relation therefore consists\nof a conformal piece, with A2 (\u03c6, X) being the conformal factor, and a so-called disformal\npiece, where we shall call B 2 (\u03c6, X) the disformal factor. Interestingly the disformal piece\nof the metric relation exactly mimics the structure of induced metrics in models that are\nintrinsically higher-dimensional in nature. For example, in higher-dimensional dark energy\nsetups such as DGP [8] or DBI galileons [33] the induced metric on our 4-brane is g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd =\ng\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6, i.e. exactly of the disformal type with a trivial disformal factor B 2 = 1.\n1\n\nWhile this paper was being finished an analogous construction for a metric that is a composite of several\nother fields \u03c6i was investigated in [30].\n2\nIn fact Bekenstein assumes what is essentially a 4D effective field theory in an overall Finslerian geometry\nwith gravity and matter metrics related by a single degree of freedom \u03c6 up to first order in its derivatives.\nHe then proceeds to show that this has to reduce to a Riemannian geometry described by (3.6). For details\nsee [32].\n\n6\n\n\f3.3\n\nGeneralized equations of motion\n\nWith a matter stress-energy tensor defined as in (2.2) and metrics related by (3.6), we can\nnow write down the equations of motion for the general action (3.2). Varying (3.2) we find\ns\ns\ns\n!\n1 g\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202LE 1 g\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202LE 1 \u2202g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\ng\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n+\n= \u2207\u03b1\n+\n\u2207\u03b1\n.

It is, however, worth\nemphasizing that T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd is explicitly a stress energy tensor not including any contributions\nfrom S\u03c6 in (3.1), so it does not satisfy the Einstein equations by itself.\n\u0010 Instead, after \u0011having\n(matter)\n\nmapped all quantities into the Einstein frame, one finds G\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0G T\u03bc\u03bd\n\n4\n\n(\u03c6)\n\n+ T\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nConformal chameleons II: Derivative setups\n\nHere we wish to focus on the effect of reducing the bimetric relationship (3.6) to the simple\ncase B(\u03c6, X) = 0. This is the most general purely conformal relation permitted by (3.6).\nThe conformal factor A2 (\u03c6, X) is an arbitrary function of the field \u03c6 and the first higher\norder coordinate invariant X, \u03c6's kinetic term, and we have\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(4.1)\n\nAs such this means the full action under consideration is that of a generalized conformal\nchameleon\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\n\u0001\nM\n4 \u221a\nS= dx g\nR + X \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Sm A2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8i .\n(4.2)\n2\nThe relation between matter stress-energy tensors in different frames straightforwardly generalizes to T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = A\u22126 (\u03c6, X)T \u03bc\u03bd . We will now first compute the associated equation of motion\nfor \u03c6 and then comment on the impact a generalized conformal factor has on the chameleon\nmechanism.\n\n4.1\n\nEquation of motion and effective potential\n\nThe equation of motion for \u03c6 that follows from (4.2) can be written in the following form\nusing (3.7)\nX\n\u2212 V,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 A3 T\u0303 = \u22122\u03c6 +\nJi ,\n(4.3)\ni\n\nwhere 2 \u2261 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc and\nJ1 = \u2212A,X A3 T\u0303 2\u03c6\n7\n\n\fJ2 = 2A2 T\u0303 (AA,X\u03c6 + 3A,X A,\u03c6 ) X\n\u0001\nJ3 = A2 T\u0303 AA,XX + 3A2,X \u03a0\n \u0303 \u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd ,\nJ4 = \u2212A3 A,X g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2207\n\n(4.4)\n\nand we have defined \u03a0 \u2261 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 = \u2207\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6. We have assumed that T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd is\nsymmetric and expressed derivatives acting on T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd in terms of matter frame variables to\navoid mixing operators and variables defined for different frames. More explicitly this means\nusing\n \u0303 \u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\u0393(\u03bc T\u0303 \u03bd)\u03b2 ,\n\u2207\u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = \u2207\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1 is the connection associated with transformations between g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (\u223c Jordan) and g\u03bc\u03bd\n(Einstein) frames (for details please see the appendix). Additionally there are two further\ntypes of terms one might naively expect to arise from varying (4.2)\nJ5 \u221d A4 A2,X T\u0303 \u03b2\u03bd \u03a0\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03b2 \u03c6\u2202 \u03c1 \u03c6\nJ6 \u221d A4 A,X A,\u03c6 \u2202\u03b2 \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6T\u0303 \u03b2\u03bd ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere \u03a0\u03bd\u03c1 \u2261 \u2207\u03bd \u2207\u03c1 \u03c6 = \u2207\u03bd \u2202\u03c1 \u03c6. However, the symmetry imposed on the conformal factor\n(i.e. A only being a function of coordinate invariants) means that contributions proportional\nto J5 and J6 cancel and hence do not appear in the equation of motion. As an immediate\nconsequence there is no direct, Vainshtein-like coupling between the stress-energy tensor\nand derivatives of the field, but matter only enters via T\u0303 .3 Taking g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd inside its covariant\n \u0303 = \u2207s = \u2202s for any scalar s (i.e. covariant derivatives related\nderivative and using that \u2207s\nto both metrics act on scalars in the same way), the overall equation of motion can therefore\nbe written\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3\n3\n\u2212 V,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 A T\u0303 = \u2212 1 + A T\u0303 A,X 2\u03c6\n+ 2A2 T\u0303 (AA,X\u03c6 + 3A,X A,\u03c6 ) X\n\u0001\n+ A2 T\u0303 AA,XX + 3A2,X \u03a0\n\u2212 A3 A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 T\u0303 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nWe now proceed to simplify these expressions by considering a uniform matter source,\nmaking the following key assumption about the system under consideration\n\u2022 The stress-energy tensor describes a pressureless, non-relativistic fluid (T\u030300 = \u2212\u03c1\u0303) with\nall other stress-energy tensor components vanishing.\n3\n\nNote that, at any rate, the Vainshtein-like coupling referred to here would be a derivative coupling which\nleads to a screening, i.e. a classical renormalization of the kinetic energy, that depends locally on T \u03bc\u03bd . This\nmeans that there will be no screening effect even a small distance away from the source. This is in contrast\nto Vainshtein screening sourced by derivative self-interactions of the scalar \u03c6, e.g. a X2\u03c6 term in the action,\nwhich will lead to screening inside a Vainshtein radius rV that can extend beyond the source itself, subject\nto introducing an appropriate coupling between matter and \u03c6 such as the linear \u03c6T\u0303 .\n\n8\n\n\fLater on (in section 6) we will also assume a static, uniform source in the matter frame\n \u0303 \u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0 inside the source). Combining this with the first assumption, this is equivalent\n(\u2207\n \u0303 \u03b1 \u03c1\u0303 = \u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0303 = 0 (again, inside the source). This means J4 = 0 everywhere\nto assuming \u2207\nexcept in the transition between source and surroundings. For this reason we will keep the\nfull J4 term when evaluating radial profiles across this boundary and not make any further\nassumptions about J4 for the time being. Note that we also do not assume a static profile\nfor \u03c6 (\u22020 \u03c6 = 0), which one may want to impose for further simplification in a late-universe\nsystem like the solar system, which has had time to settle. Modeling matter as a pressureless,\nnon-relativistic fluid results in\nJ1 = A,X \u03c1\u03022\u03c6\n\u0001\nJ2 = \u22122\u03c1\u0302 A,X\u03c6 + 3A\u22121 A,X A,\u03c6 X\n\u0001\nJ3 = \u2212\u03c1\u0302 A,XX + 3A\u22121 A2,X \u03a0\n\u0001\nJ4 = A3 A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 A\u22123 \u03c1\u0302 ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere we have substituted A3 T\u0303 = \u2212\u03c1\u0302 (or equivalently \u03c1\u0302 = A3 \u03c1\u0303), since \u03c1\u0302 is a conserved\nquantity in the Einstein frame. Explicitly working out J4 , which will be relevant when\nmodeling the transition across matter boundaries, one finds\nJ4 = 6A\u22121 A,X A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302X + 3A\u22121 A2,X \u03c1\u0302\u03a0 + A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis considerably simplifies the equations of motion, revealing additional symmetries that\narise due to the functional form of A in combination with requiring a non-relativistic, pressureless fluid as the matter source. Consequently the equation of motion for \u03c6 may be written\nas\nV,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X ) 2\u03c6 + 2\u03c1\u0302A,X\u03c6 X + \u03c1\u0302A,XX \u03a0 \u2212 A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302.\n\n(4.10)\n\nAn instructive way to think of the physical properties of this system is to explicitly write\nit as a Klein-Gordon equation with an effective potential that only depends on \u03c6 and \"friction\nterms\" that encode the dependence on higher derivatives of \u03c6. If we are purely interested in\nthe profile inside the source (and hence ignore \u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302), this means we can write\nVef f,\u03c6 (\u03c6) = 2\u03c6 + F1 (\u03c6, X, \u03c1\u0302) X + F2 (\u03c6, X, \u03c1\u0302) \u03a0\n= 2\u03c6 + \"friction terms\".\n\n(4.11)\n\nTo make the form of the effective potential explicit, one can Taylor-expand the conformal\nfactor A in powers of X, writing\nA(\u03c6, X) = A(0) (\u03c6) + A(1) (\u03c6)X + O(X 2 ),\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich allows us to write down the effective potential for \u03c6 as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\u22121\n(0)\nVef f,\u03c6 (\u03c6) = V,\u03c6 + \u03c1\u0302A,\u03c6\n1 \u2212 A(1) \u03c1\u0302\n.\n\n(4.13)\n\n9\n\n\f4.2\n\nPhenomenology and comments\n\nGiven some original potential of the runaway form V (\u03c6), the chameleon mechanism generates\nan environmentally dependent effective potential that gives \u03c6 a large mass in high density\nregions. Here \"high density\" and \"large mass\" are essentially references to solar system constraints [13] on the presence of a fifth force mediated by a scalar degree of freedom. As such,\nany theory with a runaway V (\u03c6) that successfully implements the chameleon mechanism at\nthe very least has to tick two boxes. Firstly it needs to give rise to an environmentallydependent effective potential which has a minimum. And secondly the mass of small oscillations around that minimum has to be large enough to satisfy fifth force constraints. With\nthis in mind let us investigate the effective potential described by (4.10) and (4.13). Note\nthat in section 5 we will give explicit examples illustrating each of the effects outlined here\nin detail.\nPosition of minimum: For a finite density \u03c1\u0302 and conformal factor A (more precisely,\n(1)\nA ), (4.13) shows that a potential minimum requires\n(0)\n\nV,\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + \u03c1\u0302A,\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) = 0,\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhich is identical to the condition for the minimal conformal chameleon discussed in section 2.\nIn other words, the position of the minimum, \u03c6min , is not altered by the introduction of an\nX-dependent conformal factor. This also shows that a conformal factor which does not\n(0)\ndepend on \u03c6 itself, but only on derivatives of \u03c6, (i.e. A,\u03c6 = 0, as is the case for A = A(X))\ncannot generate an effective potential with a minimum, if the original V (\u03c6) does not already\npossess a minimum itself. The \u03c6-dependence of A is consequently essential to obtaining a\nsuccessful implementation of the chameleon mechanism, if starting with a runaway potential\n(e.g. V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u2212n ). A potential V (\u03c6) with very small mass m2V can however be uplifted by\na pure derivative conformal factor (e.g. A(X)), leading to an effective potential with mass\nm2 \u001d m2V . Below and in the next section we will give explicit examples illustrating this\nbehavior.\nEffective mass: A derivative-dependent conformal factor affects the curvature of the\neffective potential. This means derivative chameleons generically come equipped with a\nnew mass-altering mechanism. The effective potential, and hence the mass of the field, is\nclassically renormalized by introducing higher order invariants into the conformal relation\nas follows\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\u22121\n(0)\nm2 = Vef f,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) = V,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + \u03c1\u0302A,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) 1 \u2212 A(1) (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u0302\n\u0001\u22121\n= m2standard 1 \u2212 A(1) (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u0302\n,\n(4.15)\nwhere m2standard denotes the effective mass for small oscillations around the minimum for a\ntheory with identical conformal factor in the limit A(\u03c6, X \u2192 0). In other words, m2standard\nis the effective mass for the theory in the limit where higher-derivative contributions can be\nneglected. This mass-altering mechanism can be separated into three branches, which we\nwill discuss now.\n10\n\n\fMass-lifting, ghost-like instabilities and anti-chameleons: Equation (4.15) shows\nthat the effective mass m2 is enlarged when 0 < A(1) (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u0302 < 1. This is interesting since\nit suggests that derivative chameleon models provide an additional mass-lifting mechanism,\npotentially alleviating the fine-tuning involved in obtaining a sufficiently large mass in dense\nenvironments for standard chameleon models. However, care must be taken when considering\nmass-lifting solutions for the following reason. Suppose we consider a conformal factor A\nsuch that a mass-lifting mechanism is in place, i.e. 0 < A(1) (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u03021 < 1 for some given\nenergy density \u03c1\u03021 . Now, assuming A has no density-dependence itself, one can solve for\na (larger) critical density \u03c1\u0302crit above which the solution becomes unstable. The effective\npotential switches sign since 1 \u2212 A(1) (\u03c6min ) becomes negative, so that \u03c6min becomes \u03c6max\nand Vef f,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) turns negative. Thus we are left with a negative \"mass term\", signaling\ninstabilities, and the solution becomes ghost-like. Figure 2 illustrates these different regimes.\nThat different energy densities \u03c1\u0302 will interpolate between stable mass-lifting and ghost-like\nsolutions can also be seen from the relevant part of the equation of motion\nV,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X ) 2\u03c6 + ...,\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere, if \u03c1\u0302A,X > 1, this can be traced back to an action with the \"wrong\" sign for \u03c6's kinetic\nterm.4\nThere appear to be two obvious solutions to this instability problem.5 Firstly one could\nconsider making A(\u03c6, X) a function of the energy density \u03c1\u0302 as well. However, especially\ngiven that the matter stress-energy tensor T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd is a variation of the matter Lagrangian with\nrespect to the metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd , it is not clear what such an iterative dependence\non T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd would mean. Nevertheless it will be an interesting task for the future to think about\nwhether there is some convincing way of implementing such a dependence. In any case,\nfrom a purely phenomenological point of view, a density dependent A allows us to have a\nstable, derivative dependent mass-lifting mechanism for all \u03c1\u0302. Secondly one may choose a\n<1 up to the density cutoff of the theory. Note, however,\nconformal factor such that \u03c1\u0302A,X \u223c\nthat the effective chameleon mass m2 is proportional to (\u03c1\u0302crit \u2212 \u03c1\u0302)\u22121 , where we have defined\na critical density \u03c1\u0302crit such that A(1) (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u0302crit = 1. Introducing a cutoff at \u03c1\u0302crit will then\nrender derivative-dependent effects on m2 suppressed by that same cutoff scale\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nm2standard\n\u03c1\u0302\n2\n2\nm =\n= mstandard 1 \u2212\n.\n(4.17)\n(\u03c1\u0302cutof f \u2212 \u03c1\u0302) A(1) (\u03c6min )\n\u03c1\u0302cutof f\nIf the cutoff is low enough, significant derivative-dependent effects on m2 may still be obtained, but for a high cutoff density such as the Planck density \u03c1P they will be strongly\n4\n\nJumping ahead slightly, also note that, if A,X is a function of \u03c6 and the field is not approximately\nconstant \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6min inside the source (the so-called \"thick-shell regime - see section 6), one needs to be aware\nthat \u03c1\u0302A,X (\u03c6) being smaller than unity for some initial \u03c6i (r = 0) no longer guarantees that this remains true\nfor all values of \u03c6 taken inside the source.\n5\nShould we decide to bite the bullet and accept the existence of ghost-like solutions above some densityscale \u03c1\u0302, such an approach will also face major challenges when confronted with high energy/density early\nuniverse physics.\n\n11\n\n\fsuppressed.\nThe third branch of mass-altering solutions corresponds to the case when A(1) (\u03c6min ) < 0?\nThen the effective mass of \u03c6 is reduced, counter-acting chameleon screening effects\nm2 =\n\nm2standard\n.\n1 + |A(1) (\u03c6min )\u03c1\u0302|\n\n(4.18)\n\nThis branch is free of instabilities and provides a robust mechanism to suppress mass terms\nin models with derivative conformal factors A, since the derivative dependence reduces the\ncurvature of Vef f . This suggests that the simplest A2 (\u03c6, X) models, where A is independent\nof \u03c1\u0302 and no ghost-like instabilities arise for any \u03c1\u0302, are anti-chameleon models in the sense\nthat the effective mass m2 is reduced compared with the non-derivative chameleon limit\nA(\u03c6, X \u2192 0).\nThin shell regime: The computation of Vef f and its minima/maxima and masses above\nwas oblivious to \"friction\" terms in (4.11) (by definition, since the effective potential is a\nfunction of \u03c6 and not its derivatives). But such terms automatically arise as a consequence\nof a higher order conformal coupling. Here \"friction terms\" is a reference to terms other than\n2\u03c6 that have a derivative dependence on \u03c6, e.g. J2 and J3 which encode the dependence on\nX and \u03a0. While not influencing Vef f , these terms do impact the dynamics of \u03c6, warranting\nfurther investigation.\nOne particularly interesting consequence is a modification of the so-called thin-shell\nregime. In typical chameleon theories the chameleon-charge of large, massive objects can\nbe Yukawa-screened with only a thin-shell on the outside of the object contributing to the\nexterior \u03c6-profile [3, 4]. This is essential for e.g. avoiding unacceptably large effects on planetary orbits due to a chameleonic fifth force. Now the presence of additional friction terms\nmodifies the gradient of \u03c6 inside the source and one therefore expects a modification of the\nthin-shell effect as well. We will discuss this in detail in section 6, where we investigate radial\nsolutions around massive sources, focusing on new-found phenomenology due to derivative\nconformal factors.\nEquivalence principle (violations): A final comment on possible equivalence principle violations. By construction, chameleon models (both standard as well as the derivative\ngeneralization considered here) respect the weak equivalence principle. In the non-derivative\ncase, the extra degree of freedom \u03c6 locally influences the dynamics, but it does not discriminate between different test masses/types of matter due to the universal coupling of A2 (\u03c6) to\nall matter fields \u03a8i (field-dependent couplings are discussed in [34]). In the derivative case,\nan additional degree of freedom X enters. But since all matter still universally couples to\nA2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd , all test masses locally experience the same gravitational force (note that \u03c6 is\nviewed as a gravitational scalar here). In both cases \u03c6's profile of course does not remain\nconstant across space-time, as it depends on the ambient density. This means the strong\nequivalence principle is trivially violated (as is, in fact, the Einstein equivalence principle\n- cf. with e.g. the Horndeski constructions in [35] where the strong, but not the Einstein\nequivalence principle is broken).\n12\n\n\fThe main point we wish to make here is that a prima facie worry one might have when\nconsidering A2 (\u03c6, X), namely that a derivative-dependent coupling to matter violates even\nthe weak equivalence principle, is not justified. This is simply due to the fact that there is\nno dependence of the gravitational coupling on the momentum of matter (\u03a8i ) test masses,\nbut only a derivative coupling to the gravitational scalar \u03c6. Nevertheless this is an area that\nwarrants further investigation, since known violations of the strong equivalence principle\nin chameleon models (cf. [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]) will be modified by introducing a derivative\ndependence. Computing this in detail should enable further disentangling of derivative vs.\nnon-derivative chameleons.\n\n5\n\nEffective potentials and the chameleon mass\n\nIn this section we illustrate how chameleon mechanisms arise in derivative theories with\na number of explicit examples. We focus on the mass-altering mechanism for different\nconformal factors.\n\n5.1\n\nExample I: Taylor-expanding A(\u03c6, X)\n\nWe begin by reminding ourselves of (4.12) and Taylor-expanding the conformal factor\nA(\u03c6, X) = A(0) (\u03c6) + A(1) (\u03c6)X + O(X 2 ),\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the associated mass of oscillations around an effective minimum is given by (4.13).\nWe will ignore higher orders in X and, as a first simple example, focus on the zeroth order\ncontribution in \u03c6 to A(1) , treating it as a constant. As such the conformal factor takes on\nthe form\nA(\u03c6, X) = A(0) (\u03c6) + kX X.\n(5.2)\nThe resulting potential and effective mass can be computed to give\nVef f (\u03c6) =\n\nV (\u03c6) + \u03c1\u0302A(0) (\u03c6)\n,\n1 \u2212 kx \u03c1\u0302\n\n(5.3)\n\n(0)\n\n2\n\nm\n\nV,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + \u03c1\u0302A,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min )\nm2\n=\n= standard .\n1 \u2212 kX \u03c1\u0302\n1 \u2212 kX \u03c1\u0302\n\n(5.4)\n\nThis illustrates the point made in the previous section about the existence of a mass-raising\nand a mass-lowering branch for derivative chameleon models. In the simple setup considered\nhere, if kX is negative, the chameleon mass m2 is reduced compared with the standard\nA = A(\u03c6) theory. The fine-tuning necessary in order to get a sufficiently large chameleon\nmass is therefore made more severe in this case, since an additional mass-lowering mechanism\nis at work. For positive kX a mass-lifting mechanism operates, increasing m2 . However, for\nkX \u03c1\u0302 = 1 the mass diverges and, once kX \u03c1\u0302 exceeds unity, the \"mass\" turns negative and\nthe solution ghost-like. As discussed in the previous section, this is cause for concern, since\n13\n\n\fgiven some gravitational theory the conformal factor is fully specified (and hence kX is fixed\nin this case). As such, sources with densities above \u03c1\u0302crit = 1/kX essentially see an unstable\ninverted potential \u2212Vef f inside the source. The bottom left graph of figure 2 illustrates\nthis point by plotting the dependence of the effective potential on kX for some given source\ndensity \u03c1\u03021 . This amounts to considering different normalizations of the effective potential.\nOn the other hand, the bottom right plot shows how varying \u03c1\u0302 for some given, positive and\nfixed kX affects the solution. Note that having restricted to positive kX means there are no\nmass-lowering solutions present in this plot. As expected from (5.3), changing \u03c1\u0302 modifies\nboth the position of the minimum as well as as changing the potential's normalization and\nhence curvature/mass via the 1 \u2212 kx \u03c1\u0302 term.\nAs an aside, notice that, if one does allow the conformal factor to depend on energy\ndensity \u03c1\u0302 (for a discussion of this approach see the previous section), then one can construct\na solution which remains ghost-free inside sources with arbitrarily large energy densities \u03c1\u0302.\nE.g. we may impose\n\u0001\nA(\u03c6, X) = ek1 \u03c6 + \u03c1\u0302\u22121 1 \u2212 ek2 \u03c6 X + O(X 2 ),\n(5.5)\nwhich results in an effective mass given by\n\u0001\nm2 = ek2 \u03c6min V,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + k12 \u03c1\u0302ek1 \u03c6min .\n\n(5.6)\n\nIn other words, in this particular example k2 allows tuning the mass m2 arbitrarily. The\npotential is stable for all \u03c6 and the mass can be altered by modifying the X-dependence of\nthe conformal factor A2 .6\n\n5.2\n\nExample II: A separable A(\u03c6, X)\n\nIn the Taylor-expanded picture laid out in the previous section, considering a separable\nconformal factor A(\u03c6, X) amounts to setting A(0) (\u03c6) = A(1) (\u03c6). An interesting feature\ncompared with the kX case discussed above is that the normalization of the potential now\nalso becomes a function of \u03c6. To see this explicitly we write the conformal factor as\nA(\u03c6, X) = B(\u03c6)C(X),\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhich means the effective potential satisfies\nVef f,\u03c6 (\u03c6) = V,\u03c6 + \u03c1\u0302B,\u03c6 C (0)\n\n\u0001\n\n1 \u2212 BC (1) \u03c1\u0302\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\n,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere C i refers to the i-th component in a Taylor-series expansion of C(X) in powers of X i .\nSince at the minimum of the potential Vef f,\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) = 0, we obtain an effective chameleon\nmass for oscillations around \u03c6min of\nm2 =\n\nV,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) \u2212 21 \u03c1\u0302C (0) B,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min )\n.\n1 \u2212 12 k2 B(\u03c6min )C (1) \u03c1\u0302\n\n(5.9)\n\nIf one is concerned that additional singularities are introduced by the \u03c1\u0302\u22121 dependence of A here, notice\nthat a condition such as A(1) \u03c1\u0302 \u223c 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c1\u0302 will also ensure a ghost-free mass-lifting regime.\n6\n\n14\n\n\fViewing the effective potential as a renormalized version of the corresponding standard\n(i.e. non-derivative) chameleon setup with C = 1, the effect of the B(\u03c6min ) term in the\ndenominator can be described as making this renormalization \u03c6-dependent. The top right\nplot in figure 2 shows the effective potential for a separable conformal factor of the form\nA(\u03c6, X) = Exp [k1 \u03c6 + k2 X]. Note that we require a positive k2 , because otherwise the\nconformal factor diverges as \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2192 0, i.e. no stable, static solution is possible. Now the\neffective mass can be written as\n\u0001\u22121\nV,\u03c6\u03c6 (\u03c6min ) + \u03c1\u0302k12 ek1 \u03c6min\n2\n2\nk1 \u03c6min\nm =\n=\nm\n1\n\u2212\nk\ne\n\u03c1\u0302\n.\n(5.10)\n2\nstandard\n1 \u2212 k2 ek1 \u03c6min \u03c1\u0302\nThe solution again separates into the three branches discussed. For positive B(\u03c6) and when\n0 < k2 B \u03c1\u0302 < 1 the effective potential has a well behaved minimum protected by an infinite\npotential barrier at \u03c6crit , where \u03c6crit satisfies k2 B(\u03c6crit )\u03c1\u0302 = 1 for a given \u03c1\u0302. Equation (5.10)\nthen shows that m2 is enhanced by the derivative-dependence of A(\u03c6, X). For values of\n\u03c6 > \u03c6crit there do exist unstable regions of parameter space. However, a particle, which\nstarts at an initial field value \u03c6i for which k2 B(\u03c6i )\u03c1\u0302 < 1, is protected from entering the\nunstable region. Conversely, given a particular conformal factor that fixes k2 , solutions with\npositive B(\u03c6) inside a source with energy density such that \u03c1\u0302 > (k2 B)\u22121 are unstable. Finally,\nfor negative B(\u03c6) a stable, mass-lowering solution is obtained similar to the one discussed\nin the previous section. The top right plot of figure 2 illustrates these three branches and\none can see the generation of an effective minimum and how the mass m2 can be tuned by\nvarying k2 (for a fixed \u03c1\u0302) at the expense of lowering the critical field value \u03c6crit .\n\n5.3\n\nExample III: A purely derivative conformal factor A(X)\n\nSuppose we have a purely derivative conformal factor that does not depend on the field value\nof \u03c6 itself. This is interesting, since it means the theory has a shift symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + c,\npotentially protecting it from a number of quantum corrections7 (assuming this is at most\nsoftly broken by the potential V (\u03c6) - cf. [45], where this point is discussed in an inflationary\nsetting). As such, let us consider a conformal factor of the following form\n\u0001\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (X)g\u03bc\u03bd = 1 + A(1) X + O(X 2 ) g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(5.11)\nwhere A(0) has been appropriately normalized (i.e. there is no fundamental reason why\nit should be unity) and where all Ai are now constants and therefore not functions of \u03c6.\nThe reason to require A(0) 6= 0 is that otherwise any coupling between gravity and matter\nvanishes once \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 = 0, e.g. once \u03c6 has settled into its minimum. The full action can then\nbe written as\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\n\u0001\nM\n4 \u221a\nS= dx g\nR + X \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Sm A2 (X)g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8i .\n(5.12)\n2\n7\n\nThis statement is of course not as strong as for a theory with an additional Galilean shift symmetry\n(cf. [9]) where an effective non-renormalization theorem can be derived [41, 42]. Note, however, that even\nthere analogous concerns enter due to the non shift-symmetric matter coupling \u03c6T\u0303 , cf. discussions in [43, 44].\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 2: Top Left: Plot showing the effective potential Vef f (\u03c6) (solid line) for a separable conformal\nfactor A(\u03c6, X) = B(\u03c6)C(X) = ek1 \u03c6+k2 X (dashed line) and a runaway potential V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u22123 (dotted line)\nin arbitrary units. Top Right: Logarithmic plot showing Vef f (\u03c6) for different choices of k2 (negative, zero\nand positive from bottom to top with \u03c1\u0302 = 1 in arbitrary units). This shows how the amplitude, and hence\nmass, of the chameleon field grows as k2 is enlarged, while the stable region of parameter space is reduced.\nThe dashed line shows how the pole in the denominator of Vef f creates a discontinuity at \u03c6crit and the\neffective potential assumes a runaway form for values of \u03c6>\n\u223c\u03c6crit . In other words, the solution transitions\nbetween the mass-lifting and ghost-like branches at \u03c6crit . Note that the value taken by \u03c6crit is a function\nof \u03c1\u0302 and the effective potential. Bottom Left: Plot showing the effective potential for a conformal factor\nas in equation (5.2) and for different values of the parameter kX and fixed \u03c1\u0302: The solid line shows the nonderivative chameleon with kX = 0, dashed lines show the mass-lifting branch with 0 < kX \u03c1\u0302 < 1, dot-dashed\nlines show the mass lowering branch with kX < 0 and dotted lines lie in the unstable region with kX \u03c1\u0302 > 1.\nBottom Right: Analogous plot varying \u03c1\u0302 for some fixed positive kX (hence no mass-lowering branch is\npresent here). Varying \u03c1\u0302 changes the position of the minimum as well as the normalization of Vef f and\nhence its curvature and mass m2 . \u03c1\u0302 is zero for the solid line and below/above \u03c1\u0302crit for dashed/dotted lines\nrespectively.\n\nNow we have already seen that a conformal factor, which does not depend on the field\nvalue \u03c6 itself, cannot create an effective potential with a minimum, if V (\u03c6) is of the runaway\nform (so it does not have a mass term). But what if dark energy is in fact sourced by a very\nlight, but not massless, cosmological scalar? Then V (\u03c6) does already have a (very small)\nmass term and hence a minimum. Let us focus on a particularly simple toy model and\n16\n\n\fconsider a power-law potential of the form\n1\nV (\u03c6) =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u00132\n,\n\n(5.13)\n\ni.e. a simple mass term for m\u03c6 = \u03c6\u22121\n0 , which allows us to tune the mass of the field by\nchoosing \u03c60 . In order for this field to act as dark energy on large scales, it has to be\n\u221233\nextremely light m\u03c6 = \u03c6\u22121\neV . Now the effective equation of motion for \u03c6 is\n0 .

This outlines how a mass-lifting mechanism caused by a purely X-dependent conformal factor can give rise to a viable chameleontype solution. An otherwise extremely light cosmological scalar field then acquires a large\nmass in dense environments.\nWe emphasize that the point made here is independent of the exact form of the potential.\nGiven any potential for a non-massless field \u03c6, i.e. a potential with a minimum at \u03c6c , the\nmechanism outlined here will raise the field's mass in a density-dependent manner. We can\ntherefore apply this purely derivative mass-lifting mechanism to any potential V (\u03c6) for a\nfield with a small mass m\u03c6 6= 0, which reproduces the desired dark energy behavior on\ncosmological scales.\nHowever, this approach faces a major obstacle. The field's mass has to be enlarged by\nseveral orders of magnitude if a light cosmological scalar \u03c6 is to escape detection on solar\nsystem scales. This means A(1) \u03c1\u0302 \u223c 1 for a large range of densities \u03c1\u0302, so that A(1) has to depend\non \u03c1\u0302 in order to suppress the otherwise strong dependence of m2 on \u03c1\u0302 and in order to prevent\nghost-like instabilities from developing. We refer to section 4 and the previous examples\nin this section for a discussion of the possibility of such a density-dependent conformal\nfactor. Also note that the mass-lowering branch with A(1) < 0, albeit perhaps less interesting\nphenomenologically, does not face this problem just as discussed in the previous examples.\n\n6\n\nRadial solutions, the thin-shell effect and \"friction\nterms\"\n\nIn this section we investigate the static, radial \u03c6-profile in and around a spherically symmetric\nbody with uniform density \u03c1\u0302 - a good approximation for the profile around the sun or earth,\n17\n\n\ffor example.8 Expressing the general equation of motion (4.10) for such a profile one finds\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 2\nd\u03c6\nd \u03c6 2 d\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c1\u0302A\nV,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X )\n+\n,X\u03c6\ndr2\nr dr\ndr\n\u0012\n\u00132\n2\nd \u03c6 d\u03c6\n\u2212 A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302,\n(6.1)\n+ \u03c1\u0302A,XX 2\ndr\ndr\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 and \u03c6 are functions of r. We now modify the approach taken in [4] in that we still\nassume\n\u001a\n\u03c1\u0302c for r \u001d R\n\u03c1\u0302(r) =\n(6.2)\n\u03c1\u0302\u221e for r \u001c R.\nwhere R is the radius of the spherical object, \u03c1\u0302c is its density and \u03c1\u0302\u221e is the density of the\nsurroundings. With an eye on computing the gradient term \u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302(r) in (6.1), we model the\nboundary between source and surroundings by a very sharp, but smooth, transition between\n\u03c1\u0302c and \u03c1\u0302\u221e . The particular template we shall adopt is\n1\n\u03c1\u0302(r) = (\u03c1\u0302c \u2212 \u03c1\u0302\u221e )(1 \u2212 Tanh [s(r \u2212 R)]) + \u03c1\u0302\u221e ,\n(6.3)\n2\ntaking s \u001d 1, so that \u03c1\u0302 effectively remains at its asymptotic values except for a sharp\ntransition around r = R. A unique solution for (6.1) requires specifying two boundary\nconditions. Again following [4], we take these to be d\u03c6(r = 0)/dr = 0, so that the solution is\nnon-singular at the origin, and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6\u221e as r \u2192 \u221e, which ensures that the \u03c6-mediated force\nbetween two test bodies vanishes as r \u2192 \u221e.\nIn what follows we will first recap how this setup gives rise to a thin-shell effect for the\nminimal conformal chameleon (i.e. the standard case). Then we discuss how radial solutions\nand thin-shell behavior are modified by introducing derivative conformal factors, paying\nspecial attention to the effect of \"friction terms\" in (6.1) (i.e. X and \u03a0 dependent terms as\nin J2 and J3 (4.8)).\n\n6.1\n\nThe thin-shell effect for standard chameleons\n\nAny given physical system will come equipped with a specific V (\u03c6), \u03c1\u0302, R etc. This will\nthen allow us to compute the corresponding solution to (6.1), in particular fixing the initial\nfield-value \u03c6i at r = 0. Alternatively one can explore the system's solutions by choosing\nsome \u03c6i and finding the corresponding region in (\u03c1\u0302, R, ...) parameter space [4].9\nNow for the minimal conformal chameleon, as described in section 2, the radial equation\nof motion is simply\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nd \u03c6 2 d\u03c6\nV,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302 =\n+\n.\n(6.4)\ndr2\nr dr\n8\n\nFor a time-dependent chameleon field in the case of a radially pulsating mass, see [46].\nThis amounts to solving (6.1) as a classical mechanics problem with \u03c6 being a position- and r being a\ntime-coordinate. Note that the opposite signs for temporal and spatial dimensions in g\u03bc\u03bd 's signature mean\nthat, for the radial solution we are considering here, the particle whose \"position\" is described by \u03c6 \"moves\"\non the inverted, and hence unstable, potential \u2212Vef f .\n9\n\n18\n\n\fLeft: The radial solution for a standard chameleon with conformal factor A(\u03c6) = ek1 \u03c6 and\ndifferent values for the parameter k1 = 1, 1.05, 1.1, 1.2 from bottom to top. The initial \u03c6i (r = 0) remains\nfixed for all k1 here (note that the position of the extremum \u03c6c also depends on A and hence k1 ). Right:\nPlot showing how a suitably chosen \u03c6i leads to a radial solution that asymptotes to \u03c6\u221e as r \u2192 \u221e. k1 = 1\nhere.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nOutside the source, i.e. at a radius r > R, the solution for \u03c6 then assumes the form [4]\n\u0013\n\u2206R Mc e\u2212m\u221e (r\u2212R)\n\u03c6(r) \u223c\n,\nR\nr\n\u2206R\n\u03c6\u221e \u2212 \u03c6c\nR \u2212 Rroll\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u001c 1,\nR\n\u03a6c\nR\n\u0012\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the source, Mc is its mass, \u03c6\u221e and m\u221e are the field value and mass\nof the field as r \u2192 \u221e, \u03c6c is the local extremum of the \u03c6-potential inside the source10 and \u03a6c\nis the Newtonian potential at the surface of the source. We have also assumed that \u2206R/R,\nthe so-called thin-shell suppression factor, is small. An intuitive picture for this setup is the\nfollowing: The field is released at \"time\" r = 0 from \u03c6i . Inside the source the field remains\nstuck near \u03c6i with its dynamics dominated by the 2/r * d\u03c6/dr friction term. Eventually, at\nr = Rroll , the field \u03c6 starts rolling and hence developing gradient terms. Only contributions\nfrom the region between Rroll and R, i.e. the region where gradient terms develop, are felt\nby the exterior profile. Since \u2206R/R \u001c 1, the chameleon force from a large massive body\non a test mass is therefore thin-shell suppressed. This is essential in explaining why e.g.\nplanetary orbits are not affected by a chameleonic force. In the language set out above the\nthin-shell regime corresponds to \u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6c \u001c \u03c6c .\n>\u03c6c ,\nIn contrast, the radial solution for the unsuppressed \"thick-shell\" regime, where \u03c6i \u223c\nis given by\n\u03c6(r) \u223c\n10\n\nMc e\u2212m\u221e (r\u2212R)\n.\nr\n\n(6.6)\n\nSince we are effectively dealing with motion along \u2212Vef f , \u03c6c is the same as \u03c6min in previous sections.\n\n19\n\n\fHere the field starts significantly displaced from \u03c6c and consequently starts rolling almost\nimmediately. Gradient terms develop inside the source and there is no thin-shell suppression\n(hence the absence of the \u2206R/R factor). It is intuitively clear that the presence of further\nderivative terms in the general solution (4.10) will modify this behavior, since it will affect\ngradient terms in \u03c6. We now move on to explore such \"friction\" terms and their effect on\nthe thin-shell mechanism.11\n\n6.2\n\nRadial solutions for derivative chameleons\n\nFigure 4: Left: Plot of the radial solution for a conformal factor as in (5.2) with kX = 0 (solid line), kX\nincreasingly positive (dashed lines - kX increases as one moves out from the solid line) and kX increasingly\nnegative (dotted lines - kX decreases as one moves out from the solid line). Middle: Plot of the radial\nsolution for a conformal factor as in (6.9). Again the solid line denotes kX = 0. Dashed lines are for\nfixed positive kX and outwardly increasing k2 , while dotted lines are for negative kX , again with outwardly\nincreasing k2 . In order to illustrate the effect of derivative contributions more clearly the solution is shown\nfor an initial displacement \u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6c \u223c O(\u03c6c /10), i.e. an intermediate region between thin- and thick-shell\nscreening. Notice that the most significant effect comes from the \u2202 \u03c1\u0302 term at r = R, which produces a \"kink\"\nin the radial solution (actually smooth due to the density profile (6.3)). Right: Analogous plot with the\nsolid line describing kX = 0. kX is positive above and negative below the solid line. Here dashed lines\nrepresent the solution including the friction term that depends on A,X\u03c6 (cf equation (6.10)), while dotted\nlines ignore this contribution. The additional \"friction term\" therefore drives the solution further away from\nthe non-derivative limit.\n\nDerivative solutions without \"friction terms\": How does the radial solution and\nthin-shell suppression change once we go beyond the simplest chameleon setups? We begin\nby considering a simple conformal factor of the form\nA(\u03c6, X) = ek1 \u03c6 + kx X,\n\n(6.7)\n\ni.e. a sum-separable A(\u03c6, X) = B(\u03c6) + C(X) with purely linear dependence on X. This\nreduces (6.1) to\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nd \u03c6 2 d\u03c6\nV,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X )\n\u2212 A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302.\n(6.8)\n+\ndr2\nr dr\n11\n\nFurther discussions of standard thin-shell screening and spherically symmetric solutions can be found\ne.g. in [3, 4, 47, 48].\n\n20\n\n\fIn contrast with the standard chameleon case there are therefore two new effects. Firstly\nthe (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X ) term, which effectively renormalizes the potential and is responsible for the\nmass-changing mechanism discussed in section 5. And secondly the new gradient term in\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302, which will only be significant very close to r = R. Importantly we have no X- or\n\u03a0-dependent friction terms for a conformal factor of the form considered here.\nWe plot radial solutions for (6.8) in the left panel of figure 4 for different values of kx .\nThe behavior observed can be understood as follows. For positive kX , the (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X ) term\nincreases the curvature of the effective potential (and hence the mass of oscillations around\nthe minimum). This means that the driving term Vef f,\u03c6 is enhanced and will overcome the\n2/r *d\u03c6/dr friction \"earlier\" in the evolution, i.e. it will reduce Rroll . In other words, in order\nto obtain the same thin-shell screened exterior solution one now needs to release the particle\n\u03c6 from even closer to the minimum value \u03c6c , so that \u03c6derivative\n\u001c \u03c6standard\n. The \u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302 term in\ni\ni\nfact further increases this tendency, giving an additional positive \"kick\" to the gradient of \u03c6.\nNote that this second effect is oblivious to the profile inside the source and as such does not\nmodify the thin-shell condition. However, in order to reach the same boundary value \u03c6\u221e as\nr \u2192 \u221e, both new terms require an initial \u03c6i closer to \u03c6c than in the non-derivative case.\nFor negative kX the converse is true. The curvature and associated mass of the effective\npotential is reduced and thin-shell screening is enhanced, i.e. Rroll is pushed closer to R.\nThis broadens the thin-shell screened parameter-space and reaching the boundary value \u03c6\u221e\nas r \u2192 \u221e requires an initial \u03c6i further away from \u03c6c than in the non-derivative case for\nnegative kX . Overall the new derivative dependent effects found here modify the parameterspace for thin-shell screened solutions, with a positive/negative kX weakening/strengthening\nthin-shell screening respectively. As intuitively expected from modifying the curvature of the\neffective potential, the mass-lifting branch is therefore associated with a suppressed thin-shell\nmechanism, whereas the mass-lowering branch enhances thin-shell screening.\nDerivative solutions with \"friction terms\": Here we finally wish to examine the\neffect of \"friction terms\" that depend on derivatives of \u03c6. The toy model we adopt has a\nconformal factor\nA(\u03c6, X) = ek1 \u03c6 + kX ek2 \u03c6 X + O(X 2 ),\n(6.9)\nwhere we will ignore the higher order corrections O(X 2 ). This means the radial solution (6.1)\nsimplifies as \u03a0-dependent contributions drop out (such contributions only come in for a\nconformal order with non-linear dependence on X). The equation of motion consequently\nbecomes\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00132\nd \u03c6 2 d\u03c6\nd\u03c6\nV,\u03c6 + A,\u03c6 \u03c1\u0302 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X )\n+\n\u2212 \u03c1\u0302A,X\u03c6\n\u2212 A,X \u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302.\n(6.10)\n2\ndr\nr dr\ndr\nIn the middle and right panel of figure 4 we plot solutions for constant k1 , but varying k2 and\nkX , essentially tuning the contribution of the 2\u03c1\u0302A,X\u03c6 X term. One can see that a large k2 in\ncombination with the presence of the \u2202\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302 term magnifies the \"kick\" at r \u223c R. Perhaps more\ninterestingly, for positive kX the direct coupling of \u03c6 to its derivative in the conformal factor\nagain counteracts the thin-shell effect, by driving the field away from near its minimum \u03c6c .\n21\n\n\fAs before this results in a reduced Rroll . Also as before the converse is true for negative kX .\nThe inclusion of the 2\u03c1\u0302A,X\u03c6 X term therefore strengthens the tendencies observed above:\nThe mass-lifting branch becomes yet more fine-tuned in order to obtain a thin-shell screened\nsolution, while for the mass-lowering branch the parameter-space corresponding to thin-shell\nscreening is broadened.\nThis concludes our brief survey of how radial solutions around a massive source are\nmodified by the introduction of derivative terms into the conformal factor. As a generic\nfeature, we observe that a positive kX , linear dependence on X, which leads to a mass-lifting\nmechanism, simultaneously tightens thin-shell screening constraints, requiring a value of \u03c6i\ncloser to \u03c6c in order to maintain a nearly constant field value inside the source. The converse\nis true for negative kX .\n\n7\n\nDisformal chameleons: A no-go theorem\n\nUntil here we have only been considering conformal couplings to matter. Here we wish\nto investigate whether switching on the disformal B 2 term (3.6) can result in interesting\nmodifications to the chameleon mechanism (for other disformal dark energy models we refer\nto [49, 50]). As such, matter now couples to the full disformal matter metric\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd + B 2 (\u03c6, X)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6.\nNote that such a metric always has a well-defined inverse [32] given by\n\u0001\ng\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = A\u22122 (\u03c6, X) g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 B 2 (\u03c6, X)C \u22121 (\u03c6, X)\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6 ,\n\n(7.1)\n\n(7.2)\n\nsubject to the condition that A2 (\u03c6, X) 6= 0 6= C(\u03c6, X), where C = A2 (\u03c6, X) + B 2 (\u03c6, X)X.\nWe then have\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\n\u0001\nM\n1\n4 \u221a\nS= dx g\nR \u2212 X \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Sm A2 (\u03c6, X)g\u03bc\u03bd + B 2 (\u03c6, X)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6, \u03a8i . (7.3)\n2\n2\nJust as in the conformal case we consider a non-relativistic, pressureless source. In addition\nwe here focus on static solutions for which \u22020 \u03c6 = 0 (requiring spherical symmetry could\nreduce this further to \u03c6 = \u03c6(r)). As such our assumption list now is\n\u2022 The stress-energy tensor describes a pressureless, non-relativistic fluid (T\u030300 = \u2212\u03c1\u0303) with\nall other stress-energy tensor components vanishing.\n\u2022 \u03c6's dynamics are described by a static solution (\u22020 \u03c6 = 0).\n \u0303 \u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0\nAs before we may also assume a static, uniform source in the matter frame (\u2207\ninside the source), but this won't be necessary for the argument here. Instead we are solely\ninterested in whether a chameleon mechanism can arise inside a source as a consequence of\ndisformal contributions here at all.\n22\n\n\fThe equation of motion (3.7) then immediately gives rise to a no-go theorem. This\nis because all disformal (B 2 -dependent) terms in fact involve a contraction of one of the\nfollowing forms\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(7.4)\n\nAs such all disformal contributions vanish for a static solution around a non-relativistic,\npressureless source, since the only non-zero component of the stress energy tensor is T\u0303 00 ,\nwhich vanishes when contracted with \u22020 \u03c6 for a static solution. Chameleonic effects from\nthe disformal coupling are therefore suppressed when considering e.g. solutions around the\nearth. We do expect disformal effects to play an important role when computing relativistic\nor non-static corrections to this solution, however. Nevertheless, this shows that, with the\nmild assumptions implemented above, the dominant contribution to the chameleon profile\nnecessarily has to come from a conformally coupled matter metric. Disformal effects here\nonly come in at next order in relativistic corrections and for non-static profiles. Note that\nwe have focused on chameleonic behavior here. As comparison with the discussion of J5 and\nJ6 (4.6) in section 4 shows, Vainshtein-like screening can arise as a consequence of disformal\ncouplings.12\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nThe main results of this paper can be summarized as follows.\n\u2022 A derivative chameleon model described by (4.2), where all matter is universally and\nminimally coupled to a metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6, X), generically comes with a new massaltering mechanism. This separates into three branches depending on the local energy\ndensity \u03c1\u0302 and the conformal factor A: A mass-lifting (\"screening\") branch, where\nderivative effects lead to an additional enhancement of the effective chameleon mass\ncompared with the non-derivative A2 (\u03c6, X \u2192 0) limit. For high energy-densities above\nsome \u03c1\u0302crit this transitions into a ghost-like branch in which the effective potential\nbecomes unstable. Thirdly there is a stable mass-lowering branch.\n\u2022 This suggests that derivative chameleon models which are not plagued by ghost-like\ninstabilities typically lower the effective chameleon mass. Implementing a mass-lifting\nmechanism while avoiding ghost-like instabilities for a range of different densities \u03c1\u0302\nrequires some additional \"engineering\", e.g. introducing either an appropriate energy\ndensity cutoff or a density-dependent conformal factor.\n12\n\nOnce the metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd is promoted to a building block for further gravitational parts of the action as in [33]\n\u221a\n- e.g. a cosmological-constant-like term g\u0303\u039b, an extrinsic curvature K\u0303\u03bc\u03bd and a Ricci scalar R\u0303 for g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd - then\na full galileon/Horndeski type solution can be obtained, making the Vainshtein screening in question more\nrobust.\n\n23\n\n\f\u2022 A very light, but massive, cosmological scalar can in principle be chameleon-screened\nby a purely derivative-dependent conformal factor A2 (X) in the mass-lifting branch,\nwhich offers added protection from quantum corrections over A2 (\u03c6) due to the presence\nof the shift symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + c.\n\u2022 The position of the minimum \u03c6min of an effective chameleon potential Vef f cannot be\naffected by derivative dependent terms (X-dependent as well as for higher order terms).\nIf we start with a runaway potential, e.g. V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u2212n for some positive n, this means a\n\u03c6-dependent conformal factor is necessary in order to produce chameleon screening. In\nother words, in this particular setup A2 (\u03c6, X) can yield chameleon screening, whereas\nA2 (X) cannot.\n\u2022 Radial solutions and the thin-shell mechanism are modified in derivative chameleon\nmodels. The region of parameter-space exhibiting thin-shell screening is reduced in\nthe mass-lifting branch and enhanced in the mass-lowering branch of solutions.\n\u2022 Disformal contributions to the matter metric cannot source chameleon phenomenology\nfor a static solution around a non-relativistic, pressureless source (they can source\nVainshtein-screened solutions though).\nTo conclude, chameleon models provide a well-established framework for reconciling the\npresence of a light cosmological scalar that drives cosmic acceleration with small scale fifth\nforce constraints. Here we have shown how chameleon-type setups can be generalized to\nderivative-dependent conformal couplings, suggesting that this naturally generates a further\nmass-changing mechanism. The mass-lifting branch offers the possibility to alleviate the\nfine-tuning involved in making a chameleon fit fifth force constraints and also comes with\nthe exciting promise of making chameleon models more robust from a quantum perspective\nby endowing them with a shift symmetry. However, this branch also faces a ghost-problem\nwhich may be answered by introducing a \u03c1\u0302-dependent conformal factor or a \u03c1\u0302-dependent\ncutoff for the theory. For the mass-lowering branch no such problems exist, suggesting that\na mass-suppressing mechanism is in fact a typical feature of derivative chameleon models.\nAs such we hope that this work contributes to the enterprise of providing a wider survey of\nthe ways in which chameleon-phenomenology might be implemented, realizing what types of\nchallenges it has to face, and therefore putting such models on a firmer footing by showing\nwhat requirements stable chameleon models have to meet.\n\nAcknowledgements: I would like to thank Anupam Mazumdar for comments on\nan earlier draft and correspondence.

We\nstart with a metric relation\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6, X) g\u03bc\u03bd .\n(A.1)\nThe covariant derivatives for the two metrics are related by\n \u0303 \u03b1 \u03c9\u03b2 = \u2207\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u03b3 \u03c9\u03b3 .\n\u2207\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(A.2)\n\nFor the Einstein frame covariant derivative \u2207\u03b1 acting on the matter frame stress-energy\ntensor, one therefore finds\n \u0303 \u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03bc T\u0303 \u03b2\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03bd T\u0303 \u03bc\u03b2 .\n\u2207\u03b1 T\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = \u2207\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\n(A.3)\n\nIn calculating the connection \u0393\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1 explicitly, the following relations will be useful\n\u2207\u03b1 A = A,\u03c6 \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6 + A,X \u2202\u03b1 X,\n= A,\u03c6 \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6 \u2212 A,X \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6.\n\u2207\u03b1 A,X = A,X\u03c6 \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6 + A,XX \u2202\u03b1 X,\n= A,X\u03c6 \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6 \u2212 A,XX \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6.\n\n(A.4)\n\nAs such we can work out the connection, arriving at\n1 \u03b3\u03b4\ng\u0303 (\u2207\u03b1 g\u0303\u03b2\u03b4 + \u2207\u03b2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u2207\u03b4 g\u0303\u03b2\u03b1 )\n2 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b3\n\u22121\n\u03b3\u03b4\n= A\n2\u03b4(\u03b2 \u2207 \u03b1) A \u2212 g\u03b1\u03b2 g \u2207\u03b4 A\n\n\u0393\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n= 2A,\u03c6 A\u22121 \u03b4(\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b1) \u03c6 \u2212 2A,X A\u22121 \u03b4(\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b1) \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\n\n\u2212 g\u03b1\u03b2 g \u03b3\u03b4 \u2202\u03b4 \u03c6A\u22121 A,\u03c6 + g\u03b1\u03b2 g \u03b3\u03b4 \u2202\u03b4 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6A\u22121 A,X .\n\n(A.5)\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nT.
