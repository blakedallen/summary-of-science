Introduction\nIn [37, 38], S. Wang constructed a new family of compact quantum groups\n- the so-called free unitary and free orthogonal quantum groups - by considering certain highly noncommutative analogues of the C\u2217 -bialgebras of\ncontinuous functions on the classical unitary and orthogonal groups UN and\nON . More precisely, for any N \u2265 2, the free unitary quantum group (of\n+\n:= (Au (N ), \u2206), where Au (N ) is the universal\ndimension N ) is the pair UN\n\u2217\n2\nC -algebra defined by N generators {uij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N }, subject to the\nrelations which make the matrices\n(1.1)\n\nU := [uij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N\n\nand U := [u\u2217ij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N\n\nunitary, and \u2206 : Au (N ) \u2192 Au (N ) \u2297min Au (N ) is the coproduct determined\nby\n(1.2)\n\n\u2206(uij ) =\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\nuik \u2297 ukj\n\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N ).\n\n+\n:= (Ao (N ), \u2206),\nSimilarly, the free orthogonal quantum group is the pair ON\n\u2217\n2\nwhere Ao (N ) is the universal C -algebra defined by N self-adjoint gener\u2217 : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N }, subject to the relations which make the\nators {vij = vij\nmatrix\n\n(1.3)\n\nV := [vij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N\n\nDate: May 15, 2018.\nKey words and phrases.

The series {UN\nand UN\nwhen these groups are replaced by ON\nalso provides canonical examples of \"quantum Haar unitary\" random matrices, which can be used to prove asymptotic operator valued freeness results a phenomenon which does not occur when using classical Haar unitary random matrices [16]. From the perspective of operator algebras, the reduced\nC\u2217 -algebras and von Neumann algebras arising from the GNS representa+\n+\nform an interesting class of operator\nand UN\ntions of the Haar traces on ON\nalgebras, about which much is still not known.\n+\n+\n, let C(G) denote the reduced C\u2217 -algebra of G, and let\nor UN\nFor G = ON\n\u221e\n\u2032\u2032\nL (G) = C(G) denote the reduced von Neumann algebra of G.

Given the above structural properties,\n+\n+\n, N \u2265 3)\nor UN\nit is natural to ask whether the algebras L\u221e (G) (G = ON\nalso give rise to free group factors? At this time, a direct answer to this\nquestion seems to be out of reach. Nevertheless, we can try and shed light\non this question by asking what other structural properties of C(G) and\nL\u221e (G) are shared by the reduced free group algebras C\u03bb\u2217 (Fk ) and L(Fk )\n(k \u2265 2)?\nIn this paper, we consider this second question, and in particular look\nat what sorts of approximation properties these operator algebras have.\n+\n+\n) have the\n) and L\u221e (UN\nWe prove that the von Neumann algebras L\u221e (ON\nHaagerup approximation property for all N \u2265 2, which answers questions\nposed by Vaes [33] and Vergnioux [36, Introduction]. Recall that a finite\nvon Neumann algebra (M, \u03c4 ) (with faithful normal trace \u03c4 : M \u2192 C) has\nthe Haagerup approximation property (HAP) if there exists a net {\u03a6\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b\nof normal, unital, completely positive, \u03c4 -preserving maps on M such that:\n\n\fAPPROXIMATION PROPERTIES FOR FREE QUANTUM GROUPS\n\n3\n\n(1) For each \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, the unique L2 -extension \u03a6\u0302\u03bb : L2 (M ) \u2192 L2 (M ) is a\ncompact operator, and\n(2) For each x \u2208 M , lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b k\u03a6\u0302\u03bb (x\u0302) \u2212 x\u0302kL2 (M ) = 0, where x 7\u2192 x\u0302 is the\nusual embedding M \u0592\u2192 L2 (M ).\nConditions (1) and (2) of course imply that the identity map idM \u2192M =\nlim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u03a6\u03bb in the point \u03c3-weak topology of B(M ). Note that the HAP is a\nvery important structural property for a finite von Neumann algebra, since\nit is an isomorphism invariant (see Remark 3.1), and it is also a useful tool\nfor proving other approximation properties, such as the weak\u2217 -(completely)\nbounded approximation property (see [29, 30]).\nIn [21], Haagerup established the positive definiteness of the exponentiated length functions {g 7\u2192 e\u2212|g|t }t\u22650 on the free groups Fk (k \u2265 2), which\nyields the HAP for the free group factors L(Fk ). Combining this result with\nthe Haagerup inequality for the free groups [21, Lemma 1.4], Haagerup also\nshowed that the reduced C\u2217 -algebras C\u03bb\u2217 (Fk ) have the metric approximation\nproperty (despite being non-nuclear). Combining our proof of the HAP for\n+\n+\n) with a version of the Haagerup inequality for these\n) and L\u221e (UN\nL\u221e (ON\nquantum groups proved by Vergnioux [35], we are also able to show that\n+\n+\n) have the metric approximation\n) and C(UN\nthe reduced C\u2217 -algebras C(ON\nproperty. This answers a question posed by Vergnioux in [35, Introduction]. We also show that C(U2+ ) has the (stronger) completely contractive\napproximation property (see Remark 5.11).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains a\nbrief review of the basic results on C\u2217 -algebraic compact quantum groups\nthat we will need. In Section 3, we restate the definition of the Haagerup\napproximation property in the context of compact quantum groups of Kac\ntype, and prove some general results about normal completely positive\nmaps on their reduced von Neumann algebras. In Section 4, we prove that\n+\n+\n) using\n) always has the HAP, and deduce the same result for L\u221e (UN\nL\u221e (ON\n+\n\u221e\na free product representation of L (UN ) due to Banica [3].

Preliminaries and Notation\nIn this section we review the basic theory of compact quantum groups, as\ndeveloped by Woronowicz in [40] (see also the excellent book [32]). For the\nremainder of this paper, we will use the symbol \u2297 when writing the minimal\ntensor product of a pair of C\u2217 -algebras. Similarly, \u2297 will be used to denote\nthe von Neumann tensor product, and \u2297alg will denote the purely algebraic\ntensor product of two algebras. A basic familiarity with the theory of completely bounded maps will be assumed. In particular, B(X) (resp. CB(X))\nwill always denote the algebra of bounded (resp. completely bounded) operators on a Banach (resp. operator) space X. Our reference for this will\nbe [27, 28].\nA compact quantum group (CQG) is a pair G = (A, \u2206) where\n\u2022 A is a unital C\u2217 -algebra,\n\u2022 \u2206 : A \u2192 A \u2297 A is a unital \u2217-homomorphism satisfying the coassociativity relation\n(2.1)\n\n(idA \u2297 \u2206) \u25e6 \u2206 = (\u2206 \u2297 idA ) \u25e6 \u2206,\nand\n\u2022 G satisfies the cancellation property. That is, the sets\n\u2206(A)(1A \u2297 A), and \u2206(A)(A \u2297 1A ),\n\nare linearly dense in A \u2297 A.\nFrom these three axioms, it follows that any CQG G = (A, \u2206) admits\na unique state h : A \u2192 C, called the Haar state, which satisfies the biinvariance condition\n(2.2)\n\n(h \u2297 idA )\u2206(x) = (idA \u2297 h)\u2206(x) = h(x)1A\n\n(x \u2208 A).\n\nWe denote by L2 (G) the usual GNS Hilbert space obtained from equipping\nA with the sesquilinear form (x, y) 7\u2192 h(y \u2217 x), and denote by \u03c0h : A \u2192\nB(L2 (G)) the GNS representation. We also put C(G) = \u03c0h (A) \u2286 B(L2 (G)),\nand L\u221e (G) = C(G)\u2032\u2032 \u2286 B(L2 (G)). C(G) is called the reduced C\u2217 -algebra\nof G, and L\u221e (G) is called the reduced von Neumann algebra of G. Since\nh = (h \u2297 h) \u25e6 \u2206, it follows that the coproduct \u2206 determines a coproduct \u2206r :\nC(G) \u2192 C(G) \u2297 C(G) satisfying \u2206r \u25e6 \u03c0h = (\u03c0h \u2297 \u03c0h ) \u25e6 \u2206. Furthermore, \u2206r\nextends to a normal \u2217-homomorphism \u2206r : L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G). The\nCQG Gr = (C(G), \u2206r ) is called the reduced version of G, and (L\u221e (G), \u2206r )\nis a von Neumann algebraic CQG, in the sense of [25]. The Haar state\nhr : C(G) \u2192 C is given by hr (\u03c0h (x)) = h(x) for each x \u2208 A, and extends to\na faithful normal state on L\u221e (G). From now on we will drop the subscript\n\n\fAPPROXIMATION PROPERTIES FOR FREE QUANTUM GROUPS\n\n5\n\nr from hr , and just write h for the Haar state in all possible situations. No\nconfusion should arise from this.\nFor any CQG G = (A, \u2206), the Banach space A\u2217 of continuous linear\nfunctionals on A comes equipped with the associative convolution product\n(\u03c6, \u03c8) 7\u2192 \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 = (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8) \u25e6 \u2206.\n\nWith this product, A\u2217 is a (completely contractive) Banach algebra. The\npredual L1 (G) := L\u221e (G)\u2217 of the reduced von Neumann algebra of G can\nbe completely isometrically identified with a closed subspace of A\u2217 via the\ndual pairing\n(2.3)\n\nhx, \u03c9i = h\u03c9, \u03c0h (x)i\n\n(x \u2208 A, \u03c9 \u2208 L1 (G)).\n\nWith this identification, L1 (G) is a closed two-sided ideal in A\u2217 (see [17],\n[24, Page 913-914]).\nDefinition 2.1. An (n-dimensional) corepresentation of a CQG G = (A, \u2206)\nis a matrix U = [uij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u2208 Mn (A) = Mn (C) \u2297 A with the property that\n\u2206(uij ) =\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\nuik \u2297 ukj\n\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n).\n\nWe say that U is a unitary corepresentation if in addition U is a unitary\nelement of Mn (A).\nIf U = [uij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264n , is a corepresentation, the matrix U = [u\u2217ij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264n is\nalso a corepresentation, called the conjugate of U . We note that U may not\nbe a unitary corepresentation, even if U is unitary.\nIf U \u2208 Mn (C) \u2297 A and V \u2208 Mm (C) \u2297 A are two corepresentations of G,\nwe define the vector space\nHom(U, V ) = {T \u2208 B(Cn , Cm ) : (T \u2297 1A )U = V (T \u2297 1A )}.\n\nAn element T \u2208 Hom(U, V ) is called an intertwiner from U to V . The corepresentation U is called irreducible if Hom(U, U ) = Cid, and U is irreducible\nif and only if U is. U and V are called (unitarily) equivalent corepresentations if there exists an invertible (unitary) operator T \u2208 Hom(U, V ), and we\nwrite U \u223c\n=V.\nThe matrix\nU \u22a0 V := [uij vkl ] 1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u2208 Mn (C) \u2297 Mm (C) \u2297 A,\n1\u2264k,l\u2264m\n\nis again a corepresentation of G, called the tensor product of U and V .\nOne can of course define the notion of an infinite dimensional (unitary)\ncorepresentation of G (see [40, Section 2]), however we will not need this\ngenerality here, mainly due to the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.2. ([40]) Every irreducible corepresentation of a CQG is finite\ndimensional and equivalent to a unitary one. Furthermore, every unitary\ncorepresentation is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of irreducibles.\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL BRANNAN\n\nLet {U \u03b1 = [u\u03b1ij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264d\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A} be a maximal family of finite-dimensional\nirreducible unitary corepresentations of G = (A, \u2206), with \u03b10 being the index\ncorresponding to the trivial corepresentation 1A \u2208 A, and U \u03b1 denoting the\nrepresentative of the class of U \u03b1 . Let A denote the subspace of A spanned\nby the matrix elements {u\u03b1ij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A}. Then A is a Hopf\n\u2217-algebra with faithful Haar state given by h|A , A is norm dense in A, and\nthe set {u\u03b1ij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A} is a linear basis for A. The coproduct\n\u2206A : A \u2192 A \u2297alg A is just the restriction \u2206|A , the coinverse \u03ba : A \u2192 A is\nthe antihomomorphism given by\n\u03ba(u\u03b1ij ) = (u\u03b1ji )\u2217\n\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A),\n\nand the counit \u01eb : A \u2192 C is the \u2217-character given by\n\u01eb(u\u03b1ij ) = \u03b4ij\n\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A).\n\nThe Hopf \u2217-algebra A is unique in the sense that if B \u2286 A is any other dense\nHopf \u2217-subalgebra, then B = A (see [8, Theorem 5.1]).\nIn general, the counit \u01eb : A \u2192 C and the coinverse \u03ba : A \u2192 A defined\nabove cannot be extended to bounded linear maps on A. A CQG G = (A, \u2206)\nis called co-amenable if the map \u03c0h (x) 7\u2192 \u01eb(x) (x \u2208 A) extends to a character\nof C(G). In this paper we will mainly deal with CQGs of Kac type, which\nare precisely those for which the coinverse \u03ba can be extended to a bounded\nmap on A.\nDefinition 2.3. A CQG G = (A, \u2206) is said to be of Kac type if any one of\nthe following equivalent conditions is satisfied.\n(1) \u03ba : A \u2192 A has a continuous extension to a \u2217-antihomomorphism\n\u03ba : A \u2192 A.\n(2) \u03ba2 = idA .\n(3) The Haar state h : A \u2192 C is a trace.\nSee [1] for proofs of the above equivalences. From the universality of the\nC\u2217 -algebras of Ao (N ) and Au (N ) defined in Section 1, it is not difficult to\n+\nsee that condition (1) of Definition 2.3 is satisfied for these algebras. So ON\n+\n+\nand UN are of Kac type. Also, ON is not co-amenable for all N \u2265 3, and\n+\nis not co-amenable for all N \u2265 2 [3].\nUN\nWhen G = (A, \u2206) is of Kac type and U \u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2208 A) is an irreducible unitary\ncorepresentation (using the above notation), it is readily checked that U \u03b1 is\nalso unitary. We can therefore assume from now on that our representatives\n{U \u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A} have been chosen so that U \u03b1 = U \u03b1 . In this case, we have\n(2.4)\n\n\u03ba(u\u03b1ij ) = (u\u03b1ji )\u2217 = u\u03b1ji\n\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A).\n\u221a\nFurthermore, the family of matrix elements { d\u03b1 u\u03b1ij : \u03b1 \u2208 A, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264\nd\u03b1 } \u2282 A always forms an orthonormal basis for L2 (G) in the Kac algebraic\nsetting.\nFinally, when G = (A, \u2206) is of Kac type, the map \u03bar : C(G) \u2192 C(G) defined by \u03bar (\u03c0h (x)) = \u03c0h (\u03ba(x)) (x \u2208 A), defines the coinverse for the reduced\n\n\fAPPROXIMATION PROPERTIES FOR FREE QUANTUM GROUPS\n\n7\n\nquantum group Gr . Furthermore, \u03bar extends to a normal \u2217-antiautomorphism\n\u03bar : L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (G).\n3. The Haagerup Approximation Property for Compact\nQuantum Groups of Kac Type\nIn this section, we discuss the Haagerup approximation property in the\ncontext of CQGs G = (A, \u2206) of Kac type, and prove some general results\non constructing normal completely positive maps on L\u221e (G) from states on\nA.\nWe will say that a CQG G = (A, \u2206) of Kac type has the Haagerup\napproximation property (HAP) if the finite von Neumann algebra (L\u221e (G), h)\nhas the HAP, as defined in Section 1.\nRemark 3.1. At this point, it is worthwhile to mention that the HAP for a\nfinite von Neumann algebra (M, \u03c4 ) does not actually depend on the particular choice of trace \u03c4 . I.e., if \u03c4 \u2032 : M \u2192 C is another faithful, normal, finite\ntrace, then (M, \u03c4 \u2032 ) also has the HAP. Furthermore, in the definition of the\nHAP, the requirement that the maps \u03a6\u03bb : M \u2192 M be \u03c4 -preserving can be\nrelaxed to \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03a6\u03bb \u2264 \u03c4 , and this yields the same class of von Neumann algebras [22]. From the trace-independence of the HAP, it is easily deduced that\nthe HAP is an invariant for the isomorphism class of a finite von Neumann\nalgebra.\nNotation 3.2. Let A be a C\u2217 -algebra and let T : A \u2192 A be a linear map.\nWe will say that T is UCP when T is unital and completely positive. If A is\na von Neumann algebra, we will say that T is NUCP if T is normal, unital,\nand completely positive.\nIn order to establish that a given CQG G = (A, \u2206) of Kac type has the\nHAP, we need to construct a net of NUCP, h-preserving maps on L\u221e (G)\nwhich satisfies certain properties. In the classical case (when G corresponds\neither to a classical compact group G or the dual of a discrete group \u0393),\na convenient place to look for such maps is within the set of convolution\noperators induced by states on the C\u2217 -algebra A. In the general situation,\nthe same is true: states on A yield concrete examples of NUCP maps on\nL\u221e (G). We will now briefly outline this well known procedure.\nDefinition 3.3. Let G = (A, \u2206) be a CQG and \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 a state. The UCP\nh-preserving map C\u03c6 : A \u2192 A given by\nC\u03c6 x = (\u03c6 \u2297 idA )\u2206(x)\n\n(x \u2208 A),\n\nis called the (left) convolution operator associated to \u03c6.\nLet \u03c0h : A \u2192 C(G) denote the GNS representation of the Haar state\nh : A \u2192 C. The following lemma shows that the convolution operator C\u03c6\nfactors through the quotient C(G) \u223c\n= A/ ker \u03c0h , and furthermore extends\nto a NUCP map on L\u221e (G). This result is already known, and can be\nnicely stated (in a more general context) in terms of completely bounded\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL BRANNAN\n\nmultipliers of locally compact quantum groups (see [17, Proposition 8.3] and\n[18, Section 6]). In order to avoid dealing with Pontryagin duality and to\nkeep this paper self-contained, we provide a proof of the following lemma.\nLemma 3.4. Let G = (A, \u2206) be a CQG, and let \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 be a state. Then\nthere exists a unique UCP h-preserving map S\u03c6 : C(G) \u2192 C(G) defined by\nS\u03c6 (\u03c0h (x)) = \u03c0h (C\u03c6 x)\n\n(x \u2208 A),\n\nwhere C\u03c6 is the convolution operator given in Definition 3.3. Furthermore,\nS\u03c6 extends uniquely to a NUCP h-preserving map\nS\u03c6 : L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (G).\nProof. We claim that C\u03c6 (ker \u03c0h ) \u2286 ker \u03c0h . To see this, fix x \u2208 ker \u03c0h . Since\nh is a KMS-state [32, Example 8.1.22], it follows that ker \u03c0h = {x \u2208 A :\nh(x\u2217 x) = 0}. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for completely positive\nmaps ([27, Proposition 3.3]), we have\n(C\u03c6 x)\u2217 (C\u03c6 x) \u2264 C\u03c6 (x\u2217 x).\nApplying h to this inequality and using the fact that C\u03c6 is h-preserving, we\nget\nh((C\u03c6 x)\u2217 (C\u03c6 x)) \u2264 h(C\u03c6 (x\u2217 x)) = h(x\u2217 x) = 0.\n\nSo C\u03c6 x \u2208 ker \u03c0h , proving the claim.\nSince C\u03c6 (ker \u03c0h ) \u2286 ker \u03c0h , we may define a linear map\nS\u03c6 : C(G) \u2192 C(G),\nby setting\nS\u03c6 (\u03c0h (x)) = \u03c0h (C\u03c6 x).\n\nThe fact that S\u03c6 is UCP and h-preserving follows from this formula and the\nfact that C\u03c6 has these properties.\nWe now prove that S\u03c6 extends to a normal map on L\u221e (G). Since L1 (G) \u2286\n\u2217\nA is an ideal, we can consider the map S\u03c6\u2217 \u2208 CB(L1 (G)) given by\nS\u03c6\u2217 (\u03c9) = \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c9\n\n(\u03c9 \u2208 L1 (G)).\n\nThen the adjoint (S\u03c6\u2217 )\u2217 \u2208 CB(L\u221e (G)) is normal, and (S\u03c6\u2217 )\u2217 |C(G) = S\u03c6 .\nIndeed, taking x \u2208 A, \u03c9 \u2208 L1 (G), and using the identification (2.3), we have\nh\u03c9, S\u03c6 \u03c0h (x)i = h\u03c9, \u03c0h ((\u03c6 \u2297 idA )\u2206(x))i = h(\u03c6 \u2297 idA )\u2206(x), \u03c9i\n= (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c9)\u2206(x) = hx, \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c9i = hS\u03c6\u2217 \u03c9, \u03c0h (x)i\n= h\u03c9, (S\u03c6\u2217 )\u2217 \u03c0h (x)i.\nTherefore (S\u03c6\u2217 )\u2217 |C(G) = S\u03c6 . Since C(G) is \u03c3-weakly dense in L\u221e (G), we\nfind that (S\u03c6\u2217 )\u2217 is the unique normal extension of S\u03c6 . The fact that it is\nUCP and h-preserving follows from these properties for S\u03c6 .\n\u0003\n\n\fAPPROXIMATION PROPERTIES FOR FREE QUANTUM GROUPS\n\n9\n\nRemark 3.5. In order to keep our notation simple, we will identify the Hopf\n\u2217-algebra A \u2286 A associated to a CQG G = (A, \u2206) with its image \u03c0h (A) \u2282\nC(G) under the GNS representation \u03c0h : A \u2192 C(G). This is possible\nbecause the Haar state h|A is always faithful (and therefore \u03c0h |A is injective).\nWith this identification, the NUCP map S\u03c6 \u2208 CB(L\u221e (G)) considered in\nLemma 3.4 is given on the basis {u\u03b1ij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A} \u2282 A by the\nformula\nd\u03b1\nX\nS\u03c6 (u\u03b1ij ) = (\u03c6 \u2297 idA )\u2206(u\u03b1ij ) =\n(3.1)\n\u03c6(u\u03b1ik )u\u03b1kj .\nk=1\n\nL\u221e (G)\n\nWe will also identify C(G) and\nwith their dense images in L2 (G),\nvia the GNS map x 7\u2192 x\u0302. Consequently, we have the natural inclusions\nk*k\nA \u2286 C(G) \u2286 L\u221e (G) \u2286 L2 (G), and A = A A .\nEquation (3.1) gives a useful description of the NUCP map S\u03c6 : L\u221e (G) \u2192\nin terms of the action of the state \u03c6 on A. Unfortunately, for a general CQG G = (A, \u2206), it is a difficult task to explicitly construct (nontrivial)\nstates \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 . On the positive side, when G is of Kac type, S\u03c6 can be \"averaged\" using the Haar trace to get a new NUCP map T\u03c6 , which now only\ndepends on the restriction of \u03c6 to the subalgebra of A generated by the\nirreducible characters of G. In order to introduce this averaging result, we\nfirst need some notation.\nL\u221e (G)\n\nNotation 3.6.

The basic idea is\nto obtain T\u03c8 by averaging (with respect to the Haar trace) the NUCP map\nS\u03c6 \u2208 CB(L\u221e(G)), where \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 is any Hahn-Banach extension of \u03c8. We\nwill first need a few preparatory results.\nLemma 3.8. Let G be a CQG of Kac type and let S \u2208 CB(L\u221e (G)) be\nunital, normal and h-preserving. Then the map\n\u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar : L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (G)\n\nis also unital, normal and h-preserving, with k\u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar kcb = kSkcb . Furthermore, we have S(C(G)) \u2286 C(G) if and only if (\u03bar \u25e6S \u25e6\u03bar )C(G) \u2286 C(G).\nProof. This is actually a general result for Kac algebras, proved in [23,\nProposition 2.4] for example. We include a proof for the reader's convenience.\nFirst of all, S and \u03bar are unital, normal, h-preserving, and \u03bar (C(G)) =\nC(G), it follows that \u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar is also unital, normal and h-preserving.\nFurthermore, S(C(G)) \u2286 C(G) if and only if (\u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar )C(G) \u2286 C(G).\nSince \u03bar is a \u2217-antiautomorphism, the map\nL\u221e (G) \u220b x 7\u2192 R(x) = \u03bar (x)\u2217 ,\n\ndefines a conjugate-linear \u2217-automorphism of L\u221e (G), and in particular is a\ncomplete isometry. This means that for any matrix [xij ] \u2208 Mn (L\u221e (G)),\nk[xij ]k = k[xij ]\u2217 k = k[x\u2217ji ]k = k[\u03bar (\u03bar (x\u2217ji ))]k = k[\u03bar (\u03bar (xji ))\u2217 ]k\n\n= k(idMn (C) \u2297 R)[\u03bar (xji )]k = k[\u03bar (xji )]k.\n\nUsing the above equality of matrix norms, we have for any matrix [yij ] \u2208\nMn (L\u221e (G)),\nk(\u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar )(n) [yij ]k = k[\u03bar (S\u03bar (yij ))]k = k[S(\u03bar (yji ))]k\n\u2264 kSkcb k[\u03bar (yji )]k = kSkcb k[yij ]k.\n\nSince n \u2208 N was arbitrary, k\u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar kcb \u2264 kSkcb . The reverse inequality\nfollows from this one, since we may write S = \u03bar \u25e6 (\u03bar \u25e6 S \u25e6 \u03bar ) \u25e6 \u03bar .\n\u0003\nLet G be a CQG of Kac type. Since (L\u221e (G), h) is a finite von Neumann\nalgebra and\n\u2206r : L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G)\n\n\fAPPROXIMATION PROPERTIES FOR FREE QUANTUM GROUPS\n\n11\n\nis an injective normal \u2217-homomorphism, it follows that \u2206r (L\u221e (G)) is a von\nNeumann subalgebra of L\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G). Therefore there exists a unique,\nnormal, h \u2297 h-preserving conditional expectation\nE : L\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G) \u2192 \u2206r (L\u221e (G)).\n\nThe following lemma describes how this conditional expectation acts on\nL\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G).\nLemma 3.9. The conditional expectation E : L\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G) \u2192 \u2206r (L\u221e (G))\nis determined by the equations\nE(u\u03b1ij \u2297 u\u03b2kl ) =\n\n\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 \u03b4j,k\n\u2206r (u\u03b1il )\nd\u03b1\n\n(\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 A, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , 1 \u2264 k, l \u2264 d\u03b2 ).\n\nFurthermore, E(C(G) \u2297 C(G)) \u2282 \u2206r (C(G)).\nProof. As usual, we identify L\u221e (G) as a subspace of L2 (G) (and likewise\nwe identify L\u221e (G)\u2297L\u221e (G) as a subspace of L2 (G) \u22972 L2 (G)). With these\nidentifications, E is is realized simply as the orthogonal projection from\nL2 (G) \u22972 L2 (G) onto L2 (\u2206r (L\u221e (G)).\nRecall that \u2206r : L\u221e (G) \u2192 \u2206r (L\u221e (G)) is trace preserving, and therefore\nextends to an isometry with dense range for the L2 -norms (i.e. a unitary operator from L2 (G) to L2 (\u2206r (L\u221e (G)).) Therefore \u2206r maps the orthonormal\n1/2\nbasis {d\u03b1 u\u03b1ij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A} for L2 (G) to the orthonormal basis\n1/2\n\n{\u2206r (d\u03b1 u\u03b1ij ) : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A} for L2 (\u2206r (L\u221e (G)). Therefore we can\n\nwrite E(u\u03b1ij \u2297 u\u03b2kl ) as the L2 -convergent series\nX X\n\u03b3\nhu\u03b1ij \u2297 u\u03b2kl |\u2206r (d\u03b31/2 u\u03b3ts )i\u2206r (d1/2\nE(u\u03b1ij \u2297 u\u03b2kl ) =\n\u03b3 uts )\n\u03b3\u2208A 1\u2264t,s\u2264d\u03b3\n\n=\n\nX\n\nd\u03b3\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\u2208A\n\n=\n\nd\u03b3\nX\n\nhu\u03b1ij \u2297 u\u03b2kl |u\u03b3tm \u2297 u\u03b3ms i\u2206r (u\u03b3ts )\n\n1\u2264t,s\u2264d\u03b3 m=1\n\n\u03b3\u2208A\n\nX\n\nX\n\nd\u03b3\n\nX\n\nd\u03b3\nX\n\u03b4i,t \u03b4j,m \u03b4k,m \u03b4l,s \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b3 \u03b4\u03b2,\u03b3\n\u2206r (u\u03b3ts )\n2\nd\u03b3\n\n1\u2264t,s\u2264d\u03b3 m=1\n\n\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 \u03b4j,k\n\u2206r (u\u03b1il ).\nd\u03b1\n\nTo see that E(C(G)\u2297 C(G)) \u2286 \u2206r (C(G)), note that from the above formula\nfor E, we have E(A\u2297alg A) \u2286 \u2206r (A). Since A\u2297alg A is dense in C(G)\u2297C(G),\n\u2206r (A) is dense in \u2206r (C(G)) and E is continuous, the result follows.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 3.7(2).\n3.1. Proof of Theorem 3.7(2). Let \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 be any Hahn-Banach extension of the given state \u03c8 \u2208 B \u2217 .

Therefore their composition Q\u03c6 is also NUCP\nand h-preserving, and Q\u03c6 (C(G)) \u2286 C(G) by Lemmas 3.4, 3.8 and 3.9. We\nnow claim that T\u03c8 = Q\u03c6 . This will complete the proof.\nTo show this, it suffices by the normality of the composition Q\u03c6 to check\nequality on the basis {u\u03b1ij : \u03b1 \u2208 A, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d\u03b1 } of the the \u03c3-weakly dense\nsubalgebra A \u2282 L\u221e (G).

As alluded to above, the composition (3.2) can be viewed\nas a type of average of the convolution operator S\u03c6 , with respect to the\nHaar trace. Indeed, consider the classical situation where G = (C(G), \u2206)\nis the usual C\u2217 -bialgebra of continuous functions on a compact group G,\nwith coproduct \u2206 given by \u2206f (x, y) = f (xy), (x, y \u2208 G, f \u2208 C(G)).

In the next lemma, we determine the spectrum of the\noperator \u03c71 in the full C\u2217 -algebra Ao (N ).\nLemma 4.2. Let N \u2265 2. Then the spectrum \u03c3Ao (N ) (\u03c71 ) of \u03c71 in the full\nC\u2217 -algebra Ao (N ) is the interval [\u2212N, N ].\nThis result is perhaps well known. Since we we could not find a reference,\nwe include a proof.\nProof. The fundamental corepresentation V 1 = V = [vij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N \u2208 MN (Ao (N ))\nis an N \u00d7 N orthogonal matrix.

Since the spectrum of any element of a C\u2217 -algebra always contains the spectrum of its image under any\n\u2217-homomorphism, we deduce that\n[\u2212N, N ] \u2286 \u03c3Ao (N ) (\u03c71 ).\n\n\u0003\n\nLet {un }\u221e\nn=0 denote the sequence of (dilated) Chebyshev polynomials of\nthe second kind, which are uniquely determined by the initial conditions\n(4.5)\n\nu0 (x) = 1, u1 (x) = x\n\nand the recursion\n(4.6)\n\nxun (x) = un+1 (x) + un\u22121 (x)\n\n(n \u2265 1).\n\n\fAPPROXIMATION PROPERTIES FOR FREE QUANTUM GROUPS\n\n15\n\nFrom Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.2, we immediately obtain the following.\nCorollary 4.3.

From (4.4), we have BN = C \u2217 h1, \u03c71 i.

It turns out that using free product constructions, the\ngroups {UN\n+\n+\n.\nis really a consequence of the HAP for ON\nHAP for UN\n\u2217\nLet A and B be unital C -algebras, we will denote their C\u2217 -algebraic free\nproduct by A \u2217 B ([28, Chapter 25]). If \u03c6 and \u03c8 are faithful states on A and\nB, respectively, we will denote by A \u2217red B the reduced free product of A\nand B, taken with respect to the free product state \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 (see [26, Lecture\n7]). If A and B are von Neumann algebras with normal faithful states \u03c6 and\n\u03c8, respectively, then we always take A \u2217red B to be the Neumann algebraic\nreduced free product [11]. We refer to [13] and [11] for the properties of\nreduced free products of (normal) completely positive maps.\nWe begin with the notion of free complexification for compact matrix\nquantum groups, which was introduced in [4]. Recall that a compact matrix quantum group G = (A, U ) is simply a CQG (A, \u2206), where U =\n[uij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N \u2208 MN (A) is a distinguished fundamental unitary corepresentation, with the property that its matrix elements generate A as a C\u2217 -algebra\n[39].\nDefinition 4.7. Let G = (A, U ) be a compact matrix quantum group, with\nfundamental corepresentation U = [uij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N \u2208 MN (A). Let T denote\nthe unit circle in C, and let z = idT \u2208 C(T) denote the canonical unitary\ngenerator of C(T). The free complexification of G is the compact matrix\n\n\f18\n\nMICHAEL BRANNAN\n\nquantum group G\u0303 = (\u00c3, \u0168 ) where \u00c3 \u2282 C(T) \u2217 A is the unital C\u2217 -algebra\ngenerated by the family {zuij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N } \u2282 C(T) \u2217 A, and \u0168 =\n[zuij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264N \u2208 MN (\u00c3). The fact that G\u0303 is actually a compact matrix\nquantum group is proved in [4].\nDenote by \u03c4 the Haar state on L\u221e (T), and hG the Haar state on L\u221e (G).\nIn [4] it is shown that L\u221e (G\u0303) (respectively C(G\u0303)) is the von Neumann\nsubalgebra of L\u221e (T) \u2217red L\u221e (G) (respectively C\u2217 -subalgebra of C(T) \u2217red\nC(G)) generated by {z\u03c0hG (uij ) : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N }. The Haar state hG\u0303 on\nL\u221e (G\u0303) is just the restriction of the free product state \u03c4 \u2217 hG to this von\nNeumann subalgebra.\nHere is the main result of this section.\nTheorem 4.8. Let G be a compact matrix quantum group of Kac type. If\nG has the HAP, then so does its free complexification G\u0303.\nProof. Suppose (M1 , \u03c41 ) and (M2 , \u03c42 ) are finite von Neumann algebras, each\nwith the HAP. Then the reduced free product (M1 \u2217red M2 , \u03c41 \u2217 \u03c42 ) also has\n(i)\nthe HAP [12, Proposition 3.9]. The main idea in [12] is that if {\u03a6\u03bbi : Mi \u2192\nMi }\u03bbi \u2208\u039bi is a net giving the HAP for (Mi , \u03c4i ), then the reduced free product\nnet\n(2)\n(1)\n{\u03a6\u03bb1 \u2217red \u03a6\u03bb2 : M1 \u2217red M2 \u2192 M1 \u2217red M2 }(\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 )\u2208\u039b1 \u00d7\u039b2 ,\ngives the HAP for (M1 \u2217red M2 , \u03c41 \u2217 \u03c42 ).\nIn particular, (L\u221e (T) \u2217red L\u221e (G), \u03c4 \u2217 hG ) has the HAP. Since L\u221e (G\u0303) is\na von Neumann subalgebra of (L\u221e (T) \u2217red L\u221e (G), \u03c4 \u2217 hG ), and \u03c4 \u2217 hG is a\nfaithful normal trace, there exists a unique normal, faithful \u03c4 \u2217hG -preserving\nconditional expectation E : L\u221e (T) \u2217red L\u221e (G) \u2192 L\u221e (G\u0303). Thus, if {\u03a6\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b\nis any net giving the HAP for (L\u221e (T) \u2217red L\u221e (G), \u03c4 \u2217 hG ), then the net\n{E \u25e6 \u03a6\u03bb |L\u221e (G\u0303) }\u03bb\u2208\u039b gives the HAP for (L\u221e (G\u0303), hG\u0303 ).\n\u0003\nAs a specific instance of Theorem 4.8, we deduce the HAP for the free\nunitary quantum groups.\n+\nhas the HAP.\nCorollary 4.9.

A dual operator space Y \u2217 is said to have the weak\u2217\ncompletely contractive approximation property (weak\u2217 -CCAP) if there is a\nnet of \u03c3-weakly continuous finite rank complete contractions {\u03a6\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u2282\nCB(Y \u2217 ), converging to idY \u2217 in the point \u03c3-weak topology.\nProof. In [23, Theorem 5.14], Kraus and Ruan showed that for a compact\nquantum group G = (A, \u2206) of Kac type, C(G) has the CCAP if and only if\nL\u221e (G) has the weak\u2217 -CCAP. (In [23], the authors state their results in the\nequivalent, dual framework of discrete Kac algebras.)\nHowever, as mentioned in the introduction, Banica has shown that L\u221e (U2+ ) \u223c\n=\nL(F2 ) (see [3]). Since L(F2 ) has the weak\u2217 -CCAP and this property is an\nisomorphism invariant for von Neumann algebras (see [14]), L\u221e (U2+ ) also\nhas the weak\u2217 -CCAP. The theorem now follows from the previous paragraph.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.11. It would be interesting to know whether or not all of the\n+\n+\n) have the CCAP, or perhaps just the\nor UN\nC\u2217 -algebras C(G) (G = ON\ncompletely bounded approximation property. Since we have shown that\nthese C\u2217 -algebras always have the MAP, the answer seems likely to be yes.\n(To our knowledge, there are no known examples of C\u2217 -algebras with the\nMAP, but not the CCAP.) We are currently investigating this problem.\nRemark 5.12. We conclude with the following Banach algebraic remark. Let\n+\n+\nfor some N \u2265 3. Since G is not cofor some N \u2265 2, or ON\nG be either UN\n1\namenable, the Banach algebra L (G) fails to have a bounded approximate\nidentity [10, Theorem 3.1]. However, our proofs of the MAP for C(G) can\nbe used to show that L1 (G) has a central approximate identity, which is\nbounded in the (left) multiplier norm on L1 (G):\nk\u03c9kM (L1 (G)) := sup{k\u03c9 \u2217 \u03c9 \u2032 kL1 (G) : k\u03c9 \u2032 kL1 (G) = 1}\n\n(\u03c9 \u2208 L1 (G)).\n\nIndeed, when G = U2+ , C(G) has the CCAP by Theorem 5.10, and [23, Theorems 5.14-5.15] show that L1 (G) has a central approximate identity which\nis actually bounded in the completely bounded multiplier norm on L1 (G).\nFor all other cases, let {\u03a6t }t\u2208\u039b be a net of finite rank contractions giving the\nMAP for C(G). From the proofs of Theorems 5.4 and 5.9, we may assume\nthat each \u03a6t is a finite linear\nP combination of the projections {p\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208A defined\nin Notation 3.6, say \u03a6t = \u03b1\u2208A at (\u03b1)p\u03b1 . Identify L1 (G) with the closure of\nL\u221e (G) with respect to the norm k\u03c9kL1 (G) := sup{|h(\u03c9x)| : kxkL\u221e (G) = 1}.\nP\nThen the net {\u03c9t }t\u2208\u039b \u2282 L1 (G) defined by \u03c9t := \u03b1\u2208A at (\u03b1)d\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 , is a central approximate identity for L1 (G) such that k\u03c9t kM (L1 (G)) = k\u03a6t kB(C(G)) =\n1 for all t \u2208 \u039b. The equality k\u03c9t kM (L1 (G)) = k\u03a6t kB(C(G)) follows from the\nsimple verification that \u03a6t = (m\u03c9t )\u2217 |C(G) , where m\u03c9t : \u03c9 \u2032 7\u2192 \u03c9t \u2217 \u03c9 \u2032 is the\n(left) multiplier induced by \u03c9t .\n\n\f28\n\nMICHAEL BRANNAN\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
