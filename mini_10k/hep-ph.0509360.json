Introduction\nA central issue on the agenda of the B factories is the precise determination of the CKM\nmatrix element Vub . Without undermining the significance of exclusive hadronic final\u2013\nstate analysis, measurements of the inclusive branching fraction of charmless semileptonic\ndecays, B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304, provide the safest and most accurate determination of |Vub | [1\u20137].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fTheoretically, because of the inclusive nature of the measurement, the calculation of\n\u0001\nthe width \u0393 B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 in units of |Vub |2 relies primarily on QCD perturbation theory.\nThe final state, which in reality is composed of light hadrons, can be safely described in\nthe course of the calculation by light quarks and gluons. Moreover, the dependence of the\nwidth on the internal dynamics of the decaying B meson is power suppressed. The Operator\nProduct Expansion (OPE) implies that the total decay width of a B meson is equal to the\ntotal decay width of a hypothetical on-shell b quark up to O(\u039b2 /m2b ) corrections, which\ncan be expressed as forward matrix elements of certain local operators whose numerical\nvalues are determined based on other measurements. These corrections are very small.\nThe main obstacle in extracting |Vub | from inclusive semileptonic decays is the need\nto eliminate the huge background due to B decay into charm. The most effective way to\nmaximize the rate while discriminating the charm background is to select events where the\nhadronic system has small mass, MX <\n\u223c 1.7 GeV, see e.g. [5, 7\u20139].\nBecause of the cuts, detailed theoretical understanding of the differential distribution is\nessential. In the small\u2013MX region the hadronic system is most likely jet-like. Working with\n2 = P + P \u2212 , the small M\nlightcone coordinates, P + \u2264 P \u2212 \u2264 MB with MX\nX region directly\n1\ncorresponds to the region where the smaller lighcone component gets small, P + \u2212\u2192 0, so\nit involves highly non-local correlation functions with large lightcone separation, y \u2212 \u2212\u2192 \u221e,\nwhere y \u2212 is the Fourier conjugate to P + . At leading power in O(\u039b/mb ) the differential\nwidth involves the full lightcone momentum distribution function of the b quark inside the\nmeson, the so-called \"shape function\" [10, 11]. On the non-perturbative level, not much is\nknown about this distribution: it is difficult to compute it on the lattice and although in\nprinciple it can be measured using the photon spectrum in rare radiative decays B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3,\nrealistic measurements constrain just the first few moments of this function [12, 13].\nAs it stands, the theoretical uncertainty in extracting |Vub | from inclusive semileptonic\ndecays is dominated by the uncertainty in estimating the effect of cuts. A great variety of\nexperimental cuts has been proposed, which either aim at reducing the sensitivity to the\nunknown momentum distribution of the b quark in the meson by cutting out the phase\u2013\nspace regions where it is important [14, 15], or alternatively, aim at making the relation\nwith the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 spectrum as direct as possible [16\u201319]. While the comparison between\nresults for |Vub | obtained using different cuts is useful for controlling experimental as well\nas theoretical uncertainties, better measurements can be achieved if cuts would be chosen\nbased on purely experimental considerations. Precise theoretical predictions for the fully\ndifferential width are therefore urgently needed.\n1.1 The applicability of perturbation theory\nIn perturbation theory, the fully differential width is currently known [20] to the next\u2013\nto\u2013leading order (NLO), which includes tree level as well as one\u2013loop, i.e. O(\u03b1s ), virtual\ncorrections, where the hadronic system is represented by a single on-shell u quark, as\nwell as bremsstrahlung contributions where the hadronic system is composed of a u-quark\nand a gluon, and therefore has a non-vanishing mass. It has long been recognized that\n1\n\nThe region where both lightcone components are small is power suppressed.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\ffixed\u2013order calculations do not provide even a qualitative description of the differential\nwidth in the small\u2013MX region, where multiple emission of soft and collinear gluons is\n\u2212\nimportant [21\u201331]. In terms of partonic2 lightcone coordinates, p+\nj \u2264 pj \u2264 mb , the small\n+ \u2212\nMX region is characterized by a large hierarchy, pj /pj \u226a 1. Higher\u2013order corrections\n\u2212\ncontaining Sudakov logarithms of the ratio p+\nj /pj are large, and they must be resummed\nto all orders to recover the characteristic Sudakov peak at small MX .\nAccording to the factorization properties of the fully differential width in inclusive\ndecays [21\u201331], Sudakov logarithms exponentiate in moment space. We shall work here\n\u2212\nwith moments n defined3 with respect to powers of 1 \u2212 p+\nj /pj , as in Eq. (3.18) below. The\nregion of interest, of small p+\nj , is probed by high moments, n \u2212\u2192 \u221e. The logarithms,\nln n, which become large in this limit, originate in two distinct subprocesses of different\ncharacteristic scales, which factorize in this moment space. The first is the final\u2013state jet\nhaving a constrained invariant mass squared of O(m2b /n) [30\u201332], which coincides with\nthe Sudakov factor of deep inelastic structure functions. The second corresponds to the\nquark distribution in an on-shell heavy quark, the perturbative analogue of the quark\ndistribution in the meson [30,31,33], and describes soft radiation, |k| \u223c O(mb /n), from the\nnearly on-shell heavy quark prior to the decay.\nA major stumbling block, which essentially prohibits the straightforward application\nof Sudakov resummation to inclusive B decay phenomenology, is that the scales involved\nare almost too low for perturbation theory to apply. While the b quark mass is heavy\ncompared to the QCD scale \u039b, in the Sudakov limit, n \u2212\u2192 \u221e, the jet mass scale is much\nlower than mb and the soft scale |k| \u223c O(mb /n) characterizing the quark distribution is yet\nmuch lower. Already at moderately high moments, n \u223c 10, the latter is dangerously close\nto \u039b where the physics in non-perturbative. On these grounds it is often argued [34,35] that\nSudakov resummation is useless in this case. Conversely, when Sudakov resummation is\napplied it is usually supplemented by an external infrared cutoff along with parametrization\nof the non-perturbative quark distribution function below this scale [16, 17].\nWhile there are many ways to partially bypass the need to resum corrections on the\nscale |k| \u223c O(mb /n), we argue that this resummation is in fact largely under control and\nthat it is very useful. Ref. [31] and the present investigation show that definite predictions\nemerge when the available information on the large\u2013order behavior of the perturbative\nexpansion is taken into account. The sensitivity to low momentum scales, and specifically\nto the meson structure, turns out to be smaller than it superficially appears to be, and\nconsequently the predictive power of perturbation theory is higher than what one might a\npriori expect.\nInfrared sensitivity appears in the moment\u2013space Sudakov exponent through infrared\nrenormalons [32, 33, 36\u201341]. These generate divergences and invalidate the logarithmic\naccuracy criterion [30, 31], but they definitely do not prohibit using Sudakov resummation altogether: the Sudakov exponent needs to be regarded as an asymptotic series, and\nsummed up to all orders by regularizing the renormalons in a systematic way. This is the\n\u00b1\nThe relation with the hadronic lightcone coordinates is p\u00b1\nj = P \u2212 \u039b\u0304 where \u039b\u0304 = MB \u2212mb , see Eq. (4.1).\nThere are other viable definitions for moments; an alternative is considered in Appendix A, see\nEq. (A.12) there.\n2\n\n3\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fessence of Dressed Gluon Exponentiation (DGE). The application of this approach to inclusive decays is particularly advantageous since the leading infrared renormalon ambiguity,\nwhich dictates the divergence of the series in the Sudakov exponent, cancels exactly with\nthe pole\u2013mass ambiguity that is carried by kinematic power corrections associated with\nthe conversion from partonic to hadronic variables. In this way, the on-shell calculation\nbecomes directly useful for phenomenology, in spite of the divergence of the series (or the\nambiguity) that appeared at the intermediate stage.\nIn the present paper we provide precise theoretical predictions for the fully differential\nwidth in semileptonic decays using DGE. Our calculation makes maximal use of Sudakov\nresummation and the underlying renormalon structure. In this way we effectively minimize\nthe role of the unknown non-perturbative component of the quark\u2013distribution function\nand the associated uncertainties.\nThe method of DGE was already proven successful in the application to the photon\nenergy spectrum in B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 decays [31, 41]. Specifically, the first two central moments\ndefined over the range E\u03b3 > E0 , were computed in [31] in an essentially perturbative fashion\n(see below) without involving any parametrization of the leading\u2013power quark distribution\nfunction. These predictions were later compared [41] with experimental measurements from\nBabar [42] over a wide range of cuts, E0 = 1.9 to 2.26 GeV, finding very good agreement.\n1.2 Comparison with alternative approaches\nIt is worthwhile re-examining from the present perspective the conventional approach to\ninclusive spectra, which is based on parametrizing the leading\u2013power non-perturbative\n\"shape function\" [10,11] in analogy with deep inelastic structure\u2013function phenomenology.\nLet us summarize the qualitative differences.\nIn Refs. [10, 11, 17] one begins by considering directly the kinematic region where the\nsmall lightcone component of the hadronic system is comparable to the momentum of the\nlight degrees of freedom in the meson, O(\u039b). In the mb \u2212\u2192 \u221e limit the long\u2013distance\ninteraction is captured by a single lightcone distribution, the \"shape function\". No attempt\nis made to compute this function, which is assumed non-perturbative from the beginning.\nThe \"shape function\" is parametrized and the parameters are fixed by a fit to the measured\nB\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 spectrum (see e.g. Sec. 4 in Ref. [17]). Owing to the universality of this function,\nthe result can be directly used in semi-leptonic decays. There is of course some bias owing\nto the functional form assumed. In practice this can be dealt with by varying the function,\nor better, by relating directly the semileptonic distribution to the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 data by\nweighted integrals [18, 19].\nOur approach is more ambitious: we wish to compute the spectrum. Relying on the\nfact that the heavy quark in the meson is rarely far off shell, we compute the on-shell decay\nspectrum and use it as a first approximation to the meson decay spectrum. In this approximation the quark distribution in the meson is replaced by its perturbative analogue, the\nquark distribution in an on-shell heavy quark - see Ref. [33] for the precise definition. A\nkey element in this approach is the systematic treatment of infrared renormalons. Most\nimportantly, this includes a systematic definition of the on-shell heavy quark state at the\nlevel of resummed perturbation theory. Having full control of the large\u2013order behavior\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fof the expansion, such definition is provided by Principal Value Borel summation. Upon\nconsistently using this definition in both the Sudakov exponent and the quark pole mass\n(which enters the computed spectrum through the conversion to hadronic variables) any\nO(\u039b/mb ) ambiguities are avoided. In this way resummed perturbation theory yields definite predictions for the on-shell decay spectrum. The latter provides an approximation\nto the meson decay spectrum that does not require any O(\u039b/mb ) non-perturbative power\ncorrections. Having established that, we study higher power corrections that constitute the\nratio between the moments of the physical spectrum and the computed one, which originate\nin the dynamical structure of the meson. While these corrections gradually increase with\nthe moment index n they have but a small effect on the global properties of the spectrum.\nIt should be emphasized that in reality the spectrum in the immediate vicinity of the\nendpoint, P + \u2243 0, cannot be accurately described by any of these approaches for two\nreasons: first, the number of relevant \"shape function\" parameters increases, and second,\nthe transition to the exclusive region, namely the hadronic structure of the final state, is\nnot addressed.\nRecent formulations of the \"shape function\" approach, e.g. [17], employ the tools of\nfactorization [21, 22] and can therefore make some use of Sudakov resummation. Nevertheless the resummation there effectively concerns the jet function only, as the \"shape\nfunction\" is defined at an intermediate scale of order of the jet mass. Moreover, the need\nto separate \"jet\" logarithms from \"soft\" ones requires a complicated infrared cutoff to be\nintroduced at any order in perturbation theory. The final answer is affected by residual\nscale and scheme dependence.\nIn contrast, in our formulation Sudakov resummation is applied also to the quark\u2013\ndistribution function. We thus make full use of the available perturbative information.\nMoreover, the on-shell decay spectrum we compute is itself renormalization group invariant:\nit is absolutely free of any factorization scale or scheme dependence; at the level of the\nSudakov factor, it is also free of renormalization\u2013scale dependence owing to the additional\nresummation of running\u2013coupling effects we perform.\nThe conclusion from Ref. [31] and the successful comparison with experimental data [41]\nis that when using DGE, the on-shell calculation, b \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3, converted into hadronic variables, directly provides a good approximation of the B meson decay spectrum. Notably,\nin contrast with any fixed\u2013order approximation, it has approximately correct physical support properties at large E\u03b3 . This implies, in particular, that in this framework the nonperturbative component of the lightcone momentum distribution function is small, and at\nthe present accuracy can even be neglected. This conclusion may be surprising: as discussed above, in other approaches the parametrization of this non-perturbative distribution\nis absolutely essential. In order to understand the difference one should recall that\n(1) The separation between the perturbative and non-perturbative components of the\nlightcone momentum distribution function depends on the convention adopted. In\nour approach, the calculated perturbative component is nothing but the quark distribution in an on-shell heavy quark. It requires renormalization owing to logarithmic\nultraviolet singularities, however, no infrared cutoff is needed. This distribution is\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\finfrared and collinear safe and therefore well\u2013defined to all orders in perturbation\ntheory. It requires of course Sudakov resummation, owing to the large hierarchy\nbetween the hard scale mb and the soft scale mb /n. In contrast, at the power level\nthe Sudakov exponent is infrared sensitive: its Borel sum has ambiguities scaling\nas powers of (n\u039b/mb ). In our approach these are regularized using the Principal\nValue prescription - this is how we define the perturbative component of the quark\ndistribution function.\n(2) Beyond the currently available logarithmic accuracy at which the quark distribution is known (next\u2013to\u2013next\u2013to\u2013leading logarithmic accuracy [33]), the DGE calculation makes use of additional information, which is important in constraining the\ncorresponding Borel sum. Most importantly, the exact cancellation of the leading\n(u = 1/2) renormalon ambiguity with kinematic power corrections involving the pole\nmass [30] is used to fix the corresponding residue [31]. In addition, the absence of\nthe next\u2013to\u2013leading renormalon (u = 1), which was proven in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit [30],\nis assumed here to be general. Thus, the dependence on the (Principal Value) prescription is eventually restricted to higher renormalons (u \u2265 3/2), which have limited\ninfluence on the spectrum - see Ref. [31] and below.\nFollowing the results of Refs. [31,41], our working assumption in this paper is that the\nproperly\u2013defined quark distribution in an on-shell heavy quark provides a good approximation to the quark distribution in the meson. In reality the two differ of course, and it\nis important to quantify the power corrections that distinguish between them, a task that\nwill require theoretical as well as experimental input. This, however, is beyond the scope\nof the present paper.\n1.3 The task and the strategy\nThe main task on which we embark here is to provide a reliable calculation of the partial\ndecay width with experimentally\u2013driven cuts. Priority is given to cuts that maximize the\n2 =\nrate, in particular [7] the charm\u2013discriminating cut on the hadronic mass P + P \u2212 < MX\n2\n(1.7 GeV) with an additional, experimentally unavoidable, mild cut on the charged lepton\nenergy El > 1 GeV. Our general strategy to extract |Vub | from data is based on separately\ncomputing:\n\u0001\n\u2022 The total charmless semileptonic width \u0393total B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 in units of |Vub |2 , using\nthe available NNLO result [43] and renormalon resummation.\n\u2022 The effect of experimental cuts as the event fraction\nRcut \u2261\n\n\u0393(B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 restricted phase space)\n,\n\u0393(B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 entire phase space)\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhich we compute using DGE and match to the fully differential NLO result in\nmoment space.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fThe partial branching ratio measured by the B factories can then be compared to\n\u0001\n\u2206B(B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 restricted phase space) = \u03c4B \u0393total B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 Rcut .\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe advantages in splitting the calculation of the partial width this way are:\n\n\u2022 The event fraction Rcut is free of the O(\u039b/mb ) renormalon ambiguity associated\nwith the overall factor m5b where mb is the quark pole mass. Note that O(n\u039b/mb )\ncut\u2013related renormalon ambiguities are present in the perturbative result for Rcut ,\nbut their effect is restricted to the moment\u2013space Sudakov exponent. Therefore, the\nperturbative expansion of the hard matching coefficient for Rcut is renormalon free\nand truly dominated by hard scales at higher orders.\n\u2022 The total charmless semileptonic width can be computed with NNLO accuracy and\nin a way that renormalon\u2013related O(\u039b/mb ) power effects explicitly cancel. One then\nobtains the total width with theoretical uncertainty as low as \u223c 6%. Such accuracy cannot be achieved in a direct calculation of the partial width in the restricted\nphase\u2013space since (1) the differential width is known in full only to NLO accuracy;\nand (2) while Sudakov resummation can be used to take into account parametrically\u2013\nenhanced corrections associated with the phase-space restriction, some residual uncertainty of both perturbative and non-perturbative nature remains. Quantitative\nestimates are provided in Sec. 4.2.\nThe paper is divided into three main sections. In Sec. 2 we compute the total semileptonic width using the NNLO result [43] and renormalon resummation. In Sec. 3 we present\nthe results for resummation of the triple\u2013differential width and work out NLO matching\nformulae in moment space. Finally, in Sec. 4 we use these results to compute the differential and partially\u2013integrated width in hadronic variables, taking into account the mass\ndifference between the B meson and the b quark. In this section we study the theoretical\nuncertainty in Rcut and extract |Vub | from recent measurements by Belle [7].\n\n2. The total charmless semileptonic decay width\nAccording to the OPE the total B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 decay width is given by\n\u0001\nG2 |Vub |2 m5b\nF (\u03b1s (mb ))\n(2.1)\n\u0393total B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 = F\n192\u03c0 3\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 \u0013#\n\u0013\nG2F |Vub |2 m5b\n\u03b1s (mb ) 2\n\u039b\n\u03b1s (mb )\n=\n+ a1\n+ *** + O\n1 + a0\n,\n3\n192\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nm2b\nwhere the perturbative expansion has been computed to NNLO [43] and the matrix ele\u0001\nments controlling the O \u039b2 /m2b terms are not large and amount to \u223c 1% correction.\nIt is well known [44\u201346] that while the decay width receives just small O(\u039b2 /m2b )\npower corrections, the perturbative expansions of (a) the ratio between the pole mass\nand short\u2013distance masses (e.g. mMS\nb ); and (b) the function F (\u03b1s (mb )) in Eq. (2.1) have\nlarge O(\u039b/mb ) renormalon ambiguities owing to infrared sensitivity. Furthermore, the\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\ffirst few terms in these expansions show poor convergence; the asymptotic behavior sets\nin early. A practical problem one needs to address is how to optimally use the known\ncoefficients in these expansions to get a reliable estimate of \u0393total in Eq. (2.1). Often\n(e.g. [17, 34]) this problem is solved by resorting to a specific mass scheme where the mass\nand the perturbative expansion of the width are separately renormalon free, and hopefully\nconverge well. Our approach is different. We use the pole mass itself and regularize the\nleading renormalon using Borel summation4 , explicitly using the cancellation in Eq. (2.1).\nIn Ref. [31] we studied the mass ratio and expressed it as a Borel integral where the\nBorel function is written as a bi-local expansion [48\u201350]\n#\n\"\nZ\nkX\nimax\nmax\nmb\nq\nCF \u221e X\nk\ni\n(2.2)\n1+\nck (1 \u2212 2z) ,\nbi z +\n= 1+\ndz\n1\n\u03b20 0\nmMS\n(1 \u2212 2z)1+ 2 \u03b4\nb\ni=0\nk=1\nwhere \u03b4 \u2261 \u03b21 /\u03b202 , ck depend on the coefficients of the \u03b2 function (see Appendix B in [31]),\nand the coefficients bi in the regular part of the expansion can be determined through order\nb2 knowing the N3 LO result [51] for the mass ratio. Here both the exact analytic structure of\nthe singularity [52] and the value of the residue q fixing the large\u2013order asymptotic behavior\nof the expansion are used. The latter can be determined with <\n\u223c 3% accuracy [31,50,53,54]\n3\nusing the N LO result for the mass ratio. Hence, given a definite integration prescription\nin the complex z plain to avoid the z = 21 singularity, Eq. (2.2) facilitates an accurate\ncalculation of both the O(1) real and the O(\u039b/mb ) imaginary parts of the mass ratio.\nWith the central values of the residue from Ref. [31],\nCF q(Nf = 3)/\u03c0 = 0.560;\n\nCF q(Nf = 4)/\u03c0 = 0.536,\n\n(2.3)\n\nmb\nmMS\nb\n\n(2.4)\n\none obtains:\nmb\nmMS\nb\n\n= 1.161 \u2212 0.0934 i\nNf =3\n\n= 1.164 \u2212 0.0768 i,\nNf =4\n\nrespectively. The variation in the number of light fermions is used to estimate charm mass\neffects. Here we chose to define the Borel sum in Eq. (2.2) with the integration contour\ngoing below the real axis avoiding the singularity at z = 21 . This fixes the imaginary part\nof the mass ratio (the physical real part is prescription independent). We evaluated the\nintegrals using:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u03c0\nA\ne\u2212l l\u03bd\ne\u2212z/A\nz0\ne\u2212z0 /A (\u2212z0 /A)\u03bd\ndl\ndz \u0010\n=\n\u00111+\u03bd =\nlA\n\u0393(1 + \u03bd) 0\n\u0393(1\n+\n\u03bd)\nsin(\u03c0\u03bd)\n1\n\u2212\nz\n0\nz0\n1 \u2212 z0\n\u0015\n\u2212 21 z0 /A \u0014\n1\n1\n1\u2212 21 \u03bd 2 \u03bd e\n+A\nM 1 \u03bd, 1 \u2212 1 \u03bd (z0 /A) \u2212 M1+ 1 \u03bd, 1 \u2212 1 \u03bd (z0 /A) ,\nz0\n(2.5)\n2 2\n2\n2 2\n2\n1\u2212\u03bd\n\u03bd\n4\n\nThe possibility to determine the normalization of leading renormalon residues using the structure of the\nsingularity and the first few orders in the perturbative expansion was considered by T. Lee (in a different\ncontext) already in [47]. It was further observed that this information can be used to systematically\nconstruct a bi-local expansion for the Borel transform [49]. Then Pineda found [50] that in the case of the\npole mass the residue can be accurately determined, and used it to subtract the corresponding divergence.\nMore recently, it was shown that the Principal Value Borel\u2013resummed pole mass can be directly computed\nfrom the bi-local expansion [31, 48] and used as an alternative to short\u2013distance or renormalon\u2013subtracted\nmass definitions.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fwhere we assumed that z0 = 12 + i\u03b5 where \u03b5 is an infinitesimally small positive number, and\nM\u03bc,\u03bd (a) is the Whittaker M function,\n\u0012h\ni h\ni \u0013\n1\n\u2212 12 a 21 +\u03bd\nM\u03bc,\u03bd (a) = e\n+ \u03bd \u2212 \u03bc , 1 + 2\u03bd , a .\na\n1 F1\n2\nThe next crucial observation is that the cancellation of the leading renormalon ambiguity in Eq.

Using (\u03bb, r, x) the virtual\ncoefficients are:\nw0 = 12 (2 \u2212 x \u2212 \u03bb) (x + \u03bb \u2212 1)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n5 \u03c02\n\u2212 Li2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\nw1 = 12 (2 \u2212 x \u2212 \u03bb) (x + \u03bb \u2212 1) \u2212 \u2212\n4\n3\n+6(2 \u03bb + 2 x \u2212 5) ln(\u03bb) (x + \u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fand the real\u2013emission coefficient is:\nk1 (\u03bb, r, x) =\n\n+\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n6ln r\n(x\n\u2212\n2\n+\n\u03bb\n+\nr\n\u03bb)\nr\n\u03bb(1\n\u2212\n\u03bb)\n+\nx\n+\n\u03bb\n\u2212\n1\n\u00d7\nr (r \u2212 1)2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\n3 2\n3\n2\n2 2\n2\n2 + 2r + r \u03bb \u2212 2r \u03bb \u2212 6r \u03bb + r \u03bb + 2r + 2r \u2212 2r\u03bb\n\n(3.9)\n\n3\n(\u03bb + r \u03bb \u2212 r \u03bb2 + x \u2212 1) (x \u2212 2 + \u03bb + r \u03bb) \u00d7\nr(1 \u2212 r)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 2\n2\n2\n4 r \u03bb \u2212 10 r \u03bb + 7 r + 2 r \u2212 10 r \u03bb + 7\n\n6 (\u22122 r 2 \u03bb + 2 r 2 + r 2 \u03bb2 \u2212 2 r \u03bb + 4 r + 2) (\u22121 + r \u03bb) (\u22121 + \u03bb) \u03bb ln(r)\n(1 \u2212 r)2\n2\n2\n2\n3 (r \u03bb \u2212 8 r \u03bb + 8 r + r \u03bb + 8) (\u22121 + r \u03bb) (\u22121 + \u03bb) \u03bb\n+\n1 \u2212 r\u0014\n6(x \u2212 1 + r \u03bb)(\u03bb + x \u2212 1) ln r\n\u2212 14 r + 42 r 2 \u03bb \u2212 2 r \u03bb2 \u2212 2 r 4 \u03bb2 + 16 r 3 \u03bb\n\u2212\n(1 \u2212 r)4\n\n+\n\n+ 2 r 4 \u03bb \u2212 22 r 2 \u03bb\u00152 + 16 r \u03bb \u2212 4 r 3 + 2 \u03bb \u2212 22 r 3 \u03bb2\u0014\u2212 14 r 2 + \u03bb3 r 4 \u2212 4\n3(x \u2212 1 + r \u03bb) (\u22121 + \u03bb + x)\n6 r 3 \u03bb3 + 11 r 3 \u03bb \u2212 16 r 3 \u03bb2\n+ 4 r 3 \u03bb3 + r 2 \u03bb3 \u2212\n(1 \u2212 r)3\n\u0015\n2\n2 2\n2\n2 3\n2\n+ 67 r \u03bb \u2212 64 r \u03bb \u2212 22 r + 6 r \u03bb \u2212 16 r \u03bb \u2212 28 r + 67 r \u03bb \u2212 22 + 11 \u03bb .\nThe r \u2212\u2192 0 singular (non integrable) terms in k1 , namely\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0015\nln r\n7 1\nsing.\nk1 (\u03bb, r, x) = \u221212 (2 \u2212 x \u2212 \u03bb) (x + \u03bb \u2212 1)\n+\nr \u2217 4 r \u2217\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n7 1\nln r\n+\n= \u2212w0\nr \u2217 4 r \u2217\nare regularized as ()\u2217 distributions, i.e.\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ r0\nZ r0 \u0010\n\u00111\n1\ndrF (r)\ndr F (r) \u2212 F (0) ,\n= F (0) ln r0 +\nr \u2217\nr\n0\n0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ r0\nZ r0 \u0010\n\u0011\nln r\nln r\n1\ndrF (r)\ndr F (r) \u2212 F (0)\n,\n= F (0) ln2 r0 +\nr \u2217\n2\nr\n0\n0\n\n(3.10)\n\n(3.11)\n(3.12)\n\nwhere F (r) is a smooth test function.

(\u03bb, r, x)\n\n(3.13)\n\nis integrable, so it does not require any regularization.\nAs usual, at O(\u03b1s ) and beyond the separation into real and virtual terms is not unique.\nIn order to compare the result quoted here with NLO expressions for the triple differential\nwidth in terms of other kinematic variables (e.g. in [20]) one must take account of the\nfact that terms proportional to \u03b4(r) are contained both in the ()\u2217 distributions and in the\nvirtual terms and, depending on the variables chosen, they may be split differently between\nthe two.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f3.2 The Sudakov exponent\nOwing to multiple soft and collinear gluon emission, Sudakov logarithms, such as the\nr \u2212\u2192 0 singular terms of Eq. (3.10), appear at any order in perturbation theory. Such\nterms spoil the convergence of the perturbative expansion and must be resummed. Sudakov\nlogarithms in inclusive decay spectra are associated with two independent subprocesses [21,\n30, 31, 40] (see also Refs. [22\u201329]): the soft function, which is the Sudakov factor of the\nheavy quark distribution function [33] and the jet function, summing up radiation that is\nassociated with an unresolved final\u2013state quark jet of a given invariant mass. This function\nis directly related to the large-x limit of deep inelastic structure functions; see Ref. [31, 32]\nfor further details.\nSingular terms in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit\nRef. [30] has generalized the concept of Sudakov resummation in inclusive decay spectra\nbeyond the perturbative (logarithmic) level. It has been shown that, when considered\nto all orders, the moments corresponding to each of the above subprocesses contain infrared renormalons and therefore certain power corrections exponentiate together with the\nlogarithms.\nThe calculation in Ref. [30] was based on evaluating the real\u2013emission diagrams with\na single dressed gluon using the Borel technique: the dimension of the gluon propagator is\nmodified: 1/(\u2212k2 ) \u2212\u2192 1/(\u2212k2 )1+u , and in this way one gains control of the physical scale\nfor the running coupling. Ref. [30] used the leptonic and partonic invariant mass variables\nz \u2261 q 2 /m2b and 1 \u2212 \u03be \u2261 p2j /m2b , that are related to the lightcone variables of Eq. (3.2) by:\nz = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)(1 \u2212 \u03bb);\n\n\u03be = 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1,\n\n(3.14)\n\nand obtained the following result for the \u03be \u2212\u2192 1 singular terms in the triple differential\nwidth in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit:\n\u001a\n1 d\u0393(\u03be, z, x)\n= 12 (x \u2212 z)(1 + z \u2212 x) \u00d7 \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03be) +\n(3.15)\n\u03930 dzdxd\u03be \u03be\u2212\u21921\n\u0012 2 \u0013u h\nZ\ni\u001b\nCF \u221e du\n\u039b\n\u22121\u22122u\n\u22121\u2212u\n2u\nBS (u)(1 \u2212 z) (1 \u2212 \u03be)\n\u2212 BJ (u) (1 \u2212 \u03be)\n+ ***\n+\nT (u)\n\u03b20 0 u\nm2b\nwhere the dots stand for terms that are subleading in \u03b20 or are suppressed by powers of\n(1 \u2212 \u03be), and the Borel functions corresponding to the two Sudakov anomalous dimensions\nare:\n5\n\nBS (u) = e 3 u (1 \u2212 u) + O(1/\u03b20 ),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nsin \u03c0u\n1\n1 5u\n+\n+ O(1/\u03b20 ).\nBJ (u) = e 3\n2\n1 \u2212 u 1 \u2212 u/2\n\u03c0u\n\n(3.16)\n\nHere and below we use the scheme\u2013invariant Borel transform [57] where T (u) is the Laplace\nconjugate of the coupling. In the large\u2013\u03b20 limit (one\u2013loop running) T (u) = 1. Below we\nwork in the full theory and define T (u) as the Laplace conjugate of the 't Hooft coupling,\nsee Eq. (2.18) in Ref. [31].\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fEq. (3.15) reveals the physical scales that control the running coupling within the soft\nand the jet subprocess, respectively: the soft scale is |k| \u223c mb (1 \u2212 \u03be)/(1 \u2212 z) while the\ninvariant mass squared of the jet is k2 \u223c m2b (1 \u2212 \u03be).\nExponentiation\nSudakov resummation can be done using different variables. One natural possibility is\nto resum Sudakov logarithms of 1 \u2212 \u03be, corresponding to the limit where the hadronic\ninvariant mass gets small, for fixed leptonic invariant mass z. This avenue is followed in\nAppendix A. Here instead we choose to revert to the lightcone variables of Eq. (3.2), where\nthe exponent and the matching procedure are simpler. The comparison with Appendix A\nprovides a useful consistency check.\nThe Sudakov limit \u03be \u2212\u2192 1 corresponds to the phase\u2013space limit where the smaller\nlightcone momentum component \u03c1 tends to zero. The large component \u03bb can either be\nsmall or of O(1); fortunately, the region where also \u03bb is small is power suppressed in the\nBorn\u2013level weight (see Eq. (C.2)) and is therefore unimportant. Consequently, Sudakov\nresummation can be readily applied to resum logarithms of \u03c1 or of r. The latter possibility\nis particularly attractive. The singular terms for r \u2212\u2192 0 in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit take the\nform:\n\u001a\n1 d\u0393(\u03bb, r, x)\n= w0 \u03b4(r) +\n\u03930 d\u03bbdrdx r\u2212\u21920\n\u0012 2 \u0013u\n\u001b\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u039b\nCF \u221e du\n\u22121\u22122u\n\u22121\u2212u\nT (u)\nBS (u)r\n\u2212 BJ (u)r\n+ * * * , (3.17)\n+\n\u03b20 0 u\nm2b \u03bb2\n\nso both the soft and jet functions depend just on r, except for an overall dependence on \u03bb\nthat scales the argument of the coupling. It is this dependence that makes the difference\nwith the radiative decay case [31], which simply corresponds to the substitution of \u03bb = 1\nin Eq. (3.17).\nMultiple emission of soft and collinear gluons is taken into account to all orders by\nexponentiation of the fully differential width in moment space. It is necessary to consider\nthe fully differential width, since only then the hard configuration, from which soft and\ncollinear gluons are radiated, is fixed5 . The integration over the variables \u03bb and x that\ncontrol the hard configuration itself can only be performed after exponentiation has been\ncarried out. Exponentiation takes place in moment space because the phase space of soft\nand collinear radiation factorizes there.

(3.17) generate\nterms that contain powers of ln n, while integrable terms generate O(1/n) terms, that are\n5\n\nThis point has recently been pointed out in Ref. [23]. We note that the variable u introduced in that\npaper is identical to our variable r.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fneglected at this stage. These terms will eventually be taken into account (to a given\norder) by matching the resummed result to a fixed\u2013order expression. The resummed,\ntriple differetial distribution can then be computed to all orders by the following inverse\nMellin transformation:\n1 d\u0393(\u03bb, r, x)\n=\n\u03930 d\u03bbdrdx\n\nZ\n\nc+i\u221e\nc\u2212i\u221e\n\ndn d\u0393n (\u03bb, x)\n(1 \u2212 r)\u2212n .\n2\u03c0i d\u03bbdx\n\n(3.19)\n\nComputing the moments in Eq. (3.18) with Eq. (3.17) and exponentiating the terms that\ndiverge in the large\u2013n limit we get the following DGE formula:\n\u0012 2 \u0013u\n\u001a\nZ\n\u039b\nCF \u221e du\nd\u0393n (\u03bb, x)\n\u221e\nT (u)\n= [V (\u03bb, x) + \u2206R (\u03bb, x)] \u00d7 exp\n(3.20)\nd\u03bbdx large n\n\u03b20 0 u\nm2b \u03bb2\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n2u\nu\nBS (u)\u0393(\u22122u) n \u2212 1 \u2212 BJ (u)\u0393(\u2212u) (n \u2212 1)\n+ O(1/n)\nwhere the square brackets that multiply the Sudakov factor contain the virtual terms\nV (\u03bb, x) of Eq. (3.5) as well as \u2206R\u221e that is defined as the n \u2212\u2192 \u221e limit of the difference\nbetween the moments of the full real\u2013emission contribution R(\u03bb, r, x) and the terms that\nare included in the exponent, at any given order. \u2206R\u221e will be determined in the next\nsection at O(\u03b1s ) in the process of matching Eq. (3.20) to the full NLO expression; see Eqs.\n(3.35) and (3.37).\nEq. (3.20) summarizes the exact, all\u2013order structure of the Sudakov factor. Comparing\nEq. (3.20) to Eq. (3.17), which was derived in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit, one notes that terms that\nare subleading in \u03b20 arise from several sources: (1) the exponentiation; (2) the function T (u)\nsummarizing the dependence on the two\u2013loop \u03b2 function coefficient \u03b21 ; (3) the anomalous\u2013\ndimension functions BS (u) and BJ (u) that receive O(1/\u03b20 ) contributions starting at O(u).\nThe Sudakov factor in B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 [31] can be recovered by substituting \u03bb = 1 in Eq. (3.20).\nThe perturbative expansions of BS (u) and BJ (u) have recently been determined [31,33]\nto O(u2 ), i.e. the NNLO; explicit expressions appear in Sec. 2.2 in [31], see Eq. (3.27)\nbelow. In the following we shall compute the Borel sum in Eq. (3.20) directly, using the\nPrincipal Value prescription.

The three curves end at r \u2243 0.028, where the resummed results\nbecome complex owing to the Landau singularity at \u03c9 = 1/2.\n\ndifferences between curves corresponding to increasing logarithmic accuracy demonstrate\nthe problematic nature of this expansion, in which infrared renormalons (in particular the\none at u = 12 ) are unregulated. This problem is solved in what follows by computing the\nmoment\u2013space Sudakov exponent using Borel summation.\nCalculation of the Sudakov factor by Borel summation\nDirect evaluation of the Borel integral in the Sudakov exponent of Eq. (3.20) using the\nPrincipal\u2013Value prescription makes optimal use of the known all\u2013order structure of the\nexponent. In the context of DGE for inclusive spectra, this regularization has been proven\neffective in several respects [31]:\n\u2022 No Landau singularities are present.\n\u2022 It provides a systematic definition of the perturbative sum. Using this definition,\ncancellation of ambiguities can be realized - this has been explicitly used for the\nleading renormalon ambiguity associated with the pole mass.\n\u2022 The Sudakov factor is a real\u2013valued function of the moment variable.\n\u2022 The resummed spectra has modified support properties. With the appropriate BS (u)\n(see below), the support is close to that of the physical non-perturbative distribution.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fThe calculation of the Borel sum in Eq. (3.20) in a given regularization for the renormalons, requires, in principle, the knowledge of BS (u) and BJ (u) for any positive u. In\ncontrast to the large\u2013\u03b20 limit (3.16), analytic expressions for these functions in QCD are\nnot known. The fixed\u2013logarithmic\u2013accuracy approach described above uses only the expansion of these functions, as well as factors \u0393(\u22122u) and \u0393(\u2212u) that multiply them, around\nthe origin (u = 0). As discussed in detail in Sec. 2.3 in Ref. [31], one may use additional\ninformation on the Borel functions BS (u) and BJ (u) to constrain further the Sudakov factor. Most importantly, BS (u) at u = 12 was determined in Ref. [31] with a good accuracy\nusing the cancellation [30] of the leading infrared renormalon ambiguity in the Sudakov\nfactor with that of the pole mass.\nTo understand the origin of renormalons in the Sudakov factor note that the integration\nover r near the r \u2212\u2192 0 limit necessarily involves some contribution from the infrared region.\n\u00bfFrom Eq. (3.21) it is obvious that for small r the coupling is evaluated at small momentum\nscales, where it is out of perturbative control. In the Borel formulation, when computing\nthe moments in Eq. (3.18) where the integrand is given by Eq. (3.17), the integration\ngives rise to the factors \u0393(\u22122u) and \u0393(\u2212u) in the soft and jet parts of the exponent,\nrespectively. These factors contain infrared renormalons poles at integer and half integer\nvalues of u. This way infrared sensitivity translates into power\u2013like ambiguity of the\nBorel sum [30, 31, 36\u201339], corresponding to powers of n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ) and n\u039b2 /(\u03bbmb )2 in the\nsoft and jet factors, respectively; the latter are obviously less important than the former.\nAs shown in Refs. [30, 31], the leading power ambiguity on the soft scale proportional to\n(n \u2212 1)\u039b/(\u03bbmb ), cancels exactly with kinematic power corrections. In the present context\nsuch corrections arise when expressing r in terms of the hadronic variables; see Sec. 4.\nSubleading power ambiguities on the soft scale, corresponding to powers of (n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))j\nwith7 j \u2265 3, are related to the momentum distribution of the b quark in the meson. In\nprinciple, these ambiguities are removed only upon including a non-perturbative function,\nnamely an infinite set of power corrections, that makes for the difference between the quark\ndistribution in an on-shell heavy quark and that in a meson. The closer to the endpoint\none cuts the distribution, the larger is the weight of high moments, and with it the significance of these power corrections. Our analysis of the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 decay [31] has shown\nthat if BS (u) is sufficiently constrained (see below) and kinematic power corrections are\nincluded, one can determine the photon\u2013energy spectrum to a good accuracy neglecting\nany additional non-perturbative power corrections.\nIn principle, the theoretical uncertainty associated with the unknown form of the\nanomalous dimension BS (u) away from the origin, and the unknown non-perturbative\npower terms that characterize the quark distribution in the meson are two completely\ndistinct issues. In reality, however, both result in similar, parametrically\u2013enhanced power\neffects, and are therefore impossible to distinguish phenomenologically.\nThe approach we take in this paper follows closely what was done in Ref. [31]: starting\nwith the large\u2013\u03b20 result for BS (u) and BJ (u), we include O(u) and O(u2 ) terms to obtain\nthe exact exponent to NNLO. For BS (u) we further include O(u3 ) and higher\u2013order terms\n7\n\nThe absence of ambiguity of O((n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))2 ) is discussed below.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fso as to match the computed residue of at u = 21 , getting8\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u0013\u0015 \u001b\n5\nCA 5 2 7 9\n1\n2\nu\nBS (u) = e 3 (1 \u2212 u) exp c2 u +\n\u03c0 + \u2212 \u03b63 u2 \u00d7 W (u),\nc3 \u2212 c2 +\n2\n\u03b20 18\n9 2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nsin \u03c0u\n1\n1 5\n1\n+\n\u00d7\n(3.27)\nBJ (u) = e 3 u\n2\n1 \u2212 u 1 \u2212 u/2\n\u03c0u\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u001b\n\u0012\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015 2\nCA 29 2 43\n3\n\u03c0\nu\nCF\n2\n3\nexp c2 u + c3 \u2212 c2 +\n\u03c0 \u2212\n\u2212 5\u03b63 +\n+ 3\u03b63\n+ O(u ) ,\n\u2212 +\n\u03b20 72\n72\n\u03b20\n4\n16\n2!\nwhere c2,3 are given in Eq.

(2.30), (2.36) and (4.8) in [31] with Nf = 4) and an arbitrary\nnormalization constant C at u = 23 .\nWe stress that the ansatz of Eq. (3.27) assumes that BS (u) vanishes at u = 1 and has\nno other zeros at positive u, as in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit (3.16). The constraint BS (u = 1) = 0\nwas found to be quite important [31]. Here we explicitly assume that it holds in the\nfull theory and do not investigate the possibility of it being violated. The vanishing of\nBS (u = 1) implies in particular that the perturbative Sudakov factor of Eq. (3.20) is free\nof O((n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))2 ) ambiguities9 . Thus, after the cancellation of the u = 21 ambiguity, the\nleading ambiguity is O((n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))3 ), as already mentioned. To the extent that renormalons do indeed give good indication of which non-perturbative effects are important,\nthe absence of the u = 1 renormalon is well supported by the successful comparison of the\nprediction for the first two cut moments in B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 with experimental data.\nNote also that Eq. (3.27) tends to zero at asymptotically large u. In this respect it\ndiffers from the large\u2013\u03b20 limit. It is important to stress though that convergence of the\nBorel integrals at large u is guaranteed independently of this assumption, owing to the\nfactors \u0393(\u22122u) and \u0393(\u2212u) in Eq. (3.20).\nIn Eq. (3.27) we parametrize BS (u) at intermediate u values by a single parameter C.\nWhen BS (u) is inserted into Eq. (3.20) this number determines the renormalon residue at\nu = 32 . The effect of C on the function BS (u) is shown if Fig. 2. While the actual residue in\nthe full theory is not known, it is expected to be smaller than in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit, where\nBS (u = 3/2) \u2243 \u22126.09. Such a large residue can be obtained in the ansatz of Eq. (3.27)\n8\n\nThis specific ansatz was called 'model (c)' in Ref. [31].\nA well-known analogous situation is the absence of the leading renormalon ambiguity [62] in Drell\u2013\nYan production [63]. Also there parametrically\u2013enhanced power corrections appear, which are related to\nrenormalon ambiguities in the Sudakov exponent [37]. However, based on the analytic structure of the soft\nSudakov anomlaous dimension computed in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit, the first power correction is assumed not to\nappear.\n9\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 2: The function BS (u) with vertical lines indicating the positions of possible renormalons\nowing to the poles of \u0393(\u22122u) in Eq.

Thus, upon\napplying this approximation one returns to Eq. (3.20). There, only powers of ln n appear\nat any given order in u, while constants and O(1/n) terms are entirely excluded from the\nexponent and appear only in the matching coefficient. In Eq. (3.43) such terms appear also\nin the exponent.\nIt is straightforward to match the Sudakov factor of Eq. (3.43) to NLO. The result\nis more elegant than when using a \"purely logarithmic\" Sudakov factor (Eq. (3.40) or\nEq. (3.39)) because the constants for n \u2212\u2192 \u221e, which where included there in the process\nof matching, appear in Eq. (3.43) as part the exponent. This is true at higher orders too:\nwhen using Eq. (3.43), \u2206R\u221e = 0. Consequently, it is just the purely virtual terms V (\u03bb, x)\n(terms proportional to \u03b4(r), after the ()+ distributions have been defined) that must be\nmultiplied by the Sudakov factor in order to generate correctly the log\u2013enhanced terms at\nhigher orders.

(3.43) the parametric enhancement of power corrections is not as\ndramatic as it looks based on Eq. (3.20). In Eq. (3.43) integer moments are entirely free\nof certain power\u2013like ambiguities which do show up in Eq. (3.20): according to the residue\nstructure of Eq. (3.43), for n = N , N being a positive integer, only powers (\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))j\nwith j < N appear.\n10\n\nAs discussed in Sec. 4 below, the j = 1 ambiguity cancels upon converting to hadronic variables and the\nj = 2 renormalon is absent since BS (1) = 0. Thus, dynamical non-perturbative power corrections actually\nappears only for j \u2265 3.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fA priori, one might expect that all power corrections would become of order one at\nn \u223c \u03bbmb /\u039b. Assuming that renormalon ambiguities do indeed give good indication on\nnon-perturbative effects, the factorial suppression of Eq. (3.50) as well as the n dependence of the residues of Eq. (3.43) imply that power terms are altogether less important\nand, in contrast with the naive expectation, the power expansion corresponding to higher\nrenormalons in Eq. (3.48) does not break down.\n3.5 Resummed double\u2013differential width with a lepton\u2013energy cut\nSince the dependence on the lepton energy fraction x appears in the resummation formula\n(3.45) only though the phase\u2013space limits and the matching coefficients but not through\nthe Sudakov factor, it is possible to integrate over x analytically to obtain the double\ndifferential width with a cut x > x0 :\nZ c+i\u221e\n1 d\u0393(\u03bb, r, x > x0 )\ndn d\u0393n (\u03bb, x > x0 )\n=\n(1 \u2212 r)\u2212n\n(3.52)\n\u03930\nd\u03bbdr\n2\u03c0i\nd\u03bb\nc\u2212i\u221e\nwhere, based on Eq.

(3.7) and\nthe real\u2013emission moments of Eq. (3.46), respectively.\n\n4. Partial width with experimentally relevant cuts in hadronic variables\n4.1 Conversion to hadronic variables and power corrections\nSo far we examined the resummed distribution in kinematic variables associated with the\npartonic jet initiated by the u-quark. Measurements do not distinguish between the u-quark\njet and the soft partons originating in the light degrees of freedom in the meson. Working\nstill in the approximation where the b quark is on shell, one defines v \u2261 pB /MB (where\nv 2 = 1) so pb = mb v and the momentum of the light degrees of freedom is \u039b\u0304v = (MB \u2212mb )v.\nThe hadronic variables (in the B rest frame) are then: EH = Ej + \u039b\u0304, where \u039b\u0304 = MB \u2212 mb ,\nand P~H = p~j . The relations with the corresponding hadronic lightcone variables are (cf.\nEq. (3.2)):\nP + = EH \u2212 |P~H | = \u039b\u0304 + Ej \u2212 |~\npj | = mb \u03c1 + \u039b\u0304,\nP \u2212 = EH + |P~H | = \u039b\u0304 + Ej + |~\npj | = mb \u03bb + \u039b\u0304.\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fIn the small hadronic\u2013mass\u2013squared (P + P \u2212 ) region, \u03c1 is small, and the \u039b\u0304 term in P + is\nabsolutely essential. On the other hand, the subregion where also \u03bb is small (P \u2212 is of order\n\u039b) is unimportant because it is power suppressed by the Born\u2013level weight (see Eq. (C.2)).\nNevertheless, as we carefully treated all other O(\u039b/mb ) effects, we do not neglect \u039b\u0304 compared to mb \u03bb when converting the decay width to hadronic variables.\nIn terms of hadronic variables the total phase space is:\n\u0393total =\n\nZ\n\nMB /2\n\ndEl\n0\n\nZ\n\nMB\nMB \u22122El\n\ndP \u2212\n\nZ\n\nMB \u22122El\n0\n\ndP +\n\nd\u0393(P + , P \u2212 , El )\n.\ndP + dP \u2212 dEl\n\n(4.2)\n\nA perturbative calculation of the differential width obviously cannot fill the entire hadronic\nphase space. The fixed\u2013order perturbative result simply has a smaller phase space, cf.\nEq. (3.4). However, resummation can, and indeed does modify the support properties,\nviolating energy and momentum conservation which hold order by order. In this respect\nit is essential to distinguish between the region targeted by the resummation and other\nphase\u2013space regions:\n\u2022 In the small P + region (or, equivalently, the small hadronic mass region) the resummation11 dramatically improves the description of the differential width, and with\nit the support properties. The resummed perturbative distribution of Eq. (3.19)\nextends to negative r values. In terms of hadronic variables, the differential width\nextends to the region P + < \u039b\u0304 and approximately vanishes for P + < 0 (see Fig. 3),\nconsistently with the physical support properties [31].\n\u2022 Away from the region targeted by the resummation, partonic phase\u2013space boundaries\nare also violated12 . This, however, is an artifact of uncontrolled O(1/n) higher\u2013order\nperturbative corrections, which depend on the specific scheme by which matching\nto the fixed\u2013order result is done. As shown in Fig. 3 the phase\u2013space limit r <\n(1 \u2212 x)/\u03bb (see Eq. (3.4)) is violated. Fortunately, this makes just a small impact on\nthe observables we consider. This issue is discussed further in Sec. 4.2.\nConsidering other phase\u2013space limits of x = 2El /mb or \u03bb = (P \u2212 \u2212 \u039b\u0304)/mb that are\nnot related to the resummation variable r, the partonic phase\u2013space limits of Eq. (3.4) are\nunmodified by the resummation. The phase space after the P + integration is shown in\nFig. 4, where we indicate both the hadronic and the partonic upper limits13 on the charged\nlepton energy.\nAs explained below, the transformation of the resummed distribution in the small\nlightcone component from partonic to hadronic variables has a crucial role in obtaining a\n11\n\nNote that we refer here specifically to DGE where renormalons are regulated by the Principal Value\nprescription. This improvement is not achieved in fixed\u2013logarithmic\u2013accuracy Sudakov resummation, see\ne.g. Fig. 1, which suffers from Landau singularities.\n12\nViolation of the hard phase\u2013space boundary by resummed distributions is a familiar phenomenon, see\ne.g. Ref. [38]\n13\nNote that although we shall refer below to the hadronic phase space, El \u2264 MB /2, the numerical\nintegration is actually done in the range El \u2264 mb /2, as dictated by the perturbative support properties.\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\f\u039b\n\n0.3\n\n-\n\n1/\u03930d\u0393/dP +dP dEl [GeV -3]\n\n0.35\n\n0.25\nNNLL-DGE:\nEl=1.0 GeV\nEl=1.5 GeV\nEl=2.0 GeV\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n0.1\n\n-\n\nP =3.5 GeV\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n+\nP [GeV]\n\nFigure 3: The fully differential width (in units of \u03930 ) computed based on Eq.

The maximal P + endpoint (MB \u2212 2El ), denoted by a vertical line, should\nbe: 3.3, 2.3 and 1.3 GeV, respectively. The u = 3/2 renormalon residue parameter in Eq. (3.27) (see\nFig. 2) is C = 1. Note that the perturbative support properties, namely \u039b\u0304 < P + < MB \u2212 2El are\nviolated at both ends. At the low P + end this is of course a desired consequence of the resummation:\nthe physical support properties P + > 0 are approximately recovered. At the high P + end this is\nan O(\u03b12s /n) artifact, which is non-negligible only for large El .\n\ncorrect, unambiguous result (which is also characterized by approximate physical support\nproperties).\nTo this end, let us recall some of the observations of Refs. [30,39] and reformulate them\nin the context of the semileptonic decay. The first observation, already discussed above,\nis that renormalons in the soft function of Eq. (3.20) have residues proportional to inverse\ninteger powers of the soft scale, indicating potential non-perturbative power corrections\nof the form (n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))j , where j is a positive integer. It was also observed there that\nthe dominant part of these corrections should be attributed to kinematic effects associated\nwith the mass difference between the meson and the quark, \u039b\u0304 = MB \u2212 mb . In the present\n\u2212\ncontext these correspond to identifying r \u2261 p+\nj /pj = \u03c1/\u03bb in terms of hadronic variables\nusing Eq. (4.1):\nr=\n\nP + \u2212 \u039b\u0304\n,\nP \u2212 \u2212 \u039b\u0304\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhich effectively shifts the distribution in r by \u039b\u0304/(\u03bbmb ). Note that Eq. (4.1) relies on the\nassumption that the b quark is on-shell, so this transformation is purely kinematic and\nthe \"primordial\" motion of the b quark in the meson is not taken into account. In order\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 4: The full phase space in the (P \u2212 , El ) plain (upper left triangle) after the P + integration\n\u2212\nhas been performed. The dotted horizontal line El = mb /2 starting at PH\n= \u039b\u0304 is the upper\nboundary of the partonic phase space. A lower cut on the charged lepton energy (here El >\nE0 = 1 GeV) removes the small triangular region below the horizontal dashed line. An upper\n2\ncut on the hadronic invariant mass (here P + P \u2212 < MX\n= (1.7 GeV)2 ) affects the distribution for\n1\n2\n\u2212\nEl < 2 (MB \u2212 MX /P ). A full line separates between this region and the rest of the phase space\nwhere this cut is irrelevant. On this line we denoted three special points by D (P \u2212 = MX ), C\n(P \u2212 = MB \u2212 2E0 ) and F (P \u2212 = MB ), respectively.\n\nto account for such non-perturbative dynamics, additional power corrections of the form\n(n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))j with j \u2265 2 should be included, as discussed below.\nStill within the on-shell heavy\u2013quark approximation, converting Eq.

The \u039b\u0304 dependence associated with the shift\nin P + factorizes exactly in these variables.

Obviously, it makes\ncorrection factor 1 \u2212 \u039b\u0304/P \u2212\nno impact of the first moment and it becomes increasingly important as n gets large.\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fIt was further shown14 in Ref.

The exponentiation of the corresponding\npower\u2013like ambiguity in Eq. (3.20) and the regularization of \u039b\u0304 and of the Sudakov exponent\nusing the same prescription are crucial for this cancellation to take place. In the Principal\nValue prescription the numerical result for \u039b\u0304 is\n\u039b\u0304 \u2261 \u039b\u0304PV \u2261 MB \u2212 mPV\nb = 5.28 \u2212 4.88 \u00b1 0.06 GeV = 0.40 \u00b1 0.06 GeV,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere we used the result for the mass ratio in Eq. (2.4) with the short\u2013distance quark mass\nvalue of Eq. (2.11) and Nf = 4.\nLet us address now power corrections associated with the dynamical structure of the\nmeson. The perturbative calculation of the soft Sudakov exponent accounts for radiation off\nthe heavy quark that puts it slightly off its mass shell. However, it cannot take into account\nthe way in which the virtuality of the heavy quark is influenced by its non-perturbative\ninteraction with the light degrees of freedom in the meson. As discussed in Refs. [30,31], in\nthe present framework such non-perturbative dynamics is reflected in additional power corrections of form (n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))j with j \u2265 2. The detailed structure of these power corrections\ncan be read off from the renormalon ambiguities of the soft Sudakov exponent. As done\nexplicitly in Eq. (3.48) each power ambiguity is associated with a new non-perturbative\nparameter fjPV ; upon including the power term, the corresponding ambiguity is removed.\nThe multiplicative correction to the Sudakov factor in Eq. (3.48) translates directly into a\nmultiplicative correction to partonic moments computed, for example, in Eq. (3.45). Given\nthe kinematic cancellation of the leading (u = 1/2) renormalon ambiguity discussed above,\nand given that BS (u = 1) vanishes (see Eq. (3.27) and the discussion following it), the leading dynamical power correction is associated with the u = 3/2 ambiguity, corresponding\nto j = 3. This correction would modify the spectral moments by\nd\u0393n (\u03bb, x)\nd\u0393n (\u03bb, x)\n\u2212\u2192\n\u00d7\n(4.7)\nd\u03bbdx PV\nd\u03bbdx PV\n(\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 !)\n\u039b 4\n\u039b 3 PV CF T (3/2)\nf3 \u03c0\n,\nBS (3/2)R(n, 3/2) + O\nexp\nmb \u03bb\n\u03b20 3/2\nmb \u03bb\n1\nwhere R(n, 3/2) = 12\n(n \u2212 3)(n \u2212 2)(n \u2212 1). Note that unless the residue of the anomalous\ndimension BS (3/2) and the non-perturbative coefficient f3PV are much larger than one,\nwhich we consider unlikely, Eq. (4.7) amounts to a small correction even for n \u223c \u03bbmb /\u039b.\nThe corrections of Eq. (4.7) go beyond our minimal model: here we regularize all\nthe renormalons using the Principal Value prescription and do not include any additional\n14\n\nThe cancellation has been explicitly checked by a calculation in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit and argued to be\ngeneral.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fnon-perturbative power terms (i.e. we set fjPV = 0 for j \u2265 3). The resulting, essentially\nperturbative, spectrum of Eq. (4.4) may therefore differ from the measured spectrum by\neffects of the from of Eq. (4.7); because of the parametrically small contribution to moments\n+\nn<\n\u223c \u03bbmb /\u039b, these effects are restricted to a narrow region near P \u2243 0. We shall revisit\nthis issue in Sec. 4.2 below when estimating the related theoretical uncertainty.\nIn Appendix D we explicitly show how the resummed result for the spectrum, computed\nin the previous section using moments of the partonic lightcone momentum ratio r = \u03c1/\u03bb,\nis used to compute the partial branching fraction with experimentally\u2013relevant cuts. In\nSec. D.1 we use the results of Sections 3.3 and 3.4 to express the partially integrated\nwidth with a cut on MX (or on P + ) and an additional mild cut on the lepton energy. In\nSec. D.2 we derive expressions for the same observables using the results of Sec. 3.5 and\nAppendix C, where the cut on the lepton energy is implemented analytically. Numerical\nresults for Rcut as a function on MX or P + are presented in Sec. 4.2, where we also perform\na detailed study of the theoretical uncertainty. Finally, in Sec. 4.3 we extract |Vub | from\nrecent measurements by Belle.\n4.2 Numerical results and theoretical uncertainty estimates\nIn extracting |Vub | from experimental data according to Eq. (1.2) the effect of kinematic\ncuts is taken into account through the event fraction Rcut defined in Eq. (1.1). Here\nwe shall use15 the tools of the previous sections to evaluate Rcut for hadronic mass MX or\nlightcone momentum P + cuts (with additional lower cut on El ) and estimate the theoretical\nuncertainties involved.\nIt should be emphasized that although the formulae in Sections D.1 and D.2 are explicitly written for partial rates and are normalized by \u03930 , we are really dealing here with\nthe perturbative expansion of Rcut , not the partial width and the full width separately.\nA single calculation of Rcut in Eq. (1.1) involves using these formulae twice: with a cut\nin the numerator, and with no cut in the denominator. Clearly, \u03930 cancels in the ratio.\nThis has far\u2013reaching implications in what concerns renormalization\u2013scale dependence and\nrenormalon ambiguities: Rcut , in contrast with the partial (or total) rate in units of \u03930 , is\nnot affected by the O(\u039b/mb ) renormalon ambiguity. This ambiguity would have cancelled\nwith the ambiguity of m5b in \u03930 had this factor been included and the series resummed. In\nRcut it simply cancels16 between the numerator and the denominator.\nAs already mentioned, we focus on the cut that maximizes the rate, as measured by\n2 = (1.7 GeV)2 to discriminate the charm background with an\nBelle [7]: P + P \u2212 < MX\nadditional lepton\u2013energy cut El > E0 = 1 GeV. Numerical integration of the differential distribution with respect to P \u2212 and El , Eq. (D.2), over the available phase space\nyields Rcut (MX = 1.7 GeV, E0 = 1 GeV) = 0.615. This event fraction will be used in the\nnext section to extract |Vub | from Belle data. In this calculation we used the matching\nof Eq. (3.45) where the renormalization scale for the coupling was set as \u03bc = P \u2212 . In the\n15\n\nNumerical analysis is done using a C program that combines Borel integration, Mellin inversion and\nphase\u2013space integration [64].\n16\nNote, however, that cut\u2013related renormalon ambiguities, which are parametrically enhanced at large n,\nare not canceled in this way; these are discussed below.\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fsoft Sudakov exponent we chose C = 1. In the following we perform a detailed study\nof the theoretical uncertainty in Rcut . We consider uncertainties from three sources: (1)\nhigher\u2013order perturbative corrections going beyond the resummation as well as beyond the\nNLO; (2) renormalons and power corrections, where the main uncertainty is associate with\nparametrically\u2013enhanced power terms related to the quark distribution in the meson; (3)\nMS\nuncertainty in the values of fundamental short\u2013distance parameters: \u03b1MS\ns and mb .\nMatching schemes, scale dependence and higher\u2013order perturbative effects\nThe resummation employed here focuses on improving the perturbative expansion of the\nfully differential width in the particular kinematic region where one lightcone component of\nthe hadronic system, P + , is small. Matching has been performed to the full NLO expression. Our purpose here is to estimate the effect of higher\u2013order perturbative corrections\non Rcut . This is done in two ways: first by comparing different matching schemes introduced in sections 3.3 through 3.5, and then by renormalization\u2013scale variation in the\nmatching coefficient.\nLet us first estimate the numerical significance of the difference between different\nmatching schemes, which are formally of O(\u03b12s /n). Fig. 5 shows the result of three differ2 as a\nent calculations of the event fraction Rcut with a hadronic mass cut P + P \u2212 < MX\nfunction of MX , with a fixed lepton\u2013energy cut El > 1 GeV, all with the same choice of\nrenormalization scale for the coupling in the matching coefficient, \u03bc = P \u2212 (see below):\n(a) Using the partially integrated distribution with respect to El , namely Eq. (D.11) and\nEq. (3.53).\n(b) Using the differential distribution with respect to El , Eq. (D.2) (or, equivalently, Eqs.\n(D.4) through (D.6)) with the matching of Eq. (3.45).\n(c) same as (b) with the matching of Eq. (3.40).\nThe origin of the difference between (c) and (b) is clear: the constant terms, which were\ntreated in Eq. (3.40) as part of the matching coefficient are exponentiated in Eq. (3.45). Less\nobvious is the difference between (a) and (b), which is reflected also in the P \u2212 distributions\nplotted in Fig. 6. Let us explain this difference for the example where an MX cut is applied.\nThe first crucial observation is that the resummed distribution (Fig. 3) does not respect\nthe phase space limit r < (1 \u2212 x)/\u03bb, which holds order by order in perturbation theory.\nInstead, the distribution develops a tail that extends up to r = 1. By construction, the first\nmoment, which is determined by the matching coefficient (i.e. the fixed\u2013order result) alone,\nis unaffected by this tail. In contrast, whenever one uses the distribution computed as an\ninverse\u2013Mellin of the resummed moment\u2013space expression these details become important.\nConsidering next the way the phase space in Fig. 4 is covered we see that in case (a)\nonly the region P \u2212 < MX is evaluated using the first moment whereas the entire region\nP \u2212 > MX is reconstructed as an inverse Mellin transform of the resummed expression.\nIn case (b) the differential distribution is used only where necessary: the entire region\n2 /P \u2212 ) is computed using the first moment and only the\nabove the line El > 12 (MB \u2212 MX\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fEvent Fraction\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\nNNLL-DGE:\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\nE0=1GeV\n\n0.4\n\n-\n\n\u03bc=P\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\nMX [GeV]\n\n2\nFigure 5: The event fraction Rcut within the range P + P \u2212 < MX\nand El > 1 GeV, plotted\nas a function of the cut value MX .

In each of the two last cases, two different calculation\nprocedures are used in order to gauge the sensitivity to higher\u2013order corrections (matching\u2013scheme\ndependence): (a) using the partially integrated distribution with respect to El , namely Eq. (D.11)\nand Eq. (3.53) and (b) numerically integrating over the differential distribution with respect to El ,\nEq. (D.2) and Eq. (3.45).

When considering the partial width with stringent cuts, Sudakov resummation is essential. As shown in Refs. [30,31]\nand Sec. 3.2 above, the logarithmic accuracy criterion fails because of large running\u2013coupling\neffects. By using DGE we resum these effects as well. However, this resummation is restricted to the Sudakov exponent. A priori, one might worry that additional resummation\nof running\u2013coupling effects should be applied in the matching coefficient as well. Using\nscale variation we show below that this resummation is probably not necessary for the\ncalculation of Rcut at the \u00b15% level.\nWhen considering Rcut with very mild cuts Sudakov resummation is irrelevant. But\nrunning\u2013coupling effects, which we have not resummed, may still be significant. It is\nimportant to emphasize, that these effects cannot be estimated using the expansion of the\ntotal width17 , Eq. (2.1), which in contrast with Rcut , is affected by the infrared renormalon\n17\n\nIndeed, the BLM scale of the total width is of order \u039b, see e.g. [56].\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\fEvent Fraction\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\nNNLL-DGE:\n\u03bc=P\n\u03bc=mpole\nb\n\u03bc=mpole/2\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\nb\n\nE0=1GeV\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\nMX [GeV]\n\n2\nFigure 7: The event fraction Rcut within the range P + P \u2212 < MX\nand El > 1 GeV, computed\nusing Eq. (D.11) and Eq. (3.53), plotted as a function of the cut value MX . Different assignments\nfor the argument of the coupling in the matching coefficient are used.\n\ncorresponding to m5b . Determination of the BLM scale in Rcut requires the knowledge of\nthe matching coefficients of Sec. 3.3 as a function of \u03bb and x to O(\u03b12s \u03b20 ). These calculations\nhave not yet been performed.\nWe therefore resort to estimating running\u2013coupling effects in the matching coefficients\nby means of scale variation. A natural scale for the coupling in the matching coefficient is\nP \u2212 , which is the hard scale characterizing the hadronic system. \u03bc = P \u2212 will be our default\nvalue. Clearly, as good an alternative would be the partonic p\u2212\nj - this scale appear as the\nhard scale in Sudakov exponent, see e.g. Eq. (3.20) or Eq. (3.24).\nFig. 7 presents the result for the event fraction Rcut associated with a hadronic mass\n2 as a function of M\ncut P + P \u2212 < MX\nX with a fixed lepton\u2013energy cut El > 1 GeV,\ncomputed according to Eq. (D.11) and Eq. (3.53), with three different assignments of the\nrenormalization scale \u03bc in \u03b1MS\ns (\u03bc) in both the virtual and real\u2013emission contributions to\n2 = (1.7 GeV)2 (and E > 1 GeV) are\nthe matching coefficient. The results for P + P \u2212 < MX\nl\nalso summarized in Table 2. We find that while the coupling varies from \u03b1s (mb ) \u2243 0.22 to\n\u03b1s (mb /2) \u2243 0.29, i.e. by over 32%, Rcut varies only by about 8.3%.\nLet us consider now the default choice of \u03bc = P \u2212 . As shown in Fig. 6 the P \u2212\ndistribution in which no MX (or P + ) cuts are applied is peaked close to P \u2212 \u2243 MB . On\nthe other hand the MX cut suppresses the distribution at the hard\u2013P \u2212 end, while it makes\nno impact on the soft end. Therefore, the choice of matching\u2013coefficient scale as \u03bc = P \u2212\nis a priori quite different from \u03bc = mb . Nevertheless, as shown in Table 2 the overall effect\n2 = (1.7 GeV)2 (and E > 1 GeV) is just \u223c 3.9%.\nof this change on Rcut for P + P \u2212 < MX\nl\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\fscale of \u03b1s\n\u03bc = P\u2212\n\u03bc = mb\n\u03bc = mb /2\n\nEvent Fraction Rcut (MX = 1.7 GeV, E0 = 1 GeV)\n0.5941\n0.6173\n0.5677\n\nvariation (%)\ndefault\n+3.9\n\u22124.4\n\n2\nTable 2: Results of the event fraction within the range P + P \u2212 < MX\n= (1.7 GeV)2 and El > E0 =\n1 GeV using Eq. (D.11) and Eq. (3.53) with different assignments for the scale of the coupling in\nthe matching coefficient (the n = 1 moment).\n\nTaking into account the scale uncertainty as \u00b14.4% and combining it in quadrature18\nwith the matching scheme dependence estimate of \u00b13.5%, we assign a total theoretical\nuncertainty of 5.6% in Rcut for MX = 1.7 GeV owing to unknown higher\u2013order corrections.\nWe expect these number would significantly reduce once NNLO calculations of the fully\ndifferential width would be completed.\nRenormalons and power corrections\nConsidering the leading, u = 1/2 renormalon ambiguity, it is essential to distinguish between\n\u2022 the O(\u039b/mb ) renormalon in the total width when written in units of \u03930 (or the n = 1\nmoment of the matching coefficient) which cancels by defining Rcut as we did, and\n\u2022 the cut\u2013related leading O((n \u2212 1)\u039b/mb ) renormalon in the Sudakov exponent which\nmakes all the perturbative moments (but n = 1) ambiguous and generates an ambiguous shift of the normalized distribution.\nWhile the former is canceled in Rcut by definition, the latter affects only the partial width\n(i.e. the numerator in Rcut ) and becomes more significant the deeper the cut is. As\ndiscussed in detail in Sec. 4.1, its cancellation [30, 31] requires renormalon resummation\nin the Sudakov exponent and incorporating the corresponding kinematic power corrections\n\u0001n\u22121\naccording to Eq. (4.4). Having full control of the u = 1/2 renormalon,\n1 \u2212 \u039b\u0304/P \u2212\nincluding the normalization of its residue, and having defined both the Sudakov factor and\n\u039b\u0304 using the Principal Value prescription, the computed spectrum is free of any O(\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))\nartifact of the non-physical on-shell heavy\u2013quark state.\nBeyond the u = 1/2 renormalon the Sudakov factor has subleading power corrections\nreflecting the non-perturbative dynamics of the b quark in the B meson. As discussed\nin Refs. [30,31] and in Sections 3.4 and 4.1 above, these corrections depend on the definition\nof the perturbative sum applied in the Sudakov exponent. Moreover, the perturbative\nSudakov exponent (3.45) as well as the corresponding renormalon ambiguities (4.7) depends\non the magnitude of the Borel function away from the origin, so the assumptions made on\nBS (u) are directly relevant. Let us briefly summarize these assumptions:\n18\n\nBy regarding these two uncertainties as independent we obtain a conservative uncertainty estimate.\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\f(1) We assumed that, as in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit (3.16), the Borel function BS (u) vanishes\nat u = 1 and has no additional zeros. The vanishing of BS (1) implies, in particular,\nthat there is no ambiguity O((n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))2 ) in the exponent so the leading correction,\ncorresponding to the u = 3/2 renormalon ambiguity, takes the form of Eq. (4.7);\n(2) We assumed that BS (u) gets small at large u, although this is not required for the\nconvergence of the Borel integral. To control the contribution from intermediate\nvalues of u, we included in the ansatz for BS (u) in Eq. (3.27) a single free parameter\nC which is proportional to BS (u = 3/2); see Fig. 2 and Eq. (3.29). It is difficult to\ncompute BS (u = 3/2), but numerically large (as well as extremely small) values of C\ncan probably be excluded by the following considerations: (a) for C \u2243 26 the residue\nat u = 3/2 would be as large as in the large\u2013\u03b20 , which is unlikely since non-Abelian\ncorrections tend to reduce renormalon residues; (b) given the ansatz of Eq. (3.29),\neither large or small values of C imply that t1 and t2 become unnaturally large,\nand so do higher\u2013order perturbative corrections to BS (u). Eventually, these can be\ncomputed explicitly to further constrain this function.\nHaving fixed the Borel transform of the anomalous dimensions in Eq. (3.27), we compute\nthe Sudakov exponent of Eq. (3.43) applying the Principal Value prescription to all the\nBorel singularities. The resulting DGE spectrum displays only small sensitivity to C, see\ndiscussion below. Therefore, despite the formal dependence on the regularization prescription for the u = 3/2 and higher renormalons, this resummed spectrum can be directly\nconsidered an approximation to the meson decay spectrum. On the theoretical level, this\nis supported by the following observations [31]:\n\u2022 According to the renormalon ambiguity pattern, the leading correction corresponds\nto the third power of n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ). Eq. (4.7) implies that for not\u2013too\u2013high moments\n(n <\n\u223c \u03bbmb /\u039b) the non-perturbative effect is small, and therefore only a narrow region\nnear P + \u2243 0 is affected.\n\u2022 Despite the finite gap between the physical support properties (P + > 0) and the\nperturbative ones (P + > \u039b\u0304), the resummed perturbative spectrum, quite remarkably,\nhas support that is close to the physical spectrum.\nThe final judgement, however, must be based on comparison with experimental data. Comparing the predictions of Ref. [31], corresponding to C = 1 in Eq. (3.27) above, with experimental data for B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3, shows [41] that this minimal model, which essentially has no\nfree parameters, describes the spectrum well. In particular, the first two central moments\nwith cuts, namely the average energy and the width defined with E\u03b3 > E0 (Eqs. (5.3)\nand (5.4) in Ref. [31]) agree with experiment within error, while for the third moment the\ndata is still statistically limited [12, 13]. It should be emphasized that the theoretical error\nestimate in [31, 41] did not include any variation of BS (u) nor any non-perturbative power\nMS\ncorrections, but only variation of the short\u2013distance parameters \u03b1MS\ns and mb within their\nranges of uncertainty.\n\n\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n\f1/\u03930d\u0393/dP +dP dEl [GeV -3]\n\n0.3\n\n\u039b\n\n-\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\nNNLL-DGE:\nC=0.1\nC=1.0\nC=10.0\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n-\n\nP =3.5 GeV, El=1.5 GeV\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n+\nP [GeV]\n\nFigure 8: The fully differential width (in units of \u03930 ) computed based on Eq.

(3.27) (see Fig. 2).\nC = 1 is the value used in Ref. [31].\n\nGiven the good description of the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 spectrum [41] in the present framework,\nour default choice here is not to include any parametrization of additional non-perturbative\ncorrections of O((n\u039b/(\u03bbmb ))j ) with j \u2265 3. As soon as theoretical predictions and experimental results become sufficiently constraining, parametrization of these corrections along\nthe lines of Eq. (4.7) would be in place.\nWe note that since the size of the leading correction in Eq. (4.7) is controlled by\nthe product of f3PV and BS (3/2) (or, equivalently, C) these two parameters are strongly\ncorrelated. Based on data alone it would therefore not be possible to distinguish between\ngenuine non-perturbative effects in the meson (fjPV ) and unknown higher\u2013order corrections\nto BS (u) that modify its behavior away from the origin with respect to Eq. (3.27). To\ndetermine fjPV , one would need not only very accurate data but also further theoretical\nconstraints.\nLet us therefore proceed by analyzing the numerical consequences of varying BS (u) in\nEq. (3.43) by means of C, while setting fjPV (j \u2265 3) in Eq. (4.7) to zero. Later we shall\nconsider the uncertainty associated with a non-zero f3PV . C influences the width of the\nspectrum as a function of P + , but even more, the left\u2013right asymmetry in the shape. This\ncan be seen in Fig. 8, where it is also obvious that large values of C, such as C = 10, are\ndisfavored as the distribution extends then further into the negative P + domain, violating\nthe physical support properties.\nThe final effect of varying C within the range 0.1 to 10 on Rcut is shown in Fig. 9\n\n\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n\fC\n0.1\n1\n10\n\nEvent Fraction Rcut (MX = 1.7 GeV, E0 = 1 GeV)\n0.5799\n0.5941\n0.5870\n\nvariation (%)\n\u22122.4\ndefault\n\u22121.2\n\nEvent Fraction\n\n2\nTable 3: Results of the event fraction within the range P + P \u2212 < MX\n= (1.7 GeV)2 GeV and\nEl > 1 GeV using Eq.

Results for the experimentally\u2013relevant value of P + P \u2212 < MX\n(1.7 GeV)2 (and El > E0 = 1 GeV) are also summarized in Table 3. We find that varying\nC from 0.1 to 10 the event fraction varies by only 2.4%. Note that the variation is nonmonotonous.\nFinally, let us return to the numerical effect of the leading non-pertrbative correction\nin Eq. (4.7). As discussed above, one expects fjPV to be of O(1). For f3PV = 1 and for our\ndefault value C = 1 the effect is very small. For example, for the experimentally\u2013relevant\n2 = (1.7 GeV)2 the correction to R\ncut value of P + P \u2212 < MX\ncut is \u223c 0.2%; naturally,\n2 =\nthe effect increases significantly when lowering the cut, for example, for P + P \u2212 < MX\n(1.4 GeV)2 it amounts to 1.3%. As obvious from Eq. (4.7), if one assumes C = 10 instead,\nthe corrections are larger.

Given how small the effect from varying f3PV is, and its strong correlation\nwith the variation of C, we do not include it in the overall uncertainty estimate for Rcut .\nParametric Uncertainty\nThe numerical values reported above depend on two short distance parameters, mbMS and\nMS\nPV\n\u03b1MS\ns . Our default values are mb = 4.19 GeV corresponding to a pole mass of mb \u2261 mb =\nMS\n4.88 GeV and \u03b1MS\ns (mZ ) = 0.119 corresponding to \u03b1s (mb ) = 0.217. The number of light\nflavors was set as Nf = 4.\nTo estimate the uncertainty in the computed values of Rcut we repeat the calculation\nwith different assignments of these parameters. The results are summarized in Table 4.\nClearly, the largest parametric uncertainty is related to the value of the quark mass.\n+\nUncertainty estimates for P + < Pmax\ncut\n\nLet us now perform the calculation of Rcut with a cut on the small lightcone component\nP + in addition to a mild cut on the lepton energy (El > 1 GeV). As before, the central\nvalue is obtained by numerical integration of the differential distribution computed using\nEq. (D.1) with the matching of Eq. (3.45) over the relevant P \u2212 and El phase space, where\nthe renormalization scale in the matching coefficient is set to be \u03bc = P \u2212 and C = 1. The\ncentral value computed this way for P + < 0.66 GeV and El > 1 GeV (as in the Belle\nmeasurement [7]) is Rcut = 0.535.\nThe error analysis completely parallels the one applied for the MX cut. We therefore\nbriefly summarize the results.

Conclusions\nWe have presented a calculation of the fully differential distribution in B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 decays\nthat relies only on resummed perturbation theory, and yet describes the meson decay\nspectrum with approximately correct physical support in the small\u2013P + region. What makes\nthis at all feasible is that the leading renormalon divergence of the Sudakov exponent is fully\nunder control; the corresponding ambiguity of the resummed moments, which amounts\nto a global O(\u039b/P \u2212 ) shift, cancels out exactly upon converting to hadronic variables,\na conversion that itself involves the a priori ambiguous pole-mass definition. While a\nregularization (Principal Value) has been arbitrarily chosen at the intermediate stage, the\nend result is unambiguous.\nIn sharp contrast, an attempt to use Sudakov resummation with fixed logarithmic\naccuracy - no matter how high - is bound to fail dramatically due to the unregulated\nrenormalon divergence21 . An example is presented in Figure 13 that compares the DGE\nspectrum at El = 1.5 GeV and P \u2212 = 3.5 GeV to that obtained by standard Sudakov\nresummation with LL, NLL and NNLL accuracy. Obviously, DGE makes a qualitative\ndifference.\nIt should be stressed that the detailed description of the spectrum in the P + \u2013peak\nregion, and especially near the P + = 0 endpoint, is necessarily approximate and it must\nrely on certain assumptions. First of all, there are both perturbative and non-perturbative\ncontributions. Using moments the latter appear as powers of O(n\u039b/P \u2212 ), so they are\nparametrically small at small n, but they gradually become important as n increases.\nUncertainties corresponding to the first and hopefully the second powers of n\u039b/P \u2212 can\nbe avoided - but not the high powers. Towards the small\u2013P + endpoint (P + \u2212\u2192 0) high\nmoments become relevant and the parametric hierarchy is lost. What dictates the details\nof the decay spectrum in this region is the quark distribution in the meson. Physically\none expects that this distribution would differ from the one in an on-shell quark owing to\nthe interaction between the b quark and the light degrees of freedom. It is our working\nassumption that these differences are small and therefore better calculation of the latter\n20\n\nThe values corresponding to the two cuts there are still consistent within errors.\nMoreover, in this case it is not at all obvious which mass should be used in the conversion of the partonic\nspectrum to hadronic variables.\n21\n\n\u2013 45 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 13: The differential (left) and integrated (right) spectrum based on DGE and on the\nfixed\u2013logarithmic\u2013accuracy formula of Eq. (3.26), plotted as a function of P + . All calculations\nare matched to NLO. The LL, NLL and NNLL accuracy results are plotted as dotdashed, dashed\nand full line, respectively. The DGE curve smoothly extends below the partonic phase\u2013space limit,\nfilling up the region 0 < P + < \u039b\u0304. In contrast, the three fixed\u2013logarithmic\u2013accuracy curves end\nabove \u039b\u0304, at the point where the resummed results become complex owing to the Landau singularity.\n\namounts to better description of the former. Eventually the difference between the two\nshould be quantified.\nNon-perturbative contributions aside, computing the on-shell decay spectrum itself\nwithin a given regularization scheme for the renormalons is still an incredible task. In\nRef. [31] and in the present work we made significant progress in this direction. As we saw,\nthe main difficulty is that the Borel sum in Eq. (3.43) is not entirely dominated by the\nperturbative expansion in powers of u; additional information on the behavior of the Borel\nintegrand away from the origin is needed. Since the general structure of the exponent as\na function of n is known, the main uncertainty arises from the soft anomalous dimension\nfunction BS (u). The cancellation of the leading renormalon ambiguity with the pole mass\nallows us to determine BS (u = 1/2) accurately [31]. Based on the known analytic result\nin the large\u2013\u03b20 limit, we further assumed here that BS (u = 1) = 0 and that this function\nhas no other zeros. We then parametrized the contribution from the region BS (u >\n\u223c 3/2)\nto facilitate uncertainty estimates. We found that approximately correct non-perturbative\nsupport properties are recovered in the Principal Value prescription if this contribution is\nindeed small. This is demonstrated in Fig. 8.\nUnder these assumptions we obtained definite predictions for the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 [31]\nand B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 spectra. So far comparison with experimental data has been performed\nfor the first two central moments in B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 with varying cuts, finding very good\nagreement [41]. More detailed comparison of both distributions has a great potential in\ntesting these assumptions and, eventually, in quantifying power corrections.\nThe fully differential B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 spectrum computed here can be used to extract\n|Vub | from any experimental measurement of the partial branching fraction. The resummation employed is specifically designed to improve the determination of the partial rate\n\n\u2013 46 \u2013\n\n\fin the small hadronic mass (or small P + ) region, which is the experimentally\u2013favorable\nway of discriminating charm. By numerically integrating the differential spectrum over the\nrelevant phase space we computed the fraction of events measured for a given experimental cut. Using recent measurements by Belle [7] for the branching fraction in the regions\n2 = (1.7 GeV)2 and P + < P + = 0.66 GeV (with E > 1 GeV), we extracted\nP + P \u2212 < MX\nl\nmax\n|Vub | and analyzed the theoretical uncertainty. The final results are quoted in Eqs. (4.11)\nand (4.15), respectively. We find that\n\u2022 The most important source of uncertainty is the value of the b quark mass. It\ndirectly influences both the calculation of the total rate and that of the event fraction\nassociated with the cut. Better determination of the mass will therefore translate\ndirectly into better measurement of |Vub |. One natural possibility for the b quark\nmass measurement is to make use of recent data on the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 spectrum [12, 13]\ntogether with calculated spectrum [31].\n\u2022 Another important source of uncertainty is higher\u2013order perturbative corrections.\nNNLO calculation of the fully differential B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 is not beyond reach. When\navailable, it can be readily matched to the resummed spectrum. This will significantly reduce the matching scheme dependence as well as the renormalization scale\ndependence in the matching coefficient.\n\u2022 Finally, under the assumptions discussed above, the uncertainty associated with the\ndetailed shape of the quark distribution function is found to be quite small. This is\nmost striking in the MX cut, see Fig. 9 and Table 3.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Andrea Banfi for very useful discussions.

Similarly, the partially integrated width with a cut\n+ can be computed by\nP + < Pmax\n+ , P \u2212, E )\n1 d\u0393(P + < Pmax\n2\nl\n= 2\n\u2212\n\u03930\ndP dEl\nmb\n\nZ\n\n\u0013n\u22121\n\u0012\ndn\n\u039b\u0304\n\u00d7\n1\u2212 \u2212\nP\nc\u2212i\u221e 2\u03c0i(n \u2212 1)\n\u2212\n\u0012\n+ \u00131\u2212n d\u0393n (\u03bb = P \u2212\u039b\u0304 , x =\nPmax\nmb\n1\u2212 \u2212\nP\nd\u03bbdx\nc+i\u221e\n\n(D.1)\n2El\nmb )\n\n.\n\nThis relation is useful in computing partially integrated widths with a variety of experimental cuts by performing integration over El and P \u2212 as well as the inverse Mellin transform\nand the Principal Values Borel integration numerically.\nThe expression for the width with a cut on the invariant mass, in addition to a cut on\nthe lepton energy, takes the form:\nZ MB\nZ MB /2\n2 ,E > E )\n\u0393(P + P \u2212 < MX\n0\nl\ndP \u2212\ndEl \u03b8(El > E0 )\n=\n\u03930\n0\nMB \u22122El\n\u0014\n+ < M \u2212 2E , P \u2212 , E )\n1\nd\u0393(P\nB\nl\nl\n2\n\u03b8(MB \u2212 2El < MX\n/P \u2212 )\n\u03930\ndP \u2212 dEl\n2 /P \u2212 , P \u2212 , E ) \u0015\n1 d\u0393(P + < MX\nl\n2\n\u2212\n,\n+\u03b8(MX /P < MB \u2212 2El )\n\u03930\ndP \u2212 dEl\n\n(D.2)\n\n+\nis set by the external invariant mass\nso Eq.
