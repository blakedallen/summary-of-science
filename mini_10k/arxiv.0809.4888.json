Introduction\nModel building of a strongly interacting electroweak sector, with or without a Higgs resonance,\nrequires the knowledge of the phase diagram of non-abelian gauge theories for varying number of\ncolors Nc , number of fermion flavors N f , and representation R. For fixed Nc and R the theory is\ngenerically in the chiral symmetry broken phase for low N f and the conformal phase for high N f\nas long as asymptotic freedom is maintained, i.e. N f is not too high. Certain models require N f to\nbe just below the conformal window along the lines of the walking technicolor paradigm [1] and\nthe knowledge of the critical N f separating the two phases is essential.\nMapping out the phase diagram in the space of Nc , N f and R is an interesting problem on its\nown and can be useful for model builders with different motivations such as unparticles. We are\nfirst and foremost concerned with the Higgs mechanism though.\nIn this context the parameters Nc , N f and R are not only restricted by the phase diagram but also\nby electroweak precision data and the symmetry breaking pattern necessary for generating masses\nfor the W and Z bosons. Consistency with electroweak precision data requires a small S-parameter\nwhile the simplest symmetry breaking pattern is the one which generates exactly 3 Goldstone\nbosons with no (techni)pions left over after the massive gauge bosons acquired their masses. The\nsimplest model fulfilling these requirements is SU (3) gauge group with N f = 2 fermions in the\n2-index symmetric (2S) representation which is the topic of our study.\nIn a numerical simulation at finite volume, finite lattice spacing and (usually) finite quark\nmasses it is a non-trivial task to determine whether the theory is conformal in the continuum,\nmassless quark and infinite volume limits, or chiral symmetry is broken just as in QCD. In section\n3 a method is introduced that is capable of distinguishing the two phases based on the behavior of\nthe low-lying Dirac eigenvalues. If the theory is QCD-like chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken\nand random matrix theory (RMT) will predict the distribution of low-lying eigenvalues in the \u03b5 regime [2], whereas in the conformal phase chiral symmetry is unbroken and the spectral density\nof the Dirac operator goes to zero around \u03bb = 0. One particular advantage of RMT is that it works\nfor finite (but small of course) quark mass. This method of distinguishing phases with the help of\nthe Dirac spectrum has been applied for dynamical staggered fermions in [3] which complements\nSchrodinger functional and finite temperature based investigations of similar dynamical staggered\nmodels [4, 5].\n\n2. Perturbative expectations\nAs is well-known the 2-loop perturbative \u03b2 -function [6] can be used to estimate the critical\nN f value above which the theory is conformal and below which chiral symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken [7]. If the first two coefficients are \u03b21 and \u03b22 , asymptotic freedom requires \u03b21 < 0 otherwise\nthe theory is free in the continuum. If \u03b21 < 0 and \u03b22 > 0 a non-trivial zero of the \u03b2 -function exists\nhinting at a non-trivial IR fixed point. However if the fixed point value of the coupling is too large\nchiral symmetry is spontaneously broken before the flow in the IR can reach the would-be fixed\npoint. It is nevertheless expected that a critical N crit\nvalue exists above which the theory is really\nf\nconformal even non-perturbatively.\n2\n\n\fNearly conformal electroweak sector with chiral fermions\n\nD\u00e1niel N\u00f3gr\u00e1di\n\nThe value N crit\ncan be estimated in the ladder approximation by the requirement that the\nf\nanomalous dimension of \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 reaches \u03b3 = 1 [8]. Using this bound, the conformal window for\nSU (2) and representations j = 1/2, 1 and 3/2 is expected to be 8 < N f < 11, none (for integer N f )\nand N f = 1 respectively, and no window for j > 3/2. For SU (3) and fundamental, adjoint = 2A\nand 2S representations the conformal window is expected to be 12 < N f < 16, none (for integer\nN f ) and N f = 3 respectively.\n\n3. Dirac spectrum\nTo what extent the perturbative expectations of the previous section are justified is an open\nquestion in general. Non-perturbative tests of these expectations have been performed for various\ngauge groups, flavor number and representations [4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] using various methods.\nThe low-lying spectrum of the Dirac operator is sensitive to the IR dynamics of the theory and\nshows characteristically different behavior in the conformal and QCD-like phases. Its measurement\nis in principle straightforward in a lattice simulation hence it is a good candidate to distinguish the\ntwo phases.\n3.1 Chirally broken phase, \u03b5 -regime, random matrix theory\nIf chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, the Banks-Casher relation connects the spectral\ndensity \u03c1 (\u03bb ) of the Dirac operator around zero to the chiral condensate [14],\n\u03a3 = lim lim\n\nm\u21920 V \u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c0\u03c1 (0)\n.\nV\n\n(3.1)\n\nIt also implies that the low-lying eigenvalues are dense in the sense that the average spacing is\ninversely proportional to the volume,\n\u2206\u03bb =\n\n\u03c0\n.\n\u03a3V\n\n(3.2)\n\nIt has been suggested long ago that if the bare parameters \u03b2 , m are tuned to the \u03b5 -regime, i.e.\nsuch that m\u03c0 < L\u22121 < f\u03c0 the low-lying Dirac spectrum follows the predictions of a random matrix\ntheory [15, 16]. The corresponding random matrix model is only sensitive to the pattern of chiral\nsymmetry breaking, the topological charge and the rescaled fermion mass once the eigenvalues are\nalso rescaled by the same factor \u03a3V .\nMore precisely, random matrix theory provides analytic formulae for the microscopic spectral\ndensity\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221e\n\u03b6\n1\n= \u2211 pk (\u03b6 ) ,\n\u03c1S (\u03b6 ) =\n\u03c1\n(3.3)\n\u03a3V\n\u03a3V\nk=0\nand the individual eigenvalue distributions pk (\u03b6 ) where \u03b6 = \u03bb \u03a3V . The distributions pk (\u03b6 ) only\ndepend on \u03bc = m\u03a3V , N f and the topological charge \u03bd . The value of \u03a3 can be obtained by using \u03bc\nas the fitting parameter to have\nh\u03b6k i h\u03bbk i\n,\n=\n\u03bc\nm\n3\n\n(3.4)\n\n\fNearly conformal electroweak sector with chiral fermions\n\nD\u00e1niel N\u00f3gr\u00e1di\n\nwhere the left hand side is calculated in random matrix theory at a fixed charge \u03bd while the right\nhand side is measured in the simulation in the given sector \u03bd . Which eigenvalue \u03bbk and which\nsector \u03bd is used is arbitrary in principle (as long as k is not too large, say, k = 1, 2, 3) and the quality\nof the whole procedure may be characterized by the (in)consistency of the obtained \u03a3 = \u03bc /(mV )\nvalues for various k and/or \u03bd .\nA more stringent test is the comparison of pk (\u03b6 ) between the random matrix theory predictions\nand the simulation once a consistent \u03a3 and corresponding \u03bc have been obtained from the above\nfitting procedure. The agreement is only expected for the first few eigenvalues.\nIn order to see the effects of dynamical quarks the lowest eigenvalue should be larger than the\nfermion mass m. Otherwise the simulation is effectively quenched and random matrix theory will\nonly agree at N f = 0.\nOut of the two requirements of the \u03b5 -regime, m\u03c0 L < 1 can be satisfied by tuning the fermion\nmass to a small value at any L. However the second requirement, f\u03c0 L > 1, is largely independent\nof m provided it is small enough and puts a lower bound on L. As the lower edge of the conformal\nwindow is approached from below, f\u03c0 is expected to decrease and eventually will vanish as the\ntheory becomes conformal. Hence the f\u03c0 L > 1 condition will be more and more difficult to satisfy\nand larger and larger lattices will be needed the closer the theory is to the conformal window. As\na result the study of nearly conformal (or walking) technicolor models is very challenging in the\n\u03b5 -regime.\nIt should be noted that the requirement f\u03c0 L > 1 is valid up to numerical constants only. From\nthe behavior of the rotator and Goldstone spectrum of the chiral Lagrangian it can be made more\n\u221a\nprecise as f\u03c0 L > 1/ 2\u03c0 which is the requirement of these two spectra to separate from each other.\nIn fact we will see that in some cases RMT gives a good description even if f\u03c0 L < 1 which is\n\u221a\nprobably due to the above numerical constant 1/ 2\u03c0 = 0.3989... being smaller than 1.\n3.2 Conformal phase\nIn the conformal phase no scale is generated and \u03a3 = 0. The spectral density of the Dirac\noperator around \u03bb \u223c 0 behaves as\n\n\u03c1 (\u03bb ) \u223c \u03bb 3+\u03b3\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor massless quarks in the continuum and at infinite volume. Here \u03b3 is the anomalous dimension of\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 .\nThe exact dependence of \u03b3 on the conformal fixed point coupling g\u2217 is in principle calculable in perturbation theory since g\u2217 is presumably not large (otherwise chiral symmetry would be\nspontaneously broken). Certainly, \u03b3 \u223c g2\u2217 . Of course only a non-perturbative treatment can decide\nwhether there is room for a fixed point coupling which is large enough to be significantly different\nfrom perturbation theory and small enough so that chiral symmetry is not broken.\nHow the (3.5) behavior is modified by finite volume and finite quark mass is an open question\nthat we hope to address in the future. Certainly, in the free g\u2217 = 0 case the average eigenvalue\nspacing is inversely proportional to the linear size L of the box. The characteristic feature that is\nexpected to hold even for a finite g\u2217 > 0 is that the average eigenvalue spacing for small eigenvalues\nis much less dense than in the chirally broken case where it is inversely proportional to the 4-volume\nV ; see (3.2).\n4\n\n\fNearly conformal electroweak sector with chiral fermions\n\nD\u00e1niel N\u00f3gr\u00e1di\n\nIf the volume is too small, the chiral condensate is squeezed out of the box and the theory\nbehaves perturbatively even in the case when chiral symmetry is broken in an infinite volume.\nHence great care is needed not to confuse a small volume chiral symmetry breaking and a (small\nor large volume) conformal theory which is also behaving more-or-less perturbatively.\n\n4. Our model, SU (3) with N f = 2 in 2S representation\nThe simplest example of a model that \u2013 according to the perturbative expectations \u2013 is just\nbelow the conformal window, has a relatively low N f value so that the S-parameter is relatively\nsmall, and has precisely 3 Goldstone bosons is Nc = 3, N f = 2 and R = 2S. This model has been\nstudied in [11, 12, 13] using Wilson fermions on rather small lattices and it was found to be already\nin the conformal window although it was indicated that more complicated possibilites are also\nallowed by the data.\nSince exact chiral symmetry is important both for QCD-like and conformal theories we chose\nto use overlap fermions [17]. The simulation has to be carried out at a fixed topological charge.\nThere are two methods available for simulating dynamical overlap fermions at fixed topology.\nOne is the reflection/refraction algorithm [18] but always reflecting on the topological boundary.\nThe other is employing a pair of extra Wilson fermions to suppress exact zero modes thereby\nsuppressing tunnelling between sectors [19]. We used the second method, which is much faster, in\nthis study.\n\n5. Preliminary results\n5.1 Quenched simulations\nIn order to see how well actual simulations agree or disagree with the predictions of random\nmatrix theory (RMT) we have tested the RMT predictions for N f = 0 and overlap valence quarks in\nthe fundamental representation since in the quenched approximation chiral symmetry is guaranteed\nto be broken. This setup is identical to [20] but actual eigenvalue distributions were not presented\nthere. Since valuable information can be gained from these we decided to redo this analysis on 124\nlattices at \u03b2 = 5.8458 which corresponds to a lattice size of L = 1.49 fm. All our parameters were\nthe same as in [20]. In particular we used the Wilson gauge action and an unsmeared overlap operator. Our ensemble consists of 1500 configurations. The results of [20] for expectation value ratios\nh\u03bbi i/h\u03bb j i have been reproduced within 1-sigma precision with occasional 1.2-sigma deviations.\nThe distribution of the kth eigenvalue in various topological sectors |Q| are shown in figure 1\ntogether with the RMT predictions once \u03a3 has been fitted from k = 1 and Q = 0 as described by\n(3.4). Clearly, not only the expectation values h\u03bbi i follow the RMT predictions but also their width.\nThis level of agreement with RMT was not expected since f\u03c0 L < 1 for this ensemble, however as\n\u221a\nindicated in section 3.1 a more accurate requirement of the \u03b5 -regime is f\u03c0 L > 1/ 2\u03c0 which this\nensemble does fulfill.\nA similar comparison for the 2-index symmetric representation in the quenched approximation\nis ongoing. Since RMT is only sensitive to the topological charge, N f , \u03bc and the pattern of chiral\nsymmetry breaking, the same random matrix model is expected to describe this representation as\n5\n\n\fNearly conformal electroweak sector with chiral fermions\n\nQ = 0, k = 1\n\nD\u00e1niel N\u00f3gr\u00e1di\n\nQ = 1, k = 1\n\n0.6\n\nQ = 2, k = 1\n\n0.45\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nQ = 0, k = 2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nQ = 1, k = 2\n\n0.4\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nQ = 2, k = 2\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n6\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10 11\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFigure 1: Rescaled quenched eigenvalue distributions pk (\u03b6 ) in the fundamental representation and N f = 0\nRMT predictions for |Q| = 0, 1, 2 and k = 1, 2\n\nthe one used for the fundamental. Agreement with the same RMT using a different representation\nthan fundamental will be a non-trivial check of its universality.\n5.2 Dynamical simulations\nIn the 2-index symmetric representation three dynamical ensembles were generated on 64 lattices using the tree-level improved Symanzik gauge action at \u03b2 = 4.850, 4.975 and 5.100 and\nN f = 2 flavors of massive quarks with m = 0.05. The negative Wilson mass in the overlap operator\nwas mW = \u22121.3 and 2 levels of stout smearing with smearing parameter \u03c1 = 0.15 have been applied. The topology change suppressing action of [19] was used with mass M = 0.2 for the ghost\nWilson fermions and only the topological sector Q = 0 was sampled. Since chiral symmetry is\npreserved by overlap fermions at finite lattice spacing N f = 2 RMT is applicable. Fitting \u03a3 from\nthe average first eigenvalue as in (3.4) one obtains 0.083(4), 0.084(4) and 0.080(4) in lattice units\nfor the three \u03b2 values respectively.\nThe eigenvalue distributions look qualitatively the same for the three \u03b2 values and the first 3\neigenvalues are plotted in figure 2 for \u03b2 = 4.850 together with the N f = 2 RMT predictions after\nrescaling both the eigenvalues and the quark mass.\nClearly, the RMT predictions are very far from the simulation results, neither the averages nor\nthe widths follow the RMT curves. This may be due to several reasons the most likely of which is\nsmall volume. We have not measured either m\u03c0 or f\u03c0 so it is not clear if the simulation was in the\n\u03b5 -regime at all. Simulations on larger volumes as well as measurements of m\u03c0 and f\u03c0 are ongoing.\nIf the larger volume simulations agree with the above conclusion the 2-index symmetric representation for gauge group SU (3) and N f = 2 is already in the conformal window.\n\n6. Conclusions and outlook\nNeedless to say that the results on the 2-index symmetric representation are preliminary.

A similar conclusion is expected\nfor the quenched 2S representation which will in addition test the universality of RMT. Presently,\nthe result of the 64 dynamical 2S representation simulation are preliminary and the deviation from\nRMT is thought to be due to small volume. Larger volume simulations are ongoing for both the\nquenched and fully dynamical cases.\nAcknowledgements\nD.N. would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with Christian Hoelbling, Tam\u00e1s Kov\u00e1cs\nand K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Szab\u00f3.
