In addition because of the equivalence principle the Unruh effect\nis connected with Hawking radiation [2]. Thus finding experimental evidence of the Unruh\neffect would provide indirect evidence for Hawking radiation. The Unruh temperature of\nthe thermal spectrum measured by a linearly accelerating observer is\nkB T =\n\n~a\n,\n2\u03c0c\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a is the acceleration of the observer and kB is Boltzmann's constant. From (1) it\ncan be seen that this is a small effect for normal accelerations. To get a temperature of\neven 1 K one needs a = 2.4 \u00d7 1020 m/s2 . Generally such large accelerations are hard to\nobtain, especially for linear acceleration. However, for circular motion (e.g. electrons in\nthe storage ring at LEP) it was noticed [3] that one could obtain centripetal accelerations\n\u2248 2.9 \u00d7 1023 m/s2 . Using equation (1) this would correspond to a temperature of \u2248 1200\nK. Such a temperature should lead to detectable consequences and in fact it was claimed\n[3] that this Unruh temperature would lead to the electrons populating the upper energy\nlevel to a greater than expected degree. The electrons in the storage ring were taken to be\nin a magnetic field and thus had two energy levels \u2013 a lower energy level with the electron\nspin anti-aligned with the magnetic field and an upper energy level with the electron spin\naligned with the magnetic field. The effective Unruh temperature of the electrons in the\nstorage ring would be large enough to \"thermally\" excite some percentage of the electrons\ninto a higher energy level. This observed population of the upper energy level by electrons in\nstorage rings is known as the Sokolov-Ternov effect [4] and was also studied in [5\u20139]. There\nare some questions [10] if this is really a confirmation of the Unruh effect.\nOver the years there have been other proposals for experimentally confirming the Hawking/Unruh effect either directly or via analog systems [11\u201314]. A recent review article [15]\ncontains references to further experimental proposals for testing the Unruh effect.\nIn this paper we point out the possibility of a new experimental test of the Unruh effect\nusing the outer electrons of fluorine and oxygen. The electrons in these atoms experience\nlarge centripetal accelerations (O(1023 ) m/s2 ) which are comparable to the centripetal accelerations of the electrons in storage rings studied in [3]. Based on these accelerations the\n2\n\n\fouter electrons of these atoms should experience large effective Unruh temperatures similar\nto those experienced by electrons in storage rings. One argument against the existence of\nthis proposed effect is that unlike the electrons in storage rings, which follow classical paths,\nthe electrons in atoms are in quantum eigenstates and naively can not be said to follow a\nclassical path. However, our contention is that it is the acceleration which is important; that\neven if this acceleration occurs for electrons in a quantum eigenstate it should lead to an\neffective Unruh temperature. To our knowledge there has not been any test to determine if a\nsystem undergoing acceleration at the quantum level experiences an Unruh temperature or\nnot. Even if the effect we propose is not seen, this still gives the interesting conclusion that\nthere is then something fundamentally different about acceleration at the classical versus\nquantum level. One argument in favor of the existence of this effect is that in the path\nintegral approach to quantum mechanics, particles do follow or \"try out\" every possible\npath, with each path weighted by exp[i * Action]. The classical path has the heaviest weight.\nAs paths deviate more from this classical path their weight is less and they contribute less\nto the path integral. Our suggestion is that each path experiences some average acceleration (i.e. a) and associated with this average acceleration there will be an effective Unruh\ntemperature given by\n~a\n,\n(2)\nc\nwhere K is a proportionality constant which depends on nature of the acceleration \u2013 for linear\n\u221a\nacceleration K = 1/2\u03c0 from (1); later we show that for circular acceleration K = 1/2 3\nkB T = K\n\n(9). Since the temperatures from each of these paths can not cancel \u2013 they can only add\nup \u2013 the full path integral version of the Unruh temperature should then be of the form\n(2) with some K of order 1. The next ingredient needed to observe the effective Unruh\ntemperature of (2) is excited energy levels which are close enough to the lowest level. We\npredict that due to this Unruh temperature the pure, ground state with all the electrons in\nthe lowest energy levels will be shifted to a mixed state with some fraction of the electrons\noccupying energy levels close to the lowest energy level. By performing measurements on\nthese atoms and finding a larger than expected population of the low lying excited levels\none could confirm the circular Unruh effect. Note this effect does not change the value of\nthe energy levels as is the case with the Lamb shift where the electrons interact with their\nown quantized electromagnetic field, rather it changes a pure state (the electrons occupying\nonly the lowest energy level in the limit when the ambient, external temperature is zero) to\n3\n\n\fa mixed state (the electrons, to some degree, occupying some nearby energy levels). The\nelectrons in the atoms are interacting with the external, quantized vacuum electromagnetic\nfield and react as if exposed to a heat bath at temperature (2).\n\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF THE UNRUH-DEWITT DETECTOR AND ITS APPLICATION\n\nTO CIRCULAR MOTION\n\nIn this section we make a brief review of an Unruh-DeWitt detector which is a device\nfor measuring the excitation spectrum and temperature of a given space-time or spacetime trajectory. We also provide some mathematical details about why the path integral\nformulation of quantum mechanics justifies the application of the Unruh-DeWitt detector\nformalism to atomic electrons which are following \"quantum\" paths.\nAn Unruh-DeWitt detector is a quantum system with two energy levels, E0 < E, with\nE0 being the low level. By placing an Unruh-DeWitt detector in some given space-time\nor allowing it to follow some space-time trajectory one can determine if the space-time or\nspace-time trajectory creates \"photons\" with respect to the detector by seeing if the upper\nenergy level, E, is excited. By measuring the rate at which the upper level is excited one can\nextract a spectrum and effective temperature for the space-time or space-time trajectory.\nFollowing references [8] [16] (which give more complete details of the construction of an\nUnruh-DeWitt detector) we assume our quantum, two-level system is coupled to a scalar\nfield, \u03c6(x\u03bc (\u03c4 )) via a coupling g\u03bc(\u03c4 )\u03c6(x\u03bc (\u03c4 )). Here g is a coupling constant, \u03bc(\u03c4 ) is the\ndetector's monopole moment, and x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) is the detector's trajectory as a function of its\nproper time, \u03c4 . Our \"photons\" will be quanta of the scalar field. Nothing is lost by this but\none does not have to carry around the Lorentz indices associated with a vector field quanta\nlike a real photon. The transition rate per unit proper time, T (E), for this Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector to be excited from the low energy E0 to the high energy E is\nZ +\u221e\nX\n2\n2\n|hE|\u03bc(0)|E0i|\ne\u2212i(E\u2212E0 )\u2206\u03c4 G+ (\u2206\u03c4 )d(\u2206\u03c4 )\nT (E) = g\n\u2212\u221e\n\nE\n\n= g2\n\nX\nE\n\n|hE|\u03bc(0)|E0i|2 F (E) .\n\n(3)\n\nHere we have set c = 1. G+ (x, x\u2032 ) = h0|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0i is the positive frequency Wightman\nfunction since we are interested in excitations from E0 to E rather than de-excitations from\nE to E0 . Finally \u2206\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 is the difference in proper times. In (3) the part that is\n4\n\n\findependent of the details of the detector (i.e. the coupling g, the values of the energy levels\nE0 , E) is called the response function per unit proper time. The response function is [16]\nZ +\u221e\nF (E) =\ne\u2212i(E\u2212E0 )\u2206\u03c4 G+ (\u2206\u03c4 )d(\u2206\u03c4 ).\n(4)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe information about which particular space-time or space-time trajectory one is dealing\nwith is embedded in G+ (x, x\u2032 ). For a detector undergoing constant, linear acceleration a the\n\u0001\nspace-time trajectory is x(\u03c4 ) = a1 sinh (a \u03c4 ) , a1 cosh (a \u03c4 ) , 0, 0 and the Wightman function\nfor linear acceleration is\n\nG+\nlinear (\u2206\u03c4 ) \u221d\n\nsinh2\n\na\n2\n\na2\n\u0001 .\n(\u2206\u03c4 \u2212 i\u01eb)\n\nThis Wightman function for linear acceleration leads to the response function\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u22121\n2\u03c0\u2206E\nFlinear (E) \u221d 1 \u2212 exp\n,\na~\nwhere \u2206E = E \u2212 E0 .\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nOne can see that this response function is Planckian and\n\none can extract the temperature Tlinear = a~/2\u03c0kB .\n\nOf more relevance to classi-\n\ncal \"electrons\" orbiting an atomic nucleus is circular motion with a trajectory x(\u03c4 ) =\np\n(\u03b3\u03c4, R cos (\u03b3 \u03c90 \u03c4 ) , R sin (\u03b3 \u03c90 \u03c4 ) , 0), where \u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 R2 \u03c902 is the usual gamma factor, R is the radius of the orbit and \u03c90 is the angular velocity.

If one expands\n\n2\nG+\nlinear in a similar way one finds that up to O(a ) the Wightman functions for linear and\n2\ncircular motion are the same. In the relativistic limit [3, 8] one can take G+\ncircular to O(a ).\n\nUsing this approximation of G+\ncircular in (4) gives the following response function\n\u221a\n\nFcircular (E) \u221d a e\u22122\n\n3\n\n\u2206E\n~a\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nAlthough this is not a Planckian response function one can define an effective temperature\nfrom the exponent as\n~a\nkB Tc \u2248 \u221a .\n2 3c\n5\n\n(9)\n\n\fUnlike the case of linear acceleration it is not possible to find an analytic, closed form\nexpression for Fcircular (E). The circular response function has been studied numerically\n[17] [18] and these studies show that the circular response function although not exactly\nPlanckian has a Planckian-like form with an effective temperature given by (9).\nIn the following section we want to apply the above analysis to atomic electrons. To\nthis end we should give some justification for applying the results of a quantum two-level\nUnruh-DeWitt detector moving along a classical path to an electron in an atomic orbital.\nThe problem does not occur in replacing the Unruh-DeWitt detector by an electron since\nboth are quantum systems and in fact the electron, because of its spin, is a very good\nphysical model for an Unruh-DeWitt detector as demonstrated in [3, 8, 9]. The problem\noccurs in using a classical path to approximate an electron in a stationary state orbital.\nThe justification for this approximation comes from the path integral approach to quantum\nmechanics where the motion of an quantum particle is given by the sum over all possible\npaths with each path weighted by exp[i*Action]. The classical path contributes the most, but\nin principle every path makes a contribution, although the more a particular path deviates\nfrom the classical path the less it will contribute. Normally one does not use the path integral\nmethod to solve for quantities like the orbitals of electrons in atoms since this is more easily\naccomplished by more elementary means. However, in [19] the hydrogen atom was solved\nvia the path integral approach. Thus in principle (and in some cases [19] in practice) one\ncan treat electrons moving around the atomic nucleus as moving along all possible paths but\nwith the classical path contributing the most. It is in this sense that we will apply the results\nof an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving in a classical circular path to atomic electrons \u2013 the\nclassical path result is the lowest order approximation to the full path integral result. Note\nthat the temperature of each possible path will be positive definite thus it is not possible\nthat the temperatures of the different paths cancel each other. Each path will contribute\nsome positive temperature to the full path integral so that the expression in (9) will be a\napproximate lower bound to the exact temperature.\n\nIII.\n\nCENTRIFUGAL ACCELERATION IN ATOMS\n\nIn [3] it was the centripetal acceleration of electrons in storage rings which was used\nin the Unruh temperature (1) to estimate the temperature. The centripetal acceleration\n6\n\n\fof these storage ring electrons, which are moving essentially at the speed of light, is given\nby a = \u03b3 2 c2 /R where \u03b3 is the standard relativistic gamma-factor (which was O(105 ) for\nthe storage rings considered in [3]), R is the radius of the orbit, and v \u2192 c since the\nvelocity of the electrons was essentially the speed of light. As pointed out in [3, 8, 9] there\nwere two important differences between between the Unruh effect for linear acceleration\nand the Unruh effect for circular acceleration: (i) For circular motion the spectrum is not\nexactly thermal (ii) The temperature for the circular case did not have a simple expression\nas (1). In the relativistic limit one could define the effective temperature by (9). This\n\u221a\nexpression implied an Unruh-like temperature for circular motion \u03c0/ 3 \u2248 1.8 times that\nfor linear acceleration. However, since the spectrum is no longer thermal the definition\nof a temperature for circular acceleration was not as clear as for linear acceleration. In\nthe present paper we will conservatively use the lower temperature (1) to estimate the\ntemperature experienced by the outer electrons due to their centripetal acceleration. Using\n(9) instead of (1) would make the proposed effect even more pronounced. Also as mentioned\nin the previous section even (9) is a lower bound on the actual temperature one would get\nby doing the full path integral treatment of the problem. In the full path integral solution\neach non-classical path would contribute some positive temperature so that the final result\nwould be larger than (9).\nThe effect that we propose is that for certain atoms the centripetal acceleration of the\nouter shell electrons is of order 1023 m/s2 . This is equal to or greater than the acceleration\nexperienced by the electrons in the storage rings considered in [3]. Thus we propose that\nthe outer shell electrons for these atoms experience large effective temperatures in the range\n1000 \u2212 2000 K. These atoms additionally have excited energy levels which are close enough\nto the lowest energy level so that this effective Unruh temperature can shift the expected\nground state with all (or effectively all for low ambient temperature) the electrons in the\nlowest energy level, to a mixed state where there is some significant occupancy of the higher\nenergy levels which are nearby the lowest energy level. The centripetal acceleration of an\nelectron in an atom can be determined from the centripetal potential\nVc (r) =\n\nl(l + 1)~2\n,\n2me r 2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere me is the electron mass. The centripetal force is determined via Fc = \u2212\u2207Vc (r) =\n\n7\n\n\f\u2212\u2202Vc /\u2202r and the centripetal acceleration is\nac (r) =\n\nFc\nl(l + 1)~2\n=\n.\nme\nm2e r 3\n\n(11)\n\nThis is simply the centripetal acceleration calculated from the standard centripetal potential\nterm in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a radial potential. To avoid confusion we want to\nstress at this point that the Unruh-like radiation we will discuss, and which we claim can\npermanently shift some of the electrons from the lowest energy level to nearby energy levels\nhas nothing to do with the old classical arguments that a classical electron in orbit around\nan atomic nucleus would be unstable due to emission of classical radiation associated with\nits acceleration. For one thing, with hydrogen in the ground state, l = 0 so from (11) the\ncentripetal acceleration would be zero and thus from (1) or (9) our proposed effect would\nvanish. Also our proposed effect involves the electrons absorbing radiation from the quantum\nvacuum not emitting radiation. The radiation and temperature we are discussing is purely\nquantum mechanical since in the limit ~ \u2192 0 the acceleration and Unruh-like temperature\nvanish and our effect goes away. In any case our proposed effect has nothing to do with the\nold arguments about the instability of atoms due to classical radiation by the electrons. The\neffect we are proposing could be compared to the Lamb shift where an electron interacts with\nits own quantized electromagnetic field resulting in a tiny shift in energy levels. Our proposed\neffect comes from the electrons interacting with the background, quantized electromagnetic\nfield rather than the electrons self field. In this sense our proposed effect is similar to the\nUnruh effect, Hawking effect or Casimir effect all of which rely on quantized background\nelectromagnetic fields. The Lamb shift is an \"internal\" effect where the electron interacts\nwith its own quantized electromagnetic field, while the present proposed effect (as well as\nHawking radiation, Unruh radiation, and the Casimir effect) is an \"external\" effect which is\ndue to interaction with the background, vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields due\nto the acceleration of the system (an electron in our case). This difference is manifested in\nthat for the Lamb shift the internal energy level structure of the system is altered whereas for\nour proposed effect the internal energy levels of the system are not changed but the fraction\nof electrons occupying a particular level is shifted. The expected ground state where all,\nor almost all, of the electrons are in the lowest energy level, is altered so that there is now\npredicted to be some occupancy of excited energy levels which are close to the lowest energy\nlevel. This shift of the ground state occupancy is as if the atoms are sitting in a heat bath\n8\n\n\fat some temperature given by (2).\nReturning to (11) and (1) (recall to be conservative we are estimating the temperature\nassociated with the acceleration via the linear formula (1) instead of the approximate circular\nformula (9)) we note that in order to have a non-zero temperature, we need a non-zero\nacceleration which means we need l \u2265 1. For an outer electron with l = 1, as is the case for\nfluorine and oxygen, and taking the radius to be the characteristic atomic size, r = 10\u221210 m,\n\ngives an acceleration and temperature of ac = 2.68 \u00d7 1022 m/s2 and T \u2248 110 K. While this\nresults is one order of magnitude less than the temperature found for circulating electrons\nin storage rings it is easy to see that, due the the inverse cubic dependence on the radius,\nas one makes the radius smaller than r = 10\u221210 m one can get temperatures that are of\nthe order or larger to those found for electrons in storage rings. Table I gives the radii and\nestimated Unruh temperature, from (1), for oxygen and fluorine. Both of these atoms have\nTABLE I: Radius, centripetal acceleration and Unruh temperature of the outer shell electrons\n\na\n\nAtom\n\nradius\n\nOxygen\n\n0.45 \u00d710\u221210 m\n\n2.94 \u00d71023 m/s2\n\n1200\n\nK\n\nFluorine\n\n0.40 \u00d710\u221210 m\n\n4.19 \u00d71023 m/s2\n\n1700\n\nK\n\na\n\ncentripetal acceleration Unruh temperature\n\nThe radius is defined by the peak of the calculated charge density of the outer orbital [21]\n\nouter shell electrons with l = 1. We did not consider helium which has the smallest radius\nbecause its outer electrons have l = 0 and thus from (11) have ac = 0. Neon is also not\na good candidate. Although its outer shell electrons have a smaller radius and therefore\nhigher effective Unruh temperature than fluorine or oxygen, the low lying excited levels are\ntoo far above the lowest energy level for this temperature to be able to \"thermally\" excite a\nsignificant number of electrons into these excited levels. However, singly ionized neon (and\nalso singly ionized nitrogen) do have low lying excited levels above the lowest energy level\nand their radius is smaller and thus the effective Unruh temperature is larger than for oxygen\nand fluorine. Thus these ions may also allow one to look for this effect. The difficulty with\nlooking for this effect with neon or nitrogen ions is that in order to keep them ionized they\nmay need to be kept in a large background temperature. This would mask the effect of the\nUnruh temperature. In this paper we focus on fluorine and oxygen, since for these neutral\natoms one can test for the proposed effect with a low background temperature.\n9\n\n\fAgain, one might object that for the electrons in storage rings considered in [3] the paths\nfollowed are classical, while the \"paths\" of the electrons in the outer shells of atoms are\nquantum eigenstates. However, these electrons in the outer shell of atoms do experience\na centripetal acceleration (11) similar to the electrons following classical paths in storage\nrings. It is on this basis of having a similar magnitude of acceleration that we contend\nthat the outer electrons in fluorine and oxygen should also experience an effective Unruh\ntemperature. As mentioned before, if the outer electrons do not experience an effective\nUnruh temperature in connection with the centripetal acceleration (11) this in itself would\nbe an interesting discovery. It would show that there is some fundamental difference between\nclassical acceleration and quantum acceleration in the sense that acceleration in a quantum\neigenstate does not lead to an Unruh temperature.\nIn the next section we make the prediction that the low lying excited energy levels of the\natoms in table I will become populated to a much greater degree than would be expected\nby the background temperature. If this effect is not seen then it indicates there is some\nfundamental difference between classical and quantum accelerations. One can raise a general\nobjection to the existence of this process. If this effect really occurs it seems one would be\nable to continually extract energy from the vacuum as follows: (i) The Unruh temperature\nexperienced by the outer electrons would excite them into the low lying excited levels;\n(ii) eventually these Unruh excited electrons would jump back to the lowest energy level\nemitting a photon which could be captured as usable energy; (iii) the electron in the lowest\nenergy level would eventually be excited back into the low lying excited level by the Unruh\ntemperature and the process would repeat allowing a continual extraction of energy via\nthe emitted photons. This argument would seem indicate the non-existence of this process.\nHowever, while it is generally accepted that a quantum system with a lowest energy level\nand an excited level (i.e. and Unruh-DeWitt detector) has some probability to transition\nto the excited level when it undergoes accelerated motion, there is still a question whether\nthis excited/thermalized Unruh-DeWitt detector will radiate. In [20] Ford and O'Connell\nstudy a mechanical oscillator moving in one spatial dimension which is coupled to a scalar\nfield. The oscillator plays the role of the Unruh-DeWitt detector and the scalar field plays\nthe role of the photon. They investigate the expectation of the total flux of field energy,\nhj(y, t)i, radiated by the oscillator at some arbitrary point y. They get the following general\n\n10\n\n\frelationship [20]\nhj(y, t)i = hj0 (y, t)i + hjdir (y, t)i + hjint (y, t)i .\n\n(12)\n\nIn this formula hj0 (y, t)i is the flux of scalar field radiation in the absence of the oscillator.\nThe second term, hjdir (y, t)i, is the power radiated by the oscillator and corresponds to the\n1D analog of the Larmor formula (Ford and O'Connell find that this term is proportional to\nthe square of the velocity of the oscillator rather than the square of the acceleration as is the\ncase of the usual Larmor formula. This difference comes about because Ford and O'Connell\nare using a scalar rather than a vector field). The third term, hjint (y, t)i, represents the\nflux of energy from the field back to the oscillator. The condition for oscillator to be in\nequilibrium is hjdir (y, t)i = \u2212hjint (y, t)i i.e. the total flux of energy is zero hj(y, t)i = 0.\nSince hj0 (y, t)i is the energy flux of the scalar field in the absence of the oscillator this should\nbe zero and this is confirmed by direct calculation in [20]. By direct calculation [20] it is\nshown that when the oscillator undergoes uniform, constant acceleration (i.e. hyperbolic\nmotion) that the condition hjdir (y, t)i = \u2212hjint (y, t)i is satisfied. As a result the oscillator\nwill move from the lowest energy level to a higher energy and remain there. The loss in\nenergy of the oscillator due to the hjdir (y, t)i term is made up by the gain in energy of the\noscillator due to the hjint (y, t)i term. Applying the result of Ford and O'Connell to the\nproposed circular Unruh effect on atomic electrons in fluorine and oxygen would imply that\nthere is a permanent, larger than expected occupancy of the electrons in excited energy levels\nwhich are close to the lowest energy level. Our proposed experiment below would provide\na test of the correctness (or not) of the claim in [20] \u2013 that an Unruh-Dewitt detector (the\nouter shell electrons in fluorine and oxygen in our case) will have particles excited to the\nupper energy level(s) to a greater than expected degree depending on the Unruh temperature\nbut will not radiate.\n\nIV.\n\nLOW LYING ENERGY LEVELS OF FLUORINE AND OXYGEN\n\nIn addition to the relatively large estimated Unruh temperatures of fluorine and oxygen\ngiven in table I, these atoms also have low lying excited levels \u2013 0.05 eV or less above the\nlowest level. The ground level of fluorine is 2 P3/2 and for oxygen is 3 P2 . The energies and\nequivalent temperatures of the low lying excited levels of fluorine and oxygen are given in\ntable II. The prediction we make is that the estimated effective Unruh temperatures in\n11\n\n\fTABLE II: Energy of the low lying, excited energy levels above the lowest level, equivalent temperatures, and spectroscopic notation.\n\na\n\nAtom\n\nspec. notation\n\n\u2206Ei1 = Ei \u2212 E1\n\nOxygen\n\n3P\n\n1\n\n0.02 eV\n\nFluorine\n\n2P\n\n1/2\n\n;\n\n3P\n\n0\n\nT = \u2206Ei1 /kB\n\na\n\n; 0.03 eV\n\n0.05 eV\n\n232 K ;\n\n348 K\n\n580 K\n\nThe energies of the low lying levels, i = 2, 3, above the lowest level, 1, are found at [22] where they are\n\ngiven as inverse wavelengths in cm\u22121 . Here we have converted the inverse wavelengths to energies in eV\n\ntable I will \"thermally\" shift the occupancy of the lowest energy level and nearby energy\nlevels so that the low lying excited levels will be populated by more electrons than would be\nexpected from the background temperature \u2013 assuming that the background temperature is\nroom temperature (\u2248 300 K) or less. To make the contrast bigger, we assume a background\ntemperature of 100 K, which is above the boiling point for both gases. Thus the atoms\nwould be in the gas phase. To calculate the fraction of the electrons populating the low\nlying excited levels listed in table II due to thermal excitation we use the density matrix\nformalism. The density matrix is\n\u03c1=\nwhere Z = T r(exp(\u2212\u0124/kB T ) =\n\nP\n\nj\n\nexp(\u2212\u0124/kB T )\n,\nZ\n\n(13)\n\nexp(\u2212Ej /kB T ) is the partition function and \u0124 is the\n\nHamiltonian operator for the system.

This is a good approximation for the effective Unruh temperatures or background temperatures that we deal with. In (15) \u2206E23 = E2 \u2212 E3 = \u22120.01 eV and i = 2 goes\n12\n\n\fwith +\u2206E23 and i = 3 goes with \u2212\u2206E23 . Using (15) and the data from table II we give\nthe expected fraction of electrons excited into the low lying excited levels for background\ntemperatures T = 100 K, for T = 300 K and for the effective Unruh temperatures given in\ntable I. From table III one can see that the difference in the fraction of electrons populating\nthe low lying excited levels based on the background temperature versus the effective Unruh\ntemperature can be significant especially if one does the measurement at low background\ntemperature (i.e. T = 100 K). The difference between the fraction of electrons populating\nthe low lying excited levels due to the proposed Unruh effect versus what one would expect\ndue to room temperature (T = 300 K) is not so big for oxygen; for fluorine the estimated\nUnruh excited fraction is only 3 times as large as the expected excitation due to room temperature. This may explain why this effect has not been noticed so far since one needs to\nmeasure the population of the low lying levels at the lowest possible temperature. Thus our\nprediction is that if one measures the fraction of electrons populating these low lying energy\nlevels for oxygen and fluorine, due to the effective Unruh temperature, these levels will be\npopulated to a greater than expected degree, especially if the comparison is made with low\nbackground temperature. One concrete way to test for this predicted higher occupancy of\nthe low lying excited level(s) versus the lowest energy level would be to chose some higher\nexcited level and send in photons corresponding to the energy of transition between the\nlowest energy level and the higher excited level. Next send in photons corresponding to\nthe energy of transition between the low lying excited level(s) and the higher excited level.\nIf the low lying excited levels are populated to a greater than expected degree due to the\nproposed effect the absorption of the photon corresponding to the transition between the\nlow lying excited level(s) and the higher excited level should be proportionally larger.\nTABLE III: The fraction of electrons populating the low lying excited levels from table II assuming\nthese levels are populated by thermal excitations of a background temperature versus the effective\nUnruh temperature\nAtom\n\nconfiguration\n\nf (T = 100K)\n\nf (T = 300K)\n\nf (TU nruh )\n\nOxygen\n\n3P\n\n1\n\n0.07\n\n0.22\n\n0.30\n\nFluorine\n\n2P\n\n1/2\n\n;\n\n3P\n\n0\n\n; 0.03\n\n0.003\n\n0.13\n\n13\n\n; 0.21\n\n0.42\n\n; 0.31\n\n\fV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we propose a possible test for the circular Unruh effect where the outer\nelectrons of certain atoms (fluorine and oxygen) experience large centripetal accelerations\n(11) which should correspond to large effective Unruh temperatures (1). Although it is\nhard/impossible to talk about a classical path for electrons in quantum energy levels, in the\npath integral approach to quantum mechanics the electron tries out every possible path, with\neach path being weighted by exp[i * Action]. The classical path has the largest weight. Our\ncontention is that each path will have a temperature associated with it and the path integral\naveraged sum of all these temperatures for all paths can be estimated via a conservative lower\nbound of (1). With the estimated Unruh temperatures given in table I, all of which are larger\nthan the assumed background temperature, occupancy of the electrons in the lowest energy\nlevel and nearby levels will be \"thermally\" shifted \u2013 there will be a larger than expected\nnumber of electrons occupying the low lying excited levels. The effect proposed here for\natomic electrons is similar to the Bell and Leinaas effect, except that the classical path of\n[3] [8] [9] is replaced by quantum paths (i.e. a path integral). We stress again that this\nproposed effect has nothing to do with the old arguments for the instability of atoms due\nto classical radiation of electrons. In our proposed effect the occupancy of the electrons in\nthe low lying excited level(s) are \"thermally\" shifted by quanta from the vacuum. This is\nsimilar to the Lamb shift where hydrogen energy levels are shifted due to the interaction\nof the electron with its own quantized \"internal\" electromagnetic field. In the present case\nthe electrons are interacting with the \"external\" quantized vacuum electromagnetic fields.\nAnother distinction is that in the present case the energy levels are not shifted but the ground\nstate occupancy of the levels is permanently altered. The permanence of this shift in the\noccupation of the low lying excited energy levels follows from the results of [20] \u2013 although\nthe electrons are shifted to low lying excited levels as if they were exposed to a temperature\nbath they will not de-excite. This is the result of the balancing of the flow of energy from the\noscillator to the field (i.e. hjdir (y, t)i) with the flow of energy from the field to the oscillator\n(i.e. hjint (y, t)i). For hyperbolic motion this means hjdir (y, t)i = \u2212hjint (y, t)i. The works\n[23] [24] come to similar conclusions.\nThere are other possibilities for testing for this effect. First, as briefly discussed above,\none could look at singly ionized nitrogen or singly ionized neon. The radii for both ions are\n14\n\n\fless than the radius of neutral neon (i.e. r \u2264 0.35 \u00d7 10\u221210 m) which implies a temperature\ngreater than T \u2265 2500 K. Also, in contrast to neutral nitrogen and neon atoms, both\nions have excited levels (\u2206EN + = 0.006 eV, \u2206EN + = 0.016 eV and \u2206EN e+ = 0.10 eV\nrespectively) which are low enough to be significantly populated by the effective Unruh\ntemperature T \u2265 2500 K. The difficulty is that in order to keep nitrogen and neon ionized\none may need to have a large background temperature to begin with which would mask\nthe proposed effect. A second possibility for testing this effect would be to induce a level\nsplitting using an external magnetic field (i.e. use the Zeeman effect). For example, applying\nan external magnetic field to fluorine would split the ground state 2 P3/2 into four different\nlevels with mj = + 23 and mj = + 12 levels shifted upward. The lowest lying excited levels\nof fluorine 2 P1/2 would split into two levels with the mj = \u2212 12 level shifted lower. Thus\n\nthe mj = + 23 and mj = + 21 levels of the ground state 2 P3/2 and the mj = \u2212 12 level of\n\n2\n\nP1/2 lowest lying excited levels would have a smaller energy difference than without the\n\nmagnetic field, and the effective Unruh temperature of fluorine, T = 1700 K, will more\neasily be able to populate the mj = \u2212 12 level of 2 P1/2 . We are currently investigating these\nextensions of the proposed effect. A third possibility for looking for this effect would be\nto look at nuclei. In the shell model of the nucleus the individual nucleons occupy shells\nwhich have orbital angular momenta. The characteristic nuclear size is 10\u221215 m as opposed\nto the characteristic atomic size of 10\u221210 m. This five order of magnitude difference in size\nwould greatly enhance the centripetal acceleration of (11). However, nucleons are \u2248 2000\ntimes heavier than electrons which would make the centripetal acceleration smaller by this\namount. Still the decrease in size would still be the larger effect due to the r \u22123 dependence\nin (11). But nuclear energy levels are generally in the MeV range rather than the eV range of\natomic physics. The goal would be to find some nucleus with a small radius, whose nucleons\nhad a non-zero orbital angular momentum and which had low lying excited energy levels\nabove the lowest level.\nIn conclusion we predict that the population of the low lying excited levels of fluorine and\noxygen will have a higher than expected occupation (compare the last column in table III\nwith the two preceding columns). Seeing this larger than expected occupation would provide\nevidence to the Unruh effect. To make the contrast the largest, the experiment should be\ndone at the lowest possible background temperature. Not seeing this larger than expected\noccupation would indicate some fundamental difference between acceleration at the classical\n15\n\n\fversus quantum level.\n\n[1] W.G. Unruh, Phys. Rev.
