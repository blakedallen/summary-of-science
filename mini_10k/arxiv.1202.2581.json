We present two Rado-like conditions which are respectively necessary and sufficient for an equation\nto be graph-regular.\n\nKeywords: coloring; graph theory; Ramsey theory; Rado's theorem\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRamsey's theorem [3][8] states that, given numbers r and k, there is an\nR = R(r, k) so that any r-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on R\nvertices contains a monochromatic complete graph on k vertices.\nElsewhere in Ramsey theory, the related (but seemingly-unconnected)\nresult of Rado [2][3][7] characterizes the set of linear equations Ax = 0 such\nthat, whenever N is finitely colored, there is a solution whose entries fall into\nthe same color class. Such an equation is called partition-regular.\nThese two results were connected in a result by Deuber, Gunderson, Hindman, and Strauss [1], and followed up by Gunderson, Leader, Pr\u00f6mel, and\nR\u00f6dl [4][5]. Their results describe the equations Ax = 0 such that, for any\nm, a large two-colored graph must either contain a complete blue subgraph\nwhose vertices solve the equation, or a red Km with no implied structure. If\none can assure that there is no red Km , then the desired structured set falls\nout nicely.\nThe first example of an equation with an unconditional monochromatic\nsolution was given in [6]. That paper introduced the notion of a graph-regular\nequation.\n1\n\n\fDef 1.1 We say Ax = 0 is graph-regular if there is a function NA (r) so that,\nfor all r, for all N > NA (r), every r-coloring of the complete graph on [N]\nhas a solution x = (x(1), . . . , x(k)) so that (1) the edges {x(i), x(j)} are all\nthe same color, and (2) the values {x(i)} are distinct.\nWe require a solution by distinct values due to degeneracy issues which\ndo not appear in the case of coloring points. Further, for non-triviality, we\nrequire the equation to contain at least three variables.\nIn this paper, we give two extensions of Rado's \"columns condition\" to the\ngraph setting - the weak and strong graph columns conditions. We will show\nthat the weak version is necessary for an equation to be graph-regular, and\nthe strong version is sufficient. We also show that the notions of partitionregular and graph-regular equations do not have a satisfying extension to\nhypergraph-regular equations.\n\n2\n\nThe Graph Columns Condition\n\n2.1\n\nDefinitions\n\nRado's theorem [3][7] characterizes the regular equations with use of the\ncolumns condition, which we state here.\nDef 2.1 A matrix A with n columns satisfies the columns condition if there is\na sequence of vectors z1 , . . . , zT in the nullspace of A and decreasing sequence\nof sets R1 \u2287 . . . \u2287 RT so that\n1. If i \u2208 Rt , then zs (i) = 0 for all s \u2264 t.\n2. If i \u2208\n/ Rt , then there is an s \u2264 t with zs (i) = 1\n3. RT = \u2205.\nAlthough it is not commonly stated in this language, the above is easily seen\nto be equivalent to the usual definition.\nThe remarkable fact, proven for example in [3], is that the columns condition determines whether an equation is regular.\nLemma 2.2 The equation Ax = 0 has a monochromatic solution under any\nfinite coloring of N whenever A satisfies the columns condition. If A does\n2\n\n\fnot satisfy the columns condition then there is some p0 = p0 (A) so that, for\nevery prime p > p0 , a monochromatic solution is avoided by the coloring \u03c8p\n(which will be introduced in Section 3.1).\nThere are several ways to extend the columns condition to apply to edgecolorings. We state two.\nDef 2.3 We say a matrix A with n columns satisfies the weak graph columns\ncondition (WGCC) if there is a sequence of vectors z0 , . . . , zT in the nullspace\nof A, and a decreasing sequence of graphs R0 \u2287 . . . \u2287 RT with common vertex\nset [n] so that\n1. If {i, j} \u2208 Rt , then zs (i) = zs (j) for all s < t.\n2. If {i, j} \u2208\n/ Rt , then there is an s \u2264 t with |zs (j) \u2212 zs (i)| = 1.\n3. RT is empty.\n4. z0 = 1.\nFurther, we say A satisfies the strong graph columns condition (SGCC) if\nwe may replace (1) and (2) by (1\u2217 ) and (2\u2217 ):\n1\u2217 . If {i, j} \u2208 Rt , zs (i) = zs (j) \u2208 {0, 1} for all s < t\n2\u2217 . If {i, j} \u2208\n/ Rt , then there is an s \u2264 t with zs (i) = 0 and zs (j) = 1 (or\nvice versa).\nIn words, the zt 's are restricted so that, for each i, j pair, as t increases,\nthe values zt (i), zt (j) are initially equal, remain equal until they differ by\nexactly 1, and are unrestricted after that. An edge between i and j on graph\nRt means that pair remains restricted through time t. If {i, j} \u2208 Rt , then we\nsay the pair is restricted at time t, otherwise it is unrestricted.\nThe strong graph columns conditions requires conditions on the values\nzt (i) in addition to the differences across edges.\nExample 2.4 Let\nA=\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u22121 0 \u22121 4 \u22123\n0\n0 1 \u22121 1 \u22121\n\n3\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n\fHere is one sequence of vectors showing A satisfies the graph columns condition (weak and strong):\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nz3 = \uf8ec\nz2 = \uf8ec\nz1 = \uf8ec\nz0 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 1 \uf8f8\n1\n0\n0\n1\nThe corresponding restriction graphs may be described simply:\n\n\u2022 R1 : All edges among {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5, 6} remain restricted.\n\u2022 R2 : Edges {3, 4} and {5, 6} remain restricted.\n\u2022 R3 is empty - no edges are restricted.\nNote that, at each step, Rt is a union of disjoint cliques.

If Ax = 0 is graph-regular, then A satisfies\nthe weak graph columns condition. If A satisfies the strong graph columns\ncondition, then Ax = 0 is graph-regular.\nWe will prove WGCC is necessary in Section 3, using Lemma 2.2. In\nSection 4, we will show SGCC is sufficient, using machinery from [6].\n\n3\n3.1\n\nNecessary conditions for graph-regularity\nCoefficients must add to 0\n\nRado's theorem tells us that, when coloring N, an equation is regular precisely\nif it has a monochromatic solution under a particular class of colorings -\nthe so-called \"super mod p\" colorings [3]. The idea is to color each number\nby factoring out any power of p, and color by what remains. We will use\nrelated colorings to avoid monochromatic solutions to many equations in the\ngraph setting. The super mod p coloring itself will be introduced as \u03c8p later\non.\n\u0001\nConsider fn , a coloring of N2 given by\n\u001a\nblue\nif x = y\nfn (an + x, bn + y) =\nmin{x, y} if x 6= y,\nwhere x, y \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1}.\nAlthough strange, consider its purpose. We claim that all monochromatic\ntriangles under fn are blue. Consider a triangle x = an + i, y = bn + j, z =\ncn + k, with i, j, k \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1}.\nSuppose no edge among these points is blue. Then the numbers i, j, k\nmust be distinct. Reorder so that i < j < k. Then we see that fn (x, y) =\nfn (x, z) = i, while fn (y, z) = j 6= i. Thus a triangle without a blue edge\ncannot be monochromatic. Turning this around, any monochromatic triangle\nmust have one, and hence all, blue edges.\nGoing back to the definition of fn , this means that any monochromatic\ntriangle (and hence any non-trivial monochromatic clique) must represent\nonly one congruence class mod n.\nThis means any equation which has no solution within a congruence class\nmay be avoided by using fn . The only problem now is that this doesn't\n5\n\n\factually rule out any linear homogeneous equation - they may all be solved\nby multiples of n. By making a slight change, however, this becomes very\npowerful.\n\u0001\nFix a prime p, and define the coloring gp of N2 by\n\u001a\nred\nif j 6= k\nj\nk\ngp (p a, p b) =\nfp\u22121 (a, b) if j = k,\nwhere a and b are not divisible by p. Note that this is a p-coloring, since the\nnumbers a and b are always in [p \u2212 1], so their minimum must be in [p \u2212 2].\nAdding in red and blue, we reach p colors.\nThe same argument as above shows that any triangle which is monochromatic under gp must be red or blue. This brings us to our first general\nresult.\nP\nLemma 3.1 If Ax = 0 is graph-regular, then\nai = 0.\n\nProof:\nSince each row of A corresponds to a graph-regular equation, it\nsuffices to consider the case when\n\u0001 A has a single row.\nFix a prime p and color N2 by gp . Suppose x1 , . . . , xk are distinct values\nsatisfying a1 x1 + . . . + ak xk = 0, with the edges among them monochromatic.\nWrite xi = pri (bi p + ci ). As observed earlier, this clique must be either red\nor blue.\nCase 1: The clique is red. This means each ri is distinct. Let rj be the\nlowest exponent. We see that\nX\n0 =\na pri (bi p + ci )\nX i\n=\nai pri \u2212rj (bi p + ci )\n!\nX\nri \u2212rj \u22121\np\n(bi p + ci )\n= aj (bj p + cj ) + p\ni6=j\n\n\u2261 aj cj\n\nmod p.\n\nSince p does not divide cj , it must divide aj instead.\nCase 2: The clique is blue. This means each ri = r, and each ci = c. We\nsee that\nX\n0 =\nai pr (bi p + c)\nX\n=\nai (bi p + c)\n\u0011\n\u0010X\nai\nmod p.\n\u2261 c\n6\n\n\fSince p does not divide c, it must divide\n\nP\n\nai instead.\n\nSince every gp must havePa monchromatic solution, each p gives a new\ndivisor to one of {a1 , . . . , ak , ai }. Therefore one of them must be divisible\nby infinitely many\nP primes. Since a1 , . . . , ak are assumed to be non-zero, it\nmust be that\nai = 0. \u0003\nConsider such an equation, a1 x1 + . . . + ak xk = 0, where the coefficients\nsum to 0. We may rewrite this as, for instance,\na1 (x1 \u2212 xk ) + . . . + ak\u22121 (xk\u22121 \u2212 xk ) = 0,\nnow an equation relating differences. This suggests that we should consider\ncolorings based on these differences - colorings of the form \u03c7(x < y) =\nf (y \u2212 x). We may now take guidance from Rado's theorem to get a better\nhandle on things.\nFor a prime p, and x = pr (bp + s), let \u03c8p (x) = s \u2208 [p \u2212 1] be the \"super\nmod p\" coloring. Rado's theorem says that the regular systems of linear\nequations are precisely those which have monochromatic solutions under \u03c8p\nfor all p. This, he found, is equivalent to satisfying the \"columns condition,\"\nwhich we will discuss more later. For a single equation, it simply requires\nthat some (nonempty) subset of the coefficients add to zero.\nFor us, Rado's theorem suggests that every equation which we can avoid\nwith this type of coloring (based only on differences between endpoints) will\nalso be avoided by some \u03c8p . This is a powerful idea, but we begin with a\nsimple consequence.\nP\nTheorem 3.2 Let ki=1 ai xi = 0 be graph-regular. Then there is a nonempty\nset I ( [k] so that\nX\nX\nai =\naj = 0.\ni\u2208I\n\nj \u2208I\n/\n\n\u0001\nTo prove this, we introduce an important coloring. Define \u03c6p : N2 \u2192\n[p \u2212 1] by\n\u03c6p (x < y) = \u03c8p (y \u2212 x).\n\u0001\nProof:\nFix a prime p and color N2 by \u03c6p . Suppose x1 , . . . , xk are distinct\nvalues satisfying a1 x1 + . . . + ak xk = 0, with the edges among them all color\nc. Let xj be the smallest of these values. As noted earlier, we see that\nX\nai (xi \u2212 xj ) = 0.\ni6=j\n\n7\n\n\fBy choice of xj , each of the terms xi \u2212 xj is positive. Thus we may write\nxi \u2212xj = pri (bi +c), since \u03c6p (xj < xi ) = \u03c8p (xi \u2212xj ) = c. Let r be the smallest\nexponent among these k \u2212 1 terms, and let I = {i \u2208 [k] \\ {j} | ri = r}. Note\nthat \u2205 ( I ( [k].

Since we already know\nP\nP\nthat ki=1 ai = 0, we learn that i\u2208I\n\u0003\n/ ai = 0 as well.\nWe may now prove what we already knew:\n\nCorollary 3.3 No nondegenerate homogeneous linear equation of three variables is graph-regular.\nProof:\nLet k = 3, and let I ( {1, 2, 3} be nonempty. Then either I or its\ncomplement has a single element. The corresponding coefficient must be 0,\nmeaning the equation depends on at most two variables. \u0003\nCorollary 3.4 Up to rescaling, the only graph-regular homogeneous linear\nequation of four variables is w \u2212 x + y \u2212 z = 0.\nThat this equation is regular was shown in [6]. We show that it stands\nalone.\nProof:\nLet aw + bx + cy + dz = 0 be graph-regular, with a, b, c, d \u2208 Z6=0 .\nBy Theorem 3.2, we know that two complementary subsets of the coefficients\nmust add to zero. Up to permutation, this leaves us with aw\u2212ax+cy\u2212cz = 0,\nor rather a(w \u2212 x) = c(z \u2212 y). We may assume both a and c are positive by\nswitching w and x, or y and z. We claim a = c.\n8\n\n\fSuppose not; without loss of generality, a < c. By cancelling common\ndivisors, we may assume a and c are relatively prime. Hence c = pr11 * * * prkk ,\nwhere\u0001none of these primes divides a. Let n = r1 + 1. Define an n-coloring\n\u03c7 : N2 \u2192 Z/nZ by\n\u03c7(x, y) \u2261 k\n\n(mod n)\n\nif (x \u2212 y) is divisible by pk1 , but not by pk+1\n1 .\n\nNow suppose a(w \u2212 x) = c(z \u2212 y), with w, x, y, z distinct. Let \u03c7(w, x) = k.\nThis means that a(w \u2212 x) represents a power of pk1 on the left hand side.\n1\nDividing by c, we learn that (z \u2212 y) represents a power of pk\u2212r\n, so \u03c7(y, z) \u2261\n1\nk \u2212 r1 \u2261 k + 1 6\u2261 k (mod n). Thus \u03c7(w, x) 6= \u03c7(y, z), so the edges among\n{w, x, y, z} are not monochromatic. \u0003\n\n3.2\n\nConsidering \u03c6p\n\nLemma 3.5 Let A be a matrix whose columns sum to 0. If the equation\nAx = 0 has a monochromatic solution under the edge-coloring \u03c6p for every\nprime p, then A satisfies the weak graph columns condition.\nProof:\nLet Ax = 0 have a monochromatic coloring under \u03c6p for every\nprime p. Denote the columns of A by {ai }ni=1 .\n\u0001\nFrom A, we will make a larger matrix C with columns indexed by [n]\n=\n2\n{(i, j) | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n}. The columns of C come from gluing the columns of\nA (or the zero vector) to new vectors which bind relationships between the\ncolumns of A.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\naj\n0\nc1j = \uf8ed - \uf8f8 , and cij = \uf8ed - \uf8f8 if i > 1,\nb1j\nbij\nwhere\n\n\uf8f1\nif (k, l) = (1, j)\n\uf8f2 1\n\u22121 if (k, l) = (1, i) or (i, j)\nbij (k, l) =\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise.\n\nNote that\nP the matrix C does not explicitly contain the column a1 . However, since\nai = 0, that information is not lost.\nSuppose Cy = 0, with y(1, j) = x(j) \u2212 x(1). The vectors {bij } are\ndesigned so that y(i, j) = x(j) \u2212 x(i).\n9\n\n\fTurned around, when Ax = 0, and y is defined above, we get Cy = 0.\nLikewise, if Cy = 0 then, for any value x(1), the values x(i) are uniquely\ndefined from y, and they satisfy Ax = 0.\nWe would like to say that, when Ax = 0 is a monochromatic solution under the edge-coloring \u03c6p , the corresponding solution to Cy = 0 is monochromatic under the vertex-coloring \u03c8p . However, this is not quite true. The\ndefinition says \u03c6p (x, y) = \u03c8p (y \u2212 x) only when x < y. For a monochromatic\nsolution under \u03c8p , we would need x(1) < x(2) < . . . < x(n). Instead, for\neach permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn , we must define the matrix C(\u03c3) which will \"work\"\nwhen x(\u03c3(1)) < x(\u03c3(2)) < . . . < x(\u03c3(n)). We omit the definition of C(\u03c3),\nbut it is essentially the same as C, defined in such a way that y(i, j) is always\na positive number when x is ordered by \u03c3.\nIf x is a solution to Ax = 0, with x(\u03c3(1)) < x(\u03c3(2)) < . . . x(\u03c3(n)),\nthen there is a corresponding solution to C(\u03c3)y = 0 by positive numbers,\nwhere y(i, j) = x(\u03c3(j)) \u2212 x(\u03c3(i)). When x is monochromatic under \u03c6p , y is\nmonochromatic under \u03c8p .\nClaim: some C(\u03c3) satisfies the columns condition.\nProof: If not, then Lemma 2.2 says each \u03c3, gives a value p0 (C(\u03c3)) so\nthat, for p > p0 (C(\u03c3)) prime, C(\u03c3) has no monochromatic solutions under\n\u03c8p . Let p0 = max\u03c3\u2208Sn {p0 (C(\u03c3))}. Take a prime p > p0 . Since Ax = 0\nhas a monochromatic solution under \u03c6p , there must be some \u03c3 \u2208 Sn so that\nC(\u03c3) has a monochromatic solution under \u03c8p . As p > p0 (C(\u03c3)), this is a\ncontradiction.\nFix \u03c3 so that C(\u03c3) satisfies the columns condition. This means there are\nvectors z1 , . . . , zT in the nullspace of C(\u03c3), and decreasing graphs R1 \u2287\n. . . \u2287 RT = \u2205 satisfying:\n1. If i \u2208 Rt , then zs (i) = 0 for all s < t.\n2. If i \u2208\n/ Rt , then there is an s \u2264 t with zs (i) = 1.\n3. RT = \u2205.\nFor simplicity, we reorder the columns of A so that \u03c3 is the identity, and\nC(\u03c3) is the matrix C described originally.\n\u0001\nThis means there are vectors w1 , . . . , wT indexed by [n]\n, and sets R1 \u2287\n2\n\u0001\n[n]\n. . . \u2287 RT = \u2205 with vertex set 2 satisfying conditions (1)-(3) of Definition 2.1.\n10\n\n\fDefine a sequence of vectors z1 , . . . , zT on [n] by zt (1) = 0, and zt (i) =\nwt (1, i) for i > 1. Additionally define z0 = 1 and R0 = [n]. We just need\n{zt }, {Rt } to satisfy requirements (1)-(4) of the graph columns condition.\nIt will be helpful to know that, for k < l,\nzt (l) \u2212 zt (k) = wt (k, l)\n\n(1)\n\nTo see this, consider the {k, l} row of the vectors bij within C. Since Cw = 0,\ninspecting this row tells us that\nwt (1, l) \u2212 wt (1, k) = wt (k, l).\nBy definition of zt , we see that\nzt (l) \u2212 zt (k) = wt (k, l)\nas desired.\nUsing this equation, properties (1)-(3) are immediate. Property (4) comes\nfrom the assumption that the columns of A sum to 0. \u0003\nCorollary 3.6 If a matrix A is graph-regular, then it satisfies the weak graph\ncolumns condition.\nProof:\nFrom Lemma 3.1, we know that the columns of A sum to 0. Since\nA is graph-regular, it must have a monochromatic solution under \u03c6p for every\nprime p. By Lemma 3.5, A satisfies the weak graph columns condition. \u0003\nWe end this section by considering the sufficiency of the WGCC.\nCorollary 3.7 If a matrix A satisfies the weak graph columns condition but\nis not graph-regular, then the offending coloring is not of the form \u03c7(x <\ny) = f (y \u2212 x).\nTo see this in action, consider the coloring \u03c6p and the matrix A from\nExample 2.5. Suppose that 1 < r < pk \u2212 1. Consider the vector x in the\nnullspace of A given by\nx = (pk+2 + 1)z1 + (pk+1 + p)z2 + p2 z3\nwhere {vectzi } come from the analysis of this example earlier. It is easy to\ncheck that x(1) > x(2) > . . . > x(8), and that \u03c6p colors all edges by \"1\".\nIndeed, Lemma 3.5 actually shows that all colorings based on the difference of\nthe endpoints will yield a monochromatic solution. Therefore, if the equation\nAx = 0 is not graph-regular, it must be from some other type of coloring.\n11\n\n\f4\n\nSufficient conditions for graph-regularity\n\nWe know that all graph-regular equations satisfy the weak graph columns\ncondition. We now prove the strong graph columns condition. In order to\ndo this, we first define a large, hierarchical parametrized grid.\nDef 4.1 Fix x, y, b, d \u2208 Nn . We say the grid of depth n with parameters\nx,\nSny, b, d - abbreviated Gridn (x, y, b, d) - is the collection of points A =\nk=1 Ak where Ak is the set of points of the form\n!\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\nX\nX\nh(l)d(l) + y(k)d(k) + jd(k + 1)\nh(l)d(l) + x(k)d(k) + id(k + 1),\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\nsuch that h(l) \u2208 {x(l), y(l)} and i, j \u2208 [\u2212c(k), c(k)] for some c(k) \u2265 b(k).\nAs it is not earlier defined, we use d(n + 1) = 0.\nFor such a grid to behave nicely, we always require the parameters to\nsatisfy:\n1. d(k)|d(k + 1),\n2. x(k)b(k), y(k)b(k) \u2264 c(k \u2212 1).\nAs a technical note, the use of c(k) > b(k) comes from requirement (2).\nWe say that a Gridn (x, y, b, d) is \"proper\" if (1) all x-coordinates of\neach of its points is less than all y-coordinates, and (2) each coordinate has\na unique representation of the form\nk\nX\n\nh(l)d(l) + id(k + 1)\n\nl=1\n\nover all values of k \u2208 [n], h(l) \u2208 {x(l), y(l)}, and i, j \u2208 [\u2212c(k), c(k)]. We\nmay thus unambiguously say that a point \"resides at the k th level\" of the\ngrid if its coordinates agree on h(l) for all l < k, but disagree on h(k).\nFor convenience of notation, we will treat a proper Gridn as a graph,\nsince it uniquely stores pairs {x, y}.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.1 in [6] may be easily modified to give the following lemma.\n\n12\n\n\fLemma 4.2 Fix b \u2208 Nn . There is a number Q = Q(r, b) so that every\nr-coloring of [Q]2 admits vectors x, y, d \u2208 Nn such that Gridn (x, y, b, d) is\nproper and monochromatic.\nMoreover, the dependencies are such that the value of b(k) may be a function of upper bounds for x(k + 1), y(k + 1), c(k + 1), and d(k+1)\n.\nd(k)\nThis lemma tells that we can always find a \"large\" monochromatic Gridn .\n\n4.1\n\nA Gridn is enough\n\nSince we know every finite-coloring of [Q] \u00d7 [Q] contains a large monochromatic Gridn (for Q sufficiently large), we only need to show the following.\nLemma 4.3 Let A satisfy the strong graph columns condition. Then there\nis some n, b so that the following holds. For every every proper G =\nGridn (x, y, b, d), there is a solution to Aw = 0 so that, for all i, j, the\nedge {w(i), w(j)} is in G.\nIn particular, if A satisfies the strong graph columns condition in T steps,\nthen we may take n = T .\nProof:\nLet A satisfy the columns condition, by vectors z0 = 1, z1 , . . . , zT\nand graphs R0 \u2287 . . . \u2287 RT = \u2205.\nFix x, y, d \u2208 NT . Define a sequence of vectors by\nvt = x(t)d(t)z0 + (y(t) \u2212 x(t))d(t)zt = x(t)d(t)1 + (y(t) \u2212 x(t))d(t)zt ,\neach in the nullspace\nof A.\nP\nDefine w = Tt=1 vt . As a sum of vectors in the nullspace of A, we have\nAw = 0. We claim that this is the desired solution. It remains to show show\nthat (1) every edge {w(i), w(j)} is in G, and (2) the values w(i) are distinct.\nFix two indices i and j. By the strong columns condition, we know that\nthe values zt (i) and zt (j) are initially equal - with common value 0 or 1 -\nwhen {i, j} \u2208 Rt . There is a first time t\u2217 such that (without loss of generality)\nzt\u2217 (i) = 0 and zt\u2217 (j) = 1.\nMoving to w, we see that zt (i) = 0 contributes x(t) to w(i), and zt (i) = 1\ncontributes y(t) to w(i). Since vt (i) and vt (j) agree for t < t\u2217 , we may\ncall the common contribution at the t step h(t) = x(t) or y(t). At time t\u2217 ,\n\n13\n\n\fv(i) = x(t\u2217 ) while v(j) = y(t\u2217 ). This suggests the edge {w(i), w(j)} should\nreside at the (t\u2217 )th level of G. For t > t\u2217 , we have\n|vt (i)| = |x(t)d(t) + (y(t) \u2212 x(t))d(t)zt (i)|\n= |x(t) + (y(t) \u2212 x(t))zt (i)|d(t)\n\u2264 |y(t) + y(t)zt (i)|d(t)\n\nsince 0 \u2264 x(t) \u2264 y(t)\n\n\u2264 (kzt k\u221e + 1) y(t)d(t)\nThus we see the total contribution to w(i) from the tail of the sum comes to\nX\n\ns>t\u2217\n\nvt (i)\n\n\u2264\n\nX\n\n(kzs k\u221e + 1) y(s)d(s)\n\ns>t\u2217\n\n\u2264 (kzt\u2217 +1 k\u221e + 1) y(t\u2217 + 1)d(t\u2217 + 1) + . . . +\n+ (kzT \u22121 k\u221e + 1) y(T \u2212 1)d(T \u2212 1) + (kzT k\u221e + 1) y(T )d(T )\n\nWe now begin to see an appropriate choice of b. Set\nb(T ) \u2265 kzT k\u221e + 1.\nThe last term of our bound above becomes b(T )y(T )d(T ), which by assumption is less than c(T \u2212 1)d(T ).\nNext take\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd(T )\nb(T \u2212 1) \u2265 (kzT \u22121 k\u221e + 1) y(T \u2212 1) + c(T \u2212 1)\n.\nd(T \u2212 1)\nNow the last two terms of the sum are bounded by c(T \u2212 2)d(T \u2212 1).\nWe may continue this process so that, for t > t\u2217 , we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd(t + 1)\n.\nb(t) \u2265 (kzt k\u221e + 1) y(t) + c(t)\nd(t)\nWorking backwards to step t\u2217 + 1, we get\nX\n\nvt (i) \u2264 c(t\u2217 )d(t\u2217 + 1).\n\nt>t\u2217\n\n14\n\n\fWe have written\nw(i) = h(1)d(1) + . . . + h(t\u2217 \u2212 1)d(t\u2217 \u2212 1) + x(t\u2217 )d(t\u2217 ) + pd(t\u2217 + 1)\nw(j) = h(1)d(1) + . . . + h(t\u2217 \u2212 1)d(t\u2217 \u2212 1) + y(t\u2217)d(t\u2217 ) + qd(t\u2217 + 1)\nwith p, q \u2208 [\u2212c(t\u2217 ), c(t\u2217 )]. Thus we see {w(i), w(j)} is indeed a point in G,\nin the (t\u2217 )th level.\nTo wrap up this argument, we need only take b(t) to be the maximum of\nthe lower bounds seen, over all choices of i and j.\nFinally, showing the points are distinct is simple. Since zt\u2217 (i) = 0 and\nzt\u2217 (j) = 1, we see that w(i) involves x(t\u2217 ), while w(j) involves y(t\u2217 ). Since\nthe grid is proper, the values w(i) and w(j) must be distinct. \u0003\nCorollary 4.4 Let A satisfy the strong graph columns condition. Then\nAx = 0 is graph-regular.\nProof:\nLet c be the vector given in Lemma 4.3, and let r \u2208 N be a\nnumber of colors.\u0001 We claim that, if Q \u2265 Q(r, c) from Lemma 4.2, then any\nr-coloring of [Q]\nwill contain a solution to Ax = 0 so that the values {x(i)}\n2\nare distinct, and the edges {x(i), x(j)} are monochromatic.\nIndeed, by Lemma 4.2, viewing \u03c7 as an r-coloring of [Q] \u00d7 [Q] (minus\nthe diagonal), we find a monochromatic Gridn of distinct points, with size at\nleast c. By Lemma 4.3, this Gridn contains a solution to Ax = 0 as desired.\n\u0003\n\n5\n\nHypergraph-regular equations\n\nThere is a natural extension of graph-regularity to the hypergraph Ramsey\ntheorem.\nUnfortunately, this extension is not fruitful. Say a homogeneous linear\nequation is \"r-graph-regular\" if, for every coloring of the r-sets of N, it has\na monochromatic solution by distinct numbers. As with graphs, when considering an r-uniform hypergraph, we require the equations to have at least\nr + 1 variables, or else every solution will be trivially monochromatic.\nTheorem 5.1 For r \u2265 3, no homogeneous linear equation of at least r + 1\nvariables is r-graph-regular for r-uniform hypergraphs.\n15\n\n\fProof:\nWe show the result for r = 3, and suggest the appropriate modifications for higher r.\nAssume each ai is nonzero, since discarding trivial variables only makes\nit easier to be graph-regular.\n\u0001\n(3)\nFor any n, define an (n + 1)-coloring fn of Nr by\n\uf8f1\nif x = y = z\n\uf8f2 blue\nmin{x, y, z} if one of x, y, z is smallest\nfn(3) (an + x, bn + y, cn + z) =\n\uf8f3\nmax{x, y, z} otherwise,\n\nwhere x, y, z \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1}. Similar to before, any set of four elements\nwhich is monochromatic under this coloring\nmust be blue.\n\u0001\n(3)\nN\nNow, for a prime p, define gp on r by\n\uf8f1 (3)\n\uf8f2 fp\u22121 (a, b, c) if i = j = k\ngp(3) (pi a, pj b, pk c) =\nred\nif one of i, j, k is smallest\n\uf8f3\ngreen\notherwise,\n\nwhere a, b, c are not divisible by p. Again, similar to before, any monochromatic clique under this coloring on at least four points must be red or blue.\nThe proof of Lemma 3.1 now applies unchanged to show that the coefficients\nof a hypergraph-regular equation\nPmust sum to zero. P\nai = 0.\nTherefore, we only consider ki=1 ai xi = 0 where\nDefine a new coloring, hp (x, y, z) = gp (y \u2212 x, z \u2212 x), where x < y < z,\nand gp is the graph-coloring used in Section 3.1.\nP\nSuppose x1 , . . . , xk are distinct values satisfying\nai xi = 0, with the\nhyperedges among them monochromatic\nP - either red or blue. Let xj be the\nsmallest of these values. Since aj = \u2212 i6=j ai , we see that\nX\nai (xi \u2212 xj ) = 0.\ni6=j\n\nBy choice of xj , we see that {xi \u2212 xj }i6=j is monochromatic under\nP gp . As\nbefore, a red clique means some ai is 0. If the clique is blue, then i6=j ai = 0,\nmeaning aj = 0. Since none of the coefficients are 0, we have reached a\ncontradiction. Thus no homogeneous linear equation in at least 4 variables\nis hypergraph-regular under colorings of 3-sets.\nFor a general r-uniform hypergraph with r > 3, one can easily modify the\n(3)\n(r)\ndefinition of gp to find a suitable gp , which will force coefficients to add to\n16\n\n\fzero. Likewise, one may define a coloring similar to hp which is built upon\n(r\u22121)\ngp\n, which will force one of the coefficients to be zero. These two colorings\ntogether will avoid solutions to any equation in at least r + 1 variables. \u0003\nEvidently, the ability to color 3-sets (or higher) of integers is too strong to\npermit monochromatic solutions to homogeneous linear equations. Is there\na better definition for an equation to be r-graph-regular which allows some\nequations to meet it, or is this the end of the story?\n\nReferences\n[1] W. Deuber, D. S. Gunderson, N.
