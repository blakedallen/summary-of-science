Second epoch observations with SINFONI on\nthe VLT, however, showed that it is most probably a background star. With\nIRAC on Spitzer we also found no indications of cool, very low mass companions\nin our sample of field white dwarfs. The implications of these non-detections are\nbriefly discussed.\n\n1.\n\nPlanets around White Dwarfs?\n\nSince the discovery of the first extrasolar planet by Mayor & Queloz (1995)\nthe number of known extrasolar planets has grown to more than 200. Most\ndiscoveries are based on measurements of radial velocities of stellar lines. Due\nto the great contrast in optical brightness between the main sequence star and\nits planet(s) no planet has so far been seen directly in the optical range. A much\nbetter spectral contrast between an extrasolar giant planet (EGP) and a star can\nbe achieved in the IR band, where the planet's thermal emission peaks. Indeed,\nrecently Chauvin et al. (2005) published an image of what seems to be the first\nEGP outside our solar system (albeit in a very wide orbit) around the brown\ndwarf 2MASSW J1207334-393254 obtained in the infrared with VLT/NACO.\nNeuh\u00e4user et al. (2005) detected a substellar mass object around the T Tauri\nstar GQ Lup, also using VLT/NACO, and determined a mass between 1 and 42\nJupiter masses. The contrast can be increased further if one searches for planets\naround white dwarfs, which are about a factor of ten smaller than giant planets\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFriedrich et al.\n\nand typically 103 to 104 times less luminous than main sequence solar-type stars\nof spectral type G or K (see e.g. Burleigh et al. 2002).\nWhile planets closer than 3\u20135 AU will probably not survive the post-mainsequence evolution and will migrate inwards and merge (Livio & Soker 1983),\nplanets farther away should survive and adiabatically migrate outwards. Their\nsemimajor axis will increase by a factor Minitial /Mfinal as the central star loses\nmass (Duncan & Lissauer 1998; Burleigh et al. 2002). The detection of a brown\ndwarf that survived the engulfment by the envelope of a red giant star and\nmigrated inwards (Maxted et al. 2006) is a fascinating discovery in this context\nand goes to show that brown dwarfs in close orbits around white dwarfs can\nexist.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\nHST\n\nThe seven single white dwarfs in the Hyades (HZ4, LB227, VR7, VR16, HZ7,\nHZ14, LP475-242) have been observed with HST/NICMOS in 2003 at two roll\nangles separated by 20 degrees through the F110W and F160W filters. Two and\nfour dithered frames, respectively, of 320s integration time each were recorded\nfor each roll angle and each target in these filters, which corresponds to a total\nof one and two orbits of HST time per target, respectively. The single dithered\nframes were reduced using the HST pipeline, then oversampled by a factor two\nusing cubic spline before registration and a FFT-shift based combination for\neach roll angle. In each filter, the resulting frames corresponding to different\nroll angles were subtracted from each other (see Friedrich et al. 2005 for details).\nThe results obtained for HZ7 are presented in Fig. 1 as an example.\n2.2.\n\nSpitzer\n\nObservations were performed with the Spitzer IRAC camera during a period of\ntwo months from September to November 2005. The nine white dwarfs chosen\nsupplemented already performed or ongoing programs of similar queries; they\nare nearby (< 30 pc) and younger than 3 Gyrs (cooling plus main sequence\nage). With this information mid-IR fluxes of accompanying planets with 1\u2013\n10MJup and the expected photometric excess can be predicted with models of\nBaraffe et al. (2003). Since these calculations do not include thermal insolation\nby or reflected light from the parent star they could thus be regarded as lower\nlimits. Hence it follows that these Spitzer data achieve limits of 3\u201310 MJUP .\nWith standard software packages we processed Basic Calibrated Data (BCD)\nand Post-Basic Calibrated Data (PBCD) and determined fluxes and magnitudes\nof our target stars. According to their effective temperatures a black body correction was applied (Reach et al. 2005) and an aperture correction for an aperture\nof 5 pixel radius on source determined (Reach et al. 2005). Color correction\nintroduces flux changes of about 1\u20132%, aperture correction changes of about\n5\u20137% depending on the channel. Some of the targets could not be detected in\nchannel 4. Flux errors for channel 1 and 2 are on the 1% level, in channel 3\nbetween 2% and 4% and in channel 4 between 5% and 7% with two exceptions,\n\n\fSearch for Giant Planets around White Dwarfs\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. The HST/NICMOS observations of HZ7 at two different roll angles and the result of their subtractions in the F110W filter (upper panel)\nand the F160W filter (lower panel). The field of view is about 2.\u2032\u2032 75 \u00d7 2.\u2032\u2032 75\n(0.\u2032\u2032 0215 pixel size). Maximum cuts are at 2% of the peak intensity for the\nobservations, and \u00b10.5% for the subtracted frames\n\nwhere uncertainties in channel 4 are 14% and 18%, respectively. The reason can\nbe found in a higher background level.\n2.3.\n\nVLT\n\nIn 2004 two field white dwarfs were observed with VLT and NACO in the H\nband. Close to one of our targets a second object was found at 0.\u2032\u2032 5 separation\n(see Zinnecker et al. 2006). If both objects were physically related, this would\ncorrespond to a separation of 25 AU at a distance of 50 pc. The measured absolute H magnitude of 13.7 mag at an estimated age of 0.5 Gyr yields a mass\nof 33MJup (Baraffe et al. 2003). Therefore a second epoch observation was performed in August 2006 with VLT and SINFONI in order to obtain information\nabout common proper motion and the near-infrared spectrum of the putative\ncompanion in the H- and K-band. Standard reduction was used to produce the\nimage vs. wavelength data cube.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\nHST\n\nWe validated the method used in the data reduction through simulations. For\nthis purpose a fake companion of given brightness was introduced in each frame\nas a scaled version of the target, adding the appropriate noise, and checking\nthat we could detect the signature of the companion after all reduction steps\ndescribed above. Fig. 2 shows the results of such a simulation for both filters and\nthe same target as in Fig. 1, with a planet at 0.\u2032\u2032 4 separation and 6 magnitudes\n\n\f4\n\nFriedrich et al.\n\ndifference in brightness. One can easily notice the pair of negative and positive\nimages of the companion at the given position (roll angle) from the WD-star\nin the subtracted frame. Such a simulation allows us to estimate the limiting\nbrightness ratio as a function of separation and given SNR of the detection.\nAccording to the COND models of Baraffe et al. (2003), the limiting mass of\nthe planetary mass companions that we are able to detect is typically about 10\nJupiter masses at 0.\u2032\u2032 5 separation (see Fig. 3 in Friedrich et al. 2005).\n\nFigure 2. Same as Fig. 1 but with an artificial planetary mass companion\nadded (6 mag brightness difference, 0.\u2032\u2032 4 separation)\n\n3.2.\n\nSpitzer\n\nFor all white dwarfs, fluxes measured in the four IRAC channels were compared\nto black body fluxes of respective temperatures normalized to the V magnitude.\nWe are aware that the black body flux will overestimate the white dwarf flux\nin the mid-IR, however, a flux excess in Channel 1 and 2 due to a substellar\nobject near the white dwarf would be recognizable in any case. No excess flux\nwas found for any observed white dwarf in any IRAC channel. As an example\nwe show the results for a DA and a DQ white dwarf from our sample in Fig. 3.\n3.3.\n\nVLT\n\nIn the 2004 and the 2006 observations the position of the white dwarf and\nits putative companion were measured relative to a \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 9 away faint (H \u223c\n20.7) source detected at both epochs, most probably a field star. Whereas the\napparent motion of the white dwarf with respect to that object is consistent\nwith its known proper-motion, the nearby object does not show any significant\nrelative motion relative to the latter (Fig. 4). We therefore conclude that it\nis not physically related to the white dwarf. Furthermore, its spectrum is not\nconsistent with it being a very cool object.\n\n\f5\n\nSearch for Giant Planets around White Dwarfs\n\nFigure 3. Comparison of white dwarf and black body fluxes in the four\nIRAC channels at 3.6\u03bcm, 4.5\u03bcm, 5.8\u03bcm, and 8.0\u03bcm for WD2007\u2212219 (DA)\nand WD1639+537 (DQ).

D. Scholz, private communication).\n\n\f6\n4.\n\nFriedrich et al.\nDiscussion\n\nUsing available telescopes and focal instruments for infrared observations from\nground and space, several surveys for planets around white dwarfs were performed. Kilic et al. (2006), who observed 18 cool white dwarfs, as well as Farihi\net al. (2005) who performed a proper motion and flux excess survey of 261\nwhite dwarfs, did not find any evidence for brown dwarfs or planets. Debes et\nal. (2006), who included the result from our Hyades observation (Friedrich et\nal. 2005), concluded that the upper limit for planets with masses higher than\n10MJup at separations larger than 23 AU is about 7%. So we can ask: Where\nare the planets? First of all, it must be said that the number of white dwarfs in\nsurveys sensitive to planetary mass objects, although of the order of 100, is still\nsmall and that surveys are still sensitivity limited such that 1MJup planets cannot be detected. Nevertheless it appears that either massive Jupiter-like planets\nin wide orbits around 3\u20134 M\u2299 main sequence progenitor stars are not common,\nthat planets do not survive the post-main sequence evolution or that massive\nJupiter-like planets do not remain bound due to planet-planet perturbations\n(Debes & Sigurdsson 2002).\nAcknowledgments.
