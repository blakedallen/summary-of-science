INTRODUCTION\nA mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop wireless network, a temporary and without\ninfrastructure in which the nodes can move randomly. These MANETS are able to extend their\nwireless transmission range of each node by multi-hop packet forwarding. So these MANETS\nare suited for the situations in which pre deployed infrastructure support is not available. An ad\nhoc network doesn't have any fixed infrastructure like base stations or mobile switching centers.\nMobile nodes which are within the radio range to each other can communicate directly through\nwireless links, whereas the nodes which are far away depend on other nodes to communicate\nmessages as routers. In an ad hoc network the node mobility causes frequent changes of the\nnetwork topology. Mobile ad hoc networks have their applications in both military and civilian\ncircumstances due to their self-organizing and self-configuring potentials.\nThe routing aspects of MANETs are discussed earlier, while the research activities about\nsecurity in MANETs are in their beginning stage. Apart from the regular network problems\nMANETs creates new security problems. Ad hoc networks use all the available nodes for\nrouting and forwarding to increase the throughput of the total network. Therefore when more\n\n10.5121/ijwmn.2010.2202\n\n16\n\n\fnodes participate in packet routing, it increases the total bandwidth and decreases the possible\nrouting paths and also the possibility of network partition.\nWhen a node is overloaded, selfish, malicious or broken it may misbehave by not approving to\nforward packets. An overloaded node does not have the CPU cycles, buffer space or available\nnetwork bandwidth to forward packets. A selfish node expects other nodes to forward packets\nbecause it is not willing and does not have direct interest to spend its battery life, CPU cycles or\navailable network bandwidth to forward packets. A malicious node introduces a denial of\nservice attack by dropping packets. A broken node prevents it from forwarding packets by\nhaving a software fault.\nThe mobile ad hoc network needs more security mechanisms than in fixed networks. Through\nthe compromised nodes attackers can interrupt into the network. When the nodes join or leave\nthe network, and roam in the network often, then the network topology becomes highly\ndynamic. Mobile users request security services when they move from one place to another due\nto its dynamic nature. To achieve protection and high network performance, a powerful security\nsolution is needed, otherwise\n\u2022\n\nThe security system may misbehave when an attacker infiltrates the security system.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe network performance may be degraded by the misbehavior of the nodes.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe malicious nodes can work as routers and stops the network from delivering the\npackets correctly when they are not protected properly.\n\nFor example, the malicious node can declare faulty routing updates which are spread through all\nover the network or it may drop the packets which are passing across them. A very important\nsecurity issue in ad hoc network is to protect the operations of their network layer from\nmalicious attacks. In a distributed computer systems, there are lot of familiar attacks which\ninclude\n\u2022\n\nDenial of Service: Due to overload or malfunction the network service is not available\n\n\u2022\n\nInformation theft: Through an illegal instance, information is read.\n\n\u2022\n\nIntrusion: Through an unauthorized person, access is achieved to some restricted\nservice.\n\n\u2022\n\nTampering: Through an unauthorized person, the modification is achieved.\n\nIn this paper, we propose to develop a Lightweight and Attack Resistant Authenticated Routing\nProtocol (LARARP) for mobile ad hoc networks, which will mitigate the routing misbehavior of\nnodes in mobile ad hoc networks.\nThe protocol involves:\n\u2022\n\nThe destination node authenticates the source node\n\n\u2022\n\nThe destination node authenticates every intermediate node listed in the packet header\n\n17\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThe source and destination node confirm the correctness of node's sequence in the node\nlist\n\n\u2022\n\nWell behaving nodes are rewarded by more credits and misbehaving nodes are\npunished by reducing the credits\n\n2. RELATED WORK\nFarooq Anjum et al. [1] proposed an initial approach to detect the intrusions in ad hoc networks.\nIn this work, the network activities are observed by the signature based IDS and compares them\nwith the known attacks. The new unknown threats cannot be detected is the limitation of this\napproach.\nAnand Patwardhan et al. [2] proposed a secure routing protocol based on AODV over IPv6. In\nadditional to this, by the routing protocol independent Intrusion Detection and Response system\nfor ad hoc networks it is reinforced.\nYih-Chun Hu et al [3] have designed and estimated a secure ad hoc network protocol called\nSecure Efficient Ad hoc Distance vector routing protocol (SEAD). It is based on the design of\nthe Destination-sequence Distance-vector routing protocol (DSDV). They have used the\nefficient one way hash functions without using an asymmetric cryptographic operation in the\nprotocols in order to support the node usage with limited CPU processing capability and also to\nprotect against the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks where the attacker attempts to cause other\nnodes to use more network bandwidth or processing time. SEAD are tested in various ranges of\nsituations and performed well. For the multiple uncoordinated attackers creating incorrect\nrouting state in other nodes, and also in the active attackers or compromised nodes in the\nnetwork, SEAD is robust.\nTarag Fahad et al. [4] have proposed a new mechanism, Packet Conservation Monitoring\nAlgorithm (PCMA) by focusing on the detection phase. This is used to detect the selfish nodes\nin MANETs. It does not show other threats because these protocols address the issue of packet\nforwarding attacks.\nYih Chun Hu et al. [5] have presented the attacks against routing in ad hoc networks and\nestimated the performance of a secure on demand ad hoc network routing protocol called\nAriadne. The corruption of the uncompromised routes which consists of the uncompromised\nnodes by the attackers or compromised nodes was prevented by Ariadne. It is also used to\nprevent the Denial of Service attacks. Moreover, Ariadne is effective and uses only the highly\nefficient symmetric cryptographic primitives.\nPanagiotis Papadimitratos and Zygmunt J. Haas [6] have discussed about the Secure Routing\nProtocol (SRP) counters. Its malicious behavior brings the discovery of the topological\ninformation. An irregularly misbehaving attacker is first conforming to the route discovery to\nmake itself as a part of route, and then corrupt the in-transit data. With the help of the Secure\nMessage Transmission Protocol (SMT), protection of data transmission has been given. This\nprovides a flexible, end to end secure data forwarding scheme which naturally complements\nSRP. The processing overhead due to the cryptographic operations remains low. This allows the\nprotocol to remain competitive to reactive protocols which do not incorporate the security\nfeatures.\n\n18\n\n\fYanchao Zhang et al [7] have proposed a credit based Secure Incentive Protocol (SIP) for\nsimulating the cooperation in packet forwarding for MANETs without infrastructure. It does not\nshow other threats because these protocols address the issue of packet forwarding attacks.\nLiu et al. [8] have proposed a 2ACK scheme which works as an add-on technique for routing\nmethods for detecting the routing misbehavior and to reduce the adverse effect. The unnecessary\noverhead is resulted by sending the acknowledgement packets even if there is no misbehavior.\nLi Zhao et al. [9] have proposed a new method MARS and its enhancement E-MARS for\ndetecting the misbehavior and to reduce the adverse effect in adhoc networks, they. In this\nmethod, the information packets are prevented to reach the destination by a route failure or link\nfailure. In additional to this, the destination may not be able to detect the misbehavior when a\nselfish node does not forward the information packet or modifies the contents of the information\npackets.\nPatwardhan et al. [10] have presented their method in securing a MANET with the help of the\nthreshold-based intrusion detection system and a secure routing protocol. A proof of concept\nexecution has been presented for their IDS organized on handheld devices and also in a\nMANET testbed which is connected by a secured version of AODV over IPv6-SecAODV.The\nattacks on the data traffics are detected by the IDS. SecAODV is used for the security features\nof non-repudiation and authentication without depending upon the Certificate Authority (CA) or\nKey Distribution Center (KDC) availability. The design and implementation details of their\nsystem, the practical considerations involved and the working of these mechanisms which are\nused to detect and prevent the malicious attacks are presented by them.\nHuaizhi Li and Mukesh Singhal [11] have presented an on-demand secure routing protocol for\nad hoc networks which is based on a distributed authentication mechanism. In order to establish\na trust relationship between the network entities, this protocol has made use of the\nrecommendation and trust evaluation and also it uses the feedback to adjust it. Without the third\nparty support it discovers the multiple routes between two nodes.\nSergio Marti, et al., has explained two techniques which improves the throughput in an adhoc\nnetwork. In order to reduce the effects of routing misbehavior in adhoc networks such as\nwatchdog and path rater, they have examined two possible extensions to DSR. The misbehaving\nnodes are identified by the watchdog and the path rater assists the routing protocol to avoid the\nmisbehaving nodes [12].\nKatrin Hoeper and Guang Gong have introduced two full functional identity-based\nauthentication and key exchange methods for mobile adhoc networks. For IBC (Identity-based\ncryptographic) schemes they have presented the first key revocation and key renewing\nalgorithms. For designing MANET-IDAKE schemes they have used some features of IBC\nschemes like pre shared secret keys from the pairings and efficient key management which\nmeets the special constraints and the requirements of MANETs [13].\nGergely Acs et, al. [14] have proposed a mathematical framework in which security is defined\nexactly and it has proved that the routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks to be secure\nexactly. For the on demand source routing protocols they have modified their framework but the\ngeneral principles are applicable to the other protocols. Their approach is used based on the\nsimulation paradigm which is widely used to examine the key establishment protocols. But still\nit is not applied in the situations like ad hoc routing. They proposed an on demand source\nrouting protocol called as endairA. They have also proved that their framework is secured and\nestablished it's utility.\n\n19\n\n\fSyed Rehan Afzal et al. [15] have determined the security problems and attacks in existing\nrouting protocols. In order to remove the problems which are mentioned in the existing\nprotocols, they have presented the design and analysis of a secure on demand routing protocol\ncalled RSRP. In addition, RSRP is different than Ariadne and uses an effective broadcast\nauthentication mechanism without clock synchronization and helps the instant authentication.\n\n3. SYSTEM DESIGN AND ALGORITHM OVERFLOW\nIn this paper, we propose a Lightweight and Attack Resistant Authenticated Routing protocol\n(LARARP). An effective security is given by our protocol for the route discovery attacks in the\nMANET routing protocols. It helps the nodes to drop the invalid packets earlier by detecting the\nmalicious node quickly.\nIn our proposed protocol, before transmitting the data to the destination the sender generates a\ntemporary key pair. A secret key list SS and public key PS are present in the key pair. In order\nto generate the secret list SS0, SS1, it uses the concept of one-way hash function. The public\nkey PS can be created by hashing every element of the SSi. The public key PS is sent to the\nrespective destinations by the sender after this key generation. Then the verification information\nis created by the source using the SS list. The verification information and broadcasted in the\nroute request packet. Each intermediate node will check the verification of the source by\nreceiving the route request packet, using its PS. The packet will be discarded if the verification\nfails else it will be forwarded.\nThe destination will check the validity of the verification of the source when the route request\nreaches the destination. It discards the packet if it fails.\nA MAC based authentication code is used for the reliability of route request packet. If there is\nany modification in the content of the route request packet including verification information by\nthe intermediate node, then it is detected by the destination node by checking the MAC code\nusing its public key. It discards the packet if it gets modified. The route reply packet is\ntransmitted by the destination node. The same steps of the route request packet are repeated for\nthe reply packet.\nIn addition to this, our proposed protocol presents a credit based incentive scheme to punish and\nreward the misbehaving and well behaving nodes respectively. It is a natural idea to encourage\ncooperation among selfish nodes by rewarding them with some credits. Only when a node has\nenough credits in hand, it could transmit its own packets.\nWe have taken the AODV routing protocol as the base and modified according to the proposed\nprotocol.\n\n3.1. General Attacks on Ad Hoc Network Routing Protocols\nAd hoc network routing protocol attack usually lies in any of these two categories: routing\ndisruption attacks and resource consumption attacks. The attacker makes effort to cause\nreasonable data packets to be routed in dysfunctional ways in the routing disruption attack. The\nattacker inserts packets into the network in order to consume precious network resources\nbandwidth, or node resources such as memory (storage) or computation power in the resource\nconsumption attack. Both attacks are the example for a Denial-of-service (DoS) attack by\nviewing through an application layer.\nIf the attacker sends fake routing packets to create routing loop which causes the packets to\ncross the nodes in a cycle without reaching their target, consuming energy and available\nbandwidth is the best example of a routing disruption attack.\n\n20\n\n\fSimilarly the attacker can also create a routing black hole; the packets are dropped in this by\nsending fake routing packets. The attacker can also route all packets for some destination to\nitself and then it can discard them or the attacker can also make of all the nodes in an area of the\nnetwork to point \"into\" that area even if the destination is outside the area.\nAn attacker may create a gray hole as a special case of black hole in which it drops only some\nselected packets. For example, forwarding the routing packets but not the data packets. An\nattacker may also take effort to cause a node to use diversion (suboptimal routes) or by inserting\nthe fake routing packets to makes effort to divide the network in order to prevent one set of\nnodes from reaching the other.\nIf the attacker makes effort to create a route to look longer by itself through adding virtual nodes\nto the route, then this attack is called as gratuitous detour where the shorter route does not exist.\nThe rushing attack is a malicious attack which is targeted against the on-demand protocol which\nuses duplicate suppression at each node. Throughout the network the attacker distributes\nROUTE REQUESTS quickly by holding back any reasonable ROUTE REQUESTS, while the\nnodes drop them due to duplicate suppression.\nIf an attacker injects extra data packets to the networks which use bandwidth resources when\nforwarded particularly to over charge or routing loops, is the best example of a resource\nconsumption attack.\nLikewise the attacker can also inject extra control packets to the network which uses still more\nbandwidth or computational resources in which the other nodes process and forward such\npackets. An Active-VC attacker can try to take out more resources from the nodes on both sides\nthe vertex cut by using either of these attacks. For example, the nodes wastes the energy by\nforwarding packets to the vertex cut which is to be dropped is achieved through forwarding\nonly the routing packets but not the data packets.\n\n3.2. Incentive Scheme\nAn additional data structure called Neighbor's Trust Counter Table (NTT) is maintained by\neach network node. Let {CC1, CC2,...} be the initial trust counters of the nodes {N1, N2,...}\nalong the route from a source S to the destination D.\nSince the node does not have any information about the reliability of its neighbors in the\nbeginning, nodes can neither be fully trusted nor be fully distrusted. When a source S wants to\nsend a packet to the destination D, it sends route request (RREQ) packets.\nEach node keeps track of the number of packets it has forwarded through a route using a credit\ncounter (CC). Each time, when node Nk receives a packet from a node Ni, then Nk increases\nthe credit counter of node Ni as\nCCNi = CCNi + 1, i =1, 2......\n\n(1)\n\nThen the NTT of node Nk is modified with the values of CCNi. Similarly each node determines\nits NTT and finally the packets reach the destination D. When the subsequent RREQ message\nreaches the destination, it checks the credit values of the intermediate nodes, before verifying\ntheir digital signature. The nodes are considered as well behaving nodes if the credit values are\nequal or greater than a credit threshold Ct. On the other hand, the nodes are considered as\nmisbehaving nodes if the credit values are less than Ct. The verifications of the digital signature\nare made only to the misbehaving nodes instead of verifying all the nodes, which reduces the\n\n21\n\n\fcontrol overhead. Also nodes with credit counter values less than Ct are prohibited from further\ntransmissions.\nThe source will be considered as a route breakage or failure, if it does not receives the RREP\npacket for a time period of t seconds. Then the route discovery process is started by the source\nagain.\n\n3.3. Route Discovery Process\nIn the proposed protocol, once a node S want to send a packet to a destination node D, it\ninitiates the route discovery process by constructing a route request RREQ packet. It contains\nthe source and destination ids and a request id, which is generated randomly and a MAC\ncomputed over the request id with a key shared by the sender and the destination.\nWhen an intermediate node receives the RREQ packet for the first time, it appends its id to the\nlist of node ids and signs it with a key which is shared with the destination. It then forwards the\nRREQ to its neighbors.\nLet N1, N2....Nm-1 nodes are there, between the source S and the destination D.\nThe route request process is illustrated as below:\nS\n\nN1\n\nRREQ: [S, D, MAC (Rid), MAC (CCN1),\n(N1), signN1]\n\nN1\n\nN2\n\nRREQ: [S, D, MAC (Rid)]\n\nN2\n\nRREQ: [S, D, MAC (Rid),\nMAC (CCN1, CCN2), (N1, N2), (signN1, signN2)]\nN3\n\nNm-1\n\nRREQ: [S, D, MAC (Rid),\nMAC (CCN1,.. CCNm-1), (N1,... Nm-1),\n(signN1, ...signNm-1)]\n\nD\n\nFigure 2: Route Request Process\n\n22\n\n\fWhen the destination receives the accumulated RREQ message, it first verifies the credit values\nof the intermediate nodes and then the sender's request id by recomputing the sender's MAC\nvalue, with its shared key. It then verifies the digital signature of each intermediate node. With\nthe credit values of the intermediate nodes, the threshold Ct is compared to detect the\nmisbehaving node. If all these verifications are successful, then the destination generates a route\nreply message RREP. If the verifications fail, then the RREQ is discarded by the destination. It\nagain constructs a MAC on the request id with the key shared by the sender and the destination.\nThe RREP contains the source and destination ids, The MAC of the request id, the accumulated\nroute from the RREQ, which are digitally signed by the destination. The RREP is sent towards\nthe source on the reverse route.\nWhen the intermediate node receives the RREP packet, it checks whether its id is in the list of\nids stored by the RREP. It also checks for the ids of its neighbors in the list.\nThe intermediate node then verifies the digital signature of the destination node stored in the\nRREP packet, is valid. If the verification fails, then the RREP packet is dropped. Otherwise, it is\nsigned by the intermediate node and forwarded to the next node in the reverse route.\nWhen the source receives the RREP packet, if first verifies that the first id of the route stored by\nthe RREP is its neighbor. If it is true, then it verifies all the digital signatures of the intermediate\nnodes, in the RREP packet. If all these verifications are successful, then the source accepts the\nroute. The source also verifies the request id that it sent along with RREQ packet. If it received\nback the same request id from the destination, it means that there is no replay attack.\nThe route reply process is illustrated as below:\n\nD\n\nN2\n\nN1\n\nRREP: [S, D, MAC (Rid),\n(N1, N2,.....Nm-1),(SignD)]\n\nNm-1\n\nRREP: [S, D, MAC (Rid), (N1, N2...Nm-1),\n(SignD, signNm-1,...signN2)]\n\nRREP: [S, D, MAC (Rid), (N1, N2...Nm-1),\n(signD, signNm-1,...signN2, signN1)]\n\nN1\n\nS\n\nFigure 3: Route Reply Process\nIn this protocol, authentication is performed for both route request and route reply operations.\nAlso, only nodes which are stored in the current route need to perform these cryptographic\ncomputations. So the proposed protocol is efficient and more secure.\n\n23\n\n\f4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\n4.1 Simulation Model and Parameters\nWe use NS2 to simulate our proposed algorithm. In our simulation, the channel capacity of\nmobile hosts is set to the same value: 2 Mbps. We use the distributed coordination function\n(DCF) of IEEE 802.11 for wireless LANs as the MAC layer protocol. It has the functionality to\nnotify the network layer about link breakage.\nIn our simulation, 100 mobile nodes move in a 1000 meter x 1000 meter square region for 50\nseconds simulation time. We assume each node moves independently with the same average\nspeed. All nodes have the same transmission range of 250 meters. In our simulation, the\nminimal speed is 5 m/s and maximal speed is 10 m/s. The simulated traffic is Constant Bit Rate\n(CBR).\nOur simulation settings and parameters are summarized in the following table:\nTable 1: Default Simulation Parameters\nParameters\n\nAssumptions\n\nNo. of Nodes\n\n100\n\nArea Size\n\n1000 X 1000\n\nMac\n\n802.11\n\nRadio Range\n\n250m\n\nSimulation Time\n\n50 sec\n\nTraffic Source\n\nCBR\n\nPacket Size\n\n512\n\nSpeed\n\n5m/s t 10m/s\n\nMisbehaving Nodes\n\n5,10,15,20, 25\n\nPause time\n\n10,20,30,40, 50\n\n4.2 Performance Metrics\nWe evaluate mainly the performance according to the following metrics.\nControl overhead: The control overhead is defined as the total number of routing control packets\nnormalized by the total number of received data packets.\nAverage end-to-end delay: The end-to-end-delay is averaged over all surviving data packets\nfrom the sources to the destinations.\nAverage Packet Delivery Ratio: It is the ratio of the number of packets received successfully\nand the total number of packets transmitted.\n\nThe simulation results are presented in the next section. We compare our LARARP with\nthe SAODV [14] protocol in presence of malicious node environment.\n\n24\n\n\f5.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has presented the design and evaluation of a (LARARP), a new ad hoc network\nrouting protocol that provides security against routing misbehaviors and attacks. It relies on\ncryptographic techniques for authentication. The design is based on the AODV routing protocol.\nOur protocol supports the nodes to drop the invalid packets earlier by detecting the malicious\nnodes quickly by verifying the digital signatures of all the intermediate nodes. It punishes the\nmisbehaving nodes by decrementing a credit counter and rewards the well behaving nodes by\nincrementing the credit counter. Thus it prevents uncompromised nodes from attacking the\nroutes with malicious or compromised nodes It also prevents a variety of denial-of-service\n(DoS) attacks. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of\nLARARP. By comparing with the existing scheme, we have shown that the proposed protocol\nattains high packet delivery ratio with reduce delay and overhead.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers, whose comments and suggestions helped to\nimprove the presentation of this paper.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\nFarooq Anjum and Dhanant Subhadrabandhu and Saswati Sarkar \"Signature based Intrusion\nDetection for Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks: A Comparative study of various routing protocols\"\nVehicular Technology Conference, 2003.
