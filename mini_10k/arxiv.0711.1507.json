Introduction\nIn the absence of fundamental framework for non-equilibrium systems, one-dimensional\nmodels known as asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP), where particles\ninteract via an exclusion potential and hop along discrete lattices, have become\nimportant tools and references for understanding complex phenomena in chemistry,\nphysics and biology [1, 2]. ASEPs now are playing a role similar to the one the Ising\nmodel has in the studies of equilibrium systems [3]. Asymmetric exclusion processes\nhave been applied successfully to analyze the kinetics of biopolymerization [4], protein\nsynthesis [5, 6, 7], molecular transport through nanopores and channels [8], the motion\nof motor proteins along cytoskeleton filaments [9, 10, 11], growth of fungal filaments\n[12], and different aspects of car traffic processes [13, 14].\nMany non-equilibrium phenomena can be reasonable well described by a singlechannel exclusion models. However, the necessity to analyze more realistic complex\nphenomena, that involve the transport along the parallel coupled lattices and existence\nof internal states, e.g. for motor proteins, vehicular traffic and hopping of quantum\ndots, stimulated the development of multi-channel ASEPs [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. In\nthese models particle can move along their lattice and they also can transfer between the\nchannels. leading to complex dynamic behavior. Theoretical analysis of multi-channel\nexclusion processes indicates that a coupling between channels has a strong effect on\nparticle dynamics and stationary-state properties, and it also leads to several unusual\nphenomena, such as localized domain walls [20, 21, 22].\nDynamics of many non-equilibrium systems is strongly modified by the presence of\ninhomogeneities and defects. For example, it is known that in the protein synthesis\nthe elongation rate of ribosomes is not uniform due to slow codon sites on RNA\nmolecules [7, 23]. The effect of local inhomogeneities have been already investigated\nfor different ASEPs on single-chain lattices [6, 24, 25, 26]. However, for multi-channel\nASEPs mostly homogeneous systems have been considered. The aim of the present\npaper is to investigate two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous coupling between the\nlattices. Specifically, we analyze the simplest case when two channels are coupled at\nthe single lattice site far away from the boundaries, and two different cases, symmetric\nand asymmetric couplings, are considered. The problem is motivated by the cellular\ntransport of motor proteins that move along parallel protofilaments along microtubules\n[27]. Occasionally, motor proteins may jump between the chains, especially in the\npresence of structural defects in the original protofilament. In our study we use a simple\napproximate model for theoretical calculations of stationary-state properties and phase\ndiagrams, and we test our predictions by utilizing extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give a detailed description of the\nmodel, briefly present known results for single-chain ASEPs, and develop an approximate\ntheory for asymmetric exclusion processes involving two channels connected by a single\ncluster far away from the boundaries where particles can transfer with symmetric or\nasymmetric rates between the lattices. In section 3 we present and discuss Monte-Carlo\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\n3\n\ncomputer simulation results and compare them with theoretical predictions. Finally, in\nsection 4 we summarize and conclude.\n2. Theoretical description of two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous\ncoupling\n2.1. Model\nWe consider identical particles that move on two parallel one-dimensional lattices as\nillustrated in figure 1. Two channels are identical and they have L+1 sites. The particles\ninteract via hard-core exclusion potential: each site is either empty or occupied by a\nsingle particle. The dynamics of the system is random-sequential, i.e., at each time step\nwe randomly choose a site on one lattice to follow its dynamics. Particles can enter the\nsystem from the left with the rate 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1 if any of the first sites in either lattice\nare empty. Particles that reach the final site in either lattice can leave the system with\nthe rate 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 1. In the bulk of the system particles move from the site i to the site\ni + 1 on the same lattice with the rate 1 if the next site is available. However, dynamic\nrules are different at the special site L/2 + 1: see figure 1. A particle at this site on\nthe first lattice can move vertically to the site L/2 + 1 on the second lattice with the\nrate w1 if the corresponding site is empty, or it can hop to the right empty site with\nthe rate (1 \u2212 w1 ). However, if the site L/2 + 1 in the second channel is occupied, the\nparticle jumps in the horizontal direction to the right with the rate 1 if the forward site\nis available. The total transition rate out of this defect site is equal to one. Similarly,\nthe particle on the site L/2 + 1 on the second lattice can hop vertically with the rate w2\nif the upper site is free, or it can move horizontally with the rate (1 \u2212 w2 ) if the forward\nright site is not occupied. Otherwise, it will move to the right neighboring site with\nthe rate 1, assuming again that the forward site is available. When the transition rates\nbetween the channels are equal (w1 = w2 ) the coupling is symmetric, while for w1 6= w2\nthe coupling between the lattices is asymmetric. Both cases of two-channel ASEPs with\ninhomogeneous coupling are analyzed separately.\nIf the inter-channel hopping rates are equal to zero (w1 = w2 = 0) then we have\ntwo independent single-lane ASEPs for which exact solutions for all dynamic properties\nare already known [1]. There are three stationary-state phases. For large entrance and\nexit rates, \u03b1 > 1/2 and \u03b2 > 1/2, the single-lane ASEP is found to be in a maximal\ncurrent (MC) phase where the stationary current and bulk density are given by\n1\n1\n(1)\nJM C = , \u03c1bulk,M C = .\n4\n2\nFor \u03b1 < 1/2 and \u03b1 < \u03b2 the dynamics is determined by the entrance process and we\nhave a low-density (LD) phase where the particle current and the bulk density are\nJLD = \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1),\n\n\u03c1bulk,LD = \u03b1.\n\n(2)\n\nFinally, for \u03b2 < 1/2 and \u03b2 < \u03b1 the exiting is a rate-limiting process, and the single-chain\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\n1\n\nlane 2\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n\u03b1\n\n1 or 1\u2212 w2\n111\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n\n1\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nw\n\n1\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n\u03b2\n111\n000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n\nw1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n1111\n0000\n000\n0000111\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n0000111\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n0000111\n1111\n000\n111\n\nlane 1\n\n1 or 1\u2212 w1\n\nFigure 1. Schematic view of two-channel ASEP with a coupling at the single site.\nParticles move only along the lattices, except on the link site where they can hop to the\nother lane if the corresponding site is empty. The inter-channel transitions rates are\nw1 and w2 . Allowed transitions are shown by arrows. Entrance rates at both lattices\nare equal to \u03b1 and exit rates are equal to \u03b2.\n\nASEP is in a high-density (HD) phase where\nJHD = \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2),\n\n\u03c1bulk,HD = 1 \u2212 \u03b2.\n\n(3)\n\nSeveral approximate theoretical approaches have been developed for investigation\nof multi-channel ASEPs [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, probably the closest\ndescription of non-equilibrium dynamics, as judged by comparison with Monte Carlo\ncomputer simulations, is obtained in the mean-field model that have exact treatment\nof the vertical transitions between the channels [16, 20]. We adopt this strategy to\nanalyze the inhomogeneous coupling in two-channel ASEPs. The dynamics at the\ncoupling cluster can be specified by introducing functions Pij (i, j = 0, 1) that define\nthe probability that the vertical cluster is empty (P00 ), partially occupied [P10 or P01\nif the occupied site is on the lane 1 or 2, respectively], or fully occupied (P11 ). These\nprobabilities are related via a normalization condition\nP00 + P10 + P01 + P11 = 1.\n\n(4)\n\nIn the presented analysis we calculate only bulk densities in all phases, however, our\nanalysis can be easily applied to obtain full density profiles utilizing known results [1].\n2.2. Symmetric coupling\nLet us consider the case of the symmetric coupling when the vertical transitions rates\nare equal. As can be seen from figure 1, the vertical coupling cluster divides the\ntwo-channel inhomogeneous system into four homogeneous horizontal segments. Each\nof these segments can be viewed as a single-lane ASEP that are connected with the\n\n\f5\n\nInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\nvertical junction cluster, as shown in figure 2. We label left segments in the first and\nsecond channels as 1L and 2L, respectively. The particles enter these segments with\nthe rate \u03b1 and leave them with an effective rate \u03b2ef f . Similarly, 1R and 2R describe\nthe corresponding right segments with entrance and exit rates given by \u03b1ef f and \u03b2: see\nfigure 2. Because of the symmetry, the probability to have the partially filled vertical\ncluster with the particle on lane 1 or 2 is the same, P10 = P01 , which modifies the\nnormalization condition,\nP00 + 2P10 + P11 = 1.\n\n(5)\n\nThus dynamics in four segments and in the vertical cluster is treated exactly, but\ncorrelations between different parts are neglected.\n\n1\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2eff\n\nlane 2\n\n\u03b1eff\n\n\u03b2\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n1\n\n1\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\nlane 1\n\n11\n00\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n\nw\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1\n\nw\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n\u03b1 eff\n\nFigure 2. Effective scheme for two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous symmetric\ncoupling. The system consists of four segments coupled by a vertical junction cluster.\nEach segment is viewed as a single-chain ASEP. Allowed transitions are shown by\narrows.\n\nIt is instructive to analyze first the simplest case of strong symmetric coupling when\nw1 = w2 = 1. It can be shown that it is not possible to have a completely empty vertical\ncluster in the large-time limit, i.e., P00 = 0. The vertical configuration 00 can only be\nobtained from the partially filled cluster by particles leaving to segments 2L and and\n2R. However, the first particle to reach the junction cluster will hop vertically from\none defect site to the other constantly until another particle arrives to completely fill\nthe cluster. There is no possibility for creating empty vertical cluster. Then from the\nnormalization condition (5) one obtains,\n1 \u2212 P11\n.\n(6)\n2\nBecause from the vertical cluster particles can leave to the right part of the system\nonly from the completely filled configuration, the effective rate to enter the segments\n1R and 2R can be easily expressed in terms of the properties of the junction cluster,\nP10 =\n\n\u03b1ef f = P11 .\n\n(7)\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\n6\n\nThe effective exit rates from the left segments can also be found using similar arguments:\nthe particle can leave the segment 1L or 2L to the right if the vertical cluster is in the\npartially filled configuration, leading us to the following expression,\n1 \u2212 P11\n.\n(8)\n\u03b2ef f = P10 =\n2\nThis result has important consequences on the particle dynamics in the system. Since\n\u03b2ef f \u2264 1/2 the maximal-current phase cannot be realized in the left segments. Symmetry\nand conservation of the particle current also require that\nJ1L = J2L = J1R = J2R ,\n\n(9)\n\ni.e., fluxes through all segments are equal. Using the notation (x,y), where x and\ny denote the phase of the left and right segments respectively, we conclude that the\nonly possible stationary phases for this system are (HD,HD), (LD,HD), (LD,LD) and\n(HD,LD) phases.\nThe (HD,HD) phase might exist if the following conditions are satisfied,\n\u03b2 < 1/2,\n\n\u03b2ef f < 1/2,\n\n\u03b2ef f < \u03b1,\n\n\u03b2 < \u03b1ef f .\n\n(10)\n\nBecause the bulk densities in the left and right segments of this phase are the same, it\nimplies that\n\u03b2ef f = \u03b2.\n\n(11)\n\nThen from Eqs. (7) and (8) we derive that\n\u03b1ef f = 1 \u2212 2\u03b2.\n\n(12)\n\nSubstituting this expression into inequalities (10) we obtain, that (HD,HD) phase is\nrealized when\n1\n\u03b2 < \u03b1, \u03b2 < .\n(13)\n3\nSimilar arguments for (LD,LD) yield that this phase exists for\n1\n\u03b1 < \u03b2, \u03b1 < .\n(14)\n3\nThe conditions for existence of (HD,LD) phase can be written in the following form,\n\u03b1ef f < 1/2. \u03b2ef f < 1/2,\n\n\u03b1ef f < \u03b2,\n\n\u03b2ef f < \u03b1.\n\n(15)\n\nIn this phase the stationarity of the particle current requires that \u03b1ef f = \u03b2ef f , and\nutilizing Eqs. (7) and (8) it produces\n1\n(16)\n\u03b1ef f = \u03b2ef f = .\n3\nCombining this result with Eq. (15) we obtain that this phase exists only for\n\u03b1 > 1/3,\n\n\u03b2 > 1/3.\n\n(17)\n\nIt can also be shown that in this mean-field approximation that neglects the correlations\nbetween the segments the (LD,HD) phase correspond to the phase boundary\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 < 1/3.\n\n(18)\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\n7\n\nIn the general case of symmetric coupling between channels, when w1 = w2 = w \u2264\n1, the calculations become slightly more involved because the vertical configuration with\nboth empty sites now have a nonzero probability, i.e., P00 6= 0. The expressions for the\neffective entrance and exit rates are modified as\n\u03b2ef f = 1 \u2212 P11 \u2212 P10 ,\n\n\u03b1ef f = P11 + (1 \u2212 w)P10 .\n\n(19)\n\nAs in the case of strong symmetric coupling, the particle fluxes through all segments\nare the same, and it is impossible to have a maximal-current phase in the system. If\nMC would exist in one of the segments, than it would have to be found in all segments.\nThis would require that \u03b1ef f > 1/2 and \u03b2ef f > 1/2, leading to\n\u03b1ef f + \u03b2ef f > 1.\n\n(20)\n\nHowever, from Eq. (19) it follows that\n\u03b1ef f + \u03b2ef f = 1 \u2212 wP10 < 1,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich contradicts the inequality (20). Thus, our mean-field approach suggests that there\nare four possible stationary phases [(HD,HD), (LD,LD), (HD,LD) and (LD,HD)] in the\ntwo-channel ASEP with inhomogeneous symmetric coupling.\nLet us define functions \u03c1L1 and \u03c1L2 as probabilities to find the particle at the last\nsites of left segments 1L and 2L respectively. Similarly, \u03c1R\ni (i = 1, 2) gives the density at\nthe first sites of the right segments 2L and 2R. Because of the symmetry these functions\nare related,\n\u03c1L1 = \u03c1L2 = \u03c1L ,\n\nR\nR\n\u03c1R\n1 = \u03c12 = \u03c1 .\n\n(22)\n\nThe dynamics at the vertical cluster is described at all times by the master equation,\ndP11\n= \u03c1L (P01 + P10 ) \u2212 2P11 (1 \u2212 \u03c1R ),\n(23)\ndt\nwhich at steady state reduces to\n\u03c1L P10 = P11 (1 \u2212 \u03c1R ).\n\n(24)\n\nThe particle current that leaves any of the left segments can be written as\nJ = \u03b2ef f \u03c1L ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhile the flux entering any of right segments is given by\nJ = \u03b1ef f (1 \u2212 \u03c1R ).\n\n(26)\n\nCombining Eqs. (19), (24), (25) and (26), we derive the expression that relates the\nprobabilities of filled and partially filled vertical junction clusters,\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 w)P10\n+ 2P11 P10 + P11\n\u2212 P11 = 0.\n\nSolving this equation and eliminating the unphysical solution leads us to\np\nP11 [1 \u2212 w(1 \u2212 P11 )] \u2212 P11\n.\nP10 =\n1\u2212w\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\n8\n\nThen the effective entrance and exit rates can be expressed using Eqs.

However,\nbecause our theory is a mean-field approach, it can be argued that in the real system it\ndoes not exist. At the phase transformation line a linear density profile, characteristic\nfor first-order phase transitions, is expected [1]. The calculated phase diagram is also\nshown in figure 4. Note that for w = 0 two channels are uncoupled and we recover the\nresults for individual single-lattice ASEPs, as expected. In the limit of strong coupling\n(w = 1) the predicted phase diagram is also agrees with the one discussed earlier.\nIt is interesting to note that in the case of symmetric coupling the phase diagram for\ntwo-channel ASEPs is very similar to a phase diagram for the single-chain ASEPs with\nlocal inhomogeneity [24]. The connection between two systems can be easily understood\nfrom figure 1. In each lane the hoping rate to the right is the same at all sites except at\nthe one that couples the channels. Then the motion along each lattice can be viewed as\na transport along a single-lane ASEP with local defect that was studied in Ref. [24].\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes\n\n9\n\n2.3. Asymmetric coupling\nThe dynamics in the system of two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous coupling\nbecome very complex for asymmetric vertical transition rates, i.e., when w1 6= w2 .,\nand the symmetry between two lattices no longer exists. Specifically, the densities at\nthe last sites of the left segments and densities at the first sites of right segments are\nR\nnot equal: \u03c1L1 6= \u03c1L2 , and \u03c1R\n1 6= \u03c12 . To specify a state of the system we use the notation\n(x, y; w, z) with x, y, w and z corresponding to the phase in the segments 1L, 1R, 2L\nand 2R respectively, and each of them is able to take the values LD, HD or MC. It is\nconvenient to view the system with the asymmetric coupling slightly differently from\nthe symmetric case, as shown in figure 3. Segments 2L and 1R have L/2 sites while 1L\nand 2R segments are longer with L/2 + 1 sites. However, because we consider dynamics\nin the thermodynamic limit (L \u226b 1), the difference in the sizes does not matter and all\nsegments still can be viewed as homogeneous single-chain ASEP with known stationary\nproperties.\n\n1\n\nlane 2\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n\u03b1\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n\u03c12L\n\n1\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n1\n\n\u03b2eff,2\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nlane 1\n\n\u03c1R2\n\n1 w\n2\nn\n\n\u03b2\n\nn2 2\nw1 \u03c1R\n1\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n11\n\n\u03c11L\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n000111\n111\n000\n111\n\n1\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n000111\n111\n000\n111\n\n\u03b1eff,1\n\nFigure 3. Effective scheme for two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous asymmetric\ncoupling.\n\nTo simplify calculations, we consider the case of maximal asymmetry with w1 = 1\nand w2 = 0. Our calculations can be easily generalized for general values of vertical\ntransition rates. The particle can enter the segment 1R only when the vertical cluster is\nfully occupied, and it produces the following expression for the effective entrance rate,\n\u03b1ef f,1 = P11 .\n\n(36)\n\nHowever, as can be seen from figure 3, there are two ways to enter the segment 2R:\nfrom the left segment 2L and from the partially-filled vertical configuration with the\nprobability P10 . Then the effective entrance in this case is equal to\nP10\n, \u03c1R\n(37)\n\u03b1ef f,2 = \u03c1L2 +\n2 = P11 + P01 .\n1 \u2212 \u03c1R\n2\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes 10\nUsing similar arguments it can be shown that the effective exit rate from the segment\n2L is given by the expression,\n\u03b2ef f,1 = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03c1R\n1 P11\n,\n\u03c1L1\n\n\u03c1L1 = P11 + P10 ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhile the effective rate out of 2L segment is\n\u03b2ef f,2 = 1 \u2212 \u03c1R\n2.\n\n(39)\n\nThe densities at the last and at the first sites of segments play important role in\nour analysis.

However, not all\nphases exist due to constraints of steady-state conditions. MC phase cannot exist in the\nsegment 1R because from Eq. (49) we have J1R < J1L and 1/4 is the maximal possible\nflux through any segment. Similarly, it is not possible to have MC phase in the segment\n2L since J2L < J2R . These arguments already eliminate 27 + 27 \u2212 9 = 45 phases. It is\nalso not possible to have at stationary state the phases (HD,LD; x,y) for any x and y.\nFor these phase to exist we must have from Eqs.

In analogous way it can be shown that phases (x,y; HD,LD)\nare not found at stationary state. Finally, using similar approach we have determined\nthat there are only 10 phases that can be supported in the system at t \u2192 \u221e.\nThe resulting phase diagram is presented in figure 5. Our theoretical calculations\nshow that (MC,LD;HD,MC) phase can be found for \u03b1 > 1/2 and \u03b2 > 1/2;\n(MC,LD;HD,HD) exists for \u03b1 > 1/2 and 0.24 < \u03b2 < 1/2; (MC,HD;HD,HD) phase\nis realized for \u03b1 > 1/2 and 0.22 < \u03b2 < 0.24; (LD,LD;HD,MC) phase exists for\n0.24 < \u03b1 < 1/2 and \u03b2 > 1/2; and (LD,LD;LD,MC) phase can be found for\n0.19 < \u03b1 < 0.24 and \u03b2 > 1/2.

Monte-Carlo simulations and discussion\nThe presented theoretical description of two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous\ncoupling treats the particle dynamics in horizontal segments and in the vertical junction\ncluster exactly.

The\ntotal number of steps has been varied between 2\u00d7107 and 109 . To ensure that our system\nhad reached the stationary state we ignored first 3 \u2212 5% of all steps in each simulation.\nOur theoretical results are valid in the thermodynamic limit of L \u2192 \u221e, indicating that\nfinite-size effects are neglected. In our simulations we used mostly L = 1000 sites lattices,\nbut occasionally checked some computations for lattices of sizes L = 100 or L = 10000.\nComputed dynamic properties have been found to be unaffected by lattice size variation,\nconfirming absence of finite-size effects. Phase diagram boundaries between different\nphases have been determined by analyzing density profile and particle currents.

Thick lines describe first-order phase transitions, thin\nlines represent continuous phase transformations.\n\ncase where we have transitions between LD and HD phases it is possible to visually\nobserve the phase boundary: it happens when the density profile becomes linear. This\nmethod allowed us to determine the phase boundaries within 0.01 units of the numerical\nvalues assigned to \u03b1 and \u03b2. In the case of transitions between an MC phase and LD/HD\nphases, phase borders have been determined by observing the saturation of the particle\ncurrent for specific \u03b1 and \u03b2 values. This approach, although not as exact as the previous\none, still allows us to compute the phase transition line to within 0.05 units of the \u03b1\nand \u03b2 values.\nPhase diagram for two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous symmetric coupling,\nobtained from Monte Carlo simulations is presented in figure 4, and it can be concluded\nthat the approximate theoretical approach agrees well with computer simulations. The\nagreement is excellent for weak coupling between the channels (w \u226a 1), while increasing\nthe probability of vertical transitions (w \u2243 1) leads to stronger correlations in the\nsystem, and theoretical predictions start to deviate from Monte Carlo simulations. More\ninformation can be obtained from density profiles plotted in figure 6. Our theory gives\nexcellent agreement for bulk densities in (HD,HD) and (LD,LD) phases for any coupling\nbetween the channels: see figures 6a and 6b. This is because the dynamics of the system\nin these cases is governed by entrance or exit processes. However, in (HD,LD) phase\nthe theoretical predictions only qualitatively agree with computer simulations, as can\nbe seen in figure 6c. This observation can be explained by the fact that in this phase\nthe dynamics is governed by processes near the vertical junction cluster, and our theory\nneglects correlations between different segments of the system.\nStationary-state phase behavior in two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous\nasymmetric coupling is much more complex, as shown in figure 5.

Theoretical calculations for phase boundaries mostly agree with\ncomputer simulations, although there are deviations for small \u03b1 and/or small \u03b2. Density\nprofiles of six phases for asymmetric coupling are presented in figure 7. The agreement\nbetween theoretical calculations and computer simulations is excellent in the phases\nwhere dynamic properties depend on the entrance and exit rates: see figures 7c, 7d and\n7e. However, deviations between the theory and Monte Carlo simulations are observed\nin the phases where dynamics is specified by the processes near the vertical junction\ncluster. Although our theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo computer simulations\nhave been performed for the case of strong asymmetry (w1 = 1 and w2 = 0), they can\nbe easily extended for other asymmetric transition rates, and we expect a similar phase\ndiagram and stationary densities and particle currents.\nOur theoretical calculations, supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations,\nindicate that for symmetric coupling between the channels the phase diagram is quite\nsimple with only three phases. However, breaking this symmetry leads to a very complex\ndynamics with 10 stationary-state phases. This behavior can be understood by analyzing\nparticle fluxes through segments.

In addition, it was shown that the maximal-current phase cannot exist\nunder these conditions. These constraints lead to a simple phase diagram as outlined in\nthe figure 4. In contrast, for the asymmetric coupling between the channels the currents\nthrough all segments are not necessary equal to each other, and MC phase can be found\nunder some conditions in some segments. This leads to existence of many steady-state\nphases in the system.\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes 16\nThe phase diagram for the asymmetric inhomogeneous coupling is almost symmetric\nwith respect to \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2 transformation. This is because the transport of particles from\nthe left can be also viewed as a motion of holes in the opposite direction. However,\nas can be clearly seen from figure 5 there is a slight asymmetry in the phase diagram,\nand it also shows up in the dynamic properties. The deviation from the particle-hole\nsymmetry can be explained by analyzing the dynamics at the vertical junction for the\ncase of w1 = 1 and w2 = 0, as illustrated in figure 8. The particle at the partially\nfilled junction cluster can only move in the vertical direction. At the same time, the\nhole in the partially filled cluster can move vertically and horizontally, if the particle\nfrom the 1L segments enters the cluster. Thus, the corresponding dynamic rules for the\nparticles and for the holes in the vertical cluster are not the same, and it produces the\nslight asymmetry in large-time properties of two-channel ASEPs with inhomogeneous\nasymmetric coupling.\n\nlane 2\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nlane 1\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nFigure 8.

Summary and conclusions\nTwo-channel asymmetric simple exclusion processes with inhomogeneous coupling\nbetween the lattices have been investigated. To better describe the large-time behavior\nof the system a mean-field approach, that treats particle dynamics in four lattice\nsegments and in the vertical cluster exactly while neglecting the correlations between\ndifferent parts of the system, is developed. For symmetric transition rates between the\nchannels the phase diagram is rather simple and it consists of three phases. This is a\nconsequence of constraints on the particle fluxes due to the symmetry. The situation\nis very different for asymmetric coupling between the channels. Here our analysis\nindicates that there are ten stationary phases. It is argued that this complex behavior\n\n\fInhomogeneous Coupling in Two-Channel Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes 17\nis realized because of weaker constraints on the particle currents. Our theoretical\ncalculations are supported by extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations. Slight\ndeviations between theoretical results and computer simulations are only found in the\nphases where correlations around the junction site play important role. Our theoretical\ncalculations and computer simulations also point out to asymmetry in the properties\nof two-channel ASEPs with asymmetric coupling with the respect to the particle-hole\nsymmetry. It is argued that this asymmetry appears due to different dynamic rules for\nthe particles and for the holes at the vertical junction cluster.\nThere are several extensions of this work can be proposed. Two-channel ASEPs\nwith homogeneous asymmetric coupling show a phase diagram with only seven phases\nand very different stationary properties [22]. It will be interesting to increase the region\nof inhomogeneous coupling from one site to many to see how dynamics of the system\nchanges. Another interesting question that will help to understand mechanisms of\nasymmetric exclusion processes is how far coupling clusters should be put in order\nto feel each other. In addition, the analysis can be extended to transport of extended\nparticles [7].\n5. Acknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge the support from the Welch Foundation (under grant no.
