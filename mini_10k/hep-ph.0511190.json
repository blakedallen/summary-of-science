Introduction\nIn heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies we expect the formation of hot and dense matter in the central space-time region of the collision. One can measure the density profile of\nthe color charges in this deconfined region using induced energy loss of partons traversing\nthe dense region in different directions. Data from central rapidity show the transversally\npropagating partons and their large energy loss (see AuAu data from PHENIX [ 1] and\nSTAR [ 2]). At large rapidities strong suppression has been seen by BRAHMS [ 3, 4] in\npion and hadron production. This finding offers the possibility to analyze energy loss for\ndifferent momentum directions.\nWe apply a perturbative QCD improved parton model to describe hadron production\nat high pT [ 5, 6]. The Glauber-Gribov model provides the proper framework to describe\nhadron production as a superposition of proton-proton results to obtain baseline hadron\nspectra in heavy-ion collisions. The parton energy loss is calculated by the GLV-method [\n7], and the opacity of the dense matter is extracted in different rapidity regions, i.e. for\ndifferent parton momentum directions. We include shadowing and multiscattering, tested\nin a wide rapidity range in dAu collisions [ 8, 9].\n\nSupported by Hungarian OTKA T043455, T047050, MTA-NSF-OTKA OISE-0435701, U.S. DE-FG0286ER40251, Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi Scholarship and German DAAD exchange program.\n\n\u2217\n\n\f2\n\nG.G.

In the multidimensional convolution integral (1),\nTAA\u2032 (r, b) = tA (r)tA\u2032 (|b \u2212 r|) is the nuclear overlap function for the colliding nuclei.

Here a b-independent\nSa/A (x) was taken from the HIJING parametrization [ 10].\nThe last term in eq. (1) is the fragmentation function (FF), Dc\u03c0 (zc , Q\u03032 ). This term\ngives the probability for parton c to fragment into a pion with momentum fraction zc at\nscale Q\u0303 = \u03ba\u0303 pT . We apply the KKP parametrization [ 11]. The factorization scale (Q) is\nconnected to the momentum of the intermediate jet, Q = \u03ba * pT /zc , which scales together\nwith Q\u0303 in the FF. We applied \u03ba = \u03ba\u0303 = 2/3 at RHIC energies.\nThe density of the color particles can be measured by the induced energy loss of highenergy quarks and gluons traveling through the hot dense deconfined matter. One can\ndetermine the non-abelian radiative energy loss, \u2206E(E, L). This quantity depends on the\ncolor charge density through the opacity, n\u0304 = L/\u03bb, where L is the length of the traversed\nmatter and \u03bb is the mean free path. In \"thin plasma\" approximation the energy loss is\ngiven by the following expression [ 7]:\n\u2206EGLV\n\nCR \u03b1s L2 \u03bc2\nE\n=\nlog\nN(E) \u03bb\n\u03bc\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nHere CR is the color Casimir of the jet and \u03bc2 /\u03bb \u223c \u03b1s2 \u03c1part is a transport coefficient of the\nmedium, which is proportional to the parton density, \u03c1part . The color Debye screening\nscale is denoted by \u03bc. N(E) is an energy dependent numerical factor with an asymptotic\nvalue 4 at high jet energies.\nJet energy loss influences the final hadron spectra. We can introduce this effect via\nmodifying the momentum fraction of the outgoing parton before the fragmentation. Considering an average energy loss, \u2206E, in a static plasma, the argument of the fragmentation\nfunctions will be modified as\nD\u03c0/c (zc , Q\u03032 )\n\u03c0zc2\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nzc\u2217 D\u03c0/c (zc\u2217 , Q\u03032 )\n.\nzc\n\u03c0zc2\n\nHere zc\u2217 = zc / (1 \u2212 \u2206E/pc ) is the modified momentum fraction.\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe Nuclear Modification Factor at Large Rapidities\n\n3\n\n\u03c0\n3.

The dAu results indicate the validity of our LO perturbative QCD calculations including multiscattering and shadowing [ 8, 9]. Data on pion\nand charge hadron production are shown from PHENIX [ 12] and BRAHMS [ 13].\n\n\u03c0\nFigure 1. Nuclear modification factors at different rapidities: RdAu\nin dAu collisions\n\u03c0\n(upper row), RAuAu in 0 \u2212 10% central AuAu\ncollisions\n(lower\nrow).\nData are from\n\u221a\nPHENIX [ 1, 12] and BRAHMS [ 3, 13] at s = 200 AGeV. Full lines display our pQCD\nresults, the bands indicate the theoretical uncertainties on the value of the opacity.\n\nIn AuAu collisions strong final state interaction (induced jet energy loss) appears and\ndata display suppression at high pT [ 1]. At midrapidity, our pQCD result with average\nopacity of L/\u03bb = 4.0 \u00b1 0.25 is consistent with data at pT \u2265 4 GeV/c, where the high-pT\nregion sets in (see Fig. 1). Recent BRAHMS data [ 3, 4] may indicate rapidity independent suppression for pion production in the intermediate-pT region (pT < 3.5 GeV/c).\nAssuming that this finding is also valid for the high-pT region, we wish to achieve a similar\nhigh-pT suppression at large rapidities. A smaller opacity, L/\u03bb = 3.5 \u00b1 0.25 at \u03b7 = 1, and\nL/\u03bb = 1.5 \u00b1 0.25 at \u03b7 = 3.2 is needed to do this. (Note the difference between charge\nhadron and pion suppression.) This result indicates that longitudinally traveling partons\nsee less colored matter then those traveling in the transverse direction.\n\u221a\nFig. 2 displays available data and our pQCD results for AuAu collisions at s =\n62.4 AGeV for different \u03b7 values. Due to the smaller Bjorken energy density [ 3, 14],\n62.4\n\u03b5Bj\n< \u03b5200\nBj , we have used reduced opacity parameters, namely L/\u03bb = 3.25 \u00b1 0.25 at\nmid-rapidity, L/\u03bb = 2.75 \u00b1 0.25 at \u03b7 = 1. and L/\u03bb = 0.75 \u00b1 0.25 at \u03b7 = 3.2. Extended\nbands indicate the size of the theoretical uncertainties on the induced energy loss.\n\n\f4\n\nG.G. Barnaf\u00f6ldi, P. L\u00e9vai, G. Papp, and G. Fai\n\n\u03c0\nFigure 2.

Our pQCD results with varying opacities\n(full lines and bands) are compared to PHENIX [ 1], STAR [ 2], and BRAHMS [ 3] data.\n\u03c0\nComparing RAuAu\nresults of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the decreasing tendency of the opacity\nparameter is clearly seen as \u03b7 is increasing. At large forward rapidities the interplay between stronger shadowing and weaker quenching effects maintains\n\u221a a rapidity independent\nnuclear modification factor (no data are available at \u03b7 = 3.2 for s = 62.4 AGeV AuAu).\nWhether \u03c0 suppression is approximately rapidity independent will of course be decided\nby the data. The present hint of this behavior motivated us in this study to examine\nthe interplay of rapidity dependence and jet energy loss. One particle quark tomography\ncombined with jet-jet correlation results provides information on the geometry of the hot\nregion. Energy dependence and CuCu results may be used to verify our conclusions.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n\nV.
