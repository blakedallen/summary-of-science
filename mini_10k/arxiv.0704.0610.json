For defocusing nonlinearity the shock survives\nthe smoothing effect of the nonlocal response, though its dynamics is qualitatively affected by the\nlatter, whereas for focusing nonlinearity it dominates over filamentation. The patterns observed in\na thermal defocusing medium are interpreted in the framework of our theory.\n\nShock waves are a general phenomenon thoroughly investigated in disparate area of physics (fluids and water\nwaves, plasma physics, gas dynamics, sound propagation,\nphysics of explosions, etc.), entailing the propagation of\ndiscontinuous solutions typical of hyperbolic PDE models [1, 2]. They are also expected in (non-hyperbolic)\nuniversal models for dispersive nonlinear media, such as\nthe Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) and nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\n(NLS, or analogous Gross-Pitaevskii) equations, since hydrodynamical approximations of such models hold true\nin certain regimes (typically, in the weakly dispersive or\nstrongly nonlinear case) [3, 4, 5]. However, in the latter cases, no true discontinuous solutions are permitted.\nThe general scenario, first investigated by Gurevich and\nPitaevskii [3], is that dispersion regularizes the shock, determining the onset of oscillations that appear near wavebreaking points and expand afterwards. This so-called\ncollisionless shock has been observed for example in ionacoustic waves [6], or wave-breaking of optical pulses in\na normally dispersive fiber [7], and recently in a BoseEinstein condensate with positive scattering length [8].\nIn this Letter we investigate how nonlocality of the\nnonlinear response affects the formation of a collisionless\nshock in a system ruled by a NLS model. In fact nonlocality plays a key role in many physical systems due to transport phenomena and finite range interactions (e.g. as in\nBose-Einstein condensation), and can be naively thought\nto smooth and eventually wipe out steep fronts characteristic of shocks. More specifically, we place this problem\nin the context of nonlinear optics where nonlocality arises\nquite naturally in different media [9, 10, 11, 12], studying the spatial propagation of a fundamental (gaussian\nTEM00 ) laser mode subject to diffraction and nonlocal\nfocusing/defocusing action (Kerr effect). In a defocusing and ideal (local and lossless) medium, high intensity\nportions of the beam diffract more rapidly than the tails\nleading, at sufficiently high powers, to overtaking and oscillatory wave-breaking similar (in 1D) to what observed\nin the temporal case [18]. We find that, while shock is\nnot hampered by the presence of (even strong) nonlocality, the mechanism of its formation as well as post-shock\n\npatterns are qualitatively affected by the nonlocality. Experimental results obtained with a thermal defocusing\nnonlinearity are consistent with our theory and shed new\nlight on the interpretation of the thermal lensing phenomenon.\nImportantly, our theory permits also to establish that\nnonlocality allows the shock to form also in the focusing\nregime where, contrary to the local case, it can prevails\nover filamentation or modulational instability (MI).\nTheory We start from the paraxial wave equation\nobeyed by the envelope A of a monochromatic field\nE = ( c\u01eb20 n )1/2 A exp(ikZ \u2212 i\u03c9T ) (|A|2 is the intensity)\n\u2202A\n1\ni\n+\n\u2202Z\n2k\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022A\n\u22022A\n+\n\u2202X 2\n\u2202Y 2\n\n\u0013\n\n+ k0 \u2206nA = \u2212i\n\n\u03b10\nA.\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k = k0 n = \u03c9c n is the wave-number, and \u03b10\nthe intensity loss rate. A sufficiently general nonlocal\nmodel can be obtained by coupling Eq. (1) to an equation that rules the refractive index change \u2206n of nonlinear origin. Introducing the scaled coordinates x, y, \u221a\nz =\nX/w0 , Y /w0 , Z/L, and complex variables \u03c8 = A/ I0\nand \u03b8 = k0 Lnl \u2206n, where Lnl = (k0 |n2 |I0 )\u22121 is the nonlinear length scale associated with peak intensity I0 and\na local Kerr coefficient n2 (\u2206n = n2 |A|2 ), Ld = kw02 is\nthe characteristic diffraction\u221alength associated with the\ninput spot-size w0 , and L \u2261 Lnl Ld , such model can be\nconveniently written as follows [12]\ni\u03b5\n\n\u2202\u03c8 \u03b52 2\n\u03b1\n+ \u2207\u22a5 \u03c8 + \u03c7\u03b8\u03c8 = \u2212i \u03b5\u03c8,\n\u2202z\n2\n2\n\u2212\u03c3 2 \u22072\u22a5 \u03b8 + \u03b8 = |\u03c8|2 ,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b10 L, \u22072\u22a5 = \u2202x2 + \u2202y2 , \u03c7 = n2 /|n2 | = \u00b11 is\nthe sign of the nonlinearity, and \u03c3 2 is a free parameter\nthat measures the degree of nonlocality. The peculiar\ndimensionless\nform of Eqs. (2-3) where \u03b5 \u2261 Lnl /L =\np\nLnl /Ld is a small quantity, highlights the fact that we\nwill deal with the weakly diffracting (or strongly nonlinear) regime, such that the local \u03c3 = 0 and lossless\n\u03b1 = 0 limit yields a semiclassical Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwith cubic potential (\u03b5 and z replace Planck constant\n\n\f2\nand time, respectively). We study Eqs. (2-3) subject\nto thepaxi-symmetric gaussian input \u03c80 (r) = exp(\u2212r2 ),\nx2 + y 2 , describing a fundamental laser mode\nr \u2261\nat its waist. For \u03b5 \u226a 1, its evolution can be studied\nin the framework of the WKB trasformation \u03c8(r, z) =\np\n\u03c1(r, z) exp [i\u03c6(r, z)/ \u03b5] [4]. Substituting in Eqs. (2-3)\nand retaining only leading orders in \u03b5, we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(D \u2212 1)\n\u03c1z +\n\u03c1u + (\u03c1u)r = \u2212\u03b1\u03c1; uz + uur \u2212 \u03c7\u03b8r = 0,\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\nD\u22121\n2\n(4)\n\u03b8r + \u03b8 = \u03c1.\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03b8rr +\nr\nwhere u \u2261 \u03c6r is the phase chirp, and D = 2 is the transverse dimensionality. The 1D case described by Eqs. (4)\nwith D = 1 and r \u2192 x (\u2202y = 0) illustrates the basic physics with least complexity. In the defocusing case\n(\u03c7 = \u22121) for an ideal medium (\u03c3 = \u03b1 = 0, \u03b8 = \u03c1),\nEqs. (4) are a well known hyperbolic system of conservation laws (Eulero and continuity equations) with real\ncelerities (or eigenspeeds, i.e. velocities of Riemann in\u221a\nvariants) v \u00b1 = u \u00b1 \u2212\u03c7\u03c1, which rules gas dynamics (u\nand \u03c1 are velocity and mass density of a gas with pressure \u221d \u03c12 ). A gaussian input is known to develop two\nsymmetric shocks at finite z [4]. Importantly the diffraction, which is initially of order \u03b52 , starts to play a major\nrole in the proximity of the overtaking point, and regularize the wave-breaking through the appearance of fast\n(wavelength \u223c \u03b5) oscillations which connect the high and\nlow sides of the front and expand outwards (far from the\nbeam center) [3]. Such oscillations, characteristic of a collisionless shock, appear simultaneously in intensity and\nphase chirp (u) as clearly shown in Fig. 1(a,c).\nIn the nonlocal case, the index change \u03b8(x) can be\nwider than the gaussian mode (for large \u03c3) and the shock\ndynamics is essentially driven by the chirp u with \u03c1 adiabatically following. This can be seen by means of the following approximate solution of Eqs. (4): considering that\nthe equation for \u03c1 is of lesser order [O(\u01eb)], with respect\nto those for \u03b8 and u [O(1)], we assume \u03c1 = exp(\u22122x2 )\nunchanged in z and solve exactly the third of Eq. (4) for\n\u03b8(x) (though derived easily, its full expression is quite\ncumbersome). Then, applying the theory of characteristics [1], the second of Eqs. (4) is reduced to the following\nODEs, where dot stands for d/dz\n\u1e8b = u ; u\u0307 = \u03c7\u03b8x ,\n\n(5)\n\nequivalent to the motion of a unit mass in the potential\n2\nV (x) = \u2212\u03c7\u03b8 with conserved energy E = u(z)\n+ V (x).\n2\nThe solution of Eqs. (5) with initial condition x(0) =\ns, u(0) = 0 yields x(s, z), u(s, z) in parametric form, from\nwhich overtaking is found whenever u(x, z) (obtained\nby eliminating s) becomes a multivalued function of x\nat finite z = zs . The shock point corresponding to\n|du/dx| \u2192 \u221e is found from the solution u(x, z) displayed\nin Fig. 2(a) [ 2(b)], at positions x = \u00b1xs 6= 0 (defocusing\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) 1D spatial\np profiles of phase chirp u(x)\n(a-b) and amplitude |\u03c8(x)| = \u03c1(x) (c-d), as obtained from\nEqs.

The shock distance zs\nincreases with \u03c3 in both cases, as shown in Fig. 2(c).\nWe have tested these predictions by integrating numerically Eqs. (2-3). Simulations with \u03c7 = \u22121 [see Fig.\n1(b,d)] show indeed steepening and post-shock oscillations in the spatial chirp u, which are accompanied by\na steep front in \u03c1 moving outward. The shock location\nin x and z is in good agreement with the results of our\napproximate analysis summarized in Fig. 2.\nNumerical simulations of Eqs. (2-3) validates also\nthe focusing scenario. The field evolution displayed in\nFig. 3(a) exhibits shock formation at the focus point\n(xs = 0, zs \u2243 8, for \u03c3 = 5) driven the phase whose chirp\nis shown in Fig. 3(b). This is remarkable because, in\nthe local limit \u03c3 = 0, the celerities become imaginary\n(the equivalent gas would have pressure decreasing with\nincreasing density \u03c1), and no shock could be claimed to\nexist. In this limit, the reduced problem (4) is elliptic and\nthe initial value problem is ill-posed [13], an ultimate consequence of the onset of MI: modes with transverse (nor-\n\n\f3\n\u2206T\u22a5 (X, Y ) obeys the following 2D heat equation\n2\n(\u2202X\n+ \u2202Y2 )\u2206T\u22a5 \u2212 C\u2206T\u22a5 = \u2212\u03b3|A|2\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Level plot of the intensity in the\nfocusing case (\u03c7 = 1, \u03b5 = 0.01): (a) nonlocal case (\u03c3 2 =\n25); (b) chirp profile for various z for (a); (c) quasi-local case\n(\u03c3 2 = 10\u22125 ).\n\nmalized) wavenumber q < \u2206q grow exponentially with z,\nwith both gain g and bandwidth \u2206q scaling as 1/\u03b5. However, the nonlocal response tends to frustrate MI (see also\nRefs. [9, 12]), as shown\npby standard linear stability analysis which yields g = d(2\u03c7 \u2212 d)/\u03b52 (we set d \u2261 \u03b52 q 2 /2\nand \u03c7 \u2261 \u03c7/(1 + \u03c3 2 q 2 )), in turn implying a strong reduction of both gain and bandwidth for large \u03c3. In order\nto emphasize the difference between the local and nonlocal regime, we contrast Fig. 3(a) with the analogous\nevolution [see Fig. 3(c)] obtained in the quasi-local limit\n(\u03c3 2 = 10\u22125 ), which appears to be clearly dominated by\nfilamentation.\nThermal nonlinearity The physics of the defocusing\ncase can be experimentally tested by exploiting thermal nonlinearities of strongly absorptive bulk samples,\nthat we show below to fit our model. In this case, the\nsystem relaxes to a steady-state refractive index change\n\u2206n = (dn/dT )\u2206T , where dn/dT is the thermal coefficient, and \u2206T the local temperature change due to\noptical absorption. It is well known that this so-called\nthermal lens distorts a laser beam propagating in the\nmedium [14, 15, 16]. However, only perturbative approaches to the problem have been proposed (ray optics\nor Fresnel diffraction theory is applied after the lens profile is worked out from gaussian ansatz [14]), while the\nrole of shock phenomena was completely overlooked.\n\nFIG. 4: 2D evolution according to Eqs. (2-3) with \u03c3 2 = 1,\n\u03b1 = 1: (a) radial phase chirp at different z, as indicated,\nshowing steepening and shock formation for \u03b5 = 10\u22122 ; (b) corresponding intensity profile |\u03c8|2 (maximum scaled to unity)\nat z = 4.9; (c) transverse intensity profile vs. x (at y = 0) at\nz = 1/(4\u03b5) and different values of \u03b5 (\u03b10 = 62cm\u22121 , \u03c3 = 0.3).\n\nWe assume that the temperature field \u2206T\n\n=\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the source term account for absorption proportional to intensity through the coefficient \u03b3 =\n\u03b10 /(\u03c10 cp DT ), where \u03c10 the material density, cp the specific heat at constant pressure, and DT is the thermal\ndiffusivity (see e.g. [16]). Eq. (6) has been already employed to model a refractive index of thermal origin in\nRef. [10], and in Ref. [11] in the limit C = 0 which\nis equivalent to consider the range of nonlocality (measured by 1/C, see below) to be infinite. Starting from\nthe 3D heat equation \u22072 \u2206T = \u2212\u03b3|A|2 , the latter regime\namounts to assume \u2206T (X, Y, Z) = \u2206T\u22a5 (X, Y ), which is\njustified when longitudinal changes in intensity |A|2 are\nnegligible as for solitary (invariant in Z) wave-packets\nin the presence of low absorption [11]. Viceversa, in the\nregime of strong absorption, we need to account for longitudinal temperature profiles that are known from solutions of the 3D heat equations to be peaked at characteristic distance \u1e90 in the middle of sample and decay to\nroom temperature on the facets [14]. Since highly nonlinear phenomena occurs in the neighborhood of \u1e90 where\nthe index change is maximum, we can use a (longitudinal) parabolic approximation with characteristic width\ni the 3D temperature field \u2206T (X, Y, Z) =\nhLef f (\u223c L) of\n1\u2212\n\n(Z\u2212\u1e90)2\n2L2ef f\n\n\u2206T\u22a5 (X, Y ) and consequently approximate\n\n2\n\u22072 \u2206T \u2243 (\u2202X\n+ \u2202Y2 )\u2206T\u22a5 \u2212 L\u22122\nef f \u2206T\u22a5 , so that the 3D\nheat equation reduces to Eq. (6) with C = 1/L2ef f .\nFollowing this approach, Eq. (6) coupled to Eq. (1)\ncan be casted in the form of Eqs. (2-3) by posing\n\u03b8 = k0 Lnl |dn/dT |\u2206T\u22a5 and \u03c3 2 = 1/(Cw02 ) = L2ef f /w02 .\nThe model reproduces the infinite range nonlocality for\nnegligible losses (Lef f \u2192 \u221e); while for thin samples\n2\n[|(\u2202X\n+ \u2202Y2 )\u2206T\u22a5 | << |L\u22122\nef f \u2206T\u22a5 |], Lef f can be related\nto the Kerr coefficient n2 as\ns\ns\n|n2 |\nDT \u03c10 cp |n2 |\n=\n(7)\nLef f =\n\u03b3|dn/dT |\n\u03b10 |dn/dT |\n\nwhich establishes a link between the degree of nonlocality and the strength of the nonlinear response (similarly\nto other nonlocal materials [12]).\nHaving retrieved the model Eqs. (2-3), let us show\nnext that the scenario illustrated previously applies substantially unchanged in bulk (2D case) even on account\nfor the optical power loss (\u03b1 6= 0). An example of the\ngeneral dynamics is shown in Fig. 4, where we report a\nsimulation of the full model (2-3), with \u03c3 2 = 1 and relatively large loss \u03b1 = 1. In analogy to the 1D case, Fig.\n4(a) clearly shows that the radial chirp u = \u03c6r steepens and then develop characteristic oscillations after the\nshock point (z \u2243 6, where |\u2202r u| \u2192 \u221e). Correspondingly the intensity exhibits also an external front which\nis connected to a flat central region with a characteristic overshoot [see Fig. 4(b)] corresponding to a brighter\n\n\f4\nring [inset in Fig. 4(c)]. For larger distances this structure moves outward following the motion of the shock.\nIn the experiment such motion can be observed, at fixed\nphysical lenght, by increasing the power, which amounts\nto decrease \u03b5 while scaling z and \u03b1 accordingly (z \u221d 1/\u03b5,\n\u03b1 \u221d \u03b5), as displayed in Fig. 4(c) for \u03c3 = 0.3.\nAs a sample of a strongly absorbing medium we choose\na 1 mm long cell filled with an acqueous solution of\nRhodamine B (0.6 mM concentration). Our measurements of the linear and nonlinear properties of the sample performed by means of the Z-scan technique gives\ndata consistent with the literature [17], and allows us\nto extrapolate at the operating vacuum wavelength of\n532 nm, a linear index n = 1.3, a defocusing nonlinear index n2 = 7 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2 W\u22121 , and \u03b10 = 62 cm\u22121 .\nFor our sample DT = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 m2 s\u22121 , \u03c10 = 103 kg\nm\u22123 , cp = 4 \u00d7 103 Jkg \u22121 K \u22121 and |dn/dT | = 10\u22124 K\u22121\n(\u03b3 \u223c\n= 104 K W\u22121 ), and exploiting Eq. (7) we estimate\nLef f \u223c\n= 10\u03bcm (Lef f << L because of the strong absorption that causes strong heating of our sample near\nthe input facet), and correspondingly the degree of nonlocality \u03c3 \u223c\n= 0.3. We operate with an input\n\u221a gaussian\nbeam with fixed intensity waist w0I = w0 / 2 = 20 \u03bcm\n(Ld \u223c\n= 12 mm) focused onto the input face of the cell.\n2\nWith these numbers, an input power P = \u03c0w0I\nI0 = 200\nmW yields a nonlinear length Lnl \u223c\n= 8 \u03bcm (L \u223c\n= 0.3 mm),\nwhich allows us to work in the semiclassical regime with\n\u03b5\u223c\n= 0.025. The radial intensity profiles together with the\n2D patterns imaged by means of a 40\u00d7 microscope objective and a recording CCD camera are reported in Fig. 5.\nAs shown the beam exhibits the formation of the bright\nring whose external front moves outward with increasing\npower, consistently with the reported simulations. We\npoint out that, at higher powers, we observe (both experimentally and numerically) that the moving intensity\nfront leaves behind damped oscillations that correspond\nto inner rings of lesser brightness, as reported in literature [15]. This, however, occurs well beyond the shock\npoint that we have characterized so far.\nIn summary, the evolution of a gaussian beam in the\nstrong nonlinear regime is characterized by occurence of\ncollisionless (i.e., regularized by diffraction) shocks that\nsurvive the smoothing effect of (even strong) nonlocality.\nWhile experimental results support the theoretical scenario in the defocusing case, the remarkable result that\nthe nonlocality favours shock dynamics over filamentation requires future investigation.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: claudio.conti@phys.uniroma1.it\n[1] G.
