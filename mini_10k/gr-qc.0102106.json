We then generalize both constructions to allow for caustics and\nsingularities that necessarily arise in these formalisms.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring the first half of the XXth century, while trying to understand the group\nof transformations of differential equations, Cartan laid down the foundations of\nmodern differential geometry and established a link between analysis and geometry. One particular example that will be discussed in this work shows Cartan's\napproach to the classification of solutions of ODEs [1, 2, 3]. Consider the 2-dim\nspace E 2 with local coordinates (x, y) and the following third order ODE\ny \u2032\u2032\u2032 = F (x, y, y \u2032, y \u2032\u2032),\n\n(1)\n\nwith \"prime\" denoting the derivative with respect to the independent variable.\nIf one performs a coordinate transformation on E 2 one gets another ODE that\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: {forni, mirta, kozameh, fparisi}@fis.uncor.edu\n\n1\n\n\fis trivially related to the above equation. Cartan thus considered the issue of\nhow to classify solutions of third order ODEs into equivalence classes, with two\nsolutions belonging to the same class if the corresponding ODEs were related by\na coordinate transformation on E 2 . It is clear that one can spend many hours\nbefore finding the appropriate coordinate transformation that will turn one ODE\ninto the other. Cartan showed that with the general solution of a given third\norder ODE, like the above, one can explicitly construct a connection one form on\na 4-dim space E 4 with local coordinates (x, y, y \u2032, y \u2032\u2032) (the details are presented in\nthe next section). Furthermore, Cartan showed that two third order ODEs are\nequivalent if their corresponding solutions yield the same geometric structure on\nE 4 . Cartan also showed that when F satisfies a given PDE on E 4 , symbolically\nwritten as M[F ] = 0, then the connection is torsion free and a unique conformal\nstructure can be given on the solution space (3-dim parameter space) of the\nstarting ODE.\nIt is worth mentioning that the same equation M[F ] = 0 arises in the three\ndimensional version of the so called Null Surface Formulation (NSF) of General\nRelativity (GR) [4]. As we will see below, this is not mere coincidence since we\nwill show that the 3-dim version of NSF is almost contained in one of Cartan's\nworks [1]. Finding the correspondence between these two constructions was one\nof the motivations for writing this work.\nIn the NSF the main variable is a function u = Z(\u03c6), with \u03c6 \u2208 S 1 , subject to\na third-order ordinary differential equation of the form\nu\u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u039b (\u03c6, u, u\u2032, u\u2032\u2032),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the function \u039b is restricted to satisfy the \"metricity condition\" M[\u039b ] =\n0. The general solution of (2) is given by u = Z(xa , \u03c6), with the constants of\nintegration xa taken as coordinates of the 3D solution manifold E 3 . From this\nsolution a space-time metric for E 3 can be constructed such that the level surfaces\nof Z are null foliations of E 3 for each fixed value of \u03c6. Furthermore, the covector\nla \u2261 \u2202a Z spans, for fixed values of xa , the circle of null directions and thus the\nparameter \u03c6 \u2208 S 1 . Except for the relabelling of functions and the topology of\nthe starting space E 2 , both formulations share many geometric features, with\nCartan emphasizing the role of the connection one-form and the NSF the explicit\nconstruction of a metric on the solution space of (2).\nBut a key point arises by noting that, by assumption, both formulations are\nlocal constructions in the 2-dim manifold. It follows from this fact that the\nsolutions to (1) are families of smooth curves and (as we will see below) that\n2\n\n\fthe level sets Z(xa , \u03c6) = const are smooth null surfaces of the induced metric in\nthe 3-dim solution space. However, we know that characteristic surfaces develop\ncaustics and singularities as a result of the 'focusing' properties of null geodesic\ncongruences established in GR singularity theorems [5]. Moreover, the solutions\nto (1) that yield these null surfaces with caustics cannot be smooth curves on E 2 ,\nso they must develop self-intersections and singular points.\nA second motivation for this work is thus to consider the non-diffeomorphic\ngeneralization of these geometric constructions in order to account for the folds\nand non-differentiable edges of curves on E 2 that yield null congruences with\ncaustics. The first step is to introduce the curves on E 2 according to Arnold's\ntheory of lagrangian manifolds as [6]:\nu = G(p) \u2212 p G\u2032 (p),\n\u03c6 = \u2212G\u2032 (p);\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n(G(p) is called the generating function). Although G may be smooth, the curve\n(u(p), \u03c6(p)) might have self-intersections and singular points if \u03c6(p) is not injective. The question is how to find the proper G such that (3-4) define a null surface\nby setting u and \u03c6 constant. As we will show in this work, curves with singular\npoints in E 2 will induce null surfaces with caustics in E 3 . Conversely, we will\nalso show that if the null surfaces have conjugate points then the corresponding\nfamilies of curves on E 2 have singularities.\nIn this reformulation, eq. (2) for Z is changed to an equation for G, of the\nsame type,\nd3 G\ne\n= \u039b(p,\nG, G\u2032 , G\u2032\u2032 )\n(5)\ndp3\n\nand the metricity condition M[\u039b ] = 0, which becomes singular at a caustic\ne = 0 whose solutions are the\npoint, yields an entirely well-behaved equation M\u0303 [\u039b]\n\"appropriate\" r.h.s. of ( 5). As we will see in an example, among the solutions\nof (5) we obtain generating functions of caustics as listed in [6]. This result\nencounters an immediate application inside the 2+1 NSF and also in the full\ntheory because, to be in complete agreement with the standard GR formulation,\nit always remained as an open problem to write the metricity conditions of NSF\nin a form that explicitly shows the existence of the singular solutions [7].\nThe work is organized as follows: in section II we first give an account of Cartan's geometric construction obtained in [1] starting from the third-order equation\n(2). This review is presented in modern language since the original reference was\nwritten before modern differential geometry was invented and it is very difficult\n3\n\n\fto follow. ( It is worth mentioning that one \"variation\" on Cartan's work has\nappeared in the literature [8] but it is different from the original construction.)\nWe then give a brief review of the NSF in 3-dim and show that this formalism is\na particular case of Cartan's construction. In section III we proceed to generalize the local analysis of the previous section and write the regularized metricity\ne = 0. We also find a relation between curves with caustics on E 2\ncondition M\u0303 [\u039b]\nand null surfaces with conjugate points on E 3 . A simple example shows how to\ngenerate germs of caustics for the solutions to (5). We conclude this work with\nsome comments on the possibility of attaching a similar geometric structure to\nthe original construction of the NSF in four dimensions.\n\n2\n\nGeometric approaches to a third-order ODE.\n\nIn this section we present two geometric constructions that arise from a third\norder ordinary differential equation\nu\u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u039b (\u03c6, u, u\u2032, u\u2032\u2032),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere (\u03c6, u) are coordinates on the cylinder S 1 \u00d7 R. As we will see below, it\nturns that one of these constructions is almost contained as a particular case of\nthe other.\n\n2.1\n\nCartan's construction.\n\nWe first present Cartan's approach [1, 3], achieved by interpreting the integral\ncurves u(\u03c6, xa ) as points xa (a = 1, 2, 3) of the three dimensional solution space\nE 3 , attaching to it a Lorenztian metric gab and giving the structure of a one\ndimensional fiber bundle over E 3 , with \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) as the coordinate of the fiber.\nOn the base space we attach a \"null frame\" satisfying\ne1 * e1 = e3 * e3 = e2 * e3 = 0 and e2 * e2 + e1 * e3 = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere ei * ej = gab ei a ej b = gij . In terms of the dual basis \u03c3a i of the null frame,\nthe metric can be written as\ngab = gij \u03c3a i \u03c3b i = \u03c3a 2 \u2297 \u03c3b 2 \u2212 2\u03c3a (1 \u2297 \u03c3b 3) ,\nwhere we have chosen g13 = \u22121. We call the bundle constructed in this way as\nthe bundle of null directions and we denote it by N (E 3 , g). Note that for fixed\n4\n\n\fvalues of \u03c6, the three functions\n(\u03b80 , \u03b81 , \u03b82 ) \u2261 (u, \u03c9, r) \u2261 (u, u\u2032, u\u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(8)\n\ncan be taken as coordinates on the base space of the bundle. Thus, each point of\nthe bundle is locally described by (\u03c6, u, \u03c9, r).\nEquation (6) yields the pfaffian system [9] on N (E 3 , g) which, written in terms\nof these coordinates reads\n\u03c3 1 = du \u2212 \u03c9 d\u03c6,\n\u03c3 2 = d\u03c9 \u2212 r d\u03c6,\n\u03c3 3 = \u03bb (dr \u2212 \u039b d\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b1 \u03c3 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c3 2 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03bb are functions to be determined. If we choose the \u03c3a i to be the\nprojections of (9) to the base space, then the solution of (6) will give null surfaces\nS \u2208 E 3 by setting u(\u03c6, xa ) = const., \u03c6 = const.\nTo characterize the geometric structure defined from (6), Cartan introduces\na connection and a covariant exterior derivative as\nDei = \u03c9i\n\nj\n\nej ,\n\nwhere D is the covariant exterior derivative with respect to this connection\n(see[10, 11, 12]) and \u03c9i j are the connection one-forms. Furthermore, Cartan\ndemands that the connection will be compatible with the metric in the sense that\na null frame remains null under parallel transport, i.e.\nDgij = 2\u03c9\u0304 gij ,\nwhere \u03c9\u0304 is a one-form on the bundle. Therefore,\nwhere \u03c9ij = \u03c9i k gkj .\n\n\u03c9ij + \u03c9ji = \u22122gij \u03c9\u0304\nIt follows from the above that\n\n\u03c911 = \u03c933 = 0, \u03c913 + \u03c931 = \u22122\u03c9\u0304,\n\u03c912 = \u2212\u03c921 , \u03c923 = \u2212\u03c932 , \u03c922 = \u03c9\u0304.\nThus, the connection is determined by four arbitrary one-forms, namely\n\u03c912 , \u03c923 , \u03c931 and \u03c9\u0304.\nNote that \u03c3 i , \u03c923 are linearly independent forms in N (E 3 , g). This assertion\ncan be understood from the geometrical meaning that these forms have:\n5\n\n\f\u2022 \u03c3 1 = \u03c923 = 0 is the differential system for null 2-surfaces, since on this\nsurface D e3 = \u03c913 e3 and D e2 = \u2212\u03c922 e2 + \u03c912 e3 .\n\u2022 \u03c3 1 = \u03c3 2 = \u03c923 = 0 is the differential system for null geodesic, since on this\ncurve D e3 = \u03c913 e3 .\n\u2022 \u03c3 1 = \u03c3 2 = \u03c3 3 = 0 is the differential system for a point of E 3 .\nNote also that the vanishing of \u03c3 1 and \u03c923 is equivalent to impose u = const.,\n\u03c6 = const. Thus, \u03c923 can be chosen to be of the form \u03c923 = \u03bc(d\u03c6 + \u03b3\u03c3 1 )\nwith \u03b3 and \u03bc being a priori arbitrary.\nThe idea is to write the non trivial connection one-forms in terms of the basis\n\u03c3 , \u03c923 and then to impose certain conditions on the torsion and curvature of the\nconnection to uniquely determine the functions \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03bb and \u03bc.\nUsing Cartan's structure equations\ni\n\n\u0398i = d\u03c3 i + \u03c9 i j \u2227 \u03c3 j ,\n\u03a9i j = d\u03c9 i j + \u03c9 i k \u2227 \u03c9 k j ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\u03981 = \u03982 = 0, \u03983 = A \u03c3 1 \u2227 \u03c923\n\n(12)\n\nand imposing\non the torsion two-forms, we find that\n\u03bb = \u03bc = 1,\n1\n\u03b1 =\n\u2202r \u039b,\n3\n1 d\u03b1\n1\n\u03b2 = \u03b12 \u2212\n+ \u2202\u03c9 \u039b,\n2 d\u03c6\n2\nwhere\ndF\n(u, \u03c9, r, \u03c6) = \u2202\u03c6 F + \u03c9 \u2202u F + r \u2202\u03c9 F + \u039b \u2202r F\nd\u03c6\n\n(13)\n\nfor any function F (u, \u03c9, r, \u03c6). Equation (12) has the following geometrical meaning: given a point in E 3 and two vectors, we construct a geodesic parallelogram\nfrom that point (see [13]); then in order to come back to the same point, we only\nneed a translation in the null direction e3 . If the parallelogram is on the null\nsurface (when \u03c3 1 = 0 and \u03c923 = 0), no translation is needed.\n6\n\n\fFurthermore, if we require\n\u03a923 = B \u03c3 1 \u2227 \u03c3 2 + C \u03c3 1 \u2227 \u03c3 3 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwe find that\n\n1\n\u03b3 = \u2202r \u03b1.\n2\nThe geometrical meaning of (14) is that the above curvature two-form should\nvanish when e3 is parallely transported around a parallelogram with one of its\nsides being the null geodesic generated by e3 [1].\nSummarizing, conditions (12) and (14) suffice to uniquely determine the non\ntrivial components of the connection one-form. They are given by\n\u03c923 = d\u03c6 + \u03b3 \u03c3 1 ,\n\n!\n\nd\u03b3\n\u03c9\u0304 = \u2212\u03b1 d\u03c6 + 2\n\u2212 \u2202\u03c9 \u03b1 \u03c3 1 \u2212 2 \u03b3 \u03c3 2 ,\nd\u03c6\n!\nd\u03b3\n+ \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03c31 + \u03b3 \u03c32 ,\n\u03c931 = \u03b1 d\u03c6 +\nd\u03c6\n\u03c912\n\n(15)\n\n!\n\nd\u03b3\n= \u2212\u03b2 d\u03c6 + (\u2202u \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9 \u03b2 + 3\u03b2 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2202r \u03b2) \u03c3 + 2\n\u2212 \u2202\u03c9 \u03b1 \u03c3 2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03c3 3 .\nd\u03c6\n1\n\nUsing the above equations one determines the remaining coefficients for the torsion and curvature in terms of \u039b. In particular, the only non trivial coefficient of\nthe torsion is given by\nA=\n\n1 d2 \u2202r \u039b\n1\nd\u2202r \u039b\n1 d\u2202\u03c9 \u039b\n2\n1\n\u2212 \u2202r \u039b\n\u2212\n+ (\u2202r \u039b )3 + \u2202\u03c9 \u039b \u2202r \u039b + \u2202u \u039b .\n2\n6 d\u03c6\n3\nd\u03c6\n2 d\u03c6\n27\n3\n\nA connection compatible with a Lorenztian metric constructed in this way\nwas called by Cartan a normal metric connection. The main result of Cartan can\nbe stated as follows:\nTheorem 2.1 To each third order ordinary differential equation (up to diffeomorphism in (\u03c6, u)) one can associate a null bundle with a unique normal metric\nconnection and viceversa, i.e. to each bundle of null directions with normal metric connection one can associate a third order ordinary differential equation up\nto diffeomorphism.\n7\n\n\fOne special class of Cartan's connection is particularly interesting to us. If\nwe impose A = 0, the connection is torsion free and the Monge's equation\ngab Y a Y b = 0\nis constant along the fiber, since\ndgab\n2\n= \u2212 \u2202r \u039b gab + 2 A \u03c3a 1 \u2297 \u03c3b 1 .\nd\u03c6\n3\n\n(16)\n\nThus, the condition A = 0 defines a unique conformal structure on the solution\nspace of (6). Moreover, A = 0 is also the condition that the third order ODE\nmust satisfy so that the contact of two neighboring integral curves can be given\nby a Monge's equation of the second order between the parameters of those curves\n[14].\nNote that even in the case that the connection is torsion free, the metric so\nobtained depends on \u03c6, i.e. we have a monoparametric family of conformally\nrelated metrics.\n\n2.2\n\nNSF's construction.\n\nWe now turn our attention to the NSF formulation, in which we have a function\nu = Z(\u03c6) satisfying a third-order ODE\nu\u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u039b (\u03c6, u, u\u2032, u\u2032\u2032),\n\n(17)\n\nwith \u03c6 \u2208 S 1 and \u039b a smooth generic function. The solutions to this equation\nare of the form u = Z(xa ; \u03c6), with xa (a = 1, 2, 3) representing three constants of\nintegration which define the 3-dim manifold of solutions E 3 (equivalent to R3 ).\nNote that the function Z(xa ; \u03c6) plays a double role, namely:\n\u2022 For each fixed xa in E 3 , u = Z(xa ; \u03c6) yields a curve Cx on E 2 with coordinates (u, \u03c6); these curves will be called cuts.\n\u2022 Fixing (u, \u03c6) in E 2 , the relation u = Z(xa ; \u03c6) defines now a surface S(u,\u03c6)\nliving in E 3 .\nIt is important to realize that the analysis is merely done at a local level, so\nthat the curve Cx is certainly the graph of a function in E 2 and S(u,\u03c6) turns out\nto be a smooth surface in E 3 .\n8\n\n\fThe key assumption of NSF comes when we require that, for any value of u\nand \u03c6, S(u,\u03c6) be indeed a null surface of some space-time metric gab (xa ) to be\nattached to E 3 . This condition implies that for fixed values of xa and arbitrary\nvalues of \u03c6 the gradient of Z satisfies\ng ab (xa )\u2207a Z(xa ; \u03c6)\u2207bZ(xa ; \u03c6) = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nNote that as the families of foliations intersect at a single but arbitrary point xa ,\nthe enveloping surface forms the light cone of the point xa . Thus, the parameter\n\u03c6 spans the circle of null directions.\nThe idea now is to consider (18) as an algebraic equation from which the five\ncomponents of the conformal metric can be determined in terms of \u2207a Z(xa , \u03c6).\nGiven an arbitrary function Z, the problem has no solution since we have an\ninfinite number of algebraic equations (one for each value of \u03c6) for five unknowns.\nTherefore, we must impose conditions on Z(xa , \u03c6) so that a solution exists. The\nd\nsolution and conditions are obtained by repeatedly operating d\u03c6\non (18). They\nare best expressed when written in the canonical coordinate system (u, \u03c9, r) given\nin eq.(8). The final expression for the metric components reads\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n0\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u22121\n\u2212 13 \u2202r \u039b\ng ij = \u03a92 \uf8ed 0\n\uf8f8,\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1 \u2212 3 \u2202r \u039b \u2212 3 \u2202(\u2202r \u039b ) + 9 (\u2202r \u039b ) + \u2202\u03c9 \u039b\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the conformal factor must satisfy the differential equation (see [4] for details)\nd\n1\n\u03a9 = \u2202r \u039b \u03a9,\nd\u03c6\n3\nso that the metric is independent of \u03c6. Note that the above equation is invariant\nunder \u03a9(x, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 (x, \u03c6) = f (x)\u03a9(x, \u03c6) for an arbitrary f (x). This freedom is a\nconsequence of the conformal invariance of the formulation.\nThe metricity condition is given by\n!\n\nd(\u2202\u03c9 \u039b )\nd2 (\u2202r \u039b )\n2\nd(\u2202r \u039b )\n2\n+3\n\u2212 \u2202\u03c9 \u039b \u2212 (\u2202r \u039b ) \u2202r \u039b \u2212\n\u2212 6\u2202u \u039b = 0,\nM[\u039b] \u2261 2\n2\nd\u03c6\n9\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\nand constraints the available \u039b s that must enter in the differential equation (17),\nfor only if M[\u039b ] = 0 holds, one is able to construct from the solutions Z(xa ; \u03c6)\nto the ODE a metric according to (19) such that the level surfaces S(u,\u03c6) of Z are\nits characteristic surfaces. Note that this condition is the one deduced by Cartan\n9\n\n\fimposing the connection in the three dimensional manifold E 3 to be torsion free\n(A = 0).\nSummarizing, one solves M[\u039b] = 0, which is a partial differential equation in\nthe variables (u, \u03c9, r, \u03c6) and, denoting by \u039b 0(u, \u03c9, r, \u03c6) its solution and using the\ncoordinates definitions (8), equation (17) becomes\nZ \u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u039b 0 (\u03c6, Z, Z \u2032, Z \u2032\u2032),\n\n(20)\n\nwhich is the ODE whose solutions Z(xa ; \u03c6) allow for the construction of a metric\ngab on E 3 such that the level surfaces of Z are its null hypersurfaces.\nRemark 2.1 It is clear from the above that the NSF construction is the special\ncase of the Cartan's geometric structure with vanishing torsion.\n\n3\n\nSingularities in terms of smooth manifolds\n\nBy assumption, both Cartan's and the NSF are local constructions in the 2-dim\nmanifold. It follows from this that the cuts Cx \u2282 E 2 are families of smooth curves\nand (as we will see below) that the level sets Z = u0 are smooth null surfaces of\nthe induced metric in the 3-dim solution space.\nIt also follows from the above assumption that these formalisms are not capable to include the caustics that null surfaces necessarily possess [6, 15, 16] .\nMoreover, one might foresee that the families of cuts that yield these null surfaces with caustics will also fail to be smooth, developing self-intersections and\nsingular points. Thus, in this section, we are faced with the problem of generalizing the geometric constructions presented in the previous section to include the\ndescription of singularities of both, cuts and null hypersurfaces.\nOur starting assumption is that the cuts develop caustics in the 2-dim space.\nTechnically this means that cuts are projections onto E 2 of a (smooth) Legendrian\nsubmanifold and the caustics arise where the projection map fails to be one to\none. In a similar way as in [17], we use a generating function to describe a cut\nin the neighborhood of a caustic. Using this function we will be able to see\nhow \u039b diverges at a caustic point. Since the original equation and the metricity\ncondition become useless around that point, we will obtain a regularized metricity\ncondition to select the class of generating functions which yield conformal metrics\non the solution space. We will also show that caustics come inseparably paired\nin the Cartan and NSF constructions, in the sense that the existence of caustics\nin the cut implies the same singular behavior in the null surfaces of the manifold\n10\n\n\fE 3 (and viceversa). The section ends with an example of a generating function\nin a minkowskian space-time.\n\n3.1\n\nThe generating function\n\nThe regular solutions of (17) can be used to define smooth curves on the so called\nprojective cotangent space of E 2 with local coordinates (u, \u03c6, \u03c0), where \u03c0 is the\nmomentum canonically conjugated to \u03c6. The curves are given by\nu = Z(xa ; p),\n\u03c6 = p,\ndZ\n\u03c0 =\n,\ndp\nwith xa parameters to be interpreted as coordinates in the solution space. These\nsmooth curves are called Legendrian submanifolds and the projection of these\nsubmanifolds onto the space (u, \u03c6) gives the local description of the cuts of E 2 .\nThe above equations describe the Legendrian submanifolds in the diffeomorphic\nregion since the coordinate \u03c6 is used as a parameter to describe these curves.\nIn order to describe the cuts in regions containing caustic points, we introduce\na generating function of the form G = G(xa ; p). In this case the Legendrian\nsubmanifold is given locally as\nu = G \u2212 p G\u2032 ,\n\u03c6 = \u2212 G\u2032 ,\n\u03c0 = p,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere G\u2032 denotes the derivative of G with respect to p holding xa fixed. The above\nequations locally describe smooth curves on the projective cotangent space of E 2 .\nNote that the projection of these curves onto the space (u, \u03c6) is not necessarily\na diffeomorphism, since \u03c6 fails to be injective in p when G\u2032\u2032 vanishes. Therefore,\nthis description includes caustic points in a natural way. It is easy to see that \u039b\ndiverges at the caustic points. For this we analyze the behavior of the coordinates\n(u, \u03c9, r, \u03c6) and the function \u039b as we approach a caustic in E 2 . These variables,\nexpressed in terms of G and p, become\n\n11\n\n\fu = G \u2212 pG\u2032 ,\ndu\n= p,\n\u03c9 =\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c9\n\u22121\nr =\n= \u2212 (G\u2032\u2032 ) ,\nd\u03c6\nand since \u039b =\n\nd3 u\nwe obtain\nd3 \u03c6\n\u039b=\n\n(22)\n\n\u2212G\u2032\u2032\u2032\n.\n(G\u2032\u2032 )3\n\nSince at a caustic point G\u2032\u2032 = 0, we see from equations (22) that both u and \u03c9\nare bounded while r and \u039b diverge at that point. One might argue that G could\nbe such that G\u2032\u2032\u2032 also vanishes at a caustic point in such a way that \u039b remains\nfinite. However, smoothness requires G to be expandable as a polynomial around\na caustic point. Thus G\u2032\u2032\u2032 is always a polynomial of lower degree than G\u2032\u2032 and\nthe previous argument does not apply. It follows from these considerations that\na) the third order ODE (17) will not be defined around caustic points and b)\nthe coordinate system, metric construction and metricity condition will not be\nregular on the 3-dim solution space.\nWe look then for a regular third order ODE where the right hand side of this\nequation satisfies a regularized metricity condition. For this we introduce a new\nset of coordinates (G, G\u2032 , G\u2032\u2032 , p). In terms of these coordinates we have\nG\u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u039b\u0303(G, G\u2032 , G\u2032\u2032 , p) = \u2212 (G\u2032\u2032 )3 \u039b(G \u2212 pG\u2032 , p, \u2212(G\u2032\u2032 )\u22121 , \u2212G\u2032 )\ne = 0 becomes\nand the metricity condition M\u0303 [\u039b]\ne\nM\u0303 [\u039b]\n\n= G\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2(\u039b\u0303p + G \u039b\u0303G )\u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032\n\nd\nd\u039b\u0303\n\u2212 3\u039b\u0303 \u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 \u2212 5 \u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 + 2\u039b\u0303(\u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 )2\ndp\ndp\n!\n\n!\n\nd2\u039b\u0303\nd\nd\n3 2 \u2212 3 (\u039b\u0303p + G\u2032 \u039b\u0303G ) + (G\u2032\u2032 )2 2\u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 \u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 \u2212 6\u039b\u0303G\ndp\ndp\ndp\n\n+ G\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 2\n\n\u2212 (G )\n\n!\n\n!\n\n4\nd2\nd\u039b\u0303\n(\u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 )3 + 2 \u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 + 3\u039b\u0303 (\u039b\u0303p + G\u2032 \u039b\u0303G ) + \u039b\u0303\u039b\u0303G\u2032\u2032 \u2212\n9\ndp\ndp\n\n(23)\n!\n\n= 0,\n\n= Fp + G\u2032 FG + G\u2032\u2032 FG\u2032 + \u039b\u0303 FG\u2032\u2032 for any function F (G, G\u2032, G\u2032\u2032 , p). Note\nwhere dF\ndp\nthat the above equation is regular in a neighborhood of the caustic (G\u2032\u2032 = 0).\n12\n\n\fFinally, to obtain null surfaces and study them near a caustic, we proceed in\ne = 0.\na similar way as we did in the diffeormophic region, i.e. we first solve M\u0303 [\u039b]\nDenoting by \u039b\u03030 a particular solution to this equation we then generate solutions\nof the ordinary differential equation\nG\u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u039b\u03030 (G, G\u2032 , G\u2032\u2032 , p),\n\n(24)\n\nand construct families of curves with caustics on E 2 .\nRemark 3.1 Note that in the (G, p) space the solutions to (24) will generate\nsmooth curves. To construct the families of curves with caustics one must use G\nas the generating function of the contact transformation (21) and the null surfaces\nare given by the conditions u = const., \u03c6 = const.\nRemark 3.2 Note that the contact transformation (21) induces a coordinate\ntransformation (22) which preserves the metric tensor defined on E 3 . Thus, Cartan's theorem 2.1 is immediately generalized to include coordinate and contact\ntransformations on E 2 .\n\n3.2\n\nCaustics on null surfaces and cuts\n\nIn this subsection, we prove that the existence of caustic points in the cuts\nyields the existence of caustic points in the null surfaces of E 3 and viceversa. As\nit is known ([5]), the divergence of a congruence of null geodesics \u03c1 = \u2212\u2207a la\n(la = g ab \u2207a Z) becomes infinite at a caustic. Therefore, to prove our assertions,\nwe will derive a relation between \u03c1 of a congruence contained in the null surface\nand the scalar Z \u2032\u2032 (xa , \u03c6) constructed from the general solution u = Z(xa , \u03c6) to\n(17) .\nLet la be the tangent vector to a geodesic with affine parameter \u03c4 , then\nla =\n\ndxa\n= g ab \u03b80 b = \u03a92 \u03b82 a ,\nd\u03c4\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03b8 i b and \u03b8j a are the form-basis and its corresponding dual vector-basis\nassociated with the canonical coordinate system (8).\nTo this tangent vector we associate a triad {la , ma , na } parallely propagated\nalong the geodesic satisfying\nma ma = 1,\n\nna na = 0,\n\nla ma = 0,\n13\n\nla na = \u22121 and na ma = 0.\n\n\fIn this frame the metric tensor and the divergence become\ngab = ma mb \u2212 2 n(a lb)\n\n\u03c1 = ma mb \u2207a lb\n\nand\n\nrespectively. Since \u03b81 a and \u03b82 a are coordinate vectors they satisfy\n\u03b82 a \u2207a \u03b81 b = \u03b81 a \u2207a \u03b82 b .\n\n(26)\n\nExpresing the geodesic deviation vector \u03b81 a in terms of the triad\n\u03b81 a = \u03bema + \u03b1la ,\n\n(27)\n\nin (26) gives\nla \u2207a \u03be = \u03bema mb \u2207a lb = \u03be \u03c1\nor equivalently\n\nd\u03be\n.\n(28)\nd\u03c4\nOn the other hand we can easily derive a differential equation for the divergence\nby considering the geodesic deviation equation as follows:\n\u03c1 = \u03be \u22121\n\nmc la \u2207a (\u03b81 b \u2207b lc ) = mc \u03b81 a \u2207a (lb \u2207b lc ) + \u03beRabd c la mb ld mc .\nSince la is a tangent vector of a null geodesic and the triad is parallely propagated\nalong it, using (27) we obtain\nmc la \u2207a (\u03bemb \u2207b lc ) =\n\nd\u03c1\nd\u03be\n\u03c1+\u03be\n= \u03be\u03a6,\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\nwith \u03a6 = Rabd c la mb ld mc . Finally, from (28 ), we see that \u03c1 must satisfy the\ndifferential equation\nd\u03c1\n+ \u03c12 = \u03a6.\n(29)\nd\u03c4\nTo prove our claims we start with the general solution u = Z(xa , \u03c6) to (17),\nand we assume that the cut u = Z(xa0 , \u03c6) has a caustic at \u03c6 = \u03c60 . As we have seen\nin the previous subsection, this is equivalent to say that the function Z \u2032\u2032 (xa0 , \u03c6)\ndiverges at \u03c60 . To show that there is a caustic in the null surface defined by\nZ(xa , \u03c60 ) = Z(xa0 , \u03c60 ) = u0 , we must prove that lim \u03c1 = \u221e, with r = Z \u2032\u2032 (xa , \u03c60 ).\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n14\n\n\fFrom (25) it follows that\nd\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u03a92\n= \u2212\u03a92 s2 ,\nd\u03c4\n\u2202r\n\u2202s\n\u2202\nare regular operators near s = 0,\nwith the coordinate s = r \u22121 . As d\u03c4d and \u2202s\n2 2\nthe factor \u03a9 s must be a non zero smooth function of s. Hence \u03a9 = O(s\u22121 ),\nmeaning that the conformal factor \u03a9 diverges when we approach a caustic in the\ncut.\nFinally, noting that g11 = gab \u03b81 a \u03b81 b , we express \u03be in terms of the conformal\nfactor in the following manner\n\ng11 = \u03a9\u22122 = gab (\u03bema + \u03b1la )(\u03bemb + \u03b1lb ) = \u03be 2 ,\ntherefore\n\u03c1=\n\nd\n\u2202\nln \u03a9 = \u2212\u03a92 s2 ln \u03a9\nd\u03c4\n\u2202s\n\nwhich yields\n\u03c1 = O(s\u22121 ).\nWe conclude that when s goes to zero (in a singular point of the cut) \u03c1 diverges,\ni.e. we approach a caustic of the null surface.\nIt remains now to prove that a caustic in the null surface leads to the same\nsingular behaviour in the cut. Suppose that the null surface is defined by u0 =\nZ(xa , \u03c60 ), then near a caustic point xa0 in the surface the solution of the differential\nequation (29) in the flat case yields\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n,\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40\n\nwhere the singular point xa0 corresponds to \u03c4 = \u03c40 . By means of (28) we find\n\u03be = \u03a9\u22121 = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 , thus the conformal factor \u03a9 diverges when we approach a\ncaustic in the null surface and since d\u03c4 = \u03a9\u22122 dr, r diverges (for \u03c4 is the affine\nparameter of the curve and so d\u03c4 is bounded) at xa0 .\nOn the other hand we know that u = Z(xa0 , \u03c6) is a solution of (17), then at the\nsingular point xa0 the function r = Z \u2032\u2032 (xa0 , \u03c60) diverges. Thus, the cut u = Z(xa0 , \u03c6)\nalso has a caustic point at \u03c6 = \u03c60 .\nRemark 3.3 Note that the spaces E 2 and E 3 , used to describe the cuts and null\nsurfaces respectively, are not related in any way. The only tool that was used to\n15\n\n\fprove the above results relating the cuts with null surfaces is the starting ODE\n(17). This is in contrast with similar results obtained in 3 and 4 dimensions\nwhere the reciprocity theorem for null congruences and the assumption that E 2 is\na hypersurface of E 3 is explicitly used in the proof [4].\n\n3.3\n\nAn example: caustics in flat space\n\nAn arbitrary constant function is clearly a solution of the metricity condition\ne = 0, which yields a polynomial of third degree in p for G. Therefore we\nM\u0303 [\u039b]\ne = \u22121 and (24) yields\nchoose \u039b\n\np3 1 1 2\n+ X p + X 2p + X 3.\n3\n2\nWith this generating function the Legendre submanifold is given parametrically by\n2 3 1 1 2\np \u2212 X p + X 2,\n(30)\nu =\n3\n2\n\u03c6 = p2 \u2212 X 1 p \u2212 X 2 ,\n(31)\np = p.\n(32)\nG(p, xa ) = \u2212\n\nThe projection of this submanifold onto E 2 , (u, \u03c6, p) \u2192 (u, \u03c6), is the cut and\npossesses a cusp-like caustic when p = X 1 /2 (see figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Legendre submanifold and the corresponding cut for X 1 = X 2 = X 3 = 0.\nSince \u03c6 is not an injective function of p, there are two values of p for each \u03c6,\nnamely\n1\n1q 1 2\n(X ) + 4\u03c6 + 4X 2 .\n(33)\np(\u03c6) = X 1 \u00b1\n2\n2\n16\n\n\fInserting this expression into equation (30) we obtain the corresponding spacetime coordinates\n\u00113/2\n1 \u0010 1 2\n1\n1\n1\n3\nu =\n(X ) + 4 \u03c6 + 4 X 2\n+\n(X 1 ) + X 1 \u03c6 + X 1 X 2 + X 3\n12\n12\n2\n2\n1 1 1q 1 2\n(34)\nX +\n(X ) + 4 \u03c6 + 4 X 2\n\u03c9 =\n2\n2\n1\nr = q\n.\n2\n(X 1 ) + 4 \u03c6 + 4 X 2\nq\n\nIt is clear from (33) that (X 1 )2 + 4\u03c6 + 4X 2 becomes null in the caustic,\nhence r diverges while u and \u03c9 remain bounded at this point.\nFigure 2 shows a null surface and null geodesics on it for (u, \u03c6) = (0, 0), which\nend tangent to the caustic curve. The above generating function gives \u039b = \u2212r 3 ,\n\nFigure 2: Null surface for (u, \u03c6) = (0, 0).\nwhich yields a flat metric for the conformal factor \u03a9 = r.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown in this work how the 3-dim NSF can be recast in terms of a\nwell known mathematical frame, like Cartan's geometrical theory of differential\nequations. In this manner, the metricity condition of NSF becomes a simple\ngeometric imposition within the Cartan's framework, namely the vanishing of\nthe torsion of the connection in the space E 4 .\nMoreover, both constructions have been extended from their local scopes to\nthe non-differentiable regions, in order to account for the singular behavior that\nnull surfaces necessarily possess. As result of this extension,\n17\n\n\f\u2022 a generalized version of the metricity condition was obtained, whose solutions yield null foliations of a 2+1 dimensional manifold with caustics and\nother singularities that the local construction of NSF by definition is not\ncapable to describe.\n\u2022 the singularities of cuts and null surfaces were shown to be closely related\nin the sense that the singular behavior in one of them induces a similar\nbehaviour in the other.\nAt this point, one can think of applying the same ideas of this work to the\noriginal 4-dim version of NSF [7, 18]. This would imply a change from ordinary\ndifferential equations over partial ones, since the variable Z now depends on two\ncoordinates (\u03b1, \u03b2) on S 2 and is subject to the following system of PDEs:\nZ\u03b1\u03b1 = \u039b(\u03b1, \u03b2, Z, Z\u03b1, Z\u03b2 , Z\u03b1\u03b2 ),\n\n(35)\n\nZ\u03b2\u03b2 = \u03a5(\u03b1, \u03b2, Z, Z\u03b1, Z\u03b2 , Z\u03b1\u03b2 ),\n\n(36)\n\nwhere Z\u03b1 , Z\u03b2 are the partial derivatives of Z with respect to the coordinates. Since\nthe above system of equations is integrable, its solution space can be parametrized\nby four constants xa , which locally define the 4-dim solution space M. Thus, one\nwould be able in principle to construct an S 2 bundle over M and attach a similar\nset of geometric structures that have been presented in this paper.\nIf this program can be done, the NSF could be described within a well established context of differential equations; one would be able to give a geometrical\ninterpretation to the metricity conditions (possibly in terms of requirements analog to the vanishing of the torsion).\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research has been partially supported by AIT, CONICET, CONICOR, and\nUNC.
