By far its\nmost well known application is quantum key distribution\nthrough which a secret random key can be established\nbetween distant parties with its security guaranteed by\nquantum mechanics [1, 2]. In quantum key distribution,\na quantum state prepared by one party only needs to be\nmeasured by another party at a distance. For this purpose, photons are very well suited as they easily travel\nlong distances through optical fibres or empty space and\ncan be readily measured by a receiving party. Increasingly, however, the pivotal importance of quantum communication in a different area of quantum information\nprocessing, namely quantum computation, is becoming\nclear. It is becoming important for connecting up distinct quantum processors or registers to make a powerful\nquantum computer [3, 4, 5]. For this application, it is\nnot only important to transfer a quantum state between\nlocations but also to map it from/to the elements of the\nquantum register sending/receiving it. This necessitates\nsimple exchange of quantum information between the elements of a quantum computer and the entities carrying\nthe information between the computers. Moreover the\ntransfer is needed only over short distances separating\ndistinct registers. For such short distance applications,\nwhere mapping of the transferred quantum state to the\nelements of a register is also important, it is very useful\nto have alternatives to photons [3, 5]. This review article\nwill be based on one such alternative, where the quantum\nstate transfer is accomplished purely through the natural\ndynamical evolution of a permanently coupled chain of\nquantum systems, which has recently drawn considerable\nattention [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,\n36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,\n52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. We start by\nhighlighting the importance of short distance quantum\ncommunications in quantum computation and why nonphotonic alternatives are important to pursue. At this\npoint it is worth mentioning that dynamics is certainly\n\nnot the only way to transfer a quantum state through a\nchain of permanently coupled quantum systems. Stationary states (such as thermal and ground states) of manybody systems have been studied from the quantum information theoretic viewpoint for quite a while (see, for\nexample, Refs.[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]) and recently it was\nrealized that certain classes of such chains accomplish\nthe perfect transfer of a quantum state through measurements [69], while certain other classes can accomplish the\nsame even without measurements [70, 71]. However, in\nthis review, I will concentrate only on the literature on\nthe use of spin chain dynamics for quantum communications.\n\nA.\n\nQuantum Communication for Connecting\nQuantum Registers/Computers:\n\nQuantum Computers, when realized, hold the promise\nof speeding up the solution of certain problems perceived\nas difficult on a classical computer [72, 73, 74, 75]. They\nalso hold the promise of enabling controlled simulations\nof the behaviour of complex quantum systems [75, 76].\nThe typical quantum computer is regarded as a collection\nof quantum two state systems (or \"qubits\") on which arbitrary unitary operations can be performed, as for example shown in Fig.1. The power of a quantum computer\nincreases with the number of qubits. However, there are\nseveral fundamental obstacles to increasing the number\nof qubits in a quantum computer arbitrarily. For example, the computer may be based on a common bus\nthrough which the qubits interact [77, 78, 79], as depicted in Fig.1. Then there is a physical limitation on the\nnumber of qubits which can be linked by the same bus.\nAlternatively, if the computer is based on direct interactions between qubits [80, 81, 82], as also shown in Fig.1,\nthen either the qubits have to be moved close enough to\ninteract, or the states they bear have to be transferred to\nqubits which are already within the range of each other's\ninteraction. Thus the size of an individual quantum computer will be limited by the need to maximize efficiency.\nOne way to get around the above problems is to envisage\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: The figure shows a typical quantum computer. The\nspheres with arrows denote qubits such as spin-1/2 systems.\nTypically operations on individual qubits are required, and\naccomplished by local fields on individual qubits, as shown,\nfor example, by the long arrow controlling qubit 6. Moreover, any pair of qubits are required to interact with each\nother. This can take place through a common bus. For example, qubits 5 and 8 are shown to be interacting through\nthe common bus B. Naturally, the number of qubits which\ncan be accommodated on a single bus is limited, and this restricts the size of feasible computers. An alternate strategy,\nin computers without a common bus mode is to make qubits\ninteract directly. In those cases, if one intends to make joint\noperations between distant qubits, then their states have to\nbe transferred to neighbouring qubits, such as qubits 1 and\n2, and then these qubits will be made to interact, as shown.\nFor efficient functioning of the computer, the time-scale of the\ntransfer must be restricted, which again limits the size of the\ncomputer.\n\na quantum computer composed of a number of quantum registers connected to each other by quantum communication channels (which could effectively be physical\nshuttling of qubits [3, 5]). Most operations would take\nplace between qubits of the same register through, say, a\ncommon bus mode, or direct interactions together with\nvery fast qubit transfers within the register. Occasionally, the quantum channels would be used to transfer\nqubits from one register to another, and thereby enable\nquantum gates between qubits of different registers. In\ncontrast to the quantum channels required for quantum\nkey distribution, these channels inside a quantum computer could be very short and should allow significant pre\nand post processing of the quantum state communicated\nthrough the channel in the transmitting and receiving\nregisters.\nEven if we are able to scale up quantum computers by\nsome technology which does not require internal communication channels, such channels will still be necessary\nto hook up distinct quantum computers. For reasons of\n\nFIG. 2: The usual approach to connecting quantum processors. Quantum information stored in the stationary (blue)\nqubits of one register is mapped to a mobile (red) qubit. This\nqubit flies to the other register, where the information stored\nin it is mapped on to the stationary (blue) qubits of that\nregister.\n\ncompactness, mobility and cost, we might just prefer to\nhave small sized quantum computers. However at times\none may need to tackle very complex problems for which\nthe power of a single quantum computer will not suffice.\nIt will then become very important to combine the processing powers of distinct quantum computers to obtain a\ncomputer with a greater processing power. Again, in contrast to the photonic channels currently being used for\nquantum key distribution, these need not be long (the\ncomputers could be sitting next to each other). Moreover, as the channel connects quantum computers, some\nencoding and decoding of the state should easily be possible inside the quantum computers. The transmitted state\n(after decoding, if applicable) should be transferable to a\nqubit or a group of qubits of the quantum computer that\nreceives it.\n\nB. An unmodulated chain of quantum systems as a\ncommunication channel between quantum computers\n\nThe usual approach envisaged for connecting quantum\ncomputers (or processors) is to first map the state to be\ntransmitted from the qubits of one processor to a flying\nor mobile qubit. This flying qubit then traverses through\na channel and reaches a second processor, where its state\nis mapped on to the qubits of that processor. The usual\napproach is depicted in Fig.2. However, depending on the\nphysical nature of the qubits of the processors, this approach could involve either (a) interfacing between different physical systems such as stationary spins and photons\n[83] or stationary and mobile spins [84] or (b) physically\n\n\f3\nmoving a quantum system and subsequently bringing it\nto a halt elsewhere such as shuttling ions [3] or electrons\n[5]. All the above can be complicated in many respects.\nSo one can ask the question: is it possible to transfer\nquantum information from place to place using only stationary qubits? The first idea that comes to mind is to\nhave a chain of qubits as shown in Fig.3, and swap a\nquantum state perfectly in succession from one qubit to\nthe next. A quantum state encoded on a qubit at one end\nof the line can be transported perfectly through a series\nof swaps to the qubit at the opposite end of the line. For\nexample, in Fig.3, the strategy is to swap state in the following order: A \u2192 1, 1 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 3, 3 \u2192 4, 4 \u2192 5, 5 \u2192 B.\nThis kind of data-bus, called a swapping channel, has\nbeen discussed, for example, in Ref.[85]. However, such\na data-bus requires the ability to modulate the strength\nor nature of interactions between pairs of adjacent qubits\n(such as 1 and 2 or 3 and 4) in time. Typically, this would\nrequire control fields on the wire varying over the scale\nof the spacing between the qubits. If so much control is\navailable on a chain of qubits, then why not use the chain\nas a quantum computer? It will then be a gross underutilization to use it merely as a data-bus. Moreover, the\nrequirement of so much control for the transfer of a quantum state naturally implies that such a protocol is also\nvery susceptible to errors in these controls. For example,\nthere are 6 pair-wise interactions to be switched on and\noff in succession for transmission of the state of qubit A\nto that of qubit B in Fig.2, and errors would accumulate in each of these steps. Thus the question arises as\nto whether we can utilize systems with much lower controls for connecting quantum registers. For example, if\nthe interactions between qubits in a chain are permanent\nand uncontrollable (always on and constant in strength),\nand we are not allowed to apply any control fields to the\nqubits, could the chain still act as a quantum data-bus?\nThe validity of the above possibility will enable us to\nuse such a qubit chain as a data-bus in the true sense\nof word. This is because in the normal everyday use of\nthe word \"data-bus\", such as to denote a cable connecting two computers, we do not envisage controlling every\nindividual part of the cable and we mostly let the information flow through it in its own natural way. A qubit\nchain in which inter-qubit interactions are permanent, is\nan example of a spin chain, which we introduce below.\n\nC.\n\nSpin chains and the exchange interaction\n\nAs the reader will know, in quantum mechanics, spins\nare systems endowed with tiny quantized magnetic moments. Bulk materials often have a large collection of\nspins permanently coupled to each other. The mutual\ninteractions of a of these spins makes them prefer alignment or anti-alignment with respect to each other, resulting in diverse phenomena such as ferromagnetism and\nanti-ferromagnetism. A spin chain models a large class of\nsuch materials in which the spins are arranged in a one di-\n\nFIG. 3: This figure depicts the possibility of transporting\nquantum information from one quantum processor to another\nthrough a line of stationary qubits.\n\nmensional lattice and permanently coupled to each other,\nusually with an interaction strength decreasing with distance (as shown in Fig.4). A common form of the Hamiltonian for the interaction between the ith and the jth\nspin is written as\n~ i .S\n~j ,\nHij = Jij S\n\n(1)\n\n~ i .S\n~j \u2261 S x S x + S y S y + S z S z and S x , S y , S z are\nwhere S\ni j\ni\ni\ni j\ni\ni j\nthe operators for the component of the ith spin along the\nx, y and z directions respectively. In particular, when all\nthe spins are spin-1/2 systems, S x , S y and S z stand for\nthe familiar Pauli matrices \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y and \u03c3 z . A Hamiltonian\nof the above form is termed as an exchange interaction\nas it can arise in from the pure exchange electrons between neighbouring ions in a metal. It is also called the\nHeisenberg interaction after its inventor. In particular,\nthe specific Hamiltonian we have written above is called\nthe isotropic exchange interaction. In this paper we will\nalso encounter a variant of the above interaction\nHXY\n= Jij (Six Sjx + Siy Sjy ),\nij\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is called the XY interaction. We will be primarily\nconcerned with chains of spin-1/2 systems in this article.\nNot only do examples of such systems exist in nature\n[86], but also can be fabricated in systems of any kind of\nqubits [25, 42, 51], as qubits are isomorphic to spin-1/2\nsystems. If one indeed fabricates artificial systems, why\nwould one fabricate a spin chain i.e., a system with permanent couplings rather than a system where such couplings are also switchable? The obvious answer is that\nsuch a system should have a much lower complexity of\nfabrication because they do not require the an attached\nmechanism (such as electrodes) varying over the scale of\nthe separation of the qubits to modulate their interactions.\n\n\f4\nfew faulty qubits in the array (faulty means that they decohere significantly in the time-scale of the experiment),\nthen the quality of the state transmission will be much\nlower than that expected for a fault-less array. Thus\nquantum communication through an array of qubits can\nenable a quality test of the entire array by just probing\ntwo of the qubits.\n\nE.\n\nFIG. 4: The figure shows a spin chain: a system of spins perpetually coupled to each other with an interaction strength\nwhich generally decreases with distance. The double arrowed lines depict interactions with the dotted line denoting\na weaker strength than the solid line.\n\nD.\n\nQuality check for a qubit array\n\nWe now provide a couple of other motivations for\nstudying quantum communications through a spin chain,\nquite distinct to the simple aim of connecting quantum\nregisters. Suppose a linear array of qubits has been fabricated to function as a quantum computer. One then\nneeds to check whether each qubit behaves as a bonafide\nqubit: namely they are able to remain in a quantum superposition of two distinct states for a time longer than\nthat needed for running an entire quantum algorithm in\nthe computer. Such superpositions may be destroyed by\nthe interaction of a qubit with its environment, a process known as decoherence. The most straightforward\nstrategy will be to probe each qubit individually by first\nswitching off a qubit's interactions with adjacent qubits,\ninitializing it in a known state and then applying a set of\nknown unitary operations to it and measuring its state\nat the end. This strategy is very time consuming for a\nlong array. An easier way is just to test the ability of\nthe array to behave as quantum communication channel. One has to place a known quantum state on the\nqubit at one end of an array, switch on the interactions\nof each qubit with its immediate neighbours (so that the\nqubit array is now isomorphic to a spin chain with nearest neighbour interactions) and probe how well the state\nis retrieved from the other end after a specified interval\nof time. This requires initialization and measurements\non only the two qubits at the ends of the array. As the\nquantum state has to pass through all the intermediate\nqubits in order to be transmitted from one end of a linear\narray to another, the ability of each qubit to behave as\na bonafide qubit is automatically tested. If there are a\n\nQuantum response to a quantum impulse\n\nTypically, one characterizes the behaviour of complex\nsystems by how it responds to external stimuli. Usually\na classical field is applied to some part of the system and\nthe resulting change in the value of some variable at a\ndifferent part of the system is determined. For example,\none can characterize magnetic systems by their magnetic\nsusceptibility, which can determine how a magnetic field\napplied to one part of the system affects the magnetization in a different part of the system. Knowledge of this\nresponse enables the design of components which may\nuse the magnetic system under consideration. In recent\nyears, our ability to manipulate and measure single quantum systems have improved. It thus makes sense to speak\nabout a fully quantum counterpart of the usually studied\nstimulus and response. We provide a quantum stimulus\nby placing a quantum state at one part of a complex system and study its quantum response: the quantum state\nproduced at another part of the system after some time\nas a result of the placement. Quantum communication\nthrough a spin chain can be regarded as a specific example of the above study, where one puts a quantum state\nat one end of a specific complex system (namely the spin\nchain) and looks at how well the spin at the other end of\nthe chain resembles that state as a function of time.\n\nII.\n\nTHE SIMPLEST SPIN CHAIN QUANTUM\nCOMMUNICATION PROTOCOL\n\nWe will now present the simplest spin chain communication protocol that one can envisage and analyse its\nperformance. The simplest possible spin chain is one\ncomposed of the lowest dimensional spin systems, namely\nspin-1/2 systems or qubits (so that the operators S x , S y\nand S z can be replaced by the familiar Pauli matrices\n\u03c3 x , \u03c3 y and \u03c3 z ). We also want to start our protocol with\nthe spin chain initialized in a very simple state, such as\none in which all spins are in the same pure state, say\n|0i. We will have to choose the couplings Jij in Eq.(1)\nin such a manner that initialization of the spin chain to\nsuch a state is easy. Accordingly, we choose Jij < 0,\nwhich means that the spin chain describes a ferromagnet. The ground state of a ferromagnet in a magnetic\nfield, however weak, is one where all spins point in the\ndirection of the field. For example, all spins could be\npointing down. In the simplest quantum communication\nprotocol, Alice places an arbitrary quantum state at one\n\n\f5\nwhich is always between 0 and 1, with higher value meaning better transfer (it is unity for perfect transfer). A\nfidelity of 2/3 can already be obtained if Alice simply\nmeasured her state, communicated the results classically\nto Bob and Bob simply reconstructed the state from this\ndata. Thus F needs to be greater than 2/3 in our spin\nchain quantum communication scheme to be better than\nstraightforward classical communication. Later, we will\nshow that the use of another figure of merit, namely the\namount of entanglement that can be transmitted by a\nspin chain, aids in the the justification that spin chains\nof arbitrary length are interesting as quantum communication channels.\n\nB.\nFIG. 5: The simplest spin chain communication protocol. A\nspin-1/2 ferromagnetic spin chain with all spins facing down\nis the quantum channel. Alice simply places a quantum state\nat one end of the chain and Bob simply picks up a close approximation of this state from his end of the spin chain after\nwaiting a while.\n\nend of the spin chain in such a \"all down\" state. This\nis depicted in the upper part of Fig.5, where Alice has\nplaced an arbitrary state on the first spin of the chain,\nwhile all the other spins are still in the down state. Due\nto the natural evolution of the chain this state both disperses and propagates along the chain. As a result of\nthis evolution, the state of the spin at Bob's end of the\nchain will vary with time. Bob now chooses an optimal\nmoment of time in as long an interval that he can afford\nto wait to receive Alice's state. This moment of time is\ncarefully chosen so that the state of the spin at Bob's end\nof the chain is as close as possible to the one that Alice\nintended to transmit. At this optimum time, Bob simply\npicks up the spin at his end of the chain, to conclude the\ncommunication protocol.\n\nA.\n\nFidelity as a figure of merit\n\nIn order to judge how well a quantum state is transferred by a spin chain one has to use a figure of merit.\nSuppose the state that Alice places into the spin at her\nend of the chain is depicted by |\u03c8in i and the state of\nthe spin that Bob picks up at the optimum time t0 is\ndepicted in general by the density operator \u03c1out (t0 ) (the\noutput state is depicted by a density operator to allow\nfor the possibility for it to be a mixed state). Then a\nmeasure of the quality of the transfer is defined by the\nfidelity\nF = h\u03c8in |\u03c1out (t0 )|\u03c8in i,\n\n(3)\n\nGeneral formula for fidelity for arbitrary graphs\n\nI will first present the scheme in a general setting for\narbitrary graphs of spins with ferromagnetic Heisenberg\ninteractions and later proceed to the special cases motivated by realizability. Say there are N spins in the graph\nand these are numbered 1, 2, ..., N . The Hamiltonian is\ngiven by\nHG = \u2212\n\nX\n<i,j>\n\nJij ~\u03c3 i .~\u03c3 j \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nBi \u03c3zi .\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\ni\n~\u03c3 i = (\u03c3xi , \u03c3yi , \u03c3zi ) in which \u03c3x/y/z\nare the Pauli matrices for the ith spin, Bi > 0 are static magnetic fields\nand Jij > 0 are coupling strengths, and < i, j > represents pairs of spins. HG describes an arbitrary ferromagnet with isotropic Heisenberg interactions. As mentioned above we initialize the graph in its ground state\n|0i = |000...0i where |0i denotes the spin down state\n(i.e., spin aligned along \u2212z direction) of a spin. This\ncan be accomplished easily for a ferromagnetic system\nby cooling. We will set the ground state energy E0 = 0\n(i.e., redefine HG as E0 + HG ) for the rest of this paper.\nWe also introduce the class of states |ji = |00...010....0i\n(where j = 1, 2, ..s, ..r, .., N) in which the spin at the jth\nsite has been flipped to the |1i state. We now assume\nthat the state sender Alice is located closest to the sth\n(sender) spin and the state receiver Bob is located closest to the rth (receiver) spin. All the other spins will\nbe called channel spins. As mentioned before, to start\nthe protocol, Alice simply places the state she wants to\ntransmit to Bob on the sth spin at time t = 0. Let this\nstate be |\u03c8in i = cos (\u03b8/2)|0i + ei\u03c6 sin (\u03b8/2)|1i. We can\nthen describe the state of the whole chain at this instant\n(time t = 0) as\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n|\u03a8(0)i = cos |0i + ei\u03c6 sin |si.\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nBob now waits for a specific time till the initial state\n|\u03a8(0)i evolves to a final state which is as close as possible\nPN\nto cos 2\u03b8 |0i+ei\u03c6 sin 2\u03b8 |ri. As [HG , i=1 \u03c3zi ] = 0, the state\n\n\f6\n|si only evolves to states |ji and the evolution of the spingraph (with h\u0304 = 1) is\nN\n\n\u03b8 X \u2212iHG t\n\u03b8\nhj|e\n|si|ji.\n|\u03a8(t)i = cos |0i + ei\u03c6 sin\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nj=1\n\nThe state of the rth spin will, in general, be a mixed state,\nand can be obtained by tracing off the states of all other\nspins from |\u03a8(t)i. Undergraduate readers can familiarize themselves with this tracing procedure called partial\ntracing from quantum information textbooks [75], but essentially the density operator \u03c1out of the output state is\nobtained by Tr1,2,...,N \u22121(|\u03a8(t)ih\u03a8(t)|), where Tr1,2,...,N \u22121\nmeans tracing over the states of the systems 1 to N \u2212 1.\nThis evolves with time as\n\u03c1out (t) = P (t)|\u03c8out (t)ih\u03c8out (t)| + (1 \u2212 P (t))|0ih0|, (7)\nwith\n1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n|\u03c8out (t)i = p\n(cos |0i + ei\u03c6 sin fs,r (t)|1i),\n2\n2\nP (t)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere P (t) = cos2 \u03b82 + sin2 2\u03b8 |fr,s (t)|2 and fr,s (t) =\nhr| exp {\u2212iHG t}|si. Note that fr,s (t) is just the transition amplitude of an excitation (the |1i state) from the\nsth to the rth site of a graph of N spins.\nNow suppose it is decided that Bob will pick up the\nrth spin (and hence complete the communication protocol) at a predetermined time t = t0 . The fidelity\nof quantum communication through the channel averaged over\nR all pure input states |\u03c8in i in the Bloch-sphere\n((1/4\u03c0) h\u03c8in |\u03c1out (t0 )|\u03c8in id\u03a9) is then\n|fr,s (t0 )| cos \u03b3\n|fr,s (t0 )|2\n1\nF =\n+\n+ ,\n3\n6\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = arg{fr,s (t0 )}. To maximize the above average\nfidelity, we must choose the magnetic fields Bi such that\n\u03b3 is a multiple of 2\u03c0. Assuming this special choice of\nmagnetic field value (which can always be made for any\ngiven t0 ) to be a part of our protocol, we can simply\nreplace fr,s (t0 ) by |fN,1 (t0 )| in Eq.(8).\nC.\n\nSpecifics for an open chain with nearest\nneighbour interactions\n\nAs we intend to use a graph of interacting spins as\na channel, we will use the most natural geometry for\na channel, which is a linear open ended chain (Fig.5)\nwith the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) at opposite\nends. To use an analytically solvable Hamiltonian HL we\nassume Jij = (J/2)\u03b4i+1,j (nearest neighbor interactions\nof equal strength) and Bi = B (uniform magnetic field)\nfor all i and j in Eq.(4) for HG . The eigenstates of HL ,\nrelevant to our problem are\n|m\u0303iL = am\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\ncos{\n\n\u03c0\n(m \u2212 1)(2j \u2212 1)}|ji,\n2N\n\n(10)\n\nFIG. 6: The figure shows how quantum information is transmitted down a spin chain in the simplest protocol. The chain\ngoes to a superposition of its ground state and a time evolving\nstate. The time evolving state transmits a spin flip as a series\nof wave-packets which travels towards Bob while dispersing\nat the same time.\n\np\n\u221a\nwhere m = 1, 2, ..., N , a1 = 1/ N and am6=1 = 2/N\nwith energy (on setting E0 = 0) given by Em = 2B +\n\u03c0\n(m \u2212 1)}). In this case, fr,s (t0 ) is given by\n2J(1 \u2212 cos{ N\nfr,s (t0 ) =\n\nN\nX\n\nhr|m\u0303ihm\u0303|sie\u2212iEm t0 = IDCTs (vm,r ) (11)\n\nm=1\n\n\u03c0\nwhere, vm,r = am cos { 2N\n(m \u2212 1)(2r \u2212 1)}e\u2212iEm t0 and\nPN\n\u03c0\nIDCTs (vm,r ) =\nm=1 am vm,r cos { 2N (m \u2212 1)(2s \u2212 1)}\nis the sth element of the inverse discrete cosine transform\nof the vector {vm,r }.\nWe now want to study the performance of our protocol for various chain lengths N with s = 1 and r = N\n(Alice and Bob at opposite ends of the chain as shown in\nFig.5). In general, Bob has to wait for different lengths\nof time t0 for different chain lengths N , in order to obtain\na high fidelity of quantum state transfer. The time t0 for\nthe highest fidelity in a given interval of time need not be\nrelated to N by a simple formula. Why is this so? To understand the process, view Fig.6. As shown in the figure,\nwith an amplitude of cos 2\u03b8 the spin chain remains in its\nground state, while with an amplitude ei\u03c6 sin \u03b82 the spin\nchain goes to a time evolving state in which the initial flip\nat Alice's end gets spread out (dispersed) and propagates\nas a series of waves, some propagating towards and some\naway from Bob. There is an initial high amplitude wavepacket which reaches Bob at a time of about N/J, but\nthe highest peaks of |fr,s | at Bob's side are obtained by\na constructive interference of several wave-packets. The\nspecific time t0 at which such a constructive interference\ntakes place is not necessarily given by a closed form formula.\nUsing Eqs.(9) and (11), we can numerically evaluate\n\n\f7\nN qubits described above. This means that by using a\nring one can communicate as efficiently over a distance\nr \u2212 s = N as you can with a open ended line over a\ndistance r \u2212 s = N \u2212 1. An immediate implication is\nthat a 4 spin ring allows perfect communication between\ndiametrically opposite sites (because a N = 2 spin chain\ndoes so).\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\nD.\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nIs an arbitrarily long spin chain a true quantum\nchannel?\u2013 An answer through entanglement\ndistribution\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\nN\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFIG. 7: The bar plot shows the maximum fidelity F of\nquantum communication and the curve shows the maximum sharable entanglement E achieved in a time interval\n[0, 4000/J] as a function of the chain length N from 2 to\n80. The time t0 at which this maxima is achieved varies with\nN . The straight line at F = 2/3 shows the highest fidelity for\nclassical transmission of a quantum state.\n\nthe maximum of |fN,1 (t0 )| (which corresponds to the\nmaxima of both fidelity and entanglement) for various\nchain lengths from N = 2 to N = 80 when Bob is allowed to choose t0 within a finite (but long) time interval\nof length Tmax = 4000/J. This evaluation is fast because\nEq.(11) allows us to use numerical packages for the discrete cosine transform. Taking a finite Tmax is physically\nreasonable, as Bob cannot afford to wait indefinitely. It\nis to be understood that within [0, Tmax ], the time t0\nat which optimal quantum communication occurs varies\nwith N . The maximum fidelities as a function of N and\nthe maximum amounts of entanglement sharable (both\nrounded to 3 decimal places) are shown in Fig.7.\nFig.7, shows various interesting features of our protocol. The plot also shows that in addition to the trivial\ncase of N = 2, N = 4 gives perfect (F = 1.000) quantum state transfer to 3 decimal places and N = 8 gives\nnear perfect (F = 0.994). The fidelity also exceeds 0.9\nfor N = 7, 10, 11, 13 and 14. Till N = 21 we observe\nthat the fidelities are lower when N is divisible by 3 in\ncomparison to the fidelities for N + 1 and N + 2. While\nwe do not have a clear cut explanation of this effect, it is\nobviously a link between number theory and constructive\ninterference in a line. The plot also shows that a chain\nof N as high as 80 exceeds the highest fidelity for classical transmission of the state i.e., 2/3 in the time interval\nprobed by us.\nAs an alternate system, one can also consider a ring\nof 2N spins with Alice and Bob accessing the spins at\ndiametrically opposite sites (s = 1, r = N + 1). In\nthat case, as discussed in Ref.[6] we find that the global\nmaxima of F coincides with that of the open chain of\n\nWith the results of the above section, it is not conclusive that arbitrarily long spin chains are truly \"quantum\"\nchannels. Especially if even for a long interval Tmax , a\n80 spin chain cannot transfer quantum states with a fidelity better than 2/3, then can we regard a chain of say\na 1000 spins as a quantum channel? It is true that if we\nincrease Tmax , then longer and longer chains may yield a\nfidelity better than 2/3 due to constructive interference\nat some time. But because the time is being obtained\nby an optimization over an arbitrarily large interval, this\ncannot be either proved or disproved easily.\nWe will thus consider a different figure of merit for\njudging the performance of the spin chain as a quantum\ncommunication channel, namely the amount of entanglement that can be transmitted through it. Entanglement\nis the truly \"quantum\" correlations that exist between\ntwo systems when they are in a inseparable state such as\n|\u03c8 + i = \u221a12 (|01i + |10i). The study of entanglement is a\nhuge area of quantum information science, and we refer\nthe reader to a review such as Ref.[87]. For our current\npurposes, it is sufficient to note that if Alice and Bob\nheld one member each of a pair of particles in the state\n|\u03c8 + i, then one of them could transmit a quantum state\nperfectly to the other using a celebrated protocol called\nquantum teleportation [88] (this transmission also requires some additional classical communication between\nAlice and Bob).\nIn particular, we will look at the transmission of the\nstate of one member of a pair of particles in the entangled state |\u03c8 + i through the spin chain channel. This\nis the usual procedure for sharing entanglement between\nseparated parties through any channel. Alice prepares\ntwo qubits in the state |\u03c8 + i, holds one of them (say, A)\nin her hand and places the other on site 1 of the chain.\nThis procedure of putting in one member of an entangled\nstate in a spin chain is illustrated in Fig.8. After waiting\nfor an optimal time t0 , Bob picks up the qubit N from\nthe chain. The joint state shared by Alice's qubit A and\nBob's qubit N at this time is given by\n1\n{(1 \u2212 |fr,s (t0 )|2 )|00ih00|1N\n2\n+ (|10i + |fr,s (t0 )||01i)(h10| + |fr,s (t0 )|h01|)1N }\n\n\u03c11N (t0 ) =\n\nThe entanglement E of the above state, as quantified by\n\n\f8\nended XY spin chain (Hamiltonian H XY ) the amount\nof entanglement E that can be transmitted by putting\none member of an entangled pair of particles in the spin\nchain and waiting for a time t0 = (N +0.8089N 1/3)/2J is\nprecisely twice the above amount (i.e., 2 \u00d7 1.3499N \u22121/3)\n[11].\nFIG. 8: The mechanism of transferring entanglement down a\nspin chain. The state of one member of a pair of qubits in a\nmaximally entangled state is placed on the spin at Alice's end\nof the chain, while the other member is held by Alice. After\na while, the spin at Bob's end of the chain will be entangled\nwith the qubit held by Alice.\n\na certain measure called concurrence [89] is given by\nE = |fr,s (t0 )|.\n\n(12)\n\nThus, for any non-zero fr,s (t0 ) (however small), some\nentanglement can be shared through the channel. This\nentanglement, being that of a 2 \u00d7 2 system, can also\nbe distilled [90]. Distillation is a procedure whereby, if\nseveral copies of an entangled state such as \u03c11N (t0 ) are\nshared in parallel between Alice and Bob, then it can be\nconverted to a smaller collection of pure maximally entangled states |\u03c8 + i shared between Alice and Bob. This\nprocedure requires only local actions by Alice and Bob\nand classical communication between them. These |\u03c8 + i\ncan subsequently be used for perfect transmission of a\nstate from Alice to Bob by quantum teleportation.\nWe will now like to estimate the entanglement sharable\nthrough chains so large that the optimal t0 identified by\na numerical search in a long interval of time, is not good\nenough for an average fidelity higher than 2/3. We will\nchoose t0 according to a fixed (in general, non-optimal)\nprescription and find how much entanglement can be\ntransferred through the chain. To motivate this choice,\nwe expand e\u2212iEm t0 in Eq.(11) as a Bessel function series\nto obtain\nE=|\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n(\u22121)N k (JN +2N k (\u03b20 ) + iJN +2N k (\u03b20 ))|, (13)\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03b20 = 2Jt0 .\nUsing, JN (N + \u03beN 1/3 ) \u2248\n1/3\n1/3\n(2/N ) Ai(\u22122 \u03be) for large N [118], (where Ai(.) is\nthe Airy function) we can prove that we get a maxima of\nJN (\u03b20 ) at t0 = (N + 0.8089N 1/3)/2J and at this time\nE \u2248 2|JN (\u03b20 )| \u2248 1.3499N \u22121/3,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich ranges from 0.135 for N = 1000 to 1.35 \u00d7 10\u22124 for\nN = 1012 (just 3 orders decrease in E for an increase in\nlength N by 9 orders \u2013 a very efficient way to distribute\nentanglement). Thus for any finite N , however large, the\nchain allows us to distribute entanglement of the order\nN \u22121/3 in a time t0 linear in N . An exchange coupled\nchain of any finite length is thus a bonafide quantum\nchannel. It is worthwhile to point out that for an open\n\nIII.\n\nROUTES TO PERFECTION AND NEAR\nPERFECTION\n\nThe protocols of state transfer and entanglement distribution described above were primarily motivated by\ntheir simplicity. For the purposes of checking the quality of a qubit array and studying the quantum response\nto a quantum impulse \u2013 which are both important aims,\nthese protocols should suffice. These transfer schemes,\nalthough imperfect, also already motivate the field of investigating quantum capacities of such spin chain channels [17, 48]. However, for connecting up two solid state\nquantum registers, which by far was our main motivation,\nit is only perfect or nearly perfect state transfer which is\nrelevant. For example, to do a quantum gate between\nqubits in two separate registers, one needs to transfer\nthe state of a qubit from the first register to the second perfectly, do a gate between that qubit and a qubit\nof the second register, and then transfer its state back\nto the first register perfectly. The protocols described\nabove will not accomplish these tasks on their own. The\nsecond protocol (the one where one transmits the state\nof one member of a pair of entangled qubits through the\nchannel) can be made useful when appended with entanglement distillation procedures. Basically, one has to first\nuse the spin chain channel repeatedly to make Alice and\nBob share several copies of the partially entangled state\n\u03c11N (t0 ). Then entanglement distillation is performed to\nobtain a smaller number of pairs of particles in the state\n|\u03c8 + i shared between Alice and Bob. The particles in the\nstate |\u03c8 + i can now be used to transmit a state perfectly,\ndo quantum gates between qubits in well separated locations, and so forth. Clearly, it would be better if we could\ndo perfect quantum state transfer through a spin chain\nwithout invoking an additional entanglement distillation\nprocess. With this view in mind, several schemes have\nbeen proposed which we present below.\n\nA.\n\nEngineered chains\n\nThe couplings Jij can be carefully chosen (even when\nthere are only nearest neighbor couplings, i.e., i = j \u00b1 1)\nto obtain a spin chain which accomplishes perfect quantum state transfer [9, 10, 16, 30]. We need to briefly\ndigress to one of the very first systems studied in introductory quantum mechanics, namely a particle in a box,\nto clearly understand why this is possible. Let the box be\na symmetric square well centered at x = 0 (i.e., the potential satisfies V (\u2212x) = V (x)) with infinitely high walls.\n\n\f9\nUnder these circumstances, the energy eigenstates \u03c6k (x)\nof H with k = 0, 1, ...\u221e satisfy \u03c6k (\u2212x) = (\u22121)k \u03c6k (x)\n(this property can be called alternating\nparity). The time\nP\nevolution of any state \u03c8(x) = k ck \u03c6k (x) is given by\n\u03c8(x, t) =\n\nX\n\nck e\u2212iEk t \u03c6k (x),\n\n(15)\n\nk\n\nwhere energies Ek \u221d k 2 (such energies, which are proportional to integers, can be called commensurate energies).\nIf one chooses a special time of evolution t = \u03c4 such that\nEk \u03c4 = k 2 \u03c0, then we have\n\u03c8(x, \u03c4 ) =\n\nX\nk\n\nck (\u22121)k \u03c6k (x) =\n\nX\n\nck \u03c6k (\u2212x) = \u03c8(\u2212x).\n\nk\n\n(16)\nThus there is a time \u03c4 in which the complete wavefunction mirror inverts about x = 0. This form of mirror inversion of a wave-function in an infinite square well\nhave been known for some time in the quantum optics literature [91]. The properties which have been responsible\nfor the mirror inversion detailed above are the alternating parity and the commensurate energy properties, and\nany other Hamiltonian which has the same features will\nalso exhibit the above mirror inversion.\nThere is a close analogy between the position of a particle in a line and a single spin flip in a background of\naligned spins in a spin chain. The position x of the particle is analogous to the discretized positions j = 1, .., N\nof the flip and the wavefunction\n\u03c8(x) is simply analoP\nc\n|ji.\nIf the couplings are\ngous to a superposition\nj\nj\n(a) mirror symmetric about the centre of the spin chain\n(i.e., Jj,j+1 = JN \u2212j,N \u2212j+1 ), which gives the alternating parity property, and engineered to (b) give rise to\ncommensurate energies, then at a certain time \u03c4c the\nstate will mirror\nP invert by the logic of the last paragraph,\nOne form of engineering,\ni.e., become\nj cj |N \u2212 ji.\nwhich works\nP for an open ended XY spin chain (Hamilto) with nearest neighbour interactions\nnian = j HXY\np j,j+1\nis Jj,j+1 = j(N \u2212 j), which gives Ek \u221d k [9, 10]. The\nmirror inversion implies that in a time \u03c4c a spin flip at\n1st site of the spin chain will be perfectly transferred to\nthe N th site i.e., f1N (\u03c4c ) = 1, which in turn implies perfect quantum communication and entanglement transfer\nthrough formulae of Eqs.(9) and (12). Note that engineering a spin chain to obtain a commensurate spectrum\ncan give different values of Jj,j+1 depending on the specific commensurate spectrum one chooses (such as one\ncan choose Ek \u221d k, k 2 , k(k + 1) etc.) and engineered couplings other than that mentioned above have also been\nfound [16, 33, 45]. In general, one chooses a specific\ncommensurate spectrum and then finds the corresponding couplings by solving an inverse eigenvalue problem\n[20, 22]. Thus open ended XY spin chain with nearly uniform couplings [33], and non-nearest neighbour (dipolar)\ncouplings [45], have been designed which can all accomplish perfect or near perfect quantum state transfer.\n\nB.\n\nWave-packet encoding\n\nSo far, we have been considering various protocols in\nwhich the |1i state to be transmitted by the chain is\nencoded on it as a single spin flip at one end. Remembering the analogy between positions x of a particle in a\nline and discretized positions j of a spin flip in a background of aligned spins, this is analogous to an infinitely\nnarrow wavefunction (a Dirac delta function) of a particle in a line. For typical potentials such as a particle\nin a box or a harmonic oscillator, such a wavefunction\nis known to disperse (spread) rapidly in space and thus\nthe particle's behaviour becomes very unlike that of a\nclassical particle. However, it is possible to place particles in gaussian wave-packet states which have a low\ndispersion and travel with a definite group velocity, more\nor less as a classical particle would. Then any information encoded as a superposition of the presence and absence of a particle in such a state would travel more\nor less with a well defined velocity and reach the receiver at a predetermined time. Can one try a similar\ntrick in the transmission of quantum information down\na spin chain? Such a protocol was first proposed for a\nring of N spins interacting through the Heisenberg or\nthe XY model [12], where \"truncated\" gaussian waveP\n2\n2\npacket states |G(j0 , k)i = j e\u2212(j\u2212j0 ) /L e\u2212ik0 j |ji centred at the site j = j0 (and defined over L sites around\nthe site j0 ) and with velocity \u221d k0 were used. In a block\nof L spins near a site jA , Alice encodes the |1i state of\nthe qubit she wants to transmit on |G(jA , k)i (the |0i\nis encoded as in the previous protocols). For appropriate choice of k0 (see Ref.[12]) one can choose L \u223c N 1/3 ,\nso that this wave-packet travels with a dispersion which\nis negligible and remains constant no matter how far it\ntravels down the ring. Thus, Bob located at any distant site along the ring can catch almost the entire wavepacket by using a sufficiently long block of spins (\u223c N 1/3 )\nto receive the state. To obtain the the fidelity of quantum communication and entanglement transfer using this\nwave-packet scheme, one simply has to replace f1N in\nthe earlier formulae Eqs.(9) and (12) by the amplitude\nof |G(jA , k)i evolving to |G(jB , k)i with time, where jB\nis the site around which Bob has access to a block of\n\u223c N 1/3 spins. This amplitude can be as 95 percent for\nN up to 5000 [12]. For open ended spin chains, it is not\nideal for Alice to encode |1i in a truncated gaussian wavepacket at one end of the chain, as this will distort and\nspread when it reaches Bob at the other end of the chain.\nThis problem has been cleverly resolved in Ref.[15], which\nshows that Alice can encode a different wave-form on a\nblock of N spins at one end, which evolves to a gaussian wave-packet of certain k0 in the chain and travels\nto the other end with minimal dispersion. Additionally,\nRef.[15] points out how such an encoding in blocks for\nnear perfect communications is possible for any graph of\nspins (albeit, connected with each other through interactions) and how such an encoding/decoding can be accomplished by Alice/Bob with access only to a single spin\n\n\f10\neach, but continuous time control of the interactions of\nthese spins with the graph. Gaussian wave-packet encodings have also been suggested for communication through\nspin-chains in various static external fields [20, 52].\n\nC.\n\nCoupling qubits weakly to a quantum many\nbody system\n\nAnother approach is to couple the sending and receiving qubits weakly to a quantum many body system\n[20, 21, 40, 49]. Say the many body system is an arbitrary graph of spins which interact with each other with\na coupling strength J \u223c 1, while the sending and receiving qubits are coupled to the system through a coupling\n\u01eb where \u01eb << 1. Moreover, assume all the couplings to\nbe of XY or Heisenberg type (other interactions would\nalso do as long as they can enable the transfer of an\nexcitation through the graph from the sending to the\nreceiving qubit). Then, one can derive effective XY or\nHeisenberg Hamiltonians between the two qubits when\nthere are no eigenstates of the many-body system whose\nenergy is close to 0 [20, 40, 49]. This is possible, for example, when the many-body system is in its ground state\nand has a finite energy gap \u2206 between the ground and\nthe first excited state (such as a spin ladder [20]). Effec2\ntively, a Hamiltonian of the form \u01eb2 HXY\nsr or \u01eb Hsr acts\non them, where s and r stand for the sending and the\nreceiving qubits respectively. The effective Hamiltonian\ncan be rigorously derived using second order perturbation theory [20, 40, 49]. This case, which we will call the\n\"off resonant\" case [49], enables a perfect quantum state\ntransfer by the simple fact that the two qubit Hamil2\n2\ntonians \u01eb2 HXY\nsr or \u01eb Hsr do so in a time t \u223c 1/\u01eb . The\nother case is when the many-body system has exactly one\navailable state |\u03bbi of zero energy of the type in which a\nsingle spin is flipped from the ground state, and beyond\nthat, there is a gap \u2206 to all other states of the single flip\ntype. Then a \"resonant\" transfer [49] through the many\nbody system takes place with an effective Hamiltonian\ny\nz\nXY\nx\n\u01ebHXY\nsM + \u01ebHMr , where \u03c3M , \u03c3M and \u03c3M are defined for\nz\na delocalized qubit with \u03c3M = +1 corresponding to the\nz\nmany body system being in |\u03bbi and \u03c3M\n= \u22121 corresponding to the many body system being in its ground\nstate [21, 49]. This resonant effective Hamiltonian is just\na three qubit XY spin chain which can perfectly transfer\nstates in a time scale t \u223c 1/\u01eb [9, 22].\nD.\n\nin conjunction with \"global\" pulses (pulses that act on\neach spin of the chain in exactly the same way) at regular intervals to perfectly transport a state from one of\nits ends to the other [36]. To understand this, we will\nneed two unitary operations, one called the Hadamard\n(denoted by H) which acts on a single qubit to change\n|0i to |+i = |0i + |1i and |1i to |\u2212i = |0i \u2212 |1i and the\nother called the Controlled-Z or simply CZ, which acts\non two qubits to change |1i|\u00b1i to |1i|\u2213i, but keep |0i|\u00b1i\nunchanged [75]. It is shown in Ref.[36] that an Ising chain\nevolving on its own for a time \u03c0/4J followed by fast (instantaneous) operations on the chain by global pulses at\ntime \u03c0/4J (and some extra operations, also fast, at the\nvery ends of the spin chain), accomplishes the operation\nS which is equivalent to a CZ between all adjacent pairs\nof spins followed by a H on each spin. The entire time\nevolution with interruptions by the instantaneous pulses\nat regular intervals is then equivalent to a series of applications of S. Now imagine a N = 4 spin chain to be\ninitialized in the state (\u03b1|0i1 + \u03b2|1i1 )|+i2 |0i3 |+i4 . Then\nsuccessive applications of four S operations accomplishes\nthe evolution\n\nS\n\n(\u03b1|0i1 + \u03b2|1i1 )|+i2 |0i3 |+i4\n\n\u2192 (\u03b1|+i1 |0i2 + \u03b2|\u2212i1 |1i2 )|+i3 |0i4\nS\n\n\u2192 |0i1 (\u03b1|+i2 |0i3 + \u03b2|\u2212i2 |1i3 )|+i4\nS\n\n\u2192 |+i1 |0i2 (\u03b1|+i3 |0i4 + \u03b2|\u2212i3 |1i4 )\nS\n\n\u2192\n\n|0i1 |+i2 |0i3 (\u03b1|+i4 + \u03b2|\u2212i4 ).\n\n(18)\n\nThus an extra H operation on each qubit (accomplishable\nby global pulses) after the above evolution has completely\ntransferred the state at site 1 to site 4. The authors of\nRef.[36] show that in general, for a N spin chain, one\nis able to transfer a quantum state from one end to the\nother by N applications of S (i.e. evolution of the chain\ntill time N \u03c0/4J interrupted by instantaneous pulses at\nregular intervals) and a H on each qubit at the end of the\nevolution. Moreover, they also show that such a transfer\ncan be accomplished by any starting state of the spin\nchain.\nIt should also be mentioned here that some very recent\nworks show that if some degree of slow modulation of the\ncouplings are allowed, then adiabatic passage can also be\nused to transfer quantum states perfectly through a spin\nchain channel [92, 93].\n\nIsing chain with global pulses\nIV.\n\nAnother approach is to use a spin chain Hamiltonian\nwith a different type of coupling, namely a nearest neighbour Ising coupling, as given by\nHIsing =\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nz\nJ\u03c3jz \u03c3j+1\n,\n\n(17)\n\nPERFECTION WITH SIMPLICITY: A\nDUAL-RAIL PROTOCOL\n\nOne always has to pay a \"price\" for perfect transfer.\nThe original protocol with uniform couplings and single\nqubit encoding [6] necessitate mixed state entanglement\ndistillation, and hence several uses of the channel even for\nthe near perfect transmission of a single qubit. The en-\n\n\f11\ngineering of couplings [9, 10, 16, 30] will be naturally restricted to those physical implementations where interaction strengths can be tuned to appropriate values, as opposed to being \"given\", while using wave-packets [12, 15]\nnecessitate involving several qubits for encoding or continuous time control. Weak couplings [20, 21, 40, 49]\nmay give a slower transfer, while global pulse schemes\nspecialize to Ising chains [36]. We now present a protocol introduced in Ref.[18] which does not have to pay any\nof the above prices at the expense of using two spin chains\nin parallel as opposed to a single chain. The couplings\nin the spin chains need not be either uniform or specially engineered and could even be mildly random (with\nthe reasonable assumptions that the chains are similar to\neach other and permit state transfer) [26] and the scheme\ninvolves only two qubits for encoding. We call this a dual\nrail protocol [18, 26].\nAn assumption of control at either end of the spin\nchain, of the spins which Alice and Bob control, is an\nimplicit assumption in all communication protocols using\nspin chains. At the very least, Alice has to \"swap in\" a\nquantum state at one end of the chain (from her quantum\nregister) which requires a tunable interaction of the first\nspin with a register spin. Bob has to have similar ability\nfor retrieving the qubit from the other end of the chain.\nThe same type of interaction, namely a switchable two\nqubit interaction, suffices for the encoding and decoding\nof this scheme involving parallel spin chains. We first\ndescribe below how parallel spin chains can be used for\na \"heralded\" perfect quantum state transmission, where\nconditional on a positive outcome of a measurement, Bob\ncan conclude that he has accurately received the state\ntransmitted to him.\n\nA.\n\nA heralded perfect state transfer\n\nThe idea of Ref.[18] is to use two spin chains I and II\nin parallel as a single communication channel as shown\nin Fig.9. As in previous protocols, this protocol is also\nrestricted to a sector in which each spin chain has at most\none spin flipped in a background of spins in the |0i state.\nWe will thus use a similar notation as before for spin\nchain states, namely |0i(I) and |0i(II) denoting the ferromagnetic ground states (all spins in the |0i state) of the\nchains I and II respectively, and |ji(I) and |ji(II) denoting the jth spin flipped to the |1i state in the chains I and\nII respectively. For the moment, we assume the chains to\nbe non-interacting, identical copies of each other and coupled by uniform Heisenberg or XY interactions as in the\noriginal single chain based protocol [6](some of these assumptions can be relaxed [26], as will be discussed later).\nThe first spin of each chain is controlled by Alice, while\nthe N th spin of each chain is controlled by Bob. Initially,\nthe spin chains are assumed to be in the state |0i(I) and\n|0i(II) . When Alice intends to transmit a qubit state\n|\u03c6i = \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i, she encodes this into the two spins\nthat she controls as |\u03c6\u0303i = \u03b1|01i + \u03b2|10i. This encod-\n\nFIG. 9: The dual rail protocol for perfect quantum communications through spin chain channels. The upper part of the\nfigure shows an arbitrary superposition of the logical qubit\nstates being encoded at one end of the parallel chains (the\ndotted box shows the encoded states of a qubit). The lower\nparts of the figure show two possible states of the chain after\nthe passage of some time and Bob's measurement. Bob's success corresponds to the state being received perfectly on the\nspins at his end of the chain. His failure corresponds to the\ninformation being retained in parts of the chain not accessed\nby Bob, as shown in the lower left hand side of the figure.\nStrictly speaking the state corresponding to failure will be a\nsuperposition of all states of the form shown in the lower left\nhand side i.e., it will be a superposition of all those states in\nwhich the dotted box is at sites other than N .\n\ning can be accomplished by a simple two qubit unitary\noperation (a two qubit quantum gate) [18] involving the\nqubits that Alice controls, and can be accomplished inside the quantum computer. This encoding places the\nentire system of two spin chains in the quantum state\n|\u03a6(0)i = \u03b1|0i(I) |1i(II) + \u03b2|1i(I) |0i(II) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhich evolves with time as\n|\u03a6(t)i =\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nf1j (t)(\u03b1|0i(I) |ji(II) + \u03b2|ji(I) |0i(II) ). (20)\n\nIt is then simple to calculate, by using the method of partial tracing as discussed before, the time varying density\noperator \u033a(t) of the two spins which Bob controls, and is\nfound to be\n\u033a(t) = (1 \u2212 |f1N (t)|2 )|00ih00| + |f1N (t)|2 |\u03c6\u0303ih\u03c6\u0303|.\n\n(21)\n\nBob now measures the \"total\" spin component of his\nspins in the z direction without measuring any of the spins\nindividually. Such a measurement gives a value \u22121 for\n|00i and the value 0 for any superposition of |01i and |10i.\nPhysically, such a measurement can be accomplished by a\ncoarse grained spin measurement on the two spins of Bob\nwhich is insensitive to the precise location of the magnetic moment (a parity measurement on the two spins [?\n], which gives an outcome 0 for |00i and an outcome 1 for\nany superposition of |01i and |10i also suffices). When\n\n\f12\nBob gets the outcome \u22121, which happens with probability (1 \u2212 |f1N (t)|2 ), his spins are projected to the state\n|00i irrespective of the state transmitted. This heralds\nthe failure on Bob's part to receive the state. On the\nother hand, when he obtains the outcome 0, which happens with probability |f1N (t)|2 , his spins are projected\nto the state |\u03c6\u0303i. Bob can now simply apply the inverse\nof the quantum gate that Alice used for encoding to his\nspins to obtain a decoded state |\u03c6i, which corresponds\nto his perfect retrieval the state transmitted by Alice.\nHere we should point out that Bob's actions could also\nbe combined into one two qubit quantum gate followed\nby a single qubit measurement, which the reader will find\nin the original presentation of this protocol [18]. For long\nHeisenberg and XY chains, thus, Bob's success probability in this heralded scheme scales as |f1N (t)|2 \u223c 1/N 2/3\nin a time t \u223c O(N/J). In some sense, we have been able\nto convert the partial fidelity of the transmitted state in\nthe original spin chain communication scheme to a probability of success, and when successful, Bob receives the\ntransmitted state perfectly. It is easy to verify that all the\nabove also holds for transmitting entanglement through\nthe parallel spin chain channel. Thus if Alice and Bob\nwere merely attempting to establish entanglement, then\nAlice could try to send the state of one member of an\nentangled pair of qubits through the channel. If Bob\nfails to receive the state, the channel is reset to the state\n|0i(I) |0i(II) (by cooling to the ground state in a magnetic\nfield, for example) and Alice tries to transmit entanglement again. On average after attempting about N 2/3\ntimes, each of which takes about t \u223c O(N/J) amount of\ntime (so that the total time is O(N 1.67 /J)), Alice and\nBob will be able to share a pure maximally entangled\nstate of two qubits such as |\u03c8 + i.\nB.\n\nUnlimited enhancement of success probability\nby waiting\n\nInterestingly, if one was willing to wait till a time\nO(N 1.67 /J), then even the process of resetting the channel and repeatedly attempting to transmit the state\n(or entanglement, as described above) becomes unnecessary. When Bob fails, the state of the parallel spin\nP \u22121\nchains is N\nf1j (t)(\u03b1|0i(I) |ji(II) +\u03b2|ji(I) |0i(II) ). If we\nPN \u22121\nPNj=1\n\u22121\n(II)\n(I)\nas |\u03c6(t)i(I)\nand\nrelabel\nj=1 f1j |ji\nj=1 f1j |ji\nand |\u03c6(t)i(II) , then this state can be rewritten as\n\u03b1|0i(I) |\u03c6(t)i(II) + \u03b2|\u03c6(t)i(I) |0i(II) , which immediately\nclarifies to the reader that the initial quantum information is unspoilt and simply encoded in a delocalized form\nin the two chains. So can Bob try to retrieve the state\nagain after waiting for a while? The state of the parallel chain system evolves, in another time \u03c4 , to a state of\nP\n(I)\n \u0303\nthe form N\n|ji(II) + \u03b2|ji(I) |0i(II) ), where\nj=1 f1j (\u03b1|0i\nf \u03031j can be simply expressed in terms of fij (t) and fij (\u03c4 )\n[18]. This is just Eq.(20), with f1j (t) replaced by f \u03031j .\nThus, Bob's actions (measurement and decoding) may\n\nagain be repeated at a time \u03c4 after a failure, and again\n \u0303 |2 . In this\nthere is a probability of success equal to |f1N\nway, whenever Bob fails, he simply waits and again attempts to retrieve the state from the chain. In Ref.[18] it\nhas been argued that the total probablity of success on\nrepeated measurements by Bob can be made as high as\n0.99 in a time scale of \u223c O(N 1.67 /J).\nHaving read through the dual rail protocol, the reader\nmay now ask some natural questions. For example, what\nhappens if measurements of the same nature as Bob's\nwere carried out at regular intervals even at other sites\nof the spin chain. Preliminary results indicate that the\nstate transfer may then be significantly speeded up [32].\nAnother interesting question is whether there is any gain\nin going to multiple parallel chains as opposed to two?\nIndeed there is a gain in efficiency. While the dual rail\nprotocol uses two spin chain channels to transmit a single\nqubit, multiple rails can be used to transmit a qubit per\nchain for a large number of rails if the states of multiple\nqubits are suitably encoded on Alice's end of the chain\n[24]. Recently, it has also been shown that even if the\ninstantaneous measurements at fixed instants of time in\nthe dual rail protocol were replaced by more realistic finite strength continuous measurements at the receiving\nend, the performance of the protocol can remain similar\nas long as of the strength of the measurement is appropriately tuned [94].\nC.\n\nInherent robust aspects of the dual rail protocol\n\nThe dual rail protocol is intrinsically robust in many\nways. Suppose Bob has not measured his spins precisely\nat the optimal time, at which his probability of success\nis highest, but slightly before or after that time. The\nprobability will still be quite high (as it is an analytic\nfunction of time), and when successful, Bob will still receive an unspoilt version of the state transmitted by Alice. This contrasts all previous protocols in which the\nfidelity itself of the transmitted state is affected by the\ntime of its reception, and a non-optimal time results in\nthe state being received by Bob being a somewhat corrupted version of the state transmitted by Alice. Another\nimportant robust aspect of the protocol stems from the\nfact the quantum state is transmitted through the parallel chains through what is called a \"decoherence free\"\nencoding. If the parallel chains are not that distant (this\nmay be needed anyway to ensure the possibility of the\nquantum gates or joint measurements at the ends), any\nexternal environment couples to them only through their\nnet magnetic moment in some given direction, such as\n(I)\n(II)\nthrough the operator \u03c3z +\u03c3z . Alice encodes the state\nto be transmitted on her two spins as a superposition of\n(II)\n(I)\nstates |01i and |10i, which are eigenstates of \u03c3z + \u03c3z\nwith eigenvalue 0, and hence decoupled from the environment. The same holds during the transmission, as\nsuperpositions of states |0i(I) |ji(II) and |ji(I) |0i(II) are\nsimilarly decoupled from the environment. This decou-\n\n\f13\npling will enhance the time-scale over which the behavior\nof the parallel chain scheme is unaffected by an external\nenvironment relative to the time scale over which single\nspin chain based communication schemes remain unaffected. The above robustness aspects have been pointed\nout in more detail in Ref.[18], while Ref.[26] points out\nthat the schemes are robust even to a mismatch of the\nchains with each other (the chains do not need to be identical copies of each other). In a nutshell, for mismatched\nrails which are not too dissimilar, there will be a series\nof times at which the absolute values of the amplitudes\n(II)\n(I)\nf1N and f1N for the transmission of a flip from site 1 to\nN through the chains I and II will be coincident. If Bob\nperforms his actions to receive the state at these specific\ntimes, then conditional on success, he will still receive an\nuncorrupted state [26].\n\nV.\n\nSINGLE CHAINS FOR PERFECT\nTRANSFER\n\nIt is possible to obtain some protocols with similar positive attributes as the dual rail protocol which use only\na single spin chain, which we discuss below.\n\nA.\n\nChain of coupled qutrits\n\nFirstly, it is possible to use a single chain of higher\ndimensional quantum systems, such as qutrits (quantum\nthree level systems) with levels |+1i, |0i and |\u22121i, instead\nof two parallel chains [18]. For our protocol, the qutrits\nshould be coupled by the natural generalization of an\nexchange (or isotropic Heisenberg) interaction\nto higher\nP\ndimensions given by a Hamiltonian H = i Pi,i+1 where\nPi,j |\u03c8ii |\u03c6ij = |\u03c6ii |\u03c8ij .\n\n(22)\n\nOne can look up Ref.[43] and references therein for a more\ndetailed discussion of the above Hamiltonian. Please note\ncarefully that in general, the above is not a Hamiltonian\nof a chain of coupled spin-1 systems (except for very special cases), but there are physical systems such as optical\nlattices, where it may be found [95]. For such a Hamiltonian, the state |0i in which each qutrit is in the |0i\nstate, is an eigenstate. From this state, one generates\nthe states |+ji and |\u2212ji of the chain in which the jth\nqutrit is flipped to the | + 1i and | \u2212 1i state respectively.\nThen the dual rail protocol described in the previous section can be exactly adapted to the chain of qutrits with\nthe mappings |0i(I) |0i(II) \u2192 |0i,|0i(I) |ji(II) \u2192 |+ji and\n|ji(I) |0i(II) \u2192 |\u2212ji. One can check that Bob's measurement will now be mapped to a measurement which finds\nout whether his qutrit is in the state |0i or not (without\nascertaining whether the qutrit is in the state | + 1i or\n|\u22121i) and success is when he obtains the result \"not |0i\".\nIn a similar manner, if one had exchange coupled d + 1\nlevel systems, one could use one of those levels as the |0i\n\nstate, and use the others to transmit a d dimensional system perfectly with 0.99 probability of success in a time\n\u223c O(N 1.67 /J) through the chain.\nB.\n\nReceiver with memory\n\nCuriously enough, even a single spin-1/2 chain without\nany encoding from Alice, can transmit a quantum state\nperfectly to Bob if he had a memory at his disposal [44].\nAs in all unencoded single chain protocols describe before, Alice simply places a state \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i on one end\nof a spin chain initialized in the state |0i. The clever\ntrick used for receiving the state with arbitrarily high fidelity is to swap the state of Bob's qubit with that of a\n\"fresh\" memory qubit in state |0i at regular intervals [44].\nThe memory qubits are always non-interacting with each\nother and also non-interacting with the chain apart from\nduring the swaps. Eventually, in a time scale which has\nbeen argued in Ref.[44] to be no larger than O(N 2 /J)\nfor a broad class of chains (not necessarily uniform or\nHeisenberg or XY coupled), the spin chain ends up in\nthe state |0i. In other words, all information about the\ninput state is erased from the chain and transferred entirely to the collection of memory qubits. The unitarity\nof the whole evolution (the spin chain dynamics and the\nseries of unitary swap operations) then guarantees that\nthe collective state of all memory qubits is a function\nof \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i. The same unitarity also guarantees that\nBob can use another unitary operation to convert the\nstate from a multiple qubit memory state to the single\nqubit state \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i, thereby completing the reception\nof the state transmitted by Alice. Ref.[44] also shows that\nAlice can transmit many qubits simultaneously through\nthe chain using the above protocol. Very recently there\nhas been another interesting proposal in which Bob need\npossess only one memory qubit to receive a single qubit\ntransmitted by Alice [59]. Bob lets this memory qubit\ninteract with the spin at his end of the chain at regular\nintervals, but for different durations of time during each\ninteraction. These times durations are so chosen that\nthe entire amplitude of Bob's spin to be in the |1i state\nis transferred to the memory qubit (the reader may check\nRef.[59] to satisfy him/herself that this is indeed possible\nthrough an unitary operation). In this way, as before, the\nchain will finally be left in the state |0i (all information\nerased), and the memory qubit will end up in the state\n\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i. One positive feature of this scheme is that\nthe memory qubit may itself be a part of the spin chain,\nsay an extra N +1th spin attached to the N th spin of the\nchain, with its interaction with the chain being switchable through a local magnetic field [59].\n\nVI.\n\nPHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS\n\nThere has been several suggestions for the physical implementations of the quantum communication schemes\n\n\f14\ndescribed in this review. Essentially, chains of any physical system which has been proposed as a qubit, and\nwhich can be coupled with each other through an appropriate interaction (such as Heisenberg or XY), can be\nused. However, a permanent (non-tunable) coupling between the qubits will suffice. The most prominent class\nof suggestions are based on chains of superconducting\nqubits [25, 42, 51]. One such example is based on charge\nqubits [25], where the two states of the qubit are the presence or absence of a Cooper pair in a superconducting island. A Cooper pair can hop from one island to its neighbour through a Josephson coupling, which acts as an XY\nterm in the Hamiltonian. There are additional parts to\nthis Hamiltonian, such as a long range (much more than\nnearest neighbour) Coulomb interaction, which cannot\nbe ignored [25]. Alternatively, one can use two opposite\nflux states of superconducting rings as the two states of a\nqubit, while these rings are coupled to each other through\ncapacitive couplings [42, 51]. Implementations of slightly\ndifferent schemes for entanglement distribution have also\nbeen discussed for Josephson junction arrays [100].\nFrom the point of view of simulations with short\nchains, NMR is well suited (the ability to simulate communications through a 6 spin Heisenberg ring using benzene was already suggested in Ref.[6]). Recently, quantum communication through a 3-qubit Ising chain using\nglobal pulses (the scheme of Ref.[36]) was demonstrated\nusing NMR [101]. In quantum dots, which are tunnel\ncoupled, so that electrons can freely hop from one dot to\nanother, the electronic spin may be used as a qubit, and\nits transport in an array has been studied in a scheme\nslightly different from the ones discussed in this review\n[10]. Alternatively, excitons (coupled electron and hole\npairs) in quantum dots may be used for implementing the\nschemes described in this review [96] (and other communication schemes as well [97]), with the two states of the\nqubit being the presence or absence of an exciton in a\nquantum dot, and an XY coupling between neighbouring\ndots being provided by the F\u00f6rster interaction. There\nhave also been various suggestions for implementations\nof the dynamics of XY chains in other systems, such as\nan array of low loss cavities for holding light coupled to\neach other so that photons can freely hop between them.\nWhen the light in each cavity is coupled to a single twolevel system, then the system simulates a XY model [98],\nand consequently, the schemes described here can also be\nimplemented in such arrays. Another example is the simulation with chains of atoms trapped in optical lattices\n[99], which should again be an avenue for implementation.\n\nVII.\n\nDEVELOPING AND FUTURE\nDIRECTIONS\n\nWe would like to end the review by briefly pointing\nout the varied directions in which the topic is expanding as these offer the scope of much future work. One\n\nof the most obvious questions is what apart from quantum communications can be accomplished in the same\nspirit? By the \"same spirit\" we mean through the natural\ntime evolution of a complex many body system. Starting\nfrom the most modest of aims, one can use a small ring\nof permanently coupled spins with a flux in the middle\nto design a quantum router [23]. In such a router the\ncommunication can be directed between any chosen pair\nof users from a multitude of users by adjusting the flux\n(an implicit assumption here is that it applies to those\nspin systems which involve charged entities at some level,\nso that a flux \"twists\" the boundary conditions of the\nring). Routers have also been proposed in the context\nof weakly coupled sending/receiving qubit schemes [49].\nPermanently coupled rings of spins can serve as quantum memories [102], and a time varying flux through\nsuch rings can undo the natural dispersion of quantum\ninformation stored in individual spins in such a system\n[103] (in general, spin rings with a flux is itself emerging\nas quite a fruitful system for varied quantum information\napplications [23, 103, 104, 105]). Networks of perpetually\ncoupled spins can also serve as a quantum cloning machine, were information initially placed on N of the spins\nis cloned to M of the spins due to the natural dynamical evolution of the network [106, 107, 108]. Simple spin\nnetworks can also be automata for single spin measurement [53], while certain other desirable automata have\nbeen shown to be impossible [109]. What other dedicated\nsmall scale applications can we find for small (possibly\nengineered) networks of spins can thus be an interesting\nfuture goal.\nOf course a more ambitious goal is to achieve fullscale quantum computation using permanently coupled\nsystems such as spin chains. Indeed, it was noticed\nquite early (even predating the suggestion of spin chains\nfor quantum communications) that the free evolution of\nsmall segments of 3 \u2212 5 Heisenberg/XY interacting spins\ncan give rise to quantum gates between qubits encoded in\nthese segments [11, 110], which was exploited for designing a universal quantum computer with spin chains [110].\nRecently, natural evolutions of designer spin networks for\nquantum gates where qubits are fed in from one end of\nthe system and read out from the other end of the system\nafter gates have acted on them, have been proposed [105].\nInterestingly, the free evolution of engineered spin chains\ncan enact interesting multi-qubit quantum gates because\nof the exchange of fermionic operators to which such systems can be mapped [22, 111, 112]. Particularly, such\nspin chains can be used as a processor core for a quantum computer on to which states of qubits are loaded\nfor running certain important classes of algorithms [112].\nWhether one can find a general purpose processor core or\nwhether a single permanently coupled network can be designed for running an entire quantum algorithm involving\nseveral gates, are interesting open questions.\nSpin chains need not act merely as passive buses for\nquantum information, they can also act as sources of\nentanglement when put in an appropriate initial state.\n\n\f15\nWhat we really want is a state which dynamically evolves\nin time and generates significant entanglement between\nthe remotest parts of a spin chain. Probably the simplest\nexample is flipping the spin at the middle of a ferromagnetic spin chain, and letting the state evolve, which can\nentangle the spins at the opposite ends of the chain [22].\nSuch studies have been conducted from very early on\nin the context of harmonic oscillator chains [13, 14] and\nalso in context of graphs of qutrits [43] and oscillators\n[46], and more recently, also for graphs of spins [113] (see\nalso Ref.[114] for entanglement from dynamics). However, this area, which one can call \"quantum wires for\nentanglement generation and distribution\", is open for\nfuture work as the possibilities of initial states of spin\nchains are enormous.\nAnother area offering possibilities for further exploration is when the spin chains, instead of being completely unmodulated, are subjected to a time varying external field. Pulsing the whole chain is an example, which\nis still a minimal procedure in comparison to switching\nindividual interactions on and off. We have already encountered the fact that regular pulsing in an Ising chain\ncan lead to perfect state transfer [36]. The same chain on\nappropriate pulsing can also accomplish universal quantum computation [36] (see also the work in Ref.[115]).\nFor Heisenberg chains, pulsing with a field of an appropriate profile after flipping the spin at the middle of a\nferromagnetic spin chain, gives rise to oppositely propagating entangled gaussian wave-packets, which would be\nvery useful for the distribution of entanglement [56]. Applying external fields to dimerized spin chains can also\nenable encoding qubits in domain walls and by varying\nthe profile of this field, such qubits can be transported\n[116]. It remains an open question as to what else can\nbe accomplished by time varying external fields on spin\nchains. This question is particularly interesting because\nmodulating a few external parameters can control how\ncorrelations propagate in spin chains [119], and the implications of that for quantum communications is worthwhile to examine.\nAnother open area is related to the issue of quantum\nresponse of a physical system to a quantum impulse as\nmentioned in the introduction. Quantum communication\nthrough a spin chain is one example of this, with the fidelity of transmission being a kind of response function.\nIn this context, Ref.[62] finds, for the scenario where\nAlice's and Bob's qubits are weakly coupled to a spin\nsystem, that quantum phase transitions of the spin system can be detected by a drop in this response function.\nWhen Alice's and Bob's spins are coupled as strongly\nto the spin system as the spins in the system are coupled to each other, then Ref.[63] reports the opposite behaviour, namely that the same response function peaks\nat some quantum phase transitions. Ref.[63] is also an\nexample of proceeding to higher spins in the context of\nquantum communication using spin chains. This is also\n\nan interesting direction. It has been shown, for example, that chains of higher dimensional systems coupled\nthrough the permutation Hamiltonian of subsection V A\ncan be used to distribute much more entanglement than\npossible through a spin-1/2 chain [122]. Another example is a lattice system in which a large number of bosons\ncan sit at each site, which has been shown to be able to\ndistribute more and more entanglement as the number\nof bosons is increased [121]. Whether generically chains\nof higher spin systems provides a better quantum communication bus in comparison to low spin systems is an\ninteresting open question.\nSome directions of investigation are important for realistic physical implementations. For example, what happens when spins interact through long range dipolar interactions? Then it has been found that state transfer\nprocess in an uniformly coupled chain reaches near unit\nfidelity at the expense of a time which scales as N 3 /J\n[57]. Effect of randomness [50, 58] and defects [123] on\nthe quality of quantum information transmission has also\nbeen studied, as well thermal effects [28]. Of course, a\nquestion of central importance is what happens if the\nspins of the chain are not isolated, but coupled to their\nenvironment, as such a coupling might be unavoidable\nin certain physical implementations. When each spin of\nan exchange coupled system is coupled to its own independent bath of polarized spins through a XY coupling,\nthen, it has been shown that the fidelity of communication is unaffected [61]. Only the time of communication is\ndelayed and the fidelity undergoes rapid oscillations with\ntime [61]. Effects of other kinds of baths on spin chain\nquantum communications have also been recently analyzed [55, 120]. No doubt the investigations of the above\nkinds of issues which will automatically arise in the context of practical implementations, will form a major part\nof future research on quantum communications through\nspin chain dynamics.\n\nVIII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would like to particularly thank Daniel Burgarth,\nthe chief architect of the dual rail protocol, and my collaborator in many of the papers covered here.
