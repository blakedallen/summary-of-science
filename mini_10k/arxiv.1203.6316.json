Introduction\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [1] are wireless\nnetworks whose primary task is information gathering\nby monitoring parameters of the environment. They\nconsist of a number of sensor nodes each gathering information and reporting it back to their sink. The observed parameters can take a variety of forms, such as\ntemperature, humidity, pollution, traffic, volcano and\nearthquake activities, structural deficiencies, bird flight\npath patterns or even enemy movements on battlefields. Due to this rich and dynamic field of applications WSNs have become an active research field in\nthe area of wireless communications.\n* Corresponding\n\nauthor. E-mail: boris.bellalta@upf.edu\n\nThe main research focus for WSNs is on creating\nsmarter, cheaper and more intelligent sensors, as well\nas more energy efficient networks. But even although\nthere has been tremendous progress, there remain numerous unsolved issues. Moreover, due to their varying application scenarios, individual sensor networks\ndiffer from each other, e.g, in terms of their individual protocol stack or network functionality. This is partially due to the fact that different vendors are manufacturing different kinds of sensor network nodes, so\nevery sensor network has its own MAC, routing and\ntransport protocols. Due to this heterogeneity, sensor\nnetworks are typically considered as individual entities\nbeing logically separated from each other.\nAs a result, research on WSNs focuses more on\ninternal issues of single networks, such as routing,\nenergy management or MAC protocol development.\n\n1876-1364/0-1900/$17.00 c 0 \u2013 IOS Press and the authors.

Interconnected Heterogeneous Sensor Networks via Collaborative Information Sharing\n\nExtensive work has already been done in those areas, and development continues. However, the interaction between multiple heterogeneous spatially distributed sensor networks is an issue that has not received much attention. Therefore, sharing information\nbetween multiple sensor networks, inter WSN communication, and connecting multiple sensor networks via\na feasible architecture have been started to be investigated recently.\nIn this work, we describe a novel approach to utilize\nan inter-WSN communication architecture to optimize\nthe performance of individual WSNs. It can therefore\nbe seen as a complementary work to all performance\noptimizations focused on single networks without any\nadditional information, e.g., MAC or routing protocols, or cross layer optimizations for the sensor network protocol stack. In our approach, we consider the\nheterogeneous nature of different types of sensor networks and do not try to generate a global, centrally\ncontrolled optimization strategy. We believe it is neither feasible nor practical to propose a common MAC\nor routing protocol for every sensor network, or to have\na common cross layer optimization method for the entire architecture to optimize the performance.\nInstead, we propose that individual sensor networks\nimprove their performance by utilizing reports from\nother sensor networks, taking into account all relevant\ninformation to take the best decision locally. To this\nend, we propose both a global architecture that allows\nto find and establish contact with these additional information sources, as well as a method how to use this\ninformation to reduce energy consumption and to increase the sensing quality of individual networks. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this approach of using reported information from other WSNs to optimize local\nperformance has not been considered before.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nSection 2 describes the basic idea and model for improving the performance of a WSN using external information. Section 3 provides the description of our\nproposed architecture, while Section 4 contains realistic use cases for our architecture. Section 5 gives the\nan overview on the related work, and finally Section 6\nsummarizes our conclusions and provides an outlook\non our future work.\n\n2. Benefits of Collaboration\nIn this section we describe how we aim to improve\nenergy consumption and sensing quality by sharing in-\n\nformation between WSNs. To this end, we develop a\nbasic model, and then apply it to both of these performance indices.\nWe consider a set of sensor networks, consisting of\nWSN A (S A ) up to WSN N (S N ), with each of these\nnetworks consisting of a different number of sensor\nnodes. If we define every individual\nnetwork S I\n\b I Isensor\nI\nI\nas its set of sensors S = S1 , S2 , S3 , S4I , ....SnI I ,\nwhich has cardinality nI , we can express those individual sensor network sets as\nSA =\n\n\b\n\nS1A , S2A , S3A , S4A , .....SnAa\n\nSB =\n\n\b\n\nS1B , S2B , S3B , S4B , .....SnBb\n\n\b\n\nS1N , S2N , S3N , S4N , .....SnNN\n\n...\nS\n\nN\n\n=\n\nWe will now first consider the case of WSN S I in\na standard, non-cooperative case, i.e., S I operates autonomously without any additional information. We\nmodel the operation of this network in terms of the\nmessages sent and received by the sink of S I . We consider that the sink updates the configuration of the sensors SkI by sending query messages at time instances\ntk , cf. Figure 1.a). Among other things, these queries\nconfigure the time interval t\u03b1 between two consecutive\nreports sent by the sensors to the sink. As well, it conI\nfigures the number of active nodes |Sactive\n| in S I , i.e.,\nI\nthe subset of S which will report its values.\nI\nWe can assume t\u03b1 and |Sactive\n| to remain constant\nbetween two consecutive sink queries at tx and tx+1 .\nDepending on the WSN, this value may even never be\nchanged over the lifetime of the network. In any case,\nS I can in the best case only take into account its own\nI\nmeasured information to modify t\u03b1 and |Sactive\n| over\ntime.\nIn our cooperative scenario, however, we assume\nthat more information is available, coming from other\nWSNs, e.g., S J . This additional information will allow\nto judge better the necessity for frequent reports and\nthe number of active sensors. For example, if S J reports an incident, S I can decrease t\u03b1 . In contrast, if S J\nreports uncritical values, S I may decrease its level of\noperation as well by increasing t\u03b1 and only requesting\nI\nreports from a lower number |Sactive\n| of its sensors.\nThus, the situation shown in Figure 1.a) changes. S I\nmay now additionally update the reporting interval every time it receives information from S J , cf. Figure\n\n\f3\n\nS. Pal, et al., / Perf. Opt. of Mult.

Non-cooperative and cooperative scenario. In the cooperative scenario, the queries are used to change the operation of the WSNs to adapt\nto environment based on the information received from other WSNs.\n\n1.b). Using a decision making process described in the\nnext section, it can take into account its own measured\ninformation plus the information from S J . If this process returns a changed t\u03b1 , the sink of S I will issue an\nadditional query to its sensors.\nIn general, we imagine that sensor nodes from both\nS I and S J will sense information and forward them\ntowards their respective sinks. The sinks will then\nforward this information towards interested recipient\nWSNs, using the architecture described in the next section. However, if no information from other networks\nis received, the individual WSNs can still operate as in\nthe non-cooperative scenario.\nThe information exchange will be useful when the\nexchanging WSNs sense the same parameter in the\nsame area. However, the more interesting case is when\nS I and S J sense different parameters that are tightly\ncorrelated in nature, e.g., the traffic and pollution levels in the same city. Then, information about one parameter, e.g., traffic, can be used to predict the level of\nthe other, e.g., pollution, to a certain degree.\nOur basic assumption is that a sensor network is not\ninterested in measuring all levels of its sensed parameter with equal interest. Instead, extreme or critical values have a much higher impact than 'normal' levels,\nand are therefore of more interest. As an example, high\nlevels of pollution should be sensed with a higher accuracy than low levels or a level of 0, due to their health\n\nimplications. Similarly, it is more critical to have more\nexact information about the location and spread of a\nforest fire when it occurs, than measuring with a high\nlevel of accuracy that there is no forest fire. As we\nwill describe in the following, being able to predict the\nlevel of the sensed value should allow for a better resource usage in the affected WSN.\n2.1. Energy Consumption\nSince every sent and routed information update containing measured values consumes an amount of energy of the sensor nodes, we see that the energy consumption of the sensor network depends on t\u03b1 and\nI\n|Sactive\n|. For longer values of t\u03b1 , less energy is consumed over a longer timespan, for shorter values of\nt\u03b1 , more energy is consumed. Similarly, if the sink reI\nquests that a lower number of sensors |Sactive\n| in its\nnetwork reports values, less energy will be consumed\nwithin the complete network, extending its lifetime.\nTherefore, if S I receives information from S J and\ndecides, based on this information, that it can reduce its level of operation (increase t\u03b1 and decrease\nI\n|Sactive\n|), it can reduce its energy consumption during\nthat period. When a higher level of operation is necessary afterwards, e.g., because S J or its own sensors reI\nport an important event, S I can increase |Sactive\n| and\ndecrease t\u03b1 again. Thereby, S I can adapt its energy\n\n\f4\n\nS. Pal, et al., / Perf. Opt. of Mult.

System Architecture\n\nconsumption better to the current situation in the real\nworld.\n2.2. Sensing Quality\nSimilarly, S I can adapt at the same time its sensing\nquality (Q). Sensing quality can be defined as the relation between the actual update frequency of sensors\nI\n\u03bb = t1\u03b1 and their number |Sactive\n| on the one hand,\n\u2217\nI\nand the ideal frequency \u03bb and number |Sactive\n|\u2217 on\nthe other. A simple approach for the sensing quality\nwould therefore be\n\u03bb |S I\n|\nQ = min 1, \u2217 Iactive \u2217\n\u03bb |Sactive |\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n(1)\n\nwhere the maximum achievable quality is Q = 1.\nI\nThe values of \u03bb\u2217 and |Sactive\n|\u2217 depend on the current circumstances in the real world. For example, under critical circumstances (extremely high levels of\ntraffic or temperature, an earthquake or forest fire happening), these values can be expected to be higher than\nunder non-critical circumstances. Generally, the more\nsensor nodes send their sensed information to their\nsink, and the higher the frequency of these updates is,\nup to the ideal values, the better will be the sensing\nquality. However, this has to be paid for in terms of energy consumption. In our approach, we want therefore\n\nto improve on the utilization of this trade-off utilizing\nthe information from additional networks.\nNote that from Equation 1, it is clear that \u03bb and\nI\nI\n|Sactive\n| should be always equal to \u03bb\u2217 and |Sactive\n|\u2217\n\u2217\nI\n\u2217\nto get Q = 1. Then, if \u03bb and |Sactive | change with\nI\ntime, \u03bb and |Sactive\n| should also be adapted to those\nchanges. Higher values than the optimal only result in\na higher energy consumption, but not in a higher quality.\n\n3. Architecture Description\nIn this section, we will describe the components and\nalgorithms of our architecture. These additional building blocks enable the information exchange between\nWSNs and the usage of this information to improve the\nperformance of individual WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect multiple sensor networks,\nwe are introducing a new entity called Enhanced Gateways (EG) in each sensor network, as shown in Figure 2. Each EG has a direct connectivity to the sink of\nits sensor network, and additionally is connected to the\nInternet.\nIn some previous works this kind of entity has been\nshown only as Gateways, with the sole purpose of providing a bridge between the sensor networks and the IP\nnetwork. In our scenario, this entity offers more than\ngateway functionality, as we will describe in the fol-\n\n\fS. Pal, et al., / Perf. Opt. of Mult.

Enhanced Gateway\nThe Enhanced Gateways are the main new architectural component that our approach adds to WSNs.\nThey are well-dimensioned machines having a reliable\nInternet connection, and are directly connected to their\nrespective sensor network sink, i.e., there is one EG\nper sensor network. The set of all EGs maintains an\noverlay between themselves, as described in Section\n3.2. This overlay is used to establish communication\nbetween pairs of EGs, of which at least one can benefit\nfrom information exchange.\nThese pairs of EGs will exchange aggregated information from their attached sensor networks in the form\nof regular updates. Currently, we envision this to be an\naverage of the sensed values, but it might also be the\ncomplete set of measurements from all sensors in the\nnetwork. The receipt of such an update by an EG leads\nto an evaluation of all available information, and possibly a reconfiguration of the attached sensor network,\nas described in Section 2. Moreover, in some specific\nscenarios these updates may also trigger a forwarding\ntowards other concerned entities, e.g., emergency services.\n\nIn our architecture, we propose to evaluate received\ninformation based on the flow chart shown in Figure\n3. Whenever a new update from a remote sensor network or the local sensors is received, the EG Reasoning Module considers this new information along\nwith the latest values stored for all other information\nsources. Based on the trust value of all these sources,\ncf. Section 3.4, and on the currency of their information, it will calculate a new level of operation, i.e.,\nI\nt\u03b1 and Sactive\n. If the values of these parameters have\nchanged in comparison to the current sensor network\nconfiguration, the EG will instruct its attached sink to\ngenerate a new query with the updated parameters and\nsend it to the sensors.\nThe calculation of the level of operation should,\ne.g., take into account if the local sensor network measured highly variable or extreme values, and whether\nreported values for correlated parameters indicate a\nchange in the measured value soon. To illustrate this,\nwe will give in Table 1 some example rules that we\nwill use in a straightforward rule-based approach for\nthis algorithm for measured values of pollution (P )\nand traffic (T ).\n3.2.

P2P overlay Network\n\nson for selecting a single hop overlay is that we want\nto keep the lookup time to locate other corresponding\nEGs as low as possible. As in our scenario the nodes\nare stable and not changing their locations, the churn\nrate will be low, making the use of such an overlay\nfeasible.\nIn a one-hop DHT, every EG will hold some state\nabout every other EG. This state is contained in a\nGlobal Lookup Table (GLT), which will hold a small\nnumber of values for each EG and their sensor network. These values are the overlay node identifier, the\nIP address of the corresponding enhanced gateway, the\nGPS coordinates of the centre of the sensor network,\nand finally the network category, identifying what kind\nof information the sensor network is collecting. Thus,\nthe GLT looks like shown in Table 2.\nAn EG wishing to join the overlay generates an attach request message and sends it to an already participating node, which will respond with its GLT. The\naddress of a participating node can be obtained using\na globally available information source, such as a web\nservice. As well, this step may include a registration or\nauthentication process.\n\n3.3. Cooperating Networks\nWhile the GLT means that an EG knows about the\nexistence of all other sensor networks willing to exchange information, it is neither feasible nor necessary\nto actually establish a cooperation with all of them.\nOnly sensor networks that are roughly in the same\narea in the physical space, and that gather information\nabout related parameters are of interest for communication. Therefore, a second list of EGs needs to be derived from the GLT, containing the sensor networks\nwith which the local EG wants to share information.\nWe will call this secondary list Cooperating Networks\nTable (CNT).\nThe formation of this secondary table is based on the\naim that it should consist of only those networks who\nwill qualify for cooperation. As a simple algorithm to\nimplement this functionality, we propose to use the\nphysical proximity between sensor networks, as discussed in Section 3.3.1. Apart from this distance calculation, every EG also should make its selection based\non the network category column of the GLT, which allows to filter for sensor networks measuring a related\nparameter.\n\n\fS.

Thus, we propose\nto assign a trust level to each of these networks, reflecting the value of the provided information to the\nlocal performance optimization. A first approximation\nof this trust can be made based upon the distances between the networks, as we describe in Section 3.4. In\nSection 3.4.1, we will describe another, experiencebased method to fine-tune the trust level.\nThis value, along with the currency of received information, should be taken into account when making\ndecisions based on information coming from other networks, cf. Section 3.1. Thus, the CNT has the form\nseen in Table 3. The time interval signifies how frequently updates are received from the other sensor network, while latest value holds the last reported information. Finally, the CNT holds the timestamp at which\nthe last update containing that information arrived.\n3.3.1. Calculating Sensor Network Distances\nIn this section, we will explain how to calculate the\ndistance between two sensor networks, as this value is\nused to form the CNT.\nWe consider (xI , yI ) as the geographical location\ncoordinates for sensor network S I . Typically, we assume these coordinates to be the geographical center\nof the sensor network. It is one of our assumptions\nthat while deploying the sensor network, the concerned\nperson will note these location coordinates.\nSince these locations are part of the GLT, the local EG forming its CNT can calculate the distance\nbetween its own sensor network center and the coordinates of all other sensor networks. This distance\ncalculation between two GPS coordinates can be per-\n\n....\n....\n....\nN 37 \u25e6 58' 44.8932\",\nE 23 \u25e6 42' 59.688\"\n\nHumidity\nTraffic\n....\n....\n....\n....\nPollution\n\nformed using the Haversine distance calculation formula shown in Equation 2, where d is the distance between 2 geographical location coordinates, R is the\nmean radius of Earth (i.e. 6371 km), 4lat is the difference between lat2 and lat1 and 4long is the difference between long2 and long1. lat1 (long1) is the latitude (longitude) of the network computing d and lat2\n(long2) is the latitude (longitude) of the other network.\nUsing these distances, one for every sensor network\nparticipating in the global architecture, the local EG\ncan now filter out all networks that are farther away\nthan a threshold dImax . This threshold can depend on\nthe type of the local sensor network and is therefore\nnot a globally fixed value. Only networks closer than\nthis maximum distance are considered for inclusion in\nthe CNT. In addition, their category must match, as described in the following section.\n3.3.2. Matching Network Category\nAfter calculating the distance, the EG evaluates the\nnetwork category of the remaining networks. This\nvalue will show what parameters those networks are\nsensing. Every EG should know with what other kind\nof network it can collaborate with, e.g., by pre-defining\nit in the EGs' software. If the category of the remote\nsensor network matches, it can be included in the CNT.\n3.4. Level of Trust\nAs described, with the trust value we aim to give\nan EG the option to differentiate between information\nsources, and to weigh their input. Any EG that is part\nof the CNT has a base trust value, since information\nfrom this entity is accepted. However, EGs should be\ntrusted more the more is known about them and the\nquality of their information.\n\n\f8\n\nS. Pal, et al., / Perf. Opt. of Mult.

This allows us to linearly scale\nthe trust value between a maximum initial value, e.g.,\n10, for having the exact same coordinates, and a value\nof 0 for a distance of dImax .\nIf, additionally, the coordinates of the individual\nsensors of the two networks are available as well, a\nmore fine-grained distance could be computed, with an\naccording higher trust value if this calculation shows a\ngood match between the two networks.\nFinally, we can increase the trust value of remote\nnetworks by keeping track of their reports and how\nwell they correlate with the measured values in the local sensor network, as described in the following.\n3.4.1. Correlation Coefficient of Measured\nInformation\nAs described, the EG of a sensor network S I will\nregularly receive reports from each cooperating EG,\ne.g., S J . We define the contained reported value of the\nreport number y as vyJ . EGI can also note the current value reported by the local sensor network, vyI ,\nand thus create a pair of values for each received report. Over time, it thus can create a combined history\nof externally and internally collected information, i.e.,\nv I and v J .\nOnce enough values are collected, EGI can calculate the correlation coefficient function rvI vJ using\nEquation 3, where n is the length of the recorded history.\nThe trust value can then be increased if a strong positive or negative correlation is seen, i.e., by common\ndefinition for |rvI vJ | > 0.7. Whether we see a positive\nor negative correlation depends on the scenario, i.e.,\n\n(2)\n\ntraffic levels and pollution should generally be positively correlated, while humidity and forest fire probability should be negatively correlated.\nIn this experience-based approach, rvI vJ can be updated over time. Thus, an EG can react to changes in\nsensor deployments, better coverage, etc. Remote EGs\nthat report more and more useful information will thus\nbe able to 'earn' more trust, and their reports will then\nhave a higher weight in the local decision making process.\n4. Use Case Descriptions\nIn this section, we will briefly describe two scenarios where we believe our approach could be beneficial. However, these examples are merely illustrative and not exhaustive, since our approach works for\nany combination of sensed information that is correlated in nature, such as humidity and rainfall, temperature and agricultural growth monitoring, or earthquakes and structural monitoring.\n4.1. Traffic & Pollution\nTraffic and pollution are two basic areas where we\ncan find wide spread usage of sensor networks in\nmetropolitan cities around the world. Traffic Sensors\nare normally widely deployed for traffic management\nand monitoring by the civil authorities. These sensors\ncan measure vehicle quantities passing by during a\nfixed period of time, and in addition they may monitor\nvehicle classes and velocity. This scenario is depicted\nin Figure 5.\nPollution sensors, on the other hand, are used especially in large cities to keep track of the smog gener-\n\n\fS. Pal, et al., / Perf. Opt. of Mult.

Traffic & Pollution Scenario\n\nated there by the high concentration of industry and\ntraffic. Since especially the day-to-day air pollution\nhas health implications, data from these sensor networks can be used to warn citizens with a form of pollution scale, or traffic may be managed differently to\nreduce the amount of cars in the city.\nSince a significant part of the air pollution in large\ncities is caused by traffic, we envision that a cooperation between these types of sensor networks could be\nbeneficial. Since the level of traffic typically does not\ndepend on the level of pollution, there will be mainly\nan information flow from the traffic sensor network\nEGs to the pollution sensor network EGs. Each update\ncontains the currently measured traffic levels. The EG\nof the receiving pollution sensor network will therefore receive information about rising traffic levels, and\ncan then increase the level of operations of its network\naccordingly to better sense an upcoming peak in pollution. On the other hand, if low levels of traffic are reported, and if the pollution sensor themselves show no\ncritical values, the EG might decide to increase t\u03b1 and\nI\ndecrease |Sactive\n|.\n\n4.2. Temperature, Wind speed, Humidity & Forest\nFire Probability\nThe previous scenario illustrates an example for one\ntype of sensor network using data of a second type.\nHowever, our architecture allows a more general cooperation, i.e., the collection and utilization of data from\na number of sources of different kinds. An example\nfor this is a forest fire detection sensor network, as depicted in Figure 6.\nGeographical information datasets have shown that\nthe probability for forest fires is directly proportional\nto specific environmental conditions, such as very high\ntemperature, extremely low relative humidity and very\nhigh wind-speed [15]. As an example we can take the\nBlack Saturday Bush Fire of 2009 in Australia. According to records, this incident was made possible by\nthe presence of all of the above mentioned favorable\nconditions. Temperatures reached 46.4 degrees Celsius, while humidity levels as low as 6% were reported,\nand wind speeds of 100 km/h were measured [14]. All\nthree of these metrics can be and are monitored by sensor networks, e.g., for meteorological purposes.\nThus, we believe the information gathered by these\ntypes of sensor networks can be used to adapt the level\n\n\f10\n\nS.

Temperature, Wind speed, Humidity & Forest Fire Probability\n\nof operation of a forest fire detection sensor network.\nIn periods with low temperatures and high humidity,\nthe level of operation of the detection network can be\ndecreased because the probability for a fire is very low.\nOn the other hand, if high temperatures and a low humidity are reported in the general area for a longer period, and if in addition high wind speeds are measured,\nthen the EG should let more sensors report in shorter\nintervals to be able to detect a fire quickly in this critical situation.\n\n5. Other Initiatives\nAs we have mentioned, traditionally research in\nWSNs has been focused on internal issues like routing,\nself organization, new MAC or routing protocol development, and energy consumption. Due to the numerous approaches in these fields, WSNs show a heterogeneous usage of protocols and mechanisms. Integrating\n\nthese heterogeneous networks with the IP world has\nbecome a new research direction recently. In this field,\nsome work has been done regarding architectures for\ninterconnecting WSNs.\nTo interconnect multiple spatially distributed heterogeneous sensor networks, two basic approaches\nexist, namely a client/server-based approach and a\nP2P approach. As in other application fields, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, i.e.,\nthe more centralized system offers a higher level of\ncontrol, but at the price of introducing a central point\nof failure and scalability issues. Due to the fact that our\napproach belongs to the class of P2P architectures, we\nwill primarily discuss these systems.\nIrisNet [2] was one of the first large scale overlaybased architectures. It was primarily meant to interconnect various multimedia sensors which are distributed\nworld-wide and which are capable of running rich application suites. Sharing infrastructure resources is the\n\n\fS. Pal, et al., / Perf. Opt. of Mult. Interconnected Heterogeneous Sensor Networks via Collaborative Information Sharing\n\n11\n\nmost important design principle of the IrisNet architecture.\nHourglass [3] is an Internet-based software architecture to connect various sensor networks, their services\nand applications. Hourglass consists of an overlay network of dedicated connected machines which provides\nservice registration, node discovery and routing of data\nfrom sensors to clients application.\nSharedSense [4] is mainly a peer to peer environment for connecting multiple heterogeneous sensor\nnetworks and monitoring them. It is based upon JXTA\n[5], which is a Java based P2P substrate, having a different set of rules and regulations in comparison to\nother popular P2P overlays [6].\nThe authors of [7] proposed a mobile P2P sensor\nnetworks overlay which was based upon 3G mobile\nnetworks. This overlay was also based upon JXTA.\nP2PBridge [8,9] was another initiative with the idea to\nhave an inter WSN-communication and interoperability. Again, JXTA is used as the P2P substrate.\nThe MetroSense Project [10] is a general purpose\nheterogeneous architecture based on people-centric\nsensing applications. GSN [11], or the Global Sensor Network platform is a flexible middleware approach which was envisioned to provide a common\nplatform to connect multiple widely deployed sensor\nnetworks and create a global Sensor Internet. GSWSN\n[12], or Global Scale Wireless Sensor Networks is another Internet-based overlay architecture to interconnect globally dispersed heterogeneous wireless sensor\nnetworks. Finally, in [13], a hierarchically structured\nworldwide sensor web architecture has been proposed\nto retrieve data from multiple heterogeneous sensor\nnetworks.\nAll these architectures, and comparable serverbased approaches, have in common that they interconnect different and heterogeneous sensor networks. However, the functionality of these architectures mainly consists in enabling a global management and data evaluation. Information is generally envisioned to flow from sensor networks towards users or\nexternal systems. In contrast, our architecture has the\nprimary goal of enabling communication and cooperation between the sensor networks themselves, with the\nspecific goal of performance optimization for individual WSNs.\n\ntion received from other sensor networks, opening new\nresearch directions in both the WSN and Networking\ncommunity. We described the internal WSN mechanisms used for this optimization and our reasoning for\ntheir beneficial effect. In addition, we presented an architecture and algorithms enabling this information exchange and the processing of received data.\nTo further develop the proposed concept, there are\nseveral topics which require special attention:\n\n6.
