The conductance of a quantum point\ncontact (QPC) - a 1D constriction in a 2D electron gas has been known to be quantized in units of G0 = 2e2 /h\nsince 1988 [1, 2]. The observed conductance plateaus can\nbe easily understood in the single-electron picture [3, 4].\nBelow we write conductance in units of G0 .\nThe \"0.7 structure\" appears on the lowest conductance\nstep as a narrow extra plateau at G \u2248 0.7. The structure\nwas first observed by Thomas et al. in 1996[5] and has\nbeen the subject of numerous experiments since [6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11]. The position of the structure varies from 0.4 to\n0.7 depending on the device, and the structure becomes\nmore pronounced as the temperature is increased up to\n\u223c 2K, where thermal smearing becomes significant. It is\nnot clear from experiment whether the structure survives\nat T = 0. In a longitudinal magnetic field, which breaks\nthe spin degeneracy, the structure evolves smoothly to\nthe 0.5 plateau that is expected in the single-electron\npicture. This demonstrates that the effect is in some\nway related to electron spin.\nObservations of the 0.7 structure have created much\ntheoretical interest. There have been suggested explanations based on spontaneous magnetization within the\ncontact [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], charge density waves\nwithin the contact [18, 19], the Kondo effect [20, 21],\nand even on electron-phonon scattering in the contact\n[22]. The problem has also stimulated the development of\ngeneral scattering theory in the presence of leads [23, 24].\nIn the present paper, using perturbation theory, we\nconsider the finite temperature correction to the Landauer formula for the conductance of a QPC. Our results\nare very similar to experimental data on the 0.7 structure.\nModel. Near the center of the QPC the single-particle\ndynamics are described by the parabolic saddle-point potential U = U0 \u2212 12 m\u03c9 2 x2 + 12 m\u03c9y2 y 2 , see, e.g., Ref. [4].\nHere m is the effective mass, U0 is an energy that can\nbe controlled in experiment using the gate voltage, and\n\u03c9y and \u03c9 are parameters with typical values in experi-\n\nment of \u03c9y /\u03c9 \u223c 3, \u03c9y \u223c 4meV. Throughout the paper\nwe set h\u0304 = kB = 1. The dynamics in the x-direction are\ndescribed by different channels corresponding to quantization in the y-direction. The lowest, n = 0, channel has\nlongitudinal potential \u2212 21 m\u03c9 2 x2 , and hence the transmission probability is [25]\n\u0001\u22121\n,\n(1)\nt\u01eb = 1 + e\u22122\u03c0\u01eb\n\nwhere \u01eb = E/\u03c9, E is the energy. q\nAt \u01eb = 0 the turning\n2n\u03c9\npoint for the nth channel is xt = \u00b1 m\u03c92y . So outside the\n\u221a\nbarrier, from x2D \u223c 2/ m\u03c9, many transverse channels\nare occupied and hence the electron-electron Coulomb\ninteraction is strongly screened. The interaction is unscreened only on the top of the barrier where the electron\ndensity is low. Therefore the effective electron-electron\ninteraction in the n = 0 channel can be approximated as\ne2\n\u2192 Hint = \u03c9\u03c0 2 ge \u03b4(\u03be1 )\u03b4(\u03be2 ) ,\n\u03ba|x1 \u2212 x2 |\n\n(2)\n\nwhere e is\u221athe electron charge, \u03ba is the dielectric constant,\nand \u03be = m\u03c9x is the dimensionless distance. In GaAs,\n\u03ba \u2248 13, m \u2248 0.07me , and for \u03c9 \u223cp1meV the dimension2\nless coupling constant ge \u223c \u03c0e2 \u03ba m/\u03c9 is about unity,\nge \u223c 1. Another issue related to the many-body screening is the absence of pronounced structures in higher conductance steps. For higher steps there are always lower\nchannels penetrating the QPC. This leads to high electron density in the contact and hence to screening of the\neffective interaction (2).\nTo represent single-particle wave functions in the n = 0\nchannel we consider a 1D wire of length L with a potential\nbarrier in the middle of the wire. The details of the potential shape are unimportant apart from the parabolic\ntop, see, e. g., [25]. We need the \"wire\" to normalize\nRL\nwave functions according to 0 |\u03c8k |2 dx = 1, since this\nnormalization is convenient for discussion of the nonlocal kinetic equation, see below. The length L, which is\n\n\f2\nof the order of the ballistic mean free path, disappears\nfrom final answers. Away from the barrier the wave function \u03c8k is the standard combination of incident, reflected\nand transmitted waves. Near the potential top the wave\nfunction is of the form, see, e. g., Ref. [25]\n1\n\u03c8k (x) \u2248 \u221a\nL\ns\n\n\u03c6k (\u03be) =\n\n\u0012\n\nmvF2\n2\u03c9\n\n\u00131/4\n\n\u03c6k (\u03be) ,\n\n\u221a\ne\u03c0\u01eb/2\nD\u03bd ( 2\u03bee\u2212i\u03c0/4 ) ,\ncosh(\u03c0\u01eb)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity far from the barrier, D\u03bd is\nthe parabolic cylinder function, and \u03bd = i\u01eb \u2212 12 . Eq. (3)\ncorresponds to the wave incident from the left, k \u2265 0.\nDue to semiclassical slowing, the probability density at\nthe top of the potential,\n\u03c0 exp(\u03c0\u01eb/2)\n\u03c1(\u01eb) = |\u03c6k (0)|2 = \u221a\n,\n2 cosh(\u03c0\u01eb) |\u0393(3/4 \u2212 i\u01eb/2)|2\n\n(4)\n\nis peaked at \u01eb \u2248 0.2, see Fig. 1. This results in enhancement of the interaction (2), and in the end this leads to\nall effects considered in this paper.\n\n\u03a1H\u0395L\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u0395\n\nFIG. 1: The probability density at \u03be = 0 versus the dimensionless energy \u01eb.\ne k\nL m t\u01eb ,\n\nThe current in state (3) is jk =\nand hence the\ntotal current obeys the Landauer formula\nZ\n2e2\nLdk\njk n0k =\nt\u03bc V ,\nJ = 2e\n2\u03c0\nh\neV \u2032\nn0k = nf + s\nn .\n(5)\n2\u03c9 f\nHere n0k is the non-equilibrium occupation number under a small applied voltage V , nf = nf (\u01eb) is the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution, s = k/|k| shows the\ndirection of current flow in a particular state, and n\u2032f =\n\n(1). We have checked numerically that the same is true\nwith up to higher orders in perturbation theory. Thus the\ninteraction (2) treated perturbatively does not influence\nthe Landauer formula and does not materially change the\nshape of the transmission coefficient at zero temperature.\nNonzero temperature requires a consideration of the\ndetails of equilibration. Eq. (5) implies nonlocal equilibration, as the scattering states with s = +1 equilibrate due to collisions in the left lead and the states with\ns = \u22121 equilibrate due to collisions in the right lead. As\na consequence, the many-body density matrix is diagonal not in the basis of plane waves or standing waves,\nbut in the basis of the scattering states (3) (see also Ref.\n[26]). Therefore, the occupation numbers nk , the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix, obey the kink \u2212n0k\nk\n. Here \u03c4 is the relaxation\nnetic equation \u2202n\n\u2202t = \u2212\n\u03c4\ntime in the leads. This equation is in principle equally\nvalid for finite bias, but in the present paper we consider\nonly an infinitesimal bias where n0k is given by Eq. (5).\nTaking into account electron-electron interaction in the\nQPC, we obtain a collision term in the kinetic equation\n[27]\n\u2202nk\nnk \u2212 n0k\n=\u2212\n+ St(nk ) ,\n(6)\n\u2202t\nZ\u03c4\nLdk1 Ldk2 Ldk3\n2\n|Mkk1 k2 k3 |\nSt(nk ) = 2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0 2\u03c0\n\u00d7 [nk2 nk3 (1 \u2212 nk )(1 \u2212 nk1 ) \u2212 nk nk1 (1 \u2212 nk2 )(1 \u2212 nk3 )]\n\u00d7\u03b4(Ek + Ek1 \u2212 Ek2 \u2212 Ek3 ) .\nHere Mkk1 k2 k3 is the matrix element of the interaction\n(2). This matrix element corresponds to the real transition between quantum states, |k, k1 i \u2192 |k2 , k3 i. Therefore in the matrix element the initial and final wave functions are given by (3). This differs from the rule for the\nscattering amplitude, where initial wave functions are\n(\u2212)\ngiven by (3), while final wave functions are \u03c8k (x) =\n\u2217\n\u03c8\u2212k (x) (the Sommerfeld rule, see, e.g., Ref.[28]).\nUsing occupation numbers from (5) and expanding the\ncollision integral up to the first power in the bias V , we\nfind the integral at small temperature, T \u226a \u03c9,\n\n\u2202n\n\n\u2212 \u2202\u01ebf \u2248 \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc); \u03bc is the chemical potential in units of\n\u03c9.\nThe nonlocal kinetic equation. At zero temperature\nthe interaction (2) in the leading order is described by\nthe usual direct and exchange diagrams for the singleparticle scattering amplitude. The corresponding corrections renormalize the frequency \u03c9 in the single particle\npotential and even make the effective potential slightly\nnonparabolic (flattened).

(10) is justified only if the temperature-dependent\ncorrection term is small compared to unity. The term is\ndue to the current of correlated electrons. It will be most\n2\n2\nsignificant within the region 0.5 2eh \u2264 G \u2264 1.0 2eh , since\nabove G = 0.5 electrons can flow without tunnelling. The\nlength L is of the order of the mean free path in the leads,\nvF\nin (10)\nso it is most natural to assume that the factor \u03c4 L\nis of the order of unity, though we cannot exclude some\ndependence of the factor on temperature. In the latter\ncase the T 2 dependence of the correlated current will be\nmodified.\nNote that the correction we have discussed is due to the\ninteraction between electrons with opposite spins. The\ninteraction between electrons with parallel spins vanishes\nbecause the exchange diagram exactly cancels out the\ndirect one for the contact Hamiltonian (2). Therefore\nunder an applied longitudinal magnetic field B we should\ntake \u03c14 (\u03bc) \u2192 \u03c12 (\u03bc)\u03c12 (\u03bc\u2032 ). Here \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc \u2212 (2gs \u03bcB )B/\u03c9,\nwhere gs is the gyromagnetic ratio and \u03bcB is the Bohr\nmagneton. Since \u03c1(\u03bc) is a peaked function, see Fig. 1, a\nmagnetic field B \u223c \u03c9/(2gs \u03bcB ) \u223c 5T effectively switches\noff the interaction. This gives an explanation for the\nsmooth evolution of the 0.7 structure to the 0.5 plateau\nof non-interacting electrons under a magnetic field.\nA set of plots of t\u03bc for different temperatures is shown\nin Fig. 2. Though the result looks quite sensible it is\nobtained for ge \u226a 1.

The first term in K(\u03bc)\n(diagram Fig. 3a) is logarithmically divergent at \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 \u2192\n+\u221e. The divergence is a result of the contact approximation (2). When the energy is large, \u01eb \u226b 1, the wave\n\u221a length\nis smaller than the size of the barrier, \u03bb \u226a 1/ m\u03c9, and\nthe contact approximation fails. To fix the problem, we\nintroduce an ultraviolet cutoff \u039b, \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 \u2264 \u039b. Dependence on the cutoff is weak and we will present all results\nfor \u039b = 2. The integrals in (11) cannot be calculated analytically. However numerical integration is very simple\nand we present a plot of K(\u03bc) in Fig. 4.\nSince the coupling constant ge \u223c 1, the second order correction alone is not sufficient. However in this\nregime the Brueckner approximation [29] usually works\nwell. Since the kernel K(\u03bc) is independent of external\nmomenta, the Brueckner approximation is equivalent to\nthe summation of a geometrical progression, and hence\nthe renormalized coupling constant gR is\n2\ngR\n= ge2 R(\u03bc) ,\n\nR(\u03bc) =\n\n1\n.\n[1 \u2212 2ge K(\u03bc)]2\n\n(12)\n\nPlots of R(\u03bc) for ge = 1 and ge = 2 are presented in\nFig. 4.

According to our calculation the exact position of the structure\ndepends on the coupling constant ge : for small ge it is\nmore like a \"0.5 structure\" and for ge \u223c 1 it is a \"0.6\u20130.7\nstructure\".\nIn conclusion. Within perturbation theory, we have\nconsidered transport of correlated electrons through a\nquantum point contact. At zero temperature, the approach results in the usual Landauer formula and the\nconductance does not show any structures. To describe\nthe current at nonzero temperature we have formulated\na nonlocal kinetic equation for the occupation numbers.\nA current of correlated electrons scales as temperature\nsquared at very low temperatures. The corresponding\ncorrection to conductance is negative and strongly en2\n2\nhanced in the region 0.5 2eh \u2264 G \u2264 1.0 2eh . We believe\nthat these results are directly relevant to the 0.7 conductance structure. For the case of weak coupling, the set\nof plots of the conductance for different temperatures is\nshown in Fig. 2. The corresponding plots for intermediate coupling, which is probably the regime most relevant\nto experiment, is shown in Fig. 5. Our model is consistent\nwith the experimental behavior of the 0.7 structure under\na magnetic field: a field smoothly \"switches off\" the effective interaction between electrons.
