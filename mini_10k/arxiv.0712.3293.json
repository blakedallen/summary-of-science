For instance, since they\nare sensitive to the expansion history of the Universe, their\nabundance and spatial distribution (e.g. Viana & Liddle\n1996; Wang & Steinhardt 1998; Horellou & Berge 2005;\nNunes, da Silva & Aghanim 2006; Manera & Mota 2006)\nand their mass function (e.g. Lokas, Bode & Hoffman 2004)\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Berg\u00e9 et al.\n\ndepend on cosmological parameters, such as the dark energy equation of state parameter w (e.g. Basilakos 2003;\nMaor & Lahav 2005; Basilakos & Voglis 2007), or the power\nspectrum normalisation \u03c38 (e.g. Seljak 2002; Pierpaoli et al.\n2003). Several observational methods now permit the use of\nclusters of galaxies as cosmological probes, such as X-ray\nobservations, weak gravitational lensing and the SunyaevZeldovich effect.\nDue to improvements in telescopes and techniques, X-ray studies are able to constrain cluster physics and the mass scaling relation with ever\ngreater precision. For instance, the self-similarity\nfor clusters of galaxies (Eke, Navarro & Frenk 1998;\nArnaud, Aghanim & Neumann 2002) has been observationally verified. Nevertheless, adiabatic simulations still predicts a mass-temperature relation with double the observed\nnormalisation\n(e.g.\nNevalainen, Markevitch & Forman\n2000; Finoguenov, Reiprich & B\u00f6hringer 2001) and the\nself-similarity assumption could break down at low\ntemperatures (T 6 3 keV). Thus, a steepening of the\nmass-temperature (M-T) relation is expected if galaxy\ngroups underwent a preheating by supernovae, or a surge of\nentropy, in their early days (Bialek, Evrard & Mohr 2001;\nMuanwong et al. 2002). Recent evidence for this steepening\nwas found by e.g. Nevalainen, Markevitch & Forman (2000);\nFinoguenov, Reiprich & B\u00f6hringer (2001), or Arnaud,\nPointecouteau & Pratt 2005 (APP05 hereafter), but could\nnot be seen by e.g. Ettori, De Grandi & Molendi (2002);\nCastillo-Morales & Schindler\n(2003);\nVikhlinin et al.\n(2006). Moreover, the M-T normalisation estimation is\ncurrently limited by systematics in measuring cluster\nmasses from their X-ray profiles. This limitation can be\nlifted by using probes which are independent of the physical\nstate of the cluster.\nBeyond galaxy cluster physics, the M-T relation is\nneeded by X-ray experiments to estimate the power spectrum normalisation \u03c38 . Measuring this parameter has triggered much effort in several observational areas. For instance, CMB experiments (e.g. Spergel et al. 2007) tend to\na low value for \u03c38 (6 0.8), weak lensing experiments tend\nto higher values (> 0.8), and X-ray observations provide\nintermediate values.\nGravitational lensing does not depend on the underlying physics of clusters of galaxies or dark matter, but only on\ntheir potential wells, and on the Universe's geometry. Strong\ngravitational lensing has been used for galaxy clusters\nphysics (e.g. Mellier, Fort & Kneib 1993; Kneib et al. 1995,\n1996; Smail et al. 1997; Luppino et al. 1999; Smith et al.\n2005) and measurement of \u03c38 (e.g. Smith et al. 2003).\nWeak gravitational lensing is more difficult to measure\n(for reviews, see e.g. Mellier 1999; Bartelmann & Schneider\n2001; Refregier 2003a; Munshi et al. 2006)), and has\ntaken longer to be detected (Bacon, Refregier & Ellis\n2000; van Waerbeke et al. 2000; Wittman et al. 2000;\nRhodes, Refregier & Groth 2001). Since then, particular attention has been given to cosmic shear, i.e. statistical cosmological weak lensing (e.g. Bacon et al. 2003; Heymans et al.\n2005; Massey et al. 2005, 2007a; Hoekstra et al. 2006;\nSemboloni et al. 2006; Schrabback et al. 2007), in attempts\nto measure w and \u03c38 . It has also begun to be used as\na tracer of the cosmic web (e.g. Massey et al. 2007b),\nand a way to detect and catalogue mass overdensi-\n\nties (e.g. Wittman et al. 2006, Gavazzi & Soucail 2007,\nGS07 hereafter, and Miyazaki et al. 2007). Beside the constraints it can bring to cosmology, it can be used as\na complement to X-ray analyses of clusters of galaxies. Thanks to the physics-independent estimation of cluster masses, it appears as a unique method to calibrate\nthe mass-temperature relation for clusters of galaxies\n(e.g. Hjorth, Oukbir & van Kampen 1998; Huterer & White\n2002; Pedersen & Dahle 2006; Bardeau et al. 2007). It has\nbeen shown that the uncertainty in the normalisation of the\nmass-temperature relation is the largest source of error in \u03c38\nmeasurements inferred from X-ray cluster analyses (Seljak\n2002; Pierpaoli et al. 2003). An accurate mass-temperature\nrelation, obtained from combined weak lensing and X-ray\nanalyses, will thus provide new insights not only on the \u03c38\ndiscrepancy, but also on galaxy cluster physics.\n\nIn this paper, we present the first joint analysis\nof weak gravitational lensing and X-ray wide-area surveys of a randomly-selected patch of sky. The weak lensing survey is derived from the CFHTLS, and the X-ray\nsurvey from the XMM-LSS. The weak lensing analysis\nuses shapelets (Refregier 2003b; Refregier & Bacon 2003;\nMassey & Refregier 2005), a new generation shear measurement technique, which has been shown to achieve a few percent accuracy in shear measurement from ground based telescopes (Massey et al. 2007c). We analyse one square-degree\nof the CFHTLS Deep survey (the D1 field) and four contiguous square degrees of the CFHTLS Wide survey, which\nenclose the D1 field. We create convergence maps for this region of the sky and give a catalogue of detections. We show\nhow counting weak-lensing-selected clusters can provide an\nestimate of the power spectrum normalisation \u03c38 . We then\nshow how the combination of weak lensing and X-ray analyses of clusters provides an estimate of the mass-temperature\nrelation normalisation T\u2217 , independent of clusters physical\nstate. Finally, we investigate the impact of a joint weak lensing and X-ray survey strategy on the accuracy of the \u03c38 and\nT\u2217 measurement. We consider deep and wide weak lensing\nsurveys, with the CFHTLS characteristics, combined with a\nblind X-ray survey of the same region of the sky.\n\nThe organisation of the paper is as follows. Section 2\npresents the surveys used in this paper, namely the CFHTLS\nand the XMM-LSS. The methods that we use are described\nin section 3. We show how we estimate the weak lensing effect using shapelets, and how we generate convergence maps\nand detect clusters. We also briefly describe how the X-ray\nproperties of clusters are obtained. Section 4 presents the\nconvergence map we inferred from our weak lensing analysis, and gives a catalogue of the galaxy clusters that we\ndetect. We then give our estimates of the normalisation of\nthe power spectrum and of the M-T relation. We then show\nin section 5 that combined blind surveys are necessary to get\nthe best insights about those normalisations. The impact of\nsurvey strategy on those parameters estimations is discussed\nin section 6. We conclude in section 7.\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fCombined analysis of weak lensing and X-ray blind surveys\n2\n\nDATA\n\n2.1\n\nWeak lensing : CFHTLS\n\nThe \"Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey\" 1\n(CFHTLS), a joint France-Canada project, consists of three\ndifferent surveys, namely the Very Wide Survey, the Wide\nSynoptic Survey (referred to as \"Wide survey\" hereafter),\nand the Deep Survey. Once complete, the Wide Survey will\ncover 170 deg2 (divided into four distinct patches ranging\nfrom 49 deg2 to 72 deg2 ) in five filters (u*,g',r',i',z'), down\nto a magnitude i\u2032 \u2248 24.5. Its main goal is the study of large\nscale structures by weak gravitational lensing and galaxy\ncounts. The Deep Survey covers 4 different fields, each with\nan area of 1 deg2 , in the same five filters, down to i\u2032 \u2248 28.5.\nIt is primarily intended for Type Ia Supernovae studies but\nit is also useful for measuring large-scale structures. The\nCFHTLS images were obtained from observations with the\nMegaCam camera, made of a 36 CCD mosaic, of 2048 \u00d7\n4196 pixels each, with a 1 deg2 field of view (Boulade et al.\n2003).\nIn this paper, we present the weak gravitational lensing\nbased mapping of 4 deg2 of the Wide Survey (W1 patch),\nwhich include the 1 deg2 field of the Deep Survey (D1 field),\nusing both W1 and D1 images. The geometry of the fields\nthat we use is shown in Figure 1. The data processing (astrometry, photometric calibration, stacking of images) has\nbeen done by the CFHT community and Terapix 2 . We use\nW1 images optimised for weak lensing : each field is the combination of 7 stacked images, each of 620 seconds exposure\ntime. We use the T0003 release of the D1 field, consisting of\n275 stacked images, with a total 37.4 hour exposure time.\nThe average seeing is 0.7 arcsec. We masked parts of the images with saturated stars and/or too high a noise, by hand,\nso as not to bias our weak lensing results. This operation\nremoves 10% of the original area covered by the data. We\ndo not mask the ghosts created by spurious reflections on\nthe telescope optics around saturated stars, but we eventually remove the galaxies that they cover from our catalogues,\nsince they are too noisy. The average galaxy density is 28\narcmin\u22122 in the D1 image, and 13 arcmin\u22122 in the W1 images.\n\n2.2\n\nX-ray : XMM-LSS\n\nDesigned to cover an area of several tens of square degrees\nup to a redshift z = 1, the XMM-LSS survey aims at detecting a significant fraction of clusters of galaxies, in order to constitute a sample suited to cosmological studies\n(Pierre et al. 2004). Its nominal exposure times are 10 ks,\nand have been raised up to 20 ks for the XMM Medium\nDeep Survey (XMDS : Chiappetti et al. 2005), a 2 deg2 region included in the XMM-LSS, which covers the CFHTLS\nD1 field. In this paper, we use 4 deg2 of the XMM-LSS which\ncover our 4 deg2 CFHTLS data. The XMM pointings are\nshown on Figure 1. The raw X-ray observations reduction is\npresented in Pacaud et al. (2006).\n\n1\n2\n\nc\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHLS/\nhttp://terapix.iap.fr\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nFigure 1. Layout of the surveys. The red square is the CFHTLS\nD1 field. The four green squares are the four CFHTLS W1 fields\nused in this paper. Circles represent the XMM-LSS pointings\navailable in that region, prior to XMM AO5 (Pacaud et al. 2007).\nHere, we only used those lying within the optical data. Those\nmarked by a cross are strongly affected by flares and are being\nre-observed.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMETHOD\nWeak lensing cluster detection\n\nIntroduced in Refregier 2003b, Refregier & Bacon 2003 and\nMassey & Refregier 2005, shapelets are a complete, orthogonal, set of basis functions with which one can analytically\ndecompose galaxy shapes. They can be seen as fundamental shapes : a particular galaxy can be represented by a\nparticular sum of shapelets basis functions \u03c7n,m , weighted\nby coefficients fn,m . Their rich formalism provides an intuitive and analytic form for geometrical transformations\n(such as smear, shear, rotation) and for (de)convolution.\nHence, they allow one to analytically describe the smearing of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the shear of\ngalaxies, properly correcting for the PSF. The shear estimation they provide has been shown to reach the needed accuracy for the CFHTLS specifications by the STEP project\n(Massey et al. 2007c).\nOur full pipeline will be described in an upcoming paper\n(Berg\u00e9 et al. in prep). We briefly summarise it here. Each\nsufficiently bright and non-saturated star is first decomposed\ninto shapelets. A polynomial interpolation of each shapelet\ncoefficient then provides a model of its spatial variations\nacross the image. We are thus able to reconstruct the shape\nof the PSF at the position of each galaxy, the condition\nnecessary for deconvolving it from the galaxies' shapes. Several stringent tests then validate our PSF model. In particular, we require that the ellipticity distribution, and the two\npoint correlation functions of the ellipticity, of the residuals\nbetween observed stars and their shapelet models are con-\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Berg\u00e9 et al.\n\nsistent with zero. We also require that the cross-correlation\nbetween stars and galaxies ellipticity, when corrected from\nthe PSF, is consistent with zero. The shape of galaxies is\nfinally measured by decomposing them into shapelets, while\ndeconvolving from the PSF, as shown in Massey & Refregier\n2005.\nA shear estimator is created from the shapelet decompositions of galaxies, as prescribed by Massey et al. 2007d:\n\u03b3=\n\nf2,2\nP\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the shear susceptibility P \u03b3 =< f0,0 \u2212 f4,0 > / 2 is\nfitted on the magnitude-size plane for galaxies. The coefficients are complex numbers. The shear \u03b3 of equation (1) is\nthe complex notation for shears, \u03b3 = \u03b31 + i\u03b32 .\nTo increase the signal to noise ratio of our measurements, we give to each galaxy g a minimum variance weight\n2\n2 \u22121\nwg = (\u03c3\u03b5,g\n+ \u03c3P2 \u03b3 ,g + \u03c3int\n) , where \u03c3\u03b5,g is the error on\nshape measurement for galaxy g, \u03c3P\u03b3,g the error on the measurement of its shear susceptibility, and \u03c3int is the intrinsic\nellipticity dispersion, set to \u03c3int = 0.3. Slightly changing\n\u03c3int would be equivalent to giving more or less weight to\nour measurement errors, and would mostly affect the error\nbars in the shear measurement. The eventual peak detection\nwould not be affected by such slight changes. This weighting\nscheme is equivalent to smoothly selecting the most useful\ngalaxies for shear measurement. For instance, the faintest\nare down-weighted. It therefore provides us with effective\ndensities of neff \u2248 20 and 9 useful galaxies per square arcminute, in the D1 and W1 images, respectively. Then, a\ndirect inversion in Fourier space of the pixelised shear map\nallows us to infer a convergence (i.e. projected mass) map\n(Kaiser & Squires 1993) of the images. Structures in this\nmass map are extracted from the noise using a Gaussian\nfilter. Figures 2 and 3 show the convergence maps that we\ninferred from our data. These are described in section 4.1.\nWhile constructing a convergence map, we also create a\nsignal-to-noise map, the signal-to-noise ratio being defined\nas\n\u03bd(x, y) =\n\n\u03ba(x, y)\n,\n\u03c3\u03ba (x, y)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03ba(x, y) is the convergence at the (x, y) sky coordinates, and \u03c3\u03ba (x, y) its r.m.s error. The r.m.s error \u03c3\u03ba (x, y)\nis computed using Monte-Carlo simulations in which the input galaxies are positioned like the observed ones but with\nrandomised shape orientations.\nStructures are then searched for in the filtered convergence map, and their astrometry provided, by the SExtractor software (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). They are extracted\naccording to their signal-to-noise peak, read from the signalto-noise map. Hereafter, we define a 'significant structure'\nas a detection with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than\n2.5. Their mass is related to their integrated convergence\nthrough the lensing geometry, and can be estimated when\ntheir redshift and the redshift distribution of background\ngalaxies are known. To account for the latter, we use the\nnormalised distribution\n\u03b2\nn(z) =\nzs \u0393( 1+\u03b1\n)\n\u03b2\n\n\u0010\n\nz\nzs\n\n\u0011\u03b1\n\n\u0014 \u0010\n\nz\nexp \u2212\nzs\n\n\u0011\u03b2 \u0015\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, zs are given for the Wide images\n\nby Benjamin et al. (2007) (\u03b1, \u03b2, zs ) = (0.836, 3.425, 1.171).\nTo account for n(z) in the D1 image, we fit Ilbert et al.\n(2006)'s photometric redshift distribution in the CFHTLS\nD1 field, and obtain (\u03b1, \u03b2, zs ) = (0.828, 1.859, 1.148).\nvan Waerbeke et al. (2006) have shown that errors in the\nn(z) fit are subdominant compared to Poisson noise and\nsample variance for the measurement of cosmological parameters. We thus neglect them hereafter.\nWe measure a cluster's virial mass by averaging its convergence in an aperture large enough that we can assume\nthat the entire cluster is captured. The aperture corresponds\nto the region enclosed in the 2\u03c3 level of the cluster's convergence map. This technique is similar to using a \u03b6-statistic\n(Fahlman et al. 1994), with infinitely large annulus around\nthe cluster, provided that the convergence in the entire field\naverages to 0. We verified this latter point, thus validating\nour choice. Note that because of the small number density\nof background sources, we cannot reliably fit a shear profile\naround clusters (see e.g. Paulin-Henriksson et al. (2007) for\nan example of mass estimation using two profile fits around\nthe galaxy cluster Abell 209). We then convert the virial\nmass into M200,c , the mass enclosed in the sphere of mean\noverdensity 200 times higher than the critical density, using\nthe recipe from Hu & Kravtsov (2003). Hereafter, we will\nnote M200,c more briefly M200 .\nWeak lensing is affected by the entire mass distribution along the line of sight. As a result, the weak lensing mass measurement of one cluster is biased by projection effects. It has been shown, using different mass estimators, that large-scale structures in the line of sight, and\nnear the target cluster, introduce errors ranging from a\nfew percent (Reblinsky & Bartelmann 1999; Hoekstra 2001,\n2003; Clowe, De Lucia & King 2004) to a few tens of percent\n(Metzler, White & Loken 2001; de Putter & White 2005).\nIn this paper, we assume that they produce a 20% error,\nadded in quadrature to the shear measurement error.\n3.2\n\nX-ray cluster detection and analysis\n\nThe X-ray cluster detection pipeline has been described in\nPacaud et al. (2006). It takes account of the Poisson nature\nof the X-ray images, to extract and analyse clusters of galaxies in a two-step procedure. Clusters are first detected by\na multi-resolution wavelet filter (Starck et al. 1998). Then,\neach source is analysed using a maximum likelihood profile\nfitting procedure, and its X-ray properties assessed. Three\nclasses of extended sources have been defined (Pacaud et al.\n2006; Pierre et al. 2006) : (1) the C1 class contains the highest surface brightness sources, and is uncontaminated ; (2)\nthe C2 class allows for 50 % contamination, and contains less\nbright extended sources ; (3) finally, the C3 class contains\noptically confirmed sources with apparent X-ray emission,\nthat were not selected as C1 or C2. In this paper, we only\nconsider C1 class detections, representative of the most massive objects seen in the XMM-LSS. The redshift of detected\nclusters has been measured using spectroscopic observations\nfrom a number of telescope and instrument combinations detailed in Table 2 of Pierre et al. (2006). Their temperature\nestimation is described in Willis et al. (2005).\nPacaud et al. (2007) have extracted and analysed 29 C1\nclusters from 5 deg2 of the XMM-LSS data (shown on Fig.\n1), that contain our 4 deg2 optical data. Among other things,\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fCombined analysis of weak lensing and X-ray blind surveys\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

Dashed circles mark C1 X-ray clusters.\n\nthey have measured their luminosity and temperature. Here,\nwe take into account their 16 clusters which are enclosed in\nthe fields of our CFHTLS data, making use only of their\ntemperature and redshift. They are listed in Table 1. Note\nthat the cluster XLSSC053 is in the G12 XMM-LSS pointing\n(shown by the cross in the D1 field, on Fig. 1), which was\nnot used when Pacaud et al. (2007) analysed the XMM-LSS\nobservations. This pointing has been re-observed, and the\nX-ray characteristics of XLSSC053 are listed in Table 1.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section, we give the properties of clusters of galaxies detected with our weak lensing pipeline. Counting the\nweak lensing detections allows us to constrain the matter\npower spectrum normalisation \u03c38 . We then use the weak\nlensing mass of the detected groups to calibrate the masstemperature relation for clusters of galaxies.\n\n4.1\n\nConvergence maps and cluster catalogue\n\nFigure 2 shows the 4 deg2 of the W1 field that we considered. No significant overdensity (i.e. with \u03bd > 2.5) has been\ndetected. As we will quantitatively show in section 4.2.1,\nthis is consistent with the expected cluster counts for this\nsurvey. The black square in the image shows the position of\nthe D1 field. Since there are around 20 galaxies per arcmin2 ,\nwe expect more significant detections in this deep field (see\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nsection 4.2.1). The upper panel of Fig. 3 shows the convergence map that we obtained from our weak lensing analysis of the D1 field. Due to the varying level of noise in\nour map, which varies independently of \u03ba, two peaks with\nthe same \u03ba value do not necessarily have the same significance. That results in the rejection of seemingly significant\nstructures, such as the peak around (\u03b1, \u03b4)=(36.75o , \u22124.75o ).\nSignificant structures are marked out by the white contours, which start at 2.2\u03c3, with an increment of 0.5\u03c3. The\nlower panels show individual candidate clusters in more details. In these, contours start at 2.2\u03c3, with an increment\nof 0.2\u03c3. Even though we consider as significant a structure\nwith \u03bd > 2.5, we plot the 2.2\u03c3 contours as a way to show\nthe extension of our detections. Dashed circles mark X-ray\nclusters, and dotted circles GS07's weak lensing detections.\nGS07 measured the shear in the D1 field using the KSB\nmethod (Kaiser, Squires & Broadhurst 1995).\nTable 1 summarises the measured characteristics of the\nclusters that we detect, together with all X-ray and GS07's\ndetections in the region. The clusters that we detect through\nour shapelets weak lensing analysis are labelled with WLid,\nwhere id runs from 00 to 07, and are sorted by decreasing\nsignificance. Their labels are listed in the first column. Their\nofficial XMM names are given in column (2), and GS07's IDs\nin the third column. X-ray clusters marked by a \u2020 are outside\nthe D1 field. Columns (4) and (5) give their position. Column (6) lists their spectroscopic redshifts, except for clusters\nWL03, for which a tomographic redshift is given, and WL04\nfor which a photometric redshift is given (Aussel et al. in\nprep).

Columns (8) and (9) give their weak lensing mass M200 (WL) and X-ray temperature, respectively.\nColumn (10) gives the mass estimate from the X-ray data,\nM200 (X). As in Pacaud et al. (2007), these were evaluated\nunder the assumption of an isothermal \u03b2-model gas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster's potential\nwell. In this earlier work, the associated statistical errors\nwere generally dominated by the temperature measurement\nuncertainty (\u03b4M/M \u2248 \u03b4T /T of order 10-25%). Here, the\nerror on the emission profile can also become quite significant because we estimate the masses within R200 instead of\nR500 where the X-ray emission starts to vanish. Moreover, it\nwas shown by Vikhlinin et al. (2006) and Rasia et al. (2006)\nthat the isothermal \u03b2-model assumption leads to an underestimation of the total mass, by up to 40% for low mass\nsystems. For these reasons, we decided not to provide error bars for our X-ray masses. Finally, column (11) gives\nsome details about weak lensing detections, explaining for\ninstance why we chose not to take them into account, or why\nwe do not detect a cluster seen by another method.

In that sense, and for\nclarity, the detections closest to edges have been removed\nfrom Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.\nClusters WL01, WL04 and WL05 have unequivocal\ncounterparts both in our X-ray catalogue and in GS07's KSB\none. No significant C1 X-ray source has been selected around\nWL02, and it remains invisible to GS07. Moreover, a visual\ninspection of the optical images does not show any galaxy\noverdensity around it. No significant C1 X-ray source has\nbeen detected at the position of WL03, even though it is\nalso seen by GS07. Cluster WL06 lies just below our detection threshold (\u03bd = 2.48). Nevertheless, since GS07 detect\nit (though just below the detection threshold they use for\ntheir analyses) and since it is also detected by our X-ray\nanalysis, we decided to list it, and to assess its weak lensing characteristics. The significance of cluster WL07 is even\nlower (\u03bd = 2.42). Since it is found close to the XLSSC022\ncluster (which coincides with GS07's Cl07), we show its contours in Fig. 3 and list it in Table 1. However, it lies near\nan edge and a mask, so that its weak lensing characteristics\nare likely to be biased. We thus do not measure its mass,\nand will not take it into account in what follows. Cluster\nXLSSC025 (GS07's Cl05) is under a mask, and cannot be\ndetected by our pipeline.\n\n\f8\n\nJ. Berg\u00e9 et al.\n\nIn summary, out of our 7 shapelet weak lensing detections, 4 (WL01, WL04, WL05 and WL07) have a counterpart both in our X-ray catalogue and in the KSB weak\nlensing catalogue by GS07, even though we remove WL07\nfrom our subsequent analyses. One detection (WL02) appears only in our catalogue. One (WL06) has an X-ray counterpart, and appears in GS07's map, but just below the detection threshold they use for their analysis. Finally, one\n(WL03) has a counterpart in GS07's catalogue, but is not\nselected as a C1 X-ray cluster. This proves a good agreement\nbetween the three cluster detection methods used in those\nobservations. X-ray clusters XLSSC005 and XLSSC029 are\nat too high a redshift to be detected with our surveys. Cluster XLSSC011 is too close and not massive enough to be\ndetected by weak lensing, as will be shown in section 4.2.1.\nFigure 4 compares the significance of our detections\nwith that given by GS07. We make use of WL06, even\nthough GS07 did not use it, but gave its significance.\nGiven our weak lensing measurement characteristics (neff =\n19 arcmin\u22122 , \u03c3int = 0.3) and theirs (neff = 25.3 arcmin\u22122 ,\n\u03c3int = 0.23), Eq. (4) below allows us to compute the expected proportionality factor between our detections' significance \u03bdshapelets and theirs, \u03bdGS07 . We expect \u03bdGS07 =\n1.47 \u03bdshapelets . This relation is shown by the dashed line on\nFig. 4. The significance of clusters in both catalogues scale\nas expected. One should note that this relation depends on\nthe measurement characteristics for both methods in those\nparticular experiments, and should not be used as a final\ncomparison between KSB and shapelets. More comparison\non real data will be needed in order to explore this issue.\nWhile X-ray masses listed in column (10) of Table\n1 must be taken with caution, they can be compared to\nthe weak lensing masses listed in column (8). Although\none can notice an order of magnitude agreement between\nM200 (WL) and M200 (X), masses estimated from X-ray data\nseem slightly underestimated. This is consistent with the\npreviously mentioned bias arising from the isothermal betamodel parametrisation.\nWhile they do not provide strong statistics, our detections can be used to estimate \u03c38 , as shown below. Four detections have an X-ray counterpart and can thus be used\nto constrain the mass-temperature relation, provided that\nwe add clusters from another catalogue. This is described\nbelow.\n\n4.2\n\nClusters number counts\n\n4.2.1\n\nWeak lensing selection function\n\nA weak gravitational lensing selection function can be\ncomputed analytically (see e.g. Hamana, Takada & Yoshida\n2004; Marian & Bernstein 2006) from the signal-to-noise ratio of a halo in a given cosmology and weak lensing survey parameters. We derive such a selection function, using\nan optimal match filter, in Berg\u00e9, Amara & R\u00e9fr\u00e9gier (in\nprep).

We use\nthe redshift distributions for background galaxies given by\nequation (3).\nFigure 5 shows, from bottom to top, the minimum detectable mass for a halo at a 2\u03c3, a 3\u03c3 and a 4\u03c3 detection\nthreshold. The Deep and Wide selection functions have different slopes, as a consequence of their different redshift\ndistribution for background galaxies. Symbols represent the\nposition, in the redshift-mass plane, of clusters listed in Table 1. We use the weak lensing mass M200 (WL) for WL01,\nWL03, WL04, WL05 and WL06 (thick square symbols) and\nthe X-ray mass M200 (X) for other clusters (diamonds). Although we detect cluster XLSSC022 (WL07), we do not assess its gravitational mass, and thus show its X-ray mass\nin Fig. 5. Cluster XLSSC025 should be detectable (and is\ndetected by GS07), but it is under a mask in our analysis.\nTriangle symbols (labeled \u2020 in Table 1) correspond to C1 Xray clusters in W1 that are outside the D1 region. It is clear\nfrom Figure 5 that they can not be detected by our weak\nlensing analysis of W1. Only XLSSC006 should be seen, at\nthe 2\u03c3 level. However, its detection is plagued by its proximity to the edge of the image.\nAlso shown on Fig. 5 are the X-ray selection functions,\nfor 50% and 80% detection probabilities (dashed lines) as\nestimated by Pacaud et al. (2007).\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fCombined analysis of weak lensing and X-ray blind surveys\n\nFigure 5.

From bottom to top, lines correspond to 2\u03c3, 3\u03c3 and 4\u03c3\nsignificance. Dashed lines show the X-ray selection function, corresponding to 50%, and 80% detection probability (Pacaud et al.\n2007 Fig. 18, lower and upper curves, respectively). Thick square\nsymbols are our detections in the D1 data, labeled by their ID ;\nthey are not detectable in the W1 data. Diamonds are clusters detected either by GS07 or by X-ray analysis, in D1, that we do not\ndetect for reasons listed in the text. Red triangles are C1 X-ray\nclusters lying outside the D1 region. Except for the thick square\nsymbols (for which we use the weak lensing mass M200 (WL)),\nwe use the X-ray mass M200 (X). Except XLSSC006 (labeled for\nvisibility as X006), they cannot be detected by a weak lensing\nexperiment in the W1 data. XLSSC006 is not detected because\nof its proximity to an edge.\n\nFigure 5 shows an excellent agreement between the clusters characteristics and their predicted detectability by weak\ngravitational lensing.\n\n4.2.2\n\nNumber counts\n\nFrom equation (4), the expected number of haloes detected\nabove a certain significance can be computed using a PressSchechter approach (Press & Schechter 1974). For this purpose, we use the Jenkins et al. (2001) mass function to estimate the number of haloes that we can detect, as a function of significance threshold. Curves on figure 6 show such\ncounts for different \u03c38 and survey depths. Miyazaki et al.\n(2002) already used this statistic to discriminate between\nhalo profile models. It is used here to measure \u03c38 .\nMost of our detections are validated by corresponding\nobjects either in the catalogue of GS07 or our X-ray C1 cluster catalogue. Nevertheless, despite its relative high significance, WL02 does not have such independent support. We\nindeed consider it as a false detection, and do not take it into\naccount for cluster counts. We then estimate the number of\nfalse detections from Monte Carlo simulations. For this purpose, we input galaxies at the position of the actual ones,\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n9\n\nFigure 6.

The dashed line shows the\nexpected number counts in a WMAP3 cosmology, for the survey's\ncharacteristics. The solid line is our best fit, when varying \u03c38\n(\u03c38 = 0.92). The dot-dashed line is the expected number counts\nfor the Wide survey, with \u03c38 = 0.92.\n\nbut randomise their shear, and look for detections with significance higher than 2.5\u03c3. The convergence maps that we\ninfer from them show only false detections. We find that, in\nthis particular experiment, we expect only one false detection above the 2.5\u03c3 level. This is thus consistent with removing WL02. For this counting purpose, we remove WL06\nand WL07 from our catalogue, since they do not reach the\n2.5\u03c3 level. The symbols on Fig. 6 represent our cumulative\ncounts, corrected from false detections. Their error bars include the effects of shot noise and sample variance, computed\nfrom Hu & Kravtsov's (2003) analytic formula. We then fit\nthe expected number counts to our data as a function of \u03c38 ,\nkeeping all other parameters constant. In order to avoid covariance between our data points in the cumulative counts\ndepicted by Fig. 6, we performed the fit on the expected differential number counts dN/d\u03bd(\u03bd). We find \u03c38 = 0.92+0.26\n\u22120.30\n(at the 68.3% confidence limit), for \u03a9m = 0.24. Despite large\nerror bars, we can set interesting constraints thanks to the\nstrong dependence of these counts on \u03c38 , as shown by the difference between the solid and dashed curves in Figure 6. The\ndashed line shows the expected cumulative number counts\nfor the Deep survey in a WMAP3-like universe (\u03c38 = 0.76).\nThe solid line is our best fit (\u03c38 = 0.92).

We compute it using\nthe fitting formula by Weinberg & Kamionkowski (2003) for\n\u2206vir = \u2206c /\u03a9m , which is very similar to an earlier approximation by Nakamura (1996) given by Kitayama & Suto\n(1996) for a universe with arbitrary \u03a9m .\nA more general relation often used to fit observations\nmakes use of a related normalisation factor M\u2217 and is given,\nat redshift z = 0, by\nM200 \u2248 M\u2217\n\n\u0010 T\n\n4 keV\n\n\u0011\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere M200 is the mass inside the sphere of mean overdensity 200 times higher than the critical density and \u03b1 = 3/2 in\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium assumption (e.g. APP05). Hereafter, to account for redshift evolution, we normalise all our\ntemperatures to z = 0 by dividing them by E(z)2/3 .\nMeasuring \u03c38 from X-ray counts is affected by\n\u22120.8\nthe degeneracy \u03a90.6\n(Pierpaoli et al. 2003).\nm \u03c38 \u221d T \u2217\nPierpaoli et al. (2003) have shown that the uncertainty in\nM\u2217 is the main concern in measurements of \u03c38 from X-ray\ncluster observations alone. Such data is limited by the requirement that the cluster masses be inferred from the Xray profiles. Smith et al. (2003) have also shown that unrelaxed clusters, being hotter than relaxed clusters, provide a supplementary bias to the \u03c38 estimate. It is thus\nimportant to have a mass estimate independent of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. Weak gravitational lensing gives such an estimate. Combined with X-ray tem-\n\nperature, it can be efficiently used to constraint the MT relation, independently of the cluster physical state.\nHjorth, Oukbir & van Kampen (1998); Pedersen & Dahle\n(2006); Bardeau et al. (2007) have already used it to measure the M-T relation normalisation.\nAs described above, we have the weak lensing mass\nand X-ray temperature of only four groups. Hence, to increase our statistics, we add Bardeau et al. (2007)'s clusters\nto our catalogue, providing us with 11 additional clusters.\nBardeau et al. (2007) estimated cluster masses by fitting an\nNFW model to their tangential shears. We should note here\nthat since Bardeau et al. (2007)'s mass estimation and ours\nare based on different techniques, our subsequent analysis of\nthe mass - temperature relation could be slightly biased due\nto possible calibration differences. Figure 7 shows the relation between the temperature and the weak lensing mass\nM200 for the combined catalogues. Diamonds are our groups,\nlabelled WLid, triangles are Bardeau et al. (2007)'s clusters,\nlabelled Aid. Bardeau et al. (2007) proceeded to the weak\nlensing analyses of massive haloes, the temperature of which\nwere obtained by Zhang et al. (2007) and Ota & Mitsuda\n(2004) ; particularly, they estimated their weak lensing mass\nand measured the scale relations for those clusters. They\nfitted their sample by varying both \u03b1 and M\u2217 , and found\na large slope, far from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, \u03b1 = 4.6 \u00b1 0.7. Doing the same analysis on the larger\nrange in mass that the addition of both catalogues probes,\nfrom galaxy groups to galaxy clusters, we find :\nM200\n+0.79\n(5) 1014 h\u22121 M = 2.71\u22120.61\n\u2299\n\n\u0010 T\n\n4 keV\n\n\u00111.60\u00b10.44\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is in good agreement with APP05 (whether they use\nall clusters or only the most massive ones), Bardeau et al.\n(2007) (when they fix \u03b1 = 1.5), Pedersen & Dahle (2006) or\nHoekstra (2007). The solid line on Fig. 7 is our best fit. The\ndashed line is the best fit from APP05, when they consider\nall clusters in their catalogue. The dotted line is their best\nfit when they consider their most massive clusters (T >\n3.5 keV).\nOur result is consistent with self-similarity evolution for\ngalaxy clusters down to low temperatures. It is also consistent with previous measurements which observe a steepening\nof the M-T relation at the low mass end, due to the expected\nself-similarity breaking for such masses (e.g. Nevalainen et\nal. 2000; Finoguenov et al. 2001; APP05). Moreover, one\nmust be aware that the galaxy groups we consider were detected just above our weak lensing selection function (Fig.\n5). Due to the expected scatter in the M-T relation, those\ngroups can represent only the most massive ones with temperature ranging about 1 keV. Our group sample could thus\nbias our fit towards a flat slope for the M-T relation. The\nanalysis of more low temperature groups will be needed to\nfurther explore this issue.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe power spectrum normalisation \u03c38 has been measured\nwith different probes, such as X-ray clusters of galaxies,\nCMB, and cosmic shear (i.e. statistics of weak gravitational\nlensing). Some discrepancies have emerged between the preferred value from those measurements.

Thick lines are\nour best fits. The slanted black region correspond to the 1\u03c3 con\u22120.8\n0.6 \u03c3\nstraints on the \u03a9m\nrelation from Pierpaoli et al.\n8 \u221d T\u2217\n2003. The vertical, light blue, shaded region shows the 1\u03c3 error\non T\u2217 from APP05. CMB derived constraints of \u03c38 (Spergel et al.\n2007) are shown by the horizontal dark blue shaded region.\nCosmic shear \u03c38 estimations from Hoekstra et al. 2006 and\nBenjamin et al. 2007 are marked by the red and green horizontal shaded regions. Hoekstra et al. 2006's constraints are typical\nof cosmic shear results. They are higher than X-ray estimations,\nmarked by the intersection between Pierpaoli et al. 2003's and\nAPP05's allowed domains.\n\nmade with CFHTLS Wide data (red). This highlights the\ndiscrepancy between X-ray and weak lensing estimates of\n\u03c38 mentioned above. However, Benjamin et al. (2007) give\na lower estimate for \u03c38 , consistent with X-ray measurements\n(green). This could be a sign that other cosmic shear analyses did not take some systematics into account, and have\nthus overestimated \u03c38 . According to Benjamin et al. (2007),\npreviously published analyses made use of insufficientlyaccurate galaxy photometric redshifts. Using Ilbert et al.\n(2006)'s redshifts yielded a lower value of \u03c38 both for cosmic\nshear (Benjamin et al. 2007) and for our cluster count analysis. We found a 5% decrease in our \u03c38 estimation when\ngoing from previous redshift distributions to Ilbert et al.\n(2006)'s ones. This is less than the change reported by\nBenjamin et al. (2007), and our best fit still tends to favour\na higher value for \u03c38 , but is limited by low statistics.\nSmith et al. (2003) have analysed the bias from unrelaxed\nclusters in \u03c38 measurement using lensing clusters and the\nM-T relation. They found that unrelaxed clusters are 30%\nhotter than relaxed clusters : using unrelaxed clusters can\nprovide 20% overestimates of \u03c38 . This is enough to explain\nthe large range of measured \u03c38 , from \u2248 0.6 to \u2248 1. They estimated \u03c38 (\u03a9m /0.24)0.6 = 0.86\u00b10.23. Estimates from X-ray\nalone can also be affected by systematics, such as the mass\nestimate from X-ray profiles of clusters. For example, a slight\ndecrease of T\u2217 would cause an increase of the X-ray estimate\nfor \u03c38 . A better insight into this will come from an accurate\nmeasurement of T\u2217 , preferably with mass estimation methods independent of cluster physics. Large combined weak\nlensing and X-ray surveys will be needed to disentangle the\nsituation. They will provide both independent constraints\non \u03c38 , and insights on T\u2217 .\n\n6\nservations favour a low \u03c38 and cosmic shear used to emphasise a high value (see e.g. Refregier 2003a for a review). X-ray clusters provide intermediate measurements\n(see e.g. Pierpaoli et al. 2003 for a review). The dominant\ndiscrepancy between cosmic shear and X-ray clusters has recently been reduced by Jarvis et al. (2006), who measured\n\u03c38 \u2248 0.81 for \u03a9m = 0.26 when using cosmic shear alone,\nfollowed by Benjamin et al. (2007), who used Ilbert et al.\n(2006)'s improved galaxies photometric redshifts, and measured \u03c38 = 0.84 for \u03a9m = 0.24, and Fu et al (2008) who\nfound a consistent value. To clarify these discrepancies, one\nneeds to measure both the power spectrum and the M-T\nrelation normalisations \u03c38 and M\u2217 , as we discuss here.\nThe regions allowed for by different measurements on\nthe T\u2217 - \u03c38 (\u03a9m /0.24)0.6 plane are shown by Figure 8. The\nshaded region shows the constraints given by our \u03c38 and T\u2217\nmeasurements. Our best fits are shown by the thick lines.\nThe slanted black band on the figure is the 68.3% bound on\n\u22120.8\nthe \u03a90.6\nrelation from Pierpaoli et al. (2003) usm \u03c38 \u221d T \u2217\ning X-ray clusters. Its intersection with the vertical light blue\nband (APP05's T\u2217 estimation) gives the current value for\n\u03c38 favoured by X-ray cluster observations, \u03c38 \u2248 0.77 \u00b1 0.06\nfor an \u03a9m = 0.3 universe (e.g. Pierpaoli et al. 2003), which\ncorresponds to \u03c38 (\u03a9m /0.24)0.6 \u2248 0.88 \u00b1 0.05. This value\nis higher than that measured by Spergel et al. (2007) from\nCMB analyses of WMAP3 (dark blue), but lower than most\ncosmic shear analysis, like that of Hoekstra et al. (2006)\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n11\n\nPROSPECTS FOR FUTURE SURVEYS\n\nIn the following, we investigate the impact of future combined blind weak lensing and X-ray surveys on the measurement precision of the power spectrum and the masstemperature relation normalisations. We take the WMAP3\n(Spergel et al. 2007) cosmology as our fiducial model. We\nconsider two different ground based survey strategies for\nour weak gravitational lensing analysis : deep and wide surveys similar to the CFHTLS Deep and Wide surveys. We\nuse their observed weighted number density of useful background galaxies to be ng = 20 arcmin\u22122 and 9 arcmin\u22122 , respectively, distributed according to Eq. (3). We also assume\nthe intrinsic ellipticity and shape measurement error to be\n\u03c3\u03b3 = 0.3 in both cases. Following the CFHTLS scheduling,\nwe take for exposure times 40 hours per square degree for\nthe deep survey and 1 hour per square degree for the wide\nsurvey.\n6.1\n\n\u03c38 measurements\n\nWe first investigate the impact of future surveys on the\n\u03c38 measurement. Using the Press-Schechter approach described in section 4.2.2, we estimate the number of weak\nlensing detections with significance higher than 2.5, taking\ninto account shot noise and sample variance. We assume\nthat all clusters have a spherically symmetrical NFW profile. We thus neglect the effect of haloes' asphericity shown\n\n\f12\n\nJ. Berg\u00e9 et al.\n\nFigure 9. Relative errors on \u03c38 , from clusters counts in a weak\ngravitational lensing survey, as a function of survey size and integration time. All other parameters are kept constants. We assume that 1 deg2 of wide requires 1 hour of observation time,\nand 1 deg2 of deep requires 40 hours of observation time. That\nis, the lower x-axis shows area as well as the wide survey exposure time ; the upper x-axis shows the deep survey exposure\ntime. The thick solid line corresponds to a deep survey, and the\nthick dashed line to a wide survey. The flat lines show the current\nerror measurement from cosmic shear statistics (dash-dot, Hoekstra et al. 2006; Benjamin et al. 2007), and from X-ray clusters\n(dash-dot-dot, Pierpaoli et al. 2003; APP05).\n\nFigure 10. Relative errors on T\u2217 from combined weak gravitational lensing and X-ray surveys, as a function of survey size and\nintegration time. All other parameters are kept constants. The\nlower x-axis shows area as well as the wide survey exposure time;\nthe upper x-axis shows the deep survey exposure time. Solid lines\nshow the errors for a deep survey, assuming the fractional error\non weak lensing mass measurement is 20% (thick black) and 30%\n(red). Dashed lines, with the same colour indexing, show the errors for a wide survey. The current error measurement from X-ray\nclusters is shown by the flat dashed-dot-dot line (Pierpaoli et al.\n2003; APP05). We made the same assumption about the relation\nbetween survey area and observation time as in Fig. 9.\n\nby Clowe et al. (2004) : triaxial haloes oriented along the\nline of sight appear more massive than triaxial haloes of the\nsame mass, but perpendicular to the line of sight, and thus\nhave a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Clowe et al. (2004) have\nshown that this approximation does not yield any difference\nin the mass measurement dispersion. Figure 9 shows the\n68.3% relative error on \u03c38 that can be reached by counting\nweak lensing detected clusters as a function of their significance, for a deep (thick solid line) and a wide (thick dashed\nline) surveys, as a function of survey's size and observing\ntime. Because of the higher number density of clusters it\nallows one to detect, a deep survey provides errors 3 times\nlower than a wide survey of the same size. However, for a\ngiven exposure time, a wide survey provides errors 2.1 times\nlower than a deep one. That means that the gain due to\nthe coverage (and detectable clusters number) increase is\nfaster than the one due to depth increase. A larger coverage is also advantageous in that it makes sample variance\nfall down rapidly. Moreover, a wide survey detects the most\nmassive haloes, the physics of which is better understood.\nConsequently, in a survey strategy driven by exposure time,\none should prefer a wide survey. The flat dashed-dot line\nshows the current constraints provided by cosmic shear analyses (Hoekstra et al. 2006; Benjamin et al. 2007). The flat\ndashed-dot-dot line shows the current constraints from the\ncombination of X-ray M\u2217 measurement (APP05) and X-ray\ncluster counts (Pierpaoli et al. 2003).\nDetecting and counting clusters on a 10 deg2 deep survey will be competitive with current cosmic shear measure-\n\nments, whereas 20 deg2 of coverage is needed to compete\nwith current X-ray clusters measurements. Those figures\ntransform as 100 deg2 and 200 deg2 for a wide survey. That\nis, to compete with current cosmic shear surveys, one needs\n400 hours of deep survey exposure, or 100 hours of wide survey exposure. Double these times are required to compete\nwith X-ray surveys. A wide survey, less demanding in exposure time than a deep one, should then be used. Counting\nclusters on the entire planned CFHTLS Wide Survey 170\ndeg2 will provide a 6% fractional error on the \u03c38 measurement. Reaching the 1% fractional error will require a 7000\ndeg2 wide survey, or a 700 deg2 deep survey. Future surveys\n(e.g. Pan-STARRS3, LSST4 , DUNE5 ) will be able to achieve\nsuch errors.\n\n6.2\n\nT\u2217 measurements\n\nWe now turn to the precision that can be reached on T\u2217\nmeasurements by future joint surveys. What matters here\nis not cluster counts as a function of significance, but as a\nfunction of mass. As we see from figure 5, low mass clusters of galaxies cannot be seen through weak gravitational\nlensing since they do not create high enough signal-to-noise\nratios. A deep survey captures lower mass clusters than a\n3\n4\n5\n\nhttp://panstarrs.ifa.hawaii.edu\nhttp://www.lsst.org\nhttp://www.dune-mission.net\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fCombined analysis of weak lensing and X-ray blind surveys\nwide survey, but deep and wide surveys give access to the\nsame number of massive clusters. Therefore, a deep survey\nis naturally focused on the physics of galaxy groups (e.g. it\ncan probe similarity breaking at the low mass end of the\nmass-temperature relation). A wide survey gives the same\nstatistics on massive haloes, generally used to measure the\nmass-temperature relation normalisation : for this purpose,\none should then choose a wide survey. To compare the merits\nof both deep and wide survey on the T\u2217 estimation's precision, we simulate M-T relations for both types of survey. We\ntake a realistic scatter into account, \u03c3log,int = 0.051 for the\nlogarithmic M-T relation (APP05). We assume that masses\nare measured through weak gravitational lensing. We measure T\u2217 and the error on its estimate, by assuming (1) that\nour cluster sample is complete, (2) that we only make use\nof those clusters detected in our blind survey, and (3) that\nwe know the X-ray temperature of each of them. We also\ninvestigate the influence of the mass estimation fractional\nerror \u03b4M/M .\nFigure 10 shows the 68.3% error on T\u2217 that can be\nreached from a combined blind X-ray and deep (solid line) or\nwide (dashed line) weak gravitational lensing surveys, as a\nfunction of survey's size and integration time. Here again, as\nfor the error on the power spectrum normalisation, a deep\nsurvey gives errors 2.3 times lower than a wide one with\nthe same sky area coverage. On the other hand, a wide survey gives errors 2.7 times lower than a deep one with the\nsame exposure time. The dependence on area underlines the\nT\u2217 estimation's reliance on the number of useable haloes\nfor the M-T relation fitting. Figure 10 also shows the sensitivity of the T\u2217 estimation to the mass measurement errors. The black lines assume \u03b4M/M = 0.2, and the red ones\n\u03b4M/M = 0.3, which are the current fractional errors on mass\nmeasurement from weak lensing. Going from \u03b4M/M = 0.3\nto \u03b4M/M = 0.2 allows one to reduce the error on T\u2217 by\na factor of 1.3 (resp. 1.2) for a deep (resp. wide) survey of\na given sky area. The flat solid line represents the current\nerror on T\u2217 from X-ray clusters (APP05). Assuming a 20%\nerror measurement on weak lensing masses, one needs a 50\n(resp. 300) deg2 weak lensing deep (resp. wide) survey to\nreach the current error. Reaching the 1% fractional error\n(for our fiducial model with T\u2217 = 1.9) will require a 2500\ndeg2 wide survey, or a 500 deg2 deep survey. Weak lensing\nsurveys like LSST or DUNE combined with X-ray surveys\nlike eROSITA will be able to reach such a limit.\nIn a survey strategy driven by exposure time, a wide\nsurvey of 2500 deg2 (2500 hours) will be able to reach the\n1% accuracy both on \u03c38 and T\u2217 , at a much cheaper expense\nthan a deep survey. Nevertheless, a deep survey will still be\nuseful to probe high redshift regions (z > 0.8), and to study\nlow mass clusters of galaxies (M 6 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ).\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented the first shapelet analysis of weak gravitational lensing surveys. We have constructed convergence\nmaps of the CFHTLS Deep D1 field, and of 4 deg2 of the\nCFTHLS Wide W1 field, which include the D1 field. We\nhave detected six clusters of galaxies, through the lensing\nsignal they generate. Our D1 map is in good agreement with\nthat of GS07, precedently created using the KSB shear meac\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n13\n\nsurement method. We combined our weak lensing data with\nthe X-ray analysis of XMM-LSS C1 clusters lying in the\nsame region of the sky (Pacaud et al. 2007). These three\nclusters catalogue are consistent. All our shapelet detections have either an X-ray counterpart or a KSB detection.\nCounting our detections and accounting for the weak lensing\nselection function allowed us to constrain the power spectrum normalisation \u03c38 (\u03a9m /0.24)0.6 = 0.92+0.26\n\u22120.30 . The combination of lensing masses and X-ray temperatures provided\nus with a new measurement of the mass-temperature relation normalisation T\u2217 (or equivalently M\u2217 ) for clusters of\n14 \u22121\ngalaxies, M\u2217 = 2.71+0.79\nM\u2299 . Our results, though\n\u22120.61 10 h\nlimited by low statistics and sample variance, are consistent\nwith other current estimates. We also measured the slope of\nthe mass-temperature relation, and found it consistent with\nself-similarity for low mass clusters, \u03b1 = 1.60 \u00b1 0.44. We\nhave shown that one must measure both \u03c38 and T\u2217 from\ncombined weak lensing and X-ray surveys to investigate the\ndiscrepancy between independent measurements of \u03c38 from\ndifferent probes.\nWeak lensing surveys are becoming more and more effective, and are currently being optimised for best extracting\ncosmological information. Optimal surveys will allow us to\nprovide more accurate estimates of \u03c38 and T\u2217 , and to disentangle the current \u03c38 issue (Amara & Refregier 2007). We\nhave compared the merits of weak lensing deep and wide\nblind surveys, based on the CFHTLS, at estimating \u03c38 . We\nalso looked at their merits at estimating T\u2217 while combined\nwith an X-ray survey on their region of the sky. We found\nthat for experiments driven by exposure time constraints,\na wide survey will give \u2248 3 times lower errors on the estimates of both \u03c38 and T\u2217 . To secure the measurement of\n\u03c38 and M\u2217 with the current statistical accuracy, a 200 deg2\nand a 300 deg2 wide surveys will be needed respectively.\nWe finally found that a 7000 deg2 wide survey will be able\nto reach the 1% accuracy both on the power spectrum and\nmass-temperature relation normalisations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank Herv\u00e9 Aussel, Krys Libbrecht, Jean-Baptiste Melin, Yannick Mellier, Sandrine\nPires, Trevor Ponman, Jean-Luc Starck, Genevi\u00e8ve Soucail and Romain Teyssier for useful discussions, and Cathy\nHorellou for comments on the first version of the paper.\n\nREFERENCES\nAmara A., Refregier A., 2007, MNRAS, 381, 1018\nArnaud M., Aghanim N., Neumann D.M., 2002, A&A, 389,\n1\nArnaud M., Pointecouteau E., Pratt G.W., 2005, A&A,\n441, 893 (APP05)\nBacon D., Refregier A., Ellis R., 2000, MNRAS, 318, 625\nBacon D., Massey R., Refregier A., Ellis R., 2003, MNRAS,\n344,673\nBardeau S., Soucail G., Kneib J.P., Czoske O., Ebeling H.,\nHudelot P., Smail I., Smith G.P., , 2007, A&A, 470, 449\nBartelmann M., Schneider P., 2001, Phys.
