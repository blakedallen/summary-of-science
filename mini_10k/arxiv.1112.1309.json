A second widely studied system is derived from the previous one\nwhen an oscillating field perpendicular to the static one is added. This is the configuration\nused in typical magnetic resonance (MR) experiments, and for this reason, it has been\nextensively studied. In MR setups, however, the transverse field oscillates at a frequency\nnear-resonant to the Larmor frequency set by the static field, and has usually an amplitude\nmuch smaller than the static one. The resonant condition greatly facilitates the task of\nmodeling the system: the oscillating field is seen as a superposition of two counter-rotating\n(and usually weak) fields, one of which appears to be (quasi-) static in a reference frame\nwhich rotates at the Larmor frequency around the static field, while the other has negligible\neffects. This is well-known in textbooks as the rotating wave approximation (RWA).\nIn this work we study the system described above, but in conditions which make the\nRWA unsuitable. In particular, we consider the cases in which the transverse field has a\ngeneral periodic time dependence containing Fourier components at frequencies much larger\nthan the Larmor frequency. In fact, we re-examine, extend, and generalize the results\nreported decades ago by S.Haroche and co-workers [1], where similarly an analytical model\nhas been developed and applied to interpret experimental data from optical detection of\natomic precession.\nThe results presented here are modeled with the Larmor equation and discussed using a\nperturbative approach based on the Magnus expansion of the time-development operator.\nCompared to previous works on this subject, our approach makes it easy to model the effects\nof a transverse field oscillating with an arbitrary waveform.\nIt seems worth stressing that the subject has implications for the research area of dynamic\nlocalization [2, 3], which concerns the effect of a time-periodic field on quantum systems such\nas charged particles in crystals [4] and Bose Einstein condensates [5].\nThe experimental implementation is feasible, provided that a slow precession occurs\naround a weak static field, for instance with ultra-low-field NMR setups and in atomic\nspin precession experiments. This latter is the nature of the setup used in our case, and the\nreported experimental results concern measurements performed with an optical-pumping\natomic magnetometer operated at a \u03bcT static field range. The corresponding Larmor fre2\n\n\fquency is in the kHz range, making it easy to apply a homogeneous transverse field oscillating\nat much higher frequencies, even with a much larger amplitude.\nOur apparatus detects the time-dependent Faraday rotation of the polarization plane\nof a weak probe laser beam, which is directly related to a component of the macroscopic\nmagnetization of atoms. The analyzed magnetization component is the one parallel to the\ndirection of the oscillating field, which coincides with the probe beam propagation axis. In\nthe presence of a strong transverse oscillating field the three components of the magnetization\nevolve in time with a complex behaviour, which is far from a simple precession. Nevertheless\nthe measured component maintains its similarity to the simple precession behaviour. In\nother terms, the motion around the direction (z) of the static field is deeply affected by\na strong non-resonantly oscillating field along x, which mainly modifies the dynamics of\nthe magnetization components My and Mz , but leaves Mx evolving (approximately) with\na simple harmonic law. This quasi-harmonic evolution of Mx makes it possible to define\na modified (dressed) Larmor frequency even when the oscillating field is so strong that no\nprecession motion could be recognized by simply observing the time evolution of the whole\nM vector.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section II we describe the experimental setup used,\nin Section III we discuss the theoretical model, and Section IV contains the discussion and\nthe conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nThe basic structure of the experimental setup is that of an optical atomic magnetometer\n(see Fig. 1). Using a resonant circularly polarized laser light, alkali atoms are pumped\nin a specific Zeeman sublevel and thus the medium is magnetized along the wave-vector\n(x) direction. The atomic medium is placed in a homogeneous magnetic field (z direction)\ntransverse to the pump light propagation. Consequently the Zeeman sublevel where atoms\nare pumped evolves in time, giving rise to the magnetization precession in the xy plane,\naround the static magnetic field.\nThis precession is detected by analyzing the Faraday rotation of a weak, linearly polarized, probe beam which propagates in the xy plane (in our case it is collinear to the\npump beam). The linear probe beam polarization can be decomposed in two \u03c3 + and \u03c3 \u2212\n3\n\n\fcounter-rotating circularly polarized components, which experience variation of the respective refractive indexes due to the atomic spin precession. These two circular components\nrecombine with a time-dependent relative dephasing in a linear polarization rotated by an\nangle oscillating at the Larmor frequency. Beside the different dispersions, the \u03c3 + and \u03c3 \u2212\ncomponents suffer also different absorptions, but this aspect is made of little relevance by\ntuning the probe laser away from the resonance center.\nTo contrast the relaxation processes that cause a progressive decay of the induced magnetization, and hence of the detected signal, the pump light is applied periodically, synchronously with the precession of the atomic spins, i.e. resonantly with the Larmor frequency\nset by the static magnetic field.\nIn our setup, the pump radiation is generated by a single-mode, distributed feedback,\npigtailed DFB diode laser, whose optical frequency is controlled through the junction current\nand is periodically made resonant (or non resonant) to the D1 transition of Cs, at 894 nm.\nIt illuminates the atomic sample at an intensity of about 0.5 mW/cm2 . The probe radiation\nis generated by a single-mode, Fabry-Perot, pig-tailed diode laser resonant with the D2 line\nof Cs, at 852 nm. It illuminates the sample at much weaker intensity, being attenuated at\na level of about half \u03bcW/cm2 , in order to negligibly perturb the sample.\nPolarization maintaining (PM) fibres bring the radiation of the two lasers to a coupler\n(via an on-fibre attenuator in the case of the probe) which mixes them in the PM fibre illuminating the sample. In proximity of the atomic sample, the two radiations emerging from\nthe fibre end are collimated by a lens, their linear polarization is reinforced by a polarizing\ncube.Then, a phase-plate acts differently on the polarization of both the radiations, rendering the pump radiation circular, while leaving the probe one linear. This double effect is\nachieved thanks to a multi-order wave plate made of a 480\u03bcm quartz layer, which introduces\n[6] for the crossed linear polarization components of the two wavelengths a (5+1/4)\u03bbD1 and\na 5\u03bbD2 relative delays, respectively. Such method of tailored multi-order waveplate method\nis quite similar to that applied in the magnetometric setup (based on Rb vapors) described\nin [7].\nAfter interacting with the atomic sample, the pump radiation is blocked by an interferential filter and the probe beam polarization is analyzed by a balanced polarimeter made\nof a 45o oriented Rochon and a couple of photodetectors whose photocurrent difference is\namplified by a low-noise transimpedance amplifier.\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Schematics of the experimental setup. The probe laser is tuned to the D2-Cs line\n@852nm and unmodulated; the pump laser is tuned to the D1-Cs line @894nm and is modulated\nsynchronously with the atomic precession. Both are mixed and coupled to the sensor though\npolarization maintaining fibres (pmf). The probe is attenuated down to \u03bcW level before the Cs\ncell, the pump is stopped by an interferential filter (Int fltr) after the cell. A multi-order waveplate\nrenders the pump polarization circular, while leaving the probe polarization linear. The Cs cell\ncontains 23 Torr of N2 as a buffer gas, which quenches the fluorescence and slows down the Cs\natom motion, making it diffusive. The cell is slightly heated to increase Cs vapour density. The\ntransmitted probe laser polarization is analyzed by a balanced polarimeter made of a Rochon\npolarizer oriented at 45o with respect to the probe polarization axis and two photodiodes. A\ndifferential transimpedance amplifier converts the photocurrent to a voltage signal, which is then\ndigitally acquired. That signal reproduces the Faraday rotation, associated to the time-dependent\norientation of the precessing atomic spins.\n\n5\n\n\fThe polarimetric signal is either analyzed as a function of the laser-modulation frequency\nto characterize the atomic magnetic resonance, or used to generate a signal for driving the\nlaser optical frequency, thus closing a loop which makes the system a self-oscillator. In the\nfirst case, the precession frequency is estimated with a best fit procedure, while in the second\ncase it is evaluated as the self-oscillation frequency, provided that the loop delay is properly\ncompensated. In practice, the closed-loop, self-oscillating operation helps in shortening the\nmeasurement time, but may introduce systematic errors due to inappropriate choice of the\nloop delay. On the contrary, operating in the open loop/scanned frequency/best fit procedure\nrequires a longer time but improves the accuracy in the Larmor frequency determination.\nAll the plots reported in Sec. IV were obtained in this more accurate open-loop operation\nmode. With the used static field intensities, the precession frequency ranges from hundreds\nof Hz to several kHz.\nThe atomic sample is made of a high quality gas-buffered cell containing a droplet of Cs\nand 23 Torr of N2 . The buffer gas is suitable for slowing down the thermal motion of Cs\natoms, making it diffusive and also quenches any stray fluorescence light. Following several\noptimization campaigns devoted to improve the sensitivity of the setup in magnetometric\napplications, the pump laser is made resonant (at the right time) with the |1 S1/2 , Fg = 4i \u2192\n|1 P1/2 i hyperfine components of the D1 line, while the analyzed ground state is the Fg = 4\nand the detection is made tuning the probe laser about 2 GHz on the blue wing of the line\nmade of the triplet |1 S1/2 , Fg = 4i \u2192 |2 P3/2 i. The pump radiation is broadly modulated with\na slightly asymmetric signal, so that, besides the synchronous excitation of the |1 S1/2 , Fg = 4i\nlevel, it also spends some time in resonance with the |1 S1/2 , Fg = 3i \u2192 |2 P3/2 i triplet.\nThe Cs cell is inserted in an anti-inductive heating coil by which the temperature is\nincreased up to about 50o C in order to reach a good compromise for having a large signal\n(an optimal optical depth) without introducing an excessive broadening due to the increase\nof spin-exchange collision rate. A second coaxial, inductive coil makes it possible to apply\na homogeneous time dependent transverse field which is thus parallel to the optical axis.\nThis second coil is supplied by a digital waveform generator which provides an arbitrary\nperiodic voltage signal. This signal is designed to produce current (and hence x-oriented\nmagnetic field) Fourier components with appropriate phases and amplitudes, in accordance\nto the measured complex impedance of the coil.\nThe whole experiment is conducted in a magnetically clean volume, where a set of three\n6\n\n\fmutually perpendicular, large size Helmholtz coils and a set of quadrupoles make it possible\nto control the three components of the magnetic field and reduce their inhomogeneities. In\nparticular, the horizontal components (x, y) of the Earth field are fully compensated while\nthe vertical one (z), partially compensated down to a few \u03bcT, determines the static field.\nThe system is here used for an absolute frequency measurement. Nevertheless, the apparatus is designed to perform differential measurements as well. In fact, the fibre coupler\nis a 2 \u00d7 2 50% device, meaning that the two radiations are mixed in equal ratios and made\navailable in two output PM fibres. Thus, the apparatus can easily be adapted to work with\na dual sensor, suitable for gradiometry and for differential magnetic measurements. The accuracy in the absolute frequency measurement (order of 1 Hz) is largely in excess compared\nto the needs of this work, and is limited by the environmental magnetic noise.\n\nIII.\n\nMODEL\n\nThe aim of this section is to describe and characterize the precession of spins in the\npresence of a time dependent magnetic field orthogonally oriented with respect to the static\none, using a special form of the perturbation theory for the time evolution operator.\nAs stated above, taking the z axis in the direction of the static field and the x axis along\nthe alternating one, i.e. B = (Bx \u03c6(\u03c9t), 0, Bz ), the Larmor equations for the magnetization\nare\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u1e40x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u1e40y\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u1e40\nz\n\n= \u2212\u03a9z My\n= \u03a9z Mx \u2212 \u03a9x \u03c6(\u03c9t) Mz\n\n(1)\n\n= \u03a9x \u03c6(\u03c9t) My\n\nHere \u03a9x,z = \u03b3Bx,z (\u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio) and \u03c6(\u03c9t) is a real and periodic function\nwith a well-behaved Fourier expansion.

Notice\nhow the coefficients Gn , n 6= 0 are encoded in the c parameter.\n\nB.\n\nPure sinusoidal signal\n\nThis case has already been studied and reported in literature. S. Haroche et al., in\na pioneer paper had already demonstrated the possibility of solving the simple case of a\nharmonic transverse field [1] with a different approach based on quantum mechanics. In\nthat study, the authors quantized the oscillating field as a bosonic mode (rf photons) and\nused standard first-order perturbation theory to evaluate the energy shifts. Then, in the\n(semi-classical) limit of a large boson number, they obtained the same result reported here\nbelow. That method would run into difficulties for generic time-periodic signals. On the\nother hand, let us examine how quickly the results are obtained using our approach. Starting\nfrom \u03c6(\u03c4 ) = cos \u03c4 we easily get \u03a6(\u03c4 ) = \u03be sin \u03c4 and the coefficients Gn are the Bessel functions\n[9]\nGn = |Jn (\u03be)| ei\u03b8n\n\n(27)\n\nbeing the phases \u03b8n either 0 or \u03c0 according to the sign of Jn . We thus re-obtain the Haroche\net al. result\n\u03a9L = \u03a9z |J0 (\u03be)| .\n\n(28)\n\nNotice that in case of a general harmonic signal \u03c6(\u03c4 ) = cos(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ) one has\n\u03a6(\u03c4 ) = \u03be [sin(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ) + sin \u03c40 ]\n\n(29)\n\nGn = ei \u03be sin \u03c40 |Jn (\u03be)| ei(\u03b8n \u2212n\u03c40 )\n\n(30)\n\nand thus\n\ngiving for |G0 | the same result as before.\n\n11\n\n\fC.\n\nNon-harmonic signals\n\nHaving found the general expression (22) for the dressed Larmor frequency, we can study\nmore complicated cases. Let's first introduce a higher harmonic component in the signal,\nindicating with r the ratio between its amplitude and the fundamental one i.e.\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) = cos \u03c4 + r cos(k\u03c4 + \u03c6)\n\n(31)\n\nh\ni\nr\n\u03a6(\u03c4 ) = \u03be sin \u03c4 + (sin(k\u03c4 + \u03c6) \u2212 sin \u03c6) .\nk\n\n(32)\n\nwhich gives\n\nRepeating the same steps as before, one gets\n\u2212i (\u03ber/k) sin \u03c6\n\nGn = e\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nJn\u2212kp (\u03be) Jp (\u03be r/k) ei p \u03c6\n\n(33)\n\np=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich is a generalized Bessel function [10]. Thus the leading contribution (eq. (22) ) of the\nLarmor frequency becomes\n+\u221e\nX\n\u03a9L\nJ\u2212kp (\u03be) Jp (\u03be r/k) ei p \u03c6 .\n= F (\u03be, r, k, \u03c6) \u2261\n\u03a9z\np=\u2212\u221e\n\n(34)\n\nAnother highly non-harmonic signal which gives analytical results is the square wave\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c4\n0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 2\u03c0\u03b1\n\u03a6(\u03c4 ) = \u03be\n.\n(35)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u03b1(2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c4 )/(1 \u2212 \u03b1) 2\u03c0\u03b1 < \u03c4 < 2\u03c0\n\nIn fact in this case the integration outlined in eq. (20) can be done trivially obtaining\nG0 = ei\u03c0\u03be\u03b1\n\nsin(\u03c0\u03be\u03b1)\n,\n\u03c0\u03be\u03b1\n\n(36)\n\nand thus the dressed Larmor frequency results\n| sin \u03c0\u03be\u03b1|\n\u03a9L\n=\n.\n\u03a9z\n\u03c0\u03be\u03b1\n\n(37)\n\nFor general periodic signals the Gn coefficients can be obtained analytically as multiple\nsums of products of ordinary Bessel functions. However, this approach soon becomes cumbersome and a numerical evaluation of the Gn , using for instance the Fast Fourier Transform,\nis a viable alternative.\n12\n\n\fIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe main issue of the paper is to study the effect of an alternating, non-resonant magnetic\nfield oriented perpendicularly to the static one causing a reduction of the precession rate of\nspins. Such a reduction has a non-monotone dependence on the amplitude of the alternating\nfield, and, under specific conditions, the precession frequency can take a zero value. This\nphenomenon has been previously observed and theoretically interpreted in the case of a\nharmonic signal [1].\nThe model introduced in this work is suitable to the description of the simple case of a\nharmonically oscillating field but also makes it possible to easily extend the analysis to the\nnon-harmonic case.\nThe comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental results is made taking into\naccount several operating conditions and varying different parameters. We preliminarily\ntest the consistency with known results obtained in the simple case of a transverse field\noscillating with a harmonic law. Then we test the strongly non-harmonic case of a squarewave field. A more detailed analysis is presented for the case of a two-Fourier-component\nfield, where we analyse the effect as a function of the amplitudes and of the relative phase of\nthe two components. We also devote attention to the cases when the frequency ratio is even\n(k = 2) or odd (k = 3), pointing out the symmetries discussed in the appendix A. Finally\nwe demonstrate the existence of a linear response to a weak dc field, which has implications\nin the design of atomic magnetometers with vectorial response.\nWe show in Fig. 2 the comparison of experimental data obtained with the apparatus\ndescribed in Sec. II and the curve (namely |J0 |) given by the model in the case of a harmonic\nfield. In this figure (as in the following ones) the amplitude of the oscillating field is expressed\nin terms of the dimensionless quantity \u03be defined (see also Sec. III eq. (3)) by \u03be = \u03a9x /\u03c9 =\n\u03b3Bx /\u03c9. The frequency reduction effect is also given in natural dimensionless units, reporting\nthe ratio between the dressed and the unperturbed precession frequencies. It is worth\nnoticing that if the same curves are plotted in terms absolute quantities (i.e. plotting\nthe dressed precession frequency as a function of Bx ), passing from a spinning species to\nanother having a larger gyromagnetic factor, the vertical axis scales up while the horizontal\none scales down. This makes it possible to identify conditions for matching the dressed\nprecession frequencies of different species, which is of great interest for possible applications,\n13\n\n\fsee for example [11] and references therein.\n1.0\ntheoretical\nexperimental \u03a9z = 2\u03c0 6303 Hz\n\n\u03a9L/\u03a9z\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 2:\n\nRatio between the dressed and unperturbed precession frequency as a function of the\n\namplitude of the oscillating field (expressed in the dimensionless quantity \u03be = \u03b3Bx /\u03c9) in the case\nof a harmonic transverse field, according to eq. (28) the plot reproduces the behaviour of |J0 (\u03be)|.\n\nAs a first example of a non-harmonic modulation, we consider the case of a symmetric\n(50% duty cycle) square wave. In this case the model predicts a behaviour given by a sinc\nmodulus (eq. (35)). The prediction is in good agreement with the experimental observation,\nas appears evident in Fig. 3.\nSquare wave signal\n1\n\n\u03a9L/\u03a9z\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of theoretical predictions (line) and experimental points for the ratio between\nthe dressed and unperturbed precession frequency as a function of the amplitude of a square-wave\nlike oscillating field.

In this\ncase the prediction (see eq. (34)) can be easily compared to the experimental results when\nvarying one of the independent variables, as in the following.

The scalar nature of our magnetometer makes it\nvery sensitive to variations of the field component parallel to the static one (z component),\nwhile the transverse components can be detected and minimized with procedures responding\n18\n\n\fto the second order in \u03be0 . In contrast, repeated measurements and equalization of w0 and\nw\u03c0 constitute an effective procedure with a first order response in \u03be0 (see eq.

In this perspective, an even-k modulation technique\nmay be proposed to achieve a vector response of this type of scalar sensors.\nIt is also worth nothing that this asymmetry cannot be seen if the modulation is purely\nharmonic (see Appendix B for details), at least in the perturbation order considered in the\ndescribed model.\n0.40\n\nexperimental\n2 order\n\n\u03a9L/\u03a9z\n\n0.35\n\n1 order\n\n0.30\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\u03c0/4\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n3\u03c0/4\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c6\n\n5\u03c0/4\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n7\u03c0/4\n\n2\u03c0\n\n5\u03c0/4 3\u03c0/2 7\u03c0/4\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0.020\n0.015\n\n\u2206 \u03a9L/\u03a9z\n\n0.010\n0.005\n0.000\n\u221d\u03be20\n\u221d\u03be0\n\n\u22120.005\n\n\u221d\u03b62\n\n\u22120.010\n\u22120.015\n0\n\n\u03c0/4\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n3\u03c0/4\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c6\n\nFigure 8: (Upper) Comparison of theoretical predictions (line) and experimental points in presence\n(dc)\n\nof a small dc field superimposed to the ac one.

The proposed model is suitable for the\ninterpretation of the effect of a non-harmonically oscillating transverse field. In fact, the\nnonlinear nature of the system's response makes a harmonic expansion unfeasible and makes\npreviously proposed analyses (considering only the harmonic transverse case) unsuitable for\ndescribing the general case of an arbitrary time-dependence of the transverse magnetic field.\nWe have tested our model experimentally, studying in detail the case of a non-harmonic\ntransverse field constituted by two Fourier components. The relevance of the relative phase\nof the two components in the determination of the observed dressed Larmor frequency was\npointed out. We also demonstrated that the non-harmonicity of the alternating field gives\nrise to a first-order variation of the dressed Larmor frequency with respect to a small dc\nfield superimposed to the alternating one. This observation is of interest for its potential in\ndesigning atomic magnetometers with vectorial response.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Patricia H.

For even k it is easily seen that\n\u03c1k,2n+1 \u2261 0 reducing the \u03c6 period in (A1) from 2\u03c0 to \u03c0. This feature is clearly visible in the\nFig. 7.\n\nAppendix B: Asymmetry details\n\nLet's consider the second order corrections to \u03a9L which give rise to the asymmetry. As\ncan be seen from eq. (26) one needs to investigate the series (24), which can be rewritten as\na=\n\n+\u221e\nX\nG\u2217 (Gn \u2212 G\u2212n )\n0\n\nb=\n\nn\n\nn=1\n\n+\u221e\nX\n|Gn |2 \u2212 |G\u2212n |2\nn=1\n\nn\n\n.\n\n(B1)\n\nThen let's evaluate these expressions for the case of a general harmonic field as in eq. (29).\nNotice that in real experimental situations the presence of the time lag \u03c40 is unavoidable.\nThus we assume that \u03c40 is a random parameter uniformly distributed and at the end of the\ncalculations all the quantities must be averaged.\nUsing eq. (30) and the property J\u2212n = (\u22121)n Jn of Bessel functions one arrives at\nRe(a) = 2\n\n+\u221e\nX\nJ0 (\u03be)J2n+1(\u03be)\nn=0\n\n2n + 1\n\nwhose average\n1\nRe(a) \u2261\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ncos(2n + 1)\u03c40\n\nb\u22610\n\n(B2)\n\n2\u03c0\n\nRe(a) d\u03c40\n\n(B3)\n\n0\n\ngives zero. We can thus conclude that a purely harmonic signal cannot give an asymmetric\ncontribution.\nThe non-harmonic case (see eq. (31)) on the contrary shows the asymmetry. In fact let\nthe general non-harmonic signal be\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) = cos(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ) + r cos(k(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ) + \u03c6),\n\n(B4)\n\nusing the same device of eq. (33) we can write\nGn (\u03c40 ) = ei \u03be (sin \u03c40 +(r/k) sin(k\u03c40 \u2212\u03c6)+(r/k) sin \u03c6) e\u2212i n \u03c40 Gn\n21\n\n(B5)\n\n\fwhere the Gn on the right-hand side can be read from eq. (33). From this result easily\nfollows that\n|Gn (\u03c40 )|2 = |Gn |2\n\n(B6)\n\nshowing that the leading contribution to the Larmor frequency is unaffected by an overall\nphase. Moreover G\u2212n cannot be simply related to Gn (as in Bessel functions case), thus the\nb parameter in (B1) generally is non-zero. For the other series after some algebra one finds\nRe(a) =\n\n+\u221e \u001a\nX\nRe [G\u2217 (Gn \u2212 G\u2212n )]\n\nIm [G\u22170 (Gn \u2212 G\u2212n )]\ncos n\u03c40 \u2212\nsin n\u03c40\nn\n\n0\n\nn\n\nn=1\n\n\u001b\n\n(B7)\n\nwhose average is zero.\n\n[1] S.
