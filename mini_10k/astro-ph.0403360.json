We\nfurther note that the peak luminosity ratio between quiescent episodes is not in\nagreement with the ratio predicated by the lag vs. peak luminosity relationship.\nWe briefly discuss these observations in terms of current collapsar jet models.\nSubject headings: gamma rays: bursts-methods: data analysis\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is strong evidence that the majority of gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses result\nfrom internal shocks in relativistic winds (Sari & Piran 1997a; Kobayashi, Piran, & Sari\n1997; Daigne & Mochkovitch 1998; Ramirez-Ruiz & Fenimore 2000; Nakar & Piran 2002).\nHowever, a number of bursts exhibit a soft component indicative of external shocks that\ncould be interpreted as onset of afterglow (Giblin et al. 1999; Burenin et al. 1999; Giblin et\nal. 2002). This emission begins preferentially towards the end of the burst or even after the\nGRB has ended (as suggested by the BeppoSAX WFC and NFI observations of serveral x-ray\nafterglows (Costa 2000)), but can also appear at a time early enough to overlap the shorttimescale emission (as observed in GRB 980923 (Giblin et al. 1999)). In addition, extended\nsoft \u03b3\u2212ray emission has been observed by co-adding the fluxes of many BATSE bursts; this\nmight also be an indicator of the same external shock phenomenon (Connaughton 2002).\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\"Quiescent\" GRBs may provide new clues to the origins and physics of GRB shocks.\nQuiescent bursts are GRBs that release their gamma-ray energy in more than one distinct\nemission episode (Ramirez-Ruiz & Merloni 2001; Ramirez-Ruiz, Merloni, & Rees 2001);\ne.g. they have at least one extended period during which emission is absent. A rigorous\ndefinition of quiescent time can be problematic due to the diverse nature or complexity of\nGRB temporal structures.\nRamirez-Ruiz & Merloni (2001) introduced a quiescent GRB definition for a sample\nof bright BATSE bursts that used a sliding temporal window with a width of 0.05 \u00d7 T90\non summed, background-subtracted, BATSE 4-channel 64-ms data. These authors chose\nGRBs which had at least one time period for which the count rate dropped below 2\u03c3 of the\nsummed background rate. This criterion was applied to only the brightest, longest bursts in\nthe BATSE 4B Catalog (Paciesas et al. 1999).\nIt is possible that this definition is too permissive, since it might allow for inclusion of\nsome GRBs that do not have distinct emission episodes. For example, some bright bursts\nthat do not satisfy this criterion (because the first episode's decay and the second episode's\nrise overlap) might be classified as quiescent if they are observed at lower signal-to-noise,\nas might some bursts with faint, long, underlying pulses. Because the existing quiescent\ndefinition might be too permissive, we have tentatively further required quiescent GRBs to\nbe those in which the emission drops to the background for an extended period of time that\nis greater than or equal to the duration of the previous emission episode. This ensures that\nthe quiescent time is greater than the interpulse duration.\nIn their study of very bright quiescent GRBs, Ramirez-Ruiz & Merloni (2001) operated\nunder the assumption that the post-quiescent episodes are due to internal shocks. We offer\nthe hypothesis that quiescent GRBs potentially provide a laboratory in which external shock\nsignatures indicative of the onset of afterglow may be isolated from the rest of the burst. We\nhave thus far found two GRBS that support this hypothesis.\n\n2.\n\nAnalysis\n\nGRB 960530 and GRB 980125 are bursts from the BATSE 5B catalog that deviate\nsignificantly from what is considered to be standard GRB behavior. Neither burst was\nobserved by Bepposax, and the RXTE PCA was unable to localize GRB 980125.\nThe BATSE 4-channel time histories of GRB 960530 and GRB 980125 are illustrated in\nfigure 1 and figure 2. We have measured quiescent and emission episodic durations for these\nGRBs via the summed four-channel sliding temporal window technique of Ramirez-Ruiz &\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nMerloni (2001). As shown below, the localization measurements verify that the multiple\nemission episodes are indeed associated with the same sources for both GRB 960530 and\nGRB 980125.\nGRB 960530 (BATSE trigger 5478) has two distinct emission episodes separated by\n233 s. Episode (a) is a single-pulse FRED (Fast Rise Exponential Decay) of duration 23 s.\nEpisode (b) is a smooth single-pulse episode of 37 s. The BATSE locations of these episodes\nare consistent with the same source; episode (a) is located at RA = 143.0\u25e6 and Dec = \u221253.8\u25e6\nwith error \u00b11.4\u25e6 , while episode (b) is located at RA = 143.0\u25e6 and Dec = \u221253.0\u25e6 with error\n\u00b11.9\u25e6 .\nGRB 980125 (BATSE trigger 6581) has two distinct emission episodes with a faint\npreburst episode. The preburst episode is faint and lasts 13 s. It is followed by a short\nquiescent period of 18 s. Although the preburst episode satisfies our rigorous definition of a\ndistinct emission episode, we have chosen not to include it in our analysis because it is too\nfaint for its properties to be accurately measured. Complex emission episode (a) follows and\nlasts 31 s. Episode (b) is a smooth episode with two distinct pulses and a duration of roughly\n45 s, it is preceded by a quiescent period of 161 s. The first of these two distinct pulses is\na smooth broad pulse similar in temporal structure to GRB 960530's emission episode (b),\nwhile the second pulse (which overlaps the first) is more indicative of a standard FRED.\nThe BATSE locations of these episodes are also consistent with the same source; the faint\npreburst pulse is located at RA = 344.2\u25e6 and Dec = 41.0\u25e6 with an error of \u00b13.8\u25e6 , emission\nepisode (a) is located at RA = 350.6\u25e6 and Dec = 35.1\u25e6 with an error of \u00b10.5\u25e6 , and emission\nepisode (b) is located at RA = 354.6\u25e6 and Dec = 34.8\u25e6 with error \u00b11.4\u25e6 .\nWe demonstrate that the smooth quiescent pulses have other peculiar properties in\naddition to their peculiar temporal properties. To study these quiescent GRBs in more\ndetail, we apply three techniques: (1) spectral lags, (2) Color-Color Diagrams (CCDs), and\n(3) the Internal Luminosity Function (ILF).\n\n2.1.\n\nSpectral Lags\n\nSpectral lags are energy-dependent delays in the GRB temporal structure. In general,\nsoft pulses lag behind hard pulses. Pulses also appear to broaden at softer energies as\nE \u22120.4 (Norris et al. 1996). Spectral lags apparently correlate with burst parameters such as\nbeaming angles and peak luminosities (as measured on the 256 ms timescale) (Norris 2002).\nSpectral lags are defined as the maximum value of the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF)\nof two energy channels (Band 1997). Poisson background variations in the time histories\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ncomplicate the identification of the CCF peak, so prior studies have modeled the CCF with\na fitting function to identify the lag. CCFs are typically asymmetric because GRBs generally\nhave longer decay times than rise times. A cubic fitting function has been found to be a more\naccurate characterization of CCF lags (Norris, Marani, & Bonnell 2000) than a quadratic\nfunction (Wu & Fenimore 2000).\nRather than use a cubic or quadratic fitting function, we have instead chosen to use the\npulse model of Norris et al. (1996). This function is a more natural choice than the cubic or\nquadratic since the CCF describes a normalized comparison between episodes whose primary\nstructures are pulses; it thus accounts for the CCF time-asymmetry in a natural way.\nApplication of the CCF to the different emission components of GRB 960530 and GRB\n980125 leads to intriguing results. The smooth pulse appearing after the quiescent period\nin GRB 960530 has a significantly longer lag (in all energy channel combinations) than the\nfirst FRED pulse. The lags are shown in table 1. The results are similar and are shown in\ntable 2) for GRB 980125: the smooth pulse in emission episode (b) has a broader CCF and\na significantly longer lag than that found during the rest of the burst. It should be noted\nthat the lag of emission episode (a) is consistent with the lag of the second (FRED) pulse\nfound in emission episode (b).\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Internal Luminosity Function\n\nThe Internal Luminosity Function (ILF) \u03c8(L) is the distribution of luminosity within a\nGRB; \u03c8(L)\u2206L represents the fraction of time during which a burst's luminosity lies between\nL and L + \u2206L (Horack & Hakkila 1997; Hakkila et al. 2004). For the purposes of this\nmanuscript, we discuss the ILF calculated in the 50 to 300 keV energy range using fourchannel 64-ms data. The ILF is normalized to the number of Poisson background-subtracted\ntime intervals during which emission is observed 2\u03c3 or more above the background and by\nthe requirement that \u03a3\u03c8(L)\u2206L = 1. It is best fit with a quasi power-law form for most\nbursts such that\n2\n\u03c8(L) \u221d L\u03b1 \u00d7 10\u03b2\u00d7[log L] .\n(1)\nWe refer to \u03b1 as the power-law index and \u03b2 as the curvature index. The variables \u03b1 and \u03b2\nappear to be indicators of burst temporal morphology (they are highly-correlated such that\nGRBs with large \u03b1 also have large \u03b2 while GRBs with small \u03b1 also have small \u03b2); smooth,\nFRED-like bursts typically have large \u03b1 (roughly \u22122 \u2264 \u03b1 < 3) while spiky (narrow-pulsed)\nbursts typically have small \u03b1 (approximately \u22127 \u2264 \u03b1 < \u22122).\nWe have measured the ILF for the different components of quiescent GRBs 960530 and\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n980125; these are indicated in table 1 and table 2. We note that the late-appearing, smooth,\nlong-lag components of both bursts are fit by noticeably steeper ILF values than are the\nother episodes. The ILF values of these smooth pulses thus indicate a different morphology\nthan that normally associated with FREDs. The ILF thus supports the hypothesis that the\nsmooth broad pulses are different in nature than the pulses found elsewhere in these two\nquiescent GRBs.\nThe second (FRED) pulse in emission episode (b) (at time t=255 s) of GRB 980125 is\nsomewhat peculiar. It is smoother than a typical FRED and has a correspondingly steep\nvalue of \u03b1, but it has a short lag consistent with the burst's emission episode (a). It is\npossible that overlap with the broad, long-lag pulse has affected its ILF measurement.\n\n2.3.\n\nColor-Color Diagrams\n\nColor-color diagrams (CCDs) (Giblin 2000) can be used to describe GRB spectral evolution. Several colors can be created from BATSE four-channel data; Giblin (2000) defines the\nhard color index HC = F 3/F 2 where F3 is the BATSE channel 3 photon flux in units of photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 and F2 is the BATSE channel 2 photon flux. The soft color index SC is defined\nsimilarly as SC = F 2/F 1 where F1 is the BATSE channel 1 photon flux. The timescales\nover which these color indices are measured vary in order to maintain a roughly constant\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The BATSE color indices in general have large enough signal-to-noise\nratios for reliable spectral evolution studies. Given the detector response, the observed colors of cooling external shocks have been predicted by Giblin (2000). With this information,\nCCDs can be used to search GRBs for signatures of external shocks. Having ascertained\nthat the temporal and temporally-shifted spectral structures of the broad pulses are different\nthan those of typical GRB pulses, we now explore the spectral evolution of these pulses using\nCCDs.\nGRBs typically undergo hard to soft spectral evolution. Thus, the terminal GRB emission tends to be softer than the initial emission. This general spectral evolution can be\nobserved in a CCD.\nAlthough the emission appearing towards the end of GRBs tends to be soft, not all\nterminal emission exhibits the colors predicted by the external shock model. Theoretical\nsynchrotron cooling models are predicted to occupy a fairly narrow range of hard vs. soft\ncolors. Both the fast cooling and slow cooling models are predicted to have their color indices\nevolve in the regimes 0.6 \u2264 SC \u2264 1.0 and 0.7 \u2264 HC \u2264 1.1 (Giblin 2000; Giblin et al. 2002).\nGRB 960530 has previously been considered to be an afterglow candidate because it\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nexhibits a soft gamma-ray component that was coincident with the onset of the afterglow\nphase (Giblin et al. 2002). The CCD of this soft gamma-ray component was additionally\nin agreement with the theoretical prediction for synchrotron cooling. It is difficult to firmly\nestablish the connection between the CCD of late emission from GRB 980125 and the synchrotron shock model, but figure 3 indicates that this late emission is consistent with both\nfast- (solid line), and slow-cooling (dashed line) synchrotron models. Furthermore, the second episode is in better agreement with synchrotron afterglow emission than the first episode\n(Freismuth, Giblin, & Hakkila 2003).\nThe concluding time periods of GRB 960530 and GRB 980125 thus both exhibit spectral\nbehavior that evolves from hard to soft (such as is typically found in GRBs). However, this\nbehavior is also consistent with a particular spectral evolution expected from external shocks\ninitiating an afterglow.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe late, long-lag pulses of quiescent GRBs 960530 and 980125 have different temporal\nand spectral characteristics than those found earlier in the bursts. More notably, the properties are also different than those generally observed in GRBs. These properties indicate a\nseparate pulse component which has been conveniently isolated from the standard emission\nin these two GRBs by the quiescent interval.\n\n3.1.\n\nAre the Long-Lag Components Internal or External Shocks?\n\nDespite the evidence linking GRB pulses to internal shocks, the long-lag pulses of GRBs\n960530 and 980125 appear to be inconsistent with internal shocks. As can be seen in figure 1\nand figure 2, the long-lag pulses appearing late in the bursts are broader than the short-lag\npulses appearing early in the bursts, as expected from external shock models (Fenimore,\nMadras, & Nayakshin 1996; Sari & Piran 1997b; Fenimore et al. 1999; Fenimore & RamirezRuiz 1999). We thus suspect that this newly-identified emission component is an external\nshock signature.\nFurther evidence supporting the external shock hypothesis can be found from the relationship observed between the duration of the post-quiescent emission episode and the quiescent time (Ramirez-Ruiz & Merloni 2001; Ramirez-Ruiz, Merloni, & Rees 2001). These\nauthors found a linear, one-to-one ratio which they interpreted as a metastable configuration\nin the outflow such that a significant energy fraction still stored in the fireball is available for\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nliberation through additional internal shocks at a later time. Therefore a longer quiescent\ninterval will be followed by a longer post-quiescent emission episode. GRB 960530 and GRB\n980125 do not obey this relation. In GRB 960530, the ratio of the post-quiescent emission\nepisode duration to the quiescent time is 37s/233s = 0.16, while in GRB 980125 the ratio\nis 45s/161s = 0.28. These values deviate considerably from those considered \"standard\" for\nquiescent GRBs. Because these values are not as expected for internal shocks, they could be\nexamples of external shocks.\nThe newly-identified long-lag pulses have been found to occur towards the end of these\nGRBs; however, we note that the long-lag pulse in GRB 980125 occurred prior to an additional concluding FRED pulse. (NOTE: both quiescent pulses have nearly the same peak\nflux.) The long-lag component may be present at even earlier times in other bursts. If so,\nthen the newly-identified pulse type may be difficult to isolate because it is smooth, broad,\nand faint: it could overlap with narrower internal shock pulses to create complex temporal\nstructures and complex spectral evolution. We note that many GRBs can be characterized\nby complex combinations of overlapping broad and narrow pulses.\n\n3.2.\n\nImpact on the Lag vs. Peak Luminosity Relation\n\nThe lag vs. peak luminosity relation (Norris, Marani, & Bonnell 2000) is\nL53 \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 \u03c4 \u22121.14\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = (lag31 /0.01s), lag31 is the lag between the 100-300 keV channel and the 25-50\nkeV channel, and L53 is the isotropic peak luminosity on the 256 ms timescale in units of\n1053 erg s\u22121 . The relation was originally calibrated for a half-dozen GRBs of known redshift.\nHowever, the anomalously-underluminous long-lag GRB 980425 was not included in the\ncalibration.\nThe long-lag emission pulses of GRBs 960530 and 980125 provide a dilemma for the lag\nvs. peak luminosity relation, since that relation implicitly assumes that each GRB can be\ncharacterized by a single lag. However, very long post-quiescent lags do not put the relation\nat risk since there are normal bursts having even longer lags. According to figure 2 of Norris\n(2002), roughly 300 individual GRBs have lag21 > 0.43 s, where lag21 is the lag between\nthe 50-100 keV channel and the 25-50 keV channel (lag21 = 1.17s for GRB 960530 and\nlag21 = 0.42s for GRB 980125). The long post-quiescent lags of GRBs 960530 and 980125\nare common enough that they appear to represent a normal GRB behavior.\nIt is possible that some bursts exhibit only the smooth, long lag (external shock) component. The variable, short lag (internal shock) component would most likely be unde-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntected in these bursts. There is a distinct possibility, then, that Norris (2002) has applied the lag vs. peak luminosity relation to bursts dominated by short-lag components as\nwell as to potentially different bursts dominated by long-lag components. Quiescent GRBs\n960530 and 980125 can provide a consistency check for GRBs that exhibit both behaviors. One would expect the post-quiescent to pre-quiescent luminosity ratios of these GRBs\nasobtainedf romthelagmeasurements to be equal to their peak flux ratios.\nFor pre-quiescent episode a and post-quiescent episode b, the lag vs. peak luminosity\nrelation predicts a ratio of peak luminosities\nLb\n\u03c4b\n= ( )\u22121.14 .\nLa\n\u03c4a\n\n(3)\n\nFor GRB 960530, \u03c4b /\u03c4a = 8.7, from which Lb /La = 0.065. However, the ratio of 256 ms\npeak fluxes gives Pb /Pa = Lb /La = 0.46. For GRB 980125, \u03c4b /\u03c4a = 0.048, which predicts\nLb /La = 0.024. The ratio of 256 ms peak fluxes is Pb /Pa = Lb /La = 0.15.\nThe peak luminosities of the short-lag (a) and long-lag (b) components are plotted in\nfigure 4 together with the six short-lag GRBs (filled diamonds) used to calibrate the lag\nvs. peak luminosity relation (Norris, Marani, & Bonnell 2000). The luminosities of the\nlong-lag components are predicted using both the lag vs. peak luminosity relation and peak\nflux ratios; the values predicted by the lag vs. peak luminosity relation lie on the theoretical\n(dashed) line while those predicted from peak flux ratios are shifted vertically from this line.\nThe luminosities calculated from peak fluxes are larger than those calculated from the lag\nvs. peak luminosity relation, suggesting that the luminosities of these long-lag components\nare overluminous relative to the lag vs. peak luminosity relation.\nThis is difficult to reconcile with long-lag GRB 980425, which is underluminous relative\nto the lag vs. peak luminosity relation (see figure 4) rather than overluminous. Even though\nGRB 980425 and the post-quiescent emission of GRBs 960530 and 980125 all have long lags\nof similar durations, it appears that these lags are not good predictors of peak luminosity.\nThe long-lag GRBs do not all obey the same lag vs. peak luminosity relation as short-lag\nGRBs, and it is possible that they do not obey a lag vs. peak luminosity relation at all.\n\n3.3.\n\nHow Common is the Long-Lag Emission Component?\n\nThe long-lag emission component is likely common in many GRBs, even though it has,\nthus far, only been expicitly identified in only two quiescent GRBs. The lag calculations\nof Norris, Marani, & Bonnell (2000) use an apodization technique to remove low-intensity\nemission from the lag calculation because a long-lag signature hidden in the low-intensity\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nemission is capable of distorting the lag measurement (e.g. GRB 990123). The authors thus\nimplicitly recognize the presence of a long-lag component arising from low-intensity emission.\nIn addition to this signature, we have seen evidence of additional long-lag emission in the\ndecaying tail of GRB 991216 (BATSE trigger 7906). As indicated by Norris (2002), it is also\npossible that many GRBs consist of a long-lag component only.\n\n3.4.\n\nImpact on Theoretical Models\n\nThe two different pulse types observed here presumably arise from the same collimated\nrelativistic outflow. The narrow pulses originate from colliding shells in the high-\u0393, tightlycollimated jet center (e.g. M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Rees, & Wijers (1998); Kumar & Piran (2000)), where\n\u0393 is the bulk Lorentz factor. The external shocks initiating the onset of afterglow are\nproduced by a low-\u0393, slowly-expanding shock found at the interface between the jet and\nthe external medium (i.e. the external shock). The opening angle of the jet should increase\nas deceleration sets in (e.g. Ramirez-Ruiz & Fenimore (1999)). The detailed structure of\nGRB relativistic jets is still unclear, but determination of this structure is currently being\nperformed using numerical hydrodynamic codes (e.g. (Zhang, Woosley, & MacFadyen 2003;\nAloy et al. 2003)). In fact, hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the beaming angle of the\nhigh-\u0393 component is limited to \u223c 5\u25e6 , whereas the low-\u0393 component can have a beaming angle\nexceeding 15\u25e6 Zhang, Woosley, & MacFadyen (2003). The angular expansion of the external\nshock can be aided by the presence of a \"cocoon jet\", which is a secondary jet structure that\nforms when energy is deposited in a stellar cavity prior to breakout Ramirez-Ruiz, Celotti,\n& Rees (2002).\nIn the standard internal/external shock model, deceleration of the relativistic ejecta\nsets in at some deceleration distance Rdec \u223c \u0393\u22122/(3\u2212s) in the surrounding environment with\ndensity n(r) \u223c r \u2212s , resulting in a temporal delay between the prompt internal shock \u03b3-ray\nemission and the afterglow (Ramirez-Ruiz, Celotti, & Rees 2002). Thus, for a given density\nprofile, large \u0393 yields a small Rdec . A temporal overlap between the internal and external\nshock emission would be expected in these cases, producing complex \u03b3-ray light curves. The\noptical flash that occurred some \u223c 40 s into the prompt \u03b3-ray emission of GRB 990123 has\nbeen interpreted as deceleration during the burst due to the reverse external shock (Sari &\nPiran 1999; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, & Rees 1999; Soderberg & Ramirez-Ruiz 2002). Interestingly, the\noptical flash is temporally coincident with the long-lag component of GRB 990123. Sari &\nPiran (1999) note that the x-ray emission peaked some \u223c 60 s into the burst. This overlaps\nin time with the long-lag emission, suggesting that the long-lag component may represent\nthe onset of the afterglow, e.g. the long-lived forward shock emission. On the other hand, the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nlow-intensity long-lag emission exhibits some short timescale variability. Fenimore, RamirezRuiz, & Wu (1999) demonstrated that the widths of these low-intensity pulses do not evolve\nwith time, suggesting no deceleration and an internal shock origin. However, this does not\npreclude the possibility of narrow late-time pulses overlapping a broad long-lag emission\ncomponent. We note that these behaviors are quite unlike the behaviors observed in that\nlatter parts of GRBs 950530 and 980125.\nAs noted before, the BATSE database contains many long-lag GRBs. These often have\ncharacteristics of FREDs, and many are initiated by what appear to be narrow, short-lag\npulses. It is tempting to interpret these as GRBs produced by jets with small Rdec ; few\ninternal shocks are observed, and the onset of afterglow is thus the defining characteristic of\ntheir prompt emission. However, this hypothesis is complicated by the menagerie of other\nphenomena such as X-ray rich GRBs (XRRs), X-Ray Flashes(XRFs), and orphan afterglows,\nthat are also thought to result from off-axis GRB viewing (e.g. M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Rees, & Wijers\n(1998); Zhang et al. (2004)). This is because XRRs and XRFs are spectrally soft, but\notherwise contain many pulses; some of these pulses are narrow and some are broad (R.\nVanderspek, private communication). Our explanation of the long-lag bursts would imply\nthat XRRs and XRFs are jets with small viewing angles (to explain the variable temporal\nstructure) seen at large redshift, rather than being GRB jets viewed off-axis. However, Bloom\net al. (2003) have shown that two recent XRFs originated at redshifts less than z = 3.5.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nAt least two quiescent GRBs exhibit multiple lags. The short-lag component is consistent with internal shocks while an external shock explanation is preferred for the smooth\nlong-lag component. The long-lag component is broad and faint, and is possibly present\nbut unrecognizable in many bursts. The apodization of (Norris, Marani, & Bonnell 2000)\nimplicitly recognizes its existence in order to remove it. It is possible that many or all of the\nlong-lag bursts in the sample of Norris (2002) exhibit only the smooth and broad long-lag\ncomponent.\nBecause the short and long lags found in these quiescent GRBs are so different, we have\nassumed that there are two distinct GRB pulse types. This hypothesis needs to be verified.\nThe best way to approach this problem is via statistical and/or data mining studies of GRB\npulse characteristics. It is important to determine the existence of one continuous pulse\ndistribution or poossibly distinctly different distributions. Detailed analyses of BATSE and\nSwif t GRB data are planned to corroborate this work.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThe lag vs. peak luminosity relation apparently requires re-calibration. It is not clear\nthat long-lag pulses obey the same relation as short-lag pulses, or if they even obey a lag\nvs. peak luminosity relation. Since there is a correlation between lag and variability, the\nvariability vs. peak luminosity relation (Reichart et al. 2001) might require similar recalibration.\nThe simplest explanation for the large number of long-lag GRBs found in the BATSE\ndatabase is that they are GRBs viewed from off the jet axis. The tightly-beamed, variable,\nshort-lag internal shocks would not be seen from large viewing angles, whereas the more\nwidely-beamed, smooth, long-lag external shocks would be. However, it is difficult to reconcile this explanation at the present time with some of the other similar phenomena associated\nwith GRBs (e.g. x-ray rich GRBs, Gamma-Ray Flashes, and Orphan Afterglows).\n\n5.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referee for a careful reading of this manuscript, and\nfor suggestions that strengthened the theoretical discussion.
