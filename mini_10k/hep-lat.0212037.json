M. Green)\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIntroductory Overview on Goals, Strategies, and\nMethods\n\n2.1\n\nModeling Nuclear Forces\n\nThe theory of nuclear forces was pioneered by Yukawa [1] in 1935. A particle of intermediate mass, a meson, accounts for the interaction energy of\nthe proton and neutron. In the framework of a quantum field theory the\nmeson appears as the quantum of an effective field that describes the strong\ninteraction [2]. The approximate range of the interaction\nR=\n\n~c\nmc2\n\n(1)\n\nis roughly consistent with R \u2248 2 fm, for a meson mass in the region of\nm \u2248 100 MeV. Those numbers are crude estimates based on the uncertainty\nrelation (for energy and time) and the contemporary experimental evidence.\nAn effective neutron-proton interaction can be obtained from solutions\nof the Klein-Gordon equation for the meson field \u03c6\n(\u0003 + m2 )\u03c6(x) = g \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c8(x) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith the pion-nucleon coupling g. In the static limit, where the product of\nnucleon fields \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 is replaced with a generic point-like source,\n(\u2212\u2206 + m2 )\u03c6(~r ) = g\u03b4(~r ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nthe solution, i.e. the static Green function,\n\u03c6(x) =\n\ng e\u2212mr\n4\u03c0 r\n\n(4)\n\nis interpreted as a potential energy function, the 'Coulomb potential' of\nthe meson theory. (Units are such that ~ = c = 1, conversion is ~c =\n0.197 GeV fm.) This line of thought is in close analogy to electrodynamics\nwhere the Coulomb potential emerges as the solution of a Poisson equation\nwith a static point-like charge (source).\nSince the early work, the meson theory of nuclear forces has received\nmuch attention and refinements. One of the more significant insights [3]\nhas been that the range of the nucleon-nucleon force can be subdivided into\nthree regions:\n\u2022 The long-range region, inter-nucleon distances are above r \u2248 1.5 fm.\nHere we have attraction. This is the region described by the Yukawa\npotential.\n2\n\n\f\u2022 Intermediate-range attraction, around r \u2248 1.0 fm.\n\u2022 Short-range repulsion, below r \u2248 0.5 fm.\nOther salient features are:\n\u2022 A tensor force, important for the quadrupole moment of the deuteron.\n\u2022 The presence of a spin-orbit force.\n\u2022 Charge independence of the strong interaction.\nIn order to describe the short-distance region, scalar and vector mesons\n(\u03b7, \u03c1, \u03c9, . . .) are needed in the boson-exchange model. Remarkably, a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\ncorrelated state (known as the \u03c3 meson) is relied upon to produce intermediate range attraction. The pseudoscalar meson (\u03c0), which also gives rise to\nthe long-range (though finite) Yukawa potential, contributes significantly to\nthe tensor force.\nAfter approximately half a century the meson theory of nuclear forces is\nat a mature, sophisticated stage. Exhaustive review articles exist, for example Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7] may serve the interested reader. Boson-exchange models\nof this type presently constitute the state-of-the-art for effective theories of\nnuclear forces.\nTypical for this class of models is an effective Lagrangian, say for the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction, such as\nX\u0012\nL\u03c8\u0304\u03c6\u03c8 =\n\u2212 gP \u03c8i\u03b35 \u03c8\u03c6P + gS \u03c8\u03c8\u03c6S\n\u03c6\n\n\u2212gV \u03c8\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8\u03c6V\n\u03bc \u2212\n\nfV\n\u03c8\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c8\u2202\u03bc \u03c6V\n\u03bd\n2M\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwith pseudoscalar gP , scalar gS , vector gV and tensor fV couplings for the\nvarious bosons \u03c6, and M is the nucleon mass [7]. Potentials are obtained\nfrom tree-level diagrams to the nucleon-nucleon propagator. Those are most\nnaturally written in momentum space. The simplest contribution derived\nfrom (5) is\n\"\n#\n2\n2\n~k)\nm\ng\nS\n(\n12\nP\n+\n~\u03c4 * ~\u03c4 . . . ,\n(6)\nV (~k) = \u2212 P ~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32 \u2212 ~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32\n~k2 + m2\n~k2 + m2 1 2\n12M\nP\nP\nwhere mP is the pseudoscalar mass. This already is the non-relativistic reduction where the three terms correspond to a (coordinate-space) \u03b4-function,\na Yukawa, and a tensor potential, the latter containing\nS12 = 3(~\u03c31 * ~k)(~\u03c32 * ~k) \u2212 ~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32~k2 .\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe momentum transfer is ~k = ~q \u2032 \u2212 ~q and ~\u03c31 , ~\u03c32 are the nucleon spins.\nIn addition, for each type of coupling momentum cutoff form factors are\nincluded with the coupling constants gP , gS , gV and fV , for example\n!n P\n2 \u2212 m2\n\u039b\nP\nP\n.\n(8)\ngP2 \u2192 gP2\n\u039b2 + ~k2\nP\n\nThe inverse of a momentum cutoff parameter \u039bP is a length, and as such\nindicates the region of validity of the model. Values of \u2248 1 GeV, or equivalently \u2248 0.2 fm are typical. Other refinements of the model include isobar\n(\u2206) degrees of freedom, and the extension to the strange hadron sector [8, 9].\nTypical potentials are illustrated in Fig. 1.\n300\n\n200\nV [MeV]\n\n\u03c9\n100\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n-100\n\u03c3\n\n-200\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nr [fm]\n\nFigure 1: Generic form of a central nucleon-nucleon potential according to\nboson exchange models and its contribution from various bosons. Schematic\ndrawing after Ref. [7].\nThe philosophy of boson exchange models is to take the phenomenology\nof low-energy excitations of the hadronic vacuum as a starting point. The experimentally known spectrum of mesons and hadrons is used to reconstruct\nthe forces between those particles. The result is an effective theory with adjustable parameters and predictive power in a reasonably well-defined realm\n4\n\n\fof validity. An example is shown in Fig. 2. Naturally, the question of how\nhadronic interaction results from the underlying microscopic structure of\nhadrons and the, as we now know, complicated structure of the hadronic\nvacuum, is beyond the scope, and aim, of the model.\n\nFigure 2: Nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shift for channels 1 S0 and 1 D2\ncompiled from Ref. [10]. In the 1 D2 channel the smooth curve is a 'Bonnpotential' result.\nIn the present context we wish to look at hadronic interactions from\nthe perspective of lattice QCD. Since the physics of hadronic interactions\nis contained in the low-energy, non-perturbative, regime of QCD the lattice\nformulation is well suited for this task.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Lattice QCD Perspective\n\nFrom the lattice QCD point of view the three-fold subdivision of the internucleon interaction region, see Fig. 1, appears in a new light:\n\u2022 The long-range region is expected to be dominated by excitations of\nthe QCD vacuum that are recovered only in the chiral limit of the\nlattice simulation. If Wilson fermions are used this region can be\nmonitored by extrapolating to the zero-mass limit of the pseudoscalar\nmeson, which is the Goldstone boson of QCD. The mechanism for pion\nexchange is available on the lattice because correlated quark-antiquark\n5\n\n\fpairs are dynamically provided by the lattice action. This is true even\nif the simulation is limited to the quenched approximation.\n\u2022 In the intermediate-distance region various excitations of the QCD\nvacuum of somewhat higher mass will take over. Those may be pure\nhadronic states, gluonic excitations, or combinations of such. In contrast to boson exchange models the precise nature of those need not\nbe known as input. Again those would be accounted for by the lattice action. At r \u2248 1.0 fm this is really a transition region between\nan appropriate description in terms of effective hadronic fields and\nthe asymptotically free regime of the interior quark-gluon cores of the\nhadrons. The validity of traditional boson exchange models seems\nsomewhat stretched here. With the currently available lattice constants (\u2248 0.1 \u2013 0.4 fm) the intermediate-distance region appears appropriate for lattice QCD.\n\u2022 For small distances the compositeness of the hadrons, as finite-size\nquark-gluon systems, will play the dominant role. Not surprisingly,\nquark models have been used to study the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The energies involved are naturally larger, for example \u2248 2 GeV,\nand thus point to lattice constants of about \u2248 0.1 fm, being not out\nof reach of contemporary lattice simulations. Lattice QCD provides\ndynamically for the compositeness of the hadrons. Internal hadronic\nstructure is, in turn, crucial for the features of the residual interaction.\nThus lattice QCD is in a position to combine the classic nucleon-nucleon interaction regions in a single unified approach. Moreover, the strange hadron\nsector, or effects of strangeness in the light-quark sector are straightforwardly incorporated.\n\n2.3\n\nShort and Long Term Goals for Lattice QCD\n\nWhile boson exchange models have a long tradition, attempts to study residual interactions between systems of hadrons within lattice QCD are only in\nan experimental stage. The physics of hadronic interactions in terms of first\nprinciples is rather involved, see Fig. 3. Conceptual, technical, and computational questions are very much in the foreground at this time. The\ntentative nature of this situation will be apparent throughout this chapter.\nNevertheless, there is potential for new physics, or at least for understanding known phenomena in a new light. In particular, probing hadronic\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: Cartoon of a strongly interacting hadron-hadron system from the\nQCD perspective.\nmatter at somewhat higher energies, say in the 4 \u2013 8 GeV region with electron beams, has become a new focus in experimental nuclear physics. The\ninterest here lies in the boundary between particle (high energy) and nuclear (low energy) physics which we will refer to as hadronic physics. Our\nshort-term working list is as follows:\n\u2022 Discuss various basic concepts and numerical methods using simple\nlattice models.\n\u2022 Study simple systems, mostly meson-meson, and extract non-relativistic potentials.\n\u2022 Explore alternative approaches to the problem, like momentum space\nand coordinate space formulations.\nAs a long-term perspective we have in mind:\n\u2022 Study realistic meson-meson, meson-baryon, and baryon-baryon systems. For example, the pion-nucleon system features the prominent\ndelta resonance, a hallmark of strong-interaction physics.\n\u2022 Residual interactions in the strange-hadron sector.\n\u2022 Develop advanced methods, possibly the direct extraction of scattering\namplitudes from the lattice.\n7\n\n\f2.4\n\nProbing the Lattice\n\nA hadron-hadron force may be viewed as a hyperfine interaction in the\nhadron-hadron system. In one way or another, we must therefore compare\nthe mass spectrum of the interacting hadron-hadron system to the spectrum\nof the non-interacting hadron-hadron system.\nAbout two decades ago it was realized that finite volume effects may\nin principle be exploited to achieve this end [11]. The energy levels of a\ntwo-hadron system, say two mesons with mass m each, are subject to finitesize corrections. Those decrease with powers of 1/L as the lattice size L\nincreases. The formal study of finite-size effects in this context is due to\nL\u00fcscher [12, 13]. In Ref. [13] the following equation for the ground-state\ntwo-body energy shift\n\u001a\n\u001b\na20\na0\n4\u03c0a0\n1 + c1 + c2 2 + o(L\u22126 )\n(9)\nW0 \u2212 2m = \u2212\nmL3\nL\nL\nis derived. It is valid for s-wave elastic scattering, below the particle production threshold. Above c1 = \u22122.837297, c2 = 6.375183, and a0 is the\ns-wave scattering length. This result has been the basis for a number of\nstudies [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. The extraction of\nscattering information beyond the static limit, like phase shifts at nonzero\nrelative energy, is formally more involved [27, 28].\nIn general it will be necessary to probe the lattice (vacuum) with oneand two-hadron operators. Let \u03c6p~ (t) be a composite field, say, constructed\nfrom quark\u2013antiquark (meson) or from three\u2013quark (baryon) fields. Let p~\nbe the hadron momentum, for simplicity we disregard additional quantum\nnumbers. The time correlation matrix built from one-hadron operators\n(2)\n\nCp~ ~q (t, t0 ) = h\u03c6\u2020p~ (t) \u03c6~q (t0 )i \u2212 h\u03c6\u2020p~ (t)ih\u03c6~q (t0 )i\n\n(10)\n\n(2)\n\npossesses eigenvalues \u03bbm1 (t, t0 ) which behave exponentially,\n\u2212wm1 (t\u2212t0 )\n.\n\u03bb(2)\nm1 (t, t0 ) \u221d e\n\n(11)\n\nThe time correlation matrix is just the euclidean version of a propagator,\nin our example a 2-point function C (2) on the hadronic level (a 4- or 6point function on the quark level). Thus from (11) the energies wm1 of the\none-meson system can be extracted. Typically, this is done numerically. A\npractical example is shown in Fig. 4. The interpretation of the wm1 is that\nthose are energies of the hadron moving through the lattice. In principle,\nthe hadron could be in an internally excited state.\n8\n\n\fFigure 4: Typical time correlation functions (eigenvalues) extracted from a\nlattice simulation. The examples are for a pseudoscalar meson (PSM) and\na vector meson (VEC) using QCD3+1 and Wilson fermions.\nThe fields \u03a6p~ (t) = \u03c6\u2212~p (t) \u03c6+~p (t) can be used for probing two-hadron\nstates. These are operators with total momentum P~ = 0. Note that ~p in\nthis example means the relative momentum of the two-hadron system. We\nconstruct a 4-point correlation matrix\n(4)\n\nCp~ q~ (t, t0 ) = h\u03a6\u2020p~ (t) \u03a6~q (t0 )i \u2212 h\u03a6\u2020p~ (t)ih\u03a6~q (t0 )i ,\n\n(12)\n\nand, correspondingly, the eigenvalues\n\u2212Wn (t\u2212t0 )\n\u03bb(4)\nn (t, t0 ) \u221d e\n\n(13)\n\nyield the energy levels Wn of the two-hadron system. Most importantly,\nthese levels somehow contain the desired residual interaction.\nA sensible definition of the latter, of course, also involves the eigenvectors\nof C (2) and C (4) , however, comparison of the level schemes\ndef\n\n{W m=(m1 ,m2 ) = wm1 + wm2 } to\n9\n\n{Wn }\n\n(14)\n\n\falready gives important insight into the nature of the hadron-hadron force.\nProbing the lattice with momentum-type operators is only one of several\nalternatives. The use of coordinate space operators is another popular choice\n[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35].\n\n2.5\n\nFinite-size Methods\n\nThe spectrum {Wn } of the interacting two-body system may be utilized in\na variety of ways. L\u00fcscher has shown how to extract scattering phase shifts\ndirectly from the spectrum [28]. The idea is to match the poles of (interacting) Green functions that live on the finite-sized periodic lattice to the\npoles of (free) Green functions in infinite volume. Since the lattice Green\nfunctions comprise the interaction, comparison in the asymptotic (free) region yields the phase shifts. Using methods similar to the 'Jost' formalism\nof scattering theory [36] an equation of the following form\nh\ni\ndet e2i\u03b4 \u2212 (M + i)\u22121 (M \u2212 i) = 0\n(15)\n\nis derived. Here M = M (q 2 ) is an analytically constructed energy-dependent\nmatrix (W 2 = m2 +q 2 ). It reflects features of the 'natural' (free) spectrum of\nthe periodic lattice. The other matrix e2i\u03b4 in (15) contains a set of scattering\nphase shifts \u03b4l (q 2 ). The lattice simulation gives a discrete spectrum {Wn }.\nA certain energy Wn , for a fixed n, is then used to calculate M (qn2 ) and (15)\nis solved for the corresponding \u03b4l (qn2 ). This yields a set of phase shifts, as\nmany as the size of M , at each energy Wn . The physical \u03b4l (qn2 ), at a discrete\nqn2 , is contained in this set.\nA simple illustration of the idea behind this formalism [27] is the following: Consider a solution \u03c8(x) of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the noninteracting\ncase with a phase kL = 2\u03c0 n. It satisfies \u03c8(x) = \u03c8(x+L), see Fig. 5(a). If the\ninteraction is turned on, say an attractive potential with range |x| \u2264 0.2L,\nthe periodic boundary condition would be violated, see Fig. 5(b), unless\ncompensated for by a simultaneous change in the kinematical phase kL.\nIn other words, the change in kL necessary to restore the original periodic\nboundary conditions, see Fig. 5(c), is a measure for the phase shift.\nThe kinematical phase kL is changed by varying k or L. Varying L\nis reminiscent of a finite-size effect, see (9). Finding the change in k at\nfixed L is equivalent to finding all (discrete) two-body levels {Wn } for the\ninteracting case. This method, which already appears in Ref. [13], has been\nused by L\u00fcscher and Wolff [27] to obtain scattering phase shifts in an O(3)\nnonlinear sigma model on a 1+1 dimensional lattice.\n10\n\n\fFigure 5: Generic solutions \u03c8(x) of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation: (a) no interaction, (b) an attractive potential around x \u2248 0, and (c) with decreased wave\nnumber k to restore the original phase conditions.\n\n2.6\n\nResidual Interaction\n\nScattering phase shifts are very close to observable quantities (cross sections). This is an appealing feature of L\u00fcscher's method, as the above\nprocedure came to be known. On the other hand an effective residual interaction between hadrons is more in line with the historic development and\nhas a heuristic value which should not be underestimated. We will therefore\nplace considerable emphasis on this aspect. In this approach the information contained in the 2- and 4-point correlation matrices, see (10) and (12),\nwill be utilized in a different way.\nIn principle an effective residual interaction is subject to definition. Towards this end we will first split a free, or non-interacting, part off the\n4-point correlation matrix (12)\nC (4) (t, t0 ) = C(t, t0 ) + CI (t, t0 ) ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere C is built from 2-point correlators C (2) and describes two non-interacting\nhadrons on the lattice. This can be accomplished by means of diagrammatic\n11\n\n\fconsiderations. In terms of (16) we then define an effective residual interaction as\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2202\n\u22121/2\n\u22121/2\n.\n(17)\nHI = \u2212 ln C\nCI C\n\u2202t\nIn principle the interaction Hamiltonian (potential) is non-local. Our focus\nis to compute HI from a lattice simulation and eventually calculate the\ncorresponding phase shifts.\nThe above method relies on lattice sizes large enough to accommodate\ntwo hadrons. Assuming a manageable lattice L3 \u00d7 T with, say, L = 10\nand physical extent of about 4.0 fm this translates into a lattice constant\nof a = 0.4 fm. As experience with hadron spectroscopy has shown the\nstandard Wilson plaquette action [37] requires a \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.2 fm in order\nto work reasonably close to the continuum limit. This does not sound very\nencouraging for putting multi-hadron systems on the lattice.\n\n2.7\n\nUse of Improved Actions\n\nFortunately, considerable progress in recent years has provided us with socalled 'improved' lattice actions [38]. Here, in the simplest form, one supplements the Wilson action, built from elementary 1 \u00d7 1 plaquettes (pl), with\nlarger 1 \u00d7 2 rectangles (rt)\n\u0001\nSG [U ] = \u03b2 Spl [U ] + crt Srt [U ] .\n(18)\n\nThe Wilson part of the action (pl) approaches the classical (tree-level) limit\nlike o(a4 ) as a \u2192 0. If crt = \u22121/20 the (rt) term in (18) improves this behavior to order o(a5 ). We refer to such an action as o(a) tree-level improved.\nBetter yet, one can also account for a large part of the quantum fluctuations of the gluon field through renormalizing the link variables U\u03bc (x). Of\ncourse, this would destroy the tree-level cancellations between the (pl) and\n(rt) terms in (18). Within mean-field theory it can be 'repaired' by changing\nthe factor crt to\n1\n,\n(19)\ncrt = \u2212\n20u2\nwhere u, known as the tadpole factor, is the fourth root of the average\n(4-link) plaquette\n1\nu = h Re Tr Upl i1/4 .\n(20)\n3\nThe tadpole factor can easily be computed self-consistently within a running lattice simulation. There are also radiative corrections which can be\nincorporated into the lattice action to some extent [39, 40, 41].\n12\n\n\fThe benefit of improvement is that the physical continuum limit, a \u2192 0,\nis approached 'faster' compared to the Wilson action. The 'same physics' is\ndescribed with improved actions at larger lattice constants a. For example,\na Wilson action at a \u2248 0.1 fm may give a similar mass spectrum as an\nimproved action at a \u2248 0.3 fm. For our present purpose of putting two\nhadrons on the lattice, this means that, stretching things a bit and choosing\na \u2248 0.4 fm, we would only need an L3 \u00d7 T lattice with about L = 10 for a\nlattice of 4.0 fm across. This should give us a first window on two-hadron\nsystems on the lattice.\nImproved actions have been a big innovation for lattice field theory [42].\nThere are versions of improved actions including fermions [43], and work\npushing the improvement to higher order, for example o(a2 ) improved actions [44, 45, 46]. \u2013 In Appendix 8 we have collected some topics that\nare relevant to this chapter. \u2013 Strong-interaction physics, in particular the\nboundary between particle and nuclear physics, is now open to studies within\nquantum chromodynamics.\n\n3\n\nA Simple U(1) Lattice Model in 2+1 Dimensions\n\nIn order to discuss some practical work we look at a simple but non-trivial\nmodel. We consider U(1) gauge theory on an Ld \u00d7 T lattice, in d + 1\ndimensions, with d = 2. The intent is to study the interaction between\ntwo mesons living in a plane. For the sake of simplicity we work with the\n(unimproved) Wilson action and use staggered fermions.\n\n3.1\n\nLattice Action\n\nFor a U(1) gauge group the link variables are\nU\u03bc (x) = ei\u0398\u03bc (x) \u2208 U(1) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwith \u03bc = 1 . . . d + 1, x = (~x, t), and \u0398\u03bc (x) \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0). The plaquette (pl)\nvariables are\n\nwhere\n\nUpl (\u03bc, \u03bd; x) = U\u03bc (x)U\u03bd (x + \u03bc\u0302)U\u03bc\u2020 (x + \u03bd\u0302)U\u03bd\u2020 (x)\n\u0001\n= exp i\u0398pl (\u03bc, \u03bd; x) ,\n\n(22)\n\n\u0398pl (\u03bc, \u03bd; x) = \u0398\u03bc (x) + \u0398\u03bd (x + \u03bc\u0302) \u2212 \u0398\u03bc (x + \u03bd\u0302) \u2212 \u0398\u03bd (x)\n\n(23)\n\n13\n\n\fis the oriented plaquette angle. We write \u03bc\u0302 for a vector of length a in\ndirection \u03bc. The (compact form of the) Wilson gauge field action is\nXX\nXX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 cos \u0398pl (\u03bc, \u03bd; x) .\nSG = \u03b2\nRe 1 \u2212 Upl (\u03bc, \u03bd; x) = \u03b2\nx \u03bc<\u03bd\n\nx \u03bc<\u03bd\n\n(24)\nFor simplicity, fermions are treated in the staggered, or Kogut-Susskind,\nscheme where Dirac indices have been 'spin-diagonalized' away [47, 48, 49].\nThus we work with one-component Grassmann fields \u03c7f (x) defined on the\nlattice sites x = (~x, t), with (external) flavor index f = u, d, s. There is just\none color index, C = 1, which we omit. The fermionic action can be written\nas\nXX\nSF =\n\u03c7\u0304f (x) G\u22121 (x, y)[U ] \u03c7f (y) ,\n(25)\nx,y\n\nf\n\nwith the flavor-independent fermion matrix\nh\ni\n1X\n\u03b7\u03bc (x) U\u03bc (x)\u03b4x+\u03bc\u0302,y \u2212 U\u03bc\u2020 (y)\u03b4x,y+\u03bc\u0302 + mF \u03b4x,y ,\nG\u22121 (x, y) =\n2 \u03bc\n\n(26)\n\nincluding a mass term.

We\nx\nwill use gauge configurations in the quenched approximation.\n\n3.2\n\nMeson Fields\n\nThe simplest hadrons we can work with are pseudoscalar mesons. In the\nstaggered scheme suitable one-meson operators are\nX\n\u03c6p~ (t) = L\u22122\nei~p*~x \u03c7\u0304d (~x, t) \u03c7u (~x, t) .\n(28)\n~\nx\n\nThe ~x sum extends over the spatial sites of the lattice. The fixed flavor\nassignment u,d leading to a \u03c0 + will simplify computations. For d = 2, a\n14\n\n\fplanar lattice, the momentum parameters are\np=\n~\n\n2\u03c0\n(k1 , k2 ) ,\nL\n\nwhere k1,2 = \u2212(\n\nL\nL\n\u2212 1) . . . ,\n2\n2\n\neven L ,\n\n(29)\n\nif L is odd we have ki = \u2212(L \u2212 1)/2 . . .

However, gluonic correlations between the mesons are also present\n17\n\n\fbecause the gauge configuration average h. . .i is taken over the product of\nall four fields. (This is also true for C (4C) and C (4D) .) Gluonic correlations\nof course contribute to the effective residual interaction. Hence it is essential\nto isolate the uncorrelated part contained in C (4A) + C (4B) .\n\n3.4\n\nCorrelation Matrix for Noninteracting Mesons\n\nLet us examine C (4A) .

The first three terms on the right-hand\nside of (50) are illustrated in Fig. 7. The dashed lines indicate that the\npropagators are correlated through gluons. Evidently only the first one of\nthe three separable terms in (50) represents free, uncorrelated, mesons. All\nother terms in (50) are sources of residual effective interaction between the\nmesons.

The free correlator C\ndescribes two\nnoninteracting identical lattice mesons. Their internal structure and masses\nconsistently arise from the dynamics determined by the lattice field model\nand its numerical implementation. As already mentioned the separable term\nin (31) is identical zero because of the u, d flavor assignment to the Grassmann fields of the one-meson operators (28).\n(4)\nC\nmay be expressed in terms of the 2-point correlator C (2) .

This\nproperty reflects Bose symmetry with respect to the composite mesons. Permutation of the mesons, one with momentum +~\np the other with momentum\n(4A)\n\u2212~\np, results in the substitution p~ \u2192 \u2212~\np. Clearly, combining diagrams C\n(4B)\n(4)\ninto C is crucial for the symmetry (60) to hold.\nand C\n\n3.5\n\nComputation with Random Sources\n\nThe computation of C (4) from the expression (42) is a formidable numerical task. First, propagator matrix elements are needed for arbitrary ~y , as\nopposed to only one column of G like in (40). Typically G is computed by\nsolving a linear equation like G\u22121 X (R) = R where R is a given source vector;\nthe solution vector X (R) then represents 'some column' of G. For arbitrary\n~y such a strategy translates into Ld linear equations, all for a fixed time slice\nt0 and not even counting color indices (or Dirac indices in case of Wilson\nfermions).\nFurthermore, the sum over lattice sites in (42) contains L4d terms. Even\nfor d = 2 and our simple U(1) gauge model those are \u2248 108 terms. In a\nrealistic calculation, for d = 3 and SU(3), these would be L4d 34 \u2248 1014 for\na meson-meson system, and even larger if baryons are involved. It is clear\nthat an efficient numerical technique is called for to deal with computing\nquark propagators and correlator matrices.\nA practical way is the use of random estimators [54, 55, 56, 57]. Let\nR(x) be a vector of independent complex random deviates with\nhR(x)R\u2217 (y)iR = \u03b4x,y ,\n20\n\n(61)\n\n\fwhere h. . .iR denotes the random R-average. Gaussian deviates come to\nmind, but Z 2 noise also works and may sometimes be more desirable [58].\nThe idea is to solve\nX\nG\u22121 (x, y) X (R) (y) = R(x)\n(62)\ny\n\nfor X (R) , recalling that the fermion matrix G\u22121 is known, then the statistical\naverage\nhX (R) (y)R\u2217 (z)iR = G(y, z)\n(63)\n\nis an estimator for the inverse G of G\u22121 .\nSince random sources R with various characteristics may be chosen the\ntechnique is very versatile. Let us expand our notation, where\nR(r;\u03b1) (x) ,\n\nwith\n\nr = 1 . . . NR ,\n\n(64)\n\nis a finite sample of NR vectors drawn from the distribution. The label \u03b1\ndistinguishes between various types of sources, for example we take \u03b1 = t0\nto mean\nR(r;t0 ) (~x, t) = R(r;t0 ) (~x)\u03b4tt0 .\n(65)\nHere, random sources are placed on one time slice only. A more complicated\nexample is \u03b1 = (t0 , p~ ) with\nR(r;t0 ,~p) (~x, t) = L\u22122 ei~p*~x R(r;t0 ,~p) (~x)\u03b4tt0 .\n\n(66)\n\nThese are Fourier-modified (boosted) sources on time slice t0 .\nGiven a finite sample (64), an estimator for the statistical average of (61)\nis\nNR\nX\n\u2217\n\u2217\n1 X\nR(r;\u03b1) (x)R(r;\u03b2) (y) \u2243\nR(r;\u03b1) (x)R(r;\u03b2) (y) = \u03b4x,y \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 .\nNR r=1\n\n(67)\n\nhri\n\nP\nThe above, intuitive, notation\nhri for the statistical R-average h. . .iR is\nconvenient in expressions of correlation functions. The second \u03b4 on the\nr.h.s. in (67) comes from drawing stochastically independent samples for\neach type of source.\nFor definiteness we continue with sources of type (65) set at a fixed time\nslice t0 . Then the solutions X of the linear equations (62)\nX\nG\u22121 (~xx4 , ~y y4 ) X (r;t0 ) (~y y4 ) = R(r;t0 ) (~x)\u03b4xt04\n(68)\ny y4\n~\n\n21\n\n\fcan be used to estimate columns of the propagator G. Applying G to both\nsides of (68) gives\nX\nX (r;t0 ) (~z z4 ) =\nG(~z z4 , ~xt0 )R(r;t0 ) (~x) .\n(69)\n~\nx\n\n\u2217\nR(r;t0 ) (~y ),\n\ntaking the R-average and using (67) yields\nX\n\u2217\nG(~z z4 , ~y t0 ) =\nX (r;t0 ) (~zz4 )R(r;t0 ) (~y ) .\n(70)\n\nMultiplication with\n\nhri\n\nIn this form the random estimator can be used directly in the expression\n(38) and (42) for C (2) and C (4) , respectively.\nAnother, potentially useful, relation follows from (69)\nX\nX\n\u2217\nG(~z z4 , ~xt0 ) G(~y y4 , ~xt0 )\u2217 .\n(71)\nX (r;t0 ) (~z z4 )X (r;t0 ) (~y y4 ) =\n~\nx\n\nhri\n\nA more general version of (71) can be derived when Fourier-modified sources\n(66) are used.

Therefore an effective residual\ninteraction extracted from the lattice is subject to definition. In this section\nwe study the perturbative expansion of the time correlation matrix for an\ninteracting elementary Bose field on a euclidean lattice. Our intention is to\nfind guidance towards a sensible definition for the lattice simulation.\n\n4.1\n\nPerturbative Definition\n\nLet L\u03020 = L\u03020 (\u03c6\u0302, \u2202 \u03c6\u0302) be the free Lagrangian for an elementary Bose field\n\u03c6\u0302(x) defined on the sites x = (~x, t) of the lattice. It is understood that \u03c6\u0302\nis subject to the usual canonical quantization through commutators. Let\nL\u0302 = L\u03020 + L\u0302I such that L\u0302I = L\u0302I (\u03c6\u0302) is a (small) interaction. In the usual way\nL\u0302 gives rise to a Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124I ,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere \u01240 is the free part and \u0124I a perturbative interaction.

The (nondegenerate) vacuum state |0i satisfies\n\u0124|0i = W0 |0i. We will assume that its energy is zero, W0 = 0.

In this case the free correlator\n(4)\nC would have an eigenvalue zero (for all t).

The corresponding expression (94)\nfor \u0124I will still be valid up to order N = 1 in perturbation theory.

The analogue of (96)\nmay then be considered as the definition of an effective interaction.\nOrder N = 2\nA calculation similar to the above reveals that (96) is valid to order N =\n2. However, for N > 2 the situation is complicated by the presence of\ndisconnected diagrams, see Fig. 8. The diagramatic series of connected\n26\n\n\finsertions of \u0124I still gives rise to the exponential form (96).

This will help to suppress intrinsic excitations\nof the composite particles and thus yields an effective residual interaction\nbetween the mesons (or hadrons) in their respective ground states. How\nwell the excitation of intrinsic degrees of freedom is suppressed depends on\nthe lattice size and on the design of the meson operators.\n27\n\n\f4.3\n\nLattice Symmetries\n\nLattice symmetries should be utilized to reduce the size of the correlation matrices C (2) and C (4) . For an Ld \u00d7 T lattice the action is (usually) invariant under the group O(d, Z) of discrete transformations of the\ncubic sublattice. The representation theory of these groups is standard\n[59]. For example, if d = 2, there are five irreducible representations\n\u0393 = A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 , E, using a common nomenclature, with dimensionalities N\u0393 = 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 respectively. For d = 3 there are, again in common\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n+\nnomenclature, \u0393 = A\u00b1\n1 , A2 , E , T1 , T2 with respective dimensionalities\nN\u0393 = 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 .\nGiven a fixed, discrete, lattice momentum p~ \u2032 the application of group\ntransformations g \u2208 O(d, Z) generates a set of momenta p~ = Og p~ \u2032 that all\nhave the same length p = |~\np |. These transformations define a representation\nof O(d, Z) with basis vectors |~\np > which is in general reducible. Let\nXX\n|~\np >=\n|(\u0393, p)\u01eb >< (\u0393, p)\u01eb|~\np >,\n(100)\n\u0393\n\n\u01eb\n\nwhere |(\u0393, p)\u01eb > denote a set of basis vectors, \u01eb = 1 . . ., of the subspace that\nbelongs to \u0393. Those can be constructed with group theoretical techniques\n[59]. A simple example, which will suffice for our present purposes, is given\nby choosing ~\np = (p, 0), assuming d = 2 and pL/2\u03c0 \u2208 N, and the trivial\none-dimensional representation \u0393 = A1 , thus\n|(A1 , p)1 >=\n\n1\n(|(+p, 0) > +|(0, +p) > +|(\u2212p, 0) > +|(0, \u2212p) >) .\n2\n\n(101)\n\n(4)\n\nSince both the full and the free correlators C (4) and C , respectively,\ncommute with all group operations g \u2208 O(d, Z) there exist reduced matrices,\n(4;\u0393)\nsay C (4;\u0393) and C\n, within each irreducible representation \u0393 such that\n(Schur's lemma)\n< (\u0393, p)\u01eb|C (4) (t, t0 )|(\u0393\u2032 , q)\u01eb\u2032 >= \u03b4\u0393\u0393\u2032 \u03b4\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 Cp(4;\u0393)\nq (t, t0 )\n(4;\u0393)\n\n(102)\n\nand similarly for C\n. Above we identify Cp~ ~q with < p~ |C|~q >.\nSimilar group theoretical considerations are of course also applicable on\na coordinate space |~r > lattice.\nAn example from the QED2+1 model is shown in Fig. 9. The set {W }\nof energy levels, with labels n = 1 . . . 6, belongs to the free system. Those\n(4)\nwere extracted from the asymptotic time behavior of C p~ ~q (t, t0 ), see (59),\n28\n\n\fand are degenerate (in general) for momenta of the same magnitude but\ndifferent directions. The degeneracy is lifted by the residual interaction, the\n(4;\u0393)\nset {W } being extracted from Cp q (t, t0 ). Since the angular momentum\ncontent of the various representations \u0393 = A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 is different (A1\nmostly contains l = 0, B1 and B2 contain l = 2, etc) the hyperfine splitting\ncan be attributed to a spin-orbit like force.\n\nFigure 9: Hyperfine splitting due to the residual interaction for the QED2+1\nmodel [60]. The labels for {W } refer to irreducible representations of the\nlattice symmetry group O(2, Z).\n\n4.4\n\nTruncated Momentum Basis\n\nIt is obvious from (59) and (60) that the reduced matrix elements of the free\ncorrelator have the form\n(4;\u0393)\n\nC p q (t, t0 ) = \u03b4p q c\u0304(\u0393)\np (t, t0 )\n(\u0393)\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(103)\n\nThe functions c\u0304p (t, t0 ) are linear combinations of 2-point correlator ele(2)\nments Cp~ p~ \u2032 with momenta p~ and ~p \u2032 that differ only by their directions.\n29\n\n\f(4;\u0393)\n\nThe eigenvalues of C\n(t, t0 ) describe the time evolution of the eigenstates of a free meson-meson Hamiltonian, say H0 . Since H0 relates to a\ncomposite system, it is useful to think of its degrees of freedom in terms of\nthe relative motion of the two mesons (as clusters) and the intrinsic motion\nof the individual mesons. Assume, for the purpose of discussion, that the\ninternal excitation energies are large (hard modes) compared to the relative\nexcitation energies (soft modes). In principle, the separation of soft and\nhard modes may be enforced by choosing a big enough Ld \u00d7 T lattice:\n\u2022 Large L will yield a dense momentum spectrum p \u221d L\u22121 .\n\n\u2022 Large T will permit suppression of intrinsic excitations, at large t.\nIn practice there are of course numerical limitations, however, one may check\n(4;\u0393)\nand C (4;\u0393)\nhow well those conditions are satisfied. We assume that C\nare available on a truncated set of lattice momenta and both have size N (\u0393) .\nNaturally this will allow us to study features of the effective residual interaction in the long and intermediate range.\n(4;\u0393)\nis already\nThe advantage of working in momentum space is that C\ndiagonal, see (103).

However,\ndepending on the system studied, it may well be that A1 dominates the\nseries.\nThe coordinate space matrix elements of the effective residual interaction\nare obtained from (109) by (discrete lattice) Fourier transformation\nXX\n< ~r |HI |~s >= L\u2212d\nei~p*(~r\u2212~s) e\u2212i~q*(~r+~s) < p~ \u2212 ~q |HI |~\np + ~q > .

In the non-relativistic limit, E(p) \u2192 m + p2 /2m as\nm \u2192 \u221e, the correlator thus becomes independent of p~ and may be replaced\nwith cp~=0 (t, t0 ) in (117).

The time scale for the dynamics of the interaction is much faster\nthan the time scale for the dynamics of the motion for the atoms. Borrowing\na thermodynamics term, we speak of an adiabatic approximation. In our\ncase we simply compute the total energy of the two-meson system at fixed\n(static) relative distance r and interpret the difference to the ground state\nenergy as a potential [64].\nAn example from numerical work on the QED2+1 model [65] is shown in\nFig. 12.

This is the\nreason for the increase (repulsive core) of the potential as r \u2192 0.\nThe right part of Fig. 12 shows a potential computed slightly differently,\nfor the sake of comparison. The perturbative version of (127) leads to\n\"\n#\n(4;\u0393)\nCr r (t, t0 )\n1\n(\u0393)\n1 \u2212 (\u0393)\n.\n(129)\nV (r) \u2248\nt \u2212 t0\nar |\u0101(\u0393) |\u22122\n(\u0393)\n\nIn this way the r-dependence of ar enters the analysis. The results in\nFig. 12 are similar. They shed some light on the validity of the perturbative\ndefinition of HI put forward in Sec. 4.1.\nOf course, only the local part of the effective residual interaction is accessible in this way. Note, however, that a local potential\nXX\nV(~r ) =\n< ~r |(\u0393, r)\u01eb > V (\u0393) (r) < (\u0393, r)\u01eb|~r > ,\n(130)\n\u0393\n\n\u01eb\n\ncompared to (109), may not be the same as the approximate local potential\nof (112) even if the untruncated correlation matrices are used. The reason is that diagonal elements of the non-local part of the effective residual\ninteraction may contribute to the adiabatic local potential.\n35\n\n\fFigure 12: Static meson-meson potential for the QED2+1 model according\nto (128), on the left. On the right a somewhat different approximation\naccording to (129) serves to check the perturbative definition of HI .\nThe adiabatic approximation hinges on the assumption of heavy (m \u2192\n\u221e) partners. This should be reasonable if at least one of the quarks in each\nhadron is heavy, say an s-quark. However, in the chiral limit (m\u03c0 \u2192 0),\nusing Wilson fermions, the adiabatic approximation is expected to fail if\npseudoscalar mesons are involved. In this case momentum space methods\nlike in Sec. 4.4 are preferable. Finally, the quality of the adiabatic approximation can of course be tested numerically by computing off-diagonal\nelements of the correlation matrices.\n\n4.6\n\nAnalysis on a Periodic Lattice\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions across the space extent of the lattice are a\ncommon choice. The potentials V(~r ) and W(~r, ~s ), see (112) and (113),\nextracted from the lattice simulation, in one or the other way, will reflect\nthose conditions. In particular, the maximal usable relative distance r is\nL/2.\nSuppose it is desired to make a fit to the lattice local potential with a\nclass of functions V (\u03b1) (~r ) depending on a set of parameters \u03b1. An example\n\n36\n\n\fis\nV (\u03b1) (~r ) = \u03b11\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b12 r \u03b15\n+ \u03b10 .\n1 + \u03b13 r \u03b15 +1 e\u03b14 r\n\n(131)\n\nThis class (see Fig. 13) has enough flexibility to match heuristic features of\nthe hadronic interaction, like short-range repulsion or attraction as the case\nmay be, and a long range Yukawa form\nV (\u03b1) (~r ) \u2192 \u2212\n\n\u03b11 \u03b12 e\u2212\u03b14 r\n+ \u03b10\n\u03b13\nr\n\nas\n\nr \u2192 \u221e.\n\nThe periodic extension, defined as\nX\n(\u03b1)\nV (\u03b1) (~r \u2212 ~nL) ,\nVL (~r ) =\n\n(132)\n\n(133)\n\n~\nn\n\nwhere ~n are vectors with d whole number components, can then be used to\nfit the lattice potentials with\n\u03c72 (\u03b1) =\n\n1\n1 X\n(\u03b1)\n|V(~r ) \u2212 VL (~r )|2 2\n.\nN\n\u03c3 (~r )\n\n(134)\n\n~\nr\n\nHere the sum runs over the set of N lattice distances ~r for which V(~r ) has\nbeen computed.\nThe idea behind using a periodic extension, like (133), is to account\nfor the fact that the lattice hadrons are interacting with their replicas in\nadjacent copies of the periodic lattice. With \u03c72 minimized, we would take\nV (\u03b1) (~r ) and W (\u03b2) (~r, ~s ) obtained from a similar fit, as the results of the\nsimulation.\n\n5\n\nCurrent State in QCD in 3+1 Dimensions\n\nAt the time of this writing, lattice work on the subject of hadronic interaction is in an exploratory phase. Nevertheless, it is useful to convey what\nhas been done through some selected examples. We will not include in this\nsection results other than QCD3+1 , for example O(4) symmetric field theories and four-fermion models [66, 67, 68], models exploring static quark\ngeometry3 [69, 70], studies with an SU(2) gauge group [71], and work using\nthe hamiltonian lattice formulation [72].\n3\n\nThe contribution by A. M. Green is devoted to this subject.\n\n37\n\n\fFigure 13: Example of V (\u03b1) as defined in (131). The parameters \u03b1 are\narbitrarily chosen, for the purpuse of illustration.\n\n5.1\n\nScattering Lengths for \u03c0 and N Systems\n\nTo date the most elaborate application within QCD3+1 has been via L\u00fcscher's formula (9) by the CP-PACS collaboration aiming at scattering\nlengths for the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0, \u03c0\u2013N, K\u2013N, K\u0304\u2013N, and N\u2013N systems [19, 18, 20, 21,\n22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. The collaboration has applied considerable resources to\nthis problem, recently using lattices as large as L3 \u00d7 T = 323 \u00d7 60 [24].\nHowever, for most of their earlier explorations [21] lattices typically of size\n123 \u00d7 20 with lattice lattice constants in the range of a \u2248 0.15 \u2013 0.30 fm\nwere used.\nExtracting the s-wave scattering length a0 from L\u00fcscher's formula\na0\na0\n2\u03c0(mh1 + mh2 )a0\n[1 + c1 + c2 ( )2 + o(L\u22123 )] ,\nmh 1 mh 2 L3\nL\nL\n(135)\nwhere h1 and h2 denote hadrons 1 and 2, see (9), requires a standard mass\ncalculation on the lattice. One therefore needs to compute correlation functions of suitable operators, say \u03c6h1 (t) and \u03c6h2 (t). For illustration, some\nWh1 h2 \u2212 (mh1 + mh2 ) = \u2212\n\n38\n\n\fexamples using Wilson fermions are\nX\n\u03c6\u03c0+ (t) = \u2212\n\u03c8\u0304dA (~x, t)\u03b35 \u03c8uA (~x, t)\n\n(136)\n\n~\nx\n\n\u0001\n1 X\n\u221a\n\u03c8\u0304uA (~x, t)\u03b35 \u03c8uA (~x, t) \u2212 \u03c8\u0304dA (~x, t)\u03b35 \u03c8dA (~x, t)\n2 ~x\nX\n\u03c6K + (t) =\n\u03c8\u0304sA (~x, t)\u03b35 \u03c8uA (~x, t) ,\n\u03c6\u03c00 (t) =\n\n(137)\n(138)\n\n~\nx\n\netc, where A = 1, 2, 3 represents SU(3) color. Only zero-momentum interpolating fields are needed here. Kogut-Susskind, or staggered, fermions\n[47, 48, 49] were also used by the CP-PACS collaboration. The construction of operators with specific hadron quantum numbers is technically more\ncomplicated, however [73]. The authors of Ref. [21] chose to construct correlation functions where sources and sinks between h1 and h2 are one time\nslice apart. For the one-hadron systems this means\nCh1 (t, 0) = h\u03c6h1 (t)\u03c6\u2020h1 (0)i \u2212 h\u03c6h1 (t)ih\u03c6\u2020h1 (0)i\n\u2243 \u0101h1 e\u2212mh1 t\n\nCh2 (t + 1, 1) = h\u03c6h2 (t + 1)\u03c6\u2020h2 (1)i \u2212 h\u03c6h2 (t + 1)ih\u03c6\u2020h2 (1)i\n\n(139)\n(140)\n\n\u2243 \u0101h2 e\u2212mh2 t ,\n\nwhere \u2243 indicates the asymptotic behavior. The two-hadron interpolating\nfields are constructed from linear combinations of products of one-hadron\noperators, respecting the one-time-slice offset.

Since\na complete solution of\nX\nD(x\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 ) G(x\u2032\u2032 , x) = 1 \u03b4x\u2032 ,x ,\n(149)\nx\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere 1 means the unit matrix in color-Dirac space, is not feasible in practice\nsource techniques are typically used to obtain at least some columns of G.\nThe CP-PACS collaboration has employed so called wall sources. These are\ndefined by placing a point source of value 1 on each spatial site of a certain\ntime slice t, specifically\nX\nX\nD(~x\u2032 t\u2032 , ~x\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 ) Gt (~x\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 ) = 1\n\u03b4(~x\u2032 t\u2032 ),(~xt) = 1 \u03b4t\u2032 t .\n(150)\n~\nx\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032\n\n~\nx\n\n40\n\n\fNote that the uniform nature of the wall source implies that the solution\nvector Gt must be independent of ~x\u2032 . Indeed, employing (149) it is obvious\nthat\nX\nGt (~x\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 ) =\nG(~x\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 , ~xt) .\n(151)\n~\nx\n\nLoosely speaking, since the spatial source is structureless quark propagation to x\u2032\u2032 proceeds in 'the same way' regardless of the spatial point of\norigin. However, this is not a gauge invariant mechanism. Under a gauge\ntransformation D(x, y) = U \u2020 (x)D\u0303(x, y)U (y), etc, the wall source becomes\n1U (~x\u2032 t\u2032 ) \u03b4t\u2032 ,t . Thus, in contrast to G(~x\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 , ~xt), the (numerical) solution\nGt (~x\u2032\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 ) of (150) does not transform covariantly. Gauge dependent noise\nin hadronic correlation functions caused by the wall sources is specifically\ncreated at time slices where two wall sources or one wall source and one\nsink are placed. This can be seen from Fig. 14 which shows a diagramatic\nanalysis of the correlators for the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0, \u03c0\u2013N, and N\u2013N systems in terms\nof quark propagators and the corresponding wall sources and sinks.

The time slices refer\nto t1 = 0, t2 = 1, t3 = t, t4 = t+1. For example the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 rectangular diagram\nin Fig. 14(i) corresponds to\nX\nC R (t4 , t3 , t2 , t1 ) =\nhReTr[G\u2020t1 (~x2 t2 )Gt4 (~x2 t2 )G\u2020t4 (~x3 t3 )Gt1 (~x3 t3 )]i .\n~\nx2 ,~\nx3\n\n(152)\nThe paths involved in the computation of\nare not all closed, they are\ninterupted at time slices where a (nonlocal) wall source meets a (local) sink,\nor two wall sources meet. This happens, for example, at t1 and t4 , see (152)\nand Fig. 14.\nIn order to deal with the gauge noise problem two strategies may be\nemployed: The first one is gauge fixing, the other one is to rely on gauge\nfluctuations to cancel out in the final correlation function. For the latter the\ngauge noise is expected to decrease as \u223c L3/2 for sufficiently large L [21].\nCorrelator ratios (144) for various channels can be expressed in terms of\nlinear combinations of certain diagrams which are referred to by labels D,\nC, R, V, etc, in Fig. 14. For example, in the Wilson fermion scheme\nCR\n\n3\n1\n\u03c0\u03c0\nRI=0\n(t) = RD (t) + RC (t) \u2212 3RR (t) + RV (t)\n2\n2\n\u03c0\u03c0\nRI=2\n(t) = RD (t) \u2212 RC (t) .\n\n(153)\n(154)\n\nFor staggered fermions the corresponding decomposition is slightly different.\nTypical results for a ratio function (144) are shown in Fig. 15 for the\nI = 0 and I = 2 channels of the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 system. A selection of scattering\nlengths, again for the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 system, is displayed in Fig. 16. In Fig. 17 a comparison of scattering lengths for the systems \u03c0\u2013\u03c0, \u03c0\u2013N, and N\u2013N is made.\nTable 1 contains the main results of the lattice simulation and current algebra predictions. A chiral extrapolation has not been made in [21]. Thus,\nperhaps not surprisingly, the lattice results agree best with the current algebra predictions that use the hadron masses supplied by the actual lattice\nsimulation. The N\u2013N system is special because of its large size.

In a system of two mesons which consist of a heavy and a light\nquark each, we may still approximate the heavy quark by a Polyakov loop,\nas above. The role of the static quarks then is to localize the mesons. This\nsituation suggests using the coordinate-space approach of Sec. 4.5.\nThus we take, say in the staggered scheme,\n\u03c6~x (t) = \u03c7\u0304h (~x, t) \u03c7u (~x, t) ,\n\n(159)\n\nwhere h is the heavy flavor 1(h = s, c, . . .). The two-meson1 interpolating\nfield is defined just like (115). However, the heavy-flavor propagator, G(h) ,\n46\n\n\fis taken in the limit mh \u2192 \u221e. This is achieved by using the hopping\nparameter expansion [83, 77] and keeping the leading term only.

Those data points are slightly shifted\n[84].\n\n48\n\n\fIn the simple case of a one-hadron local operator it is possible to express\nthe corresponding time correlation function in terms of propagator matrix\nelements from a source located at only one fixed lattice site, say x = (~x0 t0 ).\nThis is done by using translational invariance of the lattice action in the manner outlined in Sec. 3.2 leading to (40), for example. The cost of computing\nthis is greatly reduced because only one column G(~xt, ~x0 t0 ) of the inverse\nfermion matrix (per color-Dirac index) is needed. In the case of a two-hadron\nsystem translational invariance might still be utilized to replace some propagator elements with G(~xt, ~x0 t0 ), for example via ~x1 \u2192 ~x1 + ~y1 \u2212 ~x0 in (42).\nIn the latter case elements G(~xt, ~y t0 ) where ~x and ~y run separately over all\nspatial lattice sites still remain. Those are known as all-to-all propagators.\nTheir computation poses an almost unavoidable problem in multi-hadron\nsystems. The wall sources defined through (150) seemingly circumvent this\ndifficulty, however, only at the cost of violating gauge invariance of the correlation functions, see Sec. 5.1. In a heavy-light hadron-hadron system, like\n(162) for example, the needed minimum number of sources is the number of\nrelative spatial distances distances ~r that are probed (including those related\nby O(3, Z) symmetry).\nThe use of stochastic methods for dealing with the all-to-all propagator\nproblem was already discussed in some detail. Even in cases where translational invariance can be utilized it may be advantageous to employ random\nsources instead. The reason is that the additional (large) sums over lattice\nsites work to reduce statistical errors in the correlation functions. Besides,\nit may also be the only computationally viable strategy. In a typical application a random source is chosen to be nonzero on one time slice only, say\nt0 , as in (65) and (66). In this case propagation from any lattice site to any\nother lattice site within the same time slice is computed using the stochastic\nestimator, whereas propagation between lattice sites with different times,\nsuch as t and t0 , is computed with machine precision. An important consequence is that the errors for propagation in space and time directions are\ndifferent. While the latter is as small as the matrix inversion algorithm permits (e.g. a conjugate gradient) the former is limited by the variance of the\nrandom source probability distribution and, in particular, is independent of\nthe distance between the lattice sites. This is a serious drawback, it means\nthat stochastic estimation is futile in computing the usual (hadronic) time\ncorrelation functions since their exponentially decreasing signal would be\nconcealed by the essentially constant error of the stochastic estimator.\nThis problem can be dealt with to some extent by a method called maximum variance reduction [85], see also [86, 87]. The idea is to enclose disjoint\nregions of lattice sites by fixed-source boundaries in order to increase sample\n49\n\n\fsizes. One such region may consist of a single point [88]. Another, somewhat\nrelated, example is R = {(~x, t0 )|~x \u2208 L3 }, i.e. the spatial volume at time slice\nt0 . An estimator for propagation between any two points in disjoint regions\nis then variance reduced. Specifically, starting from\nZ\n1\nZ = [d\u03c6 d\u03c6\u2217 ] exp(\u2212 \u03c6\u2020 A\u03c6) ,\n(165)\n2\nwhere \u03c6 is an auxiliary scalar complex lattice field and A is a hermitean\npositive definite matrix, one may generate stochastically independent ensembles of fields {\u03c6} by way of common Monte Carlo methods with the\ngaussian probability distribution implied in (165). Writing i = C\u03bcx, etc, for\nthe color-Dirac-site indices it is then straightforward to show that\nZ\n1\n1\n\u22121\n(166)\n[d\u03c6 d\u03c6\u2217 ] exp(\u2212 \u03c6\u2020 A\u03c6) \u03c6\u2217j \u03c6i \u223c\nAij =\n= h\u03c6\u2217j \u03c6i i ,\nZ\n2\nwhere in this context h. . .i means the average over the ensemble {\u03c6}. The\nabove equations become useful for the choice\nA = Q\u2020 Q ,\n\n(167)\n\nwith Q = Q[U ] being the fermion matrix for a given gauge field configuration\nU . In the Wilson scheme, for example, it has the form Q[U ] = 1 \u2212 \u03baD[U ].\nQuark propagator elements Gij can then be estimated from the ensemble\naverages\ndef\n\u2217\n\u223c\nGij = Q\u22121\n(168)\nij = h(Q\u03c6)j \u03c6i i .\np\nIf the variance of the above estimator is \u03c3ij the statistical error is \u03c3ij / N\u03c6\nfor an ensemble of size N\u03c6 .5 However, the crucial point here is that the\nvariance \u03c3ij , for i = C\u03bcx and j = B\u03bdy, is essentially independent of the\nspace-time distance |x \u2212 y|, say \u03c3ij \u2248 \u03c3 while \u03c3 is of the order of one inherited from its gaussian ancestry. This effect spoils using the stochastic\nestimator for the purpose of computing exponentially decreasing time correlation functions.\nTo alleviate the problem the authors of Ref. [85] proceed to consider a\nsubset, or region, of contiguous lattice sites. Describe this region by sets of\nsites R and S, with R \u2229 S = \u2205, where R contains all entirely interior points\n\n5\nIn fact, since a new estimator is computed for each of the gauge field configurations in\nthe lattice simulation, the resulting error of a hadronic time correlation function is much\nsmaller. For this reason a value of N\u03c6 that is about 1/10 \u2013 1/20 of the number of gauge\nfield configurations is usually sufficient.\n\n50\n\n\f(having 8 neighbors \u2208 R \u222a S) and S is the boundary (having 1 through 7\nneighbors \u2208 R \u222a S). In the process of generating ensembles {\u03c6} from (165),\nconsider a certain field \u03c6. Then, the field conponents on the boundary S\nare kept fixed\ndef\nsl = \u03c6l for l \u2208 S ,\n(169)\nand instead of (165) one uses\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\nZ = [d\u03c6 d\u03c6\u2217 ] exp \u2212 (\u03c6\u2020i \u0100ij \u03c6j + \u03c6\u2020i \u00c3il sl + s\u2020l \u00c3lj \u03c6j ) ,\n2\nR\n\n(170)\n\nwhere i, j \u2208 R and l \u2208 S is understood for the index sum ranges and the\nnotations \u0100 and \u00c3 are introduced for the corresponding blocks of A. The\nintegral runs over the field components located on R. Now the R-averaged\nrandom source field\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1 \u2020\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2217\n[d\u03c6 d\u03c6 ] exp \u2212 (\u03c6i \u0100ij \u03c6j + \u03c6i \u00c3il sl + sl \u00c3lj \u03c6j ) \u03c6k ,\n(171)\nvk =\nZ R\n2\nwith k \u2208 R, is called the variance reduced estimator for \u03c6. Evaluation of\nthe gaussian integral in (171) gives\nvk = \u2212\u0100\u22121\nki \u00c3il sl .\n\n(172)\n\nRecall that in (168) single-site components of the random source field\n\u03c6 are employed to estimate the quark propagator. Replacing those with\nsite-averaged variance reduced estimators v essentially amounts to using\nextended sources which of course reduce fluctuations. This is the main idea.\nTo obtain a variance reduced estimator for quark propagator elements two\ndisjoint regions R and R\u2032 are needed. Then, within the above framework,\none may use (168) to show that\nGk\u2032 k \u2243 h(Qv)\u2217k vk\u2032 \u2032 i for\n\nk \u2208 R, k\u2032 \u2208 R\u2032 ,\n\n(173)\n\nwhere v and v \u2032 are the variance reduced sources corresponding to the regions\nR and R\u2032 respectively [87]. Clearly, only propagator elements between any\nsite in R and any site in R\u2032 can obtained in this way. Thus the all-toall propagator problem is only partially solved. In order to maximize the\nvariance reduction effect, R and R\u2032 should be equal in size and together with\nS and S \u2032 cover the entire lattice. This suggests the choices of all lattice sites\nwith 0 < t < T /2 and T /2 < t < T for R and R\u2032 , respectively. Further\ncomputational and technical details for the practitioner are given in Ref. [85].\n51\n\n\fMichael and Pennanen have utilized maximal variance reduced estimators in their work on heavy-light meson-meson systems [34] using improved\nWilson fermions with a Sheikholeslami-Wohlert action [43]. Their main motivation was to explore the possibility of binding heavy-light systems. Since\nthe kinetic energy of the quarks has a repulsive effect at shorter relative\ndistances two hadrons containing a heavy quark each should have a better\nchance of forming a bound state. Concerning experiment, the simulation\nis expected to describe mesons with one (heavy) b-quark flavor. Using the\nstatic limit for the heavy flavor has the consequence that heavy-light pseudoscalar and vector mesons (B and B\u2217 respectively) are degenerate. However, experimentally their mass difference is less that 0.9% of the groundstate B-meson mass [89], so the static approximation is quite reasonable.\nThe notation B is used in in Ref. [34] to refer to the degenerate heavy-light\nmesons. For the light quarks u and d flavors are employed, the corresponding Wilson hopping parameter \u03ba puts their masses in the neighborhood of\nthe strange quark mass.\nThus a B\u2013B system with relative distance r between the (static) quarks\nis classified in terms of the total spin Sq and isospin Iq of the light quarks,\nwhile imposing the usual particle exchange symmetries through appropriate\nheavy quark total spin Sb and spatial symmetries. The latter states are\ndegenerate in the static quark limit. In the limit of an isotropic spatial\nwavefunction (L=0) there are only four degenerate ground state levels of\nthe B\u2013B system characterized by Iq = 0, 1 and Sq = 0, 1. The situation is\nillustrated in Table 2.\nTable 2: Allowed B\u2013B states with L = 0 according to [34]. Total isospin\nand spin of the light-quark subsystem are denoted by Iq and Sq , respectively.\nThe total spin Sb of the heavy quarks only distinguishes degenerate states.\nAlso shown are the physical heavy-light systems and their J P coupling to\nthese states.\nIq\nSq\nSb\nJP\nBB BB\u2217\nB\u2217 B\u2217\n1\n1\n1\n0+\nX\nX\n1\n1\n1\n1+\nX\n1\n1\n1\n2+\nX\n1\n0\n0\n0+\nX\nX\n0\n1\n0\n1+\nX\nX\n0\n0\n1\n1+\nX\nX\nSelected results of the simulation [34] are shown in Fig. 21 exhibiting\n52\n\n\fthe energies of the B\u2013B system at fixed separation r of the static b-quarks.\nThe authors suggest that there is evidence for deep binding at small r with\na light di-quark configuration having (Iq , Sq ) = (0, 0) and (1, 1) respectively.\nThis binding energy is 400 \u2013 200 MeV at r = 0 but is very short-ranged. It\nis essentially a gluonic effect and is rather insensitive to the light quark mass\nas shown by studies of static baryons with varying light quark masses [85].\nPossibly, a configuration where the color of two heavy quarks combines to a\ncolor state symmetric under particle exchange (sextet) provides the interaction mechanism here. This situation is particular to relative distance r = 0\nsince two-quark color states other than local singlets are not suppressed by\nconfinement dynamics.\n\nFigure 21: Results for the binding energy E(B\u2013B) \u2212 2E(B) between two B\nmesons with light quarks in (Iq , Sq ) = (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1) at separation\nR (called r throughout this chapter) in units of R0 \u2248 0.5 fm. The light\nquark mass used corresponds to strange quarks. Results at different spatial\nlattice sizes are displaced in R for legibility [34].\n\n53\n\n\fAt larger r, around 0.5 fm, evidence is seen for weak binding when\nthe light quarks are in the (Iq , Sq ) = (0, 1) and (1, 0) states. This can be\nrelated to meson exchange and one finds evidence of an interaction in the\nspin-dependent quark-exchange (cross) diagram which is compatible with\nthe theoretical contribution from pion exchange in the study. Using lighter,\nmore physical, light quark masses below the strange quark mass and, most\ndesirably a chiral extrapolation, will be necessary to confirm this interaction\nmechanism.\n\n5.4\n\nMomentum-Space Work on the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 System\n\nThe calculation of euclidean correlation functions between different hadrons\nin the incoming and outgoing channel, like K\u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays, has to be treated\nwith caution [90]. The program laid out in Secs. 3.2\u20133.5 and 4.4 has been\nput to the test in QCD3+1 for a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 system of Wilson fermions [82]. The\nformalism is essentially unchanged, except for the appearance of color indices\non the link variables U\u03bc (x) \u2208 SU(3) and, replacing staggered with Wilson\nfermions, the appearance of both a color A, B . . . = 1, 2, 3 and a Dirac\n\u03bc, \u03bd . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4 index on the Grassmann quark fields \u03c8f A\u03bc (x). In addition,\nthere is a rather technical, but important point:\nA technique known as 'smearing' uses spatially extended field operators.\nFor example, omitting flavor and Dirac indices for the moment, define the\nquark field recursively\nXX\n{k\u22121}\n{k}\n{0}\n(~y t) , (174)\nKAB (~x, ~y ) \u03c8B\n\u03c8A (~xt) =\n\u03c8A (~xt) = \u03c8A (x)\ny\n~\n\nB\n\nwith k \u2208 N, and the matrix\nKAB (~x, ~y ) = \u03b4AB \u03b4~x,~y + \u03b1HAB (~x, ~y )\n3 h\ni\nX\n\u2020\nUm,AB (~x t)\u03b4~x,~y\u2212m\u0302 + Um,AB\n(~y t)\u03b4~x,~y+m\u0302\nHAB (~x, ~y ) =\n\n(175)\n(176)\n\nm=1\n\nconnecting (hopping) to next-neighbor sites. With this particular choice of\nthe matrix K the procedure is known as Gaussian smearing [91]. The real\nnumber \u03b1 and the maximal value for k are considered parameters. The advantage of smearing lies in the fact that interpolating operators constructed\nwith smeared fields often have a larger overlap with the ground state of the\nhadron in question, see Fig. 22. The signal from the corresponding correlator is less contaminated by fluctuations from excited states and thus masses\n54\n\n\fcan be extracted from shorter euclidean time extents. This leads to better\nstatistics and is often crucial for the numerical work.

The final interaction potential is shown in Figs. 26(a) and (c) for mf =\n100 MeV and mf = 500 MeV, respectively. The fits of the periodic potential\nwere stable for the data with mf = 100 MeV. The data for mf = 500 MeV\nsuffer from very small energy differences which makes a fit unreliable. The\npotentials exhibit attraction at intermediate range and may have a repulsive\nbehavior at short distances. The potential at mf = 500 MeV is compatible\nwith zero interaction. The analytic form (131) of the interaction potential\nwas used as an input to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a phase shift calculation\naccording to scattering theory [36]. The resulting phase shifts are displayed\nin Figs. 26(b) and (d) for different values of the meson mass parameter used\nin the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nOne aim of this study was the comparison of results obtained from lattice\nQCD with results calculated from inverse scattering theory. There is a\nwealth of inversion results from hadron-hadron scattering [104]. We here\nrestrict ourselves to cases with partial wave L = 0 meson-meson scattering.\nThe basis for any inversion is the existence of experimental data which,\nafter a suitable interpolation and extrapolation, leads to a solution of the\nunderlying ill-posed problem. For the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 system the experimental situation\nis acceptable. The main source of experimental information for the inversion\nprocedure is the analysis of the CERN\u2013Munich experiment \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + n\n[101, 97, 105]. Even though there are ambiguities in the analysis of the \u03c0\u03c0\nfinal state, all phase shift analyses reach comparable results, which can be\ndescribed by both meson exchange [8] and chiral perturbation theory (\u03c7PT)\n[98, 99]. This experimental situation is depicted in Fig. 26(f). The inversion\nresults for several sources of phase shifts are shown in Fig. 26(e). While the\nisospin I = 2 channel is purely repulsive, the isospin I = 0 channel shows\nan attractive component. A resonance is supported in this channel [104].\nThe lattice mesons are coupled to isospin I = 2 but constructed without\na specific angular momentum projection. Thus there is no one-to-one correspondence between the quantum numbers of the lattice mesons and the\nexperimental data. The lattice potentials in Figs. 26(a) and (c) are attractive with repulsion at short distances, whereas the potentials obtained from\ninverse scattering in Fig. 26(e) are only repulsive. This is expressed in the\ndifferent form of the phase shifts in Fig. 26(f) compared with those from\nthe lattice QCD calculations in Figs. 26(b) and (d). One reason might be\nthe incomplete projection to the correct quantum numbers. The construction of good quantum numbers is not straightforward in the Kogut-Susskind\n60\n\n\fscheme. It is easier with the Wilson fermions but leads to extra terms in\nthe correlator which have to be resolved numerically (see Appendix 7).\nTo summarize Secs. 5.4 and 5.5, we have performed two analyses partly\nin the same line both aiming at the extraction of a pion\u2013pion potential from\nlattice QCD. The computation within staggered quarks suffered from the\nconstruction of spin observables whereas the more sophisticated calculation\nwith Wilson fermions introduced a somewhat arbitrary cutoff at short distances. As a general conclusion the reader has seen the current state of\nthese trials which he might judge to be qualitative. Not only the increase\nof computer power but the efforts of physicists can make the results more\naccurate to compare with and predict experiments.\n\n61\n\n\f50\n120\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n90\n\u03b40 [degrees]\n\nV(r) [MeV]\n\n0\n\nmf = 100 MeV\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\np+1 \u03bcr\n\np\n\nV(r) = A(1-Br )/(1+Cr\n\n-150\n\ne )\n\n60\n30\n0\n-30\n\nA = 3.01, B = 111.66,\nC = 0.04, p = 1, \u03bc = 5.47\n\n2m = 1.0 GeV\n2m = 2.0 GeV\n2m = 4.0 GeV\n\n-60\n-200\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\nr [fm]\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n60\n(c)\n\n(d)\n45\n\n\u03b40 [degrees]\n\n0\n\nmf = 500 MeV\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\nV(r) = A(1-Brp)/(1+Crp+1e\u03bcr)\n\n-150\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n2m = 1.0 GeV\n2m = 2.0 GeV\n2m = 4.0 GeV\n\n30\n15\n0\n\nA = 79.97, B = 10.25,\nC = 54.61, p = 1, \u03bc = 1.17\n\n-15\n\n-200\n\n-30\n0.0\n\n3\n\n0.1\n\nr [fm]\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\np [GeV/c]\n\n200\n\n125\n(e)\n\n(f)\n100\n\n2\n\n100\n\nV0\n\u03b4 [degrees]\n\n75\nV(r) [GeV]\n\n0.4\n\np [GeV/c]\n\n50\n\nV(r) [MeV]\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n25\n\n0\n\nV0\n-200\n\n-300\n0.0\n\n0\n\n\u03b40\n50\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n-25\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nr [fm]\n\n2\n\n\u03b40\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\np [GeV/c]\n\n*\nFigure 26: (a)\u2013(d): Lattice results for meson-meson interaction potentials\nV (r) after the subtraction of the effects of the mirror particles, and phase\nshifts \u03b4, for quark masses mf = 100 MeV and mf = 500 MeV.

From a modern perspective its primary goal now is the understanding\nof hadronic phenomena in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom of\nthe underlying theory, quantum chromodynamics [106]. Historically, phenomenological descriptions of hadron-hadron interactions have been with us\nfor more than six decades while new questions related to the quark-gluon\nstructure of hadrons have emerged as our insight has deepened over time.\nThus hadronic physics now is closely intertwined with QCD. Dramatic advances in computational technology, lattice field theory, and algorithms of\ncomputational physics, have moved unprecedented opportunities for fundamental cognition within our reach. New accelerators and advanced detector\ndesign should of course also be mentioned in this context. Among the many\ntopics tackled by lattice QCD \u2013 the hadron mass spectrum, hadronic structure, heavy flavor and exotic hadrons, to name just a few \u2013 the physics of\nhadron-hadron interactions is one of the more challenging subjects.\nIt is thus not surprising that the topic of this chapter is only in a nascent\nstate. Concluding words with a quality of closure would be truly misleading.\nThe current stage of hadron-hadron interactions on the lattice is driven by\nthe tools of lattice technology with mass calculations being directly accessible from the euclidean formulation. All methods discussed in this chapter\nessentially use the energy spectra of certain systems as a starting point.\nThree ways to utilize those have been visited: finite volume methods and\ndirect calculation of scattering phase shifts (L\u00fcscher's method), construction\nof an effective interaction from two-hadron states (perturbative potentials),\nand direct computation of the interaction in heavy-light systems (adiabatic\npotential).\nOf those methods the first one addresses measurable data directly, so\nfar its most prominent application being aimed at scattering lengths. The\nother variants leave the realm of field theory in the hope of unveiling physical mechanisms of the interaction. Perhaps, in the latter case the usual\nlattice technology constraints (related to chiral symmetry, quark masses, finite volume, continuum limit, etc) are a lesser impediment to progress in\nthe sense that qualitative insights into the physics of the interaction can still\nbe gained with 'less than perfect' lattice parameters.\nPrecision simulations reproducing experimental scattering data should\nprobably not be the first priority at this time. To achieve this the field may\nnot be advanced enough, particularly in the nucleon-nucleon case. Also,\nfermion methods dealing properly with chiral symmetry [107] should cer63\n\n\ftainly be incorporated.\nUnderstanding hadronic interaction mechanisms, for example the importance of gluon or quark degrees of freedom at certain relative distances, is\nprobably more desirable at this stage. Emphasizing this aspect in future\nstudies, for example heavy-light meson-baryon and baryon-baryon systems,\nseems a promising line of work that should shed some light on the QCD\naspects of the hadron-hadron interaction. A related aspect is understanding\nof the origin of effective field theories [108].\nFrom the viewpoint of lattice technology the computation of multi-quark\ncorrelation functions, which requires all-to-all fermion propagators, is certainly the biggest problem. Considerable space was devoted to random\nsource methods. Those are likely to remain pillars of hadron-hadron systems simulations. In another development, not mentioned before, Baysian\nanalysis methods for lattice generated time correlation functions promise\naccess to excited states [109, 110, 111], an aspect crucial for the topic of this\nchapter.\nFinally, although it is true that the euclidean formulation of lattice QCD\nin imaginary time currently dominates the field, one should realize that it\nmay not be the framework best suited to the task. It is not clear how to\novercome the difficulty of describing asymptotic states, in the sense of LSZ\nscattering formalism, other than trying to solve the problem via spectrum\ncomputations at multiple lattice volumes [112]. In the context of scattering\nthe alternative hamiltonian formulation in real time is largely unexplored\n[72].\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a great pleasure to acknowledge the many significant contributions of\n(in alphabetical order) J.

Wilson fermions are computationally more demanding than staggered fermions. While Wilson fermions explicitly break chiral\nsymmetry, though they have a chiral limit which in practice can be recovered via a m2\u03c0 \u2192 0 extrapolation of observables, staggered fermions retain\na discrete remnant of chiral symmetry [115]. In the Wilson scheme construction of interpolating fields for hadrons with definite quantum numbers\nis transparent, and works more or less like in the continuum theory. This\nis opposite for staggered fermions, which entail complicated mathematics\nwhen constructing interpolating fields [49, 115, 73].\nA case in point is an ordinary \u03c0 + interpolating field. First, the quark\nfields, qf , are nonlocal operators which live on elementary hypercubes of the\nlattice [115, 114]. For a U(1) gauge model (no colors) we have\nX\n\u0393\u03b7 U (\u03b7, x)\u03c7f (2x + \u03b7)\n(A.1)\nqf (x) = C \u22123/2\n\u03b7\n\nbuilt from the staggered fields \u03c7f . The sum is over the set of the ddimensional vectors \u03b7 that point to the corners of the hypercube, \u03b7\u03bc = 0, 1\nfor \u03bc = 1 . . . d, with d = 4, see Ref. [114] for an odd number of dimensions.\nFurther\n\u03b7\n\n\u0393\u03b7 = \u03b31 \u03bc . . . \u03b3d\u03b7d\n\nand U (\u03b7, x) = [U1 (2x)]\u03b71 . . .

The idea is to cancel discretization errors through adding additional, carefully tuned, terms to the lattice action. Quantum effects (radiative corrections) play an important role in their construction. Symanzik's\nimprovement program has received considerable attention [118, 119, 120,\n121, 122] since its inception, but has only recently evolved into a form which\nis finding widespread application through the work of Lepage and Mackenzie [38]. Through a combination of beyond-elementary geometric structures\nin the lattice action and accounting for part of the quantum fluctuations\nthrough numerically self-consistent renormalization lattice simulations now\noperate considerably closer to the continuum limit than ever before. With\nimproved lattice actions results which can be compared to experiment are\nnow within reach in many cases. With regard to the current topic (hadronic\ninteraction) improved actions are important because they allow us to use\nlarge lattices, say L \u2248 4 fm or so, with relatively moderate computing facilities.\nImprovement of the Lepage-Mackenzie flavor has been well publicized\n[42]. Educational articles (for beginners) detailing the basics, ramifications,\nand physical significance of this development have been written by its originators [123, 124]. There is no point in duplicating those writings. However,\ngiven the importance of large lattices for hadronic interactions it is appropriate to devote at least an appendix to the basics of this development. We\nwill do so by way of selected examples.\n\n8.1\n\nAppendix B.1: A Scalar Example\n\nIn the lattice discretization of the space-time continuum derivatives are approximated by finite differences. For example, considering a scalar field\ntheory,\nX \u03c6(x + a\u03bc\u0302) + \u03c6(x \u2212 a\u03bc\u0302) \u2212 2\u03c6(x)\n.\n(B.1)\n\u2202 2 \u03c6(x) \u2248\na2\n\u03bc\nIn the classical limit, this approximation is 'good' if \u03c6(x) is smooth on a scale\nlarger than the lattice constant a. We may give a more precise meaning to\nthis statement by saying that the Fourier transform\nZ\n\u22122\n\u03c6\u0303(p) = (2\u03c0)\nd4 x eip*x \u03c6(x)\n(B.2)\n\n67\n\n\fis zero (within some bound \u01eb) for momenta |p| > \u03c0/a. The error of the\nfinite-difference approximation (B.1) is o(a2 ), as a Taylor expansion shows.\nIn fact we may systematically improve upon the classical discretization by\nincluding next-nearest-neighbor finite differences.

Also, it is straightforward to generalize\nthe expansions to higher orders in a in a systematic way. Thus the continuum\naction, say for a scalar Klein-Gordon field with quartic self interaction\nZ\n1\n1\ng\nS[\u03c6] = d4 x[\u2212 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + m2 \u03c62 + \u03c64 ]\n(B.12)\n2\n2\n4!\n68\n\n\fmay then be discretized, alternatively, as\n\"\n\u00132\n\u0012\nX\n1X\n1 2 (1) (2)\n4\n(1)\n\u2212\nS[\u03c6] \u2248\n\u03b2a\n\u2206\u03bc \u03c6(x) \u2212 a \u2206\u03bc \u2206\u03bc \u03c6(x)\n2 \u03bc\n6\nx\n\u0015\ng\n1\n(B.13)\n+ m2 \u03c62 (x) + \u03c64 (x) ,\n2\n4!\nor\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n1X\n4 (2) 1 (1)2\n4\n\u2212\nS[\u03c6] \u2248\n\u03b2a\n\u03c6(x)\n\u2206 \u2212 \u2206\u03bc\n\u03c6(x)\n2 \u03bc\n3 \u03bc\n3\nx\n\u0015\n1 2 2\ng 4\n+ m \u03c6 (x) + \u03c6 (x) .\n(B.14)\n2\n4!\nThe above lattice actions are equivalent up to o(a4 ). Evidently the advantage of o(a4 ) improvement is that one works close to the continuum limit\n(a \u2192 0), or from a numerical point of view, at the same 'closeness' to the\ncontinuum theory on can afford a coarser (larger a) lattice which translates\ninto less computational cost.\nSince a classical field \u03c6(x) is smooth on some scale, say a, improvement\nshould be expected to work at some level of accuracy.\nHowever, upon quantizing the theory, smoothness of the field is lost. In\nthe generating functional\nZ\nZ[J] = [d\u03c6] e\u2212S[\u03c6]+J*\u03c6\n(B.15)\n\u03c6(x) and \u03c6(y) are independent integration variables for x 6= y even if x\nand y are infinitesimally close. At a given scale, say a, those fluctuations\n|\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(y)| can in principle be large for |x \u2212 y| \u226a a. Their importance\nis determined by the Boltzmann weight in the euclidean path integral. In a\nmanner of speaking we say that the quantum fields are rough on any scale,\nsee Fig. 27.\nThis means that the Fourier transform (B.2) is unbounded and, generally\nspeaking, momentum-space integrals diverge. The well-known solution is\nrenormalization. In a nutshell, introducing a momentum cutoff \u039b, which\nmakes the momentum-space integrals finite, then renormalizing the fields\n\u03c6(x) = Z\u039b\u22121 \u03c6\u039b (x) ,\n\n(B.16)\n\ncouplings, etc, and, at the level of physical quantities (observables) removing\nthe cutoff \u039b, becomes an integral part of the quantum field theory considered.\n69\n\n\f\u03c6 (x)\n\nx\na\n\n2a\n\nFigure 27: Roughness of the quantum field on any scale. The smooth curve\nillustrates a Fourier average with a finite momentum cutoff \u039b.\nClearly, lattice discretization introduces a natural cutoff momentum\n\u039b=\n\n\u03c0\n.\na\n\n(B.17)\n\nIn a way, the roughness of the fields at scales less than the lattice constant a is\nrendered harmless at the expense of introducing renormalization. (One may\nthink of Z\u039b , for example, as playing a role similar to a dielectric constant \u03bae\nfor a medium of electric dipoles. The small-scale fluctuations of the electric\nfield on the scale of the dipoles are lumped into \u03bae .)\nThe field renormalization constant is without consequence in the present\nexample because it can be made to disappear by changing integration variables \u03c6(x) \u2192 \u03c6\u039b (x) in the generating functional (B.15). Thus\nZ\nZ[J\u039b ] = const [d\u03c6\u039b ] e\u2212S\u039b [\u03c6\u039b ]+J\u039b *\u03c6\u039b ,\n(B.18)\nwhere, S\u039b is the same as (B.13, B.14) except that \u03b2\u039b = \u03b2Z\u039b\u22122 and g\u039b =\ngZ\u039b\u22124 . Improvement does not change the physics of the quantum theory in\nthis particular example of the scalar interacting Klein-Gordon field.\nThis culture of thinking has, perhaps, impeded a much earlier discovery\nof the type of improvement now routinely used in lattice gauge simulations.\nThe above line of thought does lead to a genuinely different situation in the\ncase of gauge theories.\n\n70\n\n\f8.2\n\nAppendix B.2: Improvement of a Pure Gauge Theory\n\nWe start from the Schwinger representation [125] of the (lattice) link variables\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z a\nd\u03be A\u03bc (x + \u03be \u03bc\u0302) ,\n(B.19)\nU\u03bc (x) = P exp ig\n0\n\nwhere P denotes path ordering.

In Fig. 29 for\nexample, are shown the lattice averages of the 4-link plaquette and the\nplanar 6-link rectangle. The deviations from one are sizeable and increase if\nthe gauge field coupling (g 2 \u221d \u03b2 \u22121 ) is made larger. This effect is, of course,\ndue to quantum fluctuations. Its significance is that\n\u2022 Quantum fluctuations spoil the classical continuum limit.\nAgain, the standard procedure to deal with short-ranged (ultraviolet) fluctuations is renormalization. An ultraviolet momentum cutoff is in place\nthrough lattice discretization. The gauge fields are represented by the link\nvariables (B.19), thus replace\nU\u03bc (x) \u2192 u\u22121 U\u03bc (x)\n\n(B.34)\n\nwhere u is a renormalization constant. Note that without the 6-link terms\nin the action SG [U ], see (B.29), the factor u would just renormalize the\n73\n\n\fFigure 29: Expectation values of the 6-link plaquette (planar rectangle), the\n4-link (elementary) plaquette, and the corresponding tadpole renormalization factor u for versus \u03b2.\ngauge field coupling, and be harmless (and useless) very much like in the\nexample of Sec. 8.1. Link variable renormalization does not do anything\nif only the standard Wilson action is used. The crucial point here is that\nthe 6-link improvement terms in the action carry two more factors of link\nvariables. Their fluctuations (in the mean-field sense) can be divided out by\ntwo renormalization factors. Hence, using\nC2 = \u2212\n\n1\n20u2\n\n(B.35)\n\nin the action results in the cancellation of the o(a6 ) terms, as above, between\nthe 4-link and 6-link terms in the action.\n\u2022 Classical improvement and gauge link renormalization conspire to cancel discretization errors in the quantized lattice field theory.\nThis state of affairs is characteristic for a gauge theory. In the lingo of\nperturbation theory the classical limit is known as the tree-level approximation, because no loop diagrams are taken into account. The renormalization\n74\n\n\ffactor u comprises the effect of so-called tadpole diagrams, which are singlyattached loops to the gluon propagator.\nTo be sure, there are radiative corrections to the gluon propagator which\nare not contained in the tadpole diagrams. Some of those induce o(a2 )\ncorrections \u221d \u03b1s (\u03c0/a) and, containing loops, are harder to come by [122, 41].\nThe tadpole factor, on the other hand, can be monitored during an actual\nsimulation. Starting with an arbitrary value, say u = 1, after a number of\niterations we simple 'measure' the elementary plaquette (for example) and\nredefine\n1 X X (1\u00d71) 1/4\nu=h 3\nP\ni .\n(B.36)\n6L T x \u03bc<\u03bd \u03bc\u03bd\nThe new value is then used in the action SG [U ] and the iterations continue.\nAnother u is then 'measured' with the new action, and so on. In this way\nthe\n\u2022 tadpole renormalization factor is determined self consistently during\nthe simulation.\nNumerical work has shown that tree-level and tadpole improvement\n(even without loop corrections) already account for much of the discretization errors [45, 46]. The effect of improvement is quite dramatic. A wellknown example [124] is the restoration of rotational invariance of the static\nquark-antiquark potential, usually parametrized as V (r) = Kr \u2212\u221a\u03c0/12r\n\u221a +\u221aC.\nOn-axis distances r/a = 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . and off-axis distances r/a = 2, 3, 5 . . .,\nwhich are supposed to fall on a smooth curve V (r), are off by as much as\n38%. With a tree-level and tadpole improved action errors are reduced to\nthe one-percent level!\nImprovement schemes are not unique. Various loop geometries (bent,\ntwisted rectangles, etc) may be used to cancel discretization errors. A corresponding statement of course holds for improving the fermionic part of the\naction.\n\n8.3\n\nAppendix B.3: Improvement of a Fermionic Action\n\nA simple fermion action, which is improved up to the same order as the\ngauge field action, can be constructed by employing next-nearest-neighbor\n\n75\n\n\fterms [126, 44, 127].

Thus, in the continuum limit, the bare fermion mass is mf =\n(c0 \u2212 8c\u2032 r)/2c\u2032 a. The choice\nr=1\n(B.47)\nfor the Wilson parameter takes care of the doubling problem (violating chiral\nsymmetry).

The filled circles are the\nenergies of a pseudoscalar meson with momentum p from a 53 \u00d7 7 lattice\nat \u03b2 = 5.0. The data are close to a smooth (fitted) curve, as opposed to\nthe open circles, which are from the standard lattice dispersion relation for\nbosons [83].\n\nFigure 30: Energy-momentum relation for a pseudoscalar meson obtained\nfrom a lattice simulation with the improved action (filled circles), and a\nfitted curve. Also shown are the unimproved lattice dispersion relation for\na free Bose field [83], and the continuum relation.\nAnother example of 'closeness to the continuum' achievable with improved lattice actions is shown in Fig. 31. The nucleon-rho mass ratio is\nplotted versus the rho mass. Open plot symbols correspond to the standard,\nunimproved, Wilson action (gauge and fermion fields). The filled symbols\nrefer to various 'flavors' of improved actions. The experimental value of\nmN /m\u03c1 is 1.22. The two curves in Fig. 31, meant to 'guide the eye', illustrate dramatically the 'quantum leap' provided to us by improved actions:\n78\n\n\fPhysical results, close to the continuum limit, can be obtained from simulations on relatively coarse lattices with lattice constants a about a factor of\n\u2248 4 larger compared to the standard Wilson action. Systematic errors still\nare large though, at this time.\n\nFigure 31: Nucleon \u03c1-meson mass ratio versus the lattice constant a. The\nscale for a was obtained from M\u03c1 = 770 MeV. See Ref. [128, 129, 130] to\ntrace the references for the data points.\nThe lattice actions discussed in Secs. 8.2 and 8.3 are improved up to two\nleading orders in the lattice constant. Those actions are commonly referred\nto as o(a2 ) improved, or highly improved actions. It should be mentioned\nthat highly improved actions are not without problems. The dispersion\nfunction E(p) for free massless quarks, as calculated from the zeros of the\ninverse lattice propagator, exhibit unphysical branches that describe additional particles, or ghosts. Hopefully their masses are sufficiently large, so as\nnot to interfere with the propagation of the physical quarks on the lattice.\nThe effect of those particles reveals itself in the early-time-slice behaviour of\nhadronic correlation functions. Thus, in practice, their effect can be isolated\nand hardly poses a problem.\nA class of highly improved actions that has received much attention\n79\n\n\frecently is known as D234 actions, the nomenclature taken from the way\nderivative operators are used [131]. Here, in addition to the techniques discussed above, one utilizes a construct known as the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert\n(SW), or clover, action [43] as well as anisotropic lattices. The latter have\ndifferent lattice constants as and at for space and time respectively, typically\nas > at . The purpose of combining those features is to push doublers, or\nghosts, into the high-mass region where they can do little harm to hadronic\nphysics. Actions of this class are well documented, technical issues are in\nthe foreground at this time [131, 132, 133, 134]. We refrain from discussing\nthese further.\n\n8.5\n\nAppendix B.5: Clover Leaf Fermion Action\n\nThe SW action deserves being mentioned here because of its widespread use\nand relatively simple implementation.\nThe idea is to consider (integration) variable transformations of the\nfermion fields in the path integral that defines the lattice QFT. This will\nof course not alter the physics of the theory but, in general, change the\nappearance of the lattice action written in terms of the transformed fields.\nThe additional terms are called redundant. Sheikholeslami and Wohlert [43]\nconsidered (among an extensive list of other possibilities) the transformation\n\u03c8 = [1 \u2212\n\nra\n(\u03b3\u03bc \u2206\u03bc \u2212 m\u2032 )]\u03c8 \u2032\n4\n\n\u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8\u0304 \u2032 [1 \u2212\n\nra\n(\u2206\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc \u2212 m\u2032 )]\n4\n\n(B.51)\n\nwhere \u03c8 \u2032 ,\u03c8\u0304 \u2032 refer to the original field variables and mass m\u2032 . Working out\nthe Dirac action we obtain\n\u03c8\u0304 \u2032 (\u03b3\u03bc \u2206\u03bc + m\u2032 )\u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8\u0304[\u03b3\u03bc \u2206\u03bc + m \u2212\n\nra\n1\n(\u2206\u03bc \u2206\u03bc + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd gF\u03bc\u03bd )]\u03c8 + o(a2 ) (B.52)\n2\n2\n\nwith\n\n1\nm = m\u2032 (1 + ram\u2032 ) .\n2\nThe \u03c3 * F term stems from the identity\n1\n(D\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc )2 = D\u03bc D\u03bc + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd gF\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\nwith\n\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n(B.53)\n\n1\n[\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ] .\n2i\n\nThis leads to the SW, or clover, action\n\u03ba 4 XX\n(SW )\n=\nSF\n\u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd P\u03bc\u03bd (x)\u03c8(x),\na\n2iu3\nx \u03bc,\u03bd\n80\n\n(B.54)\n\n(B.55)\n\n\fx+a \u03bd^\n\n^\nx-a \u03bc\n\nx\n\n^\nx+a\u03bc\n\nx-a \u03bd^\n\nFigure 32: Geometry of the paths used in P\u03bc\u03bd (x) for the clover action.\nwhich is an additive part to the standard Wilson fermion action.

This feature is computationally desirable since it leads to simpler and faster codes.\nThe clover action and the action discussed in Sec. 8.3 are related [135].\n\nReferences\n[1] H. Yukawa. Proc.
