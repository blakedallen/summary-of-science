The nature of either Dark Matter (DM) or Dark Energy\n(DE) remains a mystery, in spite of the improved determinations of their contribution to\nthe total energy density of the Universe.\nWhile the nature of Dark Matter seems less uncertain (most cosmologists are in favor\nof a particle physics origin), that of Dark Energy is still unexplored territory. In the last\ndecade there has been a plethora of proposals to account for the observed acceleration of the\nuniverse. All these proposals fall into four main categories: i) the inclusion of some extra\nfield (scalar, vector or tensor), coupled or not to the rest of matter, like in quintessence,\nchameleon, vector dark energy or massive gravity; ii) the extension of GR by inclusion of\nhigher order terms in the Einsten-Hilbert action, like f(R) theories, Gauss-Bonnet terms,\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fetc.; iii) the modification of gravity on large scales by introduction of extra dimensions, like\nin the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, Kaluza-Klein gravity, etc.; iv) the reinterpretation\nin terms of a nontrivial spatial geometry, like in large-void inhomogeneous LTB models.\nFor a recent review on DE modeling, see for example [1, 2].\nAll of these proposals have very specific predictions for the background evolution of\ncosmological space-times, and most of them can be well fitted to the present observations\nwith just a few phenomenological parameters: the equation of state, the speed of sound,\nthe coupling between DM and DE, bulk viscosity, etc. However, in order to discriminate\nbetween the different alternatives it has been realized that one has to go beyond the background evolution and start to consider also the theory of linear cosmological perturbations\nand parametrize their evolution in terms of the growth function and growth index, as well\nas the shift parameter.\nAt the moment, the main observables used to constrain the dark sector are the cepheids\nand supernovae magnitudes for the determination of the expansion rate as a function of\nredshift, see [3] for the most recent measurements; the power spectrum of matter and\nthe baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale for the determination of the matter content\nas a function of redshift, see [4, 5], together with the cosmic microwave background for\nthe determination of global spatial curvature and the asymptotic values of cosmological\nparameters [6], and the weak lensing shear power spectrum [7], or the ISW-galaxy crosscorrelation [8], for consistency of the whole scenario. Most of these measurements are\nrather preliminary and suggest a detection of DE at the 2 to 3 sigma level. However, a\nsignificant improvement is expected in the present decade thanks to Planck [9, 10], DES [11],\nBOSS [12] and, in the future, the Euclid survey [13].\nIn this paper, we study the prospects that a survey like Euclid would have in distinguishing between the four main classes of DE models. In the process, we find exact and\napproximate solutions for the growth index in terms of simple functions, for \u039bCDM models with a constant and variable equation of state parameter. We then propose a simple\nparametrization of the growth index that fits well the recent history, except for extreme\nmodels like f (R). We note that while the background parameters H(z), \u03a9M (z) and w(z)\nseem to be rather similar to those of \u039bCDM, the growth index can differ significantly for\nmost classes of models.\nThe parametrization of the density contrast with the growth index was first introduced\nby Peebles in 1980 [14]. We knew that the rate of growth of structures should be a function\nof the matter density. Several parametrization attempts including a power law expansion\nor simply the square root of the matter density parameter did not quite fit the data.\nFinally, the \u03b3 parametrization was the most widely accepted one; however, we will have\nto wait for a direct measurements of the growth index, which will only be possible with\nthe next generation of experiments. It is therefore tantalizing to explore the possibilities\nof distinguishing between different DE models with a better determination of the growth\nindex than what we have at present. That is the reason why we study a survey like Euclid,\nthat will allow us to obtain information not only about the matter distribution (power\nspectrum P (k) of perturbations) but also about the weak lensing (WL) spectrum.\nWe perform a Fisher matrix analysis of the sensitivity of a Euclid-like survey to the\ngrowth index using the marginalized and complete power spectrum P (k) and WL observables, and find that one can improve significantly its determination if we know the specific\nform of the redshift dependence of the growth index. We find that using P (k) alone, one\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fcan reach (2%, 5%) errors in (w0 , wa ), and (4%, 12%) errors in (\u03b30 , \u03b3a ), while using WL we\nget errors at least twice as large. These estimates allow us to differentiate easily between\nDGP, f (R) models and \u039bCDM, while it would be more difficult to distinguish the latter\nfrom a variable equation of state parameter or LTB models using only the growth index.\n\n2\n\nThe background equations\n\nHere we review the basic equations for the relevant background quantities. The evolution of\nthe dark energy can be expressed by the present dark energy density \u03a9DE and its equation\nof state parameter:\np\nw(a) = .\n(2.1)\n\u03c1\nGiven any w(a), the dark energy density is given by:\n\u03c1(a) = \u03c10 a\u22123(1+\u0175)\nwhere\n\n1\n\u0175(a) =\nln a\n\nZ\n\na\n\n1\n\nw (a0 ) 0\nda .\na0\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe Hubble parameter, H(a), is\ni\nh\nH 2 (a) = H02 \u03a9m,0 a\u22123 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m,0 ) a\u22123(1+\u0175) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the subscript 0 denotes the present epoch, and we are assuming global spatial flatness\n(K = 0).

(2.4) and (2.5) imply that we limit ourselves to a flat universe which is filled with\nmatter (denoted by the subscript m) and a general dark enery fluid.\nThe total matter and dark energy densities are:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 \u03a9m,0 \u22123\u0175 \u22121\n\u03a9m (a) = 1 +\na\n,\n\u03a9m,0\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u03a9m,0\n3\u0175\n\u03a9de (a) = 1 +\na\n= 1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a) .\n1 \u2212 \u03a9m,0\n\n3\n\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n\nThe perturbation equations\n\nIn this section, we consider linear perturbations about a spatially-flat background model,\ndefined by the line element:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = a2 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 (1 + 2\u03a8) d\u03c4 2 + (1 \u2212 2\u03a6) dxi dxi\n(3.1)\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fwhere \u03c4 is the conformal time. From Eq. (3.1) it is clear that we are working in the\nConformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge, which influences the evolution of the perturbations on big scales (especially those larger than the Hubble horizon). However, on\nsmaller scales the choice of the gauge is less important, and we expect the perturbations\nto evolve independently from the gauge choice.\nThe perturbation equations for a general fluid with an equation of state parameter\nw = p/\u03c1 are [15, 16]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nV\n1 \u03b4p\n\u03b4 0 = 3 (1 + w) \u03a60 \u2212\n\u2212\n3\n\u2212\nw\u03b4\n,\n(3.2)\nHa2\na \u03c1\nV\nk2\nk 2 \u03b4p\nk2\nV 0 = \u2212 (1 \u2212 3w) +\n\u03a8\n\u2212\n(1\n+\nw)\n\u03c3,\n(3.3)\n+\n(1\n+\nw)\na\nHa2 \u03c1\nHa2\nHa2\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 is the density contrast, V = ikj T0j /\u03c1 is the scalar velocity perturbation\n(see [17]) and the primes denote derivatives with respect to the scale factor a; also \u03b4p and\n\u03c3 are the pressure perturbation and the anisotropic stress, respectively, and they depend\non the characteristics of the fluid itself.\nIn this paper we are interested on the evolution of the matter density field, which\nimplies that w = \u03b4p = \u03c3 = 0, at small scales (but sufficiently large for linear perturbation\ntheory to still hold). Furthermore, we also assume that the dark energy fluid enters only\nat the background level. This assumption is usually violated as dark energy perturbations\nmay influence the evolution of the matter density field especially when the dark energy\nsound speed is small [18\u201320], since it is then able to cluster at small scales. However,\nunder the assumption of a high value of the dark energy sound speed (as is the case for the\nquintessence model, where c2s = 1) we expect this assumption still to hold because dark\nenergy is able to cluster only on very large scales.\nUnder these assumptions, Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3) read:\nVm\n,\nHa2\nVm\nk2\n=\u2212\n+\n\u03a6.\na\nHa2\n\n0\n\u03b4m\n=\u2212\n\n(3.4)\n\nVm0\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe above equations are linked together through the gravitational potential \u03a6\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3aH\n2\n2\nk \u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0Ga \u03c1m \u03b4m + 2 Vm\nk\n\n(3.6)\n\nand \u03a8 = \u03a6.\nJoining Eq. (3.4) and Eq. (3.5), the master equation for the matter denstiy contrast\nbecomes:\n\u0001 0\n3\n00\na2 \u03b4m\n(a) + 3 \u2212 \u000f(a) a \u03b4m\n(a) \u2212 \u03a9m (a)\u03b4m (a) = 0 ,\n(3.7)\n2\nwhere \u000f(a) = \u2212d log H(a)/d log a. The exact growing mode solution of the above differential\nequation, for a constant dark energy equation of state parameter, w, is [21, 22]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n5\nw \u2212 1 \u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b4m (a) = a * 2F1\n,\n,1 \u2212\n; 1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a) ,\n(3.8)\n2w 3w\n6w\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fwhere 2F1 are Hypergeometric functions, see Ref.[23], and the full solution, including decaying modes, is reported in the Appendix A. Equation (3.8) can be further simplified\nusing trasformation formulae for the Hypergeometric functions [23] into\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1 1\n1\n5\n\u2212 3w\n\u03b4m (a) = a \u03a9m (a)\n, \u2212\n,1 \u2212\n; 1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a) .\n(3.9)\n2F1 \u2212\n3w 2 3w\n6w\nIt is worth having a further look at the structure of the solution found. Eq. (3.9) is\ncomposed of two terms: the first one is the usual scale factor a, which is the solution we\nexpect if dark energy had been neglected also at background level; furthermore, Eq. (3.9)\nreduces to the classical solution in the matter domination era; this can be clearly seen if we\nset \u03a9m (a) \u2192 1, then the Hypergeometric function is 1. The second term instead, contains\nall the information about the dark energy fluid: via a direct dependence on \u03a9m (a) and the\nHypergeometric function, whose dependence is not straightforward. It is worth noticing\n1\nthat the slowed contribution to the dark matter comes from the term \u03a9m (a)\u2212 3w but its\ncontribution is too big and it suppresses too much the growth of matter perturbations,\nthe Hypergeometric function in Eq. (3.9), instead, is a function that slowly increases with\nthe scale factor, from 1 for a \u001c 1 to just 1.16 for a \u223c 1. This compensates for the extra\n1\nsuppression of the \u03a9m (a)\u2212 3w term.\nIn order to evaluate the growth rate, we start using Eq. (3.9), and write it as, see\nAppendix A,\nh\ni\n5/6w\n\u22121/2\nP\n\u03a9\n(a)\nm\n1/6w\nd log \u03b4m\n1/2\nh\ni.\n= \u03a9m\n(a)\nf (a) =\n(3.10)\n5/6w\n\u22121/2\nd log a\nP\u22121/6w \u03a9m (a)\nThis function is simpler to evaluate for a given model, and has the explicit dependence\nof the growth factor as a function of \u03a9m (a). We will use it in the next subsection on the\ngamma parametrization.\n3.1\n\nVarying equation of state parameter\n\nWe can extend our discussion also to a varying dark energy equation of state parameter\nw(a). In this case there are no exact analytical solutions for the matter density contrast\nas for the case of a constant w; the main problem is that there is no direct transformation\nbetween the scale factor a and the new variable u, see Appendix A. Here we assume the\nequation of state parameter to be:\nw(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a) ,\nfor which the matter density parameter can be integrated\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a9de,0 \u22123(w0 +wa ) 3wa (a\u22121) \u22121\na\ne\n.\n\u03a9m (a) = 1 +\n\u03a9m,0\n\n(3.11)\n\n(3.12)\n\nWe can also integrate the master equation in this case, and although we have found no\nexact analytical solution, we found an approximate solution which is within 0.1% of the\nnumerical solution for the whole range of (w0 , wa ) values. In this case the growth rate\nreads\nh\ni\n5/6w(a)+w a/6w2 (a)\n\u22121/2\nP1/6w(a) a\n\u03a9m (a)\nh\ni.\n(3.13)\nf (a) = \u03a91/2\nm (a)\n5/6w(a)+w a/6w2 (a)\n\u22121/2\nP\u22121/6w(a) a\n\u03a9m (a)\nThis is a very compact expression which will be very useful in the next subsection.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f3.2\n\nThe gamma parametrization\n\nA potentially more promising place to look for the impact of dark energy is the way in\nwhich the matter perturbations grow over time. Often the impact of the dark energy on\nthe growth rate of the matter perturbations is parametrized in terms of the growth index\n\u03b3, defined through [14]:\nf (a) = \u03a9m (a)\u03b3 .\n(3.14)\nSuch a parametrization assumed \u03b3 to be constant and, moreover, with a value that was\nvery approximately \u03b3 ' 0.6 for general relativity plus a cosmological constant \u039b, i.e. for a\nconstant equation of state parameter w = p/\u03c1 = \u22121. Furthermore, detailed studies went\nfurther and computed the \u03b3 parameter for a constant but arbitrary w, [24]:\n\u03b3=\n\n3(w \u2212 1)\n,\n(6w \u2212 5)\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhich reduces to \u03b3 = 6/11 ' 0.55 for w = \u22121. The last equation does not take into\naccount the dependence of \u03b3 on the matter density parameter. There is an expression for\nthe growth index \u03b3 which does depend on \u03a9m (a) < 1, to first order, see Ref. [25],\n\u03b3=\n\n\u0001\n\u00012\n3(w \u2212 1) 3 (1 \u2212 w) (2 \u2212 3w)\n+\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a9\n(a)\n+\nO\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a9\n,\nm\nm\n(6w \u2212 5) 2\n(5 \u2212 6w)3\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhich reduces to the well known result (3.15) in the limit a \u2192 0. However, we have found\nin Eq. (3.10) an exact solution for all a. Using Eq. (3.14) we have\n\uf8ee 5/6w h \u22121/2 i \uf8f9\nP1/6w \u03a9m (a)\n1\n1\nh\ni\uf8fb .\nln \uf8f0\n(3.17)\n\u03b3(a) = +\n5/6w\n\u22121/2\n2 ln \u03a9m (a)\nP\n\u03a9m (a)\n\u22121/6w\n\nIn particular, Eq. (3.17) depends not only on w, but also on \u03a9m,0 . For the fiducial values\nw = \u22121 and \u03a9m,0 = 0.25, one finds \u03b3(a = 1) = 0.556 instead of \u03b3(a \u2192 0) = 0.545. For\npresent day purposes, with galaxy surveys providing at most a few percent accuracy on\nthe growth parameter, this difference \u2212 of order 3% \u2212 may seem academic. However, for\nfuture surveys like PAU [26], LSST [27] or Euclid [13], where we will have tomographic\nreconstruction of the past history in both the matter distribution and the expansion rate, up\nto redshift z ' 2, these differences may begin to play an important role as a discriminator\nbetween standard GR with a cosmological constant and e.g. modified gravity theories like\nf (R), or quintessence models.\nThe same discussions apply when we want to evaluate the growth index when the\nequation of state parameter is a function of the scale factor,\n\uf8ee 5/6w(a)+w a/6w2 (a) h \u22121/2 i \uf8f9\nP1/6w(a) a\n\u03a9m (a)\n1\n1\n\uf8f0\nh\ni\uf8fb .\n\u03b3(a) = +\nln\n(3.18)\n5/6w(a)+wa a/6w2 (a)\n\u22121/2\n2 ln \u03a9m (a)\nP\n\u03a9m (a)\n\u22121/6w(a)\n\nIn the next section we will discuss the growth index for different Dark Energy models.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f4\n\nThe growth index for different Dark Energy models\n\nHere we discuss a range of models of dark energy which have very different behaviours\nfor the growth index \u03b3 as a function of redshift. The models we consider here are f (R)\ntheories, the DGP model, LTB cosmologies and wCDM . With this choice of models we\nwish to cover the different possibilities to explain dark energy: modified gravity theories\n(f (R) and DGP models), modified geometry (LTB models) and modified matter through\nwCDM, which can be associated with, for example, a quintessence model through the\ncorrespondence between f (\u03c6) and w(a).\n4.1\n\nThe Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model\n\nThe brane-world scenario offers an alternative to explain the current acceleration of the\nuniverse. In the DGP model [28], gravity lives in a 4 dimensional brane with the rest\nof matter fields for scales \u03bb < rc while it seeps into a fifth dimensional bulk for \u03bb > rc ,\nweakening its strength in our brane. For such models, the Hubble parameter is given by\n[29]\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\np\n\u22123\nH(a) = H0\n(4.1)\n\u03a9rc + \u03a9rc + \u03a9m,0 a\nwhere \u03a9rc = 1/(4rc2 H02 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03a9m,0 )2 /4. The Poisson equation is modified in these models\nas follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03ba2\n1\n2\nk \u03a6=\u2212\n1\u2212\n\u03c1m \u03b4m\n(4.2)\n2\n3\u03b2\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 \u2212\n[30, 31]:\n\n2(Hrc )2\n2Hrc \u22121 .\n\nFor the growth index, we have used the approximation found by\n\u03b3(a) =\n\n7 + 5\u03a9M (a) + 7\u03a92M (a) + 3\u03a93M (a)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n,\n1 + \u03a92M (a) [11 + 5\u03a9M (a)]\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere \u03a9M is given by\nh\n\u03a9m (a) = 1 \u2212\n\n1\n=h\nHrc\n\n1+\n1+\n\n4\u03a9m,0\na3 (1\u2212\u03a9m,0 )2\n\ni1/2\n\n4\u03a9m,0\na3 (1\u2212\u03a9m,0 )2\n\ni1/2\n\n\u22121\n,\n\n(4.4)\n\n+1\n\nwhile the effective equation of state reads\nw(a) =\n4.2\n\nHrc\n\u22121\n=\n.\n1 \u2212 2Hrc\n1 + \u03a9m (a)\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe Starobinsky f (R) model\n\nThe simplest way to modify general relativity is by substituting the Ricci scalar R with a\nfunction f (R), in the Einstein-Hilbert action, [32]:\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(4.6)\nS = 2 d4 x \u2212gf (R) + Sm (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8m )\n2\u03ba\nThe equivalent of the Friedmann equations for a perfect nonrelativistic matter fluid for this\naction are given by\nF R \u2212 f (R)\n3F H 2 = \u03c1m +\n\u2212 3H \u1e1e ,\n2\n(4.7)\n\u22122F \u1e22 = \u03c1m + F\u0308 \u2212 H \u1e1e ,\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere F \u2261 f 0 (R). The Ricci scalar R is expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter as\nR = 12H 2 + 6\u1e22 for a flat background. It is convenient to introduce a set of dimensionless\nvariables to study the dynamics of f (R) gravity [33]:\n\u1e1e\nR\nf (R)\n,\nx3 =\n,\nx4 = aH.\n(4.8)\n,\nx2 = \u2212\n2\nHF\n6F H\n6H 2\nThe matter density parameter is then given by\n\u03c1m\n\u03a9\u0303m \u2261\n= 1 \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 x3\n(4.9)\n3F H 2\nWith these variables we obtain the following closed system of differential equations\nx1 = \u2212\n\nx01 = \u22121 \u2212 x3 \u2212 3x2 + x21 \u2212 x1 x3 ,\nx1 x3\n\u2212 x2 (2x3 \u2212 4 \u2212 x1 ) ,\nm(r)\nx1 x3\n\u2212 2x3 (x3 \u2212 2) ,\nx03 = \u2212\nm(r)\nx04 = (x3 \u2212 1)x4 .\nx02 =\n\nwhere a prime represents a derivative with respect to N = ln a and\nRf,R\nRf,RR\nx3\n,\nr\u2261\u2212\n=\n.\nm(r) \u2261\nf,R\nf\nx2\n\n(4.10)\n\n(4.11)\n\nThe linear perturbation equation for the matter density contrast in the comoving gauge\n(where the matter velocity vanishes), in terms of the dimensionless variables, x1 , x2 and\nx3 , is [34]\n\u0014 \u0010\n\u0011 k2 \u0015\nx3\n00\n0\n\u2212 1 \u2212 2 \u03b4 F\u0303 \u2212 3\u03b4 F\u0303 0 ,\n\u03b4m + (x1 + x3 )\u03b4m \u2212 3(1 \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 x3 )\u03b4m = 3 x1 + x3 \u2212\nm\nx4\n(4.12)\nwhere the differential equation for \u03b4 F\u0303 = \u03b4F/F is\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nk\n2x3\n+ 3x2 \u2212 x1 + 1 \u03b4 F\u0303 = 0 .\n(4.13)\n\u03b4 F\u0303 00 + (2x1 \u2212 x3 \u2212 1)\u03b4 F\u0303 0 + 2 \u2212 x3 +\nm\nx4\nSolving the coupled differential equations (4.10), we can obtain the background functions\nH(a) =\n\nx4 (a)\n,\na\n\n\u0001\n\u03a9m (a) = F (a) 1 \u2212 x1 (a) \u2212 x2 (a) \u2212 x3 (a) ,\nw(a) =\n\n(4.14)\n\n1 \u2212 2 x3 (a)\n.\n3(1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a))\n\nThen solving equations (4.12) and (4.13) numerically for a given scale k, we find a solution\nfor \u03b4m , and compute from it the growth index \u03b3.\nIn this paper we study the Starobinsky model [35] where f (R) is given by\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u0013\u2212n\nR2\nf (R) = R + \u03bbR0\n1+ 2\n\u22121\n(4.15)\nR0\nwhere \u03bb and n are two positive constants and R0 corresponds to the present value of the\nRicci scalar. To be in agreement with observations, we take n = 2 and \u03bb = 2 [36]. We also\ntake k = 0.16 h/Mpc in Eq. (4.12) to calculate the density contrast and the growth index.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f4.3\n\nThe Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Tolman-Bondi large-void model\n\nA plausible alternative to explain the current acceleration of the universe are inhomogeneous universe models in which the acceleration we seem to perceive is caused by our\nposition as observers inside an underdense region of space. One of the simplest models\nto study the effect of such large inhomogeneities is the spherically symmetric Lema\u0131\u0302treTolman-Bondi model [37\u201339]. In this model, the metric is given by\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + X 2 (r, t) dr2 + A2 (r, t) d\u03a92 ,\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 and the equivalent of the scale factor now depends on the\nradial coordinate as well as time. We can find a relationship between X(r, t) and\np A(r, t)\n0\nusing the the 0 \u2212 r component of the Einstein equations: X(r, t) = A (r, t)/ 1 \u2212 k(r)\nwhere a prime denotes a derivative with respect to coordinate r and k(r) is an arbitrary\nfunction that plays the role of the spatial curvature parameter.\nTo find the growth index in LTB cosmologies we must study linear perturbation theory\nin inhomogeneous universes. Due to the loss of a degree of symmetry, the decomposition\ntheorem does no longer hold. This means that, in general, our perturbations will no longer\ndecouple into scalar, vector and tensor modes. A study of the perturbation equations in\nthis scenario using a 1+1+2 decomposition of spacetime can be found in [40]. However, if\nthe normalized shear \u03b5 = (HT \u2212 HL )/(2HT + HL ) is small, as observations seem to confirm\n[41], we can use the ADM formalism and express our perturbed LTB metric as\nds2 = \u2212(1 + 2\u03a6)dt2 + (1 \u2212 2\u03a8)\u03b3ij dxi dxj\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere \u03b3ij = diag{X 2 (r, t), A2 (r, t), A2 (r, t) sin2 \u03b8}. Within this formalism, the evolution\nequation for a pressure-less fluid in the conformal Newtonian gauge (where the absence of\nanisotropic stresses gives \u03a6 = \u03a8) is given by\n\u03a6\u0308 + 4HT \u03a6\u0307 + (4\u1e22T + 6HT2 )\u03a6 = 0\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere we now have two different expansion rates HT (r, t) = \u0226/A and HL (r, t) = \u02260 /A0\nwhich correspond respectively to the transverse and longitudinal expansion rates. The\ngrowing mode solution of equation (4.18) is given by\nh\n7 i\n\u03a6(r, t) = \u03a60 (r) 2F1 1, 2, ; u ,\n(4.19)\n2\nwhere u = k(r)A(r, t)/F (r) and F (r) = H02 (r)\u03a9M (r)A3 (r, t0 ) specifies the local matter\ndensity today. With this solution we find the density contrast,\nA(r, t)\n\u03a6(r, t)\n(4.20)\nr\nWe can now calculate the growth index as before, noting that now the matter density\nparameter is a function of redshift via both time t and the radial coordinate r. In LTB\nmodels, this is in principle an arbitrary function which must be fixed in each case. In the\ncase of the constrained GBH model [42, 43] the parameters are given by\n\u03b4(r, t) =\n\n1 \u2212 tanh[(r \u2212 r0 )/2\u2206r]\n(0)\n\u03a9M (r) = 1 + (\u03a9M \u2212 1)\n1 + tanh[r0 /\u2206r]\ns\n\"\n#\n1\n\u03a9M (r)\n1 \u2212 \u03a9M (r)\nH0 (r) = H0\n\u2212\narcsinh\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03a9M (r) (1 \u2212 \u03a9M (r))3/2\n\u03a9M (r)\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(4.21)\n(4.22)\n\n\fwith\nr0 = 3.0 Gpc ,\n\n\u2206r = 1.5 r0 ,\n\nh0 = 0.74 ,\n\n(0)\n\n\u03a9M = 0.15 ,\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhere these values have been chosen to best fit the supernovae data [41, 44]. Within this\nmodel, the growth rate, i.e. the logarithmic derivative of the density contrast, is given by\nh\ni\n9\n\u22121 (z)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nF\n2,\n3,\n;\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a9\n2 1\nm\n2\n4\nh\ni,\nf (z) = 1 +\n1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\n(4.24)\nm (z)\n7\nF 1, 2, 7 ; 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u22121\n(z)\nm\n2 1\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03a9m (z) is the fraction of matter density to critical density, as a function of redshift.1\nThis function (4.24) is identical to the instantaneous growth function of matter density in\nan open universe, where the local matter density \u03a9M is given by \u03a9m (z) at that redshift.\nThis is a good approximation only in LTB models with small cosmic shear, see Ref. [45].\nAlternatively, we can write the growth function in terms of Legendre polynomials,\nh\ni\n\u22125/2\n\u22121/2\nP\u22121/2 \u03a9m (z)\n1/2\nh\ni,\nf (z) = \u03a9m\n(z)\n(4.25)\n\u22125/2\n\u22121/2\nP1/2 \u03a9m (z)\nwhich can also be written in terms of ordinary functions,\np\n\u221a\n9u(1 \u2212 u2 ) + 6(1 + 2u2 ) u2 \u2212 1 arcsinh (u \u2212 1)/2\np\n\u221a\n,\nf (z) =\n2u(u4 + u2 \u2212 1) \u2212 12u2 u2 \u2212 1 arcsinh (u \u2212 1)/2\n\n(4.26)\n\n\u22121/2\n\nwhere u \u2261 \u03a9m (z) > 1.\nThe equation of state w(z) has been obtained for this model from the expression\nw(a) =\n\n\u22121\na \u03a90m (a)/\u03a9m (a)\nd log(\u03a9\u22121\nm (a) \u2212 1)\n=\nd log a3\n3(1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a))\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhich was used in Fig. 1. Note that the rate of expansion H(z) for this model is similar\nto that of \u039bCDM, which explains why it fits the SNIa data [46, 47].\n4.4\n\nComparison of the growth index for the different models\n\nNow we are ready to compare the results of the different models studied here. In Fig. 1\nwe can see the Hubble rate, the matter density parameter, the equation of state and the\ngrowth index for all the models studied. In the case of wCDM we have taken w0 = \u22120.9\nand wa = 0.2. As it is seen, even though the expansion history, matter density parameter\nand equation of state are quite different for the different models considered, most of them\nhave a similar growth index, being the biggest difference between DGP, f (R) and the rest.\nThis difference in growth indices comes from how linear perturbations in the matter\ndensity are described in each of the models. In the case of f (R), if we neglect the oscillation\nmode of \u03b4F relative to the mode induced by matter perturbations \u03b4m , we can obtain the\nfollowing approximate equation for matter perturbations:\n\u03b4\u0308m + 2H \u03b4\u0307m \u2212 4\u03c0Geff \u03c1m \u03b4m ' 0\n\n(4.28)\n\nThe matter density in LTB model is given by \u03c1(r, t) = F 0 (r)/A0 (r, t)A2 (r, t). Note that this is different\nfrom \u03a9M (r) = F (r)/A3 (r, t0 )H02 (r), which gives the mass radial function today, see Ref.

The quantity Geff encodes the modification of gravity due to the presence of the\nscalaron field. Thus, the Poisson equation in Fourier space is transformed by replacing\nNewton's gravitational by the effective one in Eq. (4.29). The transition from the GR\nregime to the scalar-tensor one occurs when m \u223c (aH/k)2 . For the wave numbers relevant\nto the observable linear region of the matter power spectrum we require m(z = 0) & 3\u00d710\u22126\nfor the transition to have occurred by today. The Starobinsky model in particular allows\nfor a rapid growth of m from R \u001d H02 (m . 10\u221215 ) to R ' H02 (m = O(0.1)).\nAnother way to understand the evolution of \u03b3 in the Starobinsky model is analysing\nthe evolution equation [48]. At high redshifts, we can approximate this evolution equation\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fto [49]\nd\u03b3\n(1 + z)(1 \u2212 \u03a9m )\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013dz\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n3 Geff\n6\n3\n11\nGeff\n3\n=\n\u03b3\u2212\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\u2212 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m )\n\u2212 1 \u2212 (2\u03b3 \u2212 1)(wDE + 1)\n2\nG\n2\n11\n2\nG\n2\n(4.30)\nAt early stages, the first term of the right hand side of Eq. (4.30) dominates. This is why\n\u03b3 decreases as Geff /G increases, even becoming negative. As we approach the present era,\nthe second term starts to dominate making \u03b3 increase again.\nIn the case of the DGP model, the effect of the extra dimension affects both the friction\nterm in the evolution equation for \u03b4m and the source term as, similarly to f (R) gravity, we\ncan define an effective gravitational constant as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nGeff = G 1 \u2212\n(4.31)\n3\u03b2\nwhere here \u03b2 is the same as the parameter described in Eq. (4.2). As we can see in Fig. (1b),\nthe parameter \u03a9M is smaller for the DGP model than for the standard \u039bCDM one. To\ncompensate for this lack of matter density, the growth index is higher than for the rest of\nthe models, as it is clear from Fig. (1d).\nIn the case of the LTB model, we see in Fig. (1c) that the equation of state parameter w\ndiffers significantly from all the other models. The reason for this can be seen by looking at\nthe formula used to calculate w(a), Eq. (4.27). The expansion rate is similar to the \u039bCDM\ncase since the parameters chosen for the void model considered have been chosen to fit\nthe supernovae data. As we can see, the growth index for this model is not significantly\ndifferent from the flat universe scenario and also tends to an asymptotic value given by\n\u03b3 = 0.573, very close to the predicted one in the \u039bCDM case.\nAs regards the wCDM model studied, we have used the values of w0 = \u22120.9 and\nwa = 0.2 to calculate the growth index using Eq. (3.13). We have chosen these values to\nsee how a considerably different model from the standard \u039bCDM one can have a growth\nindex that is barely distinguishable from it, as it can be seen in Fig. (1d).\n4.4.1\n\nAnsatz for the growth index\n\nIn this subsection we compare the different models' growth indices' redshift evolution with\nthe Ansatz [71, 73]\n\u03b3(a) = \u03b30 + \u03b3a (1 \u2212 a) .\n(4.32)\nWe have plotted in Fig. 2 the known redshift dependence of the growth index for the\ndifferent models together with the corresponding values derived with the above Ansatz. As\ncan be seen very clearly, for most models this is an excellent approximation. However, for\nf (R) models it fails to work at relatively nearby redshifts. For this reason we have adapted\nour Fisher matrix analysis for this specific case, see Section 6.\n\n5\n\nFisher matrix analysis prospects for a survey like Euclid\n\nThe Fisher information matrix can be used to quantify the amount of information that an\nobservable random variable X carries about a set of unknown parameters \u03b8.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f0.8\n\nDGP\nLTB\n\n\u0393HzL\n\n0.6\n\nwCDM\n\nLCDM\n0.4\n\nfS HRL\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nz\n\nFigure 2: The redshift evolution of the growth index compared to the linear approximation\nin Eq. (4.32) (continuous lines), for all four classes of models. Note that while for most\nmodels the Ansatz gives an excellent description, for f (R) models it deviates significantly\neven for moderate redshifts.\nMore specifically, let us assume that we have a data set arranged as a n-dimensional\nvector X = {x1 , x2 , ...xn } which can be thought of as a random variable with its probability\ndistribution function L (X; \u03b8) which depends on the model parameters \u03b8 in a known way.\nThe Fisher matrix is defined as the second derivatives of the logarithm of the probability\ndistribution function with respect the parameters:\n\u001c 2 \u001d\n\u2202 L\nFij =\n(5.1)\n\u2202\u03b8i \u2202\u03b8j\nwhere L = \u2212 ln L. For a sufficiently large sample (in cosmology, a large survey), the central\nlimit theorem ensures that the probability distribution function of the random variable X\nbecomes Gaussian centered about their true value. In this case, in Eq. (5.1), the logarithm\nof the likelihood function L (X; \u03b8) becomes a quadratic function of the variable X about\nits maximum. So, only under the assumption of a large sample, the inverse of the Fisher\nmatrix becomes the covariance matrix and it can be used to estimate the errors on the\nparameters and furthermore to look at degeneracies between them. Then, with the help of\nthe Cramer-Rao inequality, one can estimate the minimum variance of the parameter from\nthe data set: the root square of the diagonal elements \u0001of the inverse of the Fisher matrix\ngive the best errors on the parameters, ie. \u2206\u03b8i = F \u22121 ii .\nThis method is extremely useful, for instance, when we want to optimize the design of\na survey, in the sense that it is possible to model such a survey in order to maximize its\ninformation content on the particular parameters we want to measure.\n5.1\n\nComplete galaxy power spectrum\n\nThere are two ways we can get information about dark energy parameters by looking\nat the galaxy power spectrum: first, by marginalizing over the main observables: the\nHubble parameter, the angular diameter distance, the growth factor and the redshift space\ndistortion parameter and projecting on to the dark energy parameter space; secondly, by\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\ftaking the full information of the observed galaxy power spectrum and deduce from the\nlatter the parameters of interest.\nFollowing [50\u201352] we write the observed galaxy power spectrum as:\nPobs (z; k, \u03bc) =\n\n2 (z)H(z)\n\u00012\nDAr\nG2 (z)b(z)2 1 + \u03b2\u03bc2 P0r (k) + Pshot (z)\n2\nDA (z)Hr (z)\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere the subscript r refers to the values assumed for the reference cosmological model, i.e.\nthe model at which we evaluate the Fisher matrix, b(z) is the matter bias factor, G(z) is the\ngrowth factor of matter perturbations. Also here Pshot is the shot noise due to discreteness\nin the survey, \u03bc is the direction cosine within the survey, P0r is the present matter power\nspectrum for the fiducial (reference) cosmology. For the linear matter power spectrum we\nadopt the CAMB output [53].\nThe wavenumber k is also to be transformed between the fiducial cosmology and the\ngeneral one (see [50\u201352] for more details).\nThe distortion induced by redshift can be expressed in terms of the \u03b2(z) factor which\nis related to the bias factor via:\nf (z)\n\u03a9m (z)\u03b3\n\u03b2(z) =\n=\n.\n(5.3)\nb\nb\n\u00012\nThe 1 + \u03bc2 \u03b2 factor accounts only for linear distortion in the redshift space and it should\nbe considered as a first approximation. More work beyond Kaiser's small-angle and the\nGaussian approximation is needed, as discussed in [54\u201357].\nThe galaxy over-densities are assumed to trace the underlying matter distribution\nthrough a fraction called bias factor, b(z, k). This quantity could be arbitrary, it could\neven depend on both time and scale, see [58\u201360]. Usually it is assumed that the bias on\nlarge scales is independent on scale [61], hence in the matter power spectrum, this term\nappears as a multiplicative factor which modulates the overall amplitude of the galaxy\npower spectrum.\nWe will assume here a Gaussian linear bias, with redshift dependence\n\u221a\nb(z) = 1 + z, because it provides a good fit to the H\u03b1 line galaxies in the near-infrared,\nwhich are the target of a Euclid-like survey, see [62].\nG\nThe factor G(z) is related to the growth rate by f (a) = dd log\nlog a \u2212 1 and it is usually\nassumed to be independent on scale: the late-time change in the expansion rate affects all\nscales equally. However, the growth factor may depend on the scale k, for instance allowing\nperturbations also in the dark energy sector. In the last case, the existence of the dark\nenergy sound horizon will introduce a k dependence on the growth factor, see for instance\n[19, 20, 63]. However, here we assume a scale independent G(z) as we have neglected the\ndark energy perturbations.\nThe total galaxy power spectrum including the errors on the redshift can be written\nas [52]\n2 2 2\nP (z, k) = Pobs (z, k)ek \u03bc \u03c3r\n(5.4)\nwhere \u03c3r = \u03b4z/H(z) is the absolute error on the measurement of the distance and \u03b4z is\nthe absolute error on redshift.\nThe Fisher matrix provides a useful method for evaluating the marginalised errors\non cosmological parameters.

The highest frequency,\nkmax (z), is evaluated at z of the corresponding bin and it is chosen so as to avoid nonlinearity problems both in the spectrum and in the bias; we choose values from 0.11 h/Mpc\nfor small z bins to 0.25 h/Mpc for the highest redshift bins.\nAny submatrix of Fij\u22121 gives the correlation matrix for the parameters corresponding to\nrows and columns on that submatrix. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this correlation\nmatrix give the orientation and the size of the semiaxes of the ellipsoid confidence region.\nThis automatically marginalizes over the remaining parameters. The square root of the\ndiagonal elements will give the errors of the corresponding parameter.\n5.2\n\nMarginalized galaxy power spectrum\n\nThis approach consists on evaluating the Fisher matrix Fij first for the main observables\nshown in Tab. 1 and then project into the dark energy parameters, w0 , wa and \u03b3. Since\nwe want to propagate the errors to the cosmological parameters above, we need to change\nparameter space. This will be done taking the inverse of the Fisher matrix Fij\u22121 and\n\u22121 containing only the rows and columns with the\nthen extracting a submatrix, called Fmn\nparameters that depend on w0 , wa and \u03b3, namely H(z), DA (z), G(z) and \u03b2(z). Then\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fwe contract the inverse of the submatrix with the new set of parameters; the new Fisher\nmatrix will be given by\n\u2202pn\n\u2202pm\nSij =\nFmn\n.\n(5.7)\n\u2202qi\n\u2202qi\nThe square root of the diagonal elements of the matrix Sij gives the errors on the parameters\nw0 , wa and \u03b3(z). The growth index parameter will be discussed in more detail in the next\nsection.\n5.3\n\nWeak lensing\n\nFollowing [66, 67], the lensing potential is \u03a6L = \u03a8+\u03a6, which describes the deviation of light\nrays. As previously mentioned, we limit ourselves to scalar perturbations at linear order\nin the Newtonian gauge Eq. (3.1); as we are considering dark energy only at background\nlevel, the gravitational potential is simply given by Eq. (3.6). As \u03a6 = \u03a8 it follows that the\nweak lensing potential is:\n3H 2 \u03a9m,0\nk 2 \u03a6L = 2 0\n\u2206m .\n(5.8)\n2a\nThe convergence weak lensing power spectrum (which in the linear regime is equal to the\nellipticity power spectrum) is a linear function of the matter power spectrum convoluted\nwith the lensing properties of space. For a \u039bCDM cosmology it can be written as [68]\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ \u221e\ndz\nH0 `\n4\nPij (`) = H0\nWi (z)Wj (z)Pnl Pl\n,z\n(5.9)\nH(z)\nr(z)\n0\nwhere the Wi 's are the window functions, Pnl [Pl (k, z)] is the non linear power spectrum at\nredshift z obtained correcting the linear matter power spectrum Pl (k, z), see [18] for more\ndetails.\nThe Fisher matrix for weak lensing is given by:\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = fsky\n\nX (2` + 1) \u2206`\n`\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2202 (Pkm ),\u03b2 Cmi\n\u2202 (Pij ),\u03b1 Cjk\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere the partial derivatives represent \u2202/\u2202\u03b8\u03b1 , the corresponding cosmological parameters\n\u03b8\u03b1 are shown in Tab. 1 and\n1/2\nh\u03b3 i\nCjk = Pjk + \u03b4jk int\n(5.11)\nnj\n1/2\n\nwhere \u03b3int is the rms intrinsic shear (here we assume h\u03b3int i=0.22 [69]) and nj is the number\nof galaxies per steradians belonging to the i-th bin.\n\n6\n\nResults\n\nWe are now in the position to derive the sensitivity of a typical next-generation survey to\nthe dark energy parameters.\nIn particular, we consider a survey patterned according to the specification of the Euclid survey, see [13]. In order to do this we make use of the Fisher matrix formalism for the\nthree different observables introduced in the previous section: complete and marginalized\ngalaxy power spectrum and Weak Lensing.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fz\n\nn1 (z) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\nn2 (z) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n0.5 \u2212 0.7\n0.7 \u2212 0.9\n0.9 \u2212 1.1\n1.1 \u2212 1.3\n1.3 \u2212 1.5\n1.5 \u2212 1.7\n1.7 \u2212 1.9\n1.9 \u2212 2.1\n\n4.69\n3.33\n2.57\n2.1\n1.52\n0.92\n0.54\n0.31\n\n3.56\n2.42\n1.81\n1.44\n0.99\n0.55\n0.29\n0.15\n\nTable 2: Expected galaxy number density in each redshift bin for the Euclid survey in\nunits of (h/Mpc)3 .\nGalaxy redshift survey specifications: for the galaxy power spectrum cases we\nconsider a spectroscopic survey from z = 0.5 \u2212 2.1 divided in equally spaced bins of width\n\u2206z = 0.2 and with a covering area of 20000 deg2 ; the galaxy number densities in each bin\nare shown in Tab. 2 with an efficiency of 50%. For all cases we assume that the error on\nthe measured redshift is spectroscopic, \u03b4z = 0.001 (1 + z).\nWhile modeling the redshift survey, we choose two different cases according to the\ngalaxy number density [70, 71]:\n\u2022 optimistic case; this corresponds to the middle column in Tab. 2.\n\u2022 realistic case; this corresponds to the last column in Tab. 2.\nWeak lensing survey specifications: for the WL survey we consider a photometric\n2\nsurvey characterized by the sky fraction fskyh = 1/2, that\ni is, a covering area of 20000deg ;\nan overall radial distribution n(z) = z 2 exp \u2212 (z/z0 )1.5 with z0 = zmean /1.412 and mean\nredshift zmean = 0.9, the number density is d = 35 galaxies per arcmin2 . Moreover, we\nconsider the range 10 < ` < 10000 and we extend our survey up to zmax = 3 divided in\n5 bins each containing the same number of galaxies. For the non linear correction we use\nthe halo fit model by Smith et al. [72]. We assume the error on the measured redshift is\nphotometric, \u03b4z = 0.05 (1 + z).\nFiducial model: our fiducial model corresponds to the \u039bCDM WMAP-7yr [6]:\n\u03a9m,0 h2 = 0.134, \u03a9b h2 = 0.022, ns = 0.96, \u03c4 = 0.085, h = 0.7, \u03a9m,0 = 0.275 and \u03a9K = 0.\nFor the dark energy parameters we choose w0 = \u22121 and wa = 0.\nWe can now derive the sensitivity of the parameters introduced above. More specifically, we consider separately three different cases: in Case 1 the growth index has been\nchosen to be a free parameter but independent in each redshift bin; in Case 2 we consider\nthe growth index as a free parameter but equal for all the redshift bins; in Case 3 the\ngrowth index depends directly on the equation of state parameters (w0 and wa ), using\nEq.

However, the difference between the full\nanalytic expression for the growth index and its asymptotic value \u03b3 = 0.545 is too\nsmall to be detected even for a half sky survey like Euclid for both the spectroscopic\nand the photometric cases.\n\u2022 Case 2:\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fz\n\u03c3\u03b3real\n\u03c3\u03b3opt\n\nz\n\u03c3\u03b3real\n\u03c3\u03b3opt\n\n0.6\n0.0305\n0.0296\n\n0.8\n0.0231\n0.0219\n\n1.0\n0.0194\n0.0183\n\nP (k)\n1.2\n0.0159\n0.0147\n\n1.4\n0.0153\n0.0139\n\n1.6\n0.0162\n0.0141\n\n1.8\n0.0197\n0.0153\n\n2.0\n0.0281\n0.0185\n\n0.6\n0.0311\n0.0286\n\n0.8\n0.0286\n0.0256\n\n1.0\n0.0284\n0.0250\n\nmP(k)\n1.2\n0.0308\n0.0268\n\n1.4\n0.0337\n0.0292\n\n1.6\n0.0367\n0.0318\n\n1.8\n0.0397\n0.0342\n\n2.0\n0.0427\n0.0366\n\nTable 3: Here are listed the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 errors for the growth index \u03b3 at different redshifts for\nthe P (k) methods.\n\nz\n\u03c3\u03b3\n\nWL\n0.5\n1.0\n0.097 0.055\n\n2.0\n0.051\n\n3.0\n0.051\n\nTable 4: Here are listed the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 errors for the growth index \u03b3 at different redshifts for\nthe WL method.\nFor this case we chose the growth index to be [71, 73]\n\u03b3(z) = \u03b30 + \u03b3a (1 \u2212 a) = \u03b30 + \u03b3a\n\nz\n1+z\n\n(6.1)\n\nin order to compare the alternative theories introduced in the previous sections. Our\nreference cosmology is always \u039bCDM with \u03b30 = 0.55620 and \u03b3a = 0.0182537. We\nchoose these values according to the Taylor's expansion of Eq. (3.18) for the \u039bCDM\ncosmology. In Fig. 5 the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 confidence regions for the parameters w0 \u2212 wa (left\npanel) and \u03b30 \u2212 \u03b3a (right panel) for the galaxy power spectrum cases are shown.\nFor the WL case we found \u03b3a to be degenerate with \u03b30 indicating probably that\na weak lensing experiment is insensible to the variation of the growth index with\nredshift; this can be also seen in Fig. 4 where the errors of the growth index are\nbasically the same for all the redshift bins above z ' 1. In Tab. 5 we report the\nerrors for the parameters introduced above for all the three surveys.\nWe reach a sensitivity of about \u03c3w0 = 0.018, \u03c3w0 = 0.068 and \u03c3w0 = 0.122 for\nthe galaxy power spectrum cases and WL survey, respectively. These errors are\nsufficiently small to rule out independently most of the models we considered in this\npaper, see Fig. 5 where we also plot the expected values of the equation of state\nparameters w0 \u2212 wa and the growth index \u03b30 \u2212 \u03b3a for the alternative cosmological\nmodels: quintessence model (yellow box), DGP (blue diamond), LTB (black triangle)\nand f (R) model (brown inverted triangle). Only a measurement of the equation of\nstate parameter is able to rule out wCDM, DGP and LTB model; however, f (R)\nis almost indistinguishable from the reference cosmology and none of the surveys\nassumed here are able to rule it out. Fortunately it is also possible to measure the\ngrowth index \u03b30 ; in this case we reach a sensitivity of about 0.02, 0.092 and 0.075 for\nthe galaxy power spectrum cases and WL survey, respectively.

However, since we are dealing with two different surveys\nwe can consider measuring one set of parameters for each experiment; for example,\nwe can measure w0 \u2212 wa with the WL survey and \u03b30 \u2212 \u03b3a with a P (k) experiment.

Giving a direct dependence to the growth index \u03b3 on the\nequation of state parameters the errors on w0 \u2212 wa are reduced by a factor 4 for the\nP (k) case, a factor 10 for the mP (k) and of about a factor 2 for WL.

All these proposals fall into four main categories: i) the\ninclusion of some extra field (scalar, vector or tensor), coupled or not to the rest of matter,\nlike in quintessence, chameleon, vector dark energy or massive gravity; ii) the extension\nof GR by inclusion of higher order terms in the Einsten-Hilbert action, like f (R) theories,\nGauss-Bonnet terms, etc.; iii) the modification of gravity on large scales by introduction of\nextra dimensions, like in Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, Kaluza-Klein gravity, etc.; iv) the\nreinterpretation in terms of a nontrivial spatial geometry, like in large-void inhomogeneous\nLTB models.\nAll of these proposals have very specific predictions for the background evolution of\ncosmological space-times, and most of them can be well fitted to the present observations,\nwith just a few phenomenological parameters: the equation of state, the speed of sound,\nthe coupling between DM and DE, bulk viscosity, etc. However, in order to discriminate\nbetween the different alternatives it has been realized that one has to go beyond the background evolution and start to consider also the theory of linear cosmological perturbations\nand parametrize their evolution in terms of the growth function and growth index, as well\nas the shift parameter.\nIn this paper we provide exact solutions to the cosmological matter perturbation equation in a homogeneous FLRW universe with a vacuum energy that can be parametrized with\na variable equation of state parameter w(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a). We compute the growth index \u03b3 = log f (a)/ log \u03a9m (a), and its redshift dependence, using the exact solutions in terms\nof Legendre polynomials and show that it can be parametrized as \u03b3(a) = \u03b30 + \u03b3a (1 \u2212 a)\nfor most cases, see Fig. 2. We then compare four different types of dark energy models:\nw\u039bCDM, DGP, f (R) and a LTB-large-void model, which have very different behaviors at\n> 1, see Fig. 7. This allows us to study the possibility to differentiate between various\nz\u223c\nalternatives using full sky deep surveys like Euclid, which will measure both photometric\nand spectroscopic redshifts for several million galaxies up to redshift z = 2. We do a Fisher\nmatrix analysis for the prospects of differentiating among the different DE models in terms\nof the growth index, taken as a given function of redshift or with a principal component\nanalysis, with a value for each redshift bin, see also [74, 75] for a similar analysis for DGP\nand f (R) models. We use as observables the complete and marginalized power spectrum of\ngalaxies P (k) and the Weak Lensing (WL) power spectrum. We find that using P (k) one\ncan reach (2%, 5%) errors in (w0 , wa ) and (4%, 12%) errors in (\u03b30 , \u03b3a ), while using WL we\nget errors at least twice as large. These estimates allow us to differentiate easily between\nDGP, f (R) Starobinsky model and \u039bCDM, see Fig. 7, while it would be more difficult to\ndistinguish the latter from a variable wCDM or LTB models using only the growth index.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\f0.8\n\nDGP\nLTB\n\n\u0393HzL\n\n0.6\n\nLCDM\n\nwCDM\n\n0.4\n\nfS HRL\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nz\n\nFigure 7: The redshift evolution of the growth index compared with the expected errors\nfrom a Euclid-like survey.

The master equation for the perturbations in the small\nscale regime (i.e.: large wave number k) (3.7) can be solved by changing the independent\nvariable from time to the scale factor,\n3\na2 \u03b4 00 (a) + (3 \u2212 \u000f(a)) a \u03b4 0 (a) \u2212 \u03a9m (a) \u03b4(a) = 0 .\n2\nwhere \u000f is given by\n\u000f(a) = \u2212\n\n\u0010\n\u0011i\naH 0\n3h\n= 1 + w(a) 1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a)\nH\n2\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n(A.1)\n\n(A.2)\n\n\fFurthermore, by noting that the density contrast for pure matter grows like \u03b4(a) \u221d a, one\ncan write the general function\n\u03b4(a) = a * G(a) ,\n(A.3)\nwith which the master equation becomes\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3\na2 G00 (a) + 5 \u2212 \u000f(a) a G0 (a) + 3 \u2212 \u000f(a) \u2212 \u03a9m (a) G(a) = 0 .\n2\n\n(A.4)\n\nNow we make a change of variables,\nu=\u2212\n\n\u03a9de,0 \u22123w\na\n,\n\u03a9m,0\n\n=\u21d2\n\na\n\nd\nd\n= \u22123w u ,\nda\ndu\n\n\u03a9m (a) =\n\n1\n,\n1\u2212u\n\nand thus the master equation becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u00103\n5\n5 \u0011\n1\u2212w\nG(u) = 0 ,\nu(1 \u2212 u)G00 (u) + 1 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nu G0 (u) \u2212\n6w\n2 6w\n6w2\n\n(A.5)\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhich has the form of a Hypergeometric equation, see Ref.[23], with constant coefficients\n\u03b1 = (w \u2212 1)/2w, \u03b2 = \u22121/3w, \u03b3 = 1 \u2212 5/6w, and thus the exact solutions are written in\nterms of two independent constants, C1 and C2 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a9de,0 \u22123w\nw \u2212 1 \u22121\n5\n\u03b4(a) = C1 a * 2F1\n,\n,1 \u2212\n;\u2212\na\n(A.7)\n2w 3w\n6w\n\u03a9m,0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a9de,0 \u22123w\n1 1\n1\n5\n\u22123/2\n+ C2 a\n* 2F1\n, +\n,1 +\n;\u2212\na\n.\n2w 2 3w\n6w\n\u03a9m,0\nThe first term corresponds to the growing mode solution and the second one to the decaying\nmode. When describing late time solutions we will always take the growing mode solution;\nfurthermore, the integration constant C1 is not a problem, as in this work we are interested\nin the evolution of the growth rate f (a) which is the ratio of the matter density and its\nderivative.\nThere are a number of way that one can play with the solution above in order to simplify\nthe Hypergeometric function and even to drop the Hypergeometric functions. Here we use\none relation which seems to be the easiest among all the others; we can notice that the\nthird coefficient \u03b3 of the Hypergeometric function can be written as:\n\u03b3=\n\n1\n+\u03b1+\u03b2\n2\n\n(A.8)\n\nbeing \u03b1 and \u03b2 the first and second coefficient of the Hypergeometric function. In this case\nthe solution for the matter density contrast can be written in terms of Legendre polynomials. However, being our goal to find an exact solution for the growth rate and growth\nindex, we find easier to first evaluate these terms using the Hypergeometric functions and\nthen to simplify the result.

It is fair to be said that in the last case there is no exact analytic solution for the\nmatter density contrast as it was for the case in which w is constant; the main problem\nhere is that there is no a direct transformation between the scale factor a and the new\nvariable u.\nHere we assume the equation of state parameter to be:\nw(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a) ,\n\n(A.13)\n\nfor which the matter density parameter can be integrated\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a9de,0 \u22123(w0 +wa ) 3wa (a\u22121) \u22121\na\ne\n,\n\u03a9m (a) = 1 +\n\u03a9m,0\n\n(A.14)\n\nThe master equation for a varying equation of state parameter still looks the same as\nEq.
