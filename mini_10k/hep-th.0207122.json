The method used is SDLCQ (supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization). An application to N = 1 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory in 2+1\ndimensions at large Nc is summarized. The addition of a Chern\u2013Simons term is\nalso discussed.\n\n1. Introduction\nAlthough much has been learned about supersymmetric gauge theories by\nanalytic methods, numerical methods can yield much more of the nonperturbative structure. In particular, the method known as supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ),1,2 an extension of ordinary\nDLCQ,3,4 has been quite successful in the analysis of (1+1)-dimensional\nsupersymmetric theories. This work has recently been extended to 2+1\ndimensions5,6,7,8 with consideration of N = 1 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills\n(SYM) theory, including a Chern\u2013Simons (CS) term.9 The mass spectrum,\nFock-state wave functions, and a stress-energy correlator are all computed.\nThe CS term provides an effective mass that reduces the tendency of SYM\nto produce stringy states with many constituents. This work was done at\nlarge-Nc, but the method is also applicable to finite Nc .\nAs the name SDLCQ implies, light-cone coordinates10 are used. They\nare defined by spacetime coordinates\n\u221a\n(1)\nx\u00b1 = (t \u00b1 z)/ 2 , x\u22a5 = (x, y)\n\u2217 Preprint UMN-D-02-4, to appear in the proceedings of the fifth workshop on Continuous\nAdvances in QCD (Arkadyfest), Minneapolis, Minnesota, May 17-23, 2002.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nand momentum components\n\u221a\np\u00b1 = (E \u00b1 pz )/ 2 , p\u22a5 = (px , py ) .\n\n(2)\n\nThe dot product of two such four-vectors then becomes\np * x = p+ x\u2212 + p\u2212 x+ \u2212 p\u22a5 * x\u22a5 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe x+ direction is treated as the direction of time evolution, which makes\nthe conjugate variable p\u2212 the light-cone energy. The light-cone threemomentum is p \u2261 (p+ , p\u22a5 ). In a frame where the net transverse momentum\nP\u22a5 is zero, the mass eigenvalue problem becomes\n2P + P \u2212 |P i = M 2 |P i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |P i is also an eigenstate of three-momentum P . The SDLCQ method\nprovides a means to solve this eigenvalue problem with supersymmetry\npreserved exactly at any level of the approximation.\nOne of the advantages of light-cone coordinates is that there exists a\nwell-defined Fock-state expansion for each mass eigenstate. There are no\ndisconnected vacuum pieces, because the longitudinal momentum of each\nconstituent, virtual or real, must be positive. SDLCQ uses a Fock-state\nexpansion for |P i to obtain a matrix eigenvalue problem for the Fock-state\nwave functions at discrete values of the momentum. The matrix is then\ndiagonalized by appropriate means. For large matrices the Lanczos diagonalization technique11 has been used, as discussed in Ref. [ 6].\nThe discretization is accomplished by restricting the fields to periodic\nboundary conditions in a light-cone box3,4 defined by \u2212Lk < x\u2212 < Lk and\n0 < x, y < L\u22a5 . This leads to a discrete momentum grid\np+ \u2192\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\nnx ,\nny ) .\nn , p\u22a5 \u2192 (\nLk\nL\u22a5\nL\u22a5\n\n(5)\n\nThe product P + P \u2212 is independent of Lk , and the limit Lk \u2192 \u221e is exchanged for a limit in terms of an integer K, called the harmonic resolution,3\ndefined by\nK\u2261\n\nLk +\nP .\n\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nLongitudinal momentum fractions x = p+ /P + then reduce to n/K. The\nnumber of particles in a Fock state is limited to K, because negative longitudinal momentum is not allowed and the individual integers n must sum to\nK.a The eigenvalue equation (4) becomes a coupled set of integral equations\na Zero\n\nmodes are ignored.\n\n\f3\n\nfor the Fock-state wave functions in which the integrals are approximated\nby discrete sums over the momentum grid\n\u0012\n\u00132 X\nZ\nZ\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n+\n2\n+\ndp\nd p\u22a5 f (p , p\u22a5 ) \u2243\nf (nP + /K, 2n\u22a5 \u03c0/L\u22a5 ) . (7)\nLk L\u22a5\nn,n ,n\nx\n\ny\n\nThe harmonic resolution provides a natural cutoff for n. The transverse\nsums must be truncated explicitly, which is done by limiting nx and ny to\nrange from \u2212T to T . The integer T can be viewed as a transverse cutoff or,\nat fixed dimensionful cutoff \u039b\u22a5 \u2261 2\u03c0T /L\u22a5, as the transverse resolution.\nThe distinction between DLCQ and SDLCQ lies in the choice of operator\nfor discretization. In ordinary DLCQ one discretizes the Hamiltonian, P \u2212 ;\nin SDLCQ, one discretizes the supercharge Q\u2212 and constructs P \u2212 from the\nsuperalgebra relation\n\u221a\n(8)\n{Q\u2212 , Q\u2212 } = 2 2P \u2212 ,\nwhich guarantees that the discrete eigenvalue problem preserves\nsupersymmetry.1,2 The P \u2212 of ordinary DLCQ differs from the supersymmetric P \u2212 by terms which disappear in the large-K limit but which break\nthe supersymmetry at finite K.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, (2+1)dimensional SYM theory is reviewed and numerical results discussed for the\nspectrum and for a correlator of the stress-energy tensor. Section 3 extends\nthe study of the spectrum to include the CS term, in both a dimensionally\nreduced theory and the full (2+1)-dimensional case. A brief summary is\ngiven in Sec. 4.\n2.

In\nparticular, the spectrum as a function of g separates into two bands, one\nof approximately constant M 2 L2\u22a5 and the other growing rapidly.\nFor states in the lower band, thep\naverage number of constituents increases rapidly with g. At g \u2243 1.5 4\u03c0 3 /Nc L\u22a5 the DLCQ limit of K\nconstituents is saturated. Thus in SYM theory the low-mass states are\ndominated by Fock states with many constituents, in close correspondence\nwith string theory. However, as a practical matter, the saturation means\nthat the SDLCQ approximation breaks down, and numerical studies in this\nband must be limited to smaller couplings.\nWithin the coupling limitation, extrapolations to infinite resolution are\neasily done for low-mass states. One first considers M 2 as a function of 1/T\nfor a sequence of fixed K values. The extrapolations to T = \u221e then yield\nM 2 as a function of 1/K alone, to extrapolate to K = \u221e. The different\nrepresentatives of continuum eigenstates are disentangled by studying their\nproperties, such as average constituent content and momentum. Of course,\nthe different P and S symmetry sectors are explicitly separated at the start.\nTypical extrapolations are illustrated in Ref. [ 6] with plots in Figs. 4-8 and\nresults in Tables II and III.\nFor the spectrum as a whole there is a curious behavior with respect to\nthe average number of fermion constituents hnF i. Calculations for transverse resolution T = 1 and longitudinal resolutions K = 5 and 6, and for\nmany different coupling strengths, show a gap between hnF i = 4 and 6,\nwhere no state is found.\nWave functions are also obtained in the diagonalization process. In\nthe analysis of the spectrum they were used to compute various average\nquantities that helped identify states computed at different resolutions.\nMore of the form of the wave function is revealed in the structure function\n\uf8f6\n! \uf8eb q\nq\nK\u2212q\nT\nK\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\uf8f8\nn\u22a5\nni \u2212 K \u03b4 \uf8ed\n\u03b4\ngA (n, n\u22a5 ) =\nj\n\u22a5\nq=2 n1 ,...,nq =1 n\u22a5\n1 ,...,nq =\u2212T\n\n\u00d7\n\nq\nX\nl=1\n\nn\u22a5\n\ni=1\n\nA\n\u22a5 2\nl\n\u03b4nnl \u03b4n\u22a5\n\u03b4A\n|\u03c8(n1 , n\u22a5\n1 ; . . . ; nq , nq )| ,\nl\n\nj=1\n\n(19)\n\nwhere A and Al represent the statistics (bosonic or fermionic) of the probed\ntype and the l-th constituent, respectively, and \u03c8 is a Fock-state wave function. In the lower band the shapes are typically simple and are found to\n\n\f6\n\nconfirm the identification of states at different resolutions. In the upper\nband, there are complicated shapes with multiple bumps in transverse momentum, such as in Figs. 13 and 14 of Ref. [ 6].\n2.3. Stress-energy correlator\nConsider the following correlator of the stress-energy component T ++ :\nF (x+ , x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) \u2261 h0|T ++ (x+ , x\u2212 , x\u22a5 )T ++ (0, 0, 0)|0i ,\n\n(20)\n\nat strong coupling,7 as an example of what one might compare with a\nsupergravity approximation to string theory for small curvature.13 In the\ndiscrete approximation, F can be written as\n!2\nX\n\u03c0\n+\n\u2212\n(21)\nF (x , x , 0) =\n2L2k L\u22a5\nn,m,s,t\n\u00d7h0|\nwhere\nLk ++\nT (n, m)|0i =\n\u03c0\n\nLk\n\u2212 +\n+ \u2212 Lk\nT (n, m)e\u2212iPop x \u2212iP x\nT (s, t)|0i ,\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n\u221a\ni\nnm h \u2020\ntr aij (n, n\u22a5 )a\u2020ji (m, m\u22a5 ) |0i\n2\ni\n(n \u2212 m) h \u2020\ntr bij (n, n\u22a5 )b\u2020ji (m, m\u22a5 ) |0i .\n+\n4\n\n(22)\n\nInsertion of a complete set of bound states |\u03b1i with light-cone energies\nP\u03b1\u2212 = (M\u03b12 + P\u22a52 )/P + at resolution K (and therefore P + = \u03c0K/Lk ) and\nwith total transverse momentum P\u22a5 = 2T \u03c0/L\u22a5 yields\n\u0012 \u2212 \u00132\n9/2\nX\n1\n|hu|\u03b1i|2\n1\nx\nM\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nF (x+ , x\u2212 , 0) =\n,\nK\n(M\nr)\n\u03b1\n9/2\n+\nL\u22a5 K 3 |Nu |2\nr\n2(2\u03c0)5/2\n\u2212i x\n\u03b1\n(23)\n\nwith r2 = x+ x\u2212 , x\u22a5 = 0, and\nLk X\n|ui = Nu\n\u03b4n+m,K \u03b4n\u22a5 +m\u22a5 ,N\u22a5 T (n, m)|0i .\n\u03c0 n,m\n\n(24)\n\nHere Nu is a normalization factor such that hu|ui = 1. The sum over the\nfull set of eigenvalues can be avoided by a Lanczos-based technique.14\nFor free particles, (x+ /x\u2212 )2 F has a 1/r6 behavior.7 In the interacting\ncase, this behavior should be recovered for small r, where the bound states\nbehave as free particles. Because this behavior depends on having a mass\nspectrum that extends to infinity, the finite resolution of the numerical\n\n\f7\n\ncalculation yields only 1/r5 ; however, the 1/r6 behavior is recovered in a\ncareful limiting process.\nThe behavior for large r is determined by the massless states. Because\nthis theory has zero central charge, there are exactly massless Bogomol'nyi\u2013\nPrasad\u2013Sommerfield (BPS) states at any coupling. However, their wave\nfunctions remain sensitive to the coupling, and, at a particular (resolution\ndependent) value of g, the correlator is exactly zero in the large-r limit.\nThe associated 'critical' value of g increases in proportion to the square\nroot of the transverse resolution T .7\n3. SYM-CS theory\nThe following CS term can be added to the Lagrangian:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2i\n\u03ba\nLCS = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb A\u03bc \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb + gA\u03bc A\u03bd A\u03bb + \u03ba\u03a8\u0304\u03a8 .\n2\n3\nThis induces an additional term in the supercharge\nZ\n1\n3/4\n\u03baQ\u2212\n\u2261\n\u22122\n\u03ba\ndx\u2212 \u2202\u2212 \u03c6 \u03c8 ,\nCS\n\u2202\u2212\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nwhich generates in P \u2212 terms proportional to \u03ba2 that act like a constituent\nmass squared. The presence of an effective mass reduces the tendency for\nlow-mass states to be composed of high-multiplicity Fock states. This creates a theory in which the eigenstates are more likely to be QCD-like, i.e.\nvalence dominated, and improves the applicability of the SDLCQ approximation to a greater range of couplings.15,16,8\nThe dominance of the valence state is most prominent in the dimensionally reduced theory.15 This (1+1)-dimensional theory is obtained by\nrequiring the fields to be constant in the transverse direction and replacing\n\u2212\n\u2202\u22a5 by zero in the full supercharge Q\u2212\nSYM + \u03baQCS . The SYM contribution\nis then proportional to g. Figure 3 of Ref. [ 15] illustrates the dramatic reduction in the average number of constituents as the ratio \u03ba/g is increased.\nAlso, there are states for which the mass is nearly independent of g at fixed\n\u03ba. These are identified as approximate BPS states and are the reflection\nof the massless BPS states in the underlying SYM theory.16 This behavior\ncan be seen in Fig. 1 of Ref. [ 16].\nSimilar anomalously light states appear in the full (2+1)-dimensional\ntheory.8 The bulk of the spectrum is driven to large M 2 values as g is increased, but one or more states remain at low values. The presence of the\ntransverse degree of freedom makes this more difficult to disentangle numerically, because the matrices are larger and because one must consider the\n\n\f8\n\ntransverse resolution limit. Also, the eigenstates are less valence-dominated\nat stronger YM coupling, which makes the SDLCQ approximation less useful. However, structure functions have been extracted at intermediate coupling to show that the approximate BPS states have a distinctly flat dependence in longitudinal momentum. Figure 3b of Ref. [ 8] gives an example\nof this behavior.\n4. Summary\nThis work shows that one can compute spectra, wave functions, and matrix\nelements nonperturbatively in supersymmetric theories. The introduction\nof a Chern\u2013Simons term brings an effective constituent mass which has the\neffect of reducing the tendency of SYM theory to form stringy, low-mass\nstates with many constituents. Instead, the lowest-mass states tend to be\ndominated by their valence Fock state. The massless BPS states of SYM\ntheory survive in SYM-CS theory as states with masses nearly independent\nof the YM coupling.\nA number of interesting issues remain to be explored. They include\ntheories in 3+1 dimensions, matter in the fundamental representation,17\nand supersymmetry breaking. All of these are important for making contact\nwith QCD.\nAcknowledgments\nThis talk was based on work done in collaboration with S.S.
