Reasons for this interest stem from shell\nclosure effects at N = 50, the subshell closure at N = 56\nand an onset of large deformation for the nuclei with N\n\u2265 60. A systematic study of the properties of a series of\nneutron-rich isotopes of rubidium, strontium, zirconium\nand molybdenum reveals a rapidly changing behavior in\nnuclear structure in the region of neutron number 58 \u2264\nN \u2264 61. This behavior has been studied experimentally\nusing several methods employing \u03b2-decay [1], \u03b3-ray measurements [2], collinear laser spectroscopy [3] and most\nrecently direct mass measurements [4]. The deformation\neffect is dominant in the strontium and zirconium isotope\nchains where the onset of deformation is characterized by\na breaking of a smooth trend of two-neutron separation\nenergies.\nSystematic theoretical calculations employing the Hartree Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) model predict that the strontium, zirconium and molybdenum nuclei with N \u2264 58 are\nnearly spherical in shape whereas those with N \u223c 60 prefer a highly deformed prolate shape [5]. The JYFLTRAP\nprecise experimental observations indicate this occurrence\n[4]. Extension of this knowledge of deformation changes\ntowards the lower Z region is of particular interest in the\npresent study of rubidium and bromine isotopes.\nAdditional motivation for this work derives from the\nrapid neutron capture process (r-process) on heavy elements. The r-process is considered to be responsible for\nthe synthesis of the heavy elements beyond iron (Z \u2265 26)\nSend offprint requests to:\na\nE-mail address: saidur.rahaman@phys.jyu.fi\n\nStable\nJYFLTRAP\n24\n3\nT = 1.5 GK, N n = 10 / cm\n28\n3\nT = 1.0 GK, N n = 10 / cm\n\n55\n\n50\n\nproton number\n\narXiv:nucl-ex/0703017v1 12 Mar 2007\n\nPrecise atomic masses of neutron-rich Br and Rb nuclei close to\nthe r-process path\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\nneutron number\n\nFig. 1. The neutron-rich nuclei (empty circles) investigated\nat JYFLTRAP and the two r-process paths [13, 14] at two different temperatures and neutron densities. The rubidium and\nbromine isotopes studied in this article are indicated by filled\ngrey circles.\n\nand approximately half of all nuclear species in nature are\nproduced via this process. In a good approximation the\nneutron capture reactions proceed in a (n, \u03b3) \u2194 (\u03b3, n)\nequilibrium, fixing the r-process reaction path at rather\nlow neutron separation energies of about 2 to 3 MeV [6].\nThe majority of nuclei in the r-process path are not\naccessible experimentally, therefore the theoretical calculations involve extensive extrapolations in the direction of\nheavier and more neutron-rich isotopes. For reliable nucleosynthesis calculations, nuclear masses (or the neutron\nseparation energy Sn ), half-lives and beta-decay Q values\nare important parameters [7]. To first order, the values of\n\n\f2\n\nS. Rahaman, et al.: Precise atomic masses of neutron-rich Br and Rb nuclei close to the r-process path\n\nSn determine the r-process path and the values of the halflives determine the shape of the abundance curve. Thus\nthe nuclear mass is one of the important nuclear parameters for the r-process calculations.\nThe study of nuclear properties via precision atomic\nmass measurements of exotic nuclei is an important part\nof the JYFLTRAP setup at the Ion-Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility [8] in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. So far,\nneutron-rich isotopes of Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr,\nMo, Tc, Ru, Rh and Pd have been investigated [4,9,10,11,\n12]. Two r-process paths calculated by using the canonical model [13,14] and the neutron-rich nuclei investigated\nat JYFLTRAP are shown in Fig. 1. Some of the investigated nuclei at JYFLTRAP are directly recline on the\nr-process paths. In this paper experiments on neutron-rich\nRb and Br isotopes around the mass region A \u223c 100 will\nbe presented and discussed. The masses of Br and Rb isotopic chains were previously measured employing \u03b2-decay\nendpoint energies and using a dipole mass spectrometer,\nrespectively. Recently ISOLTRAP [15] has also measured\nmasses of neutron-rich Kr isotopes up to 95 Kr.\n\n2 Experimental setup and procedure\n2.1 JYFLTRAP\nJYFLTRAP [16] is an ion trap experiment for cooling,\nbunching, isobaric purification and precision mass measurements of radioactive ions produced at the IGISOL facility. In this work radioactive nuclides were produced in\na proton-induced fission reaction by bombarding a thin\n(15 mg/cm2 ) natural uranium target with a 30 MeV proton beam of average intensity of 7 \u03bcA from the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4\nK-130 cyclotron. The production rates of the studied nuclides varied from 10,000 ions/s to 100 ions/s for the most\nexotic isotope. The ions were extracted from the gas cell\nby helium gas flow into a differential pumping stage where\nthey were accelerated to 30 keV and mass-separated with\na 550 dipole magnet. The ions were transported to the\nJYFLTRAP setup where they were efficiently cooled and\ncleaned from possible isobaric contaminants before their\nmass was measured. To perform this process JYFLTRAP\nconsists of two main components as shown in fig. 2, a\nhelium-filled RFQ cooler & buncher [17,18,19] and two\ncylindrical Penning traps in one 7 T superconducting magnet.\nThe ions delivered to the RFQ cooler & buncher were\ncooled, accumulated and finally bunched at a low kinetic\nenergy with an emittance of 3 \u03c0-mm-mrad (measured at\n38 keV) [20]. These ion bunches were transported to the\nPenning trap system. The traps are placed in the homogeneous regions of the magnet separated by 20 cm. The\nfirst trap, called the purification trap is filled with helium\ngas at a pressure of about 10\u22125 mbar and is dedicated to\nisobaric cleaning using a mass selective buffer gas cooling\ntechnique [21]. The second trap, the precision trap has a\nresidual pressure of about 10\u22128 mbar. It is used for high\nprecision mass measurements using the time-of-flight ion\ncyclotron resonance technique [22].\n\n-5\n\n10 mbar\n\n10\n\n-8\n\nmbar\n\n7T magnet\n-3\n\n10\n\nIGISOL\nbeam\n\nmbar\n\nMCP\ndetector\n\nTransfer line\n\nRFQ cooler\n\nPurification\ntrap\n\n30 kV\n\nPrecision\ntrap\n\n800 V\n\n-Accumulation\n-Cooling and bunching\n\n97 V\n\n-Isobaric\nseparation\n\n-Mass\nmeasurement\n\nFig. 2. A schematic drawing of the JYFLTRAP setup. The\nmain components are the RFQ cooler & buncher and two cylindrical Penning traps. The Penning traps are inside a single 7\nT superconducting solenoid. A microchannel plate (MCP) detector is placed at the end of the setup which is at ground\npotential.\n\nThe cooled and bunched ions from the RFQ buncher\nwere captured in the purification Penning trap and further cooled by the collisions with helium atoms, finally\nbeing stored at the axial potential mimima of the trap.\nPossible isobaric contaminations were removed by applying successive RF dipole and quadrupole excitations in\nthe presence of the helium gas. As a result, the ions of\ninterest were centered when the applied quadrupole excitation frequency was close to the ion cyclotron frequency.\nA cycle time of about 400 ms was used in the purification\ntrap and a mass resolving power of about 105 was reached\nwith this configuration.\nThe isobarically purified and cooled ions were transported to the precision trap. RF dipole excitation at the\nion's magnetron frequency (\u03bd\u2212 ) was applied in order to enhance the magnetron radius employing the phase-locking\ntechnique [23]. The RF quadrupole excitation was then\napplied at the sum frequency \u03bdc = \u03bd+ + \u03bd\u2212 to convert\nthe slow magnetron motion to the reduced cyclotron motion with a higher radial energy. \u03bdc and \u03bd+ are the cyclotron and reduced cyclotron frequency of the ions respectively. The excitation time varied from 150 ms to 800\nms (see table 1). Finally, the ions were ejected from the\ntrap. They drift towards the microchannel plate (MCP)\ndetector through a set of drift tubes where a strong magnetic field gradient exists. Here the ions experience a force\nwhich converts the radial kinetic energy of the ions into\nlongitudinal energy additional to the 30 keV acceleration\nfrom the high-voltage platform to the ground potential\nwhere the MCP is situated. As a result an ion which was\nin resonance with the applied excitation quadrupole field\nmoves faster towards the detector than an ion which was\noff resonance. By measuring the time of flight as a function of the applied excitation frequency, the cyclotron frequency \u03bdc was determined. A typical time-of-flight resonance spectrum is shown in fig. 3. This spectrum yields\nthe ion cyclotron frequency\n1 q\nB,\n(1)\n2\u03c0 m\nwhere B is the magnetic field, m is the mass and q the\ncharge state of the ion. To calibrate the magnetic field, the\ncyclotron frequency (\u03bdcref ) of a precisely known reference\n\u03bdc =\n\n\fS.

The cyclotron frequency of the reference\nions was plotted as a function of time. Two consecutive\n400\nreference frequencies were not deviated by each other more\nthan 50 mHz. Experimental study showed that this fluctuation is random and a deviation of 50 mHz was derived\n350\nfrom the plot. This uncertainty was added quadratically to\nthe statistical uncertainty of each measured frequency.

An average Q\u03b2 = 8970(130) keV\nand a mass excess value of -70730(120) keV was derived.\nIt was also investigated by M. Gross et al. [28] yielding almost the same mass excess value. The JYFLTRAP value\n-70716(4) keV is in good agreement with the previous values. 88 Br has an isomeric state at an energy of 272.7 keV\nwith a half life of 5.4 \u03bcs. The ground state mass measurement will not be affected by such a short-lived isomeric\nstate since it will decay before reaching the Penning trap\nsystem.\n3.1.5\n\n89\n\n90\n\nThe beta spectrum observed in coincidence with the 3231\nkeV \u03b3 transition of 90 Kr yielded an average Q\u03b2 of 9800(400)\nkeV and the mass excess of -65400(400) keV. Another\nexperiment by M. Gross et al. on the beta endpoint energy provided a mass excess value of -64660(80) keV. The\nJYFLTRAP value -64001(4) keV differs by 619 keV from\nthe value adopted in the AME03 Mass Table. The difference of nearly 8 standard deviations can be due to various\nreasons. Firstly, a low statistics beta spectrum can easily yield an MeV error in an endpoint energy determination. Secondly, the energy levels of 90 Kr are poor known.\nRecently, the measured mass value of the 90 Kr did not\nimprove the observed deviation as indicated in table 3.\n\n3.1.7\n\n91\n\nBr\n\nThe mass value of 91 Br has been determined at the ISOLDE\nII mass separator by studying the end-point energy of the\nbeta spectrum measured by M. Graefenstedt et al. in 1989\n[30]. The beta spectrum observed in coincidence with a set\nof gated \u03b3 transitions was obtained giving an average Q\u03b2\nof 9790(100) keV and a mass value of -61565(115) keV. M.\nGross et al. deduced a mass excess value of -61545(75) keV\nfrom the beta endpoint energy. The JYFLTRAP value, 61108(4) keV differs from this value by as much as 400\nkeV. Considering the new mass value of the 91 Kr this deviation is reduced to 67 keV tabulated in table 3.\n\n3.1.8\n\n92\n\nBr\n\nOur measured mass excess value of -56233(7) keV differs\nfrom the AME03 value by 350 keV. The AME03 value is\nbased on the previous measurements by M. Graefenstedt\net al. in 1989 [30] and M. Gross et al. in 1992 [28]. The large\ndifference of 7 standard deviations cannot be understood\nbut could have similar origins as discussed before for 90 Br.\n\nBr\n\nSpectroscopic investigations of 89 Br nuclei have been performed extensively by P. Hoff et al. [29] in 1981 using a\nmolecular ion 27 Al89 Br+ . The endpoint energy was derived from the observed beta spectra in coincidence with\nselected \u03b3 transitions in 89 Kr having an energy more than\n4 MeV and possessing strong \u03b2 branches. An average Q\u03b2 =\n8140(140) keV leads to a mass excess value of -68690(150)\nkeV. M. Gross et al. [28] also investigated the beta endpoint energy of 89 Br. Our measured value -68275(4) keV\ndiffers by 295 keV or 5 standard deviations from the value\nadopted in AME03. This deviation is reduced to 100 keV\ntaking into account the 89 Kr mass value measured recently\nat ISOLTRAP[15] (see table 3).\n3.1.6\n\n5\n\nBr\n\nThe mass excess value of 90 Br was determined from the\nendpoint energy of a beta spectrum by P.

In the 1982 run inconsistencies arose in the evaluation of 94 Rb. This finally lead to\nthe suggestion of the existence of two short-lived isomers,\nhowever this was not confirmed by any other experiment.\nFinally, it was confirmed that the 94 Rb beam was contaminated. Other direct mass measurements took place at the\nPrism mass spectrometer (PMC) consistent with the Orsay measurements [33]. The mass of 94 Rb was also determined at ISOLDE using the Penning trap mass spectrometer with an uncertainty of 9 keV [34]. The JYFLTRAP\nvalue -68564(5) keV is in excellent agreement with all previous measurements.\n\n\f6\n\nS.

Discrepancy\nwith the older values as discussed in section 3 and summarized in figs. 4, 5 and 6 indicated deviations from the\nprevious values of up to 600 keV. The shortest lived isotope measured has a half-life of 170 ms (97 Rb). The new\nJYFLTRAP data provides significant improvements in the\nknowledge of experimental masses. In the following we will\nuse these data to highlight possible shell structure effects\nfar from stability by viewing the systematics of the two\nneutron-separation energies and by comparing the results\nwith a few selected mass models.\n4.1 Comparison with mass models\nIt is necessary to compare the models with experimental\ndata for their further development and to improve their\npredictive power for the region far from stability, where\n\n\fS.

For comparison, we have chosen five leading\nnuclear mass models generally used in the literature [35,\n36] that have reliably reproduced the known masses.\nThe Finite-Range Droplet Model (FRDM) by Peter\nM\u00f6ller et al. [37], belongs to a microscopic and macroscopic (mic-mac) type of calculation. This model contains\ntwo parts, a macroscopic part (based on the liquid-drop\nmodel) and a microscopic part (single-particle model). In\nthe macroscopic part the binding energy is a smooth function of proton number Z and neutron number N, derived\nfrom the liquid-drop model. Microscopic effects are obtained from a deformed single-particle model. The mass\nexcess values calculated according to this model have the\nlargest deviations for both isotope chains investigated in\nthis work as shown in figs. 7 and 8. No significant odd-even\nstaggering is observed in this region.\nThe Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov model (HFB-9) [38] is\nclassified as fully microscopic, since the model is based on\nan effective two-body (nucleon-nucleon) interaction. This\nalso includes pairing energy. The advantage of this model\nis that it permits one to derive all properties of the nucleus\nfrom internucleonic forces. A drawback of this model is\nthat it generally does not succeed in calculating odd nuclei\nwhich is an inconvenience for astrophysics. The odd-even\nstaggering is clearly overestimated in this model and can\nbe seen for Br and Rb isotopes shown in figs. 7 and 8.\nThe Extended Thomas-Fermi and Strutinsky Integral\n(ETFSI) model [39,40] adopted a semi-classical approximation to the Hartree-Fock method which includes full\nStrutinsky shell corrections. They extend Thomas-Fermi\ncalculations to be available for a Skyrme-type (zero-range)\ninteraction and a delta function pairing force incorporating a full Strutinsky integral. Mass excess values calculated according to this model are better relative to the\nprevious two models for the isotopes studied in this work.\nOdd-even staggering is observed but less than that of the\nHFB-9 model.\nAnother mass model [41] called KTUY also has two\nparts and belongs to the mic-mac family. The macroscopic\npart is a smooth function of Z and N based on the liquiddrop model including an average pairing energy. The microscopic part calculates the intrinsic shell energy and the\naverage deformation energy of a deformed nucleus employing a single-particle potential. The mass excesses from this\nmodel agree reasonably well with the JYFLTRAP experimental values both for Br and Rb. For the heaviest Rb\nisotopes, however, a large difference of nearly 1 MeV is\nobserved. Only small odd-even staggering is noticed for N\n= 50-53 in the Br isotope chain and for N = 50-57 in the\nRb isotope chain. It is of interest to note that the KTUY\nmodel fails completely in predicting masses of neutronrich Tc-Pd isotopes as shown by another study performed\nrecently at JYFLTRAP [12].\nThe Duflo and Zuker mass model [42] is more fundamental than the mic-mac approach but it is not yet fully\nmicroscopic since no nucleonic interaction appears explicitly. This model starts with an assumption that there exists an effective interaction (pseudopotential) which makes\n\n7\n\n13\n12\n11\n10\nSr\n\n9\n\nMo\n\nZr\n\nRb\n\n8\n\nBr\n\nKr\n\n7\n49\n\n51\n\n53\n\n55\n\n57\n59\n61\nneutron number\n\n63\n\n65\n\n67\n\nFig. 9.

Finally, it can be written\nas an effective Hamiltonian which contains two parts, a\nmonopole term and a multipole term. The monopole calculations are purely HF-type based on single particle properties while the multipole term acts as a residual interaction and the calculation goes beyond HF. The mass excess for Rb isotopes does not differ significantly for lower\nneutron number but it starts to differ for higher neutron\nnumber. For example this model has a 1 MeV discrepancy\ncompared to experiment at N = 59. The odd-even staggering is noticed for N = 50-53 for the Br isotope chain and\nfor N = 50-55 for the Rb isotope chain but is comparably\nsmaller than for other models.\n4.2 Two neutron separation energies and the shell gap\nFigure 9 displays the two-neutron separation energies (S2n )\nof neutron-rich Br, Kr, Sr, Zr and Mo isotopes derived\nfrom the mass excess values measured by the JYFLTRAP\nand ISOLTRAP setups [4,15]. The data is complemented\nby the values from the AME03[26].\nThe occurrence of nuclear shell effects is clearly observed as a function of neutron number. The main shell\nclosure at N = 50 manifests itself in a steep decrease of\nS2n values for all nuclei with N = 51 and N = 52. A similar change of the slope is observed at the N = 56 neutron\nsubshell closure. This change of the slope is most prominent for Zr due to the fact that Z = 40 is a semi-magic\nproton number. At N = 59 for Zr isotopes the change\nin the slope of the S2n curve shows very clearly a sudden phase transition from a spherical to deformed shape\nof the ground state. This effect is also visible for Sr and\nfor Rb at N = 58 to 60. A similar trend continues in the\ncase of the Mo isotopes that are less deformed than the\nZr isotopes at these neutron numbers. This phenomenon\nhas been interpreted by K. Heyde et al. as due to a co-\n\n\f8\n\nS.

Empty diamonds present the values cited in the Atomic\nMass Evaluation 2003 [26].\n\nexistence of different shapes at low energies [43]. However\nno such conclusion can yet be drawn for the Kr and Br\nchains due to the lack of experimental data in this region.\nFigure 10 shows the experimental neutron separation\nenergies for Br, Rb and Kr. The experimental neutron\ncapture Q-value for 91 Br is 3.20(1) MeV. The value clearly\nindicates that the investigated nuclei are very close to the\nr-process path. Our new mass values in this region will\nsubstantially help to improve the theoretical predictions\nand the network calculations of the r-process path.\nLarge shell gaps are a predominant feature of magic\nnuclei. In the language of the shell model, such magicnumber nuclei have a closed-shell structure leading to their\npronounced stability. This phenomenon is well understood\nfor the ground states of nuclei close to the valley of \u03b2stability. However, the situation seems to be quite different\nfor highly unstable nuclei. One example is that of abnormal neutron to proton number ratios. Several theoretical\ncalculations and experimental results have shown indications of a quenching of the N0 = 20 shell in neutron-rich\nisotopes [44,45,46]. Also the N0 = 50 shell gap has been\npredicted by different mass models [47,48] to be reduced\ntowards Z \u223c 28. This phenomenon has been explained by\nrefs. [44,49] and can be understood from a single particle\nspectrum. In the case of nuclei far from the stability line,\nthe single particle spectrum is wider, therefore for these\nnuclei the neutron pairing energy will be enhanced and,\nas a result, the shell-gaps are weakened.\nThe shell-gap energy (\u2206(N 0 )) can be calculated by\nusing the one or two neutron separation energies\n\u2206(N0 )2n = S2n (Z, N0 ) \u2212 S2n (Z, N0 + 2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N0 defines the magic neutron number. Figure 11\ndisplays two regions of interest regarding the present work\nand other recent data. The JYFLTRAP values from this\nwork, previous work and the new ISOLTRAP values for\nKr are included in this plot [4,10,15]. Our \u2206(N0 )2n data\nfor Z = 35 at N0 = 50 confirm the data that showed a\nclear trend towards the shell quenching as predicted by\nseveral models. At N0 = 56 and Z = 40 an enhanced\nshell gap energy is observed as expected because of both\nneutron and proton subshell closures. When comparing\nthe N0 = 50 and N0 = 56 shell gaps (calculated according\nto Eq. 3) the effect for N0 = 56 is more pronounced. The\ngap is reduced by about a factor of two from Z = 40 to\nZ = 35. On the contrary, the change in the \u2206(N0 )1n shell\ngap energies are considerably smaller. For N0 = 56 no\nessentials reduction of the shell gap is observed down to\nZ = 35.\nA large scattering of the shell gap values calculated by\ndifferent models is observed for the N 0 = 50 shell closures.\nThe \u2206(N0 = 50)2n data is reasonably well reproduced by\nKTUY, FRDM, ETFSI models whereas no or only weak\nreduction is given by the Duflo and Zucker and HFB-9\nmodels. None of the models can reproduced the observed\nshell gap energies at N = 56.\n\n5 Conclusions\nThe masses of 85\u221292 Br and 94\u221297 Rb isotopes have been\nmeasured in the neighborhood of the r-process path with\na relative precision of about 10\u22128 . A significant deviation\nis observed compared to the older data for Br isotopes.\nThe model mass excess values have an offset with the\nJYFLTRAP mass excess values of about 400 keV for the\nBr isotopes (see Fig. 7). On the other hand, the model\nmass excess values diverge with the increasing neutron\nnumber for the Rb isotopes (see Fig. 8). The neutron capture Q-value of 91 Br indicates that this isotope might directly lie on the r-process path. A reduced shell gap energy\nis observed at Z = 35 compared to Z = 40. The theoretical shell gap values are in a poor agreement with the\nexperimental results.\nMore exotic Rb and Br isotopes will be measured in\nthe future to gain a comprehensive understanding of the\nshell effects at lower Z regions. To complete the shell\ngap plots towards the lower Z region for N0 = 50, future\nJYFLTRAP experiment will aim to measure the masses\nof the neutron-rich isotopes further down towards Z = 28.\n\nThis work has been supported by the TRAPSPEC Joint Research Activity project under the EU 6th Framework program\n\"Integrating Infrastructure Initiative - Transnational Access\",\nContract Number: 506065 (EURONS) and by the Academy of\nFinland under Finnish center of Excellence Program 2006-2011\n(Nuclear and Accelerator Based Physics Program at JYFL and\nproject number 202256 and 111428).\n\n\fS.
