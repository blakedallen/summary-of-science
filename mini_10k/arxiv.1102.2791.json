Besides the proposed combination of optimization schemes, supporting the technical details\nsuch as closed forms of cost function sensitivity matrices are provided. Finally, the validity of the proposed method\nis examined in several localization scenarios, taking into account the noise in the environment, the multi-path\nphenomenon and considering the sensors not being synchronized.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\ntime difference of arrival (TDOA); analyzing the signal direction of arrival (DOA) at distinct arrays;\nand using the differences in the signal amplitude or\nreceived energy level. For a constant propagation\nspeed, the TDOA among different sensors is proportional to the source-sensor range differences and may\nbe estimated through methods such as cross correlation (CC) [6] or its generalized version (GCC) [7].\nThe source locations can then be estimated using\ngeometric methods such as linear, spherical or hyperbolic intersections [8\u201310]. To estimate the DOA,\nfor narrowband signals, high resolution algorithms\nsuch as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) [11]\nand maximum likelihood (ML) [12] are proposed.\n\nA challenging and highly demanding signal processing application is the localization of signal sources\nusing the physical measurements at some sensors in\nthe environment. Source localization has become\nan important task in various applications such as\nmobile communications, global positioning system\n(GPS), radar, sonar, navigation, seismology and geophysics [1\u20135].\nDuring the recent decades various algorithms\nhave been proposed to estimate the location of the\nsignal sources. These methods utilize different signal characteristics at different sensors and generally\ncan be classified in three main categories: using the\n1\n\n\fIn [13], the authors propose an approximate maximum likelihood method (AML) for wideband signals\nusing spectral properties of the signal when rather\nlong sample streams are available. In this method,\nthe corresponding cost function can be directly expressed in terms of the source locations or in a far\nfield case may be expressed in terms of the relative\ntime delays followed by a post processing step to find\nthe source locations from the corresponding DOAs.\nThe post processing step may be carried out through\ngeometric methods such as cross bearing or a machine learning approach such as the support vector\nmachine (SVM) method [14]. Using the differences\nin the signal intensity or energy level for the purpose\nof localization is a more recent technique [15, 16].\nTheoretically, this class of localization can be considered for both narrowband and wideband signals\nby only taking into account the attenuation information and usually neglecting the time delay information. For these methods, a precise attenuation\nmodel in the environment is inevitable for an accurate localization. Moreover, from an optimization\nperspective the resulting cost functions in these kind\nof approaches usually undergo many local optima\nand saddle points which require considering specific\noptimization schemes [17].\nIn this paper, we tackle the problem of localization of multiple wideband sources by coherently\ntaking into account the TDOA and the amplitude attenuation pattern. Our method generalizes the AML\napproach to utilize the signal attenuation characteristics. We provide a more robust algorithm in which\nthe targets should simultaneously satisfy the correct\ntime delays among the sensors and provide sensible level of attenuation at each sensor. Unlike the\naforementioned energy and intensity based methods\nwhich not only ignore the time delay stamps but\nalso require knowing the signal attenuation model,\nwe benefit using the delay information and as a generalization to our recent work in [18], leave the space\nfor not knowing an exact signal attenuation model in\nthe environment by suggesting an appropriate functional space for it. We minimize a cost function\nwhich is obtained through maximum likelihood approach from which the locations, attenuation model\nparameters and the multi-path parameters are obtained. To apply the minimization we propose a hybrid approach combining the differential evolution\nalgorithm [19] with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [20]. This combination provides a minimization scheme which is likely to globally search for the\n\noptima and rather quickly converges to the accurate results. Through simulations and Cram\u00e9r-Rao\nbound we verify the effectiveness of the novel method\nintroduced in this paper.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section\n2, we propose a general form for the received signal at every sensor and later provide an adaptive\nmodel for the signal attenuation based on Laurent\npolynomials. In section 3, a maximum likelihood estimation of the source location and attenuation parameters is proposed. We also provide the Cram\u00e9rRao bound for this estimation problem. For the purpose of minimization in section 4 a hybrid approach\ncombining the differential evolution algorithm with\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt is proposed for which the\ncombination algorithm and closed form equations for\ncalculation of the Jacobian are provided. In section\n5, we examine the efficiency of proposed method\nthrough some examples and finally there are some\nconcluding remarks in section 6.\n\n2\n\nProblem Definition\n\n2.1 Signal Model\nAlthough the general approach proposed in this paper is in theory independent of signal nature and the\ntype of sensors used, in order to make reasonable\nsimulations we consider acoustic source localization.\nConsider N acoustic sources having unknown locations rSn . Each source is omni-directionally emitting a signal sn (t), n = 1, \u22ef, N at the time frame t.\nWe also consider M acoustic microphones that are\nplaced in known positions rMm , m = 1, \u22ef, M , in the\nsame environment. For every source in the environment, the function that describes the signal attenuation at a specific point is \u03b1(\u03c1), where \u03c1 is the\ndistance from the point to the source. In general,\nthe signal attenuation function may be a function of\nvarious parameters such as signal frequency, medium\ninhomogeneity, etc. To simplify the problem, in this\npaper we consider this function to be an identical\nform for all sources and solely function of the distance to the source. However, unlike some previous\nenergy based localizations (e.g., see [16,17]) in which\nthe attenuation is known to be proportional to \u03c1\u22121 ,\nthe actual form of \u03b1(\u22c5) is considered unknown function here. This type of modeling provides an additional flexibility to the problem for more realistic\nscenarios where the inverse proportionality of \u03b1(\u22c5) to\n\u03c1 is violated due to other parameters, such as signal\n2\n\n\fbandwidth and medium inhomogeneity. Considering\nsn (t \u2212 1 \u00d7 Ns /v) to be the signal measured 1 length\nunit away from every source with Ns being the samples per second and v being the propagation speed,\nideally the overall received signal samples from the\nacoustic sources at every microphone is modeled as\n\nin which the unknown parameters are separated in\nindividual terms, i.e.,\nN\n\nXm (f ) = \u2211 \u03b1(\u03c1m,n ) exp(\u2212\nn=1\n\nN Pm,n\n\n+ \u2211 \u2211 \u03b3m,n,p exp(\u2212\n\nN\n\nxm (t) = \u2211 \u03b1(\u03c1m,n )sn (t \u2212 \u03c4m,n ),\n\nn=1 p=1\n\n(1)\n\n(3)\n\nfor\n\nt = 0, 1, \u22ef, nt \u2212 1, m = 1, 2, \u22ef, M.\n\nf = 0, 1, \u22ef, nf \u2212 1, m = 1, 2, \u22ef, M.\n\nHere \u03c1m,n = \u2225rMm \u2212 rSn \u2225 is the distance from nth\nsource to mth microphone and \u03c4m,n = \u03c1m,n Ns /v is\nthe corresponding time samples delay in receiving\nthe signal. The received signal in (1) is normalized\nto each microphone gain level in order to decrease\nthe number of notations. A more realistic model\ntakes into account the noise in the environment and\nalso the signals going through a multi-path channel\nbefore arriving at every sensor, hence we rewrite the\nreceived signal as\n\nHere, Xm (f ), Sn (f ) and \u03bem (f ) are the data, signal\nand noise spectrums respectively. As stated in [13],\nwe emphasize on the fact that for (3) to be a valid\nequivalent form of (2), we need nt to be large enough\nto avoid edge effects and accordingly nf > nt . In\ngeneral having more samples from the signal better\nposes the problem.\n\n2.2\n\nA Low Order Representation of Signal Attenuation Model\nAs discussed earlier, our assumption about the attenuation model in the environment in this paper is\nan identical model for all sources, which is only dependent on the distance of the point to the acoustic\nsource. In an ideal environment, \u03b1(\u03c1) can be well\nmodeled as a multiple of \u03c1\u22121 . Since there are different parameters involved in the attenuation modeling, \u03b1(\u03c1) is being considered as an unknown here.\nHowever, in order to keep the well-posedness of the\nproblem, we choose it to be an element of a low dimensional function space. For this sake, we consider\n\u03b1(\u03c1) to be a Laurent polynomial of limited order as\n\nN\n\nxm (t) = \u2211 \u03b1(\u03c1m,n )sn (t \u2212 \u03c4m,n )\nn=1\n\nN Pm,n\n\n+ \u2211 \u2211 \u03b3m,n,p sn (t \u2212 \u03c4\u0302m,n,p )\nn=1 p=1\n\n+ wm (t).\n\nj2\u03c0\nf \u03c4\u0302m,n,p )Sn (f )\nnf\n\n+ \u03bem (f )\n\nn=1\n\nfor\n\nj2\u03c0\nf \u03c4m,n )Sn (f )\nnf\n\n(2)\n\nThe term wm (t) represents the background noise\nwhich is considered to be a zero-mean white Gaussian with variance \u03c3 2 for the sake of this paper;\ni.e., Gaussianity is not a limiting assumption in this\npaper. Between the nth source and mth microphone we consider Pm,n indirect paths each causing\n\u03b3m,n,p loss in the signal amplitude and \u03c4\u0302m,n,p delay in the signal reception, modeling the multi-path\nphenomenon. Beside the positions rSn , which are\nthe main unknowns of the localization problem, the\nsignals sn (t), the multi-path parameters \u03b3m,n,p and\n\u03c4\u0302m,n,p , and the propagation loss function \u03b1(\u22c5) are\nalso unknown and should be determined based on\nthe received signals at the sensors. The appearance\nof \u03c4m,n (which is related to the unknown quantities rSn ) and \u03c4\u0302m,n,p as the argument of an unknown\nsignal sn (t) causes an extra complexity for any optimization scheme performed to solve the localization\nproblem.

As\nan alternative to this and specifically for a least\nsquares cost function as (11), local search methods\nsuch as gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods\nmay be considered [20]. Although these methods\ncan be relatively faster than the global ones, there\nis always a chance of getting trapped into a local\nminima. In the context of localization, although for\ngood initial estimates of the source relatively fast\nmethods such as the gradient descent and alternating projection are proposed, to increase the chances\nof finding a global minima the process usually involves exhaustive search methods such as the grid\nsearch and multiresolution search [13, 16].\nFor the purpose of this paper we consider a hybrid approach combining a global search method\nwith a fast local search method [25, 26]. Hybrid\nmethods have received considerable interests in different areas in the recent years [26\u201329]. More specifically we consider a hybrid combination of the Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) [19] as successful\nevolutionary search with the Levenberg-Marquardt\nalgorithm (LMA) [20,30] as a rather fast and robust\nlocal search method. Before getting to the combination scheme, we provide a brief description of each\nmethod highlighting the main technical issues specifically in the context of our localization problem.\n\nscalar controlling the difference vector amplification.\n\n4.1.2 Crossover\nA mixing with the mutant vector to increase the diversity of the population is performed by generating\nnew trial vectors \u03c5 i,G of length D, defined as\nr(d)[0,1] \u2264 CR or d = k(i)\notherwise,\n(30)\nwith d = 1, 2, \u22ef, D. Here CR \u2208 [0, 1] is the crossover\nconstant, r(d)[0,1] is the dth evaluation of a uniform random number generator in [0, 1] and k(i) \u2208\n{1, 2, \u22ef, D} is a randomly chosen index ensuring that\n\u03c5 i,G takes at least one of the elements of \u03bci,G .\n\u03c5d,i,G = {\n\n4.1.3 Selection\nAt this step a next generation population member\n\u03b8 i,G+1 is produced by a selection among \u03b8 i,G and\n\u03c5 i,G . This selection is based on the fitness, and basically, the vector with the lower cost proceeds to the\nnext generation.\n\n4.2\n\nA Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm for the\nlocal Minimization\nAs the local minimization scheme, we suggest using\nthe LMA. Our attention towards this algorithm is\nbased on several advantages. LMA is basically considered as a Newton type method and provides a\nrather quadratic convergence. Meanwhile this algorithm benefits from stability and uses a trust region\napproach [30]. The other feature of this method,\nconsidered as an advantage over other methods such\nas the gradient descent, is its suitability for cases\nwhere there are different variables of different types\nas the cost function arguments. In fact LMA is almost independent of variable scaling, while for methods such as the gradient descent, minimizing a cost\nfunction dependent on a set of variables with different natures and scales requires appropriate parameter scaling to guarantee a proper convergence [30].\nThis is a demanding feature for our problem where\nthe \u03b8 vector in general consists of the source locations, attenuations coefficients and the multi-path\nparameters.\nIn the LMA which is an iterative algorithm, we\nstart with a \u03b8 (0) as the starting point. At every iteration, having \u03b8 (i) already in hand, \u03b8 (i+1) can be\n\n4.1 Differential Evolution Algorithm\nDE is among the metaheuristic and evolutionary\nglobal optimization schemes. Simplicity and successful performance are the main advantages of this\nalgorithm. Considering \u03b8 = [\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u22ef, \u03b8D ] to be the\nvector of problem unknowns with size D, at every\ngeneration G of the algorithm NP parameter vectors \u03b8 i,G = [\u03b81,i,G , \u03b82,i,G , \u22ef, \u03b8D,i,G ], i = 1, 2, \u22ef, NP ,\nare generated. The initial population is randomly\nchosen with a uniform distribution in the search region. For this work we consider the DE/rand/1/bin,\nwhich is a general and widely used strategy of this\nalgorithm [19, 31]. For every generation three main\noperations are performed as follows.\n\n4.1.1 Mutation\nIn this phase a mutant vector \u03bci,G is generated as\n\u03bci,G = \u03b8 r1 ,G + F (\u03b8 r2 ,G \u2212 \u03b8 r3 ,G ),\n\n\u03bcd,i,G ,\n\u03b8d,i,G ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere r1 , r2 and r3 are randomly selected indices\namong 1, 2, \u22ef, NP and F \u2208 [0, 2] is a constant real\n6\n\n\fobtained by solving\n(J\u03b8 T J\u03b8 + \u03bb(i) I)(\u03b8 (i+1) \u2212 \u03b8 (i) ) = \u2212J\u03b8 T Q,\n\nwhich somehow normalizes \u03b1(\u22c5) and unifies the representation. Clearly, since the desired unknowns of\nthe problem are the acoustic source coordinates, obtaining a multiple of the attenuation and multi-path\ncoefficients is non-problematic. The true attenuation model to be used in this paper is \u03b1(\u03c1) = \u03c1\u22121.25\n(see [15]).\n\n(31)\n\nwhere Q is the vertical vector of length M nf /2\nshown in (12) and obtained for values \u03b8 (i) at that\niteration. The parameter \u03bb(i) is the damping factor, obtained at every iteration based on the trust\nregion approach [20, 30]. The Jacobian matrix J\u03b8\ncontains the sensitivities of Q to every element of \u03b8.\nIn order to run the algorithm we need to know the\nJacobian matrix at every iteration, obtaining which\nis discussed in the Appendix.\n\n5.1 Example 1\nFor the purpose of this example, we consider the sensors to be placed in the first quarter of the x-y plane\nas a spiral array of M = 40 microphones. The spiral\nis represented in a parametric form as\n[\n\n4.3 The Hybrid Combination Scheme\nFor the purpose of combining the DE with the LMA,\nwe propose using a sequential hybridization approach\n[26]. In this approach, the DE initially starts the\nminimization by generating consecutively more fitting generations. After a certain number of generations or after getting relatively slow in decreasing\nthe fitness, the best \u03b8 in the last generation is passed\nto the LMA algorithm as an initialization. The minimization continues until convergence. An illustration of this algorithm is provided in Fig. 1.\n\n5\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the angles s are equally spaced in [2\u03c0, 4\u03c0].\nOur purpose of choosing such sensor arrangement\nwas to provide a non-symmetric and still reproducible arrangement. The sensor locations are\nshown in Fig. 2. The sources used in this example are wideband sources with center frequency 500\nHz and 200 Hz bandwidth. The sampling frequency\nis 4 KHz. The number of samples available from\nthe sources at every sensor is nt = 4000 (i.e., the\nsignal duration is 1 second) and the number of frequency bins is taken to be nf = 4100. The signal to\nnoise ratio (SNR) at every sensor is 20 dB and the\nspeed of propagation is considered to be the speed of\nsound as v = 345 m/s. In the proposed minimization\nscheme and more specifically the DE part, we take\nGmax = 5. Moreover, we set F = 0.8, CR = 1 and\nNP = 40. This parameter setting was selected as a\ngeneral DE setting, however more discussions on determining the DE parameters are available in [19].\nThe general attenuation model is considered to be\n\u03b1(\u03c1) = \u03c1\u22121 + \u03b21 \u03c1\u22122 + \u03b22 \u03c1\u22123 , for which the values \u03b21\nand \u03b22 are in charge of tuning the unknown model.\nThere is no reverberation in the environment (i.e.,\nK\u0303 = K) and all sensors are synchronized in receiving the signal.\nTo provide a better understanding of the problem, in Fig. 2 the cost function behavior for a known\nattenuation model is shown. In Fig. 2.a the cost\nis shown when the source is located at point (4, 3)\nwithin the sensors convex hull. All positions are in\nmeters. Fig. 2.b shows the cost when the source\nis located at (12, 10) outside the sensors region. In\nboth cases the cost functions are rather well behaved\nfunctions away from the sensors. Intuitively, for two\n\nSimulation Results\n\nTo examine the method developed in the previous section, we consider some localization examples\nin this section. In the first example we consider\na reverberation-free environment to show the efficiency of the method for such cases and provide a\ncomparative study for this scenario. The second example brings more realistic issues such as the multipath, and sensor synchronization error into the problem and examines the performance of the proposed\nmethod for such cases.\nBefore proceeding with the examples we would\nlike to highlight a fact regarding the relationship between the cost function and the matrix K\u0303. Referring\nto (15), it can be easily verified that scaling K\u0303(f )\nby a scalar does not change the cost function. In\nother words if the \u03b2` and \u03b3m,n,p values are simultaneously scaled by a scalar value, the cost function\nremains the same. Therefore, we rewrite the attenuation model in (4) as\nL\n\n\u03b1(\u03c1) = \u03c1\u22121 + \u2211 \u03b2` \u03c1\u2212`\u22121 ,\n\n4 + \u03c0s cos s\nxMm\n],\n]=[\n4 + \u03c0s sin s\nyMm\n\n(32)\n\n`=1\n\n7\n\n\fGenerate an Initial Population\n\nG=0\n\nCreate and Test a New DE\nGeneration\n\nG=G+1\n\nNo\n\nG = Gmax ?\nYes\nApply the LMA\n\nEnd\n\nFigure 1: A sequential hybridization combing the DE with the LMA\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: (a) The cost function corresponding to a source located at (4, 3) assuming a known attenuation\nmodel. (b) The cost function corresponding to a source located at (12, 10).\n\n8\n\n\fneighboring points in the domain, sudden variation\nof the cost function with respect to both time delay\ncriteria and attenuation model constraints is unlikely\nand hence the resulting cost functions are usually expected to be rather slow varying and well behaved\naway from the sensors.\nIn Fig. 3 we have shown the iterative procedure\nof finding a single source, once located at (4, 3) and\nonce at (12, 10). For the first case the source location\nis estimated to be at (4.002, 3.008) and the attenuation coefficients are estimated to be \u03b21 = \u221223.85 and\n\u03b22 = 27.93. In the second case the source estimation\nis (11.999, 10.002) and the attenuation coefficients\nare found to be \u03b21 = 4.19 and \u03b22 = 1.79. We observe\nthat both localization results accurately match the\nexact source positions. The attenuation coefficients\nobtained in both cases are only in charge of fitting\nthe low order model to the true model for the sourcesensor ranges in each problem and due to different\nproblems they do not necessarily need to be in the\nsame ranges. By providing this low order attenuation model we provide the flexibility to the problem\nfor accurately estimating the sources.\nAs a more challenging problem, we consider concurrent localization of the two sources located at\n(4, 3) and (12, 10). Fig. 4 shows the iterative procedure of finding the sources. The estimated source locations are (4.000, 3.001) and (11.989, 9.993) and the\nattenuation parameters are estimated to be \u03b21 = 4.77\nand \u03b22 = \u22123.94. Again an accurate match between\nthe exact source locations and the estimated ones is\nobservable.\nWe further examine our proposed method\nthrough a comparison with the AML method developed in [13]. For this purpose we start reducing the\nsignal samples by reducing the signal duration from\n1 to 0.1 seconds and observing the error caused in\nthe source estimation. Here we consider the single\nsource localization for the source being located at\n(12, 10). Fig. 5 shows the resulting error as the\nsignal duration decreases in both methods. As it is\nclearly observed, using both time delay and attenuation information helps our method provide better estimates of the source locations even with less\navailable data compared to the AML method which\nonly uses the time delay information. We further\nexamine the performance of both methods for various SNR values. In Fig. 6 the CRLB is calculated\nfor the same single source scenario with the source\nlocated at (12, 10). The RMS errors in estimating\nthe x and y components of the source are obtained\n\nthrough 50 independent noise realizations for every\nSNR value shown in the figure. Again the proposed\nmethod shows an acceptable performance regarding\nthe closeness to the CRLB and the superior performance compared to the AML method.\n\n5.2 Example 2\nIn a more realistic scenario, we examine the performance of the proposed method in a noisy environment where sensor synchronization error and reverberation are likely to happen. The sensor network\nconfiguration is shown in Figure 7, where three circular arrays each composed of 25 sensors centered at\npoints (15,5), (2,15) and (5,28) are considered. The\nacoustic source is located at (35,25) and the signal\nspecifications are the same as the previous example.\nFor this example Gmax is taken to be 20 to benefit\nmore from a global search of a cost function which\nmay not be as well-behaved as the previous example\ndue to bringing more unknown parameters into the\nproblem. The low order attenuation model considered in this example is \u03b1(\u03c1) = \u03c1\u22121 + \u03b2\u03c1\u22122 with \u03b2 as\nthe tuning parameter. Again an SNR of 20 dB is\nconsidered at all sensors for all the experiments.\nWe first examine the case that the sensors are\nnot exactly synchronized to receive the data. For\nthis purpose we rewrite the main component of the\nsignal in (1) as\nN\n\n\u2211 \u03b1(\u03c1m,n )sn (t \u2212 \u03c4m,n + \u03b6),\n\n(34)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a random variable uniformly distributed\naround zero. Equation (34) basically models the\nasynchronous measurements of the sensor data. In\nTable 1 we have provided the localization results for\nthree different synchronization error variances 0.5,\n1 and 2 milliseconds. Clearly the phase error is a\ndestructive phenomenon in TDOA localization algorithms, however, considering the localization errors\nin Table 1, one would observe that exploiting the attenuation information beside the phase information\nenables our algorithm to perform a rather accurate\nlocalization task in case of sensors being out of synchronism.\nFurthermore, a more challenging problem is\nwhen the reverberation is also taken into account. In\ntheory, for the emitted signal to arrive at every measuring sensor, an individual multi-path filter should\nbe considered. Although the formulation in this paper is general, for the purpose of this example we\n9\n\n\f12\n\n8\n\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\n4.2\n11.5\n\n6\n\n4\n11\n\n10.5\n\ny\n\n3.6\n\nSource\n\n10\n\n9.5\n\n3.4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n9\n3.2\n\u22124\n\n8.5\n\nSource\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\nx\n\n6\n\n8\n9.5\n\n6.5\n\n10\n\n10.5\n\n(a)\n\n11\n\n11.5\n\n12\n\nx\n\n12.5\n\n13\n\n13.5\n\n14\n\n\u22126\n\n14.5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\niteration\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3: (a) The progressive estimates of a single source located at (4, 3).

The fifth row of Table 1 corresponds\nto the case of having both the multi-path and the\nsynchronization issues, for which the results are still\npromising. The progressive estimates of the target\nthroughout the minimization are shown in Figure 9.\n\nhave made a reasonable and practical assumption\nthat for all the sensors within each array, the filter\nrepresenting the multi-path is identical. In general\nthe sensor network may be represented as a collection several clusters each composed of sensors closely\nplaced and each cluster treated as a single receiving\nnode. This assumption prevents dealing with a large\ncollection of unknowns (\u03b3m,n,p and \u03c4\u0302m,n,p ) for every\nsource-sensor pair and aggregates them into fewer\nparameters each assigned to the clusters.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed an efficient method for\nlocalization of multiple wideband sources based on\nboth signal attenuation and time delay information.\nThe method developed in this paper models the localization problem as a minimization problem and\nprovides an additional flexibility of not being exactly\naware of the signal attenuation model. We propose\na certain function space for the unknown model, and\ntune it iteratively along to estimate the signal source\nlocations. The minimization scheme used here is a\nhybrid algorithm, combining the differential evolution with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This\ncombination increases the chances of finding a global\nminima while benefits from the speed and computational advantages of Newton methods. The accuracy\nand performance of the method is examined through\nseveral simulations depicting a noisy environment, a\nmulti-path environment and lack of synchronization\namong sensors. In the simulations, we compared our\napproach with the approximate maximum likelihood\n\nTo generate a reverberated signal we use the\nmulti-path FIR filters shown in Figure 8 where three\nor four shifted scales of the signal are added to it.\nFor the localization purpose, however, we only consider finding the main indirect path. In other words,\nfor every array shown in Figure 7 only one multipath coefficient \u03b3 and one multi-path delay \u03c4\u0302 is to\nbe estimated which totally brings 6 unknowns associated with the multi-path phenomenon into the\nminimization problem. The remaining minimization\nunknowns are the source coordinates and the attenuation coefficients as before. The fourth row of Table 1 shows the localization result for this problem.\nAlthough the number of unknowns were relatively\nhigher than the previous examples and the cost function is clearly not as well-behaved as before, using\nDE as the initial minimization scheme provides a\nsuitable starting state for the LMA and this sequential technique helps the algorithm make a rather ac12\n\n\f0\n\n10\n\nArray 1\n\n0.5\n\u22121\n\n0.15\n\n10\n\n0.03\n\n0.01\n\n\u22122\n\nNormalized Multipath Coefficients\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\n10\n\nArray 2\n0.3\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0.1\n0.025\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\nArray 3\n0.4\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n10\n12\nMultipath Delays (mS)\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFigure 8: The multi-path impulse response associated with each array.
