The BABAR and Belle experiments have studied B-meson decays to \u03c0\u03c0, \u03c1\u03c0 and \u03c1\u03c1\nfinal states. It is possible to combine these measurements to constrain \u03b1 with a precision\nof O(10\u25e6 ) and a central value of approximately 100 degrees. These results are consistent\nwith Standard Model expectations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a summary of the experimental constraint on \u03b1 obtained by the B-factories from B\nmeson decays involving b \u2192 u transitions. The final states of interest for these studies are\nB \u2192 hh, where h = \u03c1, \u03c0. CP Violation (CPV) in the Standard Model of particle physics\n(SM) is described by a single complex phase. Interference between direct decay and decay after\nB 0 -B 0 mixing results in a time-dependent decay-rate asymmetry between B 0 and B 0 decaying\nto h+ h\u2212 that is sensitive to the CKM [1] angle \u03b1 \u2261 arg [\u2212Vtd Vtb\u2217 /Vud Vub\u2217 ]. The presence of\nloop (penguin) contributions introduces additional phases that can shift the experimentally\nmeasurable parameter \u03b1eff away from the value of \u03b1. In the presence of penguin contributions\n\u03b1eff = \u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b1penguin . The CKM angle \u03b2 is well known and consistent with SM predictions.\nAny constraint on \u03b1 constitutes a new test of the SM description of quark mixing and CPV in\nB-meson decays. Any significant deviation from SM expectation would be a clear indication of\nnew physics. The SM prediction for \u03b1 are [95 \u00b1 9]\u25e6 from [2] and [98 \u00b1 16]\u25e6 [3].\nThere are two classes of measurement that the B-factories are pursuing, the main goal is to\nuse SU(2) relations to relate different hh final states and limit \u03b4\u03b1penguin in each of the modes\nB 0 (B 0 ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c0 \u2212 and B 0 (B 0 ) \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 . In some cases only weak constraints on\n\u03b1 are obtained when using SU(2) analysis and one must use a model dependent approach to\nobtain a significant result.\nExperimental results are quoted with statistical errors preceding systematic errors unless\notherwise stated.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIsospin analysis of B \u2192 hh\n\nOne can relate the amplitudes of B decays to \u03c0\u03c0 final states by noting that\nand\n\n+\u2212\n\u221a1 A\n2\n\n+0\n\n=A\n\n00\n\n\u2212A\n\n\u221a1 A+\u2212\n2\n\n= A+0 \u2212A00\n\n[4]. These two relations correspond to triangles in a complex plane.\n+0\n\nIn the absence of Electroweak penguin contributions, |A+0 | = |A |, i.e. the two triangles have\n+\u2212\na common base. The phase difference between A+\u2212 and A\nis related to |\u03b1ef f \u2212 \u03b1|. Thus,\nin order to measure \u03b1 one must measure the branching fractions (B ) and charge asymmetries\n(ACP ) of B decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The decays of B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 and B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 are more\ncomplicated. In the case of the former decays one has up to three isospin triangle analyses to\nperform to extract maximal information from data. The final state of B decays to \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 is not\na CP eigenstate, which results in the need either for a pentagon isospin analysis [5] or a Dalitz\nPlot (DP) analysis [6].\nFor initial measurements of \u03b1, one can safely neglect electroweak penguin contributions to\nthe isospin analysis as these are a small correction to \u03b1 [7]. Some estimates of the effect of\nSU(2) symmetry breaking exist [8], where any correction is estimated to be much less than 10\u25e6 .\n\n3\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nContinuum e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c) events are the dominant background. To discriminate\nsignal from continuum one uses either a neural network, Fisher discriminant or likelihood ratio of\nevent shape variables. Signal candidates (Brec ) are identified kinematically\nusing two variables,\n\u221a\nthe difference \u2206E between\nand s/2, and the beam-energy\nq the CM energy of the B candidate\n\u221a\n2\n2\n2\nsubstituted mass mES = (s/2 + pi * pB ) /Ei \u2212 pB , where s is the total CM energy. The B\nmomentum pB and four-momentum of the initial state (Ei , pi ) are defined in the laboratory\nframe. The signal is extracted using an extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit.\nTo study the time-dependent asymmetry one needs to measure the proper time difference,\n\u2206t, between the two B decays in the event, and to determine the flavor tag of the other Bmeson (Btag ). The time difference between the decays of the two neutral B mesons in the event\n(Brec , Btag ) is calculated from the measured separation \u2206z between the Brec and Btag decay\nvertices. The Brec vertex is determined from the two charged-pion tracks in its decay. The Btag\ndecay vertex is obtained by fitting the other tracks in the event.\nThe signal decay-rate distribution f+ (f\u2212 ) for Btag = B 0 (B 0 ) is given by:\nf\u00b1 (\u2206t) =\n\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4\n[1 \u00b1 S sin(\u2206md \u2206t) \u2213 C cos(\u2206md \u2206t)] ,\n4\u03c4\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the mean B 0 lifetime, \u2206md is the B 0 -B 0 mixing frequency. For B decays to \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 ,\nS= SL or ST and C= CL or CT are the CP asymmetry parameters for the longitudinal and\ntransversely polarized signal. The decay-rate distribution for B decays to the \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final state\nis described below. The fitting function takes into account mistag dilution and is convoluted\nwith the \u2206t resolution function.\nCPV is probed by studying the time-dependent decay-rate asymmetry A = (R(\u2206t) \u2212\nR(\u2206t))/(R(\u2206t) + R(\u2206t)), where R(R) is the decay-rate for B 0 (B 0 ) tagged events. This\n2\n\n\fasymmetry has the form A = S sin(\u2206md \u2206t) \u2212 C cos(\u2206md \u2206t)1 . In the case of charged B meson\ndecays (and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 as there is no vertex information) one can study a time integrated charge\nasymmetry, ACP = (N \u2212 N)/(N + N), where N (N) is the number of B (B) decays to the final\nstate. A non-zero measurement of S, C or ACP for any of the decays understudy would be a\nclear indication of CP violation.\n\nB \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\n4\n\nThe simplest decays to study in the pursuit of \u03b1 are B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0. Both experiments have measurements for B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays [9, 10].

This is the second observation of CPV in B-meson decays and is illustrated in Figure 1\n. The BABAR data do not support this conclusion, and the discrepancy between the two\nexperiments is more than 3\u03c3. One must wait for a significant increase in statistics from both\nexperiments to see if the results of the experiments become more compatible.\nThe \u03c0\u03c0 isospin analysis is limited by the value of B(B 0 (B 0 ) \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ).

The\nlongitudinal polarization fraction fL is defined as the fraction of the helicity zero state in the\ndecay. The angular distribution is\nd2 \u0393\n1\n9\nfL cos2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82 + (1 \u2212 fL ) sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82\n=\n\u0393d cos \u03b81 d cos \u03b82\n4\n4\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8i , i = 1, 2 is defined for each \u03c1 meson as the angle between the \u03c0 0 momentum in the\n\u03c1 rest frame and the flight direction of the B 0 in this frame. The angle between the \u03c1-decay\nplanes is integrated over to simplify the analysis. A full angular analysis of the decays is needed\nin order to separate the definite CP contributions; if however a single CP channel dominates\nthe decay (which has been experimentally verified), this is not necessary [12]. The longitudinal\npolarization dominates this decay [13, 14]. Not all of the \u03c1\u03c1 final states have been observed,\nhowever as B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 ) is small, one can conservatively assume that is longitudinally dominated when performing an isospin analysis. There are assumptions in addition to SU(2) that\nare made when performing a \u03c1\u03c1 isospin analysis. These are (i) neglect Electroweak penguin\ncontributions [a few \u25e6 effect] (ii) ignore possible I = 1 components in the decay [15]2 . The\nmeasured branching fractions, fL , S and C for B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 are summarised in Table 2.\nRecent measurements of the B + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c10 branching fraction and upper limit for B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10\n[16] indicate small penguin contributions in B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, as has been found in some calculations [17].\nThe decay mode B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c10 has only been studied using a small fraction of the available data\nof the B-factories. As has been remarked, it is important to see this mode updated in the near\nfuture [2, 3].\n2\n\nThis is a reasonable assumption given available statistics.\n\n4\n\n\fmode\n\u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212\n\nB\nfL\nS\nC\n30 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 4 0.99 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.04 \u22120.19 \u00b1 0.33 \u00b1 0.11 \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.24 \u00b1 0.14\nB\nfL\nACP\nmode Expt\n+5.7\n+0.05\n\u00b1 0\n\u03c1 \u03c1\nBABAR\n22.5\u22125.4 \u00b1 5.8\n0.\u22120.07 \u22120.19 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b1 0.03\n+0.05\nBelle\n31.7 \u00b1 7.1+3.8\n0.\n0.00 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.03\n\u03c1\u00b1 \u03c10\n\u22126.7\n\u22120.07\n0 0\nBABAR < 1.1 (90% C.L.)\n\u03c1\u03c1\n\nTable 2: Measurements of the B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays.

The \"penguin\" error is determined\nprimarily from the experimental knowledge of the \u03c10 \u03c10 and \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c10 branching ratios.

The more straight forward approach\nis to cut away interference regions of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 DP and analyse the regions in the vicinity\nof \u03c1 resonances. This is called the Quasi-2-body approach (Q2B) and it avoids the need to\n5\n\n\funderstand the interference regions. The drawback of the Q2B method is that one looses\nstatistical power by cutting on the DP. A corollory of this is that one requires more statistics\nthan the B-factories currently have in order to get a significant constraint from the pentagon\nisospin analysis. The alternative is to perform an analysis of the B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 DP, accounting\nfor the interference between intersecting \u03c1 resonance bands and other resonant structure. Both\nof these approaches have been studied by BABAR [18]. Belle has performed a Q2B analysis of\n\u03c1\u03c0 [19], and the first time-dependent DP analysis has been performed by BABAR [20].\nIn the Q2B approach, one fits a time-dependence of\nf\u00b1 (\u2206t) = (1 \u00b1 ACP )\n\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4\n[(S \u00b1 \u2206S sin(\u2206md \u2206t) \u2212 (C \u00b1 \u2206C) cos(\u2206md \u2206t)] ,\n4\u03c4\n\nwhere there are three additional parameters, a charged asymmetry, ACP , between decays to\n\u03c1+ \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c1\u2212 \u03c0 + final states, and two dilution parameters; \u2206S and \u2206C. The details of the DP\nanalysis can be found in [20], where one varies a larger number of parameters in the nominal\nfit, and converts these to the same observables as the Q2B approach. Table 3 summarises the\nexperimental constraints on B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 (DP analysis from BABAR and Q2B analysis from Belle).\nmode\nB \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00\nB 0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c0 \u2212\n\nExpt\nBABAR\nBelle\n\nS\n\u22120.10 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1 0.04\n\u22120.28 \u00b1 0.23+0.10\n\u22120.08\n\nC\nACP\n0.34 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.05 \u22120.088 \u00b1 0.049 \u00b1 0.013\n0.25 \u00b1 0.17+0.02\n\u22120.16 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22120.06\n\nTable 3: Measurements of the B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays. BRs are in units of 10\u22126 .\n\u25e6\nUsing SU(2) with BABAR's DP result, one obtains the following constraint; \u03b1 = (113+27\n\u221217 \u00b16)\n(Figure 3 shows the corresponding confidence level plot for \u03b1). This result is self consistent as\nthe strong phase differences and amplitudes are determined solely from the structure of the DP.\nThe unique aspect of this result is that there is only a single solution between 0 and 180\u25e6 , thus\na two fold ambiguity in the \u03c1\u03b7 plane. As a result this measurement is an important constraint\non alpha, ancillary to that of the BABAR B 0 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 analysis.\nIt is possible to derive a model dependent constraint on alpha from these data. As shown\nby Gronau and Zupan [21]. One can make several assumptions, including (i) the relative strong\nphase differences between tree level contributions for \u03c1+ \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c1\u2212 \u03c0 + being less than 90\u25e6 (ii)\nSU(3) being exact for penguin amplitudes (iii) neglecting Electroweak penguins (iv) neglecting\nannihilation and exchange diagrams to derive a constraint on \u03b1. SU(3) breaking effects are\nestimated in this model using CLEO, BABAR and Belle data. When doing this Belle obtain\n\u03b1 = (102 \u00b1 11expt \u00b1 15model )\u25e6 . Gronau and Zupan compute the corresponding result for the\nBABAR analysis as (93 \u00b1 4expt \u00b1 15model )\u25e6 . There are other models proposed in the literature,\nfor example [22].\n\n7\n\nComparison with the Standard Model\n\nThe indirect measurements of \u03b1 from the SM are 95 \u00b1 9\u25e6 [2] and 98 \u00b1 16\u25e6 [3] from the UT\nFit and CKM Fitter groups, respectively.

The precision of this result is dominated by B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, with an important\ncontribution from B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0, where the latter reduces this constraint from four-fold to a two-fold\nambiguity in the \u03c1\u03b7 plane. In the next few years \u03b1 should be known to O(2 \u2212 3\u25e6 ) and the\nB-factories will be able to cleanly test the closure of unitarity triangle with precision for the\nfirst time. A significant isospin analysis result from B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 is still some way off. Similarly,\nthe model dependent calculations of \u03b1 are in agreement with the SM.\n\n8\n\nSummary\n\nIn the past year the B-factories have made significant progress towards a precision measurement\nof the unitarity triangle angle \u03b1, only relying on SU(2) symmetry. The dominant constraint\ncomes from B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays [14], which has a four-fold ambiguity in the \u03c1\u03b7 plane. The BABAR\nanalysis of B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays represents the first time-dependent CP analysis. Inclusion\nof the interference regions of the DP enables one to measure strong phase differences between\namplitudes contributing to the final state; In turn this enables one to derive a self consistent\nconstraint of \u03b1 with a two fold ambiguity in the \u03c1\u03b7 plane. One can also employ models to\nfurther constrain \u03b1 as has been discussed herein.\n\n8.1\n\nBibliography\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author wishes to thank M. Bona, A. H\u00f6cker, M. Perini and J.
