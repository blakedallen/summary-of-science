In this study, we developed numerical simulations of lateral\ndiffusion and exchange of fluorophores in membranes with arbitrary bleach geometry and exchange of\nthe membrane localized fluorophore with the cytosol during Fluorescence Recovery after\nPhotobleaching (FRAP) experiments. The model simulations were used to design FRAP experiments\nwith varying bleach region sizes on plasma-membrane localized wild type GFP-Ras2 with a dual lipid\nanchor and mutant GFP-Ras2C318S with a single lipid anchor in live yeast cells to investigate\ndiffusional mobility and the presence of any exchange processes operating in the time scale of our\nexperiments.

The methods developed in this study\nare generally applicable for studying diffusion and exchange of membrane associated fluorophores using\nFRAP on commercial confocal laser scanning microscopes.\n\n2\n\n\fIntroduction\nFluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) has been widely used as a method to measure\nmobility of fluorophores in solutions and within live cells [1]. Understanding processes such as diffusion,\nexchange and binding, which determine the recovery of fluorescence during a FRAP experiment, is\ncritical for elucidating the complex nature of the interactions between membrane associated proteins in a\nlipid environment. Commercially available confocal laser scanning microscopes (CLSM) and software\npackages have made the capability to perform FRAP widely accessible. However, confocal FRAP data\nare more difficult to interpret in comparison to Gaussian spot photo-bleaching due to the complexity in\ntaking into account the laser scanning process [2]. In addition to lateral diffusion, chemical exchange\nprocesses can also contribute to the recovery of fluorescence in FRAP experiments when extrinsic\nmembrane proteins are being considered [2, 3].\nPrior work on interpretation of confocal FRAP data for estimating mobilities of fluorophores in\nsolutions and in cells was focused on numerical simulations for line FRAP or derivation of analytical\nsolutions for FRAP on 2-D ROI's [4-9]. FRAP in systems with diffusion and binding to immobile\nbinding sites has been analyzed by Sprague et al. [9], and later generalized by Dushek et al. [10] for\nbinding to mobile sites localized to a membrane. To our knowledge, there is no known simulation in the\nliterature for diffusion and exchange of membrane associated fluorophores with cytosol, which accounts\nfor confocal point spread function and recovery during the bleach frame. The effects of bleaching and\nscanning beam point spread functions are significant when the beam waist is comparable to the size of\nthe bleach region of interest, especially in a small region of plasma membrane analyzed in this study. In\nthe present study we developed computational models to study the mobility and exchange of membrane\nassociated proteins in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using FRAP. Specifically, we developed\ncomputational models describing lateral diffusion of fluorophores within the plasma membrane and\nexchange of fluorophores between plasma membrane and the cytosol to design our FRAP experiments\nand interpret our data on the fluorescence recovery of GFP-tagged yeast Ras2 GTPase (GFP-Ras2). Ras\nproteins are evolutionarily conserved, membrane-associated, GTP binding proteins involved in several\nsignal transduction pathways. Mutations in ras genes have been implicated in over 30% of all human\ncancers. Like its mammalian counterparts, yeast Ras2 protein is initially synthesized as a soluble\nprecursor that associates with the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane only after posttranslational\nlipidation of the C-terminus of the protein with farnesyl and palmitate [11-13]. Although the use of\nFRAP to study the movement of membrane associated proteins in mammalian cells is not novel [14], the\nuse of confocal FRAP to measure diffusion and membrane exchange phenomena on the spatial scale and\nspherical surfaces of yeast membranes presents unique challenges that we have addressed here.\nThe computational models for diffusion and exchange processes were tested against data from FRAP\nexperiments with different bleach ROI sizes. The ROI size analysis was designed to detect any exchange\nof GFP-Ras2 in addition to diffusion. Henis et al. [3] developed a similar technique using Gaussian spot\nphotobleaching by changing beam size to determine the presence of exchange processes in addition to\ndiffusion. The development of ROI size analysis using confocal FRAP and numerical simulations of\nlateral diffusion and membrane-to-cytosol exchange for data analysis opens up new opportunities for\nmembrane studies in the genetically tractable yeast system.\n\n3\n\n\fMethods\nMicrobiological techniques\nYeast and bacterial strains were propagated by standard methods [15]. YEPD (1% Yeast Extract, 2%\nBactopeptone and 2% glucose) and Synthetic Dextrose (SD) media supplemented with amino acids were\nprepared as described previously [16]. Bacterial transformations, DNA preparations, and plasmid\nconstructions were performed by standard methods [15]. Yeast transformations were performed by the\nLi+ ion method [17].\nYeast Strains and Plasmids\nThe yeast strains used in this study were isogenic to the parental strain BY4742 (Open Labs, Inc.) and\nhave the genotype MATa his3\u03941 leu2\u03940 lys2\u03940 ura3\u03940. Construction of B1510 (GFP-RAS2), B861\n(GFP-Ras2C318S) and B1456 (GFP-PMA1) have been described previously [18, 19]. All GFP-Ras2\nallele plasmids contain the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP S65G S72A) fused to the RAS2\nopen reading frame under the control of the MET25 promoter. GFP-PMA1 is driven by the GAL1,10\npromoter. In experiments utilizing FRAP, cells were grown in synthetic dextrose medium lacking\nleucine (for selection) and methionine (for maximum fusion protein expression). GFP-PMA1\nexpression was induced with galactose (2%) in synthetic medium lacking leucine.\nYeast cell and glass slide preparation\nGlass slides were prepared by coating wells with 5\u03bcg of Concanavalin A (Canavalia ensiformis,\nJackbean; US Biologicals, Inc.) in water. The treatment was allowed to dry for 15 minutes at room\ntemperature. Yeast strains harboring GFP-RAS2, GFP-Ras2C318S or GFP-PMA1 were grown in SD\nmedium with the appropriate supplements to an optical density (OD600) of between 0.8 and 1.2.\nApproximately 4x105 cells (20\u03bcl) were spotted onto the concanavalin A treated wells and allowed to\nadhere for 10 minutes in the dark. Non-adhering cells were removed with repeated washes of water (4x\n20\u03bcl). Mounting medium (YEPD+1% low-melting agarose (Top Vision LM GQ, Fermentas)) was\nmelted and cooled to room temperature. Approximately 200\u03bcl of mounting medium was placed onto\nthe slide. The cover slip was placed on top of the medium and the excess medium and air bubbles\nremoved by applying pressure to the cover slip. The mounting medium was allowed to solidify at room\ntemperature for 15 minutes.\n\nConfocal microscopy\nAcquisition of FRAP data\nFRAP experiments were performed with a LEICA TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope using a\n63x 1.2 numerical aperture (NA) apochromat water objective. The GFP tagged proteins were excited\nwith a 488 nm laser scanning at 1400 lines per second in bidirectional mode and the fluorescence\nemission between 500 nm and 550 nm was recorded. Images were acquired at approximately 133 ms per\nframe. FRAP was performed on the plasma membrane associated pool of GFP-Ras2 proteins by imaging\nthe cell surface with the laser beam incident perpendicular to the cell surface. The curvature of yeast\ncell determines the upper limit of the ROI to not exceed 2 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 \u03bcm, which will be referred to as the\nImaged Area (IA) in this manuscript. Square ROI's of 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm and 0.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcm were bleached\nduring FRAP experiments. The confocal microscope was operated in fly-mode, where the scanning\nbeam bleaches during the forward sweep with intensity modulation for bleaching in the ROI and records\nthe signal with scanning intensity during the fly-back. This process ensures a near-instantaneous\nrecording of the post-bleach intensity for every bleached line. We also performed FRAP on GFP-PMA1,\nan integral membrane protein with at least ten membrane spanning domains, as an internal control based\non a significantly lower mobility of integral membrane proteins when compared to lipid anchored\n4\n\n\fproteins such as Ras2 [20]. The FRAP data were normalized to account for fluorophore loss during\nscanning, which were then analyzed by numerically solving reaction-diffusion equations in time and two\nspatial dimensions.\n\nData Analysis and Computational modeling of FRAP\nFRAP data normalization and model assumptions\nThe mean fluorescence intensity in the bleach region of interest (ROI) was normalized with respect to\nthe initial fluorescence and to the imaged area fluorescence (IA) with background subtraction (BG) [14,\n21]:\nF (t ) = 100\n\n[ FROI (t ) \u2212 FBG (t )] [ FIA (0) \u2212 FBG (0)]\n[ FROI (0) \u2212 FBG (0)] [ FIA (t ) \u2212 FBG (t )]\n\n(1)\n\nThe normalization in Eq. 1 accounts for the fluorescence loss due to bleaching during imaging. Since the\nnormalized data account for fluorophore loss due to scanning, the computational models for bleaching\nand recovery do not include fluorophore loss due to scanning.\nWe tested two hypotheses expressed in two models against the data to determine the processes\ncontributing to fluorescence recovery during the FRAP experiments. Model 1 treats the GFP-Ras2 as a\nsingle species diffusing laterally in the membrane and Model 2 tests whether the FRAP data can be\nexplained by a single species that diffuses in the membrane and exchanges with the cytosol.\nModel 1: Diffusion in 2 dimensions\nConcentration changes in fluorescent GFP-Ras2 due to diffusion and bleaching by laser scanning are\nsimulated by the following equation taking into account the bleach ROI geometry, and the beam point\nspread function,\n\u2202\n(2)\nC ( x, y, t ) = D\u2207 2C ( x, y, t ) \u2212 \u03b1 K n ( x, y )C ( x, y, t ) , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 Tb ,\n\u2202t\nwhere C is the concentration of the fluorophore, D is the diffusivity, \u03b1 is the laser illumination\ndependent bleach rate constant and Kn(x, y) is the normalized bleaching light distribution and Tb is the\nduration of the bleaching frame. Eq. 2 assumes that the fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the\nconcentration of the fluorophore. This equation was solved numerically using a Crank-Nicholson\nscheme with periodic boundary conditions [22]. Details of the implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme are\ngiven in the Appendix along with computer code written in Matlab\u00ae (The MathWorks Inc., Natick MA).\nTo simulate bleaching, the bleaching light distribution K(x, y) is given by the convolution of the ROI\nshape function B(x, y) and the bleaching beam intensity Ib(x, y).\nK ( x, y ) = B ( x , y ) \u2297 I b ( x , y )\nThe normalized bleaching light distribution is defined as:\nK ( x, y )\nK n ( x, y ) =\nK (0, 0)\nFollowing Braeckmans et al.[6], we define the ROI shape function as:\n\n5\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\fB( x, y ) = 1, \u2212l / 2 \u2264 x, y \u2264 1/ 2\nB( x, y ) = 0, l / 2 < x , y\n\n(5)\n\nThe interline distance in our experiments (0.016 \u03bcm) is much smaller than the 1/e2 radius w0 (0.248 \u03bcm)\nof the bleaching beam, which allows for treating the bleaching light distribution as the convolution of\nthe square bleach region B(x, y) with the bleaching beam intensity Ib(x, y). If the interline distance is\nmuch larger than w0, bleaching process should be simulated line-by-line [6].\nIb is the intensity of the laser beam during bleaching.\n\u23a1 \u239b x2 + y 2 \u239e\u23a4\n(6)\nI b ( x, y ) = I 0,b exp \u23a2 \u22122 \u239c\n\u239f\u23a5 ,\n2\n\u23a3 \u239d w0 \u23a0 \u23a6\nwhere I0,b is the intensity at (0, 0) and w0 is the 1/e2 radius of the bleaching beam. w0 is approximated as\n0.61\u03bbex/NA, where excitation wavelength \u03bbex = 488 nm and the numerical aperture NA = 1.2 [23].\nDuring numerical computations, Ib(x,y), was generated for a square grid that was 3w0 x 3w0 in size and\ncentered at (0, 0). The 1/e2 radius of the confocal imaging point spread function ws,0 is related to w0 and\nthe excitation and emission wavelengths for an infinitesimally small pinhole by the following equation\n[23]:\nws ,0 =\n\nw0\n1 + ( \u03bbex / \u03bbem )\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bbem is the emission wavelength of the fluorophore.\nThe data were normalized to account for fluorophore loss due to scanning during the post-bleach\nrecovery phase. Therefore, the post-bleach recovery curves were analyzed by the following 2-D\ndiffusion equation without any bleaching term.\n\u2202\nC ( x, y, t ) = D\u2207 2C ( x, y, t ) , t > Tb .\n\u2202t\n\n(8)\n\nC(x, y, t) obtained by solving Eqs. (2) and (8), was translated into the simulated fluorescence signal by\nperforming the same normalization used for the fluorescence data in Eq. 1:\nFsimulated (t ) =\n\nCROI ( x, y, t ) CIA ( x, y, 0)\n,\nCROI ( x, y, 0) CIA ( x, y, t )\n\n(9)\n\nwhere CROI ( x, y, t ) is computed as the product of C ( x, y , t ) and the normalized convolution of the\nbleach shape function B(x,y) and a 2-D Gaussian imaging point spread function whose 1/e2 radius was\ndefined in Eq. 7. Brackets i indicate averaging over the membrane area.\nDiffusivity D and the bleaching rate constant \u03b1 were estimated for GFP-Ras2 by fitting the Fsimulated(t) to\naveraged data from 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm bleach ROI and 0.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcm bleach ROI experimental data. The\nparameter estimation was performed using the fminsearch function in Matlab R2009a using a weighted\nresidual sum of squares (WRSS) as the cost function. Parameter precisions expressed as percent\ncoefficients of variation (CV) were estimated by computing an approximate variance-covariance matrix\nas detailed in Appendix C. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Criterion (SC) were\n6\n\n\fcalculated for determining model parsimony. The estimated parameters and their percent CV are\nreported in Table 1 and the parsimony criteria in Table 2.\nModel 2: Diffusion in 2 dimensions with exchange between the 2-dimensional membrane and a well\nmixed volume representing the cytosol\nTo test the hypothesis that GFP-Ras2 diffuses in the membrane and exchanges with the cytosol where it\ndiffuses faster, we solved a diffusion-exchange model described here. Our model is based on mass\nbalance of total fluorophore given by the following equation:\n\nCcVc + Cm Am = M ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Cc is the concentration of the fluorophore in the cytosol, which is assumed spatially homogenous;\nCm is the concentration of the fluorophore in the membrane; Vc is the volume of cytosol; Am is the area\nof the plasma membrane; and M is the number of moles of the fluorophore.\nThe insertion and removal of GFP-Ras2 are modeled as first order reaction:\n\u2202Cm\n= Dm\u2207 2Cm \u2212 koff Cm + kon Cc .\n\u2202t\n\n(11)\n\nSubstituting Eq. 10 into Eq. 11:\n\n\u239bM A\n\u239e\n\u2202Cm\n= Dm \u2207 2 Cm \u2212 koff Cm + kon \u239c \u2212 m Cm \u239f , t > Tb .\n\u2202t\n\u239d Vc Vc\n\u23a0\n\n(12)\n\nDiffusion, bleaching and exchange are accounted for during the bleach phase:\n\n\u239bM A\n\u239e\n\u2202\nC ( x, y, t ) = D\u2207 2 C ( x, y, t ) \u2212 koff Cm + kon \u239c \u2212 m Cm \u239f \u2212 \u03b1 K n ( x, y )C ( x, y, t ) , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 Tb ,\n\u2202t\n\u239d Vc Vc\n\u23a0\n\n(13)\n\nEqs. 12 and 13 are solved numerically by solving the diffusion process using the Crank-Nicholson\nscheme developed for Model 1 and the exchange process sequentially during each time step by means of\noperator splitting. These methods are detailed in Appendices A and B. For the purpose of simulating\ndiffusion and exchange processes, the volume of an average yeast cell is approximated by that of a\nsphere of 5 micron diameter and the area of the square membrane domain was set equal to the surface\narea of this sphere. From preliminary Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (data not shown)\nmeasurements of particle density per micron squared, we calculated the concentration of the fluorophore\non the membrane to be 0.01 nmol/dm2 or 10 pmol/dm2. In addition, we assumed that the ratio of number\nof fluorophores in the membrane to that in the cytosol was 1000:1, resulting in a nanomolar cytosolic\nconcentration of the fluorophore. The relationship between number of fluorophores in the cytosol and\nthe membrane leads to an equilibrium relationship between kon and koff:\nkon Cm\nV\n=\n= 1000 c = 8.33 \u00d7 10\u22123 dm .\nkoff\nCc\nAm\n\n(14)\n\nEq. 14 provides a constraint so only one rate constant may be treated as an adjustable parameter. We\ntreat koff as an adjustable parameter during parameter estimation and model simulations. The volume of\n7\n\n\fdistribution of cytosolic proteins will be the water space of cytosol excluding the spaces occupied by\nother organelles. Treating the entire intracellular space as the volume of distribution for the cytosolic\nRas2 may result in an underestimation of cytosolic concentration of the fluorophore. Only a detailed\nstudy using data from morphometry and cell composition can address this question [24], which is\nbeyond the scope of the present study. Changes in volume estimates will be reflected in the rate\nconstants and concentration estimates, which will be lumped in the parameter estimates for the rate\nconstants in the present study.\nFRAP simulations for both diffusion and exchange are performed by computing diffusion and exchange\nsolutions sequentially for each time step. Statistical analyses were performed on parameter estimates\nwere performed using methods detailed in Appendix C.\n\nResults and Discussion\nSubcellular localization and photobleaching of GFP-RAS proteins in yeast\nThe sub-cellular localization of GFP-Ras2 (double lipidated) and GFP-Ras2C318S (single lipidated)\nwas examined in wild type yeast cells. As previously observed, GFP-Ras2 is primarily localized on the\ninner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the sub-cellular localization of singly\nlipidated Ras2 is distributed between endomembranes and the plasma membrane, with the majority of\nthe protein on endomembranes (70%) (Fig. 1B). However, the pool of GFP-Ras2C318S on the plasma\nmembrane is sufficient for the FRAP analysis. Fig. 2 shows an example of a cell in which a 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1\n\u03bcm ROI has been photobleached and the recovery of fluorescence measured. Images are collected at\n~133 ms/frame and continuing for 20 seconds until complete recovery was observed. The normalized\nFRAP data showed complete recovery for all strains imaged. Therefore we did not include an immobile\nfraction in modeling the data, which would have shown up as a non recoverable fraction in the data.\nWhile collecting FRAP data from cells expressing GFP-Ras2-C318S, we note that any protein present in\nmembranous structures within the ROI under the plasma membrane could be bleached. However, the\nexperiment design is still capable of answering the question whether the recovery of fluorescence is\naided by plasma membrane localized fluorophores in the region surrounding the bleached ROI that\nexchange with cytosol where they may diffuse faster and exchange with the plasma membrane in the\nbleached ROI.\n\nAnalysis of diffusion of wild-type and non-palmitoylated GFP-Ras2 by FRAP\nFluorescence recovery data were collected from cells expressing GFP-Ras2 and GFP-Ras2C318S (nonpalmitoylated) at 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm and 0.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcm bleach ROI sizes. The normalized fluorescence\nrecovery data for GFP-Ras2 were analyzed by the two models described in the Methods section. Model\n1 accounts for single-species diffusion in the cell membrane, while model 2 accounts for both diffusion\nand exchange of protein between the membrane and the cytosol.\nFig. 3A shows FRAP recovery data and model fits for both ROI sizes for GFP-Ras2. The FRAP data for\nthe smaller bleach ROI size shows a faster recovery when compared to the larger ROI data, which would\nbe expected for a diffusion coupled phenomenon i.e., the recovery is not entirely governed by exchange\nwith cytosol. Note that the depth of photobleaching for the smaller ROI turned out to be greater than that\nof the larger ROI. Model predictions of FRAP recovery for a given diffusivity and bleach rate constant\nshows that the depth of photobleaching of the smaller ROI cannot be greater than that of the larger ROI\n(Fig 4A). Parameters of Model 1 and Model 2 for GFP-Ras2 were estimated both with and without the\ndata for the bleach frame and the immediate postbleach frame. Estimated parameters listed in Tables 1\n8\n\n\fand 2 show that the parameter estimates (D and \u03b1) for Model 1 for the larger ROI vary very little with\ninclusion or exclusion of bleach frame during fitting. Parameter estimates for the smaller ROI show that\nthe inclusion of the bleach frame during fitting results in higher estimates of D and \u03b1, but exclusion of\nthe bleach frame during fitting brings these estimates very close to and statistically not different from the\nlarger ROI at 95% significance level. In addition, the residuals from the fits that excluded the bleach\nframe and the immediate postbleach frame showed an autocorrelation that could be expected from a\nrandom signal at 95% significance level whereas the residuals from the fit that included all frames\nshowed a more structured correlation indicating a slightly poorer fit. (Differences between these fits re\nnot apparent to the naked eye when plotted on the axes scale of Figure 3.) Mueller et al.[25] found that\ndetector blinding or possible transient loss in postbleach detector sensitivity following saturating laser\nintensity detection in the bleach frame could result in erroneous detection of fluorescence in the\nimmediate post bleach frames and consequently very high estimates of diffusivity for large bleach ROI's.\nSince the depth of photobleaching discrepancy was found in the smaller ROI data for GFP-Ras2, and not\nfound in all datasets as demonstrated by parameter estimation results with and without bleach frame data,\nwe may not attribute it to detector blinding.\nParameter estimates for Model 2 show that the additional parameter koff is essentially indistinguishable\nfrom zero for all cases considered and the Akaike and Schwarz criteria, listed in Table 2, show that\nModel 1 is preferable to Model 2. The weighted residual sum of squares for Model 2 fit of 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm\nROI data show marginal improvement. However, AIC, SC and the P-Value of F-test show that Model 1\nis preferable to Model 2. In summary, we may conclude that the motion of GFP-Ras2 in the time scale\nof our experiments is well described by diffusion and that mean diffusivity estimate for GFP-Ras2 is\n~0.07 \u03bcm2/s.\nFig. 3B shows FRAP recovery data and model fits for both ROI sizes for GFP-Ras2C318S, which is not\npalmitoylated. The FRAP recovery data for the smaller bleach ROI size recovers faster and has a smaller\ndepth of photobleaching when compared to the recovery data from the larger bleach ROI size, which is\nconsistent with a diffusion coupled recovery (Figure 4 B). The parameter estimates pertaining to Model\n1 listed in Table 1 show that the estimates of D and a for the non-palmitoylated GFP-Ras2C318S are\nvery close to each other and statistically indistinguishable at 95% significance level. Model 2 parameter\nestimates show that the additional parameter koff is very close to and indistinguishable from zero. The\nWRSS for Model 2 is higher than that for Model 1 and Akaike and Schwarz criteria are lower for Model\n1, which makes it preferable to Model 2. Therefore, GFP-Ras2C318S FRAP recovery is governed by\ndiffusion with a mean diffusivity ~0.28 \u03bcm2/s.\nFig. 5A and 5B show the simulations of FRAP Model 2 for wild-type GFP-Ras2, where membrane\nbound fluorophore exchanges with a well mixed cytosolic compartment. The bleach ROI dependence of\nrecovery solutions for 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm and 0.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcm ROI sizes varies with the rate of exchange. A\nfast exchange rate makes the FRAP recovery independent of bleach ROI size as expected in a reaction\ndominated process (Fig 4B) [3, 9]. Smaller rate constants representing slower exchange also show faster\nrecovery when compared to recovery from pure lateral diffusion (Fig 4A). Figures 5 C and D\ndemonstrate diffusion-exchange model simulations for GFP-Ras2C318S data, confirming the findings in\nFig. 5 A and B. Clearly, Model 2 can match the data as well as Model 1, but does so only when it\nactually does reduce to Model 1. Therefore Model 2 may indeed effectively describe what is happening.\nHowever, it does so in such a way that the exchange processes do not occur with observable significance\nover the timescales of these experiments.\nSeveral conclusions can be made from these data. First, single and dual lipidated forms of GFP-Ras2\nexhibit different rates of diffusion when associated with the yeast plasma membrane (Table 1). The\n9\n\n\fsingle modified form, which only has a farnesyl moiety, diffuses approximately 4 times faster than the\ndual lipidated form containing both farnesyl and palmitoyl modifications. Mammalian H-Ras undergoes\nthe same two modifications, but the estimated diffusivity of Ras2 in yeast plasma membrane (0.075\n\u03bcm2/s) is slower than that of H-Ras (1 \u03bcm2/s at 22 oC) and K-Ras (1 \u03bcm2/s at 37 oC or 0.63 \u03bcm2/s at 22\noC) observed in mammalian cell plasma membranes [26, 27]. The slower diffusivity of Ras2 in yeast\nplasma membrane could be due to different membrane composition of yeast membranes compared to\nmammalian plasma membranes. Henis et al. [3] have shown that Ras diffusion is sensitive to lipid\ncomposition of the plasma membrane. We also performed FRAP on a GFP-fused integral membrane\nprotein, PMA1 (GFP-PMA1). GFP-PMA1, an integral membrane protein with at least ten membrane\nspanning regions, diffuses much more slowly than a lipid anchored protein such as Ras2. Fig. 6 shows\nnormalized fluorescence recovery of both GFP-Ras2 and GFP-PMA1 for 1 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm ROI. GFPPMA1 normalized fluorescence recovers fully at approximately 250 seconds, whereas its nonnormalized fluorescence recovers to only 40 percent of the initial fluorescence (data not shown). This\nresult is in agreement with the study by Valdez-Taubas and Pelham on another trans-membrane integral\nprotein Sso1 [28].\nUnexpectedly, the fluorescence recovery of both forms GFP-Ras2 (single and double lipidated) in yeast\nis dominated by diffusion, with no evidence for exchange. Experiments designed to measure exchange\nof lipidated peptides between model membranes have shown that dual lipidated (prenyl and palmitate)\npeptides exchange slowly with intervesicle equilibration half-times in hours [29], whereas single\nlipidated peptides (farnesyl) exchange very rapidly with intervesicle equilibration half time in seconds\n[30]. However, this is not observed for the singly farnesylated GFP-Ras2C318S proteins. There are of\ncourse many differences between model membranes and cells with respect to sterol-phospholipid\nstoichiometries and the presence of high protein concentrations in cell membranes [31]. It might also\nreflect the difference between the composition of yeast and mammalian plasma membranes. The lipid\nand protein composition of mammalian and yeast plasma membrane differs greatly [31-33] with the role\nof lipid composition of the membrane exerting a major influence on whether the Ras mobility is\ndiffusion or exchange dominated [3]. Henis et al. [3] have demonstrated that cholesterol depletion in\nCOS-7 cells changes the mobility of palmitoylation mutants of H-Ras from being dominated by lateral\ndiffusion to exchange dominated behavior. The diffusivity of these mutants was measured to be 5 \u03bcm2/s\nat 22 oC, which is five fold higher than that of H-Ras [34]. Goodwin et al. [34] concluded that a\nsignificant fraction of H-Ras palmitoylation mutant existed as a soluble cytoplasmic fraction based on\nFCS data however their data were not tested with FRAP beam size or ROI size analyses.\nFinally, we noted that the normalized fluorescence of GFP-Ras2 recovers as a single pool of GFP-Ras2\nimplying that the fluorophore diffuses as a single species. This was also somewhat surprising because\nof the nature of the post translational modifications at the C-terminus of the Ras2 protein. Ras2 was\nchosen for this study because it is initially synthesized as a soluble precursor and rapidly associates with\nthe cytosolic face of the plasma membrane through dual lipidation (farnesylation and palmitoylation) of\nthe C-terminal CCaaX box [11-13]. Farnesylation is irreversible, whereas palmitoylation is potentially\nreversible and and hence, Ras has the potential to cycle between the acylated and deacylated state.\nBased on this notion, the acylation/deacylation cycle is proposed to be required for proper subcellular\ntrafficking of Ras2 [27, 35]. The recovery of GFP-Ras2 fluorescence as a single species in the wild type\nstrain suggesting that Ras2 is almost entirely dually lipidated. Any significant presence of the nonpalmitoylated form of Ras2 would have to be described by a two-species diffusion model, which would\nresult in a failure of the single species model. The absence of exchange suggests that acylation does not\n\"lock\" the molecule into membrane association. Therefore, one possible model is that palmitoylation\ndirects GFP-Ras2 to the plasma membrane. Consistent with this, the distribution of nonpalmitoylated\nGFP-Ras2C318S in cells at \"steady-state\" is primarily on endomembranes (Fig. 1B).\n10\n\n\fConfocal FRAP\nCommercial confocal microscopes have made FRAP widely accessible. However, quantitative analysis\nof confocal FRAP requires development of appropriate mathematical models pertinent to the experiment\nand the system being studied. The presence of chemical reactions complicates the analysis even in the\ncase of Gaussian spot photobleaching where the theory is well developed [2]. Peters and colleagues [4,\n5] developed line-scanning microphotolysis and numerical simulations to measure lateral and 3D\ndiffusion in solutions and in cells. Braeckmans et al. [6, 36] described the mathematical basis for 3D\nFRAP with an arbitrary 2D geometry bleach ROI and for line FRAP, and Braga et al.[8] developed a\nmodel that accounts for diffusion of fluorophores during bleaching. These efforts were focused on\nderiving analytical expressions that can be used to fit data to facilitate ease of use by biologists in\ngeneral. A particular feature of such approaches is the description of postbleach intensity using an\nanalytical function with estimable parameters that must be fitted to the postbleach intensity profile. This\nis critical since this fitted analytical solution constitutes the initial condition for the recovery. In contrast,\nour approach has only one initial condition, which is the prebleach fluophore concentration distribution.\nThe bleach frame and recovery are computed by simulating the bleaching and recovery processes with\nthe same parameters for the entire model, requiring no additional fitting of the bleach profile alone. Fig\n7 shows that the Model 1 predictions of the spatial bleach frame intensity profile are validated by\nexperimental image data. We also account for the change in total fluorophore concentration during\nbleaching to account for fluorophore mass conservation, which is crucial for simulating the exchange of\nfluorophore in Model 2. Sprague et al. [9] developed models to account for diffusion and binding to\nimmobile binding sites in circular spot photobleaching experiments. Dushek et al. [10] theoretically\nanalyzed a membrane localized ligand-receptor binding and diffusion problem where the binding sites\nare not immobile to determine parameter regimes for model identifiability.\nIn our present study we address a different biophysical problem, where the membrane associated\nfluorophores, which diffuse fast in the cytosol, upon association with the membrane, diffuse at a slower\nrate and are not immobile. Our simulations account for both translational diffusion and exchange\nprocesses, and diffusion during bleaching. FRAP experiments were performed with different bleach ROI\nsizes to distinguish between possible mechanisms contributing to the recovery process. A similar\nexperimental technique was developed by Henis et al. [3] using Gaussian-spot FRAP by changing the\nbeam size to determine the contribution of chemical exchange processes to FRAP recovery in addition\nto translational diffusion of Ras isoforms in mammalian cells. Experimental data reported by Henis et al.\n[3] indicate that the exchange of free cytosolic fluorophore is not diffusion-limited, which is consistent\nwith our simulation approach. Henis et al. [3] point to the difficulties in performing and interpreting\nconfocal FRAP for analyzing diffusion and exchange processes, such as time of photobleaching and\nimage acquisition, which were overcome partly in our study with small bleach ROI's and fast image\nacquisition combined with data analysis by computational modeling. In summary we were able to\nquantitatively test whether wild type GFP-Ras2 and palmitoylation mutant GFP-Ras2C318S in yeast\ndiffused laterally in the plasma membrane as a single species on the time scale of our FRAP experiments.\nConclusions\nROI size analysis of FRAP experiments shows that the data are consistent with a single-species lateral\ndiffusion model. Simulations of diffusion and exchange of GFP-Ras2 between membrane and cytosol\nshow that the spatial dependence of FRAP curves can be used to account for exchange if it occurs.\nLarger rates of exchange diminish the spatial dependence of FRAP. The singly lipidated mutant GFPRas2C318S also diffuses as a single species in the plasma membrane. In summary the present study\ndeveloped a confocal microscopy based method to investigate the mobility of membrane associated\n11\n\n\ffluorophores and reported for the first time the mobility and the nature of diffusion of wild type GFPRas2 and singly lipidated mutant GFP-Ras2C318S in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\n12\n\n\fAppendix\nA.

A7, A8 for one time step followed by Eq. B4 for the same time step. The same scheme is\nimplemented during recovery by first solving Eqs. A3, A4 for one time step followed by Eq. B4 for the\nsame time step. We also update the total mass of the system during the bleach frame simulation to\naccount for loss of fluorophore during photobleaching.\nThe spatial discretization step size and time step size were chosen by comparing the relative error in the\nsolution with change in spatial and time step sizes, and optimizing for computing time. We find that a\nspatial step size of 0.05 \u03bcm and a time step size (11 ms) gives a solution with less than 5% relative error\n(relative to sum of squares of residuals at 0.025 \u03bcm spatial step size) and the least computing time for\nthat error.\n\nC. Estimation of parameter precisions and model parsimony criteria\nThe methods summarized in this section are described in detail by Landaw and Distefano [37]. We\nfollow their terminology and notation in this section of the Appendix. To characterize the precision of\nour parameter estimates, we calculated an approximate variance-covariance matrix and the percent\ncoefficient of variation of the parameters as per Eqs. 10-12 in Landaw and Distefano [37]. We computed\nthe sensitivity of time courses of fluorescence recovery for a 1% change in the values of the P adjustable\nparameters s(t, p), where p is the vector of P adjustable parameters, t denotes time and s denotes the\nvector of sensitivities. For every time point we then computed a P-by-P information matrix M(ti) using\nEq. 10 from Landaw and Distefano (1984) shown below:\nM (ti ) = s(ti , p)s T (ti , p ) / \u03c3 2 (ti ) ,\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere \u03c32(ti) is the standard deviation of the experimental measurement at each time point.\nThe total information matrix M is computed by adding all M(ti):\nN\n\nM = \u2211 M (ti ) ,\n\n(C2)\n\ni =1\n\nwhere N is the number of time points in the fitted time course.\nAn approximation to the variance-covariance matrix COV (p\u02c6 ) of the optimized values of the adjustable\nparameters p\u0302 may be computed by inverting \u03c3 2 M , where \u03c3 2 is treated as 1 since we assume that the\nerror variances are equal to the standard deviations of measured data at each time point. Table 1 reports\nthe computed coefficients of variation ( 100 \u00d7 p\u02c6 j / COV ( p\u02c6 ) jj ) for the adjustable parameters.\nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwartz Criterion (SC) were calculated using the following\nequations:\n\nAIC = WRSS + 2 P\nSC = WRSS + P ln( N )\n\n15\n\n(C3)\n(C4)\n\n\fTo test that any decrease in WRSS with Model 2, which has one additional adjustable parameter in\ncomparison to Model 1, is statistically significant, we computed the F statistic using the following\nequation:\n(WRSS Model1 \u2212 WRSSModel 2 )\n,\n(C5)\nF=\nWRSS Model1 /( N \u2212 P2 )\nwhere N is the total number of points in the fitted time course, P2 is the number of adjustable parameters\nin Model 2. The test statistic has an asymptotic F distribution with (1, N-P2) degrees of freedom under\nthe null hypothesis that Model 1 is correct. A P-value of less than 0.05 will lead to the rejection of the\nnull hypothesis at 95% significance level.\nParameter confidence intervals based on a t-distribution were derived to test whether a hypothesized\nvalue of a parameter was different in a statistically significant manner from the estimated value at 1-\u03b1\nprobability. The number of degrees of freedom of the t-distribution for Model j is N-PModelj.\nCI = p\u02c6 i \u00b1 t1\u2212\u03b1 / 2 SD ( p\u02c6 i )\n(C6)\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are thankful to Dr. Ranjan Dash for helpful discussions on numerical methods.
