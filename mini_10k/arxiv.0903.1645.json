The remarkable discovery of E7(7) /SU (8) coset describing the\nscalar sector of N = 8, D = 4 supergravity [3, 4] led to an earnest exploration of hidden symmetries\nfor supergravity theories [5]. It soon became clear that a large number of supergravity theories reduce to gravity and p-forms coupled to non-linear sigma models upon dimensional reduction. Such\nsigma models are maps from a lower dimensional base space to a target space. The target space\nis generally a coset G/H, where G is the group of global isometries of the target space, and H is\na subgroup of G. The symmetry group of a coset model can be used to generate new solutions by\napplying a group transformation to a coset representative of a seed solution. During the second\nsuperstring revolution these solution generating techniques were used extensively to generate a rich\nspectrum of black holes in string theory (see e.g., [6, 7, 8] for reviews).\nIn this paper we explore these solution generating techniques in the context of minimal supergravity in five dimensions. Minimal supergravity in five dimensions is the simplest supersymmetric\nextension of vacuum gravity. The bosonic sector of the theory is the Einstein-Maxwell theory with\na Chern-Simons term. This theory also arises as a consistent truncation of eleven dimensional supergravity. As a result, supersymmetric and near supersymmetric black holes of five dimensional\nsupergravity admit microscopic interpretation in terms of intersecting M-branes.\nThe discovery of black rings [9, 10, 11] (see [12, 13] for reviews and further references) has\nattracted renewed interest in exact solutions of this theory. A five parameter family of black ring\nsolutions characterized by mass, two angular momenta, electric charge, and dipole charge is conjectured to exist in minimal supergravity [14]. At present, though, all known smooth black rings\nhave no more than three independent parameters [11, 14, 15]. The three parameter family in [14]\nwas constructed using boosts and string dualities, whereas the three parameter family of [15] was\nconstructed using inverse scattering methods. The solutions of [14, 15] do not admit any non-trivial\nsupersymmetric limit to the BPS black ring [11]. It is likely that efficient solution generating techniques, like the one explored in this paper, would allow one to construct the most general black ring\nthat will describe thermal excitations above the supersymmetric ring.\nThe solution generating technique we investigate in this paper is based on the hidden symmetry\narising upon dimensional reduction of five dimensional supergravity down to three dimensions. The\nresulting theory is three dimensional gravity coupled to a non linear sigma model. The sigma model\nis globally invariant under the lowest rank exceptional Lie group G2(2) [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] 2 . The\ntarget space of the sigma model depends on the signature of the three dimensional base space: it is\nG2 /SO(4) for the Lorentzian signature or G2 /(SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R)) for the Euclidean signature.\n\nA detailed study of the coset model solution generating techniques for this theory was also\n\nperformed in [21] (see [22, 23] for reviews). The formalism of [21] was used in [24] to generate a new\nrotating charged Kaluza-Klein black hole solution, and in [25] to establish a uniqueness theorem for\nsolutions) [2]. The Geroch group has been identified with the affine extension of SL(2, R), namely the affine Kac\u2013\nMoody group SL(2, R)+ . In this paper, we restrict ourselves to finite dimensional hidden symmetries.\n2 G\n2(2) is the maximally split real form of G2 . Since it is the only real form of G2 that is relevant for our purposes,\nwe denote G2(2) simply by G2 . At the level of Lie algebras, we denote the maximally split real form of g2 , often\nwritten as g2(2) , simply by g2 .\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n4\n\ncharged rotating black holes in this theory. The gravitational subsector of minimal five dimensional\nsupergravity was analyzed in [26, 27] and the extended U (1)3 five dimensional supergravitiy was\ntreated in [28, 29]. Supersymmetric solutions of both gauged and ungauged five dimensional supergravities were studied using the G2 /SO(4) sigma model in [30]. Our approach is complementary to\ntheirs in a number of ways. In [21] a derivation of the three dimensional sigma model was given\nthat had the advantage of being more transparent for generating solutions, though the G2 symmetries were not immediately evident. The G2 symmetries were made manifest by solving appropriate\nKilling equations on the coset manifold (see also [31]). The resulting symmetry transformations\nwere then interpreted through their action on the three dimensional fields. In this paper we use\nthe derivation of the coset model performed in [18, 19, 20], where the G2 symmetries are manifest\nfrom the beginning. The originality of our approach lies in decomposing at the outset the symmetry\ngenerators of G2 in three different subalgebras: nilpotent, Cartan, and pseudo-compact generators3.\nWe show that only the pseudo-compact generators generate non-trivial charges. Furthermore, using\nthe prescription of [26], we show that all pseudo-compact generators also preserve the Kaluza-Klein\nasymptotics. This motivates us to focus our study mainly on the charging transformations in the\ncontext of black strings, while we only mention some results for asymptotically flat black holes and\nblack rings.\nOur main results can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We show that the action of the Cartan and nilpotent subalgebras on a general seed solution\namounts to scaling and gauge transformations, respectively.\n\n\u2022 We study in detail how the pseudo-compact generators generalize the metric of the Kerr string.\nWe identify each generator with a charging transformation.\n\n\u2022 Using these transformations we construct: (i) a spinning electrically charged black string where\n\nthe electric charge is uniformly smeared over the string direction, and (ii) a spinning magnetic\none brane. These solutions were also constructed recently in string theory in [32] using boosts\nand string dualities. The G2 generating technique is more efficient for finding these solutions\nin minimal supergravity.\n\n\u2022 We present an analysis of physical properties and thermodynamics of these black strings.\n\u2022 We explore in some detail the relation between these black strings and black rings. These black\nstrings describe, respectively, the infinite radius limit of the yet to be found doubly spinning\nelectrically charged black ring and doubly spinning dipole black ring.\nThanks to the efficiency of the G2 method, the black string describing the infinite radius limit of\nthe most general black ring of five dimensional minimal supergravity can also be constructed. The\nsolution and its thermodynamics will be presented in a separate publication [33].\n3 When\n\nthe dimensional reduction is performed along spacelike Killing vectors only, this decomposition is identical\n\nto the Iwasawa decomposition. The definition of pseudo-compact generators is given in section 3.\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n5\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start with a brief overview of the coset\nmodel solution generating technique for four dimensional gravity in section 2 emphasizing the role\nof the Iwasawa decomposition. The dimensional reduction of five dimensional minimal supergravity\nfrom five to three dimensions is performed in section 3 and the resulting non-linear sigma model is\npresented. For ease of reference some basic facts about G2 are collected at the beginning of section\n3. A concluding \"recipe\" for generating new solutions using G2 dualities is given at the end of\nsection 3. In section 4 we show that the action of the Cartan and nilpotent subalgebras on a general\nseed solution amounts to scaling and gauge transformations, respectively. In section 5 we study\nthe action of the pseudo-compact generators on a variety of solutions of interest: black holes, black\nrings, and black strings. Our main focus is on black strings. We construct the spinning electric and\nspinning magnetic black strings of five dimensional supergravity. In this section we also present an\nanalysis of physical properties of these black strings and study their thermodynamics. Finally, we\nclose with a brief discussion in section 6. The details of the 7 \u00d7 7 representation of G2 that we use\nare relegated to appendix A. In appendix B we present an argument that under G2 dualities the\n\nnumber of commuting Killing symmetries cannot change. In appendix C we identify the generators\nof the subgroup K\u0303 of G2 that preserve the Kaluza-Klein asymptotics and asymptotic flatness. A\ndetailed dictionary with the results of [26] is presented in appendix D.\n\n2\n\nWarm-up: duality in four dimensional gravity\n\nWe start by summarizing the main ideas of the solution generating technique based on coset models\nusing the simple example of four dimensional vacuum gravity reduced on a timelike Killing direction\n(see [34] for a pedagogical review). The standard reduction from four to three dimensions takes the\nform\nds2 = \u2212e\u2212\u03c6 (dt + A)2 + e\u03c6 ds3(3) ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the scalar dilaton \u03c6, the one-form potential A, and the base metric ds2(3) only depend on three\n\nspatial coordinates. The reduced Einstein equations can be derived from three dimensional gravity\ncoupled to a non-linear sigma model [1]\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\n1\n1\nL = (3) g (3) R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 e2\u03c6 (\u2202\u03c7)2 .\n2\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe sigma model consists of two scalar fields (\u03c6, \u03c7), where the so-called 'twist potential' or 'axion' \u03c7\nis related to the 1-form A by the three dimensional Hodge dualization of the field strength F := dA,\nd\u03c7 = \u22c6(e\u22122\u03c6 F ) =\n\n1 p(3)\ng\u01eb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd e\u22122\u03c6 F \u03bc\u03bd dx\u03b1 .\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe target space of the coset model is SL(2, R)/SO(2). As a result, the reduced Einstein equations\nare invariant under the Ehlers group SL(2, R) acting transitively on the target space as an isometry.\nThis SL(2, R) action can be used as a solution generating technique [1]. Starting with a solution of\ngeneral relativity one first constructs a set of scalars (\u03c6, \u03c7). Then, by acting with an element of the\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n6\n\nisometry group one finds a transformed set of scalars (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c7\u2032 ). Dualizing back the new twist potential\n\u03c7\u2032 to the one form A\u2032 one obtains a new solution of general relativity.\n\nA very convenient way to systematically classify the action of the SL(2, R) transformations is\n\nto consider the Iwasawa decomposition of the corresponding Lie algebra sl(2, R); that is to choose\nas generators the following combinations of Chevalley-Serre generators {h, e, f }:\nh,\n\ne,\n\ne \u2212 f,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere h generates the Cartan subalgebra h, e the nilpotent subalgebra n+ , and e \u2212 f the maximal\ncompact subalgebra k = so(2).\n\nThese three subalgebras act on solutions in the following way:\n\u2022 h: scaling transformation: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + \u03bcs , \u03c7 \u2192 e\u2212\u03bcs \u03c7\n\u2022 n+ : gauge transformation: \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 + \u03bcg , and\n\u2022 k: proper Ehlers transformation: (\u03c7 \u2212 ie\u2212\u03c6 )\u22121 \u2192 (\u03c7 \u2212 ie\u2212\u03c6 )\u22121 + \u03bce , which generates the\nTaub\u2013NUT charge from the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nBelow we will see that a decomposition resembling the Iwasawa decomposition of G2 plays a very\nsimilar role in five dimensional minimal supergravity. A general element of the Cartan subalgebra\nh of g2 acts as a scaling transformation, while elements of the nilpotent subalgebra n+ act as\ngauge transformations. The most interesting generators belong to what we call the pseudo-compact\nalgebra. When the dimensional reduction is performed over one timelike and one spacelike direction,\nthe pseudo-compact algebra is sl(2, R) \u2295 sl(2, R). As we will see below, the generators of the pseudo-\n\ncompact algebra generate non-trivial charges, including for example the five dimensional electric\ncharge.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nDualities in five dimensional minimal supergravity\nGeneralities on G2\n\nIn order to fully appreciate the G2 duality of five-dimensional minimal supergravity, some basic facts\nabout this Lie group are needed. For the purpose of reference, we collect here the results we need.\nFor further details we refer the reader to standard references, such as [35].\nThe algebra g2 is the smallest of the exceptional Lie algebras. Its rank is 2 and and its dimension\nis 14. Its Dynkin diagram is presented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Dynkin diagram of G2 .\n\n\f7\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\nEach node of this diagram corresponds to a triple of Chevalley generators {Ha , Ea , Fa }, a = 1, 2.\n\nThe Ha 's span the Cartan subalgebra h of g2 . The Ea 's are the generators associated to the two\nsimple roots \u03b1\n~ 1 and \u03b1\n~ 2 of g2 . These generators satisfy the Chevalley relations\n[H1 , E1 ] =\n\n2E1 ,\n\n[H2 , E1 ] = \u22123E1 ,\n\n[E1 , F1 ] = H1 ,\n\n[H1 , E2 ] =\n\n\u2212E2 ,\n\n[H2 , E2 ] = 2E2 ,\n\n[E2 , F2 ] = H2 .\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe simple roots belong to the dual h\u22c6 of h.\nBy taking multiple commutators of Ea 's, and using Serre relations, one obtains a set of four\nmore positive generators Ek , k = 3, . . . , 6. More explicitly, one can take them to be\nE3 = [E1 , E2 ] ,\n\nE4 = [E3 , E2 ] ,\n\nE5 = [E4 , E2 ] ,\n\nE6 = [E1 , E5 ] .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe set of the six positive generators Ej , j = 1, . . . , 6 form a nilpotent subalgebra n+ of g2 . To each\nof these generators corresponds a negative generator Fj , associated to the corresponding negative\nroot, and they form another nilpotent subalgebra n\u2212 of g2 .

The set of elements\ninvariant under the Chevalley involution is the maximal compact subalgebra k:\n\b\nk = x \u2208 g2 | \u03c4 (x) = x .\n\n(3.9)\n\nIt is generated by the elements {ei \u2212 fi }, and in the case of g2 it is isomorphic to so(4). In the\n\nstudy of hidden symmetries, the Chevalley involution and the maximal compact subalgebra are of\nimportance when one compactifies only on spacelike directions.\nIn the following, we will be interested in compactifying five dimensional minimal supergravity\nover one spacelike and one timelike Killing direction. When one first compactifies along a direction\nof signature \u01eb1 and then along a direction of signature \u01eb2 -where \u01eb1,2 take values +1 or \u22121 depending\n\nupon whether the reduction is performed over a spacelike or a timelike direction-, the pertinent\ninvolution \u03c4\u0303 is given by the following relations\n\u03c4\u0303 (h1 ) =\n\n\u2212h1 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (h2 ) = \u2212h2 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (e1 ) =\n\n\u2212\u01eb1 \u01eb2 f1 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (e2 ) = \u2212\u01eb1 f2 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (e3 ) = \u2212\u01eb2 f3 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (e4 ) =\n\n\u2212\u01eb1 \u01eb2 f4 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (e5 ) = \u2212\u01eb2 f5 ,\n\n\u03c4\u0303 (e6 ) = \u2212\u01eb1 f6 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nNote that for a reduction over two spacelike directions, \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = +1, one finds back the Chevalley\ninvolution (3.8). In the case \u01eb1 = \u22121 and \u01eb2 = +1, the \u03c4\u0303 involution differs from the Chevalley\ninvolution because \u03c4\u0303 (ei ) = +fi for some generators.\n\nThe subalgebra of elements fixed under \u03c4\u0303 is no longer compact. We call it a 'pseudo-compact'\nsubalgebra and denote it by k\u0303. It consists of all the elements of the form {ei + \u03c4\u0303 (ei )}, that is,\nk1\n\n= e1 + f1 ,\n\nk2 = e2 + f2 ,\n\nk3 = e3 \u2212 f3 ,\n\nk4\n\n= e4 + f4 ,\n\nk5 = e5 \u2212 f5 ,\n\nk6 = e6 + f6 .\n\n(3.11)\n\nThese generators generate the sl(2, R) \u2295 sl(2, R) algebra. An easy way to see this is to rewrite them\n\nin the new basis as follows\nkh\n\n=\n\nke\n\n=\n\nkf\n\n=\n\n\u221a\n1\n(k1 + 3k4 ) ,\n2\n\u221a\n3\n(k2 + k3 ) +\n4\n\u221a\n3\n(k2 \u2212 k3 ) +\n4\n\n\u221a\n1\n(3k1 \u2212 3k4 )\n2\n\u221a\n3\n1\n3\n(k5 + k6 ) ,\nk\u0304e =\n(k2 + k3 ) \u2212 (k5 + k6 )\n4\n4\n4\n\u221a\n1\n3\n3\n(k6 \u2212 k5 ) ,\nk\u0304f =\n(k2 \u2212 k3 ) + (k5 \u2212 k6 ) .\n4\n4\n4\nk\u0304h =\n\n(3.12)\n\nIn this basis we recognize the usual sl(2, R) commutation relations for the unbarred generators\n[kh , ke ] =\n\n2ke ,\n\n[kh , kf ] = \u22122kf ,\n\n[ke , kf ] = kh .\n\n(3.13)\n\nIt can be easily checked that the barred generators also satisfy the sl(2, R) commutation relations,\nwhile the commutators between the unbarred and barred generators vanish.\n\n\f9\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n3.2\n\nDimensional reduction from five to three dimensions\n\nThe dimensional reductions of five dimensional minimal supergravity to three dimensions were first\nstudied by Cremmer, Julia, Lu, and Pope [20], and by Mizoguchi and Ohta [17]. When the reduction\nis performed over two spacelike Killing directions one obtains three dimensional Lorentzian gravity\ncoupled to the G2 /SO(4) coset model. On the other hand, when the reduction is performed over one\ntimelike and one spacelike Killing direction one obtains three dimensional Euclidean gravity coupled\nto the G2 /(SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R)) coset model. In this section, we briefly review this dimensional\n\nreduction, treating both cases simultaneously. See [36, 37] for details on compactifications along\ntimelike directions.\nFive dimensional minimal supergravity contains a metric g5 and a gauge potential A5(1) whose\n5\nfield strength is F(2)\n= dA5(1) . It is the simplest supersymmetric extension of vacuum five dimensional\n\ngravity. The bosonic sector of the theory is the Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simons term.\nOur starting point is the bosonic part of the Lagrangian, which is given by\nL5 = R5 \u22c6 1 \u2212\n\n1\n1\n5\n5\n5\n5\n\u2227 A5(1) .\n\u2227 F(2)\n+ \u221a F(2)\n\u2227 F(2)\n\u22c6 F(2)\n2\n3 3\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe reduction of the five dimensional metric g5 leads to the following three-dimensional fields: a\nthree-dimensional metric g3 , two dilatons \u03c61 and \u03c62 , a scalar \u03c71 , and two Kaluza-Klein one-form\npotentials A1(1) and A2(1) . More explicitly, these fields arise from the following dimensional reduction\nansatz for the five dimensinal metric\nds25\n\n= e\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c61 +\u03c62\n3\n\n+\u01eb1 e\n\nds23 + \u01eb2 e\n\n\u2212 \u221a23 \u03c61\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62\n3\n\n(dz4 + A2(1) )2\n\n(dz5 + \u03c71 dz4 + A1(1) )2 ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere the fields \u03c61 , \u03c62 , A1(1) , A2(1) , \u03c71 , and the three-dimensional metric ds23 do not depend on the z4\n\nand z5 coordinates. One can also think of this reduction as a two step process. The first step being\nthe reduction from five to four dimensions over z5 , and the second being the reduction from four\nto three dimensions over z4 . In each step, the reduction can be performed over either a spacelike\nor a timelike Killing direction. The sign \u01ebi is +1 when the reduction is performed over a spacelike\ndirection, and \u22121 for a timelike direction. We denote the field strengths associated to \u03c71 , A1(1) , and\n1\n2\n, and F(2)\nrespectively.

The six doublets \u03b1\n~ 1, . . . , \u03b1\n~ 6 correspond\nprecisely to the six positive roots of the exceptional Lie algebra g2 , given in section 3.1.\n\nIt is clear from the Lagrangian (3.18) that the roots \u03b1\n~ 1, \u03b1\n~ 2 and \u03b1\n~ 3 are respectively associated\nto the three axions \u03c71 , \u03c72 and \u03c73 . The other roots come with one-form potentials that in three\ndimensions can be dualized into scalars. The signs of the exponentials appearing in front of the\nkinetic terms of the Lagrangian (3.18) indicate whether the field associated to the root is a scalar\n~ or a one-form potential (\u2212~\n~ that we need to dualize. Note that the signatures of\nfield (+~\n\u03b1 * \u03c6)\n\u03b1 * \u03c6)\nthe compactified directions do not appear in the definitions of the field strengths. They only appear\nas the signs of the kinetic terms in the Lagrangian (3.18).\nWe now define the axions \u03c74 , \u03c75 , and \u03c76 dual to the one forms A(1) , A1(1) , and A2(1) . These\n\naxions are associated to the roots \u03b1\n~ 4, \u03b1\n~ 5 , and \u03b1\n~ 6 . Recall that in the process of dualisation the role of\nthe Bianchi identities is interchanged with the role of the equations of motion. Therefore, the easiest\nway to do the dualisation is to treat the field strengths as fundamental fields (see e.g., [34]). To this\nend, we first rewrite the Chern-Simons term of the dimensionally reduced Lagrangian in terms of\n1\n2\nthe field strengths F(2) , F(2)\nand F(2)\nas\n\nChern-Simons =\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a (\u03c72 d\u03c73 \u2212 \u03c73 d\u03c72 ) \u2227 F(2) + \u221a \u03c72 (\u03c73 d\u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72 d\u03c73 ) \u2227 F(2)\n3\n3 3\n1\n2\n+ \u221a (\u03c73 \u2212 \u03c71 \u03c72 )(\u03c73 d\u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72 d\u03c73 ) \u2227 F(2)\n.\n3 3\n\n(3.19)\n\nAs the next step we introduce the axions \u03c74 , \u03c75 and \u03c76 as Lagrange multipliers for the Bianchi\n1\n2\nidentities of the field strengths F(2) , F(2)\n, and F(2)\n. By construction, the variations with respect to\n\nthe axions give the Bianchi identities.

Q is invariant under the involution \u03c4\u0303 defined\n\nin (3.10) and P is anti-invariant under the involution \u03c4\u0303 :\nQ\n\n=\n\nP\n\n=\n\n1\n(v + \u03c4\u0303 (v)) ,\n2\n1\n(v \u2212 \u03c4\u0303 (v)) .\n2\n\n(3.26)\n(3.27)\n\nOne can now write a Lagrangian that is manifestly invariant under global G2 and local K\u0303 as (see\ne.g., section 9.1 of [40])\n\n1\nLcoset = \u2212 Tr(\u22c6P \u2227 P) .\n2\n\n(3.28)\n\nWith the choice of the coset representative (3.23) the element v is found to be\nv = dVV \u22121\n\n=\n\n1 \u2032\n1\n1\n1\n1\n~ 1\n~\n~\n~ 2 *\u03c6\ne1 \u2212 e 2 \u03b1\nF(1)1 e2 + e 2 \u03b1~ 3 *\u03c6 F(1)2 e3\n\u03c61 h1 + \u03c6\u20322 h2 + e 2 \u03b1~ 1 *\u03c6 F(1)2\n2\n2\n1\n\n~\n\n1\n\n~\n\n1\n\n~\n\ne 2 \u03b1~ 4 *\u03c6 G(1)4 e4 \u2212 e 2 \u03b1~ 5 *\u03c6 G(1)5 e5 + e 2 \u03b1~ 6 *\u03c6 G(1)6 e6 ,\n\n(3.29)\n\nfrom which P can be readily constructed. By an explicit calculation one then finds that the coset\nLagrangian (3.28) coincides with the scalar part of the reduced supergravity Lagrangian (3.21) for\nthe Cartan involution (3.10).\n\n3.4\n\nActing with G2 in practice\n\nRecall that our goal is to act on a set of three-dimensional scalar fields (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c71 , . . . , \u03c76 ) with\nan element G2 . From the previous section, the way to go seems to be: first construct the coset\nrepresentative V from the scalar fields, and then act as in equation (3.24) V \u2192 kVg, where g is a\n\nglobal element of G2 and k, the compensator, is a local element of K\u0303 that must be chosen in order\n\nto keep the Borel gauge of V. In practice, however, choosing the right compensator k turns out to\nbe a very difficult task in the cases of most interest.\n\nA much easier way to act on the scalars is provided by the matrix M,\nM := (V \u266f )V ,\n\n(3.30)\n\nwhere \u266f stands for the generalized transposition, which is defined on the generators of g2 by\n\u266f(x) := \u2212\u03c4\u0303 (x)\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 g2 .\n\n(3.31)\n\nThe matrix M transforms under V \u2192 kVg in the simple way\nM \u2192 (g \u266f )Mg .\n\n(3.32)\n\nThe new scalars can be extracted from the transformed matrix M. Note that, the use of the matrix\nM completely avoids the need of constructing the compensator k. In summary, our strategy to find\n\nthe transformed set of scalars under a G2 action is the following:\n\n\u2022 start with a seed solution of five-dimensional minimal supergravity with two Killing vectors,\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n13\n\n\u2022 reduce this solution to three dimensions using the ansatz (3.15) and (3.16) and dualize the\none-forms to obtain a set of eight scalar fields,\n\n\u2022 construct the matrix M,\n\u2022 act on M with an element g of G2 as in equation (3.32),\n\u2022 extract from the new M the new scalar fields,\n\u2022 uplift back to a five-dimensional solution.\nIn the last step, remember that \u03c74 , \u03c75 , and \u03c76 are defined in terms of A(1) , A1(1) , and A2(1) through\n\nthe duality relations (3.20), and as a consequence, extracting these one-forms requires integrations\nwhich may in general be very difficult. Another way to obtain A(1) , A1(1) , and A2(1) , that may be\n\nsometimes easier to apply, was described in [26] for SL(3, R)/SO(2, 1) coset model. It can be readily\nadapted for the case of our interest. The construction proceeds as follows. We first note that due\nto the identity\nM\u22121 dM = 2V \u22121 PV ,\n\n(3.33)\n\nthe coset Lagrangian (3.28) can also be written in terms of the matrix M as\n1\nLcoset = \u2212 Tr(\u22c6(M\u22121 dM) \u2227 (M\u22121 dM)) .\n8\n\n(3.34)\n\nFrom this form of the Lagrangian it is easy to see that the equation of motion for the matrix M\n\ntakes the form of the conservation of a current\n\nd \u22c6 (M\u22121 dM) = 0 .\n\n(3.35)\n\nAs a result, on-shell one can define a new matrix N such that\nM\u22121 dM = \u22c6 dN .\n\n(3.36)\n\nThe one-forms A(1) , A1(1) , and A2(1) can be directly extracted from the matrix N . Furthermore, the\n\nmatrix N transforms under a global G2 transformation in a simple way\nN \u2212\u2192 g \u22121 N g.\n\n(3.37)\n\nTherefore, the transformed one-forms can also be directly extracted from the transformed matrix\nN . In the 7 \u00d7 7 representation of G2 that we use, given explicitly in appendix A, and for \u01eb1 = \u22121,\n\u01eb2 = +1, the relations between the components of the matrix N and the one-forms are:\nN6,1\n\n=\n\nN5,1\n\n=\n\nN4,1\n\n=\n\n1\n\u2212 A2(1) ,\n2\n1\n\u2212 (A1(1) \u2212 \u03c71 A2(1) ) ,\n2\n1\n\u221a (A(1) \u2212 \u03c72 A1(1) + (\u03c71 \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c73 )A2(1) ) .\n3\n\nIn the following, we use both the matrices M and N to extract the transformed fields.\n\n(3.38)\n\n\f14\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\nAt this point one would like to understand certain general features (such as the number of\ncommuting Killing symmetries, BPS nature, etc) of the solutions generated using the group action\n(3.32). In appendix B we show, for a general finite dimensional coset model, that under a group\ntransformation the transformed solution and the seed solution must have the same number of commuting Killing symmetries. The question of how the BPS nature of solutions changes under group\ntransformations in three dimensional Euclidean gravity coupled to a coset model is subtle. For many\ncases of interest the subgroup K\u0303 is non-compact, and, as a result, the Iwasawa decomposition does\nnot cover the whole group G. In [39] it is noted that elements of G that cannot be decomposed\ninto the Iwasawa form map non-BPS solutions to BPS solutions. In this paper we do not deal with\nany of these subtleties. We exclusively work with elements of G2 that can be decomposed in the\nIwasawa form (with non-compact K\u0303), and we restrict our attention only to non-BPS solutions. A\nstudy of how the BPS nature of solutions changes under G2 transformations is left for the future.\n\n4\n\nAction of the Cartan and nilpotent subalgebras on general\nsolutions\n\nIn the following, we study separately the action of the Cartan, nilpotent, and k\u0303 subalgebras. The\nactions of the Cartan and nilpotent subalgebras are simple enough that they can be studied on a\ngeneral set of scalar fields \u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c71 , . . . , \u03c76 , for any type of reduction. The action of the k\u0303 subalgebra\nis more involved. It is analyzed on a particular seed solution in the next section.\n\n4.1\n\nCartan subalgebra\n\nUnder the action of a general element of the Cartan subalgebra a1 h1 + a2 h2 , that is, acting on M\nwith g = ea1 h1 +a2 h2 in equation (3.32), the scalars transform as\n\u03c6i\n\n\u2192 \u03c6i + Ci (a1 , a2 ) ,\n\n\u03c7j\n\n\u2192 Kj (a1 , a2 )\u03c7j ,\n\n(4.39)\n\nwhere Ci (a1 , a2 ) and Kj (a1 , a2 ) are functions of the transformation parameters only. In other words,\nthis transformation shifts the dilatons and dilates the axions. The constants Ci and Kj are such\nthat the five-dimensional metric and gauge field are modified in the following way,\nds25\n\n\u2192 e\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c61 +\u03c62\n3\n\n+\u01eb1 e\n\na2 ds23 + \u01eb2 e\n\n\u2212 \u221a23 \u03c61\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62\n3\n\n(b dz4 + a A2(1) )2 ,\n\n(c dz5 + \u03c71 b dz4 + a A1(1) )2 ,\n\nA5(1) \u2192 a A(1) + \u03c73 \u2227 b dz4 + \u03c72 \u2227 c dz5 ,\n\n(4.40)\n\n(4.41)\n\nwhere a, b and c are also functions of the parameters a1 and a2 alone. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe transformation by a general element of the Cartan subalgebra is equivalent to doing the following\n\n\f15\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\nscalings\nds23\nA1(1) , A2(1) , A(1)\n\n\u2192 a2 ds23 ,\n\u2192 a A1(1) , a A2(1) , a A(1) ,\n\nz4\n\n\u2192 b z4 ,\n\nz5\n\n\u2192 c z5 .\n\n(4.42)\n\nIn working with rotational Killing fields this transformation generically generates conical singularities, and, as a result, does not always preserve the asymptotic structure of the seed spacetime.\n\n4.2\n\nNilpotent subalgebra\n\nUnder the action of a general six parameter element b1 e1 + * * * + b6 e6 of the nilpotent subalgebra of\ng2 , the dilatons are unchanged but the axions mix among each other. The mixing is such that the\n\n1\n2\ncombinations of scalars appearing in the expressions for F(1) , F(1)\n, F(1)\nand in equations (3.20) for\n\nG(1)4 , G(1)5 and G(1)6 are unchanged. The first three axions transform as\n\u03c71\n\n\u2192 \u03c71 + b 1 ,\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u2192 \u03c72 \u2212 b 2 ,\n\n\u03c73\n\n\u2192 \u03c73 + b 1 \u03c72 \u2212\n\nb1 b2\n+ b3 ,\n2\n\n(4.43)\n\n1\n2\nand it can be easily verified that this leaves F(1) , F(1)\n, and F(1)\nunchanged. The last three axions\n\ntransform in a more complicated way, involving non-linear terms, but again it can be verified that\n\nG(1)4 , G(1)5 , and G(1)6 are left unchanged. As a consequence, the action of the nilpotent subalgebra\nis just a (possibly large5 ) gauge transformation.\n\nAction of sl(2, R) \u2295 sl(2, R) on black strings\n\n5\n\nWe now turn to the action of the subalgebra k\u0303. We only consider the case \u01eb1 = \u22121, \u01eb2 = +1. As in\n\nthe example of four dimensional general relativity of section 2, the subalgebra k\u0303 generically generates\ncharges that a seed solution does not carry. This is in contrast with the action of the Cartan and\nnilpotent subagebras that do not generate non-trivial charges. In appendix B we show that under\na general G2 transformation the transformed solution and the seed solution must have the same\nnumber of commuting Killing symmetries. These transformations can however alter the asymptotic\nstructure of the spacetime. Nevertheless, by studying the way the matrix M transforms, we show\nin appendix C that all the generators of k\u0303 preserve the Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. This suggests\n\nthat the action of k\u0303 on black strings is very rich. In this section we study in detail its action on a\nparticular seed solution, namely, the five dimensional Kerr string.\nThe four dimensional Kerr metric is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u2206\ndr\n+ d\u03b82 + (1 \u2212 x2 )d\u03c62 ,\nds2 = \u2212f (dt + \u03c9d\u03c6)2 + \u03a3\n\u2206\nf\n5 In\n\n(5.44)\n\nthe present context, a gauge transformation is called large if it acts non trivially on the asymptotic behavior.\n\n\f16\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\nwhere the metric functions are\n\u03a3 = r2 + a2 x2 ,\n\nf =1\u2212\n\n2mr\n,\n\u03a3\n\n\u03c9=\n\n2mr\na(1 \u2212 x2 )\n\u03a3 \u2212 2mr\n\n\u2206 = r2 \u2212 2mr + a2 .\n\n(5.45)\n\nFor calculational convenience we use x = cos \u03b8 as one of the coordinates, instead of the polar\ncoordinate \u03b8. The variable x lies in the range \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1. For later use we also define the base\n\nmetric as\n\nds2base\n\n=\u03a3\n\n\u0012\n\ndr2\n+ d\u03b82\n\u2206\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\n\u2206\n(1 \u2212 x2 )d\u03c62 .\nf\n\n(5.46)\n\nBy adding a flat direction to the four dimensional Kerr solution we obtain the five dimensional Kerr\nstring. Using the subgroup K\u0303 we generalize the metric of the Kerr string in a number of ways.\n\n5.1\n\nk1 : boost\n\nWith the choice of generator \u03c3 k1 , the action on the Kerr string is simply a boost along the string\ndirection\nt \u2192 t cosh \u03c3 \u2212 z sinh \u03c3 ,\n\n5.2\n\nz \u2192 \u2212t sinh \u03c3 + z cosh \u03c3 .\n\n(5.47)\n\nk2 : electric charge\n\n\u221a\nActing with the generator + 3 \u03b1e k2 , the Kerr string gets transformed into a non-extremal spinning\nelectric string solution.

The brane configuration is indicated in the following table\nt\n\nz1\n\nz2\n\nz3\n\nz4\n\nz5\n\nz6\n\nz\n\nM2 \u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nM2 \u00d7\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2212\n\nM2 \u00d7\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nr\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2212\n\n(5.55)\n\nThe spinning solution (5.48) thus naturally represents the spinning variant of this brane configuration\nwith equal M2 charges. The spinning solution with three unequal charges was recently obtained in\n[32] using boosts and string dualities. Upon setting the three charges equal, the electric solution of\n[32] reduces to (5.48)6 .\nWe now provide an analysis of physical properties of the boosted generalization of the spinning\nelectric string (5.48). We study the boosted string configuration because after bending it into a\ncircle and for a specific value of the boost parameter (see equation (5.72) below), it should give a\ndoubly spinning electrically charged black ring. The boosted string configuration can be obtained\nby performing a boost (5.47) with the boost parameter \u03c3 on (5.48). We take the new boosted z\ncoordinate to be along an S 1 with circumference 2\u03c0R, which allows us to write z in terms of an\nangular coordinate \u03c8 defined by\n\u03c8=\n\nz\n,\nR\n\n0 \u2264 \u03c8 < 2\u03c0.\n\n(5.56)\n\nBelow we use z and \u03c8 interchangeably.\nIt is easy to see that the solution (5.48) (as well as the boosted solution) has a regular outer\n\u221a\nhorizon at r = r+ := m + m2 \u2212 a2 of topology R \u00d7 S 2 . In addition there is an inner horizon at\n\u221a\nr = r\u2212 := m \u2212 m2 \u2212 a2 . The two horizons coincide when a = m, which defines the extremal limit.\nThe ADM stress tensor (see e.g., section 2.1 of [42]) of the boosted string is\nTtt\n\n=\n\nTzz\n\n=\n\nTtz\n\n=\n\n\u0001\nm\ncosh2 \u03c3 + 1 + 3s2 cosh2 \u03c3 ,\n2\n\u0001\nm\nsinh2 \u03c3 \u2212 1 + 3s2 sinh2 \u03c3 ,\n2\nm\n(1 + 3s2 ) sinh \u03c3 cosh \u03c3 ,\n2\n\n(5.57)\n\nwhere Ttt and Ttz are the energy and linear momentum density and Tzz is the pressure density of\nthe black string.

The k2 action generically generates the five dimensional electric charge, i.e.,\nfrom the eleven dimensional perspective k2 adds three equally charged M2 branes. It is therefore\nexpected that its action on the doubly spinning Myers-Perry black hole would give rise to the charged\nrotating non-BPS black hole [47] of five dimensional minimal supergravity. This expectation is indeed\nrealized. A detailed calculation using G2 dualities is already presented in [21]. We refer the reader\nto this reference for further details.\nThe k2 action on black rings is more interesting and more subtle. Recall that the most general\nnon-supersymmetric black rings known so far in minimal supergravity is a three parameter family\nthat has electric charge, dipole charge, two unequal angular momenta, and finite energy above\nthe BPS bound [14]7 . This family has only three independent conserved charges, namely, mass,\nelectric charge, and angular momentum in the ring direction. The dipole charge and the angular\nmomentum on the 2-sphere are not independent parameters. This family was constructed by adding\nthree M2 brane charges using boosts and string dualities on the five dimensional dipole black rings\nof [10]. Using G2 dualities we reproduce this calculation by applying k2 on dipole rings of minimal\nsupergravity.\nUnfortunately, these solutions do not admit any non-trivial supersymmetric limit to the BPS\nblack ring. A five parameter family of solutions, characterized by mass, two independent angular\nmomenta, electric charge, and dipole charge is conjectured to exist [14]. This family would allow\nto describe thermal excitations above the BPS solution of [11]. It is also argued that this family\nwould exhibit continuous non-uniqueness through the dipole charge. In spite of attempts since early\non, exact solutions describing such a family remain elusive. It is natural to ask whether one can\nconstruct this family using G2 dualities.\nA significant step forward would be to obtain a smooth doubly spinning electrically charged\nblack ring solution. One might expect that by applying k2 on Pomeransky Sen'kov solution [15]\none would generate such a configuration. However, this expectation is not realized. As is carefully\nexplained in [21], the final solution one gets suffers from Dirac-Misner string singularities. In fact,\nsuch Dirac-Misner strings are expected to arise in working with black rings. The reason is as follows:\none can view the k2 action as an efficient way of doing a sequence of boosts and string-dualities8 to\ngenerate three M2 brane charges and eventually setting these charges equal. It is well known in the\nblack ring literature [48] that one cannot add three independent charges to an otherwise neutral ring\nby applying boosts and string dualities. In a certain duality frame, adding the third charge requires\napplying a boost along the KK direction of a KK-monopole. Such a boost is incompatible with the\nidentifications imposed on the geometry by the KK-monopole fibration. Consequently, one ends up\ngenerating Dirac-Misner strings.\nThis difficulty also arises in the construction of [14]. There it is sidestepped by starting with\n7 The\n\nPomeransky Sen'kov solutions [15] form another three parameter family of non-supersymmetric black rings\n\nin minimal supergravity.\n8 The action of k on black strings, black holes, and black rings naturally suggests such an interpretation, never2\ntheless we do not have a precise argument to support this claim. This point deserves further contemplation.\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n20\n\na seed solution that has an extra parameter (dipole charge), which can be tuned so that the final\nsolution is free from Dirac-Misner strings. Such an extra parameter is not yet available for the\ndoubly spinning solution. It was argued in [21] that, in principle, using G2 dualities it should be\npossible to generate a six parameter unbalanced black ring, which should lead to a four parameter\nnon-singular electrically charged black ring.\nIn the absence of the exact ring solution, one can adopt the blackfold point of view [49, 50, 51, 52]\n(see also [53]), and consider perturbing the straight boosted black string so as to bend it into a\ncircle of very large radius. Perturbative construction of black rings is technically challenging in\nthe presence of gauge fields and internal rotations9 . Furthermore, in our case, it is not guaranteed\nat the outset, that Dirac-Misner strings will not be generated in bending the pressureless boosted\nelectrically charged black string. We will not dwell here on any of the details of such a construction.\nWe simply study a boosted version of the electric string (5.48) as a toy model for a thin doubly\nspinning electrically charged black ring. The motivation behind such a study comes from the fact\nthat all known smooth black rings with charges [11, 55] and with dipoles [10] also become pressureless\nstrings in the infinite radius limit.\nThe connection between boosted black strings and black rings was first made explicit in [48].\nThe infinite radius limit corresponds to taking the ring radius much larger than the ring thickness,\nand focusing on the region near the ring. The absence of pressure in this limit reflects the delicate\nbalance of gravitational tension10 , electromagnetic interactions, and centrifugal repulsion that the\nbalanced ring represents. In our case the pressureless condition (Tzz = 0) translates into a specific\nvalue for the boost parameter\n\n1\n.\n(5.72)\n1 + 3s2\nNote that when s =\n6 0 the boost is smaller than in the neutral case. This observation is easily\nsinh2 \u03c3 =\n\ninterpreted by noting that sections of the ring at diametrically opposite ends, \u03c8 and \u03c8 + \u03c0, have\n\nelectric charges of the same sign and therefore they repel each other via the 2-form field strength F\u03bc\u03bd .\nAs a result, a smaller centrifugal repulsion is needed in order to achieve the mechanical equilibrium.\nSubstituting (5.72) in equations (5.58)\u2013(5.63), one can extract certain important information about\nthe balanced doubly spinning electrically charged black ring.\nAt this point it is useful to understand the relationship between the infinite radius limit of the\nsingular black ring of [21] and our electric string. Simply taking the infinite radius limit of the\nsolution of [21] does not yield our pressureless electric string. The limit corresponds to\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2k\n2m\na2\ny\u2192\u2212\n, and \u03bb \u2192\n.\n(5.73)\nk\u2192\u221e,\n\u03bd\u2192 2 ,\n2k\nr\nk\n\u221a\nThe factors of 2 are necessary in order to get the standard normalization of the final coordinates\nin the electric charge going to zero limit. We find that the electric string obtained from [21] black\nring in this limit is pathological.\n9 To\n\na large extent the considerations of [49, 50, 51, 52] are restricted to neutral singly spinning black rings possibly\n\nin an external gravitational potential. The blackfold methodology is currently being developed for charged branes\n[54].\n10 The gravitational attractive force appears only at a subleading order in the inverse radius [56].\n\n\f21\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n5.3\n\nk3 : generates nothing\n\nk3 does not do anything on the Schwarzschild string, Kerr string, and NUT string.

The spinning solution with three unequal charges was recently\nobtained in [32] using boosts and string dualities. Upon setting the three charges equal, the magnetic\nsolution of [32] reduces to (5.74)\n\n11\n\n.\n\nWe now provide an analysis of physical properties of the boosted generalization of the spinning\nmagnetic string (5.74). We study the boosted string configuration because after bending it into a\ncircle and for a specific value of the boost parameter (see equation (5.107) below), it should give a\ndoubly spinning dipole black ring. The boosted string configuration can be obtained by performing\na boost (5.47) with the boost parameter \u03c3 on (5.74). We take the new boosted z coordinate to be\nalong an S 1 with circumference 2\u03c0R, which allows us to write z in terms of an angular coordinate\n\u03c8 defined in (5.56). Below we use z and \u03c8 interchangeably.\nIt is easy to see that the magnetic solution (as well as its boosted sibling) also has a regular\n\u221a\nouter horizon at r = r+ := m + m2 \u2212 a2 of topology R \u00d7 S 2 . In addition there is an inner horizon\n\u221a\nat r = r\u2212 := m \u2212 m2 \u2212 a2 .

This boosted\nnon-spinning one-brane describes the infinite radius limit of the singly spinning dipole ring of [10].\nA somewhat laborious calculation using these results then shows that the boosted black string\nsatisfies the Smarr relation\nM=\n\n3\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nTH AH + \u03a9\u03c6 J\u03c6 + \u03a9\u03c8 J\u03c8\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n1\n+ T (2\u03c0R) + \u03a6M QM ,\n2\n2\n\n(5.104)\n\nand the first law\ndM =\n\n1\nTH dAH + \u03a9\u03c8 dJ\u03c8 + \u03a9\u03c6 dJ\u03c6 + \u03a6M dQM + 2\u03c0T dR ,\n4\n\n(5.105)\n\nwhere we have introduced the 'angular' velocity and 'angular' momentum\n\u03a9\u03c8 =\n\nvz\n,\nR\n\nJ\u03c8 = Pz R.\n\n(5.106)\n\nFor the pressureless solution (Tzz = 0) the first law is exactly that of [58]. This hints to the possibility\nthat the pressureless black string correctly describes the infinite radius limit of a five dimensional\nasymptotically flat black ring. When the magnetic charge and the internal spin are zero, the Smarr\nrelation and the first law become exactly those of [45].\nAs also mentioned above, bending a boosted version of the magnetic string (5.74) into a circle\nshould give a doubly spinning dipole black ring. An exact solution describing such a ring configuration is not known in the literature. It is likely that the exact ring solution could be obtained\nby applying Yazadjiev solution generating technique [59, 60] to Pomeransky Sen'kov solution [15].\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, such a construction has not yet been attempted. The Yazadjiev technique requires reducing the five dimensional theory to two dimensions; and therefore, in the\ncase of five dimensional supergravity, would require to work with the affine extension of the G2 Lie\nalgebra.\nAt any rate, motivated by considerations of [53, 49, 50, 51, 52], here we simply study the boosted\nspinning magnetic string as a toy model for a thin doubly spinning dipole black ring. We start by\nnoting that the stress tensor (5.84) is identical to the one presented in [10], i.e., the internal spin\ndoes not enter in these components of the stress tensor. Hence, the pressureless condition translates\ninto the same specific value for the boost parameter as in [10]\nsinh2 \u03c3 = 1 + 3s2 .\n\n(5.107)\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n25\n\nWhen s 6= 0 the boost is larger than in the neutral case. This observation is easily interpreted\n\n[10] by noting that sections of the ring at diametrically opposite ends, \u03c8 and \u03c8 + \u03c0, have opposite\norientations and therefore they attract each other via the 2-form field strength F\u03bc\u03bd . As a result, a\n\nlarger centrifugal repulsion is needed in order to achieve the mechanical equilibrium. It is interesting\nto contrast this situation with the electric solution described above \u2013 for the electric solution a\nsmaller centrifugal repulsion is needed, as in that case the opposite ends on the ring repel each\nother. Substituting (5.107) in equations (5.85)\u2013(5.96) and (5.102), one can extract certain important\ninformation about the balanced doubly spinning dipole black ring.\n\n5.5\n\nk5 : NUT charge\n\nActing with the choice of generator + 21 \u03b1 k5 on the Kerr string one gets the Kerr-Taub-NUT string.\nUpon performing the following coordinate and parameter changes r \u2192 m + r \u2212 m cos \u03b1, M =\nm cos \u03b1, N = m sin \u03b1, the final metric is in the standard Boyer-Lindquist coordinates.\n\n5.6\n\nk6 : KK monopole\n\nApplying + 21 \u03b1 k6 on the Kerr string one gets the spinning thermally excited KK-monopole solution\nof [61, 62].\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have explored the G2 solution generating technique for five dimensional minimal\nsupergravity. This technique requires reducing the theory on two commuting Killing directions.\nUpon dimensional reduction, the bosonic equations of motion reduce to those of three dimensional\ngravity coupled to a non-linear sigma model. When the reduction is performed over two spacelike\nKilling directions one obtains the G2 /SO(4) coset model. On the other hand, when the reduction\nis performed over one timelike and one spacelike Killing direction one obtains the G2 /(SL(2, R) \u00d7\n\nSL(2, R)) coset model. In section 3.2 we reviewed this dimensional reduction, treating both cases\n\nsimultaneously.\nThe G2 symmetries of the coset model can be used to construct new solutions by applying\ngroup transformations on seed solutions. In section 4 we considered the action of the Cartan and\nN+ subgroups of G2 on a general seed solution and showed that they act as scaling and gauge\ntransformations respectively. Most interesting is the non-linear action of the subgroup SL(2, R) \u00d7\n\nSL(2, R). Its action on a general seed solution is very complicated and not illuminating, so we\n\nconsidered its action only on a particular seed solution, namely, on the five dimensional Kerr string.\nWe expect that the six generators of SL(2, R)\u00d7 SL(2, R) charge a general seed solution with KaluzaKlein asymptotics in essentially the same way as they charge the Kerr string. Their action on the\nKerr string is given in Table 1. The action of the appropriate pseudo-compact group, in particular,\nhow it rotates charges of BPS black holes, for a closely related N = 2 d = 4 supergravity theory is\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n26\n\ncurrently under investigation [63].\nk1\n\nboost\n\nk2\n\nelectric charge\n\nk3\n\ngenerates nothing\n\nk4\n\nmagnetic charge\n\nk5\n\nNUT charge\n\nk6\n\nKK monopole\n\nTable 1: Action of the SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) subgroup of G2 on the five dimensional Kerr string.\nWe expect that in any coset model the decomposition of symmetry generators into Cartan,\nnilpotent and (pseudo-)compact generators plays a similar role as it does in the G2 coset model.\nMore precisely, we predict that in any coset model obtained via dimensional reduction, e.g., the\nE(8)/K(E(8)) model of eleven dimensional supergravity, all generators belonging to the Cartan and\nnilpotent subgroups act as scaling and gauge transformations, while the compact or pseudo-compact\nsubgroup act as charging transformations.\nUsing the SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) action we obtained a spinning electric and a spinning magnetic\n\nblack string. These solutions were also recently obtained in string theory in reference [32]. Our\nmethod is more efficient compared to [32] in obtaining these solutions in minimal supergravity. We\nanalyzed physical properties of these black strings and studied their thermodynamics. We also\nexplored their relation to black rings.\nThanks to the efficiency of the G2 method, the black string describing the infinite radius limit\nof the conjectured most general black ring of five dimensional minimal supergravity can also be\nconstructed. Here we give a brief outline of how this construction proceeds. Let us start by recalling\nthat such a black string (without imposing the pressureless condition) must have five independent\nparameters: mass, internal spin, boost, smeared electric charge, and magnetic one-brane charge. At\nfirst sight, one might hope that by the successive action of k2 and k4 on the Kerr string one would\ngenerate a four parameter dyonic black string. However, in doing so one also generates a Lorentzian\nNUT charge and hence Dirac-Misner strings singularities12 . To get around this difficulty, one might\nstart with a seed solution that already has a NUT parameter, viz., the Kerr-Taub-NUT string, with\nthe hope that by tuning the extra initial parameter one will be able to cancel the final NUT charge.\nIt turns out that even doing this is not sufficient! One can indeed cancel the NUT charge, but, in the\nprocess of successively applying k2 and k4 on the Kerr Taub-NUT string one also generates a KK\nmonopole charge. To cancel the KK monopole charge one needs to apply another G2 transformation,\nk6 , that adds another parameter. Appropriately tuning this and the initial NUT parameter one gets\na smooth dyonic string. Finally, applying a boost, one generates the requisite five parameter black\nstring. The solution and its physical properties will be presented in a separate publication [33].\n12 In\n\nfact, viewing the k2 and k4 actions as efficient ways of doing sequences of boosts and string dualities, such\n\nDirac-Misner strings are expected to arise [48, 14].\n\n\fG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\n27\n\nA natural continuation of this work is to extend our analysis to black rings and to solutions\nwith more general horizon topologies. A step in this direction was taken in [21] where the authors\nconsidered the action of k2 on the Pomeransky Sen'kov solution [15]. A four parameter electrically\ncharged solution was constructed, but it suffers from Dirac-Misner string singularities. It was argued in [21] that, in principle, using G2 dualities it should be possible to generate a six parameter\nunbalanced black ring, which should lead to a four parameter non-singular black ring [64].\nAn even farther reaching generalization consists in reducing the G2 sigma model on one more\nKilling direction. This would allow one to act with the affine extension of G2 , G+\n2 , on solutions of five\ndimensional minimal supergravity. This line of investigation has been extensively explored in recent\nyears for the gravitational sub-sector of this theory, i.e., for five dimensional vacuum gravity. It has\nled to a great recent progress in our understanding of stationary black holes with two rotational\nKilling vectors (see [13] for a review). The main reason for this success is that after reduction to two\ndimensions, vacuum five dimensional gravity is completely integrable. As a result, powerful solution\ngenerating techniques are available. It is expected that the full minimal supergravity reduced on\nthree commuting Killing vectors also leads to a completely integrable sigma model. If this is the\ncase, then acting with G+\n2 might lead a way to a complete classification of stationary axisymmetric\nsolutions of this theory.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Marc Henneaux for suggesting this project and for comments on a draft.

Suppose\nthat the seed solution admits N \u2265 2 commuting Killing symmetries: \u03c7a , a = 1, . . . , N . Therefore,\nL\u03c7a g\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and L\u03c7a A\u03bc = d\u01eba\nfor some gauge parameters \u01eba . When we dimensionally reduce along the orbits of two Killing vectors,\nthe three dimensional metric and the scalar fields are all invariant under the action of \u03c7a 's. Indeed,\none can choose locally N coordinates on the spacetime to be \u03c7\u0302a such that \u03c7a =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u03c7\u0302a .\n\nThe fields g\u03bc\u03bd\n\nand A\u03bc then do not depend on \u03c7\u0302a and from the definitions (3.15)-(3.16)-(3.20) we immediately see\nthat all the three dimensional fields also do not depend on \u03c7\u0302a 's.\n\n\f29\n\nG2 Dualities in D = 5 Supergravity and Black Strings\n\nThe new scalar fields obtained from an action of G2 are then also invariant under \u03c7a 's, because\nthey are constructed from certain (non-linear) combinations of the original fields. The dual gauge\nfields obtained after integrations, in (3.20) or (3.36), are also invariant under \u03c7a 's possibly up to\ngauge transformations. Indeed, we have L\u03c7a (\u22c6M\u22121 dM) = L\u03c7a (dN ) = 0 by hypothesis. Therefore,\n\nd(L\u03c7a N ) = 0 and so L\u03c7a N = d\u01eb. The result then follows from the definition of the dual gauge\n\nfields.\n\nAs a duality transformation admits an inverse, we have shown that solutions related by dualities\nalways have the same amount of commuting Killing symmetries. This precludes the use of the G2 ,\nor for that matter any finite dimensional hidden symmetries, to generate solutions with less number\nof commuting Killing symmetries than the ones that are already known.\n\nC\n\nAsymptotic analysis\n\nIt is important to note that in general the asymptotic structure of the seed spacetime is not preserved by transformations generated by coset symmetries. This appendix is devoted to analyze the\ngenerators of G2 that preserve asymptotic flatness and Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. See also [22, 64].\n\nC.1\n\nAsymptotic flatness\n\nWe follow Giusto and Saxena [26] to find generators that preserve five dimensional asymptotic flatness by focusing on the asymptotic limit of the symmetric form 13 M\u0303 of the matrix M. For Minkowski\nspacetime we denote the matrix M\u0303 by M\u0303R1,4 . To find the generators preserving asymptotic flatness\n\nwe use the simple criteria of [26] that asymptotically the matrix M\u0303 for a general spacetime should\napproach the asymptotic limit M\u0303\u221e\nR1,4 of flat space matrix M\u0303R1,4 . This criteria is not sufficient to\n\ndiscard certain pathological spacetimes that approach flat space at the boundary only locally.\n\nIn order to get the matrix M\u0303R1,4 , one should, as in the pure gravitational case [26], compactify\n\nMinkowski space on two Killing vectors. Following [26] we do this in the spherical polar coordinates\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + dr2 + r2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 + cos2 \u03b8d\u03c8 2\n\n\u0001\n\n(C.108)\n\nwith the choice\n\n13 Reference\n\nz4\n\n=\n\nl(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\nz5\n\n=\n\nt.\n\nor z4 = l (\u03c6 + \u03c8)\n\n(C.109)\n(C.110)\n\n[26] uses a construction based on the matrix M\u0303 defined as M\u0303 := V T \u03b7V where \u03b7 is a matrix invariant\n\nunder SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R). The coset Lagrangian in terms of the matrix M\u0303 is again given by the expression (3.34),\nthat is, Lcoset =\n\n1\nTr(dM\u0303\u22121 dM\u0303).\n8\n\nThe matrix M\u0303 transforms as M\u0303 \u2192 g T M\u0303g when V \u2192 kVg. Moreover, the\n\nmatrix \u03b7 allows to pass from the transposition to the generalized transposition via g t = \u03b7g \u266f \u03b7\u22121 .

From this form it immediately follows that the isotropy group of M\u0303\u221e\nR1,4\n\nis contained in SO(3, 4). The generators of G2 that belongs to the isotropy group are the following,\nh2 , e3 + e4 , e1 + e5 , k2 , 2e3 \u2212 k3 + k4 , \u22122e1 + k1 \u2212 k5 .\n\n(C.111)\n\nThe three gravitational generators h2 , e1 +e5 and \u22122e1 +k1 \u2212k5 correctly reproduce the commutation\nrelations of the expected SO(2, 1) found for vacuum five dimensional gravity [26]. In appendix D\n\nwe show how the results of [26] are embedded in our formalism.\n\nC.2\n\nBlack string asymptotics\n\nOne can perform a similar analysis for the Kaluza-Klein asymptotics R3,1 \u00d7 S 1 . It goes along the\n\nsame lines as for the asymptotically flat case. We consider a reduction on time z5 = t and the 'string\ndirection' z4 = z. The main result is that the entire pseudo-compact group K\u0303 \u2282 G2 preserves the\n\nKaluza-Klein asymptotics R3,1 \u00d7 S 1 . It is interesting to contrast this with the asymptotically flat\n\ncase where only three combinations out of the six generators of the pseudo-compact algebra preserve\nasymptotic flatness. The action of G2 on black strings is therefore richer than on five dimensional\nblack holes.\n\nD\n\nSL(3, R) \u2282 G2(2) : the gravitational sector\n\nIn this appendix, we compare the dimensional reduction ansatz of [26] with ours. This allows us to\nembed the results of [26] in minimal supergravity.\nWhen the five dimensional gauge field is set to zero, minimal supergravity reduces to vacuum\ngravity. This tells us that the hidden symmetry SL(3, R) of vacuum five dimensional gravity is\n\u223c sl(3, R) is a subalgebra of g2 . It is generated by the elements\npart of G2(2) . Indeed, Hgrav =\n(h1 , h2 , e1 , e5 , e6 , f1 , f5 , f6 ). The simple roots of Hgrav are in one-to-one correspondence with the\n\nscalars obtained from the reduction (3.18) of the gravitational sector of the supergravity Lagrangian.\nIn this appendix we would like to understand how the 3 \u00d7 3 Maison matrix [65] \u03c7, used in [26],\n\nis embedded in our 7 \u00d7 7 matrix M\u0303, defined in appendix C.1.
