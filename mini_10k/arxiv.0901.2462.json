Introduction\nThe analysis of the spectra of light hadrons, observed in ultrarelativistic collisions of\n\u221a\nAu nuclei at a center of mass energy of s = 200 GeV, has revealed that in these\ncollisions a new kind of strongly interacting matter is produced. One of the evidences\nis the observation that the spatial deformation of the overlap zone of projectile and\ntarget, quantified by the eccentricity \u01eb, is converted into an asymmetry in momentum\nspace in azimuthal direction, called elliptic flow v2 =< cos 2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6reaction ) > [3]. The\nexperimental v2 is quantitatively described by ideal hydrodynamics. This means that\nthe viscosity coefficient is small [5, 6]. Even if in the meantime a detailed analysis of\nthe impact parameter dependence of the elliptic flow of different particles has revealed\nthat the situation is a bit more complicated [4] a remarkable and unexpected degree of\nlocal thermalization is obtained in this new kind of matter, the plasma of quarks and\ngluons (QGP).\nThis small viscosity has the unwanted consequence that a local equilibrium among\nthe constituents of the QGP, light quarks and gluons, is maintained until the phase\ntransition. Hence those hadrons which contain only light quarks carry only information\non plasma properties close to the phase transition. Therefore, most of the observed\nparticles are not very useful to obtain the desired information on the creation and time\nevolution of the QGP and one has to concentrate on those few probes which do not\ncome to an equilibrium with the expanding QGP. These probes include photons, jets and\nheavy mesons. The latter are an especially useful probe because a) due to the large mass\nof the heavy quarks the kinematic properties of heavy mesons are close to that of heavy\nquarks before hadronization, b) the initial momentum distribution of heavy quarks can\nbe inferred from pp collisions and is therefore known. Consequently, comparing the pT\n\n\fTomography of the Quark Gluon Plasma by Heavy Quarks\n\n2\n\nspectra of heavy mesons, obtained in heavy ion reactions, with that of pp collisions one\nhas direct access to the momentum change which the heavy quarks suffer while traversing\nthe plasma because the cross section for collisions of the heavy meson after hadronization\nis presumably small. For this purpose one defines RAA = d\u03c3AA /dp2T /(< Nc > d\u03c3pp /dp2T ),\nwhere < Nc > is the average number of initial binary collisions. If heavy quarks do not\nsuffer from an energy loss while traversing the plasma RAA should be \u2248 1 but this is\nnot really true because the transverse momentum of the partons which create the heavy\nquark pair has been modified by the medium. This will be discussed below.\nBecause the mean free path of heavy quarks is shortest at the beginning of the\nexpansion, the deviation of RAA from one encodes dominantly the interaction of the\nheavy quarks with the QGP at the beginning of the expansion. Initially the heavy\nquarks are isotropically distributed in azimuthal direction. They can get elliptic flow\nonly by interactions with the light quarks and gluons. Because it takes time until the\neccentricity is converted into elliptic flow the v2 of the heavy mesons is sensitive to the\ninteraction of the heavy quarks with the plasma at the end of the expansion of the\nplasma.\n2. The Model\nRecently we have advanced a model [1] which studies the creation of heavy quarks in a\nQGP, their interaction with the expanding plasma (described by ideal hydrodynamics)\nand how this interaction modifies the observed spectra of heavy mesons (or more\nprecisely that of single non photonic electrons, the decay products of heavy mesons).\nThe elementary interaction between the heavy quarks and the partons of the plasma,\nlight quarks, q, and gluons, g, is described by pQCD where the density, the temperature\nand the average velocity of the partons is given by the hydrodynamical expansion.\nThe time evolution of the distribution of the heavy quarks can either be calculated\nby a Boltzmann equation or by a Fokker-Planck equation. The results presented here\nare based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation and we use the Fokker Planck\napproach only to calculate drag and diffusion coefficients which can be compared with\nother approaches. The details of the model can be found in ref.[1, 2]. As compared to\nformer approaches our approach differs in two respects:\n\u2022 We employ a running nonperturbative coupling constant whose value remains finite\nat t \u2192 0 [8].\n\n\u2022 We use an infrared regulator in the t-channel which is determined by hard thermal\nloop calculations, as done by Braaten and Thoma [9] in the case of QED. The\ndetails of how to extend their approach to QCD is found in the appendix of ref. [1].\n\nBoth these new ingredients enhance the elastic cross section in the qQ \u2192 qQ as well\nas in the gQ \u2192 gQ channel. This can be seen in fig. 1 which shows the total elastic cross\nsection of a c-quark with an energy of 10 GeV which traverses a T = 400 MeV plasma,\nleft for the collisions with light quarks, right for the collisions with gluons for different\nassumptions on the coupling constant and the infrared regulator. We see that the lower\n\n\f3\n\nTomography of the Quark Gluon Plasma by Heavy Quarks\n\ninfrared regulator as well as the running coupling constant increase the cross section at\nlow t as compared to the one with the standard choices \u03b1(2\u03c0T ) and \u03bc = mD , where mD\nis the Debye mass. Other approaches use a temperature independent coupling constant\nand/or \u03bc = kmD where k varies between 0.3 and 1.\nd\u03a3cq\u00aecq\ndt\n\nd\u03a3cg\u00aecg\n\nHarb. unitsL\n\ndt\n\u0391H2\u03a0TL, \u039c2= m2DHTL\nHstandardL\n\u0391H2\u03a0TL, \u039c2=0.15m2DHTL\nHmodel CL\n\u008e2\n\u0391eff HtL, \u039c2=0.2mDHTL\nHmodel EL\n\n107\n106\n105\n104\n\n106\n105\n104\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u00c8t\u00c8 HGeV2L\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u0391H2\u03a0TL, \u039c2= m2DHTL\nHstandardL\n\u0391H2\u03a0TL, \u039c2=0.15m2DHTL\nHmodel CL\n\u008e2\n\u0391eff HtL, \u039c2=0.2mDHTL\nHmodel EL\n\n107\n\nEc=10GeV\nT=0.4GeV\n1\n\nHarb. unitsL\n\nEc=10GeV\nT=0.4GeV\n1\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u00c8t\u00c8 HGeV2L\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 1.

We introduce\ntherefore a K-factor, i.e. a multiplication factor which is applied to the cross section.\nWith a running coupling constant and a infrared regulator of \u03bc = 0.2mD , dubbed \"model\nE\" in ref. [1] and shown as the thick (red) line in fig. 1, a K-factor of 1.8 describes the\ncentral as well as the minimum bias data for RAA and v2 published by the STAR [10]\nand the Phenix [11] collaboration, see ref.[1].\nIn order to compare our model with other approaches we calculate the diffusion\nconstant in space, DS =< x2 (t) > /6t, which is related to the drag coefficient \u03b7D by\nDS = T /(MQ \u03b7D ) [14]. The drag coefficient can be connected to the ratio of viscosity and\nentropy density, \u03b7/s, one of the key quantities of the present discussion. The relation\nis, however, different in the different models and ranges from \u03b7/s = DS T /6 [14] to\n\u03b7/s = DS T /2 in the AdS/CFT approach. Fig. 2 displays this quantity for b and c\n-quarks as a function of the plasma temperature.

Centrality dependence\nIn ref.[1] we have compared our results with central and minimum bias data. As\ndiscussed in [2] the interaction between the heavy quarks and the plasma is a\nquite complicated process in which the spatial geometry plays an essential role and\nconsequently the impact parameter (or centrality) dependence of the results is highly\nnon trivial. Therefore, it is useful to exploit the whole selection of centralities provided\nby the Phenix collaboration.\nIf hadrons have scattered before they create a heavy quark pair their transverse\nmomentum distribution is modified. This so called Cronin effect yields a broadening of\n\u2206PT2 = ncoll (~r\u22a5 ) \u03c3 2 , where \u03c3 2 is the broadening of the squared transverse momentum\nin a single NN collision and ncoll is the number of prior collisions. We parameterize\nthis distribution by a Gaussian function with a variance of \u2206PT2 . The consequences\nfor RdAu for different values of \u03c3 2 are shown in fig. 3. For later calculations we use\n\u03c3 2 = 0.2 GeV2 .\nThe result of our approach for the different centrality classes, as compared to the\nPhenix data, is shown in fig.4. We see that for all centralities the general trend is well\nreproduced. For the most peripheral events the Phenix data show an decrease of RAA\nwhich is not reproduced in our approach and known mechanisms do not account for this\nbehavior.\nAnother way to present the data is the centrality dependence of the peT integrated\nRAA defined as\nR\u221e\ndNAuAu /dpT\npmin\nT\nR\n.\n(1)\nRAuAu (pmin\n)\n=\nT\n< Nc > p\u221e\nmin dNpp /dpT\nT\n\nRAuAu (pmin\nT )\n\nIn fig. 5 we present\nas a function of the participant number, Npart , and\nfor 2 different lower bounds of the integration, pmin\nT , in comparison with the results\nof the Phenix collaboration [11]. Because all heavy quarks are finally converted into\nheavy hadrons this presentation allows to study directly the average jet quenching as a\nfunction of the centrality of the reaction. Also these results are in good agreement with\nthe data.\n\n\f5\n\nTomography of the Quark Gluon Plasma by Heavy Quarks\nRAA lept\n1.5\n\nRAA lept\n1.5\n\nAu-Au central; \u00ae\u0395trans min\n\nAu-Au 10-20%; \u00ae\u0395trans min\n\n\u0391eff HtL; \u039a=0.2; K=1.8\nPHENIX\n\n1.0\n\n\u0391eff HtL; \u039a=0.2; K=1.8\n\nSTAR\n\nPHENIX\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nmodel E\n\nmodel E\n2\n\n4\npT HGeV\u0090cL\n\nRAA lept\n1.5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n2\nRAA lept\n1.5\n\nAu-Au 20-40%; \u00ae\u0395trans min\n\n4\npT HGeV\u0090cL\n\n8\n\nAu-Au 40-60%; \u00ae\u0395trans min\n\n\u0391eff HtL; \u039a=0.2; K=1.8\n\n\u0391eff HtL; \u039a=0.2; K=1.8\n\nPHENIX\n\n1.0\n\n6\n\nPHENIX\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nmodel E\n\nmodel E\n2\n\n4\npT HGeV\u0090cL\n\n6\n\n8\n\n2\n\nRAA lept\n1.5\n\nRAA lept\n1.5\n\n4\npT HGeV\u0090cL\n\n8\n\nAu-Au min. bias; \u00ae\u0395trans min\n\u0391eff HtL; \u039a=0.2; K=1.8\n\nAu-Au 60%-...; \u00ae\u0395trans min\n\u0391eff HtL; \u039a=0.2; K=1.8\n\nPHENIX\n\n1.0\n\nPHENIX\n\n1.0\n\n6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nmodel E\n\nmodel E\n2\n\n4\npT HGeV\u0090cL\n\n6\n\n8\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n6\npT HGeV\u0090cL\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFigure 4.

Comparison with other models\n\nThe theoretical values of the two experimentally measured quantities, RAA and v2 ,\ndepend in a sensitive way on the two conceptually different ingredients of the theory, the\ninteraction of the heavy quarks with the plasma and the expansion of the plasma itself.\nIf one wants to compare different theories it is very helpful to separate both ingredients.\nThis is possible by the definition of transport coefficients which can be calculated in\nevery approach to the heavy quark-plasma interaction. These transport coefficients\ndepend on the interaction of the heavy quark with the plasma but are independent\nof the expansion of the plasma. The most interesting of these coefficients is the drag\n= \u03b7D p of the\ncoefficient, \u03b7D . It describes the time evolution of the mean momentum dp\ndt\nheavy quark [12, 13]. It can be calculated from the microscopic interaction with help\nof eq. 2 of ref. [1] or from classical Langevin type approaches. In some of the models\nit is given as an input variable. Fig. 6 displays \u03b7D for different theoretical approaches,\non the left hand side for c-quarks and on the right hand side for b-quarks. There we\nhave assumed that the heavy quarks interact with a plasma of a temperature of 300\nMeV. For all calculations we use the default values of the coupling constant. M&T\nrefers to Moore and Teaney (eq. B31 with \u03b1S = 0.3) of [14], VH&R to van Hees and\nRapp [15, 16, 17] (with a resonance width of \u0393 = 400 MeV), P&P to Peshier and Peigne\n[18] and AdS/CFT to the drag coefficient calculated in the framework of the anti de\nSitter/ Conformal field theory by Gubser [19, 20].

(Color online) The drag coefficient \u03b7D for c-quarks (left) and b-quarks\n(right) as a function of the quark momentum. The temperature of the scattering\npartners is 300 MeV.\n\nThe largest drag we observe for the AdS/CFT approach. In this theory the drag\ncoefficient is momentum independent. All (p)QCD based drag coefficients decrease\nwith increasing pT and hence with increasing momentum the plasma becomes more\ntransparent. Nevertheless, the pQCD based drag coefficient vary quite substantially\ndue to different assumptions on the cut-offs and due to different ingredients, especially\nthe presence of qQ resonances in the plasma. One may ask the question whether\nsuch difference does not have a consequences on the predictions of experimentally\naccessible quantities. In order to study this question we compare the results of two\ncalculations: those of our model E with those in which the drag coefficient of model E is\nreplaced by that of van Hees and Rapp. The expansion of the plasma, described by the\nhydrodynamical approach of Kolb and Heinz [5], is identical in both calculations. Fig.\n\n\f7\n\nTomography of the Quark Gluon Plasma by Heavy Quarks\n\n7 shows the results. The top panels display RAA as a function of pT for c- and b-quarks,\nleft (right) without (with) pT broadening due to the Cronin effect. In our model, which\nagrees with the data, the deviation of RAA from one is twice as large for large pT as if\nwe use the drag coefficient of van Hees and Rapp in an otherwise unchanged model. A\nsimilar observation can be made for v2 , see bottom panel. For the impact parameter\nwhich has been used to simulate minimum bias events, the elliptic flow v2 is reduced by a\nfactor of two if we replace in our model the drag coefficient by that of van Hees and Rapp\nwithout changing the model for the plasma expansion. In their original publication van\nHees and Rapp have described the data quite well. It is therefore interesting to explore\nwhether the different models for the expansion of the plasma are at the origin of the\ndifference. If this were the case it would stress another time the fact that the description\nof the experimental RAA and v2 spectra is a double challenge: that to describe the Qq\nand Qg interactions and that to describe the expansion of the plasma. If this were not\nthe case, the heavy quarks would not tell us something about the plasma properties\nduring the expansion.\n\nRAAHQ L\n\nRAAHQ L\n2.0\n\nAu + Au ; b= 7 fm\n-> \u0395\n\nNo p\n\nT\n\ntrans min\n\n2.0 Au + Au ; b= 7 fm\n\nbroadening\n\n1.5\n\np\n\n-> \u0395\n\ntrans min\n\nmod E H\u0391s run.L, K=1.8\n\n1.5\n\nreso.
