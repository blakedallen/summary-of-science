Simulations over the last years strongly support this picture (for a review see\n[1]). It is conjectured that at large distances R the dynamics of the flux tube is governed\nby an effective string theory, describing the properties of strong interactions in the infrared\nlimit. The construction of models for these QCD strings in terms of open bosonic string\ntheories have been attempted for a long time [2]. Today there are two different possible\napproaches for consistent effective string theories. The first idea, due to Polchinski and\nStrominger [3], was to construct an action consisting of all terms invariant under conformal\ntransformations that avoids the conformal anomaly in an arbitrary number of dimensions.\nThe first analysis of the closed string spectrum to O(R\u22121 ) was extended up to and including\nO(R\u22125 ) in [4\u201312], showing that the spectrum is equivalent to the spectrum of Nambu-Goto\nstring theory (NG) [13, 14]\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\n1\nNG\nEn (R) = \u03c3 R 1 +\n(d \u2212 2) ,\n(1.1)\nn\u2212\n\u03c3 R2\n24\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fat least to that order.\nThe other approach is due to L\u00fcscher and Weisz [15, 16], using an action consisting\nof all possible terms constructed directly from the transverse degrees of freedom. The\ncorresponding coupling constants are fixed through the duality between open and closed\nstrings wrapping around a spatial dimension, which is valid in the presence of at least\none compactified spatial dimension of length R. Recently their work was extended to\neven higher orders in 1/R and to the open string case [17\u201319], using the SO(1 | d \u2212 1)\nLorentz symmetry to constrain additional coupling constants (see also [20]). Leading order\ncorrections to the closed string spectrum in d > 2 + 1 possibly appear at order O(R\u22125 )\nfor the excited states and at O(R\u22127 ) for the ground state. For the energy spectrum of the\nopen string the picture is different due to boundary terms in the effective action. Indeed\nit turns out that first corrections to all states may already appear at O(R\u22124 ), also for\nd = 2 + 1. In addition, there are possible corrections at O(R\u22125 ) for d > 2 + 1. It is thus\nnatural to look for boundary corrections in the d = 2 + 1 theory, since these are the only\nones contributing up to O(R\u22126 ) at least.\nThe predictions from these effective theories can be tested by comparison to simulations\nof pure Yang-Mills theories and a lot of studies were done using different theories in 2 + 1\nand 3 + 1 dimensions, see [21] and references therein. In this context it is important to\nnote, that liftings of degeneracy in the open string energy levels for d = 3 + 1 in pure\nSU (3) gauge theory where already reported in [22\u201324]. For recent results on the closed\nstring spectrum in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensional SU (N ) gauge theory see [25, 26]. In the\nlast years accurate measurements for the width of the flux tube became feasible as well and\nresults with improved systematics and high accuracy coincide with the NG predictions for\nthis quantity [27, 28].\nIt is an ambitious project to compare the energy spectrum of the flux tube with the\npredictions of the effective model. The stringy behavior is expected to set in at relatively\nlarge distances and the expected deviations from NG energy levels are small. Thus one\nhas to measure a small effect at relatively large energies. In addition one has to control\nsystematic effects as e.g. contributions from excited states and effects coming from finite\nextent of the lattice. Indeed most simulations so far haven't been able to reduce the errors\nand to control the systematic effects sufficiently at the same time. This is especially true\nfor open strings with Dirichlet boundary conditions, corresponding to the excited states of\na flux tube between static quark and antiquark. The corresponding energy spectrum can\nbe explored using Wilson loops, but large temporal extent is needed to ensure a sufficient\nsuppression of contaminations from excited states.\nIn [29, 30] a new method was proposed to measure large loops with high accuracy, based\non the L\u00fcscher-Weisz multilevel algorithm [31], and has been applied to the spectrum of the\nflux tube in three-dimensional SU (2) gauge theory. In this study this method is combined\nwith a variational method to extract excited state energies in a specific (C, P )-channel\nand reduce excited state contaminations as much as possible. This enables us to extract\nthe energy levels accurate enough to compare to the predictions from the effective theory.\nAgain we use SU (2) gauge theory and work in three dimensions, but focus only on one\nlattice spacing at \u03b2 = 5.0 with a relatively large lattice spacing in terms of r0 , the Sommer\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fscale [32]. Simulating three instead of four dimensions is convenient because simulations\nare much faster and 1/R5 corrections to the NG energy levels are absent in the threedimensional theory.\nThe paper is organised as follows: In the next section we begin by summarising the\ncorrections to the Nambu-Goto energy levels and lay the groundwork for the comparison\nto the measurements. In section 3 we turn to the details of the simulations, describe the\nextraction of the excited states and the control of systematic errors. In section 4 we discuss\nour results and compare to the NG predictions. In section 5 we compare to the boundary\ncorrections and finally draw our conclusions in the last section.\n\n2\n\nCorrections to Nambu-Goto from boundary terms\n\nIn this section we discuss the boundary corrections to the energy spectrum of open strings in\nd = 2 + 1. To keep things simple, we only discuss the main points and adopt the notation\nfrom [18, 19]. As shown there, the only additional contribution to NG energy levels to\nO(R\u22125 ) in the effective theory in 2 + 1 dimensions is the contribution of a boundary term,\nleading to the Hamiltonian\n!\n\u221e\n3\nX\n\u03c0\nd\n\u2212\n2\nH2\u2032 = \u2212b2 4 4\n.\n(2.1)\nn2 \u03b1\u2212n \u03b1n +\nR\n60\nn=1\n\nThe states of the Fock space contributing to the three lowest energy levels, denoted by\nEn,i , where n is the energy level in the free theory and i is the index for the degenerate\nstates at that level, are given by:\nenergy\nE0\nE1\nE2,1\nE2,2\n\n| n, ii\n\n| 0i\n| 1i\n| 2, 1i\n| 2, 2i\n\nrepresentation\n\n(C, P )\n\n| 0i\n| 0i\n| 0i\n| 0i\n\n(+, +)\n(+, \u2212)\n(+, +)\n(\u2212, \u2212)\n\n1\n\u03b1\u22121\n\u03b1\u22121 \u03b1\u22121\n\u03b1\u22122\n\nHere P is the parity quantum number of the state and C what we call the quantum number\nof charge conjugation (called transverse and longitudinal parity respectively in [26]). To\nbe precise: C is the exchange between quark and antiquark, combined with a change in\nthe direction of the gluonic flow. Using the commutation relations\n[\u03b1n , \u03b1\u2212n ] = n \u03b4nm\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fit is straightforward to compute the corrections to the NG energies \u01ebn,i of these states due\nto the Hamiltonian (2.1). The corrections are given by:\n\u03c0 3 (d \u2212 2)\nR4 60\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c03\n(d \u2212 2)\n= \u2212b2 4 4 +\nR\n60\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c03\n(d \u2212 2)\n= \u2212b2 4 8 +\nR\n60\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c03\n(d \u2212 2)\n= \u2212b2 4 32 +\nR\n60\n\n\u01eb0 = \u2212b2\n\u01eb1\n\u01eb2,1\n\u01eb2,2\n\n(2.3)\n\nAs we see, already the ground state obtains a O(R\u22124 ) correction from the boundary\nterms, which is nevertheless strongly suppressed by a factor 1/60 and therefore hardly\nvisible in our simulation, except for the unlikely case that b2 is large. Nevertheless it might\nbe visible in high accuracy simulations for the ground state, as e.g. performed in [33, 34].\nThe corrections to the excited states are enhanced by a factor 240 or more compared to the\nground state correction and are therefore much easier to detect, even though it is harder to\nextract these states numerically. In addition the degeneracy of the states at n = 2 in the\nfree theory is lifted and the magnitude of the corrections to the two formerly degenerate\nstates differ by roughly a factor of 4.\nImportant for the comparison between measurements and the predictions is the radius\nof convergence of the expansion of the string energy levels in 1/R, which can be estimated\n\u221a\nby xc = 1/\u03bb, the radius of convergence for the expansion of 1 + \u03bb x around x = 0.\nIn the effective string theory the radius of convergence corresponds to a critical length\np\n\u221a\nRc \u03c3 = 1/xc below which the expansion of the square root ceases to be convergent.\n\u221a\nFor closed strings this critical length is relatively large, Rc \u03c3 & 3.4 for d = 2 + 1, while\nfor the open string we have\nRc\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c3\n\nn=1\n\n= 2.45 ,\n\nRc\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c3\n\nn=2\n\n= 3.51 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nAs can be seen from [30, 35, 36], extracting the energies of a flux tube of this length is\npossible, especially for the first excited state. Nevertheless the coefficient b2 is not known\nab initio and we have to extract it from the data. We discuss the extraction of b2 and the\nresults in section 5.\n\n3\n\nDetails of the simulations\n\nWilson loops are the observables suited to consider the excited states of the flux tube and\nwere already used in [22\u201324] and [29, 30, 35, 36] to extract the spectrum of the excitations.\nIn this study, we combine the use of correlation matrices with the error reduction method\nfrom [29, 30] to extract the excitations spectrum in the (C, P )-channels from large Wilson\nloops and suppress contributions from other excited states as much as possible.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fFigure 1. Sets of operators to construct the correlation matrices in different (C, P ) channels.\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nExtraction of the energy spectrum\nExtraction of eigenvalues\n\nTo extract the energy spectrum we use 8 different operator sets, shown in figure 1. From\nthese sets we first construct (C, P )-projectors, given by the linear combinations (see also\n[30])\nSi++ = Si1 + Si2 + Si3 + Si4\nSi+\u2212 = Si1 + Si2 \u2212 Si3 \u2212 Si4\n(3.1)\nSi\u2212\u2212 = Si1 \u2212 Si2 \u2212 Si3 + Si4\nSi\u2212+ = Si1 \u2212 Si2 + Si3 \u2212 Si4 .\nWith these projectors we construct a correlation matrix in each of the (C, P )-channels.\nTo obtain the energies one has to extract the eigenvalues in the limit T \u2192 \u221e. Extracting these eigenvalues is a delicate topic, since loops with a temporal extent much larger\nthan 3 r0 are out of reach with todays algorithms. In addition the number of operators N\nused to construct correlation matrices is finite, leading to the problem that even though\none has extracted the eigenvalues carefully there might be a remaining mixing with states\nbelonging to other energy levels. Usually one would use a generalised eigenvalue problem\n(GEVP), as discussed e.g. in [37]. The GEVP has the advantage that the excited states\ncontributing to each of the eigenvalues start at n = N + 1 as shown in [38]. In our case it is\nhardly possible to establish this method accurately, since the correlation matrix might be\nill-conditioned even for the smallest values of T . This is especially an issue in the case of\nthe correlation matrices in the (\u2212, \u2212) and (\u2212, +)-channels, where the signal to noise ratio\nof the larger eigenvalues becomes very small. We therefore diagonalise the correlation matrices at each value of T separately to obtain the eigenvalues \u03bbCP\nn (R, T ) with n = 0, . . . , 7,\nusing the QR reduction method (see e.g. [39]) and check explicitly the T dependence of\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fthe overlaps between eigenvalues and operators. This method is analogous to the method\nused in [26], where a variational criterion has been applied at each value of T seperately.\nFor all states discussed in this study there is no significant change in the overlaps in the\nrange of 4 \u2264 T \u2264 12 and we do not expect to see any relicts of this in the data. In contrast\nto the case of the GEVP we now have a remaining mixing with each energy level in the\nchannel, even though the mixing between the smallest eigenvalues should be suppressed if\nwe have chosen the operators wisely. In [25] and [26] this mixing is minimised by using\na very large number of basis states. Increasing the number of operators above a limit of\naround 50 is hardly possible in combination with our error reduction algorithm, since the\nneeded computing ressources grows drastically.\n3.1.2\n\nGroundstate energies in a given channel\n\nIn this study we mainly focus on the ground states of the (C, P )-channels, except for the\nfirst excited state in the (+, +)-channel, which is discussed in the next section. Each of\nthe eigenvalues corresponding to the ground state in a channel now obeys the spectral\nrepresentation\n\u221e\nX\nCP\nCP\n(3.2)\n\u03b2jCP (R) e\u2212Ej (R) T ,\n\u03bb0 (R, T ) =\nj=0\n\nwhere EjCP are the energies in the (C, P )-channel and \u03b2jCP the overlaps with the eigenstate.\nIf the excited states are suppressed sufficiently, we can extract the corresponding energies using the asymptotic behavior\n\u0001\n\u0001\nCP\nCP\n\u2212 ln \u03bbCP\n0 (R, T ) = \u01120 (R) T \u2212 ln \u03b20 (R) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is exact in the limit T \u2192 \u221e. In practice \u01120CP (R) is obtained by fitting the data to\n(3.3) together with the logarithm as an additional fit parameter. These energies are called\nna\u0131\u0308ve from now on, because contaminations from excited states are neglected.\nUnfortunately the simulations have shown that the suppression of the excited states is\nnot sufficient with the loop sizes in reach with the present methods of error reduction. This\nis especially crucial for larger values of R as shown in section 4. It is therefore mandatory to\ntake the corrections into account. This can be done by fitting the eigenvalues for different\ntemporal extents Ta and Tb to the leading order formula (see also [29, 30, 35, 36])\n\u0014 CP\n\u0015\n1\n\u03bb0 (R, Tb )\nCP\n1\n\u2212\nln CP\n\u03b1CP (R) e\u2212\u03b4 (R) Ta\n= E0CP (R) +\nTb \u2212 Ta\nTb \u2212 Ta\n\u03bb0 (R, Ta )\n(3.4)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4\n\nCP (R)\n\n(Tb \u2212Ta )\n\n.\n\nHere Ta < Tb , \u03b1CP (R) = \u03b21CP (R)/\u03b20CP (R) and \u03b4CP (R) is the energy gap to the first\nexcited state in the channel. The energies E0CP (R) are called corrected from now on\nand are obtained as fit parameters together with the \u03b1's and \u03b4's from fits to all possible\ncombinations of Ta and Tb . The control of these fits is discussed in more detail in section\n3.3.2.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f3.1.3\n\nExcited states in a given channel\n\nFor an eigenvalue corresponding to an excited state in a channel the situation is different\ndue to possible mixings with states of smaller energy. The only excited state in a channel\nused in this study is the first excited state in the (+, +)-channel on which we focus in this\nsection. The only state with smaller energy contributing is the corresponding ground state,\nwhose energy E0++ (R) can be extracted with the procedure described above. For the na\u0131\u0308ve\nenergy \u01121++ we can use a fit to the form (3.3), since mixings with other energy levels are\nneglected in this quantity. Nevertheless the extraction of the corrected energy E1++ needs\nsome additional discussion.\nA fit to the form (3.4) removes the contaminations from states with larger energy\nvalues. This remains true for excited states in a channel, but one has to include also the\ncorrections coming from states with smaller energy. For the state E1++ we can check the\ncontribution of the state E0++ by adding the corresponding term\n\u0011\n++\n++\n\u03b3(R) (E1++ (R)\u2212E0++ (R)) Ta \u0010\n1 \u2212 e(E1 (R)\u2212E0 (R)) (Tb \u2212Ta )\ne\nTb \u2212 Ta\n\n(3.5)\n\nto the fit (3.4). Performing a fit using (3.4) together with (3.5) shows, that the contribution\nof E0++ (R) should be well below our statistical errors, since \u03b3 is in all cases a number below\n10\u22124 , so that the total contribution of (3.5) is below 5*10\u22123 , well below the statistical errors\nfor the corrected energy E1++ . The other fit parameters agree well with the parameters\nobtained by a fit to the form (3.4) within the statistical errors. As corrected values for\nE1++ (R) we thus use the results from a fit to the form (3.4) and neglect the contribution\nof the ground state.\n3.1.4\n\nEnergy differences\n\nThe extraction of the energy differences can be treated independently from the extraction\nof the total energies. In this way the energy differences might serve as an independent\ncheck of the asymptotic results for the total energies. Using (3.2) one can obtain for the\nna\u0131\u0308ve energy differences the formula\n!\n\u0012 CP\n\u0013 h\nCP\ni\n\u03b2n,0\n\u03bbn (R, T )\nCP\nCP \u2032\n\u2212 ln\n,\n(3.6)\n= \u0112n (R) \u2212 \u0112m (R) T \u2212 ln\n\u2032\nCP \u2032\n\u03bbCP\n\u03b2m,0\nm (R, T )\nwhich is similar to (3.3) for the total energies. This formula for na\u0131\u0308ve differences is also\nvalid for the differences between excited states in a given (C, P )-channel.\nAs before we are mainly interested in the differences between the energies of the ground\nstates in different channels. For these the leading order formula for the corresponding\ncorrected energy difference is the same as in [30],\n#\n\"\nCP \u2032 (R, T )\n(R,\nT\n)\n\u03bb\n\u03bbCP\n1\na\nb\n0\nln 0CP\n\u2212\n\u2032\nTb \u2212 Ta\n\u03bb0 (R, Ta ) \u03bb0CP (R, Tb )\n(3.7)\nh\ni\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nCP\nCP \u2032\n\u2212\u03b4\u0304(R) (Tb \u2212Ta )\n\u2212\u03b4\u0304(R) Ta\n= E0 (R) \u2212 E0 (R) +\n,\n1\u2212e\n\u1fb1(R) e\nTb \u2212 Ta\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f\u03b2\n\nr0 /a\n\nR\n\nT\n\nT /r0\n\nts\n\nlat size\n\nNs\n\nNt\n\n# meas\n\n5.0\n\n3.9536(3)\n\n4-12\n\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n\n1.01\n1.52\n2.02\n2.53\n3.04\n\n2\n\n323\n363\n403\n403\n483\n\n16000\n\n1500\n2000\n6000\n12000\n16000\n\n3200\n3200\n5100\n6400\n8600\n\nTable 1. Run parameters of the simulations. r0 is the Sommer parameter, ts the temporal extent\nof the sublattices in the LW algorithm, Ns the number of updates of the sublattice containing\nthe spatial operators and Nt the number of updates of the sublattices containing only the time\ntransporters.\n\nwhere \u1fb1 is a suitable combination of the overlaps and \u03b4\u0304 corresponds to the energy gap to\nthe next excited state in the channel CP \u2032 (which is equivalent to the gap in the channel\nCP to leading order in 1/R). In addition to the energy differences between the ground\nstate energies we are also interested in the energy differences between E1++ and E0++ . In\nthis case the two terms corresponding to the mixing between E1++ and E0++ are a term of\nthe form (3.5) and a term of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n++\n++\n\u1fb1(R)\n\u03b3(R)\ne(E1 (R)\u2212E0 (R)\u2212\u03b4\u0304(R)) Ta\nTb \u2212 Ta \u03b20 (R)\n(3.8)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22124\n(E1++ (R)\u2212E0++ (R)\u2212\u03b4\u0304(R)) (Tb \u2212Ta )\n\u226a 10\n\u00d7 1\u2212e\nThe total contribution of these terms is below 5 * 10\u22123 and thus negligible compared to the\nstatistical errors. We therefore use a fit to the form (3.7) for that difference, too.\n3.2\n\nAlgorithm and simulation parameters\n\nThe need for suppression of the contributions from excited states and the onset of stringlike behavior in the large R regime demands large Wilson loops, and an efficient algorithm\nwith sufficient error reduction for large loops is needed to extract the spectrum with high\naccuracy. The algorithm used in this study is a variation of the L\u00fcscher Weisz algorithm\n[31] and discussed in detail in [30].\nOur simulations were done using the SU (2) Wilson plaquette action in 2+1 dimensions\nat \u03b2 = 5.0. The Sommer parameter is known e.g. from [29, 35, 36] and listed together with\nthe simulation parameters in table 1. In fact the lattice spacing in terms of the Sommer\nparameter is not very small, but a comparison from the results of the four different \u03b2 values\nfrom [29] and [30] shows that there is not much movement in the energies expressed in terms\nof r0 over the whole range of 5.0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 12.5. We therefore expect that our results are\nrelevant for the continuum as well. In contrast to [29, 30, 35, 36], we work with 5 different\ntemporal extents instead of 4, which leads to strong improvements in the extraction of the\nasymptotic behavior and the control of contaminations from excited states via (3.4) and\n(3.7).\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fStatistical errors are estimated using the usual binned jackknife method with 50 bins\nfor all measurements. We explicitly checked that none of the error estimates varies more\nthan a few percent with bin size.\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\nSources of systematic effects\nFinite volume effects\n\nThe first class of sources of systematic errors in addition to the ones discussed in section\n3.1 is due to finite extent L of the lattice. Here periodic boundary conditions are applied\nto the lattice, making it possible for the loops to interact with themselves by around-theworld glueball exchanges. In the string picture these exchanges corresponds to handles on\nthe world sheet, wrapping around a compactified dimension. The contribution of such a\nhandle to the signal of the Wilson loop takes the form\n\u0001\na(L\u2032 ) exp \u2212mG L\u2032 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere L\u2032 is the length of the handle, mG the mass of the lightest glueball (measured in\n[40] for SU (2) in d = 2 + 1 and at \u03b2 = 5.0) and a(L\u2032 ) is the overlap with the loop. In\nprinciple these handles can wrap around any of the directions, but it is immediately clear\nfrom (3.9) that the main contribution comes from the direction that enables the shortest\nhandle. Clearly this is the direction parallel to the spatial direction of the Wilson loop\nwhere L\u2032 = L \u2212 R. The main problem thus arises for Wilson loops with large values of R.\nFor the case of our study, 2 + 1 dimensional SU (2) with \u03b2 = 5.0, a test for finite volume\neffects with volumes of 243 and 483 , excited states up to n = 3 and R \u2264 12 already exists\n[30]. Since no finite volume effects were visible in this test, we can conclude that a(L\u2032 ) is\nat most a factor of O(1) and that we do not expect to suffer from any finite volume effects\nup to energy levels of n = 3 at least.\n3.3.2\n\nControl of the fits\n\nIn the analysis a lot of fitting is done in order to extract the energies and energy differences\nin the limit T \u2192 \u221e and to take the contaminations from excited states into account. For\nthe control of systematic effects it is thus crucial to control these fits in several ways, since\nthese are the biggest source for systematic errors in the final data.\nEven though the fits (3.3) and (3.6) include only a linear fit function it might be that\nalready these fits give biased results, since the more important points for the asymptotic\nbehavior, the points from loops with large T , come with bigger statistical errors. This\nmight lead to the problem that the fit is completely determined by the values at small T .\nAs a check we plotted the data along with the resulting lines and checked the deviations\nfrom the line of the points at large T . Where the deviations were not at the percent level\nand below the statistical errors, we discarded the fit.\nThe second type of fits, eq. (3.4) and (3.7), are much harder to control, since these\nfits include nonlinear functions of two arguments. In addition the \u03c72 /d.o.f. of these fits is\nusually very small and does not provide much information on the goodness of the fits. We\nthus apply two checks that were already discussed in [30]. We expect \u03b1 to be smaller than\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f0.12\n0.1\n+-\n\nE 1, R=5\nE+-1, R=8\nE+-1, R=11\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n\uf8e5\u2206\n\n\uf8e5\u2206\n\n0.1\n\nE+-0, R=5\nE+-0, R=8\nE+-0, R=11\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n0.02\n0\n0\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n\u2206\n\n0.06\n\u2206\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\nFigure 2.

Similar checks were performed for the energy differences, too [30].\n\n4\n\nResults of the simulations\n\nWe list all results, na\u0131\u0308ve and corrected in tables 2 and 3, to enable other groups to use\nthe data for comparisons.

The comparison to corrections from\nboundary terms is postponed to the next section.\nIn order to compare to the data we have to extract the string tension \u03c3 and fix an\nunphysical constant V0 . Since we expect corrections to appear with respect to the full NG\nprediction (as concluded e.g. in [26] and [19]), we fit the ground state data to the form\nr\n\u03c0\nV (R) = \u03c3 R 1 \u2212\n+ V0 .\n(4.1)\n12 \u03c3 R2\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f0.03\n0.025\nnaive\ncorrected\n\n0.02\n\nE*rsc\n\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\nLO\n\n0\n-0.005\n\nNG\n\n-0.01\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nR*\n\nFigure 3.

Results for the energy differences in lattice units. As in table 2 we list corrected and\nna\u0131\u0308ve results. For some differences we were able to obtain corrected but no na\u0131\u0308ve results. This is\ndue to the fact that the contaminations from excited states are large and the data points for the fit\n(3.6) do not lie on a straight line, whereas the fit (3.7) still works well.\n\nto provide visibility of small effects. We see a clear splitting between the na\u0131\u0308ve and the\ncorrected results, which increases when we go to larger values of R\u2217 . The effect becomes\neven more severe when we go to the excited states, as shown for energy level E1 in figure 4\n(top left). We can also see the approximate linear asymptotic behavior of the rescaled na\u0131\u0308ve\nenergies when going to large R values, which was seen in [22\u201324], too. The asymptotic\nbehavior of the corrected energies is different and we conclude that the behavior of the\nna\u0131\u0308ve energies is due to contributions from excited states and does not reflect the physical\nasymptotic behavior of the energies for large R. When we look at the predictions for\nthe energy gaps from (1.1) and its truncations it is easy to see why the excited state\ncontamination is enhanced. The energy gaps to the excited states decrease roughly like\n1/R, thus the damping with T is reduced in eq. (3.2) when going to larger R and more\nexcited states contribute to the contamination. In the following we therefore only use\ncorrected results for the discussions.\nThe results for E1++ and E0\u2212\u2212 , belonging to the second excited state, are shown in\nfigure 4 (top right). It is remarkable that with the new method and 5 different temporal\nextents we were able to reduce the errors for the corrected values of the ground state in\nthe (+, \u2212)-channel by a factor of more than two and to obtain corrected results for the\ngroundstate in the (\u2212, \u2212)-channel with an accuracy better than that of the results for the\nground state of the (+, \u2212)-channel in [30]. The error bars of the first excited state in\nthe (+, +)-channel are almost an order of magnitude bigger than the error bars from the\nground state of the (\u2212, \u2212)-channel, but nevertheless we see a 2 \u2212 4 sigma splitting up to\nR\u2217 \u2248 3. At that point the error of E1++ becomes to large to distinguish between the two.\nThe energy differences are listed in table 3. They have the advantage that the comparison to the predictions does not involve the unknown constant V0 from eq. (4.1) and that\nthey are more sensitive to subleading properties of the flux tube. In figure 4 we show the\ndifference E0+\u2212 \u2212 E0++ (left bottom), corresponding to the free difference \u2206E10 , and the\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f1.2\n\n2.2\n2\n\nLO\n\n1\n\n1.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.6\n\nE*rsc\n\nE*rsc\n\nNNLO\n\nLO\n\nNNLO\n\n1.1\n\n0.8\n\nNLO\n\n0.7\n\nE++1\nE--0\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\nnaive\ncorrected\n\nNG\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nNG\n\nNLO\n\n0.8\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nR*\n\n1\nLO\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nR*\n\nNNLO\n\nLO\n\n2\n\nNNLO\n\n0.95\n\n\u2206E*rsc\n\n\u2206E*rsc\n\n1.8\n\nE+-0-E++0\n\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n\n++\nE++\n1-E 0\nE--0-E++0\n\n1.6\n1.4\n\n0.75\n\nNLO\n1.2\n\n0.7\n\nNG\n\nNG\n\n0.65\n\nNLO\n\n1\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nR*\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nR*\n\nFigure 4.

We see a similar error reduction as for the absolute energy values compared to [30].\nThe qualitative agreement between the data and the NG predictions is remarkable\ndown to very small values of R\u2217 , where we do not expect the flux tube to have a string\nlike shape and where the expansion of the string action in 1/R\u2217 is no longer expected to\nconverge. These findings are in full agreement with other simulations, e.g. [29, 30, 35, 36].\nIn addition they are consistent with the results from [15, 22\u201324] for smaller values of R\u2217 and\nwith the results obtained for closed strings [25, 26]. Even though the data follows the NG\npredictions qualitatively, we see a significant deviation for the absolute energies E0+\u2212 and\nE0\u2212\u2212 , as well as for the corresponding differences to the ground state, even for our largest\nvalues of R\u2217 . We are going to compare these deviations to the boundary corrections in the\nnext section. The E1++ state is fully consistent with the NG prediction inside the error\nbars for all values of R\u2217 , which is also true for the corresponding difference E1++ \u2212 E0++ .\n\n5\n\nDiscussion of 1/R4 corrections\n\nTo compare the boundary corrections to the NG predictions with the data, we have to\nextract the unknown coefficient b2 . There is a hint from theory that b2 is negative and\nnonvanishing, coming from a computation of b2 for the case of a string ending on two d-\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\ffit\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\nV0\u2032\n\nb2\n\n\u03b30\n\n\u03b31\n\n\u03b70\n\n\u03b71\n\n\u03c72 /d.o.f.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n0.0974(1)\n0.0975(2)\n0.0975(2)\n0.0975(2)\n\n0.2151(4)\n0.2145(7)\n0.2145(6)\n0.2146(7)\n\n-0.30(4)\n-0.61(19)\n-0.52(14)\n-\n\n-\n2(3)\n-\n9(3)\n\n-\n-2(1)*103\n-\n12(3)*103\n\n-\n-\n14(11)\n-\n\n-\n-\n-11(6)*103\n-7(2)*104\n\n0.79\n0.04\n0.05\n0.22\n\nTable 4. Results for the combined fit of ground state and first excited state data to the form (5.1).\nThe different fits are described in the text.\n\nbranes in confining gauge theories with a weakly curved holographic dual [18]. Corrections\nappears at all energy levels and we demand that b2 is consistent with all data above the\ncritical distance as defined in section 2. We therefore use the ground state as well as the\nfirst excited state to extract b2 from a simultaneous fit. We also have to account for the\npossibility that the values for \u03c3 and V0 are changed due to the ground state correction.\nWe thus use them again as free parameters denoted as \u03c3 \u2032 and V0\u2032 to distinguish them from\nthe values obtained in the last section.\nIt is known that, when fitting to a polynomial, the coefficient of the highest power of the\npolynomial in the fit receives a summed contribution from possible higher order terms. This\nspoils the reliability of the highest coefficient of the fit polynomial. b2 suffers from the same\nproblem, since the fit function is a nonlinear function in \u03c3 \u2032 combined with a polynomial\ncorrection. To improve the reliability of the obtained value for b2 we include a correction\nterm of higher order to each energy level. There are in general two possibilities at which\norder the next correction term might appear. At O(R\u22126 ) if there are additional boundary\nterms in the effective action or at O(R\u22127 ) if the next correction term is a regular (nonboundary) correction. To account for these possibilities we parametrise our fit functions\nfor a simultaneous fit to the ground state and the first excited state as:\nr\n\u03c03 1\n1\n1\n\u03c0\n\u2032\n\u2212\nb\n+ \u03b30 6 + \u03b70 7 + V0\u2032\nE0 (R) = \u03c3 R 1 \u2212\n2\n\u2032\n2\n4\n12 \u03c3 R\n60 R\nR\nR\n(5.1)\nr\n3\n23 \u03c0\n241 \u03c0 1\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212 b2\n+ \u03b31 6 + \u03b71 7 + V0 ,\nE1 (R) = \u03c3 R 1 +\n12 \u03c3 \u2032 R2\n60 R4\nR\nR\nTo check the effect of the higher order terms we perform the following fits:\n1. Set \u03b3i \u2261 0 and \u03b7i \u2261 0, use b2 as a fit parameter.\n2. Set \u03b7i \u2261 0, use b2 and \u03b3i as fit parameters.\n3. Set \u03b3i \u2261 0, use b2 and \u03b7i as fit parameters.\n4. Set b2 \u2261 0 and \u03b70 \u2261 0, use \u03b3i and \u03b71 as fit parameters.\nIn all cases \u03c3 \u2032 and V0\u2032 are free parameters as well. The last fit accounts for the possibility\nthat the coefficient b2 vanishes identically, which is not yet ruled out completely by theory\nand thus remains a possibility. In the fits we include all points except the one with smallest\nR for the ground state, and all points with R \u2265 7 for the first excited state, since we expect\nthe data to be consistent with the effective string theory even for smaller values of R when\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f0.012\n1\n0.01\nNG\nLO\nfit\n2\n++\nE 0\n\n0.008\n\n0.9\nE*rsc\n\nE*rsc\n\n0.006\n\nR*c\n\n0.95\n\n0.004\n\n0.85\n\n0.002\n0\n\n0.8\n\n-0.002\n\n0.75\n\nNG\nLO\nfit 2\nfit 4\nE+-0\n\n-0.004\n0.7\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\nR*\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nR*\n\nFigure 5. Comparison between fit 2 from table 4 and the data for the groundstate (left) and the\nfirst excited state (right). The data is rescaled as in the previous figures. The line marked with\nRc\u2217 is the line below which the expansion of the corresponding energy level in 1/R\u2217 ceases to be\nconvergent.\n\nthe corrections are included. We exclude the data for the second excited state for the\nfollowing reasons: Only the largest values of R\u2217 are above the critical length below which\nthe expansion of the energy ceases to be convergent for the second excited state (see eq.\n(2.4)) and one has to include four more fit parameters \u03b32,i and \u03b72,i to the fits. Therefore the\ninclusion of the second excited state does not improve the information and the accuracy\nfor b2 . We do not account for the possibility of correction terms below O(R\u22124 ), since we\ncompare to the effective theory where these terms are explicitly ruled out.\nWe list the results of the fits in table 4. In all cases we see good agreement between\n\u2032\n\u03c3 and V0\u2032 and \u03c3 and V0 obtained in the previous section. This shows that the extraction\nof \u03c3 from the ground state is not sensitive to 1/R4 corrections within the accuracy for the\nground state data of our simulations. The result for b2 varies between fits 1 \u2212 3, but is\nsmall and negative in all cases. We expect the results for b2 from the fits 2 and 3, including\nalso the higher order terms, to be unbiased. In that case \u03b30 or \u03b70 is practically consistent\nwith zero, which is not surprising, since we expect the data for the ground state not to be\naccurate enough to make higher order corrections to a 1/R4 correction visible. \u03b31 and \u03b71\nare nonzero but still small compared to the NG coefficient at O(R\u22127 ). Fit 4 seems to work\nas well but a relatively large nonvanishing boundary term at O(R\u22126 ) is needed for the fit\nto work accurately. Nevertheless the corresponding \u03c72 /d.o.f. is a magnitude bigger than\nfor the fits 2 and 3 (even though it is still below one). Assuming that b2 does not vanish\nidentically we find the data to be consistent with\nb2 = \u22120.5(2)(2) ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second reflects the systematical uncertainty,\nestimated from the variation of b2 between fits 1-3.\nTo compare to the data, we use fit 2 from table 4 and show the corresponding plots for\nthe ground state and the first excited state in figure 5. We use \u03c3 and V0 as before (instead\nof \u03c3 \u2032 and V0\u2032 ) to rescale the data points and show also the NG lines from the previous\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f2.2\nR*c\n\n2\nNG\nLO\nE2,1\nE2,2\nE++\n1\nE--0\n\nE*rsc\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nR*\n\nFigure 6. Comparison between the data for the second excited state and the corrected energy\nlevels E2,1 = E2N G + \u01eb2,1 and E2,2 = E2N G + \u01eb2,2 with b2 obtained from fit 2. The data is rescaled\nas in the previous figures.\n\nsection for comparison. It is remarkable that we can accurately describe the corrections to\ntwo different energy states with a predicted splitting and a single coefficient. In addition\nwe also show the resulting curve from fit 4 for the first excited state. We see that it deviates\na little bit more from the data than the curve obtained from fit 2, but is well inside the\nerror bars and describes the data as well.\nHaving fixed b2 through the fit (in this case fit 2), we now get a prediction for the two\ncurves corresponding to the second excited state, where the degeneracy is lifted. We show\nthe corresponding curves together with the data in figure 6. Additional terms of O(R\u22126 )\nor higher are excluded here, since we do not know anything about their coefficients and we\nexpect the effects to be of minor importance at the present level of accuracy of the data.\nWe see that the curve E2,1 stays below the E2,2 curve which is consistent with the behavior\nof the data. Nevertheless the data is closer to the NG curve when R\u2217 < 3, which is well\nbelow Rc\u2217 for the second excited state. Above Rc\u2217 the data for E0\u2212\u2212 approaches the E2,2\ncurve, but it is not clear whether the behavior with increasing R\u2217 remains consistent with\nthe resulting curve. The data for E1++ is consistent with the E2,1 curve already below Rc\u2217 ,\nbut the error bars above Rc\u2217 are to large to exclude the approach to any of the three curves.\nThe energy differences provide another check for the fits of this section. We show the\ncurves obtained with the parameters from the fit above and the corresponding data in fig.\n7. Above Rc\u2217 we see perfect agreement between the \u2206E10 curve including the correction\nand the data. For \u2206E20 the picture is similar as for the total energies at n = 2, the data\nis roughly consistent with the predictions.\nWe can employ yet another independent check and use the splitting between first\nexcited state and ground state directly to obtain b2 . In that case we can keep \u03c3 and V0\nfixed, which are almost completely determined by the groundstate. When we include an\nadditional correction term at O(R\u22126 ) we obtain b2 = \u22120.56(23) with \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 0.03. This\nresult is consistent with the results from the fits to the total energies. All in all, together\nwith the hint from the effective theory that b2 should be nonvanishing, we consider the\npossibility of a vanishing 1/R4 correction to be unlikely with our present data.

Comparison between the data for the energy differences \u2206E10 (left) and \u2206E20 (right)\nand the predictions with b2 obtained from fit 2. The data is rescaled as in the previous figures. We\nhave used the abbreviations \u2206\u01eb10 = \u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb0 , \u2206\u01eb20,1 = \u01eb2,1 \u2212 \u01eb0 and \u2206\u01eb20,2 = \u01eb2,2 \u2212 \u01eb0 .\n\nfor ground state and first excited state is well described by the predicted splitting of the\neffective theory with a single coefficient b2 . Also the behavior of the second excited state,\nwhich was not included in the fits, suits to the predictions.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this article we have looked at the energies of the excited states of the flux tube between\nstatic quark and antiquark in three-dimensional SU (2) gauge theory, using a combination\nof the algorithm from [30] and a variational method. We studied q q\u0304 separations between\n1 and 3 r0 and energy levels up to n = 2. We have discussed the main systematic effects\nentering the extraction of the excited states in detail, explained under which conditions we\nconsider the results to be unaffected by any of these effects and included only those results\nin the analysis where systematics are under control. The only remaining systematic effect\nwhich is not investigated is the lattice spacing dependence, but results from [29, 30, 35, 36]\nsuggests that the dependence on the lattice spacing is very mild. Using the correlation\nmatrices in the (C, P ) channels and 5 different temporal extents, we were able to further\nreduce the errors compared to [30] and to obtain a clear signal for the second excited state.\nIn addition we were able to obtain results for the first excited state in the (+, +) channel,\nwhich is degenerate to the ground state in the (+, \u2212) channel in the free theory. The\neffective string theory predicts a splitting of these formerly degenerate states and indeed\nwe observe such a splitting in our data. In all cases we see the same qualitative agreement\nwith the NG predictions as observed for previous measurements in the three-dimensional\ncase, e.g. [29, 30, 35, 36].\nNevertheless, with enhanced accuracy and improved control over systematic effects we\nsee a significant deviation from the NG curves and compare it with the predictions from\n[18, 19]. Our data is in good agreement with the predicted 1/R4 boundary correction to\nthe effective string theory, even though we cannot exclude the possibility that boundary\ncorrections do not appear until O(R\u22126 ). If we assume that b2 does not vanish identically\nwe find evidence that b2 is small and negative, b2 = \u22120.5(2)(2), where the first error is\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fstatistical and the second systematic. The resulting curves are in good agreement with\nthe data and it is remarkable that we can describe the data accurately with the predicted\nsplitting. The negative sign of the result is consistent with the sign of the result for confining\ngauge theories with a weakly curved holographic dual, applied to the case of a string ending\non two d-branes [18]. This is the first time that significant deviations from NG energy levels\ncould be observed for open strings in three dimensions. In the case of closed strings and in\nthe finite temperature behavior of the string tension analogous deviations were observed\nin [26] and [41].\nTo confirm the findings of this paper it is desirable to check the consistency with\nearlier results, as e.g. the results for the ground state from [33, 34], and to perform\nsimulations at additional lattice spacings. One would also like to have a precise prediction\nfor the coefficient b2 to compare with, which is hard to get if b2 is not constrained by any\nsymmetry. In addition it would be interesting to see whether b2 is universal or whether it\nvaries between different theories. To clarify the picture one also has to push the simulations\nto bigger values of R, in order to reach the region of a convergent expansion for the higher\nenergy levels, and to further increase the precision for the excited states.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe simulations were mainly done on the Linux cluster LC2 at the ZDV of the Johannes\nGutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz.
