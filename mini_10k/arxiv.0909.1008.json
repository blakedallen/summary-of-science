This is not to\nsay that we reject the Jeffreysian tenet that Bayes\nfactors naturally downweight complex models with\nlimited support from the data, since we support this\npoint, but rather that the support for more complex\nmodels should come from the prior or from a loss\nfunction, rather than from the complexity-hungry\nlikelihood. (The social scientist attitude that worries\nabout missing some factor could also be questioned\nas being too optimistic in its belief in models.) Finally, we concede that Bayesian data analysis may\nforce us to move away from the \"ideal\" standards set\nby Harold Jeffreys's Theory of Probability, including\nthe reliance on the Bayes factor. Bayesian model\ncriticism, indeed a major direction in Gelman et al.\n(2001), is still in its infancy and would correctly require more emphasis in our papers and in our practice! As put by Professor Gelman, we need to learn\nmore from \"the failures of a statistical model's attempt to capture reality.\"\n3. ON KASS' COMMENTS\nWe are grateful to Professor Kass for his comments that follow a talk given during the Harold\nJeffreys's Theory of Probability anniversary session\nat the O-Bayes 2009 meeting. There is actually very\nlittle we can disagree with in these comments which\nshow a deep and scholarly knowledge of Theory of\nProbability and expose our need to pursue our study\nof this profound book.\nThe connection with geometry was bound to be\npart of Professor Kass' comments and we do agree\nwith the essential feature of looking for orthogonal\nparameterisation, a point which, in our awkward\nphrasing, we would relate to the search for a constant information parameterization. We also appreciate the emphasis on Laplace's approximations that\npermeate the book and provide an early link with\nBayesian asymptotics. The epistemological implications of Theory of Probability are certainly worth\nstressing (a point also made by Professor Zellner)\nif only because Harold Jeffreys was first and foremost a physicist who developed his own statistical\ntools to deal with his own physics problems. The\nspecific points made by Professor Kass about the nature of statistical models would be worth emphasising during any course in applied and even methodological statistics (as are the central discussions by\nErich Lehmann and David Cox in the 1990 volume\n\nof this journal). That Bayesian testing, or any kind\nof testing, remains a source for discussion and further research is clearly illustrated by the number of\ncomments and the variety of proposals on this point.\nFinally, the lack of decision theory is an issue that we\nalso deplore, in agreement with Professors Bernardo\nand Lindley as well, if not Professor Zellner.\n4. ON LINDLEY'S COMMENTS\nBesides so kindly contributing to the discussion\ntherein, Professor Lindley patiently and helpfully\nenlightened us on the construction and contents of\nTheory of Probability during the preparation of the\npaper. We are therefore deeply indebted to him for\nsharing so much with us. His comments bring a\nunique perspective to the discussion, both from historical and foundational viewpoints. As a witness\nof the early developments of Theory of Probability, Professor Lindley exposes the philosophical cum\npractical reasons for the composition of this book.\nThe point about Section 3.10 and the integration\nover the sample space was missed in our analysis but\nis indeed crucial in its link with the likelihood principle that does not appear per se in Theory of Probability. Nowadays, this is certainly the most standard\nexample that illustrates how the principle for constructing Jeffreys's priors may violate the likelihood\nprinciple (Berger and Wolpert, 1988). (The opposition with deFinetti's perspective is also worth noticing, since they approached Bayesian statistics from\nfundamentally different perspectives, even though\ntheir respective books share the same title.)\nThe fact that uncertainty must be analyzed in\nprobabilistic terms is certainly a driving force in\nTheory of Probability and a convincing reason to\nfollow Bayesian ways. We completely agree that this\nformalization is one of Harold Jeffreys's great inputs.\nOnce again, the other fundamental input stressed\nboth by Professor Lindley and ourselves is the complete formalization of a coherent approach to testing\nvia Bayes factors. Professor Lindley is 100% correct\nin his assessment of the opposition of this view with\nPopper's and of its persistence (Templeton, 2008):\nrejecting a model based on its \"falsity\" is only feasible when considering the available alternatives. That\nTheory of Probability does not directly dwell on decisions is clearly a feature of the time, even though\nKeynes had opened the way a few years earlier, but\nthis did not prevent a formalization of Bayesian testing procedures that proved itself compatible with\n\"0\u20131\" loss functions, thus showing the insight in\nHarold Jeffreys's intuitions.\n\n\fREJOINDER\n\n5. ON SENN'S COMMENTS\nGiven the tone of some earlier comments of Professor Senn on the Bayesian paradigm, we must acknowledge our pleasant surprise at his conciliatory\ntone in these comments. Thankfully, the barbed parody of Harold Jeffreys's most quoted sentence somehow re-establishes the balance! We are quite grateful to Professor Senn for his laudatory remarks, even\nthough we must acknowledge that our copies of\nHarold Jeffreys's Theory of Probability are also full\nof pencil annotations and question marks, and also\nthat it took two series of lectures to achieve this\nincomplete state of awareness. We furthermore enjoyed the mention that Harold Jeffreys considered\nBayesian significance tests as the most important\npart of Theory of Probability, since this agrees with\nboth Professor Lindley's and our perceptions.\nWe dearly appreciate the further historical details provided by Professor Senn's comments, particularly in that the exchange between Ronald Fisher\nand Harold Jeffreys is represented in much less a\ncontroversial tone that we could have believed! [The\nfirst author also commented on Berger, Bernardo\nand Sun (2009) about the particular matter of the\nLaw of Succession and so we do not need to repeat the comments here.] Similarly, the confusion\nabout Bernoulli shows how amateurish is our attempt at Science History. We are equally grateful to\nProfessor Senn for pointing out Bartlett's connection, as we must confess we were not even aware of\nit! When reading Bartlett's comments, we came to\nrealize his contribution to the exclusion of improper\npriors for Bayes factors, as analyzed in deeper details by Bickel and Ghosh (1990).\n6. ON ZELLNER'S COMMENTS\nUnsurprisingly, Professor Zellner's comments-that\nhe delivered quite enthusiastically during his lecture\nat O-Bayes 2009-are opening new vistas on Theory of Probability, while differing from our analysis\non several points. The first issue is that Theory of\nProbability was aimed at scientists at large, while\nwe read it as statisticians. This is unavoidable, given\nour background and, further, we doubt many nonstatisticians would have the time and the will to go\nthrough Theory of Probability. Unfortunately, most\nof them seem to eschew modern Bayesian introductions to the benefit of shorter reviews published in\ntheir own discipline. We completely agree with Professor Zellner that we failed to understand the historical undercurrents explaining the connection of\n\n3\n\nTheory of Probability with the philosophy of science\nat the time it was written. This is not to say we\nmissed the global impact of Theory of Probability on\nscientific modeling and its definition of induction, a\npoint already stressed by Professor Kass, because it\nobviously represents the major impact of the book,\nbut the style of the discussions about the axiomatic\nnature of probability and our lack of background in\nthis area led us to bypass them to focus on the link\nwith modern Bayesian statistics. (Neither does the\n\"proof\" of Bayes' theorem strike us as ultimately\nnecessary, once the axiomatic definition of probability is agreed upon.) The coherence of the system for\nscientific induction presented in Theory of Probability is what struck us the most in Theory of Probability, even though we presumably skimmed too fast\nover this point.\nAs already noted (with a different twist) in the discussion about Professor Gelman's comments, there\nis no end to the debate about non-informative priors and, while Professor Zellner's maximal data information prior is an interesting alternative to Jeffreys's, Laplace's and Haldane's solutions, there is\nno reason to believe the community as a whole will\neventually agree upon this point. We obviously appreciate the derivation of this prior based on a specific information criterion developed by Professor\nZellner. In a historical perspective, it may well be\nthat the notions of \"objective\" or \"noninformative\"\nare not appropriate for the (Statistics of the) mid1930s.\nThe conclusion presented by Professor Zellner reproduces Seymour Geisser's assessment of Theory\nof Probability, for which we are both grateful and in\ncomplete agreement.\n7. CONCLUSION\nWe are most grateful to the contributors for their\nlively discussions, which illustrate how influential\nJeffreys's ideas still are today. Maybe the most striking aspect in Theory of Probability is Harold Jeffreys's intuition that a completely coherent system\ncould be designed for Bayesian analysis, a system\nupon which we are still building today.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis reply was written after the first author attended both the O-Bayes 2009 and MaxEnt 2009\nconferences.
