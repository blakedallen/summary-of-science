Stars: fundamental parameters, Stars: late-type, (Galaxy:) solar neighbourhood, Galaxy: stellar content\n\n1. Introduction\nAges and metallicities of dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood provide a unique record of the progressive chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium where the stars\nformed. As time progresses the interstellar medium becomes more and more enriched in heavy elements. Thus\nwe may expect the more recently formed stars to have a\nhigher metallicity than those formed at an earlier epoch.\nBy obtaining ages as well as metallicities for a representative stellar sample we should therefore be able to derive\nan age-metallicity relation. Such a relation would provide\na strong constraint on any model of galactic chemical evolution. The picture might of course be more complicated,\ne.g. including infall of unprocessed gas or stellar migration. However, such processes can be modeled and the\nobserved age-metallicity diagram would again provide a\nstrong constraint on any model.\nAre such simplistic assumptions borne out by observational evidence? The current evidence, from both new and\nolder studies, appear to point in conflicting directions. The\nstudies by Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000) and Twarog (1980ab)\nSend offprint requests to: Sofia Feltzing\n\u22c6\nBased on results from the ESA Hipparcos satellite\n\ndo find good correlations between age and metallicity for\ndwarf stars in the local galactic disk. On the other hand\nseveral recent investigations appear to indicate that in\nfact the picture is rather more complicated with metalrich stars being both young and old, e.g. Edvardsson et\nal. (1993), Carraro et al. (1998), Chen et al. (2000), and\nFeltzing & Gonzalez (2001). For example in Edvardsson et\nal. (1993) the derived age-metallicity relation has a scatter\naround the mean [Fe/H] at a given age that is four times\nas large as the relative error on individual [Fe/H] values.\nThus strongly indicating that the observed scatter is indeed real and not due to observational errors. As pointed\nout by Carraro et al. (1998) this means that the challenge\nfor models of galactic chemical evolution has shifted from\nfocusing on trying to reproduce an average trend, produced by binning in age and calculating mean [Me/H] (the\nage-metallicity relation), to reproduce the overall trends\nas well as the observed scatter.\nHowever, it should be remembered that most of the\nstudies mentioned above include small numbers of stars,\nranging from a few (Feltzing & Gonzalez 2001) to \u223c 200\nEdvardsson et al. (1993). Several of them are concerned\nmainly with stellar abundance analysis which naturally\nlimited the stellar samples in size. Furthermore, these sam-\n\n\f2\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nples were selected in order to study specific aspects of the\ngalactic chemical evolution (Edvardsson et al. 1993 and\nChen et al. 2000) or a specific type of stars (Feltzing &\nGonzalez 2001) and are therefore not directly representative of the solar neighbourhood.\nThe new large database of good stellar parallaxes presented in the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997) provides a\nunique opportunity to investigate the age-metallicity plot\nusing a larger number of stars. In the study presented here\nwe investigate, using 5828 stars, the structures and trends\nin the age-metallicity plot.\nThe article is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we describe the stellar sample used and how we determine the\nstellar parameters, [Me/H], Teff , and age (\u03c4 ). These are\ncompared with those derived in other studies and in Sect.\n2.3.3 we provide a detailed discussion of stellar ages determined from chromospheric indices. Sect. 3 presents and\ndiscusses selection effects in the age-metallicity plot, the\nimplications of our findings are further discussed in Sect.\n4. Finally Sect. 5 contains our conclusions.\n\n2. Data\nWe selected all stars in the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA,\n1997) that had Str\u00f6mgren uvby-photometry available in\nthe large catalogue compiled by Hauck & Mermilliod\n(1998). Further restrictions on which stars would be allowed into our catalogue were imposed by the interval in\nb \u2212 y, m1 , and c1 in which the calibrations of [Fe/H] and\nTeff are valid, see Sect. 2.2. Furthermore, we required all\nthe stars to have a relative error in the parallax less than\n25 %. This was deemed necessary in order to be able to\nderive reliable ages. The need to impose this constraint\nwill be further demonstrated in Sect. 2.3.\n\n2.1. Binarity\nFor binary stars we cannot determine stellar ages, neither\neffective temperatures nor metallicities by simply using\nthe available stellar isochrones and available calibrations\nof uvby-photometry. To ensure that the contamination of\nour sample from binaries is minimized we excluded all\nstars that were flagged either as proved binaries or as probable binaries in the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997), e.g.\nall stars with CCDM number. To be as conservative as\npossible we excluded all stars that were either detected\nthrough the Hipparcos survey as binaries or had other\nindications of binarity, e.g. a stochastic solution or were\nmarked as suspected non-single.\nOf the 14112 stars for which we have uvby-photometry\nand for which ages could be determined, 3946 stars were\nrejected due to being binaries or potential binaries. In this\nway we ensure that the stellar sample is as free as possible from binaries. Obviously undetected close binaries can\nstill be in the sample. These can be discovered through\nspectroscopy.\n\n2.2. Metallicity and effective temperature\ndeterminations\nFor each star we determine estimates of the interstellar\nreddening toward the star by using the model of Hakkila\net al. (1997). We also apply the Lutz-Kelker correction to\nthe magnitudes using the mean bias correction term from\nKoen (1992) with index p=4 (see Ng & Bertelli, 1998, for\na discussion of the relevance of this correction to age determinations). The corrected magnitudes and colours are\nthen used to derive metallicities and effective temperatures.\nMetallicities were derived using the calibration by\nSchuster & Nissen (1989). This calibration is valid for G\ndwarf stars for 0.37 \u2264 (b \u2212 y) \u2264 0.59 and for F dwarf stars\nfor 0.22 \u2264 (b \u2212 y) \u2264 0.38 (their Eq. (3) and (2) respectively).\nEffective temperatures were derived using the calibration\nin Eq. (9) in Alonso et al. (1996). This calibration is valid\nfor 0.25 <\n\u223cb\u2212y <\n\u223c 0.7.\nBy using these two calibrations we exclude a number\nof stars from further study. The red cut in b \u2212 y for the\nSchuster & Nissen (1989) calibration excludes a large number of late K dwarf stars. This, however, is not a problem\nfor us since it is not possible to derive ages for stars that\nfar down on the main-sequence where all ages (for a given\nmetallicity) are degenerate. As can be seen from the limits given above it is the determination of the metallicities\nthat imposes further cuts in our sample.\n\n2.2.1. Comparison with other studies - Metallicities\nWe check the metallicities derived from the Str\u00f6mgren\nphotometry (hereafter denoted [Me/H]) by comparing\nthem with spectroscopic measurements available in the\nliterature (denoted [Fe/H]). It is especially important to\nmake the comparison with large samples that have been\nhomogeneously treated. We have chosen two recent large\nspectroscopic studies, Edvardsson et al. (1993) and Chen\net al. (2000), Fig. 1.\nThe large catalogue by Cayrel de Strobel et al. (1997)\nwas not considered here since this is a compilation of data\nfrom many different spectroscopic studies and although\nvery valuable in many ways a comparison with that catalogue would not address the issue about the goodness of\nour metallicity determinations in a systematic way.\nFrom the comparison we find that the systematic differences and scatters are\n[Me/H]This\n\nwork\n\n\u2212 [Fe/H]E93 = +0.01 \u00b1 0.10\n\nand\n[Me/H]This\n\nwork\n\n\u2212 [Fe/H]Chen00 = +0.02 \u00b1 0.11.\n\n\fSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of photometric ([Me/H]) and spectroscopic ([Fe/H]) determinations of the stellar metallicity\nand iron abundance respectively with Edvardsson et al.\n(1993) and with Chen et al. (2000)\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Comparison of effective temperatures derived in\nthis work and in Edvardsson et al. (1993) and with Chen\net al. (2000)\n\n2.3. Determination of stellar ages\nSchuster & Nissen (1989) found that the uncertainty\nin their calibration of [Fe/H] was 0.16 dex. Our results,\nbased on a comparison of spectroscopic and photometric\nmetallicities for a larger and more homogeneous sample\nthen that used in Schuster & Nissen (1998), in fact shows\nthat their calibration is even better than 0.16 dex. We\nthus conclude that our [Me/H] are in very good agreement with spectroscopically derived [Fe/H] and that we\ncan expect the errors in derived ages from errors in the\n[Fe/H] determination to indeed be small.\n\n2.2.2. Comparison with other studies - Effective\ntemperatures\nIn Fig. 2 we compare the effective temperatures we derive using Str\u00f6mgren photometry with those derived in\nEdvardsson et al. (1993). We find a mean difference of\n\u221221 K with a scatter of 72 K for the 120 stars in common between our full sample and that of Edvardsson et\nal. (1993). Comparing with the Chen et al. (2000) sample we find a mean difference in effective temperature of\n+38 K with a scatter of 80 K for the 47 stars in common.\nWe thus feel justified in considering our effective temperatures well defined and that we can assume that our effective temperatures, as compared with spectroscopically\ndetermined values, have an error of not more than 100 K\nfor the majority of the stars.\n\nTo determine the age of each star in our sample we make\nuse of the rapid stellar evolution algorithm presented by\nHurley et al. (2000). This algorithm comprises a detailed\nset of evolution functions which cover all evolutionary\nphases from the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) up to,\nand including, remnant phases such as naked helium stars\nand white dwarfs. All the functions are analytic, except\nat a few special points, and are valid for masses between\n0.1 and 100 M\u2299 and metallicities from Z = 10\u22124 to 0.03.\nThe functions themselves are derived from the grid of evolutionary tracks produced by Pols et al. (1998) using the\ndetailed Eggleton evolution code (Han et al. 1994). These\ntracks include a modest amount of enhanced mixing beyond the classical boundary of convective instability, i.e.\nconvective overshoot, and are approximated by the functions to within an accuracy of 5% across the entire grid.\nThe hydrogen and helium abundances are functions of the\nmetallicity: X = 0.76 \u2212 3.0Z and Y = 0.24 + 2.0Z.\nFor each star we have the observationally determined\nquantities of metal abundance, [Me/H], absolute magnitude, MV , and effective temperature, log Teff which define\na point on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The stellar\nevolution algorithm is then used to provide a theoretical\nmass and age appropriate to this point by minimizing the\nquantity\nq\n2\n2\n(1)\n\u01eb = (MV,o \u2212 MV,t ) + 16 (log Teff,o \u2212 log Teff,t )\n(cf. Ng & Bertelli 1998). The subscripts o and t refer\nto observational and theoretical quantities respectively.\n\n\f4\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nAssuming that the observational point does not lie below the ZAMS and can be reached within the maximum\nallowed evolution time, then for most stars \u01eb is limited\nonly by the tolerance chosen for the fitting process. This\nis because the evolution algorithm is continuous in mass,\nmetallicity and age across the entire parameter space. We\nset the maximum allowed age to be 15.0 Gyr. We assume\nthat all stars in our sample are either in the main-sequence\n(MS), Hertzsprung-gap or first giant branch phases of evolution, so in general the mass and age chosen is unique\nfor the observational point. This is not always true if the\npoint lies near the MS hook feature on an evolution track,\nas some overlap occurs in this region, but as this phase is\nrapid only a minimal error is introduced.\nThe appropriate bolometric corrections required for\nthe conversion of theoretical luminosity provided by the\nevolution functions to MV are obtained from the synthetic\nstellar spectra computed by Kurucz (1992). We add to this\nan extra correction of \u20130.123 to account for the difference\nin solar offset between the models of Kurucz (1992) and\nBessel et al. (1998). To convert from metal abundance to\nmetallicity we use\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(2)\nZ = 0.76/ 3.0 + 37.425 \u00d7 10\u2212[Me/H]\nas given by Pols et al. (1998). Mass loss is included in\nthe stellar evolution algorithm but this option is not utilized here as the rates are uncertain and most stars in our\nsample are not evolved enough for mass loss to noticeably\naffect the derived ages.\nAfter fitting an age and a mass for each star in the\nstandard data set we repeat the process taking the assumed errors in the data into account. These errors are\n\u00b1100 K in Teff and \u00b10.10 in [Me/H]. For each star we also\nvaried the MV according to the 1\u03c3 error in the parallax.\nThis gives 7 sets of age, mass and \u01eb for each star from\nwhich an average age can be calculated according to the\nnumber of good fits. We arbitrarily determine a good fit\nto require \u01eb \u2264 0.02, i.e. corresponding to a fitting error of\n0.005 in log Teff if MV,o = MV,t .\n\n2.3.1. What is a good stellar age?\nWhat is a good age? Our method of determining the stellar ages allows several ways of determining this. The goodness of the fit is estimated through Eq. (1). As described\nin the previous section we make seven age estimates for\neach star. An age estimate is deemed good if \u01eb < 0.02\nwhich corresponds to an error in log Teff of 0.005 if the\ninput MV is the true MV . The majority of the stars (8945\nof 10166 stars or 88 %) have six or seven good fits. 253\nof the stars have no good fit. Stars with fewer good fits\nare not necessarily bad. For example, a metal-rich very\nold star situated on the sub-giant branch might fall below\nthe stellar evolutionary tracks when the metallicity is decreased or the magnitude increased, thus yielding a bad\nfit. However, such a star is still a \"good\" star and should\nbe included into further considerations.\n\nTable 1. Stellar parameters derived in this work. n indicates the number of good fits.

See the\ntext for explanation of \u03c3\u03c4 and \u03c4mean\n\nTo quantify this we find the mean age for each star\nusing only the good fits. Then we calculate the scatter\naround the mean age, \u03c3\u03c4 . However, it is only the \u03c3\u03c4 in\nrelation to the mean age determined that give useful information. Figure 3 shows the distribution of \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean for all\nstars with more than 1 good fit, i.e. when the concept of \u03c3\u03c4\nbecomes meaningful. 3744 stars have \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean > 0.5. We\nwill use 0.5 as the dividing point between what we deem\na good and a less good age. This number is not magical in\nany sense but inspection of individual stars has lead us to\nthe conclusion that this is a reasonable cut-off. Figures 4\nand 5 show the variation \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean as a function of mean\nage and absolute magnitude. From now on we will only\ninclude stars with \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264 0.5 and at least two good\nfits.\nDetermination of stellar ages becomes progressively\nmore difficult and uncertain as we proceed to fainter\n\n\fSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 4. \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean as a function of \u03c4mean for all stars in the\nfull sample\n\n5\n\nFig. 6. Comparison of ages derived in this work and in\nNg & Bertelli (1998). Errors bars are indicated if they\nare larger than 1.5 Gyr. Only stars that have MV < 4.4,\n\u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264 0.5 and the number of good fits in both studies\nare larger than 1 are included. A linear least square fit,\ntaking the indicated errors into account, is also shown\n\nWe will henceforth take this as our lower limit for including stars into our discussions.\n\n2.3.2. Comparison with Ng & Bertelli (1998)\n\nFig. 5. \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean as a function of absolute magnitude for\nall stars in the full sample.\n\nand fainter stars in the HR-diagram because the stellar\nisochrones gets closer and closer. For too (absolutely) faint\nstars there will be a tendency to over-estimate the stellar\nage. To find out where our method finds its limit we have\nstudied those Hyades stars present in our sample that are\nalso in Perryman et al. (1998). From this we find that our\nages start to become systematically older below MV > 4.4.\n\nIn Fig. 6 we compare the ages derived here with those\nof Ng & Bertelli (1998) for the Edvardsson et al. (1993)\nsample. This is a particularly valuable comparison since\nwe are basically using the same method to determine our\nfits of the stellar tracks to the data points but use different\nsets of stellar evolutionary tracks, see Pols et al. (1998) and\nBertelli et al. (1994). The overall agreement is good. We\nnote that there are stars that deviate significantly from the\ngeneral trend. However, the age determinations for those\nstars also have large errorbars and most of them would,\nwithin the estimate error, fit well into the general trend.\nThis is especially true for the oldest stars. It is also to\nbe expected that the oldest stars should have the largest\nerrors on their derived ages since stellar iscohrones crowd\nrelatively more for old ages than for young.\n\n2.3.3. Isochrone vs chromospheric ages\nStellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones are not the only\nway to determine stellar ages. Especially the method of using chromospheric indices to date stars has recently been\napplied in studies of the star-formation history and agemetallicity relation of the stellar disk in the Galaxy. The\n\n\f6\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 7. These panels show an illustration\nof the effects on the distribution of stellar ages when the calibration from RochaPinto & Maciel (1998) is applied to a sample of stars. a A simulated age-metallicity\nplot (ages derived from chromospheric indices). b the ages corrected according to\nEqns. (3) and (4) in Rocha-Pinto & Maciel\n(1998). c and d show the respective histograms of the ages for plot a and b\n\nresults have been presented in a series of papers by RochaPinto and co-authours, e.g. Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000). In\nthe context of the stellar ages the paper by Rocha-Pinto\n& Maciel (1998) is the important paper which details the\nexact way the ages are determined.\nIn brief their method relies on one of several possible relations derived by Soderblom et al. (1991) between\n\u2032\nthe RHK\nindex and the age of a star, \u03c4chr . This relation is,\nin Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998), calibrated onto isochrone\nages, \u03c4iso . The calibration is done using 40 stars in common\nbetween their sample and that of Edvardsson et al. (1993).\nThe more up-to-date ages from Ng & Bertelli (1998) for\nthe Edvardsson et al. (1993) sample were used. The difference of the log \u03c4chr and log \u03c4iso is found as a function of\n[Fe/H] (Fig. 1b in Rocha-Pinto & Maciel 1998). This correction is then applied to the chromospheric ages for their\nstars. There are three points worth noting about this calibration: 1) the relation found by Soderblom et al. (1991) is\nby no means unique (see discussions in Soderblom et al.),\n2) the calibration between the difference of log \u03c4chr and\nlog \u03c4iso as a function of [Fe/H] is not well defined, another\npolynomial (even a straight line) could fit equally well (no\nerrors on the fitting are given), 3) it is not clear that the\nfitting formula does not suffer from selection biases, i.e. a\nsmall number of stars are involved and the scatter is large.\nWith regards to the last point we note in particular the the\ncorrection formula found in Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998),\nbecause it is the \u2206 log \u03c4 that is determined, applies a correction factor to the ages such that a large age will get a\nlarge correction factor while a small age, with the same\n[Me/H], will only have a small correction. Moreover, the\ncorrection formula is so constructed that no matter where\nthe star is originally in the age-metallicity plot, old, metalrich stars will have a large correction factor, making them\nyounger, and young, metal-poor stars will have a small\n\ncorrection factor, i.e. making them older. In this way all\nmetal-rich old stars will automatically become young and\nthe majority of young, metal-poor will become old. Thus\na one-to-one age metallicity relation will automatically be\nfound using the derived correction formula no matter how\nthe stars are first distributed in the age-metallicity diagram.\nAs a simple illustration of the described effect using the\ncorrections according to Eqns. (3) and (4) in Rocha-Pinto\n& Maciel (1998) we have randomly distributed stars in an\nage-metallicity plot and then applied the correction factor\nto these (chromospheric) ages. The results are exemplified\nin Fig. 7. As can be seen here the correction factor moves\nall stars in the upper right hand corner to the left and\nthe majority of the stars in the lower left hand corner are\nmoved to the right. Many are moved altogether outside\nthe plot and in Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998) these stars\nare disregarded from further study.\nWe have made extensive comparisons of the ages we\nderive from stellar evolutionary tracks with those determined by Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998). In total there are\n261 stars in common between their work and that presented here. For stars with MV < 4.4 and \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5 (in\nour determination) we compare the chromospheric ages\nwith our ages derived from stellar evolutionary tracks in\nFig. 8.\nWe were especially concerned to check that our method\ndid not give spurious old ages when in reality the star\nwas young, as indicated by the chromospheric activity. To\ncheck this we simply plotted the stars in the HR-diagram\ntogether with stellar evolutionary tracks from Bertelli et\nal. (1994).\nFor completeness we also compare the [Me/H] derived\nby us and by Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998), Fig. 9. The\nagreement is good. The difference between the two studies\n\n\fSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\n7\n\nbetween their study and our are almost all inactive stars,\nso this correction would have little influence on the overall\ncomparison of our results.\nWe want in particular to stress here that we do not\nsay that stellar ages can not be derived reliably from chromospheric indices. Especially for young stars this method\nappears very attractive and would be a much needed complement to isochrone ages since it is notoriously difficult,\nnot to say impossible, to derive reliable isochrone ages\nbelow \u223c 1 Gyr due to the crowding of isochrones in the\nHR-diagram. However, we are not equally convinced that\nthey can be used to derive stellar ages for the oldest stars\nin the galactic disk and would, in fact, caution against\nthis.\n\n3. The age-metallicity plot\n\nFig. 8. Comparison of ages derived in this work and in\nRocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998). Only stars with more than\none good fit and with MV < 4.4 and \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5 are\nincluded\nis 0.06\u00b10.09. This is before applying corrections according\nto Eqn. (5) in Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998). However,\nthis correction is only for chromospherically active stars\n(compare their Figure 5). Most of the stars in common\n\nFig. 9. Comparison of metallicities derived by us and by\nRocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998). In panel b. we show the\ndifference between the two determinations in the sense\nour results-their results\n\nWe now turn to consider the age-metallicity plot of local\ndisk stars. Figure 10 shows the plot including all stars in\nour sample with errors in the mean less than 50 % and\nMV < 4.4. The plot includes 5828 stars.\nThe main impressions from this plot are the large\nspread both in age and metallicity as well as a pronounced\nstructure around 2 Gyr. Is what we are seeing the true\npicture or are we here subject to influences of different\nselection effects?\n\n3.1. The old, metal-rich stars\nOne of the most prominent features of Fig. 10 is the\nvery real presence of stars that are both metal-rich, i.e.\n[Me/H]> 0.0, and old, i.e. with an age greater than 10\nGyr. The presence of such stars, if real, clearly indicates\nthat the star formation history of the disk has been very\ncomplicated with regions (perhaps in the inner disk?) that\nquickly reached a high metallicity.\nSome of our high age objects are at the bottom of\nthe giant branch in the HR-diagram and would thus have\nsomewhat more uncertain ages, even though their formal\nerrors are small, due to the difficulties in the exact modeling of this region. However, all the stars with high metallicities and high ages are turn-off objects and are thus not\nsusceptible to such errors in the age determination.\nWe have applied reddening corrections to the observed\nmagnitudes for all our stars before deriving their stellar\nparameters. Our reddening estimated are based on the\nmodel by Hakkila et al. (1997). In order to check if this\nmodel has in any way systematically over-corrected the\nreddening for stars that are metal-rich we select all stars\nwith E(b \u2212 y) < 0.005, i.e. virtually negligible corrections,\nand plot the age-metallicity diagram for these 716 stars in\nFig. 11. Although much fewer stars now appear in the plot\nas compared to Fig. 10 the prominent features remain. In\nparticular we note that old and metal-rich stars remain in\nroughly equal numbers proving the reality of such stars.\n\n\f8\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 10. The age-metallicity plot of all\nstars with \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5 and MV < 4.4. 5828\nstars were included.\n\nFig. 11. The age-metallicity diagram for\nall stars with \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5, MV < 4.4, and\nE(b \u2212 y) < 0.005. 716 stars were included.\n\n3.2. The F, G and K dwarf stars\nFigure 12 shows the HR-diagram for all the stars in Fig.\n10. The major spectral classes are also indicated. Although\nthe majority of the stars are turn-off stars we also still include a few stars that are tending towards the giant branch\n(i.e. 4.4 < MV < 2 and lg Teff < 3.7) as well as a number of\nstars at 2 < MV and lg Teff < 3.75. We note that the latter\nstars all have very young ages, i.e. these are the stars that\nmake up the small concentration of stars at \u03c4mean \u223c 0.5\nand around [Me/H] = 0.05 dex in Fig. 10. When strong\nconstraints on the reddening is imposed these stars are\nvirtually all excluded. We let these stars remain in the\n\nsample for now. The stars that are close to the bottom\nof the giant branch all have ages larger than 10 Gyr and\nscatter around \u22120.1 dex. Some of these will remain also\nwhen stronger constraints are set on the reddening. We\nkeep also these stars in the full sample. There are also a\nfew stars that appear \"below\" the main-sequence. These\nare the most metal-poor stars in our sample.\nDifferent types of selection effects are amply illustrated\nin Fig. 13 where we compare the age-metallicity plots of\nseveral subsamples of Fig. 10. The stars are divided into\nsub-groups through their effective temperature. The subgroups have been chosen as to emphasize the important\n\n\fSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\ndifferences. Figure 13 a shows the stars with the highest\neffective temperatures, log Teff > 3.83. These are all early\nF stars. Their age-metallicity plot shows a narrow feature\nwith age and metallicity well correlated. Figure 13 b shows\nstars in a lower temperature range, 3.83 \u2265 log Teff > 3.8.\nThere is still a strong correlation between age and metallicity. If this was the stellar sample we had selected for\na study of the age-metallicity relation we would derive\na rather steep and strong correlation between age and\nmetallicity. This is basically a late F star sample.\nFigure 13 c and d show perhaps the most interesting selection effects. Figure 13 c is essentially a sample\ncentered around spectral class G0, 3.8 \u2265 log Teff > 3.77,\nwhile Fig. 13 d shows the same stars but also adds cooler\nG dwarf stars, 3.8 \u2265 log Teff > 3.75. If the first sample had been our chosen stars we would derive a fairly\nstrong one-to-one relation between age and metallicity. If\nthe larger sample was added, the scatter would have been\nincreased, although the error in the mean would be lower\nas more stars were added, and a somewhat shallower agemetallicity relation derived.\nFinally, Fig. 13 e shows all stars cooler than log Teff =\n3.75. This includes not only dwarfs, compare the HRdiagram, but also the brightest evolved stars discussed\nin the first paragraph of this section. These stars all have\nyoung ages and are tracers of a stellar population, i.e. stars\nearlier than \u223c F0, that is excluded from this study due\nto the limitations of the calibration of Teff . These stars\nappear in the age-metallicity plot as the small concentration of stars with around solar metallicities and have the\nlowest ages of all.\nThe most important conclusion that we reach from\nstudying Fig. 13 is that as we allow cooler and cooler\nstars to enter our sample the upper right-hand corner of\nthe age-metallicity plot is progressively filled in. This can\nbe understood by considering the stellar isochrones in e.g.\nFig. 15. As is illustrated there stellar isochrones of more\nmetal-rich stars have a redder as well as fainter turn-off\nfor a given age than more metal-poor stars. This means\nthat metal-rich, old stars are excluded from the sample if\nwe for example set the cut in log Teff at \u223c3.75. The exact\nlimits vary with metallicity. Also remember that the stellar\nsample we are discussing here only includes stars that have\nMV < 4.4.\nAnother illustration of selection effects is shown in Fig.\n14. In this figure we plot the ages and metallicities for different bins of MV . A similar pattern as in Fig. 13 appears,\nbut now the progress from a young, confined population\nto a spread out is found by going to fainter and fainter\nsamples. The selection effect is perhaps most striking in\nthe last sub-plot where stars with 4.4 < MV < 4 are\nshown. This apparently strange selection effect is purely\ndue to the fact that it becomes progressively harder to derive the stellar age as we move down in magnitude. Thus\nthese stars are simply excluded through our criteria for\na good stellar age. That the effect stops at younger ages\nfor metal-rich stars than for metal-poor once again can be\nunderstood from considering the stellar isochrones in e.g.\n\n9\n\nFig. 15. From this figure we see that the isochrones in the\nband of absolute magnitudes between 4 and 4.4 are overall\nmore closely packed for the metal-poor isochrones (i.e. the\nlower panel) than in the panel showing stellar isochrones\nwith solar metallicities. This means that the stellar ages\nderived from fitting of evolutionary tracks necessarily will\nbe more uncertain, and indeed as illustrated in Fig. 14\nno stars in our sample which are in this faintest bins and\nhave an age smaller than \u223c 10 Gyr get an age estimate\nthat has \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5.\nFrom these investigations we conclude that the exact\ndefinition of the stellar sample is of the highest importance. It thus appears unlikely that a stellar sample of\nthe solar neighbourhood can be defined such that the true\nage-metallicity plane is well sampled.\nIn studies of the age-metallicity plot and in the subsequent derivation of an age-metallicity relation the volume\ncompleteness of the sample is of prime importance. For\nour sample no selection according to distance was made.\nThe important question is thus how this influences the\nage-metallicity plot that we have presented e.g. in Figs.\n10 and 11.\nFor our final sample it is virtually impossible to assess\nthe completeness due to the complex route taken to arrive\nat the final sample. That is we only include stars with uvby\nwhich also have a relative error in the parallax less than\n0.25. Finally we impose a cut in the relative errors of the\nderived ages.\nThus, instead of trying to define a subsample that is\nvolume complete we will select stars with E(b\u2212y) < 0.005\nand divide that sample according to the distance. This\nsample has a minimum of error sources for their age and\nmetallicity determinations (see previous investigation of\neffect from E(b\u2212y)). The distributions of distances for our\nfull sample and that for stars with negligible reddening are\nshown in Fig. 16.\nThe age distributions we find for different distance intervals in our sample are essentially flat, Fig. 17. All distance bins show large and roughly similar scatter at all,\nand especially old, ages. We note that the relative number\nof young stars increases with distance. This is due to the\nfact that they are intrinsically bright and we are thus able\nto sample them better than the older, fainter stars. We\nalso note that in the last distance bin the old stars have a\nsomewhat lower mean metallicity than in the other bins.\nThis is due to the fact that metal-poor stars, for the same\nage, are intrinsically brighter than the metal-rich ones and\ncan thus be sampled more completely at larger distances.\nTo complete the characterization of our sample we\nalso show the distributions of [Fe/H] for four different age\nranges in Fig. 18. The first bin contains all stars younger\nthan 2.5 Gyr and has <[Me/H]>= \u22120.044 with \u03c3 equal\nto 0.19 dex. The second bin contains all stars between 2.5\nand 5 Gyr old and has <[Me/H]>= \u22120.13 with \u03c3 equal\nto 0.20 dex. Third bin shows the stars between 5 and 10\nGyr and has <[Me/H]>= \u22120.11 with \u03c3 equal to 0.26 dex,\nwhile the final bin contains all stars older than 10 Gyr and\n\n\f10\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 12. The HR-diagram of all stars with \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5 and\nn\u2265 2. The major spectral class divisions are also indicated\n(taken from Binney & Merrifield 1998).\nhas <[Me/H]>= \u22120.31 and a \u03c3 of 0.33 dex. All bins only\ncontain stars with MV < 4.4 and \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264 0.5.\nFrom this we may conclude that indeed the mean\nmetallicity in the local stellar disk is high for all ages and\nthat the scatter in metallicity at all ages also is high. It\nis also worth noting that the scatter in metallicity at the\nhighest ages cannot be due to an over-estimate of the reddening correction, see Sect. 3.1 and Fig. 11, and hence we\nmay conclude that the scatter we see is a viable representation of the underlying true metallicity distribution and\nthat, most importantly, the scatter is at least as large as\nseen in diagram d of Fig. 18.\n\n4. Discussion \u2013 Does a unique age-metallicity\nrelation exist?\nThe previous sections presented the resulting agemetallicity plot for the solar neighbourhood using 5828\nstars with well determined ages and metallicities. We also\nshowed how different selection criteria may bias the final\nconclusions. We will now proceed with a discussion of previous major determinations of the age-metallicity diagram\navailable in the literature as well as to put our results into\nthe context of the galactic chemical evolution.\nThe most influential studies of the age-metallicity relation are perhaps Twarog (1980b) and Edvardsson et al.\n(1993). The selection of stellar samples as well as the resulting conclusions in the two papers are quite different\nand merits a closer look.\nTwarog (1980a, 1980b) selected a stellar sample of F\ndwarf stars. Twarog (1980b) used a combined sample of\ncarefully selected stars from both the Michigan catalogue\n\nFig. 13. Age-metallicity plots of different sub-samples\nfrom Fig. 10 and Fig. 12. a stars with log Teff > 3.83,\nb stars with 3.83 \u2265 log Teff > 3.8, c stars with 3.8 \u2265\nlog Teff > 3.77, d stars with 3.8 \u2265 log Teff > 3.75, e stars\nwith 3.75 \u2265 log Teff . For clarity we only show [Me/H]> \u22121.\nAll stars have, as before, MV < 4.4 and \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264 0.5\nand n\u2265 2\nas well as using the sample by Gr\u00f8nbech & Olsen (1976,\n1977). The stellar uvby \u2212 \u03b2 photometry was later reanalyzed in detail by Meusinger et al. (1991) using a revised\ncalibration of stellar metallicity and new stellar isochrones\nfrom VandenBerg (1985). The total, combined sample included 536 stars (Meusinger et al. 1991). Meusinger et al.\n(1991) derived an age-metallicity relation similar to that\nof Twarog (1980b) which reflects the preconception that\noverall metallicity increases with time.\nWhat are the biases in the stellar sample defined by\nTwarog (1980b)? First the sample is limited in apparent\nmagnitude. Both Twarog (1980b) as well as Meusinger\net al. (1991) corrected for this incompleteness when calculating the mean [Me/H] for each age bin by weighting\nthe [Me/H] for each star by the inverse volume that that\nparticular star would be visible in given its absolute magnitude. Secondly Twarog (1980b) found, through simulations, that the cuts in effective temperature should not\ninfluence the derived age-metallicity relation. Our new investigation into the effects of different cuts in effective\ntemperature from an sample \u223c6 times larger than was\n\n\fSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 14. Age-metallicity plots of different sub-samples\nfrom Fig. 10 and Fig. 12. a stars with MV < 2, b stars\nwith 2 \u2264 MV < 3, c stars with 3 \u2264 MV < 4, d stars with\n4 \u2264 MV < 4.4. All stars have, as before \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264 0.5\nand n\u2265 2\n\navailable to Twarog shows that indeed the exact cut-off\nat the cooler temperature does have large effects on the\nappearance of the age-metallicity plot, Fig. 13. In particular old, metal-rich stars can be excluded from the sample\nthrough the lower cut in effective temperature.\nIn Fig. 19 we show the distributions of effective temperatures for the sample studied by Meusinger et al.\n(1991). Although the lower cut in effective temperature is\nlow enough that potential old, metal-rich stars would be\nincluded the number of such stars is very small. We also\ncompare these distributions with those of our final sample.\nAlso, again, study the plots in Fig. 13 which shows the\neffect of excluding, voluntarily or un-voluntarily, colder\nstars. In summary the Twarog (1980b) and Meusinger et\nal. (1991) sample suffer from the type of selection effect\nthat we illustrate in Fig. 13.\nAlthough the age-metallicity relations derived by\nTwarog (1980b) and Meusinger et al. (1991) were successfully corrected for the magnitude bias it is apparent\nthat if no metal-rich old stars were present in the original stellar sample then no matter what weighting schemes\nwere invoked these stars would never be accounted for.\n\n11\n\nFig. 15. Theoretical isochrones from Bertelli et al. (1994)\nillustrating the different turn-off colours for metallicities\nas indicated as well as the regions where stellar isochrones\nbecome too closely packed as to prohibit determinations\nof stellar ages\n\nThe Edvardsson et al. (1993) sample was, as described\nin detail in their article, chosen in order to study the chemical evolution of the stellar disk in the Galaxy. The stars\nwere selected from the uvby \u2212\u03b2 catalogue by Olsen (1983).\nThis catalogue contains nearly all F stars brighter than\nV=8.3. In nine metallicity bins, covering the metallicities\nof the galactic disk, 20 slightly evolved dwarf stars were\nchosen (for each bin) for detailed spectroscopic abundance\nanalysis, giving an even coverage in [Fe/H]. Thus the\nmetallicity distribution of that sample is not representative for the stellar populations of the solar neighbourhood\nas it will necessarily include more metal-poor stars than\nare truly present as compared to metal-rich. They found\nan age-metallicity plot which showed an overall trend such\nthat younger stars were preferentially metal-rich while\nold stars were preferentially metal-poor. However, once\nselection biases were corrected for the remaining agemetallicity relation is virtually flat between \u223c 2 \u2212 10 Gyr\nand has a \u03c3 [Fe/H]= 0.20 dex. Perhaps the most important point about the Edvardsson et al. (1993) study is\n\n\f12\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nFig. 16. Histogram of the distances for stars in our final\nsample (full line) and for the sub-sample of stars that have\nE(b \u2212 y) < 0.005\nthe high degree of internal consistency in the derived stellar abundances. In particular the small internal error on\n[Fe/H] which is \u2264 0.05 dex. This means that the scatter\nfound in the age-metallicity plot is four times larger than\nthe internal error on [Fe/H] indicating that part of, or all,\nthe scatter is real and not due to measurement errors, e.g.\nNissen (1995). Furthermore, Chen et al. (2000) applied a\nsimilar abundance analysis to 90 F and G dwarf stars in\nthe solar neighbourhood and found an equally large scatter in [Fe/H]. For example at 10 Gyr they find a differences\nin [Fe/H] of 0.8 dex between co-eval stars. In particular\nthey conclude that there appears to exist metal-rich stars\nof all ages while metal-poor disk stars exclusively have old\nages.\nNg & Bertelli (1998) re-derived the stellar ages for the\nstars in the Edvardsson et al. (1993) sample using updated\nPadua isochrones (Bertelli et al. 1994) and parallaxes measured by Hipparcos (ESA 1997). We have basically used\nthe same method as they did to derive the stellar ages\n(see Sect 2.3). As shown in Sect. 2.3.2 their ages and ours\nagree very well. Ng & Bertelli (1998) found some deviation in derived ages from those presented in Edvardsson et\nal. (1993), however, when the Hipparcos parallaxes were\nrelied upon to determine absolute magnitudes the differences were small. Some evidence for the revised ages to be\nlarger for old ages and somewhat younger for young ages\nwas found but the overall impression and trends seen in\nthe Edvardsson et al. (1993) plot were recaptured.\nGarnett & Kobulnicky (2000) divided the Edvardsson\net al. (1993) sample according to distance. In their Fig. 2\nthey found that stars closer then 30 pc presented a agemetallicity diagram with considerable scatter while the\nstars between 30 and 80 pc appeared to have tighter correlation between age and metallicity. This effect is not\nintrinsic to the stars in the solar neighbourhood but is\nexpected if we consider the way the Edvardsson et al.\nsample was constructed. Since they were doing spectroscopic observations their sample was essentially limited in\n\nFig. 17. Age-metallicity plots of sub-samples in different\ndistance ranges. a stars with d < 25 pc, b stars with\n25 \u2264 d < 50 pc, c stars with 50 \u2264 d < 75 pc, d stars with\n75 \u2264 d < 100 pc, e stars with 100 \u2264 d pc, All stars have,\nas before, MV < 4.4 and \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264 0.5 and n\u2265 2 as well\nas E(b \u2212 y) < 0.005\napparent magnitude. That means those stars that they\nselected that happened to be further away also are intrinsically more bright than those that happened to be\nclose by. Consulting Fig. 14 we observe that when the\nintrinsically less bright stars are excluded then the upperright hand corner gets depleted, i.e. metal-rich, old stars\nare preferentially excluded. Furthermore, Edvardsson et\nal. (1993) strived to have equal numbers of stars in each\nmetallicity bin. As the number density of stars with lower\nmetallicities (i.e. \u223c \u22120.5 to \u22121.0 dex) are smaller than for\nthe more metal-rich stars their sample naturally included\nmany metal-poor stars that are at a greater distance from\nthe sun. We can thus see how these two factors conspire\nto form a sample where metal-poor, old stars would preferentially be found in the sub-sample further away from\nus while the metal-rich old stars would be excluded from\nthat sub-sample. Thus the diagrams presented by Garnett\n& Kobulnicky (2000) can naturally be explained as part\nof the sample construction and may not be inherent to the\nstars in general in the solar neighbourhood.\nThe major conclusion from the Edvardsson et al.\n(1993) study and the Ng & Bertelli(1998) study was\n\n\fSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\n13\n\nFig. 19. Histogram showing the distribution of effective temperatures for the stars in Fig. 10. The small,\nshaded histogram shows the distribution for the sample in\nMeusinger et al. (1991) (reproduced after their Fig. 1b).\n\nFig. 18. Histograms for four age-ranges, a stars with ages\nless than 2.5 Gyr, b ages between 2.5 and 5 Gyr, c ages\nbetween 5 and 10 Gyr, and finally d ages larger than 10\nGyr. Note the different ranges on the y-axes, each tick\nmark, in each separate panel, corresponds to a unit of 50\nstars. All stars have, as before, MV < 4.4 and \u03c3\u03c4 /\u03c4mean \u2264\n0.5 and n\u2265 2.\nthat there does indeed exist a large spread in the agemetallicity plot. So large that in fact the internal measurement errors cannot account for it. In particular they\nfound that there exist old, metal-rich stars. This is further\nsupported by Chen et al. (2000) and Feltzing & Gonzalez\n(2001), as well as by the new, larger data sample presented\nhere.\nWe have already extensively compared our results with\nthose of Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000). The distribution in\nb \u2212 y, from Fig. 1a in Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000) shows that\ntheir sample basically contains stars from 6000 K down\nto 4500 K, although the sampling becomes progressively\npatchier at the lower temperatures. Thus they should not\nsuffer from selection effects in the same way as the Twarog\nsample did and they should in fact have included old,\n\nmetal-rich stars. Our main concern with this work and\nthe validity of the age-metallicity relation derived stems\nfrom our investigation of the derivation of chromospheric\nages, see Sect. 2.3.3.\nSeveral models of Galactic chemical evolution have reproduced the scatter observed in Edvardsson et al. (1993)\nand Ng & Bertelli (1998), e.g. Pilyugin & Edmunds (1996),\nRaiteri et al. (1996), and Berczik (1999). The two latter\nmodels take into account not only the chemical enrichment as time goes but also the dynamical evolution of\nthe system, while the first model in particular studies the\neffect of irregular rates of infall of un-processed matter\nonto the stellar disk. Both approaches create a significant\nscatter in the age-metallicity plot supporting our conclusion that the observed scatter is real and not a result of\nobservational errors.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have presented stellar ages and metallicities for 5828\ndwarf and sub-dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood.\nThese were used to study the age-metallicity diagram of\nthe local stellar disk. Because of the size of the sample,\nto our best knowledge so far the largest sample for which\nsuch data has been presented, we were able to study, in\ndetail, the effects of different selection criteria on the agemetallicity diagram and the conclusions drawn from such\ndiagrams.\nIn particular we find that the solar neighbourhood agemetallicity diagram is well populated at at all ages and especially that old, metal-rich stars do exist. Further, that\n\n\f14\n\nSofia Feltzing et al.: The solar neighbourhood age-metallicity relation - does it exist?\n\nexclusion of colder stars lead to a loss of old, metal-rich\nstars. The reason for this can be found in the stellar evolutionary tracks themselves. Old, metal-rich stars have to\nbe fairly evolved for stellar isochrones of different ages to\nbe sufficiently separated in order to allow a reliable age\ndetermination. Thus it is of utmost importance when selecting a representative stellar sample to include such cold\nstars.\nFurther, we found that the scatter in metallicity at any\ngiven age are larger than the observational error, in concordance with Edvardsson et al. (1993). We also discuss\nhow the distance dependence that Garnett & Kobulnicky\n(2000) found in age-metallicity diagram of the Edvardsson\net al. (1993) sample is an expected effect of the construction of their sample.\nThe difference between our [Me/H] derived from uvby\nphotometry as compared with the spectroscopic [Fe/H]\nderived by Edvardsson et al. (1993) is +0.01 \u00b1 0.10 dex.\nAcknowledgements. Lennart Lindegren is acknowledged for extensive, fruitful discussions with SF and JH. The authours\nwould like to thank the referee, W.J.
