In these works physical\nparameters (lattice mismatch or surface tension) which\ndiffer between the substrate and film were smoothly varied over the substrate-film interface in order to avoid nonanalyticities. The effect of such smoothing was to create\na wetting layer. Whilst the choice of a smoothing length\nof the order of a lattice parameter is physically reasonable, none of these works gave a physical explanation for\nthe smoothing of material parameters over the interface\nor tried to physically calculate the smoothing length or\nform of the transition.\nThe research in the second category typically used\nphysically motivated methods in order to determine the\nfree energy of a flat film of varying depth. Tersoff [13]\nand Roland and Gilmer [16] both used empirical potential\nmethods to determine the chemical energy of flat films\nof Ge/Si(001). Tersoff [13] then compared this chemical potential with that of a bulk strained Ge in order to\ndetermine whether it is preferable to form islands and\nto predict a wetting layer of 3 monolayers. Roland and\nGilmer [16] saw some evidence of clustering in thicker\nfilms in molecular dynamics simulations. Daruka and\nBarabasi [14] used an expression for the free energy of a\nflat film of varying depths which fits the results of the\nearlier works [13,16] in order to compare the energies of\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe growth of epitaxially strained thin films in which\nthere is lattice mismatch between the substrate and the\nfilm is of major importance in the fabrication of semiconductor and optoelectronic devices. The lattice mismatch\ngenerates strain in the deposited film, which can cause\nfilm instability unfavorable to uniform flat film growth.\nThe strained film can relax either by the introduction of\ndislocations or by the formation of coherent (dislocationfree) islands on the film surface via surface diffusion.\nThese coherent islands can self-organize to create periodic arrays which can be utilized to create quantum dot\nstructures of electronic significance. Understanding and\npredicting strained thin-film evolution is important for\nthe improved fabrication of semiconductor devices.\nEarly film growth tends to occur via coherent island\nformation as there is an energy barrier to the introduction of dislocations. Dislocations occur at island edges\nonce islands reach a certain size as the large stress at\nisland edges provides a pathway for dislocation formation [1]. We only consider dislocation-free films since\nmany experiments show an absence of dislocations (see\ne.g [1,2]) especially in early film evolution.\nThe current work sheds light on the following two problems: First, it has been observed experimentally that\ndislocation-free flat films of less than a certain thickness (the critical wetting layer) are stable to surface perturbations, while thicker films are unstable [2\u201310]. The\nthickness of the wetting layer is substance dependent and\ndecreases with increasing lattice mismatch strain [6\u201310],\n\u03b5 = (as \u2212 af )/af , where as and af are the substrate\nand film lattice constants. Above the critical wetting\nlayer, 3D coherent islands form. Despite considerable efforts the physics of the critical wetting layer is poorly\nunderstood. Namely, why is there a critical, stable wetting layer and what controls its thickness? As in most\n1\n\n\fflat films and films with fully faceted islands whose energies were calculated using continuum elasticity. They\nsaw a wetting layer which increased with decreasing lattice mismatch. Wang et al. [15] used ab initio methods\nin order to determine the formation energy of flat films\nof varying depths of InAs/GaAs(100). They compared\nthis energy with that of a thinner film with fully faceted\nislands whose energies were calculated using continuum\nelasticity. All the above works did not study the issue\nof when a flat film becomes unstable to small monolayer\nperturbations or the dynamics of growth.\nIn this paper we show that the variation of nonlinear\nelastic free energy with film thickness can give rise to\na wetting layer which decreases with increasing lattice\nmismatch strain. We show how and at what depth a flat\nfilm becomes unstable to perturbations of varying size\nfor films with both isotropic and anisotropic surface tension. This provides a more realistic estimate of critical\nwetting layer thickness than the studies described above,\nfor films in which islands grow from small surface perturbations rather than being immediately nucleated on the\nflat film. This mode of growth has been seen in many\nexperimental systems [7\u20139,17], especially for films with\nsmall lattice mismatch, \u03b5 < 2.5%. As discussed below we\nstudy the evolution of these small perturbations and observe island faceting. We show that anisotropic surface\ntension gives rise to a metastable enlarged wetting layer.\nThe perturbation amplitude needed to destabilize this\nwetting layer decreases with increasing lattice mismatch.\nThe effects of material deposition on early thin film\nevolution was addressed by Chiu and Gao [11] who looked\nat the evolution of strained films with isotropic surface\ntension when material deposition is constant in the direction perpendicular to the film surface, corresponding\nto liquid phase epitaxy. In the present paper we look at\nthin film growth when material deposition is constant in\nthe direction perpendicular to the film surface and when\ndeposition is at a steady rate in the y direction (vertical to the interface between the film and the substrate),\ncorresponding to any directed deposition (e.g, molecular beam epitaxy). The latter is a much more common\nmethod of material deposition in strained film growth.\nWe found that the type of evolution seen depends on the\ndirection of material deposition. When the deposition is\nconstant in the vertical y-direction, the film evolves according to the linear evolution equation, even after the\nsurface is no longer a sine function and cusp formation\noccurs. When deposition is constant perpendicular to\nthe surface, cusp formation is slowed down at very high\ndeposition rates and the surface shows signs of reaching a\nsteady-state morphology. We also studied thin film evolution for faceting films, and found robust scaling laws\nfor film growth.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec.\nII we formulate the problem. In Sec. III we present the\ngeneral results of linear stability analysis. In Sec. IV we\n\ndescribe how we calculated the variation of the nonlinear\nelastic free energy of a flat film with film thickness. It is\nthis variation which gives rise to the wetting layer. Calculations were carried out using a ball and spring model\nin order to determine general qualitative behaviour. Sec.\nV describes the results of the numerical simulations of\nthin film evolution without material deposition, and in\nparticular the metastability of the wetting layer. Sec. VI\ndescribes the results of the numerical simulations of thin\nfilm growth with material deposition. Some of the results on thin film growth without deposition and a brief\ndescription of the ball-and-spring model for calculating\nthe free energy of a flat film appear in our earlier paper\n[18].\nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\n\nWe model the evolution of a thin film on a substrate\nusing continuum theory. The lattice mismatch between\nthe film and the substrate creates a strain in the film,\n\u03b5 . Both the substrate and the film are assumed to be\nelastically isotropic with the same elastic constants. The\nsurface of the solid is at y = h(x, t) and the film is in\nthe y > 0 region with the film-substrate interface at\ny = 0. The system is modelled to be invariant in the\nz-direction, and all quantities are calculated for a section\nof unit width in that direction. This is consistent with\nplane strain where the solid extends infinitely in the z\ndirection and hence all strains in this direction vanish,\ni.e. exz = eyz = ezz = 0. We assume there is no material\nmixing between the substrate and the film.\nAll the results mentioned in this paper relate to vicinal\nsurfaces with a very small miscut angle in the z direction\n(see Fig. 1). Experimentally, surfaces often have such a\nsmall miscut, as it is very difficult to grow a perfect facet.\nIn such surfaces there is no finite energy barrier for the\nformation of an infinitesimal perturbation on the surface,\nsince such a perturbation involves only step motion and\nbending, and no nucleation of new steps. For a faceted\nsurface with no miscut in the z direction there is a finite energy barrier for the formation of an infinitesimal\nperturbation associated with nucleation of step pairs.\nThe continuum approximation in the lateral direction\n(x \u2212 z plane) is valid as the film is infinite in the z direction and the smallest lateral surface features we study\nhave widths of tens of atoms. However in the vertical y\ndirection the films we are studying are sometimes only\na few monolayers thick. Is the continuum model valid\nfor such a film? Can inherently discrete system properties, such as the change in free energy as a monolayer is\nadded, be interpolated to films of a non-integer number\nof monolayers?\n\n2\n\n\fvicinal surface\n\nwhere Ds is the surface diffusion coefficient, s is the arc\nlength, T is the temperature, kB is Boltzmann's constant\nand \u03bc is the chemical potential at the surface; i.e. it is the\nincrease in free energy when an atom is added to the solid\nsurface at the point of interest. Taking the divergence of\nthe surface current produced by the atom drift gives an\nexpression for the surface movement [19]\n\nperturbed vicinal surface\n\nperturbed faceted surface\n\nfully faceted surface\n\n\u2202h\nDs \u03b7\u03a9 \u2202 \u2202\u03bc\n=\n,\n\u2202t\nkB T \u2202x \u2202s\n\n(2)\n\ny\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the number of atoms per unit area on the solid\nsurface and \u03a9 is the atomic volume.\nIn the continuum approximation \u03bc = \u03a9 \u03b4F\n\u03b4h , where F is\nthe free energy of the solid and \u03b4F/\u03b4h is the functional\nderivative of F . The free energy is composed of elastic\nand surface terms:\nZ\np\nF = Fel + dx \u03b3 1 + (\u2202h/\u2202x)2 ,\n(3)\n\nx\nz\n\nn+1/2 monolayers\n\nn monolayers\ny\n\ny\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the surface tension and Fel is the elastic free\nenergy including any elastic contributions to the surface\ntension.\nIn general the elastic free energy can be written as\n(0)\n(0)\nFel = Fel + \u03b4Fel , where Fel is the elastic free energy\nof a zero strain reference state. The elastic free energy\ncan be written\nR in terms of the elastic free energy density,\nfv , as Fel = dxdyfv . fv is expanded as a power series\n(0)\n(0)\nin the strain: fv = fv + \u03c3ij eij + 21 cijkl eij ekl + * * *,\n\nx\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1. Perturbations of vicinal and fully faceted surfaces.\nThe dotted lines represent the cross-sections taken in the xy\nplane which are shown in the bottom graphs. The figure\nshows that nucleation of new steps is needed in order to perturb a facet, but not in order to perturb a surface vicinal in\nthe z direction.\n\n(0)\n\nwhere fv is the free energy density in the zero strain\n(0)\nreference state, \u03c3ij is the stress in the reference state and\ncijkl are the elastic coefficients of the material. In linear\nelasticity theory, deformations are assumed to be small\nand so terms of third order and higher are neglected. The\n\u2202fv\n, which\nstress-strain relationship is given by \u03c3ij = \u2202e\nij\nunder linear elasticity gives Hooke's law:\n\nFirst, consider fully faceted films. As can be seen in\nFig. 1 there is a qualitative difference between films with\ninteger and non-integer numbers of monolayers, and so\ndiscrete system properties cannot be interpolated to films\nwith a non-integer number of monolayers. Hence for such\nfilms continuum models are not expected to give accurate\nresults. To accurately model fully faceted film growth,\nthe discrete nature of the steps needs to be taken into account using atomistic models and simulations. Modeling\nlarge systems in such a manner is currently beyond computational capabilities. However, as can be seen in Fig.\n1, the above arguments do not apply to vicinal surfaces.\nIn this case a perturbation changes the morphology in a\nsmooth manner without any nucleation of steps. Therefore it is possible to estimate the properties of films with\na non-integer number of monolayers by interprolating the\nresults of films of integer numbers of monolayers. Thus,\na continuum model should adequately describe thin film\ngrowth behaviour for slightly vicinal surfaces.\nWe assume that surface diffusion is the dominant mass\ntransport mechanism. Gradients in the chemical potential produce a drift of surface atoms with an average velocity, v, given by the Nernst-Einstein relation\nv=\u2212\n\nDs \u2202\u03bc\n,\nkB T \u2202s\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c3ij = \u03c3ij + cijkl ekl .\n\n(4)\n\nWe now briefly describe the equations which need to be\nsatisfied in order to completely determine the equilibrium\nstress and strain in an elastic body. An elastic solid must\nsatisfy the equations of mechanical equilibrium at every\npoint in its interior (see e.g. [20]):\n\u2202j \u03c3ij + \u03bei = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bei is an external force on the solid. The solid must\nalso satisfy the equations of equilibrium at its surface,\n\u03c3ij nj = Tin ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere n is the exterior normal, and T n is the external\nforce acting on the unit area surface element with normal\nn. As the strains eij are not independent but are linked\nvia the displacements of the elastic body, they must also\nsatisfy the equations of compatibility:\n\n(1)\n\n3\n\n\f\u2202k \u2202l eij + \u2202i \u2202j ekl = \u2202j \u2202l eik + \u2202i \u2202k ejl .\n\n(0)\n\nEqs. (5),(6) and (7) along with the stress-strain relationships (4) give us a system of equations, which are\nsufficient for the complete determination of the equilibrium stress and strain in an elastic body.\nFor the system we study, external body forces (e.g.\ngravity) are neglected. Hence Eq. (5) becomes\n\u2202j \u03c3ij = 0\n\nfor y < h(x).\n\n(8)\n\nOur system has periodic boundary conditions in the x\ndirection and is infinite in the negative y direction. We\nshall assume that the forces on the upper surface due\nto surface tension (as given by Marchenko and Parshin\n[21]) are negligible in comparison to the forces due to\nthe mismatch stress. This assumption is fulfilled as long\n\u03b3\nas R\n\u226a M \u03b5 where R is the radius of curvature of the\nsurface and M is the plane strain modulus. For typical\nvalues of \u03b3, M and \u03b5, this condition is satisfied when\nR is larger than the lattice constant. As typical surface\nfeatures have length scales of the order of 100nm this\nassumption is valid. Hence the boundary conditions are\ngiven by\n\u03c3ij nj = 0\n\u03c3ij \u2192 0\n\nat\nwhen\n\ny = h(x)\ny \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n\n(0)\n\nlinear elasticity gives \u03c3ij = M \u03b5 and fv = M \u03b52 /2,\nwhere M is the plane strain modulus. Therefore, variation of the elastic free energy and stress of a flat film with\nfilm height is a nonlinear phenomenon, and a model outside of linear elasticity theory must be used to calculate\nthem. As will be shown in Section. III, small variations\nin the reference free energy density with film thickness\nare crucial in predicting wetting layer thickness, and a\nreference free energy density which has no variation with\nfilm thickness will lead to thin films that have no wetting\nlayer.\nThe disadvantage of our choice of the reference state\nis that the dependence of h on x leads to lateral variations of the reference state. As a result, the reference\nstress does not satisfy the condition of mechanical equilibrium. However, the needed corrections vanish in the\nlimit a/\u03bb \u2192 0, where a is the length scale over which\nstress varies in the y-direction and \u03bb is the lateral length\nof typical surface structures. This is because in this limit\nthere are no lateral variations in the reference stress. As\ntypical experimental islands have \u03bb \u223c 100nm, and as a is\nof the order of the lattice constant (see below), the corrections to the reference stress are small and have been\nignored.\nThough linear elasticity cannot be used to calculate properties associated with the reference state, it\ncan still be used to find the correction to the elastic\nfree energy of the perturbed state, \u03b4Fel . For convenience we work in terms of the reference elastic free\n(0)\nenergy per unit length in the x-direction, fel (h(x)) \u2261\nR h(x)\n(0)\ndyfv (h(x), y), instead of the free energy per unit\n\u2212\u221e\nvolume. According\nto linear elasticity\ntheory, \u03b4Fel =\n\u0011\nR\nR h(x) \u0010 (0)\n1\ndx \u2212\u221e dy \u03c3ij eij + 2 cijkl eij ekl . In terms of the\nstress tensor, we find\n\n(7)\n\n(9)\n\nWe now return to our discussion on the determination\nof the elastic free energy of both the reference state and\nthe perturbed state. For each value of x, our reference\nstate corresponds locally to a flat film of thickness h(x)\nconstrained to have theR lateral\nconstant of the\nR h(x)lattice\n(0)\n(0)\nsubstrate; i.e., Fel = dx \u2212\u221e dyfv (h(x), y), where\n(0)\n\nfv (h(x), y) is the elastic free energy density of a flat\nfilm of thickness h(x) with the substrate lateral lattice\nconstant. We calculate the correction to the elastic free\nenergy of the perturbed state, \u03b4Fel , using linear elasticity\ntheory.\nWhen looking at the stability of a strained flat film of\nthickness C, the obvious first choice for a reference state\nis that of a flat film of thickness C constrained to have the\nlateral lattice constant of the substrate. For later calculations we must fully define the reference state and hence\n(0)\nneed to know its stress \u03c3ij (C, y) and free energy density\n\nFel =\n\nR\n\n(0)\n\ndx fel +\n\u0013\nZ h(x) \u0012\nR\n1\n1\n(0) (0)\ndy\ndx\nSijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl \u2212 Sijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl , (10)\n2\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere we have used the inverted Hooke's law eij =\n(0)\nSijkl (\u03c3kl \u2212 \u03c3kl ). Sijkl are the compliance coefficients\nof the material.\nUsing Eqs. (3) and (10) we arrive at an expression for\n\u03b4F/\u03b4h\n\n(0)\n\nfv (C, y). One simple approach to calculate these quantities would be to use linear elasticity with the unstressed\nfilm as a reference state. In linear elasticity a flat film\nof any thickness constrained to have the substrate lateral\nlattice constant and free to move in the y direction is in\nequilibrium and has the elastic free energy density of an\ninfinitely strained film. Hence such a calculation does not\n(0)\n(0)\npredict any C or y dependence in \u03c3ij and fv except for\na step function at the film-substrate interface. For example in the case of plane strain where the mismatch strain\nis uniaxial (i.e., exz = eyz = ezz = 0, exy = 0, exx = \u03b5),\n\n(0)\n\ndfel\n\u03b4F\n=\u03b3\ne(\u03b8)\u03ba +\n\u03b4h\ndh\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n(0) (0)\nSijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl \u2212 Sijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl\n+\n2\n2\ny=h(x)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ h(x)\n\u2202 1\n1\n(0) (0)\n+\ndy\nSijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl \u2212 Sijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl , (11)\n\u2202h 2\n2\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere \u03ba is surface curvature, \u03b8 is the angle between\nthe normal to the surface and the y direction, and\n4\n\n\f\u03b3\ne(\u03b8) = \u03b3(\u03b8) + \u2202 2 \u03b3/\u2202\u03b82 is the surface stiffness. The integrand in Eq. (11) is the change in the linear elastic free\nenergy density as the surface profile changes infinitesimally. Following Sokolnikoff [20] we now show that this\nterm is second order in \u03b4h in the absence of external surface or body forces and so can be neglected. When the\nsurface profile changes, the strain in the body changes\nfrom eij to eij + e\u2032ij , where e\u2032ij is of order \u03b4h. The elastic free energy density can be written as fv + \u2206fv =\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2 cijkl (eij + eij )(ekl + ekl ), and the change in elastic free\nenergy density is \u2206fv = cijkl eij e\u2032kl + 12 cijkl e\u2032ij e\u2032kl . Using\nHooke's law (4), the definition of strain and Eq. (5), we\nrewrite \u2206fv as \u2206fv = \u2202j (\u03c3ij u\u2032i ) + \u03bei u\u2032i + 21 cRijkl e\u2032ij e\u2032kl . The\nRtotaln change\nRin the elasticRfree energy is \u2206fv dxdy =\nTi u\u2032i ds + \u03bei u\u2032i dxdy + 12 cijkl e\u2032ij e\u2032kl dxdy, where the\nfirst term on the r.h.s. is an integral over the film surface. To obtain this we used Eq. (6). In the absence of\nexternal surface or body forces the first two terms on the\nr.h.s of the above\nequation vanish,\nand we are left with\nR\nR\nthe equation \u2206fv dxdy = 12 cijkl e\u2032ij e\u2032kl dxdy. e\u2032ij is of\norder \u03b4h, and hence the last term in Eq. (11) can be\nignored for infinitesimal changes to the solid surface and\nwe have\n\nwhere M is the plane strain modulus. Hence we must determine the stress at the surface of the film. This is done\nby finding the stress which satisfies both the linear elasticity equations (the equations of compatibility(7) and\nequilibrium(8)) and the boundary conditions (9).\nFor an isotropic solid under plane strain, finding the\nstress which satisfies the linear elasticity equations and\nthe boundary conditions can be reduced to finding the\nstress function, W, which satisfies the boundary conditions (9) and the biharmonic equation (see e.g. Timoshenko [22] or Mikhlin [23]):\n\u22062 W = \u2206(\u2206W ) =\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2202 W\nwith \u03c3xx = \u2202\u2202yW2 , \u03c3xy = \u2212 \u2202x\u2202y\nand \u03c3yy = \u2202\u2202xW2 .\nIn order to model the early evolution of faceted islands, and to study the effect of an anisotropic form\nof surface tension on the wetting layer, we used the\ncusped form of surface tension given by Bonzel and\nPreuss [24], which shows faceting in a free crystal: \u03b3(\u03b8) =\n\u03b30 [1 + \u03b2 |sin(\u03c0\u03b8/(2\u03b80 ))|], where \u03b2 \u2248 0.05 and \u03b80 is the\nangle of maximum \u03b3. The value of \u03b30 was taken as 1\nJ/m2 in the substrate and about 75% of that in the film\n(as is the case for Si/Ge). This ensures a wetting layer\nof at least one monolayer. We considered a crystal which\nfacets at 0\u25e6 , \u00b145\u25e6 and \u00b190\u25e6 with \u03b80 = \u03c0/8. The cusp\ngives rise to \u03b3\ne = \u221e. However, a slight miscut of the lowindex surface along the z direction leads to a rounding of\nthe cusp, which can be described by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\n\u03c0\n(14)\n\u03b8) + G\u22122 ,\n\u03b3(\u03b8) = \u03b30 1 + \u03b2 sin2 (\n2\u03b80\n\n(0)\n\ndfel\n\u03b4F\n=\u03b3\ne\u03ba +\n\u03b4h\n\u0012 dh\n\u0013\n1\n1\n(0) (0)\n+\nSijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl \u2212 Sijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl\n2\n2\n\n\u22024W\n\u22024W\n\u22024W\n+\n2\n+\n= 0, (13)\n\u2202x4\n\u2202x2 \u2202y 2\n\u2202y 4\n\n. (12)\ny=h(x)\n\nAs the above equation gives \u03b4F\n\u03b4h at the solid surface, all\nvariables in the equation are also given at the surface. In\n(0)\nparticular \u03c3ij (h, y = h) is taken as the stress at the surface of a flat solid of height h(x) and hence must vanish\n(0)\nwhen h \u2264 0, since then the film is absent. dfel (h)/dh is\ndetermined by calculating how the reference elastic free\nenergy of the solid changes as monolayers are added to\n(0)\nthe solid surface. When h \u2264 0, dfel /dh = 0 as the\nsubstrate is completely relaxed. In principle, Eq. (12)\nshould also contain derivatives of \u03b3 with respect to h.\nHowever, we believe that the variation of surface tension\nwith h away from a step dependence is due to elastic effects. Since we included all elastic contributions in the\nzero-strain elastic free energy, we modeled \u03b3 as a step\nfunction, taking the value of the substrate surface tension for h \u2264 0 and the film surface tension for h > 0.\nThus all partial derivatives of \u03b3 with respect to surface\nheight vanish and were omitted from Eq. (12).\nEquations (2) and (12) form a complete model of surface evolution. In order to solve this model, the chemical\npotential (given by Eq. (12)) for a given surface must be\nfound, and so the linear elastic free energy density at the\nsolid surface, fvlin = 12 Sijkl \u03c3ij \u03c3kl y=h(x) must be calculated. For an isotropic solid under plane strain with zero\nforce boundary conditions the above expression simpli1\n(\u03c3xx + \u03c3yy )2 y=h(x) ,\nfies considerably to give, fvlin = 2M\n\nwhere, for example, G = 500 corresponds to a miscut\nangle, \u2206\u03b8 \u2248 0.1\u25e6 . As mentioned earlier all the results\nmentioned in this paper relate to surfaces with a very\nsmall miscut angle in the z direction.\nIII. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section we carry out a linear stability analysis of\nEq. (2) against a sinusoidal perturbation of wavenumber\nk, similar to that carried out in Ref. [25] for an infinitely\nthick stressed film. We thus look for a height profile of\nthe form, h(x, t) = C + \u03b4(t) sin kx, which solves Eq. (2)\nto first order in \u03b4. To calculate the linear elastic energy\nwe find the solutions of (13), which satisfy the boundary\n(0)\nconditions (9). \u03c3xy vanishes because the film is hydro(0)\nstatically strained, and \u03c3yy = 0 since in the reference\nstate the force on the surface vanishes. Hence the only\n(0)\nnon-zero component of the reference stress is \u03c3xx (h, y).\nStress functions of the form\n(0)\nW = \u03c3xx\n(h, y)y 2 /2 + (A + By)eky sin(kx)\n\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fsatisfy the biharmonic equation. This gives stresses of\nthe form\n\nterm is a surface tension term. Surface tension acts to\nreduce surface curvature, \u03ba, and so this term is negative,\nthereby reducing the perturbation amplitude, and is linear in \u03ba \u223c k 2 . The second term in this equation is a\nmismatch stress term. Regions of high stress have large\nchemical potential, and so atoms tend to detach from\nthese regions and attach to regions of small chemical potential. In a mismatch stressed solid, valleys or cusps\nare regions of high stress, hence material moves from the\nvalleys to the hills of a perturbed surface increasing perturbation amplitude. The contribution of this term is\npropotional to the density of valleys, which is linear in k.\n(0)\nThe last term is a reference state term. If d2 fel /dh2 > 0\nit costs more energy to add a monolayer to a flat film\nthan to remove a monolayer, and hence it costs energy\n(0)\nto perturb a film. Thus, positive d2 fel /dh2 stabilizes a\n(0)\nflat thin film, whereas negative d2 fel /dh2 leads to an\ninstability. Obviously this reference state term is present\neven if the film is flat and hence is independent of k.\nEquation (17) implies that the flat film is stable at all\nperturbation wavelengths as long as\n\n(0)\n\u03c3xx = k[2B + (A + By)k]eky sin(kx) + \u03c3xx\n(h, y)\n\n\u03c3yy = \u2212k 2 (A + By)eky sin(kx)\n\u03c3xy = \u2212k[B + (A + By)k]eky cos(kx).\nTo first order in \u03b4 the stresses that satisfy the biharmonic equation and the boundary conditions are given\nby:\n(0)\n\u03c3xx = \u2212\u03b4ke\u2212kC \u03c3xx\n(C, C)[2 + (y \u2212 C)k]eky sin(kx)\n(0)\n+\u03c3xx\n(h, y)\n(0)\n\u03c3yy = k 2 e\u2212kC \u03c3xx\n(C, C)(y \u2212 C)eky sin(kx)\n(0)\n\u03c3xy = \u03b4ke\u2212kC \u03c3xx\n(C, C)[1 + (y \u2212 C)k]eky cos(kx).\n\nAt the surface these stresses take the form:\n(0)\n\u03c3xx = \u22122\u03b4k\u03c3xx\n(C, C) sin(kx)\n\n\u03c3yy\n\n(0)\n(0)\n+\u03c3xx\n(C, C) + \u03b4 sin(kx)d\u03c3xx\n/dh|h=C\n=0\n\nh\ni4\n(0)\n\u03c3xx (C, C)\n\n(0)\n\u03c3xy = \u03b4k\u03c3xx\n(C, C) cos(kx).\n\nM2\n\nNote that all the derivatives in the Taylor expansions\nused in this analysis are with respect to h, the reference film thickness and not with respect to y, the depth\nwithin the reference film. This is because in calculating the chemical potential we are interested in how the\nfree energy of the film changes as material is added or\nremoved from the film surface; i.e. how the free energy\nof the film changes as the film thickness changes and not\nhow the free energy density of the film varies within the\nfilm.\nUsing the above stresses in Eq. (12), we obtain the\nexpression\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\ndfel\n(C, C),\ndh\n\nd2 fel\ndh2\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nh=C\n\nand the equality holds at the critical wetting layer\nthickness, where perturbations of wavenumber k =\nh\ni2\n(0)\ne0 ) are marginal. \u03b3\ne0 is positive if \u03b8 = 0\n\u03c3xx (C, C) /(M \u03b3\nis a surface seen in the equilibrium free crystal [26]. As\nmentioned earlier \u03b3\ne0 \u2192 \u221e at a perfect facet, and is large\nand positive on a surface with a small miscut, as is the\ncase for most of the materials used in epitaxial films.\nTherefore, a linearly stable wetting layer of finite thick(0)\nness can exist only if d2 fel /dh2 > 0. Note that for\nthe wetting layer to have a finite rather than an infi(0)\nnite thickness, d2 fel /dh2 must decrease to a value less\nthan the l.h.s. of Eq. (18) as the thickness of the film\n(0)\nincreases. \u03c3xx (C, C) depends linearly on the lattice mismatch \u03b5, and hence the l.h.s. of (18) is proportional to\n\u03b54 , while the r.h.s. of (18) is proportional to \u03b52 due to\n(0)\nthe dependence of fel on lattice mismatch. Therefore,\n(0)\nif d2 fel /dh2 > 0, the thickness of the wetting layer increases with decreasing lattice mismatch and diverges in\nthe limit \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nNote that the maximum thickness of a flat film which is\nstable to infinitesimal perturbations is given by (18) when\nthe equality holds. A film slightly thicker is unstable to\nh\ni2\n(0)\nperturbations of wavelength \u03bb = 2\u03c0M \u03b3e0 / \u03c3xx (C, C) .\nFor films which are nearly perfect facets with small miscut angles these wavelengths are larger than the typical sample size and so practically such perturbations will\nnever occur. However as will be explained in Section\nV, the film can be nonlinearly unstable to smaller wave-\n\ndfel\n1\n1\n\u03b4F\n=e\n\u03b3\u03ba +\n+\n(\u03c3xx + \u03c3yy )2 \u2212\n(\u03c3 (0) + \u03c3 (0) )2\n\u03b4h\ndh\"\n2M\n2M xx # yy\n(0)\n(0)\nd2 fel\n(\u03c3xx (C, C))2\n\u2212\n2k\n= \u03b4 sin(kx)\n+\u03b3\ne0 k 2\ndh2\nM\n+\n\n(0)\n\n\u2264\u03b3\ne0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b3\ne0 = e\n\u03b3 (\u03b8 = 0).

Each term in the brackets in this\nequation has a simple physical significance. The first\n6\n\n\flength perturbations of a non-zero amplitude at physically reasonable wavelengths. Hence the inequality in\n(18) is only useful in predicting the stability of films with\nlarge miscut angles or above the roughening temperature.\nAt small miscut angles the stability of the film to large\nperturbations will predict its maximum thickness. This\nissue is discussed in more detail in Section V.\n\nnot imply that the stress-strain relationship of the balland-spring network is linear (a discussion of this point\ncan be found in Feynman's Lectures [28]). The natural\nspring length has a step variation over the interface, and\nthe balls are placed on a lattice with the substrate lattice constant. Thus balls in the substrate are connected\nby springs of their natural length, whereas balls in the\nfilm are connected by springs that have undergone a hydrostatic transformation strain and have length larger\nthan their natural length by a factor of 1 + e, where e\nis the homogeneous strain in the film. The network was\nthen allowed to relax, with the film free to move in the\ny-direction, and periodic boundary conditions being applied in the x-direction to ensure that the system boundaries in this direction were fixed to the natural substrate\nlength.\n(0)\nWe calculated the mismatch stress \u03c3xx within the relaxed film and at the film surface. We also calculated\n(0)\nthe dependence of mismatch surface stress \u03c3xx (h, h) and\n(0)\nthe nonlinear elastic free energy fel (h) on varying film\nthickness, h. We carried out these calculations for various\ntwo dimensional networks of balls and springs with varying spring constants. An example of the ball-and-spring\nmodel on a fcc-like lattice is shown in Fig. (2).\n\nIV. CALCULATION OF THE NONLINEAR\nELASTIC FREE ENERGY OF A FLAT FILM\n\nAs can be seen from both Eq. (12) and Eq. (18), the\ndependence of the nonlinear elastic free energy of a flat\n(0)\nfilm fel (h) on film thickness, h, is vital in order to determine both wetting layer thickness and thin film evolution. This free energy depends strongly on the mismatch\n(0)\nstress \u03c3ij , and its dependence on the y coordinate. As\na result of the sharp interface between the substrate and\n(0)\nthe film, we expect \u03c3ij to behave as a step function of\ny with small corrections due to elastic relaxation. If we\nignore these small corrections, the resulting free energy\n(0)\nfel (h) is proportional to film thickness, and its second\nderivative vanishes. Hence according to Eq. (18), the\nthickness of the critical wetting layer vanishes. The correction due to elastic relaxation is therefore extremely\nimportant. As discussed earlier, this correction vanishes\nwithin linear elasticity theory. This led some investigators [27] to claim that the variation in free energy over the\ninterface was due to nonelastic effects, e.g. film-substrate\nmaterial mixing over the interface. However, we claim\nthat this is not necessary, since nonlinear elasticity can\nexplain the corrections to the step-function form of the\nfree energy.\nThe nonlinear elastic free energy of the reference state,\n(0)\nfel (h), is calculated for a solid with a flat surface of\n(0)\nheight h. Hence in order to calculate dfel /dh, we\n(0)\ndetermine fel for flat solids of heights h + \u03b4/2 and\n(0)\n(0)\nh \u2212 \u03b4/2, and use the estimate dfel /dh = [fel (h + \u03b4/2) \u2212\n(0)\nfel (h \u2212 \u03b4/2)]/\u03b4. Ideally, first principles, substance specific calculations should be performed in order to evaluate\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03c3xx (h, h) and fel (h), and we intend to carry out such\ncalculations. However, the qualitative general behaviour\n(0)\nof fel (h) can be obtained from much simpler models. To\ndemonstrate this point we carried out the calculation for\ntwo-dimensional networks of balls and springs of varying\nlattice-type and spring constants. In these calculations \u03b4\n(0)\nis one monolayer, and fel (h) is calculated at film thicknesses of integer numbers of monolayers from no film up\n(0)\nto 10 monolayers of film. Values of fel (h) for film heights\nof fractional monolayers are interprolated from the values\ncalculated at integer monolayer heights.\nIn the ball-and-spring model the balls are connected\nby springs that obey Hooke's law. Note that this does\n\none\nmonolayer\n\ny\n\nk2\n\nk1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 2. Example of a fcc-like lattice. The circles represent\nballs. The curvy lines are springs of spring constant k1 , and\nthe dashed lines represent springs of spring constant k2 .\n\nSimulations showed that whilst individual atoms were\nfree to move in the x-direction, they actually moved only\nin the y-direction. The relaxation in the y-direction depended on the film thickness and on the depth of the\natom in the lattice but was independent of x. In general\nballs at depth of more than 3 monolayers into the substrate experienced no stress.

Variation with film thickness of the elastic free en(0)\nergy of a relaxed ball-and-spring system, dfel /dh, as a function of film thickness h. The free energy is normalized to the\ninfinite film linear elastic energy density, 12 M \u03b52 . hml is the\nthickness of one monolayer.\n\nNote that the springs in a simple square lattice could\nrelax completely in the y-direction. Therefore, for such\na lattice the relaxation is independent of spring depth\n(0)\nwithin the film or film thickness, and fel (h) varies linearly with film thickness. Hence for a square lattice\n(0)\nd2 fel (h)/dh2 = 0. Only when diagonal bonds, such as\nthose in a fcc lattice were present did the springs show\ndepth dependent relaxation such as that described above.\nThe inability of the springs to completely relax due to the\npresence of diagonal bonds was a necessary condition for\n(0)\nfel (h) to vary nonlinearly with film height. In such in(0)\ncompletely relaxed films the nonlinear dependence of fel\non h arises from the elastic relaxation at the surface and\nits coupling to the relaxation at the film-substrate interface. A similar effect should occur in real systems due to\nsurface reconstruction, for example.\n(0)\nA typical behavior of dfel /dh is shown in Fig. 4, where\n(0)\nit is seen that fel (h) indeed depends on the thickness h.\n(0)\nMoreover, the model predicts that d2 fel /dh2 > 0 and\ndecreases with increasing film thickness, and therefore\naccording to the inequality (18) and the discussion following it, there should be a linearly stable wetting layer,\nwhose thickness is finite and increases with decreasing\nlattice mismatch.\n(0)\nWhilst the detailed dependence of dfel (h)/dh on\nfilm thickness close to the substrate-film interface [\u2264\n3 monolayers] varied between different networks, it\nshowed the same general behaviour. In all systems\n(0)\nd2 fel (h)/dh2 showed exponential decay with a decay\n\n(0)\n\nWe can explain the increase of dfel /dh with film thick(0)\nness intuitively. dfel /dh is the change in the free energy\nof a film as a monolayer is added. When a monolayer\nis added to a thick film the contribution to the free energy from the surface atoms and the interface remains\nthe same and the energy added is effectively that of a\nmonolayer in the 'bulk' of the film. Atoms in the bulk\nof a thick film are more constrained than those in a thin\nfilm where the atoms are relatively free to move and relax. When a monolayer is added to a thin film the energy\nchange is in between that of the constrained thick film\nbulk atoms and the relaxed surface atoms. Hence more\nfree energy is needed to add a monolayer to a thick film\n(0)\nand dfel /dh increases with film thickness.\nFor the calculations used later in this paper we used\nthe function\n(0)\n\ndfel (h)/dh =\n\nM \u03b52\n[1 \u2212 0.05 exp(\u2212h/hml )]\n2\n\nfor\n\nh > 0,\n(19)\n\n(0)\n\nand dfel (h)/dh = 0 for h \u2264 0. hml is the thickness of one monolayer. The exponential decay form of\n(0)\ndfel (h)/dh fits the results given by Tersoff [13]. In previous works [11,12,27] on the physics of the wetting layer\nit was assumed that the reference state energy variation\nis a smooth function of h, mainly in order to avoid nonanalyticities at the interface. In contrast, our reference\n8\n\n\fsolved the evolution equation by directly calculating the\nchemical potential from Eq. (12) at points along the film\nsurface we experienced numerical instabilities.\nWe have come up with the following solution to this\nproblem. The Nernst-Einstein equation can be derived\nby considering material of atomic volume moving along\nthe solid surface. When material jumps between neighboring atomic sites, it must cross a free energy barrier\nof \u2206F\u00b1 = Ed + (F\u00b1 \u2212 F0 )/2, where Ed is the potential\nbarrier for diffusion, F\u00b1 is the free energy of the film after material has been moved, and F0 is the free energy\nof the film before material is moved. The positive and\nnegative signs stand for forward and backward jumps,\nrespectively. This leads to the following equation for material velocity along the surface\n\nstate energy variation behaves as a step function of the\nsurface height with a small but important correction.\nThe deviations in the mismatch stress (averaged over\n(0)\nthe surface monolayer) at the film surface \u03c3xx (h, h) from\n(0)\na step function, \u03c3xx (h, h) = M \u03b5 when h > 0, was shown\nto be small (< 5%) but dependent on spring constants\n(0)\nand lattice type (See Fig. (5)). As variations in \u03c3xx (h, h)\nonly slightly alter the wetting layer thickness predicted\nfrom Eq.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF THIN FILM\nGROWTH\n\nA. The stability of thin films\n\nAs explained at the end of Section III, for systems with\nsmall mismatch and/or small vicinality (miscut angle)\none has to go beyond linear stability in order to understand their evolution. To this end we carried out numerical simulations of the evolution of the strained film.\nThe evolution equation (2) given by Mullins [19], which\nis derived from the Nernst-Einstein relation (1), includes\nderivatives of the chemical potential, \u03bc, along the surface.\nThis chemical potential is defined as the change in free\nenergy when an atom is added to the surface. Continuum\ntheory assumes that the free energy change when the surface is changed by an infinitesimal amount is proportional\nto this chemical potential (\u03bc = \u03a9 \u03b4F\n\u03b4h ). However, when we\n\nAccording to Eq. (20), anisotropic surface tension\ngreatly enlarges the linearly stable wetting layer thickness. Does this conclusion survive beyond linear stability analysis? When a linearly stable flat film is perturbed\nstrongly so that the surface orientation in some regions\nis far from the \u03b8 = 0 direction, the local surface stiffness\nin these regions is much smaller than the \u03b8 = 0 stiffness. This tends to destabilize the linearly stable film.\nIndeed, we carried out numerical simulations (using the\nprocedure described above) that showed that films thinner than the linear wetting layer were unstable to perturbations greater than a certain critical amplitude (see\n\n9\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 6). Hence films thinner than the linear wetting layer\nthickness are metastable. When large perturbations were\napplied, faceted islands developed in the film, which underwent ripening at later stages of the evolution.\n\n8\n\n7\n6\n\n6\n5\n\nml\n\nh/h\n\nh\n\n4\n\n4\n\nc\n\n/ h\n\nml\n\n3\n2\n\n\u03b4\n\n2\n\nc\n\nm\n\n/ h\n\nml\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n-1\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\nx/h\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nml\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nWhen the lattice mismatch is small, \u03b4cm is much larger\nthan the linear wetting layer thickness (see Fig. 7).\nHence, flat films thinner than the linear critical thickness are stable at small lattice mismatch. As the linear\ncritical thickness at small lattice mismatch is very large,\nwe expect the film to first become unstable to misfit dislocations. This in indeed seen in experiments [8,9].\nAt intermediate lattice mismatch, \u03b4cm is of the order of\na few monolayers. Hence we expect such a film to become\nunstable as perturbations of this amplitude are physically\nlikely. In this regime films should develop growing perturbations at wavelengths given by \u03bb/lo \u223c 10 \u2212 50. This\ncorresponds to wavelengths of a few hundred nanometers.\nThis typical wavelength decreases as lattice mismatch increases, agreeing with experiment [6,8]. As \u03b5 increases,\n\u03b4cm decreases in this regime from about 10 monolayers\nto approximately one monolayer, we expect the thickness of the film needed to support such perturbations to\ncorrespondingly decrease. Such a trend is seen in experiments [6\u20139]. In order to compare quantitative wetting\nlayer thickness and its lattice mismatch dependence with\nexperiments we will have to carry out first principles,\n(0)\nsubstance-specific calculations to evaluate fel (h). However, the general qualitative trends predicted here agree\nwith experimental observations.\nLooking at Fig. 7 we see that at intermediate lattice\nmismatch the critical perturbation amplitude, \u03b4cm , and\nthe linear wetting layer thickness are of the same order\nof magnitude (several monolayers). This could mean that\n\nWe carried out simulations for films perturbed by random perturbations and by perturbations of a single wavelength. The critical perturbation amplitude, \u03b4c , depends\non the wavelength of the perturbation, \u03bb, taking its minimal value\n\u03bb\n\n0.04\n\nFIG. 7.

The linear wetting\nlayer thickness, hc /hml , is represented by the dashed line.\nThe dotted line shows the size of one monolayer, hml , for\ncomparison.\n\nFIG. 6. Evolution of a randomly perturbed film, in which\nperturbations were larger than the critical perturbation amplitude. Lattice mismatch in this film is 4%. The initial film\nsurface is shown as a thin solid line. The dashed line shows the\nfilm surface at a later time. The linear wetting layer thickness\nis shown as a thick solid line.\n\n\u03b4cm = min \u03b4c (\u03bb)\n\n0.02\n\n(22)\n\nat \u03bb/lo \u223c 10\u221250, where lo = 2\u03b3o /M \u03b52 . \u03b4cm in monolayers\nis plotted as a function of lattice mismatch in Fig. 7. The\nlinear wetting layer thickness for G = 500, M = 1.5 \u00d7\n1011 N/m2 and hml = 5\u00c5 is also shown for comparison.\n\u03b4cm was found to be proportional to \u03b5\u22122 . The \u03b5\u22122 dependence is expected for an infinite film as in this case the\nevolution equations (Eq. (2) together with Eq. (12)) can\nbe made spatially dimensionless by scaling all lengths by\nl0 . Hence all perturbations of size \u03b4/l0 and with the same\ndimensionless wavenumber kl0 will evolve identically.\n\u03b4cm was largely independent of cusp smoothness G, unlike the linear wetting layer thickness which depended\nstrongly on G. This suggests that unlike the linear wetting layer thickness the critical perturbation amplitude\ncan be used in predicting the outcome of experimental\nthin film growth. The mean square amplitude of the\nrandom perturbation needed to destabilize thin films was\nalso shown to be largely independent of G and was proportional to \u03b5\u22122 .\n\n10\n\n\fwe have to also consider the linear wetting layer thickness\nwith its strong dependence on the surface miscut angle\nwhen deciding whether or not a thin film will be unstable. However, the infinitesimal perturbations needed\nto perturb the linear wetting layer occur at wavelength,\n2\u03c0\ne0 , whereas the typical wavelength at which crit\u03bb = M\u03b5\n2\u03b3\nical amplitude perturbations first appear in the film is,\n2\n\u03bb \u223c 10 M\u03b5\n2 \u03b30 . Using expression (14), the ratio between\nthese two wavelengths is approximately equal to G. For\nphysical values of G the linear wetting layer perturbations will have wavelengths of the order of 100\u03bcm which\nis larger than the typical sample size, whereas the wavelength which corresponds to the minimal critical perturbation is much smaller (\u223c 100nm). Therefore physical\nthin films should first become unstable when the film\nthickness is large enough to support perturbations larger\nthan the critical perturbation amplitude.\nFor very large mismatch, a perturbation smaller than a\nmonolayer is sufficient in order to destabilize the linearly\nstable wetting layer. Therefore, in practice, the wetting\nlayer is a single monolayer in this case.\n\nwhere we have assumed the reference state mismatch\n(0)\nstress is given by a step function, \u03c3xx (h, h) = M \u03b5 when\n(0)\nh > 0, and \u03c3xx (h, h) = 0 when h < 0. Using the general form (obtained from the ball-and-spring model) of\n(0)\nM\u03b52\nexp(\u2212h/hml ), where \u03c7 is a constant,\nd2 fel /dh2 \u2243 \u03c7 2h\nml\ngives the following solution for perturbation growth:\n\b \u0002\n\u03b4(t) = \u03b40 exp K (\u2212k 4 \u03b3\ne0 + 2k 3 M \u03b52 )t+\n\u0003\nk 2 \u03c7(M \u03b52 /2VD )exp(\u2212C/hml )(exp(\u2212VD t/hml ) \u2212 1) . (26)\nNote that in linear stability analysis a perturbation in\nan infinite film decays when k > 2M \u03b52 /e\n\u03b30 and grows\nexponentially when k < 2M \u03b52 /e\n\u03b30 .\nFor isotropic surface tension, numerical computations\nshowed that when k \u2217 < k < 2M \u03b52 /e\n\u03b30 , with k \u2217 \u2248\n2\n0.875 \u00d7 2M \u03b5 /e\n\u03b30 , both methods of deposition lead to\ncusp formation in the surface valleys. The cusps initially\nevolve according to the linear evolution equation (26) and\nthen slow and reach a steady state morphology. Spencer\nand Meiron [29] observed such steady states in infinitely\nthick stressed films. However when k < k \u2217 , surface evolution depends on the method of material deposition.\nWhen deposition is constant in the vertical y-direction\nincreasingly sharp cusps form in the surface valleys (see\nFig. 8a), which continue to grow exponentially. In contrast when deposition is constant perpendicular to the\nsurface at very high deposition rates cusp formation is\nslowed (see Fig. 8b) and the surface shows signs of reaching a steady-state morphology as for k > k \u2217 .\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\nml\nD\n\nml\n\n8\n\n6\n\n(23)\n\nwhere VD is the material deposition rate.\nThe second type is deposition constant in the direction\nperpendicular to the film surface, corresponding to liquid phase epitaxy, for example.

Under deposition perpendicular\n\n(25)\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 10 shows the sharp cusp growing only slightly faster\nthan predicted by linear analysis. This slight deviation\nis expected as the stress in a cusp valley is larger than in\na sine valley hence accelerating perturbation growth.\nWhen the surface tension is anisotropic the surface evolution is very different from that predicted by the linear\nanalysis. As can be seen in Fig. 10, a perturbation in\nan isotropic film decays until the film surface reaches a\nheight at which the film is linearly unstable to perturbations at that wavelength . No matter how large the\ndeposition rate, at any given time a perturbation in a\nthin film is always smaller than a perturbation of the\nsame initial size in an infinite film due to the finite time\nspent in the linear wetting layer.\n\nto the film surface, when a cusp begins to form, material is deposited more rapidly on the steep cusp slope,\nhence slowing cusp formation. When deposition is constant vertically it only effects surface evolution indirectly\nby raising the average surface height. Though deposition rates of this magnitude are not generally used in\nexperiment it is nevertheless physically interesting to observe the difference in surface evolution between the two\ngrowth methods.\n10\n\nThick film:\nThin film:\nV =0\nD\n\nV =12nm/s\nD\n\nV =1.2nm/s\nD\n\nV =120nm/s\nD\n\nV =4nm/s\nD\n\nV =1200nm/s\nD\n\n\u03b4/\u03b40\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u03b4/\u03b40\n\n1\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nTime(s)\n0.1\n\nFIG. 9.

The\nrate and amplitude of the decrease is independent of either C or VD . The film then grows or decays depending\non whether the perturbation amplitude \u03b4(t), is larger or\nsmaller than the critical perturbation amplitude \u03b4c (k, h),\nat h = VD t + C.

There are\nfive independent variables that can effect the evolution:\nVD , C, k, t and \u03b5. In addition, there are four relevant constant parameters: hml , K, e\n\u03b30 and M . We can replace the\nfive independent variables by the dimensionless variables:\nVD t/hml , C/hml , Ke\n\u03b30 k 4 t, KM \u03b52 k 3 t, KM \u03b52 k 2 t/hml .\nThe idea is that the description of the evolution of a film\nwith isotropic surface tension becomes simpler in terms\nof these variables. This becomes clear when we look at\nhow a perturbation in a thin film grows in relation to\nthe growth of a perturbation of the same initial size in\nan infinite film. Quantitatively, this is described by the\nrelative perturbation height, \u03b4R = \u03b4(t, C)/\u03b4(t, C = \u221e).\nAs can be seen from Eq. (26), \u03b4R depends only on three\nof the five independent dimensionless variables:\n\n\u03b4R (k, VD , \u03b5 , t, C) = \u03b4R (VD t/hml , C/hml ,\np+q/2+1\n\nKe\n\u03b30\n\n\u03b5\nexp(\u2212C/hml )(exp(\u2212VD t/hml )\u22121)\nKk2 \u03c7 M\n2V\nD\n\n,\n\n)\n\n(29)\n\nwith p \u223c 2.37 and q \u223c \u22126.5. Again, \u03b4R depends only\non three of the five scaling variables, which implies data\ncollapse. This relation was very robust. We verified it\nfor different G, variation of k of an order of magnitude,\nvariation of \u03b5 by 100% and deposition rates of between 0\nand 120000\u00c5/s. Figures 11 and 12 show this scaling in\nthe form of data collapse when C = 2M L. Data collapse\nwhen \u03b4R is plotted against a variable proportional to the\nthird scaling variable in Eq. (29) can be seen in Fig. 11.\nHere there is no deposition, k varies by over an order\nof magnitude and \u03b5 by 100%. As can be seen the data\ncollapse is not exact but holds to a good approximation.\nFigure 12 shows data collapse when \u03b4R is plotted against\nvariables proportional to the first and third scaling variables in Eq. (29). Deposition rates vary by six orders of\nmagnitude, k varies by over an order of magnitude and\n\u03b5 by 100%. Data collapse is shown by all curves falling\nonto a single surface.\n\n2\n\n\u03b4R = e\n\nq/2+4\n\nM \u2212p\u2212q/2 \u03b5\u22122p\u2212q k p t/hml\n\n(27)\n1.0\n\nThis can be summarized in the scaling law:\n\u03b4R (VD , C, k, t, \u03b5) = \u03b4R (VD t/hml , C/hml , KM \u03b52 k 2 t/hml ),\n(28)\n\n0.9\n\nwhich implies that \u03b4R depends only on three of the five\nscaling variables. The manifestation of this scaling behaviour is data collapse. For example, when VD = 0 and\nC is fixed, all the curves of \u03b4R (t) for different values of k\nand \u03b5 fall onto a single curve if plotted as a function of\nk 2 \u03b52 t rather than t.\nDoes this scaling law survive beyond linear analysis?\nWe looked for scaling when deposition was constant in\nthe vertical y-direction for both isotropic and anisotropic\nsurface tension. As mentioned earlier when surface tension is isotropic the film continued to evolve according\nto the linear evolution equation (26) long after it left\nthe linear regime and hence the scaling relation (28) also\nheld.\nGrowth under anisotropic surface tension is very different from that given by the linear evolution equation (26), and hence the scaling relation (28) does\nnot hold.\nDoes this mean that the physics of\nanisotropic surfaces is more complicated and depends\non all five independent variables? It turns out the\nanswer to this question is no to a good approximation. To see this we define five generalized dimensionless variables: VD t/hml , C/hml , Ke\n\u03b30 k 4 t, KM \u03b52 k 3 t, and\np+q/2+1\nq/2+4\nKe\n\u03b30\nM \u2212p\u2212q/2 \u03b5\u22122p\u2212q k p t/hml . When p = 2 and\nq = \u22126 we regain the dimensionless variables governing the linear evolution equation. We found numerically\nthat in the case of anisotropic surface tension, \u03b4R approximately obeys the scaling law: :\n\n\u03b4\n\nR\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n\u03b5=4%\n\nk=8\n\n\u03b5=4%\n\nk=2.4\n\n\u03b5=4%\n\nk=4\n\nx10\n\n\u03b5=4%\n\nk=8\n\nx10\n\n\u03b5=6%\n\nk=1.8\n\nx10\n\n\u03b5=6%\n\nk=1.8\n\nx10\n\n\u03b5=7.5% k=2.8\n\nx10\n\n0.00\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\n-5\n\nx10\n\nM/\n-4\n\nx10\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\n-4\n\nM/\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\n-4\n\nM/\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\nM/\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\nM/\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\nM/\n\nq\n0.04\n\nM\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\n\nM/\n\n0\n\n0.01\np\n\nk\n\n0.02\n\n\u03b5\n\n-q-2p\n\nt\n\nFIG. 11.

This is probably because when \u03b40 > \u03b4c (k, C) perturbations of a thin film\nand of an infinite film evolve similarly. Both perturbations initially decay whilst faceting and then continue to\n\n13\n\n\fgrow. On the other hand, when \u03b4c (k, \u221e) < \u03b40 < \u03b4c (k, C)\na perturbation of a thin film decays whereas an infinite\nfilm perturbation facets and grows. In this regime scaling\nlaws were not found. When \u03b40 < \u03b4c (k, \u221e) the perturbation decays in both the thin and infinite film. When \u03b40\nis small enough the scaling laws (28) derived from the\nlinear evolution equation are regained.\n\n[6] Floro J.A, Chason E, Twesten R.D, R.Q. Hwang, L.B.\nFreud, Phys. Rev.
