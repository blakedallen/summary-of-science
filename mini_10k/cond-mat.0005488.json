This mechanism has no analogue in the\nbulk band structure.

In a 2D hole\nsystem (2DHS) we have heavy hole (HH) subbands (z\ncomponent of angular momentum M = \u00b13/2) and light\nhole (LH) subbands (M = \u00b11/2). In the presence of\nan in-plane B, \u03ba couples the two LH states, and the HH\nstates to the LH states [4]. But there is no direct coupling\nbetween the HH states proportional to \u03ba. Therefore, the\nauthors of Refs. [3\u20136] concluded that the Zeeman splitting of HH states due to an in-plane B is suppressed.\nHowever, this result is correct only for quantum wells\n(QW's) grown in the crystallographic high-symmetry directions [001] and [111] as for the other growth directions\nwe show that a new mechanism gives rise to a large and\nhighly anisotropic Zeeman splitting with respect to different orientations of the in-plane magnetic field B relative\nto the crystal axes. In the following we will discuss QW's\ngrown in the crystallographic [mmn] direction (with m, n\nintegers). For this purpose we use the coordinate system\nshown in Fig. 1 with \u03b8 denoting the angle between [mmn]\nand [001]. We remark that recently QW's for 2DHS's\nhave often been grown in [113] direction as this yields\nparticularly high hole mobilities [9,10].\nWe describe the hole subband states by means of\nthe 4 \u00d7 4 Luttinger Hamiltonian [8]. For the in-plane\nB = (Bx , By , 0) we use the vector potential A =\n(zBy , \u2212zBx , 0). Treating A and B by means of degenerate perturbation theory we obtain in second order for g \u2217\nat the bottom of the HH subbands in an infinitely deep\nrectangular QW\n\nSince the early days of two-dimensional (2D) carrier\nsystems in semiconductors it has been commonly assumed that the Zeeman energy splitting, \u2206E = g \u2217 \u03bcB B,\nwith g \u2217 the effective g-factor and \u03bcB the Bohr magneton,\nis independent of the direction of the external magnetic\nfield B [1]. Recently, however, calculations and experiments have shown that g \u2217 can have different values for\nB applied in the direction normal to the plane of the\n2D system compared to in-plane [2\u20136]. Here we report\ncalculations and experimental data for 2D holes occupying the heavy hole subband, demonstrating that, even\nfor a purely in-plane B, g \u2217 can depend strongly on the\norientation of B with respect to the crystal axes. We\nshow that the mechanism giving rise to this remarkable gfactor anisotropy is fundamentally different from the one\nresponsible for the in-plane/out of plane anisotropy of g \u2217\ndiscussed in previous work [2\u20136]: the latter is basically\na consequence of the bulk Zeeman Hamiltonian whereas\nthe in-plane anisotropy we are reporting stems from the\ncombined effect of the bulk g \u2217 and the anisotropic orbital\nmotion of 2D hole states in semiconductor quantum wells.\nIn bulk semiconductors the motion of electrons and\nholes in the presence of spin-orbit interaction gives rise\nto a g \u2217 which is significantly modified compared to the\nfree particle g-factor g0 = 2 (Ref. [7]). The resulting\ng \u2217 of holes (and electrons) is nearly isotropic. Commonly, the isotropic part of the hole g \u2217 is denoted by\n\u03ba [8]. The anisotropic part, q, is typically two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than \u03ba and, in the present discussion,\nis neglected completely. The smallness of q is in sharp\ncontrast to the orbital motion of holes for which we have\n\nq\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03ba (\u03b33 \u2212 \u03b32 )\nHH\n= 6 2 \u2212 3 sin2 (\u03b8) sin(\u03b8) 4 \u2212 3 sin2 (\u03b8) HH\ng[nn(2m)]\n\u03b3z \u2212 \u03b3zLH\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03ba (\u03b33 \u2212 \u03b32 )\nHH\n= \u22126 2 \u2212 3 sin2 (\u03b8) sin2 (\u03b8) HH\ng[110]\n\u03b3z \u2212 \u03b3zLH\n\n1\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\n\fwith\n\u03b3zHH\n\u03b3zLH\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n= \u2212\u03b31 + 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b32 + \u03b1\u03b33\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u2212\u03b31 \u2212 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b32 + \u03b1\u03b33\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b1 = sin2 (\u03b8) 3 \u2212 49 sin2 (\u03b8) .\n\nwhen B k [332] compared to when B k [110]. Moreover,\nHH\n.\nis opposite to the sign of g[110]\nthe sign of g HH\n\n(2a)\n\n[nn(2m)]\n\nEquation (1) is applicable to a wide range of cubic\nsemiconductors with results qualitatively very similar to\nFig. 2. In particular, the relative anisotropy\n\n(2b)\n(2c)\n\nHere \u03b31 , \u03b32 , and \u03b33 , are the Luttinger parameters [8]\nand \u03b3zHH and \u03b3zLH are the reciprocal effective masses in\nz-direction in the axial approximation for the HH and\nLH subbands, respectively [11]. In Eq. (1) the factor\n(\u03b33 \u2212 \u03b32 ) characterizes the anisotropy of the bulk valence\nband [12]. Hence, the anisotropic g-factor (1) is due to\nthe combined effect of the isotropic bulk g-factor \u03ba and\nthe anisotropy of the valence band. It disappears in the\naxial limit (\u03b33 \u2212 \u03b32 ) = 0. The Zeeman splitting discussed\nhere has no analogue in the bulk band structure. It is a\nunique feature of 2D systems. Therefore, Eq. (1) is fundamentally different from the anisotropy of g \u2217 discussed\nin Refs. [2\u20136] as the latter originates in properties of the\nbulk Zeeman Hamiltonian. Our sign convention for g \u2217\nused in Eq. (1) corresponds to the dominant spinor component of the multicomponent eigenstates (using a basis\nof angular momentum eigenfunctions with quantization\naxis in the direction of B). Note that in unstrained QW's\nthe topmost subband is the HH1 subband.\nFor LH subbands in an in-plane B as well as for HH\nand LH subbands in a perpendicular B, g \u2217 contains terms\nsimilar to Eq. (1). However, the dominant contribution is\ngiven by the bulk g-factor \u03ba. For LH subbands in an inplane B we have basically gkLH = 4\u03ba, while for a perpendicular B we have gzHH = 6\u03ba and gzLH = 2\u03ba (Refs. [6,8]).\nYet, this implies a remarkable difference [3\u20136] compared\nwith Eq. (1).\nIn Fig. 2 we show the anisotropic g \u2217 of the HH1 subband for a 200 \u00c5 wide GaAs/Al0.3 Ga0.7 As QW as a function of the angle \u03b8. The analytical expressions (1) (dotted and dashed-dotted lines) are in very good agreement\nwith the more accurate results obtained by means of a\nnumerical diagonalization [4,13] of the Luttinger Hamiltonian (solid and dashed lines). Figure 2 demonstrates\nthat g \u2217 can be very anisotropic [14]. For example, for\nthe growth direction [113], g \u2217 is about a factor of 4 larger\n\n3\n\n\u2206E = (\u03bcB B)\n\n\u0012\n\nm0 d2\n\u03c0 2 h\u03042\n\nHH\ng[110]\n\ng HH\n\n[nn(2m)]\n\nsin(\u03b8)\n= \u2212q\n4 \u2212 3 sin2 (\u03b8)\n\n(3)\n\nis independent of the material-specific parameters \u03b3i and\n\u03ba. This remarkable result can be traced back to the fact\nthat the anisotropy for different directions \u03b8 in k-space\nis always characterized by the single parameter (\u03b33 \u2212 \u03b32 )\n(Ref. [12]). Note that for QW's based on narrow-gap\nsemiconductors we have a larger \u03ba and smaller effective\nmasses so that for these materials the absolute values\nof g \u2217 are significantly larger than g \u2217 of GaAs shown in\nFig. 2, but the g \u2217 anisotropy is still given by Eq. (3) and\ndepends only on \u03b8. The Zeeman splitting can be even further enhanced if one uses semimagnetic semiconductors\ncontaining, e.g., Mn. For these materials the structure\nof the Hamiltonian is identical to the conventional Luttinger Hamiltonian in the presence of a magnetic field\nwith \u03ba replaced by the effective g-factor due to the paramagnetic exchange interaction [5,6]. Therefore Eq. (1)\nand the g \u2217 anisotropy [Eq. (3)] are readily applicable to\nsemimagnetic materials, also.\nIn a Taylor expansion of the Zeeman splitting, \u2206E(B),\ng \u2217 (times \u03bcB ) is the prefactor for the lowest order term\nlinear in B. Often terms of higher order in B are neglected because of their relevant insignificance. An interesting feature of Fig. 2 is the vanishing of g \u2217 for the\nhigh-symmetry growth directions [001] and [111] (Ref.\n[4]). For the 2DHS discussed in Fig. 2 this results in a\nsplitting \u2206E which at B = 1 T is more than 2 orders of\nmagnitude smaller than \u2206E for growth directions [113]\nand [110]. For these high-symmetry directions \u2206E is proportional to B 3 (Ref. [15]). In second order perturbation\ntheory we obtain for the HH1 subband of an infinitely\ndeep rectangular QW of width d grown in [001] direction\n\n\u0014\n\u00132 q\n\u0015\n4\u03ba (\u03c0 2 \u2212 6)\n27\u03b33\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b32 cos (2\u03c6) + \u03b33 sin (2\u03c6) HH\n.\n+ HH\n\u03b3z \u2212 \u03b3zLH\n\u03b3z \u2212 9\u03b3zLH\n\nHere \u03c6 is the angle between the in-plane B and the [100]\naxis. The first term in the square bracket stems from k*p\ncoupling between the subbands HH1 and LH1, and the\nsecond term is due to coupling between HH1 and LH3.\nWe get similar, though somewhat longer expressions for\ngrowth direction [111]. It is remarkable that we have a\nnonzero \u2206E even in the limit \u03ba = 0. This can be understood as follows: The 4 \u00d7 4 Luttinger Hamiltonian [8]\nwhich is underlying our calculations corresponds to an\n\n(4)\n\ninfinitely large spin-orbit splitting between the topmost\nvalence band \u0393v8 and the split-off band \u0393v7 . Therefore\nspin-orbit interaction is not explicitely visible in our results, though, similar to Zeeman splitting in bulk semiconductors [7], Eqs. (1) and (4) are a consequence of\nspin-orbit interaction. In 2D systems the motion of electrons and holes in the presence of this interaction can\ngive rise to a Zeeman splitting even without a bulk g \u2217 .\nWe remark that in a parabolic QW the in-plane g \u2217 of the\n2\n\n\fHH subbands also contains such terms independent of \u03ba.\nWe have here a 2D analogue of Roth's famous formula [7]\nfor the electron bulk g \u2217 . Finally we note that, unlike [11]\nEq. (1), \u2206E in Eq. (4) increases proportional to d4 , i.e.,\nZeeman splitting is most efficiently suppressed in narrow\nQW's.\nNow we will show that the anisotropy of g \u2217 can be\nprobed experimentally by measuring the magnetoresistance of a high-mobility 2DHS as a function of in-plane\nB. The samples are 200 \u00c5 wide Si-modulation doped\nGaAs QW's grown on (113)A GaAs substrates. These\nsamples exhibit a mobility anisotropy believed to be due\nto an anisotropic surface morphology [16]. They are patterned with an L-shaped Hall bar to allow simultaneous\nmeasurements of the resistivity along the [332] and [110]\ndirections. Front and back gates are used to control the\n2D density in the QW and the perpendicular electric field\nwhich characterizes the asymmetry of the sample [10].\nThe left two panels of Fig. 3 show the resistivity \u03c1\nmeasured as a function of in-plane B for three different densities and different relative orientations of B and\ncurrent I. For easier comparison we have plotted the\nfractional change \u03c1(B)/\u03c1(B = 0). Apart from an overall positive magnetoresistance these curves show a broad\nfeature consisting of an inflection point followed by a reduction in slope followed by another inflection point. In\nFig. 3 we have placed arrows between the two inflection\npoints at a value of B we call B \u2217 . Similar, though sharper\nfeatures have been observed in systems with several occupied confinement subbands when a subband is depopulated by means of an in-plane B [17]. We propose that\nthe magnetoresistance feature at B \u2217 in Fig. 3 is related to\na spin-subband depopulation and the resulting changes in\nsubband mobility and intersubband scattering as the inplane B is increased. Note that in each panel of Fig. 3, B \u2217\nis the same for both current directions even though the\nmagnetoresistance is very different. This implies that B \u2217\ndepends on parameters which do not depend on current\ndirection. This supports our hypothesis, as spin-subband\ndepopulation should not depend on the direction of current in the sample.\nOur interpretation of B \u2217 is obviously consistent with\n\u2217\nB in Fig. 3 becoming larger with increasing density. It\nis remarkable that B \u2217 for the B k [332] traces is about\n4 T smaller than for the [110] traces, regardless of the\nI direction. We associate this with the anisotropy of\nthe in-plane g \u2217 . This interpretation is validated by our\nself-consistently calculated [4,11,13] results for the density N+ of the upper spin subband as a function of B,\nshown in the right panel of Fig. 3. The density N+ decreases much faster for B k [332] than for B k [110], in\nagreement with Fig. 2. We have further support for our\ninterpretation of B \u2217 from experiments where we increase\nthe asymmetry of the confining potential by means of\nthe front and back gates while keeping the 2D density\nfixed. We observe an increase in B \u2217 , in agreement with\nthe results of our self-consistent calculations.\n\nOne might ask whether the data in Fig. 3 actually\ncould be summarized by a single value of g \u2217 for each\ntrace. Unfortunately, this is not possible because, due to\nthe complicated band structure of holes, g \u2217 depends on\nenergy E, and we are averaging over g \u2217 (E) for E between\nthe subband edge and the Fermi energy. The importance\nof this effect can be readily deduced from the right panel\nof Fig. 3, as we would have straight lines for N+ (B) if g \u2217\n(and the effective mass m\u2217 ) were not dependent on E.\nIn Fig. 3 the measured B \u2217 is significantly smaller than\nthe calculated B for a complete depopulation of the upper\nspin-subband. We note that for our low-density samples\nit can be expected that g \u2217 is enhanced due to the exchange interaction [1,18]. This effect was not taken into\naccount in our self-consistent calculations. The qualitative agreement between the experimental data and the\ncalculations, however, implies that these many-particle\neffects do not affect the anisotropy of g \u2217 .\nThe large anisotropy of the Zeeman splitting in 2DHS's\noffers many possible device applications. In a polycrystalline material, e.g., one could alter the degree of spin\npolarization in different domains by changing the direction of the external B. As can be seen in Fig. 2, because\nof the sign reversal of g \u2217 it is even possible to have different domains with opposite spin polarization for a given\ndirection of B. Recently, there has been a growing interest in controlling the spin degree of freedom for quantum computing and spin electronics. In Ref. [19] the authors have sketched a quantum device which makes use\nof the spatial variation of g \u2217 in layered semiconductor\nstructures made of, e.g., Alx Iny Ga1\u2212x\u2212y As. However,\nthe authors have estimated that a substantial change in\ng \u2217 requires a fairly large electric field of the order of\n100 kV/cm. Oestreich et al. [20] and Fiederling et al.\n[21] have suggested a spin aligner based on semimagnetic\nsemiconductors. Here the g-factor anisotropy of 2DHS's\nprovides a powerful additional degree of freedom for engineering such devices.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that coupling the spin\ndegree of freedom to the anisotropic orbital motion of\n2D hole systems gives rise to a highly anisotropic Zeeman splitting with respect to different orientations of an\nin-plane magnetic field relative to the crystal axes.\nR.
