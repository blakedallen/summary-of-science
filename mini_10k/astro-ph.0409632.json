He noted: \"each of these four galaxies show asymmetric features in their\nHI distribution, especially UGC 622. ... The presence of HI asymmetries and the small\ndispersion in radial velocities makes it likely that all detected four galaxies are members\nof one group\" at the distance of D = 38.5 Mpc (H0 = 75 km/s/Mpc is assumed). Because\nof its unfavourable location close to the Zone of avoidance (bII \u2243 \u2212150 ) this group was\n\n\fFigure 1: DSS2 (POSS II) blue image of the IC 65 group of galaxies: four certain group\nmembers with heliocentric redshits in brackets (red labels); four new probable LSB dwarf\nmembers (pink labels). The HI contours (white) have been obtained from van Moorsel\n(1983) and correspond to the 2.5 - 3 \u03c3 noise level (2.3 - 8.6 \u00d7 1020 atoms cm\u22122 ). Two\nearly type galaxies (with yellow PGC numbers) are probably located in the background\nof the group. The size of the image is 55\u2032 \u00d7 55\u2032. The north is at the top and the east is\nto the left.\n\n\fnot registered in earlier catalogs of nearby groups, and has been registered as the Lyon\nGroup of Galaxies (LGG) 16 (Garcia 1993). It fulfills selection criteria of the Hickson\ncompact groups. Van Moorsel (1983) detected one more HI-rich LSB anonymous (A)\ngalaxy located \u223c 5.0\u2032 to the NE of IC 65 (A 0101+4744 in the Fig. 1), having systemic\nvelocity, which is close to the group mean. This encourages us to look for further dwarf\ncompanions in the area of this particular group.\n\n3\n\nA search for new dwarf companion candidates\n\nWe carried out a systematic search for new LSB dwarf member candidates of this particular group by utilizing the digitized POSS II (DSS 2) blue and red frames, which\nwere previously linearized and photometrically calibrated by us. The searched area was\n60\u2032 \u00d7 60\u2032 , i.e. 0.67 \u00d7 0.67 Mpc at the distance of the group. The detection of objects\nwas performed by means of running the SExtractor software (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) in\ndouble-image mode on the blue and red DSS 2 frames. Galaxies were selected in the SExtracted catalog by several steps using the stellarity index, diameters and surface brightness\n(SB) characteristics. In a crowded environment of the IC 65 group the automatic selection\nwas insufficient. We needed to take the morphologies into account. In effect, the final list\nof 105 galaxies was selected, which is believed to be complete for objects with diameters\n\u2265 2\u2032\u2032 at the 25.5 B/\u2737\u2032\u2032 isophote.\n\nFigure 2: Classification of SExtracted objects in the field of the IC 65 group: left) Mean\nsurface brightness within 2\u2032\u2032 aperture < SB 2 > as a function of total B-magnitude. The\ndashed line is the median predicted position of dwarf galaxies , obtained from Ferguson\n& Binggeli (1994, Fig. 3), and scaled for the IC 65 group. right) Light concentration\nparameter B(16\u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 B(8\u2032\u2032 ) versus central B \u2212 R color index. Coding: filled hexagons luminous certain group members; double circles - large LSB galaxies \u2013 probable new dwarf\nmembers of the group; large circles - other LSB galaxies in the field; small circles - HSB\ngalaxies in the field; crosses - bright stars with B < 15 mag.\nIn order to disentangle the possible new dwarf members of the group from distant field\ngalaxies, we applied two criteria: 1) the Binggeli's (1994) empirical relation between the\n\n\fcentral SB and absolute magnitude, common both for dE and dIrr galaxies (Fig. 2a), and\n2) the empirical light concentration parameter, as proposed by Trentham et al. (2001),\nversus SExtracted colour index (Fig. 2b). As a result, we have selected four LSB irregular\ngalaxies, which show the lowest light concentration (i.e. the largest scale lengths), the\nbluest color (0.45 < B \u2212 R < 1.05), and fit the empirical Binggeli's relation for dwarf\ngalaxies. There are 7 more galaxies with LSB morphologies, but all of them with B > 19.0.\nAt fainter magnitudes and/or smaller diameters we actually lose the ability to distinguish\npossible group members from the background galaxies on SB grounds.\nTable 1 lists the basic data for certain group members and for new selected anonymous\n(A) probable dwarf members.

The exposure times were 100 600 sec with seeing conditions typically between 1.5\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2.5\u2032\u2032 (FWHM). For magnitude\ncalibration and color correction, standard stars were observed simultaneously in the star\ncluster NGC 7790 (Christian et al. 1986). Deep images (1800 sec in B and 1200 sec in\nR), which were taken in 1995 under nonphotometric conditions, were calibrated by means\nof comparing total fluxes of a sample of nonsaturated stellar images in the photometric\nand nonphotometric frames.\n\n5\n\nData reduction\n\nAfter standard correction procedures the CCD frames were smoothed by means of the\nadaptive filtering technique described in Lorenz et al. (1993) and run within the MIDAS\nenvironment. Next, the sky background was fitted by a tilted plane, using the leastsquares method. After background subtraction the galaxies were interactively cleaned\nfrom disturbing objects using the interactive polygon editor.\n\n\fThe surface brightness (SB) distribution was analyzed by two methods. First, we\ncalculated the equivalent light profile by slicing the smoothed galaxy image at predefined\nintensity levels and counting the pixel intensities in the areas between successive isophotes.\nThe differential counts reduced to a unit area give the azimuthally averaged intensity\nprofile of the galaxy as a function of the equivalent radius. This procedure permits to\nenhance signal-to-noise ratio for the faint outskirts of the galaxies and to proceed the\nSB profile until \u223c 26.5B/\u2737\u2032\u2032 . A set of isophotal, effective and asymptotic photometric\nparameters was determined on the basis of the equivalent light profiles and light growth\ncurves.\nThe second approach should receive some information about the two-dimensional\nstructure. For this purpose, we used the ellipse fitting algorithm of Bender & M\u00f6llenhoff\n(1986) as available in MIDAS. We obtained a set of radial profiles - surface brightness\n(SB), axis ratio (b/a), position angle (PA) and decentering (x \u2212 x0 and y \u2212 y0 ) - in each\nparticular passband. The color-index profile was calculated by means of combining these\nparticular SB profiles.\n\n6\n\nSB profile description\n\nThe SB profiles depend on the morphological type and bear some information about the\npossible environmental influences on the dynamical evolution of galaxies. Preliminary\ninspection of the derived SB profiles reveals that those of the LSB dwarf galaxies show\nminor deviations from the pure exponential mostly in their inner parts, because of the\noccurrence of star-forming knots, if any. The outer (generally rather noisy) profile might\nrepresent the older, underlying disk of the dwarf galaxy and therefore provides physically\nmeaningful parameters when fitted by an exponential density law.\nThe luminous group members show evidence of multiple components in their SB profiles.\nHowever, the conventional bulge/disk decomposition looks straightforward only for the\nparent galaxy IC 65 and the late type LSB galaxy UGC 608, both of which show evidence\nof a faint bulge and/or a bar component. Another bright member galaxy UGC 622 shows\na typical type II profile (Freeman 1970), and the \"edge-on\" galaxy is evidently a pure\nlate type disk galaxy. The obvious first step is to fit the SB profiles with the exponential\nintensity law \u03bc(r) = \u03bco + 1.086 r/h. The scaling parameters (\u03bco , h) have been obtained\nfrom the SB profiles using the \"marking the disk\" method. The disk fitting range was\ndefined for each galaxy individually in outer part of the profile. In the case of IC 65 and\nUGC 608, both of which show reliable excess light above the exponential disk model, this\nextra light was modeled with a Sersic (1968) power law \u03bc(r) \u221d (r/h)1/n , which has been\nfound proper when describing the light distribution of spiral bulges (e.g. Andredakis et\nal. 1995).\n\n7\n\nThe main results of surface photometry\n\nThe main photometric results are presented in the form of a) a set of 2D images (broadband optical and NIR image, color-index image, HI contour image (when available); b) 1D\nradial profiles (SB and color-index profiles, etc.); c) tables with conventional photometric\nand exponential model parameters. The 2D images show important morphological aspects\nsuch as the bulge contribution, the presence of bars and the shape of spiral arms. We\n\n\fapply contours of the Laplacian-filtered image in order to reveal specific morphological\nfeatures in luminous parts of the galaxies. For the bright galaxies we extracted individual\nJ, H and K frames from the 2MASS database, and showed the JHK composite image,\nwhich characterizes the distribution of old stellar populations in these galaxies. We also\nshowed the color-index image of each bright galaxy and of those dwarf galaxies for which\nreliable colors could be obtained above the noise level. It is especially useful to visualize\nthe stellar population and dust distribution. The parameters describing the axis-ratio\n(b/a) and the orientation (P.A) of the galaxy isophotes were calculated as an average\nobtained from fitting ellipses typically to the range of isophotes 24 - 25.5 B/\u2737\u2032\u2032 . In order\nto quantify the irregularities in optical morphology of the outer disk of regular galaxies,\nwe calculated the decentering degree as the displacement of the center of the most external\nisophote with respect to the luminosity center, normalized to the last measured radius\n(Marquez & Moles 1999).\nHere we present an abridged version of the obtained results for the parent galaxy IC\n65 (Fig. 3) as well as for all four new probable dwarf members of the group (Figs. 4 - 7).\nMore results for all studied galaxies are given in Vennik & Hopp (2004).\n\n8\n\nDiscussion and summary\n\nTo our present knowledge, groups of galaxies are a proper place to study interactions\nsince the galaxy encounters in groups occur at lower velocities, compared to the clusters\nof galaxies, and may lead to efficient merging events. Dominant luminous galaxies in the\ngroup can potentially reveal the history and evolutionary status of the respective system.\nOld groups usually contain one or several luminous ellipticals, which may have formed in\nmerging episodes and could have structures reminiscent of past interaction events. On the\nother hand, pure spiral groups should be dynamically younger aggregates. Their members\ncould reveal ongoing interaction through morphological distortions and in their possibly\ntriggered star-formation activity (Tanvuia et al. 2003). The dynamically youngest groups\nare good places to look for galaxies evolving at z \u223c 0.\nThe analysis (of available photometric and kinematic data) for the IC 65 group of\ngalaxies leads to the following results:\n\u2022 This particular compact group of four luminous late type spiral galaxies is well isolated\nboth in redshifts and in projection to the sky. We could identify four LSB dwarf companion candidates on deep DSS 2 frames according to their SB, color and morphology.\n\u2022 Available HI imaging data show that all bright members and at least one new dwarf\ncompanion are rich in HI with HI-mass to blue luminosity ratios in the range of 0.4 \u2013 1.2.\nTheir HI halos are typically twice as extended as the optical Holmberg radii of individual\ngalaxies. The outer HI isophotes (with column densities in the range of 2.3 \u2013 8.6 \u00d71020\natoms cm\u22122 ) generally appear disturbed, especially in IC 65 and in UGC 622 (see Fig. 1).\n\u2022 Optical morphology of bright galaxies generally appears to be regular, with minor disturbances in outer isophotes: e.g. in IC 65 the decentering degree is \u223c 8.2 % and in UGC\n622 \u2013 \u223c 6.3%, which are significantly larger than the average decentering of 2.4 \u00b1 2.7 %,\nfound by Marquez & Moles (1999) for isolated spirals.\n\u2022 All bright group members (except PGC 138291, which we could not study in such detail) consist of many blue star-forming knots and plumes, especially UGC 608.\n\u2022 UGC 622 is a Scd galaxy without a classical bulge, but containing a tiny bright nucleus.\n\n\fIt shows type II SB profile with two exponential sections of different scale lengths.\n\u2022 New probable dwarf companions are all of irregular appearance with blue knots, especially A 0101+4744 and A 0100+4734, for which a chain of blue SF patches give a\ncometary appearance.\n\u2022 Significant positive color gradients were found in LSB dwarf galaxies of short scale\nlengths, and they are related to starbursts. Late type dwarfs generally show a stellar\npopulation gradient, i.e. younger and bluer stars are more centrally concentrated and\nredder stars dominate the underlying older disk component.\nMorphologically disruptive interactions are expected to be more common in lowvelocity-dispersion (\u03c3v ) less evolved groups such as the Local Group and the M 81 group\n(Zabludoff 2001). The IC 65 group of galaxies obviously belongs to the class of less\nevolved groups: with its \u03c3v = 70 km/s, observed drift in optical isophotes and obvious\ntidal features in HI outer isophotes, as well as with the evidence of enhanced SF activity\nin fragile dwarf companion candidates let us conclude that the IC 65 group of galaxies is\nprobably dynamically young and possibly at the stage of its collapse.\n\n9\n\nReferences\n\nAndredakis, Y.C., Peletier, R.F., Balcells, M., 1995, MNRAS, 275, 874\nBender R., M\u00f6llenhoff C., 1987, A&A 177, 71\nBertin, E., Arnouts, S., 1996, A&AS, 117,393\nBinggeli B., 1994, in: G.Hensler, C.Theis, J.S.Gallagher (eds), \"The panchromatic view\nof galaxies\", Editions Frontier, p. 173\nChristian C.A., Adams M., Barnes J.V., Butcher H., Mould J.R., Siegel M., 1985, PASP\n97, 363\nFerguson, H.C., Binggeli, B., 1994, A&ARv., 6, 67\nFreeman, K.C, 1970, ApJ, 160, 811\nGarcia, A.M., 1993, A&AS, 100,47\nLorenz H., Richter G.M., Capaccioli M., Longo G., 1993, A&A 277, 321\nMarquez, I., Moles, M., 1999, A&A, 344, 421\nSersic, J.L., 1968, Atlas de galaxias australes.

Upper left: B-band image depicts an\nelliptical central bulge and/or a bar, at the ends of which a long symmetric double-armed\nspiral pattern starts, which includes many luminous knots and patches \u2013 HII regions.\nUpper center: B \u2212 R color-index image shows that knotty spiral arms are blue (i.e. light\nshade), with typical colors in the range of 0.7 \u2212 0.95 mag. The central elliptical bulge\nand the bar are red (dark shade) with < B \u2212 R >c \u2243 1.55, i.e. this component consists\nof old stars and dust. Upper right: the 2MASS JHK composite image appears smoother\nthan the optical image; it is dominated by an old stellar population and less affected by\ndust. K-band Laplacian contours (white) delineate the nucleus and the bar as well as two\nround features beyond the end of the bar, which may be intersections of an inner tilted\nring with the plane of sky. The center of the fitted free ellipses is systematically drifting to\nthe SE, both in optical and NIR bands (decentering \u223c 8 %, see text). This is opposite to\nthe global HI distribution, which shows an extension to the NW (see Fig. 1). Lower left:\na small bulge and/or a nucleus (within \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 ) and a bar component could be identified\nboth in optical and NIR SB profiles, followed by an extended nearly exponential disk,\nvisible in optical bands.The B+D fit to the optical SB profiles is denoted by a continuous\nline. Lower right: the optical and NIR color-index profiles show red bulge + bar area\nwithin \u223c 25\u2032\u2032 , followed by a nearly homogeneous disk, but still with some blueing towards\nthe periphery, which is an effect of blue spiral arms. Large gradients in the optical minus\nNIR colors probably show the occurence of dust in the bar region.\n\n\fFigure 4: Upper left: an anonymous irregular LSB galaxy A 0101+4744 of cometary\nappearance, with its brightest and bluest (B \u2212 R = 0.65, R \u2212 I = 0.1) star-forming (SF)\nknot B located in the western part and a diffuse curved tail on the opposite side. Other\ndiffuse knots A and C are redder (< B \u2212 R >c = 1.0 \u2212 1.2). We could distinguish galactic\nstars (1, 2 and 3) from SF knots by their stellar PSF and/or their typically redder colors.\nUpper right: B \u2212 R color-index image in the range 0.0 - 1.5 mag; the dark shade is red,\nthe light shade is blue. Pixels with counts less than 2\u03c3 of the background are flagged out.\nLower left: light distribution of the underlying stellar component is nearly exponential.\nLower right: B \u2212 R color-index profile (centered on knot B) shows significant reddening\ntowards the periphery. The HI radial velocity, measured by van Moorsel (1983), confirms\nthe membership of this particular dwarf galaxy (MB = \u221215.4, D25 \u2243 5 kpc, exp. sc.\nlength h \u2243 0.7 kpc) in this group.\n\n\fFigure 5: Left: an anonymous irregular LSB galaxy A 0100+4734, located \u223c 10\u2032 to the\nSW of IC 65; consists of a chain of four (blue) SF knots (A, B, C and D) with the\nbrightest and the bluest knot D located at the eastern periphery and, therefore, giving\nthe galaxy a cometary appearance. Galactic star - 1, projecting to the diffuse halo of the\ngalaxy, is much redder than the SF knots. Right: a 2.5\u2032\u2032 wide rectangular strip, extracted\nalong the major axis intersects all major SF knots, which reveal a range of colors with\nfainter knots getting redder along the distance from the brightest/bluest knot D. These\ncolor variations could be interpreted either as an age effect in the self-propagating SF\nmode or as an effect of inhomogenities in the dust distribution. The galaxy has been\nmarginally detected in HI during the pilot observations, made by Huchtmeier (2002) in\nJuly 2002 with Effelberg's 100-m radio telescope (HPBW = 9.3\u2032 ) in the redshift range of\nthe group. However, this detection should be confirmed with better angular resolution.\n\n\fFigure 6: A very faint LSB irregular object A 0100+4756 showing a smooth light distribution (left panel) with a maximum SB \u2243 24.0 B/\u2737\u2032\u2032 , exponential light profile (upper\nright) and with homogeneous blue (< B \u2212 R >c \u2243 0.76 \u00b1 0.2, < R \u2212 I >c \u2243 0.15 \u00b1 0.2)\ncolor profile (lower right). The color characteristics are similar to those of A 0101+4744 \u2013\nthe confirmed dwarf member of this group. The dwarfish morphology and location close\nto the UGC 622 (\u223c 5\u2032 ) let us consider this object for a possible member of this group. In\nthis case, its main photometric parameters are: MB = \u221214.4, D \u2243 3.6 kpc, h \u2243 1.0 kpc.\nAlternatively, this peculiar object could also be an isolated fragment of a faint Galactic\nreflection nebula.\n\n\fFigure 7: An irregular LSB galaxy A 0101+4752 with two faint arc-like features, one\nstreching to the North with the (red) stellar knot 2 at its end and another shorter arc\nending at a resolved knot A. Both arcs, marginally visible on the BR composite CCD\nimage (left panel), are confirmed by deeper (but low resolution) DSS 2 frames. Another\nresolved knot B is extremely blue: (B \u2212 R)c \u2243 0.3. Light distribution of the underlying\nstellar component is nearly exponential (upper right). The B \u2212R color-index profile (lower\nright), starting from the bluest knot B shows clear reddening towards the periphery.\nMorphological features, as the absence of the regular spiral structure and the occurrence\nof several blue SF (?) knots let us consider this object as a relatively nearby dwarf\ngalaxy. When associated with the IC 65 group, its photometric characteristics ( MB =\n\u221214.9, D \u2243 4.5 kpc, h \u2243 0.8 kpc, < B \u2212 R >c \u2243 0.7, < R \u2212 I >c \u2243 0.2) are rather typical\nfor an irregular dwarf galaxy with slow star formation.\n\n\f"}
