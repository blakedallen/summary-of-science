Dwyer, Weiss, and Williams have recently defined the notions of the parametrized\ntopological Euler characteristic and the parametrized topological Reidemeister torsion\nwhich are invariants of bundles of compact topological manifolds. We show that these\ninvariants satisfy additivity formulas paralleling the additive properties of the classical\nEuler characteristic and the Reidemeister torsion of CW \u2013complexes.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years various attempts have been made to generalize the classical Reidemeister torsion (which is an invariant of non-simply connected finite CW complexes) to a\nparametrized version, i.e. to an invariant of fiber bundles. One such generalization is the\nnotion of an analytic torsion introduced by Bismut and Lott [1]. It is defined for bundles of\nsmooth manifolds satisfying some additional conditions. Another definition was proposed\nby Igusa and Klein [12],[11] who construct parametrized Reidemeister torsion - also for\nbundles of smooth manifolds - using generalized Morse functions.\nOur main interest in this paper lies in yet another definition of torsion developed by\nDwyer, Weiss and Williams [5]. One of the main features of their construction is that it is\ndescribed in the language of the homotopy theory which makes it relatively simple. Briefly,\nit proceeds as follows. Given a manifold M and a locally constant sheaf of R-modules\n\u03c1 : V \u2192 M such that the homology groups H\u2217 (M, \u03c1) vanish, the classical Reidemeister\ntorsion of M can be defined as an element of a group Wh(\u03c1) which is a certain quotient\nof K1 (R). Let Q(M+ ) denote the infinite loops space associated with the suspension\nspectrum of M . The starting point for the construction of Dwyer, Weiss and Williams is\nthe observation that the group Wh(\u03c1) can be identified with \u03c00 \u03a6s\u03c1 (M ) where where \u03a6s\u03c1 (M )\nis the homotopy fiber of a certain map \u03bb : Q(M+ ) \u2192 K(R) defined in terms of the sheaf\n\u03c1. It follows that the classical torsion of M determines a connectedness component of\n\u03a6s\u03c1 (M ). In fact, more is true: one can construct the torsion invariant as a unique point\n\u03c4\u03c1s (M ) \u2208 \u03a6s\u03c1 (M ). Assume now that we are given a smooth bundle p : E \u2192 B and a sheaf of\nR-modules \u03c1 : V \u2192 E such that the homology groups of the fibers Mb of p with coefficients\nin \u03c1|Mb vanish. For every b \u2208 B we obtain a point \u03c4\u03c1s (Mb ) \u2208 \u03a6s\u03c1 (Mb ). The spaces \u03a6s\u03c1 (Mb )\ncan be glued together using the topology of the bundle p in such way that we obtain a\nfibration \u03a6s\u03c1 (p) \u2192 B. The assignment b 7\u2192 \u03c4\u03c1s (Mb ) defines then a section \u03c4\u03c1s (p) of this\nfibration which can be interpreted as a parametrized smooth torsion of the bundle p.\nDate: 05/10/2007.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W. DORABIALA\n\nAn advantage of the construction of torsion sketched above is its flexibility: while \u03c4\u03c1s (p)\nis defined for smooth bundles of manifolds, its variants can be used to extend the notion of\nparametrized torsion to more general settings. In fact, Dwyer, Weiss and Williams gave two\nadditional versions of their definition. The homotopy Reidemeister torsion \u03c4\u03c1h (p) is defined\nfor any fibration p : E \u2192 B with homotopy finitely dominated fibers and is obtained just\nas the smooth torsion, but with Q(M+ ) replaced by A(M ) \u2013 the Waldhausen A-theory of\nM . The topological Reidemeister torsion \u03c4\u03c1t (p) exists whenever p : E \u2192 B happens to be\na bundle of compact topological manifolds and is constructed using A% (M ) - the excisive\nversion of the A-theory.\nEach of these invariants takes values in a different infinite loop space; thus topological\ntorsion of a smooth bundle is not the same as its smooth torsion, but it can be seen as an\napproximation of the smooth torsion. Similarly, homotopy torsion can be considered as an\napproximation of the topological torsion when both are defined.\nThe work of Goette [8],[9] and Igusa extended our understanding of the relationship\nbetween the analytical torsion of Bismut\u2013Lott and the torsion of Igusa\u2013Klein. It is far less\nclear, however, how these notions relate to the smooth torsion of Dwyer\u2013Weiss\u2013Williams.\nOur goal here is to bring these constructions closer together. The starting point is an\naxiomatization of parametrized Reidemeister torsion proposed by Igusa [10]. He showed\nthat if a cohomological version of torsion of smooth bundles satisfies two conditions, then\nit is unique up to a scalar multiple. The first condition is the product formula relating the\ntorsion of a composition of two fibrations p2 \u25e6 p1 to the torsion of p1 and p2 . The second\ncondition is additivity, which describes the torsion of a pushout of bundles over a space\nB. In [2] the second author showed that a homotopy theoretical analog of additivity is\nsatisfied by the homotopy torsion of Dwyer, Weiss and Williams. The main result of our\npresent paper shows that additivity holds also for the topological torsion \u03c4\u03c1t .\n1.1. Definition. Let p : E \u2192 B be a bundle of closed topological manifolds. We say\nthat p admits a fiberwise codimension one splitting if there are subbundles of manifolds\npi : Ei \u2192 B (i = 0, 1, 2) such that E = E1 \u222aE0 E2 , fibers of p1 , p2 are compact submanifolds\n(with boundary) of the fibers of p, and the fibers of p0 are the common boundary of the\nfibers of p1 and p2 .\n1.2. Theorem. Suppose that p : E \u2192 B is a bundle of closed manifolds which admits\na fiberwise codimension one splitting into subbundles pi : Ei \u2192 B for i = 0, 1, 2. Let R\nbe a ring and \u03c1 : V \u2192 E be a locally constant sheaf of finitely generated projective left\nR-modules. Finally, assume that H\u2217 (p\u22121 (b); \u03c1) = 0 and H\u2217 (p\u22121\ni (b); \u03c1|Ei ) = 0 for i = 0, 1, 2\nand all b \u2208 B. Then there exists a preferred homotopy class of paths in the topological\nWhitehead space \u03a6t\u03c1 (p) joining \u03c4\u03c1t (p) with j1\u2217 \u03c4\u03c1t (p1 ) + j2\u2217 \u03c4\u03c1t (p2 ) \u2212 j0\u2217 \u03c4\u03c1t (p0 ), where ji\u2217 is the\nmap induced by the inclusion ji : Ei ,\u2192 E.\nThe definitions of \u03a6t\u03c1 (p) and \u03c4\u03c1t (p) are recalled in Section 2. We note that this property\nof \u03c4\u03c1t parallels the additivity of the classical combinatorial Reidemeister torsion relating\ntorsion of a finite CW\u2013complex X \u222aZ Y to the torsions of X, Y and Z.\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n3\n\nWhile the proof of Theorem 1.2 is more subtle than in the case of homotopy torsion, the\nessential idea is to reduce the problem to additivity of \u03c4\u03c1h and then use the arguments of\n[2]. We expect that, similarly, a proof of the additivity for smooth torsion may be obtained\nby reduction to topological case and application of Theorem 1.2.\nThe main component of the proof of Theorem 1.2 is the additivity theorem for the\ntopological Euler characteristic:\n1.3. Theorem. Let p : E \u2192 B be a fiber bundle of closed topological manifolds admitting a\nfiberwise codimension one splitting as in Theorem 1.2. There exists a preferred homotopy\nclass of paths in A% (p) joining \u03c7t (p) with j1\u2217 \u03c7t (p1 ) + j2\u2217 \u03c7t (p2 ) \u2212 j0\u2217 \u03c7t (p0 ).\nThe space A% (p) denotes here the parametrized excisive A-theory of p, and \u03c7t (p) \u2208 A% (p)\nis the topological Euler characteristic of p. Again, definitions of these notions are sketched\nin Section 2.\nIn the present paper Theorem 1.3 serves as a step in establishing the additivity of\ntopological torsion, but it has also other potential applications. One of the main results\nof [5] says that a bundle of compact manifolds p : E \u2192 B is fiber homotopy equivalent\nto a smooth bundle if and only if \u03c7t (p) can be lifted to the infinite loop space associated\nwith the parametrized suspension spectrum of p. From this perspective additivity of the\ntopological Euler characteristic provides a tool for computing an obstruction for smoothing\nof the bundle p.\n1.4. Organization of the paper. In Section 2 we recall the constructions of Dwyer,\nWeiss, and Williams. In their setting the topological (resp. homotopy) Reidemeister\ntorsion can be thought of as a lift of the parametrized topological (resp. homotopy) Euler\ncharacteristic. In order to prove additivity for \u03c4\u03c1t it is then enough to verify that additivity\nholds for the topological Euler characteristic, and then show that we can lift the resulting\npath. As the first step we demonstrate (\u00a73) that excisive Euler characteristic is additive in\nnon-parametrized case, that is for bundles over a one-point space. In Section 4 we show how\nto extend this result to bundles of manifolds with a discrete structure group. Subsequently\nin \u00a75 we show that additivity of the Euler characteristic for arbitrary bundles follows from\nadditivity for certain universal bundles. Then, in Section 6 we show that additivity for the\nuniversal bundles follows from additivity of the topological Euler characteristic for bundles\nwith a discrete structure groups. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.3. Finally, in\nSection 7 we prove Theorem 1.2.\nAcknowledgments. The authors wish to thank Bruce Williams for conversations which\ncontributed to this work. Comments of the referee helped to clarify several passages.\n2. Dwyer-Weiss-Williams constructions\nThe purpose of this section is to provide a quick review of constructions leading to the\ndefinition of the topological Reidemeister torsion. We refer to [5] for a detailed treatment\nof this subject. We also set here the notation which we will use throughout the paper. In\ngeneral we tried to preserve the notation of [5], although some differences occur.\n\n\f4\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W. DORABIALA\n\n2.1. Non-parametrized Euler characteristics. By a Waldhausen category we will\nmean a category C together with a choice of two subcategories: a subcategory of cofibrations\nand a subcategory of weak equivalences satisfying the axioms of [21] (in the terminology\nof [21] such a category C is called a category with cofibrations and weak equivalences).\nApplying the S\u2022 -construction to C one obtains \u03a9|wS\u2022 C| \u2013 the K-theory space of C [22, 1.3].\nThis is an infinite loop space which we will denote by K(C). Every object c \u2208 C represents\na point [c] \u2208 K(C), and a weak equivalence \u03c6 : c \u2192 c0 determines a path from [c] to [c0 ].\nAn exact functor of Waldhausen categories F : C \u2192 D is a functor preserving the distinguished subcategories and all other relevant structures. Any such functor induces a\nmap of the associated infinite loop spaces F\u2217 : K(C) \u2192 K(D). The functor C \u00d7 C \u2192 C\nwhich assigns to a pair of objects (c, c0 ) their coproduct c \u2228 c0 in C is exact and defines\na map K(C) \u00d7 K(C) \u2192 K(C). This equips K(C) with an H-space structure such that\n[c] + [c0 ] = [c \u2228 c0 ]. If we have defined a suspension functor \u03a3 : C \u2192 C [22, p. 349] then\nthe map K(C) \u2192 K(C) induced by \u03a3 represents a homotopy inverse with respect to the\nH-space structure on K(C). Thus, for c \u2208 C we can write \u2212[c] := [\u03a3c]. All Waldhausen\ncategories considered here come equipped with suspension functors.\nIf c \u2192 c0 \u2192 c00 is a cofibration sequence in C then there is a path in K(C) joining [c0 ]\nwith [c] + [c00 ]. One way to get such a path is to use Waldhausen's additivity theorem [22,\nProp. 1.3.2]. Another way is to observe that (in the notation of [22, 1.3]) a cofibration\nsequence c \u2192 c0 \u2192 c00 defines a point [c \u2192 c0 \u2192 c00 ] \u2208 |wS2 C|. The restriction of the map\n|wS2 C| \u00d7 \u22062 \u2192 |wS\u2022 C| to [c \u2192 c0 \u2192 c00 ] \u00d7 \u22062 yields the desired path [22, 1.3.3]. This\nsecond construction is more explicit and easily adapts to the parametrized setting (see\nLemma 4.3). This is the construction we are using throughout the paper.\nFollowing [5, p. 40] we will denote by Rf d (X) the category of homotopy finitely dominated retractive spaces over X. The objects of Rf d (X) are diagrams\nYo\n\nr\ns\n\n/X\n\nsuch that r \u25e6 s = idX , s is a cofibration, and Y is a homotopy finitely dominated space over\nX. The category Rf d (X) can be equipped with a Waldhausen category structure where a\nmorphism in Rf d (X) is a weak equivalence or a cofibration if its underlying map of spaces\nis a homotopy equivalence or, respectively, a map with the homotopy extension property.\nIts K-theory space is denoted A(X) and called the A-theory of X.\n2.2. Definition. Let X be a finitely dominated space. The characteristic object X h \u2208\nRf d (X) is the retractive space\nX \u00d7 {\u22121, 1} o\n\nr\ns\n\n/X\n\nwhere s(X) = X \u00d7 {\u22121}, and r is the projection map. The homotopy Euler characteristic\nof X is the point \u03c7h (X) \u2208 A(X) represented by X h .\nThe assignment X 7\u2192 A(X) defines a functor on the category of finitely dominated\nspaces. It is not a homology theory since it does not satisfy the excision axiom. By\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n5\n\n[23] there exists a functor X \u2192 A% (X) which in a certain sense is the best possible\napproximation of A(\u2212) by an excisive functor. In [5, \u00a77] the authors show that if X is an\nEuclidean neighborhood retract (ENR) then A% (X) can be explicitly constructed using\nWaldhausen categories. We outline this construction next.\nFor an ENR space X we have a category Rld (JX) the objects of which are diagrams\nYo\n\nr\ns\n\n/ X \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\n\nsuch that r \u25e6 s = idX\u00d7[0,\u221e) and where Y is homotopy locally finitely dominated as a space\nover X \u00d7 [0, \u221e) [5, p.48]. Morphisms in Rld (JX) are retractive maps. Given objects\nri : Yi \u001d X \u00d7 [0, \u221e) : si for i = 1, 2 and morphisms f, g : Y1 \u2192 Y2 we have the notion of\ncontrolled homotopy between f and g. By this we mean a map H : Y1 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 Y2 which\ngives a homotopy between f and g in the usual sense and which commutes with the maps\ns1 , s2 , but commutes with the retractions r1 , r2 only in a relaxed, controlled way [5, p. 47].\nThe category Rld (JX) can be equipped with a Waldhausen category structure where weak\nequivalences are controlled homotopy equivalences and cofibrations are the maps with the\ncontrolled homotopy extension property. The K-theory space of Rld (JX) will be denoted\nby AJ (X).\nWe have a functor\nI : Rf d (X) \u2192 Rld (JX)\nwhich assigns to a retractive space r : Y \u001d X : s over X a retractive space over X \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\nYo\n\n/ X \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\n\nwhere Y is a pushout in the diagram\n/ X \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\n\nX = X \u00d7 {0}\ns\n\n\u000f\n/Y\n\n\u000f\n\nY\n\nThe functor I is an embedding of categories, and \u2013 considered as a functor of Waldhausen\ncategories \u2013 it is exact so it induces a map of the K-theory spaces\nI\u2217 : A(X) \u2192 AJ (X)\nNext, let V(X) denote the category of proper retractive ENRs over X \u00d7 [0, \u221e). This\nis a subcategory of Rld (JX) whose objects r : Y \u001d X \u00d7 [0, \u221e) : s satisfy the conditions\nthat Y is an ENR and that r is a proper map [5, 7.8]. Let J : V(X) \u2192 Rld (JX) be the\ninclusion functor. The category V(X) admits a Waldhausen category structure such that\nJ becomes an exact functor [5, p. 51]. As a consequence we obtain an infinite loop space\nV (X) := K(V(X)) and a map J\u2217 : V (X) \u2192 AJ (X).\n2.3. Definition. Let X be a compact ENR. The space A% (X) is the homotopy limit\nI\n\nJ\n\nA% (X) := holim (A(X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2217\u2212\u2192 AJ (X) \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2217\u2212\u2212 V (X))\n\n\f6\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W. DORABIALA\n\nWe call A% (X) the excisive A-theory of X. The natural map \u03b1 : A% (X) \u2192 A(X) is called\nthe assembly map.\n2.4. Remark. 1) In [5, \u00a77] the space A% (X) is defined in somewhat different manner, as a\nhomotopy fiber of a map V (X) \u2192 K(RG ld (X)) where RG ld (X) is the Waldhausen category\nwith the same objects as Rld (JX) but with germs of retractive maps as morphisms. The\nresulting infinite loop space is however homotopy equivalent to the one described above\n(see [5, Lemma 8.7]).\n2) The space V (X) is in fact contractible [5, p.52], so A% (X) is equivalent to a homotopy\nfiber of the map I\u2217 . The above description of A% (X) allows us however to perform certain\nconstructions in A% (X) combinatorially, on the level of Waldhausen categories as follows.\nFor a compact ENR X let R% (X) denote the pullback of the diagram of categories\nI\n\nJ\n\nRf d (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Rld (JX) \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 V(X)\nThus, objects of R% (X) are pairs (a, b) where a \u2208 Rf d (X), b \u2208 V(X), and I(a) = J(b),\nand morphisms are defined similarly. The category R% (X) has the obvious structure of\na Waldhausen category such that the functors R% (X) \u2192 Rf d (X), R% (X) \u2192 V(X) are\nexact. It follows that we have a commutative diagram of infinite loop spaces:\nK(R% (X))\n\n/ V (X)\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ AJ (X)\n\nA(X)\n\nAs a consequence we obtain a map K(R% (X)) \u2192 A% (X). In particular any object (a, b) \u2208\nR% (X) determines a point [a, b] \u2208 A% (X), a weak equivalence (a, b) \u2192 (a0 , b0 ) defines a\npath from [a, b] to [a0 , b0 ], and a cofibration sequence\n(a, b) \u2192 (a0 , b0 ) \u2192 (a00 , b00 )\nin R% (X) determines a path in A% (X) joining [a0 , b0 ] with [a, b] + [a00 , b00 ]. It will be\nsometimes convenient to describe points and paths in A% (X) in this way.\nWe are now ready to define the topological Euler characteristic of a space.\n2.5. Definition. Let X be an ENR. The characteristic object of X in V(X) is the object\nX v given by the retractive space\nX \u00d7 {0} t X \u00d7 [0, \u221e) o\n\n/ X \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\n\nThe topological Euler characteristic of X is the point \u03c7t (X) \u2208 A% (X) determined by the\nobject X t := (X h , X v ) \u2208 R% (X).\nNotice that we have \u03b1(\u03c7t (X)) = \u03c7h (X).\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n7\n\n2.6. Remark. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a map of spaces. By abuse of notation by f\u2217 we will\ndenote each of the functors induced by f : Rf d (X) \u2192 Rf d (Y ), V(X) \u2192 V(Y ), Rld (JX) \u2192\nRld (JY ), and R% (X) \u2192 R% (Y ), as well as the maps of infinite loop spaces: A(X) \u2192 A(Y ),\nV (X) \u2192 V (Y ), AJ (X) \u2192 AJ (Y ), and A% (X) \u2192 A% (Y ).\nEuler characteristics are not preserved in general by the maps f\u2217 . However, we have the\nfollowing\n2.7. Lemma. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a homotopy equivalence of finitely dominated spaces. We\nhave a canonical weak equivalence f h : f\u2217 (X h ) \u2192 Y h in Rf d (Y ). Moreover, if g : Y \u2192 Z\nis another homotopy equivalence, then (gf )h = g h \u25e6 g\u2217 (f h ).\nProof. Define\nf h := f t id : f\u2217 (X h ) = X t Y \u2192 Y t Y\nThe properties of f h are straightforward to check.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.8. Corollary. If f : X \u2192 Y is a homotopy equivalence of finitely dominated spaces then\nthere is a canonical path \u03c9f from f\u2217 \u03c7h (X) to \u03c7h (Y ).\n2.9. Lemma. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a cell-like map [15], [13], [14] of compact ENRs. We have\na canonical weak equivalence f v : f\u2217 (X v ) \u2192 Y v in V(X). Moreover the weak equivalences\nf h and f v satisfy the equations I(f h ) = J(f v ), and so they define a weak equivalence\nf t := (f h , f v ) : f\u2217 (X t ) \u2192 Y t in R% (Y ). The weak equivalences f v and f t satisfy a cochain\ncondition analogous to the one described in Lemma 2.7.\nProof. The map f v is given by\nf v := f t id : f\u2217 (X v ) = X t Y \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u2192 Y t Y \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\nIt is a weak equivalence in V(X) by [5, p. 53]. Verification of the remaining properties of\nf v is straightforward.\n\u0003\n2.10. Corollary. If f : X \u2192 Y is a cell-like map of compact ENRs then there is a canonical\npath \u03c3f joining f\u2217 (\u03c7t (X)) with \u03c7t (Y ). Moreover, if a : A% (X) \u2192 A(X) is the assembly\nmap, then a(\u03c3f ) = \u03c9f where \u03c9f is the path from Lemma 2.8.\nWe will refer to the properties of \u03c7h (\u2212) and \u03c7t (\u2212) described in Corollaries 2.8 and 2.10 as\nthe lax naturality of Euler characteristics.\n2.11. Parametrization. The constructions sketched above can be generalized to the\np\nsetting where the space X is replaced by a fibration E \u2192 B with a fiber F . Intuitively,\none can construct in this case a fibration AB (E) \u2192 B the fiber of which is A(F ). An\nanalog of the homotopy Euler characteristic in this context is a section of this fibration\nwhich restricts to \u03c7h (F ) over every point of B. A similar idea underlies the notions of\nthe parametrized excisive A-theory and the parametrized topological Euler characteristic.\nFor technical reasons it is more convenient, however, to define the parametrized Euler\ncharacteristics in different terms. We give these formal definitions first, and then explain\nhow they relate to the above idea.\n\n\f8\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W. DORABIALA\n\nLet C be a small category, and let F : C \u2192 Spaces be a functor. Recall that holim C F is\nthe space of natural transformations\nholim F := MapC (|C/ \u2212 |, F )\nC\n\nwhere |C/ \u2212 | is the functor which assigns to c \u2208 C the nerve of the overcategory C/c. The\nfollowing fact is implicitly present in [5]:\n2.12. Lemma. Let WCat denote the category of Waldhausen categories with exact functors\nas morphisms. Assume that for a functor F : C \u2192 WCat we have a rule which assigns to\nc \u2208 C an object c! \u2208 F (c), and to f \u2208 MorC (c, d) a weak equivalence f ! : F (f )(c! ) \u2192 d! in\nF (d) in such way that (g \u25e6 f )! = g ! \u25e6 F (f )(f ! ). Then the assignment |C/c| 7\u2192 [c! ] defines a\npoint [c! , f ! ] \u2208 holim C K(F (c)).\nIndeed, if wF (c) denotes the subcategory of weak equivalences in the Waldhausen category F (c), then the assignments c 7\u2192 c! , f 7\u2192 f ! as in Lemma 2.12 define a point in\nholim C |wF (c)| (where |wF (c)| is the nerve of wF (c)). Using the natural transformation\nof functors |wF (c)| \u2192 K(F (c)) we obtain a point in holim C K(F (c)) as claimed.\nNow, let B : \u2206op \u2192 Sets be a simplicial set. Denote by S(B) the category whose objects\nare all simplices x \u2208 B, and where morphisms x \u2192 y in S(B) come from morphisms \u03c6\nin \u2206op satisfying B(\u03c6)(y) = x (thus S(B) is the opposite category of the Grothendieck\nconstruction on the functor B [4, p.22]). Let B be the geometric realization of B, and\nfor x \u2208 B let \u03c6x : \u2206|x| \u2192 B denote the characteristic map of x. Assume that we have a\np\nfibration E \u2192 B with a homotopy finitely dominated fiber F . We can define a functor\nS(B) \u2192 Spaces,\np\n\nx 7\u2192 Ex\n\n\u03c6x\n\nwhere Ex := lim(E \u2192 B \u2190 \u2206|x| ). As a result we get a functor\nF : S(B) \u2192 WCat,\n\nx 7\u2192 Rf d (Ex )\n\nFor x \u2208 S(B) consider the assignment x 7\u2192 Exh where Exh \u2208 Rf d (X) is the characteristic object of Ex (2.2). Notice that for any morphism f : x \u2192 y in S(B) the map\nF (f ) : Ex \u2192 Ey is a homotopy equivalence, so by Lemma 2.7 it defines a weak equivalence F (f )h : F (f )\u2217 (Exh ) \u2192 Eyh in Rf d (Ey ) . Lemma 2.7 also shows that the assignments\nx 7\u2192 Exh , f 7\u2192 F (f )h satisfy the conditions Lemma 2.12, and so they define a point\n[Exh , F (f )h ] \u2208 holim A(Ex ).\nS(B)\n\np\n\n2.13. Definition. The homotopy Euler characteristic of a fibration E \u2192 B is the point\n[Exh , F (f )h ] \u2208 holim A(Ex ). We will write \u03c7h (p) := [Exh , F (f )h ].\nS(B)\n\nNext, notice that the constant maps A(Ex ) \u2192 \u2217 define a map of homotopy colimits\np\u2217 : hocolim A(Ex ) \u2192 hocolim \u2217 = B\nS(B)\n\nS(B)\n\nwhich by [7, p.180] is a quasi-fibration with the fiber A(F ). Let p\u2217 : AB (E) \u2192 B be the\nfibration associated to this quasi-fibration. For all morphisms x \u2192 y in S(B) the map\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n9\n\nEx \u2192 Ey is a homotopy equivalence, and thus so is the map A(Ex ) \u2192 A(Ey ). Therefore\nas an application of [3, Prop. 3.12] we obtain\n2.14. Proposition. The map\nholim A(Ex ) = MapS(B) (|S(B)/\u2212|, A(E(\u2212) )) \u2192 MapB (hocolim |S(B)/x|, hocolim A(Ex ))\nx\u2208S(B)\n\nx\u2208S(B)\n\nx\u2208S(B)\n\nf 7\u2192 hocolim f\nis a weak equivalence.\nHere MapB (\u2212, \u2212) denotes the mapping space of spaces over B. Also, in the category of\nspaces over B we have weak equivalences\nhocolim |S(B)/x| ' B\n\nhocolim A(Ex ) ' AB (E)\n\nand\n\nx\u2208S(B)\n\nx\u2208S(B)\n\nwhich combined with Proposition 2.14 give\nholim A(Ex ) ' MapB (B, AB (E))\nx\u2208S(B)\n\nIt follows that\n\n\u03c7h (p)\n\n\u2208 holim A(Ex ) defines a point (unique up to a contractible space of\n\nchoices) in \u0393(p\u2217 ) \u2013 the space of sections of the fibration p\u2217 : AB (E) \u2192 B. This brings us\nback to the intuitive construction of \u03c7h (p) sketched at the beginning of this section.\nAs we have mentioned above the idea behind the definition of the parametrized topological characteristic \u03c7t (p) is similar. The details, however, are more involved. The problem is\nthat one cannot (mimicking Definition 2.13) define \u03c7t (p) using Lemmas 2.9 and 2.12 since\nthe maps Ex \u2192 Ey are usually not cell-like. In [5] the authors overcome this difficulty\nby replacing B with a new simplicial set pB, and the functor F : S(B) \u2192 Spaces by a\nnew functor tF : S(pB) \u2192 Spaces, which sends every morphism in S(pB) to a homeomorphism. Then the assumptions of Lemma 2.9 are satisfied and we can apply 2.12 in order\nto define a point in \u03c7t (p) \u2208 holim S(pB) A% (tF ). The details follow.\np\n\n2.15. Definition (Compare [5, p.13] ). Let E \u2192 B be a (locally trivial) fiber bundle, where\nB is the geometric realization of a simplicial set B. By pB we will denote the simplicial\nset whose k-simplices are pairs (x, \u03b8) where x a k-simplex in B, and \u03b8 is an equivalence\nrelation on Ex such that the quotient map Ex \u2192 Ex\u03b8 and the projection Ex \u2192 \u2206k give a\nhomeomorphism Ex \u2192 Ex\u03b8 \u00d7 \u2206k .\np\n\nNotice that if F is the fiber of the fiber bundle E \u2192 B then for every (x, \u03b8) \u2208 pB we\nhave Ex\u03b8 \u223c\n= F and the assignment (x, \u03b8) 7\u2192 Ex\u03b8 defines a functor tF : S(pB) \u2192 Spaces which\nsends every morphism in S(pB) to a homeomorphism.\np\n\n2.16. Definition. Let E \u2192 B be a fiber bundle whose fiber F is a compact ENR. The\nassignments (x, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (Ex\u03b8 )t (see 2.5) , and f 7\u2192 F (f )t (2.9), where f is a morphism in pB,\nsatisfy the conditions of Lemma 2.12. Therefore they define a point\n\u03c7t (p) := [(Ex\u03b8 )t , F (f )t ] \u2208 holim A% (Ex\u03b8 )\n(x,\u03b8)\u2208pB\n\n\f10\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W. DORABIALA\n\nWe call \u03c7t (p) the topological Euler characteristic of the bundle p.\nThe following fact lets us compare the homotopy and topological Euler characteristics\nof bundles.\np\n\n2.17. Proposition. Let E \u2192 B be a locally trivial fiber bundle whose fiber is a compact\ntopological manifold M (perhaps with boundary). We have a commutative diagram\nholim A% (Ex )\n\n'\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\nholim A(Ex )\nx\n\n/ holim A% (Ex )\n\n'\n\n(x,\u03b8)\n\nx\n\n'\n\n/ holim A% (Ex\u03b8 )\n(x,\u03b8)\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n/ holim A(Ex )\n\n'\n\n(x,\u03b8)\n\n\u03b1\n\n/ holim A(Ex\u03b8 )\n(x,\u03b8)\n\nThe vertical maps are induced by assembly maps. All horizontal maps are weak equivalences. The horizontal maps on the left are induced by the forgetful functor S(pB) \u2192 S(B),\nwhile the horizontal maps on the right come from the natural transformation Ex 7\u2192 Ex\u03b8 of\nfunctors over S(pB).\nThe maps on the right are weak equivalences by homotopy invariance of homotopy limits.\nThe maps on the left are weak equivalences by [5, Corollary 2.7].\n2.18. The implications of Proposition 2.17 are twofold. On one hand it lets us think about\n\u03c7t (p) as an element of holim x\u2208S(B) A% (Ex ) defined uniquely up to a contractible space\n%\nof choices. Similarly as in 2.14 we then get holim x\u2208S(B) A% (Ex ) ' \u0393(p%\n\u2217 ) where \u0393(p\u2217 )\n%\nis the space of sections of the fibration p%\n\u2217 : AB (E) \u2192 B associated to the quasi-fibration\n%\nhocolim x\u2208S(B) A (Ex ) \u2192 B with the fiber A% (M ). In particular we can think of \u03c7t (p)\nh\nas a section of p%\n\u2217 . On the other hand consider the image of \u03c7 (p) under the composition\nof the bottom maps in the diagram above. One can see that the point holim (x,\u03b8) A(Ex\u03b8 )\ndefined in this way can be explicitly described by means of Lemma 2.12 as coming from\nthe assignment (x, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (Ex\u03b8 )ah := Ex t Ex\u03b8 for any object (x, \u03b8) \u2208 S(pB), and f 7\u2192 f ah for\nany morphism f : (x, \u03b8) \u2192 (y, \u03b80 ) in S(pB) where f ah is the map\nf ah : tF (f )(Ex t Ex\u03b8 ) = Ey t Ex\u03b8\n\nidttF (f )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nEy t Ey\u03b8\n\n0\n\nWe can consider the element [(Ex\u03b8 )ah , f ah ] \u2208 holim (x,\u03b8) A(Ex\u03b8 ) as a re-definition of \u03c7h (p).\nUnlike the non-parametrized case this element is not equal of the image of \u03c7t (p) under the\nassembly map. However, the homotopy equivalences Ex t Ex\u03b8 \u2192 Ex\u03b8 t Ex\u03b8 define a canonical\npath \u03c3p in holim (x,\u03b8) A(Ex\u03b8 ), joining the image of \u03c7t (p) with the image of \u03c7h (p).\n2.19. Notation. We will denote by A(p) the homotopy limit holim x A(Ex ). Similarly,\nA% (p) will denote holim (x,\u03b8) A% (Ex\u03b8 ).\n2.20. Reidemeister Torsions. Let R be a (discrete) ring with identity, and let Chf d (R)\ndenote the category of chain complexes of left projective R-modules which are chain homotopy equivalent to finitely generated complexes. The category Chf d (R) can be equipped\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n11\n\nwith a Waldhausen category structure where weak equivalences are chain homotopy equivalences and cofibrations are chain maps which are split injective on every level. The infinite\nloop space K(Chf d (R)) is homotopy equivalent to the K-theory space of the ring R [5, p.\n43]. Thus, from now on we will denote K(Chf d (R)) by K(R).\nLet \u03c1 : V \u2192 E be a locally constant sheaf of projective modules. The sheaf \u03c1 induces\na functor L\u03c1 : Rf d (E) \u2192 Chf d (R) which assigns to any object (X \u001c E) \u2208 Rf d (E) the\nrelative singular chain complex C(X, E, \u03c1) with local coefficients given by \u03c1. The functor\nis L\u03c1 is not exact. It is however close enough to being exact that it still defines a map\nL\u03c1\u2217 : A(E) \u2192 K(R) if we slightly modify the construction of A(E) and K(R) using a variant\nof the S\u2022 -construction proposed by Thomason (see [5, p. 43]). Assume that H\u2217 (E, \u03c1) = 0.\nIn this case the complex L\u03c1 (E h ) is acyclic, so the map 0 \u2192 L\u03c1 (E h ) (where 0 is the zero\nchain complex) is a weak equivalence in Chf d (E). This gives a canonical path \u03c3\u03c1 (E) in\nK(R) joining L\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c7h (E)) with \u2217\u2013the basepoint of K(R) which is represented by the chain\ncomplex 0.\n2.21. Definition. The pair (\u03c7h (E), \u03c3\u03c1 (E)) defines a point in \u03a6h\u03c1 (E) - the homotopy fiber\nof the map L\u03c1\u2217 . This point is called the homotopy Reidemeister torsion of the space E\nand is denoted by \u03c4\u03c1h (E).\nIf E is a compact ENR then let \u03a6t\u03c1 (E) denote the homotopy fiber of the map L\u03c1\u2217 \u03b1 where\n\u03b1 is the assembly map.

In such case following [5, p. 66] we can define fibrations \u03a6h\u03c1,B (E) \u2192 B\nand \u03a6t\u03c1,B (E) \u2192 B with fibers \u03a6h\u03c1 (F ) and \u03a6t\u03c1 (F ) respectively. If H\u2217 (Ex , \u03c1|Ex ) = 0 for\nall x \u2208 B these fibrations admit sections which assign \u03c4\u03c1|h F (F ) (resp. \u03c4\u03c1|t F (F )) to every\npoint b \u2208 B. We can think of these sections as parametrized versions of the Reidemeister\ntorsions. However, similarly as it was the case for the parametrized Euler characteristics\n(2.11), this describes torsions only up to a contractible space of choices. We will then again\nneed other, more precise definitions.\nFor x \u2208 S(B) consider the maps Ex \u2192 E. The induced functors of Waldhausen categories Rf d (Ex ) \u2192 Rf d (E) define a natural transformation \u03b7 from the functor F : S(B) \u2192\nWCat, F (x) = Rf d (Ex ) to the constant functor over S(B) with the value Rf d (E).

Non-parametrized additivity theorem\nThe goal of this section is to prove the following\n3.1. Theorem (Additivity for the topological Euler characteristic). Let M be a closed\ntopological manifold which admits a splitting along a compact codimension one submanifold\nM0 :\nM = M1 \u222aM0 M2\n%\nThere exists a preferred path \u03c9 in A (M ) from \u03c7t (M ) to k1\u2217 \u03c7t M1 + k2\u2217 \u03c7t M2 \u2212 k0\u2217 \u03c7t M0 ,\nwhere ki : Mi ,\u2192 M is the inclusion map (i = 0, 1, 2).\nApplying the assembly map \u03b1 : A% (M ) \u2192 A(M ) to the path \u03c9 we obtain\n3.2.

If M is a manifold as in Theorem 3.1, then there exists a path in A(M )\njoining \u03c7h (M ) with k1\u2217 \u03c7h M1 + k2\u2217 \u03c7h M2 \u2212 k0\u2217 \u03c7h M0 .\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n13\n\nM0\nM2\n\nM1\n\nThus we recover the additivity theorem for the homotopy Euler characteristic which was\nproved in [2] by the second author.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Consider a manifold\nM = M1 \u222aM0 \u00d7{\u22121} M0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u222aM0 \u00d7{1} M2\n\nM1\n\nM0 \u2715 [-1, 1]\n\nM2\n\nFor i = 1, 2 let k\u0304i : Mi ,\u2192 M denote the inclusion map. We have a map f : M \u2192 M which\nrestricts to the inclusions k1 , k2 on M1 , M2 respectively, and which sends M0 \u00d7[\u22121, 1] \u2286 M\nto M0 \u2286 M via the projection map onto the first factor.\nWe will construct the path \u03c9 as a concatenation of three paths in A% (M ):\n1) a path \u03c91 from \u03c7t (M ) to f\u2217 \u03c7t (M ),\n2) a path \u03c92 from f\u2217 \u03c7t (M ) to f\u2217 (k\u03041\u2217 \u03c7t (M1 ) + k\u03042\u2217 \u03c7t (M1 ) + C) for some C \u2208 A% (M ),\n3) a path \u03c93 from f\u2217 k\u03041\u2217 \u03c7t (M1 )+f\u2217 k\u03042\u2217 \u03c7t (M1 )+f\u2217 C to k1\u2217 \u03c7h M1 +k2\u2217 \u03c7h M2 \u2212k0\u2217 \u03c7h M0 .\nConstruction of \u03c91 . Since f is a cell-like map, the path \u03c91 exists by lax naturality of \u03c7t\n(2.10).\nConstruction of \u03c92 . We will construct a point C \u2208 A% (M ) and a path \u03c3 in A% (M ) joining\n\u03c7t (M ) with (k\u03041\u2217 \u03c7t (M1 ) + k\u03042\u2217 \u03c7t (M1 ) \u2212 C. Then we will have \u03c92 = f\u2217 (\u03c3).\nFirst we define the point C as follows. Let C 0 \u2208 Rf d (M ) be the retractive space over M\ngiven by\nC 0 := M \u222aM0 \u00d7{\u22121,1} M0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]\nand let C 00 \u2208 V(M ) be given by the retractive space over M \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\nC 00 := M \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u222aM0 \u00d7{\u22121,1} M0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]\nwhere the embedding M0 \u00d7 {\u22121, 1} ,\u2192 M \u00d7 [0, \u221e) is given by (x, \u00b11) 7\u2192 ((x, \u00b11), 0). One\ncan check that (in the notation of Remark 2.4) we have I(C 0 ) = J(C 00 ), so (C 0 , C 00 ) is an\nobject of R% (M ). Take C to be the point in A% (M ) represented by this object.\nNext, recall (2.5) that for any compact ENR X the Euler characteristic \u03c7t (X) is represented by the object X t = (X h , X v ) \u2208 R% (X) . Also, notice that in our case the object\n\n\f14\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W. DORABIALA\n\nk\u0304i\u2217 Mih \u2208 Rf d (M ) is the retractive space Mi t M over M .

As a consequence we only need to construct a path from\n\u03c7t (M ) to [M1 t M2 t M , M1 t M2 t M \u00d7 [0, \u221e)] + C. In order to accomplish this notice\nthat C 0 fits into a cofibration sequence in Rf d (M )\n(k\u03041 tk\u03042 )t1\n\nh\n\n(M1 t M2 ) t M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M = M t M \u2212\u2192 C 0\nwhile C 00 is the cofiber in the following cofibration sequence in V(M ):\n(k\u03041 tk\u03042 )t1\n\nv\n\n(M1 t M2 ) t M \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M = M t M \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u2212\u2192 C 00\nAs before these sequences yield a cofibration sequence in R% (M )\nt\n\nh\n\nv\n\n(M1 t M2 t M , M1 t M2 t M \u00d7 [0, \u221e)) \u2192 M = (M , M ) \u2192 (C 0 , C 00 )\nPassing from R% (M ) to A% (M ) we obtain the desired path.\nConstruction of \u03c93 . We will show that in A% (M ) we have paths \u03b4i (i = 1, 2) joining\nf\u2217 k\u0304i\u2217 \u03c7t Mi with ki\u2217 \u03c7t Mi , and a path \u03b40 from f\u2217 C (where C \u2208 A% (M ) is defined as above)\nto \u2212k0\u2217 \u03c7t M0 . Then we can take \u03c93 = \u03b41 + \u03b42 + \u03b40 .\nFor i = 1, 2 we have f \u25e6 k\u0304i = ki , so f\u2217 k\u0304i\u2217 \u03c7t Mi = ki\u2217 \u03c7t Mi , and we can choose \u03b41 , \u03b42 to be\nthe constant paths.\nThe construction of the path \u03b40 resembles the construction of \u03c92 above. We have f\u2217 C =\n([f\u2217 C 0 ], [f\u2217 C 00 ]).

Flat bundles\nThe argument which led us to the proof of Theorem 3.1 can be generalized to give a\nproof of Theorem 1.3 for a certain class of fiber bundles.

As a consequence\n%\nit is enough to construct a path \u03c9 in holim Gop A (M ) joining the point [M t , F (g)t ] with\nk1\u2217 [M1t , F (g)t ] + k2\u2217 [M2t , F (g)t ] \u2212 k0\u2217 [M0t , F (g)t ].\nThe construction of this path follows the same steps as the proof of Theorem 3.1. As\nin that proof we construct a manifold M = M1 \u222aM0 \u00d7{\u22121} M0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u222aM0 \u00d7{1} M2 . Any\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n17\n\nhomeomorphism of M extends to a homeomorphism of M (which is a product map on\nM0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]), thus the group G acts on M , and we have a functor F\u0304 : G \u2192 R% (M ) such\nthat F\u0304 (\u2217) = R% (M ). The map f : M \u2192 M contracting M0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u2282 M to M0 \u2282 M is\nG-equivariant, so it defines a natural transformation f\u2217 : F\u0304 \u2192 F which in turn induces a\nmap of homotopy limits\nf\u2217 : holim\nA% (M ) \u2192 holim\nA% (M )\nop\nop\nG\n\nG\n\nSimilarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 we can now build the path \u03c9 as a concatenation\nof three paths. The first path in 3.1, (joining f\u2217 \u03c7t (M ) with \u03c7t (M )) was obtained using\nlax naturality of \u03c7t . In our present context we can construct a path in holim Gop A% (M )\nt\njoining f\u2217 [M , F\u0304 (g)t ] with [M t , F (g)t ] by applying Lemma 4.2 to the natural transformation\nf\u2217 : F\u0304 \u2192 F . The other two paths in the proof of Theorem 3.1 were constructed using certain\ncofibration sequences in R% (M ) and R% (M ). One can start with the same cofibration\nsequences and then for each retractive space appearing in them choose assignments {g \u2192\ng ! }g\u2208G in such way that the conditions of Lemma 4.3 are satisfied. As a consequence one\n\u0003\nobtains the desired paths in holim Gop A% (M ) and holim Gop A% (M ).\n5. Universal bundles\nIn the last section we verified that Theorem 1.3 holds for some bundles whose structure\ngroup is discrete. Our strategy of proving Theorem 1.3 in its whole generality is as follows.\nIn this section we show that the bundles which admit the required splitting into subbundles\nare induced by some universal bundle pU . Moreover, additivity of the topological Euler\ncharacteristic for an arbitrary bundle follows from its additivity for this universal bundle.\nThus, we only need to show that \u03c7t is additive for the bundle pU . We prove this special\ncase, using the results of the last section, in \u00a76.\nLet M be a closed topological manifold which admits a splitting along a codimension\none submanifold M0 :\nM ' M1 \u222aM0 M2\nLet T OP (M ) be the simplicial group of homeomorphisms of M and let T denote the\nsubgroup of T OP (M ) consisting of homeomorphisms which preserve the splitting.

Moreover, p is the universal\np\nbundle for bundles E \u2192 B with fiber M which admit such a splitting. Thus, if p splits\ninto subbundles pi with fibers Mi for i = 0, 1, 2 then we have a map c : B \u2192 BT which fits\ninto pullback diagrams:\n\n\f18\n\n(1)\n\nB. BADZIOCH AND W.

Meanwhile we will show that, as indicated at\nthe beginning of this section, Theorem 1.3 can be obtained from this special case. We will\nneed the following lemmas which follow directly from the constructions of A% (p), \u03c7t (p),\nand from Lemma 4.2.\n5.2. Lemma.

Let p : E \u2192 B be a fiber bundle as in the statement of Theorem\n1.3, and let c, ci , c\u0304, c\u0304i denote the maps as in the pullback squares (1) above. Applying the\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n19\n\nmap c\u0304\u2217 to the path \u03c3pU from Proposition 5.1 we obtain a path c\u0304\u2217 \u03c3pU in A% (p) joining\n\u2217\nt U\n\u2217\nt U\nc\u0304\u2217 \u03c7t (pU ) with c\u0304\u2217 \u03b91\u2217 \u03c7t (pU\n1 ) + c\u0304 \u03b92\u2217 \u03c7 (p2 ) \u2212 c\u0304 \u03b90\u2217 \u03c7 (p0 ).

Therefore we can concatenate \u03b7, c\u0304 \u03c3pU and \u03b7 0 and\nobtain a path in A% (p) which joins \u03c7t (p) with j1\u2217 \u03c7t (p1 ) + j2\u2217 \u03c7t (p2 ) \u2212 j0\u2217 \u03c7t (p0 ).\n\u0003\n6. From topological to discrete structure group\nAs the previous section demonstrated, checking additivity for the parametrized topological Euler characteristic reduces to showing that it holds for the universal bundle\npU : ET \u00d7T M \u2192 BT .

Let pi : Ei \u2192 B be the sub-bundles in the decomposition of p, and\nlet ji : Ei \u2192 E be the inclusion maps. Using the assumption that we have an additivity\npath for p0 and Lemma 5.2 we obtain a path in A(p0 ) joining f \u0304\u2217 \u03c7t (p) with f \u0304\u2217 (j1\u2217 \u03c7t (p1 ) +\nj2\u2217 \u03c7t (p2 ) \u2212 j0\u2217 \u03c7t (p0 )) Thus it suffices to prove that the map f \u0304\u2217 : A% (p) \u2192 A% (p0 ) is a weak\nequivalence.

In order to construct a suitable path \u03c9ph we will\nuse Abiv (p) \u2013 the bivariant A-theory of the bundle p [24]. The space Abiv (p) is the K-theory\nspace of the Waldhausen category Rf d (p) which is a full subcategory of the category of\nretractive spaces over E.

The Waldhausen category structure on Rf d (p) is defined by taking\na morphism to be a weak equivalence or a cofibrations if its underlying map of spaces is a\nhomotopy equivalence or respectively a cofibration.\nThe retractive space E t E \u001d E is an object of Rf d (p), and so it defines a point\nbiv\n\u03c7 (p) \u2208 Abiv (p). Let ji\u2217 : Abiv (pi ) \u2192 Abiv (p), i = 0, 1, 2, be the maps induced by inclusions\nof subbundles. Using the same constructions as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 with E, Ei\ntaken in place of M , Mi we can construct a path \u03c9pbiv in Abiv (p) joining \u03c7biv (p) with\nj\u22171 \u03c7biv (p1 ) + j2\u2217 \u03c7biv (p2 ) \u2212 j0\u2217 \u03c7biv (p0 ).\nFor every simplex x \u2208 S(B) we have an exact functor Rf d (p) \u2192 Rf d (Ex ) which yields a\nmap of infinite loop spaces Abiv (p) \u2192 A(Ex ). These maps can be combined to give a map\n\nholim Abiv (p) \u2192 holim A(Ex ) = A(p)\nx\n\nx\n\nwhere the first homotopy limit is taken over the constant functor with the value Abiv (p).\nComposing this map with the Bousfield-Kan map Abiv (p) ' limx Abiv (p) \u2192 holim x Abiv (p)\nwe obtain\n\u03b1\u2217 : Abiv (p) \u2192 A(p)\n(this is the generalized coassembly map of [24]). The image of \u03c7biv (p) under the map \u03b1\u2217\ndoes not coincide with \u03c7h (p), but there is a canonical path in holim x A(Ex ) which joins\nthese two points. As a consequence the path \u03b1\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c9pbiv defines an additivity path \u03c9ph for the\nhomotopy Euler characteristic.\nIn order to see that we have the required homotopy H one needs to retrace our construction of the additivity path for the topological Euler characteristic. First, one considers\nbundles with a discrete structure group where the homotopy H can described using constructions on the level of Waldhausen categories. For more general bundles one uses the\nfact that the additivity path \u03c9pt was obtained from the above special case by means of\npullbacks. This is enough to verify that the homotopy H will still exist.\nConstruction of the path \u03c9\u03c1h . Notice that the path \u03c9\u03c1h is an additivity path for the homotopy\nReidemeister torsion of the bundle p. The existence of such path was proved in [2]. In our\nept , thus it is not enough to\npresent setting we need the path \u03c9\u03c1h which is compatible with \u03c9\nquote that result. The path \u03c9\u03c1h can be obtained however by mimicking the constructions\nof [2]. Briefly, one starts by constructing Aac (p) - the acyclic bivariant A-theory of the\nbundle p. The space Aac (p) is obtained from a Waldhausen category Rac (p) which is a full\nsubcategory of Rf d (p). The objects of Rac (p) are these retractive spaces X o\n\nr\ns\n\n/ E which\n\nsatisfy the condition that for every b \u2208 B the relative chain complex of the pair (Fp\u25e6r , Fr )\nwith local coefficients in \u03c1|Fr is acyclic (as before Fp\u25e6r and Fp denote here the homotopy\nfibers over b of the maps p \u25e6 r and p respectively). The inclusion of Waldhausen categories\nRac (p) ,\u2192 Rf d (p) induces a map Aac (p) \u2192 Abiv (p). Directly from the construction of the\npath \u03c9pbiv it follows that it admits a lift \u03c9 ac to Aac (p). The space Aac (p) in turn maps into\n\n\fADDITIVITY FOR TOPOLOGICAL TORSION\n\n23\n\nthe homotopy Whitehead space \u03a6h\u03c1 (p) in such way that we obtain a commutative diagram\nAac (p)\n\n/ \u03a6h (p)\n\u03c1\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ A(p)\n\nAbiv (p)\n\nWe can take \u03c9\u03c1h to be the image of \u03c9 ac under this map.\nReferences\n[1] J.
