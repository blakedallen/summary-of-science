Introduction\nThe high-energy limit of gauge theory scattering amplitudes and cross sections has been a\nsource of interest for theory and phenomenology for more than half a century, starting with studies\nperformed in the context of Regge theory, long before the construction of the Standard Model of\nparticle physics [1]. In the context of Perturbative QCD, and using contemporary language, the\nproblem may be formulated as follows. Consider the key example of a four-point scattering amplitude, characterized by the Mandelstam invariants s, t and u, and by particle masses mi , satisfying\n4\n\ns + t + u = \u2211 m2i .\n\n(1.1)\n\ni=1\n\nThe high-energy limit is the limit in which the squared center-of-mass energy s is much larger\nthan other kinematic invariants, compatibly with the constraint in eq. (1.1). In the following, we\nconcentrate exclusively on massless scattering, m2i = 0, and one is then led to consider (in the\ncenter-of-mass frame) either forward scattering (s \u226b \u2212t, u \u223c \u2212s), or backward scattering (s \u226b \u2212u,\nt \u223c \u2212s). As expected in general for renormalizable field theories, in the presence of two disparate\nscales, say s and |t|, amplitudes are dominated order by order by logarithmic contributions, which\neventually spoil the (asymptotic) convergence of perturbation theory and need to be resummed.\nRegge theory suggests, under suitable assumptions, that this resummation can be achieved by replacing the t-channel propagator of the particle responsible for the leading power contribution to\nthe high-energy limit at Born level with its 'Reggeized' counterpart, according to\n1\n1\n\u2212\u2192\nt\nt\n\n\u0012\n\ns\n\u2212t\n\n\u0013\u03b1 (t)\n\n,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 (t) is the Regge trajectory for the chosen t-channel exchange. In Perturbative QCD, the\nRegge ansatz, eq. (1.2), can be studied explicitly, and 'Reggeization' can be proved, at least for\nselected amplitudes and to a given logarithmic accuracy [2, 3, 4]. Consider for example gluongluon scattering. To leading logarithmic (LL) accuracy [2], and to next-to-leading logarithmic\n(NLL) accuracy for the real part only [4], one can show that the scattering amplitude obeys a\nRegge factorization of the form\nMagg\u2192gg\n(s,t)\n1 a2 a3 a4\n\n=\n\n2 g2s\n\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0012 \u0013\u03b1 (t) \u0014\n\u0015\ns\ns\nb\n(T )a1 a3 C\u03bb1 \u03bb3 (k1 , k3 )\n(Tb )a2 a4 C\u03bb2 \u03bb4 (k2 , k4 ) ,\nt\n\u2212t\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere we take s = (k1 +k2 )2 and t = (k1 \u2212k3 )2 , T a are color generators in the adjoint representation,\ngs is the strong coupling, and the functions C\u03bbi \u03bb j (ki , k j ) are universal 'impact factors' associated\nwith gluons carrying momenta ki and helicities \u03bbi . Eq. (1.3) represents a universal factorization\nsince impact factors depend only on the identity of the energetic partons interacting via t-channel\nexchange, while the s dependence is confined to the Reggeized propagator, which in turn depends\nonly on the identity of the particle being exchanged in the t channel. Once this factorization is\nestablished, one may compute the various factors, and in particular the Regge trajectory \u03b1 (t),\nusing perturbation theory. A crucial fact is that the Regge trajectory is IR divergent order by order,\nsince it requires integrations over virtual corrections which involve soft gluon exchanges. Using\n2\n\n\fThe infrared structure of gauge amplitudes in the high-energy limit\n\nLorenzo Magnea\n\ndimensional continuation (to d \u2261 4 \u2212 2\u03b5 > 4) to regulate the infrared, it is practical to expand the\nRegge trajectory in powers of the d-dimensional running coupling [5], defined by the RG equation\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b12\n\u2202 \u03b1s\n= \u03b2 (\u03b5 , \u03b1s ) = \u2212 2\u03b5\u03b1s \u2212 s\n\u2202\u03bc\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2211 bn\n\nn=0\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011n\ns\n\n\u03c0\n\n,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u03b5 < 0 and b0 = (11CA \u2212 2n f )/3.

Notably, considerable progress was achieved in the last few years,\nwhich in particular led to an all-order ansatz [12, 13] for the anomalous dimension governing the\nexponentiation of IR and collinear poles in generic multi-particle massless scattering amplitudes.\nIn the following, we will first describe this ansatz (the 'dipole formula'), briefly discussing its properties and limitations, and then we will show how it can be used to improve our understanding of\nthe high-energy limit [14]. We will show that, at leading power in |t|/s and to arbitrary logarithmic accuracy, IR divergences are generated by a soft operator with a simple color and kinematic\nstructure, and we will use this result to prove Reggeization of IR divergent contributions to the\namplitude, at LL level, for the scattering of particles belonging to generic color representations.\nOur soft operator, however, is accurate to all logarithmic orders, so we can go beyond LL: we find\nthat standard Regge factorization breaks down at NNLL, and we give a general expression for the\nleading Reggeization-breaking operator. We then show how our method applies to multi-particle\nscattering in Multi-Regge kinematics, and we point out how the Regge limit constrains potential\ncorrections to the dipole ansatz.\n3\n\n\fThe infrared structure of gauge amplitudes in the high-energy limit\n\nLorenzo Magnea\n\n2. Dipoles\nOur understanding of IR and collinear divergences in gauge theory amplitudes rests on a powerful factorization theorem, which is the final result of many years of theoretical work [15]. In order\nto state the theorem, let us first note that a scattering amplitude in a non-abelian gauge theory is a\nvector in the space of the available color configurations, which is a subspace of the tensor product\nof the color representations of the n particles participating in the scattering process. Choosing a\nbasis of color tensors cJ in this space we may write\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\npi\npi\n2\n2\nMa1 ...aL\n, \u03b1s (\u03bc ), \u03b5 = \u2211 MJ\n, \u03b1s (\u03bc ), \u03b5 (cJ )a1 ...aL ,\n(2.1)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nJ\nIn the following we will consider massless fixed-angle scattering amplitudes, so that p2i = 0, and\nall invariants pi * p j \u226b \u039bQCD are taken to be of the same parametric size.

The color structure is expressed in a basis-independent way by\nthe color generators Ti , which act on hard parton i as gluon insertion operators, and \u03b3Ji are color\nsinglet anomalous dimensions for the jets. The crucial feature of eq. (2.9) is that it involves only\npairwise correlations between hard partons, an extremely drastic simplification with respect to the\nexpected level of complexity. A side effect of this simplification is the fact that the matrix structure\nof \u0393dip is fixed at one loop, and radiative corrections enter only through the anomalous dimensions\n\u03b3bK and \u03b3Ji : as a consequence, the path ordering in eq. (2.8) becomes immaterial. The dipole formula reproduces all known results for IR divergences of massless gauge theory amplitudes, and\nin principle it could be the definitive solution of the problem. We know however that eq. (2.9)\nmay receive, at sufficiently high orders, precisely two classes of corrections [12, 13]. First of all,\neq. (2.9) was derived assuming that the cusp anomalous dimensions in representation i remains\nproportional to the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue Ci to all orders in perturbation theory. This proportionality (\"Casimir scaling\") is established through explicit calculations only up to three loops,\nand in principle corrections proportional to higher-order Casimir operators might arise starting at\nfour loops (although arguments were given [13] that at four loops this does not actually happen).\nThe second class of possible corrections to eq. (2.9) arises because the conformal invariance of\nlight-like Wilson lines cannot constrain the dependence of \u0393 on conformally invariant cross-ratios\n5\n\n\fThe infrared structure of gauge amplitudes in the high-energy limit\n\nLorenzo Magnea\n\nof momenta such as \u03c1i jkl \u2261 (pi * p j pk * pl )/(pi * pk p j * pl ).

It has been shown to be tightly constrained not only by factorization,\nbut also by collinear limits, Bose symmetry and transcendentality requirements. A few examples\nof viable functions at three loops have however been constructed [17], and the general structure\nof possible corrections at four loops has been studied [18]. As we will see shortly, the highenergy limit provides further nontrivial constraints, which come tantalizingly close to showing that\n\u2206 should vanish, at least at three loops.\n\n3. High-energy\nSince the dipole formula is an ansatz applicable to all orders and for any number of hard\nparticles, it is natural to study its high-energy limit. Note that, strictly speaking, the fixed-angle\nassumption under which the dipole formula was derived breaks down as |t|/s \u2192 0. The ensuing\ncorrections however must take the form of logarithms of s/(\u2212t), with coefficients that remain finite\nas \u03b5 \u2192 0, since the high-energy limit cannot generate new divergent contributions. In order to write\nthe result in a compact and appealing form, it is useful to introduce color operators associated with\neach Mandelstam channel [19]. Explicitly\nTs = T1 + T2 = \u2212 (T3 + T4 ) ,\n\nTt = T1 + T3 = \u2212 (T2 + T4 )\n\n(3.1)\n\nand similarly for Tu . In eq. (3.1), we enforced color conservation, expressed in this context by\n\u2211i Ti = 0. For scattering between particles in generic color representations, the color operators in\neq.

[10] derived an expression analogous\nto eq. (3.5), and used it to compute the gluon Regge trajectory at NLL. One readily sees, in fact,\nthat the simple dependence of eq. (3.4) on the high-energy logarithm ln(s/(\u2212t)) has immediate\nconsequences on Reggeization, at least for divergent contributions to the amplitude. At LL level,\none can obviously discard the imaginary part of the exponent of eq. (3.4), and the matrix element\nin eq.

If this is the case the color operator Tt2 can be\nreplaced by its Casimir eigenvalue Ct , and the color state exchanged in the t channel is found to\nReggeize, with a Regge trajectory given by the function Ct K(\u03b1s , \u03b5 ). For example, for gluon-gluon\nscattering one finds\nTt2 H gg\u2192gg = CA Ht gg\u2192gg + O(|t|/s) ,\n(3.7)\nwhich implies\n\n2\n\u0013\ns CA K(\u03b1s (\u03bc ),\u03b5 )\nZ1 Ht gg\u2192gg .\n(3.8)\n\u2212t\nComputing the integral in eq. (3.5), one easily recovers the divergent terms in eq. (1.7). It is easy\nto see, however, that the same reasoning applies in full generality to different t-channel exchanges.\nSince our master formula, eq. (3.4), is valid to all logarithmic orders for divergent contributions, it is straightforward to go beyond LL accuracy. One may start by applying the BakerCampbell-Hausdorff formula to write the operator Ze as a product of exponentials of decreasing\nlogarithmic weight, as\n\u0012 \u0013h\n\u001a\ni\u001b\n\u0010s\n\u0011 \u0012 s \u0013K Tt2\n\b\ns\n\u03c0 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ne\n(3.9)\nTt , Ts\nexp i \u03c0 K Ts exp \u2212 i K ln\nZ , \u03b1s (\u03bc ), \u03b5 =\nt\n\u2212t\n2\n\u2212t\n\u001a 3\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013h\n\u0012 \u0013h\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0002 2 2 \u0003i\n\u0002 2 2 \u0003i\n\b\n\u0001\nK\ns\ns\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u00d7 exp\nTs , Tt , Ts + i\u03c0 ln\nTt , Tt , Ts\n\u22122\u03c0 ln\nexp O K 4 ,\n6\n\u2212t\n\u2212t\n\nM gg\u2192gg =\n\n\u0012\n\nwhere K = K(\u03b1s , \u03b5 ). From eq. (3.9), it is apparent that color exchanges that are not diagonal in\nthe t-channel basis become relevant at NLL accuracy for the imaginary part of the amplitude (as\nexemplified by the presence of the color operator T2s in the second factor on the r.h.s. of eq. (3.9)),\nand for the real part of the amplitude at NNLL accuracy. This implies a breakdown of Regge\nfactorization, as given in eq. (1.3). A general form of the leading Reggeization-breaking operator\nat NNLL for the real part of the amplitude is easily read off from eq. (3.9) and is given by\n\u0012 \u0013h\n\u0011\n\u0010s\n\u0002\n\u0003i\ns\n\u03c02 3\n(3.10)\nT2s , Tt2 , T2s ,\nE , \u03b1s , \u03b5 \u2261 \u2212 K (\u03b1s , \u03b5 ) ln\nt\n3\n\u2212t\n7\n\n\fThe infrared structure of gauge amplitudes in the high-energy limit\n\nLorenzo Magnea\n\n\u0001\nwhere we note that the expansion of K 3 (\u03b1s , \u03b5 ) starts out at O \u03b1s3 /\u03b5 3 .\nThe remarkable simplicity of eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) suggests that IR divergences of multi-particle\namplitudes might similarly simplify in a suitably defined high-energy limit. The relevant limit is\nwell-known [20], and is characterized by strongly ordered rapidities yi of the emitted particles,\nwhile transverse momenta ki\u22a5 are of the same parametric size. This configuration is called 'MultiRegge' kinematical regime, characterized by\n|ki\u22a5 | \u2243 |k\u22a5j | \u2200i, j .\n\ny3 \u226b y4 \u226b . . . \u226b yL\n\n(3.11)\n\nIn this limit, the relevant Mandelstam invariants can be written as\n\u2212 s \u2261 \u2212 s12 \u2243 |k3\u22a5 | |kL\u22a5 | e\u2212i\u03c0 ey3 \u2212yL ,\n\u2212 si j \u2243 |ki\u22a5 | |k\u22a5j | eyi \u2212y j e\u2212i\u03c0\n\n\u2212 s1i \u2243 |k3\u22a5 | |ki\u22a5 | ey3 \u2212yi ,\n\n(3 \u2264 i < j \u2264 L) ,\n\n\u2212 s2i \u2243 |kL\u22a5 | |ki\u22a5 | eyi \u2212yL ,\n(3.12)\n\nso that logarithms of ratios of kinematical invariants are dominated by rapidity differences.

Given eq. (3.14), it\nis clear that the patterns of Reggeization, and Reggeization breaking, which have been discussed in\nthe case of the four-point amplitude generalize to the Multi-Regge kinematics in a straightforward\nmanner. Notice that it is not necessary that the tree-level hard amplitude be dominated by the\nexchange of a single color state across all the tk subchannels: if multiple representations contribute\nat leading power in the high-energy limit, they will separately Reggeize (at LL), with the expected\nRegge trajectories, as a consequence of eq. (3.14).\n\n4. Quadrupoles?\nSo far we have discussed the implications of the dipole formula on the high-energy limit of\nscattering amplitudes. It is important to note that known results concerning the high-energy limit\ncan, in turn, be used to constrain possible corrections to the dipole formula. As was outlined in\n8\n\n\fThe infrared structure of gauge amplitudes in the high-energy limit\n\nLorenzo Magnea\n\nSec. 2, we already know that corrections to the dipole formula can only arise from violations of\nCasimir scaling for the cusp anomalous dimension, or in the form of functions of the conformal\ncross ratios \u03c1i jkl , denoted by \u2206 in eq. (2.10). In order to explore the existence of possible constraints\non these functions arising from the high-energy limit, let us focus on four-point amplitudes. In this\ncase three different cross ratios can be constructed: \u03c11234 , \u03c11342 , \u03c11423 , subject to the constraint\n\u03c11234 \u03c11324 \u03c11423 = 1. They are given by\n\n\u03c11234 =\n\n\u0012\n\ns\n\u2212t\n\n\u00132\n\n\u22122i\u03c0\n\ne\n\n,\n\n\u03c11342 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212t\ns+t\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n\u03c11423 =\n\n\u0012\n\ns+t\ns\n\n\u00132\n\ne2i\u03c0 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere care was taken to retain the correct phases. In the high-energy limit, the logarithms of the\ncross ratios, Li jkl \u2261 log \u03c1i jkl can be expressed, up to corrections suppressed by powers of |t|/s \u2192 0,\nin terms of the high-energy logarithm L \u2261 log(s/(\u2212t)) as\nL1234 = 2(L \u2212 i\u03c0 ) ,\n\nL1342 = \u22122L ,\n\nL1423 = 2i\u03c0 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nOne may now examine the existing examples of functions \u2206 which satisfy all previously examined\nconstraints [17]. The simplest example, a symmetric polynomial in the logarithms Li jkl , is given by\n\u2206\n\n(212)\n\n(\u03c1i jkl , \u03b1s ) =\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00113\ns\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nf ade f cbe L21234 L1423 L21342 + L21423 L1342\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+ f cae f dbe L21423 L1234 L21342 + L21234 L1342\n\u0011\u0015\n\u0010\n2\n2\nbae cde 2\n+ f f L1342 L1423 L1234 + L1423 L1234 .\n\nTa1 Tb2 Tc3 Td4\n\n(4.3)\n\nIn the high-energy limit (and using Jacobi identities for the structure constants f abc ) one finds\n\u2206(212) (\u03c1i jkl , \u03b1s ) =\n\n\u0011\nh\u0010\nTa1 Tb2 Tc3 Td4 32 i \u03c0 \u2212 L4 \u2212 i\u03c0 L3 \u2212 \u03c0 2 L2 \u2212 i\u03c0 3 L f ade f cbe\n\u03c0\n\u0010\ni\n\u0011\n+ 2i\u03c0 L3 \u2212 3\u03c0 2 L2 \u2212 i\u03c0 3 L f cae f dbe + O (|t/s|) .\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00113\ns\n\n(4.4)\n\nSuch a function cannot contribute to the anomalous dimension matrix \u0393, since it would generate\nsuper-leading high-energy logarithms, \u03b1sp Lq , with q > p, starting at three loops. One may easily\nshow that all explicit examples constructed in Ref. [17] suffer from this problem: indeed, the problem appears to be rather generic, since the function \u2206 is constrained by collinear limits and Bose\nsymmetry to contain a minimum number of factors behaving logarithmically at large s. In order\nto put together a viable example of a three-loop correction to the dipole formula, one would have\nto construct a linear combination of functions such as eq. (4.3), each with the 'wrong' high-energy\nbehavior, arranging for the cancellation of the unwanted logarithms. Since gluon Reggeization\nis proven in general to NLL accuracy, in eq. (4.4) one would need to cancel not only the superleading L4 contribution, but the leading (L3 ) and next-to-leading (L2 ) terms as well, since those\nare correctly predicted by the dipole formula, and would have a color structure incompatible with\ngluon Reggeization. So far, no explicit example of such a function has been constructed.\n9\n\n\fThe infrared structure of gauge amplitudes in the high-energy limit\n\nLorenzo Magnea\n\n5. Perspective\nWe have summarized some recent developments concerning the IR structure of scattering amplitudes in massless gauge theories, with applications to the widely studied high-energy regime.\nThe dipole formula, if correct, would be the first case in which the structure of a multi-particle\nnon-abelian anomalous dimension is understood exactly to all orders in perturbation theory: note\nthat it applies to any massless gauge theory and it is exact in the 1/Nc expansion. In the highenergy limit, the dipole formula implies Reggeization of IR-singular contributions to the amplitude\nat LL accuracy, and at NLL accuracy for the real part of the amplitude. Beyond NLL, it predicts\nthe existence of specific Reggeization-breaking contributions, which can be explicitly computed\nin practical cases once the relevant hard sub-amplitudes are known. In turn, known results on the\nhigh-energy limit of scattering amplitudes constrain possible corrections to the dipole formula in a\nsignificant way, ruling out individually all viable examples which had been constructed so far, and\nit is conceivable that a definitive answer on the IR structure of multiparticle massless gauge theory\namplitudes will become available in a not-too-far future.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.I.O.R.J.
