We argue that there is a particular density\nof dopants (holes) where the entanglement contained in the lattice attains its maximal value for the\nnearest-neighbour RVB liquid state.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nIn quantum many-body physics, resonating-valencebond (RVB) states have received a lot of attention due\nto their importance in the description of different phenomena. They are used to describe the resonance of covalent bonds in organic molecules, behavior of Mott insulators without long-range antiferromagnetic order [1],\nsuperconductivity in organic solids [2], and the recently\ndiscovered insulator-superconductor transition in borondoped diamond [3]. There are many other applications\nof RVB states (see e.g. [4]). Moreover, RVB states have\nbeen suggested as a basis for fault-tolerant topological\nquantum computation [5].\nIt was postulated by Anderson in Ref. [1] that the\nshort range nearest-neighbour RVB state (also called\nRVB liquid) might be responsible for the phenomenon of\nhigh temperature superconductivity. The cuprate superconductors are recognized as doped Mott insulators as in\nthe case of Strontium doped Lanthanum cuprate LSCO.\nThe copper oxide planes are described by the one-band\nHubbard model with a strong, on-site repulsion U. The\nRVB state on a square lattice for the Hubbard Hamiltonian with strong Coloumb repulsion was proposed by\nAnderson to be the Mott insulator phase of the system,\ni.e., the pure Lanthanum cuprate is in an RVB state. By\nintroducing dopants one removes some electrons from the\nlattice creating \"holes\", i.e., unoccupied sites on the lattice. As pointed out by Anderson, it would take a finite\nconcentration of dopants to metallize the material and\nmake it a superconductor as initially the dopants will be\nscreened by the bound quasiparticles. The holes start\nto hop from one site to another and their motion is uninhibited leading to their delocalization over the whole\nlattice, which can be interpreted as a persistent current.\nThe movement of the holes is resistant to thermal noise\nand depends on the density \u03bc of dopants (holes) reaching its maximum somewhere between 10% to 15% (the\nso-called 1/8 anomaly) of holes on the lattice. It is notable that there does not seem to be a clear consensus on\nthe origin of this anomaly.\n\nIndeed, the ground state of the 2D Hubbard model\nwith doping is still unknown. Numerical simulations indicate that the RVB scenario is the right one for coupled plaquettes and ladders [6], and recently experiments\nhave been proposed to test the RVB scenario in fermionic\natoms in 2D optical lattices [7]. These experiments propose methods to increase the inter-ladder coupling to\ncheck if the RVB state on ladders is adiabatically connected to the Hubbard model ground state on the square\nlattice, which would provide an experimental test of the\nRVB theory. In this paper, we investigate the entanglement properties of the RVB states in small-sized laddders\nand plaquettes and speculate on the behavior in the thermodynamic limit.\nThe entanglement properties of RVB states without\ndopants on many dimensional lattices has been investigated in [8]. The main conclusion of the Ref. [8] is that\nsuch states can only have (if any) a very small amount\nof bipartite entanglement between any two sites on the\nlattice but they are always genuinely multi-partite entangled.\nIn view of this, it is interesting to see how multipartite\nentanglement of RVB states depends on the density of\nholes. In particular, we are interested if changes in the\namount of entanglement correspond to the experimental\nobservation of the maximal Tc superconductivity in the\nhole density window 0.1 < \u03bc < 0.15. Intuitively, one\nwould expect entanglement to be larger in this window as\nwell. This is because entanglement and supercurrent are\nboth related to the existence of correlations and therefore\ntheir peaks should be related i.e. a larger entanglement\nwould be more robust to increase in temperature.\nTo address these questions we first define the RVB\nstates on a 2L site lattice with 2n holes and an appropriate entanglement measure. Subsequently, we investigate\nanalytically lattices up to 24 sites with open boundary\nconditions. Based on the obtained results we conjecture\nthat in the thermodynamic limit of L \u2192 \u221e the amount\nof entanglement reaches its maximum for some critical\ndensity of holes \u03bccr , where 0 < \u03bccr < 1.\n\n\f2\nan equilibrium can be written then as\n\nFORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM\n\nLet us consider a two dimensional lattice with open\nboundary conditions consisting of 2L sites, which is a\nunion of two sub-lattices A and B in such a way that\nany site belonging to the sub-lattice A(B) has all its\nnearest neighbours belonging to the sub-lattice B(A).\nWe define a dimer between sites a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B\nas a singlet state |\u03b4ab i = \u221a12 (|0ia |1ib \u2212 |1ia |0ib ). A\ndimer covering is defined as a tensor product of dimers\n|\u2206[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(aL bL )] i = \u2297L\nHere the set\nk=1 |\u03b4ak bk i.\nof pairs [(a1 b1 ), (a2 b2 ), . . . , (aL bL )] represents a particular way of joining neighbouring sites of the two sublattices with singlets. The number of such sets for the\ncase of square lattices with open\nconditions\n\u221a\n\u221a boundary\nQ L2 Q L2\n\u03c0j\n)+\nis, from [9], [10], given by j=1 k=1 (4 cos2 ( 2n+1\n2 \u03c0k\n4 cos ( 2n+1 )). For periodic boundary conditions in the\nL\nsquare lattice this number\nto be (exp ( 2G\n\u03c0 )) \u2248\nP\u221e is known\nL\nn\n2\n(1.791) , where G = n=0 (\u22121) /(2n + 1) is Catalan's\nconstant.\nThe RVB liquid is defined as\n1\n|\u2206i = \u221a\nR (a\n\nX\n\n|\u2206[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(aL bL )] i,\n\n(1)\n\n1 b1 )...(aL bL )\n\nwhere R is the normalization constant and the summation extends over all possible dimer coverings. R can\nbe in principle calculated using the techniques of the socalled 'random loop soup' [11]. In practice, the problem\nof counting is analytically intractable and even with the\nhelp of numerics one cannot compute R for large L.\nLet us now denote an equal superposition of dimer coverings of the lattice where two arbitrary sites ai and bj\nare unoccupied by |\u2206(ai bj ) i. Please note that we do not\nallow two sites belonging to the same sub-lattice to be\nunoccupied as this will preclude the possibility of covering the rest of the lattice with nearest-neighbour dimers.\nThis guarantees that the occupied part of the lattice is in\nthe RVB liquid state with the number of dimer coverings\ndepending on the positions of the holes.\nIn general, if there are 2n holes one can define\nin the same manner the state |\u2206[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )] i,\ni.e., the superposition of all possible coverings of\nthe part of the lattice excluding the empty sites\n(a1 b1 ), (a2 b2 ), . . . , (an bn ). Note that if n is too large it\nmay not be possible to cover the part of the lattice without holes by dimers. A simple example is when 2n = L.\nIn this situation if every second site is empty (chess board\nconfiguration), the remaining part of the lattice cannot\nbe covered by dimers. We will address this issue further\non.\nThe final steady state of the system, i.e., the state\nafter the system of the lattice and dopants has reached\n\nX\n\n|\u22062n i =\n\n(ai1 bj1 ),...(ain bjn )\n\nq\n\np(ai1 , bj1 , . . . ain , bjn )|\u2206[(ai1 bj1 ),...(ain bjn )] i, (2)\n\nwhere the probability distribution of the holes\np(ai1 , bj1 , . . . ain , bjn ) depends on their detailed dynamics.\nWe would like to be very clear about the meaning of\n|\u22062n i, namely that, it may not be an accurate description\nof the state of the lattice of a real doped superconductor.\nFirst of all, the RVB theory is one of many theories of\nthe discussed phenomenon [12]. Secondly, even within\nthe RVB theory itself it is not clear how the state with 2n\nholes looks like [13]. For instance, one cannot exclude the\npossibility that long-range dimers will appear in |\u22062n i.\nHowever, it seems reasonable to assume that for a small\namount of holes |\u22062n i is an acceptable choice.\nIt is not clear how to quantify multiparty entanglement in the |\u22062n i state. The problem arises from the\nfact that a commonly accepted definition of multiparty\nentanglement is that any bipartition of the considered\nmany particle quantum state must be entangled. However, in our case any bipartition of the lattice (equivalently the bipartition of the state |\u22062n i) leads to a state\nwith a variable number of particles on each site of the bipartition. According to super-selection rules one cannot\nobserve a superposition of states with different number\nof particles [14], which considerably complicates the task\nof quantifying entanglement in RVB states with holes.\nAs a measure of the amount of non-classical correlations in the lattice we take the geometric measure of entanglement [15], which is generalized to the multi-partite\ncase in a straight-forward manner [16]. For pure states,\nthe measure is given by the 21 -based logarithm of the\nsquared modulo of the overlap between the state, and\nthe separable state closest to it\nE(|\u03c8i) = \u2212 max | log2 |h\u03c8|\u03c8sep i|2 ,\n|\u03c8sep i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere |\u03c8sep i is a separable state. In the case of our lattice, however, we deal with the subtle matter of superselection rules, because the closest product state to the\nRVB state could involve forbidden local superpositions\nof a hole and an electron. For this reason, we use the\naverage geometric measure. The averaging is done over\nall possible locations of the holes.\nMore precisely, we define an average geometric measure\nof entanglement on the state |\u22062n i as\n\u0112(2n) =\n\nX\n(ai1 bj1 ),...(ain bjn )\n\np(ai1 , bj1 , . . . ain , bjn )E(|\u2206[(a1 b1 ),...,(an bn )] i),\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\nwhere\nE(|\u2206[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )] i) =\n\u22122 log2 max |h\u03c8sep |\u2206[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )] i|. (5)\n|\u03c8sep i\n\nThe maximum is taken over all fully separable states on\nthe part of the lattice without holes and the physical\nmeaning of \u0112(2n) is clear; it is the average amount of\nentanglement one gets after locating the position of the\nholes on the lattice.\n\nRVB state without holes: \u0112(0).\n\nFirst we consider the RVB state without holes. We\nalready know from the Ref. [8] that it contains negligible\ntwo-site entanglement but it is genuinely multi-party entangled. Here we calculate \u0112(0) that will serve us later\nas a basis for comparison with \u0112(2n). Additionally, the\nsame method of calculation will be used for n > 0.\nWe have\n\u0112(0) = \u22122 max log2 |h\u03c8sep |\u2206i| = \u22122 log2\n|\u03c8sep i\n\nC\n,\nR\n\n(6)\n\nFIG. 1: \u0112(2n) for Ladder lattices 3x2, 4x2, . . . , 10x2. Note\nthe appearance of the peak at 2 holes for lattices larger than\n6x2\n\n|\u2206[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )] i. Therefore, we have\n\u0112(2n) =\n\nX\n\np(a1 , b1 , . . . an , bn )\n\n(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )\n\nwhere C\u221ais the\n\u221a number of dimer coverings for |\u2206i, i.e.,\nQ L2 Q L2\n\u03c0j\n\u03c0k\nC = j=1 k=1 (4 cos2 ( 2n+1\n) + 4 cos2 ( 2n+1\n)) for open\n2G L\nboundary conditions and C = (exp ( \u03c0 )) for periodic\nboundary conditions in the square lattice. This result\ncan be argued as follows. The state |\u2206i always has\nan \"anti-ferromagnetic\" term of the form |0101 . . . 01i\nor |1010 . . . 10i with its coefficient equal to \u00b1 C\nR . Naturally every other term has smaller coefficient, because in\nthe superposition of all coverings only the antiferromagnetic terms add up. Thus, there is a fully separable state\n(0)\n|\u03c8sep i = |0101 . . . 01i for which the modulus of the scalar\nproduct with |\u2206i equals C\nR . However, the only fully separable state with equal number of zeros and ones is of\nthe form |x1 x2 . . . xn i with x1 + x2 + * * * + xn = L, which\n(0)\n(max)\nmeans that |\u03c8sep i = |\u03c8sep i.\n\n\u0012\nlog2\n\nC[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )]\nR[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )]\n\n\u0013\u22122\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThe main difficulty in the above formula is that it is an\nN P -complete problem to calculate C[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )]\nand R[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )] . This stems from the known\nresult in theoretical computer science [17] that counting dimer coverings of a planar lattice is a polynomialtime computable problem, whereas counting monomerdimer arrangements on the two-dimensional lattice is an\nN P -complete problem. In our language, the holes correspond to the monomers and the singlet pairs correspond to the dimers. Thus, finding C[(a1 b1 ),(a2 b2 ),...,(an bn )]\nis an N P -complete problem.

The results, shown in the Fig. [1] for ladders and Fig[2] for rectangular lattices, clearly show that\n\u0112(2n) reaches the maximum at a certain hole density as\nthe size of the lattice increases. Moreover, the maximum\noccurs at a low concentration of holes.\n\n\f\u0112(2n)\n\n4\n\nFIG. 3: Typical pathological case which is omitted from shortrange RVB calculations. These cases do not affect the behavior of entanglement as explained in the text.\n\n2n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFIG. 2: \u0112(2n) for Rectangular lattices 6x4, 5x4, 4x4, 4x3.\nNote the appearance of the peak at 4 holes in 5x4 and 6x4.\nThe position of the peak has shifted to the right (higher density) compared to that in Fig [1].\n\nWe now elucidate certain significant points in the calculations leading to the graphs in Figs [1] and [2]. As an\nillustrative example, let us consider the lattice of size 6x4\nwith four holes, at which point the peak occurs in this\nstructure. It is clear that the 4 holes can be in one of\nC212 \u00d7C212 positions, where Cnm denotes the binomial coefficient. Hence, one has to average over the entanglement\nfound in each of these cases to find \u0112(4) for this lattice.\nHowever, in this calculation we omit the pathological positions of the holes in which a single site is surrounded on\nall sides by holes as in Fig.[3], in which case the rest of\nthe lattice is unable to form a short-range RVB structure.\nLong-range dimers between sites belonging to the same\nsublattice would be needed to fill the lattice in such a situation and we omit the corrections accruing due to these.\nIn any case, neglecting these situations cannot substantially alter the behaviour of entanglement because they\n(ab/2) 2\n(ab/2)\u22121\noccur with the probability of 4(C2\n\u2212 1)/(C2\n)\nfor four holes in an a\u00d7b lattice. Note that the probability\nof occurrence of these situations is zero for two holes so\nthat the positive gradient at the beginning of the curve\nis maintained and the existence of the peak is assured.\nThus, we conclude that the peak in the graph is maintained even when these situations involving long-range\ndimers are taken into consideration.\nIt is seen from Fig[2] that the initial gradient of the\ncurve increases with the size of the lattice. If the trend\ncontinues for larger lattices, one might expect the peak\nto shift to the right and converge to a particular concentration in the thermodynamic limit.\n\nOur data strongly indicates that the average multiparty entanglement quantified by \u0112(2n) reaches a maximum for some critical density of holes in the thermodynamical limit. Although we are unable to predict the\nexact value of this critical density due to the hard computational nature of the problem, we conjecture that it\nis located in the region of low density of holes.\nA possible way to get some additional information\nabout the location of the maximum in the thermodynamic limit would be to translate the problem in graph\ntheoretic language in the following way [18]. It is apparent that each dimer covering of the RVB structure can be\nrepresented as a balanced bipartite graph with the sublattices A and B forming the two vertex sets, there being\nL edges in a 2L site lattice. In such a graph, there is no\npath between any two sites belonging to the same sublattice, and the matching number of the graph is equal\nto L. These conditions can be extended to the case of the\nlattice with holes as well.\nThe problem of finding C then translates to the equivalent problem of finding the number of graphs with adjacency matrices having the following property. Each\nadjacency matrix is a sparse matrix of size 2L by 2L, the\nmth row has a 1 at one of upto four possible positions,\nthese corresponding to the sites adjacent to site m in the\nlattice; and each row and each column has only one nonzero entry. The number of such matrices then equals the\nnumber of coverings. Algorithms for approximating C\nhave been devised as enumerating the number of perfect\nmatchings in such graphs in [19].\nThe problem of finding R can also be broken down into\nthe equivalent problem of finding the number of degenerate and non-degenerate loops in every distinct superposition of two coverings, as in [20]. To do this, we add all the\nadjacency matrices for that lattice, two at a time, keeping only the distinct results. The number of degenerate\nloops (dl) in each such superposition is then simply half\nthe number of twos in the resulting matrix. The number\nof nondegenerate loops (ndl) is equal to the total num-\n\n\f5\n1 (A)\n\n1 (C)\n\n1 (B)\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2 (A)\n\n2 (C)\n\n2 (B)\n\nFIG. 4: Graph theoretic formulation: 1(A),2(A)- Sample coverings 1 and 2 of 4 \u00d7 4 lattice with two holes; 1(B),2(B)Corresponding bipartite graphs; 1(C),2(C) Corresponding adjacency matrices to the two coverings\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(A) Superposition of Coverings 1 and 2\n(B) Graph\n(C) Adjacency Matrix of Resulting Graph;\nNumber of degenerate loops = 2 ;\nNumber of non-degenerate loops =1\n\nbipartite graph corresponding to the state is shown to\nits right in 1 (B). The graph has bipartition (A,B) with\nA = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) and B = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).\nSince, |A| = |B| = L, the graph is balanced. Edges of\nthe graph connect vertex set A to B such that an edge\nconnects a vertex to only one of its nearest neighbouring\nvertices on the lattice. Since there are L such edges, the\nsize of the maximum matching of the graph is equal to L.\nThe adjacency matrix for this graph is shown alongside\nin 1(C). To find R, we would need to superimpose the two\ncoverings on each other as shown in Fig [5]. The resulting graph and its adjacency matrix (the sum of the two\nadjacency matrices in Fig [4]) are shown alongside. The\nnumber of degenerate and non-degenerate loops can then\nbe calculated from the number of cycles in the graph.\nIt is hoped that with these methods and by experimental observations as suggested in [7] the entanglement vs\nhole density curve can be constructed in the thermodynamic limit. This might throw more light on the question\nof whether multipartite entanglement, defined in this average geometric sense could indicate the occurrence of\nthe quantum phase transition.\nWe would like to thank Aditi Sen, Ujjwal Sen, Jacob\nDunningham, Miklos Santa and G.
