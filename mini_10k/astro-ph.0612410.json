The range in\nC stems from different choices of the stellar mass estimator, from minimum to\nmaximum disk.

An elaborate paradigm for dark matter has subsequently developed: \u039bCDM.\nMore recent work emphasizes larger scale constraints (e.g., Tegmark et al. 2004; Spergel et\nal. 2006). An important question is whether this cosmic paradigm provides a satisfactory\ndescription of spiral galaxies.\n1\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742-2421\n\n2\n\nResearch School of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Mt.

This remains lacking. Indeed, there are a number of lingering problems\non small (galaxy) scales. These include the cusp-core problem (e.g., de Blok et al. 2001a),\nthe missing satellite problem (e.g., Moore et al. 1999a), the dynamical friction time scale\nproblem (Goerdt et al. 2006; Sanchez-Salcedo, Reyes-Iturbide, & Hernandez 2006), and a\nwhole suite of other incongruities and apparent contradictions that arise on the scale of\nindividual galaxies (McGaugh & de Blok 1998; Sellwood & Kosowsky 2001). In this paper,\nwe will concentrate on the amplitude of the rotation velocity that is observed for spiral\ngalaxy dark matter halos and that predicted by \u039bCDM.\nConsiderable attention has focused on the density profile inferred for the dark matter\nhalos of dwarf and low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies at small radii (Moore 1994; Flores &\nPrimack 1994; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2000; Swaters et al. 2000; de Blok et al. 2001a,b; Borriello & Salucci\n2001; Salucci 2001; Bolatto et al. 2002; Marchesini et al. 2002; Salucci et al. 2003; Swaters\net al. 2003a,b; de Blok et al. 2003; Donato et al. 2004; Simon et al. 2003, 2005; Gentile et al.\n2004, 2005; Spekkens, Giovanelli, & Haynes 2005; Kuzio de Naray et al. 2006; Zackrisson et\nal. 2006). There are good reasons for this: LSB galaxies are dark matter dominated down to\nsmall radii, making the inference of their dark matter properties much less sensitive to the\nstellar mass than in higher surface brightness spirals. In the most straightforward analyses,\nthe data appear to contradict a basic prediction of the \u039bCDM structure formation scenario,\nthat dark matter halos should have cusps at small radii (a density distribution \u03c1 \u223c r \u2212\u03b3 with\n\u03b3 \u2248 1: Dubinski 1994; Cole & Lacey 1996; Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997 (hereafter NFW);\nTormen, Bouchet, & White 1997; Moore et al. 1998, 1999b; Tissera & Dominguez-Tenreiro\n1998; Nusser & Sheth 1998; Syer & White 1998; Avila-Reese, Firmiani, & Hernandez 1998;\nSalvador-\u015aole, Solanes, & Manrique 1998; Jing 2000; Jing & Suto 2000; Kull 1999; Klypin\net al. 2001; Ricotti 2003; Power et al. 2003; Diemand et al. 2005). The data are apparently\nmore consistent with a nearly constant density core (\u03b3 \u2248 0). Many different solutions to this\nproblem have been proposed (e.g., El-Zant, Shlosman, & Hoffman 2001; Weinberg & Katz\n2002; Merritt et al. 2004; Ma & Boylan-Kolchin 2004; Mashchenko, Couchman, & Wadsley\n2006; Tonini, Lapi, & Salucci 2006).\nInteresting constraints also stem from the rotation curve data for high surface brightness\n(HSB) galaxies. It is frequently possible to obtain quite high quality data for these bright\nobjects, but the interpretation depends critically on the mass ascribed to baryons. The\nstellar disks in these objects can be massive (e.g., Debatista & Sellwood 2000; Salucci &\nBurkert 2000; Weiner, Sellwood, & Williams 2001; Zavala et al. 2003; Kassin, de Jong, &\nWeiner 2006) or even maximal (e.g., van Albada & Sancisi 1986; Kent 1987; Palunas &\nWilliams 2000; Battaglia et al. 2006). Such dynamically dominant disks leave little room\nfor halos with steep inner density profiles. For example, Binney & Evans (2001) find that\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ncuspy halos are inconsistent with a number of constraints for the Milky Way (cf. Klypin,\nZhao, & Somerville 2002). On the other hand, it can be argued that the lack of scale length\nresiduals in the Tully-Fisher relation implies that typically HSB disks are sub-maximal (e.g.,\nCourteau & Rix 1999; cf. Sellwood 1999). If dark matter is dynamically significant in the\ninner regions of HSB galaxies, then it may be quite possible for the halos of these galaxies\nto have a steep cusp. The critical issue is the stellar mass.\nConstraining the precise inner slope of the dark matter density profile of an individual\ngalaxy is observationally challenging. Even if the stellar mass can be properly treated, a\nvariety of systematic effects might affect the result (Swaters et al. 2003a; de Blok et al.\n2003; Simon et al. 2003, 2005; Spekkens et al. 2005). There are several distinct problems\nhere: observational uncertainties, non-circular motions that might cause misestimation of\nthe potential, and degeneracy between fitting parameters.\nObservational uncertainties of concern here are those that might lead us to underestimate the steepness of the rise of the rotation curve. This might result, for example, from\nbeam-smearing of 21 cm observations (e.g., van den Bosch et al. 2000) or mis-positioning of\nthe slit during optical observations (e.g., Swaters et al. 2003a). Such errors are not a great\nconcern when rotation curves are observed to be steeply rising, as is typically the case for\nHSB galaxies in this sample. When the observed rotation curve rises more gradually, there is\nmore potential for concern as to whether this behavior is truly intrinsic (de Blok, McGaugh,\n& van der Hulst 1997; de Blok & McGaugh 1997). This no longer appears to be a significant\nworry for LSB galaxies, as high resolution two dimensional velocity fields (Kuzio de Naray\net al. 2006) largely confirm pervious results (e.g., McGaugh, Rubin, & de Blok 2001; de Blok\n& Bosma 2002; see also Zackrisson et al. 2006).\nNon-circular motions can be significant at small radii, in the sense that they can represent a substantial fraction of the total gravitational potential. The contributions of circular\nand noncircular motions sum in quadrature. From this, it immediately follows that noncircular motions (Vr ) are only important when comparable to the rotational motion (V\u03c6 ).\nSimon et al. (2005) show some cases for which this is the case (Vr \u2248 V\u03c6 ), albeit at quite\nsmall radii. For the sample considered here, which all have two dimensional velocity fields,\nVr is typically small (a few to tens of km s\u22121 ) compared to V\u03c6 at the same radius (tens to\nhundreds of km s\u22121 ). We consider only intermediate and large radii where V\u03c62 \u226b Vr2 and the\ncontribution of non-circular motions to the potential is not significant. Galaxies that do not\nsatisfy this criterion are not in the sample.\nA more fundamental difficulty is the degeneracy between halo fitting parameters, even\nwhen the potential is perfectly well known. The degeneracy between stellar mass and the core\nradius of a pseudo-isothermal halo has long been known (e.g., Kent 1987). For NFW halos,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthere is substantial covariance between c and V200 even when the stellar mass is fixed (de\nBlok et al. 2001b). This degeneracy stems from the similarity of the inner shapes of NFW\nhalo velocity profiles over a range of (c,V200 ). More generally, degeneracy is unavoidable\nbecause of a surplus of parameters. Mass models require the specification of a minimum of\nthree parameters per galaxy (one for the disk and two for the halo) while empirically a single\nparameter suffices to describe the data (e.g., Brada & Milgrom 1999; McGaugh 2004).\nIn this paper, we adopt a model independent approach. We do not fit specific mass\nmodels to individual galaxies. The halo parameters derived from such models inevitably\nsuffer from parameter degeneracies. Rather, we simply ask what range of halo parameters\n(c, V200 ) are consistent with the halo velocities implied by observation. We determine the\nvelocity attributable to the dark matter for a broad range of stellar mass estimators.\nWe find that the data are consistent with a nearly universal dark matter halo profile.\nThere is some scatter about this relation, and we would not claim that there is in fact\na single halo profile appropriate to all galaxies, but the data are not wildly at odds with\nsuch a situation. The slope we find is consistent with previous determinations (e.g., Barnes,\nSellwood, & Kosowsky 2004). If halos have the NFW form, their concentrations and/or\nmasses (V200 ) are generally smaller than might nominally be expected in \u039bCDM. This is\nlargely consistent with various previous results (e.g., Debatista & Sellwood 2000; Weiner et\nal. 2001; Borriello & Salucci 2001; Zentner & Bullock 2002; Alam, Bullock, & Weinberg 2002;\nMcGaugh et al. 2003; Bell et al. 2003a; Gentile et al. 2004; Zackrison et al. 2006; Portinari &\nSommer-Larsen 2006) that suggest that real dark matter halos are less dense than predicted\nby \u039bCDM.\nThe data and stellar mass estimators are described in \u00a72. In \u00a73 we determine the halo\nvelocity Vh implied by the data for a range of stellar mass estimates. The predictions of\n\u039bCDM models and their relation to the data are described in \u00a74. The implications of the\nresult and possible ways to reconcile the apparent discord between theory and observation\nare discussed in \u00a75. A summary of our conclusions is given in \u00a76.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData\nSample\n\nWe employ the rotation curve data and mass models compiled by Sanders & McGaugh\n(2002), as trimmed for quality by McGaugh (2005). These data originate from many independent observers, and represent the accumulated effort of a substantial community of\nastronomers. Sample galaxies span a wide range of morphological types, from Sab through\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nall spiral types to Irr/Im. Recent work by Noordermeer et al. (2005) focussing on the earliest (S0/Sa) type disk galaxies appears contiguous with the data used here. More important\nthan morphological type is the broad range of physical parameter space that our sample\nspans. It includes galaxies with circular velocities 50 < Vf < 300 km s\u22121 , baryonic masses\n3 \u00d7 108 < Mb < 4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , scale sizes 0.5 \u2264 Rd \u2264 13 kpc, central surface brightnesses\n\u22122\n19.6 \u2264 \u03bcB\n0 \u2264 24.2 mag. arcsec , and gas fractions 0.07 \u2264 fg \u2264 0.95. No restriction is made\non surface brightness or any other physical parameter. The sample represents the dynamics\nof disks in the broadest sense possible with available data.\nAll sample galaxies have high quality, extended rotation curves derived from 21 cm\ndata cubes. The high precision sample of McGaugh (2005) consists of 60 galaxies with\n\u223c 700 independent, resolved rotation velocity measurements, each with formal accuracy of\n5% or better. We choose to exclude data with r < 1 kpc where the controversy over cusp or\ncore occurs (de Blok 2004). The point here is to compare reliable data with the expectations\nof \u039bCDM models, free from concern over systematic uncertainties, either observational (such\nas beam smearing) or physical (e.g., non-circular motions). These may be serious concerns\nfor constraining the innermost slope of the density profile, but do not significantly affect the\ndata at intermediate radii. Here the data are well resolved, and the observed circular velocity\ngreatly exceeds the velocity dispersion. Indeed, strong constraints exist on the ellipticities of\nthe potentials for some sample galaxies (Schoenmakers, Franx, & de Zeeuw 1997). Triaxiality\nof the halo (e.g., Hyashi & Navarro 2006) is not relevant to the bulk of the data here.\nWe exclude the possibility of non-circular motions biasing the results at small radii by\ntruncating the inner data. Our result is not sensitive to the choice of the inner truncation\nradius. The total radial range sampled is from 1 to 74 kpc, with a median radius of 9 kpc.\nOnly a few galaxies have measured rotation extending to very large radii. The bulk of the\ndata (68%) fall in the range 4 < r < 22 kpc (Fig. 1). Data in this range are not only\nnumerous, but fall in a range where the systematic concerns discussed above have negligible\nimpact. The same result follows if we restrict the data to this very conservative range.\nFor many galaxies in the sample, the contribution of the stars to the total potential\ncan not be ignored. This dominates all other effects by far. It is necessary to subtract off\nthe baryonic contribution to reveal the velocity due to the halo. All galaxies have detailed\nsurface photometry from which baryonic mass models are derived.\nFor the present work, we utilize B-band surface photometry, as this is the only band\nthat all 60 galaxies have in common. We are working to place the sample on a uniform Ks band scale, but at present lack sufficiently deep observations of some of the fainter galaxies.\nUsing the Ks -band data already in hand does not alter the basic result (see also Verheijen\n2001; Verheijen & Sancisi 2001; Kassin et al. 2006).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nWe make no assumption about the light profile (e.g., exponential disk). The observed\nlight distribution is converted to a baryonic rotation curve numerically (via GIPSY: van der\nHulst et al. 1992). This includes the bulge (when present), stellar disk, and Hi gas. The\nmolecular gas distribution is not available in most cases, but this is likely to be a small\npercentage of the baryonic mass in the majority of late type galaxies (Young & Knezek\n1989). Moreover, the molecular gas generally follows the stellar distribution (Helfer et al.\n2003), so is effectively subsumed into the stellar mass-to-light ratio. It is the estimation of\nstellar mass that is most crucial.\n\n2.2.\n\nStellar Mass\n\nThe observed rotation curves provide a good map of the total gravitational potential\nthat is due to both baryonic and dark mass. While the total potential is well constrained,\ndividing it into baryonic and dark mass components is a degenerate process. Additional\ninformation is needed to break this degeneracy.\nWe explore three methods for estimating the stellar mass-to-light ratio \u03a5\u22c6 : maximum\ndisk, \u03a5max ; stellar population synthesis models, \u03a5pop ; and that from the mass discrepancy\u2013\nacceleration relation, \u03a5acc . This latter in effect treats MOND (Milgrom 1983) fits (Sanders\n& McGaugh 2002) as an empirical phenomenology. That this phenomenology is present in\nthe data is all that is required, regardless of the underlying physical reason for it (McGaugh\n2004).\nFollowing McGaugh (2005), we can choose any arbitrary stellar mass estimate by scaling\neach of these prescriptions by a constant factor \u0393, P, or Q:\n\u03a5\u22c6 = \u0393\u03a5max\n\n(1a)\n\n\u03a5\u22c6 = P\u03a5pop\n\n(1b)\n\n\u03a5\u22c6 = Q\u03a5acc .\n\n(1c)\n\nThis scheme allows us to explore the full range of possible stellar masses (0 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 1) with\nthree independent estimators for each galaxy. The population synthesis mass-to-light ratio\n\u03a5pop is estimated from the observed B \u2212 V color (as tabulated by McGaugh 2005) and the\nmodels of Bell et al. (2003b):\nlog \u03a5pop = 1.737(B \u2212 V ) \u2212 0.942\n\n(2)\n\nVery similar results follow from other models (e.g., Portinari et al. 2004). The chief uncertainty of this method is the IMF. P = 1 corresponds to the nominal \"scaled Salpeter\"\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nIMF adopted by Bell et al. (2003b), which for our purposes is nearly indistinguishable from\nthe Kroupa (2002) IMF adopted by Portinari et al. (2004; see also Portinari & SommerLarsen 2006). To consider the effects of a heavier or lighter IMF, we simply scale by P (see\ndiscussion in Bell & de Jong 2001).\n\n3.\n\nEmpirical Halo Estimates\n\nWe estimate the circular velocity provided by dark matter by subtracting the baryonic\ncomponent from the observed rotation curves for each choice of \u03a5\u22c6 :\nVh2 (r) = V 2 (r) \u2212 Vb2 (r).\n\n(3)\n\nHere Vh (r) is the rotation velocity attributed to the dark matter, V (r) is the observed\nrotation velocity, and Vb (r) is the rotation velocity attributed to baryons. This depends on\n\u03a5\u22c6 through Vb2 = \u03a5\u22c6 v\u22c62 + Vg2 , where v\u22c6 is the rotation velocity for \u03a5\u22c6 = 1 M\u2299 /L\u2299 . The\nHi gas component, corrected to account for helium and metals, gives Vg . Molecular gas\ngenerally traces the stellar distribution (Helfer et al. 2003) and is subsumed into \u03a5\u22c6 .\nAn example rotation curve is shown in Fig. 2. As we increase (decrease) \u03a5\u22c6 by varying\n\u0393, P, and Q, the stellar contribution to the total rotation increases (decreases) and the\ncorresponding contribution from the dark matter decreases (increases). Though the details\nof each realization depend on the \u03a5\u22c6 estimator and the relative importance of gas (which\ndoes not vary), it is a tolerable approximation to imagine the dark and baryonic lines in\nFig. 2 sliding up and down see-saw fashion.\nIn order to restrict our attention to the best data, we have excised individual points\nwith uncertainty in excess of 5%. In many cases, the formal precision is rather greater than\nthis limit. While this leaves plenty of data to analyze, various astrophysical considerations\nmake it unrealistic to consider those data with small error bars as accurate estimates of the\ncircular velocity of the potential (see discussions in McGaugh et al. 2001; de Blok et al.\n2003). We therefore give uniform weight to the data which pass the 5% criterion.\nA more serious uncertainty than that in the data is that in \u03a5\u22c6 . The estimate of stellar\nmass is the single dominant source of uncertainty in this analysis. The systematic nature of\nthis uncertainty makes it impossible to propagate it in a meaningful way. Hence we simply\nexamine the results of adopting each \u03a5\u22c6 estimator, leaving it to the reader's judgement which\ncase might seem best. Fortunately, the basic result is fairly insensitive to this choice.\nIn Fig. 3 we show Vh (r) for all 60 galaxies plotted together for the case of Q = 1.\nRemarkably, the inferred dark matter halos of all these galaxies fall more or less on top of\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\neach other. This is not to say that the dark matter halos of all galaxies are the same. Quite\nthe contrary, it is possible to observationally distinguish between the dark matter halos of\nindividual galaxies (Sancisi 2004; McGaugh 2004; Barnes et al. 2004; Simon et al. 2005).\nNonetheless, when plotted together in this fashion, the apparent variation is remarkably\nsmall.\nTaken together, the data suggest a relation\nlog Vh = C + B log r.\n\n(4)\n\nFitting the data with Q = 1 gives C = 1.48 \u00b1 0.01 and B = 0.49 \u00b1 0.01. While we\nwould not claim that this is a universal halo that all galaxies share, it does give a tolerable\napproximation of the velocity attributable to dark matter.\nWe can extend this approach to other mass-to-light values by varying \u0393, P, and Q. The\ncases \u0393 = 1, P = 1, Q = 1 and \u0393 = 0.4 (the latter as suggested1 by Bottema 1993 and\nCourteau & Rix 1999) are illustrated in Fig. 4. This figure is like Fig. 3 for the various mass\nestimators, but with shading to illustrate the density of data. The darker the shading, the\nmore sharply defined the relation between Vh and radius.\nThere is some covariance between the slope B and intercept C. Our purpose here is\nto constrain the amplitude of the velocity that can be attributed to dark matter. In order\nnot to obscure the basic result with uncertainties introduced by covariance, we fix the slope\nto B = 1/2, consistent with our data (see Figs. 5 \u2013 8) and those of Barnes et al. (2004).\nMoreover, the slope does not vary appreciably when left free; the important information is\ncontained in the amplitude.\nFixing B = 1/2 changes the Q = 1 best fit intercept to C = 1.47. This number encodes,\nin the simplest possible way, the amplitude of the dark matter velocity. Fig. 9 show how\nthis amplitude varies as we change \u03a5\u22c6 . For P = 1, the amplitude barely changes: C = 1.49.\nFor the full range of possibilities, from minimum to maximum disk, we find C(\u0393 = 0) = 1.62\nand C(\u0393 = 1) = 1.28. In other words, the amplitude of the velocity provided by the dark\nmatter falls in the range C = 1.47+0.15\n\u22120.19 for B = 1/2.\nOne can also see in Fig. 9 variation in the scatter about the mean. Remarkably, the\nscatter is minimized for Q = 1, the MOND mass-to-light ratios. This is also the choice\nof \u03a5\u22c6 which minimizes the scatter in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (McGaugh 2005)\nand, by construction, that in the mass discrepancy\u2013acceleration relation (McGaugh 2004).\n1\n\nThese authors phrase the disk contribution in terms of the velocity at 2.2 scale lengths. Since M \u221d V 2 ,\nV2.2 /Vtot = 0.63 corresponds to \u0393 = 0.4.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nIrrespective of the physics that causes it, this implies that MOND is an important empirical\norganizing relation that is relevant even to dark matter. The scatter is larger for other mass\nestimators, but the basic result encapsulated by C is the same.\n\n4.\n\n\u039bCDM Halos\n\nCosmological simulations lead to mass distributions for dark matter halos that have\ngravitational potentials which can be analytically approximated as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nln(1 + cx) \u2212 cx/(1 + cx)\n2\n2\nVh (r) = V200\n,\n(5)\nx[ln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)]\nwhere c = R200 /Rs and x = r/R200 (NFW). The radius R200 encloses a density 200 times\nthe critical density of the universe; V200 is the circular velocity of the potential at R200 .\nThe radius R200 is, crudely speaking, the virial radius in a critical density universe. For\ncurrent \u039bCDM parameters, the virial radius is more nearly at R100 (e.g., Eke, Navarro, &\nSteinmetz 2001). More recently, Navarro et al. (2004) have suggested that a density profile\nwith a continuously running slope provides a better fit to simulated halos than the original\nNFW formula. From an observational perspective, these forms are virtually indistinguishable. We therefore retain the NFW formulation for its familiarity and its well quantified\nrelation to cosmological parameters (NFW; McGaugh, Barker, & de Blok 2003).\nOne interesting aspect of the data is that there is no clear tendency for the dark halo\nrotation curves to flatten out. The combination of disk plus halo is often close to flat, and\nas the disk contribution is declining, it is natural to associate the flat rotation velocity with\nthe halo. This is, however, an oversimplification. In most cases, the inferred dark matter\ncontribution to the velocity is still rising at the last measured point, and it is not clear that\nthe observed flat velocity is truly representative of the halo.\nIn the context of simulated halos, the lack of a flat halo rotation velocity may help the\nmodels. NFW halos do not possess a significant range of radii where \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 , as needed to\nproduce flat rotation curves. Presumably, the observed range suffices only to cover the rising\nportion of the halo, with a suggestion of a turn-over in only a few sufficiently extended cases.\nIt remains an open question why the disk and halo conspire to produce nearly flat rotation\ncurves over the range observed.\nIt is suggestive that the fitted slope B \u2248 1/2 is that expected for the inner portion of\nNFW halos. It is tempting to conclude that halos are indeed NFW, and we will use this\nto compare the observed and predicted amplitudes C. An important caveat is that it is not\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nstraightforward to match the radial scale of simulated halos to that of real galaxies. It is for\nthis reason that the amplitude C provides the most robust comparison: it uses all the data\nto set the velocity scale, in effect providing an integrated measure that is not sensitive to\nsystematic effects in the way the innermost slope may be.\nThe slope of the data is, if anything, too close to a constant B = 1/2. NFW profiles\nhave this slope at small radii, though the exact slope the simulations predict is still debated\n(e.g., Ricotti 2003; Power et al. 2003; Navarro et al. 2004; Diemand et al. 2005). Irrespective\nof this detail, all simulations agree that the inner slope gradually transitions to a steeper fall\noff (becoming r \u22123 at large radii). The consequence is that there should be some curvature\napparent in Vh (r) over the radial range sampled by the data. This is not obvious in the\nobservations (Fig. 3). This difference between simulations and data is sufficiently large that\nthe difference between the various proposed analytic formulas is a rather small concern. The\nuse of individually simulated halos (e.g., Hayashi et al. 2004; cf. de Blok 2005) in preference\nto the analytic approximations should not make a difference to the radii of interest here,\nwhere the deviations between the various realizations of the simulation results are small.\nIn addition to the data, the upper panel of Fig. 3 shows the predicted shape and amplitude of NFW rotation curves for a range of V200 . Presuming galaxy halos span a range of\nmass comparable to that suggested by their luminosities, one would not only expect more\ncurvature than observed, but also a wider spread in Vh (compare, for example, the halos with\nV200 = 50 and 200 km s\u22121 ). That the data concentrate in this plane more than anticipated\nmight suggest that we may err in presuming that halo masses span the same range of mass\nas the observed luminosity, or that the simulated c-V200 relation built into the lines in the\nupper panel of Fig. 3 may not be precisely correct.\nOne must bear in mind, of course, that the data only extend over a finite range of\nradii, and do not generally show the inevitable maximum and decline in Vh . Though it is\ndifficult to assign a specific halo to a particular galaxy, taken together the data are suggestive\nof an envelope composed of halos of a range of masses. If we had complete knowledge of\nthe potentials out to arbitrary radii, we might see individual halos peeling away from this\nenvelope as illustrated by the lines in the bottom panel of Fig. 3.\nFor comparison with the data, we can ask what we would expect to find from a \u039bCDM\nmodel observed in the same way as the data. We sample a series of halos with 50 \u2264 V200 \u2264 300\n(e.g., the lines in the top panel of Fig. 3). Model data points are allowed to fill the space\navailable to them within the observed range of radii. The model points are uniformly sampled\nand weighted since we have no knowledge of the underlying halo mass distribution, other\nthan that it gives rise to the broad observed range of luminosities and rotation velocities.\nSince no turn-over (Vmax of the halo) is observed in the data, the maximum radius to which\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nhalos are sampled is truncated along the lower edge of the observed envelope, as defined by\na line with slope 1/2 and intercept 1.33. The result of fitting the model halos is C = 1.66\nand B = 0.48 for the vanilla \u039bCDM parameters of Tegmark et al. (2004). For the third\nyear WMAP parameters (Spergel et al. 2006), C decreases to 1.61. This normalization is\ntoo large, being consistent with the observed value only in the limit of zero stellar mass\n(C = 1.62).\nThe c-V200 relation can be adjusted in order to match the NFW model to the observed\namplitude of the data. This is illustrated in the lower panel of Fig. 3 by lines representing\nNFW halos with parameters chosen to match the observed normalization C. In effect, this\nprovides an empirical estimate of the c-V200 relation. We can do this for the value of C\nimplied by any choice of \u03a5\u22c6 . To get the zero point amplitude (C) for NFW, let us rewrite\nequation (5) in log-log space. In the limit2 x \u2192 0 we have:\n\nwhere\n\nlog Vh = 12 [log V200 + log[g(c)] + log(h/2)] + 12 log r,\n\n(6)\n\nc2\ng(c) =\nln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)\n\n(7)\n\nand the factor h = H0 /100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 appears because V200 = hR200 when V200 is in\nkm s\u22121 and R200 is in kpc (NFW). Written this way, we recognize log Vh = C + B log r with\nB = 1/2. We can thus relate NFW parameters to the data through the observed C:\nlog V200 = 2C \u2212 log[g(c)] \u2212 log(h/2)\n\n(8)\n\n(the data assume h = 0.75). In this fashion, we can generate the range of (c, V200 ) that are\nacceptable to the data (Fig. 10). Note that we do not specify the particular values of these\nparameters for any given galaxy. Rather, we constrain the range of c-V200 parameter space\nfrom which the observed halos may be drawn.\nThe parameters of NFW halos in simulations are not arbitrary. There is a correlation\nbetween c and V200 (NFW) with fairly modest3 scatter (Jing 2000; Bullock et al. 2001; Col\u0131\u0301n\n2\n\nThe limit x \u2192 0 might seem like a dubious approximation since we have excluded the data at r < 1 kpc.\nHowever, it is in fact quite a good approximation both theoretically (since x = r/R200 and we are concerned\nwith data at a small fraction of the virial radius) and empirically (since the observed slope is close to limiting\ncase of 1/2).\n3\n\nNote that the scatter found by Col\u0131\u0301n et al. (2004) is half that found by Bullock et al. (2001). We adopt\nthe more conservative (larger) scatter here. Adopting the smaller scatter would simply make the predicted\nbands in Fig. 10 2\u03c3 wide.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\net al. 2004). Moreover, the typical concentration depends on the cosmology (NFW). For a\n1012 M\u2299 halo, McGaugh et al. (2003) found that the mean\nc = 1.88 + 23.9\u03c38 T0.6\nwhere\nT0.6 =\n\n\u221a \u03a9\n(\u03a9b \u2212 2h \u03a9 b )\n0.6\nm\n\u03a9m he\n\n\u2212 0.32(n\u22121\ns \u2212 1).\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nNFW found that the density of halos depends on the density of the universe at the time of\ncollapse. This depends on \u03a9m and the amplitude of the power spectrum at the appropriate\nscale, as encapsulated by the above formula. The concentration varies slowly with scale V200\n(NFW).\nFor illustration, we adopt \u039bCDM parameters from the Tegmark et al. (2004) and Spergel\net al. (2006). We use the 6-parameter 'vanilla' fit of Tegmark et al. (2004), and the results of\nthe 3 year WMAP-only fit from Spergel et al. (2006). While superficially these may appear\nsimilar, the concentrations of dark matter halos are quite sensitive to cosmic parameters, so\nthere is a noticeable difference.\nThe observed and predicted c-V200 bands are illustrated in Fig. 10. For the scatter in\n\u039bCDM concentrations, we adopt \u03c3log c = 0.14 (Bullock et al. 2001). Similarly, we illustrate\nthe \u00b11 \u03c3 range of observed halos (i.e., the band that contains 68% of the halos from the\nhistograms in Figs. 6 and 7). The predicted and observed bands do not match up well,\nhaving only a modest range of overlap at surprisingly small V200 .\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe cusp-core problem in dwarf and LSB galaxies is well known. Inspection of Fig. 10\nreveals a more general problem with the densities of the dark matter halos of all spiral galaxies. The data are consistent with a swath of c-V200 space that does not parallel the predictions\nof \u039bCDM. The acceptable regions of halo parameter space diverge as mass increases.\nThis result can not be attributed to inadequate resolution or slit positioning errors. All\nof the data are derived from resolved two dimensional velocity fields. We have intentionally\nexcluded data from the innermost region where the resolution might be questioned. Significant non-circular motions could be seen directly in the velocity fields. The result does not\nchange if we exclude4 even more of the inner data (see Fig. 1; imagine truncating Fig. 3 at\n4\n\nThis result is slightly less restrictive than the maximum halo acceleration limit (Brada & Milgrom 1999;\nMcGaugh 2004) because we ignore here r = 0 where NFW halos provide their maximum acceleration.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n2 or 3 kpc). It is the velocity attributable to dark matter at well resolved intermediate radii\nthat is lower than expected in \u039bCDM.\nLet us examine the implications of this result, and possible ways out, starting with the\ntheoretical expectations. Two fiducial \u039bCDM models are illustrated in Fig. 10. The model\nof Tegmark et al. (2004) is a good representation of standard vanilla \u039bCDM, predicting very\nnearly the same swath of c-V200 parameter space as other plausible choices for cosmological\nparameters, going back to the early work of NFW. The WMAP three year results (Spergel\net al. 2006) noticeably lower the predicted halo concentrations. This is due to slight changes\nin all of the relevant parameters. The dominant effect is from the lower power spectrum\nnormalization \u03c38 = 0.90 \u2192 0.74, a result anticipated both by cluster (e.g., Rosati, Borgani,\n& Norman, 2002; Diego et al. 2003) and galaxy work (Zentner & Bullock 2002; McGaugh\net al. 2003; van den Bosch, Mo, & Yang 2003). The tilt (n = 0.99 \u2192 0.95) and the lower\nmatter density (\u03a9m = 0.27 \u2192 0.24) also contribute. As we add in large scale constraints\nbeside WMAP, the parameters tend5 to drift back towards those of Tegmark et al. (2004).\nThe lower concentrations implied by the more recent WMAP results do help. Ignoring\nthe trend with V200 for the moment, equation (9) implies c = 7.6 for the cosmic parameters of\nTegmark et al. (2004), whereas the new WMAP data (Spergel et al. 2006) imply c = 5.9. This\ndifference is quite pronounced in rotation curves. The revised WMAP results at least bring\ncosmic data into the right ballpark: McGaugh et al. (2003) found c \u2248 5.7 for dark matter\ndominated galaxies, though it should be noted that this typical value ignores problematic\ncases with c < 2 or for which NFW simply does not fit.\nThe problem here is not so much the mean concentration, but the run of concentration with halo mass. Concentrations are acceptable for low mass halos (those with\nV200 . 100km s\u22121 ). They become increasingly discrepant with increasing mass. By the\ntime we reach V200 = 163 km s\u22121 (1012 M\u2299 ), the data imply c = 3. This is nominally the\nmass scale of the Milky Way (e.g., Wilkinson & Evans 1999; Sakamoto, Chiba, & Beers\n2003), and the low inferred concentration is consistent with both Milky Way constraints\n(Binney & Evans 2001; Flynn et al. 2006) and those for comparable galaxies (e.g, Weiner et\nal. 2001). To obtain such a low concentration from initial conditions would require absurd\nchanges to cosmology: \u03c38 \u2248 0.3 or \u03a9m \u2248 0.05.\nThis basic result is virtually independent of the choice of mass-to-light ratio estimator.\nThe distribution of Vh is not as sharply peaked for P = 1 as it is for Q = 1, but the mean\nis nearly the same, so the same result is obtained. Worse, changing P (or Q or \u0393) simply\nshifts the bands left (for P > 1) or right (for P < 1) in Fig. 10. It does little to alter the\n5\n\nSee http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/parameters.cfm\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ndiffering slope of the observed and predicted c-V200 bands.\nIn order to fix the mismatched slopes with \u03a5\u22c6 , we would have to make the stellar mass\nindicator a systematic function of V200 . Specifically, \u03a5\u22c6 would have to get progressively\nsmaller as halo mass increases. This is quite contrived. There is no evidence to suggest that\nthe stellar populations of massive spirals are systematically lighter than those of dwarfs.\nIndeed, such a contention can likely already be excluded by the need for a substantial stellar\ncontribution to the mass in at least some high surface brightness galaxies (e.g., Debattista &\nSellwood 2000; Weiner et al. 2001; Kassin et al. 2006; Battaglia et al. 2006). In contradiction\nto this, Jimenez, Verde, & Oh (2003) argue that rotation curve fits tolerate the expected\nconcentrations for NFW halos. However, this comes at the expense of unrealistic \u03a5\u22c6 . The\nI-band \u03a5\u22c6 distribution of Jimenez et al. (2003) is bimodal (their Fig. 7), with roughly\nhalf of the galaxies centered on \u03a5\u22c6 \u2248 0.2M\u2299 /L\u2299 . So they in fact find the same result,\nthat mass-to-light ratios need to be quite low in order to be reconciled with the expected\nNFW concentrations. A velocity-variable IMF might achieve this, but it would introduce an\nunreasonable amount of scatter into the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (McGaugh 2005).\nThe mismatch between the slopes of the observational and theoretical bands in Fig. 10\nis caused by the near universality of the empirical dark matter halo found in \u00a73. The data\ncan be described, albeit crudely, by a single simple form (equation 4). According to NFW,\nthis should not be the case - halos should spread out (e.g., top panel of Fig. 3), not clump\ntogether as observed. In this case, we would expect to see more data at high Vh at small r.\nWhile there are choices of \u03a5\u22c6 that have some data in this region, the bulk of the data do\nnot reside there (Fig. 4).\nThe slope of the observed bands in Fig. 10 is the result of adjusting the NFW halos\nconcentrations to match the data with B \u2261 1/2. It is worth checking how this changes if we\nallow the slope to be free. A \u03a5\u22c6 choice that leads to a shallower slope and higher amplitude\nis needed to reconcile the data with the model.\nLeaving both the slope and the intercept free in the fit, we obtain C = 1.43 and B = 0.58\nfor P = 1. This steeper slope goes in the wrong direction, as it would make the P = 1 band\nin Fig. 10 cut somewhat more steeply across the predicted band. Using the two dozen\ngalaxies for which we have K-band data and assuming a constant \u03a5\u22c6 = 0.7 M\u2299 /L\u2299 (the\nP = 1 value for the mean color), we obtain C = 1.53 and B = 0.49, consistent with\nQ = 1. Increasing the stellar mass makes things worse, maximum disk being the limiting\ncase (C = 1.17 and B = 0.64 for \u0393 = 1): there is too little velocity attributable to dark\nmatter at small radii. Lowering the stellar mass within reasonable bounds does not help\neither. For P = 1/2, C = 1.59 and B = 0.49. This a band with precisely the same slope\nas illustrated; the change in C only shifts the band a bit to the right. The case of \u0393 = 0.4\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n(Bottema 1993) gives results indistinguishable from P = 1/2. To push the stellar mass\nlow enough to get into the right ballpark, we need P . 0.3 (C = 1.65 and B = 0.44 for\nP = 0.3). This corresponds to an IMF that is a factor of 5 less massive than Salpeter.\nThis is below the practical minimum in stellar mass as determined from direct integration\nof the observed IMF (Kroupa 2002). It is also grossly inconsistent with the coherence of the\nmass discrepancy\u2013acceleration relation (McGaugh 2004) and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation\n(McGaugh 2005), the presence of baryonic features observed in rotation curves (Palunas &\nWilliams 2000; Sancisi 2004; Kassin et al. 2006; Battaglia et al. 2006), observed velocity\ndispersions (Bottema 1997; Kregel, van der Kruit & Freeman 2005), and hydrodynamical\nflows (Weiner et al. 2001; Kranz, Slyz & Rix 2003). There appears to be no plausible choice\nof \u03a5\u22c6 that is consistent with cosmological expectations and NFW, at least for halos with\nV200 comparable to the observed circular velocity.\nWe have so far implicitly assumed that halo mass scales linearly with baryonic mass.\nThis need not be the case. One possibility to consider it that the observed luminosity function\nof galaxies descends from parent dark matter halos spanning a smaller range of mass. This\nwould require a systematic variation in the fraction of baryons that form the luminous disk\n(McGaugh & de Blok 1998; Okamoto et al. 2005), but this may already be required to match\nthe observed Tully-Fisher relation (van den Bosch 2000; Mo & Mao 2004; see also Navarro\n& Steinmetz 2000; Eke et al. 2001; Portinari & Sommer-Larsen 2006; Dutton et al. 2006).\nIf we drop the assumption that total mass scales with baryonic mass, it is tempting\nto conclude that galaxies may be born from halos in the region allowed in Fig. 10. This\nwould mean that even massive galaxies with observed rotation velocities in excess of 200\nkm s\u22121 (ranging all the way up to 300 km s\u22121 ) would have their origins in relatively modest\nhalos. From Fig. 10, we need V200 < 100km s\u22121 for vanilla \u039bCDM, and V200 < 180km s\u22121\nfor WMAP third year parameters. Galaxies would presumably gain their larger observed\nvelocities during the collapse of their massive disks (see below).\nExamination of Figs. 3 and 4 reveals that halos with V200 \u2248 100km s\u22121 are about right\nto explain much of the data. Unfortunately, such low mass halos do not provide a complete\nexplanation. For one thing, there need to be enough baryons available in the halo to form\nthe observed galaxy. Assuming a universal baryon fraction of 0.17 (Spergel et al. 2006), and\nthe most favorable case that all baryons within R200 collapse to form the visible galaxy, a\nhalo with V200 = 100km s\u22121 has enough baryons to make a galaxy with Vf = 167km s\u22121 .\nThis assumes Q = 1 mass-to-light ratios and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of McGaugh\n(2005). There is some room to play with the choice of \u03a5\u22c6 , but this does little more than\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nassuage the extreme assumption that all baryons6 collapse to form the observed galaxy. It is\ntherefore rather difficult to ascribe the known spiral galaxies with 200 < Vf < 300km s\u22121 to\nNFW halos of low mass but normal concentration, at least for vanilla \u039bCDM. This constraint\nis relaxed for WMAP 3 year parameters, but even here a halo with V200 = 180km s\u22121 can\ngive at most enough baryons for a galaxy with Vf = 260km s\u22121 (again taking Q = 1).\nLooking in detail, NFW halos obeying the expected c-V200 relation have more curvature\nthan observed, predicting too high a velocity at small r and too small a velocity at large\nr relative to the data. Even if we overlook the over-prediction at r \u223c 5 kpc, the underprediction at r > 20 kpc is quite serious. The compressive formation of a massive disk can\nraise Vh , but this process is much more effective at small radii than at large radii. In order\nto explain the high observed dark halo velocity at large radii, it seems necessary to have\ninitial halos with at least V200 \u2248 200km s\u22121 . Such halos grossly over-predict Vh at small r if\nthey obey the vanilla c-V200 relation. It may be tempting to simply ignore the data at large\nradii, as there are relatively few with r > 30 kpc. However, there do exist galaxies outside\nthis sample (e.g., Noordermeer et al. 2005; Spekkens & Giovanelli 2006) with outer rotation\nvelocities approaching 300 km s\u22121 . These galaxies show no sign of a turn down in their outer\nvelocities, and obey the same scaling relations as those in the present sample, so there is\nno reason to expect them to be any different. The need for large Vh at large radii is thus a\nserious problem.\nSo far, we have compared the data to the \u039bCDM predictions for primordial dark matter\nhalos. It is possible that the process of galaxy formation alters the halos. If so, the difference\nbetween the predictions and observations might be interpreted to show what changes occur\nin this process. One should bear in mind that cuspy mass distributions seem to be a generic\nresult of cold collapse (e.g., Huss et al. 1999), and that, once established, it is very hard to\nunbind the mass in the deep potential wells of cuspy halos. Achieving the desired effect is\nthus a tall order from the outset (Sommer-Larsen & Dolgov 2001; Eke et al. 2001).\nThe primary physical effect which should occur during galaxy formation is the adiabatic\ncontraction of the dark matter halo in response to the collapse of the baryonic disk (e.g.,\nBlumenthal et al. 1986; Barnes & White 1984; Gnedin et al. 2004; Sellwood & McGaugh\n2005; Choi et al. 2006). The effect of adiabatic contraction is to further concentrate the dark\nmatter. This goes in the wrong direction to help with the problems discussed here. However,\nthere are two distinct aspects of adiabatic contraction to consider. The slope \u03b3 will steepen\nfrom its initial value; this goes in the wrong direction. The velocity provided by the dark\nmatter also increases. While this might also seem to act in the wrong direction, it means\n6\n\nIn \u039bCDM, the virial radius is closer to R100 than R200 , further reducing the number of available baryons.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthat a galaxy of a given rotation velocity may form in a halo with lower primordial V200 . As\ndiscussed above, this can help, at least in principle. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that\nthe effect can be large enough to help at large radii without simultaneously doing far too\nmuch at small radii. Disks heavy enough to have a substantial impact on outer velocities\ngrossly over-predict inner velocities if the starting point is an NFW halo (Abadi et al. 2003;\nSellwood & McGaugh 2005). To make matters worse, Dutton et al. (2006) argue that a\nlarge difference between the observed and initial halo velocity scales would make reconciling\nthe normalization problem between Tully-Fisher and the luminosity function practically\nimpossible. Low mass halos might also be inconsistent with constraints from weak lensing\n(Smith et al. 2001; Mandelbaum et al. 2006).\nAfter adiabatic contraction, there may be some subsequent process that further alters\nthe halo. Perhaps the most common example is feedback from star formation. Quite generically, the effects of feedback are believed to be stronger in lower mass galaxies owing to their\nshallower potential wells (e.g., Thacker & Couchman 2000). Such an effect is unlikely to be\nsufficiently strong (Mac Low & Ferrara 1999; Gnedin & Zhao 2002) and acts preferentially\non the wrong end of the mass function. It is the concentrations of high mass galaxies (if\nnot necessarily the slope \u03b3) that are most deviant from the predictions of \u039bCDM. If the\nsolution to this problem lies in the processes of galaxy formation, it likely resides in a rather\ndifferent direction (see, for example, El-Zant et al. 2001; Weinberg & Katz 2002; Merritt\net al. 2004; Ma & Boylan-Kolchin 2004; Mashchenko, Couchman, & Wadsley 2006; Tonini,\nLapi, & Salucci 2006; see also Sellwood 2006).\nAnother approach would be to alter the initial conditions. A turndown in the power\nspectrum on galaxy scales can reduce halo concentrations. However, such a solution would\nrequire a rather strange dip in the power spectrum. Concentrations at small scales are not\nunreasonable, and also make sense on larger (cluster) scales (e.g., Vikhlinin et al. 2006). It\nis the intermediate scale of massive spirals, giant ellipticals (Romanowsky et al. 2003; Pierce\net al. 2006), and groups (Karachentsev 2005) where the halo concentration prediction7 of\n\u039bCDM simulations fares worst.\nAnother possibility is to modify the nature of dark matter. The cusp-core problem has\nalready motivated consideration of various possibilities, such as warm (Bode, Ostriker, &\nTurok 2001), fuzzy (Hu, Barkana, & Gruzinov 2000), self-interacting (Spergel & Steinhardt\n2000), and meta-cold (Strigari et al. 2006) dark matter, among others (e.g., Piazza & Mari7\n\nThe prediction of a steep inner slope, \u03b3 \u2248 1 - the shape rather than the amplitude - continues to\nsuffer most clearly in LSB systems (Simon et al. 2005; Kuzio de Naray et al. 2006; Goerdt et al. 2006;\nSanchez-Salcedo et al. 2006).\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nnoni 2003; Lee & Lee 2004; Blanchet 2006). It is not immediately clear how any of these\nproposals fare in the current context. However, many proposals seem to be meant to produce\ndark matter halos with a core. This in itself is not a complete solution. One must get the\ndensity right, and do so on all relevant scales.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have examined the rotation curves of a large sample of spiral galaxies in order to\nconstrain the velocity that can be attributed to dark matter. Taken together, the dark halo\nvelocity can be approximated by\nlog Vh = C + B log r\nwith B \u2248 1/2 and C = 1.47+0.15\n\u22120.19 . The value of C depends on the choice of stellar mass-to-light\nratio, with the uncertainty corresponding to the full range of possibilities from minimum to\nmaximum disk. While the dark matter halos of individual galaxies must differ, this relation\ngives a tolerable approximation over the observed range.\nIn the context of \u039bCDM, the densities of halos depends on cosmology. For reasonable\ncosmological parameters, we expect C > 1.6. This is only consistent with the data in the\nlimit \u03a5\u22c6 \u2192 0, which is excluded by a wide variety of independent lines of evidence. The\nproblem is not just that rotation curve data prefer halo models with a core over those with\na cusp. The amplitude of the velocity provided by dark matter is too low at all observed\nradii.\nWe have emphasized here the importance of spiral galaxy dark matter halo densities\nbeing substantially lower than anticipated by \u039bCDM. For halos of 1012 M\u2299 , the density discrepancy is nearly an order of magnitude (see also Sellwood 2006). Getting the halo density\nin the right ballpark would be an important step towards a successful theory. Ultimately,\none must explain in detail the observed coupling between dark and baryonic components\n(e.g., Sancisi 2004; McGaugh 2004).\nWe thank the referee for comments which made this manuscript more clear and led to\nsubstantial improvements in the figures.

Data with r < 1 kpc (unshaded portion of histogram) are excluded from further analysis. The dotted lines illustrate\nthe range 4 < r < 22 kpc containing 68% of the data, with equal numbers on either side of\nthe median (9 kpc). These data at intermediate radii dominate the signal and subsequent\nresult.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The rotation curve and mass model of NGC 2403 in log-log space. The Hi data\nare from Begeman (1987; see also Fraternali et al. 2002), H\u03b1 (i) from Blais-Ouellette et al.\n(2004), and H\u03b1 (ii) from Daigle et al. (2006). The H\u03b1 data are shown to illustrate the degree\nto which independent data sets agree, but only the HI data are used in the analysis. The\nsolid lines show the mass model Vb of the baryons for two choices of \u03a5\u22c6 , \u0393 = 0.9 (upper) and\nP = 1 (lower). The dashed lines show the resulting halo rotation curves Vh for each \u03a5\u22c6 . The\nupper dashed line corresponds to the lower baryonic line and vice-versa. The dotted line at\nr = 1 kpc demarcates where the innermost data are ignored.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The rotation velocity Vh attributable to the dark matter halos of 60 galaxies\n(points) for Q = 1 stellar masses. Taken together, these data form a narrow sequence that\nis well described by log Vh = 1.47 + 0.5 log R (straight line). Also shown are galaxy mass\nNFW halos with V200 = 50, 100, 200, and 300 km s\u22121 (curved lines). In the top panel, these\nare drawn for the concentrations predicted for the vanilla \u039bCDM parameters of Tegmark et\nal. (2004). In the lower panel, the c \u2212 V200 relation has been adjusted to match the data.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Dark halo velocities, as per Fig. 3. The data are represented here as a grayscale to\nshow the density of the data. Darker shades representing regions of higher density; lighter\nshades those of low density. In regions of very low data density, individual points are shown\nas dots. While the eye may be attracted to outliers in Fig. 3, here it is clear how sharply\ndefined Vh (r) is. Several choices of mass-to-light ratio are illustrated: maximum disk (\u0393 = 1,\ntop left); stellar population synthesis (P = 1, top right); MOND (Q = 1, bottom left \u2013 the\nsame as in Fig. 3); and sub-maximal (Bottema 1993) disks (\u0393 = 0.4, bottom right).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The distribution about the line fit to the Q = 1 case for maximum disk mass-tolight ratios (\u0393 = 1). In essence, this is the cross-section of the corresponding pane in Fig. 4.\nAll the data are shown in the first panel, with subsequent panels showing the data falling\nin radial bins containing approximately equal numbers of data points. Scatter causes some\nindividual points to imply a negative dark mass. These are placed in the bin at the left edge\nof the plot. The variation of the mean \u03b4 log V illustrates how the characteristic amplitude of\nthe dark matter velocity C shifts with \u03a5\u22c6 , becoming lower in this case. The radially binned\nplots illustrate how the distribution varies. That the centroid in these bins does not vary\nmuch shows the approximate constancy of the slope B.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- As per Fig. 5, but for population synthesis stellar mass estimates (P = 1).\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- As per Fig. 5, but for MOND (Q = 1) mass-to-light ratios. Note how sharply\ndefined the peak in Vh is for this choice of \u03a5\u22c6 .\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- As per Fig. 5, but for sub-maximal disks with \u0393 = 0.4.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Variation of the scatter (left) and mean zero point velocity (\u2206C from Q = 1; right)\nwith stellar mass prescription scaling factor (Q: solid line; P: dotted line; \u0393: dashed line).\nA clear minimum in the scatter occurs at Q = 1. The variation for Q > 1 is not smooth as\nindividual galaxies are excluded as the prescription causes them to exceed maximum disk.\nNote that for low stellar masses (Q, P < 0.8, \u0393 < 0.4) the different prescriptions give\nindistinguishable mean C.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- The dark matter halo concentration\u2013virial velocity plane. Blue (P = 1) and gray\n(Q = 1) bands show the region consistent with the data for those choices of mass-to-light\nratio estimator. Orange and red bands show the region that NFW halos are predicted to\noccupy for the cosmological parameters of Tegmark et al. (2004) and Spergel et al. (2006),\nrespectively. In both cases, the width of the bands is \u00b11\u03c3. The predicted bands assume an\nintrinsic scatter of \u03c3c = 0.14 (Bullock et al. 2001). The width of the predicted bands would\nshrink and the region where they overlap would be reduced if we adopted the smaller scatter\n(\u03c3c = 0.11 for relaxed halos) advocated by Col\u0131\u0301n et al. (2004). The predicted concentrations\noverlap with the data over a rather narrow range. This range would of course shrink for a\nsmaller intrinsic scatter in c. Theory and data diverge with increasing V200 . The divergence\nis most pronounced for the range of halo masses typically assumed to be associated with L\u2217\ngalaxies.\n\n\f"}
