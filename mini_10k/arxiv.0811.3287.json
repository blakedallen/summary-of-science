Rotation periods and projected equatorial velocities of pre-main-sequence (PMS)\nstars in star forming regions can be combined to give projected stellar radii. Assuming random axial orientation, a Monte-Carlo model is used to illustrate that distributions of projected\nstellar radii are very sensitive to ages and age dispersions between 1 and 10 Myr which, unlike age estimates from conventional Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, are relatively immune to\nuncertainties due to extinction, variability, distance etc. Application of the technique to the\nOrion Nebula cluster reveals radius spreads of a factor of 2\u20133 (FWHM) at a given effective\ntemperature. Modelling this dispersion as an age spread suggests that PMS stars in the ONC\nhave an age range larger than the mean cluster age, that could be reasonably described by the\nage distribution deduced from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These radius/age spreads are\ncertainly large enough to invalidate the assumption of coevality when considering the evolution\nof PMS properties (rotation, disks etc.) from one young cluster to another.\nKeywords. stars: pre\u2013main-sequence, stars: rotation, stars: formation\n\n1. Introduction\nDoes star formation take a long time, or is it all over on a dynamical free-fall timescale?\nThis is a keenly debated question in star formation theory, with implications spanning\ntopics as diverse as investigating early star/disk/planet evolution using populations in\nyoung star formation regions (SFRs) which are often assumed to be coeval, through to\nassessing overall star formation efficiency and the build up of galactic populations.\nAccording to one paradigm, the collapse of molecular clouds is a quasi-static process\nslowed by magnetic pressure. The timescale for star formation is governed by ambipolar\ndiffusion and could be \u2243 10 Myr (e.g. Tan, Krumholz & McKee 2006). Alternatively, on\nthe basis of short deduced molecular cloud lifetimes, others argue that star formation is\na rapid process, taking place in compressed filamentary structures on free-fall timescales\n6 1 Myr (e.g. Elmegreen 2007).\nA crucial piece of evidence for star formation timescales is the presence (or not) of age\nspreads among stars in young SFRs. Low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars can be assigned model-dependent ages from their position in Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagrams\nas they contract along Hayashi tracks. Using this technique several authors (e.g. Palla\n& Stahler 2000; Huff & Stahler 2006) claim star formation \"accelerates\" exponentially\nup to the present day, on timescales of \u2243 10 Myr. These apparent age spreads favour\nquasi-static, \"slow\" star formation. However, conventional H-R diagrams are severely affected by (i) intrinsic variability, (ii) extinction uncertainties, (iii) accretion luminosity,\n(iv) binarity, (v) distance dispersion \u2013 all of which can mimic age spreads where none\nexist (e.g. Hartmann 2001; Hillenbrand, Bauermeister & White 2008).\nIn this contribution I illustrate a technique to circumvent these difficulties using the\nrotational properties of PMS stars. This produces an alternative H-R diagram (radius\nversus temperature) that can be modelled to reconstruct a star formation history free\nfrom the problems above (e.g. see Jeffries 2007a,b).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nR. D. Jeffries\n\n2. Projected stellar radii\nNew wide-field surveys are finding rotation periods (P in days) for hundreds of magnetically spotted PMS stars in SFRs. At the same time, it is now possible to obtain\nprojected equatorial velocities (v sin i in km s\u22121 ) for these stars from rotational line\nbroadening using multi-object spectrographs such as FLAMES at the VLT and Hectoechelle at the MMT. Combining these measurements gives geometric estimates of radii,\nR sin i = 0.02 P v sin i (in solar radii). The inclination angle, i, is unknown, but if it is\nassumed random (for which there is some evidence \u2013 e.g. Jackson & Jeffries in these proceedings \u2013 and no counter evidence) and the measurement uncertainties are understood,\nthen distributions of R sin i can be Monte-Carlo modelled to estimate the true R for any\ngroup of stars.\nAs an example of the technique's power, in Fig. 1 I show a simulation of what could be\nachieved by observing projected equatorial velocities for 458 PMS objects with rotation\nperiods in the young SFR NGC 2264 (from Lamm et al. 2004 and Makidon et al. 2004),\nwith a 10% precision and a threshold for detection of v sin i > 15 km s\u22121 \u2013 which is\nroutinely possible. The simulation assumes that rotation axes are randomly oriented but\nthat objects with i < 30\u25e6 do not show rotational modulation. The left hand panels show\nthe recovered R sin i values versus V \u2212 I for coeval populations at several ages, where\nthe Siess, Dufour & Forestini (2000, S00) isochrones are used to assign the intrinsic\nstellar radii. The right hand panels collapse this distribution to 1-dimensional form by\nnormalising R sin i at each colour by the value of R at 3 Myr.\nWith typical measurements, a set of 20 R sin i values can give R to \u00b15%. But at a\ngiven colour or Teff , R is expected to change by a factor of three between 1 and 10 Myr!\nHence the R sin i distribution is very sensitive to age differences and age dispersions in\nthis range (see right panels of Fig. 1), but becomes less so at older ages. Any inferred\nages and age spreads are of course model-dependent, but the radii are absolute. The\ntechnique is almost immune to problems associated with variability, binarity, extinction\nuncertainty and accretion luminosity. It is also distance-independent to boot!\n\n3. Results for the Orion Nebula Cluster\nThe first attempts to use this technique were made in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).\nThe results were described in detail by Jeffries (2007b) and are summarised here. The\nONC is a young and populous SFR with a sample of 95 K- and M-stars that have\nmeasured rotation periods (Herbst et al. 2002), effective temperatures (Hillenbrand 1997)\nand v sin i (Rhode, Herbst & Mathieu 2001; Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2005).\nI calculated R sin i for these stars and then simulated the normalised (to R3Myr ) distributions using the Monte Carlo model which produced the simulations in Fig. 1. The\nmodels were tested against the observed data using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff statistic\non the cumulative distributions. The simulations are insensitive to the threshold i below\nwhich it is assumed no rotational periodicity would be found, but are sensitive to the\nchoice of radius isochrones. I ran models using the S00 and D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997,\nDAM97) isochrones. Uncertainties in periods, v sin i and Teff were taken from the sources\ncited above.\nThe first models I tried were coeval with the age as a free parameter. The best-fitting\nages were 1.78 Myr and 0.76 Myr for the S00 and DAM97 isochrones, but both were\nrejected as good models at the > 95% level (see Fig. 2). New models were generated by\nallowing the radius to spread around a single coeval value. The spread was characterised\nby a Gaussian \u03c3r in log10 R. These generated good fits with central ages very similar to\n\n\f3\n\nAge spreads in SFRs?\n50\nN2264 Siess isoradii\n\n3\n\n40\n2.5\n\n2\n\n30\n\nFrequency\n\nR sin(i) (solar radii)\n\n1.0\n1.0 Myr\n\n1.5\n\n20\n\n3.0 Myr\n\n1\n10\n\n10 Myr\n\n0.5\n\n30 Myr\n\nAge 1.0 Myr\n\n100 Myr\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nV-I\n\n1\n1.5\nRsini/R3Myr\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n50\n3.0\n\nN2264 Siess isoradii\n\n3\n\n40\n2.5\n\n1.0 Myr\n\n2\n\n30\n\nFrequency\n\nR sin(i) (solar radii)\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n20\n\n3.0 Myr\n\n1\n10\n\n10 Myr\n\n0.5\n\n30 Myr\n\nAge 3.0 Myr\n\n100 Myr\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\nV-I\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nRsini/R3Myr\n\n50\nN2264 Siess isoradii\n\n3\n\n40\n10\n\n2.5\n\n1.0 Myr\n\n2\n\n30\n\nFrequency\n\nR sin(i) (solar radii)\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n3.0 Myr\n\n20\n\n1\n10 Myr\n\n0.5\nAge 10 Myr\n\n100 Myr\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n10\n\n30 Myr\n\n2\n\n2.5\nV-I\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nRsini/R3Myr\n\nFigure 1.

Also shown is a model with a\nGaussian spread (\u03c3r = 0.15 dex) in log10 R which provides a much better fit. In both cases, the\ncentral age for the distribution is 1.78 Myr. (Right) The probability distribution for \u03c3r using\neither the S00 or DAM97 isochrones. The 90% confidence region for the S00 isochrones is shown,\nbut the result is almost identical for the DAM97 isochrones. This modelling implies a spread of\na factor 2\u20133 (FWHM) in radius at a given Teff .\n\nthe previous coeval model, but with \u03c3r \u2243 (0.15 \u00b1 0.08) dex (90% confidence interval) for\nboth sets of isochrones (see Fig. 2). This implies linear radius spreads of a factor of 2\u20133\n(FWHM) at a given Teff .\nRather than a simple radius spread it is natural to interpret the results in terms of an\nage spread.

For\nthe Gaussian model the best fitting dispersion \u03c3a \u2243 0.4 dex is independent of isochrone\nchoice, but with model-dependent central ages similar to those given by the coeval models.\nThe exponential model has a best-fitting \u03bba \u2243 1.1 Myr for the DAM97 isochrones and\n\u03bba \u2243 1.9 Myr for the S00 isochrones.\n(b) The data are incapable of distinguishing between the exponentially accelerating\nmodel or the Gaussian spread in log10 age.\n(c) Modelling the R sin i distribution using the ages derived from the H-R diagram\n(see Fig. 4) gives a reasonable fit for both sets of isochrones.\n\n\f5\n\nAge spreads in SFRs?\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\nDAM97\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c3a (dex)\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c3a (dex)\n\nS00\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n5.4\n\n5.6\n\n5.8\n\n6\n\n6.2\n\n6.4\n\n5.8\n\nLog Central Age (Myr)\n\n6\n\n6.2\n\n6.4\n\n6.6\n\nLog Central Age (Myr)\n\n2\n\n4\nDAM97\n\nS00\n\n3.5\n\n1.5\n\n3\n\n\u03bba (Myr)\n\n\u03bba (Myr)\n\n2.5\n1\n\n2\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\nLog zero point age (Myr)\n\n6.5\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\nLog zero point age (Myr)\n\nFigure 3.

For each model we show the results using either the S00 or\nDAM97 isochrones. The contours enclose 68%, 90% and 99% of the probability.\n\n4. Discussion\nAlthough the absolute ages and age dispersions derived with this technique are to\nsome extent model-dependent, the absolute radii and radius dispersion are geometric\nestimates. We conclude that there is very strong evidence for spreads amounting to\nfactors of 2-3 (FWHM) in radius at a given Teff in PMS stars of the ONC. As PMS\ntracks are close-to-vertical in the H-R diagram for low-mass stars, this implies order-of-\n\n\f6\n\nR. D.

(Left) Normalised age distribution of ONC PMS stars estimated from the H-R\ndiagram and S00 isochrones. I show normalised distributions for the rotation sample and the\nfull sample of Hillenbrand (1997). The rotation sample is missing some of the \"oldest\" stars.\n(Right) The R sin i distribution modelled using the age distribution for the rotation sample in\nthe left-hand panel is a reasonable fit to the observed R sin i distribution.\n\nmagnitude spreads in moment of inertia \u2013 a fact that cannot be ignored when considering\nthe angular momentum evolution of PMS stars in SFRs.\nWhether these radius spreads represent real age spreads is a moot point. It is possible\nthat differing accretion histories could lead to luminosity/radius differences for coeval\nstars of similar present-day Teff . However, according to current, non-accreting models,\nthe data imply age spreads in the ONC that are larger than its mean age (> 2 Myr for the\nS00 models), consistent with age spreads judged from its conventional H-R diagram, and\ncertainly large enough to compromise any coeval assumption. In addition, the spreads we\nhave found may actually be underestimates. The rotation sample in the ONC is clearly\nbiased against the faintest (possibly oldest?) stars (see Fig. 4). We cannot comment on\nwhether age spreads as large as 10 Myr are likely until these low-luminosity outliers in\nthe ONC have their periods and projected rotation velocities measured.\nReferences\nD'Antona, F. & Mazzitelli, I. 1997, MemSAI, 68, 807\nElmegreen, B.
