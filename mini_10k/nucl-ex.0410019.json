Introduction\nRecently the development of the radioactive ion beam (RIB) technique has stimulated the research of structure\nand reaction for exotic nuclei both experimentally and theoretically [1-3]. The studies using RIB demonstrated that a\nlarge enhancement of the total reaction cross section (\u03c3I) induced by neutron rich nuclei was found which was\ninterpreted as neutron halo[4-7] ( such as 11Li, 11,14Be and 19C etc ) and neutron skin ( such as 6He and 8He )\nstructure[4]. The halo structure of 11Li seems to be consistent with all the experimental results including the\nenhancement of \u03c3I, the enhancement of two-neutron removal cross section \u03c3-2n and the narrow peak in the\nmomentum distribution of fragmentation 9Li. The discovery of these unusual phenomena evokes further theoretical\nand experimental research on proton halo and proton skin. New properties of these nuclei like the soft giant\nresonance, the change of magic number and new decay modes etc stimulate the research using RIB strongly.\nRIB research opens the new research area called isospin physics. Isospin dependence of collective flow,\nparticle and intermediate mass fragment (IMF) emission yield ratio and double yield ratio of isotopes etc in\nintermediate energy heavy ion reaction using different isospin reaction systems is closely related to equation of\nstate(EOS) of nucleus and nucleon-nucleon cross section in nuclear medium which are important for both nuclear\nphysics and astrophysics. RIB will help to synthesize new nuclides far from stability line and even super heavy\nelements. RIB also stimulates new research area called nuclear astrophysics strongly. The most important base of\nthese researches is the production of RIB with high intensity and good quality. In the past decades the isotope\nseparation on line (ISOL) and projectile fragmentation (PF) methods have proved to be the very efficient ways to\nproduce RIB. Recently a proposal which combines above two ways together suggest to built a new RIB machine\nwhich can give four different energy RIB at same time. With the development of RIB technology the radioactive ion\nbeam physics and nuclear astrophysics will obtain new development in near future.\nIn this paper, the new progresses of Radioactive Ion Beam Physics and Nuclear Astrophysics in China are\nreports, which focus on the following aspects: the nuclear structure and reaction for nuclear far from \u03b2-stability line,\nthe synthesize of new super heavy nuclides; Isospin dependence of High spin state and some systematic related\ntheoretical research.\nII. Halo and Skin Nuclei: Structure and Reaction\nSystematic measurements of \u03c3R's for some A<30 proton rich nuclei were performed on RIBLL of HIRFL at\nintermediate energies[8-10]. The \u03c3R was measured by a direct transmission method using a Si detector telescope,\nwhere the radioactive ion beams were produced through the projectile fragmentation induced by 69 MeV/nucleon\n36Ar primary beam. As shown in the isospin (N \u2212Z) dependences of \u03c3R for N = 8, 10, 12 isotones in Fig.1 (right),\n\n\fthe experimental \u03c3R of 23Al and 27P are anomalously larger than their isotones. The difference factor d is used in\norder to analyze the possibility of nucleon halo or nucleon skin in those nuclei quantitatively. Ozawa et al. [11] had\nsuccessfully applied the difference factor d to analysis the exotic structure in neutron-rich nuclei. The (N \u2212Z)\ndependence of d is also given in Fig. 1 (left). The d's of 17F, 23Al and 27P show a large enhancement compared to\ntheir neighboring nuclei.\n\nFig. 1 The (N-Z) dependences for the different factor d\nand \u03c3R for N = 8, 10, 12 isotones from the present\nexperiment at 30 MeV/u.\n\nFig. 2 RDDH calculated Density distributions of proton\n(dashed), neutron (dotted), matter (solid) and the last\nproton (dotted dashed) in 17F, 23Al, 27P and that of their\ncorresponding core nuclei. The experimental density\ndistribution deduced using Glauber model for 17F, 23Al\nand 27P are also plotted as shadow region.\n\nFor 27P, it was predicted [12-13] that there is a proton halo in 27P and the MSU experiment [14] confirmed it.\nTogether with the data of the separation energy of the last proton (Sp = 0.6 MeV) and of its ground state information\n(2s1/2), it is strongly suggested that there is a proton halo in 27P. The calculated result of relativistic densitydependent Hartree (RDDH) approach in Fig. 2 also shows there is a long tail in the proton density distribution. The\ntheoretical RMS radius of the last proton is 4.34 fm and it is evidently larger than the average RMS radius of other\nnuclei. For 23Al. the proton separation energy is Sp = 0.125 MeV. Although the spin and parity of the ground state in\n23\nAl is still unknown, it is known that there is a large prolate deformation in its neighboring nucleus 22Mg (\u03b22= 0.56).\nIt is reasonably assumed that the deformation in 23Al is close to that in 22Mg. It is very safely concluded that the\ndeformation in 23Al should be \u03b22 = 0.3~0.6. According to the deformed calculations by Bohr and Mottelson [15], it is\nreliably assumed that the ground state of 23Al is the 2s1/2 state. Therefore it is concluded that there is a proton halo in\n23\nAl. The RDDH calculation on the density distributions of 23Al (see Fig. 2) also supports a proton halo in 23Al. For\n17\nF, the proton separation energy is Sp = 0.6 MeV and its ground state is a spherical state 1d5/2. It may have a\nproton-skin structure which is also suggested by other experimental group based on various experimental results [16].\nFurther experiments are needed for proton-rich nuclei in this mass region in order to the elucidation the proton halo\nstructure in 23Al and 27P and the proton-skin structure in 17F.\nThe origin of the chemical elements in nature constitutes a fascinating problem of nuclear astrophysics. Stellar\nnucleosynthesis has become one of the most successful theories of element formation[17-18]. In the theory, it\nassumes that only hydrogen, helium, and the rare light isotopes with A<12 could be produced in the big bang. The\nnuclei heavier than iron can only be created by successive neutron capture reactions and beta decay. Along this\nsequence, the 11B(n, \u03b3)12B and 12C(n, \u03b3)13C are very important and therefore experimental studies of these reactions\nare strongly called for. However, the direct capture cross sections at stellar energies are very difficult to measure\nwith high precision. Recently, an indirect method was proposed to obtain the direct capture cross section at stellar\nenergy from the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the overlap wave function in peripheral transfer\nreaction[19]. The cross sections of the peripheral nucleon transfer at energies above the Coulomb barrier are several\n\n\forders of magnitude larger than that of direct capture. Hence their method should provide an easy and reliable way to\ndetermine the capture cross sections of astrophysical interest.\nThe experiment was carried out with a collimated deuteron beam from the HI-13 tandem accelerator at China\nInstitute of Atomic Energy, Beijing (CIAE). The differential cross sections of the transfer reactions 11B(d,p)12B and\n12\nC(d,p)13C were measured in the angular range of 5\u00b0< \u03b8Lab<140\u00b0 in 5\u00b0 steps. The measured angular distribution of\nthe transfer reactions 11B(d,p)12B is shown in Figs. 3 as solid points. Using a proper distorted-wave Born\napproximation (DWBA) code[20], the nuclear ANC's of the ground and excited states in 12B and 13C are derived\nfrom the transfer differential cross sections at very forward angles. It shows that the ANC value is insensitive to the\nparameters used in the binding potential. With these ANC's, we have calculated the rms radii, the probability D1 of\nthe last neutron outside the range of nuclear interaction, and the contribution, D2 of the asymptotic part to the rms\nradius. The results indicate that the second (J\u03c0=2-) and third (J\u03c0 =1-) excited states in 12B and the first (J\u03c0=1/2+)\nexcited state in 13C are the neutron halo states, whereas the third (J\u03c0=5/2+) excited state in 13C is a neutron skin\nstate[21]. The ANC method provides a natural way to relate the peripheral transfer reactions to the direct radiative\ncapture reactions. It is of astrophysical interest to deduce the direct neutron radiative capture cross sections of 11B\nand 12C from the measured ANC's. These stable nuclei can also be investigated without radioactive beams.\nTherefore more and more laboratories can study neutron halos even if they do not have a big machine for the\nproduction of radioactive beams. This may be important for future study.\n\nFIG. 3. Angular distributions for the transfer\nreactions 11B(d,p)12B at Ed=511.8 MeV. The\ndashed curves denote the normalized DWBA\ncalculations. The solid lines represent the\nresults combining the contributions of the\ndirect and the compound processes.\n\nFig. 4 The matter density distributions for nuclei 12B,\nC, 16N, and 17O where the last neutron is in the excited\nstate 2s1/2 with the force set SL3. The solid curve is for\nthe neutron density distribution, the dashed one for the\nproton density distribution, and the dotted one for the\nhalo neutron, occupying the excited 2s1/2 state.\n\n13\n\nBased on the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory, the newly discovered neutron halos in the excited states of\nnuclei 12B, 13C and 209Pb [21] are studied. Because these nuclei are spherical with a good inert core plus a valence\nneutron, the spherical RMF code is used to carry out numerical calculations[12,23]. Here two typical forces sets of\neffective forces NL-SH and NL3[24-25] are used for and it is expected that other forces will lead to very similar\nresults. The total energy, single particle energy, radii, wave-functions of each nucleon are obtained and the rms\nradius of the last neutron can be calculated by its wave function. The results show that the theoretical binding\nenergies for the ground state and the excited states are very close to the experimental data. It shows the RMF model\ncan be applied for the lowly excited states of odd-A nuclei with a core plus a valence neutron structure. It is seen\nclearly that the last neutron is tightly bound for the ground state and weakly bound for the excited state. Therefore\nthere are possibly the neutron skin for the ground state and the neutron halo for the excited state. The RMS radius of\nthe last neutron in the ground state of a nucleus is slightly larger than the matter RMS radius of the nucleus and its\ncore nucleus. But the RMS radius of the last neutron in the excite state is significantly larger than the RMS radius of\n\n\fthe nucleus and its core nucleus. This demonstrates the existences of neutron skin in the ground state and neutron\nhalo in the excited state. The self-consistent RMF calculated density distributions for nuclei 12B, 13C, 16N, and 17O\nwhere the last neutron is in the excited state s1/2 are plotted in Fig 4. It is seen that there is a long tail in the density\ndistribution of neutrons due to the weak binding of the last neutron. This clearly indicates that the neutron halo exist\nin the excited state of these nuclei. We suggest that the 16N and 17O can be chosen as the new candidates of neutron\nhalos in the excited state. The present experimental conditions in CIAE are suitable to observe the neutron halo in\nthese two nuclei.\n\nFig. 5 (a) Angular distributions of 1H (6He, 6Li)n reactions and the DWBA calculations by different\nnucleon density distributions. (b) Neutron and proton density distributions for the 3.563 MeV 0+\nstate of 6Li and the ground state of 6He used in the calculation.\nThe isobaric analog states (IAS) of the neutron halo nuclei should also have halo-like structure[26]. Arai et al.\n[27] studied 6He and of it is isobaric analog state (3.563 MeV 0+ state of 6Li) with a fully microscopic three-cluster\nmodel and predicted that the latter has a more conspicuous halo-like structure formed by the neutron and the proton\nsurrounding the core. Though the halo effect should appear in the region of large angles, the measurement of full\nangular distributions for the 1H(6He, 6Li)n reaction in reverse kinematics is necessary. The experiment was carried\nout using the secondary beam facility[27] of the HI-13 tandem accelerator at CIAE. The angular distributions are\nshown in Fig. 5(a). The filled circles are the differential cross sections of 3.563MeV 0+ state of 6Li. The\nconventional DWBA calculations of the 3.563 MeV 0+ state of 6Li with different nucleon density distributions are\nalso shown in Fig. 5(a). The experimental data can be well reproduced with the microscopic DWBA analysis if it is\nassumed that both the ground state of 6He and the secondary excited state of 6Li have halo structure with nucleon\ndensity distributions as shown in Fig. 5(b). It reveals the proton\u2013neutron halo structure of the secondary excited state\nof 6Li which is predicted by Arai et al. [26].\nIII. Synthesis of New Nuclides and Super Heavy Nuclides\nEarly attempts to discover isotopes of the element Db105 were made by Flerov in 1968 [28]. Up to now, a\nblank position for 259Db is still left among the known isotopes. Its decay properties are still completely unknown.\nIdentification and study the decay properties of 259Db nuclide will close this gap[29]. The reaction 241Am (22Ne, 4n)\nwas used to produce this new isotope 259Db, which is performed at the SFC (Sector Focus Cyclotron) of HIRFL. Its\nidentification was performed by recoil-milking the 21s 255Lr daughter. At the same time, its neighboring nuclide\n258\nDb has also been observed. The experimental set-up is shown schematically in Fig. 6(a).\nThe identification of this nuclide has been performed by measuring the alpha-particle emission of the mother\nand daughter nuclides. A complex group of peaks with the energies of 9.08, 9.17 and 9.30 MeV could be assigned to\n258\nDb based on the whole complex group decays with a measured half-life of 4.3s. This nuclide arose from the\nreaction 241Am (22Ne, 4n). According to Alice Code calculations, we expect that at E = 118 MeV the 5n cross-section\nis about a factor of two higher than the 4n cross-section. The half-lives of 4.3 s and 13.4 s deduced from the decay\ncurves of 259Db and 254Lr agree quite well with the known values for these isotopes. The production cross-sections\nestimated from the yields of 259Db and 258Db \u03b1-decays are 1.6\u00b11.2nb and 3.6\u00b11.8nb, respectively.\n\n\fThe \u03b1-decay energies Q\u03b1 of the heaviest elements as a function of neutron number N are plotted in fig. 6(b)[29].\nWe compared the \u03b1-decay energies of new isotope 259Db to the values of known isotopes in a \"Q\u03b1 -systematics\" for\nisotopes with Z \u2265 98. One can see that the deformed gap of N = 152 in the single-particle levels is still observed\nfrom elements 98 up to 105. It also shows that the Q\u03b1 value for new isotope 259Db, as compared with the trend for the\nother Z = 105 isotopes, fits quite well into the general trend. 259Db with neutron number N = 154 has a higher \u03b1decay energy than the other Z = 105 isotopes. Our Q\u03b1 value 9.62 MeV for the new isotope 259Db derived from the\nexperiment is in good agreement with the values of 9.60 and 9.61 MeV theoretically predicted, respectively.\n\nFig. 6 (a) Schematic diagram of the He-jet target chamber, capillary transport assembly, the rotating\nwheel collection and detection system. (b) The systematic of alpha-decay energy Q\u03b1 vs. neutron\nnumber N for isotopes with Z \u2265 98. The Q\u03b1 value for 259Db was derived from the present work.\nIV. Isospin Dependence of High Spin State\n\nFIG. 7 Comparison of the moments of inertia J(1) and J(2) of the collective band in 137Ce\nwith those of bands 1, 3, and 5 in 135Ce and negative parity collective bands in 136,138Ce.\nThe 137Ce nucleus exhibits transitional character as the neutron number is just below the neutron shell closure at\nN=82. For transitional nuclei in the N=135 region, the ground state shape changes rapidly with N. Study of the high\nspin states of 137Ce can provide valuable information for the nuclear structure, the systematical shape change, the\nquasi-particle configurations of certain single energy levels, and the deformation driving effects of the single particle\norbital. The results of in-beam spectroscopic studies of 137Ce[30-32] indicate that the yrast levels of 137Ce at low\nspins show a h11/222 decoupled band structure and the prolate-oblate shape transition may occur between N=77 and 79\n\n\fin Ce isotopes. However, no high K collective rotational band based on the multi-quasi-particle configuration was\nobserved in 137Ce. In order to obtain further information on the behavior of the Ce isotope, high spin states in the\nN=79 137Ce nucleus have been studied with the reaction 124Sn(18O,5n)137Ce at beam energy 78 MeV[33].\nThe level scheme has been expanded with spin up to 43/2 h . At low spins, the yrast collective structure built on\nthe \u03bdh11/2\u00d72+ multiplet shows a transitional shape with \u03b3=30.8\u00b0 according to calculations of the triaxial rotor-plusparticle model. The configurations for several high spin states have been discussed from a systematical comparison\nwith neighboring nuclei. A collective band built on I=33/2 level has been observed for the first time. The most\ninteresting finding of the present study is the collective rotational band built on the 5379.1 keV level. Based on a\nsystematical comparison with the neighboring nuclei 135,136,138Ce, we believe that this collective band should belong\nto a collective rotational oblate band built on a multi-quasi-particle configuration with \u03b3=-60\u00b0. The collective band\nobserved in 137Ce exhibit some distinct properties of the oblate bands in this region. Plots of the moments of inertia\nJ(1) and J(2) of the collective band in 137Ce along with bands 1, 3, and 5 in 135Ce and the negative parity bands in\n136,138\nCe against the rotational frequency h\u03c9 are shown in Fig. 7. Among them, bands 1 and 3 in 135Ce have a\nprolate shape (\u03b3=0\u00b0) and the other three bands in 135,136,138Ce have a oblate shape (\u03b3=-60\u00b0). The J(1) and J(2) of the\nband in 137Ce show a similar behavior to that in the oblate bands of the neighboring isotopes, but are different from\nthose in the prolate bands. Furthermore, the possible configuration for the oblate band in 137Ce can be deduced which\nis same as that in band 5 in 135Ce and consistent with that of the negative parity band in 136,138Ce.\nV. Theoretical Research and Calculation\n\nFIG. 8 (a) The two-neutron separation energies S2n in even Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn, and Pb isotopes are\nplotted against the neutron number N. Open symbols represent the values calculated from the\nRCHB theory with the NLSH parameter set while solid ones represent the data available. (b) The\nroot mean square neutron radius rn for even Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn and Pb isotopes from RCHB\ncalculation as a function of the neutron number N. The curve for the r0N1/3 rule with r0=1.139 fm\nhas been included to guide the eye.\nBased on the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory[34], the formation of a neutron halo\ncan be understood as the scattering of Cooper pairs into the continuum containing low-lying resonances of small\nangular momentum. Along this line a new phenomenon -giant neutron halos- has been predicted in the Zr nuclei\nclose to the neutron drip line[35]. They are formed by from two to six neutrons scattered as Cooper pairs mainly to\nthe levels 3p3/2, 2f7/2, 3p1/2, and 2f5/2. These procedures are applied in the O, Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn, and Pb isotopes, where\nthe RCHB equations is solved in a box with the size R=20 fm and a step size of 0.1 fm. The parameter set NL-SH is\nused, which aims at describing both the stable and exotic nuclei. The use of other parameters such as TM1 does not\nprovide very different results.\nThe two-neutron separation energy S2n is quite a sensitive quantity to test a microscopic theory. Both the\ntheoretical and the available experimental S2n for O, Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn, and Pb isotopes are presented in Fig. 8(a). The\ngood agreement between experiment and calculation is clearly shown. Along the S2n versus N curve for Ca isotopes,\nthree strong kinks appear at the magic or sub-magic numbers N=20, 28, and 40, respectively. However, there seems\nno kink at the other magic number N=50, which suggests the disappearance of the neutron magic number N=50.\nTherefore the nucleus 70Ca is no more a double-magic nucleus. This disappearance of the N=50 magic number at the\nneutron drip line is due to the halo property of the neutron density with the spherical shape being kept. All these\n\n\fsuggest that the single-particle level energies and their orders will vary violently in the near drip-line region. Then\nresult in the change of the traditional magic numbers. Another remarkable appearance in Fig. 1 is that the S2n values\nfor exotic Ca isotopes are extremely close to zero in several isotopes. If one regards 60Ca as a core, then the valence\nneutrons are filled in the weakly bound levels and continuum above the N=40 sub-shell for these nuclei, especially\nfor 66~72Ca. This is very similar to S2n in Zr isotopes with N>82[34]. It should be noted that the behavior of S2n\nindicates the appearance of a ''giant halo'' in Ca chains [35], just as that in Zr chains.\nTo illustrate the probable ''giant halo,'' the calculated neutron radii rn from the RCHB calculation for even-even\nnuclei in O, Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn, and Pb isotopes are plotted in Fig. 8(b). It is very interesting to see that rn follow the N1/3\nsystematic well for stable nuclei although their proton number is quite different. Near the drip line, abnormal\nbehaviors appear at N=40 in Ca isotopes and at N=82 in Zr isotopes. The increase of rn in exotic Ni and Sn nuclei is\nnot as fast as that in Ca and Zr. The nuclei at the abnormal rn increase correspond to those for S2n. They give further\nsupport for the formation of a giant halo. Compared with Zr isotopes, the giant halo in Ca isotopes will be easy to\naccess experimentally. Of course there are also some abnormal changes for the Ni and Sn isotopes near the neutron\ndrip line, but they are not as obvious as the Ca and Zr cases.\n\nFig. 9. Incident energy dependence of \u03c3R shown in the of p-shell nuclear chart. The experimental\ndata are indicated by various points[36]. Solid curves indicated the calculations by using the\nGlauber-model. Dashed curves indicated the BUU calculations by using soft EOS and 0.8 \u03c3Cug.\nA useful tool to study \u03c3R is the microscopic Glauber multiple-scattering theory. Comparisons of the \u03c3R at\nrelativistic energy with that at intermediate energies have been done by Ozawa et al.[11]. It indicates that the\nGlauber-model calculations always underestimate \u03c3R at intermediate energies. For more detail, the differences\nbetween the experimental data and the calculated values at intermediate energies vary from nucleus to nucleus in the\nsame isotope chain, particularly from nuclei near \u03b2-stability line to halo or skin nuclei. It has been pointed out that\nthe optical limit may not be a good approximation if one applies the model to halo nuclei at intermediate energy. In\norder to study this deviation between the experimental data and the calculated one, the Boltzmann-UehlingUhlenbeck (BUU) equation has been used to \u03c3R [36]. The \u03c3R's are calculated by using soft EOS and 0.8\u03c3Cug. For\nsimplicity, a square-type distribution for the density is used and the width of the square distribution was obtained by\nfitting the \u03c3R's at relativistic energies. As shown in Fig. 9, it is very clear that the BUU model reproduces the \u03c3R at\nintermediate energy much better than Glauber-model.\nThe systematical underestimation of \u03c3R by Glauber model was removed out now by the above BUU calculation\nframework. The isospin dependence of \u03c3R has been studied by deducing the difference factor d. From the isospin\ndependence of d for Li, Be, B and C isotopes, it can be seen that the d of BUU-model calculations is less than that of\n\n\fGlauber calculations systematically. For Glauber calculations, the d is about 20% for the nuclei near \u03b2-stability line\nand enhances up to 30~40% for some nuclei that have anomalous structure such as skin and halo. For BUU\ncalculations, the d is less than 10% and the d of halo or skin nuclei is still larger than that of their neighbors which is\nsame with the Glauber calculations. Thus it is suggested that the difference factor d is sensitive to the nuclei structure\nsuch as halo or skin.\n\nFig. 10 The energy dependence of \u03c3-2n of 11Li+12C. The open circles are\nexperimental data. The solid curve is the BUU calculation. The dotted curve\nis the Glauber calculation.\nFurthermore the above BUU model is used to study \u03c3R \u3001 \u03c3-n and \u03c3-2n simultaneously [37]. The density\ndistributions which come from RMF model with NLZ interaction have been introduced to replace the normal used\nsquare-type distributions. Then the BUU calculations, which with no adjustable parameter, can reproduce the\nexperimental \u03c3R\u3001\u03c3-n and \u03c3-2n very well for various reaction systems. Here \u03c3-n and \u03c3-2n have been calculated as the\ndifference between \u03c3R of halo nucleus and core nucleus, by assuming \u03c3 corr \u2248 0 . Fig.10 shows the energy\n\ndependence of \u03c3-2n of 11Li+12C reaction system. It can be seen that the BUU calculated \u03c3-2n decreases with the\nincrease of energy at both low and high energy range gently. It suggests that the assumption works well at high\nenergy. At intermediate energy, the calculated \u03c3-2n of Glauber calculation increases fast with the decrease of energy,\nwhere the BUU calculation gives slight increasing trend. Whatever the experimental data of \u03c3-2n at this energy range\nis rather rare. More experimental measurements are necessary to estimate the roles of different mechanisms\nsimultaneously and test the validity of the assumption at intermediate energy.\n\nFig. 11 (a) The proton\u2013neutron correlation function for different Be isotopes. The insert\nshows the relationship between the strength of proton\u2013neutron correlation function CPN\nat 5 MeV/c and the binding energy per nucleon of the projectile Eb. (b) The relationship\nbetween the proton\u2013halo-neutron correlation function CPH at 5 MeV/c and the singleneutron separation energy of the nuclei. The solid line is just a linear fit.\n\n\fHanbury Brown\u2013Twiss (HBT) technique was presented for the astrophysical measurements a few decades ago,\nand it reveals information about the angular diameters of distant stars. More recently, it has been widely used in\nothers fields since the emission time and source size in the nuclear reaction can be extracted by the nuclear HBT\ntechnique. It is very interesting to investigate the exotic nuclei via HBT technique further. The intensity HBT\ntechnique has been applied to investigate its sensitivity to the binding energy and separation energy of neutron-rich\nnuclei from the break-up of nuclei by convoluting the phase-space distribution generated with the IDQMD model.\nFirstly we gave a well-fitted halo-neutron\u2013halo-neutron correlation function from the break-up of 14Be on C target.\nBased upon this achievement of the good fit, we explore the dependence of the proton\u2013neutron correlation function\n(CPN) at small relative momentum with the binding energy (Ebin) for Be isotopes. It was found that the correlation\nstrength of CPN at small relative momentum rises with Ebin. This changeable tendency of CPN with Ebin is reported for\nthe first time and it might be a potential good way to study the structure of the nuclei. Moreover, the proton\u2013halo\nneutron correlation function (CPH) is also constructed from the break-up reactions. There exists the similar\nrelationship between the CPH at small relative momentum and the separation energy (Esep) of Be isotopes as the\nrelationship of CPN to Ebin. From theoretical point of view, CPH at small relative momentum is sensitive to Esep and\nthis can be attributed to the spatial extension level of the neutron which is most far away the center of the nucleus.\nThe behavior of the correlation functions between the proton and the neutron as a function of neutron number\nand binding energy is shown in Fig. 11(a). Generally the strength of HBT at very small relative momentum shows a\nclear dependence on the neutron number. The tendency of the CPN rises with the increasing Eb. Among the\nprojectiles we studied, the number of the protons is 4 and that of the neutron are gradually increasing, and this will\nreflect the stability of the nuclei. With the increasing of the mass number, the mean relationship between the\nnucleons will change weaker. Since the strength CPN of correlation function symbolizes the mean relationship\nbetween the emitted proton and neutron and the binding energy per nucleon associated with the tightness between the\nnucleon, the tendency shown in the insert of Fig. 11(a) reflects that the CPN can reveal the compactness of the nuclei.\nOn the other hand, we also study the correlation functions between the proton and the most outside neutron. Here the\nmost outside neutron is defined as the one which is the most far away from the spatial center at the FSI and it is also\ncalled as a halo neutron for simplification, even though it is not strict in physics sense. To obtain reasonable HBT\nresults for halo neutron and proton, only those events in which the halo neutron and proton are emitted in the same\nevent are accepted to investigate such a correlation function. The similar correlation function was obtained as CPN\nand the relationship between the strength of proton\u2013 halo-neutron correlation function CPH at 5MeV/c and the singleneutron separation energy of the projectile Esep was extracted. The symbols of Fig. 11(b) show the calculated result.\nIt looks that, with the increasing of the Esep, CPH at 5 MeV/c rises gradually. Since the strength CPH of correlation\nfunction between neutron and proton increases with the decreasing of the source size, the above Esep dependence of\nCPH reflects that the emission source size of the neutron and proton shrinks with the separation energy of the single\nneutron, which is consistent with the extent of binding of single neutron via Esep.\nVI. Conclusion\nBased on RIBLL of HIRFL and Low Energy GIRAFFE of HI13, the radioactive ion beam physics and nuclear\nastrophysics will be researched in detail.
