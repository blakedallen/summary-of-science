By extending the factors influencing the ordering, we investigate the case when the movement of the self-propelled particles (SPP-s) depends on both the velocity and the acceleration of the\nneighboring particles, instead of being determined solely by the former one. By changing the value\nof a weight parameter s determining the relative influence of the velocity and the acceleration terms,\nthe system undergoes a kinetic phase transition as a function of a behavioral pattern. Below a critical\nvalue of s the system exhibits disordered motion, while above it the dynamics resembles that of the\nSPP model. We argue that in nature evolutionary processes can drive the strategy variable s towards\nthe critical point, where information exchange between the units of a system is maximal.\n\n1\n\nInroduction\n\nCollective motion of organisms (e.g. fish schools, bird flocks, bacterial colonies) exhibits a large variety\nof emergent phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Synchronized motion, symmetrical group formations\n(e.g., V shaped) or swirling patterns emerge in spite of the apparently simple behavioral rules of the\nindividual flock members [9, 10]. The self propelled particles (SPP) model was proposed by Vicsek et\nal. [11] to describe the onset of ordered motion within a group of self-propelled particles in the presence\nof perturbations. Taking into the effects of fluctuations inevitably present in biological systems was an\nessential generalization of the prior deterministic flocking models such as that of Reynolds [12]. The\noriginal model considers point-like particles moving at constant velocity on a two dimensional surface\nwith periodic boundary conditions. The only rule is that, at each time step, every particle approximates,\nwith some uncertainty, the average direction of motion of the particles within its neighborhood of radius\nR. This model exhibits spontaneous self-organization; by decreasing the noise parameter, the system\nundergoes a kinetic phase transition from a disordered state to an ordered one where all the particles move\napproximately in the same direction. Due its simplicity and analogy with biological systems comprised\nof many, locally interacting particles, the SPP model soon became a reference model for the flocking\nbehavior of organisms [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].\nThe individual based behavioral rules, determining collective motion, are of particular interest. Important elements of behavioral rules are the nature of the perceived information and the affected behavioral traits. [24, 25, 26]. A frequent assumption in models is that the information, perceived by the\nparticles, is restricted to the velocity of their neighbors. The interaction range is usually defined by metric distances, but Ballerini et al. [24] recently showed that topological distance is the one determining the\nflocking of starlings. The assumption of reflecting on the momentary velocity only may not be enough\nfor adequately describing a number of biologically relevant situations. We expect that the behavior of\n1\n\n\fthe SPP model is significantly extended if we also incorporate a term corresponding to memory on short\ntime scales. This can be achieved by introducing an acceleration term into the equations (rules). This\nis equivalent to separating time scales by assuming that the particles differentiate between two kind of\ninformation, the first being their actual velocity, the second one corresponding to recent change in their\ndirection of motion. For example, in the case of birds, reacting to acceleration may mean that birds can\ngive signals to their neigbors about their intended changing of their flight direction by quickly modifying\ntheir velocity.\n\n2\n\nModel\n\nIn the three-dimensional, scalar noise (SNM) version [27] of the original SPP model [11] the particles are\nassumed to move with a constant velocity \u03bd, and their positions are updated simultaneously according to\nxi (t + \u2206t) = xi (t) + vi (t)\u2206t,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere xi and vi are position and velocity of particle i, respectively. The time increment is set to be\n\u2206t = 1. Each particle is assumed to move, with some uncertainty, in the average direction of all the\nparticles within a fixed neighborhood of radius R = 1. Hence, the new velocity is given by\nvi (t + \u2206t) = \u03bd * M(e, \u03be) * N (hv(t)ii,R ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nvi (t + \u2206t) = \u03bd * M(e, \u03be) * N (s * hv(t)ii,R + (1 \u2212 s) * ha(t)\u2206tii,R ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the absolute value of velocity, M(e, \u03be) is a rotational tensor representing a random perturbation, hv(t)ii,R denotes the average velocity of all particles around particle i within radius R including\nparticle i itself, and N(u) = u/|u|. M(e, \u03be) performs a rotation of angle \u03be around a vector e; \u03be is a\nuniform random value in the interval [\u2212\u03b7\u03c0, \u03b7\u03c0], whereas e is a random unit vector chosen uniformly\nfrom the set of vectors perpendicular to N (hv(t)ii,R ). The order in which (1) and (2) are calculated has\nsome quantitative effects on the results (see later).\nHere we introduce the acceleration coupled self-propelled particles model (AC-SPP) being a modified version of SNM, in which the velocity vector vi (t + \u2206t) is a function of both the velocity v(t) and\nthe acceleration a(t) = (v(t) \u2212 v(t \u2212 \u2206t))/\u2206t of the neighboring particles. Then equation 2 becomes\nwhere s \u2208 (0, 1] is a so-called strategy parameter, expressing the relative influence of the acceleration and\nvelocity tags on the velocity vector of the focal particle. Initially, we have N = \u03c1L3 randomly distributed\nparticles, where L and \u03c1 stand for box size and particle number density, respectively. The bounding\nbox has periodic boundary conditions. The velocity parameter used in the simulations is \u03bd = 0.1,\ncorresponding to the low velocity regime [21].\nTaking into account the acceleration in a separate term has various possible motivations. As for the\ncontribution of the i-th particle, it corresponds to a memory effect: a given particle, if it has no neighbors,\nhas a tendency to keep on turning as it did in the previous time step. Perhaps more importantly, the average turning rate of the neighbors has now a separated effect on the turning rate of the i-th particle. In the\ns close to 1 limit the AC-SPP model is very much like the original SPP, while for s \u001c 1 the acceleration\nterm dominates and instantaneous turning of the neighbors has a strong effect on the trajectory of the i-th\nparticle. In this way not only the state (velocity), but a kind of behavioral pattern (turning) can be taken\ninto account. We associate, for example, with such a behavioral pattern a short turning period of a bird\nflying in a flock and giving sign for its neighbors of its intended changing of the direction of flight.\nWe characterize the collective motion of particles by the average velocity of all particles \u03c6, defined\nas\nN\n1 X\n\u03c6=\nvi ,\nN\ni=1\n\n2\n\n\fwith N denoting the number of particles in the system. This order parameter can take any value in the\nrange [0, 1], and expresses the tendency of particles to move in the same direction. If the particles move\nrandomly \u03c6 = 0 whereas if every particle moves in the same direction \u03c6 = 1. h\u03c6i was obtained by\naveraging over 12 individuals runs, each recorded after a relaxation time to stationarity Trelax and with\ntime averaging over an additional Tavr time steps.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nAt first we investigated the dynamics of the system at different values of the strategy variable s at fixed\ndensity and noise values: \u03c1 = 0.16, \u03b7 = 1/9. The density was choosen to be high enough to get flocking,\nbut allowing moderate CPU times per run. The noise value was a typical value resulting in an ordered\nstate for the original SPP model (s = 1). We found that by increasing s the system undergoes a phase\ntransition; below a critical value, sc , the ordering, expressed by \u03c6, is negligible, while above sc the level\nof order increases rapidly as a function of s (Figure 1). This is a novel type of phase transition since it\ncorresponds to a phase change due to a change in the relative strength of a behavioral pattern.\n1\n0.8\n\nh\u03c6i\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\ns\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Average velocity \u03c6 as a function of the strategy variable s. The data points were obtained\nby averaging the results of 12 simulations, using the parameters L = 100, \u03c1 = 0.16, \u03bd = 1/9, with a\nrelaxation time of Trelax = 10000 time steps and averaging over an additional Tavr = 10000 time steps.\nIn order to determine the nature of the phase transition we also calculated the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of \u03c6 and the Binder cumulant G at different strategy values. The Binder cumulant,\ndefined as G = 1 \u2212 h\u03c64 i/3h\u03c62 i2 , measures the fluctuations of the order parameter and can be used to\ndistinguish between first- and second order phase transitions [31]. In case of a first order phase transition\nG exhibits a characteristic minimum, whereas in case of a second order transition this sharp minimum\nis absent. In our case, the PDF was unimodal, and G did not have a sharp minimum around sc , both\nindicating a second order phase transition (Figures 2 and 3). G was monotonously increasing, as it was\nobserved already in a three dimensional SNM with continuous phase transition [27].\nConsequently, near the critical point, the order parameter obeys the scaling relation\n\u03c6 \u223c [s \u2212 sc (\u03c1, \u03b7)]\u03b2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the critical exponent. The critical values sc and \u03b2 were determined by plotting logh\u03c6i as\na function of log[(s \u2212 sc )/sc ] (Figure 4). sc was obtained by finding the value where the plot was the\n3\n\n\fs = 0.5750\ns = 0.5800\ns = 0.5850\ns = 0.5900\ns = 0.5950\ns = 0.6000\ns = 0.6100\n\n0.02\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0004\n\n0.015\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0002\n\n0.01\n\u0001\n\n0.005\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c6\nFigure 2: Probability density function (PDF) of the order parameter \u03c6.

It should be noted, that the value \u03b2 = 0.35 is far from\n0.5 (corresponding to mean-field or bifurcation) indicating the true non-trivial nature of the transition we\ndescribe.\n\nh\u03c6i\n\n1\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n(s \u2212 sc )/sc\nFigure 4: Average velocity values as a function of the distance from the critical point. The fitted line,\nwith sc = 0.590 \u00b1 0.002, had a slope of \u03b2 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.05. Parameters as in the previous plots.\nThe critical value of the transition depends on both the density and the noise parameters. Figure 5\nshows that sc is decreasing with both increasing density and noise values.\nThe order variable \u03c6, by itself, provides a poor description of the two states, hence we also calculated\nother statistics. The sinuosity of the particle trajectories was expressed by their average curvature, defined\nP\ni|\nas \u03bb = N1 N |v|vi \u00d7a\n3 . Two other statistics, \u03c8 and \u03bc, measure the information exchange between the\ni|\nparticles. \u03c8 is defined as the average number of different particles encountered, i.e., being within a\ndistance R, by a focal particle during a given time interval. Although this quantity depends on the\nchosen time interval, its monotonicity as a function of s is independent of it. \u03bc was used to evaluate the\nspeed of information propagation, as follows. Initially one percent of the particles held the information.\nThe information was transmitted between particles via encounters between information holders and other\nparticles. This way sooner or later every particle became information holder. \u03bc was defined as the time\nneeded for at least 90 percent of the particles becoming information holders.\nAll the three statistics h\u03bbi, h\u03c8i and h\u03bci were obtained by averaging over 12 individual runs, each\nwith a relaxation time of Trelax = 10000 and averaging time of Tavr = 10000. h\u03c8i is an average value\nfor 100 randomly chosen particles.\nThe curvature of the trajectories decreases with the strategy variable (Figure 6). Large curvature at\nlow s values indicates in this case, that particles move in small circles (Figure 7). It is because the large\ninfluence of the acceleration term results in continuous turning. This turning is synchronized among\nneighbors, i.e., their acceleration and velocity vectors become the same, resulting in a particle cloud\nconsisting of separated groups of particles, each containing circling particles. By increasing s the radius\nof these circles increases, until the circling groups overlap and start to interact with each other. At a\ncritical point the circles overlap so much, that neither their position, nor their composition remains the\nsame; in other words the circling groups lose their identity and the particles start to move sinuously. At\nlarge s values the movement becomes ordered; all particles tend to move in the same direction, similar\nto the ordered phase of the SNM model at small velocities.\nThe dynamics of the system is well reflected in the information propagation (Figure 8).

Compared to the OVA in case of the SVA the critical\nstrategy value is at lower s, but the behavior of the \u03c6, G and \u03bb functions are very similar. The information\nexchange between particles has its maximum value near the critical point as well, however, its variability\nas a function of s is much stronger than for OVA. Parameters as in Figure 1.\nIn the original SPP model [11] (here, following the notation of Huepe and Aldana, Ref [22], called\nas the Original Vicsek Algorithm (OVA)) the positions of the particles at t + \u2206t are depending on\ntwo previous time-steps, t and t \u2212 \u2206t. In the literature some authors have implemented the model in\na slightly different way [20, 28, 29, 30], where the order of the position and the velocity update are\nchanged. Huepe and Aldana [22] refer to this as the Standard Vicsek Algorithm (SVA) and they report\nthat the local density is different in the OVA and the SVA, while in both cases the average number of\ninteracting neighbors is unreasonably high because of the lack of a repulsive effect. By analysing the\nAC-SPP model with SVA-like updating rule (Figure 9), we find that the behavior of the order parameter,\nthe Binder cumulant and the average curvature are very similar to those in the OVA, but the critical s\nvalue is lower. The information exchange rate is, however, rather different and the maximum value of \u03c8\nis much higher in case of the SVA. The maximum value of the information exchange compared to the\nOV A /\u03c8 OV A = 1.4, while in case of the SVA \u03c8 SV A /\u03c8 SV A = 10.1.\nvalue at s = 1 in case of the OVA is \u03c8max\nmax\ns=1\ns=1\nAt s = 1, where the AC-SPP is congruous to the original SPP model, the rate of information exchange\nis similar in the OVA and the SVA.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, we investigated the statistical properties of a three-dimensional self-driven particle system\n(AC-SPP), designed to be an improved model for the collective motion of living beings and possibly\nnonliving units (robots). The ordering of particles exhibited a second-order phase transition as a function\nof the control parameter corresponding to a behavioral strategy in our case.\nWe found that the information exchange between particles was maximal at the critical point. Due\nto the important role of information exchange in animal societies, this might indicate that the critical\n8\n\n\fpoint corresponds to an optimal behavioral strategy. In a more general context, this result implies that\nbiological evolution may drive individual traits corresponding to critical values. However, because of the\nindividual based optimality requirement, this possibility needs to be investigated within an evolutionary\ngame theoretical framework.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
