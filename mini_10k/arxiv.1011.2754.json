A. Proite, Z. J. Simmons, and D. D. Yavuz\n\narXiv:1011.2754v1 [physics.atom-ph] 11 Nov 2010\n\nDepartment of Physics\nUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison,\n1150 University Ave. Madison, WI 53706, USA\n(Dated: November 2, 2018)\nWe present a proof-of-principle experiment in which the population of an atomic level is spatially\nlocalized using the technique of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). The key idea is to\nutilize the sensitive dependence of the dark state of EIT on the intensity of the coupling laser beam.\nBy using a sinusoidal intensity variation (standing-wave), we demonstrate that the population of a\nspecific hyperfine level can be localized much tighter than the spatial period.\n\nIt is well-known that traditional optical techniques\ncannot resolve or write features smaller than half the\nwavelength of light. This barrier, known as the diffraction limit, has important implications for a variety of\nscientific research areas including biological microscopy\nand quantum computation. As an example, in a neutralatom quantum computing architecture, the diffraction\nlimit prohibits high-fidelity manipulation of individual\natoms if they are separated by less than the wavelength\nof light. Recently, Agarwal and others [1\u20133] have proposed to use the dark state of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [4, 5] to address atoms at potentially nanometer spatial scales. This technique relies\non the sensitive dependence of the dark state to the intensities of the driving probe and coupling laser beams. If\na standing-wave coupling laser is used, the population of\nthe excited Raman level can be very tightly localized near\nthe intensity nodes, allowing for sub-wavelength control.\nIn this letter, we present a proof-of-principle experiment\nthat demonstrates the key ideas of this approach. By using ultracold Rubidium (Rb) atoms in a magneto-optical\ntrap (MOT) and pulsed coherent transfer, we demonstrate atomic localization to spots much smaller than the\nspatial period of the coupling-laser intensity profile. Although due to imaging limitations we have used a large\nspatial period in this work (\u2248 600 \u03bcm), our results will\nlikely scale to the sub-wavelength regime in the future.\nBefore proceeding, we cite important prior work leading up to this experiment. In their pioneering work,\nThomas and colleagues have suggested and experimentally demonstrated sub-wavelength position localization\nof atoms using spatially varying energy shifts [6\u20138].\nZubairy and coworkers have discussed atom localization\nusing resonance fluorescence and phase and amplitude\ncontrol of the absorption spectrum [9\u201311]. Knight and\ncolleagues discussed localization via quantum interference at the probability amplitude of the excited electronic state [12]. Li et. al. have experimentally demonstrated probe narrowing beyond the diffraction limit using a spatially-varying coupling laser profile in a vapor\ncell [13]. There has also been remarkable progress in\nutilizing the position dependent stimulated emission to\nachieve nanoscale resolution [14, 15]. This last approach,\n\nalso known as stimulated-emission depletion microscopy,\nis now a widely used technique in biological imaging.\nWe note that our approach of using the dark state for\natomic localization has the following key advantages: 1)\nFor the ideal case of sufficiently slowly varying driving\nlaser pulses, the dark-state technique has no population\nat the excited electronic state. As a result, the atomic\nlocalization can, in principle, be achieved without suffering from the detrimental effects of spontaneous emission.\nThis is especially important for quantum computing applications [2] where coherent manipulation with little decoherence is essential. 2) The dark state can be prepared\nadiabatically by using a counter-intuitive pulse sequence.\nAs a result, as discussed in detail in Ref. [3], the scheme\nis insensitive to many experimental fluctuations such as\nthe intensity and the timing jitter of the driving laser\npulses. 3) Since the scheme is coherent, localization can\nbe achieved at faster time-scales at the expense of requiring more intense laser beams. Although in this work we\nuse \u2248 100 ns-long laser pulses, dark-state-based localization can easily be achieved at sub-ns time-scales by using\nmore powerful laser beams.\nWe next discuss the details of our experiment which\ncan be viewed as a proof-of-principle demonstration of\nthe suggestion by Lukin and colleagues [2]. The experiment is performed inside a 14-port, stainless-steel ultrahigh vacuum chamber which is kept at a base pressure of about 10\u22129 torr. To construct the 87 Rb MOT,\nwe use three counter-propagating beam pairs that are\nlocked to the cycling transition, each with a beam power\nof 100 mW and a beam size of 3 cm. The MOT lasers\nare obtained from an external cavity diode laser whose\noutput is amplified with a tapered amplifier. We typically trap about 1 billion 87 Rb atoms at a temperature of 150 \u03bcK. The EIT beams are derived from a separate master diode laser which is saturated-absorption\nlocked to the appropriate transition. The coupling laser\nbeam is shifted by 6.8 GHz using high-frequency acoustooptic modulators and is amplified with a tapered amplifier [16]. As shown in Fig. 1, the probe and the coupling lasers are resonant with |F = 1i \u2192|F 0 = 2i and\n| F = 2i \u2192| F 0 = 2i transitions of the D2 line, near a\nwavelength of 780 nm.

The experiment is performed in a magneto-optical trap\n(MOT) of ultracold 87 Rb atoms. With atoms starting in the\n|F = 1i hyperfine level, we drive the atoms to the dark state\nwith a probe laser beam and a spatially-varying coupling laser\nbeam. The spatial profile for the coupling laser is obtained by\ncombining two identical beams at the MOT at an angle of 3\nmilliradians producing a vertical standing wave. The atomic\nlocalization is measured by taking fluorescence images with\nthe CCD. (b) The relevant energy level diagram, with probe\nlaser EP and coupling laser EC . The experiment works with\nthree parallel mF channels. (c) Transmission of a weak probe\nbeam (\u2248 100 nW power) through the cloud as a function\nof frequency with (solid blue line) and without (dashed red\nline) the coupling laser beam. We perform this measurement\nwith Coupling Beam 1 at an intensity of 120 mW/cm2 and do\nnot use the standing-wave. The on-resonance transmission is\nabout 70% demonstrating reasonably good EIT.\n\npolarization and the experiment works in three parallel\nmF channels [17]. The coupling laser is split into two\nbeams, which then reconverge at the MOT at an angle\nof 3 milliradians to form a vertical standing wave with a\nspatial period of \u039b = 600 \u03bcm. We probe the localization\nby level-dependent fluorescence of the atomic cloud. The\nfluorescence signal is collected with a 2-inch achromaticdoublet outside of the vacuum chamber and is recorded\nwith an electron-multiplying CCD camera.\nBefore proceeding further, we present a brief discussion\nof population localization using the dark state. Atoms\ndistributed throughout the MOT will see different coupling laser intensities, based on where they are in the\nstanding wave. Ignoring the complications due to parallel channels, the dark state of the atoms is given by\n[2\u20134]:\n| dark(x)i =\n\n\u03a9C (x) |F = 1i \u2212 \u03a9P |F = 2i\np\n,\n\u03a9C (x)2 + \u03a92P\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a9P and \u03a9C are the Rabi frequencies of the respective beams. Here, for simplicity, we assume the probe\nbeam to be uniform. The atoms can be prepared in the\ndark state of Eq. (1) by using the well-known counterintuitive pulse sequence with coupling laser turning on\nbefore the probe laser beam. Once the laser beams are\nturned on, they can be turned-off simultaneously preserving the ratio of the Rabi frequencies [3]. As a result,\neven after the laser pulses are turned-off, the atomic system is left in the state as determined by the probe and\ncoupling laser Rabi frequencies at the temporal-peak of\nthe pulses. Through this preparation, atoms will popu2\nlate |F\n\u0002 = 2i2 with2 a\u0003 probability of |hF = 2|dark(x)i| =\n2\n\u03a9P / \u03a9C (x) + \u03a9P . Due to the sensitive dependence\nto the coupling beam intensity, atoms located near a\ncoupling field zero-crossing (intensity node) coherently\ntransfer to |F = 2i with high probability. If we assume\nthat \u03a9C (x) is linear near a zero-crossing, then we expect\nthe probability |hF = 2|dark(x)i|2 to be maximum at the\ncoupling intensity node, and have an approximate spatial\nwidth of \u223c\u039b * \u03a9P /\u03a9C0 where \u03a9C0 is the peak coupling\nlaser Rabi frequency [2, 3]. As a result, with the probe\nlaser intensity fixed, the population of level |F = 2i becomes more and more localized with increasing coupling\nbeam power.\nThe experimental timing cycle is shown in Fig. 2. We\nbegin the experiment by loading the MOT for one second and then turn off the MOT magnetic field gradient\n50 ms prior to the EIT beams to reduce Zeeman splitting\nof the magnetic sublevels. All atoms are then initialized\nto |F = 1i by turning off the hyperfine repumping laser\nfor the MOT. We drive the atoms to the dark state by using a 400 ns-long coupling laser and a 250 ns-long probe\nlaser beam. After the EIT beams are turned-off, we probe\nthe population of |F = 2i by fluorescing the atoms for\n40 \u03bcs via the cycling transition (|F = 2i \u2192|F 0 = 3i).\nDue to sufficiently low atomic temperature, the motion\nof the atoms during fluorescence is negligible. In Fig. 2\nwe present two fluorescence images that show localization\nof the |F = 2i population as the coupling laser intensity\nis increased. Fig. 2(a) illustrates a case where we use a\nrelatively weak coupling beam, where IC0 ' 22 \u00d7 IP (IC0\nis the peak coupling intensity and IP is the probe intensity). The fringes align with the nodes of the coupling\nbeam intensity and have wide profiles in the vertical dimension. In Fig. 2(b), we use a nearly 20 times more\nintense coupling laser beam such that IC0 ' 418 \u00d7 IP .\nWe observe the fringes to be vertically much more tightly\nconfined to the coupling beam nodes. Both pictures use\na probe intensity of 3.9 mW/cm2 , and each picture is\nan average of 100 shots. Fig. 2(c) shows horizontallyaveraged line profiles of each fluorescence image for more\ndirect comparison.\nFigure 3 shows the normalized full-width-halfmaximum (FWHM) of the fringes as the coupling beam\nintensity is varied for two values of probe laser intensity IP = 3.9 mW/cm2 and IP = 15.6 mW/cm2 .

For\nIP = 3.9 mW/cm2 , we observe the population of level\n|F = 2i to localize by about a factor of two as the coupling beam intensity is increased. The solid lines in Fig. 3\nare the results of numerical calculations without any adjustable parameters (i. e. each parameter that goes into\nthe simulations are experimentally measured). Here, we\ninclude all relevant magnetic sub-levels and numerically\nsolve the time-domain density matrix equations for the\nconditions of our experiment. We have experimentally\nmeasured the standing-wave interference of the coupling\nlaser beam to be slightly imperfect with intensity contrast of 98%. This imperfection is included in our numerical calculations. The disagreement between theory\nand experiment is likely a result of 1) mechanical and interferometric fluctuations of the standing-wave intensity\nprofile of the coupling laser beam, and 2) the Zeeman\nshift of the magnetic-sublevels due to a residual background magnetic field.\nWe next discuss the coherent nature of population localization. The insets in Fig. 3 show the integrated probe\ntransmission through the atomic cloud as the coupling\nbeam intensity is increased. We see better probe transmission with increased coupling beam intensity, demonstrating EIT for the exact conditions of each localization\nexperiment. Furthermore, we have the ability to probe\nexcited state fluorescence during the EIT process by collecting scattered photons for the duration of the coupling\nlaser beam. We observe a reduction in the excited state\nfluorescence as the coupling laser intensity is increased,\ncomplementing the probe transmission data of the in-\n\nwidth (normalized)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2.

The population of | F = 2i becomes\nmore tightly localized to the standing wave nodes with increasing coupling laser beam intensity. The data points are\nexperimental observations and the solid lines are the result\nof a numerical simulation. We attribute the discrepancy between experiment and theory to various imperfections such as\nthe mechanical jitter of the standing-wave pattern. See text\nfor details. The insets show the integrated probe transmission\nthrough the cloud as the intensity of the coupling beam is increased. We observe increased transmission with increasing\ncoupling intensity, demonstrating the presence EIT.\n\nsets of Fig. 3. We also observe a strong increase in the\nexcited state fluorescence when the coupling laser beam\nis turned-off (probe laser propagating alone through the\ncloud). This further confirms that the atoms are driven\nto a dark state with a small population at the excited\nelectronic level.\nTo further test the coherent nature of the population\ntransfer, we have also performed a stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) experiment [18]. We measure the population transfer to |F = 2i at the intensity\npeaks of the coupling laser using a pulse sequence similar\nto above, but by changing the relative temporal overlap\nbetween the EIT beams.

Near the intensity nodes of the coupling laser, we observe approximately 10% increase in\npopulation transfer when the pulses overlap (not shown\nin Fig. 4). As mentioned earlier, there is a coupling beam\nintensity offset of 2% of the peak at the nodes due to\nan imperfect interference profile. To increase contrast,\nthe STIRAP experiments of Fig. 4 use beams that are\n12 MHz detuned to the blue of the excited state. The intensities of the two beams are IC0 \u2248 IP = 130 mW/cm2 .\nTo summarize, we have demonstrated localization of\nlevel population using EIT. As mentioned before, because our imaging system cannot resolve sub-wavelength\nspatial scales, we have performed this experiment with\na small-angle between the two coupling-laser beams and\ntherefore with a large spatial period of the standing-wave\ninterference pattern. Future work will include extending\nthis technique to the sub-wavelength regime and possibly\ndemonstrate nanometer scale localization and addressing\nof neutral atoms. Furthermore, by using more powerful laser beams, we aim to explore atomic localization\nat much faster time-scales. If successful, the ability to\naddress atoms at sub-ns time-scales with sub-wavelength\nresolution may provide a powerful tool for many challenging problems including initialization and addressability of\na neutral-atom quantum register [19, 20].\nWe thank J.
