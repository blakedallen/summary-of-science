The most interesting and stubborn case of\nmetastable state is one described by time dependent potential, which fluctuates on a characteristic time scale\nthat may vary over a large range. In particular, the\nmetastable states with fluctuating barriers are common\nto chemical and biological models [3, 4, 5], and to a wide\nrange of physical problems, such as nonequilibrium transport models, molecular dissociation in strongly coupled\nchemical systems [6], ratchet models for the action of\nmolecular motors [7], noise in microstructures and generation process of carrier traps in semiconductors [8, 9, 10].\nThe escape from metastable state with fluctuating or randomly switching barrier was studied in the past mainly\nby well known mean first passage time (MFPT) technique. In Refs. [11, 12] exact results for the MFPT of\nescape process over fluctuating barrier that switches between two configurations have been obtained. However,\nthe MFPT method requires the implication of absorbing\nboundary in the system, and it does not take into account\nthe inverse probability current through this boundary.\nThe nonlinear relaxation time (NLRT) method is devoid\nof this disadvantage [13]. Nevertheless the theory for the\nNLRT is not well developed and the equations for the\nNLRT are unknown for the case of time varying potential.\nIn the present paper we derive general equations for\nthe NLRT for potentials randomly switching between two\narbitrary configurations with a sink. We find the exact\nsolution of these equations for a piece-wise linear potential flipping between unstable and metastable configurations, for arbitrary white noise intensity and fluctuation rate of the potential. Analyzing this exact result\n\nwe focus on the noise enhanced stability (NES) effect,\nwhich implies that the system remains in the metastable\nstate for a longer time than in the absence of additive\nwhite noise, and the lifetime of the metastable state\nhas a maximum at some noise intensity. This effect,\nwhich cannot be described by Kramers-like behavior, was\nobserved and investigated theoretically and experimentally in various physical systems and mainly concerning\nMFPT in periodically or randomly driven metastable\nstates [3, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\nIn these papers the nonmonotonic behavior of the average escape time was observed: (i) in physical systems,\nlike tunnel diode [14], and Josephson junction [18], where\nthe influence of thermal fluctuations on the superconductive state lifetime and the turn-on delay time for a single\nJosephson element with high damping was investigated;\n(ii) in chemical systems, like the one-dimensional return\nmap of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, by investigating the behavior of the lenght of the laminar region\nas a function of the noise intensity [22], and (iii) in biologically motivated models, such that investigated in ref\n[3], where the overdamped motion of a Brownian particle moving in an asymmetric fluctuating potential shows\nnoise induced stability.\nHere we study the NES phenomenon for the NLRT\nin randomly switching metastable state, and we obtain\nanalytically the region of system parameters, where this\neffect takes place. We find also resonant activation phenomenon by investigating the mean lifetime as a function of switchings mean rate. Moreover, we find that\nthe NLRT exhibits a maximum as a function of barrier\nswitching rate. This new resonant-like phenomenon is\nrelated to the NES effect [9, 14].\nThe paper is organised as follows. In the second section\nwe derive the general equations for the nonlinear relaxation time of Brownian diffusion in randomly switching\npotential with a metastable state. In the third section we\nanalytically derive the mean lifetime for piece-wise linear\n\n\f2\npotential. In the next section we obtain the condition to\nobserve the NES phenomenon and investigate the behavior of the mean life time as a function of switchings mean\nrate. In the final section we draw the conclusions.\nII.\n\nGENERAL EQUATIONS\n\nWe consider the one-dimensional overdamped Brownian motion in switching potential profile\ndx\n\u2202\u03a6 (x, t)\n=\u2212\n+ \u03be (t) ,\ndt\n\u2202x\n\u03a6 (x, t) = U (x) + V (x) \u03b7 (t) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere x (t) is the Brownian particle displacement, \u03be(t) is\nthe white Gaussian noise with zero mean and correlation\nfunction h\u03be (t) \u03be (t + \u03c4 )i = 2D\u03b4 (\u03c4 ). The potential \u03a6 (x, t)\nis the sum of two terms: the fixed potential U (x) and\nthe randomly switching term V (x) \u03b7 (t). The variable\n\u03b7 (t) is the Markovian dichotomous noise, which takes\nthe values \u00b11 with the mean flipping rate \u03bd. If we invoke\nthe following expression for probability density in terms\nof the average\nW (x, t) = h\u03b4 (x \u2212 x(t))i\n\nFIG. 1: Switching potential with metastable state.\n\nwhere x0 \u2208 (L1 , L2 ). The NLRT is also interpreted\nas mean lifetime of Brownian particles in the interval\n(L1 , L2 ) or average residence time, because, in accordance with Eq. (2), Eq.

(4)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nLet x = x0 be the initial position of Brownian particles.\nThen\n(5)\n\nand W (x, t) becomes the conditional probability density\nW (x, t |x0 , 0 ). Since \u03b7 (0) is a deterministic value, the\ninitial condition for the function Q (x, t) is (see Eqs. (3)\nand (5))\nQ (x, 0) = W (x, 0) \u03b7 (0) = \u00b1\u03b4 (x \u2212 x0 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nLet us consider the potential profiles U (x) \u00b1 V (x) with\na wall at x \u2192 \u2212\u221e and a sink at x \u2192 +\u221e (see Fig. 1).\nThe potential profile U (x) + V (x) corresponds to a\nmetastable state, and U (x) \u2212 V (x) corresponds to an\nunstable one. Thus, we investigate the system with randomly switching metastable state.\nThe nonlinear relaxation time (NLRT) for the state\nlocated in the interval (L1 , L2 ) is defined as follows [13]\nZ \u221e Z L2\nW (x, t |x0 , 0 ) dx,\n(7)\n\u03c4 (x0 ) =\ndt\n0\n\nL1\n\n\u001d\n\n\u03c4 (x0 ) =\n\nL2\n\nZ\n\nY (x, x0 , 0) dx,\n\n(8)\n\nL1\n\nwe obtain the next closed set of equations (see [25, 26]\nand Appendix)\n\nW (x, 0) = \u03b4 (x \u2212 x0 ) ,\n\n\u03b8 (x (t) \u2212 L1 ) \u03b8 (L2 \u2212 x (t)) dt |x (0) = x0\n\nwhere \u03b8 (x) is the step function.\nLet us rewrite the definition (7) in the form\n\nand introduce auxiliary function Q (x, t)\nQ (x, t) = h\u03b7 (t) \u03b4 (x \u2212 x(t))i,\n\n\u221e\n\nwhere Y (x, x0 , s) is the Laplace transform of conditional\nprobability density W (x, t |x0 , 0 ).

For this potential profile, a small\nnoise intensity can return particles into potential well,\nafter they crossed the point L. Then Brownian particles\nstay for long time in the metastable state. This means\nthat, for a fixed mean flipping rate, the NES effect increases when q \u2192 1. For fixed parameter q the effect\nincreases when \u03c9 \u2192 0, because Brownian particles have\nenough time to move back into potential well.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the plots of the normalized mean\nlifetime \u03c4\u2212 (0) /\u03c40 , Eq.

From\nthe general equations (15), we provide exact expression\nof the mean lifetime for piece-wise linear potential, for arbitrary noise intensity, and arbitrary fluctuation rate of\nthe potential. We find the noise enhanced stability and\nthe resonant activation phenomena in the system investigated. We obtained analytically the region on the (q, \u03c9)\nplane, where the NES effect can be observed. Moreover,\nwhen we fix white noise intensity D, flatness q, and vary\nswitchings mean rate \u03bd, we can observe new resonantlike behavior of the mean lifetime, which is related to the\nNES phenomenon. The NLRT shows a maximum as a\nfunction of the mean flipping rate of potential, with the\nNES effect strongly correlated with the potential fluctuations. The general equations derived in this paper enable\nus to perform the analysis of the NES effect conditions in\nphysical systems with more complex potential profiles.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by INTAS Grant 20010450, MIUR, INFM, by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project 02-02-17517), by Federal Program\n\"Scientific Schools of Russia\" (project 1729.2003.2), and\nby Scientific Program \"Universities of Russia\" (project\n01.01.020).\nAPPENDIX\n\nUpon differentiation of Eq.
