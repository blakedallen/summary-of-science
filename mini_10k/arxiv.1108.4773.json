In this paper we investigate the internalization and cytotoxicity of nanostructured\nmaterials having the form of elongated rods, with diameter of 200 nm and lengths 1 \u2013 10 \u03bcm.\nThe rods were made from the controlled aggregation of sub-10 nm iron oxide nanoparticles.\nRecently, we have shown that the nanorods inherited the superparamagnetic property of the\nparticles. These rods can actually be moved by the application of an external magnetic field.\nHere we evaluate the in vitro toxicity of the magnetic nanorods by using MTT assays on\nNIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The toxicity assays revealed that the nanorods are biocompatible,\nas exposed cells remained 100% viable relative to controls over a period of a few days. Optical\nmicroscopy allow to visualize the rods inside the cells and to determine their number per cell.\nRoughly 1/3 of the total incubated rods were uptaken by the fibroblasts.\n\nInorganic nanomaterials and particles with enhanced optical, mechanical or magnetic attributes are\ncurrently being developed for a wide scope of applications, including catalysis, photovoltaics, coating\nand nanomedicine [1]. More generally, nanomaterials of different shapes and sizes are regarded as\npromising tools at the scale of the cell for manipulation, diagnostic and therapy. Interactions between\nnanomaterials and living organisms were also investigated extensively because of the concerns raised\nby their potential toxicity. As shown in several reviews [2, 3], the risk assessment of nanomaterials\ntowards living cells and tissues have not been fully evaluated. Among the wide variety of\nnanomaterials available, magnetic nanowires have received considerable attention [4-8]. Nanowires\nare anisotropic colloidal objects with submicronic diameters and lengths in the range 1 \u2013 100 \u03bcm. In\nspecific applications such as cell separation, ferromagnetic nickel nanowires made by electrodepostion\nwere shown to outperform magnetic beads of comparable volume [5]. However, one major drawback\nencountered with nickel or iron nanowires is that these objects carry a permanent magnetic moment,\nand are thus susceptible to aggregate in solution because of magnetic dipolar attraction [4].\nIn the present paper, we exploit a simple and versatile waterborne synthesis process to generate\nmagnetic nanorods [9, 10]. Highly persistent rods of diameters around 200 nm and lengths comprised\nbetween 1 \u03bcm and 30 \u03bcm were fabricated by controlling the assembly of sub-10 nm iron oxide\nnanoparticles. These magnetic nanorods are different from the ferrimagnetic electrodeposited wires\nmentioned previously. The rods are superparamagnetic i.e. they do not carry a permanent magnetic\nmoment, which prevents their spontaneous aggregation in a dispersion [9, 11]. Since these rods are\ndesigned to be used as micromechanical tools at the cellular level, their interactions with living cells\n\n\fPublished in : Journal of Physics: Conference Series 304 (2011) 012033\nProceeding of the Nanosafe 2010 Conference, Grenoble (France)\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/304/1\n\nneed to be investigated. Here we explore their interactions with NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts and show\nthat the rods were internalized in the cellular matrix. Toxicity assays show that the rods do not display\nacute toxicity towards the cells on a short-term basis. In this study, the effects of the rods on the\nfibroblasts and those of the nanoparticles from which they are made were also compared.\n1. Materials and Methods\n1.1. Chemicals, synthesis and characterization\nThe synthesis of superparamagnetic nanoparticles (NP) used the technique of 'soft chemistry' based\non the polycondensation of metallic salts in alkaline aqueous media elaborated by R. Massart [12].\nThis technique resulted in the formation of magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs of sizes comprised between 4 and\n15 nm. Magnetite nanocrystals were further oxidized into maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3) and sorted according\nto their size. Adding large amount of nitric acid to the dispersions down to pH 0.5 initiated a liquid-gas\ntype phase separation, resulting in coexisting dilute and concentrated phases of \u03b3-Fe2O3 particles. The\nconcentrated phase which contained the largest particles was separated by magnetic sedimentation.\nThe process was repeated 5 times, reducing the initial polydispersity from 0.4 to 0.2. In the synthesis\nconditions, the magnetic dispersions were stabilized by electrostatic interactions arising from the\nnative cationic charges at the surface of the particles. Vibrating sample magnetometry was performed\nto characterize the size distribution of the maghemite cores [13, 14]. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the\nmacroscopic magnetization M(H) normalized by its saturation value MS for the present \u03b3-Fe2O3 batch.\nHere, MS = \u03c6mS, where mS is the volumetric magnetization of maghemite (mS = 2.9\u00d7105 A m-1).\n\nFigure\n1:\nMagnetic\nfield\ndependence of the macroscopic\nmagnetization M(H) of a \u03b3-Fe2O3\ndispersion normalized by its\nsaturation value MS. The solid curve\nwas obtained using the Langevin\nfunction convoluted with a lognormal distribution with median\ndiameter D0 = 6.7 nm and\npolydispersity sNP = 0.21. Inset :\nTransmission electron microscopy\nof iron oxide at the magnification of\n\u00d7120000.\n\nThe solid curve in Fig. 1 was obtained using the Langevin function convoluted with a log-normal\ndistribution function of the particle size. The parameters of the distribution are the median diameter D0\n= 6.7 nm and the polydispersity sNP = 0.21. The polydispersity was defined as the ratio between the\nstandard deviation and average diameter. A transmission electron microscopy image obtained from the\nsame \u03b3-Fe2O3 dispersion is illustrated in the inset of Fig.1. The iron oxide NPs exhibited compact and\nspherical structures, with size and polydispersity in excellent agreement with the VSM data [14].\nIn order to improve their colloidal stability, the cationic particles were coated by poly(acrylic acid)\noligomers. Poly(sodium acrylate), the salt form of poly(acrylic acid) with a molecular weight MW =\n\n\fPublished in : Journal of Physics: Conference Series 304 (2011) 012033\nProceeding of the Nanosafe 2010 Conference, Grenoble (France)\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/304/1\n\n2000 g mol\u22121 and a polydispersity of 1.7 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further\npurification. In order to adsorb polyelectrolytes on the surface of the nanoparticles, we followed the\nPrecipitation\u2013Redispersion protocol, as described elsewhere [14, 15]. The precipitation of the iron\noxide dispersions by PAA2K was performed in acidic conditions (pH 2). The precipitate was separated\nfrom the solution by centrifugation and its pH was increased by the addition of ammonium hydroxide.\nThe precipitate redispersed spontaneously at pH 7\u20138, yielding a clear solution that contained the\npolymer coated particles. The hydrodynamic sizes found in coated NPs were 6 nm above that of the\nbare particles, indicating the presence of a 3 nm PAA2K brush surrounding the particles. This simple\ntechnique allowed us to produce large quantities of coated particles (> 1 g of oxides) within a\nrelatively short time (< 1 h) [16]. The fabrication of the rods was performed using these coated\nparticles, noted PAA2K\u2013\u03b3-Fe2O3 in the following.\n\nFigure 2 : Phase-contrast optical\nmicroscopy images (40\u00d7) of a\ndispersion of nanostructured rods\nmade from 6.7 nm \u03b3-Fe2O3\nparticles in absence of magnetic\nfield. Inset : Length distribution\nof the rods. The distribution was\nfound to be log-normal with\nmedian length and polydispersity\nnoted L0 = 15 \u03bcm and sR = 0.40\nrespectively.\n\nThe fabrication of the nanorods is based on the NPs co-assembly in the presence of a magnetic field.\nThe adopted strategy involved in a first step the preparation of two separate 1 M NH4Cl solutions\ncontaining respectively i) the anionic iron oxide NPs (PAA2K\u2013\u03b3-Fe2O3) and ii) the PTEA11K-b-PAM30K\ndiblock copolymers. These copolymers (PTEA-b-PAM stands for poly(trimethylammonium\nethylacrylate)-b-poly(acrylamide)) were synthesized by MADIX\u00ae controlled radical polymerization\nwhich is a Rhodia patented process [17]. The initial concentrations were adjusted to c = 0.1 wt. % for\nboth NPs and copolymers. In a second step, the two solutions were mixed with each other and it was\nchecked by dynamic light scattering that the two components remained dispersed [9, 11]. In a third\nstep, the ionic strength of the mixture was progressively diminished by dialysis in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field (0.1 T). Dialysis was performed against de-ionized water using a Slide-aLyzer\u00ae cassette with MWCO of 10 kD (Thermo Scientific). The volume of the dialysis bath was 300\nlarger than that of the samples. The electrical conductivity (Cyberscan PC6000) of the dialysis bath\nwas measured during the ion exchange and served to monitor the desalting kinetics. In the conditions\ndescribed here, the whole process reached a stationary and final state within one hour. Once the ionic\nstrength of the bath reached its stationary value, (3\u00d710\u22123 M), the external magnetic field was removed\nand the dispersions were studied by optical microscopy (Fig. 2). In order to determine the length\ndistribution of the rods, pictures were digitized and treated by the ImageJ software\n(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The inset of Fig. 2 displays the length distribution function that was\ndetermined from a panel of 250 objects. It was found to be log-normal with a median length of L0 = 15\n\n\fPublished in : Journal of Physics: Conference Series 304 (2011) 012033\nProceeding of the Nanosafe 2010 Conference, Grenoble (France)\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/304/1\n\n\u03bcm and a polydispersity sR = 0.4 (continuous line). Rods were further sonicated to reduce their average\nlength down to 3 \u03bcm.\n1.2. Experimental Methods\n1.2.1. Cell culture\nNIH/3T3 fibroblast cells from mice were grown as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's\nmedium (DMEM) with high glucose (4.5 g L-1) and stable glutamine (PAA Laboratories GmbH,\nAustria). This medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%\npenicillin/streptomycin (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Austria), referred to as cell culture medium.\nExponentially growing cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air\nat 37\u00b0C, and under these conditions the plating efficiency was 70 \u2013 90% and the cell duplication time\nwas 12\u201314 h. Cell cultures were passaged twice weekly using trypsin\u2013EDTA (PAA Laboratories\nGmbH, Austria) to detach the cells from their culture flasks and wells. The cells were pelleted by\ncentrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min.\n1.2.2. Transmission optical Microscopy\nFor optical microscopy observations, phase-contrast images of the cells containing rods were acquired\non an IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with 40\u00d7 and 60\u00d7 objectives. 2\u00d7104 NIH/3T3\nfibroblasts cells were first seeded onto a 96-well plate for 24 h prior being incubated with nanorods.\n\u03bcl-aliquots containing nanorods were added to the supernatant. The incubation of the rods lasted 24\nhours. The third day, the excess medium was removed and the cells were washed with PBS solution\n(with calcium and magnesium, Dulbecco's, PAA Laboratories), trypsinized and centrifuged. The cell\npellets were resuspended in DMEM. For optical microscopy, 20 \u03bcl of the previous cell suspension\nwere deposited on a glass plate and sealed into to a Gene Frame\u00ae (Abgene/Advanced Biotech) dual\nadhesive system. The sample was then left for 4 h in the incubator to let the cells adhere onto the glass\nplate. Images were observed using a Photometrics Cascade camera (Roper Scientific) and Metaview\nsoftware (Universal Imaging Inc.) as acquisition system.\n1.2.3. MILC protocol\nUV-visible spectrometry was performed in the MILC protocol (Mass of metal Internalized/Adsorbed\nby Living Cells) which consist in the measurement of the mass of nanoparticles incorporated into\nliving cells. The quantity to be determined is the mass of iron expressed in the unit of picogram per\ncell. Cells were seeded onto 3.6 cm Petri dishes, and incubated until reaching 60% confluence and\nthen incubated with nanomaterials, including the nanorods at different concentrations for 24 h. After\nthe incubation period, the supernatant was removed and the layer of cells washed thoroughly with\nPBS. The cells were then trypsinised and mixed again with white DMEM without serum. 20 \u03bclaliquots were taken up for counting using a Malassez plate. The cells were finally centrifuged and\npellets were dissolved in 35% HCl. When incubated with \u03b3-Fe2O3, the HCl dissolved NIH/3T3\nexhibited a yellow color. The absorbance of the liquid was studied using a Variant spectrophotometer\n(Cary 50 Scan), and it was compared to a calibrated reference. The reference was obtained by\ndissolving directly \u03b3-Fe2O3 dispersions of known concentrations into 35% HCl.\n\n1.2.4. MTT toxicity assays\n\n\fPublished in : Journal of Physics: Conference Series 304 (2011) 012033\nProceeding of the Nanosafe 2010 Conference, Grenoble (France)\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/304/1\n\nMTT assays were performed with PAA2K-coated iron oxide nanoparticles and nanorods for metal\nmolar concentrations [Fe] between 10 \u03bcM and 10 mM. To avoid contamination from synthesis\nresidues and free ions, nanoparticle and nanorod dispersions were dialyzed against DI-water which pH\nwas adjusted to 8 by addition of sodium hydroxide (Spectra Por 2 dialysis membrane with MWCO 12\nkD). Cells were seeded into 96-well microplates, and the plates were placed in an incubator overnight\nto allow for attachment and recovery. Cell densities were adjusted to 2\u00d7104 cells per well (200 \u03bcl).\nAfter 24 h, the nanoparticles and nanorods were applied directly to each well using a multichannel\npipette. Cultures were incubated in triplicate for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. The MTT assay depends on the cellular\nreduction of MTT (3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Sigma Aldrich\nChemical) by the mitochondrial dehydrogenase of viable cells forming a blue formazan product which\ncan be measured spectrophotometrically [18]. MTT was prepared at 5 mg ml-1 in PBS (with calcium\nand magnesium, Dulbecco's, PAA Laboratories) and then diluted 1\u20135 in medium without serum and\nwithout Phenol Red. After 24 h of incubation with nanoparticles, the medium was removed and 200 \u03bcl\nof the MTT solution was added to the microculture wells. After 4 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the MTT\nsolution was removed and 100 \u03bcl of 100% DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the MTT\u2013\nformazan product. The absorbance at 562 nm was then measured with a microplate reader (Perkin\nElmer). Prior to the microplate UV\u2013vis spectrometry, MTT assays without particles were carried out\nwith cell populations ranging from 5\u00d7103 to 5\u00d7105 cells.\n\nFigure 3. a) Phase contrast microscopy images of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts cells\ntreated with nanorods for 24 h at a concentration of 30 rods/cell. b) Zoom of the\nprevious image to emphasize the perinuclear region of a unique cell.

Nanorods are internalized by the cells\nFig. 3a shows a cluster of cells that were incubated with magnetic nanorods of average length 10 \u03bcm\nand at 30 rods per cell. In this work, the nanorod concentration was defined by the ratio of the number\nof rods incubated per cell. To allow comparison with data on \u03b3-Fe2O3 NPs or with data from the\nliterature, it was also expressed in terms of iron molar concentration [Fe] (30 rods per cell corresponds\nto [Fe] = 0.15 mM). The cells were found to maintain their morphology and adherence properties after\na 24 h exposure. Fig. 3b displays a zoom of the previous image and emphasizes the perinuclear region\nof a single cell. There, elongated threads with lengths comprised between 1 to 7 \u03bcm and with random\norientations are observed (arrows).

The orientational fluctuations of the rods were recorded as a function of the time and\ncompared with those of rods dispersed in water. It was found that the rotational diffusion constant was\nmuch slower for the internalized objects, in good agreement with recent estimations of the viscosity of\nthe intracellular matrix [19]. These results also suggest that the internalization of nanorods was\noptimized when their length corresponded to the average size of the adherent cells [5].\n\nFigure 4 : Amount of internalized or\nadsorbed iron oxide MFe (pg/cell)\ndetermined following the MILC\nprotocol (see text for details).

Quantitative determination of internalized iron oxide\nThe amount of internalized or adsorbed iron oxide was determined following the protocol MILC\n(Mass of metal Internalized/Adsorbed by Living Cells) which makes use of UV spectrophotometry to\ncalculate the iron concentration from pelleted cells dissolved in concentrated HCl. The results (MFe\nversus [Fe]) were expressed in picograms of iron per cell. Here, [Fe] denotes the iron oxide molar\nconcentration in the supernatant during the 24 h of incubation. Fig. 4 compares the [Fe]-dependences\nof internalized/adsorbed amounts for uncoated NPs and for the nanorods (L0 = 3 \u03bcm, sR = 0.5). In the\ninset, UV-cells containing increasing concentrations of iron oxide dissolved in HCl are shown for\nillustration. The thick straight line in Fig. 4 depicts the maximum amount of iron that could be uptaken\nby the cells. For instance, 3\u00d7106 of fibroblasts exposed to a [Fe] = 1 mM solution, the maximum\namount lies at 37 pg/cell. For the uncoated particles and for the nanorods, MFe increases linearly and\nrepresents about 35% of the maximum value. Optical microscopy carried out 24 h after incubation and\nthorough washing shown that none of the rods were adsorbed at the cell membranes, leading to the\nconclusion that the MFe-data in Fig. 4 represent the amount of internalized iron under the form of\nnanorod. For uncoated \u03b3-Fe2O3, the large quantities detected up to [Fe] = 10 mM were explained by\nthe precipitation of the particles in the culture medium. This precipitation produced large and compact\nclusters in the micrometer range (1 \u2013 20 \u03bcm) [16] that for the most part were adsorbed on the plasma\nmembrane. Thorough washing with PBS buffer did not desorb these aggregates, probably because of\ntheir positive surface charges.\n2.3. Toxicity assays\n\n\fPublished in : Journal of Physics: Conference Series 304 (2011) 012033\nProceeding of the Nanosafe 2010 Conference, Grenoble (France)\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/304/1\n\nCytoxicity studies determine the cellular alterations or damages of vital functions induced by\nxenobiotics. MTT viability assays were conducted on NIH/3T3 cells for the uncoated \u03b3-Fe2O3 particles\n([Fe] = 10 \u03bcM - 10 mM) and for the nanorods (L0 = 3 \u03bcm, [Fe] = 0.1 \u03bcM - 1 mM). The comparison\nbetween this two types of nanomaterials aimed to identify the role of size and morphology on the cell\nsurvival. A rod concentration of 1 mM corresponded to 100 rods per cell. Exposure times were set at\n24 h. As shown in Figs. 5 for both studies, the viability remained at a 100% level within experimental\naccuracy. These findings indicate a normal mitochondrial activity for the cultures tested. The results\non the precipitated \u03b3-Fe2O3 are in good agreement with earlier reports [20, 21]. As mentioned before,\nfor this system most of the NPs were precipitated into large clusters that were not internalized because\nof their size (> 10 \u03bcm), but rather adsorbed on the plasma membranes. For the nanorods, the data also\nconfirm those obtained recently on parent micron-size materials, such as silica [22] or carbon\nnanotubes [23]. In conclusion, the MTT assays show conclusive evidences and ensure the suitability of\nthe rods for biomedical and biophysical applications.\n\nFigure 5. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) viability assays\nconducted on NIH/3T3 cells incubated during 24 h with a) uncoated \u03b3-Fe2O3 NPs and b) 3 \u03bcmnanorods. In this work, the nanorod concentration was defined by the ratio of the number of rods\nincubated per cell. To allow comparison with data from the literature, it was also expressed in\nterms of iron molar concentration [Fe].\n\n3. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have evaluated the interactions and toxicity of magnetic nanorods with respect to\nNIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Magnetic nanorods are a particularly promising class of nanomaterials\nsince they can be used in confined geometries for cell manipulation, microrheology and microfluidics.\nThe magnetic properties of the rods were inherited from the iron oxide particles, and allow to rotate\nthe rods in a propeller-like motion by the application of an external field [9, 10]. Our approach with\ncell culture consisted to show that the rods were internalized and biocompatible with living fibroblasts.\nConcerning the first point, quantitative measurements of internalized amounts revealed that 3 \u03bcmnanorods were uptaken in large proportion, typically 35% of the initial seeded quantity. Direct\nvisualization of the rods inside the cytoplasm by optical microscopy also confirmed these conclusions\n: a large number of incubated rods were able to cross the cell plasma membranes. In the future, we\nplan to use transmission electron microscopy to identify if the rods are located in intracellular\ncompartments or directly dispersed in the cytosol, and to have a better insight about the portals of\n\n\fPublished in : Journal of Physics: Conference Series 304 (2011) 012033\nProceeding of the Nanosafe 2010 Conference, Grenoble (France)\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/304/1\n\nentry into the cells. From these initial studies, it is concluded that the iron oxide based nanorods can be\nused safely with living cells, e.g. as microtools for in vitro and in vivo applications.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported in part by Rhodia (France), by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche\nunder the contracts BLAN07-3_206866 and ANR-09-NANO-P200-36, by the European Community\nthrough the project : \"NANO3T-Biofunctionalized Metal and Magnetic Nanoparticles for Targeted\nTumor Therapy\", project number 214137 (FP7-NMP-2007-SMALL-1) and by the R\u00e9gion Ile-deFrance in the DIM framework related to Health, Environnement and Toxicology (SEnT).\nReferences\n[1]\nKim J, Piao Y, Hyeon T.
