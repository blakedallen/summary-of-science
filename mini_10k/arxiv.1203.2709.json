In an electromagnetism in the vacuum, described by Maxwell's equations,\nmagnetic field and electric field are not symmetric, since there is no monopole, a particle having\na finite magnetic charge. Still, monopole has been an exciting object for a long time, and was\ndiscussed on a phenomenological ground by Dirac in 1931. A theoretical possibility of monopole\ngeneration was first given by 't Hooft and Polyakov in 1974 in a context of a symmetry breaking in\na grand unified theory (GUT). A GUT monopole has not been discovered in experiments so far. In\ncontrast to in the vacuum, several kinds of monopoles are expected to emerge in solids associated\nwith various symmetry breaking mechanisms. Of particular interest is metallic ferromagnetic\nsystems, since a breaking of a symmetry of conduction electron spin, described by an SU(2) algebra,\ncan give rise to monopoles. Indeed two monopoles are theoretically predicted in ferromagnets; one\nis a hedgehog monopole arising from a topological spin structure and the other arising from spin\ndamping in the presence of spin-orbit interaction. In this paper, we focus on these monopoles,\nwhile other objects similar to monopoles but not coupled to effective electromagnetic fields, such\nas spin ice monopoles, are touched only briefly in the introduction. Those monopoles are extended\nobjects coupled to effective electromagnetic fields, which are described by Maxwell's equations\nwith monopole contribution. The effective fields are the one coupled to spin of a particle like\nelectron, muon and neutron; two monopoles are thus detectable by electric measurements. Spin\ndamping monopoles can be generated in simple systems such as a junction of a ferromagnet and a\nheavy element with strong spin-orbit interaction such as Pt. This monopole is essential in coupling\nelectronics with magnetism, and is thus expected to play an essential role in spintronics.\nKeywords: Monopole, Spintronics, Spin current, Maxwell's equations\n\n\u2217\n\ntatara@tmu.ac.jp\n\n1\n\n\fFIG. 1.\n\nLeft: Schematic figure of a magnet and magnetic field around it. Right: A monopole,\n\nparticle having only N (or S) magnetic pole, and the magnetic field it emits.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA.\n\nMonopole\n\nMacroscopic magnets have two poles called N (north) and S (south) at two different edges\n(Fig. 1). We also know that we cannot extract only N or S pole from magnets; when we\ndivide a magnet, a pair of N and S poles is created at the edge and each piece becomes a\nmagnet with the equal amount of N and S poles. There is therefore no monopole at least\nin the energy scale we concern in our life. This is because the magnets are made of spin,\na quantum magnet the electron carries, which creates the divergencelss magnetic field only.\nIn other words, each spin contain N and S poles, which are not separable since elementary\nparticles are pointlike.\n\nPossibility of a particle carrying only N or S pole, called magnetic monopole, was first\ndiscussed by Dirac [1]. He showed based on a macroscopic consideration that monopole is\ntied to a string of singularity, and its existence is allowed only if the charge of the monopole is\nquantized by unit of 2\u03c0~/e (e is the electron charge). A microscopic mechanism of monopole\ncreation was theoretically discovered by 't Hooft [2] and Polyakov [3] independently. They\nshowed that monopole arises in a grand unified theory (GUT) of elementally particles when\nthe symmetry breaking of the SU(5) symmetry to the U(1) symmetry of the electromagnetic\nfield occurs. Such monopoles may have been created in the early universe (at about 10\u221210\nsec after the big bang) and may still be around us. So far, however, no evidence has been\nobtained in experiments waiting for a monopole from universe to go through superconducting\n2\n\n\fdetectors [4] or detecting the ionization [5]. The energy scale of the GUT monopole is 1017\nGeV, and so creating one in accelerator on the earth is impossible.\n\nB.\n\nMaxwell's equations without monopole\n\nBefore starting to discuss monopoles, let us discuss the law of conventional electromagnetism without monopole. We know that electric field, E, and magnetic field, B, behave\ndifferently, i.e., electric field has finite divergence while magnetic field is divengenceless [6].\nTo put in equations,\n\u2207*E =\n\n\u03c1\n\u01eb\n\n\u2207 * B = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is charge density and \u01eb is dielectric constant. The two fields are governed by another\nset of equations describing rotational components;\n\u2207\u00d7E =\u2212\n\n\u2202B\n\u2202t\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 B = \u03bcj + \u01eb\u03bc\n\n\u2202E\n,\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc is magnetic permeability and j is current density. The fields E and B are therefore\nnot symmetric; magnetic field is generated by electric current by the Amp\u00e8re's law, while\nthere is no driving current for electric field. One may imagine that the electromagnetism law\nis more beautiful if there is a current that drives electric field via an analog of the Amp\u00e8re's\nlaw. Let us write such current as jm . The first equation of Eq. (2) then becomes\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2212jm \u2212\n\n\u2202B\n.\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nTaking the divergence of this equation, we have\n0 = \u2212\u2207 * jm \u2212\n\n\u2202\n(\u2207 * B),\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nwhich indicates that the second equation of Eq. (1) needs to be modified as\n\u2207 * B = \u03c1m ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c1m is a quantity satisfying a conservation law of\n\u03c1 \u0307m + \u2207 * jm = 0.\n\n(6)\n3\n\n\fFIG. 2. Left) The Amp\u00e8re's law allows us to generate magnetic field from the electric current, j.\nIn contrast, there is no Amp\u00e8re's law for the electric field in the electromagnetism if U(1) symmetry\nis exact. The exception is the case with monopole: monopole current, jm , generates E (Right).\n\nEquation (5) indicates that \u03c1m emits a magnetic field like a N or S pole; hence \u03c1m is a density\nof monopole. The current jm is then a monopole current. Thus, if monopole exists, E and\nB become symmetric, and the electric field can be generated by applying the monopole\ncurrent.\n\nThe aim of this short review is to give an introductory description of monopoles in\ncondensed matter and explain in detail monopoles in ferromagnetic metals. The paper is\norganized as follows. Monopole is discussed from a macroscopic viewpoint in \u00a7II. Section III\nis a brief introduction of monopoles in solids. Other topological objects similar to monopoles\nare introduced in \u00a7IV. These objects are touched only briefly, since we would like in this paper\nto focus on monopoles which really couple to electromagnetism via Maxwell's equations.\nSections V and VI are the main content of the paper presenting theoretical description\nof hedgehog monopole and spin damping monopole, respectively. Relativistic notation is\nsummarized in \u00a7A and spin damping is briefly described in \u00a7B.\nII.\n\nMONOPOLE FROM MACROSCOPIC VIEWPOINT : DIRAC'S STRING\n\nLet us go on to discuss monopoles from a macroscopic viewpoint, i.e., based on the\nMaxwell's equations. As is well-known, in the electromagnetism without monopole, the\nmagnetic field B is expressed as a rotation of a vector potential, namely, as B = \u2207 \u00d7 A.\nWhen monopole is present, this is no longer true, but still one can define a vector potential\n4\n\n\fas a line integral over a certain line L starting from monopole to the infinity. Let us consider\na case of a single monopole at r = 0,\nB(r) =\n\ng r\n,\n4\u03c0 r 3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere g is a monopole charge. We can define a \"vector potential\"\n(L)\nAi (r)\n\n=\n\nX\njk\n\n\u01ebijk\n\nZ\n\nL\n\ndrj\u2032 Bk (r \u2212 r \u2032 ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Bk is the kth component of the magnetic field (including monopole) and L is a string\nconnecting r = 0 and the infinity. The \"magnetic field\" of this vector potential A(L) then\nreads\n\u2207\u00d7A\n\n(L)\n\n(r) = B(r) +\n\nZ\n\nL\n\ndr \u2032\u03c1m (r \u2212 r \u2032 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c1m is the monopole density, \u03c1m (r) = g\u03b4 3 (r) if a single monopole case. The first term\nof Eq. (9) correctly reproduces the field B but we have an additional non local singular\nfield represented by the second term. The singular magnetic field represented by the second\nterm of Eq. (9) exists along the string L. Dirac argued therefore that monopole needs to\nhave such string (called the Dirac's string) but this string must not been \"seen\" by physical\nparticles [1]. If many monopoles exist, many strings L each attached to a single monopole\nare needed to describe the vector potential.\nThe unobservability of the string is ensured if the monopole charge g is quantized to\ncertain values. One way to derive the quantization condition is to impose the condition that\nthe shift of the Dirac's string does not modify the wave function of the charged particles [6].\nEquation (8), explicitely written in a single monopole case reads\nZ\n\u2032\ng X\n(L)\n\u2032 (r \u2212 r )k\n\u01ebijk drj\n.\nAi (r) =\n4\u03c0 jk\n|r \u2212 r \u2032 |3\nL\nIf one shift the string L to be another string L\u2032 , the vector potential changes to\nZ\n(r \u2212 r \u2032 )k\ng X\n(L\u2032 )\n(L)\n\u01ebijk\ndrj\u2032\n,\nAi (r) = Ai (r) +\n4\u03c0\n|r \u2212 r \u2032 |3\nC\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\njk\n\nwhere C = L\u2032 \u2212 L is a closed path surrounded by L and L\u2032 . The last term of the right-hand\nside is proportional to the derivative of the solid angle \u03a9C (r) subtended by C observed at r.\n5\n\n\f4\u03c0\u2212\u03a9 C\nC\n\nP'\n\n\u03a9C\nP\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nWhen a solid angle of a closed path C observed at P is \u03a9C , it is 4\u03c0 \u2212 \u03a9C at P' in the\n\nopposite side of the path.\n\nIn fact, a difference of solid angles observed at r and r + \u03b4r, which we call \u03b4\u03a9C , is (noting\nthat dr \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b4r is a vector normal to the plane having a length of an element of area)\nZ\nr\u2032 \u2212 r\n.\n\u03b4\u03a9C = (dr \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b4r) *\n|r \u2212 r \u2032 |3\nC\nWe therefore see that\nZ\n(r \u2212 r \u2032 )\n,\n\u2207\u03a9C =\ndr \u2032 \u00d7\n|r \u2212 r \u2032 |3\nC\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nand that Eq. (11) becomes\n\u2032\n\nA(L ) = A(L) +\n\ng\n\u2207\u03a9C .\n4\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nSince a phase for the electron's wave function is given by an integral of the vector potential,\nie g\n\nthis modification of the vector potential results in a phase change of e ~ 4\u03c0 \u03a9C . Quantum\nmechanics requires that this phase is single-valued. However, solid angle \u03a9C is not singlevalued. Multi-valuedness of \u03a9C occurs when \u03a9C changes by 4\u03c0 as an electron goes through\nthe plane spanned by C (Fig. 3). The single-valuedness of the electron's phase is thus\nensured by requiring that\neg = 2\u03c0n~,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere n is an integer. This is the quantization condition for the monopole charge, pointed\nout by Dirac.\nThe above argument is based on the assumption that the magnetic field is written as a\nrotation of a U(1) vector potential even in the presence of monopoles. This assumption,\n6\n\n\fhowever, is wrong, since the exact U(1) gauge invariance does not exist when monopole\nexists. As we will show later, the monopole field in the case of the symmetry breaking\nmechanism is expressed by the additional field orthogonal to the U(1) degrees of freedom.\nThe Dirac's string containing a singular magnetic field (the last term of Eq. (9)), is thus an\nartifact arising when one tries to describe the monopole field within the U(1) gauge theory\nassuming B = \u2207 \u00d7 A, and it is eliminated when one takes account of microscopic origin of\nthe monopole.\nIn the case of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, monopole is created from the symmetry\nbreaking [7]. Their argument is for a system of non-Abelian gauge field coupled to a Higgs\nrepresented by a vector field, \u03c6\u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y, z). They showed that there is a solution where\nHiggs field behaves at the infinity as\n\u03c6\u03b1 \u221d\n\nr\u03b1\n(r \u2192 \u221e).\nr\n\n(16)\n\nIn this configuration, magnetic field is shown to contain monopole, and monopole density is\ndetermined by Higgs field as\n\u03c1m \u221d\n\nXX\n\n\u01ebijk \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2202i \u03c6\u03b1 \u2202j \u03c6\u03b2 \u2202k \u03c6\u03b3 .\n\n(17)\n\nijk \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\nA volume integral of this monopole density is written as a surface integral at the infinity,\nand it turns out to take only integer value called a winding number. This topological nature\nof the Higgs field leads to a quantization of monopole charge. Thus, 't Hooft-Polyakov\nmonopole emerges from a symmetry breaking from non-Abelian group to U(1) group driven\nby a condensation of Higgs field. Dirac's string is not necessary here, since monopole field\nis created from Higgs field, which is different from a gauge field.\nIn \u00a7V, we will discuss in detail a monopole arising from a symmetry breaking in ferromagnets.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nMONOPOLES IN SOLIDS\nHedgehog monopole\n\nAs we have mentioned, in the electromagnetism in the vacuum, monopole predicted at\nhigh energy has not been found. Even if it is found in the future, we cannot make a device\n7\n\n\fFIG. 4.\n\nSchematic illustration of a magnetization structure for a hedgehog monopole, discussed\n\nby Volovik. This structure has a singularity at the center, and is topologically non-trivial. The\nelectron coupled to this magnetization structure feels the effective electromagnetic field with a\nmonopole.\n\nsince its energy is too high. In contrast to electromagnetism in the vacuum, we have hope\nin solids. In fact, electrons in solids feel another U(1) gauge field which couples to the\nelectron's spin [8]. The spins are object in an SU(2) space, and thus if the breaking of its\nsymmetry occurs, a resulting effective U(1) gauge field may contain monopoles according to\nthe 't Hooft and Polyakov scenario. In addition, the energy scale of the symmetry breaking\nis at low energy, less than 1eV, and so device application would be straightforward.\nSuch a monopole was indeed theoretically pointed out to exist in ferromagnetic metals\nby Volovik in 1987 [9]. In fact, a monopole arises from a strong sd coupling between the\nconduction electron and local spin, which specifies the projection of the conduction electron\nspin having SU(2) symmetry to a U(1) space. When local spin structure is a topologically non-trivial one called a hedgehog, the projected effective electromagnetic field contains\nmonopoles.\n\nB.\n\nSpin damping monopole\n\nRecently, another monopole in ferromagnetic metals was predicted [10, 11]. The idea is\nto include spin-orbit interaction besides sd interaction. Spin-orbit interaction modifies the\nprojection to the U(1) plane defined by the sd interaction, and thus new monopole may arise\n8\n\n\fFIG. 5. Schematic illustration of a spin damping monopole. A damping of spin (S) generates an\norbital angular momentum L for electrons when spin-orbit interaction (SO) acts. A circular motion\ndue to the orbital angular momentum is equivalent to that caused by an electric field induced by\na monopole current jm via Amp\u00e8re's law.\n\nwhen the spin-orbit interaction is included. The monopole generation in such case cannot be\ndiscussed by use of gauge fields, since the spin-orbit interaction is not a gauge interaction.\nInstead, novel method based on a transport calculation was applied by Takeuchi and Tatara\n[10]. They derived effective electromagnetic fields by calculating the electric current by use\nof Keldysh Green's functions, and showed that the fields satisfy Maxwell's equation with\nmonopole. In their unique approach, a knowledge of gauge invariance was not necessary\nto explore the structure of the electromagnetism. This fact may sound surprising, but\nis natural, since a U(1) gauge invariance is equivalent to charge conservation law, which\nis strictly observed in transport calculations. In their case, a deviation from exact U(1)\ninvariance due to spin-orbit interaction resulted in a monopole contribution. Based on the\ntransport method, they revealed that monopole arises when the spin structure is dynamic\nand when spin-orbit interaction is included. More specifically, monopole arises when there\nis a damping of spin, represented by a damping vector (see \u00a7B),\nN \u2261 S \u00d7 \u1e60,\n\n(18)\n\n(S being local spin), and thus the monopole was named the spin damping monopole.\nA physical mechanism of spin damping monopole is understood as a transfer of the spin\nangular momentum to orbital one (Fig. 5). In fact, a vector \u03b1N , where \u03b1 is the Gilbert\ndamping parameter (proportional to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction if in metals),\nrepresents the spin angular momentum dissipated. This lost angular momentum is converted\ninto the orbital motion of the electrons by the spin-orbit interaction, inducing the circular\n9\n\n\fFIG. 6. A scalar spin chirality subtended by three spins represents non-coplanarity. Spin chirality\nreduces to spin Berry's phase in the slowly varying limit.\n\norbital motion of the electrons. This circular motion is regarded as a result of a fictitious\nmagnetic field due to a monopole. \u00bfFrom this intuitive explanation, the monopole density\nshould appear when the spin damping is spatially inhomogeneous. This is indeed consistent\nwith the result of Ref. [10], which showed that the monopole density is \u03c1m \u221d \u2207*N . Similarly,\nwhen the spin damping is time-dependent, a monopole current arises since a temporal change\nof effective magnetic field is equivalent to a monopole current. The spin damping monopole\nwas argued to be essential in the spin-charge conversion in spintronics phenomena such as\nthe inverse spin Hall effect [12].\nThese monopoles in ferromagnetic systems are discussed in detail in \u00a7V and \u00a7VI.\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nRELATED TOPOLOGICAL OBJECTS IN SOLIDS\n\nSpin chirality\n\nThere are several objects closely related to monopoles. Spin chirality is one example. In\na spin system on a lattice, a non-coplanarity of three spins, S1 , S2 and S3 , is represented\nby a scalar product called a scalar chirality, \u03c7 \u2261 S1 * (S2 \u00d7 S3 ) (Fig. 6). When the spin\nstructure is slowly varying in space, spin chirality can be expanded as\n\nS(x) * (S(x1 ) \u00d7 S(x2 )) \u2243\n\nX\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(x1 \u2212 x)\u03bc (x2 \u2212 x)\u03bd S(x) * (\u2202\u03bc S(x) \u00d7 \u2202\u03bd S(x)),\n10\n\n(19)\n\n\fFIG. 7.\n\nSchematic illustration of a magnetic vortex (left) and a skyrmion (right). These are\n\ntwo-dimensional structures of magnetization with topological meaning. The topological number of\na vortex is the number of spin rotation as one travels along the perimeter, called a vorticity. In a\nskyrmion structure, the spins at the perimeter is fixed to be parallel (spin down in this figure), and\nits topological number is the number of spin rotation as one travels from the origin to the infinity\nalong the radial direction. Vortex and skyrmion in this figure have a topological number of one.\n\nand the spin chirality reduces to the spin Berry phase. In the continuum limit, therefore, a\nscalar chirality is represend by a vector\n\u03c7i \u2261\n\nX\njk\n\n\u01ebijk S * (\u2207j S \u00d7 \u2207k S),\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the direction i is orthogonal to a plane the three spins lie. This expression of the scalar\nchirality is proportional to spin Berry's phase or a local effective magnetic field generated\nby a hedgehog monopole (see Eq. (46)). One should note, however, that finite local spin\nchirality does not necessarily mean that a monopole exists; monopole exisitence requires a\nR\nsurface integral of the chirality, dS * \u03c7 (dS is an element of surface integral), to be finite,\nand this is realized only for a three-dimensional hedgehog structure shown in Fig. 4.\n\nEven when monopoles do not exit, a finite spin chirality leads to interesting physics, such\nas inducing chirality-driven exotic anomalous Hall effect [13, 14]. When spin structure such\nas domain wall is dynamic, the effective electric field acting on the electron's spin, the spin\nmotive force, is induced (see Eq. (46)). Spin motive force was detected in the case of moving\ndomain wall [15].\nA monopole was also found in systems of conventional anomalous Hall effect driven by\nspin-orbit interaction [16, 17]. This monopole is a singularity in the momentum space and\nis not coupled to the electromagnetism by Maxwell's equations.\n11\n\n\fFIG. 8.\n\nLeft: Ground state spin configuration in a frustrated magnet with a pyrochlore lattice.\n\nAll the tetrahedra contains two in-spins and two out-spins, satisfying ice rule. Right: An excited\nstate of a spin ice. Due to a flip of a spin connecting the two tetrahedra, left tetrahedra has three\nout-spins and the right tetrahedra has only one out-spin. This configuration contains effective\nmonopoles; positive and negative ones on the left and right tetrahedra, respectively.\n\nB.\n\nVortex and skyrmion\n\nMagnetic vortex and skyrmion in magnets are spin structures having topological feature\nin two-dimensions (Fig. 7) [18]. They have finite value of local spin chirality. A vortex is a\nstructure where the number of spin rotation as one travels along the circle at the infinity (or\nthe edge of the disk) is the topological number called a vorticity, which is an integer. Vortex\nstate is stable in a small circular disk of submicron size since the magnetostatic energy at\nthe edge is the lowest for the vortex state [19]. Switching of a vortex core by an electric\ncurrent is a hot issue from a viewpoint of fundamental science and application to non-volatile\nmemories. At present, rather large current density of 3.5 \u00d7 1011 A/m2 is necessary for a core\nflip, and the switching time is not very fast, about 20ns [20].\nSkyrmion was originally proposed in high energy physics. In condensed matter, a magnetization structure shown in Fig. 7 is called a skyrmion [21]. Such a structure was predicted\nto arise when the inversion symmetry is broken. Skyrmions forming a lattice were observed\nin MnSi [22, 23]. Vortices and skyrmions have finite effective magnetic field, Bs , but these\ntopological structures are nothing to do with monopole (\u03c1m and jm vanish), since they are\ntwo-dimensional objects.\n12\n\n\fC.\n\nSpin ice monopole\n\nMonopoles in frustrated magnets with pyrochlore lattice is a hot subject recently [24]. In\nthe ground state of pyrochlore spin system, each tetrahedra has two spins pointing to the\ncenter of tetrahedra (in-spin) and two spins pointing outwards (out-spin), satisfying so called\nan ice rule. When the system is excited, ice rule is broken and some of tetrahedra contain\nthree in-spins and there arise the same number of tetrahedra with three out-spins (Fig.\n8). In such excited states, tetrahedra with broken ice rule have nonvanishing divergence of\nmagnetization, \u2207 * M \u2261 \u03c1M . In terms of magnetic field H \u2261\n\n1\nB\n\u03bc0\n\n\u2212 M , the excited states\n\nof spin ice systems thus have monopoles, i.e., \u2207 * H = \u2212\u03c1M [25]. The spin configuration\ncorresponding to monopoles has been observed by neutron scattering experiment [26]. In\naddition, an effective magnetic charge of a spin ice monopole was measured in Dy2 Ti2 O7\n[27, 28]. Spin ice system is also created recently on an artificial square lattice [29].\nOne should understand that spin ice monopole is not a real monopole, since \u2207 * B = 0 is\nstrictly true even in the presence of any spin configurations; it is a monopole of an artificial\nmagnetic field [24]. Nevertheless, an spin ice monopole interpretation is highly useful to\ndescribe excited states in frustrated spin systems from the viewpoint of spin liquid.\n\nD.\n\nMonopole in topological insulator\n\nRecent study revealed that monopole arises at the surface of topological insulators as a\nresult of a image magnetic charge when an electric charge is close to a surface according\nto the following mechanism [30, 31]. A surface of topological insulator is described by a\nmassless Dirac Hamiltonian in (2+1) dimensions. In this system, a parity anomaly arises\nfrom a ultra violet divergence, resulting in a Hall current perpendicular to the applied field\nj\u03bc =\n\ne2 m X \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\u01eb \u2202\u03bd A\u03c1 ,\n2h|m| \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\n(21)\n\nwhere A represents an vector potential and m is a topological mass [32]. An electric charge\nemitting a radial electric field outside a topological insulator thus creates a circulating electric\ncurrent on the surface. A magnetic field generated by this current is equivalent to the one\nemitted by a magnetic charge inside topological insulator. Therefore, electric charge in a\nproximity with a topological insulator is coupled with a mirror magnetic charge (monopole),\n13\n\n\fforming a state called a dyon. This coupling of electric and magnetic charges is explained\nalso by an effective Lagrangian of a topological insulator in three space dimensions (called\na \u03b8 term) [30]\n\u03b8\nL\u03b8 =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd3 xE * B,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a constant. This Lagrangian, derived by integrating out the electrons, indicates\nthat electric field and magnetic field are coupled directly, i.e., there is a magneto-electric\neffect. Lagrangian L\u03b8 is written as a surface integral, and reduces to a Lagrangian which\ndescribes a parity anomaly in (2+1) dimensions.\n\nV.\n\nHEDGEHOG MONOPOLE IN FERROMAGNETS\nA.\n\nGauge field representation of ferromagnetic metals\n\nIn this section, we derive a hedgehog monopole in a metailic ferromagnet in a strongly\nspin-polarized case. There are conduction electrons and local spins (magnetization). Local spin we consider is a classical vector field, represented by S(r, t), which depends on\nspace coordinate, r, and time, t. We use a field (second-quantized) representation, where\nc \u2261 (c+ , c\u2212 )t (lower index \u00b1 denotes spin and t stands for transpose) and c\u2020 represent the\nannihilation and creation operators for a conduction electron, respectively. The free part of\nconduction electron Hamiltonian is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n~2 2\n3 \u2020\n\u2207 \u2212 \u01ebF c,\nH0 = d rc \u2212\n2m\n\n(23)\n\nwhere m is the electron mass and \u01ebF is the Fermi energy. In metallic ferromagnets, conduction electrons are spin-polarized by local spin, S, due to a coupling of sd-type given\nby\nHsd = \u2212J\n\nZ\n\nd3 rS * (c\u2020 \u03c3c),\n\n(24)\n\nwhere J is a coupling constant, and (c\u2020 \u03c3c) is the spin density of the electron (\u03c3 = \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z\nrepresents Pauli matrix). The total Lagrangian of conduction electrons, defined as L \u2261\nR 3\nd ri~c\u2020 \u010b \u2212 H, where H = H0 + Hsd , is\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 2\nZ\n~\n2\n\u2020\n\u2020\n3\n\u2020\n|\u2207c| \u2212 \u01ebF c c + Mn * (c \u03c3c) ,\n(25)\nL = d r i~c \u010b \u2212\n2m\n14\n\n\fwhere M \u2261 JS and n \u2261 S/S is a unit vector. In ferromagnetic metals, spin polarization of\nconduction electron satisfies M\u03c4 /~ \u226b 1, where \u03c4 is elastic lifetime of conduction electron.\nThis is the adiabatic condition for disordered metals[8, 33, 34]. In this limit, a local gauge\ntransformation to choose the electron spin quantization axis along S(r, t) at each point is\nuseful [33]. The deviation from perfect adiabaticity is then described by an SU(2) gauge\nfield, which is small and we treat it perturbatively. A new electron operator a \u2261 (a+ , a\u2212 )t\nis defined as\nc(r, t) \u2261 U(r, t)a(r, t),\n\n(26)\n\nwhere U is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix which we further define as\nU(r, t) \u2261 m * \u03c3,\n\n(27)\n\nm being a real three-component unit vector we will define later. The matrix satisfies U 2 = 1,\ni.e., U(r, t)\u22121 = U(r, t). A derivative of an operator c reads\n\u2202\u03bc c(r, t) = U(r, t)(\u2202\u03bc + U(r, t)\u22121 \u2202\u03bc U(r, t))a = U(r, t)(\u2202\u03bc + iAs,\u03bc )a,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere a gauge field (represented by a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix) is defined as\nAs,\u03bc \u2261 \u2212iU(r, t)\u22121 \u2202\u03bc U(r, t).\n\n(29)\n\nIn terms of spin components, A\u03bc is written as [33]\nX\nAs,\u03bc = (m \u00d7 \u2202\u03bc m) * \u03c3 \u2261\nA\u03b1s,\u03bc \u03c3\u03b1 .\n\n(30)\n\n\u03b1\n\nBy the above gauge transform, the electron spin is transformed to be\nU \u22121 \u03c3U = 2m(m * \u03c3) \u2212 \u03c3.\n\n(31)\n\nThe aim of our gauge transform is to let this spin to be along z-axis, i.e., U \u22121 (n * \u03c3)U = \u03c3z .\nThis is satisfied if we choose\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nm = sin cos \u03c6, sin sin \u03c6, cos\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere (\u03b8, \u03c6) are the polar coordinates of S.

This is easily seen by noting that a unit\nvector n is described by two independent angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6, and that three vectors \u2202i n, \u2202j n\nand \u2202k n in Eqs. (49) and (51) cannot be independent. Nevertheless, the volume integral of\nthe monopole density is finite due to the surface contribution if the local spin has a hedgehog\nstructure shown in Fig. 4. Let us define a normalized spin gauge field including a copling\nconstant\n\ng\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nAN\n\u03bc \u2261\n\ni.e., as (upper suffix N means north)\ng\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6.\n4\u03c0\n\n(53)\n\nThe effective magnetic field of AN reads\ng X\n\u01ebijk n * (\u2207j n \u00d7 \u2207k n).\nB N i \u2261 (\u2207 \u00d7 AN\n)\n=\n\u03bc i\n8\u03c0 jk\n18\n\n(54)\n\n\fThe total magnetic flux is then\nZ\ndS * B N = gn,\n\n(55)\n\nmeaning that there are n monopoles with a charge g. Here we used a relation\nXZ\nXZ\ndSi \u01ebijk sin \u03b8(\u2207j \u03b8)(\u2207k \u03c6) = 8\u03c0n,\ndSi \u01ebijk n * (\u2207j n \u00d7 \u2207k n) = 2\n\n(56)\n\nijk\n\nijk\n\nwhere n is an integer. This is understood by noticing that sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6 is an element of are\nP R\nof a sphere spanned by \u03b8 and \u03c6, and thus an integral ijk dSi \u01ebijk sin \u03b8(\u2207j \u03b8)(\u2207k \u03c6) is a\nsolid angle of a sphere (4\u03c0) times a winding number of spin structure, an integer n. This\n\nrelation is a result of a fact that the total solid angle subtended by a spin structure is 4\u03c0n,\nor equivalently a fact that the left-hand side of Eq. (56) is a winding number multiplied\nby 8\u03c0. The hedgehog monopole from the spin structure is thus a topological object having\nvanishing local densities. The one shown in Fig. 4 has a topological number of n = 1.\nA quantization of monopole charge g is discussed by requiring that a gauge field covering\nthe whole space without singularity is constructed by patching together locally defined gauge\nfields. In fact, Eq. (53) is not defined at \u03b8 = \u03c0 (south pole), since \u2202\u03c6 can not be defined\nthere. We can define a gauge field regular at the south pole as\nAS\u03bc = \u2212\n\ng\n(1 + cos \u03b8)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6.\n4\u03c0\n\n(57)\n\nThis field has a singularity at the north pole \u03b8 = 0, but represents the same magnetic field\nas Eq. (54). We can define therefore only a gauge field with a singularity, if we try to\ndescribe the whole space by a single gauge field. The singularity is regarded as a Dirac's\nstring. Instead, we can cover the whole space by patching two gauge fields, AS\u03bc and Eq. (53),\nwhich we call AN\n\u03bc . They are related by a gauge transformation\n~ \u22121\nS\nAN\n\u03bc = A\u03bc + i \u0398 \u2202\u03bc \u0398,\ne\n\n(58)\n\nwhere\neg\n\n\u0398 \u2261 e\u2212i h \u03c6 ,\n\n(59)\n\nis a gauge transform function. This function must be single valued, i.e., is invariant under\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + 2\u03c0. Thus a condition\neg = 2\u03c0h,\n\n(60)\n19\n\n\fis imposed, which is a Dirac's quantization condition (Eq. (15)).\nMechanism of generation of a hedgehog monopole is essentially the same as a GUT\nmonopole, namely, a symmetry breaking of a non-Abelian gauge field (SU(2) for a hedgehog\nand SU(5) for GUT). There is, however, a difference in the two models. A GUT monopole\nis a composite object of a gauge field and a Higgs field, and the monopole solution is solved\nin the same footing as a Higgs field. In a case of hedgehog monopole, in contrast, local spin\nstructure is treated as a background field which is treated as not to be affected by gauge\nfield.\nThe effective magnetic field of a hedgehog monopole configuration, Eq. (46), is sometimes\ncalled the spin Berry's phase, and the electric field is known as the spin motive force [8].\nThe magnetic field has been observed for example in the anomalous Hall effect [17], and the\nelectric field has been observed by inducing magnetization dynamics such as domain wall\nmotion [15]. These experiments do not, however, mean existence of hedgehog monopole,\nsince as explained in \u00a7IV.\n\nD.\n\nHedgehog monopole in weak exchange coupling regime\n\nUntil very recently, a hedgehog monopole has been discussed exclusively in the adiabatic\n(strong sd coupling) regime. As we have discussed in the earlier sections, a symmetry\nbreaking of spin SU(2) space to a U(1) space of electromagnetism is clearly defined in\nthis regime. However, hedgehog monopole is not an object restricted to adiabatic regime.\nIn fact, introduction of an exchange interaction to rotationally invariant spin results in a\nsymmetry breaking even if the interaction is weak. In this section, we will demonstrate\nthat the hedgehog monopole emerges even if the exchange coupling J is small following the\nanalysis in Ref. [35]. We cannot approach monopoles in this regime by a standard gauge\nfield argument. Here we apply instead a novel method pointed out in Ref. [10, 35] based on a\ntransport calculation. In a transport method, effective electromagnetic fields are calculated\nby evaluating electric charge density and current density induced by local spin structure\nby use of Keldysh Green's functions. A monopole field is then identified by deriving the\nMaxwell's equation for the effective fields.\nWe consider a disordered metal, and take account of the spin-independent impurity scat20\n\n\ftering represented as\nZ\nHi = d3 rc\u2020 vi c,\n\n(61)\n\nvi being the impurity potential. In the following calculation, the impurities are approximated\nas random point scatterers and the averaging is carried out as\nhvi (r)vi (r \u2032 )ii = ni u2i \u03b4 3 (r \u2212 r \u2032 ),\n\n(62)\n\nwhere ni and ui are the impurity concentration and the strength of the scattering, respectively [36]. The impurities give rise to an elastic lifetime for the electron, \u03c4 , which is\ncalculated as\n\u03c4=\n\n~\n,\n2\u03c0ni u2i \u03bd\n\n(63)\n\n(\u03bd is the density of states per volume). The total Hamiltonian discussed in this section is\nH = H0 + Hi + Hsd .\n\n(64)\n\nThe electric charge density is\n\u03c1(r, t) = \u2212etrhc\u2020 (r, t)c(r, t)i,\n\n(65)\n\nwhere the bracket represents the quantum expectation value and tr is a trace over spin\nindices, and electric current density is given as\nji (r, t) =\n\ne~2\n(\u2207r \u2212 \u2207r\u2032 )i trG< (r, t; r \u2032 , t)\n2m\n\nr \u2032 =r\n\n,\n\n(66)\n\nwhere\n\u2032 \u2032\nG<\ns,s\u2032 (r, t; r , t ) \u2261\n\ni \u2020 \u2032 \u2032\nhc \u2032 (r , t )cs (r, t)i,\n~ s\n\n(67)\n\n(s and s\u2032 are spin indices) is the lesser component of the non-equilibrium Green's function\n[37].

(82) differ from the strong coupling limit. It is notable that the structure\nof the electromagnetism, i.e., U(1) gauge field, (and further, that with monopole in the\npresent case) is embedded in the electron transport phenomena.\nWe note here that the definition of Eh , Bh , \u03bc according to Eq. (74) and the dielectric\nconstant \u01eb according to the Gauss's law has arbitrariness. In fact, the condition imposed\nby the transport properties (j and \u03c1) is not sufficient to fix the two effective fields uniquely,\nand an additional condition seems to be required. Nevertheless, existence of monopole holds\ntrue; both of the monopole current and density cannot be deleted at the same time by\nredefining the fields. Further, as noted in Ref. [35], the product \u01eb\u03bc is invariant; a physical\nquantity of the velocity of the effective topological electromagnetic field is uniquely given as\n1\n~\n1\nvtop \u2261 \u221a = \u221a\n.\n\u01eb\u03bc\n8 30 kF \u01ebF \u03c4 2\n\n(83)\n\n~kF \u03c4\n,\nm\n\nis 10\u00c5, \u01ebF \u03c4 /~ = 3.3 by choosing kF \u22121 = 1.5\u00c5, the speed\n\nIf elastic mean free path, l \u2261\n\nof the topological electromagnetic wave is thus rather large, about 900m/s. The topological\nelectromagnetic field may be useful to transport spin information in a different manner from\nmagnon transports.\n\nVI.\n\nSPIN DAMPING MONOPOLE\n\nAs we have seen, the hedgehog monopole is a topological object and has locally vanishing\ndensity and current only. The hedgehog monopole hence does not locally coupled to the\nelectromagnetism. Very recently, a novel monopole in magnets with locally finite density\nand current density was discovered by Takeuchi et al [10]. Such a monopole creates a\nrotational electric field via the Amp\u00e8re's law (Fig. 2), and thus it acts as an anomalous\nangular momentum source which induces rotational motion of electric charge. To realize\nsuch a monopole, Takeuchi et al. included the spin-orbit interaction.\nThe spin-orbit interaction exists in any elements including magnetic ones, and is particularly strong in heavy elements such as platinum and gold, and at the interfaces in junctions\nwhere the inversion symmetry is broken [38]. Two types of the spin-orbit interaction were\nthus considered in Ref. [10]. The first is the one from a uniform field, ER , namely the\nRashba interaction [39]. Such a field is realized at the interfaces and surfaces. The Rashba\n24\n\n\finteraction in metallic films recently turned out to be particularly useful for current-driven\nmagnetization switching [40, 41]. The second is the one from a random potential, vi , induced\nby heavy impurities. This random heavy impurity model would also simulate the effect of\nspin-orbit interaction in heavy pure metals. The total spin-orbit interaction thus reads\nZ\n1\nHso = \u2212\nd3 rc\u2020 [(\u03bbR ER \u2212 \u03bbi \u2207vi ) * (p \u00d7 \u03c3)] c,\n(84)\n~\nwhere p is the electron's momentum and \u03bb is a spin-orbit coupling constant (the subscript\nR and i characterize Rashba and impurity-induced ones, respectively). The interaction with\nthe magnetization is described by Hsd . The Hamiltonian of the present system is, therefore,\ngiven as\nH = H0 + Hi + Hsd + Hso .\n\n(85)\n\nThe electric current, j, generated in the system by magnetization dynamics is calculated by\nevaluating a quantum field theoretical expectation value of electron velocity operator,\nv\u0302 = \u2212(i~/m)\u2207 + (1/~)(\u03bbR ER \u2212 \u03bbi \u2207vi ) \u00d7 \u03c3.\nThe electric current thus reads\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012 2\n~\n<\n\u2032\n.\n(\u2207r \u2212 \u2207r\u2032 ) + i[\u03bbR ER \u2212 \u03bbi \u2207vi (r)] \u00d7 \u03c3 G (r, t; r , t)\nj(r, t) =e tr\n2m\nr \u2032 =r\n\n(86)\n\n(87)\n\nThis expectation value is evaluated by solving the following Dyson's equation,\nGss\u2032 (r, t; r \u2032, t\u2032 ) =\u03b4s,s\u2032 gs (r, t; r \u2032 , t\u2032 )\nZ\nZ\n3 \u2032\u2032\ndt\u2032\u2032 gs (r, t; r \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 )\n+ d r\nC\n\n\u00d7 (\u03b4s,s\u2032\u2032 vi (r \u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 JS(r \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ) * \u03c3ss\u2032\u2032\n+ i{[\u03bbR ER \u2212 \u03bbi \u2207vi (r \u2032\u2032 )] \u00d7 \u2207r\u2032\u2032 } * \u03c3ss\u2032\u2032 )\n\u00d7 Gs\u2032\u2032 s\u2032 (r \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ; r \u2032 , t\u2032 ).\n\n(88)\n\nThis equation is solved treating \u03bb and J perturabatively to the linear and second orders,\nrespectively.

The spin damping monopole is a composite object made\nfrom a magnetization configuration in the same manner as the hedgehog monopole. The\nmonopole satisfies the conservation law, \u03c1\u0307m + \u2207 * jm = 0.\n28\n\n\fA.\n\nRemarks on uniqueness of effective fields\n\nEquation (96) apparently contains an arbitrariness. In fact, one may think that a transformation Es \u2192 Es + (1/\u03c3c )\u2207 \u00d7 C and Bs \u2192 Bs \u2212 \u03bcC, where C is an arbitrary vector field,\nis possible without changing Eq. (96). However, such a transform is not allowed because of\na gauge invariance in the original space with a higher symmetry, as is known in the case of\nhedgehog monopole, where an SU(2) gauge invariance forbids this arbitrariness.\nValidness of our definition of Es and Bs in Eq. (93) is supported by the following\nargument. In Eq. (92), electron diffusion (D\u2207\u03c1) induces the effective electric and magnetic\npolarizations Ps and Ms , respectively. By using the relation\n(\u2212D\u22072 + \u2202t )\u03c1 = \u2212\u03c3c \u2207 * Es ,\n\n(99)\n\nthe electric current (eq. (92)) is described as the rotation of the magnetic field and the time\nderivative of the electric field,\nj = \u2207 \u00d7 Hs \u2212 \u1e0as ,\n\n(100)\n\nwhere Hs and Ds are the fields defined as\nHs \u2261\n\n1\nBs \u2212 Ms\n\u03bc\n\nDs \u2261 \u03b5Es + Ps ,\n\n(101)\n\nwith \u03b5 = \u2212\u03c3c \u03c4 being the permittivity, respectively. In Eq. (101), Es and Bs are naturally\nidentified with the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. By use of these fields, two of\nthe Maxwell's equations become\n\u2032\n\u2207 \u00d7 Ds + \u1e22s = jm\n\n\u2207 * Hs = \u03c1m .\n\n(102)\n\n\u2032\nHere jm\nis redefined monopole current, which is non-local.\n\nB.\n\nSpin damping monopole generation in a ferro-normal junction\n\nThe spin damping monopole is unique since it does not require a particular non-coplanar\nspin structure like a hedgehog, and so it exists quite generally in magnetic systems. The\n29\n\n\f\u03b8\n\nFIG. 13.\n\nSchematic illustration of monopole pumping and detection in a thin ferromagnetic\n\nfilm attached on a non-magnetic layer. Magnetization (S) precession is induced by applying an\noscillating magnetic field. The amplitude of presession is represented by an angle \u03b8. The Rashba\nfield, ER , exists at the interface and creates the monopole current, jm , near the interface. The width\nof the monopole current distribution, d, is comparable to the decay length of the magnetization\nat the interface. The monopole current induces an electric current, j, via the Amp\u00e8re's law at\nthe interface. The impurity spin-orbit interaction directly induces positive (+) and negative (\u2212)\nmonopole charge distribution, \u03c1m , at the two edges.\n\nsimplest candidate for creating the monopole would be a thin ferromagnetic film put on\na non-magnetic insulator or metal shown in Fig. 13. We choose the z axis perpendicular\nto the film. The Rashba-type spin-orbit field would then arise at the interface along the\nz direction [38]. We excite the precession of the uniform magnetization by applying the\nalternating magnetic field in the yz plane in the presence of static field along the x axis (ferromagnetic resonance [42]). The precession results in the spin damping vector with a finite\ntime average, N , along x direction. In the present case with the uniform magnetization,\nspatial derivatives in Eqs. (97) and (98) arise at the interface and at the edges, where the\nmagnetization vanishes. The Rashba interaction contributes to the DC monopole current\nat the interface as\nR = \u2212\u03b1 E\njm,x\nR R\n\n\u03b1R\n\u2202N\n\u2243 \u2212 ER N,\n\u2202z\nd\n\n(103)\n\nwhere d is the spatial scale of the magnetization decay at the interface. The monopole\ncurrent driven by the random spin-orbit impurities, on the other hand, vanishes when time30\n\n\faveraged. The total DC monopole current thus reads\n\u03b1R\njm = \u2212ex ER N,\n(104)\nd\n(ex represents the unit vector along the x direction). This monopole current at the interface generates the electromotive force along the y direction via the Amp\u00e8re's law for the\nmonopole. The monopole density induced by the random spin-orbit interaction arises at the\nedge of the ferromagnetic film since \u2207 * N \u2243 \u2202Nx /\u2202x is finite there. The induced monopole\ndensity at the two edges is\n\u03b2i\n\u03c1m = \u2213 N,\n(105)\nd\nwhere the sign is positive on one side of the edge and negative on the other side. The\nmonopoles then produces a magnetic field along the x direction as\nBs = \u2212ex \u03b2i N.\n\n(106)\n\nThis field creates the electric current in the y direction via the conventional Amp\u00e8re's law.\nThe averaged electric current density generated by the spin damping monopole [Eq. (92)]\nthus reduces to\n\u03b2i\n(107)\n)N .\n\u03bcd\nWe have thus found that when magnetization precession occurs in a metallic ferro-normal\nj = \u2212ey (\u03c3c \u03b1R ER +\n\njunction, a current of voltage arises perpendicular to the junction and a precession axis. As\nfar as electric detection concerns, a monopole effect appears qualitatively the same as an\ninverse spin Hall effect [12], which is a widely-used experimental method for spin current\ndetection. We will examine this important point later in \u00a7VII A.\nLet us look into the monopole signal quantitatively. We define energy scales of Rashba\nand impurity spin-orbit interactions as (kF is Fermi wavelength)\n\u03bbR 2\n\u2206R \u2261\nkF vR\ne\n\u2206i \u2261 \u03bbi kF 2 vi ,\nwhere vR \u2261\n\ne\nkF\n\n(108)\n\nER is a potential energy due to Rashba electric field, ER .

Rashba interaction strength is chosen\n\nas \u2206R /\u03b5F \u223c 0.1, considering an enhancement on the surfaces and the interfaces [43]. We\nassume for simplicity that\n\n1 \u2206i\nkF d vi\n\nis the same order of magnitude as\n\n\u2206R\n.\n\u01ebF\n\nWhen \u03b8 = 30\u25e6 and\n\n\u03a9 = 1 GHz, the electric current density is thus\n|j\u0304| = 1.6 \u00d7 109 A/m2 ,\n\n(111)\n\nwhich is sufficiently large for experimental detection. In addition to DC, there is AC component in Eq. (92) which would be accessible by a time-resolved measurement.\nThe current corresponds to an effective electric field, Eq.

We\nnote that \u03bc here is a permeability for effective magnetic field and can be different from the\none for ordinary magnetic field. For correct quantitative estimate, magnetic properties for\nthe effective magnetic field needs to be investigated further.\nThe monopole current, Eq. (97), is estimated to be\n|jm | \u2243\n\n|Es |\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 1011 V/m2 .\nd\n\n(114)\n32\n\n\fThis value, however, cannot be converted into usual dimension of current density, A/m2 ,\nsince permeability of the effective field is not known.\nWe note that the electric current estimated here is an initial current that arises when the\npumping of monopoles starts. When the monopole current is pumped steadily, the monopole\naccumulation grows at the edges of the system, inducing a diffusive current. The steady\nmonopole distribution is then determined by the balance of this backward diffusion and the\npumped monopole current.\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we have succeeded in proving existence of monopoles by deriving Maxwell's\nequation by a transport calculation in \u00a7V D and \u00a7VI. There remains, however, a few points\nto be clarified in the transport approach to spin damping monopole.\nFirst is a question whether spin damping monopole has a topological meaning or not. In\na case of hedgehog monopole, it was a topological object in three space dimensions, while\ntopological nature seems to be lacking in the expression of spin damping monopole density\n(Eq. (98)). What is crucially different in spin damping monopole is that it needs dynamic\nspins (\u1e60). Thus, if there is any topological meaning, it should be discussed in both space\nand time.\nSecond point is a gauge field representation of spin damping monopole. In a case of\nhedgehog monopole, it was obvious in the strong coupling limit. Even in the weak coupling\nlimit, it is straightforward to see from the effective fields (Eq. (77)) that the gauge field\ndescribing hedgehog monopole is AzS = 12 (1\u2212cos \u03b8)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 (defined in Eq. (33)). A quantization\ncondition for a monopole charge then arose naturally from the condition that a gauge field\ncan be defined to cover the whole space (Eq. (60)). In a case of spin damping monopole, an\neffective magnetic field in Eq. (93) cannot be written as a rotation of a local effective vector\npotential (because there is a monopole), but is represented by a nonlocal vector potential\nas Bs = \u2207 \u00d7 A(sd) + \u03a6, where (see Eq. (8))\nZ\nX\n(sd)\n\u01ebijk drj\u2032 Nk (r \u2212 r \u2032 ),\nAi (r) = \u2212\u03b2i\njk\n\n(115)\n\nL\n\nand \u03a6 represents a string singularity field. Based on this expression, the same argument\nas Dirac for a quantization condition [1] is valid, and thus the charge of a spin damping\n33\n\n\fmonopole g is quantized as in Eq. (15). In order to understand fully the origin of spin\ndamping monopole, it is important to study if the monopole is represented by patching two\nor more local gauge fields (see \u00a7V C). This would be carried out by studying a clean (\u03c4 = \u221e)\nand strong sd coupling limit.\n\nA.\n\nMonopole interpretation of the inverse spin Hall effect\n\nThe electromotive force discussed above is a result of the Maxwell's equation for the\nmonopole, which is an exact equation required by the gauge invariance. If one detects\nthe electromotive force given by Eq. (112), it becomes a direct evidence of spin damping\nmonopole. The electromotive force here acts on the spin of the electron, and thus can\nbe detected electrically as has been demonstrated [15]. Remarkably, the observation of\nspintronics monopoles might have already been achieved. In fact, the electric voltage due to\nthe magnetization precession has been observed in a system of ferromagnet on a Pt film [12]\nand the direction of the voltage was in agreement with our prediction from the monopole.\n(The spin-orbit interaction expected in Pt is an intrinsic one due to periodic atoms, but\nthe effect is expected to be the same as the one from the random potential. In addition,\ninterface Rashba interaction might also be there. Therefore the monopole scenario would\napply to the system in Ref. [12].) In Ref. [12], the mechanism for the voltage generation was\nargued to be the inverse spin Hall effect. According to the inverse spin Hall explanation, the\nmagnetization precession generates spin current via the spin pumping effect, and the spin\ncurrent, js , is converted into charge current by the spin-orbit interaction (the inverse of the\nspin Hall effect). This explanation assumes that the conversion mechanism of [44]\nji = \u03bb\n\nX\n\nk\n\u01ebijk js,j\n,\n\n(116)\n\njk\n\nwhere \u03bb is a constant representing the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and k is the index\nfor the spin polarization of the spin current. This formula is, however, physically incorrect.\nIn fact, the charge current is a conserved quantity, while the spin current is not because of\nthe spin relaxation, and thus these two currents should not be simply proportional to each\nother. To put in other words, spin current does not have a unique definition because of its\nrelaxation, and thus is not physical. A spin current explanation is therefore an approximate\none which might be justified only at very short distance (less than the spin relaxation length).\n34\n\n\fIndeed, it has been theoretically demonstrated that that conversion formula is not satisfied\nin a case of slowly varying magnetization configuration [45]. In contrast to the spin current\nscenario, our monopole scenario is a result of Maxwell's equations, required by a symmetry\nof the electromagnetism. Since monopole is a conserved quantity satisfying \u03c1 \u0307m + \u2207 * jm = 0,\nmonopole scenario is based on a relation between physical quantities, the electric field and\nmonopole. Our scenario therefore explains the \"inverse spin Hall effect\" free from ambiguity,\nin contrast to the spin current one.\nFor experimental confirmation of the spin damping monopole, of crucial importance is\nthe separation of the monopole signal from the inverse spin Hall signal driven by the spin\ncurrent. This is accomplished by applying an effective electric field perpendicular to the\njunction of Fig. 13. The monopole contribution then leads to the transverse electric current\nas a result of the Hall effect for the monopole, while the contribution of the spin current is\nnot affected.\nObservation of the effective magnetic field emitted by monopoles, Eq. (93), by use of\nmuons or neutrons or electron holography would be also a direct evidence of monopole\ngeneration.\n\nB.\n\nRemarks on spin current\n\nOur analysis has also proved that the spin current does not modify the fundamental law\nof electromagnetism, namely Maxwell's equations. Historically, there have been arguments\nthat the spin current would create the electromotive force by a modified Amp\u00e8re's law based\non the assumption that the spin current is equivalent to the flow of two monopole charges\n[46]. Quantum mechanics tells us that this idea is too naive, since the spin is a point object\nand thus the separation between the magnetic charges are strictly zero, even if one dares\nto interpret spin by two magnetic charges. The monopole current associated with the spin\ncurrent is therefore absolutely zero. In fact, spin current is a quantity in an SU(2) spin\nspace which couples to the electromagnetism only when properly projected, and since we\nknow from the argument by Volovik [9] that the projection in the adiabatic limit gives rise\nonly to a hedgehog monopole current but not the spin current. Our study has proved that\nthe correct projection of the magnetic systems with the spin-orbit interaction introduces a\nmagnetic monopole in electromagnetism.\n35\n\n\fVIII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAs we have discussed, magnetic monopoles are common objects in solids; they emerge in\nferromagnetic metals from topological spin structures and from dynamic spin (magnetization) with damping. Although monopoles have been discussed so far based on a gauge theory,\nwe have presented a novel method to access monopoles based on a transport calculation.\nIn monopoles in ferromagnets, of particular interest are spin damping monopoles, generated in a simple system of a ferromagnet and heavy metal. They open a novel path for\nconnecting magnetism and electronics via an analog of Amp\u00e8re's law. A novel concept of\nmonopolotronics, control of monopoles, proposed in Ref. [10], is expected to be useful for\nrealizing next generation spintronic devices.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to N. Kitazawa for discussion.

We follow the convention used in Ref. [7]. Contravariant vectors,\nsuch as x\u03bc = (t, x, y, z), are represented by the upper indices. Covariant vectors, represented by lower indices, are defined by multiplying the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd as, for example,\nx\u03bc = g\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bd , where\n\uf8eb\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \u22121 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec 0 0 \u22121 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0 0 0 \u22121\n\n(A1)\n\n36\n\n\fThus covariant vector of the 4-dimensional coordinate is thus x\u03bc = (t, \u2212x, \u2212y, \u2212z). The\nproduct of the covariant vector and contravariant vector is a Lorentz invariant scalar, e.g.,\nx\u03bc x\u03bc = t2 \u2212r 2 . (Note that we use relativistic notation only in this section. In other sections,\nupper and lower indices of the three-dimensional vectors means the same.)

A spin\ndynamics is induced by magnetic field. An equation of motion for a spin is thus generally\ngiven by Landau-Lifshitz equation\n\u1e60 = \u03b3Btot \u00d7 S,\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is gyromagnetic ratio and Btot represents the total magnetic field acting on S.\nBtot thus includes an external magnetic field, an internal field due to exchange interaction\nwith other localized spins, magnetic anisotropy field, and also the effect of coupling to other\ndegrees of freedom such as conduction electrons and phonons.\nWe know that damping or dissipation arises in general from a coupling to an environment, namely, other degrees of freedom. In a case of spins in metallic magnets, most strong\nsource of dissipation is conduction electron. Dissipation in this case is caused by spin-orbit\ninteraction, which converts spin angular momentum into orbital angular momentum. Therefore, damping effect is calculated by evaluating an effective magnetic field from conduction\nelectrons, resulting in [47]\n\u03b3Bel = \u2212\u03b1\u1e60,\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant proportional to the spin-orbit interaction. The damping torque is\nthus represented by \u03b1S \u00d7 \u1e60, called the Gilbert damping term. The equation of motion thus\nreads\n\u1e60 = \u03b3B \u00d7 S + \u03b1S \u00d7 \u1e60,\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere B \u2261 Btot \u2212 Benv is the field neglecting the effect of the environment, Benv . Equation\n(B3) is called Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.\nThe effect of Gilbert damping torque is understood by looking into Fig. 12. In fact, a\nvector S \u00d7 \u1e60 \u2261 N tends to point the spin perpendicular to its precession direction, i.e., to\nthe equilibrium direction along the field B, and hence \u03b1N represents the spin dissipated by\nthe environment.\n\n[1] P.
