For the case of linear boundary\ncondition, it is shown that the usual canonical quantization can be applied systematically.\n\narXiv:hep-th/0111005v3 8 Nov 2001\n\nPACS numbers: 11.10.Ef, 11.10.Kk\n\nQuantization of classical field in the presence of various\nboundary conditions is an old problem for which a systematical solution is still missing. This problem is important because it is related to a vast range of physical problems including, e.g. surface effect in condensed matter\nphysics, cavity QED, Casimir energy, two-dimensional\nintegrability [9, 10, 11, 12], mass generation [13, 14] and\nespecially conformal field theory and open string theory . Recently, there has been a renewed interests in\nthis problem among string theorists since the discovery\nof D-branes, noncommutativity and other extended objects (like the so-called Horizontal branes [5]) in string\ntheory. In most recent papers on this subject, people are\ntempted to use the Dirac procedure [6] for constrained\nsystems to treat the inconsistency of Poisson structure\nwith the boundary condition [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, for\nat least several reasons we think that this treatment of\nboundary condition is not quite appreciated. First, since\nthe boundary condition is a constraint at a specific spacial point (or a spacial hypersurface if there are more than\none spacial directions) which is of functional measure 0\nin the space of field, the direct application of Dirac procedure necessarily fails because the standard definition\nof Dirac Poisson brackets in this case would involve the\ninverse of \u03b4(0), which could hardly be given any practical\nsense. An alternative way is to put the spacial direction\nwith the boundary into a lattice form and then implement the Dirac procedure. In this case the construction\nof Dirac brackets seems to make perfect sense [1, 2, 3, 4],\nbut, unfortunately, there seems to be no simple continuum limit for such lattice regularized theories for which\nthe Dirac brackets remain consistent. More over, the appearance of an explicit length scale \u2013 the lattice spacing \u2013\nis another drawback of this formalism, which is especially\nunfavorable in scale invariant theories.\nIn this article, we shall propose a new method to treat\nthe inconsistency between the boundary condition and\nthe canonical Poisson structure. Our treatment is in fact\na modified definition of the canonical structure according\nto the analysis of the causality and locality of the theory\nin the presence of boundary condition. For simplicity we\nshall consider only the simplest case of a single scalar field\nin (D+1)-spacetime dimensions, where the time direction\nand the first D \u2212 1 spacial directions are boundaryless,\nand the only boundary condition appears in the direction\nof xD , which extends over [0, +\u221e).\n\nII\n\nI\nIII\n\nIII\nx\ny\nII\n\nI\n\nFigure 1: The lightcone\nBefore going into the concrete action level analysis, let\nus first analyze the causal structure of the scalar field\ntheory in the presence of a boundary. Figure 1 depicts\nthe (x0 , xD ) slice of the lightcone of the theory. Noticing\nthat the hypersurface xD = 0 is a reflecting barrier for\nlight signals, we have, in contrast to the case without\nboundaries, three different zones which are denoted as\nzone I, II and III respectively. Zone I and II are both\nlightlike, the difference is that zone I is a reflectionless\nzone which means that no signals of events happened in\nthe causal past y of the observer at x can be reflected from\nthe boundary to the observer, while events happened in\nzone II can be reflected without breaking the causality.\nZone III of the lightcone is the usual spacelike zone.\nTherefore, without knowing any details of the action, we\nmay conclude that the bare propagator of the scalar field\ntheory with such a lightcone must behave like\n\u2206B (x, y)\n\uf8f1\ny \u2208 zone\n\uf8f2 \u2206(x \u2212 y),\n= \u2206(x \u2212 y) + B\u2206(x \u2212 \u03c3(y)), y \u2208 zone\n\uf8f3 0,\ny \u2208 zone\n\nI\nII ,\nIII\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206(x \u2212 y) is the standard propagator for the same\ntheory in the bulk, \u03c3(y) is the reflection image of y with\nrespect to the boundary, i.e. if y = (y 0 , y 1 , ..., y D\u22121 , y D ),\nthen \u03c3(y) = (y 0 , y 1 , ..., y D\u22121 , \u2212y D ), and B is some operator which represents the effectiveness of the boundary\nreflection. For ideal reflection, we must have ||B|| = 1 (of\ncause the operator norm || || must be assigned a proper\nsense \u2013 we shall come back to this point later).\nNow let us write down the action of a single scalar\nfield \u03c6 with a bulk interaction V (\u03c6) and also a boundary\n\n\f2\ninteraction VB (\u03c6). It reads\nS[\u03c6]\nZ\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n=\ndD x\ndxD \u2202M \u03c6\u2202 M \u03c6 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 + 2gV (\u03c6)\n2\n0\nZ\nD\n+ \u03bbB\nd xVB (\u03c6)\n,\nxD =0\n\nR\nwhere throughout this article, dD x represents the integration over all the transverse spacetime directions to\nthe direction of xD , the Roman index M runs from 0\nto D, whereas the Greek index \u03bc runs from 0 to D \u2212 1.\nThe constants g, \u03bb respectively represent the strength of\nthe bulk and boundary couplings. As in the case of ordinary field theories without boundaries, the canonical\nconjugate momentum \u03c0(x) is still defined via the bulk\nLagrangian as\n\u03c0(x) =\n\n\u03b4L\n= \u22020 \u03c6(x).\n\u03b4\u22020 \u03c6(x)\n\n{\u03c6(x), \u03c0(y)} = \u03b4(x \u2212 y) + B(y)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03c3(y)),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere one should notice that \u03b4(x\u2212\u03c3(y)) is nonzero only if\nboth xD and y D are equal to 0, and B(y) is an operator\nacting on the variable y which represents the effect of\nboundary reflection. In this article, we adopt a slightly\nmodified definition for the \u03b4-function. We assume that\nZ \u221e\ndxD \u03b4(xD ) = 1,\n0\n\nor, in terms of the standard definition for \u03b4-function, our\n\u03b4(xD ) should be understood as lim\u01eb\u21920+ \u03b4(xD + \u01eb).\nNow let us check what form should the operator B(y)\ntake in order that the new Poisson bracket (4) be consistent.

Fortunately, since now the inconsistency only occur at the hypersurface xD = 0, we may\nexpect, following the principle of locality, that the modification to the naive Poisson brackets should be nontrivial only on the same hypersurface. Moreover, since\nthere is no dependence on the canonical momentum in\nthe boundary condition, only {\u03c6(x), \u03c0(y)} needs to be\nmodified. So, without loss of generality, we assume that\nthe correct {\u03c6(x), \u03c0(y)} take the following form,\n\n\u03b4V\n= 0,\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\n{G, \u03c0(y)}\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n\u03b4 2 VB\nD\nD\n=\ndx \u03b4(x ) \u2202D + \u03bb\n\u03b4\u03c62\n0\n\u00d7 [\u03b4(x \u2212 y) + B(y)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03c3(y))]\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03b4 2 VB\n\u03b4 2 VB\n= B(y) \u2202yD + \u03bb\n\u2212 \u2202yD \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03b4\u03c62\n\u03b4\u03c62\n\u00d7 \u03b4 (D\u22121) (x \u2212 y)\u03b4(y D ).\n2\n\n\u03b4VB (\u03c6)\n\u2202D \u03c6 + \u03bb\n=0\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nxD =0\n\nIn the last equality, \u03b4\u03b4\u03c6V2B is to be regarded as a function\nof y.

Noticing the fact that\nB(y) always acts on \u03b4(x\u2212\u03c3(y)), one may just denote \u2202yD\nas \u2202D .\nThe quantization of the above scalar field with boundary is still not an easy task because one still needs to\nassign proper meaning to the operator ordering and operator inverse appeared in the expression (5).\n\n\f3\nFortunately, there is a simple illuminating case in\nwhich one does not need to worry about the above problem, i.e. the case of linear boundary conditions. In this\nspecial case, one simply take VB (\u03c6) = \u2212 21 \u03c62 , and thus\nthe boundary interaction becomes just a boundary mass\nterm. The boundary condition (2) then becomes\n(\u2202D \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c6 = 0|xD =0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nand the operator B(y) is now\nB(y) =\n\n\u2202D + \u03bb\n.\n\u2202D \u2212 \u03bb\n\n(7)\n\nIn the rest of this article, we shall be considering the\nscalar field theory with this last boundary condition.\nTo quantize the theory with the boundary condition\n(6), one only needs to quantize the corresponding free\ntheory, i.e. the Klein-Gordon field with the boundary\n(6) and then apply the standard perturbation theory to\nintroduce the effect of the quantized interaction term :\nV (\u03c6) : in the bulk.\nLet us first write down the classical solution to the massive Klein-Gordon equation obeying the boundary condition (6):\n\u03c6(x) =\n\ndD\u22121 k\n(2\u03c0)D\u22121\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n0\nD\n\n\u03bc\ndkD 1\n\u221a [a(k)f (kD , xD )e\u2212ik\u03bc x\n2\u03c0 \u03c9k\n\u03bc\n\n+ a (k)f (kD , x )eik\u03bc x ]|\u03c9k =k0 ,\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere dD\u22121 k = dk1 ...dkD\u22121 . kD runs over [0, +\u221e) because the function\nD\n\nf (kD , xD ) = eikD x + B(\u2212ik)e\u2212ikD x\n\nD\n\nwith B(\u2212ik) being the Fourier image of our boundary\noperator B(y),\nB(\u2212ik) =\n\nikD \u2212 \u03bb\n,\nikD + \u03bb\n\nUsing this last expression and \u03c0(x) = \u22020 \u03c6(x), one can\nget the commutation relation for the momentum space\noperators \u00e2(k), \u00e2\u2020 (k),\n[\u00e2(k), \u00e2(k \u2032 )] = [\u00e2\u2020 (k), \u00e2\u2020 (k \u2032 )] = 0,\n[\u00e2(k), \u00e2\u2020 (k \u2032 )] = (2\u03c0)D \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 ),\n\u2032\nwith kD , kD\n\u2265 0. This is the Heisenberg type algebra\narisen in usual field theory restricted to the half momentum space kD \u2265 0. Therefore, we can use the Fock space\nfor ordinary Klein-Gordon field with the same restriction\nas the space of states for our theory. In particular, we\nhave the vacuum state |0i which is annihilated by \u00e2(k)\nand we choose the normalization for single particle states\nto be\n\nh0|\u00e2(k)\u00e2\u2020 (k \u2032 )|0i = (2\u03c0)D \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 ).\nFollowing the standard argument in quantum field theory (see, e.g. [15], we now can evaluate the propagator\n\n= \u03b8(x0 \u2212 y 0 )h0|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)|0i\n\n+ \u03b8(y 0 \u2212 x0 )h0|\u03c6(y)\u03c6(x)|0i,\n(8)\n\nNotice that f (kD , xD ) solves the equation (\u2202D \u2212\n\u03bb)f (kD , xD ) = 0|xD =0 . The (D + 1)-momentum k naturally satisfies the standard mass shell condition\nk 2 \u2212 m2 = 0.\nThe canonical quantization for the Klein-Gordon field\nis now accomplished by replacing the Poisson bracket\n{ , } by the equal-time commutator \u2212i[ , ],\n[\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)] = [\u03c0(x), \u03c0(y)] = 0,\n[\u03c6(x), \u03c0(y)] = i [\u03b4(x \u2212 y) + B(y)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03c3(y))] .\n\n\u03bc\n\n+ \u00e2\u2020 (k)f \u2217 (kD , xD )eik\u03bc x ]|\u03c9k =k0 .\n\nD(B) (x, y) \u2261 h0|T [\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)]|0i\n\nis complete over the half kD line,\nZ +\u221e D\ndk\nf (kD , xD )f \u2217 (kD , y D )\n2\u03c0\n0\n= \u03b4(xD \u2212 y D ) + B(y)\u03b4(xD + y D ).\n\nLet us remind that two special well-known cases are\nalready contained in this simple illustration, namely,\nthe Neumann boundary condition (which corresponds to\n\u03bb = 0 or B = 1) and Dirichlet boundary condition (for\nwhich \u03bb = \u221e or B = \u22121). Our result (9) agrees with the\nknown result [1] on these two special cases. For generic\nvalue of \u03bb, the relation B(\u2212ik)B \u2020 (\u2212ik) = 1 gives a simple explanation to the condition ||B|| = 1 mentioned earlier.\nNow, going to the momentum space representation,\none simply replaces the momentum space coefficients\na(k), a\u2217 (k) by their corresponding operators \u00e2(k) and\n\u00e2\u2020 (k),\nZ +\u221e\nZ\n\u03bc\ndkD 1\ndD\u22121 k\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u221a [\u00e2(k)f (kD , xD )e\u2212ik\u03bc x\n(2\u03c0)D\u22121 0\n2\u03c0 \u03c9k\n\n(9)\n\nwhich turns out to be\nZ +\u221e\nZ\ndkD\ndD k\nD(B) (x, y) =\n(2\u03c0)D 0\n2\u03c0\n\u03bc\ni\n\u00d7 2\nf (kD , xD )f \u2217 (kD , y D )e\u2212ik\u03bc (x\u2212y) ,\n2\nk \u2212 m + i\u01eb\nwhere the integration with respect to k0 is a contour integration over the complex k0 -plane which runs from \u2212\u221e\nbelow the real axis to k0 = 0, crossing the real axis and\ngoes to +\u221e above the real axis. Substituting the definitions of f (k, xD ), f \u2217 (k, y D ) into the last equation and\ntaking into account the relation (8), we get\nD(B) (x, y) = DF (x \u2212 y) + B(y)DF (x \u2212 \u03c3(y)),\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nwhere\nDF (x \u2212 y) =\n\nZ\n\nM\ndD+1 k\ni\ne\u2212ikM (x\u2212y)\n(2\u03c0)D+1 k 2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb\n\nis the standard Feynman propagator in D+1 dimensions.\nNotice that, following the standard discussion on the\ncausality properties of the Feynman propagator [15], we\nwould find that the result (10) agrees perfectly with our\nearly postulation (1). The propagator (10) is then the\nvery basic object in the Feynman rules of perturbation\ntheory for the interacting boundary scalar field theory\nwith generic interacting potential V (\u03c6) in the bulk.\nWe may also evaluate the retarded Green's function\nfor the boundary Klein-Gordon field as well. After some\nsimple calculations, we have\n(B)\n\nDR (x, y) \u2261 \u03b8(x0 \u2212 y 0 )h0|[\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)]|0i\n= DR (x \u2212 y) + B(y)DR (x \u2212 \u03c3(y)),\nDR (x \u2212 y) =\n\nZ\n\nM\ndD+1 k\ni\ne\u2212ikM (x\u2212y) ,\n(2\u03c0)D+1 k 2 \u2212 m2\n\nwhere the integration contour for k0 is taken to be running from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e above the real axis. The fact that\n(B)\nDR (x, y) is a green's function is now assured by the\nfollowing equation,\n(B)\n\n(\u2202M \u2202 M + m2 )DR (x, y) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y) + B(y)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03c3(y)).\nBefore finishing this article, let us make some more\ncomments on the commutation relation (9). Though by\ndefinition we know that the quantities \u03c6(x), \u03c0(x) live only\non the half space xD \u2265 0, we may, however, imagine to\nanalytic continue them to the whole spacetime.

The fact\nthat the consistent Poisson bracket between \u03c6(x) and\n\u03c0(y) depends on the second variation of VB with respect\nto \u03c6 makes the problem of canonical quantization in the\npresence of boundary a difficult task for generic VB . For\nlinear boundary conditions, i.e. for VB at most quadratic\nin \u03c6, the canonical quantization can be pursued without difficulties. Though we have obtained the consistent Poisson structure for generic boundary interaction\nVB depending only on the field \u03c6, we did not include\nmore generalities, i.e. the cases in which VB depends\nalso on spacetime derivatives of the field \u03c6, and the cases\nin which there are more than one scalar fields and VB\ncouples different components of the fields etc. It is also\ntempting to study the case when the fundamental field\nis is group-valued, like the principal chiral model studied in [10]. The direct quantization for generic VB is\nalso a fascinating subject (some progress for the case of\nsine-Gordon field with integrable boundary condition has\nalready been made in [11, 12]).\nWe thank M.
