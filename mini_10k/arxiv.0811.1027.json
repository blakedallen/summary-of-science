Just like any love story it cannot but be a tragic one. Full of happiness\nand despair, joy and sorrow. I believe a few words about this story are in order\nhere.\nThe story began with love at first sight, but it took many years for this to\nbecome a true love and develop into a somewhat steady relationship. This rather\nslow start is due to the circumstance that when I started with the current project\nI was rehabilitating from a previous similar love affair, and this made me hesitant\nand rather uncertain of how to proceed. But luckily, things changed. The great\nintellectual freedom I granted myself, and which was also made possible by the carte\nblanche handed to me at the beginning of the project, provided ideal circumstances\nfor falling in love, and thus for rediscovering the truth-lover inside of me. The\npresent dissertation stems from that love of truth \u2013 but this occurred not without\ndifficulty, be it mentioned.\nThe intellectual freedom may further explain the fact that this dissertation is not\nconcerned with a single research question, but with a handful of different, though\nrelated subjects, and also that my love produced many ideas, only some of which\nturned out to be promising, whereas many were in fact utter nonsense. The latter\nis not to be regretted for I am convinced that a love of truth can only really be\ncreative when it does not fear misfortune, nor mistake or confusion.\nI invite the reader to try and taste some of the fruits of this love. I believe \u2013\nand sincerely hope \u2013 that some may taste delicious, but I realize that others may\nvery well be rather bland and tasteless.\nWith these final words an episode has come to an end. Fortunately, the story\ncontinues - forever learning how to truly love.\nM.P. Seevinck\nNijmegen, September 2008\n\n\f\fAcknowledgements\nThis dissertation has benefitted from advice of a number of people, and many helped\nto complete it. I would like to take the opportunity here to express my thanks and\ngratitude to them.\nFirst of all, I am grateful to my co-authors and especially to Jos Uffink, together\nwith whom five papers have appeared. As regards the contents of this dissertation\nthe greatest debt by far is to Jos. Not only is Jos is responsible for getting me\ninterested in the foundations and philosophy of physics in the first place, he also\ntaught me most of what I know. As a dissertation adviser Jos was always available\nto sound out my arguments, sharpen my understanding of the pertinent issues, and\nstimulate me to express my ideas clearly. He never hesitated to share his insights\nwith me. Jos and I have worked together very closely for the past years and this\ngave me the opportunity not only to benefit from his clear thinking but also to learn\nfrom his great style of writing.\nI would also like to thank my promotor Dennis Dieks for being so patient with\nme and supporting me in many ways. I'm especially grateful for the editorial position with the journal Foundations of Physics that Dennis arranged for me and\nwhich allowed me to earn a living, while maintaining enough freedom to write this\ndissertation. I am further grateful to my colleagues in Utrecht, and especially to\nFred (F.A.) Muller for sharing numerous hotel rooms with me to cut down on costs\nas well as for greatly enhancing my interest in analytic philosophy and philosophy\nof science and for kindly helping me enter this academic field; to Jeroen van Dongen\nfor convincing me to write this dissertation at all; and to Remko Muis for being a\ngreat office mate during some long four years.\nThe willingness of Prof.dr. F. Verstraete (Vienna), Prof.dr. H.R. Brown (Oxford), Prof.dr. I. Pitowsky (Jerusalem), Prof.Dr. R.D. Gill (Leiden) and Prof.dr.\nN.P. Landsman (Nijmegen) to be my examiners and to accept this dissertation for\ndoctorate is appreciated with honour and gratitude.\nThanks are also due to various people with whom I had fruitful scientific correspondence and discussion to sharpen certain points of my analysis. I especially\nwant to thank Sven Aerts, Christian de Ronde, George Svetlichny, Chris Timpson,\nHarvey Brown, Jeremy Butterfield, Marek \u017bukowski, Geza T\u00f3th, Otfried G\u00fchne,\nHans Westman, Victor Gijsberts, Jon Barrett and N. David Mermin. Most of the\nwork described in this dissertation has already been published and I want to mention the anonymous reviewers of my papers for their valuable input, and the editors\nthat accepted my submissions for their efforts. And I extend my thanks to the\norganizers of the many conferences I attended, as well as to the audiences that were\npresent at the talks I presented for putting up with my ideas, which at that stage\nwere most likely only half-baked.\nxi\n\n\fI want to thank Klaas Landsman for a providing a pied a terre for me in the old\nscience building at the Radboud University Nijmegen. After that building had been\ndemolished Harm Boukema kindly gave me the opportunity to use his room at the\nPhilosophical Institute in Nijmegen for almost two years \u2013 sans papiers. Not only\nam I very grateful to him for providing me an office so close to home to work in, but\nalso for his inspiration and moral support. I also very much enjoyed the company\nof Luuk Geurts during the time I spent there on the 16th floor. In addition, I had\nthe opportunity to enjoy a very pleasant research stay at the Perimeter Institute\nin Waterloo, Canada. Their hospitality to host me as a short term visitor is very\nmuch appreciated, and I thank Owen Maroney for inviting me to come to PI in the\nfirst place.\nThe staff of the former physics library have helped tremendously in obtaining\nthe literature I requested. Nieneke Elsenaar deserves to be mentioned separately\nfor her amazing ability to find requested documents that cannot be found, and for\nan occasional cup-a-soup. Mentioning food, I must thank Tricolore for necessary\npizzas, Diavola con gorgonzola, which I have come to regard as the best of the\nNetherlands. Even more important for my physical well-being (except for the occasional injury) has been Obelix. They provided great and necessary stress relief on\nthe rugby pitch and amazing comradeship.\nI am grateful to my parents, family and friends. Jochem and Maarten deserve\nto be especially mentioned because of the gifts of great friendship; needed in general, but also in completing this dissertation. Special thanks to Wim.\nIt gives me great pleasure to dedicate this work to my beloved Tineke.

At one extreme,\none encounters metaphysical investigations that make use of some facts or ideas\ndelivered to us by modern physics, but that are not of a technical nature. At the\nother extreme, one finds almost pure mathematical investigations that might have\ntheir original motivation in some philosophical question on some aspect of modern\nphysics, but which in fact have as their sole purpose to clarify the structure of some\nphysical theory. Both sorts of enquiry are essential for grasping the foundations of\nphysics [Halverson, 2001, p. 1], though they are not sufficient. For this to be the\ncase, the results of both sorts of enquiry should meet somewhere and somehow.\nThese enquiries have been part and parcel of the foundations of quantum theory\nright from the beginning, for example in the writings of two founding fathers of the\ntheory: J. von Neumann and A. Einstein. Von Neumann gave quantum mechanics a\nmathematically rigorous structure whereas Einstein reflected upon the same theory\nin terms of philosophical questions about the nature of physical reality and on a\npriori requirements for doing any physics at all. Fortunately, the work of these\ntwo founding fathers met somewhere and somehow in the work of J.S. Bell when\nhe produced his 1966 and 1964 masterpieces1 . Two works that paved the way\nfor great progress in the philosophy of quantum mechanics. However, given the\nextreme sorts of enquiries that fall under the heading of philosophy of physics, as\nmentioned above, it is not surprising that some people in the field think Bell's work\nwas not mathematical enough, whereas others would want a more philosophical and\ninterpretational discussion. But despite the fact that indeed more formal rigor was\nneeded and more philosophy had to be done to fully appreciate Bell's insights, the\nspirit and style of Bell's work have been a leading example to me in writing this\ndissertation.\nTherefore, I expect that similar complaints as those raised against Bell's work\nwill also befall this dissertation. Some probably want more mathematics, others\n1 Bell cites in both these works von Neumann's monograph [von Neumann, 1932] as well as\nEinstein's autobiographical notes and reply to critics from the Schilp volume [Einstein, 1949].\n\n\f4\n\nChapter 1\n\nmore philosophy. However, with respect to the first, rest assured I will present sound\nresults, although I do not survey all mathematical aspects completely, and with\nrespect to the second, I give these results foundational and philosophical relevance,\nalthough probably some of the philosophical fruits still need to be reaped, something\nI would like to pursue in the near future. But above all, in cleaning up intuitive\nideas for mathematics I have striven for the right sort of balance of throwing only\nthe water out while keeping the baby inside.\n\n1.1\n\nHistorical and thematic background to this\ndissertation\n\nThis dissertation derives from a series of eleven articles I wrote over the last few\nyears, jointly authored with J. Uffink, G. Svetlichny, G. T\u00f3th, and O. G\u00fchne. Most\narticles have already appeared in print and they are listed at the end of this dissertation. What connects these articles and therefore the primary topic of this\ndissertation is, firstly, the study of the correlations between outcomes of measurements on the subsystems of a composed system as predicted by a particular physical\ntheory; secondly, the study of what this physical theory predicts for the relationships\nthese subsystems can have to the composed system they are a part of; and thirdly,\nthe comparison of different physical theories with respect to these two aspects. The\nphysical theories I will investigate and compare are generalized probability theories\nin a quasi-classical physics framework and non-relativistic quantum theory.\nThe motivation for these enquiries is that a comparison of the relationships\nbetween parts and wholes as described by each theory, and of the correlations\npredicted by each theory between separated subsystems yields a fruitful method\nto investigate what these physical theories say about the world. One then finds,\nindependent of any physical model, relationships and constraints that capture the\nessential physical assumptions and structural aspects of the theory in question. As\nsuch one gains a larger and deeper understanding of the different physical theories\nunder investigation and of what they say about the world.\nIndeed, many enquiries in physics that have provided us such understanding\nare of this sort2 , but many of the unresolved longstanding problems in physics\nare too3 . Here I will use a famous example of such a problem from the history\nof the foundations of quantum mechanics that allows me to introduce further the\nbackground to this dissertation. This problem was formulated in 1935 by Einstein,\nPodolsky and Rosen [1935] who considered a Gedankenexperiment (i.e., thought\n2 For example, Einstein's study of Mach's ideas about the origin of inertia and its alleged\nrelationship to the far-away stars that eventually culminated in his relativity theories; or the\nstudy of the behavior of a few-body system as predicted by deterministic non-linear dynamics\nthat gave rise to chaos theory.\n3 For example, the problem of how to account for the classical macro-world given the quantum\nmicro-world.\n\n\fIntroduction and overview\n\n5\n\nexperiment) that bears the by now famous name of 'the EPR argument'4 . They\nattempted to show that quantum mechanics is incomplete. The argument uses\na reductio ad absurdum (cf. Brown [1991, p. 141]) whereby the completeness of\nquantum mechanics can only be upheld if a form of non-locality or action-at-adistance exists between spatially separated and non-interacting quantum systems.\nThis is unacceptable, hence the claim must be false.\nThis argument was promptly countered by Bohr in a reply that is well-known\nfor its difficult and unclear reasoning, and which could even be read as a refusal to\naccept the problem. Nevertheless his argument effectively persuaded the majority\nof physicists \u2013 they went back to business \u2013 and this closed the classic era of debate\nand discussion between Einstein and Bohr. Bohr was declared the winner, resulting\nin nearly thirty years of silence where Copenhagen orthodoxy reigned5 . Another\nfactor responsible for this was von Neumann's 1932 proof of the 'no-go theorem' for\nintroducing a more complete specification of the state of a system than that provided\nby quantum mechanics [von Neumann, 1932]. It was thought by the majority at\nthe time that this proved the impossibility of so-called hidden variables in quantum\nmechanics once and for all6 .\nA new phase in the history of the foundations of quantum mechanics started in\nthe mid-1960s when Bell [1966] examined the von Neumann proof carefully to see\nwhat it had exactly established. He famously exposed its defect and also examined\nthe defects in other proofs that purported to have the same impact. In this review\npaper he also showed a contradiction for non-contextualist hidden-variable theories\ndescribing single systems associated with state spaces of dimension greater than\ntwo, thereby anticipating7 the more well-known Kochen-Specker theorem [Kochen\nand Specker, 1967]. Bell also showed in detail how Bohm's hidden-variable model\nof the early 1950s actually worked and how it circumvented the 'no hidden-variable\ntheorems': by being non-local, i.e., by incorporating a mechanism whereby the\narrangement of one piece of apparatus may affect the outcomes of distant measurements. He next went on to examine whether \"any hidden-variable account of\nquantum mechanics must have this extraordinary character\" [Bell, 1966, p. 452]).\nBell [1964] answered his own question positively by proving his by now famous in4 Often referred to as 'the EPR paradox', but this is a misnomer since no paradox whatsoever is\nproposed, but merely a sound Gedankenexperiment. Let us incidentally note that Einstein himself\nseems to have preferred a simpler Gedankenexperiment, but this discussion is not relevant for this\ndissertation. The full details of the EPR argument are not needed, the interested reader is directed\nto, for example, Bub [1997].\n5 A noteworthy exception is the important work by Bohm [1952] that Bell [1982, p. 990] later\nreferred to as:\"But in 1952 I saw the impossible done. It was in the papers by David Bohm.\"\n6 However, an interesting exception is Grete Hermann who published in 1935 an argument\nthat criticized a crucial assumption upon which von Neumann based his proof. The interested reader is directed to the English translation of her work which can be found at:\nhttp://www.phys.uu.nl/igg/seevinck/gretehermann.pdf. This criticism seems to have gone\nlargely unnoticed at the time. Thirty years later Bell [1966] criticized this same assumption\nof von Neumann, although using a different argument.\n7 For this reason Brown [1991] prefers to refer to this as the 'Bell-Kochen-Specker paradox'\ninstead of the 'Kochen-Specker paradox'; the latter being the term generally used in the literature.\n\n\f6\n\nChapter 1\n\nequality that was used to prove that any deterministic local hidden-variable theory\nmust be in conflict with quantum mechanics. (The 1966 paper was submitted before\nthe 1964 paper.) Brown [1991, p.141] puts this state of affairs strikingly as follows:\n\"The absurdum [i.e., a form of non-locality. MPS] can not be avoided, even when\nthe completeness thesis is relaxed and the possibility of 'hidden variables' of the\ndeterministic variety is entertained\".\nAfter the 1964 inequality variants of Bell's inequality were obtained that generalize his result that a local hidden-variable account of quantum mechanics is impossible, most notably the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality [Clauser\net al., 1969] and Clauser-Holt inequality [Clauser and Horne, 1974]. Then in 1981\nAspect et al. [1981] performed an experiment using photons emitted by an atomic\ncascade that many took as providing conclusive evidence for Bell's theorem because\nit showed a violation of the CHSH inequality, although it was soon realized that\nloopholes remained.\nIn the mid-eighties the plot thickened when Jarrett [1984] showed that two\nconditions together imply the factorisability condition (that Bell had called Local\nCausality) and which was used in deriving the CHSH inequality. Shimony [1986]\nused two related variants of the conditions that are now well-known under the name\nof Outcome and Parameter Independence. This carving up of the factorisability\ncondition led to a new activity under the name of experimental metaphysics were it\nwas argued that Outcome Independence should take the blame in violations of Belltype inequalities and that this was not 'action-at-a-distance' but merely 'passion at\nthe distance' (or because of some other newly devised metaphysical circumstance),\nthereby allowing for peaceful coexistence between relativity theory and quantum\nmechanics.\nA new line of research in the study of this 'quantum non-locality' was introduced\nin the late 1980's. Responsible for this was not sophisticated philosophical analysis\nbut further technical results in the study of what Schr\u00f6dinger [1935, p. 823] had\ncalled Verschr\u00e4nkung back in 1935 in his reply to the EPR paper and which we\nnow know as quantum entanglement. It had long been realized that these 'spooky\ncorrelations'8 are responsible for violations of Bell-type inequalities and they were\nphilosophically interpreted to be of a holistic character where the whole is more\nthan the sum of the parts [Teller, 1986, 1987, 1989; Healey, 1991]. But it turned\nout that much of the structure and nature of entanglement was still to be discovered.\nIndeed, only as late as 1989 Werner gave the general definition of this concept as we\nuse it now [Werner, 1989]. He also obtained the surprising result that local hiddenvariable models exist for all measurements on some entangled bi-partite states.\nIn the same year a new type of Bell-theorem appeared: the so-called GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger argument against local hidden-variable theories [Greenberger et al.,\n1989, 1990]. It uses a three-partite entangled state and used only perfect correlations\nnot needing a Bell-type inequality. Inspired by this result Mermin [1990] derived the\n8 In a letter to M. Born dated March 3rd 1947 Einstein [1971, p. 158] first coined the term\nspukhafte Fernwirkungen for such correlations.\n\n\fIntroduction and overview\n\n7\n\nfirst multi-partite Bell-type inequality. Quantum mechanics violates this inequality\nby an exponentially large amount for increasing number of parties. These results\ninitiated a whole new field of study: that of entanglement and its relation to Belltype inequalities, both for bi-partite and multi-partite scenarios.\nA second line of research started at about the same time with the work of Bennett and Brassard [1984] and Deutsch [1985] who showed that quantum systems can\nbe used as remarkable computational machines, and a few years later Ekert [1991]\nshowed that violations of Bell-type inequality by entangled states can be used for\nquantum cryptography. This marked a paradigm change where entanglement was\nno longer seen as mysterious (e.g., some 'spooky correlation') but as a resource that\ncan be used for computational and information theoretic tasks. Using entanglement\none can perform many such tasks more efficiently than when using only classical\nresources, and some such tasks are even impossible when using only classical resources. Examples include quantum computation, superdense coding, teleportation\nand quantum cryptography (cf. Nielsen and Chuang [2000]).\nSince entanglement was central to both these new fields of research, we could\nwelcome the marriage between quantum foundations and quantum information theory in the 1990s. This marriage has produced a lot of fruitful offspring in the last\n15 years or so. It would be too much to discuss all of this, so I will only highlight\nthe new research themes relevant for this dissertation.\n(I) Bell-type inequalities have come to serve a dual purpose. Originally, they\nwere designed in order to answer a foundational question: to test the predictions of\nquantum mechanics against those of a local hidden-variable theory. However, these\ninequalities have been shown to also provide a test to distinguish entangled from\nseparable (unentangled) quantum states. This problem of entanglement detection\nis crucial in all experimental applications of quantum information processing. However, the gap pointed out by Werner between quantum states that are entangled and\nthose that violate Bell-type inequalities shows that violations of Bell-type inequalities, while a good indicator for the presence of entanglement in some composite\nsystem, by no means captures all aspects of entanglement. Popescu [1995] was the\nfirst to show that this gap could be narrowed by showing that local operations and\nclassical communication can be used to 'distill' entanglement that once again suffices to violate a Bell-type inequality. However, even today the gap has not been\nclosed completely. Therefore, entanglement has been studied via other means such\nas non-linear separability inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and many different\nkinds of measures of entanglement (see, e.g., the recent review paper by Horodecki\net al. [2007]).\n(II) There has been a renewed interest in the ways in which quantum mechanics\nis different from classical physics. This originated from the realization that in order\nto increase understanding of quantum mechanics, it is fruitful to distinguish it, not\njust from classical physics, but from non-classical theories as well. So one started\nto study quantum mechanics 'from the outside' by demarcating those phenomena\nthat are essentially quantum, from those that are more generically non-classical. I\n\n\f8\n\nChapter 1\n\nwill highlight three such investigations relevant for this dissertation:\n(i) The study of non-local no-signaling correlations. This research started with\nPopescu and Rohrlich's question \"Rather than ask why quantum correlations violate the CHSH inequality, we might ask why they do not violate\nit more.\"[Popescu and Rohrlich, 1994, p. 382]. Here one investigates correlations that are stronger than quantum mechanics yet that are still no-signaling\nand thus do not allow for any spacelike communication. Surprisingly, such\ncorrelations can violate the CHSH expression up to its absolute maximum.\nBut their full characteristics are still being investigated.\n(ii) The study of the classical content of quantum mechanics. For a long time\nit was thought that the question what the classical content of quantum mechanics is was answered by the distinction between separable and entangled\nstates: separable states are 'classical', entangled states are 'non-classical', and\nthe same was thought of the correlations in such states. However, not only is\nit unclear whether all entangled states must be regarded as non-classical (as\nwe have seen the correlations of some entangled states can have a local hidden\nvariable \u2013 and therefore arguably a classical \u2013 account) Groisman et al. [2007]\neven argued for 'quantumness' of separable states. For example, they show\nhow to obtain quantum cryptography using only separable states.\n(iii) Providing interpretations of quantum mechanics. In the last two decades we\nhave been witnessing a renewed interest in both improving existing interpretations of quantum mechanics as well as providing new ones. The results\nof the study of entanglement and quantum information theory play a great\nrole in this revival and two different kinds of interpretational study can be\ndistinguished.\nThe first kind deals with (i) investigating traditional interpretations such as\nmodal interpretations, Everett's many worlds interpretation and Bohmian mechanics, and (ii) providing new ones of a similar character such as so-called\nQuantum Bayesianism [Caves et al., 2007] and the Ithaca interpretation [Mermin, 1998a, 1999, 1998b].\nThe second kind has a different character and is best characterized as reconstruction of quantum mechanics [Grinbaum, 2007]. Reconstruction consists\nof three stages: first, give a set of physical principles, then formulate their\nmathematical representation, and finally rigorously derive the formalism of\nthe theory. As a result of advances in quantum information theory most of\nthese reconstructions have used information-theoretic foundational principles\nsuch as the Clifton-Bub-Halverson reconstruction [Clifton et al., 2003].\nIn this dissertation I will contribute to research in the areas mentioned above under\n(I) and (II). However, I will not provide a conclusive analysis in any of these areas;\nthis dissertation provides many new results, but it leaves us also with a lot of open\nquestions.\n\n\fIntroduction and overview\n\n1.2\n\n9\n\nOverview of this dissertation\n\nTo give the reader a better idea of what can be found in this dissertation, I will\ngive a short outline. In the next chapter, chapter 2, I will present the necessary\ndefinitions, concepts and mathematical structures that will be used in later chapters. Most importantly, the definitions of four different kinds of correlation (local,\npartially-local, no-signaling and quantum mechanical) are presented as well as tools\nthat will be used to discern them.\nThroughout this chapter it is more precisely indicated what technical results are\nto be found in this dissertation. Here a less technical overview is given that focuses\non the issues involved, as well as on the foundational impact of the results that will\nbe obtained. However, because, on the one hand I have not concerned myself with\none central question, but rather with many different topics within the same field,\nand on the other hand many new results have been obtained instead of a few major\nconclusions, this introduction must necessarily be rather brief and cannot go too\nmuch into depth.\nIn part II, I limit my study to systems consisting of only two subsystems where\nI consider correlations between outcomes of measurement of only two possible dichotomous observables on each subsystems. This is the simplest relevant situation;\nbut the structure of the correlations that one can find for such a scenario is far\nfrom being completely understood. Chapter 3 investigates the well-known CHSH\ninequality for such bi-partite correlations. I first review the fact that the doctrine\nof Local Realism with some additional technical assumptions allows only local correlations and therefore obeys this inequality. It is then shown that one can allow for\ndependence of the hidden variables on the settings (chosen by the different parties)\nas well as explicit non-local setting and outcome dependence in the determination of\nthe local outcomes of experiment, and still derive the CHSH inequality. Violations\nof the CHSH inequality thus rule out a broader class of hidden-variable models than\nis generally thought. Some other foundational consequences of this result are also\nexplored.\nFurther, the relationship between two sets of conditions, those of Jarrett [1984]\nand of Shimony [1986] is commented upon. Each set implies a certain form of\nfactorisability of joint probabilities for outcomes that is used in derivations of the\nCHSH inequality. It is argued that those of Jarrett are more general and more\nnatural. I furthermore comment on the non-uniqueness of the Shimony conditions\nthat give factorisability by proving that the conjunction of a third set of conditions, those of Maudlin [1994], suffice too. This has been claimed before, but since\nno proof has been offered in the literature I provide one myself. In order to be\nevaluated in quantum mechanics it is shown that the Maudlin conditions need supplementary non-trivial assumptions that are not needed by the Shimony conditions.\nIt is argued that this undercuts the argument that one can equally well chose either\nset (Maudlin's or Shimony's).\nThe non-local derivation of the CHSH inequality is compared to Leggett's in-\n\n\f10\n\nChapter 1\n\nequality [Leggett, 2003] and Leggett-type models, which have recently drawn much\nattention. The analysis and discussion of Leggett's model shows surprising relationships between different conditions at different hidden-variable levels. It turns\nout that which conditions are obeyed and which are not depends on the level of\nconsideration and thus on which hidden-variable level is taken to be fundamental.\nThis study is extended to also include the so-called surface level, where one does\nnot consider any hidden variables. I also investigate bounds on the no-signaling\ncorrelations in terms of Bell-type inequalities that use both product (joint) and\nmarginal expectation values. After showing that an alleged no-signaling Bell-type\ninequality as proposed by Roy and Singh [1989] is in fact trivial (it holds for any\npossible correlation), a new set of non-trivial no-signaling inequalities is derived.\nIn chapter 4 and 5 I consider many aspects of the CHSH inequality in quantum\nmechanics for the case of two qubits (two level systems such as spin- 21 particles).\nThis inequality not only allows for discerning quantum mechanics from local hiddenvariable models, it also allows for discerning separable from entangled states. In\nchapter 4, significantly stronger bounds on the CHSH expression are obtained for\nseparable states in the case of locally orthogonal observables, which, in the case of\nqubits, correspond to anti-commuting operators. Some novel stronger inequalities\n\u2013 not of the CHSH form \u2013 are also obtained. These new separability inequalities,\nwhich are all easily experimentally accessible, provide stronger criteria for entanglement detection and they are shown to have experimental advantages over other\nsuch criteria.\nChapter 5, the condition of anti-commutation (i.e., orthogonality) of the local\nobservables is relaxed. Analytic expressions are obtained for the tight bound on the\nCHSH inequality for the full spectrum of non-commuting observables, i.e., ranging\nfrom commuting to anti-commuting observables, for both entangled and separable\nqubit states. These bounds are shown to have experimental relevance, not shared\nby ordinary entanglement criteria, namely that one can allow for some uncertainty\nabout the observables one is implementing in the experimental procedure.\nThe results of these two chapters also have a foundational relevance because\nthese separability inequalities turn out to be not to applicable to the testing of\nlocal hidden-variable theories. This provides a more general instance of Werner's\n(1989) discovery that some entangled two-qubit states allow a local realistic model\nfor all correlations in a standard Bell experiment. In chapter 6 this discrepancy\nbetween correlations allowed for by local hidden-variable theories and those achievable by separable qubit states is shown to increase exponentially with the number\nof particles. It seems that the question what the classical correlations of quantum\nmechanics are, has still not been resolved.\nIn part III I extend the investigation to the multi-partite case which turns out\nto be non-trivial. Indeed, when making the transition from two to more than two\nparties, one finds that almost always an unexpected richer structure arises. Again\nI restrict myself to the simplest case of two dichotomous observables per party, but\nthis already gives a lot of new results.\n\n\fIntroduction and overview\n\n11\n\nChapter 6 investigates multi-partite quantum correlations with respect to their\nentanglement and separability properties. A classification of partially separable\nstates for multi-partite systems is proposed, extending the classification introduced\nby D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001]. This classification consists of a hierarchy of levels\ncorresponding to different forms of partial separability, and within each level various\nclasses are distinguished by specifying under which partitions of the system the state\nis separable or not. Partial separability and multi-partite entanglement are shown\nto be non-trivially related by presenting some counterintuitive examples. This asks\nfor a further refinement of the notions involved, and therefore the notions of a kseparable entangled state and a m-partite entangled state are distinguished and the\ninterrelations of these kinds of entanglement are determined.\nBy generalizing the two-qubit separability inequalities of chapter 4 to the multiqubit setting I obtain necessary conditions for distinguishing all types of partial\nseparability in the full hierarchic separability classification. These separability inequalities are all readily experimentally accessible and violations give strong criteria\nfor different forms of non-separability and entanglement.\nChapter 7 investigates correlations from a different point of view, namely\nwhether they can be shared to other parties. If this is not the case the correlations are said to be monogamous. This is a new field of study that is closely related\nto the study of monogamy and shareability of entanglement, although I show some\ncrucial differences between the two. Known results are reviewed, in particular that\nquantum and no-signaling non-local correlations cannot be shared freely, whereas\nlocal ones can. It is next shown that unrestricted correlations as well as partiallylocal correlations can also be shared freely. To quantify the issue, I study the\nmonogamy trade-offs on bounds on Bell-type inequalities that hold for different,\nbut overlapping subsets of the parties involved. I limit myself to three parties, but\nthis already yields many new results.\nChapter 8 returns to the task of discerning the different kinds of multi-partite\ncorrelations using Bell-type inequalities. In this chapter a new family of Bell-type\ninequalities is constructed in terms of product (joint) expectation values that discern partially-local from quantum mechanical correlations. This chapter generalizes the three-partite Svetlichny inequalities [Svetlichny, 1987] to the multi-partite\ncase, thereby providing criteria to discern partially-local from stronger correlations.\nThese inequalities are violated by quantum mechanical states and it can thus be\nconcluded that they contain fully non-local correlations. However, the inequalities\ncannot discern no-signaling correlations from more general correlations.\nPart IV deals with more philosophical matters. I consider the ontological status\nof quantum correlations. Chapter 9 uses a Bell-type inequality argument to show\nthat despite the fact that quantum correlations suffice to reconstruct the quantum\nstate, they cannot be regarded as objective local properties of the composite system\nin question, i.e., they cannot be given a local realistic account. Together with\nsome other arguments, this is used to argue against the ontological robustness of\nentanglement.\n\n\f12\n\nChapter 1\n\nChapter 10 is devoted to the idea of holism in classical and quantum physics. I\nreview the well-known supervenience approach to holism developed by Teller [1986,\n1989] and Healey [1991], and provide an alternative approach, which uses an epistemological criterion to decide whether a theory is holistic. This approach is compared\nto the supervenience approach and shown to involve a shift in emphasis from ontology to epistemology. Further, it is argued that this approach better reflects the\nway properties and relations are in fact determined in physical theories. In doing so\nit is argued that holism is not a thesis about the state space a theory uses. When\napplying the epistemological criterion for holism to classical physics and Bohmian\nmechanics it is rigorously shown that they are non-holistic, whereas quantum mechanics is shown to be holistic even in absence of any entanglement.\nPart V ends this dissertation with chapter 11 that contains a summary of the\nresults obtained and a discussion of a number of open problems and avenues for\nfuture research inspired by the work in this dissertation.\n\nTo the reader:\n(i) At the beginning of each chapter I list the article(s) on which that particular\nchapter is (partly) based. All these articles are listed at the end of this dissertation\non page 267.\n(ii) Chapter 11 gives a summary that can be read independently from the rest\nof the dissertation and also gives suggestions for future research. The prospective\nreader might want to consult this chapter since it gives a more detailed, though nontechnical introduction of the results obtained in this dissertation that supplements\nthe \u2013 perhaps somewhat short \u2013 introduction presented above.\n\n\fChapter 2\n\n13\n\nOn correlations:\nDefinitions and general framework\nThis chapter is in part based on Seevinck [2007b].\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this chapter we give the necessary background for discussing the technical results of this dissertation. We will present the definitions, notation and techniques\nthat will be used in later chapters, as well as several clarifying examples. We also\ndiscuss relevant results already obtained by others. Along the way we will take the\nopportunity to indicate more precisely than was done in the previous chapter what\ntechnical results are contained in later chapters. The foundational relevance of the\nresults will be discussed later. For conciseness and clarity of exposition we will for\nnow refrain from any interpretational discussion.\nWe start in section 2.2 by defining the different kinds of correlation that will be\nstudied, as well as several useful mathematical characteristics of these correlations.\nWe follow the approach by Barrett et al. [2005] and Masanes et al. [2006] in discussing the no-signaling, local and quantum correlations, and we will supplement\ntheir presentation with a new type of correlations, the partially-local correlations1.\nDiscerning these different kinds of correlations is in general a hard task. In section\n2.3 we will argue that Bell-type inequalities form a useful tool for this task. We\npresent a general scheme for describing such inequalities in terms of bounds on the\nexpectation values of so-called Bell-type polynomials. After discussing this scheme\nwe present the well-known bi-partite Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality [Clauser et al., 1969] as an example. This inequality discriminates some of the\n1 Tsirelson [1993] also distinguished most of these types of correlations (but not the partiallylocal ones). He called them different kinds of 'behaviors'. However, we will not follow his exposition.\n\n\f14\n\nChapter 2\n\nbi-partite correlations, but, as we will show, not all of them. We will then further\ncomment on the task of obtaining multi-partite Bell-type inequalities in order to\ndiscriminate the different types of multipartite correlations.\nWe next pay special attention to the issue of discriminating quantum correlations, because here the distinction between entanglement and separability of quantum states becomes relevant. In the bi-partite case we discuss the feature of separability and entanglement, and the (non-)locality of these states.\nLastly, in section 2.4 we discuss a possible pitfall connected to the use of Belltype polynomials for obtaining Bell-type inequalities. We trace the problem back\nto the fact that Bell-type inequalities always use different combinations of incompatible observables. This re-teaches an old lesson from J.S. Bell, namely, that one\nshould be extremely careful when considering incompatible observables, and not be\nlured into neglecting this issue because quantum mechanics deals so easily with incompatible observables via the non-commutativity structure that is part and parcel\nof its formalism.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nCorrelations\nGeneral correlations\n\nConsider N parties, labeled by 1, 2, . . . , N , each holding a physical system that\nare to be measured using a finite set of different observables. Denote by Aj the\nobservable (random variable) that party j chooses (also called the setting Aj ) and\nby aj the corresponding measurement outcomes. We assume there to be only a finite\nnumber of discrete outcomes. The outcomes can be correlated in an arbitrary way.\nA general way of describing this situation, independent of the underlying physical\nmodel, is by a set of joint probability distributions for the outcomes, conditioned on\nthe settings chosen by the N parties2 , where the correlations are captured in terms\n2 Here,\n\nand throughout, we conditionalize on the settings for simplicity. This brings with it a\ncommitment to probability distributions over settings, but all our probabilistic conditions can be\nreformulated without that commitment, see Butterfield [1989, p. 117]. Such a reformulation treats\nsettings as parameters and not as random variables. Only in a single instance, when discussing\nMaudlin's conditions in chapter 3, it is necessary to introduce a probability distributions over\nsettings.\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n15\n\nof these joint probability distributions3 . They are denoted by\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ).\n\n(2.1)\n\nThese probability distributions are assumed to be positive\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) \u2265 0, \u2200a1 , . . . , aN , \u2200A1 , . . . , AN ,\nand obey the normalization conditions\nX\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) = 1, \u2200A1 , . . . , AN .\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\na1 ,...,aN\n\nWe need not demand that the probabilities should not be greater than 1 because\nthis follows from them being positive and from the normalization conditions.\nThe set of all these probability distributions has a nice structure. First, it is\na convex set: convex combinations of correlations are still legitimate correlations.\nSecond, there are only a finite number of extremal correlations. This means that\nevery correlation can be decomposed into a (not necessarily unique) convex combination of such extremal correlations.\nQN\nA total of D = i=1 mAi mai different probabilities exist (here mAi and mai are\nthe number of different observables and outcomes for party i respectively). When\nthese conditional probability distributions (2.1) are considered as points in a Ddimensional real space, this set of points forms a convex polytope with a finite\nnumber of extreme points which are the vertices of the polytope. This polytope is\nthe convex hull of the extreme points. It belongs to the subspace defined by (2.3)\nand it is bounded by a set of facets, linear inequalities that describe the halfplanes\nthat bound it. Every convex polytope has a dual description, firstly in terms of\nits vertices, and secondly in terms of its facets, i.e., hyperplanes that bound the\n3 We describe correlations in terms of the conditional joint probability distributions. An alternative way to study correlations is to consider a measure of correlation between random variables\ncalled the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient between two random variables x and\ny is given by the covariance of x andp\ny, cov(x, y) := h(x \u2212 hxi)(y \u2212 hyi)i, divided by the square\nroot of the product of the variances, var(x)var(y), with var(x) := hx2 i \u2212 hxi2 and analogously\nfor var(y). If the random variables are statistically independent their joint probability distribution\nfactorises, i.e., P (x, y) = P (x)P (y), and then cov(x, y) = 0, so the variables can be said to be\nuncorrelated.\nHowever, the correlation coefficient does not deal well with deterministic scenarios, since there\nthe variances and the covariance are always zero resulting in an ill-defined correlation coefficient.\nHowever, in a deterministic case the probabilities are either 0 or 1, and such deterministic scenarios\nare thus included in the joint probability formalism used here.\nIn quantum mechanics only non-product states (when expressed on a local basis {| ii\u2297| ji\u2297. . .})\nhave a non-zero correlation coefficient. These can however be pure. Indeed, a set of random\nvariables (observables) exists such that a pure entangled state always gives rise to a non-zero\ncorrelation coefficient for these random variables. Classically this is never the case. Pure classical\nstates correspond to points in a phase or configuration space and they give rise to deterministic\nscenarios where the correlation coefficient for any set of random variables is ill-defined.\n\n\f16\n\nChapter 2\n\npolytope uniquely. In general each facet can be described by linear combinations of\njoint probabilities which reach a maximum value at the facet, i.e.,\nX\n(2.4)\nca1 ,...,aN ,A1 ,...,AN P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) \u2264 I,\na1 ,...,aN ,A1 ,...,AN\n\nwith real coefficients ca1 ,...,aN ,A1 ,...,AN and a real bound I that is reached by some\nextreme points. For each facet some extreme points of the polytope lie on this facet\nand thus saturate the inequality (2.4), while the other extreme points cannot violate\nit. In general, when the extreme points are considered as vectors, a hyperplane is a\nfacet of a d-dimensional polytope iff d affinely independent extreme points satisfy the\nequality that characterizes the hyperplane4 . Consequently, for the case of general\ncorrelations (2.1) the set of extreme points that lie on a facet must contain a total of\nD affinely independent vectors. For this case the facets are determined by equality\nin (2.2). The probability distributions (2.1) correspond to any normalized vector\nof positive numbers in this polytope. For an excellent overview of the structure of\nthese polytopes, see [Masanes, 2002], [Barrett et al., 2005] and [Ziegler, 1995].\nThe extreme points are the probability distributions that saturate a maximum of the positivity conditions (2.2) while satisfying the normalization condition\n(2.3). They are characterized by Jones et al. [2005] to be the probability distributions such that for each set of settings {A1 , . . . , AN } there is a unique set of outcomes {a1 [A1 , . . . AN ], . . . , aN [A1 , . . . AN ]} for which P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) =\n1, with a1 [A1 , . . . , AN ] the deterministic determination of outcome a1 given the\nsettings A1 , . . . , AN , etc. There is thus a one-to-one correspondence between the\nextreme points and the sets of functions {a1 [A1 , . . . AN ], . . . , aN [A1 , . . . AN ]} from\nthe settings to the outcomes. Any such set defines an extreme point. The extreme points thus correspond to deterministic scenarios: each outcome is completely fixed by the totality of all settings and consequently there is no randomness\nleft: P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) = \u03b4a1 ,a1 [A1 ,...,AN ] * * * \u03b4aN ,aN [A1 ,...,AN ] . Finding all\nthe facets of a polytope knowing its vertices is called the hull problem and this is in\ngeneral a computationally hard task [Pitowsky, 1989]. The facet descriptions (2.4)\nwill be called Bell-type inequalities, and these will be further introduced later.\nThe marginal probabilities are obtained in the usual way from the joint probabilities by summing over the outcomes of the other parties. It is important to realize\nthat for general correlations these marginals may depend on the settings chosen by\nthe other parties. For example, in the case of two parties that each choose two\npossible settings A1 , A\u20321 and A2 , A\u20322 respectively, the marginals for party 1 are given\n4 In\n\ncase the null vector belongs to the polytope, the condition of the existence of d affinely\nindependent vectors is equivalent to the existence of (d\u22121) linearly independent vectors; otherwise\nit requires the existence of d linearly independent vectors [Masanes, 2002].\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n17\n\nby\nP (a1 |A1 )A2 :=\n\u2032\n\nP (a1 |A1 )A2 :=\n\nX\na2\n\nX\na2\n\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ),\n\n(2.5a)\n\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A\u20322 ),\n\n(2.5b)\n\nand analogously for setting A\u20321 and for the marginals of party 2. The marginal\n\u2032\nP (a1 |A1 )A2 may thus in general be different from P (a1 |A1 )A2 .\nWe will now put further restrictions besides normalization on the probability\ndistributions (2.1) that are motivated by physical considerations. We will here not\nbe concerned with arguing for the plausibility of these physical considerations, nor\nwhat violations of these physically motivated restrictions amounts to, but merely\ngive the definitions that will be used in future chapters. There we will comment on\nthe foundational content of the restrictions and their possible violations.\n\n2.2.2\n\nNo-signaling correlations\n\nLet us first consider the case of two parties that each choose two possible settings.\nA no-signaling correlation5 for two parties is a correlation such that party 1 cannot\nsignal to party 2 by the choice of what observable is measured by party 1 and\nvice versa. This means that the marginal probabilities P (a1 |A1 )A2 (see (2.5a)) and\nP (a2 |A2 )A1 are independent of A2 and A1 respectively:\n\u2032\n\nP (a1 |A1 )A2 = P (a1 |A1 )A2 := P (a1 |A1 ), \u2200a1 , A1 , A2 , A\u20322 ,\nA1\n\nP (a2 |A2 )\n\nA\u20321\n\n= P (a2 |A2 )\n\n:= P (a2 |A2 ),\n\n\u2200a2 , A1 , A\u20321 , A2 .\n\n(2.6a)\n(2.6b)\n\nIn a no-signaling context the marginals can thus be defined as P (a1 |A1 ), etc., i.e.,\nwithout any dependence on far-away settings.\nLet us generalize this to the multi-partite setting: a no-signaling correlation is\na correlation P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) such that one subset of parties, say parties\n1, 2, . . . , k, cannot signal to the other parties k \u2212 1, . . . , N by changing their measurement device settings A1 , . . . , Ak . Mathematically this is expressed as follows.\nThe marginal probability distribution for each subset of parties only depends on the\ncorresponding observables measured by the parties in the subset, i.e., for all outcomes ak+1 , . . . , aN : P (a1 , . . . , ak |A1 , . . . , AN ) = P (a1 , . . . , ak |A1 , . . . , Ak ). These\nconditions can all be derived from the following condition [Barrett et al., 2005]. For\neach k \u2208 {1, . . . , N } the marginal distribution that is obtained when tracing out ak\nis independent of what observable (Ak or A\u2032k ) is measured by party k:\nX\nP (a1 , . . . , ak , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , Ak , . . . , AN ) =\nak\n\nX\nak\n\nP (a1 , . . . , ak , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , A\u2032k , . . . , AN ),\n\n(2.7)\n\n5 We want to distinguish no-signaling from the impossibility of superluminal signaling, for the\nlatter requires a notion of spacetime structure whereas the first does not.\n\n\f18\n\nChapter 2\n\nfor all outcomes a1 , . . . , ak\u22121 , ak+1 , . . . , aN and all settings A1 , . . . , Ak , A\u2032k , . . . AN .\nThis set of conditions ensures that all marginal probabilities are independent of the\nsettings corresponding to the outcomes that are no longer considered6 . In particular,\n(2.7) the defines the marginal\nP (a1 , . . . , ak\u22121 , ak+1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , Ak\u22121 , Ak+1 , . . . , AN ),\n\n(2.10)\n\nfor the N \u2212 1 parties not including party k. No-signaling ensures that it is not\nneeded to specify whether Ak or A\u2032k is being measured by party k.\nThese linear equations (2.7) characterize an affine set [Masanes et al., 2006].\nThe intersection of this set with the polytope of distributions (2.1) gives another\nconvex polytope: the no-signaling polytope. The vertices of this polytope can be\nsplit into two types: vertices that correspond to deterministic scenarios, where\nall probabilities are either 0 or 1, and those that correspond to non-deterministic\nscenarios. All no-signaling deterministic correlations are in fact local [Masanes et\nal., 2006], i.e., they can be written in terms of the local correlations defined below\non page 19. But all non-deterministic vertices correspond to non-local scenarios.\nThe complete set of vertices of the no-signaling polytope is in general unknown.\nHowever, in the bi-partite and three-partite case some results have been obtained:\nFor the bi-partite case of two settings and any number of outcomes they are determined by Barrett et al. [2005] and for any number of settings and two possible\noutcomes by Jones and Masanes [2005]. For three parties, two outcomes and two\nsettings the vertices are given in [Barrett et al., 2005].\nThe facets of the no-signaling polytope follow from the defining conditions for\nno-signaling correlations. These are thus the trivial facets that follow from the\npositivity conditions as well as the non-trivial ones that follow from the no-signaling\n6 To see that this is sufficient, let us consider the three-partite case as treated by Barrett et\nal. [2005]. Various types of communication exist that give different forms of signaling. These\nshould all be excluded. Party 1 should not be able to signal to either party 2 or 3 (and cyclic\npermutations). Also if party 2 and 3 are combined to form a composite system then party 1 should\nnot be able to signal to this system. This is expressed by\nX\nX\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) =\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A\u20321 , A2 , A3 ), \u2200a2 , a3 , A1 , A\u20321 , A2 , A3 .\n(2.8)\na1\n\na1\n\nFrom this it also follows that party 1 cannot signal to either party 2 or 3 (this is easily seen by\nsumming over outcomes a2 and a3 respectively). Conversely, if systems 2 and 3 are combined they\nshould not be able to signal to party 1. However this need not be separately specified since it\nalready follows from condition (2.8) and its cyclic permuted versions, as we will now show. From\nthe fact that party 2 cannot signal to the composite system of party 1 and 3, and party 3 cannot\nsignal to the composite system of party 2 and 3 it follows that\nX\nX\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) =\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A\u20322 , A3 ), \u2200a1 , A1 , A2 , A\u20322 , A3\na2 ,a3\n\na2 ,a3\n\n=\n\nX\na2 ,a3\n\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A\u20322 , A\u20323 ), \u2200a1 , A1 , A2 , A\u20322 , A3 , A\u20323 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThis is the condition that the composite system of party 2 and 3 cannot signal to party 1. Hence,\ncondition (2.8) and its cyclic permutations are the only conditions that need to be required to\nensure that no-signaling obtains.\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n19\n\nrequirements (2.7). In section 2.3.1.1 the latter will be explicitly dealt with in\nthe two-partite case. The importance of the non-trivial facets of the no-signaling\npolytope is that if a point, representing some experimental data, lies within the\npolytope, then a model that uses no-signaling correlations exists that reproduces\nthe same data. On the contrary, if the point lies outside the polytope and thus\nviolates some Bell-type inequality describing a facet of the no-signaling polytope,\nthen the data cannot be reproduced by a no-signaling model only, i.e., including\nsome signaling is necessary.\n\n2.2.3\n\nLocal correlations\n\nLocal correlations are those that can be obtained if the parties are non-communicating and share classical information, i.e., they only have local operations and local\nhidden variables (also called shared randomness) as a resource. We take this to\nmean that these correlations can be written as\nZ\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)P (a1 |A1 , \u03bb) . . . P (aN |AN , \u03bb),\n(2.11)\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) =\n\u039b\n\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 \u039b is the value of the shared local hidden variable, \u039b the space of all\nhidden variables and p(\u03bb) is the probability that a particular value of \u03bb occurs7 .\nNote that p(\u03bb) is independent of the outcomes aj and settings Aj . This is a 'freedom'\nassumption, i.e., the settings are assumed to be free variables (we will discuss this\nassumption in the next chapter). Furthermore, P (a1 |A1 , \u03bb) is the probability that\noutcome a1 is obtained by party 1 given that the observable measured was A1 and\nthe shared hidden variable was \u03bb, and similarly for the other terms P (ak |Ak , \u03bb).\nSince these probabilities are conditioned on the hidden variable \u03bb we will call them\nsubsurface probabilities, in contradistinction to the probabilities P (aj |Aj ), etc., that\nonly conditionalize on the settings, which we call surface probabilities8 .\nCondition (2.11) is supposed to capture the idea of locality in a hidden-variable\nframework and it is called Factorisability, and models that give only local correlations are called local hidden-variable (LHV) models. These notions will be further\ndiscussed in the next chapter. Correlations that cannot be written as (2.11) are\ncalled non-local. Local correlations are no-signaling thus the marginal probabilities derived from local correlations are defined in the same way as was done for\nno-signaling correlations, cf. (2.10).\nLet us review what is known about the set of local correlations. First, it\nis also a polytope with vertices (extremal points) corresponding to local deterministic distributions [Werner and Wolf, 2003], i.e., P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) =\n\u03b4a1 ,a1 [A1 ] * * * \u03b4aN ,aN [AN ] where the function a1 [A1 ] gives the deterministic determination of outcome a1 given the setting A1 , etc. Thus for each set of settings\n7 Opinions\n\ndiffer on how to motivate (2.11). In chapter 3 we will come back to this issue.\nThe technical results of this dissertation do not depend on such a motivation and whether it is\nphysically plausible and/or sufficient.\n8 This terminology is partly due to van Fraassen [1985].\n\n\f20\n\nChapter 2\n\n{A1 , . . . , AN } there is a unique set of outcomes {a1 [A1 ], . . . , aN [AN ]} for which\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) = 1. All these vertices are also vertices of the no-signaling\npolytope [Barrett et al., 2005]. The local polytope is known to be constrained by\ntwo kinds of facets [Werner and Wolf, 2003]. The first are trivial facets and derive\nfrom the positivity conditions (2.2). Note that these are also trivial facets of the\nno-signaling polytope. The second kind of facets are non-trivial and can be violated\nby non-local correlations. These are not facets of the no-signaling polytope. All\nfacets are mathematically described by Bell-type inequalities (2.4), that will be further introduced below. Determining whether a point lies within the local polytope,\ni.e., whether it does not violate a local Bell-type inequality, is in general very hard\nas Pitowsky [1989] has shown this to be related to some known hard problems in\ncomputational complexity (i.e., it is an NP-complete problem). Furthermore, determining whether a given inequality is a facet of the local polytope is of similar\ndifficulty (i.e., this problem is co-NP complete [Pitowsky, 1991]).\n\n2.2.4\n\nPartially-local correlations\n\nPartially local correlations are those that can be obtained from an N -partite system\nin which subsets of the N parties form extended systems, whose internal states can\nbe correlated in any way (e.g., signaling), which however behave local with respect\nto each other. Suppose provisionally that parties 1, . . . , k form such a subset and the\nremaining parties k + 1, . . . , N form another subset. The partially-local correlations\ncan then be written as\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) =\n(2.12)\nZ\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)P (a1 , . . . , ak |A1 , . . . , Ak , \u03bb)P (aN \u2212k , . . . , aN |AN \u2212k , . . . , AN , \u03bb),\n\u039b\n\nWe also refer to this condition as partial factorisability9 . The subsurface probabilities on the right hand side need not factorise any further. In case they would all\nfully factorise we retrieve the set of local correlations described above.\nFormulas similar to (2.12) with different partitions of the N -parties into two\nsubsets, i.e., for different choices of the composing parties and different values of k,\ndescribe other possibilities to give partially-local correlations. Convex combinations\nof these possibilities are also admissible. We need not consider decomposition into\nmore than two subsystems since any two subsystems in such a decomposition can\nbe considered jointly as parts of one subsystem still uncorrelated with respect to\nthe others.\n9 Partial factorisability is sometimes also called partial separability. Indeed, in the few papers\nthat have appeared on this subject [Svetlichny, 1987; Seevinck and Svetlichny, 2002; Collins et\nal., 2002; Uffink, 2002] this is the case. However, for consistency in the terminology we prefer the\nterm partial factorisability. In this dissertation separability is a concept defined only in terms of\nthe structure of quantum states on a Hilbert space and not in terms of the structure of classical\nprobability distributions.\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n21\n\nWe define a model to have partially-local correlations when the correlations are\nof the form (2.12) or when they can be written as convex combinations of similar\nexpressions on the right hand side of (2.12) for the different possible partitions of the\nN parties into two subsets. Such a model is called a partially-local hidden-variable\n(PHLV) model10 . Models whose correlations cannot be written in this partiallylocal form are fully non-local, i.e., they are said to contain full non-locality.\nThe set of partially-local correlations has a finite number of extreme points and\nis thus also a polytope [Jones et al., 2005], called the partially-local polytope. It is\nalso convex since it can be easily seen that if two distributions satisfy (2.12) then\ntheir convex mixture will too. For each extreme point of this convex polytope there\nis a partition into two subsets, say {1, . . . , k} and {k + 1, . . . , N }, such that for each\nset of settings {A1 , . . . , AN } there is a unique set of outcomes {a1 . . . , aN } for which\nP (a1 , . . . , ak |A1 , . . . , Ak , \u03bb) = 1 and P (aN \u2212k , . . . , aN |AN \u2212k , . . . , AN , \u03bb) = 1. There\nis thus a one-to-one correspondence between the extreme points corresponding to\na partition of the parties into two subsets and the set of functions from the two\ncorresponding subsets of settings to the two corresponding subsets of outcomes.\nJust as was the case for general and local correlations, we again see the deterministic\nscenario arising for the extreme points.\nLet us consider this in more detail and take the example where N = 3, first\nstudied by Svetlichny [1987]. Only three different partitions into two subsets are\npossible. The three-partite partially-local correlations are thus of the form\nZ\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) =\nd\u03bb[p1 \u03c11 (\u03bb)P1 (a1 |A1 , \u03bb)P1 (a2 , a3 |A2 , A3 , \u03bb)\n\u039b\n\n+ p2 \u03c12 (\u03bb)P2 (a2 |A2 , \u03bb)P2 (a1 , a3 |A1 , A3 , \u03bb)\n\n+ p3 \u03c13 (\u03bb)P3 (a3 |A3 , \u03bb)P3 (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 , \u03bb)].\n(2.13)\n\nwhere P1 (a2 , a3 |A2 , A3 , \u03bb) can be any probability distribution; it need not factorise\ninto P1 (a2 |A2 , \u03bb)P1 (a3 |A3 , \u03bb). Analogously for the other two joint probability terms.\nThe \u03c1i (\u03bb) are the hidden-variable distributions. Models whose correlations cannot\nbe written in this form are fully non-local, i.e., they are said to contain full threepartite non-locality.\nBecause the correlations between subsets of particles are allowed to be signaling, the marginal probabilities may depend on the settings corresponding to the\noutcomes that are no longer considered. This must be explicitly accounted for. For\nexample, the marginal P (a1 , a2 , |A1 , A2 )A3 derived from (2.13) may depend on the\nsetting chosen by party 3, and the marginal P (a1 |A1 )A2 ,A3 for party 1 may depend\non the setting chosen by both party 2 and 3, etc. Because we must allow for convex\ncombinations of different partially-local configurations, as in (2.13), the marginals\ncan depend on the settings chosen by all other parties, despite the fact that at the\nhidden variable level there can not be signaling between all three parties.\n10 Collins\n\net al. [2002] have called this a 'local-nonlocal model'.\n\n\f22\n\n2.2.5\n\nChapter 2\n\nQuantum correlations\n\nLastly, we consider another class of correlations: those that are obtained by general\nmeasurements on quantum states (i.e., those that can be generated if the parties\nshare quantum states). These can be written as\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) = Tr[MaA11 \u2297 * * * \u2297 MaANN \u03c1].\n\n(2.14)\n\nHere \u03c1 is a quantum state (i.e., a unit trace semi-definite positive operator) on\na Hilbert space H = H1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 HN , where Hj is the quantum state space of\nthe system held by party j. The sets {MaA11 , . . . , MaANN } define what is called a\nA\npositive operator valued measure11 (POVM), i.e., a set of positive operators {Majj }\nP\nAj\nAj\nsatisfying aj Maj = 1, \u2200Aj . Of course, all operators Maj must commute for\ndifferent j in order for the joint probability distribution to be well defined, but this\nis ensured since for different j the operators are defined for different subsystems\n(with each their own Hilbert space) and are therefore commuting. Note that (2.14)\nA\nis linear in both Majj and \u03c1, which is a crucial feature of quantum mechanics.\nQuantum correlations are no-signaling and therefore the marginal probabilities\nderived from such correlations are defined in the same way as was done for nosignaling correlations (cf. (2.10)). For example, the marginal probability for party\n1 is given by P (a1 |A1 ) = Tr[MaA11 \u03c11 ], where \u03c11 is the reduced state for party 1.\nThe set of quantum correlations has been investigated by, e.g., Pitowsky [1989],\nTsirelson [1993], and Werner and Wolf [2001] and is shown to be convex. It is not\na polytope because the number of extremal points is not finite and consequently it\nhas an infinite number of bounding halfplanes. Therefore we will refer to this set as\nthe quantum body, in contradistinction to the sets of the other types of correlations\nwhich are referred to as polytopes.\nWe note that in order to describe the full measurement process it is necessary to\nspecify the set of so-called Kraus operators {KaAii } that correspond to the POVM\nelements {MaAii }, where MaAii = KaAii (KaAii )\u2020 . In general many different sets of Kraus\noperators correspond to the same POVM element. The reason for including the\nKraus operators is that the description of a POVM as a set of positive operators\n{MaAii } is incomplete because it does not specify uniquely what the state of the\nsystem is after the measurement. By including the Kraus operators one is able\nto retrieve the Projection Postulate: if a POVM measurement is performed on\nsystem i then the state \u03c1i directly after the measurement will be given by \u03c1\u0303i =\nKaAii \u03c1i (KaAii )\u2020 / Tr[KaAii \u03c1i (KaAii )\u2020 ].\n11 Note that POVM measurements include as a special case the ordinary von Neumann measurements that use so called projection valued measures (PVM) where all positive operators are\northogonal projection operators.\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n2.3\n\n23\n\nOn comparing and discriminating the different\nkinds of correlations\n\nLet us present the relationships between the correlations of the previous section,\nsome of which are already known, some of which are proven in this dissertation.\nThe polytope of general correlations strictly contains the no-signaling polytope,\nwhich in turn contains the quantum body, which in turn contains the partiallylocal polytope, which in turn contains the local polytope. See Figure 2.1. These\nresults are obtained by comparing the facets of the relevant polytopes and halfplanes\nthat bound the quantum bodies. These facets (i.e., bounding hyperplanes in the\ncase of quantum correlations) are of course implicitly determined by the defining\nrestrictions on the different types of correlations, but to find explicit experimentally\naccessible expressions for them is a hard job. A fruitful way of doing so is using\nso-called Bell-type inequalities. This will be discussed next.\n\nNS\nN\nNS\nQ\nPL\nP\nL\n\nL\n\nL\n\nL\nQ\nPL\nNS\n\nN\n\nP\nPL\nP\nQ\nPL\n\nN\nNS\n\nL\nL\n\nFigure 2.1: Schematic representation of the space of correlations, after Barrett et al.\n[2005]. The vertices are labeled L, PL and NL for the local, partially-local and no-signaling\npolytope. The region inside each of these polytopes is denoted by L, P, and N respectively.\nThe accessible quantum region is denoted by Q.\n\n\f24\n\nChapter 2\n\n2.3.1\n\nBell-type inequalities: finding experimentally\naccessible bounds that discriminate between\ndifferent types of correlations\n\nIn this dissertation we will investigate all of the above types of correlations by deriving experimentally accessible conditions that distinguish them from one another. In\nparticular we will study Bell-type inequalities for the case where each party chooses\nbetween two alternative observables and where each observable is dichotomic, i.e.,\nthe observable has two possible outcomes which we denote by \u00b11.\nBell-type inequalities denote a specific bound on a linear sum of joint probabilities as in (2.4). The bound is characteristic of the type of correlation under study.\nHowever, frequently they are formulated not in terms of probabilities but in terms\nof product expectation values12 , i.e., expectation values of products of observables,\nwhich we will denote by hA1 A2 * * * AN i. These are defined in the usual way as the\nweighted sum of the products of the outcomes:\nX\na1 a2 * * * aN P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ).\n(2.15)\nhA1 A2 * * * AN i :=\na1 ,...,aN\n\nSince we are restricting ourselves to dichotomic observables with outcomes \u00b11 all\nexpectation values are bounded by: \u22121 \u2264 hA1 A2 * * * AN i \u2264 1, for all A1 , A2 , . . . , AN .\nThe probabilities P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) in (2.15) are determined using the\ndifferent kinds of correlations we have previously defined. If they are of the local form (2.11) we denote the product expectation values they give rise to by\nhA1 A2 * * * AN ilhv , and analogously for other types of correlation. This is captured\nin table 2.1.\ntype\nno-signaling\nlocal\npartially-local\nquantum\n\nnotation\nhA1 A2 * * * AN ins\n\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ) in (2.15) given by\n(2.7)\n\nhA1 A2 * * * AN ilhv\n\n(2.11)\n\nhA1 A2 * * * AN iqm\n\n(2.14)\n\nhA1 A2 * * * AN iplhv\n\n(2.12)\n\nTable 2.1: The different kinds of product expectation values that arise from the different\nkinds of correlations.\n\nWe will investigate the different possible correlations using Bell-type inequalities in terms of product expectation values as given in table 2.1. We will not\ninvestigate them directly in terms of the joint probabilities. The main reason for\nthis is that using the product expectation values simplifies the investigation considerably. For example, consider the case of two parties that each measure two\n12 These\n\nare also known as 'joint expectation values' or 'correlation functions', see e.g., \u017bukowski\net al. [2002], but we will not use this terminology.\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n25\n\ndichotomous observables each. We denoted them as A1 , A\u20321 and A2 , A\u20322 respectively,\nwith outcomes a1 , a\u20321 and a2 , a\u20322 . Instead of dealing with the 16-dimensional space\nof vectors with components P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ), P (a\u20321 , a2 |A1 , A2 ), . . . , P (a\u20321 , a\u20322 |A\u20321 , A\u20322 )\nwe only have to deal with the 4-dimensional vectors that have as components the\nquantities hA1 , A2 i,hA1 , A\u20322 i,hA\u20321 , A2 i,hA\u20321 , A\u20322 i. To transform a vector from the 16dimensional space to its corresponding 4-dimensional space, one needs to perform a\nprojection as given in (2.15). It is known that the projection of a convex polytope is\nalways a convex polytope [Masanes, 2002]. Therefore, the convex polytopes we have\nconsidered previously for general, no-signaling, partially-local and local correlations\nin the higher dimensional joint probability space correspond to convex polytopes\nin the lower dimensional space of product expectation values. The set of vectors\nwith components hA1 , A2 i, hA1 , A\u20322 i, hA\u20321 , A2 i, hA\u20321 , A\u20322 i that are attainable by general, no-signaling, partially-local and local correlations are thus also characterized\nby a finite set of extreme points and corresponding facets.\nDealing with the expectation values hA1 A2 * * * AN i is much simpler than dealing with the joint probabilities P (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ), although in general, the\nprojection (2.15) is not structure preserving. For example some non-local correlations could be projected into locally achievable expectation values of products of\nobservables. But for the case of two parties that each choose two dichotomous observables, as in the set-up of the CHSH inequality, this does not happen. Indeed,\nin the next subsection we will see that the CHSH inequalities describe all nontrivial facets of the local polytope. The 4-dimensional vectors with components\nhA1 , A2 i, hA1 , A\u20322 i, hA\u20321 , A2 i, hA\u20321 , A\u20322 i and the 16-dimensional vectors with components P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ), P (a\u20321 , a2 |A1 , A2 ), . . . , P (a\u20321 , a\u20322 |A\u20321 , A\u20322 ) thus contain the same\ninformation concerning the existence of a LHV model accounting for them.\nFor simplicity, in this dissertation we study the correlations in the lower dimensional space of product expectation values, despite the fact that some information\nabout the correlations might be lost13 . We thus consider Bell-type inequalities that\ndenote halfplanes in this space. For this purpose it is useful to define the so-called\nBell polynomials. These are linear combinations of products of N observables, one\nfor each party, and have the generic form\nX\nc(j1 , . . . , jN )Aj11 * * * AjNN ,\n(2.16)\nBN (c) =\nj1 ,...,jN\n\nwhere the coefficients14 c(j1 , . . . , jN ) are taken to be real numbers and together\nQ\nmake up a vector c in a real dimensional space of dimension i mAi . For example,\n\n13 There is a sole exception, however. For the case of two parties that each choose two dichotomous observables the no-signaling polytope in the four-dimensional space of product expectation\nvalues has only trivial facets. We will we therefore consider a larger dimensional space in order to obtain Bell-type inequalities that are non-trivial for the no-signaling correlations. We will\ncomment further on this in section 2.3.1.1.\n14 To avoid confusion we note that j ,j , etc., are not some numbers that indicate an exponent\n1 2\nbut labels that distinguish various measurement settings for parties 1,2, etc. (i.e., the observables\nAji i for party i are different for each ji ).\n\n\f26\n\nChapter 2\n\nfor the case of two parties and two observables per party (i.e., j1 , j2 \u2208 {1, 2} one\nobtains the polynomial c(1, 1)A11 A12 +c(1, 2)A11 A22 +c(2, 1)A21 A12 +c(2, 2)A21 A22 , where\nthe coefficients c(1, 1), . . . , c(2, 2) are still to be specified. The quantum counterpart\nof the Bell polynomials, where the observables are POVM operators, will be called\nBell operators.\nBell-type inequalities are now obtained by finding non-trivial numerical bounds\nI N,c > 0 on the expectation value of BN (c), denoted as hBN (c)i, for each of the different types of correlations defined above. Because of linearity of the mean hBN (c)i\ncan be expressed in terms of the different expectation values hA1 A2 * * * AN i of table\n2.1 for the different types of correlation. For example, a Bell-type inequality for\nlocal correlations reads\nX\nN,c\nc(j1 , . . . , cN )hAj11 * * * AjNN ilhv | \u2264 Ilhv\n, \u2200 Aj11 , . . . , AjNN ,\n|hBN (c)ilhv | = |\nj1 ,...,cN\n\n(2.17)\n\nand analogous for the other types of correlations so as to give table 2.2. These\nBell-type inequalities will be called no-signaling, partially-local, local, and quantum\nBell-type inequalities.\ntype of correlation\n\nnotation of Bell-type inequality\n\nno-signaling\n\nN,c\n|hBN (c)ins | \u2264 Ins\n\nlocal\npartially-local\nquantum\n\nN,c\n|hBN (c)ilhv | \u2264 Ilhv\n\nN,c\n|hBN (c)iplhv | \u2264 Iplhv\nN,c\n|hBN (c)iqm | \u2264 Iqm\n\nTable 2.2: The notation of Bell-type inequalities for the different kinds of correlations.\n\nIn order to obtain Bell-type inequalities one thus has to specify the vector c\nN,c\nN,c\nN,c\nof coefficients c(j1 , . . . , cN ) as well as one or more of the bounds Ins\n, Ilhv\n, Iplhv\n,\nN,c\nIqm\n.

General unrestricted correlations always exist that\nattain this absolute maximum since one can always choose each hAj11 * * * AjNN i to\nbe either +1 or \u22121, depending of the sign of the coefficient c(j1 , . . . , cN ) so that it\ncontributes positively to hBN (c)i so that hBN (c)i = |BN (c)|max .\nIt remains to indicate what is meant by a non-trivial bound.

A bound is called a tight bound when it can be reached\nby the correlations under study. Even more desirable would be obtaining a socalled tight Bell-type inequality. The tight inequalities correspond to facets (2.4)\nof the relevant correlation polytopes in the larger joint probability space when\nthe expectation values in the Bell inequality are expressed in terms of the joint\nprobability distributions via the inverse of the projections (2.15). Violating a tight\nBell-type inequality means precisely that the point lies above the facet, i.e., outside\nof the polytope15 . A complete set of tight Bell-type inequalities for a specific type of\ncorrelation thus gives precisely all facets of the corresponding correlation polytope.\nThis of course does not hold for the quantum case whose set of correlations (i.e.,\nthe quantum body) is not a polytope. However since this set is still convex it can\nbe described by an infinite set of bounding hyperplanes, each of which is described\nby a corresponding Bell-type inequality that has a tight bound.\nIn this dissertation many new non-trivial bounds are obtained for novel Bell-type\ninequalities (of which some are tight) for different types of correlations.\n2.3.1.1\n\nBi-partite example: the CHSH inequality\n\nThe best-known Bell-type inequality is the CHSH inequality for local correlations\n[Clauser et al., 1969] that assumes a situation of two parties and two dichotomous\nobservables per party (with possible outcomes \u00b11). We will first review this wellknown result after which we consider this inequality when evaluated using quantum\nand no-signaling correlations.\nConsider the CHSH polynomial where c(1, 1) = c(1, 2) = c(2, 1) = \u2212c(2, 2) = 1\nin (2.16):\nBchsh = A1 A2 + A1 A\u20322 + A\u20321 A2 \u2212 A\u20321 A\u20322 ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere A1 , A\u20321 denote the two different observables for party 1, and A2 , A\u20322 those\nfor party 2. The product expectation values are easily obtained, e.g., hA1 A2 i =\nP (+1, +1|A1 , A2 ) + P (\u22121, \u22121|A1, A2 ) \u2212 P (+1, \u22121|A1 , A2 ) \u2212 P (\u22121, +1|A1 , A2 ), etc.\nLocal correlations\nClauser et al. [1969] showed that all local correlations obey the tight bound\n|hBchsh ilhv | = |hA1 A2 + A1 A\u20322 + A\u20321 A2 \u2212 A\u20321 A\u20322 ilhv |\n\n= |hA1 A2 ilhv + hA1 A\u20322 ilhv + hA\u20321 A2 ilhv \u2212 hA\u20321 A\u20322 ilhv | \u2264 2.\n\n(2.19)\n\n15 A possible confusion may arise here. Non-trivial Bell-type inequalities are possible that can be\nsaturated by some extremal correlations (of the type under study), but which are nevertheless not\nindicating facets of the relevant correlation polytope. The possible confusion arises because these\ninequalities can be said to be 'tight' in the sense of not having a tighter upper bound. However, we\nwill in general not call such inequalities tight Bell-type inequalities because they do not indicate\na facet. For a facet it is necessary that at least d affinely independent extreme points lie on the\nfacet, and not less (cf. footnote 4).\n\n\f28\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe local polytope is the subset in the four dimensional real space R4 of all vectors\n(hA1 A2 i,\nhA1 A\u20322 i, hA\u20321 A2 i, hA\u20321 A\u20322 i) that can be attained by local correlations. It is the convex\nhull in R4 of the 8 extreme points (vertices) that are of the form\n(1, 1, 1, 1), (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121), (1, 1, \u22121, \u22121), (\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1),\n\n(1, \u22121, 1, \u22121), (\u22121, 1, \u22121, 1), (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1), (\u22121, 1, 1, \u22121).\n\n(2.20)\n\nThis polytope is the four-dimensional octahedron and has 8 trivial facets as well as\n8 non-trivial ones. The trivial ones are the inequalities of the form\n\u22121 \u2264 hA1 A2 ilhv \u2264 1,\n\n\u22121 \u2264 hA\u20321 A2 ilhv \u2264 1,\n\n\u22121 \u2264 hA1 A\u20322 ilhv \u2264 1,\n\n\u22121 \u2264 hA\u20321 A\u20322 ilhv \u2264 1.\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe non-trivial facets are all equivalent to the CHSH inequality (2.19), up to trivial\nsymmetries, giving a total of 8 equivalent inequalities, as first proven by Fine [1982],\ncf. Collins and Gisin [2004]. These eight are [Barrett et al., 2005]:\n(\u22121)\u03b3 hA1 A2 ilhv +(\u22121)\u03b2+\u03b3 hA1 A\u20322 ilhv +\n\n(\u22121)\u03b1+\u03b3 hA\u20321 A2 ilhv + (\u22121)\u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3+1 hA\u20321 A\u20322 ilhv \u2264 2,\n\n(2.22)\n\nwith \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 {0, 1}. These are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a LHV\nmodel to exist. Note that for the bi-partite case there is no distinction between\npartially-local and local correlations, and hence the partially-local polytope and\nthe local polytope coincide.\nQuantum correlations\nIn terms of the CHSH polynomial a non-trivial tight quantum bound is given by\nthe Tsirelson inequality [Tsirelson, 1980]\n\u221a\n(2.23)\n|hBchsh iqm | \u2264 2 2,\nwhich can be reached by entangled states. This shows that the local polytope is\nstrictly contained in the quantum body, which can be regarded a concise statement of Bell's theorem [Bell, 1964]. In Part II we will further investigate quantum\ncorrelations using the CHSH polynomial and obtain some interesting new results.\nNo-signaling correlations\nNo-signaling correlations are able to violate the Tsirelson inequality (2.23). A well\nknown example of this is the joint distribution known as the Popescu-Rohrlich\ndistribution [Popescu and Rohrlich, 1994], also known as the PR box, defined by:\n1\n\u03b4a ,a ,\n2 1 2\n1\nP (a\u20321 , a2 |A\u20321 , A2 ) = \u03b4a\u20321 ,a2 ,\n2\n\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) =\n\n1\n\u03b4a ,a\u2032 ,\n2 1 2\n1 1\nP (a\u20321 , a\u20322 |A\u20321 , A\u20322 ) = \u2212 \u03b4a\u20321 ,a\u20322 ,\n2 2\nP (a1 , a\u20322 |A1 , A\u20322 ) =\n\n(2.24)\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n29\n\nThis correlation gives hBchsh ins = 4, which is the absolute maximum |Bchsh |max .\nIn fact, it is an extreme point of the no-signaling polytope for the case of two\ndichotomous observables per party. Furthermore, all the no-signaling extreme points\nof this polytope have a such a form. They can all be written as [Barrett et al., 2005]\n\u001a\n1/2, if a1 \u2295 a2 = A1 A2 ,\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) =\n(2.25)\n0, otherwise,\nwhere \u2295 denotes addition modulo 2. Here the outcomes a1 , a2 and the settings\nA1 , A2 are labeled by 0 and 1 respectively, where 0 corresponds to outcome +1 and\nthe unprimed observable respectively; and 1 corresponds to outcome \u22121 and the\nprimed observable respectively. It is not hard to see that (2.24) is indeed a member\nof the class (2.25).\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-local extreme points and\nthe facets of the local polytope that are given by the CHSH inequalities (2.22). To\nshow this we note that the CHSH inequalities in the larger 16-dimensional space of\ncorrelations are equal to:\n1 \u2264 P (a1 = a2 ) + P (a1 = a\u20322 ) + P (a\u20321 = a2 ) + P (a\u20321 6= a\u20322 ) \u2264 3\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhere P (a1 = a2 ) := P (+1, +1|A1 , A2 )+P (\u22121, \u22121|A, B), P (a\u20321 6= a\u20322 ) := P (+1, \u22121|A\u20321, A\u20322 )+\nP (\u22121, +1|A\u20321 , A\u20322 ), etc. This gives two inequalities and the other 6 are obtained by\npermuting the primed and unprimed quantities for system 1 and 2 respectively. A\ntotal of 8 local extreme points saturate each of these inequalities. They are deterministic, i.e., P (+1, +1|A1 , A2 ) = P (+1|A1 )P (+1|A2 ), etc., where P (+1|A1 ) and\nP (+1|A2 ) are either 0 or 1. Because these 8 extreme points are also linearly independent the inequalities (2.26) (and the equivalent ones) give the facets of the\n8-dimensional local polytope in the larger space of correlations.\nThe 8 local extreme points that lie on each of the local facets are also extreme\npoints of the no-signaling polytope. Only one extreme no-signaling correlation\n(2.25) is on top of each local facet, and it violates the CHSH inequality associated to this local facet maximally [Barrett et al., 2005]. This is the one-to-one\ncorrespondence referred to above. This is depicted in Figure 2.2.\nThe non-trivial facets of the no-signaling polytope are given by the defining\nequalities on the left hand side of (2.6) and read in the dichotomic case\nX\nX\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) =\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A\u20322 ),\n(2.27)\na2 =+1,\u22121\n\na2 =+1,\u22121\n\nfor a1 = +1, \u22121, and analogous equalities are obtained by permutations of settings\nand outcomes so as to give a total of eight equalities. The tight Bell-type inequalities\ncorresponding to (2.27) are easily obtained:\nX\nX\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) \u2264\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A\u20322 ),\n(2.28a)\na2 =+1,\u22121\n\nX\n\na2 =+1,\u22121\n\na2 =+1,\u22121\n\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) \u2265\n\nX\n\na2 =+1,\u22121\n\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A\u20322 ).\n\n(2.28b)\n\n\f30\n\nChapter 2\n\nNL\n\nFigure 2.2: The local facet is the hyperplane through the closed line connecting the 8 local\nextreme points. Above this facet exactly one no-signaling extreme point is situated (after\nAc\u0131\u0301n et al. [2006b]).\n\nIn terms of expectation values we obtain non-trivial inequalities for the marginals16:\nA\u2032\n\nA\u2032\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(2.29)\nand hA1 iA\nhA1 iA\nns \u2265 hA1 ins ,\nns \u2264 hA1 ins ,\nP\nA2\n2\nand P (a1 |A1 )A2 as defined in\nwhere we have used hA1 iA\nns :=\na1 a1 P (a1 |A1 )\n(2.5) and obeying the no-signaling constraint (2.6).\nIf we consider product expectation values instead of the marginal ones we only\nobtain trivial inequalities. In the space R4 of vectors with components (hA1 A2 i,\nhA1 A\u20322 i, hA\u20321 A2 i, hA\u20321 A\u20322 i) the 8 no-signaling extreme points (2.25) give the following\nvertices\n\n(\u22121, 1, 1, 1), (1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121), (1, \u22121, 1, 1), (\u22121, 1, \u22121, \u22121),\n\n(1, 1, \u22121, 1), (\u22121, \u22121, 1, \u22121), (1, 1, 1, \u22121), (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 1).\n\n(2.30)\n\nIn this space the no-signaling polytope is the convex hull of the 16 local extreme\npoints (2.20) and of those given by (2.30). Its facet inequalities are just the 8 trivial\ninequalities in (2.21) and therefore it is in fact just the four-dimensional unit cube\n[Pitowsky, 2008]. We thus obtain only trivial facet inequalities.\nIn the next chapter, section 3.5, we derive non-trivial no-signaling inequalities\nin terms of the product and marginal expectation values. Although these cannot be\ntight inequalities, i.e., they cannot be facets of the no-signaling polytope, we show\nthem to do useful work nevertheless. In order to obtain these inequalities we will\nhave to consider a larger dimensional space than the four-dimensional of vectors\n16 In\n\n\u2032\n\nB\ncase no-signaling obtains we can define hAins := hAiB\nns = hAins because the marginal for\nparty 1 does not depent on the setting chosen by party 2 (cf. (2.6)). Inserting this in (2.28) gives\nthe trivial inequalities hAins \u2264 hAins and hAins \u2265 hAins . However, this misses the point. Because\nthe non-trivial tight no-signaling Bell-type inequalities are supposed to discern the no-signaling\ncorrelations from more general correlations one must allow for the most general framework in which\nsignaling is in principle possible., i.e, where the marginals can depend on the settings corresponding\nto the outcomes that are no longer considered. This cannot be excluded from the start.\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n31\n\n(hA1 A2 i, hA1 A\u20322 i,\nhA\u20321 A2 i, hA\u20321 A\u20322 i). This is the only instance in this dissertation where we will have\nto go outside the smaller space of product expectation values.\nComparing the different correlations\nThe no-signaling correlation (2.24) was discovered already in 1985 independently\nby Khalfin and Tsirelson [1985] and Rastall [1985] who also showed it to give the\nalgebraic maximum for the CHSH expression. However, Popescu and Rohrlich\n[1994] presented this correlation in order to ask an interesting question, not asked\npreviously: Why do quantum correlations not violate the CHSH expression by a\nlarger amount? Such a larger violation would be compatible with no-signaling,\nso why is quantum mechanics not more non-local? This paper by Popescu and\nRohrlich marked the start of a new research area, that of investigating no-signaling\ndistributions and their relationship to quantum mechanics.\nFor the bi-partite case and two dichotomous observables per party the above\nresults show how the different sets of correlations are related: Since some quantum\ncorrelations turn out to be non-local in the sense of not being of the local form (2.11),\nthe set of quantum correlations is a proper superset of the set of local correlations.\nBut it is a proper subset of the set of no-signaling correlations which are able\nto violate the Tsirelson inequality up to the absolute maximum. In summary, the\nCHSH polynomial gives inequalities that give a non-trivial tight bound for local and\nquantum correlations but not so for no-signaling correlations. Indeed, the latter can\nreach the absolute maximum |Bchsh |max .\nA useful way of visualizing the bounds on the CHSH inequality for the different\ntypes of correlations -one that we will frequently use in this dissertation- is\n\u2032\nthe following. Consider another Bell-type polynomial Bchsh\nthat is obtained from\n\u2032\nBchsh by permuting the primed and unprimed observables so as to give Bchsh\n=\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nA1 A2 + A1 A2 + A1 A2 \u2212 A1 A2 . For this Bell-type polynomial the same bounds on\nthe Bell-type inequalities for the different types of correlations are obtained. We can\n\u2032\nnow depict the accessible regions for the correlations in the (hBchsh i, hBchsh\ni)-plane,\nas in 2.3. This figure shows the inclusion relations mentioned above. We will use\nmany similar figures later on. They provide a useful tool to compare the different\ncorrelations via the bounds on Bell-type inequalities they admit.\n2.3.1.2\n\nMultipartite Bell-type inequalities\n\nWe briefly review some known multi-partite Bell-type inequalities relevant for this\ndissertation for the four types of correlations we have distinguished. This gives\nan opportunity to further introduce some of the results that are obtained in this\ndissertation.\n(1) Local correlations: For two dichotomic observables per party the full set\nof necessary and sufficient Bell-type inequalities for local correlations is known.\nThese are the Werner-Wolf-\u017bukowski-Brukner(WWZB) inequalities [Werner and\n\n\f32\n\nChapter 2\n\n\u2032\nhBchsh\ni\n\n4\n\u221a\n2 2\n2\n\nhBchsh i\n\n\u2032\nFigure 2.3: Comparing the regions in the (hBchsh i, hBchsh\ni)-plane. General unrestricted\nand no-signaling correlations are confined to the largest square, quantum correlations to\nthe middle square, and local correlations to the smallest square.\n\nWolf, 2001; \u017bukowski and Brukner, 2002]. They give all facets of the local polytope.\nA special form of the WWZB inequalities are the so called Mermin-type inequalities\n[Mermin, 1990; Roy and Singh, 1991; Ardehali, 1992; Belinskii and Klyshko, 1993]\nwhich were the first multi-partite Bell-type inequalities for all N that gave bounds\non local correlations and which were shown to be exponentially violated by quantum\ncorrelations. For more than two outcomes and settings, many partial results exist,\nbut no full set of local inequalities is found. For a recent overview, see Gisin [2007].\n(2) Partially-local correlations: For N =3 Svetlichny [1987] obtained partiallylocal inequalities for two dichotomous observables per party. In this dissertation we\ngive the generalization of this result to N -parties, thereby obtaining the so-called\nSvetlichny inequalities for all N .\n(3) Quantum correlations: The quantum body in the space of multi-partite correlations is not well investigated. For the two-qubit case some results have been obtained for two dichotomous observables and two parties: the well-known Tsirelson\ninequality and some non-linear inequalities [Navascu\u00e9s et al., 2007; Uffink, 2002;\nPitowsky, 2008] that strengthen this inequality. For more observables with a finite\nnumber of outcomes for the case of two parties Navascu\u00e9s et al. [2007] gave a hierarchy of conditions where each condition is formulated as a semi-definite program.\nFor more parties but two dichotomous observables per party one can often use\nthe Bell-polynomials that feature in Bell-type inequalities for local correlations to\nobtain non-trivial inequalities for the set of quantum correlations as well. If the\nquantum bound on the expectation value of the Bell-polynomial is less than the\nabsolute maximum of polynomial, one has a non-trivial inequality for bounding\nthe quantum correlations. Only a subset of the Bell-polynomials used to obtain\nthe WWZB inequalities give such inequalities, but not all of them. We will show\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n33\n\nthat the Bell-polynomials of the generalized Svetlichny inequalities for partial locality also give non-trivial quantum bounds. Some non-linear strengthening of these\nquantum bounds are known [Uffink, 2002; Roy, 2005; Nagata et al., 2002b]. In\nthis dissertation this will be strengthened even further using state-dependent upper\nbounds.\nApart from using linear or non-linear Bell-type inequalities in terms of Bellpolynomials where all parties are involved, we will also investigate another fruitful\nway of studying the different kinds of correlations via the question whether the correlations can be shared. Here one focuses on subsets of the particles and asks whether\ntheir correlations can be extended to parties not in the original subsets. This can\nbe done either directly in terms of joint probability distributions or in terms of relations between Bell-type inequalities that hold for different, but overlapping subsets\nof the parties involved. When a correlation cannot be shared it is said to have\nmonogamy constraints. For three-partite quantum and no-signaling correlations\nsuch monogamy is shown to exist using a Bell-type inequality. These monogamy results give non-trivial bounds on multi-partite quantum and no-signaling correlations\nthereby discriminating them from each other and from more general correlations.\nBecause we will use this technique only in a single chapter, chapter 7, we will not\nintroduce the technical details of this issue here, but will do so in the introduction\nto that chapter.\n(4) No-signaling correlations: The facets of the convex no-signaling polytope\nfollow from the defining conditions (2.7) on the space of correlations\nP (a1 , . . . , aN |A1 , . . . , AN ). In terms of marginal expectation values they are of the\nform: for each k \u2208 {1, . . . , N }\n\u2032\n\nhA1 , . . . , Ak\u22121 , Ak+1 , . . . , AN iAk = hA1 , . . . , Ak\u22121 , Ak+1 , . . . , AN iAk ,\n\n(2.31)\n\nfor all settings A1 , . . . , Ak\u22121 , Ak , A\u2032k , Ak+1 , . . . , AN . This ensures that all marginal\nexpectation values are independent of the settings that are no longer considered.\nThe tight Bell-type inequalities corresponding to this equality are easily obtained:\nreplace all occurrences of = by \u2264 and \u2265.\nThis procedure gives only restrictions on the marginal expectation values. However, it is sometimes useful to have non-trivial no-signaling Bell-type inequalities\nin terms of the product expectation values hA1 * * * AN i, despite the fact that they\ncannot be tight inequalities, i.e., they cannot be facets of the no-signaling polytope. For N = 2 and two dichotomous observables per party we will present such\nnon-trivial Bell-type inequalities in the next chapter, section 3.5. Unfortunately,\nfor N > 2 both the WWZB and the generalized Svetlichny inequalities (which give\nnon-trivial bounds on the local and quantum correlations in terms of product expectation values) do not give non-trivial bounds for no-signaling correlations, since\nthese correlations can attain the absolute maximum of the corresponding Bell-type\npolynomials. However, for N = 3 we will argue in chapter 7 that an already existing\nmonogamy constraint gives a non-trivial bound for the no-signaling correlations in\nterms of product expectation values only.\n\n\f34\n\nChapter 2\n\nFor completeness we note that non-trivial Bell-type inequalities exist (i) for\nspecific forms of non-local no-signaling resources [Brunner et al., 2006], but these\ndo not hold for general no-signaling correlations, and (ii) for some specific forms of\nsignaling resources that employ a finite amount of auxiliary communication [Toner\nand Bacon, 2003]. In this dissertation we will strive to be as general as possible and\ntherefore do not study such specific no-signaling or signaling resources.\n\n2.3.2\n\nFurther aspects of quantum correlations\n\nThe structure of the set of correlations in a general quantum system can be studied\nin at least two different ways. The first way looks at the state space of quantum\nmechanics and investigates bounds on the accessible quantum body in the space of\nquantum correlations (e.g., quantum Bell-type inequalities) as well as the separability and entanglement properties of the states that live in this space. The second\nway investigates the non-locality and no-signaling characteristics of the quantum\nstates. In this case one investigates if the quantum mechanical correlations these\nstates give rise to can be described by local, partially-local or no-signaling models.\nBell-type inequalities are the main tool here. In this thesis we will use both methods\nto investigate N -partite quantum correlations.\nThese two investigations are not independent, as the following example shows.\nConsider the CHSH polynomial Bchsh and the corresponding\n\u221a local, quantum and\nno-signaling inequalities |hBchsh ilhv | \u2264 2, |hBchsh iqm | \u2264 2 2 and |hBchsh ins | \u2264 4\nrespectively, whose bounds are all tight. Since the quantum bound is strictly greater\nthan the local bound but strictly smaller than the no-signaling bound one concludes\nthat states that reach the quantum bound are both no-signaling and non-local.\nFurthermore, it is well known that two types of quantum states exist: entangled\nstates and non-entangled states, i.e., separable states (see the next subsection 2.3.2.1\nfor a formal definition). The correlations these two types of states give rise to also\nhave different characteristics. For example, entangled states can give rise to nonlocal correlations\nin the sense that they violate |hBchsh iqm | \u2264 2 up to the Tsirelson\n\u221a\nbound 2 2 (cf. (2.23)). But this is never the case for separable states. Indeed,\nthe correlations that separable states give rise to always allow for a LHV model.\nViolation of the quantum CHSH inequality |hBchsh iqm | \u2264 2 is thus sufficient for\nentanglement detection: it allows for experimentally distinguishing separable from\nentangled quantum states. This entanglement detection capability shows another\ninteresting feature of Bell-type inequalities.\nIn the multi-partite case many more different types of quantum states exist than\njust separable and entangled states, such as partially separable states and different\nkinds of entangled states. The structure of these different kinds of states as well\nas the correlations these states give rise to will be investigated in chapter 6 and we\nwill give many necessary separability conditions and sufficient entanglement criteria\nusing Bell-type inequalities. However, since the quantum body is not a polytope\nwe do not restrict ourselves to linear Bell-type inequalities. We will therefore also\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n35\n\nlook at quadratic expressions in hA1 * * * AN i so as to give inequalities that bound\nthe quantum body. These will be called quadratic Bell-type inequalities.\nWe will restrict the investigation of linear and quadratic Bell-type inequalities\nto those cases where each of the N parties measures two different dichotomous\nobservables. For such a scenario the following important result holds [Toner and\nVerstraete, 2006], cf. [Masanes, 2005]: the maximum quantum value of any such\nBell-type inequality is achieved by a quantum state of N -qubits (i.e., N spin- 21\nparticles, that each have a two dimensional Hilbert space H = C2 ). Furthermore,\none can assume this state to have only real coefficients and that the operators\ncorresponding to the observables are real and traceless. These are self-adjoint operators and they give a so-called projector valued measure (PVM) so one does not\nneed consider the more general POVM operators. Such observables are in fact spin\nobservables in some direction. These can be represented using the Pauli spin obP\nservables as follows: A = a * \u03c3 = i ai \u03c3i , with kak = 1, i = x, y, z and \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z\nthe familiar Pauli spin operators on H = C2 . Accordingly, the two different types of\ninvestigation mentioned above will be performed only for the case of qubits, and for\nthe case of spin observables. In the next section these investigations will be further\nintroduced.\n2.3.2.1\n\nOn the (non-)locality, entanglement and separability of quantum states\n\nLet us first take a closer look at entanglement and separability of quantum states,\nafter which we discuss the locality properties of these states.\nA bi-partite quantum state \u03c1sep on H = H1 \u2297 H2 is separable iff [Werner, 1989]\nit can be written as\nX\n\u03c1sep =\npi \u03c11i \u2297 \u03c12i ,\n(2.32)\ni\n\nP\n\n1\n2\nwith\ni pi = 1 and pi \u2265 0, and where \u03c1i and \u03c1i are states for party 1 and 2\nrespectively. A state is called entangled when it is not separable. Entanglement\nis due to the tensor product structure of a composite Hilbert space and the linear\nsuperposition principle of quantum mechanics. It has been the focus of a lot of\nresearch over the past decade, see Horodecki et al. [2007] for a recent very extensive\noverview.\nA separable state is supposed to contain only classical correlations. A physical\ninterpretation of separability can be given in terms of the resources needed for the\npreparation of the state: an entangled state cannot be prepared from two previously non-interacting systems using local operations and classical communication\n(LOCC operations17 ). The LOCC operations are a subset of all separable operP\nations [Horodecki et al., 2007] that can be represented as S(\u03c1) = i L\u2020 \u03c1L with\nP \u2020\ni Li Li \u2264 1 and where Li is a product of local operations performed by each of\n17 See\n\nsection 10.4.2 for a detailed specification of the class of LOCC operations.\n\n\f36\n\nChapter 2\n\nthe parties, i.e., Li = L1i \u2297 L2i \u2297 * * * , where each Lji (j = 1, 2, . . . , N ) is some positive\noperator that takes states to states. The effect of such a separable operation on a\nstate \u03c1\u0303 = \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 , that describes the two previously non-interacting systems, is as\nfollows\nX\n(L1i \u2297 L2i )\u2020 (\u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 )(L1i \u2297 L2i )\nS(\u03c1\u0303) =\ni\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nL1i \u03c11 L1i \u2297 L2i \u03c12 L2i =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03c1\u03031i \u2297 \u03c1\u03032i ,\n\n(2.33)\n\n\u2020\n\nwith \u03c1\u03031i = L1i \u03c11 L1i and \u03c1\u03032i = L2i \u03c12 L2i which are not necessarily normalized. The\nfinal state is a separable state so separable operations, and consequently LOCC\noperations, cannot create any entanglement.\nAll correlations obtainable using a separable state can be reproduced by local\ncorrelations as defined above in (2.11). For completeness, let us prove this for bipartite correlations. The N -partite generalization follows straightforward from the\nbi-partite proof. Consider the separable state (2.32) and the quantum correlations\n(2.14) this state gives rise to. These can be rewritten as\nX\npi Tr[MaA11 \u03c11i ]Tr[MaA22 \u03c12i ]\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) = Tr[MaA11 \u2297 MaA22 \u03c1sep ] =\ni\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\npi P (a1 |A1 , i)P (a2 |A2 , i),\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere P (a1 |A1 , i) is the probability to find outcome a1 when measuring A1 on the\nstate \u03c11i of party 1, and analogous for P (a2 |A2 , i). The bi-partite local correlations\nR\nare P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) = \u039b d\u03bbp(\u03bb)P (a1 |A1 , \u03bb)P (a2 |A2 , \u03bb), as in (2.11). If one chooses\nthe hidden variable \u03bb to be the index i and the distribution p(\u03bb) to be the discrete\ndistribution pi , one reproduces the quantum correlations that the separable state\ngives rise in terms of local correlations. This ends the proof.\nLet us move to non-separable, i.e., entangled states. Suppose a state is entangled,\ncan we say how much entangled it is? This asks for the possibility of quantifying\nentanglement using some measure. However this appears to very difficult. Already\nfor bi-partite systems many such measures exist. One way to see why there seems\nnot to be a unique measure of entanglement is by noting that entanglement is not\nan observable. It can not be regarded a physical observable in the sense that there\nis no self-adjoint operator such that the value of an entanglement measure can be\nobtained by measuring the expectation value of the operator, for any state of the\ncomposite system. This can be seen as follows [Mintert, 2006]. Entanglement is\ninvariant under all local unitary operations. That is, for a given state | \u03c80 i on\nH = H1 \u2297 H2 , all states | \u03c8i = U1 \u2297 U2 | \u03c80 i with arbitrary unitary interaction by\nparty 1 and 2 have exactly the same entanglement properties. The same holds for\nmixed states \u03c1. Hence, any observable E that is supposed to quantify entanglement\nneeds to have the same symmetry E = U1\u2020 \u2297 U2\u2020 E U1 \u2297 U2 for arbitrary local\nunitaries. However, the only operator that has this property is the identity operator\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n37\n\n1 [Mintert, 2006]. But that is the trivial observable returning a value of 1 for all\nstates independent of their entanglement characteristics.\nThus in order to characterize entanglement on needs to measure more than just\none observable. We will however not be concerned with entanglement measures but\nwith the task of determining whether a state is entangled or not. This is the socalled separability problem: Given a certain state how can one determine whether\nit is entangled? Of course, one may try to determine the state exactly using full tomography and then try and see if a decomposition of the form (2.32) exists, but this\nis problematic since no general algorithm exists for such a decomposition. Only in\nsimple cases a necessary and sufficient criterion for entanglement exists which is the\nso-called positive partial transposition (PPT) criterion [Peres, 1996; Horodecki et\nal., 1996] that works only up to dimension six of the Hilbert space for the combined\nsystem (i.e., two qubits and a qubit and qutrit). However, the PPT criterion is not\nexperimentally accessible because partial transposition is not a physical operation.\nFurthermore, full tomography is experimentally very demanding.\nOther experimentally accessible necessary separability conditions have therefore\nbeen proposed whose violation is a sufficient condition for entanglement detection.\nThese have been termed entanglement witnesses [Horodecki et al., 1996; Terhal,\n1996; Lewenstein et al., 2000; Bruss et al., 2002]. An entanglement witness is a self\nadjoint operator that upon measurement gives a sufficient criterion for the existence\nof entanglement. Local Bell-type inequalities are such entanglement witnesses. Indeed, we have already seen that violation of the local CHSH inequality is sufficient\nfor detection of bi-partite entanglement. This is the case for all local Bell-type inequalities since, as proven above, the correlations of a separable quantum state can\nalways be reproduced by local correlations. Thus violating the inequalities is sufficient for detecting entanglement. But unfortunately it appears not to be necessary,\nbecause not all entangled states can be made to violate a local Bell-type inequality.\nThis already shows up in violations of the CHSH inequality: all pure entangled\nstates can be made to violate the CHSH inequality (2.19) [Gisin and Peres, 1992;\nPopescu and Rohrlich, 1992a], but for mixed states this is not the case. The latter\nfeature is called hidden non-locality [Popescu, 1995], because using preprocessing via\nlocal filtering techniques it can eventually be made to a violate the CHSH inequality with some non-zero probability. In the multi-partite setting the entanglement\nstructure already appears to be very different since there even pure entangled states\nexist that do not violate any of the local Bell-type inequalities from the WWZB set\n[\u017bukowski and Brukner, 2002], that for N = 2 reduce to the CHSH inequality.\nSince it suffices for detecting entanglement of a quantum state to show that a\nquantum state is non-local, it is important to know when it is non-local. But how\ncan one show this? One way of proving this is to show that no local model exists\nfor all correlations the quantum state gives rise to. This has been achieved only for\nquantum states with high symmetry such as the so-called Werner states [Werner,\n1989]. One might also ask the weaker question whether no local models exists for\nall correlations the state gives rise to, given a certain number of measurements and\n\n\f38\n\nChapter 2\n\noutcomes. This implies the quantum state should violate any of the local Bell-type\ninequalities for this case. But for a given state it is extremely hard to find a local\nBell-type inequality and measurements such that the inequality is violated. Only\nfor the two qubits and the CHSH inequality this has been solved analytically by\nHorodecki et al. [1995].\nTo end this section we will show that the property of separability of quantum states depends on the chosen decomposition H = H1 \u2297 H2 of the total state\nspace H (of the combined system) into a tensor product of H1 and H2 , the latter being the state spaces of the two subsystems. Usually such a decomposition\nis given from the start, but what if only the state space of the combined system\nis known? Separability of states then might depend on the particular decomposition that is chosen. Indeed, states exist that are separable with respect to one\ndecomposition H = H1 \u2297 H2 but that are inseparable with respect to another decomposition of H into H = H1\u2032 \u2297 H2\u2032 , as the following example shows. Consider\na six dimensional Hilbert space H = C6 and assume the following separable state\n(| 0i + | 1i) \u2297 (| 0i + | 2i)/2 on the decomposition C2 \u2297 C3 using the basis {| 0i, | 1i}\nand {| 0i, | 1i, | 2i} respectively. Surprisingly, this state is inseparable on the decomposition C3 \u2297 C2 . This can be verified using the positive partial transposition\n(PPT) criterion which is a necessary and sufficient separability criterion for these\ntwo cases. States that are separable under any decomposition of the total state\nspace are called 'absolutely separable' [Ku\u015b and \u017byczkowski, 2001]. In all cases to\nbe considered the decomposition of the state space of the multi-partite system is\ngiven from the outset (we are dealing with N -qubits) so the question of absolute\nseparability will not be relevant to our investigations.\n\n2.4\n\nPitfalls when using Bell-type polynomials to\nderive Bell-type inequalities\n\nIn this section we will comment on a pitfall that lures in the background when\nusing Bell-type polynomials to obtain Bell-type inequalities for LHV models. This\nexposition is inspired by an attempt to expose the flaw in the derivation of a recent\nBell-type inequality for LHV models by Chen [2006]. See Seevinck [2007b] for the\ndetailed critique.\nChen [2006] claimed \"exponential violation of local realism by separable states\",\nin the sense that multi-partite separable quantum states are supposed to give rise to\ncorrelations and fluctuations that violate a Bell-type inequality that Chen claims to\nbe obeyed by LHV models. However, this claim can not be true since all correlations\nseparable quantum states give rise to have a description in terms of local correlations\nand thus satisfy all Bell-type inequalities for LHV models, and this holds for all\nnumber of parties. (This was explicitly proven above for N = 2). We will expose\nthe flaw in Chen's reasoning, not merely for clarification of this issue, but perhaps\neven more importantly since it re-teaches us an old lesson J.S. Bell taught us over\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n39\n\n40 years ago, although in a different form. We will argue that this lesson provides us\nwith a new morale especially relevant to modern research in Bell-type inequalities\nand thus also for the research of this dissertation. It is not important to go into\nthe details of Chen's work, and for clarity we will not use a multi-partite but a\ntwo-partite setting.\nConsider the standard Gedankenexperiment where one considers two systems\nthat each are distributed to one of two parties who measure two different dichotomous observables on the respective subsystem they have in their possession. Next\nconsider the CHSH polynomial of (2.18) that reads Bchsh = AB +AB \u2032 +A\u2032 B \u2212A\u2032 B \u2032 ,\nwhere for clarity we have written A, A\u2032 and B, B \u2032 for the observables instead of\nA1 , A\u20321 and A2 , A\u20322 . Also for clarity we denote the quantum mechanical version of\nthe CHSH polynomial by the Bell-operator B\u0302chsh , and the quantum observables\nby the operators \u00c2, \u00c2\u2032 , B\u0302, B\u0302 \u2032 . Consider now a separable two-qubit state \u03c1sep on\nH = C2 \u2297 C2 and local orthogonal spin observables: \u00c2 \u22a5 \u00c2\u2032 and B\u0302 \u22a5 B\u0302 \u2032 . Note that\nsuch local orthogonal spin-observables anti-commute: {\u00c2, \u00c2\u2032 } = 0 and {B\u0302, B\u0302 \u2032 } = 0.\nChen considered the quantities (B\u0302chsh )2 and (Bchsh )2 and calculated the bounds on\nthese quantities as determined by separable states and local correlations respectively.\nUsing the fact that the operators that correspond to the local quantum mechanical observables anti-commute one obtains\n(B\u0302chsh )2 = (\u00c22 + \u00c2\u20322 ) \u2297 (B\u0302 2 + B\u0302 \u20322 ) \u2212 4(\u00c2\u00c2\u2032 \u2297 B\u0302 B\u0302 \u2032 )\n= (\u00c22 + \u00c2\u20322 ) \u2297 (B\u0302 2 + B\u0302 \u20322 ) + 4(\u00c2\u2032\u2032 \u2297 B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(2.35)\n\nwith \u00c2\u2032\u2032 = [\u00c2, \u00c2\u2032 ]/2i and B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 = [B\u0302, B\u0302 \u2032 ]/2i spin observables orthogonal to both A, A\u2032\nand B, B \u2032 respectively. However, in the local realist case where the local observables\nare not anti-commuting operators on a Hilbert space but some functions that take\non values that represent measurement outcomes and therefore commute, one obtains\n(Bchsh )2 = (A2 + A\u20322 )(B 2 + B \u20322 ) + 2AA\u2032 (B 2 \u2212 B \u20322 ) + 2BB \u2032 (A2 \u2212 A\u20322 ).\n\n(2.36)\n\nUsing linearity of the mean to determine the expectation values of both (Bchsh )2\nand (B\u0302chsh )2 one obtains that local correlations give |h(Bchsh )2 ilhv | \u2264 4, whereas\nseparable quantum states are able to give |h(B\u0302chsh )2 iqm | = 8. It thus appears that\nseparable states can give correlations that are much stronger than local correlations,\nhence the original claim by Chen. However, somewhere something must have gone\nastray since we know that all predictions separable states can give rise to can be\nmimicked by local correlations.\nThe first thing to note is that, despite the formal similarity of the expressions\n(Bchsh )2 and (B\u0302chsh )2 (i.e., when not expanded in terms of observables), expressions\n(2.36) and (2.35) cannot be considered to be counterparts of each other in case the\nfirst is supposed to be the Bell-type polynomial for LHV models and the second\nfor quantum mechanics. The correct counterpart of (B\u0302chsh )2 for LHV models is\nobtained by translating (2.35) directly into\ne = (A2 + A\u20322 )(B 2 + B \u20322 ) + 4A\u2032\u2032 B \u2032\u2032 ,\nB\n(2.37)\n\n\f40\n\nChapter 2\n\nwith A\u2032\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 some dichotomic \u00b11 valued observables that are the local realistic\ncounterpart of the observables that correspond to operators \u00c2\u2032\u2032 and B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 respectively.\ne lhv | \u2264 8, so we see that the\nFor local correlations one obtains the tight bound |hBi\ncorrelations separable states can give rise to can indeed be retrieved using local\ne (and not (Bchsh )2 ) is the Bell-polynomial that, when\ncorrelations. The functional B\naveraged over and using linearity of the mean, gives the Bell-type inequality which\nis the counterpart of the quantum mechanical inequality using (B\u0302chsh )2 .\nBut what actually went wrong in considering (B\u0302chsh )2 and (Bchsh )2 to be the\ncorrect counterparts for quantum and local correlations respectively? Here we recall\na lesson J.S. Bell taught us many years ago.\nFirst we note that it is of course not Bchsh that is measured but the observables A, A\u2032 and B, B \u2032 . However, the quantum mechanical counterparts of Bell-type\npolynomials (i.e., in terms of the operators associated to the observables), such\nas the Bell-operator B\u0302chsh , can be considered to be observables themselves since a\nsum of self-adjoint operators is again self-adjoint and every self-adjoint operator is\nsupposed to correspond to an observable. Furthermore, the additivity of operators\ngives additivity of expectation values. Thus the Tsirelson inequality\n\u221a\n(2.38)\n|h\u00c2B\u0302iqm + h\u00c2B\u0302 \u2032 iqm + h\u00c2\u2032 B\u0302iqm \u2212 h\u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2032 iqm | \u2264 2 2\ncan equally well be expressed in a shorthand notation as\n\u221a\n|h\u00c2B\u0302 + \u00c2B\u0302 \u2032 + \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2212 \u00c2\u2032 B\u0302 \u2032 iqm | = |hB\u0302chsh iqm | \u2264 2 2.\n\n(2.39)\n\nHowever, as noted by Bell: \"A measurement of a sum of noncommuting observables cannot be made by combining trivially the results of separate observations on\nthe two terms \u2013 it requires a quite distinct experiment. [. . . ] But this explanation\nof the nonadditivity of allowed values also established the non-triviality of the additivity of expectation values. The latter is quite a peculiar property of quantum\nmechanical states, not to be expected a priori. There is no reason to demand it individually of the hypothetical dispersion free states [hidden-variable states \u03bb], whose\nfunction it is to reproduce the measurable peculiarities of quantum mechanics when\naveraged over.\" [Bell, 1966]18. If we apply Bell's lesson to the Gedankenexperiment\nconsidered here we realize that because the CHSH polynomial Bchsh contains incompatible observables it cannot be measured by combining trivially the results of\n18 Note, however, that for Bell the crucial point is not that eigenvalues of self-adjoint observables\ndo not obey the additivity rule (he gave an example using spin observables), but that the additivity\nrule in the case of incompatible observables cannot be justified in the light of the Bohrian point\nthat the context of measurement plays a role in defining quantum reality: \"They [the additivity\nrule] are seen to be quite unreasonable when one remembers with Bohr 'the impossibility of any\nsharp distinction between the behaviour of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring\ninstruments which serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear'.\" [Bell,\n1966]. (Bell cites N. Bohr here.) Analogously, what is important for our discussion here is not\nsome additivity rule but that a specific inference on the hidden-variable level between incompatible\nobservables cannot be justified in the light of the Bohrian point Bell referred to\n\n\fOn correlations: Definitions and general framework\n\n41\n\nseparate observations on the different terms in the polynomial \u2013 it requires a quite\ndistinct experiment, one that is not part of the original Gedankenexperiment.\nThe hidden variables \u03bb only determine the probabilities for outcomes of the\nindividual measurements of A, A\u2032 , B, B \u2032 and not probabilities for outcomes of measurement of the quantity Bchsh since measurement of the latter would require quite a\ndistinct experiment because it involves incompatible observables A and A\u2032 for party\n1 and B and B \u2032 for party 2. The only function of the CHSH polynomial Bchsh is to\nprovide a shorthand notation of the CHSH inequality. Indeed, when averaged over \u03bb\nit gives the inequality |hBchsh ilhv | \u2264 2, which, by using linearity of the mean, can be\nrewritten as a sum of expectation values in a legitimate local realistic form, namely\nas the legitimate Bell-type inequality |hABilhv +hAB \u2032 ilhv +hA\u2032 Bilhv \u2212hA\u2032 B \u2032 ilhv | \u2264 2\nthat local realism must satisfy. Indeed, all expectation values in this Bell-type inequality involve only compatible quantities, and no incompatible ones. Therefore,\nthe hidden-variable counterpart of the quantum mechanical operator B\u0302chsh can be\nsafely chosen to be the Bell-polynomial Bchsh , and vice versa.\nLet us now consider the expressions (Bchsh )2 and (B\u0302chsh )2 . The reason why Bchsh\nand B\u0302chsh give a legitimate shortcut formulation for a Bell-type inequality whereas\n(Bchsh )2 and (B\u0302chsh )2 do not, is that the latter two cannot be written as an expression involving expectation values of the observables A, A\u2032 , B, B \u2032 (or \u00c2, \u00c2\u2032 , B\u0302, B\u0302 \u2032 )\nvia a legitimate operation such as linearity of the mean, whereas the first two can.\nMeasurement of (Bchsh )2 , and (B\u0302chsh )2 in the quantum case, requires measurement\nof observables A\u2032\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 , corresponding to \u00c2\u2032\u2032 and B\u0302 \u2032\u2032 in the quantum case, that\nare not part of the Gedankenexperiment.\nAssuming that measurement of (Bchsh )2 involves measurement of only A, A\u2032\nand B, B \u2032 , as is implied by (2.36), ignores the incompatibility of the observables\ninvolved in expressions such as AA\u2032 , etc. In quantum theory, however, \u00c2\u00c2\u2032 happens\nto determine another self adjoint observable \u00c2\u2032\u2032 via [\u00c2, \u00c2\u2032 ]/2i = \u00c2\u2032\u2032 . Measurement\nof the product of the incompatible observables \u00c2 and \u00c2\u2032 is therefore taken care\nof by the quantum formalism itself19 . Not so for the hidden-variable formalism,\nwhere one must introduce a new observable A\u2032\u2032 that on the hidden-variable level\nhas no relationship to A and A\u2032 . There is no reason whatsoever to presuppose an\nalgebraic relation between the individual outcomes of measurement of these three\nobservables.\nWe finally see where things have gone astray in deriving that |h(Bchsh )2 ilhv | \u2264 4,\nalthough separable quantum states are able to give |h(B\u0302chsh )2 iqm | = 8. It is not\nthe strength of correlations in separable states which ruled out local realism, but\n\"[i]t was the arbitrary assumption of a particular (and impossible) relation between\nhe results of incompatible measurements either of which might be made on a given\noccasion but only one of which can in fact be made.\"[Bell, 1966]\nLet us recapitulate and discuss the subtleties that must be taken care of (also in\nthis dissertation) when deriving Bell-type inequalities using a shorthand notation\n19 In\n\nfact, it is only the product \u00c2\u00c2\u2032 \u2297 B\u0302 B\u0302 \u2032 of (2.35) that is again self-adjoint and can be taken\nto correspond to an observable, not necessarily the terms \u00c2\u00c2\u2032 and B\u0302 B\u0302 \u2032 themselves.\n\n\f42\n\nChapter 2\n\nin terms of Bell-type polynomials.\n(I) Firstly, the Bell polynomials are not to be regarded as observables. In general\nthey contain incompatible observables (however, see (III) below). The difficulty\nof measuring incompatible observables has to be explicitly taken into account in\nthe hidden-variable expression. Only in quantum mechanics this incompatibility\nstructure is already captured in the (non-)commutativity structure of the operators\nthat correspond to the observables in question.\n(II) Secondly, when using a shorthand notation in terms of Bell-polynomials it\nmust be possible (by for example using linearity of the mean) to translate the shorthand notation into a legitimate Bell-type inequality in terms of expectation values\nof compatible observables that are actually considered in the Gedankenexperiment.\n(III) Thirdly, suppose one would indeed regard the functionals Bchsh to be the\nquantities of interest and regard them as observables. The first subtlety mentioned\nabove shows that this is unproblematic only if they are thought of as being genuine\nirreducible observables and not to be composed out of a sum of other incompatible\nobservables. But one then considers a different experiment. To be fair to local\nrealism from the start the possible values of measurement of, for example, the\nobservable Bchsh in the local hidden-variable model should then be equal to the\neigenvalues of the\n\u221a mechanical counterpart B\u0302chsh . And these eigenvalues\n\u221a quantum\nof B\u0302chsh are {2 2, \u22122 2, 0} respectively. The possible outcomes for the local\nrealist quantities should equal these eigenvalues. Indeed, predictions for a single\nobservation can always be mimicked by a local hidden-variable model.\n\n\fII\n\nBi-partite correlations\n\n\f\fChapter 3\n\n45\n\nLocal realism, hidden variables\nand correlations\nThis chapter is partly based on Seevinck [2008a].\n\n3.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the first part of this chapter we will mainly investigate what assumptions suffice\nin deriving the original CHSH inequality |hBchsh i| \u2264 2 for the case of two parties and\ntwo dichotomous observables per party. It is well-known that all local correlations\nobey this inequality (i.e., |hBchsh ilhv | \u2264 2) but here we will show that many more\ncorrelations not of the local form also obey this inequality. In section 3.2 we start by\nreviewing the fact that the doctrine of local realism that assumes free variables and\nallows for local measurement contextuality in the form of measurement apparatus\nhidden variables must obey the CHSH inequality both in the case of deterministic\nand stochastic models. In the derivation for stochastic models two conditions, first\ndistinguished by Jarrett [1984], are used to give a factorisability condition that enables the derivation to go through. Jarrett called them Completeness and Locality,\nalthough we will follow a different terminology. These conditions are more general\nthan the well-known conditions of Outcome Independence and Parameter Independence of Shimony [1986]. These latter conditions taken together give a condition\ncalled Factorisability, sometimes also referred to as Local Causality (terminology by\nBell [1976]), that also suffices to obtain the CHSH inequality. The Shimony conditions follow from the Jarrett conditions when averaged over measurement apparatus\nhidden variables. In subsection 3.2.4 we briefly comment on the crucial difference\nbetween these two sets of conditions and argue that they should not be conflated.\nIn the following subsection, subsection 3.2.5 we review the fact that the Shimony\nconditions are not the only two conditions that imply Factorisability. Two different\nconditions, first distinguished by Maudlin [1994], also suffice. Although Maudlin's\n\n\f46\n\nChapter 3\n\nconditions are well-known, we have not been able to find a proof in the literature\nthat they indeed imply Factorisability and therefore we give such a proof here\n(in the Appendix on p. 86). We briefly comment on the consequences of this\nnon-uniqueness for interpreting violations of the CHSH inequality. It has been\nargued that this undermines the activity called experimental metaphysics where\none draws grand metaphysical conclusions based on the idea that in violations of\nthe CHSH inequality compliance with relativity forces Outcome Independence to\nbe violated rather than Parameter Independence. We can only partly agree that\nthis undermines the starting point of experimental metaphysics because Maudlin\nneeds extra assumptions to evaluate his conditions in quantum mechanics. We also\nreview two other arguments against this activity and present in the next section,\nsection 3.3, another difficulty for this activity.\nIn this section we go back to the CHSH inequality and show that both in the\ndeterministic and stochastic case one can allow explicit non-local setting and outcome dependence as well as dependence of the hidden variables on the settings\n(i.e., the observables are no longer free variables), and still derive the CHSH inequality. Violations of the CHSH inequality thus rule out a much broader class of\nhidden-variable models than is generally thought. This shows that the conditions\nof Outcome Independence and Parameter Independence, that taken together imply\nthe condition of Factorisability, can both be violated in deriving the inequality, i.e.,\nthey are not necessary for this inequality to obtain, but only sufficient. Therefore,\nwe have no reason to expect either one of them to hold solely on the basis of the\nCHSH inequality, i.e., satisfaction of the inequality is not sufficient for claiming that\neither one holds.\nIn section 3.3.4 we compare our findings to a recent non-local model by Leggett\n[2003] that violates the CHSH inequality, but which obeys a different Bell-type\ninequality that is violated by quantum mechanics. The discussion of Leggett's\nmodel will show an interesting relationship between different assumptions at different hidden-variable levels. In this model parameter dependence at the deeper\nhidden-variable level does not show up as parameter dependence at the higher\nhidden-variable level (where one integrates over a deeper level hidden-variable), but\nonly as outcome dependence, i.e., as a violation of Outcome Independence. This\nshows that which conditions are obeyed and which are not depends on the level\nof consideration. A conclusive picture therefore depends on which hidden-variable\nlevel is considered to be fundamental.\nIn section 3.4 we will extend our investigation from the hidden-variable level\n(i.e., the level of subsurface probabilities where one conditions on the hidden variables \u03bb) to the level of surface probabilities. We will present interesting analogies\nbetween different inferences that can be made on each of these two levels. The most\ninteresting such analogy is between, on the one hand, the subsurface inference that\nthe condition of Parameter Independence and violation of Factorisability implies\nrandomness at the hidden-variable level, and, on the other hand, the surface inference that any non-local correlation that is no-signaling must be indeterministic,\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n47\n\nas was recently proven by Masanes et al. [2006]. An interesting corollary of this\nis that any deterministic hidden-variable theory that obeys no-signaling and gives\nnon-local correlations must show randomness on the surface, i.e., the surface probabilities cannot be deterministic. The determinism thus stays beneath the surface;\nthe hidden variables cannot be perfectly controllable because the outcomes must\nshow randomness at the surface. We show that Bohmian mechanics is in perfect\nagreement with this conclusion.\nIn section 3.5 we remain at the level of surface probabilities and further investigate the no-signaling correlations. We first show that an alleged no-signaling\nBell-type inequality as proposed by Roy and Singh [1989] is in fact trivially true.\nWe next derive a non-trivial no-signaling inequality in terms of expectation values.\nIn doing, so we must go beyond the analysis used in deriving the CHSH inequality,\nbecause, as has been shown in the previous chapter, this inequality is trivial for\nno-signaling correlations. In the 4-dimensional space of product expectation values\nhABi, hA\u2032 Bi, etc., the no-signaling polytope contains only trivial facets. We therefore consider the larger space of both product and marginal expectation values (i.e.,\n\u2032\nincluding also hAiB , hAiB , etc.).\nIn the last section, section 3.6, we discuss a few of the most interesting open\nproblems which have emerged from the investigations in this chapter. An investigation of quantum correlations (for both entangled and separable states) with respect\nto the CHSH inequality is postponed to the next two chapters. This chapter concentrates on local, non-local and no-signaling correlations.\nA list of acronyms used in this chapter can be found in section 3.8 on page 92.\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nLocal realism and standard derivation of the\nCHSH inequality\nLocal realism and free variables\n\nIt is commonly accepted that the assumptions of local realism together with the\nrequirement that observables can be regarded as free variables ensure that deterministic and stochastic hidden-variable theories obey the CHSH inequality. To\nappreciate this statement we must be precise about the notions involved in this\nstatement. A great deal has been written about these notions; here we rely heavily\non Clifton et al. [1991] which in our opinion gives a very clear exposition.\nRealism is the idea that (i) physical systems exist independently and (ii) posses\nintrinsic properties that can be described by states. It is further assumed that these\nstates together with the state of the measurement apparatus completely account for\noutcomes of measurements and/or their statistics (i.e., probabilities of outcomes).\nThe independently existing states are usually called hidden variables, and we will\nfollow suit for historical reasons, although there are good reasons to call them\ndifferently. Indeed, Clifton et al. [1991] call them 'existents', while Bell [1987] at\n\n\f48\n\nChapter 3\n\nsome point calls them 'beables'.\nLocality we take to be the idea that there exists no spacelike causation [Clifton\net al., 1991], i.e., the outcomes of measurement do not depend on what happens\nin a spacelike separated region. Furthermore, the causal history of measurement\ndevices is supposed to be sufficiently disentangled from other measurement devices\nthat are spacelike separated and from the systems to be measured in the backward\nlightcones of the measurement events. ('sufficiently' in the sense that at least the\nindependence conditions to be given below hold.)\nThe notion of 'free variables' [Bell, 1987] means that the settings used to measure\nobservables can be chosen freely, i.e., this excludes conspiracy theories such as superdeterminism, as well as retro-causal interactions. The assumption that one deals\nwith free variables is also called the 'freedom assumption', see e.g. [Gill et al., 2002]\nfor a clear exposition.\nModels that assume local realism and that settings are free variables are called\nlocal hidden-variable (LHV) models.\n\na = +1\n\nb = +1\nA, \u03bcA\n\nB, \u03bcB\n\na = \u22121\n\nb = \u22121\nb\u2032 = +1\n\nII\n\na\u2032 = +1\n\nI\nA,\u2032 \u03bcA\u2032\n\nB,\u2032 \u03bcB\u2032\nb\u2032\n\n= \u22121\n\na\u2032 = \u22121\n\n\u03bb\n\nApparatus that\nmeasures subsystem II\n\nSource\n\nApparatus that\nmeasures subsystem I\n\nFigure 3.1: Setup of the Gedankenexperiment.\n\nConsider now the following Gedankenexperiment (see Figure 3.1) where two\ndifferent measurements with settings A (or A\u2032 ) and B (or B \u2032 ) are performed on\na certain physical system consisting of two parts (or subsystems) called I and II\nrespectively, that have originated from a common source. One can think of a spin\nmeasurement on system consisting of two spins that are created in some decay\nprocess. On part I observables corresponding to settings A or A\u2032 are measured and\non part II observables corresponding to settings B or B \u2032 . Denote the outcomes of\nA and B by a and b respectively (and similarly for A\u2032 and B \u2032 ). They are assumed\nto be dichotomic, i.e., a = \u00b11, b = \u00b11.\nIt is assumed that the measurement apparata are spacelike separated and that\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n49\n\nthe settings are fixed just prior to the respective measurement interactions. Let\nthe hidden variable \u03bb denote the complete state (set of states) in the entire causal\nhistory of the two subsystems prior to the measurement interactions1 . Note the\ngenerality of this characterization; it allows for stochastic as well as deterministic\ndetermination, the hidden variables can be anything and it allows for all possible\ndynamical evolutions of the system and its subsystems. Furthermore, let the hidden\nvariables \u03bcA and \u03bcB denote the states of the complete causal history of the measurement apparata prior to any measurement of A on system I and B on system II\nrespectively. These apparatus hidden variables of course include the (macroscopic)\nsettings A and B which are assumed to be fixed just prior to the measurement interactions. However, since these are assumed to be under control of the experimenter,\nthey will nevertheless be explicitly notated. The degrees of freedom that do not incorporate the setting may well be coupled to the those that characterize the setting.\nWe incorporate this possible dependence by letting the apparatus hidden variables\ndepend on the settings. We thus write \u03bcA , \u03bcB instead of \u03bcI , \u03bcII , respectively.\nThe experiment is assumed to be performed many times on a large collection\nor ensemble of systems (each comprising of two subsystems I and II), where each\nexperiment is performed on a single system in this collection. The choice of different\nsettings (A or A\u2032 and B or B \u2032 ) in each run of the experiment is assumed to be\nmade independently. By standard sampling arguments the average of the actual\ndata measured for a given pair of settings on a subset of the total set of measured\nsystems, equals, for a large enough subset (i.e., enough runs of the experiment), the\naverage that would be obtained for all systems if they had been measured with the\nsame pair of settings.\nAssuming realism\nIt is assumed that \u03bb, together with the states of the apparata, determines the\noutcomes of measurement of any possible observable that can be measured. This\nis justified by the idea of realism: the intrinsic properties possessed by the system\nare described by a physical state (this is taken to be the hidden variable state\n\u03bb) and therefore the outcomes of measurement of all possible observables (that are\nsupposed to be reveal intrinsic properties) are dictated by \u03bb and perhaps also by the\ndetails of the measurement apparatus. Note that we also allow for the case where\nit is not the outcomes, but only their probabilities of occurring that are dictated,\nsee below.\nIn order to derive Bell-type inequalities, we will consider relations among various\nhypothetical outcomes of a single experiment to be performed at a single time in one\nof several possible versions. However, in a real experiment one considers outcomes\nof several different versions of an experiment, all of which were actually performed\n1 This specification of \u03bb to be the complete state in the entire causal history of the subsystems\nis more general than a specification of \u03bb as the state of the subsystems at a specific instant in time,\nsuch as the time of origination from the source. For a discussion of advantages of this specification\nover other specifications, see [Clifton et al., 1991; Butterfield, 1989].\n\n\f50\n\nChapter 3\n\nat various different times. These actual outcomes are connected to the hypothetical\noutcomes in a hidden-variable model via the following conjecture which is motivated\nby the idea of realism. Rephrasing Mermin [2004, p. 2] this conjecture is that every\none of the possible outcomes (or their probabilities of occurring) for every one of\nthe possible choices one might make for the settings (A or A\u2032 and B or B \u2032 ) in a\nsingle experiment performed at a single time are all predetermined by properties\nof the system (and measurement apparata), with one (and only one) of those predetermined outcomes actually being revealed \u2013 namely the one associated with the\nparticular choice of experiment actually made. This allows us to consider the same\nhidden variable \u03bb when considering outcomes of two incompatible observables (e.g.,\nA and A\u2032 ) that each require a distinct experiment in order to be measured2 .\nThe preparation of the complete set of hidden variables cannot be assumed to\nbe perfectly controllable. Therefore, if one wants to make contact with statistics\nobserved on ensembles of identical experiments (same settings, although the hidden variables may differ and in general will differ since they are uncontrollable),\none must assume that for such an ensemble the hidden variables have some normalized distribution. Consequently, the advocate of local realism has to use some\ndistribution representing ignorance about which hidden variables exist in a particular experiment. This distribution is notated as \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B), which is the\ndistribution of the hidden variables given a specific setting A, B.\nAssuming locality and free variables\nAssume that in the local-realist framework the settings are free variables. We now\nstate some conditions that we take to follow from this assumption. Whether it is\nindeed the case that the doctrine of local realism supplemented with the assumption\nof free variables imply these conditions is not crucial for our investigation. We could\nequally well assume these conditions independently, since it is the conjunction of\nthese conditions we are concerned with, not the question what a sufficient motivation\nfor them is.\nThat the settings are free variables implies that they are statistically independent\nfrom the system hidden variables. This results in the requirement of Independence\nof the Systems (IS):\nIS :\n\n\u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bb), \u2200\u03bb, A, B.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis implies that \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B)\u03c1(\u03bb), \u2200\u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B. Further, locality implies that the distribution of the apparatus hidden variables at one\nmeasurement station are independent of what happens at the other measurement\nstation. This results in the following conditions called Apparatus Factorisability\n2 We do not consider the possibility where this does not suffice and where something like a\ncommon common cause is needed, cf. Butterfield [2007].\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n51\n\n(AF) and Apparatus Locality (AL): for all \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B\nAF :\nAL :\n\n\u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A, B) \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B),\n\n\u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A) and \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B),\n\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nThe probability densities \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A, B, ), etc. are defined as the marginals of the\ndensity \u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B, ) and are all assumed to be positive and normalized.\nThe conjunction of AF and AL gives Total Apparatus Factorisability (TAF):\nTAF : \u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A)\u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B),\n\n\u2200\u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B.\n\n(3.4)\n\nIf we now take the conjunction of TAF and IS we finally obtain the condition of\nIndependence of the Systems and Apparata (ISA):\nISA : \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A)\u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B)\u03c1(\u03bb),\n\n\u2200\u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B. (3.5)\n\nThis condition guarantees independence of measurement apparata from distant\nspacelike apparatus hidden variables and settings, as well as independence of the\n(sub-) system states \u03bb from the settings.\nModels of the above Gedankenexperiment are usually divided into two kinds:\ndeterministic and stochastic. The first kind of model uses the idea that the hidden\nvariables determine the outcomes of measurements. Probabilities only enter as\nclassical probability functions, denoted by P , on the set M of all hidden variables.\nPhysical quantities are defined as functions on this set. Usually this set is taken\nto be a phase space, cf. [Butterfield, 1992]. In the second type of models, the\nstochastic models, the hidden variables determine the probabilities of measurement\noutcomes, not the outcomes themselves. Deterministic models are thus a special\ncase where all probabilities are either 0 or 1.\nNote that the only role of the hidden variables in both kinds of models is to either\nfix results or probabilities. The distinction between deterministic and stochastic has\nthus nothing to do with the issue of deterministic or indeterministic evolution of\nthe hidden variables. A deterministic hidden-variable theory could thus allow for\nindeterministic evolution of the systems in question, a point also made by Butterfield\n[1992].\n\n3.2.2\n\nDeterministic models\n\nA deterministic LHV model assumes that the outcomes of experiments are completely determined by the hidden variables and the settings of the apparata3:\n3 Bell [1964] was the first to consider such abstract deterministic models but only for perfect\n(anti-) correlations. The determinism was a consequence of the assumed perfect (anti-) correlation.\nUnder this restriction he derived his famous 1964 inequality. Clauser et al. [1969] relaxed this and\nwere able to derive a Bell-type inequality nevertheless. Bell [1971] generalized the result of Clauser\net al. [1969] by including apparatus hidden variables, thereby considering a contextual deterministic\nlocal hidden-variable model. It is interesting to note that, because of the assumption of perfect\n(anti-) correlation, Bell's original 1964 inequality is not a Bell-type inequality as we have defined\nit here in (2.17).\n\n\f52\n\nChapter 3\n\na = a(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb), b = b(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb). The expectation value E(AB) of\nthe product of the observables A and B is then determined by\nZ\nE(A, B) :=\na(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) b(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) d\u03bcA d\u03bcB d\u03bb,\nM\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere M is the total set of all hidden variables and the hidden-variable distribution\nis positive and normalized, i.e.,\nZ\n\u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) \u2265 0 and\n\u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) d\u03bcA d\u03bcB d\u03bb = 1.\n(3.7)\nM\n\nWe now invoke to the idea of locality and thus require that measurement results\nare not dependent on spacelike separated results, settings, or apparatus hidden\nvariables4 . This results in the assumption of Local Determination (LD):\n\u001a\na(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = a(A, \u03bcA , \u03bb),\nLD :\n\u2200 \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B.\n(3.8)\nb(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = b(B, \u03bcB , \u03bb),\nFurthermore, without introducing any restrictions, one can assume that for a\nrealistic theory (i.e., obeying the idea of realism) the set of hidden variables M is the\nCartesian product \u039b \u00d7 \u03a9A \u00d7 \u03a9B . Here \u039b is the set of possible values of the hidden\nvariables associated to the two subsystems to be measured and \u03a9A and \u03a9B is the\nset of hidden variables of the two apparata that measure A and B respectively. The\nCartesian product structure guarantees the compatibility of all the different hidden\nvariables, cf. [Clifton et al., 1991].\nWe will now use these locality conditions to obtain a non-trivial constraint.\nFirst, we average over the apparata hidden variables to get\nZ\na(A, \u03bcA , \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A)d\u03bcA ,\na(A, \u03bb) :=\n\u03a9A\nZ\nb(B, \u03bcB , \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B)d\u03bcB .\n(3.9)\nb(B, \u03bb) :=\n\u03a9B\n\nThese definitions together with the conjunction of LD and ISA now allow for rewriting (3.6) as\nZ\nE(A, B) =\na(A, \u03bb) b(B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb.\n(3.10)\n\u039b\n\nFinally, since |\u0101(A, \u03bb)|, |b\u0304(B, \u03bb)| \u2264 1 this correlation has the standard form that\nimplies CHSH inequality [Clauser et al., 1969; Bell, 1987]:\n|E(A, B) + E(A, B \u2032 ) + E(A\u2032 , B) \u2212 E(A\u2032 , B \u2032 )| \u2264 2.\n\n(3.11)\n\n4 No prescription is given for measurements where one of the apparata is switched off, but this\ncan be easily accounted for by letting the variables representing states and results range over 'null\nstates' and 'null results', cf. [Clifton, 1991].\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n53\n\nFor a proof see the Intermezzo below. Thus a deterministic theory that has free\nvariables and which obeys local realism has to obey this inequality5 . For a stochastic\nmodel the same holds, as will be shown in the next subsection\nIntermezzo: standard derivation of the CHSH inequality\nSuppose E(A, B) has the following form\nZ\nE(A, B) =\nX(A, \u03bb) Y (B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb,\n\n(3.12)\n\n\u039b\n\nwith |X(A, \u03bb)| \u2264 1 and |Y (B, \u03bb)| \u2264 1.

Note that we use the same hidden variable \u03bb for all four terms in the left hand side\nof (3.13). Above we have argued this to be a consequence of the realism assumption.\n\n3.2.3\n\nStochastic models\n\nWe now generalize the above to stochastic models where the hidden variables only\ndetermine the probabilities6 for outcomes of measurement. Such as model then provides the quantity P (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) which is the joint probability that the two\nmeasurement outcomes a, b are obtained for some specific settings A, B and hidden\nvariables \u03bcA , \u03bcB and \u03bb. These are called subsurface probabilities, to distinguish\nthem from the surface probabilities P (a, b|AB) which are empirically accessible.\n5 If LD of (3.8) is violated we can easily get the absolute maximum of 4 for the CHSH expression.\nConsider the expression a11 b11 + a12 b12 + a21 b21 \u2212 a22 b22 . One simply chooses a11 = a12 = a21 =\n\u2212a22 = 1 and b11 = b12 = b21 = b22 = 1. Here a11 is the outcome obtained by the first party if\nboth the first and second party choose setting 1, b12 the outcome obtained by the second party if\nthe first party chooses setting 1 and the second party setting 2, etc.\n6 It is not necessary to take a stance on what a probability is, or to commit oneself to an\ninterpretation of probability. We can be neutral as to whether probability is objective chance, a\nmeasure of partial belief, a propensity, etc.; it is sufficient to assume that it is measured by relative\nfrequencies. However, the idea that we are dealing with a realistic hidden-variables theory, where\nthe hidden variables are supposed to give a complete description of the state of affairs favors a\nreading of the probabilities as objective probabilities or chances.\n\n\f54\n\nChapter 3\n\nFor the expectation value E(A, B) a stochastic hidden-variable theory7 then\nyields\nZ X\nab P (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) d\u03bb d\u03bcA d\u03bcB , (3.14)\nE(A, B) =\nM a,b\n\nwhere we again assume M = \u039b \u00d7 \u03a9A \u00d7 \u03a9B .\nAgain, we invoke the idea of locality and thus require that measurement results\nare statistically independent of spacelike separated results, settings, or values of\napparatus hidden variables8 . Let us furthermore assume that the hidden variables\ncompletely determine the probabilities and that they can serve as common causes.\nThese assumptions then give9 the conditions called Outcome Factorisability (OF)\nand Outcome Locality (OL) (terminology from [Clifton et al., 1991]):\nOF : P (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb)P (b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb),\n\nOL :\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2200\u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B.\n\n(3.15)\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bcA , \u03bb)\n, \u2200\u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B.\nP (b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bcB , \u03bb)\n\n(3.16)\n\nThe probabilities P (a|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb), etc. in OF are defined as the marginals of\nthe joint probability P (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb), and similarly for the probabilities in\nOL.\nOL is the condition that the probabilities for outcomes only depends on the local\nsetting, the local apparatus hidden variable and the hidden variable that characterizes the subsystem that is locally measured. In particular it does not depend on the\nfaraway setting and apparatus hidden variable. OF is the condition that for given\nsettings and hidden variables the distribution for outcome a is independent from\nthe outcome b obtained at the other measurement station, and vice versa.\nNote that OF and OL are identical to Jarrett's conditions of 'Completeness' and\n'Locality' respectively [Jarrett, 1984]. See section 3.2.4 for a further discussion of\nJarrett's conditions.\n7 Clauser and Horne [1974] were the first to consider stochastic hidden-variable models in 1974.\nBell followed in 1976 [Bell, 1976] (However, see footnote 15 on page 56). But in a footnote in\n1971 Bell already mentioned that the CHSH inequality is expected to hold for stochastic hidden\nvariables as well [Bell, 1971, footnote 10] (cf. footnote 16 on page 58). However, Bell's main concern\nwas not with stochastic hidden variables but with apparatus hidden variables in a deterministic\ntheory which, when averaged over, would give a condition of average locality from which the CHSH\ninequality would follow. See Brown [1991, p. 145] for more on this point.\n8 Timpson and Brown [2002] argue that the assumption of locality in a stochastic hidden-variable\nframework is fundamentally different from the one in the deterministic framework of the previous\nsection, so that effectively two different notions of locality are in play. For our purposes such a\ndifference is not important.\n9 Whether these assumptions are indeed sufficient to imply OF and OL is a matter on which\nopinions may differ. As mentioned before, for our purposes this is not necessary. We could equally\nwell assume OL and OF right from the start. For a detailed motivation of the conditions using\nthe principle of common cause and the related idea of the idea of screening off, see Clifton et al.\n[1991] and Butterfield [1989].\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n55\n\nThe conjunction of OF and OL is called Total Factorisability (TF) and gives:\nTF : P (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (a|B, \u03bcA , \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bcB , \u03bb),\n\n\u2200\u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb, A, B.\n(3.17)\n\nThe conjunction of TF, and ISA allows for rewriting the product expectation value\n(3.14) as\nZ X\n(3.18)\nE(A, B) =\nab P (a|A, \u03bb) P (b|B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb) d\u03bb,\n\u039b a,b\n\nwhere P is a \u03bc-averaged probability, i.e.,\nZ\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B)d\u03bcA d\u03bcB ,\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) :=\n\u03a9A \u00d7\u03a9B\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb) :=\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9A \u00d7\u03a9B\n\n(3.19)\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B)d\u03bcA d\u03bcB , etc.\n\nUsing the definition E(A, \u03bb) :=\ntains the general form\n\n(3.20)\nP\n\nE(A, B) =\n\na\n\nZ\n\naP (a|A, \u03bb), and analogously for B, (3.18) ob-\n\nE(A, \u03bb)E(B, \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb,\n\n(3.21)\n\n\u039b\n\nfrom which the CHSH inequality follows in the standard way (see also the Intermezzo on p. 53). Thus a stochastic local realistic theory that has free variables10\nhas to obey the CHSH inequality.\nR\nThe surface probabilities are P (a, b|A, B) = \u039b d\u03bb\u03c1(\u03bb)P (a|A, \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bb) which\nwe defined to be local correlations in section 2.2.3, see (2.11). This implies that\nE(AB) in (3.18) is equal to hABilhv , as previously defined in (2.15).\n10 Models\n\nthat obey local realism (i.e., they obey TF) but that violate the freedom assumption\nIS of (3.1) are able to reach the absolute maximum of 4 for the CHSH expression. An example\nis the following model by Paterek [2007] where the hidden variable forces party II to choose a\nspecific setting depending on what outcomes b and b\u2032 (to be found upon measurement of either B\nor B \u2032 ) this hidden variable prescribes. The choice of the setting by party II consequently depends\non the outcomes to be obtained that are (probabilistically) determined by the hidden variables.\nThis constitutes a violation of IS.\nIn the model the possible results prescribed by \u03bb are (a, a\u2032 , b, b\u2032 ) = (1, 1, 1, 1) with probability\n1/2 and otherwise they are (a, a\u2032 , b, b\u2032 ) = (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1). If in a specific run it will be the case\nthat \u03bb prescribes that b = b\u2032 the model enforces that party 2 chooses setting B and otherwise\nB \u2032 is chosen. This scenario ensures that both (a + a\u2032 )b and (a \u2212 a\u2032 )b\u2032 are equal to 2 in any run\nof the experiment, thereby ensuring that the absolute maximum of 4 for the CHSH inequality is\nobtained.\nAnother such a model by Degorre et al. [2005] reproduces the singlet correlations of quantum\nmechanics as well as the corresponding marginals. Here the distribution of the hidden variables\nis explicitly dependent on the setting A: \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = |a * \u03bb|/2\u03c0 (the settings and hidden variable\nare chosen to be vectorial quantities a, b, \u03bb \u2208 R3 respectively). If the outcomes are determined\nby a(a, \u03bb) = \u2212sgn(a * \u03bb) and b(b, \u03bb) = sgn(b * \u03bb), then hABi = \u2212a * b and hAi = hBi = 0, which\nindeed are the singlet predictions.\n\n\f56\n\nChapter 3\n\nThis concludes the introduction of stochastic and deterministic local hiddenvariable models. Stochastic hidden-variable models are more general than deterministic hidden-variable models. Indeed, the later can be obtained from the first\nby setting all probabilities to be either 0 or 1. In such a case the condition of OF\nis automatically obeyed (for a proof see, amongst others, Jarrett [1984]) and the\ncondition of OL becomes LD, which is therefore also referred to as deterministic\nOL. Suppes and Zanotti [1976] showed that OF together with perfect correlation\n(i.e., hABi = +1) forces a stochastic hidden-variable model to be deterministic11 .\nThis result can be used to argue that genuinely stochastic local hidden-variables\ntheories are a red herring [Dickson, 1998, p.140] when it comes to reproducing\nquantum mechanics12 . However, the verdict on this issue is not important for our\ninvestigation, because we will later allow for the possibility that OF is violated and\nin such a case the Suppes-Zanotti results is no longer relevant. In the rest of this\nchapter we therefore unproblematically consider the more general case of stochastic\nhidden-variable theories.\n\n3.2.4\n\nJarrett vs. Shimony. Are apparatus hidden variables\nnecessary?\n\nIn reply to Jarrett [1984], who first distinguished OF and OL13 and showed them\nto imply TF, Shimony [1986] presented the conditions of Outcome Independence\n(OI) and Parameter Independence (PI) which are weaker forms of OF and OL that\ncan be considered as \u03bc- averaged versions of them14 :\nOI : P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, \u03bb)P (b|A, B, \u03bb),\n\n(3.22)\n\nPI : P (a|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) and P (b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.23)\n\nOI and PI give TF, which is the \u03bc-averaged version of TF:\nTF :\n\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|B, \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.24)\n\nIn what follows we will call TF Factorisability15 . Because Factorisability gives the\nstandard form of the correlation as in (3.18) Shimony's conditions together with IS\nalso imply the CHSH inequality.\n11 This result was anticipated by Bell in 1971 who remarked that perfect correlation requires\ndeterministic determination in a local hidden-variable theory [Bell, 1971].\n12 For the point of view that for the study of non-locality in quantum mechanics stochastic\nhidden-variable models are beneficial over and above deterministic hidden-variable models, despite\nthe Suppes-Zanotti result, see [Clifton et al., 1991; Brown, 1991; Butterfield, 1992].\n13 Jarrett [1984] called them 'completeness' and 'locality' and Ballentine and Jarrett [1987] called\nthem 'predictive completeness' and 'simple locality'.\n14 Shimony [1984] considered these conditions already in 1984 just after Jarrett proposed his\nconditions, but he did not call them Outcome Independence and Parameter Independence until\n1986. For early formulations of OI and PI see [van Fraassen, 1985] and [Suppes and Zanotti, 1976].\n15 Clauser and Horne [1974] also use Factorisability and call this Objective Locality (1974).\nThey seem to be aware that one needs both Shimony's conditions of OI and PI to get Factorisability, although they do not mention them explicitly. In 1976 Bell for the first time uses a fully\nprobabilistic setting where he considers stochastic hidden-variable theories [Bell, 1976]. He defines\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n57\n\nShimony [1984, p. 226, footnote] explicitly rejected the inclusion of apparatus\nhidden variables \u03bcA or \u03bcB . Clifton et al. [1991, p. 161] give a critical discussion of Shimony's arguments for this rejection. We will not discuss their criticism,\nbut discard of a simple objection one might raise against the claim that Simony's\nconditions are weaker than Jarrett's. The objection stems from the idea that simply including apparatus hidden variables in the hidden variable \u03bb would allow one\nto reproduce Jarrett's conditions from Shimony's. But there is a problem here.\nLet us take \u03bb\u2032 = (\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB ) and denote OI\u2032 , PI\u2032 as the conditions OI, PI where\n\u03bb is replaced by \u03bb\u2032 . One easily obtains that OI\u2032 is equivalent to OF and that\nOL implies PI\u2032 . But now OI\u2032 and PI\u2032 together are in fact more general than OF\nand OL, and it is the latter that are weaker, not the first. However, and this\nis the crucial point, the conjunction of PI\u2032 with OI\u2032 does not imply TF or any\nother similar factorisability condition where, given the hidden variables, one obtains the statistical independence between the two measurement stations. It gives\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb\u2032 ) = P (a|A, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb), which has an unwanted nonlocal dependency on the apparatus hidden variables.\nLet us take a closer look at Shimony's conditions before we discuss further how\nthey relate to Jarrett's conditions. PI is the condition that the probabilities for\noutcomes only depend on the local setting and the hidden variable \u03bb that charachis notion of Local Causality and claims this assumption to give the condition of Factorisability\nthat is subsequently used to derive the CHSH inequality. However, Bell's derivation is flawed:\nFactorisability does not follow from Bell's notion of Local Causality as it was give in his 1976\nmanuscript \u2013 to our knowledge this has not been commented on before.\nBell [1976] speaks of local beables A and B that are measured in regions 1 and 2 respectively.\nWe take these beables to be the possible outcomes of measurement (which are denoted by a, b in\nour notation). He furthermore introduces the symbol N to denote all beables in the intersection\nof the two backward lightcones of the two regions 1 and 2. This we denote by the hidden variable\n\u03bb. He next introduces the symbols \u039b and M to be the specification of some of the beables of the\nremainder of the backward light cone of 1 and 2 respectively. We denote this in our notation by\nA and B respectively, which we take to include the settings and any other relevant local beables.\nBell formulates Local Causality as the claim that (in our notation):\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) ,\n\n(Eq. (2) in [Bell, 1976]).\n\n(3.25)\n\nThis is actually requirement P1 of Maudlin (see section 3.2.5 for Maudlin's assumptions). He next\nconsiders the joint probability P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) which he rewrites using a standard rule of probability\ninto the equivalent form\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb)P (b|A, B, \u03bb) ,\n\n(Eq. (5) in [Bell, 1976]).\n\n(3.26)\n\nNext Bell invokes Local Causality and claims that Factorisability (i.e., P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) =\nP (a|A, \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bb)) follows. However, Bell's derivation is wrong because (3.25) does not suffice to obtain Factorisability from (3.26). One needs to assume at least one extra assumption.\nIndeed, assuming Maudlin's P2 would be sufficient.\nAlthough Bell's 1976 derivation to obtain Factorisability from Local Causality (in the form used\nby him in his derivation) needs a supplementary assumption to be successful, we believe that\nBell in fact believed that such a supplementary assumption was not necessary. At all other later\noccasions he uses a different technical formulation of Local Causality and uses a one step derivation\nto get Factorisability from Local Causality. Bell never used the distinctions of OI and PI (contra\nBrown [1991, p. 146] and Clifton [1991, p. 5]), see also footnote 41 on page 80.\n\n\f58\n\nChapter 3\n\nterizes the subsystem that is locally measured. In particular it does not depend on\nthe faraway setting. OI is the condition that for given settings and hidden variables\nthe distribution for outcome a is independent from the outcome b obtained at the\nother measurement station, and vice versa.\nA violation of PI entails that given the value of the hidden variable \u03bb the statistical distribution of A can be changed by changing the setting B of the distant\napparatus. If the hidden variables are under control this can be used to send a\nspacelike signal from I to II or vice versa. If, however, this control is absent, there\ncannot be any signaling, but the non-local setting dependence remains. A violation\nof OI entails that given the settings and the value of the hidden variable \u03bb the statistical distribution of outcome a changes if the outcome b of the distant apparatus\nwould be different.\nThe two sets of conditions (Jarrett's OF and OL and Shimony's OI and PI) are\noften conflated, however this is faulty. The first includes apparatus hidden variables, whereas the second does not. Jones and Clifton [1993, section 4] have shown\nthat this difference matters and that the two sets are fundamentally different: violations of OI can be compatible with OF. They also remark: \"Presumable we should\ntake the same precaution with regard to LOC [our notation: OL] and parameter\nindependence [PI]\" [Jones and Clifton, 1993, p. 310].\nAlthough we will later not explicitly use the apparatus hidden variables, we\nbelieve it is good practice to include them for the following three reasons.\n(i) Including apparatus hidden variables allows for more general hidden-variable\nmodels and we believe it is therefore to be preferred. Such an dependence on\nthe apparatus hidden variables can be easily removed: one simply averages\nover them.\n(ii) Considering apparatus hidden variables allows for two different physical motivations for a stochastic model [Butterfield, 1992]. The first motivation we\nhave already encountered: a complete specification of the hidden variables\ndetermines not outcomes of measurement but only probabilities for outcomes\nto be obtained. Such a model incorporates some irreducible indeterminism.\nThe second motivation arises when one considers averages over the apparatus hidden variables \u03bc, for example because the influence of the apparatus\nhidden variables cannot be accounted for precisely. Such average values can\nalso be interpreted, as Bell [1971] already noted16 , as the predictions of an\nindeterministic theory. When discussing Leggett-type models in section 3.3.4\nsuch an interpretation is explicitly spelled out. At the deeper level where one\nconsiders all hidden variables the model is deterministic but after averaging\nover apparatus hidden variables \u03bc the model can be described as a stochastic\n16 Bell [1971, footnote 10]: \"We speak here [when introducing apparatus hidden variables] as\nif the instruments responded in a deterministic way when all variables, hidden or nonhidden are\ngiven. Clearly (6) [i.e., (3.21) above] is appropriate also for indeterminism with a certain local\ncharacter.\"\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n59\n\nhidden-variable model prescribing only probabilities for outcomes of measurement.\n(iii) Including apparatus hidden variables incorporates the Bohrian point of view\nthat the total measurement context should be taken into account.\nIn the remainder of this chapter we will only consider averages over the apparatus\nhidden variables, i.e., \u03bc-averages. For notational simplicity we will therefore drop\nthe 'bar' over P to denote such \u03bc-averaged probabilities. We will also deal with the\n\u03bc-averaged version of ISA which is the assumption of IS. This encodes the notion\nof 'free variables' on the \u03bc-averaged level.\n\n3.2.5\n\nShimony vs. Maudlin: On the non-uniqueness of\nconditions that give Factorisability\n\nIn the previous section we have seen that in reply to Jarrett's analysis Shimony\nargued for conditions where the apparatus hidden variables are averaged over. He\nshowed that Factorisability is the conjunction of PI and OI. In reply to Shimony's\nanalysis, Maudlin [1994, p. 95] has argued that this conjunction is not unique. He\nclaims that Factorisability is logically equivalent to the conjunction of two other\nconditions which he called P1 and P2. These are:\nP1 :\n\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\n\nand P (b|B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\nP2 :\n\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, b, \u03bb)\n\n(3.27)\n\nand P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, a, \u03bb). (3.28)\n\nMaudlin gives no proof of his claim and Dickson [1998, p.224] mentions that the\nproof is not given by Maudlin, but that it \"proceeds along lines slightly different\nfrom the proof of Jarrett's result [. . . ]\". However, the proof appears to be not\nstraightforward at all, and since no proof was found in the literature we present one\nin the Appendix on page 86. This shows that P1 and P2 indeed imply Factorisability.\n3.2.5.1\n\nMaudlin's and Shimony's conditions in quantum mechanics\n\nQuantum mechanics can be considered as a stochastic hidden-variable theory. It\nthen obeys PI (also referred to as the 'quantum no-signaling theorem'), but violates\nOI. This proven in the Appendix on page 89.\nMaudlin [1994, p. 95] claims that his P1 is obeyed by quantum mechanics\nwhereas it is P2 that is violated. He furthermore remarks that \"One might very well\ncall P1 outcome independence and P2 parameter independence, since P1 concerns\nconditionalizing on the distant outcome and P2 on the distant setting\" [Maudlin,\n1994, p. 95]. Quantum mechanics is thus claimed to violate his parameter independence but to obey his outcome independence, which \u2013 and this is the crucial point\nfor Maudlin \u2013 is just the opposite from the analysis in terms of Shimony's concepts.\n\n\f60\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndeed, quantum mechanics violates Shimony's outcome independence but obeys\nhis parameter independence.\nBefore we assess the consequences of this claim for the project of understanding\nthe violation of Factorisability in quantum mechanics and of the CHSH inequality\nby experiment, an important point needs to be made. Maudlin gives no proof of his\nclaim, but merely states that \"orthodox quantum mechanics violates P2 but not P1\"\n[Maudlin, 1994, p. 95]. However, in order to evaluate the Maudlin distinctions in\nquantum mechanics one needs to make extra assumptions not needed for evaluating\nShimony's conditions. In the Appendix on page 89 this is explicitly shown. The\nextra assumption is that one needs to provide a probability distribution \u03c1(A, B)\nfor what settings A and B are to be chosen by the two parties. However, quantum\nmechanics does not prescribe anything about what observables are to be chosen. It\nmerely gives predictions for outcomes to be obtained given an experimental context\nwhere the settings are known.\n\n3.2.6\n\nOn experimental metaphysics\n\nLet us adopt the position that the experimentally confirmed violations of the CHSH\ninequality (modulo loopholes) imply that Factorisability must be violated because\nthe only other alternative, violation of IS, is rejected as it is too implausible. This\nposition is adopted by the majority of philosophers and physicists (although notorious exceptions exist) because they accept that the settings can be considered free\nvariables. Therefore, it was thought by many that in order to understand violations\nof the CHSH inequality one should understand failures of Factorisability. So when\nJarrett and Shimony presented their two conditions that together imply respectively TF and Factorisability, a lively debate started as to what violations of each\nof these two conditions entails. The focus has been on understanding violations of\nFactorisability rather than its counterpart TF that uses apparatus hidden variables.\nA common position in the literature is that failures of Factorisability should be\nunderstood as a failure of OI rather than PI. Otherwise, it is argued, the possibility\nof influencing the statistics of measurement outcomes on a system by manipulating a setting under our control on a distant system would, for a given \u03bb, allow\nsuperluminal signaling between spacelike separate events which conflicts with relativity. It is furthermore argued that no such signaling is possible from a violation\nof OI because the outcomes are only constrained stochastically and are not under\nour control. Thus violations of OI are supposedly consistent with relativity and\nno-signaling, whereas violations of PI are not, and it is furthermore believed that\ncorrelations that violate OI do not exhibit spacelike causation. Shimony [1984, p.\n226] referred to this position as one of 'peaceful coexistence' between quantum mechanics and relativity: action at a distance (violation of PI) is avoided but we must\naccept a sort of a new sort of non-causal connection called 'passion at a distance'\n(violation of OI) [Shimony, 1984, p. 227], cf. [Redhead, 1987]. Such an activity\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n61\n\nhas been called 'experimental metaphysics'17 . Others have suggested different interpretations of the alleged violation of OI that have resulted in equally startling\nmetaphysical conclusions18 .\nBut the view that it is OI that must be abandoned whereas it is PI that must be\nretained has been challenged by several authors. We will not discuss this issue very\nextensively. We merely review three arguments that exist in the literature against\nthis position and therefore against the specific form of experimental metaphysics\nthat takes this position as its starting point. Then in the next section two other\ndifficulties for advocating this position will be provided, which we briefly discuss\nhere already.\n(I) Maudlin [1994, p. 95] comments on the discussion about whether it is OI\nor PI that should be abandoned, that \"the entire analysis is somewhat arbitrary\"\nbecause of the non-uniqueness of carving up the condition of Factorisation. Why\nfocus on OI and PI rather than on P1 and P2? Furthermore, in a quantum context,\nwhere OI is violated and PI is obeyed, focusing on P1 and P2 shows a different\npicture: P2 is violated by quantum mechanics thereby indicating a form of setting\ndependence instead of outcome dependence. The 'passion at a distance' has become\n'action at a distance'. Because we have no reason to favor the distinction between\nOI and PI over the one between P1 and P2 the starting point for experimental\nmetaphysics is blocked.\nHowever, we note that this argument glosses over an important difference between the Shimony and Maudlin distinctions. We have just seen that Maudlin needs\nto make additional assumptions \u2013 not needed by Shimony \u2013 in order to evaluate\nhis conditions in quantum mechanics. The non-uniqueness is thus only on a formal\nlevel, when actually applied to quantum mechanics the Maudlin distinctions becomes unnatural because of the supplementary assumptions. Maudlin's argument\nthat in evaluating the condition of Factorisability in quantum mechanics one can\nequally well use his way of carving up this condition instead of Shimony's thus\nbreaks down.\nDespite the failure of Maudlin's argument, the argument against the importance\nof the Shimony way of carving up Factorisability can be somewhat saved by noting\nthat it has not been shown that Shimony's way is unique. OI and PI are sufficient\nto get Factorisability. But Maudlin's conditions suffice too, although, as we have\nshown above, they can arguably be dismissed as unnatural. In any case, we have no\n17 Jones and Clifton [1993, p. 296] characterize this activity as follows: \"First we demonstrate\nthat any empirically adequate model of the Bell-type correlations which does not contain any\nsuperluminal signaling will have a particular formal feature. [. . . ] Then we adduce an argument\nwhich purports to show that the formal feature in question is evidence of a certain metaphysical\nstate of affairs. It this works we have powerful argument from weak and general premises (namely,\nempirical adequacy and a ban on superluminal signaling) to a rich an momentum conclusion about\nthe structure of the world\".\n18 For example: the existence of holism of some stripe [Teller, 1986, 1989; Healey, 1991]; incompleteness as a property of nature [Ballentine and Jarrett, 1987, p. 700]; the necessity of\nbroadening the classical concept of a localized event [Shimony, 1989, p. 30]; adopting relative\nidentity for physical individuals [Howard, 1989, p. 250].\n\n\f62\n\nChapter 3\n\nnecessary and sufficient set of conditions, therefore we cannot say what a violation\nof Factorisability amounts to. This point will return in the next section, where we\nshow that they are not necessary for deriving the CHSH inequality.\n(II) The relationships between on the one hand OI and PI and on the other\nhand spacelike causation, signaling and relativity are much more subtle than is\nacknowledged in most of the experimental metaphysics projects19 .\n(a) First of all, PI may be violated without there being any signaling. It could\nbe that the hidden variables \u03bb may not be controllable, thereby blocking the\nroute to changing the faraway outcome using the local setting under control,\ncf. (III) below.\n(b) In the literature it is argued that relativity plays identical roles in justifying\ncompleteness and locality, but for both not a decisive role. For example, Butterfield [1992, p. 76] claims that \"[t]he prohibition of superluminal causation\nplays the same role in justifying completeness and locality''. In justifying\nboth conditions extra assumptions over and above relativity are needed, such\nas e.g., Reichenbach's common cause principle, cf. Maudlin [1994, especially\nchapter 4].\n(c) It is furthermore argued that peaceful coexistence with relativity does not favor\ngiving up OI instead of PI, i.e., violations of OI and PI are equally at odds\nwith a ban on superluminal signaling, and, furthermore, that there is nothing\nintrinsically non-causal about correlations that violate OI. Jones and Clifton\n[1993] make this point very convincingly for the conditions OF and OL that\ninclude the apparatus hidden variables \u03bc (recall that the \u03bc-averaged conditions\nof OF and OL are OI and PI respectively). They show that violation of OF\ncan be used to signal superluminally if the right conditions were satisfied.\nAnd the conditions that would have to be satisfied are just the same (mutatis\nmutandis) as the conditions that would have to be satisfied for us to be able\nto put violations of OL to use in signaling superluminally \u2013 roughly speaking,\nin both cases we need to assume that we would be able to control (or at least\ninfluence) the values of all the variables that appear in the relevant conditional\nprobabilities20 . So no important asymmetry has been established between OL\nand OF with regard to superluminal signaling. The same analysis holds for\n19 For\n\nan extensive discussion of these relationships, see [Clifton et al., 1991], [Maudlin, 1994],\n[Dickson, 1998], [Butterfield, 1992] and [Berkovitz, 1998a,b].\n20 A violation of OF implies indeterminism, i.e., probabilistic determination of the outcomes. But\nthis does not imply that one cannot signal superluminally: \"The possibility remains open that\nthe experimenter might use some controllable feature of the experimental situation as a \"trigger\"\nwhich operates stochastically on the outcomes at her own end of the experiment. The signaler\ncould then influence, without complete controlling, the result in the individual case, and could\nthus signal superluminally by employing an array of identically prepared experiments-just as in\nJarrett's own argument for the claim that a failure of OL for stochastic theories makes superluminal\nsignaling possible.\" [Jones and Clifton, 1993, p. 301].\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n63\n\nthe \u03bc-averaged conditions OI and PI. Indeed, Kronz [1990] proved that under\ncertain circumstances one can use violations of OI to signal superluminally.\nButterfield [1992, p. 77] is of the same opinion: 'To sum up: relativity's lack\nof superluminal causation does not favor giving up OI over giving up PI. It\nleaves the issue open.', cf. [Butterfield, 1989, pp. 131-135].21\n(III) The mere existence of Bohmian mechanics undermines the starting point\nof experimental metaphysics: violations of PI do not have to lead to signaling. This\ntheory violates PI, obeys OI, and is empirically equivalent to quantum mechanics\nand thus has no-signaling for the surface probabilities. Of course, there is a problem with reconciling Bohmian mechanics with relativity (Lorentz invariance of the\ndynamics is a problem), but this is a different point. The comparison should be\nmade to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, so Lorentz invariance is not the issue.\n(IV) In the next section we show that the CHSH inequality can be obeyed by\nhidden-variable models that violate the conditions OI, PI and IS. These models are\nsetting and outcome dependent in a specific way. This shows explicitly that none of\nthese three conditions are necessary for this inequality to obtain, i.e, they are only\nsufficient. Therefore, we have no reason to expect either one of them to hold solely\non the basis of the CHSH inequality. Of course, when confronted with experimental\nviolations of the CHSH inequality one must still give up on at least one of the\nconditions OI, PI or IS. However, the crucial point is that giving up only one might\nnot be sufficient. The CHSH inequality does not allow one to infer which of the\nconditions in fact holds. The results of the next section show that even satisfaction\nof the inequality is not sufficient for claiming that either one holds. It could be that\nall three conditions are violated in such a situation.\n(V) Another difficulty for the project of experimental metaphysics, which is related to what was remarked about Bohm's theory in (III) above, is that with respect\nto violations of the CHSH inequality it will be shown in subsection 3.3.4 that which\nconditions are obeyed and which are not depends on the level of consideration. The\nverdict whether it is OI or PI that is to blame in violations of the CHSH inequality may thus change depending on the level of consideration. A conclusive picture\ntherefore depends on which hidden-variable level is considered to be fundamental.\nBut since it is impossible to know whether one has obtained the fundamental level,\none cannot argue that it is OI that has to be abandoned when being confronted\nwith violations of the CHSH inequality. It might be that a deeper hidden variable\nlevel exists at which it is deterministic PI that is violated and not OI. This again\n21 Points\n\n(b) and (c) go against the idea that OI is solely a condition of completeness or sufficiency\nwhich has nothing to do with locality and superluminal causation. For example, Uffink (private\ncommunication) defends such a view: OI can be given an interpretation in terms of Bayesian\nstatistics where \u03bb and the settings are a sufficient statistic. We do not comment further on\nwhether locality and/or spacelike causation need to be invoked to argue for OI. What seems to\nmatter most is not what is sufficient for justifying OI but what violations of it amount to. The fact\nthat violations of OI can, under the right circumstances, lead to signaling is enough to block the\nstarting point of this form of experimental metaphysics, which is that violations of OI peacefully\ncoexist with relativity.\n\n\f64\n\nChapter 3\n\nundercuts the starting point of any form of experimental metaphysics that takes\nthe failure of OI to be responsible for violations of the CHSH inequality.\n\n3.3\n\nNon-local hidden-variable models obeying the\nCHSH inequality\n\nIn this section we will derive the CHSH inequality firstly, by relaxing the condition\nLD (in the deterministic case) or OI and PI (in the stochastic case), and secondly,\nwe will allow for specific hidden-variable distributions that violate IS (i.e., we will\nnot assume the hidden variables to be free variables). Although this weakens the\nassumptions of the previous section considerably, we nevertheless show that the\nderivation of the CHSH inequality, both for deterministic as well as for stochastic\nmodels, still goes through. This analysis generalizes investigations by Fahmi [2005]\nand Fahmi and Goldshani [2003, 2006].\nWe perform the analysis for \u03bc-averaged assumptions. No apparatus hidden\nvariables besides the settings are taken into account. The generalization to models\nthat include apparatus hidden variables gives no new interesting results, but can\neasily be done. Alternatively, we could think of the apparatus hidden variables to\nbe included in the settings for notational simplicity, cf. Butterfield [1992], but note\nthat this inclusion glosses over the differences between the two types of models (i.e.,\nwith or without apparatus hidden variables), as discussed in section 3.2.4, although\nthese differences do not matter here.\n\n3.3.1\n\nDeterministic case\n\nConsider the Gedankenexperiment of Figure 3.1. Recall from section 3.2.1 that\na deterministic local hidden-variables model which obeys the assumptions of LD\n(3.8) and ISA (3.5) must obey the CHSH inequality. However, we will now weaken\nthese two requirements and show that they are nevertheless sufficient in order to\nderive the CHSH inequality.\nLet us first weaken LD by explicitly allowing for non-locality. Assume a deeper\nhidden-variable level which is represented by hidden variables \u03c9 for system 1 and \u03bd\nfor system 2, with corresponding distribution functions k(\u03c9) and l(\u03bd). The outcomes\nof measurement a(A, B, \u03bb) and b(A, B, \u03bb) are now assumed to be determined by the\ndeeper level hidden variables in the following way [Fahmi, 2005]:\nZ\na(A, B, \u03bb) = f1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9) g1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9) k(\u03c9) d\u03c9,\n(3.29)\nZ\nb(A, B, \u03bb) = f2 (A, \u03bb, \u03bd) g2 (B, \u03bb, \u03bd) l(\u03bd) d\u03bd,\n(3.30)\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n65\n\nwith\n\u2212 1 \u2264 f1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9), g1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9), f2 (A, \u03bb, \u03bd), g2 (B, \u03bb, \u03bd) \u2264 1,\nZ\nZ\nk(\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\nl(\u03bd)d\u03bd = 1 , and k(\u03c9) \u2265 0, l(\u03bd) \u2265 0.\n\n(3.31)\n\nThe functions f and g represent response functions that encode the way the nonlocal hidden-variables theory determines the measurement outcomes. For example,\nin (3.29) the outcome experimenter 1 (who measures system 1) will obtain when A\non system 1 is being measured and B on system 2 (by experimenter 2) for a given\nhidden variable \u03bb is determined firstly by averaging over the deeper level hidden\nvariable \u03c9 and secondly by the local response function f1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9) and the non-local\nresponse function g1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9) (note that both response functions are for system 1).\nNote that for the special case of k(\u03c9) = \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 ) and l(\u03bd) = \u03b4(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) we get the\nnon-local relations of Fahmi and Goldshani [2003]): a(A, B, \u03bb) = f1 (A, \u03bb) g1 (B, \u03bb)\nand b(A, B, \u03bb) = f2 (A, \u03bb) g2 (B, \u03bb).\nThe non-local relations (3.29) and (3.30) lead to\nZ\nE(A, B) = a(A, B, \u03bb) b(A, B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb) d\u03bb\n(3.32)\nZ \u0010Z\nZ\n\u0011\n=\nf1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9) g1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9) k(\u03c9) d\u03c9 f2 (A, \u03bb, \u03bd) g2 (B, \u03bb, \u03bd) l(\u03bd) d\u03bd \u03c1(\u03bb) d\u03bb\nZ Z\n\u0010Z\n\u0011\n=\nl(\u03bd)k(\u03c9)d\u03c9d\u03bd\nf1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9) g1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9)f2 (A, \u03bb, \u03bd) g2 (B, \u03bb, \u03bd) \u03c1(\u03bb) d\u03bb .\nNow define:\nU (A, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd) := f1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9) f2 (A, \u03bb, \u03bd),\n\n(3.33)\n\nW (B, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd) := g1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9) g2 (B, \u03bb, \u03bd).\n\n(3.34)\n\nIt follows that |U (A, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd)| \u2264 1, and |W (B, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd)| \u2264 1. Let\nZ\nE(\u03c9,\u03bd) (A, B) := U (A, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd) W (B, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd) \u03c1(\u03bb) d\u03bb.\n\n(3.35)\n\nThis quantity is in the standard factorisable form, and thus a CHSH inequality\nholds for E\u03c9,\u03bd (A, B) (see the Intermezzo on p. 53).\nAfter averaging over \u03bc, \u03bd we finally obtain the expectation value E(A, B):\nZ Z\nE(A, B) =\nE(\u03c9,\u03bd) (A, B)l(\u03bd)k(\u03c9)d\u03c9d\u03bd.\n(3.36)\nThus E(A, B) is a (\u03c9, \u03bd)-average of E(\u03c9,\u03bd) (A, B), and therefore a CHSH inequality\nalso holds for E(A, B), since averaging cannot increase expectation values. Note\nthat one could have started out with only the deeper level hidden variables and thus\neliminate the hidden variable \u03bb. However, for ease of comparison to the standard\n\n\f66\n\nChapter 3\n\nCHSH inequality derivation this has not been performed.\nBefore providing a generalization of the above to the stochastic case, we show that\nwe can weaken the assumption IS which was part of the assumption ISA that we\npreviously used to derive the CHSH inequality. We thus no longer assume that we\ndeal with free variables, i.e., the freedom assumption that gives IS of (3.1) need not\nbe made: The distribution \u03c1(\u03bb) of the hidden variable \u03bb does not have to be obey\n\u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bb). Indeed, a normalized distribution of the form [Fahmi, 2005]\nZ\n \u0303\n\u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A, \u03b3)\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B,\n\u03b3)m(\u03b3)d\u03b3,\n(3.37)\nalso suffices to derive the CHSH inequality22 . Here \u03b3 is a deeper level hidden\n \u0303\nvariable with distribution m(\u03b3), and where 0 \u2264 \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A, \u03b3) \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B,\n\u03b3) \u2264 1\nR\nand m(\u03b3)d\u03b3 = 1. Note that if m(\u03b3) = \u03b4(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 ) we get for \u03c1(\u03bb):\n \u0303\n\u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A, \u03b30 )\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B,\n\u03b30 ).\n\n(3.38)\n\nThe distribution of the hidden variables of the system explicitly depends on the\nsettings of both measurement apparata23.\nThe proof that a setting dependent hidden-variable distribution of the form\n(3.37) suffices to obtain the CHSH inequality goes exactly analogously to the above\nproof that establishes that E(A, B) of (3.32) with \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bb) has to obey the\nCHSH inequality24 .\nNote that the non-local distribution (3.37) again has a form of 'factorisability'\nof the settings A, B (or product form with respect to dependency on A and B), just\nas in (3.29) and (3.30). It is this fact which is responsible for the derivation to go\nthrough. This realization tells us that the following form of extreme non-locality\nstill suffices to derive the CHSH inequality:\na(A, B, \u03bb) = a(B, \u03bb) and b(A, B, \u03bb) = b(A, \u03bb).\n\n(3.39)\n\nThe outcomes at one setup now depend not on the local parameter but only on the\nnon-local parameter (and the hidden variable \u03bb, of course). Since the expectation\nvalue E(A, B) obtains the following product form\nZ\nE(A, B) = a(B, \u03bb)b(A, \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb,\n(3.40)\n22 E(A, B)\n\nR\nof (3.32) is then defined as E(A, B) = a(A, B, \u03bb) b(A, B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) d\u03bb.\nwe have assumed that \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) is normalized. If this is not the case, the distribution\nR\nR\n \u0303\n \u0303\nmust have the following factorising form: \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A)\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)/\n\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A)d\u03bb \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)d\u03bb.\n24 More explicitly,\none inserts (3.37) in (3.32) in place of \u03c1(\u03bb) and redefines U\nand W to be U (A, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd, \u03b3) := f1 (A, \u03bb, \u03c9) f2 (A, \u03bb, \u03bd)\u03c1(\u03bb|A, \u03b3) and W (B, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd) :=\ng1 (B, \u03bb, \u03c9) g2 (B, \u03bb, \u03bd)\u03c1(\u03bb|B, \u03b3)\nrespectively.\nThe\nexpression\nE(\u03c9,\u03bd,\u03b3) (A, B)\n:=\nR\nU (A, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd, \u03b3) W (B, \u03bb, \u03c9, \u03bd, \u03b3) \u03c1(\u03bb)\nd\u03bb\nthen\nhas\nthe\nstandard\nform\nto\ngive\nthe\nCHSH\ninRRR\nequality, and therefore E(A, B) =\nE(\u03c9,\u03bd,\u03b3) (A, B)l(\u03bd)k(\u03c9)m(\u03b3)d\u03c9d\u03bdd\u03b3 does so as well.\n23 Here\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n67\n\nwith 'factorisation' of the settings A, B the derivation of the CHSH inequality goes\nthrough. The same holds true if we use the non-local hidden-variable distribution\nof (3.37) which does not obey IS.\nThus a hidden-variable theory in which the outcome of one measurement is allowed to depend on the setting of the measurement apparatus of the other particle\nas in (3.29) and (3.30) for all possible response functions f1 , f2 , g1 , g2 must still obey\nthe CHSH inequality. However, quantum mechanics violates this inequality. Thus\nneither a local nor a non-local hidden-variable theory of the form here considered\ncan reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics.\nSo surely it cannot be non-locality per se that is the cause of the violation of\nthe Bell inequalities. What can be the cause? Three candidates seem to remain:\none or more of the following assumptions do not in fact obtain:\n(i) The assumption of realism as used here, i.e., that outcomes of measurement\nare determined by hidden variables and deterministic (though perhaps even contextual) response functions.\n(ii) The form of 'factorisability' of (3.29) and (3.30), i.e. the assumption of a\nproduct of response functions f and g. Note that Bell's non-local hidden-variable\nmodel that reproduces quantum mechanical predictions of the singlet state [Bell,\n1964] can thus not be of the form of (3.29) and (3.30). Indeed, it is not25 .\n(iii) The weakened version of IS as given in (3.37) that has a specific dependence\non the settings in the hidden-variable distribution.\nWe will come back to the issue of what to make of the violation of the CHSH inequality in section 3.3.3 and in section 3.6. In the next subsection we will generalize\nthe previous results to the case of stochastic hidden-variable theories.\n\n3.3.2\n\nStochastic case\n\nAs a first remark, and as a warming-up exercise, note that the previous analysis using the extreme form of non-locality as in (3.39) indeed generalizes to the stochastic\nsetting. For if the probabilities obey\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|B, \u03bb) and P (b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|B, \u03bb),\n\n(3.41)\n\nthen the joint probability P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) has such a form of non-local 'factorisation',\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|B, \u03bb) P (b|A, \u03bb),\n\n(3.42)\n\nfrom which we get a CHSH inequality using the standard derivation. Thus parameter independence (understood as no dependence on the distant parameter) is not\nnecessary in order to derive the CHSH inequality for a stochastic hidden-variable\ntheory. However, one could argue that this example has a form of parameter independence, although not of the distant parameter but of the local parameter.\n25\n\nBell's model has E(a, b) =\nby: a * b = 1 \u2212 \u03c02 arccos(a\u2032 * b).\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nR\n\nsgn(a\u2032 *\u03bb) sgn(b*\u03bb) d\u03bb with setting a\u2032 non-locally determined\n\n\f68\n\nChapter 3\n\nLet us now continue with a less contrived approach. Consider a stochastic\nhidden-variable model for the Gedankenexperiment of Figure 3.1. We will derive\nthe CHSH inequality under specific violations of outcome independence (OI), of\nparameter independence (PI) and of Independence of the Source (IS). We allow\nthat the probability that a certain local outcome is obtained can be dependent on\nthe local setting, the hidden variable as well as on the distant setting and outcome\nin the following way:\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = f (a, A, \u03bb) x(b, B, \u03bb),\n\n(3.43a)\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb) = f (a, A, \u03bb) x(B, \u03bb),\n\n(3.43b)\n\nP (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = g(b, B, \u03bb) y(a, A, \u03bb),\n\n(3.43c)\n\nP (b|A, B, \u03bb) = g(b, B, \u03bb) y(A, \u03bb).\n\n(3.43d)\n\nHere the response functions f , f , g, g, x, x, y and y have their range in the interval\n[0, 1] and are possibly further restricted by normalization conditions. We have now\nexplicitly incorporated some non-local setting and outcome dependence, i.e., OI\nand PI are not assumed. Furthermore, the distribution of the hidden variables is\nallowed to depend on the settings, and thereby to violate IS, as in (3.38):\n \u0303\n\u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) = \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A)\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B).\n\n(3.44)\n\nThe identity P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bb) together with the assumptions (3.43) and (3.44) allows for rewriting the expectation value E(A, B) as\nfollows:\nZ X\nab P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) d\u03bb,\nE(A, B) :=\na,b\n\n=\n\nZ X\n\nab P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb|A, B) d\u03bb,\n\na,b\n\n=\n\nZ X\n\n \u0303\nd\u03bb,\nab f (a, A, \u03bb) x(b, B, \u03bb) g(b, B, \u03bb) y(A, \u03bb) \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A)\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)\n\na,b\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nZ X\nZ\n\nZ\n\nwith\nF (A, \u03bb) :=\n\na f (a, A, \u03bb) y(A, \u03bb)\n\na\n\nX\n\n \u0303\nd\u03bb,\nb x(b, B, \u03bb) g(b, B, \u03bb) \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A)\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)\n\nb\n\n \u0303\nF (A, \u03bb) G(B, \u03bb) \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A) \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)\nd\u03bb,\n \u0303\nd\u03bb,\nF (A, \u03bb) \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A) G(B, \u03bb) \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)\n{z\n}|\n{z\n}\n|\nA\n\nX\na\n\n(3.45)\n\nB\n\naf (a, A, \u03bb) y(A, \u03bb) , and G(B, \u03bb) :=\n\nX\n\nb g(b, B, \u03bb) x(b, B, \u03bb).\n\nb\n\n(3.46)\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n69\n\nThe expectation value E(A, B) in (3.45) thus has obtained a product form in\nterms of the settings A and B. Furthermore, since |F (A, \u03bb)| \u2264 1, |G(B, \u03bb)| \u2264 1,\nR\nR\n \u0303\n\u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|A)d\u03bb = 1, and \u03c1\u0303(\u03bb|B)d\u03bb\n= 1, it follows that E(A, B) has obtained the\nstandard form from which one derives the CHSH inequality. This proof is not symmetric with respect to a and b, but this is not important. Starting with the identity\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) P (a|A, B, \u03bb) gives the same result.\nOur weakest set of assumptions leading up to the CHSH inequality26 are thus:\n(i) the non-local dependence of the distribution of the hidden variable \u03bb on the\nsettings A, B as in (3.37), and\n(ii) the setting and outcome dependent determination of the conditional marginal\nprobabilities as displayed in (3.43).\nFinally, note that the extreme non-local dependence as in (3.41) can be written\nin the general form of (3.43). Indeed, choosing f (a, A, \u03bb) independent of a, A and\ng(b, B, \u03bb) independent of b, B will suffice.\n\n3.3.3\n\nRemarks\n\n(0) Assuming local realism and that observables are free variables is sufficient for\nderiving the CHSH inequality, but not necessary. Indeed, the above results show\nthat the assumptions OI, PI and IS can be relaxed considerably while still implying\nthe CHSH inequality. Violations of the CHSH inequality thus not only exclude\nmodels in which OI, PI and IS hold, but also some models in which none of these\nthree assumptions hold. Thus, a larger class of models than previously considered\nis ruled out by quantum theory, and modulo some loopholes also by experiment.\nNote that the assumptions that are used to give the CHSH inequality are not\ndirectly experimentally testable since they involve the hidden variable \u03bb, i.e., the\nassumptions are at the subsurface level. It is only the surface probabilities not the\nsubsurface probabilities that are determined via measurement of relative frequencies\nin experiment. Therefore, experiment cannot tell us which of the assumptions are\nviolated and which ones are not.\n(1) The crucial point that is responsible for the derivation of the CHSH inequality, is that after incorporating all assumptions and averaging over all deeper level\nhidden variables a form of factorisability in the expression for the product expectation value was obtained. When this expression has the form E(A, B) =\nR\nX(A, \u03bb) Y (B, \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb, with |X(A, \u03bb)| \u2264 1 and |Y (B, \u03bb)| \u2264 1 the CHSH in\u039b\nequality follows. And to get such a form it was not necessary to assume IS, or,\n26 As\n\nmentioned before, the analysis here is performed without explicitly mentioning apparatus\nhidden variables since this complicates the notation and it has (as far as we can see) no advantage\nto be included. It can be easily seen however that if one would include the apparatus hidden\nvariables the more general non-\u03bc-averaged conclusion would be obtained: The CHSH inequality\ncan be derived while weakening OL, OF and ISA in the appropriate way so as to allow explicit\nsetting and outcome dependence.\n\n\f70\n\nChapter 3\n\nin the case of stochastic local realistic models, the conditions of PI and OI whose\nconjunction gives Factorisability. Nor was it needed to assume the independence of\nthe local outcomes on the distant settings (i.e., a(A, B, \u03bb) = a(A, \u03bb), etc.) in the\ncase of deterministic local hidden-variable models.\n(2) From a mathematical point of view it is no surprise that the contrived dependence as in (3.39) and (3.41), where the outcomes depended solely upon the\nnon-local settings (and not on the local ones), imply the CHSH inequality. Compared to the standard assumptions, the settings A and B were merely interchanged,\nbut what was important about the condition, the factorisability or product form of\nthe expressions, was retained. This situation has striking similarity to Maudlin's\nassumptions, where after interchanging outcome a and setting A (analogous for b\nand B) in Jarrett's or Shimony's assumptions one could still obtain Factorisability\n(see section 3.2.5).\nBut are these possibilities merely mathematical and nothing else? Perhaps, since\nthe newly obtained conditions might not be easily given a physical motivation, but\ntheir mere possibility, even if only mathematical, shows that one should be careful\nin analyzing what the experimentally confirmed violation of the CHSH inequality\nmeans.\nThe above remark raises the question whether it is possible to derive the CHSH\ninequality by weakening Maudlin's assumptions P1 and P2 whose conjunction also\ngives Factorisability. We have tried but did not succeed in doing so. If it is indeed impossible to weaken P1 or P2 to get the CHSH inequality, then this would\nshow an interesting and novel difference between the Shimony-assumptions OI and\nPI and the Maudlin-assumptions P1 and P2. Such a difference could possibly be\nused to argue for a foundational difference between the Shimony factorisation or\nthe Maudlin factorisation.\n(3) Jones et al. [2005] have studied so-called 'inseparable hidden-variable models'\nfor three and more subsystems and have shown that such models have to obey generalized CHSH inequalities (so called Svetlichny inequalities, see chapter 8), which\nquantum mechanics violates. The inseparable models they have studied are nonlocal setting dependent models. For three or more systems they thus showed that\nquantum correlations are stronger than the correlations of some such models.\nWe have complemented this analysis to the case of two subsystems and showed\nthat, because quantum mechanics violates the CHSH inequality for bi-partite systems, quantum correlations are stronger than a large class of non-local correlations.\n(4) Non-local hidden-variable models have been constructed that reproduce some of\nthe quantum correlations that violate the CHSH inequality. These are thus necessarily not of the non-local setting and outcome dependent forms considered above.\nIndeed, they are not. For example, Bell's hidden-variable model [Bell, 1964]) is not\nof any of these forms. In fact, it is not even analytic, cf. footnote 25. But non-\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n71\n\nanalytic models exist that violate PI but nevertheless obey the CHSH inequality27 .\nThus non-analyticity of the non-locality is not sufficient to violate the CHSH inequality, but it is in many cases necessary [Socolovsky, 2003]. It is an open question\nwhat form of non-locality is necessary and sufficient to imply the CHSH inequality.\n\n3.3.4\n\nComparison to Leggett's non-local model\n\nIn the previous section we have derived the CHSH inequality while explicitly allowing for some non-local setting and parameter dependence that violated the assumptions PI, OI and IS. Leggett [2003] recently derived a different inequality than\nthe CHSH inequality while also allowing a form of non-locality. Both the CHSH\nand Leggett's inequality are violated by quantum mechanics, but satisfaction of\nLeggett's inequality allows for correlations that violate the CHSH inequality. It is\ntherefore interesting to compare the two different forms of non-locality involved.\nThis is the goal of this subsection.\nLeggett considers two parties, I and II respectively, that each hold a subsystem on which they measure different dichotomous observables which are indicated\nby the settings A and B and that have outcomes a = \u00b11, b = \u00b11 respectively.\nHe furthermore considers a deterministic hidden-variable model that is supposed\nto give the outcomes of measurement. The model assumes three hidden variables\n\u03bb, u, v. For these hidden variables he assumes that IS holds, i.e., their distribution is independent of the settings A, B: \u03c1(\u03bb, u, v|A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bb, u, v). The hidden\nvariable \u03bb specifies the total system and the vectors u and v are further specifications of the subsystems held by party I and II respectively. The outcomes a, b\nare deterministically determined by the settings A, B and the hidden variables, i.e.,\na = f (A, B, \u03bb, u, v) and b = g(A, B, \u03bb, u, v).\nSince the model is deterministic the assumption OI is automatically obeyed28 .\nHowever, in order to obtain a non-trivial result Leggett does not assume the locality\nassumption LD, i.e., he does not require that a = f (A, \u03bb, u) and b = g(B, \u03bb, v). He\nthus allows for a possible non-local setting dependence of the local outcomes, which\n27 An example of such a model is the following. Suppose the settings A and B are some vectorial\nquantities a and b respectively, just as \u03bb is. We now choose P (a|a, b, \u03bb) = 21 + a \u03b1 sgn(a* \u03bb) sgn(b*\n\u03bb), and P (b|a, b, \u03bb) = 12 + b \u03b2 sgn(b * \u03bb) sgn(a * \u03bb), where \u22121/2 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2264 1/2, and sgn(\u03c6) is equal\nto 1 if \u03c6 \u2265 0 and equal to \u22121 if \u03c6 < 0. Suppose OI and IS obtains, then one obtains that\nE(a, b) = 4\u03b1\u03b2. This model violates PI (e.g., P (a|a, b, \u03bb) 6= P (a|a, \u2212b, \u03bb) ) but obeys (3.43), and\ntherefore obeys the CHSH inequality.\n28 Leggett, remarks \". . . I shall rather arbitrarily assert assumption (4) (outcome independence).\nThe reason for doing so is not so much that it is particularly \"natural\" [. . . ] but it is a purely\npractical one.; if one relaxes (4) [i.e., OI] it appears quite unlikely (though I have no rigorous\nproof) that one can prove anything useful at all, and in particular it appears very likely that one\ncan reproduce quantum-mechanical results for an arbitrary experiment.\"[Leggett, 2003, p.1475].\nLeggett does not seem to realize that his starting point, a deterministic theory, automatically\nenforces OI to be obeyed. In order to allow for the possibility of a violation of OI he should\nconsider indeterministic hidden-variable theories from the start. However, as we will argue below,\nafter averaging over \u03bb, i.e., on the level u and v, OI is violated in Leggett's model.\n\n\f72\n\nChapter 3\n\nLeggett interprets as a violation of the assumption of PI29 .\nLeggett now introduces some further assumptions from which he derives his\ninequality. These assumptions are not at the level of the three hidden variables\n\u03bb, u, v, but at the level of the two hidden variables u, v where one has averaged\nover \u03bb using some distribution of the hidden variables \u03c1(\u03bb, u, v) that only has to\nobey normalization constraints. These assumptions (to be given below) are thus\nimposed on the following \u03bb-averaged quantities (where we follow the notation of\nBranciard et al. [2008]):\nZ\nI\nM\u03be (A, B) =\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03be) f (A, B, \u03bb, \u03be),\n(3.47a)\nZ\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03be) g(A, B, \u03bb, \u03be),\n(3.47b)\nM\u03beII (A, B) =\nZ\nC\u03be (A, B) =\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03be) f (A, B, \u03bb, \u03be) g(A, B, \u03bb, \u03be).\n(3.47c)\nThese are equations (2.9a), (2.9b) and (2.11) of Leggett respectively [Leggett, 2003,\np. 1477]. Here we have introduced the notation \u03be for the pair (u, v). For a given\nvalue of \u03be, M\u03beI (A, B) and M\u03beII (A, B) are the marginal expectation values for party I\nand II respectively, and C\u03be (A, B) is the product expectation value. The expectation\nR\nvalue of measuring A and B jointly is then given by hABi = d\u03be \u03c1\u0303(\u03be) C\u03be (A, B),\nR\nwith \u03c1\u0303(\u03be) = \u03c1(\u03bb, \u03be)d\u03bb.\nIntroduction of \u03bb is not necessary for the derivation of the Leggett-inequality\nbecause the physical assumptions Leggett uses (to be shown below) are imposed only\non the quantities in the left hand side of (3.47) and these depend only on the hidden\nvariable \u03be. However, including \u03bb gives the hidden-variable model a radically different\ncharacter. By including this extra hidden variable Leggett is able to propose a\ndeterministic hidden-variable model. But the average values over \u03bb in (3.47) can\nalso be interpreted as the predictions of a stochastic hidden-variable model (see\nsection 3.2.4 were this has been also discussed). Below we will choose this option and\ninterpret these average values as predictions of an indeterministic model. This model\ngives the subsurface probabilities P (a, b|A, B, \u03be), i.e., the probabilities to obtain\nthe outcomes a, b when measuring A, B on a system in state \u03be. Accordingly, the\nquantities in (3.47) can be assumed to be determined by the subsurface correlations\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03be) in the following way:\nX\nM\u03beI (A, B) =\na P (a, b|A, B, \u03be),\n(3.48a)\na,b\n\nM\u03beII (A, B)\n\n=\n\nX\n\nb P (a, b|A, B, \u03be),\n\n(3.48b)\n\nab P (a, b|A, B, \u03be).\n\n(3.48c)\n\na,b\n\nC\u03be (A, B) =\n\nX\na,b\n\n29 Using our definitions this is a violation of LD. But it is of course possible to view this as\na violation of PI for the deterministic case where all probabilities are 0 and 1. We call such a\nsituation deterministic PI.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n73\n\nNote that in general the subsurface probabilities can be written as:\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03be) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n1 + a M\u03beI (A, B) + b M\u03beII (A, B) + ab C\u03be (A, B) .\n4\n\n(3.49)\n\nBecause the probabilities on the left hand side are non-negative the marginals\nM\u03beI (A, B) and M\u03beII (A, B) are not completely independent of the product expectation value C\u03be (A, B), and vice versa.\nBefore we discuss Leggett's assumptions that allow him to derive his inequality,\nwe first determine what the assumptions of OI and PI imply for the quantities in\n(3.48) and (3.49). For a given \u03be, PI requires the marginal expectation value for\nparty I (II) to be independent of the setting chosen by II (I)30 , i.e., M\u03beI (A, B) =\nM\u03beI (A), and M\u03beII (A, B) = M\u03beII (B), whereas OI requires that C\u03be (A, B) must have\nthe product form C\u03be (A, B) = M\u03beI (A)M\u03beII (B)31 . Inserting this into (3.49) gives:\nOI\nPI\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1 + a M\u03beI (A, B) 1 + b M\u03beII (A, B)\n4\n\u0001\n1\n=\u21d2 P (a, b|A, B, \u03be) = 1 + a M\u03beI (A) + b M\u03beII (B) + ab C\u03be (A, B)\n4\n\n=\u21d2 P (a, b|A, B, \u03be) =\n\n(3.52)\n(3.53)\n\nLeggett's model has a particular non-trivial form of the local marginal expectation values M\u03beI (A, B) and M\u03beII (A, B) that enforces PI so as to give (3.53), but\nputs no explicit constraints on C\u03be (A, B). The latter is only constrained by the fact\nthat P (a, b|A, B, \u03be) must be give a valid probability distribution over the outcomes\na, b for all choices of A, B [cf. Paterek, 2007]. It is thus explicitly not required that\nC\u03be (A, B) = M\u03beI (A)M\u03beII (B) which is equivalent to OI. Because Leggett allows PI\nto be violated, he does not want to require this condition OI, for he would then in\nfact require Factorisability (because PI is already assumed) from which one triv30 The presentation of Branciard et al. [2008] also discusses Leggett-type models at the \u03be-level.\nThey formulate this condition as a no-signaling condition at the level of the hidden variables \u03be.\nWe call this PI and reserve the notion of no-signaling to the surface probabilities P (a, b|A, B) only.\n31 That PI implies that M I (A, B) must be independent of B can be easily seen:\n\u03be\nX\nX\nI\na P (a|A, B, \u03be)\na P (a, b|A, B, \u03be) =\nM\u03be (A, B) =\na\n\na,b\nPI\n\n=\n\nX\n\na P (a|A, B \u2032 , \u03be) =\n\na\n\nX\n\na P (a, b|A, B \u2032 , \u03be) = M\u03beI (A, B \u2032 ),\n\na,b\n\n(3.50)\nand analogous for M\u03beII (A, B)\nC\u03be (A, B) = M\u03beI (A)M\u03beII (B):\nC\u03be (A, B) =\n\nX\n\nindependent of A.

We conclude that Leggett allows for violations\nof OI33 . It is interesting to contrast this with what happens on the deterministic\n(\u03bb, u, v)-level described above, and which Leggett originally considered. On this\nlevel Leggett's model obeys OI, but allows for violations of deterministic PI. This\ndifference will be further discussed below. But we first present Leggett's further\nassumptions explicitly.\nLeggett's fundamental assumption is that locally the systems party I and II\npossess behave as if they were in a pure qubit quantum state, i.e., each local system\nwhen analyzed individually is in a pure quantum state. This is encoded in the\nformalism presented above in the following way: \u03be describes the hypothetical pure\nstates of the qubits held by parties I and II, and these are denoted by normalized\nvectors u, v on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, so as to give: \u03be = | ui \u2297 | vi. As a consequence\nof Leggett's assumption the local marginal expectation values are the ones predicted\nby quantum mechanics:\nI\nMu,v\n(a) = h u|a * \u03c3| ui = u * a,\n\nII\nMu,v\n(b) = h v|b * \u03c3| vi = v * b.\n\n(3.54)\n\nHere the measurement settings are represented as unit-vectors on the Poincar\u00e9\nsphere: A \u2192 a, B \u2192 b. In Leggett's model the qubits are encoded in polarization degrees of freedom of photons. Each photon is assumed to have a definite\npolarization in directions u and v respectively and the local marginal expectation\nvalues should obey Malus' law.\nIf we now consider the correlations (3.49), where \u03be = | ui \u2297 | vi and \u03c1(\u03be) some\ndistribution of the polarizations u, v, we see that Leggett's model requires that\nP (a, b|a, b, u, v) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n1 + a u * a + b v * b + ab Cu,v (a, b) .\n4\n\n(3.55)\n\nThis explicitly incorporates Leggett's assumption that the local marginal expectation values should obey (3.54). Leggett showed that this constraint leads to an\ninequality which is violated by the singlet state correlations of quantum mechanics. Because Leggett's original inequality was not amenable to experimental testing\nother Leggett-type inequalities have been derived which are violated in recent experiments (see e.g. [Branciard et al., 2008] and references therein).\n32 \"It is immediately clear that a necessary (but by no means sufficient) condition for a [Leggetttype model] to be nontrivial is that the subensemble averages fail to satisfy AB = A * B [in our\nnotation: C\u03be (A, B) = M\u03beI (A)M\u03beII (B)].\"[Leggett, 2003, p. 1485]\n33 Branciard et al. [2008, p. 1.] formulate this as: \". . . , only the correlation coefficient [. . . ]\nC\u03be (A, B) can be non-local, . . . \" This we believe to be a confusing way of putting things. Furthermore, they remark, that \"Leggett's assumption concerns only the local part of the probability\ndistributions P\u03be ; it is thus somewhat confusing to name it [Leggett's model] a nonlocal model,\nthough it is clearly nonlocal in the sense of not satisfying Bell's locality assumption\" [Branciard\net al., 2008, p. 2.]. However, this statement itself is a bit confusing. We can state things more\nclearly: at the \u03be-level Leggett's model obeys PI, has specific constraints on the local marginal\nexpectation values for a given \u03be [to be specified below in (3.54)], but allows for violations of OI.\nTherefore, being the conjunction of OI and PI, Factorisability need not hold.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n75\n\nLet us present the strongest known Leggett-type inequality of Branciard et al.\n[2008]. This inequality uses three triplets of settings (ai , bi , b\u2032i ) where party 1 thus\nchooses 3 settings and party 2 chooses 6 settings. Party 2 chooses the same angle \u03c6\nbetween all pairs (bi , b\u2032i ) and such that bi \u2212 b\u2032i = 2 sin \u03c62 ei , where {e1 , e2 , e3 } form\nan orthogonal basis. The Leggett-type inequality of Branciard et al. [2008] reads\n3\n\n\u03c6\n2\n1X\n|hai bi i + hai b\u2032i i| \u2264 2 \u2212 | sin |,\n3 i=1\n3\n2\n\n(3.56)\n\nR\nP\nwhere hai bi i = du dv \u03c1(u, v) ab ab P (a, b|ai , bi , u, v). The singlet state gives a\nvalue of 2| cos \u03c62 | which violates this inequality for a large range of values of \u03c6.\nDiscussion34\nThe above exposition of Leggett's model has presented us with an interesting relationship between the way different assumptions at the two different hidden-variable\nlevels are related. At the (u, v)-level Leggett's model obeys PI, but allows for violations of OI. But this was shown to be a consequence of opposite behavior on the\ndeeper deterministic (\u03bb, u, v)-level: on this level OI is obeyed, but deterministic\nPI is allowed to be violated. We thus see that which conditions are obeyed and\nwhich are not depends on the level of consideration. A conclusive picture therefore\ndepends on which hidden-variable level is considered to be fundamental.\nThis can be nicely illustrated in a different hidden-variable model. Consider\nBohmian mechanics where the deeper hidden-variable level is the description that\ncontains the positions of the particles involved as well as the quantum state of these\nparticles35 . At this level Bohmian mechanics is deterministic and thus obeys OI,\nwhereas it is well known that deterministic PI (and IS) is violated [Dewdney et al.,\n1987]. However, at the level of the quantum state that is obtained by averaging\nover the positions of the particles we retrieve the quantum mechanical situation, as\ndiscussed in section 3.2.5, where OI is violated, but PI is obeyed.\nThis shows explicitly that parameter dependence at the deeper deterministic\nhidden-variable level does not always show up as parameter dependence at the\nhigher hidden-variable level, but sometimes as outcome dependence, i.e., as a violation of OI. In other words, violation of OI could be a sign of a violation of\ndeterministic PI at a deeper hidden-variable level.\nIt is known that any stochastic hidden-variable model can be made deterministic\nby adding additional variables. Here we should note that mathematically this always\nworks36 , but only if physically one assumes that the stochastic model is incomplete\n34 A\n\nmore profound discussion as well as a deeper analysis can be found in [Seevinck, 2008b].\nand Hiley [1993, p. 120] take as the hidden variables of Bohmian mechanics \"the overall\nwave function together with the coordinates of the particles\".\n36 Mathematically introduce a deeper level hidden variable \u03b6 with a distribution \u03c1(\u03b6) and a deterR\nministic response function \u03c7A,B (a, b, (\u03bb, \u03b6)) such that P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = \u03c7A,B (a, b, (\u03bb, \u03b6))\u03c1(\u03b6)d\u03b6.\nThis is always possible, for example choose \u03b6 uniformly distributed and set \u03c7A,B (a, b, (\u03bb, \u03b6)) = 1\nif \u03b6 \u2264 P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) and \u03c7A,B (a, b, (\u03bb, \u03b6)) = 0 otherwise (Cf. Werner and Wolf [2003] and Jones\n35 Bohm\n\n\f76\n\nChapter 3\n\nsince a deeper hidden-variable description is assumed to exist. In such a case the\nfeature above is generic: a violation of OI implies a violation of deterministic PI at\nthe deeper hidden-variable level where the model is deterministic. The reason being\nthat determinism implies OI (see next section) thus any violation of Factorisability\nmust be because of violation of PI at this deeper level.\nComparison\nWe will compare the Leggett-type model to the models of the previous section.\nThese latter were shown to violate OI, PI and IS in a specific way but to nevertheless\nobey the CHSH inequality. Because we have considered stochastic models such a\ncomparison must be performed at the at the (u, v)-level, and not at the deterministic\n(\u03bb, u, v)-level. We again write \u03be for the pair (u, v). Let us recall both sets of\nassumptions involved.\n(i) Models of section 3.3.2: We allow P (a, b|A, B, \u03be) to be of the form (3.43).\nThis violates both OI an PI. We furthermore allow the distribution of \u03be to\ndepend on the settings A, B as in (3.37), thereby violating IS.\n(ii) Leggett-type models: Both at the (\u03bb, \u03be)-level and at the \u03be-level IS must\nbe obeyed37 (assumption 2 of Leggett [2003, p. 1473]), i.e., both hiddenvariable distributions \u03c1(\u03bb|\u03be) and \u03c1(\u03be) must be independent of A, B. At the\n\u03be-level Leggett-type models obey PI and furthermore require the marginal\nexpectation values for a given value of \u03be to be equal to Malus' law at this\nlevel. OI is not assumed and possible violations of it are only constrained by\nconsistency requirements, not by any other restrictions.\nComparing these assumptions reveals the following. At the \u03be-level where the physical assumptions are made Leggett-type models obey PI and IS and therefore also our\nweakened version of PI and IS, but they must allow for violations of our weakened\nversion of OI. The latter must be the case because the Leggett-type assumptions\ntaken together are mathematically weaker than ours since a Leggett-type model has\nbeen given that violates the CHSH inequality [Paterek, 2007]. We conclude that\nalthough Leggett-type models impose a lot of structure (i.e., locally Malus' law\nneeds to be obeyed at the \u03be-level) the fact that violations of OI are not physically\nconstrained in any way gives Leggett-type models greater correlative power than\nour models that allow for restricted violations of PI, OI as well as IS.\net al. [2005]).\n37 With respect to possible violations of IS Leggett remarks: \"It might, for example, be thought\nat least plausible a priori to reject the second postulate [IS], and in particular to allow the hiddenvariable distribution \u03c1(\u03bb) to depend on the settings a and b of the polarizers. Whether any nontrivial results could be obtained under this assumption is a question I have not so far investigated\".\n[Leggett, 2003, p. 1492]. But we have investigated this, and have found a non-trivial result.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n3.4\n\n77\n\nSubsurface vs. surface probabilities:\ndeterminism and randomness\n\nThe previous section considered only subsurface probabilities and relationships between different kinds of assumptions at different hidden-variable (i.e. subsurface)\nlevels. In this section we investigate relationships between surface and subsurface\nprobabilities and various constraints that can be imposed on both types of probabilities.\nLet us first consider subsurface probabilities. These are conditioned on the hidden variable \u03bb, which we take to be completely specified38 . Suppose the hidden\nvariables are deterministic. This implies that OI is always obeyed, because if the\noutcomes are determined completely by the settings and the hidden variable, additionally specifying the outcome that was obtained by some distant party, cannot\nchange any probabilities (for a formal proof see, amongst others, Jarrett [1984]).\nThus, if OI is violated there must be some randomness at the hidden-variable level.\nLet us consider what this implies for a situation where Factorisability is violated (i.e., P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) 6= P (a|A, \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bb)) so as to give non-local correlations\nthat violate the CHSH inequality. Recalling that Factorisability follows from the\nconjunction of both OI and PI we obtain the following inferences:\n(i) Deterministic hidden variables and violation of Factorisability implies violation\nof PI.\n(ii) PI and violation of Factorisability implies randomness at the hidden-variable\nlevel.\nThus (i) says that any theory that gives violation of Factorisability but that\nobeys PI must have non-deterministic determination of the outcomes. Quantum\nmechanics, where one takes the quantum state to be the hidden variable, is an\nexample of such a theory: it obeys PI and the outcomes of measurement are probabilistically determined by the quantum state. However, not all hidden-variable\ntheories that violate Factorisability have this feature. Indeed, as (ii) says, one can\nallow for a deterministic substratum at the hidden-variable level, but at the price\nof violating PI. Bohmian mechanics is an example of such a latter theory. But we\nknow that it reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics and therefore obeys\nno-signaling for the surface probabilities it predicts. Such a no-signaling requirement is quite constraining. To see this we must look for analogs for the case of\nsurface probabilities of the inferences (i) and (ii) stated above.\nThere is no straightforward surface analog of (i), since violations of PI not\nnecessarily imply parameter dependence at the surface level (which would imply a\n38 In case the hidden variables are not completely specified (i.e., extra relevant information exists)\nthe trivial inference follows that outcomes will be probabilistically determined, i.e., deterministic\ndetermination is excluded from the start. We are interested in non-trivial inferences and therefore\nassume that the hidden variables are completely specified.\n\n\f78\n\nChapter 3\n\nviolation of the no-signaling constraint), because the hidden variables need not be\nunder control of the experimenter. However, (ii) does have a surface analog: Nosignaling correlations that are non-local, but which are given by a hidden-variable\nmodel that obeys PI must be indeterministic, i.e., it must show randomness in\ndetermining the outcomes. However, this does not apply to Bohmian mechanics\nsince it violates PI, so it would be interesting to see if such an inference can be\nmade for any no-signaling correlation, independent of whether they violate PI or\nnot. Surprisingly, this is indeed the case as was recently shown by Masanes et al.\n[2006] using the following proof.\nConsider a deterministic surface probability distribution Pdet (a, b|AB). The\noutcomes a and b are deterministic functions of A and B: a = a[A, B] and b =\nb[A, B]. Suppose it is a no-signaling distribution, then\nPdet (a, b|AB) =\u03b4(a,b),(a[(A,B],b[A,B]) = \u03b4a,a[A,B] \u03b4b,b[A,B]\n= P (a|A, B)P (b|A, B) = P (a|A)P (b|B).\n\n(3.57)\n\nThe right hand side is a local distribution (i.e., it is of the form (2.11)) and therefore\nany deterministic no-signaling correlation must be local. This results implies the\nfollowing inferences for the correlations that are defined in terms of the surface\nprobabilities:\n(iii) Any non-local correlation that is deterministic must be signaling.\n(iv) Any non-local correlation that is no-signaling must be indeterministic, i.e., it\ndetermines the outcomes only probabilistically.\nThe inference (iii) and (iv) are the surface analogs of (i) and (ii).\nIf we now again consider Bohmian mechanics, we see that because it obeys\nno-signaling and gives rise to non-local correlations (since it violates the CHSH\ninequality) it must determine the outcomes only probabilistically. So although this\ntheory has deterministic hidden variables, this determinism must stay beneath the\nsurface: the hidden variables cannot be perfectly controllable because the outcomes\nmust show randomness at the surface. In other words, although fundamentally\ndeterministic it must necessarily be predictively indeterministic. Thus no Bohmian\ndemon can have perfect control over the hidden variables and still be non-local\nand no-signaling at the surface. This is not specific to Bohmian mechanics: any\ndeterministic hidden-variable theory that obeys no-signaling and gives non-local\ncorrelations at the surface must have the same feature: it must determine the\noutcomes of measurement indeterministically.\nThe inferences (iii) and (iv) show that requiring no-signaling in conjunction\nwith some other constraint has strong consequences. But what if we solely require\nno-signaling? In the next section we derive non-trivial constraints using only this\ncondition and that are solely in terms of expectation values.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n3.5\n\n79\n\nDiscerning no-signaling correlations\n\nIn this section we search for non-trivial constraints on the expectation values that\nare a consequence of no-signaling. We derive a non-trivial Bell-type inequality for\nthe no-signaling correlations in terms of both product and marginal expectation\nvalues. It thus discerns such correlations from more general correlations. Although\nthe inequalities do not indicate facets of the no-signaling polytope we show that\nthey can provide interesting results nevertheless. They provide constraints on nosignaling correlations that are required to reproduce the perfectly correlated and\nanti-correlated quantum predictions of the singlet state.\nBefore we present our new inequalities, we first take a look at a previous attempt\nto formulate such a non-trivial inequality which we show to be flawed.\n\n3.5.1\n\nThe Roy-Singh no-signaling Bell-type inequality is\ntrivially true\n\nRoy and Singh [1989] claimed to have obtained a non-trivial no-signaling Bell-type\ninequality in terms of expectation values. They assumed no-signaling by requiring\nthat the expectation value of the observable corresponding to setting A only depends\non this setting and not on the faraway setting B, and vice versa. Thus hAins = f (A)\nand hBins = g(B) where f and g are some functions39 . The inequalities of Roy and\nSingh [Roy and Singh, 1989] read:\n| hABins \u00b1 hAins | \u2264 1 \u00b1 hBins ,\n\n| hABins \u00b1 hBins | \u2264 1 \u00b1 hAins .\n\n(3.58)\n(3.59)\n\nRoy and Singh interpret their inequalities as testing theories that obey no-signaling\nagainst more general signaling theories, i.e., their inequalities are supposed to give\na non-trivial bound for no-signaling correlations.\nWe mention two points of criticism; the first minor, the second major: First,\none should include the far-away setting in the marginals expectation values (i.e., use\nA\nhAiB\nns and hBins ) as was argued in footnote 16 on page 30. Secondly, no correlation\nwhatsoever can violate these inequalities, whether they are signaling or not. The\ninequalities are trivially true and are therefore irrelevant. The reason for this is\nthat they follow from the trivial constraint that the probabilities P (a, b|A, B) are\nnon-negative. Let us show why this is the case.\nThe Roy-Singh inequalities (3.58) and (3.59) are in fact equivalent to the set of\ninequalities\n\u22121 + |hAiB + hBiA | \u2264 hABi \u2264 1 \u2212 |hAiB \u2212 hBiA |\n\n(3.60)\n\n39 This notation by Roy and Singh is awkward since it suggests that the expectation value\nsolely depends on the setting and not also on the state of the system\nR one is measuring. However,\nthis is not the case since they in fact use the definition hAins := d\u03bb\u03c1(\u03bb, A, B)a(\u03bb, A, B), that\nincorporates the hidden-variable distribution of the system under consideration, and where the\ndependence on B on the left hand side is left out because of no-signaling.\n\n\f80\n\nChapter 3\n\nthat can be easily shown to hold for any possible correlation. Note that we leave\nout the subscript 'ns', but include in the marginal expectation values hAiB , hBiA\nthe setting at the other side because there might be a dependency on the far-away\nsetting as we are no longer restricting ourselves to no-signaling correlations.\nThe inequality (3.60) was first derived by Leggett [2003] in the following way (cf.\n[Paterek, 2007; Branciard et al., 2008]). For quantities A, B that can take outcomes\na = \u00b11 and b = \u00b11 the following identity holds:\n\u22121 + |a + b| = ab = 1 \u2212 |a \u2212 b|.\n\n(3.61)\n\nLet the outcome a be determined40 by some hidden variable \u03bb and by the settings\nR\nA, B: a := a(\u03bb, A, B). Furthermore, let hAiB := \u039b d\u03bb\u03bc(\u03bb|A, B)a(\u03bb, A, B) be the\naverage of quantity A with respect to some positive normalized weight function\n\u03bc(\u03bb|A, B) over the hidden variables. This function can contain any non-local or\nsignaling dependencies on the setting A and B. Define similarly the quantity hBiA\nand the average of the product AB denoted by hABi. Taking the average of the\nexpression in (3.61) and using the fact that the average of the modulus is greater\nor equal to the modulus of the averages one obtains the set of inequalities (3.60).\nAlthough the Roy-Singh inequalities indicate that the marginals hAiB and hBiA\nare not independent of the product expectation value hABi, and vice versa, this is\nonly a consequence of non-negativity of joint probabilities and not of the requirement\nof no-signaling. In conclusion, the Roy-Singh inequalities fail to show what they\nwere supposed to do41 . However, we next present a derivation that does meet this\ntask of providing a non-trivial no-signaling Bell-type inequality in terms of both\nproduct and marginal expectation values.\n40 Without any further constraints, it is mathematically always possible to let the outcomes be\ndetermined by a deterministic hidden variable model. This was explicitly shown in footnote 36 on\npage 75.\n41 Roy and Singh remark that J.S. Bell gave their manuscript a critical reading and that he\ncommented upon some aspects of their manuscript. But apparently Bell did not comment on the\nfact that the inequalities are trivially true. What is interesting though is that Roy and Singh\nmention that Bell informed them of the manuscript by Ballentine and Jarrett [1987] in which the\ndistinction between OL and OF is made (there called weak locality and predictive completeness)\nwhose conjunction gives the condition of Factorisability used in deriving the Bell theorem. This is\nthe only reference we know that indicates that Bell was aware of this distinction by Jarrett. We\ntherefore cannot agree with Brown [1991, p. 146] that Bell [1981] was aware of any such distinction\nby 1981. On all occasions where Bell argues for Factorisability [i.e., in [Bell, 1976, 1977, 1980,\n1981, 1990]] this is performed using only a single step that is motivated by his condition of Local\nCausality. For Bell Factorisability is a package deal. Indeed, he nowhere uses a two step derivation\nthat makes use of the conditions of OL and OF or some variants such as Shimony's PI and OI.\n(However, see footnote 15 for the awkward derivation Bell uses to obtain Factorisability in his\n[Bell, 1976].) It seems that Bell regarded local outcomes and settings on equal footing, i.e., both\nas local beables, and therefore it did not make sense for him to conditionalize on one but not on\nthe other, a point also advocated by Hans Westman (private communication).\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n3.5.2\n\n81\n\nNon-trivial no-signaling Bell-type inequalities\n\nRecall that the CHSH inequality does not suffice for discerning no-signaling correlations from general correlations because no-signaling correlations can reach the absolute maximum of this inequality. Indeed, using only product expectation values it\nwas shown that the no-signaling polytope in the corresponding 4-dimensional space\nof vectors with components hA, Bi, hA, B \u2032 i, hA\u2032 , Bi, hA\u2032 , B \u2032 i is the trivial unit-cube\n(cf. section (2.3.1)). Our analysis must thus be performed in a larger space, and we\nconsider the vectors that have as components in addition to the product expectation\n\u2032\nvalues the marginal ones, i.e., we also consider the quantities hAiB , hAiB , hA\u2032 iB ,\netc. In this space we obtain a set of non-trivial no-signaling Bell-type inequalities\nthat discerns the no-signaling correlations from more general correlations.\nThe trick we use to obtain the new set of inequalities is to combine two different\nRoy-Singh inequalities where the no-signaling constraint is invoked to set hAiB\nns =\n\u2032\nhAiB\n:=\nhAi\n,\netc.\nns\nns\nFor example, consider the following two Roy-Singh inequalities that hold for all\ncorrelations:\n| hABi \u00b1 hAiB | \u2264 1 \u00b1 hBiA ,\n\n(3.62)\n\n\u2032\n\n| hA\u2032 Bi \u00b1 hA\u2032 iB | \u2264 1 \u00b1 hBiA .\n\n(3.63)\n\nUsing the inequality |x + y| \u2264 |x| + |y| (x, y \u2208 R) we obtain\n|hABi + hAiB + hA\u2032 Bi \u2212 hA\u2032 iB | \u2264 |hABi + hAiB | + |hA\u2032 Bi \u2212 hA\u2032 iB |\n\u2032\n\n\u2264 2 + hBiA \u2212 hBiA .\n\n(3.64)\n\n\u2032\n\n42\nA\nAssuming no-signaling (i.e., we set hBiA\nns = hBins := hBins ) gives :\n\u2032 B\n|hABins + hA\u2032 Bins + hAiB\nns \u2212 hA ins | \u2264 2.\n\n(3.65)\n\n42 That this is non-trivial can be shown by giving an example of a signaling correlation that\nviolates (3.65). Consider a deterministic protocol where if A and B are measured jointly party\n1 obtains outcome a11 and party 2 obtains outcome b11 , and, alternatively, if A\u2032 and B are\nmeasured jointly party 1 obtains outcome a21 and party 2 obtains outcome b21 , where b11 6= b21 .\n\u2032\nThen hABi = a11 b11 , hA\u2032 Bi = a21 b21 , hAiB = a11 , hA\u2032 iB = a21 , hBiA = b11 , hBiA = b21 .\n\u2032\nA\nA\nThis is a one-way signaling protocol because hBi 6= hBi .

They are saturated by\nonly 7 affinely independent extreme points instead of the required 8 which is necessary for a facet.\n43 This\n\nis indeed non-trivial. The deterministic signaling protocol where the outcomes are a11 =\na22 = \u22121 and a12 = b12 = a21 = b21 = b11 = b22 = 1 gives hABi = a11 b11 = \u22121, hA\u2032 B \u2032 i =\n\u2032\n\u2032\na22 b22 = \u22121, and hAiB = a12 = 1, hA\u2032 iB = a21 = 1, hBiA = b21 = 1, hB \u2032 iA = b12 = 1 so as to\ngive a value of 6 on the left hand side of (3.67) and which violates this inequality.\n44 There are 6 different permutations that are of two types: 3 different permutations of the\noutcomes: for party 1, for party 2 and for both parties; and 3 different permutations for the\nobservables: permute A with A\u2032 , B with B \u2032 or perform both permutations at once. All different\ncombinations of these six give 64 possibilities of which only 14 give distinct non-trivial inequalities.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n3.5.2.1\n\n83\n\nReproducing perfect (anti-) correlations\n\nThe set of non-trivial inequalities (3.68) shows an interesting constraint on nosignaling correlations that are required to reproduce the perfectly correlated and\n\u221a\nanti-correlated quantum predictions of the two-qubit singlet state (| 01i \u2212 | 10i)/ 2.\nConsider spin measurements in directions a and b on each of the two qubits. It is\nwell known that the singlet state gives perfect anti-correlated predictions when the\nmeasurements are in the same direction, and perfect correlated predictions when\nthey are in opposite directions:\n\u2200 a, b : habi = \u22121, when a = b,\n\u2200 a, b : habi = 1, when a = \u2212b.\n\n(3.69)\n(3.70)\n\nSuppose one wants to reproduce these correlations using a no-signaling correlation,\ni.e., for all a, a\u2032 , b, b\u2032 inequalities (3.68a) and (3.68b) for all admissible \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 must\nhold, where the settings A, B, A, B \u2032 have been denoted by the vectors a, a\u2032 , b, b\u2032\nrespectively. Because of no-signaling the dependence of the marginals on far-away\n\u2032\nsettings is dropped, i.e., haib = haib := hai, etc.\nIn the case where a\u2032 = b = b\u2032 = a the assumption (3.69) together with the\nconstraint (3.68a) for \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1 implies, for all a:\n\u2212haiIns \u2212 haiII\nns \u2265 0.\n\n(3.71)\n\nwhere the two different parties I and II are explicitly indicated, i.e., haiIns for party\nI and haiII\nns for party II.\nFurthermore, non-negativity gives 4P (+ + |ab) + 4P (+ + |a\u2032 b\u2032 ) \u2265 0, which is\nidentical to\nhabins + ha\u2032 b\u2032 ins + hains + hbins + ha\u2032 ins + hb\u2032 ins + 2 \u2265 0.\n\n(3.72)\n\nIn the case where a\u2032 = b = b\u2032 = a assumption (3.69) and the constraint (3.72)\nimply, for all a: haiIns + haiII\nns \u2265 0. Together with (3.71) we thus obtain, for all a:\nhaiIns + haiII\nns = 0.\n\n(3.73)\n\nThis is the first non-trivial constraint.\nThe second constraint follows from the case where \u2212a\u2032 = b = b\u2032 = a. In this\ncase the assumption (3.70) together with the constraints of (3.68b) for \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0\nand \u03b3 = 0, \u03b4 = 1 implies, for all a: haiIns = h\u2212aiII\nns . Together with (3.73) this\nimplies, for all a:\nh\u2212aiIns = \u2212haiIns .\n\n(3.74)\n\nBy symmetry the same holds for party II.\nThus (3.73) and (3.74) are necessary conditions for any no-signaling model to\nreproduce the singlet state perfect (anti-)correlations. These conditions state that\n\n\f84\n\nChapter 3\n\nthe marginal expectation values for party I and II must add up to zero for measurements in the same direction, and the individual marginal expectation values must\nbe odd functions of the settings. Consequently, any model reproducing the singlet\nstate perfect (anti-) correlations and which does not obey either one (or both) of\nthese conditions must be signaling.\nIn case the no-signaling model treats the systems held by party I and II the\nsame, i.e., haiIns = haiII\nns , it must have vanishing marginal expectation values:\nI\nII\nhains = hains = 0. All marginal probabilities then must be uniformly distributed:\nP (+|a) = P (\u2212|a) = 1/2, etc.\nIn case one requires not only the perfect (anti-) correlations for parallel and\nanti-parallel settings but the full singlet state correlation habi = \u2212a * b, \u2200 a, b, the\nrequirement of vanishing marginal expectation values must indeed obtain. Branciard et al. [2008] established this for hidden-variable models of the Leggett type\n(see section 3.3.4), but it holds also for general no-signaling models.\n\n3.6\n\nDiscussion\n\nMany of the investigations in this chapter are not final. We will discuss four interesting and important open problems. The first three are more of a technical nature,\nthe fourth has a foundational character.\n(1) We have shown that a large class of hidden-variable models must obey the\nCHSH inequality despite the fact that the probabilities for outcomes and the hiddenvariable distributions are non-locally setting and outcome dependent. Such a form\nof setting and outcome dependence at the subsurface level is thus sufficient to derive\nthe CHSH inequality. An open question remains what forms of setting and outcome\ndependence would be necessary and sufficient.\nIn view of the comparison of our result to Leggett's model, a related question, not\ninvestigated here, arises. What forms of non-local setting and outcome dependence\nare necessary and sufficient for reproducing quantum mechanical predictions for\nbi-partite quantum systems? Despite interesting progress, see e.g. Brunner et al.\n[2008], even in the most simple case of two dichotomous observables per party this\nis an open question.\n(2) The analysis of Leggett-type models has presented us with interesting relationships between the way different assumptions at the two different hidden-variable\nlevels of such models are related. It is the case that in such models parameter dependence at the deeper hidden-variable level does not show up as parameter dependence\nat the higher hidden-variable level, but only as setting dependence, i.e., as a violation of OI. Conversely, for such models, and in fact for any hidden-variable model\nfor which there is a deeper deterministic level, a violation of OI can be regarded\nas a sign of a violation of deterministic PI at a deeper hidden-variable level. We\nthus see that which conditions are obeyed and which are not depends on the level\nof consideration and on which hidden-variable level is considered to be fundamen-\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n85\n\ntal. An interesting avenue for future research would be to search for other such\nrelationships.\n(3) The surprising result obtained in section 3.4 that any hidden-variable model\nthat is deterministic at the subsurface level but which has no-signaling non-local\ncorrelations at the surface must show randomness in the distribution of the outcomes, asks for a further investigation of the relationship between inferences and\nresults that exist at the levels of surface and subsurface probabilities.\n(4) Although the investigations are not final, we can nevertheless already claim\nthat a foundational question should be asked. Given the arguments against experimental metaphysics that were reviewed in section 3.2.6, and the novel one presented\nhere where a class of non-local setting and outcome dependent hidden-variable models that violate OI, PI and IS was shown to nevertheless obey the CHSH inequality,\nwe are led to ask the following question: how should we understand violations\nof the CHSH inequality? This is a difficult question to answer, since we only have\nrather trivial necessary conditions and some sufficient conditions for when a hiddenvariable model obeys this inequality. But no necessary and sufficient condition has\nbeen found. Therefore, we do not know precisely what a violation amounts to.\nWe think we can say at least this: violation of the CHSH inequality shows that\nwe must give up on one (or more) of the following:\n(i) The non-local outcome dependent versions of OI (as given in (3.43a) and\n(3.43c).

Opting to give up\nthis assumption forces us to give up on even more freedom of the observers to\nchoose settings.\n(iv ) One of Maudlin's conditions P1 or P2 (or both). But note that in section 3.2.5\nit was argued that Maudlin's conditions are rather unnatural because of the\nextra assumptions that are needed to evaluate them in quantum mechanics.\nIf one not carefully takes these findings into account, and acknowledges that\nperhaps more may be found, experimental metaphysics becomes a very dangerous\nfield, full of perhaps metaphysically interesting, but non-instantiated conclusions. It\nwould be too much to ask for a ban on interpreting violations of the CHSH inequality\nuntil a final technical investigation of the issue is available, but we believe we ask\nnot too much to acknowledge the limitations of the technical results upon which\none bases its philosophical endeavors. It is important to recognize this if we are\nto have a proper appreciation of the epistemological situation we are in when we\nattempt to glean metaphysical implications of the failure of the CHSH inequality.\n\n\f86\n\nChapter 3\n\n3.7\n\nAppendices\n\n3.7.1\n\nOn Shimony and Maudlin factorisation\n\nIn this Appendix we will prove45 that the conjunction of Maudlin's assumptions\nimplies Factorisability, just as the conjunction of Shimony's assumption does. Their\ninterrelationship will also be investigated. For completeness, we state Shimony's and\nMaudlin's assumptions again:\nShimony:\nOI :\n\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, \u03bb)\n\nand P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|A, B, \u03bb).\n(3.75)\n\nPI :\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\n\nand P (b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.76)\n\nP1 :\n\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\n\nand P (b|B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.77)\n\nP2 :\n\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, b, \u03bb) and P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, a, \u03bb).\n(3.78)\n\nMaudlin:\n\nOI and PI together imply Factorisability, i.e., P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)P (b|B, \u03bb).\nThe conjunction of P1 and P2 also implies this. We prove this as follows. Consider\nthe general result from the law of conditional probability that:\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) P (a|A, B, \u03bb).\n(3.79)\nApplying P1 and P2 we get:\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb) P (a|A, B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.80)\n\nConsider now the second equality. Supposing that P (b|B, \u03bb) and P (a|A, \u03bb) are\nnon-zero, we can write this as:\nP (b|A, B, \u03bb)\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb)\n=\n.\nP (a|A, \u03bb)\nP (b|B, \u03bb)\n\n(3.81)\n\nMaudlin's claim that the conjunction of P1 and P2 give Factorisability will hold if\nit is the case that (3.81) equals the numerical constant 1. Note that this effectively\nstates the condition of parameter independence. This indeed follows from the conjunction of Maudlin's assumptions P1 and P2.\nProof: Suppose we would have taken another outcome a\u2032 in (3.79), then applying\n45 We\n\nthank Sven Aerts for crucial help in establishing the proof.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n87\n\nP1 and P2 again we would obtain in the same way as which gave us (3.81) the\nfollowing\nP (b|A, B, \u03bb)\nP (a\u2032 |A, B, \u03bb)\n=\n.\nP (a\u2032 |A, \u03bb)\nP (b|B, \u03bb)\n\n(3.82)\n\nCombining this with (3.81) we get\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb)\nP (a\u2032 |A, B, \u03bb)\n=\n.\nP (a|A, \u03bb)\nP (a\u2032 |A, \u03bb)\n\n(3.83)\n\nWe now suppose we are dealing with a standard Bell experiment where all measurements have dichotomous outcomes. The possible outcomes of measuring A are\nthus a, a\u2032 . We therefore have\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb) + P (a\u2032 |A, B, \u03bb) = 1\n\nand P (a|A, \u03bb) + P (a\u2032 |A, \u03bb) = 1.\n\n(3.84)\n\nIf we substitute this into (3.83) we get P (a|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb). We thus have\nparameter independence and if we use this in (3.80) we get Factorisability, having\nassumed only P1 and P2 and the requirement of dichotomous observables:\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.85)\n\nThe requirement of dichotomous observables is not necessary\nSuppose a (and b) are possible outcome variables which have more than two possible\nreal-valued outcomes. Divide the domain of a into two measurable subsets such\nthat the intersection is zero and the union equal the domain of a. Call them S and\nS c , where the latter is the complement of the first. We thus obtain a two valued\nobservable with outcomes S and S c , which, for convenience, can be given the values\n+1 and \u22121 if one wants to. Next define the probability for obtaining one of these\ntwo values as:\nZ\nZ\nc\nP (a) da,\n(3.86)\nP (a) da ,\nP (S ) =\nP (S) =\nSc\n\nS\n\nand analogously for the conditional probabilities.\nOne would then get according to P1:\nZ\nZ\nP (a|A, \u03bb)da = P (S|A, \u03bb).\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb)da =\nP (S|A, b, \u03bb) =\nS\n\n(3.87)\n\nS\n\nAnd according to P2:\nZ\nZ\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb)da = P (S|A, b, \u03bb). (3.88)\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb)da =\nP (S|A, B, b, \u03bb) =\nS\n\nThe same holds for P (S c | . . .).\n\nS\n\n\f88\n\nChapter 3\n\nThus all functional dependencies of the a probabilities are reproduced on the\nlevel of the S probabilities. Suppose that we divide the set of outcomes of the\nobservable b into two subsets T and T c , where the latter is again the complement\nof the first. From the above proof that P1 and P2 imply Factorisability for the case\nof dichotomous observables we can conclude that since S, S c and T , T c represent\ndichotomous observables, that P (S, T |a, b, \u03bb) factorises. Since this has to hold for\nall possible choices of measurable subsets S, S c and T , T c Factorisability must also\nhold for P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb).\n\nOn the conjunction of Maudlin's P1 and P2\nFrom the above proof we see that the following requirement also implies Factorisability\nP3 :\n\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\n\nand P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb).\n\n(3.89)\n\nP1 and P2 imply P3 as can be seen by combining (3.79) and (3.80). But could it\nbe that P3 is weaker than P1 and P2 in conjunction? That is, is it possible that\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb), and either \u00ac P1 (i.e., P (a|A, b, \u03bb) 6= P (a|A, \u03bb)) or \u00ac P2\n(i.e., P (a|A, B, B, \u03bb) 6= P (a|A, B, \u03bb))? Since P1, P2 and P3 have to hold for all\npossible outcomes this is not possible.\nProof:\n(A) P3=\u21d2 P1: We have that\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bb) + P (a|A, B, \u00ac b, \u03bb) (1 \u2212 P (b|A, B, \u03bb)),\n(3.90)\nbecause P (X|Y ) = P (X|Y Z) P (Y |Z) + P (X|\u00ac Y Z) (1 \u2212 P (Y |Z)) for all X, Y, Z. If\nwe assume P3, i.e., if P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) and P (a|A, B, \u00ac b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb),\nthen from (3.90) we see that P (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb).\n(B) P3=\u21d2 P2: Since P3 implies P1, it follows from P3 that P3 \u2227 P1. Thus:\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) \u2227 P (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\n\n=\u21d2 P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, b, \u03bb),\n\n(3.91)\n\nwhich is P2.\n\nConclusion\nWe have shown that the conjunction of P1 and P2 is equivalent to P3 which is\nequivalent to Factorisability. Shimony has already shown that the conjunction of OI\nand PI is equivalent to Factorisability. This gives us the following logical relations:\nOI \u2227 PI \u21d0\u21d2 P1 \u2227 P2 \u21d0\u21d2 P3 \u21d0\u21d2 Factorisability\n\n(3.92)\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n3.7.2\n\n89\n\nShimony's and Maudlin's conditions in quantum\nmechanics\n\nQuantum mechanics can be considered as a stochastic hidden-variable theory where\nthe hidden variable \u03bb is effectively the quantum state | \u03c8i, i.e., \u03c1(\u03bb) = \u03b4(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\nwith \u03bb0 = | \u03c8i (actually, the quantum state need not be a pure state). The joint\nprobabilities46 are then obtained via\nP (ai , bj |A, B, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[\u00c2i \u2297 B\u0302j | \u03c8ih \u03c8|],\n\n(3.93)\n\nand the marginals are\nP (ai |A, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[\u00c2i \u03c1I ],\n\nand P (bj |B, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[B\u0302j \u03c1II ],\n\n(3.94)\n\nwith \u03c1I and \u03c1II the reduced density matrices for subsystems I and II respectively,\nP\nP\nand we consider POVM's {\u00c2i }, and {B\u0302j } with i \u00c2i = j B\u0302j = 1.\n(I) Shimony's OI and PI: Considered as a stochastic hidden-variable theory quantum mechanics obeys PI but violates OI. Proof:\nP\n\u0088 PI is obeyed, because \u2200i, j: P (ai |A, B, \u03bb0 ) = j Tr[\u00c2i \u2297 B\u0302j | \u03c8ih \u03c8|] = Tr[\u00c2i \u2297\n1| \u03c8ih \u03c8|] = Tr[\u00c2i \u03c1I ] = P (ai |A, \u03bb0 ), and analogously we find P (bj |A, B, \u03bb0 ) =\nP (bj |B, \u03bb0 ).\n\u221a\n\u0088 OI is violated. For example, take | \u03c8i to be the singlet state (| 01i \u2212 | 10i)/ 2.\nIn case A and B are chosen to be equal this state predicts:\nP (a+ , b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[\u00c2+ \u2297 B\u0302+ | \u03c8ih \u03c8|] = 0,\nP (a+ |A, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[\u00c2+ \u03c1I ] = P (b+ |B, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[B\u0302+ \u03c1II ] =\n\n1\n.\n2\n\n(3.95)\n\nHere a+ and b+ denote the outcomes +1 and \u00c2+ , B\u0302+ the POVM element\nassociated to these outcomes respectively. The predictions of the singlet state\nviolate OI, since P (a+ , b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 ) 6= P (a+ |A, B, \u03bb0 )P (b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 ). Indeed,\nP (a+ , b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 ) = Tr[\u00c2+ \u2297 B\u0302+ | \u03c8ih \u03c8|] = 0, whereas\nX\nX\nP (a+ |A, B, \u03bb0 )P (b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 ) =\nP (a+ , b|A, B, \u03bb0 )\nP (a, b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 )\n=\n\nX\nj\n\nb\n\nTr[\u00c2+ \u2297 B\u0302j | \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\n\nX\ni\n\na\n\nTr[\u00c2i \u2297 B\u0302+ | \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\n1\n.\n4\n(3.96)\n\n= Tr[\u00c2+ \u2297 1| \u03c8ih \u03c8|] Tr[1 \u2297 B\u0302j | \u03c8ih \u03c8|] = Tr[\u00c2+ \u03c1I ]Tr[B\u0302+ \u03c1II ] =\n46 These\n\nprobabilities conditional on quantum states denote probabilities prescribed by those\nstates. Although this commits us to probabilities for certain quantum states to be prepared, this\ncan be easily removed by a reformulation where states are treated as parameters and not as random\nvariables, cf. [Clifton et al., 1991, p. 5].\n\n\f90\n\nChapter 3\n\n(II) Maudlin's P1 and P2:\nIn order to evaluate P1 and P2 we need to evaluate the probabilities P (a|A, \u03bb),\nP (b|B, \u03bb) via (3.94) and P (a|A, B, b, \u03bb), P (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) via (3.93); but we need also\nevaluate P (a|A, b, \u03bb) and P (b|B, a, \u03bb). However, quantum mechanics, when considered as a stochastic hidden-variable theory, does not specify such latter probabilities. Quantum mechanics only specifies probabilities for outcomes given that one\nhas chosen certain settings, i.e., it only allows one to calculate (3.93) and (3.94).\nThe theory does not specify probabilities for settings to be chosen, and we need\nthese to evaluate Maudlin's conditional probabilities P (a|A, b, \u03bb) and P (b|B, a, \u03bb),\nas we will now show.\nConsider the big joint probability P (a, b, A, B, \u03bb). Note that this assumes the\nsettings A and B to be random variables (ranging over some set \u039bA and \u039bB respectively). The relation\nZ\ndB P (a, b, A, B, \u03bb) =P (a, b, A, \u03bb) = P (a|A, b, \u03bb)P (b, A, \u03bb) =\n\u039bB\nZ\nZ\nda P (a, b, A, B, \u03bb),\n(3.97)\ndB\np(a|A, b, \u03bb)\n\u039bB\n\n\u039ba\n\ngives the sought after conditional probability\nR\ndB P (a, b, A, B, \u03bb)\n,\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb) = R \u039bB R\n\u039bB dB \u039ba da P (a, b, A, B, \u03bb)\n\n(3.98)\n\nand analogous for P (b|B, a, \u03bb). We can furthermore write the joint probability\nP (a, b, A, B, \u03bb) as P (a, b, A, B, \u03bb) = P (a, b|A, B, \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bb, A, B) by the law of conditional probability, where \u03c1(\u03bb, A, B) is a joint probability distribution of the hiddenvariable \u03bb and settings A, B.\nNow we invoke quantum mechanics. This theory obeys IS, i.e., \u03c1(\u03bb, A, B) =\n\u03c1(\u03bb)\u03c1(A, B) because the quantum state is independent of the settings chosen. The\nhidden variable \u03bb is again chosen to be the quantum state | \u03c8i, i.e. \u03c1(\u03bb) = \u03b4(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\nwith \u03bb0 = | \u03c8i. In this way quantum mechanics gives (3.93), (3.94) (where, without\nrestriction, the outcomes are taken to be discrete so that they can be labeled by\ni, j respectively). But this is not sufficient to evaluate (3.98). Quantum mechanics\ndoes not specify how to proceed any further, and, in order to do so we have to make\nsome extra assumption about the probabilities \u03c1(A, B) for settings to be chosen.\nThe extra assumption we adopt is that the observables can be chosen freely.\nWe take this to imply two things. Firstly, that the observables measured on each\n \u0303\nsubsystem are independent, i.e., \u03c1(A, B) = \u03c1\u0303(A)\u03c1\u0303(B).\nSecondly, the specific way\noutcomes ai are related to POVM elements \u00c2i is asymmetric: once a POVM is\nchosen the relationship between an outcome that can be obtained and its associated\nPOVM element is uniquely determined, but if only an outcome is given, many\nPOVM's can be associated to this outcome, as well as many POVM elements. All\nthat matters is some unique labeling between POVM elements and outcomes. This\ncan be chosen freely. But after it is chosen one should stick to it for consistency.\n\n\fLocal realism, hidden variables and correlations\n\n91\n\nLet us now label the POVM's by x and its POVM elements by j x , so a POVM\nP\n \u0303\ngives a POVM\nis given by {B\u0302j x }, with j x B\u0302j x = 1, \u2200x. The distribution \u03c1\u0303(B)\nR\nP\n{B\u0302j x } a weight \u03b3x , with x \u03b3x = 1. Since the outcomes are discrete, \u039ba da is a\nP\nsum over i:\ni . Also, since we only consider a given outcome bj , and not some\nparticular observable, we are free to chose which POVM is going to be measured\nR\nand which POVM element we associate to this outcome, and thus \u039bB dB is a sum\nP\nP\nover both x and j x :\nx\njx .\nThis finally allows for rewriting (3.98) as:\nP P\nx\n\nP (ai |bj , A, \u03bb) = P P\nx\n\n\u03b3x Tr[\u00c2i \u2297 B\u0302j x | \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\nP\ni \u03b3x Tr[\u00c2i \u2297 B\u0302j x | \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\njx\njx\n\nPerforming the summations gives:\nP\n\u03b3x Tr[\u00c2i \u2297 1| \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\nP (ai |bj , A, \u03bb) = Px\n= Tr[\u00c2i \u2297 1| \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\nx \u03b3x Tr[1 \u2297 1| \u03c8ih \u03c8|]\n\n= Tr[\u00c2i \u03c1I ] = P (ai |A, \u03bb)\n\n(3.99)\n\n(3.100)\n\nThis implies that P1 is obeyed: P (ai |A, bj , \u03bb) = P (ai |A, \u03bb). And, of course, by\nsymmetry we obtain P (bj |B, ai , \u03bb0 ) = P (bj |B, \u03bb).\nP2 is violated. Proof: Consider again the singlet state \u03bb0 = | \u03c8i. This state\ngives P (a+ |A, B, b+ , \u03bb0 ) = P (a+ , b+ |A, B, \u03bb0 )/P (a+ |A, B, \u03bb0 ) = 0 whereas it is the\ncase that\nP1\nP (a+ |A, b+ , \u03bb0 ) = P (a+ |A, \u03bb0 ) = 1/2 so that P (a+ |A, B, b+ , \u03bb0 ) 6= P (a+ |A, \u03bb0 ).\nHere we have had to use P1.\nAnalogously we obtain that P (b+ |A, B, a+ , \u03bb0 ) 6= P (b+ |B, a+ , \u03bb0 ).\n\n\f92\n\n3.8\n\nChapter 3\n\nList of acronyms for this chapter\n\nIS: Independence of the Source\n\n\u03c1(\u03bb|AB) = \u03c1(\u03bb)\n\nAF: Apparatus Factorisability\n\n\u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A, B) \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B)\n\nAL: Apparatus Locality\n\n\u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A)\n\u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B)\n\nTAF: Total Apparatus Factorisability\n\u03c1(\u03bcA , \u03bcB |\u03bb, A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A) \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B)\nISA: Independence of the Source and Apparata\n\u03c1(\u03bb, \u03bcA , \u03bcB |A, B) = \u03c1(\u03bcA |\u03bb, A) \u03c1(\u03bcB |\u03bb, B)\u03c1(\u03bb)\nLD: Local Determination\n\na(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = a(A, \u03bcA , \u03bb)\nb(A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = b(B, \u03bcB , \u03bb)\n\nOL: Outcome Locality\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bcA , \u03bb)\nP (b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bcB , \u03bb)\n\nOF: Outcome Factorisability\n\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) =\nP (a|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb)\n\nTF: Total Factorisability\n\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bcA , \u03bcB , \u03bb) = P (a|B, \u03bcA , \u03bb) P (b|B, \u03bcB , \u03bb)\n\nPI: Parameter Independence\n\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, B, \u03bb) P (b|A, B, \u03bb)\n\nOI: Outcome Independence\n\nP (a|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\nP (b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb)\n\nP1: Maudlin's OI\n\nP (a|A, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\nP (b|B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb)\n\nP2: Maudlin's PI\n\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, b, \u03bb)\nP (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, a, \u03bb)\n\nP3:\n\nP (a|A, B, b, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb)\nP (b|A, B, a, \u03bb) = P (b|B, \u03bb)\n\nFactorisability:\n\nP (a, b|A, B, \u03bb) = P (a|A, \u03bb) P (b|B, \u03bb)\n\n\fChapter 4\n\n93\n\nStrengthened CHSH separability\ninequalities\nThis chapter is largely based on Uffink and Seevinck [2008].\n\n4.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe current interest in the study of entangled quantum states derives from two\nsources: their role in the foundations of quantum mechanics [Horodecki et al., 2007]\nand their applicability in practical problems of information processing such as quantum communication and computation [Nielsen and Chuang, 2000].\nBell-type inequalities likewise serve a dual purpose. Originally, they were designed in order to answer a foundational question dealt with in the previous chapter:\nto test the predictions of quantum mechanics against those of a local hidden-variable\n(LHV) theory. However, these inequalities also provide a test to distinguish entangled from separable (unentangled) quantum states [Gisin, 1991; Horodecki et al.,\n1995]. Indeed, experimenters routinely use violations of a CHSH inequality to check\nwhether they have succeeded in producing bi-partite entangled states. This problem of entanglement detection is crucial in all experimental applications of quantum\ninformation processing.\nIt is the goal of this chapter to report that in the case of the standard CHSH\ninequality experiment, i.e., for two distant spin-1/2 particles, significantly stronger\ninequalities hold for separable states in the case of locally orthogonal observables.\nThese inequalities provide sharper tools for entanglement detection, and are readily applicable to recent experiments such as performed by Volz et al. [2006] and\nStevenson et al. [2006]. In fact, if they hold for all sets of locally orthogonal observables they are necessary and sufficient for separability, so the violation of these\nseparability inequalities is not only a sufficient but also a necessary condition for\nentanglement. They furthermore advance upon the necessary and sufficient sepa-\n\n\f94\n\nChapter 4\n\nrability inequalities of Yu et al. [2003], since, in contrast to these, the inequalities\npresented here do not need to assume that the orientations of the measurement\nbasis for each qubit are the same, so no shared reference frame is necessary.\nWe show the strength and efficiency of the separability criteria by showing that\nthey are stronger than other sufficient and experimentally accessible criteria for twoqubit entanglement while using the same measurement settings. These are (i) the\nso-called fidelity criterion [Sackett et al., 2000; Seevinck and Uffink, 2001], and (ii)\nrecent linear and non-linear entanglement witnesses [Yu and Liu, 2005; G\u00fchne et al.,\n2006; Zhang et al., 2007]. However, in order to implement all of the above criteria\nsuccessfully, the observables have to be chosen in a specific way which depends on\nthe state to be detected. So in general one needs some prior knowledge about this\nstate. In order to circumvent this experimental drawback we discuss the problem\nof whether a finite subset of the separability inequalities could already provide a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for separability. For mixed states we have not\nbeen able to resolve this, but for pure states a set of six inequalities using only\nthree sets of orthogonal observables is shown to be already necessary and sufficient\nfor separability.\nThe inequalities, however, are not applicable to the original purpose of testing\nLHV theories. This shows that the purpose of testing entanglement within quantum\ntheory, and the purpose of testing quantum mechanics against LHV theories are not\nequivalent, a point already demonstrated by Werner [1989]. Our analysis follows up\non Werner's observation by showing that the correlations achievable by all separable\ntwo-qubit states in a standard Bell experiment are tied to a bound strictly less than\nthose achievable for LHV models. In other words, quantum theory needs entangled\ntwo-qubit states even to produce the latter type of correlations. As an illustration,\nwe exhibit a class of entangled two-qubit states, including the Werner states, whose\ncorrelations in the standard Bell experiment possess a reconstruction in terms of a\nlocal hidden-variable model.\nThis chapter is organized as follows. In section 2, we rehearse the CHSH inequalities for separable two-qubit states in the standard setting and derive a stronger\nbound for orthogonal observables. In section 3, we compare this result with that\nof LHV theories and argue that the stronger bound does not hold in that case. In\nsection 4, we return to quantum theory and derive an even stronger bound than\nin section 2 which provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability of\nall quantum two-qubit states, pure or mixed. Furthermore, it is shown that the\norientation of the measurement basis is not relevant for the criterion to be valid.\nSection 5 compares the strength of these inequalities with some other criteria for\nseparability of two-qubit states, not based on Bell-type inequalities. Also, it is\ninvestigated whether a finite subset of the inequalities of section 4 could already\nprovide a necessary and sufficient separability condition. Section 6 summarizes our\nconclusions.\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\n\n4.2\n\n95\n\nBell-type inequalities as a test for\nentanglement\n\nConsider a bipartite quantum system in the familiar setting of a standard Bell\nexperiment: Two experimenters at distant sites each receive one subsystem and\nchoose to measure one of two dichotomous observables: A or A\u2032 at the first site,\nand B or B \u2032 at the second. We assume that all observables have the spectrum\n{\u22121, 1}. Let us consider the so-called CHSH operator [Braunstein et al., 1992]\nB := AB + AB \u2032 + A\u2032 B \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nWe write AB etc., as shorthand for A \u2297 B and hABi\u03c1 := Tr[\u03c1A \u2297 B] or hABi\u03a8 =\nh \u03a8|A \u2297 B| \u03a8i for the expectations1 of AB in the mixed state \u03c1 or pure state | \u03a8i.\nSince hBi\u03c1 := Tr[B\u03c1] is a convex function of the quantum state \u03c1 for the system,\nits maximum is attained for pure states. In fact, Tsirelson [1980] already proved\nthat max\u03c1 |hBi\u03c1 | can be attained in a pure two-qubit state (with associated Hilbert\nspace H = C2 \u2297 C2 ) and for spin observables.\nIn the following it will thus suffice to consider only qubits (spin-1/2 particles)\nP\nand the usual traceless spin observables, e.g. A = a * \u03c3 = i ai \u03c3i , with kak = 1,\ni = x, y, z and \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z the familiar Pauli spin operators on the state space H = C2 ,\nwhich has as a standard basis the set {| 0i, | 1i} which are the spin-states for \"up\"\nand \"down\" in the z-direction of a single qubit.\nIt is well known that for all such observables and all separable states, i.e., states\nof the form \u03c1 = \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 or convex mixtures of such states (to be denoted as \u03c1 \u2208\nDsep ), the Bell inequality in the form derived by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt\n(CHSH) [Clauser et al., 1969] holds:\n|hBi\u03c1 | = |hAB + AB \u2032 + A\u2032 B \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 | \u2264 2,\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe maximal violation of (4.2) follows from an inequality by Tsirelson [1980] (cf.\n[Landau, 1987]) that holds for all quantum states (denoted as \u03c1 \u2208 D):\n\u221a\n(4.3)\n|hBi\u03c1 | = |hAB + AB \u2032 + A\u2032 B \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 | \u2264 2 2, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D.\nEquality in (4.3) \u2013and thus the maximal violation of inequality (4.2) allowed in\nquantum mechanics\u2013 is attained by e.g. the pure entangled states | \u03c6\u00b1 i = \u221a12 (| 00i\u00b1\n| 11i) and | \u03c8 \u00b1 i = \u221a12 (| 01i \u00b1 | 10i).\nUffink [2002] furthermore showed that for all such observables and for all states\n\u03c1 the following inequality must be obeyed:\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03c1 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03c1 \u2264 4,\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D,\n\n(4.4)\n\n1 In this chapter, as well as in chapters 5 and 6, we will leave out the subscript 'qm' in hAi\nqm ,\netc., for ease of notation.\n\n\f96\n\nChapter 4\n\nwhich strengthens the Tsirelson inequality (4.3). This quadratic inequality (4.4)\nis likewise saturated for maximally entangled states like | \u03c8 \u00b1 i and | \u03c6\u00b1 i. Unfortunately, no smaller bound on the left-hand side of (4.4) exists for separable states,\nas long as the choice of observables is kept general. (To verify this, take | \u03a8i = | 00i\nand A = A\u2032 = B = B \u2032 = \u03c3z ). Thus, the quadratic inequality (4.4) does not distinguish entangled and separable states. We now show that a much more stringent\nbound can be found on the left-hand side of (4.4) for separable two-qubit states\nwhen a suitable choice of observables is made, exploiting an idea used in a different\ncontext by T\u00f3th et al. [2005].\nFor the case of the singlet state | \u03c8 \u2212 i, it has long been known that an optimal choice of the spin observables for the purpose of finding violations of the Bell\ninequality requires that A, A\u2032 and B, B \u2032 are pairwise orthogonal, and many experiments have chosen this setting. And for general states, it is only in such locally\northogonal configurations that one can hope to attain equality in inequality (4.3)\n[Popescu and Rohrlich, 1992b; Werner and Wolf, 2000; Seevinck and Uffink, 2007].\nIt is not true, however, that for any given state \u03c1 the maximum of the left hand side\nof the CHSH inequality always requires orthogonal settings [Gisin, 1991; Horodecki\net al., 1995; Popescu and Rohrlich, 1992a].\nHowever this may be, we will from now on assume local orthogonality, i.e.,\nA \u22a5 A\u2032 and B \u22a5 B \u2032 (for the case of two qubits this amounts to the local observables\nanti-commuting with each other: {A, A\u2032 } = 0 = {B, B \u2032 }). Furthermore, assume for\nthe moment that the two-particle state is pure and separable. We may thus write\n\u03c1 = | \u03a8ih \u03a8|, where | \u03a8i = | \u03c8i| \u03c6i, to obtain:\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03a8 +hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03a8\n\n\u00012\n\u00012\n= hAi\u03c8 hB \u2032 i\u03c6 + hA\u2032 i\u03c8 hBi\u03c6 + hAi\u03c8 hBi\u03c6 \u2212 hA\u2032 i\u03c8 hB \u2032 i\u03c6\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(4.5)\n= hAi2\u03c8 + hA\u2032 i2\u03c8 hBi2\u03c6 + hB \u2032 i2\u03c6 .\n\nNow, for any spin- 12 state \u03c1 on H = C2 , and any orthogonal triple of spin components A, A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 , one has\nhAi2\u03c1 + hA\u2032 i2\u03c1 + hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 \u2264 1,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwith equality for pure states only. Thus we have for any pure state | \u03c8i that hAi2\u03c8 +\nhA\u2032 i2\u03c8 + hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c8 = 1, and similarly hBi2\u03c6 + hB \u2032 i2\u03c6 + hB \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c6 = 1. Therefore, we can\nwrite (4.5) as:\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03a8 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03a8 = 1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c8\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 hB \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c6 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThis result for pure separable states can be extended to any mixed separable state\nby noting that the density operator of any such state is a convex combination\nP\nof the density operators for pure product-states, i.e. \u03c1 =\ni pi | \u03a8i ih \u03a8i |, with\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\nP\n\n97\n\npi = 1. We may thus write for such states:\nX q\n\u00012\npi hAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2i + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2i\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03c1 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03c1 \u2264\n\n| \u03a8i i = | \u03c8i i| \u03c6i i, pi \u2265 0 and\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\npi\n\nq\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u0001\u00012\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2264 1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 1 \u2212 hB \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 ,\n1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i2i 1 \u2212 hB \u2032\u2032 i2i\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep .\n(4.8)\n\nHere, h*ii an expectation value with respect to | \u03a8i i (e.g., hA\u2032\u2032 ii := h \u03a8i |A\u2032\u2032 \u22971| \u03a8i i)\nand hA\u2032\u2032 i\u03c1 := hA\u2032\u2032 \u2297 1i\u03c1 , etc.\nq\n\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03c1 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03c1 is a convex\nq\n\u0001\n\u0001\nfunction of \u03c1 and the second because\n1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 1 \u2212 hB \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 is concave in \u03c1.\n(To verify this, it is helpful to use the general lemma that for all positive concave\n\u221a\nfunctions f and g, the function f g is concave.)\nThus, we obtain for all two-qubit separable states and locally orthogonal triples\nA \u22a5 A\u2032 \u22a5 A\u2032\u2032 , B \u22a5 B \u2032 \u22a5 B \u2032\u2032 :\n\u0001\n\u0001\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03c1 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03c1 \u2264 1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 1 \u2212 hB \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep . (4.9)\nThe first inequality follows because\n\nClearly, the right-hand side of this inequality is bounded by 1. However, as noted\nbefore, entangled states can saturate inequality (4.4) \u2013 even for orthogonal observables \u2013 and attain the value of 4 for the left-hand side and thus clearly violate the bound (4.9). In contrast to (4.4), inequality (4.9) thus does provide a\ncriterion for testing entanglement. The strength of this bound for entanglement\ndetection in comparison with the traditional CHSH inequality (4.2) may be illustrated by considering the region of values it allows in the (hXi\u03c1 , hY i\u03c1 )-plane, where\nhXi\u03c1 = hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 and hY i\u03c1 = hAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi\u03c1 , cf. Fig. 4.1. Note that even in\nthe weakest case, (i.e., if hA\u2032\u2032 i\u03c1 = hB \u2032\u2032 i\u03c1 = 0), it wipes out just over 60% of the area\nallowed by inequality (4.2). This quadratic\n\u221a inequality even implies a strengthening\nof the CHSH inequality (4.2) by a factor 2:\n\u221a\n(4.10)\n|hBi\u03c1 | = |hAB + AB \u2032 + A\u2032 B \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 | \u2264 2, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep ,\n\nrecently obtained by Roy [2005]. In fact, even if one chooses only one pair (say\nB, B \u2032 ) orthogonal, and let A, A\u2032 be arbitrary, one would obtain an upper bound of\n2 in (4.9), and still improve upon the CHSH inequality. Another pleasant feature of\ninequality (4.9) is that for pure states it's violation, for all sets of local orthogonal\nobservables, is a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement (see Appendix\nA on p. 108). Also, for future purposes we note that the expression in left-hand\nside is invariant under rotations of A, A\u2032 around the axis A\u2032\u2032 and rotations of B, B \u2032\naround B \u2032\u2032 .\nThe inequalities (4.9) present a necessary criterion for a quantum state to be\nseparable2 \u2013and its violation thus a sufficient criterion for entanglement\u2013, but in\n2 Note\n\nthat using only two correlation terms (instead of four as in (4.10)) one can already find\n\n\f98\n\nChapter 4\nhY i\u03c1\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n2\n\u221a\n\n2\n\n1\n\nhXi\u03c1\n\nFigure 4.1: Comparing the regions in the (hXi, hY i)-plane allowed (i) by the tight bound\n(4.4) for all quantum states (inside the largest circle); (ii) by the CHSH bound (4.2) for\nall separable states (inside the second largest tilted square); (iii) by the stronger tight\nbound (4.9) for separable states in case of usage of locally orthogonal observables (inside\nthe circle with radius 1). The quadratic bounds give rise to the familiar Tsirelson bound\n(4.3) (inside the largest tilted square; interrupted line); and the linear bound (4.10) (inside\nthe smallest tilted square; interrupted line).\n\ncontrast to pure states, they are clearly not sufficient for separability of mixed states.\nIn section 4.4 we shall present an even stronger set of inequalities that is necessary\nand sufficient for mixed states as well, but we will first present an alternative form\nof Figure 4.1 as well as discuss in section 4.3 the results obtained so far in the light\nof LHV theories.\n\nFigure 4.1 in terms of the CHSH inequality\nWe give another geometrical representation of the inequalities obtained so far. We\nbelieve it is easier to relate to than the representation in Figure 4.1 because it is\nnot in terms of the rather unfamiliar quantities hXi\u03c1 and hY i\u03c1 but in terms of\na separability criterion for the case of two qubits (also noted by T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne [2006]), namely\n(4.9) implies that \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D22-sep : |hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 | \u2264 1/2. Violation of this inequality thus gives an\nentanglement criterion, i.e., if |hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 | > 1/2 then \u03c1 is entangled. In fact, a maximally\nentangled state can give rise to |hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i\u03c1 | = 1 a factor two higher than for separable states.\nThe same of course holds for the choice hAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi\u03c1 .\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\n\n99\n\nthe expectation values of the more familiar CHSH operators B and B \u2032 , where B \u2032 =\nA\u2032 B \u2032 + AB \u2032 + A\u2032 B \u2212 AB (i.e., compared to B the primed and unprimed observables\nare interchanged).

The locality\ncondition is expressed by the factorization condition Pa,b (a, b|\u03bb) = Pa (a|\u03bb)Pb (b|\u03bb).\nThe assumption to be added to such an LHV theory in order to obtain the\nstrengthened inequality (4.9) is the requirement that for any orthogonal choice of\nA, A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 and for every given \u03bb we have the analog of (4.6) which is\nhAi2lhv + hA\u2032 i2lhv + hA\u2032\u2032 i2lhv = 1,\n\n(4.18)\n\nhAi2lhv + hA\u2032 i2lhv \u2264 1,\n\n(4.19)\n\nor at least\n\nP\nwhere hAilhv = a=\u00b11 a Pa (a|\u03bb), etc.\nBut a requirement like (4.18) or (4.19) is by no means obvious for a local hiddenvariable theory. Indeed, as has often been pointed out, such a theory may employ a\nmathematical framework which is completely different from quantum theory. There\nis no a priori reason why the orthogonality of spin directions should have any\nparticular significance in the hidden-variable theory, and why such a theory should\nconfirm to quantum mechanics in reproducing (4.19) if one conditionalizes on a\ngiven hidden-variable state. (One is reminded here of Bell's critique [Bell, 1966,\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\n\n101\n\n1971] on von Neumann's 'no-go theorem', cf. chapter 2, section 2.4.) Indeed, (4.19)\nis violated by Bell's own example of an LHV model [Bell, 1964] and in fact it must\nfail in every deterministic LHV theory (where all probabilities Pa (a|\u03bb), Pb (b|\u03bb) are\neither 0 or 1), since for those theories hAi2lhv = hA\u2032 i2lhv = hA\u2032\u2032 i2lhv = 1. Thus, the\nadditional requirement (4.19) would appear entirely unmotivated within an LHV\ntheory.\nIt thus appears that testing for entanglement within quantum theory and testing\nquantum mechanics against the class of all LHV theories are not equivalent issues.\nOf course, this conclusion is not new: Werner [1989] already constructed an explicit\nLHV model for a specific two-qubit entangled state. Consider the so-called Werner\n\u2212\n\u2212\nstates: \u03c1W = 1\u2212p\n4 1 + p| \u03c8 ih \u03c8 |, p \u2208 [0, 1]. Werner [1989] showed that these states\nare entangled if p > 1/3, but nevertheless possess an LHV model for p = 1/2. The\nabove inequality (4.9) suggests that the phenomenon exhibited by this Werner state\nis much more ubiquitous, i.e., that many more entangled two-qubit states have an\nLHV model. We will show that this is indeed the case.\nIt is not easy to find the general set of quantum states that possess an LHV\nmodel [Werner, 1989; Ac\u0131\u0301n et al., 2006a]. Certainly, the question cannot be decided\nby considering orthogonal observables only. However, as shown in Appendix B on\np. 108, it is possible to determine the class of two-qubit states for which\nmax\n\nA\u22a5A\u2032 ,B\u22a5B \u2032\n\nhAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03c1 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03c1 > 1\n\n(4.20)\n\nholds (they are thus entangled), and which in addition satisfy the CHSH inequalities\nof Eq. (4.2) for all choices of observables, i.e., not restricted to orthogonal directions.\nSince the latter are known [Werner and Wolf, 2001; \u017bukowski and Brukner,\n2002; Fine, 1982; Pitowsky, 1989] to form a necessary and sufficient set of conditions\nfor the existence of an LHV model for all standard Bell experiments on spin-1/2\nparticles, we conclude that all correlations obtained from such entangled two-qubit\nstates can be reconstructed by an LHV model4 . It follows from Appendix B on\np. \u221a\n108 that this class of states includes the Werner states for the region 1/2 < p \u2264\n1/ 2, which complements results obtained by Horodecki\n\u221a et al. [1995] in which the\nnon-existence of an LHV model is demonstrated for 1/ 2 < p \u2264 1.\nIt is important to realize that the above only holds for the case of qubits. The\ncrucial relation (4.6) can be violated for systems whose state space is a larger Hilbert\nspace than the single qubit state space H = C2 . The observables A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 that\nare locally orthogonal spin observables correspond to pairwise anti-commuting operators only in the case of a qubit. For systems with a large enough Hilbert space\nthey can be commuting. Simply choose this Hilbert space to be the direct sum of\nthe eigenspaces of the three spin observables so that they do not have any overlap.\nThus by choosing the Hilbert space of the systems under consideration to be large\n4 Note that experiments with more general measurement scenarios (e.g., collective, sequential\nor postselected measurements) might still produce correlations incompatible with any LHV model.\nHowever, we will not discuss this issue.\n\n\f102\n\nChapter 4\n\nenough one can obtain commuting observables for any choice of observables. Using separable states of a system consisting of two such systems one can, after all,\nreproduce the predictions of all LHV models.\nThus one may take an experimental violation of the separability inequality (4.9)\n(and its strengthened version, see the next section) using two-qubits to mean two\nthings: (i) either one can conclude that the state of the two-qubits is entangled, or\n(ii) the state might be separable but then one is not dealing with qubits after all\nand some degrees of freedom must have been overlooked.\n\n4.4\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for\nseparability\n\nThe inequalities (4.9) can be strengthened even further. To see this it is useful to introduce, for some given pair of locally orthogonal triples (A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ) and (B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 ),\neight new two qubit operators on H = C2 \u2297 C2 :\n1\n(1 + A\u2032\u2032 B \u2032\u2032 )\n2\n1\nX := (AB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 )\n2\n1\nY := (A\u2032 B + AB \u2032 )\n2\n1\nZ := (A\u2032\u2032 + B \u2032\u2032 )\n2\nI :=\n\n1\nI \u0303 := (1 \u2212 A\u2032\u2032 B \u2032\u2032 )\n2\n1\nX\u0303 := (AB + A\u2032 B \u2032 )\n2\n1 \u2032\n\u1ef8 := (A B \u2212 AB \u2032 )\n2\n1 \u2032\u2032\nZ\u0303 := (A \u2212 B \u2032\u2032 ) ,\n2\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere 12 (A\u2032\u2032 + B \u2032\u2032 ) is shorthand for 21 (A\u2032\u2032 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 B \u2032\u2032 ), etc. Note that X 2 =\nY 2 = Z 2 = I 2 = I and similar for their tilde versions, and that all eight operators\nmutually anti-commute. Furthermore, if the orientations of the two triples is the\nsame (e.g., [A, A\u2032 ] = 2iA\u2032\u2032 and [B, B \u2032 ] = 2iB \u2032\u2032 ), they form two representations of the\ngeneralized Pauli-group, i.e. they have the same commutation relations as the Pauli\nmatrices on C2 , i.e.: [X, Y ] = 2iZ, etc., and hXi2 + hY i2 + hZi2 = hIi2 (analogous\nfor the tilde version). Note that these two sets transform in each other by replacing\nB \u2032 \u2212\u2192 \u2212B \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 \u2212\u2192 \u2212B \u2032\u2032 .\nNow we can repeat the argument of section 2.

Of course, this conclusion does\nnot hold for mixed\nseparable states.\nq\nq\n\nhXi2\u03c1 + hY i2\u03c1 and hX\u0303i2\u03a8 + h\u1ef8 i2\u03c1 are convex functions of \u03c1 whereas\nq\nq\nq\n\u0001\n\u0001\n \u0303 2 \u2212 hZ\u0303i2\nthe three expressions hIi2\u03c1 \u2212 hZi2\u03c1 , 14\n1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 1 \u2212 hB \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 and hIi\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nHowever,\n\nare all concave in \u03c1.

The next obvious question is\nthen which of the three right-hand sides in (4.24) provides the lowest upper bound.\nIt is not difficult to show that the ordering of these three expressions depends on the\ncorrelation coefficient C\u03c1 = hA\u2032\u2032 B \u2032\u2032 i\u03c1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 i\u03c1 hB \u2032\u2032 i\u03c1 .

Hence, depending on the\n \u0303 2\u03c1 \u2212 hZ\u0303i2\u03c1 yields the sharper upper bound. In\nsign of C\u03c1 , either hIi2\u03c1 \u2212 hZi2\u03c1 or hIi\nother words, for all separable two-qubit quantum states one has:\n\u001b\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001a\n \u0303 2\u03c1 \u2212 hZ\u0303i2\u03c1\nhIi\nhXi2\u03c1 + hY i2\u03c1\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep .\n(4.26)\n\u2264\nmin\nmax\nhIi2\u03c1 \u2212 hZi2\u03c1\nhX\u0303i2\u03c1 + h\u1ef8 i2\u03c1\nFor completeness we mention that the right hand side has an upper bound of 1/4.\nThis set of inequalities provides the announced strengthening of (4.9). This improvement pays off: in contrast to (4.9), the validity of the inequalities (4.26) for\nall orthogonal triples A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 and B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 provides a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for separability for all two-qubit states, pure or mixed. (See Appendix C\non p. 109 for a proof).\nFurthermore, (4.26) detects entanglement of the Werner states \u03c1 = (1\u2212p)| \u03c8 \u2212 ih \u03c8 \u2212 |+\np1/4 (i.e, the singlet state mixed with a fraction p of white noise) for p < 2/3. Since\nthe PPT criterion [Peres, 1996; Horodecki et al., 1996] gives the same bound and\nbecause it is necessary and sufficient for entanglement of two qubits, our criterion\n(4.26) thus detects all entangled Werner states. It furthermore detects entanglement also if the singlet state is replaced by any other maximally entangled state, a\nfeature which is not possible using linear entanglement witnesses.\nWe note that a special case of the inequalities (4.26), to wit\nhX\u0303i2\u03c1 + h\u1ef8 i2\u03c1 \u2264 hIi2\u03c1 \u2212 hZi2\u03c1\n\n(4.27)\n\n\f104\n\nChapter 4\n\nwas already found by Yu et al. [2003], by a rather different argument. These authors\nstressed that the orientation of the locally orthogonal observables play a crucial role\nin this inequality: if one chooses both triples to have a different orientation (i.e.,\nA = i[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ]/2 and B = \u2212i[B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 ]/2 or A = \u2212i[A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ]/2 and B = i[B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 ]/2)\nthe inequality (4.27) holds trivially for all quantum states \u03c1, whether entangled or\nnot. It is only when the orientation between those two triples is the same that\ninequality (4.27) can be violated by entangled quantum states.\nThe present result (4.26) complements their findings by showing that the relative\norientation of the two triples is not a crucial factor in entanglement detection.\nInstead, if the orientations are the same, both of the following inequalities contained\nin (4.26)\n \u0303 2\u03c1 \u2212 hZ\u0303i2\u03c1\nhXi2\u03c1 + hY i2\u03c1 \u2264 hIi\nhX\u0303i2\u03c1\n\n+ h\u1ef8\n\ni2\u03c1\n\n\u2264\n\nhIi2\u03c1\n\n\u2212\n\nhZi2\u03c1\n\n(4.28a)\n(4.28b)\n\nare useful tests for entanglement, while the remaining two become trivial.

Also, we discuss the problem\nof whether a finite set of triples for the inequalities (4.26) could be necessary and\nsufficient for separability.\nA well-known alternative condition for separability of two qubit states is the\nfidelity condition, which says that for all separable states the fidelity F (i.e., the\n\u221a1 (| 00i + ei\u03b1 | 11i), \u03b1 \u2208 R) is bounded as\noverlap with a Bell state | \u03c6+\n\u03b1i =\n2\n+\nF (\u03c1) := maxh \u03c6+\n\u03b1 |\u03c1| \u03c6\u03b1 i =\n\u03b1\n\n1\n1\n(\u03c11,1 + \u03c14,4 ) + |\u03c11,4 | \u2264 .\n2\n2\n\n(4.30)\n\nHere, \u03c11,1 = h 00|\u03c1| 00i, \u03c14,4 = h 11|\u03c1| 11i and \u03c11,4 denotes the extreme anti-diagonal\nelement of \u03c1, i.e., \u03c11,4 = h 00|\u03c1| 11i.

A second alternative condition, the\nLaskowski-\u017bukowski condition [Laskowski and \u017bukowski, 2005], states that separable states must obey |\u03c11,4 | \u2264 1/4.\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\n\n105\n\nHowever, choosing the Pauli matrices for both triples, i.e., (A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ) =\n(B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 ) = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) we obtain from (4.26)\n \u0303 2 \u2212 hZ\u0303i2\nhXi2 + hY i2 \u2264 hIi\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n|\u03c11,4 |2 \u2264 \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 ,\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep ,\n\n(4.32)\n\nwhich strengthens both these alternative conditions as we will now show.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nWe use the trivial inequalities that hold for every state: ( \u03c12,2 \u2212 \u03c13,3 )2 \u2265\n\u221a\n0 \u21d0\u21d2 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c13,3 and |\u03c11,4 |2 \u2264 \u03c11,1 \u03c14,4 (the latter follows from the\nA\n\nsep\n\nsemi-definiteness of every state). Let us denote by the symbols \u2264 and \u2264 inequalities\nthat either hold for all two-qubit states or for states that are separable. Then we\nobtain from (4.32) and the trivial inequalities that hold for all states that\nsep \u221a\nA\nA\n4|\u03c11,4 | \u2212 (\u03c11,1 + \u03c14,4 ) \u2264 2|\u03c11,4 | \u2264 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c13,3 .\n\n(4.33)\n\nThe strongest inequality is that between the second and third term which is (4.32).\nThis inequality implies the inequalities that use the second and fourth term and the\nfirst and fourth term, which are the fidelity condition and the Laskowski-\u017bukowski\ncondition respectively. Note that (4.33) also shows that the fidelity condition implies\nthe Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition. Lastly, using the first and third term gives a\nnew separability condition not mentioned before, but which is also weaker than\n(4.32). Violation of (4.32) is thus the strongest entanglement criterion, i.e., it will\ndetect more entangled states than these other criteria.\nAs another application, consider the following entanglement witnesses5 for so4\nB 4\ncalled local orthogonal observables (LOOs) {GA\nk }k=1 and {Gk }k=1 : a linear one\npresented by Yu and Liu [2005]:\nhWi\u03c1 = 1 \u2212\n\n4\nX\n\nk=1\n\nB\nhGA\nk \u2297 Gk i\u03c1 ,\n\n(4.34)\n\nand a nonlinear witness from G\u00fchne et al.

A typical complete set of LOOs is formed by any\northogonal triple of spin directions conjoined with \u221a\nthe identity operator, i.e., in the\n4\n4\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n2 and similarly for {GB\nnotation of this paper, {GA\n}\n=\n{1,\nA,\nA\n,\nA\n}/\nk }k=1 .\nk k=1\n5 An\n\nentanglement witness [Horodecki et al., 1996; Terhal, 1996; Lewenstein et al., 2000; Bruss et\nal., 2002] is a self-adjoint operator W that has (i) positive expectation value for all separable states,\ni.e, hW i\u03c1 \u2265 0, \u03c1 \u2208 Dsep , (ii) but that has at least one negative eigenvalue. Thus if it is the case that\nhW i\u03c1 < 0 then \u03c1 is entangled. Property (ii) ensures that every entanglement witness detects some\nentanglement, i.e., it detects the states in the eigenspace corresponding to the negative eigenvalue\nof W .\n\n\f106\n\nChapter 4\n\nThese witnesses provide tests for two-qubit entanglement in the sense that for all\nseparable two-qubit states hWi\u03c1 \u2265 0, F (\u03c1) \u2265 0 must hold and a violation of either\nof these inequalities is thus a sufficient condition for entanglement. An optimization\nprocedure for the choice of LOOs in these two witnesses is given by Zhang et al.\n[2007].\nThe strength of these two criteria has been studied for the noisy singlet state\nintroduced by G\u00fchne et al. [2006]:\n\u03c1 = p| \u03c8 \u2212 ih \u03c8 \u2212 | + (1 \u2212 p)\u03c1sep ,\n(4.36)\n\u221a\nwith | \u03c8 \u2212 i =(| 10i \u2212 | 01i)/ 2 the singlet state and the separable noise is \u03c1sep =\n(2| 00ih 00| + | 01ih 01|)/3. The Peres-Horodecki criterion [Peres, 1996; Horodecki et\nal., 1996] gives that this state \u03c1 \u221a\nis entangled for any p\u221a> 0. Under the complete set\nof LOOs {\u2212\u03c3x , \u2212\u03c3y , \u2212\u03c3z , 1}A / 2, {\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z , 1}B / 2, the linear witness given\nabove can detect the entanglement for all p > 0.4 [Zhang et al., 2007], and the\nnonlinear one detects the entanglement for p > 0.25 [G\u00fchne et al., 2006]. Using the\noptimization procedure of Zhang et al. [2007] the optimal choice of LOOs for the\nlinear witness can detect the entanglement for all p > 0.292, whereas the nonlinear\nwitness appears to be already optimal.\nUsing the same set of LOOs as above, the quadratic separability inequality (4.26)\ndetects the entanglement already for p > 0 (i.e., every entangled state is detected),\nand it is thus stronger than these two witnesses for this particular state.\nAs a final topic, we wish to point out that, in spite of the strength of the inequalities (4.26), they also have an important drawback from an experimental point of\nview as a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. In order to check their\nvalidity or violation one would have to measure for all locally orthogonal triples of\nobservables, a task which is obviously unfeasible since there are uncountably many\nof those. Because of this one must generally gather some prior knowledge about the\nstate whose entanglement is to be detected, so that one can choose settings that give\na violation. It is therefore highly interesting to ask whether a finite collection of orthogonal triples could be found for which the satisfaction of these inequalities would\nalready provide a necessary and sufficient condition for separability, since then such\nprior knowledge would no longer be necessary. Measuring the finite collection of\nsettings would then be always sufficient for entanglement detection, independent of\nthe state to be detected.\nWe have performed an (unsystematic) survey of this problem. A first natural\nattempt would be to consider the triples obtained by permutations of the basis\nvectors. Thus, consider the set of three inequalities obtained by taking for both\ntriples (A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ) and (B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 ) the choices \u03b1 = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ), \u03b2 = (\u03c3z , \u03c3y , \u03c3x ) and\n\u03b3 = (\u03c3z , \u03c3x , \u03c3y ). (Other permutations do not contribute independent inequalities.)\nUnder this choice, (4.26) leads to the six inequalities\nhXk i2\u03c1 + hYk i2\u03c1 \u2264 hI \u0303k i2\u03c1 \u2212 hZ \u0303k i2\u03c1 ,\nhX\u0303k i2\u03c1\n\n+\n\nh\u1ef8k i2\u03c1\n\n\u2264\n\nhIk i2\u03c1\n\n\u2212\n\nhZk i2\u03c1 ,\n\n(4.37a)\n(4.37b)\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\n\n107\n\nfor k = \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3.\nFor a general pure state | \u03a8i = a| 00i + b| 01i + c| 10i + d| 11i, the satisfaction of\nthese inequalities (4.37) boils down to three equations:\n2\n\n|ad| = |bc|,\n\n(4.38a)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(4.38b)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(4.38c)\n\n|(a + d) \u2212 (b + c) | = |(a \u2212 d) \u2212 (b \u2212 c) |,\n2\n\n|(b + c) + (a \u2212 d) | = |(b \u2212 c) + (a + d) |.\n\nHowever, these equations are satisfied if a = c = i, \u2212b = d = 1, i.e. for an entangled\npure state. This shows that the choice \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 above does not produce a sufficient\ncondition for separability.\nHowever, let us make an amended choice \u03b2 \u2032 : take the observables \u03b2 and apply\na rotation U for the observables of particle 1 around the y-axis over 45 degrees,\ni.e. take (A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 )\u03b2 \u2032 = (U \u03c3z U \u2020 , \u03c3y , U \u03c3x U \u2020 ) and (B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 )\u03b2 \u2032 = (\u03c3z , \u03c3y , \u03c3x ); and\n\u03b3 \u2032 : take the observables of choice \u03b3 and apply rotation U on the observables for\nparticle 1 (i.e., over 45 degrees around the y-axis) followed up by rotation V over 45\ndegrees around the z-axis on the same observables, in other words: (A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 ))\u03b3 \u2032 =\n(V U \u03c3z U \u2020 V \u2020 , V U \u03c3x U \u2020 V \u2020 , V U \u03c3y U \u2020 V \u2020 ) and (B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 )\u03b3 \u2032 = (\u03c3z , \u03c3x , \u03c3y ).\nThe choice \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2032 and \u03b3 \u2032 gives for the above arbitrary pure state | \u03a8i:\n|ad| = |bc|,\n\n|(a + c)(b \u2212 d)| = |(a \u2212 c)(b + d)|,\n\n|(a + ic)(b \u2212 id)| = |(a \u2212 ic)(b + id)|.\n\n(4.39a)\n(4.39b)\n(4.39c)\n\nA tedious but straightforward calculation shows that these equations are fulfilled\nonly if ad = bc, i.e., if | \u03a8i is separable. Hence, by measuring the observables in the\ndirections indicated by the choice \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2032 and \u03b3 \u2032 , the inequalities (4.26) do provide\na necessary and sufficient criterion for separability for pure two-qubit states. We\nhave not been able to check whether this result extends to mixed states.\n\n4.6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt has been shown that for two spin-1/2 particles (qubits) and orthogonal spin components quadratic separability inequalities hold that impose much tighter bounds\non the correlations in separable states than the traditional CHSH inequality. In\nfact, the quadratic inequalities (4.26) are so strong that their validity for all orthogonal bases is a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of all states, pure\nor mixed, and a subset of these inequalities for just three orthogonal bases (giving\nsix inequalities) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of all\npure states. Furthermore, the orientation of the measurement basis is shown to be\nirrelevant, which ensures that no shared reference frames needs to be established\nbetween the measurement apparata for each qubit.\nThe quadratic inequalities (4.26) have been shown to be stronger than both\nthe fidelity criterion and the linear and non-linear entanglement witnesses based\n\n\f108\n\nChapter 4\n\non LOOs as given by Yu and Liu [2005] and G\u00fchne et al. [2006]. Experimental\ntests for entangled states using orthogonal directions can therefore be considerably\nstrengthened by means of the quadratic inequalities (4.26). As we will discuss\nin chapter 6, these inequalities provide tests of entanglement that are much more\nrobust against noise than many alternative criteria. There we will also extend the\nanalysis to the N -qubit case by generalizing the method of section 4.4 to more than\ntwo qubits.\nFurthermore, we have argued that these quadratic Bell-type inequalities do not\nhold in LHV theories. This provides a more general example of the fact first discovered by Werner, i.e., that some entangled two-qubit states do allow an LHV reconstruction for all correlations in a standard Bell experiment. What is more, there\nappears to be a 'gap' between the correlations that can be obtained by separable two\nqubit quantum states and those obtainable by LHV models. This non-equivalence\nbetween the correlations obtainable from separable two-qubit quantum states and\nfrom LHV theories means that, apart from the question raised and answered by Bell\n(can the predictions of quantum mechanics be reproduced by an LHV theory?) it is\nalso interesting to ask whether separable two-qubit quantum states can reproduce\nthe predictions of an LHV theory. The answer, as we have seen, is negative: quantum theory generally needs entangled two-qubit states even in order to reproduce\nthe classical correlations of such an LHV theory. In fact, as we will show in chapter\n6, the gap between the correlations allowed for by local hidden-variable theories and\nthose achievable by separable qubit states increases exponentially with the number\nof particles.\n\nAppendices\nAppendix A - Here we prove that any pure two-qubit state satisfying (4.9), for\nall sets of local orthogonal observables, must be separable. By the bi-orthogonal\ndecomposition theorem, and following Gisin [1991], any pure state can be written in the form | \u03a8i = r| 10i \u2212 s| 01i, with r, s \u2265 0, r2 + s2 = 1. For this\nstate ha * \u03c3 \u2297 b * \u03c3i\u03a8 = \u2212az bz \u2212 2rs (ax bx + ay by ), etc. Using this and choosing a = (0, 0, 1), a\u2032 = (1, 0, 0) and b = (sin \u03b2, 0, cos \u03b2), b\u2032 = (\u2212 cos \u03b2, 0, sin \u03b2)\nwe obtain hAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2 + hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2 = (1 + 2rs)2 . This is the maximum value\nthat can be obtained for any set of locally orthogonal observables. If (4.9) holds,\nthis expression is smaller than or equal to 1, and it follows that rs = 0, i.e., the\nstate | \u03a8i is not entangled.\nAppendix B - Here we provide further examples of entangled states that satisfy\nthe CHSH inequalities (4.2) for all observables in the standard Bell experiment.\nFirst note [Horodecki et al., 1995] that any two-qubit state can be written in the\nP3\nform \u03c1 = 41 (1 \u2297 1 + r * \u03c3 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 s * \u03c3 + ij=1 tij \u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j ), where r = Tr \u03c1(\u03c3 \u2297 1),\ns = Tr \u03c1(1\u2297\u03c3) and tij = Tr \u03c1(\u03c3i \u2297\u03c3j ). By employing the freedom of choosing local\ncoordinate frames at both sites separately, we can bring the matrix (tij ) to diago-\n\n\fStrengthened CHSH separability inequalities\n\n109\n\nnal form [Horodecki and Horodecki, 1996b], i.e., t = diag (t11 , t22 , t33 ), and arrange\nthat tii \u2265 0. Furthermore, since the labeling of the coordinate axes is arbitrary, we\ncan also pick an ordering such that t11 \u2265 t22 \u2265 t33 .\nNow let \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 denote two pairs of arbitrary spin observables, for particle\n1 and 2 respectively, \u03b1 = \u03b1 * \u03c3 \u2297 1, \u03b2 = 1 \u2297 \u03b2 * \u03c3 and similar for the primed\nobservables. It is easy to see that the maximum of |h\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b1\u03b2 \u2032 + \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2 \u2032 i\u03c1 | for all\nchoices of observables will be attained by taking the vectors \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 coplanar\n6\n, and in fact, in the plane spanned by the two eigenvectors of t with the largest\neigenvalues, i.e., t11 and t22 . As shown by p\nHorodecki et al. [1995], this maximum is\nmax\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032 ,\u03b2 \u2032 |h\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b1\u03b2 \u2032 + \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b2 \u2032 i\u03c1 | = 2 t211 + t222 . Thus \u03c1 will satisfy all CHSH\ninequalities if t211 + t222 \u2264 1, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the\nexistence of an LHV model [\u017bukowski and Brukner, 2002].\nNow consider the maximum of hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2\u03c1 + hAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2\u03c1 , with A \u22a5 A\u2032\nand B \u22a5 B \u2032 . Clearly, these spin observables should be chosen in the same plane\nas before, spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to t11 and t22 . As mentioned in the text, the expression is invariant under rotations of A, A\u2032 or B, B \u2032 in\nthis plane. Choosing A = B = \u03c3x , A\u2032 = \u2212B \u2032 = \u03c3y the maximum is equal to\nmaxA\u22a5A\u2032 ,B\u22a5B \u2032 hAB \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 i2 + hAB \u2032 + A\u2032 Bi2 = (t11 + t22 )2 . Clearly, state \u03c1 will be\nboth entangled and satisfy all CHSH inequalities for all observables (and thus have\nan LHV description) if t11 + t22 > 1 and t211 + t222 \u2264 1.\nAppendix C - Here we will prove that any state \u03c1 that satisfies the inequalities\n(4.26) for all orthogonal triples A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 , and B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 must be separable (the\nconverse has already been proven above).\nWe proceed from the well-known Peres-Horodecki lemma [Peres, 1996; Horodecki\net al., 1996] that a state of two qubits is separable iff \u03c1PT \u2265 0 where 'PT' denotes\npartial transposition. Equivalently, the state is entangled iff, for all pure states | \u03a8i:\nh \u03a8|\u03c1PT | \u03a8i = Tr \u03c1PT | \u03a8ih \u03a8| = Tr \u03c1(| \u03a8ih \u03a8|)P T \u2265 0.\n\n(4.40)\n\nWe shall show that (4.40) holds whenever \u03c1 obeys (4.27). Indeed, according to the\nbi-orthonormal decomposition theorem (cf. Gisin [1991]), we can find bases | 0i, | 1i\n\u221a\n\u221a\non H1 and | 0i, | 1i on H2 such that | \u03c8i = p| 01i + 1 \u2212 p| 10i. Choosing these\nbases to be the eigenvectors of A\u2032\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 respectively, we thus find\np\n1\n1\n| \u03a8ih \u03a8| = I \u0303 + (p \u2212 )Z\u0303 + p(1 \u2212 p)X\u0303,\n2\n2\np\n1\n1 \u0303\nPT\n| \u03a8ih \u03a8|\n= I + (p \u2212 )Z\u0303 + p(1 \u2212 p)X.\n(4.41)\n2\n2\nHence\np\n1\n1  \u0303\n+ (p \u2212 )hZ\u0303i + p(1 \u2212 p)hXi,\n(4.42)\nh \u03a8|\u03c1P T | \u03a8i = hIi\n2\n2\n\n6 Here 'coplanar' refers to a single plane in the local frames of reference.

In the case\nof qubits such a choice amounts to choosing anti-commuting observables. In this\nchapter we relax this condition of anti-commutation of the local observables and\nstudy the bound on the CHSH inequality for the full spectrum of non-commuting\nobservables, i.e., ranging from commuting to anti-commuting observables. We provide analytic expressions for the bounds for both entangled and separable qubit\nstates.\nThe CHSH inequality is satisfied for every separable quantum state, but may be\nviolated by any pure entangled state [Gisin and Peres, 1992; Gisin, 1991; Popescu\nand Rohrlich, 1992a]. It is well-known that in order to achieve such a violation\none must make measurements of pairs of non-commuting spin-observables for both\nparticles, which we can take to be qubits. It is also well-known (thanks to the work\nof Tsirelson [1980]) that in order to achieve the maximum violation allowed for by\nquantum theory, one must choose both pairs of these local observables to be anticommuting. It is tempting to introduce a quantitative 'degree of commutativity'\nby means of the angle between two spin-observables: if their angle is zero, the\nobservables commute; if their angle is \u03c0/2 they anti-commute, which may thought\nof as the extreme case of non-commutativity. Thus one may expect that there\nis a trade-off relation between the degrees of local commutativity and the degree\nof CHSH inequality violation, in the sense that if both local angles increase from\n0 towards \u03c0/2 (i.e., the degree of local commutativity decreases), the maximum\n\n\f112\n\nChapter 5\n\nviolation of the CHSH inequality increases. It is one of the purposes of this chapter\nto provide a quantitative tight expression of this relation for arbitrary angles.\nIt is less well-known that there is also a converse trade-off relation for separable\ntwo-qubit states. For these states, the bound implied by the CHSH inequality may\nbe reached, but only if at least one of the pairs of local observables commute, i.e., if\nat least one of the angles is zero. It was shown in the previous chapter that if both\npairs anti-commute (i.e, are locally orthogonal), such states can only reach a bound\nwhich\nis considerably smaller than the bound set by the CHSH inequality, namely\n\u221a\n2 instead of 2. Thus, for separable two-qubit states there appears to be a trade-off\nbetween local commutativity and CHSH inequality non-violation. The quantitative\nexpression of this separability inequality was already investigated by Roy [2005] for\nthe special case when the local angles between the spin observables are equal. It\nis a second purpose of this chapter to report an improvement of this result and\nextend it to the general case of unequal angles. As in the case of entangled states\nmentioned above, the quantitative expression reported will be tight.\nApart from the purely theoretical interest of these two trade-off relations, we will\nshow that the last one also has experimental relevance. This latter trade-off relation\nis a separability condition, i.e., it must be obeyed by all separable two-qubit states,\nand consequently, a violation of this trade-off relation is a sufficient condition for the\npresence of two-qubit entanglement. Indeed, this separability condition is strictly\nstronger as a test for entanglement than the ordinary CHSH inequality whenever\nboth pairs of local observables are non-commuting (i.e., for non-parallel settings).\nFurthermore, since the relation is linear in the state \u03c1 it can be easily formulated\nas an entanglement witness [Horodecki et al., 1996; Terhal, 1996; Lewenstein et al.,\n2000; Bruss et al., 2002] for two qubits in terms of locally measurable observables\n[G\u00fchne et al., 2003, 2002]. It has the advantage, not shared by ordinary entanglement witnesses [Horodecki et al., 1996; Terhal, 1996; Lewenstein et al., 2000;\nBruss et al., 2002; G\u00fchne et al., 2006; Yu and Liu, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007; G\u00fchne\net al., 2003, 2002], that it is not necessary that one has exact knowledge about the\nobservables one is implementing in the experimental procedure. Thus, even in the\npresence of some uncertainty about the observables measured, the trade-off relation\nof this chapter allows one to use an explicit entanglement criterion nevertheless.\nThe structure of this chapter is as follows. Before presenting the trade-off relations in section 5.3 we will review some requisite background in section 5.2. In\nsection 5.4 we will discuss the import of the relations obtained.\n\n5.2\n\nCHSH inequality and local commutativity\n\nConsider again a bi-partite quantum system in the familiar setting of a standard\nBell experiment. Let us further recall the CHSH operator\nB := A(B + B \u2032 ) + A\u2032 (B \u2212 B \u2032 ),\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fLocal commutativity and CHSH inequality violation\n\n113\n\nand that in order to obtain the quantum bounds of hBi\u03c1 it suffices to consider only\nP\nqubits and the usual traceless spin observables, e.g. A = a * \u03c3 =\ni ai \u03c3i , with\nkak = 1, i = x, y, z and \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z the familiar Pauli spin operators on H = C2 .\nIn the previous chapter the bounds on the CHSH operator that hold for separable\nand entangled states have been shown. For convenience they will be repeated here.\nFor the set Dsep of all separable states the bound is\n|hBi\u03c1 | \u2264 2.\n\n(5.2)\n\nHowever, for the set D of all (possibly entangled) quantum states Tsirelson [1980]\n(cf. Landau [1987]) showed that\nq\n(5.3)\n|hBi\u03c1 | \u2264 4 + |h[A, A\u2032 ] \u2297 [B, B \u2032 ]i\u03c1 | ,\n\n\u221a\nwhich, has a numerical upper bound of 2 2 (cf. (4.3)).\n\n5.2.1\n\nMaximal violation requires local anti-commutativity\n\nThe Tsirelson inequality (5.3) tells us that the only way to get a violation of the\nCHSH inequality (5.2) is when both pairs of local observables are non-commuting:\nIf one of the two commutators in (5.3) is zero there will be no violation of (5.2).\nFurthermore, we see from\n\u221a (5.3) that in order to maximally violate inequality (5.2)\n(i.e., to get |hBi\u03c1 | = 2 2) the following condition must hold [Tsirelson, 1980; Toner\nand Verstraete, 2006]:\n|h[A, A\u2032 ] \u2297 [B, B \u2032 ]i\u03c1 | = 4.\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe local observables i[A, A\u2032 ]/2 and i[B, B \u2032 ]/2 (which are both dichotomous and\nhave their spectra within [\u22121, 1]) must thus be maximally correlated.\nHowever, the condition (5.4) is only necessary for a maximal violation, but not\nsufficient. Separable states are also able to obey this condition while such states\nnever violate the CHSH inequality. For example, choose A = B = \u03c3y , A\u2032 = B \u2032 = \u03c3x .\nThis gives [A, A\u2032 ] \u2297 [B, B \u2032 ] = \u22124\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z . The condition (5.4) is then satisfied in the\nseparable two-qubit state (| 00ih 00| + | 11ih 11|)/2 in the z-basis.\nNevertheless, we can infer from (5.4) that for maximal violation the local observables must anti-commute, i.e., {A, A\u2032 } = {B, B \u2032 } = 0 (a result already obtained in a different way by Popescu and Rohrlich [1992b]). To see this, consider\nlocal qubit observables, which are not necessarily anti-commuting and note that\ni[A, A\u2032 ]/2 = \u2212(a \u00d7 a\u2032 ) * \u03c3 and analogously i[B, B]/2 = \u2212(b \u00d7 b\u2032 ) * \u03c3. We thus get\n|h[A, A\u2032 ] \u2297 [B \u2032 , B]i\u03c1 | = 4|h(a \u00d7 a\u2032 ) * \u03c3 \u2297 (b \u00d7 b\u2032 ) * \u03c3i\u03c1 |.\n\n(5.5)\n\nThis can equal 4 only if || a \u00d7 a\u2032 || = || b \u00d7 b\u2032 || = 1, which implies that a * a\u2032 = 0\nand b * b\u2032 = 0, since a, a\u2032 , b and b\u2032 are unit vectors.\nIf we denote by \u03b8A the angle between observables A and A\u2032 (i.e., cos \u03b8A = a * a\u2032)\nand analogously for \u03b8B , we see that the local observables must thus be orthogonal:\n\n\f114\n\nChapter 5\n\n\u03b8A = \u03b8B = \u03c0/2 (mod \u03c0), or equivalently, they must anti-commute. Thus the\ncondition (5.4) implies that we need locally anti-commuting observables to obtain\na maximal violation of the CHSH inequality.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, local commutativity (i.e., [A, A\u2032 ] = [B, B \u2032 ] =\n0) corresponds to the observables being parallel or anti-parallel, i.e., \u03b8A = \u03b8B = 0\n(mod. \u03c0), and local anti-commutativity (i.e., {A, A\u2032 } = {B, B \u2032 } = 0) corresponds to\nthe observables being orthogonal, i.e., \u03b8A , \u03b8B = \u00b1\u03c0/2. Therefore, in order to obtain\nany violation at all it is necessary that the local observables are at some angle to\neach other, i.e., \u03b8A 6= 0, \u03b8B 6= 0, whereas maximal violation is only possible if the\nlocal observables are orthogonal.\nThis suggests that there exists a quantitative trade-off relation that expresses\nexactly how the amount of violation depends on the local angles \u03b8A , \u03b8B between\nthe spin observables. In other words, we are interested in determining the form of\nC(\u03b8A , \u03b8B ) := max |hBi\u03c1 |\n\u03c1\u2208D\n\n(5.6)\n\nIn the next section we will present such a relation.\nHowever, before doing so, we continue our review for the case of separable twoqubit states. In this case, a more stringent bound on the expectation value of the\nCHSH operator is obtained than the usual bound of 2.\n\n5.2.2\n\nLocal anti-commutativity and separable states\n\nUsing the quadratic separability inequality (4.24) of the previous chapter for anticommuting observables ({A, A\u2032 } = {B, B \u2032 } = 0), the identity (4.11) and the definitions of (4.21) we get for all two-qubit states in Dsep :\nhBi2\u03c1 + hB \u2032 i2\u03c1 \u2264 2[h1 \u2297 1 \u2212 A\u2032\u2032 \u2297 B \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 \u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 B \u2032\u2032 i2\u03c1 ],\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere B \u2032 is the same as B but with the local observables interchanged (i.e., A \u2194 A\u2032\n, B \u2194 B \u2032 ), and where we have also used the shorthand notation A\u2032\u2032 = i[A, A\u2032 ]/2\nand B \u2032\u2032 = i[B, B \u2032 ]/2. Note that the triple A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 are mutually anti-commuting\nand can thus be easily extended to form a set of local orthogonal observables for\nC2 (so-called LOO's [G\u00fchne et al., 2006; Yu and Liu, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007]).\nThe separability inequality (5.7) provides a very strong entanglement criterion,\nas was shown in the previous chapter, but it is here used to derive a (weaker)\nseparability inequality in terms of the Bell operator B for all two-qubit states in\nDsep :\nr\n1\n1\n(5.8)\n|hBi\u03c1 | \u2264 2(1 \u2212 |h[A, A\u2032 ]i\u03c11 |2 )(1 \u2212 |h[B, B \u2032 ]i\u03c12 |2 ).\n4\n4\nHere \u03c11 and \u03c12 are the reduced single qubit states that are obtained from \u03c1 by partial tracing over the other qubit. The inequality (5.8) is the separability analogue\nfor anti-commuting observables of the Tsirelson inequality (5.3). Note that even in\n\n\fLocal commutativity and CHSH inequality violation\n\n115\n\n\u221a\nthe weakest case (h[A, A\u2032 ]i\u03c11 = h[B, B]i\u03c12 = 0) it implies |hBi\u03c1 | \u2264 2, which is the\nstrengthening of the original CHSH inequality (5.2) already shown in the previous\nchapter. Thus, for separable states, a reversed effect of the requirement of local\nanti-commutativity appears than for entangled quantum states. Indeed, for locally\nanti-commuting observables we deduce from (5.8) that the maximum value of hBi\u03c1\nis considerably less than the maximum value of 2 attainable using commuting observables. In contrast to entangled states, the requirement of anti-commutativity,\nwhich, as we have seen, is equivalent to local orthogonality of the spin observables, thus decreases the maximum expectation value of the CHSH operator B for\nseparable two-qubit states.\nAn interesting question is now: what happens to the maximum attainable by\nseparable two-qubit states for locally non-commuting observables that are not precisely anti-commuting? Or put equivalently, how does this bound depend on the\nangles between the local spin observables when the observables are neither parallel\nnor orthogonal? From the above one would expect the bound to drop below the\nstandard bound of 2 as soon as the settings are not parallel or anti-parallel. Just\nas in the case of general quantum states it would thus be interesting to get a quantitative trade-off relation that expresses exactly how the maximum bound for hBi\u03c1\ndepends on the local angles of the spin observables. In other words, we need to\nestablish\nD(\u03b8A , \u03b8B ) := max |hBi\u03c1 |,\n\u03c1\u2208Dsep\n\n(5.9)\n\nfrom which we obtain the separability inequality\n|hBi\u03c1 | \u2264 D(\u03b8A , \u03b8B ),\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 Dsep .\n\n(5.10)\n\nIn the following we present such a tight trade-off relation.\n\n5.3\n\nTrade-off relations\n\n5.3.1\n\nGeneral qubit states\n\nIt was already pointed out by Landau [1987] that inequality (5.3) is tight, i.e., for\nall choices of the observables, there exists a two-qubit state \u03c1 such that :\nq\nmax |hB\u03c1 i| = 4 + |h[A, A\u2032 ] \u2297 [B \u2032 , B]i\u03c1 |.\n(5.11)\n\u03c1\u2208D\n\nThis maximum is invariant under local unitary transformations U \u2297U \u2032, since Tr[(U \u2297\nU \u2032 )\u2020 B(U \u2297 U \u2032 )\u03c1] = Tr[B \u03c1\u0303] with \u03c1\u0303 = (U \u2297 U \u2032 )\u03c1(U \u2297 U \u2032 )\u2020 . This invariance amounts\nto a freedom in the choice of the local reference frames.\nHence, without loss of generality, we can choose\na = (1, 0, 0), a\u2032 = (cos \u03b8A , sin \u03b8A , 0),\nb = (1, 0, 0), b\u2032 = (cos \u03b8B , sin \u03b8B , 0).\n\n(5.12)\n\n\f116\n\nChapter 5\n\nThis choice gives i[A, A\u2032 ]/2 = \u2212 sin \u03b8A \u03c3z and, analogously, i[B, B \u2032 ]/2 = \u2212 sin \u03b8B \u03c3z .\nHence, we immediately obtain\nq\n(5.13)\nmax |hB\u03c1 i| = 4 + 4| sin \u03b8A sin \u03b8B h\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z i\u03c1 |.\n\u03c1\u2208D\n\nTo obtain a state independent bound, it remains to be shown that we can choose \u03c1\nsuch that |h\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z i\u03c1 | = 1 in order to conclude that\np\n(5.14)\nC(\u03b8A , \u03b8B ) = 4 + 4| sin \u03b8A sin \u03b8B |.\nTo see that (5.14) holds, note that the CHSH operator for the above choice\n(5.12) of observables becomes:\nB = \u03b1| 00ih 11| + \u03b2| 01ih 10| + \u03b1\u2217 | 10ih 01| + \u03b2 \u2217 | 11ih 00|,\n\n(5.15)\n\n\u03b1 = 1 + e\u2212i\u03b8A + e\u2212i\u03b8B \u2212 e\u2212i(\u03b8A +\u03b8B ) ,\n\n(5.16)\n\nwith\n\n\u03b2 =1+e\n\n\u2212i\u03b8A\n\n+e\n\ni\u03b8B\n\n\u2212e\n\n\u2212i(\u03b8A \u2212\u03b8B )\n\n.\n\n(5.17)\n\nWe distinguish two cases: (i) when sin \u03b8A sin \u03b8B \u2265 0 (i.e. when 0 \u2264 \u03b8A , \u03b8B \u2264 \u03c0 or\n\u221a1 (| 00i + ei\u03c4 | 11i).

Therefore, to find max\u03c1\u2208Dsep |hBi\u03c1 |, we may consider the same choice\nof observables as before in (5.12) without loss of generality. Further, we only\nhave to consider pure states and can take the state | \u03a8i = | \u03c81 i| \u03c82 i with | \u03c81 i =\ncos \u03b31 e\u2212i\u03c61 /2 | 0i + sin \u03b31 ei\u03c61 /2 | 1i and | \u03c82 i = cos \u03b32 e\u2212i\u03c62 /2 | 0i + sin \u03b32 ei\u03c62 /2 | 1i.

Firstly, between the degrees of local commutativity, as measured by the local\nangles \u03b8A and \u03b8B , and the maximal degree of CHSH inequality violation, in the\nsense that if both local angles increase towards \u03c0/2 (i.e., the degree of local commutativity decreases), the maximum violation of the CHSH inequality increases.\nSecondly, a converse trade-off relation holds for separable two-qubit states: if both\nlocal angles increase towards \u03c0/2, the value attainable for the expectation of the\nCHSH operator decreases and thus the non-violation of the CHSH inequality increases. The extreme cases of these relations are obtained for anti-commuting local\n\n\fLocal commutativity and CHSH inequality violation\n\n119\n\n\u221a\n2 2\nC(\u03b8, \u03b8)\n\n2\n\nD(\u03b8, \u03b8)\n\u221a\n2\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nFigure 5.3: Plot of the results (5.20) (dashed line) and (5.25) (uninterrupted line), and of\nthe bound by Roy [2005] given in (5.26) (dotted line).\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nobservables where the bounds of 2 2 and 2 hold, which reproduces these results of\nthe previous chapter. For the case of equal angles the trade-off relation for separable\nstates strengthens a previous result of Roy [2005].\nOur results are complementary to the well studied question what the maximum\nof the expectation value of the CHSH operator is when evaluated in a certain state\n(see e.g., [Gisin and Peres, 1992; Gisin, 1991; Popescu and Rohrlich, 1992a]). Here\nwe have not focused on a certain given state, but instead on the observables chosen,\ni.e., we asked, independent of the specific state of the system, what the maximum of\nthe expectation value of the CHSH operator is when using certain local observables.\nThe answer found shows a diverging trade-off relation for the two classes of separable\nand non-separable two-qubit states.\nIndeed, these two trade-off relations show that local non-commutativity has\ntwo diametrically opposed features: On the one hand, the choice of locally noncommuting observables is necessary to allow for any violation of the CHSH inequality in entangled states (a \"more than classical\" result). On the other hand, this very\nsame choice of non-commuting observables implies a \"less than classical\" result for\nseparable two-qubit states: For such states the correlations (in terms of hBi\u03c1 ) obey\na more stringent bound than allowed for by local hidden-variable theories, cf. the\nCHSH inequality (5.2).\nThese trade-off relations are useful for experiments aiming to detect entangled\nstates. They have an experimental advantage above both Bell-type inequalities and\nentanglement witnesses as tests for two-qubit entanglement. This will be discussed\nnext.\nFor comparison to the CHSH inequality as a test of entanglement, let us define the 'violation factor' X as the ratio C(\u03b8A , \u03b8B )/D(\u03b8A , \u03b8B ), i.e. the maximum\n\n\f120\n\nChapter 5\n\n2\nX\n\n\u221a\n2\nXCHSH\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nFigure 5.4: Violation factor X (uninterrupted line) and XCHSH (dashed line) for \u03b8A =\n\u03b8B := \u03b8.\n\ncorrelation attained by entangled states divided by the maximum correlation attainable for separable states. In Figure (5.4) we have plotted this violation factor\nX for the special case of equal angles, cf. (5.20) and (5.25) and compared it to the\nratio by which these maximal correlations violate the CHSH inequality (5.2), i.e.\nXCHSH := C(\u03b8, \u03b8)/2. Figure 5.4 shows that the violation factor X is always higher\nthan XCHSH except when \u03b8 = 0. For angles \u03b8 \u221a\n. \u03c0/4 these two factors differ only\nslightly, but the violation factor X increases to 2 times the original factor XCHSH\nwhen \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2. Furthermore note that the factor X increases more and\nmore steeply, whereas XCHSH increases less and less steeply. For the case of unequal\nangles the same features occur, as is evident from comparing Figures 5.1 and 5.2.\nTherefore, the comparison of the correlation in entangled qubit states to the\nmaximum correlation obtainable in separable states yields a stronger test for entanglement than violations\nof the CHSH inequality. Indeed, the violation factor may\n\u221a\nreach 2 instead of 2. This means that the separability inequality (5.10) detects\nmore entangled states and tolerates greater noise robustness in detecting entanglement (cf. section 4.5). Clearly, the optimal case of this relation obtains when the\nlocal observables are exactly orthogonal to each other. On the other hand, in the\ncase where at least one of the local pairs of observables are parallel, no improvement\nupon the CHSH inequality is obtained. But that case is trivial, i.e., no entangled\nstate can violate either (5.2) or (5.10) in that case.\nOther criteria for the detection of qubit entanglement than the CHSH inequality\nhave been developed in the form of entanglement witnesses. In general, these criteria\nhave two experimental drawbacks1: (i) they are usually designed for the detection\nof a particular entangled state and hence require some a priori knowledge about the\nstate, and (ii) they require the implementation of a specific set of local observables\n1 See also [van Enk et al., 2007] where the assumptions needed in various entanglement verification procedures are extensively discussed.\n\n\fLocal commutativity and CHSH inequality violation\n\n121\n\n(e.g., locally orthogonal ones [G\u00fchne et al., 2006; Yu and Liu, 2005; Zhang et al.,\n2007]). The separability inequality (5.10) compares favorably on these two points,\nas we will discuss next.\nIn real experimental situations one might not be completely sure about which\nobservables are being measured. For example, one might not be sure that the local\nangles are exactly orthogonal in the optimal setup. However, even in such cases,\none might be reasonably sure that the angles are close to 90 degrees, e.g., that\nthese angles certainly lie within some finite-sized interval \u01eb around 90 degrees. In\nthat case, the bound\n\u221a (5.10) for separable states would of course be higher than the\noptimal value of 2 and the increase depends on the size of the interval specified.\nBut the trade-off relation presented in this letter tells us exactly how much higher\nthe bound becomes as a function of the angles (e.g., \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 \u00b1 \u01eb), so one can still\nobtain a relevant bound on |hBi|. One can thus still use it as a criterion for testing\nentanglement in the presence of some ignorance about the measured observables.\nEntanglement witnesses do not share this feature since no other trade-off relations\nhave been obtained (at least to our knowledge) that quantify how the performance\nof the witness is changed when one allows for uncertainty in the observables that\nfeature in the witness.\nNote that for two qubits this result answers the question raised by Nagata et\nal. [2002a] where it was asked how separability inequalities for orthogonal observables could allow for some uncertainty \u01eb in the orthogonality, i.e., allowing for\n|{A, A\u2032 }| \u2264 \u01eb (analogous for B, B \u2032 ). A further advantage of the separability inequalities (5.10) is that they are not state-dependent and are formulated in terms\nof locally measurable observables from the start, whereas it is usually the case (apart\nfrom a few simple cases) that constructions of entanglement witnesses involve some\nextremization procedure and are state-dependent. Furthermore, finding the decomposition of witnesses in terms of a few locally measurable observables is not always\neasy [G\u00fchne et al., 2003, 2002]. However, it must be said that choosing the optimal\nset of observables in the separability inequalities for detecting a specific state of\ncourse also requires some prior knowledge of this state.\nThe results presented here only concern the case of two qubits2 and the bipartite linear Bell-type inequality. It might prove useful to look for similar trade-off\nrelations for nonlinear separability inequalities as well as for entanglement witnesses.\nFurthermore, it would be interesting to extend this analysis to the multi-partite\nBell-type inequalities involving two dichotomous observables per party such as the\nWerner-Wolff-\u017bukowski-Brukner inequalities [Werner and Wolf, 2001; \u017bukowski and\nBrukner, 2002] or the Mermin-type inequalities [Mermin, 1990]. For the latter the\nsituation for local anti-commutativity has already been investigated [Roy, 2005;\nNagata et al., 2002a; Seevinck and Uffink, 2008], but for non-commuting observables\nthat are not anti-commuting no results have yet been obtained.\n2 For the case of quantum systems that have a larger Hilbert space than C2 as their state space,\nsee the discussion at the end of section 4.3 that deals with the question of what happens to the\ntrade-off relation for separable states in that case.\n\n\f\fIII\n\nMulti-partite correlations\n\n\f\fChapter 6\n\n125\n\nPartial separability and\nentanglement criteria for\nmulti-qubit quantum states\nThis chapter is largely based on (i) Seevinck and Uffink [2008], (ii) T\u00f3th, G\u00fchne,\nSeevinck and Uffink [2005], and (iii) Seevinck and Uffink [2001].\n\n6.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe problem of characterizing entanglement for multi-partite quantum systems has\nrecently drawn much attention. An important issue in this study is that, apart\nfrom the extreme cases of full separability and full entanglement of all particles in\nthe system, one also has to face the intermediate situations in which only some\nsubsets of particles are entangled and others not. The latter states are usually\ncalled 'partially separable with respect to a specific partition' or, more precisely,\nk-separable with respect to a specific partition if the N -partite system is separable\ninto a specific partition of k subsystems (k \u2264 N ) [D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2000, 2001; D\u00fcr\net al., 1999; D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2001; Nagata et al., 2002a] . The partial separability\nstructure of multi-qubit states has been classified by D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001].\nThis classification consists of a hierarchy of levels corresponding to the k-separable\nstates for k = 1, . . . N , and within each level different classes are distinguished\nby specifying under which partitions of the system the state is k-separable or kinseparable. As we shall argue, however, it is useful to extend this classification\nwith one more class at each level k, since the notion of k-separability with respect\nto a specific partition does not exhaust all partial separability properties.\nSeveral experimentally accessible conditions to characterize k-separable multiqubit states have already been proposed, e.g., Bell-type inequalities [Laskowski\nand \u017bukowski, 2005; Nagata et al., 2002a; Roy, 2005; Uffink, 2002; Seevinck and\n\n\f126\n\nChapter 6\n\nSvetlichny, 2002; Collins et al., 2002; Gisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci, 1998] and,\nmore generally, in terms of entanglement witnesses [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a]. However, these conditions address only part of the full classification since they do not\ndistinguish between the various classes within a level. Here we derive separability\nconditions that do address the full classification of partial separability. This will be\nperformed by generalizing the derivation of the two-qubit separability conditions of\nchapter 4 to the multi-qubit setting.\nThese new conditions take the form of inequalities that provide bounds on experimentally accessible correlations for the standard Bell-type experiments (involving\nat each site measurement of two dichotomic observables). These inequalities form a\nhierarchy with strong state-dependent bounds and numerical bounds that decrease\nby a factor of four for each level in the partial separability hierarchy. For the classes\nwithin a given level, the inequalities give state-dependent bounds, differing for each\nclass. Violations of the inequalities provide strong sufficient criteria for various\nforms of non-separability and multi-qubit entanglement.\nWe next demonstrate the strength of these conditions in two ways: Firstly,\nby showing that they imply several other general experimentally accessible entanglement criteria, namely the fidelity criterion [Sackett et al., 2000; Seevinck and\nUffink, 2001; Zeng et al., 2003], the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition [Laskowski and\n\u017bukowski, 2005] (with a strict improvement for k = 2, N ), and the D\u00fcr-Cirac criterion [D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2000, 2001]. The first two are conditions for separability in\ngeneral and the third is a condition for separability under specific partitions. We\nfurthermore show that the new conditions imply the Mermin-type separability inequalities of [Nagata et al., 2002a; Roy, 2005; Uffink, 2002; Seevinck and Svetlichny,\n2002; Collins et al., 2002; Gisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci, 1998]. We also show\nthat the latter are equivalent to the Laskowski-\u017bukowski separability condition.\nSecondly, we compare the conditions to other state-specific multi-qubit entanglement criteria [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a; G\u00fchne et al., 2007; Chen and Chen, 2007]\nboth for their white noise robustness and for the number of measurement settings\nrequired in their implementation. In particular, we show (i) detection of bound\nentanglement for N \u2265 3 with noise robustness for detecting the bound entangled\nstates of D\u00fcr and Cirac [2001] that goes to 1 for large N (i.e., maximal noise robustness), (ii) detection of the four qubit Dicke state with noise robustness 0.84 and\n0.36 for detecting it as entangled and fully entangled respectively, (iii) great noise\nand decoherence robustness [Cabello et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2006] in detecting entanglement of the N -qubit GHZ state where for colored noise and for decoherence\ndue to dephasing the robustness for detecting full entanglement goes to 1 for large\nN , and lastly, (iv) better white noise robustness than the stabilizer witness criteria\nof T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne [2005a] for detecting the N -qubit GHZ states. In all these cases\nit is shown that only N + 1 settings are needed.\nChoosing the familiar Pauli matrices as the local orthogonal observables yields a\nconvenient matrix element representation of the partial separability conditions. In\nthis representation, the inequalities give specific bounds on the anti-diagonal matrix\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n127\n\nelements in terms of the diagonal ones. Further, some comments will be made along\nthe way on how these results relate to the original purpose [Bell, 1964] of Bell-type\ninequalities to test local hidden-variable models against quantum mechanics. Most\nnotably, when the number of parties is increased, there is not only an exponentially\nincreasing factor that separates the correlations allowed in maximally entangled\nstates in comparison to those of local hidden-variable theories, but, surprisingly,\nalso an exponentially increasing factor between the correlations allowed by LHV\nmodels and those allowed by non-entangled qubit states.\nThis chapter is structured as follows. In section 6.2 we define the relevant partial separability notions and extend the hierarchic partial separability classification\nof D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001]. There we also introduce the notions of k-separable\nentanglement and of m-partite entanglement. Using these notions we investigate\nthe relation between partial separability and multi-partite entanglement and show\nit to be non-trivial. The four experimentally accessible partial separability conditions are presented that are to be strengthened in the next section. In section\n6.3 we derive the announced partial separability criteria for N qubits in terms of\nexperimentally accessible quantities. They provide the desired necessary conditions\nfor the full hierarchic separability classification. From these we obtain the sufficient\nnon-separability and entanglement criteria. In section 6.4 the experimental strength\nof these criteria is discussed. We end in section 6.5 with a discussion of the results\nobtained.\n\n6.2\n\nPartial separability and multi-partite\nentanglement\n\nIn this section we introduce terminology and definitions to be used in later sections.\nWe define the notions of k-separability, \u03b1k -separability, k-separable entanglement\nand m-partite entanglement and use these notions to capture aspects of the separability and entanglement structure in multi-partite states. We review the separability\nhierarchy introduced by D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001] and extend their classification.\nWe also discuss four partial separability conditions known in the literature These\nconditions will be strengthened in 6.3.\n\n6.2.1\n\nPartial separability and the separability hierarchy\n\nConsider an N -qubit system1 with Hilbert space H = C2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 C2 . Let \u03b1k =\n(S1 , . . . , Sk ) denote a partition of {1, . . . , N } into k disjoint nonempty subsets\n(k \u2264 N ). Such a partition corresponds to a division of the system into k distinct\nsubsystems, also called a k-partite split [D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2000]. A quantum state \u03c1\n1 The\n\ndefinitions and results of this subsection are not limited to qubits only. The dimension\nof the Hilbert space can be any finite number. However, since we restrict ourselves in all other\nsections to qubits we adopt qubits in this section too.\n\n\f128\n\nChapter 6\n\nof this N -qubit system is k-separable under a specific k-partite split \u03b1k [D\u00fcr and\nCirac, 2000, 2001; D\u00fcr et al., 1999; D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2001; Nagata et al., 2002a] iff it\nis fully separable in terms of the k subsystems in this split, i.e., iff\nX\nX\npi = 1,\n(6.1)\npi \u2265 0,\npi \u2297kn=1 \u03c1Si n ,\n\u03c1=\ni\n\ni\n\nSn\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a state of the subsystem corresponding to Sn in the split \u03b1k . We denote\n\u03b1k\n\u03b1k\nsuch states as \u03c1 \u2208 DN\nand also call them \u03b1k -separable, for short. Clearly, DN\nis a\nconvex set. A state of the N -qubit system outside this set is called \u03b1k -inseparable.\nMore generally, a state \u03c1 is called k-separable [Laskowski and \u017bukowski, 2005;\nG\u00fchne et al., 2005; T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2006; Ac\u0131\u0301n et al., 2001; H\u00e4ffner et al., 2005],\nk-sep\ndenoted as \u03c1 \u2208 DN\n, iff there exists a convex decomposition\nX\nX\n(j)\npj = 1,\n(6.2)\npj \u2297kn=1 \u03c1Sn ,\npj \u2265 0,\n\u03c1=\nj\n\nj\n\n(j)\n\nwhere each state \u2297kn=1 \u03c1Sn is a tensor product of k density matrices of the subsys(j)\ntems corresponding to some such partition \u03b1k , i.e., it factorizes under this split\n(j)\n\u03b1k . In this definition, the partition may vary for each j, as long as it is a k-partite\nk-sep\nis also convex; it is the\nsplit, i.e., contains k disjoint non-empty sets. Clearly DN\n\u03b1k\nconvex hull of the union of all DN for fixed values of k and N . States that are not\nk-separable will be called k-inseparable. Note that a k-separable state need not be\n\u03b1k -separable for any particular split \u03b1k 2 . And even the converse implication need\nnot hold: If a state is bi-separable under every bipartition, it does not have to be\nfully separable, as shown by the three-partite examples of [Bennett et al., 1999b;\nEggeling and Werner, 2001; Ac\u0131\u0301n et al., 2001] that give states that are bi-separable\nwith respect to all bi-partite partitions, yet are not fully separable, i.e., they are\nthree-inseparable. Similar observations (using different terminology) were obtained\nby G\u00fchne et al. [2005] and T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne [2006], but below we will present a\nmore systematic investigation.\nThe notion of k-separability naturally induces a hierarchic ordering of the N (N \u22121)-sep\nN -sep\nk-sep\n\u2282\n\u2282 DN\nis nested: DN\nqubit states. Indeed, the sequence of sets DN\n1-sep\n* * * \u2282 DN . In other words, k-separability implies l-separability for all l \u2264 k. We\ncall a k-separable state that is not (k + 1)-separable \"k-separable entangled\". Thus,\neach N -qubit state can be characterized by the level k for which it is k-separable\nentangled, and these levels provide a hierarchical ranking: at one extreme end are\nthe 1-separable entangled states which are fully entangled (e.g., the GHZ states),\nat the other end are the N -separable or fully separable states (e.g. product states\nor the \"white noise state\" 11/2N ).\n2 For example, consider the following construction (which was inspired by T\u00f3th and\nG\u00fchne [2006]) where we use the N -qubit states | \u03c81 i = | ei12 | 0i3 | 0i4 * * * | 0iN ; | \u03c82 i =\n| 0i1 | ei23 | 0i4 * * * | 0iN ; . . . , | \u03c8N i = | 0i2 | 0i3 * * * | eiN,1 , where | eiij is any entangled pure state\nP\nof the two parties i and j (mod N ). Then the state \u03c1 = N\ni=1 | \u03c8i ih \u03c8i |/N is inseparable under all\nsplits, yet by construction (N \u2212 1)-separable.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n129\n\nOften, it is interesting to know how many qubits are entangled in a k-separable\nentangled state. However, this question does not have a unique answer. For example, take N = 4 and k = 2 (bi-separability). In this case two types of states may\noccur in the decomposition (6.2), namely \u03c1{ij} \u2297 \u03c1{kl} and \u03c1{i} \u2297 \u03c1{jkl} (i, j, k, l =\n1, 2, 3, 4). A 2-separable entangled four-partite state might thus be two- or threepartite entangled.\nIn general, an N -qubit state \u03c1 will be called m-partite entangled iff a decomposition of the state such as in (6.2) exists such that each subset S (i) contains at\nmost m parties, but no such decomposition is possible when all the k subsets are\nrequired to contain less than m parties [Seevinck and Uffink, 2001]. (G\u00fchne et\nal. [2005] and T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne [2006] call this 'not producible by (m \u2212 1)-partite\nentanglement'). It follows that a k-separable entangled state is also m-partite entangled, with \u2308N/k\u230b \u2264 m \u2264 N \u2212 k + 1. Here \u2308N/k\u230b denotes the smallest integer\nwhich is not less than N/k. Thus, a state that is k-separably entangled (k < N ) is\nat least \u2308N/k\u230b-partite entangled and might be up to (N \u2212 k + 1)-partite entangled.\nTherefore, conditions that distinguish k-separability from (k + 1)-separability also\nprovide conditions for m-partite entanglement, but generally allowing a wide range\nof values of m. For example, for N = 100 and k = 2, m might lie anywhere between\n50 and 99.\nOf course, a much tighter conclusion about m-partite entanglement can be drawn\nif we know exactly under which splits the state is separable. This is why the notion of \u03b1k -separability is helpful, since it provides these finer distinctions. For\nexample, suppose that a 100-qubit state is separable under the bi-partite split\n({1}, {2, . . . 100}) but under no other bi-partite split. This state would then be\n2-separable (bi-separable) but now we could also infer that m = 99. On the other\nhand, if the state were only separable under the split {1, . . . 50}, {51, . . . 100}, it\nwould still be bi-separable, but only m-partite entangled for m = 50.\nD\u00fcr and Cirac [2000] provided such a fine-grained classification of N -qubit states\nby considering their separability or inseparability under all k-partite splits. Let us\nintroduce this classification (with a slight extension) by means of the example of\nthree qubits, labeled as a, b, c.\nClass 3. Starting with the lowest level k = 3, there is only one 3-partite split,\na-b-c, and consequently only one class to be distinguished at this level , i.e. D3a-b-c .\nThis set coincides with D33-sep .\nClasses 2.1-2.8 Next, at level k = 2, there are three bi-partite splits: a-(bc),\na-(bc)\nb-(ac)\nc-(ab)\nb-(ac) and c-(ab) which define the sets D3\n, D3\n, and D3\n. One can further\ndistinguish classes defined by all logical combinations of separability and inseparability under these splits, i.e. all the set-theoretical intersections and complements\nshown in Figure 1. This leads to classes 2.2 \u2013 2.8. D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001]\nshowed that all these classes are non-empty. To these, we add one more class 2.1:\nthe set of bi-separable states that are not separable under any split. As we have\nseen, this set is non-empty too.\n\n\f130\n\nChapter 6\n\nClass 1. Finally, at level k = 1 there is again only one (trivial) split (abc), and\nthus only one class, consisting of all the fully entangled states, i.e., D31-sep \\ D32-sep .\n\n2.2\n\n2.1\n\n2.1\n2.5\n\n2.8\n\n2.6\n\n3\n\n2.3\n\n2.7\n\n2.4\n\n2.1\n\n1\n\nFigure 6.1: Schematic representation of the 10 partial separability classes of three-qubit\nstates\n\nWe feel that the above extension is desirable since otherwise the D\u00fcr-Cirac\nclassification would not distinguish between class 2.1 and class 1. However, states\nin class 2.1 are simply convex combinations of states that are bi-separable under\ndifferent bi-partite splits. Such states can be realized by mixing the bi-separable\nstates, and are conceptually different from the fully inseparable states of class 1.\nThis three-partite example serves to illustrate how the D\u00fcr-Cirac separability\nclassification works for general N . Level k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 N ) of the separability hierarchy consists of all k-separable entangled states. Each level is further divided\ninto distinct classes by considering all logically possible combinations of separability\nand inseparability under the various k-partite splits. The number of such classes\nincreases rapidly with N , and therefore we will not attempt to list them. In general,\nall such classes may be non-empty. As an extension of the D\u00fcr-Cirac classification,\nwe distinguish at each level 1 < k < N one further class, consisting of k-separable\nentangled states that are not separable under any k-partite split.\nIn order to find relations between these classes, the notion of a contained split is\nuseful [D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2000]. A k-partite split \u03b1k is contained in a l-partite split \u03b1l ,\ndenoted as \u03b1k \u227a \u03b1l , if \u03b1l can be obtained from \u03b1k by joining some of the subsets\nof \u03b1k . The relation \u227a defines a partial order between splits at different levels.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n131\n\nThis partial order is helpful because \u03b1k -separability implies \u03b1l -separability of all\nsplits \u03b1l containing \u03b1k . We will use this implication below to obtain conditions\nfor separability of a k-partite split at level k from such conditions on all (k \u2212 1)partite splits at level k\u22121 this k-partite split is contained in. One can thus construct\nseparability conditions for all classes at higher levels from the separability conditions\nfor classes at level k = 2. Conditions at a lower level thus imply conditions at a\nhigher level.\nThe multi-partite entanglement properties of k-separable or \u03b1k -separable states\nare subtle, as can be seen from the following examples.\n(i) mixing states does not conserve m-partite entanglement. Take N\u221a = 3,\nthen mixing the 2-partite\nentangled 2-separable states | 0i \u2297 (| 00i + | 11i)/ 2 and\n\u221a\n| 0i \u2297 (| 00i \u2212 | 11i)/ 2 with equal weights gives a 3-separable state (| 000ih 000| +\n| 011ih 011|)/2.\n(ii) an N -partite state can be m-partite entangled (m < N ) even if it has no\nm-partite subsystem whose (reduced) state is m-partite entangled [Seevinck and\nUffink, 2001; G\u00fchne et al., 2005]. Such states are said to have irreducible m-partite\nentanglement3 . Thus, a state of which some reduced state is m-partite entangled is\nitself at least m-partite entangled, but the converse need not be true.\n(iii) consider a bi-separable entangled state that is only separable under the bipartite split ({1}, {2, . . . , N }). One cannot infer that the subsystem {2, . . . , N } is\n(N \u2212 1)-partite entangled. A counterexample is the three-qubit state \u03c1 = (| 0ih 0| \u2297\n(bc)\n(bc)\nP\u2212 + | 1ih 1| \u2297 P+ )/2 which is bi-separable only under the partition a-(bc), and\nthus bi-partite entangled, but has no bi-partite subsystem whose reduced state\n(bc)\n(bc)\nis entangled. Here P+ and P\u2212 denote projectors on the Bell states | \u03c8 \u00b1 i =\n\u221a1 (| 01i \u00b1 | 10i) for parties b and c, respectively.\n2\n(iv) a state that is inseparable under all splits but which is not fully inseparable\nk-sep\n\u03b1k\n(i.e., \u03c1 \u2208 DN\nwith k > 1 and \u03c1 \u2208\n/ \u222a\u03b1k DN\n, \u2200 \u03b1k , k) might still have all forms\nof m-partite entanglement apart from full entanglement, i.e., it could be m-partite\nentangled with 2 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u2212 1. Thus the state could even have m-partite entanglement as low as 2-partite entanglement, although it is inseparable under all\nsplits. For example, [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2006] consider a mixture of two N -partite\nstates where each of them is (\u2308N/2\u230b)- separable according to different splits. This\nmixed state is by construction (\u2308N/2\u230b)- separable, not bi-separable under any split,\nyet only 2-partite entangled. See also the example in footnote 2 which is (N \u2212 1)separable and only 2-partite entangled.\n(v) Lastly, N -partite fully entangled states exist where no m-partite reduced\nstate is entangled (such as N -qubit GHZ state) and also where all m-partite reduced\nstates are entangled (such as the N -qubit W-states) [D\u00fcr, 2001a].\n3 Note that Walck and Lyons [2008] use the same notion of 'irreducible m-partite entanglement',\nbut with a different meaning. Their notion is used to denote multi-partite states whose set of\nreduced states does not suffice to uniquely determine the state. This we believe is better referred\nto as 'underdetermination by the set of reduced states'.\n\n\f132\n\nChapter 6\n\nThese examples serve to emphasize that one should be very cautious in inferring\nthe existence of entanglement in subsystems of a larger system which is known to\nbe m-partite entangled or k-separable entangled for some specific value of m and k.\n\n6.2.2\n\nSeparability Conditions\n\nWe now review four separability conditions for qubits, which will all be strengthened\nin the next section. These are necessary conditions for states to be k-separable, 2separable, and \u03b1k -separable respectively.\n(I) Laskowski and \u017bukowski [2005] showed that for any k-separable N -qubit\nstate \u03c1 the anti-diagonal matrix elements (denoted by \u03c1j,\uf6be\u0304 , where \uf6be\u0304 = d + 1 \u2212 j,\nd = 2N ) must satisfy\nmax |\u03c1j,\uf6be\u0304 | \u2264\nj\n\n1 \u0001k\n,\n2\n\nk-sep\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n\n(6.3)\n\nThis condition can be easily proven by the observation that for any density matrix\nto be physically meaningful its anti-diagonal matrix elements must not exceed 1/2.\nTherefore, anti-diagonal elements of a product of k density matrices cannot be\ngreater than (1/2)k . For pure states this can be checked directly4 and by convexity,\nthis results then holds all k-separable states. Note that this condition is not basis\ndependent.\nIt follows from (6.3) that if the anti-diagonal matrix elements of state \u03c1 obey\n1 \u0001k\n1 \u0001k+1\n\u2265 max |\u03c1j,\uf6be\u0304 | >\n,\nj\n2\n2\n\n(6.4)\n\nthen \u03c1 is at most k-separable, i.e., k-separable entangled, and thus at least m-partite\nentangled, with m \u2265 \u2308N/k\u230b.\nThe partial separability condition (6.3) does not yet explicitly refer to directly\nexperimentally accessible quantities. However, in the next section we will rewrite\nthis condition in terms of expectation values of local observables, and show that\nthey are equivalent to Mermin-type separability inequalities.\n(II) Mermin-type separability inequalities [Nagata et al., 2002a; Roy, 2005;\nUffink, 2002; Seevinck and Svetlichny, 2002; Gisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci, 1998;\nCollins et al., 2002]. Consider the familiar CHSH operator for two qubits (labeled\nas a and b) which is defined by:\nM (2) := Xa \u2297 Xb + Xa \u2297 Yb + Ya \u2297 Xb \u2212 Ya \u2297 Yb .\n\n(6.5)\n\n4 The proof that the modulus of an anti-diagonal matrix element in a physically allowable\nstate must be less than 1/2 runs as follows. Consider a d-dimensional system with orthonormal\nbasis | 1i, | 2i, . . . , | di. Next consider a general pure state of the form | \u03c8i = \u03b1| 1i + . . . + \u03b2| di.\nNormalization gives |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 \u2264 1 (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C). The anti-diagonal matrix element \u03c11,d = h 1|\u03c1| di\nis equal to \u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 . Since we are interested in the maximum absolute value of this element we choose\nall other coefficients zero, to obtain |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1, and hence |\u03c11,d | \u2264 1/2. The proof for all other\nanti-diagonal matrix elements is analogous.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n133\n\nHere, Xa and Ya denote two spin observables on the Hilbert spaces Ha and Hb of\nqubit a, and b. The so-called Mermin operator [Mermin, 1990] is a generalization of\nthis operator to N qubits (labeled as (a, b, . . . n)), defined by the recursive relation:\nM (N ) :=\n\n1\n1 (N \u22121)\nM\n\u2297 (Xn + Yn ) + M \u2032(N \u22121) \u2297 (Xn \u2212 Yn ),\n2\n2\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhere M \u2032 is the same operator as M but with all X's and Y 's interchanged.\nIn the special case where, for each qubit, the spin observables X and Y are\northogonal, i.e. {Xi , Yi } = 0 for i \u2208 {a, . . . n}, Nagata et al. [2002a] obtained the\nfollowing k-separability conditions:\nhM (N ) i2 + hM \u2032(N ) i2 \u2264 2(N +3)\n\n1 \u0001k\nk-sep\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n4\n\n(6.7)\n\nAs just mentioned, the next section will show that these inequalities are equivalent\nto the Laskowski-\u017bukowski inequalities. The quadratic inequalities (6.7) also imply\nthe following sharp linear Mermin-type inequality for k-separability:\nN +3\n)\n2\n\n|hM (N ) i| \u2264 2(\n\n1 \u0001k\nk-sep\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n2\n\n(6.8)\n\nFor k = N inequality (6.8) reproduces a result obtained by Roy [2005].\n(III). The fidelity F (\u03c1) of a N -qubit state \u03c1 with\u221arespect to the generalized\n\u2297N\nN -qubit GHZ state | \u03a8N\n+ ei\u03b1 | 1i\u2297N )/ 2 (\u03b1 \u2208 R) is defined as\nGHZ,\u03b1 i := (| 0i\nN\nF (\u03c1) := maxh\u03a8N\nGHZ,\u03b1 |\u03c1|\u03a8GHZ,\u03b1 i =\n\u03b1\n\n1\n(\u03c11,1 + \u03c1d,d) + |\u03c11,d |,\n2\n\n(6.9)\n\nThe fidelity condition [Sackett et al., 2000; Seevinck and Uffink, 2001; Zeng et al.,\n2003] (also known as the projection-based witness [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a]) says\nthat for all bi-separable \u03c1:\n2-sep\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n\nF (\u03c1) \u2264 1/2,\n\n(6.10)\n\nIn other words, F (\u03c1) > 1/2 is a sufficient condition for full N -partite entanglement.\nAn equivalent formulation of (6.10) is:\nX\n2-sep\n2|\u03c11,d | \u2264\n\u03c1j,j , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n(6.11)\nj6=1,d\n\nOf course, analogous conditions may be obtained by replacing | \u03a8N\nGHZ,\u03b1 i in the\ndefinition (6.9) by any other maximally entangled state [Zeng et al., 2003; Nagata et al., 2002b]. Exploiting this feature, one can reformulate (6.11) in a basisindependent form:\nX\n2-sep\n2 max |\u03c1j,\uf6be\u0304 | \u2264\n\u03c1i,i , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n(6.12)\nj\n\ni6=j,\uf6be\u0304\n\nNote that in contrast to the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition and the Mermin-type\nseparability inequalities, the fidelity condition does not distinguish bi-separability\nand other forms of k-separability. Indeed, a fully separable state (e.g. | 0\u2297N i can\n\n\f134\n\nChapter 6\n\nalready attain the value F (\u03c1) = 1/2. Thus, the fidelity condition only distinguishes\nfull inseparability (i.e., k = 1) from other types of separability (k \u2265 2). However, as\nwill be shown in the next section, violation of the fidelity condition yields a stronger\ntest for full entanglement than violation of the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition.\n(IV) The D\u00fcr-Cirac depolarization method [D\u00fcr et al., 1999; D\u00fcr and Cirac,\n2000] gives necessary conditions for partial separability under specific bi-partite\nsplits. It uses a two-step procedure in which a general state \u03c1 is first depolarized to\nbecome a member of a special family of states, called \u03c1N , after which this depolarized state is tested for \u03b12 -separability under a bi-partite split \u03b12 . If the depolarized\nstate \u03c1N is not separable under \u03b12 , then neither is the original state \u03c1, but not\nnecessarily vice versa since the depolarization process can decrease inseparability.\nThe special family of states \u03c1N is given by\n\u03c1N =\n\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bb+\n0 | \u03c80 ih \u03c80 | + \u03bb0 | \u03c80 ih \u03c80 | +\n\n\u22121\n2NX\n\u22121\n\nj=1\n\n\u03bbj (| \u03c8j+ ih \u03c8j+ | + | \u03c8j\u2212 ih \u03c8j\u2212 |),(6.13)\n\nwith the so-called orthonormal GHZ-basis | \u03c8j\u00b1 i = \u221a12 | j0i \u00b1 | j \u2032 1i), where j =\nj1 j2 . . . jN \u22121 is in binary notation (i.e., a string of N \u22121 bits), and j \u2032 means a bit-flip\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof j: j \u2032 = j1\u2032 j2\u2032 . . . jN\n\u22121 , with ji = 1, 0 if ji = 0, 1. The depolarization process does\n\u00b1\nnot alter the values of \u03bb0 = h \u03c80\u00b1 |\u03c1| \u03c80\u00b1 i and of \u03bbj = (h \u03c8j+ |\u03c1| \u03c8j+ i+h \u03c8j\u2212 |\u03c1| \u03c8j\u2212 i)/2 of\nthe original state \u03c1. The values of j = j1 j2 . . . jN \u22121 can be used to label the various\nbi-partite splits by stipulating that j = j1 j2 . . . jN \u22121 , jn = 0, (1) corresponds to\nthe n-th qubit belonging (not belonging) to the same subset as the last qubit. For\nexample, the splits a-(bc), b-(ac), c-(ab) have labels j = 10, 01, 11 respectively.\nThe D\u00fcr-Cirac condition [D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2000] says that a state \u03c1 is separable\nunder a specific bi-partite split j if\n\u2212\n|\u03bb+\n0 \u2212 \u03bb0 | \u2264 2\u03bbj\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n2|\u03c11,d | \u2264 \u03c1l,l + \u03c1l\u0304,l\u0304 ,\n\nj\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n,\n\nl\u0304 = d + 1 \u2212 l,(6.14)\n\nFor the states (6.13) this condition is in fact necessary and sufficient. In the\nright-hand side of the second inequality of (6.14) l is determined from j using\nTr[\u03c1| \u03c8j+ ih \u03c8j+ | + | \u03c8j\u2212 ih \u03c8j\u2212 |] = \u03c1l,l + \u03c1l\u0304,l\u0304 .\nSeparability conditions for multi-partite splits are constructed from the conditions (6.14) by means of the partial order \u227a of containment. As mentioned above, if\na state is \u03b1k -separable, then it is also \u03b12 -separable for all bi-partite splits \u03b1k \u227a \u03b12 .\nTherefore, the conjunction of all \u03b12 -separability conditions must hold for such a\nstate.\n\u2212\nNote that if |\u03bb+\n0 \u2212 \u03bb0 | > 2 maxj \u03bbj , the state is inseparable under all bi-partite\nsplits, but this does not imply that it is fully inseparable (cf. footnote 2). Indeed,\nthis feature also exists for states of the form (6.13) as the following example shows.\nTake the following two members of the family (6.13) for N = 3: for \u03c1i3 we choose\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nii\n\u03bb+\n0 = 1/2, \u03bb0 = 0, \u03bb01 = 0, \u03bb10 = 1/4, \u03bb11 = 0, and for \u03c13 : \u03bb0 = 1/2, \u03bb0 = 0,\ni\n\u03bb01 = 0, \u03bb10 = 0, \u03bb11 = 1/4. It follows from condition (6.14) that \u03c13 is separable\nunder split a-(bc) and inseparable under other splits, while \u03c1ii\n3 is separable under\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n135\n\nthe split c-(ab) and inseparable under any other split. Now form a convex mixture\nof these two states: \u03c1\u03033 = \u03b1\u03c1i3 + \u03b2\u03c1ii\n3 with \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1). This state \u03c1\u03033\nis still of the form (6.13), so that we can again apply condition (6.14) to conclude\nthat \u03c1\u03033 is not separable under any bi-partite split, yet bi-separable by construction.\nIn the next section we give necessary conditions for k-separability and \u03b1k separability that are stronger than the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition (for k = 2, N ),\nthe fidelity condition and the D\u00fcr-Cirac condition.\n\n6.3\n\nDeriving new partial separability conditions\n\nIn this section we present k-separability conditions for all levels and classes in the\nhierarchic classification of N -qubit states. Violations of the conditions give strong\ncriteria for specific forms of non-separability and m-partite entanglement. The\nstarting point will be the two-qubit results of chapter 4, whose result we rehearse\nhere for both convenience and for introducing the notation to be used in this chapter.\nWe next move on to the slightly more complicated case of three qubits, for which\nexplicit separability conditions are given for each of the 10 classes in the separability\nhierarchy that were depicted in Figure 6.1. Finally, the case of N -qubits is treated\nby a straightforward generalization.\n\n6.3.1\n\nTwo-qubit case: setting the stage\n\nFor two-qubit systems the separability hierarchy is very simple: there is only one\npossible split, and consequently just one class at each of the two levels k = 1 and\nk = 2, i.e., states are either inseparable (entangled) or separable.\nConsider a system composed of a pair of qubits in the familiar setting of two\ndistant sites, each receiving one of the two qubits, and where, at each site, a measurement of either of two spin observables is made. We will focus on the special case\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nthat these local spin observables are mutually orthogonal. Let (Xa , Ya , Za ) de(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nnote three orthogonal spin observables on qubit a, and (Xb , Yb , Zb ) on qubit\nb. (The superscript 1 denotes that we are dealing with single-qubit operators.) A\nfamiliar choice for the orthogonal triples {X (1) , Y (1) , Z (1) } are the Pauli matrices\n{\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z }. But note that the choice of the two sets need not coincide. We further\n(1)\ndefine Ia,b := 1. For all single-qubit pure states | \u03c8i we have\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nhXj i2\u03c8 + hYj i2\u03c8 + hZj i2\u03c8 = hIj i2\u03c8 ,\n\nj = a, b,\n\n(6.15)\n\nand for mixed states \u03c1\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nhXj i2 + hYj i2 + hZj i2 \u2264 hIj i2 ,\n\nj = a, b.\n\n(6.16)\n\nWe write Xa Xb or even XX etc. as shorthand for Xa \u2297 Xb and hXXi :=\nTr[\u03c1Xa \u2297 Xb ] for the expectation value in a general state \u03c1, and hXXi\u03a8 := h \u03a8|Xa \u2297\nXb | \u03a8i for the expectation in a pure state | \u03a8i.\n\n\f136\n\nChapter 6\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nSo, let two triples of locally orthogonal observables be given, denoted as {Xa , Ya , Za }\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nand {Xb , Yb , Zb }, where a, b label the different qubits. We further introduce\ntwo sets of four two-qubit operators on H = C2 \u2297 C2 , labeled by the subscript\nx = 0, 1:\n(2)\n\nX0\n\n(2)\n\nY0\n\n(2)\n\nZ0\n\n(2)\n\nI0\n\n1 (1) (1)\n(X X \u2212 Y (1) Y (1) )\n2\n1\n:= (Y (1) X (1) + X (1) Y (1) )\n2\n1 (1) (1)\n:= (Z I + I (1) Z (1) )\n2\n1 (1) (1)\n:= (I I + Z (1) Z (1) )\n2\n\n(2)\n\nX1\n\n:=\n\n(2)\n\nY1\n\n(2)\n\nZ1\n\n(2)\n\nI1\n\n1 (1) (1)\n(X X + Y (1) Y (1) )\n2\n1\n:= (Y (1) X (1) \u2212 X (1) Y (1) )\n2\n1\n:= (Z (1) I (1) \u2212 I (1) Z (1) )\n2\n1\n:= (I (1) I (1) \u2212 Z (1) Z (1) ).\n2\n:=\n\n(6.17)\n\nHere, the superscript label indicates that we are dealing with two-qubit operators.\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nLater on, Xx will sometimes be notated as Xx,ab , and similarly for Yx , Zx and\n(2)\n\nIx . This more extensive labeling will prove convenient for the multi-qubit gener(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nalization. Note that (Xx )2 = (Yx )2 = (Zx )2 = (Ix )2 = Ix for x = 0, 1, and\nthat all eight operators mutually anti-commute. Furthermore, if the orientations of\nthe two triples is the same, these two sets form representations of the generalized\nPauli group, i.e., they have the same commutation relations as the Pauli matrices\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\non C2 , i.e.: [Xx , Yx ] = 2iZx , etc. and\nhXx(2) i2 + hYx(2) i2 + hZx(2) i2 \u2264 hIx(2) i2 ,\n\nx \u2208 {0, 1},\n\n(6.18)\n\nwith equality only for pure states. Note that we can rewrite the CHSH inequality\n(2)\n(2)\n(4.2) in terms of these observables as: |hX0 + Y0 i| \u2264 1, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D22-sep .\nLet us now consider the separability inequalities of chapter 4. In terms of the\nobservables of (6.17) the separability inequality of (4.9) becomes:\nhXx(2) i2 + hYx(2) i2 \u2264\n(2)\n\n1 (1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(hI i \u2212 hZa(1) i2 )(hIb i \u2212 hZb i2 ),\n4 a\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D22-sep .\n\n(6.19)\n\n(2)\n\nSince (hX0 + Y0 i)2 + (hX0 p\u2212 Y0 i)2 = 2(hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 ) we obtain from\n(2)\n(2)\n(6.19) that |hX0 + Y0 i| \u2264 1/2, thereby reproducing (4.10)\n\u221a which shows the\nstrengthening of the CHSH separability inequality by a factor 2.\nThe separability condition of (6.19) can be strengthened even further as was\ndone in section 4.4 to produce (4.26). In terms of the notation of this chapter this\nseparability condition is\n\nmax\n\n(\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nhX0 i2 + hY0 i\n(2)\n(2)\nhX1 i2 + hY1 i\n\n)\n\n\u2264 min\n\n(\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nhI0 i2 \u2212 hZ0 i2\n(2)\n(2)\nhI1 i2 \u2212 hZ1 i2\n\n)\n\n\u2264\n\n1\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D22-sep .\n4\n(6.20)\n\nIf we leave out the upper bound of 1/4 in (6.20), then of the four inequalities in\n(6.20) two are trivially true for all states, whether separable or not, and the other\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n137\n\ntwo in fact provide the separability criteria. Which two of the four depends on the\norientation of the local orthogonal observables. Let us choose the orientations for\n(2)\n(2)\nboth parties to be the same, then the non-trivial inequalities are hX0 i2 + hY0 i \u2264\n(2) 2\n(2) 2\n(2) 2\n(2)\n(2) 2\n(2) 2\nhI1 i \u2212 hZ1 i and hX1 i + hY1 i \u2264 hI0 i \u2212 hZ0 i . Choosing the orientations\nto be different gives the other two non-trivial inequalities.\nTo conclude this section we give an explicit form of the separability inequalities\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(6.20) by choosing the Pauli matrices {\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z } for both triples {Xa , Ya , Za }\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nand {Xb , Yb , Zb }. This choice enables us to write the inequalities (6.20) in terms\nof the density matrix elements on the standard z-basis {| 00i, | 01i, | 10i, | 11i}, la(2)\nbeled here as {| 1i, | 2i, | 3i, | 4i}. This choice of observables yields hX0 i = 2Re \u03c11,4 ,\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nhY0 i = \u22122Im \u03c11,4 , hI0 i = \u03c11,1 + \u03c14,4 , hZ0 i = \u03c11,1 \u2212 \u03c14,4 , hX1 i = 2Re \u03c12,3 ,\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nhY1 i = \u22122Im \u03c12,3 , hI1 i = \u03c12,2 + \u03c13,3 , hZ1 i = \u03c12,2 \u2212 \u03c13,3 . So, in this choice, we\ncan write (6.20) as:\nmax{|\u03c11,4 |2 , |\u03c12,3 |2 } \u2264 min{\u03c11,1 \u03c14,4 , \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 } \u2264\n\n1\n,\n16\n\n\u03c1 \u2208 D22-sep .\n\n(6.21)\n\nIn the form (6.21), it is easy to compare the result to the separability conditions\nreviewed in subsection II.B5 . Assume for simplicity that |\u03c11,4 | is the largest of all the\nanti-diagonal elements |\u03c1j\uf6be\u0304 |. Then, for \u03c1 \u2208 D22-sep , and using hM (2) i2 + hM \u2032(2) i2 =\n(2)\n(2)\n8(hX0 i2 +hY0 i2 ) the Mermin-type separability inequality (6.7) becomes |\u03c11,4 |2 \u2264\n1/16, which is equivalent to the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition |\u03c11,4 | \u2264 1/4; the\nfidelity/D\u00fcr-Cirac conditions read: 2|\u03c11,4 | \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c13,3 ; and the condition (6.21):\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03c11,4 |2 \u2264 \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 . Using the trivial inequality ( \u03c122 \u2212 \u03c133 )2 \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 \u2264\n\u03c12,2 + \u03c13,3 , we can then write the following chain of inequalities\nsep \u221a\nA\nA\n4|\u03c11,4 | \u2212 (\u03c11,1 + \u03c14,4 ) \u2264 2|\u03c11,4 | \u2264 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c13,3 \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c13,3 ,\nA\n\n(6.22)\n\nsep\n\nwhere we used the symbols \u2264 and \u2264 to denote inequalities that hold for all states,\nand for the separability condition (6.21) respectively.\nThe Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition is then recovered by comparing the first and\nfourth expressions in this chain, the fidelity/ D\u00fcr-Cirac conditions by comparing the\nsecond and fourth expression, and a new condition \u2013 not previously mentioned \u2013 can\nbe obtained by comparing the first and third term, whereas condition (6.21), i.e.\nthe comparison between the second and third expression in (6.22), is the strongest\ninequality in this chain, and thus implies and strengthens all of these other conditions.\n\n6.3.2\n\nThree-qubit case\n\nWe now derive separability conditions that distinguish the 10 classes in the 3-qubit\nclassification of section 6.2.1 by generalizing the method of section 6.3.1. To begin\n5 This comparison has already been performed in chapter 4 but will be repeated here for completeness\n\n\f138\n\nChapter 6\n\nwith, define four sets of three-qubit observables from the two-qubit operators (6.17):\n(3)\n\nX0\n\n(3)\n\nY0\n\n(3)\n\nZ0\n\n(3)\n\nI0\n\n(3)\n\nX2\n\n(3)\n\nY2\n\n(3)\n\nZ2\n\n(3)\n\nI2\n\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(X (1) X0 \u2212 Y (1) Y0 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Y (1) X0 + X (1) Y0 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Z (1) I0 + I (1) Z0 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (I (1) I0 + Z (1) Z0 )\n2\n:=\n\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(X (1) X1 \u2212 Y (1) Y1 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Y (1) X1 + X (1) Y1 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Z (1) I1 + I (1) Z1 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (I (1) I1 + Z (1) Z1 )\n2\n\n:=\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(3)\n\nX1\n\n(3)\n\nY1\n\n(3)\n\nZ1\n\n(3)\n\nI1\n\n(3)\n\nX3\n\n(3)\n\nY3\n\n(3)\n\nZ3\n\n(3)\n\nI3\n\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(X (1) X0 + Y (1) Y0 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Y (1) X0 \u2212 X (1) Y0 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Z (1) I0 \u2212 I (1) Z0 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (I (1) I0 \u2212 Z (1) Z0 )\n2\n:=\n\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(X (1) X1 + Y (1) Y1 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Y (1) X1 \u2212 X (1) Y1 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (Z (1) I1 \u2212 I (1) Z1 )\n2\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n:= (I (1) I1 \u2212 Z (1) Z1 ),\n2\n:=\n\n(6.23)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere X (1) X0 = Xa \u2297 X0,bc , etc., a, b, c label the three qubits. In analogy to the\ntwo-qubit case, we note that all these operators anticommute and that if the orientations of the triples for each qubit are the same, the operators in (6.23) yield rep(3)\n(3)\n(3)\nresentations of the generalized Pauli group: [Xx , Yx ] = 2iZx , for x = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nFor convenience, we will indeed assume these orientations to be the same, unless\nnoted otherwise. Choosing orientations differently would yield similar separability\nconditions, in the same vein as in the previous section. Under this choice we have,\nfor all k,\nhXx(3) i2 + hYx(3) i2 + hZx(3) i2 \u2264 hIx(3) i2 ,\n\nk-sep\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n\n(6.24)\n\nwith equality only for pure states.\nWe now derive conditions for the different levels and classes of the partial separability classification. Most of the proofs are by straightforward generalization of\nthe method of the previous section and these will be omitted.\nSuppose first that the three-qubit state is pure and separable under split a-(bc).\nFrom the definitions (6.23) we obtain:\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nhX0 i2 + hY0 i2 =\n=\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nhI0 i2 \u2212 hZ0 i2 =\nhX2 i2 + hY2 i2 =\n=\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nhI2 i2 \u2212 hZ2 i2 =\n\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(3)\n(3)\n( hXa(1) i2 + hYa(1) i2 ) ( hX0,bc i2 + hY0,bc i2 ) = hX1 i2 + hY1 i2\n4\n(6.25)\n1\n(3)\n(2)\n(2)\n(3)\n( hIa(1) i2 \u2212 hZa(1) i2 ) ( hI0,bc i2 \u2212 hZ0,bc i2 ) = hI1 i2 \u2212 hZ1 i2 ,\n4\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(3)\n(3)\n( hXa(1) i2 + hYa(1) i2 ) ( hX1,bc i2 + hY1,bc i2 ) = hX3 i2 + hY3 i2\n4\n(6.26)\n1\n(2)\n(2)\n(3)\n(3)\n( hIa(1) i2 \u2212 hZa(1) i2 ) ( hI1,bc i2 \u2212 hZ1,bc i2 ) = hI3 i2 \u2212 hZ3 i2 .\n4\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n139\n\nSimilarly, for pure states that are separable under split b-(ac), we obtain analogous\nequalities by interchanging the labels x = 1 and x = 3 (denoted as 1 \u2194 3); and for\nsplit c-(ab) by 1 \u2194 2.\nOf course, these equalities hold for pure states only, but by the convex analysis\nof section 6.3.1 we obtain from (6.25), (6.26) inequalities for all mixed states that\nare bi-separable under the split a-(bc):\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n1\n4\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n1\n4\n\nmax hXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 min hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\nx\u2208{0,1}\n\nx\u2208{0,1}\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nmax hXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 min hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\nx\u2208{2,3}\n\nx\u2208{2,3}\n\n,\n\na-(bc)\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D3\n\n.\n\n(6.27)\n\nFor states that are bi-separable under split b-(ac) the analogous inequalities with\n1 \u2194 3 hold, i.e.,\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n1\n4\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n1\n4\n\nmax hXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 min hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\nx\u2208{0,3}\n\nx\u2208{0,3}\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nmax hXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 min hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\nx\u2208{1,2}\n\nx\u2208{1,2}\n\nb-(ac)\n\n.\n\n(6.28)\n\nc-(ab)\n\n.\n\n(6.29)\n\n,\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D3\n\n,\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D3\n\nand for the split c-(ab) we need to replace 1 \u2194 2:\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n1\n4\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n1\n4\n\nmax hXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 min hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\nx\u2208{0,2}\n\nx\u2208{0,2}\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nmax hXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 min hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\nx\u2208{1,3}\n\nx\u2208{1,3}\n\nA general bi-separable state \u03c1 \u2208 D32-sep is a convex mixture of states that are\nseparable under some bi-partite split, i.e., \u03c1 = p1 \u03c1a-(bc) + p2 \u03c1b-(ac) + p3 \u03c1c-(ab) with\nq\nP3\n(3)\n(3)\nhX0 i2 + hY0 i2 is convex in \u03c1 we get from (6.27- 6.29) for\nj=1 pj = 1.

If one would alter the orientation\nof the orthogonal triple of observables for a certain qubit, then the right-hand side\nof (6.33) changes by adding either 1, 2 or 3 (modulo 3) to x in the sum on the right\nhand side, depending on for which qubit the orientation was changed.\nNext, consider the case of a 3-separable state, \u03c1 \u2208 D33-sep . One might then use\nthe fact that this split is contained in all three bi-partite splits a-(bc), b-(ac) and\nc-(ab) to conclude that the inequalities (6.27, 6.28, 6.29) must hold simultaneously.\nThus, 3-separable states must obey:\nmax{hXx(3) i2 + hYx(3) i2 } \u2264 min{hIx(3) i2 \u2212 hZx(3) i2 } \u2264\nx\n\nx\n\n1\n,\n4\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D33-sep .

(6.37)\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n141\n\nIn summary, the states at the different separability levels k = 1, 2, 3 have state\n(3)\n(3)\nindependent bounds for the quantities hXx i2 + hYx i2 , x \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, that differ\na factor 4 for each level. They are respectively 1, 1/4 and 1/16. These bounds can\n(3)\n(3)\nbe strengthened by state-dependent bounds that use the quantities hIx i2 \u2212hZx i2 .\nThis gives the separability inequalities (6.33), (6.34) and (6.37). Separability with\nrespect to specific splits results in strong state-dependent bounds such as for example given in (6.27) for the split a-(bc).

For example, if inequality (6.37) is violated, then\nthe state must be in one of the bi-separable classes 2.1 to 2.8 or in class 1, which\nimplies that the state is at least 2-partite entangled; if (6.33) violated it is in class\n1 and thus fully inseparable (fully entangled), and so on.\nIn order to gain further familiarity with the above separability inequalities, we\nchoose the ordinary Pauli matrices {\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z } for the locally orthogonal observables {X (1) , Y (1) , Z (1) }, and formulate them in terms of density matrix elements in\nthe standard z-basis.

The condition (6.33) for bi-separability yields:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03c11,8 | \u2264 \u03c12,2 \u03c17,7 + \u03c13,3 \u03c16,6 + \u03c14,4 \u03c15,5\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03c12,7 | \u2264 \u03c11,1 \u03c18,8 + \u03c13,3 \u03c16,6 + \u03c14,4 \u03c15,5\n,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03c13,6 | \u2264 \u03c11,1 \u03c18,8 + \u03c12,2 \u03c17,7 + \u03c14,4 \u03c15,5\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03c14,5 | \u2264 \u03c11,1 \u03c18,8 + \u03c12,2 \u03c17,7 + \u03c13,3 \u03c16,6\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D32-sep .\n\n(6.42)\n\nFinally, condition (6.34) for general 3-separable states becomes: \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D33-sep :\n1\n.\n64\n(6.43)\n\nmax{|\u03c11,8 |2 , |\u03c12,7 |2 , |\u03c13,6 |2 , |\u03c14,5 |2 } \u2264 min{\u03c11,1 \u03c18,8 , \u03c12,2 \u03c17,7 , \u03c13,3 \u03c16,6 , \u03c14,4 \u03c15,5 } \u2264\n\nNote that the separability inequalities (6.38)-(6.43) all give bounds on anti-diagonal\nelements in terms of diagonal elements.\nWe will now show that these bounds improve upon the separability conditions\ndiscussed in section 6.2.2. We focus on the anti-diagonal element \u03c11,8 (i.e., we\nsuppose that this is the largest anti-diagonal matrix element) since this is easiest\nfor comparison. However, the same argument holds for any other anti-diagonal\nmatrix element.\nThe D\u00fcr-Cirac conditions in terms of |\u03c11,8 | read as follows. For partial separability under the split a-(bc): 2|\u03c11,8 | \u2264 \u03c14,4 + \u03c15,5 , under the split b-(ac): 2|\u03c11,8 | \u2264\n\u03c13,3 + \u03c16,6 , and lastly under the split c-(ab): 2|\u03c11,8 | \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c17,7 . Next, the\nLaskowski-\u017bukowski condition (6.3) gives for \u03c1 \u2208 D32-sep that |\u03c11,8 | \u2264 1/4 and for\n\u03c1 \u2208 D33-sep that |\u03c11,8 | \u2264 1/8. The fidelity condition (6.9) gives that if \u03c1 \u2208 D32-sep\nthen 2|\u03c11,8 | \u2264 \u03c12,2 + . . . + \u03c17,7 .\nIn order to show that all these conditions are implied by our separability conditions, we employ some inequalities which hold for all states \u03c1: |\u03c11,8 |2 \u2264 \u03c11,1 \u03c18,8\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(this follows from (6.24)), and ( \u03c14,4 \u2212 \u03c15,5 )2 \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 2 \u03c14,4 \u03c15,5 \u2264 \u03c14,4 + \u03c15,5 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand similarly 2 \u03c13,3 \u03c16,6 \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c16,6 and 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c17,7 \u2264 \u03c12,2 + \u03c17,7 . Using these\ntrivial inequalities one easily sees that the conditions (6.38)-(6.40) imply the D\u00fcrCirac conditions for separability under the three bi-partite splits. It is also easy to\nsee that the condition for 3-separability (6.43) strengthens the Laskowski-\u017bukowski\ncondition (6.3) for k = 3. However, it is not so easy to see that (6.42) strengthens\nboth the fidelity and Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition for k = 2. We will nevertheless\nshow that this is indeed the case.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\nA\n\n143\n\n2-sep\n\nLet us use the symbols \u2264 and \u2264 to denote inequalities that hold for all states\nor for bi-separable states respectively. Combining the above trivial inequalities with\ncondition (6.42) yields the following sequence of inequalities:\n2-sep \u221a\nA\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4|\u03c11,8 | \u2212 (\u03c11,1 + \u03c18,8 ) \u2264 2|\u03c11,8 | \u2264 2 \u03c14,4 \u03c15,5 +2 \u03c13,3 \u03c16,6 + 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c17,7\nA\n\n\u2264 \u03c12,2 + * * * + \u03c17,7 .\n\n(6.44)\n\nThe inequality between the second and third expression is (6.42). It implies the\nother inequalities that follow from (6.44). Comparing the first and fourth expression\nof (6.44) one obtains the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition (6.3), while a comparison\nof the second and fourth yields the fidelity criterion (6.9). Comparing the first and\nthird term gives a new condition which was not previously mentioned. All these are\nimplied by condition (6.42).\nTo end this section we show that the separability inequalities for x = 0 give\nMermin-type separability inequalities. Consider the Mermin operator [Mermin,\n1990] for three qubits:\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nM (3) := Xa(1) Xb Yc(1) + Ya(1) Xb Xc(1) + Xa(1) Yb Xc(1) \u2212 Ya(1) Yb Yc(1) , (6.45)\n\nand define M \u2032(3) in the same way, but with all X and Y interchanged. We can\n(3)\n(3)\nnow use the identity 16(hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 ) = hM (3) i2 + hM \u2032(3) i2 to obtain from\nthe separability conditions (6.31) and (6.37) the following quadratic inequality for\nk-separability:\n1 \u0001k\n(3)\n(3)\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D3k-sep .\n(6.46)\n16(hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 ) = hM (3) i2 + hM \u2032(3) i2 \u2264 64\n4\n\nOf course, a similar bound holds when hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 in the left-hand side is replaced by hXx i2 + hYx i2 for x = 1, 2, 3. This reproduces, for N = 3, the result\n(6.7) of Nagata et al. [2002a]. From the density matrix representation, we see that\nthese Mermin-type separability conditions are in fact equivalent to the Laskowski\u017bukowski condition (6.3). These quadratic inequalities imply the following linear\nMermin-type Bell-inequalities for partial separability:\n|hM3 i| \u2264 23\u2212k , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D3k-sep .\n\n(6.47)\n\nThese inequalities are sharp so that sup\u03c1\u2208Dk-sep |hM3 i| = 23\u2212k . For full separability\n3\n(k = 3) this reproduces a result obtained by Roy [2005], and for bi-separability\n(k = 2) this reproduces the result of T\u00f3th et al. [2005]. Note that these conditions\ndo not distinguish the different classes within level k = 2, as was the case in (6.38)(6.40).\nLastly, we note that (6.47) for k = 2, which holds for locally orthogonal observables, strengthens the following Mermin-type bi-separability inequality that holds\nfor general observables A, A\u2032 , B, B \u2032 and C, C \u2032 [Gisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci,\n1998; Seevinck and Uffink, 2001]:\n|hABC \u2032 + AB \u2032 C + A\u2032 BC \u2212 A\u2032 B \u2032 C \u2032 i| \u2264 23/2 ,\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D32-sep .\n\n(6.48)\n\n\f144\n\nChapter 6\n\nAgain we see that the restriction to orthogonal observables gives stronger conditions.\n6.3.2.1\n\nAnalysis of experiment producing full three-qubit entanglement\n\nIn an early work by Seevinck and Uffink [2001] several experiments were discussed\nand it was investigated whether three-qubit entanglement was present in these experiments. It was there concluded that the experiments did not provide conclusive\nevidence for such full three-qubit entanglement. However, in that analysis the\nMermin-type bi-separability inequality (6.48) was used (amongst others) to test\nfor full entanglement. But as shown above, this bi-separability condition can be\nsharpened for the case of orthogonal observables to (6.47), i.e., to |hM3 i| \u2264 2.\nThe experiment described by Pan et al. [2000]6 aimed to create a GHZ state with\nthree photons and indeed used such orthogonal observables. They obtained a value\nof hM3 i = 2.83 \u00b1 0.09. We can thus conclude that although this experiment did not\nviolate the original Mermin-type separability inequality (6.48) it does violate the\ncondition (6.47) that holds for orthogonal observables thereby indicating full threequbit entanglement. This sheds new light on old experimental data in [Pan et al.,\n2000] and shows that genuine three-qubit entanglement has already been realized\nexperimentally.\nNote that D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001] also claimed that this experiment created\nfull three-qubit entanglement. However, their analysis in fact only tested for inseparability with respects to all possible bi-partite splits, and not for full inseparability,\ni.e., for full entanglement. Thus they can indeed claim that the experiment has\nshown the existence of a state that is inseparable with respect to all splits, but not\nthat it has shown full three-qubit entanglement.\nFinally, we note that using some idealization assumptions about the data of the\nexperiment of Pan et al. [2000] Nagata et al. [2002b] showed that the experiment\ncontained three-particle entanglement but without using a Mermin-type separability\ninequality.\n\n6.3.3\n\nN-qubit case\n\nIn this section we generalize the analysis of the previous section to N qubits to\nobtain conditions for k-separability and \u03b1k -separability. The proofs are analogous\nto the previous cases, and will be omitted. Explicit conditions for k-separability\nare presented for all levels k = 1, . . . , N . Further, we give a recursive procedure\nto derive \u03b1k -separability conditions for each k-partite split \u03b1k at all level k. From\nthese, one can easily construct the conditions that distinguish all the classes in N partite separability classification by enumerating all possible logical combinations\nof separability or inseparability under each of these splits at a given level. We\nwill however not attempt to write down these latter conditions explicitly since the\nnumber of classes grows exponentially with the number of qubits. We start by\n6 See\n\nalso Bouwmeester et al. [2000, p. 209].\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n145\n\nconsidering bi-partite splits, and bi-separable states (level k = 2), and then move\nupwards to obtain separability conditions for splits on higher levels.\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\nWe define 2(N \u22121) sets of four observables {Xx , Yx , Zx , Ix } , with\nx \u2208 {0, 1, . . . ,\n2(N \u22121) \u2212 1} recursively from the (N \u2212 1)-qubit observables:\nXy(N ) :=\n(N )\n\nXy+1 :=\nYy(N ) :=\n(N )\n\nYy+1 :=\nZy(N ) :=\n(N )\n\nZy+1 :=\nIy(N ) :=\n(N )\n\nIy+1 :=\n\n1\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(X (1) \u2297 Xy/2 \u2212 Y (1) \u2297 Yy/2 )\n2\n1\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(X (1) \u2297 Xy/2 + Y (1) \u2297 Yy/2 )\n2\n1 (1)\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(Y\n\u2297 Xy/2 + X (1) \u2297 Yy/2 )\n2\n1 (1)\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(Y\n\u2297 Xy/2 \u2212 X (1) \u2297 Yy/2 )\n2\n1 (1)\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(Z \u2297 Iy/2 + I (1) \u2297 Zy/2 )\n2\n1 (1)\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(Z \u2297 Iy/2 \u2212 I (1) \u2297 Zy/2 )\n2\n1 (1)\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(I \u2297 Iy/2 + Z (1) \u2297 Zy/2 )\n2\n1 (1)\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n(I \u2297 Iy/2 \u2212 Z (1) \u2297 Zy/2 ),\n2\n\n(6.49)\n\nwith y even, i.e., y \u2208 {0, 2, 4, . . .}. Analogous relations between these observables hold as those between the observables (6.17) and (6.23). In particular, if\nthe orientations of each triple of local orthogonal observables is the same, these sets\nform representations of the generalized Pauli group, and every N -qubit state obeys\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\nhXx i2 + hYx i2 \u2264 hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 , with equality only for pure states.\n6.3.3.1\n\nBi-separability\n\nConsider a state that is separable under some bi-partite split \u03b12 of the N qubits.\nFor each such split we get 2(N \u22121) separability inequalities in terms of the sets\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n{Xx , Yx , Zx , Ix } labeled by x \u2208 {0, 1 . . . , 2(N \u22121) \u2212 1}. These separability inequalities provide necessary conditions for the N -qubit state to be separable\nunder the split under consideration. In order to find these inequalities, we first\ndetermine the N -qubit analogs of the three-qubit pure state equalities (6.25) and\n(6.26) corresponding to this bi-partite split. We have not found a generic expression\nthat lists them all for each possible split and all x. However, for the split where\nthe first qubit is separated from the (N \u2212 1) other qubits, i.e. \u03b12 = a-(bc . . . n) a\n\n\f146\n\nChapter 6\n\ngeneric form can be given:\n1\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\n( hXa(1) i2 + hYa(1) i2 ) ( hXx/2 i2 + hYx/2 i2 )\n4\n(N )\n(N )\n= hXx+1 i2 + hYx+1 i2 =\n1\n(N \u22121)\n(N \u22121)\nhIx(N ) i2 \u2212 hZx(N ) i2 = ( hIa(1) i2 \u2212 hZa(1) i2 ) ( hIx/2 i2 \u2212 hZx/2 i2 )\n4\n(N )\n(N )\n= hIx+1 i2 \u2212 hZx+1 i2 ,\n(6.50)\n\nhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 =\n\nwhere, without loss of generality, x is chosen to be even, i.e. x \u2208 {0, 2, 4, . . .}. For\nother bi-partite splits the sets of observables labeled by x are permuted, in a way\ndepending on the particular split.\nFor example, for N = 4 where x \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , 7} the equalities (6.50) give the\nresult for the split a-(bcd). The corresponding equalities for other bi-partite splits\nare obtained by the following permutations of x: for split b-(acd): 1 \u2194 3 and 5 \u2194 7;\nfor split c-(abd): 1 \u2194 6 and 3 \u2194 4; and for split d-(abc): 1 \u2194 4 and 3 \u2194 6. For the\nsplit (ab)-(cd): 1 \u2194 2 and 5 \u2194 6; for (ac)-(bd): 1 \u2194 7 and 3 \u2194 5; and lastly, for\n(ad)-(bc): 1 \u2194 5 and 3 \u2194 7.\nFor mixed states that are separable under a given bi-partite split the equalities\n(6.50) (and their analogs obtained via suitable permutations) become inequalities.\nWe again state them for the split a-(bc . . . n):\n)\n)\n(\n(\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n1\nhIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2\nhXx i2 + hYx i2\na-(bc...n)\n,\n\u2264 , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n\u2264 min\nmax\n(N ) 2\n(N ) 2\n(N ) 2\n(N ) 2\n4\nhIx+1 i \u2212 hZx+1 i\nhXx+1 i + hYx+1 i\n(6.51)\n\nwith x \u2208 {0, 2, 4, . . .}. The proof of (6.51) is a straightforward generalization of the\nconvex analysis in section 6.3.1. Again, for the other bi-partite splits, the labels x\nare permuted in a way depending on the particular split.\n2-sep\nFor a general bi-separable state \u03c1 \u2208 DN\n, we thus obtain the following biseparability conditions:\nhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264 1/4, \u2200x,\n\n2-sep\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n,\n\n(6.52)\n\nwhich is equivalent to the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition for k = 2 (as will be shown\nbelow). And just as in the three-qubit case, we also obtain a stronger condition\nq\nX q (N )\n(N ) 2\n(N ) 2\n(N )\n2-sep\nhXx i + hYx i \u2264\nhIy i2 \u2212 hZy i2 , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n,\n(6.53)\ny6=x\n\nwith x, y = 0, 1, . . . , 2(N \u22121) \u2212 1. Violation of this inequality is a sufficient condition\nfor full inseparability, i.e., for full N -partite entanglement.\nThe inequalities (6.53) are stronger than the fidelity criterion (6.9) and the\nLaskowski-\u017bukowski criterion (6.3) for k = 2, and inequalities (6.51) are stronger\nthan the D\u00fcr-Cirac condition (6.14) for separability under bi-partite splits. This\nwill be shown below in subsection 6.3.3.3.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n6.3.3.2\n\n147\n\nPartial separability criteria for levels 2 < k \u2264 N\n\nFor levels k > 2 we sketch a procedure to find \u03b1k+1 -separability inequalities recursively from inequalities at the preceding level. Suppose that at level k the inequalities are given for separability under each k-partite split \u03b1k of the N qubits, and\nthat these \u03b1k -separability inequalities take the form:\nmax\nhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264 min\nhIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 \u2264\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nx\u2208zi\n\nk\n\nx\u2208zi\n\nk\n\n1\n\u03b1k\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n,\n4(k\u22121)\n\n(6.54)\n\nwith i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , 2(N \u2212k) }. where zi\u03b1k denote 'solution sets' for the specific kpartite split \u03b1k . For example, in the case of three qubits, the solution sets for the\na-(bc)\na-(bc)\n= {2, 3}, as can be seen from\nbi-partite split a-(bc) are z1\n= {0, 1} and z2\n(6.27).

Call the collection of these k-partite splits S\u03b1(k+1) . We then obtain preliminary\nseparability inequalities for the split \u03b1k+1 from the conjunction of all separability\ninequalities for the splits \u03b1k in the set S\u03b1(k+1) . To be specific, this yields:\nmax\n\nmax hXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264\n\n\u03b1k \u2208S\u03b1k+1 x\u2208z \u03b1k\ni\n\nmin\n\nmin hIx(N ) i2 \u2212 hZx(N ) i2\n\n\u03b1k \u2208S\u03b1(k+1) x\u2208z \u03b1k\ni\n\n\u2264\n\n1\n\u03b1\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN(k+1) ,\n4k\u22121\n\n(6.55)\n\nThis may be written more compactly as\nmax\nhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264\n\u03b1\n\nx\u2208zi\n\nk+1\n\nmin\nhIx(N ) i2 \u2212 hZx(N ) i2 \u2264\n\u03b1\n\nx\u2208zi\n\nk+1\n\n1\n4k\u22121\n\n\u03b1\n\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN(k+1) ,\n(6.56)\n\nwith i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , 2(N \u2212k\u22121) }. (In fact, this can be regarded as an implicit definition\n\u03b1\nof the solution sets zi k+1 .) More importantly, by an argument similar to that leading\n\n\f148\n\nChapter 6\n\nfrom (6.34) to (6.37) one finds a stronger numerical bound in the utmost right-hand\nside of these inequalities, namely 4\u2212k instead of 4\u2212(k\u22121) . Thus, the final result is:\nmax\nhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264\n\u03b1\n\nx\u2208zi\n\nk+1\n\nmin\nhIx(N ) i2 \u2212 hZx(N ) i2 \u2264\n\u03b1\n\nx\u2208zi\n\nk+1\n\n1\n\u03b1\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN(k+1) ,\n4k\n(6.57)\n\nwith i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , 2(N \u2212k\u22121) }. This shows that the \u03b1k -separability inequalities indeed take the same form as (6.54) at all levels.\nAs an example of this recursive procedure, take N = 4, set k = 3, and choose\nthe split a-b-(cd). This split is contained in three 2-partite splits a-(bcd), b-(acd)\nand (ab)-(cd). Using (6.55) and the first, second and fifth column of table 6.2 one\na-b-(cd)\nobtains the following two solutions sets for the split a-b-(cd): z1\n= {0, 1, 2, 3}\na-b-(cd)\nand z2\n= {4, 5, 6, 7}.

States \u03c1 that are separable under this split thus obey:\nmaxhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264 minhIx(N ) i2 \u2212 hZx(N ) i2 \u2264\nx\n\nx\n\n1\n,\n4(N \u22121)\n\nN -sep\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n. (6.59)\n\nViolation of this inequality is a sufficient condition for some entanglement to be\npresent in the N -qubit state. The condition (6.59) strengthens the Laskowski\u017bukowski condition (6.3) for k = N (to be shown below).\nk-sep\nFor an N -qubit k-separable state \u03c1 \u2208 DN\n, i.e., a state that is a convex mixture\nof states that are separable under some k-partite split, we obtain from (6.57) the\nfollowing k-separability conditions:\nhXx(N ) i2 + hYx(N ) i2 \u2264\n\n1\n, \u2200x,\n4(k\u22121)\n\nk-sep\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n,\n\n(6.60)\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n149\n\nwhich is equivalent to the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition (6.3) for all N and k (this\nwill be shown below using the density matrix formulation of these conditions).\nHowever, in analogy to (6.33) we also obtain the stronger condition:\nq\nX q (N )\n(N ) 2\n(N ) 2\n(N )\nk-sep\nhXx i + hYx i \u2264 min\nhIy i2 \u2212 hZy i2 , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n, (6.61)\nl\n\nN,x\ny\u2208Tk,l\n\nN,x\nwhere, for given N, k and x, Tk,l\ndenotes a tuple of values of y 6= x, each one being\npicked from each of the solutions sets zi\u03b1k that contain x, where \u03b1k ranges over all\nthe k-partite splits of the N qubits. In general, there will be many ways of picking\nsuch values, and we use l as an index to label such tuples.\nFor example, in the case N = 3, there are a total of 6 solution sets (two for\neach of the three bi-partite splits): {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {0, 3}, {1, 2}. If we\nset x = 0 and pick a member different from 0 from each of those sets that contain 0,\n3\nwe find: T2,1\n= {1, 2, 3}. This is in fact the only such choice and thus l = 1. Thus,\nin this example condition (6.61) reproduces the result (6.33).\nAs a more complicated example, take N = 4, k = 3, and choose again x = 0. In\nthis case there are six 3-partite splits each of which has two solution sets, as given in\ntable 6.3. The solution sets that contain 0 are all on the top row of this table. There\nare now many ways of constructing a tuple by picking elements that differ from 0\n4,0\n4,0\n= {1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6},\n= {1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1}, T3,2\nfrom each of these sets , for example T3,1\netc. In this case one has to take a minimum in (6.61) over all these l = 1, . . . , 36\ntuples.\nFor k = 2, condition (6.61) reduces to (6.53) and for k = N to (6.59). For\nthese values of k, the condition is stronger than (6.60) (see the next section). For\nk 6= 2, N , this is still an open question.\nTo conclude this subsection, let us recapitulate. We have found separability\nconditions in terms of local orthogonal observables for each of the N parties that\nare necessary for k-separability and for separability under splits \u03b1k at each level on\nthe hierarchic separability classification. Violations of these separability conditions\ngive sufficient criteria for k-separable entanglement and m-partite entanglement\nwith \u2308N/k\u230b \u2264 m \u2264 N \u2212 k + 1. The separability conditions are stronger than the\nD\u00fcr-Cirac condition for separability under specific splits, and stronger than the\nfidelity condition and the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition for bi-separability. The\nlatter condition is also strengthened for k = N . These implications are shown in\nthe next section.\n\n6.3.3.3\n\nThe conditions in terms of matrix elements\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\nChoosing the Pauli matrices {\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z } as local orthogonal observables, with\nthe same orientation at each qubit, allows one to formulate the separability conditions in terms of the density matrix elements \u03c1i,j on the standard z-basis7 .

For example, for N = 4: \u03c11,16 = h 0000|\u03c1| 1111i and\n\n\f150\n\nChapter 6\n\nthese choices we obtain:\n(N )\n\nX0\n\n(N )\n\nY0\n\n(N )\nI0\n(N )\n\nZ0\n\n(N )\n\n= | 0ih 1|\u2297N + | 1ih 0|\u2297N ,\n= | 0ih 0|\n\n+ | 1ih 1|\n\n\u2297N\n\ni = 2Re \u03c11,d ,\n\nhY0\n\ni = \u22122Im \u03c11,d ,\n\n(N )\n\n= \u2212i| 0ih 1|\u2297N + i| 1ih 0|\u2297N ,\n\u2297N\n\nhX0\n\n(N )\nhI0 i\n\n,\n\n(N )\n\n= | 0ih 0|\u2297N \u2212 | 1ih 1|\u2297N ,\n\nhZ0\n(N )\n\n= \u03c11,1 + \u03c1d,d ,\n\ni = \u03c11,1 \u2212 \u03c1d,d ,\n\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n(6.62)\n\n(N )\n\nwhere d = 2N . Analogous relations hold for Xx , Yx , Zx , Ix for x 6= 0.\nLet us treat the case N = 4 in detail. First, consider the level k = 2. Biseparability under the split a-(bcd) gives the following inequalities for the antidiagonal matrix elements:\nmax{|\u03c11,16 |2 , |\u03c18,9 |2 }\nmax{|\u03c12,15 |2 , |\u03c17,10 |2 }\nmax{|\u03c13,14 |2 , |\u03c16,11 |2 }\nmax{|\u03c15,12 |2 , |\u03c14,13 |2 }\n\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\nmin{\u03c11,1 \u03c116,16 , \u03c18,8 \u03c19,9 }\nmin{\u03c12,2 \u03c115,15 , \u03c17,7 \u03c110,10 }\nmin{\u03c13,3 \u03c114,14 , \u03c16,6 \u03c111,11 }\nmin{\u03c15,5 \u03c112,12 , \u03c14,4 \u03c113,13 }\n\n\u2264 1/16\n\u2264 1/16\n,\n\u2264 1/16\n\u2264 1/16\n\na-(bcd)\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D4\n\n(6.63)\n\nThe analogous inequalities for separability under other bi-partite splits are obtained\nby suitable permutations on the labels. Indeed, for split b-(acd) labels 8 and 5,\n9 and 12, 2 and 3, 5 and 14 are permuted, which we denote as: (8, 9, 2, 15) \u2194\n(5, 12, 3, 14); and for split c-(abd): (8, 9, 2, 15) \u2194 (3, 14, 5, 12); for split d-(abc):\n(8, 9, 3, 14) \u2194 (2, 15, 5, 12); for the split (ab)-(cd): (8, 9, 3, 14) \u2194 (4, 13, 7, 10); for\n(ac)-(bd): (8, 9, 5, 12) \u2194 (6, 11, 7, 10); and lastly, for the split (ad)-(bc): (8, 9, 5, 12) \u2194\n(7, 10, 6, 11). For a general bi-separable state we obtain\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(6.64)\n|\u03c11,16 | \u2264 \u03c12,2 \u03c115,15 + \u03c13,3 \u03c114,14 + . . . + \u03c18,8 \u03c19,9 , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D42-sep ,\nand analogous for the other anti-diagonal elements.\nNext, consider one level higher, i.e., k = 3. There are six different 3-partite\nsplits for a system consisting of four qubits. For separability under each such split\na different set of inequalities can be obtained from (6.55). To be more precise, such\na set consists of the conjunction of all the separability inequalities for the bi-partite\nsplits at level k = 2 this particular 3-partite split is contained in. For N = 4 each\n3-partite split is contained in three bi-partite splits. For example, for separability\nunder split a-b-(cd) we obtain:\n\b\nmax |\u03c11,16 |2 , |\u03c18,9 |2 , |\u03c14,13 |2 , |\u03c15,12 |2\n\b\n\u2264 min \u03c11,1 \u03c116,16 , \u03c18,8 \u03c19,9 , \u03c14,4 \u03c113,13 , \u03c15,5 \u03c112,12 \u2264 1/64,\n\b\nmax |\u03c12,15 |2 , |\u03c13,14 |2 , |\u03c16,11 |2 , |\u03c17,10 |2\n\b\n\u2264 min \u03c12,2 \u03c115,15 , \u03c13,3 \u03c114,14 , \u03c16,6 \u03c111,11 , \u03c17,7 \u03c110,10 \u2264 1/64.\n(6.65)\n\u03c19,12 = h 1000|\u03c1| 1011i.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n151\n\nThis is the density matrix formulation of (6.58).\nA general 3-separable state \u03c1 \u2208 D43-sep is a convex mixture of states that each\nare separable under some such 3-partite split. The separability condition follows\nfrom (6.61):\nX \u221a\n\u03c1j,j \u03c117\u2212j,17\u2212j ), \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D43-sep ,\n(6.66)\n|\u03c11,16 | \u2264 min(\nl\n\n4,0\nj\u2208T\u03033,l\n\n4,0\nwhere T\u03033,l\nis the tuple of indices j \u2208 {1, 16} that label the anti-diagonal density\nmatrix elements \u03c1j,17\u2212j corresponding to the density matrix formulation of the set\n(4)\n(4)\n4,0\nof operators hXy i2 + hYy i with y determined by T3,l\n. Here we have used that\n(4)\n\n(4)\n\nthe anti-diagonal element \u03c11,16 corresponds to hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 . For N = 4, k = 3\nthere are six possible splits, so for each l, j is picked from a total of six sets. For the\ncase under consideration the sets are {1, 4, 5, 8}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 5, 7}, {1, 2, 5, 6},\n{1, 2, 7, 8}, and {1, 3, 6, 8}. For each l one chooses a tuple of values of j where one\nvalue is picked from each of these six sets, except for the value 1 which is excluded.\nAnalogous inequalities are obtained for the other anti-diagonal matrix elements.\nFinally for full separability (k = 4) we get:\nmax{|\u03c11,16 |2 , |\u03c12,15 |2 , . . . , |\u03c18,9 |2 } \u2264 min{\u03c11,1 \u03c116,16 , \u03c12,2 \u03c115,15 , . . . , \u03c18,8 \u03c19,9 } \u2264 1/256,\n(6.67)\nwith \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 D44-sep .\nFor general N , it is easy to see that (6.52) yields the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition (6.3). It is instructive to look at the extremes of bi-separability and full\nseparability, since for them explicit forms can be given. For k = 2 condition (6.53)\nreads:\nX\u221a\n2-sep\n\u03c1n,n \u03c1n\u0304,n\u0304 /2, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n|\u03c1l,l\u0304 | \u2264\nwhere  \u0304l = d + 1 \u2212 l, n\u0304 = d + 1 \u2212 n,\nn6=l,l\u0304\n\n(6.68)\n\nwith l, n \u2208 {1, . . . , d}. For k = N , we can reformulate condition (6.59) as\nN -sep\nmax{|\u03c11,d |2 , |\u03c12,d\u22121 |2 . . .} \u2264 min{\u03c11,1 \u03c1d,d , \u03c12,2 \u03c1d\u22121,d\u22121 , . . .} \u2264 1/4N , \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n(6.69)\n\nIt is easily seen that the condition (6.69) is stronger than the Laskowski-\u017bukowski\ncondition (6.3) for this case.\nAgain, these inequalities give bounds on anti-diagonal matrix elements in terms\nof diagonal ones on the z-basis. These density matrix representations depend on\nthe choice of the Pauli matrices as the local observables. However, every other\ntriple of locally orthogonal observables with the same orientation can be obtained\nfrom the Pauli matrices by suitable local basis transformations, and therefore this\nmatrix representation does not loose generality. Choosing different orientations of\n\n\f152\n\nChapter 6\n\nthe triples one obtains the corresponding inequalities by suitable permutations of\nanti-diagonal matrix elements.\nWe will now show that (6.68) is indeed stronger than the fidelity condition (6.9)\nand the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition (6.3) for k = 2 by following the same analysis\nas in the three-qubit case. We again assume, for convenience, that the anti-diagonal\nelement \u03c11,d is the largest of all anti-diagonal elements. Using some inequalities that\nhold for all states together with the condition (6.68) for bi-separability we get the\nfollowing sequence of inequalities for \u03c11,d :\n2sep \u221a\nA\n\u221a\n4|\u03c11,d | \u2212 (\u03c11,1 + \u03c1d,d ) \u2264 2|\u03c11,d | \u2264 2 \u03c12,2 \u03c1d\u22121,d\u22121 + * * * + 2 \u03c1d/2,d/2 \u03c1d/2+1,d/2+1\nA\n\n\u2264 \u03c122 + * * * + \u03c1d\u22121,d\u22121 .\n\n(6.70)\n\nThe inequality in the middle is (6.68). It implies all other inequalities in the sequence\n(6.70). The inequality between the first and fourth term yields the Laskowski\u017bukowski condition for k = 2, and between the second and fourth gives the fidelity\ncriterion in the formulation (6.11). One also sees that the fidelity criterion is stronger\nthan the Laskowski-\u017bukowski condition for k = 2.\nWe finally discuss two examples showing that the bi-separability condition (6.68)\nis stronger in detecting full entanglement than other methods. First, consider the\nfamily of N -qubit states\n\u03c1\u2032N\n\n=\n\n+\n+\n\u03bb+\n0 | \u03c80 ih \u03c80 |\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bb\u2212\n0 | \u03c80 ih \u03c80 |\n\n+\n\n\u22121\n2NX\n\u22121\n\nj=1\n\n\u03bbj (| \u03c8k+ i + | \u03c8j\u2212 i)(h \u03c8j+ | + h \u03c8j\u2212 |).\n(6.71)\n\n\u2212\nThe states (6.71) violate (6.68) for all |\u03bb+\n0 \u2212 \u03bb0 | 6= 0 and are thus detected as\nfully entangled by that condition. In that case they are also inseparable under any\nsplit. The fidelity criterion (6.11), however, detects these states as fully entangled\nP\n\u2212\nonly for |\u03bb+\n0 \u2212 \u03bb0 | \u2265\nj \u03bbj . Violation of (6.68) thus allows for detecting more\nstates of the form \u03c1\u2032N as fully entangled than violation of the fidelity criterion.\nFurther, the D\u00fcr-Cirac criteria detect these states as inseparable under any split\n\u2212\nfor |\u03bb+\n0 \u2212 \u03bb0 | > 2\u03bbj , \u2200j, which includes less states than a violation of (6.68). This\ngeneralizes the observation of Ota et al. [2007] from two qubits to the N -qubit case.\nSecondly, consider the N -qubit GHZ-like states | \u03b8i = cos \u03b8| 0i\u2297N + sin \u03b8| 1i\u2297N\nwith density matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ncos2 \u03b8\n* * * cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n(6.72)\n| \u03b8ih \u03b8| = \uf8ed ...\n\uf8f8.\n.\n2\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 * * * sin \u03b8\n\nWe can easily read off from the density matrix | \u03b8ih \u03b8| that the far off-anti-diagonal\nmatrix elements \u03c11,d = \u03c1d,1 is equal to cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 and that the diagonal matrix\nelements \u03c12,2 , . . . , \u03c1d\u22121,d\u22121 are all equal to zero. Using (6.68) we see that these\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n153\n\nstates are fully N -partite entangled for \u03c11,d = cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 6= 0, i.e., for all \u03b8 6= 0, \u03c0/2\n(mod \u03c0). Thus, all fully entangled states of this form are detected by condition\n(6.68), including those not detectable by any standard multi-partite Bell inequality\n[\u017bukowski et al., 2002].\n6.3.3.4\n\nRelationship to Mermin-type inequalities for partial separability\nand to LHV models\n\nWe will now show that the separability inequalities of the previous section imply\nalready known Mermin-type inequalities for partial separability.\n(N )\n(N )\nUsing the identity 2(N +1) (hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 ) = hM (N ) i2 + hM \u2032(N ) i2 , for the\nMermin operators (6.6) together with the upper bound for the separability inequality of (6.60) for x = 0 gives the following sharp quadratic inequality:\nhM (N ) i2 + hM \u2032(N ) i2 \u2264 2(N +3)\n\n1 \u0001k\nk-sep\n, \u2200\u03c1 \u2208 DN\n.\n4\n\n(6.73)\n\nwhich reproduces the result (6.7) found by Nagata et al. [2002a]. Since (6.52) is\nequivalent to (6.3) we see that the Mermin type separability condition is in fact one\nof Laskowski-\u017bukowski conditions written in terms of local observables X and Y .\nAs a special case we consider a split of the form {1}, . . . , {\u03ba}, {\u03ba + 1, . . . , n}).\nAny state that is separable under this split is (\u03ba + 1)-separable so we get the\ncondition hM (N ) i2 + hM \u2032(N ) i2 \u2264 2(N \u22122\u03ba+1) , and hence |hM (N ) i| \u2264 2(N \u22122\u03ba+1)/2 .\nThis strengthens the result of Gisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci [1998] by a factor\n2\u03ba/2 for these specific Mermin operators (6.6).\nAs another special case of the inequalities (6.73), consider k = N . In this case,\nthe inequalities express a condition for full separability of \u03c1. These inequalities\nare maximally violated by fully entangled states by an exponentially increasing\nfactor of 2N \u22121 , since the maximal value of |hM (N ) i| for any quantum state \u03c1 is\n2(N +1)/2 [Werner and Wolf, 2000]. Furthermore, LHV models violate them also\nby an exponentially increasing factor of 2(N \u22121)/2 , since for all N , LHV models\nallow a maximal value for |hM (N ) i| of 2 [Gisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci, 1998;\nSeevinck and Uffink, 2001], which is a factor 2(N \u22121)/2 smaller than the quantum\nmaximum using entangled states. This bound for LHV models is sharp since the\nmaximum is attained by choosing the LHV expectation values h\u03c3xi i = h\u03c3yi i = 1 for\nall i \u2208 {1, . . . , N }. This shows that there are exponentially increasing gaps between\nthe values of |hM (N ) i| attainable by fully separable states, fully entangled states\nand LHV models. This is shown in Figure 6.2.\nThat the maximum violation of multi-partite Bell inequalities allowed by quantum mechanics grows exponentially with N with respect to the value obtainable\nby LHV models has been known for quite some years [Mermin, 1990; Werner and\nWolf, 2000]. However, it is equally remarkable that the maximum value obtainable\nby separable quantum states exponentially decreases in comparison to the maximum\nvalue obtainable by LHV models, cf. Fig. 6.2. We thus see exponential divergence\nbetween separable quantum states and LHV theories: as N grows, the latter are\n\n\f154\n\nChapter 6\n\nable to give correlations that need more and more entanglement in order to be\nreproducible in quantum mechanics.\nBut why does quantum mechanics have correlations larger than those obtainable\nby a LHV model? Here we give an argument showing that it is not the degree of\nentanglement but the degree of inseparability that is responsible. The degree of\nentanglement of a state may be quantified by the value m that indicates the mpartite entanglement of the state, and the degree of inseparability by the value of\nk that indicates the k-separability of the state. Now suppose we have 100 qubits.\nFor partial separability of k \u2265 51 no state of these 100 qubits can violate the\nMermin inequality (6.8) above the LHV bound, although the state could be up to\n50-partite entangled (m \u2264 50). However, for k = 2, a state is possible that is also\n50-partite entangled, but which allows for violation of the Mermin inequality by\nan exponentially large factor of 297/2 . For k < N , a k-separable state is always\nentangled in some way, so we see that it is the degree of partial separability, not the\namount of entanglement in a multi-qubit state that determines the possibility of a\nviolation of the Mermin inequality. Of course, some entanglement must be present,\nbut the inseparability aspect of the state determines the possibility of a violation.\nThis is also reflected in the fact that for a given N it is the value of k, and not that\nof m, which determines the sharp upper bounds of the Mermin inequalities.\n\n4\n\n(N ) 2\n\nhX0\n\nb\n\n(N ) 2\n\ni + hY0\n\ni\n\nb\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\nrs\n\n2\n\n5\n\nN\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFigure 6.2: The maximum value for hX0 i2 + hY0 i2 obtainable by entangled quantum states\n(dots), by separable quantum states (crosses) and by LHV models (squares), plotted as a\nfunction of the number of qubits N . Note the exponential divergence between both the\nmaxima obtained for entangled states as well as for separable states compared to the LHV\nvalue, where the former maximum is exponentially increasing and the latter maximum is\nexponentially decreasing.\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n6.4\n\n155\n\nExperimental strength of the k-separable\nentanglement criteria\n\nViolations of the above conditions for partial separability provide sufficient criteria\nfor detecting k-separable entanglement (and m-partite entanglement with \u2308N/k\u230b \u2264\nm \u2264 N \u2212 k + 1). It has already been shown that these criteria are stronger than\nthe Laskowski-\u017bukowski criterion for k-inseparability for k = 2, N (i.e., detecting\nsome and full entanglement), the fidelity criterion for full inseparability (i.e., full\nentanglement) and the D\u00fcr-Cirac criterion for inseparability under splits. In this\nsection we will elaborate further on the experimental usefulness and strength of\nthese entanglement criteria, when focusing on specific N -qubit states. The strength\nof an entanglement criterion to detect a given entangled state may be assessed by\ndetermining how well it copes with two desiderata [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a]: the\nnoise robustness of the criterion for this given state should be high, and the number\nof local measurements settings needed for its implementation should be small.\nIn this section we will first take a closer look at the issue of noise robustness and\nat the number of required settings for implementation of the separability criteria,\nboth in the general state-independent case and in the case of detecting target states.\nWe then show the strength of the criteria for a variety of specific N -qubit states.\n\n6.4.1\n\nNoise robustness and the number of measurement\nsettings\n\nWhite noise robustness of an entanglement criterion for a given entangled state is\nthe maximal fraction p0 of white noise which may be admixed to this state so that\nthe state can no longer be detected as entangled by the criterion. Thus, for a given\nentangled state \u03c1, the noise robustness of a criterion is the threshold value p0 for\nwhich the state \u03c1 = p 1/2N + (1 \u2212 p)\u03c1, with p \u2265 p0 can no longer be detected by\nthat criterion.\nSo, for the criterion for detecting full entanglement (6.68), the white noise robustness is found by solving the threshold equation for p0 :\nr\nX\np0\np0\n(6.74)\n|(1 \u2212 p0 )\u03c1l,l\u0304 | =\n( N + (1 \u2212 p0 )\u03c1j,j )( N + (1 \u2212 p0 )\u03c1\uf6be\u0304,\uf6be\u0304 ),\n2\n2\nj6=l\n\nThe state is fully entangled for p < p0 .\nFor the criterion (6.69), for detecting some entanglement, one finds a similar\nthreshold equation:\np0\np0\nmax{|(1 \u2212 p0 )\u03c1l,l\u0304 |2 } = min{( N + (1 \u2212 p0 )\u03c1j,j )( N + (1 \u2212 p0 )\u03c1\uf6be\u0304,\uf6be\u0304 )}. (6.75)\nj\nl\n2\n2\nThis equation is quadratic and easily solved. Again, the state is entangled for\np < p0 .\nA local measurement setting [Bourenanne et al., 2004; Terhal, 2002; G\u00fchne and\nHyllus, 2003] is an observable such as M = \u03c31 \u2297 \u03c3l . . . \u2297 \u03c3N , where \u03c3l denote single\n\n\f156\n\nChapter 6\n\nqubit observables for each of the N qubits. Measuring such a setting (determining\nall coincidence probabilities of the 2N outcomes) also enables one to determine the\nprobabilities for observables like 1 \u2297 \u03c32 . . . \u2297 \u03c3N , etc. [G\u00fchne et al., 2007]. Now\n(N )\n(N )\nconsider the observables Xx and Yx that appear in the separability criteria of\n(6.50)-(6.61). As is easily seen from their definitions in (6.49), one can measure such\nan observable using 2N local settings. However, these same 2N settings then suffice\n(N )\n(N )\nto measure the observables Xx and Yx\nfor all other x since these are linear\nN\ncombinations of the same settings. Thus, 2 measurement settings are sufficient\n(N )\n(N )\nto determine hXx i and hYx i for all x. It remains to determine the number of\n(N )\n(N )\nsettings needed for the terms hIx i and hZx i. For all x these terms contain only\ntwo single-qubit observables: Z (1) and I (1) = 1. They can thus be measured by a\n\u0001\u2297N\nsingle setting, i.e., Z (1)\n.\nThus, in total 2N + 1 settings are needed in order to test the separability conditions. This number grows exponentially with the number of qubits. However,\nthis is the price we pay for being so general, i.e., for having criteria that work for\nall states. If we apply the criteria to detecting forms of inseparability and entanglement of specific entangled N -qubit states, this number can be greatly reduced.\nKnowledge of the target state enables one to select a single separability inequality\nfor an optimal value of x in (6.50)-(6.61). Violation of this single inequality is then\nsufficient for detecting the entanglement in this state, and, as we will now show,\nthe required number of settings then grows only linear in N , with N + 1 being the\noptimum for many states of interest.\nFor simplicity, assume that the local observables featuring in the criteria are the\nPauli spin observables with the same orientation for each qubit. We can then readily\nuse the density matrix representations of the separability criteria given at the end of\neach subsection in the previous section. Choosing the local observables differently\namounts to performing suitable bases changes to the density matrix representations\nand would not affect the argument.\nThe matrix representations of the conditions show that only some anti-diagonal\nmatrix elements and the values of some diagonal matrix elements have to be determined in order to test whether these inequalities are violated. Indeed, observe that\n(N )\n(N )\nfor all x hIx i2 \u2212 hZx i2 = 4\u03c1j,j \u03c1\uf6be\u0304,\uf6be\u0304 with \uf6be\u0304 = d + 1 \u2212 j for some j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , d}\n(N )\n(N )\nand hXx i2 \u2212 hYx i2 = 4|\u03c1j,\uf6be\u0304 |2 denotes some anti-diagonal matrix element. It suffices to consider x = 0 since conditions for other values of x are obtained by some\nlocal unitary basis changes that will be explicitly given later on. We now want to\nrewrite the density matrix representation for this single separability inequality with\nx = 0 in terms of less than 2N + 1 settings.\nDetermining the diagonal matrix elements requires only a single setting, namely\n\u03c3z\u2297N . Next, we should determine the modulus of the far-off anti-diagonal element\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n(N )\n\u03c11,d (d = 2N ) by measuring X0 and Y0 , since hX0 i = 2Re\u03c11,d and hY0 i =\n2Im\u03c11,d (cf. (6.62)). Following the method of G\u00fchne et al. [2007], these matrix\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n157\n\nelements can be obtained from two settings Ml and M\u0303l , given by\n\u0001\u2297N\nl\u03c0\nl\u03c0\n, l = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\n)\u03c3x + sin( )\u03c3y\nN\nN\n\u0001\u2297N\nl\u03c0 + \u03c0/2\nl\u03c0 + \u03c0/2\n, l = 1, 2, . . . , N.\n)\u03c3x + sin(\n)\u03c3y\nM\u0303l = cos(\nN\nN\n\nMl = cos(\n\n(6.76)\n(6.77)\n\nThese operators obey:\n\nN\nX\n\n(N )\n\n(\u22121)l Ml = N X0\n\n,\n\n(6.78)\n\n.\n\n(6.79)\n\nl=1\n\nN\nX\n\n(N )\n\n(\u22121)l M\u0303l = N Y0\n\nl=1\n\nThe proof of (6.78) is given by [G\u00fchne et al., 2007] and (6.79) can be proven in the\nsame way.\nThese relations show that the imaginary and the real part of an anti-diagonal\nelement can be determined by the N settings Ml and M\u0303l respectively. This implies\nthat the bi-separability condition (6.68) needs only 2N + 1 measurement settings.\nHowever, if each anti-diagonal term is real valued (which is often the case for states\nof interest) it can be determined by the N settings Ml , so that in total N +1 settings\nsuffice.\nImplementation of the criteria for other x involves determining the modulus of\nsome other anti-diagonal matrix element instead of the far-off anti-diagonal element\n\u03c11,d . The settings that allow for this determination can be obtained from a local\nunitary rotation on the settings Ml and M\u0303l needed to measure |\u03c11,d |. This can be\ndone as follows.\nSuppose we want to determine the modulus of the matrix element \u03c1j,\uf6be\u0304 . The\nunitary rotation to be applied is given by Uj = \u03c3j1 \u2297 \u03c3j2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c3jN with j =\nj1 j2 . . . jN in binary notation, with \u03c30 = 1 and \u03c31 = \u03c3x . The settings that suffice\nare then given by Mj,l = Uj Ml Uj\u2020 and M\u0303j,l = Uj M\u0303l Uj\u2020 (l = 1, 2, . . . , N ). For\nexample, take N = 4 and suppose we want to determine \u03c15,4 . We obtain the\nrequired settings by applying the local unitary U5 = 1 \u2297 \u03c3x \u2297 1 \u2297 \u03c3x (since the\nbinary notation of 5 on four bits is 0101) to the two settings Ml and M\u0303l given\nin (6.76) and (6.79) respectively that for N = 4 allow for determining |\u03c11,16 |. In\nconclusion, using the above procedure the modulus of each anti-diagonal element\ncan be determined using 2N settings, and in case they are real (or imaginary) N\nsettings suffice.\nSince the strongest separability inequality for the specific target state under\nconsideration is chosen, this reduction in the number of settings does not reduce the\nnoise robustness for detecting forms of entanglement as compared to that obtained\n(N )\nusing the entanglement criteria in terms of the usual settings Xx , etc.\nIn conclusion, if the state to be detected is known, the 2N settings of (6.76) and\n(6.77) together with the single setting \u03c3z\u2297N suffice, and in case this state has solely\n\n\f158\n\nChapter 6\n\nreal or imaginary anti-diagonal matrix elements only N + 1 settings are needed.\nThe white noise robustness using these settings is just as great as using the general\n(N )\n(N )\ncondition that use the observables Xx and Yx , and is found by solving (6.74)\nor (6.75) for detecting full and some entanglement respectively.\nAs a final note, we observe that in order to determine the modulus of not just one\nbut of all anti-diagonal matrix elements it is more efficient to use the observables\n(N )\n(N )\nXx , Yx\nthan the observables of (6.76) and (6.77). The first method needs\nN\n2 settings to do this and the second needs 2N N/2 settings (since there are 2N /2\nindependent anti-diagonal elements), i.e., the latter needs more settings than the\nformer for all N .\nLet us apply the above procedure to an example, taken from G\u00fchne et al. [2007],\nthe so-called four-qubit singlet state, which is given by:\n\u221a\n1\n(6.80)\n| \u03a64 i = (| 0011i + | 1100i \u2212 (| 01i + | 10i) \u2297 (| 01i + | 10i))/ 3.\n2\nFor detecting it as fully entangled (6.74) gives a noise robustness p0 = 12/29 \u2248 0.41,\nand for detecting it as entangled (6.75) gives a noise robustness of 16/19 \u2248 0.84.\nThe implementation needs 16 + 1 = 17 settings.\nThis number of settings can be reduced by using the fact that this state has\nonly real anti-diagonal matrix elements and that we need only look at the largest\nanti-diagonal element. As shown above, this matrix element can be measured in\n4 settings. Thus the total number of settings required is reduced to only 5. The\noff-diagonal matrix element to be determined is | 0011ih 1100|. The four settings\nthat allow for this determination are obtained from the four settings given in (6.76)\nby applying the unitary operator U3 = 1 \u2297 1 \u2297 \u03c3x \u2297 \u03c3x to these settings.\nFor comparison, note that G\u00fchne et al. [2007] showed that the projector-based\nwitness for the state (6.80) detects full entanglement with a white noise robustness\np0 = 0.267 and uses 15 settings, whereas the optimal witness from G\u00fchne et al.\n[2007] uses only 3 settings and has p0 = 0.317. Here we obtain p0 \u2248 0.41 using\n5 settings, implying a significant increase in white noise robustness using only two\nsettings more.\nThis example gives the largest noise robustness when the conditions are measured in the standard z-basis. However, sometimes one obtains larger noise robustness when the state is first rotated so as to be expressed in a different basis\nbefore it is analyzed. For example, consider the four qubit Dicke state | 2, 4i, where\n\u0001\u22121/2 P\n| l, N i = Nl\nk \u03c0k (| 11 , . . . , 1l , 0l+1 , . . . , 0N i) are the symmetric Dicke states\n[Dicke, 1954] (with {\u03c0k (*)} the set of all distinct permutations of the N qubits).\nIn the standard basis this state does not violate any of the separability conditions\nwe have discussed above. However, if each qubit is rotated around the x-axis by\n90 degrees all of the separability conditions can be violated with quite high noise\nrobustness. Indeed, it is detected as inseparable under all splits through violation\nof conditions (6.51) for p < p0 = 16/19 \u2248 0.84 and as fully entangled through\nviolation of condition (6.53) for p < p0 = 4/11 \u2248 0.36 using 5 settings. For comparison, Chen and Chen [2007] used specially constructed entanglement witnesses for\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n159\n\ndetection of full entanglement in these states, and they obtained as noise robustness\np0 = 2/9 \u2248 0.22 using only 2 settings. We have not performed an optimization procedure, so it is unclear whether or not the values obtained for p0 can be improved.\n\n6.4.2\n\nNoise and decoherence robustness for the N-qubit GHZ\nstate\n\nIn this subsection we determine the robustness of our separability criteria for detecting the N -qubit GHZ state in five kinds of noise processes (admixing white\nand colored noise, and three types of decoherence: depolarization, dephasing and\ndissipation of single qubits). We give the noise robustness as a function of N for\ndetecting some entanglement, inseparability with respect to all splits and full entanglement. We compare the results for white noise robustness of the criteria for\nfull entanglement to that of the fidelity criterion (6.10) and to that of the so called\nstabilizer criteria of T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne [2005a,b].\n\u221a1 (| 0i\u2297N + | 1i\u2297N ) can be transformed\nThe N -qubit GHZ state | \u03a8N\nGHZ,0 i =\n2\ninto a mixed state \u03c1N by admixing noise to this state or by decoherence.

In other words, we determine the noise (or decoherence)\n(v)\n(i)\nrobustness of violations of all these conditions for \u03c1N to \u03c1N . We find the following\nthreshold values p0 .\n1\n,\n1 + 2(1\u2212N )\n(ii) p0 = 1, \u2200N,\n(i) p0 =\n\n(iii) (1 \u2212 p0 )N = (1 \u2212\n(iv) p0 = 1,\n(v) p0 = 1,\n\np0 \u03b1 p0 (N \u2212\u03b1)\np0\np0\n) ( )\n+ (1 \u2212 )(N \u2212\u03b1) ( )\u03b1 ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(6.86)\n\n\u2200N,\n\n\u2200N.\n\nFor cases (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) the threshold values p0 for detecting some entanglement and inseparability with respect to all splits are the same because for these\ncases the product of the diagonal matrix elements \u03c1j,j \u03c1j\u0304,j\u0304 is the same for all j 6= 1, d.\nOnly in case (iii) is this product different for different j. We then have to take the\nminimum and maximum value, respectively, from which it follows that \u03b1 is to be\nset to [N/2] for detecting some entanglement and to 1 for detecting inseparability\nwith respect to all splits. Here [N/2] is the largest integer smaller or equal to N/2.\nThe result in case (i) is in accordance with the results of [D\u00fcr and Cirac, 2000;\nD\u00fcr et al., 1999], where it is furthermore shown that the opposite holds as well, i.e.,\n(i)\niff p < 1/(1 + 2(1\u2212N ) ) then \u03c1N is inseparable under any split and otherwise it is\nfully separable. Thus all states of the form (6.81) that are inseparable under any\nsplit are detected by violations of the conditions of the form (6.51) for all bi-partite\n(v)\n(iv)\n(ii)\nsplits. The same holds for cases (ii), (iv) and (v), since all states \u03c1N , \u03c1N and \u03c1N\nare inseparable under any split for all p < 1. In other words, as soon as a fraction\nof the GHZ state is present, these states are inseparable under any split. In case\n(i) p0 increases monotonically from p0 = 2/3 for N = 2 to p0 = 1 for \u221a\nlarge N . For\n3)/3 \u2248 0.42\nprocess (iii) these limiting values\nare\nnot\nso\nstraightforward:\np\n=\n(3\u2212\n0\n\u221a\nfor N = 2, and p0 = (5 \u2212 5)/5 \u2248 0.55 for large N . In conclusion, the noise and\ndecoherence robustness is high for all N , except maybe for case (iii).\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n161\n\nNext, consider the noise robustness for detecting full entanglement by means of\nthe bi-separability condition (6.53). The result is the following:\n(i)\n\np0 = 1/(2(1 \u2212 2\u2212N )),\n\n(ii) p0 = 1,\n\n\u2200N,\n\n(iii) p0 \u2248 0.42, 0.28, 0.22, 0.18, N = 2, 3, 4, 5.\n(iv) p0 = 1,\n\n(6.87)\n\n\u2200N,\n\n(v) p0 \u2248 1, 0.48, 0.39, 0.35, N = 2, 3, 4, 5.\nFor case (i) the noise robustness is equivalent to the fidelity criterion (6.10). For\nlarge N p0 decreases to the limit value p0 = 1/2. Case (ii) and (iv) have p0 = 1,\n(ii)\n(iv)\nthus as soon as the states \u03c1N and \u03c1N are entangled they are fully entangled. For\ncases (iii) and (v) we listed the noise robustness found numerically for N = 2 to\nN = 5. These values decrease for increasing N .\nLet us compare the results for white noise robustness (case (i)) to the results\nobtained from the so-called stabilizer formalism [Gottesman, 1996]. This formalism\nis used by T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne [2005a,b] to derive entanglement witnesses that are\nespecially useful for minimizing the number of settings required to detect either\nfull or some entanglement. Here we will only consider the criteria formulated for\ndetecting entanglement of the N -qubit GHZ states. The stabilizer witness by T\u00f3th\n& G\u00fchne that detects some entanglement has p0 = 2/3, independent of N , and\nrequires only three settings (cf. Eq. (13) in [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a]). The strongest\nwitness for full entanglement of T\u00f3th & G\u00fchne has a robustness p0 = 1/(3\u22122(2\u2212N ))\nand requires only two settings (cf. Eq. (23) in [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a]).\nFigure 6.3 shows these threshold noise ratios for detecting full entanglement for\nthese three criteria. Note that the criterion of [T\u00f3th and G\u00fchne, 2005a] needs only\ntwo measurement settings, whereas our criteria need N + 1 settings. So although\nthe former are less robust against white noise admixture, they compare favorably\nwith respect to minimizing the number of measurement settings.\nAlthough we give a criterion for full entanglement that is generally stronger than\nthe fidelity criterion, for the N -partite GHZ state this does not lead to better noise\nrobustness. It appears that for large N the noise threshold p0 = 1/2 is the best\none can do. However, in the limit of large N the GHZ state is inseparable under all\nsplits for all p0 < 1, as was shown in (i) in (6.86). See also Figure 6.3.\n(i)\nWe have seen that if the state \u03c1N is entangled it is also inseparable under any\nsplit. Because of the high symmetry of both the GHZ state and white noise, one\nmight conjecture that if this state is entangled it is also fully entangled. At present,\n(i)\nhowever it is unknown whether this is indeed true. Detecting the states \u03c1N as\nfully entangled appears to be a much more demanding task than detecting them as\ninseparable under all splits. In the first case, for large N , only a fraction of 50%\nnoise is permitted, in the second case one can permit any noise fraction (less than\n100%). Note that we have given explicit examples of states that are diagonal in the\n\n\f162\n\nChapter 6\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\ns\nr\n\ns\nr\n\ns\nr\n\ns\nr\n\ns\nr\n\ns\nr\n\n2\n3\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n1\n\n+\n\nGHZ basis (cf.

(6.13)), a feature which is not\npossible using linear entanglement witnesses.

The noise\nrobustness for detecting inseparability under all splits as given in (i) in (6.86) is also\nplotted (crosses).\n\n6.4.3\n\nDetecting bound entanglement for N \u2265 3\n\nViolation of the separability inequality (6.59) allows for detecting all bound entangled states of D\u00fcr [2001b]. These states have the form\n!\nN\n1X\n1\nN\nN\n| \u03a8GHZ,\u03b1 ih \u03a8GHZ,\u03b1 | +\n(6.88)\nPl + P\u0304l ,\n\u03c1B =\nN +1\n2\nl=1\n\nwith Pl the projector on the state | 0i1 . . . | 1il . . . | 0iN , and where P\u0304l is obtained from\nPl by replacing all zeros by ones and vice versa. For N \u2265 4 these states are entangled\nand have positive partial transposition (PPT) with respect to transposition of any\nqubit. This means they are bound entangled [Horodecki et al., 1998]. Note that\nthey are detected as entangled by the N -partite Mermin inequality |MN | \u2264 2 of\nsection 6.3.3 only for N \u2265 8 [D\u00fcr, 2001b]. However, the condition (6.59) detects\nthem as entangled for N \u2265 4. Thus all bound entangled states of this form are\ndetected as entangled by this latter condition. The white noise robustness for this\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n163\n\npurpose is p0 = 2N /(2 + 2N + 2N ), which for N = 4 gives p0 = 8/13 \u2248 0.615 and\ngoes to 1 for large N . Note that for N = 4, this state violates the condition for\n4-separability, and the condition for 3-separability (6.61), but not the condition for\n2-separability. It is thus at least 2-separable entangled. It is not detected as fully\nentangled by these criteria. (Of course, it could still be fully entangled since these\ncriteria are only sufficient and not necessary for entanglement). For general N we\nhave not investigated the k-separable entanglement of the states (6.88), although\nthis can be readily performed using the criteria of (6.61).\nAnother interesting bound entangled state is the so-called four qubit Smolin\nstate [Smolin, 2001]\n4\n\n\u03c1S =\n\n1X j\n| \u03a8 ih \u03a8jab | \u2297 | \u03a8jcd ih \u03a8jcd |,\n4 j=1 ab\n\n(6.89)\n\nwhere {| \u03a8j i} is the set of four Bell states {| \u03c6\u00b1 i, | \u03c8 \u00b1 i}, and a, b, c, d label the\nfour qubits. This state is also detected as entangled by the criterion (6.59), and\nwith white noise robustness p0 = 2/3. The Smolin state violates the separability\nconditions (6.51) for bi-separability under the splits a-(bcd), b-(acd), c-(abd), d(abc). However, it is separable under the splits (ab)-(cd), (ac)-(bd), (ad)-(bc) (cf.\n[Smolin, 2001]). This state is thus inseparable under splits that partition the system\ninto two subsets with one and three qubits, but it is separable when each subset\ncontains two qubits.\nSo far we have detected bound entanglement for N \u2265 4. What about N = 3?\nConsider the three-qubit bound entangled state of D\u00fcr and Cirac [2001]:\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n1 3\n|\u03a8\nih \u03a83GHZ,0 | + (| 001ih 001| + | 010ih 010| + | 101ih 101| + | 110ih 110|).\n3 GHZ,0\n6\n(6.90)\n\nThis state is detected as entangled by the criterion (6.34), with white noise robustness p0 = 4/7 \u2248 0.57. It violates the bi-separability condition (6.27) for the split\na-(bc) so it is at least bi-separable entangled, but does not violate the condition\n(6.33) for bi-separability i.e., it is not detected as fully entangled. In fact, it can be\nshown using the results of D\u00fcr et al. [1999] that this state is separable under the\nsplits b-(ac) and c-(ab).\n\n6.5\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have discussed partial separability of quantum states by distinguishing k-separability from \u03b1k -separability and used these distinctions to extend the classification\nproposed by D\u00fcr and Cirac. We discussed the relationship of partial separability to\nmulti-partite entanglement and distinguished the notions of a k-separable entangled\nstate and a m-partite entangled state and indicated the interrelations of these kinds\nof entanglement.\n\n\f164\n\nChapter 6\n\nNext, we have presented necessary conditions for partial separability in the hierarchic separability classification. These are formulated in terms of experimentally\naccessible correlation inequalities for operators defined by products of local orthogonal observables. Violations of these inequalities provide, for all N -qubit states,\ncriteria for the entire hierarchy of k-separable entanglement, ranging from the levels k=1 (full or genuine N -particle entanglement) to k = N (full separability, no\nentanglement), as well as for specific classes within each level. Choosing the Pauli\nmatrices as the locally orthogonal observables provided matrix representations of\nthe criteria that bound anti-diagonal matrix elements in terms of diagonal ones.\nFurther, the N -qubit Mermin-type separability inequalities for partial separability were shown to follow from the partial separability conditions derived in this chapter. The bi-separability conditions are stronger than the fidelity criterion and the\nLaskowski-\u017bukowski criterion, and the latter criterion is also shown to be strengthened for full separability and biseparability. For separability under splits the conditions are stronger than the D\u00fcr-Cirac conditions. Violation of these conditions\nthus give entanglement criteria that detect more entangled states than violations of\nthese three other separability conditions.\nWe have furthermore shown that the required number of measurement settings\nfor implementation of these criteria, which is 2N + 1 in general, can be drastically\nreduced if entanglement of a given target state is to be detected. In that case, it\nmay be reduced to 2N + 1, and for multi-qubit states with either real or imaginary\nanti-diagonal matrix elements, only N + 1 settings are needed.\nWhen comparing the entanglement criteria to other state-specific multi-qubit\nentanglement criteria it was found that the white noise robustness was high for a\ngreat variety of interesting multi-qubit states, whereas the number of required settings was only N + 1. However, these other state-specific entanglement criteria need\nless settings although for the states analyzed here they give lower noise robustness.\nAnalyzing some specific target states shows that the entanglement criteria detect\nbound entanglement for N \u2265 3.\nFurthermore, we applied the entanglement criteria for some and full entanglement to the N -qubit GHZ state subjected to two different kinds of noise and three\ndifferent kinds of decoherence. The robustness against colored noise and against\ndephasing turns out to be maximal (i.e., p0 = 1) both for detecting some and full\nentanglement. It is remarkable that for large N the GHZ state allows for maximal white noise robustness for the state to remain inseparable under all possible\nsplits, whereas for detecting full entanglement the best known result \u2013 to our best\nknowledge \u2013 only allows for a white noise robustness of p0 = 1/2. It would be very\ninteresting to search for full entanglement criteria that can close this gap, or if this\nis shown to be impossible to understand why this is the case.\nOrthogonality of the local observables is crucial in the above derivation of separability conditions. It is due to this assumption that the multi-qubit operators form\nrepresentations of the generalized Pauli group. It would be interesting to analyze\nthe role of orthogonality in deriving the inequalities. For two qubits it has been\n\n\fPartial separability and multi-partite entanglement\n\n165\n\nshown by Seevinck and Uffink [2007], see chapter 5, that when orthogonality is relaxed the separability conditions become less strong, and we conjecture the same\nholds for their multi-qubit analogs. Relaxing the requirement of orthogonality has\nthe advantage that some uncertainty in the angles may be accommodated, which is\ndesirable since in real experiments it may be hard to measure perfectly orthogonal\nobservables.\nIt is also interesting that the separability inequalities are equivalent to bounds\non anti-diagonal matrix elements in terms of products of diagonal ones. We thus\ngain a new perspective on why they allow for entanglement detection: they probe\nthe values of anti-diagonal matrix elements, which encode entanglement information about the state; and if these elements are large enough, this entanglement\nis detected. Note furthermore that compared to the Mermin-type separability inequalities we need not do much more to obtain our stronger inequalities. We must\nsolely determine some diagonal matrix elements, and this can be easily performed\nusing the single extra setting \u03c3z\u2297N .\nOur recursive definition of the multi-partite correlation operators (see (6.49)) is\nby no means unique. One can generate many new inequalities by choosing the locally\northogonal observables differently, e.g., by permuting their order in each triple of\nlocal observables. It could well be that combining such new inequalities with those\npresented here yield even stronger separability conditions, as is indeed the case for\npure two-qubit states [Uffink and Seevinck, 2008], see chapter 4. Unfortunately, we\nhave no conclusive answers for this open question.\nWe end by suggesting three further lines of future research. Firstly, it would be\ninteresting to apply the entanglement criteria to an even larger variety of N -qubit\nstates than analyzed here, including for example all N -qubit graph and Dicke states.\nSecondly, the generalization from qubits to qudits (i.e., d-dimensional quantum\nsystems) would, if indeed possible, prove very useful since strong partial separability\ncriteria for N qudits have \u2013 to our knowledge \u2013 not yet been obtained. And finally,\nit would be beneficial to have optimization procedures for choosing the set of local\northogonal observables featuring in the entanglement criteria that gives the highest\nnoise robustness for a given set of states. We believe we have chosen such optimal\nsets for the variety of states analyzed here, but since no rigorous optimization was\nperformed, our choices could perhaps be improved.\nTo end this chapter we comment on the noteworthy result that the Mermin-type\nseparability inequalities show that the strength of the correlations in separable qubit\nstates is exponentially decreasing when compared to the strength of the correlations\nallowed for by LHV models. From a more fundamental point of view it is quite\nremarkable that the strengthened Bell-type inequalities which were shown to hold\nfor separable qubit states, do not hold for LHV theories, for which the Bell-type\ninequalities were originally designed. This shows that the latter theories are able to\ngive correlations for which quantum mechanics, in order to reproduce them using\nqubit states, needs recourse to entangled states; and even more and more so when\nthe number of particles increases.\n\n\f166\n\nChapter 6\n\nAssuming that the LHV doctrine is a necessary ingredient for the notion of classicality, the idea that it is the separable qubit states which are the classical states\namong all qubit states needs revision. Although Werner [1989] was the first to point\nto this, we here show a much more radical and general departure, especially when the\nnumber of qubits grows. Of course, if more general measurement scenarios than the\nstandard Bell experiment setup are allowed things might change. Given the surprising results found here between separability of qubit states and local hidden-variable\nstructures, the question what is exactly the classical part of quantum mechanics\nseems to still be not fully answered and open for new investigations.\nHowever, it should be mentioned that, just as was the case in chapter 4 for the\ntwo-qubit separability inequalities, these findings hold only for the case of qubits. By\nchoosing the Hilbert space of the systems under consideration to be large enough\nany choice of observables can be made commuting8 . Using separable states of a\nsystem consisting of such systems one can, after all, reproduce the predictions of all\nLHV models.\nThus one may take an experimental violation of the Mermin-type separability\ninequalities by N -qubits to mean two things: (i) either one can conclude that the\nstate of the N -qubits is entangled, or (ii) the state might be separable but then one\nis not dealing with qubits after all and some degrees of freedom must have been\noverlooked.\n\n8 This is is easily obtained by generalizing the argument given in section 4.3 from two to N\nqubits.\n\n\fChapter 7\n\n167\n\nMonogamy of correlations\nThis chapter is in part based on Seevinck [2007a].\n\n7.1\n\nIntroduction to the monogamy of entanglement\nand of correlations\n\nIf a pure quantum state of two systems is entangled, then none of the two systems\ncan be entangled with a third system. This can be easily seen. Suppose that systems\na and b are in a pure entangled state. Then when the system ab is considered as\npart of a larger system, the reduced density operator for ab must by assumption be\na pure state. However, for the composite system ab (or for any of its subsystems a\nor b) to be entangled with another system, the reduced density operator of ab must\nbe a mixed state. But since it is by assumption pure, no entanglement between ab\nand any other system can exist. This feature is referred to as the monogamy of\npure state entanglement1 .\nThis monogamy can also be understood as a consequence of the linearity of\nquantum mechanics that is also responsible for the no-cloning theorem. For suppose\nthat party2 a has a qubit which is maximally pure state entangled to both a qubit\nheld by party b and a qubit held by party c. Party a thus has a single qubit\ncoupled to two perfect entangled quantum channels, which this party could exploit\nto teleport two perfect copies of an unknown input state, thereby violating the\nno-cloning theorem, and thus the linearity of quantum mechanics [Terhal, 2004].\n1 This\n\nis sometimes confusingly referred to as the claim that in quantum theory a system can\nbe pure state entangled\n\u221a with only one other system [Spekkens, 2004]. But what about the GHZ\nstate (| 000i + | 111i)/ 2 ? All three parties are entangled to each other in this pure state, so this\nseems to be a counterexample to the claim. What is actually meant is that if a pure state of two\nsystems is entangled, then none of the two systems can be entangled with a third system. This is\nthe formulation we will use.\n2 For ease of notation we will use the same symbols to refer to parties and the systems they\npossess, e.g., party a possesses system a.\n\n\f168\n\nChapter 7\n\nIf the state of two systems is not a pure entangled state but a mixed entangled\nstate, then it is possible that both of the two systems are entangled\nto a third\n\u221a\nsystem. For example, the W -state | \u03c8i = (| 001i + | 010i + | 100i)/ 3 has bi-partite\nreduced states that are all identical and entangled. This feature is called 'sharing\nof mixed state entanglement', or 'promiscuity of entanglement'. So we see that\nentanglement is strictly speaking only monogamous in the case of pure entangled\nstates. In the case of mixed entangled states it can be promiscuous. But this\npromiscuity is not unbounded: although some entangled bi-partite states may be\nshareable with some finite number of parties, no entangled bi-partite state can be\nshared with an infinite number of parties3 . Here a bi-partite state \u03c1ab is said to\nbe N -shareable when it is possible to find a quantum state \u03c1ab1 b2 ...bN such that\n\u03c1ab = \u03c1ab1 = \u03c1ab2 = . . . = \u03c1abN , where \u03c1abk is the reduced state for parties a and\nbk . Consider the following theorem [Fannes et al., 1988; Raggio and Werner, 1989]:\nA bi-partite state is N -shareable for all N (also called \u221e-shareable [Masanes et\nal., 2006]) iff it is separable. Thus no bi-partite entangled state, pure or mixed, is\nN -shareable for all N .\nThe monogamy of entanglement was first quantified by Coffman, Kundu and\nWootters [2000] who gave a trade-off relation between how entangled a is with b, and\nhow entangled a is with c in a three-qubit system abc that is in a pure state, using the\nmeasure of bi-partite entanglement called the tangle [Osborne and Verstraete, 2006].\nIt states that \u03c4 (\u03c1ab ) + \u03c4 (\u03c1ac ) \u2264 \u03c4 (\u03c1a(bc) ) where \u03c4 (\u03c1ab ) is the tangle4 between A and\nB, analogous for \u03c4 (\u03c1ac ) and \u03c4 (\u03c1a(bc) ) is the bi-partite entanglement5 across the split\na-(bc). The multi-partite generalization has been recently proven by Osborne and\nVerstraete [2006]. In general, \u03c4 can vary between 0 and 1, but monogamy constrains\nthe entanglement (as quantified by \u03c4 ) that party a can have with each of parties b\nand c.\nClassically one does not have such a trade-off. All classical probability distributions can be shared [Toner, 2006]. If parties a, b and c have bits instead of quantum\nbits (qubits) and if a's bit is always the same as b's bit then there is no restriction\non how a's bit is correlated to c's bit.\nLet us however not just look at entanglement but also at correlations that result\nfrom making local measurements on quantum systems. As we have seen many\ntimes already, these correlations can violate Bell-type inequalities that hold for\nlocal hidden-variable models. Such Bell-type inequality violating correlations turn\nout to be monogamous. This is termed 'monogamy of quantum non-locality' or\n'non-local correlations are monogamous'.\nLet us show this in a setup where each party implements two possible dichoto3 This is also referred to as 'monogamy in an asymptotic sense' by Terhal [2004], but we believe\nthat this feature is better captured by the term 'no unbounded promiscuity'\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4 The tangle \u03c4 (\u03c1 ) is the square of the concurrence C(\u03c1 ) := max{0, \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb },\n1\n2\n3\n4\nab\nab\n\u2217\nwhere the \u03bbi are the eigenvalues of the matrix \u03c1ab (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1ab (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ) in non-decreasing order,\nwith \u03c3y the Pauli-spin matrix for the y-direction.\n5 In case of three qubits the tangle \u03c4 (\u03c1\na(bc) ) is equal to 4 det\u03c1a , with \u03c1a = Trbc [| \u03c8ih \u03c8|] and\n| \u03c8i the pure three-qubit state.\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n169\n\nmous observables. The CHSH inequality is the only non-trivial local Bell-type\ninequality for this setup. All quantum correlations that violate this inequality are\nmonogamous as follows from the following tight trade-off inequality for a threepartite system abc proven by Toner and Verstraete [2006]:\nhBab i2qm + hBac i2qm \u2264 8,\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere Bab is the CHSH operator (4.1) for parties a and b, and analogous for Bac .\n\nhBac i\n4\n\u221a\n2 2\n2\n\u221a\n2\n\nhBab i\n\nFigure 7.1: Monogamy of quantum and no-signaling correlations. All quantum correlations\nlie within the circle, and all no-signaling correlations lie within the tilted larger square. For\ncomparison the classical correlations are also shown. These lie within the square with edge\nlength 2. The correlations obtainable by orthogonal measurements on separable two-qubit\nstates lie within the smallest square.\n\nQuantum correlations thus show an interesting trade-off relationship: In case the\ncorrelations between party a and b are non-local (i.e., when |hBab iqm | > 2) the correlations between parties a and c cannot be non-local (i.e., necessarily |hBac iqm | \u2264 2),\nand vice versa (cf. Scarani and Gisin [2001]). These non-local quantum correlations\ncan thus not \u221a\nbe shared. Furthermore, in case they are maximally non-local, i.e.,\n|hBab iqm | = 2 2 the other must be uncorrelated, i.e., it must be that |hBac iqm | = 0,\nand vice versa. Here it is crucial that the measurements performed by party a are\nthe same in both expressions.\nThis trade-off relation is plotted in Figure 7.1. It provides a non-trivial bound on\nthe set of quantum correlations because a three-partite system abc cannot simultaneously violate the CHSH inequality for correlations between ab (summing over c's\noutcomes) and between ac (summing over c's outcomes). Both general unrestricted\nand local correlations do not obey such a monogamy trade-off. The first type can\n\n\f170\n\nChapter 7\n\nreach the absolute maxima |Bab |max = |Bac |max = 4, and the second type can attain\nthe maximal value for local correlations, i.e, hBab ilhv = hBac ilhv = 2.\nThe reason for this is that general unrestricted correlations and local correlations\ncan be shared. The latter fact is proven by Masanes et al. [2006] and the first\nwe will prove here. However, first we need the relevant definitions. Shareability\nof a general unrestricted probability distribution is defined as follows (where for\nsimplicity we restrict ourselves to shareability of bi-partite distributions). A bipartite distribution P (a, b1 |A, B1 , . . . , BN ) is N -shareable with respect to the second\nparty if an (N + 1)-partite distribution P (a, b1 , . . . , bN |A, B1 , . . . , BN ) exists that\nis symmetric with respect to (b1 , B1 ), (b2 , B2 ), . . . , (bN , BN ) and with marginals\nP (a, bi |A, B1 , . . . , BN ) equal to the original distribution P (a, b1 |A, B1 , . . . , BN ), for\nall i. For notational clarity we use bi and Bi (instead of ai and Ai ) to denote\noutcomes and observables respectively for the parties other than the first party. If\na distribution is shareable for all N it is called \u221e-shareable.\nShareability of a no-signaling probability distribution is defined analogously: A\nno-signaling distribution P (a, b1 |A, B1 ) is N -shareable with respect to the second\nparty if there exist an (N + 1)-partite distribution P (a, b1 , . . . , bN |A, B1 , . . . , BN )\nbeing symmetric with respect to (b1 , B1 ), (b2 , B2 ), . . . , (bN , BN ) with marginals\nP (a, bi |A, Bi ) equal to the original distribution P (a, b1 |A, B1 ), for all i. The difference between shareability of unrestricted correlations and of no-signaling correlations is that in the first case the marginals depend on all N + 1 settings, whereas\nin the latter case they only depend on the two settings A and Bi .\nSuppose we are given a general unrestricted correlation P (a, b1 |A, B1 , . . . , BN ).\nWe can then construct\nP (a, b1 , . . . , bN |A, B1 , . . . , BN ) = P (a, b1 |A, B1 , . . . , BN )\u03b4b1 ,b2 * * * \u03b4b1 ,bN ,\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhich has by construction the same marginals P (a, bi |A, B1 , . . . , BN ) equal to the\noriginal distribution P (a, b1 |A, B1 , . . . , BN ). This holds for all i, thereby proving\nthe \u221e-shareability. Thus an unrestricted correlation can be shared for all N . If\nwe restrict the distributions to be no-signaling, Masanes et al. [2006] proved that\n\u221e-shareability implies that the distribution is local, i.e., it can be written as\nZ\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)P (a|A, \u03bb)P (b1 |B1 , \u03bb) * * * P (bN |BN , \u03bb),\nP (a, b1 , . . . , bN )|A, B1 . . . , BN ) =\n\u039b\n\n(7.3)\n\nfor some local distributions P (a|A, \u03bb), P (b1 |B1 , \u03bb), . . . , P (bN |BN , \u03bb) and hiddenvariable distribution p(\u03bb).\nBecause general unrestricted correlations and local ones can be shared they\nboth will not show any monogamy. This implies that partially-local correlations\nalso do not show any monogamy, since these are combinations of local and general\nunrestricted correlations between subsystems of the N -systems.\nThe above result by Masanes et al. [2006] shows that quantum and no-signaling\ncorrelations can not be \u221e-shareable and they must therefore show monogamy effects. Monogamy of quantum correlations has already been shown above via the\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n171\n\ntrade-off relation (7.1), so let us move to no-signaling correlations. First consider\na very strong monogamy property for extremal no-signaling correlations, already\nmentioned by Barrett et al. [2005]. Suppose one has some no-signaling three-party\nprobability distribution P (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) for parties a, b and c. In case the\nmarginal distribution P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) of system ab is extremal then it cannot be\ncorrelated to the third system c, as the following proof by Barrett et al. [2005]\nshows.\nBayes' rule and no-signaling give\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) = P (a1 , a2 , |A1 , A2 , A3 , a3 )P (a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 )\n= P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 , A3 , a3 )P (a3 |A3 ).\n\n(7.4)\n\nTherefore the marginal P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) can be rewritten as\nX\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 )\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) =\na3\n\n=\n\nX\na3\n\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 , A3 , a3 )P (a3 |A3 ), \u2200A3 .\n\n(7.5)\n\nSince by supposition P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) is extremal the decomposition is unique, this\ngives\nP (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 , A3 , a3 ) = P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ), \u2200a3 , A3 . Then combining all this gives:\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) = P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 )P (a3 |A3 ),\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhich implies that party c is completely uncorrelated with party ab: the extremal\ncorrelation P (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 ) is completely monogamous. Note that this implies that\nall local Bell-type inequalities for which the maximal violation consistent with nosignaling is attained by a unique correlation have monogamy constraints. This\nfollows because all Bell-type inequalities are linear in the correlations, therefore,\nif the maximal violation is produced by a unique correlation, it can only be produced by an extreme point of the no-signaling polytope. Otherwise the correlation\nthat produces maximal violation would not be unique. An example is the CHSH\ninequality, as will be shown below.\nExtremal no-signaling correlations thus show monogamy, but what about nonextremal no-signaling correlations? Just as was the case for quantum states where\nnon-extremal (mixed state) entanglement can be shared, non-extremal no-signaling\ncorrelations can be shared as well. This can be seen from the fact that no-signaling\ncorrelations obey the following tight trade-off relation in terms of the CHSH operators [Toner, 2006]:\n|hBab ins | + |hBac ins | \u2264 4.\n\n(7.7)\n\nThis is also depicted in Figure 7.1. Extremal no-signaling correlations can attain\n|hBab ins | = 4 so that necessarily |hBac ins | = 0, and vice versa (this is monogamy of\nextremal no-signaling correlations), whereas non-extremal ones are shareable since\n\n\f172\n\nChapter 7\n\nthe correlation terms |hBab ins | and |hBac ins | can both be non-zero at the same time.\nBut note that in case the no-signaling correlations are non-local they can not be\nshared, i.e., it is not possible that |hBab ins | \u2265 2 and |hBac ins | \u2265 2. This shows that\nif these non-local correlations can be shared they must be signaling.\nFor general unrestricted correlations no monogamy holds, i.e., |hBab i| and |hBac i|\nare not mutually constrained and can each obtain a value of 4 so as to give the absolute maximum of the left hand side of (7.7) which is the value 8. The monogamy\nbound (7.7) therefore gives a way of discriminating no-signaling from general correlations: if it is violated the correlations cannot be no-signaling (i.e., they must be\nsignaling). This discerning inequality uses product expectation values only, in contrast to the facets of the no-signaling polytope that only give non-trivial constrains\non the marginal expectation values, as was discussed in chapter 2, section 2.3.1.1.\nFor classical correlations no such trade-off as in (7.1) or as in (7.7) holds. Indeed,\nit is possible to have both |hBab ilhv | = 2 and |hBac ilhv | = 2, see also Figure 7.1. This\nreflects the fact that classical correlations are always shareable. The correlations\nthat separable quantum states allow for are also shareable. Indeed, in the hBab iqm hBac iqm plane of Figure 7.1 such correlations can reach the full square with edge\nlength 2. Analogous to what we have seen in chapter 5, it is the case that when\nconsidering qubits and measurements that are restricted to orthogonal ones only one\nobtains tighter bounds. These restrict the possible values \u221a\nof hBab iqm and hBac iqm\nto the smallest square of Figure 7.1: |hBab iqm |, |hBac iqm | \u2264 2, \u03c1 \u2208 Dsep . But again\nthere is no monogamy for separable states in this case since this full square can be\nreached.\n\n7.1.1\n\nA stronger monogamy relation for the non-locality of\nbi-partite quantum correlations\n\nWe will now give an alternative simpler proof of the inequality (7.1) that also allows\nus to strengthen it as well. The proof uses the idea that (7.1), which describes the\ninterior of a circle in the hBab i-hBac i plane, is equivalent to the interior of the set\nof tangents to this circle. It is thus a compact way of writing the following infinite\nset of linear equalities\n\u221a\nS = maxhS\u03b8 iqm \u2264 2 2,\n(7.8)\n\u03b8\n\np\n\nwhere we have used x2 + y 2 = max\u03b8 (cos \u03b8 x + sin \u03b8 y), and where S\u03b8 = cos \u03b8 Bab +\nsin \u03b8 Bac .\n\u221a\nWe will now prove this by showing that |hBab cos \u03b8 + Bac sin \u03b8iqm | \u2264 2 2 for all\n\u03b8, using a method presented by Dieks [2002] in a different context. In this proof we\nonly consider quantum correlations so for brevity we drop the subscript 'qm' from\nthe expectation values. Let us first write\nBab cos \u03b8 + Bac sin \u03b8 = (A + A\u2032 )B cos \u03b8+(A \u2212 A\u2032 )B \u2032 cos \u03b8+\n\n(A + A\u2032 )C sin \u03b8 + (A \u2212 A\u2032 )C sin \u03b8.\n\n(7.9)\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n173\n\n\u03c3z\n\n\u273b\nA\n\n\u272f\n\n\u03b8\u2732\n\u03b8 \u03c3x\n\n\u2765\n\nA\u2032\nFigure 7.2: Expressing A and A\u2032 in terms of orthogonal Pauli spin observables in some\nbasis.\n\nNext we express A and A\u2032 in terms of orthogonal Pauli observables in some basis\nusing the geometry of Figure 7.2: A = cos \u03b3\u03c3x + sin \u03b3\u03c3z and A\u2032 = cos \u03b3\u03c3x \u2212 sin \u03b3\u03c3z .\nThis gives A + A\u2032 = 2 cos \u03b3\u03c3x , A \u2212 A\u2032 = 2 sin \u03b3\u03c3z . Taking the expectation value of\n(7.9) gives\n|hBab cos \u03b8iab + hBac sin \u03b8iac | = 2|h\u03c3x Biab cos \u03b3 cos \u03b8 + h\u03c3z B \u2032 iab sin \u03b3 cos \u03b8\n\n+ h\u03c3x Ciac cos \u03b3 sin \u03b8 + h\u03c3z C \u2032 iac sin \u03b3 sin \u03b8| (7.10)\n\nThe right hand side can be considered to be twice the absolute value of the inproduct of the two four-dimensional vectors a = (h\u03c3x Biab , h\u03c3z B \u2032 iab , h\u03c3x Ciac , h\u03c3z C \u2032 iac )\nand b = (cos \u03b3 cos \u03b8, sin \u03b3 cos \u03b8,cos \u03b3 sin \u03b8,sin \u03b3 sin \u03b8). If we now apply the CauchySchwartz inequality |(a, b)| \u2264 ||a|| ||b|| we find\n|hBab cos \u03b8iab + hBac sin \u03b8iac |\nq\n\u2264 2 h\u03c3x Bi2ab + h\u03c3z B \u2032 i2ab + h\u03c3x Ci2ac + h\u03c3z C \u2032 i2ac \u00d7\nq\ncos2 \u03b3(cos2 \u03b8 + sin2 \u03b8) + sin2 \u03b3(cos2 \u03b8 + sin2 \u03b8)\np\n\u2264 2 2(h\u03c3x i2a + h\u03c3z i2a )\n\u221a q\n(7.11)\n\u2264 2 2 1 \u2212 h\u03c3y i2a\n\u221a\n\u22642 2\n(7.12)\nThis proves (7.8). Here we have used that h\u03c3x i2qm + h\u03c3y i2qm + h\u03c3z i2qm \u2264 1 for all\nsingle qubit quantum states, and for clarity we have used the subscripts ab, ac and\na to indicate with respect to which subsystems the quantum expectation values are\ntaken. Using (7.11) we obtain\nhBab i2qm + hBac i2qm \u2264 8(1 \u2212 h\u03c3y i2a ),\n\n(7.13)\n\nwhich strengthens the original monogamy inequality (7.1). An alternative strengthening of (7.1) was already found by Toner and Verstraete [2006]: hBab i2qm +hBac i2qm \u2264\n8(1 \u2212 h\u03c3y \u03c3y i2bc ).\n\n\f174\n\nChapter 7\n\nSo far we have only focused on subsystems ab and ac, and not on the subsystem\nbc. One could thus also consider the quantity hBbc iqm . The above method would give\nthe intersection of the three cylinders hBab i2qm +hBac i2qm \u2264 8, hBab i2qm +hBbc i2qm \u2264 8,\nhBac i2qm + hBbc i2qm \u2264 8. It is known [Toner and Verstraete, 2006] that this bound is\nnot tight.\nIt might be tempting to think that because of these results we could have the\nfollowing even stronger inequality than (7.1):\nhBab i2qm + hBac i2qm + hBbc i2qm \u2264 8.\n\n(7.14)\n\nHowever, this is not true. For a pure separable state (e.g. | 000i) the left hand\nside has a maximum of 12, which violates (7.14). But inequality (7.14) is true for\nthe exceptional case that we have maximal violation for one pair, say ab, since we\nknow from (7.1) that hBac iqm and hBbc iqm for the other two pairs must then be\nzero. We can see the monogamy trade-off at work: in case of maximal violation of\nthe CHSH inequality (i.e., for maximal entanglement) the left hand side of (7.14)\nhas a maximum of 8, whereas in case of no violation of the CHSH inequality it\nallows for a maximum value of 12, which can be obtained by pure separable states.\nThus we see the opposite behavior from what is happening in the ordinary CHSH\ninequality: for the expression considered here separability gives higher values, and\nentanglement necessarily lower values.\nA correct bound is obtained from (7.11) and the two similar ones for the other\ntwo expressions hBab i2qm + hBbc i2qm and hBac i2qm + hBbc i2qm . This gives:\nhBab i2qm + hBac i2qm + hBbc i2qm \u2264 12 \u2212 4(h\u03c3y i2a + h\u03c3y i2b + h\u03c3y i2c ).\n\n(7.15)\n\nHowever, it is unknown if this inequality is tight.\n\n7.1.2\n\nMonogamy of non-local quantum correlations vs.\nmonogamy of entanglement\n\nTwo types of monogamy and shareability have been discussed: of entanglement and\nof correlations. These are different in principle, although sometimes they go hand\nin hand. Monogamy (shareability) of entanglement is a property of a quantum\nstate, whereas monogamy (shareability) of correlations is not solely determined\nby the state of the system under consideration, but it is also dependent on the\nspecific setup used to determine the correlations. That is, it is crucial to also know\nthe number of observables per party and the number of outcomes per observable.\nIt is thus possible that a quantum state can give non-local correlations that are\nmonogamous when obtained in one setup, but which are shareable when obtained\nin another setup. An example of this will be given below. This example also shows\nthat shareability of non-local quantum correlations and shareability of entanglement\nare related in a non-trivial way.\nMasanes et al. [2006] already remarked (and as was discussed above) that, if we\nconsider an unlimited number of parties, locality and \u221e-shareability of bi-partite\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n175\n\ncorrelations are identical properties. This is analogous to the fact that quantum\nseparability and \u221e-shareability of a quantum state are identical in the case of an\nunlimited number of parties. But if we consider shareability with respect to only one\nother party the analogy between locality, separability and shareability breaks down.\nInstead we have the following result: Shareability of non-local quantum correlations\nimplies shareability of entanglement of mixed states, but not vice versa. The proof\nruns as follows. Because by assumption the correlations are shareable they are\nidentical for parties a and b and a and c. Furthermore, because the correlations are\nnon-local, the quantum states for ab and ac that are supposed to give rise to these\ncorrelations must be entangled. They furthermore must be non-pure, i.e., mixed,\nbecause entanglement of pure states can not be shared. This concludes the proof.\nBelow we give an example of this and show that the converse implication does not\nhold. In order to do so we will first discuss methods that reveal the shareability of\nnon-local correlations.\nIn general a bi-partite quantum state can be investigated using different setups\nthat each have a different number of observables per party and outcomes per observable. In each such a setup the monogamy of the correlations that are obtainable via\nmeasurements on the state can be investigated. This is performed via a Bell-type\ninequality that distinguishes local from non-local correlations in the setup used.\nLet us first assume the case of two parties that each measure two dichotomous\nobservables. For this case the only relevant local Bell-type inequality is the CHSH\ninequality for which we have seen that the Toner-Verstraete trade-off (7.1) implies\nthat all quantum non-local correlations must be monogamous: it is not possible to\nhave correlations between party a and b of subsystem ab and between a and c of\nsubsystem ac such that both |hBab iqm | and |hBac iqm | violate the LHV bound.\nIt is tempting to think that those entangled states that show monogamy of\nnon-local quantum correlations will also show monogamy of entanglement. This,\nhowever, is not the case. We have seen that in general entanglement of mixed\nstates can be shared to another party, and for our particular case considered here\nthree-party pure entangled states exist whose reduced bi-partite states are identical,\nentangled and able to violate the CHSH inequality (e.g., the W-state of (7.24) has\nsuch reduced bi-partite states). These reduced bi-partite states are mixed and their\nentanglement is shareable, yet they show monogamy of the non-local correlations\nobtainable from these states in a setup that has two dichotomous observables per\nparty. Thus we cannot infer from the monogamy of non-local correlations that\nquantum states responsible for such correlations have monogamy of entanglement;\nsome of them have shareable mixed state entanglement. Consequently, the study\nof the non-locality of correlations in a setup that has two dichotomous observables\nper party, and consequently the CHSH inequality, does not reveal shareability of\nthe entanglement of bi-partite mixed states.\nIt is possible to reveal shareability of entanglement of bi-partite mixed states\nusing a Bell-type inequality. But for that it is necessary that the non-local correlations which are obtained from the state in question are not monogamous, i.e., a\n\n\f176\n\nChapter 7\n\nsetup must be used in which some non-local quantum correlations turn out to be\nshareable. The case of two dichotomous observables per party was shown not to\nsuffice. However, adding one observable per party does suffice. Consider the setup\nwhere each of the two parties measures three dichotomic observables, which will\nbe denoted by A, A\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032 and B, B, B \u2032\u2032 respectively. Collins and Gisin [2004] have\nshown that for this setup only one relevant new inequality besides the CHSH inequality can be obtained (modulo permutations of observables and outcomes). This\ninequality reads:\nhCilhv := hABilhv + hA\u2032 Bilhv + hA\u2032\u2032 Bilhv + hAB \u2032 ilhv + hA\u2032 B \u2032 ilhv + hAB \u2032\u2032 ilhv\n\n\u2212 hA\u2032\u2032 B \u2032 ilhv \u2212 hA\u2032 B \u2032\u2032 ilhv + hAilhv + hA\u2032 ilhv \u2212 hBilhv \u2212 hB \u2032 ilhv \u2264 4\n(7.16)\n\nCollins and\np Gisin [2004] show that the fully entangled pure three-qubit state | \u03c6i =\n\u03bc| 000i+ (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )/2(| 110i+| 101i) gives for some values of \u03bc correlations between\nparty a and b of subsystem ab and between a and c of subsystem ac such that\nthe inequality is violated: hCab iqm \u2265 4 and hCac iqm \u2265 4. Some of the non-local\ncorrelations between party a and b can thus be shared with party a and c.\nSince | \u03c6i is a pure entangled three-qubit state the two-qubit reduced states \u03c1ab\nand \u03c1ac of subsystem ab and ac respectively are mixed. Furthermore, since the state\n| \u03c6i is symmetric with respect to qubit b and c these reduced states are identical.\nThey must also be entangled because they violate the two-party inequality (7.16).\nTherefore, the two-qubit mixed entangled state \u03c1ab is shareable to at least one\nother qubit. This shows that the inequality (7.16) is suitable to reveal shareability\nof entanglement of mixed states.\nIt would be interesting to investigate the multi-partite extension of these results.\nDoes monogamy exist for quantum correlations that violate a N -qubit Bell-type\ninequality, such as the N -partite Mermin-type inequalities? Are these inequalities\nalso suitable for revealing shareability of entanglement of mixed N -qubit states for\nsome definite number N ? In the next section, section 7.2, such an investigation\nis performed for N = 3: we study the monogamy of bi-separable three-partite\nquantum correlations that violate a three-qubit Bell-type inequality that has two\ndichotomic measurement per party. For this specific Bell-type inequality we find\nthat maximal violation by the bi-separable three-partite quantum correlations is\nmonogamous. This is to be expected because maximal quantum correlations are\nobtained from pure state entanglement which is monogamous, but we non-trivially\nfind that the correlations that give non-maximal violations can be shared.\n\n7.2\n\nMonogamy of three-qubit bi-separable\nquantum correlations\n\nRecently a set of Bell-type inequalities was presented by Sun and Fei [2006] that\ngives a finer classification for entanglement in three-partite systems than was pre-\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n177\n\nviously known. The inequalities distinguish three different types of bi-partite entanglement that may exist in three-partite systems. They not only determine if one\nof the three parties is separable with respect to the other two, but also which one.\nIt was shown that the three inequalities give a bound that can be thought of as\ntracing out a sphere in the space of expectations of the three Bell operators that\nwere used in the inequalities. Here we strengthen this bound by showing that all\nstates are confined within the interior of the intersection of three cylinders and the\nalready mentioned sphere.\nFurthermore, in chapters 4 and 6 it was shown that considerably stronger separability inequalities for the expectation of Bell operators can be obtained if one\nrestricts oneself to local orthogonal spin observables (so-called LOO's [G\u00fchne et al.,\n2006; Yu and Liu, 2005]). We will show that the same is the case for the Bell operators considered here by strengthening all above mentioned three-partite inequalities\nunder the restriction of orthogonal observables.\nThe relevant three-partite inequalities are included in the N -partite inequalities\nderived by Chen et al. [2006]. It was shown that these N -partite inequalities can be\nviolated maximally by the N -partite maximally entangled GHZ states [Chen et al.,\n2006], but, as will be shown here, they can also be maximally violated by states that\ncontain only (N \u2212 1)-partite entanglement. Although these inequalities thus give a\nfurther classification of multi-partite entanglement (besides some other interesting\nproperties), they can not be used to distinguish full N -partite entanglement from\n(N \u2212 1)-partite entanglement in N -partite states. It is shown that this is neither\nthe case for the stronger bounds that are derived for the case of LOO's.\nIn subsection 7.2.1 the case of unrestricted spin observables is analyzed and\nsubsection 7.2.2 is devoted to the restriction to LOO's. Lastly, in the discussion of\nsubsection 7.2.3 we will interpret the presented quadratic inequalities as indicating\na type of monogamy of maximal bi-separable three-party quantum correlations.\nNon-maximal correlations can however be shared. This is contrasted to the TonerVerstraete monogamy inequalities (7.1).\n\n7.2.1\n\nAnalysis for unrestricted observables\n\nChen et al. [2006] consider N -parties that each have two alternative dichotomic\nmeasurements denoted by Aj and A\u2032j (outcomes \u00b11) and show that local hiddenvariable models (LHV) require that\n(i)\n\n|hDN ilhv | :=\n\n1\n(i)\n|hBN \u22121 (Ai + A\u2032i ) + (Ai \u2212 A\u2032i )ilhv | \u2264 1,\n2\n\n(i)\n\n(7.17)\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , N , where BN \u22121 is the Bell polynomial of the Werner-Wolf-\u017bukowskiBrukner (WWZB) inequalities [Werner and Wolf, 2001; \u017bukowski and Brukner,\n2002] for the N \u2212 1 parties, except for party i. These Bell-type inequalities have\nonly two different local settings and are contained in the general inequalities for\nN > 2 parties that have more than two alternative measurement settings derived\n\n\f178\n\nChapter 7\n\nby Laskowski et al. [2004]. Indeed, they follow from the latter when choosing certain\nsettings equal. Note furthermore that the WWZB inequalities are contained in the\ninequalities of (7.17) by choosing AN = A\u2032N .\nThe quantum mechanical counterpart of the Bell-type inequality of (7.17) is\nobtained by introducing operators Ak , A\u2032k for each party k that represent the dichotomic observables in question. Let us define analogously Sun and Fei [2006] the\noperator\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nDN := BN \u22121 \u2297 (Ai + A\u2032i )/2 + 1N \u22121 \u2297 (Ai \u2212 A\u2032i )/2,\n(i)\n\n(7.18)\n\n(i)\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , N . Here BN \u22121 and 1N \u22121 are respectively the Bell operator of\nthe WWZB inequalities and the identity operator both for the N \u2212 1 qubits not\ninvolving qubit i.\nQuantum mechanical counterparts of the local realism inequalities of (7.17) are\n(i)\n(i)\nobtained by deducing relevant bounds on the expression hDN iqm := Tr[DN \u03c1],\nwhere \u03c1 is a N -party quantum state. For example, separable states must obey\n(i)\n\n|hDN iqm | \u2264 1.\n\n(7.19)\n\nIn the remainder we only consider quantum correlations so we drop the subscript\n'qm' from the expectation value expressions.\nSince the Bell inequality of (7.19) uses only two alternative dichotomic observables for each party the maximum violation of this Bell inequality is obtained for\nan N -party pure qubit state and furthermore for projective observables [Masanes,\n2006, 2005; Toner and Verstraete, 2006]. In the following we will thus consider qubits\nonly and the observables will be represented by the spin operators Ak = ak * \u03c3 and\nA\u2032k = a\u2032k * \u03c3 with ak and a\u2032k unit vectors that denote the measurement settings and\nP\na * \u03c3 = l al \u03c3l where \u03c3l are the familiar Pauli spin observables for l = x, y, z on\nH = C2 . In fact, it suffices [Toner and Verstraete, 2006] to consider only real and\ntraceless observables, so we can set ay = 0 for all observables.\nAn interesting feature of the inequalities in (7.19) is that all generalized GHZ\nstates | \u03c8\u03b1N i = cos \u03b1| 0i\u2297N + sin \u03b1| 1i\u2297N can be made to violate them for all \u03b1,\nwhich is not the case for the WWZB inequalities [Chen et al., 2006; Laskowski et\nal., 2004]. Furthermore, the maximum is given by\n(i)\n\nmax |hDN i| = 2(N \u22122)/2 ,\n\nAi ,A\u2032i\n\n(7.20)\n\nas was proven by Chen et al. [2006]. They also noted that this maximum is attained\nfor the maximally entangled N -party GHZ state | GHZN i (i.e., \u03b1 = \u03c0/4) and for\nall local unitary transformations of this state. However, not noted by Chen et al.\n[2006] is the fact that the maximum is also obtainable by N -partite states that only\nhave (N \u2212 1)-partite entanglement, which is the content of the following theorem.\n(i)\nTheorem 1. Not only can the maximum value of 2(N \u22122)/2 for hDN i be reached\nby fully N -partite entangled states (proven by Chen et al. [2006]) but also by N partite states that only have (N \u2212 1)-partite entanglement.\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n179\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nProof : Firstly, (BN \u22121 )2 \u2264 2(N \u22122) 1N \u22121 (as proven in [Werner and Wolf, 2001]).\nHere X \u2264 Y means that Y \u2212X is semi-positive definite. Thus the maximum possible\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\neigenvalue of BN \u22121 is 2(N \u22122)/2 . Consider a state |\u03a8N \u22121 i for which hBN \u22121 i| \u03a8(i) i =\nN \u22121\n\n2(N \u22122)/2 . This must be [Werner and Wolf, 2001] a maximally entangled (N \u2212 1)partite state (for the N parties except for party i), such as the state | GHZN \u22121 i.\n(i)\nNext consider the state | \u03be (i) i = | \u03a8N \u22121 i \u2297 | 0i i, with | 0i i an eigenstate of the\nobservable Ai with eigenvalue 1. This is an N -partite state that only has (N \u2212 1)partite entanglement. Furthermore choose Ai = A\u2032i in (7.18). We then obtain\n(i)\n(i)\nhDN i| \u03be(i) i = hBN \u22121 i| \u03a8(i) i hAi i| 0i i = 2(N \u22122)/2 , which was to be proved. \u0003\nN \u22121\n\nThis theorem thus shows that the Bell inequalities of (7.19) can not distinguish\nbetween full N -partite entanglement and (N \u2212 1)-partite entanglement, and thus\ncan not serve as full N -partite entanglement witnesses.\nLet us now concentrate on the three-partite case (N = 3 and i = 1, 2, 3). Sun and\n(i)\nFei [2006] obtain that fully separable three-partite states satisfy |hD3 i| \u2264 1, which\n\u221a\n(i)\ndoes not violate the local realistic bound of (7.17). General states give |hD3 i| \u2264 2,\nwhich follows from (7.20). As follows from Theorem 1 this can be saturated by both\nfully entangled states as well as for bi-separable entangled states (e.g., two-partite\nentangled three-partite states).\nSun and Fei [2006] have furthermore presented a set of Bell-type inequalities\nthat distinguish three possible forms of bi-separable entanglement. They consider\nbi-separable states that are separable with respect to partitions 1 \u2212 23, 2 \u2212 13\nand 3 \u2212 12 respectively, where the set of states in these partitions is denoted as\nS1\u221223 , S2\u221213 , S3\u221212 and which we label by j = 1, 2, 3 respectively. These sets contain\nstates such as \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c123 , \u03c12 \u2297 \u03c113 , and \u03c13 \u2297 \u03c112 respectively. We call the correlations\nobtained from a state that is bi-separable with respect to one of the three partitions\n'bi-separable three-partite correlations'.\nFor states in partition j (and for i = 1, 2, 3) Sun and Fei [2006] obtained\n(i)\n\n|hD3 i| \u2264 \u03c7i,j ,\n\n(7.21)\n\n\u221a\nwith \u03c7i,j = 2 for i = j and \u03c7i,j = 1 otherwise.\nThey furthermore proved that for all three qubit states\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nhD3 i2 + hD3 i2 + hD3 i2 \u2264 3,\n\n\u2200\u03c1.\n\n(7.22)\n\nAlthough this inequality is stronger than the set above (for details see Figure 1 in\n[Sun and Fei, 2006]), it can be saturated by fully separable states. For example,\nchoose the state | 000i and all observables to be projections onto this state. Then\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nwe get hD3 i2| 000i + hD3 i2| 000i + hD3 i2| 000i = 3.\n(i)\n\nLet us consider D3 (for i = 1, 2, 3) to be three coordinates of a space in the\nsame spirit as Sun and Fei [2006] did. They showed that the fully separable states\nare confined to a cube with edge length 2 and the bi-separable\nstates in\n\u221a\n\u221a partition\nj = 1, 2, 3\u221aare confined to cuboids with size either 2 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, 2 \u00d7 2 2 \u00d7 2, or\n2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 2. Note that states exist that are bi-separable with respect to all three\n\n\f180\n\nChapter 7\n\npartitions (and thus must lie within the cube with edge length 2), but which are\nnot fully separable [Bennett et al., 1999b].\nare\n\u221a\n\u221a Furthermore, all three-qubit states\nin the intersection of the cube with size 2 2 and of the sphere with radius 3. Sun\nand Fei [2006] note that this sphere is just the external sphere of the cube with\nedge 2, which is consistent with the above observation that fully separable states\n(i)\n(i+1)\ncan lie on this sphere. If we look at the D3 \u2212 D3\nplane we get Figure 7.3. The\nfully separable states are in region I; region II belongs to the bi-separable states\nof partition j = i + 1; and region III belongs to states of partition j = i. Other\nbi-separable states and\u221afully entangled states are outside these regions but within\nthe circle with radius 3. However, in the following theorem we show a quadratic\ninequality even stronger than (7.22)\n\u221a which thus strengthens the bound in Figure\n7.3 given by the circle of radius 3 and which forces the bi-separable states just\nmentioned into the black regions.\n(i+1)\n\nhD3\n\ni\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nI\n\nIII\n\n(i)\n\nhD3 i\n\nII\n\n(i)\n\n(i+1)\n\nFigure 7.3: D3 \u2212 D3\nplane with the stronger bound given by the circle with radius\np\n\u221a\n5/2 which strengthens the less strong bound with radius 3 that is given by the dashed\ncircle.\n\nTheorem 2. For the case where each observer chooses between two settings all\nthree-qubit states obey the following inequality:\n(i)\n\n(i+1) 2\n\nhD3 i2 + hD3\n\ni \u2264\n\n5\n,\n2\n\n\u2200\u03c1,\n\nfor i = 1, 2, 3 and where i and i + 1 are both modulo 3.\n\n(7.23)\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n181\n\nProof : The proof uses the exact same steps as the proof of (7.22) by Sun and\nFei [2006, proof of Theorem 2] and can be easily performed, although the left hand\nside of (7.23) contains only two terms instead of the three terms in the left hand\nside of (7.22). This results in only a minor change in calculations6 . Case (3) in this\nproof then has the highest bound of 5/2, whereas the other three cases give a lower\nbound equal to 2. \u0003\nNote that in contrast to (7.22) the inequality of (7.23) can not be saturated by\nseparable states, since the latter have a maximum of 2 for the left hand expression\nin (7.23).\n(i)\nIf we again look at the space given by the coordinates D3 (for i = 1, 2, 3), we\nhave thus found that all states are, firstly, confined within the intersection of the\n(i)\n(i+1) 2\nthree orthogonal cylinders\nhD3 i2 +hD3\ni \u2264 5/2 (with i+1 and i+2 both modulo\np\nand,\nsecondly,\nthey\nmust furthermore still lie within the\n3) each with radius 5/2\n\u221a\ncube of\u221aedge length 2 2, and thirdly they must also lie within the sphere with\nradius 3. In Figure 7.3 we see the strengthened bound of (7.23) as compared to\nthe bound of Sun and Fei [2006]. However, we see from this figure that neither the\nintersection of the three cylinders, nor the sphere, nor the cube give tight bounds.\nThe black areas in Figure 7.3 are non-empty. For the case of (7.23) states thus\n(i)\n(i+1)\nexist that have both |hD3 i| > 1 and |hD3\ni| > 1 (for some i). For example, the\nso-called W -state\n\u221a\n| W i = (| 001i + | 010i + | 100i)/ 3,\n(7.24)\n(i)\n\ngives |hD3 i| = 1.022 for all i when the observables are chosen as follows: Ai =\ncos \u03b1i \u03c3z + sin \u03b1i \u03c3x with \u03b1i = \u22120.133 and A\u2032i = cos \u03b2i \u03c3z + sin \u03b2i \u03c3x with \u03b2i = 0.460.\n\n7.2.2\n\nRestriction to local orthogonal spin observables\n\nRoy [2005] and Uffink and Seevinck [2008] have shown that considerably stronger\nseparability inequalities for the expectation of the bi-partite Bell operator B2 can\nbe obtained if one restricts oneself to local orthogonal observables (LOO's). See\n(i)\nchapter 4. We will now show that the same is the case for the Bell operator D3 .\nThe following theorem strengthens all previous bounds of section II for general\nobservables.\nTheorem 3. Suppose all local observables are orthogonal, i.e., ai * a\u2032i = 0, then\nthe following inequalities hold:\np\n(i)\n(i) For all states: |hD3 i| \u2264 3/2.\n\n6 In further detail, steps (1) to (4) of the proof by Sun and Fei [2006] become (using the\nterminology of their proof): (1): \u03c9 = 2(s1 \u2297 s2 \u2297 s3 * Q)2 = 2h \u03a8|C1 C2 C3 | \u03a8i2 \u2264 2, (2): \u03c9 =\n2(s1 \u2297 s2 \u2297 s3 * Q + s1 \u2297 s2 \u2297 t3 * Q)2 = 2h \u03a8|C1 C2 (C3 + D3 )| \u03a8i2 \u2264 2, (3): \u03c9 = (5/4)(cos(\u03b81 +\n\u03b82 + \u03b83 ) \u2212 sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 + \u03b83 ))2 \u2264 5/2, (4): \u03c9 = (cos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 + \u03b83 ) \u2212 sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 + \u03b83 ))2 \u2264 2. Here\n(i)\n(i+1) 2\n\u03c9 = hD3 i2 + hD3\ni (i.e., the l.h.s. of (7.23)), where we have chosen i = 1. Note that by\nsymmetry the proof goes analogous for i = 2, 3. It follows that step (3) has the highest bound of\n5/2.\n\n\f182\n\nChapter 7\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) For fully separable states: |hD3 i| \u2264\n\np\n3/4.\n\n(iii) For bi-separable states in partition j = 1, 2, 3:\n(i)\n\nwith \u03c7i,j =\n\n|hD3 i| \u2264 \u03c7i,j ,\n\n(7.25)\n\n(i+1) 2\n\n(7.26)\n\np\np\n3/2 for i = j and \u03c7i,j = 3/4 otherwise.\n\n(iv) Lastly, for all states:\n\n(i)\n\nhD3 i2 + hD3\n\ni \u2264 2.\n\n(i)\n\nProof : (i) The square of D3 is given by\n1\n1\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\n(D3 )2 = (B2 )2 \u2297 (1 + ai * a\u2032i )1i + 12 \u2297 (1 \u2212 ai * a\u2032i )1i ,\n2\n2\n\n(7.27)\n\n(i)\n\nwhere 12 is the identity operator for the 2 qubits not including qubit i.

Choose now without\nlosing generality [Toner\n\u221a\nand Verstraete, 2006] s = 2(cos \u03b8, 0, sin \u03b8) and t = 2(\u2212 sin \u03b8, 0, cos \u03b8).

Compared to the\ncase where no restriction was made to orthogonal observables (cf. Figure 7.3) we\nsee that we can still distinguish the different kinds of bi-separable states, but they\ncan still not be distinguished from fully three-partite entangled states since both\n(i)\ntypes of states still have the same maximum for hD3 i. Furthermore, the ratio of\n(i)\nthe different maxima of\u221ahD3 i for\nand\np fully separable\np\n\u221a bi-separable states is still the\nsame, i.e., the ratio is 2/1 = ( 3/2)/( 3/4) = 2.\nThe black areas\n7.4 are again\np non-empty since states exist that have\np in Figure (i+1)\n(i)\ni| > 3/4 for the case of orthogonal observables.\nboth |hD3 i| > 3/4 and |hD3\n(i)\nFor example, the W -state of (7.24) gives |hD3 i| = 0.906 for all i, for the local angles\n\u03b1i = 0.54 = \u03b2i \u2212 \u03c0/2 in the x-z plane.\n\u221a\n\n7.2.3\n\nDiscussion of the monogamy aspects\n(i)\n\n(i+1)\n\nLet us take another look at the quadratic inequalities hD3 i2 + hD3\ni2 \u2264 5/2\n(i+1) 2\n(i) 2\nof (7.23) for general observables and hD3 i + hD3\ni \u2264 2 of (7.26) for orthogonal observables. These can be interpreted as monogamy inequalities for maximal\nbi-separable three-qubit quantum correlations (i.e., bi-separable correlations that\nsaturate the inequalities), since the inequalities show that a state that has maximal bi-separable correlations for a certain partition can not\u221ahave it maximally for\n(i)\nanother partition. Indeed, when partition i gives |hD3 i| = 2 it must be the case\n\n\fMonogamy of correlations\n\n185\n\np\n(i+1)\naccording to (7.23) that for the other two partitions both |hD3\ni| \u2264 1/2 and\np\n(i+2)\n|hD3\ni| \u2264 1/2 must hold. The latter two must thus be non-maximal as soon as\nthe first type of bi-separable correlation is maximal. And for the second\np inequality\n(i)\nof (7.26) using orthogonal observables we get that when |hD3 i| = 3/2 (this is\np\np\n(i+1)\n(i+2)\nmaximal) it must be the case that both |hD3\ni| \u2264 1/2 and |hD3\ni| \u2264 1/2,\nwhich is non-maximal.\nFrom this we see that the first (i.e., (7.23) for general observables) is a stronger\nmonogamy relationship than the second (i.e., (7.26) for orthogonal observables) in\n(i)\nthe sense that the trade-off between how much the maximal value for |hD3 i| for one\n(i+1)\n(i+2)\npartition i restricts the value of |hD3\ni|, |hD3\ni| for the other two partitions\nbelow the maximal value is larger in the first case than in the second case.\nLet us see how this compares to the Toner-Verstraete monogamy inequality\n(i)\n(i+1) 2\n(i)\ni \u2264 2 of (7.1). Here |hB2 ilhv | \u2264 1 is the ordinary CHSH inequality\nhB2 i2 + hB2\n(scaled down by a factor of 2) for the local correlations of the two qubits other than\nqubit i (cf. (7.1)). The Toner-Verstraete monogamy inequality is even stronger\n(i)\nthan the ones presented here, because when |hB2 i| obtains its maximal value of\n\u221a\n(i+1)\n(i+2)\n2 it must be that |hB2\ni|=|hB2\ni| = 0.\nFurthermore, in section 7.1.2 we have seen that the Toner-Verstraete monogamy\nrelationship shows that the non-locality indicated by correlations that violate the\n(i)\nCHSH inequality cannot be shared: as soon as for some i one has |hB2 i| > 1, it\n(i+1)\n(i+2)\nmust be that both |hB2\ni| < 1 and |hB2\ni| < 1. But we have also seen that\nCollins and Gisin [2004] have nevertheless shown that the quantum non-locality\nindicated by a violation of the bi-partite Bell-type inequality (7.16) indicates can\n(i)\nbe shared. Since |hD3 ilhv | \u2264 1 are local Bell-type inequalities (see (7.17)) whose\nviolation can be seen to indicate some non-locality, the inequalities considered here\ncould possibly also indicate some quantum non-locality sharing. Indeed, this is the\ncase since it was shown that the black areas in Figure 7.3 are non-empty. Violation\nof the Bell-type inequalities given here thus indicate shareability of the non-locality\nof bi-separable three-qubit quantum correlations.\nIn conclusion, we have presented stronger bounds for bi-separable correlations\nin three-partite systems than were given by Sun and Fei [2006] and extended this\nanalysis to the case of the restriction to orthogonal observables which gave even\nstronger bounds. The quadratic inequalities for bi-separable correlations give a\nmonogamy relationship for correlations that violate these inequalities maximally\n(i.e., such correlations cannot be shared), but they indicate shareability of the nonmaximally violating correlations.\nWe hope that future research will reveal more of the monogamy of multi-partite\nquantum correlations. It could therefore be fruitful to generalize this work from\nthree to a larger number of parties. Even more interesting would be including also\nno-signaling correlations besides correlations that come from quantum states.\n\n\f186\n\n7.3\n\nChapter 7\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this chapter we have seen that, apart from using Bell-type inequalities in terms\nof all parties involved, another fruitful way of studying the different kinds of correlations is via the question whether the correlations can be shared. Here one focuses\non subsets of the parties and whether their correlations can be extended to parties\nnot in the original subsets. This can be done either directly in terms of joint probability distributions or in terms of relations between Bell-type inequalities that hold\nfor different, but overlapping subsets of the parties involved.\nWe have proven that unrestricted general correlations can be shared to any\nnumber of parties (called \u221e-shareable). In the case of no-signaling correlations it\nwas already known that such correlations can be \u221e-shareable iff the correlations are\nlocal. We have shown that this implies, firstly, that partially-local correlations are\nalso \u221e-shareable, since they are combinations of local and unrestricted correlations\nbetween subsets of the parties. Secondly, it implies that both quantum and nosignaling correlations that are non-local are not \u221e-shareable and we have shown\nmonogamy constraints for such correlations.\nWe have investigated the relationship between sharing non-local quantum correlations and sharing mixed entangled states, and already for the simplest bi-partite\ncorrelations this was shown to be non-trivial. The Collins-Gisin Bell-type inequality\nindicates that non-local quantum correlations can be shared and it thus indicates\nsharing of entanglement of mixed states. The CHSH inequality was shown not to\nindicate this. This shows that non-local bi-partite correlations in a setup with twodichotomous observables per party cannot be shared, whereas this is possible in a\nsetup with one observable per party more.\nWe have given a simpler proof of the monogamy relation hBab i2qm + hBac i2qm \u2264 8\nof Toner and Verstraete [2006]. We have furthermore provided a different strengthening of this constraint than the one given by Toner and Verstraete. For no-signaling\ncorrelations we have argued that the monogamy constraint |hBab ins | + |hBac ins | \u2264 4\nof Toner [2006] can be interpreted as a non-trivial bound on the set of three-partite\nno-signaling correlations. This discerning inequality uses product expectation values only. We know of no other such non-trivial bounds for no-signaling correlations\nof three or more parties (in the next chapter this will be further discussed).\nLastly, we have derived monogamy constraints for three-qubit bi-separable quantum correlations, which is a first example of investigating monogamy of quantum\ncorrelations using a three-partite Bell-type inequality.\n\n\fChapter 8\n\n187\n\nDiscerning multi-partite partiallylocal, quantum mechanical and\nno-signaling correlations\nThis chapter is in part based on Seevinck and Svetlichny [2002].\n\n8.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the previous chapters we have seen that quadratic and linear Bell-type inequalities\ndistinguish the correlations of various types of multi-partite quantum states. We\nhave also we seen that Mermin-type inequalities discern LHV models from quantum\nmechanics, i.e., they discern local correlations from quantum correlations. In this\nchapter we will construct new Bell-type inequalities to discern partially-local from\nquantum mechanical correlations and also discuss the issue of discerning multipartite no-signaling correlations. Unfortunately, the Mermin-type inequalities do\nnot suffice for either purpose.\nLet us recall the notion of partial locality by reviewing some of the definitions\nthat were given in chapter 2. For N = 2 locality and partial locality coincide so\nwe start our investigation at N = 3. Here we consider three-partite models where\narbitrary correlations (e.g., a signaling correlation) are allowed between two of the\nthree parties but only local correlations between these two and the third party. The\ntwo parties that are non-locally correlated need not be fixed in advance, but can\nbe chosen with probability pi . The correlations (joint probability distributions) are\n\n\f188\n\nChapter 8\n\nthus of the form\nP (a1 , a2 , a3 |A1 , A2 , A3 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nd\u03bb [ p1 \u03c11 (\u03bb)P1 (a1 |A1 , \u03bb)P1 (a2 , a3 |A2 , A3 , \u03bb)\n+ p2 \u03c12 (\u03bb)P2 (a2 |A2 , \u03bb)P2 (a1 , a3 |A1 , A3 , \u03bb)\n\n+ p3 \u03c13 (\u03bb)P3 (a3 |A3 , \u03bb)P3 (a1 , a2 |A1 , A2 , \u03bb) ].\n(8.1)\n\nwith Ai observables and ai outcomes and where P1 (a2 , a3 |A2 , A3 , \u03bb) can be any\nprobability distribution; it need not factorise into P1 (a2 |A2 , \u03bb)P1 (a3 |A3 , \u03bb). Analogously for the other two joint probability terms. The \u03c1i (\u03bb) are the hiddenvariable distributions. Models that allow for correlations of the form (8.1) are called\npartially-local hidden-variable models (PLHV) models. Models whose correlations\ncannot be written in this form are fully non-local, i.e., they are said to contain full\nnon-locality.\nFor the three-partite case Svetlichny [1987] derived a non-trivial Bell-type inequality for partially-local correlations of the form (8.1). This inequality can thus\ndistinguish between full three-partite non-locality and two-partite non-locality in a\nthree-partite system. A priori it is not clear if the correlations of the form (8.1)\nare stronger than quantum mechanical correlations. However, Svetlichny showed\nthat quantum states exist that give correlations that violate the inequality, thereby\nproving that these correlations are fully non-local. Furthermore, no-signaling correlations were shown to violate the inequality maximally [Jones et al., 2005; Barrett et\nal., 2005]. Thus three-partite quantum and no-signaling correlations exist that cannot be reproduced by any three-partite PLHV model, despite the fact that PLHV\nmodels allow for arbitrary strong signaling correlations between any two of the three\nparties.\nIn this chapter we generalize Svetlichny's inequalities to the multi-partite case\nand we call them Svetlichny inequalities. Quantum mechanics violates these inequalities for some fully entangled multi-qubit states and these thus contain fully\nnon-local correlations. In a recent four particle experiment such a violation was observed, so full non-locality occurs in nature. It is an open question whether all fully\nentangled states imply full non-locality. If they do, this cannot always be shown by\nviolations of the Svetlichny inequalities, because we will show that fully entangled\nstates exist that do not violate any of them.\nAfter we announced the multi-partite generalization of Svetlichny's three-partite\ninequality, as published in [Seevinck and Svetlichny, 2002], Collins et al. [2002]\nindependently also presented such a generalization. Cereceda [2002] commented\nupon the original three-partite case, and Jones et al. [2005] performed an extension\nof the generalization and furthermore showed that no-signaling correlations can give\nmaximal violation of the Svetlichny inequalities.\nThe outline of this chapter is as follows. In section 8.2 some preliminary results\nand notations are presented. In section 8.3 the three-partite case is treated as a\nstepping stone to the multi-partite generalization of section 8.4. In presenting the\n\n\fDiscerning multi-partite correlations\n\n189\n\nthree-partite case we use the presentation as in Collins et al. [2002] and Cereceda\n[2002]. For the multi-partite generalization we use the original proof given by us,\nand present some further multi-partite results by Jones et al. [2005]. In section 8.5\nwe look at some further aspects of quantum mechanical violations of the generalized\nSvetlichny inequalities. In section 8.6 we comment on the fact that although the\nSvetlichny inequalities discern partially-local and quantum correlations from the\nmost general correlations, they cannot do so for no-signaling correlations. What set\nof inequalities that bound some linear sum of product expectation values (possibly\nincluding some marginal expectation values) and that would discern the multipartite no-signaling correlations, we pose as an interesting open problem. Lastly,\nin section 8.7 we give a conclusion and discussion of the results obtained.\n\n8.2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn order to introduce the Svetlichny inequality and to give its multi-partite generalization in the next section it is helpful to introduce the so-called Mermin polynomials, whose quantum counterpart we have already encountered in chapter 6 and\nthat were used to give the Mermin-type separability inequalities (6.8). Let Aj and\nA\u2032j be dichotomic observables for parties j = 1, . . . N . The Mermin polynomials\nare defined in the following way: Let M2 = A1 A2 + A\u20321 A2 + A1 A\u20322 \u2212 A\u20321 A\u20322 (i.e.,\nanalogous to the Bell operator B), and define recursively\nMj :=\n\n1\n\u2032\n(Mj\u22121 (Aj + A\u2032j ) + Mj\u22121\n(Aj \u2212 A\u2032j )),\n2\n\n(8.2)\n\nwhere for Mj\u2032 all primed and non-primed observables are exchanged. For N = 3 we\nget\nM3 :=A\u20321 A2 A3 + A1 A\u20322 A3 + A1 A2 A\u20323 \u2212 A\u20321 A\u20322 A\u20323 ,\nM3\u2032\n\n:=A1 A\u20322 A\u20323\n\n+\n\nA\u20321 A2 A\u20323\n\n+\n\nA\u20321 A\u20322 A3\n\n\u2212 A1 A2 A3 .\n\n(8.3)\n(8.4)\n\nIn the following we consider expectation values of these polynomials as predicted\nby the different types of correlations as distinguished in chapter 2. That is, we\nconsider the expectation values hMN iplhv , hMN iqm and hMN ins . Furthermore, the\nabsolute maximum on hMN i is denoted by |MN |max and is equal to the number\nof terms in the Mermin polynomial. It is always possible to find a fully non-local\nmodel that is able to give this absolute maximum.\nGisin and Bechmann-Pasquinucci [1998] were the first to derive that |hMN ilhv | \u2264\n2, |hMN iqm | \u2264 2(N +1)/2 , |MN |max = 2(N +1)/2 for N = odd, and |MN |max = 2N/2\nfor N = even. It was shown in chapter 6 that the tight quantum bounds on Mermin\npolynomials distinguish various forms of entanglement including full entanglement.\nAn interesting question now is if these polynomials are also suitable for detecting\nfull multi-partite non-locality. For this purpose one needs to find the bounds on\nhMN iplhv so as to answer if one can use some Mermin-type inequality to distinguish\n\n\f190\n\nChapter 8\n\na partially-local from a fully non-local model. It will be shown that for N = even\nthat this is indeed the case, but not for N = odd. Consequently, for N = odd new\ninequalities need to be found. Svetlichny provided the case N = 3, which we will\nreview in the next section. Later we will generalize his inequality to all N .\n\n8.3\n\nThree-partite partial locality\n\nConsider the Mermin polynomial M3 . For this case max |hM3 iqm | = |M3 |max = 4.\nWe want to determine max |hM3 iplhv |. Collins et al. [2002] obtained this as follows.\nConsider the recursive relation (8.2) so as to obtain M3 = (M2 (A3 + A\u20323 ) + M2\u2032 (A3 \u2212\nA\u20323 ))/2. Now assume partial factorisability in the sense that party 3 factorises\nfrom party 1 and 2. We note that this is not a limiting restriction because the\nsame results follows for the two other choices or convex combinations of these three\npossibilities. The desired maximum becomes: max |hM3 iplhv | = max | |M2 |max hA3 +\nA\u20323 i + |M2 |max hA3 \u2212 A\u20323 i|/2. Here the absolute maxima for the expectation values\nof M2 and M2\u2032 can be attained since arbitrary strong correlations between party 1\nand 2 are allowed. Since we are dealing with dichotomic observables with outcomes\n\u00b11, the maximum of |hM3 iplhv | is obtained if |hA3 i| = |hA\u20323 i| = 1. Without loss\nof generality we choose hA3 i = hA\u20323 i = 1 so that max |hM3 iplhv | = |M2 |max =\n|M3 |max = 4. In conclusion, we have obtained the tight bound\n|hM3 iplhv |, |hM3 iqm | \u2264 |M3 |max = 4,\n\n(8.5)\n\nfrom which it follows that M3 does not distinguish between PLHV models, quantum mechanics and models that allow for full unrestricted non-locality between all\nparties.\nThe problem lies in the fact that M3 only has four correlation terms. Cereceda\n[2002] showed that a PLHV model with correlations as in (8.1) can reproduce whatever values are assumed for the four expectation values in M3 . Likewise another\nsuch PLHV model can be found that reproduces the expectation values in M3\u2032 .\nThus, in order to give a non-trivial bound for PLHV models one needs to consider\nat least more than four product expectation values. Svetlichny considered all eight\npossible terms using the following two polynomials:\nS3\u00b1 := M3 \u00b1 M3\u2032 .\n\n(8.6)\n\nWe call these Svetlichny polynomials. Both polynomials have eight terms from\nwhich one obtains |S3\u00b1 |max = 8. Using the recursive relation (8.2) we see that S3\u00b1 is\nequal to M2 A\u20323 \u00b1 M2\u2032 A3 . Then for the case of partial factorisability where party 3\nfactorises from party 1 and 2 one obtains that the maximum of |hS3\u00b1 iplhv | is given\nby |M2 \u00b1 M2\u2032 |max = 2|A1 A\u20322 \u00b1 A\u20321 A2 |max = 4, which is half the absolute maximum\n|S3\u00b1 |max = 8. This finally gives a non-trivial inequality: all PLHV models that allow\ncorrelations of the form (8.1) must obey the following non-trivial bound\n|hS3\u00b1 iplhv | \u2264 4.\n\n(8.7)\n\n\fDiscerning multi-partite correlations\n\n191\n\nExplicitly the inequalities read:\n|hS3\u00b1 i| =|hA1 A2 A3 i \u00b1 hA1 A2 A\u20323 i \u00b1 hA1 A\u20322 A3 i \u00b1 hA\u20321 A2 A3 i\n\n\u2212 hA1 A\u20322 A\u20323 i \u2212 hA\u20321 A2 A\u20323 i \u2212 hA\u20321 A\u20322 A3 i \u00b1 hA\u20321 A\u20322 A\u20323 i| \u2264 4,\n\n(8.8)\n\nThese are necessary conditions to be obeyed by all three-partite PLHV models.\nSince hS3+ i2 +hS3\u2212 i2 = 2(hM3 i2 +hM3\u2032 i2 ) we obtain from the Mermin-type separability inequalities \u221a\n(6.8) that the maximum value attainable by quantum mechanics is\nmax |hS3\u00b1 iqm | = 4 2. This is attained for a GHZ state, as first shown by Svetlichny\n[1987]. Quantum mechanics thus contains states that have full non-locality.\nIn conclusion, Svetlichny obtained the following bounds:\n\u221a\n2 max |hS3\u00b1 iplhv | = 2 max |hS3\u00b1 iqm | = |S3\u00b1 |max = 8.\n(8.9)\n\u221a\nThe three bounds are each time increased with a factor 2. In the next section we give the multi-partite generalization of these bounds. It is noteworthy\nthat no-signaling correlations can reach the absolute maximum [Jones et al., 2005]:\nmax |hS3\u00b1 ins | = |S3\u00b1 |max . This means that the Svetlichny polynomials cannot be\nused to distinguish three-partite no-signaling correlations from more general correlations that are signaling. This will be further commented upon in section 8.6.\nTo end this section we mention that it is an open question what is the minimum\nnumber of correlation terms one should consider in a Svetlichny-like polynomial\nin order to distinguish between bi-partite non-locality and full three-partite nonlocality. We have seen that four terms does not suffice, whereas eight terms does\nsuffice, but perhaps one can do with less.\n\n8.4\n\nGeneralization to N -partite partial locality\n\nFor four parties the strategy of the previous section gives\n\u221a\nmax |hM4 iplhv | = 4, max |hM4 iqm | = 4 2, whereas |M4 |max = 8,\n\n(8.10)\n\nand analogously for M4\u2032 . This shows that for four parties the Mermin polynomial\ngives non-trivial bounds on PLHV models. Let us now generalize this by showing\n\u2032\nthat (up to a numerical factor) the Mermin polynomials MN and MN\nfor N = even\ngive valid Svetlichny inequalities that test partial factorisability. However, just as\nwas the case for N = 3 it will be shown that for N = odd one should take a linear\n\u2032\ncombination of the two Mermin polynomials MN and MN\n.\nConsider an N -partite system and let us now make the following partial factorisability assumption (we recall this from chapter 2): An ensemble of such systems\nconsists of subensembles in which each one of the subsets of the N parties form\nextended systems, whose subsystems can be correlated in any way (e.g., entangled, fully non-local) which however are uncorrelated to each other. Let us for the\ntime being focus our attention on one of these subensembles, formed by a system\n\n\f192\n\nChapter 8\n\nconsisting of two subsystems of k < N and N \u2212 k < N parties which are uncorrelated to each other. Assume also for the time being that the first subsystem is\nformed by parties 1, 2, . . . , k and the other by the remaining. We express our partial\nfactorisability hypothesis by assuming a factorisable expression for the probability\np(a1 , a2 , . . . , aN |A1 , A2 , * * * , AN ) for observing the results ai , for the observables Ai :\np(a1 , a2 , . . . , aN |A1 , A2 , . . . , AN ) =\nZ\nP (a1 , . . . , ak |A1 , . . . , Ak , \u03bb)P (ak+1 , . . . , aN |Ak+1 , . . . , AN , \u03bb) \u03c1(\u03bb) d\u03bb, (8.11)\nwhere the probabilities are conditioned to the hidden variable \u03bb with probability\nmeasure d\u03c1. Formulas similar to (8.11) with different choices of the composing\nparties and different value of k describe the other subensembles. We need not\nconsider decomposition into more than two subsystems as then any two can be\nconsidered jointly as parts of one subsystem still uncorrelated with respect to the\nothers.\nConsider the expectation value of the product of the observables in the original\nensemble\nX\nhA1 A2 * * * AN iplhv =\n(\u22121)n(J) p(J),\nJ\n\nwhere J stands for an N -tuple j1 , . . . , jN with jk = \u00b11, n(J) is the number of\n\u22121 values in J and p(J) is the probability of achieving the indicated values of the\nobservables. Using the hypothesis of Eq. (8.11) as a constraint we now derive nontrivial inequalities satisfied by the numbers hA1 A2 * * * AN iplhv when introducing two\nalternative dichotomic observables A1i , A2i , i = 1, 2, . . . , N (here we write A1i and A2i\ninstead of Ai and A\u2032i for the dichotomic observables for party i). To simplify the\nnotation we write hi1 i2 * * * iN iplhv for hAi11 Ai22 * * * AiNN iplhv , where i1 = 1, 2 denotes\nwhich of the two dichotomic observables is chosen for party 1, etc. For any value\nof k and any choice of these k parties to comprise one of the subsystems we obtain\n(proof in the Appendix on page 198) the following inequalities:\nX\n\u00b1\nhi1 i2 * * * iN iplhv \u2264 2N \u22121 ,\n(8.12)\n\u03bdt(I)\nI\n\nwhere I = (i1 , i2 , . . . , iN ), t(I) is the number of times index 2 appears in I, and \u03bdk\u00b1\nis a sequence of signs given by\n\u03bdk\u00b1 = (\u22121)\n\nk(k\u00b11)\n2\n\n.\n\n(8.13)\n\nThese sequences have period four with cycles (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1) and (1, 1, \u22121, \u22121) respectively. We call these inequalities alternating. They are direct generalizations of\nthe three-partite inequalities by [Svetlichny, 1987]. The alternating inequalities are\nsatisfied by a system with any form of partial factorisability, so their violation is a\nsufficient indication of full non-factorisability.\n\n\fDiscerning multi-partite correlations\n\n193\n\nIntroduce now the operator\n\u00b1\nSN\n=\n\nX\nI\n\n\u00b1\n\u03bdt(I)\nAi11 * * * AiNN .\n\n(8.14)\n\nUsing Eq. (8.12) the N -partite alternating inequalities can be expressed as\n\u00b1\n|hSN\niplhv | \u2264 2N \u22121 .\n\n(8.15)\n\nFor even N the two inequalities are interchanged by a global change of labels 1 and\n2 and are thus equivalent. However for odd N this is not the case and thus they\nmust be considered a-priori independent. To see this consider the effect of such\na change upon the cycle (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1). If N is even, we get (\u22121)N/2 (1, 1, \u22121, \u22121)\nwhich gives the second alternating inequality. For N = odd, we get \u00b1(1, \u22121, \u22121, 1),\nwhich results in the same inequality. Similar results hold for the other cycle. The\ninequalities (8.15) are necessary conditions for a PLHV model to exist. It is not\nknown what a necessary and sufficient set would be.\nThe bound (8.15) for PLHV models is sharp since it can be obtained by considering for example the bi-separable partition {1, . . . , N \u2212 1} , {N } and choosing the\n\u00b1\nN \u22121\nabsolute maximum for SN\nsince there are just that many terms\n\u22121 , which is 2\n\u00b1\nin the operator SN \u22121 , and choosing hAN i = hA\u2032N i = 1 for party N .\nLet us consider the Svetlichny polynomials at closer scrutiny. The following\nrecursive relation holds:\n\u2213\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u2032\n= SN\nSN\n\u22121 AN \u2213 SN \u22121 AN ,\n\n(8.16)\n\n\u00b1\nwith S2+ = \u2212M2 and S2\u2212 = M2\u2032 . Consider the term SN\n\u22121 AN . The maximum of\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n|hSN \u22121 AN i| is equal to the maximum of |hSN \u22121 i| since max |hAN i| = 1. Similarly\nfor the other term. Thus one can take the N -partite bound as twice the (N \u2212 1)partite bound.\nThe Svetlichny polynomials SN are related to the Mermin polynomials MN by\nthe following linear recursive relations [Uffink, 2002]:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00b1\n\u2032\n, for N = odd, and N = 2 l + 1,\n= 2l\u22121 (\u22121)l(l\u00b11)/2 MN \u2213 (\u22121)l(l\u22131)/2 MN\nSN\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n,\n= 2l\u22121 (\u22121)l(l\u00b11)/2 MN\nSN\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u2032\nwhere MN\n:= MN and MN\n:= MN\n.\nThe expectation values are thus related as:\n\u001a\n\u00b1\ni|,\n2(N \u22122)/2 |hMN\n\u00b1\n|hSN\ni| =\n\u00b1\n\u2213\n(N \u22123)/2\n2\n|hMN \u00b1 MN\ni|,\n\nfor N = even, and N = 2 l,\n(8.17)\n\nif N = even,\nif N = odd.\n\n(8.18)\n\nNote that from the above relations we get the following identity:\n\u2212 2\n+ 2\n\u2032 2\ni = 2N \u22122 (hMN i2 + hMN\ni + hSN\ni ).\nhSN\n\n(8.19)\n\n\f194\n\nChapter 8\n\nHence, the quadratic separability inequalities of (6.7) for multi-partite quantum\nstates can be equally expressed in terms of operators SN . The maximal quantum\nmechanical violation the left-hand\nside of the N -partite alternating inequalities of\n\u221a\nN \u22121\n(8.15) is thus equal to 2\n2. This upper bound is in fact achieved for the GHZ\nstates for appropriate values of the polarizer angles of the relevant spin observables1.\nIn conclusion, fully entangled\nquantum states can violate the Svetlichny inequal\u221a\nities by a factor as large as 2 [Seevinck and Svetlichny, 2002; Collins et al., 2002],\nthereby proving that quantum correlations\ncontain full multi-partite non-locality.\n\u221a\nThe absolute maximum is a factor 2 larger than the maximum quantum bound.\nThus\n\u221a\n2 max |hSN iplhv | = 2 max |hSN iqm | = |SN |max = 2N .\n(8.21)\nNote that quantum mechanics can never attain the absolute maximum for the\n\u00b1\nexpectation value of the Svetlichny polynomials SN\n. This is in contradistinction\n\u2032\nto what was the case for the Mermin polynomials MN and MN\n, where for N =\nodd quantum mechanics is able to give the absolute maximum on |hMN iqm | and\n\u2032\n|hMN\niqm |. It is thus the quantum bound on the Svetlichny polynomials, and not on\nthe Mermin polynomials that distinguishes quantum correlations from more general\ncorrelations for all N .\nThe two alternating solutions for N = 2 are the usual CHSH inequalities, i.e,\n|hM2 ilhv | \u2264 2, and |hM2 i\u2032lhv | \u2264 2, where for N = 2 there is of course no distinction between a LHV and PLHV model. The ones for N = 3 give rise to the two\ninequalities found in Svetlichny [Svetlichny, 1987] that are also given in (8.7), and\nfor N = 4 we have |hS4+ iplhv | = 2|hM4 iplhv | \u2264 8 and where the second inequality is\n|hS4\u2212 iplhv | = 2|hM4\u2032 iplhv | \u2264 8.\n\n8.4.1\n\nAlternative formulation\n\nAfter Seevinck and Svetlichny [2002] announced their generalized Svetlichny inequalities Collins et al. [2002] independently announced similar inequalities. They\ndefine the following Svetlichny polynomials\n\u001a\nMN ,\nif N = even,\n(8.22)\nSeN =\n1\n\u2032\nif N = odd,\n2 (MN + MN ),\n1 The settings are obtained as follows. Let Ai = cos \u03b1i \u03c3 + sin \u03b1i \u03c3 denote spin observables\nk y\nk x\nk\nwith angle \u03b1ik in the x-y plane. A simple calculation shows\ni\n\nhi1 * * * iN iqm = \u00b1 cos(\u03b1i11 + * * * + \u03b1NN ),\n\n(8.20)\n\nwhere the sign is the sign \u221achosen in the GHZ state. We now note that for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . one\n`\n \u0301\nhas: cos \u00b1 \u03c04 + k \u03c02 = \u03bdk\u00b1 22 where \u03bdk\u00b1 is given by (8.13). This means that by a proper choice\nof angles, we can match, up to an overall sign, the sign of the cosine in (8.20) with the sign in\nfront of hi1 * * * iN i\u221a\nqm as it appears in the inequality, forcing the left-hand side of the inequality to\nbe equal to 2N\u22121 2. This can be easily done if each time an index ij changes from 1 to 2, the\n`\n \u0301 `\n \u0301\nargument of the cosine is increased by \u03c02 . Choose therefore \u03b111 , \u03b112 , . . . , \u03b11N = \u00b1 \u03c04 , 0, . . . , 0 , and\n \u0301\n` 2 2\n \u0301\n`\n\u00b1\n\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b12N = \u00b1 \u03c04 + \u03c02 , \u03c02 , . . . , \u03c02 , where the sign indicates which of the two SN inequalities\nis used.\n\n\fDiscerning multi-partite correlations\n\n195\n\ne\nand prove for N = odd: |hSeN iplhv | \u2264 2(N \u22121)/2\n\u221a , and for N = even: |hSN iplhv | \u2264\n(N \u22122)/2\n2\n. The quantum bounds are a factor 2 higher and the absolute maxima\n|SeN |max are a factor 2 higher. These bounds give the same structure as in (8.21)\n\u00b1\nwhich was obtained using the Svetlichny polynomial SN\nused here. This formulation\n(8.22) is used by Jones et al. [2005] and Marcovitch and Reznik [2007].\nAlthough using (8.22) gives a simpler recursive relation in terms of the Mermin\n\u00b1\npolynomials than was the case for SN\nas given in (8.17), the bounds for SeN now\ndepend on whether N is even or odd, which we regard to be an unwelcome feature.\n\n8.5\n\nFurther remarks on quantum mechanical\nviolations\n\nWe have seen that using N -partite\n\u221a GHZ states the Svetlichny inequalities can be\nviolated by as large as a factor 2. The GHZ states are fully entangled and this\nfull entanglement is a necessary feature to give a violation. This follows from the\nfact that (6.7) of chapter 6 shows (using the identity (8.19)) that any bi-separable\n\u00b1\n(N \u22123/2)\nstate (i.e.,\n, which is a\n\u221a k = 2) has a maximal value for hSN iqm equal to 2\nfactor 2 below the PLHV bound as given in (8.15). Thus a 'gap' appears between\nthe correlations that can be obtained by bi-separable quantum states and those\nobtainable by PLHV models. It thus takes fully entangled states to obtain all the\ncorrelations obtainable by a PLHV model. This is analogous to the results found\nin section 6.3.3.4 for the LHV case, where it was shown that one needs entangled\nstates to give all the correlations that are producible by LHV models.\nThese results imply that the mere requirement of locality (factorisability) between just two subsets, although within each subset full blown non-locality is admissible, already forces the correlations to be less strong than some of the quantum\nmechanical correlations, although they are nevertheless still stronger than those\nobtainable from bi-separable quantum states.\nAn interesting question to ask next is whether the N -partite non-locality that is\nfound in the fully entangled GHZ states is generic or whether it can only be found\nin some specific states. That is, can we generalize the observation that N -party\nentangled pure states contain 2-partite non-locality [Gisin and Peres, 1992; Gisin,\n1991; Popescu and Rohrlich, 1992a] (any such state can be made to violate the\nCHSH inequality for some set of observables) so as to be able to claim that all fully\nentangled pure states are fully non-local? This question is still open. However,\nfor mixed states this probably does not hold. Indeed, fully entangled mixed states\nexist that cannot be made to violate the Svetlichny inequality, as we will now show.\n\n8.5.1\n\nHidden full non-locality?\n\nLet us consider the GHZ states mixed with white noise, notated as:\nN\nN\n\u03c1N = (1 \u2212 p)| \u03c8GHZ,\u03b1\nih \u03c8GHZ,\u03b1\n| + p 1/2N ,\n\n(8.23)\n\n\f196\n\nChapter 8\n\nwith 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1. The white noise robustness of the GHZ states so as to exhibit\nfull non-locality is obtaining by determining for which value of p the \u221a\nSvetlichny\ninequalities can be violated. It is easily found that this gives p < 1 \u2212 1/ 2 \u2248 0.29.\nWe already know that for p < 1/(2(1 \u2212 2\u2212N )) this set is fully N -partite entangled\n(it violates the sufficient criterion of (6.53), cf. (6.87)). For N = 3 \u221a\nthis gives\np < 4/7 and for large N this goes to p < 1/2. Consequently, for 1 \u2212 1/ 2 < p <\n1/(2(1 \u2212 2\u2212N )) the set \u03c1N is fully N -partite entangled, but nevertheless cannot be\nmade to violate the Svetlichny inequality (8.15).\nNote however, that does result not prove that these states are not fully non-local\nsince the Svetlichny inequalities are not sufficient for a PLHV model to exist, i.e.,\nthey are only necessary requirements. What it does show is that in case these states\nare fully non-local (to be shown by some other method), this non-locality cannot\nbe revealed using a Svetlichny inequality. If such states indeed exist, they contain\nwhat we propose to call 'hidden full non-locality'. This terminology is motivated\nby an analogous feature for the two-partite case: bi-partite states exist that are\nentangled and which have a local model for all measurements using two dichotomic\nobservables per party (and thus cannot violate the CHSH inequality) whose nonlocality can nevertheless be revealed using a local filtering process. Popescu [1995]\ncalled these 'hidden nonlocal'.\n\nExperiments indicating full non-locality in a quantum system\nAlthough the experiment by Pan et al. [2000] did create full three-qubit entanglement, as was argued for in section 6.3.2, it is unclear if full non-locality was\nexperimentally produced, since no violation of a three-partite Svetlichny inequality\nhas been tested. However for N = 4, such a violation is reported by Zhao et al.\n[2003] since there the Svetlichny inequality using S4+ = M4 was violated using a\nGHZ state, which confirms full four-partite non-locality.\n\n8.6\n\nOn discriminating no-signaling correlations\nusing expectation values only\n\nWe have seen that quantum mechanics cannot\n\u221a maximally violate the Svetlichny\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\ninequalities, i.e., max |hSN\niqm | = |SN\n|max / 2. Thus the inequalities obtained\nfrom the Svetlichny polynomials allow for distinguishing quantum correlations from\nmore general correlations, something the Mermin polynomials were unable to do\nfor odd N . However, the Svetlichny polynomials unfortunately do not distinguish\nno-signaling correlations from the most general correlations, for it is the case that\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nmax |hSN\nins | = |SN\n|max , as proven by Jones et al. [2005]. Thus no non-trivial bound\nfor the no-signaling correlations is obtained.\nOf course, the defining conditions of no-signaling themselves give the facets of\nthe no-signaling polytope. However, we believe it is interesting to ask for non-trivial\n\n\fDiscerning multi-partite correlations\n\n197\n\ninequalities in terms of product expectation values hA1 * * * AN i despite the fact that\nthese cannot be facets of the no-signaling polytope. For N = 2 we were able to find\nsuch a set of Bell-type inequalities (in section 3.5.2) and for N = 3 it was argued\nin the previous chapter that the monogamy inequality (7.7) is able to discriminate\nno-signaling from general three-partite correlations. But for N > 3 no such Belltype inequalities or monogamy inequalities are known to exist. We thus leave as\nan open question the search for non-trivial no-signaling Bell-type inequalities in\nterms of product expectation values for N > 3. The Svetlichny polynomials use all\npossible combinations of the products A1 A2 * * * AN for all A1 , . . . , AN . It does not\n\u00b1\nseem likely that, when compared to SN\n, using different linear combinations of these\nterms with coefficients \u00b11 will help. One must thus probably resort to including\nmarginal expectation values that have less than N terms, just as was the case in\nfor example the bi-partite inequalities (3.66). It might furthermore be necessary\nto allow for more than just two local settings or for more than just two possible\noutcomes per observable. We expect that the method used in the bi-partite case\nthat gave the non-trivial no-signaling inequalities (3.66) and (3.68) generalizes to\nthe multi-partite case, but we have not performed such a generalization.\n\n8.7\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe multi-partite investigation of discriminating partially-local, quantum mechanical and no-signaling correlations has given us many results, but some interesting\nquestions remain unsolved, as we will now discuss.\nIn this chapter we have derived Bell-type inequalities \u2013 which we have called\nSvetlichny inequalities \u2013 that discriminate partially-local correlations from quantum correlations, and also quantum correlations from no-signaling correlations. It\nis however unknown if these inequalities are tight, i.e., if they give facets of the\npartially-local polytope. It would be interesting to try and find the full set of tight\nSvetlichny inequalities for N parties, although this might be a computationally hard\nproblem. For three parties, however, it is likely that this problem is computationally\ntractable.\nThe Svetlichny inequalities do not discriminate no-signaling correlations from\ngeneral unrestricted correlations. For no-signaling correlations no non-trivial bound\nexists on the expectation value of the Svetlichny polynomials. Providing such discriminating conditions for multi-partite no-signaling correlations (N > 3) in terms\nof product expectation values (possibly including some marginal expectation values)\nis left as an open problem.\nFully entangled quantum states were shown to violate the Svetlichny inequality,\nthereby showing that they are fully non-local: no PLHV model can give rise to these\nquantum correlations. However, we showed that fully entangled mixed states exist\nthat cannot be made to violate the inequalities. Their full non-locality, if indeed\npresent, thus needs to be shown in a different, yet hitherto unknown way.\nLastly, we note that Jones et al. [2005] consider a class of models more general\n\n\f198\n\nChapter 8\n\nthan we have considered here, and they showed that these models must still obey the\nSvetlichny inequalities. The models they considered did not impose partial locality\non the correlations, but allowed for specific fully non-local correlations that follow\nfrom a so-called partially paired communication graph which represents a specific\nsignaling pattern between all of the parties. It was shown that these models can\nnot be made to violate the Svetlichny inequalities. Thus the non-locality needed\nin obtaining a violation of the Svetlichny inequalities must be stronger than the\nnon-locality of these partially paired communication graphs. Because quantum mechanics violates the Svetlichny inequalities, Jones et al. [2005] interpret their result\nas indicating that quantum correlations are much more non-local than previously\nthought.\n\nAppendix: Proof of inequality (8.12)\nWe seek inequalities of the form\nX\n\u03c3I hi1 i2 * * * iN iplhv \u2264 M,\n\n(8.24)\n\nI\n\nwhere \u03c3I is a sign and M non-trivial.

Taking into account that \u03c3I2 = 1, and denoting by I\u02c6 the (N \u22121)-tuple\n(i1 , . . . , iN \u22121 ) we have:\nX\nm\u03c3 = max\n(8.26)\n\u03c3I1\n\u02c6 \u03b7ik+1 ***iN \u22121 1 \u03bei1 ***ik (1 + \u03c3I1\n\u02c6 \u03c3I2\n\u02c6 \u03b6ik+1 ***iN \u22121 ).\nI\u02c6\n\nThe maximum being over \u03bei1 ***ik , \u03b7ik+1 ***iN \u22121 1 , and \u03b6ik+1 ***iN \u22121 .\nNow certainly one has\nX\nm\u03c3 \u2264 m\u0302\u03c3 = max\n|1 + \u03c3I1\n\u02c6 \u03b6ik+1 ***iN \u22121 |,\n\u02c6 \u03c3I2\n\n(8.27)\n\nI\u02c6\n\nthe maximum taken over \u03b6ik+1 ***iN \u22121 .\nIf we define m\u0302 = min\u03c3 m\u0302\u03c3 one easily sees that m\u0302 = 2N \u22121 . This can only be\nachieved under the following condition:\nFor each fixed (ik+1 , . . . , iN \u22121 ) exactly 2k\u22121\nk\u22121\nof the quantities \u03c3I1\nare \u2212 1.\n\u02c6 \u03c3I2\n\u02c6 are + 1 and 2\n\n(8.28)\n\n\fDiscerning multi-partite correlations\n\n199\n\nAlthough it may be that m < m\u0302 we have proven that m = m\u0302 = 8 in all cases for\nN = 4, and m = m\u0302 for k = N \u2212 1 for any N .\nWe shall call any choice of the \u03c3I satisfying this condition a minimal solution.\nWhat immediately follows from the above is that any solution of (8.28) for a\ngiven value of P is a solution for all greater values of k \u2264 N \u2212 1. A violation of\nan inequality so obtained for the smallest possible value of k \u2265 N/2 precludes then\nany PLHV model of the N -partite correlations.\nAssume provisionally that only bi-partitions {1, . . . , k}, {N \u2212 k, . . . , N } occurs.\nThe whole ensemble consists of subensembles corresponding to different choices of\nthe k parties. We do not know in any particular system to which of the subensembles\nthe system belongs. To take account of this, our inequality must be one that would\narise under any choice of the k parties. Call a minimal solution \u03c3I admissible if\n\u03c3\u03c0(I) is also a minimal solution for any permutation \u03c0. An inequality that follows\nfrom an admissible solution will therefore be one that must be satisfied by any\nsubensemble of systems with split {1, . . . , k}, {N \u2212 k, . . . , N }.\nThe set of admissible solutions breaks up into orbits by the action of the permutation group. The overall sign of \u03c3I is not significant and two solutions that\ndiffer by a sign are considered equivalent. The set of these equivalence classes also\nbreaks up into orbits by the action of the permutation group. It is remarkable that\nthere are orbits consisting of one equivalence class only. For such, one must have\n\u03c3\u03c0(I) = \u00b1\u03c3I . The sign in front of the right-hand side must be a one-dimensional\nrepresentation of the permutation group, so one must have either \u03c3\u03c0(I) = \u03c3I or\n\u03c3\u03c0(I) = (\u22121)s(\u03c0) \u03c3I , where s(\u03c0) is the parity of \u03c0. The second case is impossible\nsince one then would have \u03c311***1 = \u2212\u03c311***1 as a result of a flip permutation. Since\nan overall sign is not significant one can now fix \u03c311***1 = 1. As the only permutation invariant of I is t(I), the number of times index 2 appears in I, we must have\n\u03c3I = \u03bdt(I) for some (N + 1)-tuple (\u03bd0 = 1 by convention) \u03bd = (1, \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , . . . , \u03bdN ).\nWe must now solve for the possible values of \u03bd.\nLet a = t(ik+1 * * * iN \u22121 ) and b = t(i1 * * * ik ), then condition (8.28) for our choice\nof \u03c3I , is equivalent to \u03bd satisfying\n\u0013\nk \u0012\nX\nk\n\u03bda+b \u03bda+b+1 = 0,\nb\nb=0\n\na = 0, 1, . . .

N \u2212 k \u2212 1.\n\n(8.30)\n\nNow it is obvious that there are at least two solutions of (8.30) valid for all k,\nto wit \u03bck = \u00b1(\u22121)k since then (8.30) is just the expansion of (1 \u2212 1)k or (\u22121 + 1)k .\nCall these solutions the alternating solutions. Finally we get from \u03bck = \u03bdk \u03bdk+1 the\ntwo solutions (8.13) once we've chosen the overall sign to set \u03bd0 = 1.\n\n\f\fIV\n\nQuantum philosophy\n\n\f\fChapter 9\n\n203\n\nThe quantum world is not built up\nfrom correlations\nThis chapter is a slightly adapted version of Seevinck [2006].\n\n9.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is quantum mechanics about? This question has haunted the physics community ever since the conception of the theory in the 1920's. Since the work of J.S. Bell\nwe know at least that quantum mechanics is not about a local realistic structure\nbuilt up out of values of physical quantities [Bell, 1964]. This is because of the well\nknown fact, that if one considers the values of physical quantities to be locally real\n(i.e., if they are to obey the doctrine of local realism), then they must obey a local\nBell-type inequality, which quantum mechanics violates. The paradigmatic example\nof a quantum system that gives such a violation is the singlet state of two spin- 21\nparticles. This state describes two particles that are anti-correlated in spin. Bell's\nresult shows that the two particles in the singlet state cannot be regarded to possess\nlocal realistic1 values for all their (single particle) physical quantities, values which\ndo not vary depending on what one does to another spatially separated system. Instead, the singlet state tells us that upon measurement the spin values, if measured\nin the same direction on each particle, will always be found anti-parallel. Because\nthis (anti-) correlation is found in all such measurements, an obvious question to\nask is whether or not we can think of this (anti-) correlation as a real property of\nthe two-particle system independent of measurement.\nCould it be that what is real about two systems in the singlet state are not the\nlocal spin values, but merely the correlations between the two systems? Is quantum\nmechanics about a physical world consisting not of systems that have objective\n1 The adjective 'local realistic' is to be understood as obeying the doctrine of local realism, cf.\nchapter 3.\n\n\f204\n\nChapter 9\n\nlocal realistic values of quantities but solely of objective local realistic correlations,\nof which some are non-contextually revealed in experiment? In other words, is there\na fundamental difference according to quantum mechanics as regards the physical\nstatus of values of quantities and of correlations, as for example Mermin2 seems to\nsuggest?\nThere is good reason to think that these questions should be answered in the positive, since a non-trivial theorem (which is true in quantum mechanics) points into\nthis direction. The theorem (to be treated in the next section) shows that the global\nstate of a composite quantum system can be completely determined by specifying\ncorrelations (i.e., joint probability distributions) when sufficient local measurements\nare performed on each subsystem. It thus suffices to consider only correlations between measurements performed on subsystems only in order to completely specify\nthe state of the composite system. But can one also think of these correlations to\nbe objective properties that pertain local realistically to the composite quantum\nsystem in question? As mentioned before in the case of the anti-correlation of the\nsinglet state, one is tempted to think that this is indeed the case. However in\nthis chapter we will demonstrate that, however tempting, no such interpretation is\npossible and that these questions (as well as the questions mentioned earlier) can\nthus not be answered in the positive. This is shown using a Bell-type inequality\nargument which shows that the correlations cannot be regarded as objective properties constrained by local realism that somehow pertain to the composite system\nin question. Our strategy is analogous to the one Bell adopted when he showed that\nin quantum mechanics one cannot have values for all physical quantities that are\ndetermined via deterministic or stochastic local hidden variables. We extend Bell's\nanalysis by showing that this is also impossible for correlations among subsystems\nof an individual isolated composite system. Neither of them can be used to build\nup a world consisting of some local realistic structure3 .\nCabello [1999] and Jordan [1999] give the same answer to similar questions using\na Kochen-Specker-type [Kochen and Specker, 1967], Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) -type [Greenberger et al., 1989, 1990] or Hardy-type [Hardy, 1993] argument.\nBesides giving the Bell-type inequality version of the argument (which in a sense\ncompletes the discussion because it was still lacking), the advantage of the argument\ngiven in this chapter above these previous arguments, is that it is more easily\nexperimentally accessible using current technology. For this purpose, we explicitly\npresent a quantum state and the measurements that are to be performed in order\nto test the inequality.\nThe structure of this chapter is as follows. In sec. 9.2 we will present an\nargument to the effect that quantum correlations are objective local properties that\n2 N.D. Mermin, in a series of papers [Mermin, 1998a, 1999, 1998b], tried to defend this fundamental interpretational difference between values of quantities and correlations. He used the\nphrase 'correlations without correlata' for this position.\n3 This is not to be understood as a claim which is supposed to show the impossibility of defining\nlocal elements of reality, but as one that shows the impossibility of these elements of reality to\nobey the doctrine of local realism when required to reproduce the quantum predictions.\n\n\fThe quantum world and correlations\n\n205\n\npertain to composite quantum systems and that do not vary depending on what\none does to another, spatially separated system. In the next two sections we will\nhowever show that this line of thought is in conflict with quantum mechanics itself.\nTo get such a conclusive result we need to be very formal and rigorous. In sec. 9.3\nwe will therefore define our notion of correlation and derive a Bell-type inequality\nfor correlations using a stochastic hidden-variable model under the assumption of\nlocal realism. This formalizes the idea of correlations as objective local realistic\nproperties. In sec. 9.4 we show that this inequality, when turned into it's quantum\nmechanical form, is violated by quantum correlations. We present a quantum state\nand a set of measurements that allow for such a violation and furthermore show\nthat it is the maximum possible violation.\nIn sec. 9.5 we apply this result to argue that entanglement cannot be considered\nontologically robust when the quantum state is taken to be a complete description\nof the system in question. We present four conditions that arguably can be regarded\nas necessary conditions for ontological robustness of entanglement and show that\nthey are all four violated by quantum mechanics. However, we argue that it nevertheless can be considered a resource in quantum information theory to perform\ncomputational and information-theoretic tasks. In the last section, sec. 9.6, we\nbriefly discuss the implications of our results, compare our argument to the ones\ngiven by Cabello [1999] and by Jordan [1999] and return to the questions stated in\nthe beginning of this introduction.\n\n9.2\n\nDoes the quantum world consist of\ncorrelations?\n\nIn many important instances a system can be regarded as composed out of separate\nsubsystems. In a physical theory that describes such composite systems it can be\nasked whether one can assume that the global state of the system can be completely\ndetermined by specifying correlations (joint probability distributions) when a sufficient number of local4 measurements are performed on each subsystem. Barrett\n[2007] calls this the global state assumption. Perhaps not surprisingly, the assumption holds for classical probability theory and for quantum mechanics on a complex\nHilbert space. However, it need not be satisfied in an arbitrary theory, which shows\nthat the theorem is non-trivial. For example, Wootters [1990] has shown that for\nquantum mechanics on a real Hilbert space the assumption does not hold because\nthe correlations between subsystems do not suffice to build up the total state. By\ncounting available degrees of freedom of the state of a composite system and of the\n4 Note that here (and in the rest of the chapter) 'local' is taken to be opposed to 'global' and\nthus not in the sense of spatial localization. Local thus refers to being confined to a subsystem of\na larger system, without requiring the subsystem itself to be localized (it can thus itself exist of\nspatially separated parts).\n\n\f206\n\nChapter 9\n\nstates of its subsystems one can easily convince oneself that this is the case5 .\nMermin [1998a] has called the fact that in quantum mechanics the global state\nassumption holds sufficiency of subsystems correlations, or the SSC theorem. He\nphrases it as follows. Given a system S = S1 + S2 with density matrix \u03c1, then \u03c1 is\ncompletely determined by correlations P (a, b|A, B) (joint probability distributions\nconditioned on the settings chosen, see section 2.2.5) that determine the mean\nP\nvalues hA \u2297 Biqm = Tr[\u03c1(A \u2297 B)] =\na,b ab P (ab|AB), for an appropriate set\n6\nof observable pairs {A}, {B}. The proof relies on three facts: Firstly, the mean\nvalues of all observables for the entire system determine its state. Secondly, the\nset of all products over subsystems of subsystem observables (i.e., the set {A \u2297 B})\ncontains a basis for the algebra of all such system-wide observables. Thirdly, the\nalgorithm that supplies observables with their mean value is linear on the algebra\nof observables.\nAs an example\nthe well known singlet state | \u03c8 \u2212 i =\n\u221a of the theorem, consider\n1\n(| 01i \u2212 | 10i)/ 2 of two qubits (spin- 2 particles) written as the one-dimensional\nprojection operator\nP\u0302s = | \u03c8 \u2212 ih \u03c8 \u2212 | =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z \u2212 \u03c3x \u2297 \u03c3x \u2212 \u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ).\n4\n\n(9.1)\n\nThe mean value of P\u0302s is determined by the mean values of the products of the x, y\nand z components of the individual spins:\nhP\u0302s iqm =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 h\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z iqm \u2212 h\u03c3x \u2297 \u03c3x iqm \u2212 h\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y iqm ).\n4\n\n(9.2)\n\nSince the mean value of this projector is 1 for the singlet, the singlet state is thus\ndetermined by the spin correlations in x, y and z direction having the value \u22121\nfor h\u03c3z \u2297 \u03c3z iqm , h\u03c3x \u2297 \u03c3x iqm and h\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y iqm ) which is perfect anti-correlation in\nall these three directions. Because of rotational invariance of the singlet state one\ncan choose any three orthogonal x, y and z directions. Perfect anti-correlation of\nany three orthogonal components is thus enough to ensure that the global state\nis the singlet state. Thus correlations among all subsystems completely determine\nthe density matrix for the composite system they make up, or in Mermin's words\n[Mermin, 1999]: \"anything you can say in terms of quantum states can be translated\ninto a statement about subsystem correlations, i.e., about joint distributions.\" Note\nthat while these correlations are relational properties of the two individual systems\n(i.e., qubits), they are taken to be intrinsic properties of the joint system composed\nof the two qubits, as the possession of the correlation properties by the joint system\n5 J.\n\nBarrett (private communication) gives the following counting argument. A density matrix\non a real Hilbert space with dimension d has M = (d2 \u2212 d)/2 + d = (1/2)d(d + 1) parameters\n(without normalization), and a density matrix on a d \u2297 d-dimensional real Hilbert space has\n(1/2)d2 (d2 + 1) parameters, which is too many because it is more than M 2 . On the other hand,\nfor complex Hilbert spaces we have that a density matrix has N = d2 real parameters. So a density\nmatrix on a d \u2297 d-dimensional complex Hilbert space has d4 real parameters which is indeed N 2 .\n6 Wootters [1990] has also independently proven this.\n\n\fThe quantum world and correlations\n\n207\n\ndoes not, we may suppose, depend on any relation the joint system has to any\nfurther (possibly spatially separated) systems.\nIt is tempting to think that because of this SSC theorem and because of the\nfact that Bell has shown that a quantum state is not a prescription of local realistic\nvalues of physical quantities, that we can take a quantum state to be nothing but\nthe encapsulation of all the quantum correlations present in the quantum system.\nIndeed, the SSC theorem was used by Mermin [1998a, 1999, 1998b] to argue for the\nidea that correlations are physically real and give a local realistic underpinning of\nquantum mechanics, whereas values of quantities do not (although by now he has\nset these ideas aside7 ). Without wanting to claim that Mermin is committed to the\nissue we address next, we explore if correlations between subsystems of an individual\nisolated composed system, although determining the state of the total composite\nsystem, can also be be considered to be real objective local properties of such a\nsystem. That is, can one consider quantum correlations to be properties obeying\nthe doctrine of local realism that somehow (pre-)exist in the quantum state? Are\ncorrelations somehow atomic local realistic building blocks of the (quantum) world?\nIn the next two sections we will show that none of these questions can be answered in the positive. The supposition we made above that the correlations of\nthe composite two-qubit system in the singlet state are intrinsic to this two-qubit\nsystem and thus do not depend on the relation this system has to a further possibly\nspatially separated system turns out to be false. Therefore, and arguably surprisingly, they cannot be regarded to be local realistic properties. We will be formal\nand rigorous and follow the road paved by Bell for us, but enlarge it to not only\ninclude values of quantities but also correlations.\n\n9.3\n\nA Bell-type inequality for correlations between\ncorrelations\n\nConsider two spatially separated parties I and II which each have a bi-partite\nsystem. Furthermore, assume that each party determines the correlations of the\nbi-partite system at his side. By correlations we here mean the conditional joint\nprobability distributions P I (ab|AB) and P II (cd|CD), where A and B are physical\nquantities each associated to one of the subsystems in the bi-partite system that\nparty I has, and where a and b denote the possible values these quantities can\nobtain. The same holds for quantities C, D and possible outcomes c, d but then\nfor party II. We now assume local realism for these correlations in the following\nwell-known way. The correlations party I finds are determined by some hidden\nvariable \u03bb \u2208 \u039b (with distribution \u03c1(\u03bb) and hidden-variable space \u039b). The same\nof course holds for II. We next look at the relationship correlations within each\nof I and II have with the correlations possessed by the total system composed\nof I and II, i.e., we consider correlations between the correlations P I (ab|AB) and\n7 N.D.\n\nMermin, personal communication.\n\n\f208\n\nChapter 9\n\nP II (cd|CD). Because of locality the correlations one party will obtain are for a given\n\u03bb statistically independent of the correlations that the other party will find. Under\nthese assumptions the joint probability distribution that encodes the correlations\nbetween the correlations factorises, i.e.,\nP (ab, cd|AB, CD, \u03bb) = P I (ab|AB, \u03bb) P II (cd|CD, \u03bb),\n\n(9.3)\n\nso as to give8\nP (ab, cd|AB, CD) =\n\nZ\n\nP I (ab|AB, \u03bb) P II (cd|CD, \u03bb) \u03bc(\u03bb) d\u03bb.\n\n(9.4)\n\n\u039b\n\nHere we assume a so-called stochastic hidden-variable model where the hiddenvariables \u03bb determine only the correlations P I (ab|AB, \u03bb), P II (cd|CD, \u03bb), and not\nthe values a,b,c,d of the quantities A,B,C,D. Neither does it determine the probabilities for these values to be found. Thus the correlations P I (ab|AB, \u03bb) and\nP II (cd|CD, \u03bb) itself need not factorise (if they would factorise one obtains the familiar situation of local realism for values of quantities).\nSuppose now that we deal with dichotomic quantities A, B, C, D with possible\noutcomes a, b, c, d \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. We denote the mean value of the product of the tuples\nAB and CD by\nX\nhAB, CDilc =\nabcd P (ab, cd|AB, CD)\n(9.5)\na,b,c,d\n\nwhere the subscript 'lc' stands for 'local correlations', indicating that the joint\ndistribution P (ab, cd|AB, CD) is given by (9.4) that encodes the idea of local realism\nfor correlations.\nThen because of the factorisability in (9.4) we get the following Bell-type inequality, in familiar CHSH form,\n|hAB, CDilc + hAB, (CD)\u2032 ilc + h(AB)\u2032 , CDilc \u2212 h(AB)\u2032 , (CD)\u2032 ilc | \u2264 2.\n\n(9.6)\n\nHere AB, (AB)\u2032 denote two sets of quantities that give rise to two different joint\nprobabilities (i.e., correlations) at party I. Similarly for the set CD and (CD)\u2032 at\nparty II.\nThis is a Bell-type inequality which relates the correlations between I and II to\nthe correlations within each of I and II. In the next section we show that quantum\nmechanics violates it by a suitably chosen entangled state of the composite system\ncomprising both I and II. Despite the resemblance between our inequality and the\nusual CHSH inequality, they are fundamentally different because the latter is in\nterms of correlations between values of subsystem quantities whereas the former is\nin terms of correlations between correlations and does not assume anything about\nthe values of subsystem quantities.\n8 For clarity we group the outcomes and observables for both parties together in the probability\nP (ab, cd|AB, CD), etc.\n\n\fThe quantum world and correlations\n\n9.4\n\n209\n\nQuantum correlations are not local elements\nof reality\n\nConsider a four-partite quantum system O that consists of two pairs of qubits (spin1\n2 particles) where parties I and II each receive a single pair. In this section we will\nprovide an entangled state of the four-qubit quantum system O and specific sets of\ntwo-qubit observables each performed by parties I and II (that each have a pair\nof qubits) with the following property: These observables give rise to correlations\nin the two-qubit subsystems, which violate the Bell-type inequality of the previous\nsection (see (9.6)) in its quantum mechanical version, which is\n|hBiqm | = |hAB, CDiqm + hAB, (CD)\u2032 iqm\n\n+ h(AB)\u2032 , CDiqm \u2212 h(AB)\u2032 , (CD)\u2032 iqm | \u2264 2.\n\n(9.7)\n\nwhere B is the corresponding Bell polynomial B = AB \u2297 CD + AB \u2297 (CD)\u2032 +\n(AB)\u2032 \u2297 CD \u2212 (AB)\u2032 \u2297 (CD)\u2032 .\nNow that we have the quantum mechanical version of the Bell-type inequality in\nterms of correlations between correlations, we will provide an example of a violation\nof it. Consider two sets of two dichotomic observables represented by self-adjoint\noperators X, X \u2032 and Y, Y \u2032 for party I and II respectively. Each observable acts on\nthe subspace H = C2 \u2297 C2 of the two-qubit system held by the respective party I or\nII. These observables are chosen to be dichotomous, i.e. to have possible outcomes\nin {\u22121, 1}. They are furthermore chosen to be sums of projection operators and\nthus give rise to unique joint probability distributions on the set of quantum states.\nMeasuring these observables thus implies determining some quantum correlations.\nFor these observables X, X \u2032 , Y and Y \u2032 the Bell operator B on H = C2 \u2297C2 \u2297C2 \u2297C2\nbecomes B = X \u2297Y +X \u2297Y \u2032 +X \u2032 \u2297Y \u2212X \u2032 \u2297Y \u2032 . The observables have the following\nform.

This\nviolation proves that quantum correlations cannot be considered to be local elements\nof reality that pertain to a composite quantum system.\nThe violation is the maximum value\nbecause Tsirelson's inequality [Tsirelson,\n\u221a\n1980] (i.e., |hBiqm | = |Tr[B\u03c1]| \u2264 2 2 for all quantum states \u03c1) must hold for all\ndichotomic observables X, X \u2032 , Y, Y \u2032 on H = C2 \u2297 C2 (possible outcomes in {\u22121, 1}).\nOne can easily see this because for X, X \u2032 , Y, Y \u2032 we have that X 2 = X \u20322 = Y 2 =\nY \u20322 = 1, and it thus follows that the proof of Landau [1987] of Tsirelson's inequality\ngoes through.\n\n9.5\n\nEntanglement is not ontologically robust\n\nEntanglement is the fact that certain quantum states of a composite system exist\nthat are not convex sums of product states (cf. section 2.3.2.1). The SSC theorem of section 9.2 tells us that quantum states, and thus also their entanglement,\ncan be completely characterized by the quantum correlations that it gives rise to.\nTherefore the result of the previous section also applies to entanglement. Then, if\none considers the quantum state description to be complete, entanglement cannot\nbe viewed as ontologically robust in the sense of being an objective local realistic\nproperty pertaining to some composite system. If one would do so nevertheless, one\ncan construct a composite system that contains as a subsystem the entanglement\n(i.e. the entangled system) in question and which would allow for a violation of the\nBell-type inequality (9.7). This implies (contra the assumption) that the entanglement cannot be regarded in a local realistic way, which we take to be a necessary\ncondition for ontological robustness.\n9 This\n\nparticular choice of observables X, X \u2032 , Y , Y \u2032 on H = C2 \u2297 C2 is motivated by a wellknown choice of single particle observables that\n\u221a gives a maximum violation of the original CHSH\ninequality when\n| \u03c6+\u221a\ni = 1/ 2(| 00i + | 11i). This choice is X = \u2212\u03c3x , X \u2032 =\n\u221a using the state\n\u03c3z , Y = 1/ 2(\u2212\u03c3z + \u03c3x ), Y \u2032 = 1/ 2(\u03c3z + \u03c3x ) all on H = C2 . The analogy can be seen by\nnoting that in this latter choice the (unnormalized)\nX are | 0i + | 1i, | 0i \u2212 | 1i, of\n\u221a eigenvectors of \u221a\nX \u2032 they are | 0i,\u221a| 1i, of Y they are | \u221a\n0i + (1 + 2)| 1i, | 0i + (1 \u2212 2)| 1i and finally of Y \u2032 they\nare | 0i + (\u22121 + 2)| 1i, | 0i + (\u22121 \u2212 2)| 1i.\n\n\fThe quantum world and correlations\n\n211\n\nIt is possible that one thinks that the requirement of local realism is too strong\na requirement for ontological robustness. However, that one cannot think of entanglement as a property which has some ontological robustness can already be seen\nusing the following weaker requirement: anything which is ontologically robust can,\nwithout interaction, not be mixed away, nor swapped to another object, nor flowed\nirretrievably away into some environment. Precisely these features are possible\nin the case of entanglement and thus even the weaker requirement for ontological\nrobustness does not hold.\nThese features show up at the level of quantum states when considering a quantum system in conjunction with other quantum systems: entanglement can (i) be\ncreated in previously non-interacting particles using swapping, (ii) be mixed away\nand (iii) flow into some environment upon mixing, all without interaction between\nthe subsystems in question. It is this latter point, the fact that no interaction is\nnecessary in these processes, that one cannot think of entanglement as ontologically\nrobust.\nTo see that the above weaker requirement for ontological robustness of entanglement does not hold consider the following examples of the three above mentioned\nfeatures.\n(i) Consider two maximally entangled pairs (e.g., two singlets) that are created\nat spacelike separation, where from each pair a particle is emitted such that these\ntwo meet and the other particle of each pair is emitted such that they fly away\nin opposite directions. Conditional on a suitable joint measurement performed on\nthe pair of particles that will meet (a so called Bell-state measurement) the state\nof the remaining two particles, although they have never previously interacted nor\nare entangled initially, will be 'thrown' into a maximally entangled state. The\nentanglement is swapped [\u017bukowski et al., 1993].\n(ii) Equally mixing the two maximally entangled Bell states | \u03c8 \u00b1 i gives the\nseparable mixed state\n\u03c1 = (P| \u03c8+ i + P| \u03c8\u2212 i )/2 = (P| 01i + P| 10i )/2.\n\n(9.14)\n\nThe entanglement is thus mixed away, without any necessary interaction between\nthe subsystems.\n(iii) Equally mixing the following two states of three spin 1/2 particles, where\nparticles 2 and 3 are entangled in both states,\n| \u03c8i = | 0i \u2297 | \u03c8 \u2212 i,\n\n| \u03c6i = | 1i \u2297 | \u03c8 + i,\n\n(9.15)\n\ngives the state\n\u03c1 = (| \u03c8ih \u03c8| + | \u03c6ih \u03c6|)/2 = (P0 \u2297 P| \u03c8\u2212 i + P1 \u2297 P| \u03c8+ i )/2.\n\n(9.16)\n\nThis three-particle state is two-particle entangled although it has no two-particle\nsubsystem whose (reduced) state is entangled (cf. section 6.2). The bi-partite entanglement has thus irretrievably flowed into the three particle state, again without\nany necessary interaction between the subsystems.\n\n\f212\n\nChapter 9\n\nAnother argument against the ontological robustness of entanglement \u2013 not further studied here \u2013 is that it is not relativistically invariant because a state that\nis entangled in some inertial frame becomes less entangled (measured using the socalled logarithmic negativity) if the observers are relatively accelerated, and in the\nlimit of infinite acceleration it can even vanish [Fuentes-Schuller and Mann, 2005].\nDoes this lack of ontological robustness of entanglement question the widespread\nidea of entanglement as a resource for quantum information and computation tasks?\nWe think it does not. Quantum information theory is precisely a theory devised\nto deal with the surprising characteristics of entanglement such as the ontologically\nnon-robustness here advocated (and many other features, such as for example teleportation). Entanglement is taken to a be specific type of correlation that can be\nused as a resource for encoding and manipulating (quantum) bits of information.\nFor that purpose the ontological status of the information or of that which bears\nthe information does not matter. The only thing that matters is that one can manipulate systems that behave in a specific quantum-like way (of which it is said to\nbe due to entanglement) according to certain information theoretic rules. Whether\nthe systems indeed contain entanglement in some ontologically robust sense is irrelevant.\nTo conclude this section we should mention that Timpson and Brown [2005] do\nargue for the ontological robustness of entanglement in the mixing case (ii) above by\nintroducing ontological relevance to the preparation procedure of a quantum state,\nwhich supposedly can always be captured in the full quantum mechanical description. They introduce the distinction between 'improper' and 'proper separability',\nwhich is analogous to the well known distinction between proper and improper mixtures, to argue that one can retain an ontologically robust notion of entanglement.\nThey thus call the separable mixed state (9.14) improperly separable because the\nentanglement in the mixture becomes hidden on mixing (i.e, it disappears), although\nthere are some extra facts of the matter that tell that the separable state is in fact\ncomposed out of an ensemble of entangled states. Because of the existence of these\nextra facts of the matter \"there need be no mystery at the conceptual level over the\ndisappearance\" [Timpson and Brown, 2005, sec. 2]. We agree, and the introduced\ndistinction between proper and improper separability indeed shows this. However,\nwe are not convinced that their analysis of the improperly separable states indicates\nontological robustness of entanglement.\nThe issue at stake hinges on what one takes to be necessary and/or sufficient\nconditions for ontological robustness. Consider a state that is improperly separable\nand which thus consists of a mixture of entangled states. If one would take the\nmere existence of the extra matters of fact (that tell that the state is improperly\nmixed) to be sufficient for ontological robustness of the entanglement, then the whole\nthing becomes circular, since that existence is guaranteed by definition in all states\nthat are improperly separable. Other conditions are needed. Although Timpson\nand Brown do not explicitly give necessary or sufficient conditions for ontological\nrobustness, they do argue that using the extra facts of the matter an observer is\n\n\fThe quantum world and correlations\n\n213\n\nable to perform a place selection procedure that would allow the ensemble to be\nseparated out into the original statistically distinct sub-ensembles [i.e., into the\nentangled states]. We take it that the existence of such a selection procedure is thus\nposited as a sufficient condition for ontological robustness: \"all that is required is\naccess to these further facts\" [Timpson and Brown, 2005, sec. 1].\nWe agree on this point, but we believe that it is very well conceivable that according to quantum mechanics we do not in principle always have access to these\nextra facts. Perhaps the interactions between the object systems involved in the\npreparation procedure and the environment are such that the observer cannot become correlated to both the extra facts and the objects states in the right way for\nthe facts to be accessible, or, alternatively, the interactions could be such that no\nclassical record of the extra facts could possibly be left in the environment. To put\nit differently, although we agree that in the case of improper separability one can\nuphold an ignorance interpretation of the state in question and that furthermore\nthe ignorance is in principle about some extra facts of the matter, we do not agree\nthat it is certain that the ignorance about these extra facts of the matter can be\nremoved by the observer in accordance with the dynamics of quantum mechanics\nin all conceivable preparation procedures. This issue thus awaits a (dis)proof of\nprinciple10 .\nThe existence of a selection procedure is indeed a sufficient condition for ensuring\nthe ontological robustness of entanglement in improperly separable states. But since\nit is unclear whether one can indeed meet this condition it seems to be more fruitful\nto look for necessary conditions. We have proposed four different such conditions\nfor ontological robustness and argued that they can not be met.\n\n9.6\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Bell-type inequality violation of section 9.4 tells us that despite the fact that\na quantum state of a composite system is determined by the correlations between\neach of its possible subsystems, one cannot conclude that the quantum state can\nbe given a local realistic account in terms of the correlations it gives rise to. Just\nlike values of quantities correlations cannot be used to build up a world consisting\nout of some local realistic structure. We have that mathematically quantum correlations determine the quantum state, but ontologically they cannot be considered\nto be local realistic building blocks of the world. Of course, if one wants to build\nup another world where the building blocks need not be constrained by local realism (e.g., a world consisting of unrestricted primitive intrinsic correlations that do\n10 Timpson\n\n(private communication) has informed us that their argument is supposed to use the\nfollowing clause (not mentioned in their original paper): \"A separating place selection procedure\nis in principle possible: given access to the facts, the procedure could be performed.\" We do not\nquestion the latter. However, the issue at stake is if one can meet the conditional: it is by no\nmeans clear that quantum mechanics in principle allows one to have access to these facts and thus\nthat such a place selection procedure is in principle possible.\n\n\f214\n\nChapter 9\n\nnot supervene on intrinsic properties of the subsystems) then these results are not\nrelevant for this.\nA special type of quantum correlation is entanglement. Although entanglement\nis taken to be a resource in quantum information theory, we have argued that it\ncannot be considered ontologically robust because it is not an objective local realistic\nproperty and furthermore that without interaction it can be mixed away, swapped\nto another object, and flowed irretrievably into some environment.\nThe Bell-type inequality argument of section 9.4 was inspired by the work of\nCabello [1999] and Jordan [1999] who obtain almost exactly the same conclusion,\nalthough by different arguments. The argument of Cabello differs the most from\nours because he uses a different conception of what a quantum correlation is. His\nargument speaks of types of correlations which are associated with eigenvalues of\nproduct observables. We believe this notion to be less general than our notion of\nquantum correlation which only takes joint probability distributions to be correlations. Jordan's argument, in contrast, does in effect use the same notion of quantum\ncorrelation as we do. He considers mean values of products of observables and since\nthese are determined by mean values of (sums of) products of projection operators\nhe restricts himself to the latter. Jordan thus uses the same notion as we do because\nthe latter determine all joint probability distributions.\nHowever, Cabello and Jordan both need perfect correlations for their argument\nto work because the state dependent GHZ- or Hardy argument they use (Cabello\nuses both, Jordan only the latter argument) need such strong correlations. Our Belltype inequality argument does not rely on this specific type of correlation because\nnon-perfect statistical correlations already suffice to violate the Bell-type inequality\nhere presented. We therefore believe our argument has an advantage over the one\nused by Cabello and Jordan, because it is more amenable to experimental implementation.\nIn fact, the Bell-type inequality argument here presented can be readily implemented using current experimental technology. Indeed, it is already possible to\ncreate fully four-particle-entangled states [Sackett et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2003]\nand measurement of the four observables X, X \u2032 , Y , Y \u2032 of (9.8)-(9.11) seems not\nto be problematic since they are sums of ordinary projections. Furthermore, as\nsaid before, there is no need to produce perfect correlations; non-perfect statistical\nones will suffice. We therefore hope that in the near future experiments testing our\nargument will be carried out.\nLastly, returning to the questions stated in the introduction, in so far as Mermin\nin his [Mermin, 1998a, 1999, 1998b] is committed to take correlations (as we have\ndefined them here) to be interpreted local realistically (which we think he is), his\ntentative interpretation is at odds with predictions of quantum mechanics and would\nallow, in view of the argument given here, for an experimental verdict.\n\n\fChapter 10\n\n215\n\nDisentangling holism\nThis chapter is a slightly adapted version of Seevinck [2004].\n\n10.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHolism is often taken to be the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\nBecause of being too vague, this idea has only served as a guideline or intuition to\nvarious sharper formulations of holism. Here we shall be concerned with the one\nrelevant to physics, i.e., the doctrine of metaphysical holism, which is the idea that\nproperties or relations of a whole are not determined or cannot be determined by\nintrinsic properties or relations of the parts1 . This is taken to be opposed to a\nclaim of supervenience [Healey, 1991], to reductionism [Maudlin, 1998], to local\nphysicalism [Teller, 1986], and to particularism [Teller, 1989]. In all these cases a\ncommon approach is used to define what metaphysical holism is: via the notion\nof supervenience2 . According to this common approach metaphysical holism is the\ndoctrine that some facts, properties, or relations of the whole do not supervene on\nintrinsic properties and relations of the parts, the latter together making up the\n1 This metaphysical holism (also called property holism) is to be contrasted with explanatory\nholism and meaning holism [Healey, 1991]. The first is the idea that explanation of a certain\nbehavior of an object cannot be given by analyzing the component parts of that object. Think\nof consciousness of which some claim that it cannot be fully explained in terms of physical and\nchemical laws obeyed by the molecules of the brain. The second is the idea that the meaning of a\nterm cannot be given without regarding it within the full context of its possible functioning and\nusage in a language.\n2 The notion of supervenience, as used here, is meant to describe a particular relationship\nbetween properties of a whole and properties of the parts of that whole. The main intuition\nbehind what particular kind of relationship is meant, is captured by the following impossibility\nclaim. It is not possible that two things should be identical with respect to their subvenient or\nsubjacent properties (i.e., the lower-level properties), without also being identical with respect to\ntheir supervening or upper-level properties. The first are the properties of the parts, the second\nare those of the whole. The idea is that there can be no relevant difference in the whole without\na difference in the parts. (Cleland [1984] uses a different definition in terms of modal logic.)\n\n\f216\n\nChapter 10\n\nso-called supervenience basis. As applied to physical theories, quantum mechanics\nis then taken to be the paradigmatic example of a holistic theory, since certain\ncomposite states (i.e., entangled states) do not supervene on subsystem states, a\nfeature not found in classical physical theories.\nHowever, in this chapter we want to critically review the supervenience approach\nto holism and propose a new criterion for deciding whether or not a physical theory\nis holistic. The criterion for whether or not a theory is holistic proposed here is\nan epistemological one. It incorporates the idea that each physical theory (possibly\nsupplemented with a property assignment rule via an interpretation) has the crucial\nfeature that it tells us how to actually infer properties of systems and subsystems.\nThe guiding idea of the approach here suggested, is that some property of a\nwhole would be holistic if, according to the theory in question, there is no way we\ncan find out about it using only local means, i.e., by using only all possible nonholistic resources available to an agent. In this case, access to the parts would not\nsuffice for inferring the properties of the whole, not even via all possible subsystem\nproperty determinations that can be performed, and consequentially we would have\nsome instantiation of holism, called epistemological holism. The set of non-holistic\nresources is called the resource basis. We propose that this basis includes at least\nall local operations and classical communication of the kind the theory in question\nallows for.\nThe approach suggested here thus focuses on the inference of properties instead\nof on the supervenience of properties. It can be viewed as a shift from ontology\nto epistemology3 and also as a shift that takes into account the full potential of\nphysical theories by including what kind of property inferences or measurements\nare possible according to the theory in question. The claim we make is that these\ntwo approaches are crucially different and that each have their own merits. We show\nthe fruitfulness of the new approach by illustrating it in classical physics, Bohmian\nmechanics and orthodox quantum mechanics.\nThe structure of this chapter is as follows. First we will present in section 10.2\na short review of the supervenience approach to holism. We especially look at the\nsupervenience basis used. To illustrate this approach We consider what it has to\nsay about classical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we rigorously show that\nin this approach classical physics is non-holistic and furthermore that the orthodox\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics is deemed holistic. In the next section (section\n10.3) we will give a different approach based on an epistemological stance towards\nproperty determination within physical theories. This approach is contrasted with\nthe approach of the previous section and furthermore argued to be a very suitable\none for addressing holism in physical theories.\nIn order to show its fruitfulness we will apply the epistemological approach to\n3 This\n\ndifference is similar to the difference between the two alternative definitions of determinism. From an ontological point of view, determinism is the existence of a single possible future for\nevery possible present. Alternatively, from an epistemological point of view, it is the possibility in\nprinciple of inferring the future from the present.\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n217\n\ndifferent physical theories. Indeed, in section 10.4 classical physics and Bohmian\nmechanics are proven not to be epistemologically holistic, whereas the orthodox\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics is shown to be epistemologically holistic without making appeal to the feature of entanglement, a feature that was taken to be\nabsolutely necessary in the supervenience approach for any holism to arise in the\northodox interpretation of quantum mechanics. Finally in section 10.5 we will recapitulate, and argue this new approach to holism to be a fruit of the rise of the\nnew field of quantum information theory.\n\n10.2\n\nSupervenience approaches to holism\n\nThe idea that holism in physical theories is opposed to supervenience of properties\nof the whole on intrinsic properties or relations of the parts, is worked out in detail\nby Teller [1986] and by Healey [1991], although others have used this idea as well,\nsuch as French [1989]4, Maudlin [1998] and Esfeld [2001]. We will review the first\ntwo contributions in this section.\nBefore discussing the specific way in which part and whole are related, Healey\n[1991] clears the metaphysical ground of what it means for a system to be composed\nout of parts, so that the whole supervenience approach can get off the ground. We\ntake this to be unproblematic here and say that a whole is composed if it has\ncomponent parts. Using this notion of composition, holism is the claim that the\nwhole has features that cannot be reduced to features of its component parts. Both\nHealey [1991] and Teller [1986] use the same kind of notion for the reduction relation,\nnamely supervenience. However, whereas Teller only speaks about relations of the\nwhole and non-relational properties of the parts, Healey uses a broader view on\nwhat features of the whole should supervene on what features of the parts. Because\nof its generality we take essentially Healey's definition to be paradigmatic for the\nsupervenience approach to holism5 . In this approach, holism in physical theories\nmeans that there are physical properties or relations of the whole that are not\nsupervenient on the intrinsic physical properties and relations of the component\nparts. An essential feature of this approach is that the supervenience basis, i.e., the\nproperties or relations on which the whole may or may not supervene, are only the\nintrinsic ones, which are those which the parts have at the time in question in and\nout of themselves, regardless of any other individuals.\nWe see that there are three different aspects involved in this approach. The first\n4 French\n\n[1989] uses a slightly different approach to holism where supervenience is defined in\nterms of modal logic, following a proposal by Cleland [1984]. However, for the present purposes,\nthis approach leads essentially to the same results and we will not discuss it any further.\n5 The exact definition by Healey [1991, p.402] is as follows. \"Pure physical holism: There\nis some set of physical objects from a domain D subject only to processes of type P , not all of\nwhose qualitative, intrinsic physical properties and relations are supervenient upon the qualitative,\nintrinsic physical properties and relations of their basic physical parts (relative to D and P )\". The\ndefinition by Teller [1986] is a restriction of this definition to solely relations of the whole and\nintrinsic non-relational properties of the parts.\n\n\f218\n\nChapter 10\n\nhas to do with the metaphysical, or ontological effort of clarifying what it means\nthat a whole is composed out of parts. We took this to be unproblematic. The\nsecond aspect gives us the type of dependence the whole should have to the parts in\norder to be able to speak of holism. This was taken to be supervenience. Thirdly,\nand very importantly for the rest of this chapter, the supervenience basis needs to\nbe specified because the supervenience criterion is relativized to this basis. Healey\n[1991, p.401] takes this basis to be \"just the qualitative, intrinsic properties and\nrelations of the parts, i.e., the properties and relations that these bear in and out\nof themselves, without regard to any other objects, and irrespective of any further\nconsequences of their bearing these properties for the properties of any wholes\nthey might compose.\" Similarly Teller [1986, p.72] uses \"properties internal to a\nthing, properties which a thing has independently of the existence or state of other\nobjects.\"\nAlthough the choice of supervenience basis is open to debate because it is hard\nto specify precisely, the idea is that we should not add global properties or relations\nto this basis. It is supposed to contain only what we intuitively think to be nonholistic. However, as we aim to show in the next sections, an alternative basis exists\nto which a criterion for holism can be relativized. This alternative basis, the resource\nbasis as we call it, arises when one adopts a different view when considering physical\ntheories. For such theories not only present us an ontological picture of the world\n(although possibly only after an interpretation is provided), but also they present\nspecific forms of property assignment and property determination. The idea then is\nthat these latter processes, such as measurement or classical communication, have\nintuitively clear non-holistic features, which allow for an epistemological analysis of\nwhether or not a whole can be considered to be holistic or not.\nHowever, before presenting this new approach, we discuss how the supervenience\napproach treats classical physics and quantum mechanics (in the orthodox interpretation). In treating these two theories we will first present some general aspects\nrelated to the structure of properties these theories allow for, since they are also\nneeded in future sections.\n\n10.2.1\n\nClassical physics in the supervenience approach\n\nClassical physics assigns two kinds of properties to a system. State independent or\nfixed properties that remain unchanged (such as mass and charge) and dynamical\nproperties associated with quantities called dynamical variables (such as position\nand momentum) [Healey, 1991]. It is the latter we are concerned with in order\nto address holism in a theory since these are subject to the dynamical laws of\nthe theory. Thus in order to ask whether or not classical physics is holistic we\nneed to specify how parts and wholes get assigned the dynamical properties in the\ntheory6 . This ontological issue is unproblematic in classical physics, for it views\n6 This presentation of the structure of properties in classical physics was inspired by Isham\n[1995] although he gave no account of how the properties of a composite classical system are\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n219\n\nobjects as bearers of determinate properties (both fixed and dynamical ones). The\nepistemological issue of how to gain knowledge of these properties is treated via the\nidea of measurement. A measurement is any physical operation by which the value\nof a physical quantity can be inferred. Measurement reveals this value because it\nis assumed that the system has the property that the quantity in question has that\nvalue at the time of measurement. In classical physics there is no fundamental\ndifference between measurement and any other physical process. Isham [1995, p.57]\nputs it as follows: \"Properties are intrinsically attached to the object as it exists\nin the world, and measurement is nothing more than a particular type of physical\ninteraction designed to display the value of a specific quantity.\" The bridge between\nontology and epistemology, i.e., between property assignment (for any properties to\nexist at all (in the theory)) and property inference (to gain knowledge about them),\nis an easy and unproblematic one called measurement.\nThe specific way the dynamical properties of an object are encoded in the formalism of classical physics is in a state space \u03a9 of physical states x of a system.\nThis is a phase space where at each time a unique state x can be assigned to the\nsystem. Systems or ensembles can be described by pure states which are single\npoints x in \u03a9 or by mixed states which are unique convex combinations of the pure\nstates. The set of dynamical properties determines the position of the system in the\nphase space \u03a9 and conversely the dynamical properties of the system can be directly\ndetermined from the coordinates of the point in phase space. Thus, a one-to-one\ncorrespondence exists between systems and their dynamical properties on the one\nhand, and the mathematical representation in terms of points in phase space on\nthe other. Furthermore, with observation of properties being unproblematic, the\nstate corresponds uniquely to the outcomes of the (ideal) measurements that can\nbe performed on the system. The specific property assignment rule for dynamical\nproperties that captures the above is the following.\nA physical quantity A is represented by a function A : \u03a9 \u2192 R such that A(x)\nis the value A possesses when the state is x. To the property that the value of A\nlies in the real-valued interval \u2206 there is associated a Borel-measurable subset\n\u03a9A\u2208\u2206 = A\u22121 {\u2206} = {x \u2208 \u03a9|A(x) \u2208 \u2206},\n\n(10.1)\n\nof states in \u03a9 for which the proposition that the system has this property is true.\nThus dynamical properties are associated with subsets of the space of states \u03a9, and\nwe have the one-to-one correspondence mentioned above between properties and\npoints in the state space now as follows: A(x) \u2208 \u2206 \u21d4 x \u2208 \u03a9A\u2208\u2206 . Furthermore, the\nlogical structure of the propositions about the dynamical properties of the system\nis identified with the Boolean \u03c3-algebra B of subsets of the space of states \u03a9. This\nencodes the normal logical way (i.e., Boolean logic) of dealing with propositions\nabout properties7 .\nrelated to the properties of its subsystems.\n7 The relation of conjunction of propositions corresponds to the set-theoretical intersection (of\n\n\f220\n\nChapter 10\n\nIn order to address holism we need to be able to speak about properties of\ncomposite systems in terms of properties of the subsystems. The first we will call\nglobal properties, the second local properties8 . It is a crucial and almost defining\nfeature of the state space of classical physics that the local dynamical properties\nsuffice for inferring all global dynamical properties. This is formalized as follows9 .\nConsider the simplest case of a composite system with two subsystems (labeled 1 and\n2). Let the tuple < \u03a912 , B12 > characterize the state space of the composite system\nand the Boolean \u03c3-algebra of subsets of that state space. The latter is isomorphic\nto the logic of propositions about the global properties. This tuple is determined by\nthe subsystems in the following way. Given the tuples < \u03a91 , B1 > and < \u03a92 , B2 >\nthat characterize the subsystem state spaces and property structures, \u03a912 is the\nCartesian product space of \u03a91 and \u03a92 , i.e.,\n\u03a912 = \u03a91 \u00d7 \u03a92 ,\n\n(10.2)\n\nB12 = A(B1 , B2 ),\n\n(10.3)\n\nand furthermore,\n\nwhere A(B1 , B2 ) is the smallest \u03c3-algebra generated by \u03c3-algebras that contain\nCartesian products as elements. This algebra is defined by the following three\nproperties [Halmos, 1988]: (i) if A1 \u2208 B1 , A2 \u2208 B2 then A1 \u00d7 A2 \u2208 A(B1 , B2 ), (ii) it\nis closed under countable conjunction, disjunction and taking differences, (iii) it is\nthe smallest one generated in this way. The \u03c3-algebra B12 thus contains by definition\nall sets that can be written as a countable conjunction of Cartesian product sets\nsuch as \u039b1 \u00d7 \u039b2 \u2282 \u03a912 (with \u039b1 \u2282 \u03a91 , \u039b2 \u2282 \u03a92 ), also called rectangles.\nThe above means that the Boolean \u03c3-algebra of the properties of the composite\nsystem is in fact the product algebra of the subsystem algebras. Thus propositions\nabout global properties (e.g., global quantity B having a certain value) can be\nwritten as disjunctions of propositions which are conjunctions of propositions about\nlocal properties alone (e.g., subsystem quantities A1 and A2 having certain values).\nIn other words, the truth value of all propositions about B can be determined from\nthe truth value of disjunctions of propositions about properties concerning A1 and\nA2 respectively. The first and the latter thus have the same extension.\nOn the phase space \u03a912 all this gives rise to the following structure. To the\nproperty that the value of B of a composite system lies in \u2206 there is associated a\nsubsets of the state space), that of entailment between propositions to the set-theoretical inclusion,\nthat of negation of a proposition to the set-theoretical complement and finally that of disjunction\nof propositions corresponds to the set-theoretical union. In classical physics the (countable) logic\nof propositions about properties is thus isomorphic to a Boolean \u03c3-algebra of subsets of the state\nspace.\n8 Note that 'local' has here nothing to do with the issue of locality or spatial separation. It is\ntaken to be opposed to global, i.e., restricted to a subsystem.\n9 We have not been able to find elsewhere a formal treatment of how the properties of a composite\nclassical system are related to the properties of its subsystems. Therefore we give such a formal\ntreatment here.\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n221\n\nBorel-measurable subset of \u03a912 , for which the proposition that the system has this\nproperty is true:\n{(x1 , x2 ) \u2208 \u03a912 | B(x1 , x2 ) \u2208 \u2206} \u2208 B12 ,\n\n(10.4)\n\nwhere (x1 , x2 ) are the pure states (i.e., points) in the phase space of the composite\nsystem and x1 and x2 are the subsystem states that each lie in the state space \u03a91 or\n\u03a92 of the respective subsystem. The important thing to note is that this subset lies\nin the product algebra B12 and therefore is determined by the subsystem algebras\nB1 and B2 via the relation in (10.3).\nFrom the above we conclude, and so is concluded in the supervenience approaches mentioned in the introduction of section 10.1, although on other nonformal grounds, that classical physics is not holistic. For the global properties\nsupervene on the local ones because the Boolean algebra structure of the global\nproperties is determined by the Boolean algebra structures of the local ones. Thus\nall quantities pertaining to the global properties defined on the composite phase\nspace such as B(x1 , x2 ) are supervening quantities.\nFor concreteness consider two examples of such supervening quantities B(x1 , x2 )\nof a composite system. The first is q =k q1 \u2212q2 k which gives us the global property\nof a system that specifies the distance between two subsystems. The second is\nF = \u2212\u2207V (k q1 \u2212 q2 k) which gives us the property of a system that indicates how\nstrong the force is between its subsystems arising from the potential V . This could\nm1 m2 G\nfor the Newtonian gravity force. Although\nfor example be the potential kq\n1 \u2212q2 k\nboth examples are highly non-local and could involve action at a distance, no holism\nis involved since the global properties supervene on the local ones. As Teller [1986,\np.76] puts it: \"Neither action at a distance nor distant spatial separation threaten\nto enter the picture to spoil the idea of the world working as a giant mechanism,\nunderstandable in terms of the individual parts.\"\nSome words about the issue of whether spatial relations are to be considered\nholistic, are in order here. Although the spatial relation of relative distance of the\nwhole indicates the way in which the parts are related with respect to position,\nwhereby it is not the case that each of the parts has a position independent of\nthe other one, it is here nevertheless not regarded a holistic property since it is\nsupervening on spatial position. We have seen that the distance q between two\nsystems is treated supervenient on the systems having positions q1 and q2 in the\nsense expressed by equation (10.4). However, the argumentation given here requires\nan absolutist account of space so that position can be regarded as an intrinsic\nproperty of a system. But one can deny this and adopt a relational account of\nspace and then spatial relations become monadic and positions become derivative,\nwhich has the consequence that one has to incorporate spatial relations in the\nsupervenience basis10 .\n10 A\n\nmore subtle example than the relative distance between two points would be the question\nwhether or not the relative angle between two directions at different points in space is a supervening\n\n\f222\n\nChapter 10\n\nOn an absolutist account of space the spatial relation of relative distance between\nthe parts of a whole is shown to be supervenient upon local properties, and it is thus\nnot to be included in the supervenience basis11 . A relationist account, however,\ndoes include the spatial relations in the supervenience basis. The reason is that\non this account they are to be regarded as intrinsically relational, and therefore\nnon-supervening on the subsystem properties. Cleland [1984] and French [1989]\nfor example argue spatial relations to be non-supervening relations. Furthermore,\nsome hold that all other intrinsic relations can be regarded to be supervenient upon\nthese. The intuition is that wholes seem to be built out of their parts if arranged in\nthe right spatial relations, and these spatial relations are taken to be in some sense\nmonadic and therefore not holistic12 .\nThus we see that issues depend on what view one has about the nature of space\n(or space-time). Here we will not argue for any position, but merely note that if\none takes an absolutist stance towards space so that bodies are considered to have\na particular position, then spatial relations can be considered to be supervening on\nthe positions of the relata in the manner indicated by the decomposition of (10.4).\nThis discussion about whether spatial relations are to be regarded as properties\nthat should be included in the supervenience basis clearly indicates that the supervenience criterion must be relativized to the supervenience basis. As we will see\nlater on this is analogous to the fact that the epistemological criterion proposed\nhere must be relativized to the resource basis.\nAs a final note in this section, we mention that because of the one-to-one correspondence in classical physics between physical quantities on the one hand and\nstates on the state space on the other hand, and because composite states are\nuniquely determined by subsystem states (as can be seen from (10.2)), it suffices to\nconsider the state space of a system to answer the question whether or not some\ntheory is holistic. The supervenience basis is thus determined by the state space\n(supplemented with the fixed properties). However, this is a special case and it\ncontrasts with the quantum mechanical case (as will be shown in the next subsection). The supervenience approach should take this into account. Nevertheless, the\nsupervenience approach mostly limits itself to the quantum mechanical state space\nin determining whether or not quantum mechanics is holistic. The epistemological\napproach to be developed here uses also other relevant features of the formalism,\nsuch as property determination, and focuses therefore primarily on the structure of\nthe assigned properties and not on that of the state space. This will be discussed\nproperty, i.e., whether or not the relative angle is to be considered holistic or not. This depends\non whether or not one can consider local orientations as properties that are to be included in the\nsupervenience basis.\n11 Teller [1987] for example takes spatial relations to be supervening on intrinsic physical properties since for him the latter include spatiotemporal properties.\n12 Healey [1991, p.409] phrases this as follows: \"Spatial relations are of special significance because they seem to yield the only clear example of qualitative, intrinsic relations required in the\nsupervenience basis in addition to the qualitative intrinsic properties of the relata. Other intrinsic\nrelations supervene on spatial relations.\"\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n223\n\nin the following sections.\n\n10.2.2\n\nQuantum physics in the supervenience approach\n\nIn this section we will first treat some general aspects of the quantum mechanical\nformalism before discussing how the supervenience approach deals with this theory.\nIn quantum mechanics, just as in classical physics, systems are assigned two\nkinds of properties. On the one hand, the fixed properties that we find in classical\nphysics supplemented with some new ones such as intrinsic spin. On the other hand,\ndynamical properties such as components of spin [Healey, 1991]. These dynamical\nproperties are, again just as in classical physics, determined in a certain way by\nvalues observables have when the system is in a particular state. However, the state\nspace and observables are represented quite differently from what we have already\nseen in classical physics. In general, a quantum state does not correspond uniquely\nto the outcomes of the measurements that can be performed on the system. Instead,\nthe system is assigned a specific Hilbert space H as its state space and the physical\nstate of the system is represented by a state vector | \u03c8i in the pure case and a\ndensity operator \u03c1 in the mixed case. Any physical quantity A is represented by an\nobservable or self-adjoint operator13 \u00c2. Furthermore, the spectrum of \u00c2 is the set\nof possible values the quantity A can have upon measurement.\nThe pure state | \u03c8i can be considered to assign a probability distribution pi =\n| h \u03c8| ii|2 to an orthonormal set of states { | ii }. In the case where one of the states\nis the vector | \u03c8i, it is completely concentrated onto this vector. The state | \u03c8i can\nthus be regarded as the analogon of a \u03b4-distribution on the classical phase space\n\u03a9, as used in statistical physics. However the radical difference is that the pure\nquantum states do not (in general) form an orthonormal set. This implies that the\npure state | \u03c8i will also assign a positive probability to a different state | \u03c6i if they\nare non-orthogonal and thus have overlap. This is contrary to the classical case,\nwhere the pure state \u03b4(q \u2212 q0 , p \u2212 p0 ) concentrated on (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 \u03a9 will always give\nrise to a probability distribution that assigns probability zero to every other pure\nstate, since pure states on \u03a9 cannot have overlap. Furthermore, the probability\nthat the value of an observable B\u0302 lies in the real interval X when the system is in\nthe quantum state \u03c1 is T r (\u03c1PB\u0302,X ) where PB\u0302,X is the projector associated to the\npair (B\u0302, X) by the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators. This probability is in\ngeneral not concentrated in {0, 1} even when \u03c1 is a pure state. Only in the special\ncase that the state is an eigenstate of the observable B\u0302 is it concentrated in {0, 1},\nand the system is assigned the corresponding eigenvalue with certainty. From this\nwe see that there is no one-to-one correspondence between values an observable can\nobtain and states of the quantum system.\nBecause of this failure of a one-to-one correspondence there are interpretations\n13 For clarity we denote the quantum mechanical operator that correspond to observable A by\n\u00c2 so as to distinguish it from the function A which is used in classical physics to denote the same\nobservable.\n\n\f224\n\nChapter 10\n\nof quantum mechanics that postulate different connections between the state of the\nsystem and the dynamical properties it possesses. Whereas in classical physics this\nwas taken to be unproblematic and natural, in quantum mechanics it turns out to\nbe problematic and non-trivial. But a connection must be given in order to ask\nabout any holism, since we have to be able to speak about possessed properties and\nthus an interpretation that gives us a property assignment rule is necessary. Here\nwe will consider the well-known orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics that\nuses the so called eigenstate-eigenvalue link for this connection: a physical system\nhas the property that quantity A has a particular value if and only if its state is\nan eigenstate of the operator \u00c2 corresponding to A. This value is the eigenvalue\nassociated with the particular eigenvector. Furthermore, in the orthodox interpretation measurements are taken to be ideal von Neumann measurements14 , whereby\nupon measurement the system is projected into an eigenstate of the observable being measured and the value found is the eigenvalue corresponding to that particular\neigenstate. The probability for this eigenvalue to occur is given by the well-known\nBorn rule h i| \u03c1 | ii, with | ii the eigenstate that is projected upon and \u03c1 the state of\nthe system before measurement. Systems thus have properties only if they are in\nan eigenstate of the corresponding observables, i.e., the system either already is or\nmust first be projected into such an eigenstate by the process of measurement. We\nthus see that the epistemological scheme of how we gain knowledge of properties,\ni.e., the measurement process described above, serves also as an ontological one\ndefining what properties of a system can be regarded to exist at a given time at all.\nLet us now go back to the supervenience approach to holism and ask what it says\nabout quantum mechanics in the orthodox interpretation stated above. According\nto all proponents of this approach mentioned in the Introduction quantum mechanics is holistic. The reason for this is supposed to be the feature of entanglement,\na feature absent in classical physics. In order to discuss the argument used, let us\nfirst recall some aspects of entanglement that were already treated in chapter 2.\nEntanglement is a property of composite quantum systems whereby the state of the\nsystem cannot be derived from any combination of the subsystem states. It is due\nto the tensor product structure of a composite Hilbert space and the linear superposition principle of quantum mechanics. In the simplest case of two subsystems,\nthe precise definition is that the composite state \u03c1 cannot be written as a convex\nP\nsum of products of single particle states, i.e., \u03c1 6= i pi \u03c11i \u2297 \u03c12i , with pi \u2208 [0, 1] and\nP\ni pi = 1. In the pure case, an entangled state is one that cannot be written as a\nproduct of single particle states. Examples include the so-called Bell states | \u03c8 \u2212 i\nand | \u03c6\u2212 i of a spin- 12 particle. These states can be written as\n1\n\u03c8 \u2212 = \u221a (| 01iz \u2212 | 10iz ),\n2\n\n1\n\u03c6\u2212 = \u221a (| 00iz \u2212 | 11iz ),\n2\n\nwith | 0iz and | 1iz eigenstates of the spin operator \u015cz =\n\n~\n2 \u03c3\u0302z ,\n\n(10.5)\n\ni.e., the spin up\n\n14 These ideal von Neumann measurements use a projector valued measure (PVM) which is a\nP\nset of projectors {P\u0302i } such that\nP\u0302i = 1.\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n225\n\nand down state in the z-direction respectively. These Bell states are eigenstates for\ntotal spin of the composite system given by the observable \u015c 2 = (\u015c1 + \u015c2 )2 with\neigenvalue 0 and 2~2 respectively.\nAccording to the orthodox interpretation, if the composite system is in one of\nthe states of (10.5), the system possesses one of two global properties for total\nspin which are completely different, namely eigenvalue 0 and eigenvalue 2~2 . The\nquestion now is whether or not this spin property is holistic, i.e., does it or does it\nnot supervene on subsystem properties? According to the supervenience approach\nit does not and the argument goes as follows. Since the individual subsystems have\nthe same reduced state, namely the completely mixed state 1/2, and because these\nare not eigenstates of any spin observable, no spin property at all can be assigned\nto them. So there is a difference in global properties to which no difference in the\nlocal properties of the subsystems corresponds. Therefore there is no supervenience\nand we have an instantiation of holism15 . It is the feature of entanglement in this\nexample that is held responsible for holism. Maudlin [1998] even defines holism in\nquantum mechanics in terms of entanglement and Esfeld [2001, p.205] puts it as\nfollows: \"The entanglement of two or more states is the basis for the discussion on\nholism in quantum physics.\" Also French [1989, p.11], although using a different\napproach to supervenience (see footnote 10.2), shares this view: \"Since the state\nfunction [...] is not a product of the separate state functions of the particles, one\ncannot [...] ascribe to each particle an individual state function. It is this, of course,\nwhich reveals the peculiar non-classical holism of quantum mechanics.\"\nWe would now like to make an observation of a crucial aspect of the reasoning\nthe supervenience approach uses to conclude that quantum mechanics endorses\nholism. In the above and also in other cases the issue is treated via the concept of\nentanglement of quantum states. This, however, is a notion primarily tied to the\nstructure of the state space of quantum mechanics, i.e., the Hilbert space, and not\nto the structure of the properties assigned in the interpretation in question. There\nis no one-to-one correspondence between states and assigned dynamical properties,\ncontrary to what we have already seen in the classical case. Thus questions in terms\nof states, such as 'is the state entangled?' and in terms of properties such as 'is\nthere non-supervenience?' are different in principle. And although there is some\nconnection via the property assignment rule using the eigenvalue-eigenstate link,\nwe claim them to be relevantly different. Holism is a thesis about the structure of\nproperties assigned to a whole and to its parts, not a thesis about the state space of\na theory. The supervenience approach should carefully ensure that it takes this into\naccount. However, the epistemological approach of the next section naturally takes\nthis into account since it focuses directly on property determination. It probes the\nstructure of the assigned properties and not just that of the state space.\n15 This\n\nis the exact argument Maudlin [1998] uses. Healey [1991] and Esfeld [2001] also use an\nentangled spin example whereas Teller [1986, 1989], French [1989] and Howard [1989] use different\nentangled states or some consequence of entanglement such as violation of the bi-partite local Bell\ninequalities that are to be obeyed by local correlations.\n\n\f226\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe reason that in the supervenience approach one immediately and solely looks\nat the structure of the state space is because in its supervenience basis only the\nproperties the subsystems have in and out of themselves at the time in question are\nregarded. This means that using the eigenstate-eigenvalue rule for the dynamical\nproperties one focuses on properties the system has in so far as the state of the\nsystem implies them. Only eigenstates give rise to properties, other states do not.\nA different approach, still in the orthodox interpretation, would be to focus on\nproperties the system can possess according to the possible property determinations\nquantum mechanics allows for. It is the structure of the properties that can be\npossibly assigned at all, which is then at the heart of our investigations. In this\nview one could say that the physical state of a system is regarded more generally, as\nalso Howard [1989] does, as a set of dispositions for the system to manifest certain\nproperties under certain (measurement) circumstances, whereby the eigenstates are\na special case assigning properties with certainty. This view is the one underlying\nthe epistemological approach which will be proposed and worked out next.\n\n10.3\n\nAn epistemological criterion for holism in\nphysical theories\n\nBefore presenting the new criterion for holism we would like to motivate it by going\nback to the spin- 21 example of the last section. Let us consider the example, which\naccording to the supervenience approach gives an instantiation of holism, from a\ndifferent point of view. Instead of solely considering state descriptions, let us look\nat what physical processes can actually be performed according to the theory in\nquestion in order to gain knowledge of the system. We call this an epistemological\nstance. We will show next that it then is possible to determine, using only nonholistic means (to be specified later on) whether or not one is dealing with the Bell\nstate | \u03c8 \u2212 i or | \u03c6\u2212 i of (10.5). How? First measure on each subsystem the spin in\nthe z-direction. Next, compare these results using classical communication. If the\nresults have the same parity, the composite system was in the state | \u03c6\u2212 i with global\nspin property 2~2 . And if the results do not have the same parity, the system was\nin the state | \u03c8 \u2212 i with global spin property 0.\nThus using local measurements and classical communication the different global\nproperties can be inferred after all. There is no indication of holism in this approach,\nwhich is different from what the supervenience approach told us in the previous\nsection. Although it remains true that the mixed reduced states of the individual\nsubsystems do not determine the composite state and neither a local observable\n(of which there is no eigenstate), enough information can be nevertheless gathered\nby local operations and classical communication to infer the global property. We\nsee that from an epistemological point of view we should not get stuck on the\nfact that the subsystems themselves have no spin property because they are not\nin an eigenstate of a spin observable. We can assign them a state, and thus can\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n227\n\nperform measurements and assign them some local properties, which in this case\ndo determine the global property in question.\nFrom this example we see that this approach to holism does not merely look\nat the state space of a theory, but focuses on the structure of properties assigned\nto a whole and to its parts, as argued before that it should do. Then how do we\nspot candidates for holism in this approach? Two elements are crucial. Firstly,\nthe theory must contain global properties that cannot be inferred from the local\nproperties assigned to the subsystems, while, secondly, we must take into account\nnon-holistic constraints on the determination of these properties. These constraints\nare that we only use the resource basis available to local agents (who each have\naccess to one of the subsystems). The guiding intuition is that using this resource\nbasis will provide us with only non-holistic features of the whole. From this we\nfinally get the following criterion for holism in a physical theory:\nA physical theory is holistic if and only if it is impossible in principle,\nfor a set of local agents each having access to a single subsystem only, to\ninfer the global properties of a system as assigned in the theory (which\ncan be inferred by global measurements), by using the resource basis\navailable to the agents.\nCrucial is the specification of the resource basis. The idea is that these are all\nnon-holistic resources for property determination available to an agent. However,\njust as in the case of the specification of the supervenience basis, this basis probably cannot be uniquely specified, i.e., the exact content of the basis is open to\ndebate. Here we propose that these resources include at least all local operations\nand classical communication (abbreviated as LOCC)16 . The motivation for this is\nthe intuition that local operations, i.e., anything we do on the separate subsystems,\nand classically communicating whatever we find out about it, will only provide us\nwith non-holistic properties of a composite system. However it could be possible to\ninclude other, although more debatable, non-holistic resources. A good example of\nsuch a debatable resource we have already seen: Namely, whether or not an agent\ncan consider the position of a subsystem as a property of the subsystem, so that he\ncan calculate relative distances when he knows the fixed positions of other subsystems. Another example is provided by the discussion of footnote 10 which suggests\nthe question whether or not an agent can use a shared Cartesian reference frame,\nor a channel that transmits objects with well-defined orientations, as a resource for\ndetermining the relative angle between directions at different points in space.\nWe believe that the determination of these and other spatial relations should\nbe nevertheless included in the resource basis, for we take these relations to be\n(spatially) non-local, yet not holistic. Furthermore, because we are dealing with\nepistemology in specifying the resource basis, we do not think that including them\nnecessarily implies ontological commitment as to which view one must endorse about\n16 Note again that 'local' has here nothing to do with the issue of locality or spatial separation,\nbut that it is taken to be opposed to global, i.e., restricted to a subsystem.\n\n\f228\n\nChapter 10\n\nspace or space-time. Therefore, when discussing different physical theories in the\nnext section, we will use as the content of the resource basis, firstly, the determination of spatial relations, and secondly LOCC (local operations and classical\ncommunication). The latter can usually be unproblematically formalized within\nphysical theories and do not depend on, for example, the ontological view one has\nabout spacetime. We thus propose to study the physical realizability of measuring\nor determining global properties while taking as a constraint that one uses LOCC\nsupplemented with the determination of spatial relations.\nLet us mention some aspects of this proposed approach before it is applied in\nthe next section. Firstly, it tries to formalize the question of holism in the context\nof what modern physical theories are, taking them to be (i) schemes to find out and\npredict what the results are of certain interventions, which can be possibly used for\ndetermination of assigned properties, and (ii), although not relevant here, possibly\ndescribing physical reality. Theories are no longer taken to necessarily present us\nwith an ontological picture of the world specified by the properties of all things\npossessed at a given time.\nSecondly, the approach treats the concept of property physically and not ontologically (or metaphysically). We mean by this that the concept is treated analogous\nto the way Einstein treated space and time (as that what is given by measuring rods\nand revolutions of clocks), namely as that which can be attributed to a system when\nmeasuring it, or as that which determines the outcomes of interventions.\nThirdly, by including classical communication, this approach considers the possibility of determining some intrinsic relations among the parts such as the parity of\na pair of bits, as was seen in the previous spin- 21 example. The parts are considered\nas parts, i.e., as constituting a whole with other parts and therefore being related to\neach other. But the idea is that they are nevertheless considered non-holistically by\nusing only the resource basis each agent has for determining properties and relations\nof the parts.\nFourthly, as mentioned before, the epistemological criterion for holism is relativized to the resource basis. Note that this is analogous to the supervenience\ncriterion which is relativized to the supervenience basis. We believe this relativizing to be unavoidable and even desirable because it, reflects the ambiguity and\ndebatable aspect inherent in any discussion about holism. Yet, in this way it is\nincorporated in a fair and clear way.\nLastly, note that the epistemological criterion is logically independent of the\nsupervenience criterion. Thus whether or not a theory is holistic in the supervenience approach is independent of whether or not it is holistic in the newly proposed\nepistemological approach. This is the case because not all intrinsic properties and\nrelations in the supervenience basis are necessarily accessible using the resource basis, and conversely, some that are accessible using the resource basis may not be\nincluded in the supervenience one17 .\n17 Of the latter case an example was given using the spin- 1 example, since the property that\n2\nspecifies whether the singlet state or the triplet state obtains is not supervening, but can be inferred\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n10.4\n\n229\n\nHolism in classical physics and quantum\nmechanics; revisited\n\nIn this section we will apply the epistemological criterion for holism to different\nphysical theories, where we use as the content of the resource basis the determination\nof spatial relations supplemented with LOCC.\n\n10.4.1\n\nClassical physics and Bohmian mechanics\n\nIn section 10.2.1 classical physics on a phase space was deemed non-holistic in the\nsupervenience approach because global properties in this theory were argued to be\nsupervening on subsystem properties. Using the epistemological criterion we again\nfind that classical physics is deemed non-holistic18 . The reason is that because of\nthe one-to-one relationship between properties and the state space and the fact that\na Cartesian product is used for combining subsystem state spaces, and because measurement in classical physics is unproblematic as a property determining process,\nthe resource basis determines all subsystem properties. We thus are able to infer\nthe Boolean \u03c3-algebra of the properties of the subsystems. Finally, given this the\nglobal properties can be inferred from the local ones (see section 10.2.1) because\nthe Boolean algebra structure of the global properties is determined by the Boolean\nalgebra structures of the local ones, as was given in (10.3). Hence no epistemological\nholism can be found.\nAnother interesting theory that also uses a state space with a Cartesian product\nto combine state spaces of subsystems is Bohmian mechanics (see e.g. [D\u00fcrr et\nal., 1996]). It is not a phase space but a configuration space. This theory has an\nontology of particles with well defined positions on trajectories19 . Here we discuss\nthe interpretation where this theory is supplemented with a property assignment\nrule just as in classical physics (i.e., all functions on the state space correspond\nto possible properties that can all be measured). Indeed, pure physical states of\na system are given by single points (q) of the position variables q that together\nmake up a configuration space. There is a one-to-one relationship between the set\nof properties a system has and the state on the configuration space it is in, as was\nshown in section 10.2.1. The dynamics is given by the possibly non-local quantum\npotential Uqm (q) determined by the quantum mechanical state | \u03c8i, supplemented\nwith the ordinary classical potential V (q), such that the force on a particle is given\nusing only LOCC. Of the first case an example will be given in the next section.\n18 Note that in both cases only systems with finite many subsystems are considered.\n19 Bohmian mechanics, which has as ontologically existing only particles with well defined positions on trajectories, should be distinguished (although this is perhaps not common practice)\nfrom the so-called the de Broglie-Bohm theory where besides particles also the wave function has\nontological existence as a guiding field. This contrasts with Bohmian mechanics since in this theory the wave function has only nomological existence. Whether or not de Broglie-Bohm theory\nis holistic because of the different role assigned to the wave function needs careful examination,\nwhich will here not be executed.\n\n\f230\n\nChapter 10\n\nby: F := dp\ndt = \u2212\u2207[V (q) + Uqm (q)]. This theory can be considered to be a real\nmechanics, i.e., a Hamilton-Jacobi theory, although with a specific extra interaction\nterm. This is the quantum potential in which the wave function appears that has\nonly nomological existence. (Although a Hamilton-Jacobi theory, it is not classical\nmechanics: the latter is a second order theory, whereas Bohmian mechanics is of\nfirst order, i.e., velocity is not independent of position).\nIn section 10.2.1 all theories on a state space with a Cartesian product to combine\nsubsystem state spaces and using a property assignment rule just as in classical\nphysics were deemed non-holistic by the supervenience approach and therefore we\ncan conclude that Bohmian mechanics is non-holistic in this approach. Perhaps not\nsurprising, but the epistemological approach also deems this theory non-holistic.\nThe reason why is the same as why classical physics as formulated on a phase space\nwas argued above to be not holistic in this approach.\nBecause Bohmian mechanics and quantum mechanics in the orthodox interpretation have the same empirical content, one might think that because the first is not\nholistic, neither is the latter. However, this is not the case, as will be shown next.\nThis illustrates the fact that an interpretation of a theory, in so far as a property\nassignment rule is to be given, is crucial for the question of holism. A formalism on\nits own is not enough.\n\n10.4.2\n\nQuantum operations and holism\n\nIn this section we will show that quantum mechanics in the orthodox interpretation\nis holistic using the epistemological criterion, without using the feature of entanglement. In order to do this we need to specify what the resource basis looks like\nin this theory. Thus we need to formalize what a local operation is and what is\nmeant by classical communication in the context of quantum mechanics. For the\nargument it is not necessary to deal with the determination of spatial relations and\nthese will thus not be considered.\nLet us first look at a general quantum process S that takes a state \u03c1 of a system\non a certain Hilbert space H1 to a different state \u03c3 on a possibly different Hilbert\nspace H2 , i.e.,\n\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c3 = S(\u03c1),\n\n\u03c1 \u2208 H1 , S(\u03c1) \u2208 H2 ,\n\n(10.6)\n\nwhere S : H1 \u2192 H2 is a completely positive trace-nonincreasing map. This is an\noperator S, positive and trace non-increasing, acting linearly on Hermitian matrices such that S \u2297 1 takes states to states. These maps are also called quantum\noperations20 . Any quantum process, such as for example unitary evolution or measurement, can be represented by such a quantum operation.\nWe are now in the position to specify the class of LOCC operations that two\nparties a and b can perform. It is the class of local operations plus two-way classical\n20 See Nielsen and Chuang [2000] for an introduction to the general formalism of quantum operations.\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n231\n\ncommunication. It consists of compositions of elementary operations of the following\ntwo forms\nS a \u2297 1,\n\n1 \u2297 Sb,\n\n(10.7)\n\nwith S a and S b arbitrary local quantum operations that can be performed by party\na and b respectively. The class contains the identity and is closed under composition\nand taking tensor products. As an example consider the case where party a performs\na measurement and communicates her result \u03b1 to party b, after which party b\nperforms his measurement. The state \u03c1 of the composite system held by party a\nand b will then be modified as follows:\nS ab (\u03c1) = (1 \u2297 S\u03b1a ) \u25e6 (S b \u2297 1)(\u03c1).\n\n(10.8)\n\nWe see that party b can condition his measurement on the outcome that party a\nobtained. This example can be extended to many such rounds in which party a\nand party b each perform certain local operations on their part of the system and\ncondition their choices on what is communicated to them.\nSuppose now that we have a physical quantity R of a bi-partite system with\na corresponding operator R\u0302 that has a set of nine eigenstates, | \u03c81 i to | \u03c89 i, with\neigenvalues 1 to 9. The property assignment we consider is the following: if the\nsystem is in an eigenstate | \u03c8i i then it has the property that quantity R has the fixed\nvalue i (this is the eigenstate-eigenvalue link). Suppose R\u0302 works on H = Ha \u2297 Hb\n(each three dimensions21 ) and has the following complete orthonormal set of nonentangled eigenstates:\n| \u03c81 i = | 1i \u2297 | 1i ,\n\n| \u03c82,3 i = | 0i \u2297 | 0 \u00b1 1i ,\n\n| \u03c84,5 i = | 2i \u2297 | 1 \u00b1 2i ,\n\n| \u03c86,7 i = | 1 \u00b1 2i \u2297 | 0i ,\n\n| \u03c88,9 i = | 0 \u00b1 1i \u2297 | 2i ,\n\n(10.9)\n\nwith | 0 + 1i = \u221a12 (| 0i + | 1i), etc.\nWe want to infer whether the composite system has the property that the value\nof the observable R is one of the numbers 1 to 9, using only LOCC operations\nperformed by two parties a and b, who each have one of the individual subsystems.\nBecause the eigenstate-eigenvalue link is the property assignment rule used here,\nthis amounts to determining which eigenstate party a and b have or project on\nduring the LOCC measurement. If party a and b project on eigenstate | \u03c8i i then a\nquantum operation\nSi : \u03c1 \u2192\n\nSi (\u03c1)\nTr[Si (\u03c1)]\n\n(10.10)\n\n21 We are thus considering two qutrits. This is the sole exception in this dissertation of not\nconsidering qubits.\n\n\f232\n\nChapter 10\n\nis associated to the measurement outcome i, with associated projection operators\nSi = | iia | iib h \u03c8i |. This is nothing but the well-known projection due to measurement (with additional renormalisation), but here written in the language of local\nquantum operations22 . The state | iia denotes the classical record of the outcome\nof the measurement that party a writes down, and similarly for | iib . These records\ncan be considered to be local properties of the subsystems held by party a and b.\nIt follows from the theory of quantum operations [Nielsen and Chuang, 2000] that\ndetermining the global property assignment given by R\u0302 amounts to implementing\nP\nthe quantum operation S(\u03c1) = i Si \u03c1Si\u2020 , with Si as in (10.10). Surprisingly, this\ncannot be done using LOCC, a result obtained by Bennett et al. [1999a]. For\nthe complete proof see the original article by Bennett et al. [1999a] or Walgate\nand Hardy [2002]23 , but a sketch of it goes as follows. If A or B perform von\nNeumann measurements in any of their operation and communication rounds then\nthe distinguishability of the states is spoiled. Spoiling occurs in any local basis. The\nensemble of states as seen by A or by B alone is therefore non-orthogonal, although\nthe composite states are in fact orthogonal.\nFrom this we see that a physical quantity, whose corresponding operator has only\nproduct eigenstates, gives a property assignment using the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink that is not measurable using LOCC. Furthermore, we see that the resource\nbasis sketched before does not suffice in determining the global property assignment\ngiven by R\u0302. Thus according to the epistemological criterion of the previous section\nquantum mechanics is holistic, although no entanglement is involved24 . Examples\nof epistemological holism that do involve entanglement can of course be given. For\nexample, distinguishing the four (entangled) Bell states given by | \u03c8 + i, | \u03c8 \u2212 i, | \u03c6+ i\nand | \u03c6\u2212 i (see (10.5)) cannot be done by LOCC. Thus entanglement is sufficient to\nprove epistemological holism. However, this is hardly surprising. What is surprising\nis the fact that it is not necessary, i.e., that here a proof of epistemological holism is\ngiven not involving entanglement. Furthermore because of the lack of entanglement\nin this example it would not suffice for a proof of holism in the supervenience\napproach. Of course, it may well be that the resource basis used in this example is\ntoo limited, but we do not see other resources that may sensibly be included in this\nbasis so as to render this example epistemologically non-holistic.\n22 Instead\n\nof writing the projection operators as Si = | \u03c8i i h \u03c8i |, we write Si = | iia | iib h \u03c8i | to\nshow explicitly that only local records are taken. Since the states | ii can be regarded eigenstates\nof some local observable, we can regard them to determine a local property using the property\nassignment rule in terms of the eigenvalue-eigenstate link of the orthodox interpretation.\n23 This result is a special case of the fact that some family of separable quantum operations\n(that all have a complete eigenbasis of separable states) cannot be implemented by LOCC and\nvon Neumann measurements. This is proven by Chen and Li [2003].\n24 Groisman et al. [2007] have recently performed a more extended investigation of the nonclassicality of separable (unentangled) quantum states. They show many surprising non-classical\naspects of sets of product states which includes amongst others the product basis (10.9).\n\n\fDisentangling holism\n\n10.5\n\n233\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe sketched an epistemological criterion for holism that determines, once the resource basis has been specified, whether or not a physical theory with a property\nassignment rule is holistic. It was argued to be a suitable one for addressing holism\nin physical theories, because it focuses on property determination as specified by\nthe physical theory in question (possibly equipped with a property assignment rule\nvia an interpretation). We distinguished this criterion from the well-known supervenience criterion for holism and showed them to be logically independent. Furthermore, it was shown that both the epistemological and the supervenience approaches\nrequire relativizing the criteria to respectively the resource basis and the supervenience basis. We argued that in general neither of these bases is determined by the\nstate space of a physical theory. In other words, holism is not a thesis about the\nstate space a theory uses, it is about the structure of properties and property assignments to a whole and its parts that a theory or an interpretation allows for. And in\ninvestigating what it allows for we need to try to formalize what we intuitively think\nof as holistic and non-holistic. Here, we hope to have given a satisfactory new epistemological formulation of this, that allows one to go out into the world of physics\nand apply the new criterion to the theories or interpretations one encounters.\nIn this chapter we have only treated some specific physical theories. It was\nshown that all theories on a state space using a Cartesian product to combine\nsubsystem state spaces, such as classical physics and Bohmian mechanics, are not\nholistic in both the supervenience and epistemological approach. The reason for\nthis is that the Boolean algebra structure of the global properties is determined\nby the Boolean algebra structures of the local ones. The orthodox interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, however, was found to instantiate holism. This holds in\nboth approaches, although on different grounds. For the supervenience approach\nit is the feature of entanglement that leads to holism, whereas using only LOCC\nresources, one can have epistemological holism in absence of any entanglement, i.e.,\nwhen there is no holism according to the supervenience approach.\nThere are of course many open problems left. What is it that we can single\nout to be the reason of the holism found? The use of a Hilbert space with its\nfeature of superposition? Perhaps, but not the kind of superposition that gives rise\nto entanglement, for we have argued that it is not entanglement that we should\nper se consider to be the paradigmatic example of holism. Should we blame the\nproperty assignment rule which the orthodox interpretation uses? We shall leave\nthis an open problem.\nThe entangled Bell states | \u03c8 \u2212 i and | \u03c6\u2212 i of section 10.2.2 could, despite their\nentanglement, be distinguished after all using only LOCC, whereas this was not\npossible in the set of nine (non-entangled) product states of (10.9). These two\nquantum mechanical examples show us that we can do both more and less than\nquantum states at first seem to tell us. This is an insight gained from the new field\nof quantum information theory. Its focus on what one can or cannot do do with\n\n\f234\n\nChapter 10\n\nquantum systems, although often from an engineering point of view, has produced\na new and powerful way of dealing with questions in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics that can lead to fundamental new insights or principles. We hope the\nnew criterion for holism in physical theories suggested in this chapter is an inspiring\nexample of this.\n\n\fV\n\nEpilogue\n\n\f\fChapter 11\n\n237\n\nSummary and outlook\nIn this dissertation I have tried to understand different aspects of different kinds of\ncorrelations that can exist between the outcomes of measurement on subsystems of\na larger system. Four different kinds of correlation have been investigated: local,\npartially-local, no-signaling and quantum mechanical. Novel characteristics of these\ncorrelations have been used to study how they are related and how they can be\ndiscerned. The main tool of this investigation has been the usage of Bell-type\ninequalities that give non-trivial bounds on the strength of the correlations. The\nstudy of quantum correlations has also prompted us to study the multi-partite\nqubit state space (i.e., for N spin- 21 particles) with respect to its entanglement\nand separability characteristics, and the differing strength of the correlations in\nseparable and entangled qubit states.\nThroughout this dissertation I have restricted myself to the case where only two\ndichotomous observables are measured on each subsystem. Comparing the different\ntypes of correlations for this case has provided us with many new results on the\nvarious strengths of the different types of correlation. Because of the generality of\nthe investigation \u2013 we have considered abstract general models, not some specific\nand particular ones \u2013 these results have strong repercussions for different sorts\nof physical theories. I have commented on some of these repercussions, thereby\nobtaining foundational and philosophical results. These will be summarized below.\nAlthough each chapter ended with a summary and discussion of its own, I will\nnevertheless summarize each chapter individually in this final chapter. The reasons\nfor doing so are twofold. Firstly, this allows a potential reader to get a good idea\nof what is obtained in this dissertation, and secondly, this allows me to provide the\nnecessary background that is needed for a sound presentation of a number of open\nquestions, conjectures and directions for future research that can be drawn from\nthis dissertation. These will be presented throughout the summary in this final\nchapter, and, for clarity, they will be denoted by the symbol \u2704.\n\n\f238\n\nChapter 11\n\nPart I\nAfter a historical and thematic introduction in chapter 1, chapter 2 introduced\nthe definitions of the different types of correlations, the notations used, as well as\nthe mathematical methods that have been employed in the rest of the dissertation.\nThe different types of correlation have been identified with a set of positive and normalized joint probabilities for different outcomes of some experiment, conditional on\nthe settings (observables) chosen, further restricted by (i) no-signaling, (ii) locality,\n(iii) partial locality and (iv) quantum mechanics respectively. We have called such\njoint probabilities surface probabilities so as to distinguish them from subsurface\nprobabilities that are further conditioned on some hidden variable. We have next\nemployed a powerful geometrical interpretation of correlations, first introduced by\nPitowsky [1986], where they are viewed as vectors in a certain real high dimensional\nspace. This has enabled us to associate to each type of correlation a convex body\nin a high-dimensional probability space. Such a body is describable by bounding\nplanes (halfplanes) called facets. These facets are identified by tight Bell-type inequalities. All no-signaling, partially-local and local correlations are contained in\nsome polytope that each has a finite number of vertices and bounding facets, but\nquantum correlations are constrained by an infinite set of bounding planes and is\nthus not a polytope. In later chapters we have studied some of the containment\nrelationships that exist between these different correlation bodies, and this has provided us with many new results on how the different types of correlation are related.\nChapter 2 also paid special attention to quantum mechanics: we have introduced\nand discussed the distinction between entanglement and separability of quantum\nstates. After this introductory chapter we have presented our investigation and\nresults in three parts, Part II, III and IV, which will be summarized below.\nPart II\nPart II focused exclusively on bi-partite systems. In chapter 3 it was investigated\nwhat assumptions suffice to derive the original CHSH inequality for the case of\ntwo parties and two dichotomous observables per party. We have reviewed the fact\nthat the doctrine of Local Realism together with the assumption of free variables\nallows only local correlations and therefore obeys this inequality. However, it has\nbeen shown that one can relax all major physical assumptions and still derive the\nCHSH inequality. Indeed, one can allow for explicit non-local setting and outcome\ndependence in the determination of the local outcomes of experiment as well as\ndependence of the hidden variables on the settings chosen (i.e., the observables are\nno longer free variables). Therefore a larger class class of hidden-variable models\nthan is commonly thought is ruled out by violations of the CHSH inequality.\nThis shows that the well-known conditions of Outcome Independence and Parameter Independence [Shimony, 1986], that taken together imply the well-known\nconditions of Factorisability, can both be violated in deriving the inequality, i.e.,\nthey are not necessary for this inequality to obtain, but only sufficient. Therefore,\n\n\fSummary and outlook\n\n239\n\nwe have no reason to expect either one of them to hold solely on the basis of the\nCHSH inequality. Of course, when confronted with experimental violations of the\nCHSH inequality one must still give up on at least one of the conditions of Outcome\nIndependence and Parameter Independence or that the settings are free variables.\nHowever, the crucial point is that giving up only one might not be sufficient. The\nCHSH inequality does not allow one to infer which of the conditions in fact holds.\nIndeed, the results of this chapter have shown that even satisfaction of the inequality is not sufficient for claiming that either one holds. It could be that all conditions\nare violated in such a situation.\n\u2704 An open question remains what forms of non-local setting and outcome dependence at the subsurface (hidden-variable) level would be both\nnecessary and sufficient for deriving the CHSH inequality.\n\u2704 How should we understand violations of the CHSH inequality? This\nis a difficult question to answer, since no set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions is known such that a hidden-variable model obeys this inequality. The list of options, available to us at present, to answer this\nquestion is mentioned on page 85. But this list is by no means definitive\nbecause no necessary and sufficient set of conditions has been found,\nand consequently we do not precisely know what a violation of the inequality amounts to. It is important to recognize this if we are to have a\nproper appreciation of the epistemological situation we are in when we\nattempt to glean metaphysical implications of the failure of the CHSH\ninequality.\nThe Shimony conditions that give Factorisability have been shown to be nonunique by proving that the conjunction of Maudlin's conditions suffice too. This\nhas been first claimed by Maudlin [1994], but since no proof has been offered in the\nliterature, we have provided one ourselves. The Maudlin conditions need additional\nnon-trivial assumptions, which are not needed by the Shimony ones, in order to be\nevaluated in quantum mechanics. The argument that one can equally well chose\neither set (Maudlin's or Shimony's) has therefore been argued to be false.\nThe non-local derivation of the CHSH inequality has been contrasted with the\nderivation of Leggett's inequality [Leggett, 2003] for Leggett-type models. The\ndiscussion of Leggett's model has shown an interesting relationship between different\nconditions at different hidden-variable levels. It has been shown that in this model\nparameter dependence at the deeper hidden-variable level does not show up as\nparameter dependence at the higher hidden-variable level (where one integrates\nover a deeper level hidden variable), but only as outcome dependence, i.e., as a\nviolation of Outcome Independence. Conversely, for more general hidden-variable\nmodels it has been shown that violations of Outcome Independence can be a sign\nof a violation of deterministic Parameter Independence at a deeper hidden-variable\nlevel. This analysis shows that which conditions are obeyed and which are not\n\n\f240\n\nChapter 11\n\ndepends on the level of consideration. A conclusive picture therefore depends on\nwhich hidden-variable level is considered to be fundamental.\n\u2704 We leave as an interesting avenue for future research the investigation\nof the relationships between different assumptions at different hiddenvariable levels in general hidden-variable models.\nWe have presented analogies between different inferences that can be made on the\nlevel of surface and subsurface probabilities. The most interesting such an analogy is\nbetween, on the one hand, the subsurface inference that the condition of Parameter\nIndependence and violation of Factorisability implies randomness at the hiddenvariable level, and, on the other hand, the surface inference that any deterministic\nno-signaling correlation must be local, as was recently proven by Masanes et al.\n[2006]. A corollary of this inference is that any deterministic hidden-variable theory\nthat obeys no-signaling and gives non-local correlations must show randomness\non the surface, i.e., the surface probabilities cannot be deterministic. Bohmian\nmechanics is a striking example of this.\n\u2704 This result asks for a further investigation of the relationship between inferences and implications that exist at the levels of surface and\nsubsurface probabilities.\nIn chapter 2 it was shown that the facets of the no-signaling polytope give non-trivial\n\u2032\nBell-type inequalities for the marginal expectation values (e.g., hAiB \u2264 hAiB , etc.),\nbut not for the product expectation values such as hABi. We have searched for nontrivial inequalities in terms of the latter too. These cannot be facets of the polytope,\nbut they have been shown to be useful nevertheless. We have first shown that an\nalleged no-signaling Bell-type inequality as proposed by Roy and Singh [1989] is\nin fact trivial. However, combining several such trivial inequalities has allowed us\nto derive a new set of non-trivial no-signaling inequalities in terms of bounds on a\nlinear sum of product and marginal expectation values. In doing so we have had to\ngo beyond the analysis used in deriving the CHSH inequality because this inequality\nis trivial for no-signaling correlations.\nChapter 4 and 5 considered the CHSH inequality in quantum mechanics for\nthe case of two qubits. This inequality not only allows for discriminating quantum\nmechanics from local hidden-variable models, it also allows for discriminating separable from entangled states, i.e., the inequality is also a separability inequality.\nChapter 4 has shown that significantly stronger bounds on the CHSH expression\nhold for separable states in the case of locally orthogonal observables. In the case\nof qubits such a choice amounts to choosing anti-commuting observables. This was\nfurther strengthened using quadratic inequalities not of the CHSH form. These\nnew separability inequalities provide sharper tools for entanglement detection. We\nhave shown that if they hold for all sets of locally orthogonal observables they are\nnecessary and sufficient for separability, so the violation of these separability inequalities is not only a sufficient but also a necessary criterion for entanglement.\n\n\fSummary and outlook\n\n241\n\nThey have been argued to improve upon other such criteria, and furthermore do not\nneed a shared reference between the measurement apparata for each qubit because\nthe orientation of the measurement basis has been shown to be irrelevant.\n\u2704 An open problem is whether a finite collection of orthogonal observables can be found for which the satisfaction of these inequalities\nprovides a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. For mixed\nstates we have not been able to resolve this, but for pure states a set of\nsix inequalities using only three sets of orthogonal observables has been\nshown to be already necessary and sufficient for separability.\nThese inequalities, however, have been shown not to be applicable to the original\npurpose of testing local hidden-variable theories. This has provided a more general example of the fact first discovered by Werner [1989], i.e., that some entangled\ntwo-qubit states do allow a local realistic reconstruction for all correlations in a\nstandard Bell experiment. We have exhibited a 'gap' between the correlations that\ncan be obtained by separable two-qubit quantum states and those obtainable by\nlocal hidden-variable models. In fact, as is shown in chapter 6, the gap between the\ncorrelations allowed for by local hidden-variable theories and those attainable by\nseparable qubit states increases exponentially with the number of particles. Therefore, local hidden-variable theories are able to give correlations for which quantum\nmechanics, in order to reproduce them in qubit states, needs recourse to entangled\nstates; and even more and more so when the number of particles increases.\n\u2704 This 'non-classicality' of separable qubit states raises interesting questions. What is the relationship in quantum mechanics between the independence notions derived from the principle of locality and from a\nstate being separable? Are they fundamentally different and not equally\nstrong requirements? Given the surprising results found here between\nseparability of qubit states and local hidden-variable structures, the\nquestion what the classical correlations of quantum mechanics are, seems\nto still not be fully answered and open for new investigations.\nIn chapter 5 we have relaxed the condition of anti-commutation (i.e., orthogonality) of the local observables and studied the bound on the CHSH inequality for\nthe full spectrum of non-commuting observables, i.e., ranging from commuting to\nanti-commuting observables. Analytic expressions for the tight bounds for both\nentangled and separable qubit states have been provided.\nThe results are complementary to the well-studied question what the maximum\nof the expectation value of the CHSH operator is when evaluated in a certain (entangled) state. Here the focus has not been on a certain given state, but instead\non the observables chosen. Independent of the specific state of the system we have\nasked what the maximum of the expectation value of the CHSH operator is when\nusing certain local observables. The answer found shows a diverging trade-off relation for the two classes of separable and non-separable two-qubit states. Apart from\n\n\f242\n\nChapter 11\n\nthe purely theoretical interest of these bounds, they have been shown to have experimental relevance, namely that it is not necessary that one has exact knowledge\nabout the observables one is implementing in the experimental procedure. Ordinary\nentanglement criteria do require such knowledge.\n\u2704 It would be interesting to look for similar bounds that quantify what\nhappens when the local observables range from commuting to anticommuting in the case of non-linear separability inequalities, as well\nas to extend this analysis to multi-qubit separability inequalities and\nentanglement criteria.\nPart III\nIn Part III we have extended our investigation from the bi-partite to the multipartite case. Chapter 6 has been devoted to the investigation of multi-partite\nquantum correlations and of quantum entanglement and separability. A classification of partial separability of multi-partite quantum states has been proposed that\nextends the one of D\u00fcr and Cirac [2000, 2001]. The latter classification consists of\na hierarchy of levels corresponding to the k-separable states for k = 1, . . . N , and\nwithin each level different classes are distinguished by specifying under which partitions of the system the state is k-separable or k-inseparable. We have argued that\nit is useful to extend this classification with one more class at each level k, since\nthe notion of k-separability with respect to a specific partition does not exhaust\nall partial separability properties. We have furthermore discussed the relationship\nof partial separability to multi-partite entanglement. This relation turned out to\nbe non-trivial and therefore the notions of a k-separable entangled state and a mpartite entangled state has been distinguished. The interrelations of these kinds of\nentanglement has turned out to be rather intricate.\nNext, we have discussed necessary conditions that distinguish all types of partial\nseparability in the full hierarchic separability classification. This has been done\nby generalizing the derivation of the two-qubit separability inequalities of chapter\n4 to the multi-qubit setting. Violations of these inequalities provide, for all N qubit states, strong criteria for the entire hierarchy of k-separable entanglement,\nranging from the levels k=1 (full or genuine N -particle entanglement) to k = N\n(full separability, no entanglement), as well as for the specific classes within each\nlevel.\n\u2704 Although we believe we have resolved a large part of the non-trivial\nentanglement and separability relations in multi-partite quantum systems, many open question remain unanswered. Firstly, we have left\ncompletely untouched the relationship between the different separability levels and classes to the large variety of entanglement measures.\nSecondly, it would be interesting to study how the different classes and\nlevels are related under different kinds of quantum operations, in particular the so-called reversible LOCC operations. Thirdly, another avenue\n\n\fSummary and outlook\n\n243\n\nfor future research is to find different stronger separability and entanglement criteria for partial separability and multi-partite entanglement\nthan we have obtained here. Lastly, it is worthwhile to investigate if the\nextension from qubits to qudits is possible.\nThe strength of these criteria has been demonstrated in two ways: Firstly, by showing that they imply several other general experimentally accessible entanglement\ncriteria. We therefore believe these state-independent entanglement criteria to be\nthe strongest experimentally accessible conditions for multi-qubit entanglement applicable to all multi-qubit states. Secondly, the conditions have been compared\nto other state-specific multi-qubit entanglement criteria both for their white noise\nrobustness and for the number of measurement settings required in their implementation. They performed well on both these issues.\nChapter 7 has studied multi-partite correlations by investigating whether they\ncan be shared to other parties. In case this is not possible the correlations exhibit\nmonogamy constraints. Here one focuses on subsets of the parties and whether\ntheir correlations can be extended to parties not in the original subsets. This\ncan be done either directly in terms of joint probability distributions or in terms\nof relations between Bell-type inequalities that hold for different, but overlapping\nsubsets of the parties involved. Questions of monogamy and shareability were first\nstudied for quantum entanglement and we have compared this to the question of\nmonogamy and shareability of correlations. It has been obtained that shareability\nof non-local (quantum) correlations implies shareability of entanglement (of mixed\nstates), but not vice versa.\nIt has been proven that unrestricted general correlations can be shared to any\nnumber of parties (called \u221e-shareable). In the case of no-signaling correlations it\nwas already known that such correlations can be \u221e-shareable iff the correlations\nare local. This has been shown to imply, firstly, that partially-local correlations are\nalso \u221e-shareable, since they are combinations of local and unrestricted correlations\nbetween subsets of the parties. Secondly, it implies that both quantum and nosignaling correlations that are non-local are not \u221e-shareable and we have reviewed\nexisting monogamy constraints for such correlations. We have given an independent\nsimpler proof of the monogamy relation of Toner and Verstraete [2006], and have\nprovided a different strengthening of this constraint than was already given by them.\nFor the case of two parties, the relationship between sharing non-local quantum\ncorrelations and sharing mixed entangled states has been investigated. The CollinsGisin Bell-type inequality, which has three dichotomous observables per party, has\nbeen found to indicate that non-local quantum correlations can be shared and thus\nto indicate sharing of mixed state entanglement. The CHSH inequality does not indicate this. This shows that non-local correlations in a setup with two dichotomous\nobservables per party cannot be shared, whereas this is possible in a setup with one\nobservable per party more.\nFor no-signaling correlations the monogamy constraint of Toner [2006] has been\n\n\f244\n\nChapter 11\n\ninterpreted as a non-trivial bound on product expectation values attainable by\nthree-partite no-signaling correlations. We know of no other such discerning inequalities in terms of solely product expectation values for three or more parties.\nLastly, monogamy constraints of three-qubit bi-separable quantum correlations\nhave been derived, which is a first example of investigating monogamy of quantum\ncorrelations using a three-partite Bell-type inequality.\n\u2704 An avenue for new research is investigating the shareability and\nmonogamy aspects of multi-partite quantum and no-signaling correlations. For N > 3 this field is largely unexplored.\n\u2704 Another new direction for research is to further explore the relationships between shareability (monogamy) of entanglement and shareability (monogamy) of non-local quantum correlations.\nChapter 8 has been devoted to the task of discerning the different kinds of\nmulti-partite correlations. New Bell-type inequalities have been constructed that\ndiscern partially-local from quantum mechanical and more general correlations.\nAlso, the issue of discerning multi-partite no-signaling correlations has been discussed. For the three-partite case Svetlichny [1987] derived a non-trivial Bell-type\ninequality for partially-local correlations. This inequality can thus distinguish between full three-partite non-locality and two-partite non-locality in a three-partite\nsystem. We have shown that Svetlichny's inequalities generalize to the multi-partite\ncase.\nQuantum mechanics has been shown to violate these inequalities for some fully\nentangled multi-qubit states and these can thus be considered to be fully nonlocal. In a recent four-particle experiment such a violation was observed, so full\nnon-locality occurs in nature. However, any bi-separable state (i.e., which is not\nfully entangled) has correlations that are strictly weaker than those obtainable by\npartially-local hidden-variable models. Thus a 'gap' has been shown to appear\nbetween the correlations obtainable from bi-separable quantum states and those\nfrom partially-local hidden-variable models. It thus takes fully entangled states to\nretrieve all correlations obtainable by such a model. This is analogous to the results\nof chapter 4 and 6, where it was shown that one needs entangled states to give all\nthe correlations that are producible by local hidden-variable models.\n\u2704 It is an open question whether all fully entangled states imply full\nnon-locality. If they do, this cannot always be shown by violations of\nthe multi-partite Svetlichny inequalities, for we have shown that fully\nentangled mixed states exist that do not violate any of them.\n\u2704 It is unknown if the Svetlichny inequalities give facets of the partiallylocal polytope. It would be interesting to obtain the full set of tight\nSvetlichny inequalities for N parties, although this might be a computationally hard problem.\n\n\fSummary and outlook\n\n245\n\n\u2704 We have also observed that although the Svetlichny inequalities discern partially-local and quantum correlations from the most general\ncorrelations, they cannot do so for no-signaling correlations. Providing discriminating conditions for multi-partite no-signaling correlations\n(N > 3) in terms of product expectation values (possibly including some\nmarginal expectation values) is left as an open problem.\nPart IV\nPart IV dealt with some philosophical aspects of quantum correlations. Chapter\n9 has as a starting point the fact the global state of a composite quantum system\ncan be completely determined by specifying correlations between outcomes of measurements performed on subsystems only. Although quantum correlations suffice to\nreconstruct the quantum state this does not justify the idea that they are objective\nlocal properties of the composite system in question. Using a Bell-type inequality\nargument it has been shown that they cannot be given a local realistic explanation.\nSuch a latter view has been defended by Mermin [1998a,b, 1999], although he has\nby now set this idea aside.\nAs a corollary to this result we have argued that entanglement cannot be considered to be ontologically robust. Four conditions have been presented that were\nargued to be necessary conditions for ontological robustness of entanglement and it\nhas been shown that they are all four violated by entangled states.\n\u2704 A problem left open is the ontological status of entanglement. Does\nentanglement require some separate metaphysical treatment? This is a\nparticular instance of the bigger question what the ontological status of\nthe quantum state itself is. This problem reappears in the next chapter\n(see below).\nIn chapter 10 we have considered two related questions that frequently come\nup when discussing entanglement in quantum mechanics, namely whether it forces\nthis theory to be holistic, and whether the correlations entangled quantum states\ngive rise to are holistic. In order to address these questions we have considered\nthe idea of holism and have given two ways one might think of it in physics. The\nfirst is well-known and uses the supervenience approach to holism developed by\nTeller [1986, 1989] and Healey [1991], the second has been proposed here and it\nuses an epistemological criterion to determine whether a theory is holistic, namely:\na physical theory is holistic if and only if it is impossible in principle to infer some\nglobal properties (as assigned by the theory) by local resources available to an\nagent. We have proposed that these resources include at least all local operations\nand classical communication (LOCC).\nThis approach has been contrasted with the supervenience approach, the latter having a greater emphasis on ontology. Furthermore, it has been shown that\n\n\f246\n\nChapter 11\n\nboth the epistemological and the supervenience approaches require relativizing the\ncriteria to respectively the resource basis and the supervenience basis. We have\nconcluded that in general neither of these bases is determined by the state space of\na physical theory. We have therefore argued that holism is not a thesis about the\nstate space of a theory, but that it is a thesis about the structure of properties and\nproperty assignments to a whole and its parts that a theory or an interpretation\nallows for.\nIn this chapter only some specific physical theories have been treated. All theories on a state space using a Cartesian product to combine subsystem state spaces,\nsuch as classical physics and Bohmian mechanics, have been shown not to be holistic\nin both the supervenience and epistemological approach. The orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics, however, has been found to instantiate holism. This\nholds in both approaches, although on different grounds. For the supervenience\napproach it is the feature of entanglement that leads to holism, whereas using our\nepistemological criterion for holism we have shown holism without using any entanglement.\n\u2704 What is the non-classical part of quantum mechanics? This question\nhas been asked before in chapter 4 and 6, but it reappears here. We have\nargued that entanglement is not required for the non-classical feature of\nholism to arise. Furthermore, what justification do we have for thinking\nthat a possible answer to this question can be read off from the quantum\nmechanical state space? In assessing the metaphysical implications of\nquantum theory we propose that one should not focus solely on the state\nspace but rather at the structure of properties and property assignments\nto a whole and its parts that this theory or an interpretation of it allows\nfor. But to fully take this view home more work needs to be done.\n\n\fBibliography\nAc\u0131\u0301n, A., Bruss, D., Lewenstein, M., & Sanpera, A. (2001). Classification of mixed threequbit states, Phys.

Allereerst de studie naar\nmogelijke correlaties tussen meetuitkomsten uitgevoerd aan deelsystemen van een\nsamengesteld systeem zoals deze door een specifieke fysische theorie worden voorspeld. Ten tweede, de studie naar wat deze theorie voorspelt voor de verschillende\nrelaties die de deelsystemen kunnen hebben met het samengestelde systeem waarvan ze een deel uitmaken. En ten derde, de vergelijking van verschillende fysische\ntheorie\u00ebn met betrekking tot deze twee aspecten. De bestudeerde fysische theorie\u00ebn\nzijn niet-relativistische quantummechanica en gegeneraliseerde waarschijnlijkheidstheorie\u00ebn in een quasi-klassiek raamwerk.\nDe motivatie achter dit onderzoek is dat de wijze waarop een fysische theorie\nde relatie tussen delen en gehelen beschrijft, bij uitstek aangeeft wat deze theorie over de wereld beweert. Op deze wijze wordt, onafhankelijk van specifieke\nmodellen, de essenti\u00eble fysische vooronderstellingen en structurele aspecten van de\nbestudeerde theorie blootgelegd. Dit vergroot enerzijds het inzicht in de verschillende bestudeerde fysische theorie\u00ebn, en anderzijds in wat zij over de wereld beweren.\nVier verschillende soorten correlaties zijn bestudeerd in dit proefschrift: lokale,\npartieel-lokale, niet-seinen en quantummechanische correlaties. De onderlinge vergelijking van de verschillende correlaties heeft nieuwe resultaten opgeleverd over de\nrelatieve sterkten van de verschillende correlaties, alsmede hoe deze van elkaar te\nonderscheiden. Met name de structuur van quantummechanische toestanden bleek\nverrassend complex te zijn.\nDe algemeenheid van het onderzoek \u2013 er werd gekeken naar abstracte algemene\nmodellen \u2013 heeft het mogelijk gemaakt sterke conclusies af te leiden voor de verschillende fysische theorie\u00ebn als geheel. Deze conclusies zijn van grondslagen en\nfilosofisch gewicht, met name met betrekking tot de haalbaarheid van verborgenvariabelen-theorie\u00ebn voor de quantummechanica, de klassiek-quantum dichotomie\nen de vraag naar holisme in fysische theorie\u00ebn.\n\nDeel I introduceert dit proefschrift. Na een historische en thematische inleiding\nin hoofdstuk 1, wordt in hoofdstuk 2 de definities van de verschillende typen\ncorrelatie gegeven, alsmede de gebruikte notatie en wiskundige methoden.\nDeel II behandelt uitsluitend samengestelde systemen bestaande uit twee deelsystemen. In hoofdstuk 3 wordt onderzocht welke aannames volstaan om de zogenoemde Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) ongelijkheid [Clauser et al., 1969]\naf te leiden voor het geval van twee deeltjes en twee dichotome observabelen per\ndeeltje.\n\n\f262\n\nAllereerst wordt in herinnering gebracht dat een lokale verborgen-variabelentheorie die uitgaat van zogenoemde 'vrije variabelen' noodzakelijkerwijs slechts\nlokale correlaties kan voortbrengen en derhalve in alle gevallen aan de CHSH ongelijkheid moet voldoen. Vervolgens wordt, ondanks dat deze ongelijkheid \u00e9\u00e9n van de\nbekendste en meest bestudeerde Bell-ongelijkheden is, aangetoond dat ons begrip\nervan verre van volledig is en dat een nader onderzoek van deze ongelijkheid aanleiding geeft tot interessante, onverwachte beschouwingen.\nZo blijkt dat alle fysische aannames die men gewoonlijk maakt om de CHSH\nongelijkheid af te leiden, kunnen worden afgezwakt. Onder deze zwakkere aannames, die onder andere verschillende vormen van niet-lokaliteit toestaan, geldt de\nCHSH ongelijkheid nog steeds. Bijgevolg geeft een schending van deze ongelijkheid\naan dat een grotere klasse van verborgen-variabelen-theorie\u00ebn uitgesloten is dan\nmen gewoonlijk aanneemt.\nDit alles heeft sterke repercussies voor de interpretatie van schendingen van de\nCHSH ongelijkheid. Het is tot op heden onduidelijk wat een dergelijke schending\nprecies inhoudt omdat er nog geen geheel van noodzakelijke en voldoende aannames\nis gevonden waaronder deze ongelijkheid moet gelden. Enkel voldoende aannames\nzijn bekend. Er wordt betoogd dat dit gegeven erkend moet worden willen we een\njuiste waardering verkrijgen van de kentheoretische situatie waarin we ons bevinden\nwanneer we proberen metafysische implicaties af te leiden uit de schending van de\nCHSH ongelijkheid.\nDit hoofdstuk onderzoekt tevens de onderlinge relaties van verschillende aannames die leiden tot een bepaalde vorm van 'factorisatie', ook wel 'lokale causaliteit'\nof 'Bell-lokaliteit' genoemd. Naast een vergelijk van de welbekende aannames\nopgesteld door Jarrett [1984] en Shimony [1986] wordt er stil gestaan bij de aannames gemaakt door Maudlin [1994]. Van deze laatste wordt een bewijs gegeven\ndat zij daadwerkelijk de gewenste factorisatie geven \u2013 een bewijs dat in de literatuur niet te vinden was. De toepassing in de quantummechanica van Maudlin's\naannames vereist echter bijkomende niet-triviale aannames. Toepassing van de Shimony's aannames behoeft daarentegen geen supplementaire aannames. Dit haalt\nde stelling onderuit dat men net zo goed de \u00e9\u00e9n als de ander kan kiezen.\nEen analyse van de zogenoemde Leggett-ongelijkheid [Leggett, 2003] heeft ons\neen geheel nieuw gezichtspunt opgeleverd: dat van de vraag naar een mogelijk\ndieper liggend niveau van verborgen-variabelen. Het blijkt dat de geldigheid, dan\nwel ongeldigheid, van verschillende aannames omtrent verborgen-variabelen afhangt\nvan welk niveau men beschouwt. Een definitief oordeel hangt dus af van welk\nverborgen-variabelen-niveau als fundamenteel mag worden beschouwd.\nDit hoofdstuk verdiept zich tot slot in de eis van 'niet-seinen' (de eis dat lokale\nempirisch toegankelijke waarschijnlijkheden geen afhankelijkheid vertonen van veraf\ngelegen, niet-lokale vrijheidsgraden). Met deze eis in het achterhoofd worden verschillende analogi\u00ebn opgespoord tussen gevolgtrekkingen die gelden op verschillende\nverborgen-variabelen-niveaus. Een interessant uitvloeisel hiervan is de conclusie dat\nelke deterministische verborgen-variabelen-theorie, die voldoet aan de eis van niet-\n\n\fSamenvatting\n\n263\n\nseinen en die niet-lokale voorspellingen wil doen, aan de empirische oppervlakte\nindeterministisch moet zijn. Anders gezegd, een deterministische theorie waarmee\nniet geseind kan worden, moet in haar empirisch toetsbare voorspellingen noodgedwongen probabilistisch van aard zijn. De Bohmse mechanica is een treffend voorbeeld hiervan. Niet-seinen correlaties kunnen echter niet onderscheiden worden\nvan meer algemene correlaties door gebruik te maken van de CHSH ongelijkheid.\nNieuwe ongelijkheden worden afgeleid die dit wel mogelijk maken, en deze hebben\neen verrassende gelijkenis met de aloude CHSH ongelijkheid.\nHoofdstuk 4 en 5 behandelen de CHSH ongelijkheid in de quantummechanica\nvoor het geval van twee quantum bits, ook wel 'qubits' geheten (dit zijn quantummechanische systemen met als toestandsruimte een twee-dimensionale Hilbertruimte\nC2 ; bijvoorbeeld spin-1/2 deeltjes). Deze ongelijkheid is niet alleen geschikt om\nquantummechanische correlaties van lokale correlaties te onderscheiden, maar ook\nseparabele van niet-separabele (verstrengelde) quantummechanische toestanden.\nHoofdstuk 4 laat zien dat voor separabele toestanden er een aanzienlijk sterkere\ngrens op de CHSH uitdrukking moet gelden wanneer er onderling loodrechte observabelen gemeten worden (gerepresenteerd door anti-commuterende operatoren).\nDit resultaat wordt vervolgens versterkt met behulp van kwadratische ongelijkheden\ndie niet van de CHSH-vorm zijn. Deze nieuwe separabiliteitsongelijkheden geven\nscherpere criteria voor de detectie van verstrengeling dan andere bestaande criteria.\nDe separabiliteitsongelijkheden zijn echter niet geschikt om het oorspronkelijke\ndoel van Bell-ongelijkheden te realiseren. Met andere woorden, zij kunnen geen\nlokaal verborgen-variabelen-theorie\u00ebn toetsen. Dit verschijnsel is een meer algemeen voorbeeld van het feit, allereerst ontdekt door Werner [1989], dat sommige\nverstrengelde twee-qubit toestanden een lokaal verborgen-variabelen-model toestaan. Een 'gat' is blootgelegd tussen correlaties verkregen middels separabele tweequbit toestanden en middels lokaal verborgen-variabelen-modellen. In hoofdstuk 6\nwordt aangetoond dat het gat exponentieel toeneemt met het aantal qubits. Derhalve is het zo dat lokaal verborgen-variabelen-theori\u00ebn in staat zijn correlaties te\ngeven waarvoor de quantummechanica, wil het deze correlaties reproduceren middels qubits, een beroep moet doen op verstrengelde toestanden; en bij een stijgend\naantal deeltjes zal dit beroep groter en groter moeten zijn. De resultaten laten zien\ndat de vraag wat nu precies klassieke- en quantummechanische correlaties zijn, nog\nsteeds niet definitief beantwoord is en dus nog nader onderzoek vergt.\nIn hoofdstuk 5 wordt de eis van lokale orthogonaliteit (anti-commutativiteit)\nvan de te meten observabelen (operatoren) afgezwakt. De grens op de CHSH uitdrukking wordt bepaald voor het gehele spectrum van niet-commuterende operatoren; van commuterend tot anti-commuterend. Deze grens wordt voor zowel verstrengelde als separabele toestanden analytisch bepaald. Het gevonden resultaat\nlaat een divergerende 'trade-off' relatie zien voor de twee klassen van separabele en\nverstrengelde toestanden. Afgezien van de puur theoretische relevantie, heeft deze\nrelatie een sterk experimenteel voordeel. Ze geeft een algemeen geldend en sterk\ncriterium voor verstrengeling waarbij het niet noodzakelijk is dat precies bekend is\n\n\f264\n\nwelke observabelen er gemeten worden.\nIn deel III is het onderzoek uitgebreid naar systemen met meer dan twee deelsystemen, zeg N in totaal. Zulke systemen zullen we 'meer-deeltjes systemen' noemen, of ook wel 'N -deeltjes systemen'. Hoofdstuk 6 is gewijd aan zowel het\nonderzoeken van quantummechanische correlaties in meer-deeltjes systemen, als\naan het bestuderen van meer-deeltjes verstrengeling en separabiliteit. We beperken\nons weer tot qubits. Dit hoofdstuk laat zien dat de classificatie van parti\u00eble separabiliteit van quantummechanische toestanden zoals gegeven door D\u00fcr and Cirac\n[2000, 2001] op een belangrijk punt moet worden uitgebreid. Deze uitbreiding heeft\ngevolgen voor ons begrip van de relatie tussen parti\u00eble-separabiliteit enerzijds en\nmeer-deeltjes verstrengeling anderzijds. Deze relatie blijkt uiterst niet-triviaal te\nzijn en derhalve moeten we de noties van een k-separabel-verstrengelde toestand en\neen m-deeltjes-verstrengelde toestand introduceren en onderscheiden.\nOm meer grip op de verschillende klassen van quantummechanische toestanden\nte verkrijgen besteedt dit hoofdstuk veel aandacht aan het verkrijgen van noodzakelijke condities die deze klassen van elkaar kunnen onderscheiden. Daartoe wordt\nde analyse van hoofdstuk 4 gegeneraliseerd van twee naar een willekeurig aantal\ndeeltjes. Schendingen van deze condities geven experimenteel toegankelijke criteria voor de gehele hi\u00ebrarchie van k-separabele verstrengeling, van k = 1 (volledige\nverstrengeling) tot k = N (volledige separabiliteit, geen verstrengeling). De sterkte\nvan deze criteria wordt tweevoudig aangetoond. Ten eerste impliceren en versterken\nze verscheidene andere criteria voor verstrengeling. Ten tweede hebben de criteria\nexperimenteel gunstige eigenschappen. Ze bezitten een sterke robuustheid voor verschillende vormen van ruis en het noodzakelijk aantal te meten observabelen, vereist\nbij experimentele implementatie, is beperkt.\nHoofdstuk 7 onderzoekt de correlaties in meer-deeltjes systemen op geheel andere wijze. Er wordt onderzocht of deze correlaties kunnen worden gedeeld met\nandere deeltjes. Dit duiden we aan met de term 'deelbaarheid'. (Een correlatie\ntussen twee systemen is deelbaar dan en slechts dan als een derde systeem dezelfde\ncorrelatie met \u00e9\u00e9n van de twee oorspronkelijke systemen kan aannemen, zonder\ndat de oorspronkelijke correlatie tussen de eerste twee systemen verloren gaat.)\nIndien deelbaarheid niet mogelijk is spreekt men van 'monogamie' of 'beperkte\npromiscu\u0131\u0308teit' van correlaties. De onderzoeksmethode is in dit geval als volgt: men\nbestudeert deelverzamelingen van deeltjes en onderzoekt of hun correlaties kunnen\nworden gedeeld met deeltjes die niet in de oorspronkelijke deelverzameling zitten.\nMonogamie van verstrengeling alsmede haar deelbaarheid zijn al eerder onderzocht\nen hier worden enkele resultaten van dat onderzoek vergeleken met behaalde resultaten betreffende monogamie en deelbaarheid van correlaties. Er blijkt onder\nandere dat wanneer niet-lokale correlaties kunnen worden gedeeld, dit impliceert\ndat verstrengeling kan worden gedeeld. Het omgekeerde is echter niet het geval.\nTevens wordt aangetoond dat algemene, niet nader ingeperkte correlaties te delen zijn met een willekeurig aantal andere deeltjes (dit noemen we '\u221e-deelbaarheid').\nEerder was ontdekt dat niet-seinen correlaties \u221e-deelbaar zijn dan en slechts dan\n\n\fSamenvatting\n\n265\n\nals de correlaties lokaal zijn. Hieruit volgt dat zowel quantummechanische als nietseinen correlaties die niet-lokaal zijn, niet \u221e-deelbaar zijn. Deze correlaties vertonen dus beperkte promiscu\u0131\u0308teit. Naast bovenstaande bevat dit hoofdstuk vele\nidee\u00ebn die nog slechts marginaal verkend zijn, maar ook nog enkele harde resultaten.\nNoemenswaardig is het eenvoudiger bewijs voor, en de versterking van, een zeer interessante monogamie-relatie van Toner and Verstraete [2006]. Daarnaast wordt\neen eerste voorbeeld gegeven van een onderzoek naar monogamie-eigenschappen\nvan drie-deeltjes correlaties middels een drie-deeltjes Bell-ongelijkheid.\nHoofdstuk 8 is gewijd aan de taak hoe verschillende meer-deeltjes correlaties\nvan elkaar te onderscheiden. Bell-ongelijkheden worden gegeven die partieel-lokale\ncorrelaties van quantummechanische en van meer algemene correlaties onderscheiden. De drie-deeltjes ongelijkheid zoals voor het eerst gegeven door Svetlichny\n[1987] wordt gegeneraliseerd naar een willekeurig aantal deeltjes. Deze ongelijkheid\nonderscheidt volledig niet-lokale van partieel-lokale correlaties. De quantummechanica schendt deze ongelijkheid voor sommige volledig verstrengelde toestanden. De\ncorrelaties in deze toestanden zijn dus volledig niet-lokaal.\nDeel IV gaat over filosofische aspecten van quantummechanische correlaties.\nHoofdstuk 9 heeft als startpunt het feit dat de globale quantum toestand van een\nsamengesteld systeem volledig kan worden gespecificeerd door te refereren naar correlaties tussen uitkomsten van metingen aan uitsluitend deelsystemen. Alhoewel\nquantummechanische correlaties dus volstaan om de toestand te reconstrueren,\nwordt er betoogd dat deze correlaties niet opgevat kunnen worden als objectieve\nlokale eigenschappen van de deelsystemen in kwestie. Met behulp van een argument dat gebruik maakt van een Bell-ongelijkheid wordt er aangetoond dat zij geen\nlokaal-realistische verklaring kunnen verkrijgen. Dit resultaat wordt ten slotte gebruikt om de vraag naar de ontologische status van verstrengeling te stellen. De\nbeantwoording van deze vraag geeft aan dat verstrengeling vier (weliswaar aanvechtbare) noodzakelijke condities voor ontologische robuustheid blijkt te schenden. We\nmoeten concluderen dat de ontologische status van verstrengeling verre van duidelijk\nis.\nHoofdstuk 10 behandelt een veelgestelde vraag omtrent de aard van quantummechanische verstrengeling: in hoeverre maakt verstrengeling de quantummechanica holistisch? Of anders gezegd, in hoeverre zijn de correlaties verkregen middels\nverstrengelde toestanden holistisch ('holistisch' als zou het geheel meer dan de som\nder delen zijn)? Om deze vragen zinnig te behandelen worden twee verschillende\nopvattingen over holisme in fysische theorie\u00ebn behandeld. De eerste manier staat\nbekend als de superveni\u00ebntie-benadering en is uitgewerkt door Teller [1986, 1989] en\nHealey [1991], de tweede manier wordt hier voor het eerst uiteengezet en gebruikt\neen epistemologisch criterium om te bepalen of een theorie holistisch is. Beide\nmanieren worden met elkaar gecontrasteerd en er wordt beargumenteerd \u2013 contra\ncommunis opinio \u2013 dat holisme niet een these over de toestandsruimte van een theorie is, maar over de structuur van de eigenschapstoekenning aan een geheel en zijn\ndelen zoals de theorie (of interpretatie) dat voorschrijft.\n\n\f266\n\nToepassing van de analyse op verschillende fysische theorie\u00ebn heeft de volgende\nconclusies opgeleverd. Elke theorie die een Cartesisch product gebruikt om toestandsruimten van deelsystemen te combineren ten einde de toestandsruimte van\nhet totale systeem te verkrijgen, is nimmer holistisch. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de\nklassieke en Bohmse mechanica. De quantummechanica is echter holistisch. Dit\nis zo in beide benaderingen, maar vanwege verschillende oorzaken. Voor de superveni\u00ebntie-benadering is het de aanwezigheid van verstrengeling die maakt dat\nde quantummechanica holistisch is, maar bij gebruik van het epistemologisch criterium is de quantummechanica als holistisch aan te duiden zonder enig gebruik\nvan verstrengeling. Een onverwacht resultaat.\nDeel V beslaat slechts \u00e9\u00e9n afsluitend hoofdstuk. Hoofdstuk 11 bevat een\nconclusie en discussie van de behaalde resultaten, alsmede een vooruitblik waarin\nopen vragen en voorstellen voor toekomstig onderzoek worden gegeven.\n\n\fPublications\nArticles this dissertation is largely based on:\n\n\u0088 Uffink, J., & Seevinck, M.P.
