Interestingly, it also involves beautiful mathematics, and leads to a rich interplay\nbetween the physical and mathematical points of view. To quote a traditional example, the construction of four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric\nheterotic string vacua [1] involves the study of stable G-bundles on CalabiYau threefolds, with G a subgroup of E8 \u00d7 E8 or SO(32) (for recent results\non this approach, see [2]).\nRecent developments in string theory have led to new kinds of string\ntheory vacua with potential phenomenological interest. A particular class\n[4] corresponds to compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefold X with gauge\nbundles defined on subvarieties of the internal space (times non-compact\nspacetime). In physical terms, the compactification includes a set of D-branes\n[3], which are dynamical extended objects partially wrapped on the internal\nmanifold, and filling non-compact spacetime. Their dynamics is controlled by\na gauge theory defined on their world-volume. The rank of the gauge bundle\nthey carry is usually referred to as the number of D-branes. In the following\nwe center on the simplest case of D3-branes in type IIB string theory, where\neach D-brane spans four-dimensional spacetime times a point P \u2208 X. The\nproperties of the corresponding gauge theory sector in the low-energy theory\nare then determined in terms of the local geometry of X around P .\nFor a set of D3-branes sitting at a smooth point in X, the low-energy\ngauge field theory on the world-volume has N = 4 supersymmetry, and is\ntherefore non-chiral and phenomenologically uninteresting. Chiral gauge sectors arise when D3-branes sit at singular points in X. Singularities preserving\nat least N = 1 supersymmetry, and at a finite distance in Calabi-Yau moduli\nspace must be Gorenstein canonical singularities.\nIn Section 2 we discuss several systems of branes at singular points in\nnon-compact Calabi-Yau spaces. In section 2.1 we center on the simple case\nof threefold quotient singularities, which leads to an implementation of the\nMcKay correspondence in string theory. In section 2.2. and 2.3 we point out\nseveral generalizations suggested by string theory. In section 3 we discuss\nhow an extremely simple Z3 quotient singularity leads to gauge groups and\nparticle contents remarkably similar to those of the (minimal supersymmetric) standard model.\n2\n\n\fI am grateful to G.

Gonz\u00e1lez for encouragement and support.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nBranes at singularities\nBranes at orbifold singularities\n\nLet \u0393 be a discrete group of SU(3), and {ri } the set of its unitary irreducible\nrepresentations. We want to consider a set of D3-branes at the origin of\nC3 /\u0393, where \u0393 acts on C3 through a three-dimensional representation R3 .\nConsider first a set of N D3-branes at the origin in C3 , labeled by an index\na = 1, . . . , N referred to as Chan-Paton index. Quantization of open strings\nwith endpoints of the D3-branes leads to a set of dynamical fields propagating\non the D3-brane world-volume. In terms of N = 1 supersymmetry multiplets,\nthe corresponding gauge field theory contains a set of vector multiplets (each\ncontaining one gauge field and one complex fermion) with gauge group U(N),\nand three chiral multiplets \u03a6a , a = 1, 2, 3 (each containing one complex scalar\nand one complex fermion). The latter transform in the adjoint representation\nof U(N) and form a triplet under the SU(3) action on C3 . The interactions\nare encoded in the superpotential function W = \u01ebabc tr (\u03a6a \u03a6b \u03a6c ), where \u01ebabc\ncorrespond to the components of the SU(3) invariant tensor.\nFollowing [5] (see [6, 7] for generalizations, and [8, 9, 10, 11] for related\ndiscussions) the field theory on D3-branes at the origin in C3 /\u0393 is obtained\nfrom the above field theory associated to N D3-branes in flat space, by\nkeeping the states which are invariant under the combined action of \u0393 on C3\n(as determined by R3 ) and on the space of Chan-Paton indices (through a NL\ndimensional representation R, with decomposition R = i Ni ri ). Following\n[9], we regard fields in the adjoint of U(N) as Hom(CN , CN ). The projection\non the N = 1 vector multiplets leaves the following fields\nHom(CN , CN )\u0393 =\n\nM\n\nHom(CNi , CNi )\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nQ\n\ncorresponding to a gauge group i U(Ni ). The projection on the SU(3)\ntriplet of N = 1 chiral supermultiplets leaves the following fields\n(R3 \u2297 Hom(CN , CN ))\u0393 =\n\nM\ni,j\n\n3\n\na3ij Hom(CNi , CNj )\n\n(2)\n\n\fL\n\nwhere a3ij are defined by R3 \u2297ri = j a3ij rj . Hence we obtain a3ij N = 1 chiral\nmultiplets transforming in the representation (Ni , N j ) of the gauge group.\nThe superpotential is obtained by restricting the above one to the surviving\nfields.\nThe field content on the D3-brane world-volume can be encoded in a\nquiver diagram, where the ith node represents the U(Ni ) factor in the gauge\ngroup, and a3ij oriented arrows from the ith to the j th node correspond to\nthe N = 1 chiral multiplets in the (Ni , N j ) representation. Finally, closed\ntriangles of oriented arrows are associated to superpotential couplings of\nthe corresponding chiral multiplets. The quiver for a C3 /Z5 singularity is\ndepicted in Fig. 2a.\nSeveral interesting mathematical connections arise at this point. For instance, the quiver diagrams encoding the field theory content and interactions\ncoincide with the McKay quivers associated to the singularity, and which are\nrelated to the homology of the resolved space by the McKay correspondence\n[12]. The correspondence arises in the string theory context since branes\ngiving rise to a specific gauge factor have the geometrical interpretation of\nhigher-dimensional branes wrapped on homology cycles of the space (see [13]\nfor a detailed description). Hence, gauge theory data (the quiver diagram)\nare related to the homology of the ambient space.\nAlso, if R is chosen to be the regular representation of \u0393, the moduli\nspace of vacua of the gauge theory corresponds to the space of possible locations of the D3-brane, which is isomorphic to the transverse space C3 /\u0393.\nThe construction of the moduli space amounts to performing a symplectic\nquotient in the subspace of fields subject to relations \u2202W\n= 0 (F-term con\u2202\u03a6i\nstraints) determined by the superpotential [7]. It provides the string theory\ncounterpart of the construction of C3 /\u0393 as the moduli of representations of a\nquiver diagram with relations [14]. In the particular case \u03b3 \u2282 SU(2), studied\nin [5, 6], one recovers the hyperk\u00e4hler quotient construction of ALE spaces\n[15]. String theory also provides a description of the resolved spaces, by a\nsuitable modification of the symplectic quotient due to a non-zero moment\nmap (D-term).\nWe conclude this section with some physical considerations. In string theory D-branes are sources of certain p-form gauge fields from the closed string\nsector, whose equations of motion may impose certain consistency conditions\non the D-brane configuration. In the particular case of D3-branes at C3 /\u0393\nsingularities, the equations of motion for fields located at the singularity im-\n\n4\n\n\fpose the so-called twisted tadpole cancellation conditions, which for quotient\nsingularities amount to the vanishing of the character of the representation\nR. This constraint is equivalent to the cancellation of non-abelian anomalies\nin the gauge field theory on the D3-branes world-volume [16]. They also\nimply that the remaining mixed U(1)- non-abelian anomalies have a factorized form and are cancelled by a version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism\n[17]. The anomalous U(1) factors become massive and disappear from the\nlow-energy dynamics.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nGeneralizations\nNon-orbifold singularities\n\nThere is no simple recipe to obtain the field theory on the world-volume of\nstacks of D3-branes at a general singularity. However, the requirement that\nits moduli space should correspond to the space of possible locations of Dbranes in the transverse space is enough to determine the field theory in the\nsimple example of the conifold singularity Xcon [18], defined by the hypersurface x2 +y 2 +z 2 +w 2 = 0 in C4 . A set of N D3-branes at a conifold singularity\nyields a N = 1 supersymmetric field theory with gauge group U(N) \u00d7 U(N)\nand chiral multiplets Ai , Bi , i = 1, 2 in the representations (N, N) and (N, N)\nunder the gauge group, and in the representations (2, 1)1/2 , (1, 2)1/2 under\nthe SU(2)2 \u00d7 U(1) symmetry group of Xcon . The interactions are determined\nby a quartic superpotential W = \u01ebij \u01ebkl tr Ai Bj Ak Bl .\nThis example provides a whole new family of models [19] (see [20, 21] for\na related discussion) corresponding to D3-branes at quotients of the conifold,\nXcon /\u0393, with \u0393 a subgroup of SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) in order to preserve N = 1\nsupersymmetry. The strategy is, as in section 2.1, to start with D3-branes at\nXcon , embed the action of \u0393 on the Chan-Paton indices, and keep only fields\nwhich are invariant under the combined geometrical and Chan-Paton action\nof \u0393. The resulting field theories can be encoded in a quiver diagram, with\nnodes and arrows corresponding to gauge factors and chiral multiplets, and\nsuperpotential terms correspond to closed polygons formed by four arrows.\nWhen \u0393 acts on the Chan-Paton indices in the regular representation, the\nmoduli space of the gauge theory is a symplectic quotient subject to F-term\nconstraints from the superpotential, as obtained in explicit examples [22, 23],\ngeneralizing the orbifold result.

Each blow-up is reflected\non the quiver as the joining of two nodes (the joint node is denoted by a hat), and\nthe disappearance of certain arrows (depicted with thin heads).\n\nA general recipe to obtain the field theory on D3-branes at a general toric\nsingularities X was proposed in [24] (see [25] for a more general discussion).\nIt is based on realizing X as a partial resolution of a threefold quotient singularity C3 /\u0393 for suitable \u0393 \u2282 SU(3). The construction requires a precise\nidentification of the effect of the resolution on the field theory, which is a specific Higgs mechanism in which several gauge factors break to their diagonal\nsubgroup, and some chiral multiplets become massive and disappear from\nthe light spectrum. The detailed map has been worked out in some explicit\nexamples, e.g. in [24, 26], and provides an explanation for the existence of\nquiver diagrams for non-orbifold singularities. They are obtained by joining\nnodes and deleting arrows in the quiver of the initial quotient singularity, as\ndictated by the Higgs mechanism in the field theory. The quiver version of\nthe resolution of the C3 /(Z2 \u00d7Z2 ) singularity to the conifold is shown in Figure 1 [24]. It would be interesting to obtain a more precise characterization\nof these operations on quiver diagrams.\nAnother interesting question is related to the uniqueness of the field theory corresponding to a given singularity [25]. In some cases, different field\ntheories may have isomorphic moduli spaces. Mathematically, the representation moduli of the corresponding quivers with relations are isomorphic.\n6\n\n\fU(n0)\n0\n1\n000\n111\n0\n1\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\nU(n )\n111\n000\n0000\nU(n1) 1\n000 1\n111\n01111\n0 4\n0000\n1111\n1111111\n0000000\n000\n111\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000\n111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000\n111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n111\n000\n0000000\n1111111\n1111\n0000\n0000000\n1111111\n000\n111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000\n111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n000\n111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0001\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0 111\n1\n0\n0000000\n1111111\n0\n1\n0U(n )\n1\nU(n2)\n3\n\nb)\n\na)\n\nU(n1)\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\nSO(n0)\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n0\n1\n1\nU(n2) 0\n\nFigure 2: Figure a) shows the quiver diagram for the C3 /Z5 singularity, with Z5\n1\n\n1\n\naction (z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2192 (e2\u03c0i 5 z1 , e2\u03c0i 5 z2 , e2\u03c0i 5 z3 ). Figure b) shows the quiver of the\nsingularity after an orientifold projection.\n\u22122\n\nFrom the physical point of view, the equality of moduli spaces may in some\ncases [19, 22] be a reflection of Seiberg duality, a non-trivial infrared equivalence of seemingly different field theories.\n2.2.2\n\nOrientifold projections\n\nType IIB string theory is invariant under an operation \u03a9 which reverses the\norientation on the world-sheet. Hence it is possible to consider modding out\ntype IIB configurations by \u03a9, possibly accompanied by a geometric involution\ng, also leaving the theory invariant [27, 28]. The new configurations thus\nobtained are called orientifolds, and are characterized by the inclusion of\nnon-orientable world-sheets in the string theory perturbative expansion.\nWe are interested in studying D3-branes at orientifold threefold singularities, i.e. \u03a9g quotients of the system of D3-branes at singularities in CY\nthreefolds. The best studied case is again that of quotient singularities C3 /\u0393,\nand for the sake of clarity here we center on \u0393 = ZN with the action of the\ngenerator \u03b8 of ZN on C3 represented by \u03b3 = diag(e2\u03c0it1 /N , e2\u03c0it2 /N , e2\u03c0it3 /N ),\nP\nwith ti integers defined modulo N, and 3a=1 ta = 0 mod N. Let us embed\nthe action of \u03b8 on the Chan-Paton indices by a diagonal matrix \u03b3\u03b8,3 with Nk\nentries e2\u03c0i k/N . The field theory one obtains has vector multiplets with gauge\nQ\na\ngroup N\ni=1 U(Ni ), and chiral multiplets \u03a6i,i+ta , a = 1, . . . , 3, i = 1, . . . , N in\nthe representation (Ni , N i+ta ).\nThe orientifold action may also be embedded in the space of Chan-Paton\nindices, through a matrix \u03b3\u03a9g,3 . The representations of \u0393 and \u03a9g are usually\n7\n\n\fconstrained from mutual consistency requirements [27, 28]. Several solutions\nto these conditions are known (quite exhaustively in the two-fold case [29]),\nbut a complete classification is lacking. In the following we center on a concrete example [17] where g inverts all coordinates in C3 , and exchanges closed\nstring fields in oppositely twisted sectors, i.e. has a non-trivial action on the\nhomology cycles shrunk at the singularity. We also choose \u03b3\u03a9g,3 symmetric\nand such that exchanges the eigenspaces of conjugate eigenvalues in \u03b3\u03b8,3 . The\naction of ZN on Chan-Paton indices is therefore constrained to form a real\nrepresentation, Nk = N\u2212k .\nThe effect of the orientifold projection on the spectrum is as follows.\nGauge factors associated to conjugate irreducible representations of ZN are\nidentified, and unitary gauge factors associated to real representations are\nreduced to their maximal orthogonal subgroups. Correspondingly, the chiral\nmultiplets \u03a6ai,i+ta and \u03a6a\u2212i\u2212ta ,\u2212i are identified. When i + ta = \u2212i the bifundamental field is projected down to a two-index antisymmetric representation\nof the unitary gauge factor after the projection. The quiver diagram for an\norientifold of a C3 /Z5 singularity is depicted in Figure 2b.\nThe effect on the quiver diagram of C3 /\u0393 is an identification of nodes and\narrows related by a Z2 action, with a specific prescription for nodes and arrows which are mapped to themselves (it would be interesting to characterize\nthese mappings more precisely in order to allow the classification of resulting models). One may wonder about the meaning of the resulting quiver.\nString theory suggests it encodes the information about the homology of the\nresolved orientifold singularity. In fact, the string theory counting of homology cycles in the resolved space (by counting of twisted sector blow-up\nmoduli) gives roughly speaking half the number encountered before the orientifold projection, due to the non-trivial action of g by exchanging oppositely\ntwisted sectors. This agrees with the counting of nodes in the orientifolded\nquiver, which also gives half the number encountered before the orientifold\nprojection.\nWe conclude by pointing out that orientifolds of non-orbifold singularities\ncan be constructed as partial resolutions of orientifold of quotient singularities. Preliminary results on some simple examples [30] indicate that the effect\nof the orientifold projection on the quiver of the non-orbifold singularity is\nalso a Z2 involution, and that the orientifold singularity can be constructed\nas a symplectic quotient on the space of fields constrained by the F-terms\nconditions.\n\n8\n\n\f3\n\nParticle physics\n\nIn this section we discuss particular examples of singularities leading to interesting low-energy field theories, in that they resemble the structure of the\n(minimal supersymmetric) standard model (or some extension thereof) which\nwe now review. Such models would provide phenomenologically interesting\nstring theory vacua when embedded in a compact Calabi-Yau context.\n\n3.1\n\nReview of the (minimal supersymmetric) standard\nmodel\n\nAll known non-gravitational interactions between elementary particles are\ndescribed by the quantum field theory known as standard model. The simplest supersymmetric extension of this model contains vector multiplets with\ngauge group SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). It also contains a set of chiral multiplets\ntransforming in three copies of the representation\n(3, 2)1/6 + (3, 1)\u22122/3 + (3, 1)1/3 + (1, 2)1/2 + (1, 1)1,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere subscripts denote U(1) charges. Successful breaking of the electroweak\ninteractions requires also at least one chiral multiplet in the representation\n(1, 2)1/2 + (1, 2)\u22121/2 .\nInteractions are encoded in a set of complicated gauge invariant functions\nof these chiral multiplets, the superpotential and gauge kinetic functions,\nwhich are holomorphic, and the K\u00e4hler potential, which is real. We will\nskip their details since realistic phenomenology usually involves additional\nmodel-dependent assumptions, like additional global symmetries.\n\n3.2\n\nRealistic models from Z3 singularities\n\nThe replication of families is an intriguing feature of the above field theory.\nTo reproduce it from branes at singularities, the case of C3 /Z3 with the Z3\naction defined by (z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2192 (e2\u03c0i/3 z1 , e2\u03c0i/3z2 , e2\u03c0i/3 z3 ), is singled out, in\nthat it leads to natural triplication. The two examples we are to consider are\nbased on this singularity.\nThe first example we consider forms a subsector of the model considered in [31]. It is constructed by placing eleven D3-branes on the orientifold of the C3 /Z3 singularity, introduced in section 2.2.2. We choose\n9\n\n\f\u03b3\u03b8,3 = diag(1, e2\u03c0i/3 15 , e\u22122\u03c0i/3 15 ). Following our rules above, we obtain vector multiplets with gauge group SU(5) (the U(1) factor disappears from the\nlight spectrum as explained in section 2.1), and there are chiral multiplets\nin three copies of the representation 5 + 10. This spectrum resembles the\nstructure of SU(5) grand unified theories, which reproduce the spectrum of\nthe minimal supersymmetric standard model when an additional field in the\nadjoint representation is present to break SU(5) to the standard model group\nthrough the Higgs mechanism (an additional 5 + 5 pair is further required for\nelectroweak symmetry breaking). Unfortunately, all Higgs fields are absent\nin our field theory, which therefore is suggestive but not truly realistic.\nOur second example is based on the C3 /Z3 orbifold (rather than orientifold) singularity 2 , with Chan-Paton embedding \u03b3\u03b8,3 = diag(13 , e2\u03c0i/3 12 ,\ne\u22122\u03c0i/3 ). This embedding does not satisfy the tadpole cancellation condition\nstated in section 2.1 (the character of the representation of Z3 is non-zero).\nThe problem can be solved by introducing an additional set of D-branes,\nfor instance D7a -branes, with a = 1, 2, 3, wrapped on the complex surfaces\nza = 0, which do not break further supersymmetries. For non-compact spaces\nthese additional branes are non-dynamical, but they contribute additional\nfields in the four-dimensional world-volume of the D3-branes, arising from\nopen strings stretched between D3- and D7-branes. Hence the corresponding gauge field theories correspond to extended quivers, where additional\nnodes correspond to the global symmetries (symmetries on the D7-branes),\nand additional arrows correspond to 3-7 and 7-3 string states. These quiver\ndiagrams generalize to the threefold case those in [5]. Their moduli spaces\ntherefore provide a generalization of the Kronheimer-Nakajima construction\nof the moduli space of instantons on ALE spaces [34].\nThe Z3 acts on the space of D7-brane Chan-Paton indices, through matrices \u03b3\u03b8,7a . The modified tadpole cancellation conditions (which reduce\nP\nto a tr \u03b3\u03b8,7a + 3tr \u03b3\u03b8,3 = 0) are satisfied for the very symmetric choice\ntr \u03b3\u03b8,7a = \u2212tr \u03b3\u03b8,3, a = 1, 2, 3. Choosing e.g. \u03b3\u03b8,7a = diag(e2\u03c0i/3 , e\u22122\u03c0i/3 12 ) we\nobtain the following spectrum\n3 \u2212 3 strings\n\nGauge group\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)\nChiral multiplets 3 [ (3, 2)1/6 + (1, 2)1/2 + (3, 1)\u22122/3 ]\n3 \u2212 7a strings Chiral multiplets\n(3, 1)\u22121/3 + 2(1, 2)\u22121/2 +\na = 1, 2, 3\n+2(3, 1)1/3 + (1, 1)1\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThis model has been studied in[32] and is similar to a subsector of models in [33].\n\n10\n\n\fU(3)\n\nU(2)77\n\na\n\nU(1)77\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n0\n1\n0\nU(2) 1\n\na\n\n11\n00\n00U(1)\n11\n\nFigure 3: Quiver diagram of a system of D3- and D7-branes at a C3 /Z3 singularity, reproducing a spectrum close to the (minimal supersymmetric) standard\nmodel. The 3-7 sector is triplicated due to the three kinds of D7-branes we have\nintroduced. The dotted node and arrows are present in the generic quiver, but\nnot for our specific choice of Chan-Paton representations. Notice that white nodes\ncorrespond to global symmetries of the D3-brane field theory, and that only one\nof the three U (1) symmetries of the D3-branes survives at low energies.\n\nWe have included the charges under the only non-anomalous linear combinations of the U(1) factors in the original U(3) \u00d7 U(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge group.\nThis U(1) does not become massive and plays the role of hypercharge in the\nstandard model we have just constructed. The quiver diagram of this gauge\ntheory is shown in Figure 3.\nNotice how close to the spectrum in section 3.1 one can get using very\nsimple singularities. In particular, the later model differs from the MSSM\njust in that it produces three Higgs pairs instead of one, and in fact constitutes one of the simplest semi-realistic string models ever built. Since such\nconstructions would provide a rationale for the existence of three generations\n(one per complex transverse dimensions), and for hypercharge assignments\n(see [35] for discussion of hypercharge in a other brane contexts), we believe these examples illustrate the phenomenological interest of string theory\ncompactifications with branes at singularities.\n\nReferences\n11\n\n\f[1] P.
