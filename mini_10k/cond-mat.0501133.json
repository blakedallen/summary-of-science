Feldman\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0501133v2 [cond-mat.str-el] 13 Sep 2005\n\nDepartment of Physics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912\nWe study the effect of the voltage bias on the ferromagnetic phase transition in a one-dimensional\nitinerant electron system. The applied voltage drives the system into a nonequilibrium steady\nstate with a non-zero electric current. The bias changes the universality class of the second order\nferromagnetic transition. While the equilibrium transition belongs to the universality class of the\nuniaxial ferroelectric, we find the mean-field behavior near the nonequilibrium critical point.\n\nWhen external fields drive a many-body system into a nonequilibrium steady state, a parameter change may result\nin a transition between two nonequilibrium phases. Such nonequilibrium transitions were observed in 2D electron\ngases driven with microwave radiation [1, 2], granular matter [3], and many other systems. Scaling and universality\nhold near second order phase transitions both in and far from thermal equilibrium [4]. Hence, one can describe them\nwith renormalization group. This helped to achieve significant progress in the theory of nonequilibrium classical phase\ntransitions [4].\nThe possibility to achieve a high degree of isolation from environment for ultracold atoms [5] opens a way to\nstudy quantum dynamics in many-body systems far from equilibrium. This has stimulated interest to nonequilibrium\nquantum phase transitions of strongly interacting bosons [6]. Another type of nonequilibrium quantum transitions\nis possible in itinerant electron systems driven into states with nonzero electric current. In this Letter, we address a\nnonequilibrium ferromagnetic transition of 1D itinerant fermions. Since this transition exists only at zero temperature,\nit cannot be considered as a classical phenomenon, in contrast to the decay of supercurrents of interacting bosons\nthat can be understood as a classical modulational instability [6].\nEquilibrium magnetic phase transitions of itinerant electrons have attracted much attention [7, 8, 9, 10]. The\nquantum critical behavior at these transitions is a subtle and challenging problem due to the coexistence of two types\nof soft modes. In addition to the order parameter fluctuations, the theory must account for gapless fermions which\ninduce effective long-range interactions between the order parameter fields in different points [7]. Most studies have\nfocused on itinerant systems in two and three dimensions. According to the Lieb and Mattis theorem [11] there is\nno ferromagnetism in a wide class of one-dimensional models with spin-independent interactions. Yet ferromagnetic\nquantum phase transitions were found in many one-dimensional itinerant systems both with and without magnetic\nanisotropy. In particular, recent numerical simulations [12] discovered a quantum critical point in a tight-binding\nmodel with next nearest neighbor hoping. It was also argued [13] that the 0.7 anomaly in transport properties\nof quantum wires [13, 14] could be explained by spontaneous magnetization of itinerant electrons. Recently, the\nequilibrium quantum phase transition of itinerant electrons in 1D was theoretically investigated in Refs. 15, 16.\nIn this Letter we study the effect of a voltage bias on the quantum ferromagnetic transition in a one-dimensional\nitinerant electron system. A low voltage cannot significantly affect the magnetization far from the transition. However,\nit is a relevant perturbation in the critical domain and changes the universality class of the transition. While the\nequilibrium second order transition [16] belongs to the universality class of the uniaxial ferroelectric\n[17, 18, 19],\n\u221a\nwe find that the nonequilibrium critical behavior is mean-field like, i.e. the magnetization m \u223c r, where r is the\ndistance from the critical point.\nThe paper is organized as follows: first we introduce the model, then briefly discuss the phase transition within the\nmean-field Stoner approach, and finally show that the mean-field approximation gives the exact critical behavior.\nWe consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger model with the Hamiltonian\n\u001aX\n\u001b\nZ\nXZ\n\u2020\n\u2020\nH = dx\n[\u03c8\u03c3R\n(x)\u01eb(\u2212ih\u0304\u2202x )\u03c8\u03c3R (x) + \u03c8\u03c3L\n(x)\u01eb(\u2212ih\u0304\u2202x )\u03c8\u03c3L (x)] +\n(1)\ndyK\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (x \u2212 y)\u03c1\u03c3 (x)\u03c1\u03c3\u2032 (y) ,\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\nwhere \u03c8\u03c3R\nand \u03c8\u03c3L\nare the creation operators for right- and left-moving electrons with the spin z-component \u03c3 =\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u00b11/2, \u03c8\u03c3\u2020 = \u03c8\u03c3R\n+ \u03c8\u03c3L\ngives the conventional electron creation operator, \u03c1\u03c3 = \u03c8\u03c3\u2020 \u03c8\u03c3 is the electron density, and\nK\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (x \u2212 y) the interaction strength. We assume that the long-range Coulomb interaction is screened by the gates\nso that K\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (x \u2212 y) decreases rapidly for large (x \u2212 y). The spin dependence of K\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 determines the symmetry of\nthe model. As in Ref. 16 we will focus on the technically simplest case of the Ising symmetry Z2 \u00d7 U (1) (U (1) is\nresponsible for the conservation of Sz ; Z2 describes the symmetry with respect to the \u03c3 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3 transformation). Note\nthat the nonlinearity of the spectrum \u01eb(k) is relevant near the critical point. As discussed in Ref. 15 this nonlinearity\nis important for the very existence of the quantum critical point.\n\n\f2\nThe equilibrium transition in the model (1) was considered in Ref. 16. We will study what changes in the presence\nof a voltage bias. We will show that the non-equilibrium problem is equivalent to a certain equilibrium model which\nlacks the time-reversal symmetry. The absence of this symmetry is related to the fact that the \"Fermi velocities\" of\nthe right- and left-moving electrons are different. The critical behavior of the latter model can be found exactly. We\nwill show that the diagrams for the magnetization are free from infra-red divergencies. Hence, the system belongs to\nthe mean-field universality class.\nBefore we develop a systematic approach let us briefly discuss the simplified Stoner picture. Let the number of\nthe right/left-movers with spin \u03c3 be N0 + NR/L\u03c3 , where N0 denotesP\ntheP\nnumber of the states with the negative\nenergy \u01eb(k). The Stoner model is described by the Hamiltonian H = \u03c3 D=R,L U (ND\u03c3 ) \u2212 KM 2 , where U (n) =\nR 2\u03c0(N0 +n)\ndk\n\u01eb(k) 2\u03c0\n, and the magnetization M = (NR[1/2] + NL[1/2] \u2212 NR[\u22121/2] \u2212 NL[\u22121/2] )/2. The numbers of the\n2\u03c0N0\nright- and left-movers are integrals of motion. The chemical potentials of the right- and left-movers \u03bcR/L = \u00b1eV /2\nare different. Hence, at zero temperature the system is in the ground state of the effective Hamiltonian H \u2032 =\nH \u2212 \u03bcR NR \u2212 \u03bcL NL = H \u2212 V (NR[1/2] + NR[\u22121/2] \u2212 NL[1/2] \u2212 NL[\u22121/2] )/2. From the energy minimum condition\n\u2202H \u2032 /\u2202ND\u03c3 = 0 we find that the maximal energies \u01eb(k) of the right-moving particles with the opposite spins differ by\nR \u2206E\n2\u2206E = K \u2212\u2206E dE[\u03c1(E + V /2) + \u03c1(E \u2212 V /2)], where \u03c1(E) is the density of states. Expanding \u03c1(E \u00b1 V /2) in powers\nof E, V one finds \u2206E[1 \u2212 2K(\u03c1(0) + \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (0)V 2 /8)] \u2212 K\u2206E 3 \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (0)/3 = 0. This equation describes a second order phase\ntransition, if \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (0) < 0. The voltage bias shifts the transition to the\u221agreater interaction strength K = Kc , \u2206Kc \u223c V 2 .\nThe magnetization exhibits the mean-field behavior M \u223c \u2206E \u223c K \u2212 Kc . We will see below that the mean field\nprediction for the critical behavior of the magnetization is valid beyond the Stoner approximation.\nIn the Stoner picture, electrons move in a spin-dependent self-consistent field without backscattering. Hence, the\nelectric current is I = 2e2 V /h. The spin current Is = 0.\nIn a systematic approach, we need to include the leads into the model to describe the voltage bias. We use the\nstandard model [20, 21, 22, 23] for the Fermi-liquid leads adiabatically connected to the wire. We assume that the\nHamiltonian (1) is applicable for |x| < L only, where 2L is the wire length. At large |x| the interaction strength\nK(x \u2212 y) is zero. We assume that at the initial moment of time t = \u2212\u221e the interaction K\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 = 0. Thus, the numbers\nof the left- and right-movers are integrals of motion at t = \u2212\u221e. Hence, the initial state can be described in terms\nof two different chemical potentials \u03bcR = eV /2 and \u03bcL = \u2212eV /2 for the right- and left-moving electrons, where V\nis the voltage bias. At later times t > \u2212\u221e the interaction is gradually turned on. It is convenient to switch to\nthe interaction representation so that the Hamiltonian becomes H \u2032 = H \u2212 \u03bcL NL \u2212 \u03bcR NR , where NL and NR are\nthe numbers of the left- and right-movers. The initial state is the ground state of H \u2032 at t = \u2212\u221e. The interaction\nrepresentation introduces time dependence into the electron creation and annihilation operators. Hence, the evolution\nof the system should be described with the nonequilibrium Keldysh formalism [21, 22, 23, 24]. The bare Keldysh\nGreen functions are determined by the ground state of the Hamiltonian H \u2032 at t = \u2212\u221e. We will see however, that the\ntime-dependence drops out from the problem and a simpler equilibrium technique can be used.\nThe bosonization approach [25] allows one to reduce one-dimensional problems with strong electron interaction to\nmodels of weakly interacting bosons which can be studied perturbatively in the interaction strength. Following the\nstandard bosonization procedure we define four Bose-fields \u03c6\u03c3R and \u03c6\u03c3L such that\n\u03c8\u03c3R \u223c exp(i\u03c6\u03c3R + ikf R x \u2212 iV t/2); \u03c8\u03c3L \u223c exp(\u2212i\u03c6\u03c3L \u2212 ikf L x + iV t/2),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere kf R and kf L play the role of the effective\nand are proportional to the average electron\nP\nP \"Fermi momenta\"\ndensity of the right- and left-movers, \u03c1L/R = \u03c3 \u03c1\u03c3L/R = ( \u03c3 \u2202x \u03c6\u03c3L/R + 2kf L/R )/(2\u03c0), h\u03c1L/R i = kf L/R /\u03c0. We\nomit Klein factors in Eqs. (2) since they are not important for the following calculations. Two wave vectors kf L/R\ndiffer since the applied voltage bias leads to the different densities of the right- and left-moving electrons. In most\ncases this difference can be neglected since the voltage is much smaller than the bandwidth. However, it is important\nin our problem. The bosonized action contains two types of terms. The first type is a product of derivatives of the\nBose-fields with respect to t and x (\"forward scattering\" terms). The second type includes \"backscattering\"\nterms\nP\nproportional\nto\nexp(in[\u03c6\n/2\n+\n(k\n+\nk\n)x\n\u2212\nV\nt]\n+\nil\u03c6\n/2),\nwhere\nthe\ncharge\nand\nspin\nfields\n\u03c6\n=\n(\u03c6\n+\n\u03c6\u03c3L )\nc\nf\nR\nf\nL\ns\nc\n\u03c3R\n\u03c3\nP\nas\n\u03c1\n=\ne(\u2202\n\u03c6\n+\n2k\n+\n2k\n)/(2\u03c0)\nand\nand \u03c6s = \u03c3 2\u03c3(\u03c6\u03c3R + \u03c6\u03c3L ) are related to the charge and spin densities\nx\nc\nf\nL\nf\nR\nP\nP\nm = \u2202x \u03c6s /(4\u03c0); n and l are integers, (n + l) is even. The dual fields \u03b8c = \u03c3 (\u03c6\u03c3R \u2212 \u03c6\u03c3L ) and \u03b8s = \u03c3 2\u03c3(\u03c6\u03c3R \u2212 \u03c6\u03c3L )\ndo not appear in the exponents due to the conservation of the charge and the z-component of the magnetization. The\nterms of the second type with n 6= 0 are suppressed by their rapidly oscillating coordinate dependence. Hence, as\nusual in bosonization they are not important for the low-energy physics [25] which determines the critical behavior.\nWe will also see that the terms with n = 0, l 6= 0 are irrelevant near the phase transition. Thus, only the terms of\nthe first type should be taken into account. This means that the terms which should be included in the action do not\n\n\f3\n\nu\n\nk\nk\n\nk\nu\nk\n\nFIG. 1: The Ginzburg criterion requires the calculation of the above diagram.\n\ndepend on time explicitly. Hence, it becomes possible to use the equilibrium imaginary time formalism instead of the\nnon-equilibrium Keldysh technique [21, 22, 23, 24].\nThe Euclidean action contains four interacting chiral fields \u03c6\u03c3R/L :\n\nL=\n\nZ\n\ndxd\u03c4\n\n\u001a\n\n1 X\n[\u2202x \u03c6\u03c3R (i\u2202\u03c4 +vR \u2202x )\u03c6\u03c3R +\u2202x \u03c6\u03c3L (\u2212i\u2202\u03c4 +vL \u2202x )\u03c6\u03c3L ]+\n4\u03c0 \u03c3\n\nX\n\n\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 =\u00b11/2;D,D\u2032 =R,L\n\n\u001b\nu\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 DD\u2032 \u2202x \u03c6\u03c3D \u2202x \u03c6\u03c3\u2032 D\u2032 +. . . ,\n(3)\n\nd\u01eb(k=kf R/L )\nare different for the right\"Fermi velocities\" vR/L =\ndk\n\u03c6c , \u03c6s , \u03b8c , \u03b8s and integrate out \u03b8s and \u03b8c . The symmetry with\n\nwhere dots denote higher order terms. Note that the\nand left-movers. We rewrite the action in terms of\nrespect to the magnetization reversal results in the spin-charge separation, i.e. the quadratic part of the resulting\naction is the sum of a contribution which depends on \u03c6c only and a contribution that depends on \u03c6s only:\n(2)\nL(2) = L(2)\ns (\u03c6s ) + Lc (\u03c6c ).\n\n(4)\n\nIn general, the spin-charge separation does not extend beyond the terms quadratic in the Bose-fields. However, similar\nto Ref. 16 the interaction between the spin and charge degrees of freedom is not important near the phase transition.\nOne can show that this interaction does not change the critical behavior. Thus, we can focus on the case when\nEq. (4) is valid in all orders and hence the magnetization depends only on the spin part of the action Ls (\u03c6s ). A\nstraightforward modification of our approach demonstrates that our results are independent of this assumption (cf.\nRef. 16).\nAfter an appropriate rescaling of the time variable, the action takes the following form:\n\nL=\n\nZ\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n2\n2\nd\u03c4 dx\n[(\u2202\u03c4 \u03c6s ) + 2ic\u2202\u03c4 \u03c6s \u2202x \u03c6s + r(\u2202x \u03c6s ) ] + . . . ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the dots denote terms with higher powers of \u03c6s and/or gradients. The terms with an odd (even) number of\ntime derivatives are imaginary (real). The action (5) differs from the standard expression [25] due to the presence of\nthe second imaginary term. Technically this term appears because two \"Fermi velocities\" vR and vL are different.\nIts presence reflects the fact that the action (3) lacks time-reversal symmetry. In most problems the second term can\nbe neglected. Indeed, the constant c is proportional to the voltage bias which is much smaller than the bandwidth.\nIn particular, the second term is not important far from the transition since it is smaller than the sum of the first\nand third terms in (5). However, at the critical point, r vanishes and hence the second term is not negligible. At\nnegative r the quadratic part of the action (5) becomes unstable. This signals a phase transition. To make sure that\nthe system is stable at negative r one needs to take into account the contribution of the form L2,2 = b(\u2202x2 \u03c6s )2 and\nnonlinear terms such as L1,4 = u(\u2202x \u03c6s )4 denoted by dots in Eq. (5). L2,2 emerges from the coordinate dependence\nof the interaction K(x \u2212 y), Eq. (1), [16]. L1,4 describes the nonlinearity of the spectrum \u01eb(k) [26].\nIn the critical point the quadratic part of the action is thus proportional to (\u2202\u03c4 \u03c6s )2 + 2ic\u2202\u03c4 \u03c6s \u2202x \u03c6s + b(\u2202x2 \u03c6s )2 .\nAt each length scale 1/k the poles of the propagator determine two frequency scales \u03c91 \u223c k and \u03c92 \u223c k 3 . Hence,\nsimilar to other models of itinerant electron systems [9], the choice of scaling dimensions is subtle. Indeed, if the\nscaling dimension of the coordinate [x] = \u22121 then two different frequency scales correspond to [t] = \u22121 and [t] = \u22123.\nHowever, for any of these two choices, power counting yields a negative or zero scaling dimension for all possible\nnon-linear operators. This suggests the mean-field behavior. Below we show that the critical behavior is indeed\nmean-field-like without logarithmic corrections.\nThe idea of our calculations can be understood from the following example. According to the Ginzburg criterion,\ndeviations from the mean-field theory emerge if the diagram depicted in Fig. 1 diverges in the infra-red limit, i.e. when\n\n\f4\nR\nincoming momenta and frequencies are low. The diagram reduces to the integral I = dkd\u03c9k 4 /[\u03c9 2 R+ 2ic\u03c9k + bk 4 ]2 .\nWe substitute \u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212ick and shift the integration contour over \u03c9 \u2032 onto the real axis. This gives I = dkd\u03c9 \u2032 k 4 /[\u03c9 \u20322 +\nc2 k 2 + bk 4 ]2 . The latter integral converges.\nTo calculate the magnetization we add to the action a weak magnetic field term, \u2212hq iq\u03c6s (q)/(4\u03c0), where \u03c6s (q)\ndenotes a Fourier component of the spin Bose-field. The uniform field corresponds to the limit q \u2192 0. At h = 0\nthe magnetization is a non-analytic function of r but for any finite magnetic field the magnetization m depends on r\nanalytically [27, 28]. Thus, the critical behavior of the magnetization at small negative r can be determined with the\nfollowing three steps [27] : 1) calculate m = h\u2202x \u03c6s i/(4\u03c0) at r > 0 using the perturbation theory about the \u03c6s = 0\nstate; 2) analytically continue m(r) to negative r; 3) take the limit h \u2192 0. At r > 0 we get the standard result [27]\n\u001b\n\u221e\nX\n1\nh\n2n\u22121\n;\n\u2212\n\u03932n (r\u0303; q1 = . . . = q2n = \u03c91 = . . . = \u03c92n = 0)h\u2202x \u03c6s (x = 0)i\nh\u2202x \u03c6s (x = 0)i = C\n4\u03c0 n=2 (2n \u2212 1)!\n\n(6)\n\nC = lim lim q 2 G = 1/r\u0303; G = 1/[a\u03c9 2 + 2ic\u0303\u03c9q + r\u0303q 2 ],\n\n(7)\n\n\u001a\n\nq\u21920 \u03c9\u21920\n\nwhere \u03932n are the proper vertices at zero momentum and frequency, and a, c\u0303 and r\u0303 denote the renormalized coefficients\nof the Green function G. The formulas for the proper vertices contain integrals of the products of the expressions\nof the form p1 p2 G(\u03c9, q), where p1 , p2 = \u03c9, q. It is convenient to change variables: \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 + ic\u0303q/a. Then G \u2192 G\u2032 =\n1/[a\u03c9 \u20322 + (c\u03032 /a + r\u0303)q 2 ]. At r\u0303 > 0 the integration path Rfor integrals over d\u03c9 \u2032 can be deformed into the real axis.\n\u221e\n(One can show this, e.g., using the representation G\u2032 = 0 ds exp{\u2212s[a\u03c9 \u20322 + (c\u03032 /a + r\u0303)q 2 ]} in Feynman integrals.)\nThe resulting integrals have no infrared divergences at r\u0303 = 0. Expanding G\u2032 in powers of r\u0303 one can see that those\nintegrals are analytic functions of r\u0303 at small r\u0303. Thus, all coefficients of Eq. (6) are finite at r\u0303 = 0 and can be\nanalytically continued to negative\nr\u0303. Eq. (6) has the structure of the mean-field equation with the free energy\nP\nF = \u2212hm + r\u0303(4\u03c0m)2 /2 +\n\u03932n (r\u0303)(4\u03c0m)2n /(2n)!. Depending on the coefficients it may describe both first and\nsecond order phase transitions. A second order transition is possible for positive \u03934 (r\u0303 = 0). In this case the average\nmagnetization follows the mean-field laws:\n\nm(r\u0303 < 0, h = 0) \u223c\n\n\u221a\ndm(h = 0, r\u0303 > 0)\n1\n\u2212r\u0303;\n\u223c ; m(r\u0303 = 0, h) \u223c h1/3 .\ndh\nr\u0303\n\n(8)\n\nThe magnetization correlation function does not have the standard mean-field form. This is not surprising since\nin Luttinger liquids the correlation length is infinite for any r and not only in the critical point [25]. Using the\nperturbation theory about the state with \u2202x \u03c6s = 4\u03c0m(r) we find the large-distance behavior of the correlation\nfunction\nh(\u2202x \u03c6s (x = 0, t = 0) \u2212 4\u03c0m)(\u2202x \u03c6s (x = X, t = 0) \u2212 4\u03c0m)i = \u2212\u2202x2\n\nZ\n\ndkd\u03c9\nexp(ikX)G(\u03c9, k) \u223c 1/X 2 .\n4\u03c0 2\n\n(9)\n\nThe coefficient before 1/X 2 is a non-analytic function of r\u0303 near the phase transition.\nSo far we did not verify that cos(l\u03c6s ) is an irrelevant operator. This can be easily done with the renormalization\n<\n>\ngroup. At each step Rwe represent\n\u03c6s = 4\u03c0mx + \u03c6<\ns + \u03c6s as the sum of the average 4\u03c0mx, slow fluctuating part \u03c6s ,\nR\n\u221e\n>\nand fast part \u03c6s = \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 b\u039b<|k|<\u039b dk exp(i\u03c9\u03c4 + ikx)\u03c6s (\u03c9, k), where \u039b is the ultra-violet cutoff and b \u226a 1. We\nintegrate out the fast modes \u03c6>\ns and make the rescaling k \u2192 k/b, \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9/b. One can easily find the renormalization\n2 >2\nof the cosine\nterm\nin\nthe\nzero-loop\norder. Wep\nsee that cos(l\u03c6s ) \u2192 b\u22122 cos(4\u03c0lmx/b + l\u03c6<\ns ) exp(\u2212l h\u03c6s i/2), where\nR\nR\n>2\n2\nh\u03c6s i \u223c d\u03c9 b\u039b<|k|<\u039b dkG(\u03c9, k) \u223c \u2212(ln b)/ c\u0303 + a\u03ba|r\u0303|. Thus, the scaling dimension of the operator cos(l\u03c6s ),\np\n2 \u2212 const/ c\u03032 + a\u03ba|r\u0303|, is negative for small c\u0303 \u223c V and r\u0303. Hence, the operator is irrelevant near the phase transition.\nThe above perturbative argument applies only if the coefficients wl before cos(l\u03c6s ) are small. This explains why\nour results are valid in the case of the Ising symmetry Z2 \u00d7 U (1) but not for the Heisenberg symmetry group even\nthough the bosonized action has the same structure for both symmetries. Indeed, in the Heisenberg case w1 and r\nare related and cannot be simultaneously small [25].\nThe equilibrium ferromagnetic transition is described by the action L = (\u2202\u03c4 \u03c6s )2 /2+r(\u2202x \u03c6s )2 /2+b(\u2202x2 \u03c6s )4 +u(\u2202x \u03c6s )4\n[16]. After the substitution m = \u2202x \u03c6s /(4\u03c0) this action reduces to the free energy of the uniaxial ferroelectric [17].\nInterestingly, the same universality class emerges in a number of unrelated non-equilibrium classical problems with\n\n\f5\nconserved order parameter [18, 19] and in equilibrium quantum problems [29]. Long range dipole forces reduce the\ncritical dimension of the uniaxial ferroelectrics to 3. This is equivalent to 2 in the quantum problem. Non-equilibrium\neffects are known to suppress fluctuations in classical systems [19, 30]. Our results show that the same tendency\nexists in quantum itinerant systems with conserved Sz where the mean-field behavior is possible in 1D. On the other\nhand, non-equilibrium systems whose order parameter does not conserve exhibit typically the same critical behavior\nas corresponding equilibrium systems [31].\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the voltage bias modifies the critical behavior of one-dimensional itinerant\nelectrons near the ferromagnetic transition. The exact critical exponents are given by the mean field theory.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n\nR.
