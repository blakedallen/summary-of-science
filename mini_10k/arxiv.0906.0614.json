Introduction\nThe Sato-Tate conjecture is a conjecture about the distribution of the number\nof points on an elliptic curve over finite fields. Specifically, if E is an elliptic curve\nover Q without CM, then for each prime l such that E has good reduction at l we\nset\nal := 1 + l \u2212 #E(Fl ).\n\u221a\nThen the Sato-Tate conjecture states that the quantities cos\u22121 (al /2 l) are equidistributed with respect to the measure\n2\nsin2 \u03b8d\u03b8\n\u03c0\non [0, \u03c0]. Alternatively, by the Weil bounds for E, the polynomial\nX 2 \u2212 al X + l = (X \u2212 \u03b1l l1/2 )(X \u2212 \u03b2l l1/2 )\n\nsatisfies |\u03b1l | = |\u03b2l | = 1, and there is a well-defined conjugacy class xE,l in SU (2),\nthe conjugacy class of the matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b1l 0\n.\n0 \u03b2l\nThe Sato-Tate conjecture is then equivalent to the statement that the classes xE,l\nare equidistributed with respect to the Haar measure on SU (2).\nThe author was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0841491.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTOBY GEE\n\nTate observed that the conjecture would follow from properties of the symmetric\npower L-functions of E, specifically that these L-functions (suitably normalised)\nshould have nonvanishing analytic continuation to the region Rs \u2265 1. This would\nfollow (given the modularity of elliptic curves) from the Langlands conjectures\n(specifically, it would be a consequence of the symmetric power functoriality from\nGL2 to GLn for all n). Unfortunately, proving this functoriality appears to be\nwell beyond the reach of current techniques. However, Harris, Shepherd-Baron\nand Taylor observed that the required analytic properties would follow from a\nproof of the potential automorphy of the symmetric power L-functions (that is,\nthe automorphy of the L-functions after base change to some extension of Q), and\nwere able to use Taylor's potential automorphy techniques to prove the Sato-Tate\nconjecture for all elliptic curves E with non-integral j-invariant (see [HSBT09]).\nThere are various possible generalisations of the Sato-Tate conjecture; if one\nwishes to be maximally ambitious, one could consider equidistribution results for\nthe Satake parameters of rather general automorphic representations (see for example section 2 of [Lan79]). Again, such results appear to be well beyond the range\nof current technology. There is, however, one special case that does seem to be\nreasonable to attack, which is the case of Hilbert cuspidal eigenforms of regular\nweight. In this paper, we prove a natural generalisation of the Sato-Tate conjecture\nfor modular newforms (over Q) of weight 2 or 3, subject to the natural analogue\nof the condition that an elliptic curve has non-integral j-invariant. We note that\npreviously the only modular forms for which the conjecture was known were those\ncorresponding to elliptic curves; in particular, there were no examples of weight 3\nmodular forms for which the conjecture was known. After this paper was made\navailable, the conjecture was proved for all modular forms of weight at least 2 in\n[BLGHT09], by rather different methods.\nOur approach is similar to that of [HSBT09], and we are fortunate in being able\nto quote many of their results. Indeed, it is straightforward to check that Tate's\nargument shows that the conjecture would follow from the potential automorphy of\nthe symmetric powers of the l-adic Galois representations associated to a modular\nform. One might then hope to prove this potential automorphy in the style of\n[HSBT09]; one would proceed by realising the symmetric powers of the mod l Galois\nrepresentation geometrically in such a way that their potential automorphy may be\nestablished, and then deduce the potential automorphy of the l-adic representations\nby means of the modularity lifting theorems of [CHT08] and [Tay08].\nIt turns out that this simple strategy encounters some significant obstacles. First\nand foremost, it is an unavoidable limitation of the known potential automorphy\nmethods that they can only deduce that a mod l Galois representation is automorphic of minimal weight (which we refer to as \"weight 0\"). However, the symmetric\npowers of the Galois representations corresponding to modular forms of weight\ngreater than 2 are never automorphic of minimal weight, so one has no hope of\ndirectly proving their potential automorphy in the fashion outlined above without\nsome additional argument. If, for example, one knew the weight part of Serre's\nconjecture for GLn (or even for unitary groups) one would be able to deduce the\nrequired results, but this appears to be an extremely difficult problem in general.\nThere is, however, one case in which the analysis of the Serre weights is rather\neasier, which is the case that the l-adic Galois representations are ordinary. It is\nthis observation that we exploit in this paper.\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n3\n\nIn general, it is anticipated that for a given newform f of weight k \u2265 2, there is a\ndensity one set of primes l such that there is an ordinary l-adic Galois representation\ncorresponding to f . Unfortunately, if k > 3 then it is not even known that there\nis an infinite set of such primes; this is the reason for our restriction to k = 2\nor 3. In these cases, one may use the Ramanujan conjecture and Serre's form of\nthe Cebotarev density theorem (see [Ser81]) to prove that the set of l which are\n\"ordinary\" in this sense has density one, via an argument that is presumably wellknown to the experts (although we have not been able to find the precise argument\nthat we use in the literature). We note that it is important for us to be able to\nchoose l arbitrarily large in certain arguments (in order to satisfy the hypotheses\nof the automorphy lifting theorems of [Tay08]), so it does not appear to be possible\nto apply our methods to any modular forms of weight greater than 3. Similarly, we\ncannot prove anything for Hilbert modular forms of parallel weight 3 over any field\nother than Q.\nWe now outline our arguments in more detail, and explain exactly what we\nprove. The early sections of the paper are devoted to proving the required potential automorphy results. In section 2 we recall some basic definitions and results\nfrom [CHT08] on the existence of Galois representations attached to regular automorphic representations of GLn over totally real and CM fields, subject to suitable\nself-duality hypotheses and to the existence of finite places at which the representations are square integrable. Section 3 recalls some standard results on the Galois\nrepresentations attached to modular forms, and proves the result mentioned above\non the existence of a density one set of primes for which there is an ordinary Galois\nrepresentation.\nIn section 4 we prove the potential automorphy in weight 0 of the symmetric powers of the residual Galois representations associated to a modular form, under the\nhypotheses that the residual Galois representation is ordinary and irreducible, and\nthe automorphic representation corresponding to the modular form is an unramified twist of the Steinberg representation at some finite place. The latter condition\narises because of restrictions of our knowledge as to when there are Galois representations associated to automorphic representations on unitary groups, and it is\nanticipated that it will be possible to remove it in the near future. That would\nthen allow us to prove our main theorems for any modular forms of weights 2 or 3\nwhich are not of CM type. (Note added in proof: such results are now available, cf.\n[Shi09], [CH09], [Gue09], and it is thus an easy exercise to deduce our main results\nwithout any Steinberg assumption.)\nOne approach to proving the potential automorphy result in weight 0 would be\nto mimic the proofs for elliptic curves in [HSBT09]. In fact we can do better than\nthis, and are able to directly utilise their results. We are reduced to proving that\nafter making a quadratic base change and twisting, the mod l representation attached to our modular form is, after a further base change, congruent to a mod\nl representation arising from a certain Hilbert-Blumenthal abelian variety. This\nis essentially proved in [Tay02], and we only need to make minor changes to the\nproofs in [Tay02] in order to deduce the properties we need. We can then directly\napply one of the main results of [HSBT09] to deduce the automorphy of the evendimensional symmetric powers of the Hilbert-Blumenthal abelian variety, and after\ntwisting back we deduce the required potential automorphy of our residual representations. Note that apart from resulting in rather clean proofs, the advantage\n\n\f4\n\nTOBY GEE\n\nof making an initial congruence to a Galois representation attached to an abelian\nvariety and then using the potential automorphy of the symmetric powers of this\nabelian variety is that we are able to obtain local-global compatibility at all finite\nplaces (including those dividing the residue characteristic). This compatibility is\nnot yet available for automorphic representations on unitary groups in general, and\nis needed in our subsequent arguments. In particular, it tells us that the automorphic representations of weight 0 which correspond to the symmetric powers of\nthe l-adic representations coming from our Hilbert-Blumenthal abelian variety are\nordinary at l.\nIn section 5 we exploit this ordinarity to deduce that the even-dimensional symmetric powers of the mod l representations are potentially automorphic of the\n\"correct\" weight. This is a basic consequence of Hida theory for unitary groups,\nbut we are not aware of any reference that proves the precise result we need. Accordingly, we provide a proof in the style of the arguments of [Tay88]. There is\nnothing original in this section, and as the arguments are somewhat technical the\nreader may wish to skip it on a first reading.\nThe results of the preceding sections are combined in section 6 to establish the\nrequired potential automorphy results for l-adic (rather than mod l) representations. This essentially comes down to checking the hypotheses of the modularity\nlifting theorem that we wish to apply from [Tay08], which follow from the analogous\narguments in [HSBT09] together with the conditions that we have imposed in our\npotential automorphy arguments. It is here that we need the freedom to choose l\nto be arbitrarily large, which results in our restriction to weights 2 and 3.\nFinally, in section 7 we deduce the form of the Sato-Tate conjecture mentioned\nabove. As in [HSBT09] we have only proved the potential automorphy of the evendimensional symmetric powers of the l-adic representations associated to our modular form, and we deduce the required analytic properties for the L-functions attached to odd-dimensional symmetric powers via an argument with Rankin-Selberg\nconvolutions exactly analogous to that of [HSBT09]. In fact, we need to prove the\nsame results for the L-functions of certain twists of our representations by finiteorder characters, but this is no more difficult.\nWe now describe the form of the final result, which is slightly different from that\nfor elliptic curves, because our modular forms may have non-trivial nebentypus\n(and indeed are required to do so if they have weight 3). Suppose that the newform\nf has level N , nebentypus \u03c7f and weight k; then the image of \u03c7f is precisely the\nm-th roots of unity for some m. Then if p \u2224 N is a prime, we know that if\nX 2 \u2212 ap X + pk\u22121 \u03c7f (p) = (X \u2212 \u03b1p p(k\u22121)/2 )(X \u2212 \u03b2p p(k\u22121)/2 )\nwhere ap is the eigenvalue of f for the Hecke operator Tp , then the matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b1p 0\n0 \u03b2p\ndefines a conjugacy class xf,p in U (2)m , the subgroup of U (2) of matrices with\ndeterminant an m-th root of unity. Then our main result is\nTheorem. If f has weight 2 or 3 and the associated automorphic representation is a\ntwist of the Steinberg representation at some finite place, then the conjugacy classes\nxf,p are equidistributed with respect to the Haar measure on U (2)m (normalised so\nthat U (2)m has measure 1).\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n5\n\nOne can make this more concrete by restricting to primes p such that \u03c7f (p) is a\nspecific m-th root of unity; see the remarks at the end of section 7.\nWe would like to thank Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty and Richard\nTaylor for various helpful discussions during the writing of this paper.\n2. Notation and assumptions\nWe let \u01eb denote the l-adic cyclotomic character, regarded as a character of the\nabsolute Galois group of a number field or of a completion of a number field at\na finite place. We sometimes use the same notation for the mod l cyclotomic\ncharacter; it will always be clear from the context which we are referring to. We\ndenote Tate twists in the usual way, i.e. \u03c1(n) := \u03c1 \u2297 \u01ebn . We write K\u0304 for a separable\nclosure of a field K. If x is a finite place of a number field F , we will write Ix for\nthe inertia subgroup of Gal(F x /Fx ). We fix an algebraic closure Q of Q, and regard\nall finite extensions of Q as being subfields of Q. We also fix algebraic closures Qp\nof Qp for all primes p, and embeddings Q \u0592\u2192 Qp .\nWe need several incarnations of the local Langlands correspondence. Let K be\na finite extension of Qp , and l 6= p a prime. We have a canonical isomorphism\nab\nArtK : K \u00d7 \u2192 WK\n\nnormalised so that geometric Frobenius elements correspond to uniformisers. Let\nIrr(GLn (K)) denote the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible admissible representations of GLn (K) over C, and let WDRepn (WK ) denote the set of isomorphism\nclasses of n-dimensional Frobenius semi-simple complex Weil-Deligne representations of the Weil group WK of K. The main result of [HT01] is that there is a\nfamily of bijections\nrecK : Irr(GLn (K)) \u2192 WDRepn (WK )\nsatisfying a number of properties that specify them uniquely (see the introduction\nto [HT01] for a complete list). Among these properties are:\n\u2022 If \u03c0 \u2208 Irr(GL1 (K)) then recK (\u03c0) = \u03c0 \u25e6 Art\u22121\nK .\n\u2022 recK (\u03c0 \u2228 ) = recK (\u03c0)\u2228 .\n\u2022 If \u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n \u2208 Irr(GL1 (K)) are such that the normalised induction n-Ind(\u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n )\nis irreducible, then\nrecK (n-Ind(\u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n )) = \u2295ni=1 recK (\u03c7i ).\nWe will often just write rec for recK when the choice of K is clear from the context.\nAfter choosing an isomorphism \u03b9 : Ql \u2192 C one obtains bijections recl from the set of\nisomorphism classes of irreducible admissible representations of GLn (K) over Ql to\nthe set of isomorphism classes of n-dimensional Frobenius semi-simple Weil-Deligne\nQl -representations of WK . We then define rl (\u03c0) to be the l-adic representation of\nGal(K/K) associated to recl (\u03c0 \u2228 \u2297|*|(1\u2212n)/2 ) whenever this exists (that is, whenever\nthe eigenvalues of recl (\u03c0 \u2228 \u2297 | * |(1\u2212n)/2 )(\u03c6) are l-adic units, where \u03c6 is a Frobenius\nelement). We will, of course, only use this notation where it makes sense. It is\nuseful to note that\nrl (\u03c0)\u2228 (1 \u2212 n) = rl (\u03c0 \u2228 ).\nLet M denote a CM field with maximal totally real subfield F (by \"CM field\"\nwe always mean \"imaginary CM field\"). We denote the nontrivial element of\n\n\f6\n\nTOBY GEE\n\nGal(M/F ) by c. Following [CHT08] we define a RACSDC (regular, algebraic, conjugate self dual, cuspidal) automorphic representation of GLn (AM ) to be a cuspidal\nautomorphic representation \u03c0 such that\n\u2022 \u03c0\u2228 \u223c\n= \u03c0 c , and\n\u2022 \u03c0\u221e has the same infinitesimal character as some irreducible algebraic representation of ResM/Q GLn .\nWe say that a \u2208 (Zn )Hom(M,C) is a weight if\n\u2022 a\u03c4,1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 a\u03c4,n for all \u03c4 \u2208 Hom(M, C), and\n\u2022 a\u03c4 c,i = \u2212a\u03c4,n+1\u2212i .\n\nFor any weight a we may form an irreducible algebraic representation Wa of GLHom(M,C)\n,\nn\nthe tensor product over \u03c4 of the irreducible algebraic representations of GLn with\nhighest weight a\u03c4 . We say that \u03c0 has weight a if it has the same infinitesimal character as Wa\u2228 ; note that any RACSDC automorphic representation has some weight.\nLet S be a non-empty finite set of finite places of M . For each v \u2208 S, choose an\nirreducible square integrable representation \u03c1v of GLn (Mv ) (in this paper, we will\nin fact only need to consider the case where each \u03c1v is the Steinberg representation). We say that an RACSDC automorphic representation \u03c0 has type {\u03c1v }v\u2208S\nif for each v \u2208 S, \u03c0v is an unramified twist of \u03c1\u2228\nv .

This follows from Proposition 4.2.1 of [CHT08] (which in fact also gives\ninformation on rl,\u03b9 |Gal(M v /Mv ) for places v|l).\n\u0003\nThe representation rl,\u03b9 (\u03c0) may be conjugated to be valued in the ring of integers\nof a finite extension of Ql , and we may reduce it modulo the maximal ideal of this\nring of integers and semisimplify to obtain a well-defined continuous representation\nr\u0304l,\u03b9 (\u03c0) : Gal(M /M ) \u2192 GLn (Fl ).\n\u223c\n\nLet a \u2208 (Zn )Hom(M,Ql ) , and let \u03b9 : Ql \u2212\u2192 C.

If r : Gal(M /M ) \u2192 GLn (Ql ), we say that r is automorphic of weight\na and type {\u03c1v }v\u2208S if r \u223c\n= rl,\u03b9 (\u03c0) for some RACSDC automorphic representation \u03c0\nof weight \u03b9\u2217 a and type {\u03b9\u03c1v }v\u2208S . Similarly, if r\u0304 : Gal(M /M ) \u2192 GLn (Fl ), we say\nthat r\u0304 is automorphic of weight a and type {\u03c1v }v\u2208S if r\u0304 \u223c\n= r\u0304l,\u03b9 (\u03c0) for some RACSDC\nautomorphic representation \u03c0 with \u03c0l unramified, of weight \u03b9\u2217 a and type {\u03b9\u03c1v }v\u2208S .\nWe now consider automorphic representations of GLn (AF ). We say that a cuspidal automorphic representation \u03c0 of GLn (AF ) is RAESDC (regular, algebraic,\nessentially self dual, cuspidal) if\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n7\n\n\u00d7\nwith \u03c7v (\u22121) independent\n\u2022 \u03c0\u2228 \u223c\n= \u03c7\u03c0 for some character \u03c7 : F \u00d7 \\A\u00d7\nF \u2192 C\nof v|\u221e, and\n\u2022 \u03c0\u221e has the same infinitesimal character as some irreducible algebraic representation of ResF/Q GLn .\n\nWe say that a \u2208 (Zn )Hom(F,C) is a weight if\n\na\u03c4,1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 a\u03c4,n\n\nfor all \u03c4 \u2208 Hom(F, C). For any weight a we may form an irreducible algebraic\nrepresentation Wa of GLnHom(F,C) , the tensor product over \u03c4 of the irreducible algebraic representations of GLn with highest weight a\u03c4 . We say that an RAESDC\nautomorphic representation \u03c0 has weight a if it has the same infinitesimal character\nas Wa\u2228 . In this case, by the classification of algebraic characters over a totally real\nfield, we must have a\u03c4,i + a\u03c4,n+1\u2212i = wa for some wa independent of \u03c4 . Let S be\na non-empty finite set of finite places of F . For each v \u2208 S, choose an irreducible\nsquare integrable representation \u03c1v of GLn (Mv ).

This is Proposition 4.3.1 of [CHT08] (which again obtains a stronger result,\ngiving information on rl,\u03b9 |Gal(F v /Fv ) for places v|l).\n\u0003\nAgain, the representation rl,\u03b9 (\u03c0) may be conjugated to be valued in the ring\nof integers of a finite extension of Ql , and we may reduce it modulo the maximal\nideal of this ring of integers and semisimplify to obtain a well-defined continuous\nrepresentation\nr\u0304l,\u03b9 (\u03c0) : Gal(F /F ) \u2192 GLn (Fl ).\n\u223c\n\nLet a \u2208 (Zn )Hom(F,Ql ) , and let \u03b9 : Ql \u2212\u2192 C. Define \u03b9\u2217 a \u2208 (Zn )Hom(F,C) by\n(\u03b9\u2217 a)\u03b9\u03c4,i = a\u03c4,i . Let \u03c1v be a discrete series representation of GLn (Mv ) over Ql for\neach v \u2208 S. If r : Gal(F /F ) \u2192 GLn (Ql ), we say that r is automorphic of weight a\nand type {\u03c1v }v\u2208S if r \u223c\n= rl,\u03b9 (\u03c0) for some RAESDC automorphic representation \u03c0 of\nweight \u03b9\u2217 a and type {\u03b9\u03c1v }v\u2208S .

Modular forms\n3.1. Let f be a cuspidal newform of level \u03931 (N ), nebentypus \u03c7f , and weight k \u2265 2.\nSuppose that for each prime p \u2224 N we have Tp f = ap f . Then each ap is an algebraic\ninteger, and the set {ap } generates a number field Kf with ring of integers Of . We\nwill view Kf as a subfield of C. It is known that Kf contains the image of \u03c7f . For\neach place \u03bb|l of Of there is a continuous representation\n\u03c1f,\u03bb : Gal(Q/Q) \u2192 GL2 (Kf,\u03bb )\n\nwhich is determined up to isomorphism by the property that for all p \u2224 N l, \u03c1f,\u03bb |Gal(Qp /Qp )\nis unramified, and the characteristic polynomial of \u03c1f,\u03bb (Frobp ) is X 2 \u2212 ap X +\npk\u22121 \u03c7f (p) (where Frobp is a choice of a geometric Frobenius element at p).\nAssume from now on that f is not of CM type.\nDefinition 3.1. Let \u03bb be a prime of Of lying over a rational prime l. Then we\nsay that f is ordinary at \u03bb if \u03bb \u2224 al . We say that f is ordinary at l if it is ordinary\nat \u03bb for some \u03bb|l.\nLemma 3.2. If k = 2 or 3, then the set of primes l such that f is ordinary at l\nhas density one.\nProof. The proof is based on an argument of Wiles (see the final lemma of [Wil88]).\nLet S be the finite set of primes which either divide N or which are ramified in\nOf . Suppose that f is not ordinary at p \u2208\n/ S. By definition we have\nQ that \u03bb|ap for\neach prime \u03bb of Of lying over p. Since p is unramified in Of , (p) = \u03bb|p \u03bb, so p|ap .\nWrite ap = pbp with bp \u2208 Of .\nSince p \u2224 N , the Weil bounds (that is, the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture) tell\nus that for each embedding \u03b9 : Kf \u0592\u2192 C we have |\u03b9(ap )| \u2264 2p(k\u22121)/2 . Since k \u2264 3,\nthis implies that |\u03b9(bp )| \u2264 2 for all \u03b9. Let T be the set of y \u2208 Of such that |\u03b9(y)| \u2264 2\nfor all \u03b9. This is a finite set, because one can bound the absolute values of the\ncoefficients of the characteristic polynomial of such a y.\nFrom the above analysis, it is sufficient to prove that for each y \u2208 T , the set of\nprimes p for which ap = py has density zero. However, by Corollaire 1 to Th\u00e9or\u00e8me\n15 of [Ser81], the number of primes p \u2264 x for which ap = py is O(x/(log x)5/4\u2212\u03b4 )\nfor any \u03b4 > 0, which immediately shows that the density of such primes is zero, as\nrequired.\n\u0003\nThe following result is well known, and follows from, for example, [Sch90] and\nTheorem 2 of [Wil88].\nLemma 3.3. If f is ordinary at a place \u03bb|l of Of , and l \u2224 N , then the Galois\nrepresentation \u03c1f,\u03bb is crystalline, and furthermore it is ordinary; that is,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c81\n\u2217\n\u223c\n\u03c1f,\u03bb |Gal(Ql /Ql ) =\n0 \u03c82 \u01eb1\u2212k\nwhere \u03c81 and \u03c82 are unramified characters of finite order. In addition, \u03c81 takes\nFrobl to the unit root of X 2 \u2212 al X + \u03c7f (l)lk\u22121 .\n3.2. Let \u03c1f,\u03bb denote the semisimplification of the reduction mod \u03bb of \u03c1f,\u03bb ; this\nmakes sense because \u03c1f,\u03bb may be conjugated to take values in GL2 (Of,\u03bb ), and it\nis independent of the choice of lattice. It is valued in GL2 (kf,\u03bb ), where kf,\u03bb is the\nresidue field of Kf,\u03bb .\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n9\n\nDefinition 3.4.

The following result is essentially due to Ribet (see [Rib75], which\ntreats the case N = 1; for a concrete reference, which also proves the corresponding\nresult for Hilbert modular forms, see [Dim05]).\nLemma 3.5. For all but finitely many primes \u03bb of Of , \u03c1f,\u03bb has large image.\n3.3. We let \u03c0(f ) be the automorphic representation of GL2 (AQ ) corresponding to\nf , normalised so that \u03c0(f ) is RAESDC of weight (k \u2212 2, 0) (it is essentially self dual\nbecause\n\u03c0(f )\u2228 \u223c\n= \u03c7\u03c0(f )\n\nwhere \u03c7 = | * |k\u22122 \u03c7\u22121\nf ). Let \u03bb|l be a place of Of , and choose an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\u03b9 : Ql \u2212\u2192 C and a compatible embedding Kf,\u03bb \u0592\u2192 Ql ; that is, an embedding such\nthat the diagram\n/C\nKf\nO\n\u03b9\n\n\u000f\n\nKf,\u03bb\n\n/Q\nl\n\ncommutes.

We say that f is potentially Steinberg at a prime q if \u03c0(f )q is a\n(possibly ramified) twist of the Steinberg representation.\nNote that if f is (potentially) Steinberg at q for some q then it is not CM. Note\nalso that if f is potentially Steinberg at q then there is a Dirichlet character \u03b8 such\nthat f \u2297 \u03b8 is Steinberg at q.\n4. Potential automorphy in weight 0\n4.1. Let l be an odd prime, and let f be a modular form of weight 2 \u2264 k < l and\nlevel N , l \u2224 N . Assume that f is Steinberg at q. Suppose that \u03bb|l is a place of Of\nsuch that f is ordinary at \u03bb. Assume that \u03c1f,\u03bb is absolutely irreducible.

We wish to prove that the symmetric\npowers of \u03c1f,\u03bb are potentially automorphic of some weight. To do so, we use a\n\n\f10\n\nTOBY GEE\n\npotential modularity argument to realise \u03c1f,\u03bb geometrically, and then appeal to the\nresults of [HSBT09].\nThe potential modularity result that we need is almost proved in [Tay02]; the one\nmissing ingredient is that we wish to preserve the condition of being Steinberg at\nq. This is, however, easily arranged, and rather than repeating all of the arguments\nof [Tay02], we simply indicate the modifications required.\nWe begin by recalling some definitions from [Tay02]. Let N be a totally real\nfield. Then an N -HBAV over a field K is a triple (A, i, j) where\n\u2022 A/K is an abelian variety of dimension [N : Q],\n\u2022 i : ON \u0592\u2192 End(A/K), and\n+ \u223c\n\u2022 j : ON\n\u2212\u2192 P(A, i) is an isomorphism of ordered invertible ON -modules.\n\n+\nFor the definitions of ordered invertible ON -modules and of ON\nand P(A, i), see\npage 133 of [Tay02].\nChoose a totally real quadratic field F in which l is inert and q is unramified\nker(\u03c1f,\u03bb )\nover Q, a finite extension k/kf,\u03bb and\nand which is linearly disjoint from Q\na character \u03b8 : Gal(F /F ) \u2192 k \u00d7 which is unramified at q such that\n\ndet \u03c1f,\u03bb |Gal(F /F ) = \u01eb\u22121 \u03b8\n\n\u22122\n\nand (\u03c1f,\u03bb |Gal(F /F ) \u2297 \u03b8)(Frobw ) has eigenvalues 1, #k(w), where w|q is a place of F .\nThis is possible as the obstruction to taking a square root of a character is in the\n2-part of the Brauer group, and because any class in the Brauer group of a local\nfield splits over an unramified extension. Let \u03c1 = \u03c1f,\u03bb |Gal(F /F ) \u2297 \u03b8 : Gal(F /F ) \u2192\nGL2 (k), so that det \u03c1 = \u01eb\u22121 . If x is the place of F lying over l, then we may write\n(for some character \u03c7x of Gal(Fx /Fx ))\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u22121\n\u03c7x\n\u2217\n\u03c1|Gal(Fx /Fx ) \u223c\n=\n\u03c7x \u01eb\u22121\n0\nwith \u03c72x |Ix = \u01eb2\u2212k .\nTheorem 4.1. There is a finite totally real Galois extension E/F which is linearly\nker(\u03c1\n\n)\n\nf,\u03bb\nover Q and in which the unique prime of F dividing l splits\ndisjoint from Q\ncompletely, a totally real field N , a place \u03bb\u2032 |l of N , a place vq |q of E, and an\nN -HBAV (A, i, j)/E with potentially good reduction at all places dividing l such\nthat\n\u2022 the representation of Gal(\u0112/E) on A[\u03bb\u2032 ] is equivalent to (\u03c1|Gal(\u0112/E) )\u2228 ,\n\u2022 at each place x|l of E, the action of Gal(Ex /Ex ) on T\u03bb\u2032 A \u2297 Ql is of the\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u22121\n\u03c7x \u01eb \u2217\n0\n\u03c7x\n\nwith \u03c7x a tamely ramified lift of \u03c7x , and\n\u2022 A has multiplicative reduction at vq .\nProof. As remarked above, this is essentially proved in [Tay02]. Indeed, if k > 2\nthen with the exception of the fact that E can be chosen to be linearly disjoint\nker(\u03c1f,\u03bb )\nfrom Q\nover Q, and the claim that A can be chosen to have multiplicative\nreduction at some place over q, the result is obtained on page 136 of [Tay02] (the\nexistence of A with A[\u03bb\u2032 ] equivalent to (\u03c1|Gal(\u0112/E) )\u2228 is established in the second\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n11\n\nparagraph on that page, and the form of the action of Gal(Ex /Ex ) for x|l follows\nfrom Lemma 1.5 of loc. cit. ).\nWe now indicate the modifications needed to the arguments of [Tay02] to obtain\nthe slight strengthening that we require. Suppose firstly that k > 2. Rather than\nemploying the theorem of Moret-Bailly stated as Theorem G of [Tay02], we use\nthe variant given in Proposition 2.1 of [HSBT09]. This immediately allows us\nker(\u03c1\n\n)\n\nf,\u03bb\nto assume that E is linearly disjoint from Q\nover Q, so we only need to\nensure that A has multiplicative reduction at some place dividing q. Let X be\nthe moduli space defined in the first paragraph of page 136 of [Tay02]. Let v be\na place of F lying over q. It is enough to check that there is a non-empty open\nsubset \u03a9v of X(Fv ) such that for each point of \u03a9v , the corresponding N -HBAV has\nmultiplicative reduction. Let \u03a9v denote the set of all points of X(Fv ) such that\nthe corresponding N -HBAV has multiplicative reduction; this is an open subset of\nX(Fv ), and it is non-empty (by the assumptions on \u03b8\u0304 at places of F dividing q, and\nthe assumption that \u03c0(f ) is an unramified twist of the Steinberg representation,\nwe see that \u03c1(Frobv ) has eigenvalues 1 and #k(v), and is congruent to a Galois\nrepresentation attached to an unramified twist of a Steinberg representation, so\nany N -HBAV with multiplicative reduction suffices), as required.\nIf k = 2, then the only additional argument needed is one to ensure that if\n\u03c72x = 1, then the abelian variety can be chosen to have good reduction rather\nthan multiplicative reduction. This follows easily from the fact that \u03c1|Gal(Fx /Fx ) is\nfinite flat (cf. the proof of Theorem 2.1 of [KW08], which establishes a very similar\nresult).\n\u0003\n\nLet M be a totally real field, and let (A, i, j)/M be an N -HBAV. Fix an embedding N \u2282 R. We recall some definitions from section 4 of [HSBT09]. For each finite\nplace v of M there is a two dimensional Weil-Deligne representation WDv (A, i)\ndefined over N such that if p is a place of N of residue characteristic p different\nfrom the residue characteristic of v, we have\n\u2297N N p ) \u223c\nWD(H 1 (A \u00d7 M , Qp )|\n= WDv (A, i) \u2297 N p .\nGal(M v /Mv )\n\np\n\nN\n\nm\n\nDefinition 4.2. We say that Sym A is automorphic of type {\u03c1v }v\u2208S if there is\nan RAESDC representation \u03c0 of GLm+1 (AM ) of weight 0 and type {\u03c1v }v\u2208S such\nthat for all finite places v of M ,\n\u22121 \u2212m/2\nrec(\u03c0v )| ArtM\n|\n= Symm WDv (A, i).\nv\n\nTheorem 4.3. Let E, A be as in the statement of Theorem 4.1. Let N be a finite\nset of even positive integers. Then there is a finite Galois totally real extension\nF \u2032 /E and a place wq |q of F \u2032 such that\n\u2022 for any n \u2208 N , Symn\u22121 A is automorphic over F \u2032 of weight 0 and type\n{Spn (1)}{wq } ,\n\u2022 The primes of E dividing l are unramified in F \u2032 , and\nker(\u03c1f,\u03bb )\n\u2022 F \u2032 is linearly disjoint from Q\nover Q.\nProof. This is essentially Theorem 4.1 of [HSBT09]. In particular, the proof in\n[HSBT09] establishes that there is a Galois totally real extension F \u2032 /E, and a\nplace wq of F \u2032 lying over q such that for any n \u2208 N , Symn\u22121 A is automorphic over\nF \u2032 of weight 0 and type {Spn (1)}{wq } . Note that the l used in their argument is not\nthe l used here. To complete the proof, we need to establish that it is possible to\n\n\f12\n\nTOBY GEE\nker(\u03c1\n\n)\n\nf,\u03bb\nobtain an F \u2032 in which l is unramified, and which is linearly disjoint from Q\nover Q. The latter point causes no difficulty, but the first point requires some\nminor modifications of the arguments of [HSBT09]. We now outline the necessary\nchanges.\nTo aid comparison to [HSBT09], for the rest of this proof we will refer to our l as\ns; all references to l will be to primes of that name in the proofs of various theorems\nin [HSBT09]. We begin by choosing a finite solvable totally real extension L of E,\n\nker(\u03c1\n\n)\n\nf,\u03bb\nover Q, such that the base change of A to L has\nlinearly disjoint from Q\ngood reduction at all places dividing s. Choose a prime l as in the proof of Theorem\n4.1 of [HSBT09]. We then apply a slight modification of Theorem 4.2 of loc.cit.,\nwith the conclusion strengthened to include the hypothesis that s is unramified in\nF \u2032 . To prove this, in the proof of Theorem 4.2 of loc.cit., note that F1 = E. Choose\nall auxiliary primes not to divide s. Rather than constructing a moduli space XW\nover E, construct the analogous space over L, and consider the restriction of scalars\nY = ResL/E (XW ). Applying Proposition 2.1 of [HSBT09] to Y , rather than XW ,\nwe may find a finite totally real Galois extension F (1) /E in which s is unramified,\nsuch that Y has an F (1) -point. Furthermore, we may assume that F (1) is linearly\nker(\u03c1f,\u03bb )\ndisjoint from Q\nover Q. Note that an F (1) -point of Y corresponds to an\n(1)\nF L-point of XW .\nWe now make a similar modification to the proof of Theorem 3.1 of [HSBT09],\nreplacing the schemes TWi over F with ResLF/F TWi . We conclude that there is a\nfinite Galois totally real extension F \u2032 /E in which s is unramified, which is linearly\n\nker(\u03c1\n\n)\n\nf,\u03bb\ndisjoint from Q\nover Q, such that for any n \u2208 N , Symn\u22121 A is automorphic\n\u2032\nover F L of weight 0 and type {Spn (1)}{wq } . Since the extension F \u2032 L/F \u2032 is solvable,\nit follows from solvable base change (e.g. Lemma 1.3 of [BLGHT09]) that in fact for\nany n \u2208 N , Symn\u22121 A is automorphic over F \u2032 of weight 0 and type {Spn (1)}{wq } ,\nas required.\n\u0003\n\n\u22121\n\nWe may now twist \u03c1 by \u03b8 in order to deduce results about \u03c1f,\u03bb . Let N and \u03bb\nbe as in the statement of Theorem 4.1. Fix an embedding N\u03bb\u2032 \u0592\u2192 Ql .

This is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 4.3. The only part that\nneeds to be checked is the assertion about the form of \u03c0n,x for x|l when k > 2.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that 2 \u2208 N . Note firstly that any\nprincipal series representation of the given form is irreducible, so that we need only\ncheck that\nn\nM\n\u03c9 (i\u22121)(2\u2212k) \u03b1i ,\n\u03b9\u22121 rec(\u03c0n,x ) =\ni=1\n\n\u0001\nwhere \u03b1i is an unramified character with vl (\u03b1i (l)) = [Fx\u2032 : Ql ] i \u2212 1 + 1\u2212n\n. By\n2\nDefinition 4.2 and Theorem 4.3 we see that rec(\u03c0n,x ) = Symn\u22121 rec(\u03c02,x ), so it suffices to establish the result in the case n = 2, or rather (because of the compatibility\nof rec with twisting) it suffices to check the corresponding result for WDv (A, i) at\nplaces v|l. This is now an immediate consequence of local-global compaitibility,\nand follows at once from, for example, Lemma B.4.1 of [CDT99], together with\nthe computations of the Weil-Deligne representations associated to characters in\nsection B.2 of loc. cit.\n\u0003\n5. Changing weight\n5.1. We now explain how to deduce from the results of the previous section that\nSymn \u03c1f,\u03bb is potentially automorphic of the correct weight (that is, the weight of the\nconjectural automorphic representation corresponding to Symn \u03c1f,\u03bb ), rather than\npotentially automorphic of weight 0. We accomplish this as a basic consequence of\nHida theory; note that we simply need a congruence, rather than a result about\nfamilies, and the result follows from a straightforward combinatorial argument.\nThis result is certainly known to the experts, but as we have been unable to find a\nreference which provides the precise result we need, we present a proof in the spirit\nof the arguments of [Tay88].\n5.2. For each n-tuple of integers a = (a1 , . . . , an ) with a1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 an there is an\nirreducible representation of the algebraic group GLn defined over Ql , with highest\nweight (with respect to the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular matrices) given by\ndiag(t1 , . . . , tn ) 7\u2192\n\nn\nY\n\ntai i .\n\ni=1\n\nWe will need an explicit model of this representation, for which we follow section 2\nof [Che04].\nLet K be an algebraic extension of Ql , N the subgroup of GLn (K) consisting of upper triangular unipotent matrices, N the subgroup of lower triangular\nunipotent matrices, and T the subgroup of diagonal matrices. Let R := K[GLn ] =\nK[{Xi,j }1\u2264i,j\u2264n , det(Xi,j )\u22121 ]. We have commuting natural actions of GLn (K) on R\n\n\f14\n\nTOBY GEE\n\nby left and right multiplication. For an element g \u2208 GLn (K) we denote these actions\nby gl and gr respectively, so that if we let M denote the matrix (Xi,j )i,j \u2208 Mn (R),\nwe have\n(gl .X)i,j = g \u22121 M\nand\n(gr .X)i,j = M g.\nn\nIf (t1 , . . . , tn ) \u2208 Z , we say that an element f \u2208 R is of left weight t (respectively\nof right weight t) if for all d \u2208 T we have dl f = t\u22121 (d)f (respectively dr f = t(d)f )\nwhere\nn\nY\nxtii .\nt(diag(x1 , . . . , xn )) =\ni=1\n\nFor each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and each i-tuple j = (j1 , . . . , ji ), 1 \u2264 j1 < * * * < ji \u2264 n, we\nlet Yi,j be the minor of order i of M obtained by taking the entries from the first\ni rows and columns j1 ,. . . ,ji . Let RN denote the subalgebra of R of elements fixed\nby the gl -action of N ; it is easy to check that Yi,j \u2208 RN . Because T normalises N\nit acts on RN on the left, and we let RtN be the sub K-vector space of elements of\nleft weight t; this has a natural action of GLn (K) induced by gr .\nProposition 5.1. Suppose that t1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 tn . Then RtN is a model of the irreducible algebraic representation of GLn (K) of highest weight t. Furthermore, it\nis generated as a K-vector space by the monomials in Yi,j of left weight t, and a\nhighest weight vector is given by the unique monomial in Yi,j of left and right weight\nt.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 2.2.1 of [Che04].\n\n\u0003\n\nAssume that in fact t1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 tn \u2265 0, and let Xt denote the free OK -module\nwith basis the monomials in Yi,j of left weight t. By Proposition 5.1, Xt is a\nGLn (OK )-stable lattice in RtN . Let T + be the submonoid of T consisting of elements\nof the form\ndiag(lb1 , . . . , lbn )\nwith b1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 bn \u2265 0; then Xt is certainly also stable under the action of T + .\nLet \u03b1 = diag(lb1 , . . . , lbn ) \u2208 T + . We wish to determine the action of \u03b1 on Xt .\nPn\n\nLemma 5.2. If Y \u2208 Xt is a monomialPin the Yi,j , then \u03b1(Y ) \u2282 l i=1 bi tn+1\u2212i Xt . If\nn\nin fact b1 > * * * > bn then \u03b1(Y ) \u2282 l1+ i=1 bi tn+1\u2212i Xt unless Y is the unique lowest\nweight vector.\nPn\n\nProof. If Y has (right) weight (v1 , . . . , vn ), then \u03b1(Y ) = l i=1 bi vi Y . The unique\nlowest weight vector has weight (tn , . . . , t1 ), so it suffices to prove that for any other\nPn\nY of weight (v1 , . . . , vn ) which occurs in RtN , the quantity i=1 bi vi is at least as\nlarge, and is strictly greater if b1 > * * * > bn . However, by standard weight theory\nwe know that we may obtain (v1 , . . . , vn ) from (tn , . . . , t1 ) by successively adding\nvectors of the form (0, . . . , 1, 0 . . . , 0, \u22121, 0, . . . , 0), and it is clear that the addition\nof such a vector does not decrease the sum, and in fact increases it if b1 > * * * > bn ,\nas required.\n\u0003\nWe define a new action of T + on Xt , which\nPn we denote by *twist , by multiplying the\nnatural action of diag(lb1 , . . . , lbn ) by l\u2212 i=1 bi tn+1\u2212i ; this is legitimate by Lemma\n5.2.\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n15\n\n\u223c\n\n5.3.

We transfer to a\nunitary group, following section 3.3 of [CHT08].

Let c denote the nontrivial\nlinearly disjoint from Q\nelement of Gal(M/F ). Let Sl denote the places of F dividing l, and let S\u0303l denote\na set of places of M dividing l such that the natural map S\u0303l \u2192 Sl is a bijection. If\nv|l is a place of F then we write \u1e7d for the corresponding place in S\u0303l .\n\u00d7\nLemma 5.3.

By Lemma 4.1.1 of [CHT08] (or more properly its proof, which shows that\nthe character produced may be arranged to have finite order) there is a finite\n\u00d7\norder character \u03c8 : M \u00d7 \\A\u00d7\nsuch that for each v \u2208 Sl , \u03c8|M\u1e7d \u00d7 = 1 and\nM \u2192 C\n\u03c8|Mc\u1e7d \u00d7 = \u03c7|Fv\u00d7 , and such that \u03c8 is unramified at each place in S(B).

More generally, let T(U ) denote the polyno(j)\nmial ring over O in the formal variables Tw and (Twn )\u22121 , which we may think of\nas acting on Sa,\u03c7 (U, A) via the obvious map T(U ) \u2192 Ta,\u03c7 (U, A).\nWe also wish to consider the Hecke operator Ul = [U uU ], where u \u2208 Tl+ has\nuv = diag(ln\u22121 , . . . , l, 1) for each v|l. As usual, we can define a Hida idempotent\nel = lim Uln! ,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich has the property that Ul is invertible on el Sa,\u03c7 (U, O) and is topologically\nnilpotent on (1 \u2212 el )Sa,\u03c7 (U, O). We write\nord\nSa,\u03c7\n(U, A) := el Sa,\u03c7 (U, A).\n\nLet a \u2208 (Zn )Hom(M,K) be a weight, and let \u03c7a = \u2297v|l \u03c7a,v , where\n\u03c7a,v : Uv /Uv\u2032 \u223c\n=\nQ Q\n\u00d7 n\n\u00d7\n((OMv /mMv ) ) \u2192 O is given by the character (x1 , . . . , xn ) 7\u2192 \u03c4 i \u03c4 (x\u0303i )a\u1e7d,n+1\u2212i ,\nwhere x\u0303i is the Teichm\u00fcller lift of xi , and the product is over the embeddings \u03c4 \u2208 I \u0303l\nwhich give rise to v.\nThe main lemma we require is the following.\nLemma 5.4. Let a be a weight. Then there is a T(U )-equivariant isomorphism\nord\nord\n(U, k).\nSa,\u03c7\n(U, k) \u2192 S0,\u03c7\u03c7\na\n\nProof. Note firstly that there is a natural projection map j from Ya,\u03c7 to the Omodule Q\ngiven by the tensor product Za,\u03c7 of the lowest weight vectors. This is a\nmap of v|l Uv -modules, and by Lemma 5.2 we see that j induces an isomorphism\nu * twist Ya,\u03c7 \u2297O k \u2192 u * twist Za,\u03c7 \u2297O k.\n\nNote also that by definition we have an isomorphism of hU, Tl+i-modules Za,\u03c7 \u2192\nY0,\u03c7\u03c7a . It thus suffices to prove that the induced map\nord\nord\n(U, k))\nj : Sa,\u03c7\n(U, k) \u2192 S ord (U, Za,\u03c7 \u2297O k) (= S0,\u03c7\u03c7\na\n\nis an isomorphism.\nWe claim that there is a diagram\nj\n\nu*twist\n\n/ S(U, Za,\u03c7 \u2297O k)\nSa,\u03c7 (U, k)\nhQQQ\nQQQ\nQQ\ncor QQQQ\nQ\nSa,\u03c7 (U \u2229 uU u\u22121 , k) o\n\n/ S(U \u2229 uU u\u22121 , u * twist Za,\u03c7 \u2297O k)\nj \u22121\n\ni\n\n\u000f\n\nS(U \u2229 uU u\u22121 , u *twist Ya,\u03c7 \u2297O k)\n\nsuch that the maps\nand\n\ncor \u25e6i \u25e6 j \u22121 \u25e6 u * twist \u25e6 j : Sa,\u03c7 (U, k) \u2192 Sa,\u03c7 (U, k)\n\nj \u25e6 cor \u25e6i \u25e6 j \u22121 \u25e6 u * twist : S(U, Za,\u03c7 \u2297O k) \u2192 S(U, Za,\u03c7 \u2297O k)\nord\nare both given by Ul . Since Ul is an isomorphism on Sa,\u03c7\n(U, k), the result will\nfollow.\nIn fact, the construction of the diagram is rather straightforward. The maps\nj, j \u22121 are just the natural maps on the coefficients (note that both are maps of\nU -modules). The map u * twist is given by\n(u * twist f )(h) = u *twist f (hu).\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n19\n\nThe map i is given by the inclusion of U -modules u * twist Ya,\u03c7 \u2297O k \u0592\u2192 Ya,\u03c7 \u2297O k.\nFinally, the map cor is defined in the following fashion. We may write\na\nU=\nui (U \u2229 uU u\u22121 ),\nand we define\n\n(cor f )(h) =\n\nX\n\nui f (hui ).\n\nThe claims regarding the compositions of these maps follow immediately from\nthe observation that\na\nU uU =\nui uU.\n\u0003\n\n5.5. We now recall some results on tamely ramified principal series representations\nof GLn from [Roc98]. Let L be a finite extension of Qp for some p, and let \u03c0L\nbe an irreducible smooth complex representation of GLn (L). Let I denote the\nIwahori subgroup of GLn (OL ) consisting of matrices which are upper-triangular\nmod mL , and let I1 denote its Sylow pro-l subgroup. Let l be the residue field\nof L, and let \u031fL denote a uniformiser of L. Then there is a natural isomorphism\nI/I1 \u223c\n= (l\u00d7 )n . If \u03c7 = (\u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n ) : (l\u00d7 )n \u2192 C\u00d7 is a character, then we let\nI,\u03c7\n\u03c0L denote the space of vectors in \u03c0L which are fixed by I1 and transform by \u03c7\nI,\u03c7\nunder the action of I/I1 . The space \u03c0L\nhas a natural action of the Hecke algebra\n\u22121\nH(I, \u03c7) of compactly supported \u03c7 -spherical functions on GLn (L). We consider\nthe commutative subalgebra T(I, \u03c7) of H(I, \u03c7) generated by double cosets [I\u03b1I]\nb1\nbn\nwhere \u03b1 = diag(\u031fL\n, . . . , \u031fL\n) with b1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 bn \u2265 0.\nI,\u03c7\nI,\u03c7\u0304\n\u00d7 n\n\u00d7\nIf \u03c7 : (OL ) \u2192 C is tamely ramified, then we let \u03c0L\ndenote \u03c0L\n, where \u03c7\u0304 is\nthe character (l\u00d7 )n \u2192 C\u00d7 determined by \u03c7.

The first two parts follow from Lemma 3.1.6 of [CHT08] and its proof. All\nthree parts follow at once from Theorem 7.7 and Remark 7.8 of [Roc98] (which\nare valid for GLn without any restrictions on L - see the proof of Lemma 3.1.6\nof [CHT08]), together with the standard calculation of the Jacquet module of a\nprincipal series representation, for which see for example Theorem 6.3.5 of [Cas95]\n\n\f20\n\nTOBY GEE\n1/2\n\n(although note that there is a missing factor of \u03b4 1/2 (or rather \u03b4\u03a9 in the notation\nof loc. cit.) in the formula given there).\n\u0003\nQ\n5.6. Keep our running assumptions on \u03c0. Suppose that U = v Uv is a sufficiently\nsmall subgroup of G(AF ). Assume further that U has been chosen such that if\nv\u2208\n/ S(B), v = wwc splits completely in M , and Uv is a maximal compact subgroup\nof G(Fv ), then \u03c0w is unramified. Recall that we have fixed an isomorphism \u03b9 :\n\u223c\nQl \u2212\u2192 C. There is a maximal ideal m\u03b9,\u03c0 of T(U ) determined by \u03c0 in the following\n(i)\nfashion. For each place v = wwc as above the Hecke operators Tw act via scalars\nGLn (OMw )\n\u03b1w,i on (\u03c0w )\n. The \u03b1w,i are all algebraic integers, so that \u03b9\u22121 (\u03b1w,i ) \u2208 O.\n(i)\nThen m\u03b9,\u03c0 is the maximal ideal of T(U ) containing all the Tw \u2212 \u03b9\u22121 (\u03b1w,i ). Let\nn Hom(M,K)\n\u03c3k \u2208 (Z )\nbe the weight determined by (\u03c3k )\u03c4,i = (k \u2212 2)(n \u2212 i) for each\n\u03c4 \u2208 I \u0303l .\nLemma 5.6. Suppose that \u03c0 is a RACSDC representation of GLn (AM ) of weight\n0 and type {Spn (1)}S(B) . Suppose that for each place x \u2208 S\u0303l , \u03c0x is a principal\nGLn (Mx )\n(i\u22121)(2\u2212k)\n(\u03c7x,1 , . . . , \u03c7x,n ) with \u03b9\u22121 \u03c7x,i \u25e6 Art\u22121\n. Then\nseries n-IndBn (M\nFx |Ix = \u03c9\nx)\nthere is a sufficiently small compact open subgroupQU of G(AF ) such that U satisfies the requirements above (in particular, U = v Uv where Uv is an Iwahori\nsubgroup of GLn (Fv ) for each v|l) and S0,\u03c7\u03c3k (U, O)m\u03b9,\u03c0 6= 0. If we assume further\u0001\nmore that vl (\u03b9\u22121 \u03c7x,i (l)) = [Mx : Ql ] i \u2212 1 + 1\u2212n\nfor all i (and all x \u2208 S\u0303l ) then\n2\nord\n=\n6\n0.\n(U,\nO)\nS0,\u03c7\nm\n\u03b9,\u03c0\n\u03c3\nk\n\nProof. This is a consequence of Proposition 3.3.2 of [CHT08]. The only issues are\nat places dividing l and places in S(B). For the latter, it is enough to note that\nunder the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence, Spn (1) corresponds to the trivial\nrepresentation. For the first part, we also need to check that at each place x \u2208 S\u0303l ,\n\u03c0xIx ,\u03c7x 6= 0, where Ix is the standard Iwahori subgroup of GLn (Mx ), and \u03c7x =\n(\u03c7x,1 , . . . , \u03c7x,n ). This follows at once from Proposition 5.5.\nFor the second part, we must check in addition that if the Hecke operator [Ix ux Ix ]\n(where ux = diag(ln\u22121 , . . . , 1)) acts via the scalar \u03b1x on \u03c0xIx ,\u03c7x , then \u03b9\u22121 (\u03b1x ) is an\nl-adic unit. This is straightforward; by Proposition 5.5(3), \u03b1x = \u03c7x (u)\u03b4 \u22121/2 (u).\nThus\nvl (\u03b9\u22121 (\u03b1x )) = vl (\u03b9\u22121 (\u03c7x (u)\u03b4 \u22121/2 (u)))\n=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n(n \u2212 i)vl (\u03b9\u22121 \u03c7x,i (l)) +\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n(n \u2212 i)vl ((l\u2212[Mx :Ql ] )\u2212(n+1\u22122i)/2) )\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\nX\n1\u2212n\n[Mx : Ql ](n \u2212 i)(n + 1 \u2212 2i)/2\n)+\n(n \u2212 i)([Mx : Ql ] i \u2212 1 +\n=\n2\ni=1\ni=1\nn\nX\n\nn\n\n[Mx : Ql ] X\n=\n(n \u2212 i)((2i \u2212 1 \u2212 n) + (n + 1 \u2212 2i))\n2\ni=1\n= 0,\nas required.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.7. Keep (all) the assumptions of Lemma 5.6.

This is essentially a consequence of Lemma 5.6, Lemma 5.4, and Proposition\n5.5, together with Proposition 3.3.2 of [CHT08]. Indeed, Lemma 5.4 and Lemma\n5.6 show that S\u03c3ord\n(U, O)m\u03b9,\u03c0 6= 0, which by Proposition 5.5(1) and Proposition\nk ,1\n3.3.2 of [CHT08] gives us a \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 satisfying all the properties we claim, except that we\nonly know that for each x|l, \u03c0x\u2032\u2032 is a subquotient of an unramified principal series\nrepresentation. We claim that this unramified principal series is irreducible, so that\n\u03c0x\u2032\u2032 is unramified. To see this, note that the fact that we know that S\u03c3ord\n(U, O)m\u03b9,\u03c0 6=\nk ,1\n0 (rather than merely S\u03c3k ,1 (U, O)m\u03b9,\u03c0 6= 0) means that we can choose \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 so that\nfor each x \u2208 S\u0303l , \u03c0x\u2032\u2032 is a subquotient of an unramified principal series representation\nGLn (Mx )\n(\u03c7x,1 , . . . , \u03c7x,n ) with\nn-IndBn (M\nx)\nvl (\u03b9\u22121 \u03c7x,i (l)) = [Mx : Ql ] ((i \u2212 1)(k \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 n)/2)\n(this follows from the comparison of the Hecke actions on (\u03c0x\u2032\u2032 )Ix and S\u03c3k ,1 (U, O),\nnoting that the latter action is defined in terms of *twist ). Now, if the principal series\nGLn (Mx )\n(\u03c7x,1 , . . . , \u03c7x,n ) were reducible, there would be i, j with \u03c7x,i = \u03c7x,j |*|,\nn-IndBn (M\nx)\nso that \u03c7x,i (l)l[Mx :Ql ] = \u03c7x,j (l), which is a contradiction because k > 2.

Then from\nLemma 4.3.2 of [CHT08] we see that for each F \u2032 with F/F \u2032 soluble, Symn\u22121 \u03c1f,\u03bb |Gal(F /F \u2032 )\nis automorphic, as required.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 6.2. Suppose that f is a cuspidal newform of level \u03931 (N ) and weight\nk = 2 or 3. Suppose that f is potentially Steinberg at q. Let N be a finite set of\neven positive integers. Then there is a Galois totally real field F such that for any\nn \u2208 N and any subfield F \u2032 \u2282 F with F/F \u2032 soluble, Symn\u22121 f is automorphic over\nF \u2032.\nProof. Let \u03b8 be a Dirichlet character such that f \u2032 = f \u2297 \u03b8 is Steinberg at q. The\nresult then follows from Theorem 6.1 applied to f \u2032 .\n\u0003\n\n\f24\n\nTOBY GEE\n\n7. The Sato-Tate Conjecture\n7.1. Let f be a cuspidal newform of level \u03931 (N ), nebentypus \u03c7f , and weight k \u2265 2.\nSuppose that \u03c7f has order m, so that the image of \u03c7f is precisely the group \u03bcm\nof m-th roots of unity. Let U (2)m be the subgroup of U (2) consisting of matrices\nwith determinant in \u03bcm . For each prime l \u2224 N , if we write\nX 2 \u2212 al X + lk\u22121 \u03c7f (l) = (X \u2212 \u03b1l l(k\u22121)/2 )(X \u2212 \u03b2l l(k\u22121)/2 )\nthen (by the Ramanujan conjecture) the matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b1l 0\n0 \u03b2l\ndefines a conjugacy class xf,l in U (2)m . A natural generalisation of the Sato-Tate\nconjecture is\nConjecture 7.1. If f is not of CM type, then the conjugacy classes xf,l are equidistributed with respect to the Haar measure on U (2)m (normalised so that U (2)m has\nmeasure 1).\nThe group U (2)m is compact, and its irreducible representations are given by\ndeta \u2297 Symb C2 for 0 \u2264 a < m and b \u2265 0. By the corollary to Theorem 2 of\nsection I.A.2 of [Ser68] (noting the different normalisations of L-functions in force\nthere), Conjecture 7.1 follows if one knows that for each b \u2265 1, the functions\nL(\u03c7af \u2297 Symb f, s) are holomorphic and non-zero for Rs \u2265 1 + b(k \u2212 1)/2 (the\nrequired results for b = 0 are classical).\nTheorem 7.2. Suppose that f is a cuspidal newform of level \u03931 (N ), character\n\u03c7f , and weight k = 2 or 3. Suppose that \u03c7f has order m. Suppose also that f is\npotentially Steinberg at q for some prime q. Then for all integers 0 \u2264 a < m, b \u2265 1\nthe function L(\u03c7af \u2297 Symb f, s) has meromorphic continuation to the whole complex\nplane, satisfies the expected functional equation, and is holomorphic and nonzero\nin Rs \u2265 1 + b(k \u2212 1)/2.\nProof. The argument is very similar to the proof of Theorem 4.2 of [HSBT09]. We\nargue by induction on b; suppose that b is odd, and the result is known for all\n1 \u2264 b\u2032 < b. We will deduce the result for b and for b + 1 simultaneously. Apply\nCorollary 6.2 with N = {2, b + 1}. Let F be as in the conclusion of Corollary 6.2.\nBy Brauer's theorem, we may write\nGal(F/Q)\n\n1 = \u03a3j aj IndGal(F/Fj ) \u03c7j\nwhere F \u2283 Fj with F/Fj soluble, \u03c7j a character Gal(F/Fj ) \u2192 C\u00d7 , and aj \u2208 Z.\nThen for each j, Symb f is automorphic over Fj , corresponding to an RAESDC representation \u03c0j of GLb+1 (AFj ). In addition, f is automorphic over Fj , corresponding\nto an RAESDC representation \u03c3j of GL2 (AFj ).\nThen we have\nY\nL(\u03c0j \u2297 (\u03c7j \u25e6 ArtFj ) \u2297 (\u03c7af \u25e6 NFj /Q ), s)aj ,\nL(\u03c7af \u2297 Symb f, s) =\nj\n\nL(\u03c7af \u2297 Sym2 f, s) =\n\nY\nj\n\nL((Sym2 \u03c3j ) \u2297 (\u03c7j \u25e6 ArtFj ) \u2297 (\u03c7af \u25e6 NFj /Q ), s)aj ,\n\n\fTHE SATO-TATE CONJECTURE FOR MODULAR FORMS OF WEIGHT 3\n\n25\n\nand\nL(\u03c7af \u2297Symb+1 f, s)L(\u03c7a+1\n\u2297Symb\u22121 f, s\u2212k+1) =\nf\n\nY\nj\n\nL((\u03c0j \u2297(\u03c7j \u25e6ArtFj )\u2297(\u03c7af \u25e6NFj /Q ))\u00d7\u03c3j , s+b(k\u22121)/2)aj .\n\nThe result then follows from the main results of [CPS04] and [GJ78] (in the case\nb = 1) together with Theorem 5.1 of [Sha81].\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.3. Suppose that f is a cuspidal newform of level \u03931 (N ) and weight\nk = 2 or 3. Suppose also that f is potentially Steinberg at q for some prime q.\nThen Conjecture 7.1 holds for f .\nFinally, we note that one can make this result more concrete, as one can easily explicitly determine the Haar measure on U (2)m from that of its finite index\nsubgroup SU (2). One finds that (as already follows from Dirchlet's theorem) the\nclasses xf,l are equidistributed by determinant, and that furthermore the classes\nwith fixed determinant are equidistributed with respect to the natural analogue of\nthe usual Sato-Tate measure. That is, suppose that \u03b6 \u2208 \u03bcm , and fix a square root\n\u03b6 1/2 of \u03b6. Then any conjugacy class xf,l in U (2)m with determinant \u03b6 contains a\nrepresentative of the form\n\u0012 1/2 i\u03b8\n\u0013\n\u03b6 e l\n0\n0\n\u03b6 1/2 e\u2212i\u03b8l\nwith \u03b8l \u2208 [0, \u03c0], and the \u03b8l are equidistributed with respect to the measure\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nsin2 \u03b8d\u03b8.\n\nReferences\n[BLGHT09] Tom Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor, A family\nof Calabi-Yau varieties and potential automorphy II, Preprint, 2009.\n[Cas95]\nBill Casselman, Introduction to the theory of admissible representations of p-adic\nreductive groups, 1995.\n[CDT99]\nBrian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor, Modularity of certain potentially\nBarsotti-Tate Galois representations, J.
