When equipped with an iodine\nabsorption cell or thorium-argon calibration source, echelle spectrographs can measure the\nradial velocity (RV) of a star with a precision of \u223c 1 m/s (Bouchy et al. 2009; Howard et al.\n2009). This approach to stellar velocimetry has proven highly successful in the hunt for\nexoplanets and other low-mass, low-luminosity companions orbiting bright stars.\nHowever, the application of these \"PRV\" (precision radial velocity) techniques to\nbinary stars has been more limited. Models of stellar structure and evolution require\naccurate measurement of stellar masses for validation and refinement, and binary star\nsystems are among the best celestial laboratories for making such measurements. Given the\nperiod P , radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 of the two components, eccentricity e, and\ninclination angle i of a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) system, the masses of both\nstars can easily be derived. If the angular size of the semimajor axes of the orbit can also\nbe measured, using spatial or speckle interferometry, then the distance to the system can\nbe determined as well.\nWhen an SB2 target is observed with an iodine-absorption echelle, it becomes\nalgorithmically challenging to disentangle the three superposed spectra (two different stars\nplus the iodine absorption lines). Konacki (2005, 2009) has made notable progress towards\nsolving this challenge, and in conjunction with astrometric data from spatial interferometers,\nhis technique has yielded some very precise binary star masses (Muterspaugh et al. 2006),\nbut this approach has not yet been widely adopted.\nThorium-argon emission line lamps provide another means of precisely determining the\nwavelength scale for echelle spectra, and several groups have achieved excellent RV results\non spectroscopic binaries using Th-Ar calibration. Tomkin & Fekel (2006) report RMS\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nvelocity residuals of 0.11 km/s on two SB2 systems, a particularly notable accomplishment\ngiven that their spectrograph, the Sandiford Echelle (McCarthy et al. 1993), is mounted\nat the Cassegrain focus of the telescope, and is thus subject to a changing gravity vector.\nFekel et al. (2007) achieve a similar level of RV precision with a fiber-fed, bench-mounted\nechelle. The HERCULES instrument (Hearnshaw et al. 2002), a fiber-fed echelle mounted\ninside a vacuum chamber for greater RV stability, has achieved impressive RMS velocity\nresiduals of 14 to 56 m/s on binary targets (Ramm et al. 2004; Skuljan et al. 2004; Ramm\n2008).\nOur research group has been pursuing an alternative approach to stellar velocimetry,\ndeveloping a new instrument which provides meter-per-second RV accuracy without a\nsuperposed reference spectrum or vacuum enclosure. This instrument concept is known as\nthe Dispersed Fourier Transform Spectrograph, or dFTS. Our prototype device, dFTS1, is\ndescribed in detail by Hajian et al. (2007) (henceforth, \"Paper 1\"). Installed at the Clay\nCenter Observatory 0.6-meter telescope, dFTS1 demonstrated the viability of the concept,\nwith precision RV measurements of spectroscopic binary systems and exoplanet host stars.\nTo develop the dFTS concept further and undertake a comprehensive science program,\nwe designed and constructed a new device, called dFTS2, and deployed it at the Steward\nObservatory 2.3-meter Bok Telescope on Kitt Peak. In this paper, we describe the dFTS2\ninstrument and present results from our observing campaign, focusing on RV reference\nstars and single-lined spectroscopic binary stars (SB1s). Single-lined binaries are not as\nscientifically interesting as SB2s, because absolute stellar masses cannot be derived, but\nthe SB1s still serve as useful tests of our spectrograph performance. Orbital elements of\ndouble-lined systems will be discussed in a subsequent paper.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.\n\nOverview of dFTS concept\n\nThe dFTS concept and its underlying mathematical theory are treated in detail in\nPaper 1, but in the following section we review the some of the key aspects of the design.\nA traditional Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS) consists of a Michelson\ninterferometer with one retroreflector mounted on a translation stage (Figure 1, left). An\ninput source is collimated and then divided into two equal parts by a beamsplitter cube\n(BSCA). Each beam travels down one \"arm\" of the interferometer, hits a corner-cube\nretroreflector (RR1 or RR2), and returns to a second beamsplitter (BSCB), where the\ntwo beams combine interferometrically. Depending on the wavelength of the light and the\noptical path difference (OPD) or \"delay\" between the two arms, the outputs from BSCB\nwill exhibit constructive or destructive interference. (In the figure, only one output is\nshown; a complementary output exits the top face of BSCB.)\nAs RR2 is moved on its translation stage, the delay changes, and the intensity of the\ninterferometer output changes as well. Normally, the retroreflector stage is scanned or\nstepped through a series of different positions, and the output intensity at each delay is\nmeasured using a photosensitive detector (D1). The result is an interferogram (Figure 1,\nbottom right), which is the Fourier transform of the spectral energy distribution of the\ninput source (Figure 1, top right). By performing a Fourier inversion of the interferogram,\nthe source spectrum can be recovered. For a higher-resolution spectrum, the interferometer\nmerely needs to scan over a wider range of delay, and the wavelength scale of the spectrum\ncan be derived very accurately if the delay positions are measured with a metrology system.\nHowever, if the input source is broadband, as depicted in Figure 1, then the amplitude\nof a FTS's interferometric \"fringes\" (the oscillations of intensity as a function of delay)\ndrops off quickly as we move away from the central delay position (OPD = 0), because all\nthe different wavelengths quickly decorrelate. Small-amplitude fringes are still present, but\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nL1\n\ninput\n\nL2\n\nBSCA\n\nBSCB\nRR2\n\nD1\n\ntranslation stage motion\n\nRR1\n\nFig. 1.- Schematic of a conventional FTS using an offset Michelson interferometer configuration (left), with a broadband input spectrum (top right) and resulting interferogram\n(bottom right).\n\nthey become very difficult to detect given measurement noise. Fine details of the input\nspectrum, which are encoded in the high-delay fringes, are thus lost.\nTo boost the fringe contrast, a narrowband filter (NBF) can be added to a FTS,\nthereby restricting the input bandpass (Figure 2). The interferometer output remains\ncoherent over a wider range of delays, with stronger fringes at large delay, so that details\nof the spectrum can be measured. However, all of the light outside of the filter bandpass\nis discarded. For some astronomical applications, where only a narrow spectral region is of\ninterest, this is acceptable, but for broadband spectroscopy, the overall system efficiency is\nunacceptably low. Traditional FTS devices have therefore seen only limited use in stellar\nastronomy.\nThe dFTS concept addresses this limitation of the traditional FTS design. Figure\n3 depicts a dFTS configuration in schematic form. The narrowband filter has been\nreplaced by a dispersive grating (G), and the dispersed spectrum is focused onto an array\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nBSCA\n\nL1\n\ninput\n\nBSCB\n\nL2\n\nD1\n\nRR2\nNBF\ntranslation stage motion\n\nRR1\n\nFig. 2.- Schematic of a conventional FTS with a narrowband filter (left). The narrowed\nspectral bandpass (top right) results in a broader central fringe packet in the interferogram\n(bottom right), such that the fringes at large delay are stronger than in Figure 1.\n\ndetector (CCD). The broadband output beam from the interferometer is thus divided into\nmany separate spectral channels (Figure 3, top right), each of them covering just a small\nsubsection of the initial bandpass. The figure shows only six channels, but in an actual\ndFTS instrument, there would be thousands of channels, one for each CCD pixel along the\ndispersion dimension. Because the channels are narrowband, their fringe patterns (Figure 3,\nbottom right) span a wide range of delays, and we can derive the fine details of the spectrum\nfrom the high-OPD fringes without sacrificing spectral coverage. In essence, the grating\nacts as a multiplexer, converting a single broadband FTS into several thousand narrowband\nFTSs, all operating in parallel and sharing the same interferometer optics. Each channel\ninterferogram transforms into a narrowband spectrum. Merging the narrowband spectra\nproduces a high-resolution broadband spectrum.\nAn additional advantage of narrowband output channels is that the interferogram can\nbe sampled much more coarsely. The Nyquist theorem requires that, in order to avoid\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nL1\n\ninput\n\nBSCA\n\nBSCB\nG\nL2\n\nRR2\ntranslation stage motion\n\nCCD\nRR1\n\nFig. 3.- Schematic of a dispersed FTS (left). The Michelson interferometer is followed by\na grating spectrograph, which acts as a multiplexer. Each pixel along the CCDs dispersion\naxis acts as the detector for a separate spectral channel (top right). Because the individual channels are narrowband, their interferograms (bottom right) have wide central fringe\npackets and stronger fringes at large delay than in the broadband case.\n\naliasing, the fringes must be sampled with a delay step size \u2206x which is less than or equal\nto 1/(2\u2206s), where \u2206s is the bandwidth in wavenumbers. With narrowband channels,\ntherefore, we can cover a wide range of delays (and thus derive a high-resolution spectrum)\nwith relatively few delay positions. This \"sparse-sampling\" strategy is treated in more\ndetail in the Appendices of Paper 1.\nTwo additional strengths of the dFTS concept should be noted. First, the instrumental\nbroadening function (or line spread function) can be determined a priori from the delay\nsampling function, so that the true shape of the stellar absorption line profiles can be\nderived in a straightforward fashion. Second, because the high-resolution information in\nthe source spectrum is extracted by the interferometer, the dispersive part of the dFTS\ndoes not have to be as powerful as in an echelle (e.g. R = 5,000 instead of R = 50,000), so\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe collimated beam diameter at the disperser can be considerably smaller. This issue is\nparticularly relevant for instruments on 8\u201310 meter telescopes, where the instrument optics\ncan become exceedingly large and expensive. Smaller-diameter optics are also advantageous\nfor instruments in spacecraft, airborne platforms, and field-portable sensor packages.\n\n3.\n\nInstrument design and deployment\n3.1.\n\nDesign considerations\n\nThe dFTS1 prototype proved successful for validating the instrument concept and\ndemonstrating its capabilities for accurate measurement of stellar RVs, but in the course of\ncommissioning and operating dFTS1 we identified several potential improvements to the\noptical design and implementation. The design of dFTS2 was thus motivated by five main\ndrivers:\n1. Higher photon throughput.\n2. Higher spectral resolution RG of the dispersive backend, for narrower channel\nbandpasses and higher fringe contrast over the delay range.\n3. Good coupling to 2-meter telescope optics.\n4. Smaller physical size, for transportation to observing facilities.\n5. Utilization of optics and optomechanical components that were already in hand, or\ncould be acquired inexpensively, to fit within our budget constraints.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nFinal instrument design\n\nThe final configuration of dFTS2 is shown in Figure 4. The interior of the instrument's\nthermal enclosure measures approximately 100 cm \u00d7 70 cm, with a height of 30 cm. The\ninterferometer and laser metrology system are mounted on a larger optical breadboard (on\nthe left side of the photograph in Figure 4), while the dispersive backend is placed on a\nsmaller separate breadboard (on the right side), so that vibrations from the mechancal\nshutter and CCD fans would not affect the interferometer.\nStarlight from the telescope enters the instrument via a multimode fiber (MMF). The\nbeam exiting the fiber is collimated by lens L1 and passes through an iris with 20 mm\naperture. It then encounters BSC1, the first of four polarizing beamsplitter cubes. BSC1\nis mounted at a 45\u25e6 angle from the plane of the breadboard, so the transmitted light is\ndiagonally (linearly) polarized. At BSC2 (which corresponds to BSCA in the prior figures),\nthe vertically-polarized component of the beam is reflected towards stationary retroreflector\nRR1, while the horizontally-polarized part transmits and goes to moving retroreflector\nRR2. For translating RR2, we use an Aerotech ANT-50L linear motor stage, instead of the\nParker Daedal MX-80 stage in dFTS1 (as described in Paper 1). The ANT-50L provides\nbetter stability while holding at a fixed delay position; the RMS jitter in optical delay\nposition is typically less than 20 nm.\nAfter retroreflection, the beams meet at BSC3 (equivalent to BSCB), where the\nvertically-polarized beam is again reflected and the horizontally-polarized beam is\ntransmitted, such that the beams are once more coincident and parallel. Because of their\northogonal polarizations, however, they cannot combine interferometrically until they\nencounter BSC4, which is mounted at 45\u25e6 like BSC1 and thus \"mixes\" the two polarizations\ntogether. The two outputs from BSC4 (one transmitted, one reflected) are each focused by\na lens L2, are steered by a series of fold mirrors (FM), and are passed through the shutter\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nREF\nCCD\nRR2\n\nUNK\nBSC3\nRR1\n\nS\n\nCL\n\nPB\n\nFSL\n\nN\n\nBSC2\nL4\nBSC4\nBSC1\n\nS\nL2\n\nL1\nFI\n\nWC\n\nSF\nG\nFM\n\nAOMs\n\nL3\n\nWC\n\nMMF\n\nFig. 4.- Photograph and layout schematic of the final dFTS2 design.

The light that is reflected from\nBSC1 (the \"C-beam\") is focused by a third L2 lens, and also enters the backend, where it\nprovides a non-interferometric flux reference.\nWe had originally placed a set of optical fiber spot-to-line bundles just prior to the\nshutter, in order to \"slice\" the output beams from the interferometer, and thus achieve\nhigher grating resolution RG in the dispersive backend. We used this fiber arrangement\nfor the first observing run but found that it was very inefficient, so we replaced it with an\narrangement of small mirrors before the second observing run.\nThe three diverging beams are collimated by achromat L3 and then dispersed by\ngrating G, a Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. volume-phase holographic grating with 1,800\nlines/mm. For the camera lens (CL), one of us (Murison) designed a custom f/3.6 camera\nlens with 180 mm focal length, using only off-the-shelf singlets and achromats. When\ninstalled prior to the second observing run, this custom lens provided a vast improvement in\nphoton efficiency over the Nikon SLR lens that we had been using previously. The camera\nlens is bolted to an Apogee U-1107 CCD, with a 2048 \u00d7 122 array of 12\u03bcm \u00d7 12\u03bcm pixels.\nThe total instrument bandpass spans 470 nm to 540 nm.\nAs with dFTS1, a laser metrology system continuously monitors the optical delay\nduring a data acquisition scan, so that each delay position is precisely and unambiguously\nknown. A Melles-Griot 05-STP-901 frequency-stabilized laser (FSL) acts as the wavelength\nreference. The laser beam passes through a Faraday isolator (to suppress backscatter) and\nis then divided into horizontally- and vertically-polarized components by a small polarizing\nBSC. These beams are frequency-shifted by two acousto-optic modulators (AOMs), which\nare driven at two slightly different frequencies, creating an 11 kHz beat frequency between\nthe horizontal and vertical polarizations. The two polarizations are recombined by a second\nsmall BSC, and then sent through a spatial filter (SF) to produce a flat and uniform\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwavefront. Lens L4 collimates the metrology beam to a diameter of 20 mm, matching\nthe starlight beam size. A non-polarizing 50/50 beamsplitter (NPBS) sends half of the\nmetrology beam into the interferometer, while the other half goes to a \"reference\" metrology\ndetector (REF), where the horizontal and vertical components of the beam are mixed\ntogether with a linear polarizer, and the resulting 11 kHz sinusoidal interference signal\nis detected by a photodiode. The metrology beam enters the interferometer at BSC2,\nfollowing exactly the same path as the starlight beam until BSC3, where it exits and is\ncaptured by the \"unknown\" metrology detector unit (UNK), which also detects the 11 kHz\nsinusoidal signal. A change in the interferometer delay manifests as a phase shift between\nthe REF and UNK signals. This phase difference is measured and recorded, and then\nconverted into an absolute delay position in postprocessing.\nThe dFTS2 instrument is housed inside a thermal enclosure, with a temperature\nstabilization system that keeps the internal air temperature constant to \u00b10.05\u25e6 C. A Vaisala\nPTU-200 atmospheric monitoring unit measures the temperature, pressure, and humidity\nof the airmass in the immediate vicinity of the interferometer, so that we can correct\nour laser metrology data to account for changes in the index of refraction, which would\notherwise induce shifts of \u223c 20 m/s in the RV zero point of the instrument. Key optical\ncomponents are placed on tip-tilt mounts with New Focus \"Picomotor\" actuators, for\nremote adjustment, and critical beam alignment positions are viewed remotely with D-Link\nDCS-900 webcams (WC).\n\n3.3.\n\nTelescope guider box and fiber feed\n\nStarlight reaches the dFTS2 instrument via a multimode optical fiber from a customized\n\"guider box\" that bolts to the telescope's Cassegrain focus position. The f/9 converging\nbeam from the telescope's secondary mirror reflects from a SBIG AO-7 tip-tilt mirror and\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthen passes through a small achromat lens, which speeds up the beam to f/2.5. Just before\nencountering the input tip of the fiber, the beam passes through an uncoated pellicle (92%\ntransmission). The 50\u03bcm core of the fiber subtends 1.8 arcseconds on the sky. The light\nthat does not enter the fiber is reflected by the polished face of the fiber ferrule, and 8% of\nit bounces off the pellicle and is reimaged on to an Astrovid StellaCam III video camera,\nwhich provides an image for guiding. This video signal is digitized and monitored by a\ncustom software package, which adjusts the AO-7 tip-tilt mirror to keep the star image\ncentered on the fiber core.\nLight from calibration sources (such as an incandescent lamp or a hollow-cathode\nemission-line lamp) is sent to the guider box through a secondary optical fiber. The output\nfrom this fiber is reimaged onto the primary fiber input via a fold mirror which is inserted\ninto the telescope beam path, so that the calibration source reaches the main fiber from the\nsame direction and at the same f/ratio as starlight. This feature of dFTS2 ensures that the\ninstrument illumination pattern is the same for calibration and science exposures.\n\n3.4.\n\nDeployment and operation\n\nThe dFTS2 hardware was assembled at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington,\nD.C., and after a brief testing period was shipped to Steward Observatory's 2.3-meter Bok\ntelescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona. For the initial commissioning run, we installed the\ninstrument and support electronics in a storage room one floor below the telescope, but\nthis room was not air-conditioned, and the instrument was prone to overheating, so for\nsubsequent runs we moved dFTS2 to the control room next to the telescope. The thermal\nenvironment was more stable at this location, although the temperature stabilization\nsystem still had to contend with fluctuations of \u223c 4\u25e6 C in the ambient air temperature as\nthe room's A/C or heating system cycled.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nWe had eight observing runs on the Bok telescope with dFTS2, on the following dates\n(civil) : 27 Jun \u2013 04 Jul, 2007; 30 Sep \u2013 03 Oct, 2007; 27 Oct \u2013 31 Oct, 2007; 22 Jan \u2013 27\nJan, 2008; 22 Mar \u2013 24 Mar, 2008; 20 Apr \u2013 23 Apr, 2008; 16 May \u2013 20 May, 2008; and 17\nJun \u2013 21 Jun, 2008.\nInterferometric scans on stellar targets consisted of 500 delay step positions, with a\n0.25 to 4.0 second exposure at each position, depending on the star's brightness and the\natmospheric seeing and opacity.\n\n4.\n\nInstrument performance\n\n4.1.\n\nPhoton throughput\n\nTo test the real-world photon efficiency of the instrument, we measured the\nphotoelectron detection rate on our CCD while observing photometrically stable stars\nunder good seeing conditions, and compared those numbers to the expected photon\nflux as determined from the stars' published V magnitudes. We estimate the total\nsystem efficiency (including atmospheric opacity, telescope mirror reflectivity, fiber feed\ntransmission, instrument mirror reflectivity, and CCD quantum efficiency) to be 4.3%.\nThis figure represents a significant (6\u00d7) improvement over the 0.7% total efficiency we\nreported for dFTS1. The enhanced throughput performance of dFTS2 is due primarily to\nbetter coupling into the fiber in the telescope guider box, a simpler instrument layout with\nfewer fold mirror reflections, and the custom camera lens. In conjunction with the larger\ncollecting area of the Bok telescope, these upgrades have permitted us to achieve much\nbetter RV precision on fainter stars than with dFTS1.\nHowever, further improvements in photon throughput are certainly possible. The\n50\u03bcm core diameter of the optical fiber was not well-matched to the typical seeing disk size\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nat the Bok telescope; with a 100\u03bcm fiber and suitable modifications to the downstream\noptics, we might have achieved a 50\u201380% increase in the measured stellar flux. The optics\nin the dFTS2 instrument box also accumulated some visible dust over the course of our\nobserving campaign, despite our efforts to keep the system enclosed as much as possible\nduring assembly and disassembly. With future dFTSes permanently installed as facility\ninstruments, we anticipate being able to reach photon throughput efficiencies of 10 to 12%,\nsimilar to many echelle spectrographs.\n\n4.2.\n\nDispersive backend resolution\n\nDuring each night of observing, we collected an interferometric scan of a incandescent\nwhite light source, which let us measure the central wavelength and the bandwidth of\neach spectral channel on the CCD. These channel bandpass data are subsequently used in\nreconstructing the broadband high-resolution spectra of our stellar targets and measuring\ntheir RVs. We can also use these white-light scans to evaluate the performance of the\ndispersive backend system. We measure a spectral resolution RG > 4,700 over the entire\nspectral range of dFTS2, with a mean RG of approximately 4,950 and a peak of 5,150.\nThis resolution is nearly three times better than the RG \u2243 1,700 of dFTS1, which results\nin broader fringe packets, greater fringe visibility, and thus better SNR of the final\nhigh-resolution spectra.\n\n4.3.\n\nIntrinsic RV stability\n\nIn addition to the white-light scans, we also acquired at least six scans of a hollowcathode thorium-neon emission line lamp per night. (The only available thorium-argon\nlamp was not bright enough for reliable measurements.) By measuring the interferometric\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nfringe patterns of the \u223c 60 brightest emission lines, we were able to evaluate the intrinsic\nRV stability of the instrument. These calibration measurements also defined the RV zero\npoint for each night of an observing run; when the instrument was reassembled at the\nbeginning of each run, or realigned during a run, the alignment between the starlight and\nmetrology beams could have shifted slightly, creating a systematic offset in derived RV.\nFigure 5 shows the measured RVs of the thorium-neon source for 224 scans over the\ncourse of our observing program, from September 2007 to June 2008. On some nights,\nsuch as 2008-01-24 and 2008-04-22, the instrument was quite stable, with a \u03c3(RV) of 1.5\nm/s or better. On other nights, however, we see much greater variability, with \u03c3(RV) of\napproximately 10 m/s and peak-to-peak fluctuations as large as 20 m/s. The \"unstable\"\nnights seem to be due to temperature fluctuations of \u223c 0.2\u25e6 C of the optomechanical\nstructure of the instrument, induced by \u223c 5\u25e6 C changes of the ambient air temperature\nin the room housing the dFTS2 hardware. Even though the air temperature inside the\ndFTS2 enclosure is controlled to \u00b10.05\u25e6 C, the optical breadboard and optics mounts can\nget warmer or cooler and change their shape enough to induce a measurable RV shift. To\naccount for this error source, we apply an error of 10 m/s (added in quadrature) to the\nradial velocity error estimates for all our stellar observations, as well as adjusting the RV\nzero point on a night-by-night basis (see below). Future dFTS instruments will need to\nbe installed in more thermally stable environments to achieve their full RV measurement\npotential.\n\n5.\n\nData reduction and derivation of radial velocities\n\nReduction of the interferogram data from dFTS2 followed the same basic pathway as\nfor dFTS1 (see section 3.4 of Paper 1), with the addition of an intermediate step to correct\nfor a significant nonlinearity in the response of the U-1107 CCD. Photometric corrections\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Night-to-night radial velocity zero point of dFTS2, measured using a thorium-neon\nemission line lamp.\n\nwere particularly important for these data, as seeing fluctuations and passing thin clouds\nwould often change the stellar flux by a factor of 2 or 3 from one exposure to the next. By\nusing the unfringed \"C-track,\" which was picked off from the main starlight beam before it\nentered the interferometer, we were able to normalize the flux levels over the course of a\nscan, so that only true interferometric fringes remained.\nTo determine a topocentric radial velocity for each observation, we compared the\nnormalized interferograms to synthetic interferograms derived from a Doppler-shifted\ntemplate spectrum. We sampled the synthetic interferograms at the same delays as each\nobservation scan, and we scanned through a range of RVs until we found a smooth global\nminimum in the \u03c72 difference between the data and the model. This technique incorporated\nthe optimal weighting of the data and provided an estimate of the internal statistical error\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nin RV for each observation.\nWe employed two different types of template spectra for these RV fits. For the first\ntemplate, we used the FROID algorithm, described in detail in Paper 1, to turn the parallel\nnarrowband interferograms into a single high-resolution (R = 50,000) broadband spectrum\nfor each observation. All derived spectra for a given star were then shifted to zero Doppler\nvelocity and coadded to make a template specific to that star. The second template type\nwas generated using the SPECTRUM spectral synthesis package (Gray & Corbally 1994)\n(see also http://www.phys.appstate.edu/spectrum/spectrum.html) and ATLAS9 model\natmosphere grids (Kurucz 1993). We found that spectra generated using the default atomic\nline list resulted in sub-optimal RV solutions, because the depths of the synthetic absorption\nlines were not perfectly matched to the actual spectra. By adjusting the transition strength\nlog gf of each line individually (sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing), we were able\nto create synthetic templates which performed as well as the coadded templates. All of\nthe RV results presented below were derived using synthetic spectral templates instead of\ncoadded templates, but the RV results were very similar in all cases.\nAs a final step, we converted the topocentric velocities into barycentric velocities using\nthe IRAF tool BCVCORR. We also applied an additional velocity correction factor based\non the mean thorium-neon velocity offset for each night of observing, to account for RV\nshifts due to instrument realignment. We did not make any adjustment for the varying light\ntravel time within the binary systems, since the resulting change in RV is small compared\nto the RV measurement errors.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n6.\n\nRV measurements of reference stars\n\nTo verify that dFTS2 was stable, we observed three astronomical targets which were\nexpected to maintain a constant barycentric radial velocity over time.\n\n6.1.\n\n\u03b2 Ophiuchi\n\nThe star \u03b2 Ophiuchi (HR 6603, HD 161096, HIP 86742) is a K2III giant with an\napparent V magnitude of 2.77 and no known binary companion. We made 30 observations\nof \u03b2 Oph between March and June 2008, and the heliocentric RV data are plotted in\nFigure 6. The RV points exhibit an RMS scatter of 13.6 m/s around the mean. The RV\nerror is dominated by the temperature-induced instrument instability mentioned in Section\n4.3. Without this source of systematic error, we estimate that we could have achieved a\nmean RV accuracy of 2.1 m/s per observation on \u03b2 Oph, based upon \u03c72 analysis of photon\nstatistics in the interferogram data.\n\nFig. 6.- Radial velocity measurements of the K2III star \u03b2 Ophiuchi, with an RMS scatter\nof 13.6 m/s.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n6.2.\n\n\u03b2 Canum Venaticorum\n\nThe G0V star \u03b2 Canum Venaticorum (HR 4785, HD 109358, HIP 61317) was our\nsecond RV reference star. At V = 4.26, it tested the RV performance of our instrument at\nlower flux levels. Figure 7 depicts our RV results. We find an RMS scatter of the barycentric\nRV points of 13.8 m/s, similar to that of \u03b2 Oph because the error budget is dominated by\nthe same systematic error sources. If we were limited solely by photon statistics and CCD\nread noise, we estimate that dFTS2 could achieve a per-observation RV accuracy of 5.1 m/s\non this star.\n\nFig. 7.- Radial velocity measurements of the G0V star \u03b2 Canum Venaticorum, with an\nRMS scatter of 13.8 m/s.\n\n6.3.\n\nThe Moon\n\nAs our third RV test target, we observed sunlight reflected from the bright lunar crater\nM\u00f6sting A, which provided a flux level similar to a V = 2.8 star. We used lunar ephemerides\ncalculated with the MICA package (Oliversen et al. 2005) to shift the measured velocities\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nto a common reference frame. The resulting time series of velocities, shown in Figure 8, has\nan RMS scatter of 9.7 m/s. The mean internal error bar from photon statistics is 2.5 m/s\nfor these observations.\n\nFig. 8.- Radial velocity measurements of the G2V solar spectrum reflected from the lunar\ncrater M\u00f6sting A. The RMS scatter of the velocity points is 9.7 m/s.\n\n7.\n\nRV measurements of SB1 targets\n\nDuring our time at the Bok telescope, we observed a variety of single-lined (SB1) and\ndouble-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binary systems. The results for the SB1s are described\nbelow, while the orbital fits for the SB2s will be reported in a following publication. We had\nhoped to collect \u223c 40 RV points for each binary, well-distributed over the orbital phase, in\norder to derive the binary parameters with higher accuracy than ever before. Unfortunately,\nbureaucratic considerations led to the decommissioning of the dFTS2 instrument in August\n2008, and thus the end of our observing program. As a result, none of our orbital RV curves\nare well sampled, and for systems with P > 100 days we do not even cover a full orbit.\nThe orbital parameters that we derive from our RV measurements should therefore be\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nconsidered as preliminary results, which serve primarily to illustrate the potential usefulness\nof dFTS instrumentation for the accurate determination of binary star orbits.\nFor deriving orbital parameters from our RV data, we used the IDL routines CURVEFIT,\na nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm included with the IDL package, and HELIO RV,\nwhich computes binary star orbit velocities (Landsman 1993). In all cases, we adopted the\norbital period P from previously-published analyses, because we had too few data points to\nderive an accurate value.\n\n7.1.\n\n19 Draconis\n\nThe 19 Draconis system (HR 6315, HD 153597, HIP 82860) consists of a F6V star\nwith V = 4.89 co-orbiting with an unseen companion. With only nine RV observations, we\ncould not constrain the orbital period, so we adopted P = 52.1089 days from Abt & Levy\n(1976) but let all other orbital parameters vary in the fitting algorithm. Figure 9 shows\nthe RV points and the resulting orbit, with parameters Tperi = 54522.258 \u00b1 0.121 days,\nV0 = \u221220.5299 \u00b1 0.0649 km/s, K = 17.1590 \u00b1 0.0344 km/s, e = 0.2218 \u00b1 0.0020, and\n\u03c9 = 339.1\u25e6 \u00b1 0.6\u25e6 . The uncertainty on the value of K yields a fractional uncertainty \u2206K/K\nof 0.20%.\nThe RV residuals show an RMS scatter of 27.5 m/s, while the mean formal error bar\nwas 21.3 m/s, with \u03c72 = 12.19 for \u03bd = 4. We used the formal error bars in calculating\nthe parameter uncertainties cited above. If these error bars are scaled such that the mean\nerror bar is equal to the RMS scatter, then the uncertainty on K increases to 0.0444 km/s,\nor \u2206K/K = 0.26%. With relatively few data points, it is difficult to tell whether this\ndiscrepancy between the formal RV errors and the RV residual RMS is just a statistical\naberration, or is indicative of an additional RV error source, such as stellar pulsation or\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nthe spectral contribution of the faint secondary. As pointed out by our anonymous referee,\ncontamination from the secondary spectrum can add noise to RV measurements of the\nprimary. Using the Hipparcos parallax (Perryman et al. 1997) for 19 Dra, we calculate an\nabsolute magnitude of MV = 4.00, or L1 \u2243 2.15L\u2299 , assuming that the primary dominates\nthe total system flux. Based on the F6V spectral type, we estimate M1 \u2243 1.26M\u2299 . Using\nthe mass function for the system and i = 56.1\u25e6 from Jancart et al. (2005), we can then\nestimate M2 \u2243 0.54M\u2299 , or L2 \u2243 0.12L\u2299 for a main sequence star. The secondary might\ntherefore account for 6% of the total flux in V-band, which could be enough to influence the\nmeasured velocities for the primary, and might also be detectable. Future analysis work will\nattempt to detect the secondary spectrum, or place more stringent limits on its brightness.\n\nFig. 9.- Radial velocity measurements of the F6V star 19 Draconis. The RMS scatter of\nthe velocity residuals is 27.5 m/s.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n7.2.\n\n\u03c3 Geminorum\n\nThe star \u03c3 Geminorum (HR 2973, HD 62044, HIP 37629) has a V magnitude of 4.28\nand a spectral type of K1III. It is also listed as a RS CVn variable, and our measurements of\nspectral line widths imply a projected rotation velocity of 23.5 km/s, which may be related\nto its chromospheric activity level. Our RV measurements and best-fit orbit are plotted in\nFigure 10. As with 19 Dra, we adopt P = 19.6044 days from the literature (Massarotti et al.\n2008) and then derive: Tperi = 54603.597 \u00b1 0.189 days, V0 = 44.4206 \u00b1 0.0502 km/s,\nK = 34.3931 \u00b1 0.0456 km/s, e = 0.0141 \u00b1 0.0017, and \u03c9 = 5.1\u25e6 \u00b1 3.5\u25e6 . The RMS scatter of\nthe RV residuals is 25.5 m/s, as compared to a mean formal RV error bar of 29.8 m/s, and\n\u03c72 = 4.50 for nu = 3. The formal uncertainty on K implies \u2206K/K = 0.11%, but because\nnone of our RV points are located near velocity maxima or minima, this K value should be\nconsidered tentative at best and does not supersede the Massarotti results.\nUsing a similar procedure as with 19 Dra, we estimate a luminosity of 23L\u2299 for the\n\u03c3 Gem system. The spectral type of K1III implies a mass M1 = 4.2M\u2299 for the primary.\nThe orbital inclination angle of this binary is unknown, but assuming sin i = 90\u25e6 , we find a\nminimum mass M2 = 1.6M\u2299 , which for a main-sequence star implies L2 = 5.6L\u2299 , and thus\nL1 = 17.4L\u2299 . The secondary is therefore at least one third the brightness of the primary,\nand should be visible in the composite spectrum. However, our data are not suitable for\nattempting this detection, as all of our measured primary velocities are near the systemic\nvelocity, where the primary's spectral lines are likely to overlap heavily with those of the\nsecondary.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Radial velocity measurements of the K1III star \u03c3 Geminorum. The RMS scatter\nof the velocity residuals is 25.5 m/s.\n7.3.\n\n\u03b1 Draconis\n\n\u03b1 Draconis (HR 5291, HD 123299, HIP 68756) is an A0III star with V = 3.65 and\nan estimated v sin i = 26.6 km/s. Adopting P = 51.4167 days (Elst & Nelles 1983), we\nfind our RV data (Figure 11) are best fit by an orbit with Tperi = 54527.112 \u00b1 0.075 days,\nV0 = \u221215.5899 \u00b1 0.3035 km/s, K = 47.9340 \u00b1 0.2990 km/s, e = 0.4355 \u00b1 0.0042, and\n\u03c9 = 20.8\u25e6 \u00b1 0.5\u25e6 . Our determination of \u2206K/K is thus 0.62%. The mean formal error bar\n(172.9 m/s) and the RMS of the RV residuals (180.3 m/s) are larger than the other targets\nbecause hot stars have so few strong metal lines in their optical spectra. The orbital fit\ngives \u03c72 = 9.61 with \u03bd = 5.\nFrom the apparent magnitude and Hipparcos parallax of this system, we estimate\nL \u2243 270L\u2299 . Because A0III is a rare spectral type (perhaps in a transitional state between\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\ntwo types of chemically peculiar A stars (Adelman et al. 1987)), it is challenging to\ndetermine an appropriate mass. Kallinger et al. (2004) claim M1 = 2.8M\u2299 , which we\nwill adopt. Using our mass function and assuming i = 90\u25e6 , we find M2 \u2243 2.6M\u2299 , which\ncorresponds to a A2V spectral type with L \u2243 40L\u2299 . The secondary could therefore account\nfor 15% of the total luminosity of this system.\n\nFig. 11.- Radial velocity measurements of the A0III star \u03b1 Draconis. The RMS scatter of\nthe velocity residuals is 180.3 m/s.\n\n7.4.\n\n\u03b8 Ursae Majoris\n\n\u03b8 Ursae Majoris (HR 3775, HD 82328, HIP 46853, F6IV, V = 3.20) is listed in\nSIMBAD as a spectroscopic binary, but it does not appear in the SB9 binary catalog,\nand Wittenmyer et al. (2006) found no evidence of RV periodicity above \u223c 20 m/s. We\nmade six observations of this star during two different observing runs. We find that its\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nRV changed by about 180 m/s peak-to-peak, although our data do not fit any obvious\nKeplerian orbit (Figure 14). We hope to make further RV measurements of this star during\nfuture observing programs, to more firmly establish its binary status.\n\nFig. 12.- Radial velocity measurements of the F6IV star \u03b8 Ursae Majoris.\n\n8.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have described the design and operation of dFTS2, a next-generation incarnation\nof the dispersed Fourier Transform Spectrograph concept. This spectrometer produces\nR = 50,000 stellar optical spectra, with a wavelength calibration that enables accurate\nradial velocity measurement. The photon throughput and grating resolution of dFTS2 are\nsignificantly improved over its predecessor, resulting in better spectral accuracy on fainter\nstars, but thermal drifts inside the instrument limit its RV stability to \u223c 10 m/s. Given\na stable instrument temperature, our thorium-neon calibration data indicate that dFTS2\ncan reach RV stability better than 1.5 m/s RMS. These temperature issues will addressed\nin a future dFTS instrument, at which point the RV accuracy will be limited primarily by\nphoton statistics and intrinsic stellar velocity variability.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nWe have shown that dFTS2 can accurately measure the RV curves of single-lined\nspectroscopic binaries, with formal errors on the velocity amplitude K of approximately\n0.1% in some cases. Table 1 summarizes the derived orbital parameters. However, some of\nour results must be considered preliminary because of the relatively small number of data\npoints. When the third-generation dFTS has been constructed and deployed, we anticipate\nbeing able to significantly improve the RV measurements of spectroscopic binaries, and in\nconjunction with astrometry from spatial interferometers, determine the masses of stars\nwith unprecedented accuracy.\n\nTable 1.

We also express\nour appreciation to the Director of the Steward Observatory for granting us telescope time\nover an extended period.\nWe are greatly indebted to the skilled instrument builders in the USNO Machine Shop\n- Gary Wieder, Dave Smith, Tie Siemers, and John Evans - for fabricating all of the\ncustom optomechanical elements of dFTS2, as well as the thermal enclosure. We also thank\nthe USNO Astrometry Department for travel support and salary support during the initial\nstages of this observing program, and thanks also go to the USNO Time Services Division\nfor lending us packing crates for shipment of our instrument to Kitt Peak.\nThis research has made use of the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg,\nFrance; NASA's Astrophysics Data System; and the SB9 catalog of Pourbaix et al. (2004).\nRichard O. Gray is to be commended for making his SPECTRUM codes so easy to install\nand use.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAbt, H. A., & Levy, S. G. 1976, ApJS, 30, 273\nAdelman, S.
