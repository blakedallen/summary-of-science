Introduction\nThe production and properties of hyperons have been studied for more than 50\nyears, mostly in pion and kaon induced reactions. Hyperon production in pp collisions has been investigated close to threshold at SATURNE (Saclay, France) and\nCOSY-J\u00fclich. Reasonably complete information on \u039b(1116), \u03a30 (1192), \u03a30 (1385),\n\u039b(1405) and \u039b(1520) can be found in the Review of Particle Physics.1\nFor the \u039b(1405), in spite of rather high statistics achieved (the total world\nstatistics is several thousand events), there are still open questions concerning the\nnature of this resonance: is it a singlet qqq state in the frame of SU(3) or a quarkgluon (uds-q) hybrid, or a KN bound state?2 \u2212 10\nOn the contrary, the \u03a3(1480) hyperon is not well established yet and it is described as a 'bump' with unknown quantum numbers.1 The Crystal Ball experiment\nhas not seen any indications for the resonance \u03a3(1480) in the \u03c0 0 \u039b invariant mass\ndistribution measured in the reaction K \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u039b, dominated by the \u03a3(1385).11\nThe program to investigate hyperon production from pp interactions at low\nenergies is very well suited for the ANKE spectrometer operated at COSY\u2013J\u00fclich.\n1\n\n\fNovember\n9,\n2018 16:57 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\nzychor \u0307proceedings \u0307STORI08\n\n2\n\nFILE\n\nI.

Experiment and particle identification with ANKE\nThe experiments have been performed with the ANKE spectrometer12 at the\nCooler SYnchrotron COSY at the Research Center J\u00fclich (Germany).13\nCOSY is a medium energy cooler synchrotron and storage ring for both polarized\nand unpolarized protons and deuterons. At COSY various targets can be used, e.g.\nsolid or cluster\u2013jet. COSY provides beams in the momentum range between 0.6\nand 3.7 GeV/c.\nANKE (\"Apparatus for Studies of Nucleon and Kaon Ejectiles\") is a magnetic\nspectrometer located at an internal target position of COSY. It consists of three\ndipole magnets, see Fig. 2. The central C\u2013shaped spectrometer dipole D2, placed\ndownstream of the target, separates the reaction products from the circulating\nCOSY beam. The ANKE detection system, comprising range telescopes, scintillation counters and multi\u2013wire proportional chambers, simultaneously registers both\npositively and negatively charged particles and measures their momenta.14\nThe ANKE telescopes are used to register positively charged particles. They discriminate pions, kaons and protons with the same momenta due to their different\nenergy losses. Passive copper degraders in the telescopes between the scintillation\ncounters enhance the discrimination efficiency. The K + mesons are stopped in the\n\u2206E counters or in the second degrader of each telescope. Their decay, mainly into\n\u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc and \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 with a lifetime of \u03c4 = 12.4 ns, provides a very effective criterion\n\n\fNovember\n9,\n2018 16:57 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\nzychor \u0307proceedings \u0307STORI08\n\nFILE\n\nExcited Hyperons Produced in pp Collisions with ANKE@COSY\n\n3\n\nNEGATIVE EJECTILES\n\nD2\nTOF-stop\nTOF-stop\n\nCurved\nCherenkovs\n\nMWPC\n\nD1\n\nTOF-start\nMWPC\n\nTarget\n\nD3\n\nTOF-start\nMWPC\n\nPD\n\nFD Hodoscope\n\nTe\n\nle\n\n1m\n\nsc\n\nop\n\nes\n\nSide hodoscope\n\nPOSITIVE EJECTILES\n\nFig. 2.

By measuring such delayed signals from the decay of\nstopped kaons, positively charged kaons can be identified at ANKE in a background\nof pions, protons and scattered particles up to 106 times more intense.15 The use of\nveto counters causes a decrease of particle identification efficiency, typically by factor of 6. The tracks of the ejectiles, measured with multi-wire proportional chambers\n(MWPCs), are used to reconstruct momenta of any registered particle.\nData originally taken for scalar meson16 and \u03c617 production have been used\nto study the production of low-lying hyperon resonances in pp collisions with\nANKE@COSY.

In the charge\u2013mirrored pp \u2192 pK + \u03c0 \u2212 X + case(right),\nthe \u03c0 \u2212 may originate from different sources, e.g. a decay with the \u03a3+ (1189) or\na secondary decay of \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 , arising from the major background reaction\npp \u2192 pK + \u039b \u2192 pK + \u03c0 \u2212 p. Protons from this reaction are easily rejected by cutting the missing mass M M (pK +\u03c0 \u2212 ) around the proton mass.\n\n\fNovember\n9,\n2018 16:57 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\nzychor \u0307proceedings \u0307STORI08\n\nFILE\n\nExcited Hyperons Produced in pp Collisions with ANKE@COSY\n\n5\n\nIf only events around the \u03a3 mass are selected, then the missing mass spectrum\nM M (pK + ) in the reaction pp \u2192 pK + \u03c0 + X \u2212 shows two peaks, see in the middle\u2013\nleft part in Fig. 3. One of them corresponds to the contribution of \u03a30 (1385) and\n\u039b(1405) hyperons. The second peak is located at a mass \u223c1480 MeV/c2 . In the\n\u03c0 \u2212 X + case, the distribution also peaks at 1480 MeV/c2 , see the right\u2013middle part\nin Fig. 3.\nWe have assumed that the measured missing mass M M (pK +) spectra can be\nexplained by the production of hyperon resonances and non-resonant contributions.\nDetailed Monte Carlo simulations have been performed including the production of\nwell established excited hyperons (\u03a30 (1385), \u039b(1405), \u039b(1520)) and non-resonant\ncontributions like pp \u2192 N K + \u03c0X and pp \u2192 N K + \u03c0\u03c0X; X denotes any hyperon\nwhich could be produced in the experiment. For both final states the shape of the\nmeasured distributions cannot be reproduced by the simulations and an excess of\n2\nevents is observed around the missing mass of 1480 MeV/c . Thus, an the excited\n0\u2217\n\u00b1 \u2213\nhyperon Y\ndecaying via \u03c0 X was included into simulations. The best fit to\nthe experimental data was obtained for the Y 0\u2217 with a mass M (Y 0\u2217 ) = (1480 \u00b1\n2\n2\n15) MeV/c and a width \u0393 (Y 0\u2217 ) = (60\u00b115) MeV/c , see lower parts in Fig. 3. There\n+ \u2212\nhave been identified 100 and 1000 events for \u03c0 X and \u03c0 \u2212 X + case, respectively.\nThe statistical significance of the signal, assuming that this is due to the production\nof the Y 0\u2217 , is between 4 and 6 \u03c3 depending on a procedure. The production cross\nsection is of the order of few hundred nanobarns.18\n4. The \u039b(1405) hyperon\nThe pp \u2192 pK + p\u03c0 \u2212 X 0 reaction is selected by a multiparticle final state, containing\ntwo protons, a positively charged kaon, a negatively charged pion and an unidentified residue X 0 . In the \u03a30 (1385) \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 0 decay the X 0 residue is a \u03c0 0 while, for\nthe \u039b(1405) \u2192 \u03a30 \u03c0 0 decay, X 0 = \u03c0 0 \u03b3 (see Fig. 1). In the upper part of Fig. 4\na distribution of M M (pF d K + ) versus M M (pK + \u03c0 \u2212 p) is plotted for events with\nthe invariant mass M (pSd \u03c0 \u2212 ) of the pSd \u03c0 \u2212 pairs corresponding to the mass of\nthe \u039b, i.e. between 1112 and 1120 MeV/c2 . The two horizontal bands show the\nfour\u2013particle missing\u2013mass M M (pK +\u03c0 \u2212 p) criteria used to separate the \u03a30 (1385)\ncandidates from those of the \u039b(1405). The lower band is optimised to identify a \u03c0 0\nwhereas the upper one selects masses significantly greater than m(\u03c0 0 ).\nIn order to extract the \u039b(1405) distribution from the measured \u03a30 \u03c0 0 decay,\nthe non\u2013resonant contributions have been fitted to the experimental data. After\nsubtracting them from the data, the distribution shown as experimental points in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 4 was obtained. 156 events have been identified in this\nspectrum.19\nThe (\u03a3\u03c0)0 invariant\u2013mass distributions have been previously studied in two hydrogen bubble chamber experiments.

In the lower panel in Fig.4 our experimental points\nare compared to the results of the LEPS experiment (for comparison with data of\nThomas and Hemingway see Ref. 19). Despite the very different production mechanisms, all four distributions have similar shapes and positions. This might suggest\nthat, if there are two states present in this region, then the reaction mechanisms\nin the four cases are preferentially populating the same one. It should, however, be\nnoted that by identifying a particular reaction mechanism, the proponents of the\ntwo\u2013state solution can describe the shape of the distribution that we have found.23\n\n\fNovember\n9,\n2018 16:57 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\nzychor \u0307proceedings \u0307STORI08\n\nFILE\n\nExcited Hyperons Produced in pp Collisions with ANKE@COSY\n\n7\n\n5.
