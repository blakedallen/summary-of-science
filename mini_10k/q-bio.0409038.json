[5] have studied Fibonacci polyGC quasiperiodic sequences based on the inflation rule\nG \u2192GC and C \u2192G, which gives successively G, GC, GCG, GCGGC, GCGGCGCG, . . . for\nsequences of length 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . . respectively. It appears that such Fibonacci sequences can\nbe used as prototypes for strongly correlated DNA segments as long as ~160 nm (i.e., ~450 bp).\nMore than fifty years ago, Weyl [9] showed that the symmetry in biological phenotypes\ncan be quantified by basic group theory, as shown for example in Fig. 1. That Fibonacci and\nother symmetries may exist in the sequences of DNA's, RNA's and certain proteins is suggested\nby the recent findings of motif pattern sequences-- the so-called seqlets [3, 4] that occur\nrepeatedly in proteins. Typically featuring about 10 amino acid residue positions that are fixed\nto within conservative substitutions but usually separated by a number of prescribed gaps with\narbitrary residue content, the existence of protein-fragment seqlets poses an intriguing question:\nDo certain seqlets have a sequence with a symmetry precisely quantifiable by group theory?\nThis question is answered affirmatively in the present communication. We have found a precise\nmodular Fibonacci sequence in a continuous gap-free 10-residue seqlet with either 3 or 4\nconservative amino acid substitutions. Unambiguous statistical significance is attached to this\nmodular Fibonacci seqlet, for it occurs nine times in the SWISS-Prot/TrEMBL database [1,2] of\nnatural proteins. As in many cases of phenotypic symmetry [9], cyclic group theory here again\nprovides the medium for the analysis.\n\nNucleotide and codon representative cyclic groups. - We start with a purely physical\n\nC4 (cyclic group of order 4) representation for the nucleotides. As shown in Table 1, the\nnumber of oxygen and nitrogen atoms n o and n N along with the molecular ring numbers r\n\n1\n\n\fengender the complex number z = (i)\n\nnO\n\n( \u20131)\n\nn N \u2013r\n\nfor each nucleotide. Constituting a\n\nrepresentation of C 4 , the four complex numbers have the form z = exp(i n\u03c0 / 2) where [6,7]\nn(U) = 0, n(C) = 1, n(A) = 2 and n(G) = 3. Note that under the complementarity transpositions\nU \u2194 A, C \u2194 G, we have z \u2192 \u2013z for all z.\nNext, we make the biologically appropriate foliation of the C4 cyclic group for the\nnucleotides into a C 64 (cyclic group of order 64) representation for the codons. Let 5' (N\u2013 N\nN+) 3' denote a generic codon with the successive triplet of nucleotides N\u2013 , N , N+. Then the\ncodon's C 64 representative is defined by\n\n1/4\n\n1/16\n\nZ = (z\u2013 ) z (z+ )\n\n= exp (iN \u03c0 / 32)\n\n(1)\n\nin which z \u2013 , z, z + are the C 4 representatives of the respective nucleotides and the principalbranch roots are taken by the fractional exponents on z \u2013 and z + in the middle member of (1).\nThe codon number N introduced by implicit definition in the final member of (1) is therefore\ngiven by [6,7]\n\nN = 4 n \u2013 + 16n + n +\n\n(2)\n\nThus, for example, with 5' (N\u2013 N N+) 3' = AUG for Methionine, we have N = 4n(A) + 16n(U) +\nn(G) = 11. Observe that N runs from 0 to 63 along with the codons in the natural progression of\nthe universal genetic code (see Table 2). Finally, the code itself assigns one of the 20 amino\nacids or the \"stop\" signal to each codon, and thus concomitantly to its codon number N. Hence,\na value for N implies an amino acid or the \"stop\" signal (the latter, in the cases N = 34, 35 or 50).\nMoreover, a sequence of Z's of the form (1), or equivalently a sequence of N values, implies a\nspecific polypeptide which may or may not be a continuous gap-free seqlet.\n\n2\n\n\fModular Fibonacci sequences. - Now let Z k\u20131 , Z k , Z k+1 denote the C 64\nrepresentatives of three successive codons in an mRNA. Suppose that through the formation\nmechanism of the mRNA the representative Z k+1 depends on its two predecessors Z k , Z k\u20131\nin a symmetrical-function manner over a range of integer k values, thereby representing a grouptheoretic direct-product surjection of the form C 64 (k) x C 64 (k\u20131) \u2192 C 64 (k +1). The only\nuniformly consistent way that this can happen is for the C 64 representatives to satisfy Z k+1 =\n\nZ k Z k\u20131 for all k in the range, a relation equivalent to the modular Fibonacci sequence\ncondition\n\nN k+1 = ( Nk + N k\u20131 ) (mod 64)\n\n(3)\n\nHere \"mod 64\" instructs one to \"subtract 64 from the sum if it is greater than 63\", for Z in (1) is\nunchanged by N \u2192 (N \u2013 64) and N ranges from 0 to 63 by definition in (2).\nA sequence of Nk 's (to which there is an associated polypeptide) follows from (3) if one\nprescribes N1 , N 2 and the range of k. As a prime example, consider the biological sequence\nthat features N1 = 11 for M (see Table 2), the \"start\" signal for a protein, and N 2 = 33, which is\nM's partner under nucleotide complementarity: N1 = 11 \u21d4 AUG \u2194 UAC \u21d4 N 2 = 33.\nThen (3) employed recursively produces the sequence\n11 33 44 13 57 6 63 5 4 9 13 22 35\nNote that we have terminated the sequence at k = 13, because N13 = 35 signals \"stop\". By using\nTable 2 the sequence translates into the polypeptide\nM Y D V S L G L L I V P (stop)\nwhich finally yields the modular Fibonacci seqlet\n\n3\n\n\fY D V S L G L L I V\n\n(4)\n\nIn (4) we have deleted the M (interpreted as a \"start\" signal) and the P (for terminal deletion\nsymmetry). The standard equivalence classes for amino acid conservative substitutions are {F,\nY}, {L, I, M, V}, {S, T}, {P}, {A, G}, {H}, {Q, N}, {K. R}, {D. E}, {C}, [W}, as permitted\nby the SWISS-Prot/TrEMBL BLAST program [1,2].

For an incidentally random sequence, the probability of a\nsingle appearance of a biological equivalent of (4) with Y in the first position and j conservative\nsubstitutes in the subsequent nine positions is given approximately by \u03c6 j = (9!/(9\u2013j)! j!)\n10\u2013j\n\n(.05 )\n\n(.11 ) (5.04 \u00d7107), in which (.05) is the average probability for any one of the 20\nj\n\namino acids, (.11) is the average probability for an amino acid or one of its biological\nequivalents, and (5.04 \u00d7107) is the approximate number of total letters, i.e., chances for a hit in\nthe database; for j = 3 and 4 we therefore have \u03c6 3 = 4.40 \u00d710\n\n5\n\n\u20133\n\nand \u03c6 4 =1.45 \u00d710\n\n\u20132\n\n. Thus,\n\n\feven with suitable latitude given to evolutionary correlations between the SWISS-Prot/TrEMBL\nprotein fragments cited above, it follows that the incidental random-sequence composite\nprobability for three j = 3 and six j = 4 conformances is small enough to preclude an incidental\norigin for the accord with virtual certainty. Therefore, the modular Fibonacci seqlet shown in (4)\ncan be deemed to be genuinely biophysical.\n\nA possible dynamical origin for modular Fibonacci seqlets. - In conclusion, it should\nbe emphasized that the nucleotide group C 4 , the codon group C 64 , and hence a modular\nFibonacci sequence in proteins have a precise biophysical underpinning in terms of nucleotide\nand codon aerobic-atom content and molecular ring structure, as expressed by and n\u039f , n N and\nr. The z's of C4 and the Z's of C 64 may perhaps also have a quantum physics origin as\nwavefunction prefactors that result from the nucleotide and codon production reactions.\nConsonant with their aerobic-atom content and molecular ring structure, the z's may have\noriginated dynamically as relative prefactors in the nucleotide groundstate wavefunctions; if so,\nthe phase angles in the z, n \u03c0 / 2, may be interpreted as residual Berry phase angles [8] from the\nnucleotide production process. Furthermore, if the Z k 's are residual Berry phase factors from\nthe codon production process, then the relation Z k+1 = Z k Z k\u20131 and its equivalent (3)\n*\nminimize an energy of the form \u2013 \u03b5 Re( \u2211 Z k+1 Z k Z k\u20131 ), where the constant \u03b5 is the\nk\n\nmagnitude of an intercodon binding energy increment in the mRNA groundstate. Irrespective of\nthe underlying mechanism, however, the biophysical genuineness of the modular Fibonacci\nsequence is clearly indicated statistically.\n\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgements. - M.D. is grateful for the helpful communications received from Elisabeth\nGasteiger on the BLAST program procedures.

The code associates 61 mRNA\ncodons-ordered triplets of the nucleotides U, C, A, G-with the 20 lifeform amino acids. In\nparticular, AUG for M also serves as a \"start\" signal for a protein, while UAA, UAG and UGA\nsignal \"stop\" by not being associated with any amino acid. The codon number N [given by Eq.\n(2)] appears to the left of each respective codon, and the associated amino acid along with its\nletter symbol appears to the right of its codon correspondents.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n0\n\nUUU Phenylalanine\n\n1 UUC\nF\n______________\n2 UUA\n3\n\nUUG\n\n4\n\n16\n\nUCU\n\n17\n\nUCC\n\n18\n\nUCA\n\n32 UAU\nSerine\nS\n\nTyrosine\n\n33 UAC\nY\n______________\n34 UAA (stop)\n\n48 UGU\n\nCysteine\n\n49 UGC\nC\n______________\n50 UGA (stop)\n______________\n51 UGG Tryptophan W\n______________\n52 CGU\n\nCUU Leucine\n\n19 UCG\n______________\n20 CCU\n\n35 UAG (stop)\n______________\n36 CAU Histidine\n\n5\n\nCUC\n\n21\n\nCCC\n\nProline\n\n53 CGC\n\nArginine\n\n6\n\nCUA\n\n22\n\nCCA\n\nP\n\n37 CAC\nH\n______________\n38 CAA Glutamine\n\n54 CGA\n\nR\n\nL\n\n7 CUG\n______________\n8 AUU\n\n23 CCG\n______________\n24 ACU\n\n39 CAG\nQ\n______________\n40 AAU Asparagine\n\n55 CGG\n______________\n56 AGU Serine\n\n9\n\nAUC Isoleucine\n\n25\n\nACC\n\n10 AUA\nI\n____________\n11 AUG Methionine M\n____________(start)\n12 GUU\n\n26\n\nACA\n\n41 AAC\nN\n______________\n42 AAA Lysine\n\n57 AGC\nS\n______________\n58 AGA Arginine\n\n27 ACG\n____________\n28 GCU\n\n43 AAG\nK\n____________\n44 GAU Aspartic acid\n\n59 AGG\nR\n____________\n60 GGU\n\n13\n\nGUC Valine\n\n29\n\nGCC\n\nAlanine\n\n61 GGC\n\nGlycine\n\n14\n\nGUA\n\n30\n\nGCA\n\nA\n\n45 GAC\nD\n____________\n46 GAA Glutamic acid\n\n62 GGA\n\nG\n\n15\n\nGUG\n\n31\n\nGCG\n\n47 GAG\n\n63 GGG\n\nV\n\nThreonine\nT\n\nE\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n11\n\n\f"}
