Since the optical depth falls rapidly with increasing energy,\none should probe the arrival directions of the highest energy events beyond 1020 eV on an event by\nevent basis to circumvent this effect.\nPACS numbers: Valid PACS appear here\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe problem of the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic\nrays has generally been expressed as the conjunction of\ntwo questions: (i) how can particles be accelerated to\nenergies in excess of 1020 eV? (ii) why is the source not\nseen in the arrival directions of the highest energy events?\nProgress on the former question has certainly been hindered by our relative lack of knowledge on acceleration\nmechanisms and high energy processes in the most powerful astrophysical objects. Regarding the latter question, progress has been mostly limited by the scarcity of\nexperimental data at the highest energies, at least until\nvery recently.\nIndeed the first results of the Pierre Auger Observatory, which have just been published, report a significant\ncorrelation of the arrival directions of the highest energy\nevents with a catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\ncloser than 75 Mpc [1, 2]. This observation certainly\nmarks an important step in the search for the source of\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays. However one should not\noverinterpret the significance of these results. In particular, the likelihood of the reported coincidence rests\non the comparison with isotropic arrival directions, yet\nthe large scale structure is known to be highly inhomogeneous at least up to 75 Mpc. Since AGN are known\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: kotera@iap.fr\naddress: lemoine@iap.fr\n\nto cluster with the large scale structure, one cannot exclude at present that the observed correlation remains\na coincidence if the source itself clusters with the large\nscale structure [2]. More will be said on these data in\nSection IV of the present paper.\nFurthermore, there exist other (and sometimes contradictory) claims in the literature on the existence of\ncorrelations of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray arrival directions with various source catalogs [3], the strongest being the association with BL Lacertae objects reported in\nRefs. [4, 5, 6] (see also Refs. [7, 8]). Since the existing\ndata is so scarce at the highest energies, the assessment\nof the statistical significance remains a difficult task. Finally, the reported evidence for multiplets of events tends\nto suggest that the source lies in the arrival direction of\nthe events clusters. However some of these clusters show\ninteracting galaxies as the sole peculiar objects on the\nline of sight [9], while a more recent multiplet appears\ncorrelated with interacting clusters of galaxies [10, 11].\nTaken at face value, all these claims do not allow to draw\na clear and consistent picture of the source of ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic rays.\nIt is admitted that cosmic magnetic fields must play a\nkey role in this puzzle, although which role exactly is also\na question that is still seeking for an answer. And this\nsource of uncertainty is in turn related to our poor knowledge of the strength and the distribution of extragalactic\nmagnetic fields (see Ref. [12, 13] for detailed reviews of\nexisting data). There exists a rather large body of literature on the relation between cosmic magnetic fields\nand ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. Most studies have con-\n\n\f2\nstructed models of extragalactic magnetic fields and then\nresorted to Monte Carlo simulations in order to quantify\nthe influence of these fields on the time, energy and angular images expected in large scale detectors. One must\nhowever underline the analytical works of Refs. [14, 15]\non cosmic ray transport in tangled extragalactic magnetic\nfields of homogeneous power, those of Refs. [16, 17] which\ndiscuss the particular effect of magnetic lensing and finally Refs. [18, 19, 20] which discuss diffusive transport\nin a magnetized supercluster.\nEarlier numerical studies have addressed the phenomenology of ultrahigh energy proton propagation in\ntangled magnetic fields of homogeneous power [21, 22,\n23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. There has since been a trend\ntoward more realistic magnetic field configurations. For\ninstance, Refs. [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] have studied the\ndiffusive or non-diffusive propagation in a magnetized local supercluster and Ref. [35] has brought to light the\nspectral distortions induced by the interaction of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with a supercluster harboring\nlarge scale regular magnetic fields. More recently, several\nstudies have attempted to model a realistic configuration\nin which the magnetic field follows the matter density\nand then studied the transport of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in the resulting structure. In order to construct\nthe magnetic field, Refs. [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] have\nused numerical simulations of large scale structure formation involving a passive magnetic field whose strength\nwas normalized to the value measured in clusters of galaxies. Refs. [43, 44, 45, 46] have rather reconstructed the\nextragalactic magnetic field by scaling the field strength\nto the underlying density field.\nIn general, these studies have assumed the magnetic\nfield to be all pervading (albeit, with a more or less pronounced degree of inhomogeneity) so that magnetic deflection has been modeled as a continuous process. This\nassumption has been relaxed in Ref. [47] which provides\nnumerical simulations of cosmic ray arrival directions after scattering with fossils of radio-galaxy lobes. Similarly,\nRef. [48] has mentioned the possibility of discrete cosmic\nray interactions with localized regions of enhanced magnetic fields, their discussion pointing toward clusters of\ngalaxies as the main scattering agents.\nThis picture in which ultrahigh energy cosmic ray\ntransport occurs through random discrete events is indeed more likely to be valid on distance scales up to a\nfew hundreds of Mpc as a consequence of the high degree\nof clustering of matter in the Universe. For instance, even\nif the magnetic field were produced in a uniform manner\nat high redshift (see Ref. [49] for a review of models of the\norigin of large scale magnetic fields), then the present-day\nmagnetic field should be highly inhomogeneous, as a result of the amplification of the magnetic field in the shear\nand compressive flows associated with the formation of\nnon-linear structures [40, 41, 45, 50, 51] (see also [52] for\na general discussion). In these simulations, voids in the\nlarge scale structure are essentially deprived of magnetic\nfield.\n\nFurthermore, if one attributes the origin of the extragalactic magnetic field to pollution by a sub-class of\ngalaxies, for instance starburst galaxies [53, 54, 55] or\nradio-galaxies [56, 57, 58], the magnetic field configuration should resemble that of a percolating process (see\nRef. [59] for a clear illustration). As explained further\nbelow, if the filling factor of the polluted regions becomes comparable to that of the filaments of large scale\nstructure, the filaments themselves become the scattering\nagents as in Refs. [40, 41, 45, 51].\nThe goal of the present paper is to provide an analytical description of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray transport\nin such an inhomogeneous medium, which is modeled by\nscattering centers embedded in an unmagnetized intergalactic medium.\nThese scattering centers comprise the filaments just as\nthe clusters of galaxies but also all possible regions of\nlocally enhanced magnetic fields, such as galactic winds,\ngroups of galaxies, large scale structure shocks and fossil radio-galaxy cocoons. One motivation of the present\nwork is thus to make progress toward a more realistic\nmagnetic field configuration which takes into account\nthose localized regions of intense magnetic activity. In\norder to do so, we first sketch a census of relevant scattering centers (Section II) then analyse their respective\ninfluence.\nThe present work is further motivated by the fact that\nRefs. [40, 41, 45, 51] diverge as to the conclusions they\ndraw on the influence of the extragalactic magnetic fields\non ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, even though they try\nto construct ab initio predictions for the distribution of\nthese large scale magnetic fields. This difference stems\nfrom the uncertainty on the origin of these magnetic\nfields, not withstanding the complexity of modeling accurately the evolution of magnetic fields in the formation\nof large scale structure. Analytical tools become useful\nin this context as they allow to parametrize the influence of such magnetic fields on the images and spectra of\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays. This in turn will help to\ndeconvolve this effect from existing and upcoming data,\nand therefore to infer useful constraints on these magnetic fields.\nIn the present description, magnetic deflection is no\nlonger a continuous process, but is instead dominated\nby scattering events. We thus use the notion of the optical depth of the Universe to ultrahigh energy cosmic\nray scattering and discuss the phenomenological consequences. In particular, we show that the optical depth\ndecreases very abruptly as the energy increases, because\nthe source distance scale decreases due to increasing energy losses, and because the influence of cosmic magnetic\nfields diminishes with increasing energy.\nWe argue that the energy beyond which the Universe\nbecomes translucent or transparent to cosmic ray scattering may be tantalizingly close to the threshold beyond which experiments search for counterparts, E \u2243\n4 \u2212 6 \u00d7 1019 eV. This could have profound consequences\nfor our interpretation of existing data. For instance, if\n\n\f3\nmost sources lie beyond the last scattering surface, one\ncould mistake the scattering centers on the last scattering surface (such as starbursts, old radio-galaxies or giant\nshock waves) with the source of ultrahigh energy cosmic\nrays.\nThe phenomenological consequences thus differ widely\nfrom the case of continuous deflection in an all-pervading\nmedium. We thus discuss in some detail the expected effects and their relation to current and future observations\nof cosmic ray arrival directions.\nThis paper is laid out as follows. In Section II, we\nsketch a census of possible scattering centers and their\ninfluence on the optical depth of the Univers to cosmic\nray scattering. We also calculate the distance to the last\nscattering surface and compare it to the expected source\ndistance scale. In Section III, we discuss the transport\nof cosmic rays in this strongly inhomogeneous medium\nand the expected observational consequences. We notably provide sky maps of the expected optical depth up\nto different distances for our local Universe. Finally, in\nSection IV, we summarize our findings and comment on\nthe existing data in the framework of the present model.\nThe physics of the interaction of cosmic rays with scattering centers is discussed in Appendix A.\n\nII. THE OPTICAL DEPTH OF THE UNIVERSE\nTO HIGH ENERGY COSMIC RAY SCATTERING\nA.\n\nScattering centers in the large scale structure\n\nWe adopt a description in which the extragalactic magnetic field is inhomogeneous. If this magnetic field originates from a sub-class of galaxies, its configuration is\nbound to follow that of the large scale structure since\nthe mixing length in the Universe is small for cosmological standards: for typical intergalactic velocities of\n\u223c 300 km/s, the length traveled in a Hubble time is only\n\u2243 4 Mpc. Note that the mixing length is even less in\nfilaments, for which the typical dispersion of velocities is\nof order 50 km/s.\nObviously, at a given energy, the total optical depth\nto cosmic ray scattering is dominated by the structures\nwith the largest n\u03c3, where n represents the space density and \u03c3 the cross-section of the magnetized halo. One\nshould thus focus on the radio halos of radio-galaxies, the\nmagnetized winds of star forming galaxies, and on larger\nscales to clusters of galaxies and filaments as well as their\nsurrounding accretion shock waves.\n\n1.\n\nRadio halos\n\nRadio halos of old radio-galaxies (deemed radio ghosts)\nhave been already considered as possible sites of ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic ray scattering in Ref. [47]. This study evaluates their space density as nrg \u2243 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22121 Mpc\u22123 ,\nthe radius of their magnetized halos as rrg \u223c 0.5\u22121 Mpc\n\nand their magnetic field Brg \u223c 1 \u03bcG. Such quasar outflows have also been examined in detail in Ref. [57] as a\nsite of magnetic pollution of the intergalactic medium,\nbut their results differ from those above. These latter authors find a much lower magnetic field strength\nBrg \u223c 10\u22129 G, and a substantially larger extent, rrg \u2243\n1 \u2212 5 Mpc, for a comparable space density. With respect\nto the results of Ref. [57], the scattering should be dominated by the sub-population of recently formed quasars\n(at redshifts z . 4), which have rrg \u223c 2 \u2212 4 Mpc and\nBrg \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 G. The main difference between these\ncalculations results from the different modeling of the\nbubble evolution. The former study assumes that the\nbubble settles in pressure equilibrium in a rather dense\nand hot intergalactic environment (with \u03c1/h\u03c1i \u223c 30 and\nT \u2243 108 K) while the latter argues that the bubble expands until its velocity matches that of the Hubble flow\nand takes the surrounding IGM to be much colder and\nless dense (T \u223c 104 K and \u03c1/h\u03c1i = 1). Both fix the\nmagnetic strength to lie at a fraction of equipartition\nwith thermal energy, although this fraction to equipartition \u01ebB = 0.5 in Ref. [47] and \u01ebB = 0.1 in Ref. [57]; furthermore, Ref. [57] adopt \u01ebB as the equipartition fraction\nbefore expansion of the bubble, assuming that the magnetic field then decays with expansion. This study thus\nneglects all possible further amplification mechanisms of\nB, hence their estimate (at a given \u01ebB ) should be considered as a lower limit. If one instead considers \u01ebB as the\nequipartition fraction of the magnetic field at present, the\nmagnetic field strength inside the bubble can be related\nto the kinetic energy of the outflow and the size of the\nbubble as follows:\nBrg = 5\u00d710\n\n\u22128\n\nG\n\n\u0010 \u01eb \u00111/2 \u0012\nB\n\n0.1\n\nErg\n59\n10 ergs\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nrrg\n1 Mpc\n\n\u0013\u22123/2\n\n(1)\nThis latter estimate agrees with the conclusions of\nRef. [58] which studies the degree of magnetization of\nthe IGM by radio-galaxies jets and lobes. The outflow energy 1059 ergs is an average energy for a quasar\npopulation [47]: it corresponds to a black hole mass\nMBH \u2243 3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 , radiating Lbol \u2243 3 \u00d7 1045 ergs/s\nover 107 yrs [57]. Note however that the observational\ncompilation of Ref. [60] leads to slightly higher values\nfor Erg and Brg . These authors have observed that the\nlobes of 70% of field radio-galaxies in their sample have a\nmuch higher energy content \u223c 1060 \u2212 1061 ergs than the\nremaining 30% in clusters (about 1058 ergs), with a typical volume V \u223c 0.03 \u2212 0.3 Mpc3 and inferred minimum\nenergy magnetic field strengths in the range 3 \u2212 30 \u03bcG. If\nthe magnetic field is to decay as V 2/3 during the subsequent expansion of these bubbles, the final value for Brg\nwould be of order 0.1 \u03bcG for a typical radius rrg \u2243 3 Mpc\nas above. In the following, we thus consider the possible\nrange of values Brg = 1 \u2212 10 \u00d7 10\u22128 G and typical radius\nrrg \u2243 1 \u2212 3 Mpc.\nFinally, Refs. [47, 57] estimate the space density of\nquasar outflows from the observed density of quasars at\n\n.\n\n\f4\nhigh redshifts and the typical duration of the quasar\nphase (taken as 107 yrs). Their estimate of \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212\n10\u22121 Mpc\u22123 agrees with the recent determinations of the\nblack hole number density at low redshifts, in particular n(> 107 M\u2299 ) \u2243 2 \u2212 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123 [61], although\nRef. [62] reports a number density that is smaller by\nabout an order of magnitude. In what follows, we thus\nconsider the range nrg = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123 .\n\nand optimistic assumptions concerning the amplification\nof Bgw . Such amplification may have been detected in\nthe outflow of M82, where a magnetic field strength as\nhigh as 10 \u03bcG [70] has been reported in the first 10 kpc.\nRef. [54] has argued that the magnetic field could be amplified through the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability during\nejection.\n\n3.\n2.\n\nClusters of galaxies\n\nMagnetized galactic winds\n\nGalactic winds have been proposed as a source of magnetic pollution of the intergalactic medium by various authors, see in particular [53, 54, 55]. Such outflows have\nbeen observed in different galaxies, for instance in the\nstarbursting nearby dwarf galaxy M82 with wind speed\nv \u2243 2000 km/s and extension \u223c 10 kpc [63], or in massive star forming Lyman break galaxies at high redshifts\nwith wind speed v \u223c 1000 km/s and extending as far\nas hundreds of kpc [64], maybe up to \u2243 1 Mpc [65] (see\nRef. [66] for a review).\nGalactic winds are also a key ingredient for theoretical\nmodels which attempt at explaining the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium [59, 67, 68, 69]. At\nthe present time, it is not clear which galaxy type (if\nany) dominates the pollution. Starburst dwarf galaxies appear more akin at producing large winds, however\nthey also have a smaller gaseous content and a smaller\nenergetic reservoir. In the following, we use the most\nrecent simulations of Ref. [59] which detail the properties of galactic winds. This study shows that the\nnumber of wind-blowing galaxies is relatively insensitive\nto the stellar mass of the parent galaxy in the range\n108 M\u2299 . M\u2217 . 1010 M\u2299 as a result of the opposed\ninfluences of wind ram pressure and amount of infalling\nmaterial, and that this number falls at both ends of this\nmass range. At z \u2243 0 and in this mass range, the typical\nwind radius increases slowly with galaxy mass as follows:\nrgw \u2243 200 kpc for M\u2217 = 108 M\u2299 , rgw \u2243 800 kpc for\nM\u2217 = 109 M\u2299 , and rgw \u2243 1 Mpc for M\u2217 = 1010 M\u2299 .\n2\nOverall, the contribution ngw rgw\nwill be dominated by\ndwarf galaxies of stellar mass M\u2217 \u223c 109 M\u2299 . The number density ngw of galaxies surrounded by a wind at z = 0\ncan be derived from the filling factor fgw of the winds;\nunfortunately, this quantity appears to depend strongly\non the model, taking values between 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 and unity.\nThe median value corresponds to fgw = 0.1 \u2212 0.2, which\ngives a density ngw \u2243 fgw /Vgw \u2243 2. \u2212 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123 ,\n3\nwith Vgw = (4\u03c0/3)rgw\nthe wind volume. Note that this\nnumber is comparable to the number density of galaxies\nof stellar mass above 108 \u2212 109 M\u2299 . If the filling factor\nbecomes substantially larger, the galactic winds will overfill the filaments in which they reside, hence the filaments\nthemselves become the scattering centers.\nConcerning the strength of Bgw , Ref. [55] indicates\nthat most winds have a magnetic field with Bgw \u2243\n10\u22128 \u2212 10\u22127 G at z = 0, the range covering conservative\n\nClusters of galaxies are rare structures in the Universe, ncg \u2243 10\u22125 h370 Mpc\u22123 , but they are known to\nhost strong magnetic fields, with Bcg|c \u223c 1 \u2212 10 \u03bcG in\nthe innermost radius rcg|c \u223c 100 kpc [12, 71]. Measurements of the magnetic field in the cluster outskirts are\nrather scarce as a result of the smaller electron density\nand magnetic field strength. The minimum energy interpretation of recent synchrotron data nevertheless indicates that Bcg \u223c 1 \u03bcG out to rcg \u223c 1Mpc [72].\nTheoretical expectations tend to differ. For instance,\nRef. [40] shows that B varies with cluster mass, and indicates that for a massive cluster Bcg \u223c 1 \u03bcG within\nrcg \u2243 0.2 Mpc, then falls to Bcg \u223c 10\u22127 G within\nrcg \u2243 1 Mpc, Bcg \u223c 10\u22128 G within rcg \u2243 2 Mpc and\nfinally Bcg \u223c 10\u22129 G within rcg \u2243 4 \u2212 5 Mpc, while\nFig.5 of Ref. [73] indicates more extended magnetic fields,\nwith Bcg \u223c 1 \u03bcG within rcg \u2243 1 Mpc, then falls to\nBcg \u223c 10\u22127 G within rcg \u2243 3 Mpc, Bcg \u223c 10\u22128 G\nwithin rcg \u2243 4 Mpc and finally Bcg \u223c 10\u22129 G within\nrcg \u2243 5 Mpc. In the following, we take these two limits\nas a range for Bcg and rcg .\nNote that about half of galaxies lie outside of clusters,\nhence one can treat clusters of galaxies and the above\nfield radio ghosts and field galactic winds as distinct scattering centers.\n\n4.\n\nFilaments and walls of large scale structure\n\nFilaments or walls of large scale structure are not expected to be sources of magnetic pollution per se. However they may be pervaded with an average magnetic\nfield produced in the accretion shocks surrounding them\nor generated in and ejected by the galaxies they contain,\nprovided the filling factor of the resulting magnetic pollution in the filament/wall volume is of order unity. In\nthe following, we will consider both possibilities.\nIf, as before, the magnetic energy density in the filament/wall is a fraction \u01ebB of the thermal energy of the\nIGM, one infers a magnetic field strength:\nBf = 3.5\u00d710\n\n\u22128\n\nG\n\n\u0010 \u01eb \u00111/2 \u0012\nB\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c1f\n10h\u03c1b i\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nTf\n106 K\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\u03c1f and Tf denoting the filament baryonic density and temperature.\n\n\f5\nThe typical length scale of a filament is lf \u223c 15 Mpc,\nits radius rf \u223c 1 \u2212 2 Mpc, and the typical separation\nbetween two filaments df \u223c 25 Mpc [74].\nDuring the formation of non-linear structures, shock\nwaves develop as a consequence of the infall of material\non filaments, walls and clusters of galaxies. Numerical\nsimulations indicate that the typical radius of external\nshock waves around filament it is of the order of rsh \u2243 2\u2212\n3 Mpc [75, 76]; the typical velocity of these shock waves is\nof order vsh \u223c 300 \u2212 1000 km/s. Such shock waves have\nbeen proposed a site of magnetic field amplification (see\nfor instance [77]) and cosmic ray acceleration [78, 79, 80].\nIf the magnetic field in the shock wave vicinity corresponds to a fraction of equipartition with the shock\n2\nenergy density \u03c1vsh\n, one finds:\n\u00131/2\n\u0010 \u01eb \u00111/2 \u0012 \u03c1 \u00131/2 \u0012\nvsh\nB\next\n\u22127\nBsh \u2243 10 G\n.\n0.1\nh\u03c1b i\n1000 km/s\n(3)\nNote that \u03c1ext refers to the density of infalling material. The estimate \u01ebB \u223c 0.1 gives the right order of magnitude for the inferred value of magnetic field strength\n\u223c 100 \u03bcG in young supernovae remnants assuming a typical interstellar medium density and comparable shock\nspeed [81, 82].\nIf cosmic shock waves amplify the magnetic field up to\nthe value Bsh given above, one should then expect the\nfilament to be endowed with a significant fraction of Bsh\nout to the shock radius. In effect, the amount of matter\naccreted through the shock in a Hubble time in units of\nthe quantity of matter contained inside the structure at\nthe present time can be expressed as:\n\u03c1ext vsh H0\u22121\n\u03c1in\nrf\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nrf\n\u03c1f\nvsh\n(4)\n.\n\u223c 0.3\n1000 km/s\n2 Mpc\n10h\u03c1b i\n\nfacc \u2243\n\nNote that the estimate Bf given in Eq. (2) agrees with\nthat of Bsh to within a factor of a few (even though it\nwas derived through other means).\nB.\n\nOptical depth and last scattering surface for\ncosmic ray scattering\n\nDepending on the strength of the magnetic field in a\nhalo and its coherence length, the interaction of a particle may either lead to diffusion inside the structure, at\nsufficiently low energy, or to a weak deflection angle, at\nhigher energies. The details of the interaction between a\nparticle and a magnetized structure is described in detail\nin Appendix A.\n1.\n\nHomogeneously distributed scattering centers\n\nOut of simplicity, we first assume that the scattering\ncenters are distributed homogeneously in the Universe\n\nwith a typical mean free path to interaction di , where i\nrefers to the type of scattering center (e.g. magnetized\ngalactic wind, radio halo, filament ...). We will discuss in\nSection II C the influence of inhomogeneity on the conclusions of the discussion that follows. For scattering\ncenters of density ni and cross-section \u03c3i , di = (ni \u03c3i )\u22121 .\nThe mean free path to interaction with any scattering\ncenter is written d:\n1\n.\ni ni \u03c3i\n\n(5)\n\nd = P\n\nThe optical depth to ultrahigh energy cosmic ray scattering over a path length l is then defined as:\n\u03c4 =\n\nX\nl\nni \u03c3i .\n= l\nd\ni\n\n(6)\n\nTo make concrete estimates, assume that one type of\nscattering center dominates, with typical interaction\nlength di :\n\u03c4 \u2243 3.1\n\n\u0012\n\nl\n100 Mpc\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\ndi\n32 Mpc\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThe above fiducial value di = 32 Mpc corresponds to\nspherical scattering centers of density ni = 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123\nand radius ri = 1 Mpc; however it is also a typical value\nfor the interaction distance to filaments of the large scale\nstructure.\nThe above optical depth characterizes the number of\nscatterings along a path length l but it does not provide\ninformation on the angular spread of the cosmic ray image on the detector. Hence it is useful to introduce an\neffective optical depth \u03c4eff , which becomes unity when the\npath length l is such that the particle has suffered a deflection of order unity. If at each scattering, the squared\ndeflection is noted \u03b4\u03b8i2 , then the number of scatterings to\nachieve a deflection of order unity reads 1/\u03b4\u03b8i2 . The scattering length lscatt of cosmic rays in the medium, which\ncorresponds to the distance over which the deflection becomes of order unity, can be written as:\n1\n2 .\nn\ni i \u03c3i \u03b4\u03b8i\n\nlscatt = P\n\n(8)\n\nWe thus define the effective optical depth \u03c4eff as:\n\u03c4eff =\n\nl\nlscatt\n\n= l\n\nX\n\nni \u03c3i \u03b4\u03b8i2 .\n\n(9)\n\ni\n\nThe angular deflection can be expressed in a simple way\nas a function of the Larmor radius rL|i of the particle in\nstructure i, of the magnetic field coherence length \u03bbi of\nthis structure, and of the characteristic path length r\u0304i\nthrough the structure, which amounts to (\u03c0/2)rs for a\nsphere of radius rs or (\u03c0/2)2 rf for a filament of radius\nrf (see also Appendix A). Using the formula provided in\n\n\f6\nAppendix A [in particular Eq. (A3)], one can rewrite the\neffective optical depth as:\n\u03c4eff \u2243 l\n\nX\ni\n\nni \u03c3i\n\n1+\n\n2\n2rL|i\n\nr\u0304i \u03bbi\n\n!\u22121\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nObviously, one always has \u03c4eff < \u03c4 . One should interpret the two optical depths as follows: \u03c4 < 1 (which\nimplies \u03c4eff < 1) means that the Universe is transparent\nto cosmic ray scattering on the scale l, while \u03c4 > \u03c4eff > 1\nmeans that the Universe is opaque over this scale, i.e.\nthe accumulated angular deflection is greater than unity.\nThe intermediate regime, \u03c4 > 1 > \u03c4eff is interesting; it\ncorresponds to a translucent situation in which cosmic\nrays suffer one to many scatterings but the accumulated\nangular deflection remains smaller than unity.\nThe phenomenology of the cosmic ray signal on the detector then depends on the typical source distance, which\nshould be used for l, as well as on the characteristics of\nthe scattering agents described above. Assuming rectilinear propagation of the particles, the source distance\nscale is of order lmax , the maximal distance that a particle of energy E can travel without loosing its energy.\nIndeed, if the source population is continously emitting\nand homogeneous (the latter being a good approximation\non scales beyond a few hundred Mpc), the flux F (< l) received from sources located within a distance l increases\nas l:\nF (< l) = ns \u1e44UHECR l ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere ns denotes the source density and \u1e44UHECR the\nnumber of cosmic rays emitted by a source per unit time.\nIn the case of bursting sources, one finds the same scaling\n(see Ref. [14]):\nF (< l) = \u1e45s NUHECR l .\n\n(12)\n\nIn this equation, \u1e45s should now be understood as the rate\nof bursting sources per unit time and unit volume, and\nNUHECR as the total number of cosmic rays emitted by\na source.\nHence in both cases, most of the flux comes from\nsources located at distance of order lmax . In the following, we therefore substitute lmax for l in the expression\nof the optical depth. We will discuss apart the particular case of rare close-by sources. One can evaluate the\ndistance lmax in two ways: either as the energy loss dis\u22121\ntance E | dE/dx| , or as the maximal distance that a\nparticle can travel, assuming it has been detected with\nenergy E and the maximal energy at the source is Emax .\nIn the following, we use this latter definition and assume\nEmax = 4 \u00d7 1020 eV. The two definitions give values that\nnever differ by more than 40% however, over the energy\nrange 1017 eV \u2192 1020 eV.\nIf particles diffuse rather than travel rectilinearly,\nthe\n\u221a\nmaximum distance is instead determined by 2Dtmax ,\nwhere D denotes the diffusion coefficient and tmax =\n\nlmax /c. This will be discussed in more detail in Section III C 2.\nWe may now plot the optical depths to scattering \u03c4 and\n\u03c4eff as functions of energy. In Fig. 1, we show an example that ignores all scattering centers except magnetized\ngalactic winds, for which we assume ngw = 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123 ,\nrgw = 0.8 Mpc, Bgw = 3 * 10\u22128 G and \u03bbgw = 0.05 Mpc.\nThe resulting optical depth \u03c4 is shown as the dashed\n(blue) line, and the effective optical depth \u03c4eff as the\nsolid (red) line. The dependence of \u03c4 on E actually reveals the dependence of lmax on E: lmax decreases sharply\nbeyond a few 1019 eV as a consequence of pion production on the microwave background. The dependence of\n\u03c4eff on E is even more pronounced, since the number of\nscatterings to achieve deflection of order unity rapidly increases with energy, roughly as E 2 beyond 1018 eV here\n[see Eq. (10)]. The horizontal dotted line indicates an\noptical depth of order unity, while the vertical dotted\nlines indicate at which energy \u03c4eff = 1 and \u03c4 = 1 respectively, from left to right. As indicated on the figure, these\nlines delimit the energy ranges in which the Universe appears opaque, translucent or transparent to cosmic ray\nscattering. Interestingly, for this example, the Universe\nis translucent at energies close to the threshold for pion\nproduction EGZK \u2243 6 * 1019 eV [83, 84].\nIn Figure 2, we show the optical depths for the various\ntypes of scattering centers, taken in turn, and for two sets\nof parameters defining their characteristics, as indicated\nin the caption. In principle, one should of course sum the\ndifferent optical depths of the types of scattering centers.\nIf, however, the pollution of magnetized winds and radio\nhalos permeate the filaments and nothing else, one should\nof course only consider the filaments as the sole scattering\nagents.\nThe two quantities lscatt and d are shown together with\nthe maximal path length (or source distance scale) lmax in\nFig. 3 for magnetized galactic winds as scattering agents,\nwith the same parameters used to construct Fig. 1. Figure 3 illustrates in a different way the opaque, translucent or transparent nature of the Universe to cosmic ray\nscattering.\nOne may also draw the analog of Fig. 2 for the distance\nto the last scattering surface d for the different types of\nscattering centers, as done in Fig. 4.\n\nC.\n\nInhomogeneity of the large scale structure Analytic discussion\n\nThe above results should be corrected for the presence of inhomogeneity when the distances considered are\nsmaller than the inhomogeneity length 100 Mpc. In a\nfirst approach, one may assume that all scattering centers are clustered in the filaments of large scale structure.\nThis affects transport in two ways: the typical distance\nto an interaction becomes of order df rather than di , but\nthe typical deflection may be enhanced, as the probability of hitting more than one scattering center during the\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 1: Optical depth to cosmic ray scattering by magnetized\ngalactic winds, with ngw = 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123 , Bgw = 3 * 10\u22128 G,\n\u03bbgw = 50 kpc, and rgw = 0.8 Mpc. Solid line: optical depth\n\u03c4eff to scattering by an angle of order unity, as defined in\nEq. (10); dashed line: optical depth \u03c4 as defined in Eq. (6).\nIn the energy range where \u03c4 > \u03c4eff > 1, the Universe is\nopaque up to the energy loss distance ; in the range where\n\u03c4 > 1 > \u03c4eff , the Universe is translucent on this distance scale,\nmeaning that cosmic rays suffer several to many scatterings\nbut the total angular deflection remains below unity; finally,\nat energies where 1 > \u03c4 > \u03c4eff , the Universe is transparent to\ncosmic ray scattering.\n\ninteraction with a filament is itself increased.\nAs the density of scattering centers in a filament becomes ni|f = ni /ff , where ff \u223c 5 % is the average filament filling factor in the Universe, the mean free path to\ninteraction inside a filament becomes ff di . Consequently,\nthe average number of interactions Nint|f with scattering\ncenters of type i during the ballistic crossing of a filament\nof radius rf is:\nNint|f =\n\nr \u0304f\n,\nff di\n\n(13)\n\nwhere r \u0304f is the characteristic path length of the particle through the filament [see the discussion that follows\nEq. (9) and Appendix A]. This formula assumes that\nthe particle suffers a deflection angle much smaller than\nunity at each interaction. The particle thus exits the filament with a total deflection and time delay (with respect\nto straight line crossing):\n2\n\u03b4\u03b8i|f\n= Nint|f \u03b4\u03b8i2 ,\n2\n\u03b4ti|f = Nint|f \u03b4ti + \u03b4\u03b8i|f\n\n(14)\nr \u0304f\n.\n6c\n\n(15)\n\nIn these equations, \u03b4\u03b8i and \u03b4ti denote respectively the\ndeflection angle and time delay consecutive to an interaction with scattering center of type i, as discussed in\n\nFIG. 2: Optical depth to cosmic ray scattering for different types of scattering agents and for two different sets of\nparameters in each case.

(17)\n2 Mpc\n0.05\n32 Mpc\n\nas the denominator in this expression represents the\nprobability of hitting a scattering center when the particle hits a filament. The quantities di,f , \u03b4\u03b8i|f and \u03b4ti|f\nsuffice in principle to characterize the transport of the\nparticle in this structured Universe and to derive the\nphenomenological consequences with respect to experimental data. To gauge the influence of the geometry,\none should compare the above quantities to those expected for a homogeneous scattering center distribution\n\nFor the fiducial values used in Eq. (17), fi /ff = 0.83, i.e.\nthe halos barely overfill the filaments. This means that\nif ri or ni is larger than the quoted values, one must consider that the scattering centers are the filaments themselves, with the average quantities df , rf and Bf discussed\npreviously. Conversely, if ri or ni is smaller, one must follow the above multiple interaction scheme.\nFinally, one can verify that on distance scales \u226b df ,\nthe number of interactions (hence the angular deflection\n\ndi,f\n\ndf\n\u2243\n,\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212Nint|f )\n\n\f9\nand time delay) converge toward those obtained in the\nhomogeneous case (at least for rectilinear propagation).\nIn effect, the filling factor of filaments can be written\nin terms of rf and df as ff \u2243 (\u03c0/2)rf /df , hence over a\nlength scale d, the particle suffers Nint|f d/df \u2243 d/di interactions. Qualitatively, the number of interactions per\nfilament crossing compensates for the different distance\nbetween two zones of interaction (i.e. filaments). The\neffect of clustering of the scattering centers should thus\nbe important on distance scales . 100 \u2212 200 Mpc, since\nthe distance between two filaments is of order 30 Mpc;\nbeyond that distance, one can use the results derived in\nthe homogeneous limit (Section II B 1).\nOne cannot exclude a priori that an even more realistic description of the hierarchical clustering of matter\nwould produce a sophisticated law of probability for the\ninteraction path length, leading to non-standard effects\nsuch as anomalous diffusion. A more realistic description should also account for more complex distribution\nlaws for the scattering center parameters. Monte Carlo\nsimulations of particle propagation in a \"realistic\" scattering center distribution are best suited to address such\nissues and to provide quantitative estimates of the effect\nof inhomogeneity on the transport.\nIn the following section, we describe the simulations we\nhave performed in order to study the influence of a realistic spatial distribution of scattering centers. In view of\nthe uncertainties surrounding the origin of extragalactic\nmagnetic fields and the parameters describing the scattering centers, we simply describe these latter with average values, as discussed in Section II.\n\nD.\n\nInhomogeneity of the large scale structure Numerical simulations\n\nWe have performed our simulations using a variant of\nthe numerical code described in Ref. [46]. The simulation of the dark matter density field has been produced\nby the RAMSES code [85], and was kindly provided to us by\nS. Colombi; its characteristics are 2563 cells, with extent\n280 Mpc, giving a grid size 1.1 Mpc. For each simulation,\nwe sample a population of scattering centers. We adopt\ntwo physically motivated bias models: in the first model,\nthe scattering center density is proportional to the dark\nmatter density field; in the second, the same proportionality applies, but we do not allow scattering centers to\nreside in regions with dark matter density \u03c1 < 0.5h\u03c1i.\nThis latter model enhances the segregation of scattering\ncenters in the large scale structure.\nFigure 5 shows an example of a scattering center distribution in a two-dimensional slice of the simulation box\nin the first bias model. The segregation of scattering centers in filaments of the large scale structure is apparent,\nalthough some tend to reside in smaller density regions\nas a result of the large volume fraction occupied by such\nregions. Out of simplicity, each scattering center is modelled as a cube of the size of a cell of the simulation;\n\nFIG. 5: Distribution of scattering centers in the large scale\nstructure (in white), in a model in which the density of scattering centers follows that of dark matter (density contrast\nrepresented in colors). The thickness of this slice is 1.1 Mpc.\nThe average density is 10\u22122 Mpc\u22123 .\n\neach cell in the simulation is thus occupied by zero or\none scattering center.\nWe then follow the trajectories of cosmic rays of various energies, using the method of Ref. [46], which simulates the transport of particles across cells of coherence of\nthe magnetic field in both the diffusive and non-diffusive\nregime. These simulations allow to compute the various\nstatistical properties of transport. A first effect brought\nto light by these simulations is the general increase in\nthe length of first interaction in the inhomogeneous case,\nwhen compared to the homogeneous scattering center\ndistribution. This increase is of order 40% for the first\nbias model, and about 60% for the second bias model.\nIt does not seem to depend strongly on the scattering\ncenter density.\nAnother significant effect is related to the source environment. If this latter is dense, as one might expect,\nthe local scattering center density is higher than average, and therefore the cosmic ray may experience several interactions in the source environment in the first\nmegaparsecs. Accordingly, the probability distribution\nfor the first interaction departs from a simple exponential law: it exhibits a peak in the first Mpc, then decreases as an exponential. These extra interactions will\nnot affect strongly the total deflection angle as seen from\nthe detector, since 1 Mpc seen from 100 Mpc is subtended by an angle 0.6\u25e6 . The time delay associated\nto this displacement is relatively small, being of order\n\u2243 r\u03b4 2 /(2c) \u2243 180 yr (r/1 Mpc)(\u03b4/0.6\u25e6 )2 (r denotes here\n\n\f10\nthe size of the structure in which the source is embedded,\nand \u03b4 the deflection angle associated to the displacement\nwithin this structure).\nThis effect is apparent in Fig. 6 which shows the average number of interactions as a function of distance, for\ndifferent energies. The dashed lines indicate the corresponding trends for a homogeneous scattering distribution, which go to zero when the traveled distance tends\nto zero. On the contrary, the solid lines, which correspond to the simulated inhomogeneous case, depart from\nthis scaling and indicate a fixed number of interactions, of\norder 2. The exact number turns out to depend on the environment density and has a variance of order unity. For\na source in an environment of average density, the number of such extra interactions in the source surroundings\nis negligible.\n\nFIG. 6: Average number of interactions with scattering centers as a function of distance traveled in a time tmax (E).\nFrom top to bottom, solid lines correspond to different energies (in increasing order), as indicated in the colored version. Dashed lines indicate the numerical results for a homogeneous scattering center population, while solid lines correspond to the inhomogeneous case for which the scattering\ncenters are distributed according to the dark matter density.\nThe dotted line indicates the analytical homogeneous result\nfor non-diffusive propagation. The scattering center density\nis such that di = 32 Mpc. Each scattering center is endowed\nwith a magnetic field Bi = 3 * 10\u22128 G and coherence length\n\u03bbi = 100 kpc (due to the cubic geometry of the scattering center, this corresponds to Bi = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 G and \u03bbi = 100 kpc\nin a spherical cell of radius 1 Mpc).\n\nFigure 6 also reveals other interesting features. In\nparticular, one can see clearly that the average number\nof interactions in the inhomogeneous case converges toward that obtained in the homogeneous case on distance\n\nscales & 100 \u2212 200 Mpc, as expected [see the discussion\nthat follows Eq. (17)]. For the highest energies, namely\nE = 1019.7 eV and E = 1020 eV, there is a slight offset\nbetween the analytical prediction for di and the homogeneous calculation; this difference is attributed to the cubic geometry of the scattering center. Particles of lower\nenergies, in particular E = 1019 eV, diffuse in the scattering center distribution, as evidenced by the higher slope\nof the average number of interactions as a function of\nthe traveled distance l. One can check in particular that\nNint \u223c (l/di )2 as expected. At very large distances, this\nrelation breaks down because the trajectory is cut after a\ntime tmax ; hence less and less particles are able to travel\n1/2\nbeyond a distance \u223c (ctmax )1/2 di . Similar features are\nobserved in the second bias model.\nFinally, the same simulations can be used to compute\nthe average deflection angle as a function of energy and\ntraveled distance. This calculation is performed as follows. At a predetermined distance l, one draws at random a certain number of \"small spheres\" positioned on\nthe sphere of radius l around the source. These \"small\nspheres\" mimic the detectors located at distance l from\nthe source. There must be a sufficient number of these\n\"small spheres\" to guarantee a sufficient signal, but not\nso many that they would overlap, in which case one would\noversample the sphere of radius l. Each time a trajectory\nintersects one of these spheres, the angle between the\nparticle incoming direction in this sphere and the source\nlocation is recorded. Iterating over the particles and the\n\"small spheres\" allows to reconstruct the probability distribution of deflection angles.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 7 for various energies, for\nthe same inhomogeneous distribution of scattering centers as above. Each cell is endowed with a magnetic field\nof strength Bi = 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 G and of coherence length\n\u03bbi = 100 kpc. Since the cell is cubic, of size 1.1 Mpc, the\ndeflection per interaction corresponds to that obtained\nfor a spherical cell of radius 1 Mpc and magnetic field\nstrength Bi = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 G. The values shown in Fig. 7\nhave been computed at the following distances: 1000 Mpc\nfor E = 1019 eV, 600 Mpc for E = 1019.3 eV, 400 Mpc\nfor E = 1019.7 eV and 90 Mpc for E = 1020 eV. These\ndistances are representative of lmax hence of the source\ndistance scale. At an energy E = 1020 eV, the mean and\nmedian deflections are of order 3\u25e6 and 2.6\u25e6 respectively,\nwhile at E = 1019.7 eV, they increase to 12\u25e6 and 11.5\u25e6 ,\nand become larger at smaller energies. These values are\nabout 30% smaller than those expected from the analytical calculation, given in Eq. (21) further below. This\ndifference can stem from the slightly different number\nof interactions experienced by particles in the inhomogeneous scattering center distribution, as compared to the\nhomogeneous case (see Fig. 7). The cubic geometry of\nscattering centers used in our simulation can also contribute to alter the values of the deflection angles. Obviously, these deflections could also be larger or smaller\ndepending on the exact values of the scattering center\ncharacteristics, see discussion above.\n\n\f11\nIII.\n\nCONSEQUENCES FOR COSMIC RAY\nTRANSPORT\n\nIn this section, we discuss the phenomenological consequences of the above model of cosmic ray transport\nwith respect to the signatures of different source models,\ndiscussing in particular the absence or existence of counterparts. We will discuss in Section IV the interpretation\nof existing data in the light of these consequences, and in\nparticular the recent correlation announced by the Pierre\nAuger Observatory.\n\nA.\n\nFIG. 7: Histogram of deflection for different energies, as indicated. The values have been computed at different distances\nfor the different energies: 1000 Mpc for E = 1019 eV, 600 Mpc\nfor E = 1019.3 eV, 400 Mpc for E = 1019.7 eV and 90 Mpc\nfor E = 1020 eV. As before, the scattering center density is\nsuch that di = 32 Mpc. Each scattering center is endowed\nwith a magnetic field Bi = 3 * 10\u22128 G and coherence length\n\u03bbi = 100 kpc (due to the cubic geometry of the scattering center, this corresponds to Bi = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 G and \u03bbi = 100 kpc\nin a spherical cell of radius 1 Mpc).\n\nTo summarize this discussion on the effect of inhomogeneity, we note the following features: when the scattering centers correlate with the large scale structure,\nthe probability law of first interaction and the number\nof interactions departs from those obtained in the homogeneous case, at distances . 100 Mpc. The difference\nbetween the two cases depends on several factors: the\nsource environment and the bias of the scattering center\ndistribution with respect to the underlying dark matter\ndistribution, in particular. It is found however that on\nlarge scales & 100 Mpc and in the weak deflection regime,\none recovers the results of the homogeneous scattering\ncenter distribution discussed in Section II B 1.\nExtra interactions in the source environment, if sufficiently dense to be populated by scattering centers, may\nincrease slightly the time delay with respect to straight\nline propagation but will not modify substantially the\ntotal deflection angle. In the diffusive regime, scattering\noccurs against filaments if the interaction length in the\nfilament is smaller than the filament size, or against the\nscattering centers, if not.\n\nOptically thin regime\n\nThe optically thin regime, in which lmax < d < lscatt ,\nis trivial in terms of particle propagation: most particles travel in straight line, without interacting in the intergalactic medium, hence one should expect to see the\nsource directly in the arrival direction of the highest energy events. However, in the case of gamma-ray burst\nsources, the spreading of arrival times through the interaction with cosmic magnetic fields is essential to reconcile\nthe gamma-ray burst rate with the rate of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray detection [86]. In the absence of scattering (hence time delay), such a bursting source would be\nessentially unobservable as the occurrence rate is much\ntoo low when compared to the lifetime of the experiment.\nIndependently of the source scenario, there does not\nexist at present clear and unique evidence for counterpart\nidentification, as discussed briefly in the introduction.\nExtra deflection could arise from an all-pervading intergalactic magnetic field or the Galactic magnetic field.\nThe influence of an all-pervading intergalactic magnetic\nfield has been discussed in previous works, see for instance Refs. [40, 41, 45, 51] for recent works. Note that\nour model of magnetized filaments and non-magnetized\nvoids may be considered as an approximation to the more\nrealistic magnetic field configurations derived in these\nstudies.\nConcerning the influence of the Galactic magnetic field,\nexisting models suggest that the typical deflection at the\nhighest energies, say \u2243 1020 eV, are probably of the order\nof a few degrees [87, 88]. Hence one would need to invoke\nthe existence of an extended magnetized halo to provide\nsufficient deflection. Alternatively, one may consider a\nscenario in which most particles at the highest energies\nare heavy nuclei, which are more easily deflected.\n\nB.\n\nTranslucent regime\n\nThe intermediate regime, in which d < lmax < lscatt\nis interesting, because the typical deflection is smaller\nthan unity, yet it could be sufficient to explain the lack\nof counterpart.\n\n\f12\n1.\n\nTransport\n\nSince the total deflection remains smaller than unity,\none may describe the transport as near-ballistic with a\nnon-zero time delay as measured relatively to straight\nline propagation. Furthermore, one may use in this case\nthe time delay and deflection formulae obtained from random walk arguments in Ref. [14], provided one accounts\nfor the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. In detail,\nat each scattering with scattering center i, the particle\nsuffers and angular deflection \u03b4\u03b8i and exits with a delay\n\u03b4ti . The corresponding formulae for \u03b4\u03b8i and \u03b4ti are given\nin Eqs. (A4),(A6).\nThe total time delay \u03b4t acquired over a path length l\nis given by the sum of the time delays acquired during\neach scattering as well as that resulting from the fact\nthat the particle does not travel in a straight line from\nthe source to the detector. If the particle is seen from\nthe detector at a typical deflection angle \u03b4\u03b1 away from\nthe source direction, then the time delay associated to\nthis transverse displacement with respect to the line of\nsight is l\u03b4\u03b12 /(4c) [89]. In the limit of large optical depth\n\u03c4 > 1, this angle \u03b4\u03b12 is written as [89]:\n\u03b4\u03b12 =\n\n\u03c4 2\n\u03b4\u03b8 ,\n3 i\n\n2.\n\nwhere\nis the rms scattering angle per scattering event.\nOn average, the particle interacts at every step of\nlength d, with probability d/di of hitting a structure of\ntype i. Then the total time delay and deflection acquired\nafter traveling a path length l are:\n\u03c4 X d 2\n\u03b4\u03b8 ,\n3 i di i\n\n\u03b4t \u2243 \u03c4\n\n(19)\n\nX d\nl\u03b4\u03b12\n\u03b4ti +\n.\ndi\n4c\ni\n\n(20)\n\nTo make simple estimates, consider the case in which one\ntype of scattering event dominates the scattering history.\nThen the typical deflection angle reads (still assuming\n\u03c4 > 1):\n\u03b4\u03b1 \u2243 1.7\u25e6\n\u0012\n\n\u0010 \u03c4 \u00111/2 \u0012\n3\n\nBi\n10\u22128 G\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nr\u0304i\n2 Mpc\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03bbi\n0.1 Mpc\n\nThe second term on the r.h.s of Eq. (20) indeed dominates largely over the first. It is easy to verify that the\nrelation between \u03b4\u03b12 (the rms angle between the line of\nsight to the source and the particle incoming velocity on\nthe detector) and \u03b4\u03b82 (the rms velocity deflection angle\nper scattering) remains unchanged in the limit \u03c4 < 1.\nObviously, however, the solid angle of the source images\ncannot exceed that of the scattering center.\nFurther effects related to the formation of angular images are discussed in the following.\n\n(18)\n\n\u03b4\u03b8i2\n\n\u03b4\u03b12 =\n\nhighly magnetized regions, and as such are probably associated with active objects such as radio-galaxies, one\nmay be deceived by their presence on the line of sight, and\ninterpret them as the source of ultrahigh energy cosmic\nrays. The smoking gun of such counterfeiting is the distance scale to these objects: in this optically thick regime,\nmost counterparts would be located at a distance scale\nd (which can be measured) significantly smaller than the\nexpected distance scale lmax (which is known).\nThe associated time delay reads:\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u03b4\u03b1\nl\n.\n(22)\n\u03b4t \u2243 7.0 * 104 yrs\n100 Mpc\n1.7\u25e6\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nE\n1020 eV\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n(21)\n,\n\nwhere r\u0304i is the characteristic size of the scattering center\n[see after Eq. (9) and Appendix A]. The optical depth\nto cosmic ray scattering is related to the distance and\nthe geometrical characteristics of the scattering centers\nas in Eq. (7). This deflection may thus be non-negligible\nfor typical parameters of the scattering centers discussed\nin the previous section. In all cases, the arrival direction should point back to the last scattering center encountered by the cosmic ray. Since scattering centers are\n\nAngular images\n\nThe physics of the formation of angular images has\nbeen discussed in detail in Refs. [14, 16] in the case\nof ultrahigh energy cosmic rays propagating in an allpervading irregular magnetic field. In the model under\nconsideration, differences may occur when the discreteness of scattering centers cannot be neglected. This occurs if \u03c4 . 1, since \u03c4 indicates the covering factor of the\nscattering centers.\nIn the limit \u03c4 \u226b 1, one may use the analysis of\nRefs. [14, 16] provided one translates the quantities defined in these studies in terms of those relevant in the\npresent case, such the scattering rate per interaction determined in Section A. One point of interest concerns the\nshape of the angular image. As discussed in Refs. [14, 16],\nthe image will be centered on the source, and broadened\nby an angle \u03b4\u03b1, if there are many uncorrelated paths\nthrough the scattering medium linking the source to the\ndetector. In the present case, this condition remains unchanged in the limit \u03c4 \u226b 1, i.e. it reads l\u03b4\u03b1 \u226b \u03bbi , with\n\u03bbi the magnetic field coherence length of the scattering\ncenter. If l\u03b4\u03b1 \u226a \u03bbi , the image will appear displaced\nfrom the true source position by an angle \u03b4\u03b1, with a\nsmall dispersion. As discussed in Ref. [16], the distortion\nof the image does not modify (on average) the flux received from the source, in either limit considered above.\nThis implies in particular that the presence of scattering\ncenters does not modify the expected number of events,\nbut only modifies the angular disposition of these multiple events.\nThe intermediate regime l\u03b4\u03b1 \u2243 \u03bbi is that were multiple images and magnetic lensing amplification effects may\n\n\f13\nbecome prominent (see Ref. [90] for a numerical demonstration of magnetic lensing). However, as \u03bbi is unlikely\nto exceed a few hundreds of kpc, this intermediate regime\nis to be expected only in the limit of very small deflection:\nl\u03b4\u03b1\n\u2243 29\n\u03bbi\n\n\u0012\n\nl\n100 Mpc\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03b4\u03b1\n1.7\u25e6\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03bbi\n100 kpc\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nThis equation indeed suggests that typical angular images should be broadened by \u03b4\u03b1 and centered on the\nsource location.\nIn the limit of small optical depth (\u03c4 \u223c 1) which\nbecomes all the more relevant at the highest energies\nE \u223c 1020 eV, some noticeable differences can be expected. Two questions of interest are: the shape of angular images, and the possible magnification or demagnification of images. As we argue, these effects depend on\nthe hierarchy between the typical displacement \u2243 l\u03b4\u03b1\nin the scattering center plane (oriented perpendicular to\nthe line of sight to the source), the size of the scattering\ncenter ri , as well as the typical distance between two scattering centers in this plane, which is given by (ni l)\u22121/2 .\nOut of simplicity, we assume spherical scattering centers;\nwe will argue that the conclusions remain unchanged for\nfilaments.\nIn order to study the limit \u03c4 . 1, it suffices to assume\nthat there is only one scattering center on the line of\nsight to the source. We further assume that this scattering structure is centered on the line of sight. The shape\nof the angular image is here as well determined by the ratio l\u03b4\u03b1i /\u03bbi . As we now argue, the flux received does not\ndeviate from that expected in the absence of scattering,\nF0 = \u1e44UHECR /(4\u03c0l2 ), provided the scattering center is\nlarger than the image of the source, i.e. \u03b4\u03b2i > \u03b4\u03b1i ,\ndenoting by \u03b4\u03b2i \u2261 ri /l1 the typical apparent half opening angle of the scattering center with l1 the distance\nbetween the scattering center and the detector. If the\nopposite inequality holds (\u03b4\u03b2i < \u03b4\u03b1i ), the flux from the\nsource gets demagnified through scattering. This can be\nseen as follows.\nEach area element on the scattering structure can be\nassumed to dilute an incoming unidirectional flux into a\nbeam of solid angle \u03b4\u03a9 \u2243 \u03c0\u03b4\u03b8i2 (assuming small deflection). As seen from the source, this defines a solid angle\n\u03b4\u03a9|s such that, if particles are emitted within \u03b4\u03a9|s , they\nmay be redirected toward the detector through scattering. Then:\n\u03b4\u03a9|s =\n\n\u0012 \u00132\nl1\n\u03b4\u03a9\nl\n\n(24)\n\nThe ratio l1 /l corresponds to the ratio between the halfopening angle of the cone of solid angle \u03b4\u03a9|s to \u03b4\u03b8i . Effects related to the finite size of the scattering center are\nconsidered further below.\nNow, of the flux impinging on the area element, only a\nfraction \u03b4\u03a9d /\u03b4\u03a9 is diverted away toward the detector of\nsolid angle \u03b4\u03a9d = Ad /l12 and area Ad (this solid angle is\n\nmeasured relative to the scattering structure). One then\nfinds that the flux received from the source is:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u1e44UHECR \u03b4\u03a9d\n\u03c0r2\nF =\nmin \u03b4\u03a9|s , 2i\n4\u03c0Ad \u03b4\u03a9\nl\n\" \u0012 \u0013\n# 2\n2\n2\nl\nri\n= F0 min 1,\n.\n(25)\nl1\nl22 \u03b4\u03b8i2\nIn this equation, l2 \u2261 l \u2212 l1 represents the distance between the source and the scattering center. The \"min\"\nfunction has been introduced in order to limit the angular size of the source image to the minimum of the size\nproduced by deflection and the size of the scattering center (which is seen through a solid angle \u03c0ri2 /l22 from the\nsource).\nThus, F = F0 if the solid angle \u03b4\u03a9|s is smaller than the\nsolid angle of the scattering structure as seen from the\nsource, which amounts to \u03b4\u03b1i < \u03b4\u03b2i . This can be traced\nback to the compensation between a larger source image\n(which would lead to amplification) with the dilution of\nthe signal into a beam of solid angle \u03b4\u03a9.\nIf, on the contrary \u03b4\u03b1i > \u03b4\u03b2i , the source image is\ndemagnified by the ratio F/F0 \u2243 \u03b4\u03b2i2 /\u03b4\u03b12i , i.e. by the\nratio of the solid angle of the scattering center to the solid\nangle that the source image would have if the scattering\ncenter had an infinite extent. One can generalize this\nresult to the case of filamentary scattering centers, by\nnoting that the flux gets demagnified by the ratio of the\narea of the scattering center to the projected area (on the\nscattering plane) of the beam of solid angle \u03b4\u03a9|s . Using\nprevious fiducial values for the scattering centers, and\nassuming l2 = l/2, one finds:\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03b4\u03b1i\nri\nl\n\u03b4\u03b1i\n. (26)\n\u2243 0.8\n\u03b4\u03b2i\n1\u25e6\n100 Mpc\n1 Mpc\nHowever, this result considers only the influence of one\nscattering center on the line of sight. As the beam width\nexceeds the apparent size of the scattering center on the\nline of sight, one must take into account the possibility that a fraction of the beam interacts with scattering centers away from the line of sight. In the limit of\nsmall angle deflection, and still assuming \u03b4\u03b1i > \u03b4\u03b2i , the\nflux received by the detector should be given by Eq. (25)\nabove, multiplied by the number of scattering centers\nof the scattering plane intercepted by the beam of solid\nangle \u03b4\u03a9|s . We neglect the possible overlap of the projected areas of the scattering centers, which corresponds\nto (ni l)\u22121/2 > ri , or equivalently \u03c4 < 1. This number of\nintercepted scattering structures can then be written as:\nNi \u2243 ni ll22 \u03b4\u03a9|s\n\u0012\n\u00133 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u0013\u0012\nni\n\u03b4\u03b1i\nl\n\u2248 0.96\n(27)\n.\n100 Mpc\n1\u25e6\n10\u22122 Mpc\u22123\nHence the flux received from all intercepted scattering\ncenters in the limit \u03b4\u03b1i > \u03b4\u03b2i is:\nFtot \u2243 Ni F \u2243 \u03c4 F0 .\n\n(28)\n\n\f14\nThis result can be understood as follows: the number of\nintercepted scattering centers is the product of the surface density ni l times the projected area (on the scattering plane) of the beam of solid angle \u03b4\u03a9|s ; however, the\ndemagnification factor is the ratio of the scattering center area to this latter, so that the total demagnification\nfactor is the product of the surface density of scattering\ncenters times the area of one scattering center, i.e. \u03c4 .\nThis argument remains unchanged for filamentary scattering centers.\nEquation (28) gives the total demagnification of the\nflux from a source with one scattering structure on the\nline of sight, in the limits \u03b4\u03b1i > \u03b4\u03b2i and (ni l)\u22121/2 > ri\n(i.e. \u03c4 < 1). Interestingly, the angular image is now\ndecomposed into Ni distinct images of angular size \u03b4\u03b2i\neach, of similar flux \u223c F0 \u03c4 /Ni , being separated from one\nanother by an angle of order \u03b4\u03b1i .\nNote that, on average, there is neither magnification\nnor demagnification of the flux, as expected. Regarding\nthe limit \u03c4 \u226b 1, this effect has been discussed in Ref. [16]\nin particular. Concerning the limit \u03c4 < 1 discussed\nabove, there are two possibilities. If \u03b4\u03b1i < \u03b4\u03b2i , then\nas shown in Eq. (25) the flux is unchanged through scattering. If \u03b4\u03b1i > \u03b4\u03b2i , the flux of the source is demagnified\nby \u03c4 through scattering, but this occurs with probability\n\u2243 \u03c4 , which corresponds to the possibility of having one\nscattering structure on the line of sight. There is also a\nprobability 1 \u2212 \u03c4 of seeing the source directly (without\nscattering) together with echoes of flux \u03c4 F0 associated\nto scattering with structures off the line of sight. Hence\nthe total flux is on average unchanged. Deviations from\nthis average may occur in certain configurations, for instance through magnetic lensing, see Eq. (23) above and\nRef. [16], or in particular source scenarios, as discussed\nat the end of Section III B 5 further below.\n\n3.\n\nExperimental signatures for continuously emitting\nsources\n\nAs far as continuously emitting sources are concerned,\na possibly large angular deflection could prevent the detection of counterparts. Indeed, values such as di =\n30 Mpc and Bi = 10\u22128 G suffice to produce a deflection of\norder 10\u25e6 over a path length l = lmax at energy 4*1019 eV,\nwhich is a generic threshold energy used in the search for\ncounterparts. The strong evolution of \u03b4\u03b8 with energy results from the strong evolution of lmax with E close to\nthe threshold for pion production. This suggests that\ncounterparts should be found at sufficiently high energies, which of course asks for high statistics.\nSince the flux received from sources within distance\nl scales as l, one may expect to see the source in the\narrival directions of a subset l0 /lmax of all events, l0 being defined as the distance at which the typical deflection becomes comparable to the radius within which one\nsearches for counterparts. This number l0 /lmax should\nbe smaller than unity, since if it were unity, it would\n\nmean that the total angular deflection for all sources is\nvery small, hence that counterparts should have been detected.\n4.\n\nExperimental signatures for bursting sources\n\nRegarding bursting sources, and gamma-ray bursts in\nparticular, Eq. (22) shows that the typical time delay is\nsufficiently large to explain the lack of temporal association between cosmic ray arrival directions and gammaray bursts, as well as the continuous rate of detection of\nhigh energy cosmic rays. Recall indeed that one potential difficulty of the gamma-ray burst scenario is to explain the near continuous detection of cosmic rays at the\nhighest energies \u223c 1020 eV, when the gamma-ray burst\nrate is only \u223c 10\u22123 yr\u22121 within the energy loss distance\n\u223c 100 Mpc. As noted by Waxman [86], this difficulty may\nbe overcome if the arrival time spread \u03c3t of the highest\nenergy events is sufficiently large, i.e. \u03c3t & 103 yr at\n1020 eV in particular.\nFollowing Ref. [14], we note that the magnitude of\n\u03c3t /\u03b4t is influenced by the number of different trajectories\nthat the particle can follow from the source to the detector. If indeed all particles follow the very same trajectory,\n\u03c3t \u226a \u03b4t, while if different particles may follow different\ntrajectories, one should expect \u03c3t \u223c \u03b4t. In the present\nmodel, Eq. (23) shows that the latter situation is much\nmore likely, so that \u03c3t /\u03b4t \u223c 1. Furthermore, broadening\nof the time signal at the highest energies is likely to be\nincreased by stochastic pion production, which results in\n\u03c3t /\u03b4t \u223c 1 [23].\nOne may also calculate the number of gamma-ray burst\nsources which can contribute to the flux at a given energy\nE [14, 91]:\nNGRB (E) \u2243 \u1e45GRB\n\n2\u03c0 3\nl\n\u03c3t .\n5 max\n\n(29)\n\nThis number of apparent gamma-ray bursts in the cosmic\nray sky characterizes the amount of statistical fluctuation\nto expect around the mean flux at a given energy [14].\nUsing Eq. (22), one obtains:\n\u00134\n\u0010\u03c4 \u0011 \u0012 l\nmax\n\u00d7\nNGRB (E) \u2243 88\n3\n100 Mpc\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22122\n\u0012\nE\nr\u0304i\n\u00d7\n2 Mpc\n1020 eV\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bbi\nBi\n\u00d7\n10\u22128 G\n0.1 Mpc\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u1e45GRB\n\u03c3t\n. (30)\n\u22129\n\u22123\n\u22121\n10 Mpc * yr\n\u03b4t\nThe magnitude of this number of apparent sources implies that the spectrum of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays\nshould not reveal statistical fluctuations until energies as\nlarge as a few 1020 eV, at least for these fiducial values\nthat characterize the scattering centers.\n\n\f15\n5.\n\nDirection dependent effects\n\nSince the sources of protons with energies beyond the\npion production threshold are bound to reside within\n100 \u2212 200 Mpc, one may expect the optical depth of scattering centers to vary with the direction of observation,\njust as the density of matter. In order to discuss the influence of such variation on existing and upcoming data, we\nhave constructed sky maps of the matter concentration\nusing the PSCz catalog of galaxies [92] which presently\noffers the most adequate survey for this task.\nThe integrated column density of baryonic matter up\nto a distance l is shown in Fig. 8 for different maximal\ndistances: l = 40, 80, 120, 160 Mpc (we adopt H0 =\n70 km/s/Mpc). In order to correct for the incompleteness of the catalog, we have followed the prescriptions\nof Ref. [92] and smoothed the galaxy distribution with\na variable gaussian filter, making use of the HEALPix library [93]. The overall resolution of the maps is of order\n7\u25e6 .\nThese maps provide an estimate of the optical depth\nto cosmic ray scattering in the case in which the scattering centers are distributed as the galaxies. If their\ndistribution is biased with respect to that of ng , for instance ni /hni i = bi (ng /hng i), then the optical depth is\nexpressed as the following function of Ng /hNg i:\nR\ndl bi (ng /hng i) Ng\n\u03c4 = hni i\u03c3i l R\n,\n(31)\ndl ng /hng i hNg i\n\nand the prefactor hni i\u03c3i l = h\u03c4 i, see also Eq. (7). The\nquantity Ng /hNg i is that plotted in Fig. 8 for a distance\nl = 160 Mpc. This figure assumes no bias, in which case\n\u03c4 = h\u03c4 i Ng /hNg i. Therefore, in order to read off \u03c4 from\nFig. 8 and the above formula, one should use l = 160 Mpc\nin the definition of h\u03c4 i together with the inferred value of\nNg /hNg i from Fig. 8. If the bias were not trivial, meaning\nbi (ng /hng i) 6= 1, its main effect would be to increase the\ncontrast of Fig. 8. Figures for particular situations can\nbe provided upon demand.\nThe above fiducial values for the scattering centers reveal an important point: depending on the direction of\nobservation, one may be in a regime of small optical\ndepth \u03c4 < 1 or large optical depth \u03c4 > 1. This has\nseveral noteworthy consequences.\nFirst of all, the typical deflection angle becomes itself\ndirection dependent. In particular, the values used in\nEq. (21) correspond to h\u03c4 i = 3 and \u03b4\u03b1 \u221d \u03c4 1/2 . This\nsimple scaling law along with Fig. 8 allow to estimate, as\na function of the parameters characterizing the scattering\ncenters, the typical deflection angle in different parts of\nthe sky.\nA sky map of deflection angles had been provided previously in Ref. [39], using a constrained numerical simulation of the local Universe with an all-pervading (albeit inhomogeneous) magnetic field whose initial data was fixed\nat high redshift. One advantage of the present maps\nshown in Fig. 8 is to parametrize the expected deflection\n\nin terms of the properties of the scattering structures; in\nthis sense, the above maps are more general. Ref. [44]\nhas also provided a similar map, using the PSCz galaxy\ncatalog to construct the matter density field, and scaling\nthe magnetic field to the matter density through the law\nB \u221d \u03c12/3 . The exponent 2/3 assumes isotropic compression of the magnetic field during structure formation\nand it seems that numerical simulations indicate a more\nsophisticated law, with an exponent closer to 1 (see discussion in Refs. [46, 52]). Ref. [44] also reconstructs the\ngalaxy density field on small scales by repopulating randomly the galaxy distribution using the density distribution from the PSCz on larger scales, so that their map is\ninfluenced by this reconstruction on scales smaller than\n\u223c 7\u25e6 .\nFollowing the discussion of Section III B 2, the flux of\na source does not get demagnified nor magnified, up to\npossible magnetic lensing effects, as it crosses a region of\nscattering centers, provided the predicted apparent size\nof the source image does not exceed that of the scattering\nstructure. It will however suffer demagnification in the\nopposite limit. Note that this does not contradict the\nfact that an isotropic distribution of sources will yield\nisotropic arrival directions on the detector provided that\nall arrival directions from the detector can be backtracked\nto infinity. Indeed, if a particular region of the sky is associated with a particularly large angular deflection, the\nflux of any point source is diluted by deflection through\nthe crossing of this structure; however, this deflection also\nopens a larger solid angle on the source plane, so that a\nlarger number of sources can contribute, and both effects\ncompensate each other. This fact has been discussed in\nparticular in Ref. [94] with respect to ultrahigh energy\ncosmic ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field.\nAs mentioned in Ref. [94], one loop hole of the above\nargument is the possible existence of so-called bottle orbits, which do not connect the detector to infinity. However one does not expect this effect to appear at the ultrahigh energies under consideration in view of the (nearly)\nrandom and sporadic distribution of the scattering centers throughout the Universe and in view of the random\nnature of the deflection suffered at each interaction. This\nassertion could be verified using dedicated numerical simulations of particle propagation.\nJust as angular deflection, the time delay will depend\non direction, as \u03b4t \u221d \u03c4 . Although the magnitude of the\ntime delay (more precisely, of its variance) controls the\nnumber of bursting sources that can be seen at a given\ntime, it does not influence the flux received as long as\nNGRB \u226b 1. Indeed, a larger \u03b4t means a larger NGRB (at\na fixed value of \u03c3t /\u03b4t), but the flux of each gamma-ray\nbursts is decreased accordingly by the larger \u03c3t and both\neffects compensate each other exactly. However, if at a\ngiven energy NGRB . 1 in a certain region of the sky,\none should observe a corresponding cut-off in the energy\nspectrum from this region of the sky, hence a reduced\nnumber of events.\nAs a clear example of the above possibility, consider a\n\n\f16\n\n45\n\n180\n\n0\n\n180\n\n45\n\n-180\n\n180\n\n0\n\n-45\n\n-45\n\n45\n\n45\n\n0\n\n-180\n\n180\n\n0\n\n-45\n\n-180\n\n-180\n\n-45\n\nFIG. 8: Integrated galaxy column density as derived from the PSCz catalog of galaxies up to the maximal distances l = 40 Mpc,\nl = 80 Mpc, l = 120 Mpc and l = 160 Mpc from left to right and top to bottom (Mollweide projection). The contours give the\ncolumn density Ng in units of the mean column density hNg i = hng i \u00d7 160 Mpc, with hng i the mean galaxy density.

Then any\nsource has a probability \u2243 \u03c4 of having one scattering\ncenter on the line of sight, and therefore being seen if the\ntime delay is sufficient. If there is no scattering center\non the line of sight (with probability 1 \u2212 \u03c4 ), then the\ntime delay is zero (in a first approximation), so that the\nprobability of observing a source within \u2206\u03a9 and up to a\ndistance l within the lifetime of an experiment \u2206texp \u223c\n10 years is extremely small:\n1\n\u2206\u03a9l3 \u1e45GRB \u2206\n3\n\u2206\u03a9\n\u2206texp\n\u1e45GRB\n\u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22124\n.

In practice, no source should be seen in this\nparticular direction unless it resides in a highly magnetized environment [see discussion after Section II D, see\nalso Eq. (A6)]. As argued in Section III B 2, one might\nsee \"echoes\" of this source from scattering centers located\naway from the line of sight, provided l\u03b4\u03b1i & (ni l)\u22121/2 .\nEven then, however, the total flux of these secondary\nimages would be demagnified by \u03c4 as compared to that\nexpected from the source without scattering.\n\nIn summary, the average flux expected in this solid\nangle \u2206\u03a9 is lower by a factor \u03c4 than that expected from\nregions in which the optical depth is greater than unity.\nConversely, if the source is not of the bursting type,\none might see it directly in the arrival direction if this\nsource lies in a hole of the foreground scattering center\ndistribution.\n\nC.\n\nOpaque regime\n\nThe opaque regime corresponds to \u03c4 > \u03c4eff > 1. In this\ncase, cosmic rays diffuse from the source to the detector\nas in a random billiard.\nThe energy spectrum received from a given source is\nlikely to be strongly modified by the presence of strongly\nmagnetized scattering centers, as discussed in Ref. [35].\nRoughly, one should observe a low-energy cut-off at an\nenergy Ec such that \u03b4\u03b8i2 < 1 for E > Ec and \u03b4\u03b8i2 \u223c 1 at\nlower energies. However, when one considers the energy\nspectrum received from an ensemble of sources, whose\nflux interacts with an ensemble of scattering centers, one\nshould calculate the diffuse average flux in order to make\ncontact with the measured spectrum. This average spectrum should not differ from the spectrum corresponding\n\n\f17\nto rectilinear propagation if the diffusion theorem applies [95] and magnetic horizon effects are unimportant,\n\u22121/3\ni.e. if the distance between two sources ns\nis smaller\nthan the energy loss distance and the diffusion length.\nOtherwise, one should calculate the spectrum following\nthe methods of Ref. [96] with the diffusion coefficient\ngiven below.\n1.\n\nTransport\n\nAssuming that the diffusion process obeys the normal\nlaw hr2 i = 2Dt, one may calculate the diffusion coefficient D using random walk arguments. In particular,\nif one neglects the time spent in a magnetized structure in the course of an interaction, the diffusion coefficient is related to the scattering length via the usual\nlaw: D = lscatt c, where the scattering length lscatt has\nbeen defined in Eq. (8) above.\nIf the particle diffuses inside a structure during an interaction, then it actually gets trapped in this structure\nduring a certain amount of time and exits backwards in a\nmirror-like fashion (see Appendix A). Consider for simplicity a single scattering agent. One may then account\nfor the effect of time trapping by counting the effective\ntime taken to accomplish N steps of the random walk,\nwhich becomes N di (1 + \u03b4ti c/di )/c. The correction decreases D by a factor (1 + \u03b4ti c/di ). Since the trapping\ntime \u03b4ti \u2243 ri /c is smaller than the typical distance di between two scattering centers, this correction is not dominant. Concerning the effect of mirroring, it suffices to\nnote that it takes two interactions to achieve isotropic deflection, hence this decreases the diffusion coefficient by\nanother factor of 2. These two corrections thus remain\nof order unity.\nThe general scaling of this diffusion coefficient with\nenergy is easily grasped. At low energies (typically E .\n1018 eV depending on the parameters characterizing the\nscattering agents), it does not depend on energy, as lscatt\nsimply corresponds to the mean free path for scattering\nd. In the high energy regime, D \u221d E 2 since the number\nof scatterings to achieve a deflection of order unity scales\nin the same way. The above diffusion coefficient may be\nused to describe the propagation of particles, as done in\nRefs. [46, 95, 96, 97, 98]. One may add that the influence\nof any putative all-pervading magnetic field BIGM may\nbe safely neglected, even at energies of order 1018 eV,\nas long as BIGM . 10\u221211 G, since the Larmor radius\n\u0001\n\u0001\u22121\nrL \u2243 100 Mpc E/1018 eV BIGM /10\u221211 G\n.\nIn principle, a realistic distribution of magnetic field\ncells inside the large scale structure might induce a scattering law with a more complex profile than the standard\nexponential form adopted here, which would furthermore\ndepend on time in a non-trivial way so as to account for\nthe effect of trapping. The particle would then follow\na so-called continuous time random walk with waiting\ntimes, the properties of which can be derived by following\nthe methods developed in Refs. [99, 100]. It would cer-\n\ntainly be particularly interesting if anomalous diffusion\nlaws were to occur in such magnetic field configurations.\n\n2.\n\nExperimental signatures for continuously emitting\nsources\n\nThe arrival direction of high energy events will point\nback to the source only if this latter is located at a distance closer than lscatt . In the diffusive\n\u221a regime, the source\ndistance scale is no longer lmax but lscatt lmax , since this\nlatter gives the distance that a particle can cross before\nlosing its energy. Since we assume lmax > lscatt , most of\nthe sources are located beyond lscatt .\nIn the steady state regime, the diffusive flux received\nfrom a source at distance l scales as 1/(lscatt l), hence\nthe flux received from sources within l, with l > lscatt ,\nscales as l2 /lscatt . Consequently, the fraction of the flux\nthat can be received from sources at distances closer than\nlscatt [given by Eq. (11)] is roughly lscatt /lmax , just as in\nthe non-diffusive regime. This fraction gives the fraction\nof events behind which one can hope to detect the source.\nNote that the same delusive effect of finding a scattering center in the arrival direction of cosmic rays occurs\nin this regime just as in the translucent regime.\nOn general grounds, one expects the number of multiplets to be significantly smaller in this case than for small\ndeflection, since the angular size of the image is considerably broadened. However, sources within the sphere of\nlarge angular scattering (for which the Universe appears\ntranslucent) may produce images with higher multiplicity\n\u22121/3\nif they exist, i.e. if ns\n< lscatt . The number of events\nexpected from a source at distance l can be written as:\nNm \u2243\n\nNobs fcov\n.\nns 4\u03c0l2 lmax\n\n(33)\n\nIn order to derive this estimate, it suffices to express the\nflux received from this source, and to replace \u1e44UHECR in\nthis expression using Eq. (11). The parameter fcov corresponds to the sensitivity of the detector in the direction\nof the source, normalized to the average sensitivity (i.e.,\non average fcov = 1). One must emphasize that the\nabove equation assumes that all sources have the same\nluminosity, which may be too restrictive.\nSince Nm \u221d 1/l2, the maximum multiplicity N1 will\n\u22121/3\nbe associated to the closest source at distance \u223c ns\n:\n\u22121/3\n\nN1 \u2243 0.1fcov Nobs\n\nns\n.\nlmax\n\n(34)\n\nTo provide quantitative estimates, if ns = ns,\u22125 \u00d7\n10\u22125 Mpc\u22123 , the number of events expected from the\nclosest source at energies greater than 4 \u00d7 1019 eV is a\n\u22121/3\nfraction 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 ns,\u22125 of all observed events.

NGRB is larger than unity, which\nimplies that one should not detect significant statistical\nfluctuation in the energy spectrum and which explains\nwhy one can record cosmic ray events in a near continuous manner, despite the fact that close-by gamma-ray\nbursts are such rare events.\nThere will of course be an energy Ec where lscatt =\nlmax , beyond which the diffusive regime will no longer\napply. In this case, one must use the formulae given\nin Section III B for the translucent regime. Similarly, regarding sources located within the sphere of large angular\nscattering, i.e. at a distance l < lscatt , the phenomenological consequences are those described in Section III A\nif l < d, or in Section III B if d < l < lscatt .\nIV.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSummary of present results\n\nThe present work has provided an analytical description of ultrahigh cosmic ray transport in highly structured extragalactic magnetic fields. The corresponding\nconfiguration of the extragalactic magnetic field is that of\na collection of scattering centers, such as halos of radiogalaxies or starburst galaxies, or magnetized filaments,\nwith a negligible magnetic field in between. Such a configuration is generally expected in scenarios in which the\nmagnetic field is produced and ejected by a sub-class of\ngalaxies, or generated at the accretion shock waves of\nlarge scale structure. Even if the magnetic field is rather\ngenerated at high redshift, subsequent amplification in\n\nthe shear and compressive flows of large scale structure\nformation tends to produce a highly structured configuration, with strong fields in the filaments of galaxies and\nweak fields in the voids [40, 41, 45, 51].\nIn our description, transport of cosmic rays is modeled\nas a sequence of interactions with the scattering centers,\nduring which the particle acquires a non-zero deflection\nangle and time delay (with respect to straight line crossing of the magnetized region), see Appendix A. In Section II, we have sketched a list of possible scattering centers and their characteristics (mean free path to scattering, magnetic field, coherence length and extent). We\nhave then computed the optical depth \u03c4 of the Universe\nto cosmic ray scattering as a function of energy and distance to the source, as well as the effective optical depth\n\u03c4eff (which is defined in such a way as to become unity\nwhen the total angular deflection becomes unity). As discussed in Section II, the Universe can be translucent to\ncosmic ray scattering if \u03c4 > 1 > \u03c4eff , meaning that the total deflection is smaller than unity but non-zero, opaque\nif \u03c4 > \u03c4eff > 1, or even transparent if 1 > \u03c4 > \u03c4eff . For\ntypical values of the scattering centers parameters, it is\nexpected that the Universe be translucent or opaque on\nthe source distance scale and at energies close to the pion\nproduction threshold. Since this energy is that generally used by experiments as a threshold for the search for\ncounterparts, the above may have important phenomenological consequences.\nIn particular, in the translucent or opaque regime, the\nclosest object lying in the cosmic ray arrival direction\nshould be a scattering center. Since these scattering centers are sites of intense magnetic activity (radio-galaxies,\nstarburst galaxies, shock waves, ...), they might be mistaken with the source. This peculiar feature does not\narise in models in which magnetic deflection is a continuous process in an all-pervading magnetic field. One\ncould thus conceive an \"ironic\" scenario, in which cosmic\nrays are accelerated in gamma-ray bursts, but scatter\nagainst radio-galaxies magnetized lobes, so that one interpret these latter as the source of cosmic rays because\nthey are the only active objects seen on the line of sight.\nIf such counterfeiting is taking place, one should observe\nthat the apparent distance scale to the source (actually\nthe distance to the last scattering surface) is smaller than\nthe expected distance scale to the source (as determined\nby the energy losses). This offers a simple way to test for\nthe above effect.\nIn the translucent regime, the source image is broadened by an angle \u03b4\u03b1 which takes values of order of\na degree at energy 1020 eV for the fiducial values of\nthe scattering structures that we considered: interaction length di \u2243 30 Mpc, extent ri \u2243 1 Mpc, magnetic\nfield B \u2243 10\u22128 G, and coherence length \u03bbi \u2243 0.1 Mpc.\nThe average optical depth at distance 100 Mpc is thus\n\u03c4 \u2243 3 for these values. Due to the uncertainties surrounding these parameters, the deflection could however\nbe larger or smaller by about an order of magnitude.\nIn Section III B 2, we have discussed effects related to\n\n\f19\nthe shape of angular images when the discreteness of the\nscattering centers is taken into account.\nThe inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the local\nUniverse implies that this optical depth to cosmic ray\nscattering should vary with the direction of observation.\nIn Section III B 5, we have provided sky maps of the integrated baryonic matter density up to different distances,\nusing the PSCz catalog of galaxies. These maps allow\nto estimate the fluctuation of the optical depth in different directions, hence that of the deflection angle, since\n\u03b4\u03b1 \u221d \u03c4 1/2 .\nIn our discussion, we have taken into account the inhomogeneous distributions of the scattering centers, see\nSections II C, II D. We have shown numerically that\non path lengths longer than \u223c 200 Mpc, the effect of\ninhomogeneity is negligible, as expected for a Universe\nthat is homogeneous and isotropic on these scales. The\npath length to the first interaction is generally higher by\nabout 40% than in the homogeneous case if the scattering\ncenters distribute according to the dark matter density.\nSince scattering centers tend to concentrate in filaments\nof large scale structure, a particle may also experience\nmultiple interactions upon crossing a filament, as discussed and quantified in Section II C. This explains why\nthe number of interactions in the inhomogeneous case\nconverges toward that of the homogeneous case on long\npath lengths.\n\nB.\n\nRecent data from the Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nIn its first years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has already achieved the largest aperture (in\nkm2 * str * yr) [1], and it has recently released the largest\ncatalog of events above 5.7 * 1019 eV [2]. In this catalog,\n20 out of 27 events originate from within 3 degrees of an\nactive galactic nucleus located within 75 Mpc.\nThe most straightforward interpretation is to infer that\nactive galactic nuclei are the sources of ultrahigh energy\ncosmic rays. However, only one of the observed counterparts is of the FR-I type (Centaurus A), all others are\nmore common Seyfert galaxies. From a theoretical point\nof view, this is unexpected, since these common active\ngalactic nuclei do not seem to offer the required characteristics for the acceleration to ultrahigh energies [101].\nEven Centaurus A, as far as its jets are concerned, does\nnot appear to be a likely source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays [102].\nFurthermore, on a purely experimental level, Gorbunov and co-authors [103] have recently pointed out an\nanomaly in this observed correlation. Assuming that the\nAGN seen in the arrival directions of these high energy\nevents are the source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays,\nthese authors have computed the expected flux using the\nknown distances to these AGN. They have observed that\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory has collected zero event in\nthe direction to the Virgo cluster, whereas at least six\nshould be expected on the basis of the large concentra-\n\ntion of AGN in this direction and the small distance scale\n(assuming that the cosmic rays coming from Centaurus A\nindeed originate from this object).\nRef. [103] thus argues that this observation rules out\nthe possibility that AGN are the sources of ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic rays, unless the cosmic rays seen in the\ndirection to Centaurus A come from further away. However, as pointed out to us during the refereeing process,\nit could also be that the absence of AGN-like source in\nVirgo is a statistical fluctuation due to the small number of sources in the local Universe, or that all AGN-like\nsources do not have the same cosmic ray luminosity. One\nmay also ponder on the possibility that the Galactic magnetic field would exhibit a particular configuration in the\ndirection to Virgo (which lies toward the Galactic North\nPole), which would prevent cosmic rays from penetrating from this direction. Hence at present, one cannot\nexclude formally that AGN are the source of ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic rays, but the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory cannot be argued to sustend this hypothesis\nstrongly either.\nAnother interpretation suggests that sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays cluster with the large scale\nstructure, as AGN do, hence the observed correlation\nwith AGN is a coincidence. This hypothesis deserves\nto be more carefully studied, for instance by performing\ncross-correlations of the observed arrival directions with\ngalaxy catalogs, or by following the method introduced\nin Ref. [104]. However, assuming that the sources are\nlocated close to the AGN which have been seen in the arrival directions should not resolve the flux anomaly noted\nin Ref. [103], also it might mitigate it somewhat.\nA third interpretation is to assume that at least part\nof the observed correlation is accidental because the scattering centers on the last scattering surface cluster with\nthe large scale structure, hence with AGN. This would\nalleviate this flux anomaly, since the sources would no\nlonger have to be associated with the AGN distribution.\nIn particular, the events seen to arise from the Centaurus\ncomplex might have been deflected in its vicinity.\nAs mentioned previously, this scenario can be tested\nby comparing the expected source distance scale with\nthe counterpart distance scale. Interestingly, both do\nnot match, as the source distance scale for particles with\nobserved energy 6 \u00d7 1019 eV is of the order of 200 Mpc,\nsignificantly larger than the maximum distance of 75 Mpc\nfor the observed counterparts. This fact has been noted\nin Ref. [2]; it remained mostly unexplained, although\nit was suggested in this work that both distance scales\nwould agree if the energy scale were raised by 30%.\nMore quantitatively, one can calculate the probability\nthat a given event with a given observed energy originates from a certain distance, using the fraction of the\nflux contributed by sources within a certain distance at\na certain energy. This probability law can be calculated\nusing the techniques developed in Ref. [105], then tabulated. It is then possible to calculate the probability\nof seeing 20 out 27 events from a source located within\n\n\f20\n75 Mpc using the events energies reported in Ref. [2].\nThis probability is small, about 3%; the mean lies at\n15 events out of 27 coming from within 75 Mpc. If one\nrestricts the set of events to those that lie outside the\nGalactic plane (|b| > 12\u25e6 ), with 19 out of 21 seen to correlate, the probability becomes marginal, of order 0.1%\n(the mean lies at 12 out 21 within 75 Mpc). Finally,\nif one restricts oneself to the second set of events collected after May 27 2006, and on those which lie outside\nof the Galactic plane, with 9 out of 11 seen to correlate,\nthe probability becomes of order 10%, with a mean at 7\nout 11 within 75 Mpc. In this latter case, the signal is\nless significant, but the statistics is also smaller. Since\nthe above estimates do not take into account the uncertainty on the energy, and since they assume continuous\ninstead of stochastic energy losses, these numbers should\nbe taken with caution. Nonetheless, the above estimates\nagree with those of Ref. [106], which indicate that 50% of\nprotons with energy E > 6 \u00d7 1019 eV should come from\ndistances less than 100 Mpc and 90% from distances less\nthan 200 Mpc.\nThe above discussion suggests that, unless the energy\nscale is too low or an experimental artefact is present, the\ninferred distance scale to the source appears smaller than\nthe expected source distance scale. In light of the analysis developed in the present paper, this suggests that\npart of the correlation may actually pinpoint scattering\ncenters correlating with AGN rather than the source of\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays. Said otherwise, the Pierre\nAuger Observatory may be seeing, at least partly, the\nlast scattering surface of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays,\nrather than the source population.\nIn order to estimate the fraction of events that are\nlikely to be contaminated by such pollution, one may\nproceed as follows. Assume first that the total deflection\nimparted to the particles with energy > 6 \u00d7 1019 eV is\nless than the 3\u25e6 radius used by the Pierre Auger Observatory for their search. One may then calculate the the\nfraction of galaxies in the PSCz catalog up to a distance\nl = 200 Mpc, weighted appropriately, which lie within 3\u25e6\nof an AGN which is itself located closer than 75 Mpc.\nThe distance l = 200 Mpc is motivated by the fact that\n90% of events with energy > 6 \u00d7 1019 eV originate from a\ndistance smaller than 200 Mpc [106]. One should weigh\neach galaxy with the selection function of the PSCz catalog at the distance l of this galaxy in order to correct\nfor the incompleteness of the catalog; one should also\nweigh each galaxy with a factor 1/l2 to account for flux\ndilution during propagation. In the above estimate, the\nPSCz catalog is used as a tracer of the cosmic ray source\npopulation, and one simply calculates the probability of\nangular coincidence with the AGN sample. The number obtained is 0.31, which suggests that 31% of events\nabove 6 \u00d7 1019 eV could correlate with the AGN, assuming that the PSCz galaxies provide an unbiased tracer\nof the cosmic ray source population and that the magnetic deflection is much smaller than the search radius of\n3\u25e6 . Note that this estimate does not take into account\n\nthe effect of the magnetic field; if one were to restrict\nthe angular radius to 2\u25e6 in order to account for further\npossible Galactic deflection, the above fraction would become 25%. For reference, the probability that a random\ndirection on the sky falls within 3\u25e6 of an AGN (located\ncloser than 75 Mpc) is 0.22 (becoming 0.11 for a radius\nof 2\u25e6 ), which therefore gives the covering factor on the\nsky of these AGN.\nIn order to account for magnetic deflection, one may\nrepeat the above procedure and calculate the probability of coincidence to within 3\u25e6 of an AGN assuming that\nthe event is displaced randomly by an angle \u03b4\u03b1 from the\nlocation of the galaxy drawn from the PSCz catalog. Of\ncourse, one recovers the above result 0.31 for \u03b4\u03b1 \u2192 0, and\nthe probability 0.22 corresponding to isotropic source distribution for \u03b4\u03b1 \u223c 1 (in practice, \u03b4\u03b1 & 45\u25e6 gives a probability 0.22). Interestingly, the fraction of contaminated\nevents increases as \u03b4\u03b1 becomes of order of a few degrees:\nit equals 39% for \u03b4\u03b1 = 1\u25e6 , 48% for \u03b4\u03b1 = 3\u25e6 , then decreases, being 45% for \u03b4\u03b1 = 5\u25e6 and 43% for \u03b4\u03b1 = 7\u25e6 , etc.\nIf the radius of the correlation with the AGN is restricted\nto 2\u25e6 to allow for further deflection in the Galactic magnetic field, these numbers become 21% for \u03b4\u03b1 = 1\u25e6 , 29%\nfor \u03b4\u03b1 = 3\u25e6 and 25% for \u03b4\u03b1 = 5\u25e6 .\nThe above estimates indicate that, within the assumptions of the above discussion, the delusion should not\naffect all events of the Pierre Auger Observatory, but\na significant fraction nonetheless, possibly as high as\n\u2243 50 %. Moreover, it also indicates that intergalactic\nmagnetic deflection could be larger than 3\u25e6 and yet produce a relatively significant false correlation with AGN.\nIf further data from cosmic ray experiments strengthen\nthe observed correlation, then the present interpretation\nwould fail, unless some other effects artifically enhance\nthis false correlation.\nFor instance, one should point out that the above fraction of contaminated events is likely to be enhanced if\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays originate from gamma-ray\nbursts. Indeed, as discussed in Section III B 5, one expects in this case the number of events in regions of low\nforeground density to be smaller by a factor of order \u03c4\n(\u03c4 being the optical depth measured in such directions)\nwhen compared to that coming from regions of optical\ndepth greater than unity. The main reason is that a given\nsource has a probability \u223c \u03c4 of being located behind a\nscattering center which would provide sufficient time delay for the source to become observable wih reasonable\nprobability. On the contrary, a nearby gamma-ray burst\nwith no scattering center on the line of sight has a negligible probability of being seen during a time span of a few\nyears as a result of the small ocurrence rate. Although\nit is difficult to give a simple estimate of the magnitude\nof this effect on the amount of false correlations, one can\neasily see that it would tend to increase this fraction by\nproviding more weight to regions of high foreground density (in which AGN are more numerous).\nIn Ref. [2], the Pierre Auger Observatory has discussed\nthe evolution of the probability of null hypothesis for an\n\n\f21\nisotropic distribution of sources with a varying search radius, maximum AGN redshift and minimum energy (see\nFig. 3 of Ref. [2]). The minimum probability (which indicates a maximal correlation with the AGN) corresponds\nto a search radius 3.2\u25e6 . This minimum can be interpreted\nas an estimate of the amount of Galactic and intergalactic magnetic deflection if one assumes that the source exactly correlates with the AGN. Interestingly, our above\ndiscussion suggests that this number may be a biased\nestimate and that the intergalactic deflection could be\nslightly larger. The increase of the probability of null hypothesis at larger search radii in the Pierre Auger data\ncorresponds to the fact that the covering factor of the\nsearch area increase rapidly with search radius, being\nalready 0.50 at 6\u25e6 . Concerning the redshift evolution,\none would expect in the present model that the correlation would persist to distances as large as 200 Mpc if\nthe search radius is larger than the typical intergalactic\ndeflection. Unfortunately, Ref. [2] does not plot this correlation beyond 100 Mpc. It would be interesting to also\ncarry out this test for different search radii.\nOne should emphasize that in the present interpretation, the correlation with AGN should not persist as\nthe threshold energy is decreased. Indeed, the maximum propagation distance of particles of observed energy\n4 \u00d7 1019 eV is of order 500 Mpc, on which scale the Universe appears isotropic. Therefore, at these energies the\nincoming flux is increasingly isotropic, and the presence\nof scattering centers on the line of sight cannot induce\nanisotropies on an isotropic sky distribution (see discussion in Section III B 2 as well as the discussion on the application of the Liouville theorem in Ref. [94]). The fraction of flux contributed by the isotropic background has\nbeen estimated in Ref. [107] in the absence of extragalactic magnetic field; it reaches 83% for E > 3 \u00d7 1019 eV,\nand 3.6% for E > 5 \u00d7 1019 eV. The strong rise toward\nisotropy as the threshold energy decreases is thus clear.\nThis effect is present, at least qualitatively, in the data of\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory (see Figure 3 of Ref. [2]).\nFinally, it appears that comparing the apparent source\ndistance scale with the expected one, as we have done\nabove, remains the most direct and simple test of the\npresent interpretation. Since there is a non-negligible\ndegeneracy between the expected distance scale and the\nenergy calibration, it seems mandatory to obtain a calibration through other methods that is as accurate as\npossible.\nIt also appears imperative to probe the arrival directions on an event by event basis, focussing on the most\nenergetic events. In the catalog reported in Ref. [2],\nthere is only one event above 1020 eV, whose arrival direction has a relatively small super-Galactic latitude,\nbSG \u2243 \u22126.5\u25e6 . In the above scenario, one should expect to find a scattering center or the source on the\nline of sight, hence it should prove useful to perform a\ndeep search in this direction in the radio domain, looking for traces of synchrotron emission that would attest of\nthe presence of a locally enhanced intergalactic magnetic\n\nfield. Many more events at higher energies, as expected\nfrom future detectors such as Auger North [110], would\ncertainly help in this regard.\nA last word should be added concerning the amount\nof magnetic deflection and the source models. In particular, it would be interesting to examine whether (and to\nwhat cost) the current data could be reconciled with ultrahigh energy cosmic rays being accelerated in the most\npowerful AGN, which offer stronger ground than Seyfert\ngalaxies for acceleration. Such a study can only be conducted through detailed Monte-Carlo simulations which\nallow for substantial scattering angles in inhomogeneous\nmagnetic fields.\nAs explained in Ref. [91], gamma-ray bursts are probably the most elusive of possible ultrahigh energy cosmic\nray sources, as the strongest predictions are that no counterpart should be detected, that the flux should show significant variations around the mean at sufficiently high\nenergies (a few 1020 eV), and that multiplets of events\nshould be clustered in energy. Current data do not violate any of these predictions, but it is clear that experiments with much larger aperture at the highest energies\nwill be needed to test such effects.\nIt is certain that much physics and astrophysics of cosmic ray sources and large scale magnetic fields remain to\nbe unveiled by ongoing and future detectors.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank S.

We consider both the cylindrical geometry, which\nis representative of an interaction with a filament, and\nthe spherical geometry, which we use to model the interaction with a magnetized wind or cocoon. The solution\nof the diffusion equation in a planar geometry can be\nfound in Ref. [90].\nThis discussion assumes that the magnetic field\nstrength and the diffusion coefficient are uniform in the\nscattering center. Expectations in the more general nonuniform case are discussed briefly at the end of this Appendix.\n\n1.\n\nInteraction with a sphere or a filament:\n\n\f22\ngeneral results\n\nIf the scattering length lsc of the particle in the scattering center is much larger than the characteristic path\nlength r\u0304i through the structure, the particle is simply deflected by an angle \u03b4\u03b8i and emerges after a crossing time\nt \u2243 r\u0304i /c. The characteristic size r\u0304i should be thought of\nas the smallest length scale of the structure, i.e. (\u03c0/2)rs\nfor a sphere or (\u03c0/2)2 rf for a filament. The factors of \u03c0/2\naccount for random orientation of the incoming direction.\nThe deflection angle at each interaction can be computed as follows. Consider a spherical magnetized halo\nof radius ri , magnetic field Bi and magnetic coherence\nlength \u03bbi . The magnetic scattering length lsc of a particle of Larmor radius rL in this structure determines the\nlength beyond which the particle has experienced a deflection of order unity. Hence, if lsc \u226a ri , the particle\nundergoes diffusion in the structure so that \u03b4\u03b8i \u223c O(1).\nIn the following Section, it is also shown that the distance\ntraveled in the structure is very small as compared to ri ,\nso that escape actually takes place close to the point of\nentry with a mirror-like deflection of order \u03c0 (to within\n\u00b1\u03c0/2).\nIf, however, lsc \u226b ri , the particle is only weakly deflected. In order to calculate \u03b4\u03b8i2 , one must specify lsc as\na function of rL and \u03bbi . The general relationship between\nthese quantities can be expressed as:\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b2\nrL\n.\n(A1)\nlsc \u2243 \u03b1 rL\n\u03bbi\nThis equation neglects a numerical prefactor of order\nunity (see Ref. [102] for more details). The coefficient \u03b1\nis directly related to the level of turbulence in the structure:\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u22121\n\u03b4Bi\n\u03b1 =\n,\n(A2)\nBi2\nwhere \u03b4Bi represents the turbulent component and Bi\nthe total magnetic field. In the following, we assume\n\u03b1 \u2243 1, meaning full turbulence, but the calculations\nthat follow may be generalized to \u03b1 6= 1 without difficulty. The various scenarios of magnetic pollution discussed before do not favor the existence of significant\ncoherent components of the magnetic field.\nRegarding the exponent \u03b2, \u03b2 = 1 if rL \u226b \u03bbi [102,\n108, 109]. If, however, rL \u226a \u03bbi , then \u03b2 also depends\non the shape of the turbulence spectrum. For instance,\n\u03b2 = \u22122/3 for Kolmogorov turbulence, \u03b2 = 0 for scale\ninvariant turbulence (Bohm regime). For simplicity, and\nin the absence of any knowledge of the turbulence spectrum in the scattering centers, we assume \u03b2 = 0, which\nallows to simplify the discussion. Again, it is possible to\nextend the discussion to different values of \u03b2, albeit at\nthe price of slightly more complicated expressions.\nTherefore, one finds the following deflection angle. If\nrL \u226a \u03bbi , then lsc \u2243 rL \u226a \u03bbi < ri , hence the particle\ndiffuses in the structure and exits with a deflection of\n\norder unity. Note that the inequality \u03bbi < ri simply\nstates that the coherence length of the magnetic field\ncannot exceed the size of the magnetic structure.\nIf rL \u226b \u03bbi , then lsc \u2243 rL2 /\u03bbi . One then\n\u221a must consider\nwhether rL is larger or smaller than \u03bbi ri . In the former case, lsc \u226b ri , hence the particle exits with a small\ndeflection angle \u03b4\u03b8i2 \u2243 r\u0304i \u03bbi /(2rL2 ) [16]. This numerical\nprefactor 1/2 is valid for propagation in a turbulent magnetic field; it becomes 2/3 for a randomly oriented regular\nmagnetic field [14].\nIn the latter case, lsc \u226a ri hence the particle exits\nwith a deflection angle of order unity.\nIn conclusion, the deflection angle can be written in\nthe approximate form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2r2\n\u03b4\u03b8i2 \u2243 1 + L\n.\n(A3)\nr\u0304i \u03bbi\nAlthough this form is only approximate, it interpolates\nsmoothly\n\u221a between the two different regimes\n\u221a of interest\nrL \u226a ri \u03bbi (large deflection) and rL \u226b ri \u03bbi (small\ndeflection).

One can assume that the particle penetrates a length scale lsc inside the filament, and then\nenters the diffusive regime. The time-dependent diffusion equation can then be used to compute the probability of escape as a function of time, treating the point of\nfirst interaction (at depth lsc ) as an impulsive source. To\nthis effect, we describe the filament as a cylinder of radius rf and infinite extension along z and consider cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03b8, z). For simplicity, we assume a\n\n\f23\nspatially uniform diffusion coefficient D\u22a5 in the plane\nperpendicular to z, and a spatially uniform diffusion coefficient Dk in the direction along z. We also neglect energy losses, which is justified in so far as we will show\n\nthat the trapping time is short on the typical energy\nloss timescale. The equation for the Green's function\ng(r, \u03b8, z, t; r0 , \u03b80 , z0 , t0 ) reads:\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u2202t g \u2212 D\u22a5 \u2202r (r\u2202r g) \u2212 D\u22a5 2 \u2202\u03b82 g \u2212 Dk \u2202z2 g = \u03b4(z \u2212 z0 )\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 )\u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) .\nr\nr\nr\n\n(A7)\n\nHere, r0 , \u03b80 , z0 and t0 give the coordinates of the first interaction in the filament. One must also take into account\nthe appropriate boundary conditions, namely that beyond radius rf , the volume is unmagnetized. In the theory of\ndiffusion, such boundary conditions can be modeled by ensuring that the solution to the diffusion equation vanishes\nat a radius rf . In order to solve the diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates under this constraint, one expands\nthe angular part of the Green's function g over a basis of proper functions of the operator \u2202\u03b82 and the radial part over\na basis of Bessel functions Jm (\u03b1ms r/rf ), where \u03b1ms denotes the s\u2212th root of Jm . This guarantees that the boundary\ncondition will be satisfied. The solution of Eq. (A7) reads:\n\ng(r, \u03b8, z, t; r0 , \u03b80 , z0 , t0 ) =\n\n1\n\u03c0rf2\n\u00d7\n\nm=+\u221e\nX s=+\u221e\nX\n\neim(\u03b8\u2212\u03b80 ) e\n\n\u2212\u03b12ms\n\nD\u22a5 |t\u2212t0 |\nrf2\n\n2\n\nJm+1 (\u03b1ms )\n\ne\n\u221a\n\n|z\u2212z0 |2\n4Dk |t\u2212t0 |\n\n4\u03c0Dk |t\u2212t0 |\n\nm=\u2212\u221e s=1\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nJm \u03b1ms rr0f Jm \u03b1ms rrf\n\n\u2212\n\n.\n\n(A8)\n\nThe probability of having the particle inside the filament at any time t > t0 is then given by the volume average of g\nover the filament:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nr0\nZ\ns=+\u221e\n0|\n\u03b1\nJ\nX \u2212\u03b120s D\u22a5 |t\u2212t\n0s\n0\nr\n2\nf\nrf2\nPres (t; t0 ) =\ndv g =\ne\n.\n(A9)\n\u03b1\nJ\n(\u03b1\n)\n0s\n1\n0s\ns=1\nThrough the explicit decomposition of unity over the above basis of Bessel functions, one can verify that Pesc (t \u2192\nt0 ) = 1 as it should. The form of Pres (t; t0 ) tends to suggest that escape takes place on a diffusive timescale rf2 /D\u22a5 ;\nthis statement is actually too naive, as shown in the following. The average residence time in the filament \u03b4tf is\ncalculated as:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nr0\nZ +\u221e\n2 s=+\u221e\n\u03b1\nJ\nX\n0s\n0\nrf\nrf\n4\ndt Pres (t; t0 ) =\n\u03b4tf =\n.\n(A10)\n3\n2D\n\u03b1\nJ\n(\u03b1\n\u22a5 s=1\n1\n0s )\nt0\n0s\nThe factors in the sum on the r.h.s. of Eq. (A10) are much smaller than unity because the particle cannot penetrate\nfurther than lsc \u226a rf into the filament before starting to diffuse, hence r0 \u2243 rf (1 \u2212 lsc /rf ). This substitution followed\nby the expansion of the Bessel functions to first order in terms of lsc /rf leads to the trapping time:\n\u03b4tf \u2243\n\ns=+\u221e\nrf lsc X 2\n,\nD\u22a5 s=1 \u03b120s\n\nwhich is effectively smaller than the diffusive time by a factor lsc /rf . Since D\u22a5 =\n\u03b4tf \u2243\n\nrf\nc\n\ns=+\u221e\nX\ns=1\n\n4\nrf\n= .\n\u03b120s\nc\n\n(A11)\n1\n2 lsc c,\n\none finally obtains:\n(A12)\n\nAlternatively, one could calculate the residence time by averaging Eq. (A10) over the probability of first scattering\nP (r0 ) \u2243 exp [\u2212(rf \u2212 r0 )/lsc ] /lsc , but this would lead to similar results.\nWe thus find that the trapping time is of order of the crossing time, an unexpected result. Since the particle\ndiffuses, the linear length scale traveled in this trapping time is only l \u223c (lsc /rf )1/2 rf \u226a rf . Hence the particle\nenters and exits the filament at about the same location, albeit a crossing time later. In terms of angular scattering,\n\n\f24\nthis interaction is thus akin to mirroring, as the particle will exit in a direction separated by less than \u03c0/2 from the\ndirection of entry in the filament.\nThis law \u03b4tf \u2243 rf /c has been verified numerically, using Monte Carlo simulations of the interaction of a particle\nwith a magnetized filament, for various coherence lengths of the magnetic field. The numerical code used has been\ndescribed in detail in Ref. [46]. The results are shown in Fig. 9 below, where it is seen that the average residence time\ndoes not depend on the coherence length of the magnetic field (which characterizes the diffusion coefficient, hence the\nscattering length), but evolves linearly with the filament radius. Numerically, one obtains \u03b4tf \u2243 1.3rf /c.\n3.\n\nDiffusive interaction with a sphere\n\nThe interaction with a sphere of radius rs is quite similar to that with a filament, although the algebra is slightly\nmore cumbersome. As before, we assume that the particle penetrates a length scale lsc before starting to diffuse in\nthe magnetized sphere, and adopt appropriate boundary conditions at radius rs . The diffusion equation in spherical\ncoordinates reads:\n\u2202t g \u2212\n\n\u0001\nD\nD\nD\n1\n\u2202r r2 \u2202r g \u2212 2\n\u2202\u03b8 (sin \u03b8\u2202\u03b8 g) \u2212 2 2 \u2202\u03c62 g = 2\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 )\u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )\u03b4(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) .

If the length scale of variation of the magnetic field, lB = |\u2207B 2 /B 2 |\u22121 is \"small enough\", the discussion becomes more intricate as the scattering length\nof the cosmic ray becomes itself space dependent, and\nmeaningless if it is larger than lB . Nevertheless, one may\nexpect the following to occur.\nIf the scattering length as measured everywhere in the\nscattering center is larger than its size r, then the total\ndeflection will remain much smaller than unity. Its value\nwill be given by an average of order hrlB /rL2 i, where the\naverage is to be taken on rL (through its spatial dependence via B) on the trajectory. This estimate assumes\n\nthat the particle is deflected by \u03b4\u03b82 \u223c (lB /rL )2 every lB .\nIts corresponds to the estimate of the above discussion if\n\u03bb is replaced by lB and if B is understood as the average\nmagnetic field. The crossing time will remain unchanged,\nof order r/c.\nIf the scattering length is everywhere smaller than r,\nthen the above results should not be modified, i.e. the\nparticle will bounce on the scattering center with a trapping time of order r/c.\nConsider now the intermediate case, for instance that\nwhere the scattering center has a core with a magnetic\nfield such that lsc becomes smaller than the size of the\ncore rc , surrounded by an envelope with B such that\nlsc & r. With probability \u223c (rc /r)2 , the particle may\ncross the envelope and bounce on the core; in this case the\ndeflection angle is of order unity and the total crossing\n\n\f25\ntime of order r/c. With probability \u223c 1 \u2212 (rc /r)2 , the\nparticle may also cross the envelope without interacting\nwith the core and suffer a deflection smaller than unity\nas calculated above; the crossing time remains the same.\nThe typical deflection angle over many interactions of for\nmany particles is of course given by the average of these\ntwo possibilities.\n\nFIG. 9: Residence time in a magnetized filament embedded\nin a non-magnetized medium for a particle impinging on the\nfilament with a scattering length lsc \u226a rf , as a function of\nthe radius of the filament.
