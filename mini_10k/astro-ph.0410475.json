The\nemergent spectral line profiles in both models are very much weaker in non-LTE\nthan in LTE because the UV overionization mechanism produces a very strong\n1\n\nConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u0131\u0301ficas; Spain\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nunderpopulation of the Fe i levels, in particular in the granular regions of the\n3D model. As a result, the non-LTE effects on the derived iron abundance are\nvery important, amounting to \u223c0.9 dex and to \u223c0.6 dex in the 3D and 1D cases,\nrespectively. On the other hand, we find that non-LTE and 3D effects have to\nbe taken into account for a reliable determination of the iron abundance from\nweak Fe ii lines, because the significant overexcitation of their upper levels in\nthe granular regions tend to produce emission features. As a result such Fe ii\nlines are weaker than in LTE and the abundance correction amounts to \u223c0.4 dex\nfor the 3D case.\nWe derive also the oxygen-to-iron abundance ratio in the metal-poor star\nHD140283 by using the O i triplet at 7772\u20135 \u00c5 and the forbidden [O i] line at\n6300 \u00c5. Our 3D results for the oxygen abundance confirm the values reported in\nsome recent investigations. While the oxygen abundance derived from the O i IR\ntriplet is not very sensitive to the presence of granulation inhomogeneities, such\n3D effects amount to \u223c \u2212 0.2 dex for the [O i] line. The non-LTE abundance\ncorrection for the O i IR triplet turns out to be \u22120.2 dex, approximately.\nInterestingly, when both non-LTE and 3D effects are taken into account there\nstill remains significant discrepancies in the iron abundances derived from Fe i and\nFe ii lines, as well as in the oxygen abundances inferred from the O i and [O i] lines.\nWe conclude that the discrepancies could be due to uncertainties in the stellar\nparameters of this metal poor star. We argue that adopting Teff \u22485600 K (instead\nof Teff \u22485700 K) and [Fe/H]\u2248\u22122.0 (instead of [Fe/H]\u2248\u22122.5) substantially reduces\nthe discrepancies in the abundances of iron and oxygen inferred from several\nspectral lines. Under such circumstances we find [O/Fe]\u22480.5 at [Fe/H]=\u22122.\nObviously, our tentative conclusion that the metalicity of this type of metalpoor stars is significantly larger than previously thought may have far-reaching\nimplications in stellar astrophysics.\nSubject headings: Galaxy: abundances - Galaxy: evolution -nucleosynthesis,\nabundances - stars: late-type stars - Sun: abundances\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nReliable determinations of the oxygen and iron abundances in the atmospheres of metalpoor stars are of paramount importance for 21st Century astrophysics. This is because the\nabundances of oxygen and iron in metal-poor stars represent fundamental astrophysical quantities for determining the ages of the oldest stars, for constraining the models of the chemical\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nevolution of the Galaxy, for estimating the yields of light elements (lithium, beryllium and\nboron) from spallation processes in the interstellar and circumstellar gas, for testing different\nscenarios of nucleosynthesis in supernovae, etc. Such studies largely rely upon the oxygento-iron abundance ratio ([O/Fe] = log(O/Fe)\u22c6 \u2212 log(O/Fe)\u2299 ) versus the stellar metallicity\n[Fe/H].\n\n1.1.\n\nThe oxygen abundance problem in metal-poor stars\n\nThe shape and spread of the [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation is still hotly debated in the\nliterature (e.g., Israelian et al. 2001; Asplund & Garc\u0131\u0301a P\u00e9rez 2001; Mel\u00e9ndez & Barbuy\n2002; Nissen et al. 2002; Fulbright & Johnson 2003; Takeda 2003, and references therein).\nThe controversy is linked with discordant results obtained using different indicators of\nthe oxygen abundance, such as: i) the oxygen [O i] forbidden \u03bb6300 \u00c5 line; ii) the oxygen O i\ninfrared triplet at 7772\u20135 \u00c5; iii) the OH lines in the near ultraviolet; iv) the OH lines in the\ninfrared. More precisely, the oxygen abundance derived using all these lines agree more or less\nwith each other for moderate metal-deficient disk stars having \u22121 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 0. However,\nthere are clear discrepancies among the results obtained for metal-poor halo stars with lower\nmetallicities. Some authors find that the [O/Fe] ratio shows a plateau between 0.4 and 0.5\ndex in the metallicity range -3<[Fe/H]< \u2212 1 (Barbuy 1988; Kraft et al. 1992; Fulbright &\nKraft 1999; Asplund & Garc\u0131\u0301a P\u00e9rez 2001; Caretta et al. 2000; Mel\u00e9ndez & Barbuy 2002),\nwhile others find a linear increase with decreasing metallicity, reaching [O/Fe]\u2243 +1 dex\nat [Fe/H]= \u22123 (Abia & Rebolo 1989; Tomkin et al. 1992; Cavallo et al. 1997; Israelian\net al. 1998, 2001; Boesgaard et al. 1999; Mishenina et al. 2000; and references therein).\nRecently, Nissen et al. (2002) have analyzed [O i] and [Fe ii] lines within the framework of\n3D atmospheric models and LTE line formation concluding that there is a quasi-linear trend\nfor [Fe/H]< \u22122, with [O/Fe]\u2243 +0.5 dex at [Fe/H]= \u22122.5. Furthermore, an extensive 1D\nre-analysis of published equivalent widths for the O i IR and the forbidden [O i] lines (see\nTakeda 2003) shows that the discrepancy between O i and [O i] lines in metal-poor halo stars\ntends to be smaller for stars with higher effective temperatures (Teff ) and gravities (logg), i.e.\npreferentially for dwarfs and subgiants than for giants. Fulbright & Johnson (2003) support\nthis conclusion. In addition, the oxygen abundances in dwarfs derived from the O i IR lines\ntend to have values between those obtained with the UV OH and [O i] lines.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n1.2.\n\nThe iron abundance problem in metal-poor stars\n\nA key problem directly related with the [O/Fe] issue in metal-poor stars is the reliability\nof the iron abundance determinations. In fact, the derivation of the iron abundance from Fe i\nand/or Fe ii lines is a very complex problem that requires detailed non-LTE investigations\n(hereafter NLTE) like the one carried by Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) and in this\npaper. In general, the Fe i lines suffer from UV overionization in the atmospheres of latetype stars (Athay and Lites 1972; Rutten 1988; Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001). This\nNLTE effect tends to be substantially more important in metal-poor stars than in solar-like\nstars as a result of the lower electron density and of the weaker UV blanketing (Th\u00e9venin\n& Idiart 1999; Shchukina and Trujillo Bueno 2001; Israelian et al. 2001, 2004; Shchukina et\nal. 2003). We should mention also that Gratton et al.(1999) concluded that NLTE effects\nare rather small in metal-poor stars. However, their calculations presumably overestimated\nthe efficiency of inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms which thermalize the Fe i levels and\nthus almost restore LTE conditions.\nIt is of interest to point out that while the Fe i lines are (in principle) expected to\nbe sensitive to the UV overionization mechanism, the LTE approximation is thought to be\nsuitable for weak lines of Fe ii (see, e.g., Asplund et al 1999; Nissen et al. 2002). However,\nas we shall see below this does not have to be necessarily the case because many subordinate\nFe ii lines whose upper levels are of odd parity (starting at z 6 Do ) might be partially filled by\nemission due to an optical pumping mechanism similar to that investigated by Cram et al.\n(1980) for the solar case.\n\n1.3.\n\nThe solar oxygen abundance problem\n\nObviously, the solar case constitutes a fundamental reference for a reliable quantification\nof chemical abundances in other stars. The solar iron abundance appears to be fairly well\ndetermined now (log\u01eb\u2299 (Fe)=7.50\u00b10.10; see Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001) - that is, it\nis similar to the meteoritic value. In fact, this is the value adopted by Nissen et al. (2002)\nin their study of the O/Fe ratio in metal-poor stars.\nGreat progress has been also made towards a reliable determination of the solar oxygen\nabundance. The 1D modeling approach leads to discrepancies between the solar oxygen abundance determined from the permitted O i lines and from the [O i] and OH lines. Abundance\ndeterminations from OH lines using the 1D model of Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) suggested\nfirst a high oxygen abundance value (log\u01eb\u2299 (O)=8.93\u00b10.03; see Grevesse et al. 1984; Sauval\net al. 1984; Anders & Grevesse 1989). Several years later, Grevesse & Sauval (1998) obtained\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nan oxygen abundance that was lower by 0.1 dex. This lower value was found after using improved loggf values and a slightly modified 1D model, which helped to remove the existence\nof a dependency of the derived oxygen abundance with the excitation potential of the lower\nlevel of the OH transitions. The forbidden [O i] line gives also a high oxygen abundance\nvalue when the contribution of the blend due to a Ni i line is ignored (Lambert, 1978; Sauval\net al. 1984; Holweger 2001). However, the permitted O i lines at \u03bb7772\u20135 \u00c5 yield a value\nfor the oxygen abundance that is lower by 0.2 dex (Kiselman 1993; Holweger 2001). Some\nauthors have argued that the existing NLTE calculations for these spectroscopic indicators\nof the oxygen abundance might not be valid due to the neglect of inelastic collisions with\nhydrogen. For this reason the solar oxygen abundance derived from the [O i] forbidden line\nwas considered as the most reliable one, because of the suitability of the LTE approximation\n(hence, uncertainties of collisional rates with hydrogen atoms do not play any role). Another\nargument used to support a high value for the oxygen abundance is the small scatter in the\noxygen abundances obtained from different OH lines. Kiselman & Nordlund (1995) tried\nto clarify the solar oxygen abundance issue by using a 3D solar photospheric model that\nis similar but less sophisticated than that of Asplund et al. (2000). They concluded that\na downward revision of the solar oxygen abundance is required, with respect to the value\nderived from [O i] and OH lines. More recently, Allende Prieto et al. (2001) have obtained a\nmore precise estimate by taking into account the influence of the above-mentioned blend by\nthe Ni i line and by using the 3D hydrodynamical model of Asplund's et al. (2000). They\nfound log\u01eb\u2299 (O)=8.69\u00b10.05, which shows that the [O i]-based abundance derived via the 3D\napproach is significantly lower than that derived from classical 1D model atmospheres.\nIn a recent IAU Symposium on modeling of stellar atmospheres Shchukina et al. (2003)\nreported that the oxygen abundance obtained via NLTE synthesis of the solar O i IR triplet\nin the 3D solar photosphere model of Asplund's et al. (2000) is log\u01eb\u2299 (O)\u22488.7. This result is\nin good agreement with both Allende Prieto's et al. (2001) conclusion and with the recent\n3D analysis of Asplund et al. (2004) who found excellent agreement between the averaged\noxygen abundance values derived from [O i], O i, OH vibration-rotation and OH pure rotation\nlines1 .\n1\n\nIt is interesting to mention that the oxygen abundances obtained by Asplund et al. (2004) from OH\nrotational lines using the 3D modeling approach show a large line-to-line scatter, and with sensitivity to the\nline strength and to the excitation potential of the transition's lower level. However, such presumably minor\ndiscrepancies are not the topic of this paper. Here we restrict ourselves to consider the NLTE determination\nof the solar oxygen abundance via O i lines, for consistency with similar computations we have carried out\nfor the metal-poor star HD140283.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n1.4.\n\nPossible reasons for the abundance discrepancies\n\nIt is currently believed that abundance discrepancies in metal-poor halo stars and the\nsun are dominated by deficiencies in the spectral line modeling. Errors in the measurements\nof equivalent widths are of minor importance with the exception of weak [O i] and Fe ii\nlines. All abundance indicators in metal-poor stars are to a different degree sensitive to the\nadopted stellar parameters (Teff , logg and [Fe/H]). They have to depend also on atmospheric\nproperties such as the temperature gradient and the ratio of the line to continuous opacity.\nLarge uncertainties could result from neglecting atmospheric inhomogeneities and velocity\nfields (i.e., granulation inhomogeneities produced by the stellar surface convection process).\nPart of the discrepancies are probably due to NLTE effects. There is now an abundance of\nliterature concerning the iron and oxygen line formation problems in classical plane-parallel\nstellar atmospheric models (Th\u00e9venin & Idiart 1999; Mishenina et al. 2000; Kiselman 2001;\nTakeda 2003; and references therein). The recent generation of 3D hydrodynamical models\nof stellar atmospheres have activated the present debates on the influence of granulation\ninhomogeneities and of NLTE effects on the determination of chemical abundances in metalpoor stars (see Asplund et al. 1999; Asplund and Garc\u0131\u0301a P\u00e9rez et al. 2001; Shchukina &\nTrujillo Bueno 2001; Nissen et al. 2002; Asplund et al. 2004). In this respect, it is very\nimportant to emphasize that the 3D hydrodynamical simulations of Asplund and coworkers\nshow that the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars may have substantially lower kinetic\ntemperatures than the radiative equilibrium temperatures of the 'classical' theoretical 1D\nmodel atmospheres of Kurucz (1993) and the MARCS collaboration (Gustafsson et al. 1975).\n\n1.5.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe previous discussion makes evident that detailed, 3D+NLTE investigations of the\niron and oxygen abundances are urgently needed. However, it is crucial that this type of\nanalyses are carried out jointly for iron and oxygen, and using the same set of atmospheric\nmodels, continuum opacity package and radiative transfer code. The present paper presents\nthe results of such an investigation. We study the NLTE formation problem of the Fe i,\nFe ii and O i lines in a 3D hydrodynamical model of the atmosphere of the metal-poor star\nHD140283. This classical halo subgiant is widely used for studies of the very early Galaxy\nand the origin of the chemical elements. In order to quantify the impact of 3D simulations\non the abundance determinations in HD140283 we carry out a detailed comparison with\nthe 1D classical modeling. To this end, we use the 3D hydrodynamical atmospheric model\nof Asplund's et al. (1999) for the star HD140283, as well as a suitable grid of Kurucz's\n1D models. Moreover, we evaluate the extent to which 3D+NLTE effects influence the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ndetermination of the stellar parameters of this metal-poor subgiant.\nOur paper considers also the case of the Sun as a reference for stellar abundance determinations with emphasis on the solar oxygen abundance derived from the O i IR triplet. As\nin our NLTE+3D analysis of the solar iron abundance (Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001) we\ninvestigate here the solar oxygen abundance problem by using the same 3D hydrodynamical\nsolar granulation model.\n\n2.\n\nThe diagnostic method\n\nIn order to determine the stellar abundances of iron and oxygen we have to compare\nsome of the properties of the observed spectral line profiles (e.g., their equivalent widths)\nwith those calculated via the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation in a given\nmodel of the atmosphere of the star under investigation. To this end, we have used the\nsame NLTE code and strategy that we applied in our previous investigation of the iron line\nformation problem in a 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar photosphere (see Shchukina &\nTrujillo Bueno 2001), with the only difference that we have now computed flux profiles. Our\n3D strategy for investigating the issue of the abundances of iron and oxygen in the metalpoor star HD140283 is similar to that of described by Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001)\nfor solar-like atmospheres, but using a 3D snapshot model from Asplund's et al. (1999)\nstellar surface convection simulation. Therefore, we have neglected the effects of horizontal\nradiative transfer on the atomic level populations -that is, we have used the so-called 1.5D\napproximation. As discussed by Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) this is expected to be\na good approximation for determining the stellar iron abundance from Fe i and Fe ii lines.\nKiselman & Nordlund (1995) already demonstrated that it is also a good approximation for\nthe oxygen IR triplet.\nOur NLTE code is based on very efficient iterative methods (Trujillo Bueno & Fabiani\nBendicho 1995; Socas-Navarro & Trujillo Bueno 1997; Trujillo Bueno 2003) that were developed to facilitate radiative transfer simulations with complex atomic systems in realistic\nstellar atmospheric models. We have carried out both LTE and NLTE spectral line syntheses\nby using both the 1D and 3D models mentioned below. In each case, the abundances of iron\nand oxygen are modified iteratively till achieving the best fit to the observations.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.\n\nThe observations\n\nWe have chosen 33 Fe i and 15 Fe ii lines for our 3D and 1D determinations of the iron\nabundance in the halo subgiant HD140283. The equivalent widths (W ) of all the Fe i lines and\nof 11 Fe ii lines were obtained from high-resolution spectra observed a few years ago with\nthe Harlan J. Smith 2.7m telescope at McDonald observatory (R. Garc\u0131\u0301a L\u00f3pez, private\ncommunication; see also Allende Prieto et al. 1999). The equivalent widths (W ) for the\nremaining 4 Fe ii lines are taken from Table 3 of Nissen et al. (2002). They are weak lines with\nW in the range 1\u22124 m\u00c5 . Their wavelengths are \u03bb\u03bb6149.238, 6247.562, 6432.654, 6456.376\n\u00c5. The iron lines used in our analysis are listed in Table 1.\nThe O i IR triplet lines in the metal-poor star HD140283 are weak. Given uncertainties\nin the measurements we have averaged their equivalent widths over three sets of observations\n(Abia & Rebolo 1989; Tomkin et al. 1992, and G. Israelian, private communication). The\nresulting equivalent widths of the 7772, 7774 and 7775 \u00c5 lines used in our oxygen abundance\ndeterminations are 7.9, 4.8, 3.4 m\u00c5, respectively. The equivalent width of the forbidden [O i]\n\u03bb6300 \u00c5 line (W = 0.5 m\u00c5) has been taken from Nissen's et al. (2002) paper. The oxygen\nline data are specified in Table 1.\nMeasurements of the equivalent widths of the solar O i IR lines tend to have an uncertaintly of \u223c5%. Therefore, we have used averaged values of five sets of observations at\nthe solar disk centre (Jungfraujoch atlas of Delbouille et al. 1973; Gurtovenko & Kostik\n1989; Altrock 1968; M\u00fcller et al. 1968; King & Boesgaard 1995). The resulting averaged\nsolar equivalent widths for the 7771.96, 7774.18 and 7775.40 \u00c5 lines are 81.6, 70.4, 57.2 m\u00c5,\nrespectively.\n\n4.\n\nThe atmospheric models\n\nIn each case (i.e., the solar and the metal-poor star) we have used a single 3D snapshot\nmodel taken from realistic radiation hydrodynamical simulations of stellar surface convection\n(Stein & Nordlund 1998; Asplund et al. 1999, 2000). Such time-dependent simulations\nhave no adjustable free parameters, since they are based on the numerical solution of the\nequations of mass, momentum and energy conservation for given values of the effective\ntemperature (Teff ), surface gravitational acceleration (logg) and chemical composition. In\norder to facilitate the radiative transfer calculations the original snapshots, which have 82\ngridpoints along the vertical direction, were interpolated to grids of 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 102 and\n50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 121 points for the solar and metal-poor star cases, respectively. The improvement\nin the vertical resolution (i.e., with 102 and 121 gridpoints sampling the line and continuum\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nforming regions) was introduced to enhance the accuracy of the NLTE calculations.\nThe solar 3D model is that described by Asplund et al. (2000). This 3D model of\nthe solar photosphere has been used by Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) in their NLTE\ninvestigation of the solar iron abundance. We have also used it to determine the solar oxygen\nabundance via NLTE analysis of the O i IR triplet at 7772\u20135 \u00c5.\nInformation on the corresponding 3D model for the star HD140283 can be found in\nAsplund et al. (1999). The adopted stellar parameters were logg = 3.7, Teff = 5700 K and\n[Fe/H]=-2.5, which result from the infrared flux method (IRFM) for Teff , from Hipparcos\nparallaxes for logg and from published values for the [Fe/H] (see Asplund et al. 1999). In\nour differential comparison between the results obtained via the 1D and 3D approaches we\nhave used atmospheric models characterized by the same stellar parameters (Teff , logg and\n[Fe/H]). In Sect. 8 we will also show results in a grid of 'classical' 1D models spanning the\nrange 5300 \u2264 Teff \u2264 5700, 3.7 \u2264 logg \u2264 3.9, \u22122.0 \u2264 [Fe/H] = \u22122.5.\n\n5.\n\nThe atomic models\n\nIn our spectral synthesis of oxygen and iron lines we adopted the quantum-mechanical\napproach developed by Anstee & O'Mara (1995); Barklem & O'Mara (1997), and Barklem\net al (1998) for the Van der Waals collisional broadening. In the following subsections we\nprovide some information about the atomic models of oxygen and iron we have used for our\nradiative transfer calculations.\n\n5.1.\n\nOxygen\n\nOur atomic model for oxygen is based on the data of Carlsson & Judge (1993). It has 23\nO i fine structure levels and one O ii level. We considered 31 bound-bound and 23 bound-free\nradiative transitions. The O i Grotrian diagram has a helium-like structure. The triplets and\nthe quintets are only weakly coupled to each other. The two systems differ in one important\naspect: the triplets are connected to the ground state by strong resonance lines, while the\nquintets are not. The latter form a separate system with the 35 S level acting as a ground\nlevel and the 7772\u20135 \u00c5 IR triplet as resonance lines. O i levels have hydrogen-like energies.\nAs a result, there is an important wavelength coincidence of the O i 1025 \u00c5 line with the\nhydrogen Lyman \u2212 \u03b2 line. We emphasize that the NLTE results for O i are quite insensitive\nto including additional levels and transitions (Shchukina 1987; Kiselman 1993; Takeda 2003).\nIn agreement with previously published results we have found that the effects of the coupling\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbetween the triplet and quintet systems, Ly\u03b2 pumping, and the binding of CO molecules\nare marginal in the stellar atmospheres studied here (see Shchukina 1987; Kiselman 1993;\nCarlsson & Judge 1993; Kiselman & Nordlund 1995).\n\n5.2.\n\nIron\n\nOur model atom for Fe i+Fe ii+Fe iii is similar to that used by Shchukina & Trujillo\nBueno (2001). It has 225 Fe i levels, 23 Fe ii levels and 1 level for Fe iii including their\nmultiplet fine structure. The Fe i levels are interconnected by 330 bound-bound radiative\ntransitions, while we have 25 strong radiative transitions among the Fe ii levels. All levels are\ncoupled via collisional transitions with electrons. The Fe i term diagram is, in fact, complete\nup to an excitation potential \u03c7 = 5.72 eV. At higher energies it contains about 50% of the\nterms that have been presently identified. Each term of our atomic model is coupled to its\nparent term of the next ionization stage by photoionization transitions. For most of the Fe i\nterms that have \u03c7 \u22645 eV we used the experimental photoionization cross sections given by\nAthay & Lites (1972). For the rest of them, and also for the Fe ii terms, the hydrogen-like\napproximation was used. 2\nIn our calculations we have not included inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms. We\nhave also neglected the UV haze opacities. We have carried out several numerical experiments in order to investigate how large could be the uncertainties in the iron abundance\ndeterminations due to uncertainties in the hydrogen collisional rates, in the UV haze opacity\nand in the bound-free cross sections. Considering all factors together we have found that\nthe uncertaintly for the solar iron abundance does not exceed 0.07 dex (see Shchukina &\nTrujillo Bueno 2001). The problem of the iron abundance uncertainty for the metal-poor\nstar HD140283 is discussed in Section 8.\n\n6.\n\nThe oxygen abundances\n\nIn this section we report on the results we have obtained for the oxygen abundance in\nthe sun and in the metal-poor star HD140283. Our abundance determinations and some\nrecent abundance studies by other authors are briefly summarized in Tables 2 and 3.\n2\n\nIt is interesting to mention that the new radiative cross-sections of Bautista (1997) are substantially\nlarger than those given by the hydrogenic approximation. Therefore, in what respects the influence of\nphotoionization cross sections, we might perhaps be underestimating the NLTE effects.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n6.1.\n\nThe Sun\n\nWe have derived the abundance of oxygen in the solar photosphere by fitting the observed disk centre profiles and equivalent widths of the O i IR triplet via spectral synthesis in the 3D model of the solar photosphere. Taking into account NLTE effects we find\nlog\u01eb(O) = 8.70 \u00b1 0.06 (see also Shchukina et al. 2003), while the LTE approximation gives\nlog\u01eb(O) = 8.93 \u00b1 0.06. Note, that the uncertainties reflect the line-to-line scatter for the OI\nIR triplet lines. In both cases we obtained an almost perfect fit to the observed disk centre\nprofiles and equivalent widths. Our NLTE result is in good agreement with that obtained by\nAllende Prieto et al. (2001) from the forbidden [O i] 6300 \u00c5 line (log\u01eb(O) = 8.69). It is also\nconsistent with the 3D result of Asplund at al. (2004) for the OH lines (log\u01eb(O) = 8.61\u22128.65)\nand with their full 3D+NLTE result for the O i triplet (log\u01eb(O) = 8.65). It is important to\nnote that the small discrepancy between ours and Asplund's et al. (2004) solar abundance\nvalue derived from the O i IR triplet is mainly due to differences in the oscillator strengths\nused (\u2206loggf \u2248 \u22120.05 dex). The oxygen abundance changes that result from a 5% uncertainty in the solar equivalent width measurements of these spectral lines lie in the same\nrange (\u2248 \u00b10.05 dex).\nThe NLTE formation of the O i triplet can be easily understood via a two-level atom\napproach if the line opacity is calculated assuming LTE (Shchukina 1987; Kiselman 1993;\nKiselman & Nordlund 1995; Takeda 2003; Shchukina et al. 2003, Asplund et al. 2004,\nand references therein). The photon losses mechanism lowers the line source functions both\nin the granular and intergranular regions of the 3D model, which implies that the NLTE\nprofiles of the IR triplet lines are deeper than in LTE. The effect is larger in the intergranular regions, but the spatially averaged emergent profiles are only slightly affected by\nthe granulation inhomogeneities. Consequently, the effects of granulation inhomogeneities\non the NLTE solar oxygen abundance determination are small, i.e. \u223c 0.06 dex (Shchukina\net al. 2003). More significant are the NLTE abundance corrections for the O i infrared\ntriplet lines observed at the solar disk centre, which amount to \u22120.25, \u22120.22, \u22120.20 dex\nfor \u03bb\u03bb7771.96, 7774.18, 7775.40 \u00c5, respectively - that is, the LTE approximation tends to\noverestimate the derived oxygen abundance. Such NLTE effects are very similar to those\nreported by Asplund et al. (2004), which result from full 3D+NLTE computations.\n\n6.2.\n\nThe metal poor halo subgiant HD140283\n\nIt is convenient to begin this section by giving the values of the oxygen abundances\nwe have obtained without assuming LTE when using the 1D and 3D models of this metal\npoor star. As mentioned above, both models are characterized by logg = 3.7, Teff = 5700 K\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nand [Fe/H]= \u22122.5. The 1D model gives log\u01eb(O) = 7.11 \u00b1 0.06 for the O i IR triplet, while\nlog\u01eb(O) = 7.18 for the [O i] forbidden line at 6300 \u00c5. Concerning the 3D-based determination\nwe find log\u01eb(O) = 7.08 \u00b1 0.06 when using the O i IR triplet, but log\u01eb(O) = 6.96 for the\n[O i] line. Our 1D results differ slightly from those presented by Nissen et al. (2002),\nprobably because we have not used the same continuum opacity package and/or identical\n1D atmospheric models. Our estimates indicate that the abundance differences could reach\n\u223c 0.05 \u2212 0.07 dex.\nHaving given these values, it is now of interest to note that the NLTE effects in the 1D\nand 3D atmospheric models of this metal poor star are not negligible, but smaller than in\nthe solar case because the O i IR lines originate in deeper layers where their source functions\nand the level populations of their upper levels are closer to their LTE values (Shchukina et\nal. 2003). Adopting LTE for the O i lines leads to an abundance overestimation of 0.18 and\n0.16 dex for the 1D and 3D cases, respectively. The determination of the oxygen abundance\nbased on the O i IR triplet is nearly insensitive to 3D effects. The correction does not exceed\n0.03 dex.\nOn the contrary, the forbidden [O i] line at 6300 \u00c5 is sensitive to the stellar atmospheric\ninhomogeneities. In agreement with Nissen et al. (2002) we find that a 3D analysis reduces\nthe oxygen abundance derived from this forbidden line by 0.22 dex. The NLTE correction\nis extremely small (< \u22120.01 dex).\n\n7.\n\nThe iron abundance\n\nThis section focusses on the iron abundance in the Sun and in HD140283. Our results\nand a comparison with those of recent publications are given in Tables 2 and 3.\n\n7.1.\n\nThe Sun\n\nShchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) applied a 3D+NLTE approach to determine the\nsolar iron abundance from 18 Fe i lines that were carefully selected. Ideally, one would like\nto determine the iron abundance in the Sun and HD140283 employing the same Fe i line list.\nHowever, due to the relatively high solar metallicity the solar spectral lines at wavelengths\nbelow 5000 \u00c5 are much more affected by blends than in the metal-poor star HD140283. As\na result, overlapping wings of nearby strong lines cause large uncertainties in the equivalent\nwidth measurements of most of the solar Fe i lines listed in Table 1. The only exception are\nthe lines at \u03bb > 5700 \u00c5 (i.e. only 8 Fe i lines from 33 ones). In any case, the main reason\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwhy not the same lines can be used in the Sun and HD140283 is that the line strengths are\nvastly different in the two cases. Therefore, the weak iron lines in HD140283 are very strong\nand therefore ill-suited for abundance purposes in the Sun. Thus, to recalculate the iron\nabundance of the Sun using the lines of Table 1 is hardly possible.\nThe solar Fe I lines used in our 3D solar abundance determination (see Table 1 in\nShchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001) were selected from the well-known \"Kiel+Oxford\" line\nlist according to the criteria discussed by Kostik, Shchukina & Rutten 1996. The lines chosen\nby Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) account for the iron abundance behaviour versus the\nlower-level excitation potential \u03c7 -that is, for the existence of both an abundance dependence\non \u03c7 and a sizable scatter in the abundance values for each \u03c7. Such 18 representative Fe i\nlines yield the largest and lowest abundances for each \u03c7-value and spaning a large range in\n\u03c7 which goes from 0 to 4.6 eV. This should be a very suitable choice of lines in order to\nevaluate the largest 3D effects. Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) obtained a Fe abundance\nlog\u01eb\u2299 (Fe)=7.50\u00b10.10 for the 3D+NLTE case. The 3D+LTE approach gives a lower abundance, i.e. log\u01eb\u2299 (Fe)=7.43\u00b10.11. Neglecting the effect of granulation inhomogeneities leads\nto a considerably larger value (log\u01eb\u2299 (Fe)=7.62\u00b10.04; e.g. Kostik et al. 1996).\nWe stress that the Fe i lines we have used for the star HD140283 were chosen to obtain\na combination of lines that is comparable to that provided by the 18 solar lines (concerning\ntheir equivalent widths and \u03c7 coverage).\n\n7.2.\n\nThe metal-poor halo subgiant HD140283\n\nLike in the solar case (Shchukina and Trujillo Bueno 2001), near-UV overionization\nappears to be the main NLTE mechanism for Fe i in this metal-poor star. Both in the\n1D and 3D models it causes an important underpopulation of the Fe i levels and hence a\nreduction in the opacity of the Fe i lines (Fig. 1, left panel). As a result, the atmospheric\nheights where the line optical depth reaches unity are shifted toward deeper layers where\nthe line source functions turn out to be close to the Planck function. The relevance of this\neffect increases with the vertical temperature gradient, which is larger above the granules.\nFor this reason, we find a strong weakening of the Fe i lines that emerge from such granular\nregions, while above the intergranular lanes the emergent spectral line profiles do not change\nappreciably. On the whole, the calculated NLTE profiles turn out to be much weaker than\nwhen the LTE approximation is used (see Fig. 2).\nConcerning NLTE effects in Fe ii lines it is very important to point out that in the\ngranular regions we find a significant overpopulation of the excited levels of odd parity\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nstarting at z 6 Do (Fig. 1, right panel). According to Cram et al. (1980) and Rutten (1988)\nthis effect is caused by an excess in the UV continuum radiation field near 2600 \u00c5, which leads\nto a pumping of the upper level populations of the Fe ii lines. As a consequence, the source\nfunctions of the Fe ii lines with high excitation energy of the upper level (\u03c7up \u2265 4.8 ev) exceed\nsignificantly the Planck function values. This implies that such Fe ii lines are weaker than\nstipulated by the LTE approximation and may even be in emission instead of in absorption.\nThis radiative pumping mechanism takes place in both the 1D and 3D models. Like in the\ncase of Fe i lines it is sensitive to the vertical temperature gradient. The steeper the gradient,\nthe larger the pumping. As a result, in the granular regions where the temperature gradients\nare larger the effect is much more pronounced (see Fig. 1).\nThe importance of such an effect is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows both NLTE and\nLTE results for two Fe ii lines using the 3D model atmosphere of the metal-poor subgiant\nHD140283. We point out that emission is much more pronounced for the emergent profiles that originate above the stellar granular regions, while above the intergranular lanes\nthe spectral line profiles are hardly modified with respect to the LTE case. Allowing for\ndepartures from LTE produces a drastic change in the calculated spatially averaged flux of\nthe weak Fe ii \u03bb6247.56 \u00c5 line in the 3D model: the absorption profile is replaced by one in\nemission. Note, that this spectral line is taken from the set of weak Fe ii lines that Nissen\net al. (2002) assumed to be insensitive to NLTE effects. However, we find that such type\nof lines do suffer from the above-mentioned UV pumping mechanism because all of them\nbelong to the aforementioned category of lines, i.e. their upper levels are of odd parity and\nare situated above the z 6 Do -level. The stronger Fe ii \u03bb5316.62 \u00c5 line displayed in Fig. 3 is\nalso from this category. Figure 3 clearly demonstrates that the stronger the spectral line the\nsmaller the relative effect of the UV-pumping. For this line emission arises only at the core\nof the \"granular\" profiles. Spatial averaging masks completely such an emission, but makes\nthe flux profile weaker than in LTE. It is also of interest to mention that in the 1D stellar\natmosphere model departures from LTE produce similar changes in the Fe i and Fe ii lines\nbut they are less pronounced than in the 3D case. For instance, the flux profile of the weak\nFe ii \u03bb6247.56 \u00c5 line turns out to be in absorption for the 1D+NLTE case.\nHow large could be the impact of UV-overionization and UV-overexcitation on the iron\nabundance determination in the star considered? It is obvious that in order to compensate\nfor a weakening of the emergent spectral line profiles in the stellar atmosphere model under consideration the iron abundance must be increased in comparison with the LTE case.\nFigure 4 quantifies this conclusion. It shows the LTE versus NLTE iron abundances derived\nfrom either Fe i or Fe ii lines in the 3D and 1D stellar atmospheric models of the metal poor\nstar HD140283. As seen in the figure, the NLTE abundance corrections for the Fe i lines\nare extremely large in the 3D model (\u223c 0.9 dex) and a bit smaller in the 1D case (\u223c 0.6\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ndex). On the other hand, it is very important to point out that NLTE effects on the iron\nabundance are most pronounced for the weak Fe ii lines. The four lines used by Nissen et al\n(2002) for their iron abundance determinations reveal strikingly large deviations from LTE.\nOn average, the NLTE abundance corrections for the Fe ii lines increase from \u223c 0.16 dex in\nthe 1D case to \u223c 0.4 dex in the 3D model.\nWhen NLTE effects are taken into account we find no difference between the mean\nFe i-based abundances obtained via the 1D and 3D models (log\u01eb(Fe)\u22485.77). Therefore,\nwhen NLTE effects are taken into account the Fe i lines formed in the 3D model are hardly\nsensitive to granulation inhomogeneities. However, for the Fe ii lines the 3D abundance\ncorrection (3D+NLTE \u2212 1D+NLTE) is significant - that is, 0.26 dex.\nWhen the LTE approximation is used the mean iron abundance obtained via spectrum\nsynthesis of Fe i lines in the 3D model is lower than for the 1D case (cf. Asplund et al. 1999;\nNissen et al. 2002). The differences between the 1D and 3D determinations depend on the\nlower excitation potential \u03c7 of the spectral line under consideration. They range from \u223c 0.6\ndex at \u03c7 \u2243 0 eV to \u223c 0.2 dex at \u03c7 \u223c 2 eV, while the mean difference is smaller (\u223c 0.3 dex).\nIn contrast, on average the Fe ii lines are insensitive to 3D effects when LTE is assumed.\n\n8.\n\nRevising the stellar parameters\n\nThere are several discrepancies indicating that the iron abundance obtained in Sect. 7.2\nfor the star HD 140283 cannot be considered as reliable, neither in the 1D case nor in the 3D\ncase. For example, we have (1) a divergence of the average abundances derived from both\nionization stages, (2) a correlation of the abundances derived from Fe i lines with the lowerlevel excitation potential and (3) a large scatter in the abundances derived from Fe ii lines\n(particularly, the weak ones). The elimination of any of such discrepancies cannot be simply\nachieved in terms of uncertainties in observed equivalent widths, oscillator strengths, inelastic\nelectron collisional rates and photoionization cross sections. Our numerical experiments\nshow that the typical errors introduced by uncertainties in such quantities do not exceed 0.1\ndex (see Shchukina and Trujillo Bueno 2001). The iron abundance error that results from\nneglecting the UV haze opacity for the metal-poor star HD140283 is even smaller than 0.1\ndex. In our opinion, a reasonable possibility for explaining the reported discrepancies is to\nrevise the stellar parameters of the subgiant HD140283.\nIn this section we aim at finding the \"best-choice\" of stellar parameters for the star\nHD140283, both for the NLTE and LTE cases. It is important to emphasize from the\noutset that in our NLTE computations we have neglected inelastic collisions with neutral\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nhydrogen atoms for excitation and ionization. At present, there are no reliable values for\nthe ensuing collisional rates. The often-used classical Drawin (1968) formula leads to very\nuncertain estimates and to a substantial overestimation of the collisional rates when detailed\nquantum mechanical and/or laboratory data is available, such as for Li and Na (see Biberman\net al. 1987; Lambert 1993; Holweger 1996; Barklem et al. 1998, 2003; Belyayev et al.\n1999; Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001; Asplund et al. 2004), which explains why the\nconclusions of Gratton et al. (1999) have been critized. Obviously, inelastic collisions with\nneutral hydrogen atoms would tend to reduce the NLTE effects. Therefore, the difference\nbetween the NLTE and LTE iron abundances may be considered as the maximum effect\nthat inelastic collisions might produce. In our opinion, the tentative conclusion of Korn,\nShi & Gehren (2003), achieved via a 1D+NLTE analysis, that hydrogen collisions might\nbe efficient in the atmosphere of HD140283 needs to be re-investigated in the light of 3D\nhydrodynamical models because, as pointed out by these authors, the lower temperatures of\nthe 3D models would alleviate their need of invoking thermalizing collisions to counterbalance\nphotoionization.\nOur analysis for the revision of the stellar parameter is based on the following criteria:\ni) the average abundances obtained from Fe i and Fe ii lines have to be equal.\nii) the \"best choice\" solution has to give the minimum mean standard deviation (\u03c3) for\nthe abundances derived from Fe i and Fe ii lines.\niii) abundances have to be independent of the lower excitation potential (\u03c7). We restrict\nourselves to revise only the metallicity and the effective temperature. The given surface\ngravity of the star HD140283 is reliable, since it has been obtained from accurate Hipparcos\nparallaxes.\nFigure 5 helps us to find the \"best-choice\" of stellar parameters for the star HD140283.\nThe left panels show the variation of the Fe i and Fe ii abundances with metalicity, Teff ,\nand logg in a suitable grid of 1D model atmospheres. Our results clearly demonstrate that\nchanges in Teff seriously affect the Fe i-based abundances. However, such changes in Teff are\nunimportant for abundance determinations from Fe ii lines. On the other hand, the Fe iibased abundances are slightly sensitive to the changes in logg, which is not the case for the\nabundances obtained from Fe ii lines. In addition, the dependence on metallicity is more\npronounced for Fe i lines, while for Fe ii lines there is no such a variation. It is interesting\nto note that when LTE is assumed, then only the correlation of the inferred Fe i abundances\nwith Teff is present.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n8.1.\n\nStellar parameter determinations: 1D case\n\nConsider first the 1D+LTE modeling case for the iron lines. Figure 5 (middle panel to\nthe lhs) and Fig. 4 (bottom panel to the rhs) show that in this case identical abundances\nfrom both Fe i and Fe ii lines could be obtained around Teff close to 5700 K. In fact, our\ndetailed analysis gives Teff \u2243 5670 K and [Fe/H]\u2243 \u22122.3. With these stellar parameters Fe iibased abundances turn out to be insignificantly scattered (\u03c3 \u223c 0.1 dex) around the average\nvalue. However, the abundances derived from Fe i lines show a sensitivity to the lower-level\nexcitation potential (\u03c7) that is similar to the trend seen in the bottom panel to the rhs of\nFig. 4.\nSecondly, consider the 1D+NLTE modeling case. In order to reach a good agreement\nbetween NLTE abundances derived from Fe i and Fe ii lines we would have to reduce the\neffective temperature down to Teff = 5450 K and to increase the stellar metallicity up to\n[Fe/H]\u2243 \u22122.1. With such stellar parameters the \u03c7-dependence of the Fe i abundances vanishes. However, the abundances derived from Fe ii lines become undesirably spread around\nthe mean value (\u03c3 \u223c 0.3 dex).\n\n8.2.\n\nStellar parameter determinations: 3D case\n\nIn order to achieve a reasonable estimation of the \"best choice\" of stellar parameters\nthe curves of Fig. 5 (left panels) have to be corrected for the 3D effects of granulation\ninhomogeneities. This means that we need to know how the 3D abundance corrections change\nwith [Fe/H], Teff and logg for both the LTE and NLTE cases. Unfortunately, a suitable grid\nof 3D models for several effective temperatures and metalicities similar to that provided by\nKurucz for the 1D case is not yet available, besides the fact that NLTE computations in\n3D are presently very computationally costly. However, we can try to estimate the true\nstellar parameters of the star HD140283 via the following strategy, which is inspired by our\nconclusion that 3D effects are important for the Fe i lines only if LTE is assumed and that\n3D effects are relevant for the Fe ii lines only when we allow for departures from LTE.\nFirstly, let us choose the 3D+LTE modeling approach. As we have seen, if LTE is\nassumed then the Fe i lines are sensitive to the 3D effects while the Fe ii lines are not.\nTherefore, if the LTE approximation is used it is much safer to revise the stellar parameters\nvia iron abundances derived from Fe ii lines. We find Teff \u2248 5700 and [Fe/H]\u2248 \u22122.3 (see the\nbottom panel to the rhs of Fig. 4).\nSecondly, consider the 3D+NLTE approach. It is obvious that in this case we better\navoid the use of Fe ii lines because we have shown that they are sensitive to both 3D\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nand NLTE effects. However, we have demonstrated also that at least for the available\n3D model of the star HD140283 the NLTE iron abundance derived from Fe i lines is very\nsimilar to that obtained via the 1D+NLTE modeling approach. For this reason, we think\nthat we can estimate the true stellar parameters by choosing Fe i lines and a 1D+NLTE\nmodeling approach. We find that the standard deviation \u03c3 minimizes at Teff \u2243 5600 K\nand [Fe/H]\u2243 \u22122. Now the mean iron abundance turns out to be log\u01eb(Fe) = 5.54 \u00b1 0.14.\nMoreover, the dependence of the derived iron abundances with \u03c7 becomes negligible.\n\n8.3.\n\nUncertainties in the determination of the stellar parameters and the\noxygen abundance\n\nAs we have just seen, depending on the approach used for modeling the iron lines we\nget four \"best choice\" sets for the stellar parameters of the star HD140283, with Teff in the\nrange \u2243 5450 \u2212 5700 K and [Fe/H] between \u22122.0 and \u22122.3 (see Table 4). How large could\nbe the impact of such uncertainties in the stellar parameters of the star HD140283 on the\ndetermination of the oxygen abundance? The right panels of Fig. 5 clarify this issue. We\ncan see that when 1D models are used then both the O i and [O i]-based abundances are\nsensitive to changes in Teff , but not too much to changes in logg and/or in metallicity. The\nsensitivity of the NLTE abundance corrections to these parameters (logg and metallicity)\nis much smaller. On average, they vary between 0.17 and 0.19 dex for O i lines, while it is\nnegligible for the [O i] line (< 0.01 dex). Our 1D+NLTE modeling of oxygen lines shows\nthat abundances derived from O i and [O i] lines give the same value (i.e., log\u01eb(O) = 7.15)\nfor Teff = 5650 K. We now point out that among our \"best choice\" sets of stellar parameters\nonly one has a Teff -value (Teff = 5450 K) which considerably deviates from that with 5650\nK. Such relatively low value for the effective temperature (i.e., Teff = 5450 K) causes a large\ndisagreement between the NLTE O i and [O i]-based abundances amounting to \u223c 0.34 dex.\nMoreover, as we have indicated above the set of parameters Teff = 5450 K and [Fe/H]= \u22122.1\nproduces an unpleasant scatter of the Fe ii-based abundances around the mean value. In view\nof these factors we think reasonable to eliminate such particular set of stellar parameters.\nThe remaining three sets of stellar parameters, i.e. Teff = 5670 K & [Fe/H]= \u22122.3,\nTeff = 5700 K & [Fe/H]= \u22122.3, and Teff = 5600 K & [Fe/H]= \u22122.0, correspond to the case\nof 1D+LTE modeling for both Fe i and Fe ii lines, to 3D+LTE modeling of Fe ii lines, and\nto 3D+NLTE modeling of Fe i lines, respectively. It is important to note that this range of\neffective temperatures is similar to the typical uncertainty in the determination of Teff via the\napplication of the infrared flux method. The small differences in the effective temperature\nimplies a rather small oxygen abundance variation. In particular, our 1D+NLTE oxygen\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nabundance determination from the O i IR lines using the former set gives log\u01eb(O) = 7.13,\nwhile the latter set leads to log\u01eb(O) = 7.20. For the [O i] line we get log\u01eb(O) = 7.16 and\nlog\u01eb(O) = 7.11, respectively.\nWe must consider now how the dependencies shown for the oxygen lines in the rhs\npanels of Fig. 5 are going to be modified due to the effect of granulation inhomogeneities.\nAs mentioned above, a major obstacle to investigate this point is the lack of a suitable grid\nof 3D models. In any case, this 3D issue concerns especially the [O i] line given its significant\nsensitivity to granulation inhomogeneities. According to Nissen et al. (2002) the main effect\nis due to differences in the continuum opacities between the 1D and 3D models. Since the\nopacity is provided primarily by H\u2212 atoms the strength of the weak [O i] line turns out to\nbe inversely proportional to electron density. In the 3D hydrodynamical model of the star\nHD140283, which has been obtained assuming Teff = 5700 K and [Fe/H]= \u22122.5, the deficit of\nelectrons is particularly large in the cool surface layers of the granular regions, while it is less\npronounced in both the intergranular plasma and in the 1D model. As a result, the spatially\naveraged equivalent width of the [O i] line in such a 3D model increases and, consequently, the\nderived oxygen abundance decreases in comparison with the 1D modeling result. Obviously,\nthe 3D correction obtained in Sect. 6.2 for this forbidden line assuming that the stellar\nparameters are Teff = 5700 K and [Fe/H]= \u22122.5 cannot be used for the 3D+NLTE case with\nlower effective temperature (Teff = 5600 K) and higher metalicity ([Fe/H]= \u22122.0).\nAs pointed out by Asplund et al. (1999) the deficit in the number density of electrons\ndepends mainly on the metalicity. 3D hydrodynamical simulations for higher [Fe/H] values\nwill have larger surface temperatures and electron densities. Thus, one can expect that at\n[Fe/H]= \u22122 the 3D abundance correction for the [O i] line has to be smaller. Obviously, the\nexact value of such corrections will have to await the development of a new 3D model for\nthe revised stellar parameters. It should be noted that such a sensitivity to 3D effects may\nbe assumed also for the UV lines of OH. However, the impact on 3D abundance corrections\nwhen changing the metallicity from \u22122.5 to \u22122.0 seems to be rather small if we suppose\nthat the results obtained by Asplund & Garc\u0131\u0301a P\u00e9rez (2001) for dwarfs can be applied to the\nsubgiant HD140283 (see their Table 2, which shows that the 3D effects on the UV lines of\nOH is \u223c \u22120.5 at [Fe/H]= \u22122 and \u223c \u22120.6 at [Fe/H]= \u22123). The additional conclusion that\nfollows from their Table 2 is a high sensitivity of the oxygen abundances derived from the\nOH molecules to the metallicity of the star. As a result, a 3D model with higher metallicity\n([Fe/H]= \u22122) might bring the oxygen abundances derived from molecules (log\u01eb(O) = 7.20\nfor Teff \u2248 5800) to closer agreement with the abundance derived from the O i triplet (\nlog\u01eb(O) \u2248 7.20 for Teff = 5600 K.)\nAn extra problem is related with observations of the [O i] line in the star HD140283.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nAccording to Nissen et al. (2002) this weak line (W \u2243 0.5 m\u00c5) is blended with a stronger H2 O\nline (W \u2248 1 m\u00c5). These authors estimated that the available equivalent width measurements\nhave an uncertainty of \u00b10.2 \u2212 \u00b10.3 m\u00c5 . Such an uncertainty is very large, because it is\nabout 50% of the observed equivalent width, and implies an uncertainty of \u00b10.13\u2212\u00b10.19 dex\nin the derived oxygen abundance (Fig. 5, middle right panel).\nAlternatively, in a first approximation we could neglect the sensitivity of the O i lines\nto the granulation inhomogeneities. Furthermore, the observation errors for these lines in\nHD140283 are relatively small. For example, the observed equivalent widths of the O i\ntriplet that have been published in the literature (Abia & Rebolo 1989; Tomkin et al. 1992;\nNissen et al. 2002; G. Israelian, private communication), and which we have used in our\ninvestigation, differ by about \u00b11 m\u00c5. Their impact on the derived oxygen abundance lies in\nthe range \u00b10.06 dex (Fig. 5, middle right panel). It is clear that the O i lines seem to be the\nmost reliable lines for deriving the oxygen abundance in the star HD140283.\nTherefore, when the stellar parameters are revised neglecting 3D and NLTE effects for\nthe iron lines, and when the oxygen abundance derived from the O i lines is corrected for\nNLTE effects, then the mean value of the oxygen-to-iron ratio seems to be [O/Fe]\u2243 0.7\nat [Fe/H]=\u22122.3. This value is in good agreement with the quasi-linear trend of [O/Fe] vs.\n[Fe/H] obtained by Nissen et al. (2002) using standard 1D modeling. However, the key point\nto keep in mind is that a 3D+NLTE modeling of the O i IR triplet (using the 3D+NLTE\nstellar parameters derived from the Fe i lines) would give [O/Fe]\u2243 0.5 at [Fe/H]=\u22122.0.\nObviously, the analysis of a single metal-poor star is not enough to opt for one of the\nfollowing two possibilities: (a) a linear rise in the [O/Fe] ratio vs. metallicity (see, e.g., Fig.\n11 of Israelian et al. 2001) or (b) a plateau between 0.4 and 0.5 dex in the metallicity range\n-3<[Fe/H]< \u22121. 3 However, we think that our investigation indicates the \"road to be taken\"\ntowards the resolution of the problem.\n3\n\nWe point out that with the stellar parameters used by Asplund et al. (1999) for the 3D modelling of the\nstar HD140283 (i.e., Teff = 5700 and [Fe/H]=\u22122.5) the NLTE oxygen abundance (log\u01eb(O) = 7.08 \u00b1 0.06)\nderived from the O i IR triplet and the NLTE Fe i-based iron abundance (log\u01eb(Fe) = 5.77 \u00b1 0.186) leads to\na small oxygen-to-iron ratio ([O/Fe]\u223c 0.1 dex). Moreover, there is no overabundance of oxygen at all if one\nuses the [O i]-based abundance. It is also of interest to mention that in our preliminary study (see Shchukina\net al. 2003) we obtained a slightly larger value for [O/Fe] because we used a smaller number of Fe i lines.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n9.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have derived the solar oxygen abundance from the O i IR triplet using Asplund's\net al. (2000) 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere and a NLTE modeling\napproach. We find log\u01eb(O) = 8.70\u00b10.06, which is in good agreement with the determinations\nof Allende Prieto et al. (2001), Shchukina et al. (2003) and Asplund et al. (2004). Actually,\nif for the O i IR triplet we use the same oscillator strengths adopted by Asplund et al. (2004)\nwe then obtain a value very similar to that reported by them (i.e., log\u01eb(O) = 8.65).\nIn agreement with previous investigations, we confirm that LTE synthesis of Fe i lines\nin the 3D hydrodynamical model of this star gives flux profiles significantly different from\nthose obtained in a 1D model for the same stellar parameters. However, when the LTE\napproximation is used for the synthesis of Fe ii lines we find negligible differences between\nthe 1D and 3D cases.\nThe differences between the iron abundances obtained from Fe i lines when assuming\nLTE in the 1D and 3D models of the star HD140283 turn out to depend on the lower excitation potential of the spectral line under consideration. The NLTE abundance corrections\nfor Fe i lines are significant, especially for the low-excitation lines in the 3D model.\nWe have three particularly important results concerning the determination of the iron\nabundance in metal poor stars like HD140283:\n(1) If NLTE effects are taken into account when synthetizing the Fe i lines in the 1D\nand 3D models of this star, then the derived iron abundance turns out to be practically the\nsame in both cases.\n(2) Contrary to a generally accepted belief, the Fe ii lines turn out to be significantly\naffected by NLTE effects. In particular, a full NLTE modeling should be carried out for the\nFe ii lines with upper levels of odd parity starting from z 6 Do , and especially the weaker lines.\n(3) The iron abundance of the star HD140283 is estimated to be \u223c 0.5 dex higher than\npreviously thought.\nFor the O i IR triplet the NLTE correction of the oxygen abundance in the 1D and 3D\nmodels is practically the same and less than 0.2 dex. Such a NLTE correction is negligible\nfor the [O i] line. We have confirmed that the mean value of the oxygen abundance derived\nfrom the O i IR lines is insensitive to 3D effects, while such effects reduce the abundance\nderived from the [O i] line by \u223c 0.2 dex.\nWith the here presented NLTE calculations for Fe and O, both the 1D and 3D models\nlead to inconsistencies in the iron and oxygen abundance determinations. The discrepancies\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nin the derived iron and oxygen abundances cannot be removed by taking into account NLTE\nand/or 3D effects. This result has led us to investigate whether these discrepancies can be\nresolved by a modification of the stellar parameters of the star HD140283. We have shown\nthat previous studies may have underestimated the metallicity of this star and overestimated\nits effective temperature. We find [Fe/H]\u2243 \u22122.0 (instead of [Fe/H]\u2243 \u22122.5) and Teff = 5600\n(instead of Teff = 5700). With these new stellar parameters the iron and oxygen abundances\nin the star HD140283 would be log\u01eb(Fe) = 5.54\u00b10.14 and log\u01eb(O) = 7.20\u00b10.06, respectively.\nTaking into account the low value for the solar oxygen abundance (i.e., log\u01eb\u2299 (O)=8.70\u00b10.06)\nand our previously determined value of the solar iron abundance (i.e., log\u01eb\u2299 (Fe)=7.50 \u00b10.10;\nsee Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001) we find that the oxygen-to-iron abundance ratio is\n[O/Fe] \u2248 0.5 at [Fe/H]=\u22122.\nBesides the reported NLTE effects for the Fe ii lines, our main conclusion here is that the\nmetalicity of this type of metal-poor stars might well be significantly larger than previously\nthought. Obviously, the analysis of a single metal-poor star is not enough to fully resolve\nthe puzzling behavior of the O/Fe ratio in metal-poor stars. However, we think that the\npresent investigation at least indicates the road to be taken.\nWe are very grateful to Ram\u00f3n Garc\u0131\u0301a L\u00f3pez and Garik Israelian for allowing us to use\ntheir stellar observations of iron and oxygen lines.

Left panel: Representative \"granular\" point. Right panel: Representative\n\"intergranular\" point. The solid lines indicate the \u03b2-coefficients for the Fe i levels with excitation potentials below 5 eV. The dashed and dashed-dotted lines refer to the \u03b2-coefficients\nof the lower and upper levels of the Fe ii lines in Table 1, respectively. The thick lines correspond to the Fe i ground level a5 D, to the Fe ii ground level a6 D, and to the Fe ii excited\nlevel of odd parity z 6 Do , respectively. Arrows mark the representative atmospheric heights\nbelow which one of the Fe i lines (\u03bb5429.699 \u00c5) and the Fe ii lines from Table 1 originate in\nthe NLTE and LTE cases. Note that such NLTE and LTE heights are nearly the same for\nthe Fe ii lines.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The emergent disk-center intensity profiles of the Fe i line \u03bb5429.699 \u00c5 calculated\nin the 3D hydrodynamical model of the metal-poor star HD140283. Left panels correspond\nto the NLTE case, while the righ panels to LTE. Top panels: the wavelength variation of the\nemergent intensity that one would be able to extract at each point along the spectrograph's\nslit if the 'surface' of the star HD140283 could be spatially resolved. The \"wiggles\" are caused\nby the Doppler shifts associated with the velocity flows of the stellar granulation pattern.\nBright strips correspond to granules, while dark ones to intergranules. The hypothetical slit\nis located along the position Y=24 in the 3D model. Intensities are given in absolute energy\nunits (erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ster\u22121 Hz\u22121 ). Black lines show variations of the line equivalent widths W\nalong the slit. Bottom panels: The spatially resolved emergent intensity profiles at each\nof the 50 surface gridpoints considered. The thick solid lines with filled circles show the\nresulting spatially averaged intensity.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The flux profiles of the weak Fe ii line at 6247.56 \u00c5 (top panels) and of the moderately strong Fe ii line at 5316.62 \u00c5 (bottom panels) calculated in the 3D hydrodynamical\nmodel of the metal-poor star HD140283 (logg = 3.7, Teff = 5700 K and [Fe/H]= \u22122.5). The\nprofiles were synthesized using the iron abundance corresponding to the metallicity log\u01eb=5.0.\nLeft panels show the results for the NLTE case while the right panels refer to the LTE calculations. Individual thin curves show the computed emergent fluxes for the \"granular\" and\n\"intergranular\" models corresponding to the 50 spatial grid points situated along one of the\nY -directions in the 3D model atmosphere of the metal-poor subgiant HD140283. The thick\nsolid line with filled circles in each of the panels shows the resulting spatially averaged flux.\nFluxes are given in absolute energy units (erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ). The profiles associated with\nthe dark intergranular lanes of the stellar granulation have a redshift and a lower continuum\nflux. Bright granules are characterized by a higher continuum flux and a blue line shift.\nNote that the flux profile of the Fe ii line at 6247.56 \u00c5 is observed in absorption (W > 0)\nwhile the synthesized NLTE flux profile turns out to be in emission (calculated W < 0).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The iron abundances derived from Fe i lines (filled circles) and from Fe ii lines\n(stars) vs. the lower level excitation potential of the chosen spectral lines. Left panels\nshow the results for the 3D model atmosphere of the star HD140283 while the right panels\nfor the 1D model. Top panels: NLTE. Bottom panels: LTE. The four weak Fe ii lines\n(\u03bb\u03bb6149.238, 6247.562, 6432.654, 6456.376 m\u00c5) used by Nissen et al. (2002) are marked with\nsquares. The dashed and dotted horizontal lines indicate the mean abundances found from\nthe set of Fe i and Fe ii lines, respectively. The corresponding values of the mean abundances\nand their standard deviation are given inside the panels.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The computed abundances vs. the metallicity (top), vs. the effective temperature (middle), and vs. the stellar surface gravity (bottom) for the set of 1D stellar model\natmospheres. Left panels: results for iron, with the solid and dashed lines indicating the\nmean Fe i- and Fe ii-based abundances, respectively. Right panels: results for oxygen, with\nthe solid and dashed lines indicating the mean oxygen abundances derived from the infrared\ntriplet \u03bb7772-5 \u00c5 and the oxygen abundance obtained from the forbidden [O i] \u03bb6300 \u00c5 line.\nThick lines in each of the panels correspond to NLTE while thin lines to LTE. The standard\ndeviations (\u03c3) for the observed equivalent widths of the O i and [O i] lines are shown in the\nmiddle panel. It is also of interest to note that our LTE+1D calculations show that the lower\nthe effective temperature the larger the discrepancy in the iron abundance derived from Fe\ni and Fe ii lines (see the thin lines in the middle panel to the lhs of the figure).\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nTable 1. O i, Fe i and Fe ii line list and observed equivalent widths (W ) from the\nmetal-poor star HD140283. The oscillator strengths for the O i IR triplet are from Kurucz\n& Bell (1995), while that for the forbidden [O i] line is from Lambert (1978). The\nwavelengths and excitation energies of the Fe lines are from Moore (1959). The Fe\noscillator strengths were taken from Fuhr et al. (1988), except for Fe i \u03bb4733.596 \u00c5 and\nFe ii \u03bb\u03bb5197.569, 5234.620, 6149.238, 6456.376 \u00c5 which stem from Gurtovenko & Kostik\n(1989). The observed equivalent widths of all the Fe i lines and of 11 Fe ii lines have been\nkindly provided to us by R. Garc\u0131\u0301a L\u00f3pez (private communication), while the equivalent\nwidths of the remaining Fe ii lines have been taken from Table 3 of Nissen et al.
