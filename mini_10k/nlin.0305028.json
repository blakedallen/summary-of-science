Its connection with classical chaos in\nsemiclassical regime has also been discussed [2, 3]. A\nnumber of works were devoted to semiclassical chaos assisted tunneling between symmetry related KAM-tori in\nsystems with mixed dynamics (well developed chaotic region coexists in phase space with regular islands) [4, 5, 6].\nTo describe chaos assisted tunneling in systems with\nmixed dynamics multi-level model Hamiltonian, primarily proposed in [2], is often used [7]. Less attention has\nbeen payed to semiclassical tunneling in KAM systems\n(chaotic region is not widespread) [8]. Another way to\ndescribe semiclassical tunneling is based on solutions of\nHamilton equations in imaginary time and path integral\nformalism [1]. Instanton technique [9] was used in a very\nfew works [10].\nIn this work we consider one-dimensional quantum system with periodic in space potential affected by small\nperiodic in time perturbation. We use methods created\nto describe chaos in classical Hamiltonian systems to investigate essentially quantum phenomenon of tunneling.\nIt is achieved in the framework of instanton technique,\nwhere solutions of Euclidian equations of motion (instantons) play dominating role, by the use of standard methods from the viewpoint of chaos [11]. For the systems\nwith periodic in time perturbation energy is no more\nan exact integral of motion and the language of quasienergies is more adequate [12]. For some estimations\nenergy as an adiabatic invariant can also be used [13].\nWe study properties of chaotic instanton solutions and\ncalculate the form of the spectrum and the lower bound\nfor the width of the ground quasi-energy zone.\nHamiltonian of the system under consideration is taken\nin the form\n+\u221e\nX\n1\nH\u0303 = p\u03032 + \u03c902 cos x \u2212 \u01ebx\n\u03b4(t \u2212 nT\u0303 ),\n2\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nT\u0303 is the real time period of perturbation, \u01eb describes the\nstrength of perturbation. The mass of the particle equals\n\nunit. Considered cosine potential corresponds nonlinear\noscillator. Phase space of nonlinear oscillator has the\ntopology of cylinder (points (q, p\u0303) and (q + 2\u03c0, p\u0303) are\nidentified). Thus its (quasi-)energy spectrum is discrete.\nChaos assisted tunneling between two major resonance\nislands (inside single potential well) for driven nonlinear\noscillator has been studied numerically in [4]. In this\nwork we study the system with x varying from \u2212\u221e to\n+\u221e. This results in band structure of the (quasi-)energy\nspectrum [14]. Systems with spatially periodic potential\nwere studied in the instanton physics [15]. Perturbation\nused in (1) was exploited in the systems exhibiting quantum chaos [16, 17].\nThere are papers devoted chaos assisted tunneling\nwhere some analytical predictions for billiard systems\nbasing on the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics are made [3]. Distinguishing feature of our work\nis analytical predictions for the system with smooth potential exploring for this purpose instanton technique\nadopted from quantum field theory [9].\nANALYSIS OF CHAOTIC INSTANTON\nSOLUTIONS\n\nFor applying instanton technique we consider solutions\nof classical equations of motion in imaginary (Euclidian)\ntime. Hamiltonian (1) has the same form (translated on\n\u03c0) in Euclidian time as in real one.\nEuclidian Hamiltonian of the system is H = H0 + V ,\nwhere\nH0 =\n\n1 2\np \u2212 \u03c902 cos x,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nand\nV = \u03b1T x\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 nT ).\n\n(3)\n\nHere H0 is nonperturbed Euclidian Hamiltonian of the\nsystem and V is the Euclidian potential of the perturbation. We also introduced coupling constant \u03b1 \u226a 1\ninstead of \u01eb \u2261 \u03b1T in order to simplify formulas.\n\n\f2\nNonperturbed instanton solution describes the motion\non the separatrix of the Hamiltonian (2). It is well known\nthat this separatrix is destroyed by any periodic perturbation and on its place stochastic layer is appeared [13].\nPerturbed instanton solutions correspond to the motion\nin vicinity of the separatrix inside the layer. Therefore instead of one instanton solution connecting neighbor maxima of nonperturbed Euclidian potential (classical vacuum states in real time potential) we obtain a manyfold\nof instanton solutions of Euclidian equations placed inside the stochastic layer.\nWe calculate parameter of local instability, width of\nstochastic layer and correlator for perturbed instanton\nsolutions. It is convenient to describe dynamics of the\nsystem in action-angle variables [11]. Equation of motion\nfor action variable has the form\n!\n+\u221e\nX\n\u03b1\u1e8b\n \u0307\n2\ncos (m\u03bd\u03c4 ) + 1 .\n(4)\nI =\u2212\n\u03c9\nm=1\n\nHere \u03c9(I) \u2261 dH0 /dI is the nonlinear frequency [11]. Instead of angle variable we introduce phase of external\nforce \u03c8 defined by the relation \u03c8\u0307 = \u03bd \u2261 2\u03c0/T [13].\nLet Hs \u2261 \u03c902 to denote the energy of nonperturbed\nsystem on the separatrix. Continuous equations of motion for I and \u03c8 can be reduced to discrete mapping for\nthe phase of external force in the vicinity of separatrix\n(|H \u2212 Hs | \u226a 1) [13, 16, 17]\n\u03c8n+1 = \u03c8n + Bn + K0 sin \u03c8n ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nK0 =\n\n8\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd e\u2212\u03c0\u03bd/2\u03c90\n,\n\u03c90 |H \u2212 Hs |\n\nBn are some functions of H which exact form is not essential for our purposes. We assume following [13] that\ndue to small value of perturbation the energy practically\ndoes not change with time and equals the energy of the\nnonperturbed system. The map (5) with arbitrary parameter K0 was studied by many authors, for instance\n[16]. Particulary, it is known that at K0 > 1 motion\nis locally unstable and chaotic, whereas at K0 \u2264 1 it is\nstable and regular. Thus K0 is the parameter of local\ninstability. Condition K0 \u223c 1 enables us to calculate the\nwidth of stochastic layer\n8\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd \u2212\u03c0\u03bd/2\u03c90\n,\n(6)\ne\n|Hs \u2212 Hb | =\n\u03c90\nhere Hb is the energy value on the bound of stochastic\nlayer.\nTo calculate correlator for perturbed instanton solutions we use standard technique [18]. For the map (5)\ncorrelator is\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nd\u03c80 exp {i(\u03c8(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c80 )}\nR(\u03c4, \u03c40 ) =\n2\u03c0 0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40\n,\n(7)\n\u223c exp \u2212\n\u03c4R\n\nhere \u03c80 \u2261 \u03c8(\u03c40 ) and the time of correlations decay is\n\u03c4R = 2\u03c0/(\u03c9 ln K0 ). Exponential decrease of correlator\nshows that dynamics of the instanton solutions inside the\nstochastic layer (K0 > 1) possesses the property of mixing (chaos) [11].\nNote that perturbed one-instanton solution due to\nstochastic layer connects not only neighbor vacua of real\ntime potential but also two arbitrary chosen vacua. Remind that to describe tunneling between non-neighbor\nvacua of nonperturbed system one has to take into account contribution of multi-instanton configurations [15].\n\nTHE CALCULATION OF THE TUNNELING\nAMPLITUDE AND GROUND ZONE WIDTH\n\nLet us consider the tunneling between neighbor vacua\n(from x \u2248 \u2212\u03c0 to x \u2248 \u03c0 for distinctness) in presence of\nperturbation (3). In Euclidian time this tunneling process for the nonperturbed system is described by the solution of Euclidian equations of motion with asymptotes\nx = \u2212\u03c0, p = 0 at \u03c4 = \u2212\u221e and x = \u03c0, p = 0 at\n\u03c4 = +\u221e. There is only one solution satisfying these\nconditions for nonperturbed system (2) (one-instanton\nsolution)\nxinst\n(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ) = \u2212\u03c0 + 4 arctan e\u03c90 (\u03c4 \u2212\u03c40 ) .\n0\n\n(8)\n\nIts Euclidian action is S inst = 8\u03c90 . The instanton's\nposition is denoted by \u03c40 . Due to Euclidian equations\nwhen time is inof motion and anti-symmetry of xinst\n0\nverted with respect to the point \u03c40 perturbation (3) does\nnot change the Euclidian action of the one-instanton solution (8) in the first order on the coupling constant\ninst\nSpert\n= S inst + O(\u03b12 ). The only manifestation of the\nperturbation in this approximation is the appearance of\na number of the additional solutions of Euclidian equations of motion with energies close to the energy of nonperturbed one-instanton solution and placed inside the\nstochastic layer.\nLet us consider firstly nonperturbed system at arbitrary energy \u2212\u03c902 + \u03b5, 0 < \u03b5 < 2\u03c902 . One half of truncated instanton action can be easily calculated\n\ninst\n\nS[x\n\na(\u03b5)\nZ\nq\n2(\u03c902 cos x \u2212 (\u2212\u03c902 + \u03b5)) dx =\n(\u03c4, \u03b5)] =\n\u2212a(\u03b5)\n\nq\n= 4 4\u03c902 \u2212 2\u03b5E\nwhere \u00b1a(\u03b5) = \u00b1 arcsin\n\n1\na(\u03b5),\n1 \u2212 2\u03c9\u03b5 2\n\nq\n1\u2212\n\n0\n\n\u03b5\n2\u03c902\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nare turning points,\n\nfunction E is the elliptic integral of the second kind.\n\n\f3\nThen tunneling amplitude in perturbed system can be\nfound by integration over energy of the tunneling amplitude in nonperturbed system with the action (9)\nx(\u03c4\n\u2206H\nZ )\u2248\u03c0\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nDx exp \u2212S[xinst (\u03c4, \u03b5)] ,\nd\u03b5\nA=\n0\n\n(10)\n\nx(\u03c4 )\u2248\u2212\u03c0\n\nwhere \u2206H = 2|Hs \u2212 Hb | is the stochastic layer width.\nThe contribution of the chaotic instanton solutions is\ntaken into account by means of integration over \u03b5. Expression (10) shows that the probability of tunneling\n(square of the absolute value of the tunneling amplitude)\ngrows while chaotic region spreads (\u2206H increases).\nThe result is obtained in the first order on coupling\nconstant \u03b1 and does not take into account possible struc-\n\nture of stochastic layer is valid if the layer is narrow\nand is in agreement with results of numerical [20] and\nreal [6] experiments for similar problems. We have also\ncorrespondence in (10) with the nonperturbed case [15].\nNamely, if \u03b1 = 0 then \u2206H = 0 and the single solution\ndescribing the motion on the separatrix (nonperturbed\none-instanton solution) contributes to the tunneling amplitude.\nFormula (10) can be made more transparent if we use\nthe approximate form of action (9) at \u03b5 < 2\u03c902\nS[xinst (\u03c4, \u03b5)] \u2248 8\u03c90 \u2212\n\n\u03c0\u03b5\n.\n\u03c90\n\nThen in Gauss approximation we obtain the following\nexpression for the tunneling amplitude\n\n+\u221e\n\u2206H\nZ\nZ\np\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u03c0\u2206H\ninst \u221a\nd\u03b5\ndc0 S[xinst (\u03c4, \u03b5)] exp \u2212S[xinst (\u03c4, \u03b5)] \u2248 e\u2212S\nA=\nS inst \u0393F = 8\u03c90 \u0393e\u22128\u03c90 e \u03c90 .\n0\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere integration over c0 gives the contribution of zero\nmodes, \u0393 is a time of the tunneling. Formula (12) up to\nthe factor i has the same form in real Minkovski time.\nExpression (12) can \u0010be interpreted\nin the following\n\u0011\n\n> 1 in (12) differs perway. Factor F = exp \u03c0\u2206H\n\u03c90\nturbed and nonperturbed amplitudes and includes the\ncontribution of the layer. One can think about F as a\nnumber of instanton solutions inside the stochastic layer.\nWe can find the minimal number of instanton solutions inside the stochastic layer. One can not distinguish\ninstanton solutions within energy interval \u2206E \u223c 1/\u2206\u03c4\n(Heisenberg uncertainty relation). Here \u2206\u03c4 \u223c \u03c90\u22121 denotes the time interval of observation. Thus the energy\ninterval between neighbor instantons is \u2206\u03b5 \u223c \u03c90 . Therefore parameter F can be found as follows\n\u2206H\n\u2206H\n(13)\n\u2248 e \u03c90 ,\n\u2206\u03b5\nwhere unit takes into account the nonperturbed separatrix.\nThe form of the spectrum of the lower quasi-energy\nzone is obtained using the amplitude (12) by means\nof standard technique (multi-instanton contributions are\ntaken into account) [15]:\ninst \u221a\n1\nS inst F cos \u03b8,\n(14)\nE\u03b8 \u2248 \u03c90 \u2212 2e\u2212S\n2\nhere continuous variable \u03b8 parametrizes levels of the\nground quasi-energy zone. Zone width\ninst \u221a\n\u2206E \u2248 4e\u2212S\nS inst F\n(15)\n\nF \u223c1+\n\ndiffers from the case of nonperturbed case by factor F\nreflecting the influence of perturbation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe applied theory of classical chaos for investigation of\nthe chaos assisted tunneling in terms of path integral formalism in imaginary time and instanton technique. We\nfound the parameter of local instability and the width of\nthe stochastic layer. Exponential decrease of the correlator for any perturbed instanton solution was also demonstrated, that means it to possess the property of mixing. Then properties of the stochastic layer and classical chaotic solutions in Euclidean space (chaotic instantons) were used for the calculation tunneling amplitude,\nground quasi-energy zone spectrum in the presence of the\nperturbation and the zone width.\nGeneral tendency for chaos assisted tunneling regime\n(in average \u2013 if we abstract from fluctuations) is the\nincrease of tunneling amplitude (probability) as the\nstrength of perturbation increases [6, 20]. It is confirmed\nhere. The reason is the growth of the width of the chaotic\nlayer and therefore the increase of the number of paths for\nparticle to travel from one regular region to another. For\nsmall energies in Gauss approximation tunneling amplitude is increased by the factor F > 1. The life-time of the\nparticle in the certain vacuum of the system decreases.\nIt is connected with the widening of the (quasi-)energy\nzone (15).\n\n\f4\nWe would like to emphasize that obtained results are\nnot consequences of the particular choice of the nonperturbed Hamiltonian (2) or perturbation (3). Qualitatively they are valid for more general class of onedimensional nonperturbed Hamiltonians with quadratic\ndependence on momentum and spatially periodic potential with single well in each period, as well as time dependence of homogeneous perturbation can be realized\nby any time periodic function. The reason is the universality of the separatrix destruction mechanism in these\npotentials affected by time-periodic perturbation [13].\nTunneling plays an important role in gauge field theories (instanton physics [9]). Experimental discovery\nof QCD instantons for example is an important problem [21]. Moreover it is known that classical gauge field\ntheories are inherently chaotic [22]. Therefore the study\nof chaos assisted instanton tunneling in gauge field theories based on chaos criterion in quantum field theory [23]\nis also of essential interest.\nAcknowledgements.
