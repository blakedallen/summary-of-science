This inefficiency\nin itself is a very good thing for the universe as a whole, since\nwithout it galaxies such as the Milky Way would very quickly exhaust their supplies of gas by converting it into stars. Recent estimates from the c2d Spitzer legacy survey of five nearby molecular clouds suggest that around 3 \u2212 6% of the available gas in a\nmolecular cloud is converted into stars in the local region of our\nGalaxy (Evans et al. 2009). Previous observational results suggest\nsimilarly low efficiencies: e.g., \u2248 1 \u2212 6% in Taurus (Evans & Lada\n1991; Onishi et al. 1998); < 13% in the clouds in Chamaeleon\n(Mizuno et al. 1999), though some dispersion in these results arises\nfrom the use of differing measures, whereas Evans et al. use a uniform definition of efficiency for all clouds.\nThe source of such uniformly low efficiency is poorly understood, and it remains unclear as to what the \"rate-limiting step\"\nin star formation really is, since inefficiency is apparently present\nat all levels, from the formation of molecular clouds in galaxies (Dobbs et al. 2008; Leroy et al. 2008) to the fact that only\nsmall, clustered regions of molecular clouds with mass fractions of\n<\n\u223c 20 percent (Lada 1992; Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004;\nHatchell et al. 2005) participate in star formation, to the observation that only a fraction of the mass in dense molecular cloud cores\nends up as stars (Benson & Myers 1989; Alves et al. 2007). Inspite\nof this, it is clear that a large part of the inefficiency lies within\nmolecular clouds themselves.\nc 2009 RAS\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, we have a very good idea of\nthe basic ingredients of the star formation process - namely gravity, gas dynamics, turbulence, magnetic fields, radiative and mechanical feedback, though their relative importance (particularly\nwith respect to magnetic fields and turbulence) remains vigourously\ndebated (e.g. Crutcher et al. 2009; Mouschovias & Tassis 2008;\nCrutcher et al. 2008). By definition star formation involves the conversion of gas into stars under self-gravity, the basics of which\nwere elucidated by Jeans (1902). The complication to the gas dynamics is the highly turbulent (and supersonic) nature of molecular\nclouds and the wide range of length and time scales over which star\nformation takes place, presenting a formidable challenge for numerical simulations even before considering other relevant physics.\nNevertheless, simulations including just self-gravity and hydrodynamics (Klessen, Burkert & Bate 1998; Bate, Bonnell & Bromm\n2002a,b, 2003; Bonnell, Bate & Vine 2003; Bate & Bonnell 2005;\nBate 2005) have been surprisingly successful in predicting many\nproperties of clustered star formation, including the initial mass\nfunction (though with an overproduction of brown dwarfs), multiplicity as a function of primary mass, the frequency of very low\nmass binaries, general trends for the separation and mass ratio distributions of binaries and the relative orbital orientations of triple\nsystems (Bate 2009a).\nHowever, the efficiency of star formation in these calculations\nwould be >\n\u223c 50% were the simulations left to run, since in the absence of stellar feedback there can be nothing to prevent all of the\n(bound) gas from eventually accreting onto the stars. While tidal\n\n\f2\n\nPrice & Bate\n\nforces from the underlying galactic potential may be a contributing factor in some cases (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2009), many\nsuggestions in the literature are related to the turbulence present\nin the cloud. Star formation in initially unbound clouds, where\nstar formation will nevertheless occur in the presence of a turbulent velocity field (Clark & Bonnell 2004; Clark et al. 2005), is one\nextreme. But sources of turbulent driving (e.g. Matzner & McKee\n2000; Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006; Nakamura & Li 2007),\nwhilst not strictly changing the overall efficiency in a bound cloud,\ncan dramatically alter the fraction of a cloud which is unstable to\ngravitational collapse in a given dynamical time, decreasing the efficiency per free-fall time (e.g. Padoan 1995; Klessen et al. 2000;\nKrumholz & McKee 2005). This occurs naturally in turbulent models because there is a spectrum of density fluctuations, of which\nonly a small fraction is in sub-regions dense enough to be Jeansunstable. Star formation is thus made inefficient, in a per free-fall\ntime sense, because turbulence produces in a given dynamical time\na range of clumps (or \"cores\"), only some of which are bound and\nwill collapse (Klessen et al. 2000). There is still a difficulty, however, which is that if this is to work for dense, globally bound regions, one has to keep driving the turbulent motions (either from\noutside or within) otherwise the turbulence will quickly decay and\nthe gas from the whole dense globally bound clump will eventually\nbe used up in star formation.\nMagnetic fields have long been recognised as a key ingredient\nin star formation (Mestel & Spitzer 1956; Shu et al. 1987; Mestel\n1999), given that observations robustly measure fields at sufficient\nstrengths that they are close to preventing star formation altogether\n(Mac Low & Klessen 2004), and robustly in the regime where\nmagnetic pressure is dominant over gas pressure (Crutcher 1999;\nBourke et al. 2001; Heiles & Troland 2005). The importance of the\nlatter point is easily overlooked and implies that, even if magnetic\nfields do not prevent global gravitational collapse in a molecular\ncloud, they can nevertheless act as the dominant source of pressure\n(Price & Bate 2008), supporting large fractions of the cloud and\nperhaps regulating star formation (Nakamura & Li 2005). Magnetic fields, may also have important effects on the statistics of\nmolecular cloud turbulence, even in the regime where the Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed is small compared to the turbulent velocities (Padoan et al.\n2007). Importantly, magnetic fields are not usually included in determinations of whether or not a molecular cloud core is \"gravitationally bound\".\nRadiation presents a complementary method for regulating\nstar formation and the need for star formation simulations to\nincorporate the effects of radiative transfer has also long been\nunderstood (e.g. Larson 1969; Black & Bodenheimer 1975;\nBoss & Myhill 1992; Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000). Radiative\nfeedback affects star formation as soon as the gas becomes\noptically thick, setting the \"opacity limit\" beyond which fragmentation can proceed no further (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976;\nRees 1976). From thereon the newborn protostar can continue\nto radiate into the surrounding gas, increasing the Jeans mass\nand thus inhibiting further star formation (Whitehouse & Bate\n2006; Krumholz 2006; Bate 2009b). In the case of massive stars,\nradiation may be sufficient to halt accretion from the cloud (Kahn\n1974; Wolfire & Cassinelli 1987) although various non-spherical\nand time-dependent effects mitigate this effect (Nakano 1989;\nNakano, Hasegawa & Norman 1995; Jijina & Adams 1996;\nYorke & Sonnhalter 2002; Krumholz, McKee & Klein 2005;\nKrumholz, Klein & McKee 2007).\nHowever, neither magnetic fields nor radiation are easy\nto incorporate into three-dimensional numerical simulations\n\nof the star formation process. The development of algorithms for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) (Price & Monaghan\n2004a,b, 2005; Price & Bate 2007) and radiative transfer in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation (Whitehouse & Bate 2004;\nWhitehouse, Bate & Monaghan 2005; Whitehouse & Bate 2006)\nin the context of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nmethod has nevertheless paved the way for such effects to be included. Thus we have recently been able to incorporate, though\nseparately, the effects of magnetic fields (Price & Bate 2008) and\nradiative feedback (Bate 2009b) into simulations of star cluster formation. In this paper we study, for the first time, the combined effects of both.\nWe thus present a 'recipe' for inefficient star formation in even\nrelatively dense molecular clouds. The ingredients (i.e., the equations of self-gravitating radiation MHD and our numerical formulation of them) are presented in Section 2. The initial conditions for\nour simulations are discussed in Section 3. We present our results\nin Section 4 and discuss their wider implications in Section 5.\n\n2 NUMERICAL METHOD\nIn this paper we solve the equations of self-gravitating radiation\nmagnetohydrodynamics, using a two-temperature flux-limited diffusion scheme for the radiation, coupled with the equations of\nideal MHD (that is, assuming infinite conductivity and without\nconsidering ambipolar (ion-neutral) diffusion or the Hall effect).\nWhilst we have previously published star cluster formation calculations using separately either the MHD (Price & Bate 2007, 2008)\nor using the flux-limited diffusion (Whitehouse & Bate 2006; Bate\n2009b) schemes, this is the first time which we have combined the\ntwo. Thus, whilst the MHD formulation is identical to that used\nin Price & Bate (2007) and Price & Bate (2008) and the radiation\nscheme is based on that used in Bate (2009b), some minor changes\nhave been made to the radiation terms in order to combine them\nwith the MHD part of the code.\n2.1 Equations of Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics\nThe equations of self-gravitating radiation MHD are solved in the\nform\nZ\n\u03c1 =\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03c1\u2032 dV \u2032 ,\n(1)\n\u00ab\n\u201e\ndv\n\u03c7\nBB\n1\n1 B2\n+ F \u2212 \u2207\u03a6,\n\u2212\n= \u2212 \u2207 P+\n(2)\ndt\n\u03c1\n2 \u03bc0\n\u03bc0\nc\n\"\n\u201e \u00ab4 #\ndu\nP\nu\n\u03c1\u03be\n,\n(3)\n= \u2212 \u2207 * v + ac\u03ba\n\u2212\ndt\n\u03c1\na\ncv\n\"\n#\n\u201e \u00ab4\nd\u03be\n\u03c1\u03be\n\u2207*F\n\u2207v : Prad\nu\n= \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 ac\u03ba\n\u2212\n, (4)\ndt\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\na\ncv\nB\nd\u03b1E\ndt\n\u22072 \u03a6\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u2207\u03b1E \u00d7 \u2207\u03b2E ,\nd\u03b2E\n0;\n= 0.\ndt\n4\u03c0G\u03c1,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density, v is the velocity, P is the hydrodynamic\npressure, B is the magnetic field, u is the specific thermal energy\nof the gas, \u03a6 is the gravitational potential, \u03be and Prad are the\nfrequency-integrated specific radiation energy and radiation pressure tensor respectively; a, c, \u03c7, \u03ba and cv are the radiation constant,\nthe speed of light, the total and absorption opacities and the ratio of\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fInefficient star formation\nspecific heats respectively and F is the radiative flux, which in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation is given by:\nF=\n\nc\u03bb\n\u2207(\u03c1\u03be),\n\u03ba\u03c1\n\ntion (F, ie. \u2207(\u03c1\u03be)) pressure gradients and from the gradient in the\ngravitational potential (\u2207\u03a6). Equations (3) and (4) are the energy\nequations for the gas and radiation respectively. Equation (5) is an\nexpression of the magnetic field in terms of the Euler (or Clebsch)\npotentials \u03b1E and \u03b2E which maintains the divergence constraint\n(\u2207 * B = 0) by construction and for which the induction equation for the magnetic field takes the particularly simple form given\nby equation (6) (Stern 1970; Rosswog & Price 2007). It should be\nnoted that use of the Euler potentials approach also introduces limitations on the topology of fields that can evolve during the calculation. Whilst these are discussed in more detail in Price & Bate\n(2008) and Price & Bate (2007), the main physical process not captured is the winding up of magnetic fields on smaller scales, since\nthe Euler potentials rely on a well defined mapping from the initial\nparticle positions to those at a later time. This means that, whilst we\nare able to study the influence of magnetic fields on the large scale\nstructure of the cloud, field growth on smaller scales is not well captured. On the other hand the ideal MHD approximation also breaks\ndown at these scales, so an improved formulation would also need\nto correctly account for non-ideal MHD effects such as resistivity\nand ambipolar diffusion. Finally, Poisson's equation (Equation 7)\nis solved in order to determine the gravitational force.\nThe equation set is closed by equations of state for the gas and\nthe radiation field. For the gas, the equation of state is given by the\nideal gas law\nP =\n\n\u03c1RT\n,\n\u03bc\n\n(9)\n\nwhere T is the gas temperature, R is the gas constant and \u03bc is the\nmean molecular weight. The equation of state takes into account\nthe translational, rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of\nmolecular hydrogen (assuming a 3:1 mix of ortho- and para- hydrogen that remains fixed throughout the calculations; see Boley et al.\n2007). It also includes the dissociation of molecular hydrogen and\nthe ionisations of hydrogen and helium (which are assumed to have\nmass fractions of X = 0.7 and Y = 0.28 respectively). The contributions of metals to the equation of state is neglected.\nFor the radiation, the equation of state is given by the Eddington approximation\nPrad = f \u03c1\u03be,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere f is the Eddington tensor which has both an isotropic term\nand an anisotropic term related to the gradient in radiation energy\ndensity (see Whitehouse & Bate 2006 for details).\nFor comparison with previous results, we have also performed\na set of calculations without radiative transfer, but which use a\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nbarotropic equation of state for the gas (i.e. replacing equations 3,\n4 and 9) of the form\nP = K\u03c1\u03b3 .\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the dimensionless flux limiter which is designed to ensure that the radiation propagates no faster than the speed of light\n(see Whitehouse et al. 2005 for details). The above expression for\nF means that the first term in equation (4) becomes a diffusion term\nfor the radiation energy (hence \"flux-limited diffusion\").\nEquation (1) is an exact solution to the continuity equation\nwhich is represented in SPH form by the density summation (see\nPrice 2008 for the difference between integral and differential formulations in an SPH context). Equation (2) is the equation of motion for the gas which contains force\nfrom the hydrodynamic\nh terms\n`\n \u0301i\n(\u2207P ), magnetohydrodynamic \u2207 \u03bc10 21 B 2 \u2212 BB and radia-\n\n3\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the polytropic exponent \u03b3 is given by\n\u03b3 = 1,\n\n\u03c1 \u2264 10\u221213 g cm\u22123 ,\n\n\u03b3 = 7/5,\n\n\u03c1 > 10\u221213 g cm\u22123 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe simulations using the barotropic equation of state are thus\nidentical to those performed by Price & Bate (2008) except for a\nfactor-of-ten decrease in the sink particle radii (see below) and also\nthe MPI-parallelisation of the tree-code, both of which change the\noverall fragmentation pattern slightly due to the chaotic nature of\nstar formation.\n2.2 Numerical method\nWe solve equations (1)\u2013(7) using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method (for reviews see Monaghan 1992; Price\n2004; Monaghan 2005). The SPH formulations of various parts of\nthese equations, as currently implemented in our code, have been\nseparately described and tested in a number of papers (mostly involving the authors), as summarised below.\n2.2.1 SPH formulation\nThe self-gravitating part of the algorithm (i.e. equation (7) and the\ngravitational force term in equation (2)) is identical to the energyconserving formulation described and tested in Price & Monaghan\n(2007). The gravitational force is softened using a softening length\nthat is equal to the SPH smoothing length and formulated such that\ntaking the Laplacian of the gravitational potential results in precisely the right hand side of Poisson's equation (7) with the density\n\u03c1 equal to that calculated in the hydrodynamics via the SPH summation (ie. the SPH expression of equation 1) (Price & Monaghan\n2007). Furthermore \u2013 despite the softening length being a variable\nfunction of position \u2013 momentum, energy and angular momentum\nare conserved exactly using this formalism. However, in practice,\na nearest-neighbour binary tree algorithm is used to efficiently calculate the long-range part of the gravitational force (and also return\nthe list of SPH neighbours), which does not conserve momentum,\nangular momentum or energy exactly. The tree code formed the\noriginal core of the SPH code and remains essentially as originally\nimplemented by Benz et al. (1990).\nAll of the evolution equations are integrated using a second\norder Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method with a timestep related to the\nconvergence of each variable with timestep (that is, determined by\ncomparing the error using half of the current timestep to that over\nthe full timestep). Given the rich array of physics in our current\ncalculations, we have found this to be substantially more accurate\nthan a standard leapfrog method where the timestep is based only\non stability considerations (rather than accuracy). Individual particle timesteps were implemented by Bate (1995) in order to efficiently follow calculations where the timestep is constrained by\nonly a small fraction of particles in a simulation.\nThe hydrodynamics and MHD parts of the code (i.e.,\nthe numerical formulation of equations (1)-(3) apart from\nthe radiation terms and equations (5)-(6)) are based on the\nsmoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics algorithm developed by\nPrice & Monaghan (2004a,b, 2005) and applied to star formation using the Euler potentials formulation by Price & Bate (2007,\n\n\f4\n\nPrice & Bate\n\n2008) (see also Rosswog & Price 2007). Special attention has been\npaid to the formulation of terms relating to the gradient of smoothing length (Price & Monaghan 2004b, 2007) which ensures that\ntotal energy and entropy are conserved exactly by the hydrodynamic parts of the equations. Energy and momentum conservation is not maintained exactly for the magnetic parts of the equations in order to avoid the well-known instability relating to exactly momentum-conserving formulations of the SPMHD force\nterm (see Price & Monaghan 2005). Furthermore, using the Euler\npotentials, the force equation is not directly derived from the numerical form of the induction equations leading to a very small\nerror in energy conservation. In practice, however, these errors are\nmuch smaller than those introduced by the treecode for the gravitational force and individual particle timesteps.\nDissipative terms corresponding to artificial viscosity and artificial resitivity are added in order to capture shocks and magnetic reconnection, respectively. These are applied as described\nin Price & Monaghan (2005) and for the Euler potentials by\nPrice & Bate (2007) and Rosswog & Price (2007). For the calculations with radiative transfer, the energy associated with this dissipation is added to the thermal energy, though obviously such energy\nis discarded for the calculations employing a barotropic equation of\nstate and thus also during the initial period (t < 1tf f ) for all the\ncalculations during which the barotropic equation of state has been\nused (see below). We are, therefore, not able to realistically assess\nthe effect of any heating that may arise due to magnetic reconnection since any heat created by reconnection in the early phases is\nlost and at later times, whilst the energy is captured, the field structure is effectively lost because of the limitations to the Euler potentials approach on smaller scales (see above). Thus, the contribution\nof magnetic dissipation to heating in the present calculations is very\nsmall.\nThe radiative transfer parts of equations (2) and (3) and\nthe radiative energy equation (4) are solved implicitly using the\nformulation developed by Whitehouse & Bate (2004), accelerated\nby Whitehouse et al. (2005) and applied to star formation by\nWhitehouse & Bate (2006) and Bate (2009b). We use the same\nopacities as Whitehouse & Bate (2006). In order to combine the\nradiative transfer parts of the code (developed by Whitehouse et al.\n2005 and based on a traditional \"number of neighbours\" approach\nto variable smoothing lengths in SPH) with the MHD (developed\nby Price & Monaghan 2004b, which is formulated taking account\nof variable smoothing length gradient terms), minor modifications\nhave been made to the manner in which the radiative transfer equations are expressed in SPH form. The main change is that the radiation diffusion term in equation (4) is calculated using an average of the kernels rather than an average smoothing length as in\nWhitehouse & Bate (2006), so that the diffusion term in the energy\nequation becomes\n\u201e\n\u00ab\nX mj c \u00bb 4Di Dj \u2013\nd\u03bei\n\u2207Wij\n(\u03c1i \u03bei \u2212 \u03c1j \u03bej )\n(13)\n=\ndt diff\n\u03c1\nD\nrij\ni \u03c1j\ni + Dj\nj\nwhere the average of the SPH kernel gradients is\n\u2207Wij =\n\n1\n[\u2207Wij (hi ) + \u2207Wij (hj )] ,\n2\n\n(14)\n\nand\nDi =\n\n\u03bbi\n.\n\u03bai \u03c1i\n\n(15)\n\nNote that in the variable smoothing length formulation of SPH, the\nsmoothing length h is an analytic function of the density \u03c1, which\n\nis in turn a function of smoothing length via the SPH density summation. A solution to the density summation must therefore be obtained iteratively as described in Price & Monaghan (2007).\n2.3 Sink particles\nSink particles were introduced into SPH by Bate, Bonnell & Price\n(1995) in order to follow star formation calculations beyond the\nformation of the first star.\nFor the calculations presented here that do not include radiative transfer, the criterion used for sink particle creation is identical\nto that described in Price & Bate (2008) and we therefore refer the\nreader to that paper for details. The major difference between the\ncalculations of Price & Bate and the similar calculations in this paper is that we have used sink particles with an accretion radius of\nonly 0.5 AU, compared to 5 AU in Price & Bate (2008) (and similarly in BBB03). This adds considerable computational expense\nto the calculations because the closest gas orbits around the sinks\n(and the smallest length scale \u223c h) are reduced by a factor of 10,\nresulting in an increase in the maximum acceleration by a factor\nof 1/r 2 = 100 and therefore\np a decrease in the minimum timestep\nin the calculations \u2206t \u221d h/|a| by a factor of \u223c30. Whilst such\nexpense is unnecessary when using a barotropic equation of state\n(in Section 4 we compare our results to previous results obtained\nby Price & Bate 2008 using 5 AU sink radii and find essentially\nno difference to the fragmentation), it is important for the radiative\ntransfer calculations.\nWith the exception of the addition of magnetic fields, the radiative transfer calculations presented here are very similar to those\nrecently published by Bate (2009b). In both, the gas is followed beyond the first hydrostatic core phase (Larson 1969) and the onset\nof molecular hydrogen dissociation (T \u2248 2000 K). Sink particles\nare inserted during the second collapse phase, just before a stellar\ncore would be formed in the calculations. Bate (2009b) inserted\nsink particles at a density of 10\u22125 g cm\u22123 while in the calculations\npresented here they are inserted slightly earlier at 10\u22126 g cm\u22123 .\nIn terms of the real star formation process, this is just a couple of\nweeks before the stellar core is formed. As in Bate (2009b), no radiative feedback is provided by the sink particle. The radiative feedback provided by the protostars is limited to the radiation emitted\nfrom the gas as it falls into the sink particles. Thus, it is important to\nmake the sink particle accretion radii as small as is computationally\npractical (0.5 AU in both the calculations of Bate 2009b and the calculations presented here). As noted by Bate (2009b), because not\nall of the protostellar luminosity is fed back into the calculations,\nthe effects of radiative feedback seen in the calculations presented\nhere must be viewed as a lower limit.\nAn estimate of the energy input that we are missing from accretion within the sink particle radius can be made by comparing\nthe accretion luminosity from within this region to that available\nfrom infinity. The accretion energy expected from within our sink\nparticle radius of 0.5 AU is given by\n\u201e\n\u00ab\n1\n1\nLacc = GM \u1e40\n\u2212\n.\n(16)\nR\u2217\n0.5AU\nThis may be compared to the accretion luminosity that is captured\nin our calculations by accretion to the sink radius from infinity,\nwhich is given by Lacc = GM \u1e40 /(0.5 AU). Therefore, if we assume a protostellar radius of \u223c 3Rsun there is potentially a factor\nof up to \u223c 30 in further energy input that is missing from the current calculations. Bate (2009b) investigated the effect of this missing radiation on his similar calculations that did not include magc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fInefficient star formation\nnetic fields by repeating a calculation with a larger accretion radius\nof 5 AU (i.e. reducing the accretion luminosity by a further order\nof magnitude). He found only a small difference in the amount of\nfragmentation that occurred between the 0.5 AU and 5 AU calculations because even the heating present in the calculation with 5-AU\naccretion radii was enough to inhibit fragmentation near to existing\nprotostars. Thus, while we again emphasize that the radiative feedback incorporated into the current calculations is only a lower limit,\nwe believe that using accretion radii of 0.5 AU captures the essence\nof the effects of radiative feedback, at least in terms of fragmentation. This is in stark contrast to the situation encountered using a\nbarotropic equation of state.\n\n3 INITIAL CONDITIONS\nThe initial conditions for the simulations are identical to those presented by Price & Bate (2008) and similar to the original calculation of Bate et al. (2003) and the first of the calculations performed\nby Bate (2009b). We briefly recap the initial conditions below.\n\n3.1 Density, temperature and velocity field\nWe set up an initially uniform, spherical cloud with a diameter of\n0.375 pc (77,400 AU) that contains a total of 50 M\u2299 of molecular\n\u22123\ngas, giving an initial density of \u03c10 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221219\np g cm (nH2 =\n4\n3 \u00d7 10 ) and a global free-fall time of tff = 3\u03c0/(32\u03c10 G) =\n1.90 \u00d7 105 yrs.\nThe cloud is constructed using 3.5 million SPH particles (determined by the resolution requirement for resolving the Jeans mass\nby Bate & Burkert 1997, see Bate et al. 2003) placed in a uniform\nrandom distribution cropped to the cloud radius (i.e. no particles\nare placed exterior to the cloud). This results in a significant expansion of the outer layers as the calculation proceeds (equivalent to\nthe assumption of open boundary conditions in a grid-based simulation). The initial sound speed was set to 1.84 \u00d7 104 cm s\u22121 ,\ncorresponding to a temperature of 10 K given the mean molecular\nweight of \u03bc = 4.0/(2 \u00d7 0.7 + 0.28) = 2.38 amu. The resultant\nratio of thermal to gravitational energy was \u03b1grav = 0.074.\nA supersonic 'turbulent' velocity field with power spectrum\nP (k) \u221d k\u22124 (i.e. consistent with Larson's scaling relations, Larson\n1981) was imposed upon the initially uniform density cloud as in\nBate et al. (2003), with the initial velocity field normalised such\nthat the kinetic energy is initially equal to the gravitational potential\nenergy of the cloud. This gives an initial root mean square (RMS)\nMach number of 6.4 and an initial RMS velocity of 1.17 \u00d7 105\ncm/s.\nThe computational challenge of star formation is well illustrated by the fact that during the calculations, we find that the densest regions can contain particles moving on a timestep up to 219\ntimes smaller than the largest timestep bin (which is constrained\nby the time between output dumps), so that the shortest timestep\nis around 1.5 hours compared to a total evolution time of several\nhundred thousand years.\n\n3.2 Magnetic fields\nWe quantify the relative strength of the magnetic field in terms of\nthe mass-to-flux ratio (M/\u03a6) of the cloud, compared to the critical\nvalue for the onset of collapse in a spherical cloud given by (e.g.\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n5\n\nMouschovias & Spitzer 1976; Mestel 1999; Mac Low & Klessen\n2004)\nr\n\u201e \u00ab\nM\n2c1\n5\n,\n(17)\n=\n\u03a6 crit\n3\n\u03c0G\u03bc0\nwhere G and \u03bc0 are the gravitational constant and the permeability\nof free space respectively and c1 is a constant determined numerically by Mouschovias & Spitzer (1976) to be c1 \u2248 0.53.\nIn this paper, we have performed calculations starting with an\ninitially uniform magnetic field with mass-to-flux ratios in units\nof the critical value of M/\u03a6 = \u221e (i.e. no magnetic field), 10, 5\nand 3. All of our calculations are 'supercritical' (that is, unstable to\ncollapse) as under our assumption of ideal MHD (i.e. no ambipolar\ndiffusion or resistivity), subcritical clouds would not (and do not)\ncollapse.\nThe corresponding physical field strength for a given mass-toflux ratio and cloud dimensions is\n\u201e \u00ab\u22121 \u201e\n\u00ab\u201e\n\u00ab\u22122\nM\nR\nM\nB0 = 194 \u03bcG\n, (18)\n\u03a6\n50 M\u2299\n0.188 pc\nwhere M/\u03a6 is the mass to flux ratio in units of the critical value.\nThus, a simulation with a critical mass-to-flux ratio would have\nB0 = 194\u03bcG and for the calculations with mass-to-flux ratios of\n\u221e, 10, 5 and 3 the corresponding field strengths are given by B0 =\n0, 19, 39 and 65\u03bcG, respectively.\nThe magnetic field may also be parametrised in terms of the\nplasma \u03b2, the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure, according to\n\u201e \u00ab2 \"\n\u00ab\n\"2 \u201e M \u00ab\u22121 \u201e\nM\nR\ncs\n\u03b2 = 0.028\n.\n\u03a6\n184 m s\u22121\n50 M\u2299\n0.188 pc\n(19)\nThe simulations presented here thus have initial \u03b2's of \u221e, 2.8, 0.7\nand 0.25 respectively. Note that the magnetic pressure is dominant\nover gas pressure in the cloud for mass-to-flux ratios < 6 which\nis the case for the two strongest-field calculations. Indeed, as in\nPrice & Bate (2008), we find that these two calculations show far\nmore significant differences compared to the weaker field and hydrodynamic calculations.\nFinally, the Alfv\u00e9n speed in the initial cloud can be computed\nusing\n\u201e \u00ab\u22121\u201e\n\u00ab 1\u201e\n\u00ab\u2212 1\n2\n2\nM\nR\nM\nvA = 1.6 \u00d7 105 cm s\u22121\n,\n\u03a6\n50 M\u2299\n0.188 pc\n(20)\ngiving vA = 0, 1.6 \u00d7 104 , 3.1 \u00d7 104 and 5.2 \u00d7 104 cm s\u22121 for the\ncalculations in this paper. Thus, the initial turbulent motions in the\ncloud are super-Alfv\u00e9nic in all cases with Alfv\u00e9nic Mach numbers\nof \u221e, 7.3, 3.8 and 2.3, respectively.\n\n4 RESULTS\nWe have computed a total of eight calculations, that is, for four\ndifferent mass-to-flux ratios, both with and without radiative transfer (where \"without\" means that we use the barotropic equation of\nstate given by equation (12) instead).\nThe evolution of the simulations can be divided into two\nstages: i) the initial collapse of the cloud (i.e. up to \u2248 1 free-fall\ntime) during which the cloud is optically thin, essentially isothermal, and the dynamics and large scale structure are primarily controlled by the interaction of turbulence and magnetic fields; ii) the\nsubsequent evolution of the cloud after the formation of the first\nstar (i.e. & 1 free-fall time), where the cloud has optically thick\n\n\f6\n\nPrice & Bate\n\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fInefficient star formation\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. A comparison of the fragmentation that has occurred in the eight different calculations at 1.2 free fall times (tff ). The two left-hand columns show\ncolumn density for each calculation, with magnetic field strength increasing from top to bottom (as indicated by the mass-to-flux ratio in units of the critical\nvalue for collapse, where M/\u03a6 = \u221e corresponds to hydrodynamics) using either a barotropic equation of state (first column) or with radiative transfer\n(second column), as indicated. A strong decrease in protostar formation with increasing magnetic field strengthR may be observed\n(comparing rows from top to\nR\nbottom). The radiative feedback from the protostars is illustrated by plots of the mass-weighted temperature ( \u03c1T dz/ \u03c1 dz), shown in the corresponding\nright-hand panels. The effect of the radiation heating the gas in the vicinity of the protostars (fourth column) can be seen to be poorly captured by the barotropic\nequation of state approximation (third column) and leads to a dramatic suppression of small-scale fragmentation (comparing the first and second columns).\n\nregions embedded in the wider (optically thin) large scale structure, and where the small-scale fragmentation is regulated by the\nradiative feedback from existing protostars on the gas.\n\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n4.1 Large-scale cloud structure\nDuring the first phase, the radiative transfer has little effect on the\noverall dynamics compared to the use of a barotropic equation of\nstate because the cloud is optically thin, radiation can escape eas-\n\n\f8\n\nPrice & Bate\n\nily and there are no significant sources of radiation. Typical temperature variations are of the order \u2206T /T \u223c 10%. However, it\nis computationally very expensive to compute the evolution of the\ncloud with radiative transfer in the optically thin regime. We have\ntherefore computed only one set of calculations of the global cloud\nstructure during the first (isothermal) phase, the results of which are\nshown at one free-fall time in Figure 1 (with magnetic field strength\nincreasing from left to right, as indicated). These are essentially the\nsame as those presented by Price & Bate (2008) are we therefore\ndiscuss them only briefly here.\nFigure 1, as in Price & Bate (2008) reveals the dramatic influence the global magnetic field has on the large scale structure of\nthe cloud, even though the field is much too weak to prevent global\ngravitational collapse. In particular, for the two strong magnetic\nfield calculations (mass-to-flux ratios of 5 and 3 shown in the two\nright hand panels) large-scale voids are visible in the cloud where\nmaterial has slipped down the field lines to leave behind evacuated but magnetically-pressurised voids. These magnetic-pressure\nsupported voids were discussed in detail in Price & Bate (2008)\n(see also Price et al. 2008) and appear in the regime where \u03b2 < 1\n(i.e. where the magnetic pressure is dominant over the gas pressure). This regime is particularly interesting given that almost all\nmagnetic field strength measurements in molecular clouds indicate\nthat \u03b2 < 1 (Crutcher 1999; Bourke et al. 2001; Heiles & Troland\n2004; Heiles & Crutcher 2005). Also visible during the initial expansion phase is a 'stripy' structure in the column density maps\nwhich is aligned with the large scale magnetic field lines. This is\na consequence of the anisotropy of turbulent motions in the presence of a magnetic field (e.g. Goldreich & Sridhar 1995) and, while\nnot so obvious in Figure 1, was discussed and clearly illustrated by\nPrice & Bate (2008).\n4.2 Fragmentation\nFrom one free-fall time (tff ), the cloud structures shown in Figure 1\nwere evolved both with and without radiative transfer (i.e. using\nthe barotropic equation of state in the former case and the full fluxlimited diffusion equations in the latter). The simulations were run\nfrom this point to between 1.25 and 1.54 tff (2.93 \u00d7 105 yrs) depending on the computational expense (the calculations slow down\nsignificantly once star formation initiates and the more protostars\nare formed, the slower the calculations become). The barotropic\ncalculations with mass-to-flux ratios of M/\u03a6 = \u221e, 10, 5 and 3\nbegin forming stars at t \u2248 1.07, 1.03, 1.10 and 1.19tff , respectively, with the star formation in the radiative transfer conterparts\ntypically being delayed by \u2248 0.01 tff . A close-up of the fragmentation in all eight simulations is shown in Figure 2, showing column\ndensity (left-hand panels) and mass-weighted temperature (righthand panels) at 1.20 tff , after star formation has begun in all eight\nclouds. The sink particles are shown as white filled circles.\nThe left-hand (column density) panels of Figure 2 dramatically illustrates two main effects. The first is an overall decrease\nin star formation rate with increasing magnetic field strength (rows\nfrom top to bottom are in order of weakest to strongest magnetic\nfield). This is a result of the influence of the global magnetic field\non the large scale cloud structure, as already evident in Figure 1.\nIn particular, for the stronger field calculations (bottom two rows\nof Figure 2, and the rightmost two panels of Figure 1), large parts\nof the cloud are supported against collapse by the magnetic field\nresulting in fewer collapsing sub-regions (or 'cores'). For example,\nwhere the hydrodynamic calculation (top row of Figure 2) has collections of protostars separated by a couple of thousand AU, only\n\none collapsing region is evident in the strongest field (M/\u03a6 = 3)\ncase (bottom row), which shows no sub-fragmentation either with\nor without radiative transfer. The effect of the magnetic field in\nslowing the infall from the global cloud is further quantified in Figure 3 and discussed in Section 4.3, below.\nThe second effect visible in Figure 2 is the dramatic suppression of small-scale fragmentation by the radiative feedback. This\nis especially obvious in the hydrodynamic/weak field calculations\nwhere the calculations using a barotropic equation of state have\nfragmented into multiple low-mass objects which interact violently,\ncausing ejections of very low mass objects from multiple systems.\nThis small-scale fragmentation occurs primarily in the massive protostellar discs. By contrast, in the calculations which include radiative transfer, all of the subsequent disc fragmentation is suppressed\nby the radiation from the existing protostar(s). A good example is\nfound in the lower-right of the M/\u03a6 = 10 panels of Figure 2: with\nradiative feedback a single object with a disc is formed, while without radiative feedback this disc fragments into three objects, one\nof which is ejected. The radiative feedback, in effect sets a minimum distance between protostars by substantially increasing the\ntemperature and therefore the Jeans length in the gas immediately\nsurrounding a protostar (Bate 2009b).\nThe differences between computing the radiative transfer and\nusing the barotropic equation of state approximation are best illustrated by plotting the temperature, given in the right-hand panels\nRof Figure 2.R Each panel shows the integrated temperature map (i.e.\n\u03c1T dz/ \u03c1 dz) for the corresponding column-density panel in\nFigure 2. We have not plotted the sink particles on these panels so\nthat the temperature distribution very close to the protostars can\nbe seen for the barotropic calculations. For the barotropic equation of state (centre-right panels), the temperature is simply related\nto the density, leading to very point-like sources of energy concentrated around the protostars themselves. In the radiative transfer calculations (right-most panels), the radiation emitted from the\nhigh-density optically-thick gas near the protostars heats a much\nlarger surrounding region to temperatures > 30 K, effectively shutting off any further fragmentation in this material (as evident in the\nleft-hand column-density panels of Figure 2).\n\n4.3 Star formation rate\nThe effects of both magnetic fields and the radiative feedback on\nthe star formation rate are quantified in Figure 3, which shows the\ntotal mass in protostars (that is, the total mass of all sink particles in a simulation) as a function of time. After t = 1.2 tff ,\nthe eight simulations form a strict sequence of progressively decreasing star formation rate in the order: hydrodynamic, barotropic;\nhydrodynamic, RT; M/\u03a6 = 10, barotropic, M/\u03a6 = 10, RT;\nM/\u03a6 = 5, barotropic, M/\u03a6 = 5, RT; M/\u03a6 = 3, barotropic,\nM/\u03a6 = 3, RT, i.e. with magnetic fields as the primary effect and\nradiative feedback secondary. The rate at which gas is converted\ninto stars decreases due to the influence of both magnetic fields\nand radiative feedback, though more strongly with the former. For\nexample, at t = 1.2 tff , the hydrodynamic calculation contains\n2.2 M\u2299 in stars using a barotropic equation of state, compared to\n1.3 M\u2299 with radiative feedback, both of which are higher than the\n[0.83 M\u2299 , 0.44 M\u2299 ] formed by the weak field M/\u03a6 = 10 calculation at the same time [without,with] radiative transfer. These numbers decrease further to [0.42 M\u2299 , 0.33 M\u2299 ] for the M/\u03a6 = 5\nsimulation and further still to [0.055 M\u2299 , 0.0056 M\u2299 ] for the\nstrongest magnetic field case (M/\u03a6 = 3). This general trend is\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fInefficient star formation\n\n9\n\nFigure 3. Total mass in stars (sink particles) as a function of time, showing all eight calculations with (thick lines) and without (thin lines) radiative transfer at four different magnetic field strengths: hydrodynamic (solid\nblack lines), M/\u03a6 = 10 (dotted red lines), M/\u03a6 = 5 (dashed blue lines),\nand M/\u03a6 = 3 (dot-dashed magenta lines). The star formation rate decreases with increasing magnetic field strength and with the addition of radiative feedback. Note how the two curves for each magnetic field strength\ntrack each other for some time before diverging, indicating that radiative\nfeedback only plays a role in suppressing subsequent fragmentation rather\nthan changing the initial pattern of star formation.\n\ncontinued as far as we have been able to run the calculations in\neach case (Figure 3).\nThe fact that the radiative feedback influences subsequent star\nformation rather than the initial fragmentation is also evident from\nFigure 3. In particular, the two curves corresponding to the same\nmagnetic field strength but with and without radiative transfer in\neach case track each other closely after first sink formation, before\ndiverging at later times. Taking the M/\u03a6 = 3 case as an example\n(i.e. the lower two curves in Figure 3), and comparing the time evolution in Figure 3 to the fragmentation sequence shown in Figure 5,\nit may be observed that the two curves diverge when secondary disc\nfragmentation occurs in the barotropic calculation (t \u2248 1.27 tff ),\nleading to a burst of star formation (and subsequent ejection of lowmass objects from the multiple system). In the radiative transfer\ncase, the disc does not fragment but instead continues to slowly\naccrete onto the existing protostar.\nMagnetic fields and radiation are also found to affect different densities in the cloud. Figure 4 shows the mass above a\ngiven density threshold in the cloud as a function of time for\nthree different density thresholds, \u03c1 > 10\u221217 g cm\u22123 (bottom\npanel), \u03c1 > 10\u221214 g cm\u22123 (middle panel), and \u03c1 > 10\u221211 g cm\u22123\n(top panel), where solid lines correspond to calculations using a\nbarotropic EOS and dashed lines refer to calculations using radiative transfer and, as in Figure 3, the lines form a sequence from\ntop to bottom with increasing magnetic field strength. At a density threshold of 10\u221217 g cm\u22123 (bottom panel), whilst there is a\nstrong decrease in the mass collapsing to higher densities with increasing magnetic field strength, there is almost no difference between the barotropic simulations and those with full radiative transfer (i.e. comparing the solid and dashed lines), indicating that radiative feedback plays very little role at these densities. At a threshold\nof \u03c1 > 10\u221214 g cm\u22123 (middle panel) the results are similar (alc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nFigure 4. The total mass above certain density thresholds in each collapsing cloud as a function of time. From top to bottom the panels show\nM (\u03c1 > 10\u221217 g cm\u22123 ) (approximately two orders of magnitude denser\nthan the original cloud density), M (\u03c1 > 10\u221214 g cm\u22123 ), and M (\u03c1 >\n10\u221211 g cm\u22123 ) (i.e. above which most material is in protostars). The different lines are as in Figure 3. Thick lines denote those calculations with radiative feedback, while thin lines are using the barotropic equation of state.\nThe line types and colours denote the magnetic field strength (also ordered\nfrom top to bottom in each panel with progressively increasing magnetic\nfield strength). Magnetic fields can be seen to affect the collapse rate at all\ndensity thresholds (all panels), while radiative feedback primarily prevents\nfragmentation in the highest density regions of the cloud (top panel, comparing thin and thick lines).\n\nthough the overall masses are lower) apart from some divergence at\nt & 1.4tff in the M/\u03a6 = 3 calculation. By contrast, at higher densities (\u03c1 > 10\u221211 g cm\u22123 , top panel), where the gas is opticallythick to radiation, there are differences of up to \u223c 50% in the mass\nabove this density between the barotropic and radiative transfer calculations (the latter having systematically lower mass accumulation\nrates) similar to the differences observed in Figure 3.\n\n4.4 Dynamics\nThe effect of the reduced fragmentation on the dynamics of the\nprotostars due to the radiative feedback is illustrated in Figure 5,\nshowing a time sequence of the evolution in the strongest magnetic\n\n\f10\n\nPrice & Bate\n\nFigure 5. Time sequence of fragmentation in the strongest magnetic field calculation (M/\u03a6 = 3), shown from the comparison time of t = 1.2 tff in Figure 2\n(top row, where the panels here are shifted in position relative to Figure 2 to follow the subsequent fragmentation) up to t = 1.45ff (bottom row) at intervals\nof 0.05tff . The two left-hand columns show column density for the calculation using a barotropic equation of state (first column) and with radiative transfer\n(second column). Corresponding mass-weighted temperatures for the two calculations are shown in the two right-hand columns, highlighting the heating of\nthe gas due to the radiative feedback in the regions immediately surrounding the protostars. Although the radiative feedback suppresses fragmentation on the\nsmallest scales, dynamical interactions nevertheless occur over larger length scales, as evident from the merger of the two star-forming cores which occurs at\nt = 1.4tff in each of the calculations.\n\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fInefficient star formation\nfield case (M/\u03a6 = 3) in intervals of 0.05 tff (9,500 yrs) from the\nonset of star formation. As in Figure 2, the two left-hand columns\nshow column densities for the barotropic (first column) and radiative transfer (second column) simulations, whilst the corresponding\nright-hand panels show the mass-weighted temperature. The overall picture is similar to that apparent from Figure 2, except that the\ntime sequence shows that despite the fact that the M/\u03a6 = 3 simulations each only produced a single object at t = 1.2 tff collapse\nand fragmentation continues to form binary and multiple systems\nat later times (i.e. t & 1.3 tf f ). However, whilst the larger scale dynamics is similar between the barotropic and RT calculations (e.g.\nthe merger of the two main collapsed regions at t \u2248 1.4 tff ), the\nsmaller scale disc fragmentation which results in a triple ejection\nat t = 1.3tf f in the barotropic calculation is completely absent\nfrom the radiative transfer simulation, as a result of the higher temperatures surrounding the first protostars to form (fourth column of\nFigure 5).\nThe combined effects of stronger magnetic fields and radiative\nfeedback are, therefore, to decrease the star formation rate (Figure\n3) and decrease the number of occurrences of dynamical interactions and ejections between protostars.\n4.5 Protostellar masses\nThe calculations presented here are of 50 M\u2299 clouds that collapse\nto form 3\u201323 protostars. With such small numbers of objects, and\nthe fact that the simulations have not all been followed for the same\namount of time, it does not make sense to attempt to plot stellar\nmass functions. Rather, in Table 1, we give the amount of mass that\nhas been converted into protostars (sink particles), the number of\nprotostars, and the mean and median masses of the protostars. We\ngive these values at t = 1.25 tff for all but one of the calculations,\nand at the end of each calculation.\nGenerally, as found by Bate (2009b), the effect of radiative feedback is to dramatically decrease the number of protostars formed compared with the barotropic equation of state (Table\n1, columns 3 and 8). Simultaneously, the protostars are generally\nfound to be more massive with radiative feedback because gas that\nwould have formed other objects via the fragmentation of discs and\nnearby filaments using a barotropic equation of state is hotter and\nis able to be accreted by existing protostars instead (Table 1, column 5 for M/\u03a6 = 5, 10 and column 8 for M/\u03a6 = \u221e). In the\nstrongest magnetic field case, these statements are still true, but the\ntrends only become apparent fairly late in the calculations because\nof the delay of the star formation caused by the strong field (Table\n1, column 8 for M/\u03a6 = 3).\nWhen investigating the effect of the magnetic field things become more interesting. As already discussed, the rate at which gas\nis converted into stars decreases strongly with increasing magnetic\nfield strength for both the barotropic and radiative transfer calculations (Table 1, column 4). However, where this mass goes differs\nsignificantly between the barotropic and radiative transfer calculations. For the barotropic calculations, the rate of protostar formation decreases strongly with increasing magnetic field strength, but\nthe typical masses of objects are independent of the magnetic field\nstrength (Table 1, columns 5, 6, 10, and 11). We also note that if the\ncalculations are followed for a long periods of time all of the calculations eventually produce large numbers of objects regardless\nof the field strength (Table 1, column 8). However, with radiative\nfeedback there is no significant dependence of the rate of protostar\nformation on the magnetic field strength (Table 1, columns 3 and\n8), and there is an indication that the mean masses of the protoc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n11\n\nstars may increase with decreasing magnetic field strength (Table\n1, columns 5 and 10). This latter effect is presumably because more\nof the gas is supported with a stronger magnetic field and not able to\nbe accreted by the protostars. Although this needs to be confirmed\nwith larger calculations that form larger numbers of objects, this\nimplies that the characteristic stellar mass may decrease with increasing magnetic field strength, a result that is somewhat counterintuitive since a naive calculation of a magnetic Jeans mass would\nlead one to conclude that the characteristic stellar mass should increase with increasing magnetic field strength.\n\n5 DISCUSSION\nIn this paper we have studied, for the first time, the combined effects of magnetic fields and radiative feedback on the formation of\nstellar clusters from turbulent molecular clouds. We find that the\ntwo effects are complementary in the sense that they affect the star\nformation process at very different scales. Magnetic fields affect\nthe large-scale cloud structure (Figure 1), influencing all densities\nin the cloud (Figure 4). Stronger fields decrease the overall star\nformation rate (Figure 3). By contrast, radiative feedback affects\nsmall-scale fragmentation (Figure 2) and influences only the highest densities in the cloud (Figure 4). It influences the star formation\nrate primarily by inhibiting small-scale fragmentation in cores once\nthe first protostar has been formed (Figures 2, 3 and 5). However,\nmultiple systems are still common, formed from well-separated but\nmutually bound condensations (Figure 5).\nThe primary effect of the magnetic field is to lower the accretion rate onto the star-forming cores by providing large-scale support to low-density regions of the cloud, thus preventing this material from subsequently being accreted. There is no clear shift in\nthe onset of star formation with magnetic field strength (Figure 3),\nexcept perhaps in the strongest magnetic calculation where star formation (ie. sink particle creation) does not initiate until t \u2248 1.20tff\n(Figures 5 and 3) compared to t \u2248 1.03 \u2212 1.11tff in the moderate/weak/zero field simulations. Since the simulations do not produce large numbers of protostars and they are not followed very\nfar any conclusions regarding the masses of the protostars must\nbe treated with caution. However, we find that using a barotropic\nequation of state the typical masses of the protostars do not depend\nsignificantly on the magnetic field strength but the number of protostars formed increases with weaker fields (Table 1). Conversely,\nwith radiative feedback, the numbers of protostars formed in the\nclouds does not vary greatly with the magnetic field strength but\nthe masses of the protostars tend to be lower with stronger magnetic\nfields. Generally, radiative feedback results in a larger characteristic\nprotostellar mass than using the barotropic approximation.\nThe general effect of radiation on the fragmentation is easily understood in terms of the increase in the Jeans length of the\nheated gas surrounding existing protostars. An increase in temperature (e.g. from 10K to & 30K as in Figure 2) leads to an increase\nin the Jeans length since \u03bbJ \u221d T 1/2 . Because radiative feedback\nacts mainly on small scales, it takes longer for this to affect the\noverall star formation rate substantially (e.g. note the reduction in\nthe figures of M (> \u03c1) propagating slowly to higher densities in\nthe M/\u03a6 = 3 run in Figure 4 due to the progressive heating of\nwider regions of the cloud visible in Figure 5). However, it has a\ndramatic influence on the initial mass function (IMF) by suppressing fragmentation in discs (and nearby filaments) and decreasing\nthe likelihood of forming multiple systems from which low-mass\nmembers can be ejected (e.g. Figure 5).

The statistical properties of the protostars formed in the eight calculations. For each of the four mass-to-flux ratios, barotropic and radiative transfer\ncalculations were performed. Due to computational expense, the calculations were followed for a different amounts of time. All but one calculation was\nevolved until 1.25 tff , so we give the statistical properties of the simulations at this time. We also give the statistical properties at the end of each calculation.\nIn each case, we give the number of protostars (sink particles) formed, the total mass in protostars, and the mean and median masses of the protostars. It is\nclear that using a barotropic equation of state produces many more objects than are obtained with radiative transfer. It is also clear that the rate of protostar\nproduction decreases strongly with magnetic field strength in the barotropic calculations (column 3), although the typical mass of the protostars is independent\nof field strength. Conversely, with radiative transfer there is no significant dependence of the rate of protostar production with magnetic field strength, and\nthere is an indication that the mean masses of the protostars may decrease with decreasing field strength (columns 5 and 10).\n\ntive feedback is also more pronounced when the potential well in\nwhich the protostars form is deeper, partially offsetting the inherent\ndecrease of the Jeans mass with increasing density, which in turn\nleads to a reduced dependence of the IMF on the initial density of\nthe cloud which, as discussed in detail by Bate (2009b), may explain why the IMF appears to be so universal across very different\nstar-forming environments.\n5.1 Comparison with observations\nWith a cloud of only 50 solar masses it is difficult to make a\nstatistically meaningful comparison with observed star-forming\nmolecular clouds as a whole since nearby clouds typically contain\n103 \u2212105 M\u2299 of material over areas as large as 74 pc2 (Evans et al.\n2009). Rather our simulated clouds fall within the definition of a\n'millimeter core', ie. nH2 & 2 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 , and sizes similar to\nthe typically measured core sizes of 1.5 \u00d7 104 AU in Ophiuchus\nand 3 \u00d7 104 AU in Perseus and Serpens (Enoch et al. 2007). As\npointed out by Bate et al. (2003), the dense cores formed in simulations of the size presented here are similar to the Ophiuchus-F\ncore which measures \u2248 0.1 pc across and has a mass of \u2248 8 M\u2299\n(Motte, Andre & Neri 1998). In Figure 6 we show simulated extinction maps of the four runs with radiative feedback, at the simulation resolution (left) and at the resolution of the Evans et al.\n(2009) extinction maps for Ophiuchus (right), with extinction on\na linear greyscale map from AV = 1 to AV = 25 which may\nbe directly compared to the Evans et al. (2009) maps. To produce\nthe extinction maps we have simply used the inverse of the conversion from extinction to hydrogen column density of 1.37 \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 mag\u22121 adopted by Evans et al. (2009). The resolution\nof the right hand panels is calculated from the c2d extinction map\nresolution of 270\u2032\u2032 , which at the assumed distance of 125pc for\nOphiuchus gives a resolution of 0.16 pc. We have simulated this\nresolution in our maps by enforcing a minimum smoothing length\nof 0.08pc on the SPH particles when calculating the column density (i.e., approximating the point spread function for the extinction\nmaps by the SPH kernel smoothing function).\nStar formation efficiencies are calculated by Evans et al.\n(2009) by dividing the mass in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs, defined as objects with infrared excesses assumed to correspond to\n\nthe presence of a disc) by the total mass of the cloud plus YSOs.\nThat is,\nSF E =\n\nM\u2217\n,\nM\u2217 + M (cloud)\n\n(21)\n\nwhere M (cloud) is derived by integrating the extinction maps,\nconverted to column density, over area. Despite the low resolution of the observations compared to our simulated cloud, the cloud\nmasses measured from the clouds on the right hand side of Figure 6,\nby integrating column density over the area within the AV = 2\ncontour, are remarkably accurate. For example, the measured mass\nfor the zero magnetic fields case (M/\u03a6 = \u221e) at the observational resolution is 44.1 M\u2299 , which may be compared with the total\ncloud mass in our simulations of 50 M\u2299 , of which \u223c 44 M\u2299 lies\nwithin the sphere with the approximate radius of the AV = 2 contour. The caveat to this for the observations is that the conversion\nfrom extinction to column density relies on a model for the dust,\nchanges to which can have a significant impact on cloud masses\n(e.g. Evans et al. 2009 discuss the fact that their cloud masses are\nrevised down by a factor of 1.4 from previous estimates due to revision of the dust model).\nEfficiencies thus derived by Evans et al. (2009) range from\n3 \u2212 6%, which is assumed to represent an average over the last\n2 Myr given that this is the estimated lifetime of YSOs with infrared\nexcesses. The comparison between observations and our simulations is made more difficult by the fact that we are not able to\nfollow the cloud collapse for longer than around 1.5tff with current computational resources1 . Nevertheless, one can make tentative estimates based on the star formation rates we find in Figure 3\nand the masses in Table 1. For the four clouds shown on the right\nhand side of Figure 6 (the four runs with radiative feedback included), cloud masses measured by integrating the column density\nwithin the AV = 2 contour are 44.1, 44.0, 43.6 and 43.9 for the\nM/\u03a6 = \u221e, 10, 5 and 3 clouds respectively. A straightforward\napplication of (21) at the end point of each of our calculations indicates that of order 3 \u2212 5% of the gas has been converted into stars\n1 The key limitation being that for only a few collapsed objects, good load\nbalancing is very difficult to achieve, limiting the usefulness of simply running on a higher number of processors.\n\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\n\fInefficient star formation\n\n13\n\nFigure 6. Extinction maps of the four calculations with radiative transfer and varying initial magnetic field strength (M/\u03a6 as indicated) at the simulation\nresolution (left) and at the resolution of the Evans et al. (2009) extinction maps for Ophiuchus (right). The AV = 2 contour is shown, the mass inside of which\nwas used to calculate the mass in the c2d survey. We have converted hydrogen column density to AV using the inverse of the conversion factor adopted for the\nc2d observations by Evans et al. (2009), i.e. a conversion from extinction to hydrogen column density of 1.37 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 mag\u22121 . The scale from AV = 1\nto AV = 25 is the same as that used for the c2d maps.\n\nover the time for which the simulations have been run. Whilst these\nvalues are in agreement with the observational results (though not\nfor dense gas), they are not very meaningful given that they represent evolution over fractions of a freefall time beyond initial star\nformation (the end time for each of the calculations is given in Table 1 and can be inferred from Figure 3) and will increase with time\nas more mass is converted into stars.\nMore useful are estimates which take into account the\ntimescale over which star formation has proceeded. The depletion\ntime for the cloud is given by\ntdep = M (cloud)/\u1e40\u2217 .\n\n(22)\n\nCalculating the average star formation rate from the onset of star\nformation using Figure 3 and assuming that these rates will continue indefinitely (a dubious assumption), we obtain depletion\ntimes of 0.8, 1.6, 1.3 and 1.8 Myr for the clouds in the above\nfour calculations respectively. Whilst these are very short compared to the global depletion times for the clouds in Evans et al.\n(2009) of 30 to 66 Myr, they are in agreement with the depletion\ntimescale derived for dense cores within such clouds (i.e., gas with\nn & 2 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 , which our initial cloud density lies above)\nwhich are in the range of 0.6-2.9 Myr with an average of 1.8Myr.\nFinally, Evans et al. (2009) quantify the observed inefficiency\nin terms of the star formation rate per free-fall time, defined as\n(Krumholz & Tan 2007)\nSF Rff = \u1e40\u2217 tff /Mcloud ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere tff is defined as the free-fall time for the mean density of the\ncloud and which here we take as the initial free-fall time for our\ninitially uniform density clouds.\nUsing this measure we find star formation rates of SF Rff =\n0.23, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.10 for the four runs (M/\u03a6 = \u221e, 10, 5 and\n3 respectively) that include radiative feedback and SF Rff = 0.32,\n0.18, 0.17 and 0.12 for the four runs using a barotropic equation of\nstate, that is, neglecting radiative feedback. Thus, only the strong\nc 2009 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201315\n\nmagnetic field calculations (\u03b2 < 1, corresponding to M/\u03a6 . 7)\nthat include radiative feedback approach the observed range of\nSF Rff = 0.03 \u2212 0.06 measured by Evans et al. (2009). All of the\ncalculations with weaker field strengths and/or neglecting radiative\nfeedback have star formation rates that are much higher than observations suggest. From the point of view of matching theory to\nobservation, this is reassuring, since, as discussed in Price & Bate\n(2008), the most realistic of our calculations in terms of magnetic\nfield strength is the strongest field case, M/\u03a6 = 3, since molecular cloud cores are typically observed with mass-to-flux ratios that\nare marginally supercritical (i.e. M/\u03a6 \u223c 2 \u2212 3) and with magnetic\npressure smaller than gas pressure by a factor of \u223c 3 (i.e., \u03b2 \u223c 0.3)\n(Crutcher 1999; Heiles & Troland 2004). However we caution that\nany conclusions regarding the star formation efficiency from these\ncalculations are necessarily limited by the relatively short period\nover which we have been able to follow the calculations beyond\nthe free-fall time.\nFurthermore our results present only a lower limit on the effect\nof feedback since we have neglected feedback from within 0.5 AU\nof a star including the driving of stellar winds and collimated outflows which may act to further reduce the star formation efficiency\n(Matzner & McKee 2000), perhaps explaining the remaining discrepancy between the efficiencies we find and the observed range\nof 3 \u2212 6%.\n\n5.2 Implications for theory\nThe reduction in star formation rate is primarily a result of the support provided to the cloud by the magnetic field. The global magnetic field, whilst not sufficient to prevent collapse altogether, is\nnevertheless able to affect the binding energy.\nClark et al. (2008) point out that the star formation rate can\nbe made arbitrarily low in globally unbound clouds by increasing\nthe ratio of kinetic to gravitational potential energy Ekin /|Egrav |\n\n\f14\n\nPrice & Bate\n\n(set to unity in the initial conditions for the calculations we present\nhere). The fact that increasing the turbulent velocity dispersion\ncan decrease the efficiency of star formation in the sense of lowering the star formation rate has also been discussed previously\n(e.g. Padoan 1995; Klessen et al. 2000). However, the kinetic energy cannot be increased indefinitely for a cloud of this size without violating the observational constraints on the turbulent velocity field. Observationally, the velocity line width scales with cloud\nsize approximately as v \u221d L0.5 (Larson 1981; Solomon et al.\n1987; Brunt & Heyer 2002; Heyer & Brunt 2004) with a magnitude of v \u2248 1 km s\u22121 on 1 pc scales and a scatter of a factor\nof two (Heyer & Brunt 2004). For a cloud the size of those modelled here (0.375 pc), this gives a typical velocity dispersion of\nv \u2248 0.6 km s\u22121 (Mach 3.3) which is almost a factor of two less\nthan the velocity dispersion of our initial conditions. Thus, our initial conditions are already at the upper end of the observed velocity\ndispersion in molecular clouds so there would appear to be little\nscope for achieving a lower star formation rate by boosting the level\nof turbulence.\nBy contrast, as we have shown through the simulations presented here, a low star formation rate requires only a magnetic field\nof similar strength to observational estimates (i.e. a mass-to-flux\nratio of & 3, Crutcher 1999) and the effects of radiative feedback\nwhich has no large free parameters (once the metallicity is set).\nSimilar results with regards to the reduction in star formation rate\nwith magnetic field strength are found by V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n(2005) in the context of (scale-free) driven turbulence simulations.\nIt therefore appears that both strong magnetic fields and radiative feedback from protostars are crucial ingredients in regulating\nstar formation to a slow and inefficient level, which cannot be neglected from numerical simulations of the star formation process.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the referee for a thorough, critical and helpful report.
