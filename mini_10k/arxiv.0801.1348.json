The interpretation is, in\ngeneral, still very difficult, even though, in principle,\nthe information is contained in the Kubo formula.\nThis is true at least in linear response to the applied\nelectric field. The Kubo formula is therefore the starting\npoint of our analysis of Hall conductivity. We include\nthe spin-orbit interaction and discuss the so called\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE). Previously, most work\nwas focused on understanding the sign change of the\nHall coefficient in ordered and disordered systems1 ,\nlocalization, and the Quantum Hall effect (QHE)2 .\nMore recently, the problem has been to understand the\neffect of magnetism and of many body corrections on\nthe Hall effect. Considerable progress has been made\nrecently by integrating the spin-orbit coupling into the\nBloch wavefunction formalism of Kane in crystals, and\napplying these wavefunctions and other first principle\nnumerical methods3 to study the AHE effect in magnetic\nmaterials4 . In these papers, the emphasis is on order,\nand disorder is only represented by a uniform lifetime.\nMost magnetically doped semiconductors and magnetic\nalloys can, however, not really be considered to be\nin the weak scattering regime, and therefore, in the\npresent approach, we have inverted this priority. We\nemphasize the absence of Bloch symmetry rather than\nits presence5\u201310 .\nThe aim is to develop practical formulae which\ncan deal with disorder, the sign, the side jump Hall\neffect problem, and the Skew scattering/intrinsic Hall\n\neffect problem.\nThe AHE is now a well established observation in\nmagnets, and a number of explanations have been\nproposed7 , and will be discussed here. All explanations\nare based, in one way or another, on the spin-orbit\nmechanism. Thus, it is accepted that spin-orbit coupling\ncauses the anomalous Hall conductivity contribution.\nMuch progress has been made recently on understanding the origin of the AHE and this has generated\nexciting new physics. Traditionally it was thought that\nonly the spin-orbit Skew scattering mechanism 1,11,12 ,\ngives rise to a magnetism (Mz ) dependent Hall coefficient. This process depends on the conductivity\nrelaxation time or relaxation time squared, depending\non whether the skew scattering is itself rate determining\nfor conductivity or not. Traditionally, skew scattering is\nderived as an extrinsic effect, i.e. it is due to impurity\nscattering, and not to the host spin-orbit interaction.\nThe intrinsic spin-orbit interaction produced by the\nhost crystal potential had been invoked as a source of\nAHE by Karplus and Luttinger10 but later rejected by\nSmit13 who claimed that the intrinsic effect is negligible.\nEarlier, it had been shown by Mott and Massey14\nthat electron scattering from Coulomb potentials is\nasymmetric with respect to spin direction, with spin up\ngoing more to one side, and those with spin down more\nto the other. When the electron gas is magnetized, there\nis a net transverse Hall current. When the asymmetric\nscattering is at impurity sites, this process is called skew\nscattering as mentioned above, and has been discussed\nby several authors11,12 . The important point about\n\n\f2\nskew scattering is that the net spin-orbit coupling at\nthe impurity site, can be strongly enhanced by the\nhost crystal. This is really what makes this process so\nimportant. For a detailed account of the history and\nprogress in understanding the AHE see Ref. 8.\nII. THE KUBO FORMULA FOR THE\nLONGITUDINAL AND TRANSVERSE\nCONDUCTIVITY\n\nexplicitly in Section V.\nThe Hall effect is given by the antisymmetric part\nof the transverse conductivity11,17 .\nTo write the\nantisymmetric Hall conductivity, we note that for\nnon-zero frequency it is the anti-hermitian part11\na\n\u2217\n\u03c3xy\n= 12 (\u03c3xy \u2212 \u03c3yx\n). In the dc limit we have\na\n\u03c3xy\n=\n\nX\n~e2\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5\u03b2 )\n\u2212ih\u03b1|vx |\u03b2ih\u03b2|vy |\u03b1i\nlim\n.\n2\n\u03a9 \u03b4\u21920\n(\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 ) + \u03b4 2\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nThe frequency (\u03c9) dependant conductivity in linear\nresponse to an electric field is usually written as1,15,16\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd =\n\nX h\u03b1|v\u03bc |\u03b2ih\u03b2|v\u03bd |\u03b1i f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5\u03b2 )\ni~e2\n.\nlim\n\u03a9 \u03b4\u21920\n\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b2 + ~\u03c9 + i\u03b4\n\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\n\n(6)\nWe shall now derive the Hall conductivity in a general\nway which will include both the skew scattering and the\nintrinsic contributions.\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n(1)\nThis form is general for any exact set of eigenstates\n|\u03b1i and energies \u03b5\u03b1 , spin summation is implied. The\nf (\u03b5) are the Fermi functions and \u03a9 is the volume. The\nvelocity operators v\u03bc are given by Heisenberg's equation\nof motion.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE HALL EFFECT USING A CUMULANT\nEXPANSION OF THE KUBO FORMULA\n\nOne way to derive the contributions to the Hall effect,\nwith disorder present, is to rewrite the Kubo formula\nusing the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n\nFor the general case of a material which need not\nbe periodic, the spin orbit term in the Hamiltonian is\nHso =\n\n~\n(\u2207V (r) \u00d7 p) * \u03c3,\n4m2 c2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nV (r) =\n\nX\nn\n\neZn\n\u2212 eF x.\n4\u03c0\u03b5\u03b50 |r \u2212 Rn |\n\nh\u03b1|vx |\u03b2i\n,\n\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b2\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is true in any finite box (length L) without dissipation.Then Eq. (6) becomes\na\n\u03c3xy\n=\n\n(3)\n\nIn Eqs. (2) and (3), m is the bare electron mass, c is\nthe speed of light, p is the momentum operator and \u03c3\nis the Pauli spin operator which is a vector containing\nthe Pauli's matrices i.e. [\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ]. In Eq. (3), F is\nthe external applied electric field, e the electric charge,\nZn is the effective local charge, \u03b5\u03b50 is the permittivity, r\nand x are positions operators for the charges and Rn is\nthe position of the fixed ions that make the lattice. The\nvelocity operators can then be written as\ni\n~ h\nvx = vx0 +\n,\n(4)\n\u2207\nV\n(r)\u03c3\n\u2212\n\u2207\nV\n(r)\u03c3\nz\ny\ny\nz\n4m2 c2\nvy = vy0 \u2212\n\nh\u03b1|x|\u03b2i = \u2212i~\n\ni\neBz x\n~ h\n, (5)\n\u2207\nV\n(r)\u03c3\n\u2212\n\u2207\nV\n(r)\u03c3\n+\nx\nz\nz\nx\nm\n4m2 c2\n\n2\n\ne\nlim\n\u03a9 \u03b4\u21920\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5\u03b2 ) (\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b2 )\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n(\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 )2 + \u03b4 2\n\nh\u03b1|x|\u03b2ih\u03b2|vy |\u03b1i.\n(8)\n\nWe drop the a superscript for the Hall conductivity, but\nit will be implicit that we refer to the antisymmetric part\nunless otherwise mentioned. In order to demonstrate the\ncumulant technique, we first consider the limits of high\ntemperatures when (\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 ) < kB T and, of small magnetic fields kB T \u226b ~\u03c9c . This is the limit when the matrix elements are dominated by intraband scattering with\nweak B-field. We expand the function\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212\u03b5f\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212\u03b5f\n\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5\u03b2 ) \u2248 e kB T \u2212 e kB T\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u03b5\u03b1 \u2212\u03b5\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u03b5\u03b1 \u2212\u03b5\nf\nf\n\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\n1 \u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\ne kB T \u2212\ne kB T + . . .\nkB T\n2!\nkB T\n(9)\n\nwhere we have used the Landau gauge for the vector\n\u2202\npotential, A = (0, Bz x, 0). The vx0 and vy0 are \u2212 i~\nm \u2202x\ni~ \u2202\nand \u2212 m \u2202y respectively. The choice of the minus sign\nin \u2212eBz x/m implies that e = \u2212|e| since the kinetic\npart of the Hamiltonian for a charge q in a field is\nT = 1/2m(p \u2212 qA)2 .\n\nand substitute Eq. (9) and Eq. (7) into Eq. (6). This\ngives us a cumulant expansion of the Hall conductivity\nin powers of kB1T where one can use the operator identity\n\nThe spin dependent terms in Eqs. (4) and (5) can\nbe important in magnets. We shall consider them\n\nwhere [A, H] is the commutator of A with the Hamiltonian H and A\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03b1|A|\u03b2i, to reduce and evaluate the\n\n(\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 ) A\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03b1|[A, H]|\u03b2i,\n\n(10)\n\n\f3\nterms generated by the expansion.\nThe high T expansion converges rapidly as soon as\nkB T is larger than the typical energy difference in the\nmatrix elements. In particular, this is obviously true\nas soon as kB T exceeds the bandwidth. But, we can\nalso have a more general expansion that may also be\nvalid at low temperature though the justification in this\ncase is more complicated. To obtain the more general\ncumulant expansion at any temperature, we observe\nthat in Eq.

From the\nmathematical structure and to keep the terms linear in\nBz , it is thus essential therefore only to keep the second\norder cumulant at low temperatures. This will now be\nshown step by step as we proceed with the analysis of\nthe various contributions to the Hall current.\nLet us also remember that in Eq. (12), |\u03b1i is a\nmagnetic field dependent exact eigenstate.\nIn order to rewrite the matrix element in a simple\nway, we show in Appendix A, that we can write the\nderivative of the eigenvalue with respect to the magnetic\nfield as\n\ng\u03bcB\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1 (Bz )\n= \u2212e h\u03b1 |xvy | \u03b1i \u2212\n\u2202Bz\n2\n\n*\n\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\n\u03c3zi\n\ni\n\n+\n\n\u03b1 , (13)\n\nwhere vy does not contains the spin-orbit term (Eq.

The\nway to handle this is to introduce initially two different\nmagnetic fields, one acting on the orbital part Borb and\none giving the Zeeman energies Bz . We can thus rewrite\nEq.

(12)), we obtain an infinite series of higher order cumulant which\ncan be generated via Eq. (10). These higher order\ncumulants represent correction to the first order result.\nThe first order term will turn out to have very simple\nphysical interpretation. The corrections generated by\nthe higher order cumulants resulting from Eq. (11), and\nwhen evaluated at low temperatures, must be studied\nin detail as it is not immediately self-evident that they\nrepresent lower order corrections. This is done later in\nthe paper, but at this stage, it is already possible to note\nthat the corrections represent, via Heisenberg's equation\nof motion, and from Eq. (10), higher and higher time\nderivatives of the velocity operator. When using the\neffective mass Hamiltonian, one can show that beyond\nthe second order cumulant, the corrections which are\nlinear in the cyclotron frequency or magnetisation all\nscale with the disorder potential and spin-orbit coupling,\n\nOnly the derivative of the energy eigenvalues with respect to the orbital field Borb gives the Hall conductivity.\nAn advantage of this representation is that the spin-orbit\nenergy can now be treated in first order perturbation\ntheory, as we shall see later.\nThe way disorder should be treated for numerical\ncalculations is as follows. The Hall conductivity as\ngiven by the general conductivity formula (Eq. (1)) or\nthe formulae obtained using the cumulant approach\n(Eq. (14) and equations thereafter) is evaluated for a\nspecific configuration of disorder. The wavefunctions |\u03b1i\nand energies \u03b5\u03b1 are therefore the exact corresponding\neigenstates and eigenvalues. Now the procedure is\nrepeated for all the possible configurations and averaged\nwith the appropriate weighting factors.\nBefore examining the higher order terms (Appendices B and C), let us understand the significance of this\nresult and compare with other well known approaches.\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\nCOMPARISON TO OTHER THEORIES\nA.\n\nwhere N = \u03c1(\u03b5f )m\u2217 vf2 .\n\nThe Streda result\nV.\n\nWe can rewrite Eq.

This author reduced the Kubo formula to\nI\nII\ntwo terms called \u03c3xy\nand \u03c3xy\n(Eq. (15) above). The\nIa\nantisymmetric part of the other term, \u03c3xy\n, should be\ncontained in the remainder of the cumulant expansion.\nOur term (Eq. (15)) differs from Streda's18 by a minus\nsign. The sign problem can be traced in Ref. 18 to one\ntransformation (Eq.(11) of Ref. 18) where there should\nbe a minus sign on the RHS.\nB.\n\nThe classical limit\n\nIf, instead of Eq. (7), we write as in Ref. 19\nh\u03b1|x|\u03b2i = \u2212i~\n\nh\u03b1|vx |\u03b2i\n,\n\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b2 + i~\n\u03c4\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is a lifetime, we can reduce the first term of the\ncumulant expansion to the classical result. By adding\na lifetime, we effectively assume that the electrons are\nsubject to resistive scattering processes. Using the\neffective mass Hamiltonian for the periodic part of\nthe Hamiltonian also allows us to replace m with the\neffective m\u2217 . The finite lifetime then represents all\nthe scattering processes that break the translational\ninvariance of a Bloch electron with effective mass m\u2217 .\nThis includes disorder and electron-phonon scattering\ntreated in the Born approximation. When working in\nthis approximation, there is no configuration average to\nbe done anymore.\nWe consider only the term linear in Bz in Eq. (8),\nthe one involving the eBz x/m part of vy (see Eq. (5)),\nwhich gives the diagonal mass tensor term. Then,\nEq. (8) together with Eq.

New terms arise, due to\nthe spin dependent velocities from Eqs. (4) and (5), and\nfrom the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on the energy\nlevels. We examine this last effect first. Also, as pointed\nout in Section IV B, for the class of problems where we\nhave a periodic system + impurities, wherever the bare\nmass appears in the following text(except when it comes\nfrom the spin-orbit Hamiltonian), we can replace bare\nmass with the effective mass (m\u2217 ) and drop the periodic\npart of the Hamiltonian in the remaining analysis.\nA. The effect of the spin orbit interaction on the\nHall current from the changes in the energy levels\nand wavefunctions\n\nConsider the first order cumulant result with the zero\norder velocity operators (including the \u2212 eBmz x term). The\nadvantage of the cumulant expansion is that it allows\nus to analyze a very complex phenomenon, the effect of\nthe spin-orbit coupling on the Hall conductivity, via the\neigenstates. We write, to first order in perturbation theory,\n\u03b5\u03b1 (Bz ) = \u03b50\u03b1 (Bz ) + h\u03b1|Hso |\u03b1i.\n\n(19)\n\nThe spin orbit Hamiltonian being dependent upon the\nPauli's matrices, we should remember that the state |\u03b1i\nmust now be a spinor (two components vector). The\naction of taking the bracket will leave a scalar and, as we\nuse the same state at this order, only the z component\nsurvive.\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1 (Bz )\n= \u2212eh\u03b1|xvy |\u03b1i\n\u2202Borb\n\u2202\u03b50 (Bz )\n\u2202\n= \u03b1\n+ \u03c3z\u03b1\n\u2202Borb\n\u2202Borb\n\n*\n\n\u03b1\n\nX\ni\n\n+\n\n\u03bbi li,z \u03b1 ,\n(20)\n\nwhere\n\u03bbn =\n\n~eZn\n4m2 c2 (4\u03c0\u03b5\u03b5\n\n0 ) |r\n\n\u2212 Rn |\n\n3,\n\n(21)\n\n\u03c3z\u03b1 \u2261 h\u03b1|\u03c3z |\u03b1i and li,z is the z component of the orbital\nangular momentum at site i.\n\n\u03b2\n\n(17)\n\nThis leads to the very well known classical result\n{1}\n\u03c3xy\n=\n\neBz \u03c4\nN e2 \u03c4 eBz \u03c4\n= \u03c3xx \u2217 ,\n\u2217\n\u2217\nm\nm\nm\n\n(18)\n\nThe first term in Eq. (20) is the one we examined\nabove in the classical limit and is intuitively very attractive. The magnitude of the Hall current per eigenstate\nis related to the sensitivity of the energy level to an\nexternal magnetic field. Its sign depends on whether\n\n\f5\nthe magnetic field increases or decreases the energy of\nthe eigenstate. In particular, it also follows that the\ncontribution of a localized state is negligible. In reality,\nlocalized states should actually give exactly zero. It\ntrivially follows that the zero is recovered only after\nsumming the remaining contributions in the cumulant\nseries. Keeping only the first cumulant does not give\nthe exact result when the level in question is a localized\nlevel, with discrete energy levels. But the first order\nresult is close to zero, and therefore can be said to\nrepresent a good approximation. See Appendix B and C\nfor the analysis of the higher order cumulants.\nFor delocalized states, there is more information in\nthe first term of Eq. (20). Normally, for weak scattering,\nwhen \u03b5f is near the top of the band, we have the hole\nsign, because the magnetic field can only lower the\nenergy near the top of the band. Near the bottom of a\nband, we have the electron sign because the magnetic\nfield confines the carrier and raises the energy of the\nelectrons. This rule is also true for disordered eigenstates. The effect of the magnetic field on the energy\nlevels can be evaluated in second order perturbation\ntheory in the presence of disorder .\nThe anomalous term can now be studied by going\nto first order perturbation theory in B-field with exact\neigenstates. The term \u2212\u03bcB L * Borb generates\n|\u03b1i = |\u03b10 i +\n\nX\n\nh\u03b20 | \u2212 \u03bcB L * Borb |\u03b10 i\n\n\u03b20\n\n|\u03b20 i\n. (22)\n\u03b5\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b20\n\nSubstituting Eq. (22) in the second term of Eq. (20),\nkeeping only the z-components, we obtain terms in the\nenergy which involve a factor of the type\nP\ni,z P j,z\nX i \u03bbi l\u03b1\u03b2\nj l\u03b2\u03b1\nzz\n.\n(23)\n\u2206g\u03b1 =\n\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\nThe sign of the anomalous process depends upon the sign\nof a quantity which is closely related to the electron gshift and which itself can be electron-like or hole-like.\nThus the first order cumulant can be written as\n2\nX \u0012 \u2202f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u0013\n{1}\n{1}(n) e 1\n\u03bcB \u03c3z\u03b1 \u2206g\u03b1zz , (24)\n\u03c3xy = \u03c3xy\n+\n\u2212\n\u03a9 |e| \u03b1\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1\nLet us compare the relative magnitude of the two terms\nof Eq. (24). At very low T ( \u2212 \u2202f\n\u2202\u03b5 = \u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5f ) ) we can\nrewrite the Hall conductivity (Eq. (24)) and the current\nis\nJy =\n\n{1}(n)\n\u03c3xy\nFx\n\n~\n+ e \u03c1(\u03b5f )\nh\u03c3z i\u03b5f \u2206g zz (\u03b5f )Fx .\n2m\n2\n\n(25)\n\nWith \u03c1(\u03b5f ) \u223c 1045 /m3 J and Fx = 104 V/m we have for\nthe anomalous contribution Jyan = 103 \u2206gh\u03c3z iFx A/m2 ,\nwhich is the same order of magnitude as the normal\nprocess with N = 1026 /m3 , giving the normal Hall\n\ncurrent Jyn = 106 A/m2 or 105 (~\u03c9c \u03c4 )Fx A/m2 where\n~\u03c9c \u03c4 \u223c 10\u22123 . In principle, the normal and anomalous\nterms can have opposite signs. The results of Eq. (24)\nand Eq. (25) are very elegant, and by writing \u2206g = 2\u2212g \u2217\nwe have essentially recovered the Fermi level version\nof the Chazalviel20 and Nozi\u00e8res and Lewiner21 result.\nChazalviel20 computes the single carrier wave packet\nmotion in an electric field without using the Kubo linear\nresponse formalism. We also note that in this form,\nthe anomalous term, apparently has no dependence on\nthe relaxation time. Finally, and most importantly,\nit can also be related to the Karplus and Luttinger10\nresult in the limit of high temperature when the Karplus\nand Luttinger energy gap between the Kane Luttinger\nsubbands is taken as \u2206 \u223c kB T and \u2206g \u223c \u03bb\u2206so .\nIn the Karplus-Lutttinger10 Bloch wavefunction\nformalism, the anomalous Hall effect, even though it is\nintrinsic, is a Fermi level property at low temperatures.\nIn Ref. 10, the spin-orbit interaction is treated in first\norder perturbation theory using Bloch functions. We\nhave also used first order perturbation, but the Fermi\nlevel property, here, is a result of keeping the first\norder cumulant. An interesting point is that Karplus\nand Luttinger did not use the Kubo formula. They\narrived at a similar expression, except that the matrix\nelements are always interband matrix elements. The\nreason is that their starting point is the Bloch function,\nso that in the absence of an explicit treatment of\ndisorder scattering, only interband matrix elements\nare left when the matrix elements of position and\nmomentum operators are considered. Note that one\nway of calculating the g-shift, when we have weak disorder, is to use the Kohn-Luttinger wavefunctions. One\ncan compute the g-shift \u2206gk,\u03b1 in the exact band states22 .\nIn summary, in this section, we have derived a result which can be related to the Karplus-Luttinger\nintrinsic AHE10 and we have made contact with the\nChazalviel20 , Nozi\u00e8res and Lewiner21 and Sinova8,9\nresults using a simple and unified formalism.\nB.\n\nThe Side Jump Hall current\n\nThe new velocity terms generated by the spin-orbit\ncoupling in Eqs. (4) and (5) have been shown by W\u00f6lfle\nand Muttalib23 to give rise to a term of a form called\nthe \"side jump Hall effect\" in the linear response Kubo\nformula, which is\nJy = \u2212N e2 h\u03c3z i\n\n~\nFx .\n4m2 c2\n\n(26)\n\nHowever, this result is obtained only after a complex\ndiagrammatic sum of potential scattering events. A\nsimilar result was derived previously and more simply\nfrom the same velocity term by Lyo and Holstein24 using\nscattering theory and originally by Berger25. We shall\n\n\f6\nnow rederive a contribution to the Hall current which\nhas the same structure but is more closely related to\nthe Rashba effect26 . It is derived using linear response\nwith the external field induced spin-orbit term in the\nHamiltonian, below. The linear response analysis will\nshow us how the presence of the lattice goes to modify\nthe Hall conductivity even when we have disorder.\nTreated in linear response, the Rashba coupling term\nwill give a side jump like Hall current. We do not use\nthe cumulant approach or effective mass approximation\nbecause it is easy to treat this term exactly.\nConsider again that part of the spin-orbit coupling\nwhich is itself dependent on the applied external field Fx\n(see Eqs. (3)). This term is a contribution to the total\nenergy which directly depends on the external field. As\npart of the Hamiltonian, this term creates a departure\nfrom equilibrium, and must therefore be treated on the\nsame footing as the usual electric potential eFx x. We\ntherefore start from first principles, with the density\nmatrix. When we take all such terms in the Hamiltonian\nas the perturbation Hpert , the change in the density\nmatrix is given by\n\u2206D\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03b1|Hpert |\u03b2i\n\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5\u03b2 )\n,\n\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\nHpert = \u2212eFx x +\n\n~\n(\u2207Vext (r) \u00d7 p) * \u03c3,\n4m2 c2\n\n(28)\n\nwith Vext (r) = \u2212eFx x.\nThe second term of Eq. (28) involves the external\napplied electric field, and one can use linear response\nand ask: what Hall current does it produce in the\npresence of disorder? We can evaluate the thermally\naveraged velocities in the usual way. We consider the\nexternal-field-independent eigenstates, include disorder\nand the Zeeman splitting. These states can therefore be\npicked to have either spin up or spin down eigenstates\nin a chosen direction. Thus the y-current produced by\nthe second term from Eq. (27) and Eq. (28) is given\nby (spin projection in z-direction and keeping only the\ny-momentum term)\nJy =\n\u001d\n\u001c\ne2 X\n~\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u2212 f (\u03b5\u03b2 ) \u03b1\n\u2212 Fx\npy \u03b2\n\u03c3z .\nh\u03b2|vy |\u03b1i \u03b1\n2\n2\n\u03a9\n4m c\n\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n(29)\n\nIf we now use mvy = py and the sum rule (to be discussed\nin detail in Section V D)\nX |h\u03b1|v\u03bc |\u03b2i|2\n1\n=\n,\n2m\u03b1\n\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03bc = x or y, applied to the y-operator, we have the\nvery simple and elegant result\ne2\nJy = \u2212\n\u03a9\n\n\u0012\n\n~\n4m2 c2\n\n\u0013\n\nFx\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n\nm \u03b1\n\u03c3 ,\nm\u03b1 z\n\n(31)\n\nwhich apparently only depends upon the effective mass.\nThis is true as long as Eq. (30) can be used to define\neffective mass, i.e. if all incoherence is neglected. The\ninterpretation of this sum rule in the Kubo formula\ncontext is not trivial. If we include the entire infinite\nspectrum in the sum of Eq. (30), then we have the trivial\nresult m\u03b1 = m, and we obtain a contribution which\nlooks exactly like the Berger25 and Lyo and Holstein24\nside jump Hall current but is clearly based on a different\nlogic (Rashba term). Note that in our theory, the spin\npolarization is now summed over the entire band and is\nnot just the fermi level spin.\nIn the framework of a finite band model, one can\ninterpret Eq. (30) as the effective mass. The spin-orbit\nterms associated with the lattice can be included in\nEq. (30). In the weak disorder limit, one could compute\nEq. (30) using the Kane method. One can see that, in\nthe Kane model, Eq. (30) is indeed the effective mass.\nThe effective mass correction in Eq. (31) can, then in\nprinciple, increase the current up to two orders of magnitude (InSb for example). But the side jump (Eq. (31))\nis, even with effective mass, for extended states,\nmuch smaller than the Karplus-Luttinger contribution.\nWe have Jy = 10\u221229 h\u03c3z iN Fx A/m in 2-dimensions.\nIn 3-dimensions, with the same numbers we have\n10\u22123 Fx h\u03c3z i(m/m\u2217 ) A/m2 compared to 103 Fx h\u03c3z i\u2206g\nA/m2 from Eq. (25). Note that the huge Bloch function\nenhancement evaluated in various forms by Chazalviel20 ,\nFivaz28 and Berger25 and which make the side jump\nterm important does not appear in Eq. (31). Chazalviel,\nfor example, used the Heisenberg commutator for vy\nand Kane wavefunctions to derive the Hall velocity and\nthen derives a similar expression for the Hall current\nusing Drude theory. We have derived an expression\nwhich is similar in structure to what is called the side\njump Hall current in the literature. The derivation we\nhave used is however not the same as that of Berger25,\nLyo and Holstein24 and W\u00f6lfle and Mutallib23 . In our\nformula, the spin-orbit coupling can be enhanced by the\nlattice, but the effect is relatively small, and directly\nrelated to the effective mass lowering (see Eq.(31)). The\nso-called side jump theories24,25 in which the mechanism\nis due to the spin-orbit scattering induced sideways\njump at impurity potentials, and the associated large\nenhancements caused by Bloch functions, have not been\nrecovered using the present Kubo formula method.\nTo complete the analysis of Eq. (31) we need a\ndiscussion of the sum rule of Eq. (30) and we will defer\nthis to Section V D because a similar term is encountered\nin the next section.\n\n\f7\nC.\n\nThe effect of the spin dependent velocity on the\nHall current: The terms which are due to the\ninternal potentials\n\nLet us consider the contributions to the Hall current\nwhich results from including the contribution of the remaining spin-orbit velocity terms (Eq. (4) and (5)) in the\nKubo formula. These now involve the lattice potentials\nas sources of velocity.

Yn takes alternatively positive and negative values and the term\ninvolving it would be zero if r were not present. But,\neven if we include r, it will always give a smaller\ncontribution compared to the first and we therefore\n1\nneglect it. Second, |r\u2212R\n3 is local and therefore cannot\nn|\ncouple different sites but, in tight-binding for example,\ncould couple different orbitals at the same sites. We\nconsidered that the main contribution comes from the\nmatrix element taken between the same eigenstate and\nthis is why we considered only the |\u03b7i = |\u03b1i term\nin the previous equation. One has to note that the\noriginal integrals in Eq. (32) are convergent but when\n1\none breaks them up, then the integral h\u03b1| |r\u2212R\n3 |\u03b1i is\nn|\nstrictly speaking not convergent because one has taken\none position term y \u2212 Yn out of it. The underlying\nassumption which allows us to make this decoupling is\nthat, the orbit radius is never allowed to be smaller than\nthe effective atomic orbit of the valence state so that the\ncubic singularity does not occur.\nThis term gives rise to a contribution in the first\ncumulant. To obtain it, we start from Eq. (6) instead\nof Eq. (8). We substitute Eq. (32) in Eq. (6) and use\nEq. (7) to transform h\u03b1|y|\u03b2i to h\u03b1|vy |\u03b2i.

(30). Following Datta19 , we will\nassume that, in a crystal, the sum rule of Eq. (30) is\n\nindeed the effective mass. The sum rule (Eq. (30)) will\nbe discussed in detail in Section V D. Note that if we\nuse Eq. (16) with broadening, then an exact result can\nbe obtained by \u0001taking the derivative with respect to the\ninstead of the energy in Eq. (33). This\nbroadening i~\n\u03c4\nrelation will be used to derive Eq. (36) for the strong\nscattering limit.\n\nD.\n\nThe problem of the sum rule of Eq. (30)\n\nThere is a certain arbitrariness in the use of the sum\nrule of Eq. (30) which we should clarify. We note that,\nif we use the standard transformation of Eq. (7), then it\nfollows, in principle, that when we sum over the entire\nreal spectrum of the Hamiltonian, we obtain the free\nelectron mass on the LHS. This is simply a consequence\nof the trivial identity px x \u2212 xpx = \u2212i~ with px = mvx .\nHowever, if we follow Datta19 , and use the linear\nresponse density matrix to compute the acceleration of a\nparticle in an electric field, then we obtain the effective\nmass, in the sense of Newton's law, as given by Eq. (30).\nConsequently, this gives the absurd result that the\naccelerating particle is always free, irrespective of what\nits initial state is. In effect, the trivial result signifies\nthat if we wait long enough, then even a strongly bound\nelectron will eventually be free in an electric field. That\nis, this result (mass is free mass), would represent the\nvery long time behavior, when the history of the particle\nis irrelevant, and its acceleration in a constant field is\ntruly dominated by what happens when it has reached\nits final free state. Datta19 concluded that he should\nuse a finite band in the evaluation of Eq. (30), and then\nthe LHS is indeed the effective mass in the sense of the\ntight-binding band structure, for example.\nThe solution of this problem, in general, seems to\nbe that, in a transport situation, where electrons are\ninjected at one end and absorbed at the other, the sum\ncan only run over that part of the spectrum which is\naccessible\nto the carrier in its lifetime, i.e. for which\nP\n~ \u03b2 |h\u03b1|vx |\u03b2i|2 \u03b4(\u03b5\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 ~\u03c9) is finite. In weak\nscattering, the particle lives in energy levels near the\nFermi level which have an effective mass, because it\nrelaxes and emits energy to the lattice. In a strong\nscattering situation, the kinetic energy of the carrier\ncan be of the same order as the scattering energy\nuncertainty \u03c4~ . So here, we can relate the sum on the\nRHS of Eq. (30) directly to the quantum diffusivity D\u03b10\n(see Appendix D). We proposes therefore, in the strong\nscattering limit, where Bloch's theorem does not apply,\nto define the effective mass, in the sum rule of Eq. (30)\nby the relation\nD0\n1\n= 2c\u03b1 \u03b1 ,\nm\u03b1\n~\n\n(35)\n\n\f8\nwhere c\u03b1 is a constant \u223c\n\nD\n\n(\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212\u03b5\u03b2 )\u03c4\u03b2\n~\n\nE\n\n\u03b2\n\nwhich carries a\n\nsign and is averaged over the band (See Appendix D\nfor a formal representation). It is of order 1 when the\nenergy \u03b5\u03b1 is near the bottom of the band or in a rapidly\nchanging region of the DOS. We shall henceforth absorb\nthis constant in the definition of an effective diffusivity,\nD\u03b1 . Equation (35) is exact (Appendix D).\nIn the random phase limit, c\u03b1 is a relatively weak\nfunction of energy and can be treated as a constant.\nThe unit of time is the scattering time. Acceleration\nwith strong disorder is therefore drift velocity divided\nby scattering time. With the same definition, in the\nsemi-classical limit we therefore have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\nD\u03b1 \u03c4\n1\n\u223c\u2212 2 .\n(36)\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1 2m\u03b1\n~\nIt follows that a localized initial state |\u03b1i has no acceleration without phonons, i.e. at zero temperature, its effective mass in the sense of Eq. (30) is infinite. If one evaluates what diffusivity one needs to reproduce the electron\nmass using Eq. (35), one has D \u223c 1 cm2 s\u22121 which is\nnot a small value in a disordered system. We now have\na way of interpreting terms involving the effective mass\nm\u03b1 . For example, for strong disorder, expressions of the\n2\nP\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n, as encountered in Appendix B for\nform \u03b1 m1\u03b1 \u2202 \u2202\u03b5\n2\n\u03b1\nthe second order cumulant can be written as\nZ\ni 1 \u2202\u03c3(\u03b5)\nD(\u03b5)\u03c1(\u03b5) \u2202 h\n\u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5f ) =\n\u2212\n,\n(37)\n~\n\u2202\u03b5\n~ \u2202\u03b5\n\u03b5f\n\nwith \u03c3(\u03b5) = \u03c1(\u03b5)D(\u03b5), where \u03c3(\u03b5) is the energy dependent conductivity with universal scaling properties near\nmobility edges2 .\nE.\n\nThe resistance dependence of the anomalous\nterm\n\nExperimentally one is normally interested in the\nresistance dependence of the AHE and this is the\ncriterion used to discriminate between possible models.\nFor example, the observed resistance independence of\nthe experimental anomalous Hall conductivity in dilute\nmagnetic semiconductors is taken as proof that the AHE\nis intrinsic. However, it follows from the present analysis,\nthat the apparent scattering-time independence of the\nanomalous Hall conductivity, as derived here in the form\nof Eq. (24), and by Karplus and Luttinger10 , and by\nJungwirth et al.7 constitutes a very special limit. The\nscattering time independence of the g-shift (Eq. (23))\nfollows when the matrix elements are dominated by\ninterband processes where the energy differences are\n\u226b \u03c4~ , (see Ref. 10 for example). But this implies that\nthe basic band structure is Bloch-like, with well-defined\nsemiconductor bands. This is obviously not always the\ncase, and there can be many situations where disorder\n\nand band crossings wash out the Kane subband gaps,\nand give rise to arbitrarily small energy denominators\nin which the lifetime directly enters the AHE as well.\nThus, the g-shift (Eq. (23)) can very well involve the\nconductivity scattering time.\nThe assumption of Bloch functions is made by Jungwirth\net al.7 , and the resistance independence of their result\nalso rests on the existence of well defined subbands,\nand the sums run over all occupied levels. Thus we\nconclude that for strong spin-orbit scattering and weak\ndisorder scattering, the anomalous Hall conductivity\nwill not depend strongly on the resistance, and this then\naccounts for some of the experimental observations on\nthe AHE29 . In contrast, for weak spin-orbit coupling\nand strong disorder, the anomalous Hall conductivity\ncan vary as the scattering time \u03c4 n , 0 < n < 2. The\nBloch matrix elements20 are not appropriate in the\nstrong disorder limit, and the present approach, though\nperturbational, is more appropriate.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Kubo formula was expanded in a cumulant expansion which converges quickly at high temperatures. One\ncan also use the series expansion at lower temperatures,\nprovided one examines the higher order contributions\nfor convergence. Working with the effective mass Hamiltonian, and keeping only the contributions to first order\nin magnetic field allows one to stop the expansion after\nthe second order cumulant . The higher order cumulant\ncontributions are examined in the Appendices B and C.\nThe second order cumulant derived in Appendix B, also\nhas a very interesting structure. It gives terms which\nscale as the derivative of the density of states at the\nFermi level, both for the normal, and the anomalous\ncontributions. Previously, Bush and Guentherodt30 had\nsuggested that the sign of the Hall effect in disordered\nmaterials scales as the sign of the derivative of the density of states at the fermi level (elecron like for increasing\nand vice versa). In the present theory, we have actually\nsuccessfully identified the quantities that determine the\nsign of the Hall effect. Indeed, we have made the very\ninteresting observation that the sign of the normal term\nscales, as expressed in the first term, related to the\nderivative of the energy with respect to B-field. In the\nsecond cumulant contribution, the sign is related to the\nderivative of the density of states at the Fermi level (at\nlow T ). Interestingly the two terms have opposite trends\nbecause an increasing density of states actually gives\nthe hole sign, and not as one would intuitively expect\nand as Bush and Guentherodt30 suggest, the electron\nsign. This is a truly remarkable result when applied to\nthe strong scattering limit, because normally in weak\nscattering, the first term is dominant and that gives\nthe intuitive result from Ref. 30. But in very strong\n\n\f9\nscattering, for example in the amorphous limit, and in\nthe region near the mobility edge, it may happen that\nthe second term dominates. If this happens, then we\nhave a sign anomaly because the increasing density of\nstates at \u03b5f for n-doping gives the hole sign and vice\nversa. This is exactly what is observed in the band edge\nof doped amorphous silicon31 . This observation merits a\nmore detailed investigation which goes beyond the scope\nof this paper.\nIn disordered systems, one can use the CPA (Coherent Potential Approximation)32 to describe the\ndisordered band structure for example33,34 and get\nexplicit results for the sign of the Hall effect. It turns\nout that there is no simple rule for the sign of the Hall\ncoefficient in CPA either, but at the band edges, we\ndo indeed have the same behavior as predicted here.\nThis has been discussed in detail in Refs. 1 and 34.\nIn Ref. 1, the case of an impurity band is also considered.\nThe disadvantage of the cumulant method is that\nthe low temperature limit has to be examined with care\nfor convergence. In situations with Bloch symmetry\nwhere the dominant matrix elements are on the same\nenergy shell, this is no problem. But in general, with\ndisorder, there is, in the present formulation, in lowest\norder in magnetic field Bz , unfortunately, an infinite\nnumber of terms. This seems a big problem at first, but\nthen it resolves itself. The resolution of the difficulty is\n\n\u03c3xy\n\nmost obvious when we apply the first order term in the\nlimit that the states are localized at \u03b5f . We obtain a Hall\nconductivity which is small, but non-zero. This small\ncontribution must be canceled by the remaining linear\nterms in the series. Nevertheless the approximation is\nstill good because it gives a negligible contribution to\nthe Hall current, knowing that the exact result should\nbe strictly zero. Eqs. (B3) and (C1) have terms which\nscale as Bz . They are generally smaller than the first\norder contributions we derived in Section V. However,\nthey involve higher derivatives of the Fermi function and\ncan be dangerous to handle at low T . One may infer\nthat, if the system has a density of states and scattering\ntimes which are only weak functions of energy at the\nFermi level, these higher order cumulant terms are\nnegligible. If the density of states is a strong function\nof energy, the expansion will not converge so easily.\nIndeed, near the band edges, there will be mobility edges\nand localized levels which must give rise to a null result\nwithout phonons, but the null result must be arrived at\nby cancellation of many, albeit, small contributions.\nAt high temperatures, the higher order terms cause no\nproblem and can be neglected. At any temperature\nwe may conclude that a very good approximation is\nobtained by keeping only the first and second cumulants,\nthe spin orbit velocity contribution, and the external\nfield induced spin orbit term. The final approximate\nformula for the Hall conductivity thus becomes\n\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0012\ne2 X\n~\ne2 X ~ \u2202 2 f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) ~|e|Bz\n\u22121 \u2202\u03b5\u03b1\n\u2202f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n\u03b1\nzz\n\u03b1\n=\n+\n\u03c3 \u2206g\u03b1 +\n+ ~\u0393\u03b1 \u03c3z\n\u2212\n\u03a9 \u03b1\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1\n|e| \u2202Borb\n2m|e| z\n2!\u03a9 \u03b1 2m\u03b1 \u2202\u03b52\u03b1\nm\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n\u2202\ne2 ~ X\n1\nm \u03b1 e 2 ~2 X\n\u2212\n\u0393\n\u03c3z\u03b1 .\n\u03c3\n+\n\u2212\nf\n(\u03b5\n)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03a9 4m2 c2 \u03b1\nm\u03b1 z\n\u03a9 \u03b1\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1 2m\u03b1\n\nWe may call Eq. (38) the weak-to-intermediate scattering Hall conductivity. When we evaluate the cumulants,\none can use the effective mass Hamiltonian so that the\nperiodic potential is not part of the Hamiltonian with\nwhich the higher order commutators Eq.(10) are to\nbe evaluated. This means that the only terms which\ncontribute above the 2nd order cumulant, and which\nscale linearly with Bz , will be those which depend on\nthe disorder and spin-orbit part of the Hamiltonian and\nthis makes the approximation of only keeping up to\nsecond order very accurate. Each of the four additive\nterms of Eq. (38) will now be discussed and a simple\ninterpretation given.\nThe first expression in the bracket of the first term\nhas been discussed and is easy to interpret, but it is not\ncompletely trivial to see that it simply reduces to the\n\n(38)\n\nclassical result (Eq. (18)) if we used Eq. (16) or Bloch\nfunctions in the Kubo formula with a constant lifetime.\nIn the pure quantum limit it gives the Streda result but\nit is actually the normal Hall effect. The way this term\nshould be handled depends on the problem in question.\nIn weak scattering it again gives Eq. (18), with a free\nelectron mass. In the tight-binding representation, one\ncan evaluate it using second order perturbation theory\nin the magnetic field dependent term in the Hamiltonian.\nThe second part of the first bracket involves the gshift of the delocalized levels above the mobility edge.\nIn comparison, the localized g-shift is negligibly small.\nIn the weak scattering limit, the g-shift can be evaluated\nusing the Kane-Luttinger wavefunctions10 .\nThis is\ngiven by Roth et al 22 . In an incoherent situation, a\ndisordered system with no Bloch symmetry and strong\n\n\f10\nscattering , we should use m\u03b1 =\n\n~\nD\u03b1\n\nas the effective mass.\n\nFor the second term, the one involving a second\nderivative of the Fermi function, one can, using the\nm\u03b1 = D~\u03b1 approximation, obtain integral products of\nthe type \u03c3(\u03b5) = \u03c1(\u03b5)D(\u03b5) as shown in Eq. (37) which are\nenergy dependent conductivities, and which obey well\nknown universal scaling relations near the mobility edges.\nThe third term was shown to be due to the effect\nof the external-field-induced spin-orbit energy (Section V B). With m\u03b1 = m\u2217 , this term reduces to the\nsame form as the so called side jump contribution.\nOur theory shows that it can be enhanced via a small\neffective mass and even extended to apply to strong\nscattering via Eq. (35).\nConsidering the second and third terms, we propose that, to a good approximation, in most situations\nwhere Bloch functions cannot be used, we may replace\nm\u03b1 = D~\u03b1 , once the sign has been determined via\nEq. (30). This accounts for localized states if any are\npresent, because D\u03b1 is zero.\nThe last term in Eq. (38) is due to the spin-orbit\ncontribution to the velocity operators via the internal\npotentials from Eqs. (4) and (5). This also vanishes\nfor localized states. Above the mobility edge, this\ncontribution is comparable to the second expression\nin the bracket of the second term. This can be seen\nusing the strong scattering correspondence (Eq. (36)).\nThe last term in Eq. (38) then reduces to a term which\nresembles the usual skew scattering term12 provided we\ninterpret the skew scattering rate for Coulomb spherical\npotentials as\n*\n+\nX\nZn\n~e\n1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 .\n(39)\n=\n\u03c4s\u03b1\n4m2 c2 (4\u03c0\u03b5\u03b50 )\n|r \u2212 Rn |3\nn\nThus, for disordered systems, the last term of Eq. (38)\nterm can be written\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~e2 X\n\u2202f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u03c4 mD\u03b1 \u03b1\nskew\n\u03c3xy = \u2212\n\u03c3z .\n(40)\n\u2212\n\u03a9m \u03b1\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1\n\u03c4s\u03b1 ~\nNote that the sum runs over all the potentials in the\nlattice. So the skew scattering and g-shift terms include\nboth extrinsic and intrinsic contributions. Note that\nvery recently, Chudnovsky37 , using a different approach,\nand for spin Hall effect, also obtained a term where all\nthe potentials are included. In the form of Eq. (40),\nappropriate for disordered systems with no Bloch\nsymmetry, the Bloch enhancement does not appear. If\nwe neglect the host spin-orbit coupling and only include\nthe impurities, then both g-shift and skew term are,\nby definition, extrinsic contributions, and the mass\nin Eq. (39) is necessarily the effective mass. It is the\neffective mass particle which generates the impurity\n\nspin-orbit magnetic field.\nLet us now re-examine the question of the theoretical resistance dependence of the AHE. From the above\nanalysis we note that this all has to do with the way\nwe treat the matrix elements, and at what stage we\nintroduce incoherence and lifetime. This can already be\nseen in the first term, which can be treated as a quantum\neffect, as in Streda18 or in the semi-classical limit. The\nsame is true for the spin-orbit terms. Thus, if we keep\nto the notion of effective mass, we have the quantum\nresult. If we use the transformation of Eq. (35), which\ninvolves the diffusivity, then we have the connection\nwith conductivity. As an example, we can take the first\ntwo, dominant, terms in Eq. (38) and write them, using\nthe definition of the g-shift given by Roth et al.22 (we\nassume \u2206 and Eg to still be defined), in the incoherent\nlimit as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\neBz \u03c4\n(1)\n\u03c3xy\n= \u03c3xx\n+\nm\u2217\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ne2 X\nD\u03b1\n\u2202f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) ~ \u03b1\n\u2206\n,\n\u03c3z \u2212 m\n\u22121\n\u2212\n\u03a9 \u03b1\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1\nm\n~\n3Eg + 2\u2206\n(41)\nwhere we have used Eq. (35) in the g-shift term.\nNow, we see that what was a pure quantum term with\neffective mass, has, in this limit, become a term which\ndepends on the diffusivity. The AHE Hall coefficient can,\nit seems, change from a linear scaling with resistance\nin Eq.(41) to a resistance squared (relaxation time\nsquared) behavior if D~\u03b1 becomes m\u22121\n\u03b1 , as is observed in\ndiluted magnetic semiconductors29 . The experimentally\nobserved RA \u221d \u03c12xx dependence implies, therefore, that\nthe effective mass concept remains valid in these systems.\nWe have focused our attention on the anomalous\ncontributions, and how they undergo a transformation,\nin going from the weak scattering to the strong scattering\nlimit. A similar change must occur for the first term of\nEq. (41). Here too, we must replace the Drude \u03c3xx by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2202f (\u03b5)\n\u03c1(\u03b5)D(\u03b5)\n(42)\n\u03c3xx = e2 d\u03b5 \u2212\n\u2202\u03b5\nand the band mobility term\n\ne\u03c4 Bz\nm\u2217\n\nby\n\nD\ne\u03c4 Bz\n= eBz\n,\n\u2217\nm\nh\u03b5i\n\n(43)\n\nat low temperatures. The notation in terms of diffusivity\nD is valid in the weak scattering limit too, but now one\ncan see what happens as we approach the mobility edge\nusing standard localization theory and \u03c3(\u03b5) = \u03c1(\u03b5)D(\u03b5).\nWe have shown that the AHE Hall coefficient RA\ncan vary with resistance \u03c1nxx with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 depending\n\n\f11\non the degree of coherence. The essential point seems to\nbe the way one treats the sum rule given by Eq. (30).\nThis was already a problem for Datta19 in his analysis\nof the Hall effect in his 1980 paper. Eq. (30) may be\ntreated as the well known f-sum rule, but it is clearly not\nrealistic to sum over an infinite excited state spectrum,\nwithout taking into account the finite lifetime of the\nstates. The question then becomes: when is the sum\n1\non the RHS of Eq. (30) 2m\n\u2217 and when is it closer to\nD\nwhich\nis\nthe\nsum\nevaluated\nin the semi-classical\n~\nlimit, and also derivable from h\u03b1|x2 |\u03b1i \u223c D\u03b1 \u03c4 ? The\ninteresting and important side of this last result, is that\nit gives the correct null result for transport in localized\nstates, and therefore must be the correct approximation\nnear the mobility edges.\nWe have derived a side-jump-like contribution to\nthe Hall current using linear response to the (Rashba)\nspin-orbit interaction26 which is produced by motion\nin the external potential. Our result is closely related\nto the Rashba current26 and is in principle, exact, up\nto the evaluation of the sum rule (Eq. (30)). The sum\nrule has to be treated with care in both the coherent\nand the strong scattering limit. In the incoherent limit,\nand specially near mobility edges, we have the relation\nm\u03b1 = D~\u03b1 which then gives a very appealing result,\nnamely\nsj\n\u03c3xy\n=\u2212\n\ne2 ~ X\nmD\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03c3z\nf (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n2\n2\n\u03a9 4m c \u03b1\n~\n\n(44)\n\nThis gives a vanishing side-jump-like Hall effect (Rashba)\ncontribution from those states in the localized part of\nthe band.\nAdding Eqs. (44) and Eq. (41) we have the strong\nscattering Hall conductivity limit. As in the QHE,\nevery conducting state contributes. However, the full\nenhancement of the spin-orbit coupling (see Ref. 27 and\nRef. 12 for example) does not appear in our expression. The most interesting aspect of the side-jump-like\n(Rashba) term (Eq. (44)), is that if the Fermi level\nis in a region of localized states, say near the top of\nthe band, then this term dominates the Hall current\nsince all other terms are Fermi level terms, and vanish\nat low temperatures. It would give us (using the free\nmass) Jy \u223c 10\u221229 Ndel h\u03c3z iFx A/m2 (Ndel = delocalized\nelectrons density) which is, of course, a small but rigid\ncurrent, analogous to the Quantum Hall current.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe principal result of the cumulant method developed\nin this paper is given by Eq. (38). It is an expression for\nthe Hall current which allows for disorder and spin-orbit\ncoupling. For a typical doped semiconductor, we might\nexpect the following contributions to the Hall effect:\n\n1. The normal process (first term of Eq. (41)).\n2. The intrinsic AHE side jump like process (Rashba\nterm, Eq.(44)).\n3. The intrinsic AHE Karplus-Luttinger process (second term of Eq. (41)).\n4. The skew scattering process due to impurities\n(Eq. (40)). Here, the basic spin-orbit coupling has\nthe effective mass and not the free mass.\nThe skew term (Eq. (40)) is only relevant if both the\nenhancement and the basic spin-orbit coupling are large\nand the concentration of impurities high enough (see\nRef. 12 for estimates). The side-jump term is only important if the effective mass is small or the Fermi level is in\na region of localized states. In most situations with weak\ndisorder, we expect the Karplus-Luttinger intrinsic term\nto dominate the AHE. In the limit of strong scattering,\nwhen the use of Bloch functions and uniform lifetimes\nis no longer valid, we may replace the effective mass in\nEq. (38) using the concept of quantum diffusivity i.e. put\nD\u03b1\nm\u22121\n\u03b1 \u2192 ~ , and use derivatives, as explained in the text.\nFor magneto-optical, Faraday angle measurements,\nfor example, we need the frequency dependent Hall\nconductivity. One can show that in weak scattering,\nwhere we use the effective mass for Eq. (30), we add\n1\na factor 1+(\u03c9\u03c4\n)2 to the four main Hall conductivity\nresults listed above. In strong scattering, where we use\nthe diffusivity to describe Eq. (30), D(\u03b5) is replaced by\nD(\u03b5, \u03c9).\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Pr.

(A3) to obtain Eq. (13). To do so, we just apply the\nD well known\nE\n\u2202H\nHellman-Feynman theorem and we obtain \u03b1 \u2202B\n\u03b1\n=\nz\n\u2202\u03b5\u03b1\n\u2202Bz\n\nand thus Eq. (13). Remember that vy in the equation does not contains the spin-orbit term of Eq. (5).\nAPPENDIX B: THE SECOND ORDER TERMS\nIN THE CUMULANT EXPANSION\n\nConsider now the second order contribution to the Hall\nconductivity. This can be written\n\u2202 2 f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\ne2 X\n{2}\n(B1)\nh\u03b1|x|\u03b2ih\u03b2|Hvy \u2212 vy H|\u03b1i\n\u03c3xy\n=\n2!\u03a9\n\u2202\u03b52\u03b1\n\nAgain, at low T (neglecting other energy dependence under the integral), we can use\nX \u2202 2 f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n\u2202\u03b52\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03b5\n\n\u03b5=\u03b5f\n\n.\n\n(B6)\n\n\u03c1\nIf we assume that \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03b5 \u03b5=\u03b5f \u223c \u03b5f , again, we have the\nsame structure as before in Eq. (25), this time with\n\u03b1i\n\u22124\neV, this\n\u2206g = ~h\u0393\n\u03b5f . With the numerator of order 10\nterm corresponds to an effective g-shift of 10\u22124 which\nis therefore smaller than the first order cumulant of its\ntype. But, in general we remind the reader that the cumulant expansion, as is also true for the configurationally\ndecoupled Kubo formula, is not accurate near the band\nedges for reasons of Anderson localisation. When used in\nthis region it can only apply above the mobility edge.\n\nAPPENDIX C: THIRD ORDER CUMULANT\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\neBz x\n\u2202\nwhere, as previously, vy = \u2212i~\nm \u2202y \u2212 m , dropping the\nspin-orbit current operator. After evaluating the commutator we are left with three terms\neBz 0 i~ \u2202V\ni~ X\ni~\nvx ,\n, \u2212 px\n\u03bbn \u03c3z .\n(B2)\nm\nm \u2202y\nm\nn\n\nOnly the first and third term give significant contributions in this order. The first term is\neBz 0 \u2202 2 f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\ne2 X\n{2}\nv |\u03b1i\nh\u03b1|x|\u03b2ih\u03b2|i~\n\u03c3xy,1 =\n2!\u03a9\nm x\n\u2202\u03b52\u03b1\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n(B3)\n\u0013 2\n\u0012\ne2 ~2 eBz X\n\u2202 f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n1\n=\n,\n\u2212\n2!\u03a9 m\n2m\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b52\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nwhere we have used the sum rule of Eq. (30) restricted\nto the active energy band. For Bloch states restricted to\nthe 8-Kane bands with spin-orbit coupling, the RHS of\nEq. (30) reproduces the 8-bands k * p calculated effective\nmasses. To conclude, we note that the cumulant expansion is a powerful method when the bandwidth is very\nnarrow and < kB T . At low temperatures, when we use\nm\u03b1 = m\u2217 , we obtain for Eq. (B3)\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne2 ~ ~eBz \u2202\u03c1(\u03b5)\n{2}\n.\n(B4)\n\u03c3xy,1 = \u2212\n2! m 2m\u2217\n\u2202\u03b5 \u03b5=\u03b5f\nNote that the cumulant expansion is not purely an expansion in powers of Bz . There is a term linear in Bz in\nalmost every order. Using the effective mass method, the\nlinear term in Bz becomes an expansion in powers of the\nVdisorder /\u03b5f . The convergence is problematic near band\nedges where we have localization. We neglect the term\ngiven by the second term of Eq. (B2). The spin-orbit\nterm, given by he third term of Eq. (B2), becomes\n{2}\n\n\u03c3xy,3 =\n\ne 2 ~2 X 1\n\u2202 2 f (\u03b5\u03b1 ) \u03b1\n\u0393\u03b1\n\u03c3z .\n2!\u03a9 \u03b1 2m\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b52\u03b1\n\n(B5)\n\nIn the third order cumulant, if we neglect terms of\norder Bz2 and \u03bb2 , we have only the terms\ne2 X 1 \u2202 3 f (\u03b5\u03b1 )\n3!\u03a9 \u03b1 m\u03b1 \u2202\u03b53\u03b1\n# +\n*\n\"\n~\n~eBz X\n2 2\n+\n.\n~\u03bbn (r)h\u03c3z i \u03b1\n\u03b1 x \u2207y V (r)\nm\nm\nn\n(C1)\n\n{3}\n\u03c3xy\n=\n\nThe terms linear in Bz and spin-orbit coupling always\ngo in pairs, the spin-orbit term acting like an effective\nmagnetic field. The higher order terms form an infinite\nseries with products involving derivatives of the lattice\npotential. These terms are small at high temperature\nand renormalize the first order linear terms in Bz and\n\u03bbn . In the effective mass approach, the lattice potential\nno longer appears in the Hamiltonian so V (r) appearing\nin Eq. (C1) is due to impurities or disorder.\n\nAPPENDIX D: EFFECTIVE MASS AND\nDIFFUSIVITY IN THE STRONG SCATTERING\nLIMIT\n\nSince the excited states can decay and must have a\nfinite lifetime, we can write the sum of Eq.
