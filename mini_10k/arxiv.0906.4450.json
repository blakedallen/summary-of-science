We fill an apparent gap in the\nliterature concerning the theoretical structure of one of the relevant screening masses (the\none which equals twice the Debye mass at leading order), by showing that the next-to-leading\norder correction to it is perturbative and small. This surprising result appears to explain\nsemi-quantitatively why this particular channel yields the smallest gluonic screening mass at\ntemperatures around a few hundred MeV (it couples to the energy density and to the real\npart of the Polyakov loop), even though it is not among the smallest screening masses at\nasymptotically high temperatures.\n\nSeptember 2009\n\n\f1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nScreening masses, or inverses of equal-time correlation lengths, are a fundamental characteristic of the long-range properties of a thermal system. Indeed, the quantum numbers and the\ndegeneracy of the excitation with the lowest screening mass indicate what kind of an effective\ntheory it is that determines the infrared sensitive thermodynamic properties of the system,\nsuch as finite volume effects [1]. In QED, for instance, correlators of magnetic fields display\na vanishing screening mass, while correlators of electric fields reveal a non-vanishing \"Debye\nmass\"; this then shows that at the longest length scales only magnetic fields are significant\nin an Abelian plasma, and finite-volume effects are powerlike.\nIn non-Abelian gauge theories such as QCD, it turns out that the situation with the\nscreening masses is a bit more complicated than in QED. In fact, even the definition of what\nis meant by screening masses requires some care: electric and magnetic fields, on which our\nAbelian intuition is based, are no longer gauge-invariant objects. Because of these subtleties\nit was only in the mid-1990's that fully satisfactory gauge-invariant and non-perturbative\ndefinitions were given to colour-electric, colour-magnetic, and certain more refined classes of\nscreening masses in a non-Abelian plasma [2].\nFollowing the conceptual clarification of the gauge-invariant definition of gluonic screening\nmasses in QCD, systematic lattice measurements could also be carried out in all relevant\nchannels. We would like to mention, in particular, quenched lattice measurements in four\ndimensions [3, 4]; unquenched lattice measurements via a dimensionally reduced effective field\ntheory in three dimensions [5]; and, most recently, unquenched lattice measurements directly\nin four dimensions [6]. Of course, a systematic analysis of the same observables can also be\ncarried out in the AdS/CFT framework [7].\nThe purpose of the present paper is to consider the screening masses within the weakcoupling expansion. A number of them fall into the general class of observables whose leadingorder value is fixed by the Debye scale; this class includes also many real-time observables\nof current interest, such as heavy-quark diffusion and jet quenching. It has been found in\nseveral such cases that the next-to-leading order correction is large for phenomenologically\ninteresting values of the gauge coupling [8]. Our results will produce a \"counter-example\" to\nthis empirical observation, showing that it is also possible to find observables in which the\nnext-to-leading order correction is small.\n\n2.\n\nGeneral framework\n\nIn order to implement the resummations that are needed for defining the weak-coupling\nexpansion at high temperatures, we choose to view the screening masses with the help of\nthe dimensionally reduced effective field theory for hot QCD [9], called EQCD [10]. This\n1\n\n\fapproach is certainly sufficient for clarifying the theoretical structure of the various screening\nmasses and, at least on the semi-quantitative level, also for numerical estimates. The effective\nLagrangian has the form\nLE =\n\n1\nTr [Fij2 ] + Tr [Di , A0 ]2 + m2E Tr [A20 ] + ... .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere Fij = (i/gE )[Di , Dj ], Di = \u2202i \u2212 igE Ai , Ai = Aai T a , A0 = Aa0 T a , and T a are hermitean\ngenerators of SU(3). In three dimensions the dimensionality of gE2 is GeV. A 2-loop derivation\nof m2E , gE2 in terms of the parameters of four-dimensional QCD can be found in ref. [11].\nCorrelation lengths are defined from the exponential fall-off of two-point functions of local\ngauge-invariant operators. Without a loss of generality we assume the two-point functions\nto be measured in the x3 -direction. The independent channels can be classified according to\ndiscrete symmetries defined in the two-dimensional transverse (x1 , x2 )\u2212plane. A particularly\nimportant symmetry is often called R, and corresponds to the CT-symmetry of the original\nQCD; in terms of eq. (1), it sets A0 \u2192 \u2212A0 . \"Colour-electric operators\" are defined to be\nodd under this symmetry, while \"colour-magnetic operators\" are even [2].\nWith this notion, examples of operators from which colour-electric screening masses can\nbe determined are Tr [A0 F12 ] and Tr [A30 ]. In four-dimensional QCD, these correspond to\nIm Tr [P F12 ] and Im Tr [P ], respectively, where P is the yet untraced Polyakov loop (we\nassume that the center symmetry is broken in the \"trivial\" direction, as is certainly the case\nin the unquenched theory). Note that these two channels do not couple to each other because\nof a different parity in the transverse plane. Typical operators from which colour-magnetic\n2 ], but any other gauge-invariant\nscreening masses can be determined are Tr [A20 ] and Tr [F12\nlocal singlet operator such as the energy density works as well. In four-dimensional QCD,\nTr [A20 ] corresponds to Re Tr [P ].\n2 ] couple to each\nIt is important to note that in principle the operators Tr [A20 ] and Tr [F12\nother [12, 13]. In other words, if we measure a correlation matrix between these operators,\nthen the matrix includes non-diagonal components. It is possible, however, to diagonalize\nthe correlation matrix at large distances, i.e. to find two orthogonal eigenstates which display\ndifferent screening masses (see, e.g., refs. [14]). It is these eigenvalues of the two-dimensional\nHamiltonian that we refer to as M2 and M3 in the following. In practice, the coupling between\n2 ] is very weak, both parametrically [13] and numerically [5], so it appears\nTr [A20 ] and Tr [F12\nto us that it should play no actual role in our analysis.\nAssuming that mE \u226b gE2 /\u03c0, as is indeed the case at very high temperatures (in which\nlimit mE \u2248 gT (Nc /3 + Nf /6), gE2 \u2248 g2 T , where g 2 /4\u03c0 = \u03b1s is the strong gauge coupling,\nNc is the number of colours, and Nf is the number of massless quark flavours), we can view\nA0 as a heavy field and write down the parametric forms of various screening masses within\n\n2\n\n\fthe heavy-mass expansion1 . In particular, the smallest screening mass in the colour-electric\nchannel, coupling to Tr [A0 F12 ], has a well-known logarithmic term at the next-to-leading\norder [15], and the general form [2]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmE\ngE2 Nc\nln 2 + c1 ,\n(2)\nM1 \u2248 mE +\n4\u03c0\ngE\nwhere c1 \u2248 6.9 for Nc = 3 [16]. This expression works reasonably well down to low temperatures, overestimating the \"exact\" value within EQCD by a modest amount [5]. In the\ncolour-magnetic channel, we can expect the mass coupling to Tr [A20 ] to have, in the heavymass limit, the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmE\ngE2 Nc\nln 2 + c2 .\nM2 \u2248 2mE +\n(3)\n4\u03c0\ngE\nRoughly, the correction here represents a three-dimensional bosonic analogue of the binding\nenergy of a heavy quark-antiquark system, like J/\u03c8. As far as we can see it is a non-trivial\nfact, following from the analysis in sec. 4, that the coefficient of the logarithm in eq. (3)\nagrees with that in eq. (2). The colour-magnetic screening mass which is the smallest at\nasymptotically high temperatures can, in contrast, be obtained from the theory from which\n2 ] and has the form\nA0 has been integrated out [13]; it couples dominantly to Tr [F12\nM3 \u2248\n\ngE2 Nc\n\u00d7 c3 ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere c3 \u2248 10.0 for Nc = 3 [17].\n\n3.\n\nNon-relativistic limit\n\nOur goal now is to estimate the coefficient c2 in eq. (3) which, to the best of our knowledge,\nremains unknown. The situation is quite similar to that in the case of the screening masses of\nfermionic bilinears, which we have studied previously in refs. [18, 19]. The two adjoint scalar\nfields form a bound state, and a formal scale hierarchy exists between the heavy scalar mass,\n1\nmE ; the relative momentum between the bound state constituents, p \u223c (gE2 mE /\u03c0) 2 ; and the\nbinding energy, \u2206E \u223c gE2 /\u03c0, such that p2 /mE \u223c \u2206E (logarithms and numerical factors have\nbeen omitted; note that in terms of the four-dimensional coupling the scales are separated\nonly by \u223c (g/\u03c0)1/2 ). This scale hierarchy can be employed for constructing a set of effective\nfield theories, perhaps ultimately a scalar analogue of PNRQCD [20]. As argued in ref. [18],\nhowever, at the level of the correction of O(gE2 /\u03c0), the whole procedure simply amounts to\nsolving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a two-dimensional Coulombic potential for the s-wave\n1\n\n2\nWe stress that at this point the scale hierarchy mE \u226b gE\n/\u03c0 serves only as a theoretical organizing principle\nfor the computation; in practical estimates various group theory and numerical factors need to be added, and\nthe phenomenological viability of the description can only be estimated a posteriori.\n\n3\n\n\fstate; the only complication is that the heavy constituent \"rest mass\" entering the bound\nstate problem needs to be fixed by a proper matching computation.\nTo nevertheless give a somewhat more concrete indication of the effective theory setup, let\nus carry out a Wick rotation from the 3-dimensional Euclidean theory to a (2+1)-dimensional\nMinkowskian theory, and rename the x3 -coordinate to be time, t. Let us, furthermore, write\nthe time dependence of the quadratic part of the action in Fourier space, with \u03c9 denoting\nthe frequency:\nZ Z\ni\no\nn\nh\n(5)\nTr A0 (\u2212\u03c9, x) \u2212\u03c9 2 + m2E \u2212 \u22072 A0 (\u03c9, x) + . . . .\nSE =\n\u03c9\n\nx\n\nIf we concentrate on modes close to the on-shell points, |\u03c9 \u00b1mE | \u223c gE2 /\u03c0 \u226a mE , and write \u03c9 =\nmE +\u03c9 \u2032 or \u03c9 = \u2212mE \u2212\u03c9 \u2032 , then we observe that the dynamics of the forward-propagating mode\n\u2032\n\u2032\nA\u20320 (\u03c9 \u2032 , x) \u2261 A0 (mE +\u03c9 \u2032 , x) and the backward-propagating mode A\u2032\u2020\n0 (\u03c9 , x) = A0 (\u2212mE \u2212\u03c9 , x)\nis determined by the non-relativistic Lagrangian\n\u0010\nn \u0010\n\u22072 \u0011 \u2032\u2020 o\n\u22072 \u0011 \u2032\n\u2032\ni\u2202\n\u2212\nA\n+\nA\nA0 .\nLE \u2248 2mE Tr A\u2032\u2020\n\u2212i\u2202\n\u2212\nt\nt\n0\n0\n0\n2mE\n2mE\n\n(6)\n\nIn configuration space, the original field A0 is related to the new effective fields by A0 =\ne\u2212imE t A\u20320 + eimE t A\u2032\u2020\n0 . At leading order, then, the forward-propagating part of the composite\n2\noperator Tr [A0 (t)] has the energy eigenvalue 2mE .\nWhen this argumentation is promoted to the quantum level, we expect the derivatives\nappearing in eq. (6) to get replaced by covariant derivatives, \u2202t A\u20320 \u2192 [Dt , A\u20320 ]; the rapid\noscillation frequency mE to get replaced by a matching coefficient, which we denote by\nMrest ; and the parameter mE in the denominator of the kinetic term in eq. (6) to become another matching coefficient, which we denote by Mkin . In the limit Mkin \u2192 \u221e\nthe propagators of the A\u20320 's are replaced by Wilson lines in the adjoint representation:\nT\n\u2032b\n\u2032b\n\u2032a\nG(t, r) \u2261 A\u2032a\n0 (t, r)A0 (t, 0)A0 (0, r)A0 (0, 0) = Tr {Uadj (t, r)Uadj (t, 0)}, where Uadj (t, r) is\na straight timelike adjoint Wilson line at spatial position r and we have for brevity omitted\nthe (non-unique) spacelike connectors that make the point-split operators gauge-invariant.\nThe evaluation of this expectation value leads to the concept of a static potential in the usual\nway: V (r) = limt\u2192\u221e [i\u2202t G(t, r)]G\u22121 (t, r). For the actual bound state problem Mkin \u2248 mE\nstays finite and the static potential takes the role of a matching coefficient. We do not need\nto know more about the effective theory setup in the following but remark that a formal\ndiscussion can be found in ref. [22].\n\n4\n\n\f4.\n\nDetermination of M2\n\nProceeding now with the non-relativistic setup outlined above, we expect that in the heavy\nmass limit the bound state mass can be written as\nM2 \u2248 2Mrest + \u2206E .\n\n(7)\n\nIn dimensional regularization in d = 3\u22122\u01eb spatial dimensions, the next-to-leading order value\nof the matching coefficient Mrest reads [2]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bc\u03042\ngE2 Nc 1\n+ ln\n+1 ,\n(8)\nMrest = mE \u2212\n8\u03c0\n\u01eb\n4m2E\nwhere \u03bc\u0304 is the scale parameter of the MS scheme. The binding energy can be solved from a\ntwo-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation; the potential appearing in it, obtained by integrating\nout the time (or x3 ) components of the gauge fields reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 2\u22122\u01eb\nd\nq 1 \u2212 eiq*r\n\u03bc\u03042 r 2\ngE2 Nc 1\nV (r) = gE2 Nc\n+\nln\n+\n2\u03b3\n=\n.\n(9)\nE\n(2\u03c0)2\u22122\u01eb\nq2\n4\u03c0\n\u01eb\n4\nIn total, then, we are looking for the ground state solution to the problem\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u22072r\n+ V (r) \u03a80 = M2 \u03a80 ,\n2Mrest \u2212\nmE\nwhere the non-kinetic terms combine to the finite expression\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\ngE2 Nc\nln(mE r) + \u03b3E \u2212\n.\n2Mrest + V (r) = 2mE +\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nIn the kinetic term of eq. (10), we already expanded the (\"reduced\" version of the) matching\ncoefficient Mkin to leading order in gE2 /\u03c0mE , as is sufficient at the current level of accuracy.\nIt is important to note that, unlike speculated in earlier works [21], no infrared divergences\nappear in eq. (11). The reason is that the logarithmic divergences originating from the \"hard\"\nmomenta (q \u223c mE ; eq. (8); viewed from this side 1/\u01eb is an infrared divergence) and the \"soft\"\nmomenta (q \u223c 1/r; eq. (9); viewed from this side 1/\u01eb is an ultraviolet divergence) of the\nspatial gluons Ai cancel against each other in eq. (11).\nCarrying out suitable rescalings, eq. (10) can be solved up to one transcendental number.\nWe thus obtain\n\u0011\ng2 Nc \u0010\n1\nM2 \u2248 2mE + E\n0.60372466 \u2212 ln \u03c1 ,\n(12)\n2\u03c0\n2\nwhere\nNc\ng2 Nc\n=\n.\n(13)\n\u03c1\u2261 E\n2\u03c0mE\n2\u03c0y 1/2\n5\n\n\f1.1\n1.0\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\nmE / gE\n\n0.9\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n=0\nNf\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5 0\n10\n\n1\n\nT/\u039b_\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nMS\n\nFigure 1: The parameter mE /gE2 = y 1/2 from eq.

(12) with eq. (3), we obtain\nc2 \u2248 1.9467141\n\n(15)\n\nfor Nc = 3. Given that mE \u2265 0.5gE2 (cf. fig. 1), the latter term in eq. (3) is always subdominant.\nThis is in stark contrast to eq. (2), in which the latter term, containing the non-perturbative\ncoefficient c1 \u2248 6.9, dominates in the whole temperature range of phenomenological interest.\nNote that because c2 \u226a c3 \u2248 10.0, M2 is in general also below M3 (cf. eq. (4)) in the\ntemperature range of fig. 1. All three masses are plotted in fig. 2, both in units of gE2 and in\nunits of T .\n\n6\n\n\f8.0\nM3 / T\n\n2.5\n2\n\nM3 / gE\n\n6.0\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n2.0\n\nM2 /\n\nM2 / T\n\n4\n\nM1 / gE\n\n4.0\n\n2\nN =\nf\n0\n\n=0\nNf\n\n2\ngE\n\n3\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\nT/\u039b_\n10\n\n10\n\n0.0 0\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n_\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nT/\u039bMS\n\nMS\n\nFigure 2: Left: The masses M1 , M2 , M3 (cf. eqs. (2)\u2013(4)), in units of gE2 , for Nc = 3, after insertion\nof mE /gE2 from eq. (14). For better visibility, the four curves for M3 , which are degenerate, have been\nslightly displaced from each other. Right: The masses M2 , M3 , which belong to the same quantum\nnumber channel, after the insertion of the 2-loop value for gE2 /T from ref. [11].\n\nTo summarize, it appears understandable that M2 represents the smallest screening mass\nat realistic temperatures, because of the small perturbative coefficient c2 \u2248 1.9 in its next-toleading order term, even though in the extreme limit mE \u226b gE2 /\u03c0 it eventually overtakes both\nM1 and M3 , because a higher multiple of mE 's appears in the leading term. This observation,\ntogether with the explicit results in fig. 2, constitute the main points of this note.\nWe would like to stress, finally, that although our result for M2 is not meant to be quantitatively accurate at low temperatures, it nevertheless reveals an interesting pattern. For\nexample, for Nf = 0, fig. 2 suggests M2 /T \u2248 3...4 in the phenomenologically interesting temperature range, while lattice measurements indicate values M2 /T \u2248 2.5...3 [3, 4], i.e. in the\nsame ballpark but deviating downwards on the quantitative level. It appears, though, that\nthis difference could at least partly be understood through higher order corrections within\nthe EQCD effective theory defined by eq. (1): for T /\u039bMS \u2248 2, the non-perturbative lattice\nmeasurements in ref. [5] yielded M2 /gE2 \u2248 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6 for Nf = 0, 2, 3, 4, respectively, and\nM1 /gE2 \u2248 1.7, 2.0, 2.1, 2.1 for the same cases; these values lie consistently somewhat below the\nperturbative estimates in the left panel of fig. 2, resulting in a better accord with 4d lattice\ndata. Moreover, a similar overshooting of the O(gE2 )-corrected screening masses has been\nfound for mesonic observables [18, 19]. So, it might be the general case that higher-order\ncorrections, mostly from within three-dimensional EQCD dynamics, sum up to a negative\ncorrection to the next-to-leading order expression for screening masses. This would imply\nthat screening masses are different in character from some dynamical quantities like the heavy\n7\n\n\fquark momentum diffusion coefficient, in which case higher order corrections appear to add\nup on top of the already large next-to-leading order correction [24].\n\n6.\n\nAn open issue\n\nWe end by briefly pointing out an open problem to which we have no solution. Consider\nthe screening mass extracted in four dimensions from the imaginary part of the Polyakov\nloop; in EQCD this corresponds to M (Tr [A30 ]). In weak coupling, M (Tr [A30 ]) = 3mE +\n2N\ngE\nc\nmE\n2\n4\u03c0 (c4 ln gE\n\n+ c5 ). Even though this is heavier than M1 , particularly for Nf > 0 [5], it\ncan be easily measured on the lattice [6], since the corresponding operators have different\nquantum numbers. Therefore, it would be nice to know the coefficients c4 , c5 . Though\nthis is certainly a well-defined problem (for Nc > 2), we have no clear idea about how it\ncould be solved in a systematic way. (Probably the system can still be described by a nonrelativistic many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a certain three-body potential in it, but in\nthe absence of an effective theory framework or an explicit power-counting argument, it is\ndifficult to know for sure how to proceed without ambiguities.) If the pattern found in this\nnote continues, however, we might expect c4 , c5 to be coefficients at most of order unity, such\nthat the leading-order term would dominate even more than in M2 .\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to K.
