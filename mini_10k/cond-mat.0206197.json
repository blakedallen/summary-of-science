The variational wave function is constructed from the eigenstates\nobtained from Bogoliubov de Gennes mean field Hamiltonian for the twodimensional t \u2212 J model. A Jastrow factor is introduced to account for the\ninduced magnetic moment and the repulsion between holes and the impurity.\nA substantial energy gain is obtained by forming an antiferromagnetic polarization covering 4 or 5 lattice sites around the impurity. We also found the\ndoping dependence for the induced magnetic moment consistent with experiments.\nPACS number: 74.72.-h\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fRecently a number of experiments, the neutron scattering1 , nuclear-magnetic-resonance\n(NMR)2,3 and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)4\u20136 , have been carried out to study\nthe impurity effect on the electronic transport and magnetic properties in high Tc cuprate\ncompounds. These studies provide a detail information about the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in high Tc cuprates. The nonmagnetic impurity Zn was found\nto suppress Tc more strongly than magnetic impurity Ni, even though both replace Cu in the\nCuO2 plane7 . The amazingly accurate measurement of the local density of states (LDOS)\nby STM4\u20136 also provides very different spectra for Zn and Ni. The spin dynamics studied by\nthe neutron scattering experiments reveals that the low-energy spin fluctuations are strongly\nenhanced near the impurity and the magnetic excitation at the antiferromagnetic wave vector (\u03c0, \u03c0) disappears with Zn doping in the underdoped region8,9 . It is interesting to find\nfrom the NMR and SQUID experiments that both the nonmagnetic Zn and the magnetic Ni\nimpurities induce a local magnetic moment on Cu sites surrounding the impurity in the normal state. The broadening of 63 Cu and 17 O NMR lines has been attributed to a distribution\nof magnetic moments or a spatially inhomogeneous spin polarization extending over several\nlattice sites around the impurity. On the other hand some experiments10 found no evidences\nof the existence of local magnetic moments, at least in the optimum and overdoped samples.\nMore careful theoretical and experimental efforts to exmine the magnetic polarization are\nneeded to clarify this issue.\nSo far most of the theoretical work has been based upon phenomenological BCS type\nmodels with emphasis on understanding of the LDOS. The observed nearly-zero-energyresonance peak near Zn impurity was explained very early by Balatsky, Salkola and coworkers11\u201314 by assuming Zn to be an unitary impurity. Studies15\u201320 based upon t \u2212 J type\nmodels have also successfully explained the LDOS. There are only few studies18 about the\nstructure of magnetic polarization induced by the magnetic moment binded to the nonmagnetic impurity and the screening of this moment by other electrons. However in a recent\npaper21 Tsuchiura et al. use Gutzwiller approximation and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)\napproach for the t \u2212 J model and they find no evidence of the existence of the local moments\n2\n\n\faround the Zn impurity. They also concluded that the electron avoids the impurity instead\nof being binded to it. A much more careful examination of the effect of a non-mgnetic\nimpurity in the t \u2212 J model is needed to resolve the controversy.\nComparing with other phenomenological models, the t \u2212 J model has much stronger\nmagnetic correlation and it may lead to a different picture about the magnetic polarization\naround the impurity. However, previous studies of the t-J model use the BdG approach with\nor without the Gutzwiller approximation and the no-doubly-occupied constraint imposed by\nthe t \u2212 J model is only taken into account on the average or approximately. It very likely\nunderestimates the antiferromagnetic correlation inherent in the t \u2212 J model. Another issue\nhas not been addressed adequately before is the doping dependence of the induced magnetic\nmoment. Very different results reported by NMR experiments2,7,10 may be related to the\ndoping dependence.\nIn this paper we will impose the constraint rigorously by using the variational Monte\nCarlo approach23 to study the effect of nonmagnetic Zn impurity on the ground state of\nthe t \u2212 J model. The ground state trial wave function is first constructed by assuming\nd-RVB order parameters in the BdG approach. Then the variational wave function is shown\nto be greatly improved by adding a Jastrow factor to account for the strong magnetic\ncorrelation. We found a large energy gain by having an antiferromagnetic polarization\naround the impurity with size about 4 to 5 lattice sites as observed in\n\n63\n\nCu NMR data2\n\nin the underdoped region. The significant suppression of the magnitude of the induced\nmoment and its polarization size as doping increases to optimum doping is also consistent\nwith experimental observations3,7 . In addition, our result also provides a reason to explain\nthe similarity between results3 measured for Li+ and Zn2+ . Contrary to the work reported\nin Ref.(21) we show that electrons are always attracted to the impurity. But the effect gets\nweaker when number of holes increases.\nThe model we consider is the dilute impurity limit of the two-dimensional t \u2212 J model.\nThe interaction between impurities is neglected. Zn2+ [3d10 ] has total spin S = 0 and its\nsecond ionization energy is about 18eV . Near chemical potential the conduction electron is\n3\n\n\festimated to encounter a repulsive local potential U0 \u2248 18.9eV 24 when it scatters with the\nZn impurity. This is much larger than the bandwidth (2eV ) of the dx2 \u2212y2 band of 3d Cu2+\nelectrons. Thus, the nonmagnetic impurity Zn can be described roughly by a spin vacancy\nin the unitary limit. We start from the Hamiltonian,\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n\nPG (c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c.)PG + J\n\n<ij>,\u03c3\n\nX\n1\n(Si * Sj \u2212 ni nj ) + (U0 \u03b4i,I \u2212 \u03bc)ni\u03c3 ,\n4\n<ij>\ni\nX\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I labels the site of the impurity. In the standard notation, the < ij > means the\ni (1\n\nsummation over nearest neighbors and PG =\n\nQ\n\n\u2212 ni\u2191 ni\u2193 ) is the Gutzwiller's projection\n\noperator that prohibits double occupancy.

The order parameters \u2206ij near the impurity are suppressed and a small component\nof s-wave pairing is induced. In the slave-boson mean field theory,22 the magnetic correlation obtained is overestimated. The simplest way to correct this deficiency is to use the\neigenvectors obtained by BdG equations to construct a variational wave function with the\nprojection operators rigorously imposed. For the uniform case23 a similar method has been\nused successfully.\nFollowing the work by Yokoyama and Shiba25 and Himeda et al.26 , we write this trial\nwave function for the ground state in terms of a Slater determinant of Ne /2 dimension,\n|\u03c6 >= PG (\n\nX\n\n(U \u22121 V )ij c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020j\u2193 )Ne /2 |0 >,\n\n(8)\n\nij\n\nm\nwhere U and V in Eq.(8) are the matrices of um\ni and vj , respectively. Without the Gutzwiller\n\nprojection operator, this wave function is exactly the same as BdG ground state but with\nfixed Ne electrons. The relation of this wave function with superconductivity in the absence\nof impurity was discussed in Refs.(22,24). Most properties calculated with or without the\nGutzwiller projection operator are quite similar as shown by Zhang et al.27 . However, the\nspin-spin correlation calculated by BdG (Eq.(2)) is very much smaller than by Eq.(8).\nIt should be noted that the trial wave function in Eq.(8) is a paramagnetic RVB state\nwithout the antiferromagnetic long range order (AF LRO). In a uniform system without\nimpurity at low doping, \u03b4 < 0.06, this state is unstable28 with respect to the AF LRO. To take\ninto account AF LRO, we could either add a Jastrow factor28 , such as exp(\u2212hu\n\nP\n\ni (\u22121)\n\ni\n\nSzi ),\n\nto modify the trial wave function or we could include spin density wave order parameter29,30\nto the original BdG equations. Since both approaches obtain almost identical results, we\nshall use a Jastrow factor here.\nIn addition to the issue of AF LRO at low doping, we are also concerned with the\nlack of consideration of strong correlation in the mean field theory of BdG equations.\nUse of Gutzwiller approximation21 in BdG would improve but it still may not be enough.\n5\n\n\fWhen the no-double-occupancy constraint is included exactly, we could examine the issue of\nattraction21 or repulsion16\u201318 of holes by the impurity more accurately. Hence we introduce\na Jastrow factor to reflect the influence of the impurity on the near-by hole distribution and\nmagnetic polarization. This new trial wave function is\n|\u03c8I >= exp (\u2212\n\nX\n\n((\u22121)i hi Siz +\n\ni\n\nwhere Ri =\n\n\u03bb(1 \u2212 ni )\n))|\u03c6 >,\nRi\n\n(9)\n\nq\n\n(xi \u2212 xI )2 + (yi \u2212 yI )2 is the distance from the impurity site denoted by I.\n\nThe first term in the exponent in Eq.(9) introduces a spatial dependent staggered magnetic\nfield, which consists of two terms, hi = hu +\n\nh0\n.\nRi\n\nhu provides a uniform AF LRO at low\n\ndoping with or without the impurity. h0 is used to describe the enhanced AF correlation\neffect around the impurity. This enhancement will repel holes away from the impurity.\nHence we include the second term associated with \u03bb for this repulsion. Notice that if \u03bb is\nnegative, then the hole is attracted to the impurity and the electron is repelled from it. The\nvalues of hu , h0 and \u03bb are determined by minimizing the variational energy. In Eq.(9) we\nhave chosen\n\n1\nR\n\nform to simulate the extent of the spin polarization around the impurity. We\n\nhave examined several other functional forms and results are about the same as long as it\ncovers a substantial region around the impurity. Below we will report mostly the results\nobtained from |\u03c8I > with\n\n1\nR\n\nform. Then we will also show that similar results are obtained\n\nwith a different trial function |\u03c8I\u2032 > using\n\n1\nR2\n\nform. The latter has been previously shown\n\nby G. Khaliullin et al.18 to be the spatial distribution of the impurity-induced moment.\nOur attention is also focued on the spatial magnetic polarization near the impurity.\nWithout loss of generality the impurity is supposed to be situated at the center of the\nlattice. Thus, we can use the periodic boundary condition for the numerical calculation.\nFor the 8x8, 12x12 and 16x16 lattice sizes we find that the spin cloud induced by the\nimpurity extends only several lattice sites and all the quantities we are concerned with,\nincluding the local magnetization and the spin-spin corrlation function, have no qualitative\nand significant changes with the change of the lattice size. This is because the lattice sizes\nwe used are large enough for the polarized spin cloud. Here we present the numerical results\n6\n\n\fobtained for a 12 \u00d7 12 lattice in the zero temperature limit with t/J = 3 and U0 = 100J.\nIn this paper J is our basic energy unit. We solve self-consistently the BdG equations\nand obtain the order parameters \u03c7ij , \u2206ij and the BdG amplitudes U and V . The pairing\norder parameters \u2206ij can be decomposed into extended s-wave and d-wave components as\n\u2206d (i) = 14 (\u2206x (i) + \u2206\u2212x (i) \u2212\u2206y (i) \u2212\u2206\u2212y (i)) and \u2206s (i) = 41 (\u2206x (i) + \u2206\u2212x (i) + \u2206y (i) + \u2206\u2212y (i)).\nThe d-wave component is suppressed around the impurity site and it induces a small swave pairing component which is consistent with other group's results20,31 . In principle, the\nJastrow factor introduced could modify the distribution of the order parameters. In practice,\ntuning the values of the order parameters around the solutions of the self-consistent BdG\nequations has little effect on the physical quantities discussed below, except a slightly lower\nground state energy is obtained. After obtaining the BdG solution and matrices U and\nV , we carry out the VMC simulation to determine the optimized ground state energy. 105\nsamples were used in each MC simulation to measure the physical quantities. Since there\nare three variational parameters: hu , h0 and \u03bb, the calculation to find the optimal solution is\nquite involved. Here we only report the main results. In Fig.1 we show energy per site as a\nfunction of \u03bb for two doping concentrations. In Fig.1(a) for doping concentration \u03b4 = 0.055\nand hu = 0.05, results for h0 = 0.2 (solid circles) and h0 = 0 (open cirlces) are compared.\nFig.1(b) shows that the lowest energy for \u03b4 = 0.152 is achieved for hu = 0.0, h0 = 0.0 and\n\u03bb = 0.2. It is noted that the energy is quite sensitive to the value of \u03bb. The lowest energy is\nacquired for positive \u03bb, thus the hole is repelled away from the impurity while the moment\nis binded to the impurity.\nWe compare the optimal ground-state energy per site calculated from the trial wave\nfunctions |\u03c6 > and |\u03c8I > in Table I. In the third row we also list the total energy difference\n(\u2206E) between these two wave functions. The variational parameters for the optimized wave\nfunction are listed in the table II.\nTable I: Optimal groud state energy per site as a function of hole density for two trial wave\nfunctions:|\u03c6 > and |\u03c8I >.

Although the energy per site has been improved only by a very small\namount, the total energy gain is greater than 0.7J. This is a very large energy gain due\nto the influence of a single impurity. It also clearly demonstrates that BdG approach has\nsignificantly underestimated the magnetic correlation surrounding the impurity.\nTable II shows that hu is zero, i.e. there is no AF LRO for doping greater than 0.08\nwith or without the impurity. This is expected as a single impurity cannot induce LRO for\nthe whole system. At the underdoped region, for \u03b4 = 0.083 \u223c 0.11, although there is no\nuniform AF LRO, the spins around the impurity tend to form a local AF cloud as reflected\nby the nonvanishing parameter h0 . It should be cautioned that in this case our trial function\n|\u03c8I > has broken the spin up-down symmetry. A more accurate description of this state\nshould be a state with a fluctuating local AF polarization but without fixing the moment\n\n8\n\n\fin a particular direction. For \u03b4 \u2265 0.139 although h0 = 0 and there is no apparent magnetic\npolarization around the impurity, the holes are still repelled from the impurity. This result\ndisagrees with the result reported by Tsuchiura et al.21 .\nTo examine the magnetic polarization induced around the impurity more closely, we have\ncalculated the difference of the local magnetization < Sz (R) > and the spin-spin correlation\nfunction < Sz (n)Sz (n + R) > between systems with and without impurity. Both results are\nplotted in Fig.2 as a function of the square of the distance from the impurity for several\ndopant densities. (\u22121)R (< Sz (R) > \u2212 < Sz (R) >0 ) shown in Fig.2(a) indicates that\n< Sz (R) > is enhanced near the impurity. < .. >0 is for the clean system without impurity.\nFor \u03b4 \u2265 0.083 there is no AF LRO and the induced magnetization only exists within a few\nlattice constants around the impurity. In Fig. 2(b) we show that the spin-spin correlation\nis also enhanced near the impurity. Site n is one of the nearest neighbors of the impurity.\nAgain the enhancement is weaker when the doping increases. This is consistent with the\nexperimental observation.\nIn Fig. (3) we plot the impurity induced spin and charge profiles, \u2206S 2 =< Si2 > \u2212 <\nSi2 >0 , and \u2206Nh =< Nih > \u2212 < Nih >0 respectively, for two different dopant concentrations.\nHere Nih = 1 \u2212 ni\u03c3 \u2212 ni\u2212\u03c3 . It can be seen that the holes are kept away from the impurity\nand a spin cloud is formed around the impurity. As the hole doping increases the spin cloud\nbecomes smaller in size.\nTo estimate the size of the induced magnetic polarization and the induced moment, we\ncalculate M(R) = 3g <\n\nq P\nNR\n\n(\n\ni\n\n(\u22121)i Siz )2 >, where the Lande g factor g = 2 and NR is\n\nthe number of sites within radius R of the impurity. The difference between the induced\nmagnetization with and without impurity, M(R) \u2212 M0 (R), is plotted as a function of R2\nin Fig.4. Results obtained by using |\u03c6 > and |\u03c8I > are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b),\nrespectively. In the inset of Fig. 4(b), results for \u03b4 = 0.111, 0.139 and 0.152 are shown with\na different scale. The saturation of values of M(R) \u2212 M0 (R) at large R indicates that the\ninduced magnetization has a finite extent. We shall define the size of the induced magnetic\npolarization to be Rc . At R = Rc M(R) \u2212 M0 (R) reaches about 70% of its saturated values.\n9\n\n\fThis moment is much larger for |\u03c8I > than for |\u03c6 >. Hence the local staggered magnetic\nfield, hi , and the repulsion between impurity and hole introduced by the Jastrow factor in\nEq. (9) has enhanced the induced moment.\nIn Fig. 4(b) we have used hi = hu +\n\nh0\nRi\n\nand\n\n1\nR\n\nfor the repulsion between hole and\n\nimpurity in Eq.(9) for |\u03c8I >. To examine the sensitivity of the result to the choice of the\nR dependence, we change\n\n1\nR\n\nto\n\n1\nR2\n\nfor both hi and the repulsion term in the Jastrow factor.\n\nThe optimized variational energies are almost the same as the results reported in Table I.\nThe results for the induced magnetic polarization is plotted in Fig. 4(c) which are quite\nsimilar to Fig. 4(b).\nResults in Fig.(4) show that the in the AF LRO states or \u03b4 \u2264 0.083, the induced magnetization is much larger. When there is no LRO the induced magnetization decreases rapidly\nwith increasing hole concentraion. This is consistent with experiments10 . It is also consistent\nwith the theoretical result reported by Tsuchiura et al.21 . But we do not agree with their\nconclusion that the holes are attracted toward the impurity. On the contrary, we have shown\nabove that the holes are repelled away from the impurity to lower their kinetic energy. This\neffect might give an explanation to the similarity3 between Li+ and Zn2+ . The holes are also\nrepelled away from the Li to gain energy.\nThe induced moment M = (M(Rc ) \u2212 M0 (Rc ))/NRc and the square of the size of the\ninduced cloud, Rc2 are plotted as a function of hole concentration in Fig. 5 and its inset,\nrespectively. For the hole concentration \u03b4 \u2264 0.055, the local magnetic moment we obtained is\nabout 0.5\u03bcB as compared with the experimental value 0.4 \u223c 1 \u03bcB for the Zn 4% substitution\nand different dopings. The rapid decrease of the size of the induced spin cloud could be due\nto the screening by the conducting carriers17,3 .\nIn summary, the magnetic polarization induced by nonmagnetic impurities in high Tc\ncuprate compounds is studied by combining the variational Monte Carlo simulation and\nBogoliubov de Gennes mean field Hamiltonian for the two-dimensional t \u2212 J model. A\nJastrow factor is introduced to account for the induced magnetic moment and the repulsion\nbetween holes and the impurity. A substantial energy gain is obtained when the holes are\n10\n\n\frepelled and the antiferromagnetic polarization is enhanced near the impurity. The doping\ndependence for the induced magnetic moment is consistent with experiments.\nThe author Liang would like to thank C.S Ting, J.X. Zhu, J.X. Li, and Chi-Ho Cheng\nfor helpful discussions.
