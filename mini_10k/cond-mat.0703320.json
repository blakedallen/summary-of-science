A common feature of soft matter is a presence of mesoscopic length scales, which is,\nin many respects, responsible for their unique properties such as the high susceptibility. For dilute polymer solutions (with each chain made of N0 succession of\nmonomers of size b), this corresponds to the Flory radius\nR0 = bN0\u03bd of individual coils, which serves as a basis\nfor the scaling theory [1]. From the estimation of the\nelastic modulus \u223c kB T /R03 , one can realize an important\nconsequence that a long chain is readily exposed to significant distortions, such as stretching and compression,\nby rather weak perturbations.\nAlthough the extension of a polymer in various flow\nfields or by mechanical stretching have been extensively\nstudied [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], most attentions so far have\nbeen focused on equilibrium or steady state properties.\nOne can also ask the dynamical process from one steady\nstate to the other induced by sudden change of external\nfield [7], which would be important in relation to recent\ndevelopment of micromanipulation techniques. For instance, imagine that an initially relaxed polymer is suddenly started to be pulled by its one end (see Appendex C). If the force is sufficiently weak f \u0303R0 < 1, a chain\nas a whole follows at the average velocity v \u2243 f /(\u03b7s R0 )\n(\u03b7s is the solvent viscosity) with keeping the equilibrium\nconformation. (Here and in what follows, we denote the\ndimensionless force f \u0303x \u2261 f x/(kB T ), where x has the dimension of the length.) For large force f \u0303R0 > 1, however, only a part of the chain can respond immediately,\nwhile remaining rear part does not feel the force yet. As\ntime goes on, the tension propagates along the chain,\nwhich alters chain conformation progressively, and the\nsteady state is reached after a characteristic time. At\nroom temperature, the critical force f \u223c (kB T )/R0 is estimated to be on the order of pico Newton for a flexible\nchain with N = 100 \u223c 1000, comparable to the usual\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: sakaue@scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\nforce range in the single molecule manipulation experiments with atomic force microscopy and optical tweezer.\nThe force generated by molecular motors also falls into\nthis range. This implies a possible importance of such\na nonequilibrium response in many biological as well as\ntechnological situations.\nIn the present paper, we illustrate such a nonequilibrium response using an example of polymer absorption or\naspiration into a small spot. Our target here is the dynamical process, in which a polymer is sucked into a localized hole. This is different from the pulling the chain's\none end [8], but similar in the way how the chain responds\nto the local force, and, in fact, relevant to the dynamics\nof polymer translocation through hole [9, 10] and the adsorption process to a small particle. (In this case, the\nforce f is related to the chemical potential change \u2206\u03bc\ndue to the absorption via f = \u2206\u03bc/b.) Although the phenomenon of polymer translocation has been an active research topic in the past decade as a model for biopolymer\ntransport through a pore in membrane, our current understanding for the dynamics, in particular the strongly\ndriven case, is restrictive. So far, the scaling estimates\nof the characteristic time \u03c4 for absorption process in immobile solvents have been proposed [8, 11]. Grosberg et.\nal. argued the absorption time for a Rouse chain on the\nground that Rouse time \u03c4R = \u03c40 N02 is the solitary relevant time scale (\u03c40 \u2243 \u03b7s b3 /(kB T ) is a microscopic time\nscale), and all other relevant parameters appear in the\ndimensionless combination f \u0303R0 , thus,\n\u03c4 = \u03c4R \u03c6(f \u0303R0 )\n\n(1)\n\nThe scaling function \u03c6 is determined from the requirement that the speed of the process, N0 /\u03c4 must be linear\nin the applied force, leading to\n\u03c4=\n\n\u03b7s b2 3/2\nN0\nf\n\n(2)\n\nThis result was interpreted as a sequential straightening\nof \"folds\" [11]. For a chain with excluded volume studied\nby Kantor and Karder, a similar scaling argument leads\nto [8]\n\u03c4 \u223c N01+\u03bd /f\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nwhere Flory exponent \u03bd = 1/2 for a chain in \u03b8 solvent,\nwhile in good solvent \u03bd \u2243 3/5 (in space dimension D = 3)\nand \u03bd = 3/4 (in D = 2).\nWe tackle this problem through different approach by\nexplicitly considering the dynamics of the tension propagation. This enables us to unveils the physics behind the\nnonequilibrium driven absorption and go beyond the previous works by taking the excluded volume effect and/or\nhydrodynamics interactions into account. We indeed find\nthat eq. (2), (3) are not generally correct as a consequence of the salient feature of flexible chain that the response to the aspiration or stretching force is nonuniform\nboth in space and time. At very strong driving, the chain\nfinite extensibility matters, and this leads us to propose\nthree distinguished regimes for the absorption process depending on the degree of forcing. Interestingly, we shall\nsee that eq. (2), (3) are recovered in the limit of very\nstrong forcing only. In addition to the absorption time,\nwe can also predict the time evolutions of dynamical variables governing this nonequilibrium process. Below, the\nproblem of the dynamical response is formulated with\nbasic equations and the absorption dynamics is analyzed\nin Sec. II A. Then, Sec. II B and II C are devoted to discussions on the effect of the finite chain extensibility and\nhydrodynamic interactions, respectively. Summary and\nfuture perspectives are given in Sec. III. Some technical\ndetails and mathematics are given in Appendix A and B.\nAnother example of nonequilibrium response, i.e., a sudden pulling of a chain by its one end, is briefly discussed\nin Appendix C.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nFORMULATION\n\nDynamical response to strong forcing\n\nNow, let us imagine the moment, when one end of the\nchain arrives at the attractive hole at the origin (Fig. 1).\nThe fact that the first monomer is strongly pulled influences the rear vicinity immediately, but not far away.\nIf we notice the subunit consisted of first g0 monomers\nof size y0 = bg0\u03bd , this subunit starts to move with the\naverage velocity v0 \u2243 f /(\u03b7s y0 ), provided that the deformation is insignificant in this scale. The size of such a\nsubunit is deduced by comparing the longest relaxation\ntime of the subunit \u03c40 g03\u03bd to the velocity gradient v0 /y0\ng0 \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\nkB T\nfb\n\n\u00131/\u03bd\n\n\u21d0\u21d2 y0 \u2243\n\nkB T\nf\n\n(4)\n\nand this constitutes the initial condition.\nThe absorption process proceeds with time; at time\nt, the tension is transmitted up to N (t)-th monomer,\nwhile M (t) front monomers are already absorbed (Fig.\n1). This indicates that one can regard that the chain\nportion at (\u2212R(t) < x < 0) takes a steady state conformation moving with the average velocity v(t). Here the\ndrag force builds up along the chain starting from a free\n\nFIG. 1: A dynamical response of a polymer initially at rest\nto the strong aspiration. A chain is pulled from (x < 0) region to the aspiration spot located at the origin. Monomers\nin gray region are under the influence of the tensile force,\nwhile monomers in the rear part is yet relaxed. The distance\nbetween the boundary (associated with tension propagation)\nand the origin and the size of the largest blob at the boundary are denoted as R(t) and yR (t), respectively. Monomers\nare sequentially labelled as 1, 2, * * * N0 from one end (arriving\nat the origin initially) to the other.

It\nmeans that the length scale y(x) set by the large tensile\nforce, above which the chain is substantially elongated,\nis position dependent, thus, the elastic behaviour of the\nchain is described as a sequence of blobs with growing\nsize y(x) = bg(x)\u03bd .

It is noted that eq. (21)\ncoincides with eq. (2) and (3).\nFor the intermediate case of 1 < f \u0303b < N0\u03bd , this process\nof strong pulling limit is valid until the time \u03c41\u2217 .

For the latter\npart, we can apply the aforementioned analysis for the\ntrumpet, where the \"boundary condition\" is imposed not\nat the origin but at x = l(t).

(4), the chain close\nto the origin is completely stretched (see the bottom of\nFig. 1). To include such an effect, let us begin with the\nlimit of strong force (f \u0303b > N0\u03bd )[17]. Then, at any moment, the entropic coiling is completely irrelevant for the\ntensed part of the chain. We can repeat the same argument by setting y(x) = b for (\u2212R(t) < x < 0), and\nfind\n\n(24)\n\n1\u22123\u03bd\n2\u03bd\n\n\u03a6\u2217 (R0 )\n\n(29)\n\nAbsorption time is approximated by the time \u03c41 when\nthe tension reaches the other end, thus, from eq.

Then, a question arises; what\nis the effect of the hydrodynamics in this dynamical process? To answer this, let us \"switch off\" the induced\nflow of solvents. Then, the only requisite alteration is\nthe dissipation mechanism, which becomes local and independent of the chain conformation. The local force\nbalance is, instead of eq. (5), written as\nZ x\ng(x\u2032 )\nkB T\n\u2243 \u03b7s bv(t)\ndx\u2032\n(31)\ny(x)\ny(x\u2032 )\n\u2212R(t)\nwhere g(x) is related to y(x) through y(x) = bg(x)\u03bd .

In partucular, \u03c41 for the moderate forcing\n(f \u0303b < 1) is obtained as\n2\n\n\u03c41 = \u03c4R (f \u0303R0 )\u2212 1+\u03bd \u03a6R (R0 )\n\n(33)\n\nwith\n\u03bd\u22121\n\n\u03a6R (x) \u2261 1 \u2212 B0 (f \u0303x ) \u03bd(\u03bd+1) + (B0 \u2212 1)(f \u0303x )\u2212\n\u2243 1 \u2212 B0 (f \u0303x )\n\na pore. We should note, however, in the problem of\nbiopolymer transport through a membrane pore, the role\nof specific interactions may become essentially important [9, 10, 13]. We neglect all the complications associated with such a factor and focused on universal aspects\nas a consequence of a polymeric nature, in this sense, the\npresent analysis may be regarded as an \"ideal\" version in\nview of the relation with the problem of polymer translocation. Such an \"ideal\" situation would be now experimentally feasible thanks to the advance in nanoscale fabrications [14].\nThe advantage of the present framework is rather wide\nrange of applicability to related problems. As mentioned\nin Sec. I, if the chain is suddenly pulled its one end, the\nresponse is nonuniform both in space and time. The resultant transient dynamics of the chain extension can be\nanalyzed in a similar way (see Appendex C). The same\nphysics is also expected in the escape process of a confined polymer from a planner slit [15]. Considering hierarchical structures common in polymeric systems, such\nnonequilibrium dynamics in a single chain level would be\nexpected to show up in macroscopic material properties,\ntoo. We hope that the present study provides the basic\ninsight involved in the driven nonequilibrium process of\npolymer absorption and its related problems and future\ninvestigations including the comparison with the numerical [18] and even real experiments would be valuable.\n\n2\u03bd 2 +\u03bd+1\n\u03bd(\u03bd+1)\n\n\u03bd\u22121\n\u03bd(\u03bd+1)\n\n(34)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n(35)\n\nwhich coincides with the scaling form of eq. (1) and\nshould be contrasted with eq. (14) with hydrodynamic\ninteractions. On the other hand, the result in the limit\nof the strong forcing (f \u0303b > N0\u03bd ) is not altered, and \u03c41 is\ngiven by eq. (21). It is in this limit only that the requirement \u03c4 \u223c f \u22121 is fulfilled reflecting the saturation of chain\ndeformation due to the complete stretching, therefore,\nthe earlier conjectures are approved [8, 11]. For smaller\nforces, the soft elasticity of the chain results in more involved responses as we have seen; the stronger driving\nresults in the more intense chain deformation, and this\ndeformation behaviour affects the absorption dynamics.\n\nI wish to thank T. Ohta for fruitful discussions.

We define h(x) = \u03c1(x)S(x) and h(x)dx =\nH(x) for the concise notation. Then, the integral form\nof the mass conservation (eq. (7)) is written as\nH(0) \u2212 H(\u2212R(t)) + M (t) = N (t)\n\nIII.\n\n(A1)\n\nSUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nThere would be many practical situations, in which\nthe externally imposed velocity gradient exceeds the inverse relaxation time of long polymers. If the external\nfield acts locally, effects associated with nonequilibrium\nresponse, i.e., the propagation of the tensile force along\nthe chain, are expected to show up. We focused on the\nproblem of absorption or aspiration into a localized hole\nand demonstrated how such a process can be physically\ndescribed.\nOne of the most relevant situations of aspiration dynamics studied here is the polymer translocation through\n\nThe variation of this equation with the variable transformation from x to u = x \u2212 v(t)t leads to\ndH\n\u21d4\n\nu=\u2212v(t)t\n\n\u2212 dH\n\nu=\u2212R(t)\u2212v(t)t\n\n+ dM (t) = dN (t) (A2)\n\nh(0) \u00d7 [\u2212vdt] \u2212 h(\u2212R(t)) \u00d7 [d(\u2212R(t)) \u2212 v(t)dt] + dM (t)\ndN\n=\ndR(t)\n(A3)\ndR\n\nSince h(0) \u00d7 v(t)dt is the number of absorbed monomer\nduring the time interval dt, the first and the last terms in\nleft hand side are canceled out. The resultant equation is\nthe differential form of the mass conservation (eq.

Equations (27) and (30) in the case of strong\npulling (1 < f \u0303b < N0\u03bd ) are obtained in the same way just\nby replacing the lower limit of the integral in eq. (B3)\nwith l(t) (eq.

A coordinate is defined in such a way that the origin is the position\nof one chain end at time t = 0 and that end is started to be\npulled to right (x > 0) direction. Monomers in gray region\nare under the influence of the tensile force, while monomers in\nthe rear part is yet relaxed. The distance between the boundary (front of the tension propagation) and the origin and the\nsize of the largest blob at the boundary are denoted as R(t)\nand yR (t), respectively. Monomers are sequentially labelled\nas 1, 2, * * * N0 from the pulled end to the other. N (t) is the\nlabel of the monomer residing at the boundary at time t.\n\nspace and the chain portion after crossing this point gets\nrelaxed, while in the latter case, the site of action is\nmoving with the velocity v(t) = dl(t)/dt and the chain\nportion after crossing the origin is still tensed and contributes the friction.\nIn this case, too, one can distinguish three different\nregimes depending on the applied force; (i) trumpet\n(f \u0303b < 1 < f \u0303R0 ), (ii) intermediate (1 < f \u0303b < N0 ) and\n(iii) strong limit with complete stretching (f \u0303b > N0 ) by\nmonitoring the force acting on the last monomer at the\nfree boundary (Note that the border between regime (ii)\nand (iii) is different from the absorption case).

Then, by\nsubstituting the velocity v(t) \u2243 f /(\u03b7s L(t)) into eq. (15),\none obtains eq. (17) .\n[17] This limit was briefly discussed by D. Lubensky in a chapter of ref. [9].\n[18] Simulation studies so far were conducted with large force\nand numerical data with weaker forcing (f \u0303b < 1) seems\n\n\f8\nto be currently unavailable. Therefore, seeking for distinguishable regimes depending on the magnitude of the\nforce as well as the effect of hydrodynamic interactions remain to be seen. A care should be taken for modelling the\nchain connectivity to ensure the finite chain extensibil-\n\nity, otherwise the backbone of the model chain would be\noverstretched and becomes unrealistic under large forcing\n(f \u0303b > 1).\n\n\f"}
