We prove this result using two different approaches to\ninvertible complete Segal spaces and Segal groupoids.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe notion of homotopy theories as mathematical objects is becoming a useful\ntool in topology as more mathematical structures are being viewed from a homotopical or higher-categorical viewpoint. Currently, there are four known models for\nhomotopy theories: simplicial categories, Segal categories, complete Segal spaces,\nand quasi-categories. There are corresponding model category structures for each;\nthe first three were shown to be Quillen equivalent to each other by the author [7],\nand the fourth was shown to be equivalent to the first by Joyal [19]; explicit equivalences between the fourth and the other two are also given by Joyal and Tierney\n[21]. Each of these models has proved to be useful in different contexts. Simplicial\ncategories are naturally models for homotopy theories, in that they arise naturally\nfrom model categories, or more generally from categories with weak equivalences,\nvia Dwyer and Kan's simplicial localization techniques [11], [13]. For this reason,\none important motivation for studying any of these models is to understand specific\nhomotopy theories and relationships between them. Quasi-categories, on the other\nhand, are more clearly a generalization of categories and more suited to constructions that look like those appearing in category theory. In fact, both Joyal [20] and\nLurie [22] have written extensively on extending category theory to quasi-category\ntheory. The objects in all four models are often called (\u221e, 1)-categories, to indicate\nthat they can be regarded as categories with n-morphisms for any n \u2265 1, but for\nwhich these n-morphisms are all invertible whenever n > 1.\nIn this current paper, we would like to show that the first three models can\nbe restricted to the groupoid case without much difficulty. Such structures could\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 55U35, 18G30, 18E35.\nKey words and phrases. homotopy theories, simplicial categories, simplicial groupoids, complete Segal spaces, Segal groupoids, model categories, (\u221e, 1)-categories and groupoids.\nSupport from the Fields Institute for a visit in May 2007, when much of the work for this\npaper was completed, is gratefully acknowledged.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nbe called (\u221e, 1)-groupoids, but they are really (\u221e, 0)-categories, since even the 1morphisms are invertible in this case. In fact, we go on to prove that these model\nstructures are Quillen equivalent to the standard model structure on the category\nof simplicial sets (and therefore to the standard model structure on the category of\ntopological spaces). It has been proposed by a number of people, beginning with\nGrothendieck [16], that \u221e-groupoids, or (\u221e, 0)-categories, should be models for\nhomotopy types of spaces, so this result can be seen as further evidence for this\n\"homotopy hypothesis.\" Many authors have proved results in this area, including\nTamsamani [29], Berger [3], Cisinski [10], Paoli [24], Biedermann [8], and Barwick\n[2], and a nice overview is given by Baez [1].\nWe should further note here that this comparison actually encompasses an invertible version of the fourth model, that of quasi-categories, since a quasi-category\nwith inverses is just a Kan complex, and the fibrant objects in the standard model\ncategory structure on the category of simplicial sets are precisely the Kan complexes.\nOrganization of the Paper. In section 2, we give a new proof of the existence\nof a model structure on the category of simplicial groupoids. In sections 3 and 4,\nwe define invertible versions of complete Segal spaces and Segal categories using\nthe category I\u2206op rather than \u2206op as a means of encoding inverses. We prove\nthe existence of appropriate model category structures as well. In section 5, we\nprove that these simplicial groupoid, Segal groupoid, and invertible complete Segal\nspace model structures are Quillen equivalent to one another and to the standard\nmodel category structure on the category of simplicial sets. In section 6, we give\nan alternate approach to invertible versions of Segal categories and complete Segal\nspaces by changing the projection maps in the category \u2206op , and we again show that\nwe have a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between the resulting model categories.\nWe refer the reader to the previous paper [4] for our notations and conventions\nregarding simplicial objects and model categories.\nAcknowledgments. I would like to thank Andr\u00e9 Joyal and Simona Paoli for\ndiscussions on the material in this paper, as well as the referee for suggestions for\nits improvement.\n2. A model category structure on the category of simplicial\ngroupoids\nA simplicial category is a category C enriched over simplicial sets, or a category\nsuch that, for objects x and y of C, there is a simplicial set of morphisms MapC (x, y)\nbetween them.\nRecall that the category of components \u03c00 C of a simplicial category C is the\ncategory with the same objects as C and such that\nHom\u03c00 C (x, y) = \u03c00 MapC (x, y).\nWe use the following notion of equivalence of simplicial categories.\nDefinition 2.1. [11, 2.4] A functor f : C \u2192 D between two simplicial categories is\na Dwyer-Kan equivalence if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n\u2022 (W1) for any objects x and y of C, the induced map\nMapC (x, y) \u2192 MapD (f x, f y)\nis a weak equivalence of simplicial sets, and\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n3\n\n\u2022 (W2) the induced map of categories of components \u03c00 f : \u03c00 C \u2192 \u03c00 D is an\nequivalence of categories.\nDwyer and Kan proved in [12, 2.5] that there is a model structure on the category SGpd of small simplicial groupoids with the Dwyer-Kan equivalences as weak\nequivalences. In fact, they went on to show that this model structure has the additional structure of a simplicial model category, and that it is Quillen equivalent to\nthe usual model structure on the category SSets of simplicial sets. In this section,\nwe give an alternate proof of the existence of this model structure, following the\nproof for the model category of small simplicial categories [5].\nConsider the category SGpdO of simplicial groupoids with a fixed set O of objects. In particular, the morphisms in this category are required to be the identity\nmap on this set of objects. There is a model category structure on SGpdO in which\nthe weak equivalences are defined to be those simplicial functors f : C \u2192 D such\nthat for any objects x and y of C, the map\nMapC (x, y) \u2192 MapD (f x, f y)\nis a weak equivalence of simplicial sets. The fibrations are defined analogously [4].\nThis model category can also be shown to have the additional structure a simplicial\nmodel category, just as Dwyer and Kan show for the analogous model category SC O\nof small simplicial categories with a fixed object set [13, 7.1].\nTheorem 2.2. The category SGpd of small simplicial groupoids has a cofibrantly\ngenerated model category structure given by the following three classes of morphisms:\n(1) The weak equivalences are the Dwyer-Kan equivalences of simplicial groupoids.\n(2) The fibrations are the maps f : C \u2192 D such that\n\u2022 (F1) for any objects x and y of C, the map\nMapC (x, y) \u2192 MapD (f x, f y)\nis a fibration of simplicial sets, and\n\u2022 (F2) for any object x in C, z in D, and morphism g : f x \u2192 z in D0 ,\nthere is an object y in C and morphism d : x \u2192 y in C0 such that\nf d = g.\n(3) The cofibrations are the maps with the left lifting property with respect to\nthe maps which are both fibrations and weak equivalences.\nTo prove this theorem, we need to define candidates for our sets of generating\ncofibrations and generating acyclic cofibrations. To do so, we begin by defining the\nfunctor\nUG : SSets \u2192 SGpd\ntaking a simplicial set X to the simplicial groupoid with objects x and y and\nmapping spaces\nMap(x, y) = Map(y, x) = X\nand\nMap(x, x) = Map(y, y) = \u2206[0].\nIn other words, the mapping spaces Map(x, y) and Map(y, x) are inverse to one\nanother.\nUsing this functor, we define the set of generating cofibrations to consist of the\nmaps\n\n\f4\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\n \u0307\n\u2192 UG \u2206[n] for all n \u2265 1, and\n\u2022 (C1) UG \u2206[n]\n\u2022 (C2) \u2205 \u2192 {x}.\nSimilarly, we define the set of generating acyclic cofibrations to consist of the maps\n\u2022 (A1) UG V [n, k] \u2192 UG \u2206[n] for all n \u2265 1, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, and\n\u2022 (A2) {x} \u2192 F , where F is the groupoid with two objects x and y and with\nall the mapping spaces given by \u2206[0].\nNotice in particular that the set of generating acyclic cofibrations is substantially\nsmaller than the analogous set for the model structure on the category of simplicial\ncategories.\nProposition 2.3. A map f : C \u2192 D of simplicial groupoids has the right lifting\nproperty with respect to the maps in (A1) and (A2) if and only if it satisfies (F1)\nand (F2).\nProof. Using the standard model structure SSets on the category of simplicial sets,\nit is not hard to show that condition (F1) is equivalent to having the right lifting\nproperty with respect to the maps in (A1).\nThus, let us suppose that f has the right lifting property with respect to (A1)\nand (A2) and show that f satisfies (F2). In other words, given an object x of C and\nobject z of D, we need to show that a map g : f x \u2192 z in D lifts to a map d : x \u2192 y\nfor some object y of C such that f y = z and f d = g. Let us consider the objects\nw = f x and z in C.\nFirst suppose that w 6= z. Define E to be the full simplicial subcategory of D\nwith objects w and z. Let F be the simplicial category with two objects w and z\nand a single isomorphism h : w \u2192 z. Consider some map i : F \u2192 E which preserves\nthe objects. Note that the map {x} \u2192 F is precisely the map in (A2). Consider\nthe composite inclusion map F \u2192 E \u2192 D. These maps fit into a diagram\n// C\n4==\n\n{x}\n4\n\nf\n\n4\n\u000f\u000f 4\nF\n\n4\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// D.\n\nThe dotted arrow lift exists because we assume that f : C \u2192 D has the right lifting\nproperty with respect to the map in (A2). But, the existence of this lift implies\nthat any morphism in D, since it must be an isomorphism, lifts to a morphism in\nC.\nThen, suppose that w = z. Define E \u2032 to be the simplicial groupoid with two\nobjects w and w\u2032 such that each function complex of E \u2032 is the simplicial set\nMapD (w, w) and composites are defined as they are in D. We then define the\nmap E \u2032 \u2192 D which sends both objects of E \u2032 to w in D and is the identity map\non all the function complexes. Using this simplicial groupoid E \u2032 for the simplicial\ngroupoid E used above, the argument proceeds as before.\nNow suppose that f satisfies (F1) and (F2). We seek to show that f has the\nright lifting property with respect to the map (A2). In other words, we need to\nshow that the dotted arrow lift exists in the diagram\n// C\n4==\n\n{x}\n4\n4\n\u000f\u000f 4\nF\n\n4\n\nf\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// D.\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n5\n\nHowever, the existence of such a lift follows from the fact that the map f satisfies\nproperty (F2).\n\u0003\nThe proof of the following proposition follows just as the analogous statement\nfor simplicial categories [5, 3.1].\nProposition 2.4. The category SGpd has all small limits and colimits and its\nclass of weak equivalences is closed under retracts and satisfies the \"two out of\nthree\" property.\nNotice that, as for the case of SC, a map f : C \u2192 D satisfies both (F1) and (W1)\nif and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to the maps in (C1).\nHowever, we need the following stronger statement.\nProposition 2.5. A map in SGpd is a fibration and a weak equivalence if and only\nif it has the right lifting property with respect to the maps in (C1) and (C2).\nProof. First, we suppose that f : C \u2192 D is a fibration and a weak equivalence. As\nnoted above, it follows from the definitions that f has the right lifting property\nwith respect to the maps in (C1). Thus, it remains to show that f has the right\nlifting property with respect to the map (C2), i.e., with respect to the map \u2205 \u2192\n{x}. However, satisfying such a lifting property is equivalent to being surjective\non objects. The fact that f is essentially surjective, or surjective on isomorphism\nclasses of objects, follows from condition (W2). Given this property, the fact that\nf satisfies condition (F2) guarantees that it is actually surjective.\nConversely, suppose that f : C \u2192 D has the right lifting property with respect\nto the maps in (C1) and (C2). We need to show that f is a fibration and a weak\nequivalence. As noted above, it follows immediately from the definitions that f\nsatisfies conditions (F1) and (W1).\nThe fact that f satisfies (W1) implies that the map\nHom\u03c00 C (x, y) \u2192 Hom\u03c00 D (f x, f y)\nis an isomorphism of sets. Furthermore, the fact that f has the right lifting property with respect to the map in (C2) guarantees that f is surjective on objects.\nTherefore, the map \u03c00 f : \u03c00 C \u2192 \u03c00 D is an equivalence of categories; i.e., condition\n(W2) is satisfied.\nIt remains to show that f satisfies condition (F2). Since we have already proved\nthat f satisfies (F1) if and only if it has the right lifting property with respect\nto (A1), and that if f has the right lifting property with respect to (A1) and\n(A2), then it satisfies (F2), it suffices to show that f has the right lifting property\nwith respect to (A2). However, the map {x} \u2192 F in (A2) can be written as a\ncomposite of a pushout along \u2205 \u2192 {x} followed by pushouts along maps of the\n \u0307\n\u2192 UG \u2206[n] for n = 0, 1. But, f has the right lifting property with\nform UG \u2206[n]\nrespect to all such maps since they are in (C1) and (C2).\n\u0003\nProposition 2.6. A map in SGpd is an an acyclic cofibration if and only if it has\nthe left lifting property with respect to the fibrations.\nThe proof of this proposition can be proved formally, just as in the case of\nsimplicial categories [5, 3.3]. It does, however, require the following lemma, whose\nproof essentially follows the one for SC O in [13, 7.3].\nLemma 2.7. The model category SGpdO is proper.\n\n\f6\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nProof. We first prove that SGpdO is right proper, namely, that a pullback of a\nweak equivalence along a fibration is a weak equivalence. However, since fibrations\nand weak equivalences are defined in terms of fibrations and weak equivalences of\nmapping spaces, this fact follows from the right properness of SSets [17, 13.1.13].\nTo prove that SGpdO is left proper, we need to show that the pushout of a weak\nequivalence along a cofibration is a weak equivalence. Suppose that the following\ndiagram\nA\n\ni\n\n// X\n\ng\n\n\u000f\u000f\nB\n\nf\n\nj\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// Y\n\nis a pushout diagram with the map g a cofibration and i a weak equivalence. To\nprove that the map j is a weak equivalence, we can assume that the map g : A \u2192 B\nis a free map, since cofibrations are retracts of free maps [12, 2.4]. Furthermore, any\nfree map can be written as the colimit of a sequence of free maps for which all of\nthe nondegenerate generators are in the same dimension. So, suppose that C is an\nordinary groupoid, regarded as a simplicial groupoid, and let C \u2297 \u2206[n] denote the\nsimplicial groupoid given by the simplicial structure on SGpdO . Then, it suffices to\nshow that j is a weak equivalence in the diagram (made up of two pushout squares)\n \u0307\nC \u2297 \u2206[n]\n\n// A\n\n\u000f\u000f\nC \u2297 \u2206[n]\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// B\n\ni\n\ng\n\n// X\nf\n\nj\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// Y.\n\nThis result follows from technical results on pushouts in [13, \u00a78].\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 2.2. We need to verify the conditions of Theorem 2.1 of the previous paper [4]. The fact that M has small limits and colimits and that its weak\nequivalences satisfy the necessary conditions was proved in Proposition 2.4. Condition 1 follows from the same arguments as used for simplicial categories [5, 1.1].\nCondition 2 was proved in Proposition 2.3. Condition 3 was proved in Proposition\n2.5. Condition 4 was proved in Proposition 2.6.\n\u0003\nThe following proposition is proved similarly to the analogous result for simplicial\ncategories [5, 3.5].\nProposition 2.8. The model category SGpd is right proper.\nProof. Suppose that\nA\n\nf\n\n// B\ng\n\n\u000f\u000f\nC\n\nh\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// D\n\nis a pullback diagram of simplicial groupoids, where g : B \u2192 D is a fibration and\nh : C \u2192 D is a Dwyer-Kan equivalence. We would like to show that f : A \u2192 B is a\nDwyer-Kan equivalence as well.\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n7\n\nWe first need to show that MapA (x, y) \u2192 MapB (f x, f y) is a weak equivalence\nof simplicial sets for any objects x and y of A. However, this fact follows since the\nmodel category structure on simplicial sets is right proper [17, 13.1.4].\nIt remains to prove that \u03c00 A \u2192 \u03c00 B is an equivalence of categories. Given what\nwe have proved thus far, it suffices to show that A \u2192 B is essentially surjective on\nobjects.\nConsider an object b of B and its image g(b) in D. Since C \u2192 D is a Dwyer-Kan\nequivalence, there exists an object c of C together with an isomorphism g(b) \u223c\n= h(c)\nin D. Since B \u2192 D is a fibration, there exists an object b\u2032 and isomorphism b \u223c\n= b\u2032\n\u2032\nin B such that g(b ) = h(c). Using the fact that A is a pullback, we have an\nisomorphism b \u223c\n\u0003\n= f (b\u2032 , c), completing the proof.\n3. Invertible Segal spaces\nIn this section, we define \"groupoid versions\" of Rezk's Segal spaces and complete\nSegal spaces. To do so, we first summarize a few general facts using the category\nI\u2206op ; further details can be found in the previous paper [4, \u00a74]. We note that Rezk's\noriginal definition of (complete) Segal spaces can be recovered from the definitions\nin this section by replacing the category I\u2206op with the category \u2206op throughout.\nThe same holds for our definitions of Segal groupoids in the next section. We\ngive fewer details in this section and the following ones, compared to the previous\nsection, due to the fact that most of the proofs are not only similar but actually\nfollow just as in the original cases.\nIn the category I\u2206, there are maps \u03b2 i : I[1] \u2192 I[k] given by 0 7\u2192 i and 1 7\u2192\ni + 1. We denote the corresponding map in I\u2206op by \u03b2i : I[k] \u2192 I[1]. Each map\n\u03b2i induces an inclusion of invertible simplicial sets I\u2206[1] \u2192 I\u2206[n]. We thus define\nthe invertible simplicial space\nIG(k)t =\n\nk\u22121\n[\n\n\u03b2 i I\u2206[1]t\n\ni=0\n\nand the inclusion map\n\u03be k : IG(k)t \u2192 I\u2206[n]t\nFurthermore, this inclusion map induces, for any invertible simplicial space X, a\nmap\nMap(I\u2206[k]t , X) \u2192 Map(IG(k)t , X)\nwhich can be written as the Segal map\n\u03bek : Xk \u2192 X1 \u00d7X0 * * * \u00d7X0 X1 .\n{z\n}\n|\nk\n\n(This treatment should be compared to Rezk's in the non-invertible case [27, \u00a74].)\nUsing I\u2206op rather than \u2206op , we still have the injective and projective model\nop\nstructures on the category SSetsI\u2206 . These model structures can be defined via\nop\nthe inclusion maps I\u2206 \u2192 \u2206op . For the injective structure, then, the generating\ncofibrations are the maps\n \u0307\n \u0307 t \u2192 \u2206[m] \u00d7 I\u2206[n]t\n\u2206[m]\n\u00d7 I\u2206[n]t \u222a \u2206[m] \u00d7 I \u2206[n]\nfor all n, m \u2265 0. For the projective structure, the generating cofibrations are the\nmaps\n \u0307\n\u2206[m]\n\u00d7 I\u2206[n]t \u2192 \u2206[m] \u00d7 I\u2206[n]t\n\n\f8\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nfor all m, n \u2265 0.\nDefinition 3.1. An invertible Segal space is an injective fibrant invertible simplicial\nspace W such that the Segal maps \u03bek are weak equivalences of simplicial sets for\nk \u2265 2.\nDefine the map\n\u03be=\n\na\n\n(\u03be k : IG(k)t \u2192 I\u2206[k]t ).\n\nk\u22651\n\nTheorem 3.2. Localizing the injective model category structure on the category\nop\nSSetsI\u2206 of invertible simplicial spaces with respect to the map \u03be results in a\nmodel structure ISeSpc in which the fibrant objects are the invertible Segal spaces.\nWe can also define a model structure ISeSpf on the category of simplicial spaces\nby localizing the projective, rather than the injective, model structure with respect\nto the map \u03be. In this case the fibrant objects are invertible simplicial spaces fibrant\nin the projective model structure for which the Segal maps are isomorphisms.\nLike a Segal space, an invertible Segal space has a set of \"objects,\" given by the\nset W0,0 , and, for any pair (x, y) of objects, a \"mapping space\" mapW (x, y). This\nmapping space is defined to be the fiber over (x, y) of the map\nW1\n\nd1 \u00d7d0\n\n// W0 \u00d7 W0 .\n\nHowever, the fact that we are considering an invertible Segal space implies that\nthese mapping spaces have inverses, so that for any x and y objects in W , the simplicial sets mapW (x, y) and mapW (y, x) are isomorphic. Thus, all maps are homotopy\nequivalences and the space Whoequiv \u2286 W1 consisting of \"homotopy equivalences\"\n(as defined by Rezk for Segal spaces [27, \u00a75]) is in fact all of W1 for an invertible\nSegal space W . (It is helpful here to regard an invertible Segal space simply as a\nSegal space via the inclusion functor \u2206op \u2192 I\u2206op , in which case Rezk's definitions\ncan be used as is.)\nDefinition 3.3. An invertible complete Segal space is an invertible Segal space W\nsuch that the degeneracy map s0 : W0 \u2192 W1 is a weak equivalence of simplicial\nsets.\nNotice that in some sense this definition is silly, because an invertible complete\nSegal space is one for which W0 and W1 are weakly equivalent, and therefore, using\nthe definition of Segal space, each equivalent to Wn for each n \u2265 0. Thus, invertible\ncomplete Segal spaces are just, up to weak equivalence, constant simplicial spaces,\nand equivalent to simplicial sets. We prove this fact more explicitly in section 5.\nHowever, we can take the same map \u03c8 : \u2206[0]t \u2192 E t that Rezk used to obtain a\ncomplete Segal space model structure on the category of simplicial spaces to obtain\nan invertible complete Segal space model structure on the category of invertible\nsimplicial spaces. Here, E denotes the nerve of the category F with two objects\nand a single isomorphism between these two objects and no other nonidentity morphisms. The map \u03c8 is just the inclusion of one of these objects. The following\ntheorem can then be proved just as Rezk proves the analogous theorem for the\ncomplete Segal space model structure [27, 7.2]\nTheorem 3.4. There is a model structure ICSS on the category of invertible simplicial spaces such that the fibrant objects are the invertible complete Segal spaces.\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n9\n\n4. Segal groupoids\nTo define the notion of a Segal groupoid, we again use Segal maps in the context\nof invertible simplicial spaces. We first used this approach to them in [4], but the\nidea of a Segal groupoid has also been studied from a slightly different angle by\nSimpson [28] and Pellissier [25].\nDefinition 4.1. A Segal pregroupoid is an invertible simplicial space X such that\nthe simplicial set X0 is discrete.\nWe denote the category of Segal pregroupoids by SeGpd.\nRecall from the previous section that, given an invertible simplicial space X, the\nmaps \u03b2 k for k \u2265 2 induce the Segal maps\n\u03bek : Xk \u2192 X1 \u00d7X0 * * * \u00d7X0 X1 .\n{z\n}\n|\nk\n\nDefinition 4.2. A Segal groupoid is a Segal groupoid X such that the Segal maps\n\u03bek are weak equivalences of simplicial sets for all k \u2265 2.\nIn the previous paper, we proved that there model category structures on the\ncategory of Segal groupoids with a fixed object set O.\nProposition 4.3. [4, 4.1] There is a model category structure ISSpO,f on the\ncategory of Segal pregroupoids with a fixed set O in degree zero in which the weak\nequivalences and fibrations are given levelwise. Similarly, there is a model category structure ISSpO,c on the same underlying category in which the weak equivalences and cofibrations are given levelwise. Furthermore, we can localize each of\nthese model category structures with respect to a map to obtain model structures\nILSSpO,f and ILSSpO,c whose fibrant objects are Segal groupoids.\n(Recall here that the subscripts c and f are meant to suggest the injective and\nprojective model structures, with the respective letter indicating whether cofibrations or fibrations are given levelwise.)\nFurthermore, the following rigidification result holds in this fixed object set case.\nProposition 4.4. [4, 4.2] There is a Quillen equivalence between the model categories ILSSpO,f and SGpdO .\nWe conjectured in [4] that this result should still hold when we generalize to the\ncategory of all small simplicial groupoids and all Segal groupoids. Before proving\nthis result, we need to establish that we have the necessary model structures for\nSegal groupoids, i.e., model structures on the category of Segal pregroupoids in\nwhich the fibrant objects are Segal groupoids.\nThe first step in finding such model structures is modifying the generating cofiop\nop\nso that\nand SSetsI\u2206\nbrations and generating acyclic cofibrations of SSetsI\u2206\nc\nf\nthey are maps between Segal pregroupoids rather than maps between arbitrary\ninvertible simplicial spaces.\nop\nRecall that for SSetsI\u2206\n, a set of generating cofibrations is given by\nc\nt\n \u0307\n \u0307 t \u2192 \u2206[m] \u00d7 I\u2206[n]t | m, n \u2265 0}.\n{\u2206[n] \u00d7 I\u2206[n] \u222a \u2206[m] \u00d7 I \u2206[n]\nTo find the set that we need, we apply a reduction functor (\u2212)r which makes the\nspace in degree 0 discrete and then check potentially problematic values of n and\nm, as in [7, \u00a74]. Thus, we obtain the set Ic given by\nt\n \u0307\n \u0307 t )r \u2192 (\u2206[m]\u00d7I\u2206[n]t )r | m \u2265 0 when n \u2265 1, n = m = 0}\n{(\u2206[m]\u00d7I\u2206[n]\n\u222a\u2206[m]\u00d7I \u2206[n]\n\n\f10\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nas a potential set of generating cofibrations.\nop\nFor the modification of the generating cofibrations of SSetsI\u2206\n, we need to take\nf\na different approach. To do so, we make the following definitions. Let IPm,n be\nthe pushout in the diagram\n \u0307\n\u2206[m]\n\u00d7 (I\u2206[n]t )0\n\n// \u2206[m]\n \u0307\n\u00d7 I\u2206[n]t\n\n\u000f\u000f\n(I\u2206[n]t )0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// IPm,n .\n\n \u0307\nIf we replace \u2206[m]\nwith \u2206[m] in the above diagram, we denote the pushout IQm,n .\nWe then define a set of generating cofibrations for SeGpdf to be\nIf = {Im,n : IPm,n \u2192 IQm,n | m, n \u2265 0}.\nNow, to give the definitions of the desired weak equivalences for our model structures, we establish an appropriate \"localization\" functor. Since our model structures are not actually obtained by localizing another model structure, this functor\nis not technically a localization, but it is analogous to the fibrant replacement functor in ISeSpf , which is obtained from localization, and it does turn out to be a\nfibrant replacement functor in SeGpdf .\nFor the invertible Segal space model structure ISeSpc , a choice of generating\nacyclic cofibrations is the set\n{V [m, k] \u00d7 I\u2206[n]t \u222a \u2206[m] \u00d7 IG(n)t \u2192 \u2206[m] \u00d7 I\u2206[n]t | n \u2265 0, m \u2265 1, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m}.\nTo have these maps defined between Segal pregroupoids rather than between arbitrary invertible simplicial spaces, we restrict to the case where n \u2265 1. As in [7,\n\u00a75] it can be shown that taking an colimit of iterated pushouts along all such maps\nresults in a Segal groupoid which is also an invertible Segal space. We will denote\nthis functor Lc . There is an analogous functor in the model category ISeSpf which\nwe denote Lf .\nThus, using the fact that an invertible Segal space X has \"objects,\" \"mapping\nspaces,\" and a \"homotopy category\" Ho(X) (again, as given by Rezk in [27, \u00a75]),\nwe can define the classes of maps we need for the model structure SeGpdc . First, we\ndefine a Dwyer-Kan equivalence of invertible Segal spaces to be a map f : W \u2192 Z\nsuch that\n\u2022 the map mapW (x, y) \u2192 mapZ (f x, f y) is a weak equivalence of simplicial\nsets for any pair of objects x and y of W , and\n\u2022 the map Ho(W ) \u2192 Ho(Z) is an equivalence of categories.\nTheorem 4.5. There is a model category structure SeGpdc on the category of Segal\npregroupoids such that\n(1) a weak equivalence is a map f : X \u2192 Y such that the induced map Lc X \u2192\nLc Y is a Dwyer-Kan equivalence of Segal spaces,\n(2) a cofibration is a monomorphism (so every Segal pregroupoid is cofibrant),\nand\n(3) a fibration is a map with the right lifting property with respect to the maps\nwhich are cofibrations and weak equivalences.\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n11\n\nThis theorem can be proved using as generating cofibrations the set Ic defined\nabove and as generating acyclic cofibrations the set Jc = {i : A \u2192 B} of representatives of isomorphism classes of maps in SeGpd satisfying\n(1) for all n \u2265 0, the spaces An and Bn have countably many simplices, and\n(2) the map i : A \u2192 B is a monomorphism and a weak equivalence.\nGiven these definitions, the proof of the existence of the model structure SeGpdc ,\nwhile technical, follows just as the proof for the model structure SeCatc [7, 5.1].\nThe other model structure, SeGpdf , has the same weak equivalences as SeGpdc ,\nbut not all monomorphisms are cofibrations. Instead, we take the maps of Segal\nop\npregroupoids which are cofibrations in the projective model structure SSetsI\u2206\n.\nf\nTheorem 4.6. There is a cofibrantly generated model structure SeGpdf on the\ncategory of Segal pregroupoids given by the following classes of morphisms:\n(1) the weak equivalences are the same as those of SeGpdc ,\n(2) the cofibrations are the maps which can be obtained by taking iterated pushouts\nalong the maps in the set If , and\n(3) the fibrations are the maps with the right lifting property with respect to the\nmaps which are both cofibrations and weak equivalences.\nHere, the set of generating cofibrations is If , and the set of generating acyclic\ncofibrations is given by the set Jf which is defined analogously to Jc but using the\nnew definition of cofibration. Again, the proof follows just as in [7, 7.1].\n5. Quillen equivalences\nHere, we show that we still have Quillen equivalences between these various\nmodel categories. In fact, the proofs that we give in [7] continue to hold. Here\nwe give a sketch of what the various functors are connecting these categories. We\nbegin with the simplest example. Throughout, the topmost arrow indicates the left\nQuillen functor.\nProposition 5.1. The identity functor\nid : SeGpdf \u21c4 SeGpdc : id\nis a Quillen equivalence of model categories.\nTo compare the model categories SeGpdc and ICSS, first notice that we can\ntake the inclusion functor\nI : SeGpdc \u2192 ICSS.\nThis functor has a right adjoint R given as follows.\nRecall that, given any simplicial space X, we can consider its 0-coskeleton, denoted cosk0 (X) [26, \u00a71]. Let W be an invertible simplicial space, and regard W0\nand W0,0 as constant simplicial spaces. Consider the invertible simplicial spaces\nU = cosk0 (W0 ) and V = cosk0 (W0,0 ) and the natural maps W \u2192 U \u2190 V . Define\nRW to be the pullback of the diagram\n// V\nRW\n\u000f\u000f\nW\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// U.\n\nAs in [7, \u00a76], we can see that R is in fact a right adjoint and that the following\nresult holds:\n\n\f12\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nProposition 5.2. The adjoint pair\nI : SeGpdc \u21c4 ICSS : R\nis a Quillen equivalence of model categories.\nTo prove the existence of a Quillen equivalence between SGpd and SeGpdf , we\nfirst notice that via the nerve functor a simplicial groupoid can be regarded as a\nstrictly local object in the category of I\u2206op diagrams of simplicial sets with respect\nto the map \u03be used to define the invertible Segal space model structure. Thus, the\nnerve functor R : SGpd \u2192 SeGpdf can be shown to have a left adjoint via the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 5.3. [6, 5.6] Consider two categories, the category of all diagrams X : D \u2192\nSSets and the category of strictly local diagrams with respect to some set of maps\nS = {f : A \u2192 B}. The forgetful functor from the category of strictly local diagrams\nto the category of all diagrams has a left adjoint.\nDenoting this left adjoint F , the following result once again follows from the\nsame arguments given in [7, 8.6].\nTheorem 5.4. The adjoint pair\nF : SeGpdf \u21c4 SGpd : R\nis a Quillen equivalence of model categories.\nHowever, in this case we also have the following additional result, emphasizing\nthe idea that an (\u221e, 0)-category should just be a space (or simplicial set).\nTheorem 5.5. Let T : ICSS \u2192 SSets be the functor taking an invertible complete\nSegal space W to its 0-space W0 . This functor has a left adjoint given by the functor\nC : SSets \u2192 ICSS taking a simplicial set K to the constant invertible simplicial\nspace CK. This adjoint pair gives a Quillen equivalence of model categories.\nProof. It is not hard to show that C is left adjoint to T . To prove that this adjoint\npair is a Quillen pair, we observe that the left adjoint functor C preserves cofibrations because they are just monomorphisms in each category. It also preserves\nacyclic cofibrations because the image of a weak equivalence of simplicial sets is a\nReedy weak equivalence of simplicial spaces, and therefore also a weak equivalence\nin ICSS.\nBy the same reasoning, C also reflects weak equivalences between cofibrant objects. Thus, to prove that we have a Quillen equivalence it remains to show that the\nmap C(T W ) \u2192 W is a weak equivalence for any invertible complete Segal space\nW . However, C(T W ) = C(W0 ), the constant invertible simplicial set which has\nW0 in each degree. However, if W is an invertible complete Segal space, then the\nspaces in each degree are all weakly equivalent. Thus, the desired map is a weak\nequivalence.\n\u0003\nAgain, we note that this result is not surprising, in that Dwyer and Kan proved\nthat SGpd is Quillen equivalent to SSets in [12], but this particular Quillen equivalence with ICSS makes the relationship especially clear.\nWe conclude this section by noting some relationships between models for invertible homotopy theories as given in this paper and models for homotopy theories.\nRecall that the inclusion map \u2206op \u2192 I\u2206op induces a map\nop\n\nSSetsI\u2206\n\nop\n\n\u2192 SSets\u2206\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n13\n\nwhich has an \"invert\" map as a left adjoint. This adjoint pair is in fact a Quillen\npair when we consider the respective injective model category structures on the two\ncategories. Furthermore, we still have a Quillen pair\nICSS \u21c6 CSS\nbetween the localized model categories.\nThis adjoint relationship between CSS and ICSS (where the \"invert\" map is\nthe left adjoint) can be contrasted with an Quillen pair between CSS and SSets\nfor which the analogous map is the right adjoint. The map CSS \u2192 SSets given\nby taking a simplicial space X to the simplicial set X0 can be shown to have a\nleft adjoint (giving, essentially, a constant simplicial space). It can be shown to\nbe a right Quillen functor because if X is a fibrant object (i.e., a complete Segal\nspace and therefore Reedy fibrant), then X0 is fibrant in SSets as well, and because\nweak equivalences between complete Segal spaces give weak equivalences between\n0-spaces.\n6. A Bousfield approach to Segal groupoids and invertible complete\nSegal spaces\nAs in [4], we can also use a different approach to defining Segal groupoids and\ninvertible (complete) Segal spaces. The idea behind this method is, when moving\nfrom the ordinary Segal case to the invertible one, to change the projections used\nto define the Segal maps, an idea used by Bousfield [9].\nIn the category \u2206, consider the maps \u03b3 k : [1] \u2192 [n] given by 0 7\u2192 0 and 1 7\u2192 k +1\nfor any 0 \u2264 k < n. Just as the maps \u03b1k are used to define the ordinary Segal maps\n\u03c6k , we can use the maps \u03b3 k to define the Bousfield-Segal maps\n\u03c7n : Xn \u2192 X1 \u00d7X0 * * * \u00d7X0 X1\n{z\n}\n|\nn\n\nfor each n \u2265 2.\nDefinition 6.1. A Bousfield-Segal space is a Reedy fibrant simplicial space W\nsatisfying the condition that the Bousfield-Segal maps \u03c7n are weak equivalences for\nn \u2265 2.\nNotice that Bousfield-Segal spaces are really just another way to think about\ninvertible Segal spaces. We have given them a different name here to distinguish\nthem from our previous definition; when we consider model category structures\nthe distinction is more important, since the underlying category here is that of\nsimplicial spaces, rather than that of invertible simplicial spaces.\nTo define a model category structure on the category of simplicial spaces in which\nthe fibrant objects are Bousfield-Segal spaces, we need to define an appropriate map\nwith which to localize the Reedy model structure. For \u03b3 i defined as above, define\nH(k)t =\n\nk\u22121\n[\n\n\u03b3 i \u2206[1]t\n\ni=1\n\nand the inclusion map\n\u03c7k : H(k)t \u2192 \u2206[k]t .\n\n\f14\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nCombining these maps for all values of k, we obtain a map\na\n\u03c7=\n(\u03c7k : H(k)t \u2192 \u2206[k]t ).\nk\u22651\n\nTheorem 6.2. Localizing the Reedy model structure with respect to the map \u03c7\nresults in a model structure BSeSpc in which the fibrant objects are the BousfieldSegal spaces.\nAs usual, we can also localize the projective model structure with respect to the\nmap \u03c7 to obtain a model category BSeSpf .\nThe properties of invertible Segal spaces discussed previously continue to hold\nfor Bousfield-Segal spaces. In particular, we have the following definition.\nDefinition 6.3. A complete Bousfield-Segal space is a Bousfield-Segal space W for\nwhich the degeneracy map s0 : W0 \u2192 W1 is a weak equivalence.\nRecall the map \u03c8 : \u2206[0]t \u2192 E t used to define the (invertible) complete Segal\nspace model structure. We use it again here to establish what we call the complete\nBousfield-Segal space model structure on the category of simplicial spaces.\nTheorem 6.4. Localizing the model structure BSeSpc with respect to the map \u03c8\nresults in a model structure CBSS in which the fibrant objects are the complete\nBousfield-Segal spaces.\nWe now turn to the Bousfield approach to Segal groupoids. We gave the following\ndefinition in [4, \u00a76].\nDefinition 6.5. A Bousfield-Segal category is a Segal precategory for which the\nBousfield-Segal maps \u03c7n are weak equivalences for each n \u2265 2.\nIn [4], we consider the fixed object set case, in which we look at Bousfield-Segal\ncategories with a given set O in degree zero. In particular, we defined a fixed-object\nversion of the map \u03c7 as follows:\na\n\u0001\n\u03c7O =\n\u03c7kO : H(k)tO \u2192 \u2206[k]tO . .\nk\u22650\n\nProposition 6.6. [4, 6.1] Localizing the category SSpO,f with respect to the map\n\u03c7O results in a model structure LB SSpO,f whose fibrant objects are BousfieldSegal categories. Similarly, localizing SSpO,c with respect to \u03c7O results in a model\ncategory we denote LB SSpO,c .\nUsing these model structures, we can proceed to the more general case, in which\nwe have model structures BSeCatc and BSeCatf on the category of Segal precategories in which the fibrant objects are Bousfield-Segal categories. We first consider\nBSeCatc , which is analogous to SeCatc .\nConsidering the acyclic cofibrations given by the set\n{V [m, k] \u00d7 \u2206[n]t \u222a \u2206[m] \u00d7 H(n)t \u2192 \u2206[m] \u00d7 \u2206[n]t }\nfor n \u2265 1, m \u2265 1, and 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m enables us to define a \"localization\" functor\nLB,c taking a Segal precategory to a Bousfield-Segal category by taking a colimit\nof pushouts along the maps of this set.\nTheorem 6.7. There is a model category structure BSeCatc on the category of\nSegal precategories such that\n\n\fINVERTIBLE HOMOTOPY THEORIES\n\n15\n\n(1) a weak equivalence is a map f : X \u2192 Y such that the induced map LB,c X \u2192\nLB,c Y is a Dwyer-Kan equivalence of Bousfield-Segal spaces,\n(2) a cofibration is a monomorphism, and\n(3) a fibration is a map which has the right lifting property with respect to the\nmaps which are cofibrations and weak equivalences.\nIn particular, in this model structure, the cofibrations should be monomorphisms\nso that all objects are cofibrant. Therefore, we can use the same set of generating\ncofibrations,\n \u0307\n \u0307 t )r \u2192 (\u2206[m] \u00d7 \u2206[n]t )r },\nIc = {(\u2206[m]\n\u00d7 \u2206[n]t \u222a \u2206[m] \u00d7 \u2206[n]\nwhere m \u2265 0 when n \u2265 1, and when n = m = 0, that we used for SeCatc in [7,\n\u00a75]. We can define a set of generating acyclic cofibrations very similarly, namely,\nby a set of representatives of isomorphism classes of maps i : A \u2192 B which are\ncofibrations and weak equivalences such that for all n \u2265 0 the simplicial sets An\nand Bn have only countably many simplices. Notice that this definition only differs\nfrom the one in [7] in that we weak equivalences are defined here in terms of the\nfunctor LB,c rather than by the functor Lc taking a Segal precategory to a Segal\ncategory.\nGiven these generating sets, the proof of the existence of this model structure\nfollows just as in [7, 5.1]. Once again, we also have a companion model structure\nBSeCatf .\nFor this model structure, we use a functor LB,f taking a Segal precategory to a\nBousfield-Segal category which is fibrant in the projective, rather than the Reedy\nmodel structure, and then define the weak equivalences in terms of this functor.\nHowever, as before, it turns out that the two functors define the same class of weak\nequivalences [7, \u00a77]. Just as in SeCatf , we make use of the set\nIf = {Pm,n \u2192 Qm,n | m, n \u2265 0}.\nTheorem 6.8. There is a model category structure BSeCatf on the category of\nSegal precategories such that\n(1) weak equivalences are the same as those in BSeCatc ,\n(2) a cofibration is a map which can be obtained by taking iterated pushouts\nalong the maps in the set If , and\n(3) a fibration is a map which has the right lifting property with respect to the\nmaps which are cofibrations and weak equivalences.\nNow, we have the following results, analogous to those of the previous section.\nProposition 6.9. The identity functor induces a Quillen equivalence\nid : BSeCatf \u21c4 BSeCatc : id.\nTheorem 6.10. The inclusion functor\nI : BSeCatc \u2192 CBSS\nhas a right adjoint, and this adjoint pair is a Quillen equivalence.\nAs described in the previous section, the right adjoint here, applied to an object\nW of CBSS, is given by a pullback of the diagram\nW \u2192 cosk0 (W0 ) \u2190 cosk0 (W0,0 ).\n\n\f16\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nThe proof that this map is adjoint to the inclusion map and that the adjoint pair\nis in fact a Quillen equivalence of model categories follows just as the one given in\n[\u00a76]thesis.\nWe can again make use of Lemma 5.3 and an argument like the one in [7, 8.6]\nto prove the following result.\nTheorem 6.11. The nerve functor\nR : SGpd \u2192 BSeCatf\nhas a left adjoint, and this adjoint pair is a Quillen equivalence.\nLastly, we can compare the model structure CBSS to the model structure on\nsimplicial sets just as we did in the proof of Theorem 5.5.\nTheorem 6.12. Let T : CBSS \u2192 SSets be the functor taking an complete BousfieldSegal space W to its 0-space W0 . This functor has a left adjoint C : SSets \u2192 CBSS\ntaking a simplicial set K to the constant invertible simplicial space CK. This adjoint pair gives a Quillen equivalence of model categories.\nReferences\n[1] John Baez, The homotopy hypothesis, talk given at the Fields Institute, January 2007, slides\navailable at http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/homotopy/ .\n[2] Clark Barwick, private communication.\n[3] Clemens Berger, A cellular nerve for higher categories, Adv.

BERGNER\n\n1. Statement of previous error\nIn previous work, we studied various kinds of functors X : \u2206op \u2192 SSets satisfying a Segal condition, so that the maps\nXn \u2192 X1 \u00d7X0 * * * \u00d7X0 X1\n|\n{z\n}\nn\n\nare weak equivalences of simplicial sets for n \u2265 2. When we imposed the additional\ncondition that X0 = \u2206[0], such objects, called reduced Segal categories or Segal\nmonoids were shown to be equivalent to simplicial monoids [4]. When instead\nX0 = \u2210\u2206[0], some discrete simplicial set, then X is a Segal category can more\ngenerally be regarded as an up-to-homotopy model for a simplicial category with\nthis same object set [4].\nThese results were used in the comparison between the model structure for all\nSegal categories (not just with a fixed set in degree zero) and the model structure\nfor simplicial categories [6]. Furthermore, the former model structure was shown to\nbe Quillen equivalent to the model structure for complete Segal spaces, or functors\n\u2206op \u2192 SSets where the discrete level zero condition is replaced with a \"completeness\" condition [6].\nA natural question was then whether these results could be generalized to an\n\"invertible\" and two methods were proposed in both of the papers [2], [3]. The\nfirst was to replace \u2206op in the above definitions with a category I\u2206op in which the\nobjects had an involution map. However, these results were in fact incorrect, in\nthat this involution does not adequately encode an inverse map. In this note, we\nclarify that this diagram should encode the structure of a monoid with involution\nrather than a group, or category with involution rather than a groupoid, in the case\nof multiple objects.\nThe second approach given in these papers, given by using different projection\nmaps as first used by Bousfield [7], is still correct.\nAcknowledgments.

BERGNER\n\n2. Replacing groups with monoids with involution\nIn the case of monoids, we consider functors \u2206op \u2192 SSets, where the category\n\u2206op has as objects finite ordered sets [n] = (0 \u2192 1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 n) for each n \u2265 0 and as\nmorphisms the opposites of the order-preserving maps between them. Notice that\neach [n] can be regarded as a category with n + 1 objects and a single morphism\ni \u2192 j whenever i \u2264 j.\nIn [2] we defined a category I\u2206op , whose objects are given by small groupoids\nI[n] = (0 \u21c4 1 \u21c6 * * * \u21c4 n) for n \u2265 0. In other words, each I[n] is a category with\nn + 1 objects and a single isomorphism between any two objects. The morphisms\nof I\u2206op are generated by two sets of maps: the opposite of the order-preserving\nmaps from \u2206op , and an involution morphism on each I[n] which sends each i to\nn \u2212 i.\nThe hope was that functors I\u2206op \u2192 SSets satisfying a Segal condition encoded a\ngroup structure. Unfortunately, inverses are not adequately given, so such functors\nactually give the structure of a monoid with involution. Thus, we change the\nterminology given in [2] as follows.\nIn the case of \u2206, the simplicial set \u2206[n] is given by the representable functor\nHom\u2206 (\u2212, [n]). Similarly, we can define an object I\u2206[n] which is given by the\nrepresentable functor HomI\u2206 (\u2212, I[n]). These n-simplices with involution are the\nstandard building blocks of the spaces we consider here. In particular, every simplex\nshould be regarded as having a corresponding \"reverse\" simplex. As with simplicial\nsets, we can consider the boundary of I\u2206[n], denoted \u2202I\u2206[n], which consists of the\nnondegenerate simplices of I\u2206[n] of degree less than n.\nThus, we can define an simplicial set with involution to be a functor I\u2206op \u2192 Sets\nand, more generally, an simplicial object with involution in a category C to be a\nfunctor I\u2206op \u2192 C. We denote the category of simplicial sets with involution\nby ISSets. We further consider the case of simplicial spaces with involution, or\nfunctors I\u2206op \u2192 SSets. Since there is a forgetful functor U : ISSets \u2192 SSets\nop\nop\n(respectively, U : SSetsI\u2206 \u2192 SSets\u2206 ), we define a map f of simplicial sets\n(respectively, spaces) with involution to be a weak equivalence if U (f ) is a weak\nequivalence of simplicial sets (respectively, spaces).\nIn particular, we define a Segal precategory with involution to be an simplicial\nspace with involution X such that the simplicial set X0 is discrete. If X0 = \u2206[0],\nthen we call it a Segal premonoid with involution. To define a Segal category with\ninvolution, use the maps\n\u03ben : Xn \u2192 X1 \u00d7X0 * * * \u00d7X0 X1\n{z\n}\n|\nn\n\ndefined in [2, \u00a74]. Thus, a Segal category with involution is a Segal precategory\nwith involution X such that for each n \u2265 2 the map \u03ben is a weak equivalence of\nsimplicial sets.\nObtaining an appropriate model structure requires localization with respect to\nthe following map:\na\na\n(IG(n)tx \u2192 I\u2206[n]tx )).\n\u03beO =\n(\u03be n :\nn\u22651\n\nx\u2208O n+1\n\nThe proofs of the following two propositions continue to hold, with the necessary\nchanges in terminology.\n\n\fERRATUM TO \"ADDING INVERSES\"\n\n3\nop\n\nProposition 2.1. [2, 4.1] There is a model category structure LSSetsI\u2206\nO,f on the\ncategory of Segal precategories with involution with a fixed set O in degree zero in\nwhich the weak equivalences and fibrations are given levelwise. Similarly, there is\nop\na model category structure LSSetsI\u2206\nO,c on the same underlying category in which\nthe weak equivalences and cofibrations are given levelwise. Furthermore, we can\nlocalize each of these model category structures with the map \u03beO to obtain model\nop\nI\u2206op\nstructures LSSetsI\u2206\nwhose fibrant objects are Segal categories\nO,f and LSSetsO,c\nwith involution.\nProposition 2.2. [2, 4.2] The adjoint pair given by the identity functor induces a\nQuillen equivalence of model categories\nop\n// LSSetsI\u2206op .\nLSSetsI\u2206 oo\nO,f\n\nO,c\n\nIn [2], we claimed that there was a Quillen equivalence\nop\n\nLSSetsT\u2217 G \u21c6 LSSetsI\u2206\n\u2217,f .\nUnfortunately, we did not adequately establish that we obtained group structures\nusing this category I\u2206op . We seek to establish that our previous proof instead gave\na Quillen equivalence\nop\nLSSetsT\u2217 M I \u21c6 LSSetsI\u2206\n\u2217,f\nwhere TMI is the theory of monoids with involution.\nThis theory TMI has as objects Tk which are given by the free monoid with\ninvolution on k generators. In other words, Tk is free on generators x1 , . . . , xk and\nx1 , . . . , xk with involution I(xk ) = xk . There is a monoid map \u03c4 : Tk \u2192 Tk given\nby xj 7\u2192 xk\u2212j+1 . This map will correspond to the flip map of each object I[k] in\nI\u2206op .\nUsing Badzioch's theorem from [1], such a Quillen equivalence will complete the\nproof of the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.3. The model category structure Alg TM I is Quillen equivalent to the\nop\nmodel category structure LSSetsI\u2206\n\u2217,f .\nAs in [4], we prove this theorem using several lemmas. Note that in the model\nop\nstructure LSSetsI\u2206\n\u2217,c , we denote by L1 the localization, or fibrant replacement\nfunctor. Analogously, we denote by L2 the localization functor in LSSetsT\u2217 M I .\nThe first step in the proof of the theorem is to show what the localization functor\nL1 does to the n-simplex with involution I\u2206[n]t . By Inerve(\u2212)t , we denote the representable functor Hom(I[n], \u2212), viewed as a transposed constant simplicial space.\nIt is here, Lemma [2, 4.5], that the major error occurred. The correct statement is\nas follows.\nProposition 2.4. Let Fn denote the free monoid with involution on n generators.\nop\nt\nt\nThen in LSSetsI\u2206\n\u2217,c , L1 I\u2206[n]\u2217 is weakly equivalent to Inerve(Fn ) for each n \u2265 0.\nIn the proof, we defined a filtration of Inerve(F1 )t as follows:\n)\n(\nj\nX\nnj\nt\nn1\n|nl | \u2264 k\n\u03a8k (Inerve(F1 ) )j = (x | * * * |x ) |\nl=1\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere x and its \"inverse\" x denote the two nondegenerate 1-simplices of I\u2206[1]t\u2217 =\n\u03a81 . The problem is that we assumed here that x could be canceled with x\u22121 , when\n\n\f4\n\nJULIA E. BERGNER\n\nthere is no structure built in to I\u2206op to make this cancelation possible. In short, we\ndo not really have the structure of a group, but only of a monoid with involution.\nTherefore, we instead define the filtration of Inerve(F1 )t by\n\u03a8k (Inerve(F1 )t )j = {(w1 | * * * |wj ) | l(w1 * * * wj ) \u2264 k}\nwhere the wi are words in x and x, and l denotes word length.\nWith this modification, the previous proof goes through as before.\nTo obtain the appropriate adjoint pair for the Quillen equivalence, we first define\na functor J : I\u2206op \u2192 TMI . On objects, this functor is defined by In 7\u2192 Tn . On\nface and degeneracy maps coming from \u2206op , this functor behaves the same as the\nfunctor \u2206op \u2192 TM as defined in [4]. Specifically, the coface and codegeneracy maps\nmaps in I\u2206 are given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ni>k\ni\u2264k\n\uf8f2xk\n\uf8f2xk\ni\ni\nd (xk ) = xk xk+1 i = k and s (xk ) = e\ni=k\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f3\nxk+1\ni<k\nxk\u22121 i < k \u2212 1.\nThe involution map is sent to the map \u03c4 : Tl \u2192 Tl defined by xk 7\u2192 yl\u2212k+1 .\nThis functor J induces a map\nop\n\nMI\nJ \u2217 : LSSetsT\u2217,f\n\u2192 LSSetsI\u2206\n\u2217,f\n\nfor which we have a left adjoint J\u2217 via left Kan extension.\nAs in [2], define IM [k] to be the functor TMI \u2192 SSets given by\nFn 7\u2192 HomTM I (Fk , Fn ) = (Fk )n ,\nand let H = Inerve(Fk )t . The following results continue to hold, replacing TG with\nTMI .\nLemma 2.5. [2, 4.9] In LSSetsT\u2217 M I , L2 J\u2217 (H) is weakly equivalent to IM [k].\nop\n\nProposition 2.6.
