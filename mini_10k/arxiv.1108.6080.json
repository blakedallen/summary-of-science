INTRODUCTION\n\nOver the past 2 decades, the Lyman-\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) forest absorption observed in the spectrum of high-redshift\nquasars has been an important probe of large-scale structure and the inter-galactic medium (IGM) at z & 2.\nThe fundamental quantity of interest of the Ly\u03b1 forest is its local optical depth to absorption, \u03c4 (~x), at position ~x. This is not a directly observed quantity: it\nis derived from the flux transmission F \u2261 e\u2212\u03c4 , which\nrequires knowledge of the intrinsic quasar continuum\nC(\u03bbrest ) in order to be extracted from the observed flux,\nF \u2261 f (\u03bbobs )/C(\u03bbrest ), where f (\u03bbobs ) is the observed flux\nand \u03bbrest \u2261 \u03bbobs /(1 + zQSO ) is the restframe wavelength\nof the quasar at redshift z = zQSO . The error in the\nmeasured optical depth, \u03b4\u03c4 , scales roughly with the fractional continuum error, \u03b4\u03c4 \u223c \u03b4C/C, which means that\naccurate continuum fitting is important in the optically\nthin Ly\u03b1 forest, where \u03c4 . 1. Therefore, accurate estimates of the underlying quasar continuum are crucial in\norder to take full advantage of modern Ly\u03b1 forest data\nsets.\nWhile virtually all aspects of Ly\u03b1 forest science are\ndependent on the continuum determination, some are\nmore sensitive than others. For example, the Ly\u03b1 flux\nprobability distribution, which is used to constrain the\nIGM temperature-density relation (TDR), is notoriously\nsensitive to continuum errors: Lee (2011) have recently\nfound that a 2% systematic error in the continuum estimation can double the errors in the TDR even with high\nsignal-to-noise data. On the other hand, measurements\nlee@astro.princeton.edu\n1 Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University,\nPrinceton, New Jersey 08544, USA\n2 E.O. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd.,\nBerkeley, CA, 94720, USA\n\nof the 1-dimensional flux power spectrum PF (k) and\nother 2-point statistics (e.g. threshold clustering functions, Lee & Spergel 2011) are affected by the Fourier\npower introduced by intrinsic quasar emission lines in\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest region. For example, the unaccounted\ncontinuum variance in the quasar continuum has limited the measurement of the 1-dimensional Ly\u03b1 forest\nflux power spectrum (McDonald et al. 2006) to comoving scales of r . 40 h\u22121 Mpc at z = 2.5. Ongoing attempts to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\nfeature in the Ly\u03b1 forest using transverse correlations\nacross lines-of-sight are less sensitive to continuum errors (McDonald & Eisenstein 2007); however, large continuum errors will still degrade the significance of the\nBAO signal measured in this fashion.\nUnfortunately, accurate quasar continuum fitting is\na non-trivial problem. At redshifts (z & 2) in which\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest becomes accessible to ground-based optical telescopes, the high absorber line-density makes\nit challenging to identify the intrinsic quasar continuum. With high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\n(S/N) quasar spectra obtained from large telescopes,\ncontinua are usually fitted using some form of splinefitting to the observed transmission peaks of the forest - if one believes that the transmission peaks truly\nreach the quasar continuum at a given redshift (but see\nFaucher-Gigu\u00e8re et al. 2008; Lee 2011). These directfitting methods cannot, in general, be applied to large\ndata sets such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as the\nmodest resolution and low S/N make it impossible to directly fit the Ly\u03b1 forest except for the very highest S/N\nsubsamples - and even then steps need to be taken to account for the degradation of transmission peaks from the\nlower resolution (see, e.g., Dall'Aglio et al. 2009). Moreover, direct fitting techniques usually require significant\n\n\f2\n\nLee et al.\n\nhuman intervention and are often very time-consuming,\nprecluding their application to the \u223c 104 Ly\u03b1 forest\nsightlines in SDSS.\nNoisy Ly\u03b1 forest data usually require some form of\nextrapolation from the relatively unabsorbed spectrum\nbluewards3 of the quasar's Ly\u03b1 \u03bb1216 broad emission\nline. The simplest way to do this is to fit a power-law\nf\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 to spectral regions uncontaminated by quasar\nemission lines redwards of Ly\u03b1, or even to eschew fitting individual spectra and extrapolate a mean powerlaw from \u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5, using power-law values from the\nliterature (Vanden Berk et al. 2001, from, e.g.,).\nThere are two major issues with power-law estimation\nof Ly\u03b1 forest continua. Firstly, there is a break in the\nunderlying quasar power-law at \u03bbrest \u223c 1200\u00c5 \u2212 1300\u00c5.\nThis was first identified by Zheng et al. (1997) from a\nstudy of low-redshift (zQSO \u223c 1) quasars observed in the\nultra-violet, in which the Ly\u03b1 forest continuum could\nbe clearly identified due to the low Ly\u03b1 line density at\nthose epochs. A subsequent study by Telfer et al. (2002)\nfound mean power-law indices of h\u03b1NUV i = \u22120.69 and\nh\u03b1EUV i = \u22121.76 redwards and bluewards of \u03bbrest \u223c\n1200\u00c5, respectively. This implies that a na\u0131\u0308ve power-law\nextrapolation from \u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5 would underestimate\nthe true Ly\u03b1 forest continuum by \u223c 10%. Furthermore,\nTelfer et al. (2002) found a large scatter in \u03b1NUV and\n\u03b1EUV from the individual quasars in their sample, with\nno correlation between the two; this increases the error\nfrom power-law extrapolation in individual Ly\u03b1 forest\nspectra. While Desjacques et al. (2007) and P\u00e2ris et al.\n(2011) have discussed this EUV-NUV power-law break\nin the context of Ly\u03b1 forest continuum estimation, it is\noften ignored in Ly\u03b1 forest analyses.\nSecondly, the Ly\u03b1 forest 'continuum' (usually defined\naround \u03bbrest \u2248 1040\u00c5 \u2212 1180\u00c5) includes weak emission lines such as Fe II \u03bb1071 and Fe II/Fe III \u03bb1123,\nalthough the exact identifications vary from author to\nauthor. These emission lines can cause deviations of\nup to \u223c 10% from a flat continuum. It is possible to\ntake these features into account on average: for example, Bernardi et al. (2003) modeled them as two Gaussian functions superposed on top of an underlying powerlaw. However, there is a great diversity in the shape and\nequivalent width of these weak emission lines (Suzuki\n2006). Therefore, the use of an average continuum shape\nwould not account for variations of up to 10% within individual quasars due the presence of these emission lines.\nOne possible avenue for improved quasar continuum fits is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nSuzuki et al. (2005) explored this using a sample of 50\nlow-redshift quasars observed in the UV by the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST), in which the \u03bbrest < 1216\u00c5 continuum can be clearly identified. They concluded that\nwhile PCA fits to the red-side (\u03bbrest = 1216 \u2212 1600\u00c5)\nof individual spectrum gave a good prediction of the\nLy\u03b1 continuum shape (i.e. the weak emission lines), the\noverall continuum amplitude had \u223c 10% errors. This\nis presumably due to the EUV-NUV power-law break.\nP\u00e2ris et al. (2011) recently carried out a similar analysis\non a high-S/N (S/N & 10 per pixel) subsample of the\n3 In this paper, we use the terms 'blue' and 'red' relative to the\nquasar Ly\u03b1 emission line unless otherwise noted\n\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar sample. They\nfound a better prediction accuracy of \u223c 5%, possibly due\nto their larger spectral baseline (\u03bbrest \u2248 1025\u00c5 \u2212 2000\u00c5\nas opposed to \u03bbrest \u2248 1025\u00c5\u22121600\u00c5 in the earlier work).\nHowever, the standard PCA formalism does not take\npixel noise into account, whereas the majority of quasars\nobserved in SDSS have low signal-to-noise (S/N < 10)\nFrancis et al. (1992) have argued that PCA fitting errors\nscale directly with the noise level, which implies that,\ne.g., one can expect no better than \u223c 20% continuum\naccuracy in a S/N = 5 spectrum using PCA, even without taking the power-law break into account.\nFor all the reasons outlined above, more accurate\ncontinuum-fitting methods are sorely needed to take\nfull advantage of Ly\u03b1 forest data from SDSS and future spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we will explore a refinement of the PCA technique which we term\n'mean-flux regulated PCA' (MF-PCA). Briefly, we carry\nout least-squares-fitting of PCA templates to the unabsorbed quasar spectrum redwards (\u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5) of the\nLy\u03b1 line in order to obtain a prediction for the continuum shape, and then use the expected mean flux,\nhF i(z), to constrain the amplitude of the fitted continuum. Tytler et al. (2004) have shown that the dispersion\nin hF i expected from a \u2206z = 0.1 segment of Ly\u03b1 forest\nat z = 2 is \u03c3F (\u2206z = 0.1) \u2248 4%. When averaged across\nan entire Ly\u03b1 forest sightline (which spans \u2206z \u2248 0.4\nfor a quasar at zQSO = 2.5), one expects the continuum\namplitude to be predicted to \u223c 2%.\nThis paper is organized as follows: \u00a7 2 describes the\npublicly available SDSS quasar sample which will be the\ninitial subject of our new technique. \u00a7 3 elucidates the\nMF-PCA technique, which is then tested on mock spectra in \u00a7 4. We will then discuss the results of our continuum fitting and future improvements. The continuumfits have been made publicly available and can be downloaded via anonymous FTP4 .\n2. DATA\n\nThe MF-PCA technique which we develop in this paper is optimized towards large sets of noisy Ly\u03b1 forest\ndata spectra. We will apply this technique to the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey data, which comprises \u223c 104 Ly\u03b1\nforest sightlines at moderate resolution (R \u2248 2000) and\nmodest signal-to-noise (S/N \u223c few per pixel).\nThis section provides an overview of the SDSS Ly\u03b1\nforest data sample, and also the two sets of quasar templates which we will use to fit this data set.\n2.1. SDSS DR7 Ly\u03b1 Forest Sample\nIn this paper, we carry out continuum-fitting for\npublicly-available spectra from the final SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) quasar catalog (Schneider et al. 2010),\nwhich is comprised of 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars observed from the 2.5m SDSS Telescope\nin Apache Point, NM. The spectra cover the observed\nwavelength range \u03bbobs = 3800\u00c5 \u2212 9200\u00c5 with a spectral\nresolution of R \u2261 \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u2248 2000.\nFrom this overall catalog, we select a subsample suitable for Ly\u03b1 forest studies. First, we require that\nsome portion of the quasar Ly\u03b1 forest region, \u03bbrest =\n4\n\nftp.astro.princeton.edu/lee/continua/\n\n\fMF-PCA Continuum Fitting to SDSS Ly\u03b1 Forest\n(a)\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.- (a) Redshift distribution of the SDSS DR7 quasars fitted in this paper, in \u2206zQSO = 0.1 bins. We have selected objects with\nzQSO \u2265 2.3, which have reasonable coverage of the Ly\u03b1 forest. 53 quasars with zQSO > 5.0 are not shown in this plot. The gaps at\nzQSO \u2248 2.7 and zQSO \u2248 3.5 are where the quasar colors cross the stellar locus, making it difficult to select quasars with these redshifts\n(see, e.g., Richards 2002). (b) Median S/N per pixel in our quasar sample, in the Ly\u03b1 forest (\u03bbrest = 1041\u00c5 \u2212 1185\u00c5; black solid lines) and\nredwards of the quasar Ly\u03b1 emission line ( \u03bbrest = 1225\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5; red dashed lines). The histograms are in bins of \u2206S/N = 0.5. Note\nthat the majority of the Ly\u03b1 forest sightlines have S/N < 10 pixel\u22121 .\n\n1041\u00c5\u22121185\u00c5, be within the observed wavelength range.\nSince the extreme blue end (near \u03bbobs \u2248 3800\u00c5) of the\nSDSS spectra are known to suffer from spectrophotometric problems, we use \u03bbobs = 3840\u00c5 as the lower wavelength limit. This sets a minimum quasar redshift of\nzQSO = 2.3. For the quasars that satisfy this redshift\ncriterion, we excise the portions of the spectra that lie\nbelow \u03bbobs = 3840\u00c5. In addition, broad absorption line\n(BAL) quasars have continua which are difficult to characterize (although see Allen et al. 2011, for a method to\nrecover quasar continua from BALs), therefore we discard quasars flagged as BALs in the Shen et al. (2011)\nvalue-added quasar catalog.\nThere are 13,133 quasars in the DR7 quasar catalog which satisfy the above criteria. We make further quality cuts by discarding 962 spectra which have\nSPPIXMASK = 0 \u2212 12 bitmasks set (this signifies issues\nwith the fiber; see Stoughton et al. 2002, for further details on the SDSS bitmask system), and 2 spectra where\nthe signal-to-noise was too low to normalize the spectra, leading to negative normalizations. This leaves us\nwith a sample of 12,069 spectra, to which we will apply\nthe MF-PCA technique. Within individual spectra, we\nmask pixels which have either zero inverse-variance or the\nSPPIXMASK = 16 \u2212 28 maskbits set. This avoids the\nuse of problematic pixels, such as rejected extractions,\nbright sky-lines or bad flats.\nThe median signal-to-noise in the sample is S/N = 3.0\nper 69 km s\u22121 SDSS pixel within the Ly\u03b1 forest, and\nS/N = 6.2 per pixel in the \u03bbrest = 1225\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5 wavelength region. The redshift and signal-to-noise5 distributions of our final quasar sample is shown in Figure 1.\nIt is clear that the Ly\u03b1 forest data from DR7 are noisy.\nMost of the sightlines have median S/N < 10 within the\nLy\u03b1 forest, which is too noisy to be fitted individually\n5 Henceforth, all signal-to-noise values quoted in this paper\nare the median values per 69 km s\u22121 pixel, in the range \u03bbrest =\n1225\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5 unless indicated otherwise\n\nusing existing techniques.\nIn addition, we need to deal with Damped Ly\u03b1 Absorbers (DLAs) within the spectra. These are absorbing systems with neutral hydrogen column densities of\nNHI \u2265 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 which result in complete absorption over large portions (\u2206v \u223c 103 km s\u22121 ) of affected\nsight-lines. Since the MF-PCA technique (\u00a7 3) fits the\namplitude of the quasar continuum based on the meanflux of the low column-density Ly\u03b1 forest, the excess\nabsorption of a DLA within a sightline would bias the\ncontinuum estimate.\nTo correct for this, we use a catalog of 1427 DLAs\nidentified in the SDSS DR7 spectra by Noterdaeme et al.\n(2009). First, we mask the wavelength region corresponding to the equivalent width of each DLA (Draine\n2011):\nW \u2248 \u03bb\u03b1\n\n\u0014\n\ne2\nNHI f\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\nme c 2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\nc\n\n\u0013\u00151/2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u03b1 = 1216\u00c5 is the rest-frame wavelength of the\nhydrogen Ly\u03b1 transition, e is the electron charge, me\nis the electron mass, c is the speed of light, NHI is the\nH I column density of the DLA, f\u03b1 is the Ly\u03b1 oscillator\nstrength, and \u03b3\u03b1 is the sum of the Einstein A coefficients\nfor the transition.\nHowever, the damping wings of each DLA extend beyond the equivalent width, providing a small but nonnegligible excess absorption to the pixels close to the\nDLA. We correct for this by multiplying each pixel in\nthe spectrum with exp(\u03c4wing (\u2206\u03bb)), where\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03bb\ne2 \u03b3\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\n(2)\nf\nN\n\u03bb\n\u03c4wing (\u2206\u03bb) =\n\u03b1\nHI\n\u03b1\nme c2 4\u03c0\n\u2206\u03bb\nand \u2206\u03bb \u2261 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1 is the wavelength separation in the\nDLA restframe.\n2.2. Quasar Templates\n\n\f4\n\nLee et al.\n\nIn order to predict the shape of the Ly\u03b1 forest continuum, we need a set of template spectra with clearly\nidentified continua at wavelengths \u03bbrest < 1216\u00c5. For\nthis purpose, we will use two different sets of quasar\ntemplates, derived from quasars observed in the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST), and SDSS itself.\nSuzuki et al. (2005) derived PCA templates from 50\nquasars that had been observed by the Far Object Spectrograph (FOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope in the\nultraviolet. At the low-redshifts (0.14 < zQSO < 1.04) of\nthese quasars, the line-density of the Ly\u03b1 forest is sufficiently small that the quasar continuum could be clearly\nidentified. This enabled the creation of templates in the\nrange \u03bbrest = 1025\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5, covering Ly\u03b2 \u03bb1025 to\nC IV \u03bb1549.\nP\u00e2ris et al. (2011) recently carried out a similar study,\napplying the techniques in Suzuki et al. (2005) to a\nsubsample of 78 SDSS DR7 quasars. These zQSO \u2248\n3 quasars were selected to have full coverage of the\nLy\u03b1 forest and relatively high signal-to-noise (S/N &\n10 pixel\u22121 ). The transmission peaks in the Ly\u03b1 forest\nwere hand-fitted with a low-order spline function to provide a continuum estimate. PCA templates were then\nderived in the spectral range \u03bbrest = 1020\u00c5 \u2212 2000\u00c5,\nwhich included the C III \u03bb1906 line. While this process\nmight give a biased continuum level due to the low resolution and S/N of the templates, it should provide a good\ndescription of the relative shape of the quasar continuum\nwhich is required for MF-PCA - the mean-flux regulation process is designed to correct for uncertainties in the\noverall continuum level arising from pure PCA fitting.\nWe do not expect the redshift differences between the\ntemplate and the DR7 quasars to be a significant issue,\neven for the Suzuki et al. (2005) quasars (hzQSO i \u2248 0.6).\nThis is because various studies (e.g. vanden Berk et al.\n2004; Fan 2006) have suggested that there is little redshift evolution of quasar spectra. However, the shape of\nquasar spectra is known to have a significant luminosity dependence, such as the well-known Baldwin effect\n(Baldwin et al. 1978), which is the anti-correlation between the strength of the C IV \u03bb1549 emission line and\nthe quasar luminosity. It is therefore reasonable to supposed that there would be a significant difference in the\nspectral shapes represented by two templates and the\noverall SDSS sample. This is because the Suzuki et al.\n(2005) sample is comprised of relatively low-luminosity,\nnearby quasars as opposed to the P\u00e2ris et al. (2011)\nquasars, which were selected to have high S/Nand are\ntherefore a luminous subsample of the SDSS quasars.\nIn order to compare the relative luminosities, we calculate \u03bbL1280 , the intrinsic monochromatic luminosity near\n\u03bbrest = 1280\u00c5, for the quasars in our SDSS DR7 sample as well as the two template samples. We assume a\nstandard \u039bCDM cosmology with h = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.28,\nand \u03a9m + \u03a9\u039b = 1. The respective distributions of\n\u03bbL1280 is shown in Figure 2. The SDSS DR7 quasars\nhave a typical luminosity of \u03bbL1280 \u2248 1046.3 ergs/s,\nwhile the Suzuki et al. (2005) and P\u00e2ris et al. (2011)\nquasars are about 0.5 dex fainter and brighter, respectively. However, the combined luminosity distributions\nof the Suzuki et al. (2005) and P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) template quasars significantly overlap the full range of SDSS\nDR7 quasars, which justitifes the use of both templates\n\nFig. 2.- Intrinsic luminosity distribution of quasars from SDSS\nDR7 (12,069 spectra; black solid line), Suzuki et al. (2005) (50\nspectra; blue dot-dashed line), and P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) (78 spectra;\nred dashed-line), as estimated from \u03bbL1280 . This histograms have\nbin widths of \u2206 log10 (\u03bbL1280 ) = 0.25, and are normalized such\nthat the sum of all the bins in each histogram is unity.\n\nin this paper.\n3. METHOD\n\nThe mean-flux regulated PCA (MF-PCA) fitting\nmethod described in this paper is essentially a two step\nprocess: (1) fitting of the red side (\u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5) of\nthe individual quasar spectra using PCA templates, to\npredict the shape of the weak emission lines in the Ly\u03b1\nforest continuum. This is followed by (2) constraining\nthe amplitude of the predicted Ly\u03b1 forest continuum to\nbe consistent with existing measurements of the meanflux evolution of the Ly\u03b1 forest, hF i(z).\n3.1. Least-squares PCA Fitting\nThe basic concept of principal component analysis\n(PCA) is that a normalized quasar spectrum, f (\u03bb), can\nbe represented as\n\nf (\u03bb) \u2248 \u03bc(\u03bb) +\n\nm\nX\n\ncj \u03bej (\u03bb),\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03bc(\u03bb) is the mean quasar spectrum, \u03bej (\u03bb) is the\njth principal component or 'eigenspectrum', and cj are\nthe weights for an individual quasar. The formalism\nfor deriving the eigenspectra and weights is described\nin Suzuki et al. (2005) and P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) .\nThe standard PCA formalism for deriving the weights,\ncj , does not take into account spectral noise, which\nrenders it unsuitable for noisy SDSS spectra (see Figure 1b). Instead, we first carry out a least-squares fit\nto the red-side of each spectrum using the full \u03bbrest \u2248\n1000\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5 eigenspectra as a basis. Due to the correlation between the weak emission lines within the Ly\u03b1\nforest and in \u03bbrest \u223c 1300\u00c5\u2212 1500\u00c5 (Suzuki et al. 2005),\nwe expect this to provide a reasonable prediction for the\nshape of the continuum.\nAs described in \u00a7 2.2, we have two separate sets of PCA\neigenspectra from Suzuki et al. (2005) and P\u00e2ris et al.\n(2011). In principle, one could combine the two sets\nof quasar templates to generate one set of eigenspectra\n\n\fMF-PCA Continuum Fitting to SDSS Ly\u03b1 Forest\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- Successful examples of our least-squares PCA fitting method on SDSS quasar spectra with different S/N. In each plot, we show\nthe observed flux (orange), pipeline noise (green), Cinit , the PCA fit from the first line-masking iteration (black dashed-line), and final PCA\nfit, CPCA (black solid line). Crosses indicate pixels which have been discarded by our absorption line-masking scheme. The vertical dashed\nlines indicate \u03bbrest = 1216\u00c5 in the quasar restframe; all fitting is carried out redwards of this wavelength. The median S/N value quoted\nis evaluated redwards of the Ly\u03b1 emission line, and the absolute flux error, |\u03b4F |, is defined in Equation 4. Note that the amplitude of the\nLy\u03b1 forest continuum (\u03bbrest < 1216\u00c5) is not well-fitted by the PCA procedure, and will need to be corrected in the mean-flux regulation\nstep (\u00a7 3.2)\n\nwhich would encompass the diversity of both template\nsamples. However, the template spectra from P\u00e2ris et al.\n(2011) are not available to us at time of writing, therefore\nwe will carry out our fitting procedure separately for the\ntwo sets of PCA eigenspectra. Suzuki et al. (2005) had\nfound that out of their 10 principal component eigenspectra, only the first 8 components appeared to describe physical features in the spectra, while the 9th\nand 10th components seemed to describe mostly noise.\nTherefore, we will use only 8 components from each set\nof eigenspectra for our fits. In addition, for the sake\nof consistency we limit ourselves to the rest-wavelength\nrange \u03bbrest = 1020\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5 of each eigenspectrum even\nthough the P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) eigenspectra extend up to\n\u03bbrest = 2000\u00c5.\nHowever, we have found that fitting the SDSS spectra\nwith just the PCA weights cj was insufficient to account\nfor the large diversity of the sample. Therefore, we introduce 2 additional fit parameters: a power-law component, \u03b1\u03bb , and redshift-correction factor, cz . The powerlaw component, \u03b1\u03bb , is necessary due to the large range of\n\nslopes found in the SDSS quasars. Even though the 3rd\nthrough 5th principal components in the HST eigenspectra include the spectral slope, they also describe some\nemission-line features - the introduction of \u03b1\u03bb as a free\nparameter allows an additional degree of freedom and\nenables a better fit to the emission lines and slope simultaneously. Due to this degeneracy between the slopes\nwithin the eigenspectra and \u03b1\u03bb , we do not interpret the\nlatter as the slope of the underlying quasar power-law\ncontinuum. The power-law parameter also helps account\nfor low-order spectro-photometric errors as well as dust\nextinction in the spectrum.\npipe\nThe redshift-correction factor, cz = \u03bbfit\nrest /\u03bbrest , translates the spectrum along the wavelength axis with respect\nto the rest wavelength given by the pipeline redshift,\nfit\n\u03bbpipe\nrest , to a best-fitting rest wavelength, \u03bbrest . It is required as the SDSS pipeline redshifts are not completely\naccurate (see, e.g., Hewett & Wild 2010). However, due\nto the asymmetry and velocity shifting of quasar emission\nlines at different redshifts, we do not necessarily interpret\n\n\f6\n\nLee et al.\nTABLE 1\nFree Parameters in MF-PCA Continuum Fits\n\nFit Parameter\n\nDescription\n\nf1280\ncz\n\u03b1\u03bb\nc1 * * * c8\naMF\nbMF\n\nFlux normalization, evaluated at \u03bbrest \u2248 1280\u00c5\nRedshift correction factor\nPower-law exponent\nPCA coefficients\nLinear mean-flux regulation coefficient\nQuadratic mean-flux regulation coefficient\n\ncz as a true redshift correction - it is merely an ad-hoc\nparameter to obtain the best-possible fit to the spectrum.\nThe full list of free parameters for our continuum-fitting\nprocedure shown in Table 1 (aMF and bMF are free parameters for the mean-flux regulation step, described in\n\u00a7 3.2).\nWe are now in a position to carry out the fitting procedure. First, the quasar spectrum is shifted to the quasar\nrestframe using the pipeline redshift, and normalized at\n\u03bbrest = 1275 \u2212 1285\u00c5. We then use the least-squares fitting routine MPFIT (Markwardt 2009) to find the bestfitting set of parameters, [cz , \u03b1\u03bb , cj ], given the spectrum\nand its noise. The initial fits from this procedure is represented by the black dashed lines in the examples shown\nin Figure 3.\nHowever, while the intrinsic quasar spectrum is generally well-defined redwards of Ly\u03b1 in the SDSS spectra,\nin many cases intervening metal absorption lines can be\nseen in the spectrum in the \u03bbrest \u2248 1216 \u2212 1600\u00c5 wavelength. To prevent these absorption features from biasing\nthe PCA fitting, we carry out a simple iterative procedure to mask these absorption lines: using the continuum, Cinit , obtained from the initial least-squares fit, we\nmask pixels in which f (\u03bb) \u2212 Cinit (\u03bb) < \u22122.5 \u03c3(\u03bb), where\nf (\u03bb) and \u03c3(\u03bb) are the observed spectrum and pipeline\nnoise, respectively. We then make a new PCA fit and\nrepeat this process until the fit converges. In Figure 3,\nthe final PCA fits, CPCA , are shown as black solid lines\nwhile the masked pixels are denoted by crosses.\nFrom Figure 3, we see that the least-squares PCA\nfitting procedure generally works well, even with noisy\n(S/N \u223c few) spectra. The fit to the Ly\u03b1 \u03bb1216 emission\nline is sometimes imperfect, but unsurprising considering that the fitted range (\u03bbrest = 1216 \u2212 1600\u00c5) only\ntakes partial account of the line. Comparing the initial\n(dashed-line) and final (solid-line) fits in Figure 3, we see\nthat the red-side metal absorption lines usually have little effect on the fits, but in certain cases (e.g. Figure 3(b)\nand (c)) absorption line-masking noticeably improves the\nfit.\nWe use the absolute flux error to quantify the goodness\nof the PCA fits redwards of Ly\u03b1:\nR \u03bbmax CPCA (\u03bb)\u2212f \u0303(\u03bb)\nd\u03bb\n \u0303\n\u03bbmin\nf(\u03bb)\n,\n(4)\n|\u03b4F | =\nR \u03bbmax\nd\u03bb\n\u03bbmin\nwhere CPCA (\u03bb) is the fitted continuum and f \u0303(\u03bb) is the\nobserved spectrum smoothed by a 15-pixel boxcar, to\navoid biasing |\u03b4F | in noisy spectra. \u03bbmax = 1600\u00c5 and\n\u03bbmin = 1225\u00c5 represents the range over which we calculate |\u03b4F |.\nThe distribution of |\u03b4F | in the fitted data is shown in\n\nFigure 5, which plots |\u03b4F | against the red-side signal-tonoise per pixel, S/Nred , for PCA fits to a subset of the\nSDSS spectra as well as the mock spectra described in\n\u00a7 4.\nFigure 5 provides a useful diagnostic for the quality of\nthe PCA fits on the SDSS spectra. We expect the fits to\nthe mock spectra (green crosses) to represent the case in\nwhich the PCA eigenspectra describe the spectra nearly\nperfectly (see \u00a7 4), therefore they typically have smaller\nvalues of |\u03b4F | than the real spectra. Clearly, the SDSS\nspectra with large |\u03b4F | are most likely bad fits, but note\nthat the presence of metal absorption lines and other artifacts in the real data can bias |\u03b4F | to larger values even\nfor good fits (we did not mask any lines when calculating\n|\u03b4F |, as our metal-masking algorithm is rudimentary and\nsometimes masks legitimate pixels).\nIn practice, we carry out the PCA fitting procedure using the two different PCA templates described in \u00a7 2.2,\nthen for each SDSS spectrum we select the fit which\ngives the lower value of |\u03b4F |. Fits with |\u03b4F | values under\nthe 95th percentile of those from the mock spectra (red\nline in Figure 5 are then automatically considered good\nfits, while the rest are visually inspected and flagged for\ngoodness-of-fit on the red-side of the spectrum - approximately 90% of the spectra were adequately fit. The\nspectra which are not well-fitted by our procedure consist\nmostly of objects which have strong absorption systems\nat \u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5, such as metal absorption from DLAs\nand weak BAL quasars. An example of this is shown\nin Fig. 4a. There are also quasars with unusual spectral\nshapes which are not represented in the template spectra\ndescribed in \u00a7 2.2, such as quasars with weak emission\nlines (Fig. 4b).\nThe spectra now have been had PCA fits carried out\non them redwards of Ly\u03b1, but the predicted continuum,\nCPCA , extends bluewards of Ly\u03b1 (\u03bbrest < 1216\u00c5). For\nthe objects which are well-fitted on the red-side of the\nspectrum, we expect the predicted continua to provide\na reasonable prediction for the shape of the Ly\u03b1 continuum bluewards of Ly\u03b1, but the overall amplitude is uncertain due to the EUV-NUV power-law break described\nin the Introduction. We now turn to the next fitting\nstep, mean-flux regulation, to constrain the continuum\namplitude.\n3.2. Mean-Flux Regulation\n\nIn the least-squares PCA fitting step described in the\nprevious section, we have hitherto used no information\nbluewards of the quasar Ly\u03b1 emission line due to the\nabsorption from the Ly\u03b1 forest. However, since the absorption redshift at any point in the Ly\u03b1 forest is known\n(zabs = \u03bbobs /1216\u00c5\u22121), the average absorption averaged\nover each sightline can be used to constrain the predicted\ncontinuum. In this section, we will describe the use of\nthe mean-flux evolution of the Ly\u03b1 forest, hF i(z), to regulate the amplitude and slope of the predicted PCA continuum. We refer to this as the 'mean-flux regulation'\nstep.\nUsing the PCA continuum CPCA (\u03bbrest ) fitted to the\nobserved spectrum, we first extract the Ly\u03b1 forest transmission F init (\u03bbrest ) = f (\u03bb)/CPCA (\u03bbrest ) in the range\n\u03bbrest = 1041\u00c5\u2212 1185\u00c5. The extracted Ly\u03b1 forest is then\ninit\ndivided into bins, and the mean-flux, F\u0304bin\n(\u03bbbin ), is eval-\n\n\fMF-PCA Continuum Fitting to SDSS Ly\u03b1 Forest\n(a)\n\n7\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 4.- Examples of SDSS quasar spectra in which the PCA fitting procedure fails to provide a reasonable fit redwards of the quasar\nLy\u03b1 line.

The red line traces the 95th percentile of |\u03b4F | in\nthe mock spectra; SDSS spectra with |\u03b4F | smaller than this are\nautomatically considered good fits, while spectra above this line\nare visually inspected to ensure fit quality.\n\nuated for each bin, where \u03bbbin = [1070\u00c5, 1110\u00c5, 1050\u00c5]\nare the central rest wavelengths of each bin.\nWe now introduce a quadratic fitting function bluewards of a pivot point, \u03bbrest = 1280\u00c5, to obtain the\nmean-flux regulated continuum:\nCMF (\u03bbrest ) = CPCA (\u03bbrest )\n\u00d7(1 + aMF \u03bb\u0302rest + bMF \u03bb\u03022rest ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere aMF and bMF are free parameters for the fit, while\n\u03bb\u0302rest \u2261 \u03bbrest /1280\u00c5\u2212 1. Note that for the lower redshifts\n(zQSO . 2.4) in which only a limited portion of the Ly\u03b1\nforest is accessible, we use only the linear parameter,\naMF , in order to avoid over-fitting.\nWe again use least-squares-fitting to find the values\nof aMF and bMF which provide the best fit between the\n\nwhere \u03c4eff (z) = hF i(z).\nIn principle, the errors in the continuum fit should now\nbe at the level of a few percent, arising from some combination of the large-scale variance in the Ly\u03b1 forest and\nerrors in the fitting. In the next section, we will use mock\nspectra to quantify the level of continuum errors in the\nMF-PCA technique.\n4. TESTS ON MOCK SPECTRA\n\nThe errors in the MF-PCA continuum fitting technique\ncan be tested by carrying the above procedure on noisy\nmock spectra, and comparing the fitted continuum with\nthe 'true' continuum which is known by construction.\nThis testing process is also useful to check our algorithm\nfor bugs and efficiency. In this section, we will describe\nthe process of generating realistic mock spectra, and the\nquantitative results of the MF-PCA technique. We will\nalso make a comparison between MF-PCA and the common technique of using the mean quasar continuum as\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest continum.\n4.1. Generating Mock Spectra\nThe first step is to create synthetic quasar spectra from\nPCA eigenspectra, by making Gaussian realizations of\nthe PCA weights, cj , (see Equation 3) in the manner\ndescribed in Suzuki (2006). Note that this is an approximation, as the distribution of the weights may not\nbe fully Gaussian, but it does generate realistic-looking\n\n\f8\n\nLee et al.\n\nFig. 6.- Tests of the MF-PCA continuum prediction procedure on mock spectra seeded with noise from real SDSS spectra. In each plot,\nwe show the noisy mock spectrum (orange); pipeline noise (green) used to generate the mock spectrum; CPCA , the least-squares PCA fit to\n\u03bbrest = 1216\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5 (black solid line); and CMF , mean-flux regulated continuum fit at \u03bbrest < 1280\u00c5 (black dashed-line). The vertical\ndashed line indicates \u03bbrest = 1216\u00c5 in the quasar restframe. h|\u03b4C|i is the RMS continuum-fitting error evaluated over the Ly\u03b1 forest for\neach individual spectrum.\n\nquasar spectra. In principle, the PCA eigenspectra used\nto generate the mock spectra and those used in the fitting procedure should be separate but drawn from the\nsame distribution. While we do have two sets of PCA\neigenspectra (\u00a7 2.2), they represent quasars with different luminosities. Hence, we do not expect to be able use\neigenspectra from P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) to fit mock spectra generated from the Suzuki et al. (2005) eigenspectra,\nand vice versa. However, since we only use 8 principal\ncomponents in our PCA fitting step (\u00a7 3.1), we can generate our mock spectra using 10 principal components in\norder to increase the uncertainty in the fitting. Nevertheless, the tests described in this section will primarily\napply to the limit in which the PCA eigenspectra are a\ngood representation of the fitted quasars, which we have\nargued (\u00a7 2.2) is a reasonable assumption.\nTherefore, we generate mock quasar spectra in the\nspectral range \u03bbrest = 1020\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5, using 10 principal components from the Suzuki et al. (2005) eigenspectra. Next, we need to introduce Ly\u03b1 forest absorption\nto the mock spectra. For this, we use the publicly avail-\n\nable Roadrunner Ly\u03b1 forest simulations6 of White et al.\n(2010). These are N-body simulations with a box size\nof (750 h\u22121 Mpc)3 and a grid scale of 187.5 h\u22121 kpc, in\nwhich the Ly\u03b1 forest flux was derived using the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation. The simulations were\nreleased in the form of 22,500 Ly\u03b1 forest sightlines per\nbox, output at redshifts zbox \u2248 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, and 2.75.\nFor a given mock quasar at redshift zQSO , we select\nthe simulation box with the closest redshift, zbox . Using Equation 6, we then re-normalize the mean-flux of\nthe box to hF i(z = (1 + zQSO )1100/1216 \u2212 1), i.e. using\nthe absorber redshift corresponding to the \u03bbrest = 1100\u00c5\nin the quasar spectrum. We choose to normalize the\nmean-flux across the entire box rather than in individual\nspectra in order to preserve the variance across different\nlines-of-sight, which is a source of error in the MF-PCA\ncontinuum fitting. A random line-of-sight is selected\nfrom the set of skewers, and the transmitted flux in each\npixel, Fi , is rescaled to Fi\u2032 = Fi \u00d7 hF i(zabs,i )/hF i(z =\n(1 + zQSO )1100/1216 \u2212 1), where zabs,i is the absorber\n6\n\nhttp://mwhite.berkeley.edu/BOSS/LyA/RoadRunner/\n\n\fMF-PCA Continuum Fitting to SDSS Ly\u03b1 Forest\nredshift corresponding to the pixel. This introduces redshift evolution of the mean flux, hF i(z), within the individual sightlines which had hitherto had a fixed value of\nhF i.\nThe simulated Ly\u03b1 forest absorption is added to the\nmock quasar spectrum in \u03bbrest < 1216\u00c5, and smoothed\nto the approximate SDSS resolution, R = 2000. Gaussian noise is then added to the mock spectrum using the\nnoise array of a randomly-chosen SDSS quasar spectrum\nwith the same zQSO and S/N. The mock spectra are then\nrun through the MF-PCA fitting process described above\nto obtain continuum fits.\n4.2. MF-PCA Continuum-Fitting on Mock Spectra\nIn Figure 6, we show several examples of the mock\nspectra and the fitted MF-PCA continua. The first thing\nto note is that mock spectra look realistic. They look\nsimilar to the real spectra shown in Figure 3, apart from\nthe lack of metal absorption redwards of the Ly\u03b1 emission line.\nAs described in \u00a7 3.1, we use the mock spectra as\na benchmark for the PCA fit quality on the red-side\n(\u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5) of the spectra - we automatically accept all fits with absolute flux error, |\u03b4F |, less than the\n95th percentile of the |\u03b4F | distribution measured from\nthe mocks (Figure 5). For the fits with larger |\u03b4F | that\nrequire visual inspection, we use the mocks as a visual\nguide for what constitutes a good fit.\nIt is clear from Figure 6 that the mean-flux regulated continuum, CMF , is a corrected version of the\nPCA fit, CPCA . In several cases, the initial PCA\ncontinuum,CPCA , appeared unphysical (e.g. dipping below the peaks of the forest). These were rectified by the\nmean-flux regulated fit, CMF .\nWe can place this on a more quantitative footing by\ncomparing the fitted continua, Cfit , to the 'true' continua, Ctrue , which is known by construction in the mock\nspectra. We define the continuum fitting residual,\n\n\u03b4C(\u03bbrest ) \u2261\n\nCfit (\u03bbrest )\n\u2212 1.\nCtrue (\u03bbrest )\n\n(7)\n\nWe can then carry out MF-PCA fits on large numbers\nof mock spectra to obtain statistics on the continuum\nfitting errors as a function of S/N and quasar redshift.\nIn Figure 7 we show the residuals from fitting 1000 mock\nspectra in two bins of signal-to-noise, S/N, and quasar\nredshift, zQSO . The orange lines show the residuals as a\nfunction of wavelength, \u03b4C(\u03bbrest ), binned into restframe\n1\u00c5 bins from a subset of 100 mocks. The dashed lines\nshow the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 dispersion of the residuals estimated from\nbootstrap resampling at each 1\u00c5 wavelength bin, while\nthe dotted lines show the 10th and 90th percentile at\neach wavelength. Figure 7(a) represents one of the worst\ncase scenarios - the signal-to-noise (S/N = 2 \u2212 4) is low\nat \u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5, making it difficult to obtain a good fit\nfor the continuum shape. At the same time, the redshift\nis sufficiently low that the Ly\u03b1 forest occupies the blue\nend \u03bbobs . 4000\u00c5 of the SDSS spectrographs where the\nsignal-to-noise deteriorates rapidly with decreasing wavelength. This causes a large scatter in the flux of Ly\u03b1 forest even when averaged over large segments, introducing\nmore errors to the mean flux regulation process.\n\n9\n\nAt moderate signal-to-noise (S/N = 6 \u2212 10, Figure 7(b)), the situation is significantly better. The 1 \u2212 \u03c3\ndispersion of the fit residuals are well under 10%, and\n6 \u2212 7% in the central portion of the fitted region. Many\nof the residuals are flat to within a few percent across\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest region, indicating that the PCA-fitting\nhas successfully accounted for the shape of the Ly\u03b1 continuum. About one-tenth of the fitted continua are badly\nfit, with badly-predicted continuum shapes and/or residuals greater than 10%.\nWe also calculate the mean bias, \u03b4C(\u03bbrest ), of the residuals in Figure 7. Averaged over \u223c 103 spectra, the MFPCA technique have a low bias of < 1%, although this\nnot include any systematics errors in the hF i(z) measurement used to constrain the overall continuum levels.\nTo quantify the overall fit quality on each mock spectrum, we use the RMS of the continuum residuals evaluated over \u03bbrest = 1041 \u2212 1185\u00c5:\n\uf8eeR \u0010\n\uf8f91/2\n\u00112\nCfit (\u03bbrest )\nd\u03bbrest \uf8fa\nCtrue (\u03bbrest ) \u2212 1\n\uf8ef\nR\n(\u03b4C)rms \u2261 \uf8f0\n\uf8fb . (8)\nd\u03bbrest\nFigure 8 shows the median RMS error from runs of 1000\nmocks as a function of redshift, for 4 different S/N bins.\nAt lower redshifts, the RMS error is relatively high for\nthe low-S/N spectra because the mean flux regulation is\naffected by the increased noise levels near the blue-end of\nthe SDSS spectra at \u03bbobs \u223c 4000\u00c5. As the observed Ly\u03b1\nforest region clears the blue end of the spectra, the RMS\nerror decreases to a minimum at zQSO \u2248 3.0. It then\nrises with redshift at zQSO > 3 due to the increasing\nvariance in the Ly\u03b1 forest, which adds to the error in\nthe mean-flux regulation. At fixed redshift, the median\nRMS decreases with S/N as might be expected. Below\nzQSO \u2248 3, it drops below 5% RMS for moderate signalto-noise (S/N \u223c 5) and asymptotes to \u223c 3 \u2212 4% RMS for\nthe S/N > 10 spectra.\nTo estimate the contribution from various sources of\nerror in the MF-PCA fitting, we also carried out the\nmean-flux regulation directly on the simulated Ly\u03b1 forest skewers without introducing a quasar continuum, or\nadding pixel noise. In other words, we directly fit the\nfunction Eq. 5 to the mean flux evaluated over 3 bins\nin each skewer. The RMS error in the continuum from\nthis estimate is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 8. For\nzQSO = 2.3 quasars, the RMS error contribution from\nLy\u03b1 forest variance is about 1.5% ; this increases to 4%\nat zQSO = 4. This suggests that even in the limit of\nhigh-S/N, errors in the continuum shape from PCA fitting contributes 1 \u2212 2% to the overall RMS continuum\nerror.\n4.3. Power-law+Mean Continuum Fitting\n\nTo place the above results in context, we carry out\nanother set of continuum fits on the mock spectra, using\nthe continuum model\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u03bbrest\n, (9)\nCmean (\u03bbrest ) = f1280 \u00d7 \u03bc(\u03bbrest ) \u00d7\n1280\u00c5\nin which the mean spectrum, \u03bc(\u03bbrest ), is multiplied with\na power-law, \u03bbrest \u221d \u03bb\u2212\u03b1\nrest , and f1280 is the flux normal-\n\n\f10\n\nLee et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 7.- Continuum fitting errors from MF-PCA fitting on mock Ly\u03b1 forest spectra, plotted as a function of quasar restframe wavelength\nfor (a) 2 \u2264 S/N < 4 and 2.5 \u2264 zQSO \u2264 2.7; (b) 6 \u2264 S/N < 10 and 2.9 \u2264 zQSO \u2264 3.1. In both cases, 1000 mock spectra were generated and\ncontinuum-fitted. The grey lines represent a random subset of continuum-fitting errors from 100 fits. We also show the overall bias (solid\nline), the dispersion (dashed line), and the 10th/90th percentiles (dotted line) of the errors as a function of wavelength. Note that Figure (a)\nrepresents a regime with the worst MF-PCA continua, and is truncated at the lower-limit of the observed spectral range, \u03bbobs = 3840\u00c5.\n\nFig. 8.- Median RMS continuum fitting error, h|\u03b4C|i, from\nfitting 1000 mock spectra, calculated for different redshifts, zQSO ,\nand signal-to-noise, S/N, on the red-side of the spectrum. The\nrise in the low-S/N values of h|\u03b4C|i at low-zQSO is due to the\nincrease noise levels at the blue end (\u03bbobs . 4000\u00c5) of the SDSS\nspectra, while the overall increase in h|\u03b4C|i with redshift is due\nto the increase in the variance of the Ly\u03b1 forest. The dashed-line\nshows the RMS fitting error in the absence of continuum structure\nand noise.\n\nization at \u03bbrest = 1280\u00c5. Both f1280 and \u03b1 are determined separately for each quasar, with the power-law fitted to the regions near \u03bbrest = 1280\u00c5 and \u03bbrest = 1450\u00c5.\nThis model is highly similar to that implemented in\nSlosar et al. (2011).\nIn Figure 9, we show the continuum residuals from\nCmean , as a function of rest-wavelength in the Ly\u03b1\nforest region. Comparing this plot with Figure 7(b),\nwhich show the MF-PCA fitting residuals from the same\n[S/N, zQSO ] bin, it is clear that MF-PCA dramatically\nreduces the range of fitting errors by a factor of 3. Indeed, the Cmean (\u03bbrest ) residuals are significantly larger\nthan even the worst-case scenario for MF-PCA continua,\nrepresented in Figure 7(a). The significant bias (black\n\nFig. 9.- Same as Figure 7(b), but for the power-law+mean\nspectrum continua, Cmean (Equation 9), fit to 1000 mock spectra.\nNote the larger errors in comparison with the MF-PCA residuals.\n\nline) of the residuals from Cmean (\u03bbrest ) is puzzling at\nfirst glance, as one would expect to recover the mean\nspectrum (and hence no bias) when averaging over large\nnumbers of spectra. We suspect this bias most likely\ndue to an asymmetry in the distribution of power-law\nspectral indices in quasars (see Desjacques et al. 2007),\nwhich we have not accounted for in our mock spectra.\nHowever, this does not affect the scatter and shape of\nthe continua, which is the present quantity of interest.\nThe median RMS error from the continua shown in Figure 9 is (\u03b4C)rms = 0.13, which is worse than any of the\n[S/N, zQSO ] bins evaluated in Figure 8.\n4.4. Residual Continuum Power\nThe RMS continuum fitting error is not the most important quantity for studies of the 1-dimensional Ly\u03b1\nforest flux power spectrum,\nZ \u221e\nPF (k) = 2\u03c0\n\u03b4(k)\u03b4 \u2217 (k)dk,\n(10)\n0\n\n\fMF-PCA Continuum Fitting to SDSS Ly\u03b1 Forest\n\nFig. 10.- Mean power spectrum of 1000 residuals from continuum fitting on mock spectra, calculated using power-law+mean\ncontinuum fitting Cmean on S/N = 6\u221210 spectra (black dot-dashed\nlines), and mean-flux regulated PCA fitting CMF on spectra with\nS/N = 2 \u2212 4 (yellow dashed lines) and S/N = 6 \u2212 10 (blue solid\nlines). The upper abscissa shows the wave number in units of comoving distance, evaluated at z = 2.75 and assuming a flat \u039bCDM\ncosmology with h = 0.7 and \u03a9m 0.28. The black vertical dot-dotdot-dashed line indicates the location of the first BAO peak for\nthis cosmology. The error bars show the error on the mean estimated from bootstrap resampling. The red solid line denotes the\ncontinuum-limited scale of k \u2265 0.0014 km\u22121 s, the smallest k at\nwhich McDonald et al. (2006) measured PF (k). Red arrows indicate the points at which the CMF fits reach the same continuumlimited power as Cmean . The vertical red-dotted and red-dashed\nlines indicate the new continuum-limited scale for the S/N = 2 \u2212 4\nand S/N = 6 \u2212 10 MF-PCA fits, respectively.\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u2261 F/hF i \u2212 1, and k \u2261 2\u03c0/l is the Fourier\nwavenumber. Rather, it is the Fourier power from the\ncontinuum errors which is the troublesome systematic.\nFor example, in their measurement of PF (k) from SDSS\ndata, McDonald et al. (2006) were limited to scales of\nk \u2265 0.0014 km\u22121s, corresponding to comoving distances\nof r . 50 h\u22121 Mpc or \u03bbrest . 18\u00c5 in the quasar restframe\nwavelength. This was due to the increasing influence of\ncontinuum power at large scales. It is therefore pertinent to investigate the amount of residual Fourier power\nintroduced by the various continuum fitting methods.\nIn Figure 10, we show the mean power spectrum of the\ncontinuum residuals from 1000 mock spectra, \u03b4C(\u03bbrest ),\nfor the power-law+mean continuum method, Cmean , and\nMF-PCA continuum fitting, CMF , shown for two signalto-noise bins. All the mock spectra had quasar redshifts in the range zQSO = 2.9 \u2212 3.1. All the residual\npower-spectra have the same overall shape, with a bump\nat k \u2248 0.0005 km\u22121s corresponding to the weak emission lines in the intrinsic quasar spectrum at scales of\n\u03bbrest \u2248 50\u00c5. This is unsurprising, since imperfections in\nthe continuum fitting should give similarly-shaped residuals. At fixed k, the amplitudes follow the same pattern\nwe had already discussed above: the residual power from\nMF-PCA fitting is significantly lower than that from\nthe power-law+mean continuum fits. Even with noisy\nS/N \u2248 3 spectra, CMF continuum fitting reduces the\nresidual power by \u223c 30% compared to Cmean fitted to\nhigher-S/N spectra.\nIn their measurement of PF (k) from SDSS data,\nMcDonald et al. (2006) had used a mean continuum\nshape for all their spectra, which is similar to Cmean\n\n11\n\nexcept that they did not fit for the individual powerlaw indices. Using this method, McDonald et al. (2006)\nfound that residual continuum power started becoming\nproblematic at scales greater than k = 0.0014 km\u22121s, indicated by the solid red vertical line in Figure 10. We\nthus estimate the residual power in Cmean at this scale at\nwhich continuum power interferes with PF (k) measurements. We can then look for the points in the CMF residual power spectra with the same limiting power (red arrows in Figure 10). Note that this assumes that the Ly\u03b1\nforest power is constant whereas the Ly\u03b1 forest power\ndecreases with scale, but the change is gradual. For our\nrough estimates, we can approximate it as constant over\nsmall logarithmic intervals.\nThe corresponding limiting values of k (red dotted\nlines) are significantly smaller than for Cmean . This suggests that MF-PCA continuum fitting could allow the\nLy\u03b1 forest flux power spectrum to be measured at larger\nscales than previously possible. For S/N = 6 \u2212 10 spectra, the lower k-limit is now k = 0.0007 km\u22121s. This\ncorresponds to a doubling of the accessible comoving\nscales: r = 2\u03c0/k \u2248 90 h\u22121 Mpc at z = 2.75 compared\nto r \u2248 45 h\u22121 Mpc in the McDonald et al. (2006) study,\nwhere these distances are calculated assuming a standard flat \u039bCDM cosmology with h = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.28\nand with a w = \u22121 cosmological constant. Even for\nnoisy (S/N = 2 \u2212 4) spectra, the accessible scale has\nbeen increased significantly to r \u2248 65 h\u22121 Mpc.\nThe new continuum-limited scales approach the \u223c\n100 h\u22121 Mpc baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at\nmoderate signal-to-noise (S/N & 6). In Fig. 10, the black\nvertical dot-dot-dot-dashed line indicates the wavenumber of first BAO peak, calculated from the prescription\nin Eisenstein & Hu (1998). Even though future BAO\nmeasurements in the Ly\u03b1 forest are expected to be carried out in 3-dimensions (McDonald & Eisenstein 2007),\nthe increase in accessible modes along the lines-of-sight\nwill improve the robustness and precision of the measurements.\n5. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION\n5.1. Public Release of Continua\n\nWe have carried out mean-flux regulated PCA (MFPCA) continuum fitting on 12,069 quasar spectra from\nthe SDSS DR7 catalog. The continua in the spectra\nrange 1030\u00c5 < \u03bbrest < 1600\u00c5 have been made publicly\navailable, and can be downloaded via anonymous FTP7 .\nThe IDL fitting code took \u223c 0.5 seconds per spectrum\n(including file input/output) on a single processor core of\na 3.0 GHz Intel Quad Core desktop with 2 GB of RAM,\nallowing the entire SDSS DR7 Ly\u03b1 forest sample to be\nfitted in about two hours.\nSince we expect the MF-PCA technique to provide a\ngood continuum fit only when there is a good PCA fit\nredwards of the quasar Ly\u03b1 line, the fitted spectra have\nbeen visually inspected to verify the fit quality in the\n\u03bbrest = 1216\u00c5 \u2212 1600\u00c5 wavelength region. Approximately 89% of the spectra had reasonable PCA fits, and\nthese have been flagged as such in the publicly available continua, although we recommend that users of the\ncontinua should make their own cuts on the fit quality.\n7\n\nftp.astro.princeton.edu/lee/continua/\n\n\f12\n\nLee et al.\n\nApproximately 30% of the spectra were better fitted by\nthe low-redshift Suzuki et al. (2005) templates, while the\nrest were better fitted by the P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) templates. This is qualitatively as expected, since there is\ngreater overlap by the P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) templates in\nthe luminosity distribution of the SDSS quasars.\nFrom the mock spectra analysis of the fit quality in\n\u00a7 4, we have estimated the continuum fitting error at\neach pixel within the Ly\u03b1 forest, as a function of quasar\nredshift and spectral signal-to-noise. However, the errors have significant covariances, therefore it would be\ntoo unwieldy to provide the full error estimates for each\nspectrum although we can provide them upon request.\nIt is worth noting that although we have made a choice\non the mean-flux of the Ly\u03b1 forest in our fits (Eq 6), it is\nstraightforward for users to rescale each fitted continuum\nto their favorite hF i(z).\n5.2. Empirical Tests of Fit Quality\n\nWhile we have studied the performance of MF-PCA\ncontinuum fitting on mock spectra in \u00a7 4, it is difficult\nto empirically constrain the quality of the fits. One\npossibility is to compare a small subset of the data\nwith high-resolution, high-S/N spectra of the same objects. However, even with high-resolution spectra, it\nis questionable whether there are sufficient transmission\npeaks in the forest to adequately constrain the continuum\nshape; Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re et al. (2008) have shown that accurate fitting of the quasar continuum is difficult beyond\nz \u2248 2.5. Furthermore, most high-resolution spectra are\nobtained from echelle spectrographs with uncertain spectrophotometry, so it would be tricky to directly compare\nquasar sightlines which have been observed in both SDSS\nand high-resolution echelle spectrographs.\nHowever, it is possible to get a sense of the efficacy\nof our MF-PCA continua by stacking large numbers of\nspectra. This cancels out the Ly\u03b1 forest power from individual sightlines, and allows the underlying continuum\nshape to be seen, albeit lowered due to the mean Ly\u03b1\nabsorption.\nRecall that the PCA coefficients, cj , parametrize the\nshape of the quasar spectra. Therefore, if our continuumfitting technique works, quasars with similar cj measured\nfrom \u03bbrest > 1216\u00c5 should have similar-looking continua\nwithin the Ly\u03b1 forest region. Thanks to the large number\nof spectra in our SDSS sample, it is possible to stack\n\u223c 102 spectra with similar values of cj to recover the\ncollective shape of their Ly\u03b1 forest continua.\nWe can select subsamples of quasars based on their\nvalues of \u03c31 \u2261 c1 /\u03bb1 and \u03c32 \u2261 c2 /\u03bb2 , where \u03bb1 = 7.563\nand \u03bb2 = 3.604 are the standard deviations of c1 and\nc2 , respectively, in the low-redshift HST eigenspectra\n(Suzuki 2006). These two principal components account\nfor approximately 80% of the total variance in the lowredshift quasar templates. We limit ourselves to spectra with S/N > 3 pixel\u22121 , and which have been visually\ninspected to be decent fits redwards of \u03bbrest = 1216\u00c5.\nWe also select quasars with zQSO > 2.6 in order to\nensure reasonably complete coverage of the Ly\u03b1 forest.\nWithin a subsample, each spectrum is first normalized\nnear \u03bbrest = 1280\u00c5 and rebinned into a common wavelength grid with \u2206\u03bbrest = 1\u00c5 bins before being stacked.\nThe same procedure is carried out on the MF-PCA con-\n\ntinuum fitted to each spectrum, to obtain a mean MFPCA continuum for the subsample.\nIn Fig. 11 we show 4 subsamples from our SDSS sample with different [\u03c31 , \u03c32 ] with respect to the low-redshift\nSuzuki et al. (2005) eigenspectra. Redwards of 1216\u00c5,\nwe see that the least-squared PCA procedure generally\ndoes a good job of fitting the emission lines, although\nthere are inaccuracies in fitting N V \u03bb1240 and Si II\n\u03bb1306. Bluewards of 1216\u00c5, the stacked spectrum appears to have a similar shape to the fitted continua, although the overall flux level is depressed due to the mean\nLy\u03b1 absorption.\nWe can make a more direct comparison between the\nstacked spectra and the fitted Ly\u03b1 forest continua by\ncorrecting each observed Ly\u03b1 forest pixel by its mean\nflux (using Equation 6) before stacking. The mean-flux\ncorrected Ly\u03b1 forest is shown as the disembodied red\nline in Fig. 11. It is gratifying to see that the stacked\nMF-PCA continua generally agrees well with the stacked\nLy\u03b1 forest spectra. Our technique can clearly account\nfor the diversity in quasar continua: spectra with clear\nemission-line features (Fig 11a) and those with smooth\ncontinua (Fig 11b) are well differentiated. Because we\nhave corrected each Ly\u03b1 forest pixel by the same meanflux (Eq. 6) which we have used to carry out the MF-PCA\nfits, we expect the amplitude of the corrected Ly\u03b1 forest stacks, in \u03bbrest = 1041\u00c5 \u2212 1185\u00c5, to match those of\nthe stacked MF-PCA continua, but the tilt and shape of\nthe continuum bears testament to the success of the technique. In addition, since the MF-PCA continua shown in\nFig 11 were a subset which used the Suzuki et al. (2005)\nquasar templates, this suggests that it was appropriate\nto use low-redshift templates to fit some of the zQSO & 2\nSDSS spectra.\n5.3. Conclusions\n\nWe have introduced mean-flux regulated PCA (MFPCA) continuum fitting, a new technique for predicting the Ly\u03b1 forest continuum in low-S/N spectra. In\ntests on mock spectra, we have found that MF-PCA can\npredict the continuum at the 8% RMS level in SDSS\nspectra with S/N \u223c 2 at z = 2.5, and < 5% RMS in\nS/N & 5 spectra. This is a significant improvement over\nthe \u223c 15% RMS continuum errors previously achievable\nin low-S/N spectra. We are making available MF-PCA\ncontinuum fits for 12,069 Ly\u03b1 forest spectra from the\nSDSS DR7 quasar catalog. The MF-PCA technique also\nsignificantly reduces the Fourier power from continuumfitting residuals by a factor of a few in comparison with\ndividing by a mean continuum. This will allow a concomitant increase in the accessible scales for Ly\u03b1 forest\nflux power spectrum measurements.\nThis improved continuum-fitting accuracy will significantly increase the value of low-S/N Ly\u03b1 forest data.\nFor example, the ongoing Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) will obtain Ly\u03b1 forest spectra from\n\u223c 150, 000 quasars at zQSO & 2, with the aim of measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation feature in the Ly\u03b1\nforest absorption across different quasar sightlines. The\ntypical signal-to-noise (S/N \u223c 2) of BOSS spectra will be\neven lower than that of SDSS (S/N \u223c 4), therefore we\nexpect the MF-PCA technique to contribute significantly\nto the utility of the BOSS data.\n\n\fMF-PCA Continuum Fitting to SDSS Ly\u03b1 Forest\n\n13\n\nFig. 11.- Stacked SDSS Ly\u03b1 forest spectra (black) and similarly-stacked MF-PCA continuum fits, plotted for narrow selections of the\nfirst two PCA eigenvalues, \u03c31 and \u03c32 . The red curve shows the 1041\u00c5 < \u03bbrest < 1185 Ly\u03b1 forest region of the spectra which have been\ncorrected by the mean-flux prior to stacking. The agreement of the MF-PCA stacks with the mean-flux corrected Ly\u03b1 forest stacks show\nthat the MF-PCA is doing a good job of predicting the shape of the Ly\u03b1 forest continuum.\n\n\f14\n\nLee et al.\n\nThere are several ways in which the current work could\nbe improved. The Suzuki et al. (2005) PCA templates\nwith which we have used to fit some of the spectra were\nderived from a low-redshift quasar sample which may\nnot be a perfect descriptor of the SDSS data (although\nthe test in \u00a7 5 shows that it does a reasonable job). In\naddition, while the zQSO \u223c 3 P\u00e2ris et al. (2011) templates were indeed obtained from SDSS quasars, they\nused a high-luminosity subset which are not representative of the full SDSS luminosity distribution. Furthermore, the hand-fitting technique which they had used to\nobtain continua from these spectra cannot be used for\nthe lower-luminosity (and hence lower-S/N) quasars.\nHowever, with a large data set such as SDSS or BOSS,\nit is possible to regard the Ly\u03b1 forest absorption within\nindividual spectra as a noise term which cancels out with\nsufficiently large numbers of template spectra. This will\nallow new eigenspectra to be generated from the data\nitself, although each individual spectrum will need to be\ncorrected by its mean flux before being included in the\neigenspectrum solution. In the near future, we will work\non this technique to generate new eigenspectra from the\nBOSS data.\nThe other issue with the MF-PCA fitting is that it\nrequires an assumed mean-flux, hF i(z) for the Ly\u03b1 forest.\nThis is not ideal, as the evolution of the mean-flux is an\nimportant observable of the Ly\u03b1 forest. This could in\nprinciple be overcome by solving simultaneously for the\nmean-flux of the Ly\u03b1 forest and the continuum-fitting\nparameters for the individual spectra, using maximumlikelihood techniques. This would allow large Ly\u03b1 forest\ndata sets to be continuum-fitted and studied in a fully\n\nself-consistent fashion.\nThe authors thank Michael Strauss and Xavier\nProchaska for useful discussions and comments, and to\nIs\u00e2belle Paris for providing the data from her mean-flux\nmeasurement.\nFunding for the SDSS and SDSS-II has been provided by the Alfred P.
