Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) comes up, it seems we need\na fare share of luck to directly produce BSM particles, be it of supersymmetry, technicolour, compactified extra\ndimensions, models with extra chiral/vector fermions, gauge bosons or scalars, or of some other extensions of\nthe Standard Model (SM). On the other hand, radiative corrections induced by such new particles may affect\nlow-energy observables.\nThe effects of specific models of BSM on low-energy data, particularly data from B factories, have been extensively discussed in the literature. Indeed, there is some justification for such an enthusiasm. It seems that the\ndata is not exactly in harmony with the SM expectations. There are two caveats: the error bars are still large\nenough, and the low-energy dynamics is not very well known. The second point can be tackled by looking at\nthe mixing-induced CP asymmetry data, where hadronic uncertainties mostly cancel out. Unfortunately, only\nfor a limited number of channels such asymmetries have been measured. It is hoped that in near future we may\nhave a situation where the error in the data will be dominated by theoretical uncertainties. We can only hope\nthat the experimental numbers that we now have will stand the test of time and proceed accordingly.\nIf one looks carefully, the anomalous results seem to be concentrated in the b \u2192 ss\u0304s decay sector. One can\nsay that this is apparently so because we do not really understand the penguin dynamics, but the radiative\ndecay b \u2192 s\u03b3 is well explained within the SM. This has prompted a number of analyses of the nonleptonic\ndata, particularly those of B \u2192 \u03c6K, in the context of specific new physics models, like different versions of\nsupersymmetry [3], and non-supersymmetric models like extra Z \u2032 , more Higgs doublets, extra fermions, etc.\n[4]. A good guide about the anomaly is the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) website [1] (also the UTfit\ncollaboration [2] performed some model-independent new physics analyses). The value of sin(2\u03b2), as extracted\nfrom all charmonium modes, is 0.725 \u00b1 0.037 (this is consistent with the value obtained from CKM fits without\nsuperimposing the direct CP asymmetry measurement data), while it drops down to 0.43 \u00b1 0.07 for b \u2192 ss\u0304s\nmodes. Both sets are internally consistent as far as exclusive modes are concerned. However, there is a second\nimportant factor: the branching ratios (BR) for B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K and B \u2192 \u03b7K \u2217 channels are abnormally large, at\n1\n\n\fleast if we do not take into account the a posteriori explanations of a large charm content of \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 or the\nsignificant gluonic contributions. Some of the papers in [3] also deal with this BR enhancement problem. The\ndata is shown in table 1.\nStill, the results are not inconsistent with the SM. If we look at table 1, it is seen that sin(2\u03b2) extracted from\nB \u2192 \u03c6KS is consistent with that extracted from the charmonium modes at less than 2\u03c3. The BR data is never\na clear indicator; e.g., in the factorisation model [5] the B \u2192 \u03c6K BR is quite unstable with the variation of Nc ,\nthe effective number of colours, and one can always take help from SM dynamics beyond naive valence quark\nmodel to explain the BRs of \u03b7(\u2032 ) modes. Only the value of sin(2\u03b2) from B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K is away from the charmonium\nvalue by almost 3\u03c3. It is imperative to have more precise values of the CP asymmetries shown in table 1, and\nalso accurate CP asymmetries from channels like B \u2192 3KS or B \u2192 K + K \u2212 KS [6].\nLet us assume that the data, as it is, will stand the test of time. Even then this does not mean that only\nthe b \u2192 ss\u0304s channel is affected by BSM physics. Indeed, it will be very difficult to find a model which affects\nonly one single channel. In particular, if at least two of the final state quarks are left-handed, then the SU(2)\nconjugate channel, b \u2192 cc\u0304s, will be there. The deciding factor is the SM contribution: for the former, it is a\npenguin contribution, whereas for the latter, it is a tree-level one, so the BSM amplitude has less chance to\ncompete and show up in b \u2192 cc\u0304s decays.\nIn this letter we perform a model-independent study of all b \u2192 ss\u0304s channels that have shown signs of anomaly.\nThere are a number of works in the literature [7, 8] that stress the need for such a model-independent analysis.\nWe investigate what type of Lorentz structure of the four-Fermi interaction coming from the BSM physics can\nsimultaneously solve all the anomalies. For simplicity, we do not include tensor currents, but all other bilinear\ncovariants are taken into account. This serves as a testing ground for BSM models as far as their ability in\nexplaining the anomalous B decay results are concerned. We will also assume that the new physics, whatever\nit is, does not contribute significantly to B 0 \u2212 B 0 mixing; in particular, to the CP asymmetry prediction from\nthe B 0 \u2212 B 0 box diagram (e.g., minimal supersymmetry with perfect alignment, i.e., all flavour-changing \u03b4\nparameters set to zero).\nWe will show that it is impossible to find a simultaneous solution for all BRs and CP asymmetries with a\nhierarchical structure of new physics (i.e., only one Lorentz structure is numerically significant). The reason\nhas been explained in section 3. We find that it is necessary to have some dynamics within SM but beyond the\nnaive valence quark model (NVQM) to explain the BRs of the \u03b7(\u2032 ) modes. Even with such an assumption, we\nhave a fairly constrained parameter space, different for structurally different four-Fermi interactions, which can\nbe further tested in hadronic machines (now that BTeV has been cancelled, this essentially means LHC-B).\nTheoretically, a new Lorentz structure as discussed above should contribute to Bs \u2212 Bs mixing. This can\npotentially change the weak phase coming from the Bs \u2212 Bs box from the SM prediction of almost zero.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThis will directly affect the measured CP asymmeries in Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6, Bs \u2192 Ds+ Ds\u2212 , Bs \u2192 \u03b7 ( ) \u03b7 ( ) channels.\nUnfortunately, the allowed parameter space for new physics can contribute only marginally in Bs \u2212 Bs mixing;\nthe SM contribution, whose lower limit only exists, is too large. Thus, the effects can only be studied (hopefully)\nin a super-B factory, an e+ e\u2212 collider sitting on the \u03a5(5S) resonance.\nThe first two decay channels, i.e., Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and Bs \u2192 Ds+ Ds\u2212 will be further affected from BSM physics in\ndecay if an SU(2) partner b \u2192 cc\u0304s channel is present. However, we will show that this effect can be neglected.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nOn the other hand, the channels Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 or Bs \u2192 \u03b7 ( ) \u03b7 ( ) , controlled by b \u2192 ss\u0304s transition, should show\nmodification from the SM prediction on two grounds: BSM physics in mixing as well as in decay. These\npredictions will be quantitatively different for different Lorentz structures.\n\nII\n\nData, Theory, and New Physics\n\nThe relevant data, after Moriond 2005, is taken from the HFAG website [1] (updated April 2005) and is shown\nin table 1.\n2\n\n\fBR \u00d7106\n8.3+1.2\n\u22121.0\n18.7 \u00b1 1.7\n68.6 \u00b1 4.2\n< 7.6\n< 2.0\n9.03+0.65\n\u22120.63\n24.3+3.0\n\u22122.9\n70.8 \u00b1 3.4\n< 14\n2.6 \u00b1 0.5\n\nFinal state\n\u03c6KS\n\u03b7K 0\u2217\n\u03b7 \u2032 KS\n\u03b7 \u2032 K 0\u2217\n\u03b7KS\n\u03c6K +\n\u03b7K +\u2217\n\u03b7\u2032 K +\n\u03b7 \u2032 K +\u2217\n\u03b7K +\n\nsin(2\u03b2)\n0.34 \u00b1 0.20\n0.43 \u00b1 0.11\n\nAdir\nCP\n\u22120.04 \u00b1 0.17\n0.01 \u00b1 0.08\n\u22120.04 \u00b1 0.08\n\u22120.037 \u00b1 0.050\n\u22120.03+0.10\n\u22120.11\n\u22120.027 \u00b1 0.025\n0.25 \u00b1 0.14\n\nTable 1: Experimental data on b \u2192 ss\u0304s modes. For our convention of ACP , see text. The third column shows\nthe value of sin(2\u03b2) as extracted from mixing-induced CP asymmetry of the corresponding modes. The error\nbars are at 1\u03c3 confidence limit (CL); the upper limits are at 90% CL.\n\nThe theoretical numbers, particularly those for the BRs, have some inherent uncertainties that stem from lowenergy QCD. We use the numbers from the conventional factorisation model with Nc = 3 [5, 9]. However, one\nmay question the validity of such a simplified approach. Other models like QCD factorisation [10] or perturbative\nQCD [11, 12] differ in their predictions of the BRs for these modes. The reason for this difference is mainly\ntwofold: first, the form factors for the factorizable diagrams are different, and second, the nonfactorizable\ntopologies (like annihilation or emission) are given unequal importance in these models. A study shows that the\npredictions for the amplitudes vary at most by 20% (i.e., more than 40% variation in the BRs) for the Nc -stable\nmodes like \u03b7(\u2032 )K, while \u03c6K modes are rather unstable and the amplitude uncertainty can go up to 40%. Since\nthere is no concensus about which model one should use, we take the conventional factorisation numbers with\nan error margin of 20% in the amplitude level (and 40% for \u03c6K modes). This is just to take into account the\nvariation of predictions for different models and should not be confused with the variation of a model parameter,\nsay, Nc . The charm contribution in \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 is neglected to start with, since that is an a posteriori approach to\nfix the BRs with the experiment. However, we will soon see that one must entertain either the possibility of a\nsignificant charm content in these mesons or a large gluonic contribution, i.e., something beyond the NVQM,\nto satisfy the data even in the presence of new physics.\nThe CP asymmetries, particularly the mixing-induced ones that measure sin(2\u03b2), are more or less free from\ntheoretical uncertainties. We assume that charm and up penguins are negligible compared to the top penguin, so\nthat in the SM, B \u2192 \u03c6KS is essentially a one-amplitude process. (Again, one can assume some phenomenological\nvalues for these penguins which reproduce the CP asymmetry data, thereby alleviating the need for any new\nphysics.) The CP asymmetries are defined as\nACP =\n\n\u0393(B + /B 0 \u2192 f ) \u2212 \u0393(B \u2212 /B 0 \u2192 f \u0304)\n,\n\u0393(B + /B 0 \u2192 f ) + \u0393(B \u2212 /B 0 \u2192 f \u0304)\n\n(1)\n\nwhich differs in sign from the HFAG convention.

Note that f\u03b7s and f\u03b7s\u2032 are both large and of the same\norder of magnitude; this will be relevant for our future analysis.\nThe expressions for the SM amplitudes can be found in [5]. The regularisation scale is taken to be \u03bc = mb /2 \u2248 2.5\nGeV and the quark masses according to [5] (ms = 0.5 GeV, mu = md = 0.2 GeV). We use the Wilson coefficients\nevaluated for Nc = 3 at next-to-leading order (NLO). Considering the fact that we have considered some inherent\nuncertainty in the amplitudes, it is expected that the results will be more or less stable with the variation of\nNc . This is indeed found to be the case, but for more comments the reader is referred to the next section.\nWe discuss two different types of effective four-Fermi interactions coming from new physics:\n1. Scalar :\n2. Vector :\n\nLnew = hs ei\u03c6s (s\u0304\u03b1 (c1 + c2 \u03b35 )s\u03b1 ) (s\u0304\u03b2 (c3 + c4 \u03b35 )b\u03b2 ) ,\n\nLnew = hv ei\u03c6v (s\u0304\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc (c1 + c2 \u03b35 )s\u03b1 ) (s\u0304\u03b2 \u03b3\u03bc (c3 + c4 \u03b35 )b\u03b2 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nHere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are colour indices. The couplings hs,v are effective couplings, of dimension [M ]\u22122 , that one\nobtains by integrating out the new physics fields. They are assumed to be real and positive and the weak phase\ninformation is dumped in the quantities \u03c6s,v , which can vary in the range 0-2\u03c0. Note that they are effective\ncouplings at the weak scale, which one may obtain by incorporating all RG effects to the high-scale values of\nthem. The couplings c1 -c4 can take any values between \u22121 and 1; to keep the discussion simple, we will discuss\nonly four limiting cases:\n(i) (S + P ) \u00d7 (S + P ) [(V + A) \u00d7 (V + A)]\n\n(ii) (S + P ) \u00d7 (S \u2212 P ) [(V + A) \u00d7 (V \u2212 A)]\n(iii) (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S + P ) [(V \u2212 A) \u00d7 (V + A)]\n(iv) (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S \u2212 P ) [(V \u2212 A) \u00d7 (V \u2212 A)]\n\n: c1 = 1, c2 = 1, c3 = 1, c4 = 1;\n: c1 = 1, c2 = 1, c3 = 1, c4 = \u22121;\n: c1 = 1, c2 = \u22121, c3 = 1, c4 = 1;\n\n: c1 = 1, c2 = \u22121, c3 = 1, c4 = \u22121.\n\n(8)\n\nThis choice is preferred since the 1 \u2212 (+)\u03b35 projects out the weak doublet (singlet) quark field. For the doublet\nfields, to maintain gauge invariance, one must have an SU(2) partner interaction, e.g., s\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )s must be\naccompanied by c\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )c. No such argument holds for the singlet fields.\nWe have chosen the interaction in a singlet-singlet form under SU(3)c . The reason is simple: one can always\nmake a Fierz transformation to the local operator to get the octet-octet structure. Since no spin-2 mesons are\ninvolved, the transformations are particularly simple, as we can neglect the tensor terms.\nThe amplitudes for the various decay processes under consideration take the following form:\n(i) B \u2192 \u03c6K (the contributions are same for neutral and charged channels):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\niMs = ihs ei\u03c6s \u2212\n(c1 c3 \u2212 c2 c4 )A\u03c6 ,\n2Nc 2\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\n1\n1\n+\nc2 c4 A\u03c6 ,\niMv = ihv ei\u03c6v c1 c3 1 +\n2Nc\n2Nc\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere\nA\u03c6 = 2f\u03c6 m\u03c6 F0B\u2192K (m2\u03c6 )(\u01eb\u03c6 .pB ).\n\n(10)\n\n\u2032\n\n(ii) B \u2192 \u03b7 ( ) K (again, since there is no b \u2192 s\u016bu new physics (NP) contribution, charged and neutral channels\nare equally affected):\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n{(c2 c3 \u2212 c1 c4 ) + (c2 c3 + c1 c4 )R(P, b, s)} AP ,\niMs = \u2212ihs ei\u03c6s c2 c3 R(P, b, s) \u2212\n4Nc\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n((c2 c3 + c1 c4 ) \u2212 (c2 c3 \u2212 c1 c4 )R(P, b, s)) AP ,\n(11)\niMv = \u2212ihv ei\u03c6v c2 c3 +\n2Nc\nwhere\nR(P, b, s) = m2P /2ms (mb \u2212 ms )\n\n(12)\n\nAP = ifP (m2B \u2212 m2K )F0 (q 2 ), q = pB \u2212 pK .\n\n(13)\n\n\u2032\n\n(P = \u03b7, \u03b7 ) is the chiral enhancement factor, and\n\n\u2032\n\n(iii) B \u2192 \u03b7 ( ) K \u2217 : This follows a path similar to that discussed in (ii); however, only the axial-vector current\ncontributes, and the expression for AP looks slightly different:\nAP = 2mK \u2217 fP (\u01eb\u2217 .pB ) A0 (q 2 ).\n\n(14)\n\nThe chiral enhancement factor is given by S(P, b, s) = \u2212m2P /2ms (mb + ms ).\n\nIII\n\nResult\n350\n300\n\u03c6 s (deg.)\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nhs\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nFigure 1: Allowed parameter space for (S + P ) \u00d7 (S + P ) (lower red) and (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S \u2212 P ) (upper green) type\nnew physics at 2\u03c3 confidence level. The NP amplitude is to be multiplied by 10\u22128 .\nWe are now ready to discuss our results. They are shown in figures 1-3 as the allowed parameter spaces for\ndifferent Lorentz structures. The theoretical inputs have been summarised in the previous section, while the\nexperimental inputs (BRs and CP asymmetries) are all listed in table 1. Note that since we are interested only\nin the b \u2192 ss\u0304s transition, no other decay modes (like B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 or B \u2192 \u03c0K) have been taken into consideration.\nAlthough theoretically b \u2192 cc\u0304s modes (like B \u2192 J/\u03c8KS ) can be affected by the NP dynamics, the justification\nfor not including them in the analysis (which essentially means neglecting the NP amplitude in the decay) comes\na posteriori from the allowed amplitude of NP; this is so small compared to the tree-level Cabibbo-allowed SM\namplitude that one can safely disregard them.\nApart from the BRs and CP asymmetries, we also use the following results from [1]:\n5\n\n\f350\n300\n\u03c6 s (deg.)\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nhs\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nFigure 2: Allowed parameter space for (S + P ) \u00d7 (S \u2212 P ) (lower red) and (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S + P ) (upper green) type\nnew physics at 2\u03c3 confidence level.

All\nelements except Vub and Vtd are taken to be at their central values, while the full uncertainties for these two\nelements were incorporated. Again, due to the nature of the transition we are considering, this variation has\nalmost no effect.\nWith the expressions for BRs and CP asymmetries at hand, we perform a scan on the new physics (NP)\nparameters hs(v) and \u03c6s(v) . If we assume the NVQM to hold for the SM amplitude of B \u2192 \u03b7(\u2032 ), no common\nregion is found that satisfy all the data. This leads us to relax the BR constraint on the B \u2192 \u03b7(\u2032 ) channels, i.e.,\nwe assume that there is some SM dynamics beyond NVQM that generates a significant fraction of the amplitudes.\nWe also assume that this dynamics does not affect the CP asymmetry predictions, i.e., in the absence of NP,\nthe mixing-induced CP asymmetry in B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 KS should give sin(2\u03b2) and the direct CP asymmetries in all these\nchannels should vanish. The implementation of such a logic is performed by demanding that the contribution\nof the SM amplitude (NVQM part) plus that of the NP should not overshoot the experimental BRs (we find\nthat the beyond-NVQM dynamics should generate 30-40% of the decay amplitudes for these modes).\nOnly the regions that satisfy all constraints are shown in figures 1-3. For the scalar-type new physics, it can\nbe seen from figures 1 and 2 that all Lorentz structures are allowed when we take the experimental data at the\n2\u03c3 confidence level (CL), and their ranges are also in the same ballpark, but what differs is the weak phase.\nThis behaviour can easily be explained from the expressions of the NP amplitudes. Since we do not consider\nSU (2) conjugate channels, there is no way to discriminate, as far as the magnitudes are concerned, between\nSU (2) singlet and SU (2) doublet type interactions. We have not taken into account any strong phase difference\nbetween the NP amplitude and that of the SM; since the direct CP asymmetries are compatible with zero for\nalmost all channels (except B \u2192 \u03b7K by about 1\u03c3) this is not such a drastic assumption. We have checked that\nif we switch the strong phase on, even the B \u2192 \u03b7K CP asymmetry data can easily be accomodated. However,\nstrong phase differences cannot alleviate the necessity of introducing beyond-NVQM dynamics. If we take the\nexperimental errors at 1\u03c3 instead of 2\u03c3, only the (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S + P ) Lorentz structure remains allowed.\nIt is easy to understand why a simple NP model, without any contribution from beyond-NVQM dynamics,\ncannot explain the BR anomalies of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 modes. If we take only a b \u2192 ss\u0304s structure, the NP amplitude\ncontributes equally to both B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 and B \u2192 \u03b7, the only difference being the factors f\u03b7s and f\u03b7s\u2032 , which happen\nto be numerically close. Thus, if the NP amplitude is taken to be so high as to jack up the B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K BR to the\nexperimental value, it also raises the B \u2192 \u03b7K BR, which, however, is expected to be much smaller. The weak\nphase being fixed, we cannot even use the argument of constructive interference with the SM in one case and\ndestructive interference in the other. Thus, one is forced to admit the possibility of some SM dynamics beyond\nNVQM to explain these decays.\nFor the vector channels, only two Lorentz structures are allowed: (V + A) \u00d7 (V + A) and (V + A) \u00d7 (V \u2212 A),\nboth at 2\u03c3. The structure (V \u2212 A) \u00d7 (V + A) is a near miss; one can have a tiny overlap if the data (particularly\nthe CP asymmetry data) shifts a bit. Thus, it is not entirely prudent to rule out such a structure right now.\nHowever, if the experimental error bars are taken at 1\u03c3, all the allowed structures get ruled out. So, if the\nnumbers remain as they are, and the error bars get smaller, there will be only one possible Lorentz structure of\nnew physics. However, it is too early for such a prediction.\nThere are many well-motivated models that can generate such Lorentz structures. For example, minimal Supersymmetry can produce such vector-axial vector interactions, so does the model with extra gauge bosons in the\nleft-right symmetric models. R-parity violating supersymmetry can produce tree-level scalar type interactions.\n\n7\n\n\fWe have also checked the robustness of our results with the variation of the regularisation scale from \u03bc = mb /2\nto \u03bc = mb , and found it to be minimal. This is not unexpected since at the NLO level the scale dependence of\nthe Wilson coefficients becomes small. Finally, we have found that with the variation of Nc , some regions that\nare disallowed for Nc = 3 become allowed, but the result is more or less stable. For the scalar case, the results\nare absolutely Nc -stable (with a slight variation of the parameter space), when we vary Nc over the range 2 to\n4. All structures are allowed at 2\u03c3 CL but only one, (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S + P ), at 1\u03c3 CL. For Nc = \u221e, there are no\nallowed regions for any Lorentz structure, but that is only to be expected, since the B \u2192 \u03c6K NP amplitude\nvanishes at that limit.\nFor the vector case, with Nc = 2, the (V + A) \u00d7 (V + A) and the (V + A) \u00d7 (V \u2212 A) parameter spaces that we got\nfor Nc = 3 remain almost unchanged. The other two structures now get allowed over a tiny parameter space,\nnamely, hv < 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 and \u03c0 < \u03c6v < 2\u03c0. The reason is that with the lowering of Nc , the c2 -dependent term in\neq. (9) becomes more important. These results are true for 2\u03c3 CL. Only the first two remain at 1\u03c3 CL, over the\nrange 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 < hv < 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22128, 20\u25e6 < \u03c6v < 100\u25e6 (for (V + A) \u00d7 (V + A)), and 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 < hv < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22128,\n28\u25e6 < \u03c6v < 40\u25e6 (for (V + A) \u00d7 (V \u2212 A)). For Nc = 4 the results are almost identical with Nc = 3. The reason\nfor this is essentially the highly unstable nature of the B \u2192 \u03c6K BR with the variation of Nc (remember that\nthe variation of Nc is not the same as keeping Nc = 3 and taking different models of mesonic decays).\nThe result is stable with the variation of the other parameters (quark masses, form factors, CKM elements,\netc.).\nWe have not discussed here the polarisation data of B \u2192 V V (e.g., B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 ) channels. This will be treated\nin detail in a subsequent publication [15]. We would just like to point out that a scalar-type new physics may\nsignificantly reduce the longitudinally polarised fraction in the decay B \u2192 \u03c6K \u2217 [16] (for the experimental data\nsee [1]).\n\nIV\n\nSignatures in Bs System\n\nWe expect a large number of Bs decay channels to be probed in the hadronic machines. The first ones will\ninclude the gold-plated channel Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and Bs \u2192 Ds+ Ds\u2212 , both occurring through the tree-level decay\nb \u2192 cc\u0304s. In the SM, the mixing-induced CP asymmetry is expected to be very small. It has been pointed out\nthat new physics may introduce a nonzero CP asymmetry. There are two sources for that: (i) a new amplitude\nin the Bs \u2212 Bs mixing, with a nonzero weak phase, and (ii) a new contribution in the b \u2192 cc\u0304s decay. It may so\nhappen that both of them are present, and one needs a careful disentanglement of the two effects [17].\nIt can be shown that the new physics amplitude, given by hs(v) , is at most 10% compared to the corresponding\n\u221a\nSM quantity for b \u2192 cc\u0304s decay, namely, (GF / 2)Vcs Vcb . This, as far as the decay is concerned, NP effects will\nbe extremely hard, if not outright impossible, to detect. This limits our discussion to NP effects in Bs \u2212 Bs\nmixing only. Note that this is not true if we consider final states like \u03c6\u03c6 or \u03b7(\u2032 )\u03b7(\u2032 ) that proceed through b \u2192 ss\u0304s\ntransition.\nUnlike the decay, the calculation of the mixing amplitude depends on the precise structure of the NP Lagrangian,\nand one must perform a model-dependent study. Let us take the 1\u03c3 result, i.e., the only possible Lorentz\nstructure is (S \u2212 P ) \u00d7 (S + P ). One of the prime candidates to generate such a structure is R-parity violating\n\u2217\n(RPV) supersymmetry, which leads to a slepton-mediated amplitude proportional to \u03bb\u2032i22 \u03bb\u2032i23 . It can easily be\nseen that\n\u2217\n\u03bb\u2032 \u03bb\u2032\n(15)\nhs = \u2212 i22 2i23 .\n4m\u03bd\u0303i\nThus, to be consistent with the decay data, the magnitude of the product of these two \u03bb\u2032 s should be somewhere\nbetween 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 , and the associated weak phase between 0 and \u03c0 (the minus sign takes\ncare of a phase factor of exp(i\u03c0)) for a sneutrino mass of 100 GeV. The necessary formalism to evaluate RPV\ncontributions to the neutral meson mixing amplitude has been worked out in [18, 19]. Following these and\n8\n\n\ftaking \u2206Ms > 14.4 ps\u22121 one can calculate the effective CP-violation in Bs \u2212 Bs mixing.\nThe result, however, is not really encouraging. The reason is simple: the SM amplitude is too large,\nenhanced\nfrompthe B 0 \u2212 B 0 mixing amplitude by at least a factor of |Vts |2 /|Vtd |2 times \u03be 2 , where \u03be =\np\nfBs BBs /fBd BBd = 1.21 \u00b1 0.06 [20]. Furthermore, only a lower bound on the SM amplitude exists. The NP\namplitude with such a weak coupling as obtained from the decay fit cannot compete with the SM amplitude. We\nfind sin(2\u03b2s ), the effective phase from the Bs \u2212 Bs box, to be never greater than 0.1. Thus, it will be extremely\nunlikely to have a signal of this type of NP in Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 decay. Note that for such a Lorentz structure, there\nwill be a small but nonzero NP contribution to the b \u2192 cc\u0304s decay.\n\u2212\nOne can, of course, integrate out the left-handed squark field and get the decay Bs \u2192 l+\ni li (this is a strongly\nmodel-dependent statement and is true only in the context of RPV supersymmetry). For squarks at about\n300 GeV, leptonic decay widths of Bs will be greatly enhanced; in particular Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 will be close to the\nexperimental limit. (This set of couplings also enhances B \u2192 K (\u2217) l+ l\u2212 decay widths, but the constraints are\nmore model-dependent.) Thus, these channels will be worth watching out.\n\nAcknowledgements: A.K. thanks the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India, for the project\nSR/S2/HEP-15/2003.
