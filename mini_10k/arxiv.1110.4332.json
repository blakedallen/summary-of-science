FREEDMAN\n\nAbstract. J.H.C. Whitehead defined a map Jr : \u03c0r (SO) \u2192 \u03c0rs from the homotopy of\nthe special orthogonal group to the stable homotopy of spheres. Within a toy model\nwe show how the known computation for kernel(J) leads to nonlinear \u03c3-models with\nspherical source (space) and spherical target which admit false vacua separated from the\ntrue vacuum by an energy barrier. In this construction, the dimension of space must be\nat least 8 and the dimension of the \u03c3-model target at least 5.\n\n1. Introduction\nHomotopy theory and, in particular, K-theory have recently played a prominent role in\nboth condensed matter (CM) and high energy physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In CM applications, the\ndiscussion can often be reduced to the study of nonlinear \u03c3-models with symmetric space\ntargets [6]. In physical applications [7], there may be a potential function V on the target\nsymmetric space which can lead to distinct phases separated by an energy barrier. The\npurpose of this paper is to raise the possibility that even when there is no potential on the\ntarget symmetric space X, and the physical space B is as simple as possible - say a sphere\nor Euclidean space - the energy landscape on (smooth) maps M(B, X), maps f from the\nphysical space B to X, may have local minima, effectively creating sectors of false vacua.\nSimilarly, the space-time action of any field F : B \u00d7[0, 1] \u2192 X interpolating between distinct\nvacua may be large compared to fields F \u2032 remaining within a single vacuum sector. Such\nan F is a novel kind of instanton protected by the intrinsic inefficiency of any homotopy\nbetween distinct vacua. This may be contrasted with conventional instantons, for example\nin Yang-Mills theory, where the instanton results from a willfully inefficient null homotopy:\nF : S 3 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 S 4 \u223c\n= HP 1 \u2282 HP \u221e ,\nwhere F (S 3 \u00d7 0) = F (S 3 \u00d7 1) = \u2217, is chosen to have nonzero degree.\n\nI will explain why no such minima are expected to arise when dim B, dim X \u2264 2. After\nthis, as the dimension increases, little is known until we meet the example, f0 , defined\nafter equation (3). The focus of this paper is the surprisingly complex geometry necessarily\nassociated to any null homotopy of: f0 : B \u2192 X, where B = S 8 and X = S 5 , where f0 is a\n\nspecific field on an 8-dimensional spherical space taking values in the 5-dimensional sphere.\nOf course, there is the question of what energy functional to use for a general f : S 8 \u2192 S 5 .\n\nSomething like\n\nE(f ) = m\n\n(n\u22129)\n\n~\n\nZ\n\nS3\n\n\u221a\nd8 x g |\u2207f |n , 8 \u2264 n < \u221e,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICHAEL H. FREEDMAN\n\nwhere we have chosen units with c = 1 and m a constant with units of length, is a candidate\n(note that for n < 8, rescaling f toward a point x \u2208 S 8 by precomposing with a conformal\n\ntransformation with x a repelling fixed point makes E approach zero). Another possibility\nrelated to the choice n = \u221e is to let E be the Lipschitz constant of f (times a unit of\nenergy). These choices entail serious analytical difficulties which are circumvented here by\nchoosing a surrogate energy\n(1)\n\nEtop = max5\nx\u2208S\n\n7\nX\ni=0\n\n\u0001\nbi f \u22121 (x) ,\n\nf is presumed to be a smooth (C ) function and bi the ith Betti number, bi = rank \u021e \u2217 (X; R)\n\u221e\n\n(I have now dropped coupling constants and reference to units). We use the \u010cech cohomology\n\u021e i because it is appropriate for the nonregular point inverse images, which may be arbitrary\nclosed subsets of B.\nSimilarly, define the action Stop of a field F on space-time F := ft : S 8 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 S 5 by\n(2)\n\nStop (F ) = max5\nx\u2208S\n\n7\nX\ni=0\n\n\u0001\nbi F \u22121 (x) .\n\nBoth Etop and Stop are nonlocal - that is not integrated up from a locally defined quantity\n- but nevertheless seem to capture an essential feature of more physical Hamiltonians and\nLagrangians, respectively: maps of high energy (action) are generally those with complicated\npoint preimages (see Figure 1). With this definition, f0 has Etop (f0 ) = 2 and can be\ndeformed to the consant map f1 , that is the true vacuum, with Etop (f1 ) = 1, but during\nthe deformation we find that Etop (ft0 ) > 2 for some t0 \u2208 (0, 1). Thus Etop (ft0 ) is an energy\nbarrier between a false vacuum f0 and the true vacuum. Similarly, the action must be large\nfor any F interpolating between\nf0 and f1 : S\u0013\nfor paths staying\ntop (F ) \u2265 23 whereas\n\u0012\n\u0013 within\n\u0012\na vacua, for example Stop (F (y, t)) := f0 (y) = 2 and Stop (F (y, t)) := f1 (y) = 1, the\naction can be much smaller. I should emphasize that although topology is used to define\nEtop and Stop , these quantities are not homotopy invariants: as f0 is deformed, there will\nbe times when Etop (ft ) jumps; similarly for Stop (F ) if F were also deformed. What Etop\nand Stop do depend on is the topological complexity of the inverse images of points x \u2208 S 5 ,\nand these can jump whenever x is (transiently) a singular value.\n\nSo one may understand (Figure 1) how preimage complexity roughly encodes energy.\nThe surprise is that it may be necessary to increase the energy en route to decreasing it.\nIt would be as if in passing from Figure 1(a) to Figure 1(c) we had to go through Figure\n1(b).\nIf we distance ourselves from energy functionals, the basic idea of needing to \"pass over a\nsaddle\" on the way to lowering complexity can easily be illustrated using immersions. The\npath components of immersions I(S 1 , R2 ) are known to be indexed by the winding number\nin Z. It is easy (Figure 2) to find two immersions \u03b10 and \u03b11 with equal winding where\nthe \"complexity\" as measured by the number of multiple points, must increase during any\nregular homotopy \u03b1t , t \u2208 [0, 1], beyond the initial or final values.\n\n\fKERNEL(J) WARNS OF FALSE VACUA\n\n3\n\nStop = 13\n\n(a)\n\nStop = 3\n\n(b)\n\nhigh energy\n\n\u03b10\n\n\u03b11/4\n\nvery high energy\nFigure 1.\n\n\u03b11/2\n\n(c)\n\nlow energy\n\n\u03b13/4\n\n\u03b11\n\nFigure 2.\n\nUnlike Etop , the complexity in this example seems, in spirit, opposite to conventional\nenergy functionals: for example, a constant map, though not an immersion, would have\ninfinite multiplicity and hence high, not low, energy.\nIt is hoped that some insight can be gained even from the \"toy functionals\" Etop and\nStop . The key to the high dimensional example is the noninjectivity of Whitehead's Jhomomorphism from homotopy theory.\nIn summary, this paper is a message from topology to physics that fields might become\ntrapped in local minima for the energy of a nonlinear \u03c3-model, even when the space-time\nand the target space are as homogeneous as possible: both spheres. In our example, the\ndimensions are a bit high (except for string theorists) and the action is a toy. The challenge\nfor the reader is to determine if this same phenomenon can occur, or contrarywise is excluded,\nin more conventional, and perhaps lower dimensional, physical situations.\n\n2. The Example\nIn homotopy theory, the J-homomorphism is the map Jr : \u03c0r (SO) \u2192 \u03c0rs from the\nhomotopy of the special orthogonal group to the rth stable stem \u03c0rs (:= \u03c0r+d (S d ) for d >\nr + 1). We can interpret \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0r (SO) as a (stable) normal framing of the r-sphere S r\nand \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0rs can, by the Pontrjagin-Thom construction, be encoded as a normally framed r-\n\nmanifold M r . The Pontrjagin-Thom construction associates to \u03b2 : S r+d \u2192 S d , the preimage\nof a regular value \u2217 \u2208 S d , M r := \u03b2 \u22121 (\u2217). The normal bundle of M r in S r+d is framed by\n\npulling back the normal framing of \u2217 in S d . For d > r + 1, the stable normal cobordism\n\nclass of M r is equivalent to the homotopy class of \u03b2. In these terms, the J-homomorphism\nsimply includes spheres (with framed normal bundle) into manifolds (with framed normal\nbundle). It is known that Jr is injective unless r = 4n \u2212 1, n \u2265 1, and is the epimorphism\nJr : Z \u2192 Z4n/B2n , where B2n is the 2nth Bernoulli denominator. The first relevant images of\n\nJ are ImJ3 = Z24 , ImJ7 = Z240 , and ImJ9 = Z504 . The discussion requires only that Jr have\n\n\f4\n\nMICHAEL H. FREEDMAN\n\na kernel, so there are examples of exotic local minima for the obvious dimensional extension1\nof Etop (and Stop after crossing the source with [0, 1]) to maps S 2(4n\u22121)+2+i \u2192 S (4n\u22121)+2+i\n\nfor all n > 0 and i \u2265 0. Increasing n means going to a higher stable stem, and increasing\ni merely means suspending maps within that stable stem. I analyze the case n = 1 and\ni = 0. Nothing changes as i increases, however with increasing n the characteristic class\ncomputations are slightly different and more significantly a refinement coming from SeibergWitten theory is not present. In all cases, however, there is a similar energy barrier.\nThe homotopy group \u03c03 (SO) \u223c\n= Z is generated by the composition\n(3)\n\ndouble cover\ng : S3 \u223c\n= SU (2) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SO(3) \u0592\u2192 SO.\n\n24g is obtained by precomposing g with (\u03c6, \u03b81 ; \u03b82 ) 7\u2192 (24\u03c6, \u03b81 ; \u03b82 ) in spherical coordinates.\nThe map we study f0 : S 8 \u2192 S 5 may be defined by writing S 8 = S 3 \u2227 S 4 , where the\n\njoin sumbol \u2227 indicates the space of line segments \"joining\" the two factors: P \u2227 Q :=\nP \u00d7 Q \u00d7 [0, 1]/(p, q, 0) = (p, q \u2032 , 0) and (p, q, 1) \u2261 (p\u2032 , q, 1), for all p, p\u2032 \u2208 P and all q, q \u2032 \u2208 Q.\n\nIn these coordinates, f0 (S 3 ) = + and f0 (S 4 ) = \u2212, +(\u2212) the north (south) pole of S 5 . The\nnormal direction to S 3 in the join consists of a unit 5-disk Ds5 at every point s \u2208 S 3 and\n\nf0 wraps this Ds5 degree = one over S 5 by exponentiation. The only ambiguity is that we\nhave not yet said how Ds5 is identified with the unit disk in the target space T+ (S 5 ) as a\n\nfunction of s. When s = \u2217 \u2208 S 3 , the base point, say the identity of SU (2), the identification\nis an arbitrary isometry. For general s, precompose this arbitrary identification with 24g as\ndefined above, where SO acts on R5 through the intermediate SO(5), SO(3) \u2282 SO(5) \u2282 SO.\n\nBy inspecton, every point preimage of f0 is a 3-sphere except the preimage of the south\npole, which is a 4-sphere. Since\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f21, for i = 0 or n,\nrank \u021e i (S n ; R) =\n\uf8f30, otherwise,\n\nwe see that Stop (f0 ) = 2.\nSince it is known that J(24g) \u2243 f0 is homotopically trivial, f0 is homotopic to f1 , the\nconstant map S 8 \u2192 S 5 , taking each point of S 8 to the south pole \u2212 of S 5 . The only\nP7\nnonempty preimage of f1 is f1\u22121 (\u2212) = S 8 , so Etop (f1 ) = i=0 bi = 1. We now state:\nTheorem 1. If ft is a smooth family, F := ft : S 8 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 S 5 with f1 constant, then\nStop (F ) \u2265 23.\n\nProof. By Sard's theorem, the regular values on S 5 are an open dense set of full Lebesgue\nmeasure; let \u2217 \u2208 S 5 \\ (\u2212) be one. By the Inverse Function Theorem, F \u22121 (x) is a smooth,\n\nnormally framed 4-dimensional manifold M \u2282 S 8 \u00d7[0, 1], with \u2202M = S 3 \u2282 S 8 \u00d70. Cap M off\nwith a 4-disk to obtain a smooth, closed 4-maifold M\u0302 . Since M\u0302 has a normal framing away\nfrom a point, the normal characteristic classes w1 (\u03bdM\u0302 ) = w2 (\u03bdM\u0302 ) = 0. By the Whitney sum\nformula those tangential classes also vanish w1 (\u03c4M\u0302 ) = w2 (\u03c4M\u0302 ) = 0, so M\u0302 is spin. The first\n1Extend the definition of E\ntop and Stop given in equations (1) and (2) by extending the range of the\n\nsummations to (spatial dimension) \u2212 1.\n\n\fKERNEL(J) WARNS OF FALSE VACUA\n\n5\n\nobstruction to trivializing the normal frame bundle over M\u0302 is 24\u03b3 \u2208 H 4 (M\u0302 ; \u03c03 (SO)) \u223c\n= Z,\nwhere \u03b3 is a generator, \u03b3 = \u00b11 \u2208 Z. The first Pontrjagin class p1 (\u03c4M\u0302 ) is twice this\n\nobstruction, p1 (\u03c4M\u0302 ) = \u00b148\u03b3.

We may conclude that\n(6)\n\n7\nX\ni=0\n\nbi (M ) \u2265 17.\n\nSince Stop is defined as the maximal such sum over point preimages, Stop (F ) \u2265 17.\n\nBecause M\u0302 is smooth, spin, and 4-dimensional (since we are considering kernel J3 ), there\nis more refined information on the lower bound to b2 available from the Seiberg-Witten\nequations. It is known that M\u0302 must have b2 as large as that of the K3 surface, b2 (M\u0302 ) \u2265 22.\nThis follows from Furuta's \"10/8-theorem\" [9], and also from previous unpublished work of\nPeter Kronheimer. The estimate b2 (M\u0302 ) \u2265 22 is Donaldson's \"Theorem C\" in the special\ncase \u03c01 (M\u0302 ) = 0. This estimate implies Stop (F ) \u2265 23.\n\u0003\nThis is the Lagrangian result. The corresponding energy barrier is identified by the next\ntheorem.\nTheorem 2. If ft is a smooth family F := ft : S 8 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 S 5 with f0 as defined and\nf1 constant, then there exists a t \u2208 (0, 1) where Etop (ft ) \u2265 3. Recall Etop (f0 ) = 2 and\n\nEtop (f1 ) = 1.\n\nProof. Begin with the same (M, \u2202M ), \u2202M = S 3 , as in the proof of Theorem 1, except now\nrestrict M to be only the connected component containing \u2202M . Let h : M \u2192 [0, 1] be the\ninclusion M \u2282 S 8 \u00d7 [0, 1] followed by projection to the second factor. Intuitively, we may\n\nthink of h as a Morse function, but this cannot in fact be assumed. All we really know is\nh\u22121 (0) = \u2202M \u223c\n= S 3 , h\u22121 (1) = \u00d8, and h is smooth. A lower bound to\nb := max\n\nt\u2208[0,1]\n\n7\nX\n\nbi (h\u22121 (t))\n\ni=1\n\nis the lower bound to the barrier maxt\u2208[0,1] Etop (ft ) obtained by restricting attention to\npreimages of \u2217 \u2208 S 5 . We show b \u2265 3 by assuming for a contradiction that b = 2. Let\nx0 \u2208 [0, 1] be the maximum value for which h\u22121 (x) 6= \u00d8. Since we assumed M connected,\nfor all x \u2208 [0, x0 ] we have h\u22121 (x) 6= \u00d8. Let x1 \u2208 (0, x0 ) be any regular value for h. h\u22121 (x1 ) is\n\na smooth, closed 3-manifold so by the assumption b = 2, h\u22121 (x1 ) must be a real (equivalent\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL H. FREEDMAN\n\nrational) homology 3-sphere (otherwise its first and second Betti numbers would contribute\nto the sum).\nA key property of \u010cech cohomology is that it commutes with inverse limits. This will\nnow be used twice.\nLemma 3. For all x1 , x2 h-regular values in [0, x0 ], h\u22121 [x1 , x2 ] must have the real \u010cech cohomology\nof S 3 .\nProof. Suppose this fails for some [x1 , x2 ] pick an h-regular x3 \u2208 (x1 , x2 ) near (x1 + x2 )/2\n\nand write\n\nh\u22121 [x1 , x2 ] = h\u22121 [x1 , x3 ]\n\n[\n\nh\u22121 [x3 , x2 ].\n\nh\u22121 (x3 )\n\u22121\n\nSince h (x3 ) is normally collared (x3 is an h-regular value) we may use the usual MayerVietoris sequence to conclude that either h\u22121 [x1 , x3 ] or h\u22121 [x3 , x2 ] fails to have the real\n\u010cech cohomology of S 3 and the additional homology \u021e i (h\u22121 [x1 , x3 ]; R), i = 1, 2 restricts\nfrom \u021e i (h\u22121 [x1 , x2 ]; R) (for notational simplicity, write h\u22121 [x1 , x3 ] where h\u22121 [x3 , x2 ] could\ninstead occur).\nPicking a regular x4 \u2208 (x1 , x3 ) and near (x1 + x3 )/2, we may conclude similarly that\none of the pieces, say h\u22121 [x1 , x4 ], is not a real \u010cech cohomology S 3 . Proceeding in this\nway, find a sequence of nested intervals Ij each no more than, say, 60% the length of the\nprevious with the cohomology of h\u22121 (Ij ) containing a nontrivial subspace which restricts\nfrom \u021e i (h\u22121 [x1 , x2 ]; R), i = 1, 2. Taking inverse limits by letting z = \u2229\u221e\nj=1 Ij , we find\ni \u22121\n\u021e (h (z); R), i = 1, 2, also contains a nontrivial subspace restricting from \u021e i (h\u22121 [x1 , x2 ]),\ncontradicting b = 2.\n\n\u0003\n\nFrom the lemma, and once again applying the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to decompositions\ninverse to h-regular values, we conclude:\nLemma 4. For every regular value x1 \u2208 [0, x0 ], the natural map\n\u021e \u2217 (M ; R) \u2192 \u021e \u2217 (h\u22121 [x1 , x0 ]; R)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. Write\nM = h\u22121 [x1 , x0 ]\n\n[\n\nh\u22121 [0, x1 ]\n\nh\u22121 (x1 )\n\nand use Lemma 3 to recognize the second piece as a cohomology collar. Apply MayerVietoris along h\u22121 (x1 ).\n\n\u0003\n\nThe proof of Theorem 2 is now completed by a second passage to inverse limits. Write\n\\\nh\u22121 (x0 ) =\nh\u22121 [x1i , x0 ].\nh\u2212regular x1i\n\n\fKERNEL(J) WARNS OF FALSE VACUA\n\n7\n\nBy Lemma 4, the cohomology of each h\u22121 [x1i , x0 ] is given isomorphically by restriction from\n\u021e \u2217 (M ; R), so passing to limits, \u021e \u2217 (h\u22121 (x0 ); R) \u223c\n= \u021e \u2217 (M ; R) via inc\u2217 . But since b2 (M ) \u2265 22,\nthis implies b2 (h\u22121 (x0 )) \u2265 16. Thus 2 = b \u2265 b2 (h\u22121 (x0 )) + b0 (h\u22121 (x0 )) \u2265 22 + 1 = 23, a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\n\n3. Low Dimensions\nThe spaces of maps, M(S 1 , S 1 ), M(S 2 , S 1 ), and M(S 2 , S 2 ) probably do not hold any\nsurprises through in the last case there are some subtleties.\nWhen the target is S 1 , \"circular\" Morse theory can be used to steadily simplify maps\nuntil they are constant or in the S 1 \u2192 S 1 case, possibly a covering map. If we try to proceed\n\nto the case of maps S 3 \u2192 S 1 , M(S 3 , S 1 ), unknown issues are encountered. We may lift each\nf : S 3 \u2192 S 1 to f \u0303 : S 3 \u2192 R. If f \u0303 happens to be a \"self-indexing\" (critical values of higher\nindex are larger) a theorem of Waldhausen [10] shows that f \u0303 can be monotonely simplified to\n\nthe standard height function. But the existence of such monotone simplifications appears to\nbe open if f \u0303 is not self-indexing. If no simplifying path from f \u0303 is monotone, then the passage\nbetween a local minimum f \u0303 and global minimum would be analogous to the instanton we\nproduced between the vacua on S 8 .\nM(S 2 , S 2 ) is quite interesting. I would conjecture that there are no energy barriers:\nthat for reasonable choices of energy topological or otherwise, energy may be monotonically\nreduced until a cyclic branch cover is reached. This appears to be true for Etop , unsigned\narea, and harmonic map energy,\nZ\nd2 x |\u2207f |2 .\nS2\n\nIn fact, work of Topping [12] on harmonic map flow might be used in verifying such conjectures. The essential point is that because the target S 2 is positively curved, the local energy\ndensity |du|2 is not bounded by the usual Eells-Sampson maximal principle but instead\nmay exhibit a specific singularity called \"bubbling\" under harmonic map flow. Intuitively,\naccording to Topping, one should be able to run harmonic map flow until just before a\n\nsingularity and then pause to do a \u03c0-twist to prevent the flow from being caught on the\nsingularity and then resume the flow. The phenomenon of bubbling and the flow catching\non a singularity are certainly intrinsic since the Hopf map S 3 \u2192 S 2 can be regarded as\nan \"essential loop of degree zero maps S 2 \u2192 S 2 \"; only the flow catching the singularity\nprevents the loop from being contracted.\nProceeding by dimension, the techniques of [13] and [14] might be useful in bounding the\n\nheight of energy barriers within M(S 3 , S 2 ) if they in fact exist, but so far nothing is known.\nFor M(S 1 , S 3 ) (and, more generally, M(S m , S m+2 ) where m \u2265 1), the phenomenon of\nknotting implies the existence of Etop energy barriers. Furthermore, there is a physically\n\ninteresting conformally invariant energy associated to M(S 1 , S 3 ), [8], but it is unknown if\nit has local (but not global) minima within a given knot type. The gradient flow of this\nfunctional has been studied as a potential \"unknotting\" algorithm.\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL H. FREEDMAN\n\n4. Energy Barriers from Mathematical Logic\nOne surprising geometric output of mathematical logic is the existence of enormous energy barriers related to recognition problems. It was shown in the 1950's by Boone and\nNovikov that the triviality problem for finitely presented groups is undecideable. However\nthe Tietze theorem tells us that any two finite group presentations of the same group are\njoined by a finite string of four simple moves on presentations. The only way these two\nstatements can be compatible is:\nFact 5. The minimal number of Tietze moves required to reduce a presentation of the trivial\ngroup of total size n to the empty presentation must be a function f (n) which grows more\nrapidly than any recursive function.\nThis fact finds an even more geometric echo in work of Nabutosky and Weinberger [11].\nAn example is:\nFact 6. If one considers flat piecewise linear imbedding e : S 5 \u0592\u2192 R6 (or one may take\nS d \u2282 Rd+1 , for and d \u2265 5) consisting of n top dimensional simplices, then the degree of re-\n\nfinement f (n), which might be required before there is a piecewise linear isotopy to a convex\nimbedding econvex : S 5 \u0592\u2192 R6 , also grows faster than any recursive function.\n\nThe point is that any recursive growth rate would lead to an algorithm for recognizing 5-spheres, which is impossible. In attempting to recognize S 5 , the chief difficulty is\ndetermining the triviality of the fundamental group.\n5. Summary\nWe have shown in a toy model that even for nonlinear \u03c3-models whose range and domains\nare round spheres, false vacua and energy barriers can arise in the space of maps. The tool is\nJ.H.C. Whitehead's J-homomorphism, Jr : \u03c0r (SO) \u2192 \u03c0rs , from the homotopy of the special\northogonal group to the stable homotopy of spheres. Energy barriers and the instantons\nwhich cross them have diverse mathematical origins. Here the kernel of J has been used to\ndescribe a new class of barrier and instanton.\nReferences\n[1] Charles L. Kane and Eugene J.
