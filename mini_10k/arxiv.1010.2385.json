A positron from the irradiation source\n(the kinetic energy of positron produced by the most exploited isotope\n\n22\n\nNa [2] is less than\n\n0.5 MeV) passing through the sample creates a set of electrons, ions, radicals etc. losing\nits own energy. According to this model, at the beginning, each of the electrons caused by\nionization receives about 1 keV of the kinetic energy and is able to ionize other particles.\nFurther ionizations release 30-100 eV each and produce new charged particles which form\nclusters called spurs. If the energy of the positron decreases to about 1 keV, the spacings of\nionization spurs become less distant and overlap each other. Finally, the positron ends up in\nthe spreading cloud of ionized particles called blob with the energy lower than the ionization\nlevel. Further loss of the positron energy is transformed into vibrations of molecules and\nreaching thermalization energy the production of positronium atom arises as a profitable\nprocess.\nBefore the formation of positronium atom, a positron and an electron can leave the blob as a\nweakly interacting, delocalized system (pre-Ps) migrating to near free volume where it forms\nthe localized Ps. It is usually believed that at this time the whole population of Ps consists\nof p-Ps (spin S=0) and o-Ps (S=1) so the spin value for each particle is definite. Such a Ps\ncan annihilate in different ways: 1). the annihilation of p-Ps produces two gamma quanta,\n2). o-Ps produces three gamma quanta, 3). each Ps can annihilate with an electron captured\nfrom the environment (pick-off process). The probability of pick-off annihilation increases\nwith the local electron density and dominates in the case of annihilation in condensed matter. In the case of o-Ps the annihilation via pick-off is a two-quantum process. However,\nwhen the free volume is not reached, the positron annihilates as a quasi-free particle with\none of the electrons from the bulk (in particular those from the blob).\nThe most serviceable channel of the positron annihilation in a matter is long-living o-Ps\nwhich succeeded in reaching the free volume and annihilating by pick-off. In order to separate the long living component from the lifetime spectra, they have to be decomposed into\nelementary channels of annihilation (free positron annihilation, ortho- and para-Ps annihilation, etc.). The exponential form of annihilation for each channel is commonly assumed.\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nThe papers exploiting the blob model assume the definite value of spin number for pre-Ps\n(see positronium formation formulas in [3]). However, as the difference of energies of p-Ps\nand o-Ps states in the vacuum is about 8.4*10\u22124 eV [4], one can expect that the spin quantity\ncould change during the migration of a pre-Ps through the sample due to the intermolecular\ninteractions. It seems to be an oversimplification considering the definite spin value only,\ne.g. only o-pre-Ps. Instead, one should suppose that quasi-free Ps enters a free volume as\na superposition of para and ortho states and thus the spin number could not be a proper\nnumber for such initial state.\nThe value of Ps spin plays an important role in further analysis of Ps life. The annihilation\nof Ps, as an electromagnetic process, should obey the principle of conservation of the parity\n(here charge parity). This number for Ps in its ground state with the spin value S is\n\u03c0C = (\u22121)S whereas for n photons \u273f\u273f\nit is \u03c0C = (\u22121)n [5]. So until the spin number is\nwell defined, the system cannot decay with the emission of any definite n photons. Thus\nsupposing that Ps is the superposition of p-Ps and o-Ps after entering free volume, one\ncould expect that Ps can \"live\" in the free volume without giving an identifying decay signal\n(the number of photons is undefined) until it becomes p-Ps or o-Ps. This implies that one\ncannot decompose the PALS spectra simply into the exponential curves for p-Ps and o-Ps\nbecause the decay (two-quantum, for example) cannot start just after the birth of Ps. In\nour opinion, as long as there exists the population of Ps which is superposition of spins,\none should make the correction when decomposing the PALS spectra (the analysis of the\ncorrection way is not the subject of this paper but an example of applying the correction\nis shown in Appendix A). In this paper we show that it is expected to decohere Ps in the\np-Ps and o-Ps basis and we estimate the time of decoherence.\n\nIII.\n\nRATE OF DECOHERENCE. METHOD OF CALCULATION\n\nThe most convenient hamiltonian to consider the spin system interacting with the environment of spins (bath) is the Heisenberg hamiltonian [6] which is the phenomenological\nexpression incorporating an overlapping of wave functions of electrons of the system and an\nenvironment [7, 8]. The problem of the decoherence of certain spin systems, in particular\n3\n\n\fconsisting of a pair of particles interacting with the bath, was considered in [9\u201311] which\nsupport our calculation method.\nLet us consider the hamiltonian for interaction of Ps and the molecules from the wall of the\nfree volume\nH =J\n\nN +2\nh\u03042 X (2)\n\u03c3\u0304 \u25e6 \u03c3\u0304 (i) ,\n4 i=3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J- coupling constant, \u03c3 (2) - Pauli matrices for the electron in Ps, \u03c3 (i) - Pauli matrices\nfor the i-th (of N) electron from an environment, the sign \u25e6 denotes a scalar product.\nWe assume the existence of free volumes where Ps could live sufficiently long time1 . As\nthe environment we mean atoms which form the wall of the free volume. There is a wide\nspectrum of materials where such free volumes exist (molecular crystals or polymers). In all\nthese cases we suppose the atoms have certain electron density around (inside) the free volume. These valence electrons can interact with an electron from Ps by exchange interaction\nand resulting in the pick-off process of Ps.\nThe radii of the free volumes are in the range considered by the PALS method, i.e. from\nabout 1\u00c5 to hundreds of nanometers. The wavelength of valence electrons lies in the range\nof angstroms. So one can expect in general that Ps in the free volume interacts with the\nelectrons only momentarily. Generally, it is not obvious how many (N variable in this work)\nelectrons interact with Ps at the same time.\nSuppose the initial (just after the localization of Ps in the free volume) state of the whole\nsystem is \u03c10 \u2261 |\u03a80 ih\u03a80 |, where\n|\u03a80 i = |P si0\n\nN\n+2\nY\n\n|si i \u2261 |P si0|Si\n\n(2)\n\ni=3\n\nand\n1\n|P si0 = (|0, 0i + |1, \u22121i + |1, 0i + |1, +1i).\n(3)\n2\nThe ket |Si denotes the state of electrons of the environment whereas the numbers in the\nkets are spin s and its z-th projection sz for Ps, respectively. The latter equation expresses\nthe supposition that after many interactions with the bulk, Ps, just after entering into the\nfree volume, does not distinguish any particular Ps state.\n1\n\nOur model seems to be the most suitable for the solid state of matter. Probably the model could be\napplied also to the liquid state where, according to the recent knowledge, the bubbles are formed as free\nvolumes for Ps.\n\n4\n\n\fThe evolution in time gives the following expression for the whole state at the instant t\n\u03c1(t) = |\u03a8t ih\u03a8t |,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |\u03a8t i = e\u2212iHt/h\u0304 |\u03a80 i. For the positronium only, we calculate the state at t as\n\u03c1P s (t) = T renv [\u03c1(t)]\n\n(5)\n\ntracing over the environmental space.\nIn order to estimate the admixture of p-Ps in o-Ps at t we calculate some nondiagonal\nelements of \u03c1P s (t). More precisely, we consider the expression\nS(t) =\n\n+1\nX\n\n|hs = 0|\u03c1P s (t)|s = 1, sz i|2\n\n(6)\n\nsz =\u22121\n\nwhich is expected to collapse with time. The time when it reaches the minimum value we\ndefine as the time of the decoherence, Td .\nBecause of the mathematical problems with calculating the whole \u03c1(t) analytically, we made\nthe following simplification\n\u2212iHt/h\u0304\n\n|\u03a8t i = e\n\nn\nX\n1 itH j\n|\u03a80 i \u2243\n(\u2212\n) |\u03a80 i,\nj!\nh\u0304\nj=0\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the value n is fixed in this formula. This truncation at appropriate n still allows to\napproximate Td sufficiently for our aims (see Appendix B).\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe numerical calculations of (6) using (7) bring to the following statements:\n1. Indeed, one can observe the decrease of S(t) in the basis of p-Ps and o-Ps states (fig. 1),\nbut nondiagonal terms do not disappear completely and permanently.\n2. After the decrease of S(t) shown in figs 1 and 2 the oscillations were obtained2 which are\nconsistent with the results of calculations of decoherence for other complex systems in the\nspin bath [10, 11]. For N=2, Td is3 about 29 ps which means that the effect of the existence\n2\n\nOscillations are visible when calculated with sufficiently large n to obtain reliable outcomes for t > Td .\nHere maximally n=10 was applied which is enough to calculate reliably the evolution up to about 30 ps,\nso reliable oscillations are shown for the settings with enough small Td . As an example see the calculation\n\n3\n\nfor N =4, n=10 shown in fig. 2 and in figs 4 and 5\nThis result is not shown in any figure. Fig. 1 shows only a part of the whole S(t) for this N in order to\nshow that each nondiagonal term constituting S(t) collapses jointly but differently. The collapse of the\nwhole S(t) is shown in the next figures.\n\n5\n\n\f0.06\n\n\u00c8\u03a1@0,0;1,+1D 2\n\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0.00\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nt @psD\n\nFIG. 1. |\u03c1[0,0;1,+1] (t)|2 calculated for a random initial state vector (2).

The results are shown for N =1 (solid and dashed line,\nrespectively) and for N =4 (dotted and dashdotted line, respectively).\n\n6\n\n\fof the superposition of states lasts for the time detectable in PALS experiments and one\nshould take into account this effect when decomposing the PALS spectra. This statement\nwe consider as the most significant conclusion of this work.\n3. Higher orders of hamiltonian in the evolution operator do not affect substantially the\nvalue of the decoherence time, within the meaning that Td may vary by few picoseconds,\ni.e. the decoherence maintains always the same time scale (fig. 2). Figure 2 compares the\ncalculations with the 3-rd and the 10-th power of H as the highest order for a given N.\nSkipped parts of expansion of the evolution operator may change Td to some extent but\ntheir contribution is estimated in Appendix B. The aim of this paper is to estimate Td but\nnot to calculate the time evolution of the system at any time. The calculation is performed\nwith sufficient accuracy required to estimate the values of the Td for a given N. To calculate further evolution, next powers n are needed. For example, in order to extinguish\nthe increasing value of polynomials for the increasing time, t > Td , one needs to calculate\nnext powers of H in the expansion of the evolution operator which give higher powers of\npolynomials dominating at large values of t; thus one obtains oscillations at times larger\nthan Td instead of a rapid increase. Because the omitted terms of expansion may shift S(t)\nfor larger values of time, these terms may be more appropriate correction of Td for slow\ndecoherence (small number of electrons in the bath giving larger Td ).\n4. Decoherence time depends on a coupling constant J, which was set assuming that the\ninteraction energy of Ps and the electrons from the wall is about 10\u22124 eV (this is the energy\nwhich could convert ortho and para states and cause the initial superposition state in the\nbulk. Such a value of energy for the interaction of Ps in the free volume is reasonable\nonly for some specific cases, e.g. when ortho-para conversion takes place. This process is\ncharacteristic only for specific substances [12]). If the energy of the interaction is smaller,\none can expect that the decoherence time increases (e.g. if the interaction energy is set to\n10\u22125 eV then Td \u223c150 ps for N=3 instead of Td =18 ps as estimated above).\n5. The value of Td decreases with the number N of electrons in the environment reaching\nthe asymptotic value 12.2 ps (fig. 3).\n6. If one assumes in the numerical calculations the magnetization of the medium (all spins\nin the same direction), like paramagnetics at extremally low temperatures, one obtains the\nsuppression of the decoherence: it makes Td shorter for a given N and the minimum of\nS(t) becomes shallower, the shallower the greater is N.

In the case of magnetization the\nminimum is shallower4 . Furthermore, fig. 5 shows S(t) for different N for magnetization.\nOne can see that for greater N one obtains shallower minima.\nCalculations concerning magnetization were performed when all spins are situated along\ndifferent direction from that we considered Ps state. The result is shown in fig. 4. A systematic study of Td dependence on the direction of electron spins was not performed.\nThe effect of inhibiting the decoherence in the presence of magnetization along the z-axis\nis for us a new one and we regard it as a hypothesis to be proved. The situation resembles\nthe Ps eigenstates in the magnetic field \u2013 it is known that in the case of external magnetic\nfields the eigenstates of respective hamiltonian are those which are mixtures of p-Ps and\no-Ps. Here supposing the magnetization of the sample one introduces a magnetic field. For\nthis case the superposition of p-Ps and o-Ps seems to be maintained (which is indicated by\nthe shallow minimum).\nThe case of the magnetization presented above cannot be treated as one for the ferromag4\n\nWe decided to compare in this figure an averaged vector representing the state without magnetization\nwith the state with magnetization where all spins of the environment are 'up'. The reason for averaging is\nthat particular states of the environment differentiate the state of the whole system to some considerable\nextent and the only way to compare the results with magnetization is to average them.\n\n9\n\n\fnetic sample. In ferromagnetic crystals Ps does not form. Such property of the bath may\nbe rather connected with those of some molecules with the magnetic moment.\n7. The Heisenberg hamiltonian leads to reasonable results in the case of positronium decoherence problem but it shows that the decoherence is not complete in the basis of p-Ps and\no-Ps (there exists at any time the population of Ps atoms in the superposition state). The\nresidue means that there exists at this time a Ps population with not well defined spin value\nor, in other words, not all Ps atoms are in the spin state. The probability to find such an\nundefined spin can be calculated as 1 \u2212 (|hp \u2212 P s|P s(t)i|2 + |ho \u2212 P s|P s(t)i|2) (it is neither\np-Ps nor o-Ps). The smaller is S(t) value at minimum, the more Ps have finally well defined\nspin.\nWe believe that the existence of the residue may be an artefact of the Heisenberg hamiltonian being the simplest way of treatment of the realistic case. We intend to follow the\ncalculations with a more complicated hamiltonian, where J is time dependent (Ps atom\ndoes approach to or goes away from the wall, so the interaction strength changes).\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur theoretical study of the decoherence of Ps in matter results in statement that cohered Ps transforms into the states with well defined spin and that the decoherence lasts\nenough time (picoseconds and more) to modify the positron lifetime spectra and momentum\ndistributions and should be taken into account when any interpretation of the results in\npositron studies is performed. We have shown the way of modification for formulas used for\nPALS spectra decomposition.\nThe time of the decoherence decrease exponentially with the number of electrons interacting\nwith Ps in the free volume of matter. We examined the influence of magnetization to be\nexpected on the process of the decoherence.\nOur calculations are consistent, according to the formalism, with the previous ones published for similar quantum systems and the results add the new aspect to the recent theory\nof Ps formation and its evolution in matter.\n10\n\n\fAppendix A:\n\nThe influence of hypothetical coherence of Ps on the PALS spectrum seems to be a\ncomplex problem which requires more study. As an example where this influence can be\nobserved we propose the following one.\nTo interpret the PALS spectra one considers the formula for coincidence (2- and 3- quantum)\nrate (N\u03b3 ) resulting from the formula (see also [3])\n\ndN\u03b3 \u223c \u2212dPe(\u03bbe ) \u2212 dSo(\u03bbe ) \u2212 dSp(\u03bbe ) \u2212 d(pP s)(\u03bbpP s) \u2212 d(oP s)(\u03bboP s) ,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere: Pe - amount of free positrons, Sp , So - the same for pre-para-Ps and pre-ortho-Ps, pP s,\noP s- amount of para- and ortho-Ps, respectively; \u03bbs are the decay rates for a particular type\nof particles.\nFurthermore, one assumes Pe , Sp , etc. obey the following equations\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndPe (t) = \u2212(\u03bbe + \u03bd)Pe (t)dt,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndSo (t) = 34 \u03bdPe (t)dt \u2212 (\u03bbe + K)So (t)dt,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nPe (0) = 1,\nSo (0) = 0,\n\nSp (0) = 0,\ndSp (t) = 14 \u03bdPe (t)dt \u2212 (\u03bbe + K)Sp (t)dt,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nd(oP s)(t) = K So (t)dt \u2212 \u03bboP s (oP s)(t)dt, (oP s)(0) = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3d(pP s)(t) = K S (t)dt \u2212 \u03bb (pP s)(t)dt, (pP s)(0) = 0,\np\npP s\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u03bd, \u03bbe , etc. are the constants describing creation and decay rates of each population.\nIf one considers an annihilation in matter where the pick-off process dominates, (A1) relates\nmainly to the 2-quantum process of annihilation and both (A1) and (A2) allow to calculate\nthe intensity of the annihilation rate for the set of particular channels (i.e. for Pe , (oP s),\netc.). The decomposition of PALS spectra is a direct consequence of the use of formulas\nabove.\nIf one supposes the existence of the coherence of the states, one does not distinguish the spin\nvalue for pre-Ps and one assumes the existence of Ps (and also pre-Ps) in the superposition\n11\n\n\fstate, which annihilates with the rate \u03bbM . So, one can replace (A2) and (A1) by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndPe (t) = \u2212(\u03bbe + \u03bd)Pe (t)dt,\nPe (0) = 1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2dS(t) = \u03bdPe (t)dt \u2212 (\u03bbe + K)S(t)dt,\nS(0) = 0,\n\n(A3)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nd(oP s)(t) = K S(t)dt \u2212 \u03bboP s (oP s)(t)dt, (oP s)(0) = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3d(pP s)(t) = K S(t)dt \u2212 \u03bbpP s (pP s)(t)dt, (pP s)(0) = 0\n\nand\n\ndN\u03b3 \u223c \u2212dPe(\u03bbe ) \u2212 dS (\u03bbe ) \u2212 d(MS)(\u03bbM S ) \u2212 d(pP s)(\u03bbpP s ) \u2212 d(oP s)(\u03bboP s) \u2212 d(MP s)(\u03bbM P s ) . (A4)\nThe formula (A4) is not a simple replacement of (A1) because the last term in it describes\nthe decays where the number of photons per one annihilation act is not fixed and, for\nexample, 3 quantum decay cannot be neglected here.\n\nAppendix B:\n\nThe H n operator can be written as\nn\n\nH =(\n\nN\n+2\nX\np=3\n\n\u03c3\n\n(2)\n\n(p) n\n\n\u25e6\u03c3 ) =\n\nn-fold\nXsum\n\n\u03c3 (2) \u25e6 \u03c3 (p) * \u03c3 (2) \u25e6 \u03c3 (s) * . . . .\n\n(B1)\n\np,s,t,...\n\nEach superscript changes in the range (3, N + 2), so we have N n different terms with the\nP\n(p)\n(2)\nfixed value of indices. Because \u03c3 (2) \u25e6 \u03c3 (p) = 3i=1 \u03c3i * \u03c3i we have 3n different values of each\n\nterm summed in (B1) (for fixed p, s, t, . . . ). Each of such terms can give maximally the\nvalue 1 on any state5 so the resultant coefficient related to the n-th power of hamiltonian in\n\n(7) is \u05d0/n! * (\u2212iJh\u0304/4 * t)n , where \u05d0 = (3 N)n . Substituting the assumed value of J into this\ncoefficient we can see the contribution of the n-th term as a function of t. This contribution\nfor fixed t=10 ps and t=20 ps (the region of Td for several N) is shown in figure 6.\nIf one knows the contribution of skipped terms in the evolution operator at any t one can\nestimate the expected shift of minimum (Td ) of polynomial we obtained from truncation at\nsmaller n and that one expected when more accurate calculations could be performed. For\ndoing so, see Appendix C.\n5\n\n(p)\n\nWe assumed a very coarse approximation: if one of \u03c3i\n\n(p)\n\ngave 1 in the extreme case, then none of \u03c3j\n\nfor\n\ni 6= j could reach this value. In spite of this such extreme value is applied for simplicity. Because of this\nsimplification the approximation is overestimated.\n\n12\n\n\ft=10 ps\n\u00f2 \u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00ec\n\u00f4\n\nrelative contribution\n\n\u00e0\n\nae N=1\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec \u00f2 \u00e7\n\u00f4\n\n\u00f2\n\n0.8\n\n\u00e0 N=2\n\n0.6\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec N=3\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec \u00f2 \u00f4\n\n\u00f4\n\n0.4\n\nae\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u00f2 N=4\n\u00e7\n\n\u00f4\n\u00ec \u00f2\n\n\u00f4 N=5\n\n\u00e7 ae\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e7 N=10\n\u00f2 \u00f4\n\u00e7\n\u00e0 \u00ec \u00ec \u00f2 \u00f4 \u00f4\n\u00e7\nae ae\n\u00e0 ae\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00f2\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f2\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u00e7\n\n0.0\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e0\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec \u00f2 \u00f2 \u00f4\n\u00f4\n\u00f4\n\u00ec \u00ec\n\u00f2\n\u00f2\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0.6\n\nae N=1\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\u00f4\n\n\u00f4\n\u00e0\n\n0.4\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00f2\n\n\u00ec \u00f2\n\n\u00e0 N=2\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec N=3\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec\n\n\u00f2\n\n\u00e7 \u00f2 N=4\n\n\u00f4\n\nae\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec \u00f2 \u00f4\n\n\u00f2\n\n\u00f4\n\n\u00f4 N=5\n\u00e0\n\u00e7\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\nae\n\u00ec\n\u00e7\n\u00f4\nN=10\n\u00e7\n\u00e0\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\nae \u00e7\n\u00f4\n\u00e0 \u00e0 \u00ec \u00ec\n\u00f2\n\u00f4 \u00e7 \u00e7 \u00e7 \u00e7\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\nae ae ae ae\n\u00e0 ae\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00f2\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0 \u00ec\n\u00e0\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f4\n\u00f2\n\u00f2\n\u00e7\n\u00f2\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n14\n\n\u00ec\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\u00f4\n\n\u00e0 \u00f4\n\nae\n\u00e0\n\n\u00e0\n\n6\n\n\u00e7 \u00e7\n\nae \u00e0 \u00e0\n\n1.0\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00e7\n\n\u00ec\n0.8\n\nt=20 ps\n\n\u00e7\n\u00f4\n\nrelative contribution\n\n\u00e0\nae\n\n1.0\n\n0\n\n\u00ec\n\n5\n\n10\n\nn\n\n15\n\n20\n\nn\n\nFIG. 6. The boundary value of the absolute of n-th term (normalized to the maximal value) in (7)\nshowing its contribution at t=10 ps and t=20 ps to approximate the exact result in the region of\ncalculated Td .\nAppendix C:\n\nLet us suppose we have two polynomials f1 (t) =\n\nPk\n\ni\ni=0 ai t and f2 (t) =\n\nPk+c\ni=0\n\nbi ti which\n\nrepresent the S(t) function calculated when n=k and n=k+c respectively. Let single out\ns-th minimum of each polynomial, t1s , t2s , and relate it to those constituting Td . Suppose\nwe know (see Appendix B) amount of correction at any t given by c additional terms of\nexpansion of evolution operator; denote this surplus as \u03b4(t). This function \u03b4(t) can be\nexpressed as\n\u03b4(t) = f2 (t) \u2212 f1 (t) =\n\nk\nX\n\ni\n\n(bi \u2212 ai )t +\n\ni=0\n\nk+c\nX\n\nbi ti .\n\n(C1)\n\ni=k+1\n\nLet us construct the auxiliary function\nF = f2 (t) \u2212 f1 (t \u2212 \u2206t),\n\n(C2)\n\nwhich has, if t=t2s , a maximum for \u2206t=t2s \u2212 t1s .

For known values of t1s and ai one obtains an algebraic\nequation for t2s . In this way we can calculate the expected difference between known Td ,\nobtained for shorter expansion of the evolution operator, and that one if more accurate\ncalculations could be performed.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors want to thank Dr. T.
