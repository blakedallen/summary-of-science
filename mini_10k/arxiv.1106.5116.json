SOUKUP AND PAUL J. SZEPTYCKI\nAbstract. Assuming \u2666, we construct a T2 example of a hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f space of size \u03c91 which is not a D-space. The example\nhas the property that all finite powers are also Lindel\u00f6f.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe following notion is due to van Douwen, first studied with Pfeffer\nin [3].\nDefinition 1.1. A T1 space X is said to be a D-space if for each open\nneighbourhood assignment {Ux : x \u2208 X} there is a closed and discrete\nsubset D \u2286 X such that {Ux : x \u2208 D} covers the space.\nThe question whether every regular Lindel\u00f6f space is D has been attributed to van Douwen [8]. Moreover, van Douwen and Pfeffer pointed\nout that\n\"No satisfactory example of a space which is not a Dspace is known, where by satisfactory example we mean\nan example having a covering property at least as strong\nas metacompactness or subparacompactness.\"\nIndeed, the lack of satisfactory examples of D-spaces satisfying some\ninteresting covering properties continues and there has been quite a bit\nof activity in the area in the last decades (see the surveys [5] and [8]\nfor other related results and open problems). Whether regular Lindel\u00f6f\nspaces are D-spaces was listed as Problem 14 in Hru\u0161\u00e1k and Moore's\nlist of 20 open problems in set-theoretic topology [10], and there are\nno consistency results in either direction even for hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f\nspaces. The question whether Lindel\u00f6f implies D for the class of T1\nspaces was also open and explicitly asked in [6] and more recently in\n[1].\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 54D20, 54A35.\nKey words and phrases.

SZEPTYCKI\n\nIn this note, assuming \u2666, we construct an example of a hereditarily\nLindel\u00f6f T2 space that is not a D-space. The example also has the\nproperty that every finite power is Lindel\u00f6f, but we do not know if it\ncan be made regular.\nThe article is structured as follows; in Section 2 we gather a few general facts and definitions, and in Section 3 we present the construction.\nIn Section 4, we make some remarks and prove further properties of\nour construction. Finally, in Section 5 we state a few open problems.\n2. Preliminaries\nDelicate use of elementary submodels play crucial role in our arguments. We do not intend to give a precise introduction to this powerful\ntool since elementary submodels are widely used in topology nowadays;\nlet us refer to [4]. However, we present here a few easy facts and a\nlemma which could serve as a warm-up exercise for the readers less\ninvolved in the use of elementary submodels.\nLet H(\u03b8) denote the sets which have transitive closure of size less\nthan \u03b8 for some cardinal \u03b8. The following facts will be used regularly\nwithout explicitly referring to them.\nFact 2.1. Suppose that M \u227a H(\u03b8) for some cardinal \u03b8 and M is\ncountable.\n(a) If F \u2208 M and there is F \u2208 F \\ M then F is uncountable.\n(b) If B \u2208 M and B is countable then B \u2286 M.\nThe next lemma is well-known, nonetheless we present a proof.\nLemma 2.2. Let F \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 and suppose that M is a countable elementary submodel of H(\u03b8) for some cardinal \u03b8 such that F \u2208 M.\nIf there is an F \u2208 F such that F \u2208\n/ M then there is an uncountable\n\u2206-system G \u2286 F in M with kernel F \u2229 M.\nMoreover, if \u03c8(x, ...) is any formula with parameters from M and\n\u03c8(F, ...) holds then G can be chosen in such a way that \u03c8(G, ...) holds\nfor every G \u2208 G, as well.\nProof. Suppose that F , M, F \u2208 F \\ M and \u03c8 is as above. Let D = F \u2229\nM and let F0 = {G \u2208 F : D \u2286 G and \u03c8(G, ...)}. Clearly, F \u2208 F0 \u2208 M\nand F \u2208\n/ M thus F0 is uncountable. Moreover, F \u2229 \u03b1 = D for all \u03b1 in\na tail of M \u2229 \u03c91 ; that is, \u2203G \u2208 F0 : G \u2229 \u03b1 = D and this holds in M as\nwell, by elementary. Thus\nM |= \u2203\u03b2 < \u03c91 \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 (\u03b2, \u03c91)\u2203G \u2208 F0 : G \u2229 \u03b1 = D.\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE IN THE THEORY OF D-SPACES\n\n3\n\nThus this holds in H(\u03b8) as well, by elementary. Hence we can select\ninductively an uncountable \u2206-system from F0 . Using elementary again,\nthere is such a \u2206-system in M too.\n\u0003\nFor any set-theoretic notion, including background on \u2666, see [11].\nThere are different conventions in general topology whether to add\nregularity to the definition of a Lindel\u00f6f space. In this article, any\ntopological space X is said to be Lindel\u00f6f iff every open cover has a\ncountable subcover; that is, no separation is assumed.\nFinally, we need a few other definitions.\nDefinition 2.3. A collection U of subsets of a space X is called an\n\u03c9-cover if for every finite F \u2286 X there is U \u2208 U such that F \u2286 U.\nDefinition 2.4. A collection N of subsets of a space X is called a local\n\u03c0-network at the point x if for each open neighbourhood U of x in X,\nthere is an N \u2208 N such that N \u2286 U (it is not required that the sets in\nN be open, nor that they contain the point x).\n3. The Construction\nWe construct a topology by constructing a sequence {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 < \u03c91 }\nof subsets of \u03c91 such that \u03b3 \u2208 U\u03b3 for every \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c91 . The example will\nbe obtained by first taking the family {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 < \u03c91 } as a subbasis\nfor a topology on \u03c91 and then refining it with a Hausdorff topology of\ncountable weight.\nThe following lemma will be used to prove the Lindel\u00f6f property.\nLemma 3.1. Consider a topology on \u03c91 generated\nT by a family {U\u03b3 :\n\u03b3 < \u03c91 } as a subbase; sets of the form UF = {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 F } for\nF \u2208 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 form a base. If for every uncountable family B \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 of\npairwise disjoint sets there is a countable B \u2032 \u2286 B such that\n[\n|\u03c91 \\ {UF : F \u2208 B \u2032 }| \u2264 \u03c9\nthen the topology is hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f.\n\nProof. Fix an open family U; we may assume that U = {UF : F \u2208 G}\nfor some G \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 . Let M be a countably elementary submodel of\nH(\u03b8) for some sufficiently S\nlarge \u03b8 such that {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c91 }, G \u2208 M.\nIt suffices to prove that U is covered S\nby the\n\u0001 countable family V =\n{UF : F \u2208 G \u2229 M}. V\u0001 clearly covers\nU \u2229 M thus we consider\nS\nan arbitrary \u03b1 \u2208\nU \\ M. There is G0 \u2208 G such that \u03b1 \u2208 UG0 ;\nlet F = G0 \u2229 M. If F = G0 then V covers \u03b1 thus we are done.\n\n\f4\n\nD\u00c1NIEL T. SOUKUP AND PAUL J. SZEPTYCKI\n\nOtherwise there is an uncountable \u2206-system D \u2286 G in M with kernel\nF by Lemma 2.2. Consider the uncountable, pairwise disjoint family\nB = {G \\ F : G \u2208 D}; by our hypothesis there is a countable B \u2032 \u2286 B\nsuch that\n[\n|\u03c91 \\ {UH : H \u2208 B \u2032 }| \u2264 \u03c9.\n\nB \u2032 can be chosen in M since B \u2208 M; note that B \u2032 \u2286 M. Thus the\ncountable set of points not covered also lie in M. Therefore, there is\nG \\ F \u2208 B \u2032 such that \u03b1 \u2208 UG\\F . Hence \u03b1 \u2208 UG since \u03b1 \u2208 UG0 \u2286 UF\nand UG = UG\\F \u2229 UF . This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\u0003\n\nLet us define now the topology which will be used to ensure the\nHausdorff property.\nDefinition 3.2. Define a topology on [R]<\u03c9 as follows. Let Q \u2286 R be\na Euclidean open set and let Q\u2217 = {H \u2208 [R]<\u03c9 : H \u2286 Q}. Sets of the\nform Q\u2217 define a \u03c1 topology on [R]<\u03c9 .\nThe proof of the following claim is straightforward.\nClaim 3.3.\n(1) ([R]<\u03c9 , \u03c1) is of countable weight,\n(2) any family X \u2286 [R]<\u03c9 of pairwise disjoint nonempty sets forms\na Hausdorff subspace of ([R]<\u03c9 , \u03c1).\nLet us fix the countable base W = {Q\u2217 : Q is a disjoint union of\nfinitely many intervals with rational endpoints} for ([R]<\u03c9 , \u03c1).\nFor the remainder of this section we suppose \u2666; thus 2\u03c9 = \u03c91 and\nwe can fix an enumeration\n\u2022 {C\u03b1 }\u03b1<\u03c91 = [\u03c91 ]\u2264\u03c9 such that C\u03b1 \u2286 \u03b1 for all \u03b1 < \u03c91 .\nAlso, there is a \u2666-sequence {B\u03b3 }\u03b3<\u03c91 on [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 ; that is,\n\u2022 for every uncountable B \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 there are stationary many \u03b2 \u2208\n\u03c91 such that B \u2229 [\u03b2]<\u03c9 = B\u03b2 .\nThe next theorem is the key to our main result; we encourage the\nreader to first skip the quite technical proof of Theorem 3.4 and go\nto Corollary 3.8 to see how our main result is deduced. In particular,\nIH(3) assures the space is not a D-space and IH(4) makes the space\nhereditarily Lindel\u00f6f.\nTheorem 3.4. There exist {U\u03b3\u03b1 }\u03b3\u2264\u03b1 and \u03c6\u03b1 : (\u03b1 + 1) \u2192 [R]<\u03c9 for\n\u03b1 < \u03c91 with the following properties:\nIH(1) U\u03b3\u03b1 \u2286 \u03b1 + 1 and U\u03b1\u03b1 = \u03b1 + 1 for every \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 < \u03c91 , and the\nfamily \u03c6\u03b1 [\u03b1 + 1] is pairwise disjoint for every \u03b1 < \u03c91 .\nIH(2) U\u03b3\u03b1 = U\u03b3\u03b10 \u2229 (\u03b1 + 1) and \u03c6\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b10 \u21be (\u03b1 + 1) for all \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10 .\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE IN THE THEORY OF D-SPACES\n\n5\n\nLet \u03c4\u03b1 denote the topology generated by the sets\n{U\u03b3\u03b1 : \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1} \u222a {\u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 (W ) : W \u2208 W}\nT\nas a subbase.

A Hausdorff topology of countable weight \u03c4sc refined by a\nhereditarily Lindel\u00f6f topology \u03c4hl on some set X is again a hereditarily\nLindel\u00f6f, Hausdorff topology on X.\nProof. Let \u03c4ref denote the topology generated by \u03c4sc \u222a \u03c4hl as a subbase;\nthat is, \u03c4ref is the common refinement of \u03c4sc and \u03c4hl . \u03c4ref is clearly Hausdorff, we prove that for any open family U \u2286 \u03c4ref there is a countable\nU0 \u2286 U such that \u222aU0 = \u222aU. We can suppose that\nU = {Ui \u2229 Vji : i \u2208 \u03c9, j \u2208 Ii }\nwhere {Ui : i \u2208 \u03c9} \u2286 \u03c4sc and {Vji : i \u2208 \u03c9, j \u2208 Ii } \u2286 \u03c4hl for some index\nsets {Ii : i \u2208 \u03c9}. For every i \u2208 \u03c9 there is a countable Ji \u2286 Ii such that\n[\n[\nUi \u2229 {Vji : j \u2208 Ii } = Ui \u2229 {Vji : j \u2208 Ji }\nby the hereditarily Linel\u00f6fness of \u03c4hl . Thus\n[\n\u222aU = {Ui \u2229 Vji : i \u2208 \u03c9, j \u2208 Ji }\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE IN THE THEORY OF D-SPACES\n\nwhich completes the proof.\n\n11\n\n\u0003\n\nTherefore, it suffices to prove that the topology generated by {U\u03b3 :\n\u03b3 < \u03c91 } as a subbase on \u03c91 is hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f. Lemma\n3.1 and\nT\nthe proposition below gives us this result. Let UF = {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 F }\nfor F \u2208 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 .\n\nProposition 3.10. For any uncountable family of pairwise disjoint\nsets B \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 , there is a countable B \u2032 \u2286 B such that {UF : F \u2208 B \u2032 }\nis a cover, moreover an \u03c9-cover of a tail of \u03c91 .\n\nProof. Fix some uncountable family B \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 of pairwise disjoint\nsets. There is an M \u227a H(\u03b8) for some sufficiently large \u03b8 such that\nB, \u03c6, {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 < \u03c91 }, {B\u03b3 : \u03b3 < \u03c91 }, W \u2208 M and\nM \u2229 \u03c91 = \u03b2 and B \u2229 M = B \u2229 [\u03b2]<\u03c9 = B\u03b2 .\nS\nWe claim that {UF : F \u2208 B \u2032 } is an \u03c9-cover of \u03c91 \\ (\u03b2 + 1) for the\ncountable B \u2032 = B\u03b2 . Indeed, fix some finite K \u2286 \u03c91 \\ (\u03b2 + 1) and let\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c91 \\ (\u03b2 + 1) such that K \u2286 \u03b1. Then \u03b2 \u2208 T\u03b1 ensured by the model\nM, and hence there is some F \u2208 B\u03b2 = B \u2032 such that K \u2286 UF\u03b1 \u2286 UF by\nIH(4).\n\u0003\nNow we prove that (\u03c91 , \u03c4 ) is not a D-space. Consider the neighbourhood assignment \u03b3 7\u2192 U\u03b3 ; we show that \u222a{U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 C} =\n6 \u03c91 for every\nclosed discrete C \u2286 \u03c91 . Since (\u03c91 , \u03c4 ) is Lindel\u00f6f, |C| \u2264 \u03c9 and hence\nthere is \u03b1 < \u03c91 such that C\u03b1 = C. It suffices to note that C\u03b1 is \u03c4\u03b1\nclosed discrete if \u03c4 closed discrete; indeed, then \u222a{U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 C\u03b1 } =\n6 \u03b1+1\nby IH(3).\nFinally, (\u03c91 , \u03c4 ) has countable \u03a8-weight since \u03c4 is a refinement of a\nHausdorff topology which is of countable weight.\n\u0003\n4. Further properties\nIn [12] the authors asked the following:\nProblem 4.1 ([12, Problem 4.6]). Suppose that a space X has the\nproperty that for every open neighbourhood assignment\nS {Ux : x \u2208 X}\nthere is a second countable subspace Y of X such that {Ux : x \u2208 Y } =\nX ( dually second countable, in short). Is X a D-space?\nOur construction answers this question in the negative.\n\nProposition 4.2. The space X constructed in Corollary 3.8 is dually\nsecond countable, however not a D-space.\n\n\f12\n\nD\u00c1NIEL T. SOUKUP AND PAUL J. SZEPTYCKI\n\nProof. The space X has the property that every countable subspace is\nsecond countable; indeed, the subspace topology on \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c91 is generated\nby the sets U\u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 for \u03b2 < \u03b1 and {\u03c6\u22121 (W ) : W \u2208 W}, using the notations of the previous section. Therefore, by the Lindel\u00f6f property, for\nevery open neighbourhood assignment there is a countable and hence\nsecond countable subspace whose neighbourhoods cover the space. \u0003\nOur aim now is to prove that the space constructed in Corollary 3.8\nhas the property that all its finite powers are Lindel\u00f6f. Indeed, by a\ntheorem of Gerlits and Nagy [9], a space has all finite powers Lindel\u00f6f if\nand only if the space is an (\u03b5)-space, i.e., every \u03c9-cover has a countable\n\u03c9-subcover.\nLet us call our space from Corollary 3.8 X, and now establish the\nfollowing theorem:\nTheorem 4.3. Every subspace of X is an (\u03b5)-space.\nProof. First, let us prove the following analogue of Lemma 3.1.\nLemma 4.4. Consider a topology on \u03c91 generated by a family {U\u03b3 :\n\u03b3 < \u03c91 } as a subbase. If for every uncountable family B \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 of\npairwise disjoint sets there is a countable B \u2032 \u2286 B such that\n{UF : F \u2208 B \u2032 } is an \u03c9-cover of a tail of \u03c91\nthen the topology is a hereditarily (\u03b5)-space.\nProof. Fix Y \u2286 X and an \u03c9-cover U of Y ; we can \u0002suppose\n\u0003 that U =\n<\u03c9 <\u03c9\n{\u222a{UFi : i < m} : {Fi : i < m} \u2208 F} for some F \u2286 [\u03c91 ]\n. Let M\nbe a countably elementary submodel of H(\u03b8) for some sufficiently large\n\u03b8 such that {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c91 }, F \u2208 M. It suffices to prove the following.\nClaim 4.5. M \u2229 U is a countable \u03c9-cover of Y .\nProof. Let K \u2208 [Y ]<\u03c9 and let L = K \u2229 M. Clearly, M \u2229 U covers K\nif K = L \u2286 M; thus, we can suppose that K 6= L and hence K \u2208\n/ M.\nThere is some {Fi : i < m} \u2208 F such that K \u2286 \u222a{UFi : i < m}. Let\nDi = Fi \u2229 M for i < m and we can suppose that there is some n \u2264 m\nsuch that Fi 6= Di for i < n and Fi = Di for n \u2264 i < m. It follows from\nLemma 2.2 that there is an uncountable sequence {{Fi\u03b1 : i < m} : \u03b1 <\n\u03c91 } \u2286 F in M such that\n(1) {Fi\u03b1 : \u03b1 < \u03c91 } is an uncountable \u2206-system with kernel Di for\nevery i < n,\n(2) Fi\u03b1 = Fi for all \u03b1 < \u03c91 and n \u2264 i < m,\n(3) \u03b2 \u2208 UFi iff \u03b2 \u2208 UFi\u03b1 for every \u03b2 \u2208 L and \u03b1 < \u03c91 , i < m.\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE IN THE THEORY OF D-SPACES\n\n13\n\nThe uncountable family {Fi\u03b1 \\ DiS: \u03b1 < \u03c91 } is pairwise disjoint for\nevery i < n. Hence if we let F \u03b1 = i<n (Fi\u03b1 \\ Di ) for \u03b1 < \u03c91 then there\nis \u0398 \u2208 [\u03c91 ]\u03c91 \u2229 M such that B = {F \u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 \u0398} is pairwise disjoint as\nwell. By our hypothesis and elementary of M there is J \u2208 [\u0398]\u03c9 \u2229 M\nsuch that the countable B \u2032 = {UF \u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 J} is an \u03c9-cover of a tail of\n\u03c91 ; hence, an \u03c9-cover of \u03c91 \\ M since finite sets which are not covered\nalso lie T\nin M. So there is \u03b1 \u2208 J, and hence \u03b1 \u2208 M, such that K \\ M \u2286\nUF \u03b1 = i<n UFi\u03b1 \\Di . The open set U = \u222a{UFi\u03b1 : i < m} is in U \u2229 M.\nWe claim that K \u2286 U. Fix \u03b2 \u2208 K; there is some i < m such that\n\u03b2 \u2208 UFi . If \u03b2 \u2208 L then \u03b2 \u2208 UFi\u03b1 by (3). Suppose that \u03b2 \u2208 K \\ M; if\nn \u2264 i < m then Fi = Fi\u03b1 and we are done. If i < n then \u03b2 \u2208 UFi\u03b1 \\Di\nand \u03b2 \u2208 UFi \u2286 UDi so \u03b2 \u2208 UFi\u03b1 .\n\u0003\nWe are done with the proof of Lemma 4.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe claim that Proposition 3.10 and Lemma 4.4 implies that X is a\nhereditarily (\u03b5)-space. Indeed, our topology \u03c4 on \u03c91 is generated by\nthe sets\n{U\u03b4\u2032 : \u03b4 < \u03c91 } = {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 < \u03c91 } \u222a {\u03c6\u22121 (W ) : W \u2208 W}\nas a subbase. Suppose that B \u2286 [\u03c91 ]<\u03c9 is an uncountable family of\npairwise disjoint sets; since W is countable, there is B0 \u2208 [B]\u03c91 such\nthat U\u03b4\u2032 \u2208 {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c91 } for \u03b4 \u2208 \u222aB0 . Thus by Proposition 3.10, there\nis some countable B \u2032 \u2286 B0 such that {UF\u2032 : F \u2208 B \u2032 } is an \u03c9-cover of a\ntail of \u03c91 . Hence the assumption of Lemma 4.4 holds for X, thus X is\na hereditarily (\u03b5)-space.\n\u0003\nA well known weakening of \u2666 is Ostaszewski's \u2663, which is known\nto be consistent with \u03c91 < 2\u03c9 . We remark that \u2663 is not enough to\nconstruct a space of size \u03c91 which is Hausdorff and Lindel\u00f6f but not a\nD-space.\nClaim 4.6. It is consistent that \u2663 holds, 2\u03c9 is arbitrarily large, and\nevery T1 Lindel\u00f6f space of size less than 2\u03c9 is a D-space.\nProof. It is known that T1 Lindel\u00f6f spaces of size less than the dominating number d are Menger, and L. Aurichi proved that every Menger\nspace is a D-space [2]. Thus, it suffices to show that there is a model\nof ZFC where \u2663 holds, 2\u03c9 is arbitrarily large, and d = 2\u03c9 . I. Juh\u00e1sz\nproved in an unpublished note that it is consistent that \u2663 holds, 2\u03c9 is\narbitrarily large, and Martin's Axiom holds for countable posets; for a\nproof see [7]. It is easy to see that Martin's Axiom for countable posets\nimply d = 2\u03c9 .\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nD\u00c1NIEL T. SOUKUP AND PAUL J. SZEPTYCKI\n\n5. Questions\nLet us state some questions concerning Theorem 4.3. We do not\nknow whether the analogue of Claim 3.9 holds for hereditarily (\u03b5)spaces.\nQuestion 5.1. Suppose that \u03c4 and \u03c3 are second countable and hereditarily (\u03b5)-space topologies respectively on some set X. Is the topology\ngenerated by \u03c4 \u222a \u03c3 a hereditarily (\u03b5)-space again?\nWe do not know if being a hereditarily (\u03b5)-space implies the hereditarily Lindel\u00f6fness of finite powers.\nQuestion 5.2. Suppose that a space X is a hereditarily (\u03b5)-space. Is\nX n hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f for all n \u2208 \u03c9?\nThe following might be easier, nonetheless seems to be open.\nQuestion 5.3. Suppose that a space X has the property that A2 is\nLindel\u00f6f for all A \u2286 X. Is X 2 hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f ?\nWe mention two other versions of the question above.\nQuestion 5.4. (i) Suppose that a space X has the property that A \u00d7\nB is Lindel\u00f6f for all A, B \u2286 X. Is X 2 hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f ?\n(ii) Suppose that the spaces X, Y have the property that that A \u00d7 B\nis Lindel\u00f6f for all A \u2286 X and B \u2286 Y . Is X \u00d7 Y hereditarily\nLindel\u00f6f ?\nOf course, the main interest is in obtaining a regular counterexample\nto van Douwen's question. We conjecture that one should be able\nto modify our construction in such a way that the sets {U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208\n\u03c91 } \u222a {\u03c91 \\ U\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c91 } generate a 0-dimensional, T1 topology that is\nnot a D-space and has some additional interesting covering properties.\nE.g.,\nQuestion 5.5. Can we modify the construction to obtain a 0-dimensional\nT1 (hence regular) Lindel\u00f6f non D-space?\nFinally, let us finish with a more general question. We believe that\nour construction can be modified so that its finite powers are hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f, thus its \u03c9th power as well.\nQuestion 5.6. Suppose that a regular space X has the property that\nX \u03c9 is hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f. Is X a D-space?\n\n\fA COUNTEREXAMPLE IN THE THEORY OF D-SPACES\n\n15\n\nReferences\n[1] L.F.
