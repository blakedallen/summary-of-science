KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1 Introduction\nPG 1159 stars are hot hydrogen-deficient pre-WDs which\nare believed to be the outcome of a late or very late heliumshell flash during their post-AGB evolution. About 40 such\nobjects are known at present (Werner & Herwig, 2006), and\na subset of currently 11 objects forms the class of the pulsating GW Vir variables. From their evolutionary history, typical masses should be around 0.6 M\u2299 ; spectroscopic and asteroseismological mass determinations confirm this. These\nmethods however rely on stellar structure and evolution modelling, and can so far not be tested independently.\nNagel et al. (2006) have recently announced the unique\ndiscovery of a PG 1159 star in a close binary system, which\nmight for the first time allow a dynamical mass determination for a PG 1159 star. SDSS J212531.92-010745.9 was\ndiscovered to show H\u03b1 emission during a systematic search\nof SDSS archival data for white dwarf + main sequence\ncompanion candidates. It was subsequently classified as a\nPG 1159 star from a spectral analysis of the SDSS spectrum, and found to undergo brightness variations in followup time-resolved photometry. The light curve shows a periodicity of 6.95616(33) h, attributable to orbital motion, with\n\u22c6 Corresponding author: e-mail: schuh@astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de\n\na flat bottom part, and no eclipses. The periodic brightening\nwith a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.7 mag can be interpreted\nas the light contribution by the irradiated side of the cool\ncompanion.\nWe have continued the photometric coverage of this system during the following 2006 observing season, and report\nthe improved ephemeris with a more accurate period determination in this paper.\n\n2 Observations\nFollowing up the light curve of SDSS J212531.92-010745.9\npresented by Nagel et al. (2006), we have obtained new observations with the T\u00fcbingen 80 cm and the G\u00f6ttingen 50 cm\ntelescopes during 19 nights between September and November 2006. The full data set now available is listed in Table 1\nwith details of the set-up.\nData reduction was done using the TRIPP routines\n(Schuh et al., 2003). The images were bias, dark, and flat\nfield corrected, and relative light curves were obtained from\naperture photometry using the same set of reference stars for\nall data sets. The flux of the combined data was normalised\nto its mean value, and all times were heliocentrically corrected.\n\nc 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f790\n\nS.

The correct position of the dominant frequency can unambiguously be identified from the\nstrong alias pattern. The gain in accuracy over the 2005\ndata alone is illustrated by the central peak (grey line in the\nlower panel). By assuming the corresponding period as a\nstart value, the combined light curve was fitted with a nonlinear least-squares sine fit. It resulted in an improved period determination of 6.95573(5) h and a sinusoidal amplitude of 0.299(33) relative intensity change (0.284(28) mag).\nThe amplitude (and its uncertainty, determined as the 1 \u03c3\nresidual scatter of the original data after subtraction of the\nmean profile) should be considered as an estimate of the\nmagnitude of the brightness change only (for details see the\nDiscussion section).\n\nc 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\nReferring to the most recent observation to define the\nzero point, we determine the ephemeris of predicted maxima times to be\nHJD = 2454055.d2134(4) + 0.d 289822(2) * E.\nThe uncertainty in the period corresponds to the 1 \u03c3 formal\nfitting error, while the uncertainty in the zero point corresponds to half the cycle time in the short-exposure runs.\n\n4 Discussion\nIn Fig. 2, we compare the folded profile to the sinusoidal\namplitude of 0.299(33) relative intensity change. Clearly,\nthe observed peak-to-peak variation is not fully reproduced\nby the fit, owing to the broader trough and the narrow maximum already described by Nagel et al. (2006), who fitted\nmagnitude changes, while we now fit intensity changes. For\na higher fit amplitude and/or raised zero line, the observed\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n\fAstron.

Although the light curve solution presented\nby Nagel et al. (2006) still suffers from a degeneracy in mass\nand radius for the PG 1159 component, this light curve shape\nemphasizes the superiority of their more realistic model over\na plain sine fit and validates their interpretation of the observed brightening as a reflection effect.\nThe refined ephemeris and period determination will allow a precise extrapolation of the ephemeris well into the\nnext observing seasons, and facilitate the phasing of radial\nvelocity measurements. This additional information will help\nto lift the existing degeneracy, so that we will be able to\npresent a more elaborate light curve model in a future paper, and derive the masses in the system.\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\nTelescope\n80 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n80 cm\n50 cm\n\nCamera\nST-7E\nST-7E\nST-7E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nST-7E\nSTL-6303E\nST-7E\nST-7E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-1001E\nSTL-6303E\n\nAcknowledgements.
