Acknowledgments\n\n14\n\n1. Introduction\nGeneral Relativity is believed to be an accurate description of our classical world. While\nthis led to a revolution in physical thought in the twentieth century, it also introduced\na myriad of ambiguities and physical conundrums. One such ambiguity arises when\nattempting to understand the quantum description of black holes. Naive calculations\nseem to indicate that information may be lost and thereby destroy our notion of unitary\ntime evolution [1]. Physicists have battled over this issue for decades. As a proposed\nultimate theory of quantum gravity, string theory has intervened and provided some\nanswers. For a certain class of black hole geometries, a microscopic description exists\nin string theory which enables one to calculate macroscopic quantities such as entropy\nand Hawking radiation [2, 3]. Resulting arguments seem to indicate that there is no\nloss of information and the unitarity of physics is preserved [4\u20136].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fAnother class of solutions to General Relativity which have caused much debate are\ngeometries that are not black holes, but nevertheless have regions of infinite curvature,\nthat is, geometries with singularities un-shielded by horizons. Such geometries are\nubiquitous in General Relativity, but believed to be physically unsound. Again, string\ntheory has intervened and provided insight. There exist mechanisms in string theory\nwhich resolve naked singularities, resulting in consistent, non-singular physics [7\u20139].\nGeneral relativity also admits geometries that have closed timelike curves. Examples include the Godel universe [11], Kerr black holes [12, 13] and Gott's time machines [14]. Naively this would indicate that time travel is possible. This in turn gives\nbirth to a whole host of physical inconsistencies such as the Grandmother paradox,\nwhere one is allowed to modify the initial conditions that lead to ones own existence,\nand the Bootstrap paradox, where an effect is its own cause \u2217 .\nThere has been much work trying to address the paradoxes posed by these geometries. Some have accepted the possibility of time travel, while others have argued\nthat physical processes come into play rendering time travel impossible. In the case of\nGott's time machine, for instance, it has been shown that any attempt to create a time\nmachine in a closed universe would cause the space to collapse entirely [16\u201318]. Many\nbelieve that quantum physics will ultimately prevent all geometries which naively allow\ntime travel from forming. This led to a proposal by Stephen Hawking who stated \"It\nseems that there is a Chronology Protection Agency which prevents the appearance of\nclosed timelike curves and so makes the universe safe for historians.\" [19]\nAs of yet, the full consistency of geometries of this type has not been tested in\nstring theory \u2020 .\nIn this work, we will propose that a Chronology Protection Agency does indeed exist\nin string theory. Specifically, we will study solutions to ten dimensional supergravity\nwhich can be dimensionally reduced to give five dimensional rotating black holes. When\nthe rotation parameter exceeds a certain value, closed timelike curves appear outside\nof the horizon. By studying the full ten dimensional solution, we are able to track\ndown the source of causality violations. We will find that our solution breaks down\nlong before we reach the causally sick region. We conclude that the geometry must\nbe altered at this point. The causality violating region is never created and our usual\nnotion of chronology is retained.\nIn the next section, we will explore the geometry in detail, first presenting the\nfive dimensional black hole solution, then its ten dimensional counterpart. We will\nreview how closed timelike curves form in both the five dimensional and ten dimensional\ngeometries and how the causality bound is associated with a unitarity bound in the dual\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nSee, for example, [15] for a review\nSee [20] for a recent discussion on holography in supersymmetric Godel universes.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fconformal field theory. This bound, however, does not prohibit the causally undesirable\ngeometry from forming. In fact, supersymmetric solutions appear to exist for arbitrary\nvalues of angular momentum.\nIn order to determine if there is some form of an obstruction to creating the causality violating region which would have a non-unitary conformal field theory dual, in\nsection three, we examine the objects associated with the charges that make up the\ngeometry. We propose that there is indeed an obstruction to forming the geometry and\nthat chronology is protected. The agency of protection for the class of geometries that\nwe discuss is analogous to the enhancon mechanism presented in [9] which resolves a\nclass of naked singularities. In section four we study the conformal field theory dual\nin the context of the AdS/CFT duality. Unitarity requires that the naive solution be\ncorrected. We show that unitarity is indeed preserved once the geometry has been\ncorrected. We conclude in section five.\n\n2. The Geometry\n2.1 Five Dimensional Black Hole\nLet us begin by presenting the five dimensional rotating black hole solution. We will\nconsider a black hole with three charges, call them Q1 , Q5 , and Qk . The metric for this\ngeometry is\ni2\nJ\n2\n2\nds = \u2212(f1 f5 fk )\ndt + 2 (sin \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2212 cos \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n2r\nh\ni\n1\n+(f1 f5 fk ) 3 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b82 + r 2 (sin2 \u03b8d\u03c621 + cos2 \u03b8d\u03c622 )\n\u2212 23\n\n2\n\nh\n\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere, as usual, the fi are harmonic functions associated with the charges, fi = 1 +\nQi /r 2 . In addition to the metric, this supergravity solution has the following moduli\nand gauge fields under which the black hole is charged,\n1/4\n\nfk\nf\nf5\ne2\u03c3 = 1/4\ne\u03c3i = 11/4\nf1\nf5 f 3/4\nf5\nh\ni\n1\nQ1\nJ\n2\n2\nA=\n\u2212 2 dt + 2 (sin \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2212 cos \u03b8d\u03c62 )\nf1\nr\n2r\nh\ni\nQk\nJ\n1\n\u2212 2 dt + 2 (sin2 \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\nAk =\nfk\nr\n2r\n1 J\nB = Q5 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 +\ndt \u2227 (sin2 \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n2\nf1 2r\ne\u22122\u03c6 =\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\n\fwith i = 1, ...4.\nThis geometry has been studied extensively by many authors [22\u201326]. In order to\nhave a supersymmetric rotating black hole, the horizon must be stationary. In [24] it\nwas shown that the horizon is not rotating. The nonzero rotation parameter affects the\nhorizon by turning it into a squashed sphere. Since the squashing parameter depends\non the angular momentum, J, one can show that a sensible description of the horizon\ncan breakdown if J becomes too large.\nIt was additionally shown that this geometry has closed timelike curves. Luckily, if\nJ is small enough, all closed timelike curves are hidden behind the horizon. However,\nwhen J becomes too large, closed timelike curves appear outside of the horizon leading\nto gross causality violations. The full sickness of this over-rotating black hole geometry\nwas studied in detail in [25].\nThe causality constraint on J can be seen explicitly by looking at the angular\ncomponents of the metric. The chronology horizon, Rch , is the location where g\u03c6i \u03c6i\nvanishes. Closed timelike curves appear when g\u03c6i \u03c6i becomes negative. This occurs\nif J 2 > 4 (r 2 + Q1 )(r 2 + Q5 )(r 2 + Qk ). Since the horizon is located at the origin in\nthese coordinates, an observer outside of the horizon will see closed timelike curves if\nJ 2 > 4 Q1 Q5 Qk .\nThis constraint on J also becomes apparent when studying the thermodynamics of\nthe black hole. Its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is\n\u03c02\nS=\n2G5\n\nr\n\nQ1 Q5 Qk \u2212\n\nJ2\n4\n\n(2.6)\n\nThis can become imaginary if J is too large. To be complete, let us also specify the\nmass of the black hole\nM=\n\n\u03c0\n(Q1 + Q5 + Qk )\n4G5\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe can attempt to understand the origin of the causally sick region by lifting this\nfive dimensional solution to ten dimensions and studying the fundamental objects which\ncreate the black hole. We will begin this process by presenting the ten dimensional\ngeometry below.\n2.2 Ten Dimensional D\u2013Brane Geometry\nUpon lifting to ten dimensions, we find a supergravity description of D1 and D5\u2013\nbranes with momentum running along the effective D\u2013string [26]. The D5\u2013branes are\nadditionally wrapped on T4 . The metric, RR field and the dilaton are\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fi\n1 h\nQk\nJ\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u221a\nds =\n\u2212 dt + 2 (dz \u2212 dt) + dz + 2 (sin \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2212 cos \u03b8d\u03c62 )(dz \u2212 dt)\nr\nr\nf1 f5\ns\nh\ni\np\nf1 2\ndsT 4 + f1 f5 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b82 + r 2 (sin2 \u03b8d\u03c621 + cos2 \u03b8d\u03c622 )\n(2.8)\n+\nf5\n2\n\n1 J\n1\ndt \u2227 dz +\n(sin2 \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) \u2227 (dz \u2212 dt) + Q5 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03c62 (2.9)\n2\nf1\nf1 2r\nf5\ne\u22122\u03a6 =\n(2.10)\nf1\nThe charges Q1 , Q5 , Qk and J are given by\nC (2) =\n\ng 2\u03b1\u20324\ng 2\u03b1\u20324\ng\u03b1\u20323\n\u2032\nN1 ,\nQ5 = g\u03b1 N5 ,\nQk = 2 Nk ,\nJ=\nFR\n(2.11)\nQ1 =\nV\nRV\nRV\nwhere we have N1 D1\u2013branes, N5 D5\u2013branes, Nk units of right moving momentum,\nand the angular momentum is quantized in terms of integers FR . V is the volume of\nT 4 and R is the radius of the S 1 .\nThis is a IIB supergravity solution with four supercharges. We can consider curves\nwhich have tangent vectors given by\nl\u03bc \u2202\u03bc = \u03b1 \u2202z + \u03b2 (\u2202\u03c61 \u2212 \u2202\u03c62 )\n\n(2.12)\n\n[26]. Since z is a compact direction, for certain values of \u03b1 and \u03b2, curves of this type\ncan be closed. Also, a quick calculation of the proper length shows that these curves can\nbe timelike in the region r < Rch . Closed timelike curves reappear in ten dimensional\nlanguage. We have not been able to successfully rid ourselves of the sickness associated\nwith the five dimensional geometry\nIn fact, we can do better than this. We can T-dualize our solution to find a system\nwhich should have the same physics. In the new geometry, the full sickness of this\nconfiguration becomes apparent. Performing a T-duality along the z direction, we find\na solution to IIA supergravity with the following metric.\ns\nh\ni\nJ\nf1 2\n1\n\u2212 dt2 + 2 (\u2212 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c61 + cos2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) dt +\nds2 = \u221a\nds 4\n2r\nf5 T\nfk f1 f5\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\np\nJ 2 cos2 \u03b8\nJ 2 sin2 \u03b8\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr sin \u03b8 d\u03c61 + 1 \u2212\nr cos \u03b8 d\u03c62\n+ f1 f5 1 \u2212\n4 r 6 f1 f5 fk\n4 r 6 f1 f5 fk\nh dz 2\ni\np\nJ2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u221a\n+\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 d\u03c61 d\u03c62 + f1 f5\n(2.13)\n+ dr + r d\u03b8\n2 r 4 fk f1 f5\nfk\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fSince g\u03c6i \u03c6i can become negative, we see clearly that for large enough J causality violations are an integral part of ten-dimensional physics. The causally sick region in\nthe higher dimensional geometry coincides precisely with the causally sick region of the\nlower dimensional black hole.\n2.3 The Dual Field Theory\nThe geometry is not the only place where we find a breakdown in our physical description of this solution. Recall that there is a gauge theory that describes this configuration [2, 22]. If we take the size of the S 1 to be much larger than the size of the T 4 , the\neffective description is the 1+1 dimensional field theory living on the world volume of\nthe D1\u2013branes. In the decoupling limit, we have the near horizon limit of our D\u2013brane\ngeometry, AdS3 \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 T 4 , which is dual to an N = 4 conformal field theory living on\nthe boundary of the AdS3 .\nTurning off angular momentum for a moment, the supersymmetric states of the\nfield theory that we are interested in are in the left moving ground state with arbitrary\nright moving charge. Since these states are BPS, the energy and momentum are related\nby E \u223c Nk /R, where R is the radius of the S 1 .\nAdding rotation requires that we use up some of the energy of the oscillator modes.\nWe can break up the N = 4 superconformal algebra into left and right moving N = 2\nalgebras. There is a U(1) subgroup associated with each and we can specify the charges\nas (FR , FL ).\nOne can bosonise the U(1) currents [22] to show that a state with charge FR is\nrepresented by an operator of the form\n!\n\u221a\ni 3FR \u03c6\n\u221a\nO = exp\n\u03a6\n(2.14)\nc\nwhere \u03a6 is an operator from the rest of the field theory. The eigenvalue of L0 gives the\nconformal weight of primary operators. Since L0 (O) = Nk ,\nL0 (\u03a6) = Nk \u2212\n\nFR2\n4N1 N5\n\n(2.15)\n\nUnitarity requires that conformal weights be positive. We see then that Nk \u2265 FR2 /(4N1 N5 ),\nor equivalently, Qk \u2265 J 2 /(4Q1 Q5 ). This is nothing more than the causality bound that\nwe saw previously. So we see that the unitarity bound of the conformal field theory\ncoincides with the causality bound of the geometry [26]. Let us also note that (2.15)\nrepresents the effective level of the system after we have used some energy to add angular momentum. The level determines the degeneracy of states. The entropy can\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fbe easily calculated and agrees with the Bekenstein- Hawking entropy (2.6) calculated\nabove [22].\nWe have seen that the physics of this solution breaks down in three dual descriptions: the five dimensional black hole, the ten dimensional D\u2013brane configuration and\nthe two dimensional conformal field theory. In an attempt to understand how we might\nresolve the causally sick region, we will study the ten dimensional supergravity solution\na bit further below.\n\n3. The Resolution\n3.1 The Geometry\nWe can imagine building our geometry by slowly bringing in D\u2013brane charge from\ninfinity. A probe calculation will determine if this is a consistent thing to do. The\naction for a D1\u2013brane is\nZ\nZ\np\n2\n\u2212\u03a6\nS = \u2212\u03c41 d \u03c3 e\n\u2212det g + \u03c41 C (2)\n(3.1)\n\nWorking in static gauge t = \u03c4, z = \u03c3, and choosing the ansatz xi = xi (\u03c4 ), y a = y a ,\nwhere the xi run over the transverse directions and the y a run over the T 4 , the slow\nvelocity limit of the action is\nZ\nh\ni\nS = \u03c41 d2 \u03c3 f1 f5 fk \u1e59 2 + r 2 (\u03b8\u03072 + sin2 \u03b8\u03c6\u030721 + cos2 \u03b8\u03c6\u030722 )\n(3.2)\n\nIn this limit, the potential vanishes leaving behind a purely kinetic term in the action.\nWe can therefore consistently bring D1\u2013branes to the origin. A similar analysis holds\nfor D5\u2013branes (after dualizing the RR 2-form to get the appropriate RR 6-form under\nwhich the D5\u2013branes are electrically charged). So there is no obstacle here. Where,\nthen, is the problem?\nWe have probed this geometry with objects associated with two of the charges that\nmake up the geometry. Recall that there is also charge associated with momentum\nmodes running along the effective D\u2013string, Qk . This is nothing more than a gravitational wave. In a T-dual picture, this charge is associated with a fundamental string.\nThere is additional momentum, J, associated with rotation. In order to determine\nwhere the breakdown in our geometry may be occurring, let us consider its microscopic\ndescription.\nWe can think of a bound state of one D1\u2013brane and N5 D5\u2013branes as a system\nof N5 fractional strings [27\u201329]. If we have N1 D1\u2013branes, there are a total of N1 N5\nfractional strings. In this model, angular momentum can be added to the system\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fby allowing each sub-string to be in a particular spin state of the SUR (2) \u00d7 SUL (2)\nsymmetry [29]. We can join together any number of the sub-strings. The spin of the\nstring created, however, must be the same as that of a single string. The maximum\nangular momentum of the system, then, occurs when all of the strings are split and\naligned along the same direction. The angular momentum of this state is ( N12N5 , N12N5 ).\nThere are also massless open strings in our system which begin and end on the\nD\u2013branes. When we add Nk units of momentum along these massless strings, the\nentropically favored configuration is one in which all of the fractional strings join and\nform a single long string with an effective length of order R\u2032 = N1 N5 R, where R is\nthe radius of the S 1 along which the D-branes are wrapped [28]. The effective level\nof the string state becomes N \u2032 = N1 N5 Nk . If we want to add angular momentum to\nthis system, it must be carried by the massless strings since the spin of the single long\nstring formed by the D\u2013branes is effectively zero [29]. The effective level, once we add\nangular momentum, becomes\n\u0012\nN = N1 N5 Nk \u2212\n\u2032\n\nFR2\n4N1 N5\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe standard thermodynamic quantities can easily be calculated in this model. Since\nopen strings are attached to the horizon in this limit, they account for the degrees\n\u221a of\nfreedom which give rise to the entropy of the black hole. The entropy is S = 2\u03c0 N \u2032 .\nThis agrees with (2.6).\nReturning to the supergravity picture, we want to form the three charge black\nhole. We therefore assume that the D\u2013branes have fractionalized and joined together\nto form one long string. We have seen from the above probe calculation (3.2) that\nwe can consistently bring D1 and D5\u2013branes in from infinity to the origin to form our\ngeometry. What about the momentum modes with non-zero rotation which, in the\nsupergravity description, correspond to rotating gravitational waves?\nWe will attempt to add rotating gravitational waves to a D1-D5 system by doing\nthe following. Assume we have an interior geometry made up of only D1 and D5\u2013brane\ncharge. The metric for this system is:\n\ni\n1 h\nds2 = \u221a\n\u2212dt\u20322 +dz \u20322 +\nf1 f5\n\ns\n\nh\ni\nf1 2 p\n2\n\u20322\ndsT 4 + f1 f5 dr 2 +r 2 d\u03b82 +r 2 (sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6\u20322\n+cos\n\u03b8d\u03c6\n)\n1\n2\nf5\n(3.4)\nWe will join this to the geometry (2.8) which additionally has rotating gravitational\nwaves. We will join these two geometries together at some radius R. Continuity of the\nmetric requires the coordinates to be related by the following transformations:\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f\u03c6\u20321 = \u03c61 +\n\u03c6\u20322 = \u03c62 \u2212\n\nJ\n\n(z \u2212 t)\n\n2R4 F1 F5\nJ\n\n(z \u2212 t)\n\n2R4 F1 F5\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ2\n1\n(z \u2212 t)\nQk \u2212\nz =z+\n2R2\n4R4 F1 F5\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ2\n1\n\u2032\n(z \u2212 t)\nQk \u2212\nt = t+\n2R2\n4R4 F1 F5\n\u2032\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere Fi = (1 + Qi /R2 ).\nOur new geometry has D1 and D5\u2013branes at the origin and rotating gravitational\nwaves localized on the shell at radius R. The standard Israel matching conditions\n[30] give the tension and pressures associated with the joining shell. With this, we\ncan determine if it is consistent to bring the gravitational waves in to the origin and\nhence create the geometry which is described by equation (2.8) for all r. The energy\u221a\nmomentum tensor for the shell is S\u03bd\u03bc = 8\u03c0G10 Grr T\u03bd\u03bc with\nT00\n\n=\n\n\u2212Tzz\n\n=\n\nT0z\n\n=\n\n\u2212Tz0\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ2\n2\n= 3 Qk \u2212\nR\n4R4 F1 F5\n\nT0\u03c61 = \u2212T0\u03c62 = Tz\u03c62 = \u2212Tz\u03c61 =\nT\u03c601 = T\u03c6z1 = \u2212\nT\u03c602 = T\u03c6z2 =\n\nJ\nR5 F12 F52\n\n(3.6)\n\ng(R)\n\nJ\ng(R) sin2 \u03b8\n3\nR F1 F5\nJ\n\nR3 F1 F5\n\ng(R) cos2 \u03b8\n\nT\u03b1,\u03b2 = 0\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 runs over the transverse directions and the T 4 , G10 = 8\u03c0\u03b1\u20324 g 2 is the ten\ndimensional Newton's constant and g(R) = [2 + (R2 F1 F5 )\u2032 /(RF1 F5 )]. The energymomentum tensor is all we need determine where the breakdown of our geometry\noccurs. But let us stop here for a moment to confirm that it is indeed what we expect.\nFirst, notice that the stresses and energy vanish in the transverse direction. This\ntells us that there are no transverse forces acting on the shell to prohibit it from forming\nand it is consistent to bring it in from infinity. Next, for large R, the asymptotic tension\nof the shell, T00 , goes like the inverse of the area of a three sphere. This gives precisely\nthe charge-energy relationship that we expect for a gravitational wave, E \u223c Qk , and\nit contributes the appropriate amount to the asymptotic mass of the black hole (2.7).\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fFinally, the non-vanishing off-diagonal angular components of the stress energy tensor\nencode the rotation of the shell.\nThe tension of the shell,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\nJ2\n\u03c4 = 3 Qk \u2212\n(3.7)\nR\n4R4 F1 F5\nrepresents the local energy density of the incoming gravitational waves from the supergravity perspective and massless strings from the microscopic D\u2013brane point of view.\nPlacing the shell at a radius R, the effective local Kaluza Klein momentum E \u223c P \u2032 is\nP \u2032 \u223c Qk \u2212\n\nJ2\n4R4 F1 F5\n\n(3.8)\n\nRecall that momentum corresponds to the mass of Kaluza Klein particles in a compactified theory. Hence, we have Kaluza Klein particles with m \u223c P \u2032 .\nIf J > 4 Q1 Q5 Qk , the tension and momentum of the shell vanishes before the\nchronology horizon is reached. This occurs at a radius\ns\nJ2\n(Q1 + Q5 ) 1\n2\n+\n.\n(3.9)\n(Q1 \u2212 Q5 )2 +\nRcp\n=\u2212\n2\n2\nQk\nIf we place the shell at this radius, the energy density of our constructed geometry is\nsmooth and the mass of the Kaluza Klein particles vanishes. New massless states arise\nin the compactified theory which imply that the low energy theory must be corrected.\nIf we try to bring the shell of gravitational waves in past Rcp , the energy density of\nthe shell becomes negative. In order to avoid negative energy densities, we conclude\nthat the gravitational waves are unable to travel past Rcp . This occurs precisely at the\npoint in moduli space where we expect corrections to the supergravity theory due to\nthe presence of the massless Kaluza Klein particles. Since the causally sick region is\nnever created, chronology is protected.\nLet us stop for a moment to recap. The naive supergravity solution is made up of\nD1\u2013branes, D5\u2013branes, and massless strings carrying momentum which are represented\nby gravitational waves. Following [28, 29], we have argued that the rotation in our\ngeometry is carried by the gravitational waves. We were able to bring D1 and D5\u2013\nbranes in to the origin. When we tried to bring in rotating gravitational waves from\ninfinity to complete the construction of our geometry, we found that negative energy\ndensities appear before the chronology horizon is reached. In order to avoid negative\nenergy densities, we propose that the gravitational waves are not able to travel beyond\na chronology protection radius, Rcp . This radius is the location in moduli space where\nKaluza Klein particles become massless. It is also the location where the energy of the\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fshell due to momentum along the compact direction exactly cancels the energy due to\nrotation. The ten dimensional geometry, therefore, has a smooth energy density. The\nfinal corrected geometry has momentum charge localized on the shell at radius Rcp\noutside of the would-be chronology horizon with D1 and D5\u2013branes at the origin. The\npotential causality violating region is never able to form and chronology is protected.\nWe should note that although we wrapped the D5\u2013branes on T 4 , we could have\nwrapped them on K3. Depending on the values of the parameters, wrapping branes\non K3 can have the undesirable effect of creating naked singularities of repulson type.\nLuckily, these singularities can easily be resolved as shown in [31, 32]. The extension\nof our result to this case is straight forward. Since the origin of the causality violating\nregion are the rotating gravitational waves and not the D1 or D5\u2013branes, the resulting\ngeometry will have a shell of D1 and D5\u2013branes placed at the appropriate radius to\nresolve the repulson singularity and a shell of rotating gravitational waves placed at the\nchronology protection radius Rcp , as discussed here, to prevent closed timelike curves\nfrom forming.\n3.2 Repulsive Coulomb Force\nLet us return to the five dimensional geometry (2.2) - (2.5). The ten dimensional\nrotating gravitational wave becomes a particle charged under the gauge field Ak in five\ndimensions. We can probe our geometry with a point particle with charge q which\ncouples to the gauge field Ak . The Hamiltonian for such a particle is [26].\nH = g \u03bc\u03bd (p\u03bc + qAk\u03bc )(p\u03bd + qAk\u03bd )\n\n(3.10)\n\nLet us focus on the Coulomb potential that the particle feels moving radially in\nthis background.\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\nqQk\nJ2\n\u03bc\u03bd\nk\nk\nV = q g (p\u03bc A\u03bd + p\u03bd A\u03bc ) = 2 1 \u2212\nf1 f5\n(3.11)\nr\n4Qk r 4 f1 f5\n\nThe Coulomb interaction changes sign precisely at r = Rcp , if the Coulomb force was\nattractive for r > Rcp , it becomes negative for r < Rcp and visa versa [26]. So it\nappears as though there is some non-trivial charged object localized at the surface\nr = Rcp . Our resolved geometry simply places it there. Again, this is analogous to\nthe mechanism of [9,21] where a point particle probe interacting with the gravitational\nfield felt nontrivial mass localized on a surface. The resolved geometry in that case\nsimply placed the appropriate massive objects (D6-D2*\u2013branes) at that location.\nIn fact, as we saw previously, the asymptotic tension of the shell goes like Qk /A3 .\nThis is precisely the relationship that we expect for a particle charged under the gauge\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\ffield Ak with its charge smeared over a three sphere. Recall also that the shell is located\nat a safe distance away from the causally sick region, Rcp > Rch . So the end result\nis that a rotating shell with asymptotic charge Qk and local charge density given by\n(3.7) forms outside of the chronology horizon and thereby prevents any attempt to\ncreate closed timelike curves. The interior region is no longer sick. It is just a standard\ncompactified D1\u2013D5\u2013brane geometry.\nUp to this point, we have only used the microscopic description of our solution\nto determine which objects carry the charges. A similar analysis was carried out for\ngeometries with naked singularities of repulson type in [21]. There is a general rule here.\nThe limits of physical consistency are exceeded before the sick regions can be created.\nFor a large class of geometries which are physically unsound, a simple geometric study\nof the laws of physics alone can reveal how one might correct a geometry to render it\nphysically sound.\n3.3 Massless Strings\nReturning now to the microscopic description of our configuration, recall that the naive\ngeometry is a solution to Type IIB effective low energy supergravity with momentum\nmodes and no winding modes. In a T-dual picture, momentum modes and winding\nmodes are interchanged. A T-dual string, then, has winding number and hence mass\nproportional to (3.8). If we try to construct the T-dual geometry, as we bring the strings\nin from infinity to create the geometry, the mass of the strings vanish at the chronology\nprotection radius, Rcp . When massive modes become light, their contribution to the\nlow energy effective theory can no longer be ignored. The low energy theory must be\ncorrected at this point to include the new massless degrees of freedom.\nHappily, massless modes appear at the chronology protection radius, Rcp . The\nbreakdown in the supergravity theory coincides precisely with the breakdown we encountered when trying to construct the geometry above, since we encountered negative\nenergy densities beyond Rcp . Once the new massless degrees of freedom have been taken\ninto account, we propose that the above geometry is, to leading order, the solution to\nthe corrected supergravity theory.\n\n4. Unitarity in the Conformal Field Theory\nWe have proposed that the naive BMPV black hole and D1-D5-Wave geometries cannot\nbe constructed when the angular momentum parameter exceeds a certain bound, J 2 >\n4Q1 Q5 Qk . Instead, a shell carrying Qk and J charge forms outside of the would be\ncausally sick region. The charges needed to create the causality violating region are\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fnot permitted to travel past this shell. Closed timelike curves, therefore, are not able\nto form and the resulting geometry is causally safe.\nWe can take the decoupling limit of the repaired geometry to study the AdS space\nwhich is dual to a conformal field theory. As we saw previously, the causality bound of\nour spacetime coincides with a unitarity bound in the conformal field theory [26]. We\ncan take the limit of our resolved geometry to see if it agrees with the expected result.\nAssuming that the angular momentum exceeds the unitarity bound, the shell of\ngravitational waves forms outside of the horizon at the chronology protection radius,\nRcp . Zooming in on the near horizon region gives the near horizon geometry of the\nD1\u2013D5\u2013brane configuration of (3.4). This is nothing more than the zero mass BTZ\nblack hole. The unitarity violations discussed in section 2.3 have been remedied. The\ndual conformal field theory of the corrected geometry is unitary.\n\n5. Conclusion\nAs a fundamental theory of quantum gravity, string theory has been shown to successfully resolve many of the paradoxes inherent in Einstein's theory of General Relativity.\nExamples include non-singular descriptions of geometries with regions of infinite curvature and evidence that information is not lost in black hole geometries. We propose\nthat string theory also has something to say about closed timelike curves.\nWe studied the BMPV rotating black hole and its higher dimensional Wave-D1D5\u2013brane analogue. Naively, closed timelike curves appear outside of the horizon if the\nrotation parameter exceeds a certain value. When trying to construct the geometry,\nhowever, we saw that massless degrees of freedom arise before reaching the causally sick\nregion. These new degrees of freedom appear at precisely the location where the energy\ndue to transverse momentum cancels the energy due to rotation of the gravitational\nwaves which make up our geometry. We propose that the special radius where this\noccurs is a chronology protection horizon, beyond which the gravitational waves cannot\ntravel. Instead they expand to form a shell outside of the chronology violating region.\nSince the presence of the gravitational waves beyond this point was crucial to create\nthe causally sick region, our geometry is rendered safe and chronology is protected.\nIf J exceeds the causality bound in the naive solution, the dual conformal field\ntheory would be non-unitary. The correction to the geometry that has been proposed\nis not only causally safe, but has a unitarity conformal field theory dual.\nThe agent of chronology protection for the class of geometries studied here has a\nnatural physical interpretation. Assume we begin with the standard low energy solution\n(2.8) with J < 4 Q1 Q5 Qk . If we increase the angular momentum so that this bound\nis no longer satisfied, the gravitons in the ten dimensional language and the Kaluza\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fKlein particles in the lower dimensional language begin to expand. This expansion is\ndue to the centrifugal repulsion and causes the gravitons (particles) to grow to just the\nright size to compensate for the repulsive force acting on them. The end result is that\ngiant gravitons (particles) form well outside of the chronology horizon to prevent the\ncausally sick region from being created\nIt is important to note that the configurations studied in this paper are a part of a\nlarger class of geometries related by a series of dualities. For instance, the dyonic black\nhole and NS5\u2013NS1\u2013wave configurations considered in [36] are S-dual to the backgrounds\nstudied here. The chronology protection arguments should have a dual description in\nthese geometries.\nTime travel gives rise to a host of physical inconsistencies. One may conclude that\nany fundamental theory of quantum gravity would not admit solutions where time\ntravel is possible. The low energy effective equations of string theory have as solutions\nan abundance of such causality violating geometries [20, 37\u201339]. We believe, however,\nthat string theory is causally sound. As we have argued for the class of geometries\nstudied here, stringy corrections to the low energy effective theory resolve causality\nviolations. We propose that once all stringy effects are taken into account, our usual\nnotion of chronology will emerge as a protected law of nature.\n\n6. Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank B.
