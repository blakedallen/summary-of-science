We define a motivic analogue of the Haar measure for groups\nof the form G(k((t))), where k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and G is a reductive algebraic group defined over k. A\nclassical Haar measure on such groups does not exist since they are not\nlocally compact. We use the theory of motivic integration introduced\nby M.

This function takes values in\nthe so-called dimensional completion of the Grothendieck ring of the category of varieties over the base field. It is invariant under translations\nby all elements of G(k((t))), and therefore we call it a motivic analogue\nof Haar measure. We give an explicit construction of the motivic Haar\nmeasure, and then prove that the result is independent of all the choices\nthat are made in the process, even though we have no general uniqueness\nstatement.\n\n0. Introduction\nIn this paper we define a version of Haar measure on groups that arise\nwhen taking the set of points of an algebraic group over a \"large\" local\nfield. For an algebraic group G defined over an algebraically closed field k\nof characteristic zero, we consider the set of its points G(F ) over the field\nF = k((t)) of Laurent series with coefficients in k. Since F is a local field,\nit can be expected that G(F ) would be in many ways analogous to a padic group. However, there is no hope for a Haar measure on G(F ) in the\nusual sense, since, unlike the p-adic situation, the set G(F ) is not locally\ncompact. Our objective is to define a \"variety-valued\" invariant measure\non G(F ) in the case when G is reductive, and give an explicit formula for\nsuch a measure. We are able to do this by means of the theory of motivic\nintegration introduced by M. Kontsevich, [13].\nIn the original theory of motivic integration, the motivic measures live\non arc spaces of (smooth) varieties and take values in a certain completion\nof the Grothendieck ring of the category of all algebraic varieties over k.\nThe arc spaces are defined as follows. For an algebraic variety X over k,\nthe space of formal arcs on X is denoted by L(X). It is the inverse limit\nlim Ln (X) in the category of k-schemes of the schemes Ln (X) representing\n\u2190\u2212\nthe functors defined on the category of k-algebras by\nR 7\u2192 Mork\u2212schemes(Spec R[t]/tn+1 R[t], X).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nThe set of k-rational points of L(X) can be identified with the set of\npoints of X over k[[t]], that is,\nMork\u2212schemes(Spec k[[t]], X).\nThere are canonical morphisms \u03c0n : L(X) \u2192 Ln (X) \u2013 on the set of points,\nthey correspond to truncation of arcs. In particular, when n = 0, we get\nthe the natural projection \u03c0X : L(X) \u2192 X. The canonical motivic measure\nis an additive function (whose values are, roughly speaking, equivalence\nclasses of k-varieties) on a certain algebra of subsets of the space L(X)\n(see [6]). In the case when X is a smooth variety over k, this function\n\u22121\n(\u03c0X (A)) with A a subvariety of X the\nassigns to the sets of the form \u03c0X\nequivalence class of A. Loosely speaking, the canonical motivic measure\n\"projects under \u03c0X to the tautological measure on X\" (see sections 1.2,\n1.3). Such a normalization makes the motivic measure on L(X) unique, [6]\n(hence the term \"canonical\").\nFor an algebraic group G, uniqueness implies that the canonical motivic\nmeasure on L(G) is automatically invariant under translations by the elements of L(G). We observe that by definition of an arc space, the set of\nk-points of L(G) is in bijection with the set of k[[t]]-points of G, that is,\nwith the set of integral points in G(F ) (In the p-adic analogy, L(G) corresponds to a maximal compact subgroup inside a p-adic group). Our task is\nto extend the motivic measure beyond the integral points of G(F ) in such\na way that it would be invariant under the translations by all elements of\nG(F ).\nFor our construction, the arc spaces will not quite suffice because G(F )\nis not in bijection with the set of k-points of any arc space. We will need a\nslightly more general setup, described in the Bourbaki talk by E. Looijenga\n[15], and also the language of ind-schemes, needed to handle objets that\nare \"bigger\" than arc spaces. We review all the necessary definitions and\ntheorems in the next section. In Section 2, we first extend the motivic\nmeasure on L(An ) to the ind-scheme over k whose set of k-points coincides\nwith the F -points of An . We then transport the motivic measure from the\naffine space to a full measure subset of G(F ) (namely, the big cell), using\nthe translation-invariant differential form on G.\nAcknowledgement. I am deeply grateful to my advisor T. C. Hales\nfor suggesting this project and guiding me through it, and to F. Loeser,\nA.-M. Aubert, A. Bravo, Ju-Lee Kim, J. Korman, A. Kuronya, E. Lawes,\nN. Ramachandran, M. Roth and V. Vologodsky for helpful conversations\nand suggestions.\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1. The space of sections. Almost everything in the following three subsections is quoted from [15].\nWe reserve the symbol D for Spec k[[t]]. The term D-variety will mean a\nseparated reduced scheme that is flat and of finite type over D and whose\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n3\n\nclosed fiber is reduced. For a D-variety, X /D, with closed fiber X, we\nconsider the set Xn of sections of its structure morphism up to order n. By\nsections up to order n we mean morphisms over D from Spec k[t]/(tn+1 ) to\nX which make the following diagram commute\nq88 X\nqqq\nq\nq\nqqq\nqqq\n\u000f\u000f\n// D,\nSpec k[t]/(tn+1 )\n\nwhere the vertical arrow is the structure morphism of X .\nThe set Xn is the set of closed points of a k-variety (which we will also\ndenote by the same symbol Xn ), [9], Section 4.2. Naturally, X0 = X. The\nset X\u221e of sections of the structure morphism X \u2192 D is the projective limit\nof Xn 's, and therefore it is a set of closed points of a provariety over k (by\ndefinition, a provariety is a projective limit of a system of varieties; it is a\nscheme over k, which in our case is not of finite type). If X /D is of the form\nX \u00d7 D \u2192 D, with X \u2013 a k-variety, then we get the arc spaces described in\nthe introduction: Xn = Ln (X) and X\u221e = L(X).\nAs in the case of arc spaces, we have projection morphisms \u03c0nm : Xm \u2192 Xn\nm\nand \u03c0n : X \u2192 Xn for all m \u2265 n. (When n = 0, we shall write \u03c0X and \u03c0X\nn+1\nm\ninstead of \u03c00 , \u03c00 .) A fiber of \u03c0n lies in an affine space over the Zariski\ntangent space of the base point.\nRecall that a constructible subset of a variety V is a finite disjoint union\nof (Zariski) locally closed subvarieties of V .\nDefinition 1. A set A \u2282 X\u221e is called weakly stable at level n, if it is a union\nof fibers of \u03c0n : X \u2192 Xn , and \u03c0n (A) is constructible. A subset A \u2282 X\u221e is\ncalled stable at level n, if it is weakly stable at level n and for all m \u2265 n,\n\u03c0m+1 (A) \u2192 \u03c0m (A) is a piecewise trivial fibration over \u03c0m (A) with fiber Adk ,\nwhere d = dim X0 . (For a definition of piecewise trivial fibration, see [6],\np.6.) A set is called (weakly) stable if it is (weakly) stable at some level n.\nRemark 2. It immediately follows from the definition that a set which is\nstable at level n is also stable at level m for all m, m > n. If X /D is\nsmooth and of pure dimension, a weakly stable set is automatically stable\n(for smooth X , a fiber of the projection from Xn+1 to Xn is an affine space\nof dimension d = dim X over the tangent space of the base point, [15], p.4).\nIt is also worth mentioning that it is not obvious and not always true that\nL(X) is stable at level 0. The fact that it is stable at some level is a theorem\n(see e.g. [15], Proposition 3.1). When X is smooth, it follows from the proof\nof Proposition 3.1, [15] that L(X) is actually stable at level 0.\n1.2. The ring M\u0302. Now let us describe the ring M\u0302 where the measure\nwill take values. Let Vk denote the category of all varieties over k, and let\nK0 (Vk ) be the Grothendieck ring of this category. Let L = [A1 ] denote the\nisomorphism class of the affine line \u2013 an element in K0 (Vk ). The notation\n\n\f4\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\ncomes from its motivic interpretation: it corresponds to the so-called Lefschetz motive under the map from K0 (Vk ) to the ring of Chow motives, [16].\nConsider the localization of K0 (Vk ) at L: M = K0 (Vk )[L\u22121 ]. In order to get\na measure on an interesting algebra of subsets of X\u221e , we need to complete\nthe ring M. Given m \u2208 Z, let Fm M be the subgroup of M generated by the\nelements of the form [Z]L\u2212r with dim Z \u2264 m + r. This is a filtration of M\nas a ring: Fm M.Fn M \u2282 Fm+n M. This filtration is called the dimensional\nfiltration. Denote by M\u0302 the separated completion of M with respect to this\nfiltration, i.e.\nM\u0302 = lim M/Fm M.\n\u2190\u2212\n\nThis is called the dimensional completion. Our motivic measure will be\nM\u0302-valued.\nRemark 3. A recent work of F. Loeser and J. Sebag [14] suggests that it\nshould be possible to define a motivic measure that would take values in\nthe ring M, without the completion. However, we will not pursue this idea\nhere.\n1.3. A measure on the space of sections. Let A be a subset of X\u221e\nwhich is stable at level n. Observe that by definition of stability, the number\n(dim \u03c0m (A) \u2212 md) is independent of the choice of m \u2265 n (here d is the\ndimension of the closed fiber X of X ). We call this number the virtual\ndimension dim A of A. The class [\u03c0m (A)]L\u2212md \u2208 M also does not depend\non m; we denote it by \u03bc\u0303X (A). The collection of stable subsets of X\u221e is a\nBoolean ring (i.e., is closed under finite union and difference), on which \u03bc\u0303X\ndefines a finite additive measure.\nLet \u03bcX be the composition of \u03bc\u0303X and the completion map M \u2192 M\u0302. We\ncall it the motivic measure on X . A subset A \u2282 X\u221e is called measurable if\nfor every (negative) integer m there exists a stable subset Am \u2282 X\u221e and a\nsequence (Ci \u2282 X\u221e )\u221e\ni=0 of stable subsets such that the symmetric difference\nA\u2206Am is contained in \u222ai\u2208N Ci with dim Ci < m for all i and dim Ci \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nas i \u2192 \u221e.\nNow we cite the key proposition, which is a generalization of Denef and\nLoeser's theorem, [6].\nProposition 4. ([15], Proposition 2.2) The measurable subsets of X\u221e make\nup a Boolean subring and \u03bcX extends to a measure on this ring by\n\u03bcX (A) :=\n\nlim \u03bcX (Am ).\n\nm\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nIn particular, the above limit exists in M\u0302 and its value depends only on A.\nRemark 5. Notice that this definition of the measure differs from the one\nin [6] and [5] by a factor of Ld (with our normalization, the projection of\nthe motivic measure under \u03c0X is the \"tautological\" measure on X, as it was\ndescribed in the introduction).\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n5\n\n1.4. The transformation rule. The following crucial results from [15]\nshow that the additive function of sets \u03bcX possesses the properties expected\nof a measure in the classical sense.\nProposition 6. ([15], Proposition 3.1) For a D-variety X /D of pure relative\ndimension over D, the preimage of any constructible subset under \u03c0n : X\u221e \u2192\nXn is measurable. In particular, X\u221e is measurable. If Y \u2282 X is nowhere\ndense, then Y\u221e is of measure zero.\nFor X /D of pure relative dimension we have a notion of an integrable\nfunction \u03a6 : X\nP\u221e \u2192 M\u0302. This requires the fibers of \u03a6 to be measurable\nand the sum a \u03bcX (\u03a6\u22121 (a))a (a \u2208 M) to converge, i.e., at most countably many nonzero terms (\u03bcX (\u03a6\u22121 (ai )ai ))i\u2208N are allowed, and the condition \u03bcX (\u03a6\u22121 (ai ))ai \u2208 Fmi M\u0302 with limi\u2192\u221e mi = \u2212\u221e is required to hold.\nThe motivic integral of \u03a6 is then by definition the value of this series:\nZ\nX\n\u03a6 d\u03bcX =\n\u03bcX (\u03a6\u22121 (ai ))ai .\ni\n\nAn integrable function of particular interest arises from an ideal, I, in the\nstructure sheaf, OX , of X . Such an ideal defines a function ordI : X\u221e \u2192\nN \u222a {\u221e} by assigning to \u03b3 \u2208 X\u221e the multiplicity of \u03b3 \u2217 I as follows. Let \u03b3(o)\ndenote the \"constant term of \u03b3\", that is, the image of the closed point, o, of\nD in the closed fiber of X . The map \u03b3 \u2217 is the map of rings OX ,\u03b3(o) \u2192 k[[t]]\nthat induces \u03b3. Then \u03b3 \u2217 applied to I means the base change of I to k[[t]].\nThat is, \u03b3 \u2217 I is a sheaf on Spec k[[t]], whose stalk over the closed point\nis the k[[t]]-module k[[t]] \u2297OX ,\u03b3(o) M , where M is the OX ,\u03b3(o) -module that\ncorresponds, in the world of rings, to the stalk of I at \u03b3(o), and k[[t]] is\nan OX ,\u03b3(o) -module via the map \u03b3 \u2217 . An example of the function ordI when\nX = L(X), and I is the sheaf corresponding to a divisor, D, is considered\nin detail in Section 2.2 of [5] (where \u03b3 \u2217 I is denoted \u03b3 * D). The condition\nordI \u03b3 = n only depends on the n-jet of \u03b3, and it defines a constructible\nsubset Cn \u2282 Xn . It turns out that the set defined by ordI \u03b3 = \u221e is of\nmeasure zero, and the function L\u2212ordI is integrable.\nWe can now state the theorem that is key for all applications \u2013 the transformation rule. Let H : Y \u2192 X be a morphism of D-varieties of pure relative\ndimension d. We define the Jacobian ideal JH \u2282 OY of H as the 0-th Fitting ideal of the sheaf of relative differentials \u03a9Y/X (for definitions, see [10],\nII.8.9.2 and [8], Sections 16.1, 20.2).\nTheorem 7. ([15], Theorem 3.2) Let H : Y \u2192 X be a D-morphism of pure\ndimensional D-varieties with Y/D smooth. If A is a measurable\nR subset of Y\u221e\nwith H|A injective, then HA is measurable and \u03bcX (HA) = A L\u2212ordJH d\u03bcY .\nExample 8. Suppose H : L(Y ) \u2192 L(X) is induced by an isomorphism\nh : Y \u2192 X. Then H preserves the measure: \u03bcL(X) (HA) = \u03bcL(Y ) (A) for any\nmeasurable subset A \u2282 L(Y ).\n\n\f6\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nProof. An isomorphism of algebraic varieties induces an isomorphism on\ntheir tangent bundles. Hence, JH is trivial (i.e. it is the ideal sheaf that\ncoincides with the structure sheaf of L(Y )). The function L\u2212ordJH is identically equal to 1 on L(Y ) in this case.\nWe will need to use the transformation rule in a slightly more general situation, when Y is not smooth over D but is allowed to have a singularity in\nthe closed fiber. In this case, however, the set A will be assumed to be away\nfrom the singularity.\nFor a D-variety X of pure relative dimension d, we denote by J (X /D) the\nd-th Fitting ideal of \u03a9X /D . It defines the locus where X fails to be smooth\nover D, see [15], Section 9.\nLemma 9. Let H : Y \u2192 X be a D-morphism of pure dimensional Dvarieties; assume that the generic fiber of Y is smooth. Let A be a measurable subset of Y\u221e with H|A injective and such that for all \u03b3 \u2208 A, \u03b3(o) is\nin the regular\nof Y. Then the transformation rule holds for the set A:\nR locus\n\u2212ordJH\n\u03bcX (HA) = A L\nd\u03bcY .\n\nProof. We follow the proof of the transformation rule in [15]. The proof\nrests on the Key Lemma 9.2, and that is where the assumption that Y is\nsmooth appears first. Here is the statement of Lemma 9.2, [15]:\nSuppose Y/D is smooth and let A \u2282 Y\u221e be a stable subset of level l.\nAssume that H|A is injective and that ordJH |A is constant equal to e < \u221e.\nThen for n \u2265 sup{2e, l + e, ordJ (X /D) |HA }, Hn : \u03c0n A \u2192 Hn \u03c0n A has the\nstructure of affine-linear bundle of dimension e. (Here Hn is the trunctaion\nof the map H, that is, the map induced by H on Yn .)\nWe claim that the same statement holds if the assumption that Y is\nsmooth is replaced by the weaker assumption from the statement of our\nlemma.\nThere are two implications of smoothness of Y that are used in the proof\nof Lemma 9.2. The first one is that for all points \u03b3 \u2208 A, the O-module\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y/D is torsion-free, where O = k[[t]] (recall the definition of \u03b3 \u2217 applied\nto an ideal sheaf \u2013 it is basically the base change to k[[t]] using the map of\nrings \u03b3 \u2217 ). For this statement to hold for all \u03b3 \u2208 A, it is not necessary for\nY to be smooth over D. It is sufficient that \u03b3(o) is in Yreg and the generic\nfiber of Y is smooth. We show this by computing the dth Fitting ideal of\nthe k[[t]]-module \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y/D in the same way as as it is done in [15], Section\n9. Recall that J (Y/D) stands for the d-th Fitting ideal of \u03a9Y/D , where\nd is the relative dimension of Y. Since Fitting ideals commute with base\nchange, \u03b3 \u2217 (J (Y/D)) = Fittd (\u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y/D ). The latter Fitting ideal measures\nthe length of torsion of \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y/D : if a k[[t]]-module of rank d has torsion of\nlength e, its dth Fitting ideal is (te ). It remains to observe that the order\nwith respect to t of the ideal \u03b3 \u2217 (J (Y/D)) is the multiplicity of \u03b3 along the\nlocus defined by J (Y/D), that is, the singular locus of Y (see [15], Section\n9). By assumption, \u03b3 maps D to the regular part of Y, thus ordt \u03b3 \u2217 J (Y/D)\nis equal to 0.\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n7\n\nThe second implication of the smoothness of Y that is implicitly used in\nthe proof is that Lemma 9.1, [15] can be used with e = 0 in the notation\nof that lemma (in which e stands for the order of J (Y/D) along \u03b3). This\nproperty holds for any \u03b3 if Y is smooth; in our case it still holds for all \u03b3 \u2208 A\nby the assumption on A, as discussed above.\n1.5. k-spaces. Let G be a linear algebraic group. As noted in the introduction, the set of k-points of L(G) is in bijection with G(k[[t]]). With the use\nof the framework of k-spaces [2], more can be said. The following definitions\nare quoted from [2].\nLet k, as above, be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. By definition, a k-space (resp, k-group) is a functor from the category of k-algebras\nto the category of sets (resp., of groups) which is a sheaf for the faithfully flat\ntopology (see [2] for the details of the definition). The category of schemes\ncan be viewed as a full subcategory in the category of k-spaces. Direct limits\nexist in the category of k-spaces; we'll say that a k-space (resp., a k-group) is\nan ind-scheme (resp., ind-group) if it is the direct limit of a directed system\nof schemes. Note that an ind-group is not necessarily a limit of a directed\nsystem of algebraic groups. Let (X\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I be a directed system of schemes,\nX its limit in the category of k-spaces, and S a scheme. The set Mor(S, X)\nof morphisms of S into X is the direct limit of the sets Mor(S, X\u03b1 ), and the\nset Mor(X, S) is the inverse limit of the sets Mor(X\u03b1 , S).\n1.6. In [2], the k-group GLr (k((t))) is the functor on the category of kalgebras defined by R 7\u2192 GLr (R((t))), and the \"maximal compact subgroup\" GLr (k[[t]]) is the subfunctor R 7\u2192 GLr (R[[t]]). In order to avoid\nconfusion between the functor and the set of k((t))-points of GLr , we will\nchange the notation and denote the functors defined above by GLr ((t)) and\nGLr [[t]], respectively.\n(N )\nThere is a filtration of the k-group GLr ((t)) by the subfunctors GLr ,\n(N )\nwhere GLr (R) is the set of matrices A(t) in GLr (R((t))) such that both\nA(t) and A(t)\u22121 have noP\npoles of order greater than N , that is, all their\ni\nentries can be written as \u221e\ni=\u2212N ai t with ai \u2208 R.\nThe construction of the previous paragraph applies to any affine variety.\nIndeed, let X = Spec k[x1 , . . . , xd ]/I. For a k-algebra R, define X (N ) (R)\nto be the set of elements of Ad (R) satisfying the equations in I and having\npoles of order not greater than N in the sense defined above. By X((t))\nwe will denote the direct limit of X (N ) ; naturally, X((t)) is a subfunctor of\nAd ((t)).\nProposition 1.2 of [2] states that the k-group GLr [[t]] (GLr (k[[t]]) in the\nnotation of the authors) is represented by an affine group scheme and that\n(N )\n(GLr )N \u22650 are represented by schemes, making the the k-group GLr ((t))\nan ind-group. The proof uses only the fact that GLr is an affine variety: to\n(N )\nshow that GLr is represented by a scheme, one needs to think of GLr as\n\n\f8\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nthe closed subset of the affine space Mr \u00d7Mr (Mr being the space of all r\u00d7rmatrices) defined by the equation AB = Id. The equation AB = Id (which\nis, in fact, the system of r 2 equations in r 4 variables) can be substituted with\nany finite number of polynomial equations in d variables, and the proof will\ncarry over to any closed subvariety of Ad . Thus if X is closed in Ad , the\nk-space X((t)) is represented by the ind-scheme that is the direct limit of\nschemes representing the functors X (N ) . We will denote these schemes by\nthe same symbol X (N ) . The affine space Ad ((t)) itself and its filtration by\n(Ad )(N ) are discussed in detail in the next section.\nIn the case X = G \u2013 a reductive algebraic group, G((t)) is an ind-group.\nAll of the above is summarized in the following proposition; we omit its\nrigorous proof.\nProposition 10. Let G be a reductive algebraic group. Then L(G) is embedded in the ind-group G((t)), and G((t)) is a direct limit of affine schemes\n(G(N ) )N \u22650 in the category of k-spaces, with G(0) = L(G) representing G[[t]].\n1.7. The space Ad ((t)). We first focus our attention on affine space since\nwe used it above to define X((t)) for X an affine variety, and all the subsequent constructions will also be based upon it.\n1.7.1. We begin with the arc space of the affine line L(A1 ).\nBy definition, Ln (A1 ) represents the functor\nR \u2192 Mor(Spec R[t]/tn+1 R[t], A1 ) = Mor(k[x], R[t]/tn+1 R[t])\n\u223c\n= R[t]/tn+1 R[t] \u223c\n= Rn+1 .\nHence, Ln (A1 ) \u223c\n= An+1 , and the natural projection Ln+1 (A1 ) \u2192 Ln (A1 )\ncorresponds to the map R[t]/tn+2 R[t] \u2192 R[t]/tn+1 R[t] that takes P \u2208\nR[t]/tn+2 R[t] to (P mod tn+1 ), which, in turn, corresponds to the map\n(T0 , . . . , Tn+1 ) 7\u2192 (T0 , . . . , Tn ) from An+2 to An+1 . We conclude that the inverse limit of the system Ln (A1 ) coincides with the inverse limit of the spaces\nAn with natural projections. The latter is the scheme A\u221e = Spec k[T1 , T2 . . . ]\n(see e.g. [12] and references therein for a detailed treatment of A\u221e , but note\nthat all we will use here is its existence as a k-scheme).\n1.7.2. We can also consider A1 with its additive group structure, that is,\n(N )\nthe group Ga . Let Ga be the functor\nR \u2192 {elements of R((t)) with poles of order \u2264 N }.\nAn element of R((t)) with poles of order not greater than N is nothing but\na sequence of coefficients (a\u2212N , . . . , a0 , a1 , . . . ), where ai \u2208 R, i = 1, 2, . . . ;\nthus\nG(N ) \u223c\n= Spec k[T\u2212N , . . . , T0 , . . . ] \u223c\n= Spec k[T0 , T1 , . . . ] = G(0) \u223c\n= L(Ga ).\na\n\na\n\nAd ((t))\n\nAn analogous argument works for\nwith d \u2208 N. In particular, (Ad )(N )\nis isomorphic over k to L(Ad ) for all N \u2208 N. Denote this isomorphism by\nSN .\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n9\n\n1.7.3. Recall the notations: F = k((t)), D = Spec k[[t]]. If R is a k-algebra,\nby R-points of a k-space we will simply mean the set which is an image of R\n(recall that a k-space is a functor from k-algebras to sets). In all that follows\nwe will be mostly concerned with the set of k-points of Ad ((t)), because this\nset is in bijection with Ad (F ).\nSo far, we have described one way of thinking of Ad ((t))(k): as a union\nof the sets of k-points of the schemes over k forming the directed system\n(Ad )(N ) . Each isomorphism SN between (Ad )(N ) and (Ad )(0) = L(Ad ) induces a bijection on the sets of their k-points, shifting the indices of a power\nseries corresponding to a given point by N to the right. We recall that\nL(Ad ) = (Spec k[T0 , . . . , Tn , . . . ])d . Now observe that the set of k-points of\nL(Ad ) is in natural bijection with the set of k[[t]]-points of the affine space Ad\nas a scheme over k[[t]], that is, of Spec k[[t]][x1 , . . . , xd ]. This gives another,\nsometimes more convenient, way of looking at k-points of Ad ((t)).\nFix a positive integer N and consider the k[[t]]-morphism S\u0303N from\nSpec k[[t]][u1 , . . . , ud ] to Spec k[[t]][x1 , . . . , xd ] (i.e., to itself), induced by the\nmap of rings xi 7\u2192 tN ui , i = 1,..,d. On k[[t]]-points (which are again viewed\nas d-tuples of power series with coefficients in k), this map induces multiplication by tN , that is, a shift of all indices to the right by N . Observe that,\neven though it is not an injective map of k[[t]]-schemes, on k[[t]]-points it is\nan injection. Thus, if we take two copies of Ad over k[[t]] and the morphism\nS\u0303N between them, we can identify the set of k[[t]]-points of the image of S\u0303N\nwith k-points of L(Ad ), and then the set of k[[t]]-points of the source copy\nof Ad will be naturally identified with the set of k-points of (Ad )(N ) . This is\nan alternative description of the map induced on k-points of (Ad )(N ) by the\nisomorphism SN : (Ad )(N ) \u2192 L(Ad ).\n1.8. Morphisms. By definition, G((t)) is a k-space, that is, a functor.\nThen a morphism between two such objects is a morphism of functors (a\nnatural transformation). However, we can use the fact that G((t)) is represented by an ind-scheme. By a morphism between two affine ind-schemes\nX = lim Xi and Y = lim Yi we shall mean a map of sets \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y such\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\nthat each \u03c6(Xi ) is contained in some Yj , and the induced map Xi \u2192 Yj is a\nmorphism of schemes.\nLet G be an algebraic group. Then we can define an action of G(F )\n(the group of k((t))-points of G) on the ind-group G((t)) by left or right\ntranslations in the same way as it is done for group schemes, see e.g. Section\n4.2 of [3].\n2. A construction of the motivic measure on G((t))\nWe begin with a construction of an additively invariant motivic measure\non the affine space Ad ((t)). Then we use the structure theory of G to reduce\nthe problem of constructing a measure on G((t)) to the construction on\nAd ((t)).\n\n\f10\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\n2.1. Haar measure on the affine space. The algebra of measurable subsets of the space L(X) was defined in Appendix in [6] for any variety X.\nIn particular, we have an algebra of measurable sets in L(Ad ). However,\nnotice that in [6], the expression \"a subset of a scheme\" means a subset of\nthe underlying topological space, whereas for us (as well as in [15]) a subset\nof L(X) is a subset of the set of closed points of L(X), since it is the set\nof closed points of L(X) which is in bijection with the set of sections of the\nstructure morphism X \u00d7Spec k D \u2192 D. We obtain the algebra of measurable\nsubsets (in our sense) of L(X) by taking the intersection of all elemets of\nthe algebra of sets defined in [6] with the set of closed points of L(X). In\ngeneral, by a subset of an ind-scheme X which is a direct limit of k-schemes\nX (N ) we shall mean an increasing union of subsets of the sets of closed points\nof the schemes X (N ) .\nDefinition 11. We call a subset of Ad ((t)) bounded measurable if it is\ncontained in (Ad )(N ) for some N and its image under the isomorphism\n(Ad )(N ) \u2192 L(Ad ) defined in 1.7.2 is a measurable subset of L(Ad ) as defined in Section 1.3.\n2.1.1. Bounded measurable subsets form an algebra of sets (closed only\nunder finite unions, though). In order to define a measure on this algebra,\nwe need to calculate the volumes of some special subsets of L(Ad ). We do\nit in the case d = 1 first.\nExample 12. Let X = L(Ga ), and denote the corresponding motivic measure (from Proposition 4) by \u03bc\u0303a . Consider a decreasing filtration of Ga (k[[t]])\nby the subsets tn k[[t]], n = 0, 1, . . . . Denote the corresponding algebraic\nsubsets of L(Ga ) by Bn , so that the set of k-points of Bn is tn k[[t]]. Let us\ncalculate their volumes. The set Bn (n \u2208 N) is precisely the fiber of L(Ga )\nover the point 0n\u22121 = (0, . . . , 0) \u2208 Ln\u22121 (Ga ). Hence, by definition,\n\u03bc\u0303a (Bn ) = L\u2212n+1 [\u03c0n\u22121 (Bn )] = L\u2212n+1 [{pt}]\n= L\u2212n+1 1 = L\u2212n+1 .\nThe total volume \u03bc\u0303a (L(Ga )) is by definition [A1 ]L0 = L, so we have\n(1)\n\n\u03bc\u0303a (Bn ) = L\u2212n \u03bc\u0303a (L(Ga )).\n\n2.1.2. Now we can define a motivic measure on Ga ((t)). We keep the\n(N )\nnotation of the previous example. Let A be a measurable subset of Ga ,\n(0)\ni.e., its image B = SN (A) in Ga = L(A1 ) is measurable. Then we set\n(2)\n\n\u03bca (A) = LN \u03bc\u0303a (B).\n(N \u22121)\n\n(N )\n\nOn the level of rings, the inclusion Ga\n\u0592\u2192 Ga corresponds to the map\ninduced by T\u2212N 7\u2192 0 from k[T\u2212N , T\u2212N +1 , . . . ] to k[T\u2212N +1 , . . . ]. The map\n(N )\nSN identifies the scheme Ga with L(Ga ), and therefore the image of its\n(N \u22121)\nmaps isomorphically onto the fiber of L(Ga ) over 0, that\nsubset Ga\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n11\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(M )\n= BN \u2212M . Then the\nis, the set B1 . Similarly, for M < N , SN Ga\n(N )\n\nrelation (1) guarantees that the volume \u03bca (Ga ) is well defined. A similar\n(N )\ncalculation applied to an arbitrary measurable subset of Ga would show\nthat the measure \u03bca is well defined.\n\nRemark 13. It is possible to arrive at the same conclusions without writing\ndown the sets Bn and their volumes explicitly, but by using the transformation rule and the following lemma.\nLemma 14. The order of Jacobian ordt JS\u0303N (\u03b3) of the map S\u0303N : L(Ad ) \u2192\nL(Ad ) is equal to N d for all \u03b3 \u2208 L(Ad ).\nProof. As in 1.7.3, we think of the closed points of L(Ad ) as sections of\nthe structure morphism of the scheme Spec k[[t]][x1 , . . . , xd ] over k[[t]]. We\nhave the map S\u0303N : Spec B \u2192 Spec A, where A = k[[t]][x1 , . . . , xd ], B =\nk[[t]][u1 , . . . , ud ], xi 7\u2192 tN ui . There is an exact sequence of modules of\ndifferentials ([8], Section 16.1):\n\u03a9A/k[[t]] \u2297A B \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03a9B/k[[t]] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03a9B/A \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0.\nWe see that \u03a9B/A is a torsion B-module, and the above exact sequence is\nits free presentation. Hence Fitt0 (\u03a9B/A ) = (det(tN Id)) = (tN d ) \u2282 B by [8],\nSection 20.2. Therefore the Jacobian ideal of the map S\u0303N is the ideal sheaf\n(tN d ) on Spec B. Let \u03b3 : Spec k[[t]] \u2192 Spec k[[t]][u1 , . . . , ud ] be a section.\nThe stalk of JS\u0303N at every point is the ideal (tN d ) in the local ring of that\npoint, i.e., it is an ideal of k[[t]] embedded into the local ring of the point.\nAny section \u03b3 fixes k[[t]] by definition, so the pullback of JS\u0303N to k[[t]] by \u03b3\nis the ideal (tN d ) itself. Thus ordt JS\u0303N (\u03b3) = N d.\n2.1.3. Recall the notation: \u03bc\u0303a is the canonical measure on L(Ad ) (see\nProposition 4).\nDefinition 15. Let A \u2282 (Ad )(N ) be a bounded measurable subset. Then\ndefine\n\u03bca (A) = LN d \u03bc\u0303a (SN (A)).\nLemma 16. The measure \u03bca is well defined and additively invariant.\nProof. The first statement is proved exactly the same way as in 2.1.2. The\ninvariance follows from the transformation rule, but it is also easy to check\nthis statement by hand, using the explicit definition of the measure \u03bca and\nthe fact that translations are isomorphisms.\nRemark 17. By invariance here we mean that the translates of bounded\nmeasurable subsets are again bounded measurable, of the same measure.\nIt is now possible to define the full algebra of measurable sets in Ad ((t)).\n\n\f12\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nDefinition 18. We call a subset B \u2282 Ad ((t)) measurable if it can be\nrepresented as a disjoint countable union of bounded\nP\u221emeasurable subsets\nB = \u222an\u2208N Bn , such that the series of their measures i=1 \u03bca (Bn ) converges\nP\nin the ring M\u0302. The measure of B is defined as \u03bca (B) = \u221e\nn=1 \u03bca (Bn ).\n\nThe proof that \u03bca (B) does not depend on a particular collection Bn mimics\nstandard measure theory, with the use of a norm on M\u0302 introduced in the\nAppendix in [6]. It is easy to see that the measure \u03bca extended to the\n\u03c3-algebra of measurable sets is still translation-invariant.\n\n2.2. Notation. Let X be an affine variety, X((t)) \u2013 the ind-scheme defined\nas in 1.6, and U \u2013 a Zariski open subset of X with Z = X \\ U closed. Then\nZ((t)) is a subfunctor of X((t)). By CX (U ) we will denote the ind-scheme\nwhich is the direct limit of the schemes X (N ) \\ Z (N ) \u2013 that is, the \"complement of Z((t)) in X((t))\". We shall denote by C0X (U ) the complement\nof Z[[t]] in X[[t]]. Notice that C0X (U ) is not the same as U [[t]] \u2013in general,\nit is much larger. By the construction, there is an inclusion morphism of\nind-schemes CX (U ) \u0592\u2192 X((t)). Later we will slighly abuse the terminology\nby thinking of CX (U ) as a measurable subset of X((t)), meaning that the\nset of closed points of CX (U ) can be thought of as a subset of the set of\nclosed points of X((t)).\nExample 19. X = A1 , Z = {0}, U = X \\ Z. Then L(U ) is the set B1 from\nExample 12, that is, the fiber of \u03c0X over 0 \u2208 L0 (X), so its motivic volume is\ndifferent from the volume of X. However, C0X (U ) is the complement of L(Z)\nin L(A1 ), that is, a complement of a single point, so the motivic volume of\nC0X (U ) coincides with the motivic volume of A1 .\nIn this example, CX (U ) = U ((t)) is the functor that assigns to every ring\nR the set of Laurent series with coefficients in R such that at least one of\nthe coefficients is a unit in R. Also, notice that U ((t)) \u2229 L(X) = C0X (U ).\n2.3. Once and for all, we choose the standard coordinates x1 ,..,xd on Ad .\nLet \u03c9 be a top degree differential form \u03c9 = gdx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxd defined on a\nZariski open subset U \u2282 Ad , where g is a regular function on U . Then define\nthe measure \u03bc|\u03c9| on CAd (U ) by\nZ\n(3)\nL\u2212ordt (g\u25e6\u03b3) d\u03bca (\u03b3),\n\u03bc|\u03c9| (A) =\nA\n\nwhere \u03bca is the motivic measure on Ad ((t)), A is a bounded measurable set\ncontained in CAd (U ); ordt (g \u25e6 \u03b3) for \u03b3 \u2208 (Ad )(N ) is the order of vanishing of\nthe formal power series g(\u03b3) at t = 0 (if the series has a pole at t = 0, the\norder is negative).\nIn this notation, the measure on Ad ((t)) defined in 2.1.3 is the one that\ncorresponds to the form dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxd .\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n13\n\nBy definition of the measure \u03bca , the integral in (3) can be written as\nZ\nZ\n\u2212ordt (g\u25e6\u03b3)\n(4)\nL\u2212ordt (g\u0303\u25e6\u03b3)+N d d\u03bca (\u03b3)\nL\nd\u03bca (\u03b3) =\n\u03bc|\u03c9| (A) =\nA\n\nSN (A)\n\nfor any N \u2265 0, where g\u0303(tN x1 , . . . , tN xd ) = g(x1 , . . . , xd ). In particular,\nsince for a bounded set A the number N can be chosen big enough to ensure\nSN (A) \u2282 L(Ad ), the motivic integral in the right-hand side of (4) exists\n(see [5]), and therefore the integral in (3) is also defined (we can use the\nright-hand side of (4) as its definition).\n2.4. A coordinate system on the big cell. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over k. Let T \u2282 G be a maximal torus (recall\nthat the field k is assumed algebraically closed, so T is automatically split),\nm \u2013 its dimension, \u2206 \u2013 a choice of simple roots of the Lie algebra of G, n \u2013\nthe cardinality of \u2206, B \u2283 T \u2013 the Borel subgroup corresponding to \u2206, U \u2013\nits unipotent radical, B \u2212 \u2013 the opposite Borel subgroup with respect to T ,\nU \u2212 \u2013 its unipotent radical. Then ([11], p.174), the product morphism is an\nisomorphism of algebraic varieties\nU \u2212 \u00d7 T \u00d7 U \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 ,\nwhere \u03a9\u2032 \u2282 G is a Zariski open subset (a big cell). For our purposes, it is\nmore convenient to consider its conjugate, the set \u03a9 = U \u2212 \u00d7 U \u00d7 T . The\nunipotent subgroup U (respectively, U \u2212 ) is isomorphic to a cartesian product of root subgroups U\u03b1 corresponding to positive (respectively, negative)\nroots. Choose a generator for each U\u03b1 , and denote it by x\u2032\u03b1 if \u03b1 is positive,\nand by y\u03b1\u2032 if \u03b1 is negative. Each U\u03b1 can be identified with a one-dimensional\nsubspace g\u03b1 in the Lie algebra of G. Denote by x\u03b1 (resp., y\u03b1 ) the generator of g\u03b1 that corresponds to x\u2032\u03b1 (resp., y\u03b1\u2032 ) under this isomorphism. This\ndefines a coordinate system on U \u2212 \u00d7 U . Next, choose a coordinate system\ns1 ,..,sm on T by representing it as a product of m copies of Gm and choosing\na coordinate sj on each of them. Hence we have defined a coordinate map\ni : \u03a9 \u2192 Ad , d = 2n + m. It is defined over k. The image of this map is the\nZariski open subset of Ad defined by s1 * . . . * sm 6= 0.\n2.5. Let \u03a9 be the big cell of G, as in the previous subsection. Denote by\nZ the complement of \u03a9 in G \u2013 a constructible subset which is a union of\na finite number of closed subvarieties of G defined over k. Recall from 1.6\nthat the set of F -points of G can be identified with the set of k-points of the\nind-group G((t)), which is a direct limit of the system (G(N ) )N \u22650 . Under\nthis bijection the set \u03a9(F ) is identified with the set of k-points of CG (\u03a9).\nWe recall from 2.2 that by definition G((t)) = CG (\u03a9) \u222a Z((t)). Observe that\nthe map i from the previous subsection extends to a map from CG (\u03a9) to\nAd ((t)); it is still a map over k, and we will denote it by the same letter i.\n\n\f14\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nLet \u03c9 be a 1-form on \u03a9 that is defined by the following expression in the\ncoordinates (x,y,s) defined in 2.4:\n(5)\n\u03c9 = dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxn \u2227 dy1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dyn \u2227\n\ndsm\nds\nds1\n\u2227 *** \u2227\n=: dx \u2227 dy \u2227 .\ns1\nsm\ns\n\nLemma 20. The form \u03c9 is invariant under left and right translations on\nG.\nWe omit the proof.\nRecall that by a subset of the ind-scheme G((t)) we mean a union of\nsubsets of closed points of the schemes G(N ) . Now we are ready to define a\nmotivic measure on G((t)).\nDefinition 21. Let B be a subset of G((t)). We say that B is \u03a9-measurable\nif B can be represented as a (disjoint) union B = C \u222a A, where C \u2282 Z((t))\nand A is a measurable subset of CG (\u03a9). Here we say that a subset A of\nCG (\u03a9) is measurable if its image i(A) is a measurable subset of Ad ((t)). For\nB = C \u222a A \u2013 measurable, set\n(6)\n\n\u03bc\u03a9 (B) = \u03bc|(i\u22121 )\u2217 (\u03c9)| (i(A)).\n\nWe call a measurable subset bounded, if it is contained in CG (\u03a9) and its\nimage under the map i is a bounded measurable subset of Ad ((t)).\nProposition 22. Let g be an element of G(F ), and let A be a bounded\n\u03a9-measurable set in CG (\u03a9) such that g\u22121 A is also contained in CG (\u03a9) and\nbounded. Then \u03bc\u03a9 (A) = \u03bc\u03a9 (g\u22121 A).\nProof. Let us denote by Lg the left translation by g viewed as an automorphism of G defined over the field F . On the open subset \u03a9 \u2229 g\u22121 \u03a9 it can be\nrepresented as a rational map in the coordinates x, y, s that were defined in\n2.4. We denote this map by h(x, y, s), and its Jacobian matrix by J. More\nprecisely, h is a birational map from Ad to Ad over F defined by the formula\nh(x, y, s) = i(Lg (i\u22121 (x, y, s))). Thus det J is an F -valued regular function\non \u03a9, and by Lemma 20, we have\n(7)\n\np(h(x, y, s)) * det J * dx \u2227 dy \u2227 ds = p(x, y, s)dx \u2227 dy \u2227 ds,\n\nwhere p(x, y, s) = 1/s1 . . . sm . Now the goal is to represent the restriction\nof the map Lg to the given set g\u22121 A as a restriction of a k[[t]]-morphism\nof D-varieties, so that the transformation rule for motivic measures can be\napplied to it.\nThe sets A and g\u22121 A are both contained in CG (\u03a9) and are bounded by\nassumption. By definition, this means that i(A) is a measurable subset of\n(Ad )(N ) for some N \u2265 0, and that i(g\u22121 A) is defined and is contained in\n(Ad )(M ) for some M \u2265 0. We choose both integers M , N to be minimal\npossible. Also, we can assume without loss of generality that A is stable.\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n15\n\nWe will need the expression h(t\u2212M x, t\u2212M y, t\u2212M s). We write it in the\nform\n!\nf \u0303d (x, y, s)\nf \u03031 (x, y, s)\n\u2212M\n\u2212M\n\u2212M\n(8)\n,\n,...,\nh(t x, t y, t s) =\n\u2206(x, y, s)\n\u2206(x, y, s)\nwhere f \u0303i , i = 1, .., d and \u2206 are in k[[t]][x, y, s], and gcd(f \u03031 , .., f \u0303d , \u2206) = 1.\nLet us break up the set A according to the order of vanishing of \u2206 on\nSM (i(g\u22121 A)):\nA = \u222ae\u22650 Ae ,\nA0 = {\u03b3 \u2208 A | ordt \u2206(SM \u25e6 i \u25e6 g \u22121 \u03b3) \u2264 0};\nAe = {\u03b3 \u2208 A | ordt \u2206(SM \u25e6 i \u25e6 g \u22121 \u03b3) = e} for e \u2265 1.\nNow we are ready to construct, for each e = 0, 1, . . . , a scheme Xe over\nD and two D-morphisms H1 and H2 from Xe to Ad [[t]], such that the the\nfollowing conditions hold:\n(i) There exists a measurable subset B of (Xe )\u221e such that H1 induces a\nbijection between B and SM (i(g\u22121 Ae )).\n(ii) The morphism H2 induces a bijection between B and Se (i(Ae )).\n(iii) The following diagram (of maps of sets) commutes:\n\nSM (i(g \u22121 Ae )) \u271b\n\nH1\n\nB\n\nH2\n\n\u2732 Se (i(A))\n\n\u273b\n\n\u273b\n\nSM\n\nSe\n\ni(g\u22121 Ae )\n\n\u2732\n\nh\n\ni(Ae )\n\nDefine the scheme Xe to be\nXe = Spec k[[t]][x1 , .., xn , y1 , .., yn , s1 , .., sm , z]/(z\u2206 \u2212 te ).\nLet H1 : Xe \u2192 Ad [[t]] = Spec k[[t]][u1 , .., ud ] be the morphism of schemes\ninduced by the identity map on the first d variables:\n(9) ui 7\u2192 xi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n; ui 7\u2192 yi\u2212n , n + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n; ui 7\u2192 si\u22122n , 2n < i \u2264 d.\nWhen e = 0, the map H1 is nothing but the inclusion morphism of the open\nsubset of Ad [[t]] defined by \u2206 6= 0 into Ad [[t]].\nLet H2 : Xe \u2192 Ad [[t]] = Spec k[[t]][u1 , .., ud ] be the morphism defined by\n(10)\n\nui 7\u2192 z f \u0303i (x, y, s),\n\ni = 1, . . . , d.\n\n\f16\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nNaturally, H1 induces a bijection on k[[t]]-points. Let B \u2282 (Xe )\u221e be the\npreimage of the set SM (i(g \u22121 Ae )) under this bijection. Then it immediately follows from the definition of H2 that the property (iii) holds (re\u22121\n\u22121\ncall that SM is a bijection\n\u0010  \u0303 between\n\u0011 the sets i(ge Ae ) and SM (i(g Ae ));\n \u0303\nt\n\"). Since the map h is a\nh(t\u2212M x, t\u2212M y, t\u2212M s) = f\u22061 , .., f\u2206d , and \"z = \u2206\ncoordinate expression of a translation by a group element, it is a bijection;\nthus the commutativity of the diagram implies that H2 induces a bijection\nbetween the set B and the set Se (i(Ae )).\nIn the case e = 0 the scheme Xe is smooth over D. For e > 0, Xe has\nsmooth generic fiber, and the singular locus in its closed fiber is defined by\nthe equations \u2206(x, y, s) = z = 0. We observe that the z-coordinate of \u03b3(o)\n(the image of the closed point of D) is not equal to zero for any element\n\u03b3 of the set B since \u2206 is assumed to vanish exactly up to order e on the\nimage of \u03b3 in SM (i(g\u22121 Ae )). That is, \u03b3(o) does not lie in the singular locus\nof the closed fiber of Xe . Since A is assumed to be stable, the set B is\nalso stable: the condition ordt \u2206(\u03b3) = e depends only on the e-jet of \u03b3.\nIndeed, the stability of A implies the stability of all the sets Ae . The only\nformal difference between B and Ae is that the points in B have an extra\ncoordinate z = z0 + z1 t + * * * + zn tn + . . . , and satisfy an extra equation\nz\u2206(x, y, s) = te . By our assumption on Ae and by the definition of B, the\norder of \u2206/te is equal to 0. Hence, if n > e, each equation in zn+1 of the\nform (z0 + * * * + zn+1 tn+1 + . . . )\u2206(x, y, s) = te + tn+1 g(t), g(t) \u2208 k[[t]] with\nfixed x, y, s and fixed z0 ,...,zn has a unique solution. Therefore, the set B\nis stable at level e or the level of A, whichever is greater.\nIt follows now from Lemma 9 that the transformation rule can be applied\nto the restriction of the morphisms H1 and H2 to the set B. Let us denote\nthe motivic measure on Xe that was defined in Section 1.3 by d\u03bce , and the\nmotivic measure on Ad [[t]] \u2013 by d\u03bca , as before. By the transformation rule,\nwe have\n(11)\nd\u03bca |SM (i(g\u22121 Ae )) = L\u2212ordJH1 d\u03bce |B ,\n(12)\n\nd\u03bca |Se (i(Ae )) = L\u2212ordJH2 d\u03bce |B .\n\nIt remains to calculate JH1 and JH2 . We start with the Jacobian of H1 .\nLet R1 be the ring R1 = k[[t]][u1 , .., ud ], and let\nR2 = k[[t]][x1 , .., xn , y1 , .., yn , s1 , .., sm , z]/(z\u2206 \u2212 te ). By definition, JH1 is\nthe 0-th Fitting ideal of the module \u03a9R2 /R1 , where the map R1 \u2192 R2 is\ngiven by the formula (9). We have the exact sequence\n(13)\n\n\u03a9R1 /k[[t]] \u2297R1 R2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03a9R2 /k[[t]] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03a9R2 /R1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0.\n\nHence, \u03a9R2 /R1 is in this case a torsion R2 -module isomorphic to R2 [\u03c3]/\u03c3\u2206.\nIts 0th Fitting ideal is (\u2206). Notice that by the remark on definition of the\nset B earlier in this proof, ordt (\u03b3 \u2217 \u2206) = e for all \u03b3 \u2208 B.\nLet us now calculate the Jacobian of H2 . The rings R1 and R2 remain the same, but the map R1 \u2192 R2 is given by the formula (10) now.\nThen \u03a9R2 /R1 is the R2 -module generated over R2 by the formal symbols\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n17\n\ndx1 , . . . , dxn , dy1 , . . . , dyn , ds1 , . . . , dsm , dz with the relations obtained by\nsetting to zero the the formal derivatives of the polynomials z\u2206 and\nz f \u0303i (x, y, s), i = 1, . . . , d.

We can represent it as a disjoint\nunion of bounded subsets of CG (\u03a9): E = \u222a\u221e\nN =0 EN with E0 = E \u2229 L(G)\nand EN = E \u2229 (\u03a9(N ) \\ \u03a9(N \u22121) ) for N \u2265 1. It remains to observe that\nSN (i(EN )) is well defined and it is a locally closed subscheme of L(Ad ). Its\nrelative dimension over k[[t]] is less than d, and therefore by definition of\nthe measure on the affine space we have \u03bca (SN (i(EN ))) = 0. This implies\n\u03bc\u03a9 (EN ) = 0 for all N \u2265 1; hence \u03bc\u03a9 (E) = 0.\nCorollary 24. The algebra of \u03a9-measurable sets and the measure \u03bc\u03a9 itself\ndo not depend on the choice of the torus T or the set of positive roots (that\nis, \u03a9 can be dropped from the notation).\nProof. Follows from the theorem and the fact that all the big cells are\nconjugate in G over k (recall that we are assuming k to be algebraically\nclosed).\n2.6. As stated in the introduction, the goal was to define a motivic measure\non G((t)) that would extend the canonical motivic measure on L(G). The\nfollowing theorem shows that we have achieved it.\nTheorem 25. Let \u03a9 be any big cell in the group G. Then L(G) is \u03a9measurable, and the restriction of \u03bc\u03a9 to L(G) coincides with the canonical\nmotivic measure on L(G).\nProof. Let us denote the canonical motivic measure on L(G) by \u03bcG . Denote\nthe complement of \u03a9 in G by Z, as before. First, notice that \u03bcG (L(Z)) = 0\nby the axioms of the canonical measure; L(G) = L(Z) \u222a (CG (\u03a9) \u2229 L(G)),\nand \u03bc\u03a9 (Z) = 0 by definition of \u03bc\u03a9 . Therefore, we only need to show that\nthe restrictions of \u03bc\u03a9 and \u03bcG to CG (\u03a9) \u2229 L(G) coincide (and are defined on\nthe same algebra of sets).\nConsider the multiplication map U \u2212 \u00d7 U \u00d7 T \u2192 G over k. This map is an\nisomorphism between An \u00d7An \u00d7Gm\nm and \u03a9 over k. It induces an isomorphism\n(over k[[t]]) of the arc spaces: L(An ) \u00d7 L(An ) \u00d7 L(Gm\nm ) \u2192 L(\u03a9). If we apply\nthe transformation rule to this isomorohism, we immediately obtain that the\n\n\fHAAR MEASURE\n\n19\n\nrestrictions of \u03bc\u03a9 and \u03bcG to L(\u03a9) coincide, by Example 8 and the observation\nthat ordt (s1 . . . sm ) = 1 on Gm\nm [[t]].\nSince L(\u03a9) is a smaller set than CG (\u03a9) \u2229 L(G), the equality between the\ntwo measures restricted to L(\u03a9) is not enough. However, we claim that a\nfinite number of translates of L(\u03a9) cover the whole arc space of G, and then\nthe theorem follows immediately.\nThe claim can be proved, for example, as follows. At first consider the\nsituation over k. All possible big cells cover the group G(k) (recall that\nk is assumed algebraically closed, and hence even Borel subgroups cover\nG(k)). Since G is quasicompact in Zariski topology, and the big cells are\nZariski open, there exists a finite subcover by some big cells \u03a91 (k),..,\u03a9n (k).\nThe arc space L(G) itself is stable at level 0 since G is a smooth variety,\nand so are L(\u03a91 ),..,L(\u03a9n ), by Remark 2. In particular, L(G) = \u03c00\u22121 (G),\nL(\u03a9i ) = \u03c00\u22121 (\u03a9i ), i = 1, . . . , n. It follows that \u222ani=1 L(\u03a9i ) = L(G). Hence,\nany \u03bcG -measurable subset A of L(G) can be broken up into a disjoint union\nA = \u222ani=1 Ai with Ai \u2282 L(\u03a9i ) \u2013 \u03a9i -measurable. By Corollary 24, any \u03a9i measurable set is also \u03a9-measurable, and \u03bc\u03a9 (Ai ) = \u03bc\u03a9i (Ai ) for any i =\n1, . . . , n. On the other hand, we have shown\nP in the beginning of this proof\nthat \u03bc\u03a9i (Ai ) = \u03bcG (Ai ). Hence, \u03bc\u03a9 (A) = ni=1 \u03bcG (Ai ) = \u03bcG (A).\n\nRemark 26. 1. It is possible to construct explicitly the finite number of\ntranslates of the given big cell \u03a9 that cover L(G). It can be done by means\nof Bruhat decomposition and the following statement ([4], Section 2.1, p.43):\nif w, s are elements of the Weyl group of G satisfying l(s) = 1 and l(sw) =\nl(w) + 1, and n \u2208 G is a representative of s, then nBwB is contained in\nB(sw)B (here B is a fixed Borel subgroup, and l(w) stands for length of w).\n2. The statement of the last theorem can be proved directly by a Jacobian\ncalculation in a way similar to the proof of Proposition 22. Namely, after\nhaving established the equality of the two measures on L(\u03a9), we could subdivide the remaining part of L(G) \u2229 \u03a9((t)) into a disjoint union of subsets\naccording to the order of pole of \u03a9-coordinates of its elements, and then\nrepeat the procedure described in Proposition 22: construct an auxilliary\nD-variety corresponding to each piece with a given order of pole and a k[[t]]morphism from it to L(G) which corresponds to the natural inclusion of the\nbig cell into G. A complicated calculation shows that the Jacobian ideal\nof this morphism coincides with the principal ideal generated by (s1 . . . sm )\n(recall that s1 , . . . , sm are the coordinates of the torus component of the\ngiven element of the big cell). Then the statement follows from the Jacobian\ntransformation rule applied to this morphism.\n2.7. Concluding remarks. Finally, I would like to mention briefly a few\nclosely related questions which have not been discussed so far, and which I\nhope to return to in the future.\n2.7.1. Uniqueness. The classical Haar measure is unique up to a scalar multiple. The canonical motivic measure on L(G) is unique because it is normalized in such a way that it projects to the tautological measure on the\n\n\f20\n\nJULIA GORDON\n\nvariety G. Our construction of the motivic measure on G((t)) gives an\nanswer that does not depend on the choice of the big cell (Corollary 24)\nand coincides with the unique motivic measure on L(G). However, at the\nmoment I have no proof (and not even a precise formulation) of a general\nuniqueness statement.\n2.7.2. The assumptions that the ground field k is algebraically closed and\nhas characteristic 0 were adopted because we followed the exposition of [15]\nwhere these assumptions were made. However, it should be possible to extend our result without any difficulty to the case when k is not algebraically\nclosed but the group G is assumed split over F . It would also be interesting\nto construct a motivic Haar measure for reductive groups that are not split\nover F .\nReferences\n[1] V.
