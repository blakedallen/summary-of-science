By virtue of Dirac's representation theory and the coherent state'\nproperty we derive a general formula for finding Mexican hat wavelets.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWavelet is a 'small wave' which is localized in both time and frequency space[1, 2, 3]. It\nis this unique characteristic that makes wavelets analysis in some ways superior to Fourier\nanalysis which employs 'big waves' (sinusoid or cosine), e.g., wavelets are particularly useful\nwhen processing data with sharp discontinuities or compressing image data. Mathematically,\na wavelet \u03c8 of the real variable x must satisfy the following admissibility condition\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c8 (x) dx = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich suggests that \u03c8 (x) behaves like a wave, and in contrast to sinusoid, it decreases rapidly\nto zero as |x| tends to infinity. The theory of wavelets is concerned with the representation\nof a function in terms of a two-parameter family of dilates and translates of a fixed function,\nwhich is usually known as the \"mother wavelet\". A family of wavelets \u03c8(\u03bc,s) (\u03bc > 0 is a\n1\n\n\f0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n2\n\n4\n\nx\n\n\u20130.2\n\nfig. 1:\nscaling parameter, s is a translation parameter, s \u2208 R) are constructed from the mother\nwavelet \u03c8, and the dilated-translated functions are defined as\n!\n\n1\nx\u2212s\n\u03c8(\u03bc,s) (x) = \u221a \u03c8\n,\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\nand the wavelet integral transform of a signal function f (x) \u2208 L2 (R) by \u03c8(\u03bc,s) is defined by\n1\nW\u03c8 f (\u03bc, s) = \u221a\n\u03bc\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nf (x) \u03c8\n\n\u2217\n\n!\n\nx\u2212s\ndx.\n\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nThe admissibility condition (1) ensures that the inverse transform and Parseval formula are\napplicable. When \u03c8 (x) is an odd function of x, it satisfies (1) obviously. A typical \u03c8 (x),\nwhich is an even function of x, is the Mexican hat wavelet (see fig. 1)\n\u0011\n\n(4)\n\n1 \u2212 x2 dx = 0.\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c8M (x) = \u03c0 \u22121/4 e\u2212x\nsatisfying\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ne\u2212x\n\n2 /2\n\n\u0010\n\n2 /2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1 \u2212 x2 ,\n\nAn important question thus naturally arises: how to find more even functions which also\nsatisfy (1), i.e. are there a series of even functions which can be considered as generalized\nMexican hat wavelets? To our knowledge, this question has not been posed and solved in\nthe literature before. In this letter we shall derive a general formula for finding Mexican hat\nwavelets by taking the advantage of Dirac's representation theory and the coherent state\ntheory in quantum optics, so that more mother wavelets and correspondingly more wavelettransformations can be introduced. Dirac's representation theory is not just a foundation of\n2\n\n\fquantum mechanics theory[4]; it has its own special features which allow it to be extended\nto new theoretical problems. In this Letter we shall show how this theory can help us to\ndirectly derive general formula for finding Mexican hat wavelets.\nAccording to Dirac's representation theory, we can express Eq. (3) as\nW\u03c8 f (\u03bc, s) = h\u03c8| U (\u03bc, s) |f i ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere h\u03c8| is the state vector corresponding to the given mother wavelet, |f i is the state to\nbe transformed, and\n+\n1 Z \u221e x\u2212s\nhx| dx \u2261 U (\u03bc, s)\n(7)\n\u221a\n\u03bc \u2212\u221e \u03bc\nis the squeezing-translating operator[5, 6], |xi is the coordinate eigen-vector of X, X |xi =\nx |xi, which in the Fock space is expressed as\n|xi = \u03c0\n\n\u22121/4\n\n\u221a\n1\na\u20202\nexp \u2212 x2 + 2xa\u2020 \u2212\n|0i,\n2\n2\n!\n\n(8)\ni\n\nh\n\nhere |0i is the vacuum state annihilated by the bosonic operator a, a|0i = 0, a, a\u2020 = 1,\n\u0011 \u221a\n\u0010\nand X = a + a\u2020 / 2. In order to combine wavelet transforms with transforms of quantum\nstates more tightly and clearly, using the technique of integration within an ordered product\n(IWOP)[5] (for a review see[6, 7]) of operators we can directly perform the integral in (7)\n1\nx2\n1+ 2\ndx : exp \u2212\n2\n\u03bc\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\nU (\u03bc, s) = \u221a\n\u03c0\u03bc\n=\n\ns\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n\u221e\n\n\uf8ee\n\n!\n\nxs \u221a x \u2212 s \u2020 \u221a\ns2\n+ 2+ 2\na + 2xa \u2212 2 \u2212 X 2 :\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n2\u03bc\n#\n\n!2\n\ns \u221a \u2020 \u221a\n+ 2a + 2\u03bca\n\u03bc\n\n2\u03bc\n1\n: exp \uf8f0\n2\n1+\u03bc\n2 (1 + \u03bc2 )\n\nwhere : : denotes normal ordering.

Now we want to find such |\u03c8i that obeys hp = 0| \u03c8i = 0.\nBy considering a\u2020n / n! |0i = |ni is the orthogonal basis of Fock representation, without loss\nof generality, we can expand |\u03c8i as\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n|\u03c8i = G a\u2020 |0i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\ngn a\u2020n |0i ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere gn are such chosen as to let |\u03c8i obey the condition (13). Then using the overcompleteness relation of coherent states (useful representation in quantum optics and can\ndescribe laser[11, 12]),\nZ 2\ndz\n|zi hz| = 1,\n(15)\n\u03c0\nwhere\n\u0010\n\u0011\n|zi = exp za\u2020 \u2212 z \u2217 a |0i ,\n(16)\na |zi = z |zi, and\n\nhp = 0| zi = \u03c0\n\n\u22121/4\n\nz \u22172\nexp\n,\n2\n!\n\n(17)\n\nwe have\nX\nd2 z\n|zi hz|\ngn a\u2020n |0i\n\u03c0\nn\n!m\nZ 2\nX\nd z \u2212|z|2 \u2217n X 1 z 2\n\u22121/4\ne\nz\n= \u03c0\ngn\n\u03c0\n2\nm m!\nn\nX (2n)!\nXX 1\ngn \u03b4n,2m n! = \u03c0 \u22121/4\ng = 0.\n= \u03c0 \u22121/4\nm\nn 2n\nn n!2\nm n m!2\n\nhp = 0| \u03c8i = hp = 0|\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n(18)\n\n\fThen condition (19) provides a general formalism to find the qualified wavelet. To illustrate\nthe usage of (19), assuming that in (19) g2n = 0 for n > 3, so the coefficients of the survived\nterms should satisfy\ng0 + g2 + 3g4 + 15g6 = 0,\n(19)\nand |\u03c8i becomes\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n|\u03c8i = g0 + g2 a\u20202 + g4 a\u20204 + g6 a\u20206 |0i .\n\n(20)\n\nProjecting it onto the coordinate representation, we get the qualified wavelets\n\u03c8 (x) = hx |\u03c8i\n\n= \u03c0 \u22121/4 e\u2212x\n\u0010\n\n2 /2\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+g6 8x6 \u2212 60x4 + 90x2 \u2212 15\nwhere we have used\n\n\u0010\n\ng0 + g2 2x2 \u2212 1 + g4 4x4 \u2212 12x2 + 3\n\u0011i\n\n,\n\n1\n2\nhx |ni = q\nHn (x) e\u2212x /2 ,\n\u221a\n2n n! \u03c0\n\n\u0011\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nand the Hermite polynomials' definition\n\nHn (x) = (\u22121)n ex\n\n2\n\ndn \u2212x2\ne .\ndxn\n\n(23)\n\nNow we take some examples and depict them in figures.\nCase 1: when we take g0 = 21 , g2 = \u2212 12 and g4 = g\u00106 = 0, \u0011we immediately obtain\nthe Mexican hat wavelet (see fig. 1) as in (4). Hence 21 1 \u2212 a\u20202 |0i is the state vector\ncorresponding to the Mexican hat mother wavelet.\nCase 2: when g0 = \u22121, g2 = \u22122, g4 = 1 and g6 = 0, we obtain (see fig. 2)\n\u03c82 (x) = 4\u03c0 \u22121/4 e\u2212x\n\n2 /2\n\nwhich also satisfies the condition\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n4\u03c0 \u22121/4 e\u2212x\n\n2 /2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nx4 \u2212 4x2 + 1 ,\n\n(24)\n\n\u0011\n\n(25)\n\nx4 \u2212 4x2 + 1 dx = 0.\n\nNote that when g0 = \u22122, g2 = \u22121, g4 = 1 and g6 = 0, we obtain a slightly different wavelet\n(see fig. 3). Therefore, as long as the parameters conforms to condition (19), we can adjust\ntheir values to control the shape of the wavelet.\nCase 3: when g0 = 1, g2 = 2, g4 = 4 and g6 = \u22121, we get (see fig. 4)\n\u03c83 (x) = \u03c0 \u22121/4 e\u2212x\n\n2 /2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22128x6 + 76x4 \u2212 134x2 + 26 ,\n5\n\n(26)\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n1\n2 x\n\n\u20134\n\n4\n\n\u20132\n\n2 x\n\n0\n\n0\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20134\n\nfig. 2:\n\nfig. 3:\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n2 x\n\n\u20135\n\u201310\n\u201315\n\nfig. 4:\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n\fand\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c0 \u22121/4 e\u2212x\n\n2 /2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22128x6 + 76x4 \u2212 134x2 + 26 dx = 0.\n\n(27)\n\nFrom these figures it is observed that the number of the crossing points of the curve at the\nx-axis is equal to the highest power of the wavelet function.\nIn summary, by converting wavelets and its admissibility condition into the framework\nof Dirac's ket-bra formalism and using the coherent state's well-behaved properties we have\nderived the general formula for composing Mexican hat wavelets, based on which more\nqualified wavelets can be found and more wavelet transformations can be defined. This work\nagain shows the powerfulness of Dirac's representation theory.\n\nReferences\n[1] Daubechies, I.
