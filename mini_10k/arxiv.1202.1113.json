Sun: chromosphere, Magnetic fields, Polarization\n\n1. Introduction\nThe magnetic field is commonly measured in the solar photosphere, while measurements of the chromospheric and coronal\nfield are rarer (see, e.g., Solanki et al. 2006, for an overview).\nWhereas photospheric magnetic field measurements dominantly\nemploy the Zeeman effect, in higher layers of the solar atmosphere other methods come increasingly into play (see Lagg\n2005, for a review), in particular also the Hanle effect. One of\nthe most used diagnostics of the magnetic field in the upper\nchromosphere is the 10830 \u00c5 He I multiplet. For this multiplet the Zeeman effect is sensitive to magnetic fields above \u2248 50\nGauss, well suited to study magnetic fields of active regions (e.g.\nHarvey & Hall 1971; R\u00fcedi et al. 1995; Penn & Kuhn 1995).\nThe Hanle effect is sensitive to weaker fields (1-100 Gauss) and\nhas been used to measure the magnetic fields of prominences\nand spicules observed off-limb (e.g. Trujillo Bueno et al. 2005;\nMerenda et al. 2006) and of filaments and emerging flux regions\nobserved on-disk (e.g. Trujillo Bueno et al. 2005; Lagg et al.\n2004). Unlike the level of polarization produced by the Zeeman\neffect, the polarization produced by scattering and then modified\nby the Hanle effect (in both 90\u25e6 and forward scattering) depends\non the anisotropy of the radiation field exciting the scattering\natoms.\nThis anisotropy increases with the height of the observed\nstructure above the solar surface (Sahal-Brechot et al. 1977).\nTherefore, this effect can in principle be used to determine\nat what height in the chromosphere or corona the observed\nmagnetic structures are located. Since the He I lines are optically thin in some locations, notably in the quite Sun (e.g.\nSend offprint requests to: L. Merenda\n\nGiovanelli & Hall 1977), but optically thick at others, in particular in young active regions (Xu et al. 2009), its formation could\nvary considerably, making such an independent determination of\nthe height an interesting addition to the diagnostic capabilities of\nthe He multiplet.\nSolanki et al. (2003) proposed an interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of an emerging flux region based\non the assumption that the He 10830 \u00c5 line is formed along the\nfreshly emerged magnetic field lines, which in this case reached\n\u2248 10 Mm. Recently, Judge (2009) has proposed a different interpretation of these observations according to which the magnetic\nfield sampled by the observations is located in a thin layer at a\nconstant height (\u2248 2.4 Mm) near the top of the chromosphere.\nThis controversy lends an even stronger need for an independent diagnostic of the height of the magnetic features sampled\nby the He I 10830 triplet. In this paper we develop the height\ndiagnostic further, first considering the influence of the height\non the strength of the Stokes Q and U profiles. Then, exploiting\nthe sensitivity of the Hanle effect to the height of the observed\nstructure, we have analyzed again the data of May 13 2003, in\norder to independently estimate the height to which these data\nrefer to, particularly at the location interpreted by Solanki et al.\n(2003) to be the apex of the highest reconstructed loop.\nIn Sect. 2 we summarize the data we analyze in this paper and introduce the codes we use to synthesize and invert the\nStokes profiles. In Sect. 3 we present results of a parameter study\nof the strength of the linear polarization signal. We also compare\nthe observed with the theoretical profiles in order to fix a minimum height and perform inversions with HeLIx+ , which allow\nthe field strength, direction and the height to be determined.\n1\n\n\fMerenda et al.: The Height of Chromospheric Loops\n\n2. Observational data and codes\n2.1. Data\n\nSpectropolarimetric maps of the emerging flux region NOAA\n9451 were recorded on 13 May 2001 using the Tenerife\nInfrared Polarimeter (TIP, Mart\u0131\u0301nez Pillet et al. 1999). The covered wavelength range contains the 10830 \u00c5 multiplet. The active region was located near disk center at \u03bc = cos\u0398 = 0.8. These\nobservations have been analyzed in several papers (Solanki et al.\n2003; Lagg et al. 2004, 2007) which emphasize different aspects\nof this rich data set. In the present paper we focus on one spatial\npixel of the observed map situated in the central part of the active\nregion (pixel x = 72, y = 43 of Fig. 1 in Lagg et al. 2004).\nThe Stokes profiles at this pixel are also displayed in Fig. 3\nof Lagg et al. (2004). This point is within the area of few pixels where the Hanle effect in forward scattering is most prominent in the Stokes profiles. Around this area the linear polarization rapidly falls below the noise level. This pixel also displays\nthe largest linear polarization signal in the entire map and, importantly, it corresponds to the apex of the highest loop reconstructed by Solanki et al. (2003). We refer to this pixel as the\nloop apex. It makes sense to concentrate on this loop-top pixel\nsince it displays the largest discrepancy between the interpretations of Solanki et al. (2003) and Judge (2009) and the large linear polarization alsomakes this pixel the best location to demonstrate the new technique.\nThe degree of linear polarization reaches 0.45% of the continuum intensity in the center of the red component of the multiplet (see Fig. 3 of Lagg et al. 2004). The observed polarization\nis approximately parallel to the dark lines visible in the core of\nthe red He I component which connect the footpoints of the reconstructed loop spanning the emerging flux region. These elongated absorption structures (see Fig. 1 of Solanki et al. 2003;\nLagg et al. 2004) are reminiscent of H\u03b1 arch filament systems.\nThe Stokes V signal in this region is comparable to the noise\nlevel of 10\u22123 of the continuum intensity. The surrounding pixels\nshow similar Stokes spectra with slightly lower linear polarization signal, but enhanced circular polarization signal.\n2.2. Synthesis code\n\nThe Hanle profiles observed on disk are produced by the presence of atomic polarization (i.e. population imbalances and\nquantum coherences between the magnetic sublevels pertaining\nto the upper and lower term of the 10830 \u00c5 multiplet; i.e. 3 P2,1,0\nand 3 S 1 respectively), generated proportionally to the degree of\nanisotropy of the unpolarized radiation field coming from the\nunderlying layers of the solar atmosphere. This atomic polarization, modified in the presence of a magnetic field by the Hanle\neffect in forward scattering (Trujillo Bueno et al. 2002), selectively absorbs and re-emits the unpolarized light coming from\nsolar disk center, acting as sinks and sources of linear polarization.\nTo reproduce these observed Hanle profiles we\nuse a synthesis code with the same forward calculation module as described in Landi Degl'Innocenti\n(1982),\nLandi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi\n(2004)\nand\nAsensio Ramos et al. (2008).\nThe Helium absorption is modeled to take place in a\nconstant-property slab located at a given height h above the solar\nsurface and illuminated from the underlying solar photosphere.\nIn this situation the degree of atomic polarization of the Helium\natoms is a function of (1) the anisotropic illumination that pro2\n\nduces this population imbalance, and (2) the presence of a magnetic field that modifies it. In a plane parallel atmosphere the\nanisotropy of the radiation at a given \u03bb depends basically on the\nheight of the scattering atom.\nIn order to quantify the atomic polarization we solve the\nstatistical equilibrium equations for the multipole components\n\u03c1KQ (J, J \u2032 ) of the atomic density matrix for a multi-term atom.\nWe take into account coherences between different J-levels\n(see chapter 7 in Landi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi 2004), the\nanisotropy of the radiation field for a given height (computed\nfor the center-to-limb variation tabulated in Pierce 2000) and\nthe presence of a magnetic field. Note that the sophistication\nwith which the polarization produced by the Hanle effect is\ncomputed here is considerably greater than in the analysis of\nSolanki et al. (2003). From the calculated density matrix elements it is possible to compute the emission coefficients (\u01ebI , \u01ebX\nwith X = Q, U, V) and the absorption coefficients (\u03b7I , \u03b7X ) for\npolarized light. To calculate the emergent Stokes parameters we\nuse the solution of the radiative equations for a slab of constant\nproperties (see, e.g., Asensio Ramos et al. 2008) taken to lie in\nthe upper chromosphere\n\u01ebI\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ),\n\u03b7I\n\u01ebI \u03b7 X\n\u01ebX\nX(\u03c4) = X0 e\u2212\u03c4 + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ) \u2212 2 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )\n\u03b7I\n\u03b7I\n\u0013\n\u03b7X \u2212\u03c4 \u0012 \u01ebI\n\u03c4e\n\u2212 Io ,\n+\n\u03b7I\n\u03b7I\nI(\u03c4) = I0 e\u2212\u03c4 +\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere I0 and X0 are the boundary conditions representing the\nradiation entering the slab from below. We take I0 to be the photospheric continuum at \u03bc = 0.8 as tabulated by Pierce (2000) and\nX0 = 0. This solution differs from the Milne-Eddington solution\nemployed in earlier analysis of the observed Stokes profiles considered here. The slab geometry has the advantage that it allows\na unique height to be assigned to the center of the absorption region. It may also be closer to the case of He I formation in an\nemerging flux region.\n2.3. Inversion code HeLIx+\n\nThe forward model described in the previous section is implemented in the inversion code HeLIx+ (Lagg et al. 2010). The\nfree parameters of the constant-property slab model are the\nmagnetic field strength, inclination and azimuth, B, \u03b3 and \u03c7\n(in the solar reference frame), the line of sight velocity, vLOS ,\nthe damping parameter a, the thermal broadening of the line,\nvDopp , the optical thickness of the slab, d, and the height of\nthe slab above the solar surface, h. Following the analysis of\nSolanki et al. (2003) we assume the filling factor to be unity.\nThe Pikaia genetic algorithm (Charbonneau 1995) was used to\nmaximize the fitness function f , defined as the reciprocal of\nthe squared difference between the measured and the observed\nStokes vector P (P = I, Q, U, or V) over a wavelength window\nof (\u22121.8,+0.9) \u00c5 centered at the red lines of the He IPtriplet, divided by the strength s of the observed profiles (sI = |I(\u03bb) \u2212 1|\n\u03bb\nP\nand sQ,U,V = |(Q, U, V)(\u03bb)|) and the number of free parameters\n\u03bb\n\nN f ree :\n\n1 X 1 X wP (\u03bb)\n[P f it (\u03bb) \u2212 Pobs (\u03bb)]2\n=\nf\nN\ns\nf\nree\nP\n\u03bb\nP\n\n(3)\n\n\fMerenda et al.: The Height of Chromospheric Loops\n\nThe weighting functions wP were chosen to be unity within\n\u00b10.6 \u00c5 around the core of the red component of the He I triplet,\nand was set to 0.6 outside this range. To take into account the\nreduction of the intensity level caused by the wings of the photospheric Si I at 10827 \u00c5 we fit this line with a Voigt function.\nThe parameters of this Voigt function are determined from an\naverage of 100 Stokes I profiles centered around the loop apex.\nIn extensive tests we found the Pikaia algorithm to be the\nmost reliable technique to determine the global minimum within\nthe considered parameter space independently of the choice of\nthe initial guess values. Additionally, the random walk convergence of the Pikaia algorithm allows for a comprehensive error\nanalysis in a statistical sense. The fluctuation of the retrieved\nparameters for individual, independent inversions of the same\nStokes vector naturally delivers a measure for the reliability and\nrobustness of the retrieved parameters.\n\n3. Results\nWe have performed computations with both codes introduced in\nSect. 2.2 and 2.3. These computations have different aims. In a\nfirst step, described in Sect. 3.1, we obtain an idea of the dependence of the linear polarization in the He I triplet on the components of the magnetic vector and the height of the slab. Then,\nin Sect. 3.2 we test whether this technique can be employed to\nset lower or upper limits on the height of the scattering atoms by\ncomparing with a given observed profile. Finally, in Sect. 3.3, we\nobtain a best estimate of the height of the sampled field using an\ninversion technique.\n3.1. Dependence of the computed polarization on height and\nmagnetic field\n\nThe way in which the presence of a magnetic field modifies the\nemitted polarization signal depends on its direction and on the\nposition of the observed point on the solar disk. For example,\noff-limb linear polarization emission is maximum in the absence\nof a magnetic field, or for a vertical magnetic field (with respect\nto the solar surface). Its value decreases for increasingly horizontal magnetic fields. For observations at solar disk center, on\nthe contrary, the He atoms do not emit linear polarization in the\nabsence of a magnetic field or for a vertical magnetic field. Here\nthe intensity of linearly polarized radiation increases for increasingly horizontal magnetic fields. For observations at other locations of the solar disk a behavior somewhere in between these\ntwo extremes is present. Figure 1 displays the results of an extensive parameter survey, which aims to determine the dependence of properties of the linear polarization on the parameters\nof the magnetic vector and the height of the slab. The computed\nexamples refer to \u03bc = 0.8, which corresponds to the location\nof NOAA 9451 at the time it was observed in He\n\u221a I. Each dot\nQ2 +U 2\n\nrepresents the degree of linear polarization p =\nplotted\nI\nversus the polarization angle \u03b1 = 0.5 tan\u22121 (U/Q) (both at the \u03bb\nof maximum p) for profiles computed for all possible orientations of the magnetic field. The inclination angle with respect to\nthe local solar vertical, \u03b8B , is varied from 0\u25e6 to 180\u25e6 in steps of\n2\u25e6 (\u03b8B = 0\u25e6 for a magnetic field vector pointing outward from\nthe Sun) and the azimuth angle in the plane parallel to the solar\nsurface, \u03c7B , is varied from \u221290\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 in steps of 4\u25e6 (\u03c7B = 0\u25e6 for\na magnetic field vector lying in the plane of the local solar vertical and the observer direction). At every distance above the solar\nsurface there is a maximum polarization, corresponding to \"vertical\" magnetic fields (less inclined than Van Vleck's angle 54.7\u25e6\n\nto the solar surface normal, red points in the figure). This maximum increases with height. The same increase occurs for the\n\"horizontal\" field (more inclined than Van Vleck's angle, black\npoints in the figure), although in this case the maximum reached\nis lower. Note that irrespective of the height there is no minimum\npolarization. This behavior implies that for a given measured linear polarization magnitude a lower limit on the height of scattering atoms can be placed, but no upper limit (just based on the\ndegree of linear polarization). Furthermore, this lower limit is\nhigher for a horizontal magnetic field than for a vertical field.\n3.2. Comparing observed with synthetic profiles for different\nheights\n\nIn Fig. 2 we compare the linear polarization profile of Fig. 3 of\nLagg et al. (2004), pixel x= 72, y= 43 in their Fig. 1, (points)\nwith the computed profile displaying the maximum linear polarization for a set of heights between 1 and 10 Mm above the solar surface. Each solid profile is plotted versus wavelength and\ncorresponds to the height given on the horizontal axis. Each synthetic profile is the one showing the largest U/Ic among all profiles in the \"horizontal\" range, i.e., more inclined to the vertical\nthan 54.7\u25e6, formed at that height (for both synthetic and observed\nprofile the reference direction for positive Stokes Q form an angle of 12\u25e6 with the nearest solar limb, resulting in Q/Ic \u2248 0).\nThe requirement that the magnetic field is in the \"horizontal\"\nrange is driven by the fact that the Stokes V signal is comparable\nto the noise level. Additionally, the Stokes V spectra along the\nloop structure change polarity close to the loop apex. It is also\nconsistent with the finding of Solanki et al. (2003) that this location corresponds to the top of a loop. Clearly, for heights lower\nthan 5 Mm the anisotropy of the radiation field that excites the\nHelium atoms is not able to produce sufficient atomic polarization to reproduce the observed U profile. In particular, a slab at\na constant height of 2.4 Mm, as proposed by Judge (2009), does\nnot provide a satisfactory description, since even the strongest\nU profile from that slab fails to achieve the polarization level of\nthe observed profile. It falls well short of the polarization in the\n5 most strongly polarized points of the observed profile.\n3.3. Results of inversions\n\nWe carried out a series of inversions (see Section 2.3 for a description of the code and setup) in order to determine the atmospheric parameters which best describe the observed Stokes\nprofiles shown in Fig. 3 of Lagg et al. (2004). The minimization technique used for the inversions with HeLIx+ involves the\ngenetic algorithm PIKAIA (Charbonneau 1995). This algorithm\nhas the advantage of finding the global minimum (i.e. the synthetic Stokes profile best matching the observed one) within the\nconsidered parameter space completely independent of any initial guess values. However, the path of convergence to this global\nminimum is random and may require an infinite number of iterations. To overcome this problem we repeated the inversions\n100 times, each with a sufficiently high number of iterations\n(n = 500). The result of the inversion run with the best fitness\nout of the 100 independent runs was considered to be the solution closest to the global minimum.\nThe allowed range for the values of the the atmospheric parameters for the individual inversion runs is presented in Tab.\n1. These ranges represent a carefully selected compromise between, on the one hand, stability and speed of the inversions and,\non the other hand, the full coverage of expected values for the\n3\n\n\fMerenda et al.: The Height of Chromospheric Loops\n\nFig. 1. Polarization diagrams computed for different heights above the solar surface (from 1 Mm\np in the leftmost frame to 9 Mm in the\nrightmost frame). In every diagram, the y-axis gives the degree of linear polarization p = Q2 + U 2 /I, the x-axis the polarization\nangle \u03b1 = 0.5 tan\u22121 (U/Q). p represents the maximum in the wavelength range covered by the He I multiplet. The plotted \u03b1 has\nbeen sampled at the same wavelength. Red points correspond to \"vertical\" magnetic fields (\u03b8B < 54.7\u25e6 or \u03b8B > 125.3\u25e6), while black\npoints correspond to \"horizontal\" magnetic fields (54.7\u25e6 < \u03b8B < 125.3\u25e6).\natmospheric parameters at the loop top. We carried out 100 independent inversion runs on the loop top pixel for each fixed He\nslab height ranging from 0.7 Mm to 17.5 Mm. The best fitness of\nthe 100 inversions at each height is plotted as a function of height\nin Fig. 3. The figure clearly shows that a global maximum of the\nfitness is achieved for a height of the He slab at the loop top\nof \u22486.3 Mm. Note that a higher fitness corresponds to a better\nfit. The smoothness of the maximum fitness curve in Fig. 3 indicates that even relatively small fitness differences are significant.\nThe fitness at the height of 2.4 Mm, proposed by Judge (2009) is\nmarked in Fig. 3 by a diamond. It is significantly lower than the\nbest fitness. Additionally we marked the fitness corresponding\nto height of 10.5 Mm as retrieved by Solanki et al. (2003).\nFig. 4 shows the fit obtained from the best inversion run for\na slab centered on a height of 6.3 Mm. Lower height values fail\nto produce a sufficiently strong linear polarization signal. If the\nabsorbing Helium slab is located higher than 6.3 Mm, the linear polarization signal resulting from scattering would be larger\nthan the observed one. The inversion procedure compensates\nthese strong signal by increasing the magnetic field strength,\nsince a stronger magnetic field leads to depolarization of the\nscattering polarization. However, with increasing magnetic field\n4\n\nstrength the Zeeman signal increases, resulting in a mismatch\nfor the Stokes V signal and consequently in a reduction of the\nfitness. The atmospheric parameters from the best inversion run\nare displayed in the fourth column of Tab. 1. The magnetic field\nstrength at the loop top is 311 G, the field is nearly parallel to the\nsolar surface (inclination angle \u03b3=95\u25e6 ), and the azimuth angle\nconfirms the orientation of the field along the visible structures in\nthe He equivalent width image in Fig. 1 of Solanki et al. (2003).\nThe up-flow of 1.3 km/s at the loop top confirms the rising flux\ntube scenario presented in that paper.\nThe simpler analysis of Solanki et al. (2003) provided a field\nstrength that dropped to around 50 G at the loop apex, while\nhere we obtain 320 G. The higher value lies considerably closer\nto the field strength that Wiegelmann et al. (2005) retrieved at\nthe apex of the loops closest to the one whose apex we study\nin this paper using a force-free extrapolation from the photospheric magnetic field map (305 - 615 G). This illustrates the\nimportance of using the more realistic treatment of the Hanle effect employed here compared to that employed by Solanki et al.\n(2003) and Lagg et al. (2004).\nWe also have inverted the few pixels showing linear polarization located near this one, finding comparable values of magnetic\n\n\fMerenda et al.: The Height of Chromospheric Loops\n\nFig. 2.

Discussion and conclusions\nWe have shown that an analysis of the linear polarization of the\nHe I 10830 \u00c5 triplet using an atomic polarization interpretation can be used to estimate the height at which the triplet is\n\nformed and hence the height at which it samples the local magnetic and velocity field. Lower limits on this height are more\nstraightforward to obtain than upper limits. Because the lower\nlimit is tighter for larger polarizations, this technique works best\nfor profiles displaying large-amplitude Hanle-like Q or U signals.\nSolanki et al. (2003) have proposed a reconstruction technique to obtain the 3D magnetic field structure of an emerging\nflux region observed near the disk center. This technique is based\non the assumption that the He 10830 \u00c5 line is formed along\nthe magnetic flux tube as it emerges through the chromosphere\ninto the corona. The reconstruction was constrained by requiring\nthe physical quantities in the loops to be smoothly varying and\nfor both footpoints of the loops to lie at the same height. They\nfound that the tallest reconstructed loop reached in its central\npart a height of \u2248 10 Mm over the solar surface. Recently Judge\n(2009) has proposed an alternative interpretation of this observation. He argues that the observed magnetic fields are located\nin a thin layer at a constant height (\u2248 2.4 Mm) at the top of the\nbasically plane-parallel chromosphere.\nIn the present paper we have analyzed the most critical pixel\nin the observation of Solanki et al. (2003), namely that at the\n5\n\n\fMerenda et al.: The Height of Chromospheric Loops\n26000\n\nI\n\n22000\n\n28.0\n\n20000\n18000\n16000\n\n27.5\n\n14000\n0.004\n\n27.0\n\n0.002\nU/IC\n\nBest Fitness of 100 HeLIx+ inversions\n\n24000\n\n28.5\n\n26.5\n26.0\n\n0.000\n\u22120.002\n\u22120.004\n\u22120.006\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nHeight [Mm]\n\n15\n0.002\n\nV/IC\n\n0.001\n\nFig. 3.

We found\nthe best inversion fit for an height of \u2248 6.3 Mm. This value\nis lower that the value found by Solanki et al. (2003), but the\ninversions favor the interpretation of the 3D loop reconstruction of Solanki et al. (2003) over the interpretation proposed by\nJudge (2009) because the fitness of the results (a measure of the\ngoodness of the fit) displays an asymmetric behavior, dropping\nrapidly towards lower heights, but comparatively gently towards\ngreater heights.\nFurther support for the above conclusion is provided by an\ninversion using HeLIx+ of a profile at the apex of emerging\nloops in AR NOAA 10917 presented by Xu et al. (2009). For\nthat active region the inversion including atomic polarization\nreturns a height of 7.1\u00b12\u2032\u2032 (5.0 \u00b1 1.4 Mm), which is not only\nhigher than the formation height of 2.4 Mm favored by Judge\n(2009), but also higher than the reconstructed looptops at 4 Mm.\nConsequently, there is some discrepancy between the heights obtained from magnetic field reconstructions and from the Hanle\neffect, but in the two cases studied so far the difference has opposite sign, which suggest that it is due to statistical errors. From\nthe present analysis we cannot judge if the error is larger in\nthe heights of the reconstructed loops or in the heights deduced\nfrom the Hanle effect. In both studied cases, however, the height\ndeduced from the Hanle effect is higher than that proposed by\nJudge (2009).\nThe interpretation put forward by Judge (2009) is probably\nvalid in the quiet Sun, where under \"normal conditions\" the He\nI 10830 \u00c5 multiplet tends to form in a thin layer at the top of\nthe chromosphere. As Judge himself pointed out, the He triplet\nis formed over \"a broad distribution of heights owing to the corrugated nature of the chromosphere\". An example of a structure in which He I 10830 forms well above its quiet Sun formation level are filaments or prominences. Thus, in prominences\nHe 10830 \u00c5 has been observed up to several tens of Mm above\nthe limb. The reason is the much higher density of material at\nchromospheric temperatures inside prominences and filaments\nthan in the surrounding corona. The density is sufficient to make\n6\n\n10828\n10830\nWavelength [\u00c5]\n\n10832\n\nFig. 4. The observed Stokes profile analyzed in this paper (solid\nblack curves; left vertical scale; same reference direction as Fig.\n2). The horizontal dashed line in the top panel corresponds to\nthe adopted continuum level. Also plotted (red solid lines) are\nbest fit profiles for a height of 6.3 Mm, obtained for a magnetic\nfield of 320 G, with an inclination of 95\u25e6 with respect to the local\nsolar vertical, and an azimuth of \u221286\u25e6 (see Section 3.3).\nthe line optically thick. Our result suggests that the line forms\nat much greater heights than usual in an EFR, just as it does in\nfilaments. Young, recently emerged loops in EFR, are often referred to as arch filament systems (AFS) when observed in H\u03b1\n(see, e.g., the review by Chou 1993) due to their arch-like shape\nand their high density of chromospheric material, which leads\nto enhanced absorption, giving them a filament-like appearance.\nThe He triplet similarly displays enhanced absorption in both\nEFRs studied to date, displaying dark filaments that look very\nsimilar to the ones seen in H\u03b1 (Xu et al. 2009). These dark filaments lie parallel to the magnetic field azimuth and are the locations at which loops can be reconstructed. They do not show\ninterruptions or inhomogeneities along their long axes as one\nwould expect in the interpretation favoured by Judge, but rather a\nsmooth change in brightness. The chromospheric magnetic field\nchanges equally smoothly along these filaments, in stark contrast to the photospheric field, which displays a very much higher\nlevel of inhomogeneity, including the presence of opposite polarities below the loop tops (see Fig. 1 of Solanki et al., 2003;\nFig. 5 of Xu et al., 2009). Thus, the magnetic field structure in\nan EFR is rather different from the simple potential field model\nused by Judge (2009), in which the photospheric and chromospheric fields are basically identical. These points also favor the\ninterpretation of Solanki et al. (2003) and lend support to the reconstructed loops.\nFinally, in his paper Judge (2009) did not put any emphasis on the fact that the 3-D structure of the reconstructed loops\nagrees rather well with a non-linear force-free (NLFF) extrapolation starting from a map of the photospheric vector mag-\n\n\fMerenda et al.: The Height of Chromospheric Loops\n\nnetic field. This was derived from an independent inversion of\nsimultaneously recorded spectropolarimetric measurements of\nthe photospheric Si I 10827 \u00c5 line. Since NLFF extrapolations\nhave no free parameter and take into account electric currents,\nthis agreement is quite remarkable. Interestingly the work of\nWiegelmann et al. (2005) also showed that a potential field is\na very poor representation of the chromospheric field, giving a\ncompletely different azimuth. Hence, even if ignoring the problem that photospheric magnetic structure is far more complex\nthan the chromospheric one, it is unclear if conclusions based on\na (extremely simple) potential field computation (Judge 2009)\nhave any validity for AR 9451.\nIn summary, a state-of-art treatment of the Hanle effect suggests that the interpretation of Solanki et al. (2003) is to be preferred over that of Judge (2009). More importantly, this paper has demonstrated the value of treating the Hanle effect\nmore completely than the simple approximation employed by\nSolanki et al. (2003). This more complete treatment leads not\nonly to the possibility of estimating the height of formation of\nthe He triplet, but also results in improved retrieved values of\nthe magnetic vector. The effect of the height on the line profiles\nis rather small, however, and thus requires observations with extremely low noise levels.\n\nWiegelmann, T., Lagg, A., Solanki, S.
