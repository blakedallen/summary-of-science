In fact, recent experiments have\nshown that graphene exhibits one of the highest phononic\nthermal conductivities of all measured materials[3]. However at low temperatures, the thermodynamic and thermal transport properties are much less well explored[4]\nand somewhat surprisingly, due to the single atomic\nthickness, low electron density, linear band structure,\nand weak electron-phonon coupling, the electron gas of\ngraphene is expected to exhibit extreme thermal isolation\n[5\u20137].\nThe very weak thermal coupling combined with exceptionally small electronic heat capacity of graphene\nleads to projections for very high sensitivity as both a\nbolometer[8, 9] and as a calorimeter [10, 11]. As is typical with extremely sensitive sensors, device readout with\nboth the sensitivity and sufficiently low measurement\nback-action to realize the ultimate measurement sensitivity can also be a significant challenge. Due to the\nthermal sensitivity and the relatively weak dependence\nof resistance on temperature[12, 13], the simplistic use of\nelectrical transport as the read-out scheme cannot realize\nthe ultimate sensitivity of graphene given by thermodynamic fluctuations[14, 15]. Here we present a measurement scheme based upon high frequency Johnson noise\nwhich provides both wide bandwidth and sensitivity to\nresolve the fundamental thermal fluctuations, with minimal disturbance to the thermal properties of the sample.\nThis technique should be useful for both thermodynamic\nstudies of graphene[16\u201319] and for very low temperature\n\nbolometric applications.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We first present\nthe thermal model of the electron gas of graphene at low\ntemperatures. We discuss the Johnson noise measurement scheme and fundamental limits to the sensitivity.\nWe then present our measurements which provide a direct and accurate measurement of the electron-phonon\ncoupling of graphene from 2-30K. We present a measurement of the thermal time constant and determine\nthe heat capacity of graphene. Finally, we explore the\nexpected sensitivity of graphene as a bolometer and as\na calorimeter in the temperature range from 10 mK to\n10 K. These estimates suggest a number of exciting possibilities: detection of single microwave frequency photons,\nphoton number resolution, and spectroscopy of terrahertz\nphotons[9, 20\u201322].\n\nTHERMAL MODEL\n\nFigure 1b shows the temperature dependence of the\nexpected thermal conductance channels for the twodimensional electron gas: coupling to the electrical leads\nthrough electron diffusion, GWF , coupling to the lattice,\nGep , and coupling to the electro-magnetic environment,\nGrad , where Gtot the sum of all three mechanisms.\nThermal transport through electron diffusion in\ngraphene has not yet been measured and most theories\nfocus on the clean, low density graphene[16, 17]. For\ndoped samples dominated by the disorder potential of\nthe SiO2 substrate[23] such as the sample in this report,\nwe assume the simple Wiedemann-Franz relationship as\na starting point. GWF = 12L0 Te /R, where L0 and R are\nthe Lorenz constant and the electrical resistance of the\nsheet, respectively. The pre-factor, 12, is the result of the\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1. A shows the measurement circuit: graphene, impedance matched with 1.161 GHz resonant, lithographic LC network\n(NbTiN film, Tc = 13.5 K), and connected to HEMT amplifier. B shows the expected thermal conductances (GWF , Gep , Grad )\nand heat capacity versus temperature for assuming a bandwidth of 80 MHz, n = 1011 cm\u22122 , and A = 10\u221210 m2 . The inset\nshows an optical micrograph of the graphene sample. Scale bar is 15 \u03bcm long. C shows the two-terminal resistance of the\ngraphene vs gate voltage, taken from 1.65-12 K. D shows the reflected microwave response versus gate voltage. The absorption\ndip at 1.161 GHz shows that the graphene is well matched to 50 \u03a9 in a 80 MHz band. E shows spectra of the measured\nnoise power taken at various sample temperatures, demonstrating the Johnson noise signal of the graphene in the impedance\nmatching band.\n\ntemperature profile developed by uniform ohmic heating\nand the presense of the thermal boundary condition of\nthe contacts in a two terminal device (see comment [14]\nin Ref. [24] and the supporting material).\n\nand for both T > TBG and T < TBG with very high\ncharge density, n \u2265 1013 cm\u22122 [31]. These measurements\nare consistent with the expected form and magnitude of\nthe coupling.\n\nThe thermal conductance through the emission and\nabsorption of blackbody photons into the electromagnetic environment formed by the electrical measurement system is limited by the quantum of ther2\nTe /(6~) and the bandmal conductance[25], G0 = \u03c0kB\nwidth of the connection to the environment, B: Grad =\nG0 (2\u03c0~B/kB Te ), assuming B < kB Te /(2\u03c0~) which is the\nbandwidth of the black body radiation[26\u201328].\n\nThrough careful engineering of the sample geometry\nand the coupling to the electrical environment, it is possible to force the graphene to thermalize primarily through\nthe electron-phonon channel, minimizing Gtot (see supplementary information) and at very low temperatures,\nthis thermal conductance is expected to be extraordinarily weak[7] (Fig. 1). The thermal modeling of our\ngraphene sample shows the thermal conductance is expected to be dominated by Gep for temperatures larger\nthan 1 K, and by GW F for T < 1K, as shown in Fig.\n1b. Superconducting leads can be used to block transport through GWF [25] although care must be taken to\navoid processes such as multiple Andreev reflection and\nelectron-electron scattering that has been found to contribute to heat transport when using superconducting Al\nleads to contact graphene[33].\n\nThe electron gas can thermalize through the emission\nand absorption of acoustic phonons[29]. For temperatures below the Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen temperature[13, 30, 31]\n(TBG = 2c\u03c0 1/2 ~vF n1/2 /(vF kB ) = 33 K for n = 1011\ncm\u22122 ), heat transport between electrons and phonons\nin a doped sample in the clean limit (kp le \u001d 1 where\nkp and le are the phonon wave vector and electron\nmean free path respectively) is expected to follow Q\u0307 =\nA\u03a3(Te4 \u2212 Tp4 )[5\u20137, 32], where A is the sample area,\n4\n\u03a3 = (\u03c0 5/2 kB\nD2 n1/2 )/(15\u03c1~4 vF2 c3 ) is the coupling constant, D is the deformation potential, vF = 106 m/s is the\nFermi velocity, c = 20 km/s is the speed of sound, and n\nis the charge carrier density. When |Te \u2212Tp | \u001c Tp , Gep =\n4\u03a3AT 3 . The electron-phonon coupling has been inferred\nusing the temperature dependence of electrical transport\nfor T > TBG at a charge density of n = 1012 cm\u22122 [13]\n\nFurthermore, for the same reasons listed above which\nresult in weak thermal coupling, the heat capacity of\nthe electron gas is also expected to be minute. For\ndoped graphene, the heat capacity is expected to be\n2 1/2\nCe = (2\u03c0 3/2 kB\nn Te )/(3~vF )[7, 18]. For perfectly undoped graphene, the heat capacity is expected to follow a\nT 2 ln T temperature dependence[19]; this is not the situation for a disorder sample on SiO2 substrate. At 100 mK\n\n\f3\nand with n = 1011 cm\u22122 , one expects Ce = 2.3 * kB for a\n1\u03bcm x 1\u03bcm flake. This combined with the thermal conductance, one can estimate the thermal time constant:\n\u03c4 = Ce /Gtot . Assuming Gtot \u2248 Gep , one expects the\nmaximum thermal time constant to be \u03c4 = 10ps at 10K,\n1ns at 1K, and 10\u03bcs at 10mK. Due to the linear bands\nof graphene, and the correspondingly high Fermi temperature, the heat capacity of graphene can be 50 times\nlower than that of a heterostructure 2DEG, assuming\nn = 109 cm\u22122 .\n\nNOISE THERMOMETRY AND SAMPLE\nFABRICATION\n\nGiven the expected very weak coupling and high speed\nthermal response, we have implemented microwave frequency noise thermometry to explore these delicate and\nhigh bandwidth thermal properties, (Fig.1). Noise thermometry has shown itself to be an excellent and nearly\nnon-invasive probe of electron temperature for nanoscale\ndevices with very minimal back-action heating[11, 25,\n34]. Curiously, the dominant effect of this measurement\nscheme on the graphene sample is to provide a thermal\nconductance channel for cooling through emission of photons into the measurement channel, Grad . This radiative\nchannel will be present for any electrical readout scheme,\nhowever in bolometers which are sensed using electrical\ntransport, heating due to ohmic loss is the dominant perturbation for an optimized measurement[8, 10].\nThe analysis of hot electron bolometers with resistive readout and operated with electrothermal feedback\nshows\n\u221a the optimized energy resolution to be \u2206E \u223c\n(2/ \u03b1) * \u2206E\u221a\nth [10, 15, 22, 35], where \u03b1 = (T /R)dR/dT\nand \u2206Eth = 4Ce kB T is the energy resultion limited by\nthermodynamic fluctuations of the bolometer. At 2 K,\nwe measure \u03b1 ' 0.03, which will limit the sensitivity of\na resistively read-out graphene bolometer to a sensitivity\n12 * \u2206Eth . This situation becomes much worse at lower\ntemperatures with both T and dR/dT decrease. Our\nanalysis shows that an approach based upon noise thermometry is capable of approaching the thermodynamic\nlimit, which leads us to believe that noise thermometry\nis preferable for experiments at very low temperatures.\nOur graphene sample is fabricated using exfoliation\nonto a Si wafer coated with 285 nm of SiO; the single atomic layer thickness is confirmed using Raman\nspectroscopy[36]. The high resistivity wafer (1-10 \u03a9cm at 300K) is insulating at cryogenic temperature to\nminimize the stray capacitance between the electrodes\nand ground, which would otherwise capactively load our\nimpedance matching network.\nWe match the relatively high impedance of a\n15 \u03bcm \u00d7 6.8 \u03bcm flake of graphene, 30 k\u03a9 at the charge\nneutrality point (CNP), to a 50 \u03a9 measurement circuit\nusing a lithographic, superconducting NbTiN LC net-\n\nwork, which is placed a few millimeters from the graphene\nsample. The LC network (L ' 125 nH, C ' 115 aF) resonates at 1.161 GHz with a bandwidth of 80 MHz. As\nshown in Fig. 1d, absorption of microwave power is as\nhigh as 97% within the matched bandwidth.\nIn the same frequency band where we have engineered\nhigh absorption, the graphene is able to efficiently radiate\nJohnson noise, shown as the peak in the noise spectrums\nat 1.2GHz in Fig. 1e. Analyzing these thermal noise\nspectrums below 8K in the matched bandwidth shows\nthe expected linear dependence of the Johnson noise with\ntemperature (Fig. 2a). For T > 8K, the LC matching network begins to substantially shift its frequency as\nthe temperature approaches the superconducting transition temperature and kinetic inductance effects become\nsignificant[37, 38]. The temperature-axis intercept of Fig.\n2a determines our system noise temperature of TS ' 12\nK.\nThe sensitivity of our noise thermometry, \u03b4Te , follows the Dicke Radiometer formula[39]: \u03b4Te /(Te + TS ) =\n(Btm )\u22121/2 , where tm is the measurement time, and B\nis the measurement bandwidth. For B = 80 MHz, this\nleads\ndensity for electron temperature\n\u221a\np to a noise power\nof STe = 2mK/ Hz at a sample temperature of 2 K.\nFigure 2a inset shows the measured normalized standard\ndeviation of the noise temperature versus measurement\ntime, plotted for two measurement bandwidths (4 MHz\nand 80 MHz); the data follows the Dicke Radiometer\nformula. We have recently realized much lower system\nnoise temperatures (Ts <1K) with the implementation\nof a high bandwidth, nearly quantum-limited SQUID\namplifier[40].\nOhmic contact is made using evaporated Au/Ti leads.\nHowever, an advantage of very high frequency measurement is that high transparency contacts are not required\nsince capacitive coupling to a metal film deposited on\nthe graphene can also be utilized. A 100nm thick, Au\nelectrostatic gate is insulated from the graphene using a\n100 nm thick, over-exposed electron beam resist (polymethyl methacrylate) as a dielectric[41, 42] (area in blue\nin Fig. 1b inset). Fig. 1c shows the measured resistance of\nthe graphene device versus gate voltage with mobility of\napproximately 3500 cm2 /Vs at low temperature, corresponding to a mean free path of about 20 nm. The charge\ncarrier density at the CNP is approximately 2 \u00d7 1011\ncm\u22122 , which is estimated by the width of the resistance\nmaximum[12, 43].\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nWe measure the thermal conductance of the electron\ngas by simultaneously applying currents through the\ngraphene to produce ohmic heating, Q\u0307, while measuring\nthe electronic noise temperature. We have investigated\nthe heat transfer in several limits: (1) measuring the dif-\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2. A shows the integrated noise power vs refrigerator temperature, demonstrating the expected temperature dependence\nof the Johnson noise signal. The deviation at temperatures above 8K due to the temperature dependence of the NbTiN\ninductor. The inset shows the precision of the noise thermometry taken with two measurement bandwidths, 4 and 80 MHz, vs\nintegration time. A resolution of 100 ppm is achieved, in agreement with the Dicke Radiometer formula (shown as lines). B\nshows the results of the differential thermal conductance measurements. The inset show a time trace, taken at 4 K, of the small\nheating current at 17.6 Hz, and the resulting 12 mK temperature oscillations at 35.2 Hz detected with the noise thermometer.\nThe red curve is a power law fit with exponent 2.7 \u00b1 0.3. C shows the results of applying large dc heating currents at various\nsample temperatures, Tp (points.) The expected form is shown as the blue line. Also shown, is the heating of the electron gas\nvs applied microwave power at 1.161 GHz, also showing a similar heating curve and demonstrating the microwave bolometric\neffect with graphene.\n\nferential thermal conductance with small quasi-static Q\u0307\nat various temperatures, (2) using larger dc current bias\nwhich produce temperature changes comparable or larger\nthan the starting sample temperature, (3) and with microwave frequency heating currents. All of these measurements show similar results and are consistent with\nthe existing theory of the electron-phonon coupling[5\u2013\n7, 32].\nFirstly, we impose a small oscillating current bias at\n17.6 Hz, detect the resulting 35.2 Hz temperature oscillations of the electron gas in the limit where \u2206Te /Te '\n10\u22122 , and then compute the differential thermal conductance: G = Q\u0307/\u2206Te (Fig. 2b). This data is well fit with\nthe expected form: G = (p + 1)\u03a3AT p , with \u03a3 and p\nas fitting parameters, with values 0.07 W/(m2 K 3 ) and\n2.7\u00b10.3 respectively. The power law exponent is near the\ntheoretical expectation of p = 3. Figure 2c also shows the\nresults of applying a wide range of DC current biases such\nthat Te can be much larger than Tp . We find this data\nto fit the expected form: Te = [Q\u0307/(A * \u03a3) + Tpp+1 ]1/(p+1)\nusing \u03a3 and p found from the differential measurements.\nWe also apply a heating signal at 1.161 GHz, at the\ncenter frequency of our LC matching network where the\nmicrowave power absorption into the graphene is nearly\ncomplete (Fig. 1d), and measure the increase in the\nelectron gas temperature with the Johnson noise. This\nmethod also shows the same thermal conductance as\nwe found with quasi-static heating and demonstrates\ngraphene as a bolometer to microwave frequency radi-\n\nation. Using the measured Johnson noise thermometry\nsensitivity and thermal conductance, the noise equivalent\npower (NEP) of\u221aour graphene bolometer in this work is\nabout 0.4 pW/ Hz at 2 K. Below we show that substantial improvements should be possible at lower temperatures and electron densities.\nTo probe the thermal time constant, \u03c4 , and reveal the\nheat capacity of the graphene, we utilize the microwave\nfrequency impedance matching network together with\nthe small temperature dependence of the electrical resistance of graphene (Fig. 1c). This is a modified 3-\u03c9\nmethod and is essentially a bolometric mixer[24].\nWe first apply a high frequency oscillating current,\nwithin the impedance matching band to heat the sam2\n2\nple: Q\u0307 = Iheat\n(t)*R(Te ) = Iheat\nR(Te )(1+cos(2\u03c9heat t))/2\nwhere \u03c9heat = 2\u03c0 * 1.161 GHz. Similar to the above thermal conductance measurements, the DC component of\nthe temperature change is observed through the Johnson noise of the sample. If the thermal time constant of the graphene electron gas satisfies 2\u03c9heat \u03c4 < 1,\nthen the temperature of the sample will oscillates at\n2 * \u03c9heat = 2\u03c0 * 2.322 GHz. From our measurement\nof the Gep and our expectation of the heat capacity\n, we expect 2\u03c9heat \u03c4 = 1 for T ' 5.7 K. Given the\nweak dependence of the sample resistance on temperature, dR/dT \u223c 400\u03a9/K at 2 K, the impedance, Z(\u03c9),\nwill also oscillate at 2\u03c9heat with Te . By applying a\nsecond smaller modulation tone across the drain-source\nof the graphene sample at \u03c9mod = \u03c9heat \u2212 1 kHz, the\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3. A shows the spectrum, refered to the input of the\nHEMT, due to bolometric mixing. The central, 600 pV red\ntone is due to a heating signal at \u03c9heat /2\u03c0 = 1.161 GHz,\nwhich produces a temperature response at 2.322 GHz, which\nis then mixed down to \u03c9bolo = \u03c9heat + 2\u03c0 * 1 kHz using a\nsmall modulation tone at \u03c9mod = \u03c9heat \u2212 2\u03c0 * 1 kHz. The\nblue spike, shifted down by 100 Hz, is the result of increasing\nthe modulation tone by 100 Hz. The green spike, shifted up\nby 200 Hz, is due to increasing the heating tone by 100 Hz,\nvalidating the expected relationship: \u03c9bolo = 2\u03c9heat \u2212 \u03c9mod .\nB shows a plot of the measured bolometric mixing tone normalized by our expected signal assuming the graphene thermal time constant \u03c4 = 0. The red points are measured with\na heating tone of \u03c9heat /2\u03c0 = 1.161 GHz, and blue points\nwith \u03c9heat /2\u03c0 = 17.6 Hz, both with a modulation tone of\n1.161 GHz-1 kHz. The dashed line shows he expected rolloff\nof the bolometric signal when 2\u03c9heat /2\u03c0 = 2.32 GHz and\n\u03c4 = Ce /Gep .\n\nimpedance oscillations are then transduced into a very\nsmall voltage oscillation, typically 10-100 pV, and are\nmixed back into the range of our matching network:\n\u03b4V (t) = (Imod e\u2212i\u03c9mod t ) * (\u03b4Ze\u2212i2\u03c9heat t ), where a component of \u03b4V (t) oscillates at 2\u03c9heat \u2212 \u03c9mod . Fig. 3a shows\nthe mixing tone depends on the input frequencies as expected. See supplementary information for more details\nof the mixing and signal processing.\nFor temperatures above 5 K we observe this mixed\ntone, resulting from bolometric mixing, with its amplitude agreeing with our expectations, demonstrating the\ntemperature oscillations of the graphene sheet at 2.322\nGHz. However, for temperatures below 5 K we observe a\nsubstantial decrease in the amplitude of the mixed tone,\nconsistent with the expected roll-off due to the finite ther-\n\nFIG. 4.

As a control of the experiment, we performed\nthe same measurement procedures with \u03c9heat set to 2\u03c0\u00d7\n17.6 Hz, and \u03c9mod = 2\u03c0 * 1.160999 GHz. No roll-off of\nthe bolometric mixed tone at \u03c9mod + 2 * 2\u03c0 * 17.6Hz versus temperature was observed which is as expected since\n2\u03c9heat \u03c4th \u001c 1 in this case. At 5.25 K, we calculate a heat\ncapacity of 12,000 kB which is comparable to the smallest\nheat capacity measured to date[9]. We also believe this\nto be the first measurement of a two dimensional electron\ngas at zero field.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe compare our thermal conductance data to the existing theoretical predications of the electron phonon coupling [5\u20137]. Using 30 eV as the deformation potential\nfrom the electrical transport measurements in single layer\ngraphene[12, 13, 31], we find our data consistent with\nan effective charge carrier density of 4.9 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 .\nThis is within a factor of 2.5 of the charge density estimated from resistance versus gate voltage measurements\n(2 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 ). The agreement of our data to the theory, both in magnitude and temperature dependence, is\nsomewhat surprising. Firstly, we make our measurements\n\n\f6\nat the CNP where the electron density is a result of a\nlarge disorder potential typical with SiO2 substrates[23].\nFurthermore, our sample is deep in diffusive limit, i.e.\nkp le \u001c 1. It is known from works in conventional twodimensional electron gas structures that this diffusive\nlimit and screening can substantially alter the electronphonon coupling[44]. To date, we aware of no published\nliterature on the electron-phonon coupling in graphene in\nthe diffusive limit and near the CNP. Theoretical work\nin this limit will be very useful.\nThe Wiedemann-Franz thermal conductance estimated here is based on that of a two-dimensional electron gas[16]. At low charge carrier density, theories have\nsuggested deviations from the WF relationship due to\nthe relativistic band structure[17]. This physics can be\nprobed by performing this experiment at lower temperature.\nThe data we have gathered on the thermal transport\nand thermodynamic properties of graphene from 2-30 K\nand the sensitivity of our wide bandwidth thermometry system motivates an estimation of the sensitivity of\ngraphene as a bolometer and photon detector at lower\ntemperatures[8, 10]. Figure 4 shows the expected sensitivity as a bolometer versus noise bandwidth for various\ntemperatures, where the noise\n\u221a equivalent power (NEP)\nis given by: N EP = Gtot * ST , where ST is the noise\nspectral density of noise thermometer. Given the minute\nheat capacity for T < 1K, the temperature resolution is\nexpected to be limited by the thermodynamic fluctuations of the energy of the electron gas [8, 45]: h\u2206Te2 i =\nkB Te2 /C, which gives ST (\u03c9) = 4\u03c4 kB Te2 /(C(1 + (\u03c4 \u03c9)2 ))\n. The maximum sensitivity versus measurement bandwidth is result of the balance between gaining resolution in the noise thermometry by increasing the measurement band, and increasing the thermal response by\ndecreasing Grad . As is clear from Fig. 4a and 4b, a\ngraphene-based bolometer may exceed the sensitivity of\nthe current state of the art bolometers developed for farinfrared/submillimeter\n\u221a wave astronomy with a sensitivity of 6 * 10\u221220 W/ Hz and a thermal time constant of\n\u03c4 = 300 ms [20], an improvement in bandwidth of \u223c5\norders of magnitude.\nAs a photon detector and calorimeter, the expected\n\u221a\nenergy resolution is given by[10, 11]: \u2206E = N EP * \u03c4 .\nGiven the exceptionally fast thermal time constant, one\nexpects single photon sensitivity to gigahertz photons\n(Fig. 4c). For astrophysical applications in terahertz\nspectroscopy, one expects an energy resolution of one\npart in 1000 at 300 mK for an absorbed 1 THz photon. This satisfies the instrument resolution requirements\nfor future NASA missions (BLISS) at 3He-refrigerator\ntemperatures[46]. Compare to the recently proposed superconducting hot-electron photon counter for THz application at 300 mK[21], the NEP of graphene-based\nbolometers is about 10 times less sensitive. However, the\nenergy resolution for graphene is expected to be about\n\n7 times better. In this way graphene bolometers are a\npossible solution for low photon flux photon counting in\nTHz regime[21]. At 10mK, the intriguing possibility to\nobserve single 800 MHz photons appears possible.\nFurthermore, for high rates of photon flux, \u1e45, the quantization of the field produces shot noise on the incoming\npower: Sshot = 2(~\u03c9)2 \u1e45 W 2 /Hz. For sufficiently high\nrates of microwave photons, this noise will dominate the\ntemperature fluctuations of the sample (Fig. 4d). At\n100 mK, and with 10 GHz photons, for fluxes greater\nthan 106 photons/s the noise of the bolometer should be\ndominated by the shot noise of the microwave field. In\nthis way, graphene would act as a photodetector for microwaves: square law response, absorptive, and sensitive\nto the shot noise of the incoming field. We know of no\nother microwave detector which has these characteristics\nand would open the door to novel quantum optics experiments with microwave photons[47].\nNote: During the writing of this work, we have become\naware to three other experimental works which touch on\nsome of these concepts [48].\nWe acknowledge help with microfabricated LC resonators from M.
