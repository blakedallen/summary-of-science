In the now-classic 1982 paper [3] of Harvey and Lawson, an m-dimensional submanifold L \u2282 Cm is defined to be special\nLagrangian if it is Lagrangian with respect to the standard K\u00e4hler form\n\u0001\ni\n(1.1)\n\u03c9 = dz1 \u2227 dz1 + * * * + dzm \u2227 dzm\n2\nand, moreover, the standard holomorphic volume form dz = dz1 \u2227 * * * dzm pulls back\nto L to be a real n-form, i.e., \u03a5 = Im(dz) pulls back to L to be identically zero.1\nIn other words, an m-dimensional submanifold L \u2282 Cm is special Lagrangian if\nand only if it is an integral manifold of the ideal I generated by the differential\nforms \u03c9 and \u03a5.\nAs Harvey and Lawson show, an L \u2282 Cm is special Lagrangian if and only\nif it is calibrated by the m-form \u03a6 = Re(dz). In particular, special Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds are mass-minimizing.\nIn the intervening 20 years, special Lagrangian submanifolds and foliations whose\nleaves are special Lagrangian submanifolds (and their generalizations to Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds in the place of Cm ) have turned out to be important in several areas in\ndifferential geometry and theoretical physics. The interested reader can consult\nrecent papers of Joyce, such as [4] for a survey and references to the (by now rather\nlarge) literature on this subject.\n1.2. Symmetry reduction. Because understanding the possible types of singularities of special Lagrangian submanifolds is important for applications, considerable\neffort has been expended to construct explicit examples.\nOne of the standard methods of constructing explicit integral manifolds of an\nideal I is to use symmetry reduction, i.e., to fix a subgroup G of the symmetries of\nthe given ideal I and look for solutions that are invariant under the action of G.\n1.2.1. Symmetries of I. In the case of special Lagrangian geometry, the symmetry\ngroup of the ideal I depends to some extent on the dimension m.\nThe dimension m = 2 is exceptional. In this case, there exists a complex structure J on C2 (different from the standard one) such that \u03c9 and \u03a5 are the real and\nimaginary parts, respectively, of a J-holomorphic (2, 0)-form on C. Thus, the local\nsymmetries of I are simply the local biholomorphisms of (C2 , J). (Moreover, the\nspecial Lagrangian submanifolds are simply the J-complex curves in (C2 , J).)\nFor m > 2, the symmetry group of the ideal I is finite dimensional and consists\nof the group generated by the translations in Cm , the group SU(m) acting linearly\non Cm , the dilations by nonzero complex numbers \u03bb that satisfy \u03bbm \u2208 R, and\nconjugation.\n1In fact, Harvey and Lawson show that if L \u2282 Cm is Lagrangian and oriented, then the pullback\n\nof dz to L is of the form ei\u03c6 volL , for some function \u03c6 : L \u2192 S 1 , where volL is the n-form on L\nthat is the volume form of the induced metric on L. The 'phase factor' ei\u03c6 is a sort of complex\ndeterminant, so the equation ei\u03c6 = 1 can be thought of as setting a determinant equal to 1, hence\nthe modifier 'special'.\n\n\fSO(n)-INVARIANT SPECIAL LAGRANGIANS WITH FIXED LOCI\n\n3\n\n1.2.2. Cohomogeneity one examples. Harvey and Lawson themselves considered\nand solved the problem of describing the G-invariant special Lagrangian submanifolds of Cm when G \u2282 SU(m) is either SO(m) or Tm\u22121 , a maximal torus in SU(m).\nThe Lagrangian-isotropic orbits of these actions have dimension m\u22121, and so the\nstandard theory leads one to expect that, in these cases, the G-invariant special\nLagrangian manifolds will be found by solving a single ode.\nIndeed, this is precisely what Harvey and Lawson find. They show that, when G =\nSO(m), the sets\n(1.2)\n\nLc = {\u03b6 u u \u2208 S m\u22121 , \u03b6 \u2208 C, Im(\u03b6 n ) = c}\n\nfor c a real constant are SO(m)-invariant and special Lagrangian at smooth points.\nThe set L0 is the union of m special Lagrangian m-planes that are each individually SO(m)-invariant. When c 6= 0, the set Lc , which is smooth, is the disjoint\nunion of m connected components, each of which is diffeomorphic to R\u00d7 S m\u22121 with\neach 'end' asymptotic to a SO(m)-invariant special Lagrangian m-plane. Moreover,\nany smooth, connected SO(m)-invariant special Lagrangian submanifold of Cm is\nan open subset of one of these examples.\nIn the case of G = Tm\u22121 , the picture is slightly more complicated: The Tm\u22121 invariant special Lagrangian submanifolds are the simultaneous level sets of the\nfunctions f0 , . . . , fm\u22121 where\n\u0001\nf0 = Im z1 z2 * * * zm\n(1.3)\nfk = |zk |2 \u2212 |zm |2 ,\n1 \u2264 k < m.\nMany of these level sets are singular (some are analytically irreducible and some are\nnot) and they furnish interesting examples of the kinds of singularities that mass\nminimizing currents can display. (In fact, this is one of the reasons that Harvey\nand Lawson found them so interesting.)\n1.2.3. General compact group actions. It may clarify matters to consider special\nLagrangian symmetry reduction in the case of an arbitrary connected compact\nsubgroup G, that, without loss of generality, can be assumed to be a subgroup\nof SU(m).\nRecall that the Lie algebra su(m) of SU(m) is the vector space of m-by-m\nskew\u0001\nHermitian matrices and is endowed with\u0001 a positive definite Ad SU(m) -invariant\ninner product defined by ha, bi = \u2212 tr ab .\nLet g \u2282 su(m) denote the Lie algebra of G and write g = z \u2295 [g, g] where z \u2282 g\nis the center of g. Using the above inner product, g can be identified with its dual,\nso g\u2217 and g will be identified henceforth. Let \u03c0g : su(m) \u2192 g denote the orthogonal\nprojection onto g.\nThe linear action of G on Cm is \u03c9-Poisson, with momentum mapping \u03bc : Cm \u2192\ng = g\u2217 given by\n\u0001\n(1.4)\n\u03bc(z) = \u03c0g i z t z\u0304 .\nNote that a G-orbit G * z \u2282 Cm is \u03c9-isotropic if and only if \u03bc(z) lies in z.\n\n1.2.4. Smooth reduction. For a fixed \u03be \u2208 z, let \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 \u2282 \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be) \u2282 Cm denote the\nsubset that consists of \u03bc-clean points.2\n2For a smooth mapping f : X \u2192 Y between smooth manifolds, a point x \u2208 X is said to be f \u0001\nclean if the level set Z = f \u22121 f (x) \u2282 X is a smooth submanifold near x and Tx Z = ker f \u2032 (x).\n\n\f4\n\nR. BRYANT\n\nThe submanifold \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 is usually dense in \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be) and has dimension m+k for\nsome k \u2265 1. The G-orbits in \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 are \u03c9-isotropic and of dimension m\u2212k.\nThe symplectic quotient M\u03be\u2217 = G\\\u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 will, at most points, be a smooth\nsymplectic manifold of dimension 2k, with the canonical projection \u03c0\u03be : \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 \u2192\nM\u03be\u2217 being a smooth submersion and the induced symplectic form \u03c9\u03be on M\u03be\u2217 having\nthe property that \u03c0\u03be\u2217 (\u03c9\u03be ) is equal to the pullback of \u03c9 to \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 .\nThe reduced space M\u03be\u2217 inherits a metric g\u03be defined by the condition that \u03c0\u03be :\n\u22121\n\u03bc (\u03be)\u2217 \u2192 M\u03be\u2217 be a Riemannian submersion. The pair (g\u03be , \u03c9\u03be ) then define a K\u00e4hler\nstructure on M\u03be\u2217 .\nFor any \u03c9\u03be -Lagrangian submanifold L\u03be \u2282 M\u03be , its preimage \u03c0\u03be \u22121 (L\u03be ) \u2282 \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 \u2282\nm\nC is a G-invariant \u03c9-Lagrangian submanifold of Cm .\nMoreover, it is not difficult to show that there is a k-form \u03a5\u03be defined on M\u03be\u2217\n(only up to a sign if \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 is not orientable) with the property that \u03a5\u03be vanishes\nwhen pulled back to L\u03be if and only if \u03c0\u03be \u22121 (L\u03be ) is special Lagrangian. In fact, up to\nan orientation, \u03a5\u03be can be seen as the imaginary part of a (k, 0)-form on the K\u00e4hler\nmanifold M\u03be\u2217 .\nThus, away from the singularities of the various mappings, the problem of describing the G-invariant special Lagrangian submanifolds of Cm can be reduced to\na similar problem in lower dimensions.\nExample 1 (Cohomogeneity 1). For example, when k = 1 (as is true in the HarveyLawson examples), M\u03be\u2217 is a surface and \u03a5\u03be is a 1-form on M\u03be\u2217 . The problem of\ndescribing the G-invariant special Lagrangian submanifolds (away from singularities) is thus reduced to finding the integral curves of a 1-form on a surface.\nAs another example, to illustrate the method and because this will be used to\nconstruct a needed example later, consider the action of G = S 1 \u00d7 SO(p) \u00d7 SO(q)\non Cp+q acting on Cp+q via the action\n\u0001\n(1.5)\n(ei\u03b8 , A, B) * (z, w) = eqi\u03b8 Az, e\u2212pi\u03b8 Bw ,\nz \u2208 Cp , w \u2208 Cq .\nThe momentum mapping is\n(1.6)\n\n\u0001\n\u03bc(z, w) = i(q|z|2 \u2212 p|w|2 ), Im(z t z), Im(w t w) .\n\nTaking \u03be = (ic, 0, 0) for some constant c \u2208 R, (which is the only allowable choice\nunless p or q is 2) yields\n\b\n(1.7) \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be) = ( \u03b6 u, \u03b7 v ) u \u2208 S p\u22121 , v \u2208 S q\u22121 , \u03b6, \u03b7 \u2208 C, q|\u03b6|2 \u2212 p|\u03b7|2 = c .\n\u0001\nOne then finds that \u03a5\u03be = d Re(\u03b6 q \u03b7 p ) , so that \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be) is 'foliated' (some of the\n'leaves' may be singular) by the level sets of the function Re(\u03b6 q \u03b7 p ), which are special\nLagrangian.\nExample 2 (Cohomogeneity 2 and almost complex surfaces). The k = 2 case is\nsomewhat more interesting. In this case, assuming that \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 is orientable,3 it\nis not difficult to show that M\u03be\u2217 (which has real dimension 2k = 4), inherits a\nnatural almost complex structure J\u03be such that L\u03be \u2282 M\u03be\u2217 is a J\u03be -complex curve if\nand only if \u03c0\u03be \u22121 (L\u03be ) is special Lagrangian. (In fact, \u03c9\u03be and \u03a5\u03be in this case turn\nout to be essentially the real and imaginary parts of a (2, 0)-form with respect to\nthe almost complex structure J\u03be .) If \u03bc\u22121 (\u03be)\u2217 is not orientable, then by passing to\n3The nonorientable case does occur, as will be seen below.\n\n\fSO(n)-INVARIANT SPECIAL LAGRANGIANS WITH FIXED LOCI\n\n5\n\nits orientation double cover, one can define \u03a5\u03be and J\u03be as before, but on a covering\nspace of M\u03be\u2217 .\n1.2.5. Singularities in reduction. Thus, one understands, in a general way, how to\ndescribe the special Lagrangian submanifolds invariant under a compact Lie group,\nat least away from singular points of the quotient M\u03be = G\\\u03bc\u22121 (\u03be). However, in the\ncase of cohomogeneity greater than 1, as in the recent work of Dominic Joyce [4]\n(cf., especially, the series of papers [5, 6, 7]), the singular locus plays an important\nrole. The standard approach described above is not adequate to address existence\nand uniqueness questions in this situation.\nTo take a specific example, Joyce considers the case of G = SO(2) acting on C3 =\n1\nC \u2295 C2 (trivially on the first summand C1 and in the standard way on the second\nsummand C2 ).4\nJoyce showed that a nonsingular SO(2)-invariant special Lagrangian 3-fold L \u2282\nC3 meets the fixed factor C1 , if at all, in a nonsingular real-analytic arc A \u2282 C1 .\nNow, in fact, A lies in two distinct SO(2)-invariant, special Lagrangian 3-folds,\nnamely L and i\u22c6L, where i acts on C3 as i\u22c6(z0 , z1 , z2 ) = ( z0 , i z1 , i z2 ). (That i\u22c6L\nis special Lagrangian and distinct from L is left to the reader, but see \u00a72.3.1.)\nFor use in his work on singularities of special Lagrangian 3-folds, Joyce asked5\nwhether, any nonsingular SO(2)-invariant special Lagrangian 3-fold that meets C\nin the arc A \u2282 C1 is equal to one of L or i\u22c6L in some neighborhood of A.\n1.3. Results. As will be proved in this article, a stronger statement is true: For\nany nonsingular, connected, embedded, real-analytic arc A \u2282 C, there exist two distinct SO(2)-invariant, nonsingular, embedded, connected special Lagrangian submanifolds of C3 that intersect the fixed C1 in the analytic arc A. Moreover, any\nSO(2)-invariant, nonsingular, embedded, connected special Lagrangian submanifold of C3 that intersects the fixed C1 in the analytic arc A agrees with one of these\ntwo special Lagrangian submanifolds in some open neighborhood of A.\nMoreover, these existence and uniqueness results generalize when appropriately\nstated, when A is noncompact,6 to the case of SO(n) acting on Cn+1 = C1 \u2295\nCn (trivially on the first summand C1 and in the standard way on the second\nsummand Cn ). As this is no more difficult than the case n = 2 (which is the one\nof interest to Joyce), these more general results will be proved in this article, cf.\nTheorems 2 and 3.\nThe method used to establish this uniqueness result is basically an elementary,\nthough slightly delicate, examination of a power series expansion. However, the\nthis argument, while it proves uniqueness, only suffices to prove existence in the\ncategory of formal power series. It is not adequate to address the problem of\nexistence and the elementary argument does not seem to lend itself to any of the\nusual methods of proving convergence of the formal power series. However, it turns\nout that, by calling on the work of G\u00e9rard and Tahara on existence of solutions of\ncertain kinds of singular holomorphic pde, the convergence of this power series can\nbe established.\n4The SO(2)-action that Joyce actually considers is conjugate to this one in SU(3), but this\n\nobviously will not affect the results.\n5private communication, 2 January 2002.\n6When n > 2, the assumption of noncompactness is necessary, cf.

The group action. The group SO(n) will be taken to act on Cn+1 = C \u2295 Cn\nin the manner as described in the introduction, namely, trivially on the first Csummand and as the C-linear extension of its standard action on Rn in the remaining Cn .\n2.2.

Nonzero momentum in the case n = 2. When n > 2, the algebra so(n) has\ntrivial center, so, by the remarks in \u00a71.2.3, there is only need to consider \u03bc\u22121 (0),\nwhich is the case of most concern in this article.\nHowever, when n = 2, the algebra so(2) \u2243 R is abelian and the level sets of \u03bc\nare the hypersurfaces Hc of the form x1 y2 \u2212 y1 x2 = c, where c \u2208 R is any constant.\nWhen c 6= 0, the \u03bc-level set Hc \u2282 C3 is smooth and SO(2) \u2243 S 1 acts freely\non Mc . The reduced space Mc = SO(2)\\Hc is thus a smooth 4-manifold endowed\nwith a nonintegrable almost complex structure Jc such that the Jc -complex curves\nin Mc are the SO(2)-quotients of the SO(2)-invariant special Lagrangian 3-folds\nin C3 that lie in the level set Hc .\nEach of the (Mc , Jc ) with c 6= 0 is equivalent to (M1 , J1 ), so there is really only\none case of nonzero momentum that needs to be treated. In any case, since there are\nno singular SO(2)-orbits involved, these cases are reduced to the study of complex\ncurves in almost complex 4-manifolds and will not be discussed further here.\n\n\fSO(n)-INVARIANT SPECIAL LAGRANGIANS WITH FIXED LOCI\n\n7\n\n2.2.2. The zero momentum almost complex structure. Henceforth, to avoid having\nto continually mention trivial cases, it will be assumed that n > 1.\nThe locus \u03bc\u22121 (0) \u2282 Cn+1 is singular, with its singular locus consisting of the\nfixed points of the SO(n)-action, i.e., the points of the form (z0 , 0, . . . , 0). It can be\nparametrized via the mapping \u03a6 : C \u00d7 C \u00d7 S n\u22121 \u2192 \u03bc\u22121 (0) defined by\n(2.4)\n\n\u03a6(w, \u03b6, u) = (w, \u03b6 u1 , \u03b6 u2 , . . . , \u03b6un )\n\nwhere w, \u03b6 \u2208 C and u = (u1 , . . . , un ) \u2208 S n\u22121 . Note that \u03a6(w, \u03b6, u) = \u03a6(w, \u2212\u03b6, \u2212u),\nso that \u03a6 is a 2-to-1 diffeomorphism away from the locus \u03b6 = 0, which is mapped\nby \u03a6 onto the fixed locus of the SO(n)-action.\nComputation yields\n\u0001\n(2.5)\n\u03a6\u2217 (\u03c9) = 2i dw \u2227 dw\u0304 + d\u03b6 \u2227 d\u03b6\u0304\nand\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u03a6\u2217 (\u03a5) =\n\n1\nn Im\n\n\u0001\ndw \u2227 d(\u03b6 n ) \u2227 \u03a9\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the standard volume form on S n\u22121 , i.e.,\n(2.7)\n\n\u03a9 = u1 du2 \u2227 . . .\n\n\u2227 dun\n\n+ * * * + (\u22121)n\u22121 un du1 \u2227 . . .\n\n\u2227 dun\u22121 .\n\nIt follows that any SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian L \u2282 Cn+1 (of momentum\u0001\nzero in case n = 2) that does not meet the fixed locus is of the form L = \u03a6 \u03a3\u00d7S n\u22121\nfor some surface \u03a3 \u2282 C2 that does not meet the line \u03b6 = 0 and that is an integral\nmanifold of the two 2-forms\n\u0001\n\u03a81 = 2i dw \u2227 dw\u0304 + d\u03b6 \u2227 d\u03b6\u0304 ,\n\u0001\n(2.8)\n\u03a82 = Im dw \u2227 d(\u03b6 n ) .\n\nLet M0 \u2282 C2 denote the complement of the line \u03b6 = 0. Then \u03a81 and \u03a82 are linearly\nindependent on M0 .\nMoreover, on M0 , the 2-forms \u03a81 and \u03a82 are multiples of the real and imaginary\nparts of the decomposable complex-valued 2-form\n2\n(2.9)\n\u03a8 = \u03c91 \u2227 \u03c92 = \u2212\n\u03a82 + 2i \u03a81\nn|\u03b6|n\u22121\nwhere \u03c91 and \u03c92 are the 1-forms on M0 defined by the formulae\nn\u22121\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u03c91 = dw + i\n\n\u03b6\nd\u03b6\n,\nn\u22121\n|\u03b6|\n\n\u03c92 = dw + i\n\n\u03b6 n\u22121 d\u03b6\n.\n|\u03b6|n\u22121\n\nSince \u03c91 \u2227\u03c92 \u2227\u03c91 \u2227\u03c92 6= 0, it follows that there exists a unique almost complex structure J0 on M0 for which \u03c91 and \u03c92 furnish a basis of \u03a91,0 (M0 , J0 ).\nRemark 1 (Nonintegrability of J0 ). Although it will not be needed in the rest of\nthis article, the reader might like to know a bit more about the almost complex\nstructure J0 , so some information about it will be mentioned here.\nFirst, as is easily computed, J0 is not integrable. In fact, its Nijenhuis tensor is\nnowhere vanishing.\nSecond, the almost complex manifold (M0 , J0 ) is homogeneous: The diffeomorphisms Fa,b : M0 \u2192 M0 defined by\n!\nn\nb\nw + a, b \u03b6\n(2.11)\nFa,b (w, \u03b6) =\n|b|n\u22121\n\n\f8\n\nR. BRYANT\n\nfor constants a \u2208 C and b \u2208 C\u2217 preserve the almost complex structure J0 and it is\nclear that these mappings generate a group that acts simply transitively on M0 .\nIt is not difficult to show that the mappings Fa,b as defined in (2.11) together\nwith the involution A : M0 \u2192 M0 defined by\nA(w, \u03b6) = ( w, \u03b6 )\n\n(2.12)\n\ngenerate the group of automorphisms of (M0 , J0 ). In fact, a slightly stronger statement is true: Any local automorphism of (M0 , J0 ) defined on a connected open subset of M0 extends uniquely to a global automorphism and is either of the form Fa,b\nor A\u25e6Fa,b .\nThis last claim follows from the properties of the (1, 0)-forms\n(2.13)\n\n\u03b71 =\n\n|\u03b6|n\u22121\n\u03b6\n\nn\n\ndw + i\n\nd\u03b6\n,\n\u03b6\n\n\u03b72 =\n\n|\u03b6|n\u22121\nd\u03b6\ndw + i\n,\n\u03b6n\n\u03b6\n\nwhich are invariant under the action of Fa,b and are exchanged by A.\nInspection shows that the mapping C : M0 \u2192 M0 defined by\n(2.14)\n\nC(w, \u03b6) = (w, ei\u03c0/n \u03b6)\n\nis J0 -antilinear (since C \u2217 \u03c91 = \u03c92 and C \u2217 \u03c92 = \u03c91 ), a fact that will be useful below.\nThird, the almost complex structure J0 on M0 cannot be extended continuously\nacross the line \u03b6 = 0. However, in view of the fact that this line is the fixed locus\nof the 'conjugation' C, one can think of the line \u03b6 = 0 as a sort of 'singular' totally\nreal submanifold of (C2 , J0 ).\nRemark 2 (The double cover). The reader may have noticed that M0 is not the\nsymplectic quotient SO(n)\\\u03bc\u22121 (0)\u2217 but rather is a double cover of it. In fact,\nwhen n is odd, it is necessary to take this double cover since \u03bc\u22121 (0)\u2217 is not orientable when n is odd. Consequently, in this case, J0 is only defined up to a sign\non SO(n)\\\u03bc\u22121 (0)\u2217 .\nThere are other reasons for working on M0 . As will be seen below, a nonsingular\nSO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 Cn+1 that meets the fixed\nlocus will be represented by a smooth surface \u03a3 \u2282 M0 that extends across the\nline \u03b6 = 0 to a smoothly embedded surface in C2 that meets the line \u03b6 = 0 in a\nsmooth analytic arc.\n2.3. Invariant special Lagrangian planes. Suppose that a nonsingular SO(n)invariant special Lagrangian L \u2282 Cn+1 meets the fixed locus C of the SO(n)-action\nat a point z \u2208 L. Then the tangent plane Tz L must be a SO(n)-invariant special\nLagrangian (n+1)-plane.\nThere is a circle of such (n+1)-planes: For each \u03c8, there is the (n+1)-plane P\u03c8\ndefined by the linearly independent equations\n(2.15)\n\n0 = cos n\u03c8 dy0 + sin n\u03c8 dx0\n= cos \u03c8 dy1 \u2212 sin \u03c8 dx1 = * * * = cos \u03c8 dyn \u2212 sin \u03c8 dxn .\n\nOf course P\u03c8 = P\u03c8+\u03c0 , but the planes {P\u03c8 0 \u2264 \u03c8 < \u03c0} are pairwise distinct.\nNote that each P\u03c8 intersects C in a real 1-dimensional linear subspace; that,\nconversely, each (real) 1-dimensional linear subspace of C lies in exactly n of these\nSO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian (n+1)-planes; and that the projections of these\nn special Lagrangian (n+1)-planes into Cn are pairwise disjoint.\n\n\fSO(n)-INVARIANT SPECIAL LAGRANGIANS WITH FIXED LOCI\n\n9\n\n2.3.1. The \u03bb-action. Let \u03bb = e\u03c0i/n , so that \u03bb generates a multiplicative cyclic\nsubgroup of order 2n, denoted Z2n \u2282 S 1 \u2282 C.\nThe Z2n -action on Cn+1 defined by\n\u0001\n(2.16)\n\u03bbj \u22c6(z0 , , z1 , . . . , zn ) = z0 , \u03bbj z1 , . . . , \u03bbj zn\n\npulls back the holomorphic volume form dz to (\u22121)j dz and commutes with the SO(n)action. It follows that this action carries special Lagrangian (n+1)-planes to other\nspecial Lagrangian (n+1)-planes (but may reverse their orientations) and permutes\nthe n SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian (n+1)-planes that contain a given fixed\n(real) line in C.\nIn particular, if L \u2282 Cn+1 is special Lagrangian, then \u03bbj \u22c6L is also special Lagrangian for 0 \u2264 j < 2n and satisfies \u03bbj \u22c6L \u2229 C = L \u2229 C. Note that \u03bbj+n \u22c6L\nand \u03bbj \u22c6L are tangent along their common intersection with C. As will be seen\nbelow in Remark 3, these two special Lagrangian submanifolds are actually equal\nin a neighborhood of C.\n2.3.2. A commuting action. The SO(n)-action commutes with the group of special\nLagrangian symmetries of Cn+1 of the form\n\u0001\n(2.17)\n\u03a6a,\u03b8 (z0 , z1 , . . . , zn ) = eni\u03b8 z0 + a, e\u2212i\u03b8 z1 , . . . , e\u2212i\u03b8 zn , .\nwhere a \u2208 C and \u03b8 \u2208 R/(2\u03c0Z) are constants. Note that this group action (which\ndoes preserve the special Lagrangian calibration) acts transitively on the (n+1)planes of the form P\u03c8 . Also, this group action preserves the fixed locus C and acts\non C as the group of Euclidean isometries of C (regarded as a real 2-plane).\n\n2.4. The fixed locus. The goal of this subsection is to examine the geometry of\nan SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 Cn that meets the fixed\nlocus C \u2282 Cn+1 then apply the results to prove the following (which was proved by\nDominic Joyce in the case n = 2):\nProposition 1. Suppose that L \u2282 Cn+1 is an embedded nonsingular special Lagrangian submanifold that is SO(n)-invariant and that meets the fixed locus C.\nThen A = L \u2229 C is an embedded nonsingular real-analytic curve in C. If n > 2,\nthen A has no compact component.\nProof. Let L \u2282 Cn+1 be an embedded, nonsingular SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian submanifold that meets the fixed line C \u2282 Cn+1 at a point z \u2208 L \u2229 C.\nAfter applying an action of the form (2.17), it can be assumed that z = 0 and\nthat T0 L = P0 = Rn+1 .\nSince L is embedded and Lagrangian and since T0 L = Rn+1 , it follows that, in\nsome neighborhood of 0 \u2208 Cn+1 , the submanifold L can be parametrized in the\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n(x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ), . . . , xn + i\n(x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ),\n(2.18)\nx0 + i\n\u2202x0\n\u2202xn\n\nfor some function F that is defined on a neighborhood of 0 \u2208 Rn+1 and has all of\nits first and second partials vanishing there. The function F can be made unique\nby requiring that F (0, . . . , 0) = 0, so assume this.\nSince L is nonsingular and special Lagrangian (and hence minimal), the known\nregularity of minimal submanifolds [8] implies that L is real-analytic and hence\nthat F is real-analytic also.\n\n\f10\n\nR. BRYANT\n\nBecause F is invariant under the action of SO(n), there exists a real-analytic\nfunction \u03c6 defined in a neighborhood V \u2282 R2 of (0, 0) that is even in the second\nvariable (i.e., \u03c6(t, \u03c3) = \u03c6(t, \u2212\u03c3)) and that satisfies\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n(2.19)\nF (x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03c6 x0 , x1 2 + * * * +xn 2 .\n\nn+1\nfor (x0 , . . . , xn ) sufficiently near\n. (The reason for defining \u03c6\n\u221a the origin in R\nas an even function of \u03c3 = x1 2 + * * * +xn 2 rather than directly as a function\nof x1 2 + * * * +xn 2 is that it leads to a more manageable equation in the uniqueness\nanalysis to be done below.)\nBecause \u03c6 is even in its second argument, the quotient \u03c6\u03c3 (t, \u03c3)/\u03c3 is a realanalytic function (also even in \u03c3) on V \u2282 R. Thus, the graph of F can be\nparametrized analytically near 0 \u2208 Cn+1 in the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6\u03c3 (t, |x|)\n\u03c6\u03c3 (t, |x|)\n, . . . , xn + i xn\n(2.20)\nt + i \u03c6t (t, |x|), x1 + i x1\n|x|\n|x|\n\u221a\nwhere |x| = x1 2 + * * * +xn 2 . The condition that T0 L = Rn+1 is then equivalent\nto the conditions that \u03c6t (t, \u03c3) have vanishing differential at (t, \u03c3) = (0, 0) and that\nthe smooth function \u03c6\u03c3 (t, \u03c3)/\u03c3 vanish at (t, \u03c3) = (0, 0).\nAn immediate consequence of the representation (2.20) is that, in a neighborhood\nof the origin, L \u2229 C consists of the points of the form\n\n(2.21)\n\n( t + i \u03c6t (t, 0), 0, . . . , 0)\n\nfor |t| sufficiently small, which is a nonsingular real-analytic curve.\nSince z was an arbitrary point of L \u2229 C, it follows that L \u2229 C is a nonsingular\nembedded real-analytic curve A \u2282 C.\nFinally, suppose that A = L \u2229 C has a compact component, i.e., an embedded\nclosed curve A0 \u2282 A. Choose a periodic, nonsingular parametrization (x, y) : R \u2192\nA0 with period 1, i.e., x(t+1) = x(t) and y(t+1) = y(t). There will then exist a\nsmooth function \u03b8 : R \u2192 R such that\np\np\ny \u2032 (t) = \u2212 sin \u03b8(t) x\u2032 (t)2 + y \u2032 (t)2 .\n(2.22) x\u2032 (t) = cos \u03b8(t) x\u2032 (t)2 + y \u2032 (t)2 ,\nSince A0 is an embedded curve, it has rotation number \u00b11, i.e., \u03b8(t+1) = \u03b8(t) \u00b1 2\u03c0.\nBy reversing the orientation of the parametrization if necessary, it can be supposed\nthat \u03b8(t+1) = \u03b8(t) + 2\u03c0.\nNow, the\n\u0001 special Lagrangian planes that contain the tangent line to A at z =\nx(0), y(0) are, by construction, of the form P\u03b8(0)/n+k\u03c0/n for k = 0, 1, . . . , n\u22121,\nso one of these is Tz L. Fix k so that Tz L = P\u03b8(0)/n+k\u03c0/n . Then, by continuity, it\nfollows that\n(2.23)\n\nT\n\nx(t),y(t)\n\n\u0001 L = P\u03b8(t)/n+k\u03c0/n\n\nfor all t. However, since x and y are periodic of period 1, it would then follow that\n\u0001L = T\n\u0001L\nP\u03b8(0)/n+k\u03c0/n = T\nx(0),y(0)\nx(1),y(1)\n(2.24)\n= P\u03b8(1)/n+k\u03c0/n = P\u03b8(0)/n+2\u03c0/n+k\u03c0/n .\nHowever, if n were greater than 2, the first and last of the planes in this string of\nequalities could not be equal. Thus, n = 2, as claimed.\n\u0003\n\n\fSO(n)-INVARIANT SPECIAL LAGRANGIANS WITH FIXED LOCI\n\n11\n\nExample 3 (Extending the unit circle). The last statement of Proposition 1 may\nseem surprising at first. However, consider the case in which A is the unit circle\nin C \u2282 Cn+1 . Using the circle invariance to reduce the integration problem to an\node (as in Example 1), one finds that the locus\n\u0001\n\b\n(2.25)\nL = (z, \u03b6u) |\u03b6|2 = n |z|2 \u2212 1 , Re(z\u03b6 n ) = 0, u \u2208 S n\u22121 \u2282 Cn+1\n\nis smooth away from A = L \u2229 C and is special Lagrangian. Near each point of A,\nthe locus L is a union of n smooth distinct sheets intersecting pairwise in A.\nWhen n is odd, L \\ A is connected, so L is analytically irreducible. When n is\neven, L\\A has two connected components, and, in fact, L is the union of two distinct\nanalytically irreducible pieces: L+ , on which Im(z\u03b6 n ) is nonnegative, and L\u2212 , on\nwhich Im(z\u03b6 n ) is nonpositive. Near each point of A, each of L+ and L\u2212 is a union\nof 12 n smooth distinct sheets. Only when n = 2 are L+ and L\u2212 smooth.\nThis behavior for the unit circle is typical for embedded closed curves in general,\nas will be seen.\nRemark 3 (Invariance under \u03bbn ). The representation (2.20) also shows that F is\neven in the variables x1 , . . . , xn . In particular, this implies that, if L \u2282 Cn+1 is the\ngraph of F regarded as a special Lagrangian submanifold, then \u03bbn \u22c6L = L on some\nneighborhood of 0 \u2208 Cn+1 .\nBy analytic continuation, it follows that, for any embedded, non-singular, SO(n)invariant, connected special Lagrangian L \u2282 Cn+1 that meets C, the submanifolds \u03bbn \u22c6L and L are equal in some open neighborhood of L \u2229 C.\nRemark 4 (Image in M0 ). It is a consequence of the proof that there is a neighborhood U \u2282 Cn+1 of 0 such that U \u2229 L = \u03a6(\u03a3\u03c6 \u00d7 S n\u22121 ) where \u03a3\u03c6 \u2282 C2 is the\nanalytically embedded surface\n\b\n\u0001\n(2.26)\n\u03a3\u03c6 =\nt + i \u03c6t (t, \u03c3), \u03c3 + i \u03c6\u03c3 (t, \u03c3) (t, \u03c3) \u2208 V .\nNote that, when n is odd, the embedding \u03b9\u03c6 : V \u2192 C2 defined by\n\u0001\n(2.27)\n\u03b9\u03c6 (t, \u03c3) = t + i \u03c6t (t, \u03c3), \u03c3 + i \u03c6\u03c3 (t, \u03c3)\n\npulls back \u03c91 (which is only defined on M0 via the formulae (2.10)) to a complexvalued 1-form that extends smoothly across the curve \u03c3 = 0. This is not so surprising since, when n is odd, the mapping (w, \u03b6) 7\u2192 (w, \u2212\u03b6) is J0 -antilinear on M0 and\n\u03b9\u03c6 intertwines this mapping with the orientation reversing mapping (t, \u03c3) 7\u2192 (t, \u2212\u03c3)\non V . In any case, \u03b9\u03c6 \u2217 (\u03c91 ) is a (1, 0)-form for a natural complex structure on V\nthat makes \u03b9\u03c6 into a J0 -complex curve away from the locus \u03c3 = 0.\nThe picture when n is even is slightly more complicated and is left to the reader.\n3. Local uniqueness\nSuppose now that A \u2282 C is a connected, nonsingular real-analytic curve. The\ngoal now is to determine whether A is the fixed locus of a nonsingular SO(n)invariant special Lagrangian (n+1)-fold L \u2282 Cn+1 and, if so, in how many ways.\nRemark 5 (Lack of uniqueness). As has already been remarked, if A = L \u2229 C\nfor some embedded nonsingular SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian (n+1)-fold L,\nthen A = \u03bbj \u22c6L \u2229 C for any integer j in the range 0 \u2264 j < n. Moreover, since L is\nembedded, A has an open neighborhood U \u2282 Cn+1 so that\n(3.1)\n\n\u03bbj \u22c6L \u2229 \u03bbk \u22c6L \u2229 U = A\n\n\f12\n\nR.

Reduction to an equation. Using the action (2.17), to understand the local\npicture, it suffices to understand the case where the curve A passes through the\norigin 0 \u2208 Cn+1 , its tangent there is spanned by \u2202/\u2202x0 , and T0 L = Rn+1 is spanned\nby \u2202/\u2202x0 , \u2202/\u2202x1 , . . . , \u2202/\u2202xn .\nAs in \u00a72.4, it follows that, in a neighborhood of 0 \u2208 Cn+1 , L can be described\nas a graph of the form (2.18) for some function F of the form (2.19), where \u03c6 is a\nreal-analytic function on a neighborhood of 0 \u2208 R2 .\nBy hypothesis, A can be parametrized near 0 \u2208 Cn+1 in the form\n\u0001\n(3.2)\nt + i f0\u2032 (t), 0, . . . , 0\n\nfor some function f0 that is real-analytic in a neighborhood of 0 \u2208 R and abides f0\u2032 (0) =\nf0\u2032\u2032 (0) = 0. The function f0 can be made unique by requiring that f0 (0) = 0. (The\nreason for starting with f0\u2032 instead of f0 should be apparent.)\nNow, the condition that L contain A becomes the condition\n(3.3)\n\n\u03c6(t, 0) = f0 (t).\n\n(Bear in mind the normalizations F (0, . . . , 0) = f0 (0) = 0.)

Theorem 8.0.3 of [2] is considerably more general than the\nresult stated here as Theorem 1.

Existence will follow\nonce this series is shown to converge.\nThis suggests looking for a solution to (3.6) of the form\n(4.8)\n\n\u03c6(t, \u03c3) = f0 (t) +\n\n\u0001\n1\nf1 (t) + u(t, \u03c3) \u03c3 2\n2\n\nwhere f1 (t) is defined in terms of the real-analytic function f0 via (3.10) and where u\nis a real-analytic function defined on a neighborhood of the origin in R2 that satisfies u(t, 0) \u2261 0.\nNow, substituting (4.8) into the equation (3.8) yields an equation for u of the\nform (4.1) where G is taken to be the analytic function\n(4.9)\nn\nh\nG = Im (1 + i(f1 (t)+2Z0,0 +Z1,0 ))n\u22121 \u03c3 2 (f1\u2032 (t)+2Z0,1 +Z1,1 )2\n\u0001\n\u0001io\n.\n+ 1 + i(f0\u2032\u2032 (t)+ 21 (f1\u2032\u2032 (t)+Z0,2 )\u03c3 2 ) 1+i(f1 (t)+2Z0,0 +4Z1,0 +Z2,0 )\n\nIn order to apply Theorem 1, the four hypotheses on G must now be verified.\nTo verify the first hypothesis, note that\n\u0001\n(4.10)\nG(t, 0) = Im (1 + if1 (t))n ( 1 + if0\u2032\u2032 (t) ) .\n\nOf course, f1 was defined so that the expression on the right hand side would vanish\nidentically.\nTo verify the second hypothesis, note that each of the variables Z0,1 , Z1,1 and Z0,2\noccur in the formula (4.9) with a coefficient that is a positive power of \u03c3. Of course,\nthis immediately implies that\n(4.11)\n\n\u2202G\n\u2202G\n\u2202G\n(t, 0) \u2261\n(t, 0) \u2261\n(t, 0) \u2261 0.\n\u2202Z0,1\n\u2202Z1,1\n\u2202Z0,2\n\nThe third and fourth hypotheses follow from the easily derived formulae\n(4.12)\n\n\u2202G\n(0, 0) = 1 ,\n\u2202Z2,0\n\n\u2202G\n(0, 0) = n+3 ,\n\u2202Z1,0\n\n\u2202G\n(0, 0) = 2n .\n\u2202Z0,0\n\nThus, Theorem 1 applies: There exists a unique real-analytic function u defined\non a neighborhood of the origin in R2 that satisfies the equation (4.1) where G is\ndefined as in (4.9) and the initial condition u(t, 0) \u2261 0.\nBecause G as defined in (4.9) is an even function of \u03c3, the function v defined\nby v(t, \u03c3) = u(t, \u2212\u03c3) also satisfies (4.1). Since v(t, 0) \u2261 0, the uniqueness part of\nTheorem 1 implies that v(t, \u03c3) = u(t, \u03c3), i.e., that u(t, \u2212\u03c3) = u(t, \u03c3).\nFinally, using this solution u to define \u03c6 via (4.8), the desired local existence is\nestablished. In particular, the series for \u03c6 defined via (3.10) and (3.14) must be\nconvergent on some neighborhood of (0, 0) \u2208 R2 .\n\u0003\n\n\fSO(n)-INVARIANT SPECIAL LAGRANGIANS WITH FIXED LOCI\n\n17\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this last section, the local pde results of the previous sections will be applied\nto prove the main results.\nThe first result is an 'n-uniqueness' theorem:\nTheorem 2. Suppose that L and L\u2032 are nonsingular, embedded SO(n)-invariant\nspecial Lagrangian submanifolds of Cn+1 that have the same fixed locus A \u2282 C and\nthat, moreover, A is connected.\nThen there is an open A-neighborhood U \u2282 Cn+1 and a unique integer j satisfying 0 \u2264 j < n such that\nL\u2032 \u2229 U = \u03bbj \u22c6L \u2229 U.\n\n(5.1)\n\nMoreover, when 0 \u2264 j < k < n, the submanifolds \u03bbj \u22c6L \u2229 U and \u03bbk \u22c6L \u2229 U intersect\nonly along A.\nProof. If A is empty, then there is nothing to prove, so assume that A is nonempty\nand that z = (z0 , 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 A. Both Tz L and Tz L\u2032 are special Lagrangian (n+1)planes that contain the line Tz A and hence there is an integer j in the range 0 \u2264 j <\nn and an angle \u03c8 in the range 0 \u2264 \u03c8 < \u03c0 such that Tz L = P\u03c8 and Tz L\u2032 = P\u03c8+(j/n)\u03c0 .\nBy applying a motion in the group generated by the mappings (2.17), it can be\nassumed that z = 0 \u2208 Cn+1 and that Tz L = Rn+1 = P0 . Then Tz (\u03bb\u2212j \u22c6L\u2032 ) =\nTz L = P0 as well.\nSince L and L\u2032 are embedded, it follows that there is an open neighborhood Wz\nof 0 \u2208 Rn+1 and an open neighborhood Uz of 0 \u2208 Cn+1 such that there exist unique\nreal-analytic functions F and F \u2032 defined on Wz and vanishing at 0 \u2208 Rn+1 so that\no\nn\n\u0001\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nx\n+\ni\n(x\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nx\n)\n\u2208\nW\n(5.2)\nL \u2229 Uz = x0 + i \u2202x\nn\n0\nn\nz\n\u2202xn\n0\nwhile\n(5.3)\n\n\u03bb\u2212j \u22c6L\u2032 \u2229 Uz =\n\nn\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2202F\nx0 + i \u2202F\n\u2202x0 , . . . , xn + i \u2202xn\n\n\u0001\n\n(x0 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Wz\n\no\n\n.\n\nSince Tz (\u03bb\u2212j \u22c6L\u2032 ) = Tz L = Rn+1 , it follows that F and F \u2032 have vanishing first\nand second derivatives at 0 \u2208 Rn+1 . As was argued in the proof of Proposition 1,\nit follows that there unique exist real-analytic functions \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 defined on a\nneighborhood of (0, 0) in R2 such that \u03c6(0, 0) = \u03c6\u2032 (0, 0) = 0 and such that\np\n\u0001\nF (x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03c6 x0 , x1 2 +* * *+xn 2\n(5.4)\np\n\u0001\nF \u2032 (x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u03c6\u2032 x0 , x1 2 +* * *+xn 2\n\nwhen x0 2 +* * *+xn 2 is sufficiently small. Since L \u2229 Uz \u2229 C = L\u2032 \u2229 Uz \u2229 C = A \u2229 Uz ,\nit follows that \u03c6(t, 0) = \u03c6\u2032 (t, 0) for |t| sufficiently small. Moreover, by construction, \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 are solutions of (3.6) that are even in the second variable (i.e., \u03c3).\nBecause Tz (\u03bb\u2212j \u22c6L\u2032 ) = Tz L = Rn+1 , it follows that \u03c6\u03c3\u03c3 (0, 0) = \u03c6\u2032\u03c3\u03c3 (0, 0) = 0 and,\nsetting f0 (t) = \u03c6(t, 0) = \u03c6\u2032 (t, 0), that f0 (0) = f0\u2032 (0) = f0\u2032\u2032 (0) = 0.\nNow Proposition 2 implies that \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 , which, in turn, implies that L \u2229 Uz =\n\u2212j\n\u03bb \u22c6L\u2032 \u2229 Uz .\nSince z was chosen arbitrarily in A, it has been established that every z \u2208 A\nhas an open neighborhood Uz \u2282 Cn+1 such that there exists a unique integer jz\nsatisfying 0 \u2264 jz < n so that L\u2032 \u2229 Uz = (\u03bbjz \u22c6L) \u2229 Uz . Moreover, by shrinking Uz\nappropriately, it can be arranged that, when 0 \u2264 j < k mod n, the two manifolds (\u03bbj \u22c6L) and (\u03bbk \u22c6L) \u2229 Uz only intersect along A \u2229 Uz .\n\n\f18\n\nR. BRYANT\n\nIn particular, it follows that the integer jz is locally constant in z and hence,\nsince A is connected, it follows that there is a unique integer j in the range 0 \u2264 j < n\nsuch that jz = j for all z \u2208 A.\nNow let U be the union of the Uz as z ranges over A. Then U and j have the\nrequired properties.\n\u0003\nThe second main result is an existence result:\nTheorem 3. Suppose that A \u2282 C is an embedded, connected real-analytic curve\nand that either A is noncompact or else that n = 2. Then there exists an embedded,\nconnected special Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 Cn+1 that is SO(n)-invariant and\nsatisfies L \u2229 C = A.\nProof. Consider the set B that consists of the pairs (z, P\u03c8 ) with z \u2208 A such that P\u03c8\nis a special Lagrangian plane of the form (2.15) that contains the line Tz A. By the\ndiscussion in \u00a72.3, it follows that B is a Zn -bundle over A.\nIf A is noncompact, then this bundle is trivial and there exists a continuous\n(in fact, real-analytic) \u03c8 : A \u2192 R such that (z, P\u03c8(z) ) is a section of B over all\nof A. If A is compact and n = 2, then the argument given at the end of the proof\nof Proposition 1 shows that, because the rotation number of A is \u00b11, the bundle B\nis trivial in this case as well, so that, again, there is a mapping \u03c8 : A \u2192 R/(\u03c0Z) so\nthat that (z, P\u03c8(z) ) is a section of B over all of A.\nNow, Proposition 3, together with the assumption that A is embedded, implies\nthat every point z \u2208 A has an open neighborhood Uz \u2282 Cn+1 that intersects A in a\nconnected arc Uz \u2229 A and in which there exists an embedded, nonsingular, SO(n)invariant special Lagrangian submanifold, say Lz \u2282 Uz such that Lz \u2229 C = A \u2229 Uz .\nBy Theorem 2, this Lz can be made unique by requiring that Tz (Lz ) = P\u03c8(z) .\nBy the connectedness of Uz \u2229A, and the continuity of \u03c8, it follows that Tw (Lz ) =\nP\u03c8(w) = Tw (Lw ) for any w \u2208 Uz \u2229 A. Consequently, Ty (Lz ) = Ty (Lw ) for all y \u2208\nUz \u2229 Uw \u2229 A. It then follows from Theorem 2 that Lz and Lw are equal in some\nopen neighborhood of the interval Uz \u2229 Uw \u2229 A.\nIt is now not difficult to conclude that there exists an open neighborhood U\nof A itself and an embedded, nonsingular, SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 Cn+1 that agrees with Lz on some open neighborhood of z for\neach z \u2208 A.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] I.
