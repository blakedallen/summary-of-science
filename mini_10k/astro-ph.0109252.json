The most successful survey would be the Hubble Deep Fields which are deep enough\nto study high-z galaxies up to z \u2243 6. Many efforts on spectroscopic and photometric follow-up\nobservations reveal hundreds of high-z galaxies and their properties (e.g.[5]). However the surveyed\nareas of HDFs are as small as a few arcmin2 each, so they may be affected by field-to-field variations.\nSteidel and his collaborators have pioneered in statistical studies of high-z galaxies based on groundbased wide survey data [20]. They isolate high-z galaxies in a two-color plane using the UV continuum\nfeatures, and galaxies selected in this way are called Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). They studied the\nnumber density [21], the spatial distribution [6], nebular emission lines [18], and the stellar population\n[15]. Most of their studies are based on z \u223c 3 LBG samples which were selected using Un GR colors.\nIn this contribution, we extend the study to z \u223c 4 LBGs based on our BRi\u2032 data taken with a\nnewly installed Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam:[12]), which is a unique wide-field imager\nmounted on the 8m Subaru Telescope. Throughout this contribution, magnitudes are in the AB\nsystem, and all calculations assume a \u039b-dominated spatially flat cosmology, (\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.3, 0.7).\n\n2\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nDeep and wide-field B-,V -,R-, and i\u2032 -band imaging data of a central 30\u2032 \u00d724\u2032 area in the Subaru/XMMNewton Deep Survey Field (2h 18m 00s ,\u22125\u25e6 12\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 [J2000]) were taken with Suprime-Cam during the\ncommissioning observing runs on 2000 November 24-27. The present work is based on the B,R, and\n\n\fFigure 1: Left panel: B \u2212 R vs. R \u2212 i\u2032 color diagram displaying the colors of model galaxies and stars.\nTypical spectra of elliptical, Sbc, Scd and irregular galaxies [4] are redshifted from z = 0 to z = 3,\nwhich are shown by four dashed lines. Each line has filled circles at z=0,1,2 and 3. We use a typical\nspectrum of galaxies at z \u2243 3 to compute the z \u223c 4 galaxy track which is shown by the solid line [13].\nStar marks are 175 Galactic stars given by [7]. The arrow expresses the direction and magnitude of\ndust extinction on the B \u2212 R vs. R \u2212 i\u2032 plane for E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.15, when Calzetti's extinction law\n[3] is applied. The box surrounding the upper left region is the selection criteria of our z \u223c 4 galaxies\n(equation 1). No obvious contaminant is found within the box.

The individual CCD data were reduced and combined using IRAF and the mosaic-CCD data\nreduction software developed by us [23]. The final images cover a contiguous 618 arcmin2 area with a\npoint-spread function FWHM of 0\u2032\u2032 .98. The net exposure times of the final images are 177, 58, and 45\nminutes for B, R, and i\u2032 , respectively. The limiting magnitudes are B = 27.6, R = 26.5, and i\u2032 = 26.2\nfor a 3\u03c3 detection in a 2\u2032\u2032 diameter aperture. The i\u2032 -band frame is chosen to detect objects, and we\nlimit the object catalog to i\u2032 <\n\u223c 26, in order to provide a reasonable level of photometric completeness.\n\n3\n\nSelection of z\u223c4 Lyman Break Galaxies\n\nOur catalog contains 42,557 objects with i\u2032 \u2264 26.0 in total. On the basis of expectations from\nGISSEL96 [2] population synthesis models, we define the photometric selection criteria for galaxies at\nz \u223c 4 ([13] for model parameters) as\nB \u2212 R > 2.1, R \u2212 i\u2032 < 0.5, B \u2212 R > 5.4(R \u2212 i\u2032 ) + 0.9\n\n(1)\n\nWe estimate the redshift distribution, N (z), of galaxies satisfying equation (1) from the HDF-N objects\nfor which magnitudes, colors, and photometric redshifts are given in [5]. We find that the criteria select\nz = 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 galaxies. There are a total of 1192 objects that meet the criteria. Figure 1 shows the\nB \u2212 R vs. R \u2212 i\u2032 color diagram for model galaxies and Gunn & Stryker's stars [7] (left panel), and for\n5\u03c3 detected objects in our data (right panel). The left panel demonstrates that z \u223c 4 galaxies are well\nisolated from interlopers, i.e., low-z galaxies and Galactic stars. We have estimated the contamination\nand completeness of our LBG sample by Monte Carlo simulations, generating artificial objects which\nmimic the HDF-N galaxies and distributing them on our original images. The contamination is defined,\nfor the detected simulated objects, as the ratio of low-redshift (z < 3.3) objects meeting equation (1)\nto all the objects satisfying equation (1). The completeness is defined as the ratio of z \u2243 4 simulated\nobjects passing our detection threshold and satisfying equation (1) to all (detected + undetected)\nz \u2243 4 simulated objects. We find from the simulations that the completeness and the contamination\nare 45% and 17%, respectively.\n\n\fFigure 2: (a) Luminosity function (LF) of z \u223c 4 LBGs, together with those for z = 0 and 3 galaxies.\nThe filled circles indicate z \u223c 4 LBGs derived from our data, and the squares are for the z \u223c 4\ngalaxies from the HDF photo-z catalog [5]. The solid line shows the best fitted Schechter function to\nthe z \u223c 4 data. The dashed line is the LF of UV selected galaxies at z = 0 (whose magnitudes are\nin MAB (2000\u00c5) [22].) The dotted line denotes the LF of z \u223c 3 LBGs [21]. A large population of\nUV-luminous (MAB <\n\u223c \u221220) galaxies is seen at z \u223c 3 and 4. (b) LFs of the red and blue subsamples.\nThe filled circles and filled squares show the red sample, while the open circles and open squares are for\nthe blue sample. The solid line is the best fitted Schechter function obtained from the whole sample,\nwhich is shown as the solid line in (a). See text for details.\n\n4\n\nLuminosity Function\n\nThe UV luminosity function (LF) of z \u223c 4 LBGs is derived from our 1192 objects with i\u2032 < 26. We\ncalculate the surveyed effective volume which is the integrated volume from z = 3.3 to z = 4.3 by\ntaking into account the completeness and contamination of the sample selection, and N(z) (\u00a73). The\nLF is shown in figure 2(a), together with those at z = 0 [22] and z \u223c 3 [21]. The LF of our z \u223c 4\nLBG sample is consistent with the one derived by [21]. We fit the Schechter function to the LF, and\n\u2217 (1700\u00c5) = \u221220.41, \u03c6\u2217 = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 with a fixed slope \u03b1 = \u22121.6. It is found from figure\nfind MAB\n2(a), that all the LFs from z=0 to 4 seem to prefer a steep slope, \u03b1 \u2243 \u22121.6. The M \u2217 s at z \u223c3 and\n4 are about 2 magnitude brighter than that at z=0. The number of bright (MAB (1700\u00c5) <\n\u223c \u221220)\ngalaxies are much larger at high redshifts than in the local universe, while that of faint galaxies are\ncomparable. This implies that a large population of UV-luminous galaxies exists only at high redshifts.\nThis population reflects the high cosmic starformation rates at high redshifts, which were derived by\n[10] and [21]. There are two extreme explanations for this population. One is that the star-formation\nrate of z \u223c 3 \u2212 4 galaxies is intrinsically higher than that for z = 0 galaxies, and the other is that the\nz \u223c 3 \u2212 4 galaxies are very dust-poor (or partially dust free) and thus the M \u2217 values are apparently\nbrighter than that for z = 0 galaxies which suffer from non-neglibible dust extinction. A detailed\ndiscussion will be given in [14].\nWe divide our whole LBG sample into two subsamples, blue and red, by the R \u2212 i\u2032 color. The\nblue (red) sample is composed of objects bluer (redder) than the median color of the whole sample,\nhR \u2212 i\u2032 i = 0.12. The LFs of red and blue samples are calculated in the same manner as for the whole\nsample. Figure 2(b) shows the LFs of red and blue samples. These LFs are not significantly different\nat the faint end (MAB > \u221220.3), however, the LF of red sample seems to be higher than that of the\nblue sample at the bright end (MAB < \u221220.3). This may imply that the bright LBGs are dominated\nby galaxies red in the R \u2212 i\u2032 color. The R \u2212 i color reflects the shape of UV continuum between\n1380 \u2212 1620\u00c5 for z = 3.8 LBGs 1 , and the difference in the color is thought to be caused by various\n1\n\n1530\u00c5\u22121810\u00c5 for z = 3.3 LBGs, 1250\u00c5\u22121470\u00c5 for z = 4.3 LBGs\n\n\fFigure 3: (a) Sky distribution of the z \u223c 4 LBGs. Different symbols correspond to different magnitude\nbins defined in the panel. Masked regions, to avoid the effects of bright stars, are shown as dotted\ncircles. (b) Angular correlation function for the z \u223c 4 LBGs. The solid line shows the best-fit power\nlaw with \u03c9(\u03b8) = A\u03c9 \u03b8 \u22120.8 .\nreasons, for example, differences in dust extinction, stellar population, and redshift. If the difference\nin the color is mainly originated from the dust extinction, the boundary of the color, R \u2212 i = 0.12,\nis estimated to be E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.18, following [11]. If this is the case, the brighter LBGs may be\ndominated by dusty LBGs with E(B \u2212 V ) > 0.18. Note that in deriving the red and blue LFs, we\nassume that the completeness and the contamination of these subsamples are the same as for the\nwhole sample. We should point out the possibility that the difference in red and blue LFs comes from\na systematic difference in the completeness and contamination factors of the blue and red samples.\n\n5\n\nAngular Correlation Function\n\nFigure 3(a) shows the sky distribtuion of z \u223c 4 LBGs in our sample. In this figure, we find a somewhat\ninhomogeneous distribtution of LBGs, especially for bright (i\u2032 < 24.5) ones. We derive the angular\ntwo-point correlation function \u03c9(\u03b8) using the estimator defined by [9] (see [13]). The resulting angular\ncorrelation function for the sample is shown in figure 3(b) 2 .\nWe fit a power law, \u03c9(\u03b8) = A\u03c9 \u03b8 \u2212\u03b2 , to the data points, and find the slope \u03b2 = 0.6+0.6\n\u22120.4 , which is\nconsistent with those for nearby galaxies, \u03b2 = 0.7 \u2212 0.8, though the errors in our estimate are large.\nThe best fit value for \u03b2 \u2261 0.8 is A\u03c9 = 0.71 \u00b1 0.26 in units of arcsec\u03b2 .\nThe two-point angular correlation function is related to the spatial correlation function \u03be(r) =\n(r/r0 )\u2212\u03b3 by an integral equation, the Limber transformation [17]. We apply the Limber transformation\nto the best fit value of A\u03c9 with \u03b2 \u2261 0.8, using the redshift distribution N (z) of the LBGs (\u00a73). The\n\u22121 Mpc. This is twice as large as the correlation length\nobtained correlation length is r0 = 2.7+0.5\n\u22120.6 h\nof the dark matter at z \u2243 4 predicted from an analytic model by [16]. The difference is thought\nto be due to the biasing of galaxy distribution, which is characterized by the biasing factor, b, as\n\u03begal (r) = b2 \u03bematter (r). We obtain a linear bias b \u2243 2.6, which is similar to that found by [6] for bright\nz \u2243 3 LBGs. On the other hand, the semianalytic models predict much stronger clustering for galaxies\n( eg. [1], [8]). A further discussion requires a detailed comparison of galaxy properties and selection\ncriteria, between galaxies in the models and LBGs in our sample.\n\u2032\u2032\nIn figure 3(b), we find an excess 3 of \u03c9(\u03b8) at small scales (\u03b8 <\n\u223c 5 ) at > 3\u03c3 significance levels,\n2\nError bars do not include sample variance caused from field-to-field variations. The effect of the variations in our\nsample is propably modest since our sample probes a large comoving volume, 36 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 520 = 6.7 \u00d7 105 h\u22121 Mpc3 .\n3\nWith a visual inspection, we find that all the galaxies contributing to the excess are real; no artificial objects, such\nas halos of bright stars, are found to be included in them.\n\n\frelative to the best-fit power law. This can be caused by various effects; for example, galaxy-galaxy\nmergers, two galaxies within a common dark matter halo, and/or field variance. If we interpret this as\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers of those i\u2032 < 26 LBGs, which are classified as bright LBGs with M (1700\u00c5) <\n\u223c\nM \u2217 (1700\u00c5) (\u00a74), we can calculate, following [19], the fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers as\nfrom the observed and expected numbers of galaxy pairs with a separation of 1.\u2032\u2032 5 < \u03b8 < 4\u2032\u2032 (the\nprojected physical separation corresponds to 7.5 to 20 h\u22121 kpc at z = 3.8). The resulting value is\nfpair = 3.0 \u00b1 0.9%. This value is significantly smaller than those for intermediate-redshift (z \u223c 0.3)\n\u22121\ngalaxies whose fpair at <\n\u223c 20 h kpc is 5 \u2212 15% (e.g. [19]).\nAcknowledgements.
