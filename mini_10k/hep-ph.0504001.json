Concluding Remarks\n\n43\n\n1. Introduction\nThe minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model [1] provides a convenient and popular template for exploration of many of the phenomenological consequences of weak scale supersymmetry [2]. In mSUGRA, it is assumed that supersymmetry is broken in a hidden\nsector of the model, with SUSY breaking communicated to the visible sector via gravitational interactions. The qualifier \"minimal\" in mSUGRA refers to the assumption of a\nflat K\u00e4hler metric, which leads to universal tree level scalar masses at some high energy\nscale, usually taken to be Q = MGU T . The universality assumption ensures the super-GIM\nmechanism [3], which suppresses unwanted flavor-changing neutral current effects. An attractive feature of this framework is that electroweak symmetry can be radiatively broken\n(REWSB). This allows one to eliminate the superpotential |\u03bc| parameter in favor of MZ ,\nand the low energy phenomenology is then determined by the well-known parameter space\nmSUGRA :\n\nm0 , m1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2, and sign(\u03bc).\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n(1.1)\n\n\fHere m0 is the common GUT scale scalar mass, m1/2 is the common GUT scale gaugino\nmass, A0 is the common GUT scale trilinear term, tan \u03b2 is the weak scale ratio of Higgs\nfield vacuum expectation values, and \u03bc is the superpotential Higgs mass term. We take\nmt = 178 GeV throughout this paper.\nThe mSUGRA model has been criticized because the assumption of universal scalar\nmasses is ad hoc and does not follow from any known symmetry principle [4]. While it is\npossible to invoke an additional global U (N ) symmetry for the (gravitational) interactions\nof the N chiral supermultiplets, this symmetry is clearly not respected by superpotential\nYukawa couplings, and radiative corrections involving these Yukawa interactions can lead\nto large deviations from the universality hypothesis [5].\nThe assumption of equality of scalar masses receives partial support in Grand Unified\nTheories (GUTs). For instance, in SO(10) SUSY GUT models, all matter superfields of\na single generation belong to a 16 dimensional spinor representation \u03c8\u0302(16) of SO(10),\nand their mass degeneracy is guaranteed if SUSY breaking masses are acquired above the\nSO(10) breaking scale. If the mechanism by which matter scalars acquire SUSY breaking\nmasses is generation blind, universality of matter scalar masses would then obtain. In the\ncase of minimal SO(10) SUSY GUTs, the two MSSM Higgs doublet superfields \u0124u and \u0124d\nbelong to the same 10 dimensional fundamental representation \u03c6\u0302(10), so the corresponding\nSUSY breaking scalar mass terms would not be expected to be the same as those of the\nmatter scalars. The phenomenologically desirable super-GIM mechanism would be ensured\nby requiring a U (3) symmetry amongst the different generations. In practice, the amount\nof degeneracy needed is greatest for the first two generations where FCNC constraints\nare the strongest, while the corresponding constraints for the third generation are rather\nmild [6]. The need for generational degeneracy can be further reduced if one invokes as well\na degree of alignment between squark and quark mass matrices, or a (partial) decoupling\nsolution to the SUSY flavor problem.\nIn this paper, we will maintain degeneracy amongst matter scalars at scales Q \u2243\nMGU T , but will allow non-universality to enter the model via soft SUSY breaking masses\nfor the Higgs scalars. In our analysis, we will differentiate between two cases for the\nnon-universal Higgs mass (NUHM) models. Inspired by GUT models where both MSSM\nHiggs doublets are contained in a single superfield, we will first examine the NUHM model\nwhere m2Hu = m2Hd 6= m20 at Q = MGU T . In this case, we define the new parameter\nq\nm\u03c6 = sign(m2Hu ,d ) * |m2Hu,d | at the GUT scale. Thus, the parameter space of this one\n\nparameter extension of the mSUGRA model is given by,\nNUHM1 :\n\nm0 , m\u03c6 , m1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2 and sign(\u03bc).\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe second case is inspired by GUT models where \u0124u and \u0124d belong to different\nmultiplets. The parameter space for this second case is then given by\nNUHM2 :\n\nm0 , m2Hu , m2Hd , m1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2 and sign(\u03bc).\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe conditions of electroweak gauge symmetry breaking allows one to trade the GUT scale\nmasses m2Hu and m2Hd for the weak scale parameters \u03bc and mA .\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fWe remark that regardless of any theoretical motivation, if any small departure from\na well-motivated framework such as mSUGRA causes significant differences in the phenomenological outcome, the new framework is worthy of examination. We will see below\nthat enlarging the model parameter space to split off the GUT scale Higgs boson mass\nparameters from those of other scalars leads to significant departures from mSUGRA\nexpectations upon the incorporation of the WMAP constraint on the relic density of\ncold dark matter. Motivated by this, our goal here is to explore in detail the phenomenological consequences of the NUHM1 and NUHM2 models. Before doing so, we\nnote that the mSUGRA model has recently been tightly constrained by several measurements [7]. These include 1.) the combined measurement [8] of the branching fraction\nBF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) = (3.25 \u00b1 0.37) \u00d7 10\u22124 , 2.) the measurement [9] of the deviation of the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment \u2206a\u03bc \u2261 \u2206(g \u2212 2)\u03bc /2 = (27 \u00b1 10) \u00d7 10\u221210 from the SM prediction [10], and 3.) the WMAP determination of the relic density of cold dark matter (CDM)\nin the universe [11]: \u03a9CDM h2 = 0.113 \u00b1 0.009. In addition, we invoke the usual constraint\nfrom LEP2 that charginos should have mass mW\nf1 \u2265 103.5 GeV. We remark that there\ncould be significant theoretical uncertainties in the evaluation of both \u2206a\u03bc and, especially\nfor large values of tan \u03b2, also BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) so that any inferences from them should be\ninterpreted with care. The first two constraints favor mSUGRA models with \u03bc > 0. The\nWMAP constraint restricts the mSUGRA parameter space to lie in one of the following\nregions [12, 13, 14, 15]:\n\u2022 the bulk region at low m0 and low m1/2 , where neutralino annihilation in the early\nuniverse occurs predominantly via t-channel slepton exchange (this region is now\nessentially excluded by the combination of WMAP \u03a9CDM h2 bound and the LEP2\nbounds on mW\nf1 and mh , save where it overlaps with the stau co-annihilation region),\n\u2022 the stau co-annihilation at low m0 but almost any m1/2 value, where mZe1 \u2243 m\u03c4\u03031 [16],\nor the stop co-annihilation region for special values of A0 where mZe1 \u2243 mt\u03031 [17],\n\n\u2022 the hyperbolic branch/focus point region (HB/FP) at large m0 , where |\u03bc| becomes\nsmall, and the neutralino develops a significant higgsino component [18, 19, 20], and\n\u2022 the A-annihilation funnel at large tan \u03b2, where 2mZe1 \u223c mA , and neutralino annihilation in the early universe occurs via the broad A and H Higgs boson resonances [21].\nA light Higgs resonance annihilation region may also be possible at low m1/2 values\nwhere 2mZe1 \u2243 mh [22].\n\nThroughout this work, we use Isajet 7.72 to generate sparticle mass spectra [23], IsaReD [13]\nfor the relic density calculation, and the DarkSUSY package [24] for the computation of dark\nmatter detection rates.\nAt this point, we would like to take note of a variety of earlier studies of models with\nnon-universal Higgs masses. SUGRA models with non-universal Higgs masses were first\nstudied by Berezinski et al., who focussed on direct detection of neutralino dark matter [27] and indirect detection via neutrino telescopes[28]. Around the same time, direct\ndetection of neutralino dark matter in NUHM models was also investigated by Arnowitt\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fand Nath [29], and subsequently by Bottino et al.[30]. These latter papers explored only\nthe case of positive squared Higgs masses. Bottino et al. explored direct DM detection\nfor cases including negative squared Higgs masses in Ref. [31]. Ellis et al. [32] made a\nthorough exploration of parameter space of the NUHM2 model using the \u03bc and mA variables, and investigated direct detection rates in Ref. [33]. Indirect detection via neutrinos\nwas investigated by Barger et al.[34] for models with universality and non-universality.\nRecently, both direct[35] and indirect[36] detection of neutralino dark matter has been\ninvestigated by Munoz et al. in the context of models with both scalar and gaugino mass\nnon-universality.\nOur present study goes beyond these previous works in several respects:\n1) we investigate the more constrained NUHM1 model in Sec. 2, and show for the first\ntime that in this minimal (one parametric extension) of mSUGRA model there are always\ntwo solutions for low relic density: one is neutralino annihilation via heavy Higgs resonance\neven at low values of tan \u03b2 while the other is neutralino annihilation via higgsino components at low values of m0 ;\n2) we find new allowed regions of the NUHM2 model \u2013 the light squark/slepton coannihilation regions as discussed in Sec. 3;\n3) we investigate direct and indirect detection of neutralino dark matter, including antimatter, neutrino and gamma ray indirect searches for the new parameter regions mentioned\nabove;\n4) for the first time, we consider the implications of the NUHM1 and NUHM2 models for\ncollider searches at the Fermilab Tevatron, CERN LHC and ILC linear e+ e\u2212 colliders, and\nshow how these correlate with the direct and indirect dark matter searches. In this connection, we also emphasize the sensitivity of the implications of the WMAP measurement\nof \u03a9CDM h2 for collider expectations to the underlying framework. In particular, we show\nthat inferences valid in the mSUGRA model may simply be invalid in the extended NUHM\nframework.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we explore the allowed\nregions of the NUHM1 model which was first studied in Ref. [25]. We will find that even\nfor low values of m0 , raising the ratio m\u03c6 /m0 brings us into the low |\u03bc| region where the\nrelic density is in accord with the WMAP allowed range; this is quite unlike the situation\nin mSUGRA where the higgsino annihilation region occurs only at multi-TeV values of\nm0 . In addition, lowering the ratio m\u03c6 /m0 into the range of negative values decreases the\nvalue of mA until the A-annihilation funnel is reached. In this case, the A-funnel region\ncan occur at any tan \u03b2 value where an acceptable spectrum can be generated.\nWe introduce and outline in Sec 2.3 the computation of direct and indirect dark matter\nrates. We make use of consistent halo models in the attempt to systematically compare\nthe reach in all various detection channels. We find enhanced signal rates for direct and\nindirect detection of neutralino cold dark matter in these WMAP-allowed regions [26].\nIn Sec. 2.5, we explore some unique consequences of the NUHM1 model for collider\nsearches. In the higgsino region of the NUHM1 model, charginos and neutralinos all become\nrather light, and more easily accessible to collider searches. In addition, lengthy gluino\nand squark cascade decays to the various charginos and neutralinos occur, leading to the\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fpossibility of spectacular events at the CERN LHC. In the A-funnel region, the A, H and\nH \u00b1 Higgs bosons may be kinematically accessible to searches at the International Linear\nCollider (ILC) or at the CERN LHC, and may also be present in gluino and squark cascade\ndecays.\nIn Sec. 3, we explore the NUHM2 model. In this case, since \u03bc and mA can now be\nused as input parameters, it is always possible to choose values such that one lies either\nin the higgsino annihilation region or in the A-funnel region, for any value of tan \u03b2, m0 or\nm1/2 that gives rise to a calculable SUSY mass spectrum. In the low \u03bc region, charginos\nand neutralinos are again likely to be light, and possibly accessible to Fermilab Tevatron,\nCERN LHC and ILC searches. If instead one is in the A-annihilation funnel, then the\nheavier Higgs scalars may be light enough to be produced at observable rates at hadron or\nlepton colliders. In addition, new regions are found where consistency with WMAP data\nis obtained because either \u0169R , c\u0303R squarks or left- sleptons become very light. The \u0169R and\nc\u0303R co-annihilation region leads to large rates for direct and indirect detection of neutralino\ndark matter, and is in fact already constrained by searches from CDMS2. We present a\nsummary and our conclusions in Sec. 4.\n\n2. NUHM1 model\n2.1 Overview\nIn this section, we investigate the phenomenology of the NUHM1 model, wherein the Higgs\nmasses m2Hu = m2Hd \u2261 sign(m\u03c6 ) * |m\u03c6 |2 at Q = MGU T , with m2\u03c6 6= m20 . We first note that\nthe parameter range for m\u03c6 need not be limited to positive values at the GUT scale, and\nthat, indeed, to achieve radiative EWSB, m2Hu must evolve to negative values. Indeed,\nnegative squared Higgs mass parameters (at Q = MGU T ) are predicted in the SU (5) fixed\npoint scenario of Ref. [37].\nWe also note that some authors impose so-called GUT stability (GS) bounds,\nm2Hu (MGU T ) + \u03bc2 (MGU T ) > 0 and\n\n(2.1)\n\nm2Hd (MGU T ) +\n\n(2.2)\n\n2\n\n\u03bc (MGU T ) > 0 ,\n\nto avoid EWSB at too high a scale. The reliability of these bounds is debated in Refs. [38];\nhere we will merely remark on regions of parameter space where they occur, and leave it\nto the reader to decide whether or not to impose them.\nWe show one of the critical aspects of the NUHM1 model in Fig. 1, where we plot the\nvalues of \u03bc, mA , mZe1 and 2mZe1 versus m\u03c6 while fixing m0 = m1/2 = 300 GeV, with A0 = 0,\ntan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0. The region to the left of the dot-dashed line indicates where the GS\nbound fails. The curves terminate because electroweak symmetry breaking is not obtained\nas marked on the figure: in fact, on the right, where |\u03bc| becomes small, the chargino mass\nfalls below the LEP bound just before the EWSB constraint kicks in. The black curve\ndenotes the value of the \u03bc parameter, which takes a value of \u03bc = 409 GeV for m\u03c6 = 300\nGeV (the mSUGRA case). The parameter \u03bc becomes much larger for m\u03c6 < \u2212m0 , and\nmuch smaller for m\u03c6 > m0 [39]. The region of small \u03bc is of particular interest since in\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fthat case the lightest neutralino develops substantial higgsino components, and leads to a\nrelic density which can be in accord with the WMAP determination. In contrast, in the\nmSUGRA model the higgsino-LSP region occurs in the HB/FP region, which occurs at\nvery large m0 values of order several TeV (depending somewhat on the assumed value of\nmt ). The HB/FP region has been criticized in the literature in that the large m0 values\nmay lead to large fine-tunings [40] (for an alternative point of view, see Refs. [18] and [19]).\nThis illustrates an important virtue of the NUHM1 model: the higgsino annihilation region\nmay be reached even with arbitrarily low values of m0 and m1/2 , provided of course that\nsparticle search bounds are respected.\nWe also see from Fig. 1 that the value of mA can range beyond its mSUGRA value for\nlarge values of m\u03c6 , to quite small values when m\u03c6 becomes less than zero. In particular,\nwhen mA \u223c 2mZe1 , neutralinos in the early universe may annihilate efficiently through the\nA and H Higgs resonances, so that again \u03a9CDM h2 may be brought into accord with the\nWMAP result. In the mSUGRA model, the A-annihilation funnel occurs only at large\ntan \u03b2 \u223c 45 \u2212 55. However, in the NUHM1 model, the A-funnel region may be reached even\nfor low tan \u03b2 values if m\u03c6 is taken to be sufficiently negative.\n\nmSUGRA\n\n1000\n\nGS bound\n\nm (GeV)\n\nm0 =300GeV, m1/2 =300GeV, tan\u03b2=10, A0 =0, \u03bc >0, mt =178GeV\n\n800\n\nNO EWSB\n\n\u03bc\nmA < 0\n\n600\n2\n\nmA\n\n400\n\n2mz1\n200\n\n0\n-1000\n\nmz1\n\n-800\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nm\u03c6 (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: Plot of \u03bc, mA and mZe1 vs. m\u03c6 for m0 = 300 GeV, m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10\nand mt = 178 GeV. We take \u03bc > 0.\n\nTo understand the behavior of the \u03bc parameter and mA in the NUHM1 model, we first\nexamine the renormalization group equations (RGEs) for the soft SUSY breaking Higgs\nsquared mass parameters.

The RGE terms including Yukawa couplings\noccur with overall positive signs, which results in driving the corresponding soft Higgs\nboson mass squared parameters to smaller (and ultimately negative) values at the low\nscale. Indeed, this is the familiar REWSB mechanism. Since Xt \u220b m2Hu , a large, positive\nvalue of m\u03c6 > m0 results in a stronger push of m2Hu to negative values (relative to that in\nmSUGRA) during the running from MGU T to Mweak , while the evolution of m2Hd is rather\nmild. Alternatively, if m\u03c6 \u226a 0, then there exist cancellations within the Xt term which\nresults in a milder running of m2Hu from MGU T to Mweak . Indeed, as shown in Ref. [25],\n\u2206m2Hu,d \u2261 m2Hu,d (NUHM1) \u2212 m2Hu,d (mSUGRA)\nsatisfies\n\u2206m2Hu (weak) \u2243 \u2206m2Hu (GUT) \u00d7 e\u2212Jt ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nZ\n3\ndtft2 > 0,\nJt = 2\n8\u03c0\nwith ft being the top quark Yukawa coupling. We see that \u2206mHu maintains its sign,\nbut reduces in magnitude under evolution from the GUT to the weak scale. The same\nargument applies for \u2206m2Hd , except that the effect of evolution is much smaller because\nfb,\u03c4 \u226a ft except when tan \u03b2 is very large. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we\nplot the running of m2Hu and m2Hd from MGU T to Mweak using the same model parameters\nas in Fig. 1, except for three choices of m\u03c6 = 500 GeV, 300 GeV (mSUGRA case) and\n\u2212700 GeV. In these cases, the weak scale values of m2Hu are \u2212(251 GeV)2 , \u2212(407 GeV)2\nand \u2212(732 GeV)2 , respectively, while the corresponding weak scale values of m2Hd are\n(527 GeV)2 , (348 GeV)2 and \u2212(672 GeV)2 .\nThe tree level minimization condition for EWSB in the MSSM is\n\nwhere\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\nm2Hd \u2212 m2Hu tan2 \u03b2\n(tan2 \u03b2 \u2212 1)\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\u2212\n\nMZ2\n.\n2\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fm\u03c6= 500GeV\n\n600\n\n2\n\nsign(mHu,d )\u221a\uf8e6mHu,d \uf8e6 (GeV)\n\nm0=300GeV, m1/2=300GeV, tan\u03b2=10, A0=0, \u03bc>0, mt=178GeV\n\n400\n\n2\n\nmSUGRA\n\n200\n\n0\n\n\u25cf Hu\n\u25cf Hd\n\n-200\n\n-400\n\nm\u03c6=-700GeV\n\n-600\n\n-800\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n13\n\n10\n\n15\n\nQ (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: The evolution of m2Hu and m2Hd from Q = MGUT to Mweak for M\u03c6 = 300 GeV (mSUGRA\ncase), 500 GeV and -700 GeV. We also take m0 = 300 GeV, m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10\nand mt = 178 GeV, with \u03bc > 0.\n\nFor moderate to large values of tan \u03b2 (as favored by LEP2 Higgs boson mass constraints),\nand |mHu | \u226b MZ , \u03bc2 \u223c \u2212m2Hu . Thus, we see that in the case of large negative m\u03c6\nvalues, we would expect a large |\u03bc| parameter, whereas for large positive m\u03c6 values, m2Hu\nis barely driven to negative values, and we expect a small |\u03bc| parameter. Within the same\napproximation, the tree level pseudoscalar Higgs mass mA is given by\nm2A = m2Hu + m2Hd + 2\u03bc2 \u2243 m2Hd \u2212 m2Hu .\n\n(2.11)\n\nFor large negative values of m\u03c6 , the weak scale values of m2Hu and m2Hd are both negative,\nand can cancel against the 2\u03bc2 term, yielding small pseudoscalar masses. Meanwhile, for\nlarge positive values of m\u03c6 , m2Hd \u223c sign(m\u03c6 )m2\u03c6 while m2Hu is small, but negative. In this\ncase there is no cancellation in the computation of m2A , and thus we expect mA to be large,\nas shown in Fig. 1.\nIn Fig. 3, we show how different sparticle masses vary with m\u03c6 for the same parameter\nchoices as in Fig. 1. Most sparticle masses are relatively invariant to changes in m\u03c6 . One\n<\nf1 and Z\ne1,2 masses, which become small when \u03bc \u223c\ne1\nexception occurs for the W\nM2 , and the Z\n\nbecomes increasingly higgsino-like. The other exception occurs for the t\u03031,2 and b\u03031,2 masses.\nIn this case, the Q3 \u2261 (t\u0303L , b\u0303L ) and t\u0303R running masses also depend on terms including ft2 Xt .\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fsparticle masses (GeV)\n\nm0 =300GeV, m1/2 =300GeV, tan\u03b2=10, A0 =0, \u03bc >0, mt =178GeV\n\n~\nt2\n\n800\n\n~\n\n~\n\ng\n\nd\n~L\nu\n~L ~\nu\n~ R,dR\nb2\n\n700\n\n~\n\nb1\n600\n~\nt1\n\n500\n\n~\n\n\u03c4\n~2\neL\n\n400\n\n~\n\n~\n\n\u03bde,\u03bd\u03c4\n~\ne\n~R\n\u03c41\n\n300\n~\n\nw1\n200\n~\n\nz1\n100\n\n0\n-1000\n\n-800\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nm\u03c6 (GeV)\n\nFigure 3: Various sparticle masses versus m\u03c6 in the NUHM1 model for m0 = 300 GeV, m1/2 = 300\nGeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and mt = 178 GeV. We take \u03bc > 0.\n\nThus, when Xt is small (for m\u03c6 < m0 ), the diagonal entries in the top and bottom squark\nmass squared matrices are not as suppressed due to top Yukawa coupling effects as in the\nmSUGRA case. In contrast, for large positive values of m\u03c6 , Xt is large and these soft\nmasses are more suppressed resulting lighter third generation squarks. These expectations\nare indeed born out in Fig. 3.\n2.2 NUHM1 model: parameter space\nThe mSUGRA parameter space point we have used for illustration so far,\n(m0 , m1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2 = 300 GeV, 300 GeV, 0, 10)\nwith \u03bc > 0 and mt = 178 GeV, is excluded since \u03a9Ze1 h2 = 1.2. However, by extending the\nparameter space to include m\u03c6 as in the NUHM1 model, these parameter values are allowed\nfor an appropriate choice of m\u03c6 . As an example, in Fig. 4 we use m0 , m1/2 and A0 as in the\nmSUGRA parameter set above, and scan over tan \u03b2 and m\u03c6 values. In plotting points,\nwe construct a \u03c72 value out of the three quantities \u03a9Ze1 h2 , BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) and \u2206a\u03bc , where\nP\n2\ni)\n, where xi is the predicted value, \u03bci is the measured value, and \u03c3i is the\n\u03c72 = 3i=1 (xi \u2212\u03bc\n\u03c32\ni\n\nerror on the ith measured quantity. In constructing the \u03c72 value, we only use the WMAP\nupper bound (thus, points with \u03a9Ze1 h2 < 0.113 do not contribute to the \u03c72 ) to allow for the\npossibility of mixed cold dark matter, where for instance a portion of dark matter might\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fp\nFigure 4: Ranges of \u03c72 in a scan over tan \u03b2 and m\u03c6 values in the NUHM1 model for fixed\nm0 = m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, \u03bc > 0 and mt = 178 GeV. The green region corresponds to low\np >\np < \u221a\nvalues of \u03c72 \u223c 3, while the red region has \u03c72 \u223c 5, with the yellow region corresponding to\nintermediate values.\n\np <\u221a\nconsist of, say, axions1 . Green points have low \u03c72 \u223c 3 values, and agree\nwith the\np well\n>\n2\ncentral values of each of these measurements. Red p\npoints have large \u03c7 \u223c 5, and are\nexcluded. Yellow points have intermediate values of \u03c72 . We show six frames illustrating\nvarious correlations amongst parameters. In frame a) showing m\u03c6 vs. tan \u03b2, we see the\ngreen/yellow A-annihilation funnel for m\u03c6 \u223c \u22120.8 TeV, which occurs for every tan \u03b2 value.\nWe also see at m\u03c6 \u223c 0.6 TeV the appearance of the higgsino region, corresponding to the\nHB/FP region of the mSUGRA model. While the relic density is in accord with WMAP\nin this region, as tan \u03b2 increases, BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) and \u2206a\u03bc also increase, so that the higgsino\nregion becomes increasingly disfavored for large tan \u03b2. Frame b) shows the tan \u03b2 vs. \u03bc\ncorrelation, where we see that indeed \u03bc is small in the higgsino region, and large in the\nA-funnel. Frame c) shows the m\u03c6 vs. mA correlation, and indeed we see large values of\nmA in the higgsino region, while mA \u223c 250 GeV in the A-funnel. The remaining three\nframes show (2mZe1 \u2212 mA )/mA vs. tan \u03b2, m\u03c6 and \u03bc respectively, which explicitly displays\nthe A-annihilation funnel against the input parameters and \u03bc.\nAs we have already mentioned, there is still some debate on the range of the SM\nprediction for a\u03bc , as well as the MSSM prediction for BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3). As a result, the \u03c72\n1\n\nA low thermal relic abundance may also be compatible with a fully supersymmetric dark matter scenario\nprovided non-thermal production of neutralinos or cosmological enhancements of the thermal relic density\noccur: see Sec 2.3.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 5: Ranges of \u03a9h2 , \u03b4a\u03bc and BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) for the NUHM1 models scanned in Fig. 4. If a\nparameter point falls outside the ranges shown, it is not plotted in this figure.\n\nvalues in Fig. 4 should be interpreted with some care. To facilitate this, we show the ranges\nof \u03a9h2 , \u03b4a\u03bc and BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) for the same set of NUHM1 models as in Fig. 5. If a parameter\nset in Fig. 4 yields a value of these quantities that is outside the range shown, then the\npoint is not plotted. From this plot we see why only the low tan \u03b2 portion of the higgsino\nregion at low \u03bc gives low \u03c72 in Fig. 4: at high tan \u03b2, the BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) is quite high, while the\nvalue of \u2206a\u03bc is quite low. We see, however, a large swath of yellow with \u03a9CDM h2 < 0.094\nat large values of tan \u03b2 in the upper frames of Fig. 5. This occurs because the A and\nH bosons become light and relatively wide, leading to a resonant enhancement (even off\nresonance) in the neutralino annihilation cross section and a corresponding reduction in\nthe relic density. In this case, there must then be some other new physics that brings the\nCDM density up to the WMAP value2 .\n2\n\nWe note that it is possible that this new physics associated with the non-LSP components of dark\nmatter may also yield (possibly non-calculable) new contributions to both \u03b4a\u03bc and BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3), so that\nit may be premature to unequivocally exclude this parameter space region at large values of tan \u03b2 because\nthese quantities are not in agreement with their measured values.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fp\nFigure 6: The \u03c72 value in the m0 vs. m1/2 plane for A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0 and mt =\n178 GeV.

The\nblue region is excluded by LEP2.\n\nIn Fig. 6, we show the m0 vs. m1/2 parameter space plane for the NUHM1 model,\nwith A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0, mt = 178 GeV and a) m\u03c6 = 0 (mSUGRA case), b),\nm\u03c6 = \u22122.5m0 , m\u03c6 = 1.1m0 and m\u03c6 = 1.5m0 . The black regions are excluded by lack of\nREWSB (right hand side) and because the stau is the LSP on the left hand side. The blue\nshaded region is excluded by the LEP2 constraint that mW\nf1 < 103.5 GeV. The remaining\np\nparameter space is color coded according to the \u03c72 value, and indeed we see that most\nof parameter space is excluded. The mSUGRA case of frame a) shows the HB/FP region\nat m0 \u223c 8 \u2212 10 TeV, while the stau co-annihilation is squeezed against the left edge of\nthe allowed parameter space. In frame b) for a large negative value of m\u03c6 , we see that a\nnarrow allowed region now cuts through the middle of the parameter plane. This is the\nA-annihilation funnel, which is much narrower than in the mSUGRA case at large tan \u03b2,\nsince now the A-width is relatively small: typically \u223c 1 GeV. Note that the range of m0\nextends only to 2 TeV, since for larger values of m0 , m2A < 0 and REWSB is violated.

Since the detection rates critically depend on the dark matter halo profile of our own\ngalaxy, and a wealth of observational data and theoretical constraints are available,\nthe halo models one resorts to must be consistent with all information we have about\nthe Milky Way. Moreover, since different detection techniques rely on the local dark\nmatter density distribution and on the velocity distribution, a fair comparison among\nthem may be carried out only provided the two distributions are self-consistently\ncomputed, not only locally, but throughout the whole halo3 .\n2. A comparison of the various techniques must rely on quantities which provide information on the relative strength of the expected signal with respect to the projected\nexperimental sensitivity, taking into account the background. Toward this end, we\nuse what have been dubbed Visibility Ratios (VR) [44, 45, 46, 25], which will be\ndefined below for each experiment. A VR is simply a signal-to-sensitivity ratio: when\nVR>1, the signal calculated using a specified model is expected to be detectable over\nbackgrounds with the particular experimental setup; in case VR<1, the signal will\nlie below the sensitivity of the considered detection facility. The locus of points at\nVR=1 outlines the actual reach contour of any particular detection technique. The\nrelative magnitudes of the VR's for different dark matter search experiments provides\na direct comparison between them[47].\nAs far as item 1. is concerned, we follow here the strategy outlined in Ref. [44] (the\nreader is referred to Ref. [48, 49, 45] for more details). Motivated by N-body simulations\nof hierarchical clustering in dark matter cosmologies, the starting point is to take into\naccount the correlation between the virial mass of a given galaxy Mvir and its concentration\nparameter cvir [50], and then to provide a description of the dynamics of the baryon infall\nand of its back-reaction onto the dark halo. Two extreme regimes have been outlined, the\nfirst one being motivated by a large angular momentum transfer between dark matter and\nbaryons, while the second one by supposing that baryons settled in with no net transfer of\nangular momentum to the dark component.\nIn the first scenario, the central cusp in the dark matter halo, as seen in numerical\nsimulations, is smoothed out by a significant heating of the cold particles [51], leading to\na cored density distribution, which has been modeled by the so called Burkert profile [52],\n\u03c1B (r) =\n\n\u03c10B\n.\n(1 + r/a) (1 + (r/a)2 )\n\n3\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe recall that, while the gamma ray flux from the galactic center only depends on the dark matter\ndensity in a very small, and poorly known region, the antimatter rates vary with the dark matter density\nin a more extended portion of the halo; finally the flux of neutrinos from neutralino annihilations in the\nsun and the direct detection rates essentially depend only on the density and velocity distributions of the\ndark halo within the solar system.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fHere, the length scale parameter has been set to a = 11.7 kpc, while the normalization\n\u03c10B is adjusted to reproduce the local halo density at the Earth position to \u03c1B (r0 ) =\n0.34 GeV cm\u22123 [48]. We refer to this model as to the Burkert Halo Model. It has been\nsuccessfully tested against a large sample of rotation curves of spiral galaxies [53].\nIn the second scenario that we consider, baryon infall causes a progressive deepening\nof the gravitational potential well at the center of the galaxy, resulting in increasingly\nhigher concentration of dark matter particles. In the circular orbit approximation [54,\n55], this adiabatic contraction limit has been worked out starting from the N03 profile\nproposed in Ref. [56]; the resulting spherical profile, which has no closed analytical form,\nroughly follows, in the inner galactic regions, the behavior of the profile proposed by Moore\net al.,[57], approximately scaling as r \u22121.5 in the innermost regions, and features a local\ndark matter density \u03c1N 03 (r0 ) = 0.38 GeV cm\u22123 . We dub this setup as the Adiabatically\nContracted N03 Halo Model.\nThe parameters for both models have been chosen to reproduce a variety of dynamical\ninformation, ranging from the constraints stemming from the motion of stars in the sun's\nneighborhood, total mass estimates from the motion of the outer satellites, and consistency\nwith the Milky Way rotation curve and measures of the optical depth toward the galactic\nbulge [48, 49]. Finally, the local velocity distributions of the two spherical profiles have\nbeen self-consistently computed using the formalism outlined in Ref. [58], thus allowing for\na reliable comparison between direct and indirect detection techniques. Both models have\nbeen included in the latest public release of the DarkSUSY package [24].\nTurning to item 2., we begin by defining the Visibility Ratios (VR) mentioned above\nfor each dark matter detection technique. For direct dark matter detection, in view of\nthe fact that spin-dependent searches have been shown to be sensitive to scattering cross\nsections typically much larger than those predicted within the MSSM [45], we focus here\nonly on spin-independent (SI) searches. The relevant quantity is the neutralino-proton\nSI scattering cross section, \u03c3 SI\ne . The VR is simply defined as the ratio between the\nexpected \u03c3 SI\ne\n\nZ1 p\n\nZ1 p\n\nfrom a given supersymmetric model and the corresponding experimental\n\nSI at the given neutralino mass, for the particular dark matter halo profile\nsensitivity \u03c3exp\nunder consideration, taking into account the corresponding self-consistently computed local\nvelocity distribution.4 We consider here two benchmark direct detection experiments,\nnamely CDMS-II [59] (stage-2 detectors) and the proposed XENON 1-ton facility (stage-3\ndetectors) [60, 61].\nTo assess the sensitivity of a km2 -size detector such as IceCube designed to detect\nhigh energy muons, we compute the expected muon flux from neutralino annihilations in\nthe sun5 above a threshold of 1 GeV. The low threshold was chosen to allow a comparison\nof the expected muon flux with the existing upper limits from the SuperKamiokande ex4\n\nThe sensitivity of direct detection experiments may vary over more than two orders of magnitude for\nthe typical range of neutralino masses in the MSSM. It also depends (less strongly) on the halo profile. In\nSI\nview of this sensitivity, we must be careful to use the corresponding value of \u03c3exp\n(mZe 1 ) in the computation\nof the VR.\n5\nWe also evaluated the muon flux from the Earth, but always found far smaller fluxes than those expected\nfrom the sun.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fperiment (which indeed has a much lower energy threshold than IceCube) and to ensure\nthat the model is not already excluded. The predicted muon flux is then compared with\nthe sensitivity of IceCube. Since this detector has a higher energy threshold \u223c 50 GeV,\nwe corrected for the threshold mismatch using the corresponding projected sensitivities\nworked out in Ref. [63]. We have checked that the projected maximal sensitivity to the\nmuon flux obtained using this procedure is in good agreement with that obtained by integrating above the actual IceCube threshold. We also incorporated the dependence of\nthe sensitivity on the soft (e.g. from neutralino annihilation to bb\u0304) and hard (e.g. from\nannihilation to W + W \u2212 , Z 0 Z 0 and tt\u0304) neutrino spectra- the sensitivity being smaller in\nthe case of the softer spectrum.\nTurning to antimatter experiments, we compute the solar-modulated positron, antiproton and antideuteron fluxes, following the procedure outlined in Ref. [44]. We calculate\nthe neutralino annihilation rates to p\u0304 and n\u0304 using the Pythia 6.154 Monte Carlo code [64]\nas implemented in DarkSUSY [24], and then deduce the D yield using the prescription suggested in Ref. [65]. The propagation of charged cosmic rays through the galactic magnetic\nfields is worked out through an effective two-dimensional diffusion model in the steady\nstate approximation, while solar modulation effects were implemented through the analytical force-field approximation of Gleeson and Axford [66]. The solar modulation parameter\n\u03a6F is computed from the proton cosmic-ray fluxes, and assumed to be charge-independent.\nThe values of \u03a6F we use for antiprotons and positrons refer to a putative average of the\nsolar activity over the three years of data taking of the PAMELA experiment [67], which\nwill be the first space-based experiment for antimatter searches.\nFor antideuterons we consider the reach of the proposed gaseous antiparticle spectrometer (GAPS) [68] proposed to be placed on a satellite orbiting around the Earth, and tuned\nto look for antideuterons in the very low kinetic energy interval from 0.1 to 0.4 GeV [68, 69].\nIn this energy interval, the estimated background is strongly suppressed [65, 70], and unambiguous evidence of even a single low energy antideuteron could be regarded as a positive\nsearch result. Since the experiment is expected to be launched close to the maximum of\nthe solar cycle, we set the value of the solar modulation parameter \u03a6F at the corresponding value. The resulting sensitivity of GAPS has been determined to be of the level of\n2.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 m\u22122 sr\u22121 GeV\u22121 s\u22121 [68]. The VR for antideuterons will then be given by the\nintegrated D flux over the kinetic energy interval 0.1 < TD < 0.4 GeV, divided by the\nGAPS sensitivity. In other words, the VR will give, in this case, the actual number of\nantideuterons expected to be detected by GAPS.\nRegarding antiproton and positron fluxes, it was realized long ago that the low energy\ntails are considerably modified by solar modulation effects and, in the case of antiprotons,\nalso by large secondary and tertiary backgrounds [71], so that low energy positrons and\nantiprotons cannot provide a clean test for new physics contributions. However, in view\nof the fact that novel space-based experiments will be able to extend the experimental\nsensitivity to these to the hundreds of GeV range, the best place to look for an antimatter\nsignal from neutralino annihilations lies at the high energy end. Moreover, a distinctive\nsignature is provided by the clean cutoff of the neutralino-induced antimatter flux corresponding to energies equal to the neutralino mass, provided this flux is large enough to\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fbe detectable. Nevertheless, in general, the energy spectra of antiparticles generally look\nquite featureless: aside from the fact that the antiparticles from neutralino annihilation\nsit on top of a featureless background, solar modulation and propagation effects also tend\nto wash away any features inherent to the spectrum. With some obvious exceptions, the\nantiparticle energy (or rather E/mZe1 ) where the signal-to-background ratio is largest, is\nsensitive to the composition of the neutralino [72, 47]. Restricting attention to particular\nenergy bin(s) may also be misleading because of large uncertainties from secondary and\ntertiary p\u0304. A possible exception may be that of neutralinos mainly annihilating into gauge\nbosons, in which case one expects a bump in the positron spectrum at approximately half\nthe neutralino mass [73]; this could be especially relevant for neutralinos in the HB/FP\nregion.\nTo circumvent these problems, we adopt the statistical treatment of the antimatter\nyields introduced in Ref. [44] (an analogous approach has been proposed for cosmic positron\nsearches [74]). Motivated by the fact that the signal is much smaller than the background,\nwe introduce a quantity which weighs its \"statistical significance, summed over the energy\nbins\",\nZ Tmax\n(\u03c6s (E))2\nI\u03c6 =\ndE,\n(2.13)\n\u03c6b (E)\nTmin\nwhere \u03c6s (E) and \u03c6b (E) respectively represent the antimatter differential fluxes from neutralino annihilations and from the background at antiparticles' kinetic energy E, and\nTmin, max correspond to the antiparticle's maximal and minimal kinetic energies to which\ne+ = 50\na given experiment is sensitive (in the case of the PAMELA experiment [67], Tmin\np\u0304\ne+ = 270 GeV, T p\u0304\nMeV, Tmax\nmin = 80 MeV and Tmax = 190 GeV). We compute the primary\ncomponent, \u03c6s , with the DarkSUSY package, interfaced with a subroutine implementing the\ndiffusion and solar modulation models outlined above. The background flux \u03c6b has been\ncalculated with the Galprop package [75], with the same parameter choices employed to\ncompute the signal.\nGiven an experimental facility with a geometrical factor (acceptance) A and a total\ndata-taking time T , it has been shown [44] that, in the limit of a large number of energy\nbins and of high precision secondary (i.e. background) flux determination, a SUSY model\ngiving a primary antimatter flux \u03c6s can be discriminated at the 95% C.L. if\nI\u03c6 (\u03c6s ) * A * T > (\u03c72 )95%\nnb ,\n\n(2.14)\n\n2\nwhere (\u03c72 )95%\nnb stands for the 95% C.L. \u03c7 with nb degrees of freedom. For the PAMELA\nexperiment, where A = 24.5 cm2 sr, T =3 years and nb \u2243 60 we get the following discrimination condition [44]\n\nI\u03c6 (\u03c6s ) >\n\n(\u03c72 )95%\nnb\n\u2261 I\u03c63y,\nA*T\n\nPAMELA, 95%\n\n\u2243 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich is approximately valid for both positrons and antiprotons (though in the latter case\nthe PAMELA experiment is expected to do slightly better). As a rule of thumb, the\nanalogous quantity for AMS-02 should improve at least by one order of magnitude [73].\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fWe therefore define as VR for antiprotons and for positrons the ratio\n+\n\n+\n\n(VR)p\u0304,e \u2261 I\u03c6p\u0304,e /I\u03c63y,\n\nPAMELA, 95%\n\n.\n\n(2.16)\n\nFinally, the case for the gamma ray flux from the galactic center is plagued by large\nuncertainties on the very central structure of the Milky Way dark halo. Depending on\nvarious assumptions on the galactic models and on the physical cut-off in the inner part\nof our galaxy, there might be a spread of various orders of magnitude in the computation\nof the actual gamma-ray flux[76, 26]. This may be written as a product of a purely\nastrophysical quantity describing the propagation of the photons to the detector, and of\na purely particle-physics quantity h\u03c3vi [77] describing the source of these photons. The\nformer reads,\nZ\n1\nhJ(0)i(\u2206\u03a9) =\nJ(\u03c8)d\u03a9,\n(2.17)\n\u2206\u03a9 \u2206\u03a9\nwhere\n1\n*\nJ(\u03c8) =\n8.5 kpc\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0.3 GeV/cm3\n\n\u00132 Z\n\n\u03c12 (l)dl(\u03c8).\n\n(2.18)\n\nline of sight\n\nThe attitude we take here is just to extrapolate the halo models we use in the \u03c1(r \u2192 0)\nlimit, and to compute the corresponding hJ(0)i for the acceptance \u2206\u03a9 of GLAST. What\nwe find is hJ(0)i = 7.85 for the Burkert Halo Model, and hJ(0)i = 1.55 \u00d7 105 for the\nAdiabatically Contracted N03 Halo Model.6 We then compute the integrated gamma\nray flux above a 1 GeV threshold, \u03c6\u03b3 , and define the corresponding VR as \u03c6\u03b3 /(1.5 \u00d7\n10\u221210 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), the latter being the corresponding estimated sensitivity of the GLAST\nsatellite [79].\n2.4 Dark matter detection: the NUHM1 model\nIn Fig. 8 and 9 we show the VR's for the various experiments that we detailed in Sec. 2.3,\nfor two representative mSUGRA parameter choices: we fix tan \u03b2 = 10, m0 = 300 GeV,\nm1/2 = 300 GeV in Fig. 8, and tan \u03b2 = 20, m0 = 1000 GeV, m1/2 = 200 GeV in Fig. 9\n(in both cases A0 = 0, sign(\u03bc) > 0 and mt = 178 GeV) and show the results as a function\nof m\u03c6 /m0 . The regions shaded in red are excluded by the LEP2 limits on the mass of\nthe pseudoscalar Higgs boson mA and on the mass of the lightest chargino. The green\nregions indicate, instead, parameter space regions where the neutralino relic abundance\n\u03a9Ze1 h2 < 0.13, consistently with the WMAP 95% C.L. upper limit on the Cold Dark\nMatter abundance [80]: agreement with the central value of WMAP is obtained close to\nthe boundary of this region. We remind the reader that a VR larger than unity means\nthat the signal should be detectable in the particular dark matter detection channel. For\ndefiniteness, we adopt the conservative Burkert Halo Model. The results we show should be\n6\n\nIn the case of the Adiabatically Contracted halo model, this procedure is quite arbitrary, since different\nhypotheses on the dynamics of the central black hole formation might lead to very different predictions for\nthe dark matter density in the center of the halo [55, 78]. Because there is an unconstrained extrapolation,\nessentially any flux may be possible.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fregarded as plausible lower limits, particularly as far as indirect rates are concerned since\na cuspy inner dark halo would greatly enhance the dark matter detection rates [44, 76].7\nWe see, in Fig. 8, that for all values of m\u03c6 the signal will be accessible to stage-3 direct\ndetection facilities, like XENON 1-ton [60], while stage-2 detectors (such as CDMS-II[59])\nwill be able to probe only the HB/FP region, at large m\u03c6 . The behavior of the direct\ndetection VR's is readily understood. On the one hand, when m\u03c6 takes large negative\nvalues, both mA and the CP -even heavy Higgs boson mass mH decrease; this leads to an\nenhancement of the t-channel H exchange in the neutralino-proton cross section (which\nscales as m\u22124\ne1 ). On the other hand, when m\u03c6 is large and\nH , assuming that mA,H \u226b mZ\nSI \u221d (Z Z )2 , where\npositive, the higgsino fraction increases, and so does \u03c3 SI\nh g\ne1 p\ne1 p since \u03c3Z\nZ\nZh,g respectively denote the higgsino and bino fraction in the lightest neutralino. The\nsame behavior for the direct detection VR applies to Fig. 9; here, once again, stage-3\ndetectors will be able to fully explore the parameter space, while only the focus point\nregion will be discoverable at stage-2 facilities.\nTurning to the neutralino-annihilations-induced flux of muons from the sun, we see\nthat in both figures the resonant annihilation region gives rates which will be various\norders of magnitude below the projected ultimate sensitivity of IceCube. This is because\nthe neutralino capture rate in the sun (which mainly depends on the neutralino-proton spindependent scattering cross section) is not large enough: in contrast to the spin-independent\ncross section, in fact, the main contribution to the spin-dependent one comes from the Z\nexchange diagram, which is not enhanced by the smaller values of mH,A . On the other\nhand, a larger higgsino fraction and annihilation cross section yields detectable rates at\nneutrino telescopes for the model considered in Fig. 8, at large m\u03c6 ; for the case addressed\nin Fig. 9 we see that the expected rates only lie less than one order of magnitude below\nthe maximal sensitivity of IceCube. This is because for the smaller value of m1/2 , the\nneutralino LSP does not acquire a sufficiently large higgsino component all the way to the\nLEP2 limit.\nAs far as other indirect detection techniques are concerned, though we are here considering the conservative cored dark matter profile, the large neutralino pair annihilation\nrate h\u03c3vi0 in the funnel region yields very large rates in all channels, peaked on the value\nof m\u03c6 at which mA \u2243 2mZe1 . A considerable enhancement is also seen in the HB/FP region. Despite this enhancement, antimatter detection rates might not be large enough to\nbe discriminated against the background, especially in the case that we study in Fig. 9.\nWe should mention that for ranges of parameters that yield a thermal dark matter\ndensity smaller than the WMAP central value we do not correspondingly scale down the\nresults in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, as we would have to for any model where the remainder of the\ndark matter was composed of something other than the SUSY LSP (see e.g. Ref. [81] and\nreferences therein). In this case, possible additional contributions from these other dark\nmatter components would have to be included. We work here, instead, under the hypothesis\nthat even within the low thermal relic density parameter ranges, the LSP is all of the dark\nmatter, but that there is either additional non-thermal production [82], or cosmological relic\n7\n\nThis is explicitly illustrated for the NUHM2 Model in the next Section.\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\f10\n\nVisibility Ratios\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\na2)\n\na2)\n\n-1\n\na1)\n\nc)\n\n10\n\na1)\nc)\nb)\nf)\n\nf)\n-3\n\n10\n10\n10\n\nb)\n\n-4\n\ne)\n\n-5\n\n10 -3\n\n10\n\nVisibility Threshold\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n-2.75\n\n-2.5\n\nd)\n\nd)\n-2\n\n-2.25\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\nm\u03c6/m0\n\ne)\n\n10\n1.75\n\n2 10\n\n3\n2\n\ntan\u03b2=10, \u03bc>0, A0=0, m0=300 GeV\n\n1\n\nm1/2=300 GeV, \u03bc>0, mtop=178 GeV\nLEP2 excluded\n\n0\n-1\n\na1)\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n\na2)\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\nf)\n\n2\n\n\u03a9h <0.13\n\n~\nDirect Detection, Z1p SI, on CDMS-II\n~\nDirect Detection, Z1p SI, on XENON\nMuons f/Sun, on IceCube\nAntideuterons, on GAPS/Earth\nAntiprotons, on PAMELA/3-y\nPositrons, on PAMELA/3-y\nGamma Rays f/GC, on GLAST\n\nm\u03c6/m0\n\nFigure 8: Dark matter detection Visibility Ratios (i.e. signal-to-projected-sensitivity ratios) for\nvarious direct and indirect techniques, as a function of the GUT scale non-universal Higgs mass\nparameter m\u03c6 , for mSUGRA parameters tan \u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0, sgn\u03bc > 0, m0 = 300 GeV, m1/2 = 300\nGeV, and setting mt = 178 GeV.

Collider expectations within the NUHM1 framework can differ from\ncorresponding expectations within the well-studied mSUGRA model. In the following dis-\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fcussion, we highlight these differences confining our discussion to NUHM1 model parameter\nsets that satisfy the WMAP bound on \u03a9Ze1 h2 .\n2.5.1 Fermilab Tevatron\n\nThe most promising avenue for a supersymmetry discovery at the Fermilab Tevatron in the\ncase of gravity-mediated SUSY breaking models with gaugino mass unification is by the\nf1 Z\ne2 X followed by W\nf1 \u2192 l\u03bdl Ze1 and Ze2 \u2192 ll\u0304Z\ne1\nobservation of trilepton signals from pp\u0304 \u2192 W\n\nthree body decays, where l = e or \u03bc [89, 90]. In the case of the NUHM1 model where m\u03c6 is\ntaken to have negative values so that neutralinos annihilate via the A and H poles, the only\neffect on the gaugino/higgsino sector is that the magnitude of the \u03bc parameter increases.\nAs a result, the HB/FP region of small |\u03bc| is absent in frame b) of Fig. 10, so that unlike\nthe case of mSUGRA [90], probing large values of m0 and m1/2 via this channel will not be\npossible. Alternatively, if m\u03c6 is taken to be large compared to m0 so that |\u03bc| is small, then\nchargino and neutralino masses can become lighter, which may increase production cross\nsections. Furthermore, the mZe2 \u2212 mZe1 mass gap will diminish, which can close \"spoiler\"\ne2 \u2192 Ze1 h, so that the necessary three-body neutralino decays are\ndecay modes such as Z\nmore likely to be in effect, and because tan \u03b2 is not necessarily large, we do not expect\nevents with tau leptons to dominate at the expense of e and \u03bc events. Thus, in the large\nm\u03c6 region, we expect improved prospects for clean trilepton signals. Detailed simulation\nwould of course be necessary to draw definitive conclusions.\n2.5.2 CERN LHC\n\u221a\nThe CERN LHC is expected to begin operation in 2007 with pp collisions at s = 14 TeV.\nIn most regions of parameter space of gravity-mediated SUSY breaking models, gluino and\nsquark pair production is expected to be the dominant source of sparticles at the LHC.\nSince the values of m0 and m1/2 determine for the most part the magnitudes of the squark\nand gluino masses, we expect sparticle production rates in the NUHM1 model to be similar\nto those in the mSUGRA model for the same model parameter choices. The reach of the\nCERN LHC in the case of the mSUGRA model has recently been re-evaluated in the\nm0 vs. m1/2 plane for various tan \u03b2 values, and assuming 100 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity\nin Ref. [91]. We display this reach contour on frame a) of Fig. 10 where as in Fig. 6a)\nwe take A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and m\u03c6 = m0 (mSUGRA case). We also show the WMAP\nallowed region (\u03a9Ze1 h2 < 0.13) as the one shaded in green. The low m0 portion of the\nreach contour extends to m1/2 \u223c 1.3 TeV, and corresponds roughly to mq\u0303 \u223c mg\u0303 \u223c 3 TeV.\nThe high m0 portion of the reach contour extends to m1/2 \u223c 0.7 TeV, and corresponds to\nmg\u0303 \u223c 1.8 TeV, while squarks are in the multi-TeV range, and essentially decoupled. Note\nthat in this frame the parameter m0 ranges all the way to 10 TeV.\nIn frame b), with m\u03c6 = \u22122.5m0 , a much smaller range of m0 is allowed, and the plot\nonly extends to m0 = 2 TeV. Since the reach is mainly determined by the values of the\nsquark and gluino masses, we adapt the reach contours from Ref. [91] to this non-mSUGRA\ncase. Here, it is seen that the LHC reach covers almost all of the allowed A annihilation\nfunnel. In frames c) and d), we show the cases for m\u03c6 = 1.1m0 and 1.5m0 , respectively.\nHere, the HB/FP type region re-emerges, but at much lower m0 values, as discussed in\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fSec. 2.2.

The regions shaded in green are consistent with the WMAP\nconstraint \u03a9h2 < 0.13, while those shaded in red and blue are respectively excluded by theoretical\nand experimental constraints discussed in the text.\n\nWhile we expect a similar reach of the LHC (in terms of mq\u0303 and mg\u0303 parameters) to be\nfound in both the mSUGRA and NUHM1 models, the detailed gluino and squark cascade\ndecays will change, as will the expected SUSY Higgs signals. To exemplify this, we list\nin Table 1 three model points. The first corresponds to mSUGRA for m0 = m1/2 = 300\nGeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0 and mt = 178 GeV. We list a variety of sparticle and\nHiggs boson masses, along with \u03a9Ze1 h2 , BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) and \u2206a\u03bc . The second and third points\nlisted, NUHM1a and NUHM1b, correspond to the same mSUGRA model parameters, but\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fwith m\u03c6 = \u2212735 GeV and 550 GeV, respectively. The mSUGRA case can be seen to have\n\u03a9Ze1 h2 = 1.2, and is thus strongly excluded by WMAP data, while the two NUHM1 points\nhave \u03a9Ze1 h2 \u223c 0.11, and give the correct amount of CDM in the universe. The NUHM1a\npoint has a similar spectrum of sparticles compared to the mSUGRA case, although the\nheavier chargino and neutralinos have increased masses due to the larger value of the \u03bc\nparameter. The main difference is that the heavier Higgs bosons are relatively light in\nthe NUHM1a case, and can be accessible to LHC searches as well as at a TeV-scale linear\ncollider. In the case of mSUGRA, only the lightest Higgs h will be detectable at the LHC\nvia direct h production followed by h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay, or via tt\u0304h or W h production, followed\nby h \u2192 bb\u0304 decay. The h should also be observable in the sparticle cascade decays [93]. In\nthe NUHM1a case with mA = 265 GeV, the H and A Higgs bosons are much lighter, and\nshould be detectable via direct H and A production followed by H, A \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 decay [92].\nThe reaction gb \u2192 tH + followed by H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 appears to be on the edge of observability.\nIf tan \u03b2 is increased to values beyond 15, then H, A \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 [94] should become visible.\nparameter\nm\u03c6\n\u03bc\nmg\u0303\nm\u0169L\nmt\u03031\nmb\u03031\nm\u1ebdL\nm\u1ebdR\nmW\nf2\nmW\nf1\nmZe4\nmZe3\nmZe2\nmZe1\nmA\nmH +\nmh\n\u03a9Ze1 h2\nBF (b \u2192 s\u03b3)\n\u2206a\u03bc\n\nmSUGRA\n300\n409.2\n732.9\n720.9\n523.4\n650.0\n364.7\n322.8\n432.9\n223.9\n433.7\n414.8\n223.7\n117.0\n538.6\n548.0\n115.7\n1.2\n3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124\n12.1 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\nNUHM1a\n-735\n754.0\n736.2\n720.5\n632.4\n691.6\n366.4\n322.1\n759.6\n236.2\n759.5\n752.0\n235.8\n118.7\n265.0\n278.2\n116.1\n0.12\n4.7 \u00d7 10\u22124\n9.4 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\nNUHM1b\n550\n180.6\n732.0\n722.4\n481.0\n631.0\n364.5\n323.0\n280.3\n150.2\n283.4\n190.3\n160.7\n102.7\n603.8\n613.0\n115.3\n0.11\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n17.4 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\nTable 1: Masses and parameters in GeV units for mSUGRA and two NUHM1 models, where\nm0 = m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and mt = 178 GeV.\n\nIn the case of NUHM1b, m\u03c6 is taken large enough that \u03bc becomes small, 180.6 GeV,\nand the lightest neutralino develops a sufficient higgsino component to respect the WMAP\ndark matter constraint. The low \u03bc value pulls the various heavier chargino and neutralino\nmasses to low values ranging from 190 \u2212 283 GeV. In this case, gluinos and squarks will be\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fcopiously produced at the LHC. Gluinos dominantly decay via two body modes to t\u03031 t (BF \u2243\nf1,2 (53%), t\u03031 \u2192 tZ\ne3 (25%),\n49%) and b\u03031,2 b (BF \u2243 39%). The lighter stop decays via t\u03031 \u2192 bW\nwhile b\u03031 (b\u03032 ) mainly decays to the two charginos (roughly democratically to all charginos and\nneutralinos). The left squarks decay mainly to both charginos and to Ze1,2 , while q\u0303R mainly\ndecays via q\u0303R \u2192 Ze1,2 . The lighter chargino decays via three body decays with branching\nfractions corresponding to those of the virtual W . On the other hand, Ze2,3 decays via\ne2(3) \u2192 ll\u0304Ze1 ) \u2243 1.5(3)% per\nthree body decays with the leptonic branching fraction BF (Z\nf2 \u2192 W Z\ne2 , W\nf1 Z, while\nlepton family. Finally the heavier chargino mainly decays via W\nf1 W . It is clear that the LHC will be awash in SUSY events, with gluino and\nZe4 \u2192 W\nsquark production being the dominant production mechanism. In this scenario, the total\nSUSY cross section is almost 104 fb, so that even at the low luminosity, we should expect\n\u223c 100, 000 SUSY events annually. Moreover, from our discussion of the sparticle decay\npatterns, we see that all the charginos and neutralinos should be accessible via cascade\ndecays of gluinos and squarks, as envisioned in Ref. [95]. It would be extremely interesting\nto perform a detailed study of just how much information about the SUSY spectrum the\nLHC data would be able to provide in this case. While detailed simulation would be\nnecessary before definitive statements can be made, it is plausible that analyses along the\nlines carried out in Ref. [96] may yield information about a large part of the sparticle\nspectrum, and provide a real connection between collider experiments and dark matter\nsearches.\n2.5.3 Linear e+ e\u2212 collider\n\u221a\nThe reach of a s = 0.5 and 1 TeV international linear e+ e\u2212 collider (ILC) for supersymmetry has been evaluated with special attention on the HB/FP region in Ref. [97] in\nthe case of the mSUGRA model. In this study it was shown that the reach contours in\nthe m0 vs. m1/2 plane are determined mainly via the reach for sleptons pairs, the reach\ne2 production. There is also a significant\nfor chargino pairs, and partly by the reach in Ze1 Z\nreach for the Higgs bosons H, A and H + in the large tan \u03b2 case. The striking result of\nRef. [97] was that in the WMAP allowed HB/FP region, |\u03bc| becomes small and charginos\nbecome light, the reach of the ILC extends beyond that of the LHC. In the HB/FP region\nof the mSUGRA model, squarks are in the multi-TeV regime, and effectively not produced\n>\nat the LHC. The signal at the LHC becomes rate limited for mg\u0303 \u223c 1.8 TeV.\nIn Fig. 10, we also show contours of mW\nf1 and min(m\u1ebdL ,\u1ebdR ) = 250 GeV and 500 GeV:\nsince signals from chargino and selectron pairs can be probed at an e+ e\u2212 linear collider\nnearly up to the kinematic limit for their production, these contours follow the boundary of\nthe region that would be probed at the ILC. Frame a) shows the mSUGRA case where an\nILC would have an extended reach in the HB/FP region around m0 \u223c 8 \u2212 10 TeV. In frame\nb) where the DM-allowed regions consist only of the A-funnel and stau-co-annihilation\ncorridor, the ILC reach is well below that of the LHC. In frames c) and d), where m\u03c6 > m0 ,\nthe HB/FP region has moved to much lower values of m0 . However, in these regions, again\nf +W\nf \u2212 pairs may\n\u03bc becomes small so that charginos become light, and the ILC reach for W\n1\n1\nexceed the reach of the LHC along the right-hand edge of parameter space, even in frame\nd) where squarks are comparatively light.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fConcerning the specific SUSY models shown in Table 1, in the case of the mSUGRA\n\u221a\nmodel, the ILC operating at s = 500 GeV would see of course Zh production, but also\nf+W\nf \u2212 and Z\ne1 Ze2 production. The cross section for the latter process is \u223c 200 fb, and\nW\n1\n1\nsince Ze2 \u2192 Ze1 Z 0 essentially all the time, the end points of the energy distribution of Z 0\ne1 and Ze2 masses to good precision. This is, of course, over\nshould yield the values of Z\nand above mW\nf1 which can be determined as usual. In the NUHM1a model, where now the\nMSSM Higgs sector becomes light, H 0 Z 0 and A0 h production will also be possible, allowing\na detailed study of the Higgs sector and possibly a good determination of tan \u03b2 [98]. If the\nILC energy is increased somewhat above 500 GeV, then H + H \u2212 also becomes accessible\nto study. For the NUHM1b model, the Higgs bosons again become heavy, but the various\ne3 , Ze1 Ze4 ,\nheavier charginos and neutralinos become light. In this case, the final states Ze1 Z\n\u00b1\n\u2213\ne2 Ze3 , Z\ne2 Ze4 and even Z\ne3 Ze4 as well as W\nf W\nf are kinematically accessible. Thus,\nZe2 Ze2 , Z\n1\n2\na whole host of heavier chargino/neutralino states would be available for study. If the\nILC energy is increased to 1 TeV, then as in the mSUGRA case, the various slepton\nf1 W\nf2 pair production would be available for study and SUSY\npair production as well as W\nspectroscopy would become a reality. Moreover, the heavier Higgs bosons A, H and H \u00b1\nwhich now have substantial branching fractions to charginos and neutralinos, will also be\naccessible to study.\n\n3. NUHM2 model\n3.1 Overview\nThe NUHM2 model is characterized by two additional parameters beyond the mSUGRA\nset. The two new parameters may be taken to be the GUT scale values of m2Hu and\nm2Hd , where these parameters may take on both positive and negative values. The model\nparameter space is given by\nm0 , m2Hu , m2Hd , m1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2, sign(\u03bc) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe remind the reader that at tree level the Higgs scalar potential is completely specified\nby m2Hu , m2Hd , \u03bc2 and the parameter B\u03bc. The two minimization conditions allow us to\ntrade two of m2Hu , m2Hd , \u03bc2 and B\u03bc in favor of tan\u03b2 and MZ2 , while a third may be traded\nfor the CP odd Higgs scalar mass mA . In (3.1) above, \u03bc2 and B\u03bc have been traded for\ntan \u03b2 and MZ2 , leaving the sign of \u03bc (which enters via the chargino and neutralino mass\nmatrices) undetermined. Alternatively, in the NUHM2 model, we could have eliminated\nm2Hu , m2Hd and B\u03bc leaving tan \u03b2 together with the weak scale values of \u03bc and mA as input\nparameters. Thus, the set\nm0 , \u03bc, mA , m1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03bc, mA and tan \u03b2 are input as weak scale values, while the remaining parameters\nare GUT scale values, provides an alternative parametrization of the NUHM2 model. In\nmSUGRA, we have two additional constraints, m2Hu = m2Hd = m20 , on the scalar potential\nand the values of \u03bc2 and mA are determined.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fWe have upgraded Isajet v7.72 to allow not only the input of negative Higgs squared\nmasses at the GUT scale, but also to accommodate the second of these parameter sets with\nweak scale values of \u03bc and mA as inputs, using the non-universal SUGRA (NUSUG) input\nparameters [23]. The NUHM1 and NUHM2 models in Isajet incorporate REWSB using the\n\u221a\nRG improved one-loop effective potential, minimized at an optimal scale Q = mt\u0303L mt\u0303R\nto account for dominant two-loop contributions.\nAn important aspect of the NUHM2 model is that RG running of soft masses is in\ngeneral modified by the presence of a non-zero S term in Eq. (2.8). The quantity S, which\nin the NUHM2 model is given by S = m2Hu \u2212 m2Hd , enters the third generation soft scalar\nsquared mass RGEs as,\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndm2Q3\n2\n16 2 2\n1 2\n1 2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nX\n=\ng\nM\n\u2212\n3g\nM\n\u2212\ng\nM\n+\ng\nS\n+\nf\nX\n+\nf\n\u2212\n2 2\nt t\nb b ,\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n15 1 1\n3 3 3 10 1\n(3.3)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\ndmt\u0303\n2\n16\n2\n16\nR\n=\n\u2212 g12 M12 \u2212 g32 M32 \u2212 g12 S + 2ft2 Xt ,\n(3.4)\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n15\n3\n5\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndm2b\u0303\n2\n4 2 2 16 2 2 1 2\n2\nR\n(3.5)\n=\n\u2212 g1 M1 \u2212 g3 M3 + g1 S + 2fb Xb ,\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n15\n3\n5\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndm2L3\n2\n3 2\n3 2 2\n2\n2\n2\n=\n\u2212 g1 M1 \u2212 3g2 M2 \u2212 g1 S + f\u03c4 X\u03c4 ,\n(3.6)\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n5\n10\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndm2\u03c4\u0303R\n2\n12 2 2 3 2\n2\n=\n\u2212 g1 M1 + g1 S + 2f\u03c4 X\u03c4 .\n(3.7)\ndt\n16\u03c0 2\n5\n5\nThe first and second generation soft mass RGEs are similar, but with negligible Yukawa\ncoupling contributions. The Higgs boson soft mass RGEs are as given by (2.3) and (2.4).\nThe coefficients of the S terms are all proportional to the weak hypercharge assignments,\nso that this term provides a source of intra-generational mass splitting. When S is large\nand positive (i.e., when m2Hu > m2Hd ), the mass parameters for \u03c4\u0303R , \u1ebdR and \u03bc\u0303R are the\nmost suppressed, while those for q\u0303R and l\u0303L are enhanced. If S is large and negative, the\nsituation is exactly reversed. For large values of |S|, the sfermion mass ordering as well as\nmixing patterns of third generation sfermions may be altered from mSUGRA expectations,\nor for that matter expectations in many other models of sparticle masses. For instance,\nit is possible that ml\u0303L < ml\u0303R ; moreover, while the lighter stau is usually expected to be\ndominantly \u03c4\u0303R in most models, this may no longer be the case in the NUHM2 model.\nAs a simple illustration of how the spectrum of the NUHM2 model varies with the\nHiggs boson mass parameters, in Fig.\nq 11 we show the physical\nq masses of various sparticles\n2\n2\n2\nversus \u2206mH \u2261 m0 \u2212 sign(mHu ) * |mHu | = sign(mHd ) * |m2Hd | \u2212 m0 . This is a one\n\nparameter section of the NUHM2 parameter space we call the Higgs splitting (HS) model,\nwith \u2206mH = 0 corresponding to the mSUGRA model. Large positive \u2206mH gives rise to\na large negative S, and vice versa. In our example, we take m0 = m1/2 = 300 GeV, with\nA0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0. As \u2206mH increases, we see that in the first generation,\nthe \u1ebdR , d \u0303R and \u0169L masses all increase, while \u1ebdL and \u0169R masses decrease. In mSUGRA,\nm\u1ebdR is always less than m\u1ebdL ; in NUHM2 models, this mass ordering may be reversed. At\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fthe highest allowed values of \u2206mH , the \u03bd\u0303\u03c4 and \u03c4\u03031 mass values become light (and \u03c4\u03031 is\nthen dominantly \u03c4\u0303L ), enhancing t-channel Ze1 Ze1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 , e+ e\u2212 , \u03bd\u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 annihilation\nin the early universe, which lowers the relic density to within the WMAP bound.

In frame a) we show the values of \u03bc, mA and mZe1 versus \u2206mH .

For \u2206mH large and positive, the relic density, shown in frame b),\ndrops because left sleptons and sneutrinos become very light. The value of BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3)\nand \u2206a\u03bc are also shown in frames c) and d). These rise for negative values of \u2206mH because\nthe charged Higgs bosons and the lighter charginos and neutralinos become very light with\nthe -inos developing significant higgsino components.\nIn Fig. 13 we show again the variation in sparticle masses with \u2206mH , but this time for\nm0 = 1450 GeV, m1/2 =300GeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0. In this case, the large scalar\nmasses yield a large S term in the RGEs, and the hypercharge enhancement/suppression\nis accentuated. We see, as noted in Ref. [41] for Yukawa unified models, that the \u0169R and\nc\u0303R squarks are driven to very low mass values as \u2206mH increases. At the high end of the\n\u2206mH range, they become the lightest squarks, even lighter than the t\u03031 . The large \u2206mH\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\fparameter space ends when \u0169R becomes a charged/colored LSP, in violation of restrictions\nforbidding such cosmological relics. We also see that as \u2206mH increases, the t\u03031 mass at first\nincreases, then decreases, then increases again. The initial increase is because as \u2206mH\nincreases, Xt decreases, leading to reduced Yukawa coupling suppression of the soft SUSY\nbreaking mass parameters of top squarks. For still larger values of \u2206mH , the S term grows\nand leads to a suppression of the t\u0303R , and hence t\u03031 mass. Finally, as \u2206mH is increased even\nmore, the Xt term becomes large and negative, and again resulting in an increase in the\ntop squark soft masses. We have checked that throughout this range of \u2206mH , the lighter\ntop squark remains predominantly right-handed.\nIn Fig. 14, we show the same frames as in Fig. 12, but now for the m0 = 1450 GeV case.\nAt low \u2206mH values, again \u03bc gets to be small, so that the neutralino becomes higgsino-like\nleading to efficient annihilation in the early universe. At very large \u2206mH values, the relic\ndensity is again in accord with the WMAP analysis \u2013 this time because the squarks become\nso light that neutralinos can efficiently annihilate via Ze1 Ze1 \u2192 u\u016b, cc\u0304 processes occurring\nvia t-channel \u0169R and c\u0303R exchange. Furthermore, if m\u0169R and mc\u0303R are in the 100-200 GeV\nrange, they may be accessible to Tevatron searches! The light squarks also lead to a greatly\nenhanced neutralino-proton scattering rate, and hence to large rates for direct detection of\nrelic neutralinos [41]. There is a small enhancement in \u2206a\u03bc at low \u2206mH where charginos\nand neutralinos become light and higgsino-like, leading to larger chargino-sneutrino and\nneutralino-smuon loop contributions in the evaluation of (g \u2212 2)\u03bc [43].\n3.2 NUHM2 model: parameter space\nOur first display q\nof the parameter space ofqthe NUHM2 model is in Fig. 15, where we show\n2\nthe sign(mHu ) * |m2Hu | vs. sign(m2Hd * |m2Hd | plane for m0 = m1/2 = 300 GeV, with\n\nA0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0 and mt = 178 GeV. In frame a) we show the allowed parameter\nspace as the white region, while theoretically excluded parameter choices are red. The\nregion to the right is excluded because \u03bc2 < 0. In the red region at the bottom, m2A < 0,\ne1 is not the LSP. The blue region is allowed theoretically,\nwhile in that on the top, Z\nbut here, |\u03bc| dives to small values yielding mW\nf1 < 103.5, in violation of the bound from\nLEP2. The parameter space of the NUHM1 model is shown by the black dashed line, where\nm2Hu = m2Hd , while the mSUGRA value point where m2Hu = m2Hd = m20 is shown by a black\ncross. The reader will notice that while the bulk of the parameter space of the NUHM2\nmodel lies above this dashed black line where m2Hd > m2Hu , there is a small portion for\nsmall values of |m2Hu,d | values this is not the case. The reason for this asymmetry is that\nas seen from the EWSB conditions (2.10) and (2.11), the weak scale values of the Higgs\nmass squared parameters must satisfy m2Hd > m2Hu , with m2Hu < 0: if the former inequality\nis badly violated at the GUT scale, radiative corrections cannot \"correct this\", and the\ncorrect pattern of EWSB is not obtained. We also show contours of \u03bc (magenta) ranging\nfrom 300-2000 GeV, where 300 GeV contour is on the far right-hand side. Contours\np of mA\nranging from 300-1500 GeV are also shown, increasing from bottom to top. The \u03c72 value\nis shown in frame b), which shows most of the parameter space is excluded.

The narrow green region at the upper boundary of parameter space corresponds\nto the slepton (or squark for large m0 ) co-annihilation region.\nThe DM allowed regions of parameter space show up more prominently if the paramp\neters m2Hu and m2Hd are traded for mA and \u03bc as inputs.

In frame a), we show\ncontours of \u03bc and mA , while in frame b) we show values of \u03c72 . The yellow region in frame a) is where\nso-called \"GUT stability bound\" is violated. The short-dashed black line denotes the parameter\nspace of the NUHM1 model. The cross denotes the mSUGRA model, while the long-dashed line\ngives the model where the Higgs scalar mass parameters are split as in Fig. 11. The blue region is\nexcluded by LEP2.\n\npoints with low \u03bc and low mA , which only occur in the NUHM2 model, are somewhat\nfavored by the combined constraints. The regions above and left of the GS contour violate\nthe GS condition, while the HS contour denotes the path of the HS model through the\nNUHM2 model parameter space.\nThe predictions for \u03a9Ze1 h2 and contours for BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) and \u2206a\u03bc are separately\nshown in Fig. 17 for a) \u03bc > 0 and also for the disfavored value b) \u03bc < 0. As before, we\ntake m0 = m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10 and mt = 178 GeV. In frame a), the\nbulk of the allowed parameter space is determined by the WMAP allowed region. Within\nthis region, the values of BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) and \u2206a\u03bc determine the best fit, which turns out\nto be mA \u223c 300 GeV and \u03bc \u223c 130 GeV.

A large portion of the WMAP allowed region will also be within reach\nof stage-2 detectors, particularly for low values of the \u03bc parameter. The shape of the VR\ncurves is again readily understood in terms of the interplay of the two effects that we\ndiscussed in detail in Sec. 2.4: the enhancement of the heavy CP -even Higgs exchange\nchannel at low mA , and the increased higgsino fraction, at low values of the \u03bc parameter.\nThe expected flux of muons from neutralino annihilations in the Sun is particularly\nsensitive to the value of the \u03bc parameter: if the latter is sufficiently low, it provides a large\nenough spin-dependent neutralino-proton scattering cross section and a large capture rate\nof neutralinos in the core of the Sun, hence giving a large enough signal at IceCube.\nA comparison of Figs. 18 and 19 shows what we had alluded to in the last section:\nthe Burkert halo profile yields conservative predictions for the prospects for detection of\nrelic LSPs. Indirect detection rates essentially track the size of the mass-rescaled pair\nannihilation rate h\u03c3vi/m2e .

Stage-3 direct detection experiments will thoroughly probe the WMAP allowed\nregion in the left part of the plots, and Stage-2 detectors will have access to a wide portion\nof it. As for the large positive end of the \u2206mH range, a WMAP compatible relic abundance\nis achieved, in both cases, through sfermion co-annihilations. In the m0 = 300 GeV case\nsquarks are heavy, and a light slepton sector does not particularly facilitate direct detection\nof the neutralino, which is found to lie even beyond Stage-3 detectors. 8 In the m0 =\n1450 GeV case, the co-annihilating partners participate in the neutralino-proton scattering\nthrough s-channel squark exchange diagrams.

As a result, when the neutralino thermal relic abundance enters\nthe WMAP region, the expected muon flux gets close to or above the IceCube projected\nsensitivity for a hard neutrino spectrum, and even exceed the Super-Kamiokande limit in\nthe m0 = 1450 GeV case. The abrupt drop in the muon flux visible in the m0 = 1450\nGeV figure, close to the LEP-2 chargino mass limit, is due to the gauge bosons thresholds. As regards the sfermion co-annihilation regions (right panels), light sleptons induce\nonly a slightly larger neutralino pair annihilation cross section (Fig. 22), while the squarkmediated resonant increase in \u03c3Zf1 p produces an extremely large muon flux in the m0 = 1450\nGeV scenario (Fig. 23).\nThe overall summary and comparison of direct and indirect dark matter detection\nmethods considered here is shown in Fig. 24 (m0 = 300 GeV) and Fig. 25 (m0 = 1450\nGeV) for the conservative Bukhert profile. This conservative assumption is why, in both\ncases, the gamma ray flux from the Galactic Center is well below the projected GLAST\nsensitivity. Antimatter searches will instead produce positive results in the higgsino-like\nregion at negative \u2206mH .

We illustrate our points by showing in Table\n2 three cases where the NUHM2 model can be in accord with the WMAP measurement,\nbut which give rise to unique collider phenomenology. All parameter points in this table\nhave the same values of m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0 and mt = 178\nGeV. For the first point, labeled NUHM2a, we take m0 = 300 GeV, with \u03bc = 220 GeV\nand mA = 140 GeV. It occurs in the lower-left region of the plot in Fig. 16 and gives\na relic density \u03a9Ze1 h2 = 0.10. It is characterized by both a low \u03bc and a low mA value,\nunlike the NUHM1 model, which must have one or the other small, but not both, to be\nin accord with WMAP. This point yields light higgsinos and light A, H and H \u00b1 SUSY\n\n\u2013 39 \u2013\n\n\fHiggs bosons. The second point, NUHM2b, has m0 = 300 GeV as well, but has input\nparameters m2Hd = (1651.7 GeV)2 and m2Hu = \u2212(1051.7 GeV)2 . It is characterized by\nrelatively light left-handed sleptons and sneutrinos, due to the large S term in the RGEs.\nFinally, we show NUHM2c, which has m0 = 1450 GeV with m2Hd = (7047.3 GeV)2 and\nm2Hu = \u2212(4147.3 GeV)2 . It is characterized by the presence of very light \u0169R and c\u0303R\nsquarks.

This case does not,\nhowever, seem to be possible because large positive S leads to m2A < 0 and thus a breakdown in the\nREWSB mechanism before the \u1ebdR becomes light enough.\n\n\u2013 40 \u2013\n\n\f3.4.1 Fermilab Tevatron\nThe point NUHM2a with low \u03bc and low mA values will be difficult to probe at the Fermilab\nTevatron. In this case, the chargino and neutralino masses are still rather large, and\nZe2 \u2192 Ze1 e+ e\u2212 has a branching fraction of just 1.5%, so that trilepton signals will be difficult\nto detect above background. The mA and tan \u03b2 values are such that this point lies just\nbeyond a \"hole\" in parameter space where none of the Higgs bosons are accessible to the\nTevatron, even at the 95%CL exclusion level [99, 100]. The point NUHM2b, with relatively\nlight sleptons, will also be difficult to probe at the Tevatron since charginos are quite heavy\nand slepton pairs are difficult to detect for any mass choices [101]. The point NUHM2c has\ntwo flavors of relatively light squarks \u2013 \u0169R and c\u0303R \u2013 but the squark-neutralino mass gap\nis rather small. The signal would be identical to the one searched for in Ref. [102], except\nwith essentially twice the expected cross section for any given squark and LSP masses since\n\u03c3(c\u0303R c\u0303R ) \u2243 \u03c3(\u0169R \u0169R )). It is possible that a dedicated squark search might be able to detect\na signal in the dijet+ 6 ET channel, where relatively low jet ET and 6 ET values \u223c 25 \u2212 50\nGeV might be expected, owing to the small \u0169R \u2212 Ze1 mass gap. Alternatively, if it becomes\npossible to tag c-jets with significant efficiency, it may be possible to suppress backgrounds\nsufficiently to pull out the signal. The phenomenology of light \u0169R and c\u0303R squarks for the\nTevatron is discussed more completely in Ref. [41].\n3.4.2 CERN LHC\nSquarks and gluinos would be produced at large rates at the CERN LHC. Their cascade\ndecays would, in general, lead to the production of Higgs bosons in SUSY events. In the\nNUHM2 model, since the Higgs sector is essentially arbitrary, the heavier Higgs bosons\nH, A and H \u00b1 could decay into other sparticles, resulting in characteristic events at the\nLHC[103]. In the case of the NUHM2a scenario shown in the table, the low value of \u03bc\nimplies the entire spectrum of charginos and neutralinos will be quite light, and accessible\nvia squark and gluino cascade decays. The cascade decays will be much more complex\nthan in a typical mSUGRA scenario, but as for the NUHM1b point discussed earlier,\npotentially offer a rich possibility for extracting information via a variety of mass edges\nthat would be theoretically present. The feasibility of actually doing so would necessitate\ndetailed simulations beyond the scope of the present analysis. In addition, in this scenario,\nthe heavier Higgs bosons are also quite light, and in fact the heavier inos are able to\ndecay into A, H and H \u00b1 with significant rates. The production of H and A followed by\nH, A \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and perhaps also to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , should be detectable at the LHC. In addition,\nW h or tt\u0304h production with W and one of the tops decaying leptonically should also be\ndetectable.\nThe point NUHM2b is characterized by light sleptons. In this case, q\u0303L cascade decays\ne2 \u2192 \u1ebdL e with a branching ratio \u223c 10%, while W\nf1 \u2192 l\u0303L \u03bd + l\u03bd\u0303\nwill be lepton-rich, since Z\ne2 \u2192 \u03bd\u0303\u03bd is also allowed, but in this case the\nessentially 100% of the time. The decay Z\nsneutrino decays invisibly. Gluinos nearly always decay to \u0169R u or c\u0303R c. The squarks then\ne1 and c\u0303R \u2192 cZe1 , so that g\u0303g\u0303 production will give rise to \u223c 4 jet + E\ndecay via \u0169R \u2192 uZ\n6 T\nevents.\n\n\u2013 41 \u2013\n\n\fThe point NUHM2c, characterized by light \u0169R and c\u0303R squarks, will allow for squark\nproduction at very large rates. In addition, g\u0303g\u0303 production followed by g\u0303 \u2192 \u0169R u or c\u0303R c\ne1 decay will be rather\nwill give rise to 2 \u2212 4-jet + E\n6 T events, since the jets from \u0169R \u2192 uZ\ne1 mass gap. The cascade decay events in this case will be\nsoft owing to the small \u0169R \u2212 Z\ne1 h or \u0169R u, c\u0303R c final states, and q\u0303L is heavy so that\nlepton-poor since Ze2 decays mostly to Z\ncharginos are not abundantly produced via their decays.\n3.4.3 Linear e+ e\u2212 collider\nAny scenario similar to that represented by point NUHM2a would be a bonanza for the\n\u221a\nILC. In this case, a s = 0.5 \u2212 0.6 TeV machine would be able to access both chargino and\nall four neutralino states as well as the heavy Higgs bosons H, A and H \u00b1 . The difficulty\nwould be in sorting out the large number of competing reactions, but here, variable center\nof mass energy and beam polarization would be a huge help. A complete reconstruction of\nchargino and neutralino mass matrices may be possible [104]. The low value of mA should\nserve to distinguish this case from a NUHM1a-like scenario.\nIn the case of NUHM2b, the \u03c4\u03031 and \u1ebdL slepton states would be accessible to early\nf \u2212 production. Beam polarization would be a key ingredient in\nf+W\nsearches, along with W\n1\n1\ndetermining that the \u03c4\u03031 and \u1ebdL are left-handed. Determination that \u03c4\u03031 is dominantly \u03c4\u0303L\nand/or m\u1ebdL \u226a m\u1ebdR would already point to an unconventional scenario.\n \u0304 R and c\u0303R \u0304c\u0303R production to occur at large rates\nThe case of NUHM2c would allow \u0169R \u0169\nat an ILC. Again, the beam polarization would easily determine the right-hand nature of\nthese squarks, which would be a key measurement. It should also be possible to determine\ntheir masses [105], and if it is possible to tag c jets with reasonable efficiency, to also\ndistinguish between squark flavors.\nWe note here that in addition, in the NUHM2 model, the reach of an ILC may be\nfar greater than the CERN LHC for supersymmetry. The reason is that the LHC reach\nis mainly determined by the m0 and m1/2 parameters, which determine the overall squark\nand gluino mass scales. In contrast, the ILC reach for chargino pair production depends\nstrongly on the \u03bc parameter. Thus, the NUHM2 case where m0 and m1/2 are large, while\n\u03bc is small may mean chargino pair production is accessible to an ILC while gluino and\nsquark pair production is beyond LHC reach. The case is illustrated in Fig. 26, where\nwe show the m0 vs. m1/2 plane for A0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bc > 0 mt = 178 GeV and a)\n\u03bc = mA = 500 GeV and b) \u03bc = mA = 300 GeV. The yellow and green regions are WMAP\nallowed, while the unshaded regions have \u03a9Ze1 h2 bigger than the WMAP upper bound. The\nyellow bands just above the LEP excluded blue regions in both frames is where 2mZe1 \u2243 mh .\nThe corresponding band in the left panel at m1/2 \u2243 0.6 TeV is the A funnel, while in the\nupper yellow/green regions in both panels the LSP has a significant higgsino content.\nThe SUSY reach of the CERN LHC should be similar to the case of the mSUGRA\nmodel calculated in Ref. [91], and as before, we show this result as an approximate depiction\nof the LHC reach for the case for the NUHM2 model. We also show the mass contour in\n\u221a\na) for a 250 and 500 GeV chargino, accessible to a s = 0.5 or 1 TeV ILC machine. Here,\nthe 1 TeV machine has a reach beyond the large m0 reach of the LHC.

Concluding Remarks\nWe have examined the phenomenological implications of gravity-mediated SUSY breaking\nmodels with universal matter scalars, but with non-universal Higgs soft SUSY breaking\nmasses. For simplicity, we assume a common GUT scale mass parameter for all matter\nscalars \u2013 this guarantees that phenomenological constraints from flavor physics are respected \u2013 but unlike in mSUGRA, entertain the possibility that the soft SUSY breaking\nmass parameters in the Higgs sector are unrelated to the matter scalar mass. In these\nnon-universal Higgs mass (NUHM) models where the Higgs fields Hu and Hd originate in\na common multiplet (as, for instance, in an SO(10) model with a single Higgs field), we\nwould have m2Hu = m2Hd , and there would be just one additional new parameter (NUHM1\nmodel) [25] vis \u00e0 vis mSUGRA, while the more general scenario would have two additional parameters (NUHM2 model). We have found that, once WMAP constraints are\nincorporated into the analysis, this seemingly innocuous extension of the mSUGRA parameter space, which naively would not be expected to affect squark, gluino and slepton\nmasses, significantly expands the possibilities for LHC and linear collider phenomenology\nfrom mSUGRA expectations: phenomena that were considered unlikely because they were\nexpected to occur only in particular corners of parameter space become mainstream in the\nextended model. In the absence of any compelling theory of sparticle masses, the necessity\nfor ensuring that all experimental possibilities are covered is sufficient reason to examine\n\n\u2013 43 \u2013\n\n\fthe consequences of NUHM models, regardless of whether or not one considers these to be\ntheoretically attractive.\nWe have examined the allowed parameter space of the NUHM models with respect to\nneutralino relic density (WMAP), BF (b \u2192 s\u03b3) and \u2206a\u03bc constraints. The WMAP upper\nbound on \u03a9CDM h2 requires rather efficient LSP annihilation, and so severely restricts any\nsupersymmetric model. Aside from the bulk region with small values of bino and scalar\nmasses, enhanced LSP annihilation may occur if the LSP has significant higgsino or wino\ncomponents (the latter is not possible in models with unified gaugino masses10 ), resonantly\nannihilates via Higgs scalars (or Z bosons), or co-annihilates with the stau or some other\ncharged sparticle. Within mSUGRA, the higgsino annihilation region occurs only if m0\nis very large, while resonance annihilation with heavy Higgs scalars is possible only for\nlarge values of tan \u03b2. However, even in the simple one parameter NUHM1 extension of\nmSUGRA, for almost any values of m0 , m1/2 and tan \u03b2, there are two different choices of\nm\u03c6 (defined in the text) that can bring the relic density to be in accord with the WMAP\nmeasurement: for large positive m\u03c6 , one enters the higgsino region, while for large negative\nvalues of m\u03c6 , one enters the A annihilation funnel. The higgsino region with small \u03bc values\ngives rise to large rates for direct and indirect detection of neutralino dark matter, and also\nleads to light charginos and neutralinos which might be accessible to a TeV-scale linear\ne+ e\u2212 collider, or which can enrich the gluino and squark cascade decays expected at the\nCERN LHC. The A-funnel region in the NUHM1 model can also occur at any tan \u03b2 value,\nand usually leads to relatively light H, A and H \u00b1 Higgs bosons which may be accessible\nto collider searches. Also, the expected suppression of e and \u03bc signals from cascade decays,\nwhich is expected in the mSUGRA model for points in the A-funnel due to enhanced -ino\ndecays to taus[107], will not necessarily obtain in the NUHM1 model since tan \u03b2 is not\nrequired to be large. Since the early universe neutralino pair annihilation cross sections\nare enhanced on the A-resonance, indirect DM signals are, in general, enhanced as well.\nThe parameter freedom is enhanced even more in the NUHM2 model. In this case, the\nmSUGRA-fixed parameters \u03bc and mA can now be taken as inputs, rather than outputs.\nThis allows one to always dial in a low value of \u03bc such that one is in the higgsino region,\nor a low value of mA so that one is in the A-funnel. As before, direct and indirect DM\ndetection rates are enhanced in these regions. Collider signals may change as well, since\nnow all charginos and neutralinos can be light, and one can have enhanced cascade decays of\nsquarks and gluinos to charginos, neutralinos and to heavy Higgs bosons. In the case where\nm0 and m1/2 are large, but \u03bc is small, the reach of a LC may exceed that of the CERN\nLHC. In the NUHM2 model, qualitatively new regions emerge where the relic density is\nsuppressed due to novel sparticle mass patterns: very light left-handed sleptons, or very\nlight right-handed up and charm squarks, which have obvious implications for collider\nsignals. The latter case results in large rates for direct and indirect detection of neutralino\nDM, in addition to large jet+ 6 ET signals at hadron colliders, and to the possibility of\nsquark NLSPs at e+ e\u2212 LCs.\nIn conclusion, we have seen that the seemingly innocuous decoupling of scalar Higgs\n10\n\nFor an exception to this, see the 200 model in Ref.[106].\n\n\u2013 44 \u2013\n\n\fmass parameters from other scalar masses can significantly alter our expectations of what\nwe may expect in terms of dark matter as well as (s)particle physics phenomenology. This\nis partly because altering the Higgs potential can dramatically change the value of \u03bc2\nthat yields the correct value of MZ2 , and partly because renormalization group evolution of\nsparticle mass parameters is dramatically altered by a non-zero value of S in the NUHM2\nmodel. For both the NUHM1 and NUHM2 extensions of the mSUGRA model one is able\nto find generic regions of parameter space that are in good agreement with the WMAP\ndetermination of the cold dark matter relic density, as well as with constraints from b \u2192 s\u03b3\nand (g \u2212 2)\u03bc . These regions can lead to distinctive signals at both direct and indirect\ndark matter detection experiments, and also provide distinctive signatures at both the\nCERN LHC pp collider and the International Linear Collider, with a center of mass energy\n\u221a\ns = 0.5 \u2212 1 TeV.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported in part by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
