In this note it is shown that every 7-dimensional Eschenburg space can be\ntotally geodesically embedded into infinitely many topologically distinct 13-dimensional\nBazaikin spaces. Furthermore, examples are given which show that, under the known\nconstruction, it is not always possible to totally geodesically embed a positively curved\nEschenburg space into a Bazaikin space with positive curvature.\n\nIn dimensions 7 and 13 there are two very special families of closed Riemannian\nmanifolds, namely the Eschenburg and Bazaikin spaces. These are defined as quotients of SU(3) and SU(5)/ Sp(2) by free, isometric circle actions (see Section 2 and [AW],\n[Baz], [DE], [Es1], [Ke], [Zi]), where SU(k) has been equipped with a left-invariant, right\nU(k \u2212 1)-invariant metric. In each case there are infinitely many (distinct homotopy\ntypes of) family members admitting positive sectional curvature. Given that there are so\nfew known examples of closed manifolds with positive sectional curvature, these families has been studied extensively (see, for example, [Baz], [CEZ], [DE], [Es1], [Es2], [FZ],\n[GSZ], [Ke], [Kr], [Zi]).\nOne particularly intriguing observation, made in [Ta], is that to each Bazaikin space\nthere can be associated a totally geodesic, embedded Eschenburg space. In fact, as\ndemonstrated in [DE], a Bazaikin space generically contains ten mutually distinct, totally\ngeodesic, embedded Eschenburg spaces. This led to the question: given an Eschenburg\nspace, does there exist a (non-singular) Bazaikin space containing it as a totally geodesic,\nembedded submanifold?\n7\nTheorem A. For any given Eschenburg space Ea,b\n, there exist infinitely many mutually non7\nhomotopy equivalent Bazaikin spaces into which Ea,b\ncan be embedded as a totally geodesic submanifold.\n\nIn [DE] it has also been proven that a Bazaikin space is positively curved if and only\nif each of the ten embedded, totally geodesic Eschenburg spaces it contains are also\npositively curved. On the other hand, it is well-known (see [DE], [Zi]) that all positively curved Aloff-Wallach spaces (see [AW]), that is, the subfamily of homogeneous Eschenburg spaces, and all positively curved cohomogeneity-one Eschenburg spaces (see\n[GSZ]) can be embedded as totally geodesic submanifolds of positively curved Bazaikin\nspaces. This raises the question of whether this is true in general. However, at least for\nthe known construction of a totally geodesic embedding, there exist counter-examples\nalready in cohomogeneity-two, see Table 1 in Section 5.\nDate: December 2, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C20.\nKey words and phrases. positive curvature, biquotients, Lie groups, totally geodesic embeddings.\n\u2217 This research was carried out as part of SFB 878: Groups, Geometry & Actions, at the University of\nM\u00fcnster.\n\n\f2\n\nM. KERIN\n\nThe article is organised as follows. In Section 1 the basic notation and definitions\nfor biquotients are reviewed. Section 2 provides a brief summary of Eschenburg and\nBazaikin spaces, while Section 3 recalls how to each Bazaikin space there correspond ten\ntotally geodesic, embedded Eschenburg spaces. In Section 4 the proof of Theorem A is\ngiven and, finally, in Section 5 the ability to embed a positively curved Eschenburg space\nas a totally geodesic submanifold of a positively curved Bazaikin space is discussed.\n\n1. B IQUOTIENTS\n\nAND INDUCED METRICS\n\nThe following section provides a review of some material from [Es1] which establishes\nthe basic ideas and notation which will be used throughout the remainder of the article.\nLet G be a compact Lie group, U \u2282 G\u00d7 G a closed subgroup, and let U act (effectively)\non G via\n(1.1)\n\n(u1 , u2 ) \u22c6 g = u1 gu\u22121\n2 , g \u2208 G, (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U.\n\nThe resulting quotient G//U is called a biquotient. The action (1.1) is free if and only if, for\nall non-trivial (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U , u1 is never conjugate to u2 in G. In the event that the action of\nU is ineffective, the quotient G//U will be a manifold so long as any element (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U\nwhich fixes some g \u2208 G fixes all of G, that is, (u1 , u2 ) lies in the ineffective kernel. A\nbiquotient is non-singular if the action (1.1) is free (modulo any ineffective kernel), and\nsingular otherwise.\nLet K \u2282 G be a closed subgroup. Suppose we have a biquotient G//U , where U \u2282\nG \u00d7 K \u2282 G \u00d7 G and G is equipped with a left-invariant, right K-invariant metric h , i.\nThen U acts by isometries on G and therefore the submersion G \u2192 G//U induces a metric\non G//U from the metric on G. We encode this in the notation (G, h , i)//U .\nNow, for g \u2208 G define\nULg := {(gu1 g \u22121 , u2 ) | (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U },\nURg := {(u1 , gu2 g \u22121 ) | (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U }, and\nb := {(u2 , u1 ) | (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U }.\nU\n\nb act freely on G, and G//U is isometric to G//U g , diffeomorphic to\nThen ULg , URg and U\nL\ng\nb (isometric if U \u2282 K \u00d7 K).\nG//UR (isometric if g \u2208 K), and diffeomorphic to G//U\nIn the case of ULg this follows from the fact that left-translation Lg : G \u2192 G is an isome\u2032 \u22121\ntry which satisfies gu1 g \u22121 (Lg g \u2032 )u\u22121\n2 = Lg (u1 g u2 ). Therefore Lg induces an isometry of\nthe orbit spaces G//U and G//ULg . Similarly we find that Rg\u22121 induces a diffeomorphism\nbetween G//U and G//URg , which is an isometry if g \u2208 K.\nb . The actions of U and U\nb are equivariant under the diffeomorphism\nConsider now U\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03c4 : G \u2192 G, \u03c4 (g) := g . That is, u1 \u03c4 (g)u2 = \u03c4 (u2 gu\u22121\n1 ). Notice that this is an isometry\nb are therefore diffeomorphic but not\nonly if U \u2282 K \u00d7 K. In general G//U and G//U\nisometric.\nFor completeness we remark that it is, in fact, simple to equip G with a left-invariant,\nright K-invariant metric. Given K \u2282 G, let k \u2282 g be the corresponding Lie algebras and\nlet h , i0 be a bi-invariant metric on G. One can write g = k\u2295 p with respect to h , i0 . Recall\nthat G \u223c\n= (G \u00d7 K)/\u2206K via (g, k) 7\u2192 gk \u22121 , where \u2206K = {(k, k) | k \u2208 K} acts diagonally\non the right of G \u00d7 K. Thus we may define a left-invariant, right K-invariant metric h , i\n\n\fTOTALLY GEODESIC EMBEDDINGS\n\n3\n\non G via the Riemannian submersion\n(G \u00d7 K, h , i0 \u2295 th , i0 |k ) \u2192 (G, h , i)\n(g, k) 7\u2192 gk \u22121 ,\nwhere t > 0 and\n(1.2)\n\nh , i = h , i0 |p + \u03bbh , i0 |k , \u03bb =\n2.

Indeed, Sa,b \u2282 S(U(3) \u00d7 U(3)) := {(A, B) \u2208 U(3) \u00d7 U(3) |\ndet A = det B}. This is not a problem, however, since the bi-invariant metric on SU(3)\ncan be thought of as the restriction of the the analogously defined bi-invariant metric on\nU(3). Hence, an element of (A, B) \u2208 S(U(3) \u00d7 U(3)) maps (SU(3), h , i0 ) isometrically to\nitself via X \u2208 SU(3) 7\u2192 AXB \u22121 . In particular, conjugation by an element of the centre of\nU(3) is an isometry (namely, the identity map) of (SU(3), h , i0 ), and remains an isometry\nwith respect to the new metric h , i. Therefore the Eschenburg biquotient Ea7\u2032 ,b\u2032 defined by\nthe action of the circle Sa1\u2032 ,b\u2032 , where a\u2032 = (a1 +c, a2 +c, a3 +c) and b\u2032 = (b1 +c, b2 +c, b3 +c),\n7\nwith c \u2208 Z, is isometric to Ea,b\n. Furthermore, introducing an ineffective kernel to the\n7\ncircle action will not alter the isometry class of the biquotient. Thus E\u00e3,\ndefined by\nb\u0303\n7\n\u00e3 = (ka1 , ka2 , ka3 ) and b\u0303 = (kb1 , kb2 , kb3 ) is isometric to Ea,b\n. In particular, it follows\n1\nthat a circle action by Sa,b \u2282 S(U(3) \u00d7 U(3)) can then be rewritten as the action of a\ncircle subgroup of SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) via the change of parameters (a1 , a2 , a3 , b1 , b2 , b3 ) 7\u2192\nP\nP\n(3a1 \u2212 \u03ba, 3a2 \u2212 \u03ba, 3a3 \u2212 \u03ba, 3b1 \u2212 \u03ba, 3b2 \u2212 \u03ba, 3b3 \u2212 \u03ba), where \u03ba :=\nai =\nbi , without\nchanging the isometry class.\n1\n-action, permuting the ai (via the action\nFrom Section 1 it is clear that, for the Sa,b\nof the Weyl group of SU(3)) and permuting b2 , b3 are isometries, while permuting all\nof the bi and swapping a, b are diffeomorphisms. Indeed, given our fixed choice of\nembedding U(2) \u0592\u2192 SU(3), cyclic permutations of the bi (and, similarly, swapping a and\nb and considering cyclic permutations of the ai ) induce, in general, non-isometric metrics\n7\non the quotient Ea,b\n.\n7\n1\nIt was shown in [Es1] that an Eschenburg biquotient Ea,b\n= (SU(3), h , i)//Sa,b\nhas\npositive curvature if and only if bi 6\u2208 [a, a] for all i = 1, 2, 3, where a := min{a1 , a2 , a3 },\na := max{a1 , a2 , a3 }.\n\n\f4\n\nM. KERIN\n\nIn order to define the Bazaikin spaces (see [Baz], [Zi], [DE]), first let\nSp(2) * Sq11 ,...,q5 = (Sp(2) \u00d7 Sq11 ,...,q5 )/Z2 , Z2 = {\u00b1(1, I)},\nwhere q1 , . . . , q5 \u2208 Z and Sp(2) is considered as a subgroup of SU(4) via the inclusion\nSp(2) \u0592\u2192 SU(4) given by\n!\nS T\n(2.2)\nA = S + T j \u2208 Sp(2) 7\u2192 \u00c2 =\n\u2208 SU(4), S, T \u2208 M2 (C).\n\u2212T\u0304 S\u0304\nEquip SU(5) with a left-invariant and right U(4)-invariant metric h , i as defined in (1.2),\nwhere U(4) \u0592\u2192 SU(5) via A \u2208 U(4) 7\u2192 diag(det A, A) \u2208 SU(5).\nThen Sp(2) * Sq11 ,...,q5 acts effectively and isometrically on (SU(5), h , i) via\n[A, z] \u22c6 B = diag(z q1 , . . . , z q5 ) * B * diag(z\u0304 q , \u00c2),\nP\nwith q :=\nqi , z \u2208 S 1 , B \u2208 SU(5), and A \u2208 Sp(2) \u2282 SU(4). The quotient Bq131 ,...,q5 :=\n(SU(5), h , i)// Sp(2) * Sq11 ,...,q5 is called a Bazaikin biquotient.\nIt is not difficult to show that the action of Sp(2) * Sq11 ,...,q5 is free (hence Bq131 ,...,q5 is a\nBazaikin space) if and only all q1 , . . . , q5 are odd and\n(2.3)\n\ngcd(q\u03c3(1) + q\u03c3(2) , q\u03c3(3) + q\u03c3(4) ) = 2 for all permutations \u03c3 \u2208 S5 .\n\nFrom the discussion in Section 1 it follows that permuting the qi is an isometry of Bq131 ,...,q5 .\nFurthermore, it is well-known (see [Zi], [DE]) that a general Bazaikin biquotient Bq131 ,...,q5\nadmits positive curvature if and only if qi + qj > 0 (or < 0) for all 1 6 i < j 6 5.\n3.

Every element of S(U(3) \u00d7 U(2))/\u2206 U(2) has\na unique representative of the form diag(B, I), where\n(3.2)\n\nB=X\n\n1\n\nYt\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2208 SU(3), with X \u2208 U(3), Y \u2208 U(2) and det Y = det X.\n\nTherefore S(U(3) \u00d7 U(2))/\u2206 U(2) is a totally geodesic copy of SU(3) inside SU(5)/ Sp(2).\nThe induced metric on SU(3) \u223c\n= S(U(3) \u00d7 U(2))/\u2206 U(2) \u2282 SU(5)/ Sp(2) is invariant\nunder SU(3) \u00d7 U(2) and, after the identification (3.2), one may consider this metric as\na left-invariant, right U(2)-invariant metric on SU(3) of the form described in Section\n\n\fTOTALLY GEODESIC EMBEDDINGS\n\n5\n\n2. Indeed, the identity component of the total isometry group of SU(3) \u223c\n= S(U(3) \u00d7\nU(2))/\u2206 U(2) is given by\n(\n!\n!!\n)\nZ\nw\nIsom(SU(3)) =\n,\n| (Z, W ) \u2208 U (3) \u00d7 U (2), w = (det Z)(det W )\nW\nI\n\u223c\n= U(3) \u00d7 U(2)\nand acts on SU(3) \u223c\n= S(U(3) \u00d7 U(2))/\u2206 U(2) via\n!\n!! \"\n!# \"\n!#\nZ\nw\nB\nZB ( w\u0304 I )\n,\n\u22c6\n=\nW\nI\nI\nW\n!#\n\"\n\u0001\nZB w\u0304 W t\n(3.3)\n=\nI\nwhere [diag(B, I)] \u2208 SU(3), (Z, W ) \u2208 U(3) \u00d7 U(2) and w = (det Z)(det W ).\nNow, if the isometric left-action of Sq11 ,...,q5 on SU(5)/ Sp(2) is free with ineffective\nkernel {\u00b11}, the same must be true of the induced action on the totally geodesic submanifold SU(3) \u223c\n= S(U(3) \u00d7 U(2))/\u2206 U(2). From (3.3) it is clear that the action on SU(3)\nis given by\nz \u22c6 B = diag(z q1 , z q2 , z q3 )B diag(z\u0304 q , z q4 , z q5 ), B \u2208 SU(3), z \u2208 S 1 ,\nP\nwhere q =\nqi . The quotient is an Eschenburg space SU(3)//Sq11 ,...,q5 totally geodesically embedded in the Bazaikin space Bq131 ,...,q5 . The circle action defining the Eschenburg space can be made effective. Indeed, since the qi are odd and from the discussion\nof reparameterisations in Section 2, it follows that the Eschenburg space SU(3)//Sq11 ,...,q5\n7\nis isometric to the Eschenburg space Ea,b\n, where a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) = ( 21 (q1 \u2212 1), 12 (q2 \u2212\n1), 12 (q3 \u2212 1)) and b = (b1 , b2 , b3 ) = ( 12 (q \u2212 1), \u2212 21 (q4 + 1), \u2212 12 (q5 + 1)).\nIt is now simple to recover the remaining nine totally geodesic, embedded Eschenburg spaces in Bq131 ,...,q5 . As every permutation \u03c3 \u2208 S5 of the qi is an isometry, it follows that Bq131 ,...,q5 = Bq13\u03c3(1) ,...,q\u03c3(5) and hence, by the same reasoning as before, the Eschenburg space Ea7\u03c3 ,b\u03c3 , where a\u03c3 = ( 21 (q\u03c3(1) \u2212 1), 21 (q\u03c3(2) \u2212 1), 12 (q\u03c3(3) \u2212 1)) and b\u03c3 =\n( 12 (q \u2212 1), \u2212 21 (q\u03c3(4) + 1), \u2212 21 (q\u03c3(5) + 1)), is a totally geodesic, embedded submanifold.\nThat generically there are ten such submanifolds follows since permutations of the entries of a\u03c3 , and of the last two entries of b\u03c3 , are isometries. This, of course, is equivalent\nto fixing the order of the qi and permuting the signs of the entries along the diagonal in\nthe involution (3.1) acting on SU(5), thus achieving ten (isometric) copies of SU(3) which\nquotient to the desired Eschenburg spaces (see [DE]).\n4. T OTALLY GEODESIC\n\nEMBEDDINGS OF\n\nE SCHENBURG\n\nSPACES\n\nIn Section 3 it was shown that every Bazaikin space contains a totally geodesically\nembedded Eschenburg space. The converse statement, namely that every Eschenburg\nspace can be totally geodesically embedded into a Bazaikin space, is also true. Indeed,\nit will now be shown that every Eschenburg space can be totally geodesically embedded\ninto infinitely many Bazaikin spaces.\n7\nLet Ea,b\nbe the Eschenburg space given by a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ), b = (b1 , b2 , b3 ) \u2208 Z3 with\nP\nP\nai = bi and satisfying the freeness condition (2.1):\ngcd(a1 \u2212 b\u03c3(1) , a2 \u2212 b\u03c3(2) ) = 1 for all permutations \u03c3 \u2208 S3 .\n\n\f6\n\nM. KERIN\n\nBy the discussion in Section 3, a candidate for a Bazaikin space into which to embed is\ngiven by the 5-tuple (q1 , . . . , q5 ) := (2a1 + 1, 2a2 + 1, 2a3 + 1, \u2212(2b2 + 1), \u2212(2b3 + 1)), with\nP\nq = qi = 2b1 + 1. As each of the qi is odd, one need only check the condition (2.3):\n\ngcd(q\u03c3(1) + q\u03c3(2) , q\u03c3(3) + q\u03c3(4) ) = 2 for all permutations \u03c3 \u2208 S5 .\nP\nP\nIt follows from the Eschenburg freeness condition (2.1) (and from\nai =\nbi ) that\ngcd(q4 + qi , q5 + qj ) = 2 for all i 6= j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Furthermore, if {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} and\nP\n{l, m} = {4, 5}, then since q = qi it follows that\ngcd(qi + qj , qk + ql ) = gcd(qi + qj , q \u2212 qm )\n\n= gcd(q \u2212 qm , qk + ql )\nand that gcd(qi + qj , q4 + q5 ) = gcd(qi + qj , q \u2212 qk ).\nHence the 5-tuple (q1 , . . . , q5 ) = (2a1 +1, 2a2 +1, 2a3 +1, \u2212(2b2 +1), \u2212(2b3 +1)) defines\na Bazaikin space if and only if\ndkl := gcd(ai + aj + 1, ak \u2212 bl ) = 1 for all l \u2208 {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}.\nP\nP\nLemma 4.1. Let a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ), b = (b1 , b2 , b3 ) \u2208 Z3 satisfy (2.1) and ai = bi . Suppose\nthat p is a prime divisor of gcd(ai + aj + 1, ak \u2212 bl ), where l \u2208 {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. Then p is\nodd.\nP\nP\nProof. By (2.1) together with\nai =\nbi it follows that either all ai or all bi have the\nsame parity. Hence either all ai + aj + 1 or all bm + bn + 1 are odd, where 1 6 i < j 6 3,\n1 6 m < n 6 3. Since gcd(ai + aj + 1, ak \u2212 bl ) = gcd(bm + bn + 1, ak \u2212 bl ), where\n{i, j, k} = {l, m, n} = {1, 2, 3}, the conclusion follows.\n\u0003\n(4.1)\n\n7\nRecall now that one can (isometrically) rewrite the Eschenburg space Ea,b\nas Ea7c ,bc ,\nwhere ac = (a1 + c, a2 + c, a3 + c) and bc = (b1 + c, b2 + c, b3 + c), for any c \u2208 Z. In this\ncase the candidate Bazaikin biquotient is given by the 5-tuple (q1c , . . . , q5c ) := (2(a1 + c) +\nP c\n1, 2(a2 +c)+1, 2(a3 +c)+1, \u2212(2(b2 +c)+1), \u2212(2(b3 +c)+1)), with q c =\nqi = 2(b1 +c)+1.\nAnalogously to above, this Bazaikin biquotient is non-singular if and only if\n\ndckl := gcd(ai + aj + 1 + 2c, ak \u2212 bl ) = 1 for all l \u2208 {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}.\nP\nP\nLemma 4.2. Let a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ), b = (b1 , b2 , b3 ) \u2208 Z3 satisfy (2.1) and ai =\nbi . For all\nl \u2208 {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, let pkl1 , . . . , pklrkl be the prime divisors, if any, of ak \u2212 bl which satisfy\ngcd(pkl\u03c4 , ai + aj + 1) = 1, for all 1 6 \u03c4 6 rkl . Set\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\u03bc\nrkl\n3\nY\nY\n(4.3)\nc = c\u03bc := \u00b12\u03bc\u22121 \uf8ed\npkl\u03c4 \uf8f8 ,\n(4.2)\n\nk,l=1 \u03c4 =1\n\nwhere \u03bc is an arbitrary positive integer. Then dckl = gcd(ai + aj + 1 + 2c, ak \u2212 bl ) = 1.\n\nProof. Suppose that p is a prime divisor of dckl . As p divides ak \u2212 bl , then p divides either\nai + aj + 1 or c. But p divides ai + aj + 1 + 2c, hence must divide both ai + aj + 1 and c, and\nfurthermore must be odd by Lemma 4.1. Now, by definition of c, p must divide at \u2212 bu ,\nfor some (t, u) 6= (k, l), and must satisfy gcd(p, ar + as + 1) = 1, where {r, s, t} = {1, 2, 3}.\nHowever, because of the freeness condition (2.1) for Eschenburg spaces, either t = k\nor u = l. If t = k, then 1 = gcd(p, ar + as + 1) = gcd(p, ai + aj + 1) = p. On the\nother hand, if u = l then k 6= t \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, that is, it may assumed without loss of\ngenerality that (t, u) = (i, l). As p divides ai + aj + 1, ak \u2212 bl and ai \u2212 bl , it follows that\n\n\fTOTALLY GEODESIC EMBEDDINGS\n\n7\n\n1 = gcd(p, ar + as + 1) = gcd(p, aj + ak + 1) = gcd(p, (ai + aj + 1) + (ak \u2212 bl ) \u2212 (ai \u2212 bl )) =\np.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.3. With notation as above, for all c = c\u03bc , \u03bc \u2208 Z, \u03bc > 0, the Bazaikin biquotient\n7\n= Ea7c ,bc as a totally geodesic submanifold.\nBq131c ,...,q5c is non-singular and contains Ea,b\nRemark 4.4. The conditions (4.1) and (2.1) ensuring that the Bazaikin biquotient is nonsingular are precisely the conditions which ensure that all ten of the totally geodesic,\nembedded Eschenburg biquotients are themselves non-singular. The equivalence of the\nnon-singularity of the Bazaikin biquotient and these ten submanifolds was already observed in [DE].\nRemark 4.5.

KERIN\n\nCorollary 4.7. The collection of Bazaikin spaces into which a particular Eschenburg space can\nbe totally geodesically embedded consists of infinitely many distinct homotopy types.\n7\nProof. Given an Eschenburg space Ea,b\nand c of the form (4.3), it has been shown that\n7\nthere is a totally geodesic embedding of Ea,b\ninto each Bazaikin space Bq131c ,...,q5c , where\n(q1c , . . . , q5c ) = (2a1 + 2c + 1, 2a2 + 2c + 1, 2a3 + 2c + 1, \u22122b2 \u2212 2c \u2212 1, \u22122b3 \u2212 2c \u2212 1). Fix one\nsuch value of c, that is, fix some \u03bc > 0. Since 2\u03bc\u22121 > 1 for \u03bc > 1, we may assume without\nloss of generality that |c| > 1. Let c1 = c\u03b11 and c2 = c\u03b12 for some 0 < \u03b11 < \u03b12 . With the\nsame notation as in Lemma 4.6, the order of H 6 for the Bazaikin space corresponding to\nci is given by si = 81 |\u03c33 (qci )|, for i = 1, 2 respectively. By Lemma 4.6, s1 = s2 if and only\nif either \u03c32 (a) \u2212 \u03c32 (b) = 0 or\n\n(4.4)\n\nc1 + c2 =\n\n\u03c33 (a) \u2212 \u03c33 (b)\n\u2212 \u03c31 (a) \u2212 1.\n\u03c32 (a) \u2212 \u03c32 (b)\n\nBut, by [Kr, Remark 1.3], \u03c32 (a) \u2212 \u03c32 (b) is odd, hence non-zero. Therefore (4.4) must hold.\nHowever, as the right-hand side is constant, it is clear that (4.4) can hold for at most one\npair 0 < \u03b11 < \u03b12 .\n\u0003\nThe following example shows that the c values given in Lemma 4.2 do not achieve all\nBazaikin spaces into which an Eschenburg space can be totally geodesically embedded.\n7\nExample 4.8. Consider the positively curved Eschenburg space Ea,b\ngiven by a = (2, 0, 0)\nand b = (15, \u22122, \u221211). The corresponding candidate for a Bazaikin space is given by\nq = (5, 1, 1, 3, 21), which is singular because gcd(q1 + q2 , q4 + q5 ) = 6.\n7\nBy the expression in (4.3), Ea,b\ncan be totally geodesically embedded into each of the\nBazaikin spaces given by (5 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 3 \u2212 2c, 21 \u2212 2c), with c = \u00b12\u03bc\u22121 (23 * 52 *\n112 * 132 )\u03bc , for \u03bc > 0. None of these spaces is positively curved, since it is clear that any\nvalue of \u03bc > 0 leads to qi + qj of mixed signs.\n7\nOn the other hand, note that when c = \u22121 the Eschenburg space Ea,b\ncan be rewritten\n7\nas E\u00e3,b\u0303 , with \u00e3 = (1, \u22121, \u22121) and b\u0303 = (14, \u22123, \u221212), and the corresponding Bazaikin\nbiquotient Bq\u030313 with q\u0303 = (3, \u22121, \u22121, 5, 23) is non-singular. Note that Bq\u030313 does not have\npositive curvature.\nHowever, when c = 2 and when c = 5, the resulting biquotients are both non-singular\nand positively curved, namely the Bazaikin spaces Bq13\u2032 , with q \u2032 = (9, 5, 5, \u22121, 17) (corresponding to a\u2032 = (4, 2, 2), b\u2032 = (17, 0, \u22129)), and Bq13\u2032\u2032 , with q \u2032\u2032 = (15, 11, 11, \u22127, 11)\n(corresponding to a\u2032 = (7, 5, 5), b\u2032 = (20, 3, \u22126)).\nFinally, notice that the order of H 6 is 503, 1541 and 2579 for Bq\u030313 , Bq13\u2032 and Bq13\u2032\u2032 respectively, hence these spaces are not even homotopy equivalent.\n\n5. E MBEDDINGS\n\nINDUCING POSITIVE SECTIONAL CURVATURE\n\nGiven that every Eschenburg space can be totally geodesically embedded into infinitely many Bazaikin spaces, it is natural to ask whether a positively curved Eschenburg\nspace admits a totally geodesic embedding into a positively curved Bazaikin space.\n7\nRecall that an Eschenburg space Ea,b\nhas positive curvature if and only if bi 6\u2208 [a, a]\nP\nP\nbj ,\nfor all i = 1, 2, 3, where a := min{a1 , a2 , a3 }, a := max{a1 , a2 , a3 }. Because aj =\nthis is equivalent to the requirement that two of the bi lie on one side of [a, a], and one\n7\non the other. Indeed, given the metric on Ea,b\ndefined in Section 2, it turns out that\nb2 and b3 must lie on the same side of [a, a], see [Es1], [Ke]. Since permuting the ai\n\n\fTOTALLY GEODESIC EMBEDDINGS\n\n9\n\nand permuting b2 and b3 are isometries, the condition for positive curvature is, after\nrelabelling if necessary, equivalent to\n(5.1)\n\nb3 6 b2 < a3 6 a2 6 a1 < b1 or b1 < a1 6 a2 6 a3 < b2 6 b3 .\n\nIn fact, the second chain of inqualities is equivalent to the first via the reparametrization\n1\nof Sa,b\nvia z 7\u2192 z\u0304, and therefore one may restrict attention to the first chain.\n7\nNow Ea,b\ncan be totally geodesically embedded into the (possibly singular) Bazaikin\n13\nbiquotient Bq1 ,...,q5 , with (q1 , . . . , q5 ) = (2a1 + 1, 2a2 + 1, 2a3 + 1, \u2212(2b2 + 1), \u2212(2b3 + 1)).\nAs discussed in Section 2, Bq131 ,...,q5 has positive curvature if and only if qi + qj > 0 (or\n< 0) for all 1 6 i < j 6 5. Since the first chain of inequalities in (5.1) implies that\nqi + qj = 2(ai \u2212 bj\u22122 ) > 0, for all i = 1, 2, 3, j = 4, 5, it follows that Bq131 ,...,q5 has positive\ncurvature if ai + aj + 1 > 0, for all 1 6 i < j 6 3, and b2 + b3 + 1 < 0. But a3 6 a2 6 a1 ,\nhence Bq131 ,...,q5 has positive curvature if and only if\n(5.2)\n\nb2 + b3 + 1 < 0 < a2 + a3 + 1.\n\nIn particular, it is necessary that 0 6 a2 6 a1 < b1 and b3 6 \u22121. Clearly the special case\nb2 < 0 6 a3 ensures that the inequalities in (5.2) are satisfied.\nIf Bq131 ,...,q5 does not have positive curvature, then one can find a c \u2208 Z such that the\nBazaikin biquotient Bq131c ,...,q5c , with\n(q1c , . . . , q5c ) := (2(a1 + c) + 1, 2(a2 + c) + 1, 2(a3 + c) + 1, \u2212(2(b2 + c) + 1), \u2212(2(b3 + c) + 1)),\nis positively curved. Indeed, Bq131c ,...,q5c has positive curvature if and only if c \u2208 Z satisfies\n1\n1\n\u2212 (a2 + a3 + 1) < c < \u2212 (b2 + b3 + 1).\n2\n2\nIt then remains only to examine the values of c given by (5.3) to determine which, if any,\nof the Bazaikin biquotients Bq131c ,...,q5c are non-singular.\nOne particular example, where an embedding into a positively curved Bazaikin space\nexists, is that of a positively curved Eschenburg space of cohomogeneity-one, given by\na = (p, 1, 1), b = (p + 2, 0, 0), with p > 1. Here (5.3) yields \u22121 6 c 6 0. Indeed, c = \u22121\nensures that Bq131c ,...,q5c is non-singular and positively curved. This was first observed by\nW. Ziller and appeared in [DE].\nNote that in this example c = \u2212a3 = \u22121. Indeed, for an arbitrary Eschenburg space\n7\nEa,b , the choice c = \u2212a3 ensures Bq131c ,...,q5c has positive curvature, although in general one\ncannot hope that this space will be non-singular. Example 4.8 illustrates this phenomenon and, furthermore, that the values of c suggested by the expression (4.3) are not of\nmuch use when it comes to finding a Bazaikin space of positive curvature.\nIt turns out, in fact, that there are examples of positively curved Eschenburg spaces for\nwhich none of the values of c coming from (5.3) yield a non-singular Bazaikin biquotient,\nthat is, a totally geodesic embedding constructed as in Section 4 cannot be into a positively curved Bazaikin space. A list of such examples is given in Table 1. Notice, in particular, that the first and last examples in Table 1 are Eschenburg spaces of cohomogeneitytwo (see [GSZ]). In fact, there are infinitely many such cohomogeneity-two examples, for\nexample, the infinite families given by a = (15015k + 39, 0, 0), b = (15015k + 55, \u22123, \u221213),\nk > 0, and a = (15015k + 12909, 0, 0), b = (15015k + 12925, \u22123, \u221213), k > 0, respectively.\n\n(5.3)\n\n1\nRemark 5.1. One might hope that introducing an ineffective kernel into the Sa,b\naction\n7\ndefining a positively curved Eschenburg space Ea,b would yield a Bazaikin space with\n\n\f10\n\nM. KERIN\n\npositive curvature into which it can be totally geodesically embedded. However, such a\nmodification reduces to the case discussed above. Indeed, if \u00e3 = (\u03bba1 +d, \u03bba2 +d, \u03bba3 +d)\nand b\u0303 = (\u03bbb1 + d, \u03bbb2 + d, \u03bbb3 + d), where without loss of generality \u03bb > 0, then, by\n(2.1), gcd(\u00e3i \u2212 b\u0303l , \u00e3j \u2212 b\u0303m ) = \u03bb. Hence the candidate for a positively curved Bazaikin\nspace Bq\u030313 is given by q\u0303 = (2\u00e31 + 1, 2\u00e32 + 1, 2\u00e33 + 1, \u2212(2b\u03032 + 1), \u2212(2b\u03033 + 1)), where\ngcd(\u00e3i + \u00e3j +1, \u00e3k \u2212 b\u0303l ) = \u03bb, for all l \u2208 {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, and \u00e32 + \u00e33 +1 > 0 > b\u03032 + b\u03033 +1.\nConsequently \u03bb must be odd and there is c \u2208 Z such that 2d + 1 = \u03bb(2c + 1), in which\ncase Bq\u030313 is non-singular if and only if (2.1) and (4.2) hold, and has positive curvature if\nand only if (5.3) is satisfied.\nE7a,b\na\n\nb\n\nB13\nqc1 ,...,qc5\nc\n(q1 , . . . , qc5 )\n\n(39, 0, 0)\n(55, \u22123, \u221213)\n(79 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 25 \u2212 2c)\n(77, 2, 0)\n(93, \u22123, \u221211)\n(155 + 2c, 5 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 21 \u2212 2c)\n(171, 2, 0)\n(187, \u22123, \u221211)\n(343 + 2c, 5 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 21 \u2212 2c)\n(225, 4, 0)\n(247, \u22125, \u221213)\n(451 + 2c, 9 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 9 \u2212 2c, 25 \u2212 2c)\n(281, 3, 0)\n(294, \u22122, \u22128)\n(563 + 2c, 7 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 3 \u2212 2c, 15 \u2212 2c)\n(309, 6, 0)\n(323, \u22123, \u22125)\n(619 + 2c, 13 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 9 \u2212 2c)\n(664, 2, 0)\n(678, \u22123, \u22129)\n(1329 + 2c, 5 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 17 \u2212 2c)\n(827, 4, 0)\n(843, \u22123, \u22129)\n(1655 + 2c, 9 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 17 \u2212 2c)\n(12909, 0, 0) (12925, \u22123, \u221213) (25819 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 1 + 2c, 5 \u2212 2c, 25 \u2212 2c)\n\nsec > 0\n06c67\n\u22121 6 c 6 6\n\u22121 6 c 6 6\n\u22122 6 c 6 8\n\u22121 6 c 6 4\n\u22123 6 c 6 3\n\u22121 6 c 6 5\n\u22122 6 c 6 5\n06c67\n\nTABLE 1.
