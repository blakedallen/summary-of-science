These proteins coherently oscillate from end to end of\nthe bacterium. We present a reaction\u2013diffusion model describing the diffusion of min proteins along\nthe bacterium and their transfer between the cytoplasmic membrane and cytoplasm. Our model\nspontaneously generates protein oscillations in good agreement with experiments. We explore the\noscillation stability, frequency and wavelength as a function of protein concentration and bacterial\nlength.\n\nThe subcellular spatial and temporal organization of\nbacterial proteins is largely unknown. Already, the spatial distribution of proteins on the cytoplasmic membrane\nof bacteria are known to be important for chemotaxis [1]\nand for DNA replication [2]. Improving our understanding of how this supra\u2013molecular organization of proteins\naffects bacterial function represents a considerable experimental and theoretical challenge. In contrast to nucleated eukaryotic cells, no large organelles are present in\nthe bacterial interior (cytoplasm) and no active transport mechanisms such as molecular motors are known to\nfunction there. However, recent video microscopy of fluorescently labeled proteins involved in the regulation of E.\ncoli division have uncovered coherent and stable spatial\nand temporal oscillations in three proteins: MinC, MinD,\nand MinE [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The proteins oscillate from\nend to end of the bacterium, and move between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. These min proteins select the site for the next bacterial division [9, 10].\nDespite a wealth of phenomenological detail, no quantitative models have been developed of how the min proteins organize into oscillating structures. Understanding\nthe self\u2013organized patterns involved in bacterial division\nprocesses can give us insight into how a bacterium can\ndynamically compartmentalize itself.\nWe focus on E. coli, a commonly\u2013studied rod shaped\nbacterium, approximately 2 \u2212 6 \u03bcm in length and around\n1 \u2212 1.5\u03bcm in diameter. Each E. coli divides roughly every hour, depending on the conditions - first replicating\nits DNA then dividing in half to form two viable daughter cells. The MinCDE oscillations are known to persist even when protein synthesis is suppressed [3], and\nDNA replication and septation occur even without the\nmin proteins. Hence the min system can be studied independently of the other division processes. Efficient division requires many processes, including DNA replication,\nMinCDE oscillations, and the actual septation process.\nSeptation initiates with a contractile polymeric \"Z\u2013ring\"\nof a tubulin\u2013homologue FtsZ that forms just underneath\nthe cytoplasmic membrane. The FtsZ septation rings\n\nlargely avoid guillotining the DNA-containing nucleoids\nindependently of the min system [11]. This \"nucleoid occlusion\" serves as a complementary control mechanism\nfor accurate cell division. The role of the min system appears to be to restrict the Z\u2013ring to midcell. This reduces\nthe production of inviable nucleoid\u2013free minicells which\noccur when the cell divides too close to the cell poles. If\nthe min system is genetically knocked out, 40% of divisions lead to inviable minicells [9] \u2013 a sizeable drain on\nbacterial resources.\nThe study of deletion mutants has made the phenomenological roles of the individual min proteins clear.\nMinC associated to the cytoplasmic membrane locally\ninhibits assembly of the contractile Z\u2013ring, but remains\ncytoplasmic and largely inactive in the absence of MinD\n[5]. MinD binds MinC and recruits it to the cytoplasmic membrane [5, 12]. MinE drives MinD away from\nthe bacterial midplane, and hence allows a contractile\nring to form only there. Without MinE, the membrane\u2013\nbound MinC/MinD block Z\u2013ring formation everywhere,\ninhibiting division, and resulting in the formation of long\nfilamentous cells [4, 6]. Without MinC, Z\u2013ring formation\ncannot be inhibited anywhere and inviable minicells are\nproduced. Without MinD, neither MinC nor MinE are\nrecruited to the cytoplasmic membrane and so have reduced effect.\nWith normal levels of MinC, D, and E, a remarkable\noscillatory dynamics is seen [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. First the\nMinC/MinD accumulate at one end of the bacterium on\nthe cytoplasmic membrane. Then MinE forms a band at\nmidcell which sweeps towards the cell pole occupied by\nthe MinC/MinD, ejecting the MinC/MinD into the cytoplasm as it goes. The ejected MinC/MinD then rebinds\nat the other end of the bacterium. When the MinE band\nreaches the cell pole, it disassociates and reforms at midcell. The entire process then repeats towards the opposite\ncell pole. The oscillation period is approximately 1 \u2212 2\nminutes, so many oscillations occur between each bacterial division. The dynamics minimizes the MinC/MinD\nconcentration at midcell, thereby allowing the Z\u2013ring and\n\n\f2\nthe subsequent division septum to form there.\nUntil recently [8], qualitative models of the min system\ninvolved unidentified midcell topological markers (see,\ne.g., [13]). This letter puts forward the first quantitative\nself\u2013organized model that describes much of the intricate phenomenology of accurate division site placement\nin E. coli, and does so using only the diffusive motion and\ninteractions of the min proteins. The essence of our approach is to describe the MinCDE dynamics by a set of\ncoupled reaction\u2013diffusion equations. Experimental results indicate that the oscillatory protein dynamics is\nunaffected if new protein synthesis is blocked [3]. Accordingly we employ a model that conserves the total number\nof each protein type. Strikingly, this model possesses a\nlinear Turing\u2013like (Hopf) instability [14, 15] despite the\nabsence of mechanisms such as internal reactant production or external feed that have normally been required\nto model Turing patterns [16]. [Of course energy input\nin the form of ATP is required to sustain the oscillations\nwithin a bacterium.] As we will see, the resulting protein oscillations mark the midcell with a minimum of the\ntime\u2013averaged concentration of MinC/MinD and with a\ncorresponding maximum of MinE.\nOur starting point is a set of four coupled reaction\u2013\ndiffusion equations describing, respectively, the densities\nof MinD on the cytoplasmic membrane (\u03c1d ), MinD in\nthe cytoplasm (\u03c1D ), MinE on the cytoplasmic membrane\n(\u03c1e ), and MinE in the cytoplasm (\u03c1E ):\n\u2202\u03c1D\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1d\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1E\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c1e\n\u2202t\n\n\u2202 2 \u03c1D\n\u03c31 \u03c1D\n\u2212\n+ \u03c32 \u03c1e \u03c1d\n2\n\u2202x\n1 + \u03c31\u2032 \u03c1e\n\u03c31 \u03c1D\n\u2212 \u03c32 \u03c1e \u03c1d\n=\n1 + \u03c31\u2032 \u03c1e\n\u2202 2 \u03c1E\n\u03c34 \u03c1e\n\u2212 \u03c33 \u03c1D \u03c1E +\n= DE\n2\n\u2202x\n1 + \u03c34\u2032 \u03c1D\n\u03c34 \u03c1e\n.\n=\n\u03c33 \u03c1D \u03c1E \u2212\n1 + \u03c34\u2032 \u03c1D\n= DD\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nFollowing the observation in Refs. [4, 5] that the MinC\ndynamics simply follows that of the MinD, we do not\nmodel the MinC field explicitly. We consider the variation of density along the long bacterial axis, tracking the\nlocal rates of change of the densities stemming from diffusion and from transfer between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. Zero flux \"closed\" boundary\nconditions are imposed at both ends of the bacterium.\nThe total amount of MinD and MinE, obtained by integrating \u03c1d + \u03c1D and \u03c1e + \u03c1E over the length of the\nbacterium, is explicitly conserved by our dynamics.\nBy reducing the min protein dynamics to a set of deterministic 1d rate equations we neglect fluctuation effects. Given that the number of min molecules in each\ncell is rather small (around 3000 for MinD [17] and 170 for\nMinE [18]) these fluctuations could be important. While\nsome fluctuation effects are evident experimentally, such\nas an occasional mid\u2013cycle reversal of the direction of\n\nMinE band propagation [8], on the whole bacterial oscillations appear to be amazingly regular [5]. Our continuum coarse\u2013grained approach captures the essence of the\nprotein dynamics and explains the self\u2013organized aspects\nof the MinCDE oscillations.\nIn the first reaction terms in Eqs. (1) and (2), \u03c31 describes the spontaneous association of MinD to the cytoplasmic membrane [6]. MinD is required to recruit MinE\nto the cytoplasmic membrane, but it is an open question whether it is cytoplasmic MinD or membrane\u2013bound\nMinD that is primarily active. A cytoplasmic interaction\nbetween MinD and MinE has been observed in Ref. [12],\nand we are currently only able to obtain the MinCDE\noscillations by allowing cytoplasmic MinD to recruit cytoplasmic MinE to the membrane, via \u03c33 in Eqs. (3) and\n(4). Once on the membrane, MinE drives MinD into\nthe cytoplasm. We represent this with \u03c32 in the second reaction terms in Eqs. (1) and (2). Finally, MinE\nwill spontaneously disassociate from the membrane, corresponding to \u03c34 in the second reaction terms in Eqs. (3)\nand (4). We have not included spontaneous MinD disassociation or spontaneous MinE association terms, since\nexperimentally MinE dominates the MinD disassociation\nand MinD dominates the MinE association.\nMany other reaction terms are possible, however we\nonly include the simplest possible \"renormalizations\" of\nthe basic recruitment and release terms, \u03c31\u2032 and \u03c34\u2032 . Effectively \u03c31\u2032 corresponds to membrane\u2013bound MinE suppressing the recruitment of MinD from the cytoplasm,\nand \u03c34\u2032 to cytoplasmic MinD suppressing the release of\nmembrane\u2013bound MinE. We have also set the diffusion\nconstants for the membrane\u2013bound MinD and MinE to\nzero. Our results are not qualitatively changed by using nonzero values, provided the membrane diffusion constants remain much less than their bulk counterparts.\nFor our simulations we discretized space and time with\nspacings of dx = 8 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bcm and dt = 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 s. We\nhave checked that our results are unchanged with smaller\ndx and dt. Densities are measured in molecules per micron, and unless otherwise stated we use average densities\nof 1500 \u03bcm\u22121 for MinD [17] and 85\u03bcm\u22121 for MinE [18].\nThe numerical values of our other parameters have not\nbeen experimentally determined for the min proteins. We\nchoose cytoplasmic diffusion constants slightly less than\nthe value 2.5 \u03bcm2 s\u22121 directly measured for a maltose\nbinding protein [19] within the E. coli cytoplasm. Unless otherwise mentioned we use a length of 2\u03bcm and\nthe following values for the parameters in Eqs. (1)-(4):\nDD = 0.28 \u03bcm2 /s, DE = 0.6 \u03bcm2 /s, \u03c31 = 20 s\u22121 ,\n\u03c31\u2032 = 0.028 \u03bcm, \u03c32 = 0.0063 \u03bcm/s, \u03c33 = 0.04 \u03bcm/s,\n\u03c34 = 0.8 s\u22121 , and \u03c34\u2032 = 0.027 \u03bcm.\nWe have analyzed the linear stability of Eqs. (1)-(4)\n[15]. Testing solutions of the form e\u03bbt+iqx with the above\nparameter values, we find a complex \u03bb(q) with a positive real part that is maximized for q \u2248 1.5\u03bcm\u22121 , where\n\u03bbmax = 0.010 \u00b1 0.043i. This indicates the presence of\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Space\u2013time plots of the total MinD (left) and MinE\n(right) densities. The greyscale runs from 0.0 to 2.0 times the\naverage density of MinD or MinE, respectively. The MinD\ndepletion from midcell and the MinE enhancement at midcell\nare immediately evident. Time increases from top to bottom,\nand the pattern repeats indefinitely as time increases. The\ngreyscale reference bar spans 100 sec. The horizontal scale\nspans the bacterial length (2 \u03bcm).\n\nSpace\u2013time plots of the MinD and MinE concentrations for a cell length of 2 \u03bcm are shown in Fig. 1. In\nexcellent agreement with the experimental results, the\nMinE spontaneously forms a single band at midcell which\nthen sweeps towards a cell pole, displacing the MinD,\nwhich then reforms at the opposite pole. Once the MinE\nband reaches the cell pole it disappears into the cytoplasm, only to reform at midcell where the process repeats but in the other half of the cell. These patterns are\nstable over at least 109 iterations (104 s) - long enough\nfor the min system to regulate cell division throughout\nthe division cycle of the cell. In Fig. 2, we plot the time\u2013\naveraged MinD and MinE densities as a function of position. MinD shows a pronounced dip in concentration\nclose to midcell, which allows for the removal of division\ninhibition at midcell. This is in qualitative agreement\n\nwith the experimental data of Ref. [8]. MinE peaks at\nmidcell, with a minimum at the cell extremities.\n\n<\u03c1(x)>/\u03c1max\n\na maximally linearly unstable oscillating mode with a\nwavelength of 4.2 \u03bcm and period of 145 s. This finding\nis confirmed by a direct numerical stability analysis of our\nmodel (not shown). The physical origin of this instability\nlies in the disparity between the membrane and cytoplasmic diffusion rates, and also in the slower rate at which\nMinE disassociates from the membrane. This ensures\nthat the MinE dynamics lags that of the MinD, setting\nup the oscillating patterns. The existence of the linear\ninstability in Eqs. (1)-(4) is crucial, since it means that\nthe oscillating pattern will spontaneously generate itself\nfrom a variety of initial conditions - including nearly\nhomogeneous ones. In our simulations we used random\ninitial conditions, although identical patterns were also\nobserved with asymmetric initial distributions of MinD\nand MinE. The eventual oscillating state is stabilized by\nthe nonlinearities in Eqs. (1)-(4). At the midcell, this\noscillating pattern has a minimum of the time\u2013averaged\nMinD concentration - an essential feature of division\nregulation - and a maximum of the time\u2013averaged MinE\nconcentration.\n\n1.00\n\n1.00\nMinD\n\nMinE\n\n0.75\n0.50\n0\n\n0.75\n\n1\nx (\u03bcm)\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\nx (\u03bcm)\n\n0.50\n2\n\nFIG. 2: The time-average MinD (left) and MinE (right) densities, h\u03c1(x)i/\u03c1max , relative to their respective time-average\nmaxima, as a function of position x (in \u03bcm) along the bacterium.\n\nWe also investigated longer filamentous bacteria and\nfound a multiple MinE band structure (not shown). Multiple MinE bands always combined into a single MinE\nband in cell lengths shorter than the natural wavelength\nindicated by linear stability analysis.\nThe oscillation period as a function of the average\nMinD concentration is shown in Fig. 3 (left). We find\na linear relationship indicated by the best\u2013fit line, where\nthe period approximately doubles as the MinD concentration is quadrupled. A linear relationship has also been\nsuggested experimentally [3]. The period of oscillation as\na function of cell length is shown in Fig. 3 (right). Below\nlengths of 1.2 \u03bcm the bacterium does not sustain oscillating patterns. For lengths above this minimum, the\noscillation patterns are stable and the period increases\nwith length - as observed experimentally [7]. The periods measured from our numerics for cell lengths of 2 \u03bcm\nare around 100 s, in good agreement with experiments,\nwhere periods from 30\u2212120 s have been found [3]. A single MinE band state is stable over a wide range of lengths\nfor a given density of min proteins. This provides strong\nevidence that the min system is capable of regulating accurate cell division over normally occurring cell lengths as\nthe cell grows between division events. At longer lengths\nof around 6 \u03bcm we observe long\u2013lived metastable states\nwith two MinE bands. These multiple bands can survive\nfor a thousand seconds or more before decaying into a\nsingle band. At still longer lengths the two band state\nappears stable; this occurs around 8.4 \u03bcm - twice the\ndominant wavelength given by the linear stability analysis. This explains why the characteristic wavelength of\nlinear stability analysis is rather longer than a normal\nE. Coli bacterium \u2013 if the length scale were smaller then\nmultiple MinE bands might occur in bacteria of normal\nlengths and proper division regulation would be inhibited.\nIf the MinD concentration is increased or decreased\nbeyond the limits shown in Fig. 3 (left), then the oscillation amplitude decays, and a uniform steady\u2013state results.

Although varying the MinE concentration does effect\nthe region of oscillatory instability (as shown in Fig. 4), it\ndid not have a significant effect on the oscillation period.\nThis appears somewhat contrary to the results of Ref. [3],\npossibly due to the absence of MinE dimerization in our\nmodel [20].\n\nquire that the membrane\u2013associated diffusion constants\nfor MinD and MinE are very much less than their corresponding values in the cytoplasm; and we have mapped\nout the shape of the oscillation regime as a function of\naverage MinD and MinE concentration.\nExperimental characterization of reaction rates and\ndiffusion constants do not yet severely constrain our\nmodel. Accurate experimental measurements of oscillation periods and wavelengths as a function of concentrations of MinD and MinE will provide a stringent test.\nThere is also considerable scope for extending our results.\nIn subsequent studies we will explore a bulk 3d system\nwith discrete particle dynamics and microscopic interactions between individual protein molecules. This will allow us to explicitly consider the influence of fluctuations\ndue to discrete particles, the role of ATPase activity of\nMinD [17], and the effects of MinE dimerization [20].\nThis work was supported financially by NSERC\nCanada.
