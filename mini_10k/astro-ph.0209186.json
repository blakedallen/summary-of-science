Introduction\nAccreting black holes radiate in the two main spectral states which we refer to\nlater as hard and soft (see Fig. 1). The hard state is characterized by a powerlaw\u2013like spectrum which abruptly cuts off at \u223c 100 keV. The energy output\nis dominated by the 100 keV photons [2]. Such a spectrum is interpreted as\nComptonization by thermal electrons in the inner hot disk or active magnetic\ncorona above the accretion disk (e.g. [3, 4, 5]). A weak MeV tail observed in Cyg\nX-1 is probably a signature of non-thermal electrons in the source [6, 7, 8].\nIn the soft state the emission is dominated by the black-body\u2013like component\npeaking at a few keV with a power-law\u2013like component above 30 keV extending\nup to 1 MeV or even higher [2, 8, 9, 10]. These spectra cannot be fitted with\nthermal Comptonization models and require the radiating electrons to have a\nsignificant non-thermal fraction [7, 11, 12].\n2. Spectral Modeling\n2.1. Cygnus X-1\n\nA weak MeV tail observed in Cyg X-1 in its hard state already shows us that\nthe emitting electrons cannot be purely thermal (see left panel of Fig. 2). An\nobvious generalization is to assume that there is a non-thermal tail in the electron\ndistribution that is produced by some acceleration process (e.g. [6]). The soft state\ndata (even below 1 MeV) could not be fitted at all with thermal models. Modeling\nof the spectral transitions with a generalized hybrid thermal/non-thermal model\neqpair [7, 13] predicted a stronger power-law\u2013like tail in the soft state extending\nup to 10 MeV. CGRO/COMPTEL observations confirmed the existence of this\ntail: the decrease of the hard X-ray luminosity was accompanied by the increase\nof the soft \u03b3-ray luminosity [8]. In the context of the hybrid Comptonization\nmodel, the power-law is a result of single Compton scattering off non-thermal\n\n\f2\n\nPoutanen & Zdziarski\n\nFigure 1.

A cutoff at about 10 MeV\n(depending on the compactness of the source) should appear in the spectrum due\nto the absorption of the \u03b3-rays by softer photons resulting in pair production.\n2.2. GRS 1915+105\n\nIn spite of the fact that microquasar GRS 1915+105 show dramatic variability\npattern, almost all its hard X-ray spectra are remarkably similar. During eight\n(out of nine) observations with the CGRO/OSSE the source showed a simple\npower-law\u2013like spectrum in the 50\u2013500 keV band with photon index \u0393 \u2248 3 [12].\nOnly in one occasion (when the X-ray flux was very high), the hard X-ray spec-\n\n\fRadiative Processes in Microquasars\n\n3\n\nFigure 3.

The solid curve is the total spectrum. The thin long-dashed curve\nshows the best-fit thermal Comptonization model, which lies much below the data above 100\nkeV. (b) The total model spectrum and the corresponding two components for the VP 813 data.\nThe cutoff at \u223c 10 MeV is due to photon-photon pair production absorption. From [12].\n\ntrum was much harder \u0393 \u2248 2.3 and the flux was low. We note here that in all\nobservations the source has a much softer spectrum than the normal hard state\nof Cyg X-1, i.e. it was always in the soft state. There is no signature of the highenergy cutoff in the data. The eqpair model gives a good description of the data\n(see Fig. 3) indicating that about 10-20% of the total power goes to accelerate\nnon-thermal electrons. The C/\u03c7-state [14] differs, however, from the B/\u03b3-state in\nthat the 20-200 keV tail is produced by thermal Comptonization in the former\nand by non-thermal Compton scattering in the later.\n3. Old and New Alternatives\n3.1. The \"standard\" model\n\nThe black body looking soft component is associated with the optically thick accretion disk by most of the researchers. The broad-band spectra are often fitted\nby the \"standard\" model consisting of a disk-blackbody (soft component) and\na power-law (hard). There are numerous problems with such modeling. First, a\nblack body is a bad representation of the spectrum expected from the accretion\ndisk (e.g. [15]). Real data also show that the soft bumps in the Cyg X-1 soft\nstate [11] and GRS 1915+105 [12] cannot be fitted by a black body (or multicolor disk). Thermal Comptonization of a blackbody is a much better description\nof these spectra. Second, a power-law, even exponentially folded, is a very bad\nrepresentation of the Comptonization spectra. At the lower end, Comptonization\n\n\f4\n\nPoutanen & Zdziarski\n\nspectrum cuts off below the seed photon energy while a power-law has no break\nthere. The normalization of the blackbody thus can be underestimated by a large\nfactor (see e.g. [16]). The conclusions (e.g. variations of the inner disk radius)\nresulting from fitting the data with this \"standard\" model thus should be taken\nwith a grain of salt.\nAt the higher end, the (thermal) Comptonization spectrum has a much sharper\ncutoff than an exponentially folded power-law. This difference in the spectral\nshape is important when we model the broad-band spectra from accreting black\nholes with the later model adding a Compton reflection component (model pexrav\n[17] from XSPEC) since the amplitude of the reflection component strongly depends on the assumed shape of the underlying continuum. Thus, we would advise\nnot to use pexrav when modeling Comptonization spectra close to the black\nbody or to the high energy cutoff.\n3.2. X-rays from the jet?\n\nA very interesting correlation between radio and X-ray fluxes has been discovered\nrecently [18, 19, 20]. There are two possible origins of this correlation. One is\nthat the level of X-ray emission is related to the rate of ejection of radio-emitting\nclouds, forming a compact jet (e.g., [19, 21]). Another is that the X-ray emission\nof black hole binaries is dominated by the synchrotron emission of the jet [22, 23].\nWe note here there are many strong arguments against the second interpretation. The broad-band X/\u03b3-ray spectra of black hole binaries in the hard state\nare very well modeled by thermal Comptonization and Compton reflection (e.g.,\n[24, 25, 26, 27]). The presence of reflection implies that the X-ray emission is\nnot strongly beamed away from the disk. The thermal-Compton origin of the\nprimary X-ray emission is strongly supported by a remarkable uniformity of the\nboth energy and shape of the high-energy cutoffs of black hole binaries in the hard\nstate observed by OSSE [10]. This cutoff is naturally accounted for by thermostatic properties of thermal Comptonization as well as e\u00b1 pair production (e.g.,\n[5]), as it corresponds to the transition to relativistic temperatures. At higher\ntemperatures, cooling becomes extremely efficient and copious pair production\nstarts. This reduces the energy available per particle leading to the temperature decrease. On the other hand, me c2 plays no particular role for non-thermal\nsynchrotron emission (cf. variable cutoff energy during flares in blazars). Thus,\naccounting for the observed cutoff energies requires fine-tuning of product of the\nsquare of the maximum electron energy and the magnetic field strength in the\nnon-thermal synchrotron models. In addition, the jet model has problems reproducing the actual shape of the cutoff. For example, the synchrotron model of the\nhard state of Cyg X-1 (see fig. 3a in [23]) when matched to the 100 keV flux\noverestimates the 1 MeV flux (see [8]) by a factor of 8.\nAn additional evidence against a substantial part of X-rays being non-thermal\nsynchrotron is provided by spectral variability. In the case of Cyg X-1, the\nASM/BATSE data show spectral pivoting around \u223c 40\u201350 keV (see [1] and\nFig. 4). The characteristic variations of the power-law slope \u2206\u0393 from those data\nis \u223c 0.2\u20130.3. This power-law spectral variability extended to 15 GHz would imply\na huge variability of the radio flux, by several orders of magnitude. However, the\nrange of the variability of the 15 GHz flux correlated with the ASM flux is by a\nfactor of several, basically the same as the range of the variability of the ASM\nflux itself [20]. If both radio and X-rays were due to non-thermal synchrotron\nemission, their observed variability pattern should yield the rms in X-rays virtually independent of energy. This is clearly in strong disagreement with the data\n\n\fRadiative Processes in Microquasars\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. Left: The rms variability in the hard state of Cyg X-1 in one-day averaged data from\nthe RXTE/ASM and CGRO/BATSE [1]. The model curve corresponds to a power-law pivoting\nwith \u2206\u0393 \u2243 0.2 around the energy which has a Gaussian distribution around 45 keV (see [28] for\ndetails).\nRight: Count rate during the two outbursts of Cyg X-1 on 1999 April 21 in the BATSE large area\ndetectors energy channels 1\u20133 (corresponding to approximately 20\u201350 keV, 50\u2013100 keV, 100\u2013300\nkeV). Count rates are higher in softer channels. The count rate is summed over two detectors\nclosest to the line of sight to Cyg X-1. Dashes, dots, and dash/dots show the background in\nchannels 1, 2, 3, as seen by two detectors looking away from Cyg X-1. From [32].\n\nshown in Fig. 4, and, in particular, with the ASM 1.5\u20133 keV flux being strongly\nanticorrelated with the 100\u2013300 keV flux from BATSE [1].\nThe amplitude of Compton reflection and the iron line imply that dense and\nrather cold material occupies a solid angle \u223c \u03c0 as viewed from the X-ray source.\nSmearing of these components and the observed correlations with the spectral\nslope [28, 29, 30] clearly identifies the reflector with the accretion disk and implies\nthe origin of the continuum emission within 30\u2013100 gravitational radii from the\nblack hole which would also be consistent with rapid X-ray variability. The above\narguments also rule out the dominant contribution of the nonthermal Compton\nemission [31] from the jet to the observed hard state spectra of black holes.\nAll these arguments strongly support the interpretation of the correlated radio\nemission as being due to ejection of clouds from the X-ray source which could\nbe similar to coronal mass ejections (CME) observed at the Sun. The recently\ndiscovered strong X/\u03b3-rays flares from Cyg X-1 [32, 33] could be the extremes\nof such an activity. The right panel in Fig. 4 shows the flaring activity of Cyg\nX-1 in April 1999. The episode D\u2013E shows strong flare in the 20\u2013100 keV band\nwith a weaker activity above 100 keV and no detectable signal above 300 keV.\nThis indicates that there exist at least two independent spectral components (see\n[32]): one could be related to the inner hot disk or the magnetized corona, while\nanother to the base of the jet.\n3.3. Bulk motion Comptonization\n\nThe power-law like spectra of black holes in the soft state were interpreted as\nresulting from bulk motion Comptonization in the converging flow [34, 35, 36].\nThe specific feature of that model is a cutoff at \u223c 100\u2013200 keV. (We note here\n\n\f6\n\nPoutanen & Zdziarski\n\nthat the XSPEC version of the model bmc has no cutoff built in.) The data show\nno signatures of the cutoff at least up to 500 keV in GRS 1915+105 [12] and up\nto 10 MeV in Cyg X-1 [8]. This supports their non-thermal origin and strongly\nrules out a significant contribution from the bulk motion Comptonization.
