For a quotient algebra U of the tensor algebra we give explicit conditions on its relations for U being a PBW-deformation of an\nN -Koszul algebra A. We show there is a one-to-one correspondence between such deformations and a class of A\u221e -structures on the Yoneda\nalgebra Ext\u2217A (k, k) of A. We compute the PBW-deformations of the\nalgebra whose relations are the anti-symmetrizers of degree N and also\nof cubic Artin-Schelter algebras.\n\nIntroduction\nIn this paper we consider a class of deformations of N -Koszul algebras,\nthe Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt(PBW)-deformations. The class of N -Koszul algebras was introduced by R. Berger in [3] and is a generalization of ordinary\nKoszul algebras. Let R be a subspace of homogeneous forms of degree N\nin the tensor algebra T (V ). Denoting by (R) the two-sided ideal in the\ntensor algebra generated by R we get the quotient algebra A = T (V )/(R).\nWhen certain nice homological conditions are imposed on the resolution of\nthe residue field k this is called an N -Koszul algebra, the quadratic case\nN = 2 giving ordinary Koszul algebras.\nBy deforming R to a space P of non-homogeneous forms of degree N\nbut keeping the homogeneous part of P of degree N fixed equal to R, we\nget a filtered algebra U = T (V )/(P ) which is a PBW-deformation of A\nif its associated graded algebra is A. (Note that U is augmented if the\nconstant term in P is zero.) In the quadratic case such deformations have\nbeen considered by Braverman and Gaitsgory in [2], a typical example being\nwhen A is the symmetric algebra on a vector space V and U the enveloping\nalgebra of a Lie algebra on V . We generalize their results to the setting of N Koszul algebras and give a simple set of equations relating the homogeneous\nparts of P which describes when U gives a PBW-deformation.\nIn [11], Positselski in the quadratic case showed that giving an augmented\nPBW-deformation of A is equivalent to giving the Koszul dual A! of A\nthe structure of a differential graded algebra. The Koszul dual A! may be\nidentified as the Yoneda algebra Ext\u2217A (k, k). In general for any augmented\nalgebra the Yoneda algebra has the structure of an A\u221e -algebra. For an\nN -Koszul algebra A it is natural to consider its Yoneda algebra B together\nwith this A\u221e -structure as its Koszul dual and Keller [8] computed this. We\nshow that when we specify a certain class of properties of A\u221e -structures of\nB, among them being that those products which are non-zero in the case\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\ncomputed by Keller are kept fixed, there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween such A\u221e -structures on B and augmented PBW-deformations of A.\nOur description is quite explicit. In fact the properties we can impose on B\nreduce the whole menagerie of equations to be verified for an A\u221e -algebra\nto only two simple types. We also verify that the A\u221e -structure on the\nYoneda algebra of U corresponds to, more precisely is quasi-isomorphic to,\nthe A\u221e -structure on B which we find.\nWe then proceed to compute PBW-deformations of some classes of concrete algebras. The most well known classical case is of course the PBWdeformations of the symmetric algebra S(V ). Such a deformation U corresponds to giving V the structure of a Lie algebra and U is then the enveloping\nalgebra of V . Here we consider the class of algebras\n(1)\n\nT (V )/(\u2227N V )\n\nwhose N -Koszulity was shown by Berger [3]. Note that when N = 2 we\nget the symmetric algebra S(V ). We compute the PBW-deformations of\nthese algebras. The result separates into two cases according to N being\neven or odd. When N is even, an augmented PBW-deformation of (1)\ncorresponds to giving a Lie algebra structure L : \u22272 V \u2192 V on V together\nwith additional structure provided by even symplectic forms \u03a62r : \u22272r V \u2192 k\nwhere 2 \u2264 2r < N , fulfilling analogues of the Jacobi identity, namely the\ncomposition (with some abuse of notation)\nL \u25e6 \u03a62r \u25e6 L : \u22272r+3 V \u2192 V\nis zero. Note that if we take \u03a60 = 1 this is the ordinary Jacobi identity.\nWhen N is odd a PBW-deformation of (1) is equivalent to freely choosing\na linear form l : V \u2192 k and symplectic forms \u03a62r as above. No relations\namong them is required.\nWe also consider the (generic forms of) cubic Artin-Schelter algebras and\ncompute their PBW-deformations. These are algebras that have considerable interest in non-commutative algebraic geometry.\nWe would like to give a quick comment about an aspect we have not\ndiscussed in this paper. Deformations of relations can be thought of as\nchanges to the Massey product structure. With this in mind, the results\nabout the A\u221e -structure can be seen as an explicit example of the interplay\nbetween Massey products and \u221e-structures. Also, the space of deformations\nwe construct will be the versal family of the moduli of such deformations.\nThis means that we don't consider equivalences of deformations, though the\nquotient by this equivalence relation gives the actual moduli. The moduli is\nin general difficult to understand, even in seemingly simple situations. For\nthe case of Lie algebras on a three-dimensional vector space (corresponding\nto PBW-deformations of k[x, y, z]), see [13].\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. Section 1 introduces N Koszul algebras and their PBW-deformations. We give the PBW-theorem\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nfor N -Koszul algebras which shows which equations must be fulfilled for the\nrelations P . In Section 2 we state how a PBW-deformation of A corresponds\nto an A\u221e -structure on its Yoneda algebra and Section 3 contains the main\nbulk of the proof of this.\nSections 4, 5, 6, and 7 are concerned with the PBW-deformations of the\nalgebra (1). In Section 4 we state the results. Sections 5 and 6 are of a\ntechnical nature and develop most of the ingredients of the proofs. The\nfinal proofs are given in Section 7.\nSection 8 contains explicit computations of the PBW-deformations of cubic Artin-Schelter algebras.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the Mittag-Leffler institute,\nwhich the first author visited during parts of, and the second author for the\nmajority of this work. We would also like to thank A. Laudal for interesting\nconversations on this subject.\n1. N -Koszul algebras and the PBW-theorem\n1.1. Definitions. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space, whose dimension we shall denote by v, over a field k. Let R be a subspace of V \u2297N where\nN is some integer \u2265 2, and (R) the two-sided ideal generated by R in the\ntensor algebra T (V ). We then get a homogeneous algebra A = T (V )/(R).\nIn [3], R. Berger introduced the notion of N -Koszul algebras which is a\ngeneralization of ordinary Koszul algebras (which is the case N = 2). The\nalgebra A is an N -Koszul algebra if the residue field k has a right A-module\nresolution of the form\nk \u2190 A \u2190 V1 \u2297 A(\u22121) \u2190 V2 \u2297 A(\u2212N ) \u2190 * * * \u2190 Vi \u2297 A(\u2212n(i)) \u2190 * * *\nwhere n(2q) = N q and n(2q + 1) = N q + 1. The Vi are vector spaces and\nhere and in the rest of the paper all tensor products are over k. We can\nalso define this notion using a resolution of k as a left module; these two\ndefinitions are then equivalent for a given algebra, see [3] Definition 2.10,\nand the following discussion.\nInstead of a homogeneous space of relations R we may consider a nonhomogeneous space of relations P in \u2295i\u2264N V \u2297i , and get a non-homogeneous\nalgebra U = T (V )/(P ). We shall be interested in the case when this algebra\nis a deformation of A of a particular kind, a PBW-deformation. We then\nassume that P intersects \u2295i\u2264N \u22121 V \u2297i trivially and that R is the image of P\nby the natural projection of \u2295i\u2264N V \u2297i to V \u2297N . Then there are linear maps\n\u03b1i\nR \u2212\u2192\nV \u2297N \u2212i such that we may write\n(2)\n\nP = {r + \u03b11 (r) + * * * + \u03b1N (r) | r \u2208 R}.\n\nThere is a natural filtration on the tensor algebra by letting F l T (V ) be\n\u2295i\u2264l V \u2297i . This induces a natural filtration F l U on the quotient algebra U ,\nand in the situation described there is a surjection\nA \u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192 gr U.\n\n\f4\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nWe say that U is a PBW-deformation of A if this map is an isomorphism.\nNotation. The symbol 1 will be used to denote the identity map on a\nvector space. If \u03c6 and \u03c8 are maps defined on subspaces U resp. W of V \u2297a\nresp. V \u2297b , denote\n[\u03c6, \u03c8] = \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c6\nwhich is defined on the subspace (U \u2297 W ) \u2229 (W \u2297 U ) of V \u2297a+b .\n1.2. The PBW-theorem. The topic of this paper is to investigate PBWdeformations of N -Koszul algebras. In the quadratic case this has been done\nin various papers, [2], [11], [10]. The following is a generalization of the main\ntheorem of [2] to the N -Koszul case.\nTheorem 1.1. Let A be an N -Koszul algebra. Then U defined by relations\n(2) is a PBW-deformation of A if and only if\n(P ) \u2229 F N T (V ) = P.\n\n(3)\n\nThis is more explicitly equivalent to the image of\n[1,\u03b11 ]\n\n(V \u2297 R) \u2229 (R \u2297 V ) \u2212\u2192 V \u2297N\n\n(4)\n\nbeing contained in R and (let \u03b1N +1 = 0)\n(5)\n\n\u03b1i \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] = [1, \u03b1i+1 ],\n\ni = 1, . . . , N\n\nExample 1.2. When the relations R are \u22272 V so \u03b11 is a map \u22272 V \u2192 V , and\nU is augmented, i.e. \u03b12 is zero, there is only one equation (5) and written\nout this is just the Jacobi identity meaning that \u03b11 gives V the structure of\na Lie algebra. Thus we have the classical PBW-theorem that U is a PBWdeformation of the symmetric algebra S(V ) iff U is the enveloping algebra\nof a Lie algebra.\nRemark 1.3. When U is a PBW-deformation (3), (4) and (5) still hold\nwithout the assumption that A is N -Koszul, as we now show in the first\npart of the proof.\nRemark 1.4. Berger and Ginzburg, [4], have independently proved this\nresult.\nProof of Thm. 1.1, first part. When U is a PBW-deformation of A, clearly\n(P ) \u2229 F N T (V ) is equal to P .\nLet x be in (V \u2297 R) \u2229 (R \u2297 V ). We get in the ideal (P ) two elements\nN\nX\n(1 \u2297 \u03b1i )(x) + x,\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n(\u03b1i \u2297 1)(x) + x\ni=1\n\nThe difference of these two elements is in (P ) \u2229 F N T (V ) which is P . This\ngives us the necessary relations degree by degree. For instance, in degree N\nwe have\n[1, \u03b11 ](x)\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nso this must be in R, and the degree N \u2212 1 part must be \u03b11 of this element,\nwhich gives us\n\u03b11 \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ](x) = [1, \u03b12 ](x)\nand so forth.\n\u0003\nThe second and difficult part of the proof will show how the conditions\n(4) and (5) of Theorem 1.1 imply that U is a PBW-deformation of A. For\nthis we need some deformation theory.\nL\n1.3. Deformations. We recall the setup from [2]. Let A = \u221e\nd=0 Ad be a\ngraded associative algebra over a field k. An ith level graded deformation\nof A is a graded k[t]/(ti+1 )-algebra Ai , free as a module over k[t]/(ti+1 ),\ntogether with an isomorphism Ai /tAi \u223c\n= A. By taking inverse limits, a\ngraded deformation of A is a graded k[[t]]-algebra At , free as a module over\nk[[t]], with an isomorphism At /tAt \u223c\n= A. In all cases considered in this\npaper, the deformations we construct are naturally defined also over k[t],\nwith the same conditions. Thus we can, for instance, take fibres over the\npoint t = 1.\nMore explicitly, an ith level deformation is given by a set of maps fj :\nA \u2297 A \u2192 A such that the rule\na \u00d7 b = ab +\n\ni\nX\n\nfj (a, b)tj\n\nj=1\n\ndefines an associative algebra, and similarly for the inverse limit, but with\nthe sum extended to infinity.\nLet C, C i denote the categories of graded deformations and graded ith\nlevel deformations of A, respectively (with morphisms only isomorphisms).\nThe connection between graded Hochschild cohomology groups and deformations is given by the next lemma, taken directly from [2].\n2 (A, A).\nLemma 1.5.\na. The set of isomorphism classes of C 1 is HH\u22121\nb. For Ai \u2208 C i , the obstruction to its extension to level i + 1 lies in\n3\nHH\u2212i\u22121\n(A, A).\nc. Furthermore, the set of isomorphism classes of such extensions is an\n2\nHH\u2212i\u22121\n(A, A)-homogeneous space.\n\nFor the proof, refer to [2].\n\u2022 (A, M ) be the complex of graded morphisms from the bar comWe let Cgr\nplex of A to the A-bimodule M , so that in particular the graded Hochschild\ncohomology groups appearing above are graded cohomology modules of this\ncomplex.\nFollowing Berger [3], there is a complex associated to an N -homogeneous\nalgebra A, called its N -Koszul complex. Its first few terms are\n\n\f6\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nK0 = A \u2297 A\nK1 = A \u2297 V \u2297 A\nK2 = A \u2297 R \u2297 A T\nK3 = A \u2297 ((V \u2297 R) (R \u2297 V )) \u2297 A\nIn general, the term Ki has lowest degree terms n(i), where n(2q) =\nN q and n(2q + 1) = N q + 1. For details, including the definition of the\ndifferential, consult [3].\nThe algebra A is N -Koszul iff this is a resolution of A as an A-bimodule.\nIn other words, there is a quasi-isomorphism from the Koszul complex to\nthe bar complex:\n\u03c3 : K\u2022 \u2192 B\u2022\nIt is injective since K\u2022 is a minimal resolution, see [3]. Note that this allows us to compute the graded Hochschild groups using maps from K\u2022 \u2192 A;\n\u2022 (A, A) = Hom(B , A) to Hom(K , A), which is\n\u03c3 induces a map from Cgr\n\u2022\n\u2022\nof course also a quasi-isomorphism. The differential we will be most interested in is the map Hom(K2 , A) \u2192 Hom(K3 , A). Given a bimodule map\n\u03b1 : K2 \u2192 A, its boundary d\u03b1 is given on (V \u2297 R) \u2229 (R \u2297 V ) as [1, \u03b1].\nLemma 1.6. Suppose A is N -Koszul. The graded Hochschild cohomology\ngroups HHji (A, M ) vanish whenever j < \u2212n(i) and M is a non-negatively\ngraded A-bimodule.\nThis can easily be deduced from [2] and [5]; in fact, in the spirit of [2], it\nmight be reasonable to use this as the definition of N -Koszulity.\nWe are now ready for the second part of the PBW-theorem.\nProof of Thm. 1.1, second part. The maps \u03b1i : R \u2192 V \u2297N \u2212i of vector spaces\nnaturally determine A \u2297 Ao -maps from K2 to A, which are denoted by the\nsame symbols.\n2 (A, A). ConTo get the first level deformation, we need a class in HH\u22121\ndition (4) from Theorem 1.1 states that the image of [1, \u03b11 ] is contained\nin R which is equivalent to d\u03b11 = 0 in the complex Hom(K\u2022 , A). It thus\n2 (A, A). We want to choose a representative\ndetermines a class [\u03b11 ] in HH\u22121\nfor this class, \u2212f1 , in the Hochschild complex, such that \u2212f1 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03b11 as\ncochains. Here, and later, it will always be possible to choose maps with the\ngiven properties because the map \u03c3 is determined by an (injective) map\nof vector spaces. So let \u2212f \u03031 be any representative; then \u2212f \u03031 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 \u03b11\nis cohomologically trivial, whence there exists \u03c9 in Hom(K1 , A)\u22121 with\n\u2212f \u03031 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 \u03b11 = d\u03c9. Let \u03c9 \u2032 be any Hochschild cochain such that \u03c9 \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03c9,\nand let f1 = f \u03031 + d\u03c9 \u2032 . Then\n\u2212f1 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u2212f \u03031 \u25e6 \u03c3 + d\u03c9 = \u03b11 .\nThe next steps of the deformation are constructed inductively. So suppose\nthe deformation has been constructed up to level i, meaning that we have\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\n2 (A, A) such that, for j \u2264 i, \u2212f \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03b1 and\nelements f1 , ..., fi in Cgr\nj\nj\n\n\u2212dfj = fj\u22121 \u25e6 [1, f1 ]\n(analogous to the properties of the \u03b1's from Theorem 1.1). Here f0 = 0.\nWe construct fi+1 with these properties as follows: Let\n\u2212f \u0303i+1 \u2208 C 2 (A, A)\u2212i\u22121\ngr\n\nbe any element such that \u2212f \u0303i+1 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03b1i+1 . Define\n\u03b3 = \u2212df \u0303i+1 \u2212 fi \u25e6 [1, f1 ].\nThen \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c3 = 0, and since \u03c3 is a quasi-isomorphism, \u03b3 is cohomologically\n2 (A, A)\n\u2032\ntrivial. So there exists \u03bc in Cgr\n\u2212i\u22121 with d\u03bc = \u03b3. Choose also \u03bc\n(easy diagram chase) such that \u03bc\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c3 and d\u03bc\u2032 = 0. Finally, set\nfi+1 = f \u0303i+1 + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 . Then\n\u2212dfi+1 = \u2212d(f \u0303i+1 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc\u2032 ) = \u03b3 + fi \u25e6 [1, f1 ] \u2212 \u03b3 + 0 = fi \u25e6 [1, f1 ]\nand\n\n\u2212fi+1 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u2212f \u0303i+1 \u2212 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c3 + \u03bc\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c3 = \u03b1i+1 .\nCompare this to the obstruction\ni\nX\n\nfj \u25e6 [1, fi\u2212j+1 ]\n\nj=1\n\nfor lifting the structure, coming from the general theory of deformations.\nAll the terms with j < i are cohomologically trivial, since the composition\nwith the quasi-isomorphism \u03c3 is zero for degree reasons. The only remaining term is covered by \u2212dfi+1 , as shown above, so the deformation can be\nextended to level i + 1.\nThis gives the deformation up to level N + 1. From there on, we use\nLemma 1.6, which states that the cohomology groups HHji (A, A) vanish for\nj < \u2212n(i). By Lemma 1.5, for i = 3 this says that the space where the\nobstruction to extending the deformation further than level N + 1 lives is\nzero. For i = 2 it says that the space of choices for this extension is zero.\nSo we have a collection of fi such that the rule\n\u221e\nX\nfi (a, b)ti\na \u00d7 b = ab \u2212\ni=1\n\ndefines an associative multiplication on an algebra fibred over k[t] (this works\nsince only finitely many terms are nonzero). Let \u0168 be the fibre over t = 1.\nSince it is constructed as a deformation, we know that gr \u0168 = A. We have a\ncanonical map \u03c6\u0303 : V \u2192 \u0168 which extends to a map \u03c6 : U \u2192 \u0168 (by definition\nof the fi ). We thus have a sequence of maps\np\n\ngr \u03c6\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nA \u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192 gr U \u2192 gr \u0168 \u2192 A\n\n\f8\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nand the composition is the identity on A. Thus p is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\nExample 1.7. It is easy to construct examples where the theorem fails for\nnon-Koszul algebras. For instance, let A be the commutative algebra\nA = k[x, y, z]/(y 2 \u2212 xz, xy, z 2 ).\n3 (A, A) 6= 0. It was considered in\nThis algebra is not Koszul; in fact HH\u22124\n[6]. Define \u03b11 by z 2 7\u2192 \u2212x, all other relations (including the commutators)\nbeing mapped to zero. Then [1, \u03b11 ] is identically zero, so the conditions\nof the theorem are trivially fulfilled. But the algebra U = k[x, y, z]/(y 2 \u2212\nxz, xy, z 2 + x) is finite dimensional as a vector space, so gr U cannot be\nisomorphic to the algebra A, which has Krull dimension 1.\n2. The A\u221e -structure on the Yoneda algebra\nFor any augmented algebra A the Yoneda algebra Ext\u2217A (k, k) has a natural\nA\u221e -structure, see [9]. Keller computed this structure when A is an N -Koszul\nalgebra. To state this we let W = V \u2217 and S be the perpendicular space of\nR, i.e. the kernel of W \u2297N \u2192 R\u2217 . Write A! = T (W )/(S) and let B be the\nalgebra with\nB2p = (A! )N p , B2p+1 = (A! )N p+1 .\nConsider k as a right A-module. Then B is the Yoneda algebra Ext\u2217A (k, k)\nof A as follows from the N -Koszul complex for A. (If k is considered as a\nleft A-module the Yoneda algebra will be the opposite algebra of B.) Keller\nshows, [8], that m2 is ordinary multiplication if some argument is even (in\nthe B-grading). When all arguments are odd then mN (b1 , . . . , bN ) is the\nordinary product b1 * * * bN in B. In all other cases the mp vanish.\nThe following states that an augmented PBW-deformation U of A corresponds to giving an A\u221e -structure on B with certain explicitly given properties.\nTheorem 2.1. There is a one-to-one correspondence between PBW-deformations of A (with \u03b1N = 0) and A\u221e -structures on B with the following\nproperties: i) mn vanishes for n > N , ii) mN is the ordinary product of\nN elements when all arguments are odd, iii) mn vanishes for 3 \u2264 n \u2264 N\nif some argument is even, and iv) m2 is ordinary multiplication when some\nargument is even.\nRemark 2.2. We see that the products in B which are non-zero in the\nnon-deformed case are unchanged in the deformed case. The only products\nthat we deform are the mp of odd arguments for p \u2264 N \u2212 1 and m1 of even\narguments.\nThe above A\u221e -structure on B corresponds to the natural A\u221e -structure\non the Yoneda algebra of U as the following shows. Recall that the bar\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\n\u2297n\n\nconstruction BU = \u2295n\u22650 U , where U is the kernel of U \u2192 k, comes with\na natural coalgebra structure, see [12].\nTheorem 2.3. Let C be the graded dual of B. There is a quasi-isomorphism\nC \u2192 BU of A\u221e -coalgebras.\nRemark 2.4. It might be conceivable that there are other A\u221e -structures\non B corresponding to a given PBW-deformation, since B is not in general\nminimal. But the above Theorem 2.1 shows that there is a unique one with\nthe above requirements.\nLet B ev = \u2295B2p be the even part of B, and B od = \u2295B2p+1 be the\nodd part of B. We shall reserve m1 to denote only the differential B od \u2192\nB ev . The differential B ev \u2192 B od shall be denoted by d. Also, if some\nargument of m2 is even, so m2 is ordinary multiplication we simply write *\nfor this multiplication or even drop it so we have the ordinary concatenation\nnotation.\nWith the requirement that mp vanishes when p \u2265 3 and some argument is\neven, the axioms to be checked for B to be an A\u221e -algebra, [7, 3.1] reduce to\nthe following two types, where p \u2265 0. When all arguments are odd (m0 = 0),\n(6)\n\nd \u25e6 mp+1 = (\u22121)p (1 * mp \u2212 mp * 1).\n\nLet u denote an even element and ai odd elements.\n(7)\n\nmp (. . . , ai\u22121 , uai , . . .)\n= mp (. . . , ai\u22121 u, ai , . . .) + (\u22121)p+1 mp+1 (. . . , ai\u22121 , d(u), ai , . . .).\n\n(If i = 1 then in the middle term u gives ordinary multiplication to the left\n\"outside\" mp , and similarly for the first term when i = p + 1.)\nRemark 2.5. An interesting thing here is that one realizes that this may\nbe abstracted to give the following construction of a class of A\u221e -algebras.\nLet B ev be a positively even graded algebra, and B od a module graded in\npositive odd degrees, with a derivation d and maps mp of degree 2 \u2212 p\nd\n\nB ev \u2212\u2192 B od ,\n\nmp\n\n(B od )\u2297p \u2212\u2192 B ev\n\nsuch that (6) and (7) hold. Then B = B ev \u2295 B od becomes an A\u221e -algebra.\nRemark 2.6. Note that when p = 1 both (6) and (7) are instances of\nthe derivation rule \u03b4(ab) = \u03b4(a)b + (\u22121)|a| a\u03b4(b). Hence they generalize this\nequation in different directions.\nWe shall now show how the A\u221e -structure on B determines a PBWdeformation.\n\n\f10\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1, the easy direction.

When all arguments are linear define mp to be the\nsign-adjusted dual\nmp = \u03c3(N \u2212 p)(\u03b1N \u2212p )\u2217 .\nSupposing mp+1 has been defined, we may then define\nmp\n\n(T (W )od )\u2297p \u2212\u2192 B ev\ninductively by equation (7) on the smallest integer i such that ai+1 , . . . , ap\nare all linear. Then let uai be a factorization with ai linear. We shall show\nthat this descends to a map (B od )\u2297p \u2192 B ev .\nIn the next section we shall prove that these definitions provide B with\nan A\u221e -structure. Assuming this we here provide the proof of Theorem 2.3.\n\u03c4\n\nProof Theorem 2.3. The map C \u2212\u2192 U which is the projection on C1 composed with the inclusion C1 = V \u0592\u2192 U is a (generalized) twisting cochain,\ni.e. we have\n\u221e\nX\n\u03bcU \u25e6 \u03c4 \u2297p \u25e6 (mp )\u2217 = 0\np=1\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\nwhere \u03bcU is the iterated multiplication on U .

As in [9], see also [8], in\norder to show that this is a quasi-isomorphism, it will be sufficient to show\nthat the twisted tensor product\nd\n\nd\n\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nC \u2297\u03c4 U = C0 \u2297 U \u2190\u2212\nC1 \u2297 U \u2190\u2212\n***\n\nis a resolution of k, where the differential d\u03c4 is given by\n\u221e\nX\n(1C \u2297 \u03bcU )(1C \u2297 \u03c4 \u2297p\u22121 \u2297 1U )((mp )\u2217 \u2297 1U ).\np=1\n\nBut the complex C \u2297\u03c4 U comes with a natural filtration (C \u2297\u03c4 U )\u2264p given\nby\nC0 \u2297 U\u2264p\n\u2190 C4 \u2297 U\u2264p\u22122N\n\n\u2190 C1 \u2297 U\u2264p\u22121 \u2190 C2 \u2297 U\u2264p\u2212N \u2190 C3 \u2297 U\u2264p\u2212N \u22121\n\u2190 *** .\n\nNow the \"non-deformed\" graded complex C \u2297\u03c40 A, where \u03c40 is the twisting\ncochain when U is specialized to A, is the Koszul complex for the N -Koszul\nalgebra A and is thus a resolution of k.

Since\nC \u2297\u03c4 U is the colimit of the (C \u2297\u03c4 U )\u2264p and this colimit commutes with\nhomology, we get that C \u2297\u03c4 U is a resolution of k.\n\u0003\n3.

Since W \u2297N \u2212\u2192 B3 is the dual of\n[1,\u03b11 ]\n\n(V \u2297 R) \u2229 (R \u2297 V ) \u2212\u2192 V \u2297N\nwe have the equation (when arguments are in W )\ndmN = (\u22121)N \u22121 (1 * mN \u22121 \u2212 mN \u22121 * 1).\nSumming up, we get (with arguments in W )\n(17)\n\nN\nX\n\n1\u2297i * dmN * 1\u2297N \u2212i = (\u22121)N \u22121 (mN \u22121 * 1\u2297N +1 \u2212 1\u2297N +1 * mN \u22121 ).\n\ni=0\n\nApplying this to an argument in the last term of (16) the right side of (17)\nbecomes zero in B5 = (A! )2N +1 and the left side reduces to\ndmN * mN + mN * dmN .\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nBut this is equal to d(mN \u2297 mN ) by the derivation property, and hence d\nvanishes on the last term of (16).\nWhen b = 2 then tensoring Eq.(11) to the right with W when m = N \u2212 1\nwe get\nW \u2297N \u22122 \u2297 S \u2297 W \u22972 \u2286 W \u2297N \u22121 \u2297 S \u2297 W + S \u2297 W \u2297N\nand hence d(W \u2297N \u22122 \u2297 S \u2297 W \u22972 ) is zero. In this way we may continue\ntensoring (11) to the right with powers of W and get inductively that\nd(V \u2297a \u2297 S \u2297 W \u2297b ) is zero.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.3. Equation (7) holds when i \u2264 p.\nProof. For the induction start note that it holds when p = N . Now if the aj\nare linear for j \u2265 i, Eq. (7) is just the definition. So let j \u2265 i be the least\nindex such that aj+1 , . . . , ap are all linear, but aj is not linear.\nSuppose first that j \u2265 i + 2 and let aj = vl where v is even (i.e. in W \u2297N q\nfor some q), and l is linear. The first term in Eq. (7) is then by definition\nequal to\n(18)\n\nmp (. . . , ai\u22121 , uai , . . . , aj\u22121 v, l, . . .)\n+(\u22121)p+1\n\nmp+1 (. . . , ai\u22121 , uai , . . . , aj\u22121 , d(v), l, . . .)\n\nThe second term in Eq.(7) is by definition\n(19)\n\nmp (. . . , ai\u22121 u, ai , . . . , aj\u22121 v, l, . . .)\n+(\u22121)p+1 mp+1 (. . . , ai\u22121 u, ai , . . . , aj\u22121 , d(v), l, . . .)\n\nand the third term in Eq. (7) is\n(20)\n\n(\u22121)p+1 mp+1 (. . . , ai\u22121 , d(u), ai , . . . , aj\u22121 v, l, . . .)\n\u2212\nmp+2 (. . . , ai\u22121 , d(u), ai , . . . , aj\u22121 , d(v), l, . . .).\n\nBy ascending induction on j (we'll take care of the initial cases j = i, i + 1\nshortly) and the induction assumptions, we may assume that (18) is\nmp (. . . , ai\u22121 u, ai , . . . , aj\u22121 v, l, . . .)\n+(\u22121)p+1\n\nmp+1 (. . . , ai\u22121 , d(u), ai , . . . , aj\u22121 v, l, . . .)\n\n+(\u22121)p+1\n\nmp+1 (. . . , ai\u22121 u, ai , . . . , aj\u22121 , d(v), l, . . .)\nmp+2 (. . . , ai\u22121 , d(u), ai , . . . , aj\u22121 , d(v), l, . . .)\n\n\u2212\n\nwhich is the sum of (19) and (20).\nWhen j = i + 1 the same type of argument goes through, assuming it is\nshown for j = i, and when j = i, an analogous argument goes through, this\ntime using d(uv) = d(u)v + ud(v).\n\u0003\nLemma 3.4. Equation (6) holds.\nProof. If all arguments are linear, this is simply the dual of the conditions\n(5) of Theorem 1.1. An odd argument which is not linear can be written (as\na sum of) mN (a1 , . . . , aN ) * aN +1 where the ai are odd elements. Suppose\nthe l + 1'th argument of Eq. (6) is of this form, where l \u2264 p.

By induction on the total\ndegree of the argument, the second term in (23) is equal to\n(\u22121)p mN * (1 * mp (1\u2297p ) \u2212 mp (1\u2297p ) * 1).\n\n(27)\n\nBut then again by using Eq. (7) and \"shifting successively to the right\", we\nsee that the last two terms in (21) become equal to the sum of (27) and the\nterms in (26) and (24).\n\u0003\nLemma 3.5.\np\nX\nmp+1 (1\u2297i \u2297 dmN \u2297 1\u2297p\u2212i ) = (\u22121)p (mN * mp \u2212 mp * mN )\n(28)\ni=0\n\nProof. According to Lemma 3.4 we can assume that the equation\ndmr+1 = (\u22121)r (1 * mr \u2212 mr * 1)\n\nholds for r \u2265 p. Assuming q \u2265 p + 1 and inserting this in the sum\nq\u22121\nX\n\nmq (1\u2297i \u2297 dmr+1 \u2297 1\u2297q\u22121\u2212i )\n\ni=0\n\nwe get, observing that many terms will cancel because of Eq.

We now start with the left hand side of (28)\nand apply this inductively. In the end this becomes\nX\n(29)\n(\u22121)\u03b7(a,b) (ma mb \u2212 mb ma )\na\u2265p+1,a+b=N +p\n\nwhere \u03b7(a, b) \u2261 \u03b7(b, a)(mod 2). Hence the terms in (29) cancel, except the\nterm\n(\u22121)p (mN * mp \u2212 mp * mN ).\nThis proves the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.6. Equation (7) holds when i = p + 1.\nProof. By the fact that Eq.(7) holds for i \u2264 p, and successively \"shifting\neven factors all the way to the right outside of mp \", we are reduced to prove\nthe i = p + 1 case when all the ai are linear. Also u may be written as\nmN (ap+1 , . . . , aN +p ) where these arguments are odd. The second term in\n(7), mp (. . . , ap u) will then, by successively \"shifting even terms all the way\nto the left and then outside of mp \", be equal to\np+1\n\na1 * * * aN mp (aN +1 , . . . , aN +p ) + (\u22121)\n\np+1\nX\n\nmp+1 (. . . , d(ai * * * ai+N \u22121 ), . . .).\n\ni=1\n\nBy the previous Lemma 3.5, this is equal to mp (a1 * * * ap )ap+1 * * * aN .\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.7. The map\nmp\n\n(T (W )od )\u2297p \u2212\u2192 B ev\ndescends to a map (B od )\u2297p \u2192 B ev .\nProof. We must show that mp becomes zero if one of its p arguments have\nthe form W \u2297a \u2297S\u2297W \u2297b . Using Eq.(7) and shifting even factors to the left or\nright outside of mp , this is easily reduced to the case when all arguments are\nlinear, except one which has the form W \u2297a \u2297S \u2297W \u2297b where a+b is N +1 or\n1. Suppose a = 0 (so b = 1) and that the non-linear argument is in position\np, the last one. We must show that mp vanishes on W \u2297p\u22121 \u2297 (S \u2297 W ). By\nLemma 3.1 this is contained in\nW \u2297p \u2297 S + \u2229pi=1 (W \u2297p\u2212i \u2297 S \u2297 W \u2297i )\nand hence W \u2297p\u22121 \u2297 (S \u2297 W ) is contained in\n(30)\n\n(W \u2297p\u22121 \u2297 S \u2297 W ) \u2229 (W \u2297p \u2297 S) + \u2229pi=1 (W \u2297p\u2212i \u2297 S \u2297 W \u2297i ).\n\nNow if the argument of mp is contained in the left term of (30), then mp\nvanishes on it by using Eq. (7) and \"shifting S to the right outside of mp \".\nIf the argument of mp is contained in the right term of (30) we may use Eq.\n(7) again and shift the argument of mp successively to the left. Note that all\nterms with mp+1 will vanish since d(S) is zero. In the second last step we\n\n\f16\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nare left with an argument in (S \u2297 W ) \u2297 W \u2297p\u22121 and in the last step we \"shift\nthe S-part to the left outside of mp \", and so mp vanishes on this argument.\nAssume now that it is the argument in position p \u2212 1 of mp that is contained in S \u2297 W . By Lemma 3.1, W \u2297p\u22122 \u2297 (S \u2297 W ) \u2297 W is equal to\n(W \u2297p\u22122 \u2297 (S \u2297 W ) \u2297 W ) \u2229 (W \u2297p\u22121 \u2297 (S \u2297 W ))\n\u2297p\u22121\u2212i\n+ \u2229p\u22121\n\u2297 (S \u2297 W ) \u2297 W \u2297i ).\ni=1 (W\n\nBy the former case mp vanishes on the first term and by the same kind of\nshift argument as above, it also vanishes on the second term. In this way\nwe may continue, and this settles the a = 0 case.\nThe case a = 1 and b = 0 may be reduced to the case just treated, by\nshifting the S-part one step to the right, using Eq. (7).\nSo suppose now 2 \u2264 a \u2264 N \u2212 1 and a + b = N + 1. Applying Lemma 3.1\nwith a = m \u2212 1 and tensoring Eq.(11) to the right with W \u2297b\u22121 , we derive\nW \u2297a \u2297 S \u2297 W \u2297b \u2286 W \u2297a+1 \u2297 S \u2297 W \u2297b\u22121 + S \u2297 W \u2297N +1 .\nSo by induction we get that mp vanishes when this is one of the arguments.\n\u0003\n4. PBW-deformations of T (V )/(\u2227N V ).\nIn [3], R. Berger showed that the algebra T (V )/(\u2227N V ), where \u2227N V is\nnaturally embedded in V \u2297N by\nX\nx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xN 7\u2192\n(\u22121)sgn(\u03c3) x\u03c3(1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 x\u03c3(N )\n\u03c3\u2208SN\n\nis an N-Koszul algebra (char k = 0). Theorem 1.1 therefore applies and\nwe shall use this to compute the possible \u03b1i 's for this algebra such that the\nassociated algebra U is of PBW-type.\nWhen N = 2 (and \u03b12 = 0) the classical PBW-theorem says that U is of\nPBW-type iff \u03b11 : \u22272 V \u2192 V is a Lie bracket. In the general case when N\nis even the result involves a Lie algebra together with symplectic forms of\nsuccessive even degrees and the Lie algebra is related to each form by an\nequation which can be viewed as generalizing the Jacobi identity.\nThe case N odd is distinct and simply involves choosing freely a linear\nform and successive symplectic forms of even degree. We shall now state\nthe main theorem, but first we explain some notation.\nNotation. 1. If we have a map\n(31)\n\n\u03c8 : \u2227p V \u2192 U\n\nthe domain may be considered as a quotient space of V \u2297p . Thus we get a\nmap which we denote by the same symbol\n(32)\n\n\u03c8 : V \u2297p \u2192 U.\n\nOn the other hand given map (32) then by restricting it to the subspace\n\u2227p V of the domain we get a map (31). We shall be free to switch back and\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\nforth like this. Thus if \u03c8 \u2032 : \u2227q V \u2192 U \u2032 is another map we may form \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032\nwhich we may consider as defined on \u2227p+q V . If we go from (31) to (32) and\nback to (31) again the new map will differ from the old by a constant, but\nonly in a few cases will it be of any importance to keep track of this.\n2. There is also a natural map\nT\n\na\nHomk (\u2227p V, \u2227r V ) \u2212\u2192\nHomk (\u2227a+p V, \u2227a+r V )\n\n(33)\n\ngiven by (arrange I, P and A in ascending order)\nX\nTa (\u03c6)(vI ) =\n(\u22121)sgn(A,P ) vA \u2227 \u03c6(vP ),\nI=A\u222aP\n\nwhere we sum over all partitions A\u222aP of I with P of cardinality p. The sign\nis the sign of the permutation we get by concatenating P with A. Given a\nmap \u03c6 we shall often by abuse of notation denote Ta (\u03c6) simply by \u03c6, like in\n(35) below.\n3. Let 1\u2297p denote the identity on V \u2297p . For a linear map L : V \u2297 V \u2192 V\nwe introduce the notation\nX\n1\u22972i1 \u2297 L\u2297j1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 1\u22972is \u2297 L\u2297js\n12a Lb =\nP\n\nil =a,\n\nP\n\njl =b\n\nwhich is a map from V \u22972a+2b to V \u22972a+b , and\na\n\u00b11 L\n\n= 1\u2297a \u2297 L \u2212 1\u2297a\u22121 \u2297 L \u2297 1 + * * * + (\u22121)a L \u2297 1\u2297a .\n\nNote that\n[1, 12c L] = \u00b112c+1 L.\nOn some occasions we will also allow L to be a linear map from V \u2297s to V\n(notably in Proposition 5.6).\nNow we shall consider PBW-deformations U of the algebra T (V )/(\u2227N V )\ngiven by linear maps \u03b1i : \u2227N V \u2192 V \u2297N \u2212i .\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose N is odd and dim V \u2265 N + 2. Let l : V \u2192 k be a\nlinear map and \u03a62r : \u22272r V \u2192 k arbitrary symplectic forms for 2 \u2264 2r < N .\nLet\n(34)\n\n\u03b12r = 1\u2297N \u22122r \u2297 \u03a62r\n\u03b12r+1 = 1\u2297N \u22122r\u22121 \u2297 l \u2297 \u03a62r\n\nThen these \u03b1i 's give an algebra U of PBW-type.

Then these\n\u03b1i give an algebra U of PBW-type. Conversely if U is of PBW-type and\n\u03b1N = 0, there exists L and \u03a62r such that the \u03b1i are of the form above.\nIf \u03b1N 6= 0, the U of PBW-type are obtained by also choosing a \u03a62n :\n2n\n\u2227 V \u2192 k such that the following composition is zero\n\u03a62n (1\u22972n\u22121 \u2297 L) : \u22272n+1 V \u2192 k.\nRemark 4.3. If the dimension of V is \u2264 N the \u03b1i may be chosen arbitrarily.\nRemark 4.4. The case when V has dimension N + 1 seems quite different\nand would have needed a separate treatment. So we do not consider it here.\nRemark 4.5. When N = 4 and \u03b14 = 0 we have given a Lie bracket L and a\nquadratic symplectic form \u03a62 such that the composition L \u25e6 \u03a62 \u25e6 L is zero.\nUp to coordinate change a quadratic symplectic form is given by its rank,\nan even number. For each such rank we thus get a class of Lie algebras.\nHaving stated the above results for the algebra T (V )/(\u2227N V ), one might\nwonder about what happens concerning PBW-deformations of the algebra\nT (V )/(S N (V )), the relations being the symmetric tensors of degree N . We\nstate the following without proof (the case N = 2 is well known for Clifford\nalgebras).\nTheorem 4.6. Consider the algebra T (V )/(S N (V )). To give linear maps\n\u03b1i\nS N (V ) \u2212\u2192\nV \u2297N \u2212i such that U is of PBW-type is equivalent to giving arbitrary symmetric forms \u03a6r : S r (V ) \u2192 k for r = 1, . . . , N . (The \u03b1i 's are then\ngiven by suitable expressions in these forms.)\nBefore embarking on the proofs of the theorems above we shall need auxiliary results.

For\nshort denote Homk (\u2227s V \u2032 , \u2227t V \u2032 ) by H(s, t). There is then a decomposition\nof Homk (\u2227p V, \u2227r V )\nH(p, r) \u2295 H(p, r \u2212 1) \u2295 H(p \u2212 1, r) \u2295 H(p \u2212 1, r \u2212 1)\nand a corresponding decomposition for Homk (\u2227a+p V, \u2227a+r V ).\nCheck that H(p, r \u2212 1) only maps to H(a + p, a + r \u2212 1). By induction\nthis map is injective. Also H(p \u2212 1, r) only maps to H(a + p \u2212 1, a + r)\nand so by induction is injective. The kernel of Ta is therefore contained\nin H(p, r) \u2295 H(p \u2212 1, r \u2212 1). Take note that this maps to the subspace\nH(a + p, a + r) \u2295 H(a + p \u2212 1, a + r \u2212 1).\nFor a subset I of {1, . . . , v} denote by eI the product \u2227i\u2208I ei . Now the\nmaps \u03c6P,R in Homk (\u2227p V \u2227r V ), sending eP toP\neR and all other eP \u2032 to zero,\nconstitute a basis for this space. Suppose then \u03b3P,R \u03c6P,R is in the kernel of\nTa . Let e be in P \\R. Then by what was said just above \u03b3P,R = 0. Similarly\nif we choose an e in R\\P . Hence if p 6= r we are done. WePmay therefore\nassume that p = r and that the kernel consists of elements\n\u03b3P,P \u03c6P,P .\nSo let I(p) be the subspace of Homk (\u2227p V, \u2227p V ) generated by \u03c6P,P . Then\nTa restricts to a map I(p) \u2192 I(p + a) which may be identified as follows. Let\nA be the commutative ring k[e1 , . . . , ev ]/(e21 , . . . , e2v ). We can identify I(p)\nwith Ap via eP 7\u2192 \u03c6P,P . If \u03c3a is the a'th elementary symmetric polynomial\nin the variables ei , then Ta can be identified with the map\n*\u03c3\n\na\nAp \u2212\u2192\nAa+p .\n\n\u0001\nNote that a!\u03c3a = (\u03c31 )a in A. Also \u03c3b * \u03c3a = a+b\na \u03c3a+b . To show that \u03c3a\nis injective it is therefore enough to show that \u03c3a+b is injective where the\ndimension of V is a + b + 2p. Replacing a with a + b and \u03c3a with \u03c3a+b we\nmay now assume the dimension of V to be a + 2p.\nLet I \u2032 (p) be the I(p) intersected with Homk (\u2227p V \u2032 , \u2227p V \u2032 ) and let\nA\u2032 = k[e1 , . . . , ev\u22121 ]/(e21 , . . . , e2v\u22121 )\nand so Ap = A\u2032p \u2295 ev * A\u2032p\u22121 . We are now left with showing that the map\nI \u2032 (p) \u2295 I \u2032 (p \u2212 1) \u2192 I \u2032 (a + p) \u2295 I \u2032 (a + p \u2212 1)\nwhich is the same as\nA\u2032p \u2295 ev A\u2032p\u22121\n\n\u03b1 0\n\u03b3 \u03b2\n\u2212\u2192 A\u2032a+p \u2295 ev A\u2032a+p\u22121\n!\n\n\u2032\n.\nis injective, where \u03b1 = \u03c3a\u2032 , \u03b2 = \u03c3a\u2032 and \u03b3 = ev \u03c3a\u22121\n\n\f20\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nSuppose f \u2295 ev g is in the kernel. This means \u03b2(ev g) = \u2212\u03b3(f ) and \u03b1(f ) =\n0. By induction \u03b3 is an isomorphism, so this says\n\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 \u25e6 \u03b2(ev g) = 0.\nBut\n\u03b1 = a!(\u03c31\u2032 )a , \u03b2 = a!(\u03c31\u2032 )a , \u03b3 = ev (a \u2212 1)!(\u03c31\u2032 )a\u22121 .\nSince \u03b2 is injective by induction we get \u03b3 \u22121 \u25e6 \u03b2 = a\u03c31\u2032 /ev and \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 \u25e6 \u03b2\nbecomes aa!(\u03c31\u2032 )a+1 /ev which is an isomorphism by induction on p. This\ndemonstrates the proposition.\n\u0003\n5.2. Conditions for 1 \u2297 \u03b1 to map to \u2227N V . Let E be the exterior algebra on the vector space V of dimension v. Let y0 , y1 , * * * , yj be linearly\nindependent elements in V and yJ = y1 \u2227 y2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 yj (not including y0 ).\nLemma 5.2. Let M be a homogeneous element in E such that M \u2227 yJ has\ndegree \u2264 v \u2212 2. If for every y in V , M \u2227 yJ \u2227 y has y0 as a factor (i.e. can\nbe written M \u2032 \u2227 y0 where M \u2032 may depend on y), then M \u2227 yJ = N \u2227 y0 \u2227 yJ\nfor a homogeneous element N .\nProof. Let {yi }\u222a{zk } be a basis for V . Write M \u2227yJ as N \u2227y0 \u2227yJ +N \u2032 \u2227yJ ,\nwhere N \u2032 is an expression in the zk 's. We then see that N \u2032 must be zero. \u0003\nNow we study maps \u03b1 : \u2227N V \u2192 V \u2297N \u2212s . We shall also consider the maps\nfrom the dual perspective. Let W = V \u2217 . Dualizing \u03b1 we get linear maps\n\u03b2\n\nW \u2297N \u2212s \u2212\u2192 \u2227N W.\nProposition 5.3. Let v \u2265 N + 2. Then the image of\n1\u2297\u03b1\n\n\u2227N +1 V \u2212\u2192 V \u2297N +1\u2212s\nis contained in \u2227N +1\u2212s V if and only if \u03b1 is 1\u2297N \u2212s \u2297 \u03a6 for some symplectic\nform \u03a6 : \u2227s V \u2192 k.\nProof. The image of 1 \u2297 \u03b1 is in \u2227N +1\u2212s V iff the expression\nx1 \u2227 \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s )\nis alternating under permutations of x1 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s . Let x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s be\nlinearly independent. We can then apply Lemma 5.2 as follows. First take\ny = x1 , y0 = x2 and j = 0. It follows that \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ) contains x2 as\na factor. Next let y = x1 , y0 = x3 , and y1 = x2 . It follows that x2 \u2227 x3 is a\nfactor. Thus we may proceed and get\n\u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ) = x2 \u2227 . . . \u2227 xN +1\u2212s \u2227 a\nfor some a (which a priori may depend on the x's). We also see that\n(38)\n\n\u03b2(x\u03c3(2) , . . . , x\u03c3(N +1\u2212s) ) = x\u03c3(2) \u2227 * * * \u2227 x\u03c3(N +1\u2212s) \u2227 a\n\nfor an arbitrary permutation \u03c3 of {2, . . . , N + 1 \u2212 s}.\nIf on the other hand x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s span a space of dimension N \u2212 s \u2212 1,\nadjoin an x1 linearly independent of these, and suppose if we omit xN +1\u2212s\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n21\n\nthe others span a space of dimension N \u2212 s. Then switching the first two\nelements\nx1 \u2227 \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ) = \u2212x2 \u2227 \u03b2(x1 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s )\n= \u2212x2 \u2227 x1 \u2227 x3 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xN +1\u2212s \u2227 a\u2032\n= 0.\nSince this is true for all x1 , we must have \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ) equal to\nzero. By descending induction on the dimension of the space spanned by\nthe arguments, we see that \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ) is zero when the elements are\ndependent.\nNow let x1 , . . . , xv be a basis for W . Let I and J be disjoint subsets of {1, . . . , v} of cardinalities N \u2212 s and s. Let I be {i1 , . . . , iN \u2212s }\nand I \u2032 be {i2 , . . . , iN \u2212s+1 } where also I \u2032 and J are disjoint. We now let\n\u03b2(xi1 , . . . , xiN\u2212s ), which we write \u03b2(xI ), contain the term cJ * xI \u2227 xJ . Since\nxi1 \u2227 \u03b2(xi2 , . . . , xiN+1\u2212s ) = (\u22121)N \u2212s * xiN+1\u2212s \u2227 \u03b2(xi1 , . . . , xiN\u2212s )\nwe get that \u03b2(xI \u2032 ) will contain the term cJ * xI \u2032 \u2227 xJ . By using (38) together\nwith this observation, we easily obtain\n\u03b2(xI ) = cJ * xI \u2227 xJ\nP\nfor arbitrary I which is disjoint from J. Letting F = J cJ * xJ , we have\n\u03b2(xI ) = xI \u2227 F for all I (where now repetitions in I is allowed). Letting \u03a6\nbe the dual of F we get \u03b1 equal to 1\u2297N \u2212s \u2297 \u03a6.\n\u0003\n5.3. Conditions for [1, \u03b1] to be zero. Now note that when R is \u2227N V\nthen (V \u2297 R) \u2229 (R \u2297 V ) is \u2227N +1 V by [3, Lemma 3.12]. Also note that if\n\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1i have been found, we can find a particular solution \u03b1i+1 to the\nequation\n\u03b1i \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] = [1, \u03b1i+1 ]\nof (5), and then add solutions of the homogeneous equation\n[1, \u03b1i+1 ] = 0.\nSo we want to find conditions on linear maps\n\u03b1\n\n\u2227N V \u2212\u2192 V \u2297N \u2212s .\nsuch that the induced map\n[1,\u03b1]\n\n\u2227N +1 V \u2212\u2192 V \u2297N \u2212s+1\nis zero. Considering this from the dual perspective, we have the dual of \u03b1\n\u03b2\n\nW \u2297N \u2212s \u2212\u2192 \u2227N W,\nand the dual of [1, \u03b1] is given by the map sending x1 * * * xN \u2212s+1 to\nx1 \u2227 \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN \u2212s+1 ) \u2212 \u03b2(x1 , . . . , xN \u2212s ) \u2227 xN \u2212s+1 .\n\n\f22\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nProposition 5.4.

Let \u03b4 be 0 or 1. The expression 1 \u2297 \u03b1 + (\u22121)s\u2212\u03b4 * \u03b1 \u2297 1 is zero iff\n(39)\n\nx1 \u2227 \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s )\n= (\u22121)s+1\u2212\u03b4 * \u03b2(x1 , . . . , xN \u2212s ) \u2227 xN +1\u2212s\n= (\u22121)N +s+1\u2212\u03b4 * xN +1\u2212s \u2227 \u03b2(x1 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s )\n\nShifting x1 , . . . , xN \u2212s , xN +1\u2212s cyclically N + 1 \u2212 s times gives\nx1 \u2227 \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ) = (\u22121)(N +1\u2212s)(N +1\u2212s\u2212\u03b4) * x1 \u2227 \u03b2(x2 , . . . , xN +1\u2212s ).\nHence if \u03b4 = 0 and N \u2212 s is even we get that \u03b2 must be zero.\nNow assume v \u2265 N + 2. The same argument as in Proposition 5.3 gives\n(assuming \u03b1 is in the kernel)\n\u03b2(x1 , . . . , xN \u2212s ) = x1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xN \u2212s \u2227 a\nfor some a (which a priori may depend on the x's). In particular if xi and\nxj are equal for some i < j then \u03b2(x1 , . . . , xN \u2212s ) is zero. But then \u03b2 factors\nthrough \u2227N \u2212s V so\n\u03b2(x\u03c3(1) , . . . , x\u03c3(N \u2212s) ) = x\u03c3(1) \u2227 * * * \u2227 x\u03c3(N \u2212s) \u2227 a\nfor any permutation \u03c3.\nAgain exactly the same argument as in Proposition 5.3 gives that there\nexists a form F of degree s such that \u03b2(xI ) is xI \u2227 F . Putting this into (39)\nwe see that it holds if \u03b4 is one.

We shall only prove the latter proposition since the former is similar\nbut easier. It is easy to see that if \u03b1 is 12p L, then {1, \u03b1} is in (40). We\ntherefore assume that {1, \u03b1} is in (40) and will show that it is of the form\n12p L.\nStep 1. Suppose first v = N + 2. Then (40) is naturally isomorphic to\nHom(\u2227s+1 V, V ). By Proposition 5.1 an isomorphism is given by\nTN\u2212s\n\nHom(\u2227s+1 V, V ) \u2212\u2192 Hom(\u2227N +1 V, \u2227N +1\u2212s V ).\nWe consider \u2227s+1 V as a quotient space of V \u2297s+1 and therefore this as the\ndomain of L.

The map TN \u2212s is then given by\nL 7\u2192 1/(s + 1)! * {1, 12p L}.\nThus if {1, \u03b1} is in (40) we get a form L in Hom(\u2227s+1 V, V ) such that\n{1, \u03b1 \u2212 1/(s + 1)! * 12p L}\nbecomes zero.

By\nextending this by zero in (41) we can consider it as a map in Hom(\u2227s+1 V, V )\nand subtract 12p L\u2032 from \u03b1. This new \u03b1 will map \u2227N V \u2032 to zero in V \u2032\u2297N \u2212s .\nStep 4. Consider the mapping to the third summand in (43). The image\nof the element \u03b1 comes from the third summand in (42). The map between\nthese two identifies as\nHom(\u2227N \u22121 V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297N \u2212s ) \u2192 Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297N +1\u2212s )\ngiven by\n\u03b3 7\u2192 1 \u2297 \u03b3 + (\u22121)s\u22121 * \u03b3 \u2297 1.\nBy induction this is in Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , \u2227N +1\u2212s V \u2032 ) iff \u03b3 is 12p L\u2032\u2032 for some L\u2032\u2032 in\nHom(\u2227s V \u2032 , V \u2032 ). Thus letting \u03b3 be the restriction of \u03b1 (to the third summand\nin (42)) and extending L\u2032\u2032 by zero in (41) we get a map in Hom(\u2227s+1 V, V ).\nWe subtract 12p L\u2032\u2032 from \u03b1. Now the components of \u03b1 in the first and third\nsummand in (42) become zero.\nStep 5. We now consider the mapping to the second summand in (43).\nThe image of the element \u03b1 in this summand comes from the second summand in (42). Let \u03b1 have component \u03b1i in Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297i \u2297e\u2297V \u2032\u2297j ) where\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n25\n\ni ranges from 0 to N \u2212s\u22121. The component of {1, \u03b1} in Hom(\u2227N +1 V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297a \u2297\ne \u2297 V \u2032\u2297b ) is then\n1 \u2297 \u03b1a\u22121 + (\u22121)s \u03b1a \u2297 1\n\n(44)\n\nIdentifying these spaces with Hom(\u2227N +1 V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297N \u2212s ) we wish that all the\n(44) be in the subspace Hom(\u2227N +1 V \u2032 , \u2227N \u2212s V \u2032 ) and that they are alternately\nequal in the sense that for 0 \u2264 a \u2264 N \u2212 s\n1 \u2297 \u03b1a + (\u22121)s * \u03b1a+1 \u2297 1 = \u2212(1 \u2297 \u03b1a\u22121 + (\u22121)s * \u03b1a \u2297 1)\nIn particular 1 \u2297 \u03b1N \u2212s\u22121 is in this subspace and so by Proposition 5.3 we\nhave \u03b1N \u2212s\u22121 equal to 1\u2297N \u2212s\u22121 \u2297 \u03a6\u2032 for a form \u03a6\u2032 in Hom(\u2227s+1 V \u2032 , k). But\nthen we see by Proposition 5.4 that \u03b1N \u2212s\u2212j is 1\u2297N \u2212s\u22121 \u2297 \u03a6\u2032 for j odd and\nzero when j is even.\nNow extend \u03a6\u2032 by zero in (41) to a map in Hom(\u2227s+1 V, V ). Note that\n12p \u03a6\u2032 is equal to p+1 times 1\u22972p \u2297\u03a6\u2032 . Replace \u03a6\u2032 by a multiple and subtract\n12p \u03a6\u2032 from \u03b1, giving us that its three first summands in (42) are zero.\nStep 6. We now consider the mapping to the fourth summand in (43).\nNote that the image of the element \u03b1 now exclusively comes from the fourth\nsummand in (42). Again let \u03b1 have component \u03b1i in\nHom(\u2227N \u22121 V \u2032 \u2227 e, V \u2032\u2297i \u2297 e \u2297 V \u2032\u2297j ) \u223c\n= Hom(\u2227N \u22121 V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297i \u2297 e \u2297 V \u2032\u2297j ).\nWe see that the component of {1, \u03b1} in\n(45)\n\nHom(\u2227N V \u2032 \u2227 e, V \u2032\u2297a \u2297 e \u2297 V \u2032\u2297b ) \u223c\n= Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297a \u2297 e \u2297 V \u2032\u2297b )\n\nbecomes\n(46)\n\n1 \u2297 \u03b1a\u22121 \u2212 (\u22121)s * \u03b1a \u2297 1.\n\nIdentifying again the right side of (45) with Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , V \u2032\u2297N \u2212s ) we wish\nthat the (46) shall be in Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , \u2227N \u2212s V \u2032 ) and be alternately equal. In\nparticular 1\u2297\u03b1N \u2212s\u22121 shall be in Hom(\u2227N V \u2032 , \u2227N \u2212s V \u2032 ). Proposition 5.3 then\ngives \u03b1N \u2212s\u22121 equal to 1\u2297N \u2212s\u22121 \u2297 \u03a6\u2032\u2032 for a form \u03a6\u2032\u2032 in Hom(\u2227s V \u2032 , k). But\nthen we see that \u03b1N \u2212s\u2212j is 1\u2297N \u2212s\u22121 \u2297 \u03a6\u2032\u2032 for j odd and zero when j is even.\nExtend \u03a6\u2032\u2032 by zero in (41) to a map in Hom(\u2227s+1 V, V ), replace it by a\nsuitable multiple, and subtract 12p \u03a6\u2032\u2032 from \u03b1. The result is that all components of \u03b1 in (42) are zero.\nStep 7. If some summand of \u03b1 lives in a Hom-term whose domain is \u2227N V \u2032\nand whose codomain involves two or more e's, then our hypothesis on the\nimage {1, \u03b1} says that this summand must map to zero. Using Proposition\n5.3 we easily deduce that this summand of \u03b1 must be zero.\nSimilarly we can argue for summands of \u03b1 living in a Hom-term whose\ndomain is \u2227N \u22121 V \u2032 \u2227 e and whose codomain involves two or more e's.\nThe upshot is now that the original \u03b1 is 12p L where L is L\u2032 + L\u2032\u2032 + \u03a6\u2032 +\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03a6 .\n\u0003\n\n\f26\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\n6.

The following will be useful in the\nproof of Theorem 4.2.\nLemma 6.1. For p \u2265 2 there is an exact sequence\ni\n\nj\n\n0 \u2192 \u2227p V \u2212\u2192 Ap \u2212\u2192 Sp (V ) \u2192 0\nwhere j is the natural quotient map and i is given by\n(47)\n\nxi1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 xip 7\u2192 xI \u2212 x\u03c3I\n\nfor an arbitrary odd permutation \u03c3.\nProof. Fix a basis x1 , . . . , xv for V . Let xI be a monomial in Ap . As noted\nxI = x\u03c3I for any even permutation \u03c3. If two indices ia and ib in I are equal,\n\u03c3I = \u03c3(a, b)I and so xI = x\u03c3I holds for all permutations.\nIn any multihomogeneous component of A of degree (b1 , . . . , bp ) , where\nsome bi \u2265 2, j therefore becomes an isomorphism. Clearly the elements\non the right in (47) are non-zero and linearly independent elements in the\nkernel when I varies over all increasing sequences of indices, and they also\ngenerate the kernel.\n\u0003\nThis lemma will be applied as follows. Suppose N is even and \u03c1 : \u2227N V \u2192\nV\nis a map where s is even. Then [1, \u03c1] applied to x1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xN +1 is\n(up to a nonzero constant)\nX\nxi \u03c1(xi+1 , . . . , xN +1 , x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 ) \u2212 \u03c1(xi+1 , . . . , xN +1 , x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 )xi .\n\u2297N \u2212s\n\ni\n\nThe crucial thing to note is that this is zero in AN +1\u2212s . Hence a necessary\ncondition for the equation of Theorem 1.1\n\u03b1s\u22121 \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] = [1, \u03b1s ]\nto be valid is that the image of the left side is zero in AN +1\u2212s .\nBefore taking on the proof of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 we need some extra\nlemmas to make the argument go smoother.\nIn the following let\nL : \u22272 V \u2192 V,\n\n\u03a62r : \u22272r V \u2192 k\n\nbe linear maps. We may consider them as maps from V \u22972 and V \u22972r respectively, by composition with the natural quotient maps.

Note first that\n1\u22972 \u2297 \u03a62r (1\u22972r\u22121 \u2297 L) = \u03a62r (1\u22972r\u22121 \u2297 L) \u2297 1\u22972\non \u22272r+3 V . Let M be a tensor monomial in L and 1\u22972 .

The first map in (50) identifies up to nonzero scalar as \u00b112r+1 L restricted to the subspace \u22272r+3 V of V \u22972r+3 The middle map in (50) identifies\nas 1\u22972 \u2297 \u03a62r up to a scalar.

Suppose L is a Lie bracket. Then\n(51)\n\n12a Lb \u25e6 [1, 12(a+b\u22121) L] = [1, 12(a\u22121) Lb+1 ].\n\n\f28\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\nProof. We use induction on a + b. The first of the terms in (51) can be\nwritten\n(52)\n\n12a Lb = 1\u22972 \u2297 12(a\u22121) Lb + L \u2297 12a Lb\u22121 .\n\nThe second of the terms in (51) can be written\n(53)\n\n1\u22972 \u2297 [1, 12(a+b\u22122) L] + [1, L] \u2297 1\u22972(a+b\u22121) .\n\nThe terms in (53) composed with the first term in (52) become by induction\n(54)\n\n1\u22972 \u2297 [1, 12(a\u22122) Lb+1 ] + [1, L] \u2297 12(a\u22121) Lb ,\n\nand the terms in (53) composed with the second term in (52) become (using\nthat L \u25e6 [1, L] is zero since L is a Lie bracket)\n(55)\n\nL \u2297 [1, 12(a\u22121) Lb ].\n\nThus the left side of equation (51) is the sum of (54) and (55) which is\n1\u22973 \u2297 12(a\u22122) Lb+1 \u2212 1\u22972 \u2297 12(a\u22122) Lb+1 \u2297 1\n+ 1 \u2297 L \u2297 12(a\u22121) Lb \u2212 L \u2297 12(a\u22121) Lb \u2297 1\nBy using (52) this is seen to be equal to the right side of (51).\n\n\u0003\n\n7. Proof of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2\nWe are now ready to give the proofs of the main theorems about PBWdeformations of T (V )/(\u2227N V ). First we do the case when N is even.\nProof of Theorem 4.2. Step 1. By Proposition 5.6, \u03b11 = 12(n\u22121) L. When\nN = 2 we know L is a Lie bracket. So assume N \u2265 4. The composition\n\u03b11 \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] is then\n12(n\u22121) L \u25e6 \u00b112n\u22121 L.\nWe do not yet know that L is a Lie bracket, but the same argument as in\nLemma 6.5 shows (or simply check it directly) that this is\nX\n(56)\n[1, 12(n\u22122) L2 ] +\n1\u22972a \u2297 L \u25e6 (1 \u2297 L \u2212 L \u2297 1) \u2297 1\u22972b .\na+b=n\u22121\n\nNow this is to be equal to [1, \u03b12 ] and so shall be zero in AN \u22121 of Lemma\n6.1. The first term is zero in AN \u22121 . The other term is 0 in S(V )N \u22121 ,\nseen as follows. Recall that we consider [1, \u03b11 ] on the subspace \u2227N +1 V of\nV \u2297N +1 , when a \u2265 1 just keep x\u03c3(3) . . . x\u03c3(N +1) fixed and switch x\u03c3(1) and\nx\u03c3(2) . Similarly we may argue when b \u2265 1. Hence the image in AN \u22121 of the\nsecond term lies naturally in \u2227N \u22121 V by the sequence of Lemma 6.1. In fact\nit is equal to a multiple of\nTN \u22122 (L \u25e6 (1 \u2297 L \u2212 L \u2297 1))\nwhich by Lemma 6.2 is a multiple of TN \u22122 (L\u25e6(1\u2297L)). Applying Proposition\n5.1 and noting that v \u2265 (N \u2212 2) + 3 + 1 we must have L \u25e6 (1 \u2297 L) equal to\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n29\n\nzero if (56) is zero in AN \u22121 . This is the Jacobi identity and so L is a Lie\nbracket.\nStep 2. We shall now proceed by induction on 2r, 2r + 1. Suppose \u03b12i has\nthe form (36) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r and that (35) holds for i < r. By the equivalence\nof Lemma 6.4 we have\nL \u2297 \u03a62i (\u00b112i\u22121 L) = 0\n\n(57)\n\nfor i < r. We shall show that \u03b12r+1 must have the form given. Since [1, \u03b11 ]\nis equal to \u00b112n\u22121 L we get by Lemma 6.5 that the composition of [1, \u03b11 ]\nand \u03b12r is the sum of terms\n(58)\n\nr\nX\n\n[1, 12(n\u22121\u22122r+i) L2r+1\u22122i ] \u2297 \u03a62i\n\ni=0\n\nand terms\n(59)\n\nr\nX\n\n12(n\u22122r+i) L2r\u22122i \u2297 \u03a62i (\u00b112i\u22121 L)\n\ni=1\n\nBy the induction hypothesis and Corollary 6.3 we get that all terms in (59)\nvanish except when i = r where we get\n(60)\n\n1\u22972n\u22122r \u2297 2r\u03a62r (1\u22972r\u22121 \u2297 L).\n\nNow let \u03b1\u20322r+1 be given by (37) in the statement of Theorem 4.2. Since\n1 \u2297 \u03a62i is equal to \u03a62i \u2297 1 on \u22272i+1 V and\n1 \u2297 \u03a62r (1\u22972r\u22121 \u2297 L) = \u2212\u03a62r (1\u22972r\u22121 \u2297 L) \u2297 1\non \u22272r+2 V we see that [1, \u03b1\u20322r+1 ] is equal to the composition of [1, \u03b11 ] and\n\u03b12r , the sum of (58) and (60). By Proposition 5.4.a we get \u03b12r+1 = \u03b1\u20322r+1 .\nStep 3.

If the sum of (61) and (62) is to\nbe equal to [1, \u03b12r+2 ] then it has to be zero in AN +1\u22122r\u22122 of Lemma 6.1.\nSince (61) vanishes there and (63) becomes zero in S(V )N +1\u22122r\u22122 we must\nhave (63) zero in \u2227N +1\u22122r\u22122 V . By Proposition 5.1, since v \u2265 (N \u2212 2r \u2212 2) +\n(2r + 3) + 1, we get (64). Then we see that (36) for \u03b12r+2 makes [1, \u03b12r+2 ]\nequal to the composition of [1, \u03b11 ] and \u03b12r+1 and by Proposition 5.4.b every\nsolution \u03b12r+2 has this form.\n\u0003\nNow we give the much easier proof of the case when N is odd.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. Proposition 5.5 gives \u03b11 is 1\u2297N \u22121 \u2297 l. Since l \u2297 1 =\n\u22121 \u2297 l on \u22272 V we get [1, \u03b11 ] equal to 1\u2297N \u2297 2l.\nNow if \u03b12r is given as 1\u2297N \u22122r \u2297 \u03a62r then \u03b12r \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] is\n1\u2297N \u22122r \u2297 2l \u2297 \u03a62r\n\n(65)\nOn the other hand if\n\n\u03b1\u20322r+1 = 1\u2297N \u22122r\u22121 \u2297 l \u2297 \u03a62r\nthen [1, \u03b1\u20322r+1 ] is given by (65) also. Proposition 5.4 gives \u03b12r+1 equal to\n\u03b1\u20322r+1 .\nLastly if \u03b12r+1 is given as in (34), then \u03b12r+1 \u25e6[1, \u03b11 ] is zero since l\u25e6(1\u2297l)\nvanishes on \u22272 V . Hence Proposition 5.4.b gives the form of \u03b12r+2 .\n\u0003\n8. PBW-deformations of cubic Artin-Schelter algebras.\nThis section is an extended example of Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt deformations of an interesting class of 3-Koszul algebras; the cubic Artin-Schelter\nalgebras. So we will present equations for these deformations for the generic\nforms of these algebras, as presented in [1]. We give the full details of the\nargument in one case, a semi-detailed description in one case, and as the\nother cases are similar, we simply present the results.\nThroughout this section, the vector space V of generators for our algebras will be two-dimensional, with basis x, y. The space of generators R\nwill also be two-dimensional, with basis f, g. The generators are cubic, so\nN = 3. Finally, in [1] it is proved that in all the situations considered here,\nthe vector space of syzygies is one-dimensional, and it has a generator w.\nWe use the conditions from Theorem 1.1 throughout.\nType E. From [1] we have that this algebra is generated by the two cubic\npolynomials\nf = y 3 + x3 , g = y 2 x + \u03b6yxy + \u03b6 2 xy 2 .\nHere \u03b6 is a primitive third root of unity. In our notation, R = (f, g), and\nthen (V \u2297 R) \u2229 (R \u2297 V ) is\n(w) = (y 3 x + \u03b6y 2 xy + \u03b6 2 yxy 2 + xy 3 + x4 ).\nWe define general maps \u03b11 : R \u2192 V \u2297 V , \u03b12 : R \u2192 V , and \u03b13 : R \u2192 k with\nparameters\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n31\n\n\u03b11 (f ) = a11 x \u2297 x + a12 x \u2297 y + a13 y \u2297 x + a14 y \u2297 y\n\u03b12 (f ) = a21 x + a22 y\n\u03b13 (f ) = a3 ,\nand \u03b1i (g) is given similarly with coefficients bij . Condition (4) can be written\n[1, \u03b1](w) = \u03b2f + \u03b3g,\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b3 are taken from the ground field. Now w can be written\nw = f x + \u03b6gy = xf + yg.\nThus\n\u03b2f + \u03b3g = x\u03b11 (f ) + y\u03b11 (g) \u2212 \u03b11 (f )x \u2212 \u03b6\u03b11 (g)y.\nBy comparing the coefficients of monomials in x and y, we get the following equations:\n(66)\n\nx3 :\n\n\u03b2 = a11 \u2212 a11\n\n(67)\n(68)\n\n2\n\nx y:\nxyx :\n\n0 = a12 \u2212 \u03b6b11\n0 = a13 \u2212 a12\n\n(69)\n\nxy 2 : \u03b3\u03b6 2 = a14 \u2212 \u03b6b12\n\n(70)\n(71)\n\nyx2 :\nyxy :\n\n0 = b11 \u2212 a13\n\u03b3\u03b6 = b12 \u2212 \u03b6b13\n\n(72)\n\ny2x :\n\n\u03b3 = b13 \u2212 a14\n\n(73)\n\ny3 :\n\n\u03b2 = b14 \u2212 \u03b6b14 .\n\nNow (66) gives \u03b2 = 0, and therefore (73) gives b14 = 0. (67), (68) and (70)\ngive b11 = a12 = a13 = 0, whereas (69), (71) and (72) give b12 + b13 = 0, and\nthen the same three equations easily give b12 = \u03b3\u03b6/(1+\u03b6), b13 = \u2212\u03b3\u03b6/(1+\u03b6)\nand a14 = \u03b3(1 + 2\u03b6 2 )/(\u03b6 + 1).\nCondition (5) gives \u03b11 \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] = [1, \u03b12 ]. We write out the coefficients as\nabove, using the fact that \u03b2 has to be zero:\n\u03b3\u03b11 (g) = x\u03b12 (f ) + y\u03b12 (g) \u2212 \u03b12 (f )x \u2212 \u03b6\u03b12 (g)y\ngiving the equations\n(74)\n(75)\n(76)\n\nx2 :\n0 = a21 \u2212 a21\nxy : \u03b3b12 = a22 \u2212 \u03b6b21\nyx : \u03b3b13 = b21 \u2212 a22\n\n(77)\n\ny2 :\n\n0 = b22 \u2212 \u03b6b22 .\n\nFrom (77) we get that b22 = 0, from (75) and (76), using also b12 + b13 ,\nwe get b21 = 0. From (75) and the computation for b12 above, we get\n\n\f32\n\nGUNNAR FL\u00d8YSTAD AND JON EIVIND VATNE\n\na22 = \u03b3 2 \u03b6/(1 + \u03b6).\nCondition (5) also gives that \u03b12 \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] = [1, \u03b13 ]. Going about as above,\nwe find equations\n(78)\n(79)\n\nx : 0 = a3 \u2212 a3\ny : 0 = b3 \u2212 \u03b6b3 .\n\nThis gives b3 = 0. Finally \u03b13 \u25e6 [1, \u03b11 ] = 0 gives 0 = \u03b2a3 + \u03b3b3 , which we\nalready knew.\nThere are no restrictions on a11 , a21 and a3 , and all the other coefficients\nare zero or expressed in terms of \u03b3.

With notation as in the previous example, we get from [1] that\nf = \u2212\u03b6 3 y 3 + \u03b6 2 yx2 + \u03b6xyx + x2 y,\n\ng = y 2 x \u2212 \u03b6yxy + \u03b6 2 xy 2 + \u03b6 3 x3 .\n\nHere \u03b6 is a primitive eighth root of unity.

Note that\nw = xf + yg = \u03b6f x \u2212 \u03b6gy.\nFrom condition (4) we get\nx\u03b11 (f ) + y\u03b11 (g) \u2212 \u03b6\u03b11 (f )x + \u03b6\u03b11 (g) = \u03b2f + \u03b3g.\nSimilarly, from (5) we get\n\u03b11 (\u03b2f + \u03b3g) = x\u03b12 (f ) + y\u03b12 (g) \u2212 \u03b6\u03b12 (f )x + \u03b6\u03b12 (g)y,\n\u03b12 (\u03b2f + \u03b3g) = x\u03b13 (f ) + y\u03b13 (g) \u2212 \u03b6\u03b13 (f )x + \u03b6\u03b13 (g)y,\n\u03b13 (\u03b2f + \u03b3g) = 0.\nAs before, by rewriting these equations monomial by monomial, we end\nup with expressing the a's and b's in terms of \u03b2 and \u03b3. These expressions\nare linear for the a1i , quadratic for the a2i , cubic for a3 and similarly for the\nb's. In addition, there is one quartic relation between \u03b3 and \u03b2, which turns\nout to be trivially fulfilled.\n\n\fPBW-DEFORMATIONS OF N-KOSZUL ALGEBRAS\n\n33\n\nWe get the following expressions for the coefficients, expressed in terms\nof \u03b3 and \u03b2 (calculated in Maple, valid in characteristic different from 2):\na11 = 1/2\u03b3(\u03b6 3 \u2212 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 1)\na12 = \u22121/2\u03b2(3\u03b6 3 + 3\u03b6 2 + 3\u03b6 + 1)\na13 = \u22121/2\u03b2(3\u03b6 3 + 3\u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 3)\na14 = 3/2\u03b3(\u03b6 3 + \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6 + 1)\na21 = \u03b3\u03b2\u03b6(\u03b6 2 + 2\u03b6 + 1)\na22 = 3/2\u03b2 2 \u03b6 3 \u2212 3/2\u03b6\u03b2 2 \u2212 2\u03b2 2 + 3/2\u03b3 2 \u03b6 3 \u2212 3\u03b3 2 \u03b6 2 + 3/2\u03b3 2 \u03b6\na3 = \u22121/2\u03b3(2\u03b2 2 \u03b6 3 + 2\u03b3 2 \u03b6 3 + \u03b2 2 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u03b6 \u2212 2\u03b2 2 + 2\u03b3 2 )\nb11 = \u22123/2\u03b2(\u03b6 3 \u2212 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 1)\nb12 = 1/2\u03b3(3\u03b6 3 \u2212 3\u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6 + 3)\nb13 = 1/2\u03b3(3\u03b6 3 \u2212 3\u03b6 2 + 3\u03b6 \u2212 1)\nb14 = \u22121/2\u03b2(\u03b6 3 + \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6 + 1)\nb21 = \u22123/2\u03b2 2 \u03b6 3 \u2212 3\u03b2 2 \u03b6 2 + 3/2\u03b3 2 \u03b6 \u2212 3/2\u03b3 2 \u03b6 3 \u2212 2\u03b3 2 \u2212 3/2\u03b6\u03b2 2\nb22 = \u2212\u03b3\u03b2\u03b6(\u03b6 2 \u2212 2\u03b6 + 1)\nb3 = 1/2\u03b2(2\u03b2 2 \u03b6 3 + 2\u03b3 2 \u03b6 3 + \u03b2 2 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u03b6 \u2212 2\u03b2 2 + 2\u03b3 2 )\nWe introduce the other cases by giving the generators f, g of the ideal,\nand w, a generator for (V \u2297R)\u2229(R\u2297V ).
