Introduction\nThermodynamics of strongly interacting matter has been explored numerically within Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) [1, 2, 3, 4] as well as\nexperimentally in heavy-ion collisions [5]. The fundamental goal of these studies is to reveal the structure of the QCD phase diagram and to investigate the\ncritical properties of QCD.\nLQCD results show that at finite temperatures QCD exhibits restoration\nof chiral symmetry and deconfinement in a crossover transition. The LQCD\nequation of state indicates a clear separation between the confined hadronic\nphase and the deconfined quark\u2013gluon plasma. The temperature separation of\nthe phases of QCD is very transparent when one considers fluctuations of conserved charges [2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. At vanishing chemical potential the variance\nof both the net baryon number and the electric charge exhibits a rapid change\nin a narrow temperature interval. This behavior is attributed to the deconfinement of quarks [11, 12, 13]. On the other hand, the fourth order cumulants of\n\nPreprint submitted to Physics Letters B\n\nNovember 25, 2018\n\n\fthese charges show peak-like structures, whereas the sixth order cumulants are\nnegative in a narrow temperature interval [6].\nThese properties of the fluctuations observed in LQCD at finite temperature\nand for small masses of the up\u2013 and down\u2013quarks can be attributed to the\ncritical dynamics of the explicitly broken chiral symmetry, which is characterized\nby the O(4) universality class of QCD [6, 14]. As noted in [14, 15], this could have\ninteresting phenomenological implications: it has been suggested, that the sixth\nand eight order cumulants of the net baryon number and electric charge may\nallow an experimental verification of the chiral crossover transition in heavy-ion\ncollisions [15].\nThe critical behavior of strongly interacting matter related with chiral dynamics should be common to all models which exhibit the underlying chiral\nsymmetry of QCD and the same patterns of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature. Thus, such effective models have been used to study\nthe thermodynamics near the chiral phase transition and to explore observables\nwhich are sensitive to the critical behavior [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In this\ncontext, models which include the coupling of quarks to an effective gluon field,\nsuch as the Polyakov loop extended Nambu\u2013Jona\u2013Lasinio (PNJL) [18, 21] and\nthe quark\u2013meson (PQM) [24] models, are very useful. Both models reproduce\nthe essential features of the QCD thermodynamics already in the mean-field\napproximation [16, 17, 18, 19, 21]. However, to correctly account for the critical dynamics, it is necessary to go beyond the mean-field approximation and\ninclude non-perturbative fluctuations. This can be achieved e.g. by employing\nmethods based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) [25, 26, 27, 28].\nThe FRG has been applied to study the fluctuations of the net baryon number\nnear the chiral phase transition at finite and at vanishing baryon chemical potential [14, 29, 11, 13, 30]. However, so far such studies are not available for the\nelectric charge fluctuations.\nIn this work, we study fluctuations of the electric charge near the chiral phase\ntransition at finite temperature and at vanishing chemical potential within the\nFRG approach to the linear sigma and PQM models. We explore the temperature dependence of these fluctuations and the role of quantum statistics.\nFurthermore, the influence of quark- and gluon-dynamics on the properties of\nthe electric charge fluctuations near the chiral crossover transition, including the\neffect of mesonic fluctuations, is discussed. We find a strong sensitivity of higher\norder cumulants of the electric charge to chiral symmetry breaking and deconfinemenet. We also show, that these cumulants exhibit a characteristic O(4)\nstructure, similar to that found in the fluctuations of the net baryon charge. In\nparticular, the cumulants turn negative in the vicinity of the chiral transition\nalso at vanishing net charge.\nIn the subsequent section we introduce the non-perturbative thermodynamic\npotential in the FRG approach to the PQM model formulated at finite electriccharge chemical potential. In section 3 we present our results on fluctuations of\nthe electric charge, including higher cumulants, in the linear sigma and PQM\nmodels. Finally, in section 4 we present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\n\f2. The thermodynamic potential in the Polyakov-quark-meson model\nThe quark\u2013meson model is an effective realization of the low\u2013energy sector of QCD, which incorporates chiral symmetry and exhibits a global SU (Nc )\ncolor symmetry. Hence, it does not describe quark confinement. Nevertheless, by introducing a coupling of the quarks to a uniform temporal color gauge\nfield, represented by the Polyakov loop, one obtains an equation of state with\nproperties that closely resemble those of QCD matter, including a change of\neffective degrees of freedom with increasing temperature, thus mimicking the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition [17, 19, 21, 24]. This is sometimes referred to a statistical confinement.\nA formulation of the thermodynamics of the PQM model, which remains\nvalid near the chiral phase transition, requires the use of non-perturbative methods. In an analysis of electric charge fluctuations, it is of particular importance\nto account for mesonic fluctuations, including specifically interacting pions as\ncarriers of electric charge. We employ a method based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) to compute the thermodynamic potential in the PQM\nmodel. This method involves an infrared regularization of the fluctuations at\na sliding momentum scale k, resulting in a scale-dependent effective action \u0393k\n[25, 26, 27, 28]. We treat the Polyakov loop as a background field, which is\nintroduced self-consistently on the mean-field level while the quark and meson\nfields, fluctuations are accounted for by solving the FRG flow equations.\nWe follow the procedure used in Ref. [29] in the formulation of the flow equation for the scale-dependent grand canonical potential density, \u03a9k = T \u0393k /V , for\nthe quark and meson subsystems at finite temperature and for a non-vanishing\nelectric charge chemical potential.

The initial conditions for the flow are\nchosen to reproduce the following vacuum properties: the physical pion mass\nm\u03c0 = 138 MeV, the pion decay constant f\u03c0 = 93 MeV, the sigma mass m\u03c3 =\n600 MeV, and the constituent quark mass mq = 300 MeV at the scale k \u2192 0.\nThe symmetry breaking term, c = m2\u03c0 f\u03c0 , is treated as an external field which\ndoes not flow. The flow of the Yukawa coupling g is neglected because it is not\nexpected to be significant for the present studies (see e.g. Refs. [31]).\nBy solving Eq. (1) one obtains the thermodynamic potential \u03a9k\u21920 (l, l\u2217 ; T, \u03bc)\nas a function of the Polyakov loop variables l and l\u2217 . The full thermodynamic\npotential \u03a9(l, l\u2217 ; T, \u03bc) in the PQM model, including quark, meson and gluon\ndegrees of freedom, is obtained by adding the effective gluon potential U(l, l\u2217 ),\n\u03a9(l, l\u2217 ; T, \u03bc) = \u03a9k\u21920 (l, l\u2217 ; T, \u03bc) + U(l, l\u2217 ).\n\n(7)\n\nAt a given temperature and chemical potential, the Polyakov loop variables, l\nand l\u2217 , are then determined by the stationarity conditions:\n\u2202\n\u03a9(l, l\u2217 ; T, \u03bc) = 0.\n\u2202l\u2217\n\n\u2202\n\u03a9(l, l\u2217 ; T, \u03bc) = 0,\n\u2202l\n\n(8)\n\nThe thermodynamic potential (7) does not contain contributions of thermal\nmodes with momenta larger than the cutoff \u039b. In order to obtain the correct\nhigh-temperature behavior of the thermodynamic functions, we supplement the\nFRG potential with the contribution of the high-momentum states. A procedure\nfor implementing this was proposed in Ref. [32] for the QM model and extended\nto the PQM model in Ref. [29], by including the flow of quarks interacting with\nthe Polyakov loop for momenta k > \u039b.\n4\n\n\f3. Electric charge density fluctuations\nThe thermodynamic potential obtained by solving the flow equation (1) correctly reproduces the critical O(4) scaling near the chiral phase transition. Thus,\nusing this potential one can compute the temperature dependence of the electric\ncharge fluctuations and their higher cumulants.\nThe fluctuations of the electric charge are characterized by the generalized\nsusceptibilities,\n\u2202 n [p (T, \u03bcQ )/T 4 ]\n\u03c7Q\n.\n(9)\nn (T ) =\n\u2202(\u03bcQ /T )n\n3\nThe first cumulant, \u03c7Q\n1 = nQ /T , is given by the electric charge density nQ =\nNQ /V , while the second cumulant\n\n\u03c7Q\n2 =\n\n1\nh(\u03b4NQ )2 i\nV T3\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b4NQ = NQ \u2212 hNQ i, is proportional to the variance of the electric charge.\nFurthermore, the fourth and sixth order cumulants can be expressed through\nmoments of \u03b4NQ\n\u03c7Q\n4\n\n=\n\n\u03c7Q\n6\n\n=\n+\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nh(\u03b4NQ )4 i \u2212 3h(\u03b4NQ )2 i2 ,\n3\nVT\n1 \u0002\nh(\u03b4NQ )6 i \u2212 15h(\u03b4NQ )4 ih(\u03b4NQ )2 i \u2212 10h(\u03b4NQ )3 i2\nV T3\n\u0003\n30h(\u03b4NQ )2 i3 .\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nBased on LQCD results [33], one expects that in the region of the crossover\ntransition, the fluctuations of the electric charge should reflect the critical scaling of the underlying O(4) symmetry. For the O(4) universality class, the singular part of thermodynamic pressure, at small values of the baryon chemical\npotential, scales as\np \u221d (T /Tc \u2212 1 + \u03ba\u03bc2B )2\u2212\u03b1 ,\n(13)\nwhere Tc is the temperature of the second-order phase transition at \u03bc = 0 in\nthe chiral limit. The exponent \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.21 is the critical exponent of the specific\nheat in the O(4) universality class in three-dimensions.

The dotted line is the contribution of an ideal pion gas in the\nBoltzmann approximation. The dash-dotted (lmax = 1) and dashed (lmax = 2) lines show the\nfirst and the second terms in the series (17), respectively. The temperature axis is normalized\nby Tpc = 180.5 MeV which is the pseudo-critical temperature in the model within the FRG\napproach.\n\nThe isovector fluctuations are regular at the chiral phase transition in an isospin\nsymmetric system. Thus, the \u03c7In remain finite at the phase transition. The last\nterm, which correlates isospin with baryon number, can diverge for sufficiently\nlarge n. However, these terms give subleading contributions to criticality of \u03c7Q\nn.\nThus, the leading singular part of the electric-charge cumulants \u03c7Q\nis\nsolely\nn\ndetermined by \u03c7B\nn . Consequently, at small quark masses, the contributions\nfrom the singular part of the thermodynamic pressure to the net electric charge\nfluctuations should be similar to that found for the net baryon fluctuations.\nThe expected residual O(4) scaling in \u03c7B\nn at finite quark masses is indeed\nobserved in the PQM model in the FRG approach. However, since the regular\ncontributions to the electric charge and to the baryon number fluctuations are\ndifferent, it is not a priori clear that this will be the case also for cumulants \u03c7Q\nn\nof the electric charge.\nIn the following, we compute the temperature dependence of \u03c7Q\nn in the PQM\nmodel with the thermodynamic potential obtained from Eq. (7). We also discuss\nthe contributions of individual modes to the properties of \u03c7Q\nn near the chiral\ntransition.\n3.1. Fluctuations in an interacting pion gas\nWe first consider the contribution of mesonic degrees of freedom to the fluctuations of the net electric charge. Clearly, in such studies pionic interactions\nshould be included. A suitable model for exploring the meson contribution is\nthe mesonic linear sigma model.

The results are also shown for only charged quarks e\u03c0 = 0 and only charged\npions ef = 0 (see text). The hadron resonance gas contribution is shown as dotted lines.\n\nis obtained directly from the flow equation (7) in the limit of Nc \u2192 0. The\nfluctuations of the electric charge are then due only to the charged pion degrees\nof freedom.\nIn the mean-field approximation to the linear sigma model, fluctuations of\nthe electric charge are absent. They can be included perturbatively [34, 35,\n36] or non-perturbatively within the FRG approach, where fluctuations due\nto interacting pions are included [11, 12, 29, 37]. Here we employ the FRG\napproach to account for meson fluctuations.\nThe second and the fourth order cumulants obtained in the FRG approach\nare shown in Fig. 1. Although the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the\nvacuum pion mass, a clear signature of the chiral crossover transition is seen\nin the susceptibilities. In particular, we note the non-monotonic temperature\ndependence of the fourth order cumulant, resulting in a peaked structure near\nthe chiral transition. This behavior is due mostly to the temperature dependence of the pion mass, which up to the chiral transition remains close to its\nvacuum value, while above the transition m\u03c0 grows strongly with temperature.\nConsequently, above the pseudo-critical temperature (Tpc ), all cumulants of the\nnet-charge fluctuations decrease with temperature. Note that this effect is not\na consequence of the cut off, which suppresses high momentum modes in the\nmodel. Due to the large value of \u039b = 1.2 GeV, this suppression sets in only at\nmuch higher temperatures.\nIt is interesting to asses at which temperature pionic interactions start influencing the charge fluctuations. This can be estimated by comparing the FRG\nQ\nresults for the \u03c7Q\n2 and \u03c74 with those obtained for an ideal gas of charged pions.\nThe pressure of the latter is given by\n\u221e\n\u0001\np\u03c0 + + p\u03c0 \u2212\nm2 X 1\n=\nK2 (l\u03b2m) el\u03b2\u03bcq + e\u2212l\u03b2\u03bcq ,\n4\n2\n2\n2\nT\n2\u03c0 T\nl\n\n(16)\n\nl=1\n\nwhere K2 (x) is a modified Bessel function and \u03bcq is the electric chemical potential. In an ideal pion gas, the odd-order cumulants of the electric charge vanish\n7\n\n\fat \u03bcq = 0, while even cumulants are given by\n\u03c7Q\nn =\n\n\u221e\nm2 X n\u22122\nl\nK2 (l\u03b2m).\n\u03c02 T 2\n\n(17)\n\nl=1\n\nThis can be considered as an approximation to the regular part of the fluctuations of the electric charge.\nIn Fig. 1 the contributions of the regular part to the second and fourth\ncumulants are shown. At low temperatures the FRG and ideal pion gas results\nagree. This indicates that the FRG method correctly accounts for the pionic\ncontribution to the thermodynamics.\nThe effect of quantum statistics can be studied by truncating the series in\nEq. (17) at a given order l = lmax . This is illustrated in Fig. 1, where we\nconfront the lmax = 1 and 2 truncations for the second and the fourth order cumulants of the free pion gas with the full (lmax = \u221e) result. Clearly, the leading\ncontribution, which corresponds to Boltzmann statistics, deviates considerably\nfrom the full quantum statistics results, except at very low temperatures. The\nhigher-order terms in the series contribute effectively as multiply charged particles. Hence, their contribution increases with the order of the cumulant. This\nexpectation is confirmed by Fig. 1, which shows that the deviation is stronger\nQ\nfor \u03c7Q\n4 than for \u03c72 . Thus, the effect of quantum statistics cannot be neglected\nin the calculation of fluctuations of the electric charge. This is a reflection of\nthe fact that multi-charged particles can yield a dominant contribution to the\nfluctuations of conserved charges [6]. In QCD this is the case for fluctuations of\nthe electric charge and strangeness, where double- and triple-charged baryons\nplay an important role.\n3.2. Electric charge cumulants in the PQM model\nThe dynamics of the PQM model and its particle content is more relevant for\nQCD than the mesonic linear sigma model described above. The PQM model\ncontains charged-quarks as dynamical degrees of freedom and exhibits statistical\nconfinement through the coupling of the quarks to the effective gluon field.\nQ\nQ\nIn Fig. 2 we show the first three non-trivial cumulants \u03c7Q\n2 , \u03c74 and \u03c76 of\nthe electric charge for vanishing baryon- and electric charge chemical potential\nobtained from Eq. (7). We also show separately the contributions of quarks or\npions. This separation is made by setting the electric charge of pions e\u03c0 and\nthen that of quarks ef to zero, respectively.\nThe second-order cumulant \u03c7Q\n2 shows a rapid increase near the pseudocritical temperature, interpolating between the pion and quark contributions.\nSince \u03c7Q\n2 is not influenced by the singular part of the thermodynamic pressure\n(13), the behavior seen in Fig. 2 is due to the \"statistical confinement\" of the\nPQM model. The rapid increase with temperature is a consequence of the rapid\nunleashing of single- and double-quarks states at the crossover temperature.\nThe pion contribution, on the other hand, is suppressed above Tpc , owing to the\nincreasing thermal mass.\n\n8\n\n\f3.0\n\n25\nFRG\n\nFRG\n\nHRG\n\nHRG\n\n2.5\n\n20\n\n2.0\n\n15\n\nQ\n2\n\n/\n\n10\n\nQ\n6\n\n\u000e\n\nQ\n4\n\n/\n\nQ\n2\n\n\u000f\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n5\n0.0\n\n1.4\n\nT/Tpc\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nT/Tpc\n\nQ\nQ\nQ\nFigure 3: (Color online) The kurtosis (\u03c7Q\n4 /\u03c72 ) and the (\u03c74 /\u03c72 ) ratio calculated in the\nPolyakov loop extended quark-meson model. The arrow shows the corresponding StefanBoltzmann limits. The hadron resonance gas model results are indicated as dotted-lines.\n\nThe fourth- and sixth-order cumulants exhibit a peak, which increases in\nstrength with the order of the cumulant. This can be understood in terms\nof the critical dynamics of the chiral transition; with increasing order of the\ncumulant, the contribution of the singular part of the pressure (13) becomes\nmore and more dominant. The negative structure of the \u03c7Q\n6 near Tpc is similar\nto that observed for the sixth order cumulant of net baryon number fluctuations\nand is due to the particular form of the O(4) scaling function [14]. The peak\nQ\nin \u03c7Q\n4 appears as a sum of quark and pion contributions, while the peak in \u03c76\nQ\nis dominantly due to pions. The negative region of \u03c76 near Tpc is due to the\nquark contribution.\nIn Fig. 2 we also compare the PQM results with that of the hadron resonance\ngas (HRG) model, which includes the contributions of all charged hadrons and\nresonances. The HRG model reproduces the thermodynamics of LQCD in the\nhadronic phase up to T \u2243 0.9Tpc .\nThere is good agreement between the PQM and HRG model results at low\ntemperatures, where in both cases pions are the dominant degrees of freedom.\nFor higher temperatures the HRG overshoots the PQM model results. Thus,\nthe PQM model does not yield a quantitative description of the LQCD results\non thermodynamics. Nevertheless, this model can provide useful insights into\nthe critical dynamics of universal quantities near the chiral phase transition.\nIn order to reduce the contribution of the non-singular part to the fluctuations and to focus on the critical behavior, ratios of \u03c7Q\nn to the second-order\nQ\ncumulant \u03c72 , which is not influenced by the critical chiral dynamics at \u03bc = 0\n[6], have been studied. In Fig. 3 we show the temperature dependence of the\nQ\nQ\nQ\nkurtosis \u03ba = \u03c7Q\n4 /\u03c72 and of the ratio \u03c76 /\u03c72 near the chiral crossover transition. At low temperatures, \u03ba \u2192 1, as expected for a non-interacting Boltzmann\ngas. For higher temperatures, the kurtosis increases owing to the contribution\n\n9\n\n\fof double-charged baryons and to higher order quantum corrections to the pion\ndistribution. Near Tpc and above the quarks dominate, because of the increasing pion mass, resulting in \u03ba decreasing towards the Stefan-Boltzmann limit of\nQ\nfree quark gas. The ratio \u03c7Q\n6 /\u03c72 exhibits a much stronger peak, which diverges\nat the critical temperature in the chiral limit. In analogy with the net baryon\nfluctuations [14, 15], this ratio also develops a negative region near Tpc , owing\nto the chiral critical dynamics encoded in the O(4) scaling function.\nQ\nQ\nQ\nAs shown in Fig. 2, in the PQM model both ratios \u03c7Q\n4 /\u03c72 and \u03c76 /\u03c72\novershoot the HRG model predictions. This indicates that in the HRG model,\nthe contribution of multi-charged states to fluctuations is reduced relative to\nthat of singly-charged particles more than in the PQM model.\n4. Summary and conclusions\nWe have computed the electric charge fluctuations in the vicinity of the chiral\ncrossover transition within effective chiral models. Our calculations include\nnon-perturbative dynamics implemented within the functional renormalization\ngroup approach at finite temperature and at vanishing baryon density. We\nhave performed our studies in the linear sigma model and in the Polyakov\u2013loop\nextended quark-meson model.\nWe find a strong sensitivity of the fluctuations of the electric charge to the\nchiral transition. We have also explored the influence of multi-charged states\nand quantum statistics on the temperature dependence of cumulants of the\nelectric charge.\nOur results show that at physical pion and quark masses, the higher order\ncumulants of the electric charge fluctuations exhibit properties which can be\nlinked to the chiral critical dynamics expected in the O(4) universality class.\nThe qualitative structure of fluctuations in the PQM model is similar to that\nobtained in lattice QCD. This confirms the phenomenological importance of\nelectric charge fluctuations, in particular the sixth- and higher-order cumulants,\nas signatures for the chiral crossover transition in heavy-ion collisions.\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge stimulating discussions with Frithjof Karsch, Kenji Morita\nand Christian Schmidt.
