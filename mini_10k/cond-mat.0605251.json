At high densities, it is known to be profoundly\ninfluenced also by the size ratio \u03c31 /\u03c32 between the diameters of the two components, \u03c31 and \u03c32 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If\n\u03c31 /\u03c32 is close to unity at large n, the system becomes a\ncrystal at low T or a liquid at high T . If \u03c31 /\u03c32 considerably deviates from unity, glass states are realized at large\nn and at low T . In glass states, the particle motions are\nnearly frozen and the structural relaxation time grows,\nbut the particle configurations are random yielding the\nstructure factors similar to those in liquid.\nRecently, the liquid-glass transition has been studied\nin a large number of molecular dynamics simulations on\nmodel binary mixtures both in two and three dimensions\n[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In these simulations, the temperature T\nhas mostly been the control parameter at fixed average\ndensity and composition. Some authors have applied a\nshear rate or a stress to glassy systems as a new control\nparameter [8, 10]. The size ratio \u03c31 /\u03c32 has been chosen at particular values to realize fully frustrated particle configurations and to avoid crystallization and phase\nseparation. However, for weaker size dispersity, the degree of disorder should become smaller. Polycrystals will\nbe realized at some stage and a crystal with a small number of point defects will be reached eventually. On this\ncrossover we are not aware of any systematic study and\nhave no clear picture.\nIn this paper, we first aim to visualize the disorder\nbrought about by the size dispersity in two dimensions\n(2D). To this end we will introduce a disorder variable\nDj (t) \u2265 0 representing a deviation of the hexagonal crystal order around each particle j. Snapshots of Dj (t) realized by each simulation run will exhibit patterns indicating the nature of the defect structure. We shall ob-\n\nserve point defects in crystal, grain boundaries in polycrystal, and amorphous disorder in glass. The average\nPN\nD(t) = j=1 Dj (t)/N over the particles is a single \"disorder parameter\" characterizing the degree of overall disorder.\nHalperin and Nelson [11] found that defects play a key\nrole in 2D melting in one component systems, predicting continuous transitions with an intermediate \"hexatic\"\nphase between crystal and liquid. They introduced a\nsixfold orientation order variable, written as \u03c7j in this\npaper. The correlation function g6 (r) of the thermal\nfluctuations of \u03c7j has been used to characterize the 2D\ndefect-mediated melting theoretically [4, 5, 12] and experimentally [13, 14, 15, 16]. Our disorder variable Dj (t)\nwill be constructed from their \u03c7j , so we will visualize\nthe defect patterns exhibited by Dj (t) also at the melting. The problem becomes much more complex for binary\nmixtures, where the crystal-liquid transition occurs with\nchanging T or n at weak size dispersity [4, 5] and the\nglass-liquid transition occurs at stronger size dispersity\n[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. We should understand the defect structure by changing \u03c31 /\u03c32 and T (and/or n) both at the\ncrystal-glass and crystal-liquid transitions [17].\nIn Sec II, we will introduce the quantities mentioned\nabove and present our numerical results at fixed density and composition, where the defects involved in the\ncrystal-glass and crystal-liquid transitions will be visualized. We will also calculate the overall disorder parameter D(t) in transient states and in steady states as a\nfunction of \u03c31 /\u03c32 and T . In Sec III, we will summarize\nour results and give some remarks.\nII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\nA.\n\nMethod\n\nWe used a 2D model binary mixture interacting via\na truncated Lenard-Jones (LJ) potential v\u03b1\u03b2 (r), where\n\n\f2\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2 represent the particle species. If the distance\nr between two particles is larger than a cut-off rcut , we set\nv\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = 0. If r < rcut , it is given by the Lennard-Jones\npotential,\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0010\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u001112 \u0010 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u00116\n\u2212 C\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(1)\n\u2212\nv\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = 4\u01eb\nr\nr\nwhich is characterized by the energy \u01eb and the soft-core\ndiameter \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03c3\u03b1 + \u03c3\u03b2 )/2 with \u03c31 and \u03c32 representing\nthe (soft-core) diameters of the two components. The\nconstant C\u03b1\u03b2 ensures v\u03b1\u03b2 (r) \u2192 0 as r \u2192 rcut , so the\npotential is continuous at the cut-off distance. We set\nrcut = 3.2\u03c31 for any \u03b1 and \u03b2 [18]. The particle numbers\nof the two species are N1 = N2 = 500, so N = N1 +\nN2 = 103 . With varying the size ratio \u03c32 /\u03c31 , the system\nvolume V was changed such that the volume fraction of\nthe soft-core regions defined by\n\u03c6 = (N1 \u03c312 + N2 \u03c322 )/V\n\n(2)\n\nwas fixed at 0.9 mostly. We set \u03c6 = 1 only in one case\n(in the lower panel of Fig.8). With the mass ratio being\nm1 /m2 = (\u03c31 /\u03c32 )2 , we integrated the Newton equations\nusing the leapfrog algorithm under the periodic boundary\ncondition. The system temperature was controlled with\nthe Nose-Hoover thermostat [19, 20, 21]. The time step\nof integration was 0.002\u03c4 , where\np\n\u03c4 = \u03c31 m1 /\u01eb.\n(3)\n\nHereafter the time t and the temperature T will be measured in units of \u03c4 and \u01eb/kB , respectively.\nWe first equilibrated the system in a liquid state at\nT = 2 in a time interval of 103 and then quenched it\nto a lower final temperature with further equilibration\nin a period of teq = 1.1 \u00d7 104 [22, 23]. There was no\nappreciable time evolution in the pressure, the energy, etc\nin the time region t & 4 \u00d7 103 (see Fig.8 as an example)\n[24]. The particles were well mixed and no indication of\nphase separation was observed in the final time region.\nIn our study, the size ratio was in the range 1 \u2264\n\u03c31 /\u03c32 \u2264 1.4. We saw no tendency of phase separation. If \u03c31 /\u03c32 is too large, phase separation will be detected [25, 26]. We show typical particle configurations\nin Fig.1 at the final simulation time t = 1.2 \u00d7 104 for (a)\n\u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.1, (b) 1.2, (c) 1.225, and (d) 1.4 at \u03c6 = 0.9.\nThe system length V 1/2 is (a) 35.03, (b) 36.81, (c) 37.27,\nand (d) 40.55 in units of \u03c31 . They represent (a) a crystal\nstate with point defects, (b) and (c) polycrystal states,\nand (d) a glass state.\nB.\n\nSixfold orientation order\n\nIn Fig.1, a large fraction of the particles are enclosed\nby six particles even at \u03c31 /\u03c32 = 1.4. The particle configurations are remote from other ordered structures such\nas the square structure [3]. Therefore, we consider deviations from the hexagonal order. The local crystalline\n\nFIG. 1: Particle configurations for (a) \u03c31 /\u03c32 = 1.1, (b) 1.2,\n(c) 1.225, and (d) 1.4 at \u03c6 = 0.9 and T = 0.2 taken at the\nfinal simulation time t = 1.2 \u00d7 104 . Smaller (larger) circles\nrepresent the smaller (larger) particles. For the visualization\npurpose the diameters of the circles in the snapshots are taken\nas A\u03c31 and A\u03c32 with A < 1 for the two species.\n\norder is represented by a sixfold orientation order variable [11]. For each particle j we define\nX\n\u03c7j =\nexp[6i\u03b8jk ],\n(4)\nk\u2208bonded\n\nwhere the summation is over the particles \"bonded\" to\nthe particle j. In our case, the two particles j \u2208 \u03b1 and\nk \u2208 \u03b2 are bonded, if their distance rjk = |r j \u2212 rk | is\nshorter than R\u03b1\u03b2 = 1.25\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 [8]. The upper cut-off R\u03b1\u03b2\nis slightly longer than the first peak position of the paircorrelation function g\u03b1\u03b2 (r). The \u03b8jk is the angle of the\nrelative vector rj \u2212 r k with respect to the x axis. For a\nperfect triangular crystal of a one component system, the\ncomplex numbers \u03c7j are all equal to 6 exp(6i\u03b1) with \u03b1\nbeing the common angle of one of the crystal axes with\nrespect to the x axis. In the presence of disorder, the\nabsolute values |\u03c7j | are significantly different from 6 for\nparticles around defects. It is convenient to define a local\ncrystalline angle \u03b1j in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b1j < \u03c0/3 by\n\u03a6j = \u03c7j /|\u03c7j | = e6i\u03b1j .\n\n(5)\n\nIn Fig.2, we show the snapshots of the angles \u03b1j (j =\n1, * * * , 103 ) for the same particle configurations in Fig.1.\nThe color map is illustrated in Fig.3. We can clearly\nsee point defects, grain boundaries, and glassy particle\nconfigurations. In (b) the grain boundaries are localized,\nwhile in (c) they are percolated.

The color of particle j is then blue.\n\nC.\n\nDisorder variable\n\nWe next introduce a new variable representing the degree of disorder. In terms of the difference \u03a6k \u2212 \u03a6j be-\n\ntween the bonded particle pairs, we define\nX\nDj =\n|\u03a6j \u2212 \u03a6k |2\nk\u2208bonded\n\n= 2\n\nX\n\n[1 \u2212 cos 6(\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1k )],\n\n(6)\n\nk\u2208bonded\n\nfor each particle j. This quantity is called the disorder\nvariable. If the thermal vibrations are neglected, Dj vanishes in single-component perfect crystals and is nonvanishing around defects. It takes large values of order unity\nalmost everywhere in highly frustrated glass states. See\nthe comment (iv) in the last section for appropriateness\nof this variable in glass and liquid.\nIn Fig.4, snapshots of Dj are shown for (a) \u03c32 /\u03c31 =\n1.1, (a') 1.15, (b) 1.2, (c) 1.225, (c') 1.25, and (d) 1.4 at\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: Structure factor for (a') \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.15, (b) 1.2, and\n(b') 1.225 in Fig.4. Bragg peaks can be seen in (a) and (b),\nwhile it resembles to that in liquid for (c) (see (c) in Fig.7).\n\nlational order is being lost. (See Fig.9 below for structure\nfactors in typical cases far from the transitions.) We note\nthat similar structure factors were taken from a quasi 2D\ncolloid suspension around the melting [13].\nThe timescale of the particle configurations becomes\nexceedingly slow in glass states [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Also\nin polycrystal states, the motions of the grain boundaries become slow with increasing \u03c32 /\u03c31 , while the grain\nboundaries coarsen to disappear in one component systems on a rapid timescale (see the corresponding curve\nin Fig.7) [27]. In Fig.6, we present two additional snapshots of Dj (t) at \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.225 for t = 6 \u00d7 103 and\nt = 8 \u00d7 103 , while the panel (b) in Fig.4 is the snapshot\nat t = 12 \u00d7 103 in the same run. These three snapshots\nexhibit percolated grain boundaries with only small differences on large scales, indicating pinning of the grain\nboundaries. The panel (b) in Fig.2 demonstrates that the\nsystem is a polycrystal. As a result, we cannot deduce\nthe life time of the gran boundaries from our simulation\nin this case.\n\nFIG. 6: Disorder variable Dj in Eq.(6) in a polycrystal state\nat \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.225 for (b1) t = 6 \u00d7 103 and (b2) t = 8 \u00d7 103 ,\nin the same run giving the panel (b) in Fig.4 at t = 12 \u00d7 103 .\nComparison of these three snapshots indicates very slow time\nevolution of the grain boundaries. See points (b1), (b2), and\n(b) in Fig.7 also.\n\nthe final states of the simulation runs at t = 1.2 \u00d7 104 .\nThose of (a), (b), (c), and (d) are taken from the same\nparticle configurations as in the corresponding panels of\nFigs.1 and 2. The color of the particles varies in the order of rainbow, being violet for Dj = 0 and red for the\nmaximum of Dj . In Fig.4, the maximum of Dj is 1.71,\n2.64, 3.59, 4.36, 4.34, and 4.58 in (a)-(d) in this order. In\ncrystals with \u03c32 /\u03c31 close to unity, a small number of defects can be detected as bright points as in (a) and (a').\nIn polycrystals, defects are accumulated to form grain\nboundaries detectable as bright closed curves enclosing\nsmall crystalline regions, as in (b) and (c). With further\nincreasing \u03c32 /\u03c31 , defects are proliferated and a large fraction of the particles are depicted as bright points. In the\nlargest size ratio in (d), most of the particles are in disordered configurations. With varying \u03c32 /\u03c31 , this crossover\noccurs in a narrow range around 1.2.\nIn Fig.5, the structure factor of the number density\nn(r) = n1 (r) + n2 (r) is written for (a) \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.15,\n(b) 1.2, and (c) 1.225 to confirm the abruptness of this\ncrystal-glass crossover. The structure factor in (a) exhibits Bragg peaks showing translational order, while\nthat in (c) is similar to that in liquid but still retains the\nsixfold angular symmetry. For the intermediate case (b),\nthe sixfold symmetry is evidently present and the trans-\n\nFIG. 7: Relaxation of the disorder parameter D(t) in Eq.(7)\nat \u03c6 = 0.9 for \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.0, 1.175, 1.2, 1.225, and 1.4 from\nbelow. The temperature T is lowered from 2 to 0.2 at t = 103 .\nFor the one component case \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.0, it takes place on a\ntimescale of 50, as shown in the expanded inset. With size\ndispersity, D(t) relaxes slowly on timescales of order 4 \u00d7 103 .\nSnapshots of Dj (t) at two points (b1) and (b2) on the curve\nof \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.2 are given in Fig.6.\n\nD.\n\nDegree of overall disorder\n\nWe now introduce a single \"disorder parameter\" representing the degree of overall disorder by taking the average over all the particles,\nD(t) =\n\n1 X\nDj (t),\nN j\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the time-dependence of Dj (t) and D(t) is explicitly\nwritten. In Fig.7, we show time evolution of D(t), where\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 9: Disorder parameter D\u0304 in Eq.(8) as a function of \u03c32 /\u03c31\nand T for \u03c6 = 0.9. Typical structure factors for (A) crystal,\n(B) glass, and (C) liquid in the upper panel, where the corresponding points are indicated in the lower panel.\n\nFIG. 8: Disorder parameter D\u0304 in Eq.(8) for T = 0.2 and 2,\nwith \u03c6 = 0.9 in the upper panel and 1 in the lower panel.\nLiquid states are realized on the curve of T = 2 in the upper\npanel. The other curves show the crystal-glass crossover.\n\nquenching is from liquid at t = 103 . It undergoes very\nslow time evolution with finite size dispersity in polycrystal and glass, in accord with Fig.6. For \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1.4, D(t)\nincreases upon quenching (see Fig.9 below for its reason).\nIn the time region t & 4 \u00d7 103 , we can see no appreciable\nrelaxation in these curves. For the one component case,\nthe relaxation from liquid to crystal terminates rapidly\non a timescale of 50.\nHowever, the curves in Fig.7 with size dispersity\nweakly depend on time around the average even in apparent steady states. For example, D(t) is 1.10 in (b1) of\nFig.6, 1.17 in (b2) of Fig.6, and 1.11 in (b) of Fig.4. This\ntemporal fluctuations should diminish for larger system\nsize. Its deviation from the time average became largest\nwhen the grain boundaries appreciably moved in polycrystal states. For each simulation run, we defined the\ntime average of D(t) as\nD\u0304 =\n\n1\ntd\n\nZ\n\ntf\n\ndtD(t),\n\n(8)\n\ntf \u2212td\n\nwhere tf (= 1.2 \u00d7 104 ) is the terminal time of the simulation run and td (= 2 \u00d7 103 ) is the width of the time\ninterval of taking data. We regard D\u0304 as a steady state\n\naverage though glass states may further relax on longer\ntimescales.\nIn Fig.8, we plot D\u0304 as a function of the size ratio. In\nthe upper panel, where \u03c6 = 0.9, liquid states are realized\nfor any \u03c32 /\u03c31 at T = 2, while the system is crystalline\nfor \u03c32 /\u03c31 . 1.2 and glassy for larger \u03c32 /\u03c31 at T = 0.2.\nIn the range \u03c32 /\u03c31 & 1.3, D\u0304 in the liquid state at T = 2\nbecomes smaller than D\u0304 in the glass state at T = 0.2.\nThis is because D\u0304 increases weakly with increasing \u03c32 /\u03c31\nin liquid and increases more strongly in glass. In the\nlower panel, where \u03c6 = 1, the system crosses over from\ncrystal to glass both for T = 0.2 and 2, and D\u0304 increases\nrather abruptly around \u03c32 /\u03c31 \u223c 1.2. For \u03c32 /\u03c31 . 1.1, D\u0304\ntakes a small positive number due to the thermal motions\nof the particles. In Fig.9, D\u0304 is plotted as a function of\n\u03c32 /\u03c31 and T . It shows the overall behavior of D\u0304. That\nis, D\u0304 is small in crystal and increases abruptly in glass\nand liquid. Interestingly, for \u03c32 /\u03c31 > 1.25, D\u0304 decreases\nwith increasing T from glass to liquid (see Fig.7). For\nsuch size ratios, highly disordered particle configurations\ncan be pinned at low T and the thermal motions at high\nT can relax them.\nE.\n\nDefect-mediated melting\n\nIn our simulations at fixed density, we observed defect\nproliferation at the melting (as well as at the crystal-glass\ncrossover) and no coexistence of crystal and liquid regions\nseparated by sharp interfaces. The system became highly\n\n\f6\nhexatic-to- liquid transition. Among many experiments,\ngrain boundaries were evidently shown in Ref.[15].\nWe notice close similarity between the snapshots of the\npolycrystal states in Figs.6 and 10. However, very different are the timescales of the dynamics of Dj (t) without\nand with size dispersity. Indeed, the patterns in Fig.10\nchanged appreciably on a rapid timescale of 50, while\nthe large scale patterns in Fig.6 were nearly frozen in our\nsimulation time.\n\nIII.\n\nFIG. 10: Polycrystal configurations of \u03b1j in Eq.(5) (top) and\nDj in Eq.(6) (bottom) at t = 6\u00d7103 (left) and 6.2\u00d7103 (right)\nin the one component case \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1 at T = 1.3 and \u03c6 = 0.9.\nThe system is intermediate between crystal and liquid. The\ndefect structure is evolving rapidly on a timescale of 50.\n\nheterogeneous (as in Fig.10 below), but no nucleation\nprocess could be detected. Figure 9 shows that D\u0304 changes\ncontinuously along the T axis at each \u03c32 /\u03c31 including\nthe one component limit \u03c32 /\u03c31 = 1. Similarly, in a 2D\nLenard-Jones system with N = 256 at \u03c6 = 0.8, Frenkel\nand Mctague detected no discontinuity in the average\npressure and energy [12]. Theoretically, the 2D melting\ncan be either continuous or first ordrer depending the\nspecific details of the system [28, 29]. It is a delicate\nproblem to determine its precise nature in the presence\nof the heterogeneity developing at the transition [13, 14,\n15, 16].\nTo visualize the physical process involved at the melting, we display snapshots of \u03b1j (t) and Dj (t) at t = 6000\nand 6200 in Fig.10 in the one component case at T = 1.3,\nwhere the change of D\u0304 is abrupt in Fig.9. The D(t) in\nEq.(7) is 1.80 at t = 6000 and 1.60 at t = 6200. We\ncan see percolated grain-boundary patterns and chains of\npoint defects. The area fraction of the crystalline regions\nwith small Dj continuously decreases (increases) with\nfurther raising (lowering) the temperature. We mention a\nsimulation by McTague et al. in a one component system\nwith soft-disk r\u22126 potentials [30], reporting the presence\nof both free dislocations and many grain boundaries at\nthe melting. Some authors already pointed out relevance\nof grain boundaries in the 2D melting [29, 31]. Using\ninherent-structures theory, Somer et al. [32] found percolated grain boundaries in \"inherent structures\" after a\n\nSUMMARY AND REMARKS\n\nIn summary, using MD simulation on a 2D LJ binary\nmixture, we have investigated the effects of the size dispersity in the range 1 \u2264 \u03c31 /\u03c32 \u2264 1.4 and the temperature\nin the particle configurations at fixed average density and\ncomposition. Our main objective has been to visualize\ndefects, so the system size (N = 103 ) has been chosen\nto be rather small. Larger system sizes are needed to\nget reliable correlation functions of the density and the\nsixfold orientation variable.\nWe summarize our main results and give remarks.\n(i) We have displayed the angle variable \u03b1j defined by\nEq.(5) in Fig.2 and the disorder variable Dj (t) defined\nby Eq.(6) in Fig.4 at low T = 0.2. The snapshots of\nthese variables evidently show how the particle configurations become disordered with increasing the size ratio. Those of Dj (t) provide the real space pictures of\nthe defect structures on various spatial scales. We find\npolycrystal states with grain boundaries between crystal\nand glass. The motions of the grain boundaries are much\nslowed down with size dispersity, as in Figs.6 and 7.\n(ii) The disorder parameter D(t) in Eq.(7) or its time average D\u0304 in Eq.(8) is a measure of overall disorder. As in\nFig.7, the relaxation of D(t) after quenching from a high\nto a low temperature occurs on a very long timescale with\nsize dispersity, while it relaxes much faster in one component systems. The steady state average D\u0304 is small in\ncrystal and increases abruptly in glass and liquid, with\nincreasing \u03c31 /\u03c32 or T , as in Figs.8 and 9.\n(iii) In our system, the crystal-glass and crystal-liquid\ncrossovers proceeded with increasing the defect density\nwithout nucleation. Remarkable resemblance is noteworthy between the polycrystal patterns of Dj (t) at the\ncrystal-glass transition in Figs.4 and 6 and those in the\none component case at the crystal-liquid transition in\nFig.10. However, the timescale of the defect structure is\ndrastically enlarged with increasing \u03c31 /\u03c32 . In these two\ntransitions, the disorder parameter D\u0304 increases abruptly\nbut continuously from small (crystal) values to large\n(glass or liquid) values. In these cases, polycrystal states\nappear with large scale heterogeneities in Dj (t), as can\nbe seen in Figs.4, 6, and 10.\n(iv) The particle configurations will increasingly deviate\nfrom the hexagonal order in the crossover from crystal\nto glass or liquid. They might become rather closer to\nother ordered structures for some fraction of the particles\n\n\f7\n[3, 4]. In such cases, large values of Dj (t) and D\u0304 will have\nonly qualitative meaning, since they represent deviations\nfrom the hexagonal order.\n(v) We should study the pinning mechanism of grain\nboundaries in polycrystal in the presence of size dispersity. We should also examine the dynamical properties\nsuch as the diffusion constant, the shear viscosity, and\nthe time-correlation functions for various degrees of disorder. They have been calculated around the liquid-glass\ntransition [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\n(vi) For the pair potentials in Eq.(1) and for our limited\nsimulation time, we have detected no tendency of phase\nseparation. By increasing the repulsion among the different components, we could study nucleation of crystalline\ndomains in a glass matrix, for example.\n(vii) We will report shortly on the shear flow effect at the\n\ncrystal-glass and crystal-liquid transitions in 2D. It has\nalready been studied at the liquid-glass transition [8, 10].\nIt is of interest how an applied shear affects the defect\nstructure and induces plastic deformations [33].\n\n[1] E.
