In the\nintrinsic quantization approach, the motion is constrained to the manifold a priori. A classical Hamiltonian is constructed from coordinates and momentum intrinsic to the surface\nand the system is quantized canonically. In this case, the embedding space Rn is irrelevant\nand the quantum system depends only on the geometry intrinsic to the manifold. In the\nconfining potential approach, the particle is confined by a strong force that acts normal to\nthe manifold. An effective Hamiltonian for propagation on the hypersurface is obtained\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nEmail: schuster@mit.edu\nEmail: jaffe@lns.mit.edu\n\nHomepage: http://web.mit.edu/schuster/Public/homepage.html\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nP.C. Schuster and R.L. Jaffe\n\nby freezing the motion normal to the surface in a low state of excitation of the confining\npotential. This effective Hamiltonian depends on the intrinsic geometry and on the way\nthat the hypersurface is embedded in Rn . The intrinsic quantization scheme suffers from\nordering ambiguities that allow for multiple consistent quantization procedures that differ\nby a term proportional to the scalar curvature of the hypersurface [1]. On the other hand,\nthe confining potential approach yields a unique effective Hamiltonian that depends on the\nphysical mechanism of the constraint. In any real physical system we know of, constrained\nmotion is the result of a strong confining force, and so one can argue that the confining\npotential formalism offers a physically more realistic model of constraints. Although intrinsic quantization has been studied since the earliest days of quantum theory, the confining\npotential approach has only received serious attention in the last decade or two [2, 3, 4].\nThe confining potential approach has now been studied for a variety of systems using a\nvariety of different confining forces. It has been applied to the study of both spinless and\nspin- 21 particles confined to thin tubes and especially under the assumption that the curvature of the tube is small and slowly varying [4, 5]. Spinless particles confined to surfaces\nin three dimensional space have also been studied by da Costa [3], and the generalization\nto an arbitrary m-dimensional manifold M m embedded in a n-dimensional Euclidean space\nhas been carried out by subsequent authors [6, 7, 8, 9]. Extensions of the confining potential approach have been applied to solitons with confined collective degrees of freedom [9]\nand to systems for which the effective Hamiltonian on the hypersurface admits supersymmetric states [10]. Notable applications of the confining potential formalism include the\nstudy of rotational spectra of molecules [7] and the study of electrons in Quantum Hall\ndevices [11]. In this paper, we review and develop the confining potential formalism in the\nspirit of Refs. [9] and [6]. We devote special attention to the group-theoretic structure of\nthe torsion-dependent terms that appear in the effective Hamiltonian, as well as the role\nplayed by symmetries of the confining potential. We also recast the mathematical form of\nthe curvature-dependent potentials found by previous authors in terms of \"principal curvatures\" so that the effects of the embedding structure on the effective dynamics can be more\neasily understood.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the physical motivation\nbehind the confining potential approach. In Section 3, we introduce an adapted coordinate\nsystem that allows one to separate normal from tangential degrees of freedom on M m . In\nSection 4, we derive the effective Hamiltonian governing motion on M m by rescaling the\ncollective normal coordinates and developing a perturbative expansion in small parameters\nof the complete Hamiltonian as found in [7]. In Section 5, we discuss in detail the gauge\nstructure of the effective theory with special attention devoted to the representation content of the gauge fields. In Section 6, we discuss the intrinsic versus extrinsic geometrical\ncontributions to the effective theory on M m and give examples that illustrate the possible\nphysics for M 3 embedded in Rn\u22654 . Section 7 concludes with final thoughts and discussion.\n\n\fQuantum Mechanics on Manifolds Embedded in Euclidean Space\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThe Confining Potential Approach\n\nWe limit ourselves to the case of a scalar confining potential, although magnetic-like vector\npotentials and gravitational-like tensor potentials are physically relevant in some instances\nand have received attention in the literature [12]. A strong confining potential is introduced\nin all directions normal to the hypersurface. The effect of this potential is to constrain the\nparticle to the manifold by raising the energy of normal excitations far beyond the energy\nscale associated with motion tangent to the hypersurface. The Hamiltonian then separates\ninto a term governing high energy confined motion in the directions normal to M m , a term\ngoverning low energy motion tangent to M m , and interaction terms that couple the normal\nand the tangential degrees of freedom. To obtain an effective Hamiltonian on M m , the\ntotal Hamiltonian is projected onto a low-lying multiplet of normal states, typically the\nground state. The effective Hamiltonian governing dynamics on M m is found to be the\nLaplacian on M m coupled minimally to a background gauge field plus a scalar quantum\neffective potential that depends on the principal curvatures of M m [3]. The gauge group is\nwhatever subgroup of SO(n \u2212 m = p) is preserved by the confining potential. The strength\nand representation content of the gauge terms appearing in the effective theory depend\nnot only on the properties of the embedding of M m , but also crucially on the symmetries\nof the space of normal states. When the normal space is trivial, the gauge interaction in\nthe effective Hamiltonian vanishes identically. Only in cases where the normal space is\nnontrivial (i.e., possesses degeneracies) will the gauge interaction be nonzero. Thus static\nexternal SO(p) gauge fields can be geometrically induced by confining particles to manifolds\nthat are embedded nontrivially in a higher dimensional Euclidean space using confining\npotentials that admit a degenerate space of normal states.\n\n3\n\nGeometry\n\nTo study the quantum mechanics of a spinless particle confined to an m-dimensional manifold M m embedded in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn , we first define a coordinate\nsystem that facilitates the separation of the degrees of freedom normal to M m from those\nthat are tangential. With R : M m \u2212\u2192 Rn denoting an embedding of M m in Rn , and\nx\u03bc , \u03bc = 1, . . . , m a local coordinate system on M m , we introduce an adapted coordinate frame\nF defined by a smooth assignment of m linearly independent tangent vectors t\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc R,\nand n \u2212 m = p orthogonal normal vectors n\u0302i (x), i = m + 1, . . . , n. In a sufficiently small\nneighborhood of M m , the Cartesian coordinates, r, for a point in Rn can be reexpressed as\nr(x, y) = R(x) + y i n\u0302i (x)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x denotes an appropriate set of the x\u03bc and y a set of distances y i from M m in the\ndirections n\u0302i (x). The metric in the frame F is defined by\nGAB \u2261 \u2202A r * \u2202B r\n\n(2)\n\n\f4\n\nP.C. Schuster and R.L. Jaffe\n\nwhere A, B = 1, . . . , n, and derivatives are taken with respect to adapted frame coordinates,\nx\u03bc and y i . To calculate GAB , we need expressions for \u2202\u03bc n\u0302i and \u2202\u03bc t\u03bd . Applying a generalized\nform of the Frenet-Serret equations [13], we may write\nij j\n\u2202\u03bc n\u0302i = \u2212\u03b1i\u03bd\n\u03bc t\u03bd \u2212 A\u03bc n\u0302\n\n\u2202\u03bc t\u03bd = \u0393\u03c1\u03bc\u03bd t\u03c1 + \u03b1i\u03bc\u03bd n\u0302i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\ng\u03bc\u03bd = t\u03bc * t\u03bd\n\n\u03b1i\u03bc\u03bd = t\u03bc * \u2202\u03bd n\u0302i\n\ni\nj\nAij\n\u03bc = n\u0302 * \u2202\u03bc n\u0302\n\n(4)\n\nand \"*\" is the standard inner product on Rn . In the language of differential geometry, g\u03bc\u03bd ,\nm\n\u03b1i\u03bc\u03bd , and Aij\n\u03bc are the first fundamental form (the metric on M ), the second fundamental\nform, and the normal fundamental form, respectively. The \u0393\u03c1\u03bc\u03bd are the usual Christoffel\nsymbols, but they will play little role in the discussion that follows. We follow conventional\nnotation in that lower indices on tensors are obtained from upper indices by contraction\nwith g\u03bc\u03bd .\nNote that the choice of an adapted coordinate frame is not unique. In particular, one\nadapted coordinate frame is carried into another by a point-dependent rotation of the n\u0302i .\nUnder the action of a rotation, Rij (x), on the normal vectors n\u0302i , \u03b1i\u03bc\u03bd transforms as an\nSO(p) vector, and Aij\n\u03bc as an SO(p) gauge connection\nik kl jl\nik\njk\nAij\n\u03bc \u2212\u2192 R A\u03bc R + R \u2202\u03bc R .\n\nThe metric can be determined from eqs.

The quantum description of dynamics on M m\nis unambiguously defined by the free Hamiltonian HE on Rn together with the potential\nthat confines the particle to M m . To obtain the effective Hamiltonian on M m , we rewrite\nHE in terms of our adapted frame coordinates, and then project it onto the space of states\ndescribing the confined normal degrees of freedom. In Cartesian coordinates rA , and working\nin units where ~ and the mass of our particle is equal to unity, we have\nE E\nHE = \u2212 12 \u2202A\n\u2202A + V\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u2202 E denotes derivatives taken with respect to Euclidean coordinates, and V \u2261 V (y) is\nthe confining potential that depends only on the normal coordinates. Following convention,\nwe normalize the wave function \u03a6 of the system according to the condition\nZ\n|\u03a6|2 dn r = 1.\n(10)\nChanging coordinates to x and y, the Hamiltonian given in eq. (9) becomes\nHE = \u2212\n\n1\n\u2202A GAB |G|1/2 \u2202B + V\n2|G|1/2\n\nand the normalization condition of eq. (10) becomes\nZ\n|\u03a6|2 |G|1/2 dm x dp y = 1.\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nSince we want to obtain a wave function describing a quantum mechanical probability\ndensity for a particle moving on M m , we rescale the wave function \u03a6 by |G|1/4 / |g|1/4 , where\n|g| is the determinant of g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8 \u2261 (|G|1/4 / |g|1/4 )\u03a6. Likewise, we rescale the Hamiltonian\nHE , H \u2261 (|G|1/4 / |g|1/4 )HE (|g|1/4 / |G|1/4 ). \u03a8 is then normalized on M m as\nZ\ndm x |g|1/2 dp y |\u03a8|2 = 1\n(13)\nR\nand so dp y |\u03a8|2 can be interpreted as a probability density for a particle moving on M m\ndefined with respect to the conventional manifold measure dm x| g|1/2 . Returning to H, we\nmay use the explicit form for GAB in eq.

To do this, we\nexploit the fact that V is a function of the normal coordinates y i alone and V has a deep\nminimum at y i = 0. Thus, we may expand V as a power series in the y i about its minimum,\nV (y i ) = 12 \u03c9 2 y i2 + O(y 3 )\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we have assumed that V is symmetric in the y i up to quadratic order.2 Since V has\na deep minimum, we can neglect terms of order y 3 and higher. In neglecting these terms,\nwe are assuming that \u03c9 is much larger than the scale of curvatures on M m , denoted by \u03ba.\nMore specifically, \u03c9 \u226b \u03ba2 . Following the approach of Refs. [7] and [8], we adsorb the scale\nof the frequency \u03c9 in eq. (16) into a small dimensionless parameter \u01eb, \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9/\u01eb, so that the\nrescaled \u03c9 is of order \u03ba2 . We then use \u01eb as a natural perturbative parameter in the theory.\nThus, the dominant pieces of the Hamiltonian in eq. (15) that act on the transverse space\nare\n1\n1\nH0 = \u2212 \u2202i \u2202i + 2 \u03c9 2 y i2 .\n(17)\n2\n2\u01eb\nFormally, we want to consider the limit \u01eb \u2192 0. However, the divergence in the potential\n(1/2\u01eb2 )\u03c9 i2 y i2 in the \u01eb \u2192 0 limit complicates the analysis. To avoid this problem, we rescale\nthe coordinates y i , as y i \u2192 \u01eb1/2 y i , which allows us to rewrite eq. (17) as\nH0 =\n\n1\n1 1\n(\u2212 \u2202i \u2202i + \u03c9 2 y i2 ).\n\u01eb 2\n2\n\n(18)\n\nThus, we can study the \u01eb \u2192 0 limit unambiguously by considering \u01ebH. We apply this\napproach to the complete Hamiltonian to develop an expansion of \u01ebH in powers of \u01eb,\n\u01ebH = \u01240 + \u01eb\u0124 + O(\u01eb3/2 )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere\n\u01240 =\nand3\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212\u2202i \u2202i + \u03c9 i2 y i2\n\n\u0001\n\n(20)\n\n\u0001\ni kl \u0011 1 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\u03c3 i i\n1 \u0010\ni ij \u0011 \u03bc\u03bd 1/2 \u0010\ng\ng\n\u2202\n+\nA\nL\nA\u03bd Lkl + 8 g g\n\u2202\n+\n\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 2\u03b1i\u03bc\u03c1 \u03b1i\u03bd\u03c3 .

Given that we are interested in the \u01eb \u2192 0 limit, the\n2\n\n3\n\nAsymmetric scalar confining potentials are considered in Ref. [6]\n3/2\nTo obtain eq.

(19) is \u0124. From here on\nwe keep only \u0124 which survives as \u01eb \u2192 0.\nTo obtain an effective Hamiltonian on M m , we need to \"freeze\" the normal degrees\nof freedom. We separate the wave function \u03a8 into a function depending on the normal\ncoordinates y i , and a function depending on the manifold coordinates x\u03bc\nX\n\u03a8(x, y) =\n\u03c8\u03b2 (x)\u03c7\u03b2 (y)\n(22)\n\u03b2\n\nwhere the index \u03b2 = 1, . . . , d labels any degeneracy that exists in the spectrum of the O(1/\u01eb)\nHamiltonian \u01240 /\u01eb governing the normal degrees of freedom. \u01240 is degenerate because of the\nSO(p) symmetry of V (y), and so the eigenstates of \u01240 can be decomposed into irreducible\nSO(p) multiplets. For the case of a p-dimensional symmetric harmonic oscillator, the ground\nstate of \u01240 belongs to the trivial representation of SO(p), while the first excited state belongs\nto the p-dimensional \"fundamental\" representation of SO(p). The \u03c7\u03b2 (y) satisfy to O(1/\u01eb)\n1\n\u01240 \u03c7\u03b2 (y) = E0 \u03c7\u03b2 (y)\n\u01eb\n\n(23)\n\nwhere E0 gives the largest O(1/\u01eb) contribution to the total energy E of the system. Upon\nprojection onto the space of states spanned by \u03c71 (y), . . . , \u03c7d (y), \u0124 becomes a d \u00d7 d matrix\n\u0124 with components\nZ\ndp y \u03c7\u2217\u03b1 (y)\u0124\u03c7\u03b2 (y).\n\n\u0124\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n(24)\n\n~\n\u0124 acts on the wave function \u03c8(x)\n(with components \u03c8\u03b2 (x)), and the dynamics on M m is\ndetermined by\n~\n~\n\u0124\u03c8(x)\n= \u00ca \u03c8(x)\n(25)\n\nwhere \u00ca is the O(\u01eb0 ) correction to the total energy E of the system.\n\n5\n\nGauge Structure\n\nTo better understand the structure of the effective Hamiltonian \u0124, we return to expression\n(21).

(24), the effective Hamiltonian on M m can be rewritten as\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc )g\u03bc\u03bd g1/2 (\u2202\u03bd \u2212 iA\u03bd ) + P\n2g1/2\n\n(27)\n\n\f8\n\nP.C.

(27) generates a term W = 18 g\u03bc\u03bd Aij\n\u03bc A\u03bd (Lij,kl \u2212 Lij Lkl ) which\nis kept explicitly by other workers. Since the confining potential V (y) possesses a SO(p)\nsymmetry, all of the Lij 's commute with \u0124 and {\u03c7\u03b2 (y)} forms a complete set of states for\nthe subspace spanned by Lij \u03c71 (y), . . . , Lij \u03c7d (y) for all i, j. Consequently, W is zero.\n\u0124 is the Hamiltonian for a spinless particle in a curved space in the presence of background SO(p) gauge fields and a geometrically induced potential. We emphasize that the\ngauge potentials are only present if the normal wavefunction lies in a degenerate, nontrivial\nrepresentation of SO(p). The effective physics on M m governed by \u0124 remains invariant\nunder local SO(p) gauge transformations of the normal coordinates. Under SO(p) rotations\n~\nof the n\u0302i , A\u03bc transforms as a gauge field in the adjoint representation of SO(p), while \u03c8(x)\ntransforms in some d-dimensional representation Dd of SO(p). In particular, under the\ntransformation\nn\u0302i \u2212\u2192 (R)ij n\u0302j\n(29)\n~\nwhere R = ei\u03b8ij L\u0303ij is an element of the vector representation of SO(p), \u03c8(x),\nA\u03bc , and P\ntransform as\n\n~\n~\n\u03c8(x)\n\u2212\u2192 V \u03c8(x)\n\nA\u03bc \u2212\u2192 VA\u03bc V T + V\u2202\u03bc V T\nP \u2212\u2192 P\n\n(30)\n\nwhere V = ei\u03b8ij Lij is in the Dd matrix representation of SO(p). As promised, the invariance\nof V under SO(p)-rotations is realized as an SO(p) gauge invariance of the effective theory\non M m .\nThe field strength tensor, G\u03bc\u03bd , associated with the gauge potential A\u03bc is given by\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc + [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ].\n\n(31)\n\nAlthough a nonvanishing field strength is a sufficient condition for the gauge potential A\u03bc to\nhave a physical effect, it is not necessary. As Takagi and Tanzawa have noted, even in cases\nwith vanishing field strength, global Aharonov-Bohm effects can exist when the constraint\nhypersurface has nonvanishing torsion [4]. Subsequent authors have further explored the\nconnection between Aharonov-Bohm effects and the geometry of the constraint hypersurface\nfor the case of M 1 embedded in Rn [9].\n\n6\n\nIntrinsic and Extrinsic Geometry Contributions\n\nIn this section, we consider two questions: First, what features of \u0124 cannot be purely\nattributed to the intrinsic geometry of M m ? Second, what type of embedding structure\n\n\fQuantum Mechanics on Manifolds Embedded in Euclidean Space\n\n9\n\nis needed to generate nontrivial geometrically induced physics effects for the case of M 3\nembedded in Rn\u22654 ?\nUpon examining eqs. (27) and (28), we see that the intrinsic contributions to \u0124 are\nfrom the Laplacian on M m involving the adapted frame metric g\u03bc\u03bd . Extrinsic contributions\nto \u0124 occur through the momentum independent potential P and through the minimally\ncoupled gauge field A\u03bc . P depends on the extrinsic geometry of the embedding of M m in\nRn and is purely quantum mechanical (i.e., does not survive in the classical limit). P was\ngenerated by rescaling the Hamiltonian to adaptive coordinates, so it represents a quantum\n\"fictitious\" force associated with the adapted frame F. In order to understand better how\nthe embedding generates the effective potential, we rewrite P in terms of the geometrically\ninvariant principal curvatures of M m . There are m principal curvatures for each normal\nvector n\u0302i given by the eigenvalues of the matrix\n(\u03b1\u0302i )\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b1i\u03bd\n\u03bc.\n\n(32)\n\nDenoting the \u03bcth principal curvature corresponding to the ith normal n\u0302i as \u03ba\u03bc,i , we introduce\nthe linear and quadratic polynomials symmetric in the \u03ba\u03bc,i for each i independently,\nX\nX\n\u03ba\u03bc,i \u03ba\u03bd,i .\n(33)\n\u03ba\u03bc,i\ns2,i =\ns1,i =\n\u03bc<\u03bd\n\n\u03bc\n\nIn terms of the s1,i and s2,i , we have\nX\n\u0001\nP = 18\ntr(\u03b1\u0302i )2 \u2212 2tr(\u03b1\u03022i ) I\ni\n\n=\n\n\u2212 18\n\nX\ni\n\n\u0001\ns21,i \u2212 4s2,i I.\n\n(34)\n\nAs first pointed out in Refs. [4] and [3], the effective potential for the cases of M 1,2 embedded\nin R3 is given by,\nP = \u2212 18 \u03ba2 I\n\n(M 1 ),\n\nP = \u2212 81 (\u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )2 I\n\n(M 2 ),\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the curvature of the curve M 1 , and \u03ba1 , \u03ba2 are the principal curvatures of M 2 .\nFor both of these cases, the effective potential is strictly negative. For the more general\ncase of M m\u22653 embedded in Rn\u2265m+1 , the effective potential can locally equal any real valued\nsmooth function defined on M m . For example, with \u03ba1,2,3 denoting principle curvatures\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n(36)\nP = \u2212 81 \u03ba3 \u03ba3 \u2212 2(\u03ba1 + \u03ba2 ) + (\u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )2 I\n\nfor the case of M 3 embedded in R4 .\nThe \"fictitious force\" potential P is nonzero for a general embedding of M 3 in Rn . The\nother geometry-dependent interaction that can appear in \u0124 is the gauge term A\u03bc . For the\n\n\f10\n\nP.C. Schuster and R.L. Jaffe\n\nsimplest 3-dimensional case of M 3 embedded in R4 , V is a 1-dimensional potential with\nnondegenerate energy eigenstates, and so A\u03bc vanishes. For M 3 embedded in Rn\u22655 , A\u03bc can\nbe nonzero when the \u03c7\u03b2 (y) are locked into a degenerate subspace of V . In the degenerate\ncases, the gauge interaction has U(1) symmetry for m = 3 and n = 5, and SO(3) symmetry\nfor m = 3 and n = 6.\nTo further illustrate the physics for a 3-dimensional manifold, consider the embedding\nof a hypersurface M 3 in R5 given by\nR(x, y, z) = (x cos \u03c1z, x sin \u03c1z, x, y, z).\n\n(37)\n\nIn this example, the x and z coordinates have been mapped onto a helical surface in a\n3-dimensional subspace of R5 and the remaining y coordinate mapping is flat. Using an\nadapted frame field\ntx = (cos \u03c1z, sin \u03c1z, 1, 0, 0)\nty = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)\ntz = (\u2212\u03c1x sin \u03c1z, \u03c1x cos \u03c1z, 0, 0, 1)\n1\nn\u03021 = \u221a (cos \u03c1z, sin \u03c1z, \u22121, 0, 0)\n2\n1\n(sin \u03c1z, \u2212 cos \u03c1z, 0, 0, \u03c1x)\nn\u03022 = p\n1 + \u03c12 x2\n\n(38)\n\nwe may calculate the nonvanishing components of the fundamental forms and obtain g\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u221a\ndiag(1, 1, 1 + \u03c12 x2 ), \u03b11\u03bc\u03bd = diag(0, 0, \u03c12 x/ 2),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c1\n0\n0 p\n1 + \u03c12 x 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n2\n\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd = \uf8ec\n(39)\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u03c1\np\n0\n0\n1 + \u03c12 x 2\np\n2 2\nand A12\nz = \u03c1/ 2 + 2\u03c1 x .

We have applied the confining potential\nformalism to the study of systems with confined degrees of freedom, and demonstrated that\nin the adiabatic limit of slowly varying curvature, the strength and representation content of\nthe gauge terms appearing in the effective theory depends crucially on the space of normal\nstates. The gauge terms vanish when the normal state is nondegenerate.\nIn addition to gauge terms, fictitious forces that depend on the extrinsic geometry of\nthe constraint manifold also appear in the effective theory. The extrinsic geometric contributions to the theory highlight a fundamental difference between confinement in classical\nversus quantum physics. In classical mechanics, dynamics on the constraint manifold is independent of the directions normal to the manifold and therefore depends only on intrinsic\ngeometry. In quantum mechanics, the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function of the system is always\nnonzero in some neighborhood of the constraint manifold and is therefore sensitive to both\nintrinsic and extrinsic geometry.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported in part by funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (D.O.E.)\nunder cooperative research agreement #DF-FC02-94ER40818.\n\n\f12\n\nP.C.
