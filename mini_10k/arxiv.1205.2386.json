Using the Geometrization Theorem we prove a result\non centralizers in fundamental groups of 3-manifolds. This result\nhad been obtained by Jaco and Shalen and by Johannson using\ndifferent techniques.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we will study centralizers in fundamental groups of 3manifolds. By a 3\u2013manifold we will always mean a compact, orientable,\nconnected, irreducible 3-manifold with empty or toroidal boundary.\nLet \u03c0 be a group. The centralizer of an element g \u2208 \u03c0 is defined to\nbe the subgroup\nC\u03c0 (g) := {h \u2208 \u03c0 | gh = hg}.\nDetermining centralizers is an important step towards understanding\na group. The goal of this note is to give a new proof of the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let N be a 3-manifold. We write \u03c0 = \u03c01 (N). Let\ng \u2208 \u03c0. If C\u03c0 (g) is non-cyclic, then one of the following holds:\n(1) there exists a JSJ torus or a boundary torus T and h \u2208 \u03c0 such\nthat g \u2208 h\u03c01 (T )h\u22121 and such that\nC\u03c0 (g) = h\u03c01 (T )h\u22121 ,\n(2) there exists a Seifert fibered component M and h \u2208 \u03c0 such that\ng \u2208 h\u03c01 (M)h\u22121 and such that\nC\u03c0 (g) = hC\u03c01 (M ) (h\u22121 gh)h\u22121 .\nIf N is Seifert fibered, then the theorem holds trivially, and if N\nis hyperbolic, then it follows from well-known properties of hyperbolic\n3-manifold groups (we refer to Section 3.1 for details). If N is neither Seifert fibered nor hyperbolic, then by the Geometrization Theorem N has a non-trivial JSJ decomposition, in particular N is Haken,\nand in that case the theorem was proved by Jaco and Shalen [8, Theorem VI.1.6] and independently by Johannson [9, Proposition 32.9].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nIn this note we will give an alternative proof of Theorem 1.1 for 3manifolds with non-trivial JSJ decomposition using the Geometrization\nTheorem proved by Perelman. Our proof involves basic facts about fundamental groups of Seifert fibered spaces and hyperbolic 3-manifolds\nand it consists of a careful study of the fundamental group of the graph\nof groups corresponding to the JSJ decomposition.\nIn order to determine centralizers of 3-manifolds it thus suffices to\nunderstand centralizers of Seifert fibered spaces. For the reader's convenience we recall the results of Jaco\u2013Shalen and Johannson. Let N be\na Seifert fibered 3-manifold with a given Seifert fiber structure. Then\nthere exists a projection map p : N \u2192 B where B is the base orbifold.\nWe denote by B \u2032 \u2192 B the orientation cover, note that this is either\n\u2032\nthe identity or a 2-fold cover. Following [8] we refer to p\u22121\n\u2217 (\u03c01 (B )) as\nthe canonical subgroup of \u03c01 (N). If f is a regular fiber of the Seifert\nfibration, then we refer to the subgroup of \u03c01 (N) generated by f as\nthe fiber subgroup. Recall that if N is non-spherical, then the fiber\nsubgroup is infinite cyclic and normal. (Note that the fact that the\nfiber subgroup is normal implies in particular that it is well-defined,\nand not just up to conjugacy.)\nRemark. Note that the definition of the canonical subgroup and of the\nfiber subgroup depend on the Seifert fiber structure. By [13, Theorem 3.8] (see also [12] and [8, II.4.11]) a Seifert fibered 3-manifold N\nadmits a unique Seifert fiber structure unless N is either covered by\nS 3 , S 2 \u00d7 R, or the 3-torus, or N = S 1 \u00d7 D 2 or if N is an I-bundle over\nthe torus or the Klein bottle.\nThe following theorem, together with Theorem 1.1, now classifies\ncentralizers of non-spherical 3-manifolds.\nTheorem 1.2. Let N be a non-spherical Seifert fibered 3-manifold with\na given Seifert fiber structure. Let g \u2208 \u03c0 = \u03c01 (N) be a non-trivial\nelement. Then the following hold:\n(1) if g lies in the fiber group, then C\u03c0 (g) equals the canonical subgroup,\n(2) if g does not lie in the fiber group, then the intersection of C\u03c0 (g)\nwith the canonical subgroup is abelian, in particular C\u03c0 (g) admits an abelian subgroup of index at most two,\n(3) if g does not lie in the canonical subgroup, then C\u03c0 (g) is infinite\ncyclic.\nThe first statement is [8, Proposition II.4.5]. The second and the\nthird statement follow from [8, Proposition II.4.7]. Using Theorems\n1.1 and 1.2 one can now immediately obtain results on root structures\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n3\n\nand the divisibility of elements in 3-manifold groups. We refer to [1,\nSection 4] for details.\nNote that given a group \u03c0 and an element g \u2208 \u03c0 the set of conjugacy\nclasses of g is in a canonical bijection to the set \u03c0/Cg (\u03c0). We thus\nobtain the following corollary to Theorem 1.1.\nTheorem 1.3. Let N be a 3\u2013manifold. If N is not a Seifert fibered\n3\u2013manifold, then the number of conjugacy classes is infinite for any\ng \u2208 \u03c01 (N).\nThis result was first obtained by de la Harpe and Pr\u00e9aux [5] using\ndifferent methods. They consider a slightly larger class of 3\u2013manifolds,\nbut extending our approach to the class of 3\u2013manifolds considered in\n[5] poses no problems. We also refer to [5] for an application of this\nresult to the von Neumann algebra W\u03bb\u2217 (\u03c01 (N)).\nAcknowledgment. We would like to thank Matthias Aschenbrenner, Pierre de la Harpe, Saul Schleimer, Stephan Tillmann and Henry\nWilton for helpful conversations.\n2. Graphs of groups\nIn this section we summarize some basic definitions and facts concerning graphs of groups and their fundamental groups. We refer to\n[2, 3, 14] for missing details.\n2.1. Graphs. A graph Y consists of a set V = V (Y) of vertices and\na set E = E(Y) of edges, and two maps E \u2192 V \u00d7 V : e 7\u2192 (o(e), t(e))\nand E \u2192 E : e 7\u2192 e, subject to the following condition: for each e \u2208 E\nwe have e = e, e 6= e, and o(e) = t(e). We sometimes also denote e by\ne\u22121 . Throughout this paper, all graphs are understood to be connected\nand finite (i.e., their vertex sets and edge sets are finite).\n2.2. The fundamental group of a graph of groups. Let Y be a\ngraph. A graph G of groups based on Y consists of families {Gv }v\u2208V (Y)\nand {Ge }e\u2208E(Y) of groups satisfying Ge = Ge for every e \u2208 E(Y),\ntogether with a family {\u03c6e }e\u2208E(Y) of monomorphisms \u03c6e : Ge \u2192 Gt(e)\n(e \u2208 E(Y)). We will refer to Y as the underlying graph of G.\nLet G be a graph of groups based on a graph Y. We recall the\nconstruction of the fundamental group G = \u03c01 (G) of G from [14, I.5.1].\nFirst, consider the path group \u03c0(G) which is generated by the groups\nGv (v \u2208 V (Y)) and the elements e \u2208 E(Y) subject to the relations\ne\u03c6e (g)e = \u03c6e (g)\n\n(e \u2208 E(Y), g \u2208 Ge ).\n\n\f4\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nBy a path in Y from a vertex v to a vertex w we mean a sequence\n(e1 , e2 , . . . , en ) where o(e1 ) = v, t(ei ) = o(ei+1 ), i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 and\nt(en ) = w.\nBy a path in G from a vertex v to a vertex w we mean a sequence\n(g0 , e1 , g1, e2 , . . . , en , gn ),\nof elements in E where (e1 , . . . , en ) is a path of length n in Y from v to\nw and where g0 \u2208 Gv and where gi \u2208 Gt(ei ) for i = 1, . . . , n. We write\nl(\u03b3) = n and call it the length of \u03b3. We say that the path \u03b3 represents\nthe element\ng = g0 e1 g1 e2 * * * en gn\nof \u03c0(G).\nLet now w be a fixed vertex of Y. We will refer to a path from\nw to w as a loop based at w. The fundamental group \u03c01 (G, w) of G\n(with base point w) is defined to be the subgroup of \u03c0(G) consisting\nof elements represented by loops based at w. If w \u2032 \u2208 V (Y) is another\nbase point, and g is an element of \u03c0(G) represented by a path from\nw \u2032 to w, then \u03c01 (G, w \u2032) \u2192 \u03c01 (G, w) : t 7\u2192 g \u22121 tg is an isomorphism. By\nabuse of notation we write \u03c01 (G) to denote \u03c01 (G, w) if the particular\nchoice of base point is irrelevant.\nNow let v \u2208 V . Pick a path g from v to w. Then the map Gv \u2192\n\u03c01 (G, w) given by t 7\u2192 g \u22121 tg defines a group morphism which is injective\n(see again [14, I.5.2, Corollary 1]). In particular the vertex groups\ndefine subgroups of \u03c01 (G, w) which are well-defined up to conjugation.\nGiven a graph of groups G and a base vertex w it is always understood\nthat for each vertex v we picked once and for all a path from v to w.\nWe will later on make use of the following operations on paths. Given\na path p in G from v1 to v2 we write o(p) = v1 and t(p) = v2 . Given\ntwo paths\np := (g0 , e1 , g1 , e2 , . . . , en , gn ), and\nq := (h0 , f1 , h1 , f2 , . . . , fm , hm ),\nwith t(p) = o(q) we define\np \u2217 q := (g0 , e1 , g1 , e2 , . . . , en , gn * h0 , f1 , h1 , f2 , . . . , fm , hm )\nwhich is a path from o(p) to t(q). Furthermore, given a path\np := (g0 , e1 , g1 , e2 , . . . , en , gn )\nwe define the inverse path to be\np\u22121 := (gn\u22121 , en , . . . , g1\u22121 , e1 , g0\u22121).\nNote that p\u22121 is a path from t(p) to o(p).\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n5\n\n2.3. Reduced paths. A path (g0 , e1 , g1 , e2 , . . . , en , gn ) in G is reduced\nif it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n(1) n = 0, or\n(2) n > 0 and gi \u2208\n/ \u03c6ei (Gei ) for each index i such that ei+1 = ei .\nGiven g \u2208 \u03c0(G) we define its length l(g) to be the length of a reduced\npath representing it. Note that this is well-defined (see [14, p. 4]), i.e.\nany g is represented by a reduced path and the definition is independent\nof the choice of the reduced path. Also note that\nl(g) = min{l(p) | p a path which represents g}.\nNote that l(g) = 0 if and only if g lies in Gv for some v \u2208 V .\nWe say that s = (g0 , e1 , g1, e2 , . . . , en , gn ) is cyclically reduced if s is\nreduced and if one of the following holds:\n(1) n = 0, or\n(2) e1 =\n6 en , or\n(3) e1 = en but gn g0 is not conjugate to an element in Im(\u03c6en ).\nNote that a reduced loop s = (g0 , e1 , g1 , e2 , . . . , en , gn ) is cyclically reduced if and only if the element it represents has minimal length in its\nconjugacy class in the path group \u03c0(G).\nWe say that g \u2208 \u03c01 (G, w) is cyclically reduced if there exists a cyclically reduced loop which represents it. It is straightforward to see that\ng is cyclically reduced if and only if any reduced loop representing it\nis cyclically reduced. Also note that if g is cyclically reduced, then\nl(g n ) = n * l(g).\nAny element g of the path groups \u03c0(G) is conjugate in \u03c0(G) to a\ncyclically reduced element s, we can thus define cl(g) = l(s). Note\nthat this is independent of the choice of s. Note that if g is cyclically\nreduced, then a straightforward argument shows that l(g n ) = n * l(g).\nIn particular given any g we have cl(g n ) = n * cl(g).\n3. Fundamental groups of 3-manifolds\nIn the next two sections we cover properties of fundamental groups\nof hyperbolic 3-manifold groups and of Seifert fibered spaces, before we\nreturn to the study of 3-manifold groups in general.\n3.1. Fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Let N be\na 3-manifold. We say that N is hyperbolic if the interior admits a\ncomplete metric of finite volume and constant sectional curvature equal\nto \u22121.\n\n\f6\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nThroughout this section we write\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u03b5 a\nU :=\nwith \u03b5 \u2208 {\u22121, 1} and a \u2208 C \u2282 SL(2, C).\n0 \u03b5\nNote that U is an abelian subgroup of SL(2, C). Recall that A \u2208\nSL(2, C) is called parabolic if it is conjugate to an element in U. We\nsay that A is loxodromic if A is diagonalizable with eigenvalues \u03bb, \u03bb\u22121\nsuch that |\u03bb| > 1. We recall the following well known proposition.\nProposition 3.1. Let N be a hyperbolic 3-manifold. Then the following hold:\n(1) There exists a faithful discrete representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (N) \u2192 SL(2, C).\n(2) Let g \u2208 \u03c01 (N), then \u03c1(g) is either parabolic or loxodromic.\n(3) An element g \u2208 \u03c01 (N) is conjugate to an element in a boundary\ncomponent if and only if \u03c1(g) is parabolic.\n(4) Let T be a boundary torus, then there exists a matrix P \u2208\nSL(2, C) such that P \u03c1(\u03c01 (T ))P \u22121 \u2282 U.\n(5) Let g \u2208 \u03c01 (N). Then Cg (\u03c01 (N)) is either infinite cyclic or a\nfree abelian group of rank two. The latter case occurs precisely\nwhen g is conjugate to an element in a boundary component T\nand in that case Cg (\u03c01 (N)) is a conjugate of \u03c01 (T ).\nWe include the proof of the proposition for completeness' sake.\nProof.\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\n(1) A hyperbolic 3-manifold N admits a faithful discrete representation \u03c01 (N) \u2192 Isom(H3 ) = PSL(2, C). Thurston (see [15,\nSection 1.6]) showed that this representation lifts to a faithful\ndiscrete representation \u03c01 (N) \u2192 SL(2, C).\nThis follows immediately from considering the Jordan transform\nof \u03c1(g) and from the fact that the infinite cyclic group generated\nby \u03c1(g) is discrete in SL(2, C).\nThis is well-known, see e.g. [10, p. 115].\nThis statement follows easily from the fact that \u03c01 (T ) \u2282 SL(2, C)\nis a discrete subgroup isomorphic to Z2 .\nBy (1) we can view \u03c0 = \u03c01 (N) as a discrete, torsion-free subgroup of SL(2, C). Note that the centralizer of any non-trivial\nmatrix in SL(2, C) is abelian (this can be seen easily using the\nJordan normal form of such a matrix). Now let g \u2208 \u03c0 \u2282\nSL(2, C) be non-trivial. Since \u03c0 is torsion-free and discrete in\nSL(2, C) it follows easily that C\u03c0 (g) is in fact either infinite\ncyclic or a free abelian group of rank two. It now follows from\n[16, Proposition 5.4.4] (see also [13, Corollary 4.6] for the closed\ncase) that there exists a boundary component S and h \u2208 \u03c01 (N)\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n7\n\nsuch that\nC\u03c0 (g) = h\u03c01 (S)h\u22121 .\n\u0003\nGiven a group \u03c0 we say that an element g is divisible by an integer\nn if there exists an h \u2208 \u03c0 with g = hn . We say g is infinitely divisible\nif g is divisible by infinitely many integers. The following lemma is an\nimmediate consequences of Proposition 3.1 (5).\nLemma 3.2. Let \u03c0 \u2282 SL(2, C) be a discrete torsion-free group. Then \u03c0\ndoes not contain any non-trivial elements which are infinitely divisible.\nLet \u03c0 be a group. We say that a subgroup H \u2282 \u03c0 is division closed\nif for any g \u2208 \u03c0 and n > 0 with g n \u2208 H the element g already lies in H.\nThe following lemma is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3.1\n(2) and (5) and from the observation that A \u2282 SL(2, C) is parabolic\n(respectively loxodromic) if and only if a non-trivial power of A is\nparabolic (respectively loxodromic).\nLemma 3.3. Let N be a 3-manifold such that the interior of N is a\nhyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume. Let T be a boundary component\nof N. Then \u03c01 (T ) \u2282 \u03c01 (N) is division closed.\nLet \u03c0 be a group. We say that a subgroup H is malnormal if gHg \u22121 \u2229\nH is trivial for any g 6\u2208 H. The following lemma is well-known.\nLemma 3.4. Let N be a hyperbolic 3-manifold.\n(1) Let T be a boundary torus. Then \u03c01 (T ) \u2282 \u03c01 (N) is malnormal.\n(2) Let T1 and T2 be distinct boundary tori. Then for any g \u2208 \u03c01 (N)\nwe have \u03c01 (T1 ) \u2229 g\u03c01 (T2 )g \u22121 = {e}.\n3.2. Fundamental groups of Seifert fibered manifolds. Let N\nbe a Seifert fibered space with regular fiber c. First note that if T is\na boundary torus, then the Seifert fibration restricted to T induces a\nproduct structure. It follows that c \u2208 \u03c01 (T ) and that c is indivisible in\n\u03c01 (T ) \u223c\n= Z2 .\nThe following results summarize the key properties of fundamental\ngroups of Seifert fibered spaces which are relevant to our discussion.\nTheorem 3.5. Let N be a Seifert fibered 3-manifold with regular fiber\nc. Then there exists an s \u2208 N with the following property: If T is\na boundary component, and if g 6\u2208 \u03c01 (T ) but some power of g lies in\n\u03c01 (T ), then there exists d \u2264 s such that g d = c or g d = c\u22121 .\nProof. Let N be a Seifert fibered 3-manifold with boundary. Let s be\nthe maximum order of a singular fiber of the fibration. Let T be a\n\n\f8\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nboundary component, and let g 6\u2208 \u03c01 (T ) such that some power of g lies\nin \u03c01 (T ). We denote by p : N \u2192 B the projection to the base orbifold.\nWe denote by b the boundary curve of B corresponding to T . Note\nthat p(g) 6\u2208 hbi but a power of p(g) lies in hbi. It follows easily from [8,\nRemark II.3.1] that p(g) is of finite order. In particular g corresponds\nto a singular fiber, and then it follows from the definition of s that\nthere exists a d \u2264 s such that g d = c or g d = c\u22121 .\n\u0003\nLemma 3.6. Let N be a Seifert fibered 3-manifold with regular fiber\nc and let T be a boundary component. Let g \u2208 \u03c01 (T ) which is not a\npower of c, then Cg (\u03c01 (N)) = \u03c01 (T ).\nProof. We denote by p : N \u2192 B the projection to the base orbifold.\nNote that p(g) \u2208 \u03c01 (B) is non-trivial. It follows easily from [8, Remark II.3.1] that Cp(g) (\u03c01 (B)) is the group generated by the boundary\ncurve of N corresponding to T . It follows easily that Cg (\u03c01 (N)) =\n\u03c01 (T ).\n\u0003\nThe following lemma is also well-known. It can be proved in a similar\nfashion as Lemma 3.6 by considering the equivalent problem in the\nfundamental group of the base manifold.\nLemma 3.7. Let N be a Seifert fibered 3-manifold. Denote by c \u2208\n\u03c01 (N) the element represented by a regular fiber.\n(1) Let T be a boundary torus and g \u2208 \u03c01 (N) \\ \u03c01 (T ), then \u03c01 (T ) \u2229\ng\u03c01 (T )g \u22121 = hci.\n(2) Let T1 and T2 be distinct boundary tori. Then for any g \u2208 \u03c01 (N)\nwe have \u03c01 (T1 ) \u2229 g\u03c01 (T2 )g \u22121 = hci.\nWe conclude with the following lemma.\nLemma 3.8. Let N be a non-spherical Seifert fibered manifold. Then\n\u03c01 (N) does not contain non-trivial elements which are infinitely divisible.\nProof. Let N be a Seifert fibered manifold. Then there exists a finite\ncover N \u2032 which is an S 1 -bundle over a surface S (see e.g. [7, p. 391]\nfor details). We write \u0393 = \u03c01 (S), \u03c0 = \u03c01 (N) and \u03c0 \u2032 = \u03c01 (N \u2032 ). If N is\nnon-spherical then the long exact sequence in homotopy implies that\nthere exists a short exact sequence\n1 \u2192 Z \u2192 \u03c0 \u2032 \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 1.\nSince Z and \u0393 are well-known not to admit any non-trivial infinitely\ndivisible elements, it follows easily that \u03c0 \u2032 does not admit a non-trivial\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n9\n\ninfinitely divisible element. We write n = [\u03c0 : \u03c0 \u2032 ]. Since N is nonspherical we know that \u03c0 is torsion-free. Note that if g \u2208 \u03c0 is nontrivial, then g n lies in \u03c0 \u2032 and it is also non-trivial. It is now easy\nto see that \u03c0 can not admit a non-trivial infinitely divisible element\neither.\n\u0003\n3.3. 3-manifolds and graphs of groups. In this section we recall\nthe well-known interpretation of 3-manifold groups as the fundamental\ngroup of a graph of groups. Let N be an irreducible, closed, oriented 3manifold. Recall that the JSJ tori are a minimal collection {T1 , . . . , Tk }\nof tori such that the complements of the tori are either atoroidal or\nSeifert fibered.\nWe denote by G(N) the corresponding JSJ graph, i.e. the vertex\nset V = V (G) of G consists of the set of components of N cut along\nT1 , . . . , Tk pieces and the set E = E(G) of (unoriented) edges consists\nof the set of JSJ tori T1 , . . . , Tk . We sometimes denote the JSJ tori by\nTe , e \u2208 E and we denote the components of N cut along \u222ae\u2208E Te by\nNv , v \u2208 V . We equip each Te with an orientation, we thus obtain two\ncanonical embeddings i\u00b1 of Te into N cut along Te . We then denote\nby o(e) \u2208 V the unique vertex with i\u2212 (Te ) \u2208 Ni(e) and we denote by\nt(e) \u2208 V the unique vertex with i+ (Te ) \u2208 Nf (e) .\nSuppose that N has a non-trivial JSJ decomposition. Then given a\nSeifert fibered component Nv of the JSJ decomposition of N we denote\nby cv \u2208 \u03c01 (Nv ) the group element defined by a corresponding regular\nfiber. Note that cv is well-defined up to inversion (see [17, Lemma 1]\nor [4]).\nWe conclude this section with the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.9. Let N be a closed, oriented 3-manifold. Denote by\nG = G(N) the corresponding JSJ graph. If e is an edge such that o(e)\n\u00b11\nand t(e) correspond to Seifert fibered spaces, then \u03c6\u22121\ne (ct(e) ) 6= co(e) .\n\u00b11\nProof. If \u03c6\u22121\ne (ct(e) ) was equal to co(e) , then No(e) and Nt(e) would have\nSeifert fiber structures which (after an isotopy) match along the edge\ntorus. But this contradicts the minimality of the JSJ decomposition.\n\u0003\n\n4. Proof of the main results\n4.1. Divisibility in 3-manifold groups. We will first prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.1. Let N be a 3-manifold. If N is not spherical, then\n\u03c01 (N) does not contain any non-trivial elements which are infinitely\ndivisible.\n\n\f10\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nProof. Let N be a non-spherical 3-manifold and let x \u2208 \u03c01 (N) be a nontrivial element. Since the statement of theorem is independent of the\nchoice of base point and conjugation we can without loss of generality\nassume that l(x) = cl(x). We write l = l(x).\nFirst suppose that l > 0. Suppose we have y \u2208 \u03c01 (N) and n such\nthat y n = x. Note that 0 < cl(x) = cl(y n ) = n * cl(y). It now follows\nimmediately that n \u2264 l = cl(x).\nNow suppose that l = 0. Note that this means that x lies in a vertex\ngroup \u03c01 (Nw ). We now define\nd := max{n \u2208 N | x = y n for some y \u2208 \u03c01 (Nw )}.\nNote that d < \u221e by Lemmas 3.2 and 3.8. Furthermore, given a Seifert\nfibered component Nv we define\nsv := maximum of the orders of the singular fibers of Nv .\nFinally we define s to be the maximum over all sv . If there are no\nSeifert fibered components, then we set s = 1. The following claim\nnow implies the theorem.\nClaim. If there exists y \u2208 \u03c01 (N) and n \u2208 N with y n = x, then n \u2264 ds.\nSuppose we have y \u2208 \u03c01 (N) and n such that y n = x. Note that\n0 = l(x) = cl(x) = cl(y n ) = n * cl(y). It now follows that cl(y) = 0. If\nl(y) = 0, then y \u2208 \u03c01 (Nw ), hence the conclusion holds trivially by the\ndefinition of d. Now suppose that l(y) > 0. Then there exists a reduced\npath p = (g0 , e1 , g1, . . . , el , gl ) from w to a vertex v and z \u2208 \u03c01 (Nv ) such\nthat y is represented by p \u2217 z \u2217 p\u22121 . Among all such pairs (p, z) we pick\na pair which minimizes the length of p.\nSince p is minimal and l(p) > 0 we see that gl zgl\u22121 6\u2208 Im(\u03c6el ). On the\nother hand p \u2217 z n \u2217 p\u22121 represents y n = x, hence this path is reduced,\nwhich implies that gl z n gl\u22121 \u2208 Im(\u03c6el ). It follows that Im(\u03c6el ) is not\ndivision closed, using Lemma 3.3 we conclude that Nv is Seifert fibered.\nWe denote by cv the regular fiber of Nv . Recall that by Theorem 3.5\nthere exists r|sv with gl z r gl\u22121 = cv . It also follows from Theorem 3.5\nthat gl z n gl\u22121 = cm\nv \u2208 Im(\u03c6el ) for some m. Note that n = mr.\nWe can now apply Lemmas 3.4 and 3.7, Theorem 3.9 and the fact\nthat p is reduced to conclude that\nm \u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n(g0 , e1 , g1 , . . . , el\u22121 , gl\u22121 \u03c6\u22121\nel (cv )gl\u22121 , el\u22121 , . . . , g1 , e1 , g0 )\n\nis reduced. It follows that l = 1. Note that\nm \u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121 m\nx = g0 \u03c6\u22121\ne1 (cv )g0 = (g0 \u03c6e1 (cv )g0 ) .\n\nIt follows that m \u2264 d. We also have r \u2264 sv \u2264 s. We now conclude that\nn = mr \u2264 ds.\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n11\n\n\u0003\n4.2. Commuting elements in 3-manifold groups.\nTheorem 4.2. Let N be a 3-manifold. Let x, y \u2208 \u03c01 (N) with x =\nyxy \u22121. Then one of the following holds:\n(1) x and y generate a cyclic group in \u03c01 (N), or\n(2) there exists a JSJ torus T such that x and y lie in a conjugate\nof \u03c01 (T ) \u2282 \u03c01 (N), or\n(3) there exists a Seifert fibered component M of the JSJ decomposition such that x and y lie in a conjugate of \u03c01 (M) \u2282 \u03c01 (N).\nProof. Let N be a 3-manifold. Denote by G = G(N) the corresponding\nJSJ graph with vertex set V and edge set E. We denote by w \u2208 V\nthe vertex which contains the base point of N. We denote the vertex\ngroups by Gv = \u03c01 (Nv ), v \u2208 V .\nThe theorem holds trivially for Seifert fibered spaces, we can therefore assume that N is not a Seifert fibered space, in particular that N\nis not spherical. Suppose we have x, y \u2208 \u03c01 (N) with x = yxy \u22121. By\nthe symmetry of x and y we can without loss of generality assume that\ncl(x) \u2264 cl(y). Note that the statement of the theorem does not change\nunder conjugation and change of base point, we can therefore without\nloss of generality assume that cl(x) = l(x).\nWe represent y by a reduced loop p = (h0 , f1 , h1 , . . . , fl\u22121 , hl\u22121 , fl , hl )\nbased at w. If l = 0, then l(x) = 0 as well since l(x) = cl(x) \u2264 cl(y) \u2264\nl(y) = 0. In that case we are done by Proposition 3.1 (5). We thus\nhenceforth only consider the case that l \u2265 1.\nAfter conjugating x and y with hl we can without loss of generality\nassume that hl = 1. Recall that p being reduced implies that for\ni = 2, . . . , l the following holds:\n(4.1)\n\nfi 6= fi\u22121 or fi = fi\u22121 and hi\u22121 6\u2208 Im(\u03c6fi\u22121 ).\n\nWe first study the case that l(x) = 0, i.e. x \u2208 Gw . Clearly we can\nassume that x is non-trivial.\nNow consider\n\u22121\n\u22121\np \u2217 x \u2217 p\u22121 = (h0 , f1 , h1 , . . . , fl , x, fl\u22121 , . . . , h\u22121\n1 , f1 , h0 ).\n\nThis path is not reduced since yxy \u22121 can be represented by a path\nof length zero. It follows that x \u2208 Im(\u03c6fl ). We can now represent\nx = yxy \u22121 by the following path:\n(4.2)\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(h0 , f1 , h1 , . . . , fl\u22121 , hl\u22121 \u03c6\u22121\nfl (x)hl\u22121 , fl\u22121 , . . . , h1 , f1 , h0 ).\n\nCase 1: l = 1, i.e. y = (h0 , f1 , 1). In that case yxy \u22121 = x is represented\n\u22121\n\u22121\nby h0 \u03c6\u22121\nf1 (x)h0 . It follows that x \u2208 Im(\u03c6f1 ) and x \u2208 h0 Im(\u03c6f1 )h0 .\n\n\f12\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nBut if t(f1 ) = o(f1 ) is hyperbolic this is not possible by Lemma 3.4 since\nthe two boundary tori of Nt(f1 ) = No(f1 ) corresponding to the edge f1\nare obviously different. If t(f1 ) = o(f1 ) is Seifert fibered, then we can\nsimilarly exclude this case by appealing to Lemma 3.7 and Theorem\n3.9.\nCase 2: The vertex o(fl ) is hyperbolic. It follows easily from (4.1) and\nLemma 3.4 that the path (4.2) is reduced. Since the path represents x\nthis implies in particular that l = 1. We thus reduced Case 2 to Case\n1.\nCase 3: The vertex o(fl ) is Seifert fibered and \u03c6\u22121\nfl (x) 6\u2208 hco(fl ) i. Note\nthat Lemma 3.7 together with Theorem 3.9 and (4.1) implies that the\npath (4.2) is reduced, i.e. l = 1. We thus also reduced Case 3 to Case\n1.\nCase 4: The vertex o(fl ) is Seifert fibered, \u03c6\u22121\nfl (x) \u2208 hco(fl ) i and l >\n\u22121\n1. Note that by Theorem 3.5 (2) this implies that hl\u22121 \u03c6\u22121\nfl (x)hl\u22121 \u2208\nIm(\u03c6fl\u22121 ). We can thus represent x by\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(h0 , f1 , . . . , fl\u22122 , hl\u22122 * \u03c6\u22121\nfl\u22121 (hl\u22121 \u03c6fl (x)hl\u22121 ) * hl\u22122 , fl\u22122 , . . . , f1 , h0 ).\n\nIf o(fl\u22121 ) is hyperbolic, then the argument of Case 2 immediately shows\nthat l = 2. If o(fl\u22121 ) is Seifert fibered, then it follows from Theorems 3.5\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nand 3.9 and from Lemma 3.7 (2) that hl\u22122 *\u03c6\u22121\nfl\u22121 (hl\u22121 \u03c6fl (x)hl\u22121 )*hl\u22122 6\u2208\nhco(fl\u22121 ) i. The argument of Case 3 immediately shows that again l = 2.\nWe now showed that l = 2, we thus see that x equals\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nh0 * \u03c6\u22121\nfl\u22121 (hl\u22121 \u03c6fl (x)hl\u22121 ) * h0 .\n\nIf o(f1 ) = t(f2 ) is hyperbolic, then x \u2208 Im(\u03c6f2 ) and x \u2208 h0 Im(\u03c6f1 )h\u22121\n0 .\nIt follows from Lemma 3.4 that f1 = f2 and h0 \u2208 Im(\u03c6f1 ). If we\nchange the base point to o(f2 ) = t(f1 ) we see that x is represented\nby \u03c6\u22121\nf2 (x) \u2208 Go(f2 ) and y is represented by \u03c6f1 (h0 )h1 \u2208 Go(f2 ) . If on\nthe other hand o(f1 ) = t(f2 ) is Seifert fibered, then it follows from\nTheorem 3.9 that x 6\u2208 hct(f2 ) i. It now follows easily from Lemma 3.7\nthat f1 = f2 and h0 \u2208 Im(\u03c6f1 ). We conclude the argument as above.\nWe now turn to the case that l(x) > 0. We claim that Conclusion\n(1) holds. By Theorem 4.1 we can find z \u2208 \u03c01 (N) which is indivisible\nand n > 0 with x = z n . Without loss of generality assume that z is\ncyclically reduced. We claim that y is a power of z as well. We represent\nz by a reduced loop q = (g0 , e1 , g1 , . . . , ek , gk ). We now consider the\npath p \u2217 q n \u2217 p\u22121 which is given by\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(h0 , f1 , h1 , . . . , fl , hl * g0 , e1 , g1 , . . . , ek , gk * h\u22121\nl , fl , . . . , h1 , f1 , h0 ).\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n13\n\nThis loop has to be reduced since l > 0 and therefore the loop is longer\nthan the loop q n which represents the same element. We conclude that\none of the following conditions hold:\n(1) fl = e1 and hl g0 \u2208 Im(\u03c6fl ), or\n(2) ek = fl and gk h\u22121\n\u2208 Im(\u03c6ek ).\nl\nNote though that not both conclusions can hold, otherwise x would\nnot be cyclically reduced. Now suppose that (1) holds and (2) does not\nhold. A straightforward induction argument now shows that p = p\u2032 \u2217q \u22121\nfor some reduced path p\u2032 . On the other hand, if (2) holds and (1)\ndoes not hold, then a straightforward induction argument shows that\np = q \u22121 \u2217 p\u2032 for some reduced path p\u2032 .\nClaim. If l(p\u2032 ) = 0, then p\u2032 represents the trivial element.\nIf l(p\u2032 ) = 0, then we denote by y \u2032 the element represented by p\u2032 .\nSuppose that y \u2032 is non-trivial. In that case we have y \u2032 xn (y \u2032)\u22121 = xn\nfor any n, in particular xn y \u2032x\u2212n = y \u2032. It follows from the discussion of\nCases 1, 2, 3 and 4 above that l(xn ) \u2264 2 for any n. Since x is cyclically\nreduced and l(x) > 0 this case can not occur. This concludes the proof\nof the claim.\nIf p\u2032 represents the trivial element we are clearly done. If not, then\nl(p\u2032 ) > 0 and we can do an induction argument on the length of p\u2032 to\nshow that y is in fact a power of z.\n\u0003\n4.3. Malnormality of peripheral subgroups. Using the methods\nof the proof of Theorem 4.2 we can now also prove the following theorem\nwhich was first proved by de la Harpe and Weber [6].\nTheorem 4.3. Let N be a compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold\nwith toroidal boundary and S a boundary component. If the JSJ component which contains S is hyperbolic, then \u03c01 (S) \u2282 \u03c01 (N) is malnormal.\nProof. Let N be a compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold with\ntoroidal boundary and S a boundary component. We denote by G =\nG(N) the corresponding JSJ graph with vertex set V and edge set E.\nSuppose that the JSJ component Nw which contains S is hyperbolic.\nNow let x \u2208 \u03c01 (S) and g \u2208 \u03c01 (N) \\ \u03c01 (S).\nWe pick a base point on S. We represent g by a reduced loop p =\n(h0 , f1 , h1 , . . . , fl\u22121 , hl\u22121 , fl , hl ) based at w. If l = 0, then g \u2208 \u03c01 (Nw ),\nbut since \u03c01 (S) \u2282 \u03c01 (Nw ) is malnormal by Lemma 3.4 (1) it follows\nthat gxg \u22121 6\u2208 \u03c01 (S). Now suppose that l > 0. We consider the path\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\np \u2217 x \u2217 p\u22121 = (h0 , f1 , h1 , . . . , fl , hl xh\u22121\nl , fl , . . . , h1 , f1 , h0 ).\n\nThis path is reduced if and only if x \u2208 Im(\u03c6fl ). But Im(\u03c6fl ) is the\nimage of a boundary torus in Nw distinct from S. It now follows from\n\n\f14\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL\n\nLemma 3.4 (2) that hl xh\u22121\n6\u2208 Im(\u03c6fl ). We conclude that the path\nl\n\u22121\np \u2217 x \u2217 p is reduced, i.e. gxg \u22121 does not lie in \u03c01 (Nw ), let alone in\n\u03c01 (S).\n\u0003\n4.4. Proof of Theorem 1.1. For the reader's convenience we recall\nthe statement of Theorem 1.1.\nTheorem 4.4. Let N be a 3-manifold. We write \u03c0 = \u03c01 (N). Let\ng \u2208 \u03c0. If C\u03c0 (g) is non-cyclic, then one of the following holds:\n(1) there exists a JSJ torus or a boundary torus T and h \u2208 \u03c0 such\nthat g \u2208 h\u03c01 (T )h\u22121 and such that\nC\u03c0 (g) = h\u03c01 (T )h\u22121 ,\n(2) there exists a Seifert fibered component M and h \u2208 \u03c0 such that\ng \u2208 h\u03c01 (M)h\u22121 and such that\nC\u03c0 (g) = hC\u03c01 (M ) (h\u22121 gh)h\u22121 .\nProof. Let N be a 3-manifold and let g \u2208 \u03c0 = \u03c01 (N). If for any\nh \u2208 C\u03c0 (g) the group generated by g and h is cyclic, then either C\u03c0 (g)\nis cyclic, or g is infinitely divisible. Since the former case is excluded\nby Theorem 4.1 the latter case has to hold.\nNow suppose that C\u03c0 (g) is not cyclic and suppose that there exist\nan h \u2208 C\u03c0 (g) such that the group generated by g and h is not cyclic. It\nfollows from Theorem 4.2 that one of the following three cases occurs:\n(1) there exists a JSJ torus T such that g lies in a conjugate of\n\u03c01 (T ) \u2282 \u03c01 (N),\n(2) there exists a Seifert fibered component M of the JSJ decomposition such that g lies in a conjugate of \u03c01 (M) \u2282 \u03c01 (N),\nFirst suppose there exists a JSJ torus T such that g lies in a conjugate\nof \u03c01 (T ) \u2282 \u03c01 (N). Without loss of generality we can assume that\ng \u2208 \u03c01 (T ). We first consider the case that the two JSJ components\nabutting T are different. We denote these two components by M1 and\nM2 . By Proposition 3.1 (5) the following claim implies the theorem in\nthis case.\nClaim. There exists an i \u2208 {1, 2} such that\nC\u03c0 (g) = C\u03c01 (Mi ) (g).\nLet h \u2208 C\u03c0 (g). It follows easily from the proof of Theorem 4.2 that\neither h \u2208 \u03c01 (M1 ) or h \u2208 \u03c01 (M2 ). If M1 is hyperbolic, then it follows\nfrom Lemma 3.2 and from Proposition 3.1 (5) that h \u2208 \u03c01 (T ). It\nfollows that C\u03c0 (g) = C\u03c01 (M2 ) (g). Similarly we deal with the case that\nM2 is hyperbolic. Finally assume that M1 and M2 are Seifert fibered.\n\n\fCENTRALIZERS IN 3-MANIFOLD GROUPS\n\n15\n\nWe denote by c1 and c2 the regular fibers of M1 and M2 . If g is not a\npower of c1 , then it follows from Lemma 3.6 that C\u03c0 (g) = C\u03c01 (M2 ) (g),\nsimilarly if g is not a power of c2 . Recall that c1 and c2 are indivisible\nin \u03c01 (T ) and that by Theorem 3.9 we have c1 6= c\u00b11\n2 . It follows that g\nis either not a power of c1 or not a power of c2 .\nThe case that the torus is non-separating can be dealt with similarly.\nWe leave this to the reader. Also, if there exists a Seifert fibered component M of the JSJ decomposition such that g lies in a conjugate of\n\u03c01 (M) \u2282 \u03c01 (N) and such that g does not lie in the image of a boundary\ntorus, then it follows easily from the proof of Theorem 4.2 that\nC\u03c0 (g) = C\u03c01 (M ) (g).\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] M.
