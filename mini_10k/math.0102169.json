We use a natural affine connection with nontrivial torsion on an arbitrary almost-K\u00e4hler manifold which respects the\nalmost-K\u00e4hler structure to construct a Fedosov-type deformation\nquantization on this manifold.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet (M, {*, *}) be a Poisson manifold. Denote by C \u221e (M)[[\u03bd]] the\nspace of formal series in \u03bd with coefficients from C \u221e (M). Deformation\nquantization on (M, {*, *}), as defined in [1], is an associative algebra\nstructure on C \u221e (M)[[\u03bd]] with the \u03bd-linear and \u03bd-adically continuous\nproduct \u2217 (named a star-product) given on f, g \u2208 C \u221e (M) by the formula\n\u221e\nX\nf \u2217g =\n(1.1)\n\u03bd r Cr (f, g),\nr=0\n\nwhere Cr , r \u2265 0, are bilinear operators on C \u221e (M), C0 (f, g) = f g, and\nC1 (f, g) \u2212 C1 (g, f ) = i{f, g}. A star product \u2217 is called differential if\nall the operators Cr , r \u2265 0, are bidifferential.\nTwo differential star products \u2217 and \u2217\u2032 are called equivalent if there\nexists an isomorphism of algebras B : (C \u221e (M)[[\u03bd]], \u2217) \u2192 (C \u221e (M)[[\u03bd]], \u2217\u2032 ),\nwhere B = Id + \u03bdB1 + \u03bd 2 B2 + . . . and Br , r \u2265 1, are differential operators on C \u221e (M).\nIf (M, \u03c9) is a symplectic (and therefore a Poisson) manifold then to\neach differential star-product \u2217 on M one can relate its characteristic\nclass cl(\u2217) \u2208 (1/i\u03bd)[\u03c9] + H 2 (M, C)[[\u03bd]] (see [13],[27],[28],[11]). The\nequivalence classes of differential star-products on (M, \u03c9) are bijectively\nDate: February 20, 2001, rev. June 18, 2001.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The questions of existence and classification on general Poisson\nmanifolds were solved by Kontsevich in [24].\nHistorically the first examples of star products (Moyal-Weyl and\nWick star-products) were obtained from asymptotic expansions of related symbol products w.r.t. a numerical parameter ~ (the 'Planck\nconstant'), as ~ \u2192 0. Later a number of star-products on K\u00e4hler manifolds were obtained from the asymptotic expansion in ~ of the symbol product of Berezin's covariant symbols (see [7],[8],[9],[25],[26],[21]).\nThese star-products on K\u00e4hler manifolds are differential and have the\nproperty of 'separation of variables': the corresponding bidifferential\noperators Cr differentiate their first argument only in antiholomorphic\ndirections and the second argument only in holomorphic ones. The\ndeformation quantizations with separation of variables on an arbitrary\nK\u00e4hler manifold where completely described and parameterized by geometric objects, the formal deformations of the K\u00e4hler (1,1)-form (see\n[19]). The star-products obtained from the product of Berezin's covariant symbols on coadjoint orbits of compact semisimple Lie groups\nwhere identified in [21] (that is, the corresponding formal (1,1)-form\nwas calculated).\nAnother interesting case where star-products are obtained from symbol constructions is the so called Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on arbitrary compact K\u00e4hler manifolds [3],[31],[30]. In this quantization\nscheme Berezin's contravariant symbols are used (see [2]), which, in\ngeneral, do not have a well defined symbol product. The semiclassical properties of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization in [3] were proved\nwith the use of generalized Toeplitz structures developed by Guillemin\nand Boutet de Monvel in [6]. With the same technique for compact\nK\u00e4hler manifolds an associated deformation quantization, the BerezinToeplitz deformation quantization, was constructed [31],[30]. However,\nthis construction is very implicit and it is a daunting task to calculate\nwith its use the operators Cr even for small values of r. In [23] the\nBerezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization was shown to be a differentiable deformation quantization with separation of variables and its\nclassifying (1,1)-form was explicitly calculated. Thus the operators Cr\nof the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization can be calculated recursively by the simple algorithm from [19].\n\n\fALMOST K\u00c4HLER DEFORMATION QUANTIZATION\n\n3\n\nIt was shown by Guillemin in [17] that, using generalized Toeplitz\nstructures, it is even possible to construct a star-product on an arbitrary compact symplectic manifold. Later Borthwick and Uribe [5]\nintroduced a natural 'almost-K\u00e4hler quantization' on an arbitrary compact almost-K\u00e4hler manifold by defining an operator quantization of\nBerezin-Toeplitz type. From results by Guillemin and Uribe [18] it\nfollows that the generalized Toeplitz structure associated to these operators exists and the correct semi-classical limit in the almost K\u00e4hler\ncase follows like in [3]. Therefore there should exist the corresponding natural deformation quantization on an arbitrary compact almostK\u00e4hler manifold. It would be interesting to describe this deformation\nquantization directly.\nThe goal of this Letter is to show that one can construct a natural deformation quantization on an arbitrary almost-K\u00e4hler manifold using\nFedosov's machinery. To this end we use the natural affine connection introduced by Yano [32], which respects the almost-K\u00e4hler structure. This connection necessarily has a nontrivial torsion whenever the\nalmost complex structure is non-integrable. We generalize Fedosov's\nconstruction to the case of affine connections with torsion and obtain\na star-product on an arbitrary almost-K\u00e4hler manifold. In the K\u00e4hler\ncase this star-product coincides with the star-product with separation\nof variables (or of Wick type) constructed in [4]. Our considerations\nwere very much motivated by the paper [12], where the calculations\nconcerning the star-product from [4] were made in arbitrary local coordinates (rather than in holomorphic coordinates as in [4]).\nIt follows from the results obtained in [20] and [22] that the characteristic class of the star-product from [4] is (1/i\u03bd)[\u03c9] \u2212 (1/2i)\u03b5, where \u03b5\nis the canonical class of the underlying K\u00e4hler manifold. The canonical\nclass is, however, defined for any almost-complex manifold.\nWe calculate the crucial part of the characteristic class cl of the starproduct \u2217 which we have constructed on an arbitrary almost-K\u00e4hler\nmanifold, it's coefficient c0 at the zeroth degree of \u03bd. As in the K\u00e4hler\ncase, c0 (\u2217) = \u2212(1/2i)\u03b5.\nAcknowledgements. We would like to thank B. Fedosov and\nS.

KARABEGOV AND M. SCHLICHENMAIER\n\nconnection on an arbitrary almost-K\u00e4hler manifold, which respects the\nalmost-K\u00e4hler structure.\nLet (M, J, \u03c9) be an almost-K\u00e4hler manifold, i.e., a manifold M endowed with an almost-complex structure J and a symplectic form \u03c9\nwhich are compatible in the following sense, \u03c9(JX, JY ) = \u03c9(X, Y ) for\nany vector fields X, Y on M, and g(X, Y ) = \u03c9(JX, Y ) is a Riemannian\nmetric. Actually, in what follows we only require the metric g to be\nnondegenerate, but not necessarily positive definite. It is known that\non any symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) one can choose a compatible almost\ncomplex structure to make it to an almost-K\u00e4hler manifold.\nIn local coordinates {xk } on a chart U \u2282 M set\n\u2202j = \u2202/\u2202xj , J(\u2202j ) = Jjk \u2202k , \u03c9jk = \u03c9(\u2202j , \u2202k ), gjk = g(\u2202j , \u2202k ) .\nThen\n(2.1)\n\nJjk = gj\u03b1 \u03c9 \u03b1k = g k\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b1j ,\n\nwhere (g jk ) and (\u03c9 jk ) are inverse matrices for (gkl ) and (\u03c9kl ) respectively. Here, as well as in the sequel, we use the tensor rule of summation over repeated indices.\nThe Nijenhuis tensor for the complex structure J is given by the\nfollowing formula:\n(2.2)\n\nN(X, Y ) := [X, Y ] + J[JX, Y ] + J[X, JY ] \u2212 [JX, JY ],\n\nwhere X, Y are vector fields on M. In local coordinates set N(\u2202j , \u2202k ) =\nl\nNjk\n\u2202l . Formula (2.2) takes the form\n(2.3)\n\nl\n= (\u2202\u03b1 Jjl )Jk\u03b1 \u2212 (\u2202\u03b1 Jkl )Jj\u03b1 + (\u2202j Jk\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202k Jj\u03b2 )J\u03b2l .\nNjk\n\nLet X be a vector field of type (1,0) with respect to the almost-complex\nstructure J. Then it follows from formula (2.2) that\nN(X, Y ) = (1 + iJ)([X, Y ] + J[X, JY ]) .\nTherefore N(X, Y ) is of type (0,1). The latter is also true if Y is of\ntype (1,0) instead. Similarly, if X or Y is of type (0,1) then N(X, Y )\nis of type (1,0). In particular, if X and Y are of types (1,0) and (0,1)\nrespectively, then N(X, Y ) = 0. Therefore, (1 \u00b1 iJ)N((1 \u00b1 iJ)\u2202j , \u2202k ) =\n0 and N((1 \u00b1 iJ)\u2202j , (1 \u2213 iJ)\u2202k ) = 0, from whence we obtain the two\nfollowing formulas:\n(2.4)\n\n\u03b2\nl\nl\nl\nJk\u03b2 .\n= \u2212Jj\u03b1 N\u03b1\u03b2\nJ\u03b2l and Njk\n= Jj\u03b1 N\u03b1k\nNjk\n\nLet \u2207 be an arbitrary affine connection on M. In local coordinates let\nl\n\u0393ljk be its Christoffel symbols and Tjk\n= \u0393ljk \u2212 \u0393lkj the torsion tensor.\n\n\fALMOST K\u00c4HLER DEFORMATION QUANTIZATION\n\n5\n\nIn the sequel we shall need the formula\n(2.5)\n\n\u03b1\n\u2207j \u03c9kl + \u2207k \u03c9lj + \u2207l \u03c9jk = \u2212(Tjk\n\u03c9\u03b1l + Tkl\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b1j + Tlj\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b1k ),\n\nwhich easily follows from the closedness of \u03c9. Here \u2207i := \u2207\u2202i .\nBy a direct calculation we get from formula (2.3) that\n(2.6)\n\nl\nl\nNjk\n= (\u2207\u03b1 Jjl )Jk\u03b1 \u2212 (\u2207\u03b1 Jkl )Jj\u03b1 + (\u2207j Jk\u03b2 \u2212 \u2207k Jj\u03b2 )J\u03b2l \u2212 Sjk\n,\n\nwhere\n(2.7)\n\n\u03b2 l\n\u03b2 l\nl\nl\nl\nSjk\n= Tjk\n\u2212 Jj\u03b1 T\u03b1\u03b2\nJk\u03b2 + Jj\u03b1 T\u03b1k\nJ\u03b2 \u2212 Jk\u03b1 T\u03b1j\nJ\u03b2 .\n\nAssume that the connection \u2207 respects the almost-complex structure\nJ. Then formula (2.6) reduces to\nl\nl\nNjk\n= \u2212Sjk\n.\n\n(2.8)\n\nThus (2.8) is a necessary condition for \u2207 to respect the almost-complex\nstructure J.\nOne can check directly with the use of formulas (2.4) and (2.7) that\nif\nl\nl\nTjk\n= (\u22121/4)Njk\n\n(2.9)\n\nthen condition (2.8) is always satisfied.\nProposition 2.1. Let \u2207 be the unique affine connection which respects\nthe metric g and has the torsion given by formula (2.9).

A modification of Fedosov's construction\nIn this section we shall slightly modify Fedosov's construction to obtain a deformation quantization on an almost-K\u00e4hler manifold (M, J, \u03c9)\nendowed with a fixed affine connection \u2207 which respects the almostK\u00e4hler structure and has a nontrivial torsion. The existence of such a\nconnection was shown in the previous section.\nAs in Section 2, we shall work in local coordinates {xk } on a coordinate chart U \u2282 M and use the same notation.

The fibre\nproduct (3.1) can be extended to the space W \u2297 \u039b of W -valued differential forms by means of the usual exterior product of the scalar forms\n\u039b.\nWe introduce gradings deg\u03bd , degs , dega on W \u2297 \u039b defined on homogeneous elements \u03bd, y k , dxk as follows:\ndeg\u03bd (\u03bd) = 1,\n\ndegs (y k ) = 1,\n\ndega (dxk ) = 1 .\n\nAll other gradings of the elements \u03bd, y k , dxk are set to zero. The grading\ndega is induced from the standard grading on \u039b.\nThe product \u25e6 on W \u2297 \u039b is bigraded w.r.t. the grading Deg =\n2deg\u03bd + degs and the grading dega .\nThe connection \u2207 can be extended to an operator on W \u2297 \u039b such\nthat for a \u2208 W and a scalar differential form \u03bb\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202a\nl\nk \u2202a\n\u2207(a \u2297 \u03bb) :=\n(3.2)\n\u2297 (dxj \u2227 \u03bb) + a \u2297 d\u03bb.\n\u2212 \u0393jk y\n\u2202xj\n\u2202y l\n\nUsing formulas (3.1) and (3.2) one can show that \u2207 is a dega -graded\nderivation of the algebra (W \u2297 \u039b, \u25e6).\nWe introduce Fedosov's operators \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u22121 on W \u2297 \u039b as follows.\nAssume a \u2208 W \u2297 \u039b is homogeneous w.r.t. the gradings degs and dega\nwith degs (a) = p, dega (a) = q.

Then in the case when (M, J, \u03c9) is a K\u00e4hler manifold the starproduct given by Theorem 3.2 coincides with the star-product of Wick\ntype constructed in [4].\n4. Calculation of the class c0\nIt is well known that to each star-product \u2217 on a symplectic manifold\n(M, \u03c9) a formal cohomology class cl(\u2217) \u2208 (1/i\u03bd)[\u03c9] + H 2 (M, C)[[\u03bd]] is\nrelated (see, e.g., [16]). This class (named the characteristic class of\ndeformation quantization) determines the star-product up to equivalence. Denote by c0 (\u2217) the coefficient of cl(\u2217) at zeroth degree of the\nformal parameter \u03bd. The class c0 is, in some sense, the most intriguing\npart of the characteristic class cl. Only the coefficient c0 (\u2217) of the class\ncl(\u2217) = (1/i\u03bd)[\u03c9] + c0 (\u2217) + . . . can not be recovered from Deligne's\nintrinsic class. Also the cohomology class of the formal K\u00e4hler form\nparameterizing a quantization with separation of variables on a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold differs from the characteristic class of this quantization only\nin the coefficient c0 (see [20]).\nIn this section we shall calculate the class c0 of the deformation\nquantization obtained in Theorem 3.2. First we recall the definition\nof the class c0 of a star-product (1.1) (see, e.g., [20]). For a function\nf \u2208 C \u221e (M) on a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) denote by \u03bef the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. For a bilinear operator C = C(f, g)\n\n\f10\n\nA.V.

A star-product \u2217 given by (1.1) is called normalized if C1 (f, g) =\n(i/2){f, g}. For a normalized star-product \u2217 the bilinear operator C2\u2212 is\na de Rham \u2013 Chevalley 2-cocycle. There exists a unique closed 2-form \u03ba\nsuch that for all f, g \u2208 C \u221e (M) one obtains C2\u2212 (f, g) = (1/2)\u03ba(\u03bef , \u03beg ).\nThe class c0 of a normalized star-product \u2217 is defined as c0 (\u2217) := [\u03ba].\nIt is well known that each star-product on a symplectic manifold is\nequivalent to a normalized one. One defines the class c0 (\u2217) of a starproduct \u2217 as the cohomology class c0 (\u2217\u2032 ) of an equivalent normalized\nstar-product \u2217\u2032 . In order to calculate the class c0 (\u2217) of the star-product\n\u2217 from Theorem 3.2 we shall first construct an equivalent normalized\nstar-product \u2217\u2032 .\nWe introduce the fibrewise equivalence operator on W defined by the\nformula\n(4.1)\n\nG := exp (\u2212\u03bd\u2206) ,\n\nwhere \u2206 is given in local coordinates as follows:\n1 jk \u2202 2\n\u2206= g\n.\n4 \u2202y j y k\nIt is well known that the fibrewise star-product \u25e6\u2032 defined on W as\nfollows, a \u25e6\u2032 b := G(G\u22121 \u25e6 G\u22121 b), is the Weyl star-product:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\u03bd jk \u2202 2\n\u2032\na \u25e6 b (y) = exp\n(4.2)\na(y)b(z)|z=y .\n\u03c9\n2\n\u2202y j \u2202z k\nThe following formulas\n(4.3)\n\n[\u2207, \u2206] = [\u2207, G] = 0 and\n\n[\u03b4, \u2206] = [\u03b4, G] = 0\n\ncan be checked directly.\nPushing forward the Fedosov connection D obtained in Theorem 3.1\nvia G and taking into account formulas (4.3) we obtain a connection\ni\nadW eyl (r \u2032 ) ,\n\u03bd\nwhere r \u2032 = Gr and adW eyl is calculated with respect to the \u25e6\u2032 -commutator.\nDenote by WD\u2032 := ker D \u2032 \u2229 W the Fedosov subalgebra of the algebra\n(W, \u25e6\u2032 ).

It follows from the condition\nD \u2032 \u03c4 \u2032 (f ) = 0 that\n(4.6)\n\u03c4 \u2032 (f )(k+1) = \u03b4 \u22121\n\n!\nk\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\ni\nadW eyl (r \u2032 )(l+2) \u03c4 \u2032 (f )(k\u2212l) , k \u2265 0.\n\u2207\u03c4 \u2032 (f )(k) \u2212\n\u03bd l=0\n\nSince \u03c4 \u2032 (f )(0) = f , we get from (4.6) for k = 0 that \u03c4 \u2032 (f )(1) = (\u2202f /\u2202xp )y p .\nTherefore (\u2202t0 (f )/\u2202y p )|y=0 = \u2202f /\u2202xp .

We shall need the following technical lemma which can be\nproved by a straightforward calculation.\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nLemma 4.1. Let a = a2 , b = b2 be two homogeneous\n\u0010 \u0011 elements of\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\nW, (1/\u03bd)[a, b]\u25e6 = c = c0 + c2 , then c0 = \u03bd\u2206 c2 .\n\nUsing the fact that the operator G respects the total grading Deg\nand \u03b4 lowers both Deg- and degs -gradings by 1, one can obtain from\nformula (4.3), and the formula r \u2032 = Gr that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(3) \u0001\n(3)\n(3)\n\u03b4 (r \u2032 )1 = \u03b4r1 \u2212 \u03bd\u2206 \u03b4r3 .\n(4.9)\nWe get from Theorem 3.1 that\n\n\u03b4r (3) = R + \u2207r (2) \u2212\n\n(4.10)\n\ni (2) (2)\nr \u25e6r ,\n\u03bd\n\nwhere\n1\n\u03c9s\u03b1 Ttl\u03b1 y s y t dxl .\n3\n(2)\nSince the element r is of dega -degree 1, we have\ni (2) (2)\ni (2) (2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(4.11)\nr \u25e6r =\n[r , r ]\u25e6 = c(2) = c0 + c2 .\n\u03bd\n2\u03bd\nWe obtain from (4.10) and (4.11) that\nr (2) = \u03b4 \u22121 T =\n\n(4.12)\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b4r1 = \u2212c0\n\nand\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b4r3 = R + \u2207r (2) \u2212 c2 .\n\nIt follows from (4.8), (4.9), (4.12), and Lemma 4.1 that\n\u0001\ni\ns\n\u03ba = \u2212i\u2206 R + \u2207r (2) = \u2212 Jst Rtkl\n(4.13)\ndxk \u2227 dxl \u2212 i\u03bb,\n8\n\u0001\nwhere \u03bb = \u2206 \u2207r (2) . Introduce a global differential one-form \u03bc =\n(1/6)Jst Ttls dxl on M. A direct calculation shows that \u03bb = d\u03bc, therefore\nthe form \u03bb is exact.\nRecall the definition of the canonical class \u03b5 of an almost complex\nmanifold (M, J). The class \u03b5 is the first Chern class of the subbundle TC\u2032 M of vectors of type (1,0) of the complexified tangent bundle\nTC M. To calculate the canonical class of the almost-K\u00e4hler manifold\n(M, J, \u03c9) take the same affine connection \u2207 on M as that used in the\ns\nconstruction of the star-product \u2217. Denote by R\u0302 = (1/2)Rtkl\ndxk \u2227 dxl\n\n\fALMOST K\u00c4HLER DEFORMATION QUANTIZATION\n\n13\n\nthe curvature matrix of the connection \u2207 and by \u03a0 = (1/2)(Id \u2212 iJ)\nthe projection operator onto the (1,0)-subspace. It follows immediately\nt\nfrom (3.5) that Rtkl\n= 0 (see [15]), i.e., T r R\u0302 = 0. The matrix \u03a0R\u0302\u03a0\nis the curvature matrix of the restriction of the connection \u2207 to TC\u2032 M.\nThe Chern-Weyl form\ns\n\u03b3 = (1/i)T r(\u03a0R\u0302\u03a0) = (1/i)T r(\u03a0R\u0302) = (\u22121/4)Jst Rtkl\ndxk \u2227 dxl\n\nis closed. The canonical class is, by definition, \u03b5 := [\u03b3]. Now it is clear\nfrom (4.13) that\n(4.14)\n\nc0 (\u2217) = [\u03ba] = \u2212(1/2i)\u03b5.\nReferences\n\n[1] F. Bayen, M. Flato, C.
