Chen)\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe sign reversal of the Hall resistivity below the superconducting transition temperature Tc is the\nmost confusing and controversial phenomenon for the last forty years since it was first observed by\nVan Beelen et. el. in 1967 [1]. Experimental data show that the Hall resistivity in many high- Tc and\nconventional type-II superconductors [1-54] exhibits the sign reversal phenomenon, namely, it changes\nits sign from positive to negative, after reaching a minimum, then increases again as the temperature or\napplied magnetic field decreases, when the temperature is slightly below the critical temperature of the\nsuperconductors [1, 36-38]. In some materials, the observed Hall resistivity exhibits the double sign\nreversal, or reentry phenomenon [40, 41]. Various theories [4, 27-29], trying to explain this anomaly,\nhave been proposed, such as, the large thermomagnetic theory [27], flux flow theory [28], opposing\ndrift of quasiparticles theory [29], and many others. However, up to the present time, there is no\nsatisfactory explanation. The origin of this Hall anomaly still remains unsolved.\nRecently, we [6] have developed a self-consistent theory of thermally activated vortex bundle flow\n(TAVBF) over the directional-dependent potential barrier by applying the random walk theorem.\nAccording to this theory it is shown that the origin of the anomalous Hall effect is induced by the\nthermally activated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) over the directional-dependent potential barrier. The\ndirectional-dependent energy barrier means that the energy barrier is a function of the direction of\nthermally activated motion of the vortex bundles. The conditions for appearing of the sign reversal and\ndouble sign reversal of the Hall resistivity for type-II superconductors are derived under the framework\nof present theory. It is shown that the directional-dependent potential barrier of the vortex bundles\nrenormalizes the Hall and longitudinal resistivities strongly. It is also shown that the Hall anomaly is\nuniversal for type-II superconductors, either high- Tc or conventional as well as for bulk materials or\nthin films.\nBased on the present theory, the Hall and longitudinal resistivities as well as Hall angle as functions\nof temperature and applied magnetic field are calculated for type-II superconducting films and bulk\nmaterials. All the results are in agreement with the experiments.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, a mathematical description of the model\nis presented. The theory of anomalous Hall effect is developed in section 3. Within this theory, the\nanomalous Hall effect for type-II superconducting bulk materials is studied in section 4. In section 5,\nthe corresponding Hall anomaly for superconducting films is investigated. In section 6, the reentry\nphenomenon and the conditions for occurring of this fascinating phenomenon are analyzed. Finally,\nseveral important issues about our theory and concluding remarks are presented in sections 7 and 8,\nrespectively.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nMathematical Description of the Model\n\nLet us consider a type-II conventional or high- Tc superconductor, the Hamiltonian of the fluctuation for\nthe flux line lattice (FLL) in the z \u2212 direction is given by [6-12, 23]\n\nH = H f + HR\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H f = H kin + H e represents the Hamiltonian for the free modes [6-12, 23], with H kin the kinetic\nenergy part [6-12, 23]\n\nH kin =\n\n1\n2\u03c1\n\nr\nr\nP ( K ) P\u03bc (\u2212 K )\n\n(2)\n\nr\u2211 \u03bc\nK\u03bc\n\nH e the elastic energy part [6-13, 23],\n\nHe =\n\nr\nr 1\nr\nr\n1\n2\n2\nr\u2211 C L K \u03bc K\u03bd S \u03bc ( K ) S\u03bd (\u2212 K ) +\nr\u2211 (C66 K \u22a5 + C44 K z ) S \u03bc ( K ) S \u03bc (\u2212 K )\n2 K\u03bc\u03bd\n2 K\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nand H R represents the random Hamiltonian, given as [6-12, 23],\n\nHR =\n\nr\u2211\nK\u03bc\n\nr\nr\nf R\u03bc ( K ) S \u03bc (\u2212 K )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere ( \u03bc ,\u03bd ) = ( x, y ) , \u03c1 is the effective mass density of the flux line [14], K \u22a52 = K x2 + K y2 ,\nr\nr\nP\u03bc ( K ), S \u03bc ( K ) are the Fourier transformations of the momentum and displacement operators, and\nr\nCL , C11 , C44 and C66 are temperature- and K -dependent bulk modulus, compression modulus, tilt\nr r\nmodulus and shear modulus, respectively [15-19]. f R (K ) is the Fourier transformation of the\nr r\nr\nr\ncollective pinning force f R (r ) = \u2212\u2207 VR (r ) , with VR (r ) the random potential energy of the collective\npinning [20, 21], which is the sum of the contributions of defects within a distance \u03be of the vortex\nr\ncore position r , where \u03be is the temperature-dependent coherent length. The correlation functions of\nthe random collective pinning force are assumed to be the short-range correlation [7],\n\nr\nr\nr r\n<< f R\u03b1 (k ) f R*\u03b2 (k ' ) >>th = \u03b2 C (T , B) \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4 (k \u2212 k ' )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere << >>th are the quantum, thermal, and random averages, and \u03b2 C (T , B) is the temperatureand magnetic field-dependent correlation strength.\n\n3\n\n\fr\nThe equation of motion of the displacement operator S \u03bc (K ) can be obtained from Eq.

(6) can be obtained as\n\nr\nr\nr\nS \u03bc ( K ) = S R\u03bc ( K ) + S f\u03bc ( K )\n\n(7)\n\nr\nwhere S R\u03bc (K ) denotes the deformation displacement operator of the FLL due to the collective\nr r\nr\npinning of the random function f R\u03bc (K ) , and S f\u03bc (K ) the displacement operator for the fluctuation of\nthe free modes. They are given by\n\nr\nr r r \u03b4\nr\nr r r \u03b4\n1\n1\nS R\u03bc ( K ) = [( K \u22c5 f R ( K )) \u03b1 ,1 ] \u22c5\n+ [ f R\u03b1 ( K ) \u2212 ( K \u22c5 f R ( K )) \u03b1 ,1 ] \u22c5\n2\n2\n2\nK \u22a5 C11 K \u22a5 + C44 K z\nK \u22a5 C66 K \u22a5 + C44 K z2\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\nr\nS f\u03bc ( K ) =\n\nh\n2 \u03c1\u03c9 K\u03bc\n\n(\u03b1 \u2212+Kr\u03bc + \u03b1 Kr\u03bc )\n\n(9)\n\nr\nrespectively, where \u03bc = 1 presents the component parallel to the K \u22a5 direction, while \u03bc = 2 is\nr\nperpendicular to the K \u22a5 direction. It is understood that the free Hamiltonian can be diagonalized with\nthe eigenmodes spectrum [6-12, 23]\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c9 K 1 = [ (C11 K \u22a52 + C44 K z2 )] 2\n\u03c1\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c9 K 2 = [ (C66 K \u22a52 + C44 K z2 )] 2\n\u03c1\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b1 K+r\u03bc , \u03b1 Kr\u03bc are the creation and the annihilation operators for the corresponding eigenmodes.\nHowever, the quenched disorder always destroys the long-range order of the FLL, after which\nonly short-range order, the vortex bundle, prevails [5-7]. The corresponding transverse size of vortex\nr\nbundle | R | is determined by the relation [9, 10]\n\nr r\nr\n<< | S R ( R) \u2212 S R (0) |2 >>th = rf2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere r f represents the random collective pinning force range, once again, <<\nthermal, quantum and random averages.\n\n4\n\n>> th are the\n\n\f3\n\nTheoretical investigation of anomalous Hall effect by random walk\n\ntheorem\nThe theory of anomalous Hall effect is studied based on the self-consistent theory of thermally\nactivated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF), under the steady-state condition, over the directional-dependent\npotential barrier via random walk theorem [6] is developed in this section. The corresponding coherent\noscillation frequency \u03bd c of the vortex bundles and the mean value of the angle between the random\ncollective pinning force of the vortex bundles and positive y -direction are evaluated under the\nconditions J < J c , where J C is the critical current density of the superconductor. Finally, the\ntemperature- and field-dependent Hall and longitudinal resistivities induced by the vortex bundles flow\nare calculated.\n\n3.1\n\nCoherent oscillation frequency and mean direction of random collective pinning force\n\nfor vortex bundles\nr\nIn this subsection let us consider a p-type superconductor, with the applied magnetic field B in the\nr\nr\nr\nz-axis and the external current density J in the x-axis J = J ex with J < J C . The equation of\nmotion of the vortex line inside the vortex bundle driving by the thermal radiation of frequency \u03c9 is\ngiven by\n\nr\nr\nr\nr i\u03c9 t\nr r\nr\nd 2 rv\nM v drv\nM v 2 = q E e + J \u03a6 0 ex \u00d7 ez \u2212 (\n) \u2212 (k R rv ) + f el\n\u03c4 R dt\ndt\n\n(12)\n\nr\nwhere M v is the effective mass of the vortex line, and rv the displacement of vortex line from its\nr\nequilibrium position. In the first term on the right hand side of Eq. (12), Ee i\u03c9 t denotes the driving\nelectric field of the thermal radiation for the vortex line, and q stands for the total circulating charge\nof the vortex line. The second term is the Lorentz force with \u03a6 0 the unit flux. 1 / \u03c4 R characterizes\nthe damping rate associated with the motion of the vortex line, k R represents the restoring force\nr\nconstant of the vortex line under the action of random collective pinning force, and f el is the elastic\nforce of the vortex line inside the vortex bundle. The homogeneous solution of the Eq. (12) vanishes\nquickly due to the presence of damping. The particular solution includes two parts: the time-dependent\nand time-independent parts.\nThe time-dependent part of the particular solution oscillates with frequency \u03c9 about a new\nequilibrium position, which is determined by the time-independent part of the particular solution. By\nidentifying the oscillation energy of the vortex line inside the potential barrier with the thermal energy,\nthe thermal oscillation frequency \u03bd of the individual vortex inside the potential barrier can be\nexpressed as\n\n5\n\n\f\u03bd =\u03bd T\n\n(13)\n\nwith \u03bd = (1 / \u03c0 A) k B / 2M v , where A stands for the random- and thermal-averaged amplitude of the\noscillation of the vortex line in the bundle, and k B the Boltzmann constant.\nHowever, the oscillations of vortex lines inside the vortex bundle are not coherent, namely, their\noscillations are at random. To obtain the coherent oscillation frequency \u03bd c of the vortex bundle as a\nwhole, by utilizing the random walk's theorem, the frequency \u03bd in Eq. (13) must be divided by the\nsquare root of N, the number of vortices inside the vortex bundle\n\n\u03bdc =\n\n\u03bd\nN\n\n=\n\n\u03bd T \u03a60\n\n(14)\n\nR \u03c0B\n\nwhere R is the transverse size of the vortex bundle and B the value of the applied magnetic field.\nThe time-independent part of the particular solution is give by\n\nr\nr\nr \u2212 J \u03a6 0 e y + f el\nrp =\nkR\n\n(15)\n\nr\nThe above result indicates that the vortex line moves to a new equilibrium position rp from its\nr\noriginal one. Since the elastic force f el is much less than the Lorentz force J \u03a6 0 , the angle\n\n\u03b8 between the random collective pinning force and the positive y-direction measured in the\ncounterclockwise sense can be obtained approximately as\n\nr\nr\n| f el | | f el |\n\u03b8\u2245 r =\n| fL | J \u03a60\n\n(16)\n\nr\nr\nwhere | f el | and | f L | are the magnitudes of elastic force and Lorentz force of the vortex line,\nrespectively. Taking into account the fact that the compression modulus C11 is much larger than shear\nr r\nmodulus C66 [7, 8], we arrive at, the magnitude of the displacement vector | S f (r ) | of the vortex\nr\nline as well as its corresponding elastic force | f el | is proportional to\nk B C66 , or\n\n(1\n\nB ) T /(TC \u2212 T ) .\nThe temperature- and field-dependent \u03b8 (T , B) can therefore be written as\n\n\u03b8 (T , B ) = \u03b1\n\n1\n\nB\n\nT\nTc \u2212 T\n\n(17)\n\n6\n\n\fwhere \u03b1 is a proportional constant. By applying the random walk theorem, the mean\nangle \u0398 (T , B) between the random collective pinning force of vortex bundle and positive y-direction\nmeasures in counterclockwise sense, can be expressed as\n\n\u0398 (T , B) = N \u03b8 (T , B ) = \u03b1\n\nT\nTc \u2212 T\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b1 R \u03c0 / \u03a6 0 .\n\n3.2\n\nDirectional-dependent energy barrier\n\nIn this subsection we shall calculate the directional-dependent energy barrier of the vortex bundles\ngenerated by the Magnus force, random collective pinning force, and the strong pinning force inside\nthe vortex bundle. The directional-dependent potential barrier means that the energy barrier is a\nfunction of direction of the thermally activated motion. Assuming that the external current J < J c , and\nr\nr\nis in the x-direction and the applied magnetic field B in the z-direction, the Magnus force FM acting\non the vortex bundle can then be obtained as\n\nr\nr r\nFM = V ns e (vT \u2212 vb ) \u00d7 B e\u02c6z\n\n(19)\n\nr\nwhere vb is the velocity of the thermally activated vortex bundle flow, V is the volume of the\nr\nvortex bundle, e is the electron charge, ns and vT are the supercharge density and its velocity,\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nrespectively, combining with J = ns e vT = J ex , and B = B ez . From the theory of mechanics, the\nr r\npotential generated by a force field F (r ) can be expressed as\n\nr\nr r r\nr\nr\nV (r ) \u2212 V (0) = \u2212 \u222b F (r ) \u22c5 d r\n\n(20)\n\n0\n\nAfter some algebra, the directional-dependent energy barrier of the vortex bundles both in the\npositive and negative x-direction as well as y-direction are obtained as\n\nU + V R ( JB\n\nU \u2212 V R ( JB\n\nvby\nvT\nvby\nvT\n\n\u2212 < Fp x > R )\n\u2212 < Fpx > R )\n\nU + V R ( JB \u2212 JB\n\nvbx\n\u2212 < Fp y > R )\nvT\n\nU \u2212 V R ( JB \u2212 JB\n\nvbx\n\u2212 < Fp y > R )\nvT\n\n(21)\n\nrespectively, where U is the potential barrier generated by the strong pinning force due to the\nrandomly distributed strong pinning sites inside the vortex bundle, R represents the transverse size of\n7\n\n\fr\nthe vortex bundle, the range of U is assumed to be of the order R , and < Fp > R stands for the\nrandom average of the random collective pinning force per unit volume.\n\n3.3\n\nVortex bundle flow velocity and its induced longitudinal and Hall resistivities\n\nThe results of Eq. (21) indicate that the directional-dependent potential barrier used for calculating the\nvortex bundle flow velocity actually itself contains the vortex bundle flow velocity. Therefore, the\nvelocity of thermally activated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) over the directional-dependent energy\nbarrier must be solved self-consistently as follows\n\nvby = \u03bd c R {exp [\n\u2212 exp [\n\n\u22121\nv\n( U \u2212 V R ( J B \u2212 J B bx \u2212 < Fp y > R ))]}\nk BT\nvT\n\nvbx = \u03bd c R {exp [\n\u2212 exp [\n\n\u22121\nv\n( U + V R ( J B \u2212 J B bx \u2212 < Fp y > R ))]\nk BT\nvT\n(22)\n\nvby\n\u22121\n(U + V R ( J B\n\u2212 < Fpx > R ))]\nk BT\nvT\n\nvby\n\u22121\n(U \u2212 V R ( J B\n\u2212 < Fpx > R )) ]}\nk BT\nvT\n\n(23)\n\nwith \u03bd c is the coherent oscillation frequency of the vortex bundle. Taking into account the fact that\n\n(vbx / vT ) << 1 , from the above equations, the vortex bundle flow velocity in the y and x components can\nbe approximately obtained as\n\n\u03bd\n\nvby = (\n\nR\n\nT \u03a60\n\u2212U\n\u2212V R\n) R exp (\n){exp [\n( J B \u2212 |< Fp > R | cos \u0398)]\n\u03c0 B\nk BT\nk BT\n\n\u2212 exp [\n\n+V R\n( J B \u2212 |< Fp > R | cos \u0398)]}\nk BT\n\n(24)\n\nT \u03a60\n\u2212U\n\u2212 V R \u2212 J B | vby |\n) R exp (\n) {exp [\n(\n+ |< Fp > R | sin \u0398)]\nR \u03c0B\nk BT\nk BT\nvT\n\n\u03bd\n\nvbx = (\n\n\u2212 exp [\n\n+ V R \u2212 J B | vby |\n(\n+ |< Fp > R | sin \u0398)]}\nk BT\nvT\n\n(25)\n\nrespectively, where \u0398 (T , B) is the mean angle between the random collective pinning force of the\nvortex bundles and positive y -direction measured in the counterclockwise sense. By considering the\nr\nr r\nidentities E = \u2212vb \u00d7 B , \u03c1 xx = E x / J , \u03c1 xy = E y / J , together with Eq. (18) and bearing in mind that\n\u0398 (T , B) is usually very small, then the longitudinal and Hall resistivities induced by the vortex bundle\nflow can now be obtained, respectively, as follows:\n8\n\n\f\u03c1 xx =\n\n\u03bd B T \u03a60\nJ \u03c0\n\n1\n\nexp(\n\n\u2212U\nVR\n\u03b2 C (T , B) 2\n){exp [\n( JB \u2212 (\n) )]\nk BT\nk BT\nV\n1\n\n\u2212 exp [\n\n\u03c1 xy =\n\n\u2212\u03bd\n\n\u2212V R\n\u03b2 C (T , B ) 2\n(J B \u2212 (\n) )]}\nkB T\nV\n\nB T \u03a60\nJ \u03c0\n\n\u2212 exp [\n\nexp(\n\n(26)\n\n1\n| vby |\n\u2212U\nV R \u03b2 C (T , B ) 2\nT\n){exp [\n((\n) \u03b1\n)]\n\u2212 JB\nk BT\nk BT\nV\nTC \u2212 T\nvT\n\n1\n| vby |\n\u2212 V R \u03b2 C (T , B ) 2\nT\n((\n) \u03b1\n)]}\n\u2212 JB\nk BT\nV\nTC \u2212 T\nvT\n\n(27)\n\nand\n\n| vby |= J\u03c1 xx / B\n\n(28)\n\nwith ( \u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2 is the magnitude of the random average of the random collective pinning force\nper unit volume, and \u03b1 is a proportional constant. The results of Eqs. (26) and (27) demonstrate that\nthe directional-dependent potential barrier of the vortex bundle renormalizes the Hall and longitudinal\nresistivities strongly. It is well understood that when temperature (applied magnetic field) below\n\nT1 ( B1 ) , the quasiorder-disorder first-order phase transition temperature (magnetic field) [7, 8, 11, 12],\nthe vortex lines form large vortex bundles of dimension R \u2248 10 \u22126 m ; while temperature (applied\nmagnetic field) above T1 ( B1 ) , the vortex lines form a disordered amorphous vortex system , however,\nthey are not randomly distributed single-quantized vortex lines. In other words, the vortex lines still\nbounded together to form small vortex bundles of dimension R \u2248 10 \u22128 m [11, 12]. Therefore, taking\ninto account the fact that the arguments in the exponential functions inside the curly bracket of Eqs. (26)\nand (27) are very small when the Lorentz force is close to the random collective pinning force, we\nfinally obtain the temperature- and field- dependent longitudinal resistivity \u03c1 xx , Hall resistivity \u03c1 xy\nand Hall angle \u03b8 H as\n\n\u03c1 xx =\n\n\u03c1 xy =\n\n1\n\n\u03bd B \u03a60\n\nexp (\n\nJ \u03c0T\n\n\u2212\u03bd B \u03a6 0\nJ \u03c0T\n\n\u03b8 H = tan \u22121 (\n\n\u03c1 xy\n\u03c1 xx\n\n\u2212U\n2V R\n\u03b2 C (T , B) 2\n) (\n) [J B \u2212 (\n) )]\nk BT\nkB\nV\n\n(29)\n\n1\n| vby |\n\u03b2 C (T , B) 2\n\u2212 U 2V R\nT\n)(\n) [(\n) \u03b1\n\u2212J B\n]\nk BT\nkB\nV\nTC \u2212 T\nvT\n\n(30)\n\nexp (\n\n1\n)2\n\n\u03b1\n\nJ B \u2212 ( \u03b2 (T , B) / V\n\n1\n)2\n\nC\n\n) = tan \u22121 [\n\nJ B ( | vby | / vT ) \u2212 ( \u03b2 (T , B) / V\nC\n\n9\n\nT /(TC \u2212 T )\n\n]\n\n(31)\n\n\frespectively, with | vby |= J\u03c1 xx / B . The above results give rise to the anomalous Hall effect. The\nconditions for the appearance of anomalous Hall effect can be derived as follows: Let us assume that\nthe vortex system is initially in the region of thermally activated motion of small vortex bundles. From\nour previous study [6], the value of (1 / B) ( \u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2 increases with decreasing applied\nmagnetic field when the temperature T of the system is kept at a constant value; if this value is greater\nthan the value of (| vby | / vT ) /(\u03b1 T /(TC \u2212 T ) ) , then the Hall resistivity \u03c1 xy in Eq. (30) changes its sign\nfrom positive to negative with decreasing applied magnetic field. On the other hand, the value of\n\n(1 / B) ( \u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2 increases and that of \u03b1 T /(TC \u2212 T ) decreases as temperature decreasing\nwhen the applied magnetic field\n\nB is kept at a constant value. Therefore, the term\n\n(1 / B) ( \u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2 \u03b1 T /(TC \u2212 T ) exists a maximum at some temperature T if this maximum is\ngreater than J (| vby | / vT ) , then \u03c1 xy possesses the sign reversal property. According to the above\nanalysis, the condition for appearing the Hall anomaly is\n\n1\n\n| vby |\n1 \u03b2 C (T , B) 2\nT\n(\n) \u03b1\n>J\nB\nV\nTc \u2212 T\nvT\n\n(32)\n\nThe present results demonstrate that the anomalous Hall effect is induced by the thermally\nactivated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) over the directional-dependent energy barrier. Moreover, \u03c1 xy\nmight possibly possess the double sign reversal property or reentry phenomenon at temperature T = TR ,\nthe reentry temperature. In other words, \u03c1 xy initially decreases, crossing over from positive to\nnegative, after reaching a minimum, then increases again crossing over back from negative to positive\nat T = TR . This fascinating phenomenon of reentry will be presented in detail in Section 6.\nNext let us investigate the behavior of longitudinal resistivity \u03c1 xx as functions of temperature\nand applied magnetic field. As we have mentioned above, the value of\n\n(1 / B) ( \u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2\n\nincreases with decreasing temperature (applied magnetic field); therefore, \u03c1 xx in Eq. (29) decreases\nmonotonically as temperature (applied magnetic field) decreasing. The first-order phase transition\nbetween the small and large vortex bundles of the vortex system takes place [7, 8] when\ntemperature (applied magnetic field) below T1 ( B1 ) , the vortex system then crosses over to the large\nvortex bundles. In this case, the potential barrier U generated by the strong pinning force due to the\nrandomly distributed strong pinning sites inside the vortex bundle will become large; in other words,\nboth of the Hall and longitudinal resistivities will decay to zero quickly with decreasing temperature\n(applied magnetic field).\nIt is worthwhile to point out that all the above derivations are valid for type-II conventional and\nhigh- Tc superconductors. Although their mechanisms [30-35] and the method of pairing are different,\n\n10\n\n\fthese only affect the structure of the vortex lattice and is a minute effect in our theory. It is also\ninteresting to note that dimensional fluctuations only have an effect on the volume of short-range order,\nand do not affect the essential structure of our theory. Therefore, the above formalisms are valid both\nfor superconducting bulk materials and thin films. Within the framework of present theory, it is\ndemonstrated that the Hall anomaly is universal for type-II conventional and high- Tc as well as for bulk\nmaterials and thin films superconductors provided certain conditions are satisfied. Detailed calculations\nand discussions will be presented in subsequent sections.\n\n4\n\nAnomalous Hall effect for type-II superconducting bulk materials\n\nIn this section first let us concentrate on the case for type-II superconducting bulk materials. The\nvolume V for the vortex bundle in Eqs. (29) and (30) is given as V = \u03c0 R 2 L , where R and L are\nthe transverse and longitudinal sizes of the vortex bundle, respectively. In this case, the longitudinal\nand Hall resistivities for type-II superconducting bulk materials now become\n\n\u03c1 xx =\n\n\u03c1 xy =\n\n\u03bd \u03a60 B\nJ \u03c0 T\n\n1\n\nexp (\n\n\u2212\u03bd \u03a6 0 B\nJ \u03c0 T\n\n\u2212 U 2\u03c0 R 3 L\n\u03b2 C (T , B) 2\n)[\n][ J B \u2212 (\n) ]\nk BT\nkB\nV\n\nexp (\n\n1\n| vby |\n\u03b2 C (T , B) 2\n\u2212 U 2\u03c0 R 3 L\nT\n\u2212J B\n)[\n] [(\n) \u03b1\n]\nk BT\nkB\nTc \u2212 T\nvT\nV\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nrespectively, with | vby |= J\u03c1 xx / B . The Eq. (34) indicates that the value of Hall resistivity \u03c1 xy changes\nits sign from positive to negative with decreasing applied magnetic field (temperature) if the condition\nfor appearing Hall anomaly given by Eq. (32) (1 / B)(\u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2 \u03b1 T /(Tc \u2212 T ) > J (| vby | / vT ) is\nsatisfied. The situations for constant temperature and constant applied magnetic field of this Hall\nanomaly are investigated separately as follows.\n4.1\n\nHall anomaly for constant temperature\n\nUnder the framework of present theory, the Hall resistivity \u03c1 xy in Eq. (34) does change its sign from\npositive to negative as the applied magnetic field decreasing when the temperature of the system is kept\nat a constant value T . The numerical calculation results of \u03c1 xy and \u03c1 xx of Eqs. (33) and (34) when\nthe temperature is kept at T = 91K , with B the applied magnetic field in Tesla are given as follows:\n\u03c1 xy ( B = 3.5) = 1.2914 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m , \u03c1 xy (3.03) = 1.7658 \u00d7 10\u221215 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xy (2) = \u22122.7907 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xy (1.5) = \u22123.9996 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n11\n\n\u03c1 xy (2.5) = \u22121.4627 \u00d710\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\u03c1 xy (1) = \u22124.6405 \u00d710\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\f\u03c1 xy (0.75) = \u22123.9801\u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m , \u03c1 xy (0.5) = \u22122.0098 \u00d7 10 \u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ; \u03c1 xx (3.5) = 1.8739 \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\u03c1 xx (3.03) = 1.5916 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u03a9 \u2212 m , \u03c1 xx (2.5) = 1.2663 \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (2) = 9.5142 \u00d7 10 \u22127 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (1.5) = 6.2539 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (0.75) = 1.6825 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (1) = 2.9669 \u00d710\u22127 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (0.5) = 1.226 \u00d7 10 \u22127 \u03a9 \u2212 m .\nThe above results show that \u03c1 xy decreases initially, crossing over from positive to negative near\n3.03 Tesla, after reaching a minimum at 1 Tesla, then increases again, while \u03c1 xx decreases\nmonotonically as the applied magnetic field decreasing. As we have mentioned in the last section, the\nfirst-order phase transition between the small and large vortex bundles of the vortex system occurs [7, 8]\nwhen the applied magnetic field decreases below the first-order phase transition magnetic field\n\nB1 = 0.5 Tesla. In this case, the vortex system crosses over from small vortex bundles to large vortex\nbundles, the potential barrier U produced by the randomly distributed strong pinning sites inside the\nvortex bundle becomes large; hence, both of the Hall and longitudinal resistivities induced by the\nvortex bundles flow approach to zero quickly with decreasing applied magnetic field. These results are\nin agreement with the experimental data on YBa2Cu3O7 \u2212\u03b4 high- Tc bulk materials [36].

As we have noted in last section, the first-order phase\ntransition between the small and large vortex bundles of the vortex system takes place [7, 8] when the\ntemperature decreases below the first-order phase transition temperature T1 = 88K between the small\nand large vortex bundles.

Taking into account the fact\nthat TR increases with increasing ( \u03b2 C (T , B) / V )1 / 2 , the random collective pinning force per unit\nvolume of the vortex system [39]. Therefore, the reentry phenomenon could be observed for materials\nwith larger random collective pinning force, such as, YBa2 Cu 3O7 \u2212\u03b4 [40] or Tl 2 Ba 2 Cu 2 O8\n[41].\nThe numerical calculations of Hall resistivity \u03c1 xy and longitudinal resistivity \u03c1 xx induced by\nthe thermally activated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) as functions of temperature for small vortex\nbundles when the applied magnetic field is kept at a constant value B = 2 Tesla are given as follows:\n\u03c1 xy (T = 102 K ) = 2.1346 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03a9 \u2212 m , \u03c1 xy (100) = \u22123.69 \u00d7 10\u221219 \u03a9 \u2212 m , \u03c1 xy (98) = \u22121.4067 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\u03c1 xy (96) = \u22122.3518 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\u03c1 xy (84) = 5.46 \u00d7 10\u221212 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xy (92) = \u22121.03436 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03a9 \u2212 m , \u03c1 xy (88) = 5.9409 \u00d7 10\u221219 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\u03c1 xy (78) = 1.3011\u00d7 10\u221211 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xy (76) = 1.2967 \u00d710 \u221211 \u03a9 \u2212 m ;\n\n\u03c1 xx (102) = 1.6728 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (100) = 1.0657 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (98) = 7.4819 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (96) = 5.4754 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (92) = 5.16087 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (88) = 5.1382 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (84) = 4.951 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (78) = 4.8488 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m ,\n\n\u03c1 xx (76) = 4.65 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03a9 \u2212 m .\n\nIt is shown that, for constant applied magnetic field B = 2 Tesla, \u03c1 xy decreases initially,\ncrossing over from positive to negative near 100 K, after reaching a minimum at 96 K, then increases\ncrossing over back from negative to positive near 88K , reaching a local maximum at about 78K, then\ndecreases again, while \u03c1 xx decreases monotonically as decreasing the temperature.

After the theoretical woks of Ginzburg, Landau [52], Abrikosov [2] and Gor'kov [53], the flux\nline in the mixed state type-II superconductors form a long-range order of the vortex line lattice.\nHowever, the existing theories in the literature on vortex dynamics are classical where the kinetic\nenergy term in the Hamiltonian is omitted. Recently, we [6-12, 23] have developed a quantum theory\nfor the vortex dynamics with full Hamiltonian including the kinetic energy, elastic energy and random\nenergy. The presence of random energy due to quenched disorder, the long-range order of the FLL is\ndestroyed, only the short-range order prevails [6-12, 23]. By applying the random walk theorem, we\narrive at the theory of thermally activated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) over the directional-dependent\n\n17\n\n\fpotential barrier occurs for certain ranges of temperature and applied magnetic filed for J < J c .\nTherefore, the present theory for the anomalous Hall effect is indeed a microscopic theory.\nThirdly, we only consider the systems that are in steady state, any time-dependent behavior of the\nsystem will not be discussed.\nFourthly, our theory is a very general one. It can be applied to type-II conventional and\nhigh- Tc superconductors. Although their mechanisms, the structure of vortex lattice, and even the\nmethod of pairing are entirely different, these do not affect the results of our theory.\nFinally, the dimensional fluctuations do not affect the essential structure of our theory. Therefore\nwe could investigate 2D and 3D anomalous Hall effects at the same time.\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, a microscopic theory of anomalous Hall effect in type-II conventional and high- Tc\nsuperconductors via random walk theorem is developed. Based on the present theory, it is shown that\nthe Hall anomaly is induced by the thermally activated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) over the\ndirectional-dependent potential barrier formed by Magnus force, random collective pinning force, and\nstrong pinning force inside the vortex bundles. The conditions for the sign reversal and double sign\nreversal of the Hall resistivity are obtained. It is shown that the Hall anomaly is universal for type-II\nsuperconductors, either conventional or high- Tc as well as for bulk materials and thin films, provided\ncertain given conditions are satisfied. It is also demonstrated that the directional-dependent potential\nbarrier of the vortex bundles renormalizes the Hall and longitudinal resistivities strongly. The Hall and\nlongitudinal resistivities are calculated for type-II superconducting bulk materials as well as thin films\nas functions of temperature and applied magnetic field. It is shown that they indeed exhibit the\nanomalous properties, namely, \u03c1 xy decreases initially, crossing over from positive to negative, after\nreaching a minimum, then increases and approaches to zero, while \u03c1 xx decreases monotonically with\ndecreasing the temperature (applied magnetic field). Finally, the reentry phenomenon is discussed,\nnamely, for some materials when the applied magnetic field is kept at a constant value, the Hall\nresistivity \u03c1 xy decreases initially, crossing over from positive to negative, after reaching a\nminimum, then increases crossing over back from negative to positive, after reaching a\nlocal maximum, then decreases again as decreasing the temperature. All the results are in agreement\nwith the experiments.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Professor E H Brandt for useful and constructive discussions.\n\n18\n\n\fReferences\n[1] H.
