Introduction\nSpectra are windows through which we access the physics and the chemistry of substellar atmospheres down into the planetary regime. Consequently, model atmospheres are\nneeded to produce synthetic spectra. The complexity of such simulations necessitates the\nuse of approximations and/or analytic simplifications to make them numerically feasible.\nThe input data needed can be frequently incomplete or of limited accuracy, translating\ninto uncertainties in the model results. The formation of clouds in their atmospheres is\none of the most fundamental challenges in studies of planets and brown dwarfs. Element\ndepletion and gravitational settling are only two feedback mechanisms arising. We therefore have set out to compare our approaches of cloud formation in substellar atmosphere\nsimulations to achieve more transparency in evaluating the uncertainty inherent to theoretical modelling. We show in how far model results for characteristic dust quantities\nvary due to different assumptions. We also demonstrate differences in the spectral energy\ndistributions resulting from our individual cloud modelling in 1D substellar atmosphere\nsimulations.\n119\n\n\f120\n\nChristiane Helling\n\nFigure 1.

Cloud models & Test cases\nTheoretical models of substellar atmosphere aim to describe the existence of clouds\nmade of small particles and their influence on the atmosphere's energy budget. Basically\ntwo model philosophies are followed: The cloud particles hoover inside the atmosphere\n(Tsuji 2005) or, the particles gravitationally settle, hence disappear from the atmosphere\nbut need to re-form (Ackerman & Marley 2001; Sudarsky et al. 2003, Woitke & Helling\n2004, Allard et al. (2007). All models aim to produce as accurate as possible synthetic\n\n\fIAU 249: Comparison of cloud models\n\n121\n\nspectra by modelling cloud characteristics like the number of dust particles, the material composition of the cloud grains/droplets, material composition, and the size of the\nindividual cloud particles. In general, formation of clouds by condensation would be controlled by kinetic factors, for example induced by turbulence, and amorphous solids would\nform. Given sufficient time and energy, these amorphous solids will crystallise and form\nequilibrium solids known as minerals. Phase-equilibrium is adopted in the approaches of\nMarley & Ackerman (2001), Tsuji (2005), Allard et al. (2007), and the kinetic approach\nis taken by Woitke & Helling (2004) and Helling et al. (2007).\nThe dust cloud models involved in the test calculations are summarised (and simplified)\nas follows:\nFixed grain size\nTime scale comparison\n(Tsuji 2005)\n(Allard et al. 2007)\n\u2013 grain size a = const\n\u03c4mix = \u03c4sed (a) \u21d2 (T, p, a)\n\u2013 between Tcond and Tcr\n\u03c4gr (T, p, a) < \u03c4mix \u21d2 \u03c4mix = \u03c4gr (a)\n\u03c4gr (T, p, a) > \u03c4mix \u21d2 \u03c4mix = \u03c4cond (a)\nDiffusive transport\n(Marley & Ackerman 2001;\nMarley et al. 2007)\n\u2013 diffusive transport of homog. dust\n\u2013 needs dust formation parameters.\n\nTop - Down approach\n(Woitke & Helling 2004,\nHelling, Woitke, Thi 2007)\n\u2013 conserv. equation for dirty dust format.\n+ convective over-shooting\n\nWe designed test cases to study difference arising from our different theoretical approach\nto model clouds in substellar atmosphere simulations. We disentangle our individual\ncloud models from the complete atmosphere problem (Test case 1) in order to exclude\npossible feedback amplifications in the entire model atmosphere codes. Only as a second\nstep, we investigate possible differences in the spectral appearance of a given substellar\nobject (Test case 2). The test cases are designed as follows and more details can be\nfound under http://phoenix.hs.uni-hamburg.de/BrownDwarfsToPlanets1/:\nTest case 1:\nTest case 2:\n\u2013 compare results from\n\u2013 compare results from\ncloud models only\ncomplete 1D atmosphere simulation\n\u2013 local quantities given :\n\u2013 global quantities given:\n(T, p ,vconv ) structure\nTeff = 1800K, log g = 5.\n\u2013 different dust cloud treatment\n\u2013 different model atmosphere codes\nincluding different dust cloud treatment\n\n3. Results\nWe perform our tests for brown dwarfs of spectral class L and T. Figure 1 shows the\ndust content (dust-to-gas ratio \u03c1d /\u03c1g ) of the clouds calculated by different model approaches (Sect. 2). We observe similarities amongst the different cloud model results like\nthe location of the inner cloud edge and the approximate location of the maximum dust\ncontent inside the cloud. However, differences are apparent like e.g. the pressure range\ncovered by the clouds. We find the same behaviour for other opacity relevant cloud quantities like grain size and cloud material composition. It is therefore not surprising that\nthe resulting spectra (Fig. 2) show a very similar general behaviour, like the absolute flux\nlevel, but vary in details. Figure 2 also demonstrates that the model atmosphere simulations for Teff = 1800K, log g = 5.0, [M/H]=0.0 fall into two groups: those producing a\nthin cloud layer (Tsuji with Tcrit =1900K, Homeier & Allard) and those producing a thick\ncloud layer (Tsuji with Tcrit =1700K, Marley & Ackerman, Dehn/Helling&Woitke (Dehn\n\n\f122\n\nChristiane Helling\n\nFigure 2. Results for Test case 2 (L dwarf): Spectral energy distribution between 0.5\u20133.0\u03bcm\nfrom different atmosphere codes utilising different cloud-model approaches for (Teff = 1800K,\nlog g = 5.0, [M/H]=0.0). Note, that the two Tsuji-cases demonstrate the influence of the cloud\nthickness: Tcrit =1700K (brown) \u2013 thick cloud, Tcrit =1900K (orange) \u2013 thin cloud.\n\n2007)). It is interesting to realise that two entirely different mechanisms are responsible\nto move from one group to the other: Tsuji varies the geometrical cloud thickness by\nusing a critical temperature Tcrit for a constant grain size which results in an optically\nthinner/thicker cloud. The cloud models employed by Homeier & Allard, Marley & Ackerman, Dehn/Helling&Woitke produce different amounts of dust (Fig. 1) and different\ngrain size distributions across the cloud height causing an optically thiner/thicker cloud\n(not shown).\n\n4. Conclusion\nOur test case studies show that the results of our individual cloud models are comparable regarding general feature like the location of cloud base and the maximum dust-to-gas\nratio. However, the cloud-model results differ if studied in more detail. It is therefore no\nsurprise that the spectral energy distributions produced from our different 1D atmosphere simulations for a given parameter combination (Teff , logg, [M/H]) differ in almost\nthe entire wavelength range. It remains to quantify these differences in order to provide a\ngeneral range of applicability for e.g. stellar parameter determinations inside and beyond\nthe substellar regime.\nAcknowledgement:\n\nWe thank all the participants of the workshop From Brown Dwarfs to Planets: Chemistry\nand Cloud formation which was supported by the Lorentz Center of the University Leiden,\nNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, The Netherlands research\nSchool for Astronomy, the Scottish University Physics Alliance, and European Space\nAgency.
