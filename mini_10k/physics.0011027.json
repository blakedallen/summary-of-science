In this work we begin the development of the\ntheoretical background to account for these results and fully understand the phenomena\ninvolved. This information will then be used to define and carry out new experiments\nto evaluate the feasibility of using the phase from reflected GPS signals for altimetric\npurposes and the advantages of using interferometric combinations of the signals at different\nfrequencies-the PIP concept.\nWe focus on the coherence properties of the signals, including the PIP interferometric\ncombination of phases in the different frequencies. In this work we will concentrate on a\nstatic, 8 m high receiver (at least in regards to the simulations), and an infinitely removed\nstatic source. As the ocean moves, the received field will pick up a random phase. We\nwant to understand the behavior of this phase, as the goal is to carry out altimetric measurements using phase ranging. We will also keep in mind that this random phase carries\ngeophysical information (intuitively, the bigger the significant wave height, the larger the\nphase excursions).\nOur simulations are based on the Fresnel integral and use simulated Gaussian oceans\nusing the Elfouhaily et al. spectrum. The simulation tool, FRESNEL, is capable of generating time series of the reflected field at different frequencies, and then analyzing their\nproperties. This software is written in IDL.\nThe most important point we need to answer is whether the signal can be tracked in the\naforementioned situations. As we show, the PIP combination of the signals helps clean the\nsignal from noise-the more correlated the signals at different frequencies the more effective\nis the PIP mechanism. The following questions are specifically addressed:\n\u2022 What is the reflected field spectrum? This is determined by the orbital ocean motion,\nfor a static receiver. We also discuss the moving case and show that it depends on\nthe system gain.\n\u2022 Does the winding number accumulate, or does it average to zero? Winding number\nrefers to phase accumulation. Large phase excursions (many cycles) are seen in our\nsimulations. Our simulations show, however, that there isn't a preferred direction for\nphase winding. This means that altimetric phase measurements can be accurate.\n\u2022 What are the theoretical values for the average values of the interferometric fields?\nHow do the fields correlate across frequencies? We show that the most important\n4\n\n\ffactor is the relation between significant wave height and the (real or synthetic) electromagnetic wavelength.\n\u2022 What is the coherence time of the signals (the reflected phase)? We show it is longest\nfor the PIP combination. For rough seas, the correlation between the fields (and\ntherefore interferometric coherence) in different frequencies disappears, and the coherence time goes to zero even for the interferometric combinations. In calmer ocean\nconditions, however, our results indicate that the interferometric combination remains\ncoherent while the individual signals lose coherence rapidly.\n\u2022 What is the structure function of the reflected phase? We see a good fit with a random\nwalk model, with a drift rate proportional to wind speed.\n\u2022 In what ways is the PIP interferometric signal different and, presumably, superior to\nthe original ones? Coherence, a basic element for altimetric purposes.\nFinally, we discuss the robustness of altimetric phase measurements after low-pass filtering the PIP combination. We show that low-pass filtered PIP data can provide more\nrobust and accurate altimetric measurements to detect slow-varying geophysical signals in\nthe ocean.\n\n5\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nIntroduction\nThis is the sum of Technical Notes PIPAER-IEEC-TN-1100 and PIPAER-IEEC-TN-2100,\nTheoretical Feasibility Analysis.

Prepare this technical note\nIn addition we analyze some issues relating to the architecture of the proposed PIP\ninstrument.\n\n6\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nState-of-the-Art, Review\n3.1\n\nHistorical overview\n\nThe PIP idea can be traced back to the PARIS concept [Mart\u0131\u0301n-Neira, 1993], where the\nuse of GNSS signals as sources of opportunity for bistatic altimetry was first proposed.\nThe goal of the present research is to assess the possibilities of using the phase information\nof the reflected signal from a PARIS GNSS system for altimetric purposes. In particular,\nwe will study the merits of using the phase from a dual frequency GNSS system in an\ninterferometric fashion. Other uses of reflected phase data can also be envisioned (surely\nthe temporal behavior of phase fluctuations and other characteristics contain geophysical\ninformation about the sea surface) but we will not explicitly investigate this possibility in\nwhat follows. Rather, we will, for now, content ourselves with providing the background\nfor discussion of these ideas in future work. This is a natural byproduct of our interest in\nphase altimetry, as we will see.\nThat the GPS signal reflected from the ocean surface can retain coherence under some\nconditions has been demonstrated in the past. In [Auber et al., 1994] we have the first\nreport of a GPS receiver \"locking\" onto a sea-reflected signal. Motivated by this somewhat\nsurprising event, tracking of reflected signals was later seeked and achieved for extended\nperiods of time in a series of experiments with flights (over the Chesapeake Bay and the\nEastern Shore of Virginia) at an altitude of up to 5500 m [Garrison et al., 1996]. This\nwas accomplished using an Ashtech Z-12 off-the-shelf receiver with a LHCP nadir looking\nantenna, and it was observed that carrier lock was obtained. This particular receiver would\nnot have been able to track otherwise.\nOn the other hand, several groups have to date successfully analyzed reflected data\nin order to correlate the direct and reflected signals with clean code replicas. In the experiment carried out by ESA in September 1997 two receivers were employed, operating\nindependently of each other, one tracking the direct signal with an up-looking antenna, the\nother recovering the reflected signal via a down-looking LHCP 9 dB helical antenna over an\n18 m bridge near Rotterdam (The Netherlands), the \"Zeeland Brug\". After amplification,\neach of the signals was sent to a different GPS receiver (GEC Plessey builder kit 2). The\nreceivers down-converted the signals to IF (4.309 MHz, with a bandwidth of 1.9 MHz).\nThe IF signals were sent directly to a high-performance sampling card, which sampled the\ndata at 6.25 MHz with 2 MHz bandwidth. They were then cross-correlated with replicas of\nthe signal adjusted for Doppler due to satellite motion and with 20 ms duration (20 C/A\ncode periods). Using the correlation delay data from the direct and reflected signal, this\n\n7\n\n\fgroup solved for the height of the bridge over mean surface (which depended on the tide)\nas well as a hardware bias constant via a least squares fitting procedure. In addition, the\nreceivers recorded standard RINEX files, including SNR. The GPS signals were deemed\nusable if the SNR of the reflected signal was greater than 6 to 9 dB, and if the geometry was favorable (visibility and multi-path were rather complicated in some geometrical\nconfigurations, which were then excluded). Significant Wave Height during the experiment\nwas around 1.4 meters (equivalent to a height standard deviation \u03c3\u03b6 of about 35 cm), and\nthe altimetric performance was rather poor, as only the C/A code could be used for correlation (in general, a 1% of the chip length is assumed to be the optimal precision for one\nmeasurement-this is 3 m for C/A code). A very good description and further details can\nbe found in [Caparrini, 1998].\nThe IEEC Earth Sciences Department has been able to reproduce the analysis of the\nBridge Experiment data with similar results. The analysis tools for the generation of the\nGPS signals and their correlation with the received ones have been developed in Matlab.\nAnother aspect of the Bridge Experiment analysis carried out by ESA was the attempt\nto extract phase information from the data. The first attempt of phase processing was an\nevaluation of Doppler frequency based on zero-crossings counting [Caparrini, 1998]. The\napproach was to first multiply the signal by an appropriate clear replica of the PRN code\nof a satellite in view. It was then expected that a peak in the Fourier transform of the\nresulting signal would appear at the IF plus the Doppler frequency. The direct approach\nwas not deemed feasible, however, due to the limited length of the signals (only 10 ms long),\nwhich did not allow for enough spectral resolution. The signal multiplied by the replica was\ninstead first filtered with a rather narrow filter in order to eliminate all but the expected\nDoppler-shifted component. After that, frequency was estimated using the zero-crossings\ncount for each 10 ms stream of data, with rather good results for both the direct and the\nreflected signal. This suggested that the reflected signal still contained a certain degree of\ncoherence. A second study was then devoted to the measurement of the relative tide height\n(that is, the difference in the height measurements at different times through the difference\nin the number of zero-crossings between the direct and the reflected signals). The reasoning\nwas that if the phase could be measured at all, it would be only up to a phase bias. If the\nbias is assumed to be constant over some short measurement times, then the change in the\nphase between those times would be related directly to the change in delay between the\ndirect and the reflected signals. This calculation, however, could not be carried through\nbecause the data was too noisy and the intervals between data measurements too far apart\nin time.\n\n3.2\n\nThe goal of this research\n\nAs we have seen, several experimental results show that it is possible to extract useful phase\ninformation from reflected signals. In the analysis sketched below we will begin to develop\nthe theoretical background to account for these results. The goal of this work is to continue\nthis development and analysis of past work to fully understand the phenomena involved.\nThis information will then be used to define and carry out new experiments to evaluate the\nfeasibility of using the phase from reflected GPS signals for altimetric purposes.\nWe will focus on the coherence of the signals, including the interferometric combination\nof phases in the different frequencies. In this work we will concentrate on a static, 8 m high\nreceiver (at least in regards to the simulations), and an infinitely removed static source. As\n\n8\n\n\fthe ocean moves, the received field will pick up a random phase. We want to understand\nthe behavior of this phase, as the goal is to carry out altimetric measurements using phase\nranging. We will also keep in mind that this random phase carries geophysical information\n(intuitively, the bigger the significant wave height, the larger the phase excursions).\nThe PIP concept concept consists in combining two phases from the signals at different\nfrequencies. Imagine a very smooth and slowly changing ocean. By combining the two\nphases we obtain a slowly changing interferometric phase. In some sense we would expect\nthat this interferometric phase will be less sensitive to small ripples in the ocean and thus\nprovide a more robust ranging tool for altimetry.\nSeveral implementations of this concept can be envisioned: a static receiver on a coast or\nbridge to monitor tides or floods as well as sea state. Or deployment on boats, aircraft and\nspacecraft for global altimetric or oceanographic measurements. Carrier altimetric signals\nover the oceans, even when seen by a fast moving Low Earth Orbiter, will mostly be low\nfrequency. A strong topographic signal over the oceans would be a slope of 1 meter every\n100 km. As seen by the LEO (traveling at 7 km/s, say), this translates into 0.35 Hz in L1,\na rise of 5 cycles in 100/7 seconds. In L25, this becomes 0.01 Hz.\nOn the other hand, the roughness and motion of the sea will induce high frequency\n\"jitter\" on the received signal. This is a nuisance for altimetry, and this is where we expect\nthe PIP concept to bring added value, as the interferometric combination should be less\nsensitive to these effects. It is appropriate to recall here the old ado, \"What is noise to\nsome is signal to others.\" This jitter may contain very useful information.\nIn the author's mind, the most important point we need to answer is whether the signal\ncan be tracked in the aforementioned situations. As we will see, the PIP concept will help\nclean the signal from noise. For the most part, we will focus in this work on the low altitude,\nstatic receiver situation. The moving cases at higher altitudes will be left for future work,\nas we will discuss in the last Chapter.\nIn this report we will address, among others, the following questions:\n1. What is the reflected field spectrum?\n2. Does the winding number (to be described below) accumulate, or does it average to\nzero?\n3. What are the theoretical values for the average values of the interferometric fields?\nThat is, how do the fields correlate across frequencies?\n4. What is the coherence time of the signals (the reflected phase)?\n5. What is the structure function of the reflected phase?\n6. In what ways is the interferometric signal different and, presumably, superior to the\noriginal ones?\n\n9\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nBackground and Applicable\nModels\nThe Rayleigh criterion defines a surface to be smooth if \u03c3\u03b6 < \u03bb/(8 cos \u03b8), where \u03c3\u03b6 is the\nsurface height standard deviation, \u03b8 is the incidence angle with respect to the normal to\nthe surface. A more stringent condition is provided by the Fraunhofer criterion, which is\nused to define the far-field distance of an antenna, \u03c3\u03b6 < \u03bb/(32 cos \u03b8). A surface becomes\nsmooth under two conditions: \u03c3\u03b6 \u223c 0 or \u03b8 \u223c 90o . The effective roughness of the surface is\ntherefore \u03c3\u03b6 cos \u03b8 [Beckmann et al., 1963].\nSeveral aspects must be considered to understand the scattering phenomenon. We will\nexamine two limiting situation models. In one case, we can assume that the surface is\nmade up of many independent mirrors (specular points) whose contributions to the field\nadd up incoherently. The other limit is that of a surface which deviates from flatness only\nslightly. These two cases must be treated differently. The goal in both cases will be to\nunderstand the behavior of the received phase and modulus. Let us keep in mind in the\nback of our heads that, at the end, we should look at the relative phase between the two\navailable wavelengths, which should be a statistically better behaved quantity than either\nof the two phases.\n\n4.1\n\nStatistics of the field\n\nIn this subsection we briefly review some of the results in [Beckmann et al., 1963], concerning the sum\ni\u03c8\n\nU = re\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\nei\u03c6j .\n\n(4.1)\n\nj=1\n\nThis is relevant to understand what happens when we sum the fields in a rough reflection\nsituation. We state the result for two illuminating conditions:\n1. A uniformly distributed phase from \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0.\n2. A normal phase distribution with standard deviation \u03c3.\nIn the first case the resulting phase has again a uniformly distributed phase, but the modulus\n2\nhas the so-called Rayleigh distribution p(r) = 2r\nn exp(\u2212r /n)-and therefore has a non-zero\n1/2\naverage (the average is proportional to n ). In the second case we find that the components\n10\n\n\fof the resulting phasor are normally distributed (which is a quite general result following\ndirectly from the Central Limit Theorem) and that\n2\n\n2\n\nhr 2 i = n2 e\u2212\u03c3 + n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c3 ).\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn this beautiful expression we can see the coherent and incoherent contributions to the\nfield modulus. Beckmann summarizes:\nOutside a narrow cone (or wedge) about the direction of specular reflection,\nthe amplitude of the field scattered by a rough surface is always Rayleighdistributed; if the surface is very rough, and grazing incidence is excluded, the\namplitude of the scattered field is Rayleigh-distributed everywhere.\nThe specularly scattered field is composed of a coherent component and a random, Hoytdistributed component. When the surface is very rough, the latter becomes incoherent and\nthe former vanishes. In fact, if the surface height distribution is normal with deviation \u03c3\u03b6 ,\nthen\n2\n2\n(4.3)\nhr 2 i = n2 e\u2212(4\u03c0\u03c3\u03b6 cos \u03b8/\u03bb) + n(1 \u2212 e\u2212(4\u03c0\u03c3\u03b6 cos \u03b8/\u03bb) ).\nThus, we see that the magnitude of the reflected field should depend mainly on the ratio\nof significant wave height to wavelength. We will obtain a related result through more\nsophisticated analysis below.\nSome verification of these ideas via simulations can be found in [Daout et al., 1999],\nwhere the authors, using a 1-D bistatic scattering simulator, reproduce the mentioned\naspects of the phase statistical distribution. The surface is there simulated by facets, and\nthe Kirchhoff theory for the scattering field from each facet is used to accumulate the rays\nwith regard to their phase. The phase histograms they show verify very clearly the ideas\njust discussed. In particular, that the signal is very coherent at low elevations.\n\n4.2\n\nThe Fresnel-Huygens-Kirchhoff integral for the field\n\nThis is basically the scalar Kirchhoff approximation, valid for surfaces with large radii of\ncurvature compared to wavelength. Let the incoming field be described by1\nUo (p) =\n\neikr\n.\nr\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe Fresnel integral for the scattered field is (see [Born & Wolf, 1993, p. 380, eq. 17])\nU (p) =\n\n\u2212i\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nR*\n\neik(r+s)\n(~q * n\u0302) dS.\nrs\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe vector ~\nq = (~\nq\u22a5 , qz ) is the scattering vector: the vector normal to the plane that would\nspecularly reflect the rays in the direction we are looking. This vector is a function of the\nincoming and outgoing unit vectors ~ni and ~ns , ~q = k(n\u0302i \u2212 n\u0302s ). The scattering vector is\nrelated to the specular angle \u03b2 through cos \u03b2 = \u1e91 * q\u0302/q. Note, as an aside, that in the\nnadir case all wind direction dependence disappears (surface anisotropy). Changing wind\ndirection is akin to performing a rotation in the surface, and the integral is invariant under\nrotations in the nadir case. The nadir case is special because R[~q(~x)] = ~q(R[~x]).\n1\n\nHere we do a scalar treatment, think of U as a component of the field.\n\n11\n\n\f4.3\n\nGeometrical Optics\n\nThis is the process that dominates in specular scattering when the frequency is large (i.e.,\nthe wavelength is small compared to the wave height and to the surface correlation length).\nThe case of L-band scattering from the ocean is at best borderline \"high-frequency\", and\nwe are carrying out some separate studies within the framework of GNSS-OPPSCAT2 to\nunderstand the relevance of this approximation in such circumstances. To this end, we have\ndeveloped the speckles software tool, written in IDL (Interactive Data Language). In Geometrical Optics the surface height standard deviation is assumed to be at least of the order\nof the electromagnetic wavelength. According to the analysis in [Beckmann et al., 1963],\nthe resulting wave will be largely incoherent. There is an important ingredient in our situation, however, and that is because we have a Woodward Ambiguity Function (WAF) at\nour disposal to select a given surface patch, as we will see shortly. This means that we can\nfilter field contributions from a rather small area.\nIn the Geometrical Optics approximation to the Kirchhoff theory for electromagnetic\nscattering, the physical picture can be understood in terms of a specular point model.\nThat is, the field at the receiver is the superposition of the fields generated by a number of\n\"mirrors\" (not flat mirrors, thought, rather parabolic caps) on the scattering surface which\nare oriented in the correct manner. The radiation from each specular point is as coherent\nas the incoming radiation, but there is no coherence in the phase relationship between\nthe radiation out-coming from the different mirrors if the surface height distribution has\na large range. The result is that there is power at the receiver, but that the phase of the\nreceived signal is randomly distributed and the power is simply proportional to the number\nof scatterers. The behavior of the resulting phase will depend on the geometry, on the\nnumber and distribution of mirrors, and also on the temporal variation of these quantities.\nThe goal of this section is to understand this relationship and quantify it.\nIt is useful here to stop and give a physical picture of the specular point model-one of\nthe two ingredients in Geometrical Optics. We will treat here the radiation coming from\neach mirror separately, as was mentioned above. Since the size of each mirror is small\ncompared to the Fresnel zone, we can use the Fraunhofer approximation (plane waves all\nthe way through) to estimate the out-coming field.\nRecall that the Fresnel integral for the scattered field is\nU (p) =\n\n\u2212i\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nR*\n\neik(r+s)\n(~q * n\u0302) dS.\nrs\n\n(4.6)\n\nIn the far field (both emitter and receiver are very far compared to the size of the scatterer,\ni.e, the size of the scatterer is much smaller that the Fresnel zone), and since our integral\nis near a specular point with n\u0302 \u2248 q\u0302, we find that\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212i eik(r +s )\nU (p) =\n4\u03c0 r \u2032 s\u2032\n\nZ\n\nR * e\u2212i~q*~r (~q * n\u0302) dS,\n\n(4.7)\n\nsee Figure 4.1 for a pictorial definition of the involved vectors. Here all we have done is\nto approximate k(r + s) \u2248 k(r \u2032 + s\u2032 ) \u2212 ~q * ~r. Now, let us focus on a single specular point:\nimagine that there is only one specular point on the surface. This means ~q * n\u0302 = q. To\nperform the integral let us use a coordinate system in which the z axis is parallel to ~q. In\n2\n\nESA Contract 13461/99/NL/GD, Utilization of Scatterometry Using Sources of Opportunity.\n\n12\n\n\fz\n\nki\n\nr \u0301\n\nr\n\nr\nx\n0\n\nFigure 4.1: Vector geometry for scattering.\nthis coordinate system the tangent plane at the specular plane is therefore parallel to the\n2\nx-y plane.

The result is then immediate (the radius of curvature is the inverse\nof the second derivative in such coordinates and the matrix becomes diagonal in such a\ncoordinate system, so the computation of the determinant just yields the product of the\ndiagonal terms).

Basically, this is a high frequency approximation-q has to be large. Let\nus look at things in 1D, along one of the radii of curvature.

The\nexpression for the incoherent sum of all the specular points is now immediate from Equation\n4.14, given a large height deviation. This expression for the field is also useful for a not-soincoherent sum of the fields-we will return to this point below.\n\n4.3.1\n\nCorrections to the Geometrical Optics approximation: frequency\ndependence\n\nIn this section we add a comment on the next order corrections to the Geometrical Optics\napproximation. This is not a crucial section for the work at hand and can be taken as a\nsmall aside, but we believe it will be useful in future work.\nIn reality the surface is not a parabola and other terms appear. These are frequency\ndependent corrections to the field. In order to obtain the corrections we need to expand\nthe integrand as a Taylor series beyond the well-behaved parabolic term. The basic idea\nfor this type of computation is that\nI(b) =\nand that\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212ax\n\ndn\nI(b)\ndbn\n\n2 +bx\n\n=\nb=0\n\n2 /4a\n\ndx = e\u2212b\n\nZ\n\n14\n\ne\u2212ax\n\n2 +bx\n\nq\n\n\u03c0/a,\n\nxn dx.\n\n\fFrom this we can compute\nZ\n\nThe expansion is\nI=q\nwhere\nI4 = q Rspece\u2212iq zspec\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ne\u2212ax x4 dx =\n\n12 q\n\u03c0/a.\n(4a)2\n\nR * e\u2212iq z(x,y) d2 ~x = I0 + I4 + ..., .\n\n\u2212iq 4\n\u2207ijkl z\n4!\n\nspec\n\nZ\n\n\u2212i q2 \u22072ij z |\n\nxi xj xk xl e\n\n(4.18)\n\nspec\n\nxi xj\n\nd2 ~x.\n\n(4.19)\n\nNow,\n\u2212iq zspec \u2212iq\n\nI4 = q Rspec e\n\n\u22074ijkl z\n\n4!\n\u2212iq\n= q Rspec e\u2212iq zspec\n\u22074ijkl z\n4!\n\u0012\n\n\u2212iq\u22072ij z\n\nspec\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\nspec\nspec\n\n\u2212iq\u22072kl z\n\nZ\n\n\u2212i 2q \u22072ij z |\n\nxi xj xk xl e\n\nspec\n\nxi xj\n\nd2 ~x\n\n(4.20)\n\n+\n\nspec\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n2\u03c0\n\u2212iq det\n\n1/2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22072ij z\nspec\n\n(4.21)\n\n\u0013\n\nand\nI4 = Rspec e\u2212iq zspec\n\n\u221a\n\u22122\u03c0 r1 r2\nRspece\u2212iq zspec \u22074ijkl z\nq 4!\n\nspec\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22072ij z\n\nspec\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\n\u22072kl z\n\nspec\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n(4.22)\nIn a future implementation of speckles (see discussion below), we would like to include\nthese second order effects. These effects can also be accounted for theoretically using,\ne.g., Gaussian statistics. At the end the final expression must depend only on the usual\nparameters. Note that the I4 has units of length. Thus, aside from constants, these\n\u03c3\nhigher order corrections may be of the form l*q\u03b6 , say. In this last expression we see that\nthis correction is indeed inversely proportional to frequency, as it should, since Geometric\nOptics is a high frequency limit.\n\n4.4\n\nThe WAF zone\n\nIf the signal is filtered by cross-correlation with several C/A (or P) code periods at the\ndelay and frequencies corresponding to the specular zone, for instance, only the surface\npatch in the first Delay and Doppler zone will contribute (let us call it the \"WAF zone\"\nto associate as well as distinguish this concept from the concept of Fresnel zone). This is\ndescribed by the equation\n\u03bb2\n1\n*\nSNR(\u03c4, fc ) =\nkTS BD (4\u03c0)3\n\nZ\n\nPt Gt Gr 0 2\n\u03c3 \u03c7 (~\n\u03c1, t, \u03b4\u03c4, \u03b4f ) dA.\nR12 R22 rt\n\nwhich is a slight refinement of a similar equation in [Zavorotny et al., 1999] and which can\nbe found in the review [Ruffini et al., 1999]. The important thing to keep in mind is that\nthe support in the integrand, the WAF zone, is the intersection of four spatial zones:\n1. The receiver antenna footprint.\n15\n\n\f2. The annulus zone defined by the \u039b2 function in \u03c72 .\n3. The Doppler zone defined by the |S|2 function in \u03c72 .\n4. The scattering cross section coefficient \u03c30 .\nThe WAF, through its support, selects a given portion of the surface from which power\nis measured.\nTo get a feeling for these numbers, the area involved in the reflection is of the order of\n10 km2 for an aircraft and 1000 km2 for a Low Earth Orbiter. For h >> c\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is\nthe chip length (1 \u03bcs for C/A code) and h the receiver height), the one-WAF (or one-chip\nhere) area can be approximated by AW AF = 2\u03c0hc\u03c4 / cos2 \u03b8. Note that AW AF increases only\nlinearly with altitude.\nWe can add another element at this point. In the above discussion, the WAF is assumed\nto result from choosing a given delay and Doppler in the reflected signal. However, as time\npasses the signal reflected by a given surface element cannot be characterized by a fixed\nDelay and Doppler: both will change as the situation evolves. It is clear, however, that\na more sophisticated WAF algorithm can be devised that focuses on that specific surface\npatch. This observation opens the door to longer integration times, which can be useful for\naltimetric purposes.\n\nFigure 4.2: Nadir case first chip radius size for C/A and P codes. This is for a\u221astatic situation, no Doppler filtering affects the result (based on the simple formula s = 2 \u2217 h \u2217 \u03c4c ),\nwhere \u03c4c is the chip length in meters (300 m for C/A code).\n16\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nSimulation Tools: fresnel and\nspeckles\nThese are two modeling tools we have developed to understand, via a computer simulation,\nsome of the characteristics of the reflected field. fresnel models the reflected field (just the\ncarrier part after removing the source time-dependence) using an ocean model and direct\nintegration of the Fresnel-Huygens-Kirchhoff integral described above. We have carried out\nseveral types of simulations: a slowly vertically moving receiver, a static receiver, a realistic\nocean and a so-called chaotic ocean. We will focus here on the static realistic ocean case.\nspeckles has been developed with two goals in mind. We will eventually attempt\nto compute the reflected field using a GO method: finding first the specular points and\nintegrating just around these to sum up the resulting field. We will just outline here\nsome of its characteristics and initial results. We have found that this is very difficult to\ndo (in general, comparisons with the Fresnel integral are poor). We have seen, however\nthat the number of specular points correlates reasonably well with the reflected Fresnel\nfield, specially in rough ocean simulated conditions. We are attempting to understand\nthis phenomenon better, and to study its implications: GO, in some form of another, is\npresently the leading model used for the analysis of reflected power in GPSR. It is a simple\nmethod, and experimental results to date seem to validate it. We would like to understand\nits somewhat puzzling high performance, since L-band is not really high-frequency in the\nocean surface case. That is, GO is not, strictly speaking applicable in the whole range\nof ocean conditions with an L-band instrument-the wavelength in neither large of short\nenough. Nonetheless, some semi-empirical modifications of this model are currently being\nsuccessfully used. We would like to understand this success and, more importantly, its\nlimitations. We will briefly mention some of this work, although it is not central to the\nstudy.\n\n5.1\n\nfresnel\n\nThis routine ( written in Interactive Data Language-IDL) integrates the field from the\nocean surface below, using nadir incidence. The receiver is hovering a few meters over\nthe water. The ocean model is Gaussian (we use a routine from B. Chapron using the\nElfouhaily spectrum) [Elfouhaily et al., 1997], \"chaotic\" (random heights, moving) and a\nnon-Gaussian simulations are planned for future work. The software simulates the reflected\ncomplex field at L1, L2 and L5 frequencies. The goals of this part of the work were to show\n17\n\n\fthat the simulation is possible, to compare the behavior of the field in the different cases,\nand to assess the potential of the PIP idea.\n\n5.1.1\n\nRandom ocean\n\nThe random ocean is generated by choosing a height standard deviation. The code assigns\na random height with the desired characteristic to each 10 cm by 10 cm square of the\nreflecting surface. In addition, a velocity random field is chosen, and each square moves up\nand down with a chosen period.\n\n5.1.2\n\nElfouhaily spectrum\n\nThe procedure to compute the ocean state, based on the IDL routine kindly supplied by B.\nChapron, is, starting from the energy spectrum, to generate a plausible random spectrum.\nTo do this, the square root of the energy spectrum is taken, and a uniformly random phase\nappended to it. The appropriate time dependence is also added to this random phase-\nusing the dispersion relation for gravity ocean waves. Then, the inverse Fourier transform\nis taken. Using this procedure, a moving, random ocean with the appropriate spectral\ncharacteristics is generated. Using a uniform random phase distribution in the different\nfrequencies means that the resulting ocean is Gaussian. This can be changed, of course,\nbut we have not attempted to analyze the subtleties of non-uniform phase distributions in\nthis work.\nGenerally the sea state is characterized by its power spectrum. As the sea evolves in a\nrandom process, the spectral density of sea elevations is obtained by the Fourier transform\nof the autocorrelation function of the elevations \u03b6(x, y). The spectral density can also be\nestimated by the Fourier transform of one realization of \u03b6(x, y) [Blackman and Tukey, 1958]:\nF (kx , ky ) = |T F [\u03b6(x, y)]|2\nIf we determine the matrix \u03c6 of random phases uniformly distributed between 0 and 2\u03c0,\nthe sea height at the point r = (x, y) is:\nq\n\n\u03b6(r) = T F \u22121 [ F (kx , ky )ei\u03c6 ]\nThus the probability density functions of heights and slopes are Gaussian. For this study\nwe use the unified spectrum of [Elfouhaily et al., 1997]. This is just a consequence of the\nCentral Limit Theorem applied to sums of harmonics.\n\n5.1.3\n\nField calculation\n\nThe field is calculated as a complex number using the Fresnel integral expression:\nU (p) =\n\n\u2212i\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nR*\n\neik(r+s)\n(~q * n\u0302) dS.\nrs\n\n(5.1)\n\nTo be precise, we Fraunhofer-expand the part of the integrand corresponding to s the\ndistance to the infinitely far transmitter. That is, we write s = ks\u2032 \u2212 ~kin * ~x in the phase\npart of the integrand, where ~x denotes the position of the scattering point. Thus, the\nintegrand becomes,\n\u2032 Z\n~\neikr\u2212kin *~x\n\u2212i eiks\n(~q * n\u0302) dS.\n(5.2)\nR\n*\nU (p) =\n4\u03c0 s\u2032\nr\n18\n\n\fWe actually throw out all the s\u2032 dependence (in effect assuming an incoming plane wave,\nas well as on the Fresnel coefficient ) and obtain\n\u2212i\nU (p) =\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n~\n\neikr\u2212kin *~x\nR*\n(~q * n\u0302) dS.\nr\n\n(5.3)\n\nThis means that the outgoing field would be a plane wave if the surface were flat, with unit\nmodulus.\nThe ocean surface is divided into squares 10 cm wide (or less), and an area of up to\n200x200 meters is\n\u221a integrated. For the most part we will concentrate on the first chip zone,\nwith radius r = 2 \u2217 h \u2217 \u03c4c .\nThe resulting field is a complex number in this scalar treatment, U (p(t)) = rei\u03c6(t) . In\norder to evaluate the phase as the receiver moves up we take\n\u03b4\u03c6i = ln(w(ti )/w(ti\u22121 ))\n\n(5.4)\n\nwith w(t) = ei\u03c6(t) . Summing the \u03b4\u03c6i yields the overall phase. This method is related to\nthe definition of winding number of a curve around the origin in the complex plane:\nI=\n\nI\n\n\u03b3\n\ndz\n=\nz\n\nI\n\nd(ln z) =\n\n\u03b3\n\nX\ni\n\nln\n\nzi\nzi\u22121\n\n.\n\n(5.5)\n\nA full cycle, 360 degrees, is equivalent to 19 (L1), 24 (L2), 25 (L5), 86 (L12) or 568 (L25)\ncm. We will return to this definition shortly.\n\n5.2\n\nspeckles\n\nAs mentioned above, this code has been developed to study the use of Geometric Optics for\nthe study of ocean surface reflections in L-band. It will also be used to study specular point\nstatistics, using both Gaussian and, eventually, non-Gaussian models. Taking a Gaussian\nocean model, we determine the specular points distribution and compute the reflected field\nusing geometrical optics. We are to compare this to straight integration of Fresnel integral.\nThen the analysis will be compared with a non-linear ocean model.\n\n5.2.1\n\nSpecular point determination\n\nWe consider the incident radiation as a plane wave normal to a Gaussian surface and a\nreceiver at (xr , yr , zr ). The point (x, y, \u03b6) of the surface is considered to be a specular point\nif the slopes follow rather clear geometrical conditions (see for instance [D.E.Freund 1997]):\nx \u2212 xr\nd\u03b6\n=\ndx\nzr \u2212 \u03b6\n\n(5.6)\n\ny \u2212 yr\nd\u03b6\n=\n.\ndy\nzr \u2212 \u03b6\n\n(5.7)\n\nOur approach consists in the detection of slope variations around the expected specular\nslopes defined above. We compute at each point P of the surface, and for both directions\nx and y, the expected specular slope S-i.e. the slope needed to reflect the incident wave\nto the receiver-and the slopes of the facets located just before (slope S[before]) and after\n(slope S[after]) the point P. The condition for P to be a speckle is that (S[before]-S) and\n19\n\n\f(S -S[after]) must be of the same sign. This determination is attractive because we doesn't\nneed to define any tolerance on the specular slopes. We are neglecting saddle point by this\napproch (saddle points are not well defined in discrete spaces).\nThen an analysis is made on the radius of curvature at the specular point. The Kirchhoff\napproximation leads to a condition on the radius of curvature at the specular facet,\nq \u221a\n\nq r1 r2 > 10.\n\n(5.8)\n\nThe product of the principal radii of curvature can be computed using the derivatives of\n\nFigure 5.1: Fresnel contours for the 10 by 10 surface patch under and 8 meter high\nreceiver. U10=8 m/s. The colored contours represent the ocean instantaneous topography,\nwith higher areas represented brighter. The line pairs are iso-lambda delay curves for L1\nand L2 (4, 10 and 20 lambdas are shown).\n\n20\n\n\f\u03b6(r), see [Barrick, 1968]:\n|r1 r2 | =\n\n\u0010\n\n1 + \u03b6x2 + \u03b6y2\n\n\u00112\n\n2\n\u03b6xx \u03b6yy \u2212 \u03b6xy\n\nThe following Figures (5.2 to 5.4) present the specular point position (circles) for three\ndifferent times on the moving surface. The receiver is located at 8 meters above the surface,\nwhich has a 5 m by 5 m dimension and 1 cm of resolution. The stars correspond to the\nspecular points that are under the curvature condition. The specular distribution is greatly\nmodified within 10 ms.\n\nFigure 5.2: Specular points position for Time = 0 s\n\nFigure 5.3: Specular points position for Time = 10 ms\n\n5.2.2\n\nField computation\n\nThe idea is to compute the Fresnel field with the contribution of scatterers only. We\nintegrate on the vicinity of each mirror. The result is then compared to the straight Fresnel\n21\n\n\fFigure 5.4: Specular points position for Time = 20 ms\ncomputation. To date these comparisons have not been very successful. It appears that\nin order for the Geometric Optics approach to work at this level (not after substantial\naveraging) we need to impose more stringent frequency or surface scale characteristics\nand/or take into account higher order effects. If the main contribution is from specular\npoints, as we suspect, the key may be to calculate the field from each scatterer to higher\norder than the stationary phase approximation. Work in this area is planned for the future.\n\n22\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nCoherence and Structure Functions\n6.1\n\nThe coherence and structure functions, and the coherence time\n\nAnother question that needs to be answered is how the sea surface motion and varying\ngeometry affect the coherence of the reflected signal. There are several models for the\nsea spectrum, and these can be used to try to extract this information. Consider the\ntoy model of one-dimensional scattering, with static, lined up, receiver and transmitter,\nwith the scatterer (a single facet) also in line but now moving up and down with average\nspeed v. It is easy to see that the correlation of the direct and the scattered signal is zero\nunless the coherent integration time is less than the characteristic time of the surface at\nGPS wavelengths. The coherent integration time is roughly that time for which the RMS\nphase error is 1 radian [Thomson et al., 1990]. More precisely, let the coherence function\nbe defined by\nZ\n1 T i\u03c6(t)\ne\ndt ,\n(6.1)\nc(T ) =\nT 0\nwhere \u03c6(t) is the error phase. Then, the coherence time is the time T it takes for hC(T )2 i to\ndrop to 0.5-say [Thomson et al., 1990]. Note that for long times the coherence function\ncan also be related to the magnitude of the zero-frequency spectral component of the\n(windowed) normalized field associated to the error phase (that is, in our simulations, the\nFourier transform of the normalized field). We will get back to this point below.\nThe coherence time of the GPS signal is about 2\u20133 hours. What about the reflected\nsignal? If the WAF zone and the sea surface are fixed, we should expect the same. If we\ninclude time dependence (and we ignore all motions), we can rewrite the equation on the\nstatistics of the signal by\nU (t) = rei\u03c8 =\n\nX\n\nei\u03c6j \u2212i\u03c9t = e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\nj\n\nX\n\nei\u03c6j ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nj\n\nso the resulting field is as coherent as the incident one. But in real situations neither of this\nis the case. Both the ocean surface and the WAF patch are moving (although this second\neffect can be corrected in principle by the use of SAR techniques). The characteristic time\nof the surface can roughly be defined as the time it takes the surface to move a wavelength-\nin the present case \u03bb/v. This thought experiment is useful to understand the limitation\nin coherent integration time for a moving surface like the ocean. An advantage of using\n23\n\n\fa synthetic wavelength using two GNSS frequencies is that this coherent integration time\nshould be longer. We will verify in a moment that this is the case.\nAn associated concept to the coherence function is the structure function of the phase.\nThis is defined by\ns(T ) = h(\u03c6(t + T ) \u2212 \u03c6(t))2 it .\n(6.3)\nIt gives us a measure of how tied up are two points in the phase as we vary their temporal\nseparation. If this phase drift can be approximated by a random walk stochastic process\n[Herring, 1990],\ns(T ) = d * T\n(6.4)\n\u221a\nwe can use the associated \"Geophysically Induced Phase drift\" (GIP) rate d as a geophysical parameter if it correlates well to U10 in our models. This parameters has units of\ncycle per square root second. We will check this below (but let us anticipate that it does).\nThe coherence time and the structure function are related. In fact,\nhC(T )2 i =\n\n1\nT2\n\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\nhei(\u03c6(t)\u2212\u03c6(t )) idt dt\u2032 .\n\n(6.5)\n\nIf we assume Gaussian statistics for the phase fluctuations [Thomson et al., 1990] we can\nsimplify things considerably,\nhC(T )2 i =\n=\n\nT\nT\n1\n\u2032\ne\u2212s(t \u2212t)/2 dt dt\u2032 .\n2\nT 0 0\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n2 T\n\u03c4\ne\u2212s(\u03c4 )/2 d\u03c4.\n1\u2212\nT 0\nT\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(6.6)\n(6.7)\n\nFor a random walk process, then,\nhC(T )2 i =\n\n2\nT\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nT\n\n\u0013\n\ne\u2212d*\u03c4 /2 d\u03c4.\n\n(6.8)\n\nSee Figure 6.1 for a graph of this function for various drift rates.\nNote that in this model hC(T )2 i decreases to zero as time increases. This fact alerts us\nthat there is something amiss: we see in our simulations large phase excursions (certainly\nmuch larger than a cycle), but there is coherence left at large times-see Figures 6.2, 6.3, 6.4\nand 6.5. How is this possible? The Gaussian model for phase fluctuations does not really\napply to our situation, however. Gaussian means that phase excursions probabilities are\nbell-shaped, of course. Are they? In our simulations the phase of the reflected signal gathers\nabout a point in the complex plane-the field does seem to have a Gaussian distribution\nabout an average point. The cumulative phase does not have to have such a distribution,\nhowever. In fact, it could conceivably indulge in arbitrarily large excursions while spending\nmore time in that average field point: this would still result in a Gaussian field distribution.\nHowever, the probability distribution for such a phase history would not be a Gaussian\ndistribution (centered about 0, say). It would consist of a series of Gaussian-like humps\nspaced one cycle apart, with the one about zero the largest. In this situation we could\nwell have a very long coherence time (since the phase modulo 2\u03c0 could be a rather narrow\nGaussian distribution about a point) while the structure function may show high drift. This\ntype of behavior is evident in our simulations when plotting the field points (see Figure 6.6).\nNote that the interferometric signal has a stronger average field value. See Figure 6.7 for a\nhistogram of the L25 cumulative phase illustrating the multiple-hump distribution that we\nalluded to.\n24\n\n\fFigure 6.1: hC(T )2 i for a random walk with drift rates of\nper square root second.\n\n25\n\n\u221a\nd =0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 cycles\n\n\fFigure 6.2: This is a plot with the structure function (left) and the coherence function\nfor the case U10=6 m/s, 43 m side 10 cm resolution simulation at 8 m height.

See next Figure\nfor further analysis of this particular simulation.\n\n29\n\n\fFigure 6.6: Refer to the previous figure. This is a plot of the field in the complex plane\nfor L2 , L5 and L25 , and it serves to illuminate the difference between the structure function\nand the coherence function. The field mean for L2 is (-0.06,-0.1), for L5 is (-0.1,-0.1), and\nfor L25 (-0.6,-0.20), much larger. The standard deviation is about 1 for all of them. In this\n19 meter simulation, U10=4 m/s, height standard deviation was 12 cm, receiver height 8\nm.\n30\n\n\fFigure 6.7: In these two plots we depict the phase and phase histogram for the L25 field\nin the previous figure. The highest peak corresponds to the initial zero phase.\n\n31\n\n\fNotice that the above discussion is relevant to understand the coherence properties that\nwere found in the Bridge Experiment reflected signal (integration times where of 10 ms,\nshort enough for the static approximation to work in that geometry). In longer time scales\nthe accumulated phase will pick up a random component, but if there is an overall phase\nchange (due for instance, to a tide) it should be distinguishable from the random part\n(which should not add nor subtract to the overall phase on the average).\n\n6.2\n\nDoppler spread of the reflected signal\n\nAnother thought experiment is useful. Imagine that the surface height is varying as a\nfunction of time as\n\u03b6(t) = \u03b1t + Ar(t),\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant and the second term adds a random, noise-like displacement between\n\u2212A and A. We can think of this as the effect of a tide superimposed on the wave motion on the sea. The scattered phase will not be coherent if A is large enough, but the\naccumulated phase will certainly contain information about \u03b1. What happens if there are\nmany scatterers, how fast is the residual phase varying? This will give us a feel for the\nPhase Lock Loop (PLL) bandwidth required for tracking. It is not hard to see that the\nbandwidth required will be less than 100 Hz (assuming that the sea surface vertical speed\nis not greater than 10 m/s), in a static geometry (or if a static-WAF is used). The largest\nfrequency present in the signal cannot be greater than the contribution due to the fastest\nmoving surface patch-the result is always the linear combination of such contributions,\nP\nU (t) \u223c rei\u03c8(t) = nj=1 ei\u03c6j (t) . Now, if the maximal orbital velocity for a wave is 10 m/s\n(see Figure 6.8, this implies a Doppler of 2 \u00d7 10/\u03bb \u2248 100 Hz (remember that the signal is\nbouncing off the surface). Thus, a sampling rate of at least 200 Hz is required to retrieve\nthe phase of the reflected signal (even if the SNR is high enough). In our simulations we\nhave seen that it is safe to sample the signal at such rate.\nHere is another useful question: given that a receiving LEO is moving at, say, 7 km/s,\nwould it be possible to integrate coherently (correlate) the direct and reflected signals for\n1 ms, if the LEO antenna has a footprint of 10 meters? Note that this \"eye on the sea\" is\nmoving very fast over the surface, and this is introducing a random, time-dependent phase\nto the signal. The answer is no. But if the footprint is enlarged enough, yes. This may\nbe an important problem for the PIP, but there are ways through which it could be fixed.\nOne obvious one is to use a WAF that sticks to a given surface patch, or that it moves\nslowly over the sea surface. Some of these ideas are discussed within the context of the\nGNSS-OPPSCAT project (Report WP3320). To get an idea of the induced Doppler, we\ncan reason that the scattered field is just a sum of the type\nF = R(t)ei\u03a6(t) \u2248\n\nN\nX\n\nri (t)ei\u03c6i (t) ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhich already looks like a Fourier sum if we approximate ri (t) as constant and the exponent\nby its first derivative. Thus, we can guess that the maximum frequency in the spectrum is\nsimply Doppler due to the fastest moving patch on the ocean. As an upper bound we can\nuse 10 m/s-see Figure 6.9. Multiplying times 2 and dividing by \u03bb we obtain a scattering\nDoppler of about 100 Hz.\n\n32\n\n\fTo be a bit more precise, let us write\nF =\n\nZ\n\niqz z 2\n\ne\n\nd x=\n\nAW AF\n\nZ\n\neiqz (z0 +\u017ct) d2 x,\n\nAW AF\n\nusing the simpler backscattering expression in the Fraunhofer zone. Notice the restriction\nof the integral to the (static) WAF zone. Let us now rewrite the transform of the field:\nZ\n\nF\u0303 (\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\n\u223c\n\ni\u03c9t\n\nFe\n\ndt =\n\nA(q \u017c\u2261\u03c9)\n\nZ\n\niqz zo\n\ne\n\ne\u2212iqz zo d2 x,\n\nZ\n\nei(\u03c9t\u2212qz \u017c) dtdx\n\nif we assume that vertical motions take over a \"long enough\" time compared to the time\nscale associated to the frequency we are interested in. This is saying that the spectral\ncomponent at a given frequency is proportional to the area on the surface moving at the\nright speed to produce that frequency.\nWe can extend this reasoning to the moving-receiver case. There are two limiting\nsituations we can think about. One is the \"high gain\" situation. Let us first discuss this\nsituation-we will get back to the low gain situation at the end. Assume for now the\nocean is frozen. In this situation the WAF zone is very small (due to antenna or processing\ngain) and coherence time is definitely influenced by the fact that as the receiver moves the\ncontributing surface is changing. If the WAF zone is smaller than the correlation length of\nthe ocean (certainly an extreme case, but never mind), the coherence time is limited by l/v,\nwhere v is the receiver speed and l is the correlation length of the surface-assuming large\nenough height deviations. To be more precise, if we use a replica with fixed Doppler and\nDelay, the \"eye on the sea\" will move over the ocean at a speed similar to the receiver's.\nThis will introduce additional bandwidth in the carrier if the ocean is rough-even if is\nfrozen. This bandwidth will be mainly proportional to ocean surface rugosity, not to ocean\nsurface motion. It can be very large (kHz), depending on the receiver speed and the WAF\narea size. Following the above reasoning, and keeping in mind that the WAF zone is now\na moving filter on the ocean surface,\nZ\n\nF (t) =\n\neiqz z(~x) d2 x =\n\nAW AF (t)\n\nZ\n\n=\n\n\u039eW AF (~x \u2212 ~v t) eiqz z(~x) d2 x\n\n\u039eW AF (~x) eiqz z(~x+~vt) d2 x\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nZ\n\neiqz z(~x+~vt) d2 x\n\nAW AF\n\nNow let us look at \u1e1e (t):\n\u1e1e (t) = ~v *\n\nZ\n\nAW AF\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n~ eiqz z(~x+~vt) d2 x = ~v *\n\u2207\n\nZ\n\neiqz z(~x+~vt) n\u0302 dl\n\n(6.9)\n\n\u2202AW AF\n\nwhere the last is an integral over the boundary of the WAF area and ~n is the normal to\nthe boundary. The result illustrates the \"edge effect\", i.e., that the change is just due\nto the change at the boundary of the WAF area. We have used a 2D version of Green's\ntheorem in the last step. This equation says that the change in the field is proportional to\nthe variation of the field contribution at the edges of the WAF area (properly mapped in\nthe velocity direction). The faster the velocity and the larger the difference, the larger the\n33\n\n\frate of change of the field. To relate this to the spectrum, note that this will contribute\na high frequency componene to the spectrum. Whether this is a relatively large or small\ncontribution depends on the total field, which is proportional to the total area. Thus,\nfor large WAF zones this high frequency effect contributes a small portion of the total\nspectrum.\nIf we allow for a moving surface, z = z(~x, t) it is readily seen that the complete result\nis the sum of two distinct effects:\n\u1e1e (t) = ~v *\n\nZ\n\niqz z(~\nx+~\nv t,t)\n\ne\n\nn\u0302 dl +\n\n\u2202AW AF\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\n\u039eW AF (~x \u2212 ~v t) \u2202t eiqz z(~x,t) d2 x.\n\n\u0011\n\n(6.10)\n\nZ\n\n\u039eW AF (~x \u2212 ~v t) eiqz z(~x) d2 x\n\n(6.11)\n\nLet us now return to\nF (t) =\n\nZ\n\niqz z(~\nx) 2\n\ne\n\nd x=\n\nAW AF (t)\n\nand compute the Fourier transform:\nF\u0303 (\u03c9) =\n\nZ Z\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt ei\u03c9t \u039eW AF (~x \u2212 ~v t) eiqz z(~x) d2 x.\n\n(6.12)\n\nTo evaluate this, let us assume for simplicity and without loss of generality that \u039eW AF is\na box of size S moving along in the x direction with velocity vx :\n\u039eW AF (~x \u2212 ~v t) = \u039ex (x \u2212 vx t) * \u039ey (y).\nThen\nZ\n\nHence,\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt ei\u03c9t \u039eW AF (~x \u2212 ~v t) = 2\n\nF\u0303 (\u03c9) =\n\n2 sin(\u03c9S/vx )\n\u03c9\n\nZ\n\n\u039ey (y)ei\u03c9x/vx\nsin(\u03c9S/vx ).\nw\n\n\u039ey (y) ei\u03c9x/vx eiqz z(~x) d2 x.\n\n(6.13)\n\n(6.14)\n\n(6.15)\n\nThe characteristic time is roughly given by S/vx , as can be seen from the multiplying sinc.\nFrequencies higher than vx /S are supressed by this factor. The power in frequencies smaller\nthan this are modulated by the horizontal roughness of exp iqz z(~x) in the scale defined by\nvx /\u03c9 in the direction of motion: if the surface does not vary in that scale, there will be\nlittle power at the frequency vx /S.\nIn this approximation we have implicitly assumed a very small WAF in relation to the\ngeometry, since we have worked in the Fraunhofer approximation. This means that all the\npoints in the reflecting patch have the same geometry and generate the same geometrically\ninduced Doppler. In recent experimental conditions this is hardly the case, and the Doppler\nof the reflected signal is dominated by the Doppler amplitude of the WAF and glistening\nzones. If the glistening zone is large enough, then radiation will be received from the entire\nWAF. The Doppler span of the WAF zone determines then the Doppler spread of the\nreceived field. This is the basic mechanism for Delay-Doppler mapping and the basis for\nthe relationship betweeen waveforms and the characteristics of the sea surface. Even if we\nrestrict the signal to the first chip in the C/A code, there will be quite a bit of geometric\nDoppler. This second source of Doppler is in principle removable by many means: high\nantenna gain or processing gain. By any of these means we can reduce the patch to the\nFraunhofer zone mantaining SNR. It will then become increasingly important to use SAR\n34\n\n\fTi (ms)\n1\n5\n10\n20\n50\n\nOcean motion (Hz)\n200\n200\n200\n200\n200\n\nGeometric (Hz)\n1000\n200\n100\n50\n20\n\nEdge (Hz)\n1\n7\n14\n28\n70\n\nTable 6.1: Back of the envelope calculations for Doppler spread induced by ocean motion,\ngeometry and edge effects. Note that above 20 ms edge effects force the use of focusing.\ntechniques to focus and eliminate the edge effect we just discussed. We plan to revisit these\ncalculations extending them to the Fresnel zone in future work.\nThe ultimate limit to the Doppler width and therefore to the coherent integration time\nof the signal is ocean motion\u2013that cannot be anticipated and compensated\nfor.\n\u221a\nThe size of the first Fresnel zone for a receiver at 350 km is about 2 2h\u03bb or about 1 km.\nIn this narrow area, the geometric Doppler spans about 200 Hz edge to edge (the receiver\nlooking down and is moving along at 7 km/s) and the corresponding integration time is 5\nms. This Doppler is of the same order of magnitude of ocean induced spread. Integration\ntimes longer than 10 ms will certainly begin to be sensitive to ocean motion. The edge\neffect we discussed earlier will also start to play a role at longer integration times : for a 1\nkm WAF (roughly corresponding to 5 ms integration time) the corresponding frequency is\nof 7 Hz- still too small to make spotlight processing necessary. This may be the best way\nto retrieve ocean induced Doppler spread. See Table-6.1 for a summary of these ideas.\nWe have two different new ways to extract sea-state information from the Carrier bandwidth, by playing with the eye location. One the one hand, we can use a static WAF to\nmeasure vertical velocities-this will entail using SAR techniques from moving platforms.\nOn the other, we can measure surface roughness by letting the WAF drift over the surface\nat a speed of choice. This is just a matter of tuning the matched filter appropriately, and\nit could even be done from a static platform.\n\n35\n\n\fFigure 6.8: The ocean surface and vertical velocity for a wind of U 10 = 8 m/s, Elfouhaily\nspectrum.

An approach to\nthis problem is to rewrite the Fresnel integral using the \"zone\" concept. That is, we classify\nareas in the surface according to their distance to the receiver. We assume we are in the\nFraunhofer-emitter zone, so the distance to the emitter plays no role in this discussion. The\nidea is then to rewrite the field as a sum of field contributions from equal delay (r)zones:\nUq = q\n\nrmax\n\nZ\n\nrmin\n\neiqr A\u2032 (r)dr.\n\nThis idea can be found in [Berry, 1972]. The function A\u2032 (r) is an \"areal\" density function\nthat takes into account how much area contributes to each zone. It's exact expression is\nnot of immediate concern. In the case of a flat surface it just becomes one. In order to\nextend the integration over the whole r-axis, let us simply extend the definition of A\u2032 (r) to\nbe zero outside rmin and rmax . We then have,\nUq = q\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\neiqr A\u2032 (r)dr.\n\nWe can now read: the field is the Fourier transform of A\u2032 (r). And the question about the\nrelationship of the field between frequencies becomes a question on the relationship between\nthe Fourier components of this areal function at different frequencies.\nLet us forget for now the meaning of the areal function, and just think in terms of the\nFourier transform of a function with limited support, since we are looking at the Fourier\ntransform of a function with support L \u2261 rmin \u2212 rmax . The larger the support of the\nfunction, the more small-scale structure can be found in the Fourier transform-everything\nelse the same. We are accostumed to thinking about this fact in the opposite domain:\na function with a lot of small time-scale structure will have a large bandwidth-a large\nsupport in the frequncy domain.\nIntuitively, the larger the support two given nearby frequency components will end up\nsampling the pulse at more separated regions. It is useful to think about two sine functions\nof slightly different frequencies, running side by side. As a rule of thumb, we expect that the\n38\n\n\fcorrelation between these Fourier components will be sensitive to the correlation function\nof the (areal) function at a distance (\u2206\u03bb) \u2217 L/\u03bbmean . This is because \u2206\u03bb is the sampling\ndistance difference gained per cycle, and \u2217L/\u03bbmean is the number of cycles available in a\nregion of size L. Therefore, before carrying out any calculation we can say that if the\nareal function is correlated at the distance dictated by this (maximal possible) frequency\nseparation, then we will see correlation in the fields. It helps to look at the separation\nbetween the equi-delay contours in the surface of integration. If this separation is smaller\nthan the correlation length of the surface, then high correlation between the fields is possible.\nThere is an extra consideration, however. We have been assuming that the separation\nbetween contours is constant, but this is not the case. That is, we have been implicitly\nassuming that the contours are fixed on the surface, and all we have considered is the\ncorrelation between this contours. But in fact, as the ocean moves, the contours move,\nespecially with large seas. This introduces an additional source of decorrelation, which gets\nworse with larger seas. The time-correlation between the fields is given by\nhUq1 Uq\u22172 it = q1 q2\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\nhA\u20321 (r)A\u20322 (r \u2032 )it eiq1 r\u2212iq2 r drdr \u2032 .\n\nThis is a difficult beast to deal with, so we will change strategy.\nThe correlation between the fields can also be calculated in another manner. It will be\nuseful to approximate things entirely in the Fraunhofer zone, i.e., with both transmitter\nand receiver in the far field, assuming Gaussian statistics. The field in the nadir case is\ngiven, in 1-D and up to a constant, by\nU =q\n\nZ\n\neiqz(x) dx.\n\n(7.1)\n\n\u2032\n\n(7.2)\n\nA\n\nNow,\n|U |2 = q 2\nh|U | i = q\n\neiq(z(x)\u2212z(x )) dxdx\u2032 ,\n\nZ Z\n\nheiq(z(x)\u2212z(x )) idxdx\u2032 .\n\nA A\n\nand\n2\n\nZ Z\n\n2\n\nA A\n\n\u2032\n\n(7.3)\n\nNow, if we assume Gaussian statistics, with\n\"\n\n#\n\nz(x)2 \u2212 2\u03c1(x \u2212 x\u2032 )z(x)z(x\u2032 ) + z 2 (x\u2032 )\n1\np\nexp\n\u2212\n,\nP (z(x) \u2212 z(x )) =\n2\u03c3 2 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ))\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2 1 \u2212 \u03c12 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n(7.4)\nwe can carry out these calculations explicitly. Here \u03c3 is the height standard deviation\nfrom the (zero) mean, and \u03c1 is the correlation function of the surface. It is healthy to\nkeep in mind that in the gaussian case, there are the only parameters, together with the\nfrequencies, that can appear in the final expressions. If we further assume a Gaussian\ncorrelation function with correlation length l, the answer to any question must be expressed\nin terms of dimensionally meaningful expressions contantaining, \u03c3, l, \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 .\nFor the case at hand, the key result is ([Beckmann et al., 1963], p. 190)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n1\nheiq1 z(x)+q2 z(x ) i = exp \u2212 \u03c3 2 (q12 + 2\u03c1(x \u2212 x\u2032 )q1 q2 + q22 ) .\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(7.5)\n\nThis implies, for instance,\nhU1 U2\u2217 i = q1 q2\n\n1\nexp \u2212 \u03c3 2 (q12 \u2212 2\u03c1(x \u2212 x\u2032 )q1 q2 + q22 ) dxdx\u2032 .\n2\nA\n\nZ Z\nA\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n39\n\n(7.6)\n\n\fIn the following we use a simple approximation,\n\u03c1(u) = 1 \u2212 |u|/l, |u| \u2264 l,\n\n(7.7)\n\nelse zero. In this simple case we model a Gaussian correlation function by a linear approximation. For simplicity we will also work in the 1-D case. The first step now is to define\nu = x \u2212 x\u2032 , and v = x + x\u2032 . The Jacobian of this change of variables is 1/2.

Imagine for instance an ocean with a very large correlation\nlength and large height standard deviation. This is mirror-like ocean with a global updown displacement. It is quite clear that ih this example hU1 U2\u2217 i will be zero, since this\nproduct will be a number in the complex plane with a reasonable magnitude and a rather\nrandom phase.

In general, the interferometric combination\naverage fields are larger. For instance, for a \u03c3\u03b6 = 79 cm simulation (50 seconds at 0.0025\ntemporal resolution, 44 m size, spatial resolution 10cm, U10=1100cmpers)-see Figure 7.4,\nthe L1, L2, L5, L12, L25 average fields were:\nL1:\nL2:\nL5:\nL12:\nL25:\n\n(+0.03, \u22120.01)\n(+0.00, \u22120.06)\n(\u22120.04, +0.03)\n(\u22120.02, +0.09)\n(\u22120.12, +0.07)\n\nwhile for U10=4 ms, \u03c3\u03b6 = 12 cm simulation, 19 m side (see Figures 6.5 , 6.6 and 6.7 for\nmore details about this simulation)\nL1:\nL2:\nL5:\nL12:\nL25:\n\n(+0.05, \u22120.03)\n(\u22120.06, \u22120.12)\n(\u22120.04, +0.10)\n(\u22120.09, +0.12)\n(\u22120.63, +0.20)\n\nThis is where the real strength of PIP becomes evident. Moreover, low-pass filtering (see\nnext section) does not change these numbers much-the average field is robust.\nThe Fraunhofer approximation has given us a useful means to understand the correlation\nproperties of the signals in different frequencies. We should note, however, that in the GPS\ncase we are not in the Fraunhofer zone-we are in the WAF zone, which is is usually\nsubstantially larger. Understanding all the implications of the extension to the WAF zone\ninvolves the analysis of the \"beast\" in Equation 7.1 which is substantially more complicated\nby the factors inthe areal function. This is left for future work.\n\n7.2\n\nFiltering\n\nAnother way to understand and take advantadge of the coherence proporties is to focus\non the low frequency aspects of the reflected signals for the static case. As we mentioned\n41\n\n\fabove, in the static situation the coherence function of the scattered phase is related to the\nzeroth Fourier component of the field-see Equation 6.1. Filtering the signal to retrieve slow\nvarying geophysical signals is thus a plausible approach. As an example, we show in Figure\n7.3 the fields with and without filtering at 0.5 Hz (relevant for the case of a LEO). The\nresult is quite good, as can be seen. This behavior is also expected from the analysis above\nof the average field above, of course. The interferometric combination is again superior,\nespecially L25 . For the satellite of aircraft case, good modeling of the receiver position and\nfiltering can be used to remove all but the slowly varying geophysical signals from the phase\ndrift.\nImportant points: filtering doesn not seem to affect the field mean value (a very desirable\nresult). It does significantly reduce the scatter, however. For instance, in Figure 7.2, we\nhave the fields for a 3 m/s wind. The standard deviations of the field go from 0.87, 0.82,\n0.79, 0.73, 0.68 to 0.51, 0.51, 0.49, 0.48, 0.29 (for L1, L2, L5, L12, L25) after 0.5 Hz filtering\nof the fields. See also the results for higher wind speed is Figures 7.3 and 7.4. The mean\nfield remains virtually unchanged after this process.\n\n42\n\n\fFigure 7.2: These are plots of the fields and phases for the case U10=3m/s (\u03c3\u03b6 = 18 cm),\nwith an ocean patch of 43 m, resolution 10 cm.

Temporal resolution in all the simulations is of 0.0025\nseconds.\n43\n\n\fFigure 7.3: These are plots of the fields and phases for the case U10=6 m/s (\u03c3\u03b6 = 42 cm),\nwith an ocean patch of 43 m, resolution 10 cm.

The top is the original time series, the\nsecond is with a field filter at 0.5 Hz. See the next figure for the corresponding (unfiltered)\ncoherence and strucuture functions. This is complete simulation, with the ocean going from\nflat to moving to flat. Observe the picked up winding number. Filtering at 0.5 Hz did not\nentirely cure the problem in this case.\n45\n\n\fChapter 8\n\nSimulation experiments with\nwinding number and GIP\nConsider the following scenario. The receiver is static. Initially the ocean is calm, totally\nflat. Then a disturbance gradually appears, peaks, and slowly disappears. The ocean final\nstate is the same as the original state: total flatness. We have run several simulations with\nthis scenario. The result is that the winding number of the field history is non-zero. That\nis, the field can loop several times arond zero.\nThe first example is in Figure 8.1 and accompanying Figure 8.2. How is this possible?\nAs can be seen in the example in Figure 8.3, the sum of zero-winding-number curves can\nresult in a winding number 1 curve. Since the resulting total field is a linear combination\nof such fields, all that we need to show is how the moving ocean can generate such winding\nnumber zero curves. This is easy: the only requirements are that a) the initial and final\nphase be the same, with the phase moving in between, and b) that the field magnitude\nincrease or decrease before returning to its original value. It is possible to imagine examples\nbased on GO reasoning (a usefull approximation, at any rate) to obtain this behaviour.\nSuppose, for instance, that the distance from a specular point to the receiver decreases and\nthen increases, while the radius of curvature decreases then increases. It is easy to see that\nthis yields a clockwise loop in phasor space (with the usual angular convention used in the\ncomplex plane).\nWe have seen the phase dispersion effect, very much related to winding number (which\nis a special case of the first when initial and final states are the same), in all wind conditions,\nwith U10=2 m/s and up. At first sight this poses a significant problem in the use of phase\nfor altimetry. How can we use a \"defiting\" measure for altimetry? It is now very important\nto characterize the statistical and geophysical properties of this phase drift (Geophysically\nInduced Phase drift, or GIP for short).\n\n8.1\n\nThe uses of winding number\n\nWinding number, or more generally, phase dispersion under a moving ocean is certainly\nrelated to sea state characteristics. An interesting Gedanken1 : imagine a satellite tracking\na reflection over a smooth region, then rough, then smooth again. The winding number\ninduced will be related to the roughness encountered. We have already seen that, in general,\n1\n\nGedanken (thought) experiments are little mental exercises for exploring hypothetical experiments. The\nterminology comes from Einstein's work, who is said to have engaged in them even when he was very young.\n\n46\n\n\fFigure 8.1: Simulation: 20 meters side, res=10cm, max ocean 4 m/s U10 with a peak \u03c3\u03b6\nof 12 cm, sine fourth modulation. Note that in the bottom row we present the FFT power\nof the normalized field. The zero component is basically the coherence function mentioned\nearlier. The interferometric component shows a higher degree of coherence.\nthe phase drifts without a specific chirality in our simulations. It remains to be seen if nongaussian effects in the surface can lead to chirality, or preferred rotation direction. If this\nis the case, this phenomenon could conceivably be used for geophysical measurements. We\nhave already seen that GIP is related to wind speed in our simulations.\n\n47\n\n\fFigure 8.2: In this Figure we illustrate the L2 field phasor in Figure 8.1, which has a\nwinding number of -1.\n\nFigure 8.3: Winding number magic: four curves with winding number 0 yield a winding\nnumber 1 curve after being added. The trick can be done with 2 curves. In this case they\nall turn in the same direction. Changing that will result in an ellipse.\n\n48\n\n\fChapter 9\n\nRecommendations for\nPost-processing Procedures\nBased on the work carried out so far, we are prepared to outline some of the possible\nincarnations of the PIP concept. What we must emphasize is that the strength lies in the\nnoise cancellation in the interferometric combination. Filtering is best carried out after this\ncombination.\n\n9.1\n\nThe PIP instrument: architecture and data products\n\nBased on our results, we have the following suggestions.\n1. Use two wideband (200 Hz for the static receiver, possibly more for the moving case)\nPLL's to extract the phase in each frequency.\n2. Combine the phases and low-pass filter to recover altimetric trends. The normalized\ninterferometric field is more coherent, so it can be used to track slow-varying altimetric\nchanges (such as a tide). We have seen that the interferometric fiels is a more robust\nsource, with a better defined phase.\n3. Use phase drift as a geophysical parameter More generally, the phase and power time\nseries are probably rich information source of sea state.\nTo be more precise, the following recipes for PIP implementation can be conceived: One,\nthe most natural one perhaps, is the Single PLL PIP (SPIP)\n1. Multiply the two signals, form the interferometric signal.\n2. Filter from 0 to 0.5 Hz\n3. Use a single PLL to extract the phase.\nThe disadvantadge is that the field magnitude will oscillate quite a bit. This may not be\nimportant, given that a filter will be used. An alternative would be to used two PLLs\n(MPIP)\n1. Extract the phase in L1 and in L2\n2. Combine the two phases\n49\n\n\f3. Filter from 0 to 0.5 Hz.\nThis is probably similar to the previous case, but it takes the field magnitude out of the\npicture from the very beginning-probably not a good thing. Finally, a non-contender is\nto\n1. Filter from 0 to 0.5 Hz\n2. Extract the phase in L1 and in L2\n3. Combine the two phases\nThis is a bad option, it makes no use of the jitter cancellation across frequencies.\nWe have focused on the static case. For other situations we just need to work with\nexcess phase and carry out the same filtering process.\n\n50\n\n\fChapter 10\n\nConclusions and Future Work\n10.1\n\nWhat we have found: PIP's superior performance\n\n1. The mean field is largest for the PIP case L25 for all sea conditions. In general the\nmean field is proportional to exp [\u2212\u03c3 2 q 2 /2], where q = 4\u03c0/\u03bb and \u03bb is the pure or\ninterferometric wavelength.\n2. The coherence integration time is consequently substantially larger for the interferometric combination, especially L25 (if the mean sea level scatter is very large the\neffect disappears, of course). The interferometric phase is coherent in a reasonable\nrange of sea conditions, unlike the single frequency phases. This implies that the PIP\ninterferometric combination is superior to extract altimetric low frequency trends in\nthe phase, as we discussed at the beginning.\n3. The phase in our simulations behaves like a random walk, and the drift rate is directly\nrelated to sea state: in general, the larger the wind speed, the higher the drift rate.\nThis implies that a system capable of tracking the phase of the reflected signals can\nprovide, aside from altimetric measurements, sea state information.\n4. Filtering the received field does not affect its mean value, while decreasing its scatter.\nIt can probably be used for altimetric purposes, as it removes noise but leaves the\nslow-varying geophysical signals alone.\n5. No long-term trends in phase drift chirality have been detected in our simulations\nwith Gaussian ocean models based on [Elfouhaily et al., 1997]. We have performed\nsimulations up to 2 minutes long. This is good news for our altimetric efforts. It seems\nthat despite the phase drift present, and the winding number it can lead to, in practice\nthis effect should not introduce systematic effects on altimetric determination. It is\nimportant to check that the simulations are correctly imitated by nature, of course.\nAmong other things, non-Gaussian effects in the sea could conceivably lead to real\ndrifting.\nThe single most important parameter in the correlation between the fields at different\nfrequencies is the significant wave height. This has to be compared to the synthetic wavelength. For rough seas, the correlation bethween the fields (and therefore interferometric\ncoherence) in different frequencies disappears, and the coherence time goes to zero even for\nthe interferometric combinations. In calmer ocean conditions, however, our results indicate\nthat the interferometric combination remains coherent.\n51\n\n\f10.2\n\nWhat we'd now like to know: future work\n\nDue to the limited scope of this study we were not able to cover all the interesting aspects\nof this problem. Future theoretical work includes the extension of the present results to the\ncase in which the receiver is far away from the ground and is moving. We would also like\nto understand the impact of changing the ocean statistics from gaussian to non-gaussian.\nAnother important aspect that deserves further research is to extend the analysis to a\nbistatic situation. So far, our simulations have only considered the monostatic case. We\nintend to continue this work within the scope of PARIS-\u03b1:\n1. Examine more realistic situations (higher, faster). This includes, in particular, understanding the issues that will arise in the aircraft and LEO scenario, and it will\nrequire larger simulations-in fact it may impossible to simulate the ocean with the\nrequired size and resolution, as the WAF zone are increases linearly with height.\n2. Understand the theoretical issues involving the correlations and Doppler spread of\nthe reflected fields without using the Fruanhofer approximation for the receiver.\n3. Extend the analysis to the bistatic situation.\n4. Carry out a detailed study of phase drift versus wind speed.\n5. Look deeper at the advantages (which we have seen and are expected) of using even\ncloser frequencies. This may result in recomendations for GALILEO, for instance.\n6. Understand the impact of non-Gaussian ocean effects.\n7. Understand better the possible sources of chirality in GID. This is important to assure\naltimetric accuracy.\n8. Obtain and analyze data for the static situation.\n9. Understand the effectiveness of GO or its higher order corrections.\nIt is rather clear that experimental work is needed in this field. The most important\nexperiment for the concept at this point, is a redo of the bridge experiment: a static\nreceiver over the moving ocean, using both L1 and L2 . The desired product from such\nan experiment from the point of view of the present work, would time-series' of the fields.\nMEATEX campaigns will also provide aircraft data which will be very useful to understand\nsome of these issues.\n\n52\n\n\fChapter 11\n\nAcknowlegments\nThis is a document produced for ESA under ESTEC Contract No. 14071/99/NL/MM.
