INTRODUCTION\nThe frontiers of astronomy have expanded through observational breakthroughs. In the recent past, one\nmajor thrust in expanding parameter envelopes was the addition of new wavelength regions. Now that\nalmost all regions are accessible, the thrust is moving towards higher spatial and temporal resolution. The\nlatter require great light-collecting powers to obtain a meaningful signal within a small fraction of a second.\nQuantEYE is designed to be the highest time-resolution instrument on OWL, the planned Overwhelmingly\nLarge Telescope of ESO, the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\f2. HIGH-SPEED ASTROPHYSICS AND QUANTUM OPTICS\nNumerous discoveries were made with resolutions of milliseconds and slower: optical and X-ray pulsars;\nplanetary-ring occultations; rotation of cometary nuclei; cataclysmic variables; pulsating white dwarfs;\nflickering high-luminosity stars; X-ray binaries; gamma-ray burst afterglows, etc. A limit for such optical\nstudies has been that CCD-like detectors do not readily permit frame-rates faster than 1 \u2013 10 ms, while\nphoton-counting detectors either had low quantum efficiency or else photon-count rates limited to no more\nthan some hundreds of kHz. Parallel to such instrumental issues lies the limitation of telescope lightcollecting power: for reasonable sensitivity there must be a photon flux to match the time resolution:\nmicroseconds require megahertz count rates.\nQuantEYE on OWL is designed for sub-nanosecond time resolutions with GHz photon count-rates to match.\nThis will enable detailed studies of phenomena such as: millisecond pulsars; variability close to black holes;\nsurface convection on white dwarfs; non-radial oscillation spectra in neutron stars; fine structure on neutronstar surfaces; photon-gas bubbles in accretion flows; and possible free-electron lasers in the magnetic fields\naround magnetars. Besides such applications in high-speed astrophysics, the aim is to reach timescales\nsufficiently short to reveal the quantum-optical statistics of photon arrival times.\n\nFigure 1. Statistics of photon arrival times in light beams with different entropies (different degrees or 'ordering'). Light may carry\nmore information than that revealed by imaging and spectroscopy: Photons from given directions with given wavelengths give the\nsame astronomical images and spectra, though the light may still differ in statistics of photon arrival times. These can be 'random',\nas in maximum-entropy black-body radiation (Bose-Einstein distribution with a certain 'bunching' in time), or may be quite different\nif the radiation deviates from thermodynamic equilibrium. (Adapted from Loudon, 2000)\n\n2.1. Ultimate Information Content of Light\nAll existing astronomical instruments that record electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength are measuring\neither the directions of photon arrival (e.g., cameras), the energy of the arriving photons (e.g.,\n\n\fspectrometers), or some combination of these properties. However, laboratory and theoretical studies in\nquantum optics have demonstrated that both individual photons and groups of photons may carry additional\ninformation, even for photons of some specific wavelength arriving from a given precise direction.\nIndividual photons may carry various amounts of orbital angular momentum (in addition to their 'regular'\nangular momentum associated with circular polarization; e.g., Harwit 2003; Padgett et al. 2004), and the\nstatistics of photon arrival times in an arriving photon stream may carry information on how the photon\nstream was created or was modified during its propagation (e.g.; Bachor 1998; Loudon 2000; Figure 1).\nCurrent astronomical instrumentation exploits properties of the spatial coherence of light (for imaging) and\nof the temporal one (for spectroscopy). Beyond this first-order coherence, higher-order coherences of light\nmay in principle convey information about the physics of light emission (e.g., stimulated emission as in a\nlaser) or propagation (e.g., whether photons reach us directly from the source, or have undergone scattering\non their way); Dravins 1994. In the laboratory, such properties of light have now been studied for some\ntime, but have not yet been applied in astrophysics. Such higher-order coherence of light can be measured\nfrom the arrival-time statistics of individual photons, with the effects fully visible over timescales equal to\nthe [first-order] temporal coherence time. For astronomically realistic passbands (1 nm, say), this is on the\norder of picoseconds, much shorter than realistic photometric resolutions. On the more realistic nanosecond\nscales, the effects are diluted but still measurable, as demonstrated already years ago by the intensity\ninterferometer, the [so far] only astronomical instrument that studied the second-order coherence of light\n(e.g., Hanbury Brown 1974).\nUsing concepts related to this [spatial] intensity interferometer, analogous 'interferometry' in the time\ndomain ('photon-correlation spectroscopy', also used in many laboratory experiments; e.g., Pike 1974) will\nreach a spectral resolution \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u2248 100,000,000, as required to resolve known optical laser emission around\nthe luminous object Eta Carinae. Theoretically expected emission linewidths there are on the order \u2206\u03bd \u2248 10\nMHz (Johansson & Letokhov 2004; 2005), which can be resolved by photon-correlation spectroscopy with\ndelay times \u2206t \u2248 100 ns. However, analogous to spatial information from intensity interferometry, photon\ncorrelation spectroscopy does not reconstruct the full shape of the source spectrum, but \"only\" gives\nlinewidth information.\n\n3. THE NEED FOR EXTREMELY LARGE TELESCOPES\nThe largest optical telescopes offer enormously increased sensitivity for studying astrophysical variability on\ntimescales of milli-, micro-, and nanoseconds. Since the astrophysical phenomena are normally not periodic,\nand their exact timescales are both unknown and variable, studies must be of photon-stream statistics, e.g.,\npower spectra or autocorrelations. Such functions increase with the square of the collected light intensity:\ndoubling the telescope diameter increases the area fourfold, and the signal by a factor of 16! Higher-order\ncorrelations increase even steeper with telescope size.\nThe enormously increased sensitivity offered by ELT's in observing very rapid variability and photon\nstatistics in astronomical sources, may well open up quantum optics as a fundamentally new information\nchannel from the Universe. QuantEYE is being designed to meet that challenge, and to venture into\npreviously unexplored parameter domains.\n\n\fTable 1. Light-curves become useless for resolutions below microseconds where typical time intervals between successive photons\nmay even be longer than the time resolution. Instead studies have to be of the statistics of the arriving photon stream, such as its\ncorrelations or power spectra. All such statistical functions depend on [at least] the second power of the source intensity. The table\ncompares the observed signal (I), its square and fourth powers, for telescopes of different size. The signal for classical quantities\nincreases with the intensity I; the signal in power spectra as I2; and that of four-photon correlations as I4. This very steep dependence\nmakes the largest telescopes enormously more sensitive for high-speed astrophysics and quantum optics.\n\n4. QuantEYE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN\nTo study timescales down to nanoseconds, there is the corresponding need to count photons at sustained\nrates up to some GHz. The requirement of a high quantum efficiency leads to single-photon counting\navalanche diodes (SPAD's) as the detectors of choice, although \u2013 at least at present \u2013 there appears not to\nexist any single detector that can handle such count rates, why we are led towards a concept of a detector\narray, over which the light from the source is distributed. A further technical limit is set by the \u2013 at least at\npresent \u2013 small physical size (of order 100 \u03bcm) of the detector elements, which somewhat complicates the\noptical interface at large telescopes.\nFor the first conceptual design, a 'conservative' approach was taken, designing the system within existing\ndetector technologies. Besides demonstrating the feasibility of concept, this means that a prototype or test\ninstrument could be constructed along these lines, using commercially available components.\nThe optical design uses pupil-slicing, optically subdividing the OWL 100-meter entrance pupil into one\nhundred 10-meter segments. Light from these 100 pupil segments is then focused onto a fast (f/1) lenslet\narray with 100 lenses, feeding an array of 100 SPAD's through optical fibers. Each detector can sustain\nphoton-count rates of up to some 10 MHz, so that their combined output may reach 1 GHz. Although, after\nphoton detection, each detector has a deadtime of maybe 50 ns, the timing of each photon can be made with\nsubnanosecond precision, as can the correlation between photon arrivals in different detectors. An exact\ndifferential timetag is assigned by a hydrogen maser clock (or future optical clock), and a GPS (or future\nGalileo) satellite receiver system provides an absolute time reference, enabling coordinated observations\nwith other instruments on the ground or in space. A second detector head allows calibration and reference\nmeasurements.\n\n\fBesides enabling GHz count rates, the segmented-pupil design has advantages in that (a) The detector\nredundancy enables to confirm possibly doubtful signals through their possible simultaneous occurrence in\ndifferent channels; (b) Some types of events imply an illumination sweeping across the entrance pupil (e.g.\noccultations by Kuiper-belt asteroids), which now can be both spatially and temporally resolved; and (c) By\nsuitable cross-correlations of the detected signal, a digital Hanbury Brown-Twiss intensity interferometer is\nrealized between a large number of different sub-apertures across the full OWL pupil.\nThe QuantEYE wavelength range is set by that of its photon-counting SPAD's. The silicon-based ones cover\nthe optical from 400 \u2013 1000 nm, while for the near infrared (1.0 \u2013 1.8 \u03bcm), SPAD's based on germanium and\nsimilar materials are being developed in industry. Such already exist, although their rather high dark-count\nrates do not yet make them suitable for our applications.\nRaw data rates of 100 \u2013 1000 Mb/s will be highly compressed in real time by on-line digital signal\nprocessors outputting only various statistical functions. Thanks to the pupil-slicing concept, QuantEYE will\nbe able to work also with a partially filled OWL pupil, and (assuming the source is kept within the 1 arcsec\naperture) will function well also without [full] adaptive optics.\nFigure 2 outlines the optical solution for this conceptual design; for more details see Dravins et al. (2005):\n\nCollimator\n\n10\u00d710 distributed array\nof 50 \u03bcm SPAD's\n\nf/6\n\n...\n\n...\n\nOWL focus\nFilters and\npolarizers\n\n10\u00d710 f/1\nlenslet array\n\nFigure 2. Sketch of the optical concept for QuantEYE: distributed detector array, and segmented aperture. The collimator-lens\nsystem magnifies 1/60 times (collimator focal length = 600 mm, lens focal length = 10 mm), giving a nominal spot size of 50 mm for\na 1-arcsec source.\n\n\f5. FUTURE DESIGN CHALLENGES\nRemoving the constraint to design the instrument with currenty available components, one may speculate\nwhat technology might eventually become available in the OWL construction timeframe.\nThe perhaps main limitation of the present design is that it only permits observations of one point source at a\ntime. Of importance would be the availability of two-dimensional photon-detector arrays of high quantum\nefficiency, in which each pixel could sustain very high count rates (and ideally even have an\nenergy/wavelength resolution). Such arrays are actively being developed, and if/when their performance\nreaches satisfactory levels, these should enable an imaging system with nanosecond resolution. For\nexample, one could then observe a globular cluster containing an active X-ray source of unknown location,\nand then search for an optically rapidly variable object somewhere in the field.\nThe data rates could become quite significant. If an imaging system with one megapixel, say, becomes\navailable, and if each pixel is photon-counting at 10 MHz, say, this generates 1012 time-tags per second, and\npetabytes of data already in a short time, stressing the need for efficient real-time data reduction, presumably\noutputting only the relevant statistical functions from each pixel, with a further on-line selection of the most\n'interesting' pixels. In some sense, such a data 'filtering' is reminiscent of that being designed for highenergy accelerator experiments with analogous very large data flows.\n\n6. INSTRUMENTATION PHYSICS\nTo eventually obtain high accuracies in astrophysical observations, a number of instrumental and\nobservational issues may need to be understood. Here we exemplify some of them that merit further study:\n* Temporal structure of the sky background? The night sky is not constant, and has contributions from, e.g.,\nnanosecond-duration flashes of Cherenkov light induced by high-energy gamma rays (otherwise being\nstudied by large light collectors), or faint but numerous meteors.\n* Atmospheric intensity scintillation? Although, to a first approximation, the large OWL aperture averages\nout scintillation effects, contributions come due to the incompletely filled entrance pupil. The narrow\ninterspaces between the mirror segments will extract the spatially smaller and temporally faster fluctuations\n(in addition being sensitive not only to scintillation amplitude, but also to the atmospheric wind direction,\nsince the spaces between the hexagonal mirrors have only a few preferred directions; Dravins et al. 1998).\n* Temporal structure of stray light? Some scattered light is always present, but normally it is not an issue\nwhether it reaches the focal plane some nanoseconds sooner or later. However, if observing a sudden burst\nfrom a source, and if its light is scattered off some telescope structure, that scattered light may arrive to the\ndetector with a systematic timelag relative to the main burst, possibly mimicking an afterpulse or a precursor\n(the speed of light is 30 cm per nanosecond).\n* Intensity fluctuations by adaptive optics? The accurate photometry of [constant] objects across adaptiveoptics corrected fields of view is being discussed in the literature. Any rapidly moving adaptive mirror will\nlikely modulate the intensity of the source observed (at least changing some of the intensity fluctuations\ncaused by the atmosphere). Since the adaptive-optics correction varies across the field, a calibration source\nelsewhere will probably not undergo the same modulation.\n\n\f* Microphysics of photon detection? Contrary to common language usage, photons as such are never\ndirectly detected \u2013 rather one studies photo-electrons that result from the photon interaction inside the\ndetector. Photons, having integer quantum spin, are bosons and follow Bose-Einstein statistics which is very\n'permissive' in allowing them to 'bunch' together in time. Electrons, however, having half-integer spin, are\nfermions, follow Fermi-Dirac statistics, and obey the Pauli exclusion principle that prohibits any 'bunching'\nin the same quantum state. One may then wonder how it is possible to study boson properties through a\nmedium (electrons) that cannot, not even in principle, carry such properties? For photocathode detectors, the\nexplanation apparently is the very short time (femtoseconds?) required for a photoelectron to exit a\nphotocathode and then be detected as an individual particle. However, semiconductor detectors may be\nmore complex, and have longer timescales for the relaxation of their inner energy levels.\n* Quantum statistics changes inside the instrument? Photon statistics may be affected by many factors,\nincluding the re-direction of light, for example through a beamsplitter. While in the classical case, a\nbeamsplitter would split the amplitude of a light wave as 50-50%, say; in the quantum case the beamsplitter\nis 'cleaving' the photon gas with all its photon correlations into two parts whose statistics, i.e. the amount of\nphoton bunching in time, is changed after passage of the beamsplitter (e.g., Bachor 1998). On one hand, this\nillustrates how photon statistics is carrying information beyond the classical case, but it also demonstrates the\nneed to understand the quantum behavior of the {telescope + instrument}-system: in the quantum world the\nobserver may not be separable from what is being observed.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe work in Lund was supported by the Swedish Research Council, the Royal Physiographical Society in\nLund, and the European Southern Observatory.
