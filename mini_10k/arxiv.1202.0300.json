INTRODUCTION\n\nThe remarkable discovery of extrasolar planets orbiting sun-like stars in 1995 was accomplished by utilizing\nnovel techniques that improved the radial velocity (RV)\nprecision by two orders of magnitude (from \u223c1 km/s to\n10 m/s), which was at last sufficient to search for the\nslight gravitational wobble induced by an orbiting gas giant planet upon its host star (Walker et al. 1995; Mayor\n& Queloz 1995; Marcy & Butler 1996; Cochran et al.\n1997; but cf. Latham et al. 1989). Since then an extensive international effort has begun to determine the ubiquity and basic properties of these initially elusive objects.\nBased on a modest extrapolation of current findings, we\nnow know that roughly 12% of Sun-like stars (F,G, and K\nspectral type) harbor gas giant planets within 30 AU (e.g.\nButler et al. 2006; Udry et al. 2007; Cumming et al.\n2008; Wright et al. 2010; Howard et al. 2010). While\nthe masses of these planets are similar to the gas giants in our solar system (i.e. Jupiter and Saturn), their\norbital properties are in many ways radically different.\nSome orbit their host star in just a few days time (the\n\"hot Jupiters\"), while others have highly eccentric orbits.\nPlanet-like companions have even been directly imaged\nat separations of more than 100 AU from their host star\n(Kalas et al. 2008).\nThe dramatically different properties of extrasolar\nplanets compared to those in our solar system forced theorists to reconsider the standard paradigm for gas giant\nplanet formation. Now, planet formation scenarios generally fall into 2 categories, core accretion (Mizuno et al.\n1980) and disk instabilities (Boss 1997). Core accretion is the favored mechanism for producing giant planets with large core masses (e.g. Sato et al. 2005) and\ncan naturally explain the enhanced frequency of planets around metal rich stars (e.g. Robinson et al. 2006).\nHowever, at wide separations (& 10 AU) the timescale for\nplanet formation via core accretion (Pollack et al. 1996;\nAlibert et al. 2005) is longer than the typical disk dissipation timescale (. 10 Myr; Haisch 2001; Brice\u00f1o et al.\n2001; Carpenter et al. 2006; Pascucci et al. 2006); it\nis thus an unlikely formation mechanism for the planets in very wide orbits about Fomalhaut and HR 8799\n(Marois et al. 2008; Kalas et al. 2008). Disk instabilities, on the other hand, can form planets much\nmore quickly (. 1 Myr), well before circumstellar disks\nare dispersed (Boss 1997, 2004; Mayer et al. 2002;\nMeru & Bate 2010, but cf. Stamatellos & Whitworth\n2008; Meru & Bate 2011). This mechanism also works\nnearly as efficiently around low mass stars, with sufficiently massive disks, and seems a more plausible scenario for forming the known massive planets orbiting M\ndwarfs (Boss 2006). Of course, it is possible that both\nscenarios operate or dominate within different regimes of\nstellar and/or disk mass.\nIn addition to the uncertainties surrounding planet\nformation, it is also unclear how the orbits of newly\nformed planets dynamically evolve. Since giant planets are believed to form beyond the snowline (e.g.\nKennedy & Kenyon 2008), inward orbital migration\nmust occur in many systems to explain the wealth of\nshort period planets; roughly 10% of gas giant planets have separations less than 0.1 AU (Butler et al.\n2006). Interactions with disk material is widely be-\n\nlieved to be the most efficient mechanism for inward\nmigration (e.g. Goldreich & Tremaine 1980; Lin et al.\n1996). If most gas giants migrate via this process,\nthe hot Jupiters must become 'hot' within \u223c 10\nMyr after formation, prior to disk dissipation. However, planet-disk interactions typically circularize orbits\nand maintain spin-orbit alignment with the star, so\nother processes such as dynamical scattering with other\nplanets (Adams & Laughlin 2003; Raymond et al.\n2011) or a nearby star (Malmberg et al. 2007;\nMalmberg & Davies 2009) may be needed to produce\nthe broad extrasolar planet eccentricity distribution and\nthe spin-orbit misaglignments of many transiting planets\n(e.g. Pont et al. 2009). These dynamical interactions\ncould take many hundreds of millions of years (e.g. see\nreview by Lubow & Ida 2010).\nOne direct way to begin constraining the mechanisms and timescales of planet formation and migration is to search for planets around stars with ages\nof . 10 Myr, or essentially immediately after planets\ncould have formed. Direct imaging searches for planets have been more successful at this recently than\nRV searches. Several massive Jupiter-like companions\nhave been directly imaged around stars with these ages,\nthough at somewhat wide separations (10 to many\n100s of AU; e.g. Neuh\u00e4user et al. 2005; Lagrange et al.\n2010; Ireland et al. 2011); these important discoveries are helping to motivate future high-contrast imaging facilities and the science achievable with them (e.g.\nMacintosh et al. 2008; Kataria & Simon 2010). In\nmany cases, however, planetary status relies upon comparisons with poorly tested evolutionary models, and the\nwide separations offer little constraint on the migration\nmechanism responsible for forming hot Jupiter-like planets.\nPlanets identified via RV variations, on the other hand,\nyield immediate mass lower limits (msini) and preferentially find massive short-period planets which most\nlikely have migrated. However, two universal properties of young stars inhibit measuring their RV precisely\nat optical wavelengths, and consequently they are often\nexcluded in high precision RV surveys for planets. The\nfirst of these is that young Sun-like stars are much cooler\nwhile young, and thus fainter at optical wavelengths.\nA 1 solar mass star, for example, has a spectral type\nof \u223c K5 at 10 Myr (Baraffe et al. 1998; Siess et al.\n2000). This, coupled with the fact that all star forming regions are further away than 100 pc means that\nmost young stars are simply too faint for high-precision\nRV work at optical wavelengths. The second of these\nis that young stars are often modestly to rapidly rotating. This rotation broadens stellar absorption features\nand, even more perniciously, generates chromospheric\nactivity and a spotted stellar surface. Several pioneering RV studies of young spotted stars have shown that\ntheir presence can induce low amplitude, periodic RV\nshifts, and thus mimic the effect of one or more orbiting planets (Queloz et al. 2001; Paulson & Yelda 2006;\nHuerta et al. 2008; Prato et al. 2008; Reiners et al.\n2010; Crockett et al. 2011; Mahmud et al. 2011); amplitudes of 200 - 700 m/s have been observed. In\na couple cases, Jupiter-like companions have been reported orbiting young stars based on low-amplitude\n(< 1 km/s) RV variations (Setiawan et al. 2008;\n\n\fThe Search for Young Planets\nHern\u00e1n-Obispo et al. 2010), but subsequent observations indicate that these too were misidentifications caused by star spots (Hu\u00e9lamo et al. 2008;\nFigueira et al. 2010).\nOne promising way to overcome these observational\nchallenges is to observe at infrared wavelengths. As has\nbeen demonstrated, modern infrared spectrographs utilizing molecular gas cells are able to obtain RV precisions comparable to very stable optical facilities (e.g.\nBean et al. 2010). This wavelength range is advantageous for young stars on cool convective tracks since\nit is much closer to the peak of their energy distribution, thereby improving observing efficiency. More significantly, at these wavelengths the contrast between the\nphotosphere and cool star spots is reduced; this is confirmed by the decline in the photometric variability of\nspotted stars with wavelength (e.g. Herbst et al. 1994).\nSince the RV \"noise\" induced by star spots is directly\nproportional to the amplitude of a star's photometric\nvariability (Saar & Donahue 1997), the diminished variability at longer wavelength observations should help\nmitigate the noise of star spots. Observations of young\nspotted stars at both optical and infrared wavelenghts\nappear to confirm this prediction (Prato et al. 2008;\nHu\u00e9lamo et al. 2008; Mahmud et al. 2011).\nMotivated by the prospects for obtaining highprecision RV measurements of young stars at infrared\nwavelengths, in late 2004 we began an ambitious observational program at the W. M. Keck Observatory (PI: R.\nWhite) to search for young planets. Here we present initial results. In Section 2 we describe the sample selection\nand in Section 3 we summarize the acquisition of infrared\nspectra. In Sections 4 and 5 we describe our method for\noptimally extracting the spectra and for modeling the\nspectra to determine precise RVs. The results of this\nsurvey, which include the discovery of two spectroscopic\nbinaries and one candidate hot Jupiter, are highlighted\nin Section 6. In Section 7 we determine detection limits\nfor the ensemble sample via Monte Carlo simulations and\nquantify the advantage infrared RVs measurements have\nover optical measurements for young stars. Our overall\nfindings are summarized in Section 8.\n2. THE OBSERVATIONAL SAMPLE: YOUNG STARS AND\nCOMPARISON FIELD STARS\n\nAlthough our entire young star survey includes stars\nfrom both star forming regions and nearby loose associations, in this first paper we focus only on young stars in\nthe \u03b2 Pic and TW Hydrae Associations, which have ages\nof \u223c 12 Myr and \u223c 8 Myr, respectively (Torres et al.\n2008). The high quality spectra of these nearby, systematically brighter stars were our initial focus as we developed techniques for precise RV measurements. The selection criteria for targets within these associations were\nthat the star have no known companions within 2.\u2032\u2032 0, be\nsomewhat slowly rotating (vsini . 15 km/s, if known),\nshow no signs of accretion (e.g. TW Hya itself was excluded), and have an M spectral type. The spectral\ntype criterion was adopted to ensure that that stars have\nstrong 12 CO R-branch lines in their spectra, from which\nRVs are measured. Stars were selected from the membership lists assembled in Zuckerman & Song (2004); 9\nstars from the \u03b2 Pic Association and 9 stars from the TW\nHydrae Association met these criteria. Wide companions\n\n3\n\nto 2 of these stars have spectral types just slightly earlier\nthan M, AG Tri A (K6) and TWA 9A (K5), and were\ntherefore also included since their acquisition overhead\nwould be minimal. Spectroscopic observations of a few\nof these stars (GJ 871.1 B, TWA 12, TWA 23) revealed\nthat they were more rapidly rotating than our initial selection criterion. We nevertheless continued to observe\nthese stars in order to investigate empirically how the\nprecision degrades with projected rotational velocity.\nAfter our observational program began, one of our\ntargets, GJ3305, was discovered to be a 0.\u2032\u2032 093 binary\n(Kasper et al. 2007), making it a triple star system\n(Feigelson et al. 2006). It was consequently observed\nless often as it was considered a less likely planet host.\nWe also note that of the 20 young stars in this sample, 14\nof them (70%) are members of wide binary star systems,\nwith separations ranging from 29 to 1967 AU. These include AG Tri A and B, GJ 799 A and B, GJ 871.1 A and\nB, GJ3305, TWA 8A and 8B, TWA 9A and 9B, TWA\n11B, TWA 13A and 13B.\nIn addition to these 20 young stars, we also included\nin our sample the well studied single M dwarf flare\nstar GJ 873 (EV Lac). GJ 873 is the second brightest M dwarf X-ray source in the R\u00f6ntgensatellit AllSky Survey (H\u00fcnsch et al. 1999; Osten et al. 2006),\nhas one of the strongest surface magnetic field strengths\nmeasured on an M dwarf (Johns-Krull & Valenti 1996;\nReiners & Basri 2007), and a differential star spot covering factor of 4-11% (Abranin et al. 1998). While its activity suggests a young age, its dwarf-like gravity and the\nabsence of lithium in its atmosphere (Pettersen et al.\n1984) indicate it is not pre-main sequence. It's usually\nclassified as a young disk star (e.g. Osten et al. 2006)\nwith an approximate age of 108 yr. The motivation for\nincluding this star was to assess the achievable RV precision at infrared wavelengths in the limit of extreme\nsurface activity.\nFor calibration purposes we observed a handful of A\nspectral type stars during each observing run. The telluric absorption features superimposed upon these nearly\nfeatureless stellar spectra, at infrared wavelengths, are\nused to characterize the instrumental profile. In addition, we observed 3 mid-M dwarf stars (GJ 628, GJ725A\nand GJ725B) that have been previously monitored with\nhigh precision optical RV techniques and shown to\nhave no detectable RV companions (Nidever et al. 2002;\nEndl et al. 2006); Endl et al. (2006) measure RV dispersions of 7.4 m/s and 7.1 m/s for GJ 725A and GJ 725\nB, respectively. These stars were included to assess the\nachievable RV precision in the limit of slowly rotating,\ninactive stars.\nStellar masses for the young stars are estimated by\ncomparing their stellar temperatures to a theoretical\nisochrone. To do this we assembled stellar spectral\ntypes from original references (see Table 1) and assigned\ntemperatures using the T Tauri-like temperature scale\nof Luhman (2003) for stars cooler than M0, and the\ndwarf temperature scale of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007)\nfor hotter stars. These temperatures are then compared to the 10 Myr isochrone of Baraffe et al. (1998)\nwith a mixing length of 1.9 above 0.6 M\u2299 and a mixing length of 1.0 at lower masses; this evolutionary\nmodel with the adopted temperature scale is consis-\n\n\f4\n\nBailey et al.\nTable 1\nObserved Sample\nStar\nName\n\nSpT\n\nReference\n\nK\n(mag)\n\nGJ 628\nGJ 725A\nGJ 725A\n\nM3.5\nM3\nM3.5\n\nH94\nH94\nH94\n\n5.07\n4.43\n5.00\n\nGJ 873\n\nM3.5\n\nH94\n\n5.30\n\nAU Mic\nAG Tri A\nAG Tri B\nGJ 182\nGJ 3305\nGJ 799 A\nGJ 799 B\nGJ 871.1 A\nGJ 871.1 B\nHIP 12545\n\nM0\nK6\nM0\nM0\nM0.5\nM4.5\nM4\nM4\nM4.5\nM0\n\nH96\nS03\nS03\nH96\nH96\nH96\nH96\nS02\nS02\nS03\n\n4.53\n7.08\n7.92\n6.26\n6.41\n5.69\n5.69\n6.93\n7.79\n7.07\n\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\nTWA\n\nM1\nM2\nM5\nK5\nM1\nM2.5\nM2\nM1\nM2\nM1\n\nW99\nW99\nW99\nW99\nW99\nW99\nS99\nS99\nS99\nS03\n\n6.90\n7.43\n9.01\n7.85\n9.15\n8.35\n8.05\n7.49\n7.46\n7.75\n\nMass\n(M\u2299 )\n\nPeriod\n(days)\n\nReference\n\nvsini\n(km/s)\n\nReference\n\n***\n***\n***\n\n< 1.1\n< 2.8\n< 2.8\n\nD98\nD98\nD98\n\nSingle Field Stars\n0.30\n0.37\n0.30\n\n***\n***\n***\n\nChromospherically Active Field Stars\n0.30\n\n4.38\n\nM95\n\n***\n\n***\n\n4.87\n13.7\n***\n4.56\n6.10\n***\n***\n2.355\n***\n1.25\n\nM95\nN07\n***\nM95\nF06\n***\n***\nM10\n***\nM10\n\n8.5\n***\n***\n***\n5.3\n10.6\n17.0\n14.0\n24.3\n9.3\n\nS07\n***\n***\n***\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\n\nLC05\nLC05\nLC05\nLC05\nLC05\n***\nLC05\nLC05\nLC05\n***\n\n<5\n<5\n11.2\n11.3\n8.4\n12.1\n16.2\n10.5\n14.8\n***\n\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\nS07\n***\n\n\u03b2 Pic Stars\n0.73\n0.94\n0.73\n0.73\n0.67\n0.16\n0.22\n0.22\n0.16\n0.73\n\nTW Hya Stars\n7\n8A\n8B\n9A\n9B\n11B\n12\n13A\n13B\n23\n\n0.60\n0.51\n0.12\n1.01\n0.60\n0.44\n0.51\n0.60\n0.51\n0.60\n\n5.05\n4.65\n0.78\n5.10\n3.98\n***\n3.28\n5.56\n5.35\n***\n\nNote. - References: D98 = Delfosse et al.

This yields stellar masses that range from\n0.12 M\u2299 to 1.01 M\u2299 , with a median mass of 0.6\nM\u2299 . Approximate masses for the field dwarfs are estimated from the absolute magnitude - mass relations of\nHenry & McCarthy (1993), where the absolute magnitudes have been assigned based on spectral type relations\ngiven in Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007).\nTable 1 summarizes the basic properties of the sample observed, excluding the A spectral type stars. The\nlisted properties include spectral types, K magnitudes,\nmass estimates, rotational periods, if known, previously\nreported vsini values, if available, and the corresponding references. The K magnitudes for the field stars are\ntaken from Leggett (1992) whereas the values for Association members are from the 2MASS survey, and thus\nare Ks magnitudes. Since the 2MASS survey reports\nonly a combined magnitude for GJ799AB, a 2.\u2032\u2032 8 pair, we\nestimate each component's magnitude by assuming they\nare equally bright; the components of this binary have\nthe same spectral type.\n3. HIGH DISPERSION INFRARED SPECTRA\n\nSpectroscopic observations of the sample stars were obtained using the cross-dispersed infrared echelle spectro-\n\ngraph NIRSPEC (McLean et al. 1998) on the W. M.\nKeck II telescope. The observations were obtained over\n12 observing runs in total, spanning from 2004 Nov 16\nto 2009 May 12. The large number of runs was a consequence of this program being completed in concert with a\nsimilar program focused on L dwarfs (Blake et al. 2007,\n2010).\nAll observations were obtained with the 3 pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 432)\nslit in combination with the N7 blocking filter, and approximate echelle angle 62.65 and grating angle 35.50.\nThis yielded 7 orders of spectra spanning approximately\n1.99 \u03bcm to 2.39 \u03bcm, with gaps between the orders, at\na resolving power of approximately 30,000 (measured as\ndescribed below). The spectra were obtained in pairs\nat two locations along the slit. Collecting observations\nin this manner provided a nearly simultaneous measurement of sky emission and detector bias for both images.\nSince the measurement goal of this program was precise RVs, considerable effort was put into maintaining\ninstrument stability by not moving any internal components of NIRSPEC while observing. However, when the\nNIRSPEC software is first started (at the beginning of\na night) or when a software crash occurs, the motors for\nthe filter wheels and reflection angles must all be reinitialized, forcing the internal components to move. Since re-\n\n\f5\n\nThe Search for Young Planets\nsetting the reflection angles typically results in a slightly\ndifferent setting, these values were tweaked slightly, by\neye, to return to the primary wavelength setting; this\nprocedure resulted in the same wavelength coverage to\nwithin a few pixels. Since the spectroscopic properties of\nthis new setting would be slightly different, we strived to\ncharacterize each 'observational set' by intensively observing one of the A spectral type stars for each NIRSPEC setting. We were successful in this effort for all\nbut one 'observational set'.\n4. IMAGE REDUCTION AND SPECTRAL EXTRACTION\n\nFor each observational set, described above, dark images were median combined and this median was subtracted from each flat-field image. These subtracted flatfield images were then normalized by counts in the central \u223c 10% of the array, and then median combined to\ngenerate a master flat. Regions outside the illuminated\n7 orders were set to unity. The orders were not normalized in the direction of dispersion, a necessary step\nto strictly preserve the counts and the correct relative\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR); skipping this led to fringing\neffects that were more consistent, smaller in amplitude,\nand easier to remove (see below). All spectrum images\nwere then divided by the master flat constructed for its\nobservational set, and then each flattened image had its\ncorresponding nod image subtracted from it to remove\nthe sky emission, detector bias and dark current. This\nyielded 2 reduced spectrum images for each epoch.\nPrior to spectral extraction, the 7 spectral orders were\nlocated on the reduced spectrum image automatically by\nfinding maxima in smoothed spatial profiles of each order\n(i.e. perpendicular to the dispersion direction). Gaussian\nfunctions were then fit to these spatial profiles in binned\nsegments of 10-columns along the orders. The orders\nwere then traced by fitting a low order polynomial to the\npeak position of these Gaussians, with 3\u03c3 outliers excluded from the fit. Next, regions that were more than 3\nsigma above or below the best fit polynomial defining the\ncenter of each order were masked and excluded from any\nfurther analysis. Masking the orders in this way objectively accounted for variations in the spatial width of the\nspectra, usually caused by variations in the seeing, and\nproved vital for successful extraction of pair subtracted\nspectra only 10.\u2032\u2032 0 apart.\nSpectra were extracted from the masked images using\na modified version of the 'optimal extraction' procedure\ndescribed in Horne et al. (1986). Unlike standard extraction techniques which simply sum pixel values over a\nspecified range, optimal extraction sums pixels weighted\nby the variance of an assumed smoothly varying spatial profile that can be defined either perpendicular to\nor parallel to the dispersion direction. This minimizes\nthe noisy contributions of profile wings and allows significant deviates from the profile (e.g. hot pixels and cosmic\nrays) to be easily identified and removed (see Piskunov &\nValenti 2002 for this and other issues related to the optimal extraction of cross-dispersed echelle spectra). After\nconsiderable experimentation, we adopted spatial profiles defined parallel to the dispersion direction and used\na Gaussian plus second order polynomial to model these.\nThe variance of the profile was determined from each\npair subtracted flat-fielded spectrum image. We note\nthat this is slightly different from the recommendation of\n\nHorne et al. (1986) to use a bias subtracted flat-fielded\nspectrum image; as with most infrared observations, the\nbias is only removed as a part of pair subtraction. The\naddition of these bias counts produced slightly larger\nvariance estimates, but this yielded no noticeable effect\non our relatively high SNR spectra. Future studies may\nconsider obtaining bias images throughout the night in\nan attempt to determine a more accurate variance image.\nAn example of an optimally extracted spectrum is\nshown in Figure 1. One feature not accounted for in\nthese extractions is interference fringing. Although some\ninvestigators have developed prescriptions to remove this\nvia Fourier filtering (Deming et al. 2005), we accounted\nfor this feature in the spectral modeling process.\n5. MODELING THE SPECTRA AND PRECISE RADIAL\nVELOCITY MEASUREMENTS\n\n5.1. Assumptions\n\nPrecise RVs were extracted from the observations by\nconstructing a detailed model of each spectrum. Although a wide variety of modeling prescriptions were investigated with our data to optimize this, the prescription described here is the one that yielded the most consistent RVs for 15+ epochs of 3 slowly rotating M dwarfs\nwith no known planets (GJ 628, GJ725A and GJ725B).\nThe modeled spectra were constructed from an ultrahigh resolution KPNO/FTS telluric spectrum, extracted\nfrom observations of the Sun (Livingston & Wallace\n1991), and synthetically generated stellar spectra, computed from updated and improved NextGen models\n(Hauschildt et al. 1999), constructed and provided by\ncoauthor T. Barman. Although the 12 CO bandhead and\nR branch lines are temperature and surface gravity dependent, we did not determine these parameters from\nour spectra; attempts to do this yielded results that were\nonly marginally consistent with previous values considered to be more accurate (e.g. from optical spectra). Instead, we used a synthetically generated spectrum that\nmost closely matched each star's spectral type and expected surface gravity. All field stars (GJ 628, GJ725A,\nGJ725B, GJ 873) were assumed to have a log(g) = 4.8\ndex, while the young stars were assumed to have a log(g)\n= 4.2 dex, consistent with recent log(g) measurements\n(Mentuch et al. 2008). The stellar properties of the\nspectral templates used for each star are listed in Table\n2.\nEach observation was modeled by combining a telluric\nand a synthetic spectrum, parametrized by 10 free parameters. Four parameters determine instrumental properties - the wavelength solution was parametrized by a\nquadratic polynomial, characteristic of slightly curved\nspectral orders, and the instrumental spectral profile was\nmodeled as a single best-fit Gaussian for the entire order. The remaining six parameters characterize the spectral properties, including the depth of telluric features,\nthe depth of stellar features, the star's projected rotational velocity (vsini), a linear (2 parameter) continuum normalization offset, and finally, the star's RV. The\nlimb darkening coefficient used to calculate rotationally\nbroadened profiles, which was not considered a free parameter in these calculations, was held fixed at 0.6 in all\ncases.\n5.2. Implementation\n\n\f6\n\nBailey et al.\n\nOnly 1 of the 7 orders acquired (NIRSPEC order #33)\nwas modeled; this is one of the few wavelength regions\nwhich has a sufficiently rich array of both the stellar and\ntelluric absorption features, permitting precise RV calibration. The usable region of the observed order spans\napproximately 270 \u00c5, from 2.288 \u03bcm to 3.315 \u03bcm (Figure\n1).\nThe spectral modeling proceeded in essentially 3\nstages. First, the A-type star spectra were modeled to\nconstruct initial estimates of the wavelength solution and\ninstrumental profile for each observational set. Since the\nspectra of A type stars are essentially featureless over\nthis wavelength range, their spectra were modeled as\nsimple telluric spectra, and 3 of the 10 parameters of\nthe general fit were omitted (stellar absorption depth,\nvsini, and RV). The best fit was determined by subtracting the model spectrum from the observed spectrum and applying a Hamming filter to this difference\nto remove the residual fringing pattern. Optimization\nwas achieved by an iterative process that minimized the\nvariance-weighted reduced \u03c72 of these filtered residuals,\nusing the prescription described below. Parameters determined for multiple A star observations within a set\nwere averaged, weighted by their \u03c72 values, to determine\nthe best \"first guess\" values for that set.\nThe average best fit instrumental profile determined\nfrom the best fit models of the A star spectra corresponded to a resolving power of \u223c 30,000, with a dispersion of \u223c 2, 000. This is larger than expected for this\ninstrumental setup, which is predicted to yield resolving\npowers of \u223c 25, 000 (McLean et al. 1998). Although we\nare unsure of the discrepancy, it may be attributable to\nthe excellent seeing at Mauna Kea and starlight not fully\nfilling the 0.\u2032\u2032 432 slit.\nEach late-type stellar spectrum was modeled by adopting and holding fixed its set's estimates of the linear and\nquadratic terms of the wavelength solution. All other\nparameters were determined via an iterative fitting process, but at all times the parameters were nevertheless\nrestricted to realistic ranges. In the first iteration the\n0th order component of the wavelength solution was optimized by allowing it to vary; the parameter describing\nthe instrument profile was adopted from its set's estimate. The second iteration optimized the instrument\nprofile by allowing it to vary. The third iteration was\nused to determine the stellar vsini by allowing it to vary.\nOnce complete, a chi-square weighted mean of the bestfit vsini value was computed and adopted for the star.\nIn the final iteration only the 5 remaining parameters (2\nnormalization parameters, telluric depths, stellar depths,\nRV) were allowed to vary.\nFor the 1 observational set without any A star observations (Section 3), the target stars of that set were\nmodeled using the average A star parameters from all\nother sets as a first guess. The analysis then proceeded\nas described above. The agreement of measured stellar\nproperties (e.g. RVs, vsini) from this set and other sets\nsuggested the lack of A stars did not compromise the\nanalysis in this case, likely because of the nearly identical observing setups carefully determined each time.\nThe specific prescription used to determine multipleparameter best fits can have a significant impact on the\nresults. In this first study we adopted a minimization of\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of the procedure to derive precise radial velocities using NIRSPEC data. A telluric spectrum (top spectrum)\nis combined with a synthetic stellar spectrum (2nd spectrum) to\nconstruct a model spectrum (3rd spectrum, dotted line; difficult to\nsee) that is optimized to match an observed spectrum of AU Mic\n(3rd spectrum, solid line). The normalized dispersion of the best\nfit residuals (4th spectrum) is 1.5%, and is characteristic of the\nmajority of our fits.\n\nthe filtered difference spectra based on the downhill simplex method of Nelder & Mead (1965), as implemented\nby Press et al. (1992)3 . Our implementation of this prescription enforced user-specified limits on each parameter by restarting an iteration with new parameters if any\nwere out of bounds. The minimization proceeded until\nboth the best fit \u03c72 dropped by less than one percent\nand all parameters remain consistent with recent values.\nFigure 1 shows an example model spectrum for comparison with the observed spectrum of the young star\nAU Mic. The residuals to the fit have a normalized dispersion of 1.5%, which is typical for the majority of modeled spectra. We note that the results\nfrom this last stage yield absolute RVs, since they are\ndetermined relative to at rest telluric absorption features. These values are then converted to barycentric velocities using a correction prescription accurate to\n\u223c 1 m/s (G. Basri; priv. comm.). For the interested\nreader, we note that Seifahrt et al. (2008), Blake et al.\n(2010), Bean et al. (2010), Crockett et al. (2011) and\nMuirhead et al. (2011) provide detailed descriptions of\ncomplementary methods to determine precise RVs with\nnod-subtracted infrared spectra.\n6. RESULTS\n\nIn Table 2 we summarize the results of our spectroscopic modeling effort to extract RVs. The second column lists the synthetic model parameters (Tef f , log(g)\n) assigned in the spectral fits to each star, and the third\ncolumn lists the determined vsini values. Uncertainties\nin the vsini values are set to be the standard deviation\nof the vsini estimates using all epochs for each star and\nthus are not necessarily free of systematic effect. The\nvery large uncertainty for TWA 23 may be a consequence\nof its spectroscopic companion (Section 6.2) broadening\nits line profiles in some epochs.\nThe fourth column in Table 2 lists the mean RV and\n3 The version of this multiple-parameter optimization available\nin the IDL Astronomy User's Library, called AMEOBA, must be\nconverted to double-precision to converge self-consistently.\n\n\fThe Search for Young Planets\n\n7\n\n\u221a\nthe uncertainty in this mean (\u03c3/ N ), calculated from all\nobservations. The uncertainties in the mean range from\n12 m/s to 65 m/s for single stars; these are some of the\nmost precise absolute system RV measurements ever for\nyoung stars. The fifth and sixth columns list the number\nof observations (N ) and the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the\nRV measurements extracted from these observations. In\nthe following analysis, we include GJ 873 in the statistics\ndetermined for young stars.\nIn the Appendix, RV measurements from each epoch\nfor all stars are provided. The calculation of the measurement uncertainties are describe below. Figure 2 illustrates several RV curves, including the field star GJ725\nA (M3.5), the flare star GJ 873 (M3.5), the debris disk\nhost AU Mic, and the components of the wide binary\nTWA 8.\nIn the following sections the ensemble RV dispersions,\nas measured by the standard deviations, are used to assess empirically the precision with which RVs can be\nmeasured and to identify RV variables.\n6.1. Error Analysis\n\nFor single stars, the RV dispersions are assumed to\nstem from 3 causes of variability: (1) a theoretical photon noise error (\u03c3phot ) based on the SNR of the observed\nspectrum and the number and shape of the features in\nbest-fit synthetic and telluric spectra, (2) an instrumental error (\u03c3inst ) based on the characteristics of NIRSPEC\nspectra, and (3) an intrinsic stellar error (\u03c3stel ) caused by\nstellar activity. Although the second and third causes are\nlikely attributable to non-stochastic events (e.g. variable\nbias, fringing or stellar flares, star spots, respectively),\nwe nevertheless assume that these variability sources\nadd in quadrature to produce the observed dispersions\n(\u03c3obs 2 = \u03c3phot 2 + \u03c3inst 2 + \u03c3stel 2).\nObservations of the 3 slowly rotating single field stars\nare used to quantify the magnitude of \u03c3inst . As noted\nin Section 2, previous precise RV measurements of these\nstars show that their \u03c3stel is small (< 10 m/s); we assign values of zero for all 3 stars. The \u03c3phot values\nare calculated for each pair averaged observation using\nthe SNR and a prescription similar to that outlined in\nButler et al. (1996). Essentially this error term is computed as the photon-limited Doppler error of the best fit\nsynthetic spectrum added in quadrature with the photonlimited wavelength error of the best fit telluric spectrum.\nBecause we successfully achieved similar high SNRs for\nall observations, the median pair-averaged \u03c3phot for the\n3 field stars are similar (26.2 m/s, 26.4 m/s, 27.1 m/s).\nWe use these to estimate \u03c3inst by removing the photon noise error \u03c3phot from the observed dispersion values\n(\u03c3inst 2 = \u03c3obs 2 \u2212 \u03c3phot 2). The \u03c3inst values for these 3\nstars are consistent to within 4 m/s, with a median of\n46 m/s. These values are only slightly smaller than their\nobserved dispersions, as expected for high SNR spectra\nof inactive stars. We note that a possible error term\nnot accounted for in these calculations is the stability of\nthe telluric features used for calibration. However, optical (Cochran et al. 1988) and infrared (Seifahrt et al.\n2010) RV studies conducted with other facilities have\nshown these features to be stable to . 10 m/s; their stability is thus not a limiting factor for precisely measured\nRVs with NIRSPEC. These results imply that achieving RV precisions significantly better than \u223c 40 m/s\n\nFigure 2. RV curves for the slowly rotating single field star GJ725\nA, the chromospherically active star GJ 873, the debris disk host\nAU Mic, and the components of the wide binary TWA 8; average\nerrorbars are illustrated in the upper left of each panel. The dispersions of the field stars, like GJ 725 A, demonstrate an observing\nprecision of \u223c 50 m/s using high SNR spectra of slowly rotating\ninactive stars.

Errors inherent to our modeling prescription are incorporated into the instrument error reported here. Regardless, this precision is considerably\nbetter than intended in the design specifications, and a\ncredit to the talent of the instrument team.\nMeasurement errors are assigned to each observation\n(listed in the Appendix) by calculating \u03c3phot for each\npair-averaged observation, and adding that in quadrature with an assumed constant \u03c3inst of 46 m/s. These\nerrors do not account for any possible errors due to stellar activity (\u03c3stel ). The RV errors listed in the Appendix\nfor the 21 young stars range from 46 m/s to 79 m/s with\na median values of 53 m/s. The \u03c3obs values are nevertheless significantly larger than these error estimates,\nranging from 71 - 197 m/s for the single stars (identified\nbelow). This implies a significant contribution from the\n\u03c3stel to the observed dispersions.\nSince stellar activity is known to be correlated with\nrotational velocity(e.g. Baliunas et al. 1995), we investigate the relation between the observed dispersions and\nprojected rotational velocities in Figure 3. Although\nthere is considerable spread in the dispersion values near\na vsini = 10 km/s, the 2 quantities nevertheless appear\nto be correlated. Stars with vsini values less than 12\nkm/s have a median dispersion of 115 m/s while those\nrotating more rapidly have a median dispersion of 179\nm/s.\n\n12\n15\n15\n11\n11\n11\n12\n14\n13\n15\n\n6.2. New and Candidate RV Variables\n\nWe use the apparent relation between the observed RV\ndispersions (\u03c3obs ) and vsini values illustrated in Figure\n3 to objectively identify possible RV variables. To do\nthis, a quadratic polynomial is fit to the data iteratively;\nstars with dispersions 2\u03c3 above the best fit are identified\nas possible RV variables and subsequently excluded from\nthe fit. This identified 3 stars as possible variable stars,\nTWA 23, GJ 3305, and TWA 13A. We note that these\nsame stars would be identified using a linear fit to the\ndata, but we adopt and illustrate in Figure 3 a quadratic\nfit which can account for saturation in the dispersion, if\npresent, given the limited range of dispersions observed\n(see below).\nTwo stars have dispersions well above their predicted\ndispersion for their vsini, TWA 23 (\u03c3obs = 2425 m/s)\nand GJ 3305 (\u03c3obs = 457 m/s; Table 2). These large\ndispersions, in combination with their smoothly accelerating RV variations illustrated in Figure 4 confidently\nindicate that these stars are spectroscopic binaries. In\nthe case of GJ 3305, the observed variations are likely\ndue to its 0.\u2032\u2032 093 companion (Kasper et al. 2007). The\ndiscovery of this spatially resolved companion mid-way\nthrough our observational program is why we have fewer\nobservations of it; it was considered a less likely place to\nfind a young planet. In the case of TWA 23, the follow-up\nobservations in 2009 helped to establish an upper limit\non its orbital period, but its orbit is still underdeter-\n\n\fThe Search for Young Planets\nmined. In Figure 5 we show 3 plausible orbital solutions\nfor TWA 23, determined using a standard iterative nonlinear least-squares method (Levenberg-Marquardt, outlined in Press et al. 1992, p. 650); with rms residuals of\n\u223c 0.2 km/s in all cases, the 3 fits are equally good. The\norbital periods of these 3 fits are 517 d, 777 d, and 1552 d\nwith amplitudes of 4 km/s, 5 km/s, and 5 km/s. As with\nGJ 3305, its companion is more likely to have a stellar\nmass. Nevertheless, the discovery of these relatively low\namplitude spectroscopic binaries highlights the potential\nfor new discoveries that high-precision infrared RVs have\nwhen applied to young stars.\nThe RV dispersion of one other star stands out as being\nmarginally above (3.4\u03c3) the best-fit relation, TWA 13A.\nInspection of its RV curve shown in Figure 4 reveals large\namplitude variations (> 200 m/s) on relatively short (1-2\nday) timescales. These types of variations are the type\nexpected if TWA 13A is orbited by a hot Jupiter-like\ncompanion. Unfortunately our sampling and precision\nare insufficient to confirm this possibility. We classify it\nas a candidate variable4\nIt is possible that the larger-than-expected RV dispersion of TWA 13A is caused by either instrumental errors\nor stellar activity being larger than expected for this star\nduring these observations; these sources of variation are\nharder to predict and account for. As a possible test\nfor the former, we compared the RV dispersion of TWA\n13A to that of its companion TWA 13B. Both stars are\nequally bright (K = 7.5) and in 13 of TWA 13A's 14\nobservations, both stars were observed either immediately before or after one another. If the NIRSPEC detector was especially noisy during these observations, it\nlikely would have affected observations of TWA 13B as\nwell. However, the observed dispersion of TWA 13B\n(\u03c3obs = 149 m/s) agrees almost exactly with that predicted from its vsini (142 m/s). This strengthens the\ncase that TWA 13A is a RV variable star, but unfortunately it is not yet possible to determine if the variations\nare caused by a companion or stellar activity.\n7. DISCUSSION\n7.1. Companion Detection Limits\n\nCompanion mass detection limits are determined via\nMonte Carlo simulations. Since this survey is most sensitive to short period companions, we set limits only at\nrepresentative orbital periods, namely 3, 10, 30 and 100\ndays. The shortest period is choosen to be near the peak\nin the orbital period distribution of hot Jupiters while\nthe other periods are chosen to demonstrate how the\nsensitivity declines with increasing orbital period, given\nthe precision and temporal sampling of this survey. For\neach star, a set of 10,000 orbits is generated with random\ninclinations, phases, and companions spanning a broad\nrange of planetary and brown dwarf masses. For discussion purposes, we refer to companions with masses \u2264 13\nMJupiter as planets and more massive companions (up to\n\u223c 65 MJupiter ) as brown dwarfs. All orbits are assumed\n4 Prior to the follow-up observations in 2009, TWA 13A was even\nfurther above the best fit relation (\u03c3obs = 261 m/s versus 242 m/s);\nthe new observations near its mean reduced its overall dispersion.\nHowever, since it was initially identified as a candidate variable for\nfollow-up observations, and remains somewhat discrepant with its\nexpected precision, we continue to classify it as a candidate RV\nvariable.\n\n9\n\nFigure 3. RV dispersion versus projected rotational velocities;\nwith a dispersion of 2425 m/s, TWA 23 is not illustrated on this\nplot. A quadratic function is fit via least squares to the data (solid\nline) and systems with dispersions 2\u03c3 above this best fit (dotted\nline) are considered candidate RV variables.\n\nto be circular, as would be expected if these companions migrated to these locations via disk interactions (e.g.\nLin et al. 1996). In combination with the stellar masses\nlisted in Table 1, these orbits are used to predict a set\nof RV measurements with the same temporal sampling\nas each star's set of observations. An assumed Gaussian\nerror of 53 m/s, equal to the median observational error\nabove (\u03c3phot 2 + \u03c3inst 2), is added to these measurements;\nwe note however that adding these relatively small errors\nhas no significant effect upon the results. Conservative\ndetection limits are then set by determining the companion mass that induces a RV dispersion that is 2\u03c3 greater\nthan the expected dispersion for the star's vsini (see Figure 3) 99% of the time; this is consistent with the criteria\nused to identify candidate variables such as TWA 13A.\nThe companion detection limits determined from this\nprescription at 3, 10, 30, and 100 days are listed for all\nsingle stars in Table 2. The 3 field stars, which have\nthe smallest RV dispersions, have the lowest companion\nmass detection limits. On average, these are 4.1, 6.0,\n10, and 13 MJupiter for the above 4 orbital periods, respectively. These observations confirm that these stars\nhave no short-period massive planet or brown dwarf companions at any orbial orientation except possibly nearly\nface-on.\nIn assessing the young stars detection limits, we exclude the known or candidate RV variables and use only\nresults for stars with 11 or more observations (thus excluding GJ 182 with only 6 observations). For this 18\nstar subsample, the average detection limits are 8.5, 13,\n17, and 26 MJupiter at the above 4 orbital periods, respectively. The lowest mass stars within this subset have\nthe lowest companion detection limits, as expected since\n2/3\nthe detection limit scales as Mstar . For example, the\n0.12 M\u2299 star TWA 8B has the smallest detection limits\nof 3.6, 4.5, 7.1, and 10.6 MJupiter , respectively, despite\n\n\f10\n\nBailey et al.\n\nFigure 5. Three plausible orbits for the binary star TWA 23,\nwith periods of 1552 d, 777 d, and 517 d.\n\nan edge-on orientation for the orbit. This yields companion detection limits of 1.8, 2.5, 3.9 and 5.2 MJupiter at\nthe above 4 periods, respectively. These detection limits\nare consistent with the lack of any transiting Jupitersized planets found in this system (Hebb et al. 2007).\nIf massive Jupiters do exist within the AU Mic system,\nthey have not migrated inwards in its \u223c 12 Myr lifetime.\n7.2. The Effect of Stellar Activity on Precision RV\n\nFigure 4. RV curves for the new binary stars TWA 23 and GJ\n3305, and the candidate RV variable TWA 13A; typical uncertainties in these measurements are 50-60 m/s. The long time-scale (> 1\nyr) RV trends of TWA 23 and GJ 3305 are indicative of low mass\nstellar, or possibly brown dwarf companions. In the case of GJ\n3305, the motion is likely due to its spatially resolved companion\n(Kasper et al. 2007). The large amplitude, short-timescale variations of TWA 13A are indicative of a short-period gas giant planet\n(e.g. a hot Jupiter), but the data are insufficient to confirm this.\n\nhaving an observed dispersion of 123 m/s. Overall, the\nobservations only exclude the presence of the very massive hot (P < 10 d) Jupiters. However, the observations\nconfidently exlude all hot brown dwarf companions and\nall but the lowest mass 'warm' (10 < P < 100 d) brown\ndwarf companions.\nThe RV measurements would translate to much stricter\ncompanion detection limits if the companion's orbital\nplane is assumed to be edge-on. This assumption is plausible for the young star AU Mic that is known to harbor\nan edge-on circumstellar disk (e.g. Kalas et al. 2004).\nAt an assumed age of 12 Myr, its M0 spectral type corresponds to a stellar mass of 0.73 M\u2299 . For this star,\nwe calculate companion detection limits using the same\nMonte Carlo simulations described above, but assuming\n\nMeasurements\nOne of the primary motivations for conducting this\nRV survey of young stars at infrared wavelengths, as opposed to optical wavelengths, was to mitigate the RV\nvariations induced by stellar activity; we subsequently\nrefer to this as stellar jitter. To investigate the success\nof this, we compare estimates of the stellar jitter of our\ninfrared observations to the estimates from optical observations. The infrared stellar jitter is estimated by\nsubtracting, in quadrature, the instrumental and average theoretical errors from the observed dispersion for\n2\n2\n2\n2\neach star (\u03c3stel\n= \u03c3obs\n\u2212 \u03c3inst\n\u2212 \u03c3phot\n). This yielded values ranging from 36 m/s to 181 m/s, with a median value\nof 113 m/s; these are illustrated in Figure 6 versus vsini.\nThe values are then compared to the stellar jitter values calculated from RV measurements in\nPaulson & Yelda (2006), who obtained precise optical\nRV measurements of 6 members of the \u03b2 Pic Association, including 2 stars in the present survey here, AU\nMic and GJ 3305. GJ 3305 is not included in these comparisons, however, because we identify it as a spectroscopic binary star. Paulson & Yelda (2006) obtained\nprecise RVs using the telluric oxygen band at 6900 \u00c5\nwith an instrumental precision of 40 m/s. As with the\ninfrared measurements, the stellar jitter is estimated by\nsubtracting, in quadrature, the theoretical and instru-\n\n\f11\n\nThe Search for Young Planets\nmental uncertainties from the observed velocity dispersions. These results are plotted in Figure 6 versus vsini,\nand range from 270 m/s to 490 m/s, with a mean of of\n360 m/s. A comparison of these suggests that the stellar\njitter at infrared (K-band) is approximately 3 times less\nthan at optical wavelengths (R-band). This is consistent with the reductions meausured by Hu\u00e9lamo et al.\n(2008) for the similar age star TW Hya. The recent study\nby Mahmud et al. (2011) reports similar reductions between infrared and optical jitter for the younger T Tauri\nstars DN Tau and Hubble I 4, and slightly larger reductions (a factor 4-5) for V827 Tau and V836 Tau.\nAlthough the binary star GJ 3305 is not included\nin these comparisons, we note that Paulson & Yelda\n(2006) do not identify it as a spectroscopic binary, despite having observed it 11 times on 4 different nights.\nWe attribute this to their limited sampling, its apparently low amplitude RV variations, and the larger stellar jitter associated with optical observations of young\nstars. We also note that we can not confirm the claim\nof Song et al. (2003) that HIP 12545 is a single-lined\nspectroscopic binary. Although they do not report individual measurements, they claim to have measured large\n(20 km/s) RV variations for this star using on high dispersion optical spectra. Our 14 measurements of this star\nspanning from 2004 November 19 to 2006 July 6 have a\ndispersion of only 0.18 km/s.\nAltogether these results confirm the expectation that\ninfrared observations mitigate the RV variations due to\nstellar activity and, moreover, quantify the benefit. As\ndiscussed in the introduction, this is expected if the RV\nvariations are primarily caused by cool star spots. However, infrared observations made during other chromospheric events such as giant flares or coronal mass ejections may have little or no benefit over optical measurements. It has been shown that giant flares on active\nstars can cause temporary shifts in optically determined\nRV of several hundred m/s (Reiners 2009). Although\nwe do not have information to identify flare or flare-like\nevents in our data, this could explain the occasional large\n(> 200 m/s), one-time RV changes seen for some stars.\nOne of our clearest examples occured during observations\nof the slowly rotating star TWA 7 (vsini = 4.5 km/s).\nAs illustrated in Figure 7, all but 1 of its 12 RV measurements are consistent to within 100 m/s (\u03c3obs = 47\nm/s); the discrepant epoch deviates by \u223c 300 m/s from\nthe mean RV of the other 11 epochs. Comparisons of\nstars observed immediately before and after this epoch\nshow no similar large amplitude deviations, which might\nbe expected if the detector was especially noisy at this\ntime; the deviation appears to be limited to this observation. The SNR of this observation is also above the\nmean of the remaining observations, and the spectrum\nshows no defects, such as an cosmic ray event that was\nnot corrected in the optimal extraction. This leads us to\nbelieve the deviation is intrinsic to the star itself. Because we can't fully explain the event (or others like it),\nwe highlight it here as a cautionary remark for future\nsurveys. Coordinated photometric and/or spectroscopic\nobservations that target chromospheric indicators may\nhelp identify these events, which when excluded, would\nimprove the overall sensitivity to low mass companions.\nFinally, the ensemble infrared stellar jitter results provide a guide for the achievable RV precision for young\n\nFigure 6. Stellar jitter versus projected rotational velocity. The\nstellar jitter at infrared wavelengths (solid circles) is significantly\nless than at optical wavelengths (empty circles), as expected if it\nis primarily caused by cool star spots. The dotted line illustrates\nthe upper boundary of infrared stellar jitter values, and illustrates\nthe tentative evidence for saturation at \u223c 180 m/s for vsini values\nabove 12 km/s.\n\nactive stars in the limit of high SNR spectra with no\nwavelength calibration error. For the slowest rotating\nstars (vsini < 6 km/s), the median stellar jitter is 77\nm/s (1 \u03c3 spread of 21 m/s). For stars with modest rotation (6 km/s < vsini < 12 km/s), the median stellar jitter is 108 m/s (1 \u03c3 spread of 43 m/s). And for\nthe most rapidly rotating stars (vsini of 12 - 23 km/s),\nthe median stellar jitter is 168 m/s (1 \u03c3 spread of 24\nm/s). We also note that none of the 4 stars with vsini\nvalues > 12 km/s have stellar jitter values above 180\nm/s, possibly hinting at stellar jitter saturation (Figure\n6). Although the available data cannot robustly confirm this, we highlight this possibility because this vsini\nlimit is similar to the observed X-ray saturation limit of\n\u223c 15 km/s, though for slightly more massive stars in the\nPleiades (Stauffer et al. 1994); the X-ray saturation is\ninterpreted as a consequence of maximal coverage of star\nspots. Likewise, we find that stars with the largest stellar\njitter have rotational periods < 3.3 days (Table 1). As\ndemonstrated in (Pizzolato et al. 2003), subsolar mass\nstars with rotation periods < 3.0 - 3.5 days (depending\nsomewhat on mass) all have saturated X-ray emission.\nGiven that the most rapidly rotating stars studied here\nappear to be near or beyond the regime where X-rays\nsaturate, its plausible to presume that the stellar jitter\nis also saturated. The results have implications for how\nprecisely the radial velocities of rapidly rotating stars can\nbe determined.\n8. SUMMARY\n\nWe present the results of a high-precision infrared RV\nstudy of 20 young stars in the \u03b2 Pic and TW Hya Associations, as well as the chromospherically active, young\ndisk M3.5 star GJ 873. High spectral resolution (R\n\u223c 30,000) measurements at 2.3 \u03bcm were obtained with\n\n\f12\n\nBailey et al.\n\nFigure 7. RV curve of the slowly rotating young star TWA 7; an\naverage errorbar is illustrated in the upper left. All but 1 of the\nRVs are consistent to within 100 m/s (\u03c3 = 47). The one outlier is\npossibly due to a transient stellar event such as a flare.\n\nNIRSPEC at the Keck Observatory; the majority of stars\nhave more than a dozen epochs, with a typical temporal\nsampling of several observations over a week-long run,\nand then several runs over 2 to 3 years. Precise RVs are\ndetermined using telluric absorption features as an absolute wavelength reference. Each observation is modeled\nas the combination of a telluric spectrum and a synthetically generated stellar spectrum, both convolved by a\nparametrized instrumental profile and projected onto a\nparametrized wavelength solution. The best fit, which\nincludes the RV of the star, is determined by minimizing\nthe \u03c72 .\nThis modeling technique yields RV dispersions of \u223c 50\nm/s for 13+ epochs each of 3 slowly rotating field stars.\nThe dispersion of these RV measurements is dominated\nby instrumental errors and thus \u223c 50 m/s can be considered a practical precision limit for NIRPSEC (see also\nBlake et al. 2010); this precision is nevertheless well\nabove NIRSPEC's original design specifications. Significant improvements to this precision will likley require a\nnew detector to mitigate dominant noise sources such as\nfringing, variable bias, and read noise.\nThe observed RV dispersions for young stars range\nfrom 48 m/s to 197 m/s. These dispersions are dominated by noise from stellar activity, or stellar jitter. We\nestimate the contribution from stellar jitter by subtracting, in quadrature, the average instrumental noise (46\nm/s) and the calculated theoretical noise (\u223c 40 m/s)\nfrom the observed dispersions. The stellar jitter increases\nwith projected rotational velocity (vsini). The slowest\nrotating stars (vsini < 6 km/s) have a median stellar jitter of 77 m/m, modest rotation stars (6 km/s < vsini <\n12 km/s) have a median stellar jitter of 108 m/s, and the\nmost rapidly rotating stars (vsini of 12 - 23 km/s) have\na median stellar jitter of 168 m/s. There is also tentative\nevidence that stellar jitter saturates at \u223c 180 m/s above\nvsini values of \u223c 12 km/s, or below rotational periods of\n\u223c 3 \u2212 4 days, consistent with the rate of rotation that\ncauses X-rays to saturate.\nThese infrared stellar jitter values are, on average, a\nfactor of 3 less than the stellar jitter values of similar\nage \u03b2 Pic Association stars observed at optical (R-band)\nwavelengths. Case studies by Hu\u00e9lamo et al. (2008)\nand Mahmud et al. (2011) corroborate these reductions.\nThis is expected if stellar jitter is predominantly caused\n\nby cool star spots, and confirms that infrared measurements have a significant advantage over optical measurements in obtaining precise RV measurements of active\nstars.\nThree stars have RV dispersions significantly above the\nlevel expected for their vsini. The smoothly accelerating\nRVs of 2 of these stars, GJ3305 and TWA 23, indicate\nthey are single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The RV orbits are still under-determined. In the case of GJ 3305,\nthe motion is likely caused by its recently identified \u223c 93\nmilliarcsecond companion (Kasper et al. 2007). The 3rd\nstar, TWA 13A, exhibits large amplitude (> 200 m/s),\nshort-timescale variations indicative of a hot Jupiter-like\ncompanion, but the available data are insufficient to confirm this. We label it as a candidate RV variable. We\nalso note that the relative rarity of hot Jupiter companions (\u223c 1%) implies that a first discovery in this small\nsample of 20 young stars would be most fortuitous.\nFor the remainder of the sample, these observations exclude the presence of any 'hot' (P < 3 days) companions\nmore massive than 8 MJup , and any 'warm' (P < 30 day)\ncompanions more massive than 17 MJup , on average. Assuming an edge-on orbit for the edge-on disk system AU\nMic, these observations exclude the presence of any hot\nJupiters more massive than 1.8 MJup or warm Jupiters\nmore massive than 3.9 MJup . If massive Jupiters exist in\nthe AU Mic system, they have not migrated inwards in\nits \u223c 12 Myr lifetime.\nWhile the effect of star spots will continue to be a limiting factor in the search for young short-period planets,\neven at infrared wavelengths, the results presented here\nelucidate better the opportunities for determining precise RVs from infrared observations in the limit of high\nstellar activity.\nWe are grateful to the support staff at Keck observatory, especially Grant Hill and Jim Lyke, and to the\nscientists who built and continue to maintain NIRSPEC,\nespecially Dr. Ian McLean. We appreciate the data provided by the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive and\nthe privilege to observe on the revered summit of Mauna\nKea.\nREFERENCES\nAbranin, E.
