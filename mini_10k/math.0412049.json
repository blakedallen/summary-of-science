The main technique will be pull-back by a base change. We only exclude\nthe general construction involving the induced J-map of the fibration (considered as a\nbase change generally of degree 24, cf. [MP2, section 2]). The base changes we construct\nwill have degree at most 8. Additionally there is another effective method if we allow\nthe extremal K3 surface to have non-reduced fibres. Then we can also manipulate the\nWeierstrass equations by adding or transferring common factors, thus changing the shape\nof singular fibres rather than introducing new cusps. In total, this approach will enable\nus to realize 201 out of the 325 configurations of singular fibres which exist for extremal\nelliptic K3 fibrations by the classification of [SZ]. Note, however, that the configuration\ndoes in general not determine the isomorphism class of the complex surface (cf. [1,2,3,10,2*]\n(No. 148) in Section 7).\nFor most of this paper, we will concentrate on extremal elliptic K3 fibrations with only\nsemi-stable fibres. The determination of the 112 possible configurations of singular fibres\noriginally goes back to Miranda\nand Persson [MP2]. For 20 of them, Weierstrass equations\n\u221a\nover Q (or in one case Q( 5)) have been obtained in [I] or [Sh], [LY] and [TY]. These give\nrise to the elliptic K3 surface with the maximal singular fibre (the first one from the list\nin [MP2]), the Shioda modular ones and those coming from semi-stable extremal (hence\nShioda modular) rational elliptic surfaces after a quadratic base change. Because of the\nconstruction, it is easy to determine the unique C-isomorphism classes of these surfaces\nover Q using [SZ].\nThe main idea of this paper consists in applying a base change of higher degree to other\nextremal rational elliptic surfaces (namely those with three cusps). In the pull-back surface,\nwe replace the non-reduced singular fibres in such a way by semi-stable fibres that it is\nan extremal K3. Indeed, five of the Shioda modular rational elliptic surfaces can also be\nobtained in such a way according to [MP1, section 7]. Here, we investigate those base\n\n1\n\n\f2 Elliptic surfaces over P1 with a section\n\n2\n\nchanges which do not factor through the Shioda modular surfaces. We find Weierstrass\nequations for 38 further extremal semi-stable elliptic K3 fibrations, only 6 of which are\nnot defined over Q. Again, the isomorphism classes of these surfaces can be determined in\nadvance since we know the Mordell-Weil groups. The surfaces over Q realize the following\n32 configurations of singular fibres in the notation of [MP2]:\n[1,1,1,2,3,16]\n[1,1,1,5,6,10]\n[1,1,2,4,6,10]\n[1,2,2,2,5,12]\n[1,2,2,5,6,8]\n[1,2,4,4,6,7]\n[1,3,4,4,4,8]\n[2,2,3,4,5,8]\n\n[1,1,1,2,5,14]\n[1,1,2,2,3,15]\n[1,1,3,3,8,8]\n[1,2,2,2,7,10]\n[1,2,2,6,6,7]\n[1,2,4,5,6,6]\n[2,2,2,4,6,8]\n[2,2,4,4,6,6]\n\n[1,1,1,3,3,15]\n[1,1,2,3,3,14]\n[1,1,3,4,6,9]\n[1,2,2,3,4,12]\n[1,2,3,3,3,12]\n[1,3,3,3,5,9]\n[2,2,2,3,5,10]\n[2,3,3,3,4,9]\n\n[1,1,1,3,6,12]\n[1,1,2,4,4,12]\n[1,2,2,2,3,14]\n[1,2,2,3,6,10]\n[1,2,3,4,4,10]\n[1,3,3,5,6,6]\n[2,2,3,3,4,10]\n[2,3,4,4,5,6]\n\nThe additional fibrations which result from this approach, but can only be defined over\nsome quadratic or cubic extension of Q, are\n[1,1,2,2,4,14],\n[1,2,2,4,7,8],\n\n[1,1,2,6,6,8],\n[1,2,3,3,6,9],\n\n[1,2,2,4,5,10]\n[1,2,3,4,6,8].\n\nFor the non-semi-stable extremal K3 fibrations which can be derived from rational elliptic\nsurfaces, we produce two long tables in Section 7.\nThis paper is organized as follows: After shortly recalling some basic facts about elliptic\nsurfaces in the next section (2), we will spend the major part of it with constructing\nthe base changes and giving the resulting equations for the semi-stable extremal elliptic\nK3 surfaces (Sections 3, 4, 5, 6). Eventually we will also consider the non-semi-stable\nfibrations in Section 7 although we will keep their treatment quite concise.\nOne final remark seems to be in order: There are, of course, many other ways to produce\nextremal (or singular) elliptic K3 surfaces. The perhaps best known is the concept of double\nsextics as introduced in [P]. We will not pursue this approach here, so the interested reader\nis also referred to [MP3] and [ATZ] for instructive applications.\n\n2\n\nElliptic surfaces over P1 with a section\nr\n\nAn elliptic surface over P1 , say Y \u2192 P1 , with a section is given by a minimal Weierstrass\nequation\ny 2 = x3 + Ax + B\nwhere A and B are homogeneous polynomials in the two variables of P1 of degree 4M\nand 6M , respectively, for some M \u2208 N. Then the section is the point at \u221e. The term\nminimal refers to the common factors of A and B: They are not allowed to have a common\nirreducible factor with multiplicity greater than 3 in A and greater than 5 in B. Otherwise\nwe could cancel these factors by a change of variables. This convention restricts the\nsingularities of the Weierstrass equation to rational double points. Then, the surface Y is\nthe minimal desingularization. In this paper, we are mainly interested in examples where\nboth A and B have rational coefficients (while the results of [MP2] will only imply the\nexistence of A and B over some number field). Of course, we can also assume A and B to\nhave (minimal) integer coefficients, but we will not go into detail here.\nAs announced in the introduction, we are going to pay special attention to the singular\nfibres of Y . For a general choice of A and B there will be 12M of them (each a rational\ncurve with a node). The types of the singular fibres, which were first classified by Kodaira\nin [Ko], can be read off directly from the j-function of Y (cf. [Si, IV.9, table 4.1]). Up\nto a factor, this is the quotient of A3 by the discriminant \u2206 of Y which is defined as\n\u2206 = \u221216 (4A3 + 27B 2 ):\n1728 (4A)3\nj=\u2212\n.\n\u2206\n\n\f2 Elliptic surfaces over P1 with a section\n\n3\n\nThen Y has singular fibres above the zeroes of \u2206 which we call the cusps of Y . Let x0 be\na cusp and n the order of vanishing of \u2206 at x0 . The fibre above x0 is called semi-stable\nif it is a rational curve with a node (for n = 1) or a cycle of n lines, n > 1. In Kodaira's\nnotation, this is type In . The fibre above x0 is semi-stable if and only if A does not vanish\nat x0 (i.e. iff x0 is not a common zero of A and B). On the other hand, we get either a\nnon-reduced fibre (distinguished by a \u2217 ) over x0 if A and B both vanish at x0 to order at\nleast 2 and 3, respectively, or an additive fibre of type II, III or IV otherwise.\nOne common property of the singular fibres is that in every case the vanishing order of \u2206\nat the cusp x0 equals the Euler number of the fibre above x0 . Recall that H1 (Y, OY ) = 0\nand pg = dim H2 (Y, OY ) = M \u2212 1, while the canonical divisor KY = (M \u2212 2) F for a\ngeneral fibre F (cf. e.g. [M1, Lecture III]). Hence, Y is K3 (resp. rational) if and only if\nM = 2 (resp. M = 1). The Euler number of Y equals the sum of the Euler numbers of its\n(singular) fibres. By the above considerations, this coincides with the degree 12M of \u2206.\nHence, we obtain that Y is a K3 surface if and only if its Euler number equals 24. (On\nthe contrary, Y is rational if and only if e(Y ) = 12.)\nBefore discussing the effect of a base change on the elliptic surface Y , let us at first\nintroduce the following notation: We say that a map\n\u03c0 : P1 \u2192 P1\nhas ramification index (n1 , ..., nk ) at x0 \u2208 P1 if x0 has k pre-images under \u03c0 with respective\norders ni (i = 1, . . . , k). The base change of Y by \u03c0 is simply defined as the pull-back\nsurface\n\u03c0\u25e6r\nX \u2212\u2192 P1 .\n\nHere, we substitute \u03c0 into the Weierstrass equation and j-function of Y and subsequently\nnormalize to obtain X. Let \u03c0 have ramification index (n1 , . . . , nk ) at the cusp x0 of Y .\nThen a semi-stable singular fibre of type In above x0 is replaced by k fibres of types\nIn1 n , . . . , Ink n in the pull-back X.\nFor a non-semi-stable singular fibre the substitution process is non-trivial for two reasons:\nOn the one hand the Weierstrass equation might simply lose its minimality through the\nsubstitution. On the other hand, the minimalized Weierstrass equation can still become\ninflated. This means that the pull-back surface has more than one non-reduced fibre.\nThen there is a quadratic twist of the surface, sending x 7\u2192 \u03b12 x and y 7\u2192 \u03b13 y, which\nreplaces an even number of non-reduced fibres by their reduced relatives (i.e. In\u2217 by In\nand II \u2217 , III \u2217, IV \u2217 by IV, III, II, respectively). Here, \u03b1 is the vanishing polynomial of\nthe cusps of the non-reduced fibres. Following [M2] this process will be called deflation.\nSince our main interest lies in elliptic (K3) surfaces with only semi-stable fibres, deflation\nprovides a useful tool to construct such surfaces via base change.\nIt is exactly these two methods (minimalization and deflation after a suitable base change)\nwhich we will use to resolve the non-semi-stable fibres of the base surface Y . The explicit\nbehaviour of the singular fibres under a base change can be derived from [Si, IV.9, table\n4.1] or found in [MP1, section 7]. We sketch it in the next figure where the number next\nto an arrow denotes the order of ramification under \u03c0 (of one particular pre-image). The\nfibres of type In\u2217 are exceptional in that they allow two possibilities of substitution by\nsemi-stable fibres: Either by ramification of even index or by pairwise deflation.\n\nI2n\n\nI0\u2217\n\nI0\u2217\n\nI0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c0\n\nII (\u2217)\n\nIII (\u2217)\n\nIV (\u2217)\n\n\u2744\nY\n\nIn\u2217\n\nFig. 1: The resolution of the non-semi-stable fibres\n\nX\n\n\f4\n\n3 The deflated base changes\n\n3\n\nThe deflated base changes\n\nOur main interest lies in finding equations over Q for extremal semi-stable elliptic K3\nfibrations. By definition, these are singular elliptic K3 surfaces with finite Mordell-Weil\ngroup and only semi-stable fibres. These assumptions are quite restrictive. It is an immediate consequence that the number of cusps has to be 6, and one finds the 112 possible\nconfigurations of singular fibres in the classification of [MP2, Thm (3.1)]. The main idea\nof this paper is to produce some of these K3 fibrations by the methods described in the\nprevious section via the pull-back of a rational elliptic surface by a base change. This\napproach is greatly helped by the good explicit knowledge one has of the rational elliptic\nsurfaces (cf. [H], [MP1], [S-H]). One only has to construct suitable base changes.\nThe starting point for our considerations is a rational elliptic surface with a section\nr\n\nY \u2192 P1 .\nFor a base change \u03c0 : P1 \u2192 P1 , let\n\n\u03c0\u25e6r\n\nX \u2212\u2192 P1\n\ndenote the pullback via \u03c0. Since the Mordell-Weil group M W (Y ) injects into M W (X),\nwe will assume Y to be extremal. Note, however, that the process of deflation can a\npriori change the Mordell-Weil group. Therefore it could also seem worth considering\nnon-extremal rational elliptic surfaces, especially those with a small number of cusps as\npresented in [H] and [S-H]. A close observation nevertheless shows that these would not\nproduce any configurations different from those known or obtained in this paper, unless\none turns to the general case where \u03c0 has degree 24. This can also be derived from [Kl,\nThm. 1.2]. A solution to the general case has recently been announced by Beukers and\nMontanus [BM].\nExtremal rational elliptic surfaces have been completely classified by Miranda-Persson in\n[MP1]. There are six semi-stable surfaces with four cusps. These had previously been\nidentified as Shioda modular by Beauville [B]. As explained, these surfaces have been\ntreated exhaustively in [TY], giving rise to the semi-stable extremal elementary fibrations\nof [P].\nFurthermore there are four surfaces with only two cusps (one of them appearing in a\ncontinuous family). We will not use these surfaces since they have no fibre of type In or\nIn\u2217 with n > 0 at all.\nThe remaining six extremal rational elliptic surfaces have three cusps. Each has exactly\none non-reduced fibre while the other two singular fibres are semi-stable. These are the\nsurfaces we are going to investigate for a pull-back via a base change. For the remaining\npart of this section we will concentrate on those (\"deflated\") base changes \u03c0 which give\n\u03c0\u25e6r\nrise to a non-inflated pull-back K3 surface X \u2212\u2192 P1 after minimalizing. The pull-back\nsurfaces coming from inflating base changes will be derived in Section 6.\nLet Y be an extremal rational elliptic surface Y with three cusps. There are a number\nof conditions on the base change \u03c0 if one wants an extremal semi-stable K3 pull-back.\nThe Euler number e(X) = 24 of the pull-back surface X predicts the degree of \u03c0, only\ndepending on the type of the non-reduced fibre W \u2217 of Y .\nOn the one hand, if W is of additive type (i.e. W \u2208 {II, III, IV }), we will eventually\nreplace it by smooth fibres after minimalizing and deflating, if necessary. Let the other\ntwo singular fibres be of type Im and In with m, n \u2208 N. Then m + n \u2264 4, and e(X) =\n(deg \u03c0)(m + n). On the other hand, let the non-reduced fibre have type Ik\u2217 . If the other\nsingular fibres have again m and n components, then we have k + m + n = 6. Therefore\nwe require deg \u03c0 = 4.\nOur assumption, that the semi-stable pull-back X is extremal, implies the minimal number\nof six singular fibres. This gives another stringent restriction. In some cases, this leads to\na contradiction to the Hurwitz formula\nX\n\u22122 \u2265 \u22122 deg \u03c0 +\n(deg \u03c0 \u2212 #\u03c0 \u22121 (x)).\nx\u2208P1\n\n\f5\n\n3 The deflated base changes\n\nFinally, as we decided to concentrate on resolving the non-reduced fibre W \u2217 by a deflated\nbase change, the ramification index at the corresponding cusp has to be divisible by 2, 3,\n4, or 6 if W = In\u2217 , IV, III, or II, respectively (cf. Fig. 1).\nIt will turn out that some of the base changes can only be defined over an extension of Q\nof low degree. Nevertheless, for any base change, the pull-back surface X will have at least\ntwo rational cusps. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we will choose these by a\nM\u00f6bius transformation to be 0 and \u221e (and a further third rational cusp, if it exists, to be\n1). For every rational surface, we will derive a Weierstrass equation over Q such that the\ncusps are 0,1 and \u221e. This gives us the opportunity to construct the base changes before\nconsidering the surfaces.\nWe require that the pull-back of a base change \u03c0 does not factor through a Shioda modular\nrational elliptic surface. Equivalently, \u03c0 does not factor into a composition \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u2032 of a\ndegree 2 map \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 and a further map \u03c0 \u2032 , such that the non-reduced fibre is already resolved\n\u03c0 \u2032 \u25e6r\n\nby \u03c0 \u2032 . Otherwise, the intermediate pull-back X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 P1 would be semi-stable and have at\nmost 4 cusps, hence it would be Shioda modular by [B].\nWe shall now investigate the deflated base changes with the above listed properties. For\nan extremal rational elliptic surface Y with three cusps, our analysis depends only on the\ntype of the non-reduced fibre W \u2217 . Throughout we employ the notation of [MP1]. For\nthe computations we wrote a straight forward Maple program. In all but two cases, this\nsufficed to determine the minimal base change. For the remaining two base changes, we\nused Macaulay to compute a solution mod p for some small primes p and then lift to\ncharacteristic 0.\nAt first assume W to be II. According to [MP1, section 5] there is, up to isomorphism, a\nunique rational elliptic surface with this fibre whose other two singular fibres are both of\ntype I1 . Denote this by X211 . For the pull-back X to have Euler number e(X) = 24, we\nwould need \u03c0 to have degree 12 and ramification index 12 or (6,6) at the cusp of the nonreduced fibre. Then, the restriction of the other two cusps to have exactly six pre-images\nunder \u03c0 leads to a contradiction to the Hurwitz formula.\nThe situation is similar if W = III. This implies Y = X321 to have further singular fibres\nI2 , I1 . The III \u2217 fibre requires ramification of index a multiple of 4, so \u03c0 must have degree\n8 with ramification index 8 or (4,4) at the cusp of this fibre. Again, the Hurwitz formula\nrules out the pull-back surface X to have only six (semi-stable) singular fibres. In Section\n6, we will construct inflating base changes for this surface which resolve the non-reduced\nfibre and are compatible with the Hurwitz formula.\nW = IV gives a priori two possibilities for the elliptic surface Y . One of them, X431 with\nsingular fibres of type IV \u2217 , I3 , I1 , does actually exist by [MP1]. Since a IV \u2217 fibre requires\nthe ramification index to be divisible by 3, we need \u03c0 to have degree 6 and ramification of\norder (3,3) at the cusp of this fibre (since ramification index 6 would contradict the other\ntwo fibres having six pre-images again by the Hurwitz formula). The suitable maps are\npresented in the next paragraphs. Throughout we assume the IV \u2217 fibre to sit above 1.\nIf such a base change was totally ramified above one of the two remaining cusps, then it\nwould necessarily be composite. Since this was excluded, we only have to deal with those\nmaps such that 0 has two or three pre-images (and then exchange 0 and \u221e).\nConsider a base change \u03c0 of degree 6 with ramification index (3,3) at 1. At first, let 0 and\n\u221e have three pre-images. Our restriction that \u03c0 does not factor, implies that at least one\nof the cusps has ramification index (3,2,1). We will assume \u221e to have this ramification\nindex. Then we search for maps such that 0 has ramification index (4,1,1), (3,2,1) or\n(2,2,2). However, a map with the last ramification cannot exist since the resulting pullback of X431 does not appear in the list of [MP2]. In the following, we will frequently use\nthis argument. Here, let us once give the details.\nAssume that such a base change \u03c0 exists. Then we can realize the configuration [2,2,2,3,6,9]\nas pull-back X from X431 . We claim that this fibration has a 2-section. Otherwise, the\n\n\f6\n\n3 The deflated base changes\n\nfibre types would imply that\n(Z/2)4 \u2286 N S(X)\u2228 /N S(X).\nSo the 2-length of the quotient would be at least 4. Let TX denote the transcendental\nlattice of X, that is TX = N S(X)\u22a5 \u2282 H2 (X, Z). Then by lattice theory [N, \u00a71],\n\u2228\nN S(X)\u2228 /N S(X) \u223c\n= TX /TX .\n\nSince here TX has rank 2, this quotient can maximally have 2-length 2. This gives the\nrequired contradiction.\nSo X has a 2-section \u03c3. Consider the quotient of X by (translation by) \u03c3. The minimal\ndesingularization Z of this is again an elliptic K3 surface. The resulting singular fibres can\nbe computed from the components which \u03c3 meets. In particular, the fibres of types I9 and\nI3 result in I18 and I6 in Z. But this is impossible, since then e(Z) > 24. Hence, X cannot\nadmit a 2-section. Since the existence of the 2-section followed from the construction via\n\u03c0, this base change cannot exist.\nThe computations show that the base change with the second ramification, \u03c0\u0303, can only be\nrealized over a cubic extension of Q. (With v a solution of 5x3 + 12x2 + 12x + 4 it can be\ngiven as \u03c0\u0303((s : t)) = (s3 (s \u2212 t)2 (s + (2 + 3v)t) : \u2212(2 + 3v)t3 (s + (1 + v)2 t)2 (s + t/(5v + 2))).\nHere, we only construct the first base change:\n\u03c03,4 :\n\nP1\n\n\u2192\n\n(s : t)\n\n7\u2192\n\nP1\n(27s4 (125t2 \u2212 90st \u2212 27s2 ) : \u22123125t3 (t \u2212 s)2 (5t + 4s)).\n\nThen 27s4 (125t2 \u2212 90st \u2212 27s2 ) + 3125t3 (t \u2212 s)2 (5t + 4s) = (25t2 \u2212 10st \u2212 9s2 )3 , so \u03c03,4\nhas the required properties.\nNow, let 0 have only two pre-images and \u221e four. The respective ramification indices are\n(5,1), (4,2) or (3,3) and (2,2,1,1) or (3,1,1,1). Only the first and the last of these do not\nallow a composition as a degree 3 and a degree 2 map. Hence, at least one of these two\nramification indices must occur for the base change to meet our criteria.\nLet us first construct the maps with ramification index (5,1) at 0. They are:\nP1\n\n\u03c05,3 :\n\n(s : t)\n\n\u2192\n\n7\u2192\n\nP1\n(729s5 (s \u2212 t) : \u2212t3 (135s3 + 9st2 + t3 ))\n\nwith 729s5 (s \u2212 t) + t3 (135s3 + 9st2 + t3 ) = (9s2 \u2212 3st \u2212 t2 )3 and\n\u03c05,2 :\n\nP1\n(s : t)\n\n\u2192\n\n7\u2192\n\nP1\n(26 33 s5 t : \u2212(s2 \u2212 4st \u2212 t2 )2 (125s2 + 22st + t2 ))\n\nwith 26 33 s5 t + (s2 \u2212 4st \u2212 t2 )2 (125s2 + 22st + t2 ) = (5s2 + 10st + t2 )3 .\nThe other base changes have ramification index (3,1,1,1) at \u221e. It is immediate that there\nis no such map \u03c0 with ramification index (3,3) at 0: After exchanging 1 and \u221e, the map\n\u03c0 would have to look like (f03 g03 : f13 g13 ) with distinct linear homogeneous factors fi , gi .\nThen, with \u033a a primitive third root of unity,\nf03 g03 \u2212 f13 g13 = (f0 g0 \u2212 f1 g1 )(f0 g0 \u2212 \u033af1 g1 )(f0 g0 \u2212 \u033a2 f1 g1 ).\nThis polynomial cannot have a cubic factor. Therefore, the next map completes the list\nof suitable base changes for X431 . Remember that we still have to take the permutation\nof 0 and \u221e via exchanging s and t into account.\n\u03c04,3 :\n\nP1\n(s : t)\n\n\u2192\n\n7\u2192\n\nP1\n(729s4 t2 : \u2212(s \u2212 t)3 (8s3 + 120s2 t \u2212 21st2 + t3 ))\n\nwith 729s4 t2 + (s \u2212 t)3 (8s3 + 120s2 t \u2212 21st2 + t3 ) = (2s2 \u2212 8st \u2212 t2 )3 .\n\n\f4 The fibrations coming from degree 4 base changes\n\n7\n\nWe conclude this section by considering the non-reduced fibre W\u2217 to equal I\u2217n for some\nn > 0. By [MP1] there are three extremal rational elliptic surfaces with such a singular\nfibre. All of them have two further singular fibres, both semi-stable. The surfaces will be\nintroduced in the next section. Independent of the surface, we have already seen that an\nadequate deflated base change \u03c0 must have degree 4 and ramification of index (2,2) or 4\nat the cusp of the In\u2217 fibre. Then X is extremal if and only if the two other cusps have\n4 or 5 pre-images, respectively. Assume that the non-reduced fibre sits above the cusp\n\u221e = (1 : 0). We now construct the base changes \u03c0 which do not factor into two maps of\ndegree 2. Equivalently, one of the cusps has ramification index (3,1).\nAt first, let the base change \u03c0 be totally ramified at \u221e. By the above considerations, the\nother two cusps have ramification indices (3,1) and (2,1,1). Up to exchanging them, for\nexample by\n\u03c6 : (s : t) 7\u2192 (t \u2212 s : t),\nthe map \u03c0 can be realized as\n\n\u03c04 : P 1\n(s : t)\n\n\u2192\n\n7\u2192\n\nP1\n(256s3 (s \u2212 t) : \u221227t4 ),\n\nsince (256s3 (s \u2212 t) + 27t4 ) = (4s \u2212 3t)2 (16s2 + 8st + 3t2 ).\nIn the other case, \u03c0 has ramification index (2,2) at \u221e. Our restrictions imply ramification\nof index (3,1) at one of the other two cusps. Without loss of generality, let this cusp\nbe 1. Then the last cusp also has two pre-images and thus ramification index (3,1) or\n(2,2). The second cannot exist: Given such a map, it could be expressed as (f02 g02 : f12 g12 )\nwith distinct homogeneous linear forms fi , gi in s, t. The factorization f02 g02 \u2212 f12 g12 =\n(f0 g0 + f1 g1 )(f0 g0 \u2212 f1 g1 ) cannot have a cubic factor. Hence 1 cannot have ramification\nindex (3,1).\nWe conclude this section with a base change \u03c02 of degree 4 with ramification indices (3,1),\n(3,1) and (2,2):\n\u03c02 : P 1\n(s : t)\n\n\u2192\n\n7\u2192\n\nP1\n(64s3 (s \u2212 t) : (8s2 \u2212 4st \u2212 t2 )2 ).\n\nIn the next two sections (4, 5), we will substitute the base changes \u03c03,4 , \u03c05,3 , \u03c05,2 , \u03c04,3 , \u03c02\nand \u03c04 into the normalized Weierstrass equations of the extremal rational elliptic surfaces\nwith three singular fibres. We will derive equations over Q for extremal K3 surfaces with\nsix singular fibres, all of which semi-stable.\n\n4\n\nThe fibrations coming from degree 4 base changes\n\nIn this and the next section (5), we proceed as follows to obtain equations for extremal\nK3 surface with six semi-stable fibres: Consider the Weierstrass equations given for the\nextremal rational elliptic surfaces in [MP1, Table 5.2]. We apply the normalizing M\u00f6bius\ntransformation which maps the cusps to 0, 1 and \u221e. Then we exhibit the deflated base\nchanges \u03c0i from the previous section. After minimalizing by an admissible change of\nvariables, this gives the Weierstrass equations for 16 extremal elliptic K3 surfaces from the\nlist of [MP2]. Throughout we choose the coefficients of the polynomials A and B involved\nin the Weierstrass equation to be minimal by rescaling, if necessary. By construction, the\npull-back surface X always inherits the sections of the rational elliptic surface Y . As a\nconsequence, we are able to derive the isomorphism class of X (in terms of the intersection\nform on its transcendental lattice) from the classification in [SZ].\nIn this section we consider only the extremal rational elliptic surfaces with an I\u2217n fibre\n(n > 0). As explained, they require a base change of degree 4. Before substituting by the\nbase changes \u03c04 or \u03c02 , we choose the normalizing M\u00f6bius transformation in such a way\nthat the In\u2217 fibre sits above \u221e.\n\n\f8\n\n4 The fibrations coming from degree 4 base changes\n\nLet us start with X411 which has Weierstrass equation\ny 2 = x3 \u2212 3 t2 (s2 \u2212 3t2 ) x + st3 (2s2 \u2212 9t2 )\nThe singular fibres are I4\u2217 over \u221e and two I1 over \u00b12. Substituting (s : t) 7\u2192 (4s \u2212 2t : t)\nmaps the two I1 fibres to 0 and 1. This gives\ny 2 = x3 \u2212 3 t2 (16s2 \u2212 16st + t2 ) x + 2 t3 (2s \u2212 t)(32s2 \u2212 32st \u2212 t2 ).\nThen, we substitute by \u03c04 and get the Weierstrass equation of an extremal K3 surface:\ny2\n\nx3 \u2212 3 (9s8 + 48s7 t + 48s4 t4 + 64s6 t2 + 128s3 t5 + 16t8 ) x\n\n=\n\n\u22122 (3s4 + 8s3 t + 8t4 )(9s8 + 48s7 t + 48s4 t4 + 64s6 t2 + 128s3 t5 \u2212 8t8 ).\n\nThis provides a realization of the configuration [1,1,1,2,3,16] in the notation of [MP2]\n(i.e. 3 fibres of type I1 , one of types I2 , I3 and I16 each).\n\nI3\n\nI1\n\n3\n\n1\n\nI2 I1 I1\n2 1\n\nI16\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\nI1\n\n0\nI1\n\n\u221e\nI4\u2217\n\nP1\n\u03c04\n\u2744\nP1\n\nFig. 2: A realization of [1,1,1,2,3,16]\nOn the other hand, we can also substitute by \u03c02 in the normalized Weierstrass equation.\nWe obtain:\ny2\n\nx3 \u2212 3 (16s8 \u2212 64s7 t \u2212 224s5 t3 + 392t4 s4 + 64s6 t2 + 112t5 s3 + 16t6 s2 + 8t7 s + t8 ) x\n\n=\n\n\u22122 (2s2 \u2212 4st \u2212 t2 )(2s2 + t2 )\n\n(16s8 \u2212 64s7 t + 544s5 t3 \u2212 952t4 s4 + 64s6 t2 \u2212 272t5 s3 + 16t6 s2 + 8t7 s + t8 ).\n\nThis realizes [1,1,3,3,8,8].\n\nI3\n\nI1\n\nI3\n\nI1\n\nI8\n\nI8\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\nI1\n\n1\nI1\n\n\u221e\nI4\u2217\n\nP1\n\u03c02\n\u2744\nP1\n\nFig. 3: A realization of [1,1,3,3,8,8]\nWe shall apply the same procedure to the surface X141 with Weierstrass equation\ny 2 = x3 \u2212 3 (s \u2212 2t)2 (s2 \u2212 3t2 ) x + s(s \u2212 2t)3 (2s2 \u2212 9t2 ).\nThe normalization of the cusps leads to the Weierstrass equation\ny 2 = x3 \u2212 3 t2 (16t2 \u2212 16st + s2 ) x + 2 t3 (s \u2212 2t)(s2 + 32st \u2212 32t2 ).\nThis has an I4 fibre above 0, I1 above 1 and I1\u2217 above \u221e.

In\nthis case we allow \u03c0 to be inflating, i.e. the pull-back X may contain non-reduced fibres\nof type In\u2217 for n \u2265 0 apart from its semi-stable fibres. The only additional assumption is\nthat their number is even. Via deflation, we can substitute these fibres by their reduced\nrelatives. The resulting semi-stable surface is a quadratic twist of X.\nOne might hope to produce a number of new configurations by this method. A close\ninspection, however, shows that none arise from the extremal rational elliptic surfaces\nconsidered in the last two sections. This approach is nevertheless useful, since it enables\nus to work with the extremal rational elliptic surface X321 as well. The reason is that\nthe Hurwitz formula is not violated if we choose the degree 8 base change \u03c0 of P1 to have\nramification index (2,2,2,2) at the cusp of the III \u2217 fibre (instead of (4,4) or 8 before). The\nfibre is thus replaced by four fibres of type I0\u2217 which can easily be twisted away.\nWe have to assume the other two cusps to have six pre-images in total. Up to exchanging\nthe cusps 0 and \u221e, there are 13 such base changes which cannot be factored through an\nextremal rational elliptic surface. In the following we concentrate on the 9 of these which\ncan be defined over Q. They result in 17 further extremal semi-stable elliptic K3 surfaces\nwhich arise by pull-back from X321 . The four base changes which are not defined over Q\nwill briefly be sketched at the end of this section.\n\n\f14\n\n6 The inflating base changes\n\nRemember that X321 has singular fibres of type III \u2217, I2 and I1 . We normalize the Weierstrass equation given in [MP1] such that the III \u2217 fibre sits above 1 and the I2 and I1\nfibres above 0 and \u221e, respectively:\ny 2 = x3 \u2212 3 (s \u2212 t)3 (s \u2212 4t) x \u2212 2 (s \u2212 t)5 (s + 8t).\nIn the following, we investigate the degree 8 base changes of P1 with ramification index\n(2,2,2,2) at 1 such that the further cusps 0 and \u221e have six pre-images in total. We will\nconcentrate on those base changes which give rise to new configurations of extremal elliptic\nK3 fibrations over Q. Without loss of generality, we assume that 0 does not have more\npre-images than \u221e (since we can exchange the cusps).\nThe three base changes which are totally ramified at 0 realize configurations known from\n[LY] or [TY]. We now turn to the base changes \u03c0 such that 0 has two pre-images. Throughout we can exclude ramification of index (2,2,2,2) at both other cusps since this would not\nallow ramification of high order at 0. We list the base changes according to the ramification\nindex at 0.\nLet \u03c0 have ramification index (7,1) at 0. There are four base changes to consider. The\ncomputations show that the base change\u221awith ramification index (4,2,1,1) at \u221e can only\nbe defined over the Galois extensions Q( \u22127). It is given at the end of this section.

This was already realized\nin the preceding paragraphs where 0 was assumed to have only two pre-images (Fig. 25).\nAlthough the fibrations differ, the underlying complex surfaces are isomorphic. This can\nbe derived from lattice theory using the discriminant form (cf. [SZ] for details).\nWe now come to base changes with ramification index (5,2,1) at 0. Again, the other cusp\n\u221e cannot have ramification index (4,2,2).

The remaining base change has ramification index\n\u221a (4,3,1)\nat both cusps, 0 and \u221e. It can only be defined over the quadratic extension Q( 2) of Q.\nWe give it below.\nWe conclude this section by collecting the four base changes which appeared above, but\nare only defined over an extension of Q. They are presented in the order of appearance in\nthe course of this section:\n\u2022 A base change with ramification indices (7,1) and (4,2,1,1) at 0 and \u221e: Let v be\na solution of 2x2 \u2212 7x + 28. Then the base change can be given by \u03c0((s : t)) =\n(s7 (s + 2vt) : (10633/4v \u2212 2401)/40 t4 (s \u2212 t)2 (s2 + (6 \u2212 2v)st/5 + (3v \u2212\u221a14)t2 /10)).\nIt realizes the configurations [1,1,2,2,4,14] and [1,2,2,4,7,8] over Q( \u22127). This\nis the minimal field of definition not only for the fibrations, but for the surfaces.\nThis follows\nfrom\u221a[S, Prop. 13.1]: The surfaces have discriminant d = 56 and 224,\n\u221a\nso Q( \u2212d) = Q( \u221214). This field has exponent 4.\n\n\u2022 The\n\u221a base change with ramification indices (6,1,1) and (4,3,1) can be defined over\nQ( \u22123). If v is a solution to 3x2 \u2212 3x + 7, then we have \u03c0((s : t)) = (s6 (s2 + 4vst \u2212\n(19v + 14)/5 t2 ) : (1763v \u2212 259)/20 t4 (s \u2212 t)3 (s \u2212 (4v \u2212 7)/5 t)). On the one hand\nwe can thereby produce the configuration [1,1,2,6,6,8]. The field of definition of\nthis fibration is the same as for the double sextic in [P, p. 313]. The other pull-back\nhas the configuration [1,2,2,3,4,12]. A fibration with this configuration has already\nbeen obtained over Q in Figure 6.\nWe will now show that these two fibrations with configuration [1,2,2,3,4,12] have\ndifferent Mordell-Weil groups: For each fibration, consider the pull-back of a primitive section of the basic rational elliptic surface X321 resp. X141 . This section can\nbe directly computed in terms of the components of the singular fibres which it\nmeets. Comparing this shape to [ATZ, Remark 0.4 (5)], we conclude that in both\ncases the induced section generates the Mordell-Weil group of the pull-back. In particular, M W of basic surface and pull-back coincide. Since M W (X321 ) = Z/2 and\nM W (X141) = Z/4, we obtain the claim.\n\u221a\nThe above fibrations over Q( \u22123) provide the first examples where a fibration\ncannot be defined over Q, although the underlying surface can. To see this, we use\nthe intersection form on the transcendental lattice and the classification of [SZ].\nBy [SZ], the configuration [1,1,2,6,6,8] implies the intersection form diag(6, 24).\nThe complex K3 surface with this form admits another elliptic fibration, No. 144\nin the notation of [SZ]. Table 2 derives this fibration over Q. Similarly, the configuration [1,2,2,3,4,12] with M W = Z/2 as above implies intersection form 12I.\nThis coincides with the intersection form of the [2,2,4,4,6,6] configuration. This\nfibration was realized over Q in Figure 8.\n\u2022 A base change with ramification index (5,2,1) at both cusps, 0 and \u221e: Let v be a\nzero of 7x3 +19x2 +16x+8. Then consider \u03c0((s : t)) = (167s5 (s\u22122t)2 (s+4(v +1) t) :\n\u2212(15v 2 + 55v + 52) t5 (4s + (3v 2 + 3v \u2212 4) t)2 (8s \u2212 (7v 2 + 15v + 4) t)). The pull-back\ngives rise to the configuration [1,2,2,4,5,10] over the extension Q(x3 \u2212 75x + 5150).\n\n\u2022 The final base change\n\u221a of this section has ramification index (4,3,1) at 0 and \u221e. It\nis defined over Q( 2). Let v be a root of 7x2 + 8x + 2. Then consider \u03c0((s : t)) =\n(24 73 s4 (s \u2212 t)3 (s + (8v + 3) t) : (8v + 3) t4 (14s + (9v + 4) t)3 (2s \u2212 (5v + 4) t)). This\nmap leads to the extremal K3 surface with singular fibres [1,2,3,4,6,8].\n\n\f22\n\n7 The non-semi-stable fibrations\n\nTogether with [TY], the previous three sections exhaust the extremal semi-stable elliptic\nK3 surfaces which can be realized as non-general pull-back of rational elliptic surfaces.\nHere the term \"general\" refers to the general pull-back construction involving the induced\nJ-map and the rational elliptic surface with singular fibres III \u2217, II, I1 . As a base change\nof degree 24 with very restricted ramification, this essentially makes no use of the basic\nrational elliptic surface. A general solution for this case has recently been announced by\nBeukers and Montanus [BM]. By construction, their fields of definition necessarily coincide\nwith ours in the overlapping cases.\n\n7\n\nThe non-semi-stable fibrations\n\nThis section is devoted to a brief analysis of the non-semi-stable extremal elliptic K3\nfibrations. We will determine all fibrations which can be derived from rational elliptic\nsurfaces. The treatment is significantly simplified by the fact that every such surface has\na non-reduced fibre. This follows from [Kl, Thm. 1.2]. Moreover, every K3 fibration with\nmore than one non-reduced fibre is easily transformed into a rational elliptic surface by the\ndeflation process described in Section 2. Such an extremal K3 surface necessarily has three\nor four cusps. In the case of three cusps, we find the K3 surfaces directly in [Ng]. If the K3\nhas four cusps, the corresponding rational elliptic surfaces is given in [H]. All but one of\nthe corresponding rational surfaces can be uniquely defined over Q up to C-isomorphism.\nExcept for three cases which are specified below, the deflation is also defined over Q.\nTable 1 collects the extremal K3 fibrations with three or four cusps. The numbering refers\nto the classification in [SZ] and will be employed throughout this section. Each fibration\ncan be derived from a rational elliptic surface by manipulating the Weierstrass equation.\nIn other words, we reobtain the rational elliptic surface by deflation.\nNo.\n113\n121\n124\n136\n137\n153\n154\n155\n167\n168\n169\n177\n178\n179\n187\n195\n196\n197\n205\n\nConfig.\n5,5,1*,1*\n2,8,1*,1*\n1,9,1*,1*\n2*,2*,2*\n4,4,2*,2*\n3,6,1*,2*\n1,8,1*,2*\n3,3,3*,3*\n2,6,1*,3*\n1,6,2*,3*\n2,2,4*,4*\n1*,1*,4*\n2,4,2*,4*\n1,1,5*,5*\n1,5,1*,5*\n2,3,1*,6*\n1,3,2*,6*\n1,2,3*,6*\n1,2,1*,8*\n\nNo.\n206\n209\n219\n220\n222\n226\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n\nConfig.\n1,1,2*,8*\n1,1,1*,9*\nIV*,IV*,IV*\n4,4,IV*,IV*\n2,4,IV*,IV*\n1,7,IV*,IV*\n4,5,1*,IV*\n2,7,1*,IV*\n1,8,1*,IV*\n2*,IV*,IV*\n3,5,2*,IV*\n1,7,2*,IV*\n2,5,3*.IV*\n1*,3*,IV*\n1,5,4*,IV*\n2,3,5*,IV*\n1,4,5*,IV*\n1,2,7,IV*\n\nNo.\n255\n256\n257\n258\n279\n280\n281\n282\n283\n284\n285\n286\n287\n288\n289\n290\n291\n292\n\nConfig.\n1,1,8*,IV*\n3,3,III*,III*\n2,4,III*,III*\n1,5,III*,III*\n0*,III*,III*\n3,5,1*,III*\n2,6,1*,III*\n1,7,1*,III*\n3,4,2*,III*\n1,6,2*,III*\n1*,2*,III*\n2,4,3*,III*\n1,5,3*,III*\n2,3,4*,III*\n1,3,5*,III*\n1,2,6*,III*\n1,1,7*,III*\n3,4,III*,IV*\n\nNo.\n293\n294\n295\n296\n297\n313\n314\n315\n316\n317\n318\n319\n320\n321\n322\n323\n324\n325\n\nConfig.\n2,5,III*,IV*\n1,6,III*,IV*\n1*,III*,IV*\n2,2 II*,II*\nIV,II*,II*\n1*,1*,II*\n2,5,1*,II*\n1,6,1*,II*\n3,3,2*,II*\n1,5,2*,II*\n2,3,3*,II*\n1,2,5*,II*\n1,1,6*,II*\n2,4,II*,IV*\n1,5,II*,IV*\n0*,II*,IV*\n2,3,II*,III*\n1,4,II*,III*\n\nTab. 1: The extremal K3 fibrations with three or four cusps\nThere are four K3 fibrations in the above table which cannot be defined over Q by this\napproach. For three of them, the basic rational elliptic surfaces nevertheless is defined\nover Q. However, since it has cusps which are conjugate in some quadratic field, certain\nmanipulations are not defined over Q. As a result, for the fibrations\nwith\n\u221a\n\u221a No. 187, No.\n\u221a 245\nand No. 282, fields of definition can only be given as Q( 5), Q( \u22122), and Q( \u22127),\n\n\f7 The non-semi-stable fibrations\n\n23\n\nrespectively. The\n\u221a rational elliptic surface which corresponds to No. 294 can itself only be\ndefined over Q( \u22123).\nFor these four fibrations, we shall briefly discuss whether the underlying K3 surface can\nbe defined over Q. This is possible for No. 187, 245, and 294: Again we use the intersection form on the transcendental lattice, as determined in [SZ]. This gives respective\nisomorphisms with the following surfaces: No. 259 from Table 2, No. 33 from Figure 7, and\nNo. 84 from Figure 6 (which has M W = Z/4). On the other hand, the surface admitting\nconfiguration\u221aNo. 282 cannot be defined over Q by [S, Prop. 13.1]. Hence the field of\ndefinition Q( \u22127) is minimal.\nWe now come to the extremal K3 fibrations which are still missing with respect to the\nclassification in [SZ]. These have exactly one non-reduced fibre. We will derive half of\nthem from rational elliptic surfaces. We will apply base change and further make use of\nthe \"transfer of *\" as explained in [M2]. Essentially this just moves the * from one fibre\nto another (a priori not necessarily singular). This can be achieved by translating the\ncommon factor of the polynomials A and B in the Weierstrass equation. We will take base\nchanges of degree 2 to 6 into account, depending on the singular fibres of the basic rational\nelliptic surface. For each degree, we are going to exploit one example in more detail. The\nremaining fibrations will only be sketched very roughly.\nDegree 2: These base changes involve the rational elliptic surfaces with four singular\nfibres, which have one fibre of type III. For example, take the surface Y with singular\nfibres I1 , I3 , I5 , III. According to [H], this surface and all its cusps can be defined over\nQ. Consider a quadratic base change \u03c0 of P1 which is ramified at the cusp of the IIIfibre and at one further cusp. The pull-back of Y via \u03c0 is a K3 surface over Q with\nfive semi-stable singular fibres and one of type I0\u2217 . Transferring the * gives rise to three\nextremal K3 surfaces with one non-reduced and four semi-stable fibres. For instance,\nthe configuration [2,3,3,5,5,0*] can be transformed to [3,3,5,5,2*] (No. 138), [2,3,5,5,3*]\n(No. 157) or [2,3,3,5,5*] (No. 180).\nDegree 3: Let Y = X141 , X222 or X411 as defined in Section 4. After deflation, any base\nchange of degree 3 gives a K3 surface. This is extremal if and only if the base change is\nonly ramified at the three cusps (i.e. the cusps have 5 pre-images in total). We will refer\nto the possible base changes as triple covers without specifying the particular one. They\nare all defined over Q.\nDegree 4: Consider X431 as introduced in Section 5. We want to apply a base change of\ndegree 4. This gives an extremal K3 fibration, if we select the ramification index (3,1) at\nthe cusp of the IV \u2217 -fibre and minimize the number of pre-images of the other two cusps at\n4. In fact, we can adequately choose both base changes \u03c02 and \u03c04 from the third section\nafter exchanging cusps. The third useful base change has ramification index (3,1) at every\ncusp. It can be given by\n\u03c03 ((s : t)) = (s3 (s \u2212 2t) : t3 (t \u2212 2s)).\nThis base change, for instance, gives rise to the constellation [1,3,3,9,IV*] (No. 233).\nDegree 5: For the base changes of the next two paragraphs, the basic rational elliptic\nsurface will be X321 (defined in Section 6). A base change of degree 5 with ramification\nindex (2,2,1) at 1 (the cusp of III \u2217) leads to a K3 surface. After deflation, only one III \u2217\nremains in the pull-back. The resulting K3 fibrations is extremal if and only if the other\ntwo cusps have the minimal number of 4 pre-images. There are five such base changes,\nall but one defined over Q. We will only go into detail for one of them and then list the\nothers:\n\u2022 The first base change can be given by\n\u03c0E ((s : t)) = (s(s2 \u2212 5st + 5t2 )2 : 4t5 ),\nsince s(s2 \u2212 5st + 5t2 )2 \u2212 4t5 = (s \u2212 4t)(s2 \u2212 3ts + t2 )2 . As pull-back we realize\n[2,4,4,5,III*] (No. 259) and [1,2,2,10,III*] (No. 275).\n\n\f24\n\n7 The non-semi-stable fibrations\n\n\u2022 \u03c0F ((s : t)) = (4s3 (3s \u2212 5t)2 : t4 (15s + 2t)).\n\u2022 \u03c0G ((s : t)) = (s3 (4s \u2212 5t)2 : t3 (4t \u2212 5s)2 ).\n\u2022 \u03c0H ((s : t)) = (64t5 : (t \u2212 s)3 (9s2 \u2212 33st + 64t2 )).\n\u2022 \u03c0I ((s : t)) = (s4 (s \u2212 5t) : t4 (2i \u2212 11)(5s + (3 + 4i)t) with i2 = \u22121.\nDegree 6: Consider a base change of degree 6 with ramification index (2,2,2) at 1. We\napply this base change to X321 . After deflation and transfer of *, we obtain an elliptic\nK3 surface whose singular fibres sit above the pre-images of the other two cusps 0 and\n\u221e. Restricting their number to the minimum 5, we achieve an extremal K3 fibration.\nThe transfer of * turns a distinct semi-stable fibre In into its non-reduced relative of type\nIn\u2217 . Choosing different In , one base change gives rise to at most 9 different fibrations.\nThere are six base changes with the above properties. We give the three maps without\nfactorization:\n\u2022 \u03c0A ((s : t)) = (4(s2 \u2212 4st + t2 )3 : 27t4 s(s \u2212 4t)) or alternatively\n\u2032\n\u03c0A\n((s : t)) = (4s3 (s \u2212 2t)3 : t4 (3s2 \u2212 6st \u2212 t2 )).\n\u2022 \u03c0B ((s : t)) = (\u22124t5 (6s + t) : s3 (2s \u2212 5t)2 (s \u2212 4t)).\n\u2022 \u03c0C ((s : t)) = (\u2212s4 (s2 + 2st + 5t2 ) : 4t5 (t \u2212 2s)).\nLet us mention one particular example in more detail: We want to realize the configuration\n[1,2,3,10,2*] (No. 148). This can be achieved as pull-back from X321 via the base change\n\u03c0B . Here we need ramification index (3,2,1) at the I1 -fibre and (5,1) at the I2 . The\nremarkable point about this construction is that we still have a choice of where to move\nthe * after the pull-back: We can transfer it either to the I2 at 5/2 which sits above the\noriginal I1 , or to the I2 over \u22121/6 which comes from the I2 -fibre of X321 . Using lattice\ntheory, one can easily show that the resulting two complex surfaces are not isomorphic.\nThis is the only example where there is such an ambiguity concerning the transfer of *.\nWe are now in the position to compute all the remaining extremal elliptic K3 fibrations\nwhich can be derived from rational elliptic surfaces by our simple methods. The following\ntable collects their configurations together with the number at which they appear in [SZ].\nWe further\nadd\n\u0013 the Mordell-Weil group M W and the reduced coefficients of the intersection\n\u0012\na b\non the transcendental lattice which determine the isomorphism class of the\nform\nb c\nsurface (up to orientation if there is ambiguity in the sign of b). The right-hand part of\nthe table gives a very brief description of the construction and the field of definition for\nthe fibration. For shortness we will indicate the occurrence of a transfer of * only by a *\nin the description of the construction. We will not mention deflation.\nNo.\n114\n115\n116\n117\n122\n123\n127\n128\n129\n132\n133\n135\n138\n139\n140\n\nConfig.\n1,4,6,6,1*\n1,5,5,6,1*\n2,4,5,6,1*\n1,2,7,7,1*\n2,3,4,8,1*\n2,2,5,8,1*\n1,3,3,10,1*\n2,2,3,10,1*\n1,2,4,10,1*\n1,2,2,12,1*\n1,1,3,12,1*\n1,1,1,14,1*\n3,3,5,5,2*\n2,2,6,6,2*\n2,4,4,6,2*\n\nMW\nZ/2\n0\nZ/2\n0\nZ/4\nZ/2\n0\nZ/2\nZ/2\nZ/4\nZ/2\n0\n0\nZ/2

fibrations\n\n26\n\nNote that No. 135 and 201 are fibrations on the same complex surface as No. 282 and the\nsemi-stable fibration with configuration [1,1,2,2,4,14] from Section 6.\u221a Since this surface\ncannot be defined over Q by [S, Prop. 13.1], the field of definition Q( \u22127) is minimal.\nTable 2 completes the treatment of extremal elliptic K3 fibrations which can be derived\nfrom rational elliptic surfaces by direct manipulation of the Weierstrass equation or as\npull-back via a non-general base change. We would like to finish this section with the\nfollowing remark. It concerns K3 surfaces which possess an extremal elliptic fibration\nwith non-trivial Mordell-Weil group. For every such surface, this paper (combined with\n[TY]) gives at least one explicit extremal fibration which is obtained as pull-back from a\nrational elliptic surface. This result might be compared to the idea of elementary fibrations\nproposed in [MP3, section 6]. We should, however, point out that our pull-backs can in\ngeneral not be called elementary in the strict sense of [P],[MP3].\n\nAcknowledgement: I am indepted to K.
