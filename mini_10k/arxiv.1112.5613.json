Introduction\nThe characterization of a class of Young measures generated by constrained sequences\nis a recurring problem in Young measure theory with many applications in the analysis of\nnonlinear PDEs and the Calculus of Variations. The first major results in this field are due\nto Kinderlehrer & Pedregal [10, 11, 20] and concern sequences of gradients bounded in W1,p\nwith 1 < p \u2264 \u221e (and also for p = 1 if one additionally assumes equiintegrability). Their\ncharacterization puts the generated \"gradient\" Young measures in duality with quasiconvex\nfunctions with p-growth (quasiconvex functions were introduced by Morrey [18], for a modern\nintroduction see Dacorogna's book [6]). Some ideas also go back to Tartar's lecture notes [26]\nand the investigations into microstructure by Ball & James [4]. For further related results\nsee [9, 13, 16, 24, 25].\nPart of the interest in Young measure characterization theorems in the spirit of Kinderlehrer & Pedregal stems from the fact that they reveal a duality to the (generalized) convexity\nclass relevant in the corresponding minimization problems. Indeed, the \"necessity\" direction\nof such a characterization result is equivalent to (sequential) weak lower semicontinuity of\nintegral functionals with integrands in the corresponding convexity class. On the other hand,\nthe \"sufficiency\" direction is interesting for instance in relaxation theory, cf. [20]: If a given\nvariational problem has no classical solution, one may extend the class of admissible minimizers to include Young measures, which are to be interpreted as fine mixtures of functions.\nThe characterization result then implies constraints on the class of relaxed minimizers to be\nconsidered. In the final Section 6 we also give another interesting new application to the\nsplitting of generating sequences for generalized gradient Young measure with an \"atomic\"\npart.\nThis work considers Young measures related to the space BV of functions of bounded\nvariation (see the following section for definitions). Owing to the possible presence of concentration effects, sequences from these spaces are not amenable to a treatment with classical\nYoung measures. A remedy in the form of generalized Young measures was introduced by\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\nDiPerna and Majda [7] in the context of fluid dynamics. We here follow the Young measure\nframework of [2, 14, 22]; for a recent overview and historical remarks see [21].\nThe first characterization theorem for Young measures generated by sequences in BV\nwas presented in [14] and its proof was based on the BV-lower semicontinuity theorem\nin [15], which was established without Young measure theory. The lower semicontinuity or\n\"necessity\" part of that characterization theorem was later also proved directly and without\nthe use of Alberti's Rank One Theorem [1] in [23].\nThe aim of this work is two-fold: First, a cleaner proof of the \"sufficiency\" part of the\nBV-Young measure characterization theorem is presented. In particular, the argument in\nthis work is self-contained within the framework of generalized Young measures and does\nnot rely on a relaxation theorem such as [15]. Moreover, it is conceptually much simpler and\nmore satisfying than the previous proof. In the course of the argument, we also introduce\nthe new concept of homogeneous generalized Young measures, which exhibits a number of\ndifferences to the concept of classical homogeneous Young measures, as well as novel spaces\nof \"local\" Young measures (separately for regular and singular points), which should prove\nto be useful in related problems as well. Second, we show how the characterization theorem\nin BV can be used to prove a natural conjecture about gradient Young measures with an\natomic part.\nIn all of the following, \u03a9 is an open bounded Lipschitz domain. The main result in BV\nis (see the following section for notation):\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) be a (generalized) Young measure with \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0.\nThen \u03bd is a gradient Young measure, \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm ), if and only if there exists u \u2208\nBV(\u03a9; Rm ) with\n[\u03bd] := hid, \u03bdx i Ldx\n\n\u03a9 + hid, \u03bdx\u221e i \u03bb\u03bd (dx) = Du,\n\nand for all quasiconvex h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ) with linear growth at infinity the following two Jensentype inequalities hold:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03bb\u03bd\nd\u03bb\u03bd\n(i)\nh id, \u03bdx + id, \u03bdx\u221e\n(x)\n\u2264 h, \u03bdx + h# , \u03bdx\u221e\n(x)\ndLd\ndLd\nfor Ld -almost every x \u2208 \u03a9, and\n\u0001\n(ii)\nh# id, \u03bdx\u221e \u2264 h# , \u03bdx\u221e\nfor \u03bbs\u03bd -almost every x \u2208 \u03a9.\n\nHere, h# is the generalized recession function as defined in (2.3).\nWe remark that by a recent result of Kirchheim and Kristensen [12] in conjunction with\nAlberti's Rank One Theorem [1], condition (ii) is always satisfied, see Remark 5.1 for details.\nBy Theorem 5.4 of [23], the \"necessity\" or lower semicontinuity part of the characterization result holds true; in this context note that due to the goal of avoiding Alberti's Rank\nOne Theorem [1], the work [23] established the classical lower semicontinuity theorem only\nunder the additional assumption that the strong recession function exists (see Remark 5.6\nin loc. cit. for an explanation why this is optimal), but the above Jensen-type inequalities\nwere indeed shown for general quasiconvex functions with linear growth. It remains to show\nthe \"sufficiency\" part of the previous theorem, i.e. we need to prove:\nProposition 1.2. Let \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) be a Young measure with \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0 such that\nthere exists u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) with [\u03bd] = Du, and such that for all quasiconvex h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d )\nwith linear growth at infinity the Jensen-type inequalities (i) and (ii) from the preceding\ntheorem hold. Then, \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ).\n\n\fYOUNG MEASURE CHARACTERIZATION IN BV\n\n3\n\nIn contrast to the proof strategy in [14] we here rely on a local approach, i.e. we consider\nblow-ups of Young measures in the form of tangent Young measures as introduced in [23]\n(we use the newer, slightly streamlined versions of the localization principles from [21]),\nsee the pivotal Propositions 2.7, 2.8 for the precise formulation involving \"tangent Young\nmeasures\". This strategy is somewhat reminiscent of the one employed by Kinderlehrer &\nPedregal [10], which proceeds by reduction to the case of \"homogeneous\" Young measures\nand a geometric Hahn\u2013Banach argument. Owing to the more complex fine structure of BVfunctions as opposed to W 1,1 -functions, the present proof of course requires additional ideas.\nIn particular, the local arguments differ at \"regular\" and \"singular\" points. At the latter\npoints we need to employ Alberti's Rank-One Theorem [1] to infer that the local structure of\nthe tangent Young measures is sufficiently constrained (this use of Alberti's theorem seems\nto be a genuine requirement and Alberti's theorem cannot be replaced by a rigidity lemma\nas in [23]). After the \"local characterization\" is complete and we have obtained generating\nsequences (consisting of gradients) for all tangent Young measures, we glue these sequences\ntogether in order to construct a sequence of gradients generating the Young measure we\nstarted with. In all of these arguments we rely heavily on the machinery for generalized\nYoung measures developed in [14, 21\u201323].\nThe paper is organized as follows: After recalling basic facts, in particular about generalized Young measures, in Section 2, we start by showing a local version of the BV-Young\nmeasure characterization at regular points in Section 3 and then at singular points in Section 4. With these local results at hand, we prove Theorem 1.1 in Section 5. The final\nSection 6 closes the paper with the aforementioned application of the characterization result\nto the splitting of generating sequences.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank Jan Kristensen for many stimulating discussions and for\nreading a preliminary version of the manuscript.

Setup\nd\n\nWe define the balls B(x, r) := x + rB (r > 0), where Bd is the unit ball, and analogously\nthe cubes Q(x, r) := x + rQ, where Q is a (possibly rotated) unit cube. The standard unit\ncube is denoted by Q(0, 1) := (\u22121/2, 1/2)d, Sd\u22121 is the unit sphere in Rd and \u03c9d = |Bd | is\nthe volume of Bd . The matrix space Rm\u00d7d will always be equipped with the Frobenius norm\n(the Euclidean norm in Rmd ), its unit ball and sphere are Bm\u00d7d and \u2202Bm\u00d7d , respectively.\nIn all of the following, \u03a9 \u2282 Rd denotes an open bounded Lipschitz domain.\n2.1. BV-functions and quasiconvexity. A function u \u2208 L1 (\u03a9; Rm ) is said to be a function of bounded variation, u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ), if its distributional derivative Du can be represented as a finite Rm\u00d7d -valued Radon measure carried by \u03a9. The space BV is a non-reflexive\nBanach space under the norm kukBV := kukL1 + |Du|(\u03a9), where |Du| is the total variation\nmeasure of Du. We will often use the Lebesgue\u2013Radon\u2013Nikod\u00fdm decomposition\nDu = \u2207u Ld\ns\n\n\u03a9 + Ds u = \u2207u Ld\n\n\u03a9+\n\ndDs u\n|Ds u|,\nd|Ds u|\n\ndD u\n1\ns\nm\u00d7d\nwhere d|D\n) is the polar function of Ds u, i.e. the Radon\u2013Nikod\u00fdm\ns u| \u2208 L (\u03a9, |D u|; \u2202B\ns\nderivative of D u with respect to its total variation measure |Ds u|. Boundedness in norm\nof a sequence (uj ) \u2282 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) entails weak* (sequential) compactness, i.e. one can find a\n\u2217\nsubsequence (here, like in the following, not relabeled) uj \u21c1 u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ), meaning that\n\n\f4\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\u2217\n\nuj \u2192 u strongly in L1 (\u03a9; Rm ) and Duj \u21c1 Du in the sense of Radon measures. For further\ninformation on the space BV and its properties we refer to [3], other references are [8, 27].\nStarting with Morrey's work [18], the natural notion of convexity for minimization problems involving gradients has long been known to be that of quasiconvexity. A locally bounded\nBorel function f : Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R is said to be quasiconvex if\nZ\nd\nm\nm\u00d7d\n.\nf (A) \u2264 \u2212 f (A + \u2207\u03c8(y)) dy\nfor all \u03c8 \u2208 C\u221e\nc (B ; R ) and all A \u2208 R\nBd\n\nIt can be shown that in this definition one may replace Bd by any bounded open Lipschitz\ndomain and the space C\u221e by W1,\u221e without changing the definition of quasiconvexity. More\nabout this fundamental class of functions can be found in the book [6]. We also define the\nquasiconvex envelope Qh : Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R \u222a {\u2212\u221e} of a continuous function h : Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R to be\nthe largest quasiconvex function less than or equal to h (possibly identically \u2212\u221e if no such\nfunction exists). Then, one can show that\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\n\u221e\nd\nm\nQh(A) = inf \u2212 h(A + \u2207\u03c8(y)) dy : \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (B ; R ) ,\n(2.1)\nBd\n\nwhich is itself a quasiconvex function or identically \u2212\u221e, see Section 6.3 in [6] and the\nappendix of [10].\n\n2.2. Young measures. This section gives a brief overview of the basic theory of generalized\nYoung measures and recalls results that will be used later. We follow [14,22,23], also see [21]\nfor a more comprehensive introduction.\nFirst, we need a suitable class of integrands: Let E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) be the set of all f \u2208\nC(\u03a9 \u00d7 Rm\u00d7d ) such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00c2\n(Sf )(x, \u00c2) := (1 \u2212 |\u00c2|) f x,\n,\nx \u2208 \u03a9, \u00c2 \u2208 Bm\u00d7d\n(2.2)\n1 \u2212 |\u00c2|\nextends into a continuous function Sf \u2208 C(\u03a9 \u00d7 Bm\u00d7d ). In particular, this implies that f\nhas linear growth at infinity, i.e. with M := kf kE(\u03a9;Rm\u00d7d) := kSf : \u03a9 \u00d7 Bm\u00d7d k\u221e ,\n|f (x, A)| \u2264 M (1 + |A|)\n\nfor all (x, A) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 Rm\u00d7d .\n\nFor all f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) the (strong) recession function\nf \u221e (x, A) := \u2032lim\n\nx \u2192x\nA\u2032 \u2192A\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nf (x\u2032 , tA\u2032 )\n,\nt\n\nx \u2208 \u03a9, A \u2208 Rm\u00d7d ,\n\nexists as a continuous function. Sometimes this notion of a recession function is too strong\nand so for any function h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ) with linear growth at infinity we define the generalized recession function\nh(tA\u2032 )\n,\nx \u2208 \u03a9, A \u2208 Rm\u00d7d .\nh# (A) := lim sup\n(2.3)\n\u2032\nt\nA \u2192A\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nWe remark that for both flavors of recession function one can drop the additional sequence\nA\u2032 \u2192 A if the integrand in question is Lipschitz continuous (which will be the case for all\nintegrands h in this work for which we consider h# ).\nDefinition 2.1. A (generalized) Young measure with target space Rm\u00d7d is a triple\n\u03bd = (\u03bdx , \u03bb\u03bd , \u03bdx\u221e ) comprising\n(i) a parametrized family of probability measures (\u03bdx )x\u2208\u03a9 \u2282 M1 (Rm\u00d7d ),\n(ii) a positive finite measure \u03bb\u03bd \u2208 M+ (\u03a9) and\n(iii) a parametrized family of probability measures (\u03bdx\u221e )x\u2208\u03a9 \u2282 M1 (\u2202Bm\u00d7d ) (recall that\n\u2202Bm\u00d7d contains all matrices A \u2208 Rm\u00d7d with |A| = 1).\nMoreover, we assume that \u03bd has the following properties:\n\n\fYOUNG MEASURE CHARACTERIZATION IN BV\n\n5\n\n(iv) the map x 7\u2192 \u03bdx is weakly* measurable with respect to Ld , i.e. the function x 7\u2192\nhf (x, q), \u03bdx i is Ld -measurable for all bounded Borel functions f : \u03a9 \u00d7 Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R\n(here h q, qi is the Riesz duality pairing between continuous functions and measures),\n(v) the map x 7\u2192 \u03bdx\u221e is weakly* measurable with respect to \u03bb\u03bd , and\n(vi) x 7\u2192 h| q|, \u03bdx i \u2208 L1 (\u03a9).\nWe collect all such Young measures \u03bd in the set Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ). The parametrized measure (\u03bdx )\nis called the oscillation measure, the measure \u03bb\u03bd is the concentration measure, and\n(\u03bdx\u221e ) is the concentration-angle measure; this terminology is illustrated in [14] and [21].\nThe duality product hhf, \u03bdii for f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) and \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) is defined via\nZ\nZ\nf \u221e (x, q), \u03bdx\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd (x)\nf, \u03bd :=\nf (x, q), \u03bdx dx +\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\nZ Z\nZ Z\nf \u221e (x, A) d\u03bdx\u221e (A) d\u03bb\u03bd (x).\nf (x, A) d\u03bdx (A) dx +\n:=\n\u03a9\n\nRm\u00d7d\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u2202Bm\u00d7d\n\nOne can see easily that hh q, \u03bdii for \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) defines a linear and bounded functional\non the Banach space E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ). Hence, via hh q, qii, a Young measure can be considered\na part of the dual space E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\u2217 . This embedding gives rise to a weak* topology on\nY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) and so we say that (\u03bdj ) \u2282 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) weakly* converges to \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ),\n\u2217\nin symbols \u03bdj \u21c1 \u03bd, if hhf, \u03bdj ii \u2192 hhf, \u03bdii for all f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ).\nThe main compactness result in the space Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) states that if (\u03bdj ) \u2282 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\nis a sequence of Young measures such that\nsupj\n\n1 \u2297 | q|, \u03bdj < \u221e,\n\nwhere\n\n(1 \u2297 | q|)(x, A) = |A|,\n\nthen (\u03bdj ) is weakly* sequentially relatively compact in Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ), i.e. there exists a sub\u2217\nsequence (not relabeled) such that \u03bdj \u21c1 \u03bd for some \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ). It can also be shown\nthat the set Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) is topologically weakly*-closed (as a subset of E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\u2217 ).\nAnother important notion is that of the barycenter\n[\u03bd] := id, \u03bdx Ldx\n\n\u03a9 + id, \u03bdx\u221e \u03bb\u03bd (dx)\n\n\u2208 M(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\n\nof a Young measure \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ); the barycenter is a matrix-valued Radon measure.\nThe following technical lemma is often useful (a proof of this can be found in the aforementioned references):\nLemma 2.2. There exists a countable set of functions {fk } = { \u03c6k \u2297 hk : k \u2208 N } \u2282\nE(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ), where \u03c6k \u2208 C(\u03a9) and hk \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ), such that hhfk , \u03bd1 ii = hhfk , \u03bd2 ii for\n\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) and all k \u2208 N implies \u03bd1 = \u03bd2 . Moreover, all the hk can be chosen to\nbe Lipschitz continuous and we may also require that every hk is either compactly supported\nin Rm\u00d7d or positively 1-homogeneous.\nNext, we define the set GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) of gradient Young measures as the collection\nof the Young measures \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) with the property that there exists a norm-bounded\nsequence (uj ) \u2282 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) such that the sequence (Duj ) generates \u03bd, which in symbols\nY\n\nwe will write as Duj \u2192 \u03bd, meaning that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\ndDs uj\n\u221e\nd|Ds uj |(x)\nx,\nf (x, \u2207uj (x)) dx +\nf\nd|Ds uj |\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\n\u2192\n\nf, \u03bd\n\nfor all f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ).\nThe following lemma will be used frequently:\n\nLemma 2.3. Let \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) satisfy \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0. Then, there exists a generating\nY\nsequence (uj ) \u2282 (W1,1 \u2229C\u221e )(\u03a9; Rm ) with Duj \u2192 \u03bd and uj |\u2202\u03a9 = u|\u2202\u03a9 , where u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm )\nis an arbitrary underlying deformation of \u03bd, that is, u satisfies [\u03bd] \u03a9 = Du.\n\n\f6\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\nNext, we recall ways to manipulate (gradient) Young measures. These results encapsulate the basic operations that are customarily performed on sequences in the Calculus of\nVariations, see [14, 21] for proofs.\nProposition 2.4 (Averaging). Let \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) satisfy \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0. Also, assume\nthat [\u03bd] = Du for a function u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) satisfying one of the following two properties:\n(i) u agrees with an affine function on the boundary \u2202\u03a9 or\n(ii) \u03a9 is a cuboid with one face normal \u03be \u2208 Sd\u22121 and one (hence every) underlying\ndeformation of \u03bd is \u03be-directional.\nThen, there exists a Young measure \u03bd\u0304 \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) acting on f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) as\nZ Z\n\u2212 f (x, q), \u03bdy dy dx\nf, \u03bd\u0304 =\n\u03a9\n\n+\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03bb\u03bd (\u03a9)\n|\u03a9|\n\nZ Z\n\u2212 f \u221e (x, q), \u03bdy\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd (y) dx.\n\u03a9\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u03a9\n\nMore precisely:\n(1) The oscillation measure (\u03bd\u0304x )x is Ld -essentially constant in x and for all h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d )\nwith linear growth at infinity it holds that\nZ\na.e.\nh, \u03bd\u0304x = \u2212 h, \u03bdy dy\n\u03a9\n\n(2) The concentration measure \u03bb\u03bd\u0304 is a multiple of Lebesgue measure, \u03bb\u03bd\u0304 = \u03b1Ld \u03a9,\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03bb\u03bd (\u03a9)/|\u03a9|.\n(3) The concentration-angle measure (\u03bd\u0304x\u221e )x is Ld -essentially (\u03bb\u03bd\u0304 -essentially) constant\nand for all h\u221e \u2208 C(\u2202Bm\u00d7d ) it holds that\nZ\na.e.\nh\u221e , \u03bd\u0304x\u221e = \u2212 h\u221e , \u03bdy\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd (y)\n\u03a9\n\nHere, the \u03be-directionality of an underlying deformation u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ), i.e. [\u03bd] = Du,\nmeans that u(x) = v(x * \u03be) with v \u2208 BV(R; Rm ). The proof of case (i) is contained in\nProposition 7 of [14], the proof of (ii) is similar, but requires an additional standard staircase\nconstruction.\nApplying the averaging principle to a fixed function (or, more precisely, an elementary\nYoung measure) yields the following corollary, which we here give in the slightly extended\nform with a different domain to be covered.\nCorollary 2.5 (Generalized Riemann\u2013Lebesgue Lemma). Let u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) that\nagrees with an affine function on \u2202\u03a9. Then, for every open bounded Lipschitz domain\nD \u2282 Rd there exists \u03bd \u2208 GY(D; Rm\u00d7d ) that acts on f \u2208 E(D; Rm\u00d7d ) as\nZ Z\nf, \u03bd =\n\u2212 f (x, \u2207u(y)) dy dx\nD \u03a9\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ Z\n|Ds u|(\u03a9)\ndDs u\n\u221e\n+\n(y) d|Ds u|(y) dx.\n\u2212 f\nx,\n|\u03a9|\nd|Ds u|\nD \u03a9\nMoreover, \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0.\nWe will also need the following approximation result:\nProposition 2.6 (Approximation). Let \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) satisfy \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0. Also,\nassume that [\u03bd] = Du for a function u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) satisfying one of the conditions (i),\n(ii) from Proposition 2.4. Then, for all k \u2208 N, there exists a partition (Ckl )l of (Ld + \u03bb\u03bd )almost all of \u03a9 into open sets Ckl , l = 1, . . . , N (k), with diameters at most 1/k and (Ld +\n\n\fYOUNG MEASURE CHARACTERIZATION IN BV\n\n7\n\n\u03bb\u03bd )(\u2202Ckl ) = 0, and a sequence of Young measures (\u03bdk ) \u2282 GY(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) such that\n\u2217\n\n\u03bdk \u21c1 \u03bd\n\nin Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\n\nas k \u2192 \u221e\n\nand for every f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\nN (k)\n\nf, \u03bdk\n\n=\n\nX\n\nf, \u03bd\n\nCkl\n\nl=1\n\n=\n\nN (k) Z\n\nX\nl=1\n\nCkl\n\nZ\n\u2212\n\nf (x, q), \u03bdy dy dx\n\nCkl\n\nN (k)\n\nZ\nX \u03bb\u03bd (Ckl ) Z\n\u2212 f \u221e (x, q), \u03bdy\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd (y) dx,\n+\n|Ckl | Ckl Ckl\nl=1\n\nwhere \u03bd\n\nCkl designates the averaged Young measures to \u03bd\n\nCkl as in Proposition 2.4.\n\nFor the statements of the following propositions we first introduce local (gradient)\nYoung measures \u03bd \u2208 [G]Yloc (Rd ; Rm\u00d7d ), which are defined on all of Rd and whose restrictions to any relatively compact set U \u2282 Rd lie in [G]Y(U ; Rm\u00d7d ). We will also use the\nnotion of tangent measures, see [21] or Chapter 14 of [17] for this. Suffice it to say here that\na tangent measure \u03c4 \u2208 Mloc (Rd ) to a Radon measure \u03bc \u2208 Mloc (Rd ) at the point x0 \u2208 Rd\n(x ,r )\nis any (local) weak* limit of the pushforward measures cn T\u2217 0 n \u03bc := cn \u03bc(x0 + rn q), where\nT (x0 ,rn ) (x) := (x \u2212 x0 )/rn and cn > 0, rn \u2193 0 are sequences of arbitrary (normalization)\nconstants and scaling radii, respectively. Tangent measures are in general not unique and are\ncollected in the set Tan(\u03bc, x0 ). The works [22, 23] extended this concept to Young measures\nand established the following localization principle:\nProposition 2.7 (Localization at regular points). Let \u03bd \u2208 [G]Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) be a (gradient) Young measure. Then, for Ld -almost every x0 \u2208 \u03a9 there exists a regular (gradient)\ntangent Young measure \u03c3 \u2208 [G]Yloc (Rd ; Rm\u00d7d ) satisfying\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd\n[\u03c3] = id, \u03bdx0 + id, \u03bdx0\n(x0 ) Ld \u2208 Tan([\u03bd], x0 ),\n\u03c3y = \u03bdx0 a.e.,\ndLd\nd\u03bb\u03bd\n(x0 ) Ld \u2208 Tan(\u03bb\u03bd , x0 ),\n\u03c3y\u221e = \u03bdx\u221e0 a.e.\n\u03bb\u03c3 =\ndLd\nTo illustrate this result and why it facilitates the term \"tangent Young measure\", we\nremark that at regular points x0 there exists a sequence (\u03c3 (rn ) ) \u2208 [G]Y(Rd ; Rm\u00d7d ), where\nrn \u2193 0, with\nEE\n1 DD \u0010 q \u2212 x0 \u0011\n\u03c6 \u2297 h, \u03c3 (rn ) = d \u03c6\n\u2297 h, \u03bd ,\n\u03c6 \u2297 h \u2208 E(Bd ; Rm\u00d7d ),\nrn\nrn\n\u2217\n\nand such that \u03c3 (rn ) \u21c1 \u03c3. Thus, \u03c3 indeed originates from a blow-up construction.\nCarrying out a similar procedure for singular points, we observe that the resulting singular\ntangent Young measures \u03c3 \u2208 Yloc (Rd ; Rm\u00d7d ) always have the property that \u03c3y = \u03b40 almost\neverywhere (see Section 3.3 of [21]). This suggests the following definitions:\n\b\nEsing (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) := f \u2208 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) : f (x, q) positively 1-homogeneous, x \u2208 \u03a9 ,\n(2.5)\n\b\nYsing (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) := \u03bd = (\u03bdx , \u03bb\u03bd , \u03bdx\u221e ) \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) : \u03bdx = \u03b40 a.e. .\n(2.6)\nThe definition of Ysing (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) in particular entails that (ii), (iii), (v) from Definition 2.1\nhold.

Since clearly\n\n\f8\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\nYsing (\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) \u2282 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ), all results for Young measures also hold for their singular counterparts.

We omit the proof since the result follows immediately\nfrom the singular localization principle in Section 3.3 of [21] or [22].\n3. Local characterization I: Regular points\nWe first prove a local version of our characterization theorem in BV at regular points, that\nis for Young measures originating from the regular localization procedure of Proposition 2.7.\nThis proof is based on the same principles as the one for classical Young measures in [10,11].\nWe still expose it in some detail here for the sake of completeness and also to give an overview\nof the general strategy, which will also be employed for singular points.

Let \u03c3 \u2208 Yreg (A0 ) for some A0 \u2208 Rm\u00d7d . If \u03c3 satisfies the regular\nJensen-type inequality\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03bb\u03c3\nd\u03bb\u03c3\n(y)\n\u2264 h, \u03c3y + h# , \u03c3y\u221e\n(y)\n(3.1)\nh(A0 ) = h id, \u03c3y + id, \u03c3y\u221e\ndLd\ndLd\nfor all quasiconvex h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ) with linear growth at infinity, then \u03c3 \u2208 GYreg (A0 ).\nProof. Step 1. From Lemma 3.1 we know that the set GYreg (A0 ) is weakly*-closed and\nconvex (considered as a subset of (Ereg )\u2217 ). By the Hahn\u2013Banach Theorem we therefore only\nneed to show that for every weakly*-closed affine half-space H in (Ereg )\u2217 with GY reg (A0 ) \u2282\nH, it holds that \u03c3 \u2208 H. Fix such a half-space H and observe that since H is weakly*-closed,\nthere exists a weakly* continuous functional GH \u2208 (Ereg )\u2217\u2217 and \u03ba \u2208 R such that\n\b\nH = e\u2217 \u2208 (Ereg )\u2217 : GH (e\u2217 ) \u2265 \u03ba .\nFrom standard arguments in Functional Analysis, see for example Theorem V.1.3 in [5],\nwe may infer that GH is an evaluation functional, GH (e\u2217 ) = e\u2217 (fH ) for an fH \u2208 Ereg . In\nparticular, as GY reg (A0 ) \u2282 H, we have\nfH , \u03bc \u2265 \u03ba\n\nfor all \u03bc \u2208 GYreg (A0 ).\n\nIn the remainder of the proof we will show hhfH , \u03c3ii \u2265 \u03ba, whereby \u03c3 \u2208 H.\nStep 2. Let \u03b5 > 0. For\ng\u03b5 (A) := fH (A) + \u03b5|A|,\n\nA \u2208 Rm\u00d7d ,\n\nwe immediately see g\u03b5 \u2208 Ereg . Next, we observe that QfH (A0 ) > \u2212\u221e, where QfH is\n1,\u221e\nthe quasiconvex envelope of fH . Otherwise, there would exist w \u2208 WA\n(Bd ; Rm ), that is\n0x\nw \u2208 W1,\u221e (Bd ; Rm ) and w(x) = A0 x for all x \u2208 \u2202Bd , such that\nZ\nfH (\u2207w(y)) dy < \u03ba,\nBd\n\nand using the generalized Riemann\u2013Lebesgue Lemma, Corollary 2.5, we could infer the\nexistence of \u03bc \u2208 GYreg (A0 ) with hhfH , \u03bcii < \u03ba, a contradiction. Also, by the formula (2.1)\nfor the quasiconvex envelope in conjunction with the (classical) Jensen inequality,\nQg\u03b5 (A0 ) \u2265 QfH (A0 ) + \u03b5|A0 | > \u2212\u221e.\nSince it is not identically \u2212\u221e, the function Qg\u03b5 is quasiconvex, this is proved for example in\nthe appendix of [10]. Next, from Qg\u01eb \u2264 g\u01eb we infer the upper bound Qg\u01eb (A) \u2264 (M + 1)(1 +\n|A|). Because Qg\u01eb is separately convex and finite by the above reasoning, Lemma 2.5 in [13]\nimplies that also |Qg\u01eb (A)| \u2264 M\u0303 (1 + |A|) for some M\u0303 > 0 that depends on the dimensions\nm, d, and the growth bound M + 1.\nUsing g\u03b5 \u2265 Qg\u03b5 , g\u03b5\u221e \u2265 (Qg\u03b5 )# , and employing the assumption (3.1) we get\nZ\nd\u03bb\u03c3\n(y) dy \u2265 Qg\u03b5 (A0 )\u03c9d .\n(3.2)\ng\u03b5 , \u03c3 \u2265\nQg\u03b5 , \u03c3y + (Qg\u03b5 )# , \u03c3y\u221e\nd\ndL\nd\nB\n\n\f10\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\n1,\u221e\nThe formula (2.1) for the quasiconvex envelope yields a sequence (wj ) \u2282 WA\n(Bd ; Rm )\n0x\nwith\nZ\ng\u03b5 (\u2207wj (y)) dy \u2192 Qg\u03b5 (A0 )\u03c9d .\nBd\n\nMoreover, by quasiconvexity of QfH and possibly discarding leading elements of the sequence\n(wj ),\nZ\nZ\nQg\u03b5 (A0 ) + 1 \u2265 \u2212 g\u03b5 (\u2207wj (y)) dy \u2265 \u2212 QfH (\u2207wj (y)) + \u03b5|\u2207wj (y)| dy\nBd\n\nBd\n\n\u03b5\n\u2207wj\n\u2265 QfH (A0 ) +\n\u03c9d\n\nL1 (Bd ;Rm\u00d7d )\n\n.\n\nHence, by the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Friedrichs inequality the sequence (wj ) is uniformly bounded in\nY\n\nW1,1 (Bd ; Rm ) and we may assume that \u2207wj \u2192 \u03bc \u2208 GY(Bd ; Rm\u00d7d ). Now apply the averaging principle, Proposition 2.4 to replace \u03bc by its averaged version \u03bc\u0304 \u2208 GYreg (A0 ). From\nthe properties of \u03bc\u0304 and the definition of (wj ) we get\nZ\ng\u03b5 , \u03bc\u0304 = g\u03b5 , \u03bc = lim\ng\u03b5 (\u2207wj (y)) dy = Qg\u03b5 (A0 )\u03c9d .\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nBd\n\nCombining with (3.2), we arrive at\nfH , \u03c3\n\n1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3\n\u2265 Qg\u03b5 (A0 )\u03c9d \u2212 \u03b5 1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3\n= g\u03b5 , \u03bc\u0304 \u2212 \u03b5 1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3\n\u2265 fH , \u03bc\u0304 \u2212 \u03b5 1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3\n\u2265 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b5 1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3 ,\n= g\u03b5 , \u03c3 \u2212 \u03b5\n\nwhere the last estimate follows from \u03bc\u0304 \u2208 GYreg (A0 ) \u2282 H. Now let \u03b5 \u2193 0 to conclude\nfH , \u03c3 \u2265 \u03ba, whence \u03c3 \u2208 H.\n\u0003\n4. Local characterization II: Singular points\nNow let x0 \u2208 \u03a9 be a singular point of the Young measure \u03bd \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) for which we\nwant to show that it is indeed a gradient Young measure, and set\nA0 := id, \u03bdx\u221e0 .\nWe need to distinguish two cases: depending on whether A0 = a \u2297 \u03be for a \u2208 Rm \\ {0} and\n\u03be \u2208 Sd (i.e. rank A0 = 1), or A0 = 0, we need to work in a slightly different setup. From\nAlberti's Rank-One Theorem [1] we will infer that these two cases are the only ones we need\nto consider. In the first case every singular tangent Young measure \u03c3 has a concentration\nmeasure \u03bb\u03c3 that is one-directional in direction \u03be (also called \u03be-directional in the following), meaning that for any v \u22a5 \u03be it holds that \u03bb\u03c3 ( q + v) = \u03bb\u03c3 . In the second case, \u03bb\u03c3 is\narbitrary, but since the underlying deformation has zero boundary values, this case presents\nno added difficulty.\n4.1. The case A0 = a \u2297 \u03be. Assume that A0 = a \u2297 \u03be for a \u2208 Rm \\ {0} and \u03be \u2208 Sd . In all of\nthe following, Q\u03be denotes the (rotated) cube with |Q\u03be | = 1 and with one face orthogonal to\n\u03be \u2208 Sd\u22121 . Define the space\n\b\nEsing (\u03be) := f \u2208 Esing (Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ) : f (y, q) = f (y * \u03be, q) .\nHere and in the following, f (y, q) = f (y * \u03be, q) means that f only depends on y * \u03be. Notice\nthat f \u2208 Esing (\u03be) entails that f (y, q) is positively 1-homogeneous for all y \u2208 Q\u03be , see (2.5).\n\n\fYOUNG MEASURE CHARACTERIZATION IN BV\n\n11\n\nWe also set (cf. (2.6))\nYsing (a \u2297 \u03be) :=\n\n\b\n\n\u221e\n\u03c3 \u2208 Ysing (Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ) : [\u03c3] = (a \u2297 \u03be) \u03bb\u03c3 , \u03c3y\u221e = \u03c3y*\u03be\nand\n\n\u03bb\u03c3 is \u03be-directional ,\n\nGYsing (a \u2297 \u03be) := Ysing (a \u2297 \u03be) \u2229 GYsing (Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ),\n\b\n[G]Y0sing (a \u2297 \u03be) := \u03c3 \u2208 [G]Ysing (a \u2297 \u03be) : \u03bb\u03c3 (\u2202Q\u03be ) = 0 .\n\nm\nNotice that for all \u03c3 \u2208 GY sing\n0 (a \u2297 \u03be) any underlying deformation u \u2208 BV(Q\u03be ; R ), i.e. with\n[\u03c3] = Du, is of the form u(y) = u0 +a\u03c8(y *\u03be) for some u0 \u2208 Rm and \u03c8 \u2208 BV(0, 1). For weak*\nconvergence in [G]Y0sing (a \u2297 \u03be) we only require convergence for positively 1-homogeneous\nfunctions f = f \u221e . We also observe that\n\n(a \u2297 \u03be) \u03bb\u03c3 = [\u03c3] = id, \u03c3y\u221e \u03bb\u03c3 (y),\nwhereby hid, \u03c3y\u221e i = a \u2297 \u03be is independent of y (\u03bb\u03c3 -a.e.).\nThen, via the usual duality pairing hh q, qii, the space Ysing (a \u2297 \u03be) is considered a part\nof the dual space to Esing (\u03be). Again, the space of test functions Esing (\u03be) is separating for\nYsing (a \u2297 \u03be), that is, if for \u03c31 , \u03c32 \u2208 Ysing (a \u2297 \u03be) it holds that hhf, \u03c31 ii = hhf, \u03c32 ii for all\nf \u2208 Esing (\u03be), then \u03c31 = \u03c32 . This can be checked by considering elements in Esing (\u03be) of the\nform f (x, A) := \u03c6(x)h(A) with \u03c6 \u2208 C(Q\u03be ) satisfying \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(x * \u03be), and h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d )\npositively 1-homogeneous (use the \u03be-directionality of y 7\u2192 \u03c3y\u221e and \u03bb\u03c3 ).\nLemma 4.1. Considered as subsets of the dual space Esing (\u03be)\u2217 , the set GYsing (a \u2297 \u03be) is\nweakly*-closed and the set GYsing\n0 (a \u2297 \u03be) is convex.\nProof. Weak* closedness of GY sing (a \u2297 \u03be): Let \u03c3 be in the weak* closure of GYsing (a \u2297 \u03be).\nTake a countable set {fk } = {\u03c6k \u2297 hk } \u2282 Esing (\u03be) that determines singular Young measures;\nthis can be constructed by a procedure analogous to the one in Lemma 2.2. Then, for each\nj \u2208 N there exists \u03c3j \u2208 GY sing (a \u2297 \u03be) such that\nfk , \u03c3j\n\n\u2212 fk , \u03c3\n\n\u2264\n\n1\nj\n\n1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3j \u2212 1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3\n\nand\n\n\u2264\n\n1\nj\n\n\u2217\nwhenever k \u2264 j, whereby \u03c3j \u21c1 \u03c3 in GY sing (a \u2297 \u03be). Moreover, since 1 \u2297 | q| \u2208 Esing (\u03be),\na subsequence converges weakly* to a limit in Y(Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ), which must be \u03c3 because\n\u2217\nEsing (\u03be) \u2282 E(Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ). Thus, also \u03c3j \u21c1 \u03c3 in Y(Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ). Clearly, \u03c3y = \u03b40 for Ld almost every y \u2208 Q\u03be . Since the Young measure convergence implies the convergence of\n\u2217\nthe barycenters (as measures) and \u03bb\u03c3j \u21c1 \u03bb\u03c3 (test with h(A) := |A|), we immediately get\n[\u03c3] = (a \u2297 \u03be)\u03bb\u03c3 as well.\nFor all \u03c6 \u2297 h \u2208 E(Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ) with supp \u03c6 \u2282\u2282 Q\u03be and all sufficiently small \u03b7 \u22a5 \u03be, we have\nby the translation-invariance of y 7\u2192 (\u03c3j )\u221e\ny and \u03bb\u03c3j with respect to directions orthogonal to\n\u03be,\nZ\nZ\nd\u03bb\u03c3j (y)\n\u03c6(y + \u03b7) h, \u03c3y\u221e d\u03bb\u03c3 (y) = lim\n\u03c6(y + \u03b7) h, (\u03c3j )\u221e\ny\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nQ\u03be\n\n= lim\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nQ\u03be\n\nQ\u03be\n\nZ\n\nQ\u03be\n\nd\u03bb\u03c3j (y)\n\u03c6(y) h, (\u03c3j )\u221e\ny\n\n\u03c6(y) h, \u03c3y\u221e d\u03bb\u03c3 (y).\n\nHence, varying \u03c6 and h, we may conclude that also y 7\u2192 \u03c3y\u221e and \u03bb\u03c3 are \u03be-directional.\nIt remains to show that \u03c3 can be generated by a sequence of gradients. Since all the \u03c3j\nlie in GY sing (a \u2297 \u03be), we know that for each j \u2208 N there exists uj \u2208 W1,1 (Q\u03be ; Rm ) with\nZ\n1\nfk (x, \u2207uj (x)) dx \u2212 fk , \u03c3j \u2264\nj\nQ\n\n\f12\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\nand\nk\u2207uj kL1 (Q\u03be ;Rm\u00d7d ) \u2212\n\n1 \u2297 | q|, \u03c3j\n\n\u2264\n\n1\n,\nj\n\nagain for all k \u2264 j. Thus, the gradients (\u2207uj ) are uniformly bounded in L1 (Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d )\nand we may add a constant to every uj and employ Poincar\u00e9's inequality to make the\nsequence (uj ) uniformly bounded in W1,1 (Q\u03be ; Rm ). Therefore, there exists a subsequence\nY\n\n(not relabeled) with \u2207uj \u2192 \u03bc \u2208 GY(Q\u03be ; Rm\u00d7d ). The construction entails hhfk , \u03bcii =\nhhfk , \u03c3ii for all k \u2208 N, hence \u03bc = \u03c3.\nsing\nConvexity of GYsing\n0 (a \u2297 \u03be): Let \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 GY 0 (a \u2297 \u03be) and \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1). We need to show\nsing\nthat \u03b8\u03bc + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03bd \u2208 GY 0 (a \u2297 \u03be), the convex combination here being understood in the\nsense of functionals on Esing (\u03be). Without loss of generality we may assume that \u03be = e1 ,\nthe first unit vector, and Q\u03be = Q(0, 1). First we show that it suffices to prove the assertion\nfor averaged measures, where by \"averaged\" we mean that they originate from the averaging procedure of Proposition 2.4. Indeed, an adaptation of the approximation principle,\nProposition 2.6, entails that all Young measures \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 GYsing\n0 (a \u2297 \u03be) are weak* (sequential)\nlimits of sequences of piecewise homogeneous and averaged gradient Young measures, i.e.\n\u03bc = w*-limk\u2192\u221e \u03bck and \u03bd = w*-limk\u2192\u221e \u03bdk , where with the notation of Proposition 2.6,\nN (k)\n\nN (k)\n\nf, \u03bck\n\n=\n\nX\n\nand\n\nf, \u03bc Ckl\n\nf, \u03bdk\n\n=\n\nX\n\nf, \u03bd\n\nCkl .\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\nand (Ld + \u03bb\u03bc + \u03bb\u03bd )(\u2202Ckl ) = 0 for all l = 1, . . . , N (k) and k \u2208 N. From the proof of said\nproposition in Section 5.3 of [14] we know that for every fixed l \u2208 N the sets (Ckl )k are\ncuboids arranged in a lattice; in fact it is not difficult to see that we may choose the same\nopen cubes (Ckl ) for both \u03bc and \u03bd and such that \u03be = e1 is a face normal to all the Ckl 's.\nWe will show below that the set of homogeneous, averaged gradient Young measures is\nconvex. Assuming this for the moment, we get \u03b8\u03bc Ckl + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03bd Ckl \u2208 GY sing\n0 (a \u2297 \u03be) for\nall \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), where the operation of addition is to be understood in the sense of functionals\nin Esing (Q; Rm\u00d7d )\u2217 . Hence, the Young measure\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b8\u03bc + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03bd = w*-lim \u03b8\u03bck + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03bdk\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n= w*-lim\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nN (k) h\n\nX\n\n\u03b8\u03bc Ckl + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03bd\n\nl=1\n\nCkl\n\ni\n\nGYsing\n0 (a\n\n\u2297 \u03be). For this note that we can glue together suitable\nlies in the weak*-closure of\ngenerating sequences of the Young measures \u03b8\u03bc Ckl +(1\u2212\u03b8)\u03bd Ckl via a standard staircase\nconstruction employing Lemma 2.3 and the one-directionality of the underlying deformations. By the weak* closedness assertion from the first part of the lemma, we may conclude\n\u03b8\u03bc + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03bd \u2208 GY sing\n0 (a \u2297 \u03be) (\u03bb\u03b8\u03bc+(1\u2212\u03b8)\u03bd (\u2202Q) = 0 follows since \u03bb\u03bc (\u2202Q) = \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202Q) = 0),\nproving the second assertion of the present lemma.\nTo show convexity for the set of homogenous, averaged Young measures used above, let\nC \u2282 Q be an open cube with (Ld + \u03bb\u03bc + \u03bb\u03bd )(\u2202C) = 0. Without loss of generality we further\nassume C to be the unit cube Q(0, 1) = (\u22121/2, 1/2)d. Denote by \u03bc\u0304, \u03bd\u0304 \u2208 GY(C; Rm\u00d7d ) the\ncorresponding averagings of \u03bc C and \u03bd C, respectively. In particular (see (2.4)),\nZ\n\u03c6 \u2297 h, \u03bc\u0304 = 1 \u2297 h, \u03bc C \u2212 \u03c6(x) dx,\nZC\n\u03c6 \u2297 h, \u03bd\u0304 = 1 \u2297 h, \u03bd C \u2212 \u03c6(x) dx\nC\n\nm\u00d7d\n\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 C(C), h \u2208 C(R\n) with \u03c6 \u2297 h \u2208 E(C; Rm\u00d7d ). The underlying deformations\nof \u03bc\u0304, \u03bd\u0304 are affine functions and they only depend on the direction \u03be = e1 , so say [\u03bc\u0304] = Du,\n[\u03bd\u0304] = Dv with u(x) = q1 ax1 and v(x) = q2 ax1 for some constants q1 , q2 \u2208 R.\n\n\fYOUNG MEASURE CHARACTERIZATION IN BV\nY\n\n13\n\nY\n\nLet \u2207uj \u2192 \u03bc\u0304 and \u2207vj \u2192 \u03bd\u0304, where (uj ), (vj ) \u2282 W1,1 (C; Rm ) are both uniformly W1,1 \u2217\n\u2217\nbounded sequences with uj \u21c1 u, vj \u21c1 v.

The case A0 = 0. In this case, we cannot infer anything about the concentration measure (like one-directionality). But since the underlying deformation is zero, the procedures\nof Section 4.1 still work with slight modifications. Therefore, we can proceed via the same\nstrategy, but working in the following spaces:\nEsing (Sd\u22121 ) := Esing (Q(0, 1); Rm\u00d7d),\n\b\nYsing (0) := \u03c3 \u2208 Ysing (Q(0, 1); Rm\u00d7d) : [\u03c3] = 0 ,\n\nGYsing (0) := Ysing (0) \u2229 GYsing (Q(0, 1); Rm\u00d7d ),\n\b\n[G]Y0sing (0) := \u03c3 \u2208 [G]Ysing (0) : \u03bb\u03c3 (\u2202Q(0, 1)) = 0 .\n\nThe result, for which we omit the proof, is the following:\nProposition 4.3.

Proof of the BV characterization theorem\nWe are now in a position to prove Proposition 1.2 and thus Theorem 1.1. So let \u03bd be a\nYoung measure as in the statement of this proposition.\nStep 1. We first look at regular points. By Proposition 2.7, at Ld -almost every point\nx0 \u2208 \u03a9, there exists a regular tangent Young measure \u03c3 \u2208 Yreg (A0 ) to \u03bd at x0 , where\nd\u03bb\u03bd\n(x0 ).\ndLd\n\nA0 := id, \u03bdx0 + id, \u03bdx\u221e0\n\nLet h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ) be quasiconvex with linear growth at infinity. By the properties of \u03c3 (notice\nd\u03bb\u03bd\nd\u03bb\u03c3\nin particular that dL\nd (y) = const = dLd (x0 ) a.e.), and assumption (i) in the statement of\nTheorem 1.1, we get\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd\n\u221e d\u03bb\u03c3\n(y) = h id, \u03bdx0 + id, \u03bdx0\n(x0 )\nh id, \u03c3y + id, \u03c3y\ndLd\ndLd\nd\u03bb\u03bd\n(x0 )\n\u2264 h, \u03bdx0 + h# , \u03bdx\u221e0\ndLd\nd\u03bb\u03c3\n= h, \u03c3y + h# , \u03c3y\u221e\n(y)\ndLd\nfor Ld -almost every y \u2208 Bd . Hence, (3.1) is satisfied, and we may apply Proposition 3.2 to\ninfer that \u03c3 is a regular gradient Young measure, \u03c3 \u2208 GY reg (A0 ).\nFrom a close inspection of the construction of \u03c3 in the localization principle at regular\npoints, Proposition 2.7 (cf. [21,22]), we infer that \u03c3 = w*-limn\u2192\u221e \u03c3 (rn ) for a sequence rn \u2193 0,\nwhere \u03c3 (rn ) is given by\nEE\n1 DD \u0010 q \u2212 x0 \u0011\n\u03c6 \u2297 h, \u03c3 (rn ) = d \u03c6\n\u2297 h, \u03bd ,\n\u03c6 \u2297 h \u2208 E(Bd ; Rm\u00d7d ).\nrn\nrn\nIn particular, since \u03bd has underlying deformation u \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ), the Young measure \u03c3 (rn )\ncan be assumed to have the underlying deformation\nu(n) (y) =\n\nu(x0 + rn y) \u2212 \u0169(x0 )\n,\nrn\n(x0 ,rn )\n\nDu(n) = rn\u2212d T\u2217\n\ny \u2208 Bd ,\n\nso\n\nDu,\n(x ,r )\n\nwhere \u0169(x0 ) is the value of the precise representative of u at x0 and T\u2217 0 n Du := Du(x0 +\nrn q) is the pushforward of Du under the affine transformation T (x0 ,rn ) (x) := (x \u2212 x0 )/rn .\n\u2217\nWe infer Du(n) \u21c1 [\u03c3] = Dv for v(y) := \u2207u(x0 )y. Additionally, we even have u(n) \u2192 v\nwith respect to the so-called strict convergence, meaning that u(n) \u2192 v in L1 (Bd ) and\n|Du(n) |(Bd ) \u2192 |Dv|(Bd ). This can be seen once again from the proof of the regular localization principle. More precisely, by the assumptions in the proof of said result,\nlim |Du(n) |(Bd ) = lim\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n|Du|(B(x0 , rn ))\n|Du|(B(x0 , rn ))\n= \u03c9d lim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\nrnd\n|B(x0 , rn )|\n\n= \u03c9d |\u2207u(x0 )| = |Dv|(Bd ).\nThus, the strict continuity of the trace operator, see Section 3.8 in [3], implies\nZ\n|v \u2212 u(n) | dHd\u22121 \u2192 0.\n\u2202Bd\n\nLet (vj ) \u2282 W1,1 (Bd ; Rm ) be a norm-bounded generating sequence of \u03c3 that additionally\nsatisfies vj |\u2202Bd = v|\u2202Bd (this can always be achieved by Lemma 2.3). Set\n\u0010x \u2212 x \u0011\n0\n(n)\nvj (x) := rn vj\n+ \u0169(x0 ),\nx \u2208 B(x0 , rn ).\n(5.1)\nrn\n\n\f20\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\nThe above considerations yield by a change of variables,\nZ\nZ\n(n)\n|rn v(y) \u2212 u(x0 + rn y) + \u0169(x0 )| dHd\u22121 (y)\n|vj \u2212 u| dHd\u22121 = rnd\u22121\n\u2202Bd\n\n\u2202B(x0 ,rn )\n\n= rnd\n\nZ\n\n\u2202Bd\n\n|v \u2212 u(n) | dHd\u22121 = rnd o(1).\n\n(5.2)\n\nHere, o(1) stands for a quantity that vanishes as n \u2192 \u221e (or, equivalently, rn \u2193 0).\nStep 2. Turning our attention to singular points, we get from Proposition 2.8 that at\nsing\n\u03bbs\u03bd -almost every x0 \u2208 \u03a9 we can find a singular tangent Young measure \u03c3 \u2208 Yloc\n(Rd ; Rm\u00d7d )\nto \u03bd at x0 . Since [\u03bd] = Du, we have\nDs u = [\u03bd]s = hid, \u03bdx\u221e i \u03bbs\u03bd (dx)\nand by Alberti's Rank-One Theorem [1], see for example Theorem 3.94 in [3], we get that\nfor \u03bbs\u03bd -almost every x0 ,\nrank id, \u03bdx\u221e0 \u2264 1.\nMoreover, if rank id, \u03bdx\u221e0 = 1, that is,\nA0 := id, \u03bdx\u221e0 = a \u2297 \u03be,\n\nfor some a \u2208 Rm \\ {0}, \u03be \u2208 Sd\u22121 ,\n\nthen a \"rigidity\" corollary to Alberti's Theorem (Theorem 3.95 in [3] or, alternatively,\nLemma 3.2 in [23]) implies that \u03bbs\u03c3 is one-directional in the sense that \u03bbs\u03c3 (A + h) = \u03bbs\u03c3 (A)\nfor any Borel set A \u2282 Rd and h \u22a5 \u03be. In fact, any underlying deformation v \u2208 BVloc (Rd ; Rm )\nof \u03c3 satisfies Dv = A0 |Dv|, this is a generic property of blow-ups, cf. Proposition 3.2 in [21].\nHence, we have that \u03c3 \u2208 Ysing (A0 ) for one of the spaces Ysing (. . .) from either Section 4.1\nor 4.2. Of course, \u03c3 \u2208 Ysing (A0 ) really means that the restriction of \u03c3 to the appropriate\ncube Q\u03be (0, 1) or Q(0, 1) lies in Ysing (A0 ), where Q\u03be (0, 1) is the unit cube with one face\northogonal to \u03be \u2208 Sd\u22121 . Moreover, since we started from a tangent Young measure on all of\nRd , we may even assume \u03c3 \u2208 Y0sing (A0 ), i.e. \u03bb\u03c3 (\u2202Q) = 0, by a simple rescaling argument.\nLet g \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ) be quasiconvex and positively 1-homogeneous. Then, from (2.7) and\nassumption (ii) in Theorem 1.1 we get\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng id, \u03c3y\u221e = g id, \u03bdx\u221e0 \u2264 g, \u03bdx\u221e0 = g, \u03c3y\u221e\nfor \u03bb\u03c3 -almost every y \u2208 Q. Therefore, one of the two Propositions 4.2, 4.3 (which particular one is applicable depends on A0 ) implies that \u03c3 is a gradient Young measure,\n\u03c3 \u2208 GY sing\n0 (A0 ). Notice that here the representation of limits through the Young measure holds only for positively 1-homogeneous f = f \u221e \u2208 Esing (Q; Rm\u00d7d ), but this will suffice\nlater on.\nAgain, \u03c3 is the weak* limit of Young measures \u03c3 (rn ) for a sequence rn \u2193 0, where this\ntime the \u03c3 (rn ) are given by\nEE\nDD \u0010 q \u2212 x \u0011\n1\n0\n\u2297 h, \u03bd ,\ncn =\n,\n(5.3)\n\u03c6 \u2297 h, \u03c3 (rn ) = cn \u03c6\nrn\nhh1Q(x0 ,rn ) \u2297 | q|, \u03bdii\nfor all \u03c6 \u2297 h \u2208 E(Q; Rm\u00d7d ). In particular, for the underlying deformation un \u2208 BV(Q; Rm )\nof \u03c3 (rn ) we may choose\n\u0001\nu(n) (y) = rnd\u22121 cn u(x0 + rn y) \u2212 \u016b(n) ,\ny \u2208 Q,\nso\n(x ,r )\n\nDu(n) = cn T\u2217 0 n Du,\nR\nwhere \u016b(n) := \u2212Q(x0 ,rn ) u dx. Moreover, we can assume that u(n) \u2192 v strictly with [\u03c3] = Dv\n\u2217\n\nfor v \u2208 BV(Q; Rm ). This follows since |Du(n) | \u21c1 |Dv| by properties of blow-ups (see\nProposition 3.2 in [21]) and also |Dv|(\u2202Q) \u2264 \u03bb\u03c3 (\u2202Q) = 0, hence |Du(n) |(Q) \u2192 |Dv|(Q) by\nstandard results in measure theory. A detailed proof can be found in Lemma 3.1 of [23].\n\n\fYOUNG MEASURE CHARACTERIZATION IN BV\n\n21\n\nFor a generating sequence (vj ) \u2282 W1,1 (Q; Rm ) of \u03c3 with the additional property vj |\u2202Q =\nv|\u2202Q , we define\n\u0010x \u2212 x \u0011\n1\n0\n(n)\n+ \u016b(n) ,\nx \u2208 Q(x0 , rn ).\n(5.4)\nvj (x) := d\u22121 vj\nrn\nrn cn\n\nBy the strict continuity of the trace operator, we may therefore derive\nZ\nZ\n(n)\n(n)\n|rn1\u2212d c\u22121\n| dHd\u22121 (y)\n|vj \u2212 u| dHd\u22121 = rnd\u22121\nn v(y) \u2212 u(x0 + rn y) + \u016b\n\u2202Q\n\n\u2202Q(x0 ,rn )\n\n=\n\n1\ncn\n\nZ\n\n\u2202Q\n\n|v \u2212 u(n) | dHd\u22121 = c\u22121\nn o(1).\n\nStep 3. We collect all regular points from Step 1 in the set R \u2282 \u03a9 and all singular\npoints from Step 2 in the set S \u2282 \u03a9; note that we can assume that both R and S are\nBorel sets. Then, (Ld + \u03bb\u03bd )(\u03a9 \\ (R \u222a S)) = 0 and R, S are disjoint. Further, take a Young\nmeasure-determining set of integrands {\u03c6l \u2297 hl }l \u2282 E(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d ) as in Lemma 2.2.\nLet k \u2208 N.

The main result of [12] entails that every quasiconvex (hence rank-one convex) and positively 1-homogeneous g : Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R is in fact convex at the rank-one matrix hid, \u03bdx\u221e i, whereby the second condition in Theorem 1.1 reduces to\nthe classical Jensen inequality and so is always satisfied. More precisely, the result from [12]\nsays that there exists a linear function l : Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R such that g(hid, \u03bdx\u221e i) = l(hid, \u03bdx\u221e i)\nand l \u2264 g.

Splitting of generating sequences\nIn this final section we briefly discuss an interesting application of the BV-characterization\ntheorem to the splitting of generating sequences for Young measures with an \"atomic\" part.\nConsider a gradient Young measure \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm ) with the property that for a given\nfunction v \u2208 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) the concentration part of \u03bd can be split into two mutually singular\nparts as\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndDs v\n\u03bdx\u221e \u03bb\u03bd (dx) = \u03bdx\u221e \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 |Ds v| (dx) + \u03b4p(x) |Ds v|(dx),\nwhere p(x) =\n(x).\nd|Ds v|\nMore precisely, we assume:\n\n(i) The measures \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 |Ds v| and |Ds v| are mutually singular (hence both positive),\n(ii) \u03bdx\u221e = \u03b4p(x) for |Ds v|-almost every x \u2208 \u03a9.\nIntuitively, (i) and (ii) mean that Dv is an \"atomic\" part of \u03bd (the absolutely continuous\npart is actually uncritical, the issue is the concentration part). For reasons of simplicity let\nus also assume that\n(iii) \u03bb\u03bd (\u2202\u03a9) = 0,\notherwise one has to embed the functions and Young measures into a larger domain and\ntake into account boundary terms.\nThe natural conjecture now is that under the assumptions (i)\u2013(iii) one can find a generating sequence (uj ) \u2282 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) for \u03bd of the form uj = wj + v with (wj ) \u2282 BV(\u03a9; Rm )\n\u2217\nand Dwj \u21c1 [\u03bd] \u2212 Dv, that is, we can cleave the atomic part from the generating sequence.\nHowever, when trying to prove this result, one faces the difficulty that it is easy to add\nconcentrations, but very difficult in general to remove them (cf. Proposition 6 in [14] on\nshifting of Young measures). Indeed, naively setting wj := uj \u2212 v, where Duj is a generating sequence for \u03bd will not have the desired effect if (uj ) \u2282 C\u221e (\u03a9; Rm ). In fact, this\nprocedure corresponds to shifting \u03bd by \u2212Dv via Proposition 6 in [14] and only results in a\n(gradient) Young measure with the concentration part\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bdx\u221e \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 |Ds v| (dx) + \u03b4p(x) |Ds v|(dx) + \u03b4\u2212p(x) |Ds v|(dx),\n\nbut the last two parts do not cancel. So, using direct manipulations only, it seems rather hard\nto cut off the atomic part from a generating sequences, while at the same time preserving\nthe curl-freeness.\nWe will now use the characterization theorem in BV to prove the conjecture. Define the\nYoung measure \u03bc \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm ) as follows:\nh, \u03bcx := h( q \u2212 \u2207v(x), \u03bdx\n\u03bb\u03bc := \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 |Ds v|\n\u221e\n\u03bc\u221e\nx := \u03bdx\n\nfor Ld -a.e. x \u2208 \u03a9 and all h \u2208 Cc (Rm\u00d7d ),\n\n\u2208 M+ (\u03a9),\n\nfor \u03bb\u03bc -a.e. x \u2208 \u03a9.\n\n\f26\n\nFILIP RINDLER\n\nBy our assumptions (i)\u2013(iii) this definition always yields a Young measure \u03bc \u2208 Y(\u03a9; Rm\u00d7d )\nwith [\u03bc] = [\u03bd] \u2212 Dv. In particular, (i) entails that \u03bb\u03bc is a positive measure.\nNow, if h \u2208 C(Rm\u00d7d ) is a quasiconvex function with linear growth at infinity, then also\nh\u0303 : Rm\u00d7d \u2192 R given by h\u0303(A) := h(A \u2212 \u2207v(x)) for a.e. x \u2208 \u03a9 has these properties, and from\nthe necessity part of the characterization theorem applied to the gradient Young measure \u03bd\nit follows for Ld -almost every x \u2208 \u03a9 that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e d\u03bb\u03bd\n\u221e d\u03bb\u03bc\n(x) = h\u0303 id, \u03bdx + id, \u03bdx\n(x)\nh id, \u03bcx + id, \u03bcx\ndLd\ndLd\nd\u03bb\u03bd\n\u2264 h\u0303, \u03bdx + h\u0303# , \u03bdx\u221e\n(x)\ndLd\nd\u03bb\u03bc\n(x)\n= h, \u03bcx + h# , \u03bc\u221e\nx\ndLd\n\u221e\nd\nsince h\u0303# = h# and \u03bc\u221e\nx = \u03bdx L -almost everywhere. Moreover,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= h# id, \u03bdx\u221e \u2264 h# , \u03bdx\u221e = h# , \u03bc\u221e\nh# id, \u03bc\u221e\nx\nx\n\nfor \u03bbs\u03bc -almost every x \u2208 \u03a9.\nThe previous calculations show that \u03bc satisfies the assumptions of the sufficiency part\nof the characterization theorem, whereby \u03bc \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm ). Hence, there exists a sequence\nY\n(wj ) \u2282 (C\u221e \u2229 W1,1 )(\u03a9; Rm ) (also see Lemma 2.3) with Dwj \u2192 \u03bc. Then it is not difficult to\nsee that the sequence Dwj + Dv indeed generates the original Young measure \u03bd, for details\nsee Proposition 6 in [14]. Hence we have proved:\nTheorem 6.1. Let \u03bd \u2208 GY(\u03a9; Rm ) satisfy the conditions (i)\u2013(iii) above. Then, there\nexists a sequence (uj ) \u2282 BV(\u03a9; Rm ) for \u03bd that can be split as\nuj = wj + v\n\n\u2217\n\nwith (wj ) \u2282 (C\u221e \u2229 W1,1 )(\u03a9; Rm ) and Dwj \u21c1 [\u03bd] \u2212 Dv.\n\nY\n\nand such that Duj \u2192 \u03bd.\nWe conclude with remarks about the situation where \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 |Ds v| and |Ds v| are not mutually singular and the concentration effects may interfere (for example in the common\nsituation that v = u, where [\u03bd] = Du). In this case we need to additionally require that the\nconcentration part of \u03bd can be written in the form\ns\n\u03bdx\u221e \u03bb\u03bd (dx) = \u03bc\u221e\nx \u03bb\u03bc (dx) + \u03b4p(x) |D v|(dx),\n\np(x) =\n\ndDs v\n(x),\nd|Ds v|\n\n+\nm\u00d7d\nfor another family (\u03bc\u221e\n) of positive (sub-probability) measures and a\nx )x\u2208\u03a9 \u2282 M (\u2202B\n+\npositive measure \u03bb\u03bc \u2208 M (\u03a9) (notice that these positivity properties are not automatic\nanymore). Moreover, absorbing an appropriate factor into \u03bb\u03bc , it can always be assumed\nthat \u03bc\u221e\nx is a probability measure. The regular Jensen-type inequality is proved exactly as\nbefore and by the main result of [12], the singular Jensen-type inequality is always satisfied,\ncf. Remark 5.1, so we can again employ the characterization result to conclude.\n\nReferences\n[1] G. Alberti, Rank one property for derivatives of functions with bounded variation, Proc. Roy.
