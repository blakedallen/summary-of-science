A better understanding of these quantum string corrections\nwould not only elucidate various aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence between string theory\non AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and d = 4, N = 4 SU(Nc ) SYM theory, but would moreover provide valuable\ninsight into the structure of quantum strings on curved, flux-supported backgrounds, which so\nfar are not amenable to standard quantization techniques.\nA bold and possibly very powerful conjecture was put forward, packaging the complete\nquantum string spectrum on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 into a Bethe ansatz [1, 2, 3]. This proposal was partly\ninspired by the Bethe ansatz description of anomalous dimensions of gauge-invariant operators\nin SYM [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 8], and likewise the existence of a Bethe-ansatz-like structure for the\nclassical string on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Needless to say, testing this Bethe ansatz\nis of utmost importance.\nA particularly restrictive constraint that has to be met by the Bethe ansatz are the worldsheet corrections to the Frolov-Tseytlin solutions that can be computed semi-classically [15,\n16, 17, 18, 19]. The present status of these investigations is that the string Bethe ans\u00e4tze\ncapture these semi-classical results only partly [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The subject of this letter is\nto pinpoint the problem which is causing the disagreement.\nThe one-loop energy shift, i.e., the O(\u03b1\u2032 ) corrections to the string energy, has been discussed\nat leading order in the 't Hooft coupling \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb/J 2 in [20, 21]. In particular, the analysis of\n[20] showed, that these corrections could be computed from the Landau-Lifschitz model, which\narises from the S 3 sector of the sigma model. In [22] a thorough investigation of the comparison\nbetween Bethe ansatz and semi-classical strings was undertaken, concluding, that under the\nassumption that a certain zeta-function regularization is applicable, there is agreement at least\nup to order \u03bb\u2032 3 and furthermore the string energy has an analytic expansion in \u03bb\u2032 . However, the\nsemi-classical strings and Bethe ansatz expressions were also shown to disagree when expanded\nfor large winding numbers. This was the first indication that the Bethe ansatz may not entirely\nreproduce the semi-classical result.\nIn addition to the large winding number discrepancy, one can convince oneself of the limitations of zeta-function regularization, which can be pinned down already on the level of relatively\nsimple sums [24]. Applying an integral approximation to the one-loop energy shift in the su(2)\nsector, i.e., spinning strings on S 3 \u00d7 R, it was argued that the \u03bb\u2032 -expansion contains not only\nthe analytic terms that arise from zeta-function regularization, but also contains non-analytic\n\u2032\nterms of order \u03bb\u2032 (2n+1)/2 [23, 24, 25] and possibly exponential corrections of order e\u2212\u03bb [24].\nFurthermore, neither of these are captured by the string Bethe ansatz. In [23] a proposal was\nput forward, which corrects the Bethe ansatz in order to incorporate the non-analytic terms.\nThe purpose of this letter is to derive the exact expression for the coefficients in the \u03bb\u2032 expansion of the one-loop worldsheet correction in the su(2)-case as computed from a semiclassical analysis in [15, 18].\nBefore summarizing our findings, let us briefly recall the structure of the one-loop energy\nshift. Consider the classical spinning string solution to the supersymmetric sigma-model on\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , which is supported on S 3 \u00d7 R and carries S 3 angular momentum J. Classically, the\nsystem is fully described by the fields on S 3 \u00d7R, and the remaining directions in the sigma-model\n1\n\n\fdecouple. This is however no longer the case for the quantum corrections, which are a sum over\ncharacteristic frequencies with contributions from all fields within the supersymmetric AdS5 \u00d7\nS 5 sigma-model (in the present case there are two S 3 fluctuation modes, in addition to the\ntransverse six bosonic and eight fermionic fluctuations). In particular, the direct quantization\nof the classical reduced system need not lead to the correct quantum string spectrum, as was\ne.g. observed in [26]. Note that this is quite different to the dual gauge theory, where e.g., the\nsu(2) subsector remains closed to all loops, see also [27].\nExpanding the sum over frequencies at O(\u03b1\u2032) in a series in the effective 't Hooft coupling\n\u03bb\u2032 , we find the following:\n\u2022 Analytic terms \u03bb\u2032 n : S 3 modes\n\u2022 Non-analytic terms \u03bb\u2032 (2n+1)/2 : S 3 , transverse bosonic and fermionic modes\n\u2032\n\n\u2022 Exponential terms e\u2212\u03bb : S 3 , transverse bosonic and fermionic modes.\nThis in particular confirm the leading order in \u03bb\u2032 result of [20], where it was shown that the\nanalytic terms can be reproduced from the Landau-Lifschitz model, which only sees the S 3 part of the fluctuations. Furthermore this is in agreement with the analytic terms arising from\nzeta-function regularization in [22, 24]. The non-analytic terms confirm the ones in [23, 25],\nwhere they were constructed by means of an Euler-Maclaurin type integral approximation to\nthe sum over fluctuation frequencies. The procedure which we apply systematically incorporate\nall these results, and furthermore shows the existence of the exponentially suppressed terms.\nSome comments are in order: firstly, one should keep in mind, that in the su(2) sector,\nwhich we study here in detail, the solution is not stable for arbitrary choices of the parameter\nk. In particular, the fluctuation frequencies become complex for 2k > 1. One therefore has to\nanalytically continue the expression for the energy in k. This instability can also be seen from\nthe Bethe ansatz, as was discussed in [20]. Therefore, any discussion of the su(2) sector needs\nto be taken with a grain of salt.\nKeeping this in mind, one can nevertheless investigate the comparison to the Bethe ansatz.\nThe Bethe ansatz of [1] captures precisely the analytic terms, however misses out the nonanalytic and exponential corrections. Put differently, our findings suggest that the Bethe ansatz\nonly accounts for parts of the S 3 fluctuation modes, and in particular misses out the transverse\nbosonic and fermionic fluctuations. This may well be not surprising, as the quantum string\nBethe ansatz is structurally formulated in a similar way to the SYM Bethe ansatz, and has\nthe same number of degrees of freedom. The corrections proposed in [23] account for the nonanalytic terms (at half-filling), however, it remains unclear, how to systematically find these\ncorrection terms, and furthermore, how to incorporate the exponential terms.\nIdeally the present analysis would be done for the stable solution in the sl(2) sector, which\nwas explored and compared to the Bethe ansatz in [22], again making use of the infamous\nzeta-function regularization. The semi-classically computed one-loop energy shift in this sector\n[19] is structurally more complicated, however the method that we apply here can be expected\nto also compute the sl(2) case exactly. We shall briefly discuss this at the end of the letter.\nThe plan of this note is as follows. An outline of the general stratagem in section 2 is\nfollowed by the analysis for the su(2) sector energy shift in section 3, for which we derive the\ncomplete series in \u03bb\u2032 . We conclude with comments on the sl(2) sector.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Strategy\n\nP\n\u2032\nConsider the following often-posed problem: given a sum S(\u03bb\u2032 ) =\nn\u2208Z f (n, \u03bb ), find the\n\u2032\nexpansion in terms of the parameter \u03bb around zero. Unless the sum converges uniformly,\nswapping the sum and expansion is not legitimate, wherefore in such an instant one is welladvised to first evaluate the sum and then perform the expansion in \u03bb\u2032 . In order to do so, we\nshall make use of a nice trick, which relates the sum to a contour integral in the complex plane,\nand allows to evaluate it by means of complex analytic methods, namely\nI\nX\n\u2032\ndz cot(\u03c0z)f (z, \u03bb\u2032 ) ,\n(2.1)\nf (n, \u03bb ) = \u03c0\n2\u03c0i\nn\u2208Z\n\nCr\n\nwith the contour Cr encircling the real axis. In case f (z, \u03bb\u2032 ) has branch-cuts inside the integration contour, the contribution of the integrals around these needs to be subtracted on the LHS.\nSubsequently deforming the contour to infinity, one is left with the sum over residues or cut\nintegrals of possible poles and branch-cuts of f (z, \u03bb\u2032 ) in the complex plane. This method was\ne.g., applied in the context of light-cone plane-wave string field theory [28, 29] and a version of\nit is known and used in field-theory as the Sommerfeld-Watson transform. The advantage is,\nthat in this way one either obtains a closed expression for the sum, or the limit \u03bb\u2032 \u2192 0 can be\nperformed directly on the resulting cut-integrals.\nAs a sample application consider the simple case of the folded string [16], the one-loop\nenergy shift of which is\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 X \u0010\u221a 2\n\u03ba\u03b4Efold = \u2212( 2 \u2212 3)\u03ba +\nn + 4\u03ba2 + 2 n2 + 2\u03ba2 + 5 n2 \u2212 8 n2 + \u03ba2 .\n(2.2)\n2 n\u2208Z\nTo evaluate this in a\u221a\nseries expansion for \u03ba \u2192 \u221e, apply (2.1), then the integrand is made out\nof terms of the type z 2 + a2 \u03ba2 , with branch-cuts from \u00b1ia\u03ba to \u00b1i\u221e. Deform the contour to\nencircle the respective cuts. One can formally do this by introducing a cutoff \u039b for each cutintegral, which then drops out when summing over the contributions of all the different cuts.\nIf one is only interested in the non-exponential correction terms, the integral can be computed\nby changing to z = iw\u03ba and setting coth(\u03c0w\u03ba) to one. Performing the integrals yields for each\nvalue of a\n\u0001\n1\nIa =\n2\u039b2 + a2 \u03ba2 (1 + log(4)) \u2212 2a2 \u03ba2 (log(ia\u03ba) + log(1/\u039b)) .\n(2.3)\n4\nThere is a subtlety for the integral with a = 0, as the branch-cut in this case is not along the\nimaginary axis, but extends from \u2212\u221e to 0. The integral needs to be computed separately in\nthis case and yields (in accord with the analytic continuation of the zeta-function)\nI \u03030 = \u22121/12 + \u039b2 /2 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nAdding the terms present in \u03b4E together, the divergences and log-terms cancel and we arrive\nat\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1\u0010\n5\n\u221a\n \u0303\nI2 + 2I 2 + 5I0 \u2212 8I1 = \u22123 log 2 \u03ba + (3 \u2212 2) \u2212\n+ O(e\u2212\u03ba ) ,\n(2.5)\n\u03b4Efold =\n\u03ba\n12\u03ba\nwhich indeed agrees with the findings in [16, 24].\n3\n\n\f3\n\nThe circular string on S 3 \u00d7 R\n\nLet us now apply this method to the circular string in the su(2) \"subsector\" with two equal\nspins J1 = J2 = J/2.

Furthermore\n\u03bb\u2032 = 1/J 2 and we wish to expand this for large J .\nTo be precise, (3.2) is the result for even winding. For odd winding the fermions are halfinteger moded, the field being antiperiodic [15, 18]. In this case the fermionic fluctuations are\nto be replaced as follows\nr\nr\nr\nn2 \u2212 k 2\n(n + 1/2)2 \u2212 k 2\n(n \u2212 1/2)2 \u2212 k 2\nfermi\n\u03b4E\n= \u22128 1 + 2\n\u2192\n\u22124\n\u2212\n4\n. (3.3)\n1\n+\n1\n+\nJ + k2\nJ 2 + k2\nJ 2 + k2\n(0)\n\nWe shall focus in the main part of the paper on the former and discuss the odd winding\nin appendix A. The frequencies appearing in \u03b4E are real for 2k < 1. We shall assume this\nthroughout the computation. The result can then be analytically continued to other values of\nk at the end.\nIn order to make use of (2.1), let us first rewrite the 1-loop energy shift as a sum over all\nintegers: the summands are all dependent only on n2 so that\n\u03b4E\n\nsu(2)\n\np\n\nJ2\n\n+\n\nk2\n\n\u221e\n1 X\n(\u03c9n + \u03a9n ) .\n=\n2 n=\u2212\u221e\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere \u03c9n and \u03a9n denotes the S 3 fluctuations and transverse/fermionic\nfluctuations, respectively.\n\u221a\nNote that the subtraction term from n = 0 is precisely \u03b4E (0) J 2 + k 2 . Applying (2.1) yields\nthe contour integral representation\n\u0012I\nI \u0013\nX\n1\n(\u03c9n + \u03a9n ) =\ndz cot(\u03c0z) (\u03c9z + \u03a9z ) .\n(3.5)\n\u2212\n2i\nC\nC\nr\n2\nn\u2208Z\nThe first term is simply the integral around the real axis. In order to understand the second integral, one needs to analyse the cut-structure. Furthermore, the branch-cuts determine\n4\n\n\fC1\n\nCr\nC2\nC2\n\nC1\n\nFigure 1: Change of integration contours. The branch-cuts are depicted by the yellow zig-zag\nlines.\n\nto which contour integrals we can deform the integration along Cr . The branch-cuts of the\nfermionic and transverse bosonic modes are between\np\np\n[\u2212i\u221e, \u2212iJ ] \u222a [iJ , i\u221e] ,\n(3.6)\n[\u2212i\u221e, \u2212i J 2 \u00b1 k 2 ] \u222a [i J 2 \u00b1 k 2 , i\u221e] ,\n\nrespectively and thus extend all along the imaginary axis. The fluctuations along the S 3 are\nessentially quartic roots, and the corresponding two branch-cuts can be aligned in the following\nnon-intersecting fashion\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\nJ2\nJ2\n\u2212i\u221e, \u2212i \u221a 2\n\u222a i\u221a 2\n, i\u221e ,\n[\u22122k, 2k] .\n(3.7)\nJ + k2\nJ + k2\nThe former is of the same type as the imaginary cuts in (3.6). The latter is a real cut. Due to\nthis branch-cut the corresponding integral around the cut (denoted by C2 ) has to be subtracted\nin (3.5) \u2013 see the LHS of figure 1.\nThe first contour around the real axis in (3.5) can be deformed to encircle the remaining\nbranch-cuts that extend on the imaginary axis, i.e.\n\u0012I\nI \u0013\nX\n1\ndz cot(\u03c0z) (\u03c9z + \u03a9z ) ,\n(3.8)\n\u2212\n(\u03c9n + \u03a9n ) =\n2i\nC2\nC1\nn\u2208Z\n\nwhere the deformed contours are depicted in figure 1. Obviously the terms in \u03a9z do not\ncontribute to the integral C2 . In order to evaluate these integrals for large J we analyse the\ntwo contributions separately. In summary we will find the following contributions:\nConsider first the integral along C1 . As the integration is along the imaginary axis, the\ncotangent becomes a hyperbolic cotangent. Changing variables to w = z/J , and expanding\nfor large J we can set the cotangent to one and evaluate the resulting line integrals. This\n5\n\n\fapproximation neglects exponentially small contributions in J (cf. similar discussion in the\npp-wave literature [30, 28, 29]). We shall see that the integrals along these cuts yield the\nnon-analytic terms, i.e., of order 1/J 2n+1 = \u03bb\u2032 n+1/2 .\nThe evaluation of the integral along C2 has to be performed without such an approximation\nas the cotangent clearly cannot be set to one. We evaluate these by expanding the integrand\nin 1/J and then integrating up each term with cot(\u03c0z) expanded as\n\u221e\nX\n1\n1\n.\ncot(x) = + 2x\n2\n2 m2\nx\nx\n\u2212\n\u03c0\nm=1\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis gives precisely the analytic terms as they were computed using zeta-function regularization.\nA remark in view of the analysis of Beisert and Tseytlin [23] is in order. The split between\nregular parts and singular parts of the integral approximation and the sum there, is precisely the\nsplit between the contours C1 and C2 . The above argument makes the there-observed agreement\nbetween regular and singular parts of the integral and sum, respectively, precise. Furthermore\nour analysis shows that there are exponentially small contributions to the sums, which can be\ncomputed as in [30, 28, 29].\n\n3.1\n\nNon-analytic terms\n\nThe integrals along C1 have contributions from all fluctuations, i.e., transverse, fermionic and\nS 3 -modes. Computing the line integrals for the transverse and fermionic modes, with an explicit\n(fixed) cut-off \u039b the integral is\nI\nItrans =\ndw \u03b4E trans (wJ )\nC1\u039b\n\n= \u2212 8 log(J )J 2 + 2\u039b2 + 2(J \u2212 k)(J + k) log(\u039b)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ (J 2 \u2212 k 2 ) log J 2 \u2212 k 2 + 2 J 2 + k 2 log J 2 + k 2 + (J 2 \u2212 k 2 )(1 + log(4)) .\n(3.10)\n3\nThe regulator dependence will drop out, once we add the contributions from the S modes.\nSimilarly the case of the frequencies coming from the S 3 can be discussed. Perform the\nchange of variables suggested by appendix C of [25]1 . The line integral with cut-off \u039b is\nstraight forwardly computed\nI\nIS 3 =\ndw \u03b4E trans (wJ )\nC1\u039b\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= \u2212 log(4)J 2 \u2212 J 2 \u2212 k 2 \u2212 2\u039b2 \u2212 2 J 2 \u2212 k 2 log(\u039b) + J 2 \u2212 k 2 log J 2 + k 2 + k 2 log(4) .\n(3.11)\nThus\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nItrans +IS 3 = \u22128 log(J )J 2 +3 log J 2 + k 2 J 2 \u22122k 2 + J 2 \u2212 k 2 log J 2 \u2212 k 2 +k 2 log J 2 + k 2 .\n(3.12)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\nNamely, y = n+ n2\u221a\u2212 4k 2 for n > 0 and\n\u221a y = n\u2212 n \u2212 4k for n < 0. Then the integral from n = \u2212\u039b * * * \u039b\n2\n2\n2\nextends from y = \u2212\u039b \u2212 \u039b \u2212 4k * * * \u039b + \u039b \u2212 4k .\n1\n\n6\n\n\fThe contribution of these terms to the energy are\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b4E na = \u221a 2\n8\nlog(J\n)J\n+\n2k\n+\nk\n\u2212\nJ\nlog\nJ\n\u2212\nk\n\u2212\n3J\n+\nk\nlog\nJ\n+\nk\n,\n2 J + k2\n(3.13)\nand have the large J expansion\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 8 1\n49 10 1\n1\n1 6 1\nna\nk\n+O\n.\n(3.14)\n\u03b4E = \u2212 k 5 + k 7 \u2212\n3 J\n3 J\n120 J 9\nJ 11\nThese are the non-analytic terms that were observed to be missed in the naive zeta-function\nregularization of the energy shift [23, 24, 25].\n\n3.2\n\nAnalytic terms\n\nFinally we are left with the cut-integral around C2 . As remarked earlier, the integral remains\nalong the real axis and thus the cotangent gives non-trivial contributions in the large J limit.\nExpanding the integrand \u03b4E (z) for large J yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2 1 \u221a 2\n1\n(z)\n2\n2\n\u03b4E = k \u2212 z + z z \u2212 4k\n2\n2\nJ2\n\u0012 4\n\u0013\n\u0001\u221a\n5k 4 1\nz\n1\n2\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212 z 2k + z\n+\nz 2 \u2212 4k 2\n8\n4\n8\nJ4\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u0001\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n1\n6\n2 4\n4 2\n6\n4\n4\n+\n14k + 17z k + 2z k \u2212 z + z 3k + z\n+O\n.\nz 2 \u2212 4k 2\n6\n16\n16\nJ\nJ8\n(3.15)\nIntegrating each order in J together with cot(\u03c0z) in the representation (3.9) yields precisely\nthe zeta-function regularized part, i.e., the analytic in \u03bb\u2032 terms.

This result simply provides a rigorous derivation of the energy shift\nwithout any unjustified assumptions.\n7\n\n\fFinally we need to address the zero mode terms. The contribution from \u03b4E (0) in (3.1) has\nalready been accounted for in (3.4). So the term that still needs to be accounted for is the 1/z\n\"zero-mode\" term in the expansion of the cotangent (3.9), which has a non-trivial residue at 0\nwith the contribution\nq\n\u221a\n\u03c0Resz=0 cot(\u03c0z) 4J 2 + 4k 2 + (z + z 2 \u2212 4k 2 )2 = 2J .\n(3.17)\nThis is again analytic in \u03bb\u2032 and the corresponding term has the expansion\n\u0012 \u0013\n3k 4 1\n5k 6 1\n1\nk2 1\nzero\n+\n\u2212\n+O\n.\n\u03b4E\n=1\u2212\n2\n4\n6\n2 J\n8 J\n16 J\nJ8\n\n(3.18)\n\nIn summary we obtain the rather concise expressions for the energy in an expansion in 1/J\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n1\n\u03b4E na = \u221a\n8 log(J )J 2 + 2k 2 + k 2 \u2212 J 2 log J 2 \u2212 k 2 \u2212 3J 2 + k 2 log J 2 + k 2\n2 J 2 + k2\n\u0015!\n\u221e\n\u221e \u0014I\nX\nX\n1\n2z\n1\n\u03b4E a =\ndz 2\n\u03b4E (z) J \u22122i\n\u03c0 i=1 J 2i n=1 C2\nz \u2212 n2\n\u03b4E zero = \u221a\n\nJ\n.\nJ 2 + k2\n\n(3.19)\nHere, \u03b4E J \u22122i denotes the coefficient of 1/J in the expansion of \u03b4E .

Here, we wish to determine an exact\nformula for them. The strategy is to differentiate \u03b4E (n) twice with respect to J . By this\nprocedure we can treat each frequency separately, as each separate sum converges, although\nwe loose information about the polynomial dependence on 1/J .

In particular the solutions in this sector\nare stable for all values of the winding numbers k and m (we refer the reader to [19, 22] for\nthe notation used). The AdS3 fluctuations are the obstruction to exactly evaluating the sum\nP\n(I)\n(I)\nin this case, and they are given by 4I=1 \u01ebn,I \u03c9n , where \u03c9n are roots of a quartic polynomial\nPn (\u03c9), and \u01ebn,I are signs. As a function of n these are complicated non-analytic functions, and\nunfortunately we have nothing much to say about these. However the structure of the transverse\nand fermionic fluctuations is similar to the ones in (3.2). In particular, these contribute only\nthrough branch-cuts of the type C1 and can be treated in an identical fashion to section 3.1.\nOne finds that these again contribute with odd powers of 1/J and exponential terms, which\nwhen compared to [22] are again yet to be included into the Bethe ansatz.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank S.
