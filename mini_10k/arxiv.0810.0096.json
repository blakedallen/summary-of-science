For this\nspace X, we enrich filtrated K-theory by another K-theory functor to a complete invariant up to KK(X)-equivalence that satisfies a Universal Coefficient\nTheorem.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. The UCT-problem. One of the main problems in the theory of C\u2217 -algebras\nis the computation of the equivariant KK-theory of C\u2217 -algebras endowed with some\nextra structure. Here we apply the general techniques developed in [6, 9] to the case\nof C\u2217 -algebras with a non-trivial ideal lattice. The appropriate version of KK-theory\nis Kirchberg's generalisation of Kasparov theory to C\u2217 -algebras over non-Hausdorff\ntopological spaces (see [5]). Our goal is to compute it in terms of more manageable\nK-theoretic information, generalising the usual Universal Coefficient Theorem that\ncomputes Kasparov's original theory for C\u2217 -algebras in the bootstrap class by an\nexact sequence\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(1.1)\nExt K\u2217+1 (A), K\u2217 (B) \u058c KK\u2217 (A, B) \u0589 Hom K\u2217 (A), K\u2217 (B) .\n\nThe generalisation of the bootstrap class to the case of C\u2217 -algebras with nontrivial ideal lattice was introduced and studied in [8]. Let us first recall some of\nthe notation from [8]. Let X be a (usually non-Hausdorff) topological space. A\nC\u2217 -algebra over X is a C\u2217 -algebra A endowed with a continuous map Prim(A) \u2192 X.\nLet C\u2217 alg(X) be the category of C\u2217 -algebras over X; the morphisms in C\u2217 alg(X) are\ngiven by X-equivariant (in obvious sense) \u2217 -homomorphisms. Taking Kirchberg's\nKK-groups as morphisms and the same objects, we get the category KK(X). It\nhas a structure of a triangulated category (see [8]). For finite X, the bootstrap\nclass B(X) is defined as the smallest subcategory of KK(X) that is closed under\nsuspension, isomorphism, exact triangles, and direct sums and contains all objects\nwith underlying C\u2217 -algebra C.\nGeneral methods from homological algebra suggest to study a homology theory H\u2217 for C\u2217 -algebras over X, taking values in some Abelian category C. Under\nsome mild assumptions, the machinery developed in [6, 9] yields an Adams type\nspectral sequence which abuts to KK(X; , ), with an E2 -term expressed in terms\nof H\u2217 .\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 19K35, 46L35, 46L80, 46M18, 46M20.\nThe second author was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) through the Institutional Strategy of the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nFor classification purposes, we need, instead of a spectral sequence, a short exact\nsequence of the type (1.1):\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(1.2)\nExtC H\u2217+1 (A), H\u2217 (B) \u058c KK\u2217 (X; A, B) \u0589 HomC H\u2217 (A), H\u2217 (B) ,\n\nand a precise description of the range of H\u2217 .\nIn this case, given two C\u2217 -algebras A and B over X that belong to the bootstrap\nclass, an isomorphism of H\u2217 (A) to H\u2217 (B) lifts to a KK(X)-equivalence between A\nand B. The results of Eberhard Kirchberg then allow to lift this KK(X)-equivalence\nto a \u2217 -isomorphism A \u223c\n= B, provided A and B are tight, purely infinite, stable,\nnuclear and separable; here tightness means that the maps Prim(A) \u2192 X and\nPrim(B) \u2192 X are homeomorphisms (see [5]). It is also shown in [8] that, in the\ncase when X is finite, any object of the bootstrap class is KK(X)-equivalent to a\ntight, purely infinite, stable, nuclear, separable C\u2217 -algebra over X.\nHence the existence of an exact sequence of the form (1.2) for all objects of the\nbootstrap class leads to a complete classification of the tight, purely infinite, stable,\nnuclear, separable C\u2217 -algebras over X in terms of their image under the functor H\u2217 .\n1.2. Main results. It is relatively easy to construct filtrations on KK which produce spectral sequences which converge to KK-groups on the bootstrap category\nand whose E2 -term involves only the K-theory of the quotients K\u2217 (A/J) for the\nideals J corresponding to minimal open subsets of X; an example is the filtration\nused in [8, Section 4.1]. However, this spectral sequence is not very useful for\npractical purposes, since it does not degenerate at the E2 -level. The second differential involves, in particular, the K-theory of various subquotients I/J for the\nideals I \u2282 J \u2282 A and the associated six-term exact sequences in K-theory\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n/ K0 J/I\n/ K0 J\nK0 I\nO\n(1.3)\n\u000f \u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK1 J/I o\nK1 J o\nK1 I .\n\nAlso higher differentials do not vanish.\nTo get a short exact sequence instead, we need to consider more sophisticated homology theories. The homology theory analysed here is \"filtrated K-theory,\" which\nis in some sense the second approximation to this spectral sequence. Roughly speaking, filtrated K-theory comprises the K-theory of various subquotients together with\nall canonical maps between these groups. We will make this definition precise later.\nThe part of it which involves the exact sequences (1.3) appeared previously in the\nwork of Gunnar Restorff [11] for Cuntz\u2013Krieger algebras and of Mikael R\u00f8rdam [13]\nand Alexander Bonkat [2] for extensions of C\u2217 -algebras. The UCT theorem in the\ncase when the ideal structure is given by I1 \u22b3I2 \u22b3A was obtained by Gunnar Restorff\nin his phd-thesis [12], where he introduced an invariant which is a particular case\nof filtrated K-theory.\nIn this paper we prove the following\nTheorem 1.1. The filtrated K-theory satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem\nand is a complete invariant for C\u2217 -algebras over those finite topological spaces with\na totally ordered lattice of open subsets.\nNote that a C\u2217 -algebra over a space of the type described in this result is essentially the same as a C\u2217 -algebra A together with a finite increasing chain of ideals\n{0} = I0 \u22b3 I1 \u22b3 I2 \u22b3 I3 \u22b3 * * * \u22b3 In\u22121 \u22b3 In = A.\nWe will also show that the spectral sequence associated to the filtrated K-theory\ndoes not collapse in general. Let (X, <) be the partially ordered set, where X =\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n3\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4} with the partial order given by 1, 2, 3 < 4 and no further strict inequalities\nbetween 1, 2, 3. A C\u2217 -algebra over this space is a C\u2217 -algebra A together with an\nideal I and a decomposition of A/I into a direct sum of three orthogonal ideals.\nTheorem 1.2. The filtrated K-theory over (X, <) does not satisfy the Universal\nCoefficient Theorem and is not a complete invariant.\nIn fact, we give an explicit example of two C\u2217 -algebras A and B over X in the\nbootstrap class that have isomorphic filtrated K-theory but are not KK(X)-equivalent.\nHowever, for the particular four-point space X, we still get a complete invariant and a Universal Coefficient Theorem as in (1.2), by adding another K-theory\nfunctor to filtrated K-theory.\nIt is not clear how to construct such an enriched and still computable filtrated\nK-theory for general finite spaces.\n1.3. The general machinery. Now we explain the general machinery behind our\napproach. Let us fix a finite topological space X. The first step is the correct\n\u2217\ndefinition of filtrated K-theory. The filtrated K-theory\n\u0001 of a C -algebra A over X\ncomprises the Z/2-graded Abelian groups K\u2217 A(Y ) for all locally closed subsets\nY \u2286 X together with all natural transformations between these groups. The main\nissue here is to find all natural transformations. These natural transformations\nenter in the definition of the target category of the filtrated K-theory functor and\nthus influence the Hom and Ext terms that we expect in the Universal Coefficient\nTheorem.\nWe can guess some of these natural transformations. If U is a relatively open\nsubset of Y , then A(U ) is an ideal in A(Y ), with quotient A(Y )/A(U ) = A(Y \\ U ).\nThis C\u2217 -algebra extension leads to a natural six-term exact sequence\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n/ K0 A(Y )\n/ K0 A(Y \\ U )\nK0 A(U )\nO\n(1.4)\n\u000f\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK1 A(Y \\ U ) o\nK1 A(Y ) o\nK1 A(U ) .\n\nThese exact sequences provide three types of natural transformations associated to\ninclusions of open subsets, restriction to closed subset, and boundary maps.\nAn obvious source for relations between these natural transformations are morphisms of C\u2217 -algebra extensions: since the six-term exact sequences in (1.4) are natural, each natural morphism of extensions provides some commuting diagrams,\nwhich become relations between our generators.\nBut do these obvious generators and relations already describe all natural transformations? This turns out to be the case for the spaces studied in this article-both\nthe positive and the negative examples. Although the authors know no counterexamples, we do not expect this to be so in general.\nThe starting point\n\u0001 for our study of filtrated K-theory is that the covariant functors A 7\u2192 K\u2217 A(Y ) are representable, that is, they are of the form KK\u2217 (X; RY , A)\nfor suitable C\u2217 -algebras RY over X-these are the representing objects. Our construction of RY yields commutative C\u2217 -algebras, consisting of C0 -functions on suitable locally closed subspaces of the order complex of the partial order\n\u0001 on X. The\u0001\nA(Y\n)\nto K\u2217 A(Z)\nYoneda Lemma tells us that natural transformations\nfrom\nK\n\u2217\n\u0001\ncorrespond to KK\u2217 (X; RZ , RY ) \u223c\n= K\u2217 RY (Z) . These groups are easy enough to\ncompute in the examples we consider, and turn out to be definable by the concrete\ngenerators and relations mentioned above.\nThe natural transformations acting on filtrated K-theory form a Z/2-graded preadditive category N T . A (countable) module over N T is, by definition, an additive\n\n\f4\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nfunctor from N T to the category of (countable) Z/2-graded Abelian groups. By\nconstruction, the filtrated K-theory of any C\u2217 -algebra over X is such a countable\nmodule. Let C be the category of countable N T -modules. This is an Abelian category, and filtrated K-theory is a stable homological functor FK from the Kasparov\ncategory KK(X) of C\u2217 -algebras over X to C.\nIt is easy to check that the functor FK : KK(X) \u2192 C is universal in the notation\nof [9]. General results on homological ideals in triangulated categories now produce a cohomological spectral sequence that converges towards KK\u2217 (X; A,\n\u0001 B) if A\n.\nbelongs to the bootstrap class; its E 2 -term involves ExtpC FK(A), FK(B)\n\u0001\nThe main issue is whether the Ext-groups ExtpC FK(A), FK(B) with p \u2265 2\nvanish, so that our spectral sequence degenerates to an exact sequence of the desired\nform. This amounts to checking whether FK(A) has a projective resolution of\nlength 1 in C.\nAlready for the non-Hausdorff two-point space considered in [2, 13], the category C has infinite cohomological dimension, that is, there are objects that admit\nno projective resolution of finite length. But these objects do not belong to the\nrange of the functor FK. If an N T -module A belongs to the range of FK, then\nthere are exact sequences\n(1.5)\n\n* * * \u2192 A(U ) \u2192 A(Y ) \u2192 A(Y \\ U ) \u2192 A(U ) \u2192 * * *\n\nfor any Y \u2208 LC(X), U \u2208 LC(Y ) because of (1.4). But there are N T -modules\nwithout finite length projective resolutions. For totally ordered spaces, an object\nof C has a projective resolution of length 1 if and only if it has a projective resolution\nof finite length, if and only if the sequences (1.5) are exact, if and only if it is the\nfiltrated K-theory of some separable C\u2217 -algebra over X, which we can take in the\nbootstrap class.\nFor the four-point counterexample considered in Section 5, we first find a torsionfree exact module that is not projective, and then use it to find an exact module\nwithout projective resolutions of length 1. Then we find two non-isomorphic objects\nof the bootstrap class with the same filtrated K-theory. The idea here is to consider\na certain exact triangle \u03a3C \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C, which splits on the level of filtrated\nK-theory, so that A \u2295 C and B have the same filtrated K-theory. But we can prove\nin our concrete example that A \u2295 C and B are not KK(X)-equivalent.\nA C\u2217 -algebra over the four-point space X is a C\u2217 -algebra A with a distinguished\nideal I and a direct sum decomposition of A/I as a direct sum of three orthogonal\nideals. Since both direct sums and extensions of C\u2217 -algebras can be classified\nby filtrated K-theory, it is remarkable that the combination of both provides a\ncounterexample. Incidentally, the space X op that corresponds to a C\u2217 -algebra A\nwith a distinguished ideal I and a direct sum decomposition of I as a direct sum of\nthree orthogonal ideals also leads to a counterexample in a similar fashion.\nFor the four-point space X above, there is essentially just one module that ought\nto be projective but is not. We can add another invariant to filtrated K-theory that\ncorresponds to this offending module. Since this changes our whole category, it may\nlead to further offending modules, which would have to be added in a second step,\nand this could, in principle, go on forever. But in the concrete case at hand, we get\nprojective resolutions of length 1 for all modules over the enriched filtrated K-theory.\nAs a result, the enriched filtrated K-theory classifies objects of the bootstrap class\nover X up to KK(X)-equivalence, and it classifies purely infinite separable nuclear\nstable C\u2217 -algebras with primitive ideal space X and simple subquotients in the\nbootstrap class.\n1.4.

For finite\nspaces, sobriety is equivalent to the separation axiom T0 , that is, two points are\nequal once they have the same closure.\nA C\u2217 -algebra over X is pair (A, \u03c8) consisting of a C\u2217 -algebra A and a continuous\nmap \u03c8 : Prim(A) \u2192 X.

Filtrated K-theory\nLet X be a finite topological space. We do not discuss filtrated K-theory for\nC\u2217 -algebras over infinite spaces here.\nDefinition 2.1. For a locally closed subset Y \u2286 X, we define a functor\n\u0001\nFKY : KK(X) \u2192 AbZ/2 ,\nFKY (A) := K\u2217 A(Y ) .\n\nHere Ab denotes the category of Abelian groups and AbZ/2 denotes the category of\nZ/2-graded Abelian groups.\nFor each Y \u2208 LC(X), the functor FKY is stable and homological, that is, it\nintertwines the suspension on KK(X) with the translation functor on AbZ/2 (this\nfunctor shifts the grading), and if \u03a3C \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C is an exact triangle in\nKK(X)-this may, for instance, come from a semi-split extension A \u058c B \u0589 C-\nthen FKY (A) \u2192 FKY (B) \u2192 FKY (C) is an exact sequence in AbZ/2 .\nThe functors FKY together form the filtrated K-theory functor. But the latter\nalso includes its target category, which we now define in a rather abstract way.\nDefinition 2.2. For Y, Z \u2208 LC(X), let N T \u2217 (Y, Z) be the Z/2-graded Abelian\ngroup of all natural transformations FKY \u21d2 FKZ . The composition of natural\ntransformations provides a product\nN T i (Y, Z) \u00d7 N T j (W, Y ) \u2192 N T i+j (W, Z),\n\nf, g 7\u2192 f \u25e6 g,\n\nwhich is associative and additive in each variable.\nWe let N T be the Z/2-graded category whose object set is LC and whose morphism space Y \u2192 Z is N T \u2217 (Y, Z). The Abelian group structure on these morphism\nspaces turns this into a pre-additive category.\nDefinition 2.3. A module over N T is a grading preserving, additive functor\nG : N T \u2192 AbZ/2 . That is, it consists of a family of Z/2-graded Abelian groups\nGY = (GY,0 , GY,1 ) for Y \u2208 LC(X) and product maps\nN T i (Y, Z) \u00d7 GY,j \u2192 GZ,i+j\nfor all Y, Z \u2208 LC(X), i, j \u2208 Z/2; these product maps are associative, additive in\neach variable, and the identity transformations in N T (Y, Y ) act identically on GY\nfor all Y \u2208 LC(X).\nLet Mod(N T ) be the category of N T -modules. The morphisms in Mod(N T )\nare the natural transformations of functors or, equivalently, families of grading\npreserving group homomorphisms GY \u2192 G\u2032Y that commute with the actions of N T .\nLet Mod(N T )c be the full subcategory of countable modules.\nBy construction, the natural transformations FKY \u21d2 FKZ in N T \u2217\u0001(Y, Z) induce\nmaps FKY (A) \u2192 FKZ (A) for all A \u2208\u2208 KK(X). This turns FKY (A) Y \u2208LC(X) into\na module over N T . Furthermore, it is well-known that the K-theory of separable\nC\u2217 -algebras such as A(Y ) for A \u2208\u2208 KK(X) is countable.\nDefinition 2.4. Filtrated K-theory is the functor\nFK = (FKY )Y \u2208LC(X) : KK(X) \u2192 Mod(N T )c ,\n\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\nA 7\u2192 K\u2217 A(Y )\n\nY \u2208LC(X)\n\n.\n\nThe target category Mod(N T )c is an important part of this definition because\nwe will compute groups of morphisms and extensions in this category.\nSince A(\u2205) = {0} for all C\u2217 -algebras over X, we have FK\u2205 = 0, so that \u2205 is a\nzero object of N T . Therefore, G\u2205 vanishes for any N T -module.\nIf Y \u2208 LC(X) is not connected, that is, Y = Y1 \u2294 Y2 with two disjoint relatively open subsets Y1 , Y2 \u2208 O(Y ) \u2286 LC(X), then A(Y ) \u223c\n= A(Y1 ) \u2295 A(Y2 ) for any\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n7\n\n\u223c FKY (A) \u00d7 FKY (A).

Therefore, any N T -module has GY \u223c\n= GY1 \u2295 GY2 ;\nhere we use the fact that a functor that is additive on morphisms is also additive\non objects, even if the category in question is only pre-additive.\nSince X is finite, any locally closed subset is a disjoint union of its\nLconnected\ncomponents. This corresponds to a direct sum decomposition Y \u223c\n=\nj\u2208\u03c00 (Y ) Yj\nin N T . Therefore, we lose no information when we replace LC(X) by the subset\nLC(X)\u2217 of non-empty, connected, locally closed subsets.\n2.1. The representability theorem. The representability theorem serves two\npurposes. We will first use it to describe the category N T . Later, we use it to\nconstruct geometric resolutions in KK(X).\nTheorem 2.5. Let X be a finite topological space. The covariant functors FKY for\nY \u2208 LC(X) are representable, that is, there are objects RY \u2208\u2208 KK(X) and natural\nisomorphisms\n\u0001\nKK\u2217 (X; RY , A) \u223c\n= FKY (A) = K\u2217 A(Y )\nfor all A \u2208\u2208 KK(X), Y \u2208 LC(X).\nBefore we prove this theorem in \u00a72.2, we first describe the representing objects RY explicitly, and we use this to describe the groups of natural transformations\nN T \u2217 (Y, Z) as K-theory groups of certain locally compact spaces.\nThe construction of RY requires some preparation. We equip X with the specialisation preorder \u0016 as in [8, \u00a72.7]; recall that x \u0016 y if and only if {x} \u2286 {y}.\nSince the topological space X is finite, it carries the Alexandrov topology of the\npreorder \u0016, that is, a subset Y \u2286 X is open if and only if x \u0017 y \u2208 Y implies x \u2208 Y .\nSimilarly, Y \u2286 X is closed if and only if x \u0016 y \u2208 Y implies x \u2208 Y , and locally\nclosed if and only if x \u0016 y \u0016 z and x, z \u2208 Y implies y \u2208 Y .\nDefinition 2.6. Let (X, \u0016) be a partially ordered set. Its order complex is the\ngeometric realisation of the simplicial set Ch(X) whose n-simplices are the chains\nx0 \u0016 x1 \u0016 * * * \u0016 xn in X and whose face and degeneracy maps delete or double an\nentry of the chain.\nEquivalently, Ch(X) is the classifying space of the thin category that has object\nset X and a morphism x \u2192 y whenever x \u0016 y.\nThe order complex is the main ingredient in the construction of the representing\nobjects RY for Y \u2208 LC(X).\nThe non-degenerate n-simplices in Ch(X) are the strict chains x0 \u227a * * * \u227a xn\nin X. We let SX be the set of all strict chains. For each I = (x0 \u227a * * * \u227a xn ) \u2208 SX ,\nwe let \u2206I be a copy of \u2206n ; more formally, \u2206I = {(t, I) | t \u2208 \u2206n }. We also let\n\u2206\u25e6I \u2286 \u2206I be the corresponding open simplex \u2206n `\n\\ \u2202\u2206n .\nThe space Ch(X) is obtained from the union I\u2208SX \u2206I by identifying \u2206I with\nthe corresponding face in \u2206J whenever I, J \u2208 SX satisfy I \u2286 J. Thus the underlying set of Ch(X) is a disjoint union\na\n\u2206\u25e6I .\n(2.1)\nCh(X) =\nI\u2208SX\n\nFor I \u2208 SX , let min I and max I be the (unique) minimal and maximal elements\nin SX , respectively. We define two functions\nm, M : Ch(X) \u2192 X\n\u2206\u25e6I\n\nby mapping points in\nto min I and max I, respectively. This well-defines functions on Ch(X) because of (2.1).\n\n\f8\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nLemma 2.7. If Y \u2286 X is closed, then m\u22121 (Y ) is open and M \u22121 (Y ) is closed in\nCh(X). If Y \u2286 X is open, then m\u22121 (Y ) is closed and M \u22121 (Y ) is open. If Y \u2286 X\nis locally closed, then m\u22121 (Y ) and M \u22121 (Y ) are locally closed.\nProof. First we show that M \u22121 (Y ) is closed if Y is closed. If I \u2208 SX satisfies\nmax I \u2208 Y , then max J \u2208 Y for all J \u2286 I because max J \u0016 max I \u2208 Y . Hence\n\u2206I \u2286 M \u22121 (Y ) once M \u22121 (Y ) \u2229 \u2206\u25e6I 6= \u2205, so that M \u22121 (Y ) \u2229 \u2206I is closed for all\nI \u2208 SX ; this implies that M \u22121 (Y ) is closed.\nA similar argument shows that m\u22121 (Y ) is closed in Ch(X) if Y is open. Now\nthe remaining assertions follow easily because the maps m\u22121 and M \u22121 commute\nwith complements, unions, and intersections.\n\u0003\nMore explicitly, if Y \u2286 X is open, then m\u22121 (Y ) is the union of the simplices SX\nfor all chains x0 \u227a x1 \u227a * * * \u227a xn with x0 \u2208 Y and hence x0 , . . . , xn \u2208 Y . Thus\nm\u22121 (Y ) = Ch(Y )\n\nif Y \u2286 X is open.\n\nM \u22121 (Y ) = Ch(Y )\n\nif Y \u2286 X is closed.\n\nSimilarly,\nHere we identify Ch(Y ) with a subcomplex of Ch(X) in the obvious way.\nLet X op be X with the topology for the reversed partial order \u227b; that is, the\nopen subsets of X op are the closed subsets of X, and vice versa. We may rephrase\nLemma 2.7 as follows:\nProposition 2.8. The map (m, M ) : Ch(X) \u2192 X op \u00d7 X is continuous.\nLet\n\n\u0001\nR := C Ch(X)\n\nbe the C\u2217 -algebra of continuous functions on Ch(X). Since\n\u0001\nPrim R = Prim C Ch(X) \u223c\n= Ch(X),\n\nthe map (m, M ) turns R into a C\u2217 -algebra over X op \u00d7 X. We abbreviate\nS(Y, Z) := m\u22121 (Y ) \u2229 M \u22121 (Z) \u2286 Ch(X);\nthis is a locally closed subset of Ch(X) by Lemma 2.7\nDefinition 2.9. We let RY be the C\u2217 -algebra over X with\n\u0001\nRY (Z) := R(Y op \u00d7 Z) = C0 S(Y, Z)\n\nfor all Y, Z \u2208 LC(X); here Y op denotes Y with the subspace topology from X op .\nEquivalently, we let RY be the restriction of R to Y op \u00d7 X, viewed as a C\u2217 -algebra\nover X via the coordinate projection Y op \u00d7 X \u2192 X.\nWe will prove the Theorem 2.5 for this choice of RY in \u00a72.2. Taking this for\ngranted, we use the concrete description of RY to compute the groups of natural\ntransformations. By the Yoneda Lemma, natural transformations between the functors FKY come from morphisms between the representing objects. More precisely,\n\u0001\n(2.2) N T \u2217 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= KK\u2217 (X; RZ , RY ) \u223c\n= FKZ (RY ) = K\u2217 RY (Z)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= K\u2217 R(Y op \u00d7 Z) = K\u2217 m\u22121 (Y ) \u2229 M \u22121 (Z) = K\u2217 S(Y, Z) .\nBy the way, the universal property of Kasparov theory says that it makes no\ndifference for the natural transformations FKY \u21d2 FKZ whether we view these two\nfunctors as defined on C\u2217 sep(X) or KK(X). But since RY only represents FKY on\nthe level of KK(X), we get KK\u2217 (X; RZ , RY ) and not the space of X-equivariant\n\u2217\n-homomorphisms RZ \u2192 RY .\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n9\n\nWe describe S(Y, Z) more explicitly using the closure and boundary operations\nZ := {x \u2208 X | there is z \u2208 Z with x \u0016 z},\n\n\u2202Z := Z \\ Z,\n\nYe := {x \u2208 X | there is y \u2208 Y with x \u0017 y},\n\ne := Ye \\ Y.\n\u2202Y\n\nOf course, Z is the closure of Z in X and Ye is the closure of Y in X op .\nLemma 2.10.

Let x0 \u227a x1 \u227a * * * \u227a xn be a strict chain in X. The interior of the corresponding simplex belongs to S(Y, Z) if and only if x0 \u2208 Y and xn \u2208 Z. This implies\nxj \u2208 Ye and xj \u2208 Z for all j, so that the simplex belongs to Ch(Ye \u2229Z). Furthermore,\ne \u2229 Z for all j nor xj \u2208 Ye \u2229 \u2202Z for all j because x0 \u2208 Y\nwe neither have xj \u2208 \u2202Y\ne \u2229 Z).\nand xn \u2208 Z. Thus the simplex belongs neither to Ch(Ye \u2229 \u2202Z) nor to Ch(\u2202Y\ne\ne\nConversely, if xj \u2208 Y \u2229 Z for all j and neither xj \u2208 \u2202Y \u2229 Z for all j nor xj \u2208 Ye \u2229 \u2202Z\nfor all j, then some xj must belong to Y \u2229 Z and some xk must belong to Ye \u2229 Z.\nSince Y \u2229 Z is closed in Ye \u2229 Z and Ye \u2229 Z is open in Ye \u2229 Z, this implies x0 \u2208 Y and\nxn \u2208 Z.

The extension (2.4) is semi-split in C\u2217 alg(X)\nand hence has a class in KK1 (X; RU , RZ ) and produces an exact triangle\n\u03a3RU \u2192 RZ \u2192 RY \u2192 RU\n\n(2.5)\nin KK(X).\n\nLemma 2.11. The maps in the extension triangle (2.5) correspond to the natural\ntransformations FKU [1] \u21d0 FKZ \u21d0 FKY \u21d0 FKU in (1.4).\nProof. The natural transformation \u03bcYU : FKU \u21d2 FKY in (1.4) is induced by the\nnatural \u2217 -homomorphism j : A(U ) \u2192 A(Y ). For A = RU , this map\n\u0001 is invertible\nbecause S(U, Y ) = S(U, U ) = Ch(U ). Hence j(\u03beU ) \u2208 K0 S(U, Y ) is again the\nclass of the trivial vector bundle on Ch(U ); this class corresponds to the natural\ntransformation \u03bcYU . The restriction map RY \u0589 RU in (2.4) maps [\u03beY ] to [\u03beU ]-\nrecall that both [\u03beY ] and [\u03beU ] are trivial vector bundles. Hence the restriction map\nRY \u0589 RU and the natural transformation \u03bcZ\nY correspond to \u0001the same class-the\n1-dimensional trivial vector bundle on Ch(U )-in K0 S(U, Y ) .\nSimilarly, the natural transformation \u03bcZ\nY : FKY \u21d2 FKZ is induced by the natural \u2217 -homomorphism p : A(Y\n)\n\u0589\nA(Z).\n\u0001\n\u0001 For A = RY , this is the restriction\n\u2217\n-homomorphism C Ch(Y ) \u2192 C Ch(Z) because S(Y, Y ) = Ch(Y ) and S(Y, Z) =\nCh(Z). Since the restriction of a trivial bundle remains trivial, \u03bcZ\nY corresponds\nto the trivial 1-dimensional vector bundle on S(Y, Z) = Ch(Z). The embedding\nRZ \u0589 RY restricts to an identity map on Z because S(Z, Z) = S(Z, Y ) = Ch(Z).\nSince this maps [\u03beZ ] to the trivial bundle, the embedding RZ \u0589 RY and \u03bcZ\nY both\ncorrespond \u0001to the same class-the 1-dimensional trivial vector bundle on Ch(Z)-in\nK0 S(Y, Z) .\nU\nFinally, we study the boundary map \u03b4Z\n: FKZ \u21d2 FKU [1]. We claim that it\ncorresponds to the class of the extension RZ \u058c RY \u0589 RU in KK1 (X; RU , RZ ).\nTo prove this, we use that Ch(Y ) is the join of the spaces Ch(U ) and Ch(Z), so\nthat there is a continuous map f : Ch(Y ) \u2192 [0, 1] whose fibres over 0 and 1 are\nCh(U ) and Ch(Z), respectively.\nMore precisely, let x0 \u227a x1 \u227a * * * \u227a xn be a strict chain in Y and let \u03be be a point\nof the corresponding simplex with coordinates (t0 , . . . , tn ) with t0 + * * * + tn = 1,\nthat is, \u03be = t0 x0 + * * * + tn xn . Then there is j \u2208 {0, . . . , n} with x0 , . . . , xj \u2208 U ,\nxj+1 , . . . , xn \u2208 Z. We can, therefore, write \u03be = tU \u03beU + tZ \u03beZ with\nt0 x0 + * * * + tj xj\n\u2208 Ch(U ),\ntU\ntj+1 xj+1 + * * * + tn xn\n\u03beZ =\n\u2208 Ch(Z),\ntZ\n\n\u03beU =\n\ntU = t0 + * * * + tj ,\ntZ = tj+1 + * * * + tn .\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n11\n\nWe define a continuous map f : Ch(Y ) \u2192 [0, 1] by \u03be 7\u2192 tZ . We have\nS(U, U ) = Ch(U ) = f \u22121 (0),\n\nS(Z, Z) = Ch(Z) = f \u22121 (1)\n\nby construction, and hence\n\u0001\n\u0001\nS(Z, U ) = Ch(Y ) \\ Ch(U ) \u2294 Ch(Z) = f \u22121 (0, 1) .\n\nNow we can compute some boundary maps. The boundary map\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK0 S(Z, Z) \u223c\n= K1 S(Z, U )\n= K0 RZ (Z) \u2192 K1 RZ (U ) \u223c\n\nmaps the class of\u0001 the trivial bundle [\u03beZ ] to f \u2217 (\u03b4), where \u03b4 denotes a generator\nof Z \u223c\n= K1 (0, 1) ; this follows from the naturality of the boundary map. The\nboundary map\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK0 S(U, U ) \u223c\n= K1 S(Z, U )\n= K0 RU (U ) \u2192 K1 RZ (U ) \u223c\n\nfor the extension RZ \u058c RY \u0589 RU maps the class of the trivial bundle [\u03beU ] to\n\u2212f \u2217 (\u03b4), again by naturality of the boundary map.\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0001\nRemark 2.12. The proof also describes the classes in K0 S(U, Y ) , K0 S(Y, Z) ,\n\u0001\nand K1 S(Z, U ) that correspond to the natural transformations in (1.4). The\nnatural transformations FKU \u21d2 FKY and FKY \u21d2 FKZ are represented by the\nclasses of the trivial vector bundles over the compact spaces S(U, Y ) and S(Y, Z);\nthe natural \u0001boundary map FKZ \u21d2 FKU [1] is represented by f \u2217 (\u03b4) for a generator\nof K1 (0, 1) .\n\n2.2. Proof of Theorem 2.5.\n\u0001 We check first that the natural transformation\nKK\u2217 (X; RY , A) \u2192 K\u2217 A(Y ) induced by \u03beY is an isomorphism if Y is the minimal open subset Ux containing some point x \u2208 X. The adjointness relation\n\u0001\nKK\u2217 (X; ix (A), B) \u223c\n= KK\u2217 A, B(Ux )\nfor all B \u2208\u2208 KK(X) established in [8, Proposition 3.12] yields\n\u0001\nKK\u2217 (X; ix (C), B) \u223c\n= KK\u2217 C, B(Ux ) = FKUx (B),\n\nthat is, ix (C) represents FKUx . To check that RUx does so as well, we must show\nthat ix (C) and RUx are KK(X)-equivalent.\n\u2286\n\u223c {x} \u2212\nRecall that ix (C) = (C, x), where x denotes the map Prim(C) =\n\u2192 X, and\n(\nC if x \u2208 Z,\nix (C)(Z) =\n0 otherwise\nfor all Z \u2208 LC(X).\nSince Ux = {y \u2208 X | x \u0016 y}, the preordered set Ux has a minimal point,\nnamely x. Therefore, the space Ch(Ux ) is starlike and hence contractible in a\ncanonical way towards x. The path from a point in \u2206I for I \u2208 SUx to the base\npoint in \u2206x lies in \u2206I\u222a{x} . Since max I \u222a {x} = max I, the contraction preserves\nthe ideals \u0001RUx (V ) for V \u2208 O(X), so that we get a homotopy equivalence between\nC Ch(Ux ) and ix (C) in C\u2217 alg(X). Thus RUx corepresents FKUx as well. It is easy\nto see that the natural isomorphism KK\u2217 (X; RUx , ) \u223c\n= FKUx is induced by \u03beUx .\nLet Good \u2286 LC(X) be the set of all Z \u2208 LC(X) for which the natural transformation KK\u2217 (X; RZ , A) \u2192 FKZ (A) induced by \u03beZ is an isomorphism. We must\nshow Good = LC(X). We have just seen that Ux \u2208 Good for all x \u2208 X.\nLet Y \u2208 LC(X) and U \u2208 O(Y ); we claim that all three of U , Y , and Y \\ U\nare good once two of them are. This follows from the Five Lemma because the\n\n\f12\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nmaps induced by \u03beZ for Z = U, Y, Y \\ U intertwine the maps in the six-term exact\nsequences (1.4) and\nKK0 (X; RU , A)\nO\n\n/ KK0 (X; RY , A)\n\n/ KK0 (X; RY \\U , A)\n\nKK1 (X; RY \\U , A) o\n\nKK1 (X; RY , A) o\n\n\u000f\nKK1 (X; RU , A)\n\nfor any A \u2208\u2208 KK(X); the latter six-term exact sequence is induced by the semisplit extension (2.5). The commutativity of the relevant diagrams follows from the\ncomputations in the proof of Lemma 2.11 (which do not depend on Theorem 2.5).\nThe two-out-of-three property of Good implies:\nU, V \u2208 O(X),\n\nU, V, U \u2229 V \u2208 Good\n\n=\u21d2\n\nU \u222a V \u2208 Good\n\nbecause (U \u222a V ) \\ U = V \\ (U \u2229 V ). By induction on the length of U , this implies\nthat all open subsets of X belong to Good. Since any locally closed subset is a\ndifference of two open subsets, we conclude that Good = LC(X). This finishes the\nproof of Theorem 2.5.\n3. An example\nIn this section, we restrict our attention to a special class of spaces, namely, the\nspaces X = {1, . . . , n} totally ordered by \u2264 for n \u2208 N. We let\n[a, b] := {x \u2208 X | a \u2264 x \u2264 b}.\nfor a, b \u2208 Z. We equip X with the Alexandrov topology, so that the open subsets\nare [a, n] for all a \u2208 X; the closed subsets are [1, b] with b \u2208 X, and the locally\nclosed subsets are those of the form [a, b] with a, b \u2208 X and a \u2264 b. Any locally\nclosed subset of X is connected.\n3.1. Computations with the order complex. Since any subset of X is totally\nordered, the space Ch([a, b]) is just a closed simplex of dimension b \u2212 a for any\nb \u2265 a. We denote the corresponding face of Ch(X) by \u2206[a,b] . This is understood\nto be empty for a > b.\nFrom now on, we let\nY = [a1 , b1 ],\n\nZ = [a2 , b2 ],\n\nwith 1 \u2264 a1 \u2264 b1 \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 a2 \u2264 b2 \u2264 n.\n\ne = [b1 + 1, n], Z = [1, b2 ], and \u2202Z = [1, a2 \u2212 1]. Lemma 2.10\nThen Ye = [a1 , n], \u2202Y\nyields\n\u0001\nS(Y, Z) = \u2206[a1 ,b2 ] \\ \u2206[a1 ,a2 \u22121] \u222a \u2206[b1 +1,b2 ] .\nNow we distinguish three cases:\n\nCase 1: If a2 \u2264 a1 \u2264 b2 \u2264 b1 , then S(Y, Z)\n\u0001 = \u2206[a1 ,b2 ] is a non-empty closed simplex.\nHence N T \u2217 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= K\u2217 S(Y, Z) \u223c\n= Z[0] (this means Z in degree 0).\nCase 2: If a2 \u2212 1 \u2264 b1 , a1 < a2 , and b1 < b2 , then S(Y, Z) is obtained from a closed\nsimplex by removing two \u0001disjoint, non-empty closed faces. Excision yields\nN T \u2217 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= K\u2217 S(Y, Z) \u223c\n= Z[1] (this means Z in degree 1).\nCase 3: In all other cases, S(Y, Z) is either empty, a difference of two closed simplices, or a difference \u03c3 \\ (\u03c41 \u222a \u03c42 ) for two non-empty closed faces \u03c41 and \u03c42\nof a simplex \u03c3 that intersect. Then\n\u03c41 \u222a \u03c42 and \u03c3 are both contractible, so\n\u0001\nthat N T \u2217 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= K\u2217 S(Y, Z) \u223c\n= 0.\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n13\n\nSumming up, we get\n(3.1)\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2Z[0] if a2 \u2264 a1 \u2264 b2 \u2264 b1 ,\nN T \u2217 (Y, Z) = Z[1] if a2 \u2212 1 \u2264 b1 , a1 < a2 , and b1 < b2 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise.\n\n3.2. Products of natural transformations. Our next task is to identify the\nnatural transformations that correspond to the generators of the groups in (3.1);\nthis also allows us to compute products in N T .\nFirst we study the grading preserving transformations that appear in the first\ncase. We introduce a partial order \u2265 and a strict partial order \u226b on LC(X) by\n[a1 , b1 ] \u2265 [a2 , b2 ]\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\na1 \u2265 a2 and b1 \u2265 b2 ,\n\n[a1 , b1 ] \u226b [a2 , b2 ]\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\na1 > b 2 .\n\nOur computation shows that N T 0 (Y, Z) 6= {0} if and only if Y \u2265 Z but not\nY \u226b Z. This is equivalent to Y \u2229 Z being non-empty, closed in Y , and open in Z.\nUnder these assumptions, there is a natural non-zero \u2217 -homomorphism given by\nthe composition\n\u03bcZ\nY : A(Y ) \u0589 A(Y \u2229 Z) \u058c A(Z)\nbecause A(Y \u2229 Z) is a quotient of A(Y ) and an ideal in A(Z). The natural transformation FKY \u21d2 FKZ induced by \u03bcZ\nY maps \u03beY \u2208 FKY,0 (RY ), which is the class\nof the trivial line bundle over S(Y, Y ) = \u2206[a1 ,b1 ] , to the trivial line bundle over\n\u0001\nS(Y, Z) = \u2206[a1 ,b2 ] . Since this is the generator of FKZ,0 (RY ) = K0 S(Y, Z) \u223c\n= Z[0],\nthe natural transformation \u03bcZ\nY generates N T 0 (Y, Z).\nIf Y \u226b Z, then we let \u03bcZ\nY : A(Y ) \u2192 A(Z) be the zero map, which induces the zero\nY\nZ\ntransformation FKY \u21d2 FKZ . With this convention, we get \u03bcZ\nY \u25e6 \u03bcW = \u03bcW for all\nY, Z, W \u2208 LC(X) with W \u2265 Y \u2265 Z, also if W \u226b Z; this equation holds on the level\nof \u2217 -homomorphisms and, therefore, also for the induced natural transformations.\nWe can sum this up as follows:\nLemma 3.1. The category N T 0 of grading-preserving natural transformations\nFKY \u21d2 FKZ for Y, Z \u2208 LC(X) is the pre-additive category generated by natural\nZ\nY\nZ\ntransformations \u03bcZ\nY : FKY \u21d2 FKZ for all Y \u2265 Z with the relations \u03bcY \u25e6 \u03bcW = \u03bcW\nZ\nfor W \u2265 Y \u2265 Z and \u03bcY = 0 for Y \u226b Z.\nThis list of generators is longer than necessary. Clearly, we can write any \u03bcZ\nY\n[a,b\u22121]\n[a\u22121,b]\nfor\nas a product of the transformations \u03bc[a,b] for 2 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 n and \u03bc[a,b]\n1 \u2264 a < b \u2264 n. Moreover, these transformations themselves are indecomposable,\nthat is, they cannot be written themselves as products in a non-trivial way.\nNow we turn to the natural transformations of degree 1. For any b \u2208 X and any\nC\u2217 -algebra A over X, we have a natural C\u2217 -algebra extension\nA([b, n]) \u058c A([1, n]) \u0589 A([1, b \u2212 1]),\nwhich generates an odd natural transformation\n\u03b4b : FK[1,b\u22121] \u21d2 FK[b,n] .\nComposing with the grading preserving natural transformations \u03bc above, we get a\nnatural transformation of degree 1\n(3.2)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b4a\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\u21d2 FK[a2 ,b2 ] = FKZ\nFK[a2 ,n] =\n\u03b4YZ : FKY = FK[a1 ,b1 ] =\n\u21d2 FK[1,a2 \u22121] ==\u21d2\n\nwhenever b1 \u2265 a2 \u2212 1.\nEquation (3.1) predicts that this transformation vanishes if a1 \u2265 a2 or b1 \u2265 b2 .\nThis can be verified as follows. Vanishing for a1 \u2265 a2 is clear because then [a1 , b1 ] \u226b\n[1, a2 \u22121]. By the naturality of the boundary map, the transformation in (3.2) agrees\n\n\f14\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nwith the composition of \u03bc : FK[a1 ,b1 ] \u21d2 FK[a1 ,a2 \u22121] with the boundary map for the\nextension\n(3.3)\n\nA([a2 , b2 ]) \u058c A([a1 , b2 ]) \u0589 A([a1 , a2 \u2212 1]).\n[a ,a \u22121]\n\nfactors through the quotient map in (3.3). But the\nIf b1 \u2265 b2 , then \u03bc[a11 ,b12]\ncomposite of two maps in a six-term exact sequence vanishes.\nEquation (3.2) produces a natural transformation \u03b4YZ \u2208 N T 1 (Y, Z) whenever\na1 < a2 , b1 < b2 , and a2 \u2212 1 \u2264 b1 , that is, whenever (3.1) predicts N T 1 (Y, Z)\nto be non-zero. We claim that \u03b4YZ generates this group. This follows because the\nnatural transformation \u03b4YZ maps\nthe class of the trivial line bundle over S(Y, Y ) to\n\u0001\nthe generator of K1 S(Y, Z) \u223c\nZ.\n=\nNotice that N T 1 ([a2 , n], Z) = {0} for any Z \u2208 LC(X). Since the natural transformation (3.2) above factors through FK[a2 ,n] , any product of two odd natural\ntransformations vanishes. Thus the category N T is a split extension of N T 0 by\nthe bimodule N T 1 . The bimodule structure on N T 1 is very simple: a product\nY\nZ\nY\nZ\n\u03bcZ\nY \u25e6 \u03b4W or \u03b4Y \u25e6 \u03bcW is equal to \u03b4W whenever all three natural transformations are\ndefined, and zero otherwise.\nExample 3.2. To make our constructions more concrete, we now consider the example n = 2, which corresponds to extensions of C\u2217 -algebras. There are only three\nnon-empty locally closed subsets: 1 = [1, 1], 12 = [1, 2], and 2 = [2, 2]. The order\ncomplex is an interval; we label its end points 1 and 2. The map (m, M ) from\nCh(X) = [1, 2] to X op \u00d7 X maps\n1 7\u2192 (1, 1),\n\n2 7\u2192 (2, 2),\n\n]1, 2[ 7\u2192 (1, 2).\n\nCorrespondingly, we have\nS(1, 1) = {1},\n\nS(1, 2) = ]1, 2[,\n\nS(1, 12) = [1, 2[,\n\nS(2, 1) = \u2205,\n\nS(2, 2) = {2},\n\nS(2, 12) = {2},\n\nS(12, 1) = {1},\n\nS(12, 2) = ]1, 2],\n\nS(12, 12) = [1, 2].\n\nTaking K-theory, we get\nN T (1, 1) = Z[0],\n\nN T (1, 2) = Z[1],\n\nN T (1, 12) = 0,\n\nN T (2, 1) = 0,\n\nN T (2, 2) = Z[0],\n\nN T (2, 12) = Z[0],\n\nN T (12, 1) = Z[0],\n\nN T (12, 2) = 0,\n\nN T (12, 12) = Z[0].\n\n3.3. Ring-theoretic properties of the natural transformations. We now observe some general ring-theoretic properties of N T for X = {1, . . . , n} with the\ntotal order. We exclude the trivial case n = 1. We may replace N T by a Z/2graded ring by taking the direct sum of N T \u2217 (Y, Z) for all Y, Z \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 and\ndefining the product as usual for a category ring. Then N T -modules become Z/2graded modules over this Z/2-graded ring, and ring-theoretic notions such as the\nJacobson radical and the balanced tensor product \u2297N T make sense.\nDefinition 3.3. Let N T nil \u2286 N T be the subgroup spanned by the natural transZ\nformations \u03bcZ\nY with Y 6= Z and \u03b4Y with arbitrary Y, Z.\nLet N T ss \u2286 N T be the subgroup spanned by the natural transformations \u03bcYY\nwith Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 .\nLemma 3.4. The subgroup N T nil is the maximal nilpotent ideal in N T , it is the\nnilradical and the Jacobson radical of N T . The subgroup N T ss is a semi-simple\nsubring, and N T decomposes as a semi-direct product N T nil \u22ca N T ss .\n\u2217\n\nProof. Since all \u03bcYY are idempotent, N T ss is a subring isomorphic to ZLC(X) with\npointwise multiplication. It is easy to see that N T nil is an ideal in N T . It is\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n15\n\nnilpotent, that is, N T knil = {0} for some k \u2208 N, because LC(X)\u2217 is finite and \u2265\nis a partial order on it. Since N T = N T nil \u2295 N T ss as Abelian groups, we get\nthe desired semi-direct product decomposition. Since the Jacobson radical of N T ss\nvanishes, N T nil is both the nilradical and the Jacobson radical of N T .\n\u0003\nWe are going to use Lemma 3.4 to characterise the projective N T -modules. This\ncharacterisation involves the following two definitions.\nDefinition 3.5. We call an N T -module M exact if the chain complexes\n\u03bcY\n\nU\n\u03b4Y\n\\U\n\nY \\U\n\n\u03bc\n\nU\nY\n* * * \u2192 M (U ) \u2212\u2212\u2192\nM (Y ) \u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2192 M (Y \\ U ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M (U ) \u2192 * * *\n\nare exact for all Y \u2208 LC(X), U \u2208 O(Y ) as in (1.5).\nProposition 3.6. Let K \u058c E \u0589 Q be an extension of N T -modules. If two of the\nmodules K, E, Q are exact, so is the third one.\nProof. Given U and Y as above and a module M , let C\u2022 (M ) be the chain complex\n* * * \u2192 M (U )[m] \u2192 M (Y )[m] \u2192 M (Y \\ U )[m] \u2192 M (U )[m \u2212 1] \u2192 * * * .\nThen C\u2022 (K) \u058c C\u2022 (E) \u0589 C\u2022 (Q) is an extension of chain complexes. The long\nexact homology sequence shows that all three of these chain complexes are exact\nonce two of them are exact.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.7.

The natural transformation \u03b4[a,b]\nis the longest natural transformation out of [a, b] in the following sense: it factors\nZ\nor \u03bcZ\nthrough \u03b4[a,b]\n[a,b] whenever the latter is defined and non-zero. Thus Lemma 3.8\nidentifies N T nil *M (Y ) with the largest proper subgroup of M (Y ) that is the kernel\nZ\nof some \u03b4[a,b]\nor \u03bcZ\n[a,b] .\nThe following proposition is a rather trivial variant of the Nakayama Lemma.\nUnlike in the usual Nakayama Lemma, we do not assume the module to be finitely\ngenerated. This is no problem because the relevant ideal N T nil is nilpotent.\nProposition 3.10. Let M be an N T -module with Mss = 0. Then M = 0.\nProof. By assumption, M = N T nil * M . By induction, this implies M = N T jnil * M\nfor all j \u2208 N. Since N T knil = 0 for some k, we get M = 0.\n\u0003\n3.4. Characterisation of free and projective modules.\nDefinition 3.11. For Y \u2208 LC(X), the free N T -module on Y is defined by\nPY (Z) := N T \u2217 (Y, Z)\n\nfor all Z \u2208 LC(X).\n\nAn N T -module is called free if it is isomorphic to a direct sum of degree-shifted\nfree modules PY [j], j \u2208 Z/2.\nTheorem 3.12. Let M be an N T -module. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) M is a free N T -module.\n(ii) M is a projective N T -module.\n(iii) Mss (Y ) = N T ss \u2297N T M (Y ) is a free Abelian group for all Y \u2208 LC(X) and\nT\nTorN\n1 (N T ss , M ) = 0.\n(iv) M (Y ) is a free Abelian group for all Y \u2208 LC(X) and M is exact.\nT\nHere TorN\ndenotes the first derived functor of \u2297N T . The first three conditions\n1\nremain equivalent when we replace N T by any ring that is a nilpotent extension of\nthe ring ZN for some N \u2208 N.\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n17\n\n\u223c M (Y ) for all Y \u2208 LC(X)\nProof. The Yoneda Lemma asserts that Hom(PY , M ) =\nand all N T -modules M . Hence free modules are projective, that is, (1)=\u21d2(2). A\nfunctor of the form M 7\u2192 R \u2297S M for a ring homomorphism S \u2192 R always maps\nfree modules to free modules and hence maps projective modules to projective modT\nules. Furthermore, derived functors like TorN\nautomatically vanish on projective\n1\nmodules. This yields the implication (2)=\u21d2(3). We are going to prove that (3)\nimplies (1).\nSince Mss (Y ) is a free Abelian group for all Y , Mss is a free module over N T ss \u223c\n=\n\u2217\nZLC(X) . Hence P := N T \u2297N T ss Mss is a free N T -module. The canonical projection\nM \u2192 Mss splits by an N T ss -module homomorphism because Mss is free. This\ninduces an N T -module homomorphism f : P \u2192 M because of the adjointness\nrelation\nHomN T (N T \u2297N T ss X, Y ) \u223c\n= HomN T ss (X, Y ).\n\u223c P is a free module as asserted. We have\nWe claim that f is invertible, so that M =\nPss = N T ss \u2297N T N T \u2297N T ss Mss \u223c\n= Mss .\n= N T ss \u2297N T ss Mss \u223c\nInspection shows that this isomorphism is induced by f . Since the functor M 7\u2192 Mss\nis right-exact, this implies coker(f )ss = 0 and hence coker(f ) = 0 by the Nakayama\nLemma (Proposition 3.10). That is, f is an epimorphism.\nLet K := ker(f ), then we get an exact sequence of N T -modules K \u058c P \u0589 M .\nThe derived functors of N T ss \u2297N T provide a long exact sequence\n(3.5)\n\nf\n\nT\n\u2192 Mss \u2192 0.\n0 \u2192 TorN\n1 (N T ss , M ) \u2192 Kss \u2192 Pss \u2212\n\u223c\n=\n\nT\nThis exact sequence ends at TorN\n1 (N T ss , P ) = 0 because P is projective. Since\nT\nTorN\n1 (N T ss , M ) = 0 by assumption, we conclude that Kss = 0. Hence another\napplication of the Nakayama Lemma shows that ker(f ) = 0 as well. Thus f is\ninvertible. This finishes the proof of the implication (3)=\u21d2(1), showing that the\nfirst three conditions are equivalent. Furthermore, our argument so far works for any\nsplit nilpotent extension of ZN for some N \u2208 N because this is the only information\nabout N T that we have used. Nilpotent extensions of the ring ZN always split\nbecause we can lift orthogonal idempotents in nilpotent extensions.\nFree N T -modules are exact, and they consist of free Abelian groups by (3.1).\nThis yields the implication (1)=\u21d2(4). We are going to prove that (4) implies (3).\nThis will finish the proof of the theorem. Since we will use this once again later,\nwe state half of this argument as a separate lemma:\nT\nLemma 3.13. Let M be an exact N T -module. Then TorN\n1 (N T ss , M ) = 0.\n\nProof. Let \u03c0 : P \u2192 M be an epimorphism with a projective N T -module P , and\nlet K := ker \u03c0. Since projective modules are exact and K \u058c P \u0589 M is a module\nextension, Proposition 3.6 shows that K is exact. We still have an exact sequence\nas in (3.5).\nSince K and P are exact, Lemma 3.8 identifies Kss (Y ) and Pss (Y ) in a natural\nway with subspaces of K(Z) and P (Z) for suitable Z; here we use A/ ker(f ) \u223c\n=\nrange(f ) for a group homomorphism f : A \u2192 B. Since the map K(Z) \u2192 P (Z)\nis injective, so is the map Kss (Y ) \u2192 Pss (Y ). Hence the map Kss \u2192 Pss is a\nT\nmonomorphism, forcing TorN\n\u0003\n1 (N T ss , M ) = 0 by (3.5).\nTo finish the proof of the implication (4)=\u21d2(3) in Theorem 3.12, it remains to\ncheck that Mss (Y ) is free for all Y if M is exact and M (Y ) is free for all Y . We\nuse Lemma 3.8 once again to describe Mss (Y ) as the range of a canonical element\nin N T \u2217 (Y, Z) for a suitable Z. Thus Mss (Y ) is isomorphic to a subgroup of M (Z),\nwhich is a free group by assumption. Hence Mss (Y ) is free as well.\n\u0003\n\n\f18\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\n4. Homological algebra in KK(X)\nLet X be a sober topological space. We are going to apply to KK(X) the general machinery for doing homological algebra in triangulated categories discussed\nin [9]. This theory goes back to the work on relative homological algebra by Samuel\nEilenberg and John Coleman Moore ([4]), which was carried over to the setting of\ntriangulated categories by Daniel Christensen [3] and Apostolos Beligiannis [1].\n4.1. An ideal in KK(X). Our starting point is a rough idea of the invariant we\nwant to use. This rough idea is expressed by a homological ideal in the triangulated\ncategory. The ideal I in KK(X) relevant for us is defined by\n\b\n(4.1) I(A, B) := f \u2208 KK(X; A, B)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nf\u2217 : K\u2217 A(Y ) \u2192 K\u2217 B(Y ) vanishes for all Y \u2208 LC(X) .\n\nIt makes no difference if we use LC(X) or LC(X)\u2217 here.\nWe claim that I is a homological ideal in the triangulated category KK(X); that\nis, it is the kernel (on morphisms) of a stable homological functor from KK(X)\nto some stable Abelian category; stability means that the functor intertwines the\nsuspension automorphism on KK(X) with a given suspension automorphism on the\ntarget Abelian category.\nOur starting point is a bare form of filtrated K-theory. Recall the functors\n\u0001\nFKY : KK(X) \u2192 AbZ/2 ,\nA 7\u2192 K\u2217 A(Y )\nfor Y \u2208 LC(X) from Definition 2.1 and let\nY\nAbZ/2 ,\nF := (FKY )Y \u2208LC(X) : KK(X) \u2192\nY \u2208LC(X)\u2217\n\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\nA 7\u2192 K\u2217 A(Y )\n\nY \u2208LC(X)\u2217\n\n.\n\nQ\nThe target category Y \u2208LC(X)\u2217 AbZ/2 of F is Abelian and carries an obvious suspension functor that shifts the Z/2-grading. The functor F is a stable homological\nfunctor, that is, it intertwines the suspension automorphisms and maps exact triangles to long exact sequences. By definition,\n\\\nker FKY = ker F,\n(4.2)\nI=\nY \u2208LC(X)\u2217\n\nthat is, f \u2208 I(A, B) if and only if F (f ) = 0. Hence I is a homological ideal with\ndefining functor F .\nWe also have I = ker FK with FK as in Definition 2.4: the two functors F\nand FK only differ through their target categories. For the time being, we pretend\nthat we do not yet know anything about filtrated K-theory beyond the ideal I it\ndefines. The general machinery will automatically lead us to the functor FK.\nAs explained in [9], the homological ideal I yields various notions of homological\nalgebra. The following descriptions of these notions follow from [9, Lemmas 3.2\nand 3.9, Definition 3.21].\n\u2022 A morphism f \u2208 KK\u2217 (X; A, B) is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2013 I-epic if the induced maps K\u2217 A(Y ) \u2192 K\u2217 B(Y ) are surjective for\nall Y \u2208 LC(X);\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2013 I-monic if the induced maps K\u2217 A(Y ) \u2192 K\u2217 B(Y ) are injective for\nall Y \u2208 LC(X);\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2013 an I-equivalence if the induced maps K\u2217 A(Y ) \u2192 K\u2217 B(Y ) are\nbijective for all Y \u2208 LC(X).\n\u2022 A homological functor F : KK(X) \u2192 C to some Abelian category C is\nI-exact if F (f ) = 0 for all f \u2208 I; equivalently, F maps I-epimorphisms\nto epimorphisms or F maps I-monomorphisms to monomorphisms.\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n19\n\n\u2022 An object A \u2208\u2208 KK(X) is\n\u0001\n\u2013 I-contractible if K\u2217 A(Y ) = 0 for all Y \u2208 LC(X);\n\u2013 I-projective if the functor KK\u2217 (X; A, ) is I-exact; equivalently, I(A, B) =\n0 for all B \u2208\u2208 KK(X), or: any I-epimorphism B \u2192 A splits (see [9]\nfor more equivalent characterisations).\n\u2022 A chain complex\n\u03b4n+1\n\n\u03b4n\u22121\n\n\u03b4\n\nn\nAn\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 An\u22122 \u2192 * * *\n* * * \u2192 An+1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 An \u2212\u2192\n\nin KK(X)-that is, An \u2208\u2208 KK(X) and \u03b4n \u2208 KK(X; An , An\u22121 ) for all n \u2208 Z,\nsubject to the condition \u03b4n\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4n = 0-is I-exact (in some degree n) if the\ninduced chain complexes of Z/2-graded Abelian groups\n\u0001\n\u0001 (\u03b4n )\u2217\n\u0001 (\u03b4n+1 )\u2217\n* * * \u2192 K\u2217 An+1 (Y ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 K\u2217 An (Y ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 K\u2217 An\u22121 (Y ) \u2192 * * *\n\nare exact (in degree n) for all Y \u2208 LC(X).\n\u2022 An I-projective resolution of A \u2208\u2208 KK(X) is an I-exact chain complex\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n0\n1\n2\nA \u2192 0 \u2192 ***\nP0 \u2212\u2192\nP1 \u2212\u2192\n* * * \u2192 P2 \u2212\u2192\n\nwith I-projective entries Pn for all n \u2208 N.\nWe shall soon see that there are enough I-projective objects in the sense that any\nobject of KK(X) has an I-projective resolution. Such resolutions are unique up to\nchain homotopy equivalence once they exist.\nWe use projective resolutions to define derived functors (see [9, Definition 3.27]):\njust apply the functor to be derived to an I-projective resolution and take homology.\nIn particular, this yields extension groups ExtnI (A, B) for all A, B \u2208\u2208 KK(X). Unlike in usual homological algebra, Ext0I (A, B) may differ from the morphism space\nin KK(X), compare the exact sequence (4.8) in [6].\n4.2. Enough projective objects. A strategy to find enough projective objects is\noutlined in [9, \u00a73.6]. The idea is to study the left adjoint functor FK\u22a2Y of FKY ; this\nis defined on P \u2208\u2208 AbZ/2 if there is FK\u22a2Y (P ) \u2208\u2208 KK(X) and a natural isomorphism\n\u0001\n(4.3)\nHom P, FKY (B) \u223c\n= KK(X; FK\u22a2 (P ), B)\nY\n\nFK\u22a2Y\n\nfor all B \u2208\u2208 KK(X). Notice that\nneed not be defined for all P .\nObjects of the form FK\u22a2Y (P ) are automatically I-projective because the functor\nKK(X; FK\u22a2Y (P ), ) factors through FKY by (4.3) and vanishes on I by (4.2).\nThe simplest case to look for FK\u22a2Y (P ) is P = Z[0] (this means Z in degree 0).\nThe defining property of FK\u22a2Y (Z[0]) is a natural isomorphism\n\u0001\n\u0001\nKK(X; FK\u22a2 (Z[0]), B) \u223c\n= Hom Z[0], FKY (B) \u223c\n= FKY,0 (B) = K0 B(Y ) .\nY\n\nIn other words, FK\u22a2Y (Z[0]) must represent the covariant functor FKY . Theorem 2.5\nprovides such representing objects, and yields the following:\n\nProposition 4.1. For any Y \u2208 LC(X), the adjoint functor FK\u22a2Y is defined on a\nZ/2-graded Abelian group G = G0 \u2295 G1 if G0 and G1 are free and countable. More\nprecisely,\n!\nM\nM\n\u22a2\nFKY\nZ[\u03b5i ] =\nRY [\u03b5i ],\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\nwhere I is a countable set and \u03b5i \u2208 Z/2 for all i \u2208 I.\n\nProof. We have just observed that FK\u22a2Y (Z[0]) = RY . Since FKY is stable, this\nimplies FK\u22a2Y (Z[1]) = RY [1]. It is a general feature of left adjoint functors that they\ncommute with direct sums. Since countable direct sums exist in KK(X), we get the\nexistence of FK\u22a2Y on any free countable Z/2-graded Abelian group.\n\u0003\n\n\f20\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nCorollary 4.2. There are enough I-projective objects in KK(X), and the class of\nI-projective objects in KK(X) is generated by the objects RY for Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 .\nMore precisely, any I-projective objects is a retract of a direct sum of suspensions\nof these objects.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 4.1 and [9, Proposition 3.37].\n\n\u0003\n\nOften we do not need retracts here, that is, any I-projective object is a direct\nsum of suspensions of RY for Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 ; for the totally ordered spaces studied\nin \u00a73, this follows from Theorem 3.12.\nSince our ideal I is compatible with countable direct sums, the I-contractible\nobjects form a localising subcategory of KK(X), that is, they form a class NI of\nobjects that is closed under countable direct sums, retracts, isomorphism, exact\ntriangles, and suspensions. Furthermore, NI is the complement of the localising\nsubcategory that is generated by the I-projective objects. These two subcategories\ncontain much less information than the ideal itself. Roughly speaking, they will be\nthe same for any reasonable choice of invariant on KK(X) of K-theoretic nature.\nProposition 4.3. The localising subcategory that is generated by the I-projective\nobjects is the bootstrap category B(X). It consists of all objects of KK(X) that are\nKK(X)-equivalent to a tight, nuclear, purely infinite, stable, separable C\u2217 -algebra\nover X whose simple subquotients belong to the bootstrap category B \u2286 KK.\nProof. By definition, B(X) is the localising subcategory of KK(X) that is generated\nby the objects ix (C) for x \u2208 X, see [8]. These generators are I-projective because\nthey represent the functors FKUx , compare the proof of the Representability Theorem 2.5. The proof of this theorem also shows that the representing objects RY\nbelong to the triangulated subcategory of KK(X) generated by RUx for x \u2208 X and\nhence to B(X). Now Corollary 4.2 shows that all I-projective objects belong to\nB(X). Hence the localising subcategory they generate is contained in the bootstrap\nclass.\nConversely, since the generators of the bootstrap class ix (C) are I-projective,\nthe localising subcategory generated by the I-projective objects must contain the\nwhole bootstrap class. This yields the first statement. The second one is contained\nin [8, Corollary 5.5].\n\u0003\n4.3. The universality of filtrated K-theory. The next step in the general programme is to determine the universal defining functor for I. This functor is characterised by the universal property that it is I-exact and stable homological and\nthat any I-exact homological functor on KK(X) factors through it uniquely (up to\nnatural isomorphism).\nThe advantage of using the universal functor is that it describes I-projective\nresolutions and the associated I-derived functors in KK(X) by projective resolutions\nand derived functors in its target Abelian category. This is the crucial step to\ncompute these derived functors.\nIn the presence of enough projective objects, [9, Theorem 3.39] characterises the\nuniversal functor by an adjointness property. In our case, this yields:\nTheorem 4.4. The filtrated K-theory functor FK : KK(X) \u2192 Mod(N T )c is the\nuniversal I-exact stable homological functor; here Mod(N T )c denotes the category\nof all countable graded N T -modules.\nThe ring of natural transformations N T comes in automatically at this point.\nProof. This is best explained as a special case of a general result on certain homological ideals. Let T be any triangulated category with countable direct sums, and\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n21\n\nlet G be an at most countable set of objects of T. Let IG be the stable homological\nideal defined by the functor\nY\n\u0001\nFG : T \u2192\nAbZ ,\nA 7\u2192 T\u2217 (G, A) G\u2208G .\nG\u2208G\n\nWe assume that FG (A) is countable for all A \u2208\u2208 T.\nWe are dealing with the case where T = KK(X) and G = {RY \u0001| Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 };\nTheorem 2.5 identifies T\u2217 (RY , A) = KK\u2217 (X; RY , A) \u223c\n= K\u2217 A(Y ) = FKY (A) for\nall Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 , so that IG = I with I as in (4.1).\nViewing G as a full subcategory of T, it becomes a Z-graded pre-additive category, so that we get a corresponding category Mod(Gop )c of countable graded right\nmodules. We can enrich the functor FG to a functor\nFG\u2032 : T \u2192 Mod(Gop )c\nbecause the composition in T provides maps\nT\u2217 (G\u2032 , A) \u2297 T\u2217 (G, G\u2032 ) \u2192 T\u2217 (G, A)\n\n\u0001\nfor all G, G\u2032 \u2208 G, A \u2208\u2208 T, which form a right G-module structure on T\u2217 (G, A) G\u2208G .\nWe claim that the functor FG\u2032 is the universal IG -exact functor.\nIn the case at hand, our description of the natural transformations FKY \u21d2 FKZ\nin \u00a72.1 means that Mod(Gop )c = Mod(N T )c and FG\u2032 = FK is filtrated K-theory\nas defined in Definition 2.4. Hence it suffices to establish the claim above to finish\nthe proof of Theorem 4.4.\nTo do this, we check the conditions in [9, Theorem 3.39]. Idempotent morphisms\nin KK(X) split because this happens in any triangulated category with countable\ndirect sums (see [10]). Call FG\u2032 (G) = T( , G) for G \u2208 G the free Gop -module\non G. Direct sums of free modules are projective, and any object of Mod(Gop )c is a\nquotient of a countable direct sum of free modules. Hence Mod(Gop )c has enough\nprojective objects. Moreover,\n\u0001\nHomGop F \u2032 (G), F \u2032 (A) \u223c\n= F \u2032 (A)(G) = T(G, A)\nG\n\nG\n\n\u22a2\n\nG\n\nFG\u2032\n\nshows that the left adjoint F of F :=\nmaps FG\u2032 (G) to G \u2208\u2208 T. Since the\n\u22a2\ndomain of F is closed under suspensions, countable direct sums, and retracts, the\nadjoint is defined on all projective modules. Furthermore, F \u25e6 F \u22a2 (P ) \u223c\n= P holds\nfor free modules and hence for all projective modules P . Having checked all the\nhypotheses of [9, Theorem 3.39], we can conclude that FG\u2032 is indeed universal. \u0003\n\nSince FK : KK(X) \u2192 Mod(N T )c is universal, [9, Theorem 3.41] now tells us,\nroughly speaking, that homological algebra in KK(X) with respect to I is equivalent\nto homological algebra in the Abelian category Mod(N T )c :\n\u2022 An object A of KK(X) is I-projective if and only if FK(A) \u2208 Mod(N T )c\nis projective and\n\u0001\nKK\u2217 (X; A, B) \u223c\n= HomN T FK(A), FK(B)\nfor all B \u2208\u2208 KK(X).\nAnother equivalent condition is that FK(A) \u2208 Mod(N T )c is projective\nand A belongs to the localising subcategory generated by the I-projective\nobjects; the latter agrees with the bootstrap class by Proposition 4.3.\n\u2022 The functor FK and its partially defined left adjoint FK\u22a2 restrict to an\nequivalence of categories between the subcategories of I-projective objects\nin KK(X) and of projective objects in Mod(N T )c .\n\u2022 For any A \u2208\u2208 KK(X), the functors FK and FK\u22a2 induce bijections between\nisomorphism classes of I-projective resolutions of A and isomorphism classes\n\n\f22\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nof projective resolutions of FK(A) in Mod(N T )c . That is, a projective resolution in Mod(N T )c lifts to a unique I-projective resolution in KK(X).\nThis provides the \"geometric resolutions\" that are used in connection with\nthe usual Universal Coefficient Theorem for KK.\n\u2022 For all n \u2208 N, there is a natural isomorphism\n\u0001\nExtn (A, B) \u223c\n= Extn FK(A), FK(B) ,\nI\n\nNT\n\nwhere the right hand side denotes extension groups in the Abelian category\nMod(N T )c .\n\u2022 For any homological functor G : KK(X) \u2192 C, there is a unique right-exact\nfunctor \u1e20 : Mod(N T )c \u2192 C with \u1e20 \u25e6 FK(P ) = G(P ) for all I-projective P .\nThe left derived functors of G with respect to I are Ln \u1e20 \u25e6 FK for n \u2208 N,\nwhere Ln \u1e20 : Mod(N T )c \u2192 C denotes the nth left derived functor of \u1e20.\n\n4.4. The Universal Coefficient Theorem. In the general theory, the next step\nis to construct a spectral sequence whose E 2 -term involves the extension groups\nExtnI (A[m], B); it converges-in favourable cases-to KK\u2217 (X; A, B). This spectral\nsequence is constructed in [3, 6]. Since we aim for an exact sequence, not for a\nspectral sequence, we only need the special case considered in [9, Theorem 4.4].\nThis provides the Universal Coefficient Theorem we want under the assumption\nthat FK(A) has a projective resolution of length 1 in Mod(N T )c :\nTheorem 4.5. Let A, B \u2208\u2208 KK(X). Suppose that FK(A) \u2208\u2208 Mod(N T )c has a\nprojective resolution of length 1 and that A \u2208\u2208 B(X). Then there are natural short\nexact sequences\n\u0001\n\u0001\nExt1N T FK(A)[j + 1], FK(B) \u058c KKj (X; A, B) \u0589 HomN T FK(A)[j], FK(B)\nfor j \u2208 Z/2, where HomN T and Ext1N T denote the morphism and extension groups\nin the Abelian category Mod(N T )c and [j] and [j + 1] denote degree shifts.\n\nThe bootstrap class appears here because of Proposition 4.3, which identifies it\nwith the localising subcategory generated by the I-projective objects.\nCorollary 4.6. Let A, B \u2208\u2208 B(X) and suppose that both FK(A) and FK(B) have\nprojective resolutions of length 1 in Mod(N T )c . Then any morphism FK(A) \u2192\nFK(B) in Mod(N T )c lifts to an element in KK0 (X; A, B), and an isomorphism\nFK(A) \u223c\n= FK(B) lifts to an isomorphism in B(X).\nProof. The lifting of a homomorphism follows from Theorem 4.5. Given an isomorphism f : FK(A) \u2192 FK(B), we can lift f and f \u22121 to elements \u03b1 and \u03b2 of\nKK0 (X; A, B) and KK0 (X; B, A), respectively. Since \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 lifts the identity\n\u0001 map\non FK(A), the difference id \u2212 \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 belongs to Ext1N T FK(A)[j + 1], FK(A) . The\nlatter is a nilpotent ideal in KK(X; A, A) because of the naturality of the exact\nsequence in Theorem 4.5. Hence (id \u2212 \u03b2\u03b1)2 = 0, so that \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 is invertible. The\nsame argument shows that \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2 is invertible, so that \u03b1 is invertible.\n\u0003\nThis corollary is what is needed for the classification programme, and it depends\non resolutions having length 1. Conversely, if there is A for which FK(A) has no\nprojective resolution of length 1, then it is likely that there exist non-isomorphic\nB, D \u2208\u2208 B(X) with FK(B) \u223c\n= FK(D). The following theorem provides such a\ncounterexample, but under a stronger assumption.\nTheorem 4.7. Let I be a homological ideal in a triangulated category T with enough\nI-projective objects. Let F : T \u2192 AI T be a universal I-exact stable homological\nfunctor. Suppose that I2 6= 0. Then there exist non-isomorphic objects B, D \u2208\u2208 T\nfor which F (B) \u223c\n= F (D) in AI T.\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n23\n\nProof. Since I2 6= 0, there is A \u2208\u2208 T with I2 (A, ) 6= 0, that is, A is not\nI2 -projective. The ideal I2 has enough projective objects as well, so that there\nis an exact triangle\n\u03b32\n\u03b92\n\u03b12\nN2\nA \u2212\u2192\n\u03a3N2 \u2212\u2192 \u00c32 \u2212\u2192\nwith \u03b92 \u2208 I2 and an I2 -projective object \u00c32 (this is part of the phantom castle\nconstructed in [6], where the same notation is used).\nSince \u03b92 \u2208 I, this triangle is I-exact and hence provides an extension\nF (N2 )[1] \u058c F (\u00c32 ) \u0589 F (A)\nin AI T. Even more, this extension splits because \u03b92 \u2208 I2 . This follows because the\ncanonical map\nI(A, N2 ) \u2192 Ext1I (A, N2 [1])\nimplicitly used above factors through I/I2 and hence annihilates \u03b92 (see [6, Equation (4.9)]). As a result, F (\u00c32 ) \u223c\n= F (A) \u2295 F (N2 )[1].\nBut \u00c32 cannot be isomorphic to A \u2295 N2 [1]. If this were the case, then A would\nbe I2 -projective, as a retract of the I2 -projective object \u00c32 . Then I2 (A, ) = 0,\ncontradicting our choice of A. Hence \u00c32 6\u223c\n\u0003\n= A \u2295 N2 [1].\nIf I2 = 0, then the ABC spectral sequence constructed in [6] degenerates at the\nthird stage, that is, E 3 = E \u221e . But E 2 and E 3 differ unless projective resolutions\nhave length 1. Hence the vanishing of I2 is probably not sufficient for isomorphisms\non the invariant to lift because the boundary map d2 on the second stage of the\nABC spectral sequence may provide further obstructions.\nWhether or not filtrated K-theory gives rise to projective resolutions of length 1\ndepends on the space in question: we will find positive and negative cases below.\nBefore we turn to examples, we discuss another important issue: does filtrated\nK-theory exhaust all of Mod(N T )c ? This is definitely not the case because of\nthe additional exactness conditions that hold for objects of the form FK(A). The\nfollowing result is not optimal but sufficient for our purposes.\nTheorem 4.8. Let G \u2208\u2208 Mod(N T )c have a projective resolution of length 1. Then\nthere is A \u2208\u2208 B(X) with FK(A) \u223c\n= G, and this object is unique up to isomorphism\nin B(X).\nProof. Any projective resolution of length 1 in Mod(N T )c is isomorphic to one of\nthe form\nFK(f )\n* * * \u2192 0 \u2192 FK(P1 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 FK(P0 ) \u2192 G\nfor suitable I-projective objects P1 , P0 \u2208\u2208 KK(X) and some f \u2208 KK0 (X; P1 , P0 ).\nHere we use that FK restricts to an equivalence of categories between the subcategories of I-projective objects of KK(X) and of projective objects of Mod(N T )c by\nthe first paragraph of [9, Theorem 3.41].\nWe may embed the morphism f in an exact triangle\nh\n\nf\n\ng\n\n\u2192 A.\n\u2192 P0 \u2212\n\u03a3A \u2212\n\u2192 P1 \u2212\nSince FK(f ) is injective, the map f is I-monic; thus g is I-epic and h \u2208 I. Therefore,\nthe long exact sequence for FK applied to the above triangle degenerates to a short\nexact sequence\nFK(P1 ) \u058c FK(P0 ) \u0589 FK(A).\nG\nas\ndesired. The uniqueness of A is already contained in\nThis yields FK(A) \u223c\n=\nCorollary 4.6.\n\u0003\nIt remains to understand which objects of the category Mod(N T )c have a projective resolution of length 1.\n\n\f24\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\n4.5. Resolutions of length 1 in the totally ordered case. We return to the\nexample of the space X = {1, . . . , n} totally ordered by \u2264 studied in \u00a73. Let N T be\nthe graded pre-additive category of natural transformations described in \u00a73, and let\nC = Mod(N T )c be the Abelian category of N T -modules. The following theorem\ncharacterises N T -modules with projective resolutions of length 1:\nTheorem 4.9. Let M \u2208\u2208 C. The following assertions are equivalent:\n(i) M = FK\u2217 (A) for some A \u2208\u2208 KK(X);\n(ii) M is exact in the sense of Definition 3.5;\nT\n(iii) TorN\n(N T ss , M ) = 0 for i = 1, 2;\ni\n(iv) M has a free resolution of length 1 in C;\n(v) M has a projective resolution of length 1 in C;\n(vi) M has a projective resolution of finite length in C.\nProof. The exact sequence (1.4) shows that (i) implies (ii). Theorem 4.8 contains\nthe implication (v)=\u21d2(i), and the implications (iv)=\u21d2(v)=\u21d2(vi) are trivial. We\nwill show (ii)=\u21d2(iii)=\u21d2(iv) and (vi)=\u21d2(ii), and this will establish the theorem.\nFirst we show that (vi) implies (ii). Let 0 \u2192 Pm \u2192 * * * \u2192 P0 \u2192 M be a\nprojective resolution of finite length. By a standard \"stabilisation\" trick, we can\nturn this into a free resolution of the same length. Let\nZj = ker(Pj \u2192 Pj\u22121 ) \u223c\n= range(Pj+1 \u2192 Pj ).\n\u223c M , and we have exact sequences Zj \u058c Pj \u0589 Zj\u22121\nThus Zm = 0, P0 /Z0 =\nbecause our chain complex is exact. Since Zm = 0, the exactness of the projective\nmodules Pm and Proposition 3.6 show recursively that Zj is exact for j = m \u2212\n1, m \u2212 2, . . . , 0, so that M is exact. Thus (vi) implies (ii).\nNow we prove (ii)=\u21d2(iii)=\u21d2(iv). Let P be a countable free module for which\nthere is an epimorphism \u03c0 : P \u0589 M , and let K := ker \u03c0. We have an extension\nof N T -modules K \u058c P \u0589 M . Proposition 3.6 shows that K is exact because P\nand M are exact. Furthermore, Tori+1 (N T ss , M ) \u223c\n= Tori (N T ss , K) for all i \u2265 1\nbecause P is projective. Lemma 3.13 applied to M and K yields Tori (N T ss , M ) = 0\nfor i = 1, 2 if M is exact, that is, (ii)=\u21d2(iii). Now assume (iii). The argument above\nyields Tor1 (N T ss , K) = 0. Since P is projective, the Abelian groups P (Y ) are free\nfor all Y \u2208 LC(X). The exact sequence in (3.5) yields the same for K(Y ). The\ncriterion in Theorem 3.12.(3) shows that K is projective.\n\u0003\nNow we combine the existence of projective resolutions of length 1 with Theorem 4.5, which still required this as a hypothesis:\nTheorem 4.10. Let X be the topological space associated to a totally ordered finite\nset, and let A and B be C\u2217 -algebras over X.

Then an isomorphism FK(A) \u223c\n= FK(B) lifts to an X-equivariant \u2217 -isomorphism A \u223c\n= B.\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n25\n\nFurthermore, any countable exact N T -modules is the filtrated K-module of some\ntight, purely infinite, stable, nuclear, separable C\u2217 -algebra over X with simple subquotients in the bootstrap category.\nProof. A nuclear C\u2217 -algebras over X belongs to the bootstrap category B(X) if and\nonly if its fibres belong to the non-equivariant bootstrap category B (see [8, Corollary 4.13]). For a tight C\u2217 -algebra over X, these fibres are the same as the simple\nsubquotients. It is also shown in [8, Corollary 5.5] that any object of B(X) is\nKK(X)-equivalent to a tight, nuclear, purely infinite, simple, separable C\u2217 -algebra\nover X whose simple subquotients belong to the bootstrap category B. A deep classification result of Eberhard Kirchberg shows that any KK(X)-equivalence between\nsuch objects lifts to an X-equivariant \u2217 -homomorphism. Now the first assertion follows from Theorem 4.10. The second assertion also uses Theorem 4.8.\n\u0003\n5.

First, there is a non-projective exact module M with free Mss ; secondly,\nthere is a module that has no projective resolution of length 1; thirdly, there are\nA, B \u2208 B(X) with I2 (A, B) 6= 0. Hence Theorem 4.7 provides non-isomorphic\nobjects in the bootstrap class B(X) with isomorphic filtrated K-theory. The construction of these counterexamples follows the above pattern: first we find a counterexample to Theorem 3.12, which we use to find one for Theorem 4.9, which is then\nused to find an example as in Theorem 4.7.\nWe begin with the unexpected non-projective module. Let PY for Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217\ndenote the free N T -module on Y , that is,\n\u223c N (Y )\nPY (Z) = N T \u2217 (Y, Z),\nHomN T (PY , N ) =\n\n\f28\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nfor any Y, Z \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 and any N T -module N . A natural transformation FKY \u21d2\nFKZ corresponds to an element in N T \u2217 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= PY (Z) \u223c\n= HomN T (Pz , PY ) and\nthus induces a module homomorphism PZ \u2192 PY in the opposite direction. Hence\nthe three arrows 124, 134, 234 \u2192 1234 in (5.1) induce a module homomorphism\nj : P1234 \u2192 P 0 := P124 \u2295 P134 \u2295 P234 .\nTable 1 shows that there are no module homomorphisms P 0 \u2192 P1234 , that is, no\nnon-zero natural transformations from 1234 to 124, 134, or 234.\nThe crucial observation is that j is a monomorphism, so that P1234 becomes a\nsubmodule of P 0 . Since the longest natural transformations out of 1234 are those\nto 14, 24 and 34, this follows from the elementary observations that the maps\nN T \u2217 (1234, j4) \u2192 N T \u2217 (1234 \\ j, j4)\nfor j = 1, 2, 3 are, respectively, the identity map on Z. This follows from the\nexactness of free modules because N T \u2217 (j, j4) = 0 by Table 1.\nWe describe the quotient\nM := P 0 /j(P1234 )\nby its values M (Y ) for Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 as in (5.1):\ni\n\n(5.2)\n\n/Z\n;0\u2749\n\u2707\u2707 \u2749\u2749\u2749 333=\n\u2707\n\u2707\ni\u27493\ni\u2707\n3\u2749i\n\u2707\u2707\n33 \u2749\u2749\u2749\n\u2707\u2707 i\n3\n!\n/03\nZ[1]\n\u2749\u2749\n=Z\n\u25cf\u25cf\n3\n\u2749\u2749 33\n\u25cf\u25cfi\ni\u27493\ni\n\u25cf\u25cf\n33\u2749\u2749\u2749\n\u25cf\u25cf\n3\n\u25cf# 33 i \u2749!\n/Z\n0\n\n< Z \u25cf\u25cf\n\u274b\u274b\n\u274b\u274b\n11 \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n1\nr 1\n\u274b\u274bi\n\u25cf\u03b4\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25e6\u25cf\n\u274b\u274b\n11\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\u274b\"\n11\n1\ni\nr\n\u03b4\n/ Z2\n/Z\n\u25e6\nZ[1]\n< \u274b\u274b\n\u2707\u2707\n\u274b\u274b\n11\n\u2707\n\u2707\ni 111\n\u03b4 \u2707\u2707\n\u274b\u274br\n\u2707\n\u274b\u274b\n1\n\u25e6\u2707\n\u274b\u274b \u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\n11\n1\n\u2707\n\" \u2707\n1\nZ\n\nThe boundary maps \u03b4 act by isomorphisms on M because M (j4) = 0 for j =\n1, 2, 3. The other maps can be understood by writing M (1234) = Z3 /h(1, 1, 1)i and\nM (j) = Z2 /h(1, 1)i for j = 1, 2, 3 as quotients. The three maps Z \u2192 Z2 correspond\nto the three coordinate embeddings Z \u058c Z3 , the maps Z2 \u2192 Z to the projections\nZ3 \u0589 Z2 onto coordinate hyperplanes.\nThe projective resolution\nj\n\n\u2192 P0 \u0589 M\n0 \u2192 P1234 \u2212\n\n(5.3)\n\ndoes not split because there exist no non-zero morphisms P 0 \u2192 P1234 . Hence M\nis not projective. But Mss is free, and M is exact because the exact modules form\nan exact category and P1234 and P 0 are exact. Thus M is a counterexample to\nTheorem 3.12.\nThe module M is directly related to the problem with describing N T nil *M (1234)\nencountered above. Since HomN T (PY , N ) \u223c\n= N (Y ) for any N T -module N and any\nY \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 , the resolution (5.3) provides an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 HomN T (M, N )\n\u2192 N (124) \u2295 N (134) \u2295 N (234) \u2192 N (1234) \u2192 Ext1N T (M, N ) \u2192 0,\nso that\n\nExt1N T (M, N ) \u223c\n= Nss (1234).\n= N (1234)/N T nil * N (1234) \u223c\nNow we use M to construct a counterexample for Theorem 4.9. Let k \u2208 N\u22652\nand let Mk := M/k * M ; that is, we replace Z by Z/k everywhere in (5.2). This\nmodule has a projective resolution of length 2 of the form\n(5.4)\n\n(\u2212k,j)\n\n(j,k)\n\n0 \u2192 P1234 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P1234 \u2295 P 0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P 0 \u0589 Mk ,\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n29\n\nwhere k denotes multiplication by k. Using this resolution, we compute\nExt2 (Mk , P1234 ) \u223c\n= Z/k,\n\nExt1 (Mk , P1234 ) \u223c\n= Hom(Mk , P1234 ) \u223c\n=0\n\nbecause there are no no-zero morphisms P 0 \u2192 P1234 . Of course, the generator of\nExt2 (Mk , P1234 ) is the class of the projective resolution (5.4). Hence Mk admits no\nprojective resolution of length 1 and is a counterexample to Theorem 4.9.\nNow we claim that Mk is the filtrated K-theory of some C\u2217 -algebra Ak over X in\nthe bootstrap class B(X). To begin with, M is the filtrated K-theory of some such\nC\u2217 -algebra A by Theorem 4.8. Let Bk be a C\u2217 -algebra in the bootstrap class with\nK0 (Bk ) = Z/k and K1 (Bk ) = 0; for instance, Bk could be the Cuntz algebra Ok+1 .\nThen Ak := A \u2297 Bk has filtrated K-theory Mk by the K\u00fcnneth Theorem for the\nK-theory of tensor products.\nTheorem 5.1. Let Ak be a C\u2217 -algebra in the bootstrap class with FK(Ak ) \u223c\n= Mk\nas constructed above. Then Ak is not I2 -projective. Hence there exist B, D \u2208 B(X)\nthat are not KK(X)-equivalent but with the same filtrated K-theory.\nProof. The second assertion follows from the first one using Theorem 4.7 applied\nto the bootstrap class B(X) and the restriction of I to B(X).\nIt remains to prove that Ak cannot be I2 -projective.

This implies N2 \u223c\n= P2 .\nThe composite map \u03b920 : Ak = N0 \u2192 N2 \u223c\n= P2 belongs to I2 . Suppose that Ak\nwere I2 -projective. Then \u03b920 = \u03b921 \u25e6 \u03b910 would vanish, and the long exact homology\nsequence would yield that the map \u03b921 : N1 \u2192 N2 must factor through the map\nN1 \u2192 P0 . But\n\u0001\nKK\u2217 (X; P0 , P2 ) \u223c\n= HomN T FK(P0 ), FK(P2 ) = HomN T (P 0 , P1234 ) = 0.\nHere we have used that filtrated K-theory, by universality, is fully faithful on\nI-projective objects and that there are no non-zero module homomorphisms P 0 \u2192\nP1234 . Since \u03b921 factors through the zero group, it must be the zero map. But then\nthe map P1 \u2192 N1 must be a split surjection, so that N1 is I-projective. Then the\nI-exact triangle \u03a3Ak \u2192 \u03a3N1 \u2192 P0 \u2192 Ak provides an I-projective resolution of Ak\nof length 1, which is impossible because FK(Ak ) \u223c\n= Mk has no projective resolution\nof length 1. As a consequence, Ak is not I2 -projective.\n\u0003\n\nWe can make the two non-equivalent C\u2217 -algebras over X with the same filtrated\nK-theory more explicit. One of them is Ak \u2295 \u03a3R1234 , the other one is the mapping\ncone of the map \u03b920 : Ak = N0 \u2192 N2 \u223c\n= R1234 in the phantom tower above. Both\nhave Mk \u2295 P1234 [1] as their filtrated K-theory.\nThis counterexample shows that filtrated K-theory does not yet classify purely\ninfinite stable nuclear separable C\u2217 -algebras in the bootstrap class.\n\n\f30\n\nRALF MEYER AND RYSZARD NEST\n\nRemark 5.2. Refining filtrated K-theory by taking filtrated K-theory with coefficients does not help. This gets rid of the counterexample Ak constructed above,\nbut other objects of B(X) without projective resolution of length 1 remain. An example is A \u2297 B, where B is a C\u2217 -algebra in the bootstrap class with K\u2217 (B) = Q[0]\nsuch as an appropriate UHF-algebra. Its filtrated K-theory is M \u2297 Q. This also\nhas cohomological dimension 2, and this is not affected much by taking K-theory\nwith coefficients because M \u2297 Q is torsion-free.\n5.1. A refined invariant. There are at least two ways to identify the source of\nthe problem for the space X. The first point of view is that what is missing is an\nexact sequence that has the generator \u03b1 of N T 1 (234, 14) as its connecting map.\nThe map \u03b1 corresponds to a map \u03a3R14 \u2192 R234 between the representing objects,\nwhich we also denote by \u03b1. In the triangulated category KK(X), we can embed the\nlatter map in an exact triangle\n(5.5)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2192 R234 \u2192 R12344 \u2192 R14 .\n\u03a3R14 \u2212\n\nThe notation R12344 will be explained later. The functors these objects represent\nsit in a long exact sequence\n(5.6)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2192 FK14 [1] \u2192 * * *\n* * * \u2192 FK14 \u2192 FK12344 \u2192 FK234 \u2212\n\nwhich is precisely what we want. The second point of view is that the troublemaker\nis the non-projective module M . Since M has a projective resolution of length 1,\nthere is a unique object in the bootstrap class with filtrated K-theory M . Actually,\nthis yields the same object as the first point of view:\nLemma 5.3. The non-projective module M above agrees with FK(R12344 ).\nProof. The map FKY (\u03b1) vanishes for almost all Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 simply because the\ngraded groups involved have different parity or one of them vanishes. The only\nexception is Y = 14. The group FK14 (R14 ) = N T (14, 14) is generated by the\nidentity natural transformation. Since \u03b1 is the generator of N T 1 (234, 14), the map\nFK14 (\u03b1) is invertible.\nNow we apply FK to the long exact sequence for the given exact triangle. Since\nFK(\u03b1) vanishes on most Y and is invertible for Y = 14, we can easily compute the\ngroups FKY (R12344 ). We get the same groups as for the module M . It remains to\ncheck that the isomorphism can be chosen as an N T -module homomorphism. The\nmain step is to check that the map\nZ2 \u223c\n= FK124 (R12344 ) \u2295 FK134 (R12344 ) \u2192 FK1234 (R12344 ) \u223c\n= Z2\nis invertible. Together with the known relations between the various natural transformations, this implies the assertion. We omit the details of this computation. \u0003\nThe representing object R12344 is an algebra of functions on a two-dimensional\nsimplicial complex, which we do not describe here because it is not illuminating.\nThe functor that it represents, however, can be described rather nicely as follows.\nLet A be a C\u2217 -algebra over X. Pull back the extension A(14) \u058c A(124) \u0589 A(2)\nalong the quotient map A(234) \u0589 A(2) to an extension A(14) \u058c A(12344) \u0589\nA(234). The object R12344 represents the functor\n\u0001\n(5.7)\nKK\u2217 (X; R12344 , A) \u223c\n= K\u2217 A(12344) .\n\u0001\nTo see this, two observations are necessary. First, K\u2217 R12344 (12344) \u223c\n= Z; the\ngenerator of this group yields a natural transformation between the two functors\nin (5.7). Secondly, this natural transformation is invertible. This follows from the\nFive Lemma, once we know that it extends the known natural isomorphisms\n\u0001\n\u223c K\u2217 A(Y )\nKK\u2217 (X; RY , A) =\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n31\n\nfor Y = 14 and Y = 234 to a chain map between the long exact sequences that\nwe get from (5.5) and from the extension A(14) \u058c A(12344) \u0589 A(234). This\nextension also explains the notation R12344 .\nNow we augment filtrated K-theory by adding the covariant functor\n\u0001\n\u223c KK\u2217 (X; R12344 , B).\nB 7\u2192 FK12344 (B) := K\u2217 A(12344) =\n\nThe new invariant takes values in the category of countable N T \u2032 -modules, where\nN T \u2032 is the Z/2-graded category whose object set is LC\u2032 := LC(X)\u2217 \u2294 {12344} and\nwhose morphisms are the natural transformations between the various filtrated\nK-groups, including now also FK12344 . These natural transformations can be computed by the Yoneda Lemma:\nN T \u2032 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= KK\u2217 (X; RZ , RY ) \u223c\n= FKZ (RY )\n\u2217\n\n\u2032\n\nholds for all Y, Z \u2208 LC . The category ring for N T \u2032\u2217 is simply the ring KK\u2217 (X; R, R)\nwhere\nM\nRY .\nR :=\nY \u2208LC\u2032\n\nWe replace the ideal I in KK(X) studied above by the kernel I\u2032 of the enriched\nfiltrated K-theory functor\nFK\u2032 : KK(X) \u2192 Mod(N T \u2032 )c .\n\nThe same arguments as above show that there are enough I\u2032 -projective objects and\nthat FK\u2032 is the universal I\u2032 -exact stable homological functor.\nThe passage from I to I\u2032 has improved the situation because R12344 has now\nbeen promoted to an I\u2032 -projective object and, therefore, ceases to cause trouble.\nIn principle, something similar can be done in great generality: whenever we have\nan object of the Abelian approximation that has a projective resolution of length 1,\nwe can lift it uniquely to an object of the triangulated category and refine the\nideal by intersecting it with the kernel of the functor this lifted object represents.\nHowever, the policy to quieten troublemakers by promotion has the tendency to\nencourage new troublemakers, so that it is not clear whether this general strategy\nalways resolves all problems after finitely many steps. But in the relatively simple\nexample at hand, this turns out to be the case.\nTo check this, we must describe the category N T \u2032 . If Y, Z \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 , then\nN T \u2032\u2217 (Y, Z) = N T \u2217 (Y, Z) is given by the table on page 26. Furthermore, if Z \u2208\nLC(X)\u2217 , then N T \u2032\u2217 (12344, Z) \u223c\n= FKZ (R12344 ) = M (Z) by Lemma 5.3, and this is\ndescribed in (5.2). The upshot is:\n\u2022 there are even natural transformations from FK12344 to FK124 , FK134 ,\nFK234 -the generators of the respective groups of natural transformations-\nsuch that any natural transformation FK12344 \u21d2 FKZ with Z \u2208 LC(X)\u2217\nis a sum of natural transformations that factor through one of these three\nand a natural transformation FKij4 \u21d2 FKZ ;\n\u2022 the sum of the three natural transformations FK12344 \u21d2 FK1234 via FK124 ,\nFK134 and FK234 vanishes, and all other relations follow from these and\nthe already known ones listed after (5.1).\nThe exact triangle (5.5) yields a long exact sequence\n\u03b1\n\n* * * \u2192 N T \u2032\u2217+1 (Y, 234) \u2212\n\u2192 N T \u2032\u2217 (Y, 14) \u2192 N T \u2032\u2217 (Y, 12344) \u2192 N T \u2032\u2217 (Y, 234) \u2192 * * * ,\nwhich we may use to compute N T \u2032\u2217 (Y, 12344) for all Y \u2208 LC\u2032 . The map \u03b1 induces\nan isomorphism for Y = 234 and the zero map for all other Y because the source\nand target have opposite parity or one of them vanishes.

Inspecting composition with natural transformations in N T , we arrive at the following:\n\u2022 there are even natural transformations FKj4 \u21d2 FK12344 for j = 1, 2, 3, such\nthat any natural transformation FKY \u21d2 FK12344 with Y \u2208 LC(X)\u2217 factors\nthrough one of them;\n\u2022 the sum of the three natural transformations FK4 \u21d2 FK12344 vanishes,\n\u2022 the natural transformations FKj4 \u21d2 FK1234\\j via FK12344 vanish;\n\u2022 all other relations follow from these and the already known ones.\nAs one may expect, the basic natural transformations FK14 \u21d2 FK12344 \u21d2 FK234\nare induced by the maps R234 \u2192 R12344 \u2192 R14 in the exact triangle (5.5).\nThe indecomposable morphisms of the new category N T \u2032 are the maps in the\nfollowing diagram:\n=1\u2743\n? 14 \u274b\u274b\n;124\u274b\u274b\n33 \u2743\u2743\u2743\n\u2708\u2708\n\u274b\u274b\n\u274b\u274b\n77\n\u2708\n3\n7\n\u2708\n3\n\u274b\n\u274b\n7\n\u2708\n\u25e6\u2743\u2743\n\u274b\u274b\n\u274b\u274b\n33\n\u2708\u2708\n77\n\u2743\u2743\n\u274b#\n\u274b#\n33\n\u2708\u2708\n\u001e\n77\n/\n/\n/4\n/\n/\n/\n\u25e6\n2\n4\u2745\n24\n12344\n1234\n134\n@\n; \u2749\u2749\n; \u274d\u274d\n1\n1\n\u2745\u2745\n\u274d\u274d\n\u2749\u2749\n1\n11\n1\n\u2745\u2745\n\u274d\n1\n\u2749\n1\n\u274d\u274d\n1\n\u25e6\n\u2749\u2749\n\u2745\u2745\n11\n\u274d\u274d\n11\n\u2749\u2749\n\u001f\n11\n#\n11\n!\n3\n234\n34\nThe category ring of N T \u2032 again has the by now familiar structure: it is a split\n\u2032\nnilpotent extension of the semisimple algebra N T \u2032ss \u223c\n= ZLC spanned by the identity\ntransformations on the objects and a nilpotent ideal N T \u2032nil that is the subgroup\ngenerated by N T \u2032 (Y, Z) with Y 6= Z.\nDefinition 5.4. A module over N T \u2032 is exact if it is exact as an N T -module and\nthe three sequences\n* * * \u2192 N\u2217+1 (ij4) \u2192 N\u2217 (k4) \u2192 N\u2217 (12344) \u2192 N\u2217 (ij4) \u2192 * * *\nfor {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} are exact as well.\nThe range of the invariant FK\u2032 consists of exact N T \u2032 -modules; the three new\nexact sequences are, in fact, equivalent for symmetry reasons, and the extension\n* * * \u2192 N\u2217+1 (234) \u2192 N\u2217 (14) \u2192 N\u2217 (12344) \u2192 N\u2217 (234) \u2192 * * *\nis built into the definition of FK12344 .\nLet N be an exact N T \u2032 -module and let N \u2032 := N T \u2032nil * N . The description of\n\u2032\nN (14), N \u2032 (1), and N \u2032 (4) is the same as for the category N T , so that these groups\nremain kernels of certain maps, as needed. Furthermore, N \u2032 (1234) is the kernel of\nthe map N (1234) \u2192 N (12344)[1] induced by the generator of N T 1 (1234, 12344),\nso that the problem that appeared for the category N T is cured.\nThe computation of N \u2032 (124) changes because this group is now the range of the\narrow N (12344) \u2192 N (124). But this is part of a long exact sequence because N is\nexact, and we get\n\u0001\nN \u2032 (124) = ker N (124) \u2192 N (34)[1] ,\n\nand similarly for N \u2032 (134) and N \u2032 (234).\nFinally, N \u2032 (12344) is the sum of the ranges of the maps N (j4) \u2192 N (12344) for\nj = 1, 2, 3. Using exactness, we identify this in two steps with the kernel of the\nmap N (12344) \u2192 N (4)[1] induced by the generator of N T \u20321 (12344, 4).\nAs a result, the submodule N T \u2032nil * N is described using kernels of maps N (Y ) \u2192\nN (Z). By the way, these arrows are the longest arrows starting at Y as in Remark 3.9. The same arguments as for totally ordered spaces now show:\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OVER TOPOLOGICAL SPACES: FILTRATED K-THEORY\n\n33\n\nTheorem 5.5. An N T \u2032 -module N is free if and only if it is projective, if and only\nif it is exact and N (Y ) is a free group for all Y \u2208 LC\u2032 .\nTheorem 5.6. An N T \u2032 -module N has a projective resolution of length 1 if and\nonly if it is exact.\nTheorem 5.7. Let A and B be C\u2217 -algebras over the four-point space X under\nconsideration. If A belongs to the bootstrap class B(X), then there is a natural\nshort exact sequence\n\u0001\n\u0001\nExt1N T \u2032 FK\u2032 (A)[1], FK\u2032 (B) \u058c KK\u2217 (X; A, B) \u0589 HomN T \u2032 FK\u2032 (A), FK\u2032 (B) .\n\nIn particular, morphisms FK\u2032 (A) \u2192 FK\u2032 (B) lift to elements in KK\u2217 (X; A, B). If\nboth A and B belong to the bootstrap class, then an isomorphism FK\u2032 (A) \u223c\n= FK\u2032 (B)\nlifts to a KK(X)-equivalence.\nCorollary 5.8. The map A 7\u2192 FK\u2032 (A) is a bijection between the set of isomorphism\nclasses of tight, stable, purely infinite, separable, nuclear C\u2217 -algebras over X with\nsimple subquotients in the bootstrap class and the set of isomorphism classes of\ncountable exact N T \u2032 -modules.\n6. Conclusion\nWe have obtained a Universal Coefficient Theorem that computes KK\u2217 (X; A, B)\nfor A in the bootstrap class and X of a very special form, namely, {1, . . . , n} with\nthe Alexandrov topology from the total order. This Universal Coefficient Theorem\ncan be used to carry over classification results for simple, nuclear, purely infinite\nC\u2217 -algebras to nuclear, purely infinite C\u2217 -algebras with primitive ideal space X,\nusing filtrated K-theory as the invariant.\nFor general finite topological spaces X, we still get a spectral sequence that\ncomputes KK\u2217 (X; A, B) using filtrated K-theory, but this spectral sequence need\nnot degenerate to an exact sequence, so that isomorphisms on filtrated K-theory\nneed not lift to X-equivariant KK-equivalences. In fact, we have found a counterexample. At the same time, we were able to fix the counterexample by refining\nfiltrated K-theory. It is unclear whether such a refinement is available for all finite\ntopological spaces and how it looks like.\nReferences\n[1] Apostolos Beligiannis, Relative homological algebra and purity in triangulated categories, J.\nAlgebra 227 (2000), no. 1, 268\u2013361, doi: 10.1006/jabr.1999.8237.
