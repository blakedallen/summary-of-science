Introduction\nThe abelian category P = P(X, S) of perverse sheaves on a space X, constructible with\nrespect to a stratification S, was introduced in [1] and has a raft of applications, especially\nin representation theory. A standard complaint about perverse sheaves is that they are not\nvery concrete: P is defined as a subcategory of the derived category of sheaves on X, but\nmany of its basic properties are not obvious from this definition. Moreover when one wishes\nto work with a particular perverse sheaf it is not very efficient, if it is even possible, to write\nit down as a chain complex.\nA lot of work has been done to address this complaint. One approach has been to develop\nmethods to describe P(X, S) more explicitly, both in general (e.g. [10], [8]) and for especially\ninteresting pairs (X, S) (e.g. [4], [3]). Another approach (e.g. [11], [5]) has been to try to\nunderstand more abstractly \"what kind\" of category P(X, S) is \u2013 for instance (especially\nin [5]) by formulating the useful properties of perverse sheaves as axioms rather than as\nconsequences of an opaque definition. This paper is a contribution to this circle of ideas.\nOur starting point is the fact (proved already in [1]) that P(X, S) is the category of global\nobjects of a stack of categories P on X \u2013 this means roughly that a perverse sheaf on X may\nbe given by a perverse sheaf on each chart of an open cover, together with descent data. We\nare interested in \"what kind\" of stack P is, rather than \"what kind\" of category P is.\nIn this paper, we introduce a class of stacks we call \"stacks of type P.\" The stacks of\ntype P include the stack of perverse sheaves (of any perversity), and they are singled out\nby a list of fairly innocuous axioms. The most basic of these is that a stack of type P\nshould be constructible with respect to a stratification of X. (The notion of a constructible\nstack, directly analogous to the notion of a constructible sheaf, is introduced in [13]). We\ninvestigate the extent to which these stacks behave \"similarly to stacks of perverse sheaves.\"\nDate: January 2008.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\nLet us briefly recall the \"elementary construction\" of P given in [10]. (We review it in\nmore detail in section 4.) Given an abelian category A, functors F and G from A to vector\nspaces, and a natural transformation T : F \u2192 G, MacPherson and Vilonen constructed\na new category C(F, G; T ) whose objects and morphisms are given explicitly in terms of\nobjects of A, vector spaces, and linear maps. On a stratified space of the form CL \u00d7 Rk ,\nwhere L is a compact stratified space and CL is the open cone on L, they showed that\nP(CL \u00d7 Rk ) is equivalent to a category of the form C(F, G; T ), where F and G are functors\non P(L).\nOn a general stratified space X this result may be interpreted as a statement about stalks\nof the stack P: every point x \u2208 X has a neighborhood of the form CL\u00d7Rk , and the restriction\nfunctor P(CL\u00d7Rk ) \u2192 Px is an equivalence (this is equivalent to the constructibility of P), so\nthe stalks of P are equivalent to MacPherson-Vilonen constructions. Our main result is that\nthis holds for an arbitrary stack C of type P: the stalks of C are equivalent to MacPhersonVilonen constructions. To establish this we develop a rudimentary \"tilting formalism\" (as in\n[2]) for stacks of type P, another sense in which these stacks are similar to stacks of perverse\nsheaves.\nWe use this result and some basic properties of constructible stacks to obtain a finiteness\ntheorem, following an argument in [11]: if C is a stack of type P on a stratified space X\nall of whose strata are 2-connected, then the category C(X) is equivalent to the category of\nmodules over a finite-dimensional algebra.\n1.1. Statement of results. Fix an algebraically closed field F. Let us call a stack C of\ncategories on a space X an F-linear abelian stack if each category C(U) is an F-linear abelian\ncategory, and if each of the restriction functors C(U) \u2192 C(V ) is an exact F-linear functor.\nFor our conventions on stratification theory see section 1.3.\nDefinition 1.1. A stack C on a topologically stratified space (X, S) is a F-linear stack of\ntype P if it satisfies the following conditions:\n(1) C is constructible with respect to S, in the sense of [13]. Recall that this means that\nthe restriction of C to each stratum of S is locally constant.\n(2) C is an F-linear abelian stack. Each stalk category Cx has the property that all its\nobjects are of finite-length, and that all the vector spaces Hom(c, d) and Ext1 (c, d)\nare finite-dimensional.\n(3) In each stalk category Cx , there is a unique simple object sx supported on the stratum containing x. Furthermore, the Yoneda ext groups Ext1 (sx , sx ) and Ext2 (sx , sx )\nvanish.\n(4) If Z \u2282 X is a closed union of strata, and U \u2282 X is any open set, then the restriction\nfunctor C(U) \u2192 C(U \u2212 U \u2229 Z) exhibits the latter category as a Serre quotient of C(U)\nby the subcategory CZ (U) of objects supported on Z (definition 3.1).\nWe prove the following proposition in section 2:\nProposition 1.2. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space, and let p : S \u2192 Z be any\nfunction from connected strata of S to integers. The stack P = PS,p of S-constructible\np-perverse sheaves on X is a stack of type P.\n\n\fSTACKS SIMILAR TO THE STACK OF PERVERSE SHEAVES\n\n3\n\nLet us say that C has recollement operations for the stratification if one can make sense\nof the usual sheaf operations i\u2217 , i! , i\u2217 , i! in the following sense: whenever Z is a closed union\nof strata and U is an open set, the inclusion CZ (U) \u0592\u2192 C(U) and the restriction C(U) \u2192\nC(U \u2212 U \u2229 Z) admit adjoints on both sides. Here CZ (U) denotes the full subcategory of C(U)\nwhose objects are supported on Z.\nTheorem 1.3. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space, and let C be an S-constructible\nF-linear stack of type P on X.\n(1) C has recollement operations for the stratification.\n(2) Each stalk Cx is equivalent to a MacPherson-Vilonen construction. More specifically,\nif U is a regular neighborhood of x and Z \u2282 U is the closed stratum containing x,\nthen Cx is equivalent to a MacPherson-Vilonen construction C(F, G; T ), where F and\nG are functors C(U \u2212 Z) \u2192 F-Vect.\n(3) Suppose that S is a Thom-Mather stratification. If all the strata are 2-connected,\nthen the category of global objects is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional\nmodules over a finite-dimensional F-algebra.\n1.2. Further problems. Let us discuss some open questions related to the contents of this\npaper.\nProblem 1. Let X be a complex algebraic variety and let S be a Whitney stratification of X\nby complex algebraic subsets. Can one characterize the stack P of S-constructible, middleperversity perverse sheaves on X, by a list of simple axioms? This problem was formulated\nto address the \"standard complaint\" discussed above, and motivated the definition of \"stack\nof type P,\" but at some point I became skeptical that it has a nice answer.\nNote that the most interesting and beautiful properties of perverse sheaves are consequences of complex geometry or Hodge theory; a closely related question is whether these\nproperties entail anything interesting about the stack P. Our \"type P\" abstraction ignores\nthese complex algebraic features of perverse sheaves, to the point that we found it better to\ndevelop the theory in a purely topological setting.\nProblem 2. Can the usual sheaf-theory package (six operations, duality) be extended or\nmodified to the setting of stacks of abelian categories? (More plausibly, to a more hightech setting such as stacks of dg categories or stable \u221e-categories.) This paper and [13]\nconstitute, in part, an effort to start developing a structure theory for such stacks. See for\ninstance remark 3.2.\nProblem 3. In general, is the category of global objects C(X) of a stack of type P equivalent\nto the category of finite-dimensional modules over a finitely-presented algebra? This is a\ntheorem of [8] when C is the stack of perverse sheaves, but it is proved by constructing a\nvery explicit presentation for a ring, by maneuvers (such as the Fourier transform for sheaves)\nnot available in our setting. In some sense the question is whether this finiteness result holds\nfor a \"less interesting\" reason. The major obstacle to using the techniques of this paper to\nresolve this is the fact that one cannot tell from the category of finite-dimensional R-modules\nwhether R is finitely presented.\n1.3. Notation and conventions. We work throughout over an algebraically closed field\nF. If a and b are objects of an abelian category (always an F-linear abelian category), then\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\nwe will use Extn (a, b), for n > 0, to denote the Yoneda ext group of equivalence classes of\n(n + 2)-term exact sequences starting with a and ending with b.\nA prestack on a space X is a weak functorial assignment from the open subsets of X to\ncategories \u2013 that is, a 2-functor from the open subsets of X ordered by reverse inclusion to\nthe 2-category of categories. A stack on X is a prestack satisfying a local-to-global condition.\nWe refer to [13] for definitions.\nWe say that a space is 2-connected if it is connected and has vanishing first and second\nhomotopy groups.\nWe need to make some remarks about stratification theory. In this paper, we work in the\nvery general setting of topologically stratified spaces, introduced in [9]. The exception is in\nsection 5, where we introduce another technical condition \u2013 always satisfied in practice, for\ninstance on Thom-Mather stratified spaces \u2013 to our stratified spaces (that strata, not just\npoints, have regular neighborhoods). A topological stratification S of a space X is a decomposition into locally closed strata, with the property that each point has a neighborhood \u2013\ncalled regular or conical \u2013 which is homeomorphic to Rk \u00d7 CL in a stratum-preserving way.\nHere L is a compact topologically stratified space of lower dimension, and CL denotes the\nopen cone on L along with its induced decomposition. We refer to [9] and [13] for more\ndetailed definitions.\n2. Stacks of perverse sheaves\nIn this section fix a topologically stratified space (X, S) and a function p : S \u2192 Z from\nconnected strata of S to integers. Let P denote the stack of S-constructible p-perverse\nsheaves on X. The purpose of this section is to prove proposition 1.2, i.e. that P is a stack\nof type P.\nWe have to show P satisfies conditions (1) through (4) of definition 1.1. That P is Sconstructible is proved in [13], so (1) holds, and that (4) holds is proved in [1]. It remains\nto prove (2) and (3).\nProposition 2.1. The stack P satisfies condition (2) of 1.1. That is, P is an F-linear\nabelian stack, and for each point x \u2208 X, the stalk category Px has only finite-length objects\nand finite-dimensional Hom- and Ext1 -spaces.\nProof. Since P is constructible, the stalk category Px is equivalent to the category P(U) via\nthe restriction map P(U) \u2192 Px , where U is a regular neighborhood of x. The space U is\nhomeomorphic to Rk \u00d7 CL, where CL is the open cone on a compact stratified space L.\nSince L is compact, the induced stratification on U has finitely many strata. We will prove\nthat every object of P(U) has finite length by induction on the number of strata.\nLet U \u2032 \u2282 U be an open stratum. Any perverse sheaf P \u2208 P(U) fits into an exact sequence\nj ! j ! P \u2192 P \u2192 P \u2032\u2032 \u2192 0\n\np\n\nwhere P \u2032\u2032 is supported on the complement Z of U \u2032 . The space Z is homeomorphic to Rj \u00d7CM\nfor some closed M \u2282 L, so we may assume P \u2032\u2032 is of finite length by induction. The sheaf j ! P\nis a local system on U \u2032 with finite-dimensional fibers, and pj ! j ! P fits into an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Q \u2192 pj ! j ! P \u2192 j!\u2217 j ! P \u2192 0\n\n\fSTACKS SIMILAR TO THE STACK OF PERVERSE SHEAVES\n\n5\n\nwhere Q is supported on Z. Thus, pj ! j ! P is of finite length, and so P is of finite length also.\nFor n = 0, 1, the natural map ExtnP(U ) (P, Q) \u2192 HomDb (U ) (P, Q[n]) is an isomorphism,\nso to show that P(U) has finite-dimensional Hom and Ext1 spaces it suffices to show\nthat HomDb (U ) (A, B) is finite-dimensional for all cohomologically S-constructible objects\nof D b (U). We have Hom(A, B) \u223c\n= H 0 (U; RHom(A, B)), so by d\u00e9vissage it suffices to note\nthat the cohomology of an S-constructible sheaf on U \u223c\n= Rk \u00d7 CL is finite-dimensional, as L\nis compact.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.2. The stack P satisfies condition (3) of 1.1. That is, each stalk category\nPx has a unique simple object sx supported on the stratum containing x, and the Yoneda ext\ngroups Ext1 (sx , sx ) and Ext2 (sx , sx ) vanish.\nProof. As in the proof of proposition 2.1, let U be a regular neighborhood of x, so that\nP(U) \u2192 Px is an equivalence. Let Z \u2282 U be the stratum containing x, and let i : Z \u0592\u2192 U\nbe the inclusion map. The unique simple object supported on Z is i\u2217 V , where V is a 1dimensional F-vector space. We have Ext1 (i\u2217 V, i\u2217 V ) \u223c\n= H 1 (Z; F) =\n= HomDb (U ) (i\u2217 V, i\u2217 V [1]) \u223c\n0. Let\n0 \u2192 i\u2217 V \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 i\u2217 V \u2192 0\nbe a Yoneda class in Ext2 (i\u2217 V, i\u2217 V ). To see that it vanishes we need to find an object\nM \u2208 P(U) together with a filtration i\u2217 V \u2282 A \u2282 M such that M/i\u2217 V \u223c\n= i\u2217 V .\n= B and M/A \u223c\nLet C denote the image of A in B. The sequence 0 \u2192 i\u2217 V \u2192 A \u2192 C \u2192 0 induces an exact\nsequence\nHom(i\u2217 V, i\u2217 V [1]) \u2192 Hom(i\u2217 V, A[1]) \u2192 Hom(i\u2217 V, C[1]) \u2192 Hom(i\u2217 V, i\u2217 V [2])\nof hom spaces in D(U). The left- and right-hand groups are cohomology groups of Rk ,\nwhich vanish, and the middle groups are Ext1 (i\u2217 V, A) and Ext1 (i\u2217 V, C); thus Ext1 (i\u2217 V, A) \u223c\n=\n1\n1\nExt (i\u2217 V, C). We may take M to be a representative in Ext (i\u2217 V, A) corresponding to B \u2208\nExt1 (i\u2217 V, C).\n\u0003\n3. Recollement operations\nIn this section, we prove part (1) of theorem 1.3. That is, we show that a stack of type P\nhas recollement operations. Let us discuss what this means in more detail. If C is an abelian\nstack on X, and c is an object of C(U), define the support of c to be the set of all z \u2208 U such\nthat the restriction of c to the stalk Cz does not vanish. If Z is a closed subset of X we may\ndefine two new stacks CZ and CX\u2212Z on X:\nDefinition 3.1. Let Z be a closed subset of X, and let C be an abelian stack on X.\n(1) Denote by CZ the prestack that maps an open set U \u2282 X to the full subcategory\nCZ (U) \u2282 C(U) of objects that vanish under the restriction functor C(U) \u2192 C(U \u2212\nU \u2229 Z).\n(2) Denote by\n\u0001 CX\u2212Z the prestack that maps an open set U \u2282 X to the category C U \u2229\n(X \u2212 Z) .\nIt is easy to verify that these prestacks are stacks.\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\nRemark 3.2. Note that if we let i denote the inclusion Z \u0592\u2192 X, and j the inclusion\nX \u2212 Z \u0592\u2192 X, then in some sense CZ is i! i! C, and CX\u2212Z is j\u2217 j \u2217 C. In fact we even have an\nexact sequence\n0 \u2192 CZ \u2192 C \u2192 CX\u2212Z\nin the sense that CZ is a full, thick substack of C, and it is exactly the \"kernel\" of the functor\nC \u2192 CX\u2212Z . If C is of type P and Z is a closed union of strata, then we may add a zero on\nthe right as well, in the sense that the morphism C \u2192 CX\u2212Z exhibits each stalk of CX\u2212Z as\na Serre quotient of the stalk of C.\nTheorem 3.3. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space. Let C be a stack of type P,\nand let Z be a closed union of strata. Then the inclusion functor CZ \u2192 C and the quotient\nfunctor C \u2192 CX\u2212Z have adjoints on both sides.\nProof. To show that CZ \u2192 C has a left (resp. right) adjoint, it suffices to show that the\ninduced functor on stalks i\u2217 : CZ,x \u2192 Cx has a left (resp. right) adjoint for each point x \u2208 X.\nLet c be an object of Cx . Then c has finite length by definition. In particular c contains\na maximal subobject c\u2032 \u2282 c supported on Z. If c1 is any other subobject supported on Z\nthen the compositum c1 + c\u2032 is supported on Z and contains c\u2032 , so c\u2032 = c1 + c\u2032 . Thus c1 \u2282 c\u2032\nand c\u2032 is the unique maximal subobject of c supported on Z. For each c \u2208 Cx let i! c be the\nunique maximal subobject of c belonging to CZ,x . This defines a left adjoint to i\u2217 . We may\nconstruct a right adjoint by a dual process.\nNow let us show that C \u2192 CX\u2212Z has adjoints on both sides. We may factor this functor\nas\nC \u2192 CX\u2212Y \u2192 CX\u2212Z\nwhere Y is a closed union of strata with one less stratum than Z, so by induction we are\nreduced to the case where Z has only one stratum. It again suffices to show that for x \u2208 X\nthe functor Cx \u2192 CX\u2212Z,x has adjoints on both sides. When x \u2208\n/ Z this is obvious, as\nCx \u2192 CX\u2212Z,x is an equivalence.\nSuppose x \u2208 Z, and let us show that j \u2217 : Cx \u2192 CX\u2212Z,x has a right adjoint. We want to\nshow that for each c \u2208 CX\u2212Z,x , the functor d 7\u2192 Hom(j \u2217 d, c) is representable. As Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c)\nis left-exact and every object of CX\u2212Z,x has finite length, this functor is ind-representable\nby the system of objects Ei equipped with isomorphisms fi : j \u2217 Ei \u223c\n= c. If c is an extension\nof c\u2032\u2032 by c\u2032 , then the ind-object representing Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c) has finite length provided that\nthe ind-objects representing Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c\u2032\u2032 ) and Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c\u2032 ) do, as we see from the exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c\u2032 ) \u2192 Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c) \u2192 Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c\u2032\u2032 )\nThus, we are reduced to showing that Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c) is representable when c is simple.\nSuppose c is simple. Since CX\u2212Z,x is a Serre quotient of Cx , there is a unique simple object\nc\u0303 \u2208 Cx with j \u2217 c\u0303 \u223c\n= c. Let s \u2208 Cx be the simple object supported on Z. Let n be the dimension\nof Ext1 (s, c\u0303). For i = 1, . . . , n pick extension classes\n0 \u2192 c\u0303 \u2192 Yi \u2192 s \u2192 0\n1\n\nthat span Ext (s, c\u0303). Let E be the categorical pushout of the Yi over c\u0303, so that we have an\nexact sequence\n0 \u2192 c\u0303 \u2192 E \u2192 s\u2295n \u2192 0\n\n\fSTACKS SIMILAR TO THE STACK OF PERVERSE SHEAVES\n\n7\n\nNote that Hom(s, E) = 0, since in the exact sequence\nHom(s, c\u0303) \u2192 Hom(s, E) \u2192 Hom(s, s\u2295n ) \u2192 Ext1 (s, c\u0303)\nthe first group is zero (as s and c\u0303 are nonisomorphic simple objects) and the last map is an\nisomorphism by construction.\nNow consider the hom set Hom(j \u2217 d, c). Since CX\u2212Z,x is a Serre quotient, an element\nf : j \u2217 d \u2192 c may be represented by a right fraction\nd \u2192 E \u2032 \u2190 c\u0303\nwhere c\u0303 \u2192 E \u2032 is an inclusion and E \u2032 /c\u0303 is supported on Z. Since Ext1 (s, s) = 0 we in\nfact have E \u2032 /c\u0303 \u223c\n= s\u2295m for some m. We claim that there is a unique map E \u2032 \u2192 E that\ncarries c\u0303 identically onto c\u0303; indeed, the set of such maps is the inverse image of the given\ninclusion under Hom(E \u2032 , E) \u2192 Hom(c\u0303, E), but this map is injective since Hom(s\u2295m , E) =\nHom(s, E)\u2295m = 0. It follows that E represents Hom(j \u2217 \u2212, c), as desired.\nA dual proof shows that j \u2217 has a left adjoint as well.\n\u0003\n4. Recollement of abelian categories\nIn this section we prove the second part of theorem 1.3: that a stack of type P looks locally\nlike a MacPherson-Vilonen construction. A major ingredient is the recollement formalism\nintroduced in [1]. (We follow [5] in using \"recollement\" as an English word.)\nLet D \u2032 , D, D \u2032\u2032 be triangulated categories. In [1], it is shown how to construct a t-structure\non D from t-structures on D \u2032 and D \u2032\u2032 using \"recollement data\" on D \u2032 , D, D \u2032\u2032 . The recollement structure on the triangulated categories induces a kind of abelian-category recollement\nstructure on the hearts A\u2032, A, A\u2032\u2032. A simple formulation of this is strong enough for our\npurposes:\ni\n\nj\u2217\n\n\u2217\nDefinition 4.1. The data of abelian categories and functors A\u2032 \u2192\nA \u2192 A\u2032\u2032 is called a\nrecollement triple if\n(1) i\u2217 and j \u2217 are exact functors and admit adjoints on both sides.\n(2) i\u2217 is an equivalence onto the full subcategory of A annihilated by j \u2217 .\n(3) The functor A/A\u2032 \u2192 A\u2032\u2032 induced by j \u2217 is also an equivalence.\nIn this situation we will say that A is a recollement extension of A\u2032\u2032 by A\u2032.\n\nWe denote by i\u2217 the left adjoint and i! the right adjoint to i\u2217 , and j! the left adjoint and\nj\u2217 the right adjoint to j \u2217 . We also set i! =def i\u2217 and j ! =def j \u2217 . The adjunction morphisms\nprovide natural maps j! \u2192 j\u2217 and i! \u2192 i\u2217 .\nSheaves and perverse sheaves form the original example of a recollement triple: If (X, S) is\na topologically stratified space and Z is a closed union of strata, then the restriction functor\nP(X) \u2192 P(X \u2212 Z) and the extension-by-zero functor P(Z) \u2192 P(X) exhibit P(X) as a\nrecollement extension of P(X \u2212 Z) by P(X). Here P can be the category of S-constructible\nperverse sheaves of any fixed perversity. In [10] another class of examples was introduced:\nExample 4.2. Suppose we are given a right exact functor F : A\u2032\u2032 \u2192 A\u2032 , a left exact\nfunctor G : A\u2032\u2032 \u2192 A\u2032 , and a natural transformation T : F \u2192 G. The MacPherson-Vilonen\ncategory C = C(F, G; T ) is the category of \"factorizations of T \": its objects are tuples\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\n(A\u2032\u2032 , A\u2032 , m, n) where m : F (A\u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 A\u2032 , n : A\u2032 \u2192 G(A\u2032\u2032 ), and n \u25e6 m = TA\u2032\u2032 . The functors\nj \u2217 : (A\u2032\u2032 , A\u2032 , m, n) 7\u2192 A\u2032\u2032 and i\u2217 : A\u2032 7\u2192 (0, A\u2032 , 0, 0) exhibit C as a recollement extension of A\u2032\u2032\nby A\u2032 .\nIn [10], MacPherson and Vilonen construct a functor P(X) \u2192 C(F, G; T ), for certain\nF, G : P(X \u2212 Z) \u2192 P(Z). The functor respects all the recollement data, and it is an\nequivalence when Z is contractible. Since C(F, G; T ) is described pretty explicitly (up to a\ndescription of A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 ), this can be regarded as a \"calculation\" of P(X).\nOne of the features of the MacPherson-Vilonen construction is that the inclusion i\u2217 : A\u2032 \u2192\nC admits an exact retraction: one may take (A\u2032\u2032 , A\u2032 , m, n) 7\u2192 A\u2032 . On the other hand if a\nrecollement triple A\u2032 \u2192 A \u2192 A\u2032\u2032 admits an exact retract r : A \u2192 A\u2032 one can use it to\nbuild a functor from A to a MacPherson-Vilonen category C(F, G; T ) for some F , G, and\nT . Namely, take F = r \u25e6 j! and G = r \u25e6 j\u2217 , and take T to be the retract r applied to the\nnatural map j! \u2192 j\u2217 . Then\n\u0001\nA \u2192 C(F, G; T ) : A 7\u2192 F (j \u2217 A) \u2192 r(A) \u2192 G(j \u2217 A)\nis an exact functor.\nIn [10], for perverse sheaves, a retract P(X) \u2192 P(Z) is built out of analytic or topological\ninformation, using vanishing cycles or perverse links. One point of the second part of theorem\n1.3 is that a retract exists for formal reasons:\nLemma 4.3. Let A be an F-linear abelian category, such that every object has finite length,\nand such that each Hom(a, b) and each Ext1 (a, b) are finite-dimensional over F. Let s be a\nsimple object in A with Ext1 (s, s) = 0. Then the recollement triple\nF-Vect \u2192 A \u2192 A/s\nwhere the first functor maps Fn to s\u2295n , admits an exact retraction.\nProof. We have to construct an exact functor A \u2192 F-Vect that takes s to F. Gabriel\nconstructed a pro-representable such functor in [7], in greater generality, but we give a\nconstruction here as well. An indecomposable cover of s is an object x together with a\nsurjection x \u2192 s that exhibits s as the cosocle of x \u2013 i.e. as the largest semisimple quotient\nof x. Such an x is necessarily indecomposable.\nIf y \u2192 s is any surjection, it is easily verified that y contains an indecomposable cover of\ns. If x is an indecomposable cover of s, it is also easily verified that any map from y to x\nover s is surjective.\nWe want to consider the limit of all indecomposable covers of s. Let Cs denote the category\nof indecomposable covers of s, and let C\u0303s denote any filtered category with a functor C\u0303s \u2192 Cs\nthat is surjective on morphisms (i.e. any morphism f \u2208 Cs is the value of some morphism\nf \u2208 C\u0303s ). Set\nPs (a) = lim Hom(x, a)\n\u2212\u2192\nx\u2208C\u0303s\n\nThen Ps (t) = 0 for any simple t 6= s, since s is the cosocle of each x, and Ps (s) = F since\nHom(x, s) = F for each x. It remains to show that Ps is exact. Let\n0\u2192a\u2192b\u2192c\u21920\n\n\fSTACKS SIMILAR TO THE STACK OF PERVERSE SHEAVES\n\n9\n\nbe a short exact sequence in A; each x \u2208 Cs induces an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Hom(x, a) \u2192 Hom(x, b) \u2192 Hom(x, c) \u2192 Ext1 (x, a)\nSince, C\u0303s is filtered, the sequence\n0 \u2192 Ps (a) \u2192 Ps (b) \u2192 Ps (c) \u2192 lim Ext1 (x, a)\n\u2212\u2192\nis exact as well. To see that Ps is exact one needs to show the limit of Ext1 s vanishes.\nSuppose y is an extension of x by a; we want to find an x\u2032 mapping to x such that the fiber\nproduct y \u00d7x x\u2032 \u2192 x\u2032 splits. But we may take for x\u2032 any indecomposable cover of s contained\nin y.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.4. Note that the retraction A \u2192 F-Vect constructed has the further property\nthat it kills simple objects not isomorphic to s.\nDefine an additive functor j!\u2217 : A\u2032\u2032 \u2192 A by taking a\u2032\u2032 to the image of j! a\u2032\u2032 in j\u2217 a\u2032\u2032 . We\nmention the following proposition, from [1]:\nProposition 4.5. The functor j!\u2217 preserves simples. Furthermore, every simple in A is of\nthe form i! s where s is simple in A\u2032 , or of the form j!\u2217 s where s is simple in A\u2032\u2032 .\nLet A and B be two recollement extensions of A\u2032\u2032 by A\u2032 . If one is given an exact functor\nR : A \u2192 B, together with natural isomorphisms R \u25e6 i\u2217 \u223c\n= j \u2217 , then using the\n= i\u2217 and j \u2217 \u25e6 R \u223c\nadjunctions we may define maps R \u25e6 j\u2217 \u2192 j\u2217 , j! \u2192 R \u25e6 j! , i\u2217 \u25e6 R \u2192 i\u2217 , and i! \u2192 i! \u25e6 R.\ni\n\nj\u2217\n\ni\n\nj\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nDefinition 4.6.

A\nmorphism of recollement extensions from A to B is an exact functor R : A \u2192 B together\nwith isomorphisms R \u25e6 i\u2217 \u223c\n= i\u2217 and j \u2217 \u25e6 R \u223c\n= j \u2217 , such that the induced morphisms R \u25e6 j\u2217 \u2192 j\u2217 ,\n\u2217\n\u2217\n!\n!\nj! \u2192 R \u25e6 j! , i \u25e6 R \u2192 i , and i \u2192 i \u25e6 R are isomorphisms.\n\nNow let C be a stack of type P on X. For each point x \u2208 X, the stalk Cx has a unique\nsimple sx supported on the stratum containing x. Since Ext1 (sx , sx ) = 0, the recollement\ntriple\nF-Vect \u2192 Cx \u2192 Cx /sx\nadmits a retraction r by lemma 4.3. The retraction induces a functor R : Cx \u2192 C(F, G; T ),\nwhere F and G map Cx /sx to F-Vect. Note that, if U is a regular neighborhood of x and Y\nis the stratum containing x, then Cx /sx \u223c\n= C(U \u2212 U \u2229 Y ).\nProposition 4.7. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space, and let C be a stack of type\nP on X. Let x \u2208 X and F, G, and R be as above. The functor R : Cx \u2192 C(F, G; T ) is fully\nfaithful.\nProof. The functor R is clearly faithful. We will show that it is full following the proof\nof proposition 1.2 in [14]. We have to show that for c and d in Cx the map Hom(c, d) \u2192\nHom(Rc, Rd) is an isomorphism. This is clear from the adjunctions in case d is of the form\nj\u2217 d\u2032 for some d\u2032 \u2208 Cx /sx , or of the form s\u2295n\nx . In the latter case we furthermore have that\n1\n1\nExt (c, sx ) \u2192 Ext (Rc, Rsx ) is injective, since if 0 \u2192 sx \u2192 E \u2192 c \u2192 0 is an exact sequence\nwhich splits after applying R, then we may lift a retraction RE \u2192 Rsx to E \u2192 sx , using\nthe fact that Hom(E, sx ) \u223c\n= Hom(RE, Rsx ).\n\n\f10\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\nFor a general d, consider the exact sequence 0 \u2192 K \u2192 d \u2192 j\u2217 j \u2217 d \u2192 C \u2192 0. The\nobjects K and C are direct sums of copies of sx . Let I be the image of d in j\u2217 j \u2217 d; since\nHom(c, j\u2217 j \u2217 d) \u223c\n= Hom(Rc, RC) the map Hom(c, I) \u2192\n= Hom(Rc, Rj\u2217 j \u2217 d) and Hom(c, C) \u223c\nHom(Rc, RI) is also an isomorphism.

Tilting extensions. To show that R is essentially surjective we will follow the proofs\nof the first two propositions of [2]. We need to translate some of the tilting formalism into\nour context. Let us say that an object M of either Cx or C(F, G; T ) is tilting if we have\nExt1 (sx , M) = 0 and Ext1 (M, sx ) = 0.\nProposition 4.8. Let c be an object of Cx /sx . There is a tilting object ctilt such that Rctilt\nis also tilting, and such that j \u2217 ctilt \u223c\n= j \u2217 Rctilt \u223c\n= c.\nProof. Consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 a \u2192 j! c \u2192 j\u2217 c \u2192 b \u2192 0\nin Cx . Since Ext2 (b, a) = 0 we may find an object ctilt containing j! c as a subobject and\nisomorphisms ctilt /a \u223c\n= b. The short exact sequences\n= j\u2217 c and ctilt /j! c \u223c\nExt1 (sx , a) \u2192 Ext1 (sx , ctilt ) \u2192 Ext1 (sx , j\u2217 c)\nand\nExt1 (j! c, sx ) \u2192 Ext1 (ctilt , sx ) \u2192 Ext1 (b, sx )\nshow that the middle Ext1 -groups vanish and that ctilt is tilting. The analogous exact\nsequences in C(F, G; T ) show that Rctilt is tilting as well.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.9. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space, and let C be a stack of type P\non X. Let x \u2208 X and F, G, T , and R be as above. The functor R : Cx \u2192 C(F, G; T ) is an\nequivalence of categories.\nRemark 4.10. A similar theorem is the main result of [6]. There, a criterion is given\nfor a functor between two different recollement extensions of abelian categories to be an\nequivalence, and this criterion is essentially a weakened form of our axiom (3). However, it\nis also assumed that the categories involved have enough projectives, which is not the case\nin our situation, so we cannot apply this result directly.\nProof. After proposition 4.7 it remains to show that R is essentially surjective. For each\nc \u2208 Cx /sx let E1 (c) be the category of lifts of c to Cx and let E2 (c) be the category of lifts of\nc to C(F, G; T ). To show that R is essentially surjective it suffices to show that R induces\nan equivalence of categories E1 (c) \u2192 E2 (c).\n\n\fSTACKS SIMILAR TO THE STACK OF PERVERSE SHEAVES\n\n11\n\nLet us fix a tilting object ctilt \u2208 Cx as in proposition 4.8. Set \u03a8(c) = i! ctilt and \u03a8\u2032 (c) =\ni c , let \u03c4 denote the natural map \u03a8 \u2192 \u03a8\u2032 , and let F(c) be the category of factorizations\n\u03a8 \u2192 \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8\u2032 of \u03c4 . We will construct equivalences E1 (c) \u223c\n= F(c) commuting\n= F(c) and E2 (c) \u223c\nwith the functor E1 \u2192 E2 , which will imply that it is an equivalence.\nFor each c\u0303 \u2208 E1 (c) consider the complex\n\u2217 tilt\n\nK(c\u0303) := [* * * 0 \u2192 j! c \u2192 c\u0303 \u2295 ctilt \u2192 j\u2217 c \u2192 0 * * * ]\nin Cx associated to the following commutative square, regarded as a double complex:\nj! c\n\nctilt\n/\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/\n\nc\u0303\n\nj\u2217 c\n\nIn this square, the top arrow is injective and the right arrow is surjective; furthermore, all\nfour maps are isomorphisms modulo sx . It follows that the cohomology of this complex is\nconcentrated in degree zero, and is supported on the stratum containing x. Define \u03a6(c\u0303) =\nH 0 (K(c\u0303)). The morphism \u03a8 \u2192 \u03a6 is defined at the level of complexes:\nctilt\n/\n\n0\n\n/\n\nj\u2217 c\n=\n\n(0,id)\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nj! c\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nc\u0303 \u2295 ctilt\n/\n\nj\u2217 c\n\nand the morphism \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8\u2032 is defined similarly.\nWe may define a similar functor E2 \u2192 F by using Rctilt in place of ctilt ; the map E1 \u2192 F\nis then isomorphic to the composition E1 \u2192 E2 \u2192 F.\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\nNow let us define an inverse functor F \u2192 E1 . We will send \u03a8 \u2192 \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8\u2032 to a subquotient\nof i! \u03a6 \u2295 ctilt . Namely, we send it to the cohomology of the complex L(\u03a6) = L(\u03a6, \u03b1, \u03b2), also\nobtained from a commutative square:\nL(\u03a6) := [\u03a8 \u2192 \u03a6 \u2295 ctilt \u2192 \u03a8\u2032 ]\nNote that L(K(c\u0303)) is the cohomology of the complex associated to the following double\ncomplex:\n=\n/ j! c\n/ j! c\n0\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nc\n\ntilt\n\n\u000f\n\nj\u2217 c\n\n/\n\nc\u0303 \u2295 c\n\n=\n\n\u000f\n\ntilt\n\n\u2295 ctilt\n/\n\nctilt\n\n\u000f\n/\n\nj\u2217 c\n\n\u000f\n/\n\n0\n\nThe top and bottom rows of this complex are acyclic, and the cohomology of the middle row\nis easily seen to be c\u0303. A natural isomorphism K(L(\u03a6)) \u223c\n= \u03a6 may be constructed similarly, so\nthe functor E1 \u2192 F is an equivalence. Replacing ctilt with Rctilt in the above shows E2 \u2192 F\nis an equivalence as well. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\n5. The category of global objects\nIn this section, we prove part (3) of theorem 1.3. That is, we show that the category\nC(X) of global objects of a stack of type P, on a space with 2-connected strata, is equivalent\nto the category of modules over a finite-dimensional algebra. The proof requires us to add\nan additional assumption to our stratification: that strata \"have regular neighborhoods\"\nas in the following definition. I do not know whether this condition is satisfied for every\ntopologically stratified space, but it is always satisfied in practice \u2013 for instance, ThomMather stratifications come with such neighborhoods or \"tube systems\" by definition.\nDefinition 5.1. Let S be a stratum in a topologically stratified space (X, S). A regular\nneighborhood for S is a tuple (U, L, \u03c0), where U \u2282 X is an open subset containing S, L\nis another topologically stratified space, and \u03c0 : U \u2192 S is a continuous map that exhibits\nU as a fiber bundle with fiber CL, the open cone on L. We furthermore assume that the\ntransition functions for a local trivialization of \u03c0 can be taken to be stratum-preserving.\nLet us say that (X, S) has regular neighborhoods if every stratum of X has a regular\nneighborhood.\nLemma 5.2. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space, and let C be an S-constructible\nstack on X. Let S be a stratum of X and let (U, L, \u03c0) be a regular neighborhood of S.\nLet i denote the inclusion map S \u0592\u2192 X. Then there is a natural equivalence of stacks\ni\u2217 C \u223c\n= \u03c0\u2217 (C|U ).\nIn particular, the category (i\u2217 C)(S) of global objects of i\u2217 C is equivalent to the category\nC(U) = \u03c0\u2217 C(S) of C-objects defined over U.\nProof. If S \u2032 is an open subset of S then the restriction functors C(\u03c0 \u22121 (S \u2032 )) \u2192 C(V ) assemble\nto a functor C(\u03c0 \u22121 (S \u2032 )) \u2192 2limV C(V ), where V runs through the open subsets of \u03c0 \u22121 (S \u2032 )\n\u2212\u2192\ncontaining S \u2032 . This defines a morphism from \u03c0\u2217 C to the prestack i\u2217p C, which in turn maps\nnaturally to i\u2217 C, the stackification of i\u2217p C. To see that the composition of these morphisms is\nan equivalence it suffices to show that for each s \u2208 S, the functor on stalks (\u03c0\u2217 C)s \u2192 (i\u2217 C)s is\nan equivalence (note that (i\u2217 C)s is naturally equivalent to Cs ). Let W \u2282 S be a contractible\nneighborhood of s. Then \u03c0 \u22121 (W ) is a conical neighborhood of s in U. It follows from\ntheorem 3.13 of [13] that we have Cs \u223c\n= \u03c0\u2217 C(W ) = C(\u03c0 \u22121 (W )).\n= C(\u03c0 \u22121 (W )) and (\u03c0\u2217 C)s \u223c\nThis completes the proof.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.3. Let (X, S) be a topologically stratified space that has regular neighborhoods,\nand let C be a stack of type P on X. Suppose that (X, S) has only finitely many strata, and\nthat each stratum is 2-connected. Then the category C(X) is equivalent to the category of\nfinite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional F-algebra.\nProof. We will induct on the number of strata. Suppose first there is only one stratum. Then\nthe assumptions imply C is locally constant and X is 2-connected. By the main theorem of\n[12] (see also theorem 5.7 of [13]) and the fact that X is 2-connected, C is actually constant.\nIt follows that C(X) is equivalent to the stalk category Cx for some point x \u2208 X. By axiom\n(3) of definition 1.1, this category is equivalent to the category of F-vector spaces, which is\na category of modules over a finite-dimensional F-algebra.\n\n\fSTACKS SIMILAR TO THE STACK OF PERVERSE SHEAVES\n\n13\n\nNow suppose that (X, S) has n strata and that we have proved the theorem for all spaces\nwith \u2264 (n \u2212 1) strata. Let Z \u2282 X be a closed stratum of X, and let (U, L, \u03c0) be a regular\nneighborhood of Z. Since Z is 2-connected and i\u2217 C (resp. CZ ) is locally constant on Z, we\nsee that i\u2217 C (resp. CZ ) is constant and i\u2217 C(Z) \u223c\n= F-Vect) for a\n= CZ,z \u223c\n= Cz , (resp. CZ (Z) \u223c\n\u2217\n\u223c\npoint z \u2208 Z. By lemma 5.2, i C(Z) = C(U). Thus, the recollement triple\nj\u2217\n\ni\n\nU\nU\u2217\nC(U \u2212 Z)\nC(U) \u2192\nCZ (U) \u2192\n\nis equivalent to the triple\nF-Vect \u2192 Cx \u2192 Cx /sx\nIn particular, iU \u2217 has a retraction rU : C(U) \u2192 CZ (U) which induces an equivalence to a\nMacPherson-Vilonen construction, by theorem 4.9. The recollement triple\nCZ (X) \u2192 C(X) \u2192 C(X \u2212 Z)\nr\n\nres\n\nalso has a retraction rX given by C(X) \u2192 C(U) \u2192 CZ (U) = CZ (X) = C(X), and we will\nshow that rX induces an equivalence to a MacPherson-Vilonen construction as well.\nSet FU = rU (jU ! ), GU = rU (jU \u2217 ), let TU be the natural map FU \u2192 GU , and let RU denote\nthe functor C(U) \u2192 C(FU , GU ; TU ) induced by rU . Define FX , GX , TX and RX : C(X) \u2192\nC(FX , GX ; TX ) similarly. By theorem 4.9, RU is an equivalence. The recollement triple\nCZ (X) \u2192 C(X) \u2192 C(X \u2212 Z)\nr\n\nres\n\nalso has a retraction rX given by C(X) \u2192 C(U) \u2192 CZ (U) = CZ (X) = C(X). The functor rX\ninduces a functor C(X) \u2192 C(FX , GX ; TX ).\nSince C is a stack, we have a weak pullback square of categories:\nC(X)\n\nC(X \u2212 Z)\n/\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nC(U)\n/\n\nC(U \u2212 Z)\n\nConcretely, this means C(X) is equivalent to the category of triples (c1 , c2 , \u03b8), where c1 \u2208\nC(U), c2 \u2208 C(X \u2212 Z), and \u03b8 is an isomorphism between c1 |U \u2212Z and c2 |U \u2212Z . To show RX is\nan equivalence, it suffices to show that the square\nC(FX , GX ; TX )\n\nC(X \u2212 Z)\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nC(FU , GU ; TU )\n/\n\nC(U \u2212 Z)\n\nis also a weak pullback. That is, we must show that C(FX , GX ; TX ) is equivalent to the\ncategory of triples (M, b2 , \u03b8), where\nm\n\nn\n\nM = (FU (b1 ) \u2192 V \u2192 GU (b1 )) is an object of C(FU , GU ; TU )\nb2 is an object of C(X \u2212 Z)\n\u03b8 is an isomorphism between b1 and b2 |U \u2212Z .\n\n\f14\n\nDAVID TREUMANN\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\nBut we have FX (b2 ) = FU (b2 |U \u2212Z ) \u223c\n= GU (b1 ) by defini= FU (b1 ) and GX (b2 ) = GU (b2 |U \u2212Z ) \u223c\ntion, so the assignment (M, b2 , \u03b8) 7\u2192 (FX (b2 ) \u2192 V \u2192 GX (b2 )) is an equivalence of categories.\nBy the inductive hypothesis C(X) is equivalent to a category built from a category of finitedimensional modules over a finite-dimensional F-algebra A via a C(F, G; T )-construction,\nwith F, G : A-mod \u2192 F-Vect. By construction every object of this category has finite length,\nand every hom set is a finite-dimensional F-vector space. To show that such a category is the\ncategory of finite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional F-algebra it suffices to show\nthat it has enough projectives, and this follows from proposition 2.5 of [11]. This completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements: I would like to thank Mark Goresky, Bob MacPherson, Andrew Snowden, Kari Vilonen, and Zhiwei Yun.
