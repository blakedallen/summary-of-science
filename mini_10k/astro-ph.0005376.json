We present new mid-infrared (MIR) diagnostics to distinguish emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nfrom that originating in starburst regions. Our method\nuses empirical spectroscopic criteria based on the fact\nthat MIR emission from star forming or active galaxies\narises mostly from HII regions, photo-dissociation regions\n(PDRs) and AGNs. The analysis of the strength of the\n6.2 \u03bcm Unidentified Infrared Band (UIB) and the MIR\ncontinuum shows that UIBs are very faint or absent in\nregions harboring the intense and hard radiation fields of\nAGNs and pure HII regions, where the UIB carriers could\nbe destroyed. The MIR signature of AGNs is the presence\nof an important continuum in the 3-10 \u03bcm band which\noriginates from very hot dust heated by the intense AGN\nradiation field. Using these two distinct spectral properties found in our MIR templates, we build diagnostic diagrams which provide quantitative estimates of the AGN,\nPDR and HII region contribution in a given MIR spectrum. This new MIR classification can be used to reveal\nthe presence of AGNs highly obscured by large columns\nof dust.\nKey words: Galaxies: active \u2013 Galaxies: starburst \u2013 Infrared: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nSince the discovery by IRAS of ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies (L(8-1000 \u03bcm) > 1012 L\u2299 ) which emit the bulk\nof their energy in the infrared, a large number of studies have shown that intense star forming regions as well as\nSend offprint requests to: O.

Large concentrations of molecular gas are needed for fueling nuclear starbursts and/or AGNs. Consequently, absorption makes the\ndistinction between starburst and AGN activity difficult\nand the estimate of their relative contribution to the total\ninfrared luminosity is far from straightforward. Optical\nclassification (Veilleux et al. 1995, Goldader et al. 1995,\nKim et al. 1998) is plagued by extinction, while radio wavelengths, although free from extinction, do not\nresult in a definite classification (Condon et al. 1991,\nLonsdale et al. 1993, Smith et al. 1998). Based on X-ray\nobservations (Ogasaka et al. 1997, Risaliti et al. 2000),\nground-based infrared observations (Roche et al. 1991,\nDudley 1999, Murphy et al. 1999, Soifer et al. 2000) and\non ISO observations (Genzel et al. 1998, Lutz et al. 1998,\nRigopoulou et al. 1999), considerable progress has been\nmade in defining the fraction of the AGN/Starburst contributions to the bolometric luminosity of ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies.\nTo further examine the AGN and starburst connection,\nwe have observed a sample of nearby active and interacting\ngalaxies harboring starburst regions and/or AGNs using\nISOCAM. Due to the unique spectro-imaging capabilities\nof the camera which provide an angular resolution of 48 arcsec between 5 and 16 \u03bcm (200-400 pc at 10 Mpc), we\ncan reveal and study obscured central regions not visible\nat optical wavelengths (A15 \u03bcm \u223c AV /70, Mathis 1990).\nThe goal of this paper is to present an empirical\nmethod to distinguish and quantify the MIR emission\ncoming from starbursts and AGNs. Our approach is based\non a new MIR diagnostic for estimating the relative importance of these two main energy sources found in galactic centers. Our sample and the data reduction methods\nare described in section 2. A brief summary of the typical\nMIR emission encountered in these galaxies is presented\nin section 3, while our MIR templates and diagnostic dia-\n\n\f2\n\nLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\ngrams are shown in section 4. We discuss our results and\ntheir implications in section 5 and the final conclusions\nare given in section 6.\n2. Observations and data reduction\nA large sample of nearby galaxies hosting star formation\nactivity and AGN signatures (see Table 1) was observed\nwith the ISOCAM camera (Cesarsky et al. 1996) on board\nthe Infrared Space Observatory (ISO, Kessler et al. 1996).\nAll observations come from the ISOCAM consortium\nguaranteed time programs and most of them were part of\nthe active galaxy proposal CAMACTIV (P.I. I.F. Mirabel,\ne.g.\nCharmandaris et al. 1999,\nMirabel et al. 1998,\nGallais et al. 1998, Mirabel et al. 1999). These galaxies\nhave been observed either in the spectro-imaging mode\nwith the Circular Variable Filter (CVF) or in the raster\nmode with broad band filters.\nThe CVF covers a spectral range from 5 to 16 \u03bcm\nwith a spectral resolution of \u223c 40. For CVF scans, a\nsingle pointing was made for each galaxy, using 1.53 arcsec/pixels, giving a total field of view for the 32\u00d732\npixel array of 0.8-1.6 arcmin. The spatial resolution is\n4-8 arcsec limited by the full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF). High spatial\nresolution and sensitivity are essential in our analysis in\norder to isolate the central regions in nearby galaxies. Approximately 12 exposures of 2-5s each were made at each\nwavelength in addition to \u223c 20 exposures at the start of\neach observation to decrease the initial detector transient\neffects.\nThe raster maps were made with various broad band\nfilters designed to select distinct features such as the\ncontinuum emission of the very small grains using the\nLW3(12-18 \u03bcm) filter, and the UIBs with the LW2(58.5 \u03bcm) and LW4(5.5-6.5 \u03bcm) filters. Depending on the\napparent size of the galaxy, a pixel field of view of 1.5 or\n3 arcsec was selected. Most of the maps were 2\u00d72 rasters\nwith 6 pixel overlap consisting of approximately 200 exposures of 2-5s each. Another 30 exposures were added\nat the start of the observations to decrease the effects of\ntransients.\nThe ISOCAM data were analyzed with the CAM Interactive Analysis software (CIA1 ) and were calibrated with\nthe general methods described in Starck et al. (1999). To\ncorrect for the dark current, a dark model taking into account the observing time parameters was subtracted. Cosmic ray hits were removed by applying a multiresolution\nmedian filtering (Starck et al. 1996). Corrections of detector memory effects were made with the so-called inversion\nmethod (Abergel et al. 1996). The flat field correction was\nperformed using the library of calibration data. Finally, individual exposures were combined using shift techniques\n1\n\nCIA is a joint development by the ESA astrophysics division and the ISOCAM consortium led by the ISOCAM PI, C.\nCesarsky, Direction des Sciences de la mati\u00e8re, C.E.A. France.\n\nin order to correct the jitter effect due to the satellite motions (amplitude \u223c 0.5 arcsec). To derive the photometry\nof individual galaxy regions, aperture corrections as well\nas deconvolution techniques (Starck et al. 1998), were applied to account for the overall extension of the PSF in\na few cases. We estimate that the absolute uncertainty of\nour photometric measurements is \u223c 20% while the error in\nthe relative uncertainty mainly due to errors on transient\neffect correction is \u223c10%.\n3. MIR emission of normal, starburst galaxies\nand AGNs.\nMIR spectra (5-16 \u03bcm) in galaxies can mainly arise from\na variety of physical components including: 1) the evolved\nstellar population (Rayleigh-Jeans regime), which can\ndominate in early-type galaxies, 2) emission from the\nionized interstellar gas, 3) non-thermal emission from\nradio sources and 4) dust particules responsible for the\nunderlying continuum and 5) carriers of UIBs centered at\n6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 \u03bcm. The UIBs are thought to\nbe due to C=C and C\u2013H stretching and bending vibration\nmodes in carbonaceous materials (L\u00e9ger & Puget 1984,\nAllamandola et al. 1985, Papoular et al. 1989) and they\ndominate the MIR spectra of galaxies with low or\nintermediate star formation activity (Mattila et al. 1999)\nas in PDRs (Klein et al. 1999) and diffuse galactic\nregions (Giard et al. 1988, Mattila et al. 1996). The dust\nemitting longward of about 10 \u03bcm, is attributed to Very\nSmall Grains (here-after VSGs) with radius less than\n10 nm (D\u00e9sert et al. 1990), and is prominent in regions\nactively forming stars, such as Galactic HII regions (e.g.\nVerstraete et al. 1996, Cesarsky et al. 1996b) and in starburst regions. To emit in the MIR, the carriers of the UIBs\nand the VSGs are thought to be stochastically heated by\nthe stellar radiation field reaching temperature fluctuations of the order of 100-1000 K (Puget & L\u00e9ger 1989,\nD\u00e9sert et al. 1990). The emission from ionized gas\nis mainly observed through forbidden lines such\nas [ArII](6.9 \u03bcm), [NeVI](7.6 \u03bcm), [ArIII](8.9 \u03bcm),\n[SIV](10.5 \u03bcm), [NeII](12.8 \u03bcm), [NeV](14.3 \u03bcm) and\n[NeIII](15.6 \u03bcm). Because of their high ionization potential, these lines can be used to trace the hardness of the\nradiation field. The presence of [NeVI] and [NeV] has\nalso provided evidence for AGNs (Moorwood et al. 1996,\nGenzel et al. 1998, Sturm et al. 2000) or supernova\nremnants (Oliva et al. 1999).\nIn order to understand how the total MIR emission\nin our sample of starbursts and AGNs varies according\nto these different contributions, we first review the wellstudied MIR properties in resolved nearby galaxies from\nearly-type to later type disk galaxies and then address our\nobservations in light of these properties.\n\n\fLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\n3\n\nNGC 7023\n\nHII\n\nPDR-H 2\n\nVSG continuum\n\nFig. 1. Typical spectrum of a quiescent star forming\nregion. The MIR spectrum (5-16 \u03bcm) of a disk region of M82 away from the central starburst (thick\nsolid line), chosen for its high signal to noise ratio,\nis compared to a modeled spectrum (dashed line) including a continuum and UIBs. The dust continuum\ndue to the VSGs is modeled by a black-body curve\n(T=200 K) reddened by a dust absorption law with\nAV =6 mag (Dudley & Wynn-Williams 1997). The UIBs\nmarked with the rest wavelength of their peak emission\nare modeled by lorentzian profiles (thin solid lines) (cf.\nBoulanger et al. 1998). Note the faint [NeIII] emission and\nthe probable contamination of the [NeII]12.8 \u03bcm line with\nthe 12.7 \u03bcm UIB feature. Faint UIBs are also detected at\n5.3, 5.7, 12.0, 13.6, and 14.3 \u03bcm as in many other galaxies\nof our sample.\n3.1. MIR emission of \"normal\" galaxies: early to late\ntype\nThe MIR spectra of elliptical galaxies, usually poor in cold\ngas and dust, are produced primarily by their evolved stellar population, and can be shown to resemble a blackbody continuum with temperatures ranging from 4000\nto 6000K (Madden et al. 1997, Boselli et al. 1998). This\nstellar emission accounts for most of the MIR emission of some elliptical galaxies. However, a non-negligible\nfraction of elliptical galaxies shows emission from UIBs\nand hot dust (Knapp et al. 1996a, Knapp et al. 1996b,\nMadden et al. 1999), as well as emission from non-thermal\nsources.\nThe MIR spectra of spiral galaxies, rich in gas and\ndust, are largely dominated by the UIBs. The observed\nUIB features show little spectral variations, and the total broad band LW3(12-18 \u03bcm)/LW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm) flux ratio is close to 1 (Boselli et al. 1998, Roussel et al. 1999a,\nRoussel et al. 1999b). This ratio has been proposed as\nan indicator of the fraction of the VSG continuum to\nthe UIB feature emission. As an example of the \"typ-\n\nM 17\n\nFig. 2. MIR spectra showing the variation of the SED\nfrom a pure HII region, depicted by a solid line (close\nto OB stars in M17, Cesarsky et al. 1996b), to an\nisolated PDR indicated by a dotted line (NGC 7023,\nCesarsky et al. 1996a). Each spectrum was normalized to\nthe continuum at 10 \u03bcm. The evolution is indicated by the\nvertical arrow which shows how the spectrum changes as\nwe move from the outskirts of the HII region (dotted line)\ntowards its core and near the OB stars (dashed and solid\nlines). Note how the strength of the UIBs progressively\ndiminishes and how the continuum emission increases.\nical\" integrated MIR emission of normal spiral galaxies, we present in Figure 1 the spectrum of a region\nin the disk of M82, 45 arcsec away from the central\nstarburst. The usual UIB features, fitted by lorentzian\nprofiles, are prominent. In addition, we notice the\npresence of several faint UIBs at 5.3, 5.7, 12.0, 13.6\nand 14.3 \u03bcm (Verstraete et al. 1996, Beintema et al. 1996,\nSloan et al. 1999). Similar MIR spectra are also found\nin regions of the Galactic disk (Cesarsky et al. 1996a,\nBoulanger et al. 1996).\n3.2. MIR emission of starburst galaxies.\nThe MIR spectra of galaxies with evidence of starburst\nactivity have distinct features compared to normal spiral galaxies. Their most prominent characteristic is the\npresence of a very steeply rising continuum at 12-16 \u03bcm\nfrom the VSGs. In starburst regions, this continuum is\nprimarily produced in HII regions, tracing regions of massive star formation activity. The hard radiation field from\nyoung stars also excites ionic lines from [ArII], [ArIII],\n[SIV], [NeII] and [NeIII] which can be seen in the MIR\nspectra of starbursts. We display an example of this continuum in Figure 2 (solid line) using the spectrum near\na pure HII region observed in M17, where the MIR emission is almost completely dominated by the VSG continuum (Cesarsky et al. 1996b).

The top includes nuclei of galaxies containing an AGN, the middle\ncontains regions harboring starburst activity and the bottom presents quiescent star forming regions. The spectral type column\nindicates which of the three components (HII, PDR or AGN) provides the dominant contribution. Two values, one according\nto our broad band diagnostic (left column, see also Fig. 8) and one based on the CVF diagnostic (right column, see also Fig.6)\nare presented. The broad band fluxes for most galaxies have been calculated from their CVF spectra. NGC 7252 was observed\nin the CVF mode but due to its weak continuum emission the errors of the CVF diagnostic are large so we include only\nthe LW classification. In NGC 4676(A), the MIR spectral energy distribution is probably contaminated by stellar emission\n(Hibbard & van Gorkom 1996, Read & Ponman 1998).\nNotation used: \"Nuc\"= nucleus with the diameter in arcsec, \"Disk\"= well detected star formation region in the disk.\nReferences: 1 This work; 2 Laurent et al. 1999a; 3 Laurent et al. 1999c; 4 Charmandaris et al. 2000; 5 Laurent et al. 1997; 6\nLaurent et al. 2000a; 7 Laurent et al. 1999b; 8 Mirabel et al. 1998; 9 Charmandaris et al. 1999; 10 Mirabel et al. 1999. The\nidentification of specific regions in Arp 299, NGC 4038 and NGC 4676 follows the usual notation found in the literature. Galaxies\nmarked with \u2020 have been observed only in broad band filter mode (LW). Galaxies marked with + identify those which clearly\nfall outside the limits of our diagnostic, as shown in Figure 6 and 8 and are classified to their nearest MIR spectral type. The\ngalaxies marked by \u2217 have not been previously classified as AGN-dominant, but have MIR characteristics which our diagnostics\nsuggest as those of an AGN.\n\n\fLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nis interpreted as a consequence of the destruction of their\ncarriers. However, since the UIBs originate from diffuse\nregions as well as PDRs surrounding HII regions, where\nthey peak (Cesarsky et al. 1996a, Verstraete et al. 1996,\nMattila et al. 1996, Tran 1998), strong UIBs can be detected in the MIR spectrum of embedded starburst regions. Consequently, this depletion of the UIB carriers\nwill be further enhanced relative to the observed relative increase of the MIR continuum in starburst regions (see spectrum of Knot A in the Antennae Galaxies, Mirabel et al. 1998). Therefore, the LW3(12-18 \u03bcm) to\nLW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm) flux ratio increases in strong starburst environments. One should note that the overall MIR spectral\nshape can be also considerably affected by the high extinction often found in starburst regions. In particular the\nsilicate band centered at 9.7 \u03bcm can suppress the strength\nof UIBs at 11.3, 8.6 and 6.2 \u03bcm relative to that at 7.7\u03bcm\n(Lutz et al. 1998, Rigopoulou et al. 1999) as seen in the\nspectrum of Arp 220 (Charmandaris et al. 1999).\n3.3. MIR emission of AGNs.\nSeveral studies have already shown that MIR\nspectra\nin\nAGNs\nalso\npresent\nweak\nUIBs\n(Roche et al. 1991, Genzel et al. 1998, Schulz et al. 1998,\nRigopoulou et al. 1999, Dudley 1999). This effect is\ndemonstrated in the spectrum of the nearest AGN of our\nsample located in the radio galaxy Centaurus A (CenA,\nNGC 5128, Mirabel et al. 1999).\nIn the MIR observations of CenA, we have sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle the emission of\nthe central regions near the AGN from that due to\nstar forming regions of the galactic disk. The absence\nof UIBs in the central 5 arcsec (\u223c 100 pc) possibly indicates the destruction of their carriers by the intense UVX-ray radiation field from the AGN (L\u00e9ger et al. 1989,\nAllain et al. 1996). Moreover, there is a noticeable continuum at short wavelengths (3-10 \u03bcm) commonly attributed to hot dust, associated with the torus of molecular gas proposed in the unified model (Pier & Krolik 1992,\nGranato et al. 1997, Murayama et al. 2000). The alternative interpretation of supernova remnants (SNRs) as the\nphysical mechanism explaining the AGN phenomenon\n(Terlevich et al. 1992) is not supported by the MIR observations. Nearby SNRs, such as Cassiopeia A, Kepler, the\nCrab, RCW 103 and IC443 are all characterized by strong\nionic and/or molecular line emission and a faint continuum\n(Douvion et al. 1999, Oliva et al. 1999). These characteristic features are not found in our integrated MIR spectra of galactic nuclei which are known to harbor AGNs.\nThe MIR spectrum of AGNs is flatter compared to that\nof pure HII regions (see the AGN and HII spectra in\nFigure 5). This is in agreement with IRAS observations\nwhere infrared spectra from active galaxies are generaly\nsignificantly flatter with the peak of emission shifted towards the MIR (de Grijp et al. 1985). Near an AGN the\n\n5\n\nradiation field can heat dust up to evaporation temperatures of \u223c 1000K for silicate and \u223c 1500K for graphite.\nAs a result, the dust continuum emission becomes prominent at short wavelengths (3-6 \u03bcm) in contrast to emission\nfrom star forming regions which appears at longer wavelengths (e.g. Barvainis 1987). Such a continuum is found\nin the center of all galaxies in our sample known to be\nhosting an AGN such as NGC 1068, NGC 6814 or NGC\n3147 (Laurent et al. 1997). Highly ionized species tracing\nthe hard radiation field of the AGN (e.g. [NeV]14.3 \u03bcm\nand [NeVI]7.6 \u03bcm) are detected in NGC 1068. However,\ndue to the low spectral resolution of ISOCAM spectra\n(\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 40), the [NeV] and [NeVI], if they exist, are\nblended with the nearby UIBs in all of our galaxies (see\nalso Sturm et al. 2000).\n4. MIR diagnostics to distinguish AGNs,\nstarburst and quiescent star forming regions.\nOur diagnostics are based on the assumption that the integrated MIR emission in galaxies can be represented by\na sum of contributions originating from (1) regions where\nthe dust is predominantly heated by an AGN and (2) regions where star formation is the main source of energy. As\nmentionned in sections 3.1 and 3.2, star forming regions\ncan also be divided in two classes: relatively quiescent regions where most of the MIR emission originates from the\nPDRs, and starburst-like regions where continuum emission at 15 \u03bcm produced in the HII regions is dominant. We\ntherefore propose to categorize the spectra from our sample using empirical criteria chosen to separate the distinct\nUIB and MIR continuum behaviours. To further examine the relative proportion of each contribution, we also\ncompare our spectra with three templates, namely, AGNs,\npure HII regions and isolated PDRs. The relative proportions of these templates required to reproduce a given MIR\nspectrum allow us to classify the observed region as MIR\nspectral type dominated by AGN, starburst or relatively\nquiescent regions.\n4.1. MIR templates\nTo construct the templates of each component, we selected\nthree ISOCAM CVF spectra dominated by each of these\nphysical processes. These template spectra are presented\nin Figure 5a.\nThe strong continuum at 14-15 \u03bcm observed in starburst galaxies was modeled by a typical pure HII Galactic region spectrum from M17 (Cesarsky et al. 1996b).\nUIBs are absent or faint (upper panel of Figure 5a) and\nthe [ArIII](8.9 \u03bcm), [SIV](10.5 \u03bcm), [NeII](12.8 \u03bcm) and\n[NeIII](15.6 \u03bcm) are present. A typical starburst spectrum\ncan be usually decomposed using the VSG continuum\nwith some UIB emission (Tran 1998). Since UIBs originate mainly from PDRs or diffuse regions, we used as their\ntemplate, an isolated PDR spectrum from the galactic re-\n\n\f6\n\nLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nflection nebula NGC 7023 (Cesarsky et al. 1996a) (see the\nlower right part of the Figure 5a).\nThe AGN component was characterised by the MIR\nspectrum of the central region of CenA (see Fig. 3 and\nthe lower left part of the Figure 5a), in which UIBs are\nabsent as in the HII region template. However, in contrast to the HII region template spectrum, the continuum\nat short wavelengths (5-10 \u03bcm) is prominent in the AGN\nspectrum. In addition, the equivalent width of emission\nlines of [NeII] and [NeIII] is small, perhaps due to the\noverwhelming continuum contribution. Note that extinction affects the AGN template and is greater in Cen A\nthan in NGC 1068 (see Fig. 10).\n4.2. MIR indicators: [HII]/[AGN] and [PDR]/[AGN,HII]\nAs each MIR template has distinct characteristics, we can\nquantify their relative contribution to the integrated spectrum. We have used two indicators based on the UIB\nstrength and the MIR continuum. As an indicator of the\nrelative HII region and AGN contribution, we use the ratio of \"warm\" (14-15 \u03bcm) to \"hot\" (5.1-6.8 \u03bcm) continuum\n(Fig. 4). As this ratio decreases, the presence of an AGN\nbecomes more evident due to the increase of the relative\nimportance of the \"hot\" continuum. The UIB(6.2 \u03bcm) to\ncontinuum (5.1-6.8 \u03bcm) flux ratio can be used to identify the relative contributions of the quiescent star forming regions to the starburst and/or AGN MIR emission.\nThis indicator is very similar to the one proposed by Genzel which is based on the strength of the 7.7 \u03bcm feature\n(Genzel et al. 1998, Lutz et al. 1998). Our estimate of the\nUIB flux has the advantage to be less affected by the\nstrong silicate extinction at 9-11 \u03bcm while the continuum\nat 5-7 \u03bcm is also less contaminated by the VSG continuum. The effect of a strong absorption on the AGN continuum could artificially enhance the presence of a UIB\nat 7.7 \u03bcm but not at 6.2 \u03bcm. Nevertheless, the choice of\nthe 6.2 \u03bcm which is weaker than the 7.7 \u03bcm feature necessitates spectra with good signal to noise ratio. This\nis the case in our sample of spectra where the UIB at\n6.2 \u03bcm is very well detected (Figures 3 and 7 or the spectra in the Antennae in Mirabel et al. 1998, for some examples). Since our primary goal is to establish the absence\nof UIBs as well as the presence of a well detected AGN\ncontinuum, at short MIR wavelengths, a criterion based\non the UIB(5.9-6.8 \u03bcm)/Continuum(5.1-6.8 \u03bcm) ratio applied on high signal to noise spectra gives a more accurate\ndiagnostic for revealing the presence of an AGN. As we\nshow in the following sections, the relative variation of\nour UIB/Continuum at 6 \u03bcm is reliable in separating a\nfeatureless continuum from UIB spectra even if our 6 \u03bcm\ncontinuum measurements may still be slightly affected by\nemission coming from the wing of the 7.7 \u03bcm UIB (see Fig.\n4).\n\n4.3. Diagnostic diagram\nHaving defined the three MIR templates, we construct a\ncomplete library of composite spectra where the contribution of each template can vary between 0 and 100 %. On\nthese composite spectra, we can measure the diagnostic\nratios presented above and plot them on a 2-dimensional\ndiagram (see Fig. 5). Three main regions can be identified in the corners of this diagram where the signatures of\nAGNs, starbursts, or quiescent star forming regions dominate the total spectrum.\nThe above diagram can be applied only in the galaxies where MIR spectra are available. However, one may\nexpand it to cases where only broad band MIR images\nare available. This can be done by using our library of\nspectra to estimate their corresponding fluxes through\nthe ISOCAM filters that isolate as closely as possible the\nregions identified in Figure 4. The filters used are the\nLW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm), LW3(12-18 \u03bcm) and LW4(5.5-6.5 \u03bcm). As\nwe will show in the following sections the broad band diagnostic gives results comparable to those obtained with\nthe CVFs. The equivalent fluxes of our CVF templates\nthrough the three broad band filters are presented in Figure 5b. Using the same reasoning as in Figure 5a, we\nestimate the relative strength of UIBs with the LW2(58.5 \u03bcm)/LW4(5.5-6.5 \u03bcm) flux ratio while the ratio of the\nLW3(12-18 \u03bcm)/LW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm) emission provides an estimate of the VSG contribution relative to the UIB and/or\nhot dust emission at short wavelengths. Those two diagnostic diagrams have in common the capacity to separate\nindividualy regions dominated by AGN, starburst or quiescent star forming regions. The robustness of the two criteria against observed MIR spectra of galaxies is examined\nin the following section.\n4.4. Application of the diagnostic\nOur MIR indicators were applied to the galaxies of\nour sample (see Table 1), in which we also included a\nfew irregular galaxies such as the blue compact dwarf\ngalaxies IIZw40 and NGC 1569 (Madden et al. 1999)\nand barred spiral galaxies NGC 1097 and NGC 1365\n(Roussel et al. 1999a) in order to cover the diagram completely. In cases where we had adequate spatial resolution, we extracted different physical regions in the same\ngalaxy. The results are presented in Figure 6. Galaxies\ncommonly classified as starbursts, such as Arp 220 and\nArp 299(A), fall toward the top part of the diagram implying the presence of a large fraction of starburst regions\ncompared to quiescent star forming regions. A few nearby\ngalaxies with known AGNs are located in the bottom left\npart of the diagram along with our AGN template, the\nnucleus of Cen A. Regions of moderate star formation observed in galactic disks are situated in the region of the\ndiagram where we expect to find a dominant PDR contribution. In Figure 7, we present three typical spectra from\n\n\fLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\n7\n\nFig. 5. a) Diagnostic diagram based on CVF spectra. b) Diagnostic diagram based on broad band filters. Three distinct\nareas can be defined. In the upper corner, we select spectra dominated by massive HII regions such as those found in\nstarbursts. On the lower left, AGN spectra are dominant in a very small region, and finally, PDR spectra fall in the\nlower right part. The solid lines and the associated percentages indicate a constant fraction of one component along\neach line (see section 4.3).\nour sample dominated by UIBs (the disk of M82), an HII\ncontinuum (the nucleus of M82) as well as an AGN (the\nnucleus of NGC 1068). Based on their position on our diagnostic diagram in Figure 6, we estimate the corresponding fraction of MIR templates according to the Figure 5a.\nThis is a first order approximation since we do not take\nexplicitly into account the effects of the 9.7 \u03bcm silicate\nabsorption band on our template spectra. Consequently,\nthe observed difference between model and spectra in the\nrange of 9 to 11 \u03bcm is probably due to the strong silicate\nextinction in embedded starbursts or AGNs. We do not\nattempt to model the emission from the [NeII](12.8 \u03bcm)\nand [NeIII](15.6 \u03bcm) lines which are independant of the\ndust emission properties. Nevertheless, the overall agreement presented in Figure 7 is sufficient for modeling the\ngeneral shape of spectra.\nTo extend our diagnostics in the case where spectra\nare not available, we present in Figure 8 the diagnos-\n\ntic diagram using broad band filters2 . As expected, the\nAGN candidates appear in the left part of this diagram.\nFor LW3/LW2 ratios close to 1, PDRs dominate the MIR\nemission in our sample as it was the case for normal spiral galaxies (Boselli et al. 1997, Roussel et al. 1999a). For\nLW3/LW2 ratios between 1 and 6, both an AGN and a\nstar forming region signature may appear in our spectra\n(e.g. the nucleus of NGC 253 and NGC 1068 in Fig. 8).\nWe note, however, that the LW2/LW4 flux ratio is well\nadapted to estimate the presence of an AGN contribution. For LW2/LW4 ratios lower than 1.5, we clearly see\nthat the MIR emission is dominated by the AGN whose\nstrong continuum and nearly absent UIBs, contribute to\n2\n\nFor galaxies of our sample for which we had only CVF\nspectra, we calculated the equivalent broad band filter fluxes\ntaking into account their filter transmission. Note that since\nthe CVF ends at 16 \u03bcm to match its equivalent LW3 filter to the\nISOCAM standard LW3(12-18 \u03bcm) filter, we have normalized\nthe transmission of the latter between 12 and 16 \u03bcm.\n\n\f8\n\nLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nHII\n\nIIZW40\nArp 299 (A)\n\nArp 220\n\nNGC 1569\n\nNGC 4038/39 (Hot spot)\nArp 299 (C')\nArp 299 (C)\n\nNGC 3256 (Disk)\nNGC 253 (Nucleus)\nM82 (Nucleus)NGC 3256 (Nucleus)\nArp 299 (B) NGC 6240\nNGC 253 (Disk)\nIRAS 23128-5919\nNGC 1808 (Disk)\nNGC 1068 (Nucleus)\n\nArp 236 (Nucleus)\n\nCENA (Disk)\nM83 (Nucleus)\nNGC\n1808\n(Nucleus)\nNGC 613 (Nucleus)\nArp 118 (Nucleus)\nNGC 520\nM82 (Disk)\nCENA (Nucleus)\nNGC 1068 (Disk)\nNGC 1365 (Nucleus)\nM83 (Disk)\nM51 (Nucleus)\nM51 (Disk)\nNGC 1097 (Nucleus) NGC 1097 (Disk)\n\nAGN\n\nNUCLEUS WITH AGN\nSTARBURST REGION\nQUIESCENT STAR FORMING REGION\n\nPDR\n\nFig. 6.

For larger LW2/LW4 ratios, emission\nis dominated either by quiescent star forming regions or\nby starburst regions (see Fig. 8). Applying this criterion\nto the nucleus of M82, we clearly see that it is classified\nas a starburst while the nucleus of NGC 1068 has a typical AGN signature. Athough this diagram uses only three\nbroad band filters, the MIR classification is in good agreement with results given by the diagnostic diagram based\non full spectra (see Table 1).\nMoreover, the diagnostic diagrams of Figures 6 and\n8 suggest that the well-known ultra-luminous galaxies\nsuch as IRAS 23128-5919 and NGC 6240 have MIR spectra which are overwhelmed by a strong starburst signature. In the \"Super Antennae\" (IRAS 19254-7245), which\n\nharbors a Seyfert 2 nucleus (Mirabel et al. 1991), more\nthan \u223c70% of its MIR flux originates from the AGN\n(Laurent et al. 2000b).\nOne can also use this technique to discover up to\nnow unclassified AGN hidden by a large column density of dust. Such a candidate is Arp 236 (IC 1623,\nVV 114), an infrared luminous system (LIR = 1011.62\nL\u2299 ), classified as an early-stage gas-rich merger (M(H2 )\n= 5.1\u00d71010 M\u2299 , Yun et al. 1994), and composed of several nuclei and/or compact starburst regions. Previous near-infrared and radio studies showed no evidence\nfor an AGN (Knop et al. 1994, Doyon et al. 1995). However, the MIR signatures of the eastern region (knot A,\nDoyon et al. 1995) place it near the AGN locus in our\n\n\fLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nQuiescent star forming region\n\nAGN\n\nStarburst region\n\nM 82 (Disk)\n\n9\n\nM 82 (Nucleus)\n\nNGC 1068 (Nucleus)\n\nFig. 7.

Nevertheless, one should note that the possible\nAGN contribution in Arp 236 is not revealed with the LW\ndiagnostic (Fig. 8) which is less accurate compared to the\nCVF diagnostic. Knot A is the brightest source in the\nnear-infrared. It is also redder and more compact than all\nother sources in the system (not resolved at 3.7 \u03bcm with a\nFWHM of 0.3 arcsec, Knop et al. 1994). We estimate that\n\u223c 40 % of the MIR emission in the region can originate\nfrom an optically obscured AGN. A MIR spectral classification based on our method is presented in the last column\nof Table 1 for all of our sample.\n5. Discussion\nOur diagnostic diagrams provide a new tool allowing us\nto identify an AGN or star formation (starburst and/or\nquiescent star forming regions) signature in the integrated\nMIR spectrum of a galaxy.\nAlthough self consistent, our method is based on data\nfrom a rather diverse sample. To further test its validity,\nwe compared it with the MIR diagnostics developed by\nGenzel et al. (1998a) on a complete sample of ULIRGs,\nusing ISOPHOT-S. Using the published MIR spectra of\nthe brightest sources in the Genzel sample, we calculated the strength of the UIB at 6.2 \u03bcm in these spectra,\nas well as the equivalent LW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm)/LW4(5.5-6.5 \u03bcm)\nratio since this is the principal discriminator between an\nAGN and star forming regions (see Fig. 9). The classification of galaxies obtained based on our method is in complete agreement with that of Genzel et al. (1998a). IRAS\n23060+0505, IRAS 19254-7245, Mrk 231 and Mrk 273,\nwith an LW2/LW4 ratio of 1.16, 1.36, 1.42 and 1.60 respectively, are classified by both methods as galaxies containing a significant AGN contribution in the MIR. Furthermore, in the wavelength range of ISOCAM (5-16 \u03bcm),\nwe can better constrain the nature of the continuum at\n\n7 \u03bcm between dust and stellar contribution using the 1415 \u03bcm flux, since the LW3(12-18 \u03bcm)/LW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm) flux\nratio is greater than 3 for the dust continuum found in\nAGNs or HII regions and less than 0.4 for the stellar continuum (Boselli et al. (1997). We are also able to distinguish whether a featureless continuum is due to an AGN\nor a pure HII region (e.g. IIZw40).\nSelective absorption by amorphous silicates, centered\nat 9.7 and 18 \u03bcm, can play a crucial role in obscuring emission over much of the MIR wavelengths. AGNs\nembedded in a large amount of dust could still remain\nundetected by our diagnostic. Studying a sample of 28\nSeyfert 1 and 29 Seyfert 2 with ISOPHOT-S, Schulz et\nal. (1998) have already shown that the high absorption\nin Seyfert 2 galaxies blocks a large fraction (90% on\nthe average) of the MIR continuum from the AGN inner torus. They do detect the silicate feature in emission at 9.7 \u03bcm which is in favour of a moderately thick\ntorus model (AV \u223c100, Granato et al. 1997) and rules\nout models with very large optical depths (AV \u223c1000,\nPier & Krolik 1992). In our sample, among all nuclei (diameter < 9\u2032\u2032 ) which are classified as AGNs based on our\nMIR diagnostics (see Fig. 8), five nuclei are optically selected as Seyfert 2. Provided sufficient spatial resolution\nis available, we can detect the hot dust continuum associated with the AGN and we are able to disentangle its\ncontribution to the MIR emission of the galaxy. If those\nnuclei were observed with the ISOPHOT-S aperture of\n24\u00d724 arcsec2, we would detect the presence of an AGN\nonly in the two nearest Seyfert 2 of our sample NGC 1068,\nCenA and in NGC 6814 which is a Seyfert 1. The dilution effect combined with the optical depth of the AGN\ntorus would lead to an underestimation of the number\nof detected AGNs. The MIR continuum associated with\nAGNs is not completely suppressed behind the dusty torus\nand may be observed using sufficient spatial resolution\n(\u223c5 arcsec) observations on nearby galaxies (D< 50 Mpc\n\n\f10\n\nLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nHII\nNGC 1569\nIIZW40\n\nArp 299 (A)\n\nNGC 4038/39 (Hot spot)\nArp 220\nArp 299 (B)\n\nArp 299 (C)\nIRAS 20551-4250\nNGC 253 (Nucleus)\nIRAS 23128-5919\nCENA (Nucleus)\nNGC 6240\nArp 299 (C')\nArp 118 (Nucleus)\nNGC 3147 (Nucleus)\nNGC\n3256 (Nucleus)\nIRAS 19254-7245\nM82 (Nucleus)\nNGC 6814 (Nucleus)\nNGC 253 (Disk)\nNGC 3256 (Disk)\nNGC 613 (Nucleus)\nNGC 1365 (Nucleus)\nIRAS 17208-0014\nM83 (Nucleus)\nNGC 1808 (Disk)\nM51 (Nucleus)\nArp 236 (Nucleus)\nCENA (Disk)\nNGC 1808 (Nucleus)\nNGC 1097 (Nucleus)\nM83 (Disk)\nNGC 7252\nNGC 3147\nNGC 3263 (Nucleus)\nNGC 1068 (Disk)\nNGC 520\nNGC 1097 (Disk)\nNGC 6814\nM51 (Disk)\nM82 (Disk)\n\nAGN\n\nNGC 1068 (Nucleus)\n\nNGC 4676 (A)\n\nNGC 4676 (B)\n\nNUCLEUS WITH AGN\nSTARBURST REGION\n\nPDR\n\nQUIESCENT STAR FORMING REGION\n\nFig. 8. Diagram based on broad band diagnostics for 45 spectra using the notation of Table 1. The error bars are\nestimated from the rms map at 1 \u03c3 for CVF spectra or broad band observations added to a systematic error of 10%\ndue to the transient correction method. Note that several spiral and blue compact dwarf galaxies not listed in the\nTable 1 are from other samples (Roussel et al. 1999a, Madden et al. 1999). The galactic central regions (size of several\nkpc) hosting an AGN are all located in the left part of the diagram (marked with circles). The galaxies dominated by\na starburst activity are in the upper part due to their higher LW3/LW2 ratio (marked with diamonds). The spectra\nof quiescent star forming regions lie close to the PDR area (marked with squares). The curves demarcate the AGN,\nPDR and HII spectral type according to Figure 5b.\nwith H0 =75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , see Laurent et al. 1999b). The\ndetection of the AGN continuum in Seyfert 2 is also in better agreement with a dusty torus model producing moderate absorption (AV \u223c100) as in the model of Granato et\nal. (1997).\nIn Figure 10, we note that the increase of the absorption in an AGN spectrum leads to a decrease of the hot\ncontinuum used in our diagnostic. This further suggests\nthat the \"true\" AGN fraction would be underestimated\nand our detections must be considered as a lower limit.\nAn intrinsically low AGN contribution to the MIR spectrum of a source would be difficult to distinguish from the\nstar forming emission at 6-7 \u03bcm composed by UIBs and\nthe VSG continuum. Consequently, we consider that an\n\nAGN is detected by our diagnostic when the estimated\nfraction of the AGN emission is larger than the contribution of starburst or quiescent star forming regions.\nRecently several studies on the origin of the MIR emission in galaxy clusters and deep field surveys were performed with ISOCAM using the LW3 and LW2 broad\nband filters (e.g. Aussel et al. 1999, D\u00e9sert et al. 1999,\nFlores et al. 1999). Our diagnostic implies that one cannot\ndiscriminate between an AGN and a starburst signature\nusing just those two filters in the local universe (see Fig. 9).\nAt high redshifts, the two filter bandpasses sample shorter\nrest frame wavelength emission and are less sensitive to\nthe VSG continuum. In Figure 11, we applied a redshift\ncorrection on our MIR templates at z=0.2 and z=0.4, and\n\n\fLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\n11\n\nFig. 9. a)In the above figure we display the variation of the AGN-Starburst fraction (indicated in the y-axis) as\na function of LW3(12-18 \u03bcm)/LW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm) flux ratio based on the three templates of our diagnostic for galaxies\nof the local universe. We divide our library of composite spectra (see Fig. 5) into one component attributed to star\nformation activity (including both the PDR/diffuse and HII region templates) and a second one to AGN. For a given\nLW3/LW2 ratio and a selected type of star fomation mixture (as indictated by the solid curves of different PDR and\nHII fractions) one can calculate the percentage of the AGN component in the spectrum. b) Same as in a) but for the\nLW2(5-8.5 \u03bcm)/LW4(5.5-6.5 \u03bcm) flux ratio. Note how the use of just the LW3/LW2 ratio is insufficient for detecting\nAGNs. This is not the case for the LW2/LW4 ratio which is relevant to select AGNs from starbursts (see section 4.4).\nwe obtained the equivalent diagnostic diagrams derived\nfrom observations of nearby galaxies. To extrapolate the\npart of the spectrum under 5 \u03bcm, we use a power law for\nthe AGN template and a black-body continuum for the\npure HII region template. We also assume that the PDR\ncomponent under 5 \u03bcm is negligible (Lu et al. 1999). At\nz=0.4, objects with LW3/LW2<3 are classified as AGNdominant in the MIR. For redshifts between 0.5 and 1,\nthe LW3 filter samples mainly UIBs (LW2 at z=0), while\nLW2 probes the hot dust emission between 3 and 5 \u03bcm\n(assuming that the stellar emission is negligible in spiral\ngalaxies and only begins to be substantial below 2 \u03bcm).\nConsequently, low values of the LW3/LW2 flux ratios in\nthese surveys would suggest the presence of an AGN.\nIn our diagnostic method, we have implicitly considered that the MIR emission from the evolved stellar population is negligible in spiral galaxies. Even though this\nmay be true for galactic disks (Roussel et al. 1999a), extra caution is needed for bulges in the center of which\none finds the AGN. In that case, it is the rising slope of\nthe MIR spectrum which would reveal the presence of an\nAGN, even though we cannot rule out completely a possible faint contamination from evolved starlight at short\nwavelengths. Moreover, the fact that the core radius of the\nbulge is several orders of magnitude larger than the region\nresponsible for the \"hot continuum\" would in principle facilitate their separation in nearby galaxies. For distant\ngalaxies where the integrated MIR spectra include the\nwhole galactic bulge, it is very difficult to estimate the\n\nform of the continuum below 6 \u03bcm. M83, a well known\nstarburst galaxy, is such an example, since we detect considerable continuum emission at 5-6 \u03bcm (see Fig. 8). This\nemission is clearly extended outside the unresolved nuclear\nregion and can be interpreted as stellar emission from the\nstellar bar (cf. Elmegreen et al. 1998 and Sauvage priv.\ncomm.)3 . Furthermore, for distant galaxies the contribution of the star forming regions surrounding an AGN\nwould progressively enter in the beam and dilute the AGN\nMIR signatures. A more detailed discussion on this issue\nis presented in Laurent et al. 1999b.\nOur diagnostic method can be further expanded with\nthe improved performance of upcoming telescopes, and\ncan be used as a guide in scheduling future research programs. In addition to an increase in sensitivity, SIRTF will\nprovide better wavelength coverage (5-40 \u03bcm) than ISOCAM, and better spatial resolution than the ISO-SWS\nobservations. In particular, SIRTF would provide a better\nmeasurement of the continuum for distant faint sources\nand, calculating the depth of both silicate absorption\nbands at 9.7 and 18 \u03bcm, a more precise estimate for the absorption. An increase in spatial resolution would also permit a significant improvement in the AGN/Starburst diag3\n\nTo further develop our diagnostic for general cases including evolved stellar population, the K band flux at 2.2 \u03bcm could\nbe used to estimate the contribution of the stellar emission observed at short MIR wavelengths. A LW2/K or LW3/K flux\nratio less than 1 would indicate a more important contribution\nfrom the stellar component.\n\n\f12\n\nLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nFig. 11.

We use the same notation as in Figure 9 for the contribution of the star\nformation component. The percentages indicate the fraction of each contribution in the rest-frame wavelengths. The\nLW3/LW2 ratio which is degenerate for distinguishing AGNs from starbursts at low redshifts can be used for detecting\nthe AGN continuum at higher redshifts (i.e. z\u223c0.4) due to the K-correction effect on MIR spectra (see section 5).\nnostics. Both the infrared instruments installed on ground\nbased 10 meter telescopes and the Next Generation Space\nTelescope which will cover the MIR spectrum, will probe\nregions of \u223c10 pcs near the AGNs, decreasing significantly\nthe effects of beam dilution.\n6. Conclusions\nUsing our ISOCAM MIR observations we have obtained a\nnew AGN/Starburst diagnostic based on the strength of\nthe UIBs at 6.2 \u03bcm and the MIR continuum. We conclude\nthat:\n1) In AGN spectra (even with a faint starburst contamination), a strong MIR continuum is present at short\nwavelengths between 3-10 \u03bcm. This continuum may be attributed to very hot dust grains directly heated by the\ncentral engine. Furthermore, the absence of UIBs suggests\nthat their carriers can be destroyed by the strong UV-X\nray radiation field.\n2) Our MIR diagnostic diagrams can be used to unravel AGNs that are completely obscured at optical wavelengths. For example, the nucleus of Arp 236 which was\nclassified as a starburst galaxy triggered by an interaction\nis likely to contain an AGN that contributes \u223c 40% to the\nMIR flux.\n3) The emission from ultraluminous infrared galaxies\ncan be dominated either by a starburst (e.g. Arp 220) or\nan AGN (e.g. The Super Antennae, IRAS 19254-7245).\nNevertheless, an AGN can remain partially hidden by the\ntorus absorption even in the MIR which may lead to an\nunderestimate of its contribution to the whole spectral\nenergy distribution.\n\n4) In the local universe, the LW3(12-18 \u03bcm)/LW2(58.5 \u03bcm) ratio alone cannot be used to distinguish AGNs\nfrom starbursts. However, for galaxies at z=0.4-1, this ratio is effective in discriminating the AGN from the starburst contribution.\n5) Applications of adapted versions of our diagnostic\nin future instruments such as SIRTF and NGST, which\nwill sample the MIR band with higher spatial resolution\nand sensitivity than ISOCAM, should provide better insights into the heating sources of the interstellar medium\nin galaxies.\nAcknowledgements.

Upper left panel : A 7 \u03bcm map of the dust emission\nin Cen A (from Mirabel et al. 1999). Upper right panel :\nThe central region of Cen A as seen in the band 7-8.5 \u03bcm\nwhich traces the most intense UIB emission at 7.7 \u03bcm. Due\nto a good spatial resolution at 7 \u03bcm (FWHM = 5 arcsec,\ni.e. 100 pc at 3.5 Mpc), we can separate the nuclear region\nfrom the disk. Middle panel : The lower curve represents\nthe MIR spectrum originating only from the nuclear region\n(100 pc in diameter) whereas the upper curve shows the\nspectrum integrated over a larger region (800 pc in diameter) which includes both disk structures and the nucleus.\nThe silicate absorption cannot be well estimated from the\nglobal spectrum but is clearly detected in the AGN continuum. Lower panel : The AGN spectrum (left) represents\n45 % of the energy between 5 and 16 \u03bcm and it contributes\nmore than 90 % at wavelengths between 3 and 6 \u03bcm. No\nemission associated with star forming regions is detected\nbetween 3-4 \u03bcm (lower right panel, ISOCAM SW channel). While UIBs dominate the MIR emission of the disk,\nthey are almost absent in a region of 50 pc radius around\nthe AGN. The higher [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio detected in the\nAGN (lower left panel) further indicates the presence of a\nhard radiation field.\n\n\fLaurent et al.: Mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish AGNs from starbursts\n\nNGC 1068\n\nCENTAURUS A\n\n\u03b1 = 1.7\n\nSTAR FORMING REGION + AGN\n\n\u03b1 = 1.4\n\nAv = 7\n\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n11111\n00000\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nAGN\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nFig. 4. The relative strength of the UIB(6.2 \u03bcm) feature\nis estimated by dividing the spectrum between 5.1 and\n6.8 \u03bcm in two different parts. One is the integrated flux\nabove the line between 5.9 and 6.8 \u03bcm which is attributed\nto the UIB at 6.2 \u03bcm and traces essentially the PDRs in\nthe star forming regions. The second is the integrated flux\nunder the line which is mainly attributed to the AGN continuum and/or wing of the UIB at 7.7 \u03bcm. The feature to\ncontinuum indicator is used to estimate the relative contributions to the heating of the dust from quiescent star\nforming regions compared to the one from an AGN. We\nmeasure the \"hot continuum\" (5.1-6.8 \u03bcm) which may contain an AGN contribution and compare it to the \"warm\ncontinuum\" (14-15 \u03bcm) produced by both star forming regions and AGNs. As a consequence, the warm to hot continuum ratio can be used to quantify the relative contribution of a starburst continuum and an AGN in the MIR.\n\n15\n\nAv = 20\n\nAv\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n\nFig. 10. The effects of absorption on AGN spectra characterised by a strong continuum at short wavelength associated with an absence of UIBs. In small panels, we display\nthe nuclear spectra of NGC 1068 and CenA as well as a\nbest fit based on a simple screen model (with the dust absorption law of Dudley & Wynn-Williams 1997) applied\nto a power law of spectral index \u03b1. The corresponding\nvisible absorptions for the fits are 7 and 20 mag respectively. The large diagram presents how the same power law\nspectrum (\u03b1=1.7) affected when absorption ranges from\nAV =0 to 100.\n\n\f"}
