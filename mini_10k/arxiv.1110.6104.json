The aim is to elucidate how the\npresence of noble gas atoms affects the electronic transport through metallic atomic-size contacts.\nOur analysis, based on density functional theory and including van der Waals interactions, shows\nthat for the lightest elements (He and Ne) no significant current flows through the noble gas atoms\nand their effect is to reduce the conductance of the junctions by screening the interaction between\nthe gold electrodes. This explains the observations reported in metallic atomic-size contacts with\nadsorbed He atoms. Conversely, the heaviest atoms (Kr and Xe) increase the conductance due to\nthe additional current path provided by their valence p states.\nPACS numbers: 73.63.Rt, 73.40.Jn, 73.40.Gk\n\nNoble gases are commonly employed in scanning probe\nexperiments as exchange gases since they are expected to\ninteract weakly with the studied systems. Furthermore,\nit is often assumed that the adsorption of NG atoms\ndoes not affect the electron tunneling between metallic electrodes. However, it has been shown that this is\nnot entirely true. For instance, two decades ago Eigler\nand coworkers presented scanning tunneling microscope\n(STM) images of Xe atoms on a Ni(110) surface1 and\nthey nicely demonstrated that these atoms can be moved\nto chosen positions on the surface. It has also been shown\nthat it is possible to manipulate individual Xe atoms to\nconstruct atomic wires and to measure their electrical\nresistance2 or to functionalize molecules.3\nFrom the theory side, while there are numerous works\nanalyzing the interaction between noble gas (NG) atoms\nand metal surfaces, studies exploring the transport\nthrough metal-NG-metal junctions are rather scarce,\nand most of them have focused either on understanding atomic manipulation or on STM imaging.2,4\u20138 There\nare still important open problems concerning how adsorbed NG atoms modify the transport through metallic\natomic-size junctions. A striking example is the observation made in several break-junction and STM experiments that adsorbed He atoms can strongly modify the\ncurrent through metallic junctions, lowering in particular the low-bias conductance.9\u201312 This conductance suppression is surprising since the height of the tunneling\nbarrier in the presence of NG atoms has been predicted\nto decrease5 and, indeed, Kelvin probe experiments have\nshown that the work function of noble metal surfaces decreases upon adsorption of Ar, Kr and Xe.13 A possible\nexplanation, based on predictions by Lang,4 suggests that\nadsorbed He atoms can polarize metal states away from\nthe Fermi energy, leading to a decrease in the metal local\ndensity of states. This explanation was based on cal-\n\nculations where the metal electrodes were described by\na jellium model (with no atomistic details) and without\ntaking into account van der Waals interactions. Thus, it\nis highly desirable to revisit this problem with ab initio\ntransport methods.\nTo shed new light on the influence of adsorbed NG\natoms in the transport through metallic atomic contacts,\nwe present in this Brief Report a systematic ab initio\nstudy of the conductance of gold atomic junctions containing single atoms of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. Our\ncalculations, based on density functional theory (DFT),\nshow that, while for He and Ne the current flows directly\nfrom one metallic electrode to the other, for Ar, Kr and\nXe the transport occurs mainly through the valence p\nstates of the NG atom. In all cases, the presence of NG\natoms induces a dipole moment which screens the interaction between the leads. In the case of He, Ne, and Ar\nthe weakening of the metal-metal coupling (rather than\na suppression of the metal density of states, as proposed\nby Lang4 ) leads to a reduction of the tunneling current.\nOn the contrary, for Kr and Xe the additional tunneling path provided by the valence p states overcomes the\nscreening, leading to an enhancement of the current.\nOur main goal is to analyze the electronic transport\nthrough metallic atomic-size contacts containing single\natoms of noble gases. In particular, we have chosen gold\nfor the electrode material and studied the elements He,\nNe, Ar, Kr, and Xe. For this purpose, we have carried\nout conductance calculations within the framework of\nDFT following the method described in Ref. [14], which\nis built upon the Turbomole 6.1 code.15 In all our calculations we have used the BP86 functional.16 The first step\nin our analysis is the construction of the atomic junctions. This is done by optimizing geometries where the\ngold electrodes are formed by two finite clusters of 20\natoms and a single NG atom is placed in the middle.

The vertical dashed lines indicate the\ngold Fermi level (-5 eV). (f) Comparison of conductances for\nAu-Au and Au-NG-Au junctions for all studied NG atoms.\n\nthe optimization, the NG atom and the four innermost\ngold atoms on each side were relaxed, while the other\ngold atoms were kept frozen. For the optimized atoms, a\ndef2-TZVP basis set17 was chosen, while a def-SVP basis\nset18 was used for the frozen gold atoms. The binding\nenergies calculated in this way were found to differ by\nonly around 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV from those calculated with a\ndef2-TZVP basis set for all the atoms. Subsequently, the\ngold cluster size was extended to 116 atoms on each side\nin order to describe the metal-NG atom charge transfer and the energy level alignment correctly (see inset\nin Fig. 1). It is important to emphasize that we have\nused the semiempirical DFT-D2 correction19 in order to\ntake the dispersive forces into account, since the binding distance between NG and noble metals is known to\nbe determined by the interplay between the Pauli repulsion and the van der Waals interaction.20,21 Finally, the\ninformation about the electronic structure of the junctions obtained with DFT is transformed into linear conductance using Green's function techniques as described\nin detail in Ref. [14]. This is done in the spirit of the\nLandauer approach, where the low-temperature\nP linear\nconductance is given by G = G0 T (EF ) = G0 i \u03c4i (EF ),\nwhere G0 = 2e2 /h is the quantum of conductance, T (EF )\nis the total transmission of the junction at the Fermi energy, EF , and {\u03c4i } are the transmission coefficients, i.e.,\nthe eigenvalues of the transmission matrix.\n\nWe now start our analysis of the results by comparing the linear conductance of gold junctions containing\nthe five NG atoms considered in this work. We consider firstly junctions with a top binding position (see\ninset in Fig. 1(f)), since such a geometry has been suggested as the most favorable for most of the NG atoms on\nmetal surfaces.20,22\u201325 The Au-NG-atom distances and\nthe corresponding binding energies are listed in Table I.\nIn particular, the binding energies increase as we move\nto heavier elements, in agreement with the calculations\nof Pershina et al..20 In Fig. 1(a-e) we show the zero-bias\ntransmission as a function of energy for the five Au-NGAu junctions with top binding geometries (dashed lines).\nNotice that below EF (marked by a vertical dashed line),\npronounced peaks appear, which move towards the Fermi\nenergy as the atomic number of the NG atom increases.\nThese peaks appear approximately at the energies of the\nhighest occupied states of the NG atoms in the gas phase\n(see Table I), which suggests that they originate from the\nvalence p states for Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, and from the 1s\nstate for He. A closer look at the peaks for Ne, Ar, Kr,\nand Xe shows that they are split into two. One corresponds to the pz orbital (z being the direction of the\njunction axis), which is shifted to lower energies, and the\nsecond is due to the px and py states, which remain degenerate in the junction.26 The peak or resonance due to\nthe pz orbital is clearly broader due to its stronger hybridization with the gold states. Moreover, the width of\nthis resonance increases from Ne to Xe simply because it\nis determined by the local density of states (LDOS) of the\ngold tip atoms at the energy of the valence states of the\nNG atoms. For Ne and Ar, that energy lies outside the\n5d band of gold, while for Kr and Xe, it is well inside this\nband. Regarding the conductance, displayed in Fig. 1(f),\nit varies in a non-monotonic manner from 10\u22122 G0 for He\nto approximately 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 G0 for Xe. Notice that the\ncomputed conductance for Xe is lower by one order of\nmagnitude than that measured in Ref. [2]. We attribute\nthis to the different electrode material (Au rather than\nNi).\nTo understand the mechanism governing the conduction through the NG atoms and how they modify the\ntransport through the gold junctions, we also present in\nFig. 1(a-e) the transmission curves for Au-Au junctions\n(with no NG atoms) and in panel (f) the corresponding\nconductance. In these calculations we have kept the gold\nelectrodes at the same distance as in the corresponding\nAu-NG-Au junctions. The first thing to notice is that for\nthe lightest elements the conductance is lowered when the\nNG atoms are in the junctions. As explained in the introduction, such a reduction of the conductance caused\nby the adsorption of He has been observed in several lowtemperature break-junction and STM experiments.9,10,12\nA similar behaviour has been observed for closed shell\nmolecules such as H2 .32 For He and Ne, we find that\nthe conductance is decreased by about 30% when these\natoms are present.

The second and third columns show the energy of\nhighest occupied (\u000fh ) and lowest unoccupied (\u000fl ) states for\nthe NG atoms in the gas phase. The others contain calculated quantities for the top-binding geometries with a single\ngold cluster of 116 atoms: binding distance, dipole moment,\ncharge on the NG atom, and binding energy. The value of\nthe dipole in the bare Au cluster is 1.10 debye. Concerning\nthe corresponding quantities in the junction, the binding distances do not change, while the charges on the NG atom and\nthe binding energies are approximately doubled.\n\nconductance, which is larger than a factor of 2 for Xe.\nWhat is the reason for this different behavior? A first\nhint is obtained by comparing the transmission curves of\nthe junctions with and without NG atoms. As one can see\nin Fig. 1(a-b), for He and Ne the transmission curves for\nthe Au-NG-Au junctions follow very closely the energy\ndependence of the Au-Au junctions. This fact suggests\nthat for He and Ne, the main contribution to the current\nin the Au-NG-Au junctions comes from direct tunneling from gold to gold, and the only effect of these NG\natoms is to reduce the transmission of the gold-to-gold\ncurrent path. On the other hand, for Ar, Kr and Xe,\nthe transmission curves differ markedly from those of the\nAu-Au junctions, especially close to the Fermi energy.\nThis suggests that the valence p states of these atoms\nare contributing significantly to the transport through\nthese junctions.\nThe fact that He and Ne do not contribute to the electronic transport is reasonable, as their highest occupied\nstates lie very far away from the Fermi level and they\nare weakly coupled to the electrodes. The conductance\nsuppression is, however, surprising, as it is, a priori, not\nobvious how a closed-shell atom can conduct less than\nthe vacuum. We explain this suppression as follows. In\nour analysis of the interaction between a NG atom and\na single gold cluster we have found that there is a tiny\ncharge transfer (a fraction of an electron leaves the NG\natoms), which induces a dipole moment pointing away\nfrom the metal.27 The values of the charge transfers and\nthe dipole moments are reported in Table I. The existence\nof this dipole moment has been predicted by numerous\nauthors in the context of NG atoms adsorbed on metal\nsurfaces.6,20,25,28\u201330 Also in that context, it has been argued that as a consequence of the induced dipole the\ncharge is pushed from the interstitial vacuum region toward the Au bulk (so-called pillow or cushion effect). In\nour case, we did not find a notable charge depletion on\nthe gold tips. We also did not find any significant change\nin the LDOS of the gold tips at the Fermi level, as was\n\nTransmission Transmission Transmission\n\n3\n10\n-1\n10\n-2\n10\n-3\n10\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n10\n-1\n10\n-2\n10\n-3\n10\n0\n\n10 (c)\n-1\n10\n-2\n10\n-3\n10\n-20\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\nE (eV)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2. (Color online) The left panels show the total transmission (solid lines) and the largest transmission coefficients\n(dashed lines) as a function of energy for Au-Au (a), AuHe-Au (b) and Au-Xe-Au (c) junctions. The transmission\ncoefficients have been classified according to the magnitude\nof the eigenvalue. The right panels show the corresponding\nright moving wavefunctions of the dominant eigenchannel at\nthe Fermi energy for the same isosurface value.\n\nproposed by Lang4 (see Ref. [26]) or more recently by\nWeiss et al.32 for the H2 case. Therefore, we suggest that,\nat least for the He and Ne case, what causes the current\nsuppression is the induced polarization which decreases\nthe coupling between the two leads, reducing the transmission of the direct gold-to-gold path. The discrepancy\nbetween our results and those of Ref. [4] could be due to\nthe limitations of the jellium model used in that work.\nConvincing evidence of the validity of our arguments\nabove is provided by the analysis of the conduction channels. In the left panels of Fig. 2 we show both the total\ntransmission and the individual transmission coefficients\n{\u03c4i } as a function of energy for the Au-Au, Au-He-Au\nand Au-Xe-Au junctions. In the Au-Au junction the\ninterelectrode distance is the same as in the Au-He-Au\njunction. In all cases, the transmission at the Fermi energy is dominated by a single channel. More importantly,\nthe transmission coefficients are very similar for the AuAu and the Au-He-Au junctions, suggesting a common\ntransport mechanism, whereas for the Au-Xe-Au junction new features are visible around EF , originating from\nvalence p states of the Xe atom. The nature of the dominant channel at EF can be established by looking at the\ncorresponding wavefunctions of this eigenchannel. Such\n(right moving) wavefunctions for these three junctions\nare shown in the right panels of Fig. 2. They have been\ncalculated using the method described in Ref. [31]. Notice that there is no weight present in the gap region\neither in the Au-Au junctions, as expected, or in the AuHe-Au. On the other hand, in the Au-Xe-Au junction\nthe channel in the central region has the symmetry of\nthe Xe pz orbital, demonstrating that this orbital plays\nthe main role in the conduction through this junction, as\nhinted in Ref. [33]. This is at variance with the calculations of Ref. [7], where the transport through Xe was\n\n\f4\n\nG/G0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nAu - He - Au\nAu - Au\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nElongation (\u00c5)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFIG. 3.

An example of Au-He-Au and Au-Xe-Au junctions with hollow binding geometries is shown in Ref. [26].\nOn the other hand, one may wonder whether the special\nbehavior of the He is sensitive to the interelectrode distance. This is an important question since experimentally it is not easy to determine absolute distances, and\nthe influence of the He atoms has been deduced from\nthe conductance decay when the junctions are stretched\ntoward the tunnel regime. To answer this question, we\nhave simulated the stretching of a Au-He-Au junction\nstarting from the equilibrium geometry of Fig. 1. For\nthese calculations we have modeled the narrowest part of\nthe electrodes with clusters of 20 gold atoms, and have\nchecked that the results are consistent with those obtained with the larger clusters. In Fig. 3 we show the\nevolution of the conductance of the Au-He-Au junction\nupon separating the gold electrodes symmetrically from\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n\n9\n\nD. M. Eigler and E. K.

For comparison\nwe also include the results for the corresponding Au-Au\njunction. Fig. 3 shows that the presence of the He atom\nsuppresses the conductance also at larger distances. The\nconductance decay for both junctions can be roughly fitted with an exponential function G = Ae\u2212\u03b2d , where \u03b2 is\nthe attenuation factor and d corresponds to the elongation, as measured with respect to the equilibrium position. The attenuation factor \u03b2 is equal to 2.72 \u00c5\u22121 for\nthe junction with the He atom and 2.21 \u00c5\u22121 for the pure\ngold junction. The faster decay with the He atom is consistent with the experiments,9,10,12 and it shows that the\nconductance suppression can be more dramatic at large\ndistances (up to 82%).\nIn summary, we have presented a theoretical analysis\nof the influence of NG atoms on the conductance of\ngold atomic contacts. We have shown that He and\nNe atoms do not conduct and their effect is to reduce\nthe conductance of the metallic junctions due to polarization effects. As we consider the tunneling current\nthrough heavier noble gas atoms, the polarization effects\nincrease but they are compensated for by an increasing\ncontribution of the valence p states of the NG atoms,\nleading to an enhancement of the conductance. Our\nstudy shows that the presence of absorbed NG atoms\ncan modify significantly the conduction through atomicscale junctions, which has important implications for\na great variety of experiments in the field of molecular\nelectronics.\nWe thank E.
