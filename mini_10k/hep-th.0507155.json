In its original formulation this correspondence states that N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory\nin 3+1 dimensions is dual to type IIB supergravity on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . By adding additional\nstructure to both sides of the correspondence one can get interesting generalizations. In\nparticular, on the field theory side one can add spatial defects which reduce the amount of\nsupersymmetry but nevertheless preserve conformal invariance [3], giving rise to the so-called\n\"defect conformal field theories\" (dCFT).\nA holographic dual of four-dimensional N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory with a threedimensional defect was proposed in ref. [4] by Karch and Randall, who conjectured that\nsuch a dCFT can be realized in string theory by means of a D3-D5 intersection. In the nearhorizon limit the D3-branes give rise to an AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background, in which the D5-branes\nwrap an AdS4 \u00d7 S 2 submanifold. It was argued in ref. [4] that the AdS/CFT correspondence\nacts twice in this system and, apart from the holographic description of the four dimensional\nfield theory on the boundary of AdS5 , the fluctuations of the D5-brane should be dual to the\nphysics confined to the boundary of AdS4 . In the probe approximation the back-reaction of\nthe D5-branes on the near-horizon geometry of the D3-branes is neglected and the fluctuation\nmodes of the AdS4 -brane are described by the Dirac-Born-Infeld action of the D5-brane.\nThe defect conformal field theory associated with the D3-D5 intersection described above\ncorresponds to N = 4, d = 4 super Yang-Mills theory coupled to N = 4, d = 3 fundamental\nhypermultiplets localized at the defect. These hypermultiplets arise as a consequence of the\nstrings stretched between the D3- and D5-branes. In ref. [5] the action of this model was\nconstructed and a precise dictionary between operators of the field theory and fluctuation\nmodes of the probe was obtained (see also ref. [6]). The supersymmetry of the AdS4 \u00d7 S 2 \u2282\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 embedding of the D5-brane was explicitly verified in ref. [7] by using kappa\nsymmetry.\nThe defect field theories corresponding to other intersections have also been studied in the\nliterature. For example, from the D1-D3 intersection one gets a four-dimensional CFT with\na hypermultiplet localized on a one-dimensional defect [8]. Moreover, the D3-D3 intersection\ngives rise to a two-dimensional defect in a four-dimensional CFT. In this case one has, in\nthe probe approximation, a D3-brane probe wrapping an AdS3 \u00d7 S 1 submanifold of the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. In ref. [9] the spectrum of fluctuations of the D3-brane probe was\nobtained and the corresponding dual fields were identified. Let us finally mention that the\nD3-D7 intersection leads to a configuration in which the D7-brane fills completely the fourdimensional spacetime (a codimension zero \"defect\") which has been used to add flavor to\nN = 4 super Yang-Mills theory [10, 11, 12, 13].\nThe extension of the above ideas to more realistic theories is of great interest. It is\nimportant to recall in this respect that four dimensional gauge theories with N = 1 supersymmetry share some qualitative features with the physics of the real world such as, for\ninstance, confinement. One can think of modifying the theory by introducing defects (regions\nof space-time where some fields are localized), which break the SO(1, 3) Lorentz invariance.\nActually, the superalgebras of such field theories admit central charges associated with\nobjects extended in two or one space directions (codimension one and two, respectively).\n1\n\n\fFor instance, in SU(N) N = 1 SYM there are 1/2-BPS domain walls which interpolate\nbetween the inequivalent N vacua which come from the spontaneous breaking of the ZZ 2N\nsymmetry (the non-anomalous subgroup of the U(1)R ) to ZZ 2 by the gaugino condensate.\nThere can be also BPS codimension two objects, namely strings (flux tubes) which have been\nstudied in the context of different N = 1 theories, see [14] and references therein. For recent\nprogress along these lines, see also [15] and references therein. The physics of such objects\nturns out to be quite rich, including for instance the phenomenon of enhanced (supersized)\nsupersymmetry, also present for domain walls [15]. Holographically, these objects can be\nintroduced by adding D-branes to the setup. As argued above, one can also think of adding\nsupersymmetric defects also of codimension one or two. Since this modifies the lagrangian\nof the field theory, we expect, on general grounds, that the string theory setup should be\nmodified at infinity. Therefore, the defects should be dual to D-branes extending infinitely\nin the holographic direction.\nThe purpose of this work is to make a rather systematic search for possible supersymmetric embeddings for D-brane probes in a concrete model, the Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez dual [16, 17] to\nSU(N) N = 1 super Yang-Mills (for a review see [18]). As shown in ref. [19], the MaldacenaNu\u00f1ez background has a rich structure of submanifolds along which one can wrap a D5-brane\nprobe without breaking supersymmetry completely. Actually, a series of such embeddings\nin which the D5-brane probe fills all the gauge theory directions was found in ref. [19]. In\nthose configurations the probe preserves the same supersymmetry as the background and\nsome of them can be considered as flavor branes [20], suitable to study the meson spectrum\nof four-dimensional N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory.\nIn this paper we continue the analysis of [19] by studying the configurations of D5-brane\nprobes which are a codimension one or two defect in the gauge theory directions. As in\nref. [19] the main tool used will be kappa symmetry [21], which is based on the fact that\nthere exists certain matrix \u0393\u03ba such that, if \u01eb is a Killing spinor of the background, only\nthose embeddings satisfying \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb preserve some supersymmetry [22]. The matrix \u0393\u03ba\ndepends on the metric induced on the worldvolume of the probe and, actually, by imposing\nthe equation \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb one can systematically determine the supersymmetric embeddings\nof the probe and it is possible to identify the fraction of supersymmetry preserved by the\nconfiguration.\nObviously, to apply the technique sketched above one has to know first the Killing spinors\nof the background. For the Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez solution these spinors were determined in [19].\nIt will become clear from these spinors that only the D5-brane probes can have supersymmetric embeddings of the type we are interested in here. The configurations we will find\npreserve two of the four supersymmetries of the background. Of course, it would be interesting to find the backreaction in the geometry of the branes described above, but this is a\ntechnically challenging problem and is beyond the scope of the present work.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the main properties of the\nMaldacena-Nu\u00f1ez solution which we will need in the paper. In this section we will also\nrecall the kappa symmetry condition for supersymmetric probes and we will discuss the\ngeneral strategy to solve it. In section 3 we will find D5-brane embeddings which are wall\ndefects from the gauge theory point of view. In section 4 we will obtain supersymmetric\nconfigurations in which the D5-brane probe is extended only along one of the spatial gauge\n2\n\n\ftheory directions and behaves as a codimension two defect of the field theory. Section 5 is\ndevoted to summarize our results and to some concluding remarks. In appendix A we will\ndemonstrate that the solutions found in sections 2 and 3 saturate certain energy bound. In\nappendix B we discuss other wall defect solutions different from those found in the main\ntext.\n\n2\n\nThe Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez solution\n\nThe Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez (MN) background is a solution of the equations of motion of type\nIIB supergravity which preserves four supersymmetries. It can be obtained [16, 17] as a\nsolution of seven-dimensional gauged supergravity, which is a consistent truncation of tendimensional supergravity. The seven-dimensional solution is subsequently uplifted to ten\ndimensions. The ten-dimensional metric in the string frame is:\nh\ni\n1\nds210 = e\u03c6 dx21,3 + e2h ( d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + dr 2 + (w i \u2212 Ai )2 ,\n(2.1)\n4\nwhere \u03c6 is the dilaton, h is a function which depends on the radial coordinate r, the one-forms\nAi (i = 1, 2, 3) are\nA1 = \u2212a(r)d\u03b81 ,\n\nA2 = a(r) sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n\nA3 = \u2212 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nand the w i 's are su(2) left-invariant one-forms, satisfying dw i = \u2212 21 \u01ebijk w j \u2227 w k .

This solution is singular in the IR and coincides with\nthe regular MN background in the UV region r \u2192 \u221e. Indeed, by taking r \u2192 \u221e in the\nexpression of a(r) in eq. (2.4) one gets a(r) \u2192 0. Moreover, by neglecting exponentially\nsuppressed terms one gets:\ne2h = r \u2212\n\n1\n,\n4\n\n(a = 0) ,\n4\n\n(2.12)\n\n\fwhile \u03c6(r) can be obtained by using the expression of h given in eq. (2.12) on the last equation\nin (2.4). The RR three-form F(3) is still given by eq. (2.5), but now A1 = A2 = 0 and A3\nis the same as in eq. (2.2). We will refer to this solution as the abelian MN background.\nThe metric of this abelian MN background is singular at r = 41 (by redefining the radial\ncoordinate this singularity could be moved to r = 0). Moreover, the Killing spinors in this\nabelian case can be obtained from those of the regular background by simply putting \u03b1 = 0,\nwhich is indeed the value obtained by taking the r \u2192 \u221e limit on the right-hand side of eq.\n(2.8).\nSince dF(3) = 0, one can find a two-form potential C(2) such that F(3) = dC(2) . The\nexpression of C(2) , which will not be needed here, can be found in ref. [19]. Moreover, the\nequation of motion satisfied by F(3) is d\u2217 F(3) = 0, where \u2217 denotes Hodge duality. Therefore\none can write, at least locally, \u2217 F(3) = dC(6) , with C(6) being a six-form potential. The\nexpression of C(6) can be taken from the results of ref. [19], namely:\nC(6) = dx0 \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2227 C ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere C is the following two-form:\nC = \u2212\n\n\u0011\ne2\u03c6 h \u0010 2\n( a \u2212 1 )a2 e\u22122h \u2212 16 e2h cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2227 dr \u2212 ( a2 \u2212 1 ) e\u22122h w 3 \u2227 dr +\n8\n\n+ a\u2032\n\n\u0010\n\nsin \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2227 w 1 + d\u03b81 \u2227 w 2\n\n\u0011i\n\n.\n\n(2.14)\n\nIt is also interesting to recall the isometries of the abelian and non-abelian metrics. In the\nabelian solution a = 0 the angle \u03c8 does not appear in the expression of the metric (2.1) (only\nd\u03c8 does). Therefore, \u03c8 can be shifted by an arbitrary constant \u03bb as \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 + \u03bb. Actually,\nthis U(1) isometry of the abelian metric is broken quantum-mechanically to a ZZ 2N subgroup\nas a consequence of the flux quantization condition of the RR two-form potential [16, 23, 11].\nIn the gauge theory side this isometry can be identified with the U(1) R-symmetry, which\nis broken in the UV to the same ZZ 2N subgroup by a field theory anomaly. On the contrary,\nthe non-abelian metric does depend on \u03c8 through sin \u03c8 and cos \u03c8 and, therefore, only the\ndiscrete ZZ 2 isometry \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 + 2\u03c0 remains when a 6= 0. This fact has been interpreted\n[16, 24] as the string theory dual of the spontaneous breaking of the R-symmetry induced\nby the gluino condensate in the IR.\n\n2.1\n\nSupersymmetric Probes\n\nWe will now consider a Dp-brane probe embedded in the MN geometry (2.1). If we denote\nby \u03be \u03bc (\u03bc = 0, * * * , p) a set of worldvolume coordinates and if X M are ten-dimensional coordinates, the embedding of the Dp-brane is determined by a set of functions X M (\u03be \u03bc ). The\ninduced metric on the worldvolume is defined as:\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc X M \u2202\u03bd X N GM N ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere GM N is the ten-dimensional metric (2.1). Moreover, let eM denote the one-forms of\nthe frame basis (2.6). The eM one-forms can be written in terms of the differentials of the\n5\n\n\fM\n\ncoordinates by means of the vielbein coefficients EN , namely:\nM\n\neM = EN dX N .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThen, the induced Dirac matrices on the worldvolume are defined as\nN\n\n\u03b3\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc X M EM \u0393N ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere \u0393N are constant ten-dimensional Dirac matrices. The supersymmetric BPS configurations of the brane probe are obtained by imposing the condition:\n\u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03ba is a matrix which depends on the embedding of the probe (see below) and \u01eb is a\nKilling spinor of the background. In order to write the expression of \u0393\u03ba it is convenient to\ndecompose the complex spinor \u01eb used up to now in its real and imaginary parts as \u01eb = \u01eb\u00121 +i\u01eb\n\u00132 .\n\u01eb1\nWe shall arrange the two Majorana-Weyl spinors \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 as a two-dimensional vector\n.\n\u01eb2\nIt is straightforward to find the following rules to pass from complex to real spinors:\n\u01eb\u2217 \u2194 \u03c43 \u01eb ,\n\ni\u01eb\u2217 \u2194 \u03c41 \u01eb ,\n\ni\u01eb \u2194 \u2212i\u03c42 \u01eb ,\n\n(2.19)\n\n\u01eb1\n.\n\u01eb2\nWe will assume that there are not worldvolume gauge fields on the D-brane, which is\nconsistent with the equations of motion of the probe if there are not source terms which\ncould induce them. These source terms must be linear in the gauge field and can only be\noriginated in the Wess-Zumino part of the probe action. For the cases considered below\nwe will verify that the RR potentials of the MN background do not act as source of the\nworldvolume gauge fields and, therefore, the latter can be consistently put to zero. If this\nis the case, the kappa symmetry matrix of a Dp-brane in the type IIB theory, acting on the\nreal two-component spinors, is given by [22]:\n\nwhere the \u03c4i (i = 1, 2, 3) are Pauli matrices that act on the two-dimensional vector\n\n\u0393\u03ba =\n\np\u22123\n1\n\u221a\n\u01eb\u03bc1 ***\u03bcp+1 (\u03c43 ) 2 i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03b3\u03bc1 ***\u03bcp+1 ,\n(p + 1)! \u2212g\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere g is the determinant of the induced metric g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b3\u03bc1 ***\u03bcp+1 denotes the antisymmetrized product of the induced gamma matrices.\nThe kappa symmetry equation \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb imposes a condition on the Killing spinors which\nshould be compatible with the ones required by the supersymmetry of the background. These\nlatter conditions are precisely the ones written in eq. (2.7). In particular (see eq. (2.7))\nthe spinor \u01eb must be such that \u01eb = i\u01eb\u2217 , which in the real notation is equivalent to \u03c41 \u01eb = \u01eb.\nNotice that the Pauli matrix appearing in the expression of \u0393\u03ba in (2.20) is \u03c41 or \u03c42 , depending\non the dimensionality of the probe. Clearly, the conditions \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb and \u03c41 \u01eb = \u01eb can only\nbe compatible if \u0393\u03ba contains the Pauli matrix \u03c41 . By inspecting eq. (2.20) one readily\nrealizes that this happens for p = 1, 5. Moreover, we want our probes to be extended both\nalong the spatial Minkowski and internal directions, which is not possible for Lorentzian\n6\n\n\fD1-branes and leaves us with the D5-branes as the only case to be studied. Notice that for\nthe MN background the only couplings of the Wess-Zumino term of the action linear in the\nworldvolume gauge field F are of the form C (2) \u2227 F and C (6) \u2227 F , where C (2) and C (6) are the\nRR potentials. By simple counting of the degree of these forms one immediately concludes\nthat these terms are not present in the action of a D5-brane and, thus, the gauge fields can\nbe consistently taken to be zero, as claimed above.\nComing back to the complex notation for the spinors, and taking into account the fact\nthat the Killing spinors of the MN background satisfy the condition \u01eb = i\u01eb\u2217 , one can write\nthe matrix \u0393\u03ba for a D5-brane probe as:\n1 1\n\u221a\n\u0393\u03ba =\n\u01eb\u03bc1 ***\u03bc6 \u03b3\u03bc1 ***\u03bc6 .\n(2.21)\n6! \u2212g\nNotice that, for a general embedding, the kappa symmetry condition \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb imposes a\nnew projection to the Killing spinor \u01eb. This new projection is not, in general, consistent with\nthe conditions (2.7), since it involves matrices which do not commute with those appearing\nin (2.7). The only way of making the equation \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb and (2.7) consistent with each\nother is by requiring the vanishing of the coefficients of those non-commuting matrices. On\nthe contrary, the terms in \u0393\u03ba which commute with the projections (2.7) should act on the\nKilling spinors as the unit matrix. These conditions will give rise to a set of first-order BPS\ndifferential equations. By solving these BPS equations we will determine the embeddings\nof the D5-brane we are interested in, namely those which preserve some fraction of the\nbackground supersymmetry.\n\n3\n\nWall defects\n\nIn this section we are going to find supersymmetric configurations of a D5-brane probe\nwhich, from the point of view of the four-dimensional gauge theory, are codimension one\nobjects. Accordingly, we extend the D5-brane along three of the Minkowski coordinates x\u03bc\n(say x0 , x1 , x2 ) and along a three dimensional submanifold of the internal part of the metric.\nTo describe these configurations it is convenient to choose the following set of worldvolume\ncoordinates:\n\u03be m = (x0 , x1 , x2 , r, \u03b81 , \u03c61 ) .\n(3.1)\nMoreover, we will adopt the following ansatz for the dependence of the remaining tendimensional coordinates on the \u03be \u03bc 's:\nx3 = x3 (r),\n\u03b82 = \u03b82 (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) ,\n\u03c62 = \u03c62 (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) ,\n\u03c8 = \u03c80 = constant ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn the appendix B we will explore other possibilities and, in particular, we will study configurations for which \u03c8 is not constant. For the set of worldvolume coordinates (3.1) the kappa\nsymmetry matrix acts on the Killing spinors \u01eb as:\n1\n\u03b3x0 x1 x2 r\u03b81 \u03c61 \u01eb .\n(3.3)\n\u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u221a\n\u2212g\n7\n\n\fThe induced gamma matrices appearing on the right-hand side of eq. (3.3) can be straightforwardly computed from the general expression (2.17).

In particular, eq. (2.18) should be consistent\nwith the second projection written in (2.7), namely \u039312 \u01eb = \u0393\u030212 \u01eb. It is rather obvious that\nthe terms in (3.7) containing the matrix \u0393\u03023 do not fulfil this requirement. Therefore we must\nimpose the vanishing of their coefficients, i.e.:\nc13\u0302 = c1\u03023\u0302 = c2\u03023\u0302 = c23\u0302 = 0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nBy inspecting the last four equations in (3.8) one readily realizes that the conditions (3.9)\nare equivalent to:\nV3\u03b8 = V3\u03c6 = 0 .\n(3.10)\nMoreover, from the expression of V3\u03b8 in (3.5) we conclude that the condition V3\u03b8 = 0 implies\nthat\n\u03c62 = \u03c62 (\u03c61 ) .\n(3.11)\nFurthermore (see eq.

In order to fulfil this requirement\nwe have to impose an extra projection to the spinor \u01eb. Let us define the corresponding\nprojector as:\nP\u2217 \u2261 \u03b21 \u0393\u2217 + \u03b22 \u0393\u030212 \u0393\u2217 ,\n(3.23)\n\nwhere \u03b21 and \u03b22 are constants. We will require that \u01eb satisfies the condition:\nP\u2217 \u01eb = \u03c3 \u01eb ,\n\n(3.24)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = \u00b11. For consistency P\u22172 = 1, which, as the matrices \u0393\u2217 and \u0393\u030212 \u0393\u2217 anticommute,\nimplies that \u03b212 + \u03b222 = 1. Accordingly, let us parametrize \u03b21 and \u03b22 in terms of a constant\nangle \u03b2 as \u03b21 = cos \u03b2 and \u03b22 = sin \u03b2. The extra projection (3.24) takes the form:\ne\u03b2 \u0393\u030212 \u0393\u2217 \u01eb = \u03c3\u01eb .\n\n(3.25)\n\nMaking use of the condition (3.25), we can write the right-hand side of eq.

Accordingly, we must\nrequire that the coefficient of \u0393\u030212 in (3.26) vanishes which, in turn, leads to the relation:\ntan(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c80 ) =\n\n \u0303\n\u2206\n.\n\u2206\n\n(3.27)\n\n \u0303\nIn particular eq.

Let us write:\n \u0303\n\u2206\n= p = constant .\n\u2206\n\n(3.28)\n\nLet us now consider the last three terms in (3.21), which contain matrices that do not\ncommute with the projection \u0393r \u0393\u0302123 \u01eb = \u01eb. By using the projection (3.25) these terms can\nbe written as:\n\u0014\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\u0015\n\n( c12 \u0393\u2217 + \u2202r x c12\u0302 ) \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u2212 \u2202r x c11\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03022 \u01eb =\n=\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(\u2202r x3 c12\u0302 \u2212 \u03c3c12 cos \u03b2 ) \u03931 \u0393\u03021 + (\u03c3c12 sin \u03b2 \u2212 \u2202r x3 c11\u0302 ) \u03931\u0393\u03022 \u01eb .\n\n(3.29)\n\nThis contribution should vanish. By inspecting the right-hand side of eq. (3.29) one immediately concludes that this vanishing condition determines the value of \u2202r x3 , namely:\n\u2202r x3 = \u03c3 c12\n\nsin \u03b2\ncos \u03b2\n= \u03c3 c12\n.\nc12\u0302\nc11\u0302\n11\n\n(3.30)\n\n\fThe compatibility between the two expressions of \u2202r x3 in eq. (3.30) requires that tan \u03b2 =\nc11\u0302 /c12\u0302 . By using the values of c11\u0302 and c12\u0302 written in eq. (3.17) it is easy to verify that this\ncompatibility condition is equivalent to (3.27). Moreover, one can write eq.

However, since in our ansatz\nx3 = x3 (r), eq. (3.31) is only consistent if \u2206 is independent of (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ), i.e. when \u2206 is\nconstant. By looking at eq. (3.19) one readily realizes that this can only happen if m2 = 1,\ni.e.:\nm = \u00b11 .\n(3.32)\nIn this case (see eq. (3.19)) \u2206 is given by\n\u2206=m.\n\n(3.33)\n\n \u0303 = p\u2206 (see eq.

Thus, we must\ndefinition of \u2206\nhave:\n \u0303 = 0.\n\u2206\n(3.34)\nNotice that this implies that \u03b82 is independent of \u03c61 and, therefore:\n\u03b82 = \u03b82 (\u03b81 ) .\n\n(3.35)\n\n \u0303 = 0, eq. (3.27) can be solved by putting \u03b2 = \u03c80 + n\u03c0 with n \u2208 ZZ . Without loss of\nWhen \u2206\ngenerality we can take n = 0 or, equivalently, \u03b2 = \u03c80 . Then, it follows from (3.25) that we\nmust require that \u01eb be an eigenvector of e\u03c80 \u0393\u030212 \u0393\u2217 , namely\ne\u03c80 \u0393\u030212 \u0393\u2217 \u01eb = \u03c3\u01eb .\n\n(3.36)\n\nMoreover, by putting \u2206 = m, \u03b2 = \u03c80 and p = 0, eq.

It is easy to prove\ncan restrict ourselves to the case in which \u03b82 = \u03b82 (\u03b81 ), i.e. with \u2206\nthat in this case the combinations of c12 and c12\u0302 appearing above reduce to:\nc12 cos \u03b1 + c12\u0302 sin \u03b1 =\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nr coth 2r \u2212\n2\n\nc12\u0302 cos \u03b1 \u2212 c12 sin \u03b1 = eh\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u0014\n\n\u2206 cos \u03c80\ncoth 2r \u2212\nsinh 2r\n\n1\n\u2206 cos \u03c80 coth 2r \u2212\nsinh 2r\n\n#\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n.\n\n(3.56)\n\nTo derive this result we have used the following useful relations:\neh sin \u03b1 +\n\na\n1\ncos \u03b1 =\n2\nsinh 2r\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u2212 r coth 2r ,\n2\n\u0015\n\na\nsin \u03b1 = eh coth 2r ,\n2\n\u0013\neh\n1\na2\nh\nsin\n\u03b1\n+\nae\ncos\n\u03b1\n=\n\u2212\n,\n\u2212\n4\n4\nsinh 2r\n\neh cos \u03b1 \u2212\n\u0012\n\ne2h\n\n\u0012\n\ne2h \u2212\n\na2\n1\n\u2212\n4\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\n\ncos \u03b1 \u2212 aeh sin \u03b1 = coth 2r r coth 2r \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(3.57)\n\nwhich can be easily demonstrated by using eqs. (2.4) and (2.8). Clearly, in order to satisfy\n(3.49) we must require that\nA1\u03022\u0302 = BI = B1\u03022\u0302 = 0 .\n(3.58)\nLet us now consider the A1\u03022\u0302 = 0 equation first. It is easy to conclude that this equation\nreduces to:\n#\n\u0014\n1\n= 0.\n(3.59)\nsin \u03c80 (1 \u2212 coth 2r)\u2206 cos \u03c80 +\nsinh 2r\n\nIf sin \u03c80 6= 0 the above equation can be used to obtain an expression of \u2206 with a non-trivial\ndependence on the radial variable r, which is in contradiction with eq. (3.19). Thus we\nconclude that sin \u03c80 must vanish, i.e. only four values of \u03c80 are possible, namely:\n\u03c80 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 .\n15\n\n(3.60)\n\n\fLet us denote\n\u03bb \u2261 cos \u03c80 = \u00b11 .\n\n(3.61)\n\nThen, the condition B1\u03022\u0302 = 0 is automatically satisfied when sin \u03c80 = 0, while BI = 0 leads\nto the following equation for \u2202r x3 :\n3\n\n\u2212h\n\n\u2202r x = \u03bb\u03c3 e\n\ncosh 2r \u2212 \u2206\u03bb\n1\nr coth 2r \u2212\n\u2206\u03bb cosh 2r \u2212 1\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(3.62)\n\nAs in the abelian case, the consistency of the above equation with our ansatz for x3 requires\nthat \u2206 be constant which, in turn, only can be achieved if m = \u00b11 and \u2206 = m. Notice that\nthis implies that the angular equations for the embedding are exactly those written in eq.\n(3.45) for the abelian case. Moreover, when \u03b82 = \u03b82 (\u03b81 ) and \u03c62 = \u03c62 (\u03c61 ) are given as in eq.\n(3.45), the determinant of the induced metric is\n\u221a\n\n3\u03c6\n\n\u2212g = e\n\nr\nsin \u03b81\nsinh 2r\n\n\u0014\n\ncosh 2r \u2212 \u03bbm\n\n\u0015q\n\n1 + (\u2202r x3 )2 .\n\n(3.63)\n\nWhen x3 satisfies the differential equation (3.62), one can easily demonstrate that:\nq\n\n1 + (\u2202r x3 )2 |BP S = re\u2212h ,\n\nand, using this result to evaluate the right-hand side of (3.63), one arrives at:\n\u221a\ne3\u03c6 sin \u03b81 AI |BP S = \u03c3m \u2212g |BP S .\n\n(3.64)\n\n(3.65)\n\nTherefore, one must take \u03c3 = m in order to satisfy eq. (3.49). When sin \u03c80 = 0, the extra\nprojection (3.52) on the asymptotic spinor \u01eb0 is\n\u0393\u2217 \u01eb0 = \u03bb m \u01eb0 ,\n\n(3.66)\n\nwhich is equivalent to the following projection on the complete spinor \u01eb:\ne\u03b1\u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u0393\u2217 \u01eb = \u03bb m \u01eb .\n\n(3.67)\n\nMoreover, the differential equation which determines x3 (r) is:\ndx3\n1\n= e\u2212h r coth 2r \u2212\ndr\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(3.68)\n\nIt is straightforward to demonstrate that this equation coincides with the abelian one in the\nUV. Actually, in figure 1 we represent the result of integrating eq. (3.68) and we compare\nthis result with that given by the function x3 (r) for the abelian background (eq. (3.46)).\nMoreover, if we fix the embedding \u03b82 = \u03b82 (\u03b81 ), \u03c62 = \u03c62 (\u03c61 ) and x3 = x3 (r) we have two\npossible projections, corresponding to the two possible values of \u03bb. Each of these values of \u03bb\ncorresponds to two values of the angle \u03c80 , which again shows that the U(1) symmetry of the\nabelian theory is broken to ZZ 2 . One can check that the embeddings characterized by eqs.\n(3.45), (3.60) and (3.68) satisfy the equations of motion derived from the Dirac-Born-Infeld\naction of the probe. Moreover, it is shown in appendix A that these embeddings saturate an\nenergy bound, as expected for BPS worldvolume solitons.\n16\n\n\fx3\n\n10\n\n6\n\n2\n2\n\n6\n\nr\n\nFigure 1: In this figure we represent the function x3 (r) for the wall defect in the non-abelian\nbackground (solid line). The dashed line represents x3 (r) for the abelian background as\ngiven by eq. (3.46). In both cases the constant of integration has been fixed by requiring\nthat the minimal value of x3 is 0.\n\n4\n\nTwo-dimensional defects\n\nIn this section we will determine BPS configurations of a D5-brane which extends along two\nMinkowski coordinates (say x0 and x1 ) and along a four-dimensional submanifold embedded\nin the internal part of the metric (2.1). Such branes would be a two-dimensional object\nfrom the gauge theory perspective and, actually, we will find that they preserve the same\nsupersymmetries as a D1-string stretched along x1 . In order to find these configurations\nfrom the kappa symmetry condition \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb let us choose the following set of worldvolume\ncoordinates for the D5-brane:\n\u03be \u03bc = (x0 , x1 , \u03b81 , \u03c61 , \u03b82 , \u03c62 ) ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nand let us consider an embedding of the type\nr = r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) ,\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c8(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwith x2 and x3 being constant1 . From our general expression (2.21) it is straightforward to\nprove that in this case \u0393\u03ba \u01eb is given by:\ne\u03c6\n\u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u221a\n\u0393 x 0 x 1 \u03b3 \u03b8 1 \u03c61 \u03b8 2 \u03c62 \u01eb .\n\u2212g\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe induced Dirac matrices \u03b3\u03b8i and \u03b3\u03c6i are easily obtained by using in eq.

With the purpose of writing these matrices in a convenient\nform, let us define the quantities:\n\u2206i \u2261\n\n1 cos \u03b8i + \u2202\u03c6i \u03c8\n,\n2\nsin \u03b8i\n\n1\n\n(4.4)\n\nFor two-dimensional defects obtained with a different election of worldvolume coordinates and ansatz,\nsee appendix B.\n\n17\n\n\fin terms of which the \u03b3-matrices are:\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3\u03b81 = eh \u03931 +\n\na\n\u0393\u03021 + \u2202\u03b81 r \u0393r ,\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\na\ne\u2212 2\n\u03b3\u03c61 = eh \u03932 \u2212 \u0393\u03022 + \u22061 \u0393\u03023 ,\nsin \u03b81\n2\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3\u03b82 =\n\n1\n1\ncos \u03c8 \u0393\u03021 \u2212 sin \u03c8 \u0393\u03022 + \u2202\u03b82 r \u0393r ,\n2\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2\n1\n1\n\u03b3 \u03c62 =\nsin \u03c8 \u0393\u03021 + cos \u03c8 \u0393\u03022 + \u22062 \u0393\u03023 .\nsin \u03b82\n2\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nBy using eqs. (4.5) and (2.7) the action of the antisymmetrized product of the \u03b3's on the\nKilling spinors \u01eb can be readily obtained. It is of the form:\ne\u22122\u03c6\n\u03b3\u03b8 \u03c6 \u03b8 \u03c6 \u01eb\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 1 1 2 2\n\n=\n\n[ bI + b22\u0302 \u03932 \u0393\u03022 + b12 \u039312 + b12\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03022 + b13\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03023 +\n+ b1\u03023\u0302 \u0393\u030213 + b2\u03023\u0302 \u0393\u030223 + b23\u0302 \u03932 \u0393\u03023 ] \u01eb ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere the b's are functions whose expression depends on the embedding of the probe. In\norder to write them more compactly let us define \u039b1 and \u039b2 as follows:\n\u039b1 \u2261\n\ni\nh\ni\na2\na\n1h\n\u2202\u03b81 r \u2212 a cos \u03c8 \u2202\u03b82 r \u22061 + ( e2h \u2212 )\u2202\u03b82 r + cos \u03c8 \u2202\u03b81 r \u22062 ,\n4\n4\n4\n\n\u039b2 \u2261 \u2212\n\ni\neh\neh h\ncos \u03c8 \u2202\u03b81 r \u2212 2a \u2202\u03b82 r \u22062 +\ncos \u03c8 \u2202\u03b82 r \u22061 ,\n2\n2\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u22061 and \u22062 have been defined in eq.

(4.6) one immediately realizes that the terms\ncontaining the matrix \u0393\u03023 give rise to contributions to \u0393\u03ba which do not commute with the\nprojection \u039312 \u01eb = \u0393\u030212 \u01eb satisfied by the Killing spinors (see eq. (2.7)). Then, if we want\nthat the supersymmetry preserved by the probe be compatible with that of the background,\nthe coefficients of these terms must vanish. Moreover, we would like to obtain embeddings of\nthe D5-brane probe which preserve the same supersymmetry as a D1-string extended along\nthe x1 direction. Accordingly2 , we shall require the vanishing of all terms on the right-hand\nside of eq. (4.6) except for the one proportional to the unit matrix, i.e.:\nb22\u0302 = b12 = b12\u0302 = b13\u0302 = b1\u03023\u0302 = b2\u03023\u0302 = b23\u0302 = 0 .\n\n(4.9)\n\nBy plugging the explicit form of the b's in (4.9), one gets a system of differential equations\nfor the embedding which will be analyzed in the rest of this section.\n\n4.1\n\nAbelian worldvolume solitons\n\nThe above equations (4.9) are quite complicated. In order to simplify the problem, let us\nconsider first the equations for the embedding in the abelian background, which can be\nobtained from the general ones by putting a = \u03b1 = 0. In this case from b2\u03023\u0302 = b23\u0302 = 0 we get\n\u2202\u03b8i r = \u2212\u2206i , where the \u2206i 's have been defined in eq. (4.4). More explicitly:\n\u2202\u03b8i r = \u2212\n\n1 cos \u03b8i + \u2202\u03c6i \u03c8\n.\n2\nsin \u03b8i\n\n(4.10)\n\nOne can verify that the other b\u2032 s in (4.9) vanish if these differential equations are satisfied.\nLet us see the form of the kappa symmetry condition when the BPS equations (4.10) are\nsatisfied. For the abelian background, the determinant of the induced metric is given by:\n\u221a\n\n\u2212g =\n\ni1\ni1 h\nh\ne3\u03c6\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 (\u2202\u03b81 r)2 + 4e2h (\u2202\u03b82 r)2 + e2h 2 \u220621 + 4e2h \u220622 + e2h 2 , (4.11)\n4\n\nand the coefficient bI is:\nbI =\n\ne2h\n1\n\u2202\u03b81 r \u22061 + e2h \u2202\u03b82 r \u22062 \u2212\n.\n4\n4\n\n2\n\n(4.12)\n\nFrom a detailed analysis of the form of the b's one can show that the requirement of the vanishing of\nthe coefficients of the terms containing the matrix \u0393\u03023 implies the vanishing of b22\u0302 , b12 and b12\u0302 . Therefore,\nwe are not loosing generality by imposing (4.9).\n\n19\n\n\fIf the BPS equations \u2202\u03b8i r = \u2212\u2206i hold, one can verify by inspection that:\n\u221a\ne\u22123\u03c6 \u2212g |BP S = \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 bI |BP S ,\n\n(4.13)\n\nand, thus, the kappa symmetry condition (2.18) becomes\n\u0393x 0 x 1 \u01eb = \u2212 \u01eb ,\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhich indeed corresponds to a D1 string extended along x1 . In this abelian case the spinors\n\u01eb and \u03b7 in eq. (2.10) differ in a function which commutes with everything. Therefore, the\ncondition (4.14) translates into the same condition for the constant spinor \u03b7, namely:\n\u0393x 0 x 1 \u03b7 = \u2212 \u03b7 .\n\n(4.15)\n\nIt follows that this configuration is 1/16 supersymmetric: it preserves the two supersymmetries determined by eqs. (2.11) and (4.15).\n4.1.1\n\nIntegration of the first-order equations\n\nThe BPS equations (4.10) relate the partial derivatives of r with those of \u03c8. According to\nour ansatz (4.2) the only dependence on \u03c61 and \u03c62 in (4.10) comes from the derivatives of\n\u03c8. Therefore, for consistency of eq. (4.10) with our ansatz we must have:\n\u2202\u03c61 \u03c8 = n1 ,\n\n\u2202\u03c62 \u03c8 = n2 ,\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are two constant numbers. Thus, \u03c8 must be given by:\n\u03c8 = n1 \u03c61 + n2 \u03c62 + constant .\n\n(4.17)\n\nUsing this form of \u03c8(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) in eq. (4.10) , one can easily integrate r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), namely:\ne2r = \u0010\n\nC\nsin\n\n\u03b81\n2\n\n\u0011n1 +1 \u0010\n\ncos\n\n\u03b81\n2\n\n\u00111\u2212n1 \u0010\n\nsin\n\n\u03b82\n2\n\n\u0011n2 +1 \u0010\n\ncos\n\n\u03b82\n2\n\n\u00111\u2212n2\n\n,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere C is a constant. From the analysis of eq. (4.18) one easily concludes that not all\nthe values of the constants n1 and n2 are possible. Indeed, the left-hand side of eq. (4.18)\nis always greater than one, whereas the right-hand side always vanishes for some value of\n\u03b8i if |ni | > 1. Actually, we will verify in the next subsection that only when n1 = n2 = 0\n(i.e. when \u03c8 = constant) we will be able to generalize the embedding to the non-abelian\ngeometry. Therefore, from now on we will concentrate only in this case, which we rewrite\nas:\ne2r\u2217\n,\n(n1 = n2 = 0) ,\n(4.19)\ne2r =\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82\nwhere r\u2217 = r(\u03b81 = \u03c0/2, \u03b82 = \u03c0/2) is the minimal value of r. It is clear from (4.19) that\nr diverges at \u03b8i = 0, \u03c0. Therefore our effective strings extend infinitely in the holographic\ncoordinate r.\n20\n\n\f4.2\n\nNon-Abelian worldvolume solitons\n\nLet us consider now the more complicated case of the non-abelian background. We are\ngoing to argue that the kappa symmetry condition can only be solved if \u03c8 is constant and\nsin \u03c8 = 0. Indeed, let us assume that sin \u03c8 does not vanish. If this is the case, by combining\nthe conditions b1\u03023\u0302 = 0 and b2\u03023\u0302 = 0 one gets \u2202\u03b81 r = 0. Using this result in the equation b12 = 0,\none concludes that \u2202\u03b82 r = 0 (notice that the functions \u2206i can never vanish). However, if r\nis independent of the \u03b8i 's the equation b13\u0302 = 0 can never be fulfilled. Thus, we arrive at a\ncontradiction that can only be resolved if sin \u03c8 = 0. Then, one must have:\n\u03c8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 = 0 (mod \u03c0) .\n\n(4.20)\n\n\u03bb \u2261 cos \u03c8 = \u00b11 .\n\n(4.21)\n\nLet us now define\nThus, in this non-abelian case we are only going to have zero-winding embeddings, i.e.,\nas anticipated above, only the solutions with n1 = n2 = 0 in eq. (4.18) generalize to the\nnon-abelian case. Since \u03c8 is constant, we now have\n\u2206i =\n\n1\ncot \u03b8i .\n2\n\n(4.22)\n\nWhen sin \u03c8 = 0 the equations b12 = b12\u0302 = b1\u03023\u0302 = b13\u0302 = 0 are automatically satisfied.\nMoreover, the conditions b2\u03023\u0302 = b23\u0302 = 0 reduce to:\nsin \u03b1 \u2202\u03b81 r + 2\u03bb ( eh cos \u03b1 \u2212\n\na\nsin \u03b1 ) \u2202\u03b82 r + \u03bbeh cot \u03b82 = 0 ,\n2\n\ncos \u03b1 \u2202\u03b81 r \u2212 2\u03bb ( eh sin \u03b1 +\n\na\n\u03bba\n1\ncos \u03b1 ) \u2202\u03b82 r +\ncot \u03b82 + cot \u03b81 = 0 .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(4.23)\n\nFrom eq. (4.23) one can obtain the values of the partial derivatives of r. Indeed, let us define\n\u2206\u03b81 \u2261\n\n1\n\u03bb cot \u03b82\ncot \u03b81 coth(2r) +\n,\n2\n2 sinh(2r)\n\n\u2206\u03b82 \u2261\n\n1\n\u03bb cot \u03b81\ncot \u03b82 coth(2r) +\n.\n2\n2 sinh(2r)\n\n(4.24)\n\nThen, one has\n\u2202\u03b8i r = \u2212\u2206\u03b8i .\n\n(4.25)\n\nTo derive this result we have used some of the identities written in eq. (3.57). Notice that\n\u2206\u03b8i \u2192 \u2206i when r \u2192 \u221e and the non-abelian BPS equations (4.25) coincide with the abelian\nones in eq. (4.10) for n1 = n2 = 0 in this limit. After some calculation one can check that\nb22\u0302 also vanishes as a consequence of (4.25). Indeed, one can prove that b22\u0302 can be written:\nb22\u0302 =\n\ni\n\u03bbeh h\n\u2206\u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 r \u2212 \u2206\u03b82 \u2202\u03b81 r ,\n2\n\n21\n\n(4.26)\n\n\fwhich clearly vanishes if eq. (4.25) is satisfied.\nFor a general function r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), when the angle \u03c8 takes the values written in eq. (4.20),\nthe determinant of the induced metric takes the form:\n\u221a\n\n\u2212g =\n\ni1\nh\na2\ne3\u03c6\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 (\u2202\u03b81 r)2 + 4(e2h +\n)(\u2202\u03b82 r)2 \u2212 2a\u03bb\u2202\u03b81 r\u2202\u03b82 r + e2h 2 \u00d7\n4\n4\nh\n\n\u00d7 \u22062\u03b81 + 4(e2h +\n\ni1\na2\n) \u22062\u03b82 \u2212 2a\u03bb\u2206\u03b81 \u2206\u03b82 + e2h 2 .\n4\n\n(4.27)\n\nIf the BPS equations (4.25) are satisfied, the two factors under the square root on the righthand side of eq. (4.27) become equal. Moreover, one can prove that:\nbI =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\ne2h\n1\na2\n\u2202\u03b81 r (\u2206\u03b81 \u2212 \u03bba\u2206\u03b82 ) + \u2202\u03b82 r 4 (e2h +\n) \u2206\u03b82 \u2212 \u03bba\u2206\u03b81 \u2212\n.\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n(4.28)\n\nUsing this result one can demonstrate, after some calculation, that eq. (4.13) is also satisfied\nin this non-abelian case. As a consequence, the kappa symmetry projection reduces to the\none written in eq. (4.14), i.e. to that corresponding to a D1-brane.\n4.2.1\n\nIntegration of the first-order equations\n\nIn order to integrate the first order equations (4.25) for r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), let us define the new variable\ny(r) as:\ny(r) \u2261 cosh(2r) .\n(4.29)\n\nIn terms of y, the BPS system (4.25) can be greatly simplified, namely:\n\u2202\u03b81 y + cot \u03b81 y = \u2212\u03bb cot \u03b82 ,\n\u2202\u03b82 y + cot \u03b82 y = \u2212\u03bb cot \u03b81 ,\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhich can be easily integrated by the method of variation of constants. In terms of the\noriginal variable r one has:\ncosh(2r) =\n\ncosh(2r\u2217 ) + \u03bb cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82\n,\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhere r\u2217 \u2261 r(\u03b81 = \u03c0/2, \u03b82 = \u03c0/2) is the minimal value of r. This is a remarkably simple\nsolution for the very complicated system of kappa symmetry equations. Notice that there\nare two solutions for r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), which correspond to the two possible values of \u03bb on the righthand side of (4.31). If \u03bb = +1 (\u03bb = \u22121) the angle \u03c8 is fixed to \u03c8 = 0, 2\u03c0 (\u03c8 = \u03c0, 3\u03c0).\nThus, the U(1) symmetry \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 + \u01eb of the abelian case is broken to ZZ 2 , reflecting the\nsame breaking that occurs in the geometry. Moreover, it follows from (4.31) that r diverges\nat \u03b81,2 = 0, \u03c0. It is easily proved that the embedding written in eqs. (4.20) and (4.31)\nsatisfies the equations of motion of the probe and, actually, it saturates a BPS energy bound\n(see appendix A). Moreover, in appendix B we will find new codimension two defects in the\nnon-abelian background for which the angle \u03c8 is not constant.\n22\n\n\f5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn this paper we have systematically studied the possibility of adding supersymmetric configurations of D5-brane probes in the MN background in such a way that they create a\ncodimension one or two defect in the gauge theory directions. The technique, thoroughly\nexplained in sections 2 and 3, consists of using kappa symmetry to look for a system of\nfirst-order equations which guarantee that the supersymmetry preserved by the worldvolume of the probe is consistent with that of the background. Although the general system of\nequations obtained from kappa symmetry is very involved, the solutions we have found are\nremarkably simple. For a given election of worldvolume coordinates and a given ansatz for\nthe embedding, chosen for their simplicity and physical significance, the result is unique.\nIn order to extract consequences of our results in the gauge theory dual, some additional\nwork must be done. First of all, one can study the fluctuations of the probes around the\nconfigurations found here and one can try to obtain the dictionary between these fluctuations\nand the corresponding operators in the field theory side, along the lines of refs. [5, 9]. In the\nanalysis of these fluctuations we will presumably find the difficulties associated with the UV\nblowup of the dilaton, which could be overcome by using the methods employed in ref. [19]\nin the case of flavor branes (see also ref. [25] for a similar approach in the case of the glueball\nspectrum of the MN background). Once this fluctuation-operator dictionary is obtained we\ncould try to give some meaning to the functions x3 (r) and r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) of eqs. (3.68) and (4.31)\nrespectively, which should encode some renormalization group flow of the defect theory.\nLet us also point out that one could explore with the same techniques employed here some\nother supergravity backgrounds (such as the one obtained in [26], which are dual to N = 1,\nd = 3 super Yang-Mills theory) and try to find the configurations of probes which introduce\nsupersymmetric defects in the field theory. It is also worth mentioning that, although we\nhave focussed here on the analysis of the supersymmetric objects in the MN background,\nwe could have stable non-supersymmetric configurations, such as the confining strings of\nref. [27], which are constructed from D3-branes wrapping a two-sphere. Another example\nof an interesting non-supersymmetric configuration is the baryon vertex, which consists of a\nD3-brane wrapped on a three-cycle which captures the RR flux [28].\nFinally, it is also interesting to figure out which kind of brane configurations of the type\nIIA theory correspond to the different objects studied throughout this paper and, moreover,\nhow they would uplift to M-theory, working along the lines of [29].\nThe MN construction of N = 1 Yang-Mills in the type IIB theory by wrapping D5-branes\nin a finite holomorphic two-cycle of a CY3 corresponds in the type IIA theory to D6 branes\nwrapping a SLag three cycle inside a CY3 , which, when going to eleven dimensions, gets\nuplifted to a G2 holonomy manifold. We have seen that codimension one objects preserving\ntwo supercharges can be added by including D5-branes wrapping a supersymmetric threecycle. In the type IIA theory, supersymmetric codimension one objects can be introduced\nby adding a D4-brane wrapping a holomorphic two-cycle (this is how domain walls are\nintroduced in N = 1 four dimensional field theories, see, for instance [30]) or by considering\na D6-brane wrapping a divisor four-cycle of the CY3 . This first configuration uplifts to a\nM5 wrapping an associative three cycle inside the G2 manifold, whereas the second yields\na cohomogeneity two Spin(7) holonomy manifold. The two cohomogeneous directions are\n23\n\n\fthe one corresponding to the energy scale and the distance to the defect. The codimension\ntwo objects, introduced by wrapping a D5-brane in a four-cycle yield D4-branes wrapping a\nsusy SLag three-cycle in the type IIA theory, which therefore uplift to a configuration where\nM5-branes wrap the coassociative four-cycle of the G2 manifold. Finally, notice that, if both\nkind of codimension one and two objects are parallel, they can be added simultaneously,\npreserving just one supercharge. The corresponding M-theory setup could consist of a stack\nof M5-branes wrapping a Cayley four-cycle inside the Spin(7) manifold described above. In\nthis case, both the codimension one and two objects are extended along the flat directions\ntransverse to the Spin(7) manifold.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to D. Are\u00e1n, R. Casero, J.

(2.13) and (2.14). In eq. (A.1) we have already taken\ninto account that we are considering configurations of the probe with vanishing worldvolume gauge field. For static embeddings, such as the ones obtained in the main text, the\nhamiltonian density H is just H = \u2212L. In this appendix we are going to verify that, for the\nsystems studied in sections 3 and 4, H satisfies a lower bound, which is saturated just when\nthe corresponding BPS equations are satisfied. Actually, we will verify that, for a generic\nembedding, H can be written as:\nH = Z +S ,\n(A.2)\nwhere Z is a total derivative and S is non-negative:\nS \u2265 0.\n\n(A.3)\n\nFrom eqs. (A.2) and (A.3) it follows immediately that H \u2265 Z, which is the energy bound\nwe are looking for. Moreover, we will check that S = 0 precisely when the BPS equations\n24\n\n\fobtained from kappa symmetry are satisfied, which means that the energy bound is saturated\nfor these configurations. These facts mean that the configurations we have found are not just\nsolutions of the equations of motion but BPS worldvolume solitons of the D5-brane probe\n[31].\n\nA.1\n\nEnergy bound for the wall solutions\n\nLet us consider a D5-brane probe in the non-abelian Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez background and let\nus choose the same worldvolume coordinates as in eq. (3.1) and the ansatz (3.2) for the\nembedding. For simplicity we will consider the angular embeddings \u03b82 (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) and \u03c62 (\u03b81 , \u03c61 )\nwritten in eq. (3.45) and we will consider a completely arbitrary function x3 (r). Using the\n\u221a\nvalue of \u2212g given in (3.63), one gets:\n2\u03c6\n\nH = \u2212L = e\n\nsin \u03b81\n\n\"\n\nq\nr\n\u03bbm \u2032\n( cosh 2r \u2212 \u03bbm ) 1 + (\u2202r x3 )2 \u2212\na \u2202r x3\nsinh 2r\n4\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere m = \u00b11 is the same as in eq. (3.45) and \u03bb = cos \u03c80 = \u00b11 (see eq. (3.61)). In order\nto write H as in eq. (A.2) , let us define the function\n\u0014\n\n\u039br \u2261 e\u2212h r coth 2r \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(A.5)\n\nNotice that the BPS equation for x3 (r) (eq.

Accordingly, let us choose\nworldvolume coordinates as in (4.1) and an embedding of the type displayed in eq. (4.2)\nin the non-abelian MN background, where, for simplicity, we will take the angle \u03c8 to be a\nconstant such that sin \u03c8 = 0 (see eq. (4.20)). In this case it is also easy to prove that the\nhamiltonian density can be written as in eq. (A.2), where for an arbitrary function r(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ),\nZ is a total derivative and S \u2265 0. In order to verify these facts, let us take Z to be:\nZ =\n\n\u0011\ni\nh\n\u0010\na2\ne2\u03c6\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 e2h \u2212 (\u2206\u03b81 \u2212 \u03bba\u2206\u03b82 )\u2202\u03b81 r \u2212 4 (e2h +\n) \u2206\u03b82 \u2212 \u03bba\u2206\u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 r .\n4\n4\n(A.14)\n\nOne can prove that Z is a total derivative. Indeed, let us introduce the functions z1 (r)\nand z2 (r) as the solutions of the equations:\ndz1\ne2\u03c6\n= cos \u03b1\n,\ndr\n8\nh\ni e2\u03c6\ndz2\n= \u2212 a cos \u03b1 + 2eh sin \u03b1\n,\ndr\n8\n\n(A.15)\n\nwhere h, \u03c6 and \u03b1, are the functions of the radial coordinate displayed in eqs. (2.4) and (2.9).\nThen, one can verify that Z = \u2202\u03b81 Z \u03b81 + \u2202\u03b82 Z \u03b82 , where\nZ \u03b81 = \u2212 cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 z1 + \u03bb sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 z2 ,\nZ \u03b82 = \u2212 sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82\n\nh\n\ni\ne2\u03c6+2h\n\u2212 z1 \u2212 \u03bb cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 z2 .\n4\n\n26\n\n(A.16)\n\n\fIn order to prove this result the following relation:\nd h 2\u03c6+2h i\n= 2re2\u03c6 ,\ne\ndr\n\n(A.17)\n\nis quite useful.\nIt is straightforward to prove that for these configurations the pullback of C (6) vanishes.\n\u221a\nTherefore (see eq.

In particular, we are interested\nin trying to obtain embeddings for which the angle \u03c8 is not constant. To insure this fact we\nwill include \u03c8 in our set of worldvolume coordinates. Actually, we will choose the \u03be's as:\n\u03be \u03bc = (x0 , x1 , x2 , \u03b82 , \u03c62, \u03c8) ,\n\n(B.1)\n\nand we will adopt the following ansatz for the embedding:\n\u03b81 = \u03b81 (\u03b82 ),\nx3 = x3 (\u03c8) ,\n\n\u03c61 = \u03c61 (\u03c62 ),\nr = r(\u03c8) .\n\n(B.2)\n\nFor these configurations the kappa symmetry matrix acts on the Killing spinors \u01eb as:\n1\n\u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u221a\n\u03b3 x 0 x 1 x 2 \u03b8 2 \u03c62 \u03c8 \u01eb .\n\u2212g\nNow the induced gamma matrices are:\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3x\u03bc = \u0393x\u03bc ,\n\n(\u03bc = 0, 1, 2),\n27\n\n(B.3)\n\n\f\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3\u03b82 = eh \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u03931 + W1\u03b8 \u0393\u03021 + W2\u03b8 \u0393\u03022 ,\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3\u03c62 = eh sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 \u03932 + W1\u03c6 \u0393\u03021 + W2\u03c6 \u0393\u03022 + W3\u03c6 \u0393\u03023 ,\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3\u03c8 =\n\n1\n\u0393\u03023 + \u2202\u03c8 r \u0393r + \u2202\u03c8 x3 \u0393x3 ,\n2\n\n(B.4)\n\nwhere the W 's are the following quantities:\nW1\u03b8 =\n\n1\n[cos \u03c8 + a\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 ] ,\n2\n\nW2\u03b8 = \u2212\n\nB.1.1\n\n1\nsin \u03c8 ,\n2\n\nW1\u03c6 =\n\n1\nsin \u03b82 sin \u03c8 ,\n2\n\nW2\u03c6 =\n\n1\n[ sin \u03b82 cos \u03c8 \u2212 a sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 ] ,\n2\n\nW3\u03c6 =\n\n1\n[cos \u03b82 + \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 cos \u03b81 ] .\n2\n\n(B.5)\n\nEmbeddings at r = 0\n\nLet us analyze first the possibility of taking in our previous equations r = 0 and an arbitrary\nconstant value of x3 . Since eh \u2192 0, a \u2192 1 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c60 when r \u2192 0, one has in this case\n\u03c60\n\u03c60\n\u03c60\n\u03b3\u03b82 = e 2 [W1\u03b8 \u0393\u03021 + W2\u03b8 \u0393\u03022 ], \u03b3\u03c62 = e 2 [W1\u03c6 \u0393\u03021 + W2\u03c6 \u0393\u03022 + W3\u03c6 \u0393\u03023 ] and \u03b3\u03c8 = e 2 \u0393\u03023 /2 and\none immediately gets:\n3\ni\ne 2 \u03c60 h\n\u03b3 \u03b8 2 \u03c62 \u03c8 \u01eb =\nsin \u03b82 + (sin \u03b82 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u2212 sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 ) cos \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 ) \u0393\u0302123 \u01eb .\n8\n\n(B.6)\nOn the other hand, it is easy to compute the value of the determinant of the induced metric\nfor an embedding of the type (B.2) at r = 0 and constant x3 . By using this result one readily\ngets the action of \u0393\u03ba on \u01eb. Indeed, let us define s(\u03b82 , \u03c62 , \u03c8) to be the following sign:\ni\n\nh\n\ns(\u03b82 , \u03c62 , \u03c8) \u2261 sign sin \u03b82 + (sin \u03b82 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u2212 sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 ) cos \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 ) .\nThen, one has:\n\n\u0393\u03ba \u01eb |r=0 = s \u0393x0 x1 x2 \u0393\u0302123 \u01eb |r=0 .\n\n(B.7)\n(B.8)\n\nIt follows that the condition \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb is equivalent to the projection:\n\u0393x0 x1 x2 \u0393\u0302123 \u01eb |r=0 = s \u01eb |r=0 .\n\n28\n\n(B.9)\n\n\fNotice that the right-hand side of (B.9) only depends on the angular part of the embedding\nthrough the sign s. Let us rewrite eq. (B.9) in terms of the spinor \u01eb0 defined in eq. (3.47).\nFirst of all, let us introduce the matrix \u0393\u0302\u2217 as:\n\u0393\u0302\u2217 = \u0393x0 x1 x2 \u03931 \u0393\u030223 .\n\n(B.10)\n\n\u03b1\n\nRecall from (3.47) that \u01eb = e 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u01eb0 . As \u03b1(r = 0) = \u2212\u03c0/2, see eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), the\nabove condition reduces to:\n\u0393\u0302\u2217 \u01eb0 = s \u01eb0 .\n(B.11)\nIt is easy to verify that this condition commutes with the projections satisfied by \u01eb0 , which\nare the same as those satisfied by the constant spinor \u03b7 (see eq. (2.11)). Moreover, it\nis readily checked that these configurations satisfy the equations of motion of the probe.\nNotice that the angular embedding is undetermined. However, the above projection only\nmakes sense if s(\u03b82 , \u03c62 , \u03c8) does not depend on the angles. Although the angular embedding\nis not uniquely determined, there are some embeddings that can be discarded. For example\nif we take \u03b81 = \u03b82 , \u03c61 = \u03c62 the corresponding three-cycle has vanishing volume and s is\nnot well-defined. For \u03b81 = constant, \u03c61 = constant one has s = 1. The same value of s is\nobtained if \u03b81 = \u03c0 \u2212\u03b82 , \u03c61 = \u03c62 or when \u03b81 = \u03b82 , \u03c61 = 2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c62 . Notice that this configuration\nconsists of a D5-brane, which is finite in the internal directions, wrapping the finite S 3 inside\nthe geometry, which has minimal volume at r = 0. This object is thought to correspond to\na domain wall of the field theory [16, 32]. However, the physics of domain walls is yet not\nfully understood in this model.\nB.1.2\n\nGeneral case\n\nLet us now come back to the general case. By using the relation between the spinors \u01eb and\n\u01eb0 , the kappa symmetry equation \u0393\u03ba \u01eb = \u01eb can be rephrased as the following condition on\nthe spinor \u01eb0 :\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ne\u2212 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u0393\u03ba e 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u01eb0 = \u01eb0 .\n(B.12)\nLet us evaluate the left-hand side of this equation by imposing the projection (B.11), i.e. the\nsame projection as the one satisfied by the supersymmetric configurations at r = 0. After\nsome calculation one gets an expression of the type:\n\u03b1\ne3\u03c6 h\n\u03b1\ne\u2212 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u0393\u03ba e 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u01eb0 = \u221a\ndI + d11\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 + d1\u03022\u0302 \u0393\u03021 \u0393\u03022 + d12\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03022 +\n\u2212g\n\ni\n\n+d2\u03023\u0302 \u0393\u03022 \u0393\u03023 + d23\u0302 \u03932 \u0393\u03023 + d1\u03023\u0302 \u0393\u03021 \u0393\u03023 + d13\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03023 \u01eb0 ,\n\n(B.13)\n\nwhere the d's depend on the embedding (see below). Clearly, in order to satisfy eq. (B.12)\nwe must require the conditions:\nd11\u0302 = d1\u03022\u0302 = d12\u0302 = d2\u03023\u0302 = d23\u0302 = d1\u03023\u0302 = d13\u0302 = 0 .\n\n(B.14)\n\nThe expressions of the d's are quite involved. In order to write them in a compact form let\nus define the quantities P1 , P2 and P3 as:\nP1 \u2261 W1\u03b8 W2\u03c6 \u2212 W1\u03c6 W2\u03b8 + e2h sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 ,\n29\n\n\f\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\nP2 \u2261 eh W2\u03c6 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 \u2212 W1\u03b8 sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61\nP3 \u2261 eh W1\u03c6 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 + W2\u03b8 sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61\n\n(B.15)\n\nThen the coefficients of the terms that do not contain the matrix \u0393\u03023 are:\ni\nh\ni\ns h\nP2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1 + P1 cos \u03b1 + P2 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 x3 + s P3 \u2202\u03c8 r ,\ndI =\n2\nd11\u0302 = \u2212\nd1\u03022\u0302 =\n\ni\nh\ni\ns h\nP1 cos \u03b1 + P2 sin \u03b1 + P2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 x3 ,\n2\n\nh\ni\ns\nP3 \u2212 s P2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 r ,\n2\nh\n\ni\n\nd12\u0302 = s P1 cos \u03b1 + P2 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 r \u2212 P3 \u2202\u03c8 x3 .\n\n(B.16)\n\nFrom the conditions d11\u0302 = d1\u03022\u0302 = 0 we get the BPS equations that determine \u2202\u03c8 x3 and \u2202\u03c8 r,\nnamely:\n\u2202\u03c8 x3 =\n\ns P1 cos \u03b1 + P2 sin \u03b1\n,\n2 P2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1\n\n\u2202\u03c8 r =\n\n1\nP3\n, .\n2 P2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1\n\n(B.17)\n\nwhile the equation d12\u0302 = 0 is satisfied if the differential equations (B.17) hold.\nThe expressions of the coefficients of the terms with the matrix \u0393\u03023 are:\nh\n\ni\n\nd2\u03023\u0302 = \u2212W3\u03c6 W1\u03b8 cos \u03b1 + eh \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 x3 ,\nd23\u0302 = W3\u03c6\n\nh\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\nW1\u03b8 sin \u03b1 \u2212 eh \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 cos \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 x3 \u2212 s W2\u03b8 \u2202\u03c8 r ,\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\nd1\u03023\u0302 = W3\u03c6 W2\u03b8 \u2202\u03c8 x3 \u2212 s eh \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 cos \u03b1 \u2212 W1\u03b8 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 r ,\nh\n\ni\n\nd13\u0302 = sW3\u03c6 W1\u03b8 cos \u03b1 + eh \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 sin \u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 r .\n\n(B.18)\n\nLet us impose now the vanishing of the coefficients (B.18). Clearly, this condition can\nbe achieved by requiring that r and x3 be constant. It is easy to see from the vanishing\nof the right-hand side of eq. (B.17) that this only happens at r = 0 and, therefore, the\nconfiguration reduces to the one studied above. Another possibility is to impose W3\u03c6 = 0,\nwhich is equivalent to the following differential equation:\n\u2212\n\ncos \u03b82\n= \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 .\ncos \u03b81\n\n(B.19)\n\nFor consistency, both sides of the equation must be equal to a constant which we will denote\nby m:\ncos \u03b82\n.\n(B.20)\n\u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 = m ,\ncos \u03b81 = \u2212\nm\n30\n\n\fMoreover, by differentiating the above relation between \u03b81 and \u03b82 , we immediately obtain:\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 = \u2212\n\nsin \u03b82\nsin \u03b82\n.\n= \u2212sign(m) q\nm sin \u03b81\nsin2 \u03b82 + m2 \u2212 1\n\n(B.21)\n\nMoreover, by using eqs. (B.20) and (B.21) one can easily find the following expression of the\nP's:\ni\n\u0010\n1 \u0011\n1h\nP1\n1 + a \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 +\ncos \u03c8 + a2 \u2212 e2h ,\n=\nsin \u03b82\n4\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81\n\ne\u2212h\n\nP2\n1 \u0011\n1\u0010\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 +\ncos \u03c8 + a ,\n=\nsin \u03b82\n2\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81\n\ne\u2212h\n\n1 \u0011\n1\u0010\nP3\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 +\nsin \u03c8 .\n=\nsin \u03b82\n2\n\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81\n\n(B.22)\n\nFor consistency with our ansatz, the right-hand side of the equation for \u2202\u03c8 r in (B.17)\nmust necessarily be independent of \u03b82 . By inspecting the right-hand side of (B.22) it is\nevident that this only happens if \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 is constant which, in view of eq. (B.21) can only\noccur if m2 = 1, i.e. when m = \u00b11. In this case \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 = \u2212m and the angular embedding is:\n\u03b81 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b82 ,\n\n\u03c61 = \u03c62 ,\n\n(m = +1) ,\n\n\u03c61 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c62 ,\n\n\u03b81 = \u03b82 ,\n\n(m = \u22121) .\n\n(B.23)\n\nNotice that the functions in (B.23) are just the same as those corresponding to the embeddings with constant \u03c8 (eq. (3.45)). Moreover, taking \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 = \u2212m in the expression of the\nPi 's in eq. (B.22), and substituting this result on the right-hand side of eq. (B.17), one finds\nthe following BPS differential equations for r(\u03c8) and x3 (\u03c8):\n\n\u2202\u03c8 r =\n\u2202\u03c8 x3 =\n\n1\nsinh(2r) sin \u03c8\n,\n2 cosh(2r) cos \u03c8 \u2212 m\n1 \u0011 cosh(2r) \u2212 m cos \u03c8\nsm \u2212h \u0010\nr coth(2r) \u2212\ne\n.\n2\n2 cosh(2r) cos \u03c8 \u2212 m\n\n(B.24)\n\nLets us now verify that the BPS equations written above are enough to guarantee that\n(B.12) holds. With this purpose in mind, let us compute the only non-vanishing term of the\nright-hand side of eq. (B.13), namely dI . By plugging the BPS equations (B.17) into the\nexpression of dI in eq. (B.16), one gets:\ndI\n\n|BP S\n\n= s\n\nP12 + P22 + P32\n.\nP2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1\n\nFrom eq. (B.25) one can check that:\n\u221a\n\u2212g |BP S = e3\u03c6 dI\n31\n\n|BP S\n\n.\n\n(B.25)\n\n(B.26)\n\n\fIn order to verify that the kappa symmetry condition (B.12) is satisfied we must check that\nthe sign of dI |BP S is positive. It can be verified that:\nh\n\nsign P2 cos \u03b1 \u2212 P1 sin \u03b1 ] |BP S = \u2212m sign(cos \u03c8) ,\n\n(B.27)\n\nand therefore (see eq. (B.25)), the condition sign (dI |BP S ) = +1 holds if the sign s of the\nprojection (B.11) is such that:\ns = \u2212m sign(cos \u03c8) .\n(B.28)\nThen, given an angular embedding (i.e. for a fixed value of m), we must restrict \u03c8 to a range\nin which the sign of cos \u03c8 does not change and the sign s of the projection must be chosen\naccording to (B.28). Moreover, one can show that the equations of motion are satisfied if\nthe first-order equations (B.24) hold.\nB.1.3\n\nIntegration of the BPS equations\n\nAfter a short calculation one can demonstrate that the equation for r(\u03c8) in (B.24) can be\nrewritten as:\nh\ni\n\u2202\u03c8 cos \u03c8 sinh(2r) \u2212 2mr = 0 .\n(B.29)\n\nIn this form the BPS equation for r(\u03c8) can be immediately integrated, namely:\ncos \u03c8 =\n\nC + 2mr\n,\nsinh(2r)\n\n(B.30)\n\nwhere C is a constant. Moreover, once the function r(\u03c8) is known, one can get x3 (\u03c8) by\ndirect integration of the right-hand side of the second equation in (B.24).\nLet us study the above solution for different signs of cos \u03c8. Consider first the region in\nwhich cos \u03c8 \u2265 0, which corresponds to \u03c8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] mod 2\u03c0. If the constant C > 0, let\nus represent it in terms of a new constant r\u2217 as C = sinh(2r\u2217 ) \u2212 2mr\u2217 . Then, the above\nsolution can be written as:\ncos \u03c8 =\n\nsinh(2r\u2217 ) + 2m(r \u2212 r\u2217 )\n,\nsinh(2r)\n\n(B.31)\n\nfrom which it is clear that r\u2217 is the value of r such that cos \u03c8 = 1. The functions r(\u03c8) for\nm = \u00b11 written in eq. (B.31), and the corresponding x3 (\u03c8), have been plotted in figure 2.\nIf m = +1, the solution (B.31) is such that r \u2192 \u221e and |x3 | \u2192 \u221e when \u03c8 \u2192 \u00b1\u03c0/2 mod 2\u03c0.\nHowever, if m = \u22121 the radial coordinate r grows from its minimal value r\u2217 at \u03c8 = 0 mod 2\u03c0\n\u2217)\nat \u03c8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2 mod 2\u03c0, while x3 (\u03c8) remains finite when\nto a maximal value r\u0302 = r\u2217 + sinh(2r\n2\n\u03c8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] mod 2\u03c0.\nIf C < 0, it is clear from (B.30) that, as we are considering the region cos \u03c8 \u2265 0, only\nthe solution with m = +1 is possible. Defining 2r\u0303 = \u2212C, the solution in this case can be\nwritten as\n2(r \u2212 r\u0303)\n,\n(m = +1).\n(B.32)\ncos \u03c8 =\nsinh(2r)\n\n32\n\n\f3\n\nX\n6\n\nr\n4\n\n2\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c8\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0/2 \u03c8\n\n-6\n\nFigure 2: The functions r(\u03c8) and x3 (\u03c8) for the solutions (B.31) in the interval \u03c8 \u2208\n[\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] mod 2\u03c0. The continuous line represents the embedding with m = +1, while\nthe dashed line corresponds to m = \u22121. In this latter case r(\u03c8) and x3 (\u03c8) remain finite,\nwhile for m = +1 they diverge at \u03c8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2.\nThis solution has two branches such that r \u2192 r\u0303, \u221e when \u03c8 \u2192 \u00b1\u03c0/2. Finally, if C = 0 only\nthe m = +1 solution makes sense. In this case the solution grows from r = 0 at \u03c8 = 0 to\nr = \u221e at \u03c8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2.\nIn the region cos \u03c8 \u2264 0, i.e. for \u03c8 \u2208 [\u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2] mod 2\u03c0, the solutions can be found from\nthose for cos \u03c8 \u2265 0 by means of the following symmetry of the solution (B.30):\n\u03c8 \u2192\u03c0\u2212\u03c8 ,\n\nC \u2192 \u2212C ,\n\nm \u2192 \u2212m .\n\n(B.33)\n\nThen, one can get solutions in the range \u03c8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] by joining one solution in the region\ncos \u03c8 \u2265 0 to the one obtained by means of the transformation (B.33). Notice that the resulting solutions preserve supersymmetry at the cost of changing the angular embedding, i.e.\nby making m \u2192 \u2212m, when the sign of cos \u03c8 changes. In particular, in the solution obtained\nfrom the one in (B.31) when m = \u22121 the coordinate r does not diverge. One can apply\nthis construction to a single brane probe with a singular embedding or, alternatively, one\ncan consider two different brane probes preserving the same supersymmetry with different\nangular embeddings and lying on disjoint regions of \u03c8.\n\nB.2\n\nTwo-dimensional defects\n\nIn analogy with what we have just done with the wall defect solitons, let us find some\ncodimension two embeddings of the D5-brane probe in which the angle \u03c8 is not constant.\nWe shall take the following set of worldvolume coordinates:\n\u03be \u03bc = (x0 , x1 , r, \u03b82 , \u03c62 , \u03c8) ,\n\n(B.34)\n\nand we will adopt an ansatz in which x2 and x3 are constant and\n\u03b81 = \u03b81 (\u03b82 ),\n\n\u03c61 = \u03c61 (\u03c62 ).\n\n33\n\n(B.35)\n\n\fThe induced gamma matrices \u03b3x\u03bc (\u03bc = 0, 1), \u03b3\u03b82 and \u03b3\u03c62 are exactly those written in eq.\n(B.4), while \u03b3r and \u03b3\u03c8 are given by:\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n1\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3r = \u0393r ,\n(B.36)\ne\u2212 2 \u03b3\u03c8 = \u0393\u03023 .\n2\nLet us try to implement the kappa symmetry condition in the form displayed in eq. (B.12).\nFor this case, the left-hand side of (B.12) can be written as:\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\ne\u2212 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u0393\u03ba e 2 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u01eb0 =\n\nh\ni\ne3\u03c6\n\u221a\n\u0393x0 x1 fI + f11\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03021 + f12\u0302 \u03931 \u0393\u03022 \u01eb0 ,\n2 \u2212g\n\n(B.37)\n\nwhere the f 's are expressed in terms of the Pi functions of (B.15) as:\nfI = cos \u03b1 P1 + sin \u03b1 P2 ,\n\nf11\u0302 = \u2212 sin \u03b1 P1 + cos \u03b1 P2 ,\nf12\u0302 = \u2212P3 .\n\n(B.38)\n\nSince the matrices \u03931 \u0393\u03021 and \u03931 \u0393\u03022 do not commute with the projection (3.48), it is clear that\nwe must impose:\nf11\u0302 = f12\u0302 = 0 .\n(B.39)\nFrom the condition f11\u0302 = 0, we get:\n\nwhile f12\u0302\n\nP2\n= tan \u03b1 ,\nP1\n= 0 is equivalent to the vanishing of P3 , which implies:\nsin \u03b82 \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 = sin \u03b81 \u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 .\n\n(B.40)\n\n(B.41)\n\nBy using this condition for the angular part of the embedding, we can write the ratio between\nthe functions P1 and P2 as:\nP2\nr sin \u03b1 (\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 )2\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011 .\n=\n2\nP1\nr cos \u03b1 + e2h \u2212 a4 (\u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 )2 \u2212 1\n\n(B.42)\n\nThe consistency between the expressions (B.40) and (B.42) requires that \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 = \u00b11. Moreover, by separating variables in the angular embedding equation (B.41) one concludes that\n\u2202\u03c62 \u03c61 = m , with m constant. Proceeding as in the previous subsection, one easily verifies\nthat the only consistent solutions of (B.41) with \u2202\u03b82 \u03b81 constant are:\n\u03b81 = \u03b82 ,\n\n\u03c61 = \u03c62 ,\n\n(m = +1) ,\n\n\u03b81 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b82 ,\n\n\u03c62 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c61 ,\n\n(m = \u22121) .\n\n(B.43)\n\nNotice the difference between (B.43) and (B.23). One can verify that this embedding is a\n\u221a\nsolution of the equations of motion of the probe. Moreover, by computing \u2212g and fI for\nthe embeddings (B.43), one readily proves that the kappa symmetry condition is equivalent\nto the following projection on \u01eb0 :\n(B.44)\n\u0393x0 x1 \u01eb0 = \u01eb0 .\n34\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.
