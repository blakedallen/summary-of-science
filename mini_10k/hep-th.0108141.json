This leads to the demonstration that certain features of the QCD partition function are\nuniversal.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn recent years the spectral correlators of the Dirac operator in QCD have been the object of intense\nstudy using both numerical and analytic means. These correlators contain valuable information regarding both the chiral properties of the QCD vacuum and the topological structure of the gauge\nfields. The relation to the chiral properties of the QCD vacuum was established by Banks and Casher\n[1]: The eigenvalue density of the QCD Dirac operator at eigenvalue zero is proportional to the chiral\ncondensate and is therefore an appropriate order parameter for chiral symmetry. As a complement\nto the Banks-Casher relation, one has the Yang-Lee picture [2] of a phase transition. In the attempt\nto analyze phase transitions in statistical spin models Lee and Yang [2] introduced the concept of the\nzeros of the finite volume partition function in the thermodynamic limit. The volume dependence of\nthese zeros allows finite size scaling studies and subsequent identification of universality classes. In the\ncase of chiral symmetry, one focuses on the zeros of the partition function in the complex quark mass\nplane. If these zeros pinch the real axis and exhibit a constant density, a discontinuity in the partition\nfunction arises at the pinch, and chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. The mass zeros of the\npartition function and the low lying eigenvalues of the Dirac operator thus contain similar information\nabout the chiral phase transition. The relation between the two is, however, involved. The partition\nfunction and its zeros are obtained by averaging over all gauge field configurations. By contrast, the\neigenvalues of the Dirac operator are given for each gauge field configuration, and only a density of\neigenvalues is well-defined after averaging.\nThe challenge of deriving relations between the zeros of the partition function and the eigenvalues\nof the Dirac operator was first taken up by Leutwyler and Smilga [3]. They studied QCD in a Euclidean\n4-dimensional box with side length L subject to the constraint that\n1\n1\n\u226aL\u226a\n.\n\u039b\nm\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nHere m\u03c0 is the pion mass and \u039b is the typical QCD scale. They computed the QCD partition function\nfor equal quark masses using the effective chiral Lagrangian and found that quark masses enter only\nin the rescaled combination m L4 \u03a3, where \u03a3 is the chiral condensatein the chiral limit. They further\nobserved that the partition function zeros could be thought of as average positions of the eigenvalues.\nWhile highly suggestive, these results were not completely quantitative. The situation has changed\ndramatically since then. The main break through came with the introduction [4] of random matrix\nconcepts in QCD which permits the study of the correlations of the eigenvalues of matrices drawn\non a general weight constructed to ensure the chiral structure of each eigenvalue spectrum. The\nrelation of random matrix theory to QCD in the limit (1) has been established through a number\nof universality studies [5], lattice QCD simulations [6],[7], and direct calculations using the effective\nchiral Lagrangian [8]. (For a review of random matrix theory in QCD see [9].) In terms of the spectral\ncorrelation functions, the universal limit in which QCD and chiral random matrix theory (\u03c7RMT)\ncoincide is the limit\nN \u2192\u221e, \u03bb\u21920, m\u21920,\n(2)\nin which the microscopic variables\n\u03b6 \u2261 2N \u03bb ,\n\n\u03bc \u2261 2N m\n\n(3)\n\nare kept fixed and N is identified as the dimensionless volume. (Here, \u03bb denotes an eigenvalue of\nthe Dirac operator and m is the dimensionless quarkmass parameter.) The determination of the\nindividual eigenvalue distributions and their most important correlators now permits direct comparison\nof partition function zeros and eigenvalue positions. The suggestion of Leutwyler and Smilga is\nremarkably accurate. The zeros and the average positions of the eigenvalues are intimately connected.\n2\n\n\fHere we shall demonstrate that this relationship can be understood as a fundamental property\nof the chiral ensembles. We show that the zeros are uniquely trapped by the maxima of the joint\neigenvalue distribution function. This trapping appears on all scales and is thus relevant for any\nfinite N as well as in the large N limit. To obtain a better understanding of the relation between\nthe maxima of the joint eigenvalue distribution function and the zeros of the partition function, we\nintroduce and determine the spectral \"normal modes\" of the chiral unitary ensemble. This provides\nus with a simple tool to describe the fluctuations of the eigenvalues about the maximum of the joint\neigenvalue distribution.\nAs suggested in (1), chiral random matrix theory is not expected to describe all aspects of QCD.\nOnly correlations below a certain energy length are expected to be in agreement with chiral random\nmatrix theory [10]. In solid state physics, this energy is denoted as the Thouless energy. Recently [11]\nit was realized that the effects of a finite Thouless energy can be studied naturally using the language\nof spectral normal modes [12]. We thus perform a normal mode analyses of the chiral ensemble to\nformulate and establish certain universal features of the partition function zeros. This argument is\nindependent of standard proofs of universality, and its general nature can shed some light on the way\nuniversality is realized.\nIn section 2 we show that for Nf = 1 the zeros of the partition function of \u03c7RMT are trapped\nbetween the maximum positions of the joint distribution function. This result holds for all scales. In\nsection 3 we derive the normal modes of the chiral unitary ensembles and find that they are Chebyshev\npolynomials in the large N limit. We discuss the effects of the Thouless energy in section 4. In section\n5 we make the connection to the familiar microscopic spectral density. Our conclusions are contained\nin section 6.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nZeros of the partition function in \u03c7RMT\nChiral random matrix theory\n\nWe start with the partition function of chiral random matrix theory (\u03c7RMT) for Nf flavors, which is\ngiven by [4, 13]\nNf ,\u03bd\n({mf })\nZN,\u03b2\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nNf\nY\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nN \u03b2 \u03a32\nTr(W \u2020 W ) ,\ndet(D + mf ) exp \u2212\nDW\n2\nf =1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b2 denotes the Dyson index and DW is the Haar measure over the Gaussian distributed random\nmatrices W . D is the analogue of the Dirac operator which has the chiral structure\nD=\n\n0\niW\niW \u2020 0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nHere W is a N \u00d7 M matrix with \u03bd = |N \u2212 M | playing the r\u00f4le of the topological charge. Without\nloss of generality we assume \u03bd to be positive. The chiral condensate in the chiral limit, \u03a3, is related\nto the eigenvalue density of D, \u03c1(\u03bb), via the Banks\u2013Casher relation [1]\n\u03a3 = lim lim\n\nlim\n\n\u03bb\u21920 mf \u21920 N \u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c0 \u03c1(\u03bb)\n.\nN\n\n(6)\n\nThe partition function is invariant under transformations W \u2192 U \u2020 W V , where U is a N \u00d7 N matrix\nand V a M \u00d7 M matrix. Following the diagonalization W = U \u2020 \u039bV , the partition function can be\n3\n\n\fexpressed in terms of the eigenvalues of W (with \u03a3 \u2261 1),\nNf ,\u03bd\n({mf })\nZN,\u03b2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n=\uf8ed\n\nNf\nY\n\nf =1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n|\u03bd|\nmf \uf8f8\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n...\n\nZ\n\nN\n+\u221e Y\n\n\u2212\u221e k=1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0d\u03bbk\n\nNf\nY\n\n\u2212 N\u03b2\n\u03bb2k\n2\n\n(\u03bb2k + m2f )\u03bbk\u03b2\u03bd+\u03b2\u22121 e\n\nf =1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb \u2206(\u03bb2 )\u03b2 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe Vandermonde determinant, \u2206(\u03bb2 ), which is the non-trivial Jacobian of the transformation from\nthe matrices to the eigenvalues, has the form\n\u2206(\u03bb2 ) =\n\nY\n\nk<l\n\n(\u03bb2k \u2212 \u03bb2l ) .\n\n(8)\n\nThe partition function (7) can now be written as an integral over the joint probability density\nNf ,\u03bd\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ; {mf }) as\nPN,\u03b2\nNf ,\u03bd\n({mf })\nZN,\u03b2\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\uf8eb\n\nNf\nY\n\n...\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\nN\n+\u221e Y\n\n\u2212\u221e k=1\n\nN ,\u03bd\n\nf\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ; {mf })\nd\u03bbk PN,\u03b2\n\n(9)\n\nwith\nN ,\u03bd\n\nf\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ; {mf }) = \uf8ed\nPN,\u03b2\n\nf =1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n|\u03bd|\nmf \uf8f8\n\nN\nY\n\nk=1\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\nNf\nY\n\n\u03bb2k\n\u2212 N\u03b2\n2\n\n(\u03bb2k + m2f )\u03bbk\u03b2\u03bd+\u03b2\u22121 e\n\nf =1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb \u2206(\u03bb2 )\u03b2 .\n\n(10)\n\nUnlike real QCD, \u03c7RMT has the special feature that the partition function can be expressed in terms\nof the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. This enables us to derive a number of statements regarding\nthe zeros of the partition function. We now focus on the case \u03b2 = 2 - the universality class of QCD\nwith 3 colours and quarks in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. (The choice \u03b2 = 1\ncorresponds to QCD with two colours in the fundamental representation; \u03b2 = 4 describes QCD with\nany number of flavours and quarks in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.)\nEq. (10) expresses an evident duality between flavor and topology: The joint probability density\nfor Nv massless flavours and Nf massive flavours depends only on \u03bd + Nv . This relation was proven\nfor the QCD partition function independent of \u03c7RMT in [14].\nWe now wish to determine the maximum of the joint probability distribution. This will allow us\nto put a tight bound on the zeros of the partition function. The chiral normal modes, to be discussed\nin section 3, describe fluctuations about the maximum of the joint probability distribution.\n\n2.2\n\nExtremum of the joint probability distribution\n\nIn order to determine the maximum of the joint eigenvalue probability distribution, we consider\nN ,\u03bd\nvariations of logPN f with respect to the eigenvalues. (We assume the eigenvalues to be ordered with\n\u03bbi < \u03bbi+1 .)

Specifically, we now show that the locations of the partition function zeros in\n\u03c7RMT are trapped by the maxima of the joint distribution function.\nThe Laguerre polynomials L\u03b1n (z) are polynomials orthogonal on the interval [0, \u221e] with weight\nfunction w(z) = z \u03b1 exp(\u2212z). They have three properties which are useful for our purpose:\n5\n\n\f\u2022 For orthogonal polynomials in general, the zeros of the N \u2212th order polynomial and the endpoints of the weight function define N +1 intervals. Exactly one zero of the orthogonal polynomial\nof order (N + 1) lies in each of these intervals.\n\u2022 For fixed N , the ith zero of the Laguerre polynomial, LaN (x) = 0, is a monotonically increasing\nfunction of a, thus\ndxi\n>0.\n(21)\nda\n\u2022 The generalized Laguerre polynomials are related to one another via\nLa+1\nN (x) = \u2212\n\ndLaN +1 (x)\n.\ndx\n\n(22)\n\nIn the last section we saw that the massless joint distribution function has its maxima when the\n\u22121/2\neigenvalues are located at the zeros of LN (N \u03bb2 ) and that the partition function for Nf = 1 and\n\u03bd = 0 is proportional to L0N (\u2212N m2 ). We are interested in relating the zeros of the partition function\nto the position of the eigenvalues at the maximum of the joint distribution function. Since the zeros\nof L0N (\u2212N m2 ) follow from those of L0N (N m2 ) by a rotation from the real to the imaginary axes in m,\nwe restrict our attention in the following considerations to Laguerre polynomials of positive argument.\nN =1,\u03bd=0\nIt follows from (21) that the zeros of ZN f\nare trapped between the corresponding zeros of\n\u22121/2\n+1/2\n1/2\n\u22121/2\nLN\nand LN . According to (22), the zeros of LN lie at the extrema of LN +1 . The extrema of\n\u22121/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\nLN +1 are evidently trapped by the zeros of LN\n\n(and the end points, if necessary). The result is that\n\u22121/2\n\nL0N\n\nand, given the nature of the\nthe ith zero of\nis trapped between the ith and (i + 1)st zero of LN\nN =1,\u03bd=0\nargument, is expected to be closer to the lower value. In other words, the zeros of ZN f\n(m) are\nNf =0,\u03bd=0\ntrapped by the most probable values for the eigenvalues of PN\n. This result is an exact property\nof the chiral unitary ensembles and is consequently valid on every scale including the microscopic scale.\nThe trapping just derived relates the zeros of the Nf = 1 partition function and the location\nof the maximum in the joint eigenvalue distribution of the quenched (Nf = 0) ensemble. We can\nalso relate the zeros of the Nf = 1 partition function to the maximum of its own integration kernel,\nN =1,\u03bd\nN =1,\u03bd\nN =0,\u03bd+1\nPN f\n({\u03bbi }, m). For m \u2192 0 we have PN f\n({\u03bbi }, m) = PN f\n({\u03bbi }) by flavor-topology duality.\nNf =0,\u03bd\nThe other limit, m \u2192 \u221e, decouples one flavor and leaves PN\n. So, with increasing m, the extrema\nNf =1,\u03bd\nNf =0,\u03bd+1\nN =0,\u03bd\nof PN\n(m) move smoothly from those of PN\nto those of PN f\n, i.e. from the zeros of\n\u03bd+1/2\n\u03bd\u22121/2\n. By (21), they must pass the zeros of the partition function L\u03bdN for some\nto the zeros of LN\nLN\nintermediates values of the mass m. The relation between the collective maximum of logP and the\naverage eigenvalue positions will be reconsidered in section 5.\n\n3\n\nNormal modes in \u03c7RMT\n\nWe have seen that the maximum of the massless joint distribution function is obtained when the\neigenvalues are located at the zeros of the Laguerre polynomials. In order to study the properties of\nN =0,\u03bd\nwhich\nfluctuations about this maximum, it is useful to make a Gaussian approximation to PN f\nleads to the form\n1\nN =0,\u03bd\nNf =0,\u03bd\n(23)\nlog PN f\n\u2248 log PN ;(0)\n+ \u03b4\u03bbi Cij \u03b4\u03bbj ,\n2\n\n6\n\n\fwhere \u03b4\u03bbi is the position of the ith eigenvalue relative to \u03bb\u0304i , its value at the collective maximum of\nN =0,\u03bd\nlog PN f\n. The matrix C is defined as\nCij =\n\n\u22022\nN =0,\u03bd\n,\nlog PN f\n\u2202\u03bbi \u2202\u03bbj\n\n(24)\n\nevaluated at the maximum. Concentrating again on the case Nf = 0, we find that the diagonal\nelements of C are\nX (\u03bb2i + \u03bb2j )\n2\u03bd + 1\n\u2212\n4\nCii = \u22122N \u2212\n,\n(25)\n\u03bb2i\n(\u03bb2i \u2212 \u03bb2j )2\nj6=i\nand that the off-diagonal elements are\nCij =\n\n8\u03bbi \u03bbj\n.\n\u2212 \u03bb2j )2\n\n(26)\n\n(\u03bb2i\n\nWe now consider the eigenvalue equation for the real symmetric matrix C:\nN\nX\n\n(k)\n\nCij \u03c6j\n\n(k)\n\n= \u03c9k \u03c6i\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\ni=1\n\nThe eigenvectors, \u03c6(k) , are the (normalized) normal modes of the \u03c7RMT spectrum. They describe the\nstatistically independent correlated fluctuations of the eigenvalues of the random matrix about their\nmost probable values. The normal modes provide an alternate description of the eigenvalues of any\ngiven random matrix since\n\u03b4\u03bbi =\n\nN\nX\n\n(k)\nck \u03c6i\n\nwith\n\nN\nX\n\n(k) (k \u2032 )\n\n\u03c6i \u03c6i\n\n= \u03b4kk\u2032 .\n\n(28)\n\ni=1\n\nk=1\n\nWe can locate the eigenvalues by specifying either the \u03b4\u03bbi or the amplitudes ck as convenient. The\neigenvalues, \u03c9k , provide a measure of the magnitude of these fluctuations.\nThe derivation of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be performed as in [12]. The resulting\neigenvalues are\n\u03c9k = \u22124 k N .\n(29)\nAs in [12], we find a linear dispersion relation valid for all k and N . The linearity of (29) is a reflection\nof the well-known rigidity of random matrix spectra. Furthermore, this result is independent of \u03bd.\nJust as in the Gaussian case, the eigenvectors are found to be Chebyshev polynomials in the large N\nlimit (i.e., with corrections of order 1/N ):\n(k)\n\u03c6i\n\n=\n\nr\n\n\u03bbi\n2\nU2k\u22121\nN\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nThe normalization of the eigenvectors is\nZ\n\ndx\u03c1(x)\u03c6(k) (x)\u03c6(l) (x) = \u03b4kl ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03c1(x) is again the semicircle\n\u03c1(x) =\n\nNp\n4 \u2212 x2 .\n\u03c0\n7\n\n(32)\n\n\fNote that only odd normal Chebyshev polynomials appear. This is a consequence of chiral symmetry,\nwhich ensures that all non-zero eigenvalues come in pairs (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb). Equation (23) can now be written\nas\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nNf =0,\u03bd\nN\nP\n1X\nlog \uf8ed NN =0,\u03bd \uf8f8 =\n|ck |2 \u03c9k .\n(33)\nf\n2\nP\nk=1\nN ;(0)\n\nFollowing (28), the coefficients ck are constructed as\nN\nX\n\nck =\n\n(k)\n\n\u03b4\u03bbi \u03c6i\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\ni=1\n\nand are statistically independent. It is obvious from (33) that that the mean square amplitude for the\nkth normal mode is\n1\nhc2k i =\n.\n(35)\n|\u03c9k |\n\nWe can use the normal modes to construct a Gaussian approximation to the partition function as\nN =1,\u03bd\nZN f\n(m)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nN\n\u221e Y\n\nN\n1X\ndck exp \u2212\n|ck |2 |\u03c9k | (m2 + (\u03bb\u0304k + \u03b4\u03bbk )2 ) ,\n2\nk=1\nk=1\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(36)\n\nwith the \u03bb\u0304k given by (13) and \u03b4\u03bbk given by (28). The Gaussian approximation (33) also permits a\nsimple approximate calculation of the number variance [12]. This calculation reveals that the familiar\nlogarithmic behaviour of the number variance (i.e., the \"spectral rigidity\" of the random matrix\nensembles) is a direct consequence of the linearity of the dispersion relation (29) for all k.\nWe have chosen to consider the normal modes for the case Nf = 0 and \u03bd = 0. This choice is some\nwhat arbitrary; it would be equally sensible to start with the Nf = 0 and \u03bd = 1 normal modes. We\nwill employ this Gaussian approximation below to consider the sensitivity of the partition function\nzeros to the effects of a Thouless energy. Since the resulting shifts are small, this arbitrariness will be\nof no consequence.\n\n4\n\nEffects of a Thouless energy\n\nNormal modes describe the correlated fluctuations of eigenvalues about their most probable values.\nAs we have seen (29), the normal modes for \u03c7RMT obey a linear dispersion relation. By contrast,\nuncorrelated eigenvalues obey a quadratic dispersion relation, and the mean square amplitude of the\nlowest mode with k = 1 is larger by a factor of N/k [12]. In QCD, it is expected that spectral\ncorrelations in a sufficiently small energy domain will follow the predictions of \u03c7RMT. On larger\nenergy scales, spectral correlations die out. The characteristic energy which divides these regions is\nthe Thouless energy, usually denoted by Ec . In 4-dimensional QCD the Thouless energy is estimated\nto be [10]\n\u221a\n(37)\nEc /D \u223c N ,\nwhere D is the mean level spacing. This behaviour has been verified in lattice studies [18]. The\nconnection between the Thouless energy and the normal modes of the eigenvalue spectrum has been\ninvestigated in [11] for the case of sparse matrices. There it was found that \"almost all\" normal\nmodes obey the linear dispersion relation discussed above with remarkable\naccuracy. Reflecting the\n\u221a\npresence of a Thouless energy, a small fraction (i.e., approximately 1/ N ) of long wave length modes\nare strongly enhanced. The mean square amplitude of the longest wave length mode with k = 1\napproaches the value appropriate for uncorrelated eigenvalues. Since such enhancement can be readily\n8\n\n\fincorporated in our Gaussian approximation to the partition function (36), normal modes provide\nus with a natural and convenient tool to study the effects of a Thouless energy on the zeros of the\npartition function. So far we have seen that the most probable eigenvalues are located at the zeros of\n\u22121/2\nand that the zeros of the partition function are given by the zeros of\nthe Laguerre polynomial LN\nL0N . The Gaussian approximation (36) allows us to see how this result is modified by the presence of\na Thouless energy. To mimic the effects of the Thouless energy, we shall enhance the long wavelength\nmodes in the partition function.\nOur aim is to demonstrate that the zeros of the partition function in the microscopic region remain\nvirtually unaffected even if the enhancement of the soft modes is substantial. Since we are concerned\nonly with the microscopic zeros, every long wavelength mode contributes to a \"breathing\" of the\nspectrum. In order to investigate the influence of the soft modes, it is sufficient to evaluate the\nstrength (i.e., mean square amplitude)\n\u221a of this effective breathing.\nFor concreteness we start with N longest wavelengths modes with fluctuations as given by the\nN =0,\u03bd=0\nGaussian approximation. Let \u03bb\u0304i denote the values\u221aat the maximum of PN f\n. The fluctuations\nintroduced in the Gaussian approximation by the N longest wavelengths modes are\n\u221a\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb\u0304i \u2212\u2192 \u03bb\u0304i \uf8ed1 +\n\nFrom (30) we know that the normal modes are\n\u03b7\n\n(k)\n\n=\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\np\n\nr\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b7 (k) ck \uf8f8 \u2261 \u03bb\u0304i s .\n\n(38)\n\n2/N U2k\u22121 (\u03bbi /2). This gives for the linear coefficient\n\n2\nk (\u22121)k+1 .\nN\n\n(39)\n\nAdditionally we know from (26) that the normal modes are linearly independent. With this information\nthe variance of s becomes in leading order of 1/N\n\u221a\n\nhs2 i \u2212 hsi2 = hs2 i \u2212 1 \u223c\n\n\u221a\n\nN\nX\nk2\n\nk=1\n\nN\n1\n1 X\n1 \u221a \u221a\n1\n= 2\n.\nk = 2 N ( N + 1) \u223c\nN kN\nN k=1\nN\nN\n\n(40)\n\nHere we used the facts that the linear terms vanish and that hc2k i = 1/|\u03c9k | with (29) for the quadratic\nterms. The result is simply a O(1/N ) correction.\nIn order\n\u221a to study the effects of a Thouless energy, we now enhance the mean square amplitudes\nof these N soft modes by a factor of N/k2 . This factor provides a smooth\n\u221a interpolation from the\nbehaviour of uncorrelated soft modes (for k = 1) to that of \u03c7RMT (for k = N ). This interpolation\nis completely consistent with the results of [11]. We now find that\n\u221a\n\nhs2 i \u2212 hsi2 \u223c\n\nN 2\nX\nk\n\nk=1\n\n1 N\nlog(N )\n\u223c\n.\n2\nN kN k\n2N\n\n(41)\n\n\u221a\nThe result still shows strong suppression in N . The decision to single out N soft modes for enhancement is not essential. We could declare any fraction of the long wave length modes which vanishes\nin the N \u2192 \u221e limit as \"soft\". A similar interpolation between the limits of uncorrelated and \u03c7RMT\nmodes will always lead to a value of hs2 i \u2212 1 which vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e. In short, the effects of a\nThouless energy are expected to have a negligible effect on h\u03bb2i i over the entire microscopic spectrum.\nThe question is now how we can evaluate the effect on the zeros from the enhanced long wave\nlength modes. To this end we introduce the distribution function of the fluctuations\nPN (s) \u2261\n\n1 \u03b3 \u2212 s22\ns e 2\u03c3\nN\n9\n\n(42)\n\n\fand fix \u03b3 and \u03c3 by the value of hs2 i found above. N is the normalization. In the RMT case we have\n\u03b3 = N/2 \u2212 1 and \u03c3 2 = 2(N + 1)/N 2 , while in the case where the long wavelength modes are enhanced\nwe have \u03b3 = N/log(N ) \u2212 \u221a\n1 and \u03c3 2 = log(N )(1 + log(N )/(2N ))/N .\nThe effect\u221aof the first N normal modes is different for large and small eigenvalues. Whereas for\nthe smallest N eigenvalues it amounts to a breathing it means incoherent fluctuations for the larger\nones. We now evaluate the effect of this breathing on the microscopic zeros. Recall that the partition\nfunction for Nf = 1 and \u03bd = 0 is the average of the fermionic determinant with respect to the joint\nQ\n\u22121/2\n2\n2\n(N m2 ). In the microscopic limit where the\nprobability distribution, and that N\ni=1 (m \u2212 \u03bbi ) = LN\nquantity \u03bc \u2261 2 N m is fixed we have\n\u22121/2\nLN\n\n\u03bc2\n4N s2\n\n!\n\n=\n\n(\u22121)N\nH2N\nN !22N\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u221a\n2 Ns\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u221a\n\n\u03bc\n1\ncos\ns\nN\u03c0\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\nTo\n\u221a investigate the correction to the microscopic partition function zeros under the influence of the\nN longest wavelength normal modes we thus have to consider the following integral\n1\nZ(\u03bc) \u223c\nNK\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ns2\nds exp \u03b3 log s \u2212 2\n2\u03c3\n\n!\n\ncos\n\n\u221a\n\nN\n\n.\n\nwhere the normalization factor K is\nK=\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nds PN (s) s2\n\n\u03bc\ns\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n\u221a\n\ns2\n\nN\n\n,\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\nThe factor s2 N comes from the rescaling in the fermionic determinant.

In both cases the zeros of the partition function are unaffected in the microscopic limit.\nThese results suggest a new kind of \"universality\" of the microscopic partition function. \u221aAs\na specific example this universality shows that the microscopic zeros are unaffected even if the N\nlongest wavelength normal modes are enhanced in such a way that they interpolate between Poissonian\nand RMT statistics.\n\u0012\n\n\u0014\n\n5\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\nThe microscopic limit\n\nSo far we have been discussing the joint distribution function, the zeros of the partition function,\nand the N positions that specify the collective maximum.

The extrema\nof (51) are given by\n(N =1,\u03bd)\n\u2202\u03c1s f\n(\u03b6; \u03bc)\n=0,\n(52)\n\u2202\u03b6\nand are obviously functions of \u03bc. If the derivative in (52) is evaluated at \u03b6 = \u03bc then the solutions\n(N =1,\u03bd)\nof (52) corresponding to the maxima of \u03c1s f\ncoincide with the zeros of the Nf = 1 microscopic\nN\n=1,\u03bd\nf\npartition function, Z\n(m), for an imaginary argument. To conclude: The peaks of the microscopic\neigenvalue density are in one to one correspondence with the zeros of the partition function and by the\ntrapping proven in section 2.3 also to the positions which maximize the joint probability distribution.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nIn the present paper we have established an intimate relationship between zeros of the partition\nfunction and the spectral properties of the Dirac operator. The relation is derived within chiral\nrandom matrix theory and applies to QCD Dirac spectra and partition function zeros near the origin\n(in the microscopic regime). Through the introduction of spectral normal modes we have tested the\nvalidity of the relationship when a finite Thouless energy is introduced. The observed independence\nof the microscopic zeros compliments the existing universality studies. The present study treats one\nflavour. For more flavours with degenerate masses, it is known that the zeros of the microscopic\npartition function are not confined to the imaginary axis [22]. While this makes the relation between\nthe eigenvalues and the zeros somewhat less direct, there is no reason to expect that the normal mode\nanalyis should not apply for any number of flavours.\nWe remark that the normal mode analysis is generically applicable and not a special feature of\nrandom matrix theory. In particular, the normal mode analysis lends itself to a study of the spectral\nproperties of the Dirac operator in lattice QCD. Such a study would be truly interesting in that it\nwould shed new light on the role of random matrix like correlations in lattice gauge theories. Almost\nall of the normal modes are expected to be given by random matrix theory while only the very long\nwavelength modes are determined by the detailed dynamics.\nIn a broader perspective this study may also be seen as the first step towards the establishment of\na one-to-one correspondence between the zeros and the most likely eigenvalue positions whenever the\nshort range spectral correlations are random matrix like. If such a general relation were established\nthen it could be used to argue that the critical exponents for the Yang-Lee edge in QCD must coincide\n11\n\n\fwith the ones for the gap in the spectral density of the Dirac operator. Such relationship, if true, would\nallow for substantial simplifications when trying to determine critical exponents by lattice techniques.\nAcknowledgments:\nThe authors wants to thank Poul Henrik Damgaard and Thomas Wilke for useful discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
