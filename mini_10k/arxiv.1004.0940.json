Introduction\nThe property of approximate transitivity (AT) has been introduced to ergodic\ntheory by Connes and Woods [5] in 1985 in connection with their measure-theoretic\ncharacterization of ITPFI hyperfinite factors in the theory of von Neumann algebras. Since then the approximately transitive dynamical systems have been objects\nof study in several papers, e.g. [1], [9], [12], [13], [15], [16], [21]. All systems with\nthe AT property have zero entropy [5], [8] and it is only recently [1], [9] that explicit\nexamples of zero entropy systems without AT property have been discovered.\nIn view of the form of its definition (see below) the AT property seems to be\nrelated to spectral properties, or more precisely to the spectral multiplicity of the\nmeasure-preserving system. Indeed, it was already in the 1990. when J.-P. Thouvenot using some generic type arguments observed that the AT property implies\nthe existence of a cyclic vector in the L1 -space of the underlying dynamical system.\nMoreover, a certain modification of the definition of the AT property (in which we\nreplace L1 -norms by L2 -norms) which was done in [16] implies L2 -simplicity of the\nspectrum. However, in general it is still an interesting open problem whether the\noriginal AT property implies simplicity of L2 -spectrum, i.e. simplicity of the spectrum of the classical Koopman representation of the dynamical system. Moreover,\nas noticed for example in [9], neither the other implication was known to hold. The\naim of this note is to answer this latter question \u2013 we give examples of systems with\nare not AT but have simple L2 -spectrum.\nOne more motivation for this note is the problem of a measure-theoretic characterization of simplicity of L2 -spectrum. This problem has a long history in ergodic\ntheory, see for example [19], [20] and the references therein and our examples bring\nthe answer to one more open question (stated explicitly in case of Z-actions in [11]\nas well as in [9]): namely we give the negative answer to the question whether the\nclass of funny rank one systems [10], [18] coincides with the class of systems with\nsimple L2 -spectrum; indeed a funny rank one system enjoys the AT property (see\nbelow).\nWe would like however to emphasize that in the note we do not consider Z-actions\nwhich are the most popular objects of study in ergodic theory, and therefore the\nproblems we mentioned above stay open for the class of Z-actions (and actions\nof many other groups). The systems which are considered below are\nactions of\nL\u221e\nsome torsion Abelian countable discrete groups. More precisely G = n=0 Z/pn Z\nwhere (pn )n\u22650 is an increasing sequence of primes numbers. We will then deal\nwith so called Morse extensions given by some special Z/2Z-valued cocycles over\na discrete spectrum action of G studied by M. Guenais in [14] (in that paper she\nproved that the resulting G-actions have Haar component of multiplicity one in\nthe L2 -spectrum). All such systems have simple spectrum. We will show that for\neach sufficiently fast choice of parameters in Guenais' construction we can apply\nthe criterion of being non-AT system formulated in [1] (this criterion is an elaborated version of the method already used in [9]). More precisely, we will prove the\nfollowing.\nL\u221e\nTheorem 1.1. Assume that G = n=0 Z/pn Z with (pn )n\u22650 an increasing sequence\nof primes numbers and pn \u2265 52(n+1) , n \u2265 0. Then there exists a simple L2 -spectrum\naction of G without the AT property.\nFollowing Connes and Woods [5] we now recall the definition of the AT property.\n\n\fAPPROXIMATELY TRANSITIVE DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND SIMPLE SPECTRUM\n\n3\n\nLet G be an Abelian countable discrete group. Assume that this group acts\nas measure preserving maps: g 7\u2192 Tg \u2208 Aut(X, B, \u03bc), where (X, B, \u03bc) is a standard probability Borel space. The action (X, B, \u03bc, T ) with T = (Tg )g\u2208G (or simply\nT ) is called AT if for an arbitrary family of nonnegative functions f1 , . . . , fl \u2208\nL1+ (X, B, \u03bc), l \u2265 2, and any \u03b5 > 0, there exist a positive integer s, elements\ng1 , . . . , gs \u2208 G, real numbers \u03bbj,k > 0, j = 1, . . . , l, k = 1, . . . , s and f \u2208 L1+ (X, B, \u03bc)\nsuch that\n(1)\n\nkfj \u2212\n\ns\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u03bbj,k f \u25e6 Tgk k1 < \u03b5, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l.\n\nRecall now that T has the funny rank one property [10], [18] if for every A \u2208\nB and \u03b5 > 0 we can find F \u2208 B, g1 , . . . , gN \u2208 G such that the family R =\n{Tg1 F, . . . , TgN F }, called a funny Rokhlin tower, consists of sets which are disjoint\nand for some J \u2282 {1, . . . , N }\n!\n[\n(2)\n\u03bc A\u25b3\nTgi F < \u03b5.\ni\u2208J\n\nAlternatively, T is of funny rank one if and only if there exists a sequence (Rn )n\u22651\nof funny towers with bases Fn such that each set A \u2208 B can be \u03b5-approximated\n(as in (2)) by the union of some levels for each Rn whenever n \u2265 n\u03b5 . From this it\neasily follows that each system which is of funny rank one is AT. Indeed, the set\nof\nconstant on levels of Rn for some n \u2265 1 (and zero outside\nS functions which are\nRn ) are dense in L1 , and the set of those which are additionally positive is dense\nin L1+ ; it follows that given f1 , . . . , fl \u2208 L1+ (X, \u03bc) and \u03b5 > 0 it is enough to take\nf = 11Fn (in (1)) for n \u2265 1 large enough.\nThe action T of G on (X, B, \u03bc) induces a (continuous) unitary representation,\ncalled a Koopman representation, of G in the space L2 (X, B, \u03bc) given by UTg f =\nf \u25e6 Tg , f \u2208 L2 (X, B, \u03bc) and g \u2208 G. We recall that a Koopman representation is said\nto have simple spectrum if for some f \u2208 L2 (X, B, \u03bc), L2 (X, B, \u03bc) = span{f \u25e6 Tg :\ng \u2208 G}. Given f \u2208 L2 (X, \u03bc) we define its spectral measure \u03c3f (or in a more precise\nb of G determined by\nnotation, \u03c3UT ,f ) to be a finite Borel measure on the dual G\nZ\nZ\nf \u25e6 Tg * f d\u03bc, for all g \u2208 G.\n\u03c7(g) d\u03c3f (\u03c7) =\n\u03c3\nbUT ,f (g) = \u03c3\nbf (g) :=\nb\nG\n\nX\n\nSee [19], [20] for more information on the spectral theory of G-actions.\n2. A criterion for a system to be non-AT\n\nLet G be an Abelian discrete countable group which we assume to act on a\nprobability standard Borel space (X, B, \u03bc) as measure-preserving maps: g 7\u2192 Tg .\nAssume that P = {P0 , P1 } a partition of X (with P0 \u2208 B). Through its P-names\nevery point x \u2208 X can be now coded: x 7\u2192 \u03c0(x) = (xg )g\u2208G where\n\u001a\n0 if Tg (x) \u2208 P0\nxg =\n1 if not.\nLet \u039b be a finite subset of G. By a funny word on the alphabet {0, 1} based on\n\u039b we mean a sequence (Wg )g\u2208\u039b with Wg \u2208 {0, 1}, g \u2208 \u039b. For any two funny words\n\n\f4\n\nE. H. EL ABDALAOUI AND M.

([9]) Let (X, B, \u03bc, T ) be an AT dynamical system. Then for any\n\u03b5 > 0 there exist a finite set \u039b \u2282 G and a funny word W based on \u039b such that\n\u0001\n|\u039b|\u03bc {x \u2208 X : d\u039b (\u03c0(x)|\u039b , W ) < \u03b5} > 1 \u2212 \u03b5.\n\nThe contraposition in Proposition 2.1 yields automatically a criterion for a system to be non-AT. Some further work has been done in [1] to formulate a condition\nstronger than the negation of the assertion in Proposition 2.1 and which may be\napplied to many systems (the criterion obtained this way is an elaborated version\nof the method already used in [9]).

Assume that a dynamical system (X, B, \u03bc, T ) is ergodic and\nthat there exists a partition P = {P0 , P1 } with the following properties:\ni) There exists S \u2208 Aut(X, B, \u03bc) commuting with all elements Tg , g \u2208 G, such\nthat SP0 = P1 .\nii) The spectral measure \u03c3 11P0 \u2212 11P1 is an SBH measure.\n\nThen the system T = (Tg )g\u2208G is not AT.\n\n3. Countable Abelian discrete group action with simple spectrum\nand without the AT property\nIn this section we shall present the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n3.1. Cocycles for discrete spectrum actions of countable discrete Abelian\ngroups. For completness, we now briefly present an extension of the classical spectral theory of compact group extensions of Z-actions to group actions.\nLet G be a countable Abelian discrete group acting on a standard probability\nBorel space (X, B, \u03bc) as measure-preserving maps: g 7\u2192 Tg \u2208 Aut(X, B, \u03bc). Assume\nthat \u0393 is a compact metric Abelian (written multiplicatively) group with Haar\nmeasure m\u0393 . A cocycle associated to T = (Tg )g\u2208G with values in \u0393 is a measurable\nfunction \u03c6 : X \u00d7 G \u2192 \u0393 which satisfies\n(3)\n\n\u03c6(x, g + g \u2032 ) = \u03c6(x, g)\u03c6(Tg x, g \u2032 )\n\n\fAPPROXIMATELY TRANSITIVE DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND SIMPLE SPECTRUM\n\n5\n\nfor a.e. x \u2208 X and all g, g \u2032 \u2208 G. We will also write \u03c6g (x) instead of \u03c6(x, g). Then\nthe \u0393-extension of T associated to \u03c6 is the G-action T\u03c6 = ((T\u03c6 )g )g\u2208G defined on\n(X \u00d7 \u0393, \u03bc \u2297 m\u0393 ) by\n2\n\n(T\u03c6 )g : X \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192 X \u00d7 \u0393, (x, \u03b3) 7\u2192 (Tg x, \u03c6g (x)\u03b3).\n\nThe space L (X \u00d7 \u0393, \u03bc \u00d7 m\u0393 ) can be decomposed as\nM\n(4)\nL2 (X \u00d7 \u0393, \u03bc \u00d7 m\u0393 ) =\nL\u03c7 ,\nb\n\u03c7\u2208\u0393\n\nN\n\nwhere each of the subspaces L\u03c7 := {f\n\u03c7 : f \u2208 L2 (X, \u03bc)} is (UT\u03c6 )g -invariant, and\nthe restriction of the Koopman representation UT\u03c6 of G to L\u03c7 is, via the map\n(5)\n\nf \u2297 \u03c7 7\u2192 f, f \u2208 L2 (X, \u03bc),\n\nunitarily equivalent to the G-representation V\u03c6,T,\u03c7 = (V\u03c6,T,\u03c7,g )g\u2208G given by\nV\u03c6,T,\u03c7,g : L2 (X, \u03bc) \u2192 L2 (X, \u03bc), V\u03c6,T,\u03c7,g (f )(x) = \u03c7(\u03c6g (x))f (Tg x), x \u2208 X.\nIt follows that the spectral properties of T\u03c6 are determined by the spectral properb\nties of V\u03c6,T,\u03c7 , \u03c7 \u2208 \u0393.\nAssume now that \u0393 = Z2 = {1, \u22121}.

In this case the decomposition (4) is given by L2 (X \u00d7 Z2 , \u03bc \u2297\nmZ2 ) = L0 \u2295 L1 where L0 = {F \u2208 L2 (X \u00d7 Z2 , \u03bc \u2297 mZ2 ) : F \u25e6 S = F } and\nL1 = {F \u2208 L2 (X \u00d7 \u0393, \u03bc \u2297 mZ2 ) : F \u25e6 S = \u2212F }. Thus the restriction of the\nKoopman representation UT\u03c6 on L1 is unitarily equivalent to the representation\nV = (Vg )g\u2208G on L2 (X, \u03bc) given by\n(Vg (f ))(x) = \u03c6g (x)f (Tg x), for all x \u2208 X, g \u2208 G.\nLet P = {P0 , P1 } be the partition of X \u00d7Z2 given by P0 = X \u00d7{1}, P1 = X \u00d7{\u22121}.\nThen 11P0 \u2212 11P1 \u2208 L1 , in fact\n\u0001\n11P0 \u2212 11P1 = 11X \u2297 11{1} \u2212 11{\u22121} = 11X \u2297 \u03c7\nwhere \u03c7 is the only non-trivial character of Z2 ; in particular k 11P0 \u2212 11P1 kL2 = 1,\nso its spectral measure is a probability measure. In view of (5) we have\nbV\u03c6,T ,\u03c7 , 11X (g) =\n\u03c3\nbUT\u03c6 , 11P0 \u2212 11P1 (g) = \u03c3\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6g (x) d\u03bc(x).\n\u03c7(\u03c6g (x)) d\u03bc(x) =\nhV\u03c6,T,\u03c7,g 11X , 11X iL2 (X,\u03bc) =\nX\n\nX\n\nMoreover, SP0 = P1 . In this way we have proved the following.\n\nLemma 3.1. For any ergodic G-action T = (Tg )g\u2208G and its Z2 -extension T\u03c6 for\nthe partition P = {P0 , P1 } defined above we have:\n(i) The element S defined above is in Aut(X \u00d7 Z2 , \u03bc \u2297 mZ2 ) and belongs to the\ncentralizer of UT\u03c6 .\n(ii) The spectral measure \u03c3 11P0 \u2212 11P1 = \u03c3UT\u03c6 , 11P0 \u2212 11P1 satisfies\nZ\n\u03c6g (x) d\u03bc(x) for all g \u2208 G.\n(6)\n\u03c3\nb 11P0 \u2212 11P1 (g) =\nX\n\n\f6\n\nE. H. EL ABDALAOUI AND M. LEMA\u0143CZYK\n\n1\n\nComparing the above lemma with Proposition 2.2 we can see that the only thing\nwhich is missing is the fact that in general the measure \u03c30 = \u03c3UT\u03c6 , 11P0 \u2212 11P1 is not\nSBH, and to achieve non-AT property we will have to control the Fourier transform\nof \u03c30 to obtain absolute continuity and a relevant boundedness of the density.\nRecall also that if in addition the spectrum of the G-action T is discrete then by\nan obvious extension of Helson's analysis from [17] we obtain that the spectral type\nof V has the purity law: it is either discrete, or continuous and purely singular, or\nequivalent to Haar measure mGb .\n3.2. Morse cocycles and Guenais' constructions. We now present Guenais'\nconstruction from [14]. Assume that (pn )n\u22650 is an increasing sequence of prime\nnumbers and let G = \u2295n\u22650 Z/pn Z. Consider the action of G on its dual X =\nQ+\u221e\nn=0 Z/pn Z by translations Tg x = x + g, where the space X is equipped with\nHaar measure \u03bc = mX (which is the product of counting measures mZ/pn Z on\ncoordinates). The resulting G-action has discrete spectrum. Moreover, the action\nT = (Tg )g\u2208G has funny rank one. Indeed, to see it set\nFn = {x \u2208 X : x0 = * * * = xn\u22121 = 0}, Gn =\n\nn\u22121\nM\nk=0\n\nZ/pn Z, n \u2265 0.\n\nThe sequence (Rn ) of funny Rokhlin towers (see (2)) is given by (Tg Fn )g\u2208Gn where\nF0 = X, G0 = {0}. Note that the union of levels of each such Rokhlin tower fills\nup the whole space.\nAs before we consider \u0393 = Z2 and by a Morse cocycle one means a cocycle which\nwill be constant on all levels of the funny Rokhlin towers (Tg Fn )g\u2208Gn , n \u2265 1, in\nthe sense made precise below.\nTake an arbitrary sequence of (\u03b5n (j))0\u2264j\u2264pn , n \u2265 0) with values in Z2 in which\n\u03b5n (0) = 1. Then define\n(7)\n\n\u03c6(x, g) = \u03c6g (x) =\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nn=0\n\n\u03b5n (xn )\u03b5n (xn + gn ) for all (x, g) \u2208 X \u00d7 G.\n\nBy (7) it follows directly that the cocycle identity (3) is satisfied and moreover for\nx \u2208 Fn and g \u2208 Gn we have\n\u03c6g (x) =\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nk=0\n\n\u03b5k (gk ) =\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\n\u03b5k (gk ),\n\nk=0\n\nso \u03c6g is constant on Fn for g \u2208 Gn (\u03c6g (x) = \u03c6g (0)) and in fact since\n\u03c6(Th x, g)\u03c6(x, g) = \u03c6(x, g + h),\nwe also have \u03c6g is constant on each level Th Fn , h \u2208 Gn , whenever g \u2208 Gn :\n\u03c6g |Th Fn = \u03c6g+h (0)\u03c6g (0). (In fact, as shown in [14], each Morse cocycle is defined\nby a Z2 -valued sequence (\u03b5n (j))0\u2264j\u2264pn , n \u2265 0).) The following has been observed\nin [14]:\n(8) For each Morse cocycle \u03c6, the representation V on L1 has simple spectrum.\nNow by the purity law it follows that once the spectral measure of 11X (for\nV ) is continuous, the spectrum on L1 is continuous and therefore the Koopman\nrepresentation UT\u03c6 has simple spectrum whenever \u03c6 is a Morse cocycle.\n\n\fAPPROXIMATELY TRANSITIVE DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND SIMPLE SPECTRUM\n\n7\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nk\nk\nfor 0 < k < pn and \u03b5n (0) = 1, where\nis the Legendre\npn\npn\nsymbol,\n\u0012\n\u0013 that is, it is equal to 1 if k 6= 0 is a square modulo pn , \u22121 if not and\n0\n= 0.\npn\nSet \u03b5n (k) =\n\n\u0012\n\nTheorem 3.2 ([14]).

The action of the group G = n=0 Z/pn Z on its dual by translations\n(as above) is a particular case of so called (C, F )-actions of the group G (see [7]),\nall such actions have the funny rank one property. It would be interesting to see\nwhether it is possible to carry out Guenais's construction of \"good\" Morse cocycles\nover a weakly mixing (C, F )-action of the group G to obtain a system which is\nnot AT; as Morse cocycles over (C, F )-actions yield systems which have simple\nspectrum on L1 we have additionally to know that the spectral types on L0 and\nL1 are mutually singular. Such a construction would be an analog of Ageev's\nconstructions [2] for Z-actions. It would be even more interesting if we could carry\nout the above over mixing (C, F )-actions of the group G constructed by Danilenko\nin [6].\nHence by (11),\n\nAcknowledgment 1.
