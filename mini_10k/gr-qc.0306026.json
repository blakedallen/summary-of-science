As far as we know, there is no easy mathematical\nor physical reason for this surprising result. The Schwarzschild metric also has Petrov type D.\nHowever, this already follows from the isometries of the metric, without using the detailed\nform of it. A rotating black hole has very few isometries and it has taken physicists a long\ntime to find its metric. Kerr found it by looking within the class of metrics of Petrov type D;\nhe was lucky to find it there.\nIn this paper we point out that something similar holds in five dimensions. The fivedimensional Schwarzschild metric has Petrov type 22 (see ref [1] for a discussion of the\nfive-dimensional Petrov classification). This is not surprising \u2013 it follows again from the\nisometries. Things are more interesting for rotating black holes. In Section 2, we prove\nthat the Myers-Perry solution [2] with one non-zero angular momentum has Petrov type 22\nas well. In Section 3, we prove a converse statement: the Myers-Perry solution is the only\nfive-dimensional metric satisfying the following conditions.\n1. The metric has 3 commuting Killing vectors and is invariant under 2 discrete Z2 transformations.\n2. The metric has Petrov type 22.\n3. The metric is asymptotically flat at infinity.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f2. The Petrov type of the Myers-Perry solution\nIn this section, we derive the Petrov type of the Myers-Perry metric [2]\nds2 = \u2212\n\n\u00012 sin2 \u03b8\nR2\n2\ndt\n\u2212\na\nsin\n\u03b8d\u03c6\n+\n\u03c12\n\u03c12\n\n\u03c12 2\ndr + \u03c12 d\u03b8 2 + r 2 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c8 2 ,\nR2\n\n\u0001\n\u00012\nr 2 + a2 d\u03c6 \u2212 adt +\n\n(2.1)\n\nwith \u03c12 = r 2 +a2 cos2 \u03b8 and R2 = r 2 \u22122M +a2 . The Petrov classification in five dimensions [1]\nis basically an invariant classification of the Weyl spinor\n\u03c8abcd = (\u03b3 ij )ab (\u03b3 kl )cd Cijkl ,\nwhere Cijkl is the Weyl tensor and \u03b3i are the five-dimensional gamma matrices1 .

This polynomial is the square of a polynomial of degree 2, hence, the\nMyers-Perry solution has Petrov type 22 in the notation of ref. [1].\n\n3. The Myers-Perry solution is unique\nWe now prove that the Myers-Perry solution is unique within a certain restricted class of\nmetrics of Petrov type 22. The outline of the proof is as follows. We make ans\u00e4tze for the\ntetrad, the connection \u03c9 and the Weyl spinor \u03a8 and solve the equations\n\u03a9 = d\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9,\n\n(3.1)\n\nd\u03a9 + [\u03c9, \u03a9] = 0.\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn these equations, the curvature \u03a9 is completely determined by the Weyl spinor \u03a8 because\nthe Ricci tensor vanishes. The condition on the Petrov type simplifies the Weyl spinor \u03a8\ndrastically. This makes it possible to find all solutions. The ans\u00e4tze can be found in section 3.1, the simplification of the Weyl spinor is discussed in section 3.2 and the solutions of\nthe field equations are given in section 3.3. It can be seen that only the Myers-Perry solution\nis flat at infinity, which proves its uniqueness. Although the Petrov condition simplifies the\nfield equations very much, the derivation of the solutions is still rather tedious. Some details\ncan be found in appendix A.\n1\n\nWe use the following convention for the gamma matrices: \u03b31 = i\u03c31 \u2297 1, \u03b32 = \u03c32 \u2297 1, \u03b33 = \u03c33 \u2297 \u03c31 , \u03b34 =\n\u03c33 \u2297 \u03c32 , \u03b3 5 = \u03c33 \u2297 \u03c33 .\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f3.1 The ans\u00e4tze\nOur coordinates are t, \u03c6, r, \u03b8, \u03c8. We assume that the metric has 3 commuting Killing vectors\nwhich we choose as \u2202t , \u2202\u03c6 and \u2202\u03c8 . In addition, we assume that the metric is invariant under\ntwo Z2 transformations:\n\u2022 (t, \u03c6) \u2192 (\u2212t, \u2212\u03c6), this reflects that the metric is invariant if the rotation reverses and\ntime flows backwards\n\u2022 \u03c8 \u2192 \u2212\u03c8 .\nThe most general ansatz for the tetrad is then as follows. The vectors et and e\u03c6 are linear\ncombinations of \u2202t and \u2202\u03c6 , the vectors er and e\u03b8 are linear combinations of \u2202r and \u2202\u03b8 and\ne\u03c8 is proportional to \u2202\u03c8 . The coefficients in these linear combinations depend only on the\nvariables r and \u03b8. The commutators then read\n[et , er ] = \u03bcet + \u03b1e\u03c6\n\n[e\u03c6 , er ] = \u03baet + \u03b6e\u03c6\n\n[et , e\u03b8 ] = \u03bdet + \u03b2e\u03c6\n\n[e\u03c6 , e\u03b8 ] = \u03bbet + \u03b7e\u03c6\n\n[er , e\u03c8 ] = \u03c3e\u03c8\n\n[er , e\u03b8 ] = \u03b4er + \u03b5e\u03b8\n\n(3.3)\n\n[e\u03b8 , e\u03c8 ] = \u03c4 e\u03c8\nIt can be shown that the most general ansatz for the Weyl spinor consistent with the above\ntetrad, is\n\u03c81111 = \u03c8\u03043333 = (T11 \u2212 T21 ) + i(T12 \u2212 T22 )\n\u03c81122 = \u03c8\u03043344 = W1 + iW2\n\u03c81133 = V1 \u2212 V2\n\u03c81144 = \u03c8\u03042233 = I2 + iI3\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u03c82222 = \u03c8\u03044444 = (T11 + T21 ) + i(T12 + T22 )\n\u03c82244 = V1 + V2\n1\n\u03c81234 = I1\n2\nThe ansatz for the tetrad breaks the local Lorentz group O(1, 4) to O(1, 1)t\u03c6 \u00d7 O(2)r\u03b8 . Under\nthis group the ansatz for the Weyl spinor transforms as\n(2, 2) \u2295 (2, 1) \u2295 (1, 2) \u2295 2 * (1, 1) \u2295 (1\u2032 , 1\u2032 )\n| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\nTij\n\nVi\n\nWi\n\nI1 ,I2\n\nI3\n\n3.2 The condition on the Petrov type\n\nThe Weyl polynomial associated with the Weyl spinor (3.4) is \u03a8 = \u03c8abcd xa xb xc xd .

This metric is not asymptotically flat.\n3.\n\u00012 k2 \u2212 k1 cos2 \u03b8\n\u0001\n\u00012\nR\u03032\n2\ndt\n\u2212\na\nsin\n\u03b8d\u03c6\n+\nr 2 + a2 d\u03c6 \u2212 adt +\n2\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n2\n2\n\u03c1\nsin \u03b8\n\u03c12 d\u03b8 2 + r 2 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c8 2 ,\ndr 2 +\n2\nk2 \u2212 k1 cos2 \u03b8\nR\u0303\n\nds2 = \u2212\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere \u03c12 = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 and R\u03032 = k1 r 2 \u2212 2M + k2 a2 . This metric has Lorentz signature\nonly if k2 \u2265 k1 \u2265 0. If k1 6= 0, the metric is actually the Myers-Perry solution (2.1). If\nk1 = 0, it is not asymptotically flat.\nHence, we see that the Myers-Perry solution is the unique metric that (i) has three commuting\nKilling vectors \u2202t , \u2202\u03c6 and \u2202\u03c8 , (ii) is invariant under (t, \u03c6) \u2192 (\u2212t, \u2212\u03c6) and \u03c8 \u2192 \u2212\u03c8, (iii) is\nasymptotically flat and (iv) has Petrov type 22.\n2\n\nI would like to thank S. Hervik for pointing this out.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f4. Conclusions\nThe well-known \"no-hair\" theorems of four-dimensional gravity do not hold in five dimensions\nfor the general stationary case. For example, in [5] a rotating ring was found with the\nsame mass and angular momentum as the Myers-Perry solution, but with a different horizon\ntopology. In the static case on the other hand, one can prove that asymptotically flat solutions\nare unique [6, 7]. See also ref. [8] for a speculation that uniqueness properties hold in higher\ndimensions if one (i) specifies the horizon topology and (ii) only considers stable solutions.\nThe uniqueness theorems can also be saved by adding supersymmetry: in ref. [9] it is proven\nthat the BMPV solution [10] is the only supersymmetric black hole of minimal N = 1,\nD = 5 supergravity. It is nice that the Myers-Perry solution is unique within the class of\nmetrics of Petrov type 22. This result could shed some light on the structure of solutions of\nfive-dimensional gravity.\nIt would be interesting to generalize the above analysis. Some possibilities are the following.\n\u2022 We have restricted our study of the Myers-Perry solution by putting one of the angular\nmomenta to zero. The above analysis can probably be generalized to the case with two\nangular momenta.\n\u2022 Preliminary investigations indicate that the rotating ring found by Reall [5] has Petrov\ntype 22. The generalization of this rotating ring to two non-zero angular momenta is\nnot known. It is possible that it can be found in the class of metrics of Petrov type 22.\n\u2022 The charged generalization of the Myers-Perry solutions is not known. The following\nreasons suggest that it might be of Petrov type 22.\n\u2013 As shown in this paper, the uncharged limit has Petrov type 22.\n\u2013 The non-rotating limit (five-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m metric) has Petrov\ntype 22 as well.\n\u2013 The charged rotating black hole in four dimensions (the Kerr-Newmann metric)\nhas the same Petrov type as the uncharged rotating black hole, i.e. Petrov type D.\nIt seems worthwhile to look for the charged generalization within the class of metrics\nof Petrov type 22.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported in part by the NSF grant PHY-0098527.

More details\nIn this appendix, we solve the Einstein equations with the ans\u00e4tze (3.3) and (3.4). As discussed in section 3.2, the Petrov condition leads to four different cases. These are discussed\nseparately.\nCase A\nWe only discuss the case where Vi is time-like. Vi light-like is a special case of Case C, which\nis discussed below. We assume V1 6= 0, otherwise, it follows from (3.2) that the space is flat.\nFrom the Bianchi equations (3.2), we obtain \u03ba = \u03b2 = 0, \u03b5 = \u2212\u03b6, \u03b4 = \u03bd and\n\u03c4 I3 = \u03b1V1\n\n\u03c3I3 = \u03bbV1\n\n\u03c4 I2 = \u2212(2\u03bd + \u03c4 )V1\n\n\u03c3I2 = (2\u03b6 + \u03c3)V1\n\nCombining the above equations with the Petrov condition (3.2) leads to\n\u03bd\u03c3 + \u03c4 \u03c3 + \u03c4 \u03b6 = 0\n\n(A.1)\n\n\u03b12 + 4\u03bd 2 + 4\u03bd\u03c4 = 0\n\n(A.2)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03bb + 4\u03b6 + 4\u03b6\u03c3 = 0\n\n(A.3)\n\nFurthermore, combining (A.1) with (3.1) gives\n\u03bb\u03b1 = 4\u03b6\u03bd\n\n(A.4)\n\nAt this point, we want to choose coordinates such that er = A\u03b6\u2202r and e\u03b8 = B\u03bd\u2202\u03b8 , where A\nand B are two functions. However, we can only make this choice if \u03b6 and \u03bd are both non-zero.\nTherefore, we have to treat the cases \u03b6 = 0 or \u03bd = 0 separately. This is a bit unfortunate\nbecause it will turn out that the solutions in the latter cases can be obtained as limits of\nsolutions in the case \u03b6 6= 0 6= \u03bd. Anyway, we break up case A into 5 subcases.\nCase A.1: \u03bd 6= 0 and \u03b6 6= 0\nFrom (3.1) and (A.4), one obtains er \u03bd = \u22123\u03b6\u03bd and e\u03b8 \u03b6 = \u22123\u03b6\u03bd. Using these equations, one\ncan show that there are coordinates such that\ner =\n\n\u03c12\n\u03b6\u2202r\nr\n\nand\n\ne\u03b8 = \u2212\n\n\u03c12\n\u03bd\u2202\u03b8 ,\na2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nwhere \u03c12 = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8. The solution of (3.1) and (3.2) is the metric (3.7).\nCase A.2: \u03bd = 0 and \u03c4 = 0\nFrom the Bianchi identities, one obtains \u03b1 = 0 and \u03bc = \u2212\u03b6. The resulting field equations are\nthen easily solved. The solution is the metric (3.6).\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fCase A.3: \u03bd = 0 and \u03c4 6= 0\nFrom the Bianchi identities, one obtains \u03bb = \u03b1 = 0, I3 = 0, I2 = \u2212V1 and \u03b6 = \u2212\u03c3. The\nsolutions in this case are the Schwarzschild metric and the Kasner metric (3.5).\nCase A.4: \u03b6 = 0 and \u03c3 = 0\nThis case leads again to the metric (3.6).\nCase A.5: \u03b6 = 0 and \u03c3 6= 0\nThis case leads again to the Schwarzschild metric or the Kasner metric.\nCase B\nWe can choose W2 = 0 and W1 = I1 by an O(2)r\u03b8 transformation. Furthermore, we can use\nan O(1, 1) boost to put \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0. The Bianchi equations yield \u03ba = 0, \u03b5 = \u2212\u03b6, \u03bc = \u03b6, \u03b4 = 0\nand \u03c4 = 0. Using the commutation relations (3.3), we can choose coordinates in which the\nmetric has the form\nds2 = A(r)d\u03c8 2 + B(r)dr 2 + r 2 ds\u03032 (t, \u03b8, \u03c6).\nFrom Einstein's equations, it directly follows that the three-dimensional metric ds\u03032 is Einstein,\nhence has constant curvature. If ds\u03032 is Euclidean, we obtain the Kasner metric (3.5). If ds\u03032\nis a sphere, we obtain the Schwarzschild metric.\nCase C\nIf I1 = 0, we can choose V1 = V2 by an O(1, 1)t\u03c6 transformation. If I1 6= 0, we make V2 = 0\nand V1 = I1 by a boost. In both cases, Einstein's equations lead to flat space.\nCase D\nWe put \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03bd = 0 by an O(1, 1)t\u03c6 \u00d7 O(2)r\u03b8 transformation. From the Bianchi identities,\none can rather easily see that there are only solutions if I3 = 0 and I2 = I1 . The Bianchi\nidentities then give \u03b7 = \u03ba = \u03bb = 0 and \u03b6 = \u03bc = \u2212\u03c3. The solution is the Kasner metric (3.5).\n\nReferences\n[1] P. J.
