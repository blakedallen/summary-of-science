The initial motivation for this paper is to discuss a more concrete\napproach to an approximation theorem of Axler and Shields, which says that the\nuniform algebra on the closed unit disc D generated by z and h - where h is\na nowhere-holomorphic harmonic function on D that is continuous up to \u2202D -\nequals C(D). The abstract tools used by Axler and Shields make harmonicity of h\nan essential condition for their result. We use the concepts of plurisubharmonicity\nand polynomial convexity to show that, in fact, the same conclusion is reached if h\nis replaced by h + R, where R is a non-harmonic perturbation whose Laplacian is\n\"small\" in a certain sense.\n\n1. Introduction and Statement of Results\nThis paper is motivated by the following result of Axler and Shields [1] (in what\nfollows, D will denote the open unit disc in C centered at the origin):\nResult 1.1 ([1], Theorem 4). Let h be a function in C(D) that is harmonic but\nnowhere holomorphic on D. Then, [z, h]D = C(D).\nRecall that [z, h]D denotes the uniform algebra on D generated by z and h. Axler\nand Shields use results that are abstract and of extremely general scope - such as\nthe Bishop Antisymmetric Decomposition - to deduce their theorems. Harmonicity\nplays a very central role in their approach, and it is difficult to answer even this\nsimple question: to what extent can we allow harmonicity to fail, by adding a small\nperturbation R to h, and yet recover the conclusion of Result 1.1 with h + R replacing\nh?\nAxler and Shields themselves imply that they tried to prove Result 1.1 without\nthe use of their deep result on the L\u221e (D)-subalgebra H \u221e (D)[h] (which is where\nharmonicity plays a key role) but to no avail (see page 636 of [1] for their statement).\nHence, there is an interest in a more explicit approach even to Result 1.1.\nWe are able, using plurisubharmonic functions and polynomial convexity in a simple\nway, to prove an Axler-Shields-type result which states that [z, h+ R]D = C(D), where\nR is a small - in an appropriate sense - non-harmonic perturbation. Furthermore,\ntaking R = 0 in our result reproduces the conclusion of Result 1.1, thus providing a\ndifferent approach to the Axler-Shields theorem.\nThe central result of this article is:\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Let h : D \u2212\u2192 C be a function that is harmonic on D and belongs to\nC(D). Let R \u2208 C 2 (D) \u2229 C(D), and suppose R is a non-harmonic perturbation of h that\nis small in the following sense:\na) The set {z \u2208 D : \u2202z (h + R)(z) = 0} has zero Lebesgue measure; and\nb) The Laplacian of R has the bound\n|\u2206R(z)| \u2264 C\n\n|\u2202z (h + R)(z)|2\n\u2200z \u2208 D,\nsupD |h + R|\n\n(1.1)\n\nfor some constant C \u2208 (0, 1).\nThen, [z, h + R]D = C(D).\nRemark 1.3. Observe that we can recover Result 1.1 from the above theorem. Firstly,\nR \u2261 0 certainly satisfies (b). Note, furthermore, that \u2202z h is anti-holomorphic on D.\nIts zeros in D thus form a discrete subset of D, hence a set of zero Lebesgue measure.\nAll the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2 are satisfied, and hence [z, h]D = C(D).\nBefore proceeding to the proof, let us glance at the central ideas involved. The\nproof may be summarised as follows (in what follows, given a function f and a set\nS \u2282 dom(f ), GrS (f ) will denote the set graph(f ) \u2229 (S \u00d7 C), i.e. the portion of the\ngraph of f whose projection onto the first coordinate is S):\n\u2022 We start with a construction that goes back to H\u00f6rmander and Wermer [5]:\nwe define the function\n\u03c8r (z, w) := |w \u2212 (h + R)(rz)|2 , (z, w) \u2208 D(0; r \u22121 ) \u00d7 C, r \u2208 (0, 1),\nwhich vanishes precisely on the graph of (h + R)(r*). We use the condition\n(1.1) to show that \u03c8r is plurisubharmonic in \u2206r := D(0; r \u22121 ) \u00d7 D(0; \u03c1), where\n\u03c1 > 0 is large enough to contain the aforementioned graph.\n\u2022 From the last fact, and the fact that each \u2206r , r \u2208 (0, 1), is Runge, we realise\nthat GrD ((h + R)(r*)) is polynomially convex. But because (h + R)(r*) \u2212\u2192\n(h + R) uniformly on D as r \u2191 1, we deduce the same for GrD (h + R).\n\u2022 Knowing that GrD (h + R) is polynomially convex, the first condition on R\nallows us to appeal to a variation on a theorem of Wermer [6, Theorem 1].\nWermer's original theorem would have required us to demand that h, R \u2208\nC 1 (D). However, with very slight modifications to Wermer's proof, we can\nappeal to the resulting theorem to infer that [z, h + R]D = C(D).\nThe main idea needed for the aforementioned variation on Wermer's theorem has\nbeen remarked upon in [6]. However, it might be of interest to the reader to see\nthe relevant lemmas carefully restated to suit the present setting (i.e. with lower\nboundary regularity). Hence, we shall discuss this variation in Section 2. The proof\nof Theorem 1.2 will be presented in Section 3.\nAdded in proof: It was brought to our notice that stronger results subsuming\nResult 1.1 had been established by Chirka [3] in 1969. However, there are gaps in the\nproofs of [3, Theorem 4] and [3, Theorem 5], on which Chirka's results rely. The most\nsignificant gap is the one in the proof of Theorem 4, which is false as stated. The proof\nb A is always connected\nappears to presume that (in the notation of [3, Theorem 4]) K\n(assuming w.l.o.g. that K is connected). In short: [1] has the earliest complete proof\nof Result 1.1 that we are aware of. That said, we feel that the basic ideas in [3] could\n\n\fUNIFORM ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nstill (bypassing [3, Theorem 4] and [3, Theorem 5] entirely) be made to work; thus\nrecovering Chirka's results in C2 (which are slightly stronger than ours).\n2. Technical Results\nWe begin this section with a technical, but essentially elementary, result. We must\nfirst explain some notation. Given a domain \u03a9 \u2282 Cd and a real-valued function\nF \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9), the Levi form of F at z - denoted by LF (z; *) - is the quadratic form\ngiven by\nLF (z; V ) :=\n\nd\nX\n\nj,k=1\n\n\u22022F\n(z)vj v k\n\u2202zj \u2202z k\n\n\u2200V = (v1 , . . . , vd ) \u2208 Cd .\n\nLemma 2.1. Let \u03a9 be a domain in C and let f \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9). Define the function\n\u03c8(z, w) := |w \u2212 f (z)|2 , (z, w) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 C. Then, for the Levi form L\u03c8(z, w; V ), V =\n(V1 , V2 ) \u2208 C2 , we have\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n(2.1)\nL\u03c8(z, w; V ) \u2265 2Re (f (z) \u2212 w)\u2202zz\nf (z) + |\u2202z f (z)|2 |V1 |2 .\nIn particular, if f = h + R, where h \u2208 harm(\u03a9), we have\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n2\nL\u03c8(z, w; V ) \u2265 |\u2202z (h + R)(z)|2 + 2Re (h(z) + R(z) \u2212 w)\u2202zz\nR(z) |V1 |2 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nProof. We compute:\n2\n2\n\u03c8(z, w) = 2Re(\u2202zz\nf (z).(f (z) \u2212 w)) + |\u2202z f (z)|2 + |\u2202z f (z)|2 ,\n\u2202zz\n2\n\u03c8(z, w) = \u2212\u2202z f (z),\n\u2202zw\n2\n\u03c8(z, w) = 1.\n\u2202ww\n\nNow, using the above calculation, we have the Levi form L\u03c8(z, w; V ), with V =\n(V1 , V2 ) \u2208 C2 , as (we denote the function mapping (z, w) 7\u2212\u2192 w by w):\n\u0001\n2\nL\u03c8(*; V ) = 2Re(\u2202zz\nf * (f \u2212 w)) + |\u2202z f |2 + |\u2202z f |2 |V1 |2 \u2212 2Re(\u2202z f * V1 V2 ) + |V2 |2\n\u0001\n2\nf * (f \u2212 w)) + |\u2202z f |2 |V1 |2\n= |\u2202z f * V1 \u2212 V2 |2 + 2Re(\u2202zz\n\u0001\n2\nf * (f \u2212 w)) + |\u2202z f |2 |V1 |2 .\n\u2265 2Re(\u2202zz\n2 h = 0.\nThe second inequality follows by replacing f by h + R and noting that \u2202zz\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now present the following variation on [6, Theorem 1]. We need to clarify some\nnotation needed in its proof: given a compact subset K \u22d0 Cd , we define\nP(K) := the class of uniform limits on K of holomorphic polynomials in Cd .\nTheorem 2.2 (A variation on Theorem 1 of [6]). Let f : D \u2212\u2192 C be a continuous\nfunction. Assume GrD (f ) is polynomially convex. Define\nS := {z \u2208 D : there exists a C-open neighbourhood Vz \u220b z such that\nf has continuous first-order partial derivatives on Vz },\nand let W := {z \u2208 S : \u2202z f (z) 6= 0}. If D \\ W has zero Lebesgue measure, then\n[z, f ]D = C(D).\n\n\f4\n\nGAUTAM BHARALI AND SUSHIL GORAI\n\nRemark 2.3. Wermer's original result requires that f \u2208 C 1 (D) and that \u2202z f be nonvanishing. But immediately after the proof of [6, Theorem 1], it is stated that the\nhypothesis of [6, Theorem 1] can be weakened by letting the condition \u2202z f (z) 6= 0 fail\non a non-empty subset of zero Lebesgue measure. The key to Theorem 2.2 is that f\ncan also be allowed to be non-differentiable on this exceptional set. We justify this\nbelow.\nSketch of the proof of Theorem 2.2. Since the proof involves minor modifications to\nthe original, we shall be brief. The notation \u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D will denote a complex measure\n\u03bc \u2208 C(D)\u22c6 representing a bounded linear functional on C(D) that annihilates [z, f ]D .\nWermer's proof uses the following fact, which occurs as a part of Bishop's proof of\n[2, Theorem 4]:\n(\u2217) (Bishop) For any complex measure \u03bc \u2208 C(D)\u22c6 , let\nZ\n1\nH\u03bc (a) :=\nd\u03bc(z).\nz\n\u2212\na\nC\nIf H\u03bc = 0 m-a.e., then \u03bc = 0 (m denotes the planar Lebesgue measure on C).\nWermer's strategy consists of the following two parts:\n(a) Use the Oka-Weil theorem to construct, for each a \u2208 D, an open neighbourhood D \u2283 GrD (f ) and a function h \u2208 O(D) (which depend on a) such that:\n\u2022 \u2203R > 0 such that h(GrD (f )) \u2282 ER \u222a {0}, where ER denotes the complement in C of the closed sector {rei\u03b8 : 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R, |\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c0/4}.\n\u2022 h is non-vanishing on GrD (f ) \\ {(a, f (a))}.\n\u2022 \u2203h1 \u2208 O(D) satisfying h(z, w) = (z \u2212 a)h1 (z, w) \u2200(z, w) \u2208 D.\n(b) Apply (for a fixed a \u2208 D) the dominated convergence theorem to the measure\n\u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D and the sequence\n{h1 (* , f )Pn \u25e6 h(* , f )}n\u2208Z+ \u2282 P(D)\n(where the sequence {Pn }n\u2208Z+ is as given by [6, Lemma 3]) to conclude that\nH\u03bc (a) = 0. This implies H\u03bc \u2261 0 because the above argument works for each\na \u2208 D.\nSince H\u03bc \u2261 0 for every \u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D , it follows from (\u2217) that [z, f ]D = C(D).\nObserve that the inference H\u03bc \u2261 0 (for \u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D ) is stronger than is necessary\nfor the desired conclusion. This suggests the following modified two-step strategy:\n(a\u2032 ) Construct the objects (D, h, ER , h1 ) having exactly the same properties as in\nPart (a) above, but only associated to each a \u2208 W .\n\u2032\n(b ) Repeat Part (b) of Wermer's strategy for all those points a \u2208 D for which\nWermer's dominated-convergence-theorem argument, showing H\u03bc (a) = 0, still\nmakes sense (call the complement of all such points E).\ne \u2229 D), where:\nIt is not hard to see that E = (D \\ W ) \u222a (E\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n\u22121\ne\n|z \u2212 a| d|\u03bc|(z) = \u221e .\nE := a \u2208 C :\nC\n\ne has zero Lebesgue measure, which is a well-known fact about finite, positive\nThe set E\nBorel measures in general. By exactly the same considerations as in Part (b) - and\n\n\fUNIFORM ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\n/ D - our modified strategy\nfrom the obvious fact that \u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D =\u21d2 H\u03bc (a) = 0 \u2200a \u2208\ngives us\n\u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D =\u21d2 H\u03bc (a) = 0 \u2200a \u2208 C \\ E.\nSince, by hypothesis, m(E) = 0, we infer from (\u2217) that each \u03bc \u22a5 [z, f ]D is just the\n\u2737\nzero measure. Hence, [z, f ]D = C(D).\n3. The proof of Theorem 1.2\nWe recall a standard notation that we shall use in our proof. Given a domain\n\u03a9 \u2282 Cd and a compact subset K \u22d0 \u03a9, we define the O(\u03a9)-hull of K as\nb \u03a9 := {z \u2208 \u03a9 : |f (z)| \u2264 supK |f | \u2200f \u2208 O(\u03a9)}.\nK\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2. We begin with a preliminary observation. The estimate (1.1)\nmay be rewritten as\n|\u2206R(z)| \u2264\n\n|\u2202z (h + R)(z)|2\n\u0001\n,\nsupD |h + R| + C1 \u2212 1 supD |h + R|\n\nwhence we can certainly find a constant \u03b40 > 0 such that\n\u0001\nsup |h + R| + C1 \u2212 1 sup |h + R| \u2265 sup |h + R| + \u03b40 .\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nHence, for the remainder of this proof, we may assume that\n|\u2206R(z)| \u2264\n\n|\u2202z (h + R)(z)|2\n\u2200z \u2208 D.\nsupD |h + R| + \u03b40\n\n(3.1)\n\nFor each r \u2208 (0, 1), let us define\n\u03c8r (z, w) := |w \u2212 (h + R)(rz)|2 , (z, w) \u2208 D(0; r \u22121 ) \u00d7 C.\nThe Levi-form computations (2.1) and (2.2), taken together with the the estimate\n(3.1) on \u2206R, establish that\n\u03c8r is plurisubharmonic in \u2206r := D(0; r \u22121 ) \u00d7 D(0; M + 2\u03b40 ) \u2200r \u2208 (0, 1),\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere M := supD |h + R|. Given these preliminaries, we can complete the proof in\ntwo steps.\nStep I: Polynomial convexity of GrD (h + R).\nSince (h + R) is uniformly continuous on D, it follows that:\nFor each \u03b5 > 0, \u2203\u03b4(\u03b5) > 0 such that\n0 < (1 \u2212 r) \u2264 \u03b4(\u03b5) =\u21d2 |(h + R)(rz) \u2212 (h + R)(z)| < \u03b5 \u2200z \u2208 D.\n\n(3.3)\n\nConsider a point p = (z0 , w0 ) \u2208 D \u00d7 D(0; M + 2\u03b40 ) \\ GrD (h + R). Then, by definition,\n\u03c81 (z0 , w0 ) =: \u03b52p > 0. Write r(p) := 1 \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b5p /3), where \u03b4(\u03b5p /3) is as given by (3.3).\nThen, (3.3) tells us:\n|w0 \u2212 (h + R)(r(p)z0 )| \u2265 |w0 \u2212 (h + R)(z0 )| \u2212 |(h + R)(z0 ) \u2212 (h + R)(r(p)z0 )|\n> 2\u03b5p /3,\n\u03c8r(p) (z, w) = |(h + R)(z) \u2212 (h + R)(r(p)z)|2 < \u03b52p /9 \u2200(z, w) \u2208 GrD (h + R).\n\n\f6\n\nGAUTAM BHARALI AND SUSHIL GORAI\n\nBy the last two estimates, we have just shown that\n\u03c8r(p) (p) > 4\u03b52p /9 and \u03c8r(p) (z, w) < \u03b52p /9 \u2200(z, w) \u2208 GrD (h + R).\n\n(3.4)\n\nb To do so, we invoke a well/ K.\nLet us now write K := GrD (h + R). We claim that p \u2208\nknown result of H\u00f6rmander [4, Theorem 4.3.4] which states that if \u03a9 \u2282 Cd , d \u2265 2, is\nb \u03a9 can also\na pseudoconvex domain and K \u22d0 \u03a9 is a compact subset, then the hull K\nbe expressed as:\nb \u03a9 = {z \u2208 Cd : U (z) \u2264 supK U \u2200U \u2208 psh(\u03a9)}.\nK\nb \u2206 . Note that each \u2206r(p) is Runge. We know\nIt thus follows from (3.4) that p \u2208\n/K\nr(p)\nb\u2206\nb Since p was arbitrarily chosen, we have just shown that\ntherefore that K\n=\nK.\nr(p)\nb \u2200p \u2208 D \u00d7 D(0; M + 2\u03b40 ) \\ K.\np\u2208\n/K\n\nb\nOf course, it is easy to see that no point in C2 \\ (D \u00d7 D(0; M )) can belong to K.\nHence, K = GrD (h + R) is polynomially convex.\nStep II: Completing the proof.\nWe appeal to Theorem 2.2 with (h + R) playing the role of f . In the terminology of\nTheorem 2.2\nD \\ W = \u2202D \u222a {z \u2208 D : \u2202z (h + R)(z) = 0},\nwhich, by hypothesis, has zero Lebesgue measure. We have already established that\nGrD (h + R) is polynomially convex. Thus, (h + R) satisfies all the conditions stated\n\u0003\nin Theorem 2.2, and we conclude that [z, h + R]D = C(D).\nAcknowledgements.
