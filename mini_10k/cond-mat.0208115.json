The theoretical calculations\nassumed the superconductivity to be mediated by an\nabundance of low-energy small-wavevector magnetic excitations. These excitations become prevalent near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), that is at the\nvalue of the pressure (or another control parameter) at\nwhich a second order transition is driven to zero temperature and at which the longitudinal magnetic susceptibility becomes singular. More recent theoretical work\nsuggests that in an isotropic material a coupling between transverse and longitudinal excitations, which is\npresent only in the ferromagnetic phase, should give a\nmuch higher superconducting transition in the ferromagnetic state [6]. The presence of crystalline anisotropy has\nalso been considered, and was shown to circumvent the\ndepression of the superconducting critical temperature\nexactly at the QCP itself [7].\nFor UGe2 it has already been established that in the\nlimit of zero temperature the transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism as the pressure is increased\nthrough pc \u2248 15.8 kbar is first order [8]. This transition\ntherefore does not correspond to a QCP. However, at\nlower pressures the temperature dependence of the magnetisation shows a sharp change at a pressure dependent\ntemperature Tx (p) well below the Curie temperature. Tx\ndecreases with p and vanishes at px \u2248 12.2 kbar. The\nsuperconducting transition temperature, Ts , and superconducting coupling parameter are largest at pressures\nclose to px [9]. This would be naturally explained in the\nspirit of the above theory if Tx were to correspond to a\nsecond order transition, with px a QCP for this transition. A detailed explanation along these lines has indeed\nbeen proposed [10] in which Tx is identified with the for-\n\nmation of a simultaneous charge and spin density wave\n(CSDW). Theoretically the formation of a CSDW would\nlead to a change in the temperature evolution of the magnetic moment, as well as an enhancement of the longitudinal magnetic susceptibility [10] similar to that near to\na simple ferromagnetic QCP. Although band structure\ncalculations [11,12] indicate that a spin-majority Fermisurface sheet could become nested as a function of the\nmagnetic polarisation, a necessary condition for a CSDW\nto arise, extensive neutron diffraction studies [13] have as\nyet failed to detect any static order due to a CSDW.\nIn this Letter we establish for the first time that the\nlow T ordered moment (i.e. the ferromagnetic order parameter) and therefore a first order derivative of the free\nenergy changes abruptly at px . Thus there is unambiguously a first-order transition between two ferromagnetic\nphases at px and therefore no QCP. We will refer to the\nhigh pressure phase as FM1 and the low pressure phase\nas FM2.\nAlthough the low-field low-temperature uniform longitudinal susceptibility undergoes a large change between\nFM1 and FM2, we show that it is almost pressure independent within each phase and is thus not correlated with\nTs (p) far away from px . Above px the transition FM1\u2192\nFM2 can be induced by a magnetic field. We find that\nthe field at which the transition occurs, Hx , depends on\np but the magnetic polarisation at Hx is only weakly p\ndependent. This shows that the FM1\u2192FM2 transition\noccurs at a particular spin splitting between the majority\nand minority spin bands as would occur when the Fermi\nenergy passes through a sharp maximum in the electronic\ndensity of states for one spin direction. If virtual excitations to states at this maximum were also associated with\nthe superconducting pairing mechanism a pairing spectrum peaked at finite energy (in the extreme limit an\nEinstein spectrum) would result. We show that this provides a natural relationship between Ts in zero field and\n1\n\n\f60\n\np (kbar)\n0\n4.0\n8.0\n10.0\n11.4\n12.8\n15.0\n\n1\n\n(a)\n40\n\nT\n\nT (K)\n\n\u03bc (\u03bcB/f.u.)\n\n1.5\n\nC\n\nFM1\n20\n\nT\nFM2\n\n0.5\n\nx\n\nT * 10\ns\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nT (K)\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nB\n\n0\n\nM (\u03bc /f.u.)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1.

Thus the pressure dependence of Ts , which was the motivation for previously\nsupposing that there was a QCP at px , can be explained\nwithout invoking a QCP.\nTwo different single crystals cut by spark erosion from\nlarger crystals grown by the Czochralski technique were\nstudied. The larger was a cylinder of diameter 2.4 mm\nand length 5 mm parallel to the easy magnetic a-axis,\nwhile the smaller was a plate also parallel to this axis\n(glued to a small washer to fix its orientation in the pressure cell). Other parts of the larger crystal had previously been studied and found to have residual resistivity ratios of order 100 (current parallel to the b axis)\n[3,14]. The larger sample was also confirmed to become\nsuperconducting under pressure in a separate a.c. susceptibility measurement [15]. Here we do not distinguish\nfurther between the two samples since they gave equivalent results, with only small differences in the widths\nof the various transitions. The d.c. magnetization was\nmeasured with a non-magnetic Cu:Be clamp cell using\na methanol:ethanol (1:4) pressure transmitting medium\nin a commercial vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).\nThe pressure was determined from the superconducting\ntransition of Sn. The empty pressure cell generated a\nvery weakly T and H dependent background contribution that was smaller than two percent of the signal from\nthe larger sample in the ferromagnetic state at low temperature. The data shown have been corrected for this\nbackground. The samples were seen to float freely within\nthe pressure medium before and after the experiment,\nwhile their orientation was constrained by the bore of\nthe teflon sealing capsule in the cell (internal diameter\n2.5 mm, external diameter 3.0 mm).

(a) The p versus T phase diagram of UGe2 . TC\nis the Curie temperature and Tx is defined in the text. Ts is\nthe superconducting temperature (onset) from ref. 14. The\nlines through the data points are a guide to the eye, noting\nthat Ts might change discontinuously at px and pc . (b) The\npressure dependence of \u03bc in zero field at 2.3 K, (full circles).\nThe moment obtained by extrapolating the data from above\nHx to zero field (squares) is also shown when this is different.\n(c) the pressure evolution of the fields Hx and Hm of metamagnetic transitions (at which dM/dH has a local maximum)\nat 2.3 K.\n\ndetermining the magnetisation is only about 5 percent.\nWe have therefore scaled the data for each sample by a\nconstant factor close to unity to give the correct ordered\nmoment of 1.5 \u03bcB /formula at zero pressure. The experimental error in measuring the relative changes of magnetisation is in contrast much smaller, and smaller than\nthe size of the data points used in the various figures.\nIn Fig. 1 the temperature dependence of the ordered\nmagnetic moment, \u03bc(T ), in zero field at different pressures is shown (we use the symbol \u03bc for the ordered moment extrapolated to zero field and M more generally\nfor the magnetisation in a field). A clear change in the T\ndependence of \u03bc(T ) occurs at Tx , as has been previously\nreported [14,16], where Tx decreases with increasing p\nand disappears as p \u2192 px \u2248 12.2 kbar. While TC can\nbe conveniently defined as the point where \u2212dM/dT is\na maximum in a small field (we used 0.02 T) the determination of Tx is slightly more subjective and is taken\n\n2\n\n\f1.6\n\n1.2\n\n18.2 kbar\n0.08\nac\n\n0.8\n\n15.7 kbar\n3K\n\n\u03c7\n\nM (\u03bcB/f.u.)\n\nis in itself an indication that the transition between the\ntwo magnetic phases is first order. We now consider further the transitions at Hx . Hysteresis loops of the d.c.\nmagnetisation in low fields show that the sample is already mono-domain in a field of 0.02 Tesla and therefore\nno hysteresis would normally be expected at much higher\nfields of several Tesla. However we observe hysteresis of\na few mT (not visible on the scale of Fig. 3) at both\nHm and Hx in careful measurements. The evidence for\nsuch hysteresis at Hx and Hm is demonstrated unambiguously by comparing the present data to measurements of\nthe a.c. susceptibility, \u03c7ac . In the inset of Fig. 3, \u03c7ac\nis shown as a function of field in the vicinity of Hx at\na pressure of 15.7 kbar (from reference [14]). The amplitude of the peak in the a.c. susceptibility at 3 K is\nsmaller than the derivative of the uniform magnetisation\ndM/dH at Hx , despite the fact that the peak in the a.c.\nmeasurement is slightly sharper than the d.c. transition\nwidth. Further, dM/dH at Hx , decreases with increasing\nT , whereas the amplitude of the peak in \u03c7a.c. increases\nwith T (at least up to 5 K). This shows that the a.c. measurement traces minor hysteresis loops in the vicinity of\nHx that become wider at lower T . The same result is\nalso found for the transition at Hm [8]. The observation of hysteresis supports our previous conclusion that\nthe transition between the FM1 and FM2 phases is first\norder at low temperature; for a first order transition a\nphase can exist metastably in a limited region beyond\nthat in which it is thermodynamically stable.\nWe now discuss the maximum of Ts (p) near px , which\nwas previously the main motivation to suppose that\npx marked a QCP. We focus on the FM1 phase (i.e.\npx < p < pc ) where the superconducting transitions are\nmuch sharper. For ferromagnetically mediated pairing\nTs can be estimated as Ts = \u03b8 e\u2212\u03b3/g\u2206\u03b3 , where \u2206\u03b3 is that\npart of the linear temperature dependence of the normal\nstate electronic heat capacity, \u03b3, associated with the excitations responsible for pairing [19,20]. \u03b8 is the characteristic energy of these excitations and g the effectiveness\nof this pairing channel (we consider the superconductivity to be non s-wave with g < 1 and constant). In the\nusual description of itinerant ferromagnetism the spectrum of longitudinal magnetic excitations is assumed to\nbe a Lorentzian peaked at zero energy (\u03c9) and wavevector transfer (q) [20]. For such a spectrum and conventional q- and \u03c9-independent mode-mode coupling \u2206\u03b3 is\ndirectly related to the T dependence of \u03bc2 at low T . Our\nexperiment shows that the temperature dependence is\nmuch weaker for pressures just above px than just below pc (Fig. 1). \u2206\u03b3 is therefore expected to increase\nsignificantly with p even though the static longitudinal\nsusceptibility defined as dM/dH (Fig. 3) is experimentally almost independent of p between px and pc . The\nlatter point could still be reconciled with a Lorentzian\nspectrum if the width of the spectrum increases either in\nq or \u03c9. However, experimentally \u03b3 is known to be almost\n\np=0\n\n0.4\nT \u2248 2.3 K\n\n0\n4\n\n1K\n\nH (T)\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\nH (T)\nFIG. 3. The field dependence of the easy-axis magnetization at 2.3 K for various pressures. The broken line passes\nthrough the points Hx at which dM/dH has a local maximum. The magnetisation at Hx is almost independent of\npressure and suggests that the transition FM1\u2192FM2 occurs at a fixed value for the splitting between spin majority\nand minority bands. Curves correspond from top to bottom\nto p = 0, 6.5, 9.0, 11.1, 12.8, 13.8, 15.3, 15.5, 16.0, 16.7, 17.3 and\n18.2 kbar. The inset shows the a.c. susceptibility in S.I. units\nmeasured as a function of field at 15.7 kbar at 1 K and 3 K.\n\nas the position of a local maximum of d\u03bc/dT . The resulting p versus T phase diagram for UGe2 constructed\nfrom the present measurements is shown in Fig. 2(a)\nalong with Ts (p) taken from reference [14]. Tx cannot be\nassigned from the present magnetisation measurements\nbelow \u223c 6 kbar. The position of a peak in the temperature derivative of the resistivity reported by Oomi et al.\n[17] can however be used to extend the Tx line to give\nTx \u2248 30 K at p = 0. In the following we focus on the\npressure dependence of the magnetisation at low T .\nThe p dependence of the low T ordered moment \u03bc at\n2.3 K is shown in Fig. 2(b). Striking features are the\nabrupt changes of \u03bc(p) on crossing px and pc , respectively. This is the main new result. It shows that the\ntransition from FM2 \u2192 FM1 at px is a first-order transition in the limit of T = 0, and confirms that the transition from the ferromagnetic state FM1 to the paramagnetic phase at pc is also first order [8,14,18].\nThe field dependence of the magnetisation at 2.3 K for\ndifferent p is shown in Fig. 3. For pressure p > px a\nlarge increase of nearly 50 % in the magnetisation is observed at a field Hx , (Hx , defined as the field at which\ndM/dH has a local maximum is plotted as a function\nof pressure in Fig. 2(c)). For p > pc the magnetisation\nundergoes a second increase at a lower field Hm corresponding to the transition from the paramagnetic phase\nto FM1. Interestingly, the uniform susceptibility given\nby the slope dM/dH has almost constant values independent of the pressure within each phase; in the FM1 phase\nit is greater than in the FM2 phase but less than in the\nparamagnetic state above pc\nThe existence of metamagnetic behavior just above px\n\n3\n\n\fconstant between px and pc [21] and thus Ts (p) would\nalso increase with p if superconductivity was indeed due\nto a Lorentzian spectrum of excitations. This is in stark\ncontrast with the observed decrease of Ts with p. Thus\na simple spectrum of longitudinal magnetic excitations\nof the type usually considered near a ferromagnetic QCP\ncannot account for our experimental observations.\nIn the following we outline a mechanism that qualitatively explains the observed pressure dependence of Ts\nconsistently with first order transitions at px and Hx .\nThe mechanism is based on our observation that the\nFM1\u2192FM2 transition occurs at a constant magnetisation independent of the pressure. This strongly suggests\nthat the transition takes place when the Fermi-energy\ncrosses a sharp maximum in the electronic density of\nstates (DOS) for one spin-polarisation. In the FM1 phase\nan applied field parallel to the easy magnetic axis leads\nto an additional Zeeman splitting between the majority\nand minority spin bands, which drives the Fermi-energy\nthrough this maximum. \u03bcB Hx is then proportional to\nthe energy of the maximum in the DOS relative to the\nFermi-energy in zero field. If we suppose that the superconducting pairing involves virtual excitations that\naccess the same feature in the DOS the pairing strength\nand therefore \u2206\u03b3 decrease strongly as the feature becomes more remote from the Fermi-surface. Thus, for\nexample, the decrease of Ts with p in the FM1 phase is a\nnaturally linked with the increase in Hx . Further support\nthat the excitations responsible for pairing have a spectrum peaked at a finite energy proportional to Hx comes\nfrom the measured upper critical field for fields along the\nc-axis (i.e. perpendicular to the easy axis). It has previously been shown that the temperature dependence of\nthe upper critical field is well modelled by a strong coupling calculation assuming an Einstein spectrum for the\npairing interaction [9]; the position of the peak in the\nspectrum obtained by fitting the measured upper critical\nfield to this model increases with pressure in the FM1\nphase as we have described.\nSpectroscopic measurements capable of detecting a\nsharp peak in the DOS have not yet been reported.\nQuantum oscillation measurements as a function of p\nwere however recently published [18] and so we briefly\nexamine whether these can be reconciled with a sharp\npeak in the D.O.S. The striking feature in the quantum\noscillation data is that the electronic masses of all the\ndetected orbits are much higher in the FM1 phase than\nin the FM2 phase (some frequencies remain similar while\nothers differ substantially). Large mass renormalisations\nin heavy fermion materials are usually attributed to a\nKondo-like mechanism where narrow f-electron bands in\nthe pure ordered system play the roles of the Kondo impurity states lying just below the Fermi energy in the\noriginal Kondo analysis [22]. Assuming a similar mechanism is responsible for the large effective masses observed\nin the FM1 phase of UGe2 the much smaller masses in\n\nthe FM2 phase require a destruction of the mechanism.\nSuch a destruction would indeed occur if the Fermi level\nwere to cross one of the narrow bands responsible for the\nresonant mass enhancement.\nTo conclude, we note that understanding the emergence of new physical behaviours close to quantum criticality represents one of the central themes in contemporary studies of correlated electron physics. The case of\na ferromagnetic QCP is particularly important since the\norder parameter is directly measurable by macroscopic\ntechniques. However we have shown that although superconductivity in UGe2 is intimately related to a proximity\nto a magnetic phase transition there is no quantum criticality associated with the suppression of this transition to\nzero temperature at pressure px . The implication is that\nnew ground states (in this case non-conventional superconductivity) can emerge in strongly correlated electron\nsystems due to a much wider range of circumstances than\nhas hitherto been supposed.\nDiscussions with J.
