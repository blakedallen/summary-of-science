In a model independent way we\nexplore such specific form of the charged lepton mass matrix having a\nspecial structure in 1-2 block. The contribution to the solar mass splitting\narising out of radiative corrections in MSSM, is calculated, thus making\nthe model stable under radiative corrections.\n\nIntroduction: The data on solar neutrino oscillation has been traditionally shown on the (sin2 2\u03b812 , \u2206m221 ) plane but a new parametrization on the\n(tan2 \u03b812 , \u2206m221 ) plane with the usual sign convention \u2206m221 = m22 \u2212 m21 > 0 has\nbeen recently suggested[1] to explain the solar data. In this new parametrization the most recent result from the SNO-Superkamiokande[2] favours the \"\nlight side\", tan2 \u03b812 < 1, and disfavours the \"dark side\", tan2 \u03b812 > 1. It\nhas also imposed certain restrictions on the validity of the proposed neutrino\nmass models which are otherwise allowed in the old parametrization. This\ncan be understood from the definition of leptonic mixing matrix VMN S where\ntan2 \u03b812 = |Ve2 |2 /|Ve1 |2 < 1 implies |Ve2 | < |Ve1 | for the usual sign convention\n\u2206m221 = m22 \u2212 m21 > 0, whereas such restriction does not exist in the definition\nof sin2 2\u03b812 = 4|Ve1 |2 |Ve2 |2 .\nFor our analysis in the present work, we take here the most general form of\ntexture of the inverted neutrino masses, which is assumed to be valid at high\nscale\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03b4 1 1\nmLL = \uf8ed 1 \u01eb1 \u01eb2 \uf8f8 m0 ,\n(1)\n1 \u01eb2 \u01eb1\nHere we consider two possibilities. In case(i) we take \u03b4 = \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 0, leading\nto \u2206m221 = 0. This represents the case of perfect Le \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 symmetry. In\n1\n\n\fcase(ii) we have \u03b4 \u223c \u01eb1 \u223c \u01eb2 \u223c \u03bb3 , leading to \u2206m221 > 0. The quantum radiative\ncorrections may modify the above two cases and their low-energy values are case(i): \u2206m2sol = \u03b4rad when an appropriate charged lepton mass matrix is\ntaken into consideration [3]; and case(ii): \u2206m2sol = \u2206m221 + \u03b4rad . In MSSM\nthe radiative correction term \u03b4rad is a negative quantity[4] and therefore, it will\nlead to tan2 \u03b812 > 1 in case (i). But in case (ii) if \u2206m221 > \u03b4rad , the radiative\nstability will still be maintained with tan2 \u03b821 < 1. This point will be further\nexamined in present work.\nFormalism and Results: Expressing mLL in the basis where the charged\nT\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032T\nlepton mass matrix is diagonal, we have m\u2032LL = VeL mLL VeL\n, m\u2032diag\nLL = V\u03bdL mLL V\u03bdL ,\n\u2032\u2020\nwhere VMN S = V\u03bdL , and VeL is the diagonalizing matrix for charged lepton mass\nmatrix. The neutrino flavour eigenstate \u03bdf is related to the mass eigenstate \u03bdi\nby the relation \u03bdf = Vf i \u03bdi and the MNS mixing matrix is given by Vf i where\nf = \u03c4, \u03bc, e and i = 1, 2, 3. We take the usual convention of the neutrino mass\neigenvalues |m\u03bd1 | < |m\u03bd2 |, and this fixes the ordering of the first two columns\nof the leptonic mixing matrix VMN S . We present here only one simple case of\nthe left-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix having \u03b4 = 0, \u01eb2 = 0, \u01eb1 = \u03bb3\nfor our demonstration in the present analysis, mLL with m0 = 0.05eV in\nEq.(1); and the neutrino mass eigenvalues mi = (\u22121.4089, 1.4195, 0.01065)m0,\ni = 1, 2, 3, leading to the neutrino mass splittings \u2206m221 = 7.4952 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV 2\nand \u2206m223 = 5.0335 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV 2 . For our choice of the diagonal charged lepton\nmass matrix, the MNS mixing matrix is expressed as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 1\n\u221a +\u03b1\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u03b1\n0\n2\n2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nVMN S = \uf8ed 12 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212( 21 + \u03b2) \u2212 \u221a12 \uf8f8\n1\n\u221a1\n\u2212( 21 + \u03b2)\n2 \u2212\u03b2\n2\nwhere \u03b1 = 0.001335 and \u03b2 = 0.00094. Here tan2 \u03b812 =\n\n| \u221a1 \u2212\u03b1|2\n2\n\n| \u221a1 +\u03b1|2\n\n< 1 for the\n\n2\n\n\u2206m221\n\nusual convention\n> 0. In case of exact Le \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 symmetry as in case\n(i) where \u03b4 = \u01eb1,2 = 0 and \u2206m221 = 0, and the above VMN S takes the form with\n\u2020\n\u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 = 0. In the above example the VMN S (= V\u03bdL\n) obtained from the\nmLL alone fails to explain the LMA MSW solution as it predicts the maximal\nsolar mixings, and any small deviation in the texture of mLL will hardly affect\nthe maximal value of tan2 \u03b812 . The last hope is that there could be a significant\nnegative contribution to \u03b812 from VeL obtained from the diagonalisation of the\ncharged lepton mass matrix ml having special structure in 1-2 block. We wish\n\u03bd\ne\nto examine here how \u03b812 = (\u03b812\n\u2212 \u03b812\n) can resolve the LMA MSW solar neutrino\nmixing scenario.\nIn a model independent way we parametrize the charged lepton mixing VeL\nas\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nc\u030412 s\u030412 0\nVeL = \uf8ed \u2212s\u030412 c\u030412 0 \uf8f8\n(2)\n0\n0 1\n\nThis gives a special form in the 1-2 block. We can reconstruct the symmetric\n\u2020\ncharged lepton mass matrix using Eq.(2) from the relation, ml = VeL\nmdiag\nVeR ,\nl\n2\n\n\fwhere we consider VeL = VeR for symmetric matrix.

The values of |Ve3 | are\nalso in accord with the CHOOZ experiment.\nFinally we check the stability of the neutrino mass matrix under RGEs.\nFollowing the standard procedure[4,5] we express mLL in terms of K, the coefficient of the dimension five neutrino mass operator in a scale-dependent manner\nmLL (t) = vu2 (t)K(t) where t = ln(\u03bc) and vu (t) is the scale-dependent[5] vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV) vu = v0 sin \u03b2, v0 = 174GeV . In the basis where the\ncharged lepton mass matrix is made diagonal, we can write the above expresT\nsion as m\u2032LL (t) = vu2 (t)K \u2032 (t) where K \u2032 (t) = VeL K(t)VeL\nis the coefficient of the\ndimension five neutrino mass operators in the basis where the charged lepton\n3\n\n\fmass matrix is diagonal. The approximate analytical solution of the relevant\nRGEs in MSSM, is given by the following form\nm\u2032LL (t0 ) = R.diag(1, 1, \u03b1).m\u2032LL (tu ).diag(1, 1, \u03b1)\n9\n\n9\n\nWe have the expressions R = e 10 Ig1 (t0 ) e 2 Ig2 (t0 ) \u2243 1,\nwhere the approximate solution is [4,5,6]\nr = 1 \u2212 (mt /Mu )(1+tan\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b1 = e\u2212t\u03c4 (t0 ) = 1 \u2212 r\n\n\u221a\n\u03b2)(m\u03c4 /2 2\u03c0v)2\n\nwith v = 245.4GeV . The low-energy solar mass splitting \u2206m2sol can be expressed\nin terms of high energy solar mass splitting \u2206m221 and the radiative correction\neffect \u03b4rad as\n\u2206m2sol = \u2206m221 + \u03b4rad , \u03b4rad = \u22124r|m1 |2 sin2 2\u03b823 cos 2\u03b821 .\n\n(7)\n\nIn MSSM the quantity r is positive and thus we have \u2206m2sol < \u2206m221 . For\nexample, We obtain the numerical values \u03b4rad = \u22120.96\u00d710\u22125eV 2 corresponding\nto the CaseIII in Table-1. The mass ratio |m2 |/|m1 | also decreases with energy\nscale. The model is stable under radiative corrections.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.Murayama,hep-ph/0201022;A.de\nPhys.Lett.B490,125(2000).\n\nGouvea,A.Friedland,H.Murayama,\n\n[2] Q.R.Ahmad et al,Phys.
