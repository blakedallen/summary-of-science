The approach which is based on ideas from Bayesian statistics involves creating an ensemble\nof exchange-correlation functionals by comparing with an experimental database of binding energies\nfor molecules and solids. Fluctuations within the ensemble can then be used to estimate errors\nrelative to experiment on calculated quantities like binding energies, bond lengths, and vibrational\nfrequencies. It is demonstrated that the error bars on energy differences may vary by orders of\nmagnitude for different systems in good agreement with existing experience.\nPACS numbers: 71.15.Mb, 31.15.Ew, 02.50.Ng, 68.43.Bc\n\nOver the past few decades the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT)[1] to predict structures, energetics, and other properties of atomic-scale systems has\nspread to many different fields and the number of applications has grown enormously. Today applications may\nvary from studies of chemical reactions in heterogeneous\ncatalysis[2] through geophysical investigations of melting\nat the physical conditions of the Earth's core[3, 4] to\nstudies of biomolecular systems like DNA[5, 6]. The general usefulness of the calculations lies in their unbiased\n\"first principles\" character and the relatively high degree\nof predictive power and reliability which has been established. With respect to the latter, it is however often\ndifficult to assess directly to which extent a calculated\nquantity \u2013 this being a molecular bond length or some\nother property \u2013 is to be trusted. In practice the evaluation often falls back exclusively on the experience and\nacquired insight of the person performing the calculation.\nIn this letter we present a scheme for systematic error evaluation within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) DFT. The scheme is based on ideas from\nBayesian statistics[7] in which an ensemble of models or\nmodel parameters are assigned probabilities by comparing to a database of experimental results. The ensemble\ngenerated can then subsequently be used to estimate error bars on model predictions within the considered class\nof models. The scheme is simple to apply and amounts in\nthe end to only a few additional non-self-consistent evaluations of exchange-correlation functionals. In spirit, it\nis in fact close to a rather common practice within the\nfield of DFT-GGA calculations: To asses the validity of\na calculated DFT-GGA result it is common to try out\ndifferent versions of the GGA-functional or perhaps to\ncompare with a local-density approximation (LDA) result. The scheme presented here provides a systematic\nframework for such an approach.\nThe statistical approach we use is inspired by Bayesian\nstatistics [7] and was further developed in the context of\nmodeling complex biomedical networks [8] and for con-\n\nstruction of interatomic potentials [9]. The main ingredients in the approach are a model M which is given\nby a set of parameters \u03b8, and a database D. In our\ncase the model will be a GGA-type exchange-correlation\nfunctional described through a number of parameters \u03b8\nand the database D will consist of experimental atomization/cohesive energies Ekexp for a collection of molecules\nand solids (details below). We now define a probability\ndistribution in the space of model parameters (given the\nchoice of model and the database) through\nP (\u03b8|M D) \u223c exp(\u2212C(\u03b8)/T ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C denotes\na standard least-squares cost function\nP\nC(\u03b8) = 12 k (Ek (\u03b8) \u2212 Ekexp )2 with Ek (\u03b8) being the atomization/cohesive energy of system k in the database\ncalculated with the parameters \u03b8. The \"effective temperature\" T determines the spread of the ensemble. In simple fitting procedures only the best-fit parameters \u03b8b.f. ,\nwhich are obtained when the cost function takes on its\nminimal value Cb.f. , are considered. Here, in contrast, a\nwhole ensemble of parameter sets are considered leading\nto a spread of values on model predictions. Following\nRef. 9, we take the value of the effective temperature to\nbe given by the minimal (best fit) value of the cost function Cb.f. as T = 2Cb.f. /Np , where Np is the number of\nparameters. For a harmonic cost function each parameter will then on the average contribute an additional cost\nof T /2 = Cb.f. /Np so that the ensemble will probe model\nparameters where the cost function is in the range from\nthe minimal value Cb.f. up to of the order a few times\nthis value. This choice was demonstrated to work well\nin the case of error estimation for interatomic potentials\n[9].\nThe model we shall consider is GGA-DFT [10] where\nthe exchange functional is a local function of the density n and its dimensionless gradient s = |\u2207n|/(2kF n)\n(n = kF3 /(3\u03c0 2 )). Several suggestions for different mathematical forms of the exchange-functional within GGA\nexist[10, 11, 12]. A commonly used class of these in-\n\n\f2\ncluding PW-91[13], PBE[11], revPBE[14] and RPBE[15]\ndiffer by only the choice of the so-called enhancement\nfactor Fx (s) in the exchange energy Ex :\nZ\nEx [n] = dr n(r)\u01ebLDA\n(n(r))Fx (s),\n(2)\nx\nwhere \u01ebLDA\n(n) = \u22123kF /(4\u03c0) (for a spin polarized denx\nsity we have Ex [n\u2191 , n\u2193 ] = (Ex [2n\u2191 ] + Ex [2n\u2193 ])/2). The\nenhancement factors for PBE and RPBE are shown in\nFig. 1. In the following we shall expand the enhancement factor as\n\u00132i\u22122\n\u0012\nNp\nX\ns\n,\n(3)\n\u03b8i\nFx (s) =\n1+s\ni=1\nregarding the \u03b8's as free parameters. We use three parameters (Np = 3) which a train/test check for our database\nhas shown to give the optimal fit without over-fitting.\nThe model space could be extended in future work to\ninclude a fraction of exact exchange as for the B3LYP\nfunctional[16].\n2\n1.8\n\nRPBE\n\nbest-fit\n\nFx(s)\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\nPBE\n1\n0.8\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\ns\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFIG. 1: Exchange enhancement factors as a function of dimensionless electron density gradient. The gray lines show enhancement factors drawn from the ensemble exp(\u2212C(\u03b8)/T ).\nThe dashed, dotted and full lines show enhancement factors\nfor PBE, RPBE and the best fit respectively.\n\nThe database we use consists of the experimental atomization energies of the molecules H2 , LiH, CH4 , NH3 ,\nOH, H2 O, HF, Li2 , LiF, Be2 , C2 H2 , C2 H4 , HCN, CO,\nN2 , NO, O2 , F2 , P2 and Cl2 and the experimental cohesive energies (per atom) of the solids Na, Li, Si, C, SiC,\nAlP, MgO, NaCl, LiF, Cu and Pt. In the cost function\nall systems in the database appear with the same unit\nweight.\nAll calculations are performed with a real-space multigrid DFT code[17] using the projector augmented wave\nmethod[18] to describe the core regions. All calculated\nenergy differences have been converged to an accuracy\nbetter than 50 meV with respect to number of grid\n\npoints, unit-cell size (for the molecules and atoms) and\nnumber of k-points (for the solids). The electron density\nis calculated self-consistently using the PBE-functional\nand the evaluation of the exchange-correlation energy for\nother enhancement factors are performed using the PBE\ndensity. This is a very good approximation due to the\nvariational principle. Energies are calculated at the calculated equilibrium bond distances.\nSince Eq. (3) is linear in the parameters \u03b8, the total\nenergy of a given system will also be linear in \u03b8:\nE(\u03b8) = E0 +\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2206Ei \u03b8i ,\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the coefficients E0 and \u2206Ei only have to be calculated once for each system. It is therefore very fast to\ncalculate energy values for different enhancement factors\nin the ensemble.\nMinimizing the cost function with respect to the\nthree parameters leads to the best-fit enhancement factor shown in Fig. 1 corresponding to the parameters\n\u03b8b.f. = (1.0008, 0.1926, 1.8962). The function is seen to\nfollow quite closely the PBE enhancement factor at low\nvalues of the gradient s. In particular it is nearly one\nin the homogeneous limit (s = 0) which is exclusively a\nresult of the fitting. For s-values greater than 1.5 the\nbest-fit enhancement factor increases more steeply than\nPBE being more similar to the RPBE factor. In Table I\nthe resulting errors are shown for LDA, PBE, RPBE and\nfor the best fit. RPBE performs better on the molecules\nand PBE is better for the solids; the best fit represents\na compromise between the two. We would like to stress\nthat the main point of this letter is not to derive an improved functional. Much experience has been acquired\nconcerning how well different GGA functionals work for\ndifferent systems [19, 20, 21] and we do not expect to obtain a large overall improvement within this simple GGA\nframework. But as we shall see in the following the ensemble construction allows for realistic evaluation of the\nerror bars on calculated quantities.\nThe cost function appearing in the probability distribution Eq. (1) is very nearly quadratic in the model parameters in the relevant range of parameter space. We\ncan therefore expand the exponent in the probability distribution as C(\u03b8)/T = const. + 21 \u2206\u03b8T A\u2206\u03b8, where A is\na symmetric matrix. With U being the unitary matrix\nthat diagonalizes A (AU = U \u039b), we can finally write the\nparameters of the enhancement factors in the ensemble\nas\n\u03b8 = \u03b8b.f. + U \u039b\u22121/2 \u03b1\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03b11\n0.066 0.055 \u22120.034\n\uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= \u03b8b.f. + \uf8ed\u22120.812 0.206 0.007 \uf8f8 \uf8ed\u03b12 \uf8f8 , (5)\n\u03b13\n1.996 0.082 0.004\nwhere the \u03b11 , \u03b12 , and \u03b13 are stochastic variables which\nare Gaussian distributed with unit width: P(\u03b1i ) \u223c\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: Errors in DFT atomization energies and cohesive\nenergies (in eV) relative to experiment.

Considering O as a function of \u03b8 the BEE is\nevaluated as\nv\nu\nN\nu1 X\n2\n(O(\u03b8\u03bc ) \u2212 Obest-fit ) ,\n(6)\n\u03c3BEE (O) = t\nN \u03bc=1\nIn the simple case where the observable is approximately linear in the parameters \u03b8 the BEE can be calculated withoutP\nexplicitly generating an ensemble through\n\u03c3BEE (O) = ( 3i=1 (\u2202O/\u2202\u03b1i )2 )1/2 and Eq. (5). Further\ndetails can be found in our implementation of the approach in the Atomistic Simulation Environment[27].\nThe ensemble in Eq. (6) is around the best-fit enhancement factor corresponding to \u03b1i = 0. However, considering that the ensemble of enhancement factors (Fig. 1)\nis quite wide compared with the difference between for\nexample the PBE and the best-fit functional it seems\nreasonable to alternatively apply the fluctuations around\neither the PBE or RPBE functional.\nIt is useful to consider the ratio (Obest-fit \u2212\nOexp )/\u03c3BEE (O) of the actual error relative to the estimate. For any given observable in a particular system\n\nFIG. 2: Histograms of actual error relative to the BEE\n(Obest-fit \u2212Oexp )/\u03c3BEE (O) for different quantities. Top: atomization/cohesive energies. Middle: bond lengths and lattice\nconstants. Bottom: vibrational frequencies and bulk moduli.\nThe dashed lines show the expected normal distribution. Experimental numbers are taken from Refs. [19, 21, 26, 28, 29].\n\nIn Fig. 2 we show histograms of the relative error for\ndifferent observables for all the (molecular and solid) systems in the database. The upper panel shows the distribution in the case of the atomization/cohesive energies.\nAs can be seen the distribution agrees quite well with a\nGaussian distribution of unit width indicating that the\nerror estimates are in fact reasonable for the binding energies. The individual standard deviations for the cohesive\nenergies are in the range from 0.09 eV for Na to 0.75 eV\nfor Al and for the atomization energies the range is from\n0.07 eV for Li2 to 0.60 eV for C2 H4 . As an example, the\nGGA estimate of the cohesive energy of Na (experimental value is 1.11 eV) is 1.02 \u00b1 0.09 eV. The middle panel\nin Fig. 2 shows the relative error histogram for the bond\nlengths (for both molecules and solids) and relative errors for the molecular frequencies and solid bulk moduli\nis shown in the lower panel[30]. For both distributions,\nwe see that the BEE's give reasonable estimates of the\nactual errors.\nIt is well-known for experienced users of DFT calculations that the reliability with which energy differences\ncan be calculated vary dramatically depending on the\nparticular system. The BEE catches this behavior as\ncan be seen for example by comparing the cohesive energy and the bcc-fcc structural energy difference for bulk\ncopper (Fig. 3). The BEE for the cohesive energy is 0.5\neV while the error bar on the structural energy differ-\n\n\fEbcc\u2212Efcc\n\n4\n\n0.4\n\nbulk Cu\n\n0.2\n\nRPBE\n\n0\n2.5\n\n0.04\n0.02\n\nexp\n\n2\n\nbest-fit\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPBE\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nEbridge\u2212Etop\n\nEc\n0.2\n\nCO/Cu(100)\n\nRPBE\n\nPBE\n0\n-0.2\n-1.5\n\nexp\n\nbest-fit\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nEtop\nFIG. 3: Upper panel: Calculated ensemble for cohesive energy\n(x-axis) and bcc-fcc energy difference (y-axis) for a copper\ncrystal.

Values for the experimentally preferred\nstates[22, 31] (fcc and top) are indicated by vertical dotted\nlines. Units: eV.\n\nence is two orders of magnitudes smaller (4 meV). The\nsmall structural energy difference is seen to be significantly greater than zero. The high reliability with which\nsmall structural energy differences can be calculated for\nbulk metals is confirmed by the fact that for almost all\nmetals the correct equilibrium structures are predicted\nfrom the calculations[32].\nFor chemisorption systems the BEE for the energy difference between chemisorption at two difference surface\nsites may also be somewhat smaller than the error bar\nfor the total chemisorption energy as illustrated in the\ncase of CO on Cu(100) in Fig. 3. However as can be seen\nfrom the figure the error bar on the site-preference is so\nlarge that the preferred chemisorption site cannot be reliably determined. This is in good agreement with the\nfact that for a number of CO-metal chemisorption systems DFT-GGA calculations do in fact predict a wrong\nchemisorption site[33].\nIt should be noted that in general the error estimates\ndepend on both the choice of database and the class of\nmodels (here the GGA's). This means that if some piece\nof physics is not present in the database or if the model is\ncompletely unable to describe a particular feature unrealistic estimates may occur. For example all GGA's are\nunable to properly describe the long-range van der Waals\ninteractions and hence the BEE's will be unrealistic for\nthat type of interactions.\nWe further note, that it may be possible to reduce the\n\nerror bars in some cases by picking a database focused on\na particular type of systems. Using for example only the\nsubset of molecular systems in our database a different\nbest-fit functional is obtained where the mean absolute\nerror is only 0.15 eV compared to the 0.24 eV in Table\nI. With this functional the fluctuations and hence the\nBEEs will be reduced by almost a factor of two. However,\napplying this functional to bulk metals would lead to\nlarger errors which would be underestimated.\nSummarizing, we propose a simple way to estimate a\nlarge portion of the systematic error for DFT-GGA calculations, requiring only a few extra non-self-consistent\nenergy calculations to calculate the error bars of any observable which is a function of energies.\nWe acknowledge support from the Carlsberg Foundation and the Danish Center for Scientific Computing\nthrough Grant No. HDW-1101-05.\n\n[1] P.
