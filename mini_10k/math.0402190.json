We also show that Berger's conjecture implies Geller's\nconjecture, and hence verify it in many new cases.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet A be an one-dimensional local integral domain which is essentially of finite\ntype over a field K of characteristic zero. Let F denote the field of fractions\nof A. It is easy to check that the map K1 (A) \u2212\u2192 K1 (F ) is injective. It was\na general question if the map K2 (A) \u2212\u2192 K2 (F ) is also injective, which is now\nknown not to be true in general. Quillen's proof of Gersten's conjecture implies\nthat this is true if A is a regular local ring. Dennis and Sherman ([G]) showed\nthat this map is not injective when A is the local ring of the singular point of\nthe cuspidal curve Spec(K[t2 , t3 ]). The general picture about singular rings is\ngiven by the following conjecture of Geller ([G]).\nConjecture. (Geller) Let A be a local one-dimensional domain with field\nof fractions F . Then A is regular if and only if the map K2 (A) \u2212\u2192 K2 (F ) is\ninjective.\nThis conjecture was verified by Geller ([G]) when A is noetherian, equicharacteristic, characteristic zero, and is also seminormal with finite normalisation.\nIn the same article, Dennis and Sherman verify it for cuspidal rings of the type\nK[t2 , t3 ] as described above. The conjecture is still unknown in almost all other\ncases. Our first aim in this paper is to formulate an Artinian version of this\nconjecture, and to show that this conjecture implies Geller's conjecture. Before we state the conjecture, let us recall that that an algebra over a field K is\ncalled a principal ideal algebra if every ideal of A is principal. We call A to\nbe finite-dimensional if it is finite over K. In this paper, we will have standing\nassumption that K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and all\n\n1\n\n\fK-algebras are essentially of finite type over K. Our Artinian version of above\nconjecture is\nConjecture. (AGC) If A is a subalgebra of a finite-dimensional principal ideal\nK-algebra B such that the map K2 (A) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B) is injective, then A is also a\nprincipal ideal algebra.\n\nWe shall call this 'Artinian Geller Conjecture' (AGC). Our first result in this\npaper states\nTheorem 1.1 With A and K as above, Artinian Geller Conjecture implies\nGeller's Conjecture.\nIn the other part of this paper, our aim is to relate these conjectures with differential forms in order to verify Geller's conjecture in some cases. In this regard,\nwe recall a similar conjecture about the module of Kahler differentials on onedimensional local domain over a field of char. 0.\nConjecture. (Berger) Let A be an one-dimensional local domain which is\nessentially of finite type over a field K of characteristic zero. Then A is regular\nif and only if the module of Kahler differentials \u03a9A/K is torsion-free.\n\nThis conjecture was formulated by R. Berger in [B1] almost forty years ago.\nThis has been verified in many cases (listed below) by various people though it\nis still unknown in general.\nTheorem 1.2 If A is as above, with K algebraically closed, then Berger's Conjecture implies Geller's Conjecture.\nBefore we state our corollary to this theorem, we recall that ([B2]) a local\nring A as above is called an 'almost' complete intersection if the first quadratic\ntransform of A is a complete intersection. The common examples are local rings\nof plane curves or a curve through a smooth point of a surface.\nCorollary 1.3 Geller's Conjecture is true in each of the following cases.\n(i) A is seminormal (also proved by Geller),\n(ii) M3 B \u2282 A, where B is the normalisation of A with Jacobson radical M,\n(iii) A is a complete intersection,\n(iv) A is almost complete intersection,\n(v) A is the local ring of the vertex of an 1-dimensional graded ring with vertex\nas only singular point,\n2\n\n\f(vi) A has analyitically smoothable curve singularities,\n\u0001\n(vii) A has multiplicity < m\n2 , where m is the embedding dimension of A, and\n(viii) A has deviation \u2264 3.\nRemark. We mention here that the condition of the field K being algebraically\nclosed is only a technical one and one can reduce the general case to this case\nusing the techniques of [G] and [CGW]. In fact, it is shown in [CGW] that one\ncan always assume K to be algebraically closed to prove Berger's conjecture.\n\n2\n\nSome results on Hochschild and Cyclic homology\n\nIn this section, we aim to prove some results concerning Hochschild and cyclic\nhomology of rings. We refer the reader to [LO] for basic notions of Hochschild\nand Cyclic homology of rings. Let k be field of characteristic 0, and we assume\nall k-algebras to be commutative. For any k-algebra maps A \u2212\u2192 B, Loday\n([LO]) also defines the relative Hochschild homology HH\u2217k (A, B) over k as the\nhomology groups of the chain complex Cone(C\u2022 (A) \u2212\u2192 C\u2022 (B)), where C\u2022 (A)\ndenotes the Hochschild complex of A etc. For an ideal I of A, HH\u2217k (A, I) will\nbe the relative homology of A and A/I. One defines relative Cyclic homology\nin similar way by taking the cone over the total cyclic complexes of the two\nalgebras. We also have the notion of relative K-theory as defined, for example\nin [CS]. There are Chern class maps Ki (A) \u2212\u2192 HHik (A), (Dennis trace maps)\nand by functoriality of fibrations of K-theory spectra and Hochschild homology,\none also has Chern class maps from relative K-theory to relative Hochschild\nhomology ([LO]), which are compatible with long exact sequence of relative\nK-theory and Hochschild homology. It is known that there are natural maps\n\u03a9iA/k \u2212\u2192 HHik (A) and HHik (A) \u2212\u2192 \u03a9iA/k such that the composite is multiplication by i!. In particular, HH1k (A) is same as the module of Kahler differentials\non A over k. For an ideal I of A, let \u03a91(A,I)/k := Ker(\u03a91A/k \u0589 \u03a91A/I/k ). We\nbegin with the following\nLemma 2.1 Let A be a k-algebra which is reduced and and is essentially of\nfinite type over k. Let B be the normalisation of A, and let I be a conducting\nideal for this normalisation. Then, for all sufficiently large n, the map\nHH1k (A, I n ) \u2212\u2192 HH1k (B, I n )\nis injective.\n\n3\n\n\fProof. We use the following commutative diagram of exact sequences.\n0\n//\n\n0\n//\n\nHH2k (A/I n )\nHH2k (A)\n\n// HH k (A, I n )\n1\n\n// \u03a91(A,I)/k\n\n// 0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// HH k (B, I n )\n1\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// \u03a91(B,I)/k\n\n// 0\n\nHH2k (B/I n )\nHH2k (B)\n\nDiagram 1\nIt is enough to show that the vertical maps on the ends are injective. Put\n\u03a91A/k := Ker(\u03a91A/k \u2212\u2192 \u03a91B/k ). This module is supported on V (A/I) and hence\nis annihilated by I n for n >> 0. Thus,\nI n (\u03a91A/k ) = 0 for n >> 0.\n\n(2.1)\n\nFurthermore, since \u03a91(A,I n )/k = I n \u03a91A/k + d(I n ), one has a diagram of exact\nsequences\n0\n\n// d(I n )\n\n// \u03a91(A,I n )/k\n\n0\n\n// d(I n )\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// \u03a91(B,I n )/k\n\n//\n\nI n \u03a91A/k\nd(I n )\u2229I n \u03a91A/k\n\n// 0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n//\n\nI n \u03a91B/k\nd(I n )\u2229I n \u03a91B/k\n\n// 0.\n\nThis gives\nKer(\u03a91(A,I n )/k \u2212\u2192 \u03a91(B,I n )/k ) = Ker(\n\nI n \u03a91A/k\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91A/k\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nI n \u03a91B/k\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91B/k\n\n).\n\nNext, we\nClaim. For n >> 0, I n \u03a91A/k \u0592\u2192 I n \u03a91B/k .\nTo prove the claim, notice that \u03a91A/k is a finitely generated A-module, and hence\nby Artin-Rees theorem, there exists c > 0 such that for all n > c,\n(I n \u03a91A/k \u2229 \u03a91A/k ) \u2282 I n\u2212c (I c \u03a91A/k \u2229 \u03a91A/k ).\nIn particular, we get\n(I n \u03a91A/k \u2229 \u03a91A/k ) \u2282 I n\u2212c (\u03a91A/k ) = 0 for n >> 0 by 2.1,\nwhich proves the claim.\nUsing this claim, we obtain\nKer(\n\nI n \u03a91A/k\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91A/k\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nI n \u03a91B/k\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91B/k\n4\n\n)=\n\nI n \u03a91A/k \u2229 (d(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91B/k )\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91A/k\n\n\f=\n\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91A/k\nd(I n ) \u2229 I n \u03a91A/k\n\n= 0.\n\nThis, together with 2.1 implies that the right-most vertical map in Diagram 1\nis injective for all sufficiently large n.\nBefore we start proving the injectivity of the vertical map on the left, we\nmake the convention that all Hochschild and cyclic homologies will be considered\nover the given base field k in the remaining part of this lemma, and we will\nsuppress this field k. We use the Hodge decomposition (or \u03bb-decomposition)\n([LO] or [C]) on Hochschild homology to get\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nHH2 (A/I n )\nHH2 (A/I n ) HH2 (A/I n )\n=\n\u2295\n.\n(1)\n(2)\nHH2 (A)\nHH2 (A)\nHH2 (A)\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nBut, for any k-algebra A, one has HH2 (A) = D1k (A), and HH2 (A) = \u03a92A/k\nby [LO] (chapter 4), where D\u2217k (A) denotes the Andre-Quillen homology of A\nover k. Moreover, for any ideal I \u2282 A, the map \u03a92A/k \u2212\u2192 \u03a92(A/I)/k is surjective.\nDk (A/I n )\n\nn\n\n2 (A/I )\n= 1Dk (A) and similarly for B. Now, from [LO]\nThus, we get HH\nHH2 (A)\n1\n(chapter 3), we have a diagram of exact sequences\n\nD1k (A)\n\n// Dk (A/I n )\n1\n\n// DA (A/I n )\n1\n\n\u000f\u000f\nD1k (B)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// Dk (B/I n )\n1\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// DB (B/I n ),\n1\n\nand D1A (A/I n ) = I n /I 2n = D1B (B/I n ). This proves the required injectivity. \u0003\n\nLemma 2.2 Let A be a regular ring which is essentially of finite type over a\nfield K of char. zero. Let I \u2282 A be an invertible ideal. Then, for any subfield\nk \u2282 K, and any n \u2265 0, the natural map\nHHnk (A/I 2 )\nHHnk (A/I)\n\u2212\u2192\nHHnk (A)\nHHnk (A)\nis zero.\nProof. Since Hochschild homology commutes with localisation, we can assume\nthat R is a regular local ring and I = (t) is a principal ideal. Let A 7\u2192 D\u2217k (A)\ndenote the Andre-Quillen homology functor. Then, these homology groups are\ngiven by\nD\u2217k (A) := H\u2217 (LA/k ),\n\n5\n\n\fwhere LA/k denotes the cotangent complex of A over k ([LO]). We first claim\nthat Dik (A) = 0 for i > 0, and Dik (A/I) = 0 for i > 1.\nFirst, notice that since k is of char. zero, Dik (K) is the direct limit of Dik (L),\nwhere L is a subfield of K and finitely generated over k. Moreover, L can\nbe viewed as a finite extension of a purely transcendental extension (of finite\ndegree) over k. But, the Andre- Quillen homology of finite extension vanishes in\nchar. 0, and a purely transcendental extension of finite degree is a localisation of\na polynomial ring over k for which the Andre-Quillen Homology again vanishes.\nSince Andre-Quillen homology commutes with direct limits ([Q]), we conclude\nthat Dik (K) = 0 for i > 0.

For any subring R \u0592\u2192 A, let D\u2217R (A, I) be the relative Andre-Quillen homology defined as the homology groups of the complex Ker(LA/R \u0589 L(A/I)/R ).\nThese groups fit into long exact sequence of relative Andre-Quillen homology. As\nR,(1)\nin [LO], there are natural maps DiR (A, I) \u2212\u2192 HHi+1 (A, I). Comparing thse\ngroups using long exact sequences of Andre-Quillen homology and Hochschild\nR,(1)\nhomology, and using the isomorphism DiR (A) \u223c\n= HHi+1 (A), one gets isomor\u223c HH R,(1) (A, I) for all i \u2265 0.

The bottom sequence is exact on the left since B is\nsmooth over K. A diagram chase now shows that all the rows are exact on the\nleft. Now, lemma 2.1 and Snake lemma complete the proof.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.6 Under the conditions of lemma 2.4, the natural map\nHH1k (A, B, I n ) \u2212\u2192 HH1k (A, B, I)\n9\n\n\fof double relative Hochschild homology groups is zero for all sufficiently large n.\nProof.

In view of the above lemma, it's enough to show that the natural\nmap HH1k (A, B, I n ) \u2212\u2192 HC1k (A, B, I n ) is surjective for all n.

We point out here that it is already known that the map HC0k (A, B, I 2 ) \u2192\nHC0k (A, B, I) is zero ([CGW]).\nWe conclude this section with the following two lemmas.\nLemma 2.8 Let A be an one-dimensional local domain, essentially of finite\ntype over an algebraically closed field of char. 0, let B be the normalisation of\nA. Let k \u2282 K be any subfield. Then the natural map\nKer(HH1k (A) \u2192 HH1k (B)) \u2212\u2192 Ker(HH1K (A) \u2192 HH1K (B))\nis an isomorphism.\n10\n\n\fProof. We first observe that HH1k (A) = \u03a91A/k and similarly for B. Thus, we\ncan work with Kahler differentials. The above map is already injective, so we\nneed to show only surjectivity. Note that since B is regular, \u03a91B/k is a free\nB-module (not necessarily finitely generated). Thus, the map \u03a91K/k \u2297K A \u0592\u2192\n\u03a91K/k \u2297K B \u2192 \u03a91B/k is injective. Furthermore, since K is algebraically closed,\nthe map \u03a91K/k \u2192 \u03a91A/k \u2192 \u03a91K/k is naturally split. In particular, \u03a91K/k is\nnaturally a direct summand of \u03a91A/k .\nPut \u03a91A/k = Ker(\u03a91A/k \u2192 \u03a91B/k ). We define \u03a91A/K similarly. Let F denote the\nfield of fractionas of A. Then it is easy to see that \u03a91A/k = Tor1A (F/A, \u03a91A/k ), and\none has similar interpretation for \u03a91A/K . This follows because the map \u03a91B/k \u2212\u2192\n\u03a91F/k is injective. Thus, we need to show that the map Tor1A (F/A, \u03a91A/k ) \u2212\u2192\nTor1A (F/A, \u03a91A/K ) is surjective. But, using the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a91K/k \u2297K A \u2212\u2192 \u03a91A/k \u2212\u2192 \u03a91A/K \u2212\u2192 0,\none gets a long exact sequence\n\u03c6\n\nTor1A (F/A, \u03a91A/k ) \u2192 Tor1A (F/A, \u03a91A/K ) \u2192 \u03a91K/k \u2297K F/A \u2192 \u03a91A/k \u2297A F/A.\nHence, it is enough to show that \u03c6 is injective. However, one has a factorisation\n\u03a91K/k \u2297K F/A \u2192 \u03a91A/k \u2297A F/A \u2192 A\u2297K (\u03a91A/k \u2297A F/A). Thus, it is enough to\nshow that the composite map is injective. However,\n\u03a91K/k \u2297K F/A = (\u03a91K/k \u2297K A)\u2297A F/A \u0592\u2192 (\u03a91A/k \u2297K A)\u2297A F/A\n\u223c\n= A\u2297K (\u03a91A/k \u2297A F/A).\nHere, the injective arrow follows because \u03a91K/k is naturally a direct summand\nof \u03a91A/k as observed before. This proves the desired injectivity.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.9 Let A and B be as in lemma 2.8. Let m and M denote the Jacobson radicals of A and B respectively. Then the natural map\nKer(HH1k (A, m) \u2192 HH1k (B, M)) \u2212\u2192 Ker(HC1k (A, m) \u2192 HC1k (B, M)).\nis injective.\nProof. We consider the following diagram of exact sequences coming from the\nSBI-sequence\n0\n\n// HC k (A, m)\n0\n\n// HH k (A, m)\n\n// HC k (A, m)\n1\n\n// 0\n\n0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// HC k (B, M)\n0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// HH k (B, M)\n1\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// HC k (B, M)\n1\n\n// 0,\n\n1\n\n11\n\n\fwhere the first arrow from left in the bottom sequence is injective because the\ncomposite map M = HC0k (B, M) \u2212\u2192 HH1k (B, M) \u2212\u2192 \u03a91B/k is injective as B is\nregular. Also, HC0k (A, m) \u223c\n= m, again using the long exact sequence for relative\ncyclic homology. Thus the left-most vertical map is just the inclusion m \u0592\u2192 M.\nA diagram chase now proves the lemma.\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nMayer-Vietoris sequences in K-theory and Cyclic\nhomology\n\nOur goal in this section is to establish some Mayer-Vietoris type exact sequences\nin K-theory and cyclic homology. These sequences will be one of our main tools\nto prove main theorems. Let A be an one-dimensional reduced local ring, which\nis essentially of finite type over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic\nzero. Let m denote the Jacobson radical of A. Let B be the normalisation of\nA with the Jacobson radical M. Note that B is a direct product of regular\nsemi-local domains. Then, for any radical ideal I of B, one has a fibration of\nK-theory spectra\nK(B, I) \u2212\u2192 K(B, M) \u2212\u2192 K(B/I, M/I).\n\nLemma 3.1 Let A be a reduced local ring as above with the maximal ideal m,\nand let B be the normalisation of A with Jacobson radical M. Then for any\nconducting ideal I, one has 'Mayer-Vietoris' exact sequences\nK2 (A, m) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B, M) \u2295 K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I) \u2212\u2192 0.\nHC1 (A, m) \u2212\u2192 HC1 (B, M) \u2295 HC1 (A/I, m/I) \u2212\u2192 HC1 (B/I, M/I) \u2212\u2192 0.\nProof.

Similar argument holds in\nthe second diagram. This also proves the surjectivity of the last maps in the\nlemma. Now a diagram chase shows that it is enough to prove that the slanted\narrows in both diagrams are surjective. However, we know that by [GO] and\n[CO], there are isomorphisms\nK3 (B/I, M/I) \u223c\n= HC2 (B/I, M/I), and K1 (A, B, I) \u223c\n= HC0 (A, B, I).\nHere, all Hochschild and Cyclic homologies are taken with respect to the field\nof rational numbers Q. Furthermore, one has a commutative diagram\nHH2 (B/I, M/I)\n\n// HH0 (A, B, I)\n\n\u000f\u000f\nHC2 (B/I, M/I)\n\n// HC0 (A, B, I),\n\nwhere the right eqaulity follows from the SBI-sequence of double relative Hochschild\nand Cyclic homology ([LO]) or by direct computation. But, from the proof of\nTheorem 1.2 of [CGW], the map HH2 (B/I, M/I) \u2212\u2192 HH0 (A, B, I) is surjective. This proves desired surjectivity of both the slanted arrows.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.2 With notations as in the above lemma, the maps\nKer(K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (B, M)) \u2212\u2192 Ker(K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I)),\nKer(HC1 (A, m) \u2192 HC1 (B, M)) \u2212\u2192 Ker(HC1 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 HC1 (B/I, M/I))\nare surjective.\nProof. Follows directly from the 'Mayer-Vietoris' sequence of the lemma.\nRemark. The second part of the corollary was also established in [CGW].\n\n13\n\n\u0003\n\n\fLemma 3.3 Under the hypothesis of lemma 3.1, the map\nK3 (B/I 2 , M/I 2 )\nK3 (B/I, M/I)\n\u2212\u2192\nK3 (B, M)\nK3 (B, M)\nis zero.\nProof. Note that K3 (B/I, M/I) = K3nil (B/I, M/I), and the latter is a Qvector space. Hence, both groups above remain unchanged even after we mod\nout torsion part of K3 (B, M). Using Adam's operations on rational relative\nK-theory as in [L] (see also [C]), one has eigenspace decomposition\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nK3 (B/I n , M/I n ) = K3 (B/I n , M/I n ) \u2295 K3 (B/I n , M/I n ).\n(3)\n\nFurther, K3 (B/I n , M/I n ) = K3M (B/I n , M/I n ), where the latter is the relative Milnor K-group as defined by Levine ([L]). By naturality of eigenspace\ndecomposition, one gets\n(2)\n\nK3 (B/I n , M/I n ) \u223c K3 (B/I n , M/I n ) K3M (B/I n , M/I n )\n\u2295\n.\n=\n(2)\n(3)\nK3 (B, M)\nK3 (B, M)\nK3 (B, M)\nNow, B is a direct product of regular semi-local domains in which all height 1\nprime ideals are pricipal, and since M is the product of all maximal ideals, we\nsee the pair (B, M) satisfies the MV-Property of Levine. We\nClaim. There is a surjection\nK3M (B, M) \u0589 Ker(K3M (B) \u0589 K3M (B/M)).\nFor this, we use the eigen pieces of the long exact rel. K-theory sequence, to\nget exact sequence\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nK3 (B, M) \u2212\u2192 Ker(K3 (B) \u2212\u2192 K3 (B/M)).\nBut all these are corresponding Milnor K-groups by [L]. This proves the claim.\n(3)\nWe point out here that the isomorphism K3M (B, M) \u223c\n= K3 (B, M)\n= F 3 K3 (B, M) \u223c\nis known only after we mod out two torsion elements. But as remarked in the\nbeginning of the proof of the lemma, this does not affect the statement of the\nlemma.\nNow, using this claim and the the fact that the surjection B/I n \u0589 B/M\nsplits, one has a diagram of exact sequences\n\n0\n\nK3M (B, M)\n\n// K M (B)\n3\n\n// K M (B/M)\n3\n\n// 0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K M (B/I n , M/I n )\n3\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K M (B/I n )\n3\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K M (B/M)\n3\n\n// 0,\n\n14\n\n\fwhich in turn gives a surjection\nK3M (B, M) \u0589 K3M (B/I n , M/I n ).\nApplying this in the eigenspace decomposition above, we obtain\nK3 (B/I n ,M/I n )\nK3 (B,M)\n\n(2)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nK3 (B/I n ,M/I n )\n(2)\n\nK3 (B,M)\n(1)\nHC2 (B/I n ,M/I n )\n\n(2)\nK3 (B,M)\n(1)\nn\nn\ni HC2 (BMi /I ,Mi /I )\n(2)\nK3 (B,M)\nQ\nr\n(\n[ti ]/ti i ,(ti ))\u2297HH0\nD\ni 1\n(2)\nK3 (B,M)\n\nQ\n\nQQ\n\nQ (k)\n\n,\n\nwhere the sum is taken over maximal ideals of B. Here, DQ (A) denotes the\nAndre-Quillen homology of a Q-algebra A ([LO]) and the last equality follows\nfrom the computation of the Cyclic homology of truncated polynomial algebras\nin ([LO], sec. 4.6). Now, the proof of the lemma follows from the following\nSublemma 3.4 Let Br denote the truncated polynomial ring Q[t]/(tr ). Then,\nQ\nQ\nthe map D1 (B2r ) \u2212\u2192 D1 (Br ) is zero.\nProof. Since we are dealing with rational coefficients, we shall ignore the index\nr)\nQ in this proof. Note that D1 (Br ) = DD1((B\nQ[t]) (Q[t] is smooth over Q), which in\n1\n\n(1)\n\nturn is same as\n\nHH2 (Br )\n(1)\n\nHH2 (Q[t])\n\nby [LO]. But the map\n\nHH2 (B2r )\nHH2 (Br )\n\u2212\u2192\nHH2 (Q[t])\nHH2 (Q[t])\nis zero by lemma 2.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.5 Let F2 (B, I) denote Ker(K2 (B, I) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B, M)). Then the\nmap F2 (B, I 2 ) \u2212\u2192 F2 (B, I) is zero.\nProof. This follows once we observe that\nF2 (B, I) =\n\nK3 (B/I, M/I)\n,\nK3 (B, M)\n\nusing the K-theory long exact sequence for the map of pairs (B, I) \u2212\u2192 (B, M),\nand then using above lemma.\n\u0003\nThe following is our main result of this section, which is a stronger version\nof lemma 3.1.\n15\n\n\fTheorem 3.6 Consider the hypothesis of lemma 3.1. Then, there exists a conducting ideal I such that one has 'Mayer-Vietoris' exact sequences\n0 \u2192 K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (B, M) \u2295 K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I) \u2192 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\n0 \u2192 HC1 (A, m) \u2192 HC1 (B, M) \u2295 HC1 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 HC1 (B/I, M/I) \u2192 0.\n(3.5)\nProof. In view of lemma 3.1, we only need to prove injectivity of first maps in\nboth sequences for some conducting ideal I. We shall in fact show that given a\nconducting ideal I, this holds for all sufficiently large powers of I. We fix some\nnotations before beginning the proof. For any conducting ideal I, let\n\\\nF (I) := Ker(K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (A/I, m/I)) Ker(K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (B, M)),\nF (A) := Ker(K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (B, M)), and\n\nF (A/I) := Ker(K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I)).\nThen, lemma 3.1 implies that one has a short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 F (I) \u2212\u2192 F (A) \u2212\u2192 F (A/I) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe consider the diagram of exact sequences\nK2 (A, B, I)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n// F2 (A, I)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K2 (A, I)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\n// K2 (B, I)\n// F2 (B, I)\nNNN\nNNN\nNNN\nN&& \u000f\u000f\u000f\nK1 (A, B, I)\n\n// K2 (A, m)\n\u000f\u000f\n// K2 (B, M)\n\nwhere the groups on the left are as defined in corollary 3.5. First we claim that\nthe slanted arrow in this diagram is surjective. But this follows directly once we\nchase diagram 2 and observe in the proof of lemma 3.1 that the slanted arrow\nin that diagram is surjective. Thus, a diagram chase above gives exact sequence\nK2 (A, B, I) \u2212\u2192 F (I) \u2212\u2192\n\nF2 (B, I) \u03b2I\n\u2212\u2192 K1 (A, B, I) \u2192 0\nF2 (A, I)\n16\n\n\fHowever, we have natural isomorphism K2 (A, B, I) \u223c\n= HC1 (A, B, I) by Cortinas' theorem ([CO]). Using this in this exact sequence, and comparing the resulting sequences for various powers of I, we get a diagram\nHC1 (A, B, I n )\n\n// F (I n )\n\n\u000f\u000f\nHC1 (A, B, I)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// F (I)\n\nF2 (B,I n )\nF2 (A,I n )\n\n//\n\n\u000f\u000f\nF2 (B,I)\nF2 (A,I)\n\n//\n\nBy corollary 3.5, the right vertical map is zero for n \u2265 2, and the left verical\nmap is zero for n >> 0 by corollary 2.7. Let N be an integer such that both\nthese maps are zero. Now, we repeat the same argument in the above diagram\nwith I replaced by J = I N to get a diagram\nHC1 (A, B, J n )\n\n// F (J n )\n\n\u000f\u000f\nHC1 (A, B, J)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// F (J)\n\n\u000f\u000f\nHC1 (A, B, I)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// F (I)\n\nF2 (B,J n )\nF2 (A,J n )\n\n//\n\n\u000f\u000f\n//\n\nF2 (B,J)\nF2 (A,J)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n//\n\nF2 (B,I)\nF2 (A,I) ,\n\nsuch that all the vertical maps on the left and right ends are zero. A diagram\nchase above now shows that for all n >> 0, the map F (I n ) \u2212\u2192 F (I) is zero.\nApplying this in 3.6, we see that F (A) \u2212\u2192 F (A/I n ) is an isomorphism for all\nlarge powers of I. This proves the exactness of first sequence. The case of cyclic\nhomology follows along exactly similar lines. In fact, we have reduced K-theory\nproblem to Cyclic homology problem in the above proof.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.7 Let (A, m) be a reduced one-dimensional local ring, and let B\nbe a reduced semi-local ring containing A and contained in the normalisation of\nA. Let M be the Jacobson radical of B. Then there is a conducting ideal I \u2282 B\nsuch that one has Mayer-Vietoris exact sequences as in Theorem 3.6.\nProof. To prove the injectivity of the map K2 (A, m) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B, M)\u2295K2 (A/I, m/I),\nobserve that we can choose a I to be a conducting ideal for the normalisation\nof A and hence it will also be conducting ideal for A \u2212\u2192 B. This reduces the\nproof to the case when B is the normalisation of A. To prove the exactness of\nthe sequence\nK2 (A, m) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B, M) \u2295 K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I) \u2212\u2192 0,\n17\n\n\fwe use the exact sequence (which always holds) from the Diagram 3\nK1 (A, B, I) \u2212\u2192\n\nK2 (B, M)\nK2 (B/I, M/I)\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192 0\nK2 (A, m)\nK2 (A/I, m/I)\n\nand use the Cortinas' isomorphism K1 (A, B, I) \u223c\n= HC0 (A, B, I) \u223c\n= I/I 2 \u2297 \u03a91B/A ,\nwhich holds even if B is not normal. Now, we copmare this exact sequence for\nI and I 2 and argue as before to finish the proof. The case of Cyclic homology\nis along the similar lines.\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nProofs of main theorems\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Let A be an one-dimensional local domain,\nessentially of finite type over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic\n0. Let m denote the Jacobson radical of A. Let B be the normalisation of A\nwith Jacobson radical M. Let F be the field of fractions of A. Assume that\nthe 'Artinian Geller Conjecture' holds, and A is singular. Since B is a regular\nsemi-local domain, the map K2 (B) \u2212\u2192 K2 (F ) is injective by Quillen's proof of\nGersten conjecture. Hence it suffices to prove that the map K2 (A) \u2212\u2192 K2 (B)\nis not injective. Consider the commutative diagram with exact rows\n0\n\n// K2 (A, m)\n\n// K2 (A)\n\n// K2 (A/m)\n\n// 0\n\n\u000f\u000f\nK2 (B, M)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K2 (A)\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K2 (B/M)\n\n// 0.\n\nDiagram 3\nHere, the map K2 (A, m) \u2212\u2192 K2 (A) is injective since K \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 A/m = K is\nsplit, as K is algebraically closed. By the same reason, the right-most vertical\nmap is injective, since B/M is some copies of K. A diagram chase shows that\nit is enough to show that the left-most vertical map is not injective. We choose\na conducting ideal I for the normalisation such that I \u2282 m2 and moreover, one\nhas the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequences as in Theorem 3.6. Thus, we have\nKer(K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (B, M)) \u223c\n= Ker(K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I)).\n\n(4.7)\n\nUsing the same diagram as above with A (resp. B) replaced with A/I (resp.\nB/I), and obsering that K3 (B/I) \u0589 K3 (B/M), we see that\nKer(K2 (A/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I)) = Ker(K2 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I, M/I)).\n\n18\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fNow, if A is singular, then m is not a principal ideal, and since I \u2282 m2 ,\nNakayama's Lemma implies that m/I is also not a principal ideal in A/I. In\nparticular, A/I is not a principal ideal algebra though it is a subalgebra of\nB/I, which is a principal ideal algebra. Hence by 'Artinian Geller Conjecture',\nKer(K2 (A/I) \u2192 K2 (B/I)) 6= 0. Now, we use 4.8 and then 4.7 to finish the\nproof.\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2. We first observe that for any subfield k \u2282 K,\nk,(1)\nk,(2)\nHH2k (B/M) = HH2 (B/M) \u2295 HH2 (B/M) by the Hodge decomposik,(1)\ntion on Hochschild homology. But HH2 (B/M) = D1k (B/M) = 0 ([C]).\nk,(2)\nAlso, HH2 (B/M) = \u03a92(B/M)/k , and \u03a92B/k \u0589 \u03a92(B/M)/k . In particular,\nHH2k (B) \u0589 HH2k (B/M). Thus, using the long exact sequence for relative\nHochschild homology, we see that\nKer(\u03a91A/k \u2212\u2192 \u03a91B/k ) = Ker(HH1k (A) \u2212\u2192 HH1k (B)) \u223c\n=\nKer(HH1k (A, m) \u2212\u2192 HH1k (B, M)).\nNow, suppose that Berger's conjecture holds, and A is singular. Then the map\nQ\n\u03a91A/K \u2212\u2192 \u03a91B/K is not injective. Hence, by lemma 2.8, the map HH1 (A) \u2192\nQ\nHH1 (B) is not injective, and the above isomorphism implies that the map\nQ\nQ\nHH1 (A, m) \u2192 HH1 (B, M)) is not injective. Now, we use lemma 2.9 to conclude that\nQ\nQ\nKer(HC1 (A, m) \u2212\u2192 HC1 (B, M)) 6= 0.\n(4.9)\nWe choose a conducting ideal I for the normalisation of A so that we have\nMayer-Vietoris exact sequences as in Theorem 3.6. Then we get an isomorphism\nas in 4.7 and also an isomorphism\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nKer(HC1 (A, m) \u2192 HC1 (B, M)) \u223c\n= Ker(HC1 (A/I, m/I) \u2192 HC1 (B/I, M/I)).\n(4.10)\nHowever, by Goodwillie's theorem ([GO]), the maps\nQ\nK2 (A/I, m/I) \u2212\u2192 HC1 (A/I, m/I), and\nQ\nK2 (B/I, M/I)) \u2212\u2192 HC1 (B/I, M/I)\nare isomorphisms. Now, we combine 4.10, 4.8 and 4.7 to conclude that\nKer(K2 (A, m) \u2192 K2 (B, M)) is not zero. But we have seen in diagram 3 that\nthis group injects inside Ker(K2 (A) \u2192 K2 (B)). This proves the theorem.\n\u0003\n\nProof of Corollary 1.3. The corollary follows from Theorem 1.2 since\n19\n\n\fBerger's conjecture has been verified in these cases. For example, (i) and (ii)\nare verified in [CGW], (iii) in [B1], (iv) in [B2], (v) in [S], (vi) in [BA], (vii) in\n[GU], and (viii) in [HW].\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[AH]\n\nL. Avramov, S.
