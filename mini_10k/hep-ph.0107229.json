It is found that photon propagation\nin this system is anisotropic, appearing several massive photon modes and a superluminal transverse\nmode. For small compactification radius a, the superluminal velocity increases logarithmically with\na. At low energies the photon masses lead to an effective confinement of the gauge fields into a (2+1)dimensional manifold transverse to the compactified direction. The system shows a topologically\ninduced directional superconductivity.\n\nIt is well known that the global properties of the space-time, even if it is locally flat, can give rise to new physics.\nThe seminal discovery in this direction is the so called Casimir effect [1], [2].\nA characteristic of quantum field theory in space-time with non-trivial topology is the existence of non-equivalent\ntypes of fields with the same spin [3]. In particular, for a fermion system in space-time which is locally flat but\nwith S 1 \u00d7 R3 topology (i.e. a Minkowskian space with one of the spatial dimensions compactified in a circle S 1 of\nfinite radius a), the nontrivial topology is transferred into periodic boundary conditions for untwisted fermions or\nantiperiodic boundary conditions for twisted fermions [4]\n\u03c8 (t, x, y, z) = \u00b1\u03c8 (t, x, y, z + a)\n\n(1)\n\nDue to polarization effects of untwisted electrons, quantum electrodynamics (QED) in S 1 \u00d7 R3 space-time with\nphotons coupled to untwisted fermions or to a combination of twisted and untwisted fermions is known to have an\nunstable zero vacuum [4], [5]. It can be shown, however, that a constant expectation value of the electromagnetic\npotential along the compactified direction\nA\u03bd = \u039b\u03b4\u03bd3 ,\n\n\u039b=\n\n\u03c0\n(mod 2\u03c0)\nea\n\n(2)\n\nminimizes the effective potential stabilizing the theory. The same stable vacuum solution was found in Ref. [6] in the\ncase of massless QED with periodic fermions on a circle (QED with S 1 \u00d7 R1 topology). Notice that even though such\na vacuum configuration has F\u03bc\u03bd = 0, it cannot be gauged to zero, because the gauge transformation that would be\nneeded does not respect the periodicity of the function space in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 domain. This is a sort of Aharonov-Bohm\neffect which makes A\u03bc a dynamical variable due to the non-simply connected topology of the considered space-time.\nThe non-gauge equivalence between a constant component of the gauge potential (A0 in this case) and zero is also\npresent in QED at finite temperature and/or density, due to the compactification of the time coordinate [7]. The\nminimum of the potential in the statistical case is however at A0 = 0, since only twisted fermions are allowed in\nstatistics. On the other hand, in the electroweak theory with a finite density of fermions, a non-trivial constant\nvacuum A0 is induced by the fermion density and cannot be gauged away [8]. There, in contrast to the system\nconsidered in the present paper, an additional parameter (a leptonic and/or baryonic chemical potential) is needed\nto trigger the non-trivial constant minimum for A0 .\nOur main goal in the present work is to investigate the photon propagation in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 domain. We expect that\nthe non-simply connected character of the space-time may give rise to new physics which would normally be absent\nin the flat space with trivial topology. To understand this in qualitative terms one should have in mind that, thanks\nto the vacuum polarization, the photon exists during part of the time as a virtual e+ e\u2212 \u2212 pair. The virtual pairs can\nthen transfer to the real photon the properties of the quantum vacuum which, as known, depend on the non-trivial\ntopology and boundary conditions of the space under consideration. Thus, to study the photon propagation one needs\nto investigate the effects connected to vacuum polarization in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 space-time.\nThe vacuum polarization in the non-trivial spatial topology S 1 \u00d7 R3 can be influenced by both virtual untwisted\nand twisted e+ e\u2212 \u2212 pairs. The results for twisted fermions can be easily read off the results at finite temperature,\nsince in the Euclidean space the two theories are basically the same after the interchange of the four-space subindexes\n3 \u2194 4. Nevertheless, a different situation occurs with untwisted fermions that has no analogy in the statistical case.\nHenceforth, we concentrate our attention in the untwisted-fermion case.\nAs shown in this paper, when vacuum polarization due to untwisted fermions is considered, various new physical\neffects emerge. First, at very small radius of compactification, the photon propagation is effectively confined to a\nMinkowskian (2 + 1)\u2212dimensional manifold on which only superluminal photons propagate. This means that the\n1\n\n\fphotons moving in such a lower dimensional space can feel the lack of Lorentz symmetry of the general manifold\n(S 1 \u00d7 R3 ) on which the lower dimensional space is embedded, so it is allowed for them to have group velocity larger\nthan the usual Minkowskian velocity c. Another novel feature of our results is that the photon shows an anisotropic\nmagnetic response. This anisotropy gives rise to a directional superconductivity, with the supercurrent flowing in the\ndirection of the compactified direction. The magnetic penetration length has a purely topological character (i.e. it is\na function only of the compactification length a). The results here reported can be of interest for theories with extra\ndimensions on which some of them are compactified [9], and for condensed matter quasi-planar systems [10].\nTo study the photon propagation we should solve the dispersion relations of the electromagnetic modes, which in\nthe low-frequency limit has the general form\nk02 \u2212 k2 + \u03a0(k2 ) = 0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a0(k2 ) accounts for vacuum polarization effects. Different external conditions, as external fields, geometric\nboundary conditions, thermal bath, etc., can modify the vacuum and produce, through \u03a0(k2 ), a variation in the\nspectrum of the photon modes.\nThe solution of the photon dispersion equations (3) can be obtained as the poles of the photon Green's function.\nDue to the explicit Lorentz symmetry breaking in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 topology, in addition to the usual tensor structures k\u03bc\nand g\u03bc\u03bd , a spacelike unit vector pointing along the compactified direction n\u03bc = (0, 0, 0, 1) must be considered. Then,\nthe general structure of the electromagnetic field Green's function is\n\u2206\u03bc\u03bd (k) = P (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\nk\u03bc n\u03bd + n\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u03b1\nk 2 n\u03bc n\u03bd\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n)\n+\nQ[\n\u2212\n] + 4 k\u03bc k\u03bd ,\n+\nk2\nk2\n(k * n)\n(k * n)2\nk\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a gauge fixing parameter corresponding to the covariant gauge condition\ndefined as\nP =\n\nk2\n\n1\n,\n+ \u03a00\n\nQ=\u2212\n\n(k 2\n\n+ \u03a00\n\n) {k 2\n\n1\n\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc\n\n\u03a01\n,\n+ \u03a00 \u2212 \u03a01 [k 2 /(k * n)2 + 1]}\n\n(4)\n= 0, and P and Q are\n\n(5)\n\nThe parameters \u03a00 and \u03a01 are the coefficients of the polarization operator \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd , which in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 space can be\nwritten as\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (k) = \u03a00 (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\nk\u03bc n\u03bd + n\u03bc k\u03bd\nk 2 n\u03bc n\u03bd\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n) + \u03a01 [ 2 \u2212\n]\n+\n2\nk\nk\n(k * n)\n(k * n)2\n\n(6)\n\nFrom (4)-(5) the photon dispersion relations are\nk02 \u2212 k2 + \u03a00 = 0\nk02 \u2212 k2 + (\u03a00 \u2212\n\nb\nk2\n\u03a01 ) = 0\nk32\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n2\n2\nwhere b\nk 2 = k02 \u2212 k\u22a5\nand k\u22a5\n= k12 + k22 . Notice that in addition to the transverse mode associated to Eq. (7) (normally\npresent in Minkowski space-time with trivial topology), a longitudinal mode, Eq. (8), arises here due to the presence\nof the extra coefficient \u03a01 . The situation resembles the finite temperature case. Nevertheless, as discussed below,\nthe physical consequences of the spatial compactification are radically different from those already known at finite\ntemperature.\nSince the compactified OZ-direction distinguishes itself from the other spatial directions, we should separate the\nanalysis for photons propagating along OZ (k\u22a5 = 0), from those propagating perpendicularly to it (k3 = 0).\nThe dispersion relations (7) and (8) for photons propagating perpendicularly to the compactified direction (k3 = 0)\nare found, from Eqs.(6)-(8), to reduce respectively to\n\n2\nk02 \u2212 k\u22a5\n\u2212\n\nb\nk2\n2 \u03a000 = 0\nk\u22a5\n\n2\nk02 \u2212 k\u22a5\n\u2212 \u03a033 = 0\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n\fLet us find the solutions of Eqs.

Using the results (14) and (15) in the dispersion equations (9), (10), and taking into account\nthat the photon velocity for each propagation mode can be obtained from v(k) = \u2202k0 /\u2202 |k| 1 , we find that within\nthe considered approximation the transverse and longitudinal modes propagate perpendicularly to the compactified\ndirection with velocities\nT\nv\u22a5\n\u22431\u2212\n\ne2\nln \u03be,\n12\u03c0 2\n\n\u0003\n\u0002 L 2\nL\n2\n,\nv\u22a5\n\u2243 1 \u2212 (M\u22a5\n) /2k\u22a5\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nL 2\nrespectively, where (M\u22a5\n) = \u03a033 = e2 /3a2 > 0 plays the role of an effective topological mass for the longitudinal\nmode.\nT\nL\nIt is worth to mention that he modifications found for the two velocities, v\u22a5\nand v\u22a5\n, have different origins. The\nL\nL\nmodification of the longitudinal velocity v\u22a5 is due to the appearance of the topological mass M\u22a5\n; while the transverse\nT\nT\nsuperluminal velocity v\u22a5 (note that v\u22a5 > c because \u03be < 1 in the used approximation) appears as a consequence of a\ngenuine variation of the refraction index in the considered space-time.\nModifications of the photon speed in non-trivial vacua have been previously reported in the literature (for a review\nsee Refs. [11], and [12]). For example, in the case of the Casimir vacuum [13], [14] a superluminal light velocity was\nfound, while in the thermal vacuum an infraluminal velocity was obtained [12], [14], [15]. We stress that in both cases\nthe modifications appear as two-loop effects. In the S 1 \u00d7 R3 domain, however, the modifications that we are obtaining\nare one-loop correction and therefore more significant. It is easy to corroborate that for compactification lengths in\nagreement with the used approximation, a < 1/m \u223c 103 f m, the transverse velocity (16) is about 0.1% larger than\nthe light velocity in trivial space-time.\nT\nWe would like to address a point of possible concern. It has to do with the fact that albeit v\u22a5\n> c, there is no\ncausality violation here. To understand this, let us recall that the velocity (16) is a low-frequency mode velocity.\n\n1\nIn the considered low-frequency approximation the group and phase velocities coincide and can be found by the same proposed\nformula.\n\n3\n\n\fOn the other hand, the velocity of interest for signal propagation, and hence the relevant one for causality violation\nT\nproblems, is the high-frequency velocity v\u22a5\n(q0 \u2192 \u221e). To determine the difference between the two, it would be\nneeded to investigate the absorption coefficient Im n(q0 ), with n(q0 ) being the refraction index as a function of the\nfrequency in the space with S 1 \u00d7 R3 topology. However, beyond any needed calculation, we agree with the analysis\nof Refs. [16] about the lack of causality violations in similar systems. We believe that in the case under study no\n(micro-)causality should be violated, because the events taking place in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 space are not constrained by the\nnull cone of a Minkowskian system, as Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken in the present situation.\nL\nThe low-frequency limit ( k0 = 0, |k| \u2192 0) used to obtain the longitudinal-mode mass M\u22a5\nis essential to study\nthe static properties of the electromagnetic field in this space. The mass obtained in this limit plays the role of a\nmagnetic mass of the longitudinal electromagnetic mode [17]. Below, we show how this topological mass affects the\nmagnetic response of the system.\nIn linear response theory, the Maxwell equation of the longitudinal mode propagating perpendicularly to the OZdirection, taken in the Lorentz gauge \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0, is\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u22122\n(18)\n\u03b43\u03bc \u03b43\u03bd A\u03bd = eJ\u03bc ,\n\u2737\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (\u03bbL\n\u22a5)\nL\nL\nwhere the magnetic length \u03bbL\n\u22a5 is given, as usual, by \u03bb\u22a5 = 1/M\u22a5 . Considering an external static and constant current\nflowing inside the confined space along the OZ-axis, eJ3 (x) = I \u03b4 2 (x\u22a5 ), the induced potential, which is solution of\nEq. (18) with periodic boundary conditions in the OZ-direction, is\n\nA3 (x\u22a5 ) = \u2212\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nI\nK0 |x\u22a5 | /\u03bbL\n\u22a5\n2\u03c0\n\n(19)\n\nwhere K0 denotes a modified Bessel function of the third kind. In the |x\u22a5 | \u226b \u03bbL\n\u22a5 limit the corresponding magnetic\nfield is\n\u0001\nI exp \u2212r/\u03bbL\n\u22a5 b\nq\nB(r) = \u221a\n\u03b8\n(20)\n2 2\u03c0\nr\u03bbL\n\u22a5\nwith r = |x\u22a5 | and \u03b8b denoting the azimuth-angle unit vector of the cylindrical coordinates taken with z along the\nOZ-axis. From (20) we see that an azimuthal magnetic field will be screened along the radial direction, in a distance\nL\nequal to the inverse of the topological mass M\u22a5\n. The smaller the compactification length a, the larger the screening\nin the transverse direction.\nLet us turn our attention now to photons propagating along the OZ-direction (k\u22a5 = 0). In this case the dispersion\nrelations (7) and (8) can be written respectively as\nk02 \u2212 k32 \u2212 \u03a011 = 0\nk02 \u2212 k32 \u2212\n\nk02 \u2212 k32\n\u03a033 = 0\nk02\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nAssuming ak0 \u226a am \u226a 1 in (13), the components of the polarization operator appearing in (21) and (22) become\n\u0015\n\u0014\ne2 1\n+ O(\u03be 2 ) + O(k02 )\n(23)\n\u03a011 (k\u22a5 = 0, k3 , k0 \u223c 0) \u2243 2\na 9\n\n\u03a033 (k\u22a5 = 0, k3 , k0 \u223c 0) \u2243\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\ne2 k02 \u22121\n2\n+\nO(\u03be\n)\n+ O(k04 )\na2 k32 9\n\n(24)\n\nFrom (21), (22), (23) and (24) we can straightforwardly find the low-frequency limit of the photon velocities for\ntransverse and longitudinal modes propagating along the OZ-direction\ni\nh\n(25)\nvkT \u2243 1 \u2212 (MkT )2 /2k32 ,\ni\nh\nvkL \u2243 1 \u2212 (MkL )2 /2k32 ,\n4\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhere both transverse and longitudinal mode masses coincide and are given by MkT = MkL = e/3a. We stress that in\nthis case both velocities are smaller than the light velocity in trivial Minkowski space c, and that the modification is\ndue, as in (17), to the appearance of a topological photon mass for each mode.\nOne can investigate, as above, the implications of the masses MkT and MkL for the magnetic response of the system.\nA mass for a mode propagating along OZ yields a magnetic screening in that direction. However, since the effective\npenetration lengths are \u03bbTk = \u03bbL\nk = 3a/e > a, the corresponding magnetic fields would decay in a distance larger than\nthe compactification length, meaning that the screening effect is unobservable.\nIn summary, we have shown in this paper that in the S 1 \u00d7 R3 space-time the photon propagates through transverse\nand longitudinal modes. In addition, each mode moves anisotropically along the two identified spatial directions\n(parallel and perpendicular to OZ). This effect can be interpreted as a topological birefringence. Only the transverse\nmode moving perpendicularly to the compactified direction, remains massless. It propagates with a superluminal group\nvelocity that increases logarithmically with the compactification radius a. The remaining modes acquire topological\nL\nmasses inversely depending on a. As a consequence, at low energies (E < Mi , Mi = {M\u22a5\n, MkL , MkT }) the massive\nT\nphotons decouple and only the transverse mode propagating with velocity v\u22a5 will be active. This implies that at\nlow energies the topological mass generation acts as a natural confining mechanism that prevents photon propagation\nalong the compactified direction. Therefore, even though the original S 1 \u00d7R3 space-time is a four-dimensional domain,\nit reduces at low energies to an effective (2+1)\u2212dimensional manifold for the fields A\u03bc . These results can be of interest\nfor extra-dimension and brane theories, where it is necessary to confine at low energies the gauge fields to the branes.\nAnother important result is the existence of a topologically induced directional superconductivity, with Meissner\neffect taking place for magnetic fields contained in the transverse (2 + 1)\u2212dimensional space. This result could find\napplications in high-TC superconductivity where, as it is well known, the system is confined to a quasi-two-dimensional\nspace.\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure for two of the authors (EJF and VI) to express their gratitude to the Institute for Spatial Studies\nof Catalonia for the warm hospitality extended to them during the time this work was completed, and in particular\nto Dr. E.
