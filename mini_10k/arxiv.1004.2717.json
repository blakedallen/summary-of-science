INTRODUCTION\n\nMany of the most well-known logics in program verification, concurrency, and other\nareas of computer science and artificial intelligence can be cast as modal fixpoint\nlogics, that is, embedded into some variant of the \u03bc-calculus. Typical examples are\nPDL [Pratt 1976] where, say, the formula ha\u2217 ip ('p can be reached by finite iteration of\na') can be expressed as the least fixpoint\n\u03bcX. p \u2228 haiX;\nCTL [Emerson and Clarke 1982], whose formula AF p ('p eventually holds on all paths')\nis just the fixpoint\n\u03bcX. p \u2228 2X;\nand the common knowledge operator C of epistemic logic [Lewis 1969], where Cp ('it\nis common knowledge that p') can be expressed as the fixpoint\nn\n^\nKi (p \u2227 X)\n\u03bdX.\ni=1\n\nwith n the number of agents and Ki read as 'agent i knows that'. A common feature\nof these examples is that they trade off expressivity for simplicity of expression in\ncomparison to the full \u03bc-calculus.\nOne of the reasons why the full \u03bc-calculus is hard for both end users and logicians is that it requires keeping track of bound variables. Indeed we note that the\nsimpler logics listed above (in the case of PDL, the \u2217-nesting-free fragment) live in\nthe single-variable fragment of the \u03bc-calculus (a subfragment of the alternation-free\nfragment [Emerson and Lei 1986]), which is precisely what enables one to abandon\nvariables altogether in favour of variable-free fixpoint operators such as AF or C.\nWe refer to logics that embed into a single-variable \u03bc-calculus as flat fixpoint logics [Santocanale and Venema 2010].\nHere, we study flat fixpoint logics in the more general setting of coalgebraic logic. Coalgebra has emerged as the right level of generality for a unified treatment of a wide range of modalities with seemingly disparate semantics beyond the realm of pure relational structures. Examples include monotone modalities [Chellas 1980], probabilistic modalities [Larsen and Skou 1991],\n\n\fgraded modalities [Fine 1972; D'Agostino and Visser 2002], coalitional/alternatingtime modalities [Alur et al. 2002; Pauly 2002], and various non-monotonic conditionals [Friedman and Halpern 1994; Olivetti et al. 2007]. The semantics of coalgebraic\nlogic is parametrized over the choice of an endofunctor on the category of sets,\nwhose coalgebras play the role of frames. Besides standard Kripke frames, the notion of coalgebra encompasses, e.g., Markov chains, weighted automata, multigraphs,\nneighbourhood frames, selection function frames [Chellas 1980], and concurrent game\nstructures [Alur et al. 2002]. Generic completeness results in coalgebraic logic are\nparametrized over sets of rules or axioms that satisfy a local form of completeness\ncalled one-step completeness. That is, they require completeness of a restricted logic\nwithout fixpoints and nesting of modalities that is interpreted over mere elements\nof the functor rather than full-blown frames or models (e.g. in the relational base\ncase, over a single subset of the base set thought of as a local view on a set of successors), a condition that is typically quite easy to establish. In fact, suitable one-step\ncomplete axiomatizations for many examples can already be found in the literature\non coalgebraic logic [Pattinson 2003; Schr\u00f6der 2007; Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009;\nKupke and Pattinson 2010].\nIn our flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics one thus can express statements such as 'the\ncoalition C of agents can maintain p forever', 'the present state is the root of a binary\ntree all whose leaves satisfy p', or 'p is commonly believed with reasonable certainty'.\nIn particular, we cover flat fragments of the graded \u03bc-calculus [Kupferman et al. 2002]\nand the alternating-time \u03bc-calculus (AMC) [Alur et al. 2002]; one such flat fragment is\nalternating-time temporal logic (ATL).\nOur main result on flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics is completeness of the natural axiomatization that makes the fixpoint definitions explicit, generalizing the wellknown Kozen-Park axiomatization. The axiomatization is parametric both w.r.t. the\ncoalgebraic branching type and the choice of flat fragment, under mild restrictions\non the form of fixpoint operators. This result generalizes results by Santocanale\nand Venema [2010] to the level of coalgebraic logic, and relies on the notion of Oadjointness [Santocanale 2008] to prove that fixpoints in the Lindenbaum algebra are\nconstructive, i.e. approximable in \u03c9 steps. The crucial ingredient here are one-step cutfree complete rule sets [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009; Pattinson and Schr\u00f6der 2010].\nThese enable generalizations of both the key rigidity lemma and the O-adjointness\ntheorem of [Santocanale and Venema 2010], the latter to the effect that all uniformdepth modal operators are O-adjoint.\nOur completeness result follows a long tradition of non-trivial completeness proofs for fixpoint logics, e.g. PDL [Kozen and Parikh 1981;\nSegerberg 1982], CTL [Emerson and Halpern 1985], LTL [Gabbay et al. 1980;\nLichtenstein and Pnueli 2000], the aconjunctive \u03bc-calculus [Kozen 1983], and the\nfull \u03bc-calculus [Walukiewicz 2000]. Note that all these results are independent,\nas completeness is not in general inherited by sublogics, and in fact employ quite\ndifferent methods. Instantiating our generic results to concrete logics yields new\nresults in nearly all cases that go beyond the classical relational \u03bc-calculus, noting\nthat neither Kupferman et al. [2002] nor Cirstea et al. [2011] cover axiomatizations.\nIn particular, we obtain for the first time a completeness result for graded fixpoint\nlogics, i.e. fragments of the graded \u03bc-calculus, and we generalize the completeness of\nATL [Goranko and van Drimmelen 2006] to arbitrary flat fragments of the AMC.\nFurther Related Work. The present paper is an extended and revised version of a\nprevious conference paper [Schr\u00f6der and Venema 2010]. The technical treatment differs from the conference version in that we weaken the assumptions of the generic\ncompleteness theorem to require only a one-step complete rule set instead of a one2\n\n\fstep cutfree complete one; moreover, we opt for a propositional basis with unrestricted negation, converting to negation normal form only for purposes of the model\nconstruction in Section 5. Flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics are fragments of coalgebraic \u03bc-calculi, and as such known to be decidable in E XP T IME under reasonable\nassumptions [C\u0131\u0302rstea et al. 2011]. A tableau-based global caching algorithm for flat\nfixpoint logics has recently been developed by Hausmann and one of the authors\n(Schr\u00f6der) [2015], so we omit discussion of the (less practical) tableau algorithm given\nin the conference version.\nOrganization. We recall the requisite background in coalgebraic logic and introduce\nthe syntax of semantics of flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics in Section 2. We proceed to\ndiscuss the generic axiomatization in Section 3. In Section 4, we prove the central Oadjointness theorem, and then present the ensuing model construction in Section 5.\nSection 6 concludes.\n2. FLAT COALGEBRAIC FIXPOINT LOGICS\n\nWe briefly recall the generic framework of coalgebraic modal logic [Pattinson 2004;\nSchr\u00f6der 2007], and define its extension with flat fixpoint operators, a fragment of\nthe coalgebraic \u03bc-calculus [C\u0131\u0302rstea et al. 2011]. We present the calculus in a form that\nincludes negation, and therefore need to pay attention to positive and negative occurrences of variables and subformulas; to avoid excessive repetition, we fix these notions\nfor all notions of formula that include negation and possibly a notion of (propositional)\nvariable:\nDefinition 2.1. In any logic with negation \u00ac, an occurrence of a subformula in a\nformula is positive if it is in the scope of an even number of negations \u00ac, and otherwise\nnegative. In logics featuring a notion of (propositional) variable, a formula \u03c6 is positive\n(negative) in a variable x if all occurrences of x in \u03c6 are positive (negative).\nFor the rest of the paper, we fix a countably infinite set V of variables, with a single\ndistinguished recursion variable that is always called x; all other variables are parameter variables, typically called p or p1 , p2 , . . . . The first parameter of the syntax of a flat\ncoalgebraic fixpoint logic is a (modal) similarity type \u039b, i.e. an at most countable set of\nmodal operators with associated finite arities. The set of modal fixpoint schemes \u03b3, \u03b4 is\ngiven by the grammar\n\u03b3, \u03b4 ::= \u22a5 | v | \u00ac\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2227 \u03b4 | \u2665(\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n )\nwhere \u2665 \u2208 \u039b is n-ary and v \u2208 V ; we require additionally that fixpoint schemes are\npositive in all variables (this is essential in case of the recursion variable x to ensure\nexistence of fixpoints; for parameter variables, it is a mere technical convenience, as\nnegative occurrences of a parameter variable can be replaced with positive occurrences\nof a fresh variable, with negation moved into the parameter formula). Further Boolean\noperations \u22a4, \u2228, \u2192, \u2194 are defined as usual. Moreover, we abbreviate\n\u2665(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) = \u00ac\u2665(\u00ac\u03c61 , . . . , \u00ac\u03c6n )\nfor \u2665 \u2208 \u039b, and refer to \u2665 as the dual of \u2665. We intend variables as place holders for\narguments and parameters of formulas defining fixpoint operators; as such, they serve\nonly technical purposes and will not form part of the actual fixpoint language defined\nbelow (other than as part of modal fixpoint schemes indexing flat fixpoint operators).\nIn particular, propositional variables should not be confused with propositional atoms,\nwhich can appear also in actual formulas. Propositional atoms are incorporated into\nthe modal similarity type \u039b as nullary operators when needed; this approach not only\n3\n\n\fsimplifies the technical presentation but it also enhances generality in that it allows\ncovering logics that do not have propositional atoms, such as Hennessy-Milner logic.\nThe second syntactic parameter is a set \u0393 of modal fixpoint schemes \u03b3 determining the choice of fixpoint operators. We require that all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 are guarded, i.e. that\nall occurrences of the recursion variable x are under the scope of at least one modal\noperator; this is not an essential restriction as every \u03bc-calculus formula is provably\nequivalent to a guarded formula [Walukiewicz 2000]. We denote substituted formulas \u03b3[\u03c61 /p1 ; . . . ; \u03c6n /pn ; \u03c8/x] as \u03b3(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n , \u03c8). The set F\u266f (\u039b, \u0393) or just F\u266f of (fixpoint)\nformulas \u03c6, \u03c8 is then defined by the grammar\n\u03c6, \u03c8 ::= \u22a5 | \u00ac\u03c6 | \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 | \u2665(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) | \u266f\u03b3 (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n )\nwhere \u2665 \u2208 \u039b is n-ary and \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393. The operator \u266f\u03b3 takes least fixpoints\n\u266f\u03b3 (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) = \u03bcx.\u03b3(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n , x).\nThe name flat for the fixpoint operators \u266f\u03b3 relates to the fact that modal fixpoint\nschemes \u03b3 do not contain fixpoint operators. Note however that nesting of flat fixpoint\noperators is unrestricted, i.e. the \u03c6i can be arbitrary fixpoint formulas in \u266f\u03b3 (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ).\nWe introduce greatest fixpoint operators as duals of least fixpoint operators: for a\nmodal fixpoint scheme \u03b3 we denote by \u03b3 its dual, i.e. the modal fixpoint scheme \u00ac\u03b3\u03c3\nwhere \u03c3(v) = \u00acv for all variables v. We then define the greatest fixpoint operator \u266d\u03b3 by\n\u266d\u03b3 (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) = \u00ac\u266f\u03b3 (\u00ac\u03c61 , . . . , \u00ac\u03c6n )\nso that \u266d\u03b3 (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) = \u03bdx. \u03b3(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n , x).\nA standard example of a flat fixpoint logic is CTL, whose operators AU, EG can be\ncoded as\nA[\u03c6 U \u03c8] = \u266f(p2 \u2228(p1 \u22272x)) (\u03c6, \u03c8)\n\nand EG \u03c6 = \u266dp\u22273x \u03c6.\n\nNote here that p \u2227 3x is equivalent to the dual \u00ac(\u00acp \u2228 2\u00acx) of p \u2228 2x.\nSyntactically, \u266f\u03b3 is regarded as an atomic operator; in particular, occurrences of variables in \u03b3 do not count as occurrences in formulas \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6. For the sake of readability,\nwe restrict the further technical development to unary modalities \u2665 \u2208 \u039b and unary\nfixpoint operators, i.e. we assume that every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 has only one parameter variable,\ndenoted by p throughout; the extension to higher arities is a mere notational issue, and\nin fact we continue to use higher-arity modalities and fixpoint operators in the examples. Note that we have not included variables in the definition of fixpoint formulas. A\n(fixpoint) formula with variables is an expression of the form \u03b3\u03c3, where \u03b3 is a modal\nfixpoint scheme and \u03c3 is a substitution of some of the variables in \u03b3 with fixpoint formulas (i.e. variables never appear under fixpoint operators). In the following, the term\nformula will refer to fixpoint formulas without variables unless variables are explicitly mentioned. We sometimes indicate the occurrence of a variable v in a formula \u03c8 by\nwriting \u03c8(v), and then write \u03c8(\u03c1) for the formula obtained by substituting a formula \u03c1\nfor v. For a modal fixpoint scheme \u03b3(p, x), we denote the function taking a formula \u03c8\nto \u03b3(\u03c6, \u03c8) by \u03b3(\u03c6), and by \u03b3(\u03c6)k its k-fold iteration.\nThe logic is further parametrized semantically over the underlying class of systems\nand the interpretation of the modal operators. The former is determined by the choice\nof a functor\nT : Set \u2192 Set,\ni.e. an operation T that maps sets X to sets T X and functions f : X \u2192 Y to functions\nT f : T X \u2192 T Y , preserving identities and composition. The role of models is then\nplayed by T -coalgebras, i.e. pairs (X, \u03be) where X is a set of states and\n\u03be : X \u2192 TX\n4\n\n\fis the structure map. Thinking of T X informally as a parametrized datatype over X,\nwe regard \u03be as associating with each state x a structured collection \u03be(x) of successor\nstates and observations. E.g. for T X = PX \u00d7 PU , with U a fixed set of propositional\natoms and P denoting the covariant powerset functor (with Pf (A) = f [A] for f : X \u2192 Y\nand A \u2208 P(X)), we obtain that T -coalgebras are Kripke models, as they associate with\neach state a set of successor states and a set of valid propositional atoms. Our main\ninterest here is in examples beyond Kripke semantics, see Example 2.3.\nGiven T , the interpretation of the modalities is determined by associating with each\n\u2665 \u2208 \u039b a predicate lifting [[\u2665]] for T . Here, a predicate lifting (for T ) is a family of maps\n\u03bbX : PX \u2192 PT X, where X ranges over all sets, satisfying the naturality condition\n\u03bbX (f \u22121 [A]) = (T f )\u22121 [\u03bbY (A)]\nfor all f : X \u2192 Y , A \u2208 PY . In other words, a predicate lifting is a natural transformation\n\u03bb : Q \u2192 Q \u25e6 T op\nwhere Q : Setop \u2192 Set denotes the contravariant powerset functor, given by QX being\nthe powerset of X and Qf (A) = f \u22121 [A] for f : X \u2192 Y and A \u2286 Y . The idea is that a\npredicate lifting \u03bbX converts a predicate on the set X of states into a predicate on the\nset T X of structured collections over X. The basic example, for T X = P(X) \u00d7 P(U ) as\nabove, is\n[[2]]X (A) = {(B, P ) | B \u2286 A},\nwhich induces precisely the usual semantics of the box when composed with taking\npreimages under the structure map, as in the clause for the semantics of modalities\ngiven below. Given a predicate lifting [[\u2665]], we also have a predicate lifting [[\u2665]] for the\ndual modality \u2665, given by\n[[\u2665]]X (A) = X \u2212 [[\u2665]]X (X \u2212 A).\nE.g. for 2 as above and 3 = 2, we have [[3]]X (A) = {(B, P ) | B \u2229 A 6= \u2205}.\nAs we work with fixpoints, we insist that all modal operators are monotone, i.e.\n[[\u2665]]X : P(X) \u2192 P(T X) is monotone w.r.t. set inclusion for each \u2665 \u2208 \u039b. The semantics\nof a formula \u03c6 with recursion variable x (no other variables will ever be evaluated in\nunsubstituted form) is a subset [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B) \u2286 X, depending on a T -coalgebra (X, \u03be) and\na set B \u2286 X serving as the interpretation of x. The semantics of formulas \u03c6 without\nvariables (in particular of \u266f-formulas) will not depend on B and hence will be denoted\njust by [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) ; we write x |=(X,\u03be) \u03c6 for x \u2208 [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) . The set [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B) is defined by\nrecursion over \u03c6:\n[[x]](X,\u03be) (B) = B\n[[\u00ac\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B) = X \\ [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B)\n[[\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8]](X,\u03be) (B) = [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B) \u2229 [[\u03c8]](X,\u03be) (B)\n[[\u2665\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B) = \u03be \u22121 [[\u2665]]X ([[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (B))\n\\\n[[\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6]](X,\u03be) = {B \u2286 X | [[\u03b3(\u03c6)]](X,\u03be) (B) \u2286 B}\nThe clause for \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 just says that [[\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6]](X,\u03be) is the least fixpoint of the map [[\u03b3(\u03c6)]](X,\u03be) :\nP(X) \u2192 P(X), which is monotone because all modalities are monotone and modal\nfixpoint schemes are positive in the recursion variable. We fix the data T , \u039b, \u0393 etc.\nthroughout.\n5\n\n\fWe recall that given T -coalgebras (X, \u03be) and (Y, \u03b6), a T -coalgebra morphism f :\n(X, \u03be) \u2192 (Y, \u03b6) is a map f : X \u2192 Y making the diagram\nX\n\nf\n\n\u03be\n\n\u000f\nTX\n\n/Y\n\u03b6\n\nTf\n\n\u000f\n/ TY\n\ncommute. Flat fixpoint formulas are invariant under coalgebra morphisms:\nL EMMA 2.2. Let f : (X, \u03be) \u2192 (Y, \u03b6) be a T -coalgebra morphism, let B \u2286 Y , and let\n\u03c6 be a flat fixpoint formula. Then\n[[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (f \u22121 [B]) = f \u22121 [[[\u03c6]](Y,\u03b6) (B)].\n\n(1)\n\n(The lemma holds more generally for the full coalgebraic \u03bc-calculus, with essentially\nthe same proof; we refrain from stating it in more generality here to avoid introducing\nadditional notation.)\nP ROOF. Induction over \u03c6; the Boolean cases are trivial, and the modal cases are by\nnaturality of predicate liftings (cf. [Pattinson 2004]). We are left with the fixpoint case;\nwe work with \u03bc-calculus notation, i.e. our remaining case is of the form \u03bcx. \u03c6, a closed\nformula because there is only one recursion variable. That is, we are to show that\n[[\u03bcx. \u03c6]](X,\u03be) = f \u22121 [[[\u03bcx. \u03c6]](Y,\u03b6) ].\n\n(2)\n\nIt is well-known that we can approximate least fixpoints of monotone functions\nfrom below using ordinal-indexed chains. Specifically, [[\u03bcx. \u03c6]](X,\u03be) is the union of the\n0\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1+1\n\nsets [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205) indexed over ordinals \u03b1, defined by [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205) = \u2205, by [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205) =\nS\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n[[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) ([[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205)) in the successor step, and by [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205) = \u03b2<\u03b1 [[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205) in the\n\u03b1\nlimit step; analogously, [[\u03bcx. \u03c6]](Y,\u03b6) is approximated from below by sets [[\u03c6]](Y,\u03b6) (\u2205). Since\ntaking preimages under f commutes with [[\u03c6]] by the inductive hypothesis, and generally commutes with (infinite) unions and preserves \u2205, an easy transfinite induction\nshows that\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n[[\u03c6]](X,\u03be) (\u2205) = f \u22121 [[[\u03c6]](Y,\u03b6) (\u2205)]\nfor all \u03b1. The inductive claim follows by forming the union over all \u03b1 on both sides,\nagain using commutation of preimages with unions.\nExample 2.3. We discuss select examples covered by the coalgebraic approach, starting with a more detailed exposition of the basic example of\nKripke semantics and then moving on beyond. More examples are found, e.g.,\nin [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009; Pattinson and Schr\u00f6der 2010]. For the sake of readability, we elide the treatment of propositional atoms in all examples except Kripke\nsemantics, as the technicalities are the same in all cases.\n(1) Kripke semantics: In mild generalization of the basic example discussed above,\nfixpoint extensions of the modal logics Km have modal operators 2i for i = 1, . . . , m,\ninterpreted over the functor T given on sets by T X = (PX)m \u00d7 PU using the predicate\nliftings J2i KX (A) = {(B1 , . . . , Bm , P ) \u2208 (PX)m \u00d7 PU | Bi \u2286 A}. Coalgebras for T\nare in 1-1 correspondence with m-relation Kripke models, and [[2i ]] captures the usual\nsemantics of the box operators. Atomic propositions are modelled as nullary modalities\na \u2208 \u039b, interpreted by nullary predicate liftings\n[[a]]X = {(B1 , . . . , Bm , P ) \u2208 (PX)m \u00d7 PU | a \u2208 P }.\n6\n\n\fCTL, \u2217-nesting-free PDL, and the logic of common knowledge all are flat fixpoint logics\nin this setting. The CTL operators have been exemplified above; the operator [a\u2217 ] of\nPDL is the greatest fixpoint operator\n[a\u2217 ] = \u266dp\u2227[a]x ;\nand the common knowledge operator C is the greatest fixpoint operator \u266d\u03b3 for\n\u03b3 =p\u2227\n\nm\n^\n\n2i x.\n\ni=1\n\nAlthough our main result does not support completely arbitrary fixpoint operators,\nit does (like already [Santocanale and Venema 2010]) cover operators that go beyond\nCTL. E.g. the operator 'on every path, every even state satisfies . . . ', which is not expressible in CTL [Emerson 1990; Wolper 1983], is the greatest fixpoint operator\n\u266dp\u222722x .\nStrictly speaking one should note that so far, we have not covered CTL in the standard\nsense, according to which models are assumed to be serial, i.e. every state is required\nto have at least one successor. We model this requirement coalgebraically by replacing\nT as above with the functor T \u2032 X = P \u2217 X \u00d7 PU where P \u2217 is the non-empty powerset\nfunctor P \u2217 , i.e. P \u2217 X is the set of non-empty subsets of X. (Since CTL standardly uses\nonly one next-step modality AX, we omit the exponent m.) We distinguish the arising\nfixpoint logics by the adjective serial, and refer to absence of the seriality requirement\nby the adjective non-serial.\nFurther restricting the semantics to require that every state has exactly one successor\nin fact produces the usual discrete-linear-order semantics of LTL (where 2 is typically\ndenoted #). Coalgebraically, this is reflected in using the functor T \u2032\u2032 X = X \u00d7 PU ; we\nrefer to T \u2032\u2032 -coalgebras as deterministic Kripke models. (For purposes of model checking, LTL is more generally interpreted over labelled transition systems, but the more\nrestrictive discrete-linear-order semantics is equivalent for purposes of satisfiability.)\n(2) Graded\nfixpoint\nlogics\nare\nsublogics\nof\nthe\ngraded\n\u03bccalculus [Kupferman et al. 2002]. They have modal operators 3k 'in more than k\nsuccessors', with duals \u0003k = 3k 'in all but k successors'. We interpret them over the\nfunctor B that takes a set X to the set\nBX = X \u2192 N \u222a {\u221e}\nof multisets over X (with possibly infinite multiplicities) by\n[[3k ]]X (A) = {\u03bc \u2208 BX | \u03bc(A) > k}\nwhere\nwe use \u03bc \u2208 BX as an N \u222a {\u221e}-valued measure, i.e. write \u03bc(A) =\nP\n\u03bc(x).\nThis captures the semantics of graded modalities over multix\u2208A\ngraphs [D'Agostino and Visser 2002], which is equivalent to the more customary\nKripke semantics [Fine 1972] w.r.t. satisfiability of fixpoint formulas (Lemma 2.4).\nIn description logic, graded operators are called qualified number restrictions [Baader et al. 2003]. The example mentioned in [Kupferman et al. 2002], a\ngraded fixpoint formula expressing that the current state is the root of a finite binary\ntree all whose leaves satisfy p, can be expressed by the \u266f-operator for\np \u2228 31 x.\nSimilarly, the \u266f-operator for\np \u2228 \u0003k x\n7\n\n\fexpresses that p holds somewhere on every infinite k+1-ary tree starting at the current\nstate. To add an example where the recursion variable x appears under more than one\nmodality, the \u266f-operator for\np \u2228 31 31 x\nexpresses that the current state is the root of a finite binary tree all whose leaves are\nat even distance from the root and satisfy p.\n(3) Probabilistic fixpoint logics, i.e. fixpoint extensions of probabilistic modal\nlogic [Larsen and Skou 1991; Fagin and Halpern 1994; Heifetz and Mongin 2001],\nhave modal operators Lr 'in the next step, it holds with probability at least r that',\nfor r \u2208 [0, 1] \u2229 Q. They are interpreted over the functor D that maps a set X to the set\nof discrete probability distributions on X by putting\n[[Lr ]]X (A) = {P \u2208 DX | P A \u2265 r}.\nCoalgebras for D are Markov chains. Flat probabilistic fixpoint logics in this\nsense are fragments of the probabilistic \u03bc-calculus in the sense introduced by\nC\u0131\u0302rstea et al. [2011] (to be distinguished from the [0, 1]-valued logic of the same\nname [Morgan and McIver 1997; Huth and Kwiatkowska 1997]) as an instance of the\ncoalgebraic \u03bc-calculus. The probabilistic \u03bc-calculus was subsequently reinvented by\nLiu et al. [2015] (Liu et al. prove that model checking the probabilistic \u03bc-calculus is\nin UP\u2229CO UP and satisfiability is in 2E XP T IME while C\u0131\u0302rstea et al. already show that\nsatisfiability is E XP T IME-complete). More generally, one can admit linear inequalities\nbetween probabilities, as, e.g., in work by Fagin and Halpern [1994], as long as one\npays attention to monotonicity; this allows, e.g., for statements of the form 'more probably than not'.\nIn a view of probabilistic logic as a logic of reactive systems, we can use the \u266d-operator\nAGr = \u266dp\u2227Lr x\nto express formulas like AGr \u00acfail, stating that the system will, at any point during its\nrun time, fail with probability at most 1 \u2212 r; a sensible specification for systems that\nmay sometimes fail but should not fail excessively often (as announced, we silently\ninclude propositional atoms such as fail in the syntax).\nAlternatively, we may interpret the operators Lp epistemically. We extend the logic to\nmultiple agents in the same way as for K in Item 1, obtaining a logic with probabilistic\noperators Lir read 'agent i believes with confidence r that'. We then have an uncertain\nvariant Cr of the common knowledge operator, namely the \u266d-operator for\nVm i\ni=1 Lr (p \u2227 x).\n\nThus, Cr \u03c6 is read 'everyone believes with confidence r that \u03c6 holds and that everyone\nbelieves with confidence r that \u03c6 holds etc.', in short '\u03c6 is commonly believed with\nconfidence r'.\nA variant is the operator Cr,q which, when applied to a formula \u03c6, separates belief in \u03c6\nfrom beliefs about other agents: Cr,q is the \u266d-operator for\nVn\ni\ni\ni=1 (Lr p \u2227 Lq x),\n\nand thus Cr,q \u03c6 states that everyone believes \u03c6 with confidence r, and believes with\nconfidence q that all agents believe the same, etc. (Note that Cr,r is not the same as Cr !)\n(4) Conditional fixpoint logics have a single binary modal operator \u21d2, written\nin infix notation. The intended reading of a \u21d2 b is 'if a, then normally b'. Conditional logics come with a wide variety of axiomatizations and semantics (see,\ne.g., [Pattinson and Schr\u00f6der 2010] for an overview). E.g., the minimal conditional\nlogic CK is interpreted over the functor Cf that maps a set X to the set PX \u2192 PX\n8\n\n\f(more precisely QX \u2192 PX, where Q is contravariant powerset), whose coalgebras are\nselection function models [Chellas 1980], by putting\n[[\u21d2]]X (A, B) = {f \u2208 Cf X | f (A) \u2286 B}.\n(Thus, \u21d2 is monotone in the second but not antimonotone in the first argument, which\nis precisely the point of inventing it. Technically, this is fine as long as we form fixpoints\nonly over the second argument, i.e. let the recursion variable x appear in \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 only to\nthe right of \u21d2 as in the example below.)\nWe\ncan\ncombine\ncoalgebraic\nlogics\nfreely\nusing\nresults\nof [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2007]. E.g., combining conditional logic with multi-agent K\nin its description logic incarnation ALC [Baader et al. 2003], we can define an abstract\nconcept of animal taxa with two-gender descendancy as \u266d\u03b3 (FirstOfItsKind, Male, Female)\nwith \u03b3 given as\n(\u00acp1 ) \u21d2 ((\u2203 hasParent. p2 \u2293 x) \u2293 (\u2203 hasParent. p3 \u2293 x)).\nA taxon is a fixpoint of \u03b3(FirstOfItsKind, Male, Female) if all individuals that do not belong\nto some assumed first ancestor generation of the species normally have two parents of\nthe same species, and the greatest fixpoint subsumes all animals belonging to such\ntaxa. The use of the conditional \u21d2 instead of standard material implication \u2192 takes\ninto account that these days, a given exceptional sheep might, e.g., be a clone and thus\nnot have parents in the strict sense.\n(5) The alternating-time \u03bc-calculus (AMC) [Alur et al. 2002] has modal operators\nhhCii read 'coalition C of agents can enforce . . . in one step', where a coalition C is a\nsubset C \u2286 N of a fixed set N = {1, . . . , n} of agents; we shall also write [C] in place\nof hhCii as in coalition logic [Pauly 2002]. The semantics of the coalitional modalities is defined over concurrent game structures (or game frames), and can be captured\ncoalgebraically [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009]: We define a functor G by\n\u0001\nQ\nGX = {(f, (ki )i\u2208N ) | f :\ni\u2208N [ki ] \u2192 X}\n\nwhere ki \u2208 N and [ki ] = {1, . . . , ki }, and by Gg(f, (ki )i\u2208N ) = (g \u25e6 f, (ki )i\u2208N ) for g : X \u2192 Y .\nThis captures a form of concurrent game where each agent i \u2208 N chooses a move\nji \u2208 [ki ] and the joint choice determines an outcome f (j1 , . . . , jn ) \u2208 X. (The semantics\ngiven by Pauly [2002] differs slightly in that the agents can have unrestricted sets of\navailable moves rather than only finite ones.) Coalgebras (X, \u03be) for G are concurrent\ngame structures [Alur et al. 2002]; they associate to each state x \u2208 X a concurrent\ngame \u03be(x) \u2208 GX whose outcomes are states, and thus allow for plays with multiple\nsuccessive moves. The semantics of the modalities [C] is given by the liftings\nJ[C]KX (A) = {(f, (ki )i\u2208N ) \u2208 GX | \u2203(ji \u2208 [ki ])i\u2208C . \u2200(ji \u2208 [ki ])i\u2208N \\C . f ((ji )i\u2208N ) \u2208 A}.\nThat is, a state x in a concurrent game structure satisfies [C]\u03c6 if the agents in C have\na joint choice of moves such that regardless of the choice of moves by the other agents,\nthe outcome satisfies \u03c6.\nOne of the flat fragments of the AMC is Alternating-Time Temporal Logic\n(ATL) [Alur et al. 2002]. E.g., the ATL-operator hhCiip1 U p2 , read 'coalition C can eventually force p2 and meanwhile maintain p1 ', is the \u266f-operator for\np2 \u2228 (p1 \u2227 [C]x).\nAs already in the case of CTL, flat fixpoints in the AMC go considerably beyond ATL;\ne.g. the \u266d-operator for p \u2227 [\u2205][\u2205]x ('p holds in all even states along any path') is not even\nin the more expressive logic ATL\u2217 [Alur et al. 2002; Dam 1994]. A similar flat operator,\nthe \u266d-operator for [C](p \u2227 [D](q \u2227 x)), expresses that coalitions C and D can forever play\nping-pong between p and q.\n9\n\n\f(6) Monotone fixpoint logics have a modal operator 2, interpreted over the monotone\nneighbourhood functor defined by\nMX = {A \u2208 P(PX) | A upwards closed}\nby means of the predicate lifting\n[[2]]X (A) = {A \u2208 MX | A \u2208 A}.\n(The functor M acts on maps f : X \u2192 Y by Mf (A) = {B \u2208 PY | f \u22121 [B] \u2208 A}, and\nhence is a subfunctor of the double contravariant powerset functor.) Often, the axioms\n2\u22a4 and 3\u22a4 are imposed where 3 = 2 denotes the dual of 2. This amounts to using\nthe subfunctor Ms of M given by\nMs X = {A \u2208 MX | \u2205 \u2208\n/ A \u220b X},\nthe serial monotone neighbourhood functor, whose coalgebras are serial monotone\nneighbourhood frames. In particular, these form the semantic setting of concurrent\nPDL [Peleg 1987] and Parikh's game logic [Parikh 1985], where additionally operators are indexed over atomic programs or games, respectively; this is modelled coalgebraically in the same way as multi-modal K (Item 1). The \u2217-nesting-free fragments of\nconcurrent PDL and game logic are flat fixpoint logics. E.g., game logic has operators\nh\u03b3i, indexed over composite games \u03b3 and read 'Angel has a strategy to enforce . . . in\ngame \u03b3'. Games are formed from atomic games using the usual constructs for regular\nexpressions as in PDL, and additionally the dualizing operator (\u2212)d which swaps the\nroles of the players in a game. E.g. one has a demonic iteration operator (\u2212)\u00d7 defined\nby \u03b3 \u00d7 = ((\u03b3 d )\u2217 )d . The formula h\u03b3 \u00d7 i\u03c6 thus says that Angel has a strategy to enforce \u03c6 in\nthe game where \u03b3 is played repeatedly, with Demon choosing the number of rounds. If\n\u03b3 is star-free (i.e. contains neither (\u2212)\u2217 nor (\u2212)\u00d7 ), we can phrase h\u03b3 \u00d7 i as the \u266d-operator\nfor p \u2227 h\u03b3ix.\nIt remains to show the mentioned equivalence of the Kripke semantics and the multigraph semantics of the graded \u03bc-calculus (Example 2.3.2), generalizing the equivalence for the fixpoint-free case [Schr\u00f6der 2007].\nL EMMA 2.4. A formula in the flat graded \u03bc-calculus is satisfiable over (finite)\nKripke frames iff it is satisfiable over (finite) multigraphs.\nP ROOF. For the sake of simplicity, we continue to elide propositional atoms. Since\nevery Kripke frame can be regarded as a multigraph, 'only if ' is clear. To show 'if ', let\n\u03c6 be a flat graded fixpoint formula, and let x0 be a state in a B-coalgebra (X, \u03be) such\nthat x0 |=(X,\u03be) \u03c6. Let k0 be maximal such that 3k0 occurs in \u03c6. Observe that \u03c6 remains\nsatisfied if we replace \u03be with \u03be \u2032 where \u03be \u2032 (x)(y) = min(\u03be(x)(y), k0 + 1) (formally, this is\nproved by induction on \u03c6), so we can assume that all \u03be(x)(y) are finite (in fact, at most\nk0 + 1). Now construct a Kripke model (X\u0304, R) by making sufficiently many copies of\nstates, as in [Schr\u00f6der 2007, Remark 6]: take as states in X\u0304 all pairs (y, j) \u2208 X \u00d7 N\nsuch that \u03be(x)(y) > j for some x, and in this case put (x, i)R(y, j) for all i such that\n(x, i) \u2208 X\u0304. Note that X\u0304 is finite if X is finite. Like for any Kripke frame, we can\n \u0304 i)(y, j) = 1 if (x, i)R(y, j),\nequivalently regard (X\u0304, R) as a multigraph (X\u0304, \u03be\u0304) where \u03be(x,\n \u0304 i)(y, j) = 0 otherwise. Let \u03c0 : X\u0304 \u2192 X denote the projection that maps (x, i) to\nand \u03be(x,\nx. By Lemma 2.2, it suffices to show that\n\u03c0 : (X\u0304, \u03be\u0304) \u2192 (X, \u03be)\nis a B-coalgebra morphism, i.e. that\n \u0304 i)) = \u03be(x).\nB\u03c0(\u03be(x,\n10\n\n\fIndeed the multiplicity of y \u2208 X in the multiset on the left hand side is the cardinality\nof the set {(y, j) \u2208 X\u0304 | (x, i)R(y, j)}, which equals \u03be(x)(y) by construction of R.\n3. THE GENERIC AXIOMATIZATION\n\nThe generic semantic and syntactic framework of the previous section comes with a\ngeneric, parametrized deduction system, whose completeness will be our main result.\nWe begin with the fixed part of the deduction system. We include full propositional\nreasoning, i.e. introduction of substituted propositional tautologies and modus ponens.\nFixpoints are governed by the obvious Kozen-Park axiomatization: we have the unfolding axiom\n\u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6) \u2192 \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6\nand the fixpoint induction rule\n\u03b3(\u03c6, \u03c7) \u2192 \u03c7\n,\n\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c7\nfor all formulas \u03c6, \u03c7; together, these axioms capture the fact that \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 is the least prefixpoint of \u03b3(\u03c6).\nL EMMA 3.1. The monotonicity and congruence rules\n\u03c6\u2192\u03c8\n\u03c6\u2194\u03c8\n\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2192 \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8\n\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2194 \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8\nare derivable.\nP ROOF. The congruence rule is derivable from the monotonicity rule. To derive the\nlatter, assume \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8. Since \u03b3 is positive in the parameter variable, we can then derive\n\u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8) \u2192 \u03b3(\u03c8, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8). By unfolding, we derive \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8) \u2192 \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8, and then \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2192 \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8 by\nfixpoint induction.\nThe variable part of the proof system is the axiomatization of the modal operators,\nwhich turns out to be completely orthogonal to the fixpoint axiomatization. In fact, we\ncan just reuse complete rule sets for the purely modal part of the logic [Schr\u00f6der 2007;\nSchr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009]. First some notation.\nDefinition 3.2. We denote the set of propositional formulas over a set Z by Prop(Z),\nand the set {\u2665a | \u2665 \u2208 \u039b, a \u2208 Z} by \u039b(Z). A literal over Z is either an element of Z or the\nnegation of such an element, i.e. has the form \u01ebz where z \u2208 Z and \u01eb \u2208 {*, \u00ac} is either\nnothing or negation. A (disjunctive) clause is a finite (possibly empty) disjunction of\nliterals; a conjunctive clause is a finite conjunction of literals. A clause (disjunctive or\nconjunctive) is contracted if it contains every literal at most once. For \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Prop(Z),\nwe say that \u03c6 propositionally entails \u03c8, and write \u03c6 \u22a2PL \u03c8, if \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 is a propositional\ntautology. Similarly, \u03a6 \u2286 Prop(Z) propositionally entails \u03c8 (\u03a6 \u22a2PL \u03c8) if there exist\n\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n \u2208 \u03a6 such that \u03c61 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c6n \u22a2PL \u03c8. We write 2 for the set {\u22a5, \u22a4} of truth\nvalues. For \u03c6 \u2208 Prop(Z), we denote the evaluation of \u03c6 in the Boolean algebra PX\nunder a valuation \u03c4 : Z \u2192 PX by [[\u03c6]]X,\u03c4 , and write X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6 if [[\u03c6]]X,\u03c4 = X. For\n\u03c8 \u2208 Prop(\u039b(Prop(Z))), the interpretation J\u03c8KT X,\u03c4 of \u03c8 in the Boolean algebra P(T X)\nunder \u03c4 is the inductive extension of the assignment J\u2665(z)KT X,\u03c4 = J\u2665KX \u03c4 (z). We write\nT X, \u03c4 |= \u03c8 if J\u03c8KT X,\u03c4 = T X. A propositional formula over \u039b(V ) is injective if it mentions\nevery variable at most once.\nWe can now give the formal definition of the modal rule format.\nDefinition 3.3. A one-step rule R = \u03c6/\u03c7 consists of a premise \u03c6 \u2208 Prop(V ) and a\nconclusion \u03c7 which is an injective (disjunctive) clause over \u039b(V ) (recall that V is the\n11\n\n\fset of variables), where every variable in \u03c6 appears also in \u03c7. We say that R is monotone\n(a notion similar to one introduced by Cirstea et al. [2011] for rules phrased without\nnegation) if whenever \u03c7 is positive (negative) in a variable a \u2208 V then \u03c6 is positive\n(negative) in a. The rule R is one-step sound if whenever X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6 for a valuation\n\u03c4 : V \u2192 PX, then T X, \u03c4 |= \u03c7. A set R of one-step rules is one-step complete if, whenever\nT X, \u03c4 |= \u03c8 for a set X, an injective clause \u03c8 over \u039b(V ), and a PX-valuation \u03c4 , then \u03c8\nis provable over X, \u03c4 , i.e. propositionally entailed by clauses \u03c7\u03c3 where \u03c6/\u03c7 \u2208 R and \u03c3\nis a Prop(V )-substitution such that X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6\u03c3. Moreover, R is one-step cutfree complete\nif, whenever T X, \u03c4 |= \u03c8 for X, \u03c4, \u03c8 as above, then \u03c8 is cutfree provable over X, \u03c4 , i.e.\n\u03c7 \u22a2PL \u03c8 for some \u03c6/\u03c7 \u2208 R such that X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6.\nRemark 3.4. In the terminology of [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009], one-step cutfree\ncomplete rule sets correspond to one-step complete rule sets which are closed under\ncontraction, resolution, and injective renamings of the propositional variables. Notice\nin particular that \u03c7 as in the definition of cutfree provability is injective, being the\nconclusion of a one-step rule, and hence contracted.\nAs the last parameter of the framework, we\nfix from now on a one-step complete set R of one-step sound one-step rules,\nand denote the arising logic by L\u266f .\nRules \u03c6/\u03c8 \u2208 R are applied in substituted form, i.e for every substitution \u03c3, we may\nconclude \u03c8\u03c3 from \u03c6\u03c3. In summary, the proof system consists of propositional reasoning,\nthe unfolding axiom, the fixpoint induction rule, and the rules in R. It is easy to see\nthat this system is sound. As usual, we write \u22a2 \u03c6 if a formula \u03c6 is provable. We say\nthat \u03c6 is consistent if \u00ac\u03c6 is not provable. One should note that the system without the\nfixpoint rules (i.e. comprising only propositional reasoning and a one-step complete set\nof modal rules) is complete for the fixpoint-free language [Schr\u00f6der 2007].\nWe conclude the technical part of the section with some facts on the relationship\nbetween the two notions of one-step completeness.\nDefinition 3.5. A one-step rule \u03c6/\u03c7 is R-derivable if it is propositionally entailed by\nconclusions \u03c8\u03c3 of rules \u03c1/\u03c8 \u2208 R where \u03c3 is a Prop(V )-substitution and \u03c6 \u22a2PL \u03c1\u03c3.\nL EMMA 3.6. All one-step sound one-step rules are R-derivable.\nP ROOF. Let \u03c6/\u03c7 be one-step sound. Let V0 \u2286 V be the set of propositional variables\nthat occur in \u03c7, and put\nX = {\u03ba : V0 \u2192 2 | \u03ba |= \u03c6}\n\n\u03c4 (a) = {\u03ba \u2208 X | \u03ba(a) = \u22a4}.\n\nThen X, \u03ba |= \u03c6, so that T X, \u03ba |= \u03c7 by one-step soundness. By one-step completeness\nof R, \u03c7 is propositionally entailed by clauses \u03c8\u03c3 where \u03c1/\u03c8 \u2208 R and \u03c3 is a Prop(V )substitution such that X, \u03c4 |= \u03c1\u03c3. It suffices to show that \u03c6 \u22a2PL \u03c1\u03c3, which however is\nclear by construction of X, \u03c4 .\nL EMMA 3.7. The set of R-derivable monotone one-step rules is one-step cutfree complete.\nIn other words, a clause over \u039b(V ) is provable over X, \u03c4 iff it is cutfree provable over X, \u03c4\nusing an R-derivable monotone one-step rule. We thus say that a conjunctive clause \u03c1\nover \u039b(V ) is one-step \u03c4 -consistent for \u03c4 : V \u2192 PX if \u00ac\u03c1 is not provable over X, \u03c4 ,\nequivalently not cutfree provable over X, \u03c4 using an R-derivable monotone one-step\nrule.\nP ROOF. By Lemma 3.6, this follows once we show that the set of one-step sound\nmonotone one-step rules is one-step cutfree complete. This is proved by Cirstea et\n12\n\n\fal. [2011, Proposition 4.7] for a formally even more restrictive class of rules (also called\nmonotone1).\nExample 3.8. One-step complete rule systems have been exhibited for all logics of Example 2.3 and many more [Pattinson 2003; C\u0131\u0302rstea and Pattinson 2007;\nSchr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009;\nPattinson and Schr\u00f6der 2010;\nKupke and Pattinson 2010].\nIn\nsome\ncases\n[C\u0131\u0302rstea and Pattinson 2007;\nPattinson 2003], axiomatizations have been phrased in terms of one-step axioms,\ni.e. formulas in \u03c6 \u2208 Prop(\u039b(Prop(V ))) that can be introduced in substituted form \u03c6\u03c3\nwith \u03c3 a substitution of propositional variables by formulas; it has been shown that\nthis format is interconvertible with one-step rules [Schr\u00f6der 2007]. We recall some\nexamples in more detail, converting to one-step rules where necessary.\n(1) Kripke semantics: The standard axiomatization of the modal logic K1 , with 21\nwritten as just 2, can be phrased in terms of one-step rules for necessitation, monotonicity, and normality as\na\na\u2192b\na\u2227b \u2192c\n2a 2a \u2192 2b 2a \u2227 2b \u2192 2c\nwhere here and in the following, we write clauses \u00aca1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 \u00acan \u2228 b1 \u2228 . . . bm as implications a1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 an \u2192 b1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 bm . Given this axiomatization, a one-step rule\n\u03c6/\u03c8 is R-derivable iff \u03c8 contains disjuncts \u00ac2a1 , . . . , \u00ac2an , 2b (with n \u2265 0) such that\n\u03c6 \u22a2PL a1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 an \u2192 b.\nA more restricted semantics over serial Kripke models as for serial CTL (Example 2.3.1) is reflected in the additional rule\n\u00aca\n.\n\u00ac2a\nRestricting additionally to deterministic models as used for LTL (and switching from\n2 to # as customary) logically corresponds to adding the rule\na\u2228b\n#a \u2228 #b\n(which, given the other rules, is mutually interderivable with the better-known axiom\n\u00ac # a \u2192 #\u00aca).\n(2) Graded fixpoint logics: Rephrasing a known complete axiomatization of graded\nmodal logic [De Caro 1988], we obtain the rules\na\u2192b\nc\u2192a\u2228b\n(A1)\n3n+1 a \u2192 3n b\n3n1 +n2 c \u2192 3n1 a \u2228 3n2 b\na\u2228b\u2192c\na\u2227b\u2192d\n\u00aca\n(A2)\n(RN )\n.\n3n1 a \u2227 3n2 b \u2192 3n1 +n2 +1 c \u2228 30 d\n\u00ac30 a\n(RG1)\n\nThese rules are clearly one-step sound. They have previously been shown to be onestep complete [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009] by reference to the previous completeness proof for graded modal logic; we give a simple stand-alone proof in Lemma 3.10.\n(3) Probabilistic fixpoint logics: We can reuse the one-step complete rule set for\nprobabilistic modal logic [Heifetz and Mongin 2001; C\u0131\u0302rstea and Pattinson 2007]. For\n1 Specifically,\n\na rule is monotone in the sense of Cirstea at al. if its premise is a positive formula and its\nconclusion is a disjunction of atoms of the form \u2665a or \u2665a; in fact, monotone rules in our sense can be\ntransformed into this format by taking negation normal forms and substituting away negated variables.\n\n13\n\n\fthe extended language with linear inequalities on probabilities, one has the onestep cutfree complete rule set given by Kupke and Pattinson [2010], noting that onestep cutfree complete rule sets can be restricted to any subset of the modal operators [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009], in particular to monotone linear inequalities.\n(4) Conditional fixpoint logics: one-step complete rule sets are known for various\nflavours of conditional logic [Pattinson and Schr\u00f6der 2010; Schr\u00f6der et al. 2010].\n(5) Alternating-time \u03bc-calculus: The following one-step complete set of rules is implicit in [Pauly 2002] (see also [Schr\u00f6der and Pattinson 2009]):\n\u00aca\na\na\u2228b\na\u2227b \u2192c\n\u00ac[C]a [C]a [0]a \u2228 [N ]b [C]a \u2227 [D]b \u2192 [C \u222a D]c\nwhere C and D are disjoint in the last rule. In words: no coalition can enforce the logically impossible; every coalition can enforce logical tautologies; either a is unavoidable\nor \u00aca can be enforced by all agents in collaboration; and disjoint coalitions can combine\ntheir abilities.\n(6) Monotone fixpoint logics: When we interpret 2 over the monotone neighbourhood\nfunctor, we have only the rule\na\u2192b\n.\n2a \u2192 2b\nSeriality is captured by the additional rules\na\n\u00aca\n.\n2a\n\u00ac2a\nRemark 3.9. We point out that in all examples with finite modal similarity type \u039b,\nthe rule sets given above are finite, so that our completeness result will establish finite axiomatizability; this holds in particular for alternating-time logics. When \u039b is\ninfinite, we cannot reasonably expect a finite axiomatization. The rules for graded\nmodalities are locally finite in the sense that every modality is mentioned only\nin finitely many axioms. The rules for probabilistic logic [Heifetz and Mongin 2001;\nC\u0131\u0302rstea and Pattinson 2007] do not have this property, and it remains open whether a\nlocally finite axiomatization is possible in this case.\nWe conclude the section with the announced stand-alone proof of one-step completeness of the rules for graded modal logic:\nL EMMA 3.10. The rules (RG1), (A1), (A2), and (RN ) (Example 3.8.2) are one-step\ncomplete for graded modal logic.\nP ROOF. Let \u03c4 : V \u2192 PX. We extend the notion of one-step \u03c4 -consistency to infinite\nconjunctive clauses, i.e. infinite sets of literals, over \u039b(V ) in the evident way: a set \u03a6 of\nliterals over \u039b(V ) is one-step \u03c4 -consistent if for all \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1n \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c11 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c1n is one-step\n\u03c4 -consistent. As usual, one-step completeness dualizes to showing that a given onestep \u03c4 -consistent clause \u03c6 is one-step \u03c4 -satisfiable, i.e. [[\u03c6]]BX,\u03c4 6= \u2205. We can assume that\nX is finite (see [Schr\u00f6der 2007, Proposition 23], [Myers et al. 2009, Lemma 30]), and\nthen that \u03c4 : V \u2192 PX is surjective. By a standard argument, there exists a maximal\ninfinite conjunctive clause \u03a6 over \u039b(V ) that is one-step \u03c4 -consistent and contains \u03c6.\n(Note that the argument is entirely generic\nT up to this point.) We construct a multiset\n\u03bc \u2208 BX that satisfies \u03a6 over \u03c4 , i.e. \u03bc \u2208 \u03c6\u2208\u03a6 [[\u03c6]]T X,\u03c4 . Specifically, we define \u03bc as an\nN \u222a {\u221e}-valued measure on X by\n\u03bc(A) = max{k + 1 | 3k a \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c4 (a) = A}\nfor A \u2286 X, where by convention max \u2205 = 0. To see that \u03bc is really a measure, note first\nthat \u03bc(\u2205) = 0 by (RN ), applied to a such that \u03c4 (a) = \u2205. Moreover, \u03bc is additive, i.e.\n14\n\n\f\u03bc(A \u222a B) = \u03bc(A) + \u03bc(B) for disjoint A, B. (Since X is finite, there is no issue about \u03bc\nbeing \u03c3-additive.) Here, \u2265 is by (A2) and (RN ), applied to a, b, c, d such that \u03c4 (a) = A,\n\u03c4 (b) = B, \u03c4 (d) = \u2205, and \u03c4 (c) = A \u222a B. Similarly, \u2264 is by (A1) applied to a, b, c such\nthat \u03c4 (a) = A, \u03c4 (b) = B, and \u03c4 (c) = A \u222a B. It remains to show that \u03bc \u2208 [[3k a]]T X,\u03c4 iff\n3k a \u2208 \u03a6. 'If ' is immediate by the definition of \u03bc, and 'only if ' is by (RG1).\n4. CONSTRUCTIVE FIXPOINTS\n\nOur next aim is to prove that the Lindenbaum algebra of L\u266f is constructive, i.e. its fixpoints can be iteratively approximated in \u03c9 steps. In terms of consistency of formulas,\nthis means that whenever a formula of the form \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent, then already\n\u03b3 i (\u03c6)(\u22a5) \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent for some i < \u03c9; this fact will play a pivotal role in the model\nconstruction in Section 5. We begin by introducing the requisite algebraic tools.\nDefinition 4.1. A \u039b-algebra is a Boolean algebra A with a monotone operation \u2665A :\nA \u2192 A for each \u2665 \u2208 \u039b. In a \u039b-algebra A, a modal fixpoint scheme \u03c6 with n variables\nis interpreted as an operation \u03c6A : An \u2192 A in the evident way. A \u266f-algebra is a \u039balgebra A that is endowed with operations \u266fA\n\u03b3 for each \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 such that for each a \u2208 A,\nA\nA\n\u266f\u03b3 (a) is the least fixpoint of the map \u03b3 (a, \u2212) : A \u2192 A (in particular, these fixpoints\nexist in a \u266f-algebra). In a \u266f-algebra A, every fixpoint formula with variables \u03c6(v1 , . . . , vn )\nis interpreted as a function \u03c6A : An \u2192 A. We say that A validates a rule R = \u03c6/\u03c8 if\n\u03c8 A (a1 , . . . , an ) = \u22a4 whenever \u03c6A (a1 , . . . , an ) = \u22a4, for a1 , . . . , an \u2208 A. An L\u266f -algebra is a\n\u266f-algebra A that validates every rule in our fixed set R of one-step rules.\nIn the tradition of algebraic logic, L\u266f -algebras provide an algebraic encoding of our\nproof system. More specifically, we will be interested in the Lindenbaum algebra A(L\u266f )\nof our logic. As usual, this algebra is defined as the quotient of the set F\u266f of formulas\nunder the congruence relation \u2261 of provable equivalence (\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c8 iff \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8), equipped\nwith the algebra structure that just interprets every connective as itself. (The congruence property of \u2261 follows from the fact that both the modalities and the fixpoint\noperators come with congruence rules, the former by one-step completeness and the\nlatter by Lemma 3.1.) An easy induction shows that every formula \u03c6 is interpreted as\nthe element \u03c6A(L\u266f ) = [\u03c6] of this algebra, where [\u03c6] denotes the equivalence class of \u03c6\nunder \u2261; when there is no danger of confusion, we may write \u03c6 in place of [\u03c6]. The\nKozen-Park axiomatization ensures that A(L\u266f ) actually is an L\u266f -algebra:\nL EMMA 4.2. The Lindenbaum algebra is the initial L\u266f -algebra.\nP ROOF. The unfolding axiom makes \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 a prefixpoint of \u03c6A(L\u266f ) (\u03c6, \u2212) in A(L\u266f ), and\nthe fixpoint induction rule ensures that \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 is the least such, because every element of\nA(L\u266f ) is the denotation of a formula. This shows that A(L\u266f ) is an L\u266f -algebra. Initiality\nis then straightforward: if B is an L\u266f -algebra, then B validates the unfolding axiom and\nthe fixpoint induction rule so that we have a well-defined map f : A(L\u266f ) \u2192 B given\nby f ([\u03c6]) = \u03c6B . By construction of the algebra structure on A(L\u266f ), f is homomorphic\nw.r.t. all algebraic operators (Boolean, modal, and fixpoint). Uniqueness of f is shown\nby induction over formulas in the usual way, using the fact that the fixpoint operators\nare explicitly included in the algebra structure.\nIn these terms, our target property is phrased as follows.\nDefinition 4.3. We say that \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 is constructive if\n_\n\u03b3(\u03c6)i (\u22a5)\n\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 =\ni<\u03c9\n\n15\n\n\fin the Lindenbaum algebra A(L\u266f ), i.e. if \u22a2 \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 whenever \u22a2 \u03b3(\u03c6)i (\u22a5) \u2192 \u03c8 for all\ni < \u03c9. If all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 are constructive, then A(L\u266f ) is constructive.\nWe explicitly state the dual formulation of this property:\nL EMMA 4.4. Let \u03b3 be constructive. If \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent, then \u03b3(\u03c6)i (\u22a5) \u2227 \u03c8 is\nconsistent for some i < \u03c9.\nThe central tool for proving constructivity, introduced by Santocanale [2008] and featuring prominently in subsequent work by Santocanale and Venema [2010], is the\nnotion of a finitary O-adjoint:\nDefinition 4.5. We say that a formula \u03c6 with a variable x is an O-adjoint if for all\n\u03c8 \u2208 F\u266f , there exists a finite set G\u03c6 (\u03c8) of formulas such that for all \u03c1 \u2208 F\u266f ,\n\u22a2 \u03c6(\u03c1) \u2192 \u03c8 iff \u22a2 \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7 for some \u03c7 \u2208 G\u03c6 (\u03c8),\ni.e. \u03c6(\u03c1) \u2264 \u03c8 in A(L\u266f ) iff \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c7 for some \u03c7 \u2208 G\u03c6 (\u03c8). Moreover, \u03c6 is a finitary O-adjoint if\nG\u03c6 can be chosen such that for every \u03c8, the closure of \u03c8 under G\u03c6 , i.e. the smallest set\nA with \u03c8 \u2208 A and \u03c7 \u2208 A \u21d2 G\u03c6 (\u03c7) \u2286 A, is finite. We say that a modal fixpoint scheme\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 is a (finitary) O-adjoint if \u03b3(\u03c6) is a (finitary) O-adjoint for all \u03c6 \u2208 F\u266f .\nL EMMA 4.6. [Santocanale 2008] Every finitary O-adjoint is constructive.\nDefinition 4.7. Let \u03c6 be a formula (possibly with variables) such that \u03c6 contains\nsome modal operator and every occurrence of a variable in \u03c6 is in the scope of some\nmodal operator. Let \u03c6\u2032 be the equivalent formula that arises by unfolding all top-level\noccurrences of \u266f once (where an occurrence is top-level if it is not in the scope of a modal\nor fixpoint operator). By guardedness of fixpoint operators, \u03c6\u2032 is of the form \u03c60 \u03c3, where\n\u03c60 \u2208 Prop(\u039b(V )) is injective and \u03c3 is a substitution. We refer to the equivalence \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c60 \u03c3\n(or more precisely the pair (\u03c60 , \u03c3)) as the top-level decomposition of \u03c6.\nThe first step in the proof of O-adjointness for a large class of operators is a generalization of the rigidity lemma of [Santocanale 2008]:\nL EMMA 4.8 (R IGIDITY). Let \u03c8 be a clause over \u039b(F\u266f ), with top-level decomposition\n\u03c8 \u2261 \u03c80 \u03c30 . Then \u03c8 is provable iff there exists an R-derivable monotone one-step rule \u03c6/\u03c7\nsuch that \u03c6\u03c30 is provable and \u03c7 \u22a2PL \u03c80 .\nThe proof relies on the one-point extension of an algebra (so called because it mimics the addition of a new root point in a coalgebraic model on the algebraic side), in\ngeneralization of a similar construction by Santocanale and Venema [2010]:\nLet A be a countable L\u266f -algebra, let S(A) be the set of ultrafilters of A, fix a surjective\nmap \u03c3 : V \u2192 A, and let an injective conjunctive clause \u03c1 over \u039b(V ) be one-step \u03b8consistent for \u03b8 : V \u2192 P(S(A)) given by \u03b8 = j \u25e6 \u03c3 (applicative composition) where\nj : A \u2192 P(S(A)) is the usual canonical map j(a) = {u \u2208 S(A) | a \u2208 u}. We construct\nthe one-point extension A\u03c1 , an L\u266f -algebra emulating the addition of a new point whose\nsuccessor structure is described by \u03c1, as follows. To begin, we can find a maximally\none-step cutfree \u03b8-consistent set \u03a6 \u2286 \u039b(V ) such that \u03a6 \u22a2PL \u03c1. As we emulate adding a\nsingle point, the carrier of A\u03c1 is A \u00d7 2 where 2 is the Boolean algebra {\u22a5, \u22a4}; we thus\nhave projection maps \u03c01 : A\u03c1 \u2192 A and \u03c02 : A\u03c1 \u2192 2. We make A\u03c1 into a \u039b-algebra by\nputting\n\u03c1\n\n\u2665A (a, d) = (\u2665A (a), \u2665\u03c1 (a)),\n\u03c1\n\nwhere \u2665\u03c1 : A \u2192 2 is defined by \u2665\u03c1 (a) = \u22a4 iff \u2665a \u2208 \u03a6\u03c3. (Thus, \u2665A (a, d) is independent\nof d, in agreement with the semantic fact that the interpretation of modal operators\n16\n\n\fdepends only on the successor structure of the current state, not on the current state\nitself.) We define a valuation \u03c3\u0302 : V \u2192 A\u03c1 by\n\u001a\n(\u03c3(v), \u22a5) if v occurs in a positive literal in \u03c1\n\u03c3\u0302(v) =\n(\u03c3(v), \u22a4) otherwise.\nWe then have\n\u03c1\u03c3\u0302 > \u22a5 in A\u03c1 :\n\n(3)\n\nby definition of A\u03c1 , the second component of \u03c1\u03c3\u0302 is \u22a4 because \u03a6\u03c3 \u22a2PL \u03c1\u03c3.\nL EMMA 4.9. The algebra A\u03c1 is an L\u266f -algebra.\nP ROOF. The proof that A\u03c1 is a \u266f-algebra is a simple application of Bekic's theorem,\nas in [Santocanale and Venema 2010]: since A\u03c1 has carrier A\u00d72, the fixpoint definition\nof (\u03c8, c) = \u266f\u03b3 (\u03c6, b) in A\u03c1 can be seen as a mutually recursive definition of two variables\n\u03c8, c. By guardedness of fixpoints and the interpretation of modalities in A\u03c1 , the definition of the first variable \u03c8 does not mention the second variable c, so we can calculate\nthe solution for \u03c8 separately, using the fact that A is a \u266f-algebra, and then replace \u03c8\nwith its solution \u266f\u03b3 (\u03c8) in the recursive definition of the second variable c. We end up\nwith c being defined as the least fixpoint of a monotone function on 2, which exists\nbecause 2 is a complete lattice.\nIt remains to prove that A\u03c1 validates the one-step rules in R. The first component of\n\u03c1\nA behaves just like A, so that we have to verify the rules only on the second component, 2. That is, whenever we have a one-step rule \u03c7/\u03c8 \u2208 R and a valuation \u03c4 : V \u2192 A\u03c1\nsuch that \u03c7\u03c4 = \u22a4 in A\u03c1 , we have to prove that \u03c02 \u03c8\u03c4 = \u22a4. Since \u03c8\u03c4 depends only on \u03c01 \u03c4 ,\nwe thus have to prove that whenever we have \u03c4 \u2032 : V \u2192 A such that \u03c7\u03c4 \u2032 = \u22a4 in A, the\ninterpretation of \u03c8\u03c4 \u2032 in 2 is \u22a4, where the interpretation of \u03c8\u03c4 \u2032 is determined by means\nof the \u2665\u03c1 and the Boolean algebra structure of 2. Since \u03c3 is surjective, we have \u03c4 \u2032 = \u03c3\u25e6 \u03c4\u0302\n(applicative composition) for some renaming \u03c4\u0302 : V \u2192 V . It now follows that \u03a6 \u22a2PL \u03c8\u03c4\u0302 :\nOtherwise, by maximality of of \u03a6, we would have \u03a6 \u22a2PL \u00ac\u03c8\u03c4\u0302 . Since \u03a6 is one-step \u03b8consistent, this implies that [[\u00ac\u03c7\u03c4\u0302 ]]S(A),\u03b8 6= \u2205. But since \u03b8\u25e6 \u03c4\u0302 = j \u25e6\u03c3\u25e6 \u03c4\u0302 = j \u25e6\u03c4 \u2032 , [[\u00ac\u03c7\u03c4\u0302 ]]S(A),\u03b8\nis the image of \u00ac\u03c7\u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 A under the Boolean homomorphism j : A \u2192 P(S(A)). This implies \u00ac\u03c7\u03c4 \u2032 6= \u22a5, in contradiction to \u03c7\u03c4 \u2032 = \u22a4.\nIn consequence of the fact that A(L\u266f ) is the initial L\u266f -algebra, we thus have\nL EMMA 4.10. Let \u03c3 : V \u2192 A(L\u266f ) be surjective, and let \u03c1 be a conjunctive clause\nover \u039b(V ). If \u03c1 is one-step \u03b8-consistent for \u03b8(v) = {u \u2208 S(A(L\u266f )) | \u03c3(v) \u2208 u}, then \u03c1\u03c3 is\nconsistent, i.e. \u03c1\u03c3 > \u22a5 in A(L\u266f ).\nP ROOF. Let f be the unique L\u266f -algebra homomorphism A(L\u266f ) \u2192 A(L\u266f )\u03c1 , and take\n\u03c3\u0302 : V \u2192 A(L\u266f )\u03c1 as above. Note that the first projection \u03c01 : A(L\u266f )\u03c1 \u2192 A(L\u266f ) is a\nhomomorphism of L\u266f -algebras by construction of A(L\u266f )\u03c1 . By the uniqueness part of\ninitiality, it follows that \u03c01 \u25e6 f = id. For a \u2208 V , we therefore have \u03c01 (f (\u03c3(a)) = \u03c3(a) =\n\u03c01 (\u03c3\u0302(a)); moreover, if a occurs in a positive literal in \u03c1, then \u03c02 (f (\u03c3(a))) \u2265 \u22a5 = \u03c02 (\u03c3\u0302(a)),\nand if a occurs in a negative literal in \u03c1 (hence does not occur in a positive literal,\nsince \u03c1 is injective), then \u03c02 (f (\u03c3(a))) \u2264 \u22a4 = \u03c02 (\u03c3\u0302(a)). Since the order on A(L\u266f )\u03c1 is\ncomponentwise, this implies that f \u25e6 \u03c3(a) \u2265 \u03c3\u0302(a) if a occurs in a positive literal in \u03c1,\nand f \u25e6 \u03c3(a) \u2264 \u03c3\u0302(a) if a occurs in a negative literal in \u03c1. Since f is homomorphic and\nthe modalities are monotone, it follows by (3) that f (\u03c1\u03c3) = \u03c1(f \u25e6 \u03c3) \u2265 \u03c1\u03c3\u0302 > \u22a5. Since f\npreserves \u22a5, this implies \u03c1\u03c3 > \u22a5.\nFrom Lemma 4.10, one easily proves rigidity (Lemma 4.8) using the fact that every\nconsistent formula is contained in some ultrafilter of A(L\u266f ):\n17\n\n\fP ROOF (L EMMA 4.8). 'If ' is clear. For 'only if ', we prove the dual statement: Let \u03c8 be\na conjunctive clause over \u039b(F\u266f ), with top-level decomposition \u03c8 \u2261 \u03c80 \u03c30 , such that \u00ac\u03c6\u03c30\nis consistent for all R-derivable monotone one-step rules \u03c6/\u03c7 and all substitutions \u03c3\nsuch that \u03c7 \u22a2PL \u00ac\u03c80 ; we show that \u03c8 is consistent. W.l.o.g. \u03c30 is a surjection V \u2192\nF\u266f , which we prolong to a surjection \u03c3\u03040 : V \u2192 A(L\u266f ). By Lemma 4.10, it suffices to\nprove that \u03c80 (a conjunctive clause over \u039b(V )) is one-step \u03b8-consistent for \u03b8(v) = {u \u2208\nS(A(L\u266f )) | \u03c3\u03040 (v) \u2208 u}. Thus, let \u03c6/\u03c7 be an R-derivable rule such that \u03c7 \u22a2PL \u00ac\u03c80 . We\nhave to show that S(A(L\u266f )), \u03b8 6|= \u03c6. By assumption and because \u03c7 \u22a2PL \u00ac\u03c80 , we have\nthat \u00ac\u03c6\u03c30 is consistent, hence \u00ac\u03c6\u03c3\u03040 > \u22a5 in A(L\u266f ), so that there exists u \u2208 S(A(L\u266f ))\nwith \u00ac\u03c6\u03c3\u03040 \u2208 u.

In particular, we have u \u2208 [[\u00ac\u03c6]]S(A(L\u266f )),\u03b8 ,\nshowing that S(A(L\u266f )), \u03b8 6|= \u03c6 as required.\nIn a nutshell, rigidity enables us to prove O-adjointness of all (monotone) modal operators, and even more generally all modal fixpoint schemes in which the recursion\nvariable x occurs at uniform depth (such as 23x \u2227 32x). Formally:\nDefinition 4.11. A formula \u03c6 with variables is uniform of depth k if every occurrence of the fixed recursion variable x in \u03c6 is in the scope of exactly k modal operators\n(including the case that x does not occur in \u03c6; recall moreover that variables never\noccur under fixpoint operators). Moreover, \u03c6 is uniform if \u03c6 is uniform of depth k for\nsome k; the minimal such k is the depth of uniformity of \u03c6. Formally, uniform formulas\nare defined inductively by following inductive clauses.\n- x is uniform of depth 0;\n- formulas not containing x are uniform of depth k, for any k;\n- any Boolean combination of uniform formulas of depth k is uniform of depth k; and\n- if \u03c8 is uniform of depth k, then \u2665\u03c8 is uniform of depth k + 1, for \u2665 \u2208 \u039b.\nFinitariness of O-adjoints will use the standard Fischer-Ladner closure:\nDefinition 4.12. A set \u03a3 of formulas is Fischer-Ladner closed if \u03a3 is closed under\nsubformulas and negation (where the negation of a negated formula \u00ac\u03c6 is taken to\nbe \u03c6), and whenever \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a3, then \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6) \u2208 \u03a3.

[Kozen 1983] The set FL(\u03c6) is finite.\nThe further development revolves largely around derivable rules:\nDefinition 4.14. A rule R = \u03c6/\u03c8 consists of a premise \u03c6 and a conclusion \u03c8, both\nbeing formulas with variables. The rule R is derivable if \u03c8 can be derived from the assumption \u03c6 using the rules of the system (propositional reasoning, unfolding, fixpoint\ninduction, modal rules).\nL EMMA 4.15.

By unfolding (guarded) top-level fixpoints (i.e. those not in the\nscope of a modality) and then applying propositional reasoning to transform into CNF,\nwe reduce to the case that \u03c8 is a clause over \u039b(FL(\u03c8)); note here that these transformations remain within Prop(FL(\u03c8)). Let \u03c8 \u2261 \u03c80 \u03c30 be the top-level decomposition of \u03c8;\nthen the top-level decomposition of \u03c8(\u03c1) has the form \u03c80 \u03c30\u03c1 where \u03c30\u03c1 (a) = \u03c30 (a)(\u03c1).

This\nis seen by case distinction over \u03c6[\u22a4/y]: First, assume \u03c6[\u22a4/y]; then \u03c6[\u22a4/y] is equivalent\nto \u22a4, so \u03c6[\u22a4/y] propositionally entails \u03c6[\u03c6[\u22a4/y]/y] because y has only top-level occurrences in \u03c6. Second, assume \u00ac\u03c6[\u22a4/y]. From \u03c6[\u22a4/y] \u2228 \u03c6[\u22a5/y] we then conclude \u03c6[\u22a5/y].\nSince by assumption, \u03c6[\u22a4/y] is equivalent to \u22a5, this, again, propositionally entails\n\u03c6[\u03c6[\u22a4/y]/y].\nWe are now set to prove the main result of this section:\nT HEOREM 4.18 (F INITARY O- ADJOINTNESS ). If the formula \u03c8 with recursion variable x is positive and uniform in x, then the operation \u03c8 A(L\u266f ) : A(L\u266f ) \u2192 A(L\u266f ) induced\nby \u03c8 is a finitary O-adjoint.\nP ROOF. For readability, we phrase the arguments using formulas in F\u266f rather than\nelements of A(L\u266f ). Let \u03c6 \u2208 F\u266f . We have to construct a set G\u03c8 (\u03c6) of formulas such that\nfor all \u03c1 \u2208 F\u266f , \u22a2 \u03c8(\u03c1) \u2192 \u03c6 iff \u22a2 \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7 for some \u03c7 \u2208 G\u03c8 (\u03c6); moreover we require G\u03c8 (\u03c6)\nto be finite up to provable equivalence.\nThe formula \u03c8 \u2032 :\u2261 \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6 is uniform (as \u03c6 does not contain x). Let G \u2286 Prop(FL(\u03c8 \u2032 ))\nbe as in Lemma 4.16, applied to \u03c8 \u2032 ; notice that Prop(FL(\u03c8 \u2032 )) is finite up to provable\nequivalence. Then put\nG\u03c8 (\u03c6) = {\u03c7(\u22a4) | \u03c7(x) \u2208 G, \u22a2 \u03c7(\u22a4) \u2228 \u03c7(\u22a5)}.\nNow let \u22a2 \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7(\u22a4) for some \u03c7(x) \u2208 G such that \u22a2 \u03c7(\u22a4)\u2228\u03c7(\u22a5). To show that \u22a2 \u03c8(\u03c1) \u2192 \u03c6,\nit suffices by construction of G and positivity of \u03c8 to prove that \u22a2 \u03c7(a) \u2227 (\u03c1 \u2192 a) for\nsome formula a: then it follows that \u22a2 (\u03c8(a) \u2192 \u03c6) \u2227 (\u03c1 \u2192 a), and hence by Lemma 4.15\nthat \u22a2 \u03c8(\u03c1) \u2192 \u03c6. Since \u03c7 \u2227 (\u03c1 \u2192 x) is uniform of depth 0, existence of such an a follows\nby Lemma 4.17 once we show that\n\u22a2 (\u03c7(\u22a4) \u2227 (\u03c1 \u2192 \u22a4)) \u2228 (\u03c7(\u22a5) \u2227 (\u03c1 \u2192 \u22a5)),\n19\n\n\fequivalently\n\u22a2 \u03c7(\u22a4) \u2228 (\u00ac\u03c1 \u2227 \u03c7(\u22a5)).\nBy distributing disjunction over conjunction, this last formula is equivalent to\n(\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7(\u22a4)) \u2227 (\u03c7(\u22a5) \u2228 \u03c7(\u22a4))\nand hence provable by assumption.\nConversely, let \u22a2 \u03c8(\u03c1) \u2192 \u03c6. By Lemma 4.16, there exists \u03c7 \u2208 G such that \u03c7(\u03c1)\nis provable. Since \u03c7 is uniform of depth 0, \u03c7(\u03c1) is propositionally equivalent to its\nBoolean expansion (\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7(\u22a4)) \u2227 (\u00ac\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7(\u22a5)) and hence propositionally entails \u03c7(\u22a5) \u2228\n\u03c7(\u22a4), which is therefore provable. That is, we have \u03c7(\u22a4) \u2208 G\u03c8 (\u03c6) and \u22a2 \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c7(\u22a4), as\nrequired.\nThis proves that \u03c8 A(L\u266f ) is O-adjoint. From the above description of G\u03c8 , one sees immediately that \u03c8 A(L\u266f ) is in fact a finitary O-adjoint, as Prop(FL(\u03c8 \u2032 )) is closed under G\u03c8\nand finite up to provable equivalence.\nUsing uniform formulas as a base, we can now exploit some known closure properties\nof finitary O-adjoints [Santocanale 2008].\nDefinition 4.19. The set of admissible modal fixpoint schemes is the closure of the\nset of uniform modal fixpoint schemes under disjunction, conjunction with modal fixpoint schemes not containing the recursion variable x, and substitution for x, the latter\nin the sense that if \u03b3(x) and \u03b4 are admissible, then \u03b3(\u03b4) is admissible.\nC OROLLARY 4.20. If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 is admissible, then \u03b3 is a finitary O-adjoint, and hence\nconstructive.\nP ROOF. The set of finitary O-adjoints is closed under joins, meets with constants,\nand composition [Santocanale 2008].\nFrom now on, we require that every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 is admissible, and hence A(L\u266f ) is constructive; a flat coalgebraic fixpoint logic satisfying this requirement will be called admissible. All fixpoint operators mentioned in Example 2.3 are based on admissible fixpoint\nschemes (in fact, on uniform ones).\nRemark 4.21. The sufficient criterion for O-adjointness given by Santocanale and\nVenema [2010] is that modal fixpoint schemes be harmless, which in the singlemodality case means that modal fixpoint schemes \u03b3, \u03b4 are generated by the grammar\nV\n\u03b3, \u03b4 ::= \u22a4 | x | \u03b3 \u2228 \u03b4 | \u03c7 \u2227 \u03b3 | ki=1 3\u03c6i | 2\u03c6\n\nwhere \u03c7 is a modal formula not mentioning the recursion variable x (but possibly\nmentioning argument variables). This notion is incomparable to admissibility in the\nsense of Definition 4.19; e.g. 3x \u2227 33x is harmless but not admissible, and 32x \u2227\n23x is admissible (in fact, uniform) but not harmless. We leave it as an open problem\nto find a sufficient criterion for O-adjointness that subsumes both admissibility and\nharmlessness. The fixpoint schemes generating the CTL operators are both harmless\nand admissible.\n5. THE MODEL CONSTRUCTION\n\nWe proceed to describe a model construction that uses sets of timed-out formulas as\nstates; a timed-out formula has some of the fixpoints that appear in it annotated with\ntime-outs indicating how often they need to be unfolded. Our time-outs are related to\nKozen's \u03bc-counters [Kozen 1983] but, as indicated, are integrated into formulas rather\nthan maintained independently in a tableau construction. The use of time-outs is justified by constructivity of fixpoint operators as proved in the previous section.\n20\n\n\fSince only some of the fixpoint subformulas contained in a state will be annotated\nwith finite time-outs, only one implication of the truth lemma will hold (every state\nsatisfies the timed-out formulas it contains but not conversely \u2013 the model we construct\nwill be finite, so every fixpoint will be satisfied with some time-out, which the state may\nfail to specify). Consequently, in the inductive proof of the truth lemma, the step for\nnegation would fail. We therefore work with formulas in negation normal form, defined\nin detail as follows. A modal fixpoint scheme is in negation normal form (NNF) if it can\nbe generated by the grammar\n\u03b3, \u03b4 ::= \u22a5 | \u22a4 | v | \u03b3 \u2227 \u03b4 | \u03b3 \u2228 \u03b4 | \u2665\u03b3 | \u2665\u03b3,\n(recall that \u2665 abbreviates \u00ac\u2665\u00ac). We can clearly transform every modal fixpoint scheme\ninto a provably equivalent one in NNF (recall that modal fixpoint schemes are positive\nin all variables), and therefore assume from now on that \u0393 consists of modal fixpoint\nschemes in NNF (this does not substantially affect the syntax as the modal fixpoint\nschemes just serve as indices of fixpoint operators). A formula \u03c6 is in NNF if it can be\ngenerated by the grammar\n\u03c6, \u03c8 ::= \u22a5 | \u22a4 | \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 | \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 | \u2665\u03c6 | \u2665\u03c6 | \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 | \u266d\u03b3 \u03c6.\nThe dual \u03b3 of a modal fixpoint scheme \u03b3 as defined in Section 2 is clearly equivalent\nto the modal fixpoint scheme obtained from \u03b3 by swapping \u2227 with \u2228, \u22a4 with \u22a5, and \u2665\nwith \u2665, and we regard \u03b3 as being syntactically defined in this way from now on; e.g.\nif 3 = 2 then the dual of \u03b3 = p \u2228 2x is \u03b3 = p \u2227 3x. To show that we can transform\nevery formula into NNF, it suffices as usual to show that we can implement negation\non NNFs; this is by the standard procedure of pushing negation inside through the\nother connectives using provable equivalences. In particular, the equivalence\n\u00ac\u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2194 \u266d\u03b3 \u00ac\u03c6\nis trivially provable, as the right hand side is just an abbreviation for \u00ac\u266f\u03b3 \u00ac\u00ac\u03c6. Summing up, we have\nL EMMA 5.1. Every formula is provably equivalent to a formula in NNF.\nIt remains to adapt the notion of Fischer-Ladner closure; as no confusion is likely and\nthe changes are rather inessential, we use the same term:\nDefinition 5.2. A set \u03a3 of formulas in NNF is Fischer-Ladner closed if \u03a3 is closed\nunder subformulas and fixpoint unfolding, i.e. whenever \u22c6\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a3 for \u22c6 \u2208 {\u266f, \u266d} then\n\u03b3(\u03c6, \u22c6\u03b3 \u03c6) \u2208 \u03a3.\nThe analogue of Lemma 4.13 remains true for the modified definition; so from now on\nwe fix a finite Fischer-Ladner closed set \u03a3 of formulas in NNF. We proceed to introduce\nthe announced notion of time-out:\nDefinition 5.3. The set of timed-out formulas \u03c6, \u03c8 is generated by the grammar\n\u03c6, \u03c8 ::= \u22a5 | \u22a4 | \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 | \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 | \u2665\u03c6 | \u2665\u03c6 | \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c1 | \u266d\u03b3 \u03c1\n\n(\u03ba \u2208 \u03c9 + 1, \u03c1 \u2208 L\u266f )\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u2665 \u2208 \u039b, subject to the restriction that \u03c6 is a timed-out formula only in\ncase \u03c6 has at most one subformula of the form \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c7 with \u03ba < \u03c9 (which however may\noccur any number of times), and for this \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c7,\n- \u266f\u03c9\n\u03b3 \u03c7 is not a subformula of \u03c6; and\n- whenever \u266f\u03c9\n\u03b4 \u03c1 is a subformula of \u03c6, then \u266f\u03b4 \u03c1 is a subformula of \u03c7.\nIn this case, we define the time-out \u03c4 (\u03c6) of \u03c6 to be \u03ba, and \u03c4 (\u03c6) = \u03c9 otherwise (i.e. if\n\u03c6 does not contain any subformula of the form \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c7 with \u03ba < \u03c9). The time-out gives\n21\n\n\fthe number of steps left until satisfaction of the eventuality \u266f\u03b3 \u03c7, with time-out \u03c9 signifying an unspecified number of steps (note that time-outs are never associated with\n\u266d-formulas).\nWe define two translations s and t of timed-out formulas into L\u266f , given by commutation with Boolean and modal operators, (\u266d\u03b3 \u03c1)s = (\u266d\u03b3 \u03c1)t = \u266d\u03b3 \u03c1, and\ns\n(\u266f\u03c9\n\u03b3 \u03c1) = \u266f\u03b3 \u03c1\n\n(\u266fi\u03b3 \u03c1)s = \u03b3(\u03c1)i (\u22a5) (i < \u03c9)\n\n(\u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c1)t = \u266f\u03b3 \u03c1.\n\nThus, s unfolds fixpoints as prescribed by their time-outs, and t just removes timeouts. Both translations extend to sets of formulas. For timed-out formulas \u03c6, \u03c8, we\nput \u03c6 \u0016 \u03c8 iff \u03c6t = \u03c8 t and \u03c4 (\u03c6) \u2264 \u03c4 (\u03c8). That is, \u03c6 \u0016 \u03c8 iff \u03c6 is the same as \u03c8 up to\npossible decrease of the time-out. Given a set \u03a3 of formulas, a timed-out formula \u03c6 is a\ntimed-out \u03a3-formula if \u03c6t \u2208 \u03a3.\nNotice that unlike formulas in NNF, timed-out formulas are not closed under negation because time-outs can only appear on least fixpoints. The point of the definition of\ntimed-out formulas is that every standard formula \u03c6 has at most one candidate subformula at which one can insert a time-out, namely the greatest element under the\nsubformula ordering among the subformulas of \u03c6 which are \u266f-formulas, if such a greatest element exists and is not in scope of a \u266d-operator. This enables the simple definition\nof \u0016, which by the preceding discussion has the following property.\nL EMMA 5.4. For every formula \u03c6, the preimage of \u03c6 under the translation t is wellordered by \u0016.\nAt the same time, timed-out formulas are stable under unfolding:\nL EMMA 5.5. If \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6 is a timed-out formula, then so is \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6).\nP ROOF. As \u03c6 is a (standard) formula, it is clear that \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6) cannot contain formulas of the form \u266f\u03bb\u03b4 \u03c1 with \u03bb < \u03c9 other than \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6. By well-foundedness of the subformula\nrelation, \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6) cannot contain \u266f\u03c9\n\u03b3 \u03c6. Finally, the only way \u266f-subformulas can arise in\n\u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6) is as subformulas of \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c6.\nWe have the expected relationship between the translations regarding provable entailment:\nL EMMA 5.6.\n(1) For every timed-out formula \u03c6, \u22a2 \u03c6s \u2192 \u03c6t .\n(2) If \u03c6 \u0016 \u03c8 for timed-out formulas \u03c6, \u03c8, then \u22a2 \u03c6s \u2192 \u03c8 s .\nP ROOF. By iterated application of the unfolding axiom and monotonicity of modal\nfixpoint schemes.\nStates of the model will be sets of formulas satisfying a timed-out version of the usual\nexpandedness requirement.\nDefinition 5.7. A timed-out \u03a3-atom is a maximal set A of timed-out \u03a3-formulas\nsuch that\n- the translation t is injective on A, and\n- As is consistent.\nHere, maximality is w.r.t. \u2291 where A \u2291 B iff for all \u03c6 \u2208 A, there exists a (necessarily\nunique) \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 B such that \u03c6\u2032 \u0016 \u03c6; intuitively: B contains A up to possible decrease of\ntime-outs. We write A\u2191 for the upwards closure of A under \u0016 (i.e. if \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2191 and \u03c6 \u0016 \u03c6\u2032\nthen \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 A\u2191).\n22\n\n\fTo prove finiteness of the model we construct, we use the fact that finite product\norderings (\u03c9 + 1)k are well-quasi-orders, and in particular have only finite antichains [Laver 1976].\nL EMMA 5.8 (T IMED - OUT L INDENBAUM\n\nLEMMA ).\n\n(1) The set of timed-out \u03a3-atoms is finite.\n(2) For every set A0 of timed-out \u03a3-formulas such that As0 is consistent, there exists a\ntimed-out \u03a3-atom A such that A0 \u2291 A.\n(3) For every consistent subset C \u2286 \u03a3, there exists a timed-out \u03a3-atom A such that\nC \u2286 At .\nP ROOF. Claim (3) follows from (2) by converting C into a set of of timed-out formulas\nwith time-out \u03c9. We prove (1) and (2) in one go. Note first that we can assume w.l.o.g.\nthat t is injective on A0 . We define a \u03a3-atom to be a maximally consistent subset of\n\u03a3. The set of \u03a3-atoms is finite, so for every set A0 as in the statement there exists a\n\u03a3-atom C such that At0 \u2286 C. Let A be the set of sets A of timed-out \u03a3-formulas such\nthat As is consistent, t is injective on A, and At = C; the timed-out \u03a3-atoms whose\nt-image is C are the \u2291-maximal elements of A. Now every element A \u2208 A is uniquely\ndetermined by the C-tuple \u03b9(A) of time-outs it induces (explicitly, for \u03c6 \u2208 C, the \u03c6component of \u03b9(A) is \u03c4 (\u03c6\u2032 ) where \u03c6\u2032 is the unique formula in A such that (\u03c6\u2032 )t = \u03c6),\nand for A, B \u2208 A, A \u2291 B iff \u03b9(B) \u2264 \u03b9(A) in the componentwise ordering. Thus, A is\norder-isomorphic to a subset of the finite power (\u03c9 + 1)C of the well-ordering \u03c9 + 1. It\nfollows from the theory of well-quasi-orders that (\u03c9 + 1)C is a well-quasi-order, which\nmeans that for every subset F of (\u03c9 + 1)C , every element of F is above one of finitely\nmany minimal elements of F [Laver 1976]; applying this to A proves (1) and (2) (for (1),\nrecall additionally that the set of \u03a3-atoms is finite).\nAs usual, the proof of the truth lemma will depend on a set of Hintikka-like properties:\nL EMMA 5.9.

Again by maximality of A and Lemma 5.4, we must\n\u03b3\nhave \u03c7 \u0016 \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c6), so that \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c6) \u2208 A\u2191. Similarly, we show that \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c6) \u2208 A\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03ba\nimplies \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2191. Together, these implications yield the same implications for A in\n23\n\n\fplace of A\u2191: e.g. if \u266fi\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2208 A for i < \u03c9 (where necessarily i > 0), then \u03b3(\u03c6, \u266fi\u22121\n\u03b3 \u03c6) \u2208 A\u2191, so\nj\nj+1\n\u03b3(\u03c6, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6) \u2208 A for some j \u2264 i \u2212 1. Thus \u266f\u03b3 \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2191, so that i \u2264 j + 1, implying j = i \u2212 1.\n6: Similar to (and easier than) 5.\nWe denote by T\u03a3 the (by Lemma 5.8, finite) set of timed-out \u03a3-atoms, and proceed\nto construct a model with carrier T\u03a3 . We need to construct a coalgebra rather than\njust a relational structure; this coalgebra should adequately implement the formulas\ncontained in the states. This requirement is encapsulated in the notion of coherence:\nDefinition 5.10. A coalgebra structure \u03be on T\u03a3 is coherent if for every A \u2208 T\u03a3 and\nevery timed-out \u03a3-formula \u2660\u03c1 where \u2660 is either a modal operator \u2665 \u2208 \u039b or a dual\nmodal operator \u2665,\n\u03be(A) \u2208 [[\u2660]]T\u03a3 (\u03c1\u0302) whenever \u2660\u03c1 \u2208 A,\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 = {B \u2208 T\u03a3 | \u03c1 \u2208 B}.\nExistence of such a coherent coalgebra structure relies on one-step completeness.\nL EMMA 5.11 (E XISTENCE\non T\u03a3 .\n\nLEMMA ).\n\nThere exists a coherent coalgebra structure\n\nP ROOF. The proof follows the same pattern as the one for the fixpoint-free\ncase [Schr\u00f6der 2007]. We can construct the coalgebra structure \u03be pointwise. So let\nA \u2208 T\u03a3 ; in the notation of Definition 5.10, we have to show that there exists t \u2208 T T\u03a3\nsuch that t \u2208 [[\u2660]]T\u03a3 (\u03c6\u0302) whenever \u2660\u03c6 \u2208 A. With a view to deriving a contradiction,\nassume the contrary. Then T T\u03a3 , \u03c4 |= \u03c8 where\nW\nW\n\u03c8 = \u2665\u03c1\u2208A \u00ac\u2665a\u2665\u03c1 \u2228 \u2665\u03c1\u2208A \u2665b\u2665\u03c1\n\u03c4 (a\u2665\u03c1 ) = \u03c1\u0302\n\u03c4 (b\u2665\u03c1 ) = T\u03a3 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302\n\nfor pairwise distinct propositional variables a\u2665\u03c1 , b\u2665\u03c1 . By one-step completeness, it follows that \u03c8 is provable over T\u03a3 , \u03c4 , so by Lemma 3.7 there is an R-derivable monotone\none-step rule \u03c6/\u03c7 \u2208 R such that \u03c7 \u22a2PL \u03c8 and T\u03a3 , \u03c4 |= \u03c6. Now let \u03b8 be the substitution defined by \u03b8(a\u2665\u03c1 ) = \u03c1s and \u03b8(b\u2665\u03c1 ) = \u00ac(\u03c1s ). Then As propositionally entails \u00ac\u03c8\u03b8.\nSince As is consistent, we are done once we show that \u03c8\u03b8 is provable. To this end, it\nsuffices to show that \u03c6\u03b8 is provable. Assume the contrary, i.e. \u00ac\u03c6\u03b8 is consistent. Then\nthere is a conjunctive clause \u03c60 in the disjunctive normal form of \u00ac\u03c6 such that \u03c60 \u03b8 is\nconsistent. Since \u03c6/\u03c7 is monotone and \u03c7 \u22a2PL \u03c8 just means that \u03c7 is contained in \u03c8, \u03c6 is\nnegative in the a\u2665\u03c1 and positive in the b\u2665\u03c1 ; thus, \u03c60 is positive in the a\u2665\u03c1 and negative\nV\nin the b\u2665\u03c1 . Therefore, \u03c60 \u03b8 is, after removing double negations, of the form As for a\nset A of timed-out \u03a3-formulas. By the timed-out Lindenbaum lemma (Lemma 5.8), A is\ncontained in a timed-out \u03a3-atom B \u2208 T\u03a3 . Then B \u2208 [[\u03c60 ]]\u03c4 , so B \u2208\n/ [[\u03c6]]\u03c4 , in contradiction\nto T\u03a3 , \u03c4 |= \u03c6.\nNext, we establish that a coherent coalgebra does what we expect:\nL EMMA 5.12 (T RUTH LEMMA). Let \u03be be a coherent coalgebra structure on T\u03a3 . If\nA \u2208 T\u03a3 and \u03c6 \u2208 A, then A |=(T\u03a3 ,\u03be) \u03c6s .\nP ROOF. Induction over timed-out \u03a3-formulas \u03c6 using the lexicographic product\nof the subterm ordering on \u03c6t with \u0016 as the induction measure. We note that by\nLemma 5.6 (and soundness), the inductive hypothesis can be strengthened to apply\nalso to \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2191. The case \u03c6 = \u22a4 is trivial. The steps for \u22a5, \u2227, and \u2228 are taken care of by\nLemma 5.9. The step for modal operators \u2665 or \u2665 is by coherence and monotonicity.\n24\n\n\fNext, we discharge the case \u03c6 = \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c8. By Lemma 5.9, we have \u03ba < \u03c9 and \u03b3(\u03c8, \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c8) \u2208\n\u03b3\n\u03ba\u22121\nA. We prove by a further induction on modal fixpoint schemes \u03b4 that \u03b4(\u03c8, \u266f\u03b3 \u03c8) \u2208 A\u2191\nimplies that A |=(T\u03a3 ,\u03be) (\u03b4(\u03c8, \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c8))s . The case for the parameter variable is discharged\n\u03b3\nby the inductive hypothesis applied to \u03c8, as \u03c8 t is a proper subterm of \u03c6t , while the case\nfor the recursion variable is discharged by the inductive hypothesis applied to \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c8\n\u03b3\n(which is strictly below \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c8 w.r.t. \u0016 since \u03ba < \u03c9). The cases for Boolean operations and\nmodal operators are as in the outer induction. This finishes the inner induction, so\nthat A |=(T\u03a3 ,\u03be) \u03b3(\u03c8, \u266f\u03ba\u22121\n\u03c8) and hence A |=(T\u03a3 ,\u03be) \u266f\u03ba\u03b3 \u03c8.\n\u03b3\nFinally, the case \u03c6 = \u266d\u03b3 \u03c8 is discharged by coinduction. For timed-out \u03a3-formulas \u03c1,\nwe put T\u03a3 (\u03c1) = {A \u2208 T\u03a3 | \u03c1 \u2208 A} (this is like \u03c1\u0302 in Definition 5.10 but will be applied to\nlong expressions). As [[\u266d\u03b3 \u03c8]](T\u03a3 ,\u03be) is a greatest fixpoint, it suffices to prove that T\u03a3 (\u266d\u03b3 \u03c8)\nis semantically a postfixpoint of \u03b3(\u03c8), i.e.\nT\u03a3 (\u266d\u03b3 \u03c8) \u2286 [[\u03b3(\u03c8)]](T\u03a3 (\u266d\u03b3 \u03c8)).\n\n(4)\n\nTo begin, we prove by induction on modal fixpoint schemes \u03b4 that for all timed-out\n\u03a3-formulas \u03c7,\nT\u03a3 (\u03b4(\u03c8, \u03c7)) \u2286 [[\u03b4(\u03c8)]](T\u03a3 (\u03c7)).\n\n(5)\n\nThe cases for \u22a5, \u22a4, and the recursion variable x are clear. The case for the parameter\nvariable p is discharged by the outer inductive hypothesis applied to \u03c8. The cases for\n\u2227 and \u2228 are by Lemma 5.9; e.g., we have\nT\u03a3 ((\u03b41 \u2228 \u03b42 )(\u03c8, \u03c7))\n\u2286 T\u03a3 (\u03b41 (\u03c8, \u03c7)) \u222a T\u03a3 (\u03b42 (\u03c8, \u03c7))\n\u2286 [[\u03b42 (\u03c8)]](T\u03a3 (\u03c7)) \u222a [[\u03b41 (\u03c8)]](T\u03a3 (\u03c7))\n= [[(\u03b42 \u2228 \u03b41 )(\u03c8)]](T\u03a3 (\u03c7)).\n\n(Lemma 5.9)\n(induction)\n\nFinally, the case for modal operators is by coherence: for \u2660 being either a modal operator \u2665 \u2208 \u039b or a dual modal operator \u2665, we have\nT\u03a3 (\u2660\u03b4(\u03c8, \u03c7))\n\u2286 \u03be \u22121 [[[\u2660]]T\u03a3 (T\u03a3 (\u03b4(\u03c8, \u03c7)))]\n\u2286\u03be\n\n\u22121\n\n(coherence)\n\n[[[\u2660]]T\u03a3 ([[\u03b4(\u03c8)]]T\u03a3 (\u03c7))]\n\n(induction, monotonicity)\n\n= [[\u2660\u03b4(\u03c8)]](T\u03a3 (\u03c7)).\nBy (5), we reduce our goal (4) to\nT\u03a3 (\u266d\u03b3 \u03c6) \u2286 T\u03a3 (\u03b3(\u03c8, \u266d\u03b3 \u03c8)),\nwhich holds by Lemma 5.9.\nIn summary, we have proved completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization:\nT HEOREM 5.13 (C OMPLETENESS ). If \u0393 is admissible and R is one-step complete,\nthen the logic L\u266f is complete over finite models.\nP ROOF. We have to show that every consistent formula \u03c6 is satisfiable in a finite T coalgebra, where by Lemma 5.1 we can assume that \u03c6 is in NNF. This follows from the\npreceding lemmas by the usual pattern: Let \u03a3 be the least Fischer-Ladner closed set\nof formulas in NNF containing \u03c6. Then \u03c6 is contained in the t-image of some timed-out\n\u03a3-atom by the timed-out Lindenbaum lemma (Lemma 5.8), hence by the truth lemma\n(Lemma 5.12) satisfied in a coherent coalgebra on the set T\u03a3 of timed-out \u03a3-atoms,\nwhich exists by Lemma 5.11; the set T\u03a3 is finite by Lemma 5.8.\n25\n\n\fWe enumerate a few concrete instances of this result:\nExample 5.14. We obtain that the Kozen-Park axiomatization (in combination with\nthe modal rules and propositional reasoning) is complete for the following logics.\n(1) All admissible flat fragments of the standard relational \u03bc-calculus, interpreted\nover unrestricted, serial, or deterministic Kripke models. We thus recover the\nknown completeness results for LTL [Gabbay et al. 1980] and serial and non-serial\nCTL [Emerson and Halpern 1985], but also for logics featuring operators outside\neven CTL\u2217 as discussed in Example 2.3.1. Non-serial CTL is already covered by\nthe generic results of Santocanale and Venema [2010].\n(2) All admissible flat fragments of the graded \u03bc-calculus, including ones featuring the\noperators 'the current state is the root of a finite binary tree all whose leaves satisfy\n. . . ', '. . . holds somewhere on every infinite k + 1-ary tree starting at the current\nstate', and 'the current state is the root of a finite binary tree all whose leaves are\nat even distance from the root and satisfy . . . ' discussed in Example 2.3.2.\n(3) All admissible flat probabilistic fixpoint logics, including ones featuring linear inequalities on probabilities.\n(4) All admissible flat conditional fixpoint logics.\n(5) All admissible flat fragments of the monotone \u03bc-calculus and the serial monotone\n\u03bc-calculus, including the star-nesting-free fragments of CPDL and game logic.\n(6) All admissible flat fragments of the alternating-time \u03bc-calculus, including\nalternating-time temporal logic ATL but also logics going beyond ATL, e.g. ones\nfeaturing the operator '. . . holds in all even states along any path' discussed\nin Example 2.3.5. In fact, ATL appears to be the only example outside the\nrelational world for which a completeness result of this type was previously\nknown [Goranko and van Drimmelen 2006].\nIn most of these examples except graded and probabilistic fixpoint logics, we actually\nobtain finite axiomatizability, and locally finite axiomatizability in the case of graded\nfixpoint logics (Remark 3.9).\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have lifted the completeness theorem for flat modal fixpoint logics [Santocanale and Venema 2010] to the level of generality of coalgebraic logic.\nSpecifically, we have given a Kozen-Park style axiomatization for fixpoint operators, and we have shown this axiomatization to be sound and complete under the\nconditions that (i) the defining formulas of the fixpoint operators satisfy a mild\nsyntactic restriction, and (ii) the coalgebraic base logic is axiomatized by a onestep complete rule set. This result covers, e.g., probabilistic fixpoint logics and flat\nfragments of the monotone \u03bc-calculus, the ambient fixpoint logic of Parikh's game\nlogic [Parikh 1985] and concurrent PDL [Peleg 1987]. Further instances include\ncompleteness of flat fragments of the graded \u03bc-calculus [Kupferman et al. 2002],\nto our knowledge the first completeness result for any graded fixpoint logic, and\ncompleteness of flat fragments of the alternating-time \u03bc-calculus [Alur et al. 2002],\nwith alternating-time temporal logic (ATL) being apparently the only previously\nknown example [Goranko and van Drimmelen 2006]. In those examples that have\nfinite modal similarity type, in particular for alternating-time fixpoint logics, the\naxiomatization we obtain is finite.\nA core technical point in the proof was to show that essentially all monotone modal\noperators (including nested ones like 22, as long as the nesting depth is uniform) are\nfinitary O-adjoints in the sense of Santocanale [2008], and hence induce constructive\nfixpoint operators that can be approximated in \u03c9 steps in the Lindenbaum algebra.\n26\n\n\fThis has enabled a model construction using explicit time-outs for least fixpoint formulas in the spirit of the completeness proof for the aconjunctive fragment of the \u03bccalculus [Kozen 1983], which relies on a judicious definition of timed-out formula.\nA remaining open problem is to extend the completeness result to larger fragments\nof the coalgebraic \u03bc-calculus beyond the single variable fragment covered here, first\nand foremost the alternation-free fragment, and eventually the full coalgebraic \u03bccalculus.\nReferences\nR.
