For example, a universe with an era of contraction is also a possibility. The\npre-big-bang scenario is a realization of such a case in the superstring context.2) Unfortunately, however, the pre-big-bang scenario suffers from the singularity problem,\nwhich cannot be solved without understanding the stringy non-perturbative effects.\nOne of the remarkable features of superstring theory is the existence of extra\ndimensions. Conventionally, the extra dimensions are considered to be compactified\nto form a small compact space of the Planck scale. However, recent revolutionary\nprogress in string theory has lead to the brane-world picture.3) In this paper, we\nconsider a system of two branes having tensions of opposite sign, with the intermediate spacetime (bulk) described by an anti-de Sitter space (AdS5 ).4), 5), 6), 7) One\nof the branes is assumed to be our universe, and there exists an inflaton field that\nleads to inflation. The other brane is assumed to be vacuum, but with a non-zero\ncosmological constant (see Fig. 1).\nAssuming the slow roll of the inflaton field, we can regard both branes as vacuum\n(de Sitter) branes. Hence, we analyze this case in detail.

Kanno, M. Sasaki and J. Soda\n\nstatic de-Sitter two-brane system has been considered in the cosmological context.8)\nHowever, it is now well-known that a static de-Sitter two-brane system is unstable.9)\nWe therefore investigate the non-trivial radion dynamics and focus on its cosmological consequences (See the previous work on the radion dynamics given in Ref. 10).\nAs a result, we find a new scenario of the braneworld, which we call the \"born-again\nbraneworld scenario\". We show that the two branes can collide without developing\nserious singularities, as seen from an observer on either brane, and emerge as reborn\nbranes with the signs of the Lagrangians reversed. We find that our scenario has\nfeatures common to both the conventional inflationary scenario and the pre-big-bang\nscenario. In a sense, we can regard it as a non-singular realization of the pre-big-bang\nmodel in the braneworld context. (See related works and criticism of them presented\nin Refs. 11) and 12).) In particular, a flat spectrum for the density perturbation is\nnaturally produced, while background gravitational waves with a very blue spectrum\nare generated through the collision. It may be possible to detect this using future\ninterferometric gravitational wave detectors.13)\n\n\u03b4T\nT\n\u03c6\n\n\u03a8\nVacuum\n\nFig. 1. Radion as the distance between two branes.\n\n\u00a72.\n\nEffective action\n\nWe begin by reviewing the effective equations on a brane at low energies, which\nwe derived in previous papers14), 15) (see also Refs. 16) and 17)). This effective theory\nis valid if the energy density on a brane is much smaller than the brane tension.\nStrictly speaking, we cannot use this action when two branes collide, because the\njunction conditions lose their meaning in this case. Indeed, the collision process is\nsingular from the 5-dimensional point of view. However, this singularity is relatively\nmild, and the action is completely regular at the collision point. This leads us to\nassume that the collision process can be described by this effective action. This\nassumption is crucial for later analysis.\nOur system is described by the action\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\np\nX\n1\n12\n5 \u221a\nS = 2 d x \u2212g R + 2 \u2212\n\u03c3i d4 x \u2212gi-brane\n2\u03ba\nl\ni=A,B\n\n\fBorn-Again Braneworld\n+\n\nX Z\n\ni=A,B\ni-brane\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\nd4 x\n\np\n\n\u2212g i-brane Limatter ,\n\n3\n(2.1)\n\nand \u03ba2 are the 5-dimensional scalar curvature, the induced metwhere R,\nric on the i-brane, and the 5-dimensional gravitational constant, respectively. We\nconsider an S1 /Z2 orbifold spacetime with the two branes as the fixed points. In\nthe first Randall-Sundrum (RS1) model,4) the two flat 3-branes are embedded in\nAdS5 with the curvature radius l and the brane tensions given by \u03c3A = 6/(\u03ba2 l)\nA-brane = e2d/l g B -brane , where d is the distance\nand \u03c3B = \u22126/(\u03ba2 l). Then we have g\u03bc\u03bd\nbetween the two branes. We assume this model to be the ground state of our model.\nAdding the energy momentum tensor to each of the two branes, and allowing\ndeviations from the pure AdS5 bulk, the effective (non-local) Einstein equations on\nthe branes at low energies take the forms18), 14), 15)\n\u03ba2 A\u03bc\n2\nT \u03bd \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc \u03bd ,\n(2.2)\nl\nl\n\u03ba2\n2 \u03c7\u03bc \u03bd\nG\u03bc \u03bd (f ) = \u2212 T B\u03bc \u03bd \u2212\n.\n(2.3)\nl\nl \u03a94\nA-brane and \u03a9 is a conformal factor that relates the metric on the\nwhere h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd\nB -brane = \u03a9 2 h ), and the\nA-brane to that on the B-brane (specifically, f\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nterms proportional to \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd are 5-dimensional Weyl tensor contributions, which describe the non-local 5-dimensional effect. Although Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) are non-local\nindividually, with undetermined \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd , they can be combined so as to reduce them to\nlocal equations for each brane.

In order to study the dynamics of the radion, it is\nconvenient to move to the Einstein frame, in which the action takes the canonical\nEinstein-scalar form.19) Applying the conformal transformation defined by h\u03bc\u03bd =\n1\n\u03a8 g\u03bc\u03bd and introducing the new field\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u03a8 \u22121\n\u03b7 = \u2212 log \u221a\n,\n(3.2)\n1\u2212\u03a8 +1\nwe obtain the Einstein-frame effective action as\n\u0014\n\u0015 Z\nZ\n\u221a\nl\n3 \u03b1\n4 \u221a\nSA = 2 d x \u2212g R(g) \u2212 \u2207 \u03b7\u2207\u03b1 \u03b7 \u2212 d4 x \u2212g V (\u03b7) ,\n2\u03ba\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u2207 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd , and the\nradion potential now takes the form\nV (\u03b7) = \u03b4\u03c3 A\n\nh\n\ncosh4\n\n\u03b7\n\u03b7 i\n,\n+ \u03b2 sinh4\n2\n2\n\n\u03b2=\n\n\u03b4\u03c3 B\n.\n\u03b4\u03c3 A\n\n(3.4)\n\nWe can also start from the effective action on the B-brane to obtain the same\nEinstein-frame effective action.

The potential function for \u03b7.\n\nthe two branes are infinitely separated when \u03b7 = 0 (\u03a8 = 1), and they collide when\n\u03b7 = \u221e (\u03a8 = 0). For definiteness, let us assume \u03b4\u03c3A > 0. If \u03b4\u03c3 A + \u03b4\u03c3 B > 0,\n\n\f6\n\nS. Kanno, M. Sasaki and J. Soda\n\n\u03a8 will move towards unity; i.e., the branes will move away from each other. If\n\u03b4\u03c3 A + \u03b4\u03c3 B < 0, the potential has a maximum at \u03a8c = 1 + 1/\u03b2, and the behavior\ndepends on whether \u03a8 > \u03a8c or \u03a8 < \u03a8c . If \u03a8 > \u03a8c , the branes will become infinitely\nseparated. If \u03a8 < \u03a8c , the branes will approach each other and eventually collide.\nThe static two de-Sitter brane solution corresponds to the unstable point \u03a8 =\n\u03a8c . In fact, considering the fluctuations around \u03a8c , we find an instability characterized by the equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\nK\n2\n\u03b4\u03a8\u0308 + 3H\u03b4\u03a8\u0307 \u2212 4 H + 2 \u03b4\u03a8 = 0 .\n(3.6)\na\nWe see that the mass square, \u22124(H 2 + K/a2 ), is negative, in accordance with the\nprevious linear perturbation analysis.9)\nAs we mentioned above, in the case \u03a8 < \u03a8c , the two branes collide. From the\n5-dimensional point of view, this is certainly a singularity, where the spacetime degenerates to 4 dimensions. However, as far as observers on the branes are concerned,\nnothing seems to go wrong. In fact, the action (2.7) is well-defined even in the limit\n\u03a8 \u2192 0. Let us assume that \u03a8 smoothly becomes negative after collision. Then\nreplacing \u03a8 as \u03a8 \u2192 \u2212\u03a8\u0303 in the action (2.7), we find\n\u0014\n\u0015 Z\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\nl\n3 1\n|\u03b1\n4\n\u2212 SA = 2 d x \u2212h \u03a8\u0303 R(h) +\n\u03a8\u0303 \u03a8\u0303|\u03b1 + d4 x \u2212h(\u2212LA )\n2\u03ba\n2 1 + \u03a8\u0303\nZ\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u221a\n(3.7)\n+ d4 x \u2212h 1 + \u03a8\u0303 (\u2212LB ) .\n\nThis is the same as the effective action on the B-brane, given in Eq. (2.11), except for the overall change of sign and the associated changes of sign of the matter\nLagrangians. This fact can be interpreted as follows. After collision, the positive\ntension brane becomes a negative tension brane, together with the sign change of\nthe matter Lagrangian, and vice versa for the initially negative tension brane. This\nimplies that, if we live on either of the branes, our world transmutes into quite a\ndifferent world, and so do we without much damage to the world. That is, we are\nborn again!\nThis procedure might cause a serious problem when we consider quantum theory. A similar issue arises in string theory if there exists a negative tension brane.\nHowever, string theory has the potential ability to overcome this difficulty. For the\ntime being, we can only hope that our prescription has an appropriate interpretation\nin the context of string theory.\n\u00a74.\n\nBorn-again braneworld\n\nAfter the collision, if our world had initially been a positive tension brane, we\nwould now be on the negative tension brane. However, the theory described by the\naction (2.11) with any value of \u03a6 contradicts observation. Therefore we assume that\nwe were initially on the negative tension brane (B-brane) before the collision.\nLet us first investigate the cosmological evolution of the B-brane in the original\nJordan frame.

The evolution of the Hubble constant in the Jordan frame. The solution rapidly approaches\nthe de-Sitter spacetime. We also plotted the pre-big-bang solution in the Einstein frame.\n\nLet us analyze this collision. We denote the Hubble constant at the time of\ncollision t = tc by Hc . Applying Eq. (4.7) to the vicinity of the time of collision, we\nfind\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u221a\nH\u22172\n\u03a6 = \u22122(1 \u2212 \u03b3)Hc (t \u2212 tc ) ; \u03b3 = 1 \u2212 2 1 +\n.\n(4.11)\nHc\n\u03b2\nAs expected, \u03a6 behaves perfectly smoothly around the time of collision. The brane\n\n\fBorn-Again Braneworld\n\n9\n\ngeometry is, of course, perfectly regular as well. In fact, the Friedmann equation\n(4.6) continues to hold without a hint of collision.\nNow, we transform these quantities into the Einstein frame. Because \u03a6 \u2192 \u22121\neventually, we can regard our present universe to be described by the Einstein frame.\nThe relation between the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame is\nds2E = \u2212dt2E + b2 (tE )\u03b4ij dxi dxj\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= |\u03a6| \u2212dt2J + a(tJ )2 \u03b4ij dxi dxj ,\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere we have attached the subscripts E and J to the time coordinates to denote\nthe cosmic time in the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame, respectively. Thus we\nhave\np\np\nb = |\u03a6| a, dtE = |\u03a6| dtJ .\n(4.13)\n\nTherefore, the Hubble parameter in the Einstein frame behaves in the vicinity of\ncollision as\n1\nHc\n\u1e03(tE )\n=\n+\n\u00011/3 ,\n\u221a\nb(tE )\n3tE\n3(1 \u2212 \u03b3)Hc |tE |\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere the collision time in the Einstein frame is set to be tE = 0.\nWe note that in the Einstein frame, the universe contracts rapidly just before the\ncollision, and the Hubble parameter diverges to \u2212\u221e at collision. Then, the universe\nis reborn with an infinitely large Hubble parameter, which looks like a big-bang\nsingularity. Thus, because there exists no singularity in the Jordan frame, the prebig-bang phase and the post-big-bang phase in the Einstein frame are successfully\nconnected. That is, our scenario is indeed a successful realization of the pre-big-bang\nscenario in the context of the braneworld (see Fig. 4).\n\u00a75.\n\nObservational implication\n\nAs we can see from Eq. (4.6), the universe will rapidly converge to the quaside-Sitter regime, while the radion can vary, as long as the relation (4.7) is satisfied.\nIn the Jordan frame, because the metric couples with the radion, the non-trivial\nevolution of the radion field affects the perturbations. This possibility discriminates\nour model from the usual inflationary scenario. On the other hand, the inflaton\ndoes not couple directly with the radion field. Hence, the inflaton fluctuations are\nexpected to give adiabatic fluctuations with a flat spectrum. This feature of our\nmodel is an advantage it has over the pre-big-bang model.\n5.1. Radion fluctuations\nTo study the behavior of the radion fluctuations, it is convenient to work in the\nEinstein frame. We express the metric perturbation in the Einstein frame as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2E = b2 \u2212(1 + 2A)d\u03c4 2 + 2\u2202i Bdxi d\u03c4 + ((1 + 2R)\u03b4ij + 2\u2202i \u2202j E) dxi dxj (5.1)\n\n\f10\n\nS. Kanno, M. Sasaki and J. Soda\n\nThe action for a curvature perturbation R on the \u03b4\u03b7 = 0 (i.e., radion-comoving)\nslice reads (for a concise review, see Appendix B of Ref. 20))\nZ\ni\nh\n1\n(5.2)\nd\u03b7 d3 x z 2 R\u2032c 2 \u2212 Rc|i Rc |i ,\nS=\n2\n\nwhere H = b\u2032 /b and\n\n\u03b4\u03b7\nRc = R \u2212 H \u2032 ,\n\u03b7\n\nz=\n\nr\n\n3l b\u03b7 \u2032\n.\n2\u03ba2 H\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe equation of motion for Rc is\n(3)\nz\u2032\nR\u2032\u2032c + 2 R\u2032c \u2212 \u2206 Rc = 0 .\nz\n\n(5.4)\n\nBecause the background behaves as b \u223c (\u2212\u03c4 )1/2 , H \u223c (2\u03c4 )\u22121 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u223c (\u2212\u03c4 )\u22121 ,\nwe have z \u221d b, and the positive frequency modes for the adiabatic vacuum are given\nby\ns\nRc,k \u223c\n\n\u03c0\u03ba2\n(1)\nH0 (\u2212k\u03c4 ) ,\n6H\u2217 l\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere we have normalized b as b = |H\u2217 \u03c4 |1/2 .

If we define the spectral index\nwhere Mpl\nby P (k) \u221d kn\u22124 , this implies n = 4.\nThere are, however, a couple of points that should be mentioned. First, the\ncurvature perturbation Rc is logarithmically divergent at the instant of collision.\nThis divergence does not disappear even in the Jordan frame.\u2217) . Note that Rc is\ndefined on the hypersurface on which the radion is uniform, and hence is invariant\nunder the conformal transformation (4.13) This suggests the marginal instability of\nour system. Nevertheless, if we cut off an infinitesimally small time interval around\nthe singularity, say [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb], and smoothly match Rc at \u03c4 = \u00b1\u01eb, the result is quite\ninsensitive to the choice of \u01eb, as long as k\u01eb \u226a 1, i.e., the scale is outside the effective\nHubble horizon H\u22121 . Thus, we expect the result (5.6) to be valid for all scales of\ncosmological interest.\nThe second point, which is a possible drawback, is the following. If inflation (in\nthe Jordan frame) continues for a time of O(H\u2217\u22121 ) after collision, the blue spectrum\ngiven above should not be called \"blue\" after all. As can be seen from Fig. 4, or from\nEq. (4.14), |H| is quite symmetric around \u03c4 = 0, at least for |\u03c4 | . H\u2217\u22121 . This implies\nthat all the modes with k > H\u2217 that were once outside the horizon in the pre-bigbang phase came inside the horizon again in the post-big-bang phase by the time\n\nThe fact that the perturbation is generically singular when the effective gravitational constant\nchanges sign was first pointed out by Starobinsky.21)\n\u2217)\n\n\fBorn-Again Braneworld\n\n11\n\n\u03c4 \u223c H\u2217\u22121 . (It should be noted that the conformal time is approximately equal to the\ncosmic time in the Jordan frame near the collision, with our normalization such that\nb = |H\u2217 \u03c4 |1/2 .) Because the evolution near the collision time is approximately time\nsymmetric, the standard vacuum state will re-emerge for the modes that re-enter\nthe horizon in the Einstein frame. These modes will then come outside the horizon\nagain in the inflationary phase, and their spectrum will be a normal scale-invariant\none. Therefore, we would obtain a spectrum that is scale-invariant for k > H\u2217 and\nblue spectrum at k < H\u2217 , with the maximum amplitude given by\nR2c\n\nk=H\u2217\n\n\u223c\n\nH\u22172\n2 .\nMpl\n\n(5.7)\n\nFor the values of H\u2217 predicted by the standard inflationary models, this is not really\na blue spectrum in the observational sense.\nThis problem can be avoided only if the inflation ends right after the collision,\nwhen \u03c4 \u226a H\u2217\u22121 . One possibility is to resort to the marginal instability mentioned\nabove. There may be a model in which the marginally divergent spectrum at high\nfrequencies triggers a phase transition to end inflation. It is not clear if it is possible\nto construct such a model in a natural way. We leave investigation of this point as\na future problem.\n5.2. Gravitational waves\nNext, consider the tensor perturbations\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = b2 (\u03c4 ) \u2212d\u03c4 2 + (\u03b4ij + hij )dxi dxj ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere hij satisfy the transverse-traceless conditions hij ,j = hi i = 0. For the gravitational tensor perturbations, we have\nh\u2032\u2032k + 2Hh\u2032k + k2 hk = 0 ,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere hk is the amplitude of hij . Since H \u223c (2\u03c4 )\u22121 , hk has approximately the\nsame spectrum as Rc , including the magnitude. In particular, the spectral index\nfor the gravitational waves is also n = 4. (Here, the spectral index is defined by\nPh (k) \u221d kn\u22124 , as in the case of the scalar curvature perturbation. For the tensor\nperturbation, the conventional definition is nT = n\u22121.) Provided that inflation ends\nright after collision, as discussed in the previous subsection, this gives a sufficiently\nblue spectrum that can amplify \u03a9g by several orders of magnitude or more on small\nscales as compared to conventional inflation models. Thus, there is the possibility\nthat it may be detected by a space laser interferometer for low frequency gravitational\nwaves, such as LISA.13)\n5.3. Inflaton perturbation\nTo investigate the inflaton perturbation rigorously, one needs to introduce an\ninflaton field explicitly and consider a system of equations fully coupled with the\nradion and the metric perturbation. However, since this is beyond the scope of the\npresent paper, let us just estimate the effect of the metric perturbation induced by\nradion fluctuations on the inflaton perturbation.\n\n\f12\n\nS. Kanno, M. Sasaki and J. Soda\nThe field equation for the inflaton, \u03c6, in the Jordan frame is\na\u22122 (a2 \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 \u2206\u03b4\u03c6 + a2 \u2202\u03c62 V \u03b4\u03c6\n\n= \u22123\u03c6\u2032 R\u2032J + a\u22122 (a2 \u03c6\u2032 AJ )\u2032 \u2212 a2 \u2202\u03c6 V AJ \u2212 \u2206(EJ\u2032 \u2212 BJ )\u03c6\u2032 ,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere the suffix J indicates a quantity in the Jordan frame. Again, let us consider\nthe radion-comoving slice. Then, all the metric perturbation variables in the Jordan\nframe coincide with their respective counterparts in the Einstein frame.\nIgnoring the effect of the inflaton perturbation, the Hamiltonian and momentum\nconstraints on the radion-comoving slice are22)\n3 \u20322\n\u03b7 Ac ,\n4\nR\u2032c \u2212 HAc = 0 .\n\n\u2206(Rc \u2212 H(E \u2032 \u2212 B)c ) =\n\n(5.11)\n\nUsing these equations, Eq. (5.10) reduces to\na\u22122 (a2 \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 \u2206\u03b4\u03c6 + a2 \u2202\u03c62 V \u03b4\u03c6\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2032\n\u2032\n2H2 + H\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\nR\u2032c 2\n\u2206Rc \u2032\n\u22122\n2 Rc \u2032\n=\u2212\n\u2212\nR\n\u03c6\n+\na\n\u03c6\na \u2202\u03c6 V \u2212\n\u03c6 .\na\nc\n2\nH\nH\nH\nH\n\n(5.12)\n\nSince R\u2032c /H is finite, we see that the right-hand side of the above is regular and small\nfor the slow-roll inflation. Hence, the inflaton fluctuations are not strongly affected\nby the radion fluctuations. Thus, the inflaton fluctuations should have a standard\nscale-invariant spectrum.\n\u00a76.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a scenario in which two branes collide and are reborn\nas new branes, called the \"born-again braneworld scenario\". Our model has the\nfeatures of both inflationary and pre-big-bang scenarios. In the original frame, which\nwe call the Jordan frame, because gravity on the brane is described by a scalar-tensortype theory, the brane universe is assumed to be inflating due to an inflaton potential.\nFrom the 5-dimensional point of view, the radion, which represents the distance\nbetween the branes and which acts as a gravitational scalar on the branes, has nontrivial dynamics and these vacuum branes can collide and pass through smoothly.\nAfter collision, it is found that the positive tension and the negative tension branes\nexchange their role. Then, they move away from each other, and the radion becomes\ntrivial after a sufficient lapse of time. The gravity on the originally negative tension\nbrane (whose tension becomes positive after collision) then approaches that of the\nconventional Einstein theory, except for tiny Kaluza-Klein corrections.\nWe can also consider the cosmological evolution of the branes in the Einstein\nframe. Note that the two frames are indistinguishable at present if our universe is on\nthe positive tension brane after collision. In the Einstein frame, the brane universe\nis contracting before the collision and a singularity is encountered at the collision\npoint. This resembles the pre-big-bang scenario. Thus our scenario may be regarded\nas a non-singular realization of the pre-big-bang scenario in the braneworld context.\n\n\fBorn-Again Braneworld\n\n13\n\nBecause our braneworld is inflating, and the inflaton has essentially no coupling\nwith the radion field, an adiabatic density perturbation with a flat spectrum is\nnaturally realized. On the other hand, because the collision of branes mimics the\npre-big-bang scenario, the primordial background gravitational waves with a very\nblue spectrum may be produced. This suggests the possibility that we may be able\nto observe the collision epoch using a future gravitational wave detector, such as\nLISA.\nAdmittedly, the collision process must be treated with a more fundamental theory. However, because the singularity at the collision point is very mild, we expect\nthat the qualitative features of our scenario will remain unchanged, even if we include the effect of a (yet unknown) fundamental theory. The born-again scenario\nsurely deserves further investigation.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by Monbukagaku-sho Grant-in-Aid for Scientific\nResearch, Nos. 14540258, 1047214 and 12640269.
