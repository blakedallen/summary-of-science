Introduction\nA purely one-dimensional metal is not expected to retain the Fermi liquid properties of\nits three-dimensional counterpart, which is characterized by a one-to-one relationship of\nits excitations to those of a non-interacting Fermi system and an electron quasiparticle\nlifetime that diverges to infinity near the Fermi surface. Instead, any interaction between\nelectrons in a one-dimensional metal is expected to lead to a non-zero scattering phaseshift and to destroy completely the quasi-electron nature of the excitations [1]. The\nresulting \"Luttinger liquid\" state has separate charge and spin excitations, and quite\ndifferent transport properties from those of a Fermi liquid. The Luttinger liquid state\nis an adiabatic continuation of the ground state of a simple one-dimensional model, the\nLuttinger model [2], in much the same way that a Fermi-liquid state can be adiabatically\nderived from the ground state of noninteracting fermions.\nHow could we observe this fascinating state of matter? We cannot fabricate\npurely one-dimensional systems in the laboratory, but we can produce systems that\nare quasi-one-dimensional, to a greater or a lesser degree. In several of these, searches\nfor Luttinger liquid behaviour have been undertaken. These include charge-transfer\nsalts such as TMTSF having almost one-dimensional bandstructures [3], semiconductor\nquantum wires [4], edge states in the quantum Hall effect (which are chiral systems\nalong which electrons can only propagate in one direction) [5, 6], carbon nanotubes\n[7], and atomic-scale quantum wires fabricated by self-assembly [8] or novel SPM-based\nsurface lithographies [9, 10, 11]. The important question for a theorist is whether such a\nquasi-one-dimensional system, interacting with a three-dimensional environment, would\nbe expected to show Luttinger liquid behaviour or not, and if so, for what range of\nparameters. This question was given particular timeliness by the recent angle-resolved\nphotoemission results of Segovia et al [8], which have shown that photoemission from\nchains of Au atoms on Si(111) exhibits features which may be signatures of the spin\nand charge collective modes indicative of Luttinger liquid behaviour.\nIn this paper we begin to construct a theoretical framework within which we can\nanswer these questions. We consider the simplest possible model of such a system -\none in which the atomic wire is represented by a single-chain spinless Luttinger model,\nwith electron-electron interactions, on a lattice. The environment is represented only\nby a chain with no interactions but which is otherwise identical. Electrons can hop\nbetween the two chains by hybridization of the electron states. Such a simple system\ndoes not capture the full complexities of electron scattering with the environment, nor\ncan it represent the magnetic behaviour of a Luttinger liquid. However it provides\na relatively simple starting point, and can already be used to calculate one-particle\nspectral functions such as those probed by photoemission experiments.\nIn the following sections we explain the details of our model and our numerical\nmethods in Section 2, and then describe our results in Section 3. We find that some\naspects of the model display Luttinger liquid-like behaviour while others do not; we\nthen summarize these different properties in Section 4.\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n3\n\n2. Theoretical methods\n2.1. The Luttinger model\nWe base our numerical calculations on Haldane's Luttinger model operator method [2]\nfor a chain of spinless idealized atoms with periodic boundary conditions. The Luttinger\nmodel is characterized by a linearized dispersion relation with slope vF and a complete\nseparation of the populations of left- and right-moving particles (as in figure 1) plus\nthe inclusion of an infinity of negative energy electrons [2, 1]. The second of these\ncharacteristics makes the model exactly solvable by Haldane's bosonization method, as\nthe boson commutation relations are then exact rather than approximate. The total\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the Luttinger model. p = +1, \u22121 indicate the\npopulations of left- and right-moving fermions respectively.\n\nLuttinger model Hamiltonian can be split into three parts [1]:\n\u0124 = \u01240 + \u01242 + \u01244 .\n\u01240 represents the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian:\nX\nvF (pk \u2212 kF ) : \u0109\u2020pk \u0109pk :,\n\u01240 =\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\np,k\n\nwhere q indicates momentum and p (= \u00b11) the branch index for the left- (\u22121) and rightmoving (+1) fermions. The operator \u0109\u2020pk creates a fermion of type p with momentum k\n\n\f4\n\nDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\nand : . . . : implies normal ordering. The interaction parts of the Hamiltonian, \u01242 and\n\u01244 , are given respectively by\n2X\ng2 (q)\u03c1\u0302+ (q)\u03c1\u0302\u2212 (\u2212q),\n(3)\n\u01242 =\nL q\n1X\n\u01244 =\ng4 (q)\u03c1\u0302p (q)\u03c1\u0302p (\u2212q).\n(4)\nL p,q\nThe \u01242 term represents forward scattering between the left- and right-moving fermion\nbranches, while the \u01244 term represents forward scattering within a momentum branch.\nNote however that [\u01242 , \u01240 ] 6= 0, so \u01242 can modify the ground state by excitation of\nparticle-hole pairs, whereas \u01244 commutes with \u01240 and so cannot modify the ground\nstate.

In all of the above the limit q \u2192 0 is implied where q is not explicitly\nincluded.\nIn addition there are two further parameters related to K\u03c1 : for a spinless Luttinger\nliquid they are given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\nK\u03c1 +\n\u22122 ,\n(13)\n\u03b1=\n2\nK\u03c1\n\u03b3 = 2\u03b1.\n(14)\nThe Fermi liquid corresponds to K\u03c1 = 1 and \u03b1 = 0 and so departures from these values\ncan be used to \"measure\" the extent of non-Fermi liquid behaviour. \u03b1 is an exponent\nwhich governs the power-law dependence of all single-particle properties (for example\nthe density of states, which varies as N(E) \u2248 |E \u2212 EF |\u03b1 ), as well as other properties of\nthe system, including the d.c. resistivity, which varies as \u03c1(T ) \u2248 T 1\u2212\u03b3 [1, 12].\n2.2. Coupling two chains\nWe are now able to couple two Luttinger chains (labelled by superscript A and B)\ntogether by allowing hopping between adjacent points on each chain with matrix element\nt\u22a5 :\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u0124 coupled = \u0124 A + \u0124 B + t\u22a5\n\u03c8\u0302pA\u2020 (x)\u03c8\u0302pB (x) + \u03c8\u0302pB\u2020 (x)\u03c8\u0302pA (x) .\n(15)\nx,p\n\nOther schemes of inter-chain hopping are of course possible, and we expect that they\nwill generate similar results. We neglect any \"drag effects\" of inter-chain interactions\nthat would be generated by interaction terms analogous to \u01242 or \u01244 involving electrons\non both chains. We have the choice of using either a set of basis states generated by the\ndiagonalized boson operators b\u0302\u2020q or the non-diagonalized operators \u00e2\u2020q . We choose the\nlatter, as although this has the consequence that the ground states for a single interacting\nchain no longer consist of the relevant zero-boson basis states, it is considerably more\nconvenient computationally. \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 are fermion creation operators given in the bosonized\nform by\nh \u2020\ni\n1\n\u2020\n(16)\n\u03c8\u0302p,c\n(x) = \u221a eipkFx ei\u03c6\u0302p (x) \u00dbp,c ei\u03c6\u0302p (x) ,\nL\n\u03c6\u0302p (x) is a boson field operator given by\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n\u0010 p\u03c0x \u0011\nX\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6\u0302p (x) =\n\u03b8(pq)\nNp + i\neiqx \u00e2q ,\nL\nL|q|\nq6=0\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the subscripts p refers to the branch index (\u00b11) and c to the chain index. \u00dbp,c is a\nladder operator whose form ensures the anticommutation properties of the final fermion\noperator \u03c8\u0302p\u2020 (x) despite the commutation properties of the constituent boson operators\n\u00e2q .\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\nFigure 2. Representation of the two chains.\nincluded on just one of the chains.\n\n6\n\nElectron-electron interactions are\n\nIn order for \u00dbp,c to produce anticommuting field operators on different chains, it is\nnecessary to introduce a further phase factor into its definition, analogous to Haldane's\nphase factor \u03b6(p, Np, N\u2212p ) for ensuring anticommutation between the branches of a single\nchain. The total ladder operator component of equation (16) thus takes the form\n\u00dbp,c = \u03b6(p, Np , N\u2212p )\u03b6 \u2032(c, Nc , N\u2212c )|Np,c + 1, N\u2212p,ci,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the subscript c = \u00b11 is a chain index. The anticommutation properties originate\nin the phase factors \u03b6, which can be written as\n1\n\n\u03b6i=p,c = (\u22121)( 2 iN\u2212i ) .\n\n(19)\n\n2.3. Computational details\nThe choice of a specific form for the interactions g2 (q) and g4 (q) is arbitrary, as the\nLuttinger liquid remains completely solvable for any interaction that fulfils certain\nconditions [2]. We choose a Gaussian form for the interaction and set g2 (q) = g4 (q) =\n2\u03c0V (q) with\n\u0001\nV (q) = I exp \u22122q 2 /r\n(20)\n\nas this has the advantage that it maintains the same form in both real and momentum\nspace. Other forms, such as a screened Coulomb interaction, would also be possible. The\nparameter I can be varied to control the \"strength\" of the interaction, and r controls\nthe range of the interactions.\nOur model is completed by setting the interaction strength on chain B to zero\nbut retaining interactions on chain A. With the non-interacting chain representing the\nsurface and the interacting chain the wire, we therefore form our highly simplified model\nof an atomic wire interacting with a substrate.\nThe size of the computational Hilbert space is restricted by allowing only one boson\nin each mode. While this successfully truncates the Hilbert space to a manageable size it\ndoes not affect the low energy properties in which we are interested, as we have checked\nthat only higher energy excitations involve basis states with more than one boson in\neach mode. We also neglect the presence of the infinity of negative energy electrons,\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n7\n\ni.e. \u0109|Nelectrons = 0i = 0. However, we are still strongly limited in the size of the system\nwe can handle: the Hilbert space scales exponentially with both length of chains and\nnumber of electrons. The largest system for which we have been able to calculate with\narbitrary numbers of electrons is one with length L = 6 (i.e. 12 sites in total). In order\nto obtain both the eigenstates of the coupled system and its correlation functions we\nutilize the Lanczos method [13, 14].\n2.4. Spectral functions\nWe define the spectral function \u03c1(q, \u03c9) as\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n(21)\n\u03c1(q, \u03c9)p,c = \u2212 I GR\np,c (kF + q, \u03c9 + \u03bc) ,\n\u03c0\nwith q = kF \u2212 k, and the retarded Green's function GR\np,c defined as the double Fourier\ntransform of\n\u2020\nGR\np,c (x, t) = \u2212i\u03b8(t){h\u03c8\u0302p,c (x, t)\u03c8\u0302p,c (0, 0)i}\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the subscripts p and c again indicate branch and chain indices. It is possible\nto derive an analytic form for the spectral function of a single Luttinger liquid, either\nwith or without spin, as in references [15, 16, 17]. Whereas for a Fermi liquid we would\nexpect \u03c1(0, \u03c9) to be a delta function at the Fermi energy, the situation for a Luttinger\nliquid is quite different. Spectral weight is repelled from the Fermi surface owing to\nthe virtual particle-hole excitations generated by the inter-branch scattering term g2 ,\nresulting in a broadened peak. As q is increased the Fermi liquid spectral function will\nmerely broaden like q 2 reflecting the finite lifetime of electrons away from EF , but for a\nLuttinger liquid there is zero spectral weight within a range \u00b1v0 q of the Fermi energy.\nIn addition, the negative frequency contribution is suppressed exponentially with q, and\nfor a continuum Luttinger liquid the positive frequency contributions have a power law\ndependence. For \u03c9 > 0 this is of the form \u03b8(\u03c9 \u2212 v0 q)(\u03c9 \u2212 v0 q)\u03b3\u22121 and for \u03c9 < 0 it is of\nthe form \u03b8(\u2212\u03c9 \u2212 v0 q)(\u2212\u03c9 \u2212 v0 q)\u03b3 , with \u03b3 given by equation (14) [1].\nHowever, for our more complex system it is not easy to obtain an analytic form\nand so we resort to computational methods. We calculate the Green's function\nh\ni\u22121\nh\ni\u22121\nGR (k, k \u2032 , \u03c9) = hN|\u0109k \u03c9 \u2212 \u0124 + \u03b5N\n\u0109\u2020k\u2032 |Ni + hN|\u0109\u2020k\u2032 \u03c9 + \u0124 \u2212 \u03b5N\n\u0109k |Ni\n(23)\nusing Haydock's tridiagonal Lanczos-based procedure [13].\nIn order to ensure\nconvergence, we put \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 + i\u03b7, where \u03b7 is an imaginary component of the energy\nroughly equal to the level spacing of the system [13]. |Ni is the N-electron ground\nstate, with energy \u03b5N .\n3. Results\nIn this section we present our numerical results, concentrating on L = 6 (our largest\nsystem). The results for L = 4 are very similar, and this encourages us to believe that,\ndespite the small size of our system, finite-size effects are not dominating the results.\nAll results shown here were calculated with vF = 1.\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n8\n\n3.1. Ground and excited states\nThe ground and neutral first excited states are calculated for different values of the\ninteraction strength I as detailed above. As we have chosen the basis states for\nthe system to be those before the Bogoliubov transformation, we find that the noninteracting ground state (i.e. I = 0) consists entirely of zero-boson basis states, whereas\nall the interacting systems (I > 0) have contributions from basis states that include\nbosons on one or both chains, as these basis states are not individually eigenstates of the\ninteracting system. The contribution to the ground states from basis states containing\neither no bosons on either chain, bosons on the chain with explicit interactions only (i.e.\nchain A) and bosons on both chains are shown in figure 3.\n1\n0.1\n\nproportion of states\n\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n1e-06\n1e-07\n1e-08\n1e-09\n0\n\n0.5\n\nboth, t=0.1\nA only, t=0.1\nneither, t=0.1\nsingle chain limit, L6\n\n1\n1.5\ninteraction strength\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nboth, t=0.5\nA only, t=0.5\nneither, t=0.5\n\nFigure 3.

See text for a full explanation.\n\nThe corresponding data for the boson contributions to a single isolated Luttinger\nliquid chain with otherwise identical parameters is also shown in figure 3. This matches\nalmost exactly the contribution for the system's interacting chain (chain A) and thus\nindicates we are in a regime where the the two chains can be said to be weakly coupled\nfor both coupling strengths t\u22a5 = 0.1 and 0.5.\nThe energies of the ground and first excited states are plotted in figure 4. We see\nthat the ground state energy has a region of roughly linear dependence on I in the\nrange 0 . I . 0.5 and thereafter is rather less dependent on I. The first excited state,\nhowever, is linear in I for I . 2, at which point it becomes completely independent of I.\nThe excitation energy \u2206E for the non-interacting system is equal to 2t\u22a5 , indicating that\nfor this size of system the first excitation is one between the bonding and anti-bonding\nbands with zero net momentum change. As we increase I however, the bonding and\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n9\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\nEnergy\n\n1.5\n\n2\u03c0/L\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nInteraction strength\nGround state energy\nFirst excited energy\n\nExcitation energy \u2206E\n\nFigure 4. Energies for the ground state and neutral first excited state for the L = 6,\nN = 2, t\u22a5 = 0.1 system as a function of interaction strength I.\n\nantibonding bands distort to such an extent that eventually, at I \u2248 2.0, the lowest\nexcitation becomes not one between bands with zero net momentum, but an intra-band\none with net momentum change 2\u03c0v/L. For a Luttinger liquid, we would expect the\nvelocity v in this expression to be the Luttinger velocity v0 (as in equations (9), etc.)\nrather than the Fermi velocity vF , leading to a continued I-dependence for \u2206E. However,\nit is clear from figure 4 that this is not the case for this system: the excitation energy for\nI & 2.0 remains constant and equal to 2\u03c0vF /L = \u03c0/3. (For this system vF = 1.) This\ncan be explained as follows - as I is increased the single-chain energy levels on chain A\nincrease (since the interaction is repulsive), while those on the non-interacting chain B\nremain constant. It therefore becomes energetically preferable for the electrons to move\nto the non-interacting chain B rather than remain on the (interacting) chain A, until\nthe point is reached at which the system is predominantly populated by electrons on\nchain B. This chain is still Fermi liquid-like, thus shifting the properties of the system\nas a whole back from partially Luttinger liquid-like to Fermi liquid-like.\nThis is confirmed by an examination of the location of the electrons for both the\nground and first excited states. Figure 5 shows a plot for L = 6, N = 2, t\u22a5 = 0.1,\nshowing the chain to which the electrons \"belong\", again based on an analysis of the\ncontribution of each of the basis states forming the eigenstate. As we have only 2\nelectrons in this system, there are three possible distributions for the electrons: both on\nchain A (\"A-like\"), both on chain B (\"B-like\") or one on each chain (\"equal\").\nFirst consider the ground states. We see that for the non-interacting ground state\nthe electrons are distributed equally between the chains, and once interactions are\nswitched on we evolve continuously towards a regime where basis states with electrons\non chain A are strongly suppressed in favour of states with both electrons on chain B.\nThe situation for the excited states is however quite different. We start at I = 0\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n10\n\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\nContribution\n\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n1e-06\n1e-07\n1e-08\n\nSolid lines - ground state -:- Dashed lines - first excited state\n\n1e-09\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nInteraction strength\nA-like\n\nB-like\n\nequal\n\nA-like\n\nB-like\n\nequal\n\nFigure 5. Contributions to the ground and first excited states for the L = 6, N = 2,\nt\u22a5 = 0.1 system from electrons on each chain as a function of interaction strength I.\nSee text for a full explanation.\n\nwith a state in which, like the ground state, the electrons are equally distributed\nbetween the chains. This state is, however, 4-fold degenerate and immediately even weak\ninteractions are introduced, this degeneracy is lifted and, in what is now the lowest state,\nthe contribution from basis states with both electrons on the same chain are strongly\nsuppressed. The first excited state for small values of I may therefore be thought of\nas \"covalent\" in nature, as opposed to the \"ionic\"-like states that contribute to the\nnon-interacting state where both electrons are on the same chain. As interactions are\nincreased further, the contribution from the ionic-like states begins to return. However,\nonce we hit the point (at I = 2.0) where the nature of the excitations changes from\nzero net momentum change to \u2206k = 2\u03c0vF /L, there is once more a discontinuity in the\nplot and the electron contributions from this point match those of the ground state,\nindicating that there is no net interchain electron hopping involved in these excitations.\n3.2. Spectral functions\nResults from the calculation of the spectral function \u03c1(q = 0, \u03c9) are presented in figure\n6. There are three sources of the broadening of the peaks away from the delta function\none would expect from a Fermi liquid. The first of these is due to the finite value of the\nimaginary energy \u03b7 we have used in our calculations, leading to broadening of the peaks\ninto Lorentzians with width \u223c \u03b7. The second results from the splitting into bonding and\nanti-bonding bands due to the inter-chain coupling and is equal to 2t\u22a5 . The remaining\nbroadening, however, is due to the removal of spectral weight from the Fermi energy at\n\u03c9 = 0, and is indicative of Luttinger liquid behaviour in the coupled system.\nWe can also calculate \u03c1(q 6= 0, \u03c9) although for our extremely small system, we\nare severely restricted in available values of q. As we would expect for a Luttinger\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n6\n\n11\n\nI = 0.0\nI = 1.0\nI = 2.0\nI = 2.5\n\n5\n\n\u03c1(q,\u03c9)\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c9\n\nFigure 6.

In order to show the splitting clearly, the\nelectron and hole contributions are shown as equal in magnitude.\n\nliquid, there is a strong suppression of the hole contribution for q > 0. Owing to the\ndiscrete nature of this system, it is not possible to calculate the Luttinger parameter K\u03c1\ndirect from the slopes of the electron and hole contributions as in references [15, 16, 17].\nHowever, we can still derive a value for K\u03c1 from the separation of the electron and\nhole peaks as follows: For a non-interacting coupled chain system, the electron and hole\ncontributions to \u03c1(q = 0, \u03c9) are separated by 2t\u22a5 , whereas for a single Luttinger liquid\nthe contributions to \u03c1(q 6= 0, \u03c9) are separated by 2v0 q. We define an effective v0 in\nterms of the peak splitting \u2206\u03c9 by the relation\n\u2206\u03c9 = 2(v0eff q + t\u22a5 ).\n\n(24)\n\nThen, since we have g2 (q) = g4 (q), we can use v0eff as a measure of v0 and equate\nequations (9) and (10) to give an expression for the Luttinger parameter:\n#\n\"\neff 2\n2\n(v\n\u2212\nv\n)\n1\nF\n(25)\nK\u03c1\u22121 = e\u22122\u03c6 = eff vF + 0\nvF\nv0\n= v0eff ,\n\n(26)\n\nsince vF = 1. The results of this calculation and the corresponding values of the\nparameter \u03b1 (equation (13)) are plotted in figure 7.\n4. Conclusions\nOur calculations approach the question of whether our model exhibits Luttinger liquid\nbehaviour from several complementary directions.

We\nhave also estimated the exponents in certain power-laws characterizing the Luttinger\nliquid state.\nOur results display a certain ambiguity with regard to whether or not this system\nis a Luttinger liquid. Roughly speaking, the evidence from the bosonic nature of the\nground state, the charged excited states, and the values of the scaling parameters is\nall broadly consistent with Luttinger liquid behaviour, modified by the presence of the\nsecond chain.\nSpecifically, the one-particle spectral function is consistent with Luttinger liquid\nbehaviour. At q = 0, the total spectral function is broadened by separation of the\nelectron and hole parts-this separation is much greater than the 2t\u22a5 expected in a noninteracting two-chain system. For q 6= 0, there is additional separation of the electron\nand hole parts, consistent with the further suppression of spectral weight near the Fermi\nenergy. (For q > 0, corresponding to probing the occupancy of states with k > kF -\nsee equation (21) - the hole part of the spectral function is strongly suppressed, even\nfor relatively strong interactions.) Further support for the Luttinger liquid hypothesis\ncomes from the composition of that portion of the ground state in which bosons are\nexcited on chain A: this fraction closely tracks the fraction that would be expected in\nan isolated single-chain Luttinger liquid (Figure 3).\nMoreover, we are able to derive indirectly from \u03c1(q > 0, \u03c9) values for two Luttinger\nliquid parameters: K\u03c1 (which determines the ratio of the different velocities) and \u03b1\n(which determines the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation functions). Although\nour analysis presupposes the validity of relations characterizing the Luttinger liquid\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n13\n\nstate (equation (25)), the results are self-consistent in the sense that they show K\u03c1 < 1\nand \u03b1 > 0, i.e., departures from the Fermi-liquid values. The degree of departure from\nFermi-liquid values is, however, somewhat less than would be expected for a single-chain\nsystem with the same interaction strength (see Figure 7).\nHowever, we also have evidence that there is some residual Fermi liquid behaviour.\nThis comes principally from the distribution of charge across the two chains, as a\nfunction of interaction strength, in the ground and neutral excited states. Transfer\nof charge to the non-interacting chain at higher values of I results in the resurrection\nof a Fermi-liquid like neutral excitation spectrum (although we are still able to extract\nnon-Fermi liquid values for the Luttinger parameters for these interaction strengths, as\nexplained above).\nThis implies that while the neutral excitation spectrum undergoes a transformation\nto Fermi liquid behaviour at large I, the charged excitation spectrum does not. It\nremains to be seen how the apparent conflict between these different views on the same\nunderlying quantum state is resolved.\nFinally, it should be noted that in our system the surface is represented as metallic,\nalthough in order to achieve true one-dimensional conduction in an experiment it is\nmuch more likely that a semiconducting or insulating substrate would be employed, as\nin the work of [8]. One might expect that with a gapped substrate, the elimination\nof hybridization with substrate states at the Fermi energy would promote Luttinger\nliquid formation by comparison with the metallic case. So our finding that some aspects\nof Luttinger liquid spectral behaviour persist even in the metallic case may also have\nimplications for recent and future experiments. We plan further theoretical work on\nsemiconducting substrates. It would also be interesting to study the influence of wiresubstrate interactions other than simple hybridization on Luttinger liquid formation.\nAcknowledgments\nLKD thanks EPSRC and the National Physical Laboratory for support in the form of\na CASE studentship; AJF thanks EPSRC for the award of an Advanced Fellowship.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nVoit J, 1995 Reports on Progress in Physics 58 977\nHaldane F, 1981 Journal of Physics C 14 2585\nSchwartz A et al., 1998 Physical Review B 58 1261\nWang D et al., 2000 Physical Review Letters 85 4570\nWen X, 1990 Physical Review B 41 12,838\nChang A et al., 1996 Physical Review Letters 77 2538\nBockrath M et al., 1999 Nature 397 598\nSegovia P et al., 1999 Nature 402 504\nWatanabe S et al., 1997 Surface Science 386 340\nYajima A et al., 1999 Physical Review B 60 1456\nHitosugi T et al., 1999 Physical Review Letters 82 4034\nOgata M and Anderson P, 1993 Physical Review Letters 70 3087\nHaydock R, 1980 Solid State Physics 35 215\n\n\fDoes Luttinger liquid behaviour survive in an atomic wire on a surface?\n\n14\n\n[14] Golub G H and van Loan C F, 1996 Matrix Computations (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University\nPress), 3rd ed.\n[15] Sch\u00f6nhammer K and Meden V, 1993 Physical Review B 47 16,205\n[16] Voit J, 1993 Journal of Physics C 5 8305\n[17] Meden V and Sch\u00f6nhammer K, 1992 Physical Review B 46 15,753\n\n\f"}
