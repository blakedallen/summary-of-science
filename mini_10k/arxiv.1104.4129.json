RNA has multiple functions:\nbeyond being an information carrier it has regulatory and catalytic abilities [1]. Comprehending how RNA folds and\nwhat influences the folding process are key questions [2]. Thus, the reliable prediction of RNA structure and stability\nunder various conditions is crucial for our understanding of the functioning of RNA and nucleic acid constructs in\ngeneral [3, 4].\nThe influence of temperature and solution conditions on RNA folding stays in the interest of experimental groups.\nTraditionally the thermal melting of RNA was monitored via differential scanning calometry or UV spectroscopy for\nthe bulk ensemble [5\u20138]. More recently, single molecule pulling and unzipping experiments have been used to unveil\nthe influence of different solution conditions and even determine energy parameters [9\u201311].\nOn the theoretical side, RNA denaturation has been modeled on various levels of coarse graining. Focusing on the\nsecondary structure, namely the base pairs (bp), and omitting tertiary interactions, equilibrium folding and unfolding\nhas been modeled very successfully [12\u201322]. In the presence of a logarithmic contribution to the loop entropy, it\nhas been shown that homopolymeric RNA, where sequence effects are neglected, features a genuine phase transition,\nwhich can be induced by force or temperature [18, 21\u201323]. However, the specific sequence influences the stretching\nresponse of a molecule, which has been shown by Gerland et al. [15, 24], yet without considering the logarithmic loop\nentropy. More detailed insights can be obtained by simulations, which are numerically quite costly, though, when\ncompared to models focusing only on secondary structure. Coarse grained, Go-like simulations of short RNA hairpins\nallowed to analyze the dynamics of the folding and unfolding process [25, 26]. Ion specific effects have been studied\nby performing molecular dynamics [27] or coarse grained simulations [28\u201331]. Much less is known about the salt\ndependence of denaturation transitions of RNA.\nWhile for DNA numerous corrections of the base pairing free energies due to varying salt concentration exist, see [32]\nand references therein, analogous results for the salt dependence of RNA energy parameters are sparse [28]. However,\nmolecular biology and biotechnological applications depend on the reliable prediction of RNA stability for different\nsolution conditions.\nIn this paper we extend these previous works and develop a theory that allows to include all these effects \u2013 sequence,\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor: Physik Department, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, James-Franck-Strasse, 85748 Garching, Germany, Tel.:\n+49-89-28914337, Fax: +49-89-28914642, E-mail: einert@ph.tum.de\n\u2020 E-mail: netz@ph.tum.de\n\n\f2\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\n\nnon-nested\nbackbone bond\n\n\u2212F\n\n5'\n\nmultiloop\n\npseudoknot\n\nstack / helix\n\nterminal loop\ninternal loop\n\n3'\n\nF\n\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the secondary structure of an RNA molecule.

Neglecting tertiary interactions, we use\na recursion relation, which allows to correctly account for logarithmic and thus non-linear free energy contributions\ndue to the configurational entropy of loops [21]. To include the influence of monovalent salt on RNA stability, we\nmodel the RNA backbone as a charged polymer interacting via a Debye-H\u00fcckel potential and give heuristic formulas\nfor the modification of the loop free energy and the base pairing and stacking free energy parameters. Debye-H\u00fcckel\nis a linear theory, yet we include non-linear effects caused by counterion condensation using Manning's concept [33].\nThe backbone elasticity of single stranded RNA (ssRNA) is described by the freely jointed chain (FJC) model. Our\ndescription allows for a complete description of the behavior of RNA in the three-dimensional phase space spanned\nby temperature, salt concentration, and external stretching force. We find that for an improved description of RNA\nmelting curves one needs to include both salt effects and loop entropy. Only the combined usage of these two\ncontributions enables to predict the shift of the melting temperature (due to salt) and the cooperativity (due to\nlogarithmic loop entropy), which is illustrated in the case of tRNA-phe. As an independent check we consider the\nforce induced unfolding of the P5ab RNA hairpin and observe good agreement with experimental values with no\nfitting parameters. The influence of salt is illustrated by melting curves and force extension curves for various salt\nconcentrations. For the P5ab hairpin the phase diagram is determined and slices through the three-dimensional\nparameter space are shown.\nII.\n\nFREE ENERGY PARAMETERIZATION\n\nRNA folding can be separated into three steps, which occur subsequently and do not influence each other to a\nfairly good approximation [34]. The primary structure of RNA is the mere sequence of its four bases cytosine (C),\nguanine (G), adenine (A), and uracil (U). Due to base pairing, i. e. either the specific interaction of C with G or the\ninteraction of A with U, the secondary structure is formed. Therefore, on an abstract level, the secondary structure\nis given by the list of all base pairs present in the molecule. Only after the secondary structure has formed, tertiary\ncontacts arise. Pseudoknots [35, 36], helix stacking, and base triples [37] as well as the overall three-dimensional\narrangement of the molecule are considered as parts of the tertiary structure. The main assumption of hierarchical\nfolding is, that tertiary structure formation operates only on already existing secondary structure elements [34].\nAlthough cases are known where this approximation breaks down, it generally constitutes a valid starting point [38].\nIn this paper, where the main point is the influence of the loop entropy and the salt concentration on the secondary\nstructure, we therefore neglect tertiary interactions altogether.\nGiven a set of base pairs, the secondary structure consists of helices and loops as the basic structural units, cf. fig. 1.\nSince pseudoknots are neglected, every nucleotide can be attributed unambiguously to exactly one subunit. The free\nenergy of a certain secondary structure is then given by the sum of the free energy contributions of the individual\nstructural subunits, as we will detail now.\n\n\f3\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\nA.\n\nFree energy of a loop\n\nWe model the free energy of a loop consisting of m backbone bonds, see fig. 1, with\nGl (m) = Glconf (m) + Glsalt (m) + Glinit .\n\n(1)\n\nThe first term is the loop entropy difference between an unconstrained polymer and a ring-like polymer, which is\ncharacterized by the loop exponent c [21, 23, 39, 40]\nGlconf (m) = \u2212kB T ln m\u2212c ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith kB the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature. The loop exponent c is cideal = 3/2 for an ideal\npolymer and cSAW = 1.76 for an isolated self avoiding loop. Helices emerging from the loop limit the configurational\nspace available to the loop and hence increase c. One obtains c1 = 2.06 for terminal, c2 = 2.14 for internal loops and\nc4 = 2.16 for a loop with four emerging helices [21]. Since the differences between these exponent values are quite\nsmall, we assume a constant loop exponent c = 2.1 in this paper and only compare with the case of vanishing loop\nentropy characterized by c = 0.\nThe second term in eq. (1) describes the free energy difference between a charged ring of length mlss and a straight\nrod of the same length due to electrostatic interactions, with lss = 6.4 \u00c5 the length of one ssRNA backbone bond [30].\nThe electrostatics are modeled on the Debye-H\u00fcckel level [41]\n\"\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u00132 !\n\u03bamlss\n\u03bamlss\n1\nsalt\n2\n,\nGl (m) = kB T lB (mlss )\u03c4ss ln(\u03bamlss ) \u2212 ln(\u03c0/2) + \u03b3 \u2212\n1 F2 1/2,\n3/2\n2\n2\u03c0\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012 \u0013 3/2 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u03bamlss \uf8f8\n1 \u03bamlss\n1 \uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n, 3/2 ,\n+\n2 F3\n1\n2\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\n#\n1\n+\n(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bamlss ) + \u03bamlss \u0393(0, \u03bamlss )) ,\n(3)\n\u03bamlss\np\nwith lB = e20 /(kB T 4\u03c0\u03b50 \u03b5r ) the Bjerrum length, which in water has a value of roughly 7 \u00c5, \u03ba\u22121 = \u03b50 \u03b5r kB T /(2NA e20 I)\nthe Debye screening length, \u03b50 the vacuum dielectric constant, \u03b5r \u2248 80 the relative dielectric constant of water [42],\nI = 1/2(\u03c1a za2 + \u03c1c zc2 ) the ionic strength, \u03c1a /\u03c1c and za /zc the concentration and the valency of the anions/cations, NA\nthe Avogadro constant, e0 the elementary charge, \u03b3 \u2248 0.58 Euler's constant, \u0393(a, x) the incomplete gamma function,\nand p Fq the generalized hypergeometric functions [43]. To account for modifications of the line charge density \u03c4ss due\nto non-linear electrostatic effects, we employ Manning's counterion condensation theory [33], predicting\n\u03c4ss = min(1/lss , 1/(lB zc )) .\n\n(4)\n\nEq. (3) amounts to a ground state approximation of the electrostatic contribution to the free energy of a loop. This is\nrationalized by the fact that the electrostatic interaction is screened and decays exponentially over the Debye length,\nwhich is roughly \u03ba\u22121 = 1 nm for 100 mM salt solution. However, typical distances between bases in a loop are of\nthe order of the helix diameter d = 2 nm or larger. Therefore, we expect electrostatic interactions to be basically\nindependent of the global configuration of a loop, which justifies both the ground state approximation and our\nadditivity approximation, where ion effects and conformational contributions decouple, see eq. (1). In the supporting\nmaterial, see eq. S4, we give an interpolation formula for eq. (3) involving no hypergeometrical functions.\nThe last term in eq. (1) is the loop initiation free energy Glinit . As we are employing a logarithmic loop entropy,\neq. (2), we cannot use the standard value for Glinit , which was extracted from experimental data for a different loop\nparameterization [5, 6]. Therefore, a modified value Glinit is obtained by fitting Gl (m), given by eq. (1), to experimental\ndata using c = 2.1 in Glconf (m) and the salt concentration \u03c1 = 1 M in Glsalt (m), see fig. 2a. In this figure we show\nexperimentally determined free energies for terminal, internal and bulge loops as a function of the loop size, which\nexhibit a dependence on the type of the loop. As an approximation, we do not distinguish between those loop types\nin the theory and consequently fit a single parameter Glinit to the data, which turns out to be Glinit = 1.9 kcal/mol for\nT = 300 K, see supporting material section C. In fig. 2a the fitted Gl (m) for the loop exponent c = 2.1 is depicted\nby the solid line; the other lines illustrate the effect of different loop exponents on the loop free energy according to\neq.

Symbols denote experimental values for various types of loops (hairpin, bulge,\ninternal) [30, 44] for \u03c1 = 1 M NaCl. Glinit is obtained by fitting Gl (m), eq. (1), to the experimental data for c = 2.1 and \u03c1 = 1 M.\nThe same salt concentration and the same value for Glinit is used for plotting the curves with c = 0, 1.5. (b) Salt dependence\nof the free energy of loops as a function of the number of segments m for different salt concentrations \u03c1 = 1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M\nand loop exponent c = 2.1 according to eq. (1).\n\nB.\n\nFree energy of a helix\n\nThe free energy of a helix\nGh = Ghstack + Ghinit + Ghterm + Ghsalt\n\n(5)\n\ndepends on the sequence {bi }, which consists of the four nucleotides bi = C, G, A, U. The stacking free energy Ghstack\nis based on experimentally determined parameters incorporating the base pairing free energy as well as the stacking\nfree energy between neighboring base pairs. In the standard notation, ghstack [(bi , bj ), (bi+1 , bj\u22121 )] is the contribution\nof the two neighboring, stacked base pairs (bi , bj ) and (bi+1 , bj\u22121 ) to Ghstack . The explicit values for the enthalpic and\nentropic parts are given in the supporting material. We use the expanded nearest neighbor model [5, 6] to calculate\nthe base pairing and stacking contributions of a helical section ranging from base pair (i, j) through (i + h, j \u2212 h) and\nobtain\nGhstack =\n\nh\nX\n\nh0 =1\n\nghstack [(bi+h0 \u22121 , bj\u2212h0 +1 ), (bi+h0 , bj\u2212h0 )] .\n\n(6)\n\nThe initiation and termination free energies in eq. (5) take into account weaker pairing energies of AU or GU base\npairs at the ends of the helix. We use the standard literature values for Ghinit and Ghterm [5, 6] and summarize the\nexplicit values in the supporting material. Increasing the salt concentration increases the stability of a helix: First,\ncounterions condense on the negatively charged backbone and reduce the electrostatic repulsion and, second, the\ndiffuse counterion cloud surrounding the charged molecule screens the interaction. We model the two strands of a\nhelix as two parallel rods at distance d = 2 nm interacting via a Debye-H\u00fcckel potential characterized by the screening\nlength \u03ba\u22121 . The electrostatic interaction energy per nucleotide with the other strand is given by\n\u221a\nZ \u221e\nexp(\u2212\u03ba d2 + z 2 )\n2\n2\n\u221a\ndz = 2kB T \u03c4ds\nlds lB K0 (\u03bad) .\n(7)\nghDH (\u03c1) = kB T \u03c4ds\nlds lB\n2 + z2\nd\n\u2212\u221e\nlds = 3.4 \u00c5 is the helical rise per base pair of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and K0 (\u03bad) is the zeroth order modified\nBessel function of the second kind. Again, we employ Manning's theory [33] to calculate the line charge density \u03c4ds =\nmin(1/lds , 1/(lB zc )). The reference state for the salt correction of the pairing free energy is at temperature T = 300 K\nwith monovalent salt concentration \u03c1 = 1 M, as the experimental pairing free energies ghstack were determined at this\nconcentration. The free energy shift for a helix consisting of h base pairs due to electrostatic interactions is then\nGhsalt = h(ghDH (\u03c1) \u2212 ghDH (1 M)) .\n\n(8)\n\nThe use of Debye-H\u00fcckel theory to incorporate salt effects enables to include the overall dependence on temperature\nand salt concentration but involves several approximations. First, we are using Manning's counterion condensation\n\n\f5\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\n\ntheory to obtain the actual line charge density of ssRNA and dsRNA [33]. However, Manning condensation is\nknown to underestimate the line charge at increasing salt concentration and therefore favors the bound state [45].\nSecond, when calculating the electrostatic energy of a loop we effectively use a ground state approximation and\nneglect conformational fluctuation effects. Third, when two ssRNA strands come together to form a helix, the line\ncharge density increases since the distance between two bases decreases. The salt dependence of the work to decrease\nthe axial distance between two bases from lss = 6.4 \u00c5 to lds = 3.4 \u00c5 is neglected. This approximation favors the\nunbound state. Therefore, it is very important to validate the model we employ, which we do by detailed comparison\nwith experimental data. From the favorable comparison with experiments we tentatively conclude that the various\nerrors partially cancel and the resulting expression for the salt influence is quite accurate. We point out that after\ndetermining Glinit in eq. (1), no further fitting is done and only standard literature values are used.\nOur theory is able to consider variations of the salt concentration as well as of the temperature, which makes it\nsuitable to study RNA melting at various salt concentrations in a consistent way. However, since our approach is\nsolely based on mean field theory, it will become unreliable in the case of multivalent ions, where correlations become\nimportant. Also, ion specific effects, which are important for divalent ions such as Mg2+ [46], are not considered in\nour approach.\nC.\n\nResponse of the molecule to an external stretching force\n\nIn atomic force microscope or optical tweezers experiments, it is possible to apply a stretching force F to the two\nterminal bases of the molecule. We model the stretching response of the M non-nested backbone bonds, see fig. 1,\nwith the freely jointed chain (FJC) model [15, 17, 24]. A non-nested bond is defined as a backbone bond, which is\nneither part of a helix nor part of a loop. It is outside all secondary structure elements and therefore contributes to\nthe end-to-end extension observed in force spectroscopy experiments. The force dependent contribution to the free\nenergy per non-nested monomer is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nsinh(\u03b2bss F )\nlss\nFJC\nFJC\ngf\n= Gf /M = \u2212kB T\nln\n,\n(9)\nbss\n\u03b2bss F\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ) is the inverse thermal energy and bss = 1.9 nm is the Kuhn length of ssRNA [17] (we used the\nKuhn length of ssDNA as the corresponding ssRNA data is less certain). The stretching response of one non-nested\nmonomer to an external force is then given by\nxFJC (F ) = \u2212\n\ndgfFJC\n= lss L(\u03b2F bss ) = lss (coth(\u03b2F bss ) + 1/(\u03b2F bss )) ,\ndF\n\n(10)\n\nL is the Langevin function. Electrostatic effects on the stretching response are considered to be small and hence are\nneglected [47, 48].\nIII.\n\nCALCULATION OF THE PARTITION FUNCTION\n\nSo far we showed how to calculate the free energy of one given secondary structure. The next step is to enumerate\nall possible secondary structures and to obtain the partition function, which allows to study the thermodynamics of\nthe system. As we neglect tertiary contacts \u2013 and in particular pseudoknots \u2013 for any two base pairs (i, j) and (k, l)\nwith i < j, k < l, and i < k we have either i < k < l < j or i < j < k < l. This allows to derive a recursion\nrelation for the partition function of the secondary structure. In our notation, the canonical partition function QM\ni,j of\na sub-strand from base i at the 5'-end through j at the 3'-end depends on the number of non-nested backbone bonds\nM [16, 21, 23], see fig. 1. The recursion relations for QM\ni,j can be written as\n+1\nQM\ni,j+1 =\n\nand\n\n\uf8ee\n\nvf (M + 1) \uf8f0 M\nQi,j +\nvf (M )\n\nj\u2212Nloop\n\nX\n\nk=i+M +1\n\n0\n\uf8fb\nQM\ni,k\u22121 Qk,j+1\n\n(j\u2212k\u2212Nloop )/2\n\nQ0k,j+1 =\n\nX\n\nh=1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n(k,j+1)\n\nexp[\u2212\u03b2Gh (k+h,j+1\u2212h) ]\n\nj\u2212k\u22121\u22122h\nX\nm=1\n\n(11a)\n\nQm\nk+1+h,j\u2212h\n\nexp[\u2212\u03b2Gl (m + 2)]\n.\nvf (m)\n\n(11b)\n\n\f6\n\nHeat capacity C / (kcal/(mol K))\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\n3`\n5`\n\nrS\n\n10\n\nrS\n\n0 rS bC rS bC rS bC rS bC rS bC rS bC\n280\n\nrS\n\nrS\n\nrS\n\nrS\n\nrS\n\nrS rS rS\nSr rS\n\nbC\n\nrS\nrS\nbC bC\nrS bC Sr Cb Cb bC bC bC bC bC bC bC\n\nbC bC\n\n300\n\nrS\n\nbC\n\nbC\nbC\n\nrS\n\nbC\nrS\n\nrS\n\nrS bC\n\nbC\n\nrS\n\nbC\n\nbC\n\nbC\n\nbC\n\nbC\nrS\nbC\n\nrS\n\nbC\n\nbC\n\nrS\n\nbC\n\nbC\n\n320\n\nbC\nrS\n\nc = 2.1, \u03c1 = 1 M\nc = 2.1, \u03c1 = 0.15 M\nc = 2.1, \u03c1 = 0.02 M\nc = 0, \u03c1 = 0.15 M\nVienna, \u03c1 = 1 M\nbC\nexp. \u03c1 = 0.15 M\nbC\nrS\nexp. \u03c1 = 0.02 M\nbC\n\nbC\n\nbC\nrS\nrS\n\n5\n\nbC bC\nbC\n\nSr rS Sr\n\nrS\nrS\n\nrS\nrS\n\nrS\n\nbC\nbC\n\nbC\n\nrS\nrS\n\nrS\nrS\n\nrS\nrS\n\nrS\nrS\n\nrS\n\nbC\nbC\n\nrS\n\n340\n\nrS\n\nbC\nbC\n\nbC Cb\nCb bC\nbC\n\nbC\n\nbC\nbC\nbC\nbC\nbC\nCb\nrS rS\nCb bC\nrS Sr\nCb Cb\nSr rS\nbC Cb bC\nrS Sr Sr rS rS rS rS\nrS Sr rS rS Sr rS Sr rS Cb Sr bC rS\n\n360\n\nTemperature T\n\nFigure 3: Melting curve of the 76 bases long tRNA-phe of yeast; the minimum free energy structure at \u03c1 = 1 M, T = 300 K,\nc = 2.1 is shown as an inset. Symbols denote experimental melting curves for NaCl concentrations \u03c1 = 20 mM (squares)\nand 150 mM (circles) [7]. Our predictions for different salt concentrations are depicted by the dashed (20 mM), dash-dotted\n(150 mM), and solid (1 M) lines. The respective arrows indicate melting temperatures obtained by experiments of another\ngroup [8] at the same salt concentration \u03c1 = 150 mM (left arrow) and \u03c1 = 1 M (right arrow). The dotted line shows our\nprediction for \u03c1 = 150 mM and c = 0 and exemplifies that a non-zero loop exponent is responsible for rendering the transition\nmore cooperative, in closer agreement with experiment; for 150 mM and c = 0 the melting temperature is at higher temperatures\nsince the energy parameters are optimized for c = 2.1. The gray dash-dotted curve is the prediction of the Vienna package,\nwhich uses a linearized multi-loop entropy corresponding to c = 0 and \u03c1 = 1 M. This is to be compared to our prediction for\nc = 2.1 and \u03c1 = 1 M: while the melting temperatures are similar, the cooperativity, i. e. the widths of the peaks are different\ndue to different loop exponents.\n\nEq. (11a) describes elongation of an RNA structure by either adding an unpaired base (first term) or by adding an\narbitrary sub-strand Q0k,j+1 that is terminated by a helix. Eq. (11b) constructs Q0k,j+1 by closing structures with m\nnon-nested bonds, summed up in Qm\nk+1+h,j\u2212h , by a helix of length h. Nloop = 3 is the minimum number of bases in a\nterminal loop. vf (M ) denotes the number of configurations of a free chain with M links and drops out by introducing\nM\nthe rescaled partition function Q\u0303M\ni,j = Qi,j /vf (M ) and will not be considered further since its effects on the partition\n(k,j+1)\n\nfunction are negligible. Gh (k+h,j+1\u2212h) is the free energy of a helix beginning with base pair (k, j + 1) and ending with\nbase pair (k + h, j + 1 \u2212 h) according to eq. (5). Gl (m + 2) is the free energy of a loop consisting of m + 2 segments\nas given by eq. (1). Gl and Gh contain all interactions discussed in the previous section. Eq. (11) allows to compute\nthe partition function in polynomial time (O(N 4 )). Further, our formulation allows to treat non-linear functions for\nGl (m) and Gh (h); for instance, Gl (m) is strongly non-linear by virtue of eqs. (2) and (3).\nThe unrestricted partition function of the entire RNA, where the number of non-nested backbone bonds M is\nallowed to fluctuate, is given by\nZN =\n\nN\nX\n\nexp[\u2212\u03b2gfFJC M ]Q\u0303M\n0,N\n\n(12)\n\nM =0\n\nand contains the influence of force via gfFJC defined in eq. (9). The partition function ZN contains all secondary\nstructure interactions, but neglects pseudoknots and other tertiary interactions. As has been argued before, this\napproximation is known to work very well [34] and yields reliable predictions for the stability of nucleic acids [49].\nUsing the same ideas, we determine the minimum free energy (mfe) and the mfe structure. The mfe structure, is\ndefined as the secondary structure, which gives the largest contribution to the partition function. Since it cannot be\nderived from the partition function itself, it has to be determined from a slightly modified set of recursion relations,\nsee supporting material.\nIV.\n\nSALT DEPENDENCE OF MELTING CURVES\n\nIn this section we calculate melting curves for different salt concentrations by applying eqs. (1) and (5), which\ninclude our salt dependent free energy parameterization. In fig. 3 we compare experimental results [7, 8] with our\npredictions for the heat capacity of yeast tRNA-phe; the sequence is given in the supporting material section D. The\n\n\fRNA folding including loops and salt\n\n7\n\nheat capacity is readily obtained by\nC=T\n\n\u2202 2 kB T ln ZN\n,\n\u2202T 2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere ZN is the unrestricted partition function of the RNA at zero force, eq. (12). In all our calculations, we use\nthe same literature parameter set for the stacking and pairing free energy ghstack . No additional fit parameter enters\nexcept the loop initialization free energy Glinit , which is determined in fig. 2a from a separate experimental data set.\nThe salt dependence of the experimentally observed melting temperatures is reproduced well, compare fig. 3. The\narrows indicate additional experimental results [8] for the melting temperature for \u03c1 = 150 mM and 1 M, which again\ncoincide with our prediction. We also plot a calculated melting curve for loop exponent c = 0 and NaCl concentration\n\u03c1 = 150 mM, which exhibits a far less cooperative transition than observed in the corresponding curve with c = 2.1.\nFinally, we compare our prediction for \u03c1 = 1 M and c = 2.1 with the prediction of RNAheat in the Vienna Package [50]\nfor \u03c1 = 1M, which uses a linearized multi-loop entropy amounting to c = 0 in our framework. The predicted melting\ntemperatures are almost identical. However, the widths of the peaks in both melting curves differ and our melting\nprofile for c = 2.1 is more peaked. Taking all these observations together leads to the conclusion that only a combined\nuse of logarithmic loop entropy (characterized by a non-zero loop exponent) and salt dependent free energy corrections\nleads to a correct prediction of melting curves. The additional features in the experimental data, e. g. the shoulder\nat lower temperatures and the increased width of the experimental curves might be attributed to tertiary structure\nrearrangements, which are not captured by our approach, or to melting occurring in multiple stages.\nV.\n\nSALT DEPENDENCE OF STRETCHING CURVES\n\nApart from temperature, force is an important variable to study denaturation of RNA molecules [9, 15, 17, 23, 25, 51\u2013\n57]. In fig. 4 we show the salt dependence of stretching curves for yeast tRNA-phe. The stretching curves have been\nobtained by describing the force response of the M non-nested backbone bonds, see fig. 1, with the freely jointed\nchain (FJC) model, see eq. (10),\nx(F ) = kB T\n\n\u2202 ln ZN\n\u2202 ln ZN \u2202gfFJC\n= kB T\n= M xFJC (F ) ,\n\u2202F\n\u2202gfFJC \u2202F\n\n(14)\n\nwhere we used the expectation value of the number of non-nested backbone segments\nM = \u2212kB T\n\n\u2202 ln ZN\n.\n\u2202gfFJC\n\n(15)\n\nAs for the melting curves, one observes that increasing salt concentration stabilizes the structure, leading to higher\nunfolding forces. All curves converge in the large force limit to a freely jointed chain of the length of the whole RNA\nmolecule (N \u2212 1)lss , where N = 76 is the number of bases in the chain. The deviation for small forces from this\ntheoretical prediction is due to the secondary structure of RNA, which is present at small forces and which becomes\ndisrupted at forces F & 3-7 pN. In fig. 5a we show the force extension curve of the P5ab hairpin [9]; the sequence is\ngiven in the supporting material section D. Apart from the salt dependence of the force extension curve, one observes\nthat the unzipping of the helix occurs in two stages. This is seen best by considering the fraction of non-nested\nsegments and its derivative, fig. 5b. The first stage is a smooth unzipping of the first three base pairs up to the bulge\nloop visible as a shoulder at F \u2248 8pN in the derivative. The second stage is a sharp transition, where the rest of\nthe hairpin unzips. In fig. 5c we show mfe predictions for the secondary structure at different forces for \u03c1 = 1 M\nNaCl. For F < 5 pN, we predict correctly the experimentally observed native state with all base pairs intact [9]. For\nforces F \u2248 8 pN, an intermediate state appears, where the first three base pairs are unzipped up to the bulge loop.\nDenaturation is observed for F & 14 pN. The native structure of the P5ab hairpin contains the stacked pairs GG\nAA\n\u2013 bp(17,42) and bp(18,41) [9]. For this stack, no free energy parameters are available and we use the parameters for the\nstack GG\nUU , instead. However, other parameterizations for this stack work equally well and reproduce the experimental\ntransition force within errors, see fig. 6.\nVI.\n\nPHASE DIAGRAMS OF RNA HAIRPIN P5AB\n\nWith the tools established in the previous sections, we are now able to study phase diagrams of RNA. We consider\nthe P5ab hairpin, which is a well studied system [9, 24, 25, 58, 59]. In fig. 7b the phase diagram in the F -\u03c1 plane is\n\n\f8\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\n20\n\nForce F / pN\n\n15\nForce F / pN\n\n101\n\n\u03c1=1M\n\u03c1 = 0.15 M\n\u03c1 = 0.02 M\nfreely jointed chain\n\n10\n\n\u03c1=1M\n\u03c1 = 0.15 M\n\u03c1 = 0.02 M\nfreely jointed chain\n\n100\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n10-1\n10-2\n\n40\n\nExtension x / nm\n\n(a)\n\n10-1\n\n(b)\n\n100\nExtension x / nm\n\n101\n\nFigure 4: Salt dependence of stretching curves of tRNA-phe for different salt concentrations \u03c1 = 20 mM, 150 mM, 1 M.\nIncreasing salt concentration stabilizes the secondary structure due to screening of the electrostatic interaction. The dotted\nline is the theoretical prediction for the force extension curve of a freely jointed chain, eq. (10). The deviation of the predicted\ncurves for RNA from the FJC curve is due to the presence of secondary structure. The observed plateau force is due to the\nrupture of the secondary structure. We show the force extension curves in (a) a linear plot and (b) a double logarithmic plot,\nindicating that the force extension curve is linear in the low-force regime, before the secondary structure is ruptured apart.\n20\n\n10\n\ndM/(N dF )/pN\u22121\n\nM/N\n\n15\nForce F / pN\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c1=1M\n\u03c1 = 0.15 M\n\u03c1 = 0.02 M\nfreely jointed chain\n\n0.5\n\n5\n0\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\nExtension x / nm\n\n0\n\n30\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n1\nF < 5 pN\n\nF \u2248 8 pN\n0\n\n5\n\nF / pN\n\n15\n\n5\n\n\u03c1=1M\n\u03c1 = 0.15 M\n\u03c1 = 0.02 M\n10\n\nForce F / pN\n\nF > 14 pN\n\n15\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5: (a) Salt dependence of stretching curves of the 56 bases long RNA hairpin P5ab [9] for different salt concentrations\n\u03c1 = 20 mM, 150 mM, 1 M.

(b) The fraction of non-nested segments M/N\nas a function of force. One observes that the unzipping of the hairpin occurs in two stages, which is visible as a shoulder for\n5 pN . F . 6 \u2212 10 pN (exact values depend on the salt concentration) and a successive cooperative transition. The inset\nshows the derivative dM/(N dF ) for \u03c1 = 1 M, where the first transition is visible as a shoulder at F \u2248 8 pN. The sharp peak at\nF = 11 pN is the rupture of the complete helix. (c) Predicted minimum free energy structures of the hairpin P5ab at different\nforces, see also the supporting material section A. For F < 5 pN the hairpin is in the native state with all base pairs intact.\nAt F \u2248 8 pN the first helix, consisting of three base pairs and bounded by the bulge loop, is ruptured. This causes the first\nsmooth transition. Forces F & 14 pN lead to the unzipping of the whole hairpin in a very cooperative fashion.\n\nshown for T = 298 K, 300 K, 320 K and c = 2.1. The phase boundary is defined as the force where half of the helical\nsection is unzipped. For the definition of the phase boundary, we exclude the three unpaired bases at the 5'- and\nthe four bases at the 3'-end, see fig. 5c, and use the condition M \u2212 7 = (N \u2212 7)/2. This threshold value of M/N is\ndepicted by an arrow in fig. 7a. Below the phase boundary, the hairpin is stable, above the molecule is denatured.\nIn fig. 9b we additionally include the experimental results by Liphardt et al. [9] agreeing nicely with our results. It\nis important to note, that this transition is not a phase transition in the strict statistical mechanics sense, but just\na crossover. A true phase transition is defined as a non-analyticity of the free energy, which can only occur for an\ninfinite system with long-range interactions [21]. The three-dimensional phase space we are considering is spanned by\ntemperature, force, and salt concentration. In figs. 8 and 9 we show slices in the F -T and in the T -\u03c1 plane. The phase\nboundary for the F -T plane is determined the same way as in the F -\u03c1 plane, yet with varying temperature and fixed\nsalt concentration.

[9]\nand coincides with our prediction.\n\nthe phase diagrams in figs. 7, 8 on the one hand and fig. 9 on the other hand may arise.\nWe observe that for large salt concentrations, the denaturation forces and temperatures are rather independent of\nthe salt concentration, see figs. 7 and 9. Only when the Debye screening length \u03ba\u22121 is of the order of the typical\nlength scale of RNA, which is the case for \u03c1 . 100 mM, a marked dependence on the salt concentration is observed.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe construct a theory for RNA folding and melting that includes the effects of monovalent salt, loop entropy, and\nstretching forces. Our theory is based on salt and temperature dependent modifications of the free energies of RNA\nhelices and loops that include electrostatic interactions on the linear Debye-H\u00fcckel level \u2013 augmented by Manning\ncondensation \u2013 and conformational fluctuation effects via the asymptotic, non-linear expression for the entropy of\nloop formation. Decreasing salt concentration is shown to generally destabilize RNA folds and to lower denaturation\n\n\f10\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\n\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n0.5\n\n= 290 K\n= 298 K\n= 310 K\n= 320 K\n= 330 K\n= 340 K\n= 350 K\n= 360 K\n= 370 K\n= 380 K\n\n15\nbC\n\nForce F / pN\n\nM/N\n\n1.0\n\nunfolded\n\n10\n\n5\nbC\n\n0\n280\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nForce F / pN\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c1=1M\n\u03c1 = 0.25 M\n\u03c1 = 0.15 M hairpin\n\u03c1 = 0.02 M\n\u03c1 = 0.25 M (experiment)\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\n\nTemperature T / K\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n50\n\n\u03c1=1M\n\u03c1 = 0.75 M\n\u03c1 = 0.50 M\n\u03c1 = 0.25 M\n\u03c1 = 0.15 M\n\u03c1 = 0.10 M\n\u03c1 = 0.05 M\n\u03c1 = 0.02 M\n\u03c1 = 0.01 M\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n330\n\n365\nTemperature T / K\n\nHeat capacity C / (kcal/(mol K))\n\nFigure 8: (a) Fraction of non-nested segments of the P5ab hairpin as a function of force for different temperatures and constant\nsalt concentration \u03c1 = 250 mM.

The predictions are in good agreement with experimental data as shown for two different\nscenarios, namely the heat capacity curves for the thermal denaturation of tRNA-phe and the response of the P5ab\nRNA hairpin to an external pulling force.\nDue to the usage of the linear Debye-H\u00fcckel approximation in conjunction with the Manning condensation concept,\nour approach is limited to monovalent salt and neglects ion-specific effects. Electrostatic nonlinear and correlation\neffects could in principle be taken into account by more advanced modeling using variational approaches [45], while\nion-specific effects could be straightforwardly included using effective interactions between different ions and RNA\nbases [60]. More complex phenomena involving multivalent ions such as Mg2+ could in principle be modeled by\nallowing for a few tertiary contacts, which is left for future studies.\nWe find that for a proper description of RNA melting curves, correct modeling of the loop entropy is crucial. A\nnon-zero loop exponent leads to an increased cooperativity of the melting transition and thus makes the heat capacity\ncurve narrower in good agreement with experimental results. We conclude that for a correct description of RNA\ndenaturation thermodynamics, both loop entropy and salt effects are important and should be included in standard\nstructure and melting curve prediction software.\n\n\f11\n\nRNA folding including loops and salt\nVIII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nFinancial support comes from the DFG via grant NE 810/7.

(11). From the partition function QM\ni,j the free energy of an RNA\nstrand ranging from base i through j with M non-nested backbone bonds can be calculated\nM\nFi,j\n= \u2212kB T ln QM\ni,j .\n\n(S1)\n\nAnother important quantity is the minimum free energy E (mfe) associated with the ground state structure, also\ncalled mfe structure. In analogy to the partition function we define the mfe of a substrand ranging from base i through\nM\nj with M non-nested backbone segments as Ei,j\n. RNA structure prediction relies on the assumption that the native \u2013\nexperimentally observed \u2013 structure is given by the mfe structure. Following the same idea of the recursive calculation\nof the partition function, see eq. (11), we can determine the minimum free energy of a sequence by replacing the sums\nby the min operator and obtain the recursion relations\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\b M\nM +1\nM\n0\nEi,j+1\n= min Ei,j\n, min\nEi,k\u22121 + Ek,j+1\n(S2a)\nk=i+1,...,j\n\b m\n0\nEk,j+1\n=\nmin\nEk+1,j + \u03b5k,j+1 .\n(S2b)\nm=0,...,j+1\u2212k\n\n\u03b5k,j+1 is the free energy of the base pair (k, j + 1). From the three-dimensional array the mfe structure can now be\nobtained by a recursive backtracking algorithm.

For instance, the\nentries in the row UA and the column GC in the following table, hUA,GC and sUA,GC , give the enthalpy and entropy\ncontribution due to the stacking of the two neighboring base pairs UA and GC, where U and C are located at the\n5'-end. The two bottom rows contain the initiation and termination contribution to helices and loops.
