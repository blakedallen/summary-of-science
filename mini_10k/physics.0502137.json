We show in this paper\nthat this does not need to be so and that other possibilities remain to choose\ninterpretative assumptions for the quantity length that can be falsified by\n\u2217\n\nwtpbedil@lg.ehu.es\n\n1\n\n\fexperiments, and in particular by the Western Australia experiment by Tobar\net al., [1], now in process of being completed1 .\n\n1\n\nFrames of reference with constant angular\nvelocity\n\nLet ds2 be the line element of Minkowski's space-time referred to a system\nof Cartesian coordinates of a Galilean frame of reference so that:\nds2 = \u2212c2 dT 2 + dX 2 + dY 2 + dZ 2\n\n(1)\n\nThe motion of a frame of reference with constant angular velocity \u03a9 is a\ntime-like Killing congruence with parametric equations such as:\nT\nX\nY\nZ\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nt\nx cos \u03a9t \u2212 y sin \u03a9t\nx sin \u03a9t + y cos \u03a9t\nz\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere x, y, z are coordinates of the quotient space and the parameter t is\na particular time coordinate defining one among all other possible synchronizations. Using this system of adapted coordinates to the rotating frame of\nreference the line-element of the space-time becomes:\nds2 = \u2212\u03be 2 c2 dt2 + 2\u03c9(xdy \u2212 ydx)cdt + dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03a9/c, and :\nq\n\nq\n\n(7)\n\nds2 = \u2212\u03c8 2 + d\u015d2\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c8 = \u2212\u03becdt + \u03c9\u03be \u22121(xdy \u2212 ydx)\n\n(9)\n\n\u03be=\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c12 ,\n\nthat can be split as follows:\n\n\u03c1=\n\nx2 + y 2\n\nwith:\n\nwhich is the 1-form whose components are the covariant components of the\nunit vector field tangent to the killing congruence, and with:\n1\n\nSee also the reference [2] added in this replacement\n\n2\n\n\fd\u015d2 = dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 + \u03c9 2 \u03be \u22122 (y 2dx2 + x2 dy 2 \u2212 2xydxdy)\n\n(10)\n\nLet us consider a domain of the rotating frame of reference where there\nis at rest a medium with index of refraction n so that the velocity of light in\nthis medium is vn = c/n. According to well established theory, [4], if light is\npropagating freely it will follow a geodesic of the following space-time metric:\n1 2\n)\u03c8\n(11)\nn2\nAnd similarly if light, because of multiple reflexions, or equivalent constraints,\nis forced to propagate along any space circuit, still its propagation will have\nto satisfy the condition:\nds2n = ds2 + (1 \u2212\n\ndsn = 0.\n\n(12)\n\nLet us consider in particular a closed circuit C with parametric equations:\nx = fx (\u03c7),\n\ny = fy (\u03c7),\n\nz = fz (\u03c7)\n\n(13)\n\nsuch that:\nfx (\u03c70 ) = fx (\u03c71 ) = x0 ,\n\nfy (\u03c70 ) = fy (\u03c71 ) = y0 ,\n\nfz (\u03c70 ) = fz (\u03c71 ) = z0 (14)\n\nFrom (11) and (12) it follows that:\nn\nd\u015d \u03c9 \u22122 dy\ndx\ndt\n= \u03be \u22121\n+ \u03be (x\n\u2212y )\nd\u03c7\nc\nd\u03c7\nc\nd\u03c7\nd\u03c7\n\n(15)\n\nThe sign of the second term in the r-h-s depends upon the direction in which\nlight is propagating. Therefore if two light rays leave the point P0 at proper\ntime \u03c40 and propagate in different directions then they will reach again the\npoint P0 at two different proper times \u03c4+ and \u03c4\u2212 such that:\n\u03c9\n1\n(\u03c4+ \u2212 \u03c4\u2212 ) = \u03be0 \u03be \u22122 (xdy \u2212 ydx)\n(16)\n2\nc\nC\n\u03be0 being the value of \u03be at the point P0 . This result is the celebrated Sagnac\neffect.\nThis paper will show the importance of the complementary result:\nZ\n\n1\nn\n(\u03c4+ + \u03c4\u2212 ) = \u03be0\n2\nc\n\n3\n\nZ\n\nC\n\n\u03be \u22121 d\u015d\n\n(17)\n\n\f2\n\nFree mobility of ideal rigid bodies\n\nSuppose that we want to give an operational meaning to Eq. (17). The l-h-s\nhas a very clear meaning: it is the mean proper period of light propagating\nin both directions. This is not the case of the r-h-s. To make sense of it we\nneed to be able to identify the measurable properties of the circuit with the\ngeometrical figure that describes it. If in particular we are dealing with a\ncircular circuit C with a measured radius r according to any given protocol\nwe need to know how to use this value using a chosen geometry of space.\nMore precisely: we need to know how to derive from this value of r the\nparametric equations of the circuit C, and then to calculate the line-integral\nof Eq. (17).\nWe know that the result should be intrinsic, i.e. independent of the system\nof coordinates being used, but it can not be, as we show below independent\nof a crucial choice of a metric to describe the geometry of space. Is this choice\nthat we claim in Sec. 4 can be subject to an experimental test. Let dl2 be\nthis metric, that at this stage it can be considered as an auxiliary metric,\nchosen for convenience:\ndl2 = aij dxi dxj\n\n(18)\n\nwhere x1 = x, x2 = y and x3 = z. To give a meaning to the r-h-s of Eq. (17)\nthe strategy that we shall implement in Sec. 4 will be the following: i) we\n\u2032\n\u2032\nshall obtain and use the geodesic coordinates, [5], xi = xi (xj ) of (18) so\nthat:\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nai\u2032 j \u2032 = \u03b4i\u2032 j \u2032 \u2212 Ri\u2032 k\u2032 j \u2032l\u2032 xk xl\n(19)\n3\nto the second order of approximation around the point C0 , the center of the\n\u2032\ncircle, with coordinates xi = 0;\nand ii) we shall use the fact that in this system of coordinates a geodesic\ndisk of radius r centered at C0 is a central section of the sphere:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(x1 )2 + (x2 )2 + (x3 )2 = r 2 ;\n\n(20)\n\nThe most apparently natural choice that we could make to choose a metric\nof space would be to assume that dl2 = d\u015d2 because:\nZ\n\nL\n\nd\u015d2 =\n\nZ\n\nL\n\nds2\n\n(21)\n\nwhere L is any path orthogonal to the Killing congruence of the frame of\nreference. This is the choice that most authors take for granted.\n4\n\n\fA second choice to describe the geometry of space that is directly suggested by (17), but has also been proposed following other considerations,\n[6], is:\nd\u01612 = \u03be \u22122 d\u015d2\n\n(22)\n\nA third choice that we shall consider in Sec. 4 is:\nds\u03032 = \u03be 2 d\u015d2\n\n(23)\n\nThis metric has been considered in [7], [8] and [9] because it cures some odd\nanomalies of the Schwarzschild and Curzon space-times, and for technical\nconvenience in [10] and [11].\nBut none of these metrics is flat and this poses a serious problem of\nprinciple. In fact it is elementary knowledge of Riemannian geometry that\nwhatever is this geometry, as long as it does not has constant curvature, the\nratio L/r, L being the perimeter of a geodesic circle, depends on the location\nand the orientation of this circle. That is alright to model a particular circular\ncircuit with a measured physical radius r and perimeter L as long as we\nrestrain from moving it from point to point or from changing its orientation.\nBut, in principle, no metrologist should accept these restrictions.\nIn Sect. 4 we shall see that under the conditions of the Western Australia\nexperiment we may be tempted to dismiss this free mobility problem of ideal\nrigid bodies as irrelevant, and this would be indeed the case if we thought\nonly in terms of manufacturing specifications of real rigid bodies. But as we\nshall see the prediction of the outcome of the experiment is very sensitive to\nwhatever choice is made: either to dismiss it or to cure the problem.\nA fourth choice that we shall consider is to implement the Principle of\nfree mobility introducing a flat metric2 intrinsically associated to the Killing\ncongruence. We developed elsewhere, [12], a general theory to do that but\nthe full theory is not needed here because the metric (10) is particularly\nsimple and can be written as:\nd\u015d2 = d\u03ba2 + dz 2\n\n(24)\n\nwhere d\u03ba2 is a 2-dimensional Riemannian metric of a 2-dimensional manifold\nwith coordinates x, y. Therefore we know from one of Gauss's theorems that\nit is possible to find a function \u03bc such that the metric:\nds\u03042 = e2\u03bc d\u03ba2 + dz 2\n2\n\nA constant non zero curvature does not seem appropriate here.\n\n5\n\n(25)\n\n\fbe flat. Actually the function \u03bc that satisfies the required regularity conditions at the axis of symmetry is:\n\u03bc = \u03be \u2212 ln(1 + \u03be \u22121 ) \u2212 1 + ln 2\n\n(26)\n\nand it is unique.\n\n3\n\nWhispering gallery modes\n\nWhispering gallery modes are being used in the Michelson-Morley experiment\nthat is in the process of completion at the University of Western Australia\nand that we shall analyze in the next section from the theoretical point of\nview. Below we shall give a very simplified description of what these modes\nare but we refer interested readers to references [1], [3].\nLet us consider a circular ring, made of a dielectric with magnetic permeability\u221a\u03bc = 1 and electric permittivity \u01eb so that the index of refraction\nis n = c \u01eb, where light circulates around in both directions. We assume\nthat the amplitude A of either wave is the same as well as the frequency \u03bd\nbut, although as we shall see in the next section this will be irrelevant, for\ncompleteness we do not assume that the periods of rotation \u03c4+ and \u03c4\u2212 are\nequal. Consequently we define two wave-lengths \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 such that:\n\u03bd\u03bb+ =\n\nL\n,\nn\u03c4+\n\n\u03bd\u03bb\u2212 =\n\nL\nn\u03c4\u2212\n\n(27)\n\nwhere L is the length of the ring. The amplitude \u03a6 of the superposition of\nthe two waves is:\n\u03a6 = A cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt \u2212 2\u03c0\n\nl\nl\n) + A cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt + 2\u03c0 )\n\u03bb+\n\u03bb\u2212\n\n(28)\n\nwhere l is the winding length around the circle measured from an arbitrary\npoint on it.

One of them, say A, has one of its diameters in the\ndirection of the vertical of the location and it is slowly rotating around this\ndirection. The second one, say B, is horizontal and although it rotates with\nA we may as well consider it as fixed for the purpose of analyzing the experiment. The frequencies \u03bdA and \u03bdB are continuously monitored and compared.\nWe give below our analysis of this experiment.\n7\n\n\fThe experiment is being made at the University of Western Australia that\nis at a co-latitude \u03b8 = 58\u25e6 South. Therefore we have:\n\u03a9\u03c10 2\n\u2248 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 , \u03c10 = R sin \u03b8\n(38)\nc\nwhere R is the radius and \u03a9 is the angular velocity of the Earth, which is the\nrelevant frame of reference to consider here. From now on we shall neglect\nthe powers of \u03b4.\nAt this approximation we have the following expressions for the four metrics (22)-(25):\n\u03b4\u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u015d2 = (1 + \u03c9 2 y 2 )dx2 + (1 + \u03c9 2 x2 )dy 2 \u2212 2\u03c9 2xydxdy + dz 2\nd\u01612 = (1 + \u03c9 2 (2y 2 + x2 ))dx2 + (1 + \u03c9 2 (2x2 + y 2))dx2\n\u22122\u03c9 2 xydxdy + (1 + \u03c9 2\u03c12 )dz 2\nds\u03032 = (1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 x2 )dx2 + (1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 y 2 )dx2 \u2212 2\u03c9 2xydxdy + (1 \u2212 \u03c9 2\u03c12 )dz 2\n1\n1\nds\u03042 = (1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 (3x2 + y 2 ))dx2 + (1 \u2212 \u03c9 2(3y 2 + x2 ))dy 2\n2\n2\n\u22122\u03c9 2 xydxdy + dz 2\n\n(39)\n(40)\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\nSince by construction the fourth metric ds\u03042 is Euclidean there exists a\nsystem of coordinates that will bring it to the Cartesian form:\nds\u03042 = dx\u03042 + d\u0233 2 + dz\u0304 2\n\n(43)\n\nTo do that the appropriate change of coordinates is:\n1\n1\nx = x\u0304 + \u03c9 2 x\u0304\u03c1\u03042 , y = \u0233 + \u03c9 2\u0233 \u03c1\u03042 , z = z\u0304\n(44)\n4\n4\nUsing this convenient system of coordinates the four metrics above can be\nwritten collectively as:\ndl2 = (1 + \u03b1\u03c9 2 \u03c1\u03042 )(dx\u03042 + d\u0233 2) + (1 + \u03b2\u03c9 2\u03c1\u03042 )dz\u0304 2\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two parameters whose values are:\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\ndl2\ndl2\ndl2\ndl2\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nds\u03042\nd\u015d2\nd\u01612\nds\u03032\n\nthen\nthen\nthen\nthen\n8\n\n\u03b1 = 0,\n\u03b1 = 3/2,\n\u03b1 = 5/2,\n\u03b1 = 1/2,\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n= 0\n=0\n= +1\n= \u22121\n\n(46)\n(47)\n(48)\n(49)\n\n\fThe non zero strict components of the Riemann tensor of dl2 are:\nR1212 = \u22122\u03b1\u03c9 2 ,\n\nR3131 = R2323 = \u2212\u03b2\u03c9 2\n\n(50)\n\nLet us now name x\u03040 , \u02330 and z\u03040 the coordinates of the location of the\nexperiment with:\nx\u03040 = R sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\n\u02330 = R sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 z\u03040 = R cos \u03b8\n\n(51)\n\nThe metric dl2 in a geodesic system of coordinates anchored at the point\nC0 with coordinates x\u2032 = y \u2032 = z \u2032 = 0 can be derived using (19) and (50). We\nget thus:\n1\n1\ndl2 = (1 + (2\u03b1\u03c9 2y \u20322 + \u03b2\u03c9 2 z \u20322 ))dx\u20322 + (1 + (2\u03b1\u03c9 2x\u20322 + \u03b2\u03c9 2z \u20322 ))dy \u20322\n3\n3\n1 2 \u20322 \u20322 4 2 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 2 2 \u2032 \u2032\n+(1 + \u03b2\u03c9 \u03c1 )dz \u2212 \u03b1\u03c9 x y dx dy \u2212 \u03b2\u03c9 (x dx + y \u2032 dy \u2032)z \u2032 dz \u2032 (52)\n3\n3\n3\nThe coordinate transformation that brings dl2 to this form is:\n1\n1\nx\u0304 = x\u03040 + x\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c9 2 (\u03c1\u030420 x\u2032 + x\u03040 (x\u20322 \u2212 y \u20322 ) + 2\u02330 x\u2032 y \u2032 + x\u2032 \u03c1\u20322 )\n2\n3\n1\n1 2 \u20322\n+ \u03b2\u03c9 z (x\u03040 + x\u2032 )\n2\n3\n1\n1\n\u0233 = \u02330 + y \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c9 2(\u03c1\u030420 y \u2032 + \u02330 (y \u20322 \u2212 x\u20322 ) + 2x\u03040 y \u2032x\u2032 + y \u2032\u03c1\u20322 )\n2\n3\n1\n1 2 \u20322\n+ \u03b2\u03c9 z (\u02330 + y \u2032)\n2\n3\n1\n1\nz\u0304 = z\u03040 + z \u2032 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c9 2 z \u2032 ( \u03c1\u030420 + x\u03040 x\u2032 + \u02330 y \u2032 + \u03c1\u20322 )\n2\n3\n\n(53)\n\n(54)\n(55)\n\nLet us consider a geodesic circle with center at C0 lying in a plane orthogonal to the axis of rotation. The parametric equations will be then:\nx\u2032 = r cos \u03c7,\n\ny \u2032 = r sin \u03c7,\n\nz \u2032 = 0;\n\n(56)\n\nwhere r is its geodesic radius, i.e. its proper length in the sense of the chosen\ngeometry of space. Calculating the perimeter of the circle we get:\n1\ndl = 2\u03c0r(1 + \u03b1\u03c9 2r 2 )\n(57)\n3\nC\nWhile if the plane of the circle contains the axis of rotation then its parametric\nequations are for example:\nLh =\n\nZ\n\n9\n\n\fx\u2032 = r cos \u03c7,\n\ny \u2032 = 0,\n\nz \u2032 = r sin \u03c7\n\n(58)\n\nand we get:\n1\ndl = 2\u03c0r(1 + \u03b2\u03c9 2r 2 )\n(59)\n6\nC\nThis shows that the ratio L/r depends, strictly speaking, upon the orientation of the circle, except in the case when dl2 = ds\u03042 , i.e. \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.\nTherefore none of the remaining metrics should be used in principle to describe the geometrical properties of ideal rigid bodies. On the other hand\nsince:\nLv =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9r\n\u2248 10\u221215\n(60)\nc\nit can be argued that this change of shape is well beyond the specifications\nunder which the sapphire spheres are manufactured and therefore are irrelevant to the experiment that we are describing. This would be to forget that\nthe modifications shown by Eqs. (57) and (59) are not elastic deformations\ni.e.: they do not depend on any physical property. In fact in our opinion they\nmay just reveal an inadequacy in the choice of metric. The purpose of this\npaper is to claim that these two points of view can be tested by the Western\nAustralia experiment.\nFrom (17) and (37) it follows that:\n\u03b7\u2261\n\n\u22121\nNc\n\u22121\n\u03be\nd\u015d\n\u03be\n(61)\n0\n2n2\nC\na formula where we can now calculate the r-h-s making different choices of\ngeometries and choosing C to be in succession the circuit of the whispering\ngallery mode A and B. Using a system of geodesic coordinates of dl2 , it follows from (53) that the line-element d\u01612 , i.e. the integrand in (61), becomes,\nneglecting any terms of order \u03b4\u03b7 or smaller and identifying \u03c1\u03040 with rho0 :\n\n\u03bd=\n\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u01612 = (1 + (5/2 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c9 2\u03c120 )(dx\u20322 + dy \u20322) + (1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03c9 2\u03c120 )dz \u20322\n\n(62)\n\ntherefrom, choosing appropriately the parametric equations of the circuit C\nthe r-h-s of (61) can be calculated.\nLet us choose as origin of the angle \u03c6 describing the rotation of A the\nposition of the plane of this circle when it lyes along the meridian of C0 . The\nparametric equations of the circle A are then:\n\n10\n\n\fx\u2032 = r(cos \u03c6 cos \u03c7 cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03c7 sin \u03b8)\ny \u2032 = r sin \u03c6 cos \u03c7\nz \u2032 = r(sin \u03c7 cos \u03b8 + cos \u03c6 cos \u03c7 sin \u03b8)\n\n(63)\n(64)\n(65)\n\nand those of B are:\nx\u2032 = r(cos \u03c6 cos \u03c7 \u2212 sin \u03c7 sin \u03c6) cos \u03b8\ny \u2032 = r(sin \u03c6 cos \u03c7 + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c7)\nz \u2032 = r(cos \u03c6 cos \u03c7 \u2212 sin \u03c7 sin \u03c6) sin \u03b8\n\n(66)\n(67)\n(68)\n\nwith \u03c7 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0].\nWe obtain thus for the whispering gallery mode B of reference:\nNc\n1 3\n\u03bdB = 2\n1 \u2212 ( \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c9 2 \u03c120 (1 + cos2 \u03b8)\n2n L\n4 2\nNc\n+ 2 \u03b2\u03c9 2\u03c120 sin2 \u03b8\n8n L\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(69)\n\nand for A is:\n1 3\nNc\n1\n1 \u2212 ( \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c9 2\u03c120 (1 + sin2 \u03b8(1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c6)\n\u03bdA = 2\n2n L\n4 2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2\nNc\n2 2\n+ 2 \u03b2\u03c9 \u03c10 1 \u2212 sin \u03b8(1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c6)\n8n L\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(70)\n\nThe full signature of the experiment depends on the colatitude \u03b8 and the two\nparameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, but special interest deserves the first harmonic of the \u03c6\ndependence of \u03bdA at twice the rotation frequency of the platform:\n1 3\n(71)\na2 = ( \u2212 \u03b1 + \u03b2)\u03c9 2R2 sin4 \u03b8\n8 2\nMore explicitly when ds\u03042 is chosen as geometry of space then the prediction is:\n\nwhile it is:\n\na2 \u2248 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221213\n\n(72)\n\na2 = 0\n\n(73)\n\n11\n\n\ffor the other three line-elements dl2 that we have considered in (46). This\ncommon zero value comes from the fact that these three metrics are conformal.\nAlthough irrelevant in the analysis of the Western Australia experiment\nlet us mention the order of magnitude of the Sagnac effect in this experiment.\nDefining:\nS\u2261\n\n\u03c4+ \u2212 \u03c4\u2212\n\u03c4+ + \u03c4\u2212\n\n(74)\n\nusing (16) and (17) at the lowest order of approximation, a calculation similar\nto the preceding one yields:\nSB =\n\n\u03b7\ncos \u03b8,\nn\n\nSA =\n\n\u03b7\nsin \u03c6 sin \u03b8\nn\n\n(75)\n\nwith \u03b7 defined in (60)\n\nConclusion\nThe Western Australia experiment has been conceived as a test of Special\nrelativity, but as we understand it, it is mainly a test of a crucial collateral\nassumption having to do with the geometry of space in a frame of reference\nco-rotating with the Earth. This is not a trivial matter that can be dismissed\ninvoking a Principle of Lorentz Local Invariance saying that only the instantaneous velocity with respect to a local non-rotating frame of reference is\nwhat matters in describing the experiment, because this principle is also a\ncollateral assumption that needs to be substantiated.\nKeeping in mind that the reliability of our analysis strongly depends upon\nthe fidelity of the over-simplified model of Whispering Gallery Modes that we\nhave used to real ones, we give below a short description of possible outcomes\nwith an indication of what they would mean, assuming ideally that the values\nof the two parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 could be tested.\nEach couple of values corresponds to a geometry of space, or in other\nwords, to a choice to identify an operational measure of length with a calculated geometrical quantity. We have mentioned four such choices, with\ndifferent justifications, but we could as well leave the choice open and let\nexperiments decide which is the best choice to make.\nThe first choice, which in our opinion deserves a particular attention is\n(\u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 = 0), i.e. dl2 = ds\u03042 . If this is correct this will mean that\nthe Principle of Free Mobility of ideal rigid bodies holds and this would\nopen the door to a better understanding of what length and distance mean\n12\n\n\fin Special relativity beyond the Galilean frames of reference, as well as in\nGeneral relativity. On the other hand if this principle does not hold then we\nare afraid that it will be harder than we thought to develop a satisfactory\ngeneral theory about frames of reference.\nThe three other metrics that we have considered will look reassuring to\nthose who believe in the indiscriminate validity of the Principle of Local\nLorentz Invariance because if anyone of these metrics is the correct choice\nthe experiment will not give any meaningful signal: both frequencies \u03bdA and\n\u03bdB will remain constant up to the precision that it is achieved. A value of a2\nsignificantly below 10\u221213 would undoubtedly favor this interpretation, and\ncould be considered an important conclusion because it would be the first\ntest of the crucial assumption that it implies.\nAn outcome of the same order of magnitude as in the preceding case with\ndifferent values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 would be an encouraging surprise strongly suggesting the dynamical importance of the rotation of the Earth to understand\nthe Western Australia experiment.\nFinally, let us say that any other outcome would be a puzzling and exciting surprise, and it is only in this case that we could allow any credibility\nto the fact that we have peeped beyond the domain of validity of Special\nrelativity.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI gratefully acknowledge the hospitality of the Theoretical Physics Department of the UPV/EHU, and a careful reading of the manuscript by A.
