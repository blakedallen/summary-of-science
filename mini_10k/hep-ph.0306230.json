Tobar\nFrequency Standards and Metrology Research Group, School of Physics, M013, University of\nWestern Australia Crawley, 6009, WA, Australia\nAbstract\nThe fine structure constant, \u03b1, is shown to be proportional to the ratio of the quanta of electric and\nmagnetic flux of force of the electron, and provides a new representation, which is global across all\nunit systems. Consequently, a variation in \u03b1 was shown to manifest due to a differential change in\nthe fraction of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force, while a variation in hc was shown\nto manifest due to the common mode change. The representation is discussed with respect to the\nrunning of the fine structure constant at high energies (small distances), and a putative temporal\ndrift. It is shown that the running of the fine structure constant is due to equal components of\nelectric screening (polarization of vacuum) and magnetic anti-screening (magnetization of vacuum),\nwhich cause the perceived quanta of electric charge to increase at small distances, while the\nmagnetic flux quanta decreases. This introduces the concept of the 'bare magnetic flux quanta' as\nwell as the 'bare electric charge'. With regards to temporal drift, it is confirmed that it is impossible\nto determine which fundamental constant is varying if \u03b1 varies.\nPACS: 04.80.Cc, 06.20.Jr\nKeywords: Fundamental Constants, Fine Structure Constant, Magnetic Flux Quanta\n1. Introduction\nThe fine structure constant is very important in QED 1, It was first introduced by Sommerfeld 2 to\nexplain the fine structure in hydrogen atoms, as the ratio of the electron velocity to the speed of\nlight; the meaning of the constant has now evolved to be a measure of the strength of the\nelectromagnetic field. Recent experimental evidence that the fine structure constant may be\ndrifting3,4 and has triggered much interest in theories that account for the drift in fundamental\nconstants 5-10. Also, it has provided stimulus to laboratory tests, which aim to improve the precision\nof measurements of the constancy of the fine structure constant11-13. Furthermore, it is well\nestablished that the fine structure constant varies with energy (or distance) as one probes close to\nthe electron14. In this paper the fine structure constant is represented in terms of only\n\n\felectromagnetic quantities15,16. For the SI unit representation, this includes the quantum of electric\ncharge e, the quantum of magnetic flux \u03c60, and the permittivity and permeability of free space, \u03b50\nand \u03bc0.\nTo solve systems in Classical Electrodynamics it is common to represent the problem in terms of\nthe co-ordinates of charge or magnetic flux. Both are conserved quantities and are considered dual\nvariables17, and one may formulate a problem in terms of either of these quantities and get the same\nsolution. This fact may lead one to consider solving quantum systems in terms of magnetic flux,\nwhich has been attempted in the past. Jehle spent a large part of his life developing a theory of the\nelectron and elementary particles based on quantized magnetic flux loops18. Also, Dirac suggested\nthe existence of the magnetic monopole to describe the charge of the electron19. Both these theories\nrely on a physical relationship between flux and charge. In the case of the Jehle model, he suggested\nthat the electron was made of quantized flux loops, spinning at the Zitterbewegung frequency. Since\nit is well known the magnetic flux is quantized, it seems plausible that the quantized value of flux\nshould play a role in the description of particle physics. Jehle developed a series of papers, which\nattempted to do this based on the quantized flux loop18,20-22. The relation between the electric and\nmagnetic properties is fundamental to electrodynamics as charge in motion produces magnetic flux.\n2. Alternative representation of the fine structure constant\nUsually the fine structure constant (or coupling constant) is defined from the static Coulomb force\nbetween two charges. The force, Fe, in SI units is given by;\nFe =\n\ne2\n4!\" or 2\n\n(1)\n\nHere e is the electric charge in Coulombs, r is the separation between the charges in meters, and \u03b50\nis the permittivity of free space in Farads per meter. To consider the strength between two static\ncharges in terms of fundamental constants, one must ignore the inverse square nature of the force\nand just consider the constant of proportionality\n\ne2\n\n4!\" o\n\n. Because this proportionality constant has\n\nthe dimensions of energy \u00d7 distance, the dimensionless constant can be constructed by dividing by\n\nhc, which also has the same units. Thus, it is usual to write the fine structure constant in SI units as\nthe following;\n!=\n\ne2\n4\"# o hc\n\n(2)\n\nSimilar coupling constants are also written for the strong, weak and gravitational forces. If one\nanalyses these coupling constants it may be seen that they too are represented as a dimensionless\n\n\fconstant by comparing the constants of proportionality of the force with hc 1. Thus, when we\ndiscuss these dimensionless constants relative to one another they represent comparative strengths\nof the different forces. For example, the strong force coupling constant, is approximately one, the\nelectromagnetic is 1/137 the weak is 10-6, and gravity 10-39.\nThe logic of defining (2) above, leads many to state that \u03b1 must be proportional to the strength of\nthe Coulomb (electric) force, as it is proportional to e2. However, atomic systems are not just\ncomprised of static charge, as they also exhibit spin and magnetic moments. Thus, one may expect\nthe magnetic nature to be present in the definition as well as the electric. The magnetic nature is\nactually hidden in the hc term that we divided by. For example, all transitions between electron\norbit and spin states, when they interact with electromagnetic radiation, are governed by the\nfollowing equation\nE ph =\n\nhc\n! ph\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Eph is the energy of the absorbed or emitted photon, \u03bbph is the wavelength and hc is the\nconstant of proportionality. Also, hc is the proportionality constant that relates the Casimir force to\nthe dimensions of two electromagnetic neutral electrodes, and thus incorporates both the electric\nand magnetic zero point properties of the vacuum.\nThe key relations between the fundamental constants for classical and quantum electromagnetism in\nSI units are:\nc=\n\nh=\n\n1\n\n! o \u03bco\n\ne \"0\n#\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nHere \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space and \u03c60 is the quantum of magnetic flux due to the spin of\nthe electron. The flux is equal to the minimum quanta of spin angular momentum, divided by the\n!\nquanta of charge, and is the same as the flux produced by a Cooper pair23-25 (This was recently\nderived in26 on the basis of the magnetic top model). Equation (4) and (5) basically give a simple\ndescription of the relation between electric and magnetic quantities. Now given that the fine\nstructure constant is an electromagnetic constant it would be instructive to substitute (4) and (5) into\n(2) to actually express it in terms of the electric and magnetic constants, \u03c60, e, \u03b50 and \u03bc0. If we do\nthis (2) becomes:\n\n\fThis representation of the fine structure constant is now expressed as ratios of the classical and\nquantum electromagnetic constants. In actual fact \u03bco ! is the impedance of free space and e 2!\no\no\nis the Quantum Hall conductance.\n2.1 Representation in terms of static magnetic and electric flux of force\nIn this section a representation of the fine structure constant is formulated in terms of the quanta of\nstatic magnetic and electric flux of force, which turns out to be global for all unit systems (see\nappendix A). First, a simple classical static model of a magnetic flux is introduced, which is similar\nto a magnetic circuit. Since magnetic fields are solenoidal, magnetic flux may be modeled as a loop\n(i.e. no matter on how complicated the path it will eventually come back to where it started). A\nsimple circuit model of this type is shown in figure 1. One may consider the flux loop as a circular\nmagnet with a north and a south pole held together by an attractive magnetic force. In SI units the\nforce between the north and south pole is given by;\nF! =\n\n!o2\n2 \u03bco A\n\n(7)\n\nwhere A is the effective cross section area of the magnetic loop, as shown in figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic of a magnetic flux loop with effective cross section area A.\nThe magnetic and Coulomb force given by equations (1) and (7) are not constants. For example, (1)\nfollows the inverse square law and (7) depends on the cross section area over the path of the\nmagnetic flux loop. However, the flux of electric and magnetic force, defined as the force field\nmultiplied by the cross sectional area perpendicular to the field lines, are constants and in SI units\nare given by\n\nHere, \u03a6e and \u03a6\u03c6 may be considered as the flux of electric and magnetic force generated by a static\nquantized charge, e, and a static quantized magnetic flux loop, \u03c60, respectively.\nConsidering equation (4), (5), (6) and (8) one can then show the following relations;\n\n\fhc =\n\n2\n\"e \"#\n!\n\n(10)\n\nEquations (9) and (10) together now portray a representation of \u03b1 and hc, which are symmetric in\nits electric and magnetic parts.\nIn appendix A it is shown that the equations (9) and (10) are global representations for all unit\nsystems, which is important if one wants to analyze the variation of \u03b1 in terms of dimensioned\nconstants. In the following section, this permits an analysis of the running of the fine structure\nconstant, as well as putative temporal variations, which would not be otherwise possible.\n3. Variation of the fine structure constant in terms of electric and magnetic quantities\nIt is interesting to consider the meaning of (9) and (10) if the Fine Structure Constant varies.\nBecause they are independent of unit representation they may be implicitly differentiated to obtain;\n! \" 1 & !# e !#% )\n= (\n$\n+\n\"\n2 ' #e\n#% *\n\n!(hc) 1 & !# e !#% )\n= (\n+\n+\nhc\n2 ' #e\n#% *\n\n(11)\n\nThus, we have succeeded in representing a change in \u03b1 and hc in terms of the change of the electric\nand magnetic quantities defined by (8). Here a change in \u03b1 is due to a differential variation in the\nstrength of the electric and magnetic force, while a change in hc is due to a common mode\nvariation.\n3.1 The running electromagnetic coupling constant\nIt is well established that at high energies as one probes closer to the sub-structure of an electron,\nthe fine structure constant increases14. This is due to the perceived screening of the bare electron\ncharge by polarized virtual electrons at low energies, E (or large distance). If (11) is applied to this\nsituation, we can assume hc does not vary and the following must be true,\n1 ! (hc)\n1 !\" e\n1 !\"$\n=0\n=#\nhc !E\n\" e !E\n\"$ !E\n\n(12)\n\nand thus,\n1 \"!\n1 \"# e\n1 \"#%\n=\n=$\n! \"E # e \"E\n#% \"E\n\n(13)\n\nThus at low energies, the density of the curl-free electric lines of force is reduced, due to the\nvacuum field opposing the field of the bare electron. In actual fact the virtual electrons are also in\n\n\fmotion and must posses magnetic properties as well27. In contrast at low energies, the density of the\ndivergence-free magnetic lines of force of the bare electron is enhanced. This means the magnetic\nmoments of the virtual electrons align with the magnetic moment of the bare electron, and one can\nsay the vacuum is also magnetized like a paramagnet. This has the effect of the magnetic flux\nquanta reducing to a lower value at high energies, in the opposite way to the charge, and the\nmagnetic flux quanta is thus anti-screened. This leads to the concept of the \"bare magnetic fluxquanta\" being less than the magnetic flux quanta at low energies. Previously28, this concept has also\nbeen explained by a 'bare magnetic monopole charge'. However, we point out here that it is not\nnecessary to introduce the concept of the magnetic monopole to describe this phenomenon, when\none may define it in terms of closed loops of flux. Also, because of equation (11) it is evident that\nthe running of the fine structure constant is due to equal components of electric screening and\nmagnetic anti-screening.\n3.2 Putative drift of the fine structure constant\nIt is widely accepted that when considering problems that deal with time variations of fundamental\nconstants, that it only makes sense to consider dimensionless constants7,10,29-33. However, because (9)\nand (11) are global across all unit systems, a putative drift in the fine structure constant may be\ninterpreted as a differential drift between the strength of the electric and magnetic flux of force\n(which of course have dimension). In this section we show that this finding does not contradict the\naccepted belief, that one cannot determine whether or not e or c drifts if there is a putative drift in\n\n\u03b17,10,29-33. In general one could also consider h as well as e or c, but mostly it has been assumed to\nremain constant. In this work we consider more generally the product hc, as it naturally fits with the\nmagnetic and electric flux of force representation.\nCase I: Firstly, it is assumed that the total electromagnetic energy of an electron remains constant.\nIn this case, !\" e \" e = # !\" $ \"$ , and from (11) the putative drift in \u03b1 may be written as;\n!#%\n! \" !# e\n!e\n!(hc)\n=\n=$\n=2\nand\n=0\n\"\n#e\n#%\ne\nhc\n\n(14)\n\nPhysically this means that the electric energy would be converted to magnetic energy or vice versa.\nIf this occurred one would then get a drift in \u03b1 independent of hc due to only a differential change\nin the electric and magnetic flux of force.\n\n\fCase II: Secondly, the magnetic and electric parts are assumed to vary at the same rate (common\nmode drift). In this case \"#e /#e = \"#$ /#$ , and from (11) \u03b1 will not drift but hc will. In this case\nanother energy process would need to be involved.\n\n!\nCase III: Finally, the case is considered when putative \u03b1 and hc drift are related. In this case, the\ndifferential and common mode components of (11) must be correlated. This would occur if, for\nexample, another form of energy was converted to only magnetic or electric energy but not both,\nsuch that either !\" e \" e = 0 or !\" # \"# = 0 . In this case;\n\n!#$\n! \" !(hc)\n!\"\n!(hc) !# e\n=\nif\n= 0, and\n=%\nif\n= 0 , with\n\"\nhc\n#$\n\"\nhc\n#e\n\n\"e\n=0\ne\n\n(15)\n\nThus, to unequivocally interpret which fundamental constant drifts if!\u03b1 drifts, both the common\nmode component and differential component of (11) must be known. However since hc (common\nmode component) has dimension it makes no sense to try and measure its drift. Actually, the\nmeasurement of drift in hc has been attempted previously, for reviews on these measurements see 1.\nHowever, Bekenstein34 showed these attempts generated null results as the constancy was actually\nimplied in the analysis. Therefore, we still may conclude that the absolute variation of any of the\ndimensioned fundamental constant, whether it be e, hc, \u03a6e or \u03a6\u03c6, cannot be measured. However,\ndespite this, the time variation of \u03b1 may be interpreted as the differential drift of the strength of the\nCoulomb force with respect to the magnetic force, even though they have dimension.\n4. Discussion\nThe fine structure constant, \u03b1, may be represented in many ways depending on the unit system and\nthe selection of fundamental constants. In this paper, a representation, which is global across all unit\nsystems, has been successfully obtained in terms of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force\nof the electron. It was shown that \u03b1 is proportional to the ratio of the square root of quantized\nelectric and magnetic flux of force, while hc was shown to be proportional to the product. Because\nthe representation is global across all unit systems an analysis of the variation of the fine structure\nconstant was successfully made. The variation in \u03b1 was described as a differential change in the\nflux of force associated with the quanta of electric charge and magnetic flux of the electron. In\ncontrast, a change in hc (and hence Casimir Force) can be described as a common mode change in\nthe same variables. With regards to the running of \u03b1 at high energies, it was shown that it may be\n\n\fdescribed by both vacuum polarization and magnetization effects, and introduces the new concept\nof the 'bare magnetic flux quanta'. It was also shown that it is not possible to determine the physical\nprocess behind any putative \u03b1 drift, as the measurement process does not allow the determination of\nthe common mode drift of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force, even if it occurs.\nAppendix. Global unit system\nIn this appendix equations (9) and (10) are shown to be global across all unit systems by converting\nto the generalized unit system of Jackson35. For this unit system Maxwell's equations in vacuum are\ngiven by35\n\nHere the subscript g refers to the general units of Jackson (which encompasses all electromagnetic\nunit systems depending on the values of k1, k2 and k3). The conversion between SI and Jackson's\nunits can be simply made with the following substitutions35:\n\nThus in the general unit system (6) becomes,\n\nwhere the vacuum impedance is given by Z0, g = 4 \" k2 k1\nand the quantum Hall resistance by\nk\n3\n\nRh,g =\n\n2\" 0,g\n\neg\n\n. In the same way, the electric, \"e,g , and magnetic, \"# ,g , flux of force of the electron\n\ngiven by (8) can be shown to be\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\nCombining (A4) with (A3) to eliminate k1, k2 and k3 gives;\n\nwhich is equivalent to (9) as expected.\nTo proceed and show that (10) is also global across all unit systems, the fine structure constant\ngiven in (2) can be represented in the global unit system as:\neg2\n\" = k1\nh gc g\n\n!\n\n(A6)\n\n\fCombining (A4), (A5) and (A6) to eliminate k1 and \u03b1, the following is obtained\nh gc g =\n\n2\n#e,g #$ ,g\n\"\n\n(A7)\n\nas expected.\n!\nFrom the above analysis, it is also possible\nto represent the constants k1, k2 and k3 in terms of only\n\nfundamental constants\n\n\" h gc g\n\" hg\n\" 2 h 2g\n, k2 = 2 , k3 = 2 2\nk1 =\neg2\neg c g\n# 0,g eg\n\n(A8)\n\nand is valid for all unit systems. Examples for four commonly chosen unit systems are shown below\nin table I.\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\nTo uniquely determine an arbitrary unit system in classical electrodynamics and in vacuum, one\nneeds to specify the three constants k1, k2 and k3.\u2020 However, in quantum electrodynamics one other\nconstant that specifies the quantum nature must also be specified, along with k1, k2 and k3. For\nexample, one could choose one of h g , eg or \u03c60,g and all others would follow by applying equations\n(A1) to (A8). Another approach would be simply to choose the values of the four fundamental\nconstants cg, h g , eg and \u03c60,g, then all other parameters in the unit system including k1, k2 and k3, could\n!\nbe determined.\n\n!\nTable 1. Values of some constants of quantum electrodynamics for some selected unit systems.\n\n\u2020\n\nThe inclusion of media is left out as it adds the extra complication of including polarization and magnetization of\nmagnetic and dielectric media without adding to the discussion. However, if one wants to define the permittivity and\npermeability within the unit system, it is necessary to consider these details (see Jackson for further details35).\n\n\fOf the unit systems presented in Table I, Natural units are perhaps the simplest as k2, k3, cg and h g\nare selected to be unity. In contrast, SI and CGS units were developed within a framework that\nwould facilitate relating the standard units of mechanics to electromagnetism. In the SI system, the\n!\ndefinition of the absolute ampere and the speed of light determine the parameters cSI = 299792458\nm/s, eSI = 1.60217733\u00d710-19 C, k2 = 10-7 and k3 = 1. The rest of the parameters listed in Table 1 can\nthen be determined from these four values. In CGS units a similar approach could be made, with\n2\ncCGS = 29979245800 cm/s, eCGS = 4.80320680\u00d710-10 statcoulombs, k2 = 1/ cCGS\nand k3 = 1/cCGS.\n\nRydberg units are similar to CGS, with the speed of light and charge of the electron specified\ndifferently, cCGS = 2/\u03b1 and eCGS =\nAcknowledgements\n\n2.\n\n!\n\n!\n\nThe author has had many interesting discussions with Dr. Ian Mc Arthur and Dr. Paul Abbott\nregarding this work.
