In orientationally ordered phases of the host, the introduction of solid particles deforms\nthe director field, leading to long-range interactions between the particles and effects such as chaining or the formation\nof soft solids. Colloidal dispersions in liquid crystals have a wide range of applications [3] and have recently attracted\na great deal of interest [4].\nExperimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy or confocal microscopy may be used to study LC-colloid\ndispersions; simulations and theory have also been applied. Simulations have been used to study the ordering of LC\nmolecules around one [5, 6] or two macroparticles [7], and LC dispersions in confined geometries [8]. Phenomenological\ntheories such as Landau-de Gennes [9, 10, 11, 12] or Frank elastic [13, 14] theory have also been used. These approaches\nhowever have their limitations: simulation is computationally expensive, while the aforementioned phenomenological\ntheories require, often poorly known, parameters, and are incapable of accounting for spatial variation in the density\n(and, in the case of elastic theory, variation in the order parameter).\nOne popular theoretical method that may be applied to this type of problem is density functional theory (DFT)\n[15]. Unlike Landau-de Gennes or elastic theory, this is capable of accounting for spatial variation in the density\nand order parameter and, in the form used here, requires knowledge only of the interaction potential between the\nmolecules in the fluid. In this case DFT at the level of the Onsager second virial approximation [16] is applied to\nthe case of a single, infinitely long, cylindrical macroparticle in a LC host. As the system is homogeneous along the\nlength of the cylinder, two dimensions are sufficient to represent the spatial dependence of the density.\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nFor a system of uniaxial molecules the grand potential can be written as [17]\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03b2\u03a9 [\u03c1(r, u)] = \u03b2Fid [\u03c1(r, u)] + \u03b2Fex [\u03c1(r, u)] + \u03b2\ndrdu Vext (r, u) \u2212 \u03bc \u03c1(r, u) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1(r, u) is the position- and orientation-dependent single particle density, Vext (r, u) is the external potential,\n\u03bc is the chemical potential, and \u03b2 = 1/kB T . Fid [\u03c1(r, u)] and Fex [\u03c1(r, u)] are the ideal and excess free energies,\nrespectively. r is the position vector and u is the orientation vector. The ideal free energy is given by\nZ\n\b\n\u03b2Fid [\u03c1(r, u)] =\ndrdu \u03c1(r, u) log \u03c1(r, u) \u2212 1 .\n(2)\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: david.cheung@warwick.ac.uk\naddress: m.p.allen@warwick.ac.uk\n\n\f2\nThe exact form of the excess free energy is generally unknown. Here we employ the Onsager approximation [16]\nZ\n1\n\u03b2Fex [\u03c1(r, u)] = \u2212\ndr1 dr2 du1 du2 f (r12 , u1 , u2 )\u03c1(r1 , u1 )\u03c1(r2 , u2 ) ,\n(3)\n2\n\b\nwhere f (r12 , u1 , u2 ) = exp \u2212\u03b2V (r12 , u1 , u2 ) \u2212 1, the Mayer function, r12 = r1 \u2212 r2 and V (r12 , u1 , u2 ) is the\nmolecular pair interaction potential. The liquid crystal here is modelled as a fluid of prolate hard ellipsoids of\nelongation e = a/b = 5; a is the length of the symmetry, or major, axis and we will use the minor axis b = 1 as a\nunit of length. When two molecules overlap, V = \u221e and f = \u22121; for a non-overlapping pair, V = 0 and f = 0. The\napproximation of eqn (3) corresponds to truncating the virial expansion after the pair term. While Onsager theory is\nexact only in the limit of infinite elongation, it has been used to study the anchoring of ellipsoids of this elongation\nnear solid substrates [18, 19] and has been found to give results in qualitative agreement with simulation.\nThe external potential, representing a single cylindrical macroparticle of radius R oriented along the y axis, is given\nby\n\u0003\n\uf8f11 \u0002\n\uf8f4\n2 V0 \u0014tanh(b/w) \u2212 tanh(\u2212b/w)\n\uf8f4\n\u0015 s \u2212 R < \u2212b\n\uf8f2\n\u0010R \u2212 s\u0011\n\u2212 tanh(\u2212b/w)\n|s \u2212 R| < b\n(4)\nVext (r, u) = Vext (s, u) = 12 V0 tanh\n\uf8f4\nw\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\ns\u2212R>b\nwhere s = (x, z), s = |s|, V0 = 50kB T and w = b/5. This represents a sharply varying repulsive potential acting\non the ellipsoid centres of mass. It excludes the molecules from the cylinder and gives rise to homeotropic (normal)\nanchoring at the surface.\nAs before [20, 21, 22, 23] the angularly dependent functions are expanded in a set of spherical harmonics, and the\nassumption of translational invariance along y allows us to write the coefficients as functions of s:\nX\nlog \u03c1(r, u) =\n\u03c1\u0303lm (s)Ylm (u)\n(5a)\nl,m\n\n\u03c1(r, u) =\n\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u03c1lm (s)Ylm\n(u)\n\n(5b)\n\nX\n\nVlm (s)Ylm (u) .\n\n(5c)\n\nl,m\n\nVext (r, u) =\n\nl,m\n\nNote the complex conjugate in the density expansion. The Mayer function is expanded as [22]\nX\nf (r12 , u1 , u2 ) =\nfl1 l2 l (r12 )\u03a6l1 l2 l (r\u030212 , u1 , u2 ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nl1 ,l2 ,l\n\nwhere r12 = |r12 |, r\u030212 = r12 /r12 , and \u03a6l1 l2 l is a rotational invariant [24]. Inserting these expressions into the grand\npotential and integrating over angles and the y direction gives\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u221a\n\u03b2\u03a9[\u03c1(r, u)]\n=\nds\n\u03c1lm (s) \u03c1\u0303lm (s) \u2212 4\u03c0(1 + \u03b2\u03bc)\u03b4l0 + \u03b2Vlm (s)\nL\nl,m\nZ\nX\n+\nds1 ds2\n(7)\nLl1 m1 l2 m2 (s12 )\u03c1l1 m1 (s1 )\u03c1l2 m2 (s2 ) .\nl 1 m1\nl 2 m2\n\nHere L is the box length in the y direction (we assume periodicity). The quantities Ll1 m1 l2 m2 (s12 ) come from\nintegrating the Mayer function and are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the excluded length (in the y direction)\nof two molecules with a separation vector s12 = s1 \u2212 s2 in the xz-plane, treated as a function of the molecular\norientations. As the last term in eqn (7) is a convolution, it is most conveniently evaluated in reciprocal space. If\n\u03c1lm (k) is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of \u03c1lm (s) then this term may be written\nXX\n(8)\nLl1 m1 l2 m2 (k)\u03c1l1 m1 (k)\u03c1l2 m2 (k)\nk l 1 m1\nl 2 m2\n\nwhere Ll1 m1 l2 m2 (k) is the Fourier transform of Ll1 m1 l2 m2 (s12 ).\n\n\f3\nIn order to find the equilibrium density the functions are tabulated on a regular grid in the xz plane; the grid spacing\nis \u03b4x = \u03b4z = 0.2b, the molecular length corresponding to 25 grid points. The grand potential is then minimised with\nrespect to the \u03c1\u0303lm (s) coefficients at each grid point using the conjugate gradient method [25]. When required, the\ncoefficients \u03c1lm (s) are calculated through eqns (5), with angular integrations performed using Lebedev quadrature\n[26, 27]. The systems in studied in this work were all square boxes (Lx = Lz ) with Lx ranging from 40b (200 grid\npoints) to 100b (500 grid points).

For all R the density is largest\nat the surface but then decays away with almost periodic variation, similar to that seen for a nematic-planar wall\ninterface. Further from the cylinder this distortion in the density becomes highly anisotropic. Parallel to the director\nthe modulations in the density are stronger than in the perpendicular direction. This weakening perpendicular to the\ndirector is due to the partial melting of the nematic in the defect regions [28] and is most noticeable for the smallest\nradius R/b = 5 (Fig. 1a). In this case, there is almost no density modulation perpendicular to the director causing\nthe density map to show chevron-like structures, with the chevron tips pointing along the director away from the axis\nof the cylinder. For larger radii, the density variation perpendicular to the director is stronger, but shorter-ranged,\nthan in the direction parallel to the director. In comparison to simulation of a system with e = 3 [28], the density\nvariation seems to be shorter ranged. While this may be due to differences in the models, studies of the nematic-wall\ninterface using Onsager and related theories [18, 23] also gave density profiles that have generally weaker structure\nthan comparable simulations.\nMaps of the orientational order parameter around the cylindrical particles are shown in Fig. 2. As for the density\nmaps, the variation in the order parameter is highly anisotropic. For R/b = 5, along the director, there are lobes\nof high order along the top and bottom of the cylinder. In the direction perpendicular to the director there are two\nregions of drastically reduced order, corresponding to defects in the liquid. As R increases the lobes of increased\norder tend to wrap around the cylinder, and the defects move away from the surface, in agreement with simulation\n[28] and phenomenological theory [11, 29, 30]. While the positions of the defects are in qualitative agreement with\nprevious results, in the present case the defects are significantly smaller than those seen previously, suggesting that for\nmolecules of this elongation more sophisticated methods such as weighted density approximations [31] or fundamental\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Density maps around a cylindrical macroparticle at \u03bc = 8.0 (nematic phase).

Detailed comparisons with\nsimulation will appear in a later publication.\nAlso shown in Fig. 2 is the director orientation n(s) around the macroparticle. At large distances from the cylinder\nthe n(s) lies along the z axis. Close to the particle the director becomes highly distorted. Along the z axis and at\nthe defects n(s) is normal to the particle surface. At other points on the particle surface, n(s) points away from\nthe surface normal appearing to graze the surface of the macroparticle. This behaviour is different from that seen in\nsimulation [28] and from elastic theory in the case of strong anchoring [29], suggesting that the anchoring around the\nmacroparticle is weaker than in previous studies. Apart from in the vicinity of the defects n(s) is a smoothly varying\nfunction of s.\nIn order to gain more insight, the density and order parameter profiles parallel (\u03c1k (s) and Sk (s)) and perpendicular\n(\u03c1\u22a5 (s) and S\u22a5 (s)) to the director (through the defects) are shown in Fig. 3.

This is similar to the behaviour seen for a nematic fluid near\na wall with homeotropic alignment [20, 23]. The size of the peak at contact increases with R at small R. \u03c1\u22a5 (s) also\nhas a peak at contact. For smaller cylinders \u03c1\u22a5 (R) \u226a \u03c1k (R). As R increases the difference between the two heights\ndecreases. Further from contact \u03c1\u22a5 (s) has a secondary peak. For the R/b = 5 cylinder this peak is approximately\n2.5b from the surface with \u03c1\u22a5 (s) tending towards the bulk value further out. For larger R, the secondary peak moves\nout. Beyond this peak \u03c1\u22a5 (s) behaves almost identically for all R.\nAs with \u03c1k (s), the Sk (s) profile is similar to the order parameter profile for a nematic-homeotropic wall interface,\nwith a maximum at contact and decaying oscillations. S\u22a5 (r) shows a minimum near contact. This corresponds to the\ndefect seen in the order parameter maps (Fig. 2). In agreement with the order parameter maps, the distance between\nthe minimum and the surface increases with R. Shown in Fig. 4 is the position of the minimum smin as a function of\n\n\f7\nradius R.

In the present case smin increases with R.\nB.\n\nStructure in the isotropic phase and around the nematic-isotropic transition\n\nShown in Figs. 1d, 2d, 5 and 6 are the density and order parameter maps for a cylindrical macroparticle with\nR/b = 15 in both the nematic and isotropic phases. The bulk isotropic-nematic transition occurs at \u03bcN I = 7.3675.\nIn the nematic phase, at this value of \u03bc, the density and order parameter maps are similar to those seen for \u03bc = 8,\nthough the variation in the density and order parameter are less pronounced. Also the defects either side of the\ncylinder with \u03bc = 7.3675 are both larger and significantly further from the surface (smin \u2212 R \u2248 2.5b) than for the\nhigher chemical potential. In the isotropic phase, both the density and order parameter variation become almost\ncompletely symmetrical, reflecting the loss of a preferred direction. In this phase, far from the cylinder, the order\nparameter S \u2192 0, while both \u03c1 and S have maxima at the surface. This suggests that the surface is wet by the\nnematic and this gives rise to short range interactions between particles dispersed in a liquid crystal host even in the\nisotropic phase [9, 33]. However, a detailed investigation of surface phase behaviour and interparticle interactions in\nthis model await further study.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper the structure of a liquid of hard ellipsoids of elongation e = 5, around a cylindrical macroparticle, in\nboth the nematic and isotropic phases, was studied using density functional theory within the Onsager approximation.\nThe resulting density and order parameter maps were consistent with previous theoretical and simulation work. On\ngoing from the nematic to isotropic phase, the structure of the surrounding fluid becomes rotationally invariant about\nthe cylinder, with what appears to be a nematic wetting layer at the particle surface.\nThe present study is preliminary: investigation of the sensitivity of the results to the resolution of the real-space\nand reciprocal-space grids must still be carried out. Nonetheless, the results are very promising. Despite its simplicity,\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 5: Density maps for fluid around cylindrical macroparticle of radius R/b = 15 with (a) \u03bc = 7.3675 (nematic phase, at NI\ntransition), (b) \u03bc = 7.3675 (isotropic phase, at NI transition), and (c) \u03bc = 5.0 (isotropic phase). Dark colours show low \u03c1(s),\nlight colours high \u03c1(s).\n\nthis method provides results that are generally in agreement with simulation and phenomenological theory. The only\nmajor deficiency is that the defects are smaller than would be expected from simulations of a similar system with\ne = 3. Using more sophisticated density functionals or ellipsoids with longer elongations (where Onsager theory is\nmore accurate) would hopefully give a better description of the defect. Detailed comparisons with simulation will be\ndescribed elsewhere.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by EPSRC grant GR/S77240.
