By carefully\nchoosing grating parameters such as grating thickness and spacing, a three-port beam splitter operation for\ncold neutrons \u2013 splitting the incident neutron intensity equally into the \u00b11st and 0th diffraction orders \u2013 was\nrealized. As a possible application, a Zernike three-path interferometer is briefly discussed.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.Be, 82.35.Np, 42.40.Eq\nKeywords: Neutron optics, Nanoparticles in polymers, Holographic gratings\nSince almost 40 years, neutron interferometers for\nthermal neutrons have played an important role in\ninvestigations of fundamental physics1,2 . The classic\nMach-Zehnder geometry of the most successful perfectcrystal interferometers was also implemented using artificial structures, such as Ni gratings in reflection geometry combined with mirrors3, or thin quartz glass\nphase gratings for very-cold neutron interferometry4 .\nMultilayer-mirrors have been employed for cold neutron\ninterferometry5 . Gaining ground also as a tool in materials science, neutron interferometers are increasingly\nadopted for neutron phase-imaging and tomography6.\nMany interesting effects of fundamental interest that \u2013\ndue to their subtle nature \u2013 are yet to be observed experimentally, can be investigated using neutron interferometers (see, for instance, Refs. 1, 7). In some cases, the\nrather small expected phase shifts can be enhanced by extending the interaction time of neutrons with the particular optical potential \u2013 materials or magnetic- and electricfields in one of the interferometer paths \u2013 needed to probe\na certain effect. Longer interaction times are achieved by\nenlarging the potential region and/or using slow neutrons\nwith long de-Broglie wavelength. While the former is often difficult to realize for technical reasons or simply due\nto lack of space, the latter comes at the cost of neutron\nflux with today's neutron sources. Provided that efficient\nneutron-optical devices \u2013 mirrors and beam splitters \u2013 exist to avoid abolishing the advantage of slow-neutron interferometry by lack of intensity, cold and very-cold neutrons (0.5 > \u03bb > 10nm) can offer a fair trade-off between\nneutron flux and interaction time. Mach-Zehnder interferometers for cold neutrons, based on holographic poly\n(methyl methacrylate) diffraction gratings, were tested\nin the past8 . Only recently, it has been shown that\n\na) juergen.klepp@univie.ac.at;\n\nhttp://fun.univie.ac.at\n\nFIG. 1. Sketch of the experimental setup.\n\nholographic nanoparticle-polymer diffraction gratings are\nwell suited for use as optical components in neutron interferometry. Such beam splitters9,10 and free-standing film\nmirrors11 exhibit diffraction in the Bragg regime (twowave regime) so that no intensity is wasted to undesired\ndiffraction orders. In this Letter, a holographic SiO2\nnanoparticle-polymer neutron diffraction grating is presented that acts as a three-port beam splitter for cold\nneutrons at wavelength \u03bb = 1.7nm, i.e. the incident\nbeam is coherently split into three beams of equal intensity.\nHolographic gratings are produced by using a conventional holography setup. Coherent plane-wave signal and\nreference light-beams are superposed enclosing a certain\ncrossing angle at the position of the recording material. Upon illumination with the resulting sinusoidal spatial light pattern, a sinusoidal neutron refractive-index\nmodulation occurs in the recording material. It is proportional to the modulation of the coherent scattering\nlength density bc \u2206\u03c1. Such a holographic grating is described by the periodically modulated refractive index\n\n\f2\nn(x) = n + \u2206n cos (2\u03c0x/\u039b). Here, \u2206n = \u03bb2 bc \u2206\u03c1/(2\u03c0)\nand \u039b are the refractive-index modulation amplitude and\nthe grating spacing, respectively. The quantities bc and\n\u2206\u03c1 are the coherent nuclear scattering length of the material and the number density modulation of the hologram, respectively.\nInorganic nanoparticles embedded in a photopolymer\nmatrix (nanoparticle-polymer composites) have already\nbeen investigated12 for light-optics applications. A particular advantage of nanoparticle-polymer gratings \u2013 expected to boost their impact on neutron optics \u2013 is the\npossibility to tune the refractive-index modulation \u2206n\nby choosing a suitable value of bc , i.e. the species of\nnanoparticles. At the moment, a drawback is that due\nto detrimental holographic light-scattering in such thick\ncomposite films possessing large \u2206n during recording,\n\u2206n is reduced along the sample depth. As a result,\ngrating thickness may be limited to the order of 100 microns, which is too small for reaching 50% or 100% reflectivity for cold and very-cold neutrons. Fortunately,\noptical elements are still feasible by exploiting the socalled Pendell\u00f6sung interference effect predicted by dynamical diffraction theory1 : due to superposition of two\nneutron waves formed in the periodic potential of crystals and also holographic gratings, the output neutron\nintensity is swapped back and forth between diffracted\nand forward-diffracted (transmitted) beams, depending\non the thickness13 of the sample and the incident neutron\nwavelength14 . Thus, crystals or gratings can be tilted\naround an axis parallel to the grating vector15 , thereby\nchanging the effective thickness. This allows to control\nthe diffraction efficiency (reflectivity) to some extent10 .\nThe SiO2 nanoparticles used for the present studies\nhave an average core diameter of about 13 nm. They\nwere produced by liquid-phase synthesis and dissolved\nin a methyl isobutyl ketone solution. The SiO2 sol was\ndispersed to methacrylate monomer. The nanoparticle\nconcentration was 20 vol%. As radical photoinitiator,\n1wt.% titanocene (Irgacure784, Ciba) was added to enable the monomer to photo-polymerize at wavelengths\nshorter than 550 nm. The mixed syrup was cast on a\n100-\u03bcm spacer-loaded glass plate and dried. Then the\nsample was covered with another glass plate to obtain\na nanoparticle-monomer film. Note that, prior to holographic recording, the photoinitiator, the monomer and\nthe nanoparticles were homogeneously mixed in the sample material. Two expanded, mutually coherent and spolarized laser beams at a wavelength of 532nm were\nsuperposed at a crossing angle of about 30\u25e6 to create a\nspatially sinusoidal light-intensity pattern with a grating\nspacing of \u039b = 1 \u03bcm in the sample. The beam diameter was about 1 cm. The light pattern induced polymerization in the bright sample regions, a process that\nconsumes monomers. As a consequence of the growing\nmonomer-concentration gradient, nanoparticles counterdiffused from bright to dark regions12 . This results in\nan approximately sinusoidal nanoparticle-concentration\npattern. Homogeneous illumination after recording was\n\nFIG. 2. Rocking curve measured at wavelength \u03bb = 1.7nm\nand grating tilt angle \u03b6 = 56\u25e6 . At \u03b8 = 0, the intensities of\n\u00b11st and 0th diffraction orders are approximately equal and\nthe grating acts as a three-port beam splitter.\n\nmade in order that the sample was fully polymerized\nand the nanoparticle density-modulation was fixed. It\nis found that similar samples stored under ambient conditions have not changed their light-diffraction properties\nfor at least 7 years.\nNeutron diffraction by such gratings was investigated\nat the instrument SANS I of the SINQ spallation source\nat the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland. The measurement principle is sketched in Fig. 1.\nThe gratings were mounted in transmission geometry.\nTilting the gratings to the angle \u03b6 around an axis parallel to the grating vector \u2013 in order to adjust the effective thickness \u2013 the incident angle \u03b8 was varied to measure rocking curves in the vicinity of the Bragg angle\n\u03b8B . The neutron wavelength distribution of the incident\nbeam is typically 10%. The collimation-slit width and\ndistance were chosen so that the beam divergence was\nabout 1mrad. We defined the diffraction efficiency of\nthe ith diffraction order as \u03b7i = Ii /Itot , where Ii and\nItot are the measured intensities of the ith diffraction order and the total intensity of transmitted and diffracted\nbeams, respectively. For each incident angle \u03b8, the sum\nover all 2D-detector pixels in each separated diffraction\nspot (see Fig. 1) \u2013 associated to one diffraction order \u2013\nwas calculated and the obtained intensities (corrected for\nbackground) plugged into the above equation for \u03b7i . The\nresulting rocking curve is plotted in Fig. 2. Here, the incident neutron wavelength was \u03bb = 1.7nm and \u03b6 = 56\u25e6 .\nAt this tilt angle, the effective thickness of the grating\nis about 163 microns. Note that in addition to the \u00b11st\ndiffraction orders, the \u00b12nd diffraction orders are clearly\nvisible. However, at \u03b8 = 0, the \u00b12nd diffraction orders\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3. (a) Sketch of a Zernike interferometer for very-cold\nneutrons with three-port beam splitter (3P-BS), and symmetrically slanted mirror grating (M). (b) Close-up of the\nexpected interference pattern. Introducing a sample on the\ncentral beam, the intensity pattern is shifted along the z direction, which results in a variation of peak intensities at the\ndetection plane D, where the highest sensitivity is achieved.\n\ndecrease to \u03b7\u00b12 \u2243 0.06, while the \u00b11st and 0th orders exhibit approximately the same values of about 0.3 . Thus,\napart from negligible losses to the \u00b12nd diffraction orders,\nat normal incidence angle the incoming neutron wave is\ncoherently split into three separated beams of equal intensity. The grating acts as a three-port beam splitter\nwith overall efficiency \u03b7\u22121 + \u03b70 + \u03b7+1 of almost 0.9, which\nis close to the theoretical upper bound of about 0.9316 .\nA three-port beam splitter could be the central\nbuilding-block of a Zernike three-path interferometer17\nfor very-cold neutrons, as sketched in Fig. 3(a). Choosing suitable intensity ratios and phase relations between\nthe three beams results in a neutron interference pattern with periodicity \u03bb/(2 sin \u03b1) in x direction, where\n2\u03b1 is the angle enclosed by the \u00b11st order beams superposed at the detection plane [marked 'D' in Fig. 3(a)].\nAn additional phase shift introduced on the central beam\nmanifests as a shift of the interference pattern along the\noptical axis (z direction) rather than a lateral shift of\nfringes. At the detection plane D, the introduced phase\nshift can be extracted from the resulting change of peak\nintensities of the observed pattern. To avoid aberration\neffects, recombination of the neutron beams at D can\nbe achieved by using diffraction gratings as mirrors11\n[marked 'M' in Fig. 3(a)]. For the periodicity of the interference pattern in x direction to be large enough for\ndetection, two symmetrically slanted mirror-gratings can\nbe recorded in one single nanoparticle-polymer composite sample in order to decrease the angle 2\u03b1. Suppose\nwe require to maintain at least 1 cm separation between\nthe three beams (of 1 mm width, say) at point M to conveniently insert a sample into the central beam. From\ngeometrical considerations, it is found that for an incident neutron wavelength of \u03bb = 8nm and a three-port\nbeam splitter with a grating spacing of \u039b = 0.5\u03bcm, the\ninterference pattern formed along the x direction at D can\nhave a periodicity of 1\u03bcm at a beam splitter-to-detector\ndistance of about 3.75m. The pattern is spread 25cm\nalong the optical axis and at most 1mm along the x direction. A close-up of the expected intensity pattern is\nshown in Fig. 3(b). It can be observed by scanning the\n\nx position of an absorption grating at D in front of a\nneutron detector. Neutron-absorption gratings of sufficiently small periodicity can already be produced by inclined sidewall evaporation of Gd on a Si grating18 or\nby holographic recording of CdSe nanoparticle-polymer\ngratings19, for instance. Note that \u2013 for the given experimental parameters \u2013 a phase shift as small as \u03bb/100\nintroduced on the central beam is transferred to a spatial\nshift of the intensity pattern along the z direction as large\nas 10 \u03bcm. Also, we do not expect overly stringent requirements for grating adjustment and beam collimation\nbecause nanoparticle-polymer composite gratings feature\nan angular selectivity \u2013 approximately given by the width\nof the rocking curve \u039b/d \u2013 that is reduced by about one\norder of magnitude as compared to the gratings for the\ninterferometers described in Refs. 8.\nTo conclude, we have demonstrated the implementation of a holographic SiO2 nanoparticle-polymer composite grating as a three-port beam splitter for cold neutrons.\nAs an example, we have briefly discussed its application\nin a Zernike three-path interferometer. Next to reaching\nhigh phase-sensitivity, such an instrument could also be\nused in a precision test of Born's rule20 for matter-waves.\nFinancial support by the Austrian Science Fund\n(FWF): P-20265, and by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grant\nNo. 23656045) is greatly acknowledged.\n1 H.\n\nRauch and S.
