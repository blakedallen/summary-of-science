For the chain of He isotopes we demonstrate the agreement of theoretical results with recent\nexperimental data. We show how the interplay of internal collectivity and coherent coupling to continuum gives rise to the\nuniversal mechanism of creating pigmy giant resonances.\n\nCONTINUUM SHELL MODEL\nRecent progress in physics of weakly bound nuclei and other marginally stable mesoscopic systems requires an\nadequate many-body theory which would combine the bound states and continuum in a consistent description. Below\nwe show how it can be done. Our formalism of continuum shell model (CSM) follows closely the projection method\nby Feshbach [1]. The many-body states of the system are separated into subspaces P and Q, and the Hamiltonian\nconsists of three parts, H = HQQ + HPP + HPQ . The internal space P contains shell model (SM) states with all particles\non bound single-particle orbitals, for example N-nucleon m-scheme Slater determinants, labelled as |1i. The external\nspace Q contains all states |c; Ei, labelled by energy E and channel c, with some particles in the continuum. These wave\nfunctions asymptotically behave as outgoing spherical (Coulomb) waves with respect to one or several single-particle\narguments. We solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation H|\u03b1 ; Ei = E|\u03b1 ; Ei within the total P + Q space where an eigenstate \u03b1\nis a superposition\nZ\n|\u03b1 ; Ei = \u2211 \u03b11 (E)|1i + \u2211\nc\n\n1\n\ndE \u2032 \u03b1c (E \u2032 ; E)|c; E \u2032 i,\n\n(1)\n\nElimination of external states leads to the effective energy-dependent Hamiltonian that acts within P space,\ni\nH (E) = HPP + \u2206(E) \u2212 W (E) .\n2\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u2206(E) is a self-energy term coming from virtual excitations into the continuum and W (E) stands for the explicitly\nnon-Hermitian term due to the open decay channels,\nh1|\u2206(E)|2i = \u2211 P\nc\n\nZ\n\ndE \u2032\n\nAc1 (E \u2032 )\u2217 Ac2 (E \u2032 )\n,\nE \u2212 E\u2032\n\nh1|W (E)|2i = 2\u03c0\n\n\u2211\n\nAc1 (E)\u2217 Ac2 (E).\n\n(3)\n\nc (open)\n\nThe amplitude of coupling to the continuum, Ac1 (E), is introduced as Ac1 (E) = hc; E|HQP |1i . For Eqs. (3) it is assumed\nfor simplicity that the P and Q spaces are orthogonal, and that for the continuum HQQ |c; Ei = E|c; Ei. Thus, given the\neffective Hamiltonian (2), the internal solution can be found as\n\n\u2211 H12 (E)\u03b12 (E) = E \u03b11 (E),\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fthen, using the internal amplitudes \u03b11 (E), the continuum part can be restored as\n\n\u03b1c (E \u2032 ; E) = \u2211 \u03b11 (E)\n1\n\nAc1 (E \u2032 )\n.\nE \u2212 E \u2032 + i0\n\n(5)\n\nThe energy dependence of the effective Hamiltonian (2) in this formalism emphasizes the non-exponential nature of\ndecay processes. The experimental observables can be found through the scattering matrix that is expressed via the\nsame Hamiltonian:\n(\n)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nc\u2032\ncc\u2032\nc\u2217\ncc\u2032\nA (E) exp(i\u03bec\u2032 ),\nS (E) = exp(i\u03bec ) \u03b4 \u2212 \u2211 A1 (E)\n(6)\nE \u2212 H (E) 12 2\n12\nwhere \u03bec is a smooth scattering phase in channel c coming from features not accounted in the model Hamiltonian.\nEquation (4) has no solutions with real eigenvalues E . This is not surprising since stationary intrinsic states cannot\nbe matched by outgoing continuum states in Eq. (1). However, solutions do exist in the complex energy plane E \u2192 E\nas Gamow quasistationary states [2], where resonance energies are taken as Eres = Re(E ) and widths are identified\nas \u0393res = \u22122Im(E ). The related non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem is discussed in [3, 4, 5]. This solution for the\nresonance lies in the foundation of the alternative approach, so-called Gamow Shell Model [6], where the solution\nof the non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem finds poles of the scattering matrix (6). The realization of this approach,\nalthough well formulated mathematically, is complicated by the difficulty of analytical continuation into the complex\nplane. In general, the direct solution of Eq. (4) leads to numerous unphysical roots [7], unless cuts in the complex\nmomentum space are made that separate physical and unphysical regions. The Breit-Wigner formalism gives an\nalternative definition of a resonance [8], while avoiding transition into the complex energy plain. Here both effective\nHamiltonian and scattering matrix are evaluated only on the real energy axis. The resonance energy is determined\nfrom the condition that real part in the denominator of scattering matrix vanishes which is equivalent to finding Eres\nas Eres = Re(E ), where E = Eres \u2212 (i/2)\u0393res is a complex eigenvalue of H (Eres ). There is yet another definition of a\nresonance that is closely related to the experimental cross section when, from a phase shift \u03b4 in a given channel, the\nresonance width is defined as the phase shift derivative which at the resonance produces the maximum time delay \u03c4 ,\n\n\u03c4=\n\n2\nd \u03b4 (E)\n=\n\u0393\ndE\n\n,\nE=Eres\n\nd 2 \u03b4l (E)\ndE 2\n\n= 0.\n\n(7)\n\nE=Eres\n\nHaving defined the resonance region as the energy region of size \u0393 around the resonance energy, all of the above\ndefinitions agree if the two conditions are fulfilled: (1) the resonance regions do not overlap; (2) the energy dependence\nof the effective Hamiltonian in each of the resonance regions is weak and can be ignored. In the realistic cases, when\nthe density of states is high and these conditions are violated, one has to be specific and identify the definition of\nresonances and widths. In this work we use a Breit-Wigner definition for the width. It is also important that the CSM\ncan be used for calculating the cross sections which leads to direct comparison with experiment. In that case, in contrast\nto a traditional SM, the large-scale matrix diagonalization is substituted by the matrix inversion needed for Eq. (6).\n\nAPPLICATION TO WEAKLY-BOUND NUCLEI\nIn the following application of the CSM we assume that the Hermitian part of the effective Hamiltonian HPP + \u2206\nis given by the phenomenological SM Hamiltonian and limit Q-space to one and two particles in the continuum.\nPhenomenologically adjusted interactions include corrections from virtual excitations to the continuum \u2206. Energy\ndependence of \u2206(E) is ignored since, unlike the non-Hermitian term W , \u2206 is not sensitive to thresholds. This choice of\nthe interaction assures that, for the states below decay thresholds, coupling to continuum disappears, W = 0, and the\nresults of the conventional SM are exactly reproduced.\nWe assume that the mean field Hamiltonian selected here as a Woods-Saxon potential is responsible for singleparticle widths while the additional schematic two-body interaction discussed below is introduced in HPQ to mediate\ndirect two-body decay processes. With b\u2020 (\u03b5 ) defined as a single-particle creation operator in the continuum state with\nenergy \u03b5 , a one-particle channel with quantum numbers j, energy of the particle \u03b5 j , and the residual nucleus in the\nstate |\u03b1 ; N \u2212 1i, so that E = E\u03b1 + \u03b5 j , is asymptotically labelled as |ci = b\u2020j (\u03b5 j )|\u03b1 ; N \u2212 1i. The two-body channel\n\n\fcan be expressed similarly, |ci = b\u2020j (\u03b5 )b\u2020j\u2032 (\u03b5 \u2032 )|\u03b1 ; N \u2212 2i. The first contribution from the continuum comes through a\nsingle-particle decay amplitude\nAc1 (E\u03b1 + \u03b5 j ) = \u2211 a\u03bdj (\u03b5 j ) h\u03b1 ; N \u2212 1|b\u03bd |1; Ni,\n(8)\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the reduced single-particle amplitudes are\na\u03bd (\u03b5 ) = h0|b\u03bd (\u03b5 ) HPQ b\u2020j |0i,\nj\n\n(9)\n\nand the operators b\u2020\u03bd create particles on the discrete SM orbitals. If the valence space is small, each single-particle state\n\u03bd is uniquely identified by spin-isospin quantum numbers j. As a result, the contribution to the effective Hamiltonian\nfrom one-body decay is\n(10)\nh1|W (E)|2i = 2\u03c0\u03b412 \u2211 |a j (\u03b5 j )|2 |h\u03b1 ; N \u2212 1|b j |1; Ni|2 ,\nc (open)\n\nwhere E = \u03b5 j + E\u03b1 .\nBeing in general a many-body operator, W is effectively reduced to a single-particle form in some important cases.\nFor example, far from thresholds one can ignore the energy dependence and use the closure to simplify the summation\nin (10),\nh1|W (E)|2i = 2\u03c0\u03b412 \u2211 |a j |2 |h1; N|b\u2020j b j |1; Ni|2 .\n(11)\nj\n\n2\n\nW than becomes a one-body operator that assigns a width \u03b3 j = 2\u03c0 a j to each unstable single-particle state j = \u03bd and\ncan be combined with the shell model Hamiltonian via complex single-particle energies e\u03bd = \u03b5\u03bd \u2212 i\u03b3\u03bd /2. The singleparticle interpretation of the width is possible when the decay process is not associated with a significant change in the\nstructure from parent to daughter nucleus. The coupling amplitude a j (\u03b5 ), Eq. (9), is calculated numerically through a\none-nucleon scattering problem. Within few MeV above decay thresholds, the energy-dependence of a j (\u03b5 ) to a good\naccuracy can be parameterized by the power law consistent with the energy scaling of the width as \u0393(\u03b5 ) \u223c \u03b5 l+1/2\nwhere \u03b5 is the energy above the threshold and l is the partial wave of the decay channel.\nWith the one-body interaction used for single-particle decays, the admixture from the two-particle continuum can\nonly appear as a second order contribution,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u03b1 |b j |\u03b2 i h\u03b2 |b j\u2032 |1i h\u03b1 |b j\u2032 |\u03b2 i h\u03b2 |b j |1i\n\u2032\n,\n(12)\nAc1 (E) = \u2211 a j (\u03b5 )a j (\u03b5 \u2032 )\n+\nE \u2212 E\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5\nE \u2212 E\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2032\n\u03b2\nthat proceeds through an intermediate state \u03b2 of the nucleus with N \u2212 1 particles (sequential two-body decay). The\ncontribution from this decay to matrix W is\nh1|W (E)|2i = 2\u03c0\n\n\u2211\u2032\n\n\u03b1 , j, j\n\nZ\n\nd \u03b5 d \u03b5 \u2032 \u03b4 (E \u2212 E\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2032 ) Ac1 (E)\u2217 Ac2 (E) .\n\n(13)\n\nThe integration over single-particle energies may contain poles corresponding to open one-body decays. We concentrate here on the principal value part that represents off-shell processes. Eqs. (12) and (13) allow for additional\n\u2032\nsimplifications in the near-threshold region. The overall width behaves as \u0393 \u223c Ek2+l+l where Ek is the total available\nkinetic energy.\nIn contrast to sequential decay, the amplitude for the direct two-body transition is mediated by the two-body\ninteraction in the HPQ part of the Hamiltonian. To describe this process, a pair amplitude is introduced,\nAc1 (E) = a(L) (\u03b51 , \u03b52 ) h\u03b1 ; N \u2212 2|pL |1; Ni ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the operator pL = {b\u03bd \u2297 b\u03bd \u2032 }L removes a pair coupled to quantum numbers L. Unlike in the sequential case,\ndirect pair emission conserves only the quantum numbers of the pair. Near thresholds we parameterize direct decay\namplitude a(L) (\u03b51 , \u03b52 ) with the appropriate energy dependence that reflects the phase space kinematics of the free-body\nfinal state.\nAs an example, we consider the p-shell chain of helium isotopes from 4 He to 10 He. The internal space consists\nof two single-particle levels, p3/2 and p1/2 . The SM interaction and single-particle energies are defined in [9, 10].\n\n\fFIGURE 1. CSM calculation for He isotopes. For each isotope, the CSM result is on the left and experimental value is on the\nright, energy of each state or resonance is not shown but the energy scale is given on the vertical axis. For each state spin, parity\nand the decay width in MeV are displayed.\n\nFor the one-body part of HQQ and HPQ we use the Woods-Saxon potential adjusted for single-particle states in 5 He.\nEven at several MeV above threshold, the single-particle widths for the p-wave decay from p3/2 and p1/2 levels to a\ngood accuracy can be described by the parameterizations \u03b33/2 (\u03b5 ) = 0.608\u03b5 3/2 and \u03b31/2 (\u03b5 ) = 0.3652\u03b5 3/2 (all energies\nin MeV). The sequential two-body decay is computed using Eq. (12) with the near-threshold approximation and the\nabove assumption for the energy dependence of single-particle amplitudes. The calculation with just one-body part in\nHPQ is inadequate emphasizing the need for the direct two-body decay. This decay is introduced only for pair emission\nwith total angular momentum L = 0. It is assumed that all L = 0 neutron pairs couple\nto the continuum with the same\n\u221a\ndecay amplitude a(L=0) (\u03b51 , \u03b52 ) parameterized as a(L=0) (\u03b51 , \u03b52 ) = |\u03b51 + \u03b52 |/(3.0 2\u03c0 ). The numerical constant 3.0, the\nonly parameter of the model, is introduced to describe the unknown strength of the residual two-body interaction\nneeded for two-body decay of 6 He. With parameters of the model being identified, the full solution proceeds along\nthe chain of isotopes starting from 4 He, so that at each step the relevant states in the daughter systems are known. For\neach state in an N-particle system, the solution is iterative, energy E is used to determine possible open decay modes\ninto N \u2212 1 and N \u2212 2 daughters, then the non-Hermitian part W (E) is constructed, and the full effective Hamiltonian is\ndiagonalized leading to a new complex energy eigenvalue. For each state in the system this procedure is repeated until\nconvergence.\nFigure 1 shows the level scheme obtained with the CSM calculation for He isotopes along with experimental data.\nBeyond good overall agreement, additional fine details can be noted that are in close relation to recent experimental\n4\ndata [11, 12, 13]. For 6 He the 2+\n1 state is well described by the sequential two-body decay into He. However, the\n+\ndescription of the broad first excited 0 state requires direct two-body decay, in agreement with the coherent L = 0\npair-excitation structure of that state [14]. For 7 He, the CSM confirms the peculiar nature of the 5/2\u2212 state noticed in\nthe experiment [11]: this state decays to the excited 2+ state rather than to the ground state of 6 He. This is not the case\nfor the neighboring state 1/2\u2212 that mainly decays to the ground state. Theory and very recent experimental results\n[13] are in good agreement regarding spectroscopic factors and branching ratios. Additional CSM studies of realistic\nnuclear cases (the chain of oxygen isotopes) and related discussions can be found in Ref. [15].\n\n\fThe drawing schematically shows the spectrum\nof particle-hole excitations on the right. Due to\nmultipole interaction, the giant collective state\n(GR) is repelled up in energy. At the same\ntime, coupling to the common particle continuum creates super-radiant (SR) collectivity\nvisible through the particle scattering reaction.\nThe cross section of such a reaction is sketched\non the left. Factorized forms of the real interaction and of the coupling to continuum assure\ncollectivity in both GR and decay modes. The\ndynamics are determined by two multidimensional vectors d = {dn } and A = {An }, see text.\nThe multipole interaction shifts the GR accumulating the multipole strength by \u03a9 = \u03bb d2\nalong the real energy axis from the unperturbed\ncentroid \u03b5\u0304 . The continuum interaction shifts the\nSR state accumulating the decay width along\nthe imaginary energy axis.\nFIGURE 2.\n\nLOW ENERGY BRANCH OF GIANT RESONANCE\nThe CSM presented here combines structure and reaction physics on the level that goes beyond any perturbative\ntreatment; the unitarity of the scattering matrix is fulfilled automatically. The interesting effects related to the nature\nof many-body states embedded in the continuum can be noted in the above example of He isotopes. Compared to the\nconventional SM, the centroids of low-lying decaying states are shifted into continuum, see Ref. [15]; in addition, the\ncoupling to the continuum affects mixing of states and their spectroscopic factors.\nIt was first noted by Dicke [16] that strong coupling of two-level atoms to a common radiation field creates\nsuperradiant (SR) coherence. The phase transition to the superradiant regime was found to be a universal phenomenon\nin systems with overlapping resonances ranging in nature from molecular [17, 18, 19, 20] to hadronic (pentaquark\n[21]). The universality of the SR mechanism [22] comes from the factorizable nature of continuum coupling in Eq.\n(3). With a few continuum channels, the rank of the matrix W is much smaller than the dimension of the intrinsic\nspace. Strong coupling to continuum reorganizes the system in favor of creation of few SR states while the remaining\nstates become long-lived being nearly orthogonal to decay.\nGiant resonance (GR) in the response function of the nucleus to a multipole excitation appears as a result of the\ncoherent coupling of particle-hole excitations. In many cases excitation energies of particle-hole configurations lie\nabove the particle separation energy which may lead to another collectivization towards particle emission. We address\nthis interplay in the simplified example [23, 24] assuming the effective Hamiltonian\ni\nH12 = \u03b51 \u03b412 + \u03bb d1d2 \u2212 A1 A2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nthat contains unperturbed energies, real multipole interaction and interaction through the continuum, see Fig. 2 and the\ncaption for additional discussion. The interplay of the collective effects depends on the \"angle\" \u03c6 between the vectors\nd and A. In the degenerate case, \u03b5n = \u03b5 , the reaction amplitude is\nT (E) =\n\n(E \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03a9)\u0393 + \u03bb (A * d)2\n.\n(E \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03a9)[E \u2212 \u03b5 + (i/2)\u0393] + (i/2)\u03bb (A * d)2\n\n(16)\n\nIn the limits of parallel internal and external couplings, \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 , the SR and GR collectivizations are coherent, and\nthe experiment will reveal the shifted \"Giant Dicke resonance\" with full strength and full width \u0393 = A2 . This is the case\nwhen particle scattering would be most efficient in excitation of the GR. The opposite case of orthogonal couplings,\n\u03c6 = 90\u25e6 , will result in a dark collective state with no access to the continuum. Fig. 3 shows a numerical calculation for\nnon-degenerate intrinsic states when the strength and the width are both shared between the displaced GR and the SR\n\n\fFIGURE 3.\n\nParticle scattering cross section showing the excitation of GR for different angles between GR and SR collectivities.\n\nin the region of unperturbed excitation energies. With the increasing angle \u03c6 the coupling with continuum becomes\nmore fragmented and less effective in driving the GR; the missing strength develops a low-energy branch revealing the\nuniversal mechanism for creating the so-called pigmy giant resonance.\n\nFINAL NOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe emphasized some of the very recent developments along the road from the nuclear structure and stable nuclei\nto nuclear reactions and continuum. We were able to highlight only a handful of examples and techniques, a tiny\npart of a huge modern-day effort. The main message is that the CSM today is no longer a theoretical concept, it is\na powerful practical tool capable of describing many-body systems on the border of stability with an impressive quality.\nThe authors acknowledge support from the U.
