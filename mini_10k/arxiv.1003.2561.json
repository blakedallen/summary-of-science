Fermi Surfaces (FS) in phases with different\ndoping and/or periodicities reveal the influence of the RS potential on the electronic structure. We\nshow that these RS potentials are well ordered, even in incommensurate phases, where STM\nimages reveal broad stripes with width as large as 80\u00c5. The anomalous evolution of the FS area at\nlow dopings is consistent with the localization of a fraction of the electrons. We propose that this\nis a new form of electronic ordering, induced by the potential of the stacked layers (RS or Na in\nNaxCoO2) when the FS becomes smaller than the Brillouin Zone of the stacked structure.\n\nIn the past decades, many intriguing electronic\nproperties have been discovered in layered systems\nrather than in systems with strictly three dimensional\nstructures. This is often attributed to enhanced quantum\neffects in low dimensions - two dimensions (2D) for\nlayered systems - that may give rise to original\nphenomena. In such systems, there is usually a metallic\nplane (or slab) that is considered as the active unit,\nstacked with passive structures that mainly act as charge\nreservoirs. Recently, this view was challenged by an\nARPES study of one misfit cobaltate [1], which rather\nproposes a covalent bonding across the interface\nbetween the two types of units. Such questions may also\nbe relevant to address the unexpected properties recently\nobserved at interfaces between two oxides, like\nsuperconductivity at the interface between two insulators\n[2]. Cobaltates offer interesting possibilities to study\nthese questions, because they stack planes with different,\nsometimes incommensurate, periodicities. It is believed\nthat the influence between the layers could go far beyond\na simple transfer of charges [29]. In this paper, we study\nwith ARPES the development of the metallic structure\nunder these two competing potentials in 4 different\nmisfit cobaltates, where both the relative periodicities of\nstacked planes and the number of transferred electrons\nbetween them can be changed. We show that it gives rise\nto new forms of electronic orderings, characterized by a\nlocalization of a fraction of the electrons with structures\ndetermined by that of the neighboring plane.\nIn layered cobaltates, the active unit is a CoO2 slab,\n\nformed by a triangular array of Co, embedded in edgesharing oxygen octahedra. The charge reservoirs are\neither Na layers in NaxCoO2 [3] or rock-salt (RS) layers\nin misfit cobaltates [4]. They may transfer x electrons to\nthe CoO2 slab, yielding an average valence (4-x) per Co,\nhence (1-x) holes in the three t2g bands. In Na cobaltates,\nNMR has revealed that Na may induce partial charge\nlocalization in the CoO2 planes, with a periodicity\nrelated to the Na order. At x=2/3, for example, the Co\nsites located directly underneath a Na trap an electron\nand become Co3+, while the other sites form a metallic\nkagom\u00e9 lattice of Co3.5+ sites [5]. This is a proof that the\ntwo sub-systems cannot be treated as independent.\nFurthermore, there is an intriguing evolution of the\nelectronic properties, concomitant with the appearance\nof charge localization at x>0.6 [6]. The effective mass\nincreases, strong magnetic correlations develop and the\nthermoelectric power (TEP) is unusually high for a metal\n[7,8]. It was proposed that the charge ordering induced\nby Na could be a source of correlation in this limit [29],\nbut there is not definite understanding of their exact\nrelationship. In this context, it is particularly interesting\nto study CoO2 slabs in a different 3D environment, as in\nmisfit cobaltates. Our study is organized in three parts.\nFirst, we show that ARPES detects replica of the Fermi\nSurface (FS) with the periodicity of the RS, both in\ncommensurate and incommensurate phases. This implies\nthat the metallic carriers of the CoO2 slabs do sense the\nRS potential, but this does not require a covalent\nbonding between the two units, as suggested in [1].\n\n1\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1 : FS measured at SIS beamline in BiBa (a) and Bi0.7Pb0.3Sr (b) with 100eV photon energy and a temperature of 20K. Thick\nred lines correspond to CoO2 BZ and thin blue lines to RS BZ. In Bi0.7Pb0.3Sr, where the RS and CoO2 slabs are incommensurate,\ntwo sets of RS BZ are shown centered at \u03931 (solid blue lines) or \u03933 (dotted blue lines).\n\nSecond, we detail the form of the RS potential. We show\nthat, surprisingly, it presents strong analogies with that of\na Na layer, which suggests the possibility of similar\ncharge localization effects. We further show with STM\nthat, even in incommensurate phases, long range\nstructural orderings are obtained, with super-cells as\nlarge as 80\u00c5. Third, we deduce from the FS area the\nnumber of metallic carriers in different misfit\ncompounds. We show that it deviates from the expected\nstoichiometry at high x, in a way similar to NaxCoO2 [9]\nand consistent with progressive charge localization.\nTaken together, these three observations support the idea\nthat charge ordering is strongly favored in CoO2 slabs at\nhigh x and adopt a structure dictated by the potential of\nneighboring planes. We finally discuss the influence of\nthese orders on the metallic properties, in relation with\nthe progressive metal-insulator transition observed at\nhigh x in misfits [4], but not in Na cobaltates [10].\nOur single crystals were prepared by a standard\nflux method [11] and characterized by structural,\nmagnetic and transport measurements [12]. The general\nformula of misfit cobaltates is [(AO)p(BO)q]RS.[CoO2]m,\nabbreviated in the following as AB, where the first\nbracket describes the ideal composition of the RS block\nand m=b1/b2 is the misfit ratio (b2=2.82\u00c5 is the side of\nthe triangular lattice, the in-plane RS parameters are\na= 3 b2 and b1, see Fig. 2). The number of electrons in\nCoO2 planes is defined by the composition of the RS\nblock, but is difficult to estimate a priori, because of\nfrequent vacancies and substitutions in the RS. Bobroff\net al. realized that the TEP value at 300K (S300) scales\nwith x in NaxCoO2 and that this scale offers a convenient\nand reliable way to estimate x also in misfit cobaltates\n[13]. We adopt this scale to evaluate the doping, giving\n\nxS=[250+S300]/500. ARPES measurements were carried\nout at the SIS beamline of the Swiss Light Source, the\nAPE beamline of ELETTRA and the CASSIOPEE\nbeamline of SOLEIL, with typical energy resolution of\n15meV and angular resolution of 0.2\u00b0. The STM\nmeasurement was performed at the SOLEIL surface\nlaboratory with an Omicron setup.\nFig. 1 presents FS measured in two of the most\nmetallic misfit cobaltates, the nearly commensurate BiBa\n(m=1.98, xS=0.7) [14] and the strongly incommensurate\n(Bi0.7Pb0.3)Sr (m=1.75, xS=0.71) [12]. We already\nreported a FS map for BiBa in ref. [4], but, to our\nknowledge, Fig. 1b is the first report of a FS in an\nincommensurate misfit cobaltate. The BZ of the\ntriangular CoO2 slab is shown as thick red hexagons and\nthat of the RS planes as thin blue rectangles. In both\ncases, only the a1g Co band crosses the Fermi Level (FL),\ngiving rise to a hole-like hexagonal FS around \u0393,\nsketched as thin red line\uf02e\uf020. Similar hexagons are observed\nin the second CoO2 BZ (centered at \u03932 or \u03933), meaning\nthat the FS possesses the periodicity of the CoO2 slab.\nHowever, Fig. 1 shows that one can further detect\nreplicas of these main hexagons, shown as dotted blue\nhexagons. They are not diffraction replicas, like the\nreplicas generated by the modulation of the Bi-O plane\ncommonly observed in Bi cuprates [15], as their\npolarization dependence is different from that of the\nmain lines (their periodicity is also completely different\nfrom that of the Bi modulation [11]). They indicate a true\nreconstruction of the electronic structure with the RS\nperiodicity. In BiBa, there is a particularly clear replica\ncentered at R1, which corresponds to the main FS\ntranslated by a*+b1*. In (Bi0.7Pb0.3)Sr, the situation\n\n2\n\n\fFig. 2 : (a) 3D stacking of the planes in Bi misfit cobaltates.\nClosed symbols correspond to b=0 and open symbols to b=1/4\n(Co and O) or b=1/2 (Ba and Bi). (b) In-plane projection of the\nstructure. Co atoms are shown as open blue circles, Ba above\nthe CoO2 plane as green filled circles and oxygens above\n(below) the CoO2 plane as small solid (open) red circles.\nOxygen triangles above a Co ion are shown as dashed red.\n\nbecomes more complicated because of the\nincommensurability that could, in principle, generate an\ninfinity of replicas. Nevertheless, three well defined\nreplicas are observed at the two equivalent R1 points and\nat R3. They can be obtained by translations of the main\nFS from \u03931 or \u03933, respectively, which generate replicas\nthat do not coincide anymore, because of the\nincommensurability.\nReplicas are expected to be observed in ARPES,\nevery time there is a new periodicity in a system [16],\nwhether it originates from neighboring layers or is\nintrinsic to one layer, as for example in a Charge Density\nWave (CDW). These two types of replica were for\nexample clearly observed in the CDW compound CeTe3\n[17]. In principle, their intensity is a measure of the\nstrength of the coupling at the origin of the new\nperiodicity [16] and it decreases fast for high order\nreplicas. The observation of replicas in misfit cobaltates\nis therefore not so surprising, but proves that the\ncoupling between the CoO2 and RS planes is large\nenough to affect the electronic structure. Unfortunately,\nit is not possible to be more quantitative, as the ARPES\nintensities are strongly modulated by matrix-element\neffects. One can observe in Fig. 1 that the intensities of\nthe different replicas are quite different (this is also true\nfor the main FS in different BZ) and we observed that\nthey also depend strongly on photon energy.\nSimilar replicas were recently reported by Ou et al.\nin BiBa [1], but they were attributed to an intrinsic\n\nFig. 3 : (a) In-plane structure for BiSr over 6 neighboring RS\ncells (blue rectangles). Green points represent Sr atoms above\nthe CoO2 slab and open green circles the nearest stable position\nabove an oxygen triangle (small red points). (b) STM image of\nBiSr at 300K. The stripes are aligned along a. This image was\nacquired with a voltage of 3.5V and a feedback current of 1.5nA.\nIt was also reproduced in different experimental conditions, for\nthree different samples.\n\nmetallic character of the RS planes. As stated in\nintroduction, this would force to reconsider considerably\nthe usual understanding of doping in layered systems.\nWe believe that the clear hexagonal shape of the replica\nin Fig. 1a, which was not clearly resolved in the work of\nOu et al., is an unambiguous proof that it belongs to the\nCoO2 electronic structure, and not to the RS. The\nimpression that the main peaks and replicas originate\nfrom two different sub-systems was enhanced in their\nwork by the fact that they observed either the main peaks\nor their replicas, but this is just due to a peculiar matrix\nelement effects [18] and we show here that they usually\ncoexist. We also show here that replica are a general\nfeature of misfit cobaltates that is not associated to the\nstrain of the RS, contrary to assumptions of Ou et al.\n(this strain is indeed much reduced in (Bi0.7Pb0.3)Sr,\nwhere a \u2248 b1). Therefore, we do not see any reason to\nassume metallicity of the RS planes to describe these\nobservations, which just attest that the carriers, likely\nconfined in the CoO2 slabs, do sense the RS periodicity.\nWe may now turn to the second part of our\ninvestigation, which aims at understanding the nature of\nthe coupling detected between the RS and CoO2 slabs.\nThe main reason for the carriers to feel the RS\nperiodicity is that the RS creates a potential that adds to\nthe one of the CoO2 slab. One could first expect this\npotential to be quite smooth, especially compared to that\nof a Na layer, as there is a regular alternation of A2+ and\n\n3\n\n\f(a) x<0.7\n\n(b) x>0.7\n\nFig. 4 : Sketch of the different FS behaviors expected as x\nincreases. The red solid hexagon is the CoO2 BZ, the blue\nrectangle the RS BZ and the dotted red hexagon, the FS before\nreconstruction. The FS after reconstruction is shown with black\nlines. (a) The FS is larger than the RS BZ. A gap opens when\nthe FS crosses its replicas (dotted blue hexagons), which lowers\nthe electronic energy and creates small FS pockets. The\nthickness of the lines is proportional to the ARPES spectral\nweight, which remains concentrated along the original hexagon\n[16]. (b) The FS is smaller than the RS BZ. No gap would open\nat the Fermi level in these conditions, unless the FS is enlarged\nby localization of a fraction of the charges (black hexagon).\nThis FS could also undergo reconstruction, which is not\nsketched.\n\nO2- ions. However, a closer look at the actual structure in\nFig. 2a shows that there is a strong displacement of 0.4\u00c5\nof the A ions towards the CoO2 planes. This is a common\nfeature of all misfit compounds [1,11,14]. This will\ncreate a net positive charge, as seen from the CoO2\nplane, which resembles the case of a Na+. Moreover, Fig.\n2b reveals that, in BiBa, the sites for Ba2+ are nearly the\nsame as that of Na+. Na locates preferentially at the\ncenter of an oxygen triangle, either just above a Co [this\nsite is called Na(1)] or in the middle of a Co triangle\n[called Na(2)] [3]. In BiBa, the Ba at the corners of the\ncell occupies a position similar to Na(1) and those at the\ncenter a position similar to Na(2). The only difference is\nthat, whereas Na is free to move exactly to the center of\nthe oxygen triangle, the Ba positions are primarily\nconstrained to a rectangular lattice. As the centers of the\ntriangles are not regularly spaced, Ba moves to an\naverage position, by shifting the whole plane by 0.4\u00c5 in\nthe a direction (this is the origin of the tilt of the whole\nstructure represented in Fig. 2a). For the Ba-O plane\nbelow the CoO2 slab, the positions of the Ba are just\ntranslated by b1/2. Note that this configuration is exactly\nthat of Na0.5CoO2, although the doping is different in\nBiBa. In Na0.5CoO2, it has often been argued that this\nparticular Na order could induce a charge segregation\nbetween rows of Co3+ and Co4+, explaining the metalinsulator transition specific to this compound [7] (it was\nlater showed that the charge segregation, if present, must\nhave a much smaller amplitude [19]). Our description of\nthe BiBa structure reveals that a similar influence of the\n\nRS potential on electronic orderings in the CoO2 slabs\ncould also be discussed in misfit structures . We will\nreturn to this point later.\nFor misfit phases, the evolution of the RS potential\nwith the incommensurability is particularly interesting.\nWhen b1 shrinks, the density of A2+ ions per Co\nincreases, quite similarly as when x increases in the Na\nlayer. This also moves the A2+ charges away from the\nstable positions above the oxygen triangles, until a\ncoincidence is recovered for some common multiple of\nb1 and b2. This is sketched in Fig. 3a for the case of BiSr\n(m=1.82 and xS=0.75), where six RS unit-cells define an\napproximately\ncommensurate\nunit-cell\n(6b1=10.9b2=31\u00c5). Of course, the position of the A2+\ncharges may distort to optimise their location above\noxygen triangles. Indeed, structural modulations are\ncommonly observed in misfits, both in A-O and Bi-O\nlayers [11,20]. However, Fig. 3a shows that a simple\nshift along b to the nearest stable position results in\nregions (indicated by large brackets), where Sr atoms\nwould be too close from each others. Therefore, a more\ncomplicated modulation, probably also involving shifts\nalong the z axis, should be found. These modulations\nwill inevitably create a strong modulation of the A2+\npotential sensed by Co along b, which raises in turn the\nquestion of its consequences on the distribution of\ncharge carriers in the plane.\nInterestingly, the STM image of BiSr in Fig. 3b\nreveals an extremely clear pattern of \"stripes\", ordered\nover very large areas (at least 1\u03bcm*1\u03bcm). The stripes are\naligned along a and exhibit a periodicity of 80\u00c5 along b,\nmuch larger than the approximately commensurate\nsuper-cell considered in Fig. 3a. The periodicity and\ndirection of the stripes do not match that of the Bi\nmodulation (q*=0.293a*+0.915c* in BiSr, i.e. 17\u00c5 along\na [11]). This pattern indicates that the system finds a way\nto reorganize over surprisingly large unit cells and that\nthe RS potential is certainly not random or disordered at\nthe local scale. If interpreted topologically, the difference\nin height between dark and bright regions is about 1\u00c5,\nwhich could well produce large differences of potentials\nattracting preferentially, and maybe pinning, charges in\none of these regions. We do not know at present whether\nthis ordering is present throughout the whole bulk or\nenhanced at the surface and whether there is an\nelectronic ordering associated to this pattern.\nNevertheless, this shows that the carriers of the CoO2\nslabs in misfit cobaltates will be submitted to a RS\npotential with an amplitude modulated along b with a\nperiodicity ranging from the unit cell (BiBa) up to very\nlarge unit-cells (BiSr), depending on m.\nTwo different effects of the RS potential could be\nconsidered. The first one is the reconstruction of the\nelectronic structure with the RS periodicity, evidenced\n\n4\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 5 : (a) FS in CaCo measured at the CASSIOPEE beamline,\nat 50K and 100eV photon energy. (b) Circles : kF along \u0393M as\na function of x in NaxCoO2 taken from ref. 9 (solid), ref. 20\n(open) and our work (crossed). For x>0.7, the FS splits and we\nreport the two kF values. Squares : kF(M) in different misfits as a\nfunction of xS, the equivalent x calculated from the TEP scale\n(see text).\n\nby the presence of replicas. If the FS and its replicas\nintersect, this also leads to the FS recontruction sketched\nin Fig. 4a. Gaps open at the crossings between the\noriginal FS and its replicas, leading to small FS pockets.\nSuch a mechanism was proposed to explain the de HaasVan Alphen oscillations observed in Na cobaltates,\nwhich correspond to very small FS areas [27]. As the\nARPES spectral weight remains concentrated along the\noriginal hexagon [16], such a reconstruction will be\nmore difficult to detect with ARPES, especially if the\ngaps are small or the order is not perfect. Such a picture\nthen allows to reconcile the large hexagonal FS observed\nwith ARPES and the small FS pockets observed with de\nHaas-Van Alphen measurements.\nAnother possible consequence of the RS potential\ncould be to localize holes or electrons at minima or\nmaxima of this potential, as seems to occur in NaxCoO2\n[5,28,29]. This will change the effective number of\ncarriers in the metallic band, therefore the size of the\nunreconstructed FS, as sketched in Fig. 4b.The effective\nnumber of metallic carriers in the different phases can be\ndeduced from the area of the unreconstructed FS using\nthe Luttinger theorem [21]. Assuming a hexagonal FS,\nthis area just depends on one kF value, for example kF(M)\nalong \u0393M, and the number of metallic holes is\nnh=2(kF(M)/\u0393K)2 (the factor 2 accounts for spin\ndegeneracy). This corresponds to an effective doping\nxm=1-nh. In BiBa, kF(M) =0.57(5)\u00c5-1 was determined from\nmeasurements in 4 different samples, including Fig. 1a\nand the more accurate measurement of ref. [4]. It yields\nxm=0.7, in perfect agreement with the TEP scale xs. In\n(Bi0.7Pb0.3)Sr, kF(M) is less clearly defined because of the\noverlap of the replicas. The hexagon of Fig. 1b is drawn\nwith kF(M)= 0.65\u00c5-1. In BiSr, the QP is unfortunately too\nsmall to extract reliably a kF value, although FL\ncrossings also clearly exist there. An additional\nmeasurement is presented in Fig. 5a for CaCo, a misfit\nwith only 3 RS layers (Ca-O/Co-O/Ca-O), m=1.62 and\nxS=0.75 [22]. We confirmed it in 3 different samples,\n\nyielding kF(M)=0.78(7)\u00c5. The fact that the FS is larger in\nCaCo than in BiBa is then clearly above experimental\nincertitude. However, this means that xm=0.45 in CaCo\nin strong disagreement with the TEP scale and all other\nproperties of CaCo, which resemble that of cobaltates\nwith x>0.7 : the susceptibility becomes Curie-Weiss, it\nacquires negative magnetoresistance and orders\nmagnetically below T=30K [22,23]. It is also less\nmetallic than BiBa [19], like other misfit cobaltates with\nx>0.7 [12].\nThis apparent contradiction may in fact reveal very\nimportant physics of the CoO2 slabs. We plot in Fig. 5b\nthe values of kF(M) obtained in misfits, together with\nthose obtained by previous studies of NaxCoO2 [9,24], as\nwell as our own observation in Na0.82CoO2. The solid\nline describes the evolution of xm with kF(M) expected\nfrom the Luttinger theorem. We observe that, although\nthe Luttinger theorem is well obeyed for x<0.7 [24],\nthere is a strong deviation for x>0.7 in both families.\nThe deviation then appears robust in the CoO2 plane and\ncannot be easily attributed to a surface problem [25], the\nmagnetic state or the dimensionality [9], which are all\nquite different in misfit and Na cobaltates.\nAn interesting point is that this deviation appears\nabove x=0.6-0.7, precisely in the region where Na\ncobaltates cease to be conventional metals, but exhibit\nmagnetic correlations [7] and static Co3+ [5,6]. As a first\napproximation, these Co3+ can be treated as disordered,\njust taking electrons out of the metallic band, resulting in\nmore holes in the metallic band than expected from\nstoichiometry and larger FS. An effective band filling\nxm=0.45 in CaCo would for example be consistent with\nxS=0.75, if 55% of the Co sites are localized Co3+. A\ntendency to electron localization then explains quite well\nthe deviation and even seems to us an important\nconfirmation of this phenomena in NaxCoO2 at x>0.6\n(this was also suggested in ref. [26]), but also in misfit\ncobaltates, which it is rather unexpected. Electron\nlocalization then appears as an intrinsic tendency of the\nCoO2 plane in this doping range. Note that the deviation\nrules out hole localization, i.e. localized Co4+ magnetic\nmoments, which was proposed to explain the CurieWeiss susceptibilities [27], but would, on the contrary,\ndecrease the FS area [30]. The information on the RS\npotential gathered in this paper led us to conclude that\nthe RS potential plays the role of Na potential in misfit\ncobaltates. We note that if the Co3+ adopt an ordered\nstructure, as seems to be the case for Na cobaltates, at\nleast in the bulk [5], a new \"metallic\" BZ should be\ndefined and the application of the Luttinger theorem\nbecomes more complicated. However, the qualitative\ntendency to increase the FS area remains.\nThis study then implies an extreme sensitivity of\nthe electronic structure of the CoO2 slab to the potential\n\n5\n\n\fof neighboring layers (NL) at high x. As calculated for\nNaxCoO2 [28], this is reasonable as these potentials\neasily exceed the very small QP energy scale probed in\nARPES measurements [4,9,24]. The fact that it occurs\nonly in a limited doping range and quite reproducibly in\ntwo families that are very different from the structural\npoint of view further implies some intrinsic connection\nbetween the electronic structure and this charge\nlocalization. Indeed, we can expect two different regimes\nas a function of doping for the coupling to the NL\npotential, as sketched in Fig. 4. At low x, the FS is large\nand will, in most cases, intersect the NL BZ (we consider\nhere the elementary NL BZ, such as the blue rectangle\n(a*,b1*) of Fig. 1 for misfits, which is the basic\nadditional periodicity modulating the electronic\nstructure). We then expect a reconstruction that\neffectively lowers the electronic energy (Fig. 4a).. At\nhigher x, the FS shrinks and should not intersect the NL\nBZ anymore. Fig. 1 shows that this regime is just\nachieved for BiBa, suggesting a transition for x \u2248 0.7. In\nthis regime, no electronic energy would be gained\nanymore by gap openings, unless charge localization\nenlarges back the FS to produce intersections. Indeed,\nx \u2248 0.7 corresponds well to the doping at which the\ndeviation from Luttinger theorem starts. The system may\ngain energy by reconstructing the enlarged FS but also\nby choosing a structure for the localized charges that\noptimises the Coulombic interactions with the NL. We\npropose that this is the reason for stabilizing such orders,\nwhose originality resides in the fact that the periodicity\ncannot be adapted to the electronic structure (e.g. kF in a\nCDW) but is fixed by an external potential. Different\norders are probably realized in the two cobaltate\nfamilies. Localized Co3+ are known to form in NaxCoO2\nunder Na(1) sites, leaving a 2D metallic lattice, different\nfrom the triangular one. In misfits, we rather anticipate a\ntype of 1D ordering in broad \"stripes\" with modulated\ncharges, as suggested by the STM pattern in BiSr. Note\nthat the modulation does not necessarily create Co3+,\nwhich were not directly detected by NMR in this\ncompound [13]. These different orders in turn affect the\nelectronic properties : NaxCoO2 remain good metals up\nto high x [10], while misfit cobaltates become almost\ninsulating [4]. This could mean that the 2D charge order\nin NaxCoO2 let the itinerant carriers flow, while the 1D\norder of misfit cobaltates act as barriers. In any case, the\nfine structure of the FS becomes much more complicated\nthan expected and this is probably an important fact to\ntake into account to describe the intriguing evolution of\nthe electronic properties in this limit.\n\nLEEM experiments on BiSr. AN acknowledges support\nfrom the EC contract No. MEST CT 2004 514307\nEMERGENT CONDMAT-PHYS Orsay.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.W.
