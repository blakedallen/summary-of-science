Out of this endeavor two main directions have emerged as the\nmost promising to attack the problem, namely, the superstring theories and non-commutative\ngeometry. The two approaches, although at a different stage of development, have common\nunification targets and share similar hopes for exhibiting improved renormalization properties\nin the ultraviolet(UV) as compared to ordinary field theories. Moreover the two frameworks\ncame closer by the observation that a natural realization of non-commutativity of space\nappears in the string theory context of D-branes in the presence of a constant background\nantisymmetric field [1]. However, despite the importance of having frameworks to discuss\nquantum gravity in a self-consistent way and possibly to construct there finite theories, it\nis very interesting to search for the minimal realistic framework in which finiteness can take\nplace. In addition the main goal expected from a unified description of interactions by the\nparticle physics community is to understand the present day large number of free parameters\nof the Standard Model (SM) in terms of a few fundamental ones. In other words, to achieve\nreduction of couplings at a more fundamental level. A complementary, and certainly not\ncontradicting, program has been developed [2\u20134] in searching for a more fundamental theory\npossibly at the Planck scale called Finite Unified Theories (FUTs), whose basic ingredients\nare field theoretical Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and supersymmetry (SUSY), but its\nconsequences certainly go beyond the known ones.\nFinite Unified Theories are N = 1 supersymmetric GUTs which can be made finite even to\nall-loop orders, including the soft supersymmetry breaking sector. The method to construct\nGUTs with reduced independent parameters [5, 6] consists of searching for renormalization\ngroup invariant (RGI) relations holding below the Planck scale, which in turn are preserved\ndown to the GUT scale. Of particular interest is the possibility to find RGI relations among\ncouplings that guarantee finiteness to all-orders in perturbation theory [7, 8]. In order to\nachieve the latter it is enough to study the uniqueness of the solutions to the one-loop\nfiniteness conditions [7\u20139]. The constructed finite unified N = 1 supersymmetric GUTs,\nusing the above tools, predicted correctly from the dimensionless sector (Gauge-Yukawa\nunification), among others, the top quark mass [2]. The search for RGI relations and finiteness\nhas been extended to the soft supersymmetry breaking sector (SSB) of these theories [10\u201319],\nwhich involves parameters of dimension one and two. Eventually, the full theories can be\nmade all-loop finite and their predictive power is extended to the Higgs sector and the SUSY\nspectrum. This, in turn, allows to make predictions for low-energy precision and astrophysical\nobservables. The purpose of the present article is to do an exhaustive search of these latter\npredictions of the SU(5) finite models, taking into account the restrictions resulting from\nthe low-energy observables. Then we present the predictions of the models under study for\nthe parameter space that is still allowed after taking the phenomenological restrictions into\naccount. Here we focus on the Higgs boson sector and the SUSY spectrum.\nIn our search we consider the restrictions imposed on the parameter space of the models\ndue to the following observables: the 3rd generation quark masses, rare b decays, BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3)\nand BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), as well as the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, Mh . Present\ndata on these observables already provide interesting information about the allowed SUSY\nmass scales. The non-discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP [20, 21] excludes a part of the\n\n1\n\n\fotherwise allowed parameter space. However the non-discovery of supersymmetric particles at\nLEP does not impose any restrictions on the parameter space of the models, given that their\nSUSY spectra turn out to be very heavy anyway. An important further constraint is provided\nby the density of dark matter in the Universe, which is tightly constrained by WMAP and\nother astrophysical and cosmological data [22], assuming that the dark matter consists largely\nof neutralinos [23]. We also briefly discuss the implication from the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon, (g \u2212 2)\u03bc . Other recent analyses of GUT based models confronted with\nlow-energy observables and dark matter constraints can be found in Refs. [24, 25].\nIn this context we first review the sensitivity of each observable to indirect effects of\nsupersymmetry, taking into account the present experimental and theoretical uncertainties.\nLater on we investigate the part of parameter space in the FUT models under consideration\nthat is still allowed taking into account all low-energy observables.\nIn Sect. 2 of the paper we review the conditions of finiteness in N = 1 SUSY gauge\ntheories. The consequences of finiteness for the soft SUSY-breaking terms are discussed in\nSect. 3. The two SU(5) FUT models that emerge are briefly presented in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5\nwe discuss different precision observables, including the cold dark matter constraint. Sect. 6\ncontains the analysis of the parts of parameter space that survive all constraints and the final\npredictions of the models. We conclude with Sect. 7.\n\n2\n\nReduction of Couplings and Finiteness in N = 1 SUSY\nGauge Theories\n\nHere we review the main points and ideas concerning the reduction of couplings and finiteness\nin N = 1 supersymmetric theories. A RGI relation among couplings\ngi , \u03a6(g1 , * * * , gN )=0,\nPN\nhas to satisfy the partial differential equation \u03bc d\u03a6/d\u03bc =\ni=1 \u03b2i \u2202\u03a6/\u2202gi = 0, where \u03b2i\nis the \u03b2-function of gi . There exist (N \u2212 1) independent \u03a6's, and finding the complete\nset of these solutions is equivalent to solve the so-called reduction equations (REs) [5],\n\u03b2g (dgi /dg) = \u03b2i , i = 1, . . . , N, where g and \u03b2g are the primary coupling (in favor of which\nall other couplings are reduced) and its \u03b2-function. Using all the (N \u2212 1) \u03a6's to impose RGI\nrelations, one can in principle express all the couplings in terms of a single coupling g. The\ncomplete reduction, which formally preserves perturbative renormalizability, can be achieved\nby demanding a power series solution, whose uniqueness can be investigated at the one-loop\nlevel.\nFiniteness can be understood by considering a chiral, anomaly free, N = 1 globally\nsupersymmetric gauge theory based on a group G with gauge coupling constant g. The\nsuperpotential of the theory is given by\nW =\n\n1 ij\n1\nm \u03a6i \u03a6j + C ijk \u03a6i \u03a6j \u03a6k ,\n2\n6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mij (the mass terms) and C ijk (the Yukawa couplings) are gauge invariant tensors and\nthe matter field \u03a6i transforms according to the irreducible representation Ri of the gauge\ngroup G.\n\n2\n\n\fThe one-loop \u03b2-function of the gauge coupling g is given by\n\u03b2g(1) =\n\ng3 X\ndg\n=\n[\nl(Ri ) \u2212 3 C2(G) ] ,\ndt\n16\u03c0 2 i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere l(Ri ) is the Dynkin index of Ri and C2 (G) is the quadratic Casimir of the adjoint representation of the gauge group G. The \u03b2-functions of C ijk , by virtue of the non-renormalization\ntheorem, are related to the anomalous dimension matrix \u03b3ij of the matter fields \u03a6i as\n\u03b2Cijk =\n\nX\nd ijk\n1\nC = C ijp\n\u03b3pk(n) + (k \u2194 i) + (k \u2194 j) .\n2\nn\ndt\n(16\u03c0 )\nn=1\n\n(3)\n\nAt one-loop level \u03b3ij is given by\nj(1)\n\n\u03b3i\n\n1\n= Cipq C jpq \u2212 2 g 2 C2 (Ri )\u03b4ij ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\u2217\nwhere C2 (Ri ) is the quadratic Casimir of the representation Ri , and C ijk = Cijk\n.\nAll the one-loop \u03b2-functions of the theory vanish if the \u03b2-function of the gauge coupling\n(1)\nj(1)\n\u03b2g , and the anomalous dimensions \u03b3i , vanish, i.e.\n\nX\ni\n\nl(Ri ) = 3C2 (G) ,\n\n1\nCipq C jpq = 2\u03b4ij g 2 C2 (Ri ).\n2\n\n(5)\n\nA very interesting result is that the conditions (5) are necessary and sufficient for finiteness\nat the two-loop level [9, 13].\nThe one- and two-loop finiteness conditions (5) restrict considerably the possible choices\nof the irreducible representations Ri for a given group G as well as the Yukawa couplings in\nthe superpotential (1). Note in particular that the finiteness conditions cannot be applied\nto the supersymmetric standard model (SSM). The presence of a U(1) gauge group, whose\nC2 [U(1)] = 0, makes impossible to satisfy the condition (5). This leads to the expectation\nthat finiteness should be attained at the grand unified level only, the SSM being just the\ncorresponding low-energy, effective theory.\nThe finiteness conditions impose relations between gauge and Yukawa couplings. Therefore, we have to guarantee that such relations leading to a reduction of the couplings hold\nat any renormalization point. The necessary, but also sufficient, condition for this to happen\nis to require that such relations are solutions to the reduction equations (REs) to all orders.\nThe all-loop order finiteness theorem of [7] is based on: (a) the structure of the supercurrent\nin N = 1 SYM and on (b) the non-renormalization properties of N = 1 chiral anomalies.\nAlternatively, similar results can be obtained [8, 26] using an analysis of the all-loop NSVZ\ngauge beta-function [27].\n\n3\n\nSoft supersymmetry breaking and finiteness\n\nThe above described method of reducing the dimensionless couplings has been extended [10]\nto the soft supersymmetry breaking (SSB) dimensionful parameters of N = 1 supersymmetric\n\n3\n\n\ftheories. In addition it was found [11] that RGI SSB scalar masses in general Gauge-Yukawa\nunified models satisfy a universal sum rule at one-loop, which was subsequently extended\nfirst up to two-loops [3] and then to all-loops [12].\nTo be more specific, consider the superpotential given by (1) along with the Lagrangian\nfor SSB terms\n\u2212 LSB =\n\n1 ijk\n1\n1\n1\nh \u03c6i \u03c6j \u03c6k + bij \u03c6i \u03c6j + (m2 )ji \u03c6\u2217 i \u03c6j + M \u03bb\u03bb + h.c. ,\n6\n2\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the \u03c6i are the scalar parts of the chiral superfields \u03a6i , \u03bb are the gauginos and M their\nunified mass. Since we would like to consider only finite theories here, we assume that the\none-loop \u03b2-function of the gauge coupling g vanishes. We P\nalso assume that the reduction\nijk\n2n\nequations admit power series solutions of the form C = g n=0 \u03c1ijk\n. According to the\n(n) g\nfiniteness theorem of ref. [7], the theory is then finite to all orders in perturbation theory,\nj(1)\nif, among others, the one-loop anomalous dimensions \u03b3i vanish. The one- and two-loop\nfiniteness for hijk can be achieved [9, 13] by imposing the condition\n5\nhijk = \u2212MC ijk + * * * = \u2212M\u03c1ijk\n(0) g + O(g ) .\n\n(7)\n\nIn addition, it was found [3] that one and two-loop finiteness requires that the following\ntwo-loop sum rule for the soft scalar masses has to be satisfied\n( m2i + m2j + m2k )\ng2\n=\n1\n+\n\u2206(2) + O(g 4) ,\nMM \u2020\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206(2) is the two-loop correction,\n(2)\n\n\u2206\n\nX \u0014\u0012 m2 \u0013 \u0012 1 \u0013\u0015\ni\nl(Ri ) ,\n\u2212\n= \u22122\n\u2020\nMM\n3\ni\n\n(9)\n\nwhich vanishes for the universal choice [13], as well as in the models we consider in the next\nsection. Furthermore, it was found [14] that the relation\nhijk = \u2212Mg(C ijk )\u2032 \u2261 \u2212Mg\n\ndC ijk (g)\n,\nd ln g\n\n(10)\n\namong couplings is all-loop RGI. Moreover, the progress made using the spurion technique\nleads to all-loop relations among SSB \u03b2-functions [4, 14] and [16\u201319], which allowed to find\nthe all-loop RGI sum rule [12] in the Novikov-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov scheme [27].\n\n4\n\nFinite Unified Theories\n\nFinite Unified Theories (FUTs) have always attracted interest for their intriguing mathematical properties and their predictive power. One very important result is that the one-loop\nfiniteness conditions (5) are sufficient to guarantee two-loop finiteness [28]. A classification\nof possible one-loop finite models was done independently by several authors [29]. The first\none and two-loop finite SU(5) model was presented in [30], and shortly afterwards the conditions for finiteness in the soft SUSY-breaking sector at one-loop [9] were given. In [31] a one\n\n4\n\n\fand two-loop finite SU(5) model was presented where the rotation of the Higgs sector was\nproposed as a way of making it realistic. The first all-loop finite theory was studied in [2],\nwithout taking into account the soft breaking terms. Finite soft breaking terms and the proof\nthat one-loop finiteness in the soft terms also implies two-loop finiteness was done in [13].\nThe inclusion of soft breaking terms in a realistic model was done in [33] and their finiteness\nto all-loops studied in [34], although the universality of the soft breaking terms lead to a\ncharged LSP. This fact was also noticed in [35], where the inclusion of an extra parameter\nin the Higgs sector was introduced to alleviate it. The derivation of the sum-rule in the soft\nsupersymmetry breaking sector and the proof that it can be made all-loop finite were done\nin [12, 30, 31, 36], allowing thus for the construction of all-loop finite realistic models.\nFrom the classification of theories with vanishing one-loop gauge \u03b2 function [29], one can\neasily see that there exist only two candidate possibilities to construct SU(5) GUTs with three\ngenerations. These possibilities require that the theory should contain as matter fields the\nchiral supermultiplets 5, 5, 10, 5, 24 with the multiplicities (6, 9, 4, 1, 0) and (4, 7, 3, 0, 1),\nrespectively. Only the second one contains a 24-plet which can be used to provide the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking (SB) of SU(5) down to SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). For the first\nmodel one has to incorporate another way, such as the Wilson flux breaking mechanism to\nachieve the desired SB of SU(5) [2]. Therefore, for a self-consistent field theory discussion\nwe would like to concentrate only on the second possibility.\nThe particle content of the models we will study consists of the following supermultiplets:\nthree (5 + 10), needed for each of the three generations of quarks and leptons, four (5 + 5)\nand one 24 considered as Higgs supermultiplets. When the gauge group of the finite GUT is\nbroken the theory is no longer finite, and we will assume that we are left with the MSSM.\nTherefore, a predictive Gauge-Yukawa unified SU(5) model which is finite to all orders,\nin addition to the requirements mentioned already, should also have the following properties:\n(1) j\n\n1. One-loop anomalous dimensions are diagonal, i.e., \u03b3i\n\n\u221d \u03b4ij .\n\n2. The three fermion generations, in the irreducible representations 5i , 10i (i = 1, 2, 3),\nshould not couple to the adjoint 24.\n3. The two Higgs doublets of the MSSM should mostly be made out of a pair of Higgs\nquintet and anti-quintet, which couple to the third generation.\nIn the following we discuss two versions of the all-order finite model. The model of Ref. [2],\nwhich will be labeled A, and a slight variation of this model (labeled B), which can also be\nobtained from the class of the models suggested in Ref. [37] with a modification to suppress\nnon-diagonal anomalous dimensions [3].\nThe superpotential which describes the two models before the reduction of couplings takes\nplaces is of the form [2, 30, 31, 36]\n3\nX\n1\nu\nW =\n[ giu 10i 10i Hi + gid 10i 5i H i ] + g23\n102 103 H4\n2\ni=1\nd\n+g23\n\n102 53 H 4 +\n\nd\ng32\n\n103 52 H 4 +\n\n4\nX\na=1\n\n5\n\ngaf Ha 24 H a +\n\n(11)\ng\u03bb\n(24)3 ,\n3\n\n\f51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\nH1\n\nH2\n\nH3\n\nH4\n\nH1\n\nH2\n\nH3\n\nH4\n\n24\n\nZ7\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n-5\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nZ3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nZ2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTable 1: Charges of the Z7 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z2 symmetry for Model FUTA.\nwhere Ha and H a (a = 1, . . . , 4) stand for the Higgs quintets and anti-quintets.\nWe will investigate two realizations of the model, labelled A and B. The main difference\nbetween model A and model B is that two pairs of Higgs quintets and anti-quintets couple\nto the 24 in B, so that it is not necessary to mix them with H4 and H 4 in order to achieve\nthe triplet-doublet splitting after the symmetry breaking of SU(5) [3]. Thus, although the\nparticle content is the same, the solutions to Eq.(5) and the sum rules are different, which\nwill reflect in the phenomenology, as we will see.\n\n4.1\n\nFUTA\n\nAfter the reduction of couplings the symmetry of the superpotential W (11) is enhanced. For\nmodel A one finds that the superpotential has the Z7 \u00d7 Z3 \u00d7 Z2 discrete symmetry with the\ncharge assignment as shown in Table 1, and with the following superpotential\nW =\n\n3\nX\ng\u03bb\n1\n[ giu 10i 10i Hi + gid 10i 5i H i ] + g4f H4 24 H 4 +\n(24)3 ,\n2\n3\ni=1\n\n(12)\n\n(1)\n\nThe non-degenerate and isolated solutions to \u03b3i = 0 for model FUTA, which are the\nboundary conditions for the Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale, are:\n6\n8\n8 2\ng , (g1d )2 = g 2 , (g2u )2 = (g3u )2 = g 2 ,\n5\n5\n5\n6\nu 2\nd 2\nd 2\n) = 0 , (g23\n) = (g32\n) =0,\n(g2d )2 = (g3d )2 = g 2 , (g23\n5\n15\n(g \u03bb)2 = g 2 , (g2f )2 = (g3f )2 = 0 , (g1f )2 = 0 , (g4f )2 = g 2 .\n7\n\n(g1u )2 =\n\n(13)\n\nIn the dimensionful sector, the sum rule gives us the following boundary conditions at the\nGUT scale for this model [30, 31, 36]:\nm2Hu + 2m210 = m2Hd + m52 + m210 = M 2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nand thus we are left with only three free parameters, namely m5 \u2261 m53 , m10 \u2261 m103 and M.\n\n4.2\n\nFUTB\n\nAlso in the case of FUTB the symmetry is enhanced after the reduction of couplings.

This can be achieved by introducing appropriate mass\nterms that allow to perform a rotation of the Higgs sector [2, 30\u201332], in such a way that only\none pair of Higgs doublets, coupled mostly to the third family, remains light and acquire\nvacuum expectation values. To avoid fast proton decay the usual fine tuning to achieve\ndoublet-triplet splitting is performed. Notice that, although similar, the mechanism is not\nidentical to minimal SU(5), since we have an extended Higgs sector.\nThus, after the gauge symmetry of the GUT theory is broken we are left with the MSSM,\nwith the boundary conditions for the third family given by the finiteness conditions, while\nthe other two families are basically decoupled.\nWe will now examine the phenomenology of such all-loop Finite Unified theories with\nSU(5) gauge group and, for the reasons expressed above, we will concentrate only on the\nthird generation of quarks and leptons. An extension to three families, and the generation of\n\n7\n\n\fquark mixing angles and masses in Finite Unified Theories has been addressed in [38], where\nseveral examples are given. These extensions are not considered here. Realistic Finite Unified\nTheories based on product gauge groups, where the finiteness implies three generations of\nmatter, have also been studied [39].\n\n5\n\nRestrictions from the low-energy observables\n\nSince the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken below MGUT , the finiteness conditions do\nnot restrict the renormalization properties at low energies, and all it remains are boundary\nconditions on the gauge and Yukawa couplings (13) or (16), the h = \u2212MC relation (7), and\nthe soft scalar-mass sum rule (8) at MGUT , as applied in the two models. Thus we examine\nthe evolution of these parameters according to their RGEs up to two-loops for dimensionless\nparameters and at one-loop for dimensionful ones with the relevant boundary conditions.\nBelow MGUT their evolution is assumed to be governed by the MSSM. We further assume\na unique supersymmetry breaking scale MSUSY (which we define as the geometrical average\nof the stop masses) and therefore below that scale the effective theory is just the SM. This\nallows to evaluate observables at or below the electroweak scale.\nIn the following, we briefly describe the low-energy observables used in our analysis. We\ndiscuss the current precision of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions. We\nalso give relevant details of the higher-order perturbative corrections that we include. We do\nnot discuss theoretical uncertainties from the RG running between the high-scale parameters\nand the weak scale. At present, these uncertainties are expected to be less important than\nthe experimental and theoretical uncertainties of the precision observables.\nAs precision observables we first discuss the 3rd generation quark masses that are leading\nto the strongest constraints on the models under investigation. Next we apply B physics and\nHiggs-boson mass constraints. Parameter points surviving these constraints are then tested\nwith the cold dark matter (CDM) abundance in the early universe. We also briefly discuss\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\n\n5.1\n\nThe quark masses\n\nSince the masses of the (third generation) quarks are no free parameters in our model but\npredicted in terms of the GUT scale parameters and the \u03c4 mass, mt and mb are (as it turns\nout the most restrictive) precision observables for our analysis. For the top-quark mass we\nuse the current experimental value for the pole mass [40]\nmexp\n= 170.9 \u00b1 1.8 GeV .\nt\n\n(18)\n\nFor the bottom-quark mass we use the value at the bottom-quark mass scale or at MZ [41]\nmb (mb ) = 4.25 \u00b1 0.1 GeV or mb (MZ ) = 2.82 \u00b1 0.07 GeV .\n\n(19)\n\nIt should be noted that a numerically important correction appears in the relation between\nthe bottom-quark mass and the bottom Yukawa coupling (that also enters the corresponding\nRGE running). The leading tan \u03b2-enhanced corrections arise from one-loop contributions\n\n8\n\n\fwith gluino-sbottom and chargino-stop loops. We include the leading effects via the quantity\n\u2206b [42] (see also Refs. [43\u201345]). Numerically the correction to the relation between the\nbottom-quark mass and the bottom Yukawa coupling is usually by far the dominant part of\nthe contributions from the sbottom sector (see also Refs. [46, 47]). In the limit of large soft\nSUSY-breaking parameters and tan \u03b2 \u226b 1, \u2206b is given by [42]\n\u2206b =\n\n\u03b1t\n2\u03b1s\nmg\u0303 \u03bc tan \u03b2 \u00d7 I(mb\u03031 , mb\u03032 , mg\u0303 ) +\nAt \u03bc tan \u03b2 \u00d7 I(mt\u03031 , mt\u03032 , |\u03bc|) ,\n3\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the gluino mass is denoted by mg\u0303 and \u03b1f \u2261 h2f /(4 \u03c0), hf being a fermion Yukawa\ncoupling. The function I is defined as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\na2\nb2\nc2\n2 2\n2 2\n2 2\nI(a, b, c) =\na b log 2 + b c log 2 + c a log 2\n(21)\n(a2 \u2212 b2 )(b2 \u2212 c2 )(a2 \u2212 c2 )\nb\nc\na\n1\n.\n\u223c\n2\nmax(a , b2 , c2 )\nA corresponding correction of O(\u03b1\u03c4 ) has been included for the relation between the \u03c4 lepton\nmass and the \u03c4 Yukawa coupling. However, this correction is much smaller than the one\ngiven in eq. (20).\nThe \u2206b corrections are included by the replacement\nmb \u2192\n\nmb\n,\n1 + \u2206b\n\n(22)\n\nresulting in a resummation of the leading terms in O(\u03b1s tan \u03b2) and O(\u03b1t tan \u03b2) to all-orders.\nExpanding eq. (22) to first or second order gives an estimate of the effect of the resummation\nof the \u2206b terms and has been used as an estimate of unknown higher-order corrections (see\nbelow).\n\n5.2\n\nThe decay b \u2192 s\u03b3\n\nSince this decay occurs at the loop level in the SM, the MSSM contribution might a priori be\nof similar magnitude. A recent theoretical estimate of the SM contribution to the branching\nratio at the NNLO QCD level is [48]\nBR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) = (3.15 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(23)\n\nIt should be noted that the error estimate for BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) is still under discussion [49], and\nthat other SM contributions to b \u2192 s\u03b3 have been calculated [50]. These corrections are small\ncompared with the theoretical uncertainty quoted in eq. (23).\nFor comparison, the present experimental value estimated by the Heavy Flavour Averaging Group (HFAG) is [51, 52]\n\u22124\nBR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) = (3.55 \u00b1 0.24+0.09\n\u22120.10 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the first error is the combined statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainty, the\nlatter two errors are correlated systematic theoretical uncertainties and corrections respectively.\n\n9\n\n\fOur numerical results have been derived with the BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) evaluation provided in\nRefs. [53\u201355], incorporating also the latest SM corrections provided in Ref. [48]. The calculation has been checked against other codes [56\u201358]. Concerning the total error in a conservative\napproach we add linearly the errors of eqs. (23) and (24) as well an intrinsic SUSY error of\n0.15 \u00d7 10\u22124 [25].\n\n5.3\n\nThe decay Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\nThe SM prediction for this branching ratio is (3.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22129 [59], and the present experimental upper limit from the Fermilab Tevatron collider is 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 at the 95% C.L. [60],\nstill providing the possibility for the MSSM to dominate the SM contribution. The current\nTevatron sensitivity, being based on an integrated luminosity of about 2 fb\u22121 , is expected to\nimprove somewhat in the future. In Ref. [60] an estimate of the future Tevatron sensitivity\nof 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 at the 90% C.L. has been given, and a sensitivity even down to the SM value\ncan be expected at the LHC. Assuming the SM value, i.e. BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) \u2248 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 , it\nhas been estimated [61] that LHCb can observe 33 signal events over 10 background events\nwithin 3 years of low-luminosity running. Therefore this process offers good prospects for\nprobing the MSSM.\nFor the theoretical prediction we use the code implemented in Ref. [56] (see also Ref. [62]),\nwhich includes the full one-loop evaluation and the leading two-loop QCD corrections. We are\nnot aware of a detailed estimate of the theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher-order\ncorrections.\n\n5.4\n\nThe lightest MSSM Higgs boson mass\n\nThe mass of the lightest CP-even MSSM Higgs boson can be predicted in terms of the other\nSUSY parameters. At the tree level, the two CP-even Higgs boson masses are obtained as\na function of MZ , the CP-odd Higgs boson mass MA , and tan \u03b2. We employ the Feynmandiagrammatic method for the theoretical prediction of Mh , using the code FeynHiggs [63\u201366],\nwhich includes all relevant higher-order corrections. The status of the incorporated results\ncan be summarized as follows. For the one-loop part, the complete result within the MSSM\nis known [67, 68]. Concerning the two-loop effects, their computation is quite advanced, see\nRef. [65] and references therein. They include the strong corrections at O(\u03b1t \u03b1s ) and Yukawa\ncorrections at O(\u03b1t2 ) to the dominant one-loop O(\u03b1t ) term, and the strong corrections from\nthe bottom/sbottom sector at O(\u03b1b \u03b1s ). For the b/b\u0303 sector corrections also an all-order\nresummation of the tan \u03b2 -enhanced terms, O(\u03b1b (\u03b1s tan \u03b2)n ), is known. The current intrinsic\nerror of Mh due to unknown higher-order corrections have been estimated to be [65, 69\u201371]\n\u2206Mhintr,current = 3 GeV.\n\n(25)\n\nThe lightest MSSM Higgs boson is the models under consideration is always SM-like\n(see also Refs. [72, 73]). Consequently, the current LEP bound of Mhexp > 114.4 GeV at the\n95% C.L. can be taken over [20, 21].\n\n10\n\n\f5.5\n\nCold dark matter density\n\nFinally we discuss the impact of the cold dark matter (CDM) density. It is well known\nthat the lightest neutralino, being the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), is an excellent\ncandidate for CDM [23]. Consequently we demand that the lightest neutralino is indeed the\nLSP. Parameters leading to a different LSP are discarded.\nThe current bound, favored by a joint analysis of WMAP and other astrophysical and\ncosmological data [22], is at the 2 \u03c3 level given by the range\n0.094 < \u03a9CDM h2 < 0.129 .\n\n(26)\n\nAssuming that the cold dark matter is composed predominantly of LSPs, the determination\nof \u03a9CDM h2 imposes very strong constraints on the MSSM parameter space. As will become\nclear below, no model points fulfill the strict bound of eq. (26). On the other hand, many\nmodel parameters would yield a very large value of \u03a9CDM . It should be kept in mind that\nsomewhat larger values might be allowed due to possible uncertainties in the determination\nof the SUSY spectrum (as they might arise at large tan \u03b2, see below).\nHowever, on a more general basis and not speculating about unknown higher-order uncertainties, a mechanism is needed in our model to reduce the CDM abundance in the early\nuniverse. This issue could, for instance, be related to another problem, that of neutrino\nmasses. This type of masses cannot be generated naturally within the class of finite unified\ntheories that we are considering in this paper, although a non-zero value for neutrino masses\nhas clearly been established [41]. However, the class of FUTs discussed here can, in principle,\nbe easily extended by introducing bilinear R-parity violating terms that preserve finiteness\nand introduce the desired neutrino masses [102]. R-parity violation [103] would have a small\nimpact on the collider phenomenology presented here (apart from fact the SUSY search\nstrategies could not rely on a 'missing energy' signature), but remove the CDM bound of\neq. (26) completely. The details of such a possibility in the present framework attempting to\nprovide the models with realistic neutrino masses will be discussed elsewhere. Other mechanisms, not involving R-parity violation (and keeping the 'missing energy' signature), that\ncould be invoked if the amount of CDM appears to be too large, concern the cosmology of\nthe early universe. For instance, \"thermal inflation\" [74] or \"late time entropy injection\" [75]\ncould bring the CDM density into agreement with the WMAP measurements. This kind\nof modifications of the physics scenario neither concerns the theory basis nor the collider\nphenomenology, but could have a strong impact on the CDM derived bounds.\nTherefore, in order to get an impression of the possible impact of the CDM abundance on\nthe collider phenomenology in our models under investigation, we will analyze the case that\nthe LSP does contribute to the CDM density, and apply a more loose bound of\n\u03a9CDM h2 < 0.3 .\n\n(27)\n\n(Lower values than the ones permitted by eq. (26) are naturally allowed if another particle\nthan the lightest neutralino constitutes CDM.) For our evaluation we have used the code\nMicroMegas [56].\n\n11\n\n\f5.6\n\nThe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\n\nWe finally comment on the status and the impact of the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon, a\u03bc \u2261 12 (g \u2212 2)\u03bc . The SM prediction for a\u03bc (see Refs. [76\u201379] for reviews) depends on\nthe evaluation of QED contributions, the hadronic vacuum polarization and light-by-light\n(LBL) contributions. The evaluations of the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions\nusing e+ e\u2212 and \u03c4 decay data give somewhat different results. The latest estimate based on\ne+ e\u2212 data [80] is given by:\natheo\n= (11 659 180.5 \u00b1 4.4had \u00b1 3.5LBL \u00b1 0.2QED+EW ) \u00d7 10\u221210 ,\n\u03bc\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the source of each error is labeled. We note that the new e+ e\u2212 data sets that have\nrecently been published in Refs. [81\u201383] have been partially included in the updated estimate\nof (g \u2212 2)\u03bc .\nThe SM prediction is to be compared with the final result of the Brookhaven (g \u2212 2)\u03bc\nexperiment E821 [84], namely:\n\u221210\naexp\n,\n\u03bc = (11 659 208.0 \u00b1 6.3) \u00d7 10\n\n(29)\n\nleading to an estimated discrepancy [80, 85]\ntheo\naexp\n= (27.5 \u00b1 8.4) \u00d7 10\u221210 ,\n\u03bc \u2212 a\u03bc\n\n(30)\n\nequivalent to a 3.3-\u03c3 effect (see also Refs. [78, 86, 87]). In order to illustrate the possible\nsize of corrections, a simplified formula can be used, in which relevant supersymmetric mass\nscales are set to a common value, MSUSY = m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 = m\u03c7\u03030 = m\u03bc\u0303 = m\u03bd\u0303\u03bc .

In addition to the full one-loop contributions, the leading QED two-loop corrections\nhave also been evaluated [89]. Further corrections at the two-loop level have been obtained\n< 10%. These corin Refs. [90, 91], leading to corrections to the one-loop result that are \u223c\nrections are taken into account in our analysis according to the approximate formulae given\nin Refs. [90, 91].\n\n6\n\nFinal Predictions\n\nIn this section we present the predictions of the models FUTA and FUTB with (\u03bc > 0 and\n\u03bc < 0), whose theoretically restricted parameter space due to finiteness has been further reduced by requiring correct electroweak symmetry breaking and the absence of charge or color\n\n12\n\n\fbreaking minima. We furthermore demand that the bounds discussed in the previous section\nare also fulfilled, see the following subsections. We have performed a scan over the GUT\nscale parameters, where we take as further input the \u03c4 mass, m\u03c4 = p\n1.777 GeV. This allows\n1\n2\nus to extract the value of vu , and then, using the relation MZ = 2 (3g12/5 + g22 )(vu2 + vd2 ),\n\u221a\nvu,d = 1/ 2hHu,di, we can extract the value of vd . In this way it is possible to predict the\nmasses of the top and bottom quarks, and the value of tan \u03b2. As already mentioned, we take\ninto account the large radiative corrections to the bottom mass, see eq. (22), as well as the\nones to the tau mass. We have furthermore estimated the corrections to the top mass in our\ncase and found them to be negligible, so they are not included in our analysis. As a general\nresult for both models and both signs of \u03bc we have a heavy SUSY mass spectrum, and tan \u03b2\nalways has a large value of tan \u03b2 \u223c 44 \u2212 56.\n\n6.1\n\nResults vs. quark masses\n\nThe first low-energy constraint applied are the top- and bottom-quark masses as given in\nSect. 5.1. In Fig. 1 we present the predictions of the models concerning the bottom quark\nmass. The steps in the values for FUTA are due to the fact that fixed values of M were\ntaken, while the other parameters m5 and m10 were varied. However, this selected sampling\nof the parameter space is sufficient for us to draw our conclusions, see below.\nWe present the predictions for mb (MZ ), to avoid unnecessary errors coming from the\nrunning from MZ to the mb pole mass, which are not related to the predictions of the present\nmodels. As already mentioned in section 5.1, we estimated the effect of the unknown higher\norder corrections. For such large values of tan \u03b2, see above, in the case of FUTB for the\nbottom mass they are \u223c 8%, whereas for FUTA they can go to \u223c 30% (these uncertainties\nare slightly larger for \u03bc > 0 than for \u03bc < 0). Although these theoretical uncertainties are not\nshown in the graphs, they have been taken into the account in the analysis of mb , by selecting\nonly the values that comply with the value of the bottom mass within this theoretical error.\nFrom the bounds on the mb (MZ ) mass, we can see from Fig. 1 that the region \u03bc > 0 is\nexcluded both for FUTA and FUTB while for \u03bc < 0 both models lie partially within the\nexperimental limits.\nIn Fig. 2 we present the predictions of the models FUTA and FUTB concerning the\ntop quark pole mass. We recall that the theoretical predictions of mt have an uncertainty of\n\u223c 4% [92]. The current experimental value is given in eq. (18). This clearly favors FUTB\nwhile FUTA corresponds to mt values that are somewhat outside the experimental range,\neven taking theoretical uncertainties into account. Thus mt and mb (MZ ) together single out\nFUTB with \u03bc < 0 as the most favorable solution. From Sect. 5.6 it is obvious that \u03bc < 0 is\nalready challenged by the present data on a\u03bc . However, a heavy SUSY spectrum as we have\nhere (see above and Sect. 6.3) with \u03bc < 0 results in a aSUSY\nprediction very close to the SM\n\u03bc\nresult. Since the SM is not regarded as excluded by (g \u2212 2)\u03bc , we continue with our analysis\nof FUTB with \u03bc < 0.\n\n6.2\n\nResults for precision observables and CDM\n\nFor the remaining model, FUTB with \u03bc < 0, we compare the predictions for BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3),\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and Mh with their respective experimental constraints, see Sects. 5.2 \u2013\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 1: mb (MZ ) as function of M for models FUTA and FUTB, for \u03bc < 0 and \u03bc > 0.\n\nFigure 2: mt as function of M for models FUTA and FUTB, for \u03bc < 0 and \u03bc > 0.\n5.4. First, in Fig. 3 we show the predictions for BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) vs. BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) for all\nthe points of FUTB with \u03bc < 0. The gray (red) points in the lower left corner fulfill the\nB physics constraints as given in Sects. 5.2, 5.3. Shown also in black are the parameter points\nthat fulfill the loose CDM constraint of eq. (27), which can be found in the whole B physics\nallowed area.\nIn the second step we test the compatibility with the Higgs boson mass constraints and the\nCDM bounds. In Fig. 4 we show Mh (as evaluated with FeynHiggs [63\u201366]) as a function\nof M for FUTB with \u03bc < 0. Only the points that also fulfill the B physics bounds are\nincluded. The prediction for the Higgs boson mass is constrained to the interval Mh =\n118 . . . 129 GeV (including the intrinsic uncertainties of eq. (25)), thus fulfilling automatically\nthe LEP bounds [20, 21]. Furthermore indicated in Fig. 4 by the darker (red) points is the\nparameter space that in addition fulfills the CDM constraint as given in eq. (27). The loose\nbound permits values of M from \u223c 1000 GeV to about \u223c 3000 GeV. The strong CDM\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 3: BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) vs. BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). In green (light gray) are the points consistent\nwith the top and bottom quark masses, in red (gray) are the subset of these that fulfill the\nB physics constraints, and in black the ones that also satisfy the CDM loose constraint.\nbound, eq. (26), on the other hand, is not fulfilled by any data point, where the points with\n> 1500 GeV. As mentioned in Sect. 5.5, the\nlowest \u03a9CDM h2 \u223c 0.2 can be found for M \u223c\nCDM bounds should be viewed as \"additional\" constraints (when investigating the collider\nphenomenology). But even taking eq. (27) at face value, due to possible larger uncertainties in\nthe calculation of the SUSY spectrum as outlined above, the CDM constraint (while strongly\nreducing the allowed parameter space) does not exclude the model. Within the current\ncalculation data points which are in strict agreement with eq. (26) violate the B physics\nconstraints.\n\nFigure 4: Mh is shown as a function of M. The light (green) points fulfill the B physics\nconstraints. The darker (red) dots in addition satisfy the loose CDM constraint of eq. (27).\n\n15\n\n\f6.3\n\nThe heavy Higgs and SUSY spectrum\n\nThe gray (red) points shown in Fig. 3 are the prediction of the finite theories once confronted\nwith low-energy experimental data. In order to assess the discovery potential of the LHC [93,\n94] and/or the ILC [95\u201398] we show the corresponding predictions for the most relevant SUSY\nmass parameters. In Fig. 5 we plot the mass of the lightest observable SUSY particle (LOSP)\nas function of M, that comply with the B physics constraints, as explained above. The darker\n(red) points fulfill in addition the loose CDM constraint eq. (27). The LOSP is either the light\nscalar \u03c4 or the second lightest neutralino (which is close in mass with the lightest chargino).\nOne can see that the masses are outside the reach of the LHC and also the ILC. Neglecting\nthe CDM constraint, even higher particle masses are allowed.\n\nFigure 5: The mass of the LOSP is presented as a function of M. Shown are only points\nthat fulfill the B physics constraints. The dark (red) dots in addition also satisfy the loose\nCDM constraint of eq. (27).\nMore relevant for the LHC are the colored particles. Therefore, in Fig. 6 we show the\nmasses of various colored particles: mt\u03031 , mb\u03031 and mg\u0303 . The masses show a nearly linear depen< 2 TeV.\ndence on M. Assuming a discovery reach of \u223c 2.5 TeV yields a coverage up to M \u223c\nThis corresponds to the largest part of the CDM favored parameter space. All these particles\nare outside the reach of the ILC. Disregarding the CDM bounds, see Sect. 5.5, on the other\nhand, results in large parts of the parameter space in which no SUSY particle can be observed\nneither at the LHC nor at the ILC.\nWe now turn to the predictions for the Higgs boson sector of FUTB with \u03bc < 0. In\nFig. 7 we present the prediction for Mh vs. MA , with the same color code as in Fig. 5. We\nhave truncated the plot at about MA = 10 TeV. The parameter space allowed by B physics\nextends up to \u223c 30 TeV. The values that comply with the CDM constraints are in a relatively\n< 4000 GeV. However, taking Figs. 4 and 7 into account, the\nlight region of MA with MA \u223c\nLHC and the ILC will observe only a light Higgs boson, whereas the heavy Higgs bosons\nremain outside the LHC or ILC reach.\nThere might be the possibility to distinguish the light MSSM Higgs boson from the SM\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 6: The mass of various colored particles are presented as a function of M. Shown are\nonly points that fulfill the B physics constraints, the black ones satisfy also the loose CDM\nconstraint.\n\nFigure 7: MA vs Mh , with the same color code as in Fig. 5.\nHiggs boson by its decay characteristics. It has been shown that the ratio\nBR(h \u2192 bb\u0304)\nBR(h \u2192 W W \u2217 )\n\n(32)\n\nis the most powerful discriminator between the SM and the MSSM using ILC measurements [99,100]. We assume an experimental resolution of this ratio of \u223c 1.5% at the ILC [101].\nIn Fig. 8 we show the ratio as a function of M with the same color code as in Fig. 5. It can be\nseen that up to M <\n\u223c 2 TeV a deviation from the SM ratio of more than 3 \u03c3 can be observed.\nThis covers most of the CDM favored parameter space. Neglecting the CDM constraint, i.e.\ngoing to higher values of M, results in a light Higgs boson that is indistinguishable from a\nSM Higgs boson.\nFinally, in Tab. 3 we present a representative example of the values obtained for the SUSY\nand Higgs boson masses for Model FUTB with \u03bc < 0. The masses are typically large, as\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 8: BR(h \u2192 bb\u0304)/BR(h \u2192 W W \u2217 ) [MSSM/SM] (expressed in terms of \u03c3 with a resolution of 1.5% (see text)) is shown as a function of M. The color code is the same as in\nFig. 5.\n> 1000 GeV.\nalready mentioned, with the LOSP starting from \u223c\nIt should be kept in mind that although we present the results that are consistent with the\n(loose) CDM constraints, the present model considers only the third generation of (s)quarks\nand (s)leptons. A more complete analysis will be given elsewhere when flavor mixing will\nbe taken into account, see e.g. Ref. [38]. A similar remark concerns the neutrino masses\nand mixings. It is well known that they can be introduced via bilinear R-parity violating\nterms [103] which preserve finiteness. In this case the dark matter candidate will not be the\nlightest neutralino, but could be another one, e.g. the axion.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the present paper we have examined the predictions of two N = 1 supersymmetric and\nmoreover all-loop finite SU(5) unified models, leading after the spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Grand Unification scale to the finiteness-constrained MSSM.\nThe finiteness conditions in the supersymmetric part of the unbroken theory lead to relations among the dimensionless couplings, i.e. gauge-Yukawa unification. In addition the\nfiniteness conditions in the SUSY-breaking sector of the theories lead to a tremendous reduction of the number of the independent soft SUSY-breaking parameters leaving one model (A)\nwith three and another (B) with two free parameters. Therefore the finiteness-constrained\nMSSM consists of the well known MSSM with boundary conditions at the Grand Unification\nscale for its various dimensionless and dimensionful parameters inherited from the all-loop\nfiniteness unbroken theories. Obviously these lead to an extremely restricted and, consequently, very predictive parameter space of the MSSM.\nIn the present paper the finiteness constrained parameter space of MSSM is confronted\nwith the existing low-energy phenomenology such as the top and bottom quark masses,\n\n18\n\n\fmt\n\n172\n\nmb (MZ )\n\n2.7\n\ntan \u03b2 =\n\n46\n\n\u03b1s\n\n0.116\n\nm\u03c7\u030301\n\n796\n\nm\u03c4\u03032\n\n1268\n\nm\u03c7\u030302\n\n1462\n\nm\u03bd\u03033\n\n1575\n\nm\u03c7\u030303\n\n2048\n\n\u03bc\n\n-2046\n\nm\u03c7\u030304\n\n2052\n\nB\n\n4722\n\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b11\n\n1462\n\nMA\n\n870\n\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b12\n\n2052\n\nMH \u00b1\n\n875\n\nmt\u03031\n\n2478\n\nMH\n\n869\n\nmt\u03032\n\n2804\n\nMh\n\n124\n\nmb\u03031\n\n2513\n\nM1\n\n796\n\nmb\u03032\n\n2783\n\nM2\n\n1467\n\nm\u03c4\u03031\n\n798\n\nM3\n\n3655\n\nTable 3: A representative spectrum of FUTB with \u03bc < 0. All masses are in GeV.\nB physics observables, the bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass and constraints from the\ncold dark matter abundance in the universe. In the first step the result of our parameter\nscan of the finiteness restricted parameter space of MSSM, after applying the quark mass\nconstraints and including theoretical uncertainties at the unification scale, singles out the\nfiniteness-constrained MSSM coming from the model (B) with \u03bc < 0 (yielding (g \u2212 2)\u03bc\nvalues similar to the SM). This model was further restricted by applying the B physics\nconstraints. The remaining parameter space then automatically fulfills the LEP bounds on\nthe lightest MSSM Higgs boson with Mh = 118 . . . 129 GeV (including already the intrinsic\nuncertainties). In the final step the CDM measurements have been imposed. Considering the\nCDM constraints it should be kept in mind that modifications in the model are possible (nonstandard cosmology or R-parity violating terms that preserve finiteness) that would have only\na small impact on the collider phenomenology. Therefore the CDM relic abundance should\nbe considered as an \"additional\" constraint, indicating its possible impact. In general, a\nrelatively heavy SUSY and Higgs spectrum at the few TeV level has been obtained, where\nthe lower range of masses yield better agreement with the CDM constraint. The mass of\nthe lightest observable SUSY particle (the lightest slepton or the second lightest neutralino)\nis larger than 500 GeV, which remains unobservable at the LHC and the ILC. The charged\nSUSY particles start at around 1.5 TeV and grow nearly linearly with M. Large parts of\nthe CDM favored region results in masses of stops and sbottoms below \u223c 2.5 TeV and thus\nmight be detectable at the LHC. The measurement of branching ratios of the lightest Higgs\nboson to bottom quarks and W bosons at the ILC shows a deviation to the SM results of\n< 2.5 TeV, again covering most of the CDM favored region.\nmore than 3 \u03c3 for values of M \u223c\nIn conclusion, FUTB with \u03bc < 0, fulfilling the existing constraints from quark masses,\nB physics observables, Higgs boson searches and CDM measurements, results at a heavy\n\n19\n\n\fSUSY spectrum and large tan \u03b2. Nonetheless, colored particles are likely to be observed in\nthe range of \u223c 2 TeV at the LHC. The ILC could measure a deviation in the branching ratios\nof the lightest Higgs boson. However, neglecting the CDM constraint allows larger values of\nM. This results in a heavier SUSY spectrum, outside the reach of the LHC and the ILC. In\nthis case also the lightest Higgs boson is SM-like.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with G. Belanger, F. Boudjema and A. Djouadi. We\nthank J.
