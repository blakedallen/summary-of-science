It was Wolff (1972) who first suggested that\nsolar flares could release acoustic noise into the solar interior. Kosovichev & Zharkova (1995) simulated\nthis phenomenon for the first time, and soon after,\nKosovichev & Zharkova (1998) discovered the first seismic event, in the form of ripples, propagating away from\nthe flare of 1996 July 9. With the advancement of local helioseismic techniques such as helioseismic holography (Lindsey & Braun 2000), we have now detected numerous seismic sources of varying size and intensity produced\nby M- and X-class flares (Donea, Braun, & Lindsey 1999;\nDonea & Lindsey 2005; Donea et al. 2006; Moradi et al.\n2007; Besliu-Ionescu et al. 2007; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Oliveros et al.\n2007). Extended work on this field has also been continued by Kosovichev (2006); Zharkova & Zharkov (2007);\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Oliveros, Moradi & Donea (2008).\nDuring the impulsive phase of a flare, the coronal magnetic energy is transferred down into the photosphere and\nfurther into the solar interior. This energy is then refracted\nback to the solar surface within approximately 50 Mm of\nthe source and within an hour of the beginning of the flare.\nThe surface manifestation of this phenomenon is the ap\u22c6\n\nE-mail: Juan.Oliveros@sci.monash.edu.au\n\npearance of \"ripples\" on the solar surface, which we identify as sunquakes. It is interesting to note that the majority\nof flares do not generate sunquakes. Most large flares are\nseismically inactive, which suggests that the strong magnetic fields of the hosting active regions may substantially\nalter the behaviour of helioseismic signals emerging from below. To date, the magnetism of solar seismic regions has not\nbeen studied in depth. Braun, Duvall & Labonte (1987) and\nBraun (1995) observed that sunspots partially absorb wave\nenergy and shift the phase of the oscillations. A long line\nof theoretical developments then followed (Cally & Bogdan\n1993; Cally, Bogdan & Zweibel 1994; Bogdan & Cally 1997;\nCrouch & Cally 2003, 2005) which has shown that nearsurface conversion to slow magnetoacoustic waves is predominantly responsible for the absorption.\nFurthermore, Schunker et al. (2005) confirmed through\nobservations that magnetic forces should be of particular\nsignificance for acoustic signatures in penumbral regions,\nwhere the magnetic field is significantly inclined from vertical. Sudol & Harvey (2005) also found that a sizable proportion of magnetic field variations occur in the penumbral regions of flaring sunspots. Remarkably, the majority\nof seismic sources induced by flares are also located either\ninside, or within close proximity to the penumbra. These\nobservations possibly suggest a new mechanism which may\nbe driving seismic waves at the photospheric level. Indeed,\nHudson, Fisher & Welsch (2007) have recently introduced\nthe idea of the coupling of flare energy into a seismic wave,\nnamely the \"McClymont magnetic jerk\", produced during\n\n\f2\n\nJ. C. Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Oliveros, A.-C. Donea, P.S. Cally, H. Moradi\n\nthe impulsive phase of acoustically active flares. They estimated the mechanical work that would be done on the\nphotosphere by a sudden coronal restructuring. Their energy estimates are similar to those based on our helioseismic\nobservations.\nDuring January 11 \u2013 20 2005, AR10720 produced 5 Xclass solar flares, including an X7.1 on January 20 which produced an intense solar proton storm. However, the Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO) instrument provided helioseismic observations only for the X1.2 flare of January 15. This flare\nwas situated at N14E08 on the solar surface. The detection of the powerful seismic transient of 2005 January 15\nwas initially reported by Besliu-Ionescu et al. (2006) and\nMoradi et al. (2006a,b). The properties of the seismic waves\ngenerated by the event were later analysed by Kosovichev\n(2006). Moradi et al. (2007) (Paper I) extensively analysed\nthe sunquake of 2005 January 15 and compared the acoustic signatures with other supporting observations. They also\ncompared certain qualities exhibited by the flare with all\nother known acoustically active flares. The coincidence between strong compact acoustic source and nearby signatures\nof hard X-ray emission is remarkable. This and the spatial\ncoincidence of the acoustic emission with the sudden whitelight signature, suggests that the sudden heating of the low\nphotosphere results in seismic waves at the solar surface.\nMoradi et al. (2007) further suggested that a detailed examination of the heated magnetic photosphere is needed to\ncomplete our studies.\nIn this paper we will analyse the magneto-seismic activity of AR10720. Specifically, we shall investigate the\nrole of the photospheric and coronal magnetic fields in\ngenerating the seismic waves based on the results of\nHudson, Fisher & Welsch (2007). We will also use vector\nmagnetograms of AR10720 to analyse the evolution and dynamics of the photospheric magnetic field.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines the observational data used for our analyses. Section 3\npresents the location of the seismic source in AR10720 with\nreferences to Moradi et al. (2007) for details. Section 4 outlines the line-of-sight magnetic transients in AR10720 associated with the X1.2 solar flare. Section 5 shows the coronal\nmagnetic field reconstruction models of AR10720. In the final section, we conclude with a discussion of the magnetism\nof the seismic region based on what we have learnt from our\nanalyses.\n\n2\n\nDATA\n\nThe SOHO-MDI data consists of full-disk magnetograms obtained at a cadence of 1 minute. The MDI data sets are described in more detail by Scherrer et al. (1995). We analysed\na dataset with a period of 2 hours encompassing the flare.\nWe remapped the MDI images onto a perspective that tracks\nsolar rotation, with the region of interest fixed at the centre\nof the frame. The MDI images were then Postel-projected\nonto the frame with a nominal separation of 0.002 solar radii\n(1.4 Mm). The field of view in the MDI images analysed was\n256\u00d7256 pixels, thus incorporating a region of 500\u00d7500 Mm\non the solar surface.\nMDI-magnetogram data provides a study of the struc-\n\nFigure 1.

Additionally, we have utilised photospheric\nvector magnetograms taken by the Imaging Vector Magnetograph (IVM) instrument at Mees Solar Observatory,\nHawaii (Mickey, et al. 1996). These magnetograms provide\nthe orientation and strength of the surface magnetic field\nin AR10720. The three magnetic components are: Blos the\nline-of-sight magnetic field component, BT and BAz the two\ntransverse components in the plane perpendicular to the\nline-of-sight. The equations allowing the inversion of Stokes\nparameters introduce a 180o ambiguity on the azimuthal\ncomponent BAz which can be resolved using the method\ndescribed in Canfield et al. (1993).\nThe Imaging Vector Magnetograph (IVM) provides the\nvector magnetic field of AR10720 on January 14, 2005 at\n18:08:12 UT, six hours before the occurrence of the X1.2\nflare. Rotation and scaling were applied to align the IVM\ndata to the line-of-sight MDI magnetogram when identifying\nthe location of the seismic source on the IVM maps.\n\n3\n\nLOCATION OF THE SEISMIC SOURCE\n\nIn this section we briefly describe the main characteristics of\nthe seismic event generated by the flare of January 15, 2005.\nPaper I analysed the general properties of the seismic source\nand identified some of the (possible) triggering mechanisms\nof this sunquake.\nIn Paper I, computational seismic holography was applied to MDI dopplergram observations to image the seismic\nsource of the flare. The resulting \"egression power maps\"\n(Figure 1, left frame) showed a relatively compact seismic\nsource surrounded by some diffuse emission. The source\nwas clearly visible in 2.5 \u2013 4.5 mHz holographic images and\neven more pronounced in 5 \u2013 7 mHz images. The conspicuous\n6 mHz seismic source, indicated by the arrows in Figure 1,\nbecomes apparent near the western end of the active region\nat 00:33 UT, reaching a maximum at 00:41 UT and disappearing at 00:47 UT. The source reveals two components: a\ncompact kernel \u223c10 Mm in diameter on the magnetic neutral line and a diffuse spread, parallel to the neutral line\nlenticular component, \u223c45 Mm long (Paper I). These signatures correspond closely with other compact manifestations\n\n\fA magneto-seismic study of the active region AR10720\n\n3\n\nFigure 3. MDI l-o-s magnetic field (in G) at 00:39 UT. The\nrectangular region represent the highly seismic region of AR10720\n(seismic area)\n\nline-of-sight magnetogram of AR10720 on January 15 at\n00:39 UT. Panels c, d and e show differences between consecutive GONG+ intensity continuum images. For example,\npanel c shows the differences of GONG+ images taken at\n00:38 and 00:39 UT. The subsequent two frames show consecutive differences 1 and 2 minutes later. The right column\n(panels f, g and h) show also differences between consecutive\nMDI magnetograms. The visible continuum emission is elongated along the magnetic neutral line, corresponding closely\nwith the lenticular component of seismic emission seen at\n00:42 UT in Figure 1 (left frame). The magnetic kernels coincides with both the seismic compact source, and the lenticular component. Moradi et al. (2007) also reported that the\ncontinuum radiation into the seismic area was 2 \u00d7 1030 ergs,\nwhich is \u223c 500 times the total seismic energy we estimate\nthe flare to have emitted into the photosphere.\nFigure 2. GONG+ intensity continuum (panel a) and MDI magnetogram (panel b) images of AR10720 on 2005 January 15 at\n00:39 UT. Panels c\u2013e: differences between GONG+ intensity continuum images at the specified times. Panels f\u2013h: differences between MDI magnetogram images.\n\nof the flare (white light emission and magnetic kernels, see\nnext section). The suppression of ambient acoustic emission\nfrom the magnetic region considerably enhances the significance of the acoustic emission from the flare.\nThe powerful seismic waves produced by the sunquake\nhad amplitudes exceeding 100 m/s, propagating with an\nelliptical shape with a major axis SE \u2013 NW (Kosovichev\n2006). The total energy emitted by the 5 \u2013 7 mHz seismic source was estimated at 1027 ergs. This is about the\nsame as the seismic energy produced by the October 28\n(X17.2) flare and \u2248 200% greater than the October 29 (X10)\nflares (Donea & Lindsey 2005). Indeed, the 2005 January\n15 flare contributes to recent findings that relatively small\nflares can emit disproportionate amounts of acoustic energy\n(Donea & Lindsey 2005; Moradi et al. 2007).\nIn Figure 2 we show that the intensity continuum and\nmagnetic signatures of this flare spatially coincide. The upper panels show a GONG+ continuum image and a MDI\n\n4\n\nLOCAL MAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE\nSEISMIC REGION\n\nOnce the position of the seismic sources are found, we study\nthe structure and variation of the magnetic field at these\nlocations. This work may provide important information regarding the photospheric effects from solar flares. First, we\nanalysed l-o-s MDI magnetogram images taken during the\nseismic event. The seismic source is identified in the vicinity\nof neutral lines separating regions with opposite polarities\nof l-o-s magnetic component (box in Figure 3). Then, we extrapolated the magnetic field lines based on the photospheric\nmagnetograms.\nFigure 4 shows the variation of the photospheric magnetic field flux in the region of the seismic source (main\nkernel). A sharp decrease of the magnetic flux is observed\nduring the impulsive phase of the flare at 00:39 UT, followed\nby a gradual increase for about 10 minutes, before returning to the pre-flare magnetic flux levels. For the seismic region, when averaging Blos , we used a rectangular area of\n\u223c 539 Mm2 . These are reversible magnetic changes, similar\nto the ones discussed by Kosovichev & Zharkova (2001).\nThe magnetic transients visualised in Figure 2 (right\ncolumn) are produced by precipitation of high energy particle beams that induce their own magnetic field and also\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

We have\nalso measured transient magnetic shifts as seen in Figure 2.\nThese have also been detected in a number of flares, some\nof which were acoustically active (Kosovichev & Zharkova\n2001). The magnetic signatures are spatially and temporally\nconsistent with the acoustic signature.\nThe seismic emission occurred in a region where the\nmagnetic field is quite strong (field strengths in the range\n400 \u2013 1200 G) and where the field lines are highly inclined\n(a range of 60-80 degrees) to the vertical. For helioseismic\npurposes a strong magnetic field is certain to be important\nthroughout the photosphere and chromosphere, particularly\nin penumbral regions, where the field is significantly inclined from vertical (Schunker et al. 2005). Recent theoretical and computational modelling of magnetised subphotospheres (Cally 2006) and atmospheres (Bogdan et al. 2002)\nhas revealed that fast-to-slow (or vice versa) magnetoacoustic wave conversion occurs strongly near surfaces where the\nsound and Alfv\u00e9n speeds coincide, provided the local 'attack\nangle' of the wave vector to the magnetic field lines is fine.\nCally & Goosens (2007) have also found significant conversion to the Alfv\u00e9n wave. We will see in the next section that\nindeed, the low-lying loops are not only highly inclined but\nstrongly twisted to facilitate the accumulation of the energy\nneeded to trigger the flare.\n\nRECONSTRUCTION OF THE 3-D\nMAGNETIC FIELD\n\nThe acoustic activity of an active region is clearly related to\nthe structure of the coronal magnetic field, which facilitates\nthe precipitation of beams of non-thermal particles towards\nthe chromosphere. Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Oliveros et al. (2007) suggested\nthat the coronal magnetic field configuration (height and\nsymmetry of loops) can be a relevant factor in the generation of photospheric seismic waves. They studied the seismicity of the August 14, 2004 M7.4 solar flare, and found\nthat the seismic source was located just beneath low-lying,\nhighly-sheared magnetic field lines. This type of configuration seems to facilitate the transport of flare energy into the\nphotosphere.\nIn this work we have imaged the coronal magnetic field using potential (Sakurai 1982) and non-linear\nforce free field (NLFFF) extrapolations of the photospheric magnetic field based on the optimization method\nof Wheatland, Sturrock & Roumeliotis (2000). The NLFFF\nextrapolation of the seismic region, shows that the lower\ncorona and upper chromosphere are dominated by magnetic\nfield lines of middle and low altitude (Figure 5) which are\nhighly twisted, similar to the loops of the August 14, 2004\nflare.\nFigure 5 shows a map of the magnetic field lines extrapolated with footpoints located at or close to the seismic\nregion. The map shows an intricate network of low-lying\nmagnetic field lines parallel to the magnetic neutral lines.\nThis structure is recognizable in the Transition Region and\nCoronal Explorer (TRACE) image at 1600 \u00c5(Figure 7). The\nextrapolation was computed using the IVM vector magnetogram of January 14, taken at 18:08 UT, 6 hours prior to\nthe onset of the flare. The close match between the visible\nflaring loops in the TRACE observations and the NLFFF\nfield lines shows that the magnetic geometry did not change\ndrastically in the six hours prior to the flare.\nThe complex structure of field lines suggests that\nthe flare sequentially illuminated the magnetic loop footpoints in some erratic order but always localised in\nthe same small area. Perhaps this configuration, along\nwith the impulsive characteristics of the flare provided\nthe necessary conditions to drive this powerful sun\nquake. Complex and erratic motion of the HXR footpoints at the location of the seismic source has been\nreported before (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Oliveros, Donea & Cally 2007;\nHudson, Wolfson & Metcalf 2006; Fletcher et al. 2007).\nAlthough, the NLFFF extrapolation gives a better approximation to the real configuration of the magnetic field,\nthe magnetogram on which this method is based was obtained 6 hour prior to the flare. So, in order to obtain a\nmore general description of the magnetic field configuration before, at the maximum, and after the flare, we calculate potential magnetic field extrapolations at different\nrepresentative times, based on SOHO-MDI magnetograms\n(Figure 6). We focus our attention to the overall configuration of the magnetic field of the active region, comparing the results of the extrapolations with the observations\nmade by Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard SOHO at 195 \u00c5. We found that the extrapolations\nare dominated by high and medium altitude magnetic field\nlines, with mainly north\u2013south orientation. This distribu-\n\n\fA magneto-seismic study of the active region AR10720\n\n5\n\nFigure 5. A display of the NLFFFF magnetic field extrapolation of AR10720 overlaid on the l-o-s IVM magnetogram. An\nintricate and complex structure of low-lying magnetic field lines\nare observed over the seismic region represented by the red circle.\n\ntion of magnetic field lines are similar to those observed by\nSOHO-EIT. In figure 6 we appreciate a redistribution of the\nmagnetic field lines, that can be attribute to the reorganization of the photospheric magnetic field.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown that the seismic area in AR10720 is located\njust beneath a complex coronal loop structure with highly\ntwisted lines, which means that the photospheric impact was\nsignificant in the region where the twisting allowed a maximum storage of energy. This twisting caused the interaction\nbetween neighbouring low-lying loops, triggering the flare.\nThis can be seen in the SOHO-EIT images (Figure 6), where\nthe flaring of the loops is visible along the field lines.\nA main question we want to ask now is: how was this\nsunquake produced? That is, what was the mechanism for\ntransporting the flare energy efficiently, from the reconnection site downward into the chromosphere?\nLet us describe a number of possible mechanisms that\ncould trigger a seismic source at the photospheric level during a flare and discuss the likehood that these mechanisms\ncan explain the sunquake of the 2005 January 15 flare.\nThe first mechanism (Kosovichev & Zharkova 1998)\npropose that seismic emission into the solar interior in sunquakes is the continuation of a chromospheric shock and\ncondensation resulting from explosive ablation of the chromosphere and propagating downward through the photosphere into the underlying solar interior. Chromospheric\nshocks are well known under such circumstances, based\non red-shifted H\u03b1 emission at the flare site at the onset\nof the flare. The simulations were worked out at length\nby Fisher, Canfield & McClymont (1985a,b,c) and others\nsince. The hypothesis that the photospheric emission is\na direct continuation of such shocks was considered by\nDonea & Lindsey (2005) and Kosovichev (2006). For the\n\nFigure 6. Left column: Evolution of the coronal loops of the active region 10720 seen in the SOHO-EIT images at 195 \u00c5. Right\ncolumn: SOHO/MDI maagnetograms overlaid with the extrapolated potential magnetic field lines at the specified times.\n\nflare studied in this paper, the hydrodynamic impact of\nthe photosphere was clearly significant since, amazingly, this\nX1.2 type flare triggered a very powerful seismic source and\nvisible seismic waves (see Paper I and Kosovichev (2006)\nfor details). The spatial coincidence between the HXR emission and the seismic source leads us to connect the two processes, and conclude that the high-energy electrons played\nan important role. However, we have to look at the statistics of acoustically active events (Besliu-Ionescu et al. 2008)\nand acknowledge that most solar flares do not produce sunquakes. This leads us to believe that, for the majority of\nflares, strong radiative damping depletes the chromospheric\ntransient before its arrival at the low photosphere. Therefore, we need to look for alternative mechanisms to explain\nthe excitation of seismic sources.\nIn Paper I we proposed a second mechanism. We stated\nthat the coincidence between the locations of sudden whitelight emission and seismic emission in all acoustically active flares (including the 2005 January 15) suggests that a\nsubstantial component of the seismic emission seen is a result of sudden heating of the low photosphere associated\nwith the observed excess of visible continuum emission (radiative back-warming). The origin of white-light emission\nwould have to be entirely in the chromosphere, where energetic electrons dissipate their energy (Metcalf et al. 1990;\n\n\f6\n\nJ. C. Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Oliveros, A.-C. Donea, P.S. Cally, H. Moradi\n\nZharkova & Kobylinskii 1991, 1993), mainly by ionizing previously neutral chromospheric hydrogen approximately to\nthe depth of the temperature minimum. It appears that\nthe low photosphere itself would be significantly heated as\nwell. This is primarily the result of Balmer and Paschen\ncontinuum edge recombination radiation from the overlying ionised chromospheric medium, approximately half of\nwhich we assume radiates downward and into the underlying\nphotosphere. Donea & Lindsey (2005), Donea et al. (2006),\nand Moradi et al. (2007) have analysed this process in detail. Chen & Ding (2006) also affirm that the white-light\nflare signatures highlight the importance of radiative backwarming in transporting the energy to the low photosphere\nwhen direct heating by beam electrons is impossible.\nA\nthird\npossible\nmechanism\nproposed\nby\nZharkova & Zharkov (2007), states that high-energy\nprotons, can directly deposit energy in the photosphere,\ninducing a seismic source . However, for the flare of 2005\nJanuary 15 there is no indication of high-energy protons\nthat could directly supply the energy on which the acoustic\nemission depends. Likewise, energetic electrons consistent\nwith HXR signatures, seem to be unable to penetrate into\nthe low photosphere in anywhere near sufficient numbers\nrequired to account for the direct heating needed by the\nseismic sources (Metcalf, Canfield & Saba 1990).\nA fourth mechanism (Hudson, Fisher & Welsch 2007)\nsuggested that the \"McClymont magnetic jerk\" can account\nfor the seismic activity of some flares. Here, we want to\napply the relations of Hudson, Fisher & Welsch (2007) for\nthe seismic area of AR10720 in order to determine whether\nthe \"McClymont magnetic jerk\" can account for the seismic\nactivity of the 2005 January 15 flare.\nFor a line-of-sight MDI magnetic field change of 60 G,\nas measured in the region where the main kernel of the\nacoustic seismic appeared (area \u223c 6 Mm \u00d7 9 Mm), the\ntotal Lorentz force, for Bz \u223c 400 G, is 2 \u00d7 1021 dyne\n(\u03b4fz \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 103 dyne/cm2 * 1.2 \u00d7 1018 cm2 ). In Paper I\nwe observed that the photospheric impact produced a depression of about 10 km. Using this, the maximum work\ndone by the Lorentz force on the photosphere is estimated\nat \u223c 2 \u00d7 1027 ergs, which is twice the energy needed by the\nentire seismic source to oscillate at a frequency centered at\n6 mHz within a 2 mHz band. From Paper I we extract that\nthe seismic kernel accounted for \u223c 45% of the total egression\npower (estimated at \u223c 1 \u00d7 1027 ergs) integrated over the region encompassing the entire flare signature (kernel plus the\nlenticular diffuse component). Of course, the inferred number is just an upper limit based on many uncertainties of the\nlocal physics. We conclude that the \"McClymont magnetic\njerk\" may explain the formation of the acoustic kernel, but\ndoes not explain the diffuse lenticular element of seismic\nactivity surrounding the main kernel, which is distributed\nalong the neutral line up to \u223c15 Mm east and \u223c30 Mm\nwest of the kernel (Moradi et al. 2007). The fact that the\nerratic motion of the HXR sources is observed only above\nthe acoustic kernelled area sustains this assumption.\nWe note that if integrating over the full area of the seismic source (including the diffuse lenticular acoustic emission\nsurrounding the main kernel) the change in magnetic field\nis very small (about 5 G), which is understandable, because\nthe full area of the seismic source spans negative and positive\nmagnetic polarities. The area is also permeated by field lines\n\nFigure 7. TRACE image at 1600 \u00c5taken at 00:12:35 UT. The\nobservable feature in the image resembles the structure observed\nin the extrapolation.\n\nfrom loops of different orientation, making the local magnetic geometry much more complicated. We also emphasize\nthat the seismic area of the solar flare of 2005 January 15 has\nmagnetic loops of a very large inclination angle, positioning\nthe reconnection site close to photospheric levels.\nAccording\nto\nHudson\n(2000)\nand\nHudson, Fisher & Welsch (2007), one expects that the\nfield in the photosphere should become \"more horizontal\",\nas a result of the coronal magnetic field contraction that\nfollows the decrease in the coronal magnetic energy. Limited\nby the existing observations, we cannot say whether the\noverall field structure of AR10720 had tilted even more\nduring the flaring. Clearly, we cannot definitively affirm\nthat for this complicated structure of AR10720 the Lorentz\nforce is the main triggering mechanism for this quake (we\nremind the reader that the X1.2 flare of 2005 January 15\ngenerated the most powerful solar seismic source detected\nso far). We believe that in reality, a combination of all the\nabove mechanisms may be required to describe the entire\nphenomenon.\nFor simpler magnetic field configurations, where seismic sources have been also identified (Donea & Lindsey\n2005; Donea et al. 2006) as localised acoustic kernels at\nthe location of moving hard X-ray footpoints, we expect\nthe \"McClymont jerk\" mechanism to work efficiently in\nparallel with the chromospheric shocks driven by sudden,\nthick-target heating of the upper and middle chromosphere\n(Kosovichev & Zharkova 1998; Donea & Lindsey 2005) and\nthe \"back-warming\" mechanism.\n\nREFERENCES\nBesliu-Ionescu, D., Donea, A.-C.,Lindsey, C., Cally, P.
