Recent spectro-polarimetric observations have provided detailed measurements of magnetic field, velocity and\nintensity during events of magnetic field intensification in the solar photosphere.\nAims. By comparing with synthetic observations derived from MHD simulations, we aim to discern the physical processes underlying the observations, as well as to verify the simulations and the interpretation of the observations.\nMethods. We consider the temporal evolution of the relevant physical quantities for three cases of magnetic field intensification in a numerical simulation. In order to compare with observations, we calculate Stokes profiles and take into\naccount the spectral and spatial resolution of the spectropolarimeter (SP) on board Hinode. We determine the evolution\nof the intensity, magnetic flux density and zero-crossing velocity derived from the synthetic Stokes parameters, using\nthe same methods as applied to the Hinode/SP observations to derive magnetic field and velocity information from the\nspectro-polarimetric data.\nResults. The three events considered show a similar evolution: advection of magnetic flux to a granular vertex, development of a strong downflow, evacuation of the magnetic feature, increase of the field strength and the appearance of\nthe bright point. The magnetic features formed have diameters of 0.1-0.2\u2032\u2032 . The downflow velocities reach maximum\nvalues of 5-10 km/s at \u03c4 = 1. In the largest feature, the downflow reaches supersonic speed in the lower photosphere. In\nthe same case, a supersonic upflow develops approximately 200 s after the formation of the flux concentration. We find\nthat synthetic and real observations are qualitatively consistent and, for one of the cases considered, agree very well\nalso quantitatively. The effect of finite resolution (spatial smearing) is most pronounced in the case of small features,\nfor which the synthetic Hinode/SP observations miss the bright point formation and also the high-velocity downflows\nduring the formation of the smaller magnetic features.\nConclusions. The observed events are consistent with the process of field intensification by flux advection, radiative\ncooling, and evacuation by strong downflow found in MHD simulations. The quantitative agreement of synthetic and\nreal observations indicates the validity of both the simulations and the interpretations of the spectro-polarimetric\nobservations.\nKey words. Sun: photosphere, Sun: granulation, Sun: magnetic fields\n\n1. Introduction\nMagnetic field is ubiquitously present in the solar photosphere (de Wijn et al. 2008). On granular scales, it undergoes continual deformation and displacement. It is swept by\nthe horizontal flows and concentrated in the intergranular\nlanes. Flows are able to compress the field so that the magnetic energy density B 2 /8\u03c0 approaches the kinetic energy\ndensity \u03c1v 2 /2 of the flow (Parker 1963; Weiss 1966). This\nresults in a magnetic field strength of a few hundred Gauss\nat the solar surface. Further intensification to kG strength\nis driven by the mechanism referred to as: superadiabatic\neffect (Parker 1978), convective collapse (Webb & Roberts\n1978; Spruit & Zweibel 1979) or convective intensification\n(Grossmann-Doerth et al. 1998).\nThe first two concepts are a theoretical idealization of\nthe process. The superadiabatic effect contains the basic\nidea. Parker (1978) pointed out that a thermally isolated\ndowflowing gas within the flux tube in a superadiabatically\nstratified environment will be accelerated, which would lead\nto evacuation of the flux tube. Because of the resulting pres-\n\nsure deficit, the gas inside the flux tube will then be pressed\ntogether (together with the frozen-in magnetic field) by\nthe surrounding gas, causing the magnetic pressure to increase until a balance of total pressure (magnetic + gas) is\nreached.\nThe convective collapse extents the concept to the convective instability. It starts with a flux tube in thermal\nand mechanical equilibrium with the surrounding hydrostatically superadiabaticly stratified plasma. Since external\nstratification is convectively unstable, any vertical motion\nwithin the flux tube can be amplified. Downward flow will\ngrow in amplitude and drain the material from the flux\ntube. The process continues until a new equilibrium with\na strong field is reached. Different aspects of the concept\nhave been the subject of extensive research (see Sch\u00fcssler\n1990; Steiner 1999, for reviews). The term convective intensification is used for magnetic field intensification in realistic MHD simulations, where the process occurs in its\nfull complexity. It is driven by the thermal effect in the\nsurface layer of the magnetic concentration. There, due to\nthe presence of magnetic field, heat transport by convection\n\n\f2\n\nS. Danilovic et al.: Magnetic field intensification: 3D MHD vs. Hinode/SP\n\nFig. 1. Maps of the whole simulation domain at t = 140 s. Normalized continuum intensity at 630 nm(left), vertical\ncomponent of magnetic field (middle) and velocity (right) at a geometrical height roughly corresponding to the level of\nh\u03c4500 i = 1 (\u2248 930 km above the bottom of the computational box).\nis reduced. The material inside the concentration radiates\nmore that it receives. This leads to cooling of material which\nthus starts to sink and partial evacuation of the concentration occurs. Contraction of the magnetic concentration by\nthe surroundings (result of the pressure imbalance) leads\nto an increase in magnetic field strength. Thus, the simulations (Nordlund 1983; Grossmann-Doerth et al. 1998;\nGadun et al. 2001; V\u00f6gler et al. 2005; Cheung et al. 2008)\nbear out the basic properties described by idealized concepts. That is the downflow, the evacuation of the magnetic\nstructure, the field increase and, in some cases, establishment of a new equilibrium. The 3D MHD simulations show\nthat the strong magnetic concentrations form as the horizontal flows in the intergranular lanes advect weak, nearly\nvertical field and concentrate it at the vertices of granular and mesogranular downflow lanes (Stein & Nordlund\n1998, 2006). Larger magnetic structures form at sites where\na granule submerges and the surrounding field is pushed\ninto the resulting dark region. Whether the formed concentration appears dark or bright in the continuum intensity\ndepends on whether the vertical cooling is compensated\nor not by the lateral heating due to horizontal energy exchange (Bercik et al. 2003; V\u00f6gler et al. 2005). This formation scenario is consistent with the observations described\nby Muller (1983) and Muller & Roudier (1992). Their observations show that network bright points form in intergranular spaces, at the junction of converging granules as\nthe magnetic field gets compressed by the converging granular flow.\nThe 2D simulations by Grossmann-Doerth et al. (1998)\nrevealed that magnetic flux concentrations formed by convective intensification can evolve in different ways. They\npresent two possible outcomes. Depending on the initial magnetic flux, a magnetic concentration can reach a\nstable state after the process, or can be dispersed due\nto an upflow that develops as high speed downflowing\nmaterial rebounces from the dense bottom of the tube.\nSimilar results were presented by Takeuchi (1999) and\nSheminova & Gadun (2000).\n\nObservational evidence was found for both cases.\nBello Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2008) reported on the formation of\na magnetic feature at the junction of intergranular lanes,\nwithout any significant upflow observed. Bellot Rubio et al.\n(2001), on the other hand, detected a strongly blueshifted\nStokes V profile originating in a upward propagating\nshock, 13 minutes after the amplification of magnetic field.\nSocas-Navarro & Manso Sainz (2005) found that supersonic upflows are actually quite common.\nEvents that are interpreted as convective collapse were\ndetected also with the spectropolarimeter (SP) (Lites et al.\n2001) of the Solar Optical telescope (Tsuneta et al. 2008)\non board Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007). Both, Shimizu et al.\n(2008) and Nagata et al. (2008) show cases of high\nspeed downflows followed by magnetic field intensification and bright point appearance. The event described by\nNagata et al. (2008) shows stronger field strength and upflow in the final phase of evolution.\nIn this paper we give three examples of magnetic field\nintensification from MURaM simulations and make detailed\ncomparison with the results of Nagata et al. (2008) and\nShimizu et al. (2008).\n\n2. Simulation data and spectral synthesis\nWe use 3D radiative MHD simulations of a thin layer containing the solar surface carried out with the MURaM code\n(V\u00f6gler 2003; V\u00f6gler et al. 2005) in a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1.68 Mm\ndomain with non-grey radiative transfer included. Vertical\nand horizontal spatial resolution is 10 km and 14 km respectively. The bottom and top boundaries are open, permitting free in and outflow of matter. The initial magnetic\nfield of h|B|i = 200 G, is introduced in a checkerboard-like\n2 \u00d7 2 pattern, with opposite polarity in adjacent parts. As\nthe field is redistributed by convective motions, opposite\npolarities are pushed together and dissipated, so that the\nunsigned magnetic flux decreases with time. In this way,\nthe run simulates the decay of the magnetic field in a mixed\npolarity region. Local dynamo action (V\u00f6gler & Sch\u00fcssler\n\n\fS.

We do not expect\nthat the intensification process would be significantly different at higher Reynolds numbers (smaller grid cells). The\nsimulated magnetic flux concentrations considered here are\nwell resolved. The main effect of an increased resolution\nwould be a decrease in the width of the boundary layers\nbetween the flux concentration and the surrounding downflows.\nWe examine a 30 min sequence of simulation snapshots\nwith a cadence of approximately 90 s. The snapshots shown\nin this paper have h|B|i \u2248 150 G at \u03c4 = 1. In Fig. 1, we\nshow the continuum image and maps of the vertical components of the magnetic field and velocity for a snapshot\nat time t = 140 s (t = 0 s corresponds to the first snapshot\nconsidered in this paper).\nIn order to synthesize the Stokes profiles, the physical\nparameters from the simulation are used as an input for the\n1D LTE radiative transfer code, SPINOR (Frutiger et al.\n\n2000). A spectral range that contains Fe I lines 630.15 and\n630.25 nm is sampled in steps of 7.5 m\u00c5. The Fe abundance used for the synthesis has been taken from Thevenin\n(1989) and the values of the oscillator strengths from the\nVALD database (Piskunov et al. 1995). Before comparing\nwith Hinode/SP (Lites et al. 2001) observations, the synthetic line profiles have been treated to bring them to the\nsame resolution as Hinode data. Firstly, a realistic point\nspread function PSF (Danilovic et al. 2008) has been applied to the synthesized Stokes profiles. The PSF takes\ninto account the basic optical properties of the Hinode\nSOT/SP system and a slight defocus which brings the continuum contrast of the simulation to the observed value of\n7.5%. Secondly, to take into account spectral resolution of\nthe spectropolarimeter, the profiles are convolved with a\nGaussian function of 25 m\u00c5 FWHM and resampled to a\nwavelength spacing of 21.5 m\u00c5. Thirdly, noise of 10\u22123 Ic\nis added. Velocities are determined from the shift between\nthe Stokes V zero-crossing wavelength and the line core\n\n\f4\n\nS.

(2008) is\nused to calculate the longitudinal apparent magnetic flux\ndensity (shown in Fig. 2).\n\n3. Results\nFig. 2 shows the evolution of the continuum intensity and\nthe magnetic field in a 2.9 \u00d7 2.2 Mm subdomain of the\nsimulation, over approximately 7 minutes. Shown are maps\nat the original resolution of the simulation (left-hand side)\nand at the spatial resolution of Hinode (right-hand side).\nFor the original resolution, we show the vertical component of the magnetic field from the simulations (right column on the left-hand side). The longitudinal apparent flux\ndensity (Lites et al. 2008) retrieved from synthetic Stokes\nprofiles is shown at the Hinode resolution (right column on\nthe right-hand side). During the period shown, three bright\npoints appear near the coordinates [2\u2032\u2032 , 1.5\u2032\u2032 ], [0.5\u2032\u2032 , 1\u2032\u2032 ] and\n[3.5\u2032\u2032 , 1\u2032\u2032 ], in the regions outlined by yellow squares. We refer to them here as cases I, II and III, respectively. They\nare identified in the top left frame.\n3.1. Horizontal flows\nIn all three cases, magnetic field is advected by the flow to\nthe junction of multiple granules, where it is confined and\nconcentrated. The evolution of magnetic concentrations is\n\nexamined more closely in Fig. 3, where the regions outlined by yellow squares in Fig. 2, are enlarged. Horizontal\nvelocities, at approximately 80 km above h\u03c4 i = 1, are represented by arrows in continuum maps and magnetograms.\nRegions with a strong vertical component of vorticity are\nalso outlined.\nVortex flows around strong downflows are quite common in simulations of granulation (Nordlund 1986). They\nare formed at the vertices between multiple granules, where\nflows converge and angular velocities with respect to the\ncenter of downflow increase due to angular momentum conservation. The lifetime of vortex flows depends on the dynamical behavior of the neighboring granules. In a 30 min\nrun that we examined, they last from less then 90 s to\napproximately 10 min. The ones shown in Fig. 3 are shortlived. In case II, the swirling motion persists for at least 150\ns, until the shape of the neighboring granules is changed.\nThe formed flux concentration is then squeezed between\ntwo granules and stretched into a flux-sheet-like feature.\nLater on, as the granules evolve, the magnetic feature is advected to the left and trapped again in the junction between\nnewly formed granules. In case III, a strong preexisting flux\nsheet is carried by the flow toward the junction of the granules. There, the field is caught in a vortex flow that lasts\nfor at least 100 s. The flow becomes disturbed and then\nstarts to swirl in the opposite direction. The vortex axes\nare inclined, in both cases II and III, with respect to the\nvertical direction. Also in both cases, there is a spatial and\ntemporal coincidence between the existence of vortex flows\nand the formation of high speed downflows near the surface\nlayer.\nThe vortices shown in Fig. 3 are less then 0.25\u2032\u2032 in diameter, much smaller then the ones found in observations\n(Bonet et al. 2008). The size of the observed vortex flows is\nof order 1\u2032\u2032 and the average lifetime is around 5 min. They\nseem to outline supergranulation and mesogranulation cells.\nAs the authors of the observational study suggest, most vortices could have been missed because of the limited spatial\nresolution (Swedish Solar Telescope) and the method used\n(tracking the motion of bright points in G band). A shortlived vortex flow preceding formation of a network bright\npoint has been observed by Roudier et al. (1997).\nNo vortex is detected during the formation of flux concentration in the case I. In this case, a strong downflow, and\nlater upflow develops inside the flux concentration, whose\nshape and contrast in the intensity map is greatly affected\nby the convective motions. Spatial and temporal fluctuations across the magnetic feature make it difficult to define\nits center. The bright points, visible in continuum maps,\nform where fragments of flux concentrations become narrow so that lateral heating becomes important and in the\nregions with higher field strength, i.e. higher evacuation.\nDuring their further evolution after the intensification\nphase (t > 420 s), the flux concentrations in cases I, II and\nIII have different fates. In case II, it meets a magnetic feature of opposite polarity and vanishes in \u223c 3 minutes. The\nfeature formed in case I is gradually stretched by the flow\nand fragmented after approximately 9 minutes. A few minutes after that, the larger fragment encounters the oppositepolarity flux concentration from case III. The cancellation\ncontinues for \u223c 12 minutes until both features disappear.\nThe smaller fragment of the feature from case I is caught in\na granular vortex flow approximately 5 minutes later which\nleads to further intensification.\n\n\fS.

Time sequence of\nvertical cuts through the\nmagnetic concentration corresponding to case I (positions of the cuts are marked\nby yellow horizontal lines\nin right-hand images in\nFig. 2). The plotted cuts\ncorrespond to the same instances of time as sampled in Fig. 2. From left\nto right: density excess with\nrespect to the the mean\ndensity at every height, vertical component of magnetic field, vertical component of velocity (overplotted arrows show the components of the velocity field\nin the x-z plane), and radiative heating rate. Horizontal\nsolid lines follow the levels\nof log \u03c4 = 0, \u22121 and \u22122.\nVertical dashed lines mark\nthe position of the height\nprofiles given in Fig. 5.\n3.2. Field intensification\nThe evolution of the magnetic structures formed during the\nstudied time interval can be followed in more detail by taking vertical slices through the regions marked by horizontal\nlines in Fig. 3. We will examine three cases.\n3.2.1. Case I\nVertical cuts through the regions corresponding to this case\nare given in Fig. 4. Shown are the density excess (relative to\nthe mean density at each geometrical height), the vertical\ncomponents of magnetic field and velocity, and the radiative heating rate. Cuts at the instant t = 0 show the fluctuation in density outlining the granulation structure, with\nless dense, hotter granules and a cooler intergranular lane,\nwhere magnetic field of a few hundred G is accumulated and\na downflow of a few km/s is present. The fluctuation in radiative heating rate is highest in the thin layer near optical\ndepth unity, where upflowing granular material cools most\nstrongly. The regions along the intergranular lane seems\nto undergo cooling in the layers above \u03c4 = 1. In the next\ninstant, 140 s later, a strong magnetic concentration has\nalready formed. Variations in magnetic field strength at\na given geometrical height are accompanied by variations\nin the gas pressure. Regions with increased field strength\nhave lower density, which, in turn, shifts the level of opti-\n\ncal depth unity downwards relative to neighboring regions\nwith weaker field. The depression of the visible surface inside the magnetic structure gives rise to radiative heating\nthrough the sidewalls from the hot neighboring material.\nThe downflow velocity is significantly increased from t = 0\nto t = 140 s, becoming supersonic in the layer between 100\nkm above and 350 km below the surface. By t = 280 s it\nis greatly diminished again inside the flux concentration.\nThe diameter and the shape of the flux concentration continuously evolves and does not reach a stationary state.\nAt t = 280 s strong radiative heating is present inside the\nconcentration. This is also the moment when continuum\nintensity is the highest as shown later (Fig. 9).\nIn the last two sets of snapshots, shown in Fig. 4, an\nupflow is visible inside the flux concentration, extending almost from the bottom of the simulation domain. It reaches\nsupersonic velocities in the upper layers of the photosphere.\nIts direction is inclined with respect to the vertical. The\nupflowing material inside the concentration exhibits strong\ncooling at the surface. As the material refills the region inside the flux concentration, the level of optical depth unity\nshifts upwards and the magnetic field strength decreases.\nHowever, the upflow does not lead to a complete dispersal\nof the field, as described in the last paragraph of Sec. 3.1.\nThe evolution of this flux concentration is further illustrated by the vertical profiles given in Fig. 5. Three phases\n\n\f6\n\nS. Danilovic et al.: Magnetic field intensification: 3D MHD vs. Hinode/SP\n\nFig. 5. Height profiles of various quantities in the flux concentration corresponding to the case I (magnetic field, vertical component of velocity, density and temperature) at\nthe positions marked by dashed lines in Fig. 4 at different\ntime instances. Thick vertical lines mark the positions of\nthe optical depth \u03c4500 = 1 for each atmosphere. Thin vertical lines in the top two panels mark the positions of the\nheight of formation of Fe I 630.25 nm line (see text).\n\nbefore and after the field intensification are shown. The\nhorizontal positions of the profiles are marked by vertical dashed lines in Fig. 4. The profiles of magnetic field\nstrength, vertical component of velocity, density and temperature for each phase are shown, together with the corresponding level of optical depth unity, marked by thick\nvertical lines. The level h = 0 corresponds to the level of\nthe mean optical depth unity h\u03c4500 i = 1 for the whole snapshot. Thin vertical lines in the upper plots mark the position of the average height of formation of the Fe I 630.25\nnm line, which is defined by calculating the centroid of\nthe contribution function (CF) for line intensity depression\n(Solanki & Bruls 1994), at the wavelength of the line core.\nThe definition gives only a rough estimate of the heights\nsampled, since the lines are formed over a large portion of\nthe photosphere and the CFs are asymmetric in wavelength\ndue to the presence of high velocity gradients.\nThe figure shows that, in the interval from t = 0 s to\nt = 140 s, the downflow extends to deeper layers and increases in amplitude, reaching 10 km/s at 200 km below\nthe surface. The magnetic field strength increases from a\nfew hundred to more than 2000 G at the level of \u03c4500 = 1.\nThe significant reduction in density results in a shift of 200\nkm in the optical depth unity level. As a result of radiative\nheating the temperature gradient is flatter and the temperature is around 400 K higher at h = 0. The temperature\ndifference at equal optical depth is even larger, exceeding\n1000 K at \u03c4500 = 1. The estimated height of formation of\nFe I 6302 shifts from roughly 300 km to 150 km above the\nsurface when magnetic field concentration forms, which is\nin agreement with Khomenko & Collados (2007). This effect contributes to the increase of observed magnetic field\nstrength in the first two phases.\n\nFig. 7. The same as Fig. 5, but for case II.\n\nFig. 8. The same as Fig. 5, but for case III.\nIn the third phase, the upflow leads to a density enhancement and a weakening of the magnetic field by a\nfew hundred Gauss in the lower photosphere. The level of\n\u03c4500 = 1 shifts upward by 100 km. No discontinuity is visible in the vertical component of velocity, in contrast to the\nevent studied by Grossmann-Doerth et al. (1998).\n3.2.2. Cases II and III\nVertical cuts through the regions corresponding to these\ncases are shown in Fig. 6. The positions of the cuts are\nmarked by horizontal lines in Fig. 3. The parameters shown\nare the same as in Fig. 4.\nAt t = 0, weak magnetic structures in the intergranular\nlanes are already present in both cases. Strong downflows\nalong the magnetic field lines persist over the entire time\ninterval shown. They reach supersonic velocities in some instances, but only in the layers below \u03c4 = 1. In case II, the\n\n\fS. Danilovic et al.: Magnetic field intensification: 3D MHD vs. Hinode/SP\n\n7\n\nFig. 6. The same as Fig. 4\nbut for cases II and III.\nEach frame is subdivided\ninto a left part displaying\ncase II and a right part\nshowing case III. Vertical\nlines mark the positions of\nthe height profiles given in\nFig. 7 and Fig. 8.\ndownflow is strongest at t = 140 s, just before the vortex\nflow becomes deformed owing to evolution of the neighboring granule. Then it gets somewhat reduced at t=280s, as\nthe structure is squeezed between the granules. Later, at\nt = 380 s, a strong downflow is present again in the newly\nformed granular junction, to which the flux concentration\nis carried and where it is confined again. The rightmost\ncolumns show strong cooling of the layers above the level\nof \u03c4500 = 1 in both cases. At t = 420 s, the interior of the\nflux concentrations reaches radiative equilibrium. At that\nmoment, the flux concentrations in both cases are almost\nvertical, with diameters of approximately 0.1\u2032\u2032 at \u03c4500 = 1.\nFigures 7 and 8 show height profiles along the positions\nmarked by the dashed lines in Fig. 6. Since the flux concentrations are inclined, the choice of curved lines, along the\naxes of magnetic structures, would be more logical here.\nHowever, we are interested in what would be observed at\nthe disc center and the observables (i.e. the Stokes profiles)\ndepend on the vertical profiles of the physical parameters\nwhich are shown here. In the case II, we choose to show\nprofiles at instants t = 0, 280 and t = 420 s (solid, dotted,\ndashed respectively). For the case III, profiles at the last\nthree instants from Fig. 6 are shown. Both cases exhibit\na similar behavior: there is a significant evacuation of the\nmagnetic concentration due to the strong downflow and an\nincrease of the magnetic field strength from a few hundred\n\nG to kG values in the process. There is a persistent dowflow\nthat reaches 5 km/s (in the vertical direction) at \u03c4500 = 1\nand a decrease in density with a corresponding shift in the\nheight of \u03c4500 = 1. In both cases, the shift in \u03c4500 = 1\nreaches 150 km and the magnetic field strength increases\nto 2000 G at that depth. The height of formation of the\nFe I 630.25 nm line shifts to deeper layers as the magnetic\nfield strength increases. In the last instant, the Fe I 630.25\nnm line probes layers with kG fields and vertical velocity\nof 5 km/s, in both cases.\n3.3. Comparison with synthetic Hinode observations\nThe intensity contrast is considerably reduced at Hinode\nspatial resolution, as can be seen in Fig. 2 (note that the\ncolor scales are adjusted). The maps of longitudinal apparent magnetic flux density are shown for comparison with\nthe magnetograms at the original resolution. Fine structure in both maps, continuum and magnetograms, is lost\ndue to smearing. The bright points that correspond to cases\nII and III are barely discernible.\n3.3.1. Case I\nIn order to compare case I with the results of Shimizu et al.\n(2008), we calculate the parameter they refer to as signal\n\n\f8\n\nS.

Vertical component of magnetic field and velocity at log \u03c4500 = \u22122 (for\noriginal resolution) are each plotted together with the longitudinal apparent magnetic flux density (note the separate scale\nemployed for BL\napp in the middle column) and velocity retrieved from Stokes V profiles (Hinode resolution), respectively.\n\nFig. 10.

It is defined as the Stokes V profile integrated\nover the spectral range of 250 \u2212 400 m\u00c5 redward from the\n\nnominal line center. This wavelength range corresponds to\ndowflows of 7 \u2212 14 km/s, so that high values of SE indicate\nthe presence of hight-speed downflows. The red contour in\nthe right-hand side of Fig. 2 outlines a region with SE of\n0.01 pm, which is a factor of 10 higher than in the surroundings. It fits the location and time of the strong downflows\nvisible at the original resolution (left hand-side of Fig. 2).\nBoth, synthesized (here) and observed (Shimizu et al. 2008)\nSE occur simultaneously with the appearance of the bright\npoint and the intensification of the magnetic field. However,\nthe event described by Shimizu et al. (2008) (Fig. 8) lasts\nat least 6 minutes, while in our simulations it is present for\nless than 4 minutes.\nFigure 9 compares the observable parameters with the\ncorresponding values at original resolution. The locations\nchosen for the plots are marked by yellow crosses in Fig. 2.\nThe pixels are selected such that regions of downflow and\nupflow are covered, as well as the evolution of the bright\npoint. The plots show the temporal change of normalized\nintensity, longitudinal apparent flux density (Lites et al.\n2008), and zero-crossing velocity retrieved from Stokes V\nprofiles of the Fe I 630.25 nm line, so that a direct comparison with the results of Nagata et al. (2008) can be made.\nOverplotted (stars/solid lines) are the normalized intensity\nat the original resolution, the vertical component of magnetic field and velocity at log \u03c4500 = \u22122.\nThe comparison shows that the correlation between the\nparameters at original and reduced resolution is not so\n\n\fS. Danilovic et al.: Magnetic field intensification: 3D MHD vs. Hinode/SP\n\ngood. This is a consequence of different effects. Firstly,\nsince the formation region of the Fe I 630 nm lines extends over a large part of the atmosphere, there is smearing\nalong the line of sight and the resulting profiles carry information from different layers with different values of the\nphysical parameters. Secondly, the smearing due to spatial\nresolution affects every pixel differently depending on its\nneighboring pixels. The profiles could be more asymmetric\nand broader due to averaging over inhomogeneous regions\nand the amplitude of Stokes V can be affected. Figure 10\nshows examples of Stokes I and V profile at original and\nreduced resolution at t = 0, 140 and 420 s. The profiles\nshow stronger asymmetries and higher Doppler shifts at\noriginal resolution. The amplitudes of Stokes V profiles at\nHinode resolution are reduced by a factor of 10. They are\nof the same order of magnitude as the observed ones (Fig.\n2 of Nagata et al. (2008)). Both, synthesized and observed\nStokes I profiles show an extended red wing at the phase\nwith strong downflow.\nFigure 9 reveals that intensity contrast is significantly\nreduced by spatial smearing. Thus at t = 230 s the contrast\nof the bright point drops from 100% at original resolution\nto below 30% at the reduced resolution. The velocity determined from Stokes V profiles is at most times somewhat\nlower than the velocities at log \u03c4500 = \u22122. However, the\ngeneral trends of the parameters are preserved. For both,\nsimulation and observation (Nagata et al. 2008), the intensity reaches its maximum approximately 100 s later than\nvelocity. This is consistent with the idea that the enhanced\nbrightness results from the evacuation due to the downflow. When the velocity changes sign, the brightness starts\nto fade. The maximum brightness of the simulated and observed bright points are similar after degrading the simulated intensity to Hinode resolution, while the velocities\nderived from the simulations are consistent, but somewhat\nsmaller. They reach approximately 5 km/s (downflow) and\n0.5 km/s (upflow), while values up to 6 km/s and 2 km/s,\nrespectively, are observed. The magnetic field strength obtained by Nagata et al. (2008), by inversions, increases from\na few hundred to 2000 G in approximately 200 s, which is\nin agreement with simulations.\n3.3.2. Cases II and III\nThe middle and bottom rows in Figure 9 show the temporal evolution for cases II and III, respectively. We find a\nsimultaneous increase in all parameters (continuum intensity, apparent flux density and zero-crossing velocity). In\nboth cases, the downflow is suppressed at t = 280 s possible because of the evolution of the surrounding granules.\nThe velocity at log \u03c4500 = \u22122 reaches 6 and 4 km/s for\ncase II and III, respectively. As the magnetic field strength\nincreases, the intensity follows and, in both cases, the intensity contrast reaches 50% with respect to the mean at\noriginal resolution.\nThe influence of spatial smearing is on the whole similar,\nalthough a few differences relative to case I are noteworthy.\nFirstly, due to the small size of the features, the correlation\nof the magnetic and brightness signals is largely destroyed.\nAlthough the magnetic signals are comparable to the values\nin case I, the brightness is lower, so that the features are inconspicuous in continuum images. The increase in magnetic\nflux density is followed by just a small fluctuation in intensity. Secondly, although the magnetic field strengths and\n\n9\n\ndiameters of the features are comparable for cases II and\nIII at original resolution, the case II shows lower magnetic\nflux density after convolution. Thirdly, the signature of the\nstrong dowflow in case II is lost due to spatial smearing.\n\n4. Summary\nOur case study of three examples of magnetic field intensification has shown that in all three cases, the field is advected\nto the junction of several granules. There, it is confined\nby converging granular flows, which, in two cases, form a\nvortex. Owing to the presence of the magnetic field, the\nthermal effect (radiative cooling) induces evacuation of the\nflux concentration. The evacuation leads to a downward\nshift of the optical depth scale within the flux concentrations. The shift is smaller for the smaller features due to\nthe lateral radiative heating, which inhibits further evacuation (Venkatakrishnan 1986). As a result, the magnetic\nfield at \u03c4 = 1, in the smaller features, is weaker than in the\ncase of the feature with more flux. This is in accordance\nwith recent numerical (Cheung et al. 2007) and observational (R\u00fcedi et al. 1992; Solanki et al. 1996) results.\nDuring the evacuation, the dowflow velocities reach\nmaximum values of 5-10 km/s at \u03c4 = 1. In the case of\nthe largest feature, the downflow extends from the upper\nboundary of the simulation domain and becomes supersonic\nin the lower photosphere. The magnetic features formed\nhave diameters of 0.1-0.2 \u2032\u2032 . In the case of the biggest feature, a supersonic upflow develops approximately 200 s after the formation of the flux concentration. The upflow does\nnot lead to a complete dispersal of the field, but the feature\npersists until 9 minutes later when it undergoes a fragmentation. The disappearance of the features in all three cases\noccurs when they meet opposite polarity features, between\n3 and 20 minutes after their formation.\nWe also show what happens with the observables when\nthe effects of smearing to observational spatial resolution is\ntaken into account. An important result is that, in the case\nof small features, Hinode/SP would miss the bright point\nformation and, in some cases, also the high velocity downflows that develop in the process. On the other hand, the\nsignatures of the evolution of large features are detectable\neven after the spatial smearing. We show that this case\ncan be quantitatively compared with Hinode/SP observation (Nagata et al. 2008; Shimizu et al. 2008) and exhibits\na very similar evolution. This suggests that the magnetic\nfield intensification process in the MURaM simulations is a\nfaithful description of the process taking place on the Sun.\nFurthermore, our study indicates that the analysis and interpretation of the observations in terms of the convective\nintensification process is well-founded.\nAcknowledgements.
