Introduction\n\nThe family of quasi-one-dimensional mixed valent vanadium oxides \u03b2-A0.33 V2 O5 (A=Li, Na, Ag, Ca, Sr, and\nPb) exhibit a variety of exotic phenomena such as metalinsulator transition, charge ordering, and pressure-induced\nsuperconductivity [1,2]. They provide fascinating opportunities to study mechanism for competing orders in a\ncommon monoclinic crystal structure shown in Fig. 1 [3].\nThere are three types of one-dimensional V-O network extending along the most conducting b-axis: a zigzag chain\nformed by the V1 sites, another zigzag chain formed by\nthe V3 sites, and a two-leg ladder formed by the V2 sites.\nAt high temperatures, the A ions are distributed randomly\nover two sites with 50 % occupancy in the space group\nC2/m. They order below a certain temperature and fully\noccupy a single sites in the new space group P 21 /a. This\ndoubles the unit cell along the b-axis and generates two inequivalent sites for each of the three vanadium sites, which\nare denoted as Vna and Vnb (n=1 - 3, see Fig. 1).\nThis ordering occurs above the room temperature (RM)\nin \u03b2-Sr0.33 V2 O5 , which is a Pauli paramagnetic metal at\nRT. It undergoes a metal-insulator transition at TMIT \u223c\n170 K accompanied by a simultaneous structural transition,\nthat further triples the unit cell along the b-axis [3,4].

In this paper we report results of 51 VNMR experiments on a single crystal of \u03b2-Sr0.33 V2 O5 and\ndiscuss charge distribution and spin dynamics in the high\nT metallic phase.

Experiment\n\n119\n\n119\n\n118\nFrequency (MHz)\n\nA single crystal of \u03b2-Sr0.33 V2 O5 obtained by the\nCzochralski method was used in this work. It has the size\n0.5\u00d71.8\u00d70.2 mm3 with the largest dimension along the\nb-axis. The 51 V NMR spectra were obtained by summing\nthe Fourier transform of the spin-echo signals with the\nfrequency step of 0.3 MHz. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 was measured by the inversion recovery\nmethod. The magnetic field H0 (10.509 T) was applied in\nthe ac-plane. The direction of the field is specified by the\nangle (\u03b8) measured from the a-axis.\n\n117\n\n116\n3. Results and Discussions\nThere are four V atoms for each of the six crystalographic\nsites in a unit cell of the metallic phase (space group P 21 /a).\nWhen the magnetic field is applied in the ac-plane, these\nfour atoms become equivalent and give identical NMR spectra. Since 51 V nuclei have spin I=7/2, the electric field gradient (EFG) splits the NMR spectrum into equally spaced\nseven lines at the following frequencies due to first order\neffect of the nuclear quadrupole interaction,\n\u03bdm (\u03b8) = {1 + K(\u03b8)}\u03b3H0 + (m \u2212 1/2)\u03bdQ (\u03b8) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio (11.193 MHz/T),\nK(\u03b8) is the Knight shift, \u03bdQ (\u03b8) is the quadrupole splitting,\nand m specifies the nuclear transitions Iz = m \u2194 m \u2212 1.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 2 shows the NMR spectrum\nat \u03b8 = \u22121\u25e6 , while the lower panel displays the angle dependence of the resonance frequencies for all the lines at\nT =190 K. At each angle, there are several sets of equally\nspaced lines assigned as A - F. In many cases only a portion of the quadrupole split seven lines are clearly resolved.\nHowever, they are sufficient to determine K(\u03b8) and \u03bdQ (\u03b8)\nfrom Eq. (1). In Fig. 3(a) and (b), we plot the angle dependences of K(\u03b8) and \u03bdQ (\u03b8) for the A - F sites. Since K(\u03b8) \u226a\n1 and \u03bdQ (\u03b8) \u226a \u03b3H0 , we need consider only the lowest order\neffect for the frequency shift. Then K(\u03b8) and \u03bdQ (\u03b8) should\nobey the following angle dependences [9],\nK(\u03b8) = K1 + K2 cos2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8K )\n\u03bdQ (\u03b8) = \u03bd1 + \u03bd2 cos2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8Q ) .\n\n(2)\n\n115\n150\n\nA\nC\nE\n\n120\n\nB\nD\nF\n\n90\n\n60\n30\n\u03b8 (degree)\n\n0\n\n-30\n\nFig. 2. An example of the NMR spectrum at (upper panel) and the\nangle dependence of the NMR frequency of all the observed lines\n(lower panel) at T =190 K.\n\nThese equations indeed fit the data very well as shown by\nthe solid, dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 3(a) and (b). Thus\nwe have completely determined K(\u03b8) and \u03bd(\u03b8) for all the\nvanadium sites.\nGenerally the Knight shift at transition metal sites consists of the orbital and the spin contributions, K(\u03b8) =\nKorb (\u03b8) + Kspin (\u03b8). While Kspin may be either negative or\npositive, Korb is always positive. The fact that K(\u03b8) is negative for the entire range of angle at all sites indicates that\nthe dominant term is Kspin , which is related to the local spin\nsusceptibility as Kspin (\u03b8) = {Acp + Adip (\u03b8)}\u03c7spin . The core\npolarization coupling constant Acp is isotropic and negative, while the dipolar coupling constant Adip (\u03b8) is purely\nanisotropic, i.e. its directional average is zero. Since \u03c7spin is\nnearly isotropic except for small anisotropy of the g-value,\nthe observed angular variation of K(\u03b8) must be ascribed to\nthe anisotropy of Adip (\u03b8), which is determined by the spin\ndensity distribution of d-electrons.\n\n\f(a) 0.0\n\n(b) 0.8\n\na - axis\n\n0.6\n\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\nA\nC\nE\n\n0.4\n\nB\nD\nF\n\n1.5\nK /K(300K)\n\n\u03bdQ (MHz)\n\nK (%)\n\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1.0\nA (\u03b8 =-21o)\nC (\u03b8 =133o)\nD (\u03b8 =113o)\nD (\u03b8 =40o)\nE (\u03b8 =76o)\nF (\u03b8 =76o)\n\n0.0\n0.5\n\n-0.8\n-1.0\n150\n\n(c) 2.0\nc - axis\n\nA\nC\nE\n\nc - axis\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n30\n\u03b8 (degree)\n\n0\n\nB\nD\nF\n\n-0.2\n\na - axis\n\n-30\n\n-0.4\n150\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n30\n\u03b8 (degree)\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n0.0\n\n200\n\n240\n\n280\n\nT (K)\n\nFig. 3.

The\nshortest vanadyl bonding between the vanadium and the\napical oxygen lies nearly in the ac-plane for all the V sites\n(within 4\u25e6 ). Doublet and Lepetit investigated the local\nelectronic structure based on the extended H\u00fcckel tightbinding calculation [8]. They proposed that the magnetic\norbital accommodating the d-electrons is the dxy -orbital,\nwhere the local z-axis is parallel to the shortest V-O bonding and x and y point toward the oxygen atoms in the basal\nplane of the pyramid. The dipolar coupling Adip to the spin\ndensity on the dxy -orbital takes the largest negative value\nwhen the field is along the z-axis. Since Acp is negative,\nK(\u03b8) is expected to be most negative when the field is along\nthe shortest V-O bond direction.\nIn table 1 we compare the values of \u03c8K at which K(\u03b8)\nbecomes most negative (upper panel) with the directions\nof the shortest V-O bonding projected onto the ac-plane\nobtained from the structural data in Ref. [3] (lower part).\nWe can immediately assign the three groups of sites (A,\nB), (C, D) and (E, F) to the (V1a, V1b), (V2a, V2b) and\n(V3a, V3b) sites, respectively. We cannot determine, however, which one in each group corresponds to \"a\" or \"b\".\nWith this assignment the directions for the minimum of\nK(\u03b8) and the shortest V-O bonding agree within ten degrees, supporting that the magnetic orbital indeed has dxy\nsymmetry.\nThe data in Fig. 3(a) indicate that while K(\u03b8) for the V3a\nand V3b sites are almost identical, it differs substantially\nbetween the V2a and V2b sites and between the V1a and\nthe V1b sites.

Since the angular variation of\nAdip (\u03b8) should be similar for all the sites, the local spin\nsusceptibility \u03c7spin must be significantly different for the\nV2a and the V2b sites. Such alternation of \u03c7spin should\nbe ascribed to charge disproportionation. In other words,\nalthough the d-electron density is quite uniform in the V3\nzigzag-chains, it alternates strongly in the V2 ladders. The\nstrong charge disproportionation even in the metallic phase\nmay appear surprising. However, this has been predicted by\nDoublet and Lepetit. They argued that ordering of Sr leads\nto a large difference in the energy of the d-levels, therefore,\nthe different charge density at the V2a and the V2b sites [8].\nOn the other hand, the three groups of sites, V1, V2, and\nV3, show quite similar values of K2 when averaged over the\n\"a\" and the \"b\" sites. Thus the d-electrons are distributed\nrather uniformly over the three 1D structural units.\nThe V2a and the V2b sites exhibit also distinct T dependence of the Knight shift. Figure 3(c) show the T dependence of K for several sites normalized by the value\nat T =300 K. They were measured at \"magic angles\" at\nwhich \u03bdQ (\u03b8)=0. (No measurements were done for the B\nsites which do not have a magic angle in the ab-plane.)\nThe steep increase of |K| at the D sites with decreasing\ntemperature is in strong contrast to the nearly constant\nbehavior at the C sites. We also note peculiar decrease of\n|K| with decreasing temperature at the F sites. Although\nthe bulk susceptibility shows little T -dependence (the solid\nline), this must be a results of cancellation of opposite T dependence at the D and F sites. We should mention that\nsuch strong heterogeneity within the same structural unit\nhas not been observed in \u03b2-Na0.33 V2 O5 [10]\nThe angle dependence of \u03bdQ (\u03b8) shown in Fig. 3(b) also\nreflects the local symmetry of each V sites. There is indeed\nnoticeable correlation between the directions of shortest VO bonding and extrema of \u03bdQ (\u03b8) for many sites. However,\nEFG is rather difficult to analyze because of contributions\nnot only from the on-site d-electrons but from the neighboring ions. Hence we did not attempt to make any quantitative analysis.\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1/(T1T) (sec-1K-1)\n\nC (\u03b8 =133o )\nD (\u03b8 =113o )\n\n30\n\n80\n\nE (\u03b8 =76o )\nF (\u03b8 =76o )\n\n25\n\n60\n40\n\n20\n\n60\n\n15\n\n40\n\n10\n\n20\n0\n\nV1a or 1b\n200 240 280\n\n4\n\n150\n\n3\n100\n\nV2a & 2b\n\n20\n\n5\n0\n\n5x107\n\n(d)\n\n0\n\n200 240 280\n\nT (K)\n\nT (K)\n\n2\nV3a & 3b\n200 240 280\n\n50\n\nD site (\u03b8 =40o )\n(V2a or V2b)\n\n0\n\nT (K)\n\n200 240 280\n\n1\n\n1/(T1T K2) (sec-1K-1)\n\nA (\u03b8 =-21o )\n\n80\n\n(c)\n\n0\n\nT (K)\n\nFig. 4. T dependence of 1/T1 T at various sites measured with the field along the magic angle indicated in each panel. Also shown in (d) is\n1/(T1 T K 2 ) at the D sites.\n\nWe now discuss the spin dynamics. The nuclear relaxation rate 1/T1 was measured also with the field along\nmagic angles. This enabled site-selective measurements of\n1/T1 even when the line is not well isolated from others, due\nto strongly enhanced signal, distinct rf-pulse width for optimum excitation, and simple exponential time dependence\nof the nuclear magnetization recovery at magic angles. For\nthe E and F sites, which have nearly the same magic angle,\nthe nuclear recovery curve was fit to sum of two exponential functions. The result was checked by separate measurements on well isolated quadrupole satellite lines.\nThe T -dependences of 1/(T1 T ) are shown in Fig.4. Again\ndifferent sites show remarkably contrasting behavior. The\nV3a and V3b sites (E and F) show nearly constant behavior\nwith the similar magnitude of 1/(T1 T ), suggesting absence\nof strong spin correlations. Precisely speaking, however,\nthe E sites show slight increase of 1/(T1 T ) with decreasing\ntemperature. Such increase is more clearly visible for the\nA sites (one of the V1 sites). The results for the V2a and\nV2b (C and D) sites are most anomalous. While 1/(T1 T ) at\nthe C sites is nearly constant, it increases strongly at the D\nsites with decreasing temperature. At the D sites, 1/(T1 T )\nand K 2 follow approximately the same T -dependence as\nindicated by nearly constant 1/(T1 T K 2 ) shown in Fig. 4(d).\nGenerally for quasi 1D electron systems, spin fluctuations\nboth at q \u223c 0 and at q \u223c 2kF contribute to 1/(T1 T ),\n1/(T1 T ) = 1/(T1 T )q\u223c0 + 1/(T1 T )q\u223c2kF .\n\n(3)\n\nIn the Luttinger-liquid (LL) theories, which is expected to\nbe applicable to quasi 1D conductors, the T -dependence of\neach term is given as 1/(T1 T )q\u223c0 \u221d \u03c72spin , 1/(T1 T )q\u223c2kF \u221d\nT K\u03c1 \u22121 , where K\u03c1 =1 for non-interacting electrons but generally 0 < K\u03c1 < 1 for repulsive interactions [11,12]. The\nnearly constant behavior of 1/(T1 T K 2 ) (Fig. 4(d)) suggests\nthat the dominant contribution to 1/(T1 T ) at the D sites\ncomes from q \u223c 0 spin fluctuations. Thus our results appear to support strong ferromagnetic correlation in the V2\nladder units in the high T metallic phase. Another peculiar\nresult is the nearly constant behavior of 1/(T1 T ) at the F\nsites, in spite of the substantial decrease of the Knight shift\n\nwith decreasing temperature.\n4. Conclusion\nWe performed site-selective 51 V NMR measurements on\na single crystal of \u03b2-Sr0.33 V2 O5 in the high T metallic\nphase. We found that the magnetic properties are remarkably heterogeneous even within the same structural unit.\nIn particular, the V2 ladder unit shows strong charge disproportionation caused by the Sr ordering. At one of the\nV2 sites, the absolute value of the Knight shift and 1/(T1 T )\nincreases strongly with decreasing temperature, indicating\ndevelopment of ferromagnetic correlation. The local spin\nsusceptibility at one of the V3 sites decreases substantially\nwith decreasing temperature, although 1/(T1 T ) is nearly\nconstant.\nThis work was supported by Grant-in Aids for Scientific\nResearch (No. 18104008) from the Japan Society for the\nPromotion of Science, for Scientific Research on Priority\nAreas on \"Anomalous Quantum Materials\", and for COE\nResearch (No. 12CE2004) from the MEXT Japan.\n\nReferences\n[1] Y.
