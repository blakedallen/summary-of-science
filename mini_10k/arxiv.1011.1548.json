Introduction\nIn 2009, in inclusive e+ e\u2212 interactions, two new charmed-strange states Ds1 (2710) and\nDsJ (2860) were observed by the BaBar Collaboration in both DK and D \u2217 K channels[1]. The\navailable experimental results on these two states are as follows:\n+\nM (DsJ (2860)+ ) = 2862 \u00b1 2+5\n\u22122 MeV, \u0393(DsJ (2860) ) = 48 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 6 MeV,\n\n(1)\n\n+\n+39\nM (Ds1 (2710)+ ) = 2710 \u00b1 2+12\n\u22127 MeV, \u0393(Ds1 (2710) ) = 149 \u00b1 7\u221252 MeV,\n\n(2)\n\nB(Ds1 (2710)+ \u2192 D \u2217 K)\n= 0.91 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.12,\nB(Ds1 (2710)+ \u2192 DK)\nB(DsJ (2860)+ \u2192 D \u2217 K)\n= 1.10 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.19,\nB(DsJ (2860)+ \u2192 DK)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwith DK = D + K 0 + D 0 K + and D \u2217 K = D \u2217 + K 0 + D \u2217 0 K + . In D \u2217 K channel, the BaBar\nCollaboration also found the evidence for the DsJ (3040) whose mass and width are 3044 \u00b1 8+30\n\u22125\nMeV and 239 \u00b1 35+46\n\u221242 MeV, respectively. There is no signal of DsJ (3040) in DK channel[1].\nMore recently, in inclusive e+ e\u2212 collisions, four new charmed states D(2550), D(2600),\nD(2750), and D(2760) were found by the BaBar Collaboration[2]. The D(2550) and D(2750)\nwere observed in D \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 channel, the D(2760) was observed in D + \u03c0 \u2212 channel, and the D(2600)\nwas observed in both D \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 and D + \u03c0 \u2212 channels. The isospin partners of the D(2600)0 and\nD(2760)0 were also observed in the D 0 \u03c0 + channel. The resulting masses and widths of these\nfour states with neutral-charge are\nM (D(2550)0 ) = 2539.4 \u00b1 4.5 \u00b1 6.8 MeV, \u0393(D(2550)0 ) = 130 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 13 MeV,\n\n(5)\n\nM (D(2600)0 ) = 2608.7 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b1 2.5 MeV, \u0393(D(2600)0 ) = 93 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 13 MeV,\n\n(6)\n\nM (D(2760)0 ) = 2763.3 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b1 2.3 MeV, \u0393(D(2760)0 ) = 60.9 \u00b1 5.1 \u00b1 3.6 MeV,\n\n(7)\n\nM (D(2750)0 ) = 2752.4 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 2.7 MeV, \u0393(D(2750)0 ) = 71 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 11 MeV,\n\n(8)\n\nand the following ratios of branching fractions were also obtained :\nB(D(2600)0 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n= 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b1 0.09,\nB(D(2600)0 \u2192 D \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 )\nB(D(2760)0 \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n= 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.11.\nB(D(2750)0 \u2192 D \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nDue to the poor information on the higher excitations of D and Ds mesons, the find of these\nopen-charm states is clearly of importance to complete the D and Ds spectra. To understand\n2\n\n\ftheir observed properties, various efforts have been carried out under the assumption that all\nthe observed open-charm states are dominated by the simple q q\u0304 quark content[3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. It is natural and necessary to exhaust the possible conventional\nq q\u0304 descriptions before resorting to more exotic interpretations[18]. Further theoretical efforts are\nstill required in order to satisfactorily explain the data concerning these open-charm states. In\nthis work, we shall investigate the masses as well as strong and radiative decays of these newly\nobserved states in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and try to clarify their possible\nquarkonium assignments by comparing our predictions with the experiment.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we calculate the open-charm mesons\nmasses in a nonrelativistic constituent quark model and give the possible assignments for these\nopen-charm states based on their observed masses and decay modes. In Sec. III, we investigate,\nwith the 3 P0 decay model, the strong decays of these states for different possible assignments.\nThe radiative transitions of these states are given in Sec. IV. The summary and conclusion are\ngiven in Sec. V.\n\nII. Masses\nTo estimate the masses of c\u016b and cs\u0304 states, we employ a simple nonrelativistic constituent\nquark model which was proposed by Lakhina and Swanson and turns out to be able to describe\nthe heavy-light meson and the charmonium masses with reasonable accuracy.[19]. In this model,\nthe Hamiltonian is\nH = H0 + Hsd + Cqq\u0304 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere H0 is the zeroth-order Hamiltonian, Hsd is the spin-dependent Hamiltonian, and Cqq\u0304 is a\nconstant.

Among these newly observed opencharm states, the J P of Ds1 (2710) is determined to be 1\u2212 experimentally[27], while the spinparity quantum numbers of the other states are still unsettled.

The possible J P\nof the DsJ (2860) are 1\u2212 , 3\u2212 , * * *. Since the DsJ (2860) mass is close to 1\u2212 [Ds (1 3 D1 )] mass (2804\nMeV) and 3\u2212 [Ds (1 3 D3 )] mass (2811 MeV), the possible assignments for DsJ (2860) include\n1\u2212 [Ds (2S-1D)] and 3\u2212 [Ds (1 3 D3 )].

The DsJ (3040) mass is close to the quark model expectations for\n(\u2032)\n\n(\u2032)\n\nthe 1+ [Ds1 (1P )] mass, therefore the 1+ [Ds1 (1P )] assignment to DsJ (3040) becomes the most\npossible.\nBelow, we shall focus on these possible assignments for the observed open-charm states as\nshown in Table 4. The mass information alone is insufficient to classify these new open-charm\nstates. Their decay properties also need to be compared with model expectations. We shall\ndiscuss the decay dynamics of these states in next section.\n\nIII. Strong decays\nA. Model parameters\nIn this section, we shall employ the 3 P0 model to evaluate the tow-body open-flavor strong\ndecays of the initial state.

Some detailed reviews on the 3 P0 model can be found in Refs.[28, 29, 30, 31, 32].\nAlso, the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) approximation for spatial wave functions of mesons\nis used in the strong decays computations. This is typical of strong decay calculations. The\nSHO wave functions have the advantage that decay amplitudes and widths can be determined\nanalytically, and it has been demonstrated that the numerical results are usually not strongly\ndependent on the details of the spatial wave functions of mesons[32, 33, 34, 35]. The explicit\nexpression for the decay width employed in this work can be seen in Refs.[36].\nThe parameters involved in the 3 P0 model include the constituent quarks masses, the SHO\nwave function scale parameters \u03b2's, and the light nonstrange quark pair creation strength \u03b3.\n\u221a\nThe \u03b3 and the strange quark pair creation strength \u03b3ss\u0304 can be related by \u03b3ss\u0304 \u2248 \u03b3/ 3[37]. The\nconstituent quarks masses mu , md , ms , and mc are the same as those used in the constituent\nquark model (11). The SHO wave function scale parameters are taken to be the effective \u03b2's\nobtained by equating the root mean square radius of the SHO wave function to that obtained\nfrom the nonrelativistic quark model (11). The meson effective \u03b2's used in this work are listed\nin Table 5. The remaining parameter \u03b3 is an overall factor in the width. By fitting to 19 wellestablished experimental decay widths,3 we obtain \u03b3 = 0.452 \u00b1 0.105, consistent with 0.485 \u00b1\n0.15 obtained by Close and Swanson from their model[38].

D(2550)\nThe decay widths of D(2550) as D(2 1 S0 ) are shown in Table 6. The predicted total width\nis about 45 MeV, about 70 MeV lower than the lower limit of the measured \u0393(D(2550)) =\n130 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 13 MeV. The recent calculations in a 3 P0 model[15] and a chiral quark model[16] also\ngive a rather narrow width for the D(2 1 S0 ). The upper limit of the D(2 1 S0 )'s width is expected\nto be about 66 MeV, still about 50 MeV lower than the lower limit of the measurement. This\ninconsistency between the theoretical and experimental results could imply that the experimental\nanalysis has overestimated the width of D(2550) if this state is indeed the 2 1 S0 charmed meson,\nas suggested by Ref.[15]. Further confirmation of its resonance parameters is required to confirm\nthe D(2 1 S0 ) assignment to D(2550). The ratio \u0393(D0 (2400)\u03c0)/\u0393(D \u2217 \u03c0) is expected to be about\n0.22, which is independent of the parameter \u03b3 and can also present a consistent check for this\nassignment. Without additional information on D(2550), the D(2 1 S0 ) assignment to D(2550)\nwould remain open.\nTable 6: Decay widths of D(2550) as D(2 1 S0 ) in MeV.\nD\u2217 + \u03c0\u2212\n24.86\n\nD\u2217 0 \u03c00\n12.41\n\nD0 (2400)0 \u03c0 0\n8.09\n\nTotal\n45.35\n\nC. D(2600)\nIn the 2S-1D mixing scenario, the eigenvectors of D1 (2600) and its partner D1 (MX ) can be\nwritten as\n|D(2600)i = cos \u03b8|2 3 S1 i \u2212 sin \u03b8|1 3 D1 i,\n\n(16)\n\n|D(MX )i = sin \u03b8|2 3 S1 i + cos \u03b8|1 3 D1 i,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the \u03b8 is the D(2 3 S1 )-D(1 3 D1 ) mixing angle and MX denotes the mass of the physical\nstate D1 (MX ).\nThe predicted decay widths of D(2600) are listed in Table 7. The variations of decay widths\nand branching ratio \u0393(D + \u03c0)/\u0393(D \u2217 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) with the mixing angle \u03b8 are illustrated in Fig. 1. It is\nclear that in the presence of about 0.364 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 0.4 radians, both the total width and branching\n10\n\n\fratio \u0393(D + \u03c0)/\u0393(D \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 ) of D(2600) can be well reproduced (see Fig. 1(a)). Also in this mixing\nangle range, the D \u2217 \u03c0, D1 (2420)\u03c0, and D\u03c0 are the dominant decay modes and the mode D \u2217 + \u03c0 \u2212\ndominates D + \u03c0 \u2212 (see Fig. 1(b)), consistent with the observation. The helicity-angle distribution\nof D(2600) is also found to be consistent with the predictions for the D(2 3 S1 ) or D(1 3 D1 )[2].\nTherefore the interpretation of D(2600) as a mixture of the D(2 3 S1 ) and D(1 3 D1 ) seems convincing. It is expected that \u0393(D1 (2420)\u03c0)/\u0393(D \u2217 \u03c0) is around 1.0 and \u0393(D1 (2430)\u03c0)/\u0393(D \u2217 \u03b7) is\n1.1 \u223c 1.4. Further experimental study on the D(2600) in the D1 (2420)\u03c0, D1 (2430)\u03c0, and D \u2217 \u03b7\nchannels can present a consistent check for this interpretation.\nTable 7: Decay widths of D(2600) as the 1\u2212 state in MeV. c \u2261 cos \u03b8 and s \u2261 sin \u03b8.\nMode\nD0 \u03c00\nD+ \u03c0\u2212\nDs K\nD\u03b7\nD\u2217 0 \u03c00\nD\u2217 + \u03c0\u2212\nD\u2217 \u03b7\nDs\u2217 K\n0\nD1 (2430) \u03c0 0\n+\nD1 (2430) \u03c0 \u2212\n0 0\nD1 (2420) \u03c0\n+\nD1 (2420) \u03c0 \u2212\nD2 (2460)0 \u03c0 0\n+\nD2 (2460) \u03c0 \u2212\n\n\u0393i\n0.02c + 1.28cs + 25.90s2\n0.02c2 + 1.77cs + 51.89s2\n0.32c2 \u2212 3.17cs + 7.86s2\n0.50c2 \u2212 4.70cs + 10.99s2\n3.62c2 + 13.42cs + 12.45s2\n7.44c2 + 27.16cs + 24.79s2\n1.30c2 + 2.80cs + 1.51s2\n0.01c2 + 0.03cs + 0.02s2\n5.38c2 \u2212 14.36cs + 9.58s2\n10.39c2 \u2212 27.76cs + 18.55s2\n2.51c2 + 14.87cs + 22.41s2\n4.78c2 + 28.47cs + 42.96s2\n(0.79c2 + 0.98cs + 0.31s2 ) \u00d7 10\u22123\n(0.73c2 + 0.90cs + 0.28s2 ) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\u0393t = 36.28c2 + 39.82cs + 228.90s2\n2\n\n200\nHaL\n\n80\nPartial width HMeVL\n\n175\n150\n125\n\nGtotal z\n\n100\n75\n50\n25\n\n102  \u0301GD+ \u03a0- \u0090GD*+ \u03a0- \u00ae\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n0.5\n\u0398 HRadiansL\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nHbL\nD\u03a0\nD'1 \u03a0\n\n60\n\nD* \u03a0\n\n40\n\nD1 \u03a0\n20\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n\u0398 HRadiansL\n\n1\n\nD\u0397\nDs K\nD* \u0397\n1.5\n\nFigure 1: Decay widths and branching ratio \u0393(D+ \u03c0)/\u0393(D\u2217 + \u03c0\u2212 ) of D(2600) versus \u03b8.

At around 2760 MeV, the lower limit of the\nD(MX )'s total width is expected to be about 140 \u223c 144 MeV. Clearly, both the predicted total\nwidth and \u0393(D + \u03c0)/\u0393(D \u2217 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) of the D(MX ) are in disagreement with the data concerning\nthe D(2750) or D(2760), which makes the D(2600)'s partner assignment for the D(2750) or\nD(2760) unlikely. This conclusion has been reached by Zhong in a chiral quark model[16]. We\nshall discuss other possible assignments for the D(2750) and D(2760) in the next subsection.\n\nD. D(2750) and D(2760)\nSince the 1\u2212 assignment for the D(2750) or D(2760) seems unlikely as mentioned above,\nas shown in Table 4, the remaining possible assignments of D(2760) include the D(2 3 P0 ) and\nD(1 3 D3 ), and the possible assignments of D(2750) are the D(1 3 D3 ), D2 (1D), and D2\u2032 (1D).\nThe decay widths of D(2760) as D(2 3 P0 ) or D(1 3 D3 ) are listed in Table 8. The width\nof D(1 3 D3 ) is predicted to be about 73 MeV, compatible with the measured \u0393(D(2760)) =\n60.9 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b1 3.1 MeV. The study in a chiral quark model also leads to a similar result (\u223c 68\n12\n\n\fMeV)[16]. The D(1 3 D3 ) interpretation for the D(2760) therefore appears suitable. The width\nof D(2 3 P0 ) is predicted to be about 135 MeV, about 70 MeV higher than 60.9 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b1 3.1 MeV.\nHowever, the lower limit of the D(2 3 P0 )'s total width is expected to be bout 72 MeV, compatible\nwith the measurement, which makes the D(2 3 P0 ) assignments for the D(2750) also plausible.\nTable 8: Decay widths of D(2760) as D(2 3 P0 ) or D(1 3 D3 ) in MeV.

The\nexpressions of decay widths of D2 (1D) are not listed but the same as those of D2\u2032 (1D) except that\n\u2032\nc\u016b\n\u2032\nthe \u03c6c\u016b\n1D is replaced by \u03c61D + \u03c0/2. The dependence of the total widths of D2 (1D) and D2 (1D)\n3\non the mixing angle \u03c6c\u016b\n1D is illustrated in Fig. 3. The total width of D(1 D3 ) is predicted to\n\nbe about 67 MeV, consistent with the measured \u0393(D(2750)) = 71 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 11 MeV, which makes\nthe D(1 3 D3 ) assignment for the D(2750) reasonable. The D2 (1D) is expected to be broader\nthan the D1\u2032 (2D). The similar behavior exists in the [D1 (1P ), D1\u2032 (1P )]=[D1 (2430), D1 (2420)]\nsystem where the D1 (1P ) is broader than the D1\u2032 (1P ). From Fig. 3, one can see that, at 0.697\nradians, the lower limit of the D2 (1D)'s total width is substantially larger than the upper limit\n\n13\n\n\fof the measurement, while the lower limit of the D2\u2032 (1D)'s total width is close to the upper limit\nof the experiment.

It is expected\nthat \u0393(D\u03c1)/\u0393(D \u2217 \u03c0) for the D(1 3 D3 ) and D2\u2032 (1D) are about 1.8 and 0.07, respectively. Further\nexperimental information on these two states in D \u2217 \u03c0, D\u03c9, and D\u03c1 channels can further test the\npresent assignments for D(2760) and D(2750).\nTable 10:\n\n\u0393(D(2760)\u2192D+ \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\u0393(D(2750)\u2192D\u2217 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\nfor possible combinations.\n\n[D(2760), D(2750)]\n\n\u0393(D(2760)\u2192D+ \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\u0393(D(2750)\u2192D\u2217 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\n[D(2 3 P0 ), D(1 3 D3 )]\n[D(2 3 P0 ), D2\u2032 (1D)]\n[D(1 3 D3 ), D(1 3 D3 )]\n[D(1 3 D3 ), D2\u2032 (1D)]\n\n2.16\n1.18\n1.11\n0.60\n\nThe D(2750) signal observed in D \u2217 \u03c0 is very similar to the D(2760) signal observed in D\u03c0,\ntheir mass and width values differ by 2.6\u03c3 and 1.5\u03c3[2]. Therefore, it is likely that the D(2760)\nand D(2750) refer to the same resonance. If so, since the 1\u2212 interpretation for the D(2760) or\nD(2750) can be excluded as discussed previously, the only one possible quarkonium assignment\nwould be that they are the same D(1 3 D3 ), although the ratio of \u0393(D + \u03c0 \u2212 )/\u0393(D \u2217 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is somewhat larger than the measured 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.11.4 Clearly, the further search of the D(2750)\nin the D\u03c0, Ds K, D\u03b7, and D0 (2400)\u03c0 channels is crucial to discriminate the 2\u2212 and 3\u2212 assignments for the D(2750) because a 3\u2212 cn\u0304 state is forbidden to decay into D0 (2400)\u03c0 while a 2\u2212 cn\u0304\nstate is forbidden to decay into D\u03c0, Ds K, and D\u03b7. Also, the \u0393(D\u03c1)/\u0393(D \u2217 \u03c0) for the D2\u2032 (1D) is\n4\n\nUnder the D(1 3 D3 ) assignment, this ratio is expected to be about 1.0 at the initial state mass of (2763.3 +\n2752.4)/2 MeV. The similar result of about 0.9 is also obtained in a 3 P0 model[15]. The predictions from the\nchiral quark model[16] and the heavy quark effective theory[17] are 1.58 and 1.94, respectively.\n\n15\n\n\fremarkably different from that for the D(1 3 D3 ), therefore the experimental information on the\nD(2750) in the D\u03c1 and D\u03c9 is also important to differentiate these two possible interpretations\nfor the D(2750).\nIn summary, if the D(2750) and D(2760) are confirmed to be the same resonance, they\nwould be the D(1 3 D3 ); otherwise, the favorable interpretation would be that the D(2750) and\nD(2760) are the D2\u2032 (1D) and D(1 3 D3 ), respectively. To distinguish these two possibilities,\nfurther experimental studies on these two states are needed. Below we turn to the charmedstrange states.\n\nE. Ds1 (2710) and DsJ (2860)\nIn the 2S-1D mixing scenario, the eigenvectors of Ds1 (2710) and its partner Ds1 (MY ) can\nbe written as\n|Ds1 (2710)i = cos \u03b81 |2 3 S1 i \u2212 sin \u03b81 |1 3 D1 i,\n\n(18)\n\n|Ds1 (MY )i = sin \u03b81 |2 3 S1 i + cos \u03b81 |1 3 D1 i,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the \u03b81 is the Ds (2 3 S1 )-Ds (1 3 D1 ) mixing angle and MY denotes the mass of the physical\nstate Ds1 (MY ).\nThe decay widths of Ds1 (2710) are listed in Table 11. The variations of decay widths and\n\u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) with the mixing angle \u03b81 are illustrated in Fig. 4. Clearly, with 1.06 \u2264 \u03b81 \u2264\n1.34 radians, both the total width and \u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) of Ds1 (2710) can be well reproduced\n(see Fig. 4 (a)). Also, in this mixing angle range, the main decay modes are DK and D \u2217 K (see\nFig. 4 (b)), in accord with the observation of the Ds1 (2710) in the DK and D \u2217 K. Therefore, the\npicture of Ds1 (2710) being in fact a mixture of the Ds (2 3 S1 ) and Ds (1 3 D1 ) seems convincing.\nThe studies in a chiral quark model[13] and a 3 P0 model[14] also favor this interpretation. Future\nexperimental information on the Ds1 (2710) in the remaining channels Ds \u03b7 and Ds\u2217 \u03b7 can provide\na consistent check for this assignment.\n2\n2\n2\nAccording to MY2 = MD\n+ MD\n\u2212 MD\n, the D(MY ) is expected to have a\n3\n3\ns (2 S1 )\ns (1 D1 )\ns1 (2710)\n\nmass of about 2.81 GeV. Other approaches predicted MY \u2243 2.8 \u223c 2.9 GeV (see Table 2).

The MY is restricted to be\n2800 \u223c 2900 MeV and the \u03b81 is restricted to be 1.06 \u223c 1.34 radians. With the variations of the\ninitial state mass and the mixing angle, the total width of Ds1 (MY ) varies from about 40 to 70\nMeV and the \u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) varies from about 0.04 to 2.71.\nBoth the predicted mass and width of Ds1 (MY ) are consistent with those of DsJ (2860).\nTherefore, if DsJ (2860) is a 1\u2212 state, it would be a natural candidate for the Ds1 (MY ). Under\nthis picture, the numerical results for the decays widths of DsJ (2860) are listed in Table 11,\nand the dependence of the total width as well as \u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) on the mixing angle \u03b81 is\nillustrated in Figs.4. It is clear that both the total width and \u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) of DsJ (2860) can\nbe well reproduced with 1.29 \u2264 \u03b81 \u2264 1.33 radians, just lying on the range of 1.06 \u2264 \u03b81 \u2264 1.34\nradians (see 4(c)). Also, in this mixing angle range, the main decay modes are DK \u2217 , D \u2217 K\nand DK, consistent with the observation of the DsJ (2860) in DK and D \u2217 K. Therefore, the\nidentification of DsJ (2860) as the partner of Ds1 (2710) appears convincing. The study in a 3 P0\nmodel[14] also favors this assignment.\nThe DsJ (2860) could also be the Ds (1 3 D3 ) as shown in Table 4. In this case, the decay widths\nare listed in Table 12. It is expected that \u0393 \u2243 77 MeV and branching ratio \u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) \u2243\n0.8. The predicted \u0393(D \u2217 K)/\u0393(DK) \u2243 0.8 is consistent with the measurement.

The dependence, of the total width of DsJ (3040) as 1 state,\n\non the mixing angle \u03c6cs\u0304\n2P and \u03b2A are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.\n\u2032\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, at \u03c6cs\u0304\n2P = 0.564 radians, the predicted \u0393(Ds1 (2P )) and \u0393(Ds1 (2P ))\n\nare close to the upper and lower limits of the experimental data of 239\u00b135+46\n\u221242 MeV, respectively.\nThe similar behavior also exists at about \u03b2A = 306 MeV, as shown in Fig. 7. Within the\n\u2032 (2P )\ntheoretical and experimental errors, the predicted total widths for both Ds1 (2P ) and Ds1\n\u2032 (2P ) assignments\nare comparable with the experiment. Therefore, both the Ds1 (2P ) and Ds1\n\nfor the DsJ (3040) seem likely based on its measured total width. It should be noted that since\nthe experimental errors of \u0393(DsJ (3040) is large, the improved measurement of \u0393(DsJ (3040) is\nneeded to confirm our present assignment.\nAlso, Fig. 7 indicates that in the vicinity of initial state \u03b2 = 300 (270 \u2264 \u03b2A \u2264 330 MeV),\n\u2032 (2P ) in width, which\nthe Ds1 (2P ) is expected to be about 100 \u223c 150 MeV broader than the Ds1\n\nis consistent with the prediction from the heavy quark effective theory. In the framework of the\nheavy quark effective theory, the Ds1 (2P ) is the 1+ state existing in S = (0+ , 1+ ) doublet while\n\u2032 (2P ) corresponds to the 1+ state of T = (1+ , 2+ ) doublet, and the 1+ state of S doublet\nDs1\n\nis predicted to be broader than the one of T doublet[12, 39]. The similar conclusion has been\nreached in calculations from the 3 P0 model[12] and the chiral quark model[13].\nFor the Ds1 (2P ), the main decay modes are D2 (2460)K, D \u2217 K, D \u2217 K \u2217 , DK \u2217 , and D0 (2400)K,\n\u2032 (2P ) they are D \u2217 K \u2217 , DK \u2217 , D \u2217 K, D (2400)K, D (2420)K, and D (2460)K.\nwhile for the Ds1\n0\n1\n2\n\nThe branching ratios \u0393(D \u2217 K \u2217 )/\u0393(D \u2217 K), \u0393(DK \u2217 )/\u0393(D \u2217 K) and \u0393(D2 (2460)K)/\u0393(D \u2217 K) are\n\n19\n\n\fexpected to be respectively about 0.9, 0.8, and 1.1 for the Ds1 (2P ), while about 5.0, 2.0, and\n\u2032 (2P ). The decay patterns for these two assignments are different. The additional\n0.4 for the Ds1\n\nexperimental information on the branching ratios of DsJ (3040) are important to discriminate\nthese two possibilities.\n\u2032\ncs\u0304\nTable 13: Decay widths of DsJ (3040) as the Ds1 (2P ) or Ds1\n(2P ) in MeV. c3 \u2261 cos \u03c6cs\u0304\n2P , s3 \u2261 sin \u03c62P .\n\ncs\u0304\nEstimates of decay widths containing \u03c6cs\u0304\n2P are given in terms of \u03c62P = 0.564 radians.\n\nMode\nD0 K \u2217 +\nD+ K \u22170\nDs \u03c6\nD\u2217 0 K +\nD\u2217 + K 0\nDs\u2217 \u03b7\nD\u2217 0 K \u2217 +\nD\u2217 + K \u2217 0\nD1 (2430)0 K +\nD1 (2430)+K 0\nD1 (2420)0 K +\nD1 (2420)+K 0\nD2 (2460)0 K +\nD2 (2460)+K 0\nD0 (2400)0 K +\nD0 (2400)+K 0\nDs1 (2460)\u03b7\nDs0 (2317)\u03b7\n\nDs1 (2P )\n\u0393i\n2\n25.33c3 + 18.27c3s3 + 19.25s23 = 31.85\n24.51c23 + 16.28c3s3 + 19.08s23 = 30.31\n0.45c23 \u2212 0.05c3s3 + 0.34s23 = 0.39\n14.92c23 + 35.09c3s3 + 27.42s23 = 34.35\n14.91c23 + 36.01c3s3 + 27.72s23 = 34.84\n2.39c23 + 6.84c3s3 + 4.90s23 = 6.20\n31.08c23 + 44.35s23 = 34.59\n28.83c23 + 40.77s23 = 32.24\n0.01c23 \u2212 0.21c3s3 + 2.08s23 = 0.50\n0.01c23 \u2212 0.21c3s3 + 1.99s23 = 0.48\n0.01c23 \u2212 0.37c3s3 + 6.74s23 = 1.76\n0.01c23 \u2212 0.38c3s3 + 6.77s23 = 1.77\n21.22c23 + 40.71c3s3 + 21.47s23 = 39.68\n20.79c23 + 40.05c3s3 + 21.07s23 = 38.97\n25.92c23 + 1.23c3s3 + 0.01s23 = 19.07\n20.81c23 \u2212 1.05c3s3 + 0.01s23 = 14.39\n(0.05c23 \u2212 1.54c3 s3 + 12.89s23 ) \u00d7 10\u22122 = 0.03\n(431.34c23 + 8.87c3 s3 + 0.05s23) \u00d7 10\u22122 = 3.12\n\u0393t = 235.50c23 + 192.29c3s3 + 243.11s23 = 324.55\n\n\u2032\nDs1\n(2P )\n\u0393i\n12.74\n13.27\n0.40\n7.99\n7.79\n1.10\n39.84\n37.36\n1.59\n1.52\n4.99\n5.01\n3.00\n2.89\n6.86\n6.43\n0.10\n1.19\n\u0393t = 154.06\n\nIV.

According to the PDG[26], the well established D and Ds states include the D, Ds , D \u2217 , Ds\u2217 , D0 (2400), Ds0 (2317), D1 (2430), D1 (2420),\nDs1 (2460), Ds1 (2536), D2 (2460), and Ds2 (2573). Therefore, we only consider the processes\n21\n\n\fwhere the final states contain the ground S and P -wave open-charm mesons. The resulting E1\ntransitions widths of these open-charm states for the favorable assignments mentioned in above\nsections together with the photon energies are given in Tables 14-17. The M 1 transitions widths\nare given in Table 18.\nAs can be seen in Table 15, the D1 (2420)\u03b3 and D1 (2430)\u03b3 are clearly of great interest to\ndiscriminate the 2\u2212 and 3\u2212 interpretations for the D(2750), since these modes are forbidden for\na 3\u2212 state while allowable for a 2\u2212 state. Especially, the \u0393(D2\u2032 (1D) \u2192 D1 (2420)\u03b3) is expected\nto be about 757 keV and thus becomes an experimentally promising process.\nSimilarly, from Table 16, the experimental information on the DsJ (2860) in the Ds0 (2317)\u03b3,\nDs1 (2459)\u03b3, and Ds1 (2535)\u03b3 would be important to discriminate the 1\u2212 and 3\u2212 interpretations\nsince these decay modes are forbidden for the 3\u2212 state while allowable for the 1\u2212 state.\nAs for the M 1 transitions, experimental study on the ratio R =\n\nB(DsJ (3040)\u2192Ds1 (2460))\nB(DsJ (3040)\u2192Ds1 (2535))\n\nwould\n\n\u2032 (2P ) interpretations since it is expected that\nbe useful to discriminate the Ds1 (2P ) and Ds1\n\u2032 (2P )) \u2248 1.3.\nR(Ds1 (2P )) \u2248 11.7 while R(Ds1\n\nTable 14: E1 transitions widths of D(2550) and D(2600).

Summary and conclusion\nThe discovery of D(2550), D(2600), D(2750), D(2760), Ds1 (2710), DsJ (2860), and DsJ (3040)\nprovides a good opportunity to test our present understanding of charmed mesons and is also of\nimportance to further establish the D and Ds spectra. We are trying to shed some light on the\nnatures of these open-charm states by investigating their masses and decays in the nonrelativistic\nconstituent quark model.\nWe first calculated the charmed meson spectrum in the nonrelativistic constituent quark\nmodel. The overall agreement between our predicted masses and those from other approaches\nsuch as the Blankenbecler-Sugar equation and the relativistic quark models turns out to be\nsatisfactory. According to the observed decay modes and by comparing the measured masses\nwith our predictions, we presented the possible assignments of these newly observed open-charm\nstates.\nMass spectra alone are insufficient to determine the quantum numbers of these open-charm\n23\n\n\fTable 18: M 1 transitions widths.

We therefore further evaluated\nthe strong and E1 and M 1 radiative decays of these open-charm states for possible assignments.\nComparing our predictions with the experiment, we conclude that (1) if the D(2550) is\nindeed the D(2 1 S0 ) state, its width could be overestimated experimentally; (2) the D(2600)\nand Ds1 (2710) can be identified as the 2 3 S1 -1 3 D1 mixtures; (3) if the D(2750) and D(2760) are\nthe same state, they could be interpreted as the D(1 3 D3 ); otherwise, they could be assigned\nas the D(1 3 D3 ) and D2\u2032 (1D), respectively; (4) both the Ds (1 3 D3 ) and Ds1 (2710)'s partner\n\u2032 (2P ) interpretations\nassignments for the DsJ (2860) are likely; and (5) both the Ds1 (2P ) and Ds1\n\nfor the DsJ (3040) seem possible. Further experimental studies on these states are needed.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge Prof. Xiang Liu for very helpful suggestions and discussions.
