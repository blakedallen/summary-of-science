Metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) can provide a probe of the earliest epoch of star formation in the Universe, being\nthe oldest stellar systems observable. In addition, young and intermediate-age low-metallicity GCs are present in external\ngalaxies. Nevertheless, inferring their evolutionary status by using integrated properties may suffer from large intrinsic\nuncertainty caused by the discrete nature of stars in stellar systems, especially in the case of faint objects.\nAims. In this paper, we evaluate the intrinsic uncertainty (due to statistical effects) affecting the integrated colours and\nmass\u2013to\u2013light ratios as a function of the cluster integrated visual magnitude (MVtot ), which represents a quantity directly\nmeasured. We investigate the case of metal-poor single-burst stellar populations with age from a few million years to a likely\nupper value for the Galactic globular cluster ages (\u223c15 Gyr).\nMethods. Our approach is based on Monte Carlo techniques for randomly generating stars distributed according to the cluster's\nmass function.\nResults. Integrated colours and mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios in different photometric bands are checked to be in good agreement with\nthe observational values of low-metallicity Galactic clusters; the effect of different assumptions on the Horizontal Branch (HB)\nmorphology is shown to be not relevant, at least for the photometric bands explored here. We present integrated colours and\nmass\u2013to\u2013light ratios as a function of age for different assumptions on the cluster total V magnitude. We find that the intrinsic\nuncertainty cannot be neglected. In particular, in models with MVtot = \u22124 the broad-band colours show an intrinsic uncertainty\nso high as to prevent precise age evaluation of the cluster. The effects of different assumptions on the initial mass function\nand on the minimum mass for which carbon burning is ignited on both integrated colours and mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios are also\nanalyzed. Finally, the present predictions are compared with recent results available in the literature, showing in some cases\nnon-negligible differences.\n\nKey words. stars: evolution \u2013 (Galaxy:) globular clusters: general \u2013 galaxies: star clusters\n\n1. Introduction\nA key issue in astronomy is to determine ages and chemical compositions of those stars and stellar systems that\nare needed to reconstruct the formation and evolution\nof galaxies.

Hereinafter we will\nuse the term \"globular clusters\" (GCs) to signify massive\nclusters of whatever age and chemical composition.\nGCs have the advantage to be bright objects, and\nthen to be easily observed beyond the Local Group.\nIn addition, they are thought to be simple stellar pop-\n\n\f2\n\nFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\nulations (SSPs), consisting of a gravitationally bound\ngroup of stars born at nearly the same moment, and\nwith a nearly identical chemical composition. The integrated broad-band colours, line indices, and mass-tolight ratios, we observe from those systems, are the\nunique observational tools to understand their properties. Since the pioneering work by Tinsley (1972), different\ngroups have developed population synthesis models, e.g.\n(Brocato et al. 1990b; Charlot & Bruzual 1991; Buzzoni\n1993; Bressan et al. 1994; Worthey 1994; Maraston 1998;\nKurth et al. 1999; Brocato et al. 2000; Vazdekis 1999;\nGirardi et al. 2000; Anders & Fritze-v.Alvensleben 2003;\nBruzual & Charlot 2003; Maraston 2005, and references\ntherein) in order to interpret such observables.\nBesides the systematic uncertainties due to different\nsets of stellar evolutionary tracks and different spectral\nlibraries\u2013used to transform the models from luminosity\nand effective temperature to observable quantities\u2013 (see\ne.g. Charlot et al. 1996; Maraston 1998; Brocato et al.\n2000; Bruzual & Charlot 2003; Yi 2003), broad-band\ncolours may suffer from large intrinsic fluctuations caused\nby the discrete nature of the number of stars in the system. The first studies were carried out in the optical by\nBarbaro & Bertelli (1977) - for population I clusters - and\nChiosi et al. (1988)- for intermediate (Z=0.001) and solar metallicity -, while Santos & Frogel (1997) analyzed\nthe case for near infrared (NIR) bands. Among other results, the quoted authors concluded that it is necessary to\ninclude stochastic effects when deriving ages and metallicities from integrated broad\u2013band colours.\nMost studies normalized their theoretical predictions\nto the total number of stars or total mass in the cluster, while Brocato et al. (1999, 2000) derived the mean\nbroad-band colours and the corresponding dispersions as\na function of the cluster visual magnitude (MVtot ) for selected values of ages. This approach directly links theory\nand observations and it is crucial when the cluster age\nand metallicity are inferred from the observed broad\u2013band\ncolours, especially for clusters at the faint end of the GC\nluminosity function.\nIn this paper we extend the investigations by\nBrocato et al. (1999) and Brocato et al. (2000) and we analyze stochastic effects not only on broad\u2013band colours,\nbut also on mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios as a function of the\nadopted cluster visual magnitude, MVtot . We provide a\ncomprehensive study on this problem by investigating the\ntime\u2013evolution of both integrated colours and mass\u2013to\u2013\nlight ratios for a fine grid of stellar ages and for three\ndifferent values for MVtot . The analysis is carried out using\nnew single-burst low-metallicity models (Z=0.0002) based\non the updated stellar models database by Cariulo et al.\n(2004). We choose this metallicity because the metal\u2013poor\nGCs can provide a probe of the earliest epoch of star formation in the Universe, being the oldest stellar systems\nobservable. In addition, young and intermediate age low\nmetallicity GCs are present in external galaxies (Larsen &\nRichtler 1999, 2000). For these reasons, and also because\nan analysis of young metal\u2013poor clusters gives an idea on\n\nhow old GCs appeared when they formed, we explore a\nwide range of ages (7.7 \u2264 log[age(yr)] \u2264 10.3). We note\nthat we did not take into account redshift effects thus our\ncalculations can be used only for objects with a redshift\nlower than about 0.1.\nThe results are compared with a sample of lowmetallicity clusters in the Galaxy with different HB morphology, chosen as prototypes of the old stellar populations studied in this work. The present theoretical predictions are also compared with recent results available in the\nliterature showing in some cases non-negligible differences.\nWe also discuss the influence of the adopted Initial\nMass Function (IMF) on integrated colours and mass\u2013to\u2013\nlight ratios and the effect of changing the maximum mass\n(Mup ) for which carbon burning is not ignited, due to effects of the degenerate pressure and neutrino energy losses\nin the core. The assumption of a fixed MVtot can lead to\na peculiar behaviour when varying the shape of the IMF,\nsince an adjustment of the total number of stars might be\nrequired to keep the MVtot value fixed.\nThe layout of the paper is the following. In Section 2\nthe ingredients of the stellar population synthesis code are\noutlined, together with a brief description of the method\nadopted to derive the integrated quantities. In Section 3\nwe show the comparison of the theoretical results with\nselected observations of galactic globular clusters. Then,\nwe discuss the uncertainties affecting integrated colours\n(Section 4) and mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios (Section 5), together\nwith a comparison with previous works.\n\n2. Description of the code\nSynthetic CMDs and magnitudes presented in this paper\nare based on the stellar population synthesis code developed by Brocato et al. (1999, 2000), and Raimondo et al.\n(2005)1 . In this section, we briefly describe the main ingredients and recall the method used to derive integrated\nmagnitudes and colours, referring to the cited papers for\nmore details.\n\n2.1. Ingredients\nThe present SSP models rely on the evolutionary tracks of\nthe \"Pisa Evolutionary library\"2 for masses M \u2265 0.6M\u2299\n(Cariulo et al. 2004). The input physics adopted in the\nmodels has already been discussed in Cariulo et al. (2004).\nWe only point out here that the models take into account atomic diffusion, including the effects of gravitational settling, and thermal diffusion with diffusion coefficients given by Thoul et al. (1994); radiative acceleration\n(see e.g. Richer et al. 1998; Richard et al. 2002) is not included. The effects of rotation (see e.g. Maeder & Zahn\n1998; Palacios et al. 2003) are also not included.\n1\n\nhttp://www.oa-teramo.inaf.it/SPoT\nhttp://astro.df.unipi.it/SAA/PEL/Z0.html. Data files are\nalso available at the CDS.\n2\n\n\fFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\nConvective\nregions,\nidentified\nfollowing\nthe\nSchwarzschild criterion, are treated with the mixing\nlength formalism. We use throughout the canonical\nassumption of inefficient overshooting, so the He burning\nstructures are calculated according to the prescriptions\nof canonical semiconvection induced by the penetration of convective elements in the radiative region\n(Castellani et al. 1985). The efficiency and presence of a\nmild overshooting are still open questions (Barmina et al.\n2002; Brocato et al. 2003); however, as discussed in Yi\n(2003), a modest amount of overshooting (i.e. HP \u223c 0.2,\nsee also Brocato et al. 2003) influences only integrated\ncolours with ages <\n\u223c 1.5 Gyr for a maximum amount\nof \u22480.1 mag. The models span the evolutionary phases\nfrom the main sequence up to C ignition or the onset of\nthermal pulses (TP) in the advanced Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (AGB) in the mass range 0.6 \u00f7 11 M\u2299. This allows\nus to calculate stellar population models in the age range\n\u2248 50 Myr \u00f7 20 Gyr.\nBeyond the early\u2013AGB phase, thermally pulsating\n(TP) stars have been simulated in the synthesis code using the analytic formulas of Wagenhuber & Groenewegen\n(1998) which describes time evolution of the core mass,\nand luminosity of TP stars. These formulae include three\nimportant effects: (i) the fact that the first pulses do\nnot reach the full amplitude, (ii) the hot bottom burning process that occurs in massive stars, and (iii) the\nthird dredge\u2013up. The effective temperature (Te ) of each\nTP\u2013AGB star has been evaluated using prescriptions by\nRenzini & Voli (1981), considering the appropriate slope\nd log(L/L\u2299 )/d log(Te ) of the adopted evolutionary tracks.\nThe analytic procedure ends up providing the time evolution of the temperature and luminosity for a given mass\n(see for details Raimondo et al. 2005).\nMass loss affecting Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars and\nearly\u2013AGB stars has been taken into account following\nprescriptions by Reimers (1975):\n\u1e40R = \u22124 * 10\u221213 \u03b7R * LR/M,\nwhile during the TP phase we\nBaud & Habing (1983) mass\u2013loss rate:\n\u1e40BH = \u03bcLR/Me .\n\n(1)\nadopted\n\nthe\n(2)\n\nHere, L, R, M, Me are, respectively, the star luminosity,\nradius, total mass, and envelope mass in solar units;\n\u03bc = \u22124 * 10\u221213 (Me,0 /M ), being Me,0 the envelope mass\nat the first TP. Eq. 2 is a modification of the Reimers\nformula with \u03b7R = 1 which also includes a dependence\non the actual mass envelope. The initial-final mass relation is applied by Dominguez et al. (1999), and no white\ndwarfs (WD) more massive than 1.1 M\u2299 are accepted\n(Prada Moroni & Straniero 2005).\nIn this paper the TP phase is included but we do not\nadopt any separation between C-rich and O-rich TP-stars.\nAll stars are oxygen-rich when they enter the AGB phase.\nWhether or not they become C-stars depends primarily\non the efficiency of the third dredge-up (TDU) occurring\n\n3\n\non the TP-AGB phase, and the extent and time-variation\nof the mass-loss (e.g. Marigo et al. 1999; Straniero et al.\n2003). In low-metallicity stars (Z < 0.004), the amount\nof oxygen in the envelope is so low that a few thermal\npulses are sufficient to convert an O-rich star into a C-star\n(Renzini & Voli 1981). In addition, the smaller the metallicity the smaller the minimum mass for the onset of TDU\n(e.g. Straniero et al. 2003). On the other hand, TP-AGB\nstars may experience episode of strong mass loss, that in\nthe case of low mass stars may cause a reduction of the\nenvelope mass that may delay or even prevent the TDU occurrence and the formation of C-rich stars (Marigo et al.\n1999). In conclusion, the presence of C-rich stars may affect NIR-bands luminosity and its uncertainty in the case\nof low-metallicity, intermediate-age massive clusters (see\ne.g. Maraston 1998), while at the typical age of Galactic\nglobular clusters their presence become more uncertain,\nas confirmed by the fact that AGB stars in GGC are all\nobserved to be oxygen-rich, so that carbon does not appear to have been dredge-up into the envelops during thermal pulses (Lattanzio & Wood 2003). In addition, our\nassumption is also expected to have marginal effect on\nintegrated quantities of faint populations, as bright TPAGB stars are statistically less frequent, or even absent.\nFinally, it will be shown that the details and the treatment of the physical processes at work on the TP-AGB\nphase, as well as their impact on synthetic colours, is still\nuncertain (Section 4).\nThe adopted colour transformations for the standard\nU BV RIJHK bands are from Castelli (1999), see also\nCastelli et al. (1997). To calculate integrated colours in\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) bands (WFPC2 and\nNICMOS systems) we adopted the colour transformations\nby Origlia & Leitherer (2000) based on the Bessell et al.\n(1998) stellar atmospheric models.\nAs well known the mixing length parameter (\u03b1) governs the efficiency of convection in the convective envelope\nof a stellar structure. The \u03b1 parameter used for calculating the evolutionary tracks adopted in the present work\nhas been calibrated in such a way that the isochrones reproduce, with the adopted colour transformations, the observed RG branch colour of GCs with the proper metallicity and age. This is evident from Fig. 2 in which our\nsynthetic models nicely reproduce the RGB colours of the\nselected GCs. The \u03b1 parameter needed in the present evolutionary models to obtain this agreement is \u03b1 \u22482.0, but\nit's worth noticing that \u03b1 is a free parameter, sensitively\ndependent on the chosen color transformations and on\nall the adopted physical inputs which affects the effective\ntemperature of a model. Cariulo et al. (2004) showed that\ntracks with the same physical assumptions for metallicity\nup to Z\u22480.001 reproduces the RGB colours of galactic\nGCs for the same \u03b1 values, while metal-rich (Z>0.001)\nand standard solar models require an \u03b1 slightly lower (see\nCiacio et al. 1997; Castellani et al. 2003).\nThe very low mass tracks (VLM, M \u2264 0.6 M\u2299) are\ntaken from Baraffe et al. (1997). The tracks have been\nalready transformed by the authors to the observational\n\n\f4\n\nFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\nplane in the Johnson-Cousins system adopting the colour\ntransformations by Allard et al. (1997), particularly suitable for low mass stars. We checked that low mass models satisfactory match, in all the available colours, the\nhigher mass models (Fagiolini 2004). However, as already\ndiscussed by e.g. Brocato et al. (2000), VLM stars do\nnot contribute to the photometric indices, although their\ncontribution to the cluster mass is fundamental. Masses\nlower than the minimum mass for the central H ignition\n\u2248 0.08 M\u2299, (see e.g. Baraffe et al. 1997) have been estimated do not significantly contribute to the total mass\nof the cluster (see e.g. Chabrier & Mera 1997), and thus\nthey are not taken into account.\nPost\u2013AGB evolution, until the entrance in the white\ndwarfs (WD) cooling sequence, are not considered because the evolutionary time is too short to have a significant influence (see e.g Blocker et al. 1997). WDs have\nbeen included in the code using evolutionary models\nby Salaris et al. (2000). They have been transformed by\nadopting the atmospheric models by Saumon & Jacobson\n(1999) for DA WDs, which include the treatment of the\ncollision-induced absorption of H2 molecules, for T <\n4000 K. For higher temperatures the transformations of\nBergeron et al. (1995) have been used. As we will discuss in the following our standard model adopts 6.5 M\u2299\nas Mup , (Dominguez et al. 1999). As expected, and as already noted by e.g. Angeletti et al. (1980), the contribution of the WD population to optical and NIR photometric\nindices is negligible although they significantly contribute\nto the total mass of the cluster.\nThe IMF of Kroupa (2002) is adopted in the mass interval 0.1 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 11, unless explicitly stated otherwise. To simulate the mass distribution of stars in the\nsynthetic CMD we use a Monte Carlo method: the position\nof each randomly created star in the log L/L\u2299 vs. log Te\ndiagram is determined for each given age. As already discussed, the chemical composition is fixed to Z = 0.0002\nand Y = 0.23.\nFig. 1 shows, as an example, synthetic CMDs (without\nsimulation of photometric errors) for the selected chemical\ncomposition, a total absolute visual magnitude MVtot =\n\u22126 mag, and three different ages (500 Myr, 2 Gyr, and\n11 Gyr). All the evolutionary phases described above are\nclearly visible.\n\n2.2. Integrated magnitudes and colours\nTo compute integrated fluxes and magnitudes we assume\nthat the integrated light from the stellar population is\ndominated by light emitted by its stellar component. This\nimplies that i) no source of non-thermal emission are at\nwork, ii) the thermal emission by interstellar gas gives no\nsizeable contribution to the integrated flux, and iii) the\nabsorption from dust and gas are negligible. On this basis, the integrated flux in each photometric filter mainly\ndepend on two quantities. The first is the flux fi emitted\nby the i-th star of mass M , age t (stellar system age), lu-\n\nFig. 1. Synthetic CMDs\nthree different ages: 500\n11 Gyr (blue). For each\nadopted. The simulation\ncluded.\n\nfor Z = 0.0002, Y = 0.23 and\nMyr (black), 2 Gyr (red), and\npopulation MVtot = \u22126 mag is\nof photometric errors is not in-\n\nminosity l, effective temperature Tef f , and chemical composition (Y , Z):\nfi [l(M, t, Y, Z), Tef f (M, t, Y, Z), Y, Z].\n\n(3)\n\nfi is defined by the stellar evolutionary-tracks library, and\nby the adopted temperature-colours transformation tables.\nThe second quantity is \u03a6(M, N ) which describes the\nnumber of stars with mass M in a population globally constituted of N stars with age t and chemical composition\n(Y , Z). It is strictly related to the IMF.\nA fundamental point of our code is that the mass of\neach generated star is obtained by using Monte Carlo\ntechniques, while the mass distribution is ruled by the\nIMF. The mass of each star is generated randomly, and its\nproper evolutionary line is computed by interpolating the\navailable tracks in the mass grid. This method is crucial for\npoorly populated stellar systems, as we shall study in the\nfollowing. It ensures to treat undersampled evolutionary\nphases properly; for instance NIR colours may be dominated by a handful of red giant stars (Santos & Frogel\n1997; Brocato et al. 1999; Cervi\u00f1o & Valls-Gabaud 2003;\nRaimondo et al. 2005).\n\n\fFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\n5\n\nIn each model, stars are added until to reach a given\nvalue of the absolute visual magnitude, MV , at any age.\nThe mass values are generated randomly and distributed\naccording to the chosen IMF. It is relevant to note that\nthe random extraction of masses is fully independent from\nmodel to model even if the same input quantities (MV , t,\nN , Y , Z, IMF, etc.) are assumed.\nBoth the previous quantities (fi and \u03a6(M, N )) are\ncombined and integrated by the stellar population code\nto derive the total integrated flux F in a given photometric band:\nF [N, t, Y, Z] =\n\nN\nX\n\nfi ,\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nand the corresponding magnitudes.\n\n3. Comparison with Galactic Globular Clusters\nBefore studying the general behaviour of colours and\nmass-to-light ratios as a function of MV , the natural test\nfor SSP models is to compare their predictions to the observed properties of Galactic star clusters. Three old galactic globular clusters (GGCs) have been selected for checking our capability to reproduce both the CMD morphology\nof each cluster and the integrated magnitudes: NGC4590\n(M68), NGC7078 (M15) and NGC7099 (M30). They are\nall metal\u2013poor, span a relativity wide range of the visual magnitude (Table 1), and show different Horizontal\nBranch morphologies. This allows us to check the effect\nof HB morphologies on the integrated colours in the selected bands. The [F e/H] values estimated for the three\nclusters are, respectively, [F e/H] = \u22122.06, \u22122.26, \u22122.12\n(Harris 1996)3 , while the \u03b1-elements enhancement can be\nevaluated as [\u03b1/F e] \u2248 0.3 (see, e.g, the discussion in\nFerraro et al. 1999); thus we can assume Z \u2248 2 * 10\u22124 .\nWe include M15 due to its brightness (MV \u223c \u22129), even if\nit is recognized as a cluster which should have undergone\na gravothermal catastrophe. This results in a contraction\nof the cluster core while the external regions expand, with\nsome stars escape the system. As a possible consequence\nof such a dynamical evolution, observational evidence of\nmass segregation, and of radial color gradients have been\nfound (Bailyn et al. 1989; De Marchi & Paresce 1994;\nStetson 1994).\nFig. 2 shows the observed CMDs for the selected clusters. B and V photometry comes from the HST\u2013Snapshot\nCatalog by Piotto et al. (2002), except for M68 whose\ndata are from Walker (1994). The synthetic CMD which\nbetter reproduces the observational data is over-plotted as\nblack dots in each panel. For each cluster an age of 11 Gyr\nis assumed; we are not interested in a detailed calibration\nof the cluster ages which is far from our purpose. Results\nfor each comparison between synthetic and observed cluster are, briefly:\n3\nwww.physics.mcmaster.ca/resources/globular.html.\nFebruary 2003 version.\n\nFig. 2. Comparison between present synthetic (red dots),\nwithout the inclusion of simulated photometric errors, and\nthe observed CMDs of the globular clusters M68, M15 and\nM30 (black dots).

The values of the distance modulus and the\nreddening obtained from the analysis are also indicated.\n\u2013 M68 (NGC4590): We find (m \u2212 M )V = 15.29\nand EB\u2212V = 0.05 in agreement, within the uncertainties, with the current distance modulus and reddening\ndeterminations (e.g. Harris 1996; Carretta et al. 2000;\nDi Criscienzo et al. 2004).

The HB morphology is reproduced using \u03b7R = 0.44 and \u03c3\u03b7 = 0.1. The cluster contains one of the few planetary nebulae (PN) known in\nGGCs: the star K648 identified as a PN by Pease (1928),\nfor which Alves et al. (2000) measured an apparent magnitude of V = 14.73.\n\u2013 M30 (NGC7099): Assuming EB\u2212V = 0.05 we obtain\n(m \u2212 M )V = 14.93 in agreement with Sandquist et al.\n(1999).

The last values are strongly\nmodel\u2013dependent, as stressed by the authors themselves.\nHereinafter we will indicate dereddened colours as, e.g.,\nU \u2212 B instead of (U \u2212 B)0 .\nFor each cluster, numerical simulations were performed\nby populating the synthetic CMD until the observed MVtot\nof the cluster is reproduced (Sect. 2.1). Synthetic colours\nagree with data of all the clusters to within the uncertainties and theoretical statistical fluctuations. The only\nexception is the V \u2212 I colour of M15 that is found to\nbe redder than observations. The observed V \u2212 I colour of\nthis cluster is significantly bluer than that of other clusters\nwith similar metallicity (Harris 1996). On this regard, we\nrecall that the V \u2212I measure available is based on one photoelectric measurement only (Kron & Mayall 1960), and it\nis not possible to estimate the uncertainty (Reed 1985).\nTo investigate this issue, we use V I stellar photometry by\nRosenberg et al. (2000), which contains more than 90% of\nthe cluster light (MV \u2243 \u22129.1). By adding the flux of individual stars, we derive an integrated colour V \u2212 I \u2243 0.85,\nin fair agreement with our prediction. This value is larger\nthan the integrated value by Kron & Mayall (1960), even\nif it would be affected by incompleteness at the faint end\nof the observed luminosity function. To deeply investigate\nthe origin of the latter inconsistency is well beyond the\npurpose of this paper, what we wish to point out here is\nto notice that the observed integrated V \u2212 I colour of such\na cluster, reported in Table 1, could be peculiar and then\nnot representative of metal-poor clusters.\nAdditional indications may come from the analysis\nof M15 NIR colours. J \u2212 K prediction well agrees with\nthe value by Brocato et al. (1990) (J \u2212 K = 0.67, reddened), and is also consistent with data by Burstein et al.\n(1984) who found J \u2212 K = 0.62 (reddened). Interestingly,\nBurstein et al. (1984) also provide the observed (V \u2212K) =\n\n\fFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\n2.14 (reddened), that becomes (V \u2212 K) = 1.86 if corrected according to our reddening assumptions. By comparing this value with theory (V \u2212 K = 2.05), it appears\nthat our models predict V \u2212 K colour about 0.2 mag redder than observations. Unfortunately, a similar comparison cannot be done for M30 and M68, since they are not\nlisted by Burstein et al. (1984). Instead the authors observed M92 (NGC6341), whose metallicity is estimated to\nbe close to M15, being [F e/H] = \u22122.29. Since M92 is\nas bright as MV = \u22128.20, its colours data can be easily compared with our predictions as reported in Table 2,\nat age \u223c 11 \u2212 13 Gyr. Interestingly, the observed opticalNIR colour V \u2212 K = 2.13 well agrees with our prediction, together with all the optical colours U \u2212 B = 0.01,\nB \u2212 V = 0.61, and V \u2212 I = 0.86 (from Harris's catalog).\nIn conclusion, except for the peculiarity concerning\nM15, our models are able to properly predict the integrated colours of let's say 'normal' metal-poor clusters, as\nconfirmed by the comparison with observational data of\nM30, M68 (Table 1), and the additional cluster M92.\nAs noted above, M/L values reported in the last column of Table 1 (upper section), derived using isotropic\nKing models by Pryor & Meylan (1993), are strongly\nmodel\u2013dependent and thus the reported values are only indicative. Moreover dynamical processes such as star evaporation (e.g. Spitzer 1987; Vesperini & Heggie 1997), may\naffect the total mass and the inferred IMF shape as a\nfunction of time. Observed integrated colours of the selected clusters, as well as theoretical results, indicate that\nthey are not influenced by the HB morphology, at least in\nour modeled photometric bands. Shorter wavelength ultraviolet colours are expected to be more sensitive to the\npresence of an extended blue HB.\n\nFig. 4. V \u2212 K colour distribution resulting from 100 simulations for a model with 100 Myr, Z = 0.0002, and\nMVtot = \u22124 (solid) and -8 mag (dotted).\n\n7\n\n4. Integrated colours\nIn this section we examine the effects on integrated colours\nof stochastic fluctuations for different values of the assumed total absolute visual magnitude and the effects\nof the still present uncertainty on the IMF shape. The\nKroupa (2002) IMF is adopted for the standard model.\nResults are presented at fixed absolute visual magnitude to aid comparisons with observational data. For\nthese calculations the evaluation of the statistical fluctuations is fundamental. Statistical fluctuations of broadband colours as well as mass-to-light ratios have been evaluated by computing a series of 10 independent simulations\nfor a fixed set of population's parameters (Z, age, IMF,\n...) at fixed MVtot , and assuming a 1 \u03c3 error. When fluctuations become large, and the value above is not fully\nrepresentative of colours variations, we extend the analysis up to 100 runs. This is especially the case of very\npoorly populated clusters (MV = \u22124) and young ages.\nThe standard models are computed assuming: \u03b7R =\n0.3, \u03c3\u03b7 = 0.08 and Kroupa's IMF. As an example, Table\n2 and 3 reports integrated colours as function of age for\nmodels with MVtot = \u22128; Johnson-Cousins colours in Tab.2\nand HST colours in Tab.3. Table 2 lists from left to right:\nage, MVtot , integrated (U \u2212 B), (B \u2212 V ), (V \u2212 R), (V \u2212\nI),(V \u2212 J) and (V \u2212 K) colours. Table 3 reports from from\nleft to right: age, V \u2212F 439W 2, V \u2212F 555W 2, V \u2212F 814W 2\nfor the W F P C2 and V \u2212 F 110W 1, V \u2212 F 160W 1 for the\nN ICM OS camera.\n\n4.1. MVtot sensitivity\nOur standard synthetic models are calculated for three\ndifferent values of the total magnitude: MVtot = \u22128, \u22126\nand \u22124. (Note, that all the results for both broad-band\ncolours and mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios for MVtot = \u22126, and \u22124\nmodels are available as electronic tables at CDS).\nIn Fig. 3 the time evolution of selected integrated\ncolours are shown for the two extreme cases (MVtot = \u22128,\nblack circles, and \u22124, red triangles). In general, broad\u2013\nband colours become redder with age, because of the increasing fraction of cool stars in the populations. For the\nsame reason, the (U \u2212 B) colour is quite age-insensitive\nfor age >\n\u223c 1 Gyr.\nWithin the statistical uncertainties, the mean colours\nat different MVtot do not show significant differences, except in a few cases at young ages, and for optical\u2013NIR\ncolours. This is due to the strong variation of the number\nof very bright red stars affecting significantly the total\nluminosity of the cluster. In a SSP with a total brightness as faint as MVtot = \u22124, the most of stars occupy\nthe MS phase, and only a few (or none) red giants are\npresent, including stars burning He in the core and stars\nin the double shells phase (see for example Fig. 14 in\nRaimondo et al. 2005). Hence, the mean V \u2212 K colour\n(and to a less extent V \u2212 I) is generally bluer than in\nmodels with MVtot = \u22128, where post-MS phase is always\nwidely populated. This effect is large in young clusters, for\n\n\f8\n\nFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\nTable 2.

(1999)].\nTo clarify this point, Fig. 4 illustrates the V \u2212 K\ncolour distribution for a SSP model with age 100 Myr;\nfor each choice on MVtot , 100 simulations are computed.\nThe V \u2212 K colour distribution of faint clusters (solid line)\nshows a blue populous peak, due to the large fraction of\nsimulations containing mainly blue stars, and a few sparse\nsimulations at redder colours containing a few red giants.\nConsequently, the average colour is bluer than that found\nfor brighter clusters (Fig. 3), which show a broadened\ncolour distribution shifted towards the red side, since the\nprobability to have a large number of red stars is higher\n(dotted line in Fig. 4). We emphasize that in the present\npaper for a given cluster age, the integrated colours at different cluster brightness are obtained by properly adding\nstars in all evolutionary phases according to the IMF\nand evolutionary time-scales (i.e. keeping fixed the proportion between the number of stars in different stages).\nSo that, by decreasing their absolute magnitude (mass),\nthe natural trend is that the cluster progressively misses\npost-MS stars, and due to the discreteness of stars \"if an\nSSP is far less luminous, then there would be no post-MS\nstars and the integrated fluxes would be dominated by upper MS stars with little spread in color, which results in\nsmaller color fluctuations\" (Santos & Frogel 1997).

(1999), while\nopposite to what found by Bruzual & Charlot (2003). A\ndiscussion on the nature of such a discrepancy is beyond\nthe purpose of this paper, since it would required a deep\ncomparison between all the assumptions adopted in all the\ncodes (evolutionary tracks, atmospheres, etc.).\nIn general, for a further increase of the cluster brightness, the stochastic effects decrease, the colour distribution becomes more regular, and the standard deviation\nsqueezes (small spread in colour).\nAt a given age, the size of errorbars increases as the\ncluster luminosity decreases; this is due to the small number of stars present in faint clusters (MVtot = \u22124, red symbols) with respect to bright ones (MVtot = \u22128, black symbols). From the figure it is evident that for all ages the\nstatistical errors at MVtot = \u22124 are so high as to prevent\nprecise quantitative evaluations.\nThe errorbars also increase from B \u2212 V to V \u2212 K,\nas shown by Brocato et al. (1999). This last finding is related again to the expected small number of post-MS stars\nshining in the infrared wavelengths, especially in case of\nlow-luminosity clusters (MVtot = \u22124). Moreover, in faint\nclusters it may happen that giant stars are not present in\neach of the simulations we computed at fixed age, being\ntheir appearance highly driven by stochastic phenomena.\nAt fixed total magnitude the intrinsic uncertainty lowers\n\n\fFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\n9\n\nTable 3.

IMF variations\nTo evaluate the effect of IMF variations on integrated\ncolours we changed the Kroupa (2002) IMF exponent (x)\nwithin the estimated uncertainty for masses M > 0.5 M\u2299 .\nIn Fig. 5 models with MVtot = \u22128 calculated with the\nlower, central and upper value of the IMF exponent are\nplotted in selected pass-bands; the corresponding data tables are available as electronic tables at CDS.\nAs obtained for metal-rich models investigated in previous papers (see e.g. Maraston 1998; Brocato et al. 2000;\nYi 2003; Bruzual & Charlot 2003), we find that colours\nvariations are negligible also for very low-metallicity models, at least in the range of exponent investigated here,\nbeing the colours variations well within the intrinsic uncertainty, for both values of the brightness of the cluster\n(MVtot = \u22124 mag and \u22128). The errorbars behavior is similar to what described above: colour fluctuations increase\nfrom optical\u2013optical to optical\u2013NIR colours and for ages\n< 1 Gyr.\n\u223c\nChanging the distribution of very low mass stars\n(M \u2264 0.5 M\u2299 ) has negligible effects on photometric indices whatever the total visual magnitude, as already\n\nV \u2212 F 814W (2)\n0.0 \u00b1 0.2\n0.2 \u00b1 0.2\n0.2 \u00b1 0.1\n0.3 \u00b1 0.1\n0.4 \u00b1 0.1\n0.4 \u00b1 0.09\n0.42 \u00b1 0.07\n0.50 \u00b1 0.06\n0.60 \u00b1 0.07\n0.61 \u00b1 0.03\n0.63 \u00b1 0.04\n0.64 \u00b1 0.02\n0.66 \u00b1 0.03\n0.68 \u00b1 0.02\n0.72 \u00b1 0.02\n0.76 \u00b1 0.02\n0.76 \u00b1 0.02\n0.89 \u00b1 0.01\n0.81 \u00b1 0.02\n0.83 \u00b1 0.01\n0.83 \u00b1 0.01\n0.84 \u00b1 0.01\n0.84 \u00b1 0.02\n0.85 \u00b1 0.01\n0.86 \u00b1 0.01\n0.87 \u00b1 0.01\n0.87 \u00b1 0.02\n\nV \u2212 F 110W (1)\n0.0 \u00b1 0.3\n0.3 \u00b1 0.3\n0.3 \u00b1 0.1\n0.6 \u00b1 0.2\n0.6 \u00b1 0.2\n0.6 \u00b1 0.1\n0.7 \u00b1 0.1\n0.8 \u00b1 0.1\n0.9 \u00b1 0.1\n0.93 \u00b1 0.05\n0.99 \u00b1 0.06\n0.97 \u00b1 0.04\n0.99 \u00b1 0.05\n1.03 \u00b1 0.03\n1.07 \u00b1 0.03\n1.12 \u00b1 0.03\n1.11 \u00b1 0.03\n1.17 \u00b1 0.02\n1.18 \u00b1 0.03\n1.21 \u00b1 0.02\n1.22 \u00b1 0.02\n1.23 \u00b1 0.02\n1.23 \u00b1 0.01\n1.25 \u00b1 0.02\n1.27 \u00b1 0.02\n1.28 \u00b1 0.02\n1.28 \u00b1 0.02\n\nV \u2212 F 160W (1)\n0.0 \u00b1 0.5\n0.6 \u00b1 0.5\n0.6 \u00b1 0.3\n1.1 \u00b1 0.3\n1.2 \u00b1 0.4\n1.2 \u00b1 0.2\n1.2 \u00b1 0.2\n1.3 \u00b1 0.1\n1.5 \u00b1 0.1\n1.53 \u00b1 0.08\n1.57 \u00b1 0.10\n1.58 \u00b1 0.06\n1.61 \u00b1 0.08\n1.66 \u00b1 0.05\n1.71 \u00b1 0.05\n1.77 \u00b1 0.04\n1.75 \u00b1 0.04\n1.82 \u00b1 0.02\n1.84 \u00b1 0.04\n1.88 \u00b1 0.03\n1.90 \u00b1 0.03\n1.92 \u00b1 0.03\n1.91 \u00b1 0.02\n1.94 \u00b1 0.03\n1.97 \u00b1 0.03\n1.98 \u00b1 0.03\n1.97 \u00b1 0.04\n\nshown by Brocato et al. (2000) for ages greater than 5\nGyr. In poorly populated clusters (MVtot = \u22124 mag) as in\nthe richest ones (MVtot = \u22128 mag), reducing the number\nof stars with M < 0.5 M\u2299 does not affect the integrated\ncolours since the contribution of these stars to the total\nV light is only of the order of few percent (Brocato et al.\n2000). The contribution of such stars slightly increases\nwith age, but it remains comparable to the statistical errors even at the oldest ages (at least in the range explored\nhere).\n\n4.3. Comparison with previous works\nTable 4 summarizes the main ingredients used by various\nauthors in their synthesis code, and Fig. 6 compares the\ntime\u2013evolution of B \u2212 V and V \u2212 K colours of the present\nwork with similar recent results available in the literature.\nIn the figure our models are plotted with 1\u03c3 intrinsic error,\nwhile other authors do not estimate the colours statistical\nerrors, except for Brocato et al. (2000). If colours are not\navailable for exactly the same metallicity value adopted\nin the present work (Z = 0.0002), the two closest Z values are plotted. The models referred as Anders & Fritze-v.\nAlvensleben (2003) are the ones of the quoted paper, updated concerning emission lines by private communication\n(see also Schulz et al. 2002).\n\n\f10\n\nFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\nFig. 3. Time evolution of selected integrated colours in the standard UBVRIJHK filters for models with MVtot = \u22124\n(red triangles, dashed lines) and MVtot = \u22128 (black points, solid lines). For each model 1 \u03c3 colour dispersion is reported,\nsee text.\nThe present predictions well agree with those by\nBrocato et al. (2000). There is also a general good agreement with Kurth et al. (1999), and Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003), both based on Padua 1994 stellar evolutionary\ntracks (see the quoted papers for the detailed list of\nreferences). Differences can be found in the age range\n8.6 <\n\u223c log age(yr) <\n\u223c 9 for optical\u2013NIR colours, possibly\ndue to the treatment of the AGB and TP\u2013AGB phases.\nGirardi et al. (2000) and Anders & Fritze-v. Alvensleben\n(2003) predict redder colours than all the other authors for\n>\nage >\n\u223c 100 Myr, as well as Zhang et al. (2002) for age \u223c 3\nGyr. Differently from the others, both Maraston (2005)\nand our models are based on no-overshooting tracks.\nNevertheless, while the present B \u2212 V colours well agree\nwith Maraston's models at all ages in common, V \u2212 K\npredictions are bluer than those by Maraston (2005) at\nages younger than \u2243 3 Gyr.\nFig. 6 shows that the B\u2212V and V \u2212K predictions from\ndifferent authors agree within 0.1 mag at log age >\n\u223c 9.3.\nLarge model-to-model differences arise at young and intermediate ages, when the contribution of AGB and TP-AGB\nstars to the total flux is high, especially in the NIR bands\n(see for a discussion Maraston 1998; Girardi & Bertelli\n1998). This has a direct consequence on predicted colours,\n\nsince a large variety of stellar ingredients and prescriptions\nare used to simulate these phases. Temperature-colours relations, mass-loss prescriptions, and analytical description\nof the TP evolution all affect the photometric properties\nof such kind of stars, thus it is not straightforward to\nindividuate a single origin (or multiple ones) to explain\ndifferences shown in Fig. 6 in the intermediate-age range.\nFor instance, mass-loss processes affecting TP\u2013AGB\nstars are one of the physical mechanisms largely affecting the TP-AGB stars evolution. However, the effect of\nmass loss on the observational properties of TP stars are\nlargely unknown to date. To give an indication on how\nmass-loss may affects colour predictions, we made numerical experiments by computed integrated colours in the\nextreme case when no TP\u2013AGB stars are present in the\npopulation, to mimic in such a way a very efficient massloss rate (see also Maraston 1998). As expected, the effect is larger for intermediate-age populations, and in the\noptical-NIR colours. The V \u2212K colour becomes bluer than\nthe standard value by \u223c 0.5 mag at age = 500 Myr,\nand the B \u2212 V colour decreases only by 0.06 mag at the\nsame age. This effect tends to vanish by increasing the\nage.

(2005) for surface brightness fluctuation colours.\n\n5. Mass-to-light ratio\nTable 6 lists our predictions for the mass-to-light ratio\n(M/L) in various photometric bands as function of age for\nMVtot = \u22128; similar tables for MVtot = \u22126 and MVtot = \u22124\nare available at CDS.\nThe total mass M includes all the evolving stars up\nto the AGB tip (M \u2265 0.1 M\u2299) and WDs. Stars with mass\nhigher than Mup = 7 M\u2299 are assumed to leave a neutron star (NS) as a remnant. To evaluate the maximum\nmass fraction of NS we set the neutron star mass at its\nupper limit (\u2248 2 M\u2299 , see e.g. Bombaci et al. 2004), and\nwe choose high cluster age (\u2248 12 Gyr); we found that\nthe NS mass fraction constitutes at maximum few percent of the cluster mass in agreement with the calculations by Vesperini & Heggie (1997) who found an upper\nvalue of \u2248 1%. The contribution of massive black holes to\nthe total mass depends on assumption on the mass of the\nremnant and IMF (Maraston 2005). By using the same\nprescriptions on black holes mass as Maraston (2005), we\n\nestimated that for a Kroupa IMF the mass fraction of both\nneutron stars and black holes does not exceed 5-10%.\nIn this paper, the M/L values are calculated without taking into account any dynamical processes, e.g.\nevaporation of stars due to two body relaxation or disk\nshocking (see e.g. Spitzer 1987; Vesperini & Heggie 1997;\nBoily et al. 2005). A treatment of these phenomena is beyond the scope of this work; N-body simulations showing the effects of this processes on the total mass and\nIMF shape as a function of time, and on the galactocentric distance of the cluster can be found in e.g.\nVesperini & Heggie (1997). We only note that since stellar evaporation is more efficient for low mass stars, one\nexpects a flattening of the IMF as the dynamical evolution of a cluster proceeds. Evaluations of the mass fraction\nof WDs expected to be lost from clusters due to dynamical evaporation can be found in Vesperini & Heggie (1997)\n(see also Fellhauer et al. 2003; Hurley & Shara 2003). The\npresence of binary stars is not taken into account as well;\nthe lack of information about the binary frequency, the\ndistribution of binaries of different mass ratios, the separation of the components, and the occurrence of explosion\nof novae and supernovae prevents a quantitative treatment of this phenomenon. An attempt to include binary\nsystems in population synthesis models has recently been\npresented by Zhang et al. (2005).\nIn Fig. 7 we show the influence of VLM stars (M \u2264\n0.6 M\u2299 ) and WDs on the M/L, L is the bolometric luminosity in solar units, at fixed absolute visual magnitude\n\n\f12\n\nFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\nTable 4.

The quoted values for the overshooting\n(OS) efficiency, expressed in unit of pressure-scale-height above the Schwarzschild convective border, are only indicative\nbecause different sets of evolutionary tracks adopt different prescriptions for the overshooting mechanisms and for the\nminimum mass at which the overshooting is fully efficient (see the related papers for more details); Y=YES; N=NO.\nWD indicates if white dwarfs are included in the calculations; M/L if mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio values are available.

As already known, VLM and WDs provide a\nnearly negligible contribution to the total luminosity (see\nfor example Maraston 1998), while give a significative contribution to the total mass. Fig. 7 shows that the fraction\nof low mass stars and white dwarfs increases with the cluster age (see also Maraston 1998). Note that, since the simulations are performed at fixed absolute visual magnitude,\nthe total mass of the cluster varies with age, as shown in\nFig. 8, where we plot the case of MV = \u22128. This is because as the age increases the mass of the typical star in\nthe cluster decreases.\n\nChanging Mup affects the number of stars cooling as\nWDs, or in other words the mass fraction locked as WDs,\nand thus the cluster total mass. Different input ingredients of stellar evolutionary tracks, as e.g. the neutrino\nenergy losses in the core, lead to different predictions\nof Mup at fixed metallicity, see e.g. Tornambe & Chieffi\n(1986, Mup = 5.7 M\u2299 ), Pols et al. (1998, Mup = 5 M\u2299 ),\nDominguez et al. (1999, Mup = 6.5 M\u2299 ), Cariulo et al.\n(2004, Mup = 5 \u00f7 6 M\u2299 ). We explore the effect of changing Mup . We find that increasing Mup from 5 up to 7 M\u2299\ndoes not cause variations in the mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios, at\nleast for the adopted IMF. Even pushing Mup up to 10M\u2299\ndoes not cause sensitive change in the mass-to-light ratios\n(Table 5).\n\n0.1\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.3\n\u22120.5\nlog(Mtot/Mtotmax)\n\nAuthors\n\n\u22120.7\n\u22120.9\n\u22121.1\n\u22121.3\n\u22121.5\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\nlog[age(yr)]\n\n9.5\n\n10\n\n10.5\n\nFig. 8.

On the\ncontrary, other than this effect mass-to-light ratios in the\nNIR bands suffer a larger scatter due to the decrease of red\ngiants contributors to the total NIR luminosity, as shown\nin the right lower panel of the figure for K-band.\n\nSince MVtot is fixed, the behaviour of (M/LV ) as a\nfunction of the age reflects the trend of the cluster mass\n(Fig. 8); it is quite linear for ages \u2265 1 Gyr in all passbands indicating it is driven by the grown of the total\nmass. For ages \u2264 1 Gyr NIR colours are flatter than the\noptical (U, B, V ) ones due to the increase of the infrared\nluminosity following the develop of an extended asymptotic giant branch.

Time evolution of M/L (in solar units) in selected passbands (U, B, V, K) for models with MVtot = \u22128\ncalculated with the lower, central and upper value for the Kroupa (2002) IMF exponent for M \u2264 0.5M\u2299 . Black dots\nindicate our reference model (\u03b1 = 1.3), red triangles indicate models with x=0.8 and blue stars models with \u03b1 = 1.8.\nspectively. Models with MVtot = \u22128 mag are plotted in\nselected passbands while results for other passbands and\nfor MVtot = \u22124 mag are available at CDS.\nThe M/L ratio is more sensitive than integrated\ncolours to the IMF shape, as already noted by Maraston\n(1998); Bruzual & Charlot (2003); Maraston (2005). From\nFig. 11 it is evident that, by decreasing the IMF slope at\nM \u2264 0.5M\u2299 , the mass of the system decreases, while\nthe luminosity remains almost constant. The final effect is\nto have smaller M/L ratios than in the standard models\n(\u03b1 = 1.3). At age lower than few billion years, the uncertainty due to stochastic effects is comparable or larger\nthan the effects of exponent variations. Indeed, the IMF\nvariations can be appreciated at ages of the order of\n1010 yr. We also find that the uncertainty predicted for\nMVtot = \u22124 models prevents to detect significant variations at any age.\nA different situation is found in Fig. 12. The mass-tolight ratios slightly depend on IMF for age younger than\na few billion years, while they are nearly insensitive at\nold age. This is because an IMF flatter than \u03b1 = 2.3 at\nM \u2265 0.5 (red triangles) requires a total mass smaller than\nin the standard case (\u03b1 = 2.3, black circles) to reach the\ngiven luminosity, thus predicting low M/LV . The effect is\nenhanced in young stellar populations in which the total\nmass is dominated by massive stars. On the other hand, by\nincreasing the exponent up to 2.6 (blue stars), the cluster\nmass needed to have MV = \u22128 increases, leading to high\n\nM/L values. Again, mass-to-light ratios in the NIR bands\nare more affected by stochastic phenomena.\nFinally, note that in the case of small variations (\u03b1 =\n2 \u00f7 2.6) explored here, the contribution of massive remnants to the total mass does not significantly change, while\nit is shown to be effective if large variations (\u03b1 = 0.5\u00f73.5)\nare adopted, see for a discussion Maraston (1998).\n\n6. Summary and conclusions\nIn this work we have analyzed the intrinsic uncertainties\ndue to stochastic effects on integrated colours and mass\u2013\nto\u2013light ratios of metal-poor stellar clusters as a function\nof the total visual magnitude. The calculations are performed for three different values of MVtot and for a fine\ngrid of stellar ages. Statistical errors are shown to be crucial, especially in the extreme case MVtot = \u22124 they are so\nhigh as to prevent precise quantitative evaluations for all\nages. Calculations are done in the standard UBVRIJHK\nphotometric passbands and in the Hubble Space Telescope\nbands (WFPC2 and NICMOS systems).\nWe checked the consistency of our models on observational properties of three metal poor clusters, namely M68,\nM15, and M30, which differ mainly in the absolute visual\nmagnitude, and HB morphology. For each cluster we were\nable to reproduce both the features of the observed CMD\nand the integrated colours, showing that the HB morphology does not influence the photometric indices taken into\naccount.\n\n\fFagiolini et al.: Monte Carlo Simulations of Metal Poor Star Clusters\n\n17\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\nlog(M/LB)\n\nlog(M/LU)\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22122\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\nlog[age(yr)]\n\n9.5\n\n\u22121.5\n7.5\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\nlog[age(yr)]\n\n9.5\n\n10\n\n9\nlog[age(yr)]\n\n9.5\n\n10\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\nlog(M/LK)\n\nlog(M/LV)\n\n\u22120.25\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22120.75\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121.5\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\nlog[age(yr)]\n\n9.5\n\n10\n\n\u22121.25\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\nFig. 12.

Black dots\nindicate our reference model (\u03b1 = 2.3), red triangles indicate models with \u03b1 = 2.0, and blue stars indicate models\nwith \u03b1 = 2.6.\nA comparisons with recent results available in the literature shows, in some cases, non-negligible differences due\nto the large variety of prescriptions used in the model calculations.\nThe uncertainties in the results on both colours and\nmass\u2013to\u2013light ratios due to the still present uncertainty on\nthe IMF shape have been quantitatively estimated; while\nthe colours fluctuations remains within theoretical uncertainties the M/L ratio is more sensitive to the IMF shape.\nWe also showed that the influence on M/L of the adopted\nvalue for the minimum mass for which carbon burning is\nignite is quite negligible.\nAcknowledgements.
