Orbital periods and other parameters of symbiotic\nbinary systems in the LMC and SMC are presented and discussed.

In particular, the symbiotic stars in the MCs are compared with those in the Milky Way.\nKey Words: MAGELLANIC CLOUDS - STARS: SYMBIOTIC - STARS: BINARY SYSTEMS -\nSTARS: PARAMETERS\n\nSymbiotic stars are long-period interacting binary systems in which an evolved giant star (normal\ngiant in S-types, and Mira variable surrounded by\nthick dust envelope in D-types, respectively) transfers material to its much hotter compact companion.\nSuch a composition places them among the intrinsically brighest variable stars that can be easily detected in nearby galaxies, in particular in the Magellanic Clouds (MC). At present the number of confirmed symbiotics is at 6 in the SMC and 8 in the\nLMC (e.g. Belczy\u0144ski et al. 2000). Here, I present\nand discuss some physical parameters of MC symbiotic stars derived from available observational data,\nin particular, those contained in MACHO, 2MASS,\nIUE and HST databases.\nThe MACHO/OGLE II light curves of SMC 3\nhave been recently discussed by Kahabka (2004) who\nfound evidence for \u223c 1600d orbital modulation, in\naddition to 110d pulsation of the M0 giant component. The MACHO light curves for LMC systems,\nS63, N19 and S147 are shown in Figure 1 together\nwith the corresponding power spectra. In all cases\nthere is a strong periodicity of the order of 1000d,\nwhich can be due to orbital motion. For LMC N19,\nstrong variability in U light was reported by Morgan (1996) who also gave dates both when the star\nwas was faint and bright. Combining this information with our light curves, we find that epochs of\nrelative faintness reported by Morgan and the deep\nminima in the light curves follow the ephemeris:\nMJD Min = 50 632 + 946 \u00d7 E. Similarly, the IUE\nfluxes in LMC S63 observed in 1982 (maximum of\nthe 1060d periodicity) are higher than those in 1994\n(ingres) as expected for orbital modulation. For\n1 N.\n\nCopernicus Astronomical Center, Warsaw, Poland\n\nFig. 1. MACHO light curves for LMC N19 (top), LMC\nS63 (middle), and LMC S147 (bottom), and the corresponding power spectra. The blue and red channel data\nare plotted as open and filled circles (light curves), and\nsolid and dashed lines (periodograms), respectively.\n\nLMC S147, the situation is more complicated, and\nadditional observations (U photometry and/or spectroscopy) are needed to confirm orbital origin of the\nmodulation visible in its light curves. In N19 there is\nalso strong periodicity at \u223c 80d which may be due to\nradial pulsation of the M4 giant component, similar\nto that found in SMC 3 (Kahabka 2004).\n2MASS colors of MC systems and the H-R diagrams for the red giants are shown in Figure 2a,b.\nMC systems contain low mass, \u2264 3 M\u2299 , giants as\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMIKOlAJEWSKA\n\nFig. 2. (a) Color-color diagram for MC symbiotic stars from 2MASS (open stars correspond to the SMC and filled stars\nto the LMC systems, respectively). For comparison, galactic systems from Munari et al. (1992) and 2MASS are also\nplotted (closed and open circles represent S- and D-type systems, respectively). The shaded regions denote planetary\nnebulae (PNe) and Be stars. Full lines mark the locii of luminosity class III stars and LPVs, and dashed line represent\nblack bodies. (b) H-R diagram for the symbiotic giants. Symbols for galactic systems (Mikolajewska 2004; only system\nwith measured red giant radii, and thus with accurate distances, are plotted) and MC systems are the same as in\n(a). Evolutionary tracks (Hurley et al. 2000) for low mass AGB (dashed) and RGB (solid) stars for different Z are\nalso plotted. Note the position of the very low Z galactic system AG Dra in the region occupied by the SMC systems.\n(c) H-R diagram for the hot components. Galactic (Mikolajewska 2004) and MC systems (M\u00fcrset et al. 1996; this study)\nare plotted as circles and stars, whereas whereas filled and open symbols represent the S- and D-systems, respectively.\nSquares correspond to data for AG Dra. Evolutionary tracks for the cooling white dwarfs (Sch\u00f6nberner 1989), and\nconstant radii are plotted as solid and dashed lines, respectively.\n\ndo their galactic cousins, however only AGB giants\nare found in MC systems. Four D-type systems in\nthe LMC of 8 total, wheras no a D-type system in\nthe SMC are found. The later result is surprising because non dusty, S-type galactic systems rarely contain AGB giants. The lack of dusty systems among\nthe SMC symbiotics may reflect the very low Z in\nthe SMC, too low to form enough dust in the giant\nenvelope.\nThe hot components of the galactic and MC systems overlap in the H-R diagram (Figure 2c) but\nMC systems are among the hottest and the brightest. This together with the fact that all MC systems\ncontain AGB giants is probably due to that only the\nbrightest symbiotic systems have been detected in\nthe MCs. It is, however notable that the hot component of AG Dra, the galactic symbiotic with the\nlowest measured Z \u223c 0.002 is also among the hottest\nsystems. Further studies are necessary to study the\neffect of metallicity on the symbiotic appearance.\nSummarising, the first orbital periods for MC\nsymbiotic systems have been found, all in the range\n900\u20131600 days which is consistent with the longer\nperiod tail of galactic S-type systems (Mikolajewska\n2003). MC symbiotics are low mass systems as their\ngalactic cousins. Although the MC sample is biased\ntowards the hottest and the brightest systems there\n\nis some evidence for nonegligible metallicity effect on\nthe symbiotic phenomenon.\nI gratefully acknowledge the financial support\nfrom the LOC, IAU, and KBN Research Grant\nNo. 5P03D 019 20.
