We estimate the sensitivity of\nthe ILC for the noncommutative scale \u039bNC . Comparing with earlier estimates for\nthe LHC, we demonstrate the complementarity of the experiments at the two colliders.\n\n1\n\nThe Model\n\nA noncommutative (NC) structure of space-time\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = i\n\nC \u03bc\u03bd\n\u039b2NC\n\n(1)\n\nintroduces a new energy scale \u039bNC . The motivations of (1) that are provided by string\ntheory and quantum gravity place this scale in the vicinity of the corresponding Planck\nscale: \u039bNC \u2248 MPl . If MPl \u2248 1019 GeV, (1) is unlikely to be ever probed directly by collider\nexperiments. However, in models with additional space dimensions MPl can be as low as the\nTerascale and, as a result, \u039bNC can be in the reach of future TeV scale colliders, like LHC\nand ILC. Therefore, quantum field theories on NC space-time (NCQFT), in particular NC\nextensions of the standard model (SM), are interesting objects for collider phenomenology.\nUsing methods developed for studying NCQFT at the LHC [2], we have estimated the\ndiscovery potential of the ILC and the sensitivity to the NC parameters (1).\nIn this study, we assume a canonical structure of NC space-time, i. e. a constant antisymmetric 4 \u00d7 4 matrix C \u03bc\u03bd in (1) that commutes with all the x\u0302\u03bc . For convenience, we\nparametrize C \u03bc\u03bd in analogy to the electromagnetic field-strength tensor and denote the time~ and the space-like components C ij by B.\n~ Instead of constructing\nlike components C 0i by E\nNCQFT directly in terms of the operators x\u0302, we encode the NC structure (1) of space-time\nby means of a deformed product of functions on an ordinary commuting space-time, the so\ncalled Moyal-Weyl \u22c6-product:\ni\n\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\nf (x) \u22c6 g(x) = f (x)e 2 \u2202\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd\n\ng(x) .\n\n(2)\n\nFor the implementation of the gauge structure of the SM, we use the framework introduced in [3], where the Lie algebra valued gauge and matter fields A\u03be and \u03c8 are mapped to\nuniversal enveloping algebra valued fields \u00c2\u03be [A, \u03b8] and \u03c8\u0302[A, \u03c8, \u03b8], allowing the SU (N ) gauge\ngroups and fractional U (1)-charges of the SM on NC space-time. These so-called Seiberg\nWitten Maps (SWM) are defined as solutions of the following gauge equivalence equations,\nthat express the requirement that the NC gauge transformations are realized by ordinary\ngauge transformations:\n\n\u2217 Speaker\n\n[1]\n\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\u03b4\u0302\u03b1 \u00c2\u03bc (A, \u03b8) = \u03b4\u03b1 \u00c2\u03bc (A, \u03b8)\n\n(3a)\n\n\u03b4\u0302\u03b1 \u03c8\u0302(\u03c8, A, \u03b8) = \u03b4\u03b1 \u03c8\u0302(\u03c8, A, \u03b8) .\n\n(3b)\n\n\fThe solutions of (3) can be obtained as an expansion in powers of \u03b8. While we have constructed the most general second order expressions recently [4], we will restrict ourselves\nhere to the first order in \u03b8 to be consistent with the existing LHC study [2].\nThe construction sketched in the previous paragraph introduces momentum dependent\ncorrections to the SM vertices, as well as new vertices that are absent in the SM, e. g.\nf f \u0304V V contact interactions among fermions and gauge bosons. In addition, the gauge boson\nsector of the NCSM shows a new feature, characteristic to the universal algebra valued\napproach [3]. The action depends on the choice of the representation, resulting in different\nversions of the model: the minimal NCSM containing no triple couplings among neutral\ngauge bosons and the nonminimal NCSM, where such triple gauge boson (TGB) couplings,\nthat are forbidden in the SM, appear. The coupling strength of TGB interactions are not\nuniquely fixed in the nonminimal NCSM, but constrained to a finite domain (see Figure 1,\nleft). An important aspect of our phenomenological analysis is probing different values of\nthese couplings at the ILC and deriving the corresponding sensitivity on the NC scale \u039bNC .\nThis will reveal a complementarity with measurements at the LHC.\n\n2\n\nPhenomenology\n\nWe perform a phenomenological analysis of the unpolarized scattering process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3\nin the minimal as well as in the nonminimal NCSM. The final state was selected to contain a\nZ-boson, since the axial coupling of the Z is crucial for a non-cancellation of the NC effects\nafter summing over polarizations [5, 2].\nIn the minimal NCSM, the O(\u03b8) contribution to the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3 scattering amplitude is\ngiven by the diagrams\n\n,\nwhereas in the nonminimal NCSM two additional s-channel diagrams\n\nKZ\u03b3\u03b3\n\nKZZ\u03b3\n\nhave to be added, introducing a dependence on KZ\u03b3\u03b3 and KZZ\u03b3 .\n2.1\n\nDependence on the Azimuthal Angle\n\nA NC structure of space-time as introduced in (1), breaks Lorentz invariance, including\nrotational invariance around the beam axis. This leads to a dependence of the cross section\non the azimuthal angle, that is otherwise absent in the SM, as well as in most other models\n~\nof physics beyond the SM (see Figure 1, right). In principle, we can distinguish E-type\nand\n~\nB-type NC contributions by their different dependence on the polar scattering angle: the\n~ 6= 0 and it is symmetric for B\n~ 6= 0.\ndifferential cross section is antisymmetric in cos \u03b8 for E\n~\n~\nHowever, the dependence of the cross section on E is much stronger than the one on B,\nwhich will make it very hard to discover the latter at the LHC [2].\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\f\u221a\n\n0.22\n\nK5\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nK6\n\n0\n\n~ = (1, 0, 0), B\n~ = ~0\nE\n\ns = 1 TeV\n\n\u039bNC = 1 TeV\n\n0.18\n\n\u22120.1\nKZ\u03b3\u03b3\n\nK4\n\n\u22120.2\nK3\n\n0.16\nd\u03c3\n/pb\nd\u03a9\n0.14\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0.12\n\nK1\n\nK2\n\n\u22120.4\n\ncos \u03b8 = 0.8\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nKZZ\u03b3\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03c6\n\nFigure 1: Left: The allowed region for the values of the couplings KZ\u03b3\u03b3 and KZZ\u03b3 in the\nnonminimal NCSM. Right: Azimuthal dependence of the cross section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3, in\nthe nonminimal NCSN with different values for the TGB couplings: K1 = (\u22120.333, 0.035)\n(solid) and K5 = (0.095, 0.155) (dotted), and in the minimal NCSM (dashed).\n2.2\n\nDependence on the Coupling Constants\n\nSince the t- and u-channel diagrams as well as the contact term are proportional to Q2 , Q\nbeing the particle charge in the initial state, the cross section in the minimal NCSM depends\nonly on the modulus |Q|. In contrast, in the nonminimal NCSM, the interference with the\ns-channel diagrams adds a Q3 term to the cross section and the cross section also depends\non sgn(Q). As a result, NC effects in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3 are maximally enhanced by the s-channel\ncontribution for the pairs of couplings K1 and K2 , corresponding to the lower edge of the\npolygon in Figure 1, left. However, the same couplings lead to cancellations of the NC\neffects for u\u016b scattering resulting in minimal deviations of the NCSM with respect to the\nSM. In this sense, the ILC will nicely complement the LHC. On the other hand, the pair\nof couplings K5 , which produces maximal effects at the LHC, will lead to an NCSM cross\nsection comparable to the one where the TGB couplings vanish.\n2.3\n\nMonte Carlo Simulations for the ILC\n\nIn order to estimate the sensitivity of the ILC on the NC scale \u039bNC , we have performed\nMonte Carlo simulations using\n\u221a the event generator WHIZARD [6]. In the analysis we used\na center of mass energy of s = 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of L = 500 fb\u22121 .\nA typical signature for new physics is a modified pT -distribution. Previously, we have\nstudied pp \u2192 Z\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03b3 at the LHC and the deviation from the SM pT (\u03b3) distribution\ncould not be resolved due to the poor statistics and complicated cuts [2]. However, the high\nstatistics and the clean initial state of the ILC, allows deviations of the NCSM from the SM\nto be seen also in the pT distribution for reasonable values of \u039bNC (see Figure 2, left). Of\ncourse, cuts with respect to the azimuthal angle \u03c6 have to be applied, because otherwise all\nO(\u03b8) interference effects will cancel, since the events \"missing\" in one hemisphere (e. g. for\n\u03c0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0) are compensated by the \"excess\" of events in the other. Figure 2, right, shows\nthis distribution exemplarily, where for the TGB couplings we have chosen the set of values,\nfor which we expect the largest deviation from the SM distribution in electron-positron\nscattering, i. e.

Right: Monte Carlo simulation for the azimuthal\ndependence of the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3 at the ILC.\nAs shown in [2], the strong boost along the beam axis from the partonic to the hadronic\nCMS at the LHC induces kinematical correlations between (E1 , B2 ) and (E2 , B1 ), respectively. Thus, in the laboratory frame we always deal with an entanglement of time- and\n~ and B\n~ paramspace-like noncommutativity. Fortunately, the different properties of the E\neters with respect to the partonic scattering angle discussed in section 2.1 allows separate\nmeasurements of the time- and space-like components of \u03b8. Integrating just over one hemi~\nsphere (i. e. \u22120.9 < cos \u03b8\u2217 < 0 or 0 < cos \u03b8\u2217 < 0.9) we can perform a measurement of E,\n~\nsince the B dependence is negligibly small. On the other hand, an integration over the whole\n~ since the\nsphere (i. e. \u22120.9 < cos \u03b8\u2217 < 0.9) in principle provides a pure measurement of B,\n~\neffect of E will completely cancel out, due to its antisymmetry.\nOne advantage of the ILC compared to the LHC is the only mildly boosted initial state.\nWe have an e+ e\u2212 initial state, where only beamstrahlung has to be accounted for, which we\nhave done, using CIRCE [7] inside WHIZARD [6]. This will lead to a boost of the CMS of the\nelectrons to the laboratory frame. Yet, compared to the LHC, this boost is negligibly small:\nh|\u03b2ILC |i = 0.14 versus h|\u03b2LHC |i = 0.8. We therefore have negligible correlations between E1\nand B2 or E2 and B1 , respectively, and we can derive the bounds on \u039bNC separately for the\n~ or purely B\n~ noncommutativity.\ncase of purely E\n\n3\n\nResults and Conclusions\n\nFocussing on the azimuthal dependency (Figure 2) we have performed likelihood fits similar\nto the ones described in [2] in order to derive bounds on the NC scale \u039bNC . The results are\nsummarized in Table 1. In contrast to the LHC case, the ILC is sensitive on all noncommutative parameters, time-like and space-like, as well as on all values of the TGB couplings.\nThe ILC is especially sensitive on the couplings lying in the lower region of the polygon of\nFigure 1. These are exactly the set of TGB couplings for which the LHC is less sensitive,\nwhile the TGB couplings leading to maximal deviations at the LHC, lead to minimal effects\nat the ILC. Thus, probing the TGB couplings at the ILC is complementary to searches at\nthe LHC.
