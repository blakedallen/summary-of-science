Introduction\nIn 1981, Unruh suggested [1] that the analogue of black hole radiation could be observed\nin a quantum fluid that crosses the speed of sound, thereby forming a sonic horizon.\nSince then, several types of fluids and several types of flows were considered [2]. Very\nrecently, a near-stationary supersonic flow engendering a pair of horizons (a black hole\none followed by a white hole one) was realized in a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate [3]. In\nsuch a background, because of the anomalous dispersion of Bogoliubov phonons, one\nexpects to get a kind of laser effect [4]\u2013[6] due to a self-amplification of the Hawking\nradiation.\nThe first aim of this paper is to provide the theoretical basis of this effect starting\nfrom the Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equation, i.e. without making use of the gravitational\nanalogy. In this we apply to flows containing two horizons the treatment of [7] that\nwas only applied to a single (black hole or white hole) sonic horizon. Following [6] we\nthen establish that the laser effect is governed by a discrete set of complex frequency\nmodes that correspond to the resonant modes of the cavity formed by the region\nbordered by the two horizons. In a classical description, this discrete set governs\nthe dynamical instability of the flow. The second aim is to compute the spectrum\n2\n\n\f3\nof the complex frequency modes by theoretical and numerical methods. The excellent\nagreement of the results validates both the concepts and the semi-classical methods used\nin the theoretical approach. Finally we consider two observables: the mean number\nof emitted phonons, and the two-point function of the phonon field that governs the\ndensity\u2013density correlation pattern [8, 9]. At sufficiently late time, both observables\nare governed by a single mode, the most unstable one. In this late time regime, their\nbehaviours are identical to those one would obtain using a classical description of the\ndensity perturbations. At early time instead, when starting from vacuum configurations,\ncorrespondence with the quantum phonon flux emitted by a black hole horizon [7] is\nestablished.\nThe propagation of phonons in flows containing two horizons has already been\nconsidered. However, toroidal configurations with periodic boundary conditions were\ngenerally used [10, 11]. In that case, the spectrum is very complicated because it results\nfrom a combination of two effects: the discreteness of the wave vectors defined on the\ntorus interferes with that associated with modes that are trapped in the supersonic\nregion. As a result, not only the analysis is difficult, but the relationships with the\nHawking effect and the black hole laser effect [4]\u2013[6] are hard to draw. On the contrary,\nwhen dealing with continuous wave vectors, the analysis of the complex frequency mode\nis simpler, and the relationship with Hawking radiation is easily made.\nWe have organized this paper as follows. In section 2 we present the Bogoliubov\u2013de\nGennes equation in a way that is suitable for our aims. In section 3 we determine the\nspectrum of asymptotically bound modes, and explain why complex frequency modes\nappear when the speed of sound is twice crossed. We then compute the eigen\u2013frequencies\nusing semi-classical methods. In section 4 we numerically solve the Bogoliubov\u2013de\nGennes equation and compute the spectrum. We then evaluate the mean occupation\nnumber and compare it with the spectrum one would obtain if only the black hole\nhorizon were present. We finally evaluate the correlation pattern of the density\u2013density\ntwo-point function.\n2. Framework\n2.1. Black-hole\u2013white-hole geometries\nUsing the analogy [1, 2] between the wave equation governing sound propagation in\na moving fluid and that governing light propagation in a curved space-time, one can\nassociate an acoustic geometry to the fluid flow. In 1+1 dimensions, these geometries\nare of the form [4]\nds2 = \u2212c2 dt2 + (dx \u2212 vdt)2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere v is the flow velocity and c the speed of sound. In this language, a black-hole\u2013\nwhite-hole geometry is obtained when v crosses twice c. Indeed, a sonic horizon is\npresent whenever v crosses c. Assuming that the fluid flows from right to left (v < 0),\nthe location xH of a horizon is given by c(xH ) + v(xH ) = 0. In our case, we set the\n\n\f4\nlocation of the white hole horizon and that of the black hole respectively to xW = \u2212L\nand xB = L. These divide the x-axis in three regions, which we call I on the left of the\nwhite horizon (x < \u2212L), II between the two horizons (\u2212L < x < L) and III on the\nright of the black horizon (x > L). The flow is supersonic in the internal region II and\nsubsonic otherwise. The opposite case where the velocity is subsonic inside does not\ngive rise to a laser effect, and will be considered elsewhere.\nIn the present work, our analysis is restricted to the following stationary profiles:\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013n \u0015\n\u0013n \u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n\u03baB |x \u2212 L|\n\u03baW |x + L|\n1/n\n1/n\n2\n2\ntanh\n, (2)\nc(x) + v(x) = cH D sign(x \u2212 L ) tanh\ncH D\ncH D\nwhich generalize to two horizons those used in [7]. cH is the sound speed at the horizons,\n2L is the distance between them, D determines the size of the near-horizon regions where\nthe metric is not flat, n controls the sharpness of the transition to the flat regions, and\n\u03baW and \u03baB control the surface gravities. Indeed, the surface gravity is defined by [2]\ngs =\n\n1 d(c2 \u2212 v 2 )\n2\ndx\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nx=xH\n\nwhich yields \u2212cH \u03baW for the white hole and cH \u03baB for the black hole. The metric (1) is\nthen completely fixed by introducing an extra parameter q:\nc(x) = cH + (1 \u2212 q)[c(x) + v(x)],\nv(x) = \u2212cH + q[c(x) + v(x)],\n\n(4)\n\nwhich specifies how c + v is shared between c and v. When restricting to the cases where\nc(x) > 0,\n\nv(x) < 0,\n\nD > 0,\n\n(5)\n\nthe range of D and q is limited. The allowed values are graphically illustrated by the\nshaded area in figure 1, left panel. Three velocity profiles corresponding to different\ncouples (q, D) are plotted in figure 1, right panel.\n2.2. Density perturbations in Bose Einstein condensates\nWe present the main steps leading to the equations for linear density perturbations in\nBose\u2013Einstein condensates [12], having in mind cases where the condensate crosses the\nspeed of sound. We follow [7], where more details can be found.\nAt low temperature, the quantum properties of a gas of weakly interacting atoms\nare efficiently described by a second quantized field satisfying the commutation relation\n[\u03a8\u0302(t, x), \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (t, x\u2032 )] = \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\nand by its Hamiltonian\n\u001b\n\u001a 2\nZ\ng \u2020 \u2020\n~\n\u2020\n\u2020\n3\n\u2207x \u03a8\u0302 \u2207x \u03a8\u0302 + V \u03a8\u0302 \u03a8\u0302 + \u03a8\u0302 \u03a8\u0302 \u03a8\u0302\u03a8\u0302 ,\n\u0124 = d x\n2m\n2\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere m is the atom mass, V the external potential and g the effective coupling. The\nlast two quantities can depend on both t and x. When a significant fraction of the\natoms condense, it is meaningful to expand \u03a8\u0302 in a c-number function \u03a80 , describing the\n\n\f2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n|v|/cH , c/cH )\n\nD\n\n5\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nq\n\n2\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u03bax/cH\n\nFigure 1.

These values are also reported in the\nleft plot. All profiles with \u03baW = \u03baB = \u03ba.\n\ncondensed part, plus a field operator \u03c6\u0302, describing (relative) density perturbations over\nthe condensate\n\u03a8\u0302 = \u03a80 (1 + \u03c6\u0302).\n\n(8)\n\nIn what follows, we consider elongated condensates, which means that the\ntransverse excitations have sufficiently high energies that they are not excited. In this\ncase, \u03a80 and \u03c6\u0302 are effectively one-dimensional fields. For simplicity, we also assume\nthat the condensate is infinitely long, in order to avoid discussing the discreteness of the\nlongitudinal wave number k. The discrete case is indeed more complicated, and treated\nin details in [11]. Finally, we assume that the condensate is stationary, which means\nthat \u03a80 is of the form\np\n\u03a80 (t, x) = e\u2212i\u03bct/~ \u00d7 \u03c10 (x)ei\u03b80 (x) ,\n(9)\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03c10 (x) the mean density of condensed atoms and\n~\n\u2202x \u03b80 (x)\nm\nis their mean velocity.

Theoretical analysis\n3.1. Spectrum of bound modes and quantization\nIn stationary condensates, the spectrum of (18) can be characterized using very general\nproperties. These are first, the fact that the eigenmodes are asymptotically bound\n(to guarantee that they have a well-defined norm since the spatial domain of \u03c6\u0302 is\ninfinite), second, the Hermiticity of (18), i.e. its self-adjointness with respect to the\nscalar product defining the eigen-modes norm, and third, that this scalar product is not\npositive definite, as it is the case here, see (B.15), and for bosonic fields, see e.g. [13].\nWhen these conditions are met, the spectrum of (18) contains a continuous set of\nreal frequency modes labelled by \u03c9 and a discrete index \u03b1, plus, possibly, a discrete and\nfinite set of complex frequency modes that appear in pairs with complex conjugated\nfrequencies. (If the scalar product were positive definite, as is the case for fermions, the\nspectrum of (18) would be purely real.) Throughout this paper, complex frequencies\n\n\f7\nshall be written as \u03bba = \u03c9a + i\u0393a , where a is a positive integer which labels the discrete\nset of pairs, and where \u03c9a and \u0393a are both real and positive. The other cases are reached\nby complex conjugation and/or multiplication by \u22121. The discrete index \u03b1 describes\nthe subset of modes with the same real frequency. As explained below, in one dimension,\nit contains two or four modes depending on whether the flow is subsonic or supersonic.\nAs a result, when propagating in a stationary condensate, \u03c6\u0302, obeying (16) and (17),\ncan always be expanded (see appendix B) as\nZ\nX\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u0302(t, x) = d\u03c9\ne\u2212i\u03c9t \u03c6\u03b1\u03c9 (x)\u00e2\u03b1\u03c9 + e+i\u03c9t (\u03c6\u03b1\u03c9 (x))\u2217 \u00e2\u03b1\u2020\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\n\ni\nXh\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+\ne\u2212i\u03bba t \u03bea (x)b\u0302a + e\u2212i\u03bba t \u03c8a (x)\u0109a + e+i\u03bba t (\u03b7a (x))\u2217 b\u0302\u2020a + e+i\u03bba t (\u03b6a (x))\u2217 \u0109\u2020a ,\n\n(19)\n\na\n\nwhere the modes satisfy the normalization relations\nZ\nh\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndx \u03c10 (\u03c6\u03b1\u03c9 (x))\u2217 \u03c6\u03b1\u03c9\u2032 (x) \u2212 (\u03c6\u03b1\u03c9 (x))\u2217 \u03c6\u03b1\u03c9\u2032 (x) = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 ),\nZ\ndx \u03c10 [(\u03bea (x))\u2217 \u03c8a\u2032 (x) \u2212 (\u03b7a (x))\u2217 \u03b6a\u2032 (x)] = i\u03b4\u03bba \u03bba\u2032 .\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nCorrespondingly, the operators \u00e2, b\u0302, \u0109 satisfy the commutation relations\n\u2032\n\n[\u00e2\u03b1\u03c9 , \u00e2\u03b1\u03c9\u2032 \u2020 ] = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 ),\n\n[b\u0302a , \u0109\u2020a\u2032 ]\n\n= i\u03b4\u03bba \u03bba\u2032 .\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nAll the other scalar products, and all other commutators, vanish. In particular, one\nhas [b\u0302a , b\u0302\u2020a\u2032 ] = [\u0109a , \u0109\u2020a\u2032 ] = 0. Hence b\u0302a and \u0109a are not destruction operators. In fact,\nthe operators b\u0302a and \u0109a form pairs [6] that characterize complex, i.e. with two degrees\nof freedom, harmonic oscillators that are unstable, and for which therefore there is\nR\nno notion of quanta. (Concomitantly, one verifies that the norm dx \u03c10 [|\u03bea |2 \u2212 |\u03b7a |2 ]\nvanishes.) It should be noticed that the eigenfrequencies associated with b\u0302a and \u0109a are\ncomplex conjugated from each other (respectively \u03bba and \u03bb\u2217a ), something guaranteed by\nthe Hermiticity of (18).\nIn terms of the above eigenmodes and operators, (18) reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\nX\n\u03b1\u2020 \u03b1\n\u03b1\n2\n\u0124eff = d\u03c9\n~\u03c9 \u00e2\u03c9 \u00e2\u03c9 \u2212 dx \u03c10 (x)|\u03c6\u03c9 (x)|\n\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\nX \u0014\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2217\n+\ni ~\u03bba b\u0302a \u0109a + dx \u03c10 (x)\u03b6a (x)(\u03b7a (x)) \u2212 h.c. .\n\n(24)\n\na\n\nThe first line contains the usual sum over harmonic oscillators of real frequency and\nthe c-number term accounting for the depletion, while the second line is due to the\ncomplex frequency modes. It should be noticed that the unusual form of the second\nc-number term follows from the unusual scalar product of (21). This Hamiltonian is not\nbounded from below due to the b\u2020a ca terms. Hence the vacuum can no longer be defined\nas the ground state of H, as one might have expected since one is dealing with unstable\noscillators. This gives rise to some ambiguity when choosing the initial 'vacuum' state\n(see section 3.4).\n\n\f8\nEqs.

Firstly, if one can describe the discrete set using\n\u02c6\nthe da operators, there is a price to pay as the associated modes \u03c6a+ , \u03c6a+ , \u03c6a\u2212 , \u03c6a\u2212 are\nnot frequency eigenmodes. Hence their time dependence cannot be factorized. Secondly,\nin usual circumstances, the discrete set of complex frequency modes is empty, as is the\ncase in homogeneous and in near-homogeneous condensates. Nevertheless, when the\ncondensate crosses twice the speed of sound, the discrete set is (generally) nonempty.\nTo explain why, we first need to study the spectrum in homogeneous subsonic and\nsupersonic flows, and then understand how to paste the corresponding modes when the\nflow crosses the speed of sound. When solving this, the dispersive properties of \u03c6\u0302 become\nessential, as we now recall, and as first understood in [4].\n3.2.

For \u03c9 < \u03c9max , one clearly sees that, in supersonic\nflows, two extra (real) roots exist in the left lower quadrant. The most negative one is\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\ncalled, in the text, k\u03c9 and the other one k\u03c9 , so that k\u03c9 < k\u03c9 < 0.\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the frequency in the comoving frame, and where cH is a typical value of the\nsound speed, we take to be that at the horizons, see section 2.1. We also introduced\n2mcH 2\n,\n(30)\n~\nwhich gives the characteristic dispersive scale. When sending \u039b \u2192 \u221e, (29) becomes\nthe relativistic equation \u03a92 = c2 k 2 since the quartic term drops out. Similarly, (28)\nbecomes the Euler equation governing sound waves. Instead, when keeping this term,\nthe dispersion relation (29) possesses four roots, some of which can be complex. As we\nshall progressively see, the two extra roots are at the origin of the laser effect.\n\u039b\u2261\n\n3.2.1. Modes in homogeneous condensates. In subsonic flows, |v| < c, for real \u03bb = \u03c9,\ntwo roots are real, and describe the right and left moving solutions. The other two are\ncomplex, conjugated to each other, and correspond to modes that are asymptotically\ngrowing or decaying, say to left. Only the first two should be used in (19), as the last\ntwo are not asymptotically bound.\nIn supersonic flows, the situation is quite different. For real \u03bb = \u03c9, there exists a\ncritical frequency \u03c9max such that the four roots of (29) are [7]\n\u2022 \u03c9 < \u03c9max : all real;\n\n\u2022 \u03c9 > \u03c9max : two real and two complex ones, as in subsonic flows.\nSee figure 2 for a graphical solution of the dispersion relation (29).\nWhen \u03c9 is real, the normalization of the (bound) modes can be easily worked out,\nas it is, up to a trivial factor, independent of the constant velocity v (because of Galilean\n\n\f10\ninvariance).

To obtain the spectrum in\ncondensates that cross twice the speed of sound, i.e. in flows defining the geometry\nof (2), we need to take into account the nontrivial propagation in the non-homogeneous\nregions localized near the two horizons, and the fact that each subsonic region is now\n\u2021 In terms of the doublets \u0174 defined in appendix B one has\nZ \u03c9max\nZ \u221e\ni\nX h (i) (i)\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(i) (i)\u2020\nv v\u2020\nW\n\u00e2\n+\nW\u0304\n\u00e2\nd\u03c9\n+\nd\u03c9 W\u03c9u \u00e2u\u03c9 + W\u03c9v \u00e2v\u03c9 + W\u0304\u03c9u \u00e2u\u2020\n+\nW\u0304\n\u00e2\n\u0174 =\n\u2212\u03c9 \u2212\u03c9\n\u2212\u03c9 \u2212\u03c9 .\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03c9\n0\n\n0\n\ni=1,2\n\n(36)\n\n\f11\ndefined on the half line and no longer on the full real axis. Then, we need to identify\nthe number of globally defined independent modes.\nIt should be noted that this set does not depend on the particular form of the\nmode equation, but mainly resides on the behaviour in the internal region II and in\nthe asymptotic flat external regions I and III described in section 2.1. Therefore, the\nresult is the same when studying a phonon field in a BEC, as in the present paper, or a\ngeneric scalar field with superluminal dispersion relation as in [6]. As explained in this\nreference, in geometries described by (2), there is a continuous double set (right-going\nand left-going waves) of real frequency modes, and the discrete set of complex frequency\nmodes is generally not empty. Here we give a more mathematical argument yielding the\nsame result.\nIn flows (2), two asymptotically flat and subsonic regions play the most important\nrole in defining the set of modes, for both \u03bb real and \u03bb complex. For \u03bb = \u03c9 real, there\nare three bounded modes: the two usual propagating modes associated with the real\nroots of (29) plus the mode that asymptotically decays. This mode should now be taken\ninto account as it is bound in the subsonic region where it is defined. We will call\ni,III\nthe two sets of three modes \u03c6i,I\n\u03c9 and \u03c6\u03c9 , respectively for the left (I) and right (III)\nasymptotic region, where the superscript i takes three values: u, v, CJ to characterize\nthe asymptotic right-going u-mode, the left-going v-mode and the decaying CJ-mode,\nnamed after the paper of Corley and Jacobson [14]. In the internal region II, we have\nfour modes that we call \u03c6j,II\n\u03c9 with j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Since this region is bound, the four roots\nof (29) should be taken into account.\nTherefore, any globally defined solution of frequency \u03c9 can be expanded in two\nforms by referring to its left, or right, asymptotic behaviour:\nX\n\u03c6\u03c9 =\nLi\u03c9 \u03c6i,I\n\u03c9 ,\ni\n\n\u03c6\u03c9 =\n\nX\n\nR\u03c9i \u03c6i,III\n\u03c9 .\n\n(38)\n\ni\n\ni,III\nMoreover, each partial wave \u03c6i,I\ncan be written in term of the \u03c6j,II\n\u03c9 or \u03c6\u03c9\n\u03c9 :\nX\nj,II\nLij\n\u03c6i,I\n\u03c9 \u03c6\u03c9 ,\n\u03c9 =\nj\n\n\u03c6i,III\n\u03c9\n\n=\n\nX\nj\n\nj,II\nRij\n\u03c9 \u03c6\u03c9 .\n\nPutting together the above equations, one obtains\nX\nX\ni\ni\nR\n=\nLij\nRij\n\u03c9 L\u03c9 .\n\u03c9 \u03c9\ni\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\ni\n\nThis system of four equations in six unknowns (the coefficients R\u03c9i and Li\u03c9 ) has a twodimensional set of solutions, corresponding to two linearly independent modes. For\ninstance, one can choose as independent solutions, \u03c6u,in\nand \u03c6v,in\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 , the two right-going\nand left-going in-modes, defined as the solution of (40) with respectively Lu = 1, Rv = 0\nand Lu = 0, Rv = 1. Similarly, one can chose the out-modes \u03c6u,out\nand \u03c6v,out\ndefined\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\n\f12\nrespectively by Lv = 0, Ru = 1 and Lv = 1, Ru = 0. Using the scalar product of (20) to\nnormalize these modes, the two sets are related by [6]\n\u03c6u,in\n= T\u03c9 \u03c6u,out\n+ R\u03c9 \u03c6v,out\n,\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c6v,in\n= T\u0303\u03c9 \u03c6v,out\n+ R\u0303\u03c9 \u03c6u,out\n.\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\n(41)\n\nUnitarity imposes |T\u03c9 |2 + |R\u03c9 |2 = 1 = |T\u0303\u03c9 |2 + |R\u0303\u03c9 |2 , and R\u03c9 T\u0303\u03c9\u2217 + T\u03c9 R\u0303\u03c9\u2217 = 0.\nLet us now move to the complex frequency case. Because all expressions are analytic\nin \u03bb, the above analysis applies as such when replacing \u03c9 by \u03bb = \u03c9 + i\u0393. The novel\naspects only come through the condition that the modes be asymptotically bound.\nIndeed, \u0393 > 0 implies that k\u03bbu , the asymptotic wave number of the u real root of (29)\n(more precisely of its analytical continuation in \u0393), acquires a positive imaginary part.\nThus the mode diverges at x \u2192 \u2212\u221e, unless one puts Lu = 0. Similarly, on the right\nside, the v mode diverges at x \u2192 +\u221e, and imposing that it is bound requires Rv = 0.\nHowever, these two conditions imply that the system (40) has only the trivial solution\nRi = Li = 0, except when its determinant vanishes. This condition defines an equation\nfor the complex frequency \u03bb that has a finite set of solutions: {\u03bba , a = 1, 2, ..., N}.\n3.3. The semi-classical treatment of [6]\nHaving established the condition that defines the complex frequencies \u03bba , we now turn\nto the question of calculating them. Since the above algebraic method does not depend\non the specific form of the mode equation, the semi-classical treatment of [6] applies\nto the present case. Therefore, we just summarize the results without going into the\ndetails. One should nevertheless pay attention to the fact that one is dealing with modes\ndoublets (\u03c6, \u03c6) and to the normalization of these modes.\nWhen the background is not homogeneous but v varies slowly with respect to the\nwavelength of the perturbation, the exact solutions are well approximated by their WKB\napproximation, which can be directly inferred from (35)\nr\n\u0002 Rx\n\u0003\nexp i dx\u2032 k\u03c9\u03b1 (x\u2032 )\n1\n\u2202k\u03c9\u03b1 (x)\n\u03b1\nq\np\n,\n\u03c6\u03c9 (x) =\n\u2202\u03c9\n2\u03c0\u03c10 (x)\n1 \u2212 Dk2\u03c9\u03b1 (x)\nr\n(42)\n\u0002 Rx \u2032 \u03b1 \u2032 \u0003\n\u03b1 (x)\n\u03b1 (x)\nexp\ni\ndx\nk\n(x\n)\nD\n\u2202k\nk\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nq\np\n\u03c6\u03b1\u03c9 (x) =\n.\n\u2202\u03c9\n2\u03c0\u03c10 (x)\n1 \u2212 D 2\u03b1\nk\u03c9 (x)\n\nThe x-dependent wave numbers k\u03c9\u03b1 (x) are real roots of the dispersion relation (29) in a\nstationary inhomogeneous flow characterized by v(x) and c(x):\n\n~2 k 4\n.\n(43)\n4m2\nIgnoring the quartic term, one obtains the dispersion relation of a massless field\npropagating in the acoustic metric (1). Equations are valid in the three regions I,\nII, III but not close to the horizons where the gradients of v and c cannot be neglected.\nThe theoretical analysis can then be greatly simplified when taking into account\nthe fact that the mixing between u and v modes is usually negligible [7, 15]. (However\n(\u03c9 \u2212 v(x)k)2 = c(x)2 k 2 +\n\n\f13\nthe numerical analysis of the next section does not rely on this simplifying assumption.)\nIn this approximation, the laser effect is completely due to the u-modes (for flows to\nthe left v < 0). Considering the u in-mode in the internal region II, it can be written\nas a superposition of three WKB waves:\n(1) \u2217\n\n(i)\n\n(2) \u2217\n\n\u03c6u,in\n= A\u03c9 \u03c6u\u03c9 + B\u03c9(1) \u03c6\u2212\u03c9 + B\u03c9(2) \u03c6\u2212\u03c9 ,\n\u03c9\n\n(44)\n\nS = U4 U3 U2 U1 ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2212\u03c9 are the two negative frequency \u03c6u -modes, corresponding to the two extra\n(i)\n(1)\nroots k\u03c9 , k\u03c9 being the most negative one, see figure 2.\nIn [16] it was shown that the propagation from one horizon to the other is efficiently\ndescribed by a unitary scattering of a two-component vector, whose first component\nrepresents the u-wave \u03c6u\u03c9 and the other represents the trapped wave, described either\n(1)\n(2)\nby (\u03c6\u2212\u03c9 )\u2217 or (\u03c6\u2212\u03c9 )\u2217 .

Even though these equations have been\nobtained through a semi-classical reasoning, their validity goes beyond that of the\nWKB approximation, as shall be established by the remarkable agreement between\nthe relations one can derive from them and the numerical results.\nThe main prediction concerns the relation between \u03bba , solutions of (52), and the\nbehaviour of the coefficients of (50). Indeed, \u03bba solution of S22 = 1, is a pole of\n(2)\nB\u03c9 = b\u03c9 = S21 /(1 \u2212 S22 ). Therefore, when \u0393a is small enough (this is always true\n(2)\nin our numerical situations), the pole is close to the real axis and the behaviour of B\u03c9\nfor real frequencies \u03c9 is dominated by the contribution of the pole:\nS21\ni\u0393a\nB\u03c9(2) =\n\u2248\u2212\n(53)\nB\u03c9(2)a ,\n1 \u2212 S22\n\u03c9 \u2212 (\u03c9a + i\u0393a )\nfrom which\n\u03932a\n(2) 2\n|B\u03c9(2)a |2 .\n(54)\n|B\u03c9 | \u2248\n2\n2\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9a ) + \u0393a\n(2)\n\nThus, |B\u03c9 |2 should be well described by a sum of Lorentzians characterized by the\n(2)\ncomplex frequencies \u03bba . In figure 3 we plot |B\u03c9 |2 obtained from numerical simulations\nand the corresponding fitted sum of Lorentzians. The agreement is excellent.\nWe conclude this analysis by showing that a semi-classical treatment furnishes\napproximate expressions for the complex frequencies \u03bba . Assuming |z\u03c9 |2 , |w\u03c92 | and\n|z\u03c9 w\u03c9 | are much smaller than 1, one can expand the condition S22 = 1 in powers of\nthese quantities.

Observables: Phonon fluxes and density\u2013density correlation patterns\nHaving identified the set of eigenmodes, we now consider observable quantities. We\nshall study both the phonon flux emitted by the black-hole\u2013white-hole system, and the\nnon-local density\u2013density correlation pattern, as they illustrate very different aspects of\nthe laser effect.\nIn what follows, we work in quantum settings because we shall assume that the\nstate at the formation of the supersonic region is vacuum. In classical settings, the\ndynamical instability (the laser effect) would be present only if the initial densityperturbation possesses a non-vanishing overlap with some complex frequency mode,\nsee section V.A. in [6]. For a perfectly adiabatic formation of the supersonic flow, the\n\n\f16\namplitudes associated with these modes would be zero. However, any small deviation\nfrom adiabaticity will trigger the instability, thereby engendering a behaviour very\nsimilar to that derived in quantum settings. In fact, as we shall see, the main difference\nbetween the quantum and the classical treatment is at early times because in the\nquantum vacuum all complex frequency modes contribute to the observables through\nthe spontaneous excitation.\nTo compute observables, we first need to choose the quantum state. Because of the\ninstability, the energy (24) is unbounded from below, and there is no clear definition\nof the vacuum. Nevertheless, if the formation of the supersonic region at time t0 = 0\nis adiabatic, and if the temperature condensate is low enough, i.e. much smaller than\n\u03ba, the Heisenberg state of the system can be approximated by the state annihilated, at\nthat initial time, by the destruction operators \u00e2\u03b1\u03c9 , d\u02c6a+ , d\u02c6a\u2212 of (25).\u00a7 Since the operators\nd\u02c6a+ , d\u02c6a\u2212 are not stationary, the expectation values will not be stationary either, and\nwill instead depend on the lapse of time since the formation at t0 = 0. In what follows\nall expectation values will be computed in this state.\nThe two observables we shall study are related to the density fluctuation \u03c1\u03021 = \u03c1\u0302\u2212\u03c10 .\nGiven the definition of \u03c6\u0302 in (8), \u03c1\u03021 is given by\n\u03c1\u03021 = \u03c10 (\u03c6\u0302 + \u03c6\u0302\u2020 ) = \u03c10 \u03c7\u0302,\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u0302 \u2261 \u03c6\u0302 + \u03c6\u0302\u2020 is Hermitian.

Since these\nare only elastically scattered, see (41), they stay in their ground state and contribute\nneither to the emitted fluxes nor to the pattern of density\u2013density correlations. The third\nline contains a mixed contribution of the growing \u03c3a (x) and decaying modes \u03bda (x). It\ndoes not contribute to the fluxes at any time because \u03c3a (x) vanishes in region I, and\n\u03bda (x) does it in III, see the paragraph after (41). Moreover, since it only depends on t\u2212t\u2032 ,\nit does not significantly contribute to the correlation pattern at late time. Therefore,\nboth fluxes and correlation patterns are governed by the growing mode contribution,\nthe first term of the second line in \u03c3a (x)(\u03c3a (x\u2032 ))\u2217 .\nIt is clear that at late times, i.e. t \u2212 t0 > 1/max(\u0393a ), all observables are dominated\nby the mode with the largest \u0393a . For instance, the equal time density\u2013density correlation\nfunction is asymptotically given by\nh0|\u03c1\u03021 (t, x)\u03c1\u03021 (t, x\u2032 )|0i \u223c \u03c10 (x)\u03c10 (x\u2032 ) \u00d7 e2\u0393a t Re [\u03c3a (x)(\u03c3a (x\u2032 ))\u2217 ] .\n\n(67)\n\nThe real part of the frequency \u03c9a drops out and, as a result, the locus of the maxima\ndoes not propagate with time. This function is studied for various modes in section 4.4.\nIn case the initial state is not vacuum but a thermal state, the above two-point function\nwould be multiplied by 2na +1, where na is the mean occupation number, which depends\nin a nontrivial way both on the temperature and on the blue shift effect due to the\nhorizons (see equation (46) in [7]). Similar considerations apply to the quantity that\nis considered below. Had we worked in classical settings, we would have obtained a\ncoherent wave whose behaviour in x and t is the same as that of h0|\u03c1\u03021 (t, x)\u03c1\u03021 (t\u2032 , x\u2032 )|0i\nat fixed x\u2032 , t\u2032 , see equation (54) in [6]. The main difference arises from the fact that the\nclassical wave amplitude is fixed by initial conditions.\nIt is also interesting to study the onset of the instability for earlier time, i.e.\nt \u2212 t0 < 1/max(\u0393a ). To this end, we consider the following quantity:\nZ T\nZ T\n\u2032\n\u2032\nPbh\u2212wh (\u03c9, T ) \u2261\ndt e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t ) h0|\u03c7\u0302(t, x) \u03c7\u0302(t\u2032 , x)|0i,\ndt\n0\n\n0\n\n4| sin[(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9a \u2212 i\u0393a )T /2]|2\n.\n(68)\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9a )2 + (\u0393a )2\nIt governs the probability that a density fluctuation of frequency \u03c9 be observed during\nthe interval [0, T ] at some fixed location x in the subsonic region III, see [6].\nWhen \u0393a \u2192 0, when the discrete set labeled a becomes continuous, and when T\nis sufficiently large, Pbh\u2212wh (\u03c9, T ) behaves as in the Golden Rule: Pbh\u2212wh (\u03c9, T ) \u221d T n\u0304\u03c9 ,\n\u223c \u03a3a e\u0393a T |\u03c3a (x)|2\n\n\f18\ni.e. the lapse of time T times n\u0304\u03c9 , the mean occupation number of frequency \u03c9. There\ncan be pre-factors that depend on the strength of the coupling, the amplitude of the\nmode \u03c6\u03c9 at x, if one deals with a derivative coupling.\nIt is more interesting to study Pbh\u2212wh (\u03c9, T ) as a function of T for a given blackhole\u2013white-hole geometry, and to compare it with Pbh (\u03c9, T ), the corresponding quantity\ncomputed in the case where only the black hole horizon would be present. When\nT \u00d7 max(\u0393a ) \u226a 1, the two observables behave in a very similar manner, even when\nonly a few (say 10) complex frequency modes exist in the black-hole\u2013white-hole case.\nThis shall be seen by a numerical analysis in section 4.3, but can be also understood\nfrom the properties of the growing modes \u03c3a (x), see the central paragraph of section\nV.B.5 in [6].\nFor classical settings, the laser effect is present only when the initial densityperturbation profile is characterized by a non-vanishing amplitude of some complex\nfrequency mode. Since for adiabatic formation of the horizons all the amplitudes\nassociated with those modes are zero, no laser effect appears in this case. However,\neven a small deviation from perfect adiabaticity causes the presence of instabilities.\nThe main difference in the quantum framework is therefore the possibility to make the\nsystem unstable through the spontaneous excitation of complex frequency modes.\n4. Numerical results\n4.1. The method\nIn a few words, we describe how we proceeded to solve numerically (27) in the flows\ndescribed by (2) and (4). As in the case of a single black hole or white hole horizon,\nwhen working with a fixed frequency, the main task is to avoid the growing mode\ncontaminating the oscillatory modes. The way to get rid of this difficulty is by\nintegrating from the subsonic region towards the horizon into the supersonic region\nwhere there is no growing mode [14].\nBasically we solved separately the mode equation from region I to region II, and\nfrom region III to region II, using a code adapted from [7]. In each case, as in\nthat reference, we integrated the equations for initial conditions describing the three\nacceptable modes in regions I and III: the right-moving u-mode, the left-moving v-mode\nand the decaying mode. Then for each of them we computed the amplitudes of the four\noscillatory modes in the supersonic region II. The two globally defined modes are built\nusing the procedure described in section 3.2.2. To obtain the scattering from I to III,\nwe eliminated the amplitudes in region II.\nTo obtain the correlation patterns of figures 11\u201313 we solved the mode equation\nwith the corresponding complex frequency \u03bba that we had formerly computed.\n\n\f19\n4.2. The discrete set of complex frequencies\nTwo strategies can be used to determine the complex frequencies \u03bba = \u03c9a +i\u0393a , solutions\nof (52). They can be obtained either by solving directly the linear system (40), or by\n(2)\ndetermining the center and the width of the Lorentzians in |B\u03c9 |2 of (54). We use the\nlatter to localize them and the former to refine the results and study how they depend\non the various parameters of the system.\n(2)\nTo give a first idea, in figure 3 we represent |B\u03c9 |2 as a function of \u03c9/\u03c9max (green\npoints) for two different values of L, the distance between the horizons. A sum of\nLorentzians functions (red line) is fitted to the data obtained from the numerical analysis\n(see (54)). The quality of the fit confirms the correctness of the theoretical analysis\nof section 3.3 and of [6]. In the following sections, we study the dependence of \u03bba\non both the parameters describing the geometry (see the velocity profile (2)) and the\ndispersive scale \u039b of (29). The dependence on n is not reported here, since it induces\nno significant change.k Before proceeding we make some comment about the properties\nand the validity of the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld condition (55).\n4.2.1. The validity of the semi-classical approximation. The action appearing in (55)\n(2)\n(1)\ncontains the difference of two wave vectors: k\u03c9 \u2212 k\u03c9 . These have the same sign\n(negative for positive \u03c9), as they belong to the same u-branch of the dispersion relation\n(1)\n(see figure 2), but they have opposite group velocity: k\u03c9 describes a right-going mode\n(2)\nwith respect to the lab, whereas k\u03c9 a left-moving one. This peculiarity give rise to\nan unusual phenomenon. In the usual case, eigenmodes with small (large) frequency\ncorrespond to small (large) Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld numbers nBS , i.e to modes with few\n(many) nodes. In the present case instead, a large nBS corresponds to low frequency\nmodes and vice versa. This can be understood from (55). Because the wave vectors\n(1)\n(2)\nappeared subtracted, a small nBS implies k\u03c9 close to k\u03c9 and this happens for \u03c9 close\nto \u03c9max (see figure 2). On the contrary, a large nBS implies a large difference between\n(1)\n(2)\nk\u03c9 and k\u03c9 , that is, \u03c9 close to 0.\nThis has an unusual consequence. The Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld condition is more reliable\nwhen the action is large, that is for nBS \u226b 1. In the present case this happens for small\n\u03c9/\u03c9max. On the other hand the WKB approximation is expected to fail for small \u03c9, as\ncan be verified by the fact that f of (56) cannot be neglected when \u03c9/\u03ba \u2264 1. Both these\nexpectations are confirmed in figure 4 where we compare the numerical results with the\npredictions obtained with the standard WKB approximation (green lines) and with the\nimproved method (red lines), that is when using (56). Firstly, the agreement between\nthe Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld condition and the numerical results is worse for \u03c9 close to \u03c9max\nand gets better when nBS increases. Secondly, at low frequency, while the quality of the\nk The role of n of (2) is to govern the smoothness of the transition from the near-horizon region to the\nflat asymptotic ones. A smaller n corresponds to smoother transition, while a larger n corresponds to\nsteeper transition and, consequently, to a larger almost-flat region between the horizons. The usefulness\nof n is essentially technical: it allows one to control the numerical analysis when L, the distance between\nthe horizons, is comparable to D, the width of the transition between regions I\u2013III of section 2.1.\n\n\f20\n2.0\n\n(2)\n\n|B\u03c9 |2\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\ng replacements\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9max\n(2)\n\nFigure 4. |B\u03c9 |2 as a function of \u03c9/\u03c9max for \u03baW = \u03baB = \u03ba, q = 0.5, D = 0.5, n = 2,\nL\u03ba/cH = 10, \u039b/\u03ba = 8, \u03c9max /\u03ba \u2248 1.408.

In figure 5,\nleft panel, we plot \u03c9a = Re(\u03bba ) for the entire spectrum of complex frequency modes as a\nfunction of the half-distance between the horizons L, all other quantities being fixed. On\nthe right panel, \u0393a = Im(\u03bba ) is plotted as a function of L, for nBS =4 and for the same\nvalues of the other parameters. As conjectured in [6], when L grows, all \u03c9a (L) values\nincrease, and when there is enough 'room', a new eigenmode appears with \u03c9a \u223c 0. As\na result, the eigenfrequencies become denser close to \u03c9max , because they neither cross it\nnor disappear.\nIt is interesting to consider more closely the birth of new modes near \u03c9 = 0. A\nrather difficult question to answer is the following: when extra mode appear, does\nthe imaginary part of the frequency \u0393a vanish, as found in figure 1 of [18], or not?\nThis question is physically relevant in that it governs the continuous character of the\nstability of the system: if \u0393a vanishes, it implies that the birth of new modes leads to a\ncontinuous behaviour in L (as one can expect on the general ground that the properties\nof the eigenmodes, solutions of (13), continuously depend on the parameters appearing\nin that equation). From figure 5, which is based on the roots of the determinant in (40),\nno definite conclusion can be drawn since there is a loss of numerical precision for\n(2)\n\u03c9 \u2192 0. A more reliable method consists in studying the behaviour of |B\u03c9 |2 on\nthe real frequency axis.

The broad peak of figure 3 near\n\u03c9/\u03c9max = 0.05 cannot be reproduced with this method because of numerical errors.\nFor similar reasons, each curve \u03c9a (L) ends for low \u03c9. Right panel: \u0393a /\u03ba for nBS = 4\nas a function of L for the same fixed parameters.

From this it is quite\nclear that when a new eigenmode appears, both the real part and the imaginary part\nof \u03bba vanish, as was also found in the appendix of [19].\nAnother important feature confirming the theoretical analysis of section 3.3 is the\npresence of superposed oscillations on the overall trend of \u03c9a . In fact, the latter is given\nby the solution of the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld equation (55), whereas the oscillations are due\nto the deviations governed by the sine in \u03b4\u03c9a of (58). For the imaginary part instead,\nthere is no zeroth-order contribution, and the dominant contribution to the right plot\nof figure 5 is given in (57).\n4.2.3. Asymmetric velocity profiles. Using asymmetric velocity profiles, namely\ndifferent surface gravities \u03baW and \u03baB , does not lead to substantial modifications of\nthe spectrum. The only observable change concerns \u0393a . When \u03baW = \u03baB , \u0393a vanishes\nfor some particular combination of parameters, as can be seen in figure 5, right panel.\nEquation (57) can indeed be rewritten as\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u03b8a\n2\n2\n\u2217\n\u0393a =\n,\n(69)\n(|z\u03c9a | \u2212 |w\u03c9a |) + 4|z\u03c9a w\u03c9a | cos\n2T\u03c9a\n2\nwhich shows that when |z\u03c9a | = |w\u03c9a |, \u0393a vanishes when the cosine does, and this is\nbecause the scatterings at the black and the white horizons destructively interfere with\neach other. When the two surface gravities are different, (|z\u03c9a | \u2212 |w\u03c9a |)2 is non-zero\nand \u0393a can no longer vanish (see figure 6).

The u\u2013v mixing and the parameter q. The mixing between the u-modes, which\nare right-going in the lab in subsonic flows, and the v-modes is controlled by the\ntransmission coefficient T\u03c9 of (41). In figure 7, |T\u03c9 |2 is plotted as a function of q\nfor a fixed frequency \u03c9/\u03ba = 0.100. The transmission coefficient is almost 1 between\nq = 0.25 and q = 0.75. Thus, for values of q in this range the u\u2013v mixing is negligible,\nas was noticed in [7] for a single black (or white) hole. In this regime the approximation\ndiscussed in section 3.3 is valid. There is, however, an important difference with respect\nto the single black hole case. In black-hole\u2013white-hole geometries, the transmission\ncoefficient deviates from zero when approaching a resonance. When working with a\nfixed \u03c9, we found two sharp spikes figure 7 for q = 0.1248 and q = 0.56023 which\nexactly correspond to two unstable modes. Moreover, the width of the spikes is almost\nequal to the corresponding \u0393a . We also looked for complex eigenfrequency associated\nwith the other two local and broad minima of |T |2 , at q = 0.3363 and q = 0.6285, and\nwe found two eigenmodes with respectively \u03c9a /\u03ba = 0.090 and \u03c9a /\u03ba = 0.103, i.e. in\nthe neighbourhood of the chosen frequency \u03c9/\u03ba = 0.100. These considerations show\nthat close to resonances one cannot completely neglect the u\u2013v mixing. Nevertheless, as\nshown in figure 4, the improved treatment of the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld equation produces\nvery good estimates for the values of the real part \u03c9a of the complex frequencies.\n\n\f23\n1.00\n\n0.95\n\n|T |2\n\n0.90\n\n0.85\n\n0.80\n\n0.75\n\nPSfrag replacements\n0.70\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nq\nFigure 7.

The role of the maximal frequency \u03c9max . In [7, 15], it was shown that the\ndeviations, due to dispersion and w.r.t. the standard Planckian distribution, of the\nspectrum emitted by a single BH, or WH, are mainly governed by \u03c9max . However, the\nlatter depends both on the UV scale \u039b and the velocity profile (see section 3.2.2). The\nrelationship takes the form\n\u03c9max = \u039bf (D, q).\n\n(71)\n\nHence the same value of \u03c9max can be reached from very different cases, and yet it was\nfound that the fluxes are hardly sensitive to this. In the present case however, this\ninsensitivity is lost because the number of resonances directly depends on \u039b. This can\n(2)\nbe understood by studying (55), and is manifest in figure 8, where |B\u03c9 |2 is plotted as\na function of \u03c9/\u03ba for two different values of \u039b.\n4.3. Growth of the asymptotic phonon fluxes\nIn figure 9, we represent the relevant quantities that govern the properties of the\n'probability' function introduced in (68). On the left upper plot, we present the growth\nrates \u0393a and the corresponding times T\u03c9ba of (60) for the 13 complex frequency modes that\nexist in the condensate flow of figure 3, lower plot. On the right upper plot, we show the\nGolden Rule transition rate associated with (68) in that black-hole\u2013white-hole geometry\n(dots), and the rate one would obtain if the white hole were not present. In that case,\nthe quantity plotted is proportional to \u03c9 \u00d7 n\u0304\u03c9 , where n\u0304\u03c9 is the mean occupation number\nin the black hole geometry as computed in [7]. It is given by n\u0304\u03c9 = |w\u03c9 |2 /(1 \u2212 |w\u03c9 |2 ),\nsee U3 of (46), where |w\u03c9 |2 is well approximated by\n|w\u03c9 |2 = e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba (1 \u2212 \u03c9/\u03c9max )1/2 .\n\n(72)\n\n\f24\n20\n\n(2)\n\n|B\u03c9 |2\n\n15\n\n10\n\ng replacements\n\n5\n\nL\u03baB /cH\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9max\n(2)\n\nFigure 8. |B\u03c9 |2 as a function of \u03c9/\u03c9max for different values of D and \u039b giving rise\nto the same \u03c9max /\u03ba = 0.19: black solid line for D = 0.33, \u039b/\u03ba = 2, and red dashed\nline for D = 0.7, \u039b/\u03ba = 0.695.

Lower panels: P (\u03c9, T ) of (68) as a function of \u03c9/\u03c9max for\nan isolated black hole (solid line) and for a black-hole\u2013white-hole pair (dashed line),\nrespectively at time T = 30\u03ba\u22121 (left plot) and T = 200\u03ba\u22121 (right plot).\n\n\f25\nThe pre-factor of \u03c9 is due to the normalization of the \u03c7 modes of (63). In a black-hole\u2013\nwhite-hole, the quantity that corresponds to \u03c9 \u00d7 n\u0304\u03c9 is \u03c9a \u00d7 2\u0393a T\u03c9ba . In both cases, these\nquantities vanish for \u03c9 > \u03c9max .\nIn the lower plots, we show (68), at two different times, and for both the blackhole\u2013white-hole, and the isolated black hole flows. As expected, the exponential growth\nof the laser effect does not show up for times T smaller than the inverse of the maximal\n\u0393a (here T \u223c 110/\u03ba). Moreover, the discreteness of the spectrum is not visible either\nat early times. To be resolved, it requires times larger than 2\u03c0\u2206\u03c9a , where \u2206\u03c9a is the\nfrequency gap between neighboring Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld frequencies \u03c9a . It is here of the\norder of \u2206\u03c9a \u223c \u03c9max /10 \u223c 0.02\u03ba.\nOn the contrary, for times of the order of 1/max(\u0393a ) or greater, both the exponential\ngrowth of the laser effect and the discreteness of the spectrum show up. These allow\none to distinguish the phonon flux emitted by the black-hole\u2013white-hole pair from that\nemitted by the sole black hole that grows linearly in T for all values of \u03c9. This linear\ngrowth can be observed by comparing the continuous lines of the right upper and lower\nplots, and constitutes a numerical validation of the Golden Rule!\n4.4. Spatial properties of complex frequency modes and correlation patterns\nThe density\u2013density correlation function can be calculated following the procedure\ndescribed in section 3.4. As outlined there, only the largest-\u0393a mode significantly\ncontributes to the pattern at late time. Nevertheless, to appreciate the variety of cases,\nit is worth studying the modes and the corresponding correlation patterns also for lower\n\u0393.\nAs a typical example of a mode with a large \u0393, we consider the fourth BS mode in\na configuration with fivecomplex eigenfrequencies. In figure 10 (upper panel) the real\npart of this mode is represented, while the supplementary movie laser 1.gif (available\nfrom stacks.iop.org/NJP/12/095015/mmedia) gives its evolution in time. As a second\nexample, we choose a very different situation with q = 0.7 and a dispersion relation\nwith higher \u039b. In this case, the spectrum of complex frequencies is large. In figure 10\ntwo modes are plotted: one with nBS = 14 and a moderate value of \u0393 (central panel),\nand one with nBS = 2 and a very small value of \u0393 (lower panel). When comparing the\nmodes and their correlation patterns, some features remain the same, whereas others\nsignificantly differ.\nIn the first example, since \u0393 is high, the laser effect is strong as can be seen from the\nmovie: in the right asymptotic region there is an exponentially growing right-going flux.\nThis growth in time can also be inferred from the spatial decrease of the mode amplitude\non the right of the black hole, because these are linearly related, see equation (54) of\n[6]. Considering the correlation pattern of this mode in figure 11, one sees that the\ndominant signals come from the inside region (the central square of size \u223c 22) where\nthe amplitude of the mode is highest, and from the horizontal and vertical bands which\ndescribe the correlations between the escaping flux and the trapped mode.\n\n\f26\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n\u03bea (x)\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nx\u03ba/cH\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n\u03bea (x)\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n\n-0.02\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.06\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nx\u03ba/cH\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u03bea (x)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n-2\n\n-3\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nx\u03ba/cH\nFigure 10.

Density\u2013density correlation function (67) divided by e2\u0393a t of the mode\nwith a high \u0393 represented in the upper plot of figure 10 with x in units of cH /\u03ba. We have\ndivided the expression by e2\u0393a t in order to suppress the dependence on time. Since the\ncorrelations bewteen different regions have very different amplitudes, we were obliged\nto use different scales to reveal them. The central square from \u221211 till 11 is the trapped\nregion. It contains the strongest correlations since the mode amplitude is highest in\nit. The two (symmetrical) bands of width \u223c 22 in the right upper plot describe the\ncorrelations between the trapped region and the external region on the right of the\nblack hole, while the other two bands describe those with the left external region. The\ncorrelations in the lower left panel are those on the left of the white hole. They are\nmuch weaker and of greater wave length, in agreement with the mode properties on\nthe left side of the upper plot of figure 10.\n\n\f28\n\nFigure 12. Density\u2013density correlation function (67) divided by e2\u0393a t for the mode\nwith a moderate \u0393 represented in the central plot of figure 10. Similarities with the\nformer figure are manifest, and concern both the spatial properties of the pattern and\nthe amplitudes of the correlations. The main difference concerns the high-frequency\nmodulations of the inside\u2013inside and inside\u2013outside correlations which are due to the\nfast oscillations of the mode amplitude in the trapped region, which are visible in the\ncentral plot of figure 10, and which are due to fact that nBS is high: nBS = 14.\n\nFrom the mode itself and from its correlation pattern in figure 11, one can see\nthat the u\u2013v mixing is very low, as expected from the choice of q = 0.5. The leftgoing mode coming out of the white hole is about 2.5 orders of magnitudes smaller\nthan the right-going one that comes out of the black hole, as can be seen from the\nratio of amplitudes between the top left part and top right part in figure 11. To\nunderstand how the modes propagate, it is appropriate to consider the top left part.\nThis region represents the correlations between u (right-going) and v (left-going) modes.\n\n\f29\n\nFigure 13. Density\u2013density correlation function (67) divided by e2\u0393a t for the mode\nwith a low \u0393 represented in the lowest panel of figure 10. The bottom legend\ncorresponds to the central region of the plot. One clearly sees the two nodes in the\ntrapped region. One also finds them in the inside\u2013outside correlations, both on the left\nand on the right of the trapped region. Finally, one notices that in the present case\nthe u \u2212 u correlations on the right upper square are weaker than the v \u2212 v correlations\non the lower left panel. This follows from the high u\u2013v coupling between the trapped\nmode, which is a u-mode, and the outside v-mode.\n\nThe slope of the highest/lowest correlation lines gives the ratio between the velocities\nof the two modes. When the modes form a continuous set, the two velocities are the\ngroup velocities. However, in the present case, when considering a single mode, the\nslope of these lines corresponds instead to the ratio between the phase velocities of uand v-modes. Similarly, the pattern in the top right part are simply due to the nodes\nof the right moving mode evaluated at a given time, see equation (61) in [6].\nWe now consider the correlation pattern of figure 12, corresponding to a mode\n\n\f30\nwith a moderate value of \u0393 and nBS very large. The overall properties of the pattern\nare basically the same as those of figure 11. The main differences come from the high\nwave-vector content of the trapped mode, which produces short distance features in the\ncentral square and in the bands. Outside these regions the patterns are very similar.\nIn the last pattern of figure 13, corresponding to a mode with a very small value\nof \u0393 and nBS = 2, we get a different picture. The pattern is basically concentrated in\nthe central square since the amplitude of the mode outside is related to its amplitude\ninside by the square root of \u0393, as can be seen from (57). In the present case, the u\u2013v\nmixing is so high that the pattern on the left of the white hole is higher (by a factor of\nabout 5) than on the right of the black hole. One also notices that in the central panel\n(nBS = 2) there is only one node. Moreover, the beat-like shape shows that this wave is\nthe result of the superposition of two waves with very similar and relatively high wave\nvectors.\n4.5. The Technion experiment\nRecently a black-hole\u2013white-hole flow has been experimentally realized [3]. Our\nnumerical code can describe this configuration, up to some limitation. In fact, the\nvelocity profile (figure 3(b) of [3]) is rather irregular while our code works accurately\nonly for velocity profiles as in figure 1, right panel, with an almost-flat internal region.\nNevertheless, we shall proceed in order to obtain at least an estimation on the number of\nthe unstable modes and their growing rate. As far as we know, this is the first estimate\nof this quantity, which is very relevant from an experimental standpoint.\nThe main parameters of the experimental setting are\ncH = 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 m/s,\n\n\u03baB = \u03baW /2 = \u03ba = 213.7 s\u22121 ,\n\nv(x = 0) = \u22123.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 m/s = \u22124.9 cH ,\n\nc(x = 0) = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 m/s = 0.48 cH ,\n\nc(x \u2192 \u221e) = 8 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22124\n\nm/s = 1.1 cH ,\n\n(73)\n(74)\n\n2L = 10\u22125 m = 1.5 cH /\u03ba,\n\u039b/\u03ba = 6.\nTo reproduce the above setting we perform two simulations with fixed D = 1.\n(2)\nIn figure 14, |B\u03c9 |2 is plotted as a function of \u03c9/\u03c9max for q = 0.9 (left panel) and\nq = 0.48 (right panel). These two values are obtained by using, respectively, c(x = 0)\nand c(x \u2192 \u221e) equal to their experimental values in (73) and (74).\u00b6 The small distance\nbetween the two horizon implies that few trapped modes are present in this situation.\nThe values of \u0393a and \u03c9a of the complex eigenfrequencies are reported in both cases\nin table 1. The dominant contribution comes from the eigenfrequency with the largest\n\u00b6 We used these two values because, in our analysis, it is not possible to fix independently c(x = 0)\nand c(x \u2192 \u221e). We expect that the actual value of the complex frequencies would lie in between the\ntwo sets we obtain.\n\n\f12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n|B\u03c9 |2\n\n(2)\n\n14\n\n(2)\n\n14\n\n|B\u03c9 |2\n\n31\n\n8\n6\n\nSfrag replacements\n\n6\n\n4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n2\n0\n\n8\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9max\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9max\n\n(2)\n\nFigure 14. |B\u03c9 |2 as a function of \u03c9/\u03c9max for q = 0.9, \u03c9max /\u03ba \u2248 3.4 (left panel) and\nq = 0.48, \u03c9max /\u03ba \u2248 2.7 (right panel).

In the two cases this corresponds to an instability time scale, respectively \u03c4 \u2248 0.06 s\nand \u03c4 \u2248 0.02 s. Even if the two simulations are generated with very different values\nof q, the two results agree in order of magnitude. Note that the estimated instability\ntime scale is more than twice the time scale for which the horizons are maintained in\nthe experimental configuration (\u2248 0.008 s). In order to see the laser effect, it would be\nneeded to maintain the systems for a longer time, or to increase \u03ba by a factor of 10,\nwithout changing the adimensional parameters of the system such as the ratio L\u03ba/cH .\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we analysed the spectrum of phonons in a BEC when the stationary\nflow of the condensate crosses twice the speed of sound. Our analysis is based on\nthe Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equation (13). Hence, even though the analogy with light\npropagation in a pair of black and white horizons is manifest, none of our results rely\non this gravitational analogy.\nIn the limit where the condensate can be considered as infinite, i.e. when no periodic\nboundary condition is introduced, the spectrum of bound modes contains real frequency\nmodes that are only elastically scattered, see (41), plus a discrete and finite set of pairs\n\n\f32\nof complex frequency modes (19). These modes can be seen as the resonances of the\ncavity bordered by the two sonic horizons. They lead to dynamical instabilities because\nthe scattering through each sonic horizon is anomalous, in that it mixes positive and\nnegative norm modes, see (44). Then, using semi-classical techniques, we compute the\nreal and the imaginary part of the complex frequencies. The real part \u03c9a obeys a\nBohr\u2013Sommerfeld condition that introduces the discreteness of the spectrum, whereas\nthe imaginary part \u0393a is related to the norm of the scattering coefficients across the\nhorizons, see (57). In the case of toroidal geometry, the analysis would instead be\ncomplicated by the discreteness of the wave vectors. The instability appears only when\none \u03c9a approximately matches one of the frequencies associated with that discrete set\nof wave vectors. This explains the presence of the instability bands found in [10, 11].\nIn section 4, we numerically solved the Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equation for real\nand complex frequencies. By comparing the numerical properties with those derived\nusing the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld and (44), we validated the use of semi-classical methods,\nsee figures 3\u20135. In section 4.3 we numerically studied the growth of number of phonons\nemitted by the black-hole\u2013white-hole system. In spite of the discrete character of the\ntrapped modes, at early time, this quantity behaves very similarly to the flux that\nthe black hole horizon would emit in the absence of the white hole horizon. Instead,\nfor larger time both the instability and the discreteness show up. Finally, we studied\nthe equal time correlation pattern of density\u2013density fluctuations associated with three\ndifferent complex frequency modes, respectively with high, moderate and low value of the\nimaginary part \u0393a . In all cases, the instability shows up most clearly in the supersonic\nregion where the amplitude of the trapped mode is the highest one. The correlations\nbetween the trapped mode and the emitted modes display very specific properties, see\nfigure 11 and then next two ones.\nFinally, we studied (within some limitations) the experimental situation realized in\nJune 2009 in the Technion [3]. The results are summarized in figure 14 and show that\nfew unstable modes are found, and that the instability time scale is about ten times\nlarger than the life time of the condensate. This means that an increase by a factor of\nten of the surface gravity (without changing the adimensional parameters of the system\nsuch as the ratio L\u03ba/cH ) would lead to comparable time scales. The laser effect could\nthen be observable.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank J Macher for providing the code used in [7] and for\nexplanations about it.

The quantization procedure\nTo understand how to expand the complex field operator \u03c6\u0302 in modes and\ncreation/destruction operators, it is convenient to define a two-component field [16]\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c6\u0302\n\u0174 \u2261\n.\n(B.9)\n\u03c6\u0302\u2020\n\nThen (13) becomes\n\ni~\u2202t \u0174 = B \u0174 ,\n\n(B.10)\n\nB = (T\u03c1 + g\u03c10 )\u03c33 \u2212 iv\u2202x + ig\u03c10 \u03c32 ,\n\n(B.11)\n\nwhere \u03c3i are the Pauli matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\n0 \u2212i\n\u03c31 =\n, \u03c32 =\n,\n1 0\ni 0\n\n\u03c33 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(B.12)\n\nSince the field \u0174 is invariant under the conjugation operation defined by\nS\u0304 \u2261 \u03c31 S \u2020 ,\n\n(B.13)\n\n\f34\nthe structure of \u0174 must be\nX\n\u0174 =\n(Wn \u00e2n + W\u0304n \u00e2\u2020n ),\n\n(B.14)\n\nn\n\nP\nwhere Wn are doublets of C-functions, and n denotes the summation over a (possibly\ncontinuous) complete sets of modes.\nUsing \u2202xT = \u2212\u2202x , T\u03c1T = T\u03c1 and the properties of Pauli matrices, one verifies that\nthe scalar product\nZ\nhW1 |W2 i \u2261 dx \u03c10 (x) W1\u2217 (t, x)\u03c33 W2 (t, x)\n(B.15)\nis conserved under time evolution when Wi are solution of (B.10), since\nB \u2217T \u03c33 = \u03c33 B.\n\n(B.16)\n\nFor later convenience, we state here some properties of the scalar product that can\nbe verified using the anticommutation relation of Pauli matrices and (16):\nhW1 |W2 i = hW2 |W1 i\u2217 ,\n\n(B.17)\n\u2217\n\nhW\u03041 |W\u03042 i = \u2212hW2 |W1 i = \u2212hW1 |W2 i ,\n1\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )i\u03c32 ,\n\u0174 \u0174 T \u2212 (\u0174 \u0174 T )T =\n\u03c10 (x)\n\n(B.18)\n\n[hW1 |\u0174 i, hW2 |\u0174 i] = \u2212hW1 |W\u03042 i = hW2 |W\u03041 i.\n\n(B.20)\n\n(B.19)\n\nAssuming that the Wn have a non-zero norm, we define an orthonormal basis:\nhWn |Wm i = \u2212 hW\u0304n |W\u0304m i = \u03b4nm ,\n\n(B.21)\n\nhWn |W\u0304m i = 0,\n\n(B.22)\n\nwhere the Kronecker \u03b4 is replaced by a \u03b4-distribution in the case of a continuous set of\nmodes. Using (B.14) and the above identities, one obtains\n[\u00e2n , \u00e2\u2020m ] = [hWn |\u0174 i, \u2212hW\u0304m |\u0174 i] = hWn |Wm i = \u03b4nm ,\n\n(B.23)\n\nBW\u03bb\u03b1 = ~\u03bbW\u03bb\u03b1 .\n\n(B.24)\n\nwhich shows that \u00e2n and \u00e2\u2020n are in fact destruction and creation operators.\nWhen the condensate is stationary, one can work with eigenmodes W\u03bb\u03b1 of frequency\n\u03bb, where the index \u03b1 describes the set of modes with the same frequency. By definition,\none has\n\nThe conservation of the scalar product gives\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n0 = \u2202t hW\u03bb\u03b1 |W\u03bb\u03b1\u2032 i = \u2212i(\u03bb\u2217 \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 )hW\u03bb\u03b1|W\u03bb\u03b1\u2032 i.\n\n(B.25)\n\nFrom this it is clear that only real frequency modes can be normalized as in (B.21).\nHowever, in the presence of dynamical instabilities, complex frequency eigenmodes are\npresent. We shall assume that these modes form a discrete and finite set of pairs of\nmodes with conjugated frequencies that we call {\u03bba = \u03c9a + i\u0393a , a = 1, 2, ...N}. In place\nof (B.21), we choose the following pseudo-normalization for each pair,\nhW\u03bba |W\u03bb\u2217a\u2032 i = i\u03b4aa\u2032 ,\n\n(B.26)\n\n\f35\nand the other scalar product must vanish because of (B.25). In fact, the Hermiticity of\n\u0124 implies that if \u03bba is an eigenfrequency, then \u03bb\u2217a is an eigenfrequency too [16]. We call\nV\u03bba and Z\u03bba the doublets corresponding to \u03bba and \u03bb\u2217a , respectively.\nSummarizing, the field \u0174 can be expanded as\nZ\ni\nX\u0002\n\u0003 Xh\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u0174 = d\u03c9\nW\u03c9\u03b1 \u00e2\u03b1\u03c9 + W\u0304\u03c9\u03b1 \u00e2\u03b1\u2020\n+\nV\nb\u0302\n+\nZ\n\u0109\n+\nV\u0304\nb\u0302\n+\nZ\u0304\n\u0109\na a\na a\na a\na a , (B.27)\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\n\na\n\nwhere all \u03bba have a positive imaginary part \u0393a .\nnormalization rules,\n\u2032\n\nThe modes satisfy the following\n\n\u2032\n\nhW\u03c9\u03b1 |W\u03c9\u03b1\u2032 i = \u2212 hW\u0304\u03c9\u03b1|W\u0304\u03c9\u03b1\u2032 i = \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )\u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 ,\n\nhVa |Za\u2032 i\n\n(B.28)\n\n= hV\u0304a |Z\u0304a\u2032 i = \u2212hZa\u2032 |Va i = \u2212hZ\u0304a\u2032 |V\u0304a i = i\u03b4aa\u2032 ,\n\n(B.29)\n\nand all the other scalar product vanish.
