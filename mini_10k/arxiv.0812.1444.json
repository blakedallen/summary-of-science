In 2004, Ohtomo and Hwang discovered that an electron gas can be also\nrealized at the interface between large gap insulators made of transition metal oxides [1]. This finding has\ngenerated considerable efforts to clarify the underlying microscopic mechanism. Of particular interest is the\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 system, because it features especially striking properties. High carrier mobility [1], electric\nfield tuneable superconductivity [2] and magnetic effects [3], have been found. Here we show that an orbital\nreconstruction is underlying the generation of the electron gas at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 n-type interface. Our\nresults are based on extensive investigations of the electronic properties and of the orbital structure of the\ninterface using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. In particular we find that the degeneracy of the Ti 3d states\nis fully removed, and that the Ti 3dxy levels become the first available states for conducting electrons.\n\n1\n\n\fInterfaces between transition metal oxides can exhibit electronic properties that are absent in the\nindividual layers. A prominent example is the electronic conduction at the TiO2/LaO n-type\ninterfaces\n\nin\n\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO)\n\n[1]-[3],\n\nLaTiO3/SrTiO3\n\n(LTO/STO)\n\n[4]\n\nand\n\nLaVO3/SrTiO3 (LVO/STO) [5] bilayers composed by excellent insulators. These heterostructures\nare believed to avoid electronic instabilities at their interfaces by an \"electronic reconstruction\"\nmechanism that is expected to occur in addition to the classical structural reconstructions.\nConsequently, the properties of transition metal oxide interfaces are thought to be sensitively\ncontrolled by polar discontinuities, band-bending, epitaxial strain and related phenomena [6].\nThe LVO/STO and LAO/STO bilayers only generate a conducting interface if the\nthicknesses of the LVO and LAO films reach a critical value, which are 5 [2] and 4 unit cells (uc)\n[7] respectively. This behaviour is consistent with the \"polarization catastrophe\" mechanism, which\nattributes the induction of mobile charges at the interface to the large electrostatic energy of thick\nLVO or LAO layers. This energy increases with the film thickness [3, 8], and it is composed of a\nCoulomb energy term and of the elastic energy of the crystal lattices, which is controlled by the\nfinite lattice mismatch. Therefore, modifications of both structural and electronic properties of the\nLaAlO3 and SrTiO3 layers in the LAO/STO system may be induced at the interface, raising the\nquestion, whether the formation of an electron gas at the interface is simply a result of the induction\nof charge carriers or whether it is associated with further changes of the electronic or lattice\nstructure of the oxide layers.\nTo resolve this problem, we have applied X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) as a probe of\nthe interface electronic states of the LAO/STO system. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is able of\nidentifying the unoccupied density of states of buried interfaces with chemical and orbital\nsensitivity. It has recently been used with great success to shed light on the interfaces electronic\nstates in manganite/cuprate bilayers [9].\nThe XAS measurements have been performed at the ID08 beamline of the European\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility. XAS spectra were collected at the Ti-L2,3 absorption edge of\nn-doped interfaces in LAO/STO heterostructures grown by pulsed laser deposition. The spectra\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1 X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy on STO and LTO crystals: (a) a sketch of the XAS process\nfor 2p\u21923d transitions.

The\ndata present the total electron yield in arbitrary units. The red, continuous line presents the result of the\natomic multiplet simulation for STO using the Missing package software [11].\n\nwere measured as a function of the thickness of the LAO films. Details concerning the method of\npreparation, structural, transport and morphological properties of these samples can be found in [2][3]. In particular, the analyzed samples were grown at the University of Augsburg at an oxygen\npressure of 8x10-5 mbar and at the University of Twente at an oxygen pressure of 2x10-3 mbar. The\nformer show low temperature superconductivity [2], for the latter ones magnetic effects were\nreported [3]. The LAO/STO films were oxygenated in-situ at an oxygen pressure of ~0.5 bar. By\nusing scanning probe microscopy this procedure has been demonstrated to create a conductive layer\nonly at the interface [10].\nIn X-ray absorption, photons excite core electrons to the unoccupied states of the solid. In\nSrTiO3, the first available unoccupied states are the empty 3d levels of the Ti4+ ions [Fig.1a]. All the\nfeatures of the measured L2,3 Ti-edge spectra agree with the results of atomic multiplet calculations,\nwhich were performed using the \"Missing\" scientific package [11] [Fig. 1b]. The first two main\nspectral peaks, a1 and b1, are attributed to 2p3/2\u2192 3d transitions and have contribution from\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 2 X-ray absorption spectrum measured at an n-type LAO/STO interface in comparison to\nthe calculated spectra of a single LaxSr1-xTiO3-d monolayer: the experimental results (black circles)\nare obtained on a 4 uc LAO/STO bilayer, the lines show the calculated spectra of STO covered by one\nmonolayer of LaxSr1-xTiO3-d with x=1 (red), x=0.2 (blue) and x=0.1 (black).\n\neg (dxz, dyz, dxy) and t2g (dz2, dx2-y2) levels respectively. Here, the z-direction refers to the surface\nnormal. The XAS spectra are strongly sensitive to the valence of the Ti ions [12]. Indeed, data taken\non LaTiO3, the Ti-sublattice of which comprises Ti3+ only, differ considerably from those taken on\nSTO [Fig. 1b]. Moreover, the XAS process is strongly influenced by the splitting of the 3d levels\nand therefore provides information on the crystal field. In fact, by using linearly polarized light, it is\npossible to select an in-plane (dxy, dx2-y2) or an out-of-plane (dxz, dyz, and dz2) orbital as final state.\nThe linear dichroism, obtained by subtracting XAS spectra with out-of-plane (Ic) and in-plane\npolarization (Iab), is particularly sensitive to any distortion of the TiO6 octahedra and therefore\nprovides valuable information on the eventual presence of orbital reconstructions.\nBulk sensitive fluorescence yield and interface sensitive total electron yield XAS acquisition\nmodes were used simultaneously. Fluorescence Yield (FY) XAS spectra of LAO/STO interfaces,\ncomposed of 2 uc , 4 uc, 8 uc and 12 uc LAO layers, of insulating STO crystals and of conducting\nNb-doped (1% at.) STO crystals, are very similar. Moreover, as function of the polarization the data\ndo not show any appreciable difference. The Total Electron Yield (TEY) XAS spectra, however,\nturns out to vary among the samples and depend significantly on the polarization. The differences\n\n4\n\n\fbetween FY and TEY data are related to the different sampling depths of the two techniques. For\nthe soft x-ray energies used (<500 eV), the sampling depth in the FY mode is several tens of nm,\nwhile in the TEY mode it is between 1.5 and 3.0 nm [13]. Thus, the TEY mode is mainly probing\nthe final STO interface layers. Therefore, the differences of the two data-sets provide clear evidence\nthat the electronic states at the interfaces of the LAO/STO bilayer differ from the bulk states.\nThese measurements reveal, moreover, that the interface electronic states are not associated\nwith a formation of a LaxSr1-xTiO3-d solid solution. Fig. 2 compares data measured at a conducting\nLAO/STO sample (4 uc) with calculated spectra of a hypothetical complete interface layer of\nLaxSr1-xTiO3-d. The latter are obtained by appropriately combining the measured TEY of LaTiO3\nand SrTiO3 crystals. Fig. 2 reveals that a complete LaTiO3 or LaxSr1-xTiO3-d layers (x>0.1) are\nunable to match the experimental results, in agreement with previous electron energy loss\nspectroscopy measurements [2].\nTEY XAS spectra of LAO/STO heterostructures measured as function of the number of\nLAO layers provide key information on the electronic properties of the interface. First, with\nincreasing LAO thickness, the main peaks, in particular the peak b1 of the Iab and Ic spectra, shift to\nhigher energies and their position saturates above 4 uc [Fig. 3a]. A second key result comes from\nthe measurements of the linear dichroism, i.e. the differences among the TEY XAS signals taken\nwith the two polarizations [Fig. 3b]. A marked change in the linear dichroism is found as function\nof the LAO thickness. This result has to be associated to a change of the anisotropy in the 3d\nelectronic states and in particular to a variation of the splitting between the in-plane and out-ofplane t2g and eg states. In a perfectly symmetric Ti4+ system, as in cubic STO with undistorted TiO6\noctahedra, the absolute dichroism needs to disappear. Dichroism can be generated by a deviation\nfrom the cubic symmetry, for example by a tetragonal distortion, which causes an energy splitting\nof the t2g and eg states. The energy splitting can be obtained by treating it as a fit-parameter in fitting\nthe calculated spectra to the Iab and Ic XAS data and to the corresponding dichroism. Remarkably,\nSTO and metallic Nb-doped STO reference samples show a dichroism opposite to the one of the\nLAO/STO interface [Fig. 3b]. In the case of STO and Nb-doped STO, the experimental results are\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3 TEY X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy on LAO/STO interface: (a) TEY Ti L23 edge spectra\nwith E//c polarization and (b) linear dichroism acquired at 300 K on STO (red line), Nb-STO (green line)\nand LAO/STO as function of the LAO thickness (black lines, Augsburg samples grown at 8x10-5 mbar,\nblue lines Twente 4 uc sample grown at 2x10-3 mbar). The inset of (a) shows that with increasing LAO\nthickness the peak b1 shifts to higher energies. In (b) the calculated dependence of the linear dichroisms\nreproducing the data on conducting LAO/STO (upper curve) and on bare STO (lower curve) are shown as\nred lines. (c) Comparison between Iab (black) and Ic (red) experimental TEY spectra on 4 uc LAO/STO\n(open circles) and calculated ones for a bilayer (continuos lines).\n\n(d) the integral of the absolute\n\n-5\n\ndichroism (open circles: Augsburg samples deposited at 8x10 mbar; filled red circle: Twente sample\ngrown at 2x10-3 mbar; filled grey circle is the data on Nb-doped STO) and the position of the b1 peaks\nfrom the Iab (filled diamonds) and Ic (filled squares) spectra as function of the number of LaAlO3 layers.\n\nwell reproduced by a positive energy splitting of about 20 meV between the dxy and the (dxz, dyz)\norbitals, and of 40 meV between the dx2-y2 and dz2 states. These values correspond to an elongation\nof the TiO6 octahedra along the surface normal [14]. After depositing a few unit cells of LaAlO3 on\n\n6\n\n\fsuch a surface, however, the dichroism changes sign [Fig. 3b]. Now the in-plane dxy, and dx2-y2\norbitals have a smaller energy than the out-of-plane (dxz, dyz) and dz2 orbitals. The energy\ndifferences amount to ~50 meV and 100 meV, respectively. The splitting of the energy levels, and\nthe shift of the a1 and b1 peaks, occur already in the insulating 2 uc sample, but become much more\npronounced if the LAO thickness exceeds the critical value of d \u00a5 4 uc for the interface to become\nconducting.\nThe details of the XAS spectra are also well reproduced by using the parameters obtained\nfrom the splitting of the levels as determined from the dichroism data. It is noted that not only the\nenergy shift between Ic and Iab spectra, but also the shape of the XAS signal in the region between\nthe a1 and the b1 peaks can be accounted for [Fig. 3c]. Finally, the integral of the absolute\ndichroism, \uf0f2L2,3 I c \uf02d I ab dE , and the position of the b1 peaks from the Iab and Ic spectra also show a\nsudden change as function of the number of LaAlO3 layers, in particular between 2 and 4 uc, i.e.\nwhen the interface becomes conducting [Fig. 3d].\nWe conclude that for LAO thicknesses close to the conductance threshold a pronounced\nanisotropy of the 3d energy levels is induced. This behaviour is correlated with the formation of the\n2D electron gas and therefore reveals that an orbital reconstruction occurs when mobile carriers\nappear at the interface. The orbital reconstruction is robust and, between 300 K and 9 K, almost\ntemperature independent. Moreover, the reconstruction is extremely similar in samples grown in\ndifferent oxygen conditions. These results are consistent with signatures of electronic\nreconstructions that have recently been reported for LAO/STO superlattices investigated by\nresonant x-ray scattering [15].\nIt is remarkable that the splitting of the 3d levels at the LAO/STO interface is opposite to the\ncase of TiO2 terminated STO and Nb-STO. If a pure Jahn-Teller distortion was assumed, the data\nwould indicate that at the LAO/STO interface the TiO6 octahedra are compressed along the\ninterface normal. This behaviour would, however, be conflicting with structural data, which suggest\nan out-of-plane relaxation of STO close to the interface [16]-[18]. Such a relaxation is expected\nsince the La3+ ion produce a large, repulsive Coulomb field on the Ti ion, pushing the latter toward\n\n7\n\n\fthe STO bulk, while the oxygen in the octahedra are moved toward the LAO. Our data, therefore,\nsuggest that the orbital distortion cannot be a pure Jahn-Teller one. Describing the generation of the\nelectron gas at the LaTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, Okamoto et al. have proposed a ferroelectric-like\ndistortion of the TiO6 [19]. Their calculation also shows that this kind of structural relaxation could\nprovide an orbital ferro-distorsive ordering of the 3dxy Ti states, becoming the lowest empty levels\nfor conducting electrons. Similar conclusion are reported in [20] for the same system and in [21] for\nthe LaAlO3/SrTiO3 superlattice. On the other hand, recent LDA and LDA+U [22] calculations on\nthe LaAlO3/SrTiO3 predict an antiferro-distorsive ordering as found in GdFeO3. In this case the\nconducting electrons would have only partially a 3dxy character, which would be conflicting with\nthe experimental data that reveal the 3dxy orbital to be the first available state.\nThe calculations performed on superlattices predict an electronic reconstruction and a\nconducting interface also for one unit cell LAO thin layer, a result experimentally verified in\nLAO/STO multilayers [23]. However, the situation of a bilayer differs considerably due to the\nproximity of the interface to the LaAlO3 surface. Thus the dipole field inside the LaAlO3 can be\npartially accommodated by relaxation and consequent polar distortion of the lanthanum and oxygen\nions [24]. Consequently, until a critical thickness threshold, the polar distortion in the LaAlO3 can\ncompensate partially the electrostatic energy. Above the threshold this mechanism is no more\nefficient and an orbital reconstruction takes place. Our data demonstrate that an orbital\nreconstruction indeed occurs in the bilayers only above the threshold. In particular, interface sidebands with 3dxy character appear, to which carriers are transferred to lower the electrostatic energy.\nThis is consistent with the ferro-distorsive ordering of the TiO6 orbital predicted for LaTiO3/SrTiO3\nand LaAlO3/SrTiO3 superlattice [19]-[21].\nIn conclusion, X-ray absorption spectra of LAO/STO bilayers reveal that the generation of\nthe 2D electron gas at the interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 is not related to an oxygendefective or cation-substituted (La/Sr) STO surface layer. The data show that the formation of the\nconducting electron gas is associated with an orbital reconstruction occurring at the interface, which\n\n8\n\n\fcauses a splitting of the 3d Ti states and the lowering of the 3dxy levels so that these become the first\nempty Ti states for conducting electrons.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge support from the EU under the project Nanoxide, contract n. 033191.

The linearly polarized x-rays were impinged onto the surface at an\nincident angle of \uf071=70\u00b0 from the surface normal. Using the vertical (V) polarization of the light,\ndipole selection rules allows transition to final states in the plane of the sample while, in the\nhorizontal (H) polarization, the electric field of the radiation is mainly parallel to the surface\nnormal. A further correction is applied to the spectra having H polarization, in order to get only the\nE//c component, Ic, using the well known formula IH(\uf071)=Iabcos2(\uf071)+Ic sin2(\uf071). IH(\uf071) is the spectra\ntaken at the angle theta with H polarization and Iab is the spectra taken with the same geometry\nusing V polarization. No background subtraction is needed using this procedure. We have acquired\nfor each sample and temperature consecutive spectra with H, V, V and H polarization and averaged\nthem to eliminate any systematic errors.\nThe simulated XAS spectra have been calculated using the MISSING package [11], based on the\nCowan's code (www.esrf.eu), for a Ti4+ ion (3d0) in Oh and D4h point symmetry. The optimized\nparameters were: 10Dq=2.19 eV, Slater integrals rescaled to 61% of their Hartree-Fock values,\n\n9\n\n\fLorentzian of final states variable from 120 meV to 850 meV (HWHM) for increasing final state\nenergy.\nThe spectra of LaxSr1-xTiO3-d (1uc)/SrTiO3 of Fig. 2 are determined by combining the experimental\nSrTiO3 and LaTiO3 data. In particular we used the following formula, valid for the TEY of a\nbilayer, which takes into account the sampling depth, d=3nm:\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nI \uf03d xI \uf0a5LTO 1 \uf02d e \uf02d1 / d (uc ) \uf02b (1 \uf02d x)e \uf02d1 / d (uc ) I \uf0a5STO\n\nwhere I \uf0a5STO is the bulk spectra of STO, and I \uf0a5LTO is the bulk spectra of LTO.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Ohtomo, A. and Hwang, H.

There is no measured\nestimate available for SrTiO3, but in TiO2 a value of 3 nm is reported in case of secondary electrons\ngenerated by hard x-rays. (T. Iyasu et al., Appl. Surf. Science 252, 4335\u20134339 (2006)).
