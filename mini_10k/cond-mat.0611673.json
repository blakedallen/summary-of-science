We present the results obtained on the magnetisation relaxation\nproperties of an XX quantum chain in a transverse magnetic field. We first consider\nan initial thermal kink-like state where half of the chain is initially thermalized at a\nvery high temperature Tb while the remaining half, called the system, is put at a lower\ntemperature Ts . From this initial state, we derive analytically the Green function\nassociated to the dynamical behaviour of the transverse magnetisation. Depending\non the strength of the magnetic field and on the temperature of the system, different\nregimes are obtained for the magnetic relaxation. In particular, with an initial dropletlike state, that is a cold subsystem of finite size in contact at both ends with an\ninfinite temperature environnement, we derive analytically the behaviour of the timedependent system magnetisation.\n\n1. Introduction\nNon-equilibrium properties of quantum chains generated by initial inhomogeneities,\nor by the sudden variation of an external field have been the purpose of several\nextended studies starting from the sixties and continuing up to nowadays. In particular,\nin the context of free-fermionic models, that is Ising-like chains [1, 2], since the\ndynamics can be solved exactly [3, 4], a lot of exact results have been obtained.\nOne may mention magnetisation relaxation profiles which show a scaling behaviour\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2], two-point correlation functions characterising ageing\nproperties [10, 11], magnetisation and energy current densities [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and\none may notice that a quantized relaxation behaviour was also observed[19, 20, 21]. Since\nthe very first studies of Niemejer and Tjion and others [22, 23, 24, 25], the relaxation\nobtained shows typically a very slow decay. Indeed, they have shown that the relaxation\nof the magnetisation in a spin-free fermionic chain after a sudden change of the external\nmagnetic field is algebraic instead of exponential [26] and that there is a lack of ergodicity\nin the sense that the magnetisation does not relaxe toward its equilibrium value [24].\nConsequently, in such systems there is no finite relaxation time. Moreover, it was shown\nthat for certain inhomogeneously magnetised initial states, at special wave vectors, a\nslowing down of the magnetisation relaxation can occur for gapped free fermionic models\n\u2021 Corresponding author: karevski@lpm.u-nancy.fr\n\n\fRelaxation in the XX quantum chain\n\n2\n\n[9]. The effect of quenched disorder was also considered in the Ising quantum chain [27].\nOnce more, for an initially completely ordered state, either in the field direction or\nperpendicular to it, an algebraic decay of the magnetisation toward a stationary state\nwas obtained. More recently, in the critical Ising quantum chain we have studied the\nrelaxation of an initially magnetised finite droplet at a given temperature in contact\nat both ends with infinite Ising chains. We have shown that the droplet magnetisation\ndecays in time to the equilibrium magnetisation with a 1/tf (x/t) behaviour [20] where\nf (u) is a scaling function depending on the temperature. For a vanishing droplet initial\ntemperature, the scaling function is simply given by the characteristic function \u03a0(u).\nIn the present study, we focus our attention to the same situation in the XX\nquantum chain in a transverse magnetic field. Whereas in the Ising case, the transverse\nmagnetisation is not conserved in time, in the XX quantum chain it is a conserved\ndynamical quantity and one may expect that this conservation law will show up in\na way or an other in the relaxation behaviour. To be more specific, let us precise\nthe initial set-up. The system is initially prepared in a factorized canonical state\n\u03c1(0) = \u03c1b (0)\u03c1s (0) where the density matrices \u03c1b,s (0) \u221d e\u2212\u03b2b,s Hb,s are canonical states\n\u22121\nof parts of the (infinite) chain each thermalized at a given temperature \u03b2b,s\n. At time\nt = 0, the (local) interactions between the different parts are switched on and the\ndynamics is generated by the total Hamiltonian H = Hb + Hs + HI . The paper is\norganised as follows: In the next section we give some details of the by now classical\ndiagonalisation of the XX-model and its dynamics. Section 3 gives more details on\nthe initial set-up and on the time-dependent expectation values of physical quantities,\nputting a special focus on the transverse magnetisation. In particular, it is shown that\nthe time-dependent transverse magnetisation may be expressed as a discret convolution\nproduct of a Green function with the initial magnetisation profile. In section 4, from\nan initial kink-like state we derive analytically the magnetisation Green function and\nshow that, at vanishing system temperature, one has to distinguish between the low\nand high field regimes. Consequently, in section 5, we show that the relaxation of the\nmagnetisation of an initial finite droplet of size Ls , toward its equilibrium vanishing\nvalue, changes after an initial linear decay from an algebraic decay, Ls /t, at large fields\nto a faster size-independent decay at lower fields. However, this behaviour does not\nsurvive for finite system temperatures, but nevertheless the magnetisation relaxation\nat low enough temperatures is strongly affected. We finally summarize our results and\ndraw out some conclusions.\n\n\f3\n\nRelaxation in the XX quantum chain\n2. Diagonalisation and Dynamics\n2.1.

At \u03ba = 0, Jx = Jy and the Hamiltonian describes the XX-model for which\nP\nthe total transverse magnetisation M z = n \u03c3nz is a conserved quantity since we have\n[H, M z ] = 0.

Since the time-contractions are\nexplicitely known one needs only to compute the initial state properties of the string\noperators for a given \u03c1(0).\nIn this work we focus our attention on the time behaviour of the transverse\nmagnetisation which is, as already stated, a conserved quantity. The transverse\nmagnetisation is one of the simplest Clifford string operator. Namely, it takes the\nform \u03c3nz = \u2212i\u03932n \u03931n and at time t, in the Heisenberg picture we have\n\u03c3nz (t) = \u2212i\u03932n (t)\u03931n (t) .\n\nIts expectation value, in the thermodynamic limit, at time t is given by\nX j\nFt (n, k)Ik,k+j\nh\u03c3nz i(t) =\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nk,j\n\nwhere Ik,k+j = T r{\u2212i\u03932k \u03931k+j \u03c1(0)} is the initial condition matrix. The time-dependent\nfunctions Ftj are given by\nFtj (n, k) = h\u03931k |\u03931n (t)ih\u03932k+j |\u03932n (t)i \u2212 h\u03931k |\u03932n (t)ih\u03932k+j |\u03931n (t)i .\n\n(27)\n\nand they can be explicitely evaluated in the thermodynamic limit:\nFt2j (n, k) = Ft2j (n \u2212 k) = (\u22121)j Jn\u2212k (t)Jn\u2212k\u22122|j|(t) ,\n\n(28)\n\nand they identically vanish for odd j. Consequently, we have for the time behaviour of\nthe transverse magnetisation\n\u221e\nX\n\u0001\nz\nh\u03c3n i(t) =\nFt2j \u22c6 P 2j (n) ,\n(29)\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u22c6 stands for a discret convolution product and where we introduced the notations\nP 2j (k) = Ik,k+2j .\nOne needs now to evaluate the initial matrix I. First remark that for Clifford\noperators \u0393 belonging to different initial blocks, the trace identically vanishes, reflecting\nthe fact that they are traceless operators and that there are no initial correlation between\nthem since the initial state is of a product form. So, the only non-vanishing contribution\n\n\f7\n\nRelaxation in the XX quantum chain\n\ncomes whenever the two-\u0393s are in the same sub-system.

The total droplet magnetisation density\nP\nmz (t) = L1s k\u2208Ls mz (k, t) will relaxe toward zero since the baths are at infinite\ntemperature (and consequently have a vanishing transverse magnetisation). From the\nasymptotic Green function obtained in the different regimes h \u2265 1 and h < 1 we obtain\ntwo different relaxation behaviours.\n5.1.

The vanishing of the magnetisation at\ntimes t \u2265 \u03c42 is a direct consequence of the vanishing of the Green function in the region\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212 1 \u2212 h2 < x/t < 1 \u2212 h2 . However, this exact cancellation is valid only in the limit\nLs \u2192 \u221e. For a finite droplet, one has finite size corrections to the Green function such\nthat at the leading order the Green function is given by Gt (x) = g(x/t)/t[1 + O(1/Ls )].\nThese corrections lead for the magnetisation density to a size independant correction to\nzero of order 1/t. Consequently, the ratio between the magnetization densities at h < 1\nand h \u2265 1 is asymptotically (in time) given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nmzh<1 (t)\n1\n.\n(56)\n=O\nz\nmh\u22651 (t)\nLs\nIt is in this sense that the magnetisation density within the droplet changes from a slow\nrelaxation (53), depending on the size of the system, to a much faster relaxation since\nit is independent of the size. If one considers the total remaining magnetisation of the\ndroplet, we pass from a diffusive like behaviour L2s /t at h \u2265 1 to a balistic-like behaviour\nLs /t at h < 1. These two regimes reflect the fact that the dispersion relation changes\nfrom a parabolic shape, \u01eb(k) \u223c h \u2212 1 + k 2 /2 at h \u2265 1 to a linear regime \u01eb(k) \u223c |k \u2212 kF |\nfor h < 1.\nOn figure (3) we show the numerical results compared to the analytical expressions\nobtained for the droplet magnetisation density. The agreement between the exact\nnumerical results and the analytical asymptotic expressions is excellent.\n\n\fRelaxation in the XX quantum chain\n\n13\n\n5.2.

In the h < 1 region,\nthe faster relaxation is recovered in the low temperature limit \u03b2s \u2192 \u221e. Indeed, for\nsufficiently small temperature the magnetisation density is given by\nLs\nexp (\u2212\u03b2s (1 \u2212 h))\n(58)\nmz (t) \u2243\n\u03c0t\nand one may identify a typical size-dependent inverse temperature \u03b2(Ls ) \u2261 ln Ls /(1\u2212h)\nand one recovers the fast relaxation for inverse temperatures \u03b2s \u226b \u03b2(Ls ).\n6. Summary and discussion\nWe have presented here analytical results, confirmed by exact numerical calculations, of\nthe relaxation of the transverse magnetisation of the XX quantum chain. In particular,\nstarting from an initial product state depending on the strength of the initial magnetic\nfield, we have obtained the asymptotic Green function associated to the transverse\nmagnetisation. When the system is divided initially into two parts, a hot bath and\na cold sub-system, we have shown that the Green function takes the scaling form\nGt (x) = 1t g(x/t), where the explicit shape of the scaling function g(u) depends on\nthe initial temperatures and on the field. In the extreme scenario, with a vanishing subsystem temperature and an infinite bath temperature, at low fields, h < 1, the scaling\nfunction shows the very peculiarity that its support is disconnected. This property leads\nto the emergence of a flat magnetization profile when one starts with a kink-like initial\nprofile [16]. In the case of an initial finite magnetised domain it leads to the fact that its\nrelaxation is much faster in the low field regime, h < 1 than it is at higher fields. Namely,\none has mh<1 (t)/mh\u22651 (t) \u223c 1/Ls where m(t) is the domain magnetisation density at\ntime t and where Ls is the size of the domain.\nFinally, one may notice that for a Green function taking the scaling form Gt (x) =\n1\ng(x/t), one has identically\nt\nx\n\u2202t G + \u2202x G = 0\n(59)\nt\nso that the impulsional response magnetisation mzi = mz (0)Gt decays in time and satisfy\nthe continuity equation\n\u2202t mzi (x, t) + \u2202x ji (x, t) = 0\n\n(60)\n\nwith the current ji simply given by ji (x, t) = xt mzi (x, t). In the step-like situation, the\nscaling form 1t g(x/t) of the Green function leads to a scaling solution mzs (x, t) = \u03a6(x/t)\nwhich obviously satisfy the homogeneous scaling equation\n(t\u2202t + x\u2202x )mzs (x, t) = 0\n\n(61)\n\n\f14\n\nRelaxation in the XX quantum chain\n\nwhich leads for the current js to the equation \u2202x js = xt \u2202x mzs . So that the step-like\ncurrent is related to the impulsional current through \u2202x j s = j i since \u2202x mzs = mzi .\nAcknowledgements\nWe want to thank the Groupe de Physique Statistique of the Laboratoire de Physique des\nMat\u00e9riaux for usefull and pleasant discussions.
