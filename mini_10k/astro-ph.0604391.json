We\nshowed that the slope of this relation is rather insensitive to the exact details\nof the star formation history and chemical enrichment of the stellar population (except for recent star bursts) and to dust reddening, owing to the well-\n\n\f2\nknown age/metallicity/dust degeneracy. Furthermore, the color\u2013M/L slope is\nalso rather insensitive to the IMF used. Yet, the normalization of the color\u2013\nM/L relation is highly IMF dependent, shifting up and down depending on\nhow many stars are present at the low-mass end of the stellar IMF (these stars\ncontribute significantly to the mass of a population, but insignificantly to its\nluminosity and color).\nIn Bell & de Jong (2001) we used maximum disk rotation curves to constrain\nthe normalization of the color\u2013M/L relation. The predicted stellar population\nmasses derived from the color\u2013M/L relation should never over-predict the observed dynamical masses derived from rotation curves. However, while rotating gas in a disk galaxy is a very simple dynamical system and hence a clean\nconstraint, rotation curves of disk galaxies have the disadvantage that they only\nprovide an upper limit to M/L ratios once we accept that dark matter may be\npresent in disk galaxies. There is no guarantee that there is no unseen matter contributing to the dynamical mass within the radius where the maximum\ndisk is constrained, be it baryonic (e.g., cold molecular gas) or non-baryonic.\nHence, rotation curves only provide an upper limit to the normalization of the\ncolor\u2013M/L relation. Here we compare dynamical masses and masses predicted\nby stellar population modeling of a variety of stellar systems in order to constrain the normalization of the color\u2013M/L relation1 .\n\n2.\n\nComparing dynamical and population M/L estimates\n\nIn order to compare dynamical and stellar population masses we have to\nmake a number of assumptions:\nThe IMFs of the stellar populations in the different objects are the same,\nnotwithstanding the large range in object scale sizes and masses involved.\nThe stellar population models used are accurate in a relative sense (not\nnecessary in absolute calibration).\nThe stellar systems in question have not selectively lost (or accreted)\nstars in a particular mass range.\nWhere necessary we use the HST Key Project distance scale.\nWe will now go through a number of dynamical/gravitational versus stellar\npopulation mass comparisons, and express the range of allowed population\nM/L ratios in terms of the IMF normalization used in Bell & de Jong (2001),\n1 In principle, any of these systems could have a dark component co-spatial with the stellar light (in some\ncases this is rather unlikely), and hence all comparisons are strictly speaking upper limits to the relation.\n\n\fComparing Dynamical and Stellar Pop-ulation Mass-to-Light Ratio Estimates\n\n3\n\ni.e. a Salpeter x=1.35 IMF between 0.1 and 125 M\u2299 reduced in mass by a\nfactor 0.72 .\nGlobular Clusters At first sight globular clusters seem ideal targets to compare dynamical and stellar population masses: their stellar populations, dust\ncorrections and dynamics are simple, and they are unlikely to contain large\namounts of dark matter near their centers. However, mass segregation has resulted in centers of clusters being dominated by massive stars, the outer parts\nby lower mass stars. The outer stars are subsequently more likely to be stripped\nby interaction with the galaxy, making it even harder to get a good sampling of\nthe original full IMF. Detailed dynamical modeling of Galactic globular clusters shows clear evidence of these effects, with M/L changing with radius (e.g.,\nGebhardt & Fischer 1995).\nWhen we compute the dynamical core M/L ratios of Galactic globular clusters following McLaughlin (2000) and compare those to single burst PEGASE\n(Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997) models using the colors and metallicities\nof Harris (1996), we find that the dynamical M/L values are much lower (by\nabout 0.23 dex) than predicted by the single burst models of a 10\u201312 Gyr old\npopulation. Alternatively, we can follow a more simplified approach by using\nvirial masses (Pryor & Meylan 1993), which are more representative of the total globular cluster. We find that the 12 Gyr stellar population masses are lower\nby 0.10 dex than the virial masses when using our Bell & de Jong (2001) IMF\nnormalization, albeit with a large scatter of 0.20 dex rms (comparable to the\nuncertainties in the dynamical M/L values).\nIn recent years it has also become possible to measure virial masses of globular clusters in other nearby galaxies. This has the advantage that it is easier\nto get integrated properties the globular clusters and many objects at the same\ndistance, but as disadvantage the limited accuracy that can be reached, even\nwith 8 m class telescopes. The results of extra-galactic globular clusters are\nstill inconclusive, with dynamical masses of Cen A as measured by Martini &\nHo (2004) being more massive than our stellar population model predictions\nby 0.08 dex, but the dynamical masses of M33 (Larsen et al. 2002) being 0.27\ndex lower than predicted.\nElliptical galaxies Recently, Cappellari et al. (2006) have performed a detailed analysis of dynamical and stellar populations masses of a sample of\nearly-type galaxies. Their integral field spectrograph SAURON data allows\nthem to derive accurate dynamical masses using Schwarzschild modeling and\nstellar population masses using line-strength indices modeling. Using a Kroupa\n(2001) IMF and Vazdekis et al. (1999) stellar population synthesis models, they\n\n2 We do not explicitly include a mass contribution for objects with masses less than 0.1 M ; as argued later,\n\u2299\nthe contribution from brown dwarf or planetary regime objects to the stellar M/L is expected to be 0.04 dex\nor less.\n\n\f4\nfind that old, fast rotating elliptical galaxies have dynamical and stellar population masses that are very similar. Younger, fast rotating elliptical galaxies have\nsmaller stellar population masses than dynamical masses, but they can be made\nto agree by assuming that the young ages are the result of a superposition of\na dominant, old massive population and a small, young population. However,\nslowly rotating, old massive elliptical galaxies seem to have higher dynamical\nthan stellar population M/L ratios, a discrepancy that cannot be solved by a\nsuper-position of young and old populations, because the population already is\nold according to the line indices.\nCappellari et al. (2006) argue that under the assumption that the IMF is\nthe same for all galaxies this must mean that these massive, slowly rotating\ngalaxies have a significant dark matter within their effective radius where the\ndynamical measure was made. However, once we accept that some elliptical\ngalaxies must have a dynamically significant amount of dark matter in their\ncentral region, we cannot exclude that all elliptical galaxies have dark matter\ncontributing to their central dynamics. Therefore, the comparison of stellar\npopulation and dynamical masses in elliptical galaxies becomes an upper limit\nto the normalization of the \"IMF mass\", identical to the maximum disk rotation curve constraint. In terms of this mass normalization, this argues for a\n\u223c 0.05 dex lower normalization that used by Bell & de Jong (2001), given that\nthe Vazdekis models include masses down to 0.01 M\u2299 .\nMaximum disk rotation curves: As described above, we used maximum\ndisk rotation curve limits to normalize the color\u2013M/L relation in Bell & de\nJong (2001). In Kassin, de Jong & Weiner (2006) we have repeated this analysis, but we expanded the Verheijen (1997) Ursa Major cluster sample with\n34 luminous galaxies and improved the treatment of shifting the mass models to another distance. We compared the maximum disk values to the updated\ncolor\u2013M/L relations of Bell et al. (2003) and find that the Bell & de Jong (2001)\nnormalization is fully consistent with this expanded data set. The normalization may at best be 0.05 dex higher to account for the scatter in the color\u2013M/L\nrelation.\nMinimum disk rotation curves: While most galaxy rotation curves are fairly\nsmooth, some show enough structure to allow determination of a lower limit\nto a stellar M/L to explain these structures under the assumption that the dark\nmatter component is smooth (e.g., Noordermeer et al. 2004). Such analysis is\ncomplicated by the unknown intrinsic distribution of dark matter, the effect of\nadiabatic contraction, and rotation curve uncertainties (including non-circular\nmotions). Using NGC 157 (Kassin et al. 2006) we find a lower limit of -0.3 dex\nwith respect to the Bell & de Jong (2001) normalization to explain the strongly\ndeclining rotation curve of this galaxy. However, the large asymmetries and\nhence large errorbars on the rotation curve of this galaxy limits the usefulness\n\n\fComparing Dynamical and Stellar Pop-ulation Mass-to-Light Ratio Estimates\n\n5\n\nof this galaxy. More suitable systems (mainly early-type spiral galaxies with\nfalling rotation curves) are studied by Noordermeer (2006).\nDisk velocity dispersions: The mass and scale height distribution determine\nthe vertical velocity dispersion of a self-gravitating disk. Thus, to determine a\ndisk mass from a measured vertical velocity dispersion in a face-on system we\nhave to make assumptions about the (unobservable) vertical stellar distribution,\nwhile for edge-on systems, where we can measure the vertical stellar distribution, we have to relate the observed radial and tangential velocity dispersion\nto the (unobservable) vertical velocity dispersion (Bottema 1997). Recently,\nKregel et al. (2005) used velocity dispersions of a sample of 15 edge-on galaxies to determine a dynamical mass Tully-Fisher relation and compared it to the\nstellar population mass Tully-Fisher relation of Bell & de Jong (2001). They\nfind an offset of about -0.24 dex, assuming a vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio (\u03c3z /\u03c3R ) of 0.6. However, the determined M/L ratio scales quadratically with the poorly known \u03c3z /\u03c3R ratio. To the best of our knowledge, only\n3 measurements of \u03c3z /\u03c3R have been made to date, ranging between 0.5 and\n0.9 (Gerssen, Kuijken, & Merrifield 2000). Without substantially better understanding of the behavior of \u03c3z /\u03c3R as a function of galaxy properties, it is\nunclear that one can place competitive constraints on stellar M/L ratios using\nthis method.\nBar streaming motions: A galactic bar moving through the interstellar medium\ncreates streaming motions and often a shock, the size of which depends somewhat on the pattern speed of the bar, but mostly on the mass of the bar. Weiner\net al. (2001; 2004) obtained H\u03b1 velocity fields of NGC 4123 and NGC 3095\nand modeled these with fluid-dynamical models. Their models only permit a\nlimited range in stellar M/L, such that the galaxies are close to maximum disk.\nIn Fig. 1 we compare the local bar colors and the derived M/L values of these\ntwo galaxies to the stellar population models of a range in metallicity and with\nexponentially decaying star formation rates. We show the models normalized\nat the Bell & de Jong (2001) value on the left, reduced by 0.1 dex in M/L\non the right. The models cover a limited area in these diagrams, showing the\nage-metallicity degeneracy that makes the color\u2013M/L relation work in the first\nplace.\nWe expect the central region to suffer from extinction, and we have plotted indicative dereddening vectors on the measured data points. These vectors\nwere derived from Tully et al. (1998) global galaxy reddening values, and the\nextinction in the central region may be somewhat higher. The left panel, where\nthe Bell & de Jong normalization is used, shows that the raw and reddeningcorrected stellar M/L ratios are consistent with the model normalization. The\nright-hand panel, with the model stellar M/L values decreased by 0.1 dex compared to Bell & de Jong (2001), is just consistent with the reddening-corrected\ndata. The bar streaming motions modeling therefore provides some of the\n\n\f6\n\nFigure 1. Comparing the Weiner et al.

We plot 12 Gyr old exponential\ndecaying star formation rate models with different decay rates \u03c4 connected by solid lines, different metallicities by dotted lines, as indicated. The two data points for NGC 4123 and NGC 3095\nare indicated with formal errorbars. The arrows on the data points indicate the reddening for\nthese galaxies according to Tully et al. (1998). On the left we show the Bell & de Jong (2001)\nnormalization, at the right a 0.1 dex lower normalization.\n\nstrongest constraints on our color\u2013M/L normalization, allowing only a range\nof \u223c0.2 dex.\nP\u00e9rez et al. (2004) confirm the analysis of Weiner et al. (2001) to the extent\nthat, for the two out of their sample of five galaxies for which they could derive\nM/L constraints, the barred galaxies had to be close to maximum disk (at least\n80% stellar mass contribution in bar region).\nSpiral arm streaming motions: In a similar fashion, streaming motions can\nbe used to estimate the mass in a spiral density wave. Clearly this is a more\nchallenging exercise, as arm-induced shocks and streaming motions are much\nweaker than those induced by bars. Kranz et al. (2003) studied five high surface\nbrightness galaxies with long-slit spectra and optical/near-IR surface photometry. They can only weakly constrain stellar M/L (their Table 3), and find i)\nmost of their sample have maximum disk M/L values consistent with the Bell\n& de Jong calibration, and ii) most high vrot disks are consistent with close\nto maximum disk, whereas the lower rotation velocity disks could be substantially sub-maximal (with less than \u223c60% of the disk mass coming from stars\nwithin 2.2 disk scalelengths).\nStrong galaxy lensing: Strong gravitational lensing provides an estimate of\nthe gravitational mass within the lens area with rather straightforward modeling. To compare the gravitational mass of the lens with its stellar population\nmass we have to correct the observed colors using k-corrections or better yet,\nredshift the model spectra to the lens redshift and calculate a new color\u2013M/L\ngrid in the observed bands. Furthermore, we have to realize that galaxies are\nyounger at higher redshift and the color\u2013M/L relation will shift. For simplic-\n\n\fComparing Dynamical and Stellar Pop-ulation Mass-to-Light Ratio Estimates\n\n7\n\nity we can model this with exponentially declining star formation rate models\n(which becomes an increasingly poorer approximation at higher redshift, because starbursts will become relatively more important). Such exponentially\ndeclining models - started 12 Gyr ago - have color\u2013M/L relations in restframe colors that are decreased by 0.15 dex at redshift 1 compared to the z=0\nrelation.\nTo minimize these corrections a lensing galaxy at low redshift should be\nused in the gravitational to stellar mass comparison. Furthermore, the lensed\nimages should be of small angular separation, surrounding only the central\nregion of the lens galaxy, which is most likely to be dominated by stellar mass.\nWe should keep in mind that any masses derived from lensing, like maximum\nrotation curves, only provides an upper limit to the stellar population mass\nestimates, as significant dark matter may be present in the centers of some\ngalaxies as also suggested by the Cappellari et al. (2006) elliptical galaxies\nresult.\nIndications from the first studies to satisfy these criteria are encouraging.\nSmith et al. (2005) present an example of a low redshift (z=0.0345), tight lens,\nfinding a M/LI \u223c1.8, M/LB \u223c4.7. Using the reported F475W and F814W\nobserved magnitudes, galactic foreground corrections, and k-corrections assuming a non-evolving ancient galaxy template (solar metallicity and \u223c12 Gyr\nold), we find excellent agreement with the predicted stellar M/L values, as usual\naccounting for gas recycling from ageing stellar populations (M/LI,pred \u223c1.8,\nM/LB,pred \u223c4.5). Koopmans et al. (2006) analyze an extensive sample of 15\nlenses with z=0.06\u20130.33. In this case, the dynamically-derived total M/L scale\nis compared with the lensing results, finding consistency (i.e., they have roughly\ncross-checked the dynamical mass scale - e.g., Cappellari et al.'s scale -\nwith the lensing scale). A more careful, explicit test of the color-derived stellar\nmass scale with the lensing mass scale is clearly warranted.\n\n3.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn Fig. 2 we give an overview of all constraints derived in the previous section on stellar population M/L values relative to an IMF normalization of Bell\n& de Jong (2001). The strongest constraints are currently provided by the\nWeiner et al. (2001, 2004) constraints from bar streaming motions. However,\nthis constraint is derived from only two galaxies, and is therefore very susceptible to for instance errors in the distances to the galaxies. We have indicated\nin Fig. 2 the effect of 15% distance errors, which accounts for 0.075 dex offset in the M/L IMF normalization. Another source of uncertainty lies in the\nstellar population modeling. The Padova isochrone tracks (Girardi et al. 2002)\nare used in many of the popular models (e.g., Charlot & Bruzual 2003; Fioc\n& Rocca-Volmerange 1997; Vazdekis 1999) and these models all give very\n\n\f8\n\nFigure 2. Overview of offsets between dynamical and stellar population mass estimates relative to the normalization of Bell & de Jong. Ranges are indicated by horizontal errorbars, upper\nand lower limits are indicated with horizontal arrows. The vertical dotted line indicates the\nour best estimate for the offset given all constraints. The uncertainty in this offset caused by\n15% distance errors are indicated at the top. The vertical arrows indicate offsets expected for a\nKroupa (2001) IMF (left, green) and a Kennicutt (1983) IMF (right, cyan).\n\nsimilar results in terms of the color\u2013M/L relation. However, a class of models based on the fuel consumption theorem that treats the late stages of stellar\nevolution differently are giving somewhat different results, especially in the\ninfrared where AGB and RGB stars dominate (e.g., Maraston 2005). These\nmodels have indeed a slightly steeper slope in the color\u2013M/L relation, especially in the near-infrared, but surprisingly the normalizations of the different\nsets of models are very consistent in the intermediate color range where most\nof the normalization constraints are derived. Combining all constraints, we\nargue that the most likely normalization is about 0.05\u20130.1 dex lower than the\nBell & de Jong (2001) normalization, i.e. a Salpeter x=1.35 IMF between 0.1\nand 125 M\u2299 reduced in mass by a factor 0.6 (-0.22 dex).\nThis normalization is consistent with for instance the Kroupa (2001) or\nChabrier (2003) IMFs (offset by about -0.25 dex with respect to Salpeter IMF)\nand a Kennicutt (1983) IMF (-0.3 dex). It leaves however not much margin\nfor other unseen but known mass components in the dynamical comparisons.\nStellar and substellar objects below our 0.1 M\u2299 mass limit could contribute up\nto 10% (0.04 dex) of the IMF mass. A significant molecular gas component in\n\n\fComparing Dynamical and Stellar Pop-ulation Mass-to-Light Ratio Estimates\n\n9\n\nthe inner part of spiral galaxies could push down the rotation curve constraint.\nHowever, it is satisfying to see that the current Galactic IMF estimates give\nstellar mass estimates in a wide range of objects that are fully consistent with\ntheir dynamical masses.\n\nReferences\nBell, E.
