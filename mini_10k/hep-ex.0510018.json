It can measure the disappearance parameters with precision and\ndetermine the mass hierarchy. If \u03b813 is large enough the CP violating phase can be measured with neutrino running alone and anti-neutrino running can confirm CPV and improve the parameter measurements. Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory is pursuing such an experiment.\n\ntrino energy is below \u223c 500 MeV. Avoiding this\nrequires high neutrino energies and placing the far\ndetector at a baseline that is long enough for multiple oscillation periods to occur well away from\nthis Fermi motion dominated energy region. Current best fits of \u2206m232 implies a baseline of > 2000\nkm and an energy coverage from above the Fermimotion dominated range up to \u223c10 GeV.\nFinally, in order to collect enough statistics a\nmassive detector, a high intensity neutrino source\nand a sufficiently long running time are needed.\nWe assume a Water Cherenkov detector of 500\nkTon fiducial mass, such as UNO or HyperK with\nperformance as good or slightly better than current Super-Kamiokande.\nAn upgrade[1] to the BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) will initially produce a 1\nMW proton beam. The Booster will be replaced\nby a 1.2 GeV super-conducting Linac that will\nincrease the protons per pulse from 7 to 9 \u00d7 1013\nand allow the fill time to be reduced from 0.6 second to 1.0 millisecond. Power supply and magnet\nupgrades will be needed to improve the AGS repetition rate from 0.5 Hz to 2.5 Hz.\nThe proton beam will be directed to a fixed\ntarget and conventional focusing horn system positioned on a \u223c50 m tall hill. The secondaries\nwill decay down a 200 m long, 4 m wide tunnel\npointing towards the far detector producing the\nexpected neutrino flux shown in Fig. 1. The far\nsite is assumed to be either of the two DUSEL\ncandidates, Homestake, SD or Henderson, CO at\n\n1. Introduction\nAs shown at this conference and elsewhere, one\nof the main challenges in measuring neutrino oscillation parameters in most current and proposed\nexperiments are degeneracies.\nBrookhaven National Laboratory is designing\nan experiment that can break these degeneracies,\nmeasure or limit all neutrino parameters, determine the mass hierarchy and be sensitive to new\nphysics. This experiment incorporates intense,\nwide band and high energy neutrino and antineutrino beams, a very long baseline and a massive far detector.\n2. Motivation for Experiment Parameters\nThe primary motivation for this arrangement is\nto observe multiple neutrino oscillation periods.\nThis provides two main benefits over traditional\nsingle oscillation LBNO experiments. First, since\npeak-to-valley and node-to-node features of the\ndisappearance oscillation pattern can be resolved,\na precision measurement of \u2206m232 and sin2 2\u03b823\ncan be made which is not strongly dependent on\nabsolute event normalization. Second, the effects\nthat govern \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde appearance have different\nstrengths at different energies so by resolving multiple appearance peaks these, otherwise degenerate effects, can be disentangled.\nFermi motion of the nuclei in the active\nmedium of the far detector begins to dominate\nthe reconstructed energy resolution when the neu1\n\n\f2\n2540 km and 2770 km from BNL, respectively.\nInitial running will determine the mass hierarchy\nand dictate the subsequent running mode. The\nnominal run plan is 5 years1 neutrino running at\n1 MW followed by 5 years anti-neutrino running\nat 2 MW.\n\nnu/GeV/m2/POT at 1 km\n\nBNL Wide Band.

Illustrative Oscillation Probability Plots\nThis presentation attempts to focus on how the\ndegeneracies in the parameters governing \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde\nappearance are broken through examining simple\noscillation probability plots. The cost of this simplicity is to ignore the extremely critical issues of\ndetector performance. These issues are being addressed in the larger context of the concept and\nother work[2,3] has gone in to more detail.\nUnless otherwise stated, for these probabilities\nplots the nominal values are taken to be there current best fits: \u2206m221 = 8.0e-5 eV2 , \u2206m232 = 2.5e-3\neV2 , sin2 (2\u03b823 ) = 1.0, sin2 (2\u03b812 ) = 0.86. For the\nunknown values we take sin2 (2\u03b813 ) = 0.04 and\n1 We\n\ntake 1 year = 107 seconds.\n\n\u03b4CP = 0. The baseline is taken to be the BNLHomestake one of 2540 km. The longer BNLHenderson is essentially equivalent. The neutrinos are propagated through the PREM[4] Earth\ndensity profile.\nFigure 2 shows four affects to the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde appearance probability over the energy range covered by the VLBNO flux. Figure 2.a shows that\nthe features are well centered in the region of\nflux coverage. If the true value of \u2206m232 varies\nwithin current uncertainties all features are still\nwell within the flux coverage.\nFigure 2.b shows the large matter effect and\nthat it appears almost entirely in the first peak.\nThe effect due to the sign of \u2206m232 will produce\na clear result.\nFigure 2.c shows that the effect of a CP violating phase increases as one goes to higher oscillations (lower energy).\nFigure 2.d shows that with \u03b813 = 0 the BNL\nVLBNO experiment is expected to see \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde\nappearance in the sub-GeV region due to subdominant \u2206m221 driven oscillations. This provides a unique terrestrial based measurement of\nsolar neutrino parameters which can be checked\nagainst solar neutrino data from SK and SNO.\nAny deviation can be a sign of new physics.\nTable 1 summarizes these effects and illustrates\nin what energy range they dominate. The value\nof \u03b813 effects the absolute event rate independently of energy. The mass hierarchy strongly\ninfluences the rates above 2 GeV. The value of\n\u03b4CP is greatest in the middle energy range of 1-2\nGeV. Finally, \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde appearance due to solar\noscillations is very strong, but only in the lower\nenergy range below 1 GeV. It is this distribution\nof effects across the energy range that allows the\nBNL VLBNO experiment to break the degeneracies. Any LBNO experiment which targets a single oscillation will not be able to disentangle these\neffects without the proper addition of other detectors, baselines or completely separate experiments.\nThe plots in Figure 3 show expected spectra\nand parameter resolutions.
