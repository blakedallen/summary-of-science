Suppose that for a fixed value of each of the parameters which\nenter in the definition of the R(xi ) some of the relations reduce to the constraint that\nthe algebra be commutative. We refer to these as commutation relations. The remaining\nrelations become constraints in the commutative limit and define the noncommutative\ngeneralization of a submanifold of RN . We suppose for simplicity that there is only\none relation of this form. The commutative limit will describe then a submanifold V of\ndimension N \u2212 1 embedded in RN . If one introduce the moving frame dxi on RN then the\nlatter acquires the structure of a flat differential manifold. This defines by the embedding,\nthat is, by the relations, a moving frame \u03b8\u03b1 on V , which one can always choose so that\nlocally the last component is normal to V . When V is parallelizable this choice can be\nmade globally and the module of sections T of the cotangent bundle T \u2217 (V ) is free. In all\ncases the embedding defines a splitting of the module of sections AN of T \u2217 (RN ) into a\ndirect sum\nAN = T \u2295 N\n(1.1)\nof T and a free module N of rank one. The metric and the frame on V are determined\nby the embedding relations. The construction is most elegantly described in terms of\nprojections in the matrix algebra Mat N (A), i.e. elements e \u2208 Mat N (A) such that e2 =\ne = e\u2217 . It is a consequence of the Serre-Swan theorem (cf. [7, 18, 20, 15]) that to\nevery vector bundle over V corresponds an equivalence class of projections in a matrix\nalgebra Mat r (A), for a suitable r. The module of sections of the bundle is a projective\nmodule of finite type over the algebra A and conversely any such a module can be realized\nas the module of sections of a bundle; and these modules are naturally characterized by\nprojections. This correspondence quite naturally generalizes the notion of a vector bundle\nover a noncommutative algebra.\nWe shall see that in the case of the quantum Euclidean spheres SqN \u22121 a projection\ne \u2208 Mat 2n (SqN \u22121 ), with N = 2n or N = 2n + 1, can be so chosen that the relations\nwhich define it (e2 = e = e\u2217 ) are equivalent to the relations R(xi ) which define the algebra A of the spheres. As already mentioned, the projections can be regarded as defining\nmodules of sections of bundles over the spheres which then will be q-generalizations of\nmonopoles, instantons or more general twisted configurations. As in the classical situation, the bundles should be characterized by integer valued topological charges (Chern\nnumbers); work on these is in progress and will be reported somewhere else.\nIn Section 2 some basic results [13] about the general N-dimensional quantum Euclidean\nN \u22121\nspaces RN\nare reviewed. In Section 3 we shall\nq and quantum Euclidean spheres Sq\nintroduce the projections which determine (and are determined by) the spheres relations\nand which, in turn, define twisted configurations over the spheres SqN \u22121 . We shall describe\nin detail the cases N = 3, 4, 5, 6, that is, the spheres of dimensions 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively\nand outline the general case. Not surprisingly, 'even and odd dimensional' spheres will\nbehave differently. In Section 4 we construct the projections for the normal and cotangent\n\n2\n\n\fbundles over the spheres SqN \u22121 . The final remarks concern some preliminary results on\nthe computation of topological charges.\n\n2\n\nQuantum Euclidean Planes and Spheres\n\nIn this section some basic results [13] (see also [6]) about the general N-dimensional\nN\nN \u22121\nquantum Euclidean spaces CN\nare reviewed. We start with the\nq and Rq and spheres Sq\nmatrix R\u0302 for the quantum group SOq (N, C). It is a symmetric N 2 \u00d7 N 2 matrix and its\nmain property is that it satisfies the braid relation. It admits a projector decomposition:\nR\u0302 = qP(s) \u2212 q \u22121 P(a) + q 1\u2212N P(t) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the P(s) , P(a) , P(t) are SOq (N)-covariant q-deformations of the symmetric tracefree, antisymmetric and trace projectors respectively. The projector P(t) projects onto a\nij\nmn\none-dimensional sub-space and can be written in the form P(t)\ngmn )\u22121 g ij gkl . This\nkl = (g\nleads to the definition of a deformed metric matrix, the N \u00d7 N matrix gij given by\ngij = q \u2212\u03c1i \u03b4i,\u2212j .\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich is a SOq (N)-isotropic tensor. If n is the rank of SO(N, C), i.e. the integer part\nin N/2, the indices take the values i = \u2212n, . . . , \u22121, 0, 1, . . . , n for N = 2n + 1, and\ni = \u2212n, . . . , \u22121, 1, . . . , n for N = 2n. Moreover, we have introduced the notation\n\u03c1i =\n\n(\n\n(n \u2212 12 , . . . , 12 , 0, \u2212 21 , . . . , 21 \u2212 n)\n(n \u2212 1, . . . , 0, 0, . . . , 1 \u2212 n)\n\nfor N = 2n + 1,\nfor N = 2n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe metric and the braid matrix satisfy the 'gT T ' relations [13]\n\u22131 ij lk\ng il R\u0302\u00b11 jk\nlh = R\u0302 hl g .\n\n\u22131hl\ngil R\u0302\u00b11lh\nij glk ,\njk = R\u0302\n\n(2.4)\n\nWith the help of the projector P(a) , the N-dimensional quantum Euclidean space is defined\ni\nas the associative algebra CN\nq generated by elements {x }i=\u2212n,...,n with relations\nP(a) ij kl xk xl = 0.\n\n(2.5)\n\nor, more explicitly [23]\n\u22121 2\nk\u03c9i\u22121\nri\u22121\ni\n\u2212i\n[x , x ] = \uf8f4 0\n\uf8f3\nhr02\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nfor i > 1\nx x = qx x for i < j, i 6= \u2212j,\nfor i = 1, N = 2n,\nfor i = 1, N = 2n + 1.\n(2.6)\n1\n1\nWe use the notation \u03c9i = q \u03c1i + q \u2212\u03c1i , h = q 2 \u2212 q \u2212 2 , k = q \u2212 q \u22121 and\ni j\n\nj i\n\nri2 =\n\ni\nX\n\nk,l=\u2212i\n\ngkl xk xl ,\n\ni \u2265 0 for N = 2n + 1, i \u2265 1 for N = n.\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fThe last element r 2 \u2261 rn2 can be shown to be central.\nFor q \u2208 R+ a conjugation (xi )\u2217 = xj gji can be defined on CN\nq to obtain what is known as\nN\nthe quantum real Euclidean space Rq .

Thus, the quantum Euclidean sphere SqN \u22121 is naturally considered as a quantum\nsubspace of the quantum Euclidean space RN\nq and the algebra of functions on the sphere\nis a quotient of the algebra of functions on the quantum Euclidean space, the quotient\nbeing taken by the ideal generated by the relation that fixes the radius. Furthermore, the\nspheres SqN \u22121 are invariant under the action of the quantum groups SOq (N) on them.\nIt is easy to see that the spheres SqN \u22121 have a S 1 worth of classical points. Indeed, let\nr \u2208 R \\ {0} be the radius of the sphere. Then, with \u03bb \u2208 C such that |\u03bb|2 = 1, there is a\nfamily of 1-dimensional representations (characters) of the algebra SqN \u22121 given by\n\u03c4\u03bb (1) = 1, \u03c4\u03bb (xn ) = \u221a\n\nr\nr\nn \u2217\n\u221a\n\u03bb,\n\u03c4\n((x\n)\n)\n=\n\u03bb\u0304 ,\n\u03bb\n1 + q \u22122\u03c1n\n1 + q \u22122\u03c1n\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u03c4\u03bb (xi ) = \u03c4\u03bb ((xi )\u2217 ) = 0 ,\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 or i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 according to whether N = 2n + 1 or N = 2n.\nClearly these representations will yield traces on the algebras SqN \u22121 .\n\n3\n\nTwisted configurations over SqN\u22121\n\nWe shall now introduce a hermitian idempotent or projection, an element e \u2208 Mat 2n (SqN \u22121 )\nsatisfying the conditions e = e2 = e\u2217 which determine the structure of the algebra SqN \u22121 .\nThe star here is the formal adjoint in the complete matrix algebra and N is even or odd.\nThese projections, in turn, can be thought of as defining modules of sections of bundles\n4\n\n\fover the spheres SqN \u22121 which are q-generalizations of monopoles and instanton bundles or\nmore general twisted configurations. We shall use a matrix trace together with the trace\ndetermined by the representations (2.11) to compute the rank which, for the projector in\nquestion, will turn out to be equal to 2n\u22121 . At the moment we are unable to compute the\ntopological charges in general; work on this is in progress and will be reported elsewhere.\nWe shall describe in detail the cases N = 3, 4, 5, 6, that is the spheres of dimensions\n2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. We shall also outline the general case which in principle can be\nobtained using the same techniques.\n\n3.1\n\nMonopoles on the Euclidean sphere Sq2\n\nWith a suitable rescaling of the generators the Euclidean sphere Sq2 can be identified with\nthe so called equator sphere of Podle\u015b [24]. For its presentation we have the following\ngenerators\n\u221a\nxi = ( qx\u22171 , x0 , x1 ),\n(3.1)\nwith (x0 )\u2217 = x0 , and commutation relations (2.8) given by\nx\u22171 x0 = qx0 x\u22171 ,\n\nx0 x1 = qx1 x0 ,\n\n[x1 , x\u22171 ] = (1 \u2212 q \u22121 )x20 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThese commutation relations give for the central element r 2 the equivalent expressions\nr 2 = qx1 x\u22171 + x20 + x\u22171 x1\n= qx20 + (1 + q)x\u22171 x1 = q \u22121 x20 + (1 + q)x1 x\u22171 .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThen, a straightforward computation yields that the element e \u2208 Mat 2 (Sq2 ) given by\n\uf8eb\n\n1 1 + q \u22121/2 r \u22121 x0\ne= \uf8ed\n2 (1 + q)1/2 r \u22121 x\u22171\n\n(1 + q)1/2 r \u22121 x1\n1 \u2212 q 1/2 r \u22121 x0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhich is hermitian by construction, is also idempotent, e2 = e, if and only if all the\nrelations (3.2) and (3.3) which define Sq2 are satisfied.\nWhen the Euclidean sphere Sq2 is identified with Podle\u015b equator sphere the projector (3.4)\ncoincides with the one found in [5] where projectors for all Podle\u015b spheres were constructed\n(a projector on the so called Podle\u015b standard sphere had already been constructed in [16]).\nThe projection (3.4) (and the corresponding vector bundle over Sq2 ) is of rank 1,\n\u0010\n\nrank(e) =: \u03c4\u03bb \u25e6 T r(e) = \u03c4\u03bb 1 +\n\n\u0011\n1 \u22121/2\nq\n(1 \u2212 q) x0 = 1 ,\n2r\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere we have used the 1-dimensional representations (2.11) and T r denotes a matrix\ntrace. In order to compute the topological charge of the bundle we need a cyclic 0-cocycle,\ni.e. a trace \u03c4 1 , on the reduced algebra S \u0304q2 = Sq2 /C1 . This computation is an example\nof the pairing between K-theory and cyclic cohomology [7]. In the present situation the\n5\n\n\fcyclic cocycle one needs is of degree zero since for Sq2 all cyclic cohomology is in HC 0(Sq2 )\nwhile the even cyclic cohomology HC n (Sq2 ), n > 0, is the image of the periodicity operator\n[22]. The trace \u03c4 1 was found in [22] and on the generators (3.1) gives in particular\n\u03c4 1 (x0 )) = \u22122r q 1/2\n\n1\n.\n1\u2212q\n\n(3.6)\n\nThen, with [T r(e)] \u2208 S \u0304q2 , the topological charge of the projection e is found to be\n\u03c4 1 ([T r(e)]) = \u03c4 1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n1 \u22121/2\nq\n(1 \u2212 q) x0 = \u22121 ,\n2r\n\n(3.7)\n\nas it should be given the analogous computations in [4] and [16] for the computations of\ntopological charges of q-monopoles on Podle\u015b spheres. The fact that the pairing in (3.7)\ngives an integer number is a consequence of a noncommutative index theorem [7] since\nthe trace \u03c4 1 is the character of a Fredholm module [22]. The trace (3.6) is singular in\nthe classical limit q = 1. In the latter limit the bundle corresponding to the projection\n(3.4) is the monopole bundle over the classical sphere S 2 of topological charge (first Chern\nnumber) equal to \u22121 which is computed by integrating a 2-form on S 2 [19] (classically\nthe relevant cyclic cocycle is in degree two and is associated with the volume form of the\nsphere).\n\n3.2\n\nInstantons on the Euclidean sphere Sq4\n\nIn this section we generalize the projector (3.4) on the sphere Sq2 to a projector on the\nsphere Sq4 and indicate how to further generalize it to any even quantum Euclidean sphere.\nThe generators of the algebra Sq4 are the five elements\nxi = (q 3/2 x\u22172 , q 1/2 x\u22171 , x0 , x1 , x2 ),\n\n(3.8)\n\nwith (x0 )\u2217 = x0 . Then the commutation relations (2.8) are\nx\u2217i xj = qxj x\u2217i ,\n\nxi xj = qxj xi , i < j;\n[x1 , x\u22171 ]\n[x2 , x\u22172 ]\n\n= (1 \u2212 q\n\n\u22121\n\n)x20 ,\n\u22121\n\n\u0010\n\ni 6= j,\n\n= q \u22121 (1 \u2212 q ) qx1 x\u22171 + x20 + x\u22171 x1\n\u0010\n\n= q \u22121 (1 \u2212 q \u22121 ) qx20 + (1 + q)x\u22171 x1\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n= q \u22121 (1 \u2212 q \u22121 ) q \u22121 x20 + (1 + q)x1 x\u22171 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThese commutation relations give for the central element r 2 the equivalent expressions\nr 2 = q 3 x2 x\u22172 + qx1 x\u22171 + x20 + x\u22171 x1 + x\u22172 x2\n1 + q3 2\n= (1 + q 3 )x\u22172 x2 + (1 + q 3 )x\u22171 x1 + q\nx\n1+q 0\n1 + q3 2\nx.\n= (1 + q 3 )x2 x\u22172 + q \u22122 (1 + q 3 )x1 x\u22171 + q \u22123\n1+q 0\n6\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fTo alleviate the notation we now consider the case r 2 = [(1 + q 3)/(1 + q)] * 1. Equivalently\nwe could have suitably rescaled the generators. The previous sphere relations reduce to\n1 = (1 + q)x\u22172 x2 + (1 + q)x\u22171 x1 + qx20\n= (1 + q)x2 x\u22172 + q \u22122 [ (1 + q)x1 x\u22171 + q \u22121 x20 ].\n\n(3.11)\n\nThen, a straightforward computation yields that the element e \u2208 Mat 4 (Sq4 ) given by\n\uf8eb\n\n1 + q \u22123/2 x0\n\n\u22121\n1/2 \u2217\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8ec q (1 + q) x1\ne= \uf8ec\n1/2 \u2217\n2\uf8ec\n\uf8ed (1 + q) x2\n\nq \u22121 (1 + q)1/2 x1\n\n(1 + q)1/2 x2\n\n1 \u2212 q \u22121/2 x0\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec\n\n0\n\n1 \u2212 q \u22121/2 x0\n\n0\n\n(1 + q)1/2 x\u22172\n\n\u2212(1 + q)1/2 x\u22171\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(1 + q)1/2 x2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n\u2212(1 + q)1/2 x1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n1 + q 1/2 x0\n\n\uf8f7\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhich is hermitian by construction, is also idempotent, e2 = e, if and only if all the\nrelations (3.9) and and (3.11) which define Sq4 are satisfied. For a generic value of the\nradius r the corresponding idempotent can be easily guessed from the previous expression\nand the analogue one (3.4) for the sphere Sq2 : one has simply to multiply the algebra\ngenerators in (3.12) by the constant [(1 + q 3 )/(1 + q)]1/2 r \u22121 .\nIt is worth stressing the way the relations (3.3) for the sphere Sq2 are incorporated in the\nones (3.11) for the sphere Sq4 . This fact helped in constructing the projection (3.12) for\nSq4 by a suitable use of the projection (3.4) for Sq2 . Indeed, the projection e(4) in (3.12) is\nrelated to the analogous one e(2) in (3.4) by\ne(4) =\n\n\uf8eb\n\nI2 + q \u22121 u(2)\n\n1\uf8ed\n2 (1 + q)1/2 x\u22172 I2\n\n(1 + q)1/2 x2 I2\nI2 \u2212 u(2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(3.13)\n\nwith the hermitian isometry u(2) given by u(2) = 2e(2) \u2212 1. By applying this 'inductive\nconstruction' one can obtain the projections for the higher dimensional even spheres.\nBy using the 1-dimensional representations (2.11) and a matrix trace T r one finds that\nthe projection (3.12) (and the corresponding vector bundle over Sq4 ) is of rank 2,\n\u0011\n1 \u22123/2\nq\n(1 \u2212 q)2 x0 = 2 .\n(3.14)\n2\nAs it happens for the sphere Sq2 described previously, in order to compute the topological\ncharge of the bundle, we need a cyclic 0-cocycle, i.e. a trace \u03c4 1 , on the reduced algebra\nS \u0304q4 = Sq4 /C1, which needs to be combined with the matrix trace. Now, the equivalence\nclass of T r(e) in S \u0304q4 is given by\n\u0010\n\nrank(e) =: \u03c4\u03bb \u25e6 T r(e) = \u03c4\u03bb 2 +\n\n1 \u22123/2\nq\n(1 \u2212 q)2 x0 .\n(3.15)\n2\nand we expect that the trace \u03c4 1 should yield \u22121 on the previous expression. The reason\nto expect a value \u22121 for the topological charge is that in the classical limit q = 1, the\nbundle corresponding to the projection (3.12) is the instanton bundle over the classical\nsphere S 4 of topological charge (second Chern number) equal to \u22121; this is computed by\nintegrating a 4-form on S 4 [19]. As for the sphere Sq2 , the trace \u03c4 1 on Sq4 will be then\nsingular in the classical limit. As for now we have been unable to find such a singular\ntrace on the sphere Sq4 .\n[T r(e)] =\n\n7\n\n\f3.3\n\nSolitons on odd quantum Euclidean spheres\n\nAs already mentioned, odd quantum Euclidean spheres behave in a different manner than\nthe even ones in so that the corresponding projectors are trivial (i.e. they correspond to\ntrivial bundles). On Sq3 this is a consequence of the fact that for the K-theory group one\nhas K0 (Sq3 ) = Z [21] and for higher values of N one expects a similar result.\n3.3.1\n\nThe Euclidean sphere Sq3\n\nWith a suitable rescaling of the generators the Euclidean sphere Sq3 can be identified\nwith the 'quantum sphere' SUq (2) of [28]. The present generators of the algebra are four\nelements\nxi = (qx\u22172 , x\u22171 , x1 , x2 )\n(3.16)\nwith commutation relations (2.8)\nx\u2217i xj = qxj x\u2217i ,\n\nxi xj = qxj xi , i < j;\n[x1 , x\u22171 ]\n\n[x2 , x\u22172 ]\n\n= 0,\n\n= (1 \u2212 q\n\n\u22122\n\n)x1 x\u22171 .\n\ni 6= j,\n\n(3.17)\n\nThe central radial variable can be written as\nr 2 = q 2 x2 x\u22172 + x1 x\u22171 + x\u22171 x1 + x\u22172 x2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n= (1 + q 2 ) x\u22172 x2 + x\u22171 x1 = (1 + q 2 ) x2 x\u22172 + q \u22122 x1 x\u22171 .\n\n(3.18)\n\nTo alleviate the notation we have chosen here the case r 2 = (1 + q 2 ) * 1 so that the previous\nsphere relations reduce to\n1 = x\u22172 x2 + x\u22171 x1 = x2 x\u22172 + q \u22122 x1 x\u22171 .\n\n(3.19)\n\nThen, straightforward computations yield that the element e \u2208 Mat 4 (Sq3 ) given by\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\u22121 \u2217\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8ec q x1\ne= \uf8ec\n\u2217\n2\uf8ec\n\uf8ed x2\n\n\uf8ec\n\n0\n\nq \u22121 x1\n\nx2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx\u22172\n\n\u2212x\u22171\n\nx2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f7\n\u2212x1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.20)\n\n1\n\nwhich is hermitian by construction, is also idempotent, e2 = e, if and only if all the\nrelations (3.17) and and (3.19) which define Sq3 are satisfied.

Apart from some\nidentifications in 'lower dimensions', these spheres are different from analogous objects\ndescribed in [28, 24, 26, 10, 12, 2, 25, 3, 11, 17, 27, 9, 1]. The monopole presented here on\nthe sphere Sq2 coincides with the one constructed in [5] on the equator spheres of [24]. Our\nq-solitons and q-instantons on the spheres Sq3 , Sq4 seems to be different from analogous\nobjects recently found in [12, 2, 25, 3, 11]. It is also clearly different from the instanton\nconstructed in [10]. The present Euclidean spheres are characterized by a 'homological\ndimension drop' which signals the fact that, contrary to the spheres S\u03b84 of [10], they are\nnot noncommutative manifolds and their geometry cannot be a solution of homological\nequations like the ones in [10]. In [10] the spheres S\u03b84 were endowed with a noncommutative\ngeometry via an even spectral triple (A, H, D, \u03b3) where A is a noncommutative algebra\nwith involution * acting on a Z2 -graded Hilbert space H (with grading given by \u03b3) while\nD is a self-adjoint operator on H with compact resolvent and such that [D, a] is bounded\nfor any a \u2208 A [7]. The operator D specify both the metric on the state space of A and\nthe K-homology fundamental class [8]. The geometry for the spheres S\u03b84 is constructed\nby deforming the commutative triple (C \u221e (S 4 ), H, D, \u03b35), where D is the Dirac operator\non the Hilbert space H of square integrable spinors over S 4 and the grading is given by\nthe 'fifth gamma matrix'. In fact, one has an isospectral deformation since both H and D\nare kept fixed, so that all spectral data of the geometry are unchanged, while the algebra\nand its representations are deformed.\nAn important problem that we leave for the future is the computation of topological charges, notably on the quantum Euclidean sphere Sq4 and higher dimensional even\nspheres. This is a difficult task since it involves the construction of Fredholm modules and\ntheir characters which, via the noncommutative index theorem of [7], pair integrally with\nthe K0 group. That the construction is difficult it is already evident from the analogous\nconstructions [21, 22] for the spheres Sq2 and Sq3 . As a preliminary step for this construction we introduce some representations of the algebra of the quantum Euclidean sphere Sq4\n(similar representations can be constructed for any sphere and generalize known results\nfor the quantum spheres Sq2 and Sq3 ).\nLet us then consider again the algebra of Sq4 which is specified by the commutation\nrelations (3.9). And let H be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space with orthonormal\nbasis {\u03c8n,m , n, m = 0, 1, 2, * * * }. We have two representations (see also [14])\n\u03c0(x0 )\u03c8n,m = \u00b1 r\n\u03c0(x1 )\u03c8n,m = r\n\ns\n\n1 + q n+1/2 m+1\nq\nq\n\u03c8n,m ,\n1 + q3\n\nv\nu\nu 1 \u2212 q 2(n+1)\nt\n\n1 + q3\n\n11\n\nq m+1 \u03c8n+1,m ,\n\n\f\u03c0(x\u22171 )\u03c8n,m\n\n= r\n\n\u03c0(x2 )\u03c8n,m = r\n\u03c0(x\u22172 )\u03c8n,m\n\n= r\n\ns\n\n1 \u2212 q 2n m+1\nq\n\u03c8n\u22121,m ,\n1 + q3\n\nv\nu\nu 1 \u2212 q 2(m+1)\nt\n\n1 + q3\n\ns\n\n\u03c8n,m+1 ,\n\n1 \u2212 q 2m\n\u03c8n,m\u22121 .\n1 + q3\n\n(5.1)\n\nWe notice that for q < 1 any power of the operator \u03c0(x0 ) is a trace class operator while\nthis is not the case for the operators \u03c0(x1 ), \u03c0(x\u22171 ), \u03c0(x2 ) and \u03c0(x\u22172 ) nor for any of their\npowers. Were this not the case there would be a contradiction with the algebra relations\n(3.9). A detailed analysis of the previous representations will be reported somewhere else.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nG.L. thanks Genevi\u00e8ve for her wonderful hospitality at the M-PSC in Orsay where this\nwork initiated.
