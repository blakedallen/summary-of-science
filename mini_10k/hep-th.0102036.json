It is completely integrable many-body Hamiltonian system describing a one-dimensional n-particle system with pairwise interaction. The study has lead\nto fascinating mathematics and application from lattice models in statistics physics[4, 5], to\nthe field theory and gauge theory [6]. e.g. to the Seiberg-Witten theory[7] etc. For a review\nsee [8, 9, 10], and references therein.\nRecently, the Lax pairs for the CM models in various root system have been constructed\nby Olshanetsky and Perelomov[11] using reduction on symmetric space, further given by\nInozemtsev in [12]. Afterwards, D'Hoker and Phong[13] succeeded in constructing the Lax\npairs with spectral parameter for each of the finite dimensional Lie algebra, as well as the\nintroduction of untwisted and twisted Calogero-Moser systems. Bordner et al [14, 15, 16]\ngive two types universal realization for the Lax pairs associated to all of the Lie algebra:\nthe root type and the minimal type, with and without spectral parameters. Even for all of\nthe Coxeter group, the construction has been obtained in [17]. All of them do not apply the\nreduction method for under which condition one will confront some obstruction[18] but using\npure Lie algebra construction. In [18], Hurtubise and Markman utilize so called \"structure\ngroup\", which combines semi-simple group and Weyl group, to construct the CM systems\nassociate with Hitchin system, which in some degree generalizes the results of Refs. [13, 14,\n15, 16, 17]. Furthermore, the quantum version of the generalization have been developed in\n[19, 20] at least for degenerate potentials of trigonometric after the works of Olshanetsky\nand Perelomov[21].\nSo far as for the RS model, only the Lax pair of the AN \u22121 type RS model was obtained\n[2, 5, 22, 23, 24, 25] and succeeded in recovering it by applying Hamiltonian reduction\nprocedure on two-dimensional current group [26]. Although the commutative operators for\nRS model based on various type Lie algebra have been given by Komori and co-workers [27],\nDiejen[28, 29] and Hasegawa et al [4, 30], the Lax integrability (or the Lax representation)\nof the other type RS model is still an open problem[7].\nIn recent work of Refs. [31] and [32], we have succeeded in constructing the Lax pairs\nfor the rational and trigonometric Cn and BCn RS systems. Following that, the r-matrix\nstructure for them have been derived by Avan et al in [33]. Moreover we give the more\ngeneral elliptic Cn and BCn RS systems in [34] and calculate their spectral curves. In\nthis paper, we concentrate on generalizing the construction to the Dn \u2212type trigonometric\nRuijsenaars-Schneider model. It turns out that there surely exists a Lax pair for this system.\nBy revealing the symmetry property of this model, we shall give a general form of the Lax\npair for generic n and verify its rationality at least for small n such as n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Its\nintegrability in Liouville sense is also depicted by giving n involutive integrals of motion.\nWe also perform its non-relativistic limit that coincides exactly with the previous known\nresult for the Dn Calogero-Moser system. The rational degeneration of this system is also\nremarked.\n2\n\n\fThe paper is organized as follows. The basic materials of the Dn RS model are introduced\nin Section 2, where we propose a self-consistent dynamical system associating with the root\nsystem of Dn . This includes construction of Hamiltonian for the Dn RS system together\nwith its symmetry analysis etc. The main results are showed in Sections 3. In Section 3,\nwe present a Lax pair and obtain an explicit general form for the Lax pair by imposing\nsome additional symmetry constraints. Section 4 is devoted to deriving the non-relativistic\ncounterpart, the Calogero-Moser model. Following is some remarks for the degenerate limit\nof rational case. We conclude with some remarks on our constructions in the last section.\n\n2\n\nModel and equations of motion\n\nLet us first review the basic materials about the Dn RS model. Though much progress have\nbeen made for generalization about the RS model[3, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34], there is no any result\nfor the system which associates with the root system of Dn . Even up to now we do not know\nhow to define its Hamiltonian. But now we will give a reasonable definition for this system\nwhich will be seen later.\nIn terms of the canonical variables pi , xi (i, j = 1, . . . , n) enjoying in the canonical Poisson\nbracket\n{pi , pj } = {xi , xj } = 0,\n{xi , pj } = \u03b4ij ,\n(2.1)\nwe give firstly the Hamiltonian of Dn RS system\nn\nn\nn \u0010\n\u0011\nY\nY\nX\n\u2212pi\npi\n(g(xik )g(xi + xk )) ,\n(f (xik )f (xi + xk )) + e\ne\nH=\ni=1\n\n(2.2)\n\nk6=i\n\nk6=i\n\nwhere\nsin(x \u2212 \u03b3)\n,\nsin(x)\ng(x) : = f (x)|\u03b3\u2192\u2212\u03b3 ,\n\nf (x) : =\n\nxik := xi \u2212 xk ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nand \u03b3 denotes the coupling constant. Then the canonical equations of motion could be\n\u2032\n\n\u1e8bi = {xi , H} = epi bi \u2212 e\u2212pi bi ,\nn \u0010\nX\nepj bj (h(xji ) \u2212 h(xj + xi ))\n\u1e57i = {pi , H} =\nj6=i\n\n\u2032\n\n+e\u2212pj bj (\u0125(xji ) \u2212 \u0125(xj + xi ))\npi\n\n\u2212e bi\n\nn\n\u0010X\n\u2032\n\n\u2212e\u2212pi bi\n\n\u0011\n\n(h(xij ) + h(xi + xj ))\n\nj6=i\nn\n\u0010X\nj6=i\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n(\u0125(xij ) + \u0125(xi + xj )) ,\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fwhere\nh(x) :=\nbi\n\u2032\n\nd ln g(x)\nd ln f (x)\n,\n\u0125(x) :=\n,\ndx\ndx\nn \u0010\n\u0011\nY\nf (xi \u2212 xk )f (xi + xk ) ,\n=\n\nbi =\n\nk6=i\nn \u0010\nY\nk6=i\n\n\u0011\ng(xi \u2212 xk )g(xi + xk ) .\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere, of course xi = xi (t), pi = pi (t) and the superimposed dot denotes t-differentiation.\nFor the convenience of analysis of symmetry, let us first give vector representation of Dn\nLie algebra. Introducing an n\u2212dimensional orthonormal basis of Rn ,\nej * ek = \u03b4j,k ,\n\nj, k = 1, 2, . . . , n,\n\n(2.7)\n\nthen the sets of roots \u2206 and vector weights \u039b of Dn are:\n\u2206 = {\u00b1(ej \u2212 ek ), \u00b1(ej + ek ) : j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n and j < k},\n\u039b = {ej , \u2212ej : j = 1, 2, . . . , n }.\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\nThe dynamical variables are canonical coordinates {xj } and their canonical conjugate momenta {pj } with the Poisson brackets of Eq.( 2.1). In a general sense, we denote them by n\ndimensional vectors x and p,\nx = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Rn ,\n\np = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) \u2208 Rn .\n\nSo that the scalar products of x and p with the roots \u03b1 * x, p * \u03b2, etc. can be defined. The\nHamiltonian of Eq.(2.2) can be rewritten as\n!\nY\nY\n1X\nH=\nexp (\u03bc * p)\nf (\u03b2 * x)+ exp (\u2212\u03bc * p)\ng(\u03b2 * x) ,\n(2.10)\n2 \u03bc\u2208\u039b\n\u2206\u220b\u03b2=\u03bc\u2212\u03bd\n\u2206\u220b\u03b2=\u2212\u03bc+\u03bd\n\nHere, the condition \u2206 \u220b \u03b2 = \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd means that the summation is over roots \u03b2 such that for\n\u2203\u03bd \u2208 \u039b\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd = \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206.\n(2.11)\nSo does for \u2206 \u220b \u03b2 = \u2212\u03bc + \u03bd.\nFrom the above-mentioned data, we can see that the definition for the Hamiltonian is\nreasonable and well-defined whose form Eq.(2.2) or Eq.(2.10) is similar to the one given in\n[31, 32, 34].\n\n3\n\nConstruction of the Lax pair\n\nIn this section, we concentrate our treatment to the explicit form of the Lax pair for the Dn\nRS system.

We give one explicit form\nof the Lax pair for small n such as 2, 3, 4 and show the involutive Hamiltonians could be\ngenerated by the corresponding Lax matrix. For generic n we have constructed the Lax pair\nand given a general form for it though lacking of a complete proof. But its correctness could\nbe checked at least for 2 \u2264 n \u2264 6. In the nonrelativistic limit, this system naturally leads to\nwell known Calogero-Moser system associated with the root system of Dn .\nActually, our original aim is to expand our constructions to the dynamical systems associated with all of the root systems. As suggested in [35] and [26], An\u22121 RS model appeared\nin the Hamiltonian reduction procedure applied to the cotangent bundle over centrally extended current group while the cotangent bundle over the centrally extended current algebra\nwas used to obtain the elliptic Calogero-Moser model[36, 37]. It is natural to expect similar\nresults to other root systems. Unfortunately, we fail in the corresponding constructions for\nthe systems associated with the root systems other than An\u22121 . In fact, as was analyzed\nin [18], there are several obstructions to extend the constructions. Alternatively, they used\nthe so-called \"structure group\", which related to Weyl reflections, to process symplectic reduction to construct the CM systems associate with Hitchin system where the embedding\nwas not even a group but a semi-direct product of groups. Moreover, one has the BCn\nCM and RS systems but they do not even correspond to groups. So the more general and\nelegant method to universal construction for the RS systems must combine all of characters\nappeared in previous results and get over the obstructions mentioned above.\nOn the other hand, a more concrete method is to use pure algebraic construction, which\nhas made great success for CM systems[13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In the present paper, we try to\nfollowing this idea and work out partial result for Dn RS system where some formulas such\nas Eq.(3.6), (3.9) have revealed some characters of Weyl reflections. Though we haven't obtained universal description of this system, we hope these results would reveal some essential\n12\n\n\fingredient for its integrability and shed some light on universal characters for generic RS\nsystems. At the same time, we address it an interesting aspect that the reduction procedure\nof using \"structure group\" corresponding to RS systems and fixing certain momentum map\nsuggested in [38, 18] may be a potential method to accomplish the complete generalization\nfor RS systems associated with all of simple Lie algebra and even to all of root systems.\nMoreover, the issue for getting the r-matrix structure for this model is deserved due to the\nsuccess of calculation for the trigonometric BCn RS system by Avan et al in [33].\n\nAcknowledgement\nOne of the authors K.
