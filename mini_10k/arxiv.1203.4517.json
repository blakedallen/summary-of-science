Several attempts have been made to justified the\ncurrent accelerated expansion of the universe [6, 7, 8, 9, 11]. One is the\npresentation of an unknown energy form which is called dark energy. An\nalternative approach is the modification of the gravitational theory e.g. f (R)\ngravity in which f (R) is an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature R\n[6, 13, 15]. Recent various observational data imply that the density of\nmatter (ordinary matter + dark matter+ radiation), \u03a9m = 0.27 and the\ndensity of dark energy, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 have capable value today (coincidence\nproblem), beside based on recent data, the equation of state parameter may\nevolve from \u03c9 > \u22121 (non-phantom phase) in the past to \u03c9 < \u22121 (phantom\none) at the present epoch. One way to explain these data, is to consider\ndynamical dark energy with proper interaction with matter[16].\nIn the quantum field theory \u03c1\u039b is regarded as zero-point energy density and\ndefined based on L, the size of the current universe, (dubbed the holographic\ndark energy ) as follow\n\u03c1\u039b = 3c2 Mp2 L\u22122 ,\n(1)\n\u221a\nwhere c2 is a numerical constant of order unity and Mp = 1/ 8\u03c0G is the\nreduced Planck mass where G is the Newtonian gravitational constant. Different choices may be adopted for the infrared cutoff of the universe, e.g.,\nHubble horizon, particle horizon, future event horizon [17]. In a non interaction model, if we take the particle horizon as the infrared cutoff, the\naccelerated expansion of universe cannot be explained[18], and if the Hubble horizon does chooses as the cutoff, then an appropriate equation of state\nparameter for dark matter cannot be derived [19]. By taking, the future\nevent horizon as the cutoff, the present expansion of universe may be explained but the coincidence problem still remains unsolved. This problem\nmay be alleviated by considering suitable interaction between dark matter\nand holigraphic dark energy.\nIn this paper, we consider a flat friedmann-Robertson- Walker universe and\nassume that the universe is composed of two interacting perfect fluids, the\nholographic dark energy and the matter. We assume the infrared cutoff\nto be a combination of the future and particle event horizon. After some\ngeneral debate about the properties of the model, we discuss the required\nconditions needed to cross the phantom divide line in the f (R) model. We\nshow that this crossing imposes some relations between the parameters of\nthe model.\n2\n\n\fIn this paper we well review f (R) model of gravity and make a correspondence between f (R) model and an interacting holographic dark energy\nmodel. By investigating the conditions which are needed for describing the\npresent universe, we can obtain a viable f (R) model of gravity.\n\n2\n\nDescription and general properties of the model\n\nThe equation of motion for the f (R) model is\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd f \u2032 \u2212 f g\u03bc\u03bd + (g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003 \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd ) f \u2032 = 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a prime represents the derivative with respect to the curvature scalar\nR and \u0003 is the covariant D'Alembert operator (\u0003 \u2261 \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 ). We will assume\ndark energy and cold dark matter perfect fluids with stress-energy tensor\ngiven by\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd p + (\u03c1 + p) u\u03bc u\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and p are the energy density and pressure of the fluid and u\u03bc =\n(1, 0, 0, 0) is its normalized four-velocity in co-moving coordinates. The dark\nenergy component has pressure pd and energy density \u03c1d and the cold dark\nmatter component has zero pressure and energy density \u03c1m . The stressenergy tensor is covariantly conserved.\nThe trace of equation (2) gives an equation of motion for the new scalar\ndegree of freedom (compared to Einsteinian general relativity), [20, 21],\n3\u0003f \u2032 = 8\u03c0GT + 2f \u2212 Rf \u2032 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the trace of the stress-energy tensor. It is helpful to redefine the\nscalar degree of freedom through\n\u03c6 = f \u2032 \u2212 1.\n\n(5)\n\nThen Eq. (4) can be reexpressed as an equation of motion for a canonical\ndimensionless scalar field \u03c6 with a force term F and potential V ,\n\u2032\n\n\u0003\u03c6 = V \u2032 (\u03c6) \u2212 F,\n\u2032\n\n3V (\u03c6) = 2f \u2212 Rf l7,\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere the force term that drives the scalar field \u03c6 is proportional to the\ntrace of the stress-energy tensor, F = \u22128\u03c0GT /3.\n3\n\n\fNow we consider a homogeneous and spatially-flat spacetime with FLRW\nline element\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)(dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ),\n(8)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor. The tt component of the gravitational equations (2), for the metric (8), can be simplified to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001 1 f \u2212 Rf \u2032\nd\n8\u03c0G\n2\n\u2032\nH +H\nln f \u2212\n\u03c1m .\n(9)\n=\n\u2032\ndt\n6\nf\n3f \u2032\nThe Friedmann equation, (6), can be written in a somewhat more conventional form as\n8\u03c0G\n(\u03c1m + \u03c1d ) ,\n(10)\nH2 =\n3 (1 + \u03c6)\n\nwhere we assume that the new scalar degree of freedom behaves like dark\nenergy with dark energy density\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nd(ln f \u2032 ) 1 f \u2212 Rf \u2032\n3 (1 + \u03c6)\n\u2212\n.\n(11)\nH\n\u03c1d = \u2212\n8\u03c0G\ndt\n6\nf\u2032\nAlso, one can write the Friedmann equation as\n\u03a9m + \u03a9d = 1,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the density parameters \u03a9m = \u03c1m /\u03c1c , \u03a9d = \u03c1d /\u03c1c , and the critical\nenergy density is\n3H 2 (1 + \u03c6)\n.\n(13)\nl13\u03c1c =\n8\u03c0G\nFrom the Friedmann equation (10) and conservation of stress-energy\ntensor, we have\n\u1e22 = \u2212\n\n4\u03c0G (\u03c1t + pd )\n\u03c6\u0307H\n\u2212\n,\n1+\u03c6\n2(1 + \u03c6)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c1t = \u03c1m + \u03c1d . The vanishing of the covariant divergence of the stressenergy tensor for the whole system gives the conservation equation in the\nmetric (8),\n\u03c1\u0307t + 3H (\u03c1t + pd ) = 0.\n\n(15)\n\nBut, because of interactions between the two components, each individual\ncomponent is not necessarily conserved. So, one can write\n\u03c1 \u0307d + 3H (\u03c1d + pd ) = \u2212Q,\n\n\u03c1 \u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = Q.l17\n4\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\n\fWe consider different forms of Q below. A number of different models have\nbeen proposed for dark energy. Here we want to investigate the holographic\ndark energy model and see if it can be related to the f (R) model. Holographic dark energy is described in terms of an infrared cut-off length, L,\nand the energy density is defined as\nl18\u03c1d =\n\n3c2 Mp2\n.\nL2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere c2 is a constant of order unity and Mp is the Plank mass. This is\nmotivated by quantum theory of gravity considerations, in particular the\nholographic principle [18, 19, 25]. It was shown in [26] that in quantum field\ntheory the UV cutoff \u039b should be related to the IR cutoff L due to a limit\nset by forming a black hole with Schwarzschild radius L. If \u03c1d = \u039b4 is the\nvacuum energy density of the UV cut-off scale, the total energy in volume L3\nshould not exceed the mass of the system-size black hole. This means that\nL3 \u03c1d \u2264 Mp2 L. So for the largest cut-off L, one can define the holographic\ndark energy as (??). From Eqs. (??) and (??), the density parameter of\nholographic dark energy can written as\n\u03a9d =\n\nc2\n.\n(1 + \u03c6) H 2 L2\n\n(19)\n\nThe IR cut-off, L, is presumably determined by the available length\nscale. To retain generality, we assume that it is a linear combination of the\nparticle horizon, Rp , and the future event horizon, Rf , i.e., we choose L to\nbe\nL = \u03b1Rf + \u03b2Rp ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\nRf = a(t)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nt\n\ndt\n,\na(t)\n\nRp = a(t)\n\nZ\n\nt\ntmin\n\ndt\n,\na(t)\n\n(21)\n\nhere tmin is the time when the particle was created, and 0 6 \u03b1, \u03b2 6 1 and\n\u03b1+\u03b2 = 1. For \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 0 we get L = Rf while \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 = 1 gives L = Rp .\nTaking the time derivative of (??), and using (16), one can obtain the\nequation of state parameter \u03c9d = pd /\u03c1d ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\nQ\nl22\u03c9d = \u2212 1 +\n\u2212\n.\n(22)\n3\nH\u03c1d\nHL\n5\n\n\fTo progress, we have to specify the interaction term Q. A generic form of\nQ is not available. Three forms which are often discussed in the literature\nare Q = 3b2 H\u03c1d , 3b2 H\u03c1m , 3b2 H\u03c1t , where b2 is a constant which has to be\npositive, because following the second law of thermodynamic, energy transfer\ncan only be from dark energy to cold dark mater. These three forms of\ninteraction give almost the same result, so for definiteness, we choose\nl23Q = 3b2 H\u03c1d .\nUsing (19), (??) and (??), we find\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) p\n2\nl24\u03c9d = \u2212 1 + 3b \u2212\n(1 + \u03c6)\u03a9d .\n3\nc\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, observational data indicate that the\ncurrent cosmological expansion is accelerating. In the fluid model this accelerated expansion requires \u03c9d < \u22121/3. This constraint results in\nl25\n\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) p\n(1 + \u03c6)\u03a9d < 3b2 .\nc\n\n(25)\n\nDefining a positive constant 0 < k0 < 1, we can rewrite (??) as\nl26\n\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) p\n(1 + \u03c6)\u03a9d = 3k0 b2 .\nc\n\n(26)\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics requires that the entropy S increasing\nwith time then, \u1e60 > 0. We assume S is the entropy attribute to the surface\narea A = 4\u03c0L2 , where L is the infrared cut-off length appearing in (??).\nAlso, making use of Nother charge method, one can obtain the entropy in\nthe f (R) model of gravity for a horizon with surface A = 4\u03c0L2 as [23]\nS=\n\nAf \u2032 (R)\n= \u03c0L2 (1 + \u03c6),\n4\n\n(27)\n\nThen, considering the thermodynamics second law, the time derivative of\nentropy, S, should be\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u1e60\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\u03c6\u0307\nl28 2 = 2H +\n+\n\u2265 0.\n(28)\n\u03c0L\n1+\u03c6\nL\nWe set (??) as\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u03c6\u0307\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\nl29 2H +\n+\n= s0 ,\n1+\u03c6\nL\n6\n\n(29)\n\n\fwhere 0 \u2264 s0 . s0 = 0 is when the accelerating expansion of the horizon of\nuniverse be adiabatic. Here we assume s0 > 0 and then\nl30\n\n\u03c6\u0307\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n= s0 \u2212\n\u2212 2,\nHL\nH(1 + \u03c6)\n\n(30)\n\nBy making use of (??) and (?? ), we have\nl31\n\n\u03c6\u0307\n= s0 \u2212 3k0 b2 \u2212 2 = \u03b80 ,\nH(1 + \u03c6)\n\n(31)\n\nOn the other hand, based on recent data, the dark energy component\nseems to have an equation of state parameter \u03c9d < \u22121 at the present epoch,\nwhile \u03c9d > \u22121 in the past [24]. Therefore, we expect the equation of state\nparameter cross the phantom divide line, then when \u03c9 = \u22121, the crossing\nis allowed. So by implying the phantom crossing line constraint on \u03c9, (??),\nwe have\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n= 3b2 \u2212 2.\n(32)\nl32\nHL\nFrom (??) and (??) we have\nl330 < k0 = 1 \u2212\n\n2\n< 1,\n3b2\n\n(33)\n\nthis show that 0 < 2/3b2 < 1. This means that one of the constant can be\nomit. Moreover, to cross \u03c9d = \u22121, \u03c9\u0307d must be negative at the transition\ntime, \u03c9d = \u22121. So by using (??) and time derivative of (??) we have\n\u0012\n\n\u1e22\n3\n+ b2\nl34\u03c9\u0307 = \u2212\n2\nH\n2\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n2\nb \u2212\n3\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n< 0.\n\n(34)\n\nFrom (??), we have b2 > 2/3, so that the relation (??) is satisfied when\nl35\n\n\u1e22\n3\n> \u2212 b2\n2\nH\n2\n\n(35)\n\nSo solving (??), gives\nl36H =\n\nh0\n,\n1 + h0 \u03b3t\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 3\u03be0 b2 /2, \u03be0 is an arbitrary constant which satisfy 0 < \u03be0 < 1\ncondition. We assume H0 t0 \u223c 1 (H0 and t0 are Hubble parameter in the\npresent time respectively) then h0 = H0 /(1 \u2212 \u03b3). By making use of (??)\n7\n\n\fand (??) we can easily find the scale factor of universe and the scalar field\n\u03c6 as\n1\n\nl37a(t) = a0 (1 + h0 \u03b3t) \u03b3 ,\n\n(37)\n\u03b80\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c6(t) = \u22121 + \u03c60 (1 + h0 \u03b3t) , l38\n\n(38)\n\nwhere a0 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)1/\u03b3 ( we assume that the scale factor in the present time\nis equal to 1, a(t0 ) = 1) and \u03c60 are the integration constants. It is clearly\nseen that, from (??), at the early time a(0) 6= 0 and then we have bouncing\nin the beginning of the universe. It is well known that the Rcci scalar in flat\nFLRW is as\n\u0002 \u00e4\n\u0227 \u0003\n(39)\nl39R = 6 + ( )2 ,\na\na\nthen\nR0\nl40R =\n,\n(40)\n(1 + h0 \u03b3t)2\nwhere R0 = 6h20 (1 \u2212 2\u03b3). So that using (5), (??) and (??), one can obtain a\nviable f (R), which allow the crossing from \u03c9 = \u22121, as\nl41f (R) = f0 + CR1\u2212\u01eb ,\n\n(41)\n\n\u03b8/2\u03b3\n\nhere C0 = \u03c60 R0 /\u01eb, \u01eb = \u03b8/2\u03b3 and f0 is the constant of integration which\ncan be as well as cosmological constant, \u039b. By making use of chameleon\nmechanism this kind of f (R) model has been studied in [27] and they show\nthat this form of f (R) model, is viable and satisfy the observational constraints solar system. Also using (??) and (??) one can rewrite (??) as\nl42V (\u03c6) = V0 + V1 \u03c6 +\n\nV2\n,\n(1 + \u03c6)2\u03b3\u03b8\n\n(42)\n\nwhere V0 is a constant of integration, V1 = 3f0 /2 and\n1\n\n\u01eb(1 + \u01eb)\u03c60\u01eb R0\nV2 =\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)(2\u01eb \u2212 1)\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nThe HDE model is an attempt for probing the nature of DE within the\nframework of quantum gravity [28]. In this work we used of HDE model\nwhich is in interaction with DM in the flat FLRW universe. We established\n8\n\n\fa correspondence between the interacting HDE model with the f (R) model\nof gravity in the flat FLRW universe. These correspondences are important to understand how different models which have been candidated for\nexplanting the present universe, are mutually related to each other. However, by taking account an infrared cutoff as a combination of particle and\nfuture event horizons and using the HDE energy density, we obtained the\nEoS parameter for the interacting HDE. Using equations derived for equation of state parameter of holographic dark energy and its time derivative,\ncondition required for crossing the phantom divide line was derived. Also\nthe condition of validity of thermodynamics second law for the infrared cutoff was obtained. Thus we studied the evolving behavior of the interacting\nHDE and implying some observational evidence such as, positive acceleration expansion of the universe (\u03c9 < \u22121/3 and q < 0), crossing the phantom\ndivide line (\u03c9 < \u22121) and validity os second law of thermodynamics for an\ninteracting model of HDE, we reconstructed the f (R) model which describe\naccelerated expansion of the universe. We also obtained the explicit evolutionary forms of the corresponding scalar fields, potential and scale factor\nof universe.\n\n4\n\nAknowledgement\n\nThe work of Kh.
