The regular orbits of a system of two\nmasses in Newtonian mechanics are of three types: ellipse, parabola and\nhyperbola. The latter two cases, in which the separation of two bodies will\nbecome infinite in the remote future, may be called open orbits. The singular\norbit is a linear one corresponding to a head-on collision, which is extremely\nspecial. In this paper, we consider regular orbits mentioned above: for a\nbinary system, the orbit determination may bring us some informations about\nits formation and evolution mechanism. In an open orbit, one may infer an\n2\n\n\fimpact parameter and an initial relative velocity of two masses, one of which\nmay be ejected by some explosive mechanism such as a supernova or by three\nbody scattering. For instance, some observations reveal that kicked pulsars\nmove at unusually high speed (Anderson et al. 1975, Hobbs et al. 2005).\nThe orbit determination of visual double stars was solved first by Savary\nin 1827, secondly by Encke 1832, thirdly by Herschel 1833 and by many\nauthors including Kowalsky, Thiele and Innes (Aitken 1964 for a review on\nearlier works; for the state-of-the-art techniques, e.g, Eichhorn and Xu 1990,\nCatovic and Olevic 1992, Olevic and Cvetkovic 2004). Here, a visual binary\nis a system of two stars both of which can be seen. The relative vector from\nthe primary star to the secondary is in an elliptic motion with a focus at\nthe primary. This relative vector is observable because the two stars are\nseen. On the other hand, an astrometric binary is a system of two objects\nwhere one object can be seen but the other cannot like a black hole or a\nvery dim star. In this case, it is impossible to directly measure the relative\nvector connecting the two objects, because one end of the separation of the\nbinary, namely the secondary, cannot be seen. The measures are made in\nthe position of the primary with respect to unrelated reference objects (e.g.,\na quasar) whose proper motion is either negligible or known.\n\n3\n\n\fAs a method to determine the orbital elements of a binary, an analytic\nsolution in an explicit form has been found by Asada, Akasaka and Kasai\n(2004, henceforth AAK). This solution is given in a closed form by requiring\nneither iterative nor numerical methods. One may naturally seek an analytic\nmethod of orbit determination for open orbits. An extension for open orbits\ndone earlier by Dommanget (1978) used the Thiele-Innes method, namely\nsolved numerically the Kepler equation. As a result, the method by Dommanget does not provide an explicit solution in a closed form. Therefore, let\nus extend the explicit solution by AAK to open orbits. Then, we would face\nthe following problem. AAK formalism uses a fact that the semimajor and\nsemiminor axes of an ellipse divide it into quarters. This fact plays a crucial\nrole in determining the position of the common center of mass on a celestial\nsphere; we should note here that the projected common center of mass is\nnot necessarily a focus of an apparent ellipse. The division into quarters is\npossible for neither a parabola nor a hyperbola.\nThe purpose of this paper is to generalize AAK approach so that we can\ntreat an open orbit. This paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 presents a\ngeneralized AAK formalism. In Sec. 3, the generalized approach is employed\nto obtain the method of orbit determination for a hyperbolic orbit. In Sec.\n\n4\n\n\f4, the formula for a parabolic orbit is presented. In Sec. 5, we recover these\nformulae by making a suitable transformation of that for an elliptic orbit\nwith some limiting procedures. Sec. 6 is devoted to Conclusion.\n\n2\n\nGeneralizing AAK formalism for an elliptic\nmotion\n\n2.1\n\nAn apparent ellipse\n\nWe denote by (x\u0304, \u0233) the Cartesian coordinates on a celestial sphere that is\nperpendicular to the line of sight. A general form of an ellipse on a celestial\nsphere is\n\u03b1x\u03042 + \u03b2 \u0233 2 + 2\u03b3 x\u0304\u0233 + 2\u03b4x\u0304 + 2\u03b5\u0233 = 1,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is characterized by five parameters; the position of its center, the length\nof its semimajor/semiminor axes and the rotational degree of freedom. By\nat least five measurements of the location of a star, one can determine all\nthe parameters. Henceforth, we adopt the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) such\nthat the apparent ellipse can be reexpressed in the standard form as\nx2 y 2\n+ 2 = 1,\na2\nb\n5\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere we assume a \u2265 b without loss of generality. The ellipticity, e, is\nq\n\n1 \u2212 b2 /a2 .\n\n2.2\n\nThe common center of mass\n\nA focus of the original Keplerian ellipse is not always that of the apparent one\nbecause of the inclination of the orbital plane. We should note that a focus of\nthe original Keplerian orbit is the common center of mass of a binary, around\nwhich a component star moves at the constant-areal velocity following the\nKeplerian second law (the conservation law of the angular momentum in the\nclassical mechanics). This enables us to find out the location of the common\ncenter of mass as shown below.\nA star is located at Pj = (xj , yj ) = (a cos uj , b sin uj ) on a celestial sphere\nat each epoch tj for j = 1, * * * , 4, where tj > tk for j > k. Here, uj denotes\nthe eccentric angle in the apparent ellipse but not the eccentric anomaly in\nthe true one; the eccentric anomaly of the original Keplerian orbit is not\nobservable. We assume anti-clockwise motion, such that uj > uk for j > k.\nAll we must do in the case of the clockwise motion is to change the signature\nof the area in Eq. (4) in the following. We define the time interval as\nT (j, k) = tj \u2212 tk .\n6\n\n\fThe common center of mass of the binary is projected onto the celestial\nsphere at PC = (xc , yc). Even after the projection, the law of constant-areal\nvelocity still holds, where we should note that the area is swept by the line\ninterval between the projected common center and the star. The area swept\nduring the time interval, T (j, k), is denoted by S(j, k). The total area of\nthe observed ellipse is denoted by S = \u03c0ab. The law of the constant areal\nvelocity on the celestial sphere becomes\nS\nS(j, k)\n=\n,\nT\nT (j, k)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\ni\n1 h\nxc\nyc\nS(j, k) = ab uj \u2212 uk \u2212 (sin uj \u2212 sin uk ) + (cos uj \u2212 cos uk ) .\n2\na\nb\n\n(4)\n\nEquation (3) is rewritten explicitly as\nS(2, 1)\nS(3, 2)\n=\n,\nT (2, 1)\nT (3, 2)\nS(4, 3)\nS(3, 2)\n=\n.\nT (3, 2)\nT (4, 3)\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThey are solved for xc and yc as\nB1 C2 \u2212 B2 C1\n,\nA1 B2 \u2212 A2 B1\nC1 A2 \u2212 C2 A1\nyc = b\n,\nA1 B2 \u2212 A2 B1\n\nxc = \u2212a\n\n7\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\fwhere\nAj = T (j + 1, j) sin uj+2 + T (j + 2, j + 1) sin uj\n\u2212T (j + 2, j) sin uj+1,\n\n(9)\n\nBj = T (j + 1, j) cos uj+2 + T (j + 2, j + 1) cos uj\n\u2212T (j + 2, j) cos uj+1,\n\n(10)\n\nCj = T (j + 1, j)uj+2 + T (j + 2, j + 1)uj \u2212 T (j + 2, j)uj+1.\n\n(11)\n\nThe periastron is projected onto the observed ellipse at PA \u2261 (xA , yA) =\n(a cos uA , b sin uA). The ratio of the semimajor axis to the distance between\nthe center and the focus of the ellipse remains unchanged, even after the\nprojection. Hence, we find\n1\nP .\neK C\n\nPA =\n\n(12)\n\nThe positional vector PA is still located on the apparent ellipse given by Eq.\n(2). We thus obtain the ellipticity as\neK =\n\n2.3\n\ns\n\nx2c yc2\n+ 2.\na2\nb\n\n(13)\n\nProjection onto a celestial sphere\n\nIn the original derivation of AAK formula, the fact that the semimajor and\nsemiminor axes divide the area of the ellipse in quarters. This still holds\n8\n\n\feven after the projection. Namely the projected semimajor and semiminor\naxes divide the area of the apparent ellipse in quarters, though the original\nsemimajor and semiminor axes are not always projected onto the apparent\nsemimajor and semiminor ones. This way of the derivation, however, can be\nused for neither hyperbolic nor parabolic cases, where there are no counterparts of the semiminor axis. Hence we shall employ another method.\nIn this paragraph, we use the Cartesian coordinates (X, Y ) on the original\norbital plane. Let i be the inclination angle between the original orbital\nplane and the celestial sphere. We define as \u03c9 the angular distance of the\nperiastron, namely the angle between the periastron and the ascending node.\nLet us express the original Keplerian ellipse as\nX2 Y 2\n+\n= 1.\na2K b2K\n\n(14)\n\nWe consider the line that is perpendicular to the semimajor axis at a focus\n(aK eK , 0). This line intersects the original ellipse at points Q = (aK eK , aK (1\u2212\ne2K )) and R = (aK eK , \u2212aK (1 \u2212 e2K )). For later convenience, we adopt the\ncoordinates (X\u0304, \u0232 ) whose origin is located at the focus, by making a translation as X\u0304 = X \u2212 aK eK . Then, one rewrites Q = (0, aK (1 \u2212 e2K )) and\nR = (0, \u2212aK (1 \u2212 e2K )).\nOnly in this paragraph, we adopt other Cartesian coordinates (x\u2032 , y \u2032) so\n9\n\n\fthat the ascending node can be located on the x\u2032 -axis and the origin can be\nthe common center of mass. The true periastron of the original ellipse is pro\u2032\njected at PA \u2261 (x\u2032A , yA\n) = aK (1\u2212eK )(cos \u03c9, sin \u03c9 cos i). The point denoted\n\u2032\nby Q is projected at PQ \u2261 (x\u2032Q , yQ\n) = aK (1 \u2212 e2K )(\u2212 sin \u03c9, cos \u03c9 cos i). It\n\nis useful to consider the following invariants because the components of a\nvector depend on the adopted coordinates.\n|PA|2 = a2K (1 \u2212 eK )2 (cos2 \u03c9 + sin2 \u03c9 cos2 i),\n\n(15)\n\n|PQ |2 = a2K (1 \u2212 e2K )2 (sin2 \u03c9 + cos2 \u03c9 cos2 i),\n\n(16)\n\n|PA \u00d7 PQ | = a2K (1 + eK )(1 \u2212 eK )2 cos i.\n\n(17)\n\nWe consider the area surrounded by the ellipse and the line interval between Q and R. This area is divided into equal halves by the semimajor axis.\nEven after the projection, the divided areas are still equal halves. Hence one\ncan determine the location of the projected Q as\n!\n\nayc s\nbxc s\nPQ = xc \u2212\n,\n, yc +\nb\na\n\n(18)\n\nin the apparent ellipse coordinates, where we defined\ns=\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 e2K\neK\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nIn this computation, it is useful to stretch the apparent ellipse along its\nsemiminor axis by a/b so that one can consider a circle with radius a. In\n10\n\n\fthis stretching, importantly, the areal division into equal halves still holds.\nWe make a translation as x \u2192 x \u2212 xc and y \u2192 y \u2212 yc so that the projected\ncommon center of mass can become the origin of the new coordinates.

It is\nworthwhile to mention that Eq. (25) is obtained by solving a quadratic\nequation for cos i as\ncos2 i \u2212 \u03be cos i + 1 = 0,\n\n(30)\n\nwhich can be obtained from Eqs. (15)-(17) by eliminating \u03c9 and aK . Fur\u221a\nthermore, one can prove that a root of cos i = (\u03be + \u03be 2 \u2212 4)/2 must be\nabandoned because Eq. (29) implies that it is always larger than the unity.\nOnly in the case of i = 0, the apparent ellipse coincides with the true orbit.\nHence, the ascending node and consequently the angular distance of the periastron make no sense. As a result, the denominator of R. H. S. of Eq. (27)\nvanishes.\nEquations (13), (25), (26) and (27) agree with those of AAK, where different notations were employed. In this paper, the semiminor axis is not used\nfor areal divisions. Therefore, this formalism can be generalized straightforwardly to an open orbit, as shown below.\n12\n\n\f3\n\nThe solution for a hyperbolic orbit\n\n3.1\n\nAn apparent hyperbola\n\nLet a star move in a hyperbola on a celestial sphere.
