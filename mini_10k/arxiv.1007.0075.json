Introduction\nAt the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the top quark will be produced copiously. The\ncross section for the top-quark pair-production amounts to several hundred pb [1, 2, 3], and\norder 106 top-quark events will be observed each year if the LHC runs with 14 TeV collision\nenergy and achieves the designed luminosity. Collecting these top-quark events, detailed\nanalysis on the properties of the top quark will be possible, such as precise determinations\nof its mass and width, structure of electroweak and strong interactions, and its spin properties [4]. The current world average of the top-quark mass measurements from the combined\nanalysis of CDF and D0 collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron reads mt = 173.1 \u00b1 1.3\nGeV [5] (see also [6]). Furthermore, the top-quark production process is considered as a\nstandard candle process. Namely, it serves understanding detector performances, e.g. jet\nenergy calibrations, from comparisons of experimental measurements with theoretically reliable or well-controllable predictions, for observables including jet topologies, backgrounds\nand underlying events.\nThere have been many studies on top-quark production processes at the LHC.\u2217 Update\nanalyses on the total pair-production cross-section are presented in [1, 2, 3], including the\n\u2217\n\nSee e.g. [4, 18] for more complete review.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fnext-to-leading-order (NLO) correction [7, 8] and resummation of threshold logarithms [9,\n10, 11] in QCD. Differential distributions including decays of the top-quark have also been\nknown up to NLO [12, 13, 14], and various distributions are investigated in [15, 16, 17, 18,\n19].\nRecently, tt\u0304 invariant-mass (mtt\u0304 ) distribution near threshold has been investigated\nincorporating the bound-state effects [20, 21]. The effects are found to be significant at\nthe LHC, since (in contrast to the Tevatron) the gluon-fusion channel dominates the cross\nsection and there are significant contributions from (the remnant of) the color-singlet tt\u0304\nresonances.\nIn this paper we compute the fully differential cross sections for the top-quark pair\nproductions and their subsequent decays at the LHC. In particular, we incorporate the\nbound-state effects, which are important in the tt\u0304 threshold region, into the cross sections. We extend the studies of [20, 21] and present a theoretical frame to incorporate the\nbound-state effects to the differential cross sections. Using this result, we compute various\nkinematical distributions of the top quarks and their decay products at hadron colliders,\nby developing a Monte-Carlo (MC) event-generator incorporating the bound-state effects.\n(There exist similar MC event-generators for computing the top-quark cross-sections in the\ntt\u0304 threshold region at future e+ e\u2212 colliders [22, 23, 24].) Through the analysis, we elucidate the nature of the bound-state effects at various stages: at the partonic matrix-element\nlevel, both with and without including the decay of the top quark, and in the kinematical\ndistributions after incorporating the initial-state radiation (ISR) effects. Theoretically the\nfully differential cross sections contain more information on the bound-state effects than\njust the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution; for instance, it is known that the top momentum\ndistribution is sensitive to the resonance wave functions in momentum space [25, 26]. From\na practical point of view, the differential cross sections are useful for studying effects of\nvarious kinematical cuts, detector acceptance corrections, detector calibrations, etc.\nThe method for incorporating tt\u0304 bound-state effects has been developed mainly in the\nstudies of tt\u0304 productions in e+ e\u2212 collisions [27, 28, 29]. Formally, in the limit where we\nneglect the top-quark width, \u0393t \u2192 0, bound-state effects can be incorporated by resummation of the Coulomb singularities (\u03b1s /\u03b2)n , where \u03b2 is the velocity of the top quark in the\ntt\u0304 c.m. frame. In contrast to the e+ e\u2212 collision, at hadron colliders, tt\u0304 pairs are produced\nin both color-singlet and octet states, and the (partonic) collision energy is not fixed. Due\nto the latter reason, we have to set up a theoretical framework which is valid both in the\nthreshold region (mtt\u0304 \u2243 2mt ) and in the high-energy region (mtt\u0304 \u226b 2mt ). The former region is where the bound-state effects (Coulomb corrections) become significant and where\nthe non-relativistic approximation is valid. On the other hand, in the latter region, the\nbound-state effects are not significant and the top quarks are relativistic. We present a\nframework which takes into account all the leading-order (LO) corrections in both regions.\nNamely, we incorporate all the (\u03b1s /\u03b2)n terms in the threshold region, while we include\nall the \u03b2 n terms in the relativistic region. (Some of the important subleading corrections\nare also incorporated.) Furthermore, we interpolate the two regions smoothly in a natural\nway.\nAnother important aspect in computing the differential cross sections for the top-quark\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fproductions and decays is to construct full amplitudes corresponding to the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 final\nstate and to incorporate off-shellness of the top quarks appropriately [30]. The former is\nimportant to incorporate the polarizations of t and t\u0304 and angular correlations in their decay\nproducts. (In Appendix D, we will further discuss the polarizations of the W 's from the\ntop quarks.) The latter is intimately related to the former and is known to be particularly\nimportant in the threshold region. In the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 production, there are non-resonant\ndiagrams where bW + and b\u0304W \u2212 are not produced from the decay of t and t\u0304. Often the nonresonant diagrams are omitted in the studies of tt\u0304 productions, since they are suppressed in\nthe events where both t and t\u0304 are nearly on-shell. In the threshold region, however, either\nof t and t\u0304 tends to be off-shell due to restricted phase-space and the binding effects [25], and\nthe non-resonant diagrams can give non-negligible contributions compared to the resonant\n(tt\u0304) diagrams [31]. Since these contributions interfere with each other, all the diagrams have\nto be taken into account at the amplitude level. Moreover, because of the requirement by\nunitarity, we also have to ensure a consistent treatment of the finite decay width of the\ntop quark in our framework. We will discuss these points within our framework, which\nincludes the bound-state effects as well as the non-resonant diagrams, in connection with\na known problem regarding a gauge cancellation.\nIn order to compute numerically various kinematical distributions at hadron colliders,\nwe develop a MC event-generator, which is adapted to the MadEvent [32, 33] environment\u2020 .\nWe include the bound-state effects in the hard-scattering part of the LO event-generator, on\nthe basis of our theoretical framework. The ISR and/or final-state radiation (FSR), which\nare of importance at hadron colliders, are incorporated via the parton-shower approach.\nSince the parton shower does not alter the normalizations of the cross sections at the\npartonic level, we will complement the overall normalizations, known up to NLO [20, 21],\nby multiplying the cross sections in the individual channels with the so-called \"K-factors.\"\nWe note, however, that our aim here is to construct a generator valid only up to LO\nwith respect to the differential distributions, in this first attempt to include the boundstate effects. Compare with the existing NLO event-generators, such as MC@NLO [34, 35]\nand POWHEG [36], which realize a consistent treatment of perturbative corrections for any\nprocess and any phase-space point.\nUsing the generated events, we study the bound-state effects on the top quark differential distributions at the LHC, focusing on the events in a relatively low mtt\u0304 region. A tt\u0304\npair gains a binding energy due to exchange of Coulomb gluons between them. This effect\ntends either of t and t\u0304 to be off-shell below the threshold, and the effect remains even a few\ntens GeV above the threshold, due to the large width of the top quark. We will quantify\nthis picture through detailed examinations of the top quark differential distributions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we give a theoretical framework for\ncomputing the amplitudes for top-quark pair-production at hadron colliders, incorporating\nthe bound-state effects (Sec. 2.1), the finite width effects (Sec. 2.2), and the ISR effects\nand K-factors (Sec. 2.3). In Sec. 3, we present numerical studies for various kinematical\n\u2020\n\nThe Fortran code for the event generator including the bound-state corrections is available at\nhttp://madgraph.kek.jp/~yokoya/TopBS/.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fFigure 1: Feynman diagrams for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 and q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304 at the tree-level.\n\ndistributions in tt\u0304 production, using the MC simulation which implements the ingredients\nexplained in the previous section. In Sec. 4, we summarize our results. To avoid complexity\nin the main body of the paper, several detailed discussions are presented in the Appendices.\nIn App. A, we identify the tt\u0304 Green function in a Feynman amplitude. In App. B, we derive\nthe off-shell suppression factor. In App. C, the color decomposition of the amplitude is\nexplained. In App. D, we examine the leptonic decays of W 's from top quarks with and\nwithout spin correlations.\n\n2. Inclusion of Bound-state Effects\nIn this section we present a theoretical investigation of how to include the tt\u0304 bound-state\neffects in the matrix elements for gg \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 and q q\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 . In particular we\ninclude the effects such that the amplitude is correct in the leading-order approximation\nboth in the tt\u0304 threshold region and in the high energy region. Inclusion of several different\neffects is explained in steps: In Sec. 2.1 we explain how to incorporate the bound-state\neffects; in Sec. 2.2 important higher-order effects of the large top-quark decay-width are\nincorporated; in these subsections, we consider only the partonic S-matrix elements. In\nSec. 2.3 we incorporate the ISR effects and the K-factors in the corresponding partonic\ndifferential cross sections.\nFor later convenience, we divide each amplitude into two parts, the tt\u0304 (double-resonant)\npart and the non-resonant part, as\n(c)\n\n(c)\n(I \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) ,\nM(c) (I \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) = Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) + Mnr\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere I = gg or q q\u0304 represents initial-state partons, and c represents the color (c = 1 and\n8 for the singlet and octet, respectively) of I, or equivalently, of bb\u0304 in the final-state. The\nfirst term on the right-hand side represents the sum of the diagrams which contain both\nt and t\u0304 as an intermediate state. This part of the amplitude consists of I \u2192 tt\u0304 processes\nfollowed by subsequent decays of t and t\u0304. The second term represents the sum of the rest of\nthe diagrams, which consists of single(-top)-resonant diagrams and non-resonant diagrams.\nFig. 1 shows the tree-level Feynman diagrams for the processes gg \u2192 tt\u0304 and q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304. Some\nexamples of the tree-level diagrams included in each part for I = gg are shown in Fig. 2.\nIn general each part is gauge-dependent. In this paper, we work in Feynman gauge for\nSU (3)c and in unitary gauge for the broken electroweak symmetry.\nIn computing the tree-level Feynman diagrams which contain the top-quark propagators, we include the (on-shell) top-quark decay-width \u0393t in the propagator denominator\nas\ni(p/t + mt )\n.\n(2.2)\nSF (pt ) = 2\npt \u2212 m2t + imt \u0393t\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fFigure 2: Typical Feynman diagrams for the double-resonant (left), single-resonant (middle) and\n(c)\n(c)\nnon-resonant (right) contributions in the gg \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 process. They belong to Mtt\u0304 , Mnr and\n(c)\nMnr , respectively. The term \"resonant\" is used to refer to the t or t\u0304 quark propagator (shown with\ndouble line) which can become close to on-shell. The blob in the left diagram represents the first\nthree diagrams in Fig. 1.\n\n2.1 LO cross section valid from threshold to high energies\n(c)\n\nIn this subsection we include the bound-state effects in the tt\u0304 amplitude Mtt\u0304 . We consider\nthe narrow-width limit of top-quark width in this subsection. Namely, we take into account\nonly the leading contributions as \u0393t \u2192 0. Important subleading effects by the finite topquark width will be investigated separately in the next subsection.\nWe start by reviewing the conventional method for including the bound-state effects\nin the matrix element (or in the fully differential cross section) of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212\nclose to the threshold of tt\u0304 pair productions. At the leading-order, this is achieved by\nmultiplying the tree-level amplitude corresponding to the diagrams e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212\nby an enhancement factor as [25, 26]\u2021\nM(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) = M(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )tree\n\nG(1) (E + i\u0393t , p~)\n.\nG0 (E + i\u0393t , p~)\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere, the non-relativistic Green functions are defined by\u00a7\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u001b\u0015\n\u22072\n(c)\n(E + i\u0393t ) \u2212 \u2212\n+ VQCD (r) G\u0303(c) (E + i\u0393t , ~r) = \u03b43 (~r),\nmt\nZ\nG(c) (E + i\u0393t , p~) = d3~r e\u2212i~p*~r G\u0303(c) (E + i\u0393t , ~r) .\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u00d7\n\n(2.5)\n\n\u221a\nE = s\u22122mt is the c.m. energy measured from the threshold; mt is the pole mass of the top\nquark; ~r denotes the relative coordinate of t and t\u0304, while p~ denotes the three-momentum of\n(c)\nt (or minus the three-momentum of t\u0304), both defined in the c.m. frame; VQCD (r) is the QCD\npotential between the tt\u0304 pair in the color-singlet (c = 1) or color-octet (c = 8) channel. In\ne+ e\u2212 collisions, tt\u0304 pairs are produced in the color-singlet channel, hence c = 1 in Eq. (2.3).\nThe free non-relativistic Green function G0 (E + i\u0393t , p~) is obtained from G(c) (E + i\u0393t , p~) by\n\u2021\n\nThere are two tree-level diagrams for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 with \u03b3 and Z boson intermediate states.\nM(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )tree denotes the sum of them.\n\u00a7\nIn this study, G(c) (E + i\u0393t , p\n~) is computed numerically by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in coordinate space and taking Fourier transform [25]. Alternatively, one may solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in\nmomentum space directly [26].\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f(c)\n\nsetting VQCD (r) \u2192 0.

By definition, the above Green function\ncontains only the S-wave contributions.\nThere are two methods to compute the total cross section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212\nincorporating the bound-state effects. One way is to integrate the absolute square of the\nmatrix element given in Eq. (2.3) over the phase-space of the final bW + b\u0304W \u2212 state. The\nother method is to use the optical theorem (unitarity relation) and take the imaginary\npart of a current-current correlator (two-point function). At the leading-order, the latter\nmethod leads to the formula [27, 28]:\n\u03c3tot (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) = \u03c3tot (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304)tree\nh\ni\nIm G\u0303(1) (E + i\u0393t , ~r = ~0)\nh\ni\n,\n\u00d7\nIm G\u03030 (E, ~r = ~0)\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere the Green function in coordinate space is defined in Eq. (2.4). \u03c3tot (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304)tree\ndenotes the Born cross-section for the production of on-shell top quarks. Note that in the\ndenominator we set \u0393t to zero in G\u03030 , whereas \u0393t is retained in the denominator in Eq. (2.3).\nThe different treatment of \u0393t is because in Eq. (2.3) we use the tree-level amplitude with\nunstable top quarks (in the intermediate state), whereas in Eq. (2.7) we use the tree-level\ncross section of the on-shell top quarks (in the final state).\nBoth formulas (2.3) and (2.7) incorporate all the leading-order corrections \u223c (\u03b1s /\u03b2)n\nin the threshold region E \u226a mt . On the other hand, the formulas are not valid at higher\nn\nc.m. energies E >\n\u223c mt , since relativistic corrections \u223c \u03b2 , which grow with energy, are\nneglected in these formulas.\nNow we turn to the partonic cross sections for the top-quark productions in hadron\ncollisions, I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 with I = gg and q q\u0304. Unlike e+ e\u2212 collisions, the collision\nenergy of the initial state cannot be fixed. Thus, we need to consider both threshold and\nhigh-energy regions. The formulas which we propose, valid in both regions within the\nleading-order approximation, can be summarized as follows:\n(1) The tt\u0304 amplitude for I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 is given by\n(c)\n\n(c)\n\nMtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) = Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )tree\n\u00d7\n\nG(c) (E \u2032 + i\u0393t , p~)\n,\nG0 (E \u2032 + i\u0393t , p~)\n\n(2.8)\n\nwith\nE\u2032 = E +\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\nE2\n.\n4mt\n\n(2.9)\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe Feynman diagrams which contribute to the tree-level amplitude Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192\nbW + b\u0304W \u2212 )tree are those shown in Fig. 1, after attaching the decay vertices t \u2192 bW +\nand t\u0304 \u2192 b\u0304W \u2212 to each diagram. There are both color-singlet (c = 1) and color-octet\n(c = 8) channels in the case I = gg, while there is only the color-octet channel in the\ncase I = q q\u0304. Here, E is defined from the tt\u0304 invariant-mass mtt\u0304 as E = mtt\u0304 \u2212 2mt .\nThe only essential difference from the corresponding formula for the e+ e\u2212 collision,\nEq. (2.3), is the use of the modified energy E \u2032 [Eq. (2.9)] instead of E.\n(2) We may compute the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution by integrating the absolute square\n(c)\nof the above amplitude |Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )|2 over the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 phase-space\nfor each fixed mtt\u0304 . Alternatively we may obtain the formula for the tt\u0304 invariantmass distribution using the optical theorem, similarly to the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 case. In the\nleading-order approximation, this reads\nh\ni\nIm G\u0303(c) (E \u2032 + i\u0393t , ~r = ~0)\n(c)\n(c)\nh\ni\n.\n\u03c3\u0302tot (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) = \u03c3\u0302tot (I \u2192 tt\u0304)tree \u00d7\nIm G\u03030 (E \u2032 , ~r = ~0)\n(2.10)\n\n(c)\n\nAs in the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 case, \u03c3\u0302tot (I \u2192 tt\u0304)tree is the Born cross-section for the on-shell\n\u0001\ntop quarks; accordingly \u0393t is set to zero in G\u03030 (E \u2032 , ~r = ~0 . We note that the tt\u0304\ninvariant-mass distribution obtained from Eq. (2.10) does not exactly coincide with\n(c)\nthat obtained by integrating |Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )|2 over the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 phasespace; the difference is O(\u0393t /mt ) and will be discussed in the next subsection.\nIn the following we sketch our theoretical consideration which led to the above formulas\n(2.8) and (2.10), where some details are relegated to App. A. As explained in that appendix,\npart of the Feynman amplitude for I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 can be identified with a Green\nfunction that dictates the time evolution of the tt\u0304 system. (Such an identification is possible\nin all kinematical regions.) In the c.m. frame of tt\u0304, for the initial-state | i i and final-state\n| f i of the tt\u0304 system, this Green function can be written formally as\u00b6\nhf |\n\n1\n|ii,\nmtt\u0304 \u2212 H + i\u0393t\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere mtt\u0304 is the c.m. energy of tt\u0304 (tt\u0304 invariant-mass). The full QCD Hamiltonian is denoted\nby H. Because of this property, the amplitude for I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 , which incorporates\nthe tt\u0304 bound-state effects, can be obtained from the tree-level amplitude by multiplying an\nenhancement factor:\n(c)\n\n\u00b6\n\n(c)\n\nMtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) \u2248 Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )tree\nD\nE\n1\np~\n~r = ~0\nmtt\u0304 \u2212 H + i\u0393t\n\u00d7D\nE.\n1\n~r = ~0\np~\nmtt\u0304 \u2212 H0 + i\u0393t\n\nAs already stated, treatment of the top-quark width is correct only in the leading order.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n(2.12)\n\n\fH0 denotes the Hamiltonian H after setting \u03b1s \u2192 0, i.e. the free Hamiltonian. As before,\n~r denotes the relative coordinate of t and t\u0304, while p~ denotes the three-momentum of t,\nboth defined in the c.m. frame of the tt\u0304 system. Corrections to Eq. (2.12), which come\nfrom the non-resonant part of the amplitude (i.e. that vanish as \u0393t \u2192 0), are neglected;\nsee Appendix A.\nIn the above equation, we have taken advantage of the fact that we work in the leadingorder approximation and set the initial-state of the Green functions as |~r = ~0i. This follows\nfrom the following consideration. Naively, the tt\u0304 system cannot be regarded as being created\nby contact interaction (i.e. at the same point ~r = ~0) in the t- and u-channel diagrams of\ngg \u2192 tt\u0304, in which the top-quark is exchanged between the initial gg (see Fig. 1). In the nonrelativistic region, however, we may set p~ \u2192 0 in the t- or u-channel top-quark propagator\nin the leading-order approximation. The denominator of the propagator effectively reduces\nto a constant close to the threshold, so that tt\u0304 can be regarded as being created at the same\npoint. On the other hand, in the relativistic region the enhancement factor in Eq. (2.12)\nreduces to 1 + O(\u03b1s ). Hence, it is justified to evaluate the Green functions with the initialstate |~r = ~0i within our present approximation.\nSince our aim is to include the leading-order contributions both in the relativistic\nand non-relativistic regions, the full form of the Hamiltonian is not necessary. In the\nregion where t and t\u0304 are relativistic, mtt\u0304 \u2212 2mt >\n\u223c mt , the leading-order contribution in the\nHamiltonian reads\nq\n(2.13)\nH = 2 p~ 2 + m2t + O(\u03b1s ) ,\n\nas shown in Appendix A. It is nothing but the sum of the energies of free on-shell t\nand t\u0304. The above equation also indicates how the next-to-leading order effects enter the\nHamiltonian. On the other hand, in the non-relativistic region, E = mtt\u0304 \u2212 2mt \u226a mt , the\nleading-order contributions in the Hamiltonian can be written explicitly as\n#\n\"\nh\ni\np2\n~\n(c)\n(2.14)\n+ VQCD (r) \u00d7 1 + O(\u03b1s , \u03b2) .\nH = 2mt +\nmt\n\nIt is indicated that the next-to-leading order corrections enter as O(\u03b2) relativistic corrections or O(\u03b1s ) corrections.\nA natural choice of the Hamiltonian, which incorporates the leading-order contributions in both regions and smoothly interpolates these regions, is given by\nq\n(c)\n(2.15)\nHLO = 2 p~ 2 + m2t + VQCD (r).\n\nIn fact, it is well known that, when computing higher-order corrections in Coulombic\nbound-state problems, part of them (relativistic corrections) contribute exactly in the above\nform [37]. Thus, in principle, one may determine the enhancement factor in Eq. (2.12) using\nthe above Hamiltonian.\nDue to technical reasons, however, we use an alternative form of the enhancement\nfactor, which is equivalent within the present approximation. By substituting E = mtt\u0304 \u2212\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f2mt to the on-shell relation\nq\nmtt\u0304 = 2 p~ 2 + m2t ,\n\none finds that\n\nE+\n\n(2.16)\n\n~p 2\nE2\n=\n.\n4mt\nmt\n\n(2.17)\n\nTherefore, if we define\n\u0001 D\nG(c) E \u2032 + i\u0393t , p~ = p\n~\n\n1\n(c)\n\nE \u2032 + i\u0393t \u2212 (~\np 2 /mt + VQCD (r))\n\n~r = ~0\n\nE\n\n(2.18)\n\nwith E \u2032 defined by Eq. (2.9), the position of the pole of G(c) (E \u2032 + i\u0393t , p~) is the same as that\nof h~\np|(mtt\u0304 \u2212 HLO + i\u0393t )\u22121 |~r = ~0i in the limit \u03b1s \u2192 0. Furthermore, in the non-relativistic\nregion, evidently G(c) (E \u2032 , p~) is the same as h~\np|(mtt\u0304 \u2212 HLO + i\u0393t )\u22121 |~r = ~0i in the leadingorder approximation. Hence, we may compute the matrix element by the formula Eq. (2.8).\nOne may be worried that, although the replacement E \u2192 E \u2032 correctly accounts for the\npole position, the residue of the pole may be altered significantly from that of Eq. (2.12) in\nthe relativistic region. This is not the case, since the change of the residue will be canceled\nin the ratios of the Green functions in Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10).\nThe advantage of using G(c) (E \u2032 + i\u0393t , p~) is that one can obtain it from the conventional\nnon-relativistic Green function with a minimal modification E \u2192 E \u2032 = E + E 2 /(4mt ). In\nparticular, properties of G(c) are fairly well known.\nLet us comment on the dependence of the Green function on the top-quark width \u0393t in\nEq. (2.18). In Eq. (2.2) the shift of the pole position of the top-quark propagator due to the\nfinite top-quark width can be incorporated simply by a replacement m2t \u2192 m2t \u2212 imt \u0393t . If\nwe apply it to Eq. (2.16), one finds that i\u0393t will be added to the left-hand side of Eq. (2.17).\nHence, inclusion of \u0393t as in Eq. (2.18) is correct in the leading-order approximation.\nThroughout our analysis, we include an important subleading correction to the boundstate effects, in order to make our analysis more realistic. This is the NLO (1-loop) cor(c)\nrection to the static potentials VQCD (r) between the tt\u0304 pair. The NLO potential reads [38]\n(c)\nVQCD (r; \u03bcB )\n\n=C\n\n(c) \u03b1s (\u03bcB )\n\nr\n\n\u0014\n\no\n\u03b1s (\u03bcB ) n\n(c)\n2\u03b20 [ln(\u03bcB r) + \u03b3E ] + a1\n1+\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0015\n\n(2.19)\n\nwith\nC (1) = \u2212CF ,\n\u03b20 =\n\nC (8) =\n\n11\n2\nCA \u2212 n q ,\n3\n3\n\nCA\n\u2212 CF ,\n2\n(1)\n\n(8)\n\na1 = a 1 =\n\n(2.20)\n31\n10\nCA \u2212 n q ,\n9\n9\n\n(2.21)\n\nfor the MS coupling.

The green solid line is calculated with E \u2032 = E + E 2 /(4mt ) [Eq. (2.9)], while the red\ndot-dashed line is calculated with E instead of E \u2032 .

The dotted lines are those for the gg \u2192 tt\u0304 process (production of on-shell top quarks).\n\n(\u03b1s (\u03bcB ) = 0.153).\nNow we perform a few tests of our formulas, Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10). First we examine the\nimpact of the replacement E \u2192 E \u2032 . The tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions d\u03c3\u0302/dmtt\u0304 computed\nwith these formulas are compared with d\u03c3\u0302/dmtt\u0304 computed by the formulas valid only in\nthe threshold region, namely Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10) after we replace E \u2032 by E. In Fig. 3\nwe plot \u03c3\u0302 for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 in the color-singlet channel.k The green solid and dotted lines\nare those computed using Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10), respectively, while the red dot-dashed\nand dotted lines are those computed with the same formulas but after the replacement\nE \u2032 \u2192 E. For comparison, the Born cross-sections [using Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10) but without\nthe enhancement factors] are also plotted with the dashed and dotted black lines. All\nthe cross sections are computed with mt = 173 GeV and \u0393t = 1.49 GeV (the tree-level\ntop-quark decay-width).\nThe difference between the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions using Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10)\n(solid and dotted green lines) is due to O(\u0393t /mt ) corrections. The replacement E \u2032 \u2192 E\nin Eq. (2.10) changes the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution slightly above the tt\u0304 threshold;\ncompare the green dotted and red dotted lines. The difference between the two cross\nsections is about 2.5% in the large mtt\u0304 region.\nOn the other hand, the effect of the replacement E \u2032 \u2192 E in Eq. (2.8) is much more\npronounced above the tt\u0304 threshold. There exist a large enhancement which amounts to\nk\n\nIn Secs. 2.1 and 2.2, the partonic tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution (before including the effects of ISR\nand parton distribution function) is proportional to the partonic total cross-section and delta function,\nd\u03c3\u0302/dmtt\u0304 \u221d \u03c3\u0302\u03b4(\u015d \u2212 m2tt\u0304 ); c.f. eq. (17) of [20]. Hence, we plot \u03c3\u0302(\u015d = m2tt\u0304 ) instead of d\u03c3\u0302/dmtt\u0304 in these\nsubsections.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f2\n2\n\nE'= E + E /4m\nE' -> E\nBorn-level\n\n1.8\n\nmtt = 360 GeV\n\n^\n\u03c3\n\nbWbW\n\n^\n/\u03c3\ntt\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n10\n\n-1\n\n\u0393t [GeV]\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFigure 4: Ratios of the partonic cross sections for gg \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 and gg \u2192 tt\u0304, in the colorsinglet channel at mtt\u0304 = 360 GeV. These are plotted as functions of \u0393t . Green solid, red dashed\nand black dotted lines are those with the modified energy E \u2032 , with E instead of E \u2032 , and for the\nBorn cross-sections, respectively.\n\nnearly a factor of two around mtt\u0304 = 400 GeV; compare the green solid and red dot-dashed\nlines. The origin of this large enhancement can be identified with a mismatch of the on-shell\n(c)\nconditions satisfied by the pole positions of the t and t\u0304 propagators contained in Mtt\u0304,tree and\n(c)\n\nby the pole position contained in G0 (E + i\u0393t , p~). [Note that \u03c3\u0302tot,tree in Eq. (2.10) does not\ncontain the t or t\u0304 propagator, so that this mismatch problem does not occur when we replace\nE \u2032 by E in Eq. (2.10); compare the green and red dotted lines.] In fact, the mechanism of\nthis abnormally large deviation is closely tied to a characteristic bound-state effect on the\ninvariant-mass distributions of the bW + and b\u0304W \u2212 systems. We will investigate this issue\nin detail in Sec. 3, in which we examine closely the differential distributions. Nevertheless,\neven without going into these details, the present comparison clearly shows the necessity of\na proper treatment of the relativistic kinematics, when we include the bound-state effects\nto the fully differential cross section of the process I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 .\n\nSince our formulas are correct in the narrow width limit \u0393t \u2192 0, the unitarity relation\nshould be restored in this limit. In order to check this, in Fig. 4 we plot the ratios of\nd\u03c3\u0302/dmtt\u0304 computed using Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10) as we vary the value of \u0393t at a fixed mtt\u0304 of\n360 GeV.\u2217\u2217 We confirm that the ratio approaches to unity as \u0393t is reduced, in the case that\nwe use our relativistic formulas (green solid line) or in the case that we use the tree-level\ncross sections (black dotted line). In sharp contrast, the ratio does not approach to unity\nin the case that we replace E \u2032 by E (red dashed line) due to the mismatch problem. It\nshows invalidity of the non-relativistic approximation far above the threshold, especially\nfor the fully differential cross section.\n\u2217\u2217\n\nAs we vary the value of \u0393t in the t propagator and the Green functions, the value of the weak gauge\ncoupling constant gW in the tbW vertex is varied consistently, such that the tree-level top-quark width\ntakes the correct value.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f20\n\ncolor-sum\n\nOverall\nJ=0\nBorn-level\n\n^ [pb]\n\u03c3\ntt\n\n15\ncolor-octet\n\n10\n\ncolor-singlet\n\n5\n\n0\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\nmtt [GeV]\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\nFigure 5: Partonic tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 in the color-singlet (red), color-octet\n(blue) channels, and the sum of them (black). The solid lines are calculated by multiplying the\nbound-state enhancement factor to the whole tt\u0304 amplitude. The dashed lines are calculated as the\nsum of contributions from all J's, where only the J = 0 amplitude is multiplied by the enhancement\nfactor. The dotted lines represent the Born cross-sections corresponding to the above lines.\n\nAs is well known, the leading-order bound-state effects in the tt\u0304 threshold region are\ncontained in the S-wave part of the amplitude. In the case of gg \u2192 tt\u0304, the S-wave contributions reside in the J = 0 amplitude both for the color-singlet and color-octet channels.\nHence, it may be more appropriate to include the bound-state effects only in the J = 0\namplitude, rather than multiplying the whole tt\u0304 amplitude by the enhancement factor as\nin Eq. (2.8). Theoretically, the difference between the two prescriptions is subleading. We\nexamine this feature by comparing the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions computed in both\nways. In Fig. 5, we plot the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 process. Each solid\nline represents the cross section computed using Eq. (2.10), namely, the whole Born crosssection (the sum of the Born cross-sections for all J's) is multiplied by the enhancement\nfactor. Each dashed line represents the sum of the cross sections for all J's, where only the\nJ = 0 cross section is multiplied by the enhancement factor. The red (solid and dashed)\nlines represent the cross sections for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 in the color-singlet channel, while the blue\n(solid and dashed) line represent those in the color-octet channel.\nThe cross section in the singlet channel is more enhanced if we use the overall prescription, Eq. (2.10), since the force between the color-singlet tt\u0304 pair is attractive and hence\nthe enhancement factor is larger than one. The difference of the two prescriptions is sizable only above the tt\u0304 threshold and becomes maximal around mtt\u0304 \u2243 400 GeV, where the\ndifference is about 7%. On the other hand, the cross section in the octet channel is more\nreduced if we use the overall prescription, since the force between the color-octet tt\u0304 pair\nis repulsive and the enhancement factor is (slightly) less than one. The difference of the\ntwo prescriptions is at most 2%. The black lines (solid and dashed) represent the sum\nof the cross sections for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 in the above two channels. The difference of the two\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fprescriptions in this case is at most about 1%, since the differences have opposite signs in\nthe two channels and are largely canceled. Thus, the difference of the two prescriptions\nis rather small and much smaller than other subleading corrections which we neglect in\nour analysis. Furthermore, we have checked that the above tendencies are not changed\nsignificantly by the ISR effects. Therefore, for simplicity of our analysis, we will adopt the\noverall prescription in the following analysis, namely, we will not decompose the amplitude\ninto different J's.\nIn the case of q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304, there is only the J = 1 color-octet channel at tree level. Hence,\nthe enhancement factor multiplies the whole amplitude also in this case.\n2.2 Effects of large \u0393t\nIn this subsection we describe how we incorporate part of the subleading corrections that\nare induced by the large top-quark width. As an inevitable consequence of numerically\nintegrating the fully differential cross sections for I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 , there is a significant\nphase-space-suppression effect. We partly compensate this effect, which is related to a\ngauge cancellation inherent in the inclusive cross section.\nFirst, we briefly review existing theoretical studies on the treatment of the top-quark\nwidth, in the cases with and without bound-state effects. In the latter case, many schemes\nhave been proposed for incorporating the top-quark width. The use of the top-quark propagator in Eq. (2.2) is called the fixed-width scheme (FWS). It is widely used in simple\nanalysis of the cross sections which include the top quark as an unstable intermediate particle. It is known, however, that subleading electroweak effects are not properly treated in\nthis scheme. At present, the complex-mass scheme (CMS) [39] seems to be most advanced\nfrom a practical point of view, due to the simplicity of its implementation. In fact, for\nthe process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 , which is kinematically similar to tt\u0304 productions, the fully\ndifferential cross section has been computed incorporating the effects of W -boson width\nwith NLO accuracy in this scheme, basically in all kinematical regions [40]. For tt\u0304 productions in hadron collisions, the fully differential cross sections is computed incorporating\ntop-quark width with LO accuracy in CMS, and various differential cross sections in different schemes were compared [30]. In particular, the study has shown an agreement within\nerrors between all the calculated cross sections in CMS and in FWS. (FWS is simpler but\nless sophisticated than CMS.)\nRegarding tt\u0304 productions in the threshold region including the bound-state effects,\nstudies on the finite-width effects are most advanced in the total cross section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192\ntt\u0304. The finite-width effects have been incorporated with NNLO accuracy\u2217 [41, 42], using\nthe velocity-Non-Relativistic QCD (vNRQCD) effective field theory framework [43, 44].\nRecently an NLO correction to the total cross section arising from the single-top resonance\nregion has been pointed out and computed in [31], using unstable-particle effective field\ntheory [45, 46]. On the other hand, in the corresponding fully differential cross section the\nwidth effects are incorporated only up to NLO accuracy [47] (apart from the contributions\nfrom the single-top resonance region). MC generators, developed specifically for simulation\n\u2217\n\nIn the tt\u0304 threshold region, it is customary to count \u0393t /mt \u223c O(\u03b1W ) \u223c O(\u03b12s ).\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fstudies in the threshold region of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 process, have incorporated both boundstate effects and finite-width effects in the LO approximation [22, 24]. For tt\u0304 productions in\nhadron collisions, only the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions have been computed with NLO\naccuracy, incorporating the bound-state effects, finite-width effects and ISR effects in the\nthreshold region [20, 21].\nOne effect is known to be particularly important in computing the fully differential\ncross sections in the threshold region of tt\u0304 productions. It is the phase-space-suppression\neffect [25, 26, 48], which is formally an NNLO effect of the top-quark width, but it seriously\nmodifies the shape of the sharply rising S-wave cross section as a function of mtt\u0304 , after\nintegrating the differential cross section over the final-state phase-space [25]. Let us briefly\nexplain this effect. The tt\u0304 cross section starts to rise below the tt\u0304 threshold mtt\u0304 = 2mt\nas a result of formation of tt\u0304 resonances. This means that the dominant kinematical configuration is such that one of t and t\u0304 is on-shell and the other is off-shell. Therefore, the\nphase-space of bW which decayed from the off-shell t or t\u0304 is reduced as compared to the\non-shell case. This suppresses the production cross section, and this effect is automatically\nincorporated if we integrate the LO differential cross section numerically over the phasespace of the final bW + b\u0304W \u2212 . A remarkable feature is that there is another effect at NNLO\nwhich exactly cancels the phase-space-suppression effect, for the integrated cross section\nat each tt\u0304 invariant-mass [49, 50]. This is the Coulomb-enhancement effect due to gluon\nexchanges between t and b\u0304 (decayed from t\u0304) and between t\u0304 and b. The cancellation is guaranteed by gauge invariance (Ward identity). It protects the tt\u0304 resonance widths from being\ndetermined by gauge-dependent off-shell width of the top quark. Consequently the only\nsurviving NNLO effect to the tt\u0304 resonance widths turns out to be the time-dilatation effect\ndue to the relative motion of t and t\u0304 inside the resonances, which is gauge independent.\u2020\nThus, we face a problem when we compute differential cross sections in the tt\u0304 threshold\nregion by a MC generator: The phase-space-suppression effect is automatically incorporated, while the Coulomb-enhancement effect due to gluon exchanges between t and b\u0304 (or t\u0304\nand b) is difficult to incorporate in a MC generator. (This is not yet achieved even in theoretical computations of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 differential cross sections.) Our prescription in this\nstudy is only effective. Since we know that the phase-space-suppression effect is canceled\n(c)\nin the inclusive tt\u0304 cross section, we multiply the tt\u0304 amplitude Mtt\u0304 (I \u2192 tt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 )\nby an enhancement factor such that the phase-space-suppression factor is canceled. In\naddition, we include the non-resonant diagrams, which are formally O(\u0393t /mt ) compared\nto the LO amplitude.\nHence, our full amplitude at the parton level is given by\n\n(c)\n(c)\nfnr\nf(c) + M\nMbW + b\u0304W \u2212 (I \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 ) = M\ntt\u0304\n\u2020\n\n(2.22)\n\nIn principle, the momenta of t and t\u0304 can be determined from the final state, in the LO approximation.\nHence, the relative motion is a gauge-independent quantity.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fwith\n\n(c)\n\n\u0014\n\u00151\n2\nmt \u0393t\nmt \u0393t\n(c)\n(c)\nf\n*\u221a\nMtt\u0304 = Mtt\u0304 \u00d7 \u221a\n,\nst \u0393t (st )\nst\u0304 \u0393t (st\u0304 )\n\u00151 !\n\u0014\n2\nm\n\u0393\nm\n\u0393\n(c)\nt\nt\nt\nt\n(c)\nf(c) = M\n+ Mnr\n,\n*\n\u00d7\n1\n\u2212\nM\n\u221a\n\u221a\nnr\ntt\u0304,tree\nst \u0393t (st )\nst\u0304 \u0393t (st\u0304 )\n\n(2.23)\n(2.24)\n\n(c)\n\nwhere Mtt\u0304 is defined by Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), and Mnr denotes the sum of the tree-level\nnon-resonant diagrams. The factor in the square bracket represents the inverse of the\nphase-space-suppression factor (see App. B for the derivation), where \u0393t (st ) denotes the\nrunning top-quark width in unitary gauge evaluated at the top-quark invariant-mass st ; its\nexplicit form is given in App. B, Eq. (B.5). At large tt\u0304 invariant-masses, the bound-state\n(c)\n(c)\neffects diminish, namely Mtt\u0304 \u2192 Mtt\u0304,tree , hence the above bW + b\u0304W \u2212 amplitude is defined\n(c)\n\n(c)\n\n(c)\n\nsuch that it reduces to the tree-level amplitude, MbW + b\u0304W \u2212 \u2192 Mtt\u0304,tree + Mnr .\nAt the differential level, the above treatment of the cancellation of the phase-spacesuppression effect is only effective, since the Coulomb-enhancement effect does not cancel\nthe phase-space-suppression effect at each kinematical point. Nevertheless, we consider\nthat a higher priority should be given to the gauge cancellation mechanism that is inherent\nin the inclusive cross section. We also note that the replacement E \u2192 E \u2032 in the Green\nfunction, Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), automatically incorporates the time-dilatation effects to the\nresonance widths.\u2021\nIn Fig. 6, we compare the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions for gg \u2192 tt\u0304 and q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304 in\nall the channels, which are computed by integrating the following four cross sections over\nthe bW + b\u0304W \u2212 phase-space, where the tt\u0304 invariant-mass mtt\u0304 is defined as the invariant-mass\n(c)\nf(c) |2 (blue dashed), (iii)\nof the final bW + b\u0304W \u2212 system: (i) |Mtt\u0304 |2 (black dotted), (ii) |M\ntt\u0304\n(c)\n\n(c)\n\n|Mtt\u0304 + Mnr |2 (red dot-dashed), and (iv) the absolute square of our formula Eq. (2.22)\n(green solid). Comparing the distributions for (i) and (ii), or, (iii) and (iv), we see that the\nphase-space-suppression effects are sizable especially close to the threshold of gg \u2192 tt\u0304 in the\ncolor-singlet channel. This is consistent with the explanation given above. In particular, in\neach figure the difference between (iii) and (iv) is hardly visible at large mtt\u0304 . We may also\ncompare the distributions for (i) and (iii), or, (ii) and (iv), to see the contributions of the\nnon-resonant amplitude. The contributions become comparatively larger at high energies\n(c)\nfor gluon-fusion channels, since the contribution of the s-channel diagram in Mtt\u0304 decreases,\n(c)\n\nwhile contributions of the single-resonant diagrams in Mnr increase. On the other hand,\nfor q q\u0304 channel, contributions from the non-resonant diagrams are small everywhere.\nIn Fig. 7(a) we plot the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions for gg \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 (sum of\nthe color-singlet and octet channels), using Eq. (2.22) after integrating over the bW + b\u0304W \u2212\nphase-space (red solid line).

In addition, we determine the K-factors to match our predictions for the\ntt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions to the available NLO predictions.\nIn hadron collisions, it is important to include the ISR effects. In our framework,\nthey are incorporated by connecting the differential cross sections computed from the\nmatrix elements Eq. (2.8) to a parton-shower simulator such as PYTHIA [51] or HERWIG [52].\nIn addition, we include \"K-factors\" as the normalization constants of the cross sections\nfor I \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 in the individual channels.\u00a7 The K-factors are determined such that\nthe tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution for each channel in the threshold region matches the\ncorresponding NLO prediction in the threshold region. We also extrapolate these Kfactors to the large mtt\u0304 region. The main reason to do so is a lack of the NLO predictions\nin the large mtt\u0304 region for the individual channels: The present theoretical prediction for\nthe NLO tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution in the large mtt\u0304 region is provided numerically only\nfor the color-summed cross section for on-shell top-quark productions [12]. Theoretically,\nby naive extrapolation of the K-factors, we reproduce the double-logarithmic terms of\nthe cross sections correctly in the large mtt\u0304 region, due to the universal structure of softgluon emissions; on the other hand, we do not reproduce the single-logarithmic and nonlogarithmic terms.\nThe NLO corrections to the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions in the threshold region\nare known for the individual channels [20, 21]. The corrections are given in terms of the\nhard-correction factors and the gluon radiation functions. The major difference of the\n\u221a\npredictions of [20] and [21] is that in the latter predictions contributions from high \u015d\n\u00a7\n\nNote that the parton shower simulators incorporate ISR effects by way of stochastic processes, and that\nthe tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions handed to the simulators at the parton level are not affected by the ISR\neffects.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\f(the c.m. collision energy of the initial partons) are included more accurately.\u00b6 Hence, we\nuse the latter predictions to compute the K-factorsk . We can determine the K-factors by\ntaking the ratios of these NLO partonic cross sections and our (LO) partonic cross sections\ngiven in Sec. 2.2. Since the NLO cross sections [20, 21] do not include contributions from\n(c)\nnon-resonant diagrams Mnr , accordingly we incorporate only the contributions from the\n(c)\nf in the LO cross sections when we compute the K-factors. (In most\nresonant diagrams M\ntt\u0304\n(c)\nfnr\nof the threshold region, the effect of M\nis irrelevant in any case, since resonant diagrams\n\ndominate.) Furthermore, in calculating the K-factors, we use the CTEQ6M PDFs [56] and\nthe 2-loop running of the strong coupling constant \u03b1s for the NLO mtt\u0304 distribution, while\nthe CTEQ6L1 PDFs and the 1-loop running of \u03b1s are used for the LO distribution. (We\nfind that the K-factors obtained by using the MSTW2008 PDFs [57] are quite similar.)\nIn general, the K-factors depend on mtt\u0304 . We first examine mtt\u0304 -dependences of the\nK-factors as we choose different renormalization and factorization scales, \u03bcR and \u03bcF . The\nrenormalization scale \u03bcR enters the NLO formula as the scale of the strong coupling constant and also through the logarithmic term in the hard-vertex function; see Eq. (3.2) of\n[21]. On the other hand, the factorization scale \u03bcF enters the NLO formula as the scale of\n\u0001\nthe parton distribution functions (PDFs) and through the terms with ln m2tt\u0304 /\u03bc2F in the\ngluon radiation functions; see Eqs. (3.4-3.7) of [21]. We find that, the mtt\u0304 -dependences of\nthe K-factors can be relatively flat in the threshold region, with appropriate choices of \u03bcR\nand \u03bcF . In this case, extrapolation of the K-factors from the threshold region to the high\nmtt\u0304 region can be performed trivially. Indeed, for simplicity of our analysis, we take the\nK-factors to be independent of mtt\u0304 . In Fig. 8, we plot the K-factors of the tt\u0304 invariant-mass\n\u221a\ndistributions in the individual channels at the LHC with s = 14 TeV, in the cases that we\nchoose the scales as \u03bcR = \u03bcF = \u03bamt with \u03ba = 0.5, 1, 2. As can be seen, the mtt\u0304 -dependence\nof the K-factors are mild. We have also examined the K-factors corresponding to the LHC\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith s = 7 TeV and Tevatron with s = 1.96 TeV; we find that the K-factors are only\nmildly dependent on mtt\u0304 also in these cases. In Table 1, we list the numerical values of\n\u221a\nthe K-factors for all the channels corresponding to the LHC s = 14 TeV, 7 TeV and\n\u221a\nTevatron s = 1.96 TeV, obtained at mtt\u0304 = 2mt for \u03bcR = \u03bcF = \u03bamt with \u03ba = 0.5, 1, 2.\nThe values of the K-factors for \u03ba = 1 will be used in the following.\nWe check consistency of our K-factor normalization in the large mtt\u0304 region, by comparing our prediction for the color-summed tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution with the NLO\nprediction. In Fig. 9 we plot the ratio of these two cross sections. In the former distribu(c)\nfnr\ntion, we include the K-factors, while we do not include the non-resonant diagrams M\n[c.f. (ii) of Fig. 6]. The latter distribution is computed for the on-shell tt\u0304 productions,\nq\nby MC@NLO [34, 35] with CTEQ6M PDFs with a scale choice \u03bcF = \u03bcR =\n\nm2t + p2T,t .\n\nAs can be seen, both cross sections are mutually consistent within 2% accuracy up to\nmtt\u0304 = 800 GeV.\nIncluding non-resonant diagrams in a way that the gauge cancellation holds effectively,\n\u00b6\n\nIn the gluon radiation functions, the terms enhanced by plus-distributions or delta-functions as z \u2192 1\nare common in [20] and [21], while non-enhanced terms differ.\nk\nIn [21], effects of resummation of threshold logs are also examined and found to enhance the normalization at 10% level.

Event Generation and Top-Quark Distributions\n\nIn this section, we present numerical evaluations of various kinematical distributions of\nthe top-quark computed from the pp \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 cross section, using the theoretical\nframework explained in the previous section. In particular we study the bound-state effects\non these distributions.\nOur numerical calculations are carried out based on the MadGraph output [58] which\nmakes use of the HELAS subroutines [59] for helicity-amplitude calculations. The original\nMadGraph output code has been modified to implement the color-decomposition and to\ninclude the bound-state effects via the Green functions. For the convenience of the readers,\nwe collect the formulas necessary for decomposing amplitudes into the color-singlet and\noctet components of the tt\u0304 (or bb\u0304) system in Appendix C. In particular, we discuss how to\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fimplement the color decomposition into the MadGraph notation. The bound-state correction\nfactor\nG (c) (E, p~) =\n\nG(c) (E, p~)\n,\nG0 (E, p~)\n\n(3.1)\n\nc.f. Eq. (2.8), is pre-tabulated to save time for computing the momentum-space Green\nfunctions\u2217 .\nWe perform phase-space integrations using BASES/SPRING [60], or alternatively by\nadapting our code to MadEvent [32, 33] utilities (ver. 4.4.42), where both tools are able\nto generate unweighted events at the partonic final-state level. For each event, we assign\nthe specific color-flow according to an ordinary manner, except the color-singlet channel,\nas explained in Appendix C. The generated events can be subsequently provided e.g. to\nPYTHIA for simulations of parton-showering and hadronizations.\nIn the main body of this paper, we do not consider the decay of W 's but consider only\nthe observables constructed from the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 final state. The W -boson decays can be\nincorporated at the PYTHIA stage, where however the polarization of W -bosons cannot be\ntaken into account. Alternatively, one can calculate the helicity amplitudes including the\ndecay of W -bosons by specifying a decay mode for each W -boson. In Appendix D, as a\nsample case, we examine the distributions of dileptons in the dilepton mode, where both\nW 's decay leptonically, and study the effects of W -boson polarization and bound-state\ncorrections.\nBelow we show the results at the partonic bW + b\u0304W \u2212 final-state level. We do not discuss\nthe parton-showering and hadronization effects, in order to concentrate on the examination of bound-state effects. For the parton distribution functions, we use the CTEQ6L1\nparameterization with the LO evolution (1-loop running) of the QCD coupling constant.\nWe set the renormalization and factorization scales to \u03bcR = \u03bcF = mt and incorporate the\nK-factors obtained in Sec. 2.3 to the cross sections in the individual channels. [The final\nformula for the matrix element is given by Eq. (2.25).] We set the top-quark pole-mass, the\n(tree-level) on-shell top-quark width and the strong coupling constant as mt = 173 GeV,\n\u0393t = 1.49 GeV and \u03b1s (Mz ) = 0.1298, respectively.\nIn Fig. 10(a), we plot the tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution in pp \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 production\n\u221a\nat s = 14 TeV. The tt\u0304 invariant-mass mtt\u0304 is defined as the invariant-mass of the final\nbW + b\u0304W \u2212 system. The green solid line represents the full result which includes the boundstate effects as well as the K-factors, and the blue dashed line represents the Born-level\nresult (the LO prediction in the conventional perturbative QCD approach). Fig. 10(b)\nshows a magnification of the same cross sections in the threshold region. As shown in\n[20, 21], theoretically the bound-state effects can be seen most clearly in the shape of the\nmtt\u0304 distribution in the threshold region. One can see that the cross section is enhanced over\nthe Born cross-section significantly by the bound-state effects, and there appears a broad\npeak below the threshold corresponding to the 1 S0 resonance state in the color-singlet tt\u0304\nchannel. Far above the threshold, the bound-state effects disappear and the cross section\napproaches the Born-level distributions, up to the K-factor normalization.\n\u2217\n\nThe S-wave Green function depends only on |~\np| but not on the direction of the three-momenta.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\f4\n\n4\nLHC /s = 14 TeV\nFull result\nBorn-level\nMC@NLO\n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500 550 600\nmtt [GeV]\n\n650\n\n700\n\n750\n\nFull result\nBorn-level\nMC@NLO\n\n2.5\n\n1\n\n0\n300\n\nLHC /s = 14 TeV\n\n3\n\nd\u03c3/dmtt [pb/GeV]\n\nd\u03c3/dmtt [pb/GeV]\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\n330\n\n800\n\n335\n\n340\n\n345\n\n350 355 360\nmtt [GeV]\n\n(a)\n\n365\n\n370\n\n375\n\n380\n\n(b)\n\n\u221a\nFigure 10: tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution in pp \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 at s = 14 TeV.

The latter prediction includes the full NLO QCD corrections (but not the\n\nCoulomb resummation) for the on-shell tt\u0304 productions; we switched on an option of MC@NLO\nto incorporate off-shellness of the top-quarks effectively by re-weighting the cross section\nby skewed Breit-Wigner functions [61], so that the cross section is non-zero below the\nthreshold. (However, non-resonant diagrams are not incorporated.) Below and near the\nthreshold, our prediction is much larger than the MC@NLO prediction, due to the bound-state\nformation. The two cross sections become approximately equal from around mtt\u0304 \u223c 370\u2013\n380 GeV up to larger mtt\u0304 . Note that, in Fig. 9, the contributions from non-resonant\ndiagrams are not included in our full prediction, whereas in Figs. 10 they are included.\nIntegrating the distributions over mtt\u0304 , the total cross section by our full (Born-level) calculation is estimated as \u03c3bW + b\u0304W \u2212 = 855 pb (633 pb), while we obtain \u03c3tt\u0304 = 816 pb as the\nMC@NLO prediction.\nThe shape of the mtt\u0304 distribution at the LHC 7 TeV, shown in Fig. 11, is similar to\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\f800\n\n177\n\nmbW - [GeV]\n\n178\n\nmbW - [GeV]\n\n178\n\n800\n\n177\n\n700\n\n176\n\n700\n\n176\n\n175\n\n600\n\n175\n\n600\n\n174\n\n500\n\n174\n\n500\n\n400\n\n173\n\n400\n\n173\n172\n\n300\n\n171\n170\n169\n\n172\n\n300\n\n171\n200\n\nBorn-level\nMean x 172.9\nMean y 172.9\nRMS x 1.437\nRMS y 1.436\n\n100\n\n168\n0\n168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178\nmbW+ [GeV]\n\n170\n169\n\n200\n\nFull result\nMean x 172.7\nMean y 172.7\nRMS x 1.511\nRMS y 1.514\n\n100\n\n168\n0\n168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178\nmbW+ [GeV]\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 12: Two-dimensional density plots of the bW + and b\u0304W \u2212 invariant-masses, for the events\n\u221a\nwith mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV at the LHC s = 14 TeV. Left figure (a) is the Born-level prediction and\nright figure (b) is our full result (including the bound-state corrections and K-factors). The mean\nvalue and the root-mean-square value displayed in each figure are calculated for the events within\nthe frame of the figure.\n\nthat for the LHC 14 TeV. The total cross sections are estimated to be 158 pb, 106 pb and\n146 pb by our full, Born-level calculations and MC@NLO, respectively.\nLet us examine other distributions of the top quark. From Figs. 10 and 11, it is obvious\nthat the phase-space region, where the bound-state effects are important, corresponds to a\nrather limited portion of the full top-quark events produced at the LHC. Thus, in various\ndistributions formed by the full events, the bound-state effects may well be negligible in\npractice. In order to examine the bound-state effects closely, in the following we consider\nthe events restricted by mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV (except where otherwise stated), instead of considering the full events. They amount to about 9% (8%) of the full events according to\nour calculation with (without) the bound-state corrections at the LHC 14 TeV. Due to the\nlarge tt\u0304 cross sections at the LHC, still a large number of such near-threshold events would\nbe accumulated. In this paper, we do not discuss the important subject of how to measure\nmtt\u0304 in real experiments, which requires detailed studies of errors and fake solutions; one\nmay find them in earlier studies [15, 17].\nOne observes a characteristic bound-state effect in the (bW + )-(b\u0304W \u2212 ) double-invariantmass distribution. In Figs. 12, we show the density plots of the invariant-masses of the bW +\nand b\u0304W \u2212 systems, given by (a) the Born-level prediction and (b) our full prediction. In\neach figure, the number of events is normalized to 100,000 in total, and the number of events\nper bin (0.2 GeV\u00d70.2 GeV) is plotted with graded colors. The Born-level prediction (a) is\nessentially determined by the product of the Breit-Wigner functions, hence the distribution\nis almost reflection symmetric with respect to the on-shell lines (pb + pW + )2 = m2t and\n(pb\u0304 + pW \u2212 )2 = m2t . By contrast, the distribution by our full prediction (b) is not symmetric\nand biased towards the configuration, where one of t or t\u0304 is on-shell and the other has an\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fk\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nmtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV\nboth [%]\neither [%]\n37.0 (41.1) 87.0 (87.6)\n55.5 (59.0) 95.2 (95.2)\n64.2 (66.3) 97.3 (97.1)\n69.2 (70.3) 98.1 (98.0)\n72.3 (72.9) 98.6 (98.4)\n\nFull events\nboth [%]\neither [%]\n46.8 (47.7) 90.3 (90.4)\n67.6 (68.3) 97.0 (97.0)\n76.3 (76.8) 98.5 (98.5)\n81.0 (81.4) 99.1 (99.1)\n83.9 (84.2) 99.4 (99.4)\n\nTable 2: A fraction of events which satisfy |mbW \u2212 mt | \u2264 k\u0393t for both or either of the bW\ninvariant-masses. The events with mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV as well as the full events at the LHC 14 TeV are\nconsidered. In the bracket is shown the result in Born-level.\n\ninvariant-mass smaller than mt . In fact, such a configuration is known to be the dominant\nconfiguration just below the threshold in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 tt\u0304 [25, 24], although in that case deviation\nfrom the double Breit-Wigner distribution [Fig. 12(a)] is more prominent. (Note that, below\nthe threshold, t and t\u0304 cannot become simultaneously on-shell.)\nIn order to quantify the correlated deformation of the double-invariant-mass distribution, we count the fraction of the events for which both or either of the bW + and b\u0304W \u2212\ninvariant-masses satisfy\n|mbW \u2212 mt | \u2264 k\u0393t ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere k = 1, 2, . . . , 5. These fractions are tabulated in Table 2 for our full prediction\nand for the Born-level prediction. The bound-state effect reduces the fraction for which\nboth invariant-masses are close to on-shell more than the fraction for which either of the\ninvariant-masses is close to on-shell. In the former case, the change of the fraction by\nthe bound-state effect amounts up to about 4%. For comparison, we also tabulate the\nsame fractions for the full events; in this case, the variation of the fractions are small\nand at most 1%. In any case, a proper understanding of this effect would be important,\nsince it potentially biases the mass cut and may affect, for instance, the top-quark mass\nmeasurement with high accuracy.\nLet us explain the mechanism how the bound-state effects alter the double-invariant(c)\nmass distribution.

The\nsolid lines represent our full prediction, after omitting the non-resonant diagrams. The dotted lines\nrepresent corresponding distributions at the Born-level. In Fig. (a), the distribution by the nonrelativistic formula (replacing E \u2032 \u2192 E in the Green function) is also plotted (the red dashed line).\n\nthe case that tt\u0304 is in the singlet channel (c = 1), the potential energy between t and t\u0304 is\n(1)\nnegative, VQCD (r) < 0. Therefore, the denominator of the Green function become close\nto zero (hence, the Green function\nis most enhanced) if p\u0302 is somewhat larger than the\nq\n\non-shell momentum pOS \u2261 m2tt\u0304 /4 \u2212 m2t , i.e., p\u0302 > pOS . On the other hand, the second\np\np\nfactor (p0t \u2212 p\u03022 + m2t )\u22121 + (p0t\u0304 \u2212 p\u03022 + m2t )\u22121 is most enhanced when p\u0302 = pOS , since\np0t + p0t\u0304 = mtt\u0304 . Thus, there is a competition between the two factors on the right-hand\nside of Eq. (3.3). As a consequence, the dominant configuration is the one in which neither\nof the two factors are maximal. In fact, in the dominant configuration one of t and t\u0304 is\non-shell and the other is off-shell: p\u03022t = m2t , p\u03022t\u0304 < m2t , or, p\u03022t < m2t , p\u03022t\u0304 = m2t . The effect is\nopposite in the case that tt\u0304 is in the octet channel (c = 8). Since the magnitude of the octet\n(1)\n(8)\npotential is much smaller than the singlet potential, VQCD /VQCD = \u22121/8, the bound-state\neffect turns out to be much larger in the singlet channel than in the octet channel.\nDisplayed in Figs. 13(a) and (b) are the top-quark momentum (p\u0302) distributions of\nthe events with mtt\u0304 = 370 GeV (not with mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV), for the color-singlet and octet\nchannels, respectively. To see essential features, only the tt\u0304 diagrams are taken into account\nand the K-factors are not included. In each figure, the black solid (blue dotted) line shows\nour full prediction (Born-level prediction). The peak momentum for each distribution is\nshown with a vertical line. The peak momenta of the Born-level distributions are (to a\ngood approximation) the on-shell momentum, p\u0302peak \u2248 pOS = 65.5 GeV. We see that the\nbound-state effects shift the peak momentum by about 0.7 GeV to a larger value for the\ncolor-singlet distribution, while the peak momentum of the color-octet channel is shifted\nonly by 50 MeV to a smaller value. In the color-summed cross section, the peak momentum\nis shifted to a larger value. Consequently, one of the invariant-masses of the bW + and b\u0304W \u2212\nsystems is reduced below mt . The integral of this effect over the region mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV\ncan be seen in Fig. 12(b).\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fOne may suspect that the above shifts of the invariant-masses (or the shift of the\npeak momentum) may be an artifact of our specific method to interpolate the tt\u0304 cross\nsections in the threshold region and in the higher mtt\u0304 region. To check this, let us estimate\nthe size of the shift of the peak momentum at mtt\u0304 = 370 GeV and compare it with the\nabove prediction. The distance a top-quark propagates before it decays is estimated as\n\u03b3c\u03c4 = mtt\u0304 /(2mt \u0393t ) = 0.72 GeV\u22121 = 1/(1.4 GeV). This distance is considered to be within\n(1)\nthe range where the potential VQCD (r) can be estimated perturbatively, although the 1loop potential tends to underestimate the bound-state effect.\u2020 The shift of the average\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\n(1)\nmomentum may be estimated by {mtt\u0304 \u2212 VQCD (\u03b3c\u03c4 )}2 /4 \u2212 m2t\n\u2212 pOS = 0.66 GeV.\nHence, the effect seen in Fig. 13(a) seems to be physical.\nWe note that the effect elucidated here is a kind of effect that can never be seen in\nperturbative QCD computations for the on-shell tt\u0304 productions, such as those given in\n[34, 35, 36]. This is because, the effect originates from the exchange of Coulomb gluons\nbetween off-shell t and on-shell t\u0304 (or vice versa). Our full prediction correctly incorporates\nthe (gauge-independent) LO off-shellness of the top quark as dictated by the exchange of\nCoulomb gluons, which is crucial for predicting the deformations of the top-quark momentum distribution and the double-invariant-mass distribution of the bW + and b\u0304W \u2212 systems.\nNow we are in a position to understand the origin of the abnormally large enhancement\nof the cross section, which we observed in Sec. 2.1, in the case that we use the nonrelativistic formula for the differential cross section at large mtt\u0304 ; see the red dot-dashed\nline\nnon-relativistic formula corresponds to replacing the Hamiltonian H =\np in Fig. 3. The\n(c)\n(c)\n2\n2\n2 p\u0302 + mt + VQCD (r) by H = 2mt + p\u03022 /mt + VQCD (r) in the Green function in Eq. (3.3).\nThus, the non-relativistic formulap\noverestimates the kinetic energy of the tt\u0304 system in the\n2\nlarge mtt\u0304 region, 2mt + p\u0302 /mt > 2 p\u03022 + m2t . For this reason, the two factors on the righthand side of Eq. (3.3) can be brought close to maximal simultaneously with a nearly on-shell\nmomentum, p\u0302 \u2243 pOS , since all the denominators in this expression nearly vanish. Since\nthe individual factors are made of pole-type functions, applying an inaccurate kinematical\nrelation only in one of the denominators can lead to a substantial overestimate of the cross\nsection. In Fig. 13(a) we also plot the top-quark-momentum distribution computed with\nthe non-relativistic formula, Eq. (2.8) after the replacement E \u2032 \u2192 E for the singlet channel\n(red dashed line). As can be seen, the peak momentum approaches the on-shell momentum\nand the distribution is more enhanced around the peak, compared to our full prediction.\nOther top-quark distributions are less affected by the bound-state effects. In Fig. 14(a),\nwe show the normalized distribution of the top-quark momentum p = |~\npt | = |~\npb + p~W + | in\nthe laboratory frame. In Fig. 14(b), we show the normalized distribution of the invariantmass of bW (bW + or b\u0304W \u2212 ). The Born-level and full predictions are shown by the green solid\nand blue dashed lines, respectively. These lines in Fig. 14(b) correspond to the projections\nof Figs. 12(a,b) to the mbW + (or mb\u0304W \u2212 ) axis. All the histograms in Figs. 14(a,b) are\nnormalized, such that their integrals take the same value.\nIn e+ e\u2212 collisions, the top-quark momentum distribution in the threshold region is\n\u2020\n\nSee e.g. [62] for the recent status of the perturbative prediction for the QCD potential.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fNormalized distribution\n\nNormalized distribution\n\nFull result\nBorn-level\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\nFull result\n\n0.09\n\nBorn-level\n\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450 500\np [GeV]\n\n(a)\n\n0\n168\n\n169\n\n170\n\n171\n\n172\n\n173\n\n174\n\n175\n\n176\n\n177 178\nmbW [GeV]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 14: Normalized distributions of (a) the top-quark momentum, p = |~\npt | = |~\npb + p~W + |, and\n(b) the bW invariant-mass, both defined in the lab. frame and for the events with mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV.\nGreen solid lines represent our full predictions, while the blue dashed lines represent the Born-level\npredictions.\n\nknown to be proportional to the absolute square of the momentum-space Green function [25, 26], whose shape is strongly influenced by the bound-state effects. At hadron\ncolliders, the top-quark momentum is boosted along the beam direction, and also the partonic collision energy is not fixed. As a result, even if we limit the events to those with\nmtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV, the distribution of the top-quark momentum (p, defined in the lab. frame)\nis not much affected by the bound-state effects at hadron colliders.\nThe mbW distribution is important for the determination of the top-quark mass, hence\nit should be understood well. The bound-state effects deform the Born-level mbW distribution towards the lower side. The mean values of mbW over the range |mbW \u2212 mt | < 5 GeV\nare estimated to be 172.7 GeV and 172.9 GeV, for the full and Born-level predictions,\nrespectively. The change of the mean value is about \u2212200 MeV, for the restricted events\nwith mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV. At the LHC 7 TeV, we obtain almost the same result as in the\n14 TeV case. At the Tevatron 1.96 TeV, where the q q\u0304 color-octet channel dominates, the\nmean values of mbW are estimated as 172.96 GeV and 172.98 GeV, respectively. Thus, the\nvariation of the mean value is rather small. Note that MC@NLO predicts a mbW distribution\nsimilar to the Born-level distribution, since it simply re-weights the on-shell tt\u0304 cross-section\nby skewed Breit-Wigner functions.\n\n4. Summary\nIn the first part of this paper (Sec. 2), we explain our theoretical framework for including\nthe bound-state effects in the fully differential cross sections for the top-quark production\nand their subsequent decay processes at hadron colliders.\nWe formulate a theoretical basis to compute the fully differential top-quark crosssections, which are valid at leading-order both in the threshold and high-energy regions,\nand which smoothly interpolate between the two regions. The tree-level tt\u0304 double-resonant\namplitude for each process is multiplied by a correction factor, which is written in terms\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fof the (well-known) non-relativistic Green function, but using a modified energy. This\nprescription preserves the required unitarity relation between the total and differential\ncross sections, which would be seriously violated had we used the naive non-relativistic\nformula for the differential cross sections at higher energies.\nWe also include into the cross sections two important subleading corrections induced\nby the large top-quark width. (i) In addition to the tt\u0304 double-resonant diagrams, which\nreceives the above bound-state corrections, we include the contributions of non-resonant\ndiagrams, whose effects are comparatively larger at higher energies. (This is more or less\ntrivial.) (ii) As long as we perform numerical integrations of the differential cross sections,\na sizable phase-space-suppression effect in the threshold region is inevitable, due to the\nsizable off-shellness of top quarks. In order to effectively account for the gauge cancellation\nby the Coulomb enhancement, we compensate the phase-space-suppression effect (by hand).\nFinally we incorporate ISR and the K-factors. ISR effects are incorporated by connecting our differential cross sections to a parton-shower simulator such as PYTHIA or\nHERWIG. We determine the K-factors for the cross sections in the individual channels by\nmatching them to the corresponding NLO tt\u0304 invariant-mass distributions in the threshold\nregion. With an appropriate choice of scales and using mtt\u0304 -independent K-factors, we have\nchecked that the color-summed tt\u0304 invariant-mass distribution agrees with the conventional\nNLO prediction by MC@NLO reasonably well at high energies.\nIn the latter part of the paper (Sec. 3), using the above fully differential cross sections,\nwe compute numerically various kinematical distributions of the top quark, constructed\nfrom the momenta of the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 final state (at the parton level). Our computations\nare carried out by MC event-generation using MadGraph, after implementing the color\ndecomposition and the bound-state corrections to the output codes.\nWe confirmed that our prediction reproduces the known NLO predictions for the tt\u0304\ninvariant-mass distribution in the threshold region (which include bound-state effects) at\nthe LHC 7 TeV or 14 TeV; in particular it exhibits the 1S resonance peak below threshold. Furthermore, our prediction approaches smoothly to the conventional NLO prediction\n(without bound-state effects) at higher invariant-masses, from around 30 GeV above the\nthreshold.\nWe restrict the events to those with mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV (in the case 2mt = 346 GeV),\ncorresponding to about 10% of the full events, and examine kinematical distributions other\nthan the mtt\u0304 distribution. In particular, a characteristic bound-state effect on the (bW + )(b\u0304W \u2212 ) double-invariant-mass distribution is observed. The distribution is deformed from\nthe double Breit-Wigner shape, towards the configuration in which one of the tt\u0304 pair is\nclose to on-shell and the other has a smaller invariant-mass than mt .\nThe effect can be understood as a consequence of a competition between the contributions from the (dominant) color-singlet Green function and from the t and t\u0304 propagators.\nIf the top-quark width were tiny, the Breit-Wigner distribution would tend to a deltafunction, and the top quarks would be forced to on-shell. Due to the large decay width,\nhowever, the binding effect (towards off-shell mass) and the Breit-Wigner constraint (towards on-shell mass) remain to be competitive up to a few tens GeV above the threshold.\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fThis effect lowers the mean value of each bW invariant-mass by a few hundred MeV for\nthe above restricted set of events. The correlated deformation of the double-invariant-mass\ndistribution may affect the mass cut and eventually the top quark mass measurement at\nthe LHC. This requires further careful investigations. It would be worth emphasizing that\nthe bound-state effect elucidated here can never be seen in the conventional perturbative\nQCD corrections to the on-shell tt\u0304 productions, since the off-shellness of the top quark\nby the LO Coulomb binding effects plays a crucial role, and therefore it signifies a unique\naspect of the present study.\nWe examine other distributions, namely the (single) bW invariant-mass distribution\nand top-quark-momentum distribution. The bound-state effects on these distributions as\na whole are not very significant, although there are certain systematic tendencies in the\nsmall deformations of the distributions, such as the aforementioned shift of the mean value\nof the invariant-mass. Furthermore, the dilepton distributions are examined including the\nleptonic decays of W 's at the matrix-element level (Appendix D). We have confirmed the\nprevious observations that the effects of W -boson polarization are quite significant, whereas\nwe find that the bound-state effects are much smaller.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank K.

Green function of the tt\u0304 system\nIn this Appendix we explain how part of the Feynman amplitude corresponding to I \u2192\ntt\u0304 \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 (I = gg and q q\u0304) can be identified with a Green function that dictates\nthe time evolution of the tt\u0304 system. The argument is not restricted to the non-relativistic\nregion. In order to define the bound-state as an eigenstate of the full Hamiltonian, we\nconsider the limit \u0393t \u2192 0.\u2217\nBefore providing a general argument, it would be pedagogical to demonstrate a decomposition of the three-point function h0 | T : \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(x) : \u03c8\u0304(y) \u03c8(z) | 0 i in the free top-quark\ncase, i.e., in the limit \u03b1s \u2192 0.

This corresponds to taking the contribution of the time ordering x0 < y 0 , z 0\nof the left-hand-side of the equation.

On the right-hand side, the factor\noutside the square bracket represents the time evolution of the tt\u0304 system. We may identify\nthe denominator of this factor with mtt\u0304 \u2212pH0 + i\u01eb and observe that the Hamiltonian H0 of\nthe free tt\u0304 system is given by 2\u03c9(~\np) = 2 p~ 2 + m2t . The first term in the square bracket\nrepresents the propagation of t after t\u0304 decayed first, whereas the second term represents\nthe propagation of t\u0304 after t decayed first.\nNow we develop a general argument.

Here and\nhereafter, Ad = \u03b3 0 A\u2020 \u03b3 0 denotes the Dirac conjugate. Decomposing the four-body phasespace and utilizing Eqs.

Taking this into account,\nthe off-shell cross section can be approximated by\n\u03bb(1, sst , sst\u0304 ) \u0010 m2t m2t \u0011\n(c)\n(c)\n\u03c3\u0302I,off (s; st , st\u0304 ) \u2243 \u03c3\u0302I\u2192tt\u0304 (s)\n,\n(B.11)\nFI\n,\n\u03b2t\nst st\u0304\n(c)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302I\u2192tt\u0304 (s) are the cross sections for the on-shell tt\u0304 productions; Fgg (x, y) = xy and\nFqq\u0304 (x, y) = (2 + x + y)/4. The factor \u03bb(1, sst , sst\u0304 ) originates from the tt\u0304 phase-space volume\nq\n4m2\nand reduces to \u03b2t = 1 \u2212 s t in the on-shell limit st = st\u0304 = m2t .\nThus, the ratio of the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 cross section to the on-shell tt\u0304 cross section is given\nby\n(c)\n\n\u03c3I\u2192bW +b\u0304W \u2212 (s)\n(c)\n\n\u03c3I\u2192tt\u0304 (s)\n\n\u2243\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb(1, sst ,\ndst dst\u0304\n\u03c1(st )\u03c1(st\u0304 )\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\n\u03b2t\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nst\u0304\ns)\n\nFI\n\n\u0010 m2 m2 \u0011\nt\n, t .\nst st\u0304\n\n(B.12)\n\n\f\u221a\n\n\u221a\nst \u0393t (st ) st\u0304 \u0393t (st\u0304 ) in the \u03c1 factors, which stems from the bW phase-space volumes, pos\u221a\ns\u0393t (s) \u223c s2 since the\nsesses strong dependences on the invariant-masses of t and t\u0304:\nrunning width behaves as \u0393t (s) \u223c s3/2 . Below the threshold, either of t and t\u0304 is forced to\n\u221a\n\u221a\nbe off-shell (p2 < m2t ), hence st \u0393t (st ) st\u0304 \u0393t (st\u0304 ) acts as a suppression factor. On the other\nhand, the remaining factors \u03bb/\u03b2t and FI give only weak enhancement near the threshold.\nThus, the effect of phase-space-suppression is approximately accounted for by the ratio\n\u221a\n\nst \u0393t (st )\n*\nmt \u0393t\n\n\u221a\n\nst\u0304 \u0393t (st\u0304 )\nmt \u0393t\n\n(B.13)\n\nfor fixed st and st\u0304 . The ratio Eq. (B.12) is considerably less than unity below the threshold.\n\nC. Color decomposition of the amplitude and color flow in gg channel\nIn this section, we describe the color structure of the gg \u2192 tt\u0304 matrix-element, and its\ndecomposition into color-singlet and octet components. Moreover, we comment on the\ncolor flow in gg channel.\nBy explicitly stating the color indices of initial-state gluons (a, b) and final-state t and\nt\u0304 (i,j), the matrix element at the Born-level can be written in a following form;\nMijab (pk , \u03bbk ) =\n\n1 h a bi\n1 n a bo\nT ,T\nT ,T\nMS (pk , \u03bbk ) +\nMA (pk , \u03bbk ),\n2\n2\nij\nij\n\n(C.1)\n\nwhere MS and MA represent the subamplitudes for color-symmetric and anti-symmetric\npart, respectively, which depend on the 4-momenta and helicities of initial- and final-state\nparticles. The color-factor in the color-symmetric part is decomposed into\n1 n a bo\n1 ab\n1\nT ,T\n=\n\u03b4 \u03b4ij + dabc Tijc ,\n2\n2N\n2\nij\n\n(C.2)\n\nwhere the first term represents color-singlet contribution and the second term color-octet.\nThe color-anti-symmetric part contains only color-octet contribution;\ni\n1 h a bi\nT ,T\n= f abc Tijc .\n2\n2\nij\n\n(C.3)\n\nSince each part do not interfere with each other, the absolute square of the amplitude with\nsumming over colors is given as a sum of each contribution;\nX\n\nMijab\n\n2\n\n=\n\ncolors\n\n+\n\nP\n\n1 ab\n\u03b4 \u03b4ij\n2N\n\nP 1 abc c\nd Tij\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n|MS |2\n\n|MS |2 +\n\nP i abc c\nf Tij\n2\n\n2\n\n|MA |2 .\n\n(C.4)\n\nThe first line in the r.h.s. in Eq. (C.4) is the color-singlet contribution and the second line\nthe color-octet.\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\fg\n\nt\n\ng\n\nt\n\ng\n\nt\n\ng\n\nt\u0304\n\ng\n\nt\u0304\n\ng\n\nt\u0304\n\nFigure 15: Color-flow diagrams in the gg \u2192 tt\u0304 amplitudes. Left diagram representing the colorfactor \u03b4 ab \u03b4ij is for the color-singlet case, middle and right diagrams representing the color-factor\n(T a T b )ij and (T b T a )ij , respectively, are for the color-octet case.\n\nAlternatively, we may express the amplitude in the following basis;\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nMijab (pk , \u03bbk ) = T a T b MJ1 (pk , \u03bbk ) + T b T a MJ2 (pk , \u03bbk ).\nij\n\nij\n\n(C.5)\n\nThe two basis, Eq. (C.1) and Eq. (C.5) are related by MS = MJ1 + MJ2 and MA =\nMJ1 \u2212 MJ2 . The absolute square of the amplitude is then written in a matrix form as,\u2021\n!\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011 16 \u22122\nX\n2\n1\nM\nJ\n1\n.\n(C.6)\nMijab =\nMJ\u22171 MJ\u22172\n3\nMJ2\n\u22122 16\ncolors\n\nBy rewriting the absolute square of the color-singlet part of the amplitude in this basis,\nthe corresponding matrix for the color-singlet gg \u2192 tt\u0304 amplitude is found to be\n!\n!\n2\n\u0011 22\nP 1 ab\n1\u0010 \u2217\nM\nJ\n2\n1\n.\n(C.7)\n\u03b4 \u03b4ij |MS | =\nMJ1 MJ\u22172\n2N\n3\nMJ2\n22\nThe color-octet contribution is obtained by subtracting Eq. (C.7) from Eq. (C.6).\nFinally, we comment on the color flow in gg channel.\u00a7 In the color-singlet case, the\ncolor flow is disconnected between initial-state and final-state, reflecting the color-factor\n\u03b4ab \u03b4ij ; see the left diagram in Fig. 15.\nIn the color-octet case, there exist two kind of color flows, middle and right diagrams\nin Fig. 15, associated with the color-factor; (T a T b )ij and (T b T a )ij , respectively. Either of\nthe two may be selected according to the ratio |MJ1 |2 : |MJ2 |2 at each phase-space point\nand given helicities of initial and final-state particles in event generations. The color flow\nin q q\u0304 channel is unique at Born-level.\n\nD. Dilepton distributions in dilepton decay mode\nIn the main body of this paper we assume that the W -bosons from top-quark decays are onshell. In this appendix, we take into account decays of the W -bosons at the matrix-element\nlevel. The advantage is to correctly take into account the off-shellness and polarization of\nthe W -bosons. This is crucial to predict correctly the angular distributions as well as other\n\u2021\n\nThis matrix corresponds to the matrix CF in the MadGraph code (matrix.f).\nWe thank F.

Top three graphs are for the full events, and bottom three graphs are for the events\nwith mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV. Blue solid line is the full result, blue dashed line is the Born-level result, and\nred dot-dashed line is obtained by the full calculation but assuming unpolarized W -bosons.\n\nkinematical distributions of the decay daughters of W 's. As an example, we show some\ndistributions in the dilepton decay mode pp \u2192 bW + b\u0304W \u2212 \u2192 bl+ \u03bdl b\u0304l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l , where l = e, \u03bc.\n\nWe calculate the amplitudes from the set of Feynman diagrams obtained by just adding\nthe W \u2192 l\u03bdl vertex to the Feynman diagrams for the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 final state. We generate\n\u221a\nthe dilepton events at the LHC s = 14 TeV with standard kinematical cuts for the\nlepton momenta, |\u03b7l | \u2264 2.5 and pT,l \u2265 10 GeV. To avoid a singularity due to the vanishing\nrunning top-quark width, see Eq. (B.5) in Appendix B, we restrict the phase-space integral\nregion to mbW > mb + mW . Note that the matrix-elements for mbW < mb + mW are very\nsuppressed. We set the W -boson decay-width to \u0393W = 2.05 GeV.\nIn Figs. 16, we plot three different distributions of kinematical variables constructed\nfrom the four-momenta of dileptons: (a1, a2)\nq the invariant-mass of the two leptons, (b1,\n\n2 + \u2206\u03c62 , and (c1, c2) the difference of\nb2) the distance in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, \u2206Rll = \u2206\u03b7ll\nll\nthe azimuthal angles, \u2206\u03c6ll . The first three graphs (a1, b1, c1) correspond to the events\nfrom all the mtt\u0304 region, while the last three (a2, b2, c2) to the events with mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV.\nThe solid lines represent our full prediction, and the dashed lines represent the Bornlevel predictions. To see the effects of the non-zero W -boson polarization, we also plot\nthe distributions computed from the bW + b\u0304W \u2212 events followed by the leptonic decays of\non-shell unpolarized W -bosons.\n\nWe find that, due to the bound-state corrections, all three distributions are shifted\nto the lower side, although the variations are fairly small even for the events with mtt\u0304 \u2264\n370 GeV. By contrast, the effects of the non-zero W -boson polarization is pronounced,\nespecially for the events with mtt\u0304 \u2264 370 GeV. The most evident difference can be seen\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\fin the \u2206\u03c6ll distribution, where the full calculation predicts that the number of events at\n\u2206\u03c6ll = 0 is more than twice than the number of events at \u2206\u03c6ll = \u03c0, while almost flat\ndistribution by assuming the unpolarized W -bosons.\nThis finding is consistent with the similar study in Ref. [17] where the importance\nof the top-quark spin correlation in the \u2206\u03c6ll distribution is examined for the events with\nmtt\u0304 \u2264 400 GeV. They compare the \u2206\u03c6ll distribution fully taking into account the top-quark\nspin correlation with that assuming the spherical top-quark decay into bW 's followed by the\ncorrelated W -boson decay. Our calculation assuming unpolarized W -boson decays includes\nthe correct angular distributions in t \u2192 bW decays, but forcing spherical distributions in\nW \u2192 l\u03bdl decays. Thus, to predict the dilepton observables, all the spin correlations in\ndecays of top-quarks and also W -bosons are required. We confirm their finding that the\ndifference in \u2206Rll distribution comes from mainly the difference in \u2206\u03c6ll distribution.\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Moch and P.
