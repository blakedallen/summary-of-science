These atoms are studied by a sensitive optical method based\non spectroscopy at a wavelength of 122 nm, exciting the 1S-2P transition. We present a direct\nmeasurement of the adsorption energy of deuterium atoms on helium and show evidence for the\nexistence of resonantly enhanced recombination of atoms residing on the surface to molecules.\n67.65.+z, 67.70.+n, 34.50.Dy\n\nprocesses (molecule formation) occur primarily on the\nsurface. Knowledge of both this binding energy as well\nas the rate constant governing the formation of molecules\nare essential ingredients for any experiment aiming at 2d quantum degeneracy. To date the values of both these\nquantities are not beyond controversy. It has been suggested [10] that the recombination rate on the surface\nin finite magnetic field may be dominated by a resonant\nprocess similar to what was predicted for free D atoms\n[11]. This assumption has never been properly tested.\nThe aim of this paper is threefold: firstly, to provide a direct measurement of the absorption energy of\na deuteron onto liquid helium, secondly to determine the\nrate constant for recombination (molecule formation) of\natoms residing on the surface as a function of magnetic\nfield, and finally to attempt to approach the regime of\nFermi-degeneracy in the adsorbate of D atoms as closely\nas possible.\nThe adsorption energy for H on the surface of liquid helium Ea /kB = 1.0K [8] is well established. For D the values reported in literature vary between Ea /kB = 2.6(4)\nK [7], measured in 8T, and Ea /kB = 3.97(7)K in a zerofield [10]. The discrepancy between these values is significantly larger than the accuracy of the measurements.\nA possible explanation was put forward in ref. [10]: It\nis suggested that the presence of one or more Feshbach\nscattering resonances may influence the measurement of\nEa when performed in high magnetic field. In fact, measurements reported in ref. [7] and [10] rely on the assumption that the \"cross length\" governing the formation of\nmolecules on the surface is independent of magnetic field\nand temperature. As we will explain below, this assumption may be wrong if Feshbach resonances are present.\nAll measurements of Ea presented in literature for D\natoms are based on a determination of the decay the\natomic gas due to recombination of adsorbed atoms. A\ndirect measurement of Ea has not been performed to\n\nTriggered by the first observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in atomic gases [1,2], there has been a\ngrowing interest in the investigation of quantum degenerate behaviour of fermionic atoms. Attention has focused\nmainly on magnetically trapped gases of the fermionic\nisotopes 6 Li and 40 K. The latter isotope was the first\natomic Fermi gas to be cooled to below the Fermi temperature [3].\nAn a priori candidate for the comparison between Bose\nand Fermi gases is the simplest atom of all: hydrogen\n(H), with its fermionic isotope deuterium (D). The appeal of these atomic gases lies both in the possibility of\ncryogenic precooling, which enables much larger samples\nto be cooled than with laser cooling techniques, and in\nthe existence of a natural two-dimensional quantum gas\non the surface of liquid helium. The H quantum gas\nhas been extensively investigated and quantum degenerate behaviour (BEC) has been reported both in three\ndimensions [4] and in the two-dimensional (2-d) adsorbed\ngas [5]. The first optical observation of H atoms in the\nadsorbed phase was reported in 1998 [6]. In that experiment Lyman-\u03b1 spectroscopy at a wavelength of 122\nnm was used to excite the 1S-2P transition in a surface\nspecific way. In this paper we will use Lyman-\u03b1 spectroscopy to investigate a three dimensional gas of atomic\ndeuterium in contact with D atoms adsorbed on the surface of liquid helium. Deuterium atoms are easily distinguished from the hydrogen atoms that are always present\nas impurities, because of the large isotope shift of about\n630 GHz.\nIn contrast to H, very few experiments with spin polarized D have been reported in the literature, mainly\nbecause spin-polarized D has been found to be significantly less stable than spin-polarized H and experiments\nare much harder [7\u201310]. The key reason for the low stability of D is the high adsorption energy Ea on the helium\nsurface which reduces the overall lifetime because loss\n1\n\n\fdate. Such a direct measurement relies on the following simple relation, valid when a three-dimensional gas\nis in equilibrium with an adsorbed two-dimensional phase\nin the nondegenerate (Boltzmann) limit:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nEa\n,\n(1)\nn2 = n3 \u039b exp\nkB T\nwhere n2 and n3 are the surface and bulk density, respectively, and \u039b = (2\u03c0h\u03042 /mkB T )1/2 is the thermal de\nBroglie wavelength. To obtain Ea using this equation\none needs to have experimental access to n2 and n3 simultaneously. Using optical spectroscopy we were able\nto measure n3 and to obtain a fluorescence signal proportional to n2 from the adsorbed atoms.\nFIG. 2. LIF and absorption spectra for D atoms for\nthe transition between the levels 1S1/2 ms = \u22121/2 and\n2P3/2 mj = \u22123/2, taken with \u03c3\u2212 polarized light. The full\nsymbols are data of the transmission through the cell and the\nbuffer. The solid line is a fit to the spectrum. The broad\nsaturated feature in the absorption spectrum is due to the\nbuffer atoms and the weaker satelite to the right is due to absorption by the atoms in the cell. The open symbols are the\nfluorescence due to bulk atoms in the cell. The signal of the\nsurface atoms is not visible in this plot. The noise in the absorption spectrum results from falling He dropplets due to the\nfountain effect caused by the temperature gradient between\nbuffer and cell. The parameters corresponding to the fits are:\nnb \u2248 6 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 , n3 \u2248 9 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 . The temperatures\nare Tb = 0.44 K, Tc = 0.26 K. The detuning is measured\nrelative to the center of the Lyman-\u03b1 spectrum for H atoms.\n\nI. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS\n\nWe first describe the experimental setup used for the\nexperiments with H and D adsorbed on He. The heart\nof this setup is shown in Fig. 1. A volume (called the\nbuffer) of approximately 30 cm3 is filled with D atoms,\nelectron spin polarized into their high-field seeking states.\nThese atoms are produced in a cryogenic discharge in\nhelium vapor operated at a temperature of about 0.8K.\nThe discharge cell contains solid D2 on the walls. These\nmolecules are dissociated while the helium discharge is\nrunning. The produced monoatomic gas flows towards\nthe buffer volume with a flux of typically 1012 \u2212 1013\ns\u22121 . We perform experiments while the discharge is running with the filling flux compensating the recombination\nlosses. With the discharge switched off the D gas decays\nin a few seconds due to the formation of D2 molecules.\n\nBelow the buffer volume there is a second volume called\nthe cell. The buffer is kept at a higher temperature than\nthe cell to reduce absorption of D on its walls. The atoms\nadsorb primarily on the surface of a layer of bulk helium,\nlocated at the bottom of the cell. The temperature of\nthe liquid helium is about 0.3K. The buffer temperature\nis typically between 0.4 and 0.45K. A strong field gradient (1.6 T/cm) in the cell pushes the atoms towards the\nhelium surface, a principle known as magnetic compression. The cell is separated from the buffer by a magnetic\nbarrier (a local field minimum) which limits the flux of\natoms from the buffer to the cell. The cell and buffer are\nmounted inside the bore of a superconducting solenoid\nwhich produces a magnetic bias field of between 4 and\n7 T. The magnetic compression and the barrier between\nbuffer and cell are created with cobalt-iron pole pieces\n(see Fig. 1). We control the flux \u03c6b\u2192c from the buffer\nto the cell by varying the temperature Tb of the buffer\nvolume. The flux is approximately given by:\n\nFIG. 1. Drawing of the experimental apparatus. The helium level and field profile are shown in the left panel. The\ncell is placed in a 7 T bias field. The magnetic pinch and compressor are cobalt-iron pole pieces producing a pronounced dip\n(the magnetic barrier) and a local maximum (at the helium\nsurface) in the magnetic field.\n\n\u03c6b\u2192c \u2248\n\n1\nnb v\u0304b Ab exp[\u2212\u03bcB (Bb \u2212 Bmin )/kB Tb ],\n4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere v\u0304b is the average thermal velocity of atoms in the\nbuffer and \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton. Bb and Bmin are the\nmagnetic fields in the center of the buffer and at the mag2\n\n\fnetic barrier, respectively. Ab is effective area of the aperture separating the buffer from the cell, which includes\nthe Clausing factor of the tube taking into account the\nstrong magnetic field inhomogeneity in the barrier region.\nFrom a Monte Carlo calculation we obtained Ab = 1.57\nmm2 . The net flux from buffer to cell is \u03c6b\u2192c \u2212 \u03c6c\u2192b\nwhere the back flux \u03c6c\u2192b is given by the same expression Eq.(2) but with nb replaced by the cell density n3 ,\nBb replaced by the field Bc at the bottom of the cell, and\nTb replaced by the cell temperature Tc . The velocity v\u0304c\nis evaluated at the cell temperature Tc in this case.\nA few words of clarification are needed about the\nmeaning of the cell density n3 . As in Eq. (1) we use\nthe subscript 3 (from 3-dimensional) for the cell density to distinguish it from the 2-dimensional density of\natoms adsorbed on the surface. However, in contrast\nto the buffer where the field is nearly constant, the\ncell has a field gradient and a concomitant varying density. We will understand n3 to mean the density just\nabove the surface. The density decreases with height\nabove the surface due to the strong field gradient, analogous to a barometric height distribution. We now introduce aR field and temperature dependent effective volume\nVe = V exp(\u03bcB [B(x) \u2212 B(0)]/kB T )d3 x. Here the integral is over the volume V of the cell and B(0) is the field\nat the bottom of the cell (i.e. at the helium surface). Ve\nis defined such that n3 Ve equals the number of atoms in\nthe cell.\nThe atoms in the buffer, the cell, and the adsorbed\nphase, can all be observed independently using Lyman\u03b1 spectroscopy. The light source we used to produce\ntunable narrowband 122 nm light is described elsewhere\n[6,12]. As can be seen in Fig. 1 the light beam passes\nthrough the apparatus from the bottom to the top. We\nmeasure both the absorption of the light as well as the\nlight-induced fluorescence (LIF) as a function of the incident light frequency. The atoms in the buffer are distinguished from those in the cell because they reside in\na different magnetic field and the resonance lines experience different Zeeman-shifts. The LIF of adsorbed atoms\ncan be distinguished from that of those in the vapor because the resonance lines are shifted by several hundred\nGHz relative to those of bulk atoms due to the interactions with the liquid helium.\n\nFIG. 3. Measured surface density in arbitrary units (left\nscale)\n\u221a and ratio of cell density and surface density multiplied\nby T in the cell. n2 varies only weakly in the temperature range shown, the buffer density decreases rapidly with\ndecreasing temperature. The solid points are used in the fit.\nThe open squares correspond to the temperature range were\nthe 2-d and 3-d systems become thermally decoupled due to\nfast surface recombination. The fit gives a direct measurement of the binding energy of 3.1 K.\n\nIn the deuterium case the broadening of the surface\nline is even larger than for H. We have indication that\nthe fluorescence is broadenend to more than 1 THz. We\ncould not detect a frequency dependence over the 100\nGHz lock range of our laser system and the fluorescence\nwas visible when a D atoms were present at all frequencies between the H spectrum and a blue detuning of 100\nGHz with respect to the D lines. We infer the surface\ndensity of D atoms by fixing the frequency of the light to\na value close to where the peak of the surface-LIF of the\nD atoms is expected, about 400 GHz to the red of the free\natom resonance. If there are adsorbed atoms this gives\nus a LIF signal proportional to the surface density. The\nvapor density above the surface n3 can be measured from\nthe LIF as well as from absorption spectroscopy at frequencies close to the free atom resonance. This is shown\nin Fig. 2. The fit to the LIF signal of the bulk atoms is\nbased on a single-scattering model, which is a good approximation at the relatively low densities involved. The\nmodel takes into account the Zeeman and Doppler effects\nand the thermal distribution of atoms in the cell. The\nshape of the curve is additionally influenced by the solid\nangle to the detector. The fluorescence detector can be\ncalibrated in an absolute way by comparing the fluorescence peaks with fits to the transmission spectrum. From\nthis fit we obtain an absolute value for n3 whereas n2 is\ndetermined up to a constant factor. We have made these\nmeasurements over a range of temperatures, so that we\ncan use Eq.(1) to directly obtain Ea /kB = 3.1(2) K. The\nresult is given in Fig. 3. The range of temperatures is limited from above by thermal instabilities (fountain effect)\nof the helium in our apparatus, causing excess noise on\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nIn this section we discuss the experimental results of\nspectroscopy of D atoms using Lyman-\u03b1 spectroscopy.\nThe technique allows us to infer the three crucial parameters in the problem: nb ,n3 , and n2 . The temperatures Tb\nand Tc are measured directly with resistance thermometers. In earlier studies with H atoms [6] it was found that\nthe LIF of the surface atoms takes the form of a broad\nfeature shifted about 300GHz to the red of the spectral\nline of free atoms in the bulk gas.\n\n3\n\n\fthe transmission and fluorescence detectors. At the low\u22121\nest temperatures (for 1/T >\n\u223c 4.5K ), there is no thermal\nequilibrium between the (quickly recombining) adsorbed\natoms and the bulk gas, and therefore Eq.(1) is not rigorously valid. We have discarded this temperature region\nfrom the fit. In Fig. 3. we also plotted n2 (in fact we\nplot the fluorescence signal). It can be clearly seen that\nthe temperature dependence is quite different from that\nof the ration n2 /n3 , which indicate that the fluorescence\nis not a spurious artifact due to bulk atoms.\nWe can also use Eq. (1) to determine the maximally\nobtained phase space density n2 \u039b2 , a measure of how far\nwe are from Fermi degeneracy. Although the measurement of n2 is not absolutely calibrated, the multiplicative\nfactor follows directly from Eq. (1). We find that at the\nlowest temperature Tc = 0.19K the phase space density\nis \u2248 10\u22122 . In 2-d this implies TF /T \u2248 10\u22122 where TF is\nthe Fermi temperature.\nThe value of Ea /kB = 3.1(2)K obtained from the fit\nin Fig. 3 is consistent with the 2.6(4) K measured by Silvera and Walraven [7] but lower than the value 3.97(7) K\nreported by Arai et al. [10]. In the latter paper it is suggested that the difference may be explained by the fact\nthat their experiment is performed in zero field whereas\nSilvera and Walraven use a field of 8T. The way in which\nEa is measured in both these experiments is by determining the decay rate of the gas. At sufficiently low\ntemperature this decay takes place almost exclusively\nby formation of molecules from adsorbed atoms on the\nsurface. Consequently the natural way to describe the\npopulation dynamics would be in terms of an inelasic\ncross length lDD governing the collisions between to adsorbed atoms which lead formation of a D2 molecule.\nThe rate of the process is proportional to n2 and to the\neffective surface area A2 on which the binary collisions\ntake place.\nThis surface is defined analogous to Ve as:\nR\nA2 = surface exp(2\u03bcB [B(x) \u2212 B(0)]/kB T )d2 x, where the\nintegral runs over the surface of the cell. The factor 2\nappears in the exponent because two atoms are involved\nin the formation of molecules. Both Ve and A2 depend\non temperature. Our recombination measurements are\nperformed at Tc = 0.3 K. At this temperature we have\nfor our cell: Ve = 0.015cm3 and A2 = 0.14cm2 .\nThe surface density is normally difficult to measure\nand as a consequence in the literature the decay is usually\ndescribed in terms of an effective bulk recombination rate\nconstant K. If we assume that the gas has no nuclear\npolarization (equal population of all high-field seeking\nhyperfine states) we may write: [9,10]:\n\u1e44 = \u2212Ve Kn23 ,\n\nFIG. 4. Rate constant for 2 body recombination (full symbols) at for Tb = 0.43K and Tc = 0.30K, compared to results\nfrom ref. 7 (triangle) and 9 (circle). The error margin on\nthe result from ref. 7 is the result of the exrapolation to\nour temperature. The solid circle and the dotted line are the\nmeasurement of ref. 11 at zero field and the extrapolation\nto finite fields, respectively. The solid curves are resonance\ncurves taken from ref. 10, scaled to appropriate strength and\nshifted to 3 and 5 T respectively.\n\nHere v\u0304 is the average thermal velocity of adsorbed\natoms. Eqs.(3) and (4) are based on the physical picture that atoms spend part of their time on the surface\nand that in equilibrium the fraction of particles on the\nsurface is determined by Eq.(1). In the exponent a factor\n2Ea appears because molecules are formed in pair collisions, hence the process depends on n22 . By measuring \u1e44\nand n3 as a function of T one in principle obtains values\nfor Ea and K. If one assumes that lDD is independent of\nB and T one obtains the following relation between the\nK in zero and finite fields [10]:\nK(B) =\n\n8\nK(0)\u03b52D ,\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b5D = aD /( 2\u03bcB B) with aD /h = 218 MHz the\nhyperfine frequency.\nThe way just described to determining Ea is plagued\nby the uncertainty weather lDD is in fact independent of\nB and T . Therefore we have independently measured Ea\nand lDD . We have measured the field dependence of K\nin the following manner: The discharge is kept running,\nproducing an approximately constant flux of D atoms.\nSome of the atoms recombine in the buffer volume but\nmost escape over the barrier to the cell. The buffer density is measured by fitting the absorption spectrum of\nthe buffer atoms. From this we calculate the escape flux\n\u03c6b\u2192c from buffer to cell according Eq.(2). From the fluorescence spectrum of the cell we calculate n3 which gives\nus \u03c6c\u2192b , which is generally much smaller than \u03c6b\u2192c . In\nsteady state the quantity \u1e44 in Eq. (3) is equal to the net\nflux into the cell \u03c6b\u2192c \u2212 \u03c6c\u2192b . From this, with Eq. (3)\nwe obtain the rate constant K. The result is plotted in\nFig. 4 as a function of B.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u1e44 is the decay of the 3-d gas in the cell. The\neffective two body decay rate constant K is given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2Ea\nA2 2\n.\n(4)\n\u039b\nexp\nK = lDD v\u0304\nVe\nkB T\n\n4\n\n\fAbove of a single resonance the rate will vary proportional to exp(\u2212g\u03bcB B/kB T ). The data vary slightly more\nsmoothly with B. It is to be expected that the free atom\nresonances are broadened in the presence of a helium substrate. One might expect a smearing of the same order of\nmagnitude as Ea , which would correspond to a width of\nmore than 4 T, enough to wash out any structure in the\nresonance spectrum. Another possibility is that motion\nof the singlet molecule coming off the surface engenders\na continuous spectrum of resonances for surface recombination. At any rate the strong observed field dependence\nsupports the idea of resonance recombination.\nThree other data points are included in Fig. 4. The\nmeasurement at 8 T taken from ref. [7], extrapolated\nto T = 0.3K using their measured temperature dependence and corrected for our value of A2 /Ve , is consistent\nwith the extrapolation of our data to higher field. The\nerror results from the uncertainty in the value for Ea\nquoted in ref. [7] which is reflected in the extrapolation\nto lower temperature. In fact our data indicate that the\ninfluence of the resonance hardly extends to a field of 8\nT which explains why the value for Ea /kB = 2.6(4)K\nfound in ref. [7] coincides with ours within the margin\nof error. The datapoints at 4.07T are taken from ref.\n[9]. We have extrapolated the measurements taken at\ntheir lowest temperature of 0.65K down to our cell temperture using two different values: 3.0 and 4.0 K, respectively, for the effective adsorption energy (asuming\nK \u223c T \u22121/2 exp[2Ea /kB T ] for the extrapolation). Both\ndatapoints obtained in this way from ref. [9] lie below\nours. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.\nIn conclusion, the strong field dependence of the recombination cross length of deuterium revealed by our\nmeasurements does point towards a resonance recombination process on the surface. In higher field the recombination rate rapidly becomes smaller. Our results\nindicate that at fields above the resonant region (roughly\nB > 8T) the recombination cross lengths may become\nsufficiently rather small to make adsorbed D nearly as\nstable as adsorbed H. Hence one might hope that the interesting configuration of a degenerate, two-dimensional\nFermi gas on the surface of a Bose liquid is attainable in\nthis way.\nWe are grateful to Pavel Bushev, Tycho Sonnemans,\nand Jook Walraven for fruitful discussions and comments.\nThis research is supported by the Stichting Fundamenteel\nOnderzoek van der Materie (FOM).\n\nSince the result may be thought to depend exponentially on thermometry errors, we took spectra of the H\nwhich occurs as an impurity in our deuterium, simultaneously. Since the H does not recombine quickly, it can\nbe used to check the balance of the fluxes: for H the\nflux into the cell must equal the return flux. We found\nthe ratio of the density of H atoms in the buffer and\nthe cell to be within the 30% accuracy of the measurement. This indicates that possible thermometry errors\n(due to e.g. spurious thermometer magnetoresistance)\ncannot contribute more than a factor \u2248 2 error to the\nmeasured field dependence while the data cover several\norders of magnitude over the measures field range.\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nIn Fig. 4 we compare our data to values obtained\nby other groups. The dotted line in the figure is an\nextrapolation to finite magnetic field of the zero field\nmeasurement of Arai et al. [10]. We have scaled their\nzero field measurement to correspond to our temperature (the cross in Fig. 4). To extrapolate their measurement to finite fields we used Eq. (5). All data compiled\nin Fig. 4 have been rescaled to correspond to our value\nof A2 /Ve = 9cm\u22121 . It is clear that our data lie well\nabove the curve of Arai et al. Moreover, there is a much\nstronger dependence on magnetic field. This can not be\ndue a spurious effect of electron-spin relaxation as for\nour field range and temperature this lies many orders of\nmagnitude below our measured range of K values. It was\nsuggested in ref. [10], on the basis on an analogy with the\nsituation for free D atoms [11], that K may be enhanced\nin finite field due to Feshbach resonances. Such a resonance occurs when the energy of a highly excited state of\nthe singlet molecule coincides with the energy of triplet\npair of deuterons in the high field seeking state; the two\nchannels are then coupled by the hyperfine interaction.\nNear such a resonance we may write K as:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2Ea \u2212 2\u03bcB B + ED\nA2 \u039b4\n.\n(6)\nexp\nKres =\nVe \u03c4\nkB T\nHere ED denotes the dissociation energy of a singlet\nmolecule into a pair of adsorbed atoms. Expression (6) is\nvalid for fields higher than ED /2\u03bcB . The reaction time \u03c4\ncharacterizes a two-step process: the formation of the excited singlet state molecule followed by its decay to lower\nlying levels.\nFor free D atoms two Feshbach resonances, 2 T apart,\nin which the rovibrational levels (v, J) = (21, 0) and\n(21, 1) of D2 are involved, were predicted [11] in field\nrange relevant for this experiment. This suggests that\nwe compare our data with with curves corresponding to\nEq.(6). Two such curves are plotted in Fig. 4 at the\nsomewhat arbitrarily chosen field values of 3 and 5 T\n(with the vertical scale adjusted to match the data best).\n\n[1] M.H. Anderson, J.R. Ensher, M.R.
