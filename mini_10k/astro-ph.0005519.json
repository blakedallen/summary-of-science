By making use of the definition \u03c1 = \u03c1ef f \u2212 2\u03c0G\u03c3 2\nand p = pef f \u2212 2\u03c0G\u03c3 2 allow us to write the conservation equation in Einstein-Cartan\nGravity [4] as\nd\n(\u03c1R3 ) = \u22123pR2\ndR\n2\n\n(0.6)\n\n\fThese substitutions allow us to reduce our problem of computing density perturbations\nformally similar to the general relativistic one.The necessary assumption to make our task\neasier is to consider the pressure p vanishes which yields\npef f = 2\u03c0G\u03c3 2\n\n(0.7)\n\nWith these assumptions equation 0.6 reduces to\nd\n(\u03c1R3 ) = 0\ndt\n\n(0.8)\n\nwhere now we are ready to apply the traditional perturbation method on the cosmological\ndensity perturbation by making use of the following definitions\n\u03b4=\n\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1b\n\u03c1b\n\n(0.9)\n\nand\na = R(t) + \u03b4R(t)\n\n(0.10)\n\n\u03b4\u03c3 2\n)\n\u03c32\n\n(0.11)\n\nand\n\u03c3 2 = \u03c3b2 (1 +\n\nHere the index b denotes background quantities.From the equation (0.8) one obtains\n\u03b4 = \u22123\n\n\u03b4R\nR\n\n(0.12)\n\nfollowing the lines and procedures of General Relativity we find the following evolution\nequation yields\n\u03b4\u0308 + 2H0 2 \u03b4\u0307 + 10\u03c0 2 G2 \u03c3b 2 \u03b4 = 0\n\n(0.13)\n\nTo solve this differential equation we need to compute the background spin-torsion density.This can be easily accomplished if one equates equations (0.2) and (ref3) and substitute (0.7) to obtain\n9\n\u03c1ef f = \u03c0G\u03c3b 2\n2\n\n(0.14)\n\nSubstitution of this last expression into the conservation equation for the effective density\nyields\n\u03c3 \u0307b 2 + 3H0 \u03c3b 2 = 0\n3\n\n(0.15)\n\n\fwhich solution is\n\u03c3b 2 = e\u22123H0 t\n\n(0.16)\n\nto simplify matters without loosing too much physical insight one could assume that the\nspin-torsion background can be expanded in the form\n\u03c3b 2 = (1 + 3H0 t)\u22121 = (3H0 t)\u22121\n\n(0.17)\n\nwhere we have made the hypothesis H0 t >> 31 .Substitution of this result into expression\n(0.13) yields the final form of the evolution equation ready now to be solved\n\u03b4\u0308 + 2\u03b1\u03b4\u0307 + \u03b3\nwhere \u03b1 = 2H0 2 and \u03b3 =\n\n\u221210\u03c0G\n.To\n3H0\n\n\u03b4\n=0\nt\n\n(0.18)\n\ndeduce the evolution equation (0.18) we assumed that\n\nthe perturbed metric is the de Sitter metric where H0 is a constant.To solve this evolution\nequation let us assume as usual a solution of the type \u03b4 = tm where m is a real constant\nto be determined from an algebraic equation.Substitution of this hint into the differential\nequation (0.18) yields the following algebraic equation\nm2 + (1 + \u03b1)m + \u03b3 = 0\n\n(0.19)\n\nthe solution of this last equation left us with two solutions of the type \u03b4+ = tm+ and\n\u03b4\u2212 = tm\u2212 where m+ and m\u2212 are the respective elementary solutions of the algebraic\nequation (ref19). Recently Maroto and Shapiro [5] have discussed the stability of de\nSitter metric on a higher order derivative gravity with torsion.They basically showed that\nthe stability of de Sitter metric depends on the dimension of the space with torsion we\nconsider therefore it is interesting to see what happens here in 4D spacetime.Here we\nshow that is possible to extract important physical information on the stability of de\nSitter metric by using the perturbation method discussed in the last section.To this aim\nwe consider the following perturbation on the de Sitter metric\nH = H0 + \u03b4H\n\n(0.20)\n\nSubstitution of this equation into the Friedmann equation after some algebra yields to\nthe first order\n\u03b4H =\n\n5\u03c0G\n\u03c1b \u2212 2\u03c0G\u03c3b\n=\nm\nH0 t\n2H0 2 tm+1\n4\n\n(0.21)\n\n\fThis expression can be recast in the form\n\u03b4H =\n\n5\n\u03c0G\u03c3b\n2\nH0 tm\n\n=\n\n5\u03c0G\n2H0 2 tm+1\n\n(0.22)\n\nwhich shows that the perturbation of the de Sitter metric will depend explicitly on the\nbackground spin-torsion density.\n\nAcknowledgements: I am very much indebt to Professor Ilya Shapiro for his\nconstant advice.Financial support from CNPq (Brazilian Government Agency) and UERJ\nare gratefully acknowledged.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G.Bochner,The Early Universe,(1993)Springer-Verlag,Berlin.\n[2] J.P.Peebles,Principles of Physical Cosmology,(1994),Princeton University Press.\n[3] D.Palle,Primordial density fluctuations in Einstein-Cartan gravity and COBE data,grqc electronic archives,(1998).\n[4] L.C.Garcia de Andrade,Phys.Lett.B468,(1999),28.\n[5] A.Maroto and I.L.Shapiro,Phys.Lett.B414(1997)34.\n\n6\n\n\f"}
