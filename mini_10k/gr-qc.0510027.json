This\nformulation must be different from the familiar one (which is normally carried out by\nconsidering Bogoliubov transformations), since it yields quantum amplitudes relating to the\nfinal state, and not just the usual probabilities for outcomes at a late time and large radius.\nOur approach simply follows Feynman's +i\u01eb prescription. Suppose that, in specifying the\nquantum amplitude to be calculated, initial data for Einstein gravity and (say) a massless\nscalar field are specified on an asymptotically-flat space-like hypersurface \u03a3I , and final\ndata similarly specified on a hypersurface \u03a3F , where both \u03a3I and \u03a3F are diffeomorphic\nto R3 . Denote by T the (real) Lorentzian proper-time interval between \u03a3I and \u03a3F , as\nmeasured at spatial infinity. Then rotate: T \u2192 |T | exp(\u2212i\u03b8) , 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 . The classical\nboundary-value problem is then\nto become well-posed on a region of topology\n\u0002 expected\n\u0003\nI \u00d7 R3 , where I is the interval 0, |T | . For a locally- supersymmetric theory, the quantum\namplitude is expected to be dominated by the semi-classical expression exp(iSclass ), where\nSclass is the classical action. Hence, one can find the Lorentzian quantum amplitude from\nconsideration of the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0+ . In the usual approach, the only possible such final\nsurfaces \u03a3F are in the strong-field region shortly before the curvature singularity; that is,\none cannot have a Bogoliubov transformation to a smooth surface 'after the singularity'.\nIn our complex approach, however, one can put arbitrary smooth gravitational data on\n\u03a3F , provided that it has the correct mass M ; thus we do have Bogoliubov transformations\nto surfaces 'after the singularity in the Lorentzian-signature geometry' - the singularity\nis simply by-passed in the analytic continuation (see below). In this Letter, we consider\nBogoliubov transformations in our approach, and their possible relation to the probability\ndistribution and density matrix in the traditional approach. In particular, we find that\nour probability distribution for configurations of the final scalar field cannot be expressed\nin terms of the diagonal elements of some density-matrix distribution.\n1. Introduction\nIn [1-4], based on the thesis [5], we described a calculation of the quantum amplitude\nfor an initial spherically-symmetric configuration of gravity and a massless scalar field \u03c6\nto make a transition to another nearly-spherically-symmetric configuration at a very late\n(1)\nLorentzian time T , apart from some weak perturbations (hij , \u03c6(1) )F . The boundary data\nare specified on an initial and a final asymptotically-flat hypersurface \u03a3I,F , and the time\nT is measured at spatial infinity. The Lorentzian-signature space-time metric g\u03bc\u03bd (\u03bc, \u03bd =\n0, 1, 2, 3) has spatial components hij = gij (i, j = 1, 2, 3) on surfaces with t = x0 = const.,\n1\n\n\fsuch as \u03a3I and \u03a3F . This transition could refer to the quantum evaporation of a black hole,\nfollowing gravitational collapse from a slowly-moving, diffuse, spherical configuration. The\nfinal configuration could refer to the nearly-spherical stream of (massless) radiation, and its\ncorresponding Vaidya-like gravitational field [6,7], as viewed on a space-like hypersurface\n\u03a3F , of topology R3 , which cuts through all the radiation. The weak perturbations on \u03a3F ,\nin the present field language, correspond to emitted particles.\nThe calculation proceeds following Feynman's +i\u01eb prescription [8]. If T is rotated\ninto the complex: T \u2192 |T | exp(\u2212i\u03b8), for 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 , then the classical boundaryvalue problem, given the above nearly-spherically-symmetric boundary data, is expected\nto become well-posed [1].\nFor a simple example (cf. [10]), consider the 2-dimensional Euclidean-space Laplace\nequation\n\u22022\u03c6\n\u2202 2\u03c6\n+\n= 0 ;\n0 < \u03c4 < T , \u2212 \u221e < x < +\u221e ,\n(1.1)\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\u2202x2\nsubject to boundary data of the form (say)\n\u03c6(\u03c4 = 0, x) = 0 ,\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4 = T, x) = \u03c61 (x) ,\n\n(1.2)\n\non the 'initial and final surfaces'. Here, the boundary data given by \u03c61 (x) should be\nthought of as a C \u221e function, of rapid decrease as |x| \u2192 \u221e .\nLet \u03a61 (k) denote the Fourier transform of \u03c61 (x) :\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u03a61 (k) = \u221a\ne\u2212ikx \u03c61 (x) dx .\n(1.3)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nThen the (unique) solution of the real elliptic Dirichlet boundary-value problem (1.1,2)\nabove is given by\nZ \u221e\n1\nsinh(k\u03c4 )\n\u03a61 (k) dk .\n(1.4)\n\u03c6(\u03c4, x) = \u221a\neikx\nsinh(kT )\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nIn common with any solution of an elliptic partial-differential equation with analytic coefficients, \u03c6 is automatically a (real- or complex-) analytic function of both arguments \u03c4\nand x [9].\nOne can then rotate the Euclidean proper-distance-at-infinity into the complex: T \u2192\nT exp(i\u03b8) , where 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 . The Laplace equation (1.1) still holds, although it is\nperhaps more natural to view it with respect to coordinates (y\u03b8 , x), where y\u03b8 = \u03c4 exp(i\u03b8),\nin which case the potential \u03c6 is, for each fixed \u03b8, a (complex) solution of the complexified\nLaplace equation\n\u2202 2\u03c6\n\u2202 2\u03c6\ne2i\u03b8\n+\n= 0.\n(1.5)\n\u2202y\u03b8 2\n\u2202x2\nProvided that 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 , this differential equation is strongly elliptic in the language of\n[11]. We continue to pose the same boundary data (1.2), with \u03c6 = 0 on the initial surface\ny\u03b8 = 0 , and with\n\u03c6(y\u03b8 = T, x) = \u03c61 (x)\n(1.6)\n2\n\n\fon the final surface y\u03b8 = T [equivalently given by \u03c4 = T exp(\u2212i\u03b8)]. The corresponding\ncomplexified solution \u03c6(y\u03b8 , x) of this boundary-value problem still exists and is unique,\nprovided always that 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 , being given by the analytic continuation of Eq.(1.4):\n\u0001\nZ \u221e\n\u0010\n\u0011\nsinh\nk\ny\nexp(\u2212i\u03b8)\n1\n\u03b8\n\u0001\neikx\n\u03c6 \u03c4 = y\u03b8 exp(\u2212i\u03b8), x = \u221a\nsinh k T exp(\u2212i\u03b8)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a61 (k) dk .\n\n(1.7)\n\nProvided that 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 , the denominator in the integrand of Eq.(1.7), namely\nsinh kT e\u2212i\u03b8\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= cos kT sin \u03b8 sinh kT cos \u03b8 \u2212 i sin kT sin \u03b8 cosh kT cos \u03b8 ,\n\n(1.8)\n\nis non-zero for all k 6= 0 . By examining a small neighbourhood of k = 0 , one sees that\nboth numerator and denominator have simple zeros at k = 0 , whence the integrand in\nEq.(1.7) is well-behaved for all k . In this way, it can be shown that the integral (1.7)\nprovides the (unique) solution of the boundary-value problem, for 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 .\nOn the other hand, for the exactly Lorentzian case with \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 , one can see that\nno solution exists for the Dirichlet boundary-value problem, for typical choices of the final\nboundary data \u03c61 (x), or equivalently of its Fourier transform \u03a61 (k). This is because,\nfollowing the representation (1.4), one now has sin(kT ) for the denominator, rather than\nsinh(kT ). The existence of a (smooth) Lorentzian solution \u03c6(t, x) would then imply that\n\u03a61 (k) vanishes for all those values of k , namely, for all k = n\u03c0/T (n a positive or negative\ninteger, excluding the case n = 0), such that sin(kT ) vanishes. A typical \u03c61 (x) will not\nhave \u03a61 (n\u03c0/T ) = 0 for a single value of n (integer, 6= 0). This argument can be refined, to\nshow rigorously the non-existence of a solution to the above (non-trivial) Dirichlet problem\nfor the flat wave equation. Thus, in this example, the Dirichlet boundary-value problem\nfor the wave equation is badly posed.\nIn [1] and in this paper, we study the field-theoretic analogue of the boundary-value\nproblem above, with data specified on an initial and a final spacelike hypersurface, with\neither a (Riemannian) proper distance at spatial infinity, T , between the surfaces, or a\ncomplex-rotated separation T exp(i\u03b8), where 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 . For simplicity, we consider Einstein gravity coupled to a massless scalar field \u03c6 , and first restrict attention to sphericallysymmetric configurations, as giving a large number of 'background' or 'reference' spacetimes describing gravitational collapse to a Schwarzschild black hole in Lorentzian signature\n[12,13]. The metric is taken (without loss) in the form (2.1) below; the corresponding scalar\nfield is of the form \u03c6(t, r). In Riemannian signature, the Einstein field equations are given\nin [14].\nAs yet, very little is known rigorously in the theory of partial differential equations\nabout existence and uniqueness for this boundary-value problem \u2013 even for the purely real\nRiemannian case with a spherically-symmetric 3-metric (hij )I,F and scalar field (\u03c6)I,F\nspecified on the initial and final hypersurfaces, and a real proper-distance separation T\ngiven at spatial infinity. In the limit of weak boundary data, and hence, via the classical\nRiemannian field equations, also of weak fields in the interior, one would expect fixedpoint methods, analogous to those used in [15], to establish existence and uniqueness for\nthe Riemannian boundary-value problem. This weak-field Riemannian problem has also\n3\n\n\fbeen investigated numerically [14]. For weak scalar boundary data, global quantities such\nas the mass M and Euclidean action I appear to scale quadratically, in accordance with\nanalytic weak-field estimates [16].\nConsidering still the real Riemannian case, there does not 'experimentally' appear to\nbe any obstacle to extending the above (good) results numerically to strong boundary data,\nexcept for the ever-larger amounts of computer time required. It may be that a typical\npattern will emerge numerically for the general 'shape' of the classical gravitational and\nscalar fields, in the limit of strong-field boundary data. In that case, it might be possible\nto find analytic approximations for the strong-field limit (quite different from those valid\nin the weak-field case), which could provide a large amount of further analytical insight\ninto the solutions of the strong-field Riemannian boundary-value problem. It is, of course,\nsuch strong-field boundary-value problems which are of most interest, when we consider\nrotating: T \u2192 T exp(i\u03b8), with 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 , towards a Lorentzian time-interval.\n\nThe strong-field limit for this boundary-value problem is expected to correspond, in\nthe Lorentzian limit in which \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from below (although \u03b8 never attains\nthe value \u03c0/2), to classical spherically-symmetric Einstein/scalar solutions which form a\nsingularity, surrounded by a black hole. As described in the Abstract above, one expects\nthat arbitrary smooth gravitational and scalar data can be posed on the final spacelike\nhypersurface \u03a3F , allowing for a rotation into the complex of the Riemannian distanceseparation T (> 0) between \u03a3I and \u03a3F , of the form T \u2192 T exp(i\u03b8), with 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 , and\nprovided that \u03a3F has the correct mass M . The (real) magnitude T could then be chosen\narbitrarily large, corresponding to a non-singular complex solution of the Einstein/scalar\nfield equations between \u03a3I and a final hypersurface \u03a3F at late time. In this sense, in\nthe complexified solution, one expects to have Bogoliubov transformations to surfaces \u03a3F\nwhich are 'after the singularity in the Lorentzian-signature geometry', provided always that\none does not take the limit \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 . In the same sense, one may say that 'the singularity\nis simply by-passed in the analytic continuation'; by analogy with the scalar-field example\nof Eqs.(1.1-8) above, there should be an analytic complexified classical solution to the\nboundary-value problem, which only reaches a singular boundary precisely at Lorentzian\nsignature (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2). Provided that one retains the freedom to rotate T into the complex\n(as was insisted upon also by Feynman [8] in his +i\u01eb prescription), one has the possibility\nof circumventing Lorentzian singularities by deforming time-intervals suitably into the\ncomplex, much as one avoids singularities of functions f (z) in the ordinary complex zplane.\nFor the more general Einstein/scalar boundary-value problem, in which one allows for\nweak non-spherical perturbations in the boundary data (hij , \u03c6)I,F , the (complex) classical\n(1)\naction Sclass can be studied as a functional of the perturbative final data (hij , \u03c6(1) )F and\na function of the complex variable T , if for simplicity we regard the spherically-symmetric\ninitial data (hij , \u03c6)I as fixed. The classical action Sclass can be calculated, and thence the\nsemi-classical amplitude, proportional to exp(i Sclass ). Finally, the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0+ can be\ntaken, yielding the Lorentzian amplitude.\nThis description is clearly very different from that usually adopted for black-hole\nevaporation [17-20], which involves the study of Bogoliubov transformations between an\n4\n\n\fearly- and a late-time surface, where the late-time surface passes inside the black-hole event\nhorizon, close to the curvature singularity. The standard approach yields probabilities for\nconfigurations of outgoing particles, and a late-time density matrix, but not quantum\namplitudes for states defined typically by weak data over an R3 surface at late times. as\nin the present case. It is intended, in this Letter, to make some contact between these\ntwo approaches, even though our approach addresses a wider class of questions than does\nthe usual approach. In particular, we show how the Bogoliubov transformation between\nour two R3 -surfaces \u03a3I and \u03a3F can be described in terms of the quantities appearing\n2\nin [2,3] (see also [1]). The Bogoliubov quantities |\u03b2s\u03c9lm | for the original calculation of\nblack-hole radiance [17] agree with those found by the above boundary-value approach,\nto high accuracy (Sec.3). In Sec.4, we consider the resulting probability distribution for\nconfigurations of the perturbative scalar field \u03c6(1) on the final surface \u03a3F . It is found\nthat this probability distribution cannot be expressed in terms of the diagonal elements of\nsome density-matrix distribution; thus, the correspondence between our approach and the\ndensity-matrix approach of [18] is limited.\n2. Bogoliubov transformations between R3 surfaces\nAs in [1-4], we write the Lorentzian-signature classical 'background' metric in the form\nds2 = \u2212 eb(t,r) dt2 + ea(t,r) dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nFor later reference, we also define the 'mass function' m(t, r) by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2m(t, r)\n.\nexp \u2212a(t, r) = 1 \u2212\nr\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn the boundary-value problem outlined above, let us write (\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6) for the 'background'\nspherically-symmetric metric and scalar field. Writing also \u2207\u03bc for the background covariant derivative, consider a linearised classical solution \u03c6(1) of the scalar wave equation\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03c6(1) = 0 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nConsider a basis {f\u03c9\u2032 lm (x)} of (nearly-) separated mode solutions adapted to \u03a3I and\nanother such basis {p\u03c9lm (x)} adapted to \u03a3F . On \u03a3I , the {f\u03c9\u2032 lm } are chosen to be an\northonormal, complete family of complex solutions of the wave equations, which contain\nonly positive frequencies (\u03c9 \u2032 > 0). Correspondingly for the {p\u03c9lm } on \u03a3F .

For convenience of visualisation, one might wish to regard\nthe angle \u03b8 as being extremely small. Nevertheless, one only takes \u03b8 \u2192 0+ at the end of\nthe calculation. Thus, this Section deals with a larger class of Bogoliubov transformations\nthan those appearing in the usual formulation.\nThe bases above may be chosen to have the form\n\u03c6\u03c9lm (x) = N (\u03c9)\n\nR\u03c9l (r) \u2212i\u03c9t\ne\nYlm (\u03a9) ,\nr\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere N (\u03c9) is a normalisation factor. On \u03a3I , we require \u03c6\u03c9lm \u221d e\u2212i\u03c9v at large r, where\nv = t + r \u2217 and where r \u2217 \u223c rs\u2217 , with\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nrs\u2217 = r + 2M ln r/2M \u2212 1\n(2.7)\ndenoting the Regge-Wheeler radial coordinate [21,22] in an exactly Schwarzschild geometry\nof mass M . On \u03a3F , we require \u03c6\u03c9lm \u221d e\u2212i\u03c9u at large r, where u = t \u2212 r \u2217 . Thus, the\n{f\u03c9\u2032 lm } are purely ingoing at infinity, while the {p\u03c9lm } are purely outgoing.\nSince the {f\u03c9\u2032 lm } give a complete orthonormal set on \u03a3I , a typical basis function\n(solution) p\u03c9lm on \u03a3I may be expanded as\np\u03c9lm =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c9 \u03c9lm f\u03c9 lm + \u03b2\u03c9 \u03c9lm f\u03c9\u2032 l,\u2212m ,\n\u2032\n\n0\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe sets of complex numbers {\u03b1\u03c9\u2032 \u03c9lm } and {\u03b2\u03c9\u2032 \u03c9lm } are the Bogoliubov coefficients, and\nthe standard properties of Bogoliubov transformations are, for example, given in [13].\nIn our treatment [1-5] of linearised scalar perturbations \u03c6(1) (x), propagating at late\ntimes through the Vaidya-like region containing outgoing black-hole radiation, almost all\nmodes are adiabatic. That is, a general solution of Eq.(2.1) in this region can be built\nup from separated solutions of the form (2.6), with \u03c9 = \u2212k and R\u03c9l (r) \u223c \u03bekl (r) .

Probabilities and density matrices\nFollowing from the Lorentzian quantum amplitude calculated in [1-5], for perturbative\nspin-0 data given on the final surface \u03a3F , while taking (for simplicity) exactly sphericallysymmetric 'background' data on \u03a3I , one finds the corresponding conditional probability\ndensity over the final perturbative scalar boundary data \u03c6(1) |\u03a3F , given that \u03c6(1) |\u03a3I = 0 .\nFor a large (real) Lorentzian time-interval T , this is\n\u0012\nh\ni\nh\ni\u0013\n(2)\n\u2212\u03b4|T |MI\nP {aklm }; |T | = N\u0302 e\nexp \u22122 Im Sclass {aklm }; |T | ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nh\ni\n(2)\nwhere N\u0302 is a suitable normalisation factor.

But, given the thermal nature of black-hole evaporation in the usual description, one\ncan still ask whether the probability distribution can be viewed in terms of the diagonal\nelements of some density matrix in a suitable basis [18-20].

In our example, if the field is in\nthe kj -th state, then N\u0302 exp(\u2212Xj ) Lkj (2Xj ) is the 'probability density' for the 'harmonic\noscillator coordinate' Xj . We then obtain the statistical 'probability' distribution (4.9)\non multiplying by the probability P (kj ) to be in the kj -th state, then summing over all\npossible states kj . This gives an interesting way of regarding the probability distribution\n(4.9),\na sensible density matrix, based on the quantum amplitude\n\u0010 but it\u0002does not provide\n\u0003\u0011\n(2)\nexp i Sclass {aklm }, T\nof [3-5]. This shows that the density-matrix approach, based\nconceptually on linearised quantum field theory around a classical space-time, does not\napparently replicate the results of a fully quantum approach (at least, not in the locallysupersymmetric case).\n5. Conclusion\nHere, we have made some connection between the boundary-value approach of [1-5]\nto calculating quantum amplitudes for generic late-time configurations defined (say) on\nR3 , which involves a rotation of the time-at-infinity: T \u2192 |T | exp(\u2212i\u03b8) into the complex,\nand the familiar Bogoliubov-coefficient approach to calculating probabilities in black-hole\nevaporation, with a final hypersurface near the space-time singularity. In the case that\nboth the initial and the final space-like hypersurfaces \u03a3I , \u03a3F have the topology of R3 , there\n10\n\n\fis a relation between the Bogoliubov transformations in the two different approaches. The\n2\n|\u03b2s\u03c9lm | quantities for the original (Bogoliubov) calculation of black-hole radiance and\nfor the topologically-R3 approach agree, at least very closely. However, the probability\ndistribution calculated from the 'R3 ' quantum amplitude cannot be expressed in terms of\nthe diagonal elements of some density-matrix distribution, so supporting the view that the\ntwo approaches are genuinely different.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are very grateful to the referee, first, for suggestions which helped greatly to\nclarify the distinction between our complex-time approach and the traditional approach,\nand, second, for other more detailed comments.\nReferences\n[1] A.N.St.J.Farley and P.D.D'Eath, Phys Lett.
