Let\ni\u03c9 n \u2192 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03b4 , we can get the self-energy of the\nexcitations (electrons). However, we are not\ninterested in the concrete forms of these functions in\nthis letter, but in the related problems to\nsuperconductivity.\nFirstly, compared with BCS theory, the excitation\nenergies from the pairs with non-opposite\nmomentum include the contribution of \u03b5 (k , \u03c9 ) , this\nis from the moves of the center of pairs. Obviously,\nthis is more reasonable to describe the excitations in\nsuperconducting states.\nSecondly, because there are pairs with\nnon-opposite momentum, so there may be the d-p\npairs in cuprate superconductors, the pairs from\nnearly localized holes combining with nearly free\nholes. These pairs may have short length pairing\norders, but they should affect the properties of\nsuperconductors, such as the pseudogap behavior.\nThirdly, it is necessary to note that the excitation\nenergies determined by (5) and (6) have the virtual\nparts, so the \"electrons\" and pairs have not the\nso-called long-life. It also means that the\nsuper-currents are always exchanging energies with\ntheir environments. The excitation energies in BCS\ntheory are real, and it seems that the \"pairs\" are\nnever separated off and the supper-currents are\n\"cold and dead\". In fact, the BCS theory could not\nexplain why pairs would be separated.\n+\n\nFourthly, we can find that if F ( k , k , i\u03c9 n ) are\n+\n\nzero, F (k + q, k , i\u03c9 n ) must be zero on the basis\nof (5) and (6), hence the pairing temperature is the\nsame for the pairs with opposite momentum and\nwith non-opposite momentum. That is to say, the\nprediction of BCS for the superconducting\ntemperatures of normal metals may be correct.\nMoreover, our results may give evidences for\npossible localized pairs, an electron moves around a\nnearly localized electron, which do not contribute to\nsuperconductivities. We must point that the energies\nfrom \"separated pairs\" should be decomposed into\n\ntwo parts, one is from the pairs with non-opposite\nmomentum, and I think that they may be usually\nconsidered as a \"background\" in experiments.\nIn summary, consider the pairs with non-opposite\nmomentum, we find that the excitation energies are\ndifferent from the one in literatures, this must affect\nour knowledge on the physics of superconductors.\n\n\f"}
