Numerical Relativity (NR) is concerned with the study\nof numerical solutions of the Einstein's equations for the gravitational field ([4]), and\nPermanent address : The West University of Timi\u015foara, Theoretical and Computational Physics\nDepartment, B-dul V. P\u00e2rvan no. 4, 1900 Timi\u015foara, Rom\u00e2nia, e-mail : vulcan@physics.uvt.ro\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fwhen we apply these equations to cosmological models we have numerical cosmology as\na branch of NR. Einstein equations are an extremely complicated system of coupled,\nnon-linear, partial differential equations and solving them numerically makes enormous\ndemands on the processing power and memory of a computer. The Cactus code ([5])\nhas been mainly designed as a computational toolkit (freely available for the scientific\ncommunity) for simulating different systems of partial differential equations, as Einstein\nequations are The code can be used to simulate fully 3-dimensional systems with strong\ngravitational fields: collapsing gravitational waves, colliding black-holes, neutron stars,\nand other violent astrophysical processes generating gravitational waves.\nAs a branch of NR, numerical cosmology can use the Cactus code for his purposes. Although Einstein field equations reduce to a small number of equations in most cosmological\nmodels ([7]-[8]), trying to simulate more complex models (as models with cosmological\nconstant or having matter fields coupled with gravity) it becomes difficult to compose\nspecial numerical codes for every specific case. Thus our purpose was to develop a piece\nof code to be used inside a general numerical machinery for solving Einstein equations,\nas the Cactus code is. This article is a report on how we extended the Cactus code\nfor numerical cosmology. In this purpose we developed a new thorn of the Cactus code\n(\"thorns\" are called the computer code packages embedded in Cactus code for some specific application). The starting point of this new thorn, called \"Cosmo\" was an existent\nthorn of the Cactus code (the \"Exact\" thorn) previously reported in ([6]) for testing the\nCactus code on exact solutions of the Einstein equations.\nWe investigated some cosmological models being exact solutions of the Einstein equations in our previous article ([6]). Here the scale factor of the universe (R(t)) and thus the\ncomponents of the metric tensor gij are known analytic function of time, given in the code\nat the initial time as initial data. But in our new Cosmo thorn, the main point is that we\nhave to use the general Robertson-Walker metric, having the scale factor of the universe\n(R(t)) as a unknown function to be evolved during the time evolution of the Einstein\nequations through the Cactus code. Thus the only job to be done by the Cosmo thorn is\nto provide good initial data (that means at the initial time t0 considered the actual time\nof the universe, for example) and then let the Cactus code to solve the Einstein equations\nthrough the time. In addition it is necessary to prescribe convenient boundary values\nfor the functions and variables involved. This is necessary because the Cactus code has\na limited boundary methods implemented, not appropriate for our numerical cosmology\npurposes.\nThe article is organized as follows : the next section 2, presents some general facts\nabout the way we built the Cosmo thorn, how we solved the problems exposed above\nand the necessary theoretical cosmology background. Section 3 is dedicated to a matter\n2\n\n\fdominated universe model based on Robertson-Walker metric ([7]), with pressure-less\nmatter - \"dust\" and without cosmological constant. Models with cosmological constant\nare presented in the next section 4 where we concentrated again only on models having\nmatter as a pressure-less dust. A wide larger class of possible initial data is possible\nincluding the so called \"coasting cosmologies\", models not having as a starting point a\nBig Bang. In all cases studied and reported in this article we investigated the convergence\nand the stability of the Cactus code, in the same way we presented in detail in [6].\nAs a major conclusion we have to point out the good second order convergent and\nstable behavior of the code, even in the cases we studied both forward and backward\ntime evolutions. Future perspective are open for developing this thorn for inflationary\nmodels. It is in our view to study those models having one or more scalar field coupled\nwith gravity to control the behavior of the model and to simulate an accelerated late time\nevolution, actually called \"cosmic acceleration\" being well proved experimentally in the\nlast years. Thus together with other similar thorns being in preparation at AEI, we shall\nhave a new class of applications for the Cactus code, a major instrument for new studies\nin numerical cosmology and in cosmology, in general.\nBeing included in the list of thorns of the Cactus code, actually the files for our thorn\nare available by request, directly at the author's e-mail address and in the near future it\nwill be included in the CVS repository of the Cactus code (see [5]) for free download.\nThe simulations were performed mainly on single processor machines, using both the\nAEI computer network (SGI or Dec machines with UNIX operating system) and a Pentium III machine with a UNIX FreeBSD operating system at the West University of\nTimi\u015foara. Some of the simulations, with similar results, were also done on the Origin\n2000 supercomputer at the AEI.\nThrough this article and in the Cactus code we shall use geometrical units with G =\nc = 1.\n\n2\n\nThe Cactus code, the Robertson-Walker metric\nand the Cosmo Thorn\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, in modern cosmology we are using the Robertson-Walker metric\n(RW), namely ([7]-[8])\nds2 = \u2212c2 dt2 + R(t)2\n\n\"\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 )\n1 \u2212 kr 2\n3\n\n#\n\n(2)\n\n\for in isotropic coordinates :\ni\nR(t)2 h \u20322\n\u20322\n2\n2\n2\ndr\n+\nr\n(d\u03b8\n+\nsin\n\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n)\nds = \u2212c dt +\n(1 + k4 r \u20322 )2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nr\u2032 =\n\n2r\n\u221a\n1 + 1 \u2212 kr 2\n\nas a generic metric for describing the dynamics of the universe through the Einstein\nequations (1). Here k is a constant with arbitrary value, positive (for closed universes),\nnegative (for open universe) and zero for flat universes. Usually, this constant is taken 1,\n\u22121 or 0 respectively. When we consider all the matter in the universe as a perfect fluid,\nthe stress-energy tensor may be given as\nTij = (\u01eb + p)ui uj + pgij\n\n(4)\n\nand is necessary to prescribe a state equation, i.e. a relation between the pressure p and\nthe density of the universe \u03c1. For matter dominated universes usually the pressure is\np = 0 and this will be the case we concentrated in our simulations.\nAs our main purpose was to build a new thorn for the Cactus code, generically named\nfrom now one \"The Cosmo thorn\" for evolving the RW metric above in all three cases for\nk = \u22121, 0 and +1. The main problem was to to \"convince\" Cactus to evolve, without\nhaving the time behavior of R(t) function (actually, R(t) is a function of the thorn).\nAlthough we used the same strategy as in the above mentioned Exact thorn (see [6])\nhere, not having an analytic function of time for R(t) the solution was to provide Cactus\ncode all initial data he needs, namely R(t) and \u1e58(t) = dR(t)/dt at the initial time t0 we\nchoose ! As a result, new routines were added for calculating the extrinsic curvature [3]\ncomponents at the initial time, namely :\nK\u03b1\u03b2 = \u22122R(t)2\n\n\u1e58(t)\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 = \u22122R(t)2 H(t)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\nR(t)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere H(t) is the Hubble constant function (!). Note that we have here as lapse\nfunction, N = 1 and a shift vector as N\u03b1 = 0, \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 as always in RW cosmology.\nAnother item we concentrated on was the boundary problem : - Cactus code and the\nthorns which solve numerically the Einstein equations (namely ADM BSSN and ADM\n- see [5]) have not implemented proper boundary conditions for the RW metric. In our\n4\n\n\fprevious article [6] on Exact thorn we used \"flat\" boundary condition but this is not\nappropiate here ! To solve this problem we used a simple hint : R(t) and H(t) are\nfunctions of time only, thus they are constant on the numerical grid at one time, having\nthe same value inside the grid and on the boundary. As a result, we added a new boundary\nmethod through a new value of the parameter bound of the ADM BSSN thorn (see [5]\nand [6]), called external which activates some new routines we composed in this purpose,\nhaving as a generic name recover. In these routines the spatial metric components g\u03b1\u03b2\nand the extrinsic curvature components K\u03b1\u03b2 on the boundaries are \"recovered\" from the\nvalues of the R(t) and H(t) on the interior points by calculating them using equations\n(2) and (5). Also these new boundary conditions are necessary during the intermediate\nsteps of integration used by ADM BSSN thorn in the so-called \"IterativeCN.F\" routine\n(where a three steps Cranck-Nicholson integration method is applied). For this purpose\nwe slightly modified the \"IterativeCN.F\" routine for \"injecting\" our specific \"recover\"\nboundary values. Actually this was possible through a facility of the Cactus code which\nmakes possible to call different routines from different thorns using special \"include\"\ncommands (see [5]).\n\n3\n\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmologies\n\nBy \"FRW cosmologies\" we mean those cosmological models based on the above RW metric\nand being solutions of the Einstein equations (1) without cosmological constant (\u03bb = 0) see for example ([7]) and ([8]). Restricting ourselves only to matter dominated universes\n(i.e. p(t) = 0) as we mentioned earlier, and solving the conservation law of the perfect\nfluid which emulates the matter, we have for the stress-energy tensor components\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 and T00\n\nc2 C\n=\nR(t)3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere C is a constant depending on the the mass density of the universe at the initial\ntime t0 . Solving the Einstein equations for this constant and at the initial time t0 where\nR(t0 ) = R0 and H(t0 ) = H0 , we have\nC = \u03a90 \u03c1c R03 = 2q0 \u03c1c R03 = q0 c2\n\n3H02R03\n4\u03c0GR(t)3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere q0 is the deceleration parameter at the initial time, i.e.\nq(t) = \u2212\n\nR\u0308(t)\nH(t)2 R(t)\n5\n\n(8)\n\n\fand \u03a90 is the so-called density factor, defined as\n\u03c10\n\u03a90 =\n\u03c1c\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c10 being the initial density of the universe and \u03c1c the critical density (i.e. the density of\na flat three-dimensional universe where k = 0). It is proven ([8]) that we have :\n\u03a90 = 2q0\n\nand \u03c1c =\n\n3H02\n8\u03c0G\n\n(10)\n\nIn order to provide initial data for the Cactus code we need to solve the Einstein equations\nat the initial time for the initial Hubble constant H0 (to calculate the values of the extrinsic\ncurvature through equation (5)) and for the initial scale factor R0 . It is known that we\nhave here three solutions, depending on the geometric factor k = 0, 1, \u22121. Thus, for k = 0\n(flat three-dimensional spacetime) where\nq0 =\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\n\u03a90 = 1\n\nwe have (see ?? eq. 4.37)\n\n2\n(11)\n3t0\nand we shall take R0 = 1, as a value for calculating, for now one the relative scale factor,\ni.e. R(t)/R0 which will be our numerical output. For the case of closed universe, k = 1\nwe have\nH0 =\n\nq0 >\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\n\u03a90 > 1\n\nIn this case (as in the next one for k = \u22121) we do not have an analytic solution for the\nscale factor, but for the initial time t0 we can easily obtain that (?? eq. 4.51) :\n!\n#\n\"\n\u221a\nq0\n2q0 \u2212 1\n1\n\u22121 1 \u2212 q0\nH0 =\n\u2212\n*\ncos\n(12)\n3/2\n(2q0 \u2212 1)\nq0\nq0\nt0\nand the initial scale factor is :\nR0 =\n\nH0\n\n\u221a\n\nc\n2q0 \u2212 1\n\nFinally, for the open universes (k = \u22121) where we have\nq0 <\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n6\n\n\u03a90 < 1\n\n(13)\n\n\fAs it is shown ([8] eq. 4.64), here we have :\n!#\n\"\u221a\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 2q0\nq0\n1\n1 \u2212 q0 + 1 \u2212 2q0\nH0 =\n*\n\u2212 ln\n3/2\n(1 \u2212 2q0 )\nq0\nq0\nt0\nand the initial scale factor is :\n\n(14)\n\nc\n(15)\nH0 1 \u2212 2q0\nWith these results reminded, we can now proceed to explain how we produced our simulations. Taking as initial data the initial time (t0 ) in billion years, being an internal\nparameter of the Cactus code, namely CCTK intitial time, we then have all the variables (in our geometrical units with c = G = 1, of course) rescaled in billion years.\nWe also have the initial value of the deceleration parameter, q0 denoted in the code as\nrobson q. As output we have the scale factor, more precisely the relative scale factor\nR(t)/R0 (denoted in the code as raza ) and the Hubble parameter function H(t) (denoted\nin the code as hubble. For evolving these two functions we produced two internal routines of the thorn, which mainly calculates their values from the general output values\nprovided by the Cactus code and the ADM BSSN thorn (as the extrinsic curvature and\nthe three-dimensional metric components).\nHere we shall present the results we obtained on evolving a matter dominated universe\n(i.e pressure-less matter, p = 0) based on the RW metric. Some explanations are necessary\nin order to clarity our figures ( see also ([6])). Here and in the next figures, \"normalized\"\nmeans the L2 norm of the respective function calculated using all the values of the function\non the computational grid at one time and the respective output Cactus files are denoted\nwith nm2 extension.\nCactus code is evolving the Einstein equations using the 3+1 decomposition of spacetime (both in ADM or BSSN evolution methods -see ([3]) and ([10])). Thus the Einstein\nequations can be split in two groups : the dynamic equations (for the time derivatives of\nthe three-dimensional metric and extrinsic curvature) and the constraint equations (the\nHamiltonian constraint and the Momentum constraint) - see [1] and [3]. The constraint\nequations are satisfied during all time evolution of the system. Thus one of the main tests\non the convergence in the Cactus code is given by the time behavior of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint (an output of the Cactus code through a thorn called ADMConstraints, namely\nham). In some of the next figures (here and in the next sections) we show the convergence\nof the L2 norm of the Hamiltonian constraint for different number of iterations, using two\ndifferent resolutions on the grid, one with 143 and the second with 283 points (both grids\ncover the same region of spacetime, so the grid with more points has a smaller value of the\nfinite difference interval \u2206x). Notice that the Hamiltonian constraint for a true solution\nR0 =\n\n\u221a\n\n7\n\n\fFlat Friedmann unverse (p=0, k=0)\n\nClosed FRW universe (k=1, p=0)\n\nConvergence test (100/200 iterations)\n\nConvergence test (1000/2000 iterations)\n\n1.00e\u221210\n\n0.0008\n14\n28\n\n0.0007\n8.00e\u221211\n0.0006\n\n14\n28\n\n0.0005\n\nham_nm2\n\nham_nm2\n\n6.00e\u221211\n\n0.0004\n\n4.00e\u221211\n0.0003\n\n0.0002\n2.00e\u221211\n0.0001\n\n0.00e+00\n\n20\n\n20.5\n\n21\ntime (billion years)\n\n21.5\n\n0\n\n22\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\ntime (billion years)\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFigure 1: Convergence test for FRW flat matter dominated universe (k=0, p=0) for\n100/200 iterations (left side) and for FRW closed matter dominated universe (k=1, p=0)\n1000/2000 iterations (right side)\n\n8\n\n\fof the Einstein equations should be equal to zero. Finite differencing errors imply that\nthe numerical solution will have a non-vanishing value of the Hamiltonian constraint. For\na consistent finite difference approximation of the Einstein equations, we should expect\nthe Hamiltonian constraint to approach zero as the resolution is increased. For a second\norder approximation, the value of the Hamiltonian constraint should go down by a factor\nof four when the resolution is doubled. This was the method to test the convergence of\nthe code in all examples presented in this article. We have obtained good second order\nconvergence in all examples as is shown in the next figures.\nFirst of our figures (1 and 2) are pointing out the convergence of the code for different\nexamples of FRW cosmologies. The time is scaled in billion years (as for all figures in\nthis section) starting with an initial time of 20 billion years. As it is obvious from these\nfigures a good second order convergence is visible, even for long time evolutions. For the\ncase of the closed universe (k = 1) we had to restrict our simulations only till around\n9000 iterations (for a grid with 143 points) because in this case the universe is evolving\nto a Big Crunch (opposite to the Big Bang) as it is pointed out in the right panel of the\nnext figure (3). Here the scale factor is evolving to a maximum having the value\nRmax =\n\nc\n2q0\n*\n3/2\n(2q0 \u2212 1)\nH0\n\ntwice of the actual value R0 (we used here q0 = 1). For spatially flat universes we used,\nof course, q0 = 0.5 and for open universes we had q0 = 0.25.\nFigure (3) contains also in his left panel the evolution of the Hubble parameter function\nin time. We plotted here, for convenience the modulus of this function being calculated\nthrough the L2 norm as is output by the code.\nThe same comment is valuable for the left panel of the figure (4) where we can point\nout also the coincidence of the minimum zero value of the Hubble parameter with the\nmaximum of the scale factor from the previous figure (3). The right panel of (4) is\ndedicated to the simultaneous plot of the three cases, pointing out the differences between\nthe geometries of the three models.\nLast of our figures from this section, (5) contains the plots of the relative scale factor\ntime evolution for different closed matter dominated FRW universes, having different\ndeceleration parameter (i.e. different density parameters). It is visible here that as the\ndeceleration parameter (density parameter) is increasing so is decreasing the time-life of\nthe closed universe between a Big-Bang and a Big-Crunch.\n\n9\n\n\fOpen FRW universe (k=\u22121, p=0)\n\nConvergence test\n\nConvergence test (1000/2000 iterations)\n\nOpen Friedmann model (k = \u22121, q =1 )\n\n3e\u221205\n\n3e\u221205\n3\n14\n3\n28\n\n14\n28\n\n2e\u221205\n\nham_nm2\n\nham_nm2\n\n2e\u221205\n\n1e\u221205\n\n0\n\n1e\u221205\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\ntime (billion years)\n\n35\n\n0\n\n40\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\ntime (billion years)\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 2: Convergence test for FRW open matter dominate universe (k=-1, p=0) for\n1000/2000 iterations (left side) and for 9000 iterations (right panel)\n\n4\n\nFRW cosmologies with cosmological constant\n\nHere we shall deal with cosmologies based on the above RW metric but having a nonvanishing cosmological constant. In spite of the failure of the the initial tentative of\nEinstein to use the cosmological constant as a trick to fit general relativity with, at\nthat time presumed, static universe, the cosmological constant is again used in modern\ncosmology in order to establish more realistic models of the universe, as the inflationary\nmodels and, recently, the so called cosmic acceleration. Early attempts (see ([9])) on\nusing numerical routines for solving the Einstein equations for these models were reported.\nBecause our goal is to implement in the Cactus code a thorn for doing similar simulations,\nbut on a larger scale and fully three-dimensional we shall refer to these previous results\nonly for comparing our results. Meanwhile we shall use here the same notations and\nscaling of the parameters as in ([9]) for prescribing the initial data sets for the Cactus\ncode.\nThis time I will proceed in a slightly different way than in the previous section, scaling\nall our variables and parameters in terms of the initial value of the Hubble parameter\nfunction H0 , which is not completely free in our universe, having been measured to within\n\n10\n\n\fOpen Friedmann universe (k=\u22121, p=0)\n\nClosed Friedmann universe (k=1, p=0)\n\nTime evolution of the Hubble function\n\nTime evolution of the scale factor (9000 iterations)\n\n0.04\n\n2\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\nraza_nm2\n\nhubble_nm2\n\n0.035\n\n0.03\n\n1.4\n\n0.025\n1.2\n\n0.02\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\ntime (billion years)\n\n35\n\n1\n\n40\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\ntime (billion years)\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFigure 3: Time evolution of the Hubble function for FRW open matter dominated universe\n(k=-1, p=0) 1000/2000 iterations (left panel) and of the relative scale factor for for FRW\nclosed matter dominated universe (k=+1, p=0) 9000 iterations (right panel)\n\n11\n\n\fClosed Friedmann universe (k=1, p=0)\n\nFriedmann matter dominated universes\n\nTime evolution of the Hubble function (L2 norm, 9000 iterations)\n0.03\n\nTime evolution of the relative scale factor\n8\n\n6\n\nraza_nm2\n\nhubble_nm2\n\n0.02\n\n4\n\n0.01\n2\nk=\u22121\nk= 0\nk= 1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\ntime (billion years)\n\n150\n\n0\n\n200\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\ntime (billion years)\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 4: Time evolution of the Hubble function (L2 norm) for FRW closed matter\ndominated universe (k=+1, p=0) 9000 iterations (left panel) and the time evolution of\nthe relative scale factor for FRW matter dominated universes (p=0, k=+1,0,-1) 9000\niterations (right panel)\n\n12\n\n\fClosed Friedmann universes (k =1)\nTime evolution of the relative scale factor\n2\n\nRelative scale factor\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\nq=1\nq=2\nq=3\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\ntime (billion years)\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFigure 5: Time evolution of the relative scale factor for for different closed matter dominated FRW universes (k=+1, p=0) 9000 iterations\na factor of 2. Thus for the cosmological constant \u03bb for instance, we use \u03bb/H02 as a\nbasic parameter, denoted in the code with robson l. Of course, for dimensional scaling\nreasons we prescribed at the initial time H0 = 1. Thus, for example, at the output we have\nthe relative value of the Hubble function H(t)/H0 . Meanwhile we need a parameter to\ndescribe the density of the universe, and this time we used \u03a90 instead of the deceleration\nparameter (remark that here we have no more the relation \u03a90 = 2q0 ). We have also the\nGaussian curvature K(t) defined as\nK(t) =\n\nk\nR(t)2\n\nwhich will be, of course identical to the geometric factor k at the initial time when we\ntake the initial scale factor R0 = 1 as we done in our simulations. Following the line\nindicated in ([9]) we can define the density factor as\n\u03a9(t) =\n\n8\u03c0G \u03c1(t)\n3 H(t)2\n\nand at the initial time \u03a90 =\n\n8\u03c0G \u03c10\n3 H02\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the initial density of the matter in the universe. Now solving the Einstein\nequations at the initial time and after some algebraic manipulations we obtain (for c =\n13\n\n\fG = 1, R0 = 1) :\nK0 = k =\n\nH02\n\n1 \u03bb\n\u03a9\u22121+\n3 H02\n\n!\n\n(17)\n\nand for the stress-energy tensor (where we included also the term containing the cosmological factor, as we did in ([6])) :\nTij = Tij0 \u2212\n\nc4\n\u03bbgij\n8\u03c0G\n\n0\nwhere T00\n=\n\n3\nR3\n\u03a90 H02 0 3\n8\u03c0G\nR(t)\n\n0\n; T\u03b1\u03b2\n=0\n\n\u2200\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 (18)\n\nNow our numerical results are pointed out in the next figures. First we show, in figure (6)\nthe time evolution of the scale factor for some cosmological models, having the density\nfactor \u03a9 being 0.1 (left panel) and 1.0 (right panel). The models are differentiated by\ntheir respective cosmological constant (more precisely the factor \u03bb/H02). For the time\nscale we used here Hubble time units, i.e. the time is expressed as t/tH where tH is the\nHubble time : tH = H0\u22121 . In these simulations, as in the next ones we started from the\nactual time (taken here t0 = 0) and we investigated the time behavior of the model in\nboth directions of time, forward, as well as backward in time.\nNext figure (7) shows, in his left panel some special cases of FRW models with cosmological constant, where the scale factor shows off a different evolution : namely it starts\nsomewhere back in time with a certain finite value, it decreases in time, then it has a\nperiod (longer or shorter) of constant value, evolving finally as an expanding model (of\nDe-Sitter type, for example). These models, having a period of constant value of the scale\nfactor, are sometimes called \"coasting cosmologies\" and are investigated as an alternative\n(realistic or not) to the standard Big-Bang model, not being generated from a Big-Bang,\nas can be seen from our simulations. The right panel of the figure (7) contains the time\nevolution of the Hubble constant function (the L2 norm, as it is output by the Cactus\ncode, otherwise the values after the null minimum value being negative ones) for a model\nwith \u03a9 = 0.1 and \u03bb/H02 = 5.\nWe must point out that we performed here also several convergence tests, as in the\nprevious section, obtaining again good second order convergence. As an example we shall\npresent in the last figure (8) the convergence test for 143 and 283 points on the grid for a\nmodel having again \u03a9 = 0.1 and \u03bb/H02 = 5 for an evolution forward in time (left panel)\nand backward in time (right panel).\n\n14\n\n\fFriedmann models with cosmological constant\n\nFriedmann models with cosmological constant\n\nDensity parameter 0.1\n\nDensity factor 1\n\n15\n\n4\n\n\u22123\n0\n3\n6\n\nRelative scale factor (L2 norm)\n\nRelative scale factor\n\n10\n\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\n0\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n0\n1\nCosmic time (in Hubble time units)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n1\n2\nCosmic time (in Hubble time units)\n\n3\n\nFigure 6: Time evolution of the scale factor for FRW models with cosmological constant.
