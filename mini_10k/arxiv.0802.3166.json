It scales with the critical temperature Tc over a wide doping range and displays a significant temperature dependence below Tc in both the underdoped and the overdoped regimes of\nthe phase diagram. In contrast, the antinodal gap component does not scale with Tc in the underdoped side and appears to be controlled by the pseudogap amplitude. Our experiments establish\nthe existence of two distinct gaps in the underdoped cuprates.\nPACS numbers: 74.25.Dw, 74.72.-h, , 78.30.-j\n\nIn cuprate superconductors the critical temperature Tc is strongly dependent on the carrier concentration (the\ndoping level, p) and exhibits a domelike shape with two distinct regimes (overdoped and underdoped). It is now\nestablished that the superconducting gap has a dominant d-wave symmetry across the entire superconducting dome\n[1]. The superconducting gap reaches its maximum value along the antinodal directions and vanishes along the nodal\ndirections corresponding respectively to the principal axes and the diagonal of the Brillouin zone.\nRecent experiments have revealed a strong dichotomy between the nodal and the antinodal components of the gap\nin the superconducting state [2, 3, 4, 5]. While the gap amplitude close to the nodes (\u2206N ) continuously tracks Tc , the\nantinodal one (\u2206AN ) is no longer proportional to Tc and its 2\u2206AN /kB Tc ratio blows up in the underdoped regime.\nA compilation of the experimental data (electronic Raman scattering (ERS), angle resolved photoemission (ARPES),\nneutron, tunneling and heat conductivity) which reveals this dichotomy is reported elsewhere [6].\nThese results raise the question of \"one or two gaps \" in the cuprates [7, 8, 9, 10]. In the two gaps scenario, a small\ngap (close to the nodes) is related to superconductivity whereas a larger one (at the antinodes), called the pseudogap,\ncorresponds to a phenomenon distinct from superconductivity and may compete with it.\nA set of recent experiments [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] suggests that the antinodal gap is indeed disconnected from\nsuperconductivity in the underdoped regime. The antinodal gap does not scale with Tc , becomes very weakly temperature dependent and even slightly increases as the temperature reaches Tc . These observations are in contradiction\nwith what is expected for a BCS-like behavior as observed deep in the overdoped regime.\nSince the antinodal component fails (at least in the underdoped side) to reproduce the behaviour expected for\na superconducting order parameter, many efforts have been recently devoted to probe the temperature dependence\nof the nodal component. This issue is the center of an intense debate as recent ARPES experiments have yielded\ncontradictory results. One group argues that the superconducting gap is essentially temperature independent over\nthe whole k-space including the nodal region [17] while another group argues that the amplitude of the gap near the\nnodes shows a well-defined BCS temperature dependence [12].\nA clear identification of the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap is therefore of paramount importance. The superconducting nodal component is a priori a good candidate to feel superconductivity because\nits amplitude scales with Tc throughout the entire superconducting dome as demonstrated by Raman scattering\nexperiments on a wide range of cuprates [11, 18, 19].\nProbing the nodal gap structure as a function of temperature is challenging precisely because close to the nodes the\ngap amplitude vanishes. Moreover, the nodal gap structure is expected to be very sensitive to any thermal excitations\nand/or disorder inducing pair breaking which makes difficult the extraction of the bare gap function.\nIn spite of such experimental difficulties, we bring here the first Raman experimental evidences that the nodal gap\namplitude is temperature dependent in the overdoped and the underdoped regimes. In both regimes the nodal gap\nenergy decreases as the temperature is raised and disappears at Tc . In sharp contrast, the antinodal gap component\nexhibits a distinct temperature dependence as a function of the doping level. It is not detected at low doping level.\n\n\f2\nIt is non temperature dependent (or weakly increases as the temperature is raised) below the optimal doping while\nin the overdoped regime it shows strong temperature dependence consistent with a conventional BCS behavior.\nOur results favor a scenario in which the nodal gap component remains continuously connected to superconductivity\nas the doping changes while the antinodal component is only related to superconductivity in the overdoped regime.\nThey imply the existence of two gaps in the superconducting state of underdoped cuprates in agreement with recent\nARPES [12, 16] and tunneling measurements [4, 20, 21].\nWe have probed the nodal and antinodal components of the gap by performing an ERS study on HgBa2 CuO4+\u03b4\n(Hg-1201) single crystals as a function of both temperature and doping level (from p = 0.25 to 0.09). Hg-1201 has\none single CuO2 layer by unit cell and its doping level is controled by insertion of oxygen atoms in HgO layer. The\nERS experiments have been carried out using a triple grating spectrometer (JY-T64000) equipped with a nitrogen\ncooled CCD detector. The nodal (B2g ) and antinodal (B1g ) regions have been explored by using cross polarizations\nalong the Cu-O bond directions and at 45o from them respectively [22]. The red (1.9 eV ) excitation line was used to\nprobe both the nodal and antinodal components of the gap. The reason is that we have experimentally found that\nthe ERS nodal gap peaks are sharper when using the 1.9 eV line compared to higher energy lines. This is possibly\ndue to a sharper (B2g ) Raman vertex function near the nodes. All the Raman spectra presented here were corrected\nfor the spectrometer response, the Bose factor and the optical constants and thus show the imaginary part of the\nRaman response function \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9).\nIn Fig. 1, are displayed the nodal (B2g ) and antinodal (B1g ) Raman response functions in the superconducting\nstate substracted from the Raman responses just above Tc , \u03c7\u2032\u2032S (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c7\u2032\u2032N (\u03c9) for two different doping levels p = 0.11\n[(a) and (b)] , and 0.20 [(c) and (d)] corresponding respectively to Tc = 75 K (underdoped) and 85 K (overdoped).\nThe insets show the unsubstracted superconducting and normal response functions: \u03c7\u2032\u2032S (\u03c9) and \u03c7\u2032\u2032N (\u03c9).\nIn the overdoped case (p = 0.20), Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), strong temperature dependences of the nodal and antinodal\nsuperconducting structures are observed. The B2g spectrum exhibits a peak close to 375 cm\u22121 at T = 10 K which\nsoftens in energy and decreases in intensity as the temperature raises before disappearing at Tc . Simultaneously,\nthe low energy continuum (the negative part of the spectrum) fills in agreement with the transfer of spectral weight\nusually detected in the Raman spectra of high Tc cuprates [11, 23]. The description is quite similar for the antinodal\nRaman response except that the antinodal gap is higher in energy (405 cm\u22121 ) than the nodal one as expected for a\nd-wave gap. We detect a similar energy softening between 10 K and 70 K of about 25 \u00b1 5 cm\u22121 for both the nodal\nand antinodal components.\nIn the the underdoped case (p = 0.11), Fig. 1(c) and 1(d), the most salient feature is that the nodal and antinodal\nRaman responses become drastically distinct. The nodal component is temperature dependent and shows an energy\nsoftening of about 25 \u00b1 5 cm\u22121 similar to the one in the overdoped regime. In contrast the antinodal response is flat\nwith no trace of electronic superconducting component. The antinodal Raman responses do not show any difference\nup to 1000 cm\u22121 (see inset of Fig. 1(d)) [24]. This confirms our previous results [2, 25] which revealed that the\nantinodal Raman response is reduced before disappearing completely below p = 0.12.\nThe temperature dependence of the nodal component for several doping levels (two underdoped p = 0.10 and\np = 0.11 and one overdoped p = 0.20) is reported in Fig. 2. The temperature dependence of the antinodal component\nat p = 0.13 is also shown for comparison. We observe that even at relatively low doping level (p = 0.10) the\nnodal component is temperature dependent with an energy softening of about 20 \u00b1 5 cm\u22121 whereas the antinodal\ngap component at p = 0.13 displays a slight upward shift as Tc is approached. However we can notice that the\ntemperature dependence of the nodal component for the three doping levels does not follow the evolution expected for\na d\u2212wave BCS gap [26] (see Fig. 2). One of the main reason is that contrary to ARPES which probes quasi-particles\nin a single direction of momentum space, ERS spectroscopy probes a small but finite region around the nodes whose\nextension is essentially controlled by the shape of the B2g Raman vertex function. We therefore expect (especially\nfor underdoped or slightly overdoped measurements) the pseudogap which develops at the antinodes to contaminate\nthe temperature dependence of the B2g Raman response function around the nodes. An estimation of the pseudogap\ncomponent deduced from the temperature evolution of the antinodal component as a function of doping level will be\nadressed just below. It will appear that the pseudogap component (measured close to T = Tc ) is still sizeable in the\nsligtly overdoped side and only disappears in the strongly overdoped regime. Other causes could also be invoked such\nas disorder which induces pair breaking and produces a thermally activated low energy quasi-particle peak. Such a\npeak is expected to broaden with temperature and can mask the temperature dependendence of the nodal component\njust below Tc .\nIn order to quantify the pseudogap component as a function of the doping level, we have re-analysed our recent\ndata [11] (see insert of Fig. 3) using a very simple model proposed by Loram et al. [7]. We have postulated that\nthe antinodal component \u2206AN has two contributions: the bare superconducting gap \u2206S which dominates in the\noverdoped side and the pseudogap \u2206P G which is prominent in the underdoped side. This leads to the following\n\n\f3\np\nexpression for the amplitude of the antinodal gap component: \u2206AN (T ) = (\u2206S (T ))2 + (\u2206P G (T ))2 where \u2206S (T ) is\nconsidered as a BCS gap and therefore vanishes at Tc .\nFrom this equation it appears that only the \u2206P G term subsists at Tc . By extrapolating the location of the Raman\nantinodal peak at Tc from the temperature dependence of the antinodal Raman response as a function of doping level\n(shown in the inset of Fig. 3), we can estimate \u2206P G (T = Tc ) over a wide doping range. The pseudogap component\nnormalized to Tc (full triangles) is plotted in Fig. 3. Below p \u2248 0.12, the pseudogap energy is hard to evaluate\ndue to the weakness of antinodal Raman response intensity (see Fig. 1(d)) which is a consequence of the antinodal\nquasiparticle destruction induced by the pseudogap phase [2, 25, 27, 28]. The doping dependences of the nodal (full\ncircles) and antinodal (full squares) gap components normalized to Tc are also reported. They have been respectively\ndeduced from the B2g and B1g Raman spectra measured at T = 10K.\nAt first glance Fig. 3, reveals that the superconducting nodal component follows Tc for all the doping levels with\n2\u2206N /kB Tc \u223c 6.4 (Fig. 3). This contrasts with the antinodal superconducting component whose ratio departs from the\nnodal one and blows up close to optimal doping. The \u2206AN \u2212 \u2206N splitting occurs when the pseudogap ratio measured\nat Tc crosses the nodal one. ERS data do not allows us to directly probe the pseudogap ratio at low temperature\n(T \u226a Tc ). However we can infer from the \u2206AN \u2212 \u2206N splitting that the pseudogap at T = 10 K becomes significant\nbelow the optimal doping level. The pseudogap increases in magnitude and controls the antinodal component below\np \u2248 0.16. In this regime the antinodal component is then progressively disconnected from superconductivity while\nthe nodal one exhibits the same behavior throughout the superconducting dome.\nIn this picture the departure of the nodal component temperature dependence (shown in Fig. 2) from a BCS-like\ntemperature dependence can be explained by a contribution of the pseudogap amplitude which would increase as\nthe temperature is raised up to Tc . This last effect is suggested by the experimental data in the inset of Fig. 3 and\nrecent ARPES data [12]which reveal an increasing of the antinodal component as the temperature is raised in the\nunderdoped regime.\nIn conclusion our experimental findings establish the nodal component as a good candidate for the superconducting\norder parameter over a wide range of doping. The amplitude of the nodal gap shows a significant softening upon\nincreasing temperature and scales with Tc throughout the superconducting dome. By contrast the antinodal component of the gap is disconnected from superconductivity in the underdoped regime where it is largely controlled by the\npseudogap amplitude. The physical origin of the pseudogap \u2206P G remains an important issue that we have to tackle\nin order to understand the mysterious evolution of the antinodal component as a function of doping level.\n\n\f4\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n\nC.

The insets in\npannels (a), (c) and (d) show the superconducting and normal Raman responses separetly. All the Raman responses have been\nobtained with the red (1.9eV ) excitation line. The doping value p is inferred from Tc using equation of Presland et al from Ref.\n[29]: 1 \u2212 Tc /95.5 = 82.6 (p \u2212 0.16)2 .
