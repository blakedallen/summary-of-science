The rystal-\u001celds splittings (\u2206CF ) of the 4f level in the heavier monopni tides (CeBi and CeSb) are onsiderably smaller than in the lighter Ce\nmonopni tides (CeAs, CeP). This behaviour was previously studied and understood by\nWills and Cooper [1\u2104. The dominant ontribution to the splittings in these monopni tides an be obtained from the point- harge (PC) model whi h is appropiate for\ninsulators or ioni systems. This PC model alone an a ount for the CF splittings\nof Rare Earth monopni tides when the Rare Earth goes from Pr to Tb but it fails to\ndes ribe Ce monopni tides be ause in Ce ompounds the 4f-band hybridization annot\nbe negle ted.\nWills and Cooper onsider that the total \u2206CF in these CeX systems is the result of\ntwo independent ontributions with di\u001berent sign: the extrapolated value from the PC\nmodel with non-hybridized 4f levels and the splittings indu ed by hybridization. The\nformer gives rise to positive splittings whi h in rease from Bi to P. In the ubi point\ngroup, the multiplet J =\n\n5\n2\n\nde omposes into the | 52 ; \u03937 i doublet and the | 52 ; \u03938 i quar-\n\ntet. So that a positive splitting means that \u03937 is the ground state. They al ulate\nthe 4f hybridization fun tion out of the ondu tion band density of states whi h is ob2\n\n\ftained from \u001crst prin iples, using the linear mu\u001en-tin-orbital (LMTO) method and the\nself- onsistent potential within the atomi -sphere approximation (ASA) whi h does not\nontemplate the anisotropy of the rystalline environment. Within these al ulations\nthe 4f state is treated as a ore state. Then, they al ulate the hybridization ontribution to \u2206CF for CeX (X=P, As, Sb and Bi) on the basis of the Anderson Hamiltonian\nusing se ond order pertubation theory. These hybridization ontributions have an opposite sign to that of the PC model. In this way, they an explain the suppresion of the\nrystal-\u001celd splitting of the heavier Ce monopni tides observed from the experimental\ndata.\nIn the present work, we al ulate \u2206CF for this series of monopni tides in a different way. We perform ab\n\ninitio\n\nal ulations using the Full Potential-LAPW method\n\nwithin the lo al density approximation (LDA) [2\u2104 instead of the ASA potential and\nwe treat the 4f states as part of the valen e band. We then al ulate the proje ted\n4f -densities of states, \u03c1mm\u2032 , for the systems at the experimental volumes (where m\n\nruns for the seven irredu ible representations for a ubi environment) and ompute\nthe hybridization fun tion, \u0393mm\u2032 (\u01eb), following ref. [3, 4\u2104.\nThe di\u001berent \u0393mm\u2032 (\u01eb) ontain detailed information of the ele troni stru ture of\nea h system and are used as input for the Anderson Impurity model whi h is solved\nwithin an extended non- rossing approximation (NCA). In the Anderson model the\nvalue of the\n\nbare\n\nf energy level, \u03b5f , is taken as the experimental value that omes\n\nout of photoemission spe tra [5\u2104. This LDA-NCA approa h has already been applied\nto ubi and tetragonal Ce based systems to al ulate \u2206CF 's and the trend in the\n\n3\n\n\fKondo energy s ales yelding results in good agreement with the available experimental\ninformation [4, 6\u2104.\nWithin this te hnique \u2206CF 's arise from band-f hybridization and the anisotropy\nof the rystalline environment.\nExperimental data of the CF splittings for the ompounds under study in the\npresent work are the following: 8 K for CeBi, 37 K for CeSb, 159 K for CeAs and\n172 K for CeP . All the ompounds have been reported to have the \u03937 multiplet as the\nground state [7\u2104. There is no available data for CeN .\nFigure 1 and 2 show the al ulated hybridization fun tion for CeP and CeSb. In\nthe inset, the detailed stru ture of these fun tions around the Fermi energy is shown\nand the \u03937 and \u03938 average values are expli itly shown. It an be observed that while\nthe uno upied states are governed by the \u03938 symmetry, lose to the Fermi level the\n\u03937 one is stronger. As it is dis ussed in another ontribution to this onferen e [8\u2104, the\n\n5d-Ce band hybridizes mainly with the \u03937 4f states while the p-X band with the \u03938 4f\nstates.\nWhithin this model, a stronger \u03938 hybridization would imply a \u03938 symmetry for the\nground state. If we onsider the CF splittings that result from the LDA al ulations\ntaking into a ount the whole energy range for the ondu tion band (up to 1 Ry approx.), we obtain that the ground state is \u03938 for all the CeX series and a de reasing\n\u2206CF from N to Bi, the value of the splittings being mu h larger than the experimental\n\ndata. The reason why these results disagree both in sign and magnitud of \u2206CF is that\nthe al ulated hybridization fun tion for the p-X band (\u03938 ) is overestimated due to the\n\n4\n\n\ffa t that the LDA al ulation does not a ount for the strong ioni\n\nhara ter of these\n\nmonopni tides ompounds. Wills and Cooper also obtain a strong hybridization for\nthe p-X band whi h is ompensated by taking into a ount the CF shift from the ioni\npoint harge model. In the present work we are able to reprodu e the orre t trend of\n\u2206CF 's if we onsider the energy spe trum of the bands up to an energy of the order\n\nof 6000 K above the Fermi level, dis arding the uno upied states above that energy.\nWith this riterion, we obtain a \u03937 ground state for all the series and the al ulated\nvalues for the CF splittings are: 160K for CeP, 150K for CeAs, 70K for CeSb and 50 K\nfor CeBi. For CeN we also obtain a \u03937 ground state and a splitting greater that room\ntemperture.\nAs it is dis ussed in Ref. [8\u2104 the more important ontribution to the \u2206CF 's in this\nseries of ompounds omes from the energy dependent hybridization fun tion around\nthe Fermi level (EF ). Within this energy range, \u03937 hybridization is stronger and the\ndi\u001beren e between the \u03937 and \u03938 hybridization strength varies along the series be ause\nwithin the Full Potential-LDA al ulation we take the 4f states as part of the valen e\nband giving rise to di\u001berent CF splittings. We laim that the main ontribution to the\nhybridization around EF omes from the 5d-4f intera tion. In the systems where the 4f\nstates are more lo alized (CeBi, CeSb) the 5d-4f hybridization is smaller and in turn,\na smaller CF splitting is obtained. We onsider that the p-4f hybridization should not\nbe that strong for these ioni\n\nompounds.\n\nIn previous al ulations [4, 6\u2104, it was not ne essary to ut the energy spe trum\nbe ause those ompounds (the ubi CeM3 and the tetragonal CeM2 Si2 ) do not present\n\n5\n\n\fsu h a strong ioni\n\nhara ter and LDA an give an appropiate des ription of the on-\n\ndu tion bands.\nThis work was partially funded by UBACyT-X115, PICT-0310698 and PIP 20052006 Num. 6016.
