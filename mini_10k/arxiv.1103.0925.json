Many experimental and theoretical studies in this area focus on the field-induced dynamics\nof a isolated nanoparticle such as a magnetic rod, 1\u20133 a magnetic chain 4 or filament, 5 or an optically excitable nanorod 6 in\na viscous medium. Understanding the resulting single-particle\nrotational dynamics is particularly important for actuators, 2\nmolecular switches, particles in optical traps, 6 and in the more\ngeneral context of microfluidics. 3 From the theoretical side,\nthese problems are often successfully analyzed on the basis of\nsingle-particle, nonlinear equations for the driven rotational\nmotion in the presence of solvent-induced friction. 1\u20133,6 Typically, the particle dynamics exhibits a \"linear\" regime at low\ndriving frequencies, where the particle axis follows the field,\nand various types of nonlinear behavior at high frequencies,\nsuch as rotation against the torque. 6 Many of these nonlinear\nphenomena, including transient behavior such as conformal\ntransitions 4 of magnetic chains following a sudden switch-on\nof the driving field, can also be observed experimentally. 1,3\nApart from the single-particle dynamics, another current\nfocus concerns the self-assembly behavior in colloidal manyparticle systems that are exposed to rotating fields. Indeed, in\nmaterial science, time-dependent fields are currently realized\nas a powerful tool to control self-assembly processes, which\na\n\nInstitute of Theoretical Physics, Technical University Berlin, Hardenbergstr.\n36, 10623 Berlin, Germany. E-mail: klapp@physik.tu-berlin.de\n\nare an important prerequisite for synthesizing functional materials. 7,8 A classical example in this context, first discussed by\nMartin et al., 9 are systems of paramagnetic (or polarizable)\nspherical particles in magnetic (electric) fields rotating in a\nplane. For sufficient field strength, both experiment and computer simulations 9\u201311 reveal the formation of layers in the field\nplane, i.e. a spatial symmetry breaking induced by the rotating\nfield. Indeed, a rotating in-plane field generates, on averaging\nover time, an inverted dipolar pair interaction with in-plane attraction and repulsion along the rotation axis. 11,12 Therefore,\nthe structures induced by planar rotating fields are markedly\ndifferent from those observed in a consant and homogeneous\nfield, which supports the formation of field-aligned chains\n(low densities) 13\u201315 and bulk crystals. 16,17\nThe general idea to use time-dependent fields to tune\npair interactions and thereby control the morphology of selfassembled structures has meanwhile become more and more\npopular (see Refs. 18,19), a recent example being the formation of self-healing membranes of superparamagnetic particles\nin tilted rotating fields. 20 Interestingly, these self-assembly\nphenomena can often be explained from an equilibrium perspective involving the free energy and resulting phase behavior of a many-particle system in a time-averaged field. Clearly,\nthe crucial assumption in adopting this perspective, which is\nalso often exploited in computer simulation studies (see e.g.\nRefs. 9,21) is that the particles follow the field synchronously.\nIn the present paper we explore, for a magnetic manyparticle system, the link between the collective, self-assembly\nbehavior, on the one hand, and the single-particle dynam1\u201311 | 1\n\n\fics, on the other hand. Specifically, we consider a ferrofluid\nsubjected to a rotating in-plane field, where the ferrofluid\nis modeled by a system of dipolar soft spheres (DSS). The\nsame model has been considered earlier in a computer simulation study by Murashov and Patey, 22 where the aim was\nto demonstrate that layering occurs not only in systems of\n(super-)paramagnetic or polarizable particles (as those considered by Martin et al. 9,10 ), but also for particles with permanent dipoles. Here we investigate the driven DSS system both\nby Brownian dynamics (BD) computer simulations, which are\ndescribed in Sec. 2, and by theory. As a first main result, we\npresent in Sec. 3.2 a full non-equilibrium \"phase\" diagram indicating the domain of layer formation in the plane spanned\nby the frequency and strength of the driving field at constant\nequilibrium thermodynamic parameters. Secondly, to identify the role of mutual synchronization of the particles, we investigate in Sec. 3.3 the rotational dynamics within layered\nand unlayered states by analyzing suitable distribution functions. A similar strategy has recently been proposed in a dynamic density functional study of rod-like particles in rotating\nfields. 23 In Sec. 3.3.1 we show that the breakdown of layering\nobserved at high frequencies in the ferrofluid system can be\ndescribed by a single-particle theory similar to those used for\nfield-driven single nanoparticles in viscous media. 6 Finally, in\nSec. 3.4, we propose a simple equilibrium density functional\napproach to investigate the role of translational entropy for\nlayering in synchronized ferrofluid systems. The results are\nin good agreement with corresponding BD simulations. We\nclose the paper with a brief summary and conclusions (Sec. 4).\n\n2 Model and simulation methods\nIn our simulations we model the colloidal suspension by a system of dipolar soft spheres (DSS). The solvent is not explicitly taken into account. The DSS pair potential between two\nspheres is comprised of a repulsive potential U rep and a point\ndipole-dipole interaction potential\nU DSS (rij , \u03bci , \u03bcj ) =\nU rep (rij ) \u2212\n\n3(rij * \u03bci )(rij * \u03bcj ) \u03bci * \u03bcj\n+\n. (1)\n5\n3\nrij\nrij\n\nIn eqn (1), rij is the vector between the positions of the particles i and j, rij its absolute value, and \u03bci is the dipole moment\nof the ith particle. The potential U rep is the shifted soft sphere\npotential, which is given by\nU rep (r) = U SS (r) \u2212 U SS (rc ) + (rc \u2212 r)\nwhere\nU\n\n2|\n\nSS\n\n(r) = 4\u01eb\n\n1\u201311\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\nrij\n\n\u001312\n\ndU SS\n(rc ),\ndr\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nis the unshifted soft sphere (SS) potential for particles of radius \u03c3. Further, rc = 2.5\u03c3 is the radius at which we cut off\nthe potential U rep .\nWe investigate the system using non-overdamped Brownian\ndynamics (BD) simulations (sometimes called Langevin dynamics simulations). The corresponding equations of motion\nfor particles of mass m and moment of inertia I are 22\nmr\u0308i = FDSS\n\u2212 \u03beT \u1e59i + FG\ni\ni\nI \u03c9\u0307i =\n\nTDSS\u22a5\ni\n\n+\n\nText\u22a5\ni\n\n\u2212 \u03beR \u03c9 i +\n\n(4)\nTG\u22a5\ni .\n\n(5)\n\nIn these equations \u03beT = kB T /D and \u03beR = kB T /Dr are\nfriction coefficients with kB and T being Boltzmann's constant and temperature, respectively, while D and Dr are the\ntranslational and rotational diffusion constants. Furthermore\nG\n\u03c9 i is the angular velocity of particle i, FG\ni and Ti are ranext\ndom Gaussian forces and torques, Ti are torques due to an\n2\nexternal field, and T\u22a5\ni = Ti \u2212(\u03bci *Ti )\u03bci /\u03bci .

This ensures that\nthe system approaches a canonical distribution of states characterized by a constant temperature T in the absence of an\nexternal drive. To deal with the long-ranged dipolar interactions, we used the Ewald summation method with conducting boundaries. 24 We have parallelized the evaluation of the\nEwald sum in our simulation with OpenMP and MPI. The\nequations of motion were integrated with a Leapfrog algorithm. 25\nThe external field that the particles interact with rotates with\nfrequency \u03c90 in the x \u2212 y-plane and is given by\nB(t) = B0 (ex cos \u03c90 t + ey sin \u03c90 t).\n\n(10)\n\nFor convenience, we make use of the following reduced\nunits: Field strength B0\u2217 = (\u03c3 3 /\u01eb)1/2 B0 ; angular frequency\n\u03c90\u2217 = (m\u03c3 2 /\u01eb)1/2 \u03c90 ; density \u03c1\u2217 = \u03c3 3 \u03c1; dipole moment\n\u03bc\u2217 = (\u01eb\u03c3 3 )\u22121/2 \u03bc; and moment of inertia I \u2217 = (m\u03c3 2 )\u22121 I.\nUnless stated otherwise, the simulations were carried out with\n864 particles at density \u03c1\u2217 = 0.1, dipole moment \u03bc\u2217 = 3, moment of inertia I \u2217 = 0.025, and temperature T \u2217 = kB T /\u01eb =\n1.35. To verify our results, we also ran simulations with\n\n\fup to 4000 particles. The translational and rotational diffusion constant were chosen to be D = 0.1 * (\u01eb\u03c3 2 /m)1/2 and\nDr = 3 * (m\u03c3 2 /\u01eb)\u22121/2 , respectively, and we used a timestep\nof \u2206t = 0.0025 * (m\u03c3 2 /\u01eb)1/2 . These values are consistent\nwith those chosen in earlier BD studies of rotating dipolar\nsystems. 22 We note, however, that the effects reported in the\npresent paper also appear for other values of D and Dr .\n\nThis phenomenon was first explained by Halsey, Anderson,\nand Martin. 12 They realized that the time-averaged potential\nbetween two particles i and j that rotate with the same angular\nfrequency (given by the external field) and are aligned with\neach other, i.e. rotate circularly in a synchronized fashion with\n\u03bci (t) = \u03bcj (t) = \u03bc(ex cos \u03c90 t + ey sin \u03c90 t),\n\n(11)\n\nis given by\n\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Zero field system\nThe zero field system, which represents our starting point,\nis characterized by a large dipolar coupling strength \u03bb =\n\u03bc2 /(kB T \u03c3 3 ) \u2248 6.7 and a relatively low density. As expected\nfor such a strongly coupled system, the particles self-assemble\ninto chainlike structures. 15,26 This can be seen in the snapshot depicted in Fig. 1a. Our reason for considering a system of a coupling strength this high is that this seems to be\na prerequisite for layer formation. Indeed, irrespective of the\nfield strength, we did not observe any layering for values of\n\u03bb that are smaller than approximately 4.6 (at the temperature\nT \u2217 = 1.35).\nContrary to \u03bb, our choice of the density is less restricted,\nsince the layering phenomenon persists over a wide range of\ndensities (at least up to \u03c1\u2217 = 0.4). However, choosing the\nsmall density of \u03c1\u2217 = 0.1 has the advantage that layers are\neasily discernible.\n\nU ID (rij ) = \u03c4 \u22121\n\nZ\n\nt0 +\u03c4\n\nt0\n\n= \u2212\u03bc2\n\n3.2 The layering effect\nWe now consider the same system in rotating fields of various\nstrengths B0\u2217 and frequencies \u03c90\u2217 . For sufficiently large B0\u2217\nand not too high frequencies (see below), the particles arrange\nthemselves into layers. An example of this is shown in Fig. 1b.\n\n(1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u0398ij )\n. (12)\n3\n2rij\n\nIn this equation, U D is the dipole-dipole potential (see eqn\n(1), \u03c4 = 2\u03c0/\u03c90 is the oscillation period, and \u0398ij is the angle\nbetween the interparticle vector rij and the direction perpendicular to the plane of the field. As shown by the last line\nin eqn (12), the time-averaged potential corresponds to an inverted dipolar (ID) potential, which is attractive if the angle\n\u0398ij satisfies cos2 \u0398ij < 1/3, i.e. if the particles i and j are\napproximately in the same plane with respect to the field. Conversely, if the angle \u0398ij satisfies 1/3 < cos2 \u0398ij , the particles\nrepel each other. This direction dependence of the ID potential\nexplains why layers are a favorable configuration for a driven\nsystem in which the particles rotate synchronously.\nNote that for the above argument to hold, the translational\nmotion of the particles should be small compared to their rotational motion. More precisely, during one rotational period\nthey should migrate much less than their own diameter. 12\nIn the following we aim to determine more precisely the\nrange of frequencies and field strengths at which layering occurs. To do that, we need a suitably defined order parameter.\nWe tested several ones and compared them with one another.\nThe order parameter that we will use here is given by\n\u03c8=\n\nFig. 1 (a) Snapshot of the system in zero field at \u03c1\u2217 = 0.1,\nT \u2217 = 1.35, and \u03bc\u2217 = 3. (b) Snapshot of a system in a layered state.\nThe strength and frequency of the field are B0\u2217 = 12 and \u03c90\u2217 = 15,\nrespectively.\n\nU D (rij , \u03bci (t), \u03bcj (t))dt\n\nN\n1 X\nhni i,\nN i=1\n\n(13)\n\nwhere N is the total number of particles, h* * * i denotes a timeaverage, and ni is defined as follows: Consider a sphere of\nradius r0 around particle i. Divide that sphere into two parts,\none of which is given by the points within the sphere whose\ndistance vector to particle i together with the z-axis encloses\nan angle \u0398 satisfying \u22120.5 < cos \u0398 < 0.5 (see Fig. 2). If\nthere are more (less) particles in this equatorial volume than\nin the polar volume around particle i, set ni = 1 (\u22121); if there\nare the same number of particles, set ni = 0. Note that the\nradius r0 was set to 8\u03c3. Smaller as well as larger radii r0 decrease the performance of the order parameter as we found by\ncomparing the order parameter with the actual order observed\nin the system.\n1\u201311 | 3\n\n\fr0\n\n12\n\u0398\n\nFig. 2 Sketch of the polar and equatorial regions used in the\ndefinition of the order parameter.\n\nB0\u2217\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\nRepresentative examples for the behavior of the resulting\norder parameter at constant angular frequency but increasing\nfield strength are given in Fig. 3. As can be seen, in all\nthe cases the value of \u03c8 grows with the field strength until\nit almost reaches a value of 1. Since the layers are usually\nnot perfectly defined in our Brownian dynamics simulations,\nthe order parameter typically takes on values that are slightly\nsmaller than 1 even at very high field strengths.\nOne also finds from Fig. 3 that there is a qualitative difference in the behavior of \u03c8 at high and low frequencies: The\norder parameter grows much more steeply at large frequencies, which means that the layers do not slowly emerge upon\nincreasing the field strength but appear very rapidly.\n\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n1.00\n0.75\n\n\u0002\n\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nB0\u0001\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nB0\u0003\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 3 The order parameter \u03c8 at constant angular frequency (a)\n\u03c90\u2217 = 1, (b) 20, (c) 30, (d) 40.\n\nBy inspecting snapshots corresponding to a given value of\nthe order parameter, it turned out that the value \u03c80 \u2248 0.6 may\nserve as an (approximate) lower limit for layer formation.\nBased on that criterion, we have scanned a broad range of\nfrequencies and field strengths for the occurrence of layers.\nThe results of this exploration of the parameter space are summarized in Fig. 4.

The system parameters are chosen as\ndescribed in Sec. 2.\n\nlayer is disordered and becomes more and more homogeneous\nwith larger \u03c90\u2217 . In particular there is no pronounced hexagonal\norder as observed in earlier studies, 9 even though the particles\ntend to have six nearest neighbors at high \u03c90 . This absence of\npronounced in-plane order is probably a consequence of the\nlow density considered (\u03c1\u2217 = 0.1) and the Brownian random\nforces. Furthermore, depending on the initial conditions, we\ntypically observe two or three layers in our simulation box\n(N = 864), which corresponds to an average vertical distance\nbetween the layers of about seven to ten particle diameters.\nThe figure shows that the \u03c90\u2217 \u2212 B0\u2217 diagram is separated into\na layered and a non-layered region. Upon increasing the frequency from zero, the boundary first remains at roughly constant field strength, until it begins to rise with the frequency.\nThis behavior is mirrored in Fig. 3. The larger the frequency,\nthe higher the field strength at which the order parameter attains large values.\nA similar picture emerges from Fig. 5, where we have\nplotted the normalized absolute value of thePmagnetization,\nN\ni.e. M/M0 = h|M(t)|i/M0 with M(t) =\ni=1 \u03bci (t) and\n\u2217\nM0 = N \u03bc, as a function of B0 for several frequencies. Note\nthat |M(t)| is essentially independent of time for the states\nconsidered in Fig. 5. Clearly, the magnetization behaves differently in the regimes of small and large frequencies. One\nalso finds from Fig. 5 that a degree of magnetization of more\nthan 80 percent is required for layer formation to occur.\nIn the following subsections, we will discuss the emergence\nand breakdown of layering in the different frequency regimes\nin more detail. Before doing so, it is worth to briefly comment\non a technical issue encountered in our exploration of the parameter space (see Fig. 4) that concerns thePbehavior of the\nN\nrotational temperature Trot = 1/(2(N \u2212 1)) i=1 I\u03c9i2 .

Fig. 4). Results for the distribution f at\nthree such frequencies \u03c90\u2217 are given in Fig. 6. For each value\nof \u03c90\u2217 one observes a single, pronounced peak, reflecting a\nsynchronized \"state\", in which the particles follow the field at\nconstant phase difference. Note that the larger \u03c90\u2217 , the larger\n\n2.0\n\n\u03c90\u2217 = 15\n\nB0\u2217 ),\n\nincreasing the driving frequency\nfrom zero (at fixed\nwe typically also find Trot to increase,\nPNwhile its translational\ncounterpart Ttrans = 1/(3(N \u2212 1)) i=1 mvi2 stays approximately constant (close to the input value T ). Similar temperature drifts have been observed in other non-equilibrium\nsystems such as fluids in shear flow. In the latter context,\nthe temperature is often redefined with respect to the differences between the actual velocity of the particle and that of\nthe flow field. 27 Using a similar definition here (involving the\ndifference between \u03c9i and \u03c90 ), we find that this temperature\nis still not equal to T , but remains essentially constant over a\nbroad range of frequencies. We also note that both the temperature drift and the actual location of the layer boundary in the\n\u03c90\u2217 \u2212 B0\u2217 diagram depend on the chosen value of the rotational\nfriction constant.\n\n3.3 Rotational dynamics in the layered state\nAs mentioned earlier, the key argument for the appearance of\nthe layers is that the time-averaged interaction between two\nfully synchronized rotating dipoles favors an in-plane configuration. In the following, we will investigate in more detail to\nwhat extent this assumption is actually fulfilled within the layered region indicated in Fig. 4. To this end, we consider the\ndistribution f of the phase differences \u03c6i between the dipolar\nvector of particle i in the x \u2212 y-plane and the external field.\n\n\u03c90\u2217 = 32\n\n1.5\n\nf(\u03c6)\n\n\u03c90\u2217\n\n\u03c90\u2217 = 54\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\nFig. 6 Distribution of the phase differences at B0\u2217 = 10 and three\nfrequencies \u03c90\u2217 with \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/48. The systems are in layered states\n(see Fig. 4).\n\nthe phase difference between the particles and the field. This\nis not too surprising since an increase in the driving frequency\nimplies an increase in the rotational friction due to the (implicit) solvent and the presence of neighboring particles. Further note that even though eqn (14) contains a time-average,\nthe phase distributions of these layered systems are essentially\nindependent of time.\nTo investigate the degree to which the particles actually rotate in the plane of the field, we also consider the distribution\nof the z-components of the angular frequencies\n+\n* N\nX\n1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u0398(\u03c9i,z \u2212n\u2206\u03c9)\u2212\u0398(\u03c9i,z \u2212(n+1)\u2206\u03c9) .\ng(\u03c9z ) =\nN \u2206\u03c9 i=1\n1\u201311 | 5\n\n\fg(\u03c9z\u2217 ) [10\u22122 ]\n\n5\n4\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c90\u2217 = 15\n\u03c90\u2217 = 32\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c90\u2217 = 54\n\nf (\u03c6)\n\n6\n\n3\n2\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n1\n0 \u221240 \u221220 0\n\n20\n\u2217\n\n\u03c9z\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0.0\n-\u03c0/2\n\n6|\n\n1\u201311\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n3/2\u03c0\n\n\u03c6\n\ng(\u03c9z\u2217) [10\u2212 2 ]\n\nFig. 7 Distributions of the z-component of the angular frequencies.\nParameters are as in Fig. 6. The interval \u2206\u03c9 is set to 1.\n\nIn an ideal situation, in which the dipoles rotate perfectly\nwith the field, the distribution g would have a single, sharp\npeak at \u03c9z\u2217 = \u03c90\u2217 . Simulation results for g in the true manyparticle system are shown in Fig. 7, where we have picked\nout the \"states\" already considered in Fig. 6. As expected in\nthe layered regime, the functions g are characterized by one\ncentral peak around \u03c9z\u2217 \u2248 \u03c90\u2217 . However, we also see that there\nis a significant broadness in the distribution (as there is in the\ncorresponding peaks of f ).\nFinally, above a certain frequency, the layers disappear.\nThis is reflected in the emergence of a double-peaked structure in the distribution of the phase differences, as illustrated\nin Fig. 8a. Moreover, we found that the non-averaged distribution of the phase differences is not independent of the time\nanymore. However, since we could not identify any systematic time-dependence in this regime, we restrict ourselves to\nconsidering the averaged distribution. The first peak in f at\n\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0/4 is due to particles that can still temporarily follow\nthe field, whereas particles that are not able to do so anymore\ncause the structure of the rest of the distribution. The breakdown of layering is also visible in the distribution g. Contrary\nto what is seen in a layered system, the angular frequencies of\nthe majority of the particles are distributed around \u03c9z\u2217 \u2248 0 as\nshown in Fig. 8b. The much smaller peak at approximately the\nfrequency of the external drive shows that only a small fraction of the particles follow the field at any given time. This\nfraction is further decreased as the frequency \u03c90\u2217 of the driving field increases. Typical distributions f and g at values of\n\u03c90\u2217 outside the layered regime are shown in Figs. 9a and 9b,\nrespectively. Note that the roughly symmetric distribution of\n\u03c9z\u2217 around approximately zero in Fig. 9b indicates that the\nparticles are as likely to rotate in the direction of the field as\nthey are to rotate in the opposite direction.\n\n0\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n\u2212 40 \u2212 20 0\n\n20 40 60 80\n\n\u03c9z\u2217\n\nFig. 8 (a) Distribution of the phase differences of the system at\nB0\u2217 = 10 and \u03c90\u2217 = 55.8, i.e. just outside of the region of layer\nformation.

To understand the\ncharacter of the high-frequency boundary between layered and\nnon-layered states in more detail, we now aim to construct an\neffective theory that describes a single dipolar particle rotating in a viscous medium. A similar consideration has been\nsuggested for optically torqued nanorods by Shelton et al.. 6\nClearly, such a single-particle approach cannot grant us direct\ninsight into the formation of layers. However, it may help us to\nimprove our understanding of the rotational dynamics isolated\nfrom many-particle effects. For simplicity, we assume that the\nrotational motion of the particle is restricted to the plane of\nthe field and that it experiences rotational friction with fric-\n\n\fFor 0 \u2264 \u03c90 < \u03c9c it has two fixed points characterized by\n\u03c6\u0307 = 0 (i.e. constant phase difference): One solution is a\nglobal attractor with \u03c6 = arcsin(\u03c90 /\u03c9c ), and the other one\nis unstable with \u03c6 = \u03c0 \u2212 arcsin(\u03c90 /\u03c9c ). These two solutions\ncorrespond to the phase differences at which the torque due to\nfriction equals the torque that is due to the field. At \u03c90 = \u03c9c ,\ni.e. at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, the two solutions form a saddle-node bifurcation and there are no fixed points for \u03c90 > \u03c9c . At these\nhigh frequencies, the maximal torque that can be exerted by\nthe field is insufficient to balance the frictional torque. The\nsolution emerging after the bifurcation is a limit cycle with\n\u03c6\u0307 > 0.\n\n0.3\n\nf (\u03c6)\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n3/2\u03c0\n\n12\n10\n\n2.0\n\n8\n\nB 0\u2217\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n6\n\n1.0\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n2\n0\n\n0.0\n\n\u2212 40 \u2212 20 0\n\nLayers\nNo layers\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n12\n\nFig. 9 (a) Distribution of phase differences of the system at\nB0\u2217 = 10 and \u03c90\u2217 = 60.

The solid line indicates the\nfrequencies \u03c9c\u2217 .\n\nTo which extent does the single-particle approach describe\nthe true many-particle system of our BD simulations? In Fig.\n10a, the frequencies \u03c9c (with \u03b3 \u2261 \u03beR , see eqn (5)) are plotted\n1\u201311 | 7\n\n\finto the \u03c90\u2217 \u2212 B0\u2217 -state diagram (Fig. 4). At large frequencies\n\u03c90\u2217 and field strengths B0\u2217 , the straight line representing \u03c9c has\na slope similar to that of the boundary of the layered regime.\nThis supports the idea that it is the (rotational) friction which\neventually yields a breakdown of the synchronous rotations,\nand thus, the layering. A further observation from Fig. 10a is\nthat the true boundary frequencies (at given B0\u2217 ) are somewhat\nsmaller than \u03c9c . One seemingly obvious reason for these deviations is that the effective theory neglects any many-particle\neffects. Moreover, it does not take the Brownian random contributions into account that mimic the solvent \"kicks\" in eqn\n(5). Both these factors could introduce perturbations of the effective field that acts on a particle. Thereby the synchronized\nstate could be destabilized already at frequencies \u03c9 < \u03c9c .\nHowever, as it turns out, the more significant reason for the\npremature stop of layering is that the BD equations of motion\ninvolve (rotational) inertial terms, which are neglected in our\nsingle-particle approach.\nTo check this point, we have performed additional BD simulations with a lower moment of inertia (I \u2217 = 0.01). The\nresulting frequencies characterizing the boundary of the layered state are shown in Fig. 10b along with the original result\n(I \u2217 = 0.025) and the line \u03c9c . Clearly, decreasing the moment\nof inertia moves the true boundary substantially closer to the\nsingle-particle result.\nFinally, we note that the influence of the inertial (rotational)\nterm can also be captured within our effective single particle\ntheory. For I 6= 0, eqn (16) can be written as\nd\u03c6\n\u03c90\nd2 \u03c6\n+\u03bd \u2032 =\n\u2212 sin \u03c6\n(18)\n\u20322\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\u03c9c\np\n\u221a\nwith \u03bd = \u03b3/ \u03bcB0 I and \u03c4 \u2032 = \u03bcB0 /It. Similar to (16), this\ndifferential equation has a bifurcation at \u03c9c , 28 which means\nthat the location of the line \u03c9c in Fig. 10a remains unchanged. 28 As before, the only stable solution at driving frequencies that are larger than \u03c9c is a limit cycle. But additionally, for sufficiently small \u03bd, it has a second bifurcation for\nsome \u03c9 \u2032 with \u03c9 \u2032 < \u03c9c as shown by Argentina et al. while\ninvestigating the transition between annihilation and preservation of colliding waves. 29 This second bifurcation introduces\na regime in which the limit cycle can coexist with the stable\nrotation. From the perspective of a many-particle system, one\nmay speculate that the presence of the second solution perturbs the rotation with constant phase difference (i.e., \u03c6\u0307 = 0).\n3.4 A density functional approach to layering in a perfectly synchronized system\nWe now consider systems at relatively low driving frequencies (\u03c90\u2217 . 30), where, for sufficiently large field strengths\nB0\u2217 , the dipole vectors can follow the field in a perfectly synchronized fashion (see the discussion in the preceding sec8|\n\n1\u201311\n\ntion). According to our \"phase\" diagram in Fig. 4, the field\nstrength required to induce such synchronous and, at the same\ntime, layered states, is about B0\u2217 \u2248 4 \u2212 6 for \u03c90\u2217 . 30. The\ncorresponding dipole-field coupling parameter \u03bcB0 /kB T =\n\u03bc\u2217 B0\u2217 /T \u2217 \u2248 12 is significantly larger than the dipole-dipole\ncoupling parameter (\u03bb \u2248 6.7). Nevertheless, as seen in Figs.\n3a and b as well as Fig. 5, increasing B0\u2217 from zero at low\ndriving frequencies yields a rather slow increase of the order\nparameter \u03c8 and the magnetization amplitude.\nGiven the apparent interconnectedness between the rotational dynamics of the individual dipoles and the layering of\nthe particles, we ask in the present section whether synchronization leads automatically to layering. Indeed, even in a\nperfectly rotating system, one would expect that the spatial\nsymmetry-breaking associated with layering yields a decrease\nof translational entropy and thus may be unfavorable.\nTo investigate this question we employ equilibrium density\nfunctional theory (DFT) for a system in which the dipole rotations are perfectly synchronized. Under such conditions the\nparticles effectively interact via the time-averaged (inverted)\ndipolar potential given in eqn (12). By using this potential, the\nproblem thus reduces to searching for an equilibrium phase\ntransition in a system with effectively static interactions.\nOur density functional approach is based on the perturbation expansion of the free energy originally proposed by Ramakrishnan and Yussouff in the context of fluid-solid transitions. 30 Up to second order in the density, the difference between the Helmholtz free energy of a volume V of a system\nwith non-uniform density \u03c1(r) and a reference system with\nhomogeneous density \u03c10 is given by 31\nZ\n1\n\u2206F\n=\nd3 r[log(\u039b3 \u03c1(r)) \u2212 1]\nV\n\u03b2V V\nZ\n1\n\u2212\nd3 r\u03c10 [log(\u03bb3 \u03c10 ) \u2212 1]\n\u03b2V V\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u2212\nd3 r1 d3 r2 c(r1 \u2212 r2 )|\u03c10 \u2206\u03c1(r1 )\u2206\u03c1(r2 ). (19)\n2\u03b2V V\n3\nR\nIn eqn (19), \u2206\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(r) \u2212 \u03c10 with V d3 r\u2206\u03c1(r) = 0, \u039b\nis the thermal wavelength, and c(r)|\u03c10 is the direct correlation\nfunction of the homogeneous system.\nHere we employ the random phase approximation (RPA) to\ncalculate the direct correlation function. 32 Assuming a hard\nsphere interaction in addition to the inverse dipolar potential\nU ID (eqn (12)), the RPA amounts to setting\n(\ncPY (r),\nr\u2264\u03c3\nc(r) =\n(20)\nID\n\u2212\u03b2U (r), r > \u03c3,\nwhere we used the Percus-Yevick direct correlation function,\ncPY , 32 for the hard-sphere part. Note that within the RPA, the\neffects of the contributions of the long-ranged inverse dipolar interaction are treated in a mean-field fashion. To check\n\n\f\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(z) = \u03c10 + \u03c1\u0303 cos(kz).\nInserting this ansatz into eqn (19), we find\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u03c1\u03032\n1 \u03bbL\n\u03c1(z)\n\u2206F\n\u2212 \u03bbL c\u0303(k),\ndz\u03c1(z) log\n=\nA\n\u03b2 0\n\u03c10\n4\u03b2\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\n1.0\n\n\u2206 F \u03c33 / (A\u03bbL \u03b5)[10\u22122 ]\n\nthis point, we have also calculated c(r) numerically by solving the mean-spherical (MSA) integral equations. 32 However,\nthe changes in the free energies were found to be marginal.\nAs a simple ansatz for the density profile in the layered\nstate, we use\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bc \u2217 = 2.5\n\u03bc \u2217 = 2.6\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n\u03c1\u0303\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n\n\u03bc\u2217\n\nwhere jn are spherical Bessel functions of order n. (For the\ntreatment of the dipolar interactions in eqn (23), see Ref. 33)\nWe now use eqn (22) to search for a phase transition between the homogeneous and the layered state. In principle,\nthis search requires a minimization of \u2206F /A with respect\nto both the parameters \u03c1\u0303 and k that characterize the inhomogeneity of the system (see eqn (21)). It turns out, however,\nthat \u2206F /A becomes minimal with respect to k for k \u2192 0,\nwhich corresponds to an infinite distance between the layers.\nClearly, this is not compatible with the implicit assumption\nof a finite wavelength. Therefore we have fixed the parameter k = 2\u03c0/\u03bbL to physically reasonable values, i.e. to values suggested by our BD simulations. At \u03c1\u22170 = 0.1, we find\nan average layer distance of approximately 7.2\u03c3 (see below).\nThis leaves the coefficient \u03c1\u0303 as the only minimization parameter. Results for the function \u2206F (\u03c1\u0303)/(A\u03bbL ) with fixed distance \u03bbL = 7.2\u03c3 between the layers at various values of the\nparameter \u03bc\u2217 are plotted in Fig. 11a.\nThe different curves in Fig. 11a reveal a behavior typical\nof a second-order phase transition. For \u03bc\u2217 . 2.27, the free\nenergy has only one minimum at \u03c1\u0303 = 0 corresponding to an\nhomogeneous state. This changes at \u03bc\u2217c \u2248 2.27: For larger\nvalues of \u03bc\u2217 , the solution at \u03c1\u0303 = 0 represents a maximum,\nand the only minimum occurs for \u03c1\u0303 > 0. The corresponding\nnegative values of \u2206F /A indicate that it is indeed the layered\nstate which is now globally stable.\nWe have repeated the DFT calculations for a number of densities in the range 0.01 \u2264 \u03c1\u22170 \u2264 0.4. To find reasonable values\nfor the corresponding wavelengths \u03bbL in the layered state, we\nran BD simulations at fixed dipole moment \u03bc\u2217 = 3.4, frequency \u03c90\u2217 = 8, and field strength B0\u2217 = 50. With this choice\nof the parameters, the particles are almost perfectly aligned,\njustifying the key assumption of our DFT approach. Fitting\n\n\u03bc \u2217 = 2.4\n\n-1.0\n0.00\n\nwhere \u2206F is the free energy of the volume A * \u03bbL , A is an\narea in the x \u2212 y-direction and \u03bbL = 2\u03c0/k. Further, c\u0303 is the\nFourier transform of c and c\u0303(k) \u2261 c\u0303(kez ). In the RPA, we\nhave\n\u0012Z \u03c3\n\u0013\n2\nPY\n2 j1 (k\u03c3)\nc\u0303(k) = 4\u03c0\ndrr j0 (kr)c (r) + \u03bc \u03b2\n, (23)\nk\u03c3\n0\n\n\u03bc \u2217 = 2.25\n\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c10\u2217\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFig. 11 (a) Free energy difference between a layered and a\nhomogeneous state as a function of the coefficient \u03c1\u0303 (see eqn (21))\nat different values of the parameter \u03bc\u2217 . The case \u03c1\u0303 = 0 corresponds\nto the homogeneous solution. The overall density is set to \u03c1\u22170 = 0.1.\n(b) Equilibrium phase diagram of a perfectly synchronized system.\nThe gray area indicates the stability range of the layered state\naccording to our DFT calculations. Also shown are BD results (at\n\u03c90\u2217 = 8, B0\u2217 = 50) with the open circles (solid triangles)\nrepresenting layered (non-layered) states.\n\nthe resulting distances as functions of \u03c10 , we found the approximate relation d/\u03c3 \u2248 1.05\u03c1\u2217\u22120.84 , which was then used\nas an input in the DFT (i.e., \u03bbL = d).\nThe resulting phase diagram in the \u03c1\u22170 \u2212 \u03bc\u2217 -plane is plotted in Fig. 11b. It is seen that the DFT predicts a layering\ntransition for all but the smallest densities (\u03c1\u22170 & 0.01) in the\nshown parameter range, with the actual values of \u03bc\u2217c varying\nsubstantially with \u03c1\u22170 . Indeed, the lowest threshold is found\nat \u03c1\u22170 \u2248 0.2. Also shown in Fig. 11b are BD results for the\nappearance of layers in nearly perfectly synchronized systems\n(\u03c90\u2217 = 8, B0\u2217 = 50) at various values of \u03bc\u2217 . As in Sec. 3.2, the\npresence of layers was detected on the basis of the order pa1\u201311 | 9\n\n\frameter defined in eqn (13), yet with a slightly different definition of the cutoff radius entering the order parameter (r0 = d).\nComparing BD and DFT, it is seen that the DFT predicts the\ntrue phase boundary in perfectly synchronized systems in a\nqualitatively correct manner (including the strong increase of\n\u03bc\u2217c upon \u03c1\u22170 \u2192 0). Moreover, the DFT results are also quite\nreasonable from a quantitative point of view.\nFrom a physical perspective, clearly the most important\nconclusion is that even in a perfectly synchronized system,\na sufficient decrease of interaction energy stemming from the\ntime-averaged dipolar potential is required to overcome the\nentropy cost due to layering.\nFinally, we briefly discuss our DFT results in the light of\na recent Monte Carlo study by Smallenburg and Dijkstra, 21\nwho obtained full equilibrium phase diagrams of systems interacting with inverted dipolar interactions. To model the\nshort-range part of the interaction, Smallenburg and Dijkstra\nused either just hard spheres or hard spheres with an additional Yukawa repulsion. 21 In the first case, layer-like structures were only observed in the gas-liquid coexistence region.\nOn the contrary, the Yukawa system exhibits a stable layered\nphase with fluid-like in-plane structure. Comparing these latter results to our DFT predictions, we find that the predicted\nstrength of the inverted dipolar interactions required for layer\nformation is indeed comparable. On the other hand, we find\nthe onset of layer formation at much lower densities. Apart\nfrom the obvious approximations in our theory, we also attribute these deviations to the fact that the repulsive Yukawa\ninteraction used in Ref. 21 is much stronger than our soft\nsphere one.\n\n4 Conclusions\nIn this study we have combined BD computer simulations, an\neffective single-particle theory, and an (equilibrium) density\nfunctional approach to explore the dynamic behavior of systems of dipolar particles in planar rotating fields.\nOne main result from our BD simulations is a nonequilibrium \"phase\" diagram identifying the domain of layered states in the \u03c90 -B0 plane (at constant particle density\nand dipolar coupling strength). At low driving frequencies,\nthe change from unlayered to layered (and fully synchronized) structures occurring upon increase of B0 is related to\na quasi-equilibrium phase transition, i.e. a many-particle phenomenon. The transition is induced by the competition between the time-averaged, inverted dipolar interactions favoring in-plane configurations and the loss of translational entropy accompanying the one-dimensional translational order.\nWhile this competition also occurs for systems of polarizable\nor superparamagnetic particles, the additional complication in\nthe present system of permanent dipoles is that the field first\nneeds to overcome the dipolar fluctuations. Though we have\n10 |\n\n1\u201311\n\nneglected this issue in our DFT approach, we would expect\nthat the fluctuations just shift the transition predicted by the\nDFT towards larger field strength.\nCompletely different behavior is found at high frequencies\nand field strengths. Under these conditions, the picture of synchronously rotating dipoles (with constant phase difference\nrelative to the field) breaks down. Instead, one observes a mixture of rotating and counter-rotating or resting particles, as our\nanalysis of various angle distributions reveals. The desynchronization induces, at the same time, a breakdown of the translational, layered structure. Despite this complex many-particle\nbehavior, we have shown that the boundary can be well described in terms of the critical frequency \u03c9c (B0 ) that arises\nfrom a bifurcation in an effective single-particle approach for\nthe rotational motion in a viscous medium. This indicates that\nthe appearance of the high-frequency boundary is essentially\na friction-induced effect.\nA similar frequency-induced desynchronization effect has\nrecently been discussed by H\u00e4rtel et al., 23 who investigated a\nsystem of interacting elongated particles in a rotating electric\nfield via dynamic density functional theory. Assuming a constant number density, the important dynamic variable within\nthe density functional approach is the orientational distribution as function of time. At low and very high frequencies, the\ndistribution behaves similar to our distribution f in that there\nis either a single peak (reflecting synchronized motion with a\nconstant phase difference) or no peak at all. In the transition\nregime, however, H\u00e4rtel et al. detected various new dynamic\nstates characterized by time-dependent oscillations and splitting of the peak in the distribution as well as an overtaking\nby the driving field. In the present study we did not observe\nsuch states, not even when looking at the time-dependence of\nour orientational distributions (or the magnetization). It remains to be investigated whether these qualitative differences\nin the rotational motion of anisotropic many-particles systems\nare just due to differences in the specific model system, or\ndue to the fact that our results are based on a microscopic approach rather than on the density field approach used in Ref.\n23. Indeed, the relation between the microscopic and mesoscopic dynamics in driven systems is an issue also discussed\nin other, related contexts, such as the shear-induced dynamics\nof nanorods. 34\nFinally, it is worth to briefly comment on the relevance of\nour dimensionless model parameters in the context of real systems. The equilibrium parameters considered here (density\n\u03c1\u2217 = 0.1, dipolar coupling strength \u03bb \u2248 6.7) correspond to\nthose of a strongly coupled ferrofluid exhibiting chain formation. 14 Regarding the driving field, however, most of our\ndimensionless frequencies \u03c90\u2217 are probably beyond the currently accessible range. In many experiments involving rotating fields, the size of the (typically superparamagnetic) particles considered is about 1 \u03bcm. 4,11 A driving frequency of\n\n\f\u03c90\u2217 = 10 (which is well within the layered domain) then corresponds to an actual frequency of about 10 kHz if we assume\nroom temperature (T = 293 K) and a mass density of 5 g/cm3 .\nThis is 1-2 orders of magnitudes larger than the frequencies\nused in the literature. 4,11 Ferrocolloidal particles, which have\npermanent dipoles (such as the ones considered here), are often much smaller with sizes of about 10 nm. In that case,\n\u03c90\u2217 = 10 corresponds to a driving frequency of about 1 GHz.\nThese considerations suggest that realistic driven systems\nwill be fully synchronized and layered according to our\n\"phase\" diagram in Fig. 4. We note, however, that the actual location of the desynchronization line encountered upon\nincreasing \u03c90\u2217 depends on the friction constant used in our BD\nsimulations; i.e., increasing the friction constant shifts the line\ntowards lower frequencies (consistent with the single-particle\ntheory). Moreover, we have neglected in our study the manyparticle character of the hydrodynamic interactions induced\nby the solvent. We would expect these interactions to effectively increase the friction and thus shift the boundary towards\neven lower frequencies. Clearly, it would be very interesting\nto actually incorporate such interactions by using refined simulation methods such as, e.g., stochastic rotation dynamics. 35\nHydrodynamic interactions may also be relevant to better explore phenomena such as chain-to-cluster transitions that have\nbeen revealed by recent studies. 4 These issues, as well as the\ndynamic behavior in even more complex field geometries, will\nbe the subject of future studies.\n\n5 Acknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge financial support from the DFG\nwithin the research training group RTG 1558 Nonequilibrium\nCollective Dynamics in Condensed Matter and Biological Systems, project B1.\n\n11 N.
