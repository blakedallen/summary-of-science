Especially, in the Universal Extra Dimensions (UED) model [1],\nthe lightest KK particles (LKP) with an odd parity is stable and can be a candidate for the\ndark matter. The UED can also lower constraints on the compactification scale from the\nelectroweak (EW) precision measurements to few hundred GeV due to the five-dimensional\n(5D) Lorentz symmetry [2, 3], while the scale is restricted to be larger than few TeV for\nthe brane localized fermion (BLF) scenario [4]-[9]. If the KK-modes are confirmed at the\nCERN LHC experiment, it would strongly indicate the existence of the extra dimensions.\nOn the other hand, anther interesting phenomenological consequence of the extradimensional theory is the top Yukawa deviation, which is a deviation of the Yukawa coupling between top quark and physical Higgs field from the naive SM expectation: mt /vEW .\nSuch a deviation is generally caused when there are several Higgs doublets. Recently it\nhas been pointed out that the deviation can be induced from effects of the brane localized\nHiggs potentials [10, 11] and the Dirichlet boundary condition (BC) [12] in a simple setup\nof the extra-dimensional theory with one Higgs doublet.1\nIn this paper, we study a 5D model [12] where the gauge bosons and Higgs doublet of\nthe SM exist in the 5D bulk compactified on a line segment with a flat metric, imposing a\ngeneric Dirichlet BC for the Higgs and Neumann BC for all other SM fields. The vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV) of the Higgs is induced from the Dirichlet BC which is generally\nallowed in higher dimensional theories. We present wave-function profiles of bulk fields\nunder these BCs. The Dirichlet BC removes the Higgs zero-mode and one might worry\nhow a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson is supplied for the electroweak symmetry breaking.\nWe show that a superposition of sufficiently large number of KK-modes gives a correct\nwave-function profile which is flat except at the boundaries.\nWe consider the case where all other SM fermions propagate in the bulk as the UED\nmodel. Then, we will give detailed phenomenology of the model on the top Yukawa deviation, the production and decay of Higgs, constraints on the model from the electroweak\nprecision measurements, and dark matter.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we present our extradimensional setup and show the profiles, masses and couplings of bulk Higgs and gauge\nfields. In Section 3, we discuss phenomenological aspects of the setup such as top Yukawa\ndeviation, the production and decay of the Higgs, constraints from the EW precision mea1\n\nYukawa deviation is considered in a warped gauge-Higgs unification model [13], and a deviation between\nSM-field and flavon is considered in [14].\n\n1\n\n\fsurements, and dark matter candidate. In Section 4, we summarize our results. In Appendix we show the 5D gauge and Higgs kinetic Lagrangian and the gauge fixing.\n\n2\n\nBulk Higgs and its profiles\n\nOur setup is that the SM Higgs doublet exists in the 5D flat space-time with Dirichlet BC.\nWe study the Higgs wave-function profiles, masses and couplings at first. Our analysis is\napplicable in more general cases though we will focus on the case where EW symmetry is\nbroken through the extra-dimensional BC.\n\n2.1\n\nVEV profile\n\nLet us show wave-function profile of classical mode, i.e. the VEV, of a bulk scalar field.\nStart from an illustrative example of the bulk complex scalar \u03a6 with the kinetic action\nZ\nZ +L/2\n4\nS=\u2212 d x\ndz |\u2202M \u03a6|2 ,\n(1)\n\u2212L/2\n\nM\n\nwhere we write 5D coordinates as x\n\n= (x\u03bc , z) with M, N, . . . running from 0 to 4 and\n\n\u03bc, \u03bd, . . . running from 0 to 3. The 5D spacetime is compactified on a line segment and the\naction is defined in \u2212L/2 \u2264 z \u2264 +L/2.\n\nNow let us impose a Dirichlet BC for the bulk scalar field. We consider the action, along\nwith all the BCs, is invariant under the KK parity, z \u2192 \u2212z. A compactification on the\nline segment with the Dirichlet BC [12] derives different physics from the orbifold S 1 /Z2\n\ncompactification with a brane-localized potential in an infinitely large coupling limit [10],\nsince the former does not have the uncontrollably large interactions involving the NG-boson\nas we will see.\n\u221a\nRewriting in terms of real fields, \u03a6 = (\u03a6R + i\u03a6I )/ 2, the variation of the action reads\n\u0015\nZ\nZ +L/2 \u0014\nL\nL\n4\n\u03b4S = d x\ndz \u03b4\u03a6X (P\u03a6X ) + \u03b4(z \u2212 )\u03b4\u03a6X (\u2212\u2202z \u03a6X ) + \u03b4(z + )\u03b4\u03a6X (+\u2202z \u03a6X ) , (2)\n2\n2\n\u2212L/2\n\nwhere P \u2261 \u2737 + \u2202z2 . The VEV of the scalar field \u03a6c is determined by the action principle\n\u03b4S = 0, that is, P\u03a6cX = 0. The general solution of this Equation of Motion (EoM) is\n\u03a6c (z) = A + Bz. The undetermined coefficients A and B can be fixed by choosing BCs\n\nat z = \u00b1L/2. We have four choices of combination of Dirichlet and Neumann BCs at\nz = \u00b1L/2, namely,\n(D, D),\n\n(D, N),\n\n(N, D),\n\nand (N, N),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D and N denote the Dirichlet and Neumann BCs, respectively. These BCs are\nwritten as\n\u03b4\u03a6|z=\u03be = 0,\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\ffor the Dirichlet BC, and\n\u2202z \u03a6|z=\u03be = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nfor the Neumann BC, where \u03be is taken as +L/2 or \u2212L/2 in each case. Difference choice\n\nof BC corresponds to different choice of theory. A theory is fixed once one chooses one of\nthe four patterns of BC conditions.\nIn this paper, we will take the following (D, D) BC for a scalar field,\n\u03b4\u03a6|z=\u00b1L/2 = 0 and \u03a6|z=\u00b1L/2 = v\n\n(6)\n\non both branes, where v is a free complex constant of mass dimension [3/2]. Notice that\nthese BCs are the most general form of Dirichlet BCs which are consistent with the action\nprinciple. Here, we can determine the solution of EoM under these BCs as\n\u03a6c (z) = v,\n\n(7)\n\nso that the VEV profile on the extra-dimensional direction is flat. How about the profiles\nof quantum modes of the physical Higgs and NG bosons?\n\n2.2\n\nProfiles of physical Higgs and others\n\nLet us investigate wave-function profiles of its quantum fluctuation modes that correspond\nto the physical Higgs and NG modes by regarding \u03a6 as the bulk SM Higgs doublet. The\nmost general form of the Dirichlet BC on \u03a6(x, z) is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nL\nL\nv1\n,\n(8)\n\u03a6(x, \u00b1 ) =\n\u03b4\u03a6(x, \u00b1 ) = 0,\nv2\n2\n2\nwhere v1 and v2 are free complex constants. Without loss of generality, we can always take\na basis by an SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y field redefinition so that the BCs become\nL\n\u03b4\u03a6(x, \u00b1 ) = 0,\n2\n\u0012 \u0013\nL\n0\n\u03a6(x, \u00b1 ) =\n,\nv\n2\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nand thus, the resultant VEV profile is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\n0\nc\n\u03a6 (z) =\n.\nv\n\n(11)\n\nThe Higgs doublet \u03a6 is KK-expanded around the VEV in Eq.(11) by infinite number of\n4D fields as\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03a6(x, z) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nv+\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n+\nfn\u03c6 (z)\u03c6+\nn (x)\n\nn=0\n\n[fnH (z)Hn (x)\n\nn=0\n\n3\n\n+\n\nifn\u03c7 (z)\u03c7n (x)]\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(12)\n\n\f\u221a\nwhere we took \u03a6R / 2 = v and \u03a6I = 0 in the language of the previous subsection, and\n(n)\nHn (x) are the physical Higgs scalar. A linear combination of \u03c7n (x) and Zz (x) and that\n(n)+\n(n)\nof \u03c6+\n(x) are, respectively, absorbed as the longitudinal component of Z\u03bc\nn (x) and Wz\n(n)+\n\nand W\u03bc , where Zz and Wz are the fifth components of 5D Z and W bosons. Notice\nthat the orthogonal combinations to above ones are the physical neutral pseudo-scalar and\ncharged bosons, respectively.\nThe 5D action for H(x, z) can be written as\nSH =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n+L/2\n\ndz\n\n\u2212L/2\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u03b4(z \u2212 L/2)\nH(\u2737 + \u2202z2 )H +\nH(\u2212\u2202z H)\n2\n2\n\u0015\n\u03b4(z + L/2)\nH(+\u2202z H) ,\n+\n2\n\n(13)\n\nand the KK equation for the physical Higgs is given by\n\u2202z2 fnH (z) = \u2212\u03bc2Hn fnH (z),\n\n(14)\n\nwhere general solution of this KK equation is\nfnH (z) = \u03b1n cos(\u03bcHn z) + \u03b2n sin(\u03bcHn z).\n\n(15)\n\nTaking the Dirichlet BCs in Eq.(9) for quantum fluctuation, we obtain\nfnH (z = \u00b1L/2) = 0,\nand hence the wave-function profiles become\n\uf8f1 q\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(n+1)\u03c0\n2\n\uf8f2\ncos\nz\nqL\n\u0010 L \u0011\nfnH (z) =\n2\n\uf8f3\nsin (n+1)\u03c0 z\nL\n\nL\n\n(16)\n\nfor even n,\nfor odd n.\n\n(17)\n\nThey are are shown in Table 1.2 It is worth noting that the wave-function profile of the\nlowest (n = 0) mode, which corresponds to the SM-like Higgs, is described by a cosine\nfunction,\nf0H (z) =\n\nr\n\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\n2\ncos\nz .\nL\nL\n\n(18)\n\nNotice that, if we took Neumann BC for the Higgs, the flat profile of the lowest mode\nappears.\n2\n\nThey look similar to the limit of the large boundary coupling discussed in the setup with brane localized\nHiggs potential [10]. However, we do not have the large boundary coupling involving the NG modes in the\ncurrent model. The non-flat profile of the physical Higgs field becomes cosine function in Eq.(17), where\nthe KK number n is shifted by unity from the one in other literature, in accordance with [10].\n\n4\n\n\fTypical profiles of Higgs field\nn=1\nn=2\n\nn=0\n\nL\u00902\n\n-L\u00902\n\nL\u00902\n\n-L\u00902\n\n-L\u00902\n\nn=3\n\nL\u00902\n\n-L\u00902\n\nL\u00902\n\nTable 1: The wave-function profiles of the physical Higgs\nThis is one of the interesting results from this simple setup of taking Dirichlet BC for\nthe bulk Higgs doublet, and this property leads to interesting phenomenology such as the\ntop Yukawa deviation.\nThe n-mode Higgs mass is calculated as\n\u00132\n\u0012\nZ +L/2\n(n + 1)\u03c0\n2\nH\n2 H\n,\nmH (n) = \u2212\ndzfn (z)\u2202z fn (z) =\nL\n\u2212L/2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the mass of the lowest (n = 0) mode Higgs becomes the KK scale:\nmKK \u2261\n\n\u03c0\n.\nL\n\n(20)\n\nThis feature of KK-scale Higgs mass is the specific result induced from the Dirichlet BC\nin Eq.(16). Note that one does not have a theoretical constraint on the magnitude of the\nHiggs mass from the discussions of perturbative unitarity as in the SM since the mass\ndepends on the compactification scale but not on the Higgs self-coupling (see, footnote 2).\nProfiles of n-mode of \u03c7(n) and \u03c6+(n) are the same as H (n) , because the 5D action of \u03c7(x)\n+\nand \u03c6+ (x) have the same form as that of H(x). Therefore, fn\u03c7 (z) and fn\u03c6 (z) also obey the\nsame KK equations as fnH (z). Taking this Dirichlet BC is similar to introducing an extra\nfake Higgs field \u03c6 which is localized at the boundary and couples to the bulk Higgs doublet\nas |\u03c6|2 (|\u03a6|2 \u2212 v 2 ) and with a limit of |h\u03c6i| \u2192 \u221e. But, a crucially different point is that\nthe three- and four-point Higgs self-couplings of HHH, H\u03c7\u03c7, H\u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 , HHHH, HH\u03c7\u03c7,\nHH\u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 , \u03c7\u03c7\u03c7\u03c7, \u03c7\u03c7\u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 , and \u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 \u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 vanish in the current model, since there is no\nHiggs potential. (Here and hereafter we represent the lowest KK-modes of the bulk Higgs\nby H(x), \u03c7(x), and \u03c6+ (x), for simplicity.) It means that longitudinal components of gauge\nbosons, WL and ZL , interact only through the gauge couplings.\n\n2.3\n\nProfiles of gauge fields\n\nNext, we show the gauge sector. We take usual Neumann BC for the gauge fields as\n\u2202z A\u03bc (z)|z=\u00b1L/2 = 0 and Az (z)|z=\u00b1L/2 = 0.\n5\n\n(21)\n\n\fThe gauge boson masses are derived from the Higgs kinetic term as\nSkin =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n+L/2\n\ndx|DM \u03a6|2\n\n(22)\n\n\u2212L/2\n\nwith the covariant derivative\na a\nDM \u2261 \u2202M + ig5 WM\nT + ig5\u2032 BM Y,\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere the 5D gauge couplings are related to the 4D ones by g5 = g L and g5\u2032 = g \u2032 L.\nThe SM gauge bosons are given by\nZM \u2261\n\n3\ng5 WM\n\u2212 g5\u2032 BM\np\n,\ng5 + g5\u2032\n\nAM \u2261\n\n3\ng5 WM\n+ g5\u2032 BM\np\n,\ng5 + g5\u2032\n\n\u00b1\nWM\n\u2261\n\n1\n2\nWM\n\u2213 iWM\n\u221a\n.\n2\n\nTherefore, the KK equation for the weak bosons become\n\u0015\n\u0014\nv2 2\n\u20322\n\u2202z \u2212 (g5 + g5 ) fnZ (z) = \u2212\u03bc2Zn fnZ (z),\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nv2 2 W\n\u2202z \u2212 g5 fn (z) = \u2212\u03bc2W n fnW (z).\n2\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nIt is seen that the Neumann BCs for the gauge fields guarantees the flatness of profiles of\nthe zero-mode gauge fields. Then, the usual gauge boson masses are given by3\nm2Z =\n\n2\n(g 2 + g \u20322 )vEW\n,\n2\n\nm2W =\n\n2\ng 2 vEW\n,\n2\n\n(27)\n\n\u221a\nwhere v = vEW / L. The masses of nth KK-modes are described as\nmZ (n) = m2Z + n2 m2KK ,\n\nmW (n) = m2W + n2 m2KK ,\n\n(28)\n\nand we find that the n-mode Higgs mass is the same as the (n + 1)-mode KK gauge boson\nmasses. The frequency of n-mode Higgs profile is also the same as that of (n + 1)-mode\nKK gauge bosons' profiles (see footnote 2). These results are originating from the Dirichlet\n(Neumann) BC for the bulk Higgs (gauge) field.\nHere we focus on the Higgs mechanism of the zero-mode gauge bosons in more detail.\nAs discussed above, although the VEV itself has a flat profile, the 5D fields \u03c7(x, z) and\n\u03c6\u00b1 (x, z) have not zero-mode. Notice also that the lowest mode of the W\u03bc\u00b1 (x, z) and Z\u03bc (x, z)\nare flat at the tree level. Therefore, \u03c6 and \u03c7 must somehow yield the flat profile to be\n(0)\u00b1\n\n(0)\n\nabsorbed into W\u03bc\nand Z\u03bc . Key observation is that the NG-boson that is absorbed by\nthe zero-mode W (or Z) is composed by a linear combination of n = 0 to \u221e modes of\n3\n\nNote that the resultant Z and W masses could be correct ones due to the custodial symmetry even\nunder the bulk Higgs mass. In this paper, the bulk potential is assumed to be zero, for simplicity.\n\n6\n\n\f(0)\n\nNG boson. For example, ZL absorbs the following field having flat profile along the 5D\ndirection except at the boundary,\n\u03c7(x, z) = 0,\n\n(z = \u00b1L/2),\n\n(29)\n\n\u03c7(x, z) = \u03c7NG (x),\n\n(\u2212L/2 < z < L/2),\n\n(30)\n\nwhich can be realized by a superposition of the infinite number of modes\n\u03c7(x, z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nfn\u03c7 (z)\u03c7n (x),\n\n(31)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere\n\u221a\n2 2L(\u22121)n/2\n\u03c7n (x) =\n\u03c7NG (x),\n(n + 1)\u03c0\n\n(32)\n\nfor even n.4 By rewriting n = 2m, we can show\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\n(2m + 1)\u03c0\n4(\u22121)m\ncos\nz .\n\u03c7(x, z) = \u03c7NG (x)\n(2m\n+\n1)\u03c0\nL\nm=0\n\n(33)\n\nThis profile exactly realizes the flat profile in Eqs.(29) and (30).\nThe 5D gauge theory is non-renormalizable and hence is defined with a ultraviolet\ncutoff. Therefore, one might think that the sum should be taken up to a finite value of\nm corresponding to a cutoff scale \u039b = mmKK = m\u03c0/L. Let us see the correspondence\nbetween the cutoff scale \u039b, equivalently the maximum m, and the flatness of the would-be\nNG mode \u03c7(x, z),5 which is represented in Fig. 1. In our setup, the KK scale is a model\nparameter constrained from the precision EW measurements. For example, when m = 104\nand mKK = 600 (4 \u00d7 103) GeV are taken, the cutoff scale of this setup becomes \u039b = 6 \u00d7 103\n(4 \u00d7 104 ) TeV.\n\nThen, what should we think the 5D cutoff? There must exist heavier KK-modes than\nthe cutoff scale in principle, otherwise the complete flat profile of NG bosons could not\nbe obtained. There is generally a high energy cutoff in this 5D model so that we cannot\nsum over infinite number of KK-modes. However, a model with a cutoff \u039b is expected to\nhave an ambiguity of O(\u039b\u22121 ), which are induced from integrating out heavier KK-modes\nabove \u039b. In order to distinguish this ambiguity, for example, deviation from flat profile in\nabove case, we need an experimental resolution of O(\u039b\u22121 ), so that the ambiguity could be\nneglected.\nR +L/2\n\u03c7n (x) can be calculated from \u03c7n (x) = \u2212L/2 dzfn\u03c7 (z)\u03c7NG (x). Thus, there are contributions to \u03c7n (x)\nfrom only even n-mode.\n5\nAn n-th partial sum of the Fourier series has an oscillation near the discontinuity points which is\nknown as the Gibbs phenomenon. This is the reason why we must consider higher KK-tower to realize the\nprofile of Eqs.(29) and (30).\n4\n\n7\n\n\f(b)\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a7Hx,zL\u0090 \u03a7NG HxL\n\n\u03a7Hx,zL\u0090 \u03a7NG HxL\n\n(a)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n2z\u0090L\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n2z\u0090L\n\n\u03a7Hx,zL\u0090 \u03a7NG HxL\n\n\u03a7Hx,zL\u0090 \u03a7NG HxL\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n1.0\n\n2z\u0090L\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n2z\u0090L\n\nFigure 1: The relation between the flatness of VEV profile and largeness of m.

We note that in several models of orbifold/boundary symmetry breaking, it has been shown that the longitudinal gauge boson scattering etc. are indeed unitarized by taking into account KK-mode contributions [15]-[22]. Therefore, it would be\nexpected that the bulk gauge boson scattering is unitarized in such a region of our model\n(above the KK scale but lower than the 5D cut-off scale) by taking account all the relevant\nKK-modes.\nAt the end of this section, we comment on the KK parity. It is known that the UED\nmodel conserves KK parity. How about our setup? In our model, the Dirichlet BC is taken\nfor the Higgs field, and when we take the same BC on both z = \u00b1L/2 branes, there exists\n\na reflection symmetry between the branes. This guarantees the conservation of the KK\nparity in the gauge and Higgs sector. Thus, the existence of KK parity in the Lagrangian\ndepends on a fermion sector. When the fermions are localized on the 4D branes, the KK\nparity is broken in general. On the other hand, the KK parity is conserved in a bulk\nfermion setup similar to the UED model. When KK parity exists in the model, the lightest\nKK parity odd particle is stable, which can be a candidate of the dark matter. We will\nreturn to this point later.\n\n3\n\nPhenomenological aspects\n\nIn this section, we discuss phenomenological aspects of above extra-dimensional setup,\nnamely top Yukawa deviation, the production and decay of the Higgs, constraints from the\nEW precision measurements, and dark matter candidate.\n\n3.1\n\nTop Yukawa deviation\n\nLet us investigate the top Yukawa deviation, which is one of the most interesting phenomenologies in our setup. First we give a brief explanation about the top Yukawa deviation. In the SM, the fermion mass terms and couplings with physical Higgs are given\nby\nH(x)  \u0304\n \u0304\nf (x)f (x),\n\u2212 LSM\nY \u2283 mf f (x)f (x) + yf \u221a\n2\n\n(34)\n\nwhere mf is the mass of a SM fermion f (x). The mass of fermion is described by the VEV\nof the Higgs multiplied by the Yukawa coupling, mf \u2261 yf vEW . This Yukawa coupling also\n9\n\n\fdetermines the magnitude of the coupling between fermion and the physical Higgs field,\n\u221a f \u0304f , and, thus\nyf \u0304f H H(x)\n2\nyf \u0304f H = yf .\n\n(35)\n\nThis is the simple tree level result in the SM. Among the Yukawa couplings in the SM, that\nof top quark is the largest. Therefore, this SM expectation in Eq.(35) should be checked\nby precisely observing the Higgs events related with the top quarks at the LHC. The\ndeviation of the expectation from the SM is called top Yukawa deviation and observation\nof this phenomena would suggest the presence of physics beyond the SM. Here, we focus\non the top quark when we discuss the Yukawa deviation.\nIt is well known that such a deviation can generally occur in multi-Higgs model. A\npopular multi-Higgs model is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), in\nwhich the coupling of the top quark with the physical Higgs field is described as\nh0\n\u221a\nt\u0304t,\n\u2212 LMSSM\n\u2283\ny\ncos\n\u03b1\nt\nt\n2\n\n(36)\n\nwhile the Yukawa coupling of top quark is determined by yt = mt /vu . It is seen that the\nadditional factor, cos \u03b1, is multiplied to the Yukawa coupling. The physical meaning of\nthis factor is a mixing angle between the weak eigenstate of the Higgs (Hu0 , Hd0 ) and the\nmass eigenstate (h0 , H 0 ) where h0 is the lightest CP-even Higgs field. Such a situation\ngenerally occurs in other multi-Higgs doublet models, but never happens in 4D one-Higgs\ndoublet model.\nIn our model described with the Dirichlet BC, the Yukawa interaction for the top quark\nand the Higgs field are written as\n\u0015\nZ +L/2 \u0014\nH(x)\nH\nt\u0304(x, z)t(x, z).\n(37)\n\u2212 Lt = yt,5\ndz v + f0 (z) \u221a\n2\n\u2212L/2\nThe top quark mass, mt , and effective top coupling in 4D, yt , can be obtained as mt = yt,5 v\ny\n\n\u221at = \u221at,5 . Then the ratio of the top Yukawa coupling in our model to that of\nand yt = vm\nL\nL\nthe SM, rH t\u0304t , is given by\n\u221a\nZ L/2\n2\n2\n1\ndzf0H (z) =\n\u2243 0.90,\n(38)\nrH t\u0304t = \u221a\n\u03c0\nL \u2212L/2\n\nwhich means the top deviation in this setup is 10% decrease from the SM.6 Such result can\nbe hardly happened in other one-Higgs doublet models.7\n6\n\nIf the SM fermions are brane localized fields, the coupling between the top quark and Higgs boson\nin 4D is completely vanishing [12]. Such a kind of model can predict a maximal top Yukawa deviation,\nrH t\u0304t = 0.\n7\nA specific warped gauge-Higgs unification model also induces the maximal top Yukawa deviation [13].\nHowever, the physical results are completely different, for example, the Higgs in [13] is stable, while the\none in our model decays quite rapidly as shown later.\n\n10\n\n\f(a) gluon fusion\n\n(b) vector boson fusion\n\nFigure 2: Dominant processes of Higgs production at the LHC\n\n3.2\n\nHiggs production and decay\n\nHere we consider the SM-like Higgs production, higher KK Higgs production, and Higgs\ndecay at the LHC experiment. At first, let us show the Higgs production processes.\n3.2.1\n\nHiggs production\n\nThe Higgs boson can be produced mainly through the following four different channels\n\u2022 gluon fusion gg \u2192 H shown in Fig. 2 (a),\n\u2022 vector boson fusion qq \u2192 qqH shown in Fig. 2 (b),\n\u2022 associated production with the weak gauge bosons q q\u0304 \u2192 W H, ZH,\n\u2022 associated production with the heavy quarks gg, q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304H, bb\u0304H and gb \u2192 bH.\nThe SM predicts that the gluon fusion with the top quark 1-loop diagram dominates up\nto 1 TeV of Higgs mass by taking account of leading and next-to-leading order of QCD\n\u221a\ncorrections with s = 14 TeV and mt = 174 GeV, while the vector boson fusion is a\nsubdominant process for the Higgs production. So how is going in our extra-dimension\nscenario? Since the Yukawa couplings of Higgs with the top quark are modified, the\nprocesses for the Higgs production must be reanalyzed.\nThe Higgs production cross section through the gluon fusion depends on the magnitude\nof the coupling between the top quarks and physical Higgs boson. Since the coupling\nbetween the top quarks and Higgs boson deviates from the top Yukawa coupling as is\npointed above, the cross section of the gluon fusion process becomes 81% of the SM due to\nrH t\u0304t \u2243 0.81. This is one of the most important predictions of our model. As regarding the\n\n11\n\n\fvector boson fusion process, the magnitude of cross section changes because the coupling\nbetween W and Higgs is also modified. The interaction is written by\n\u2212 LW W H\n\nemW 1\n=\n2 sin \u03b8W 2L\n\nZ\n\n+L/2\n\n\u2212L/2\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\ndzf0H (z)f0W f0W H(x)W + (x)W \u2212 (x) + h.c.\n\n(39)\n\nWhen we write the ratio of the W W H coupling in the 5D model to the SM as rW W H , it\nis given by\nrW W H\n\n1\n\u2261\u221a\nL\n\nZ\n\n+L/2\n\n\u2212L/2\n\ndzf0H (z),\n\n(40)\n\n\u221a\n\u00b1\nwhere we used the fact that the zero-mode profile of W boson is flat f0W (z) = 1/ L.\nNotice that this ratio is the same as rH t\u0304t in Eq.(38) and its value is \u2243 0.90. Therefore,\n\nthe cross section for the Higgs production in the model are overall decreased to 81% of the\nSM, while the branching ratios are not changed. It is because other possible processes for\n\nthe production such as q q\u0304 \u2192 HW , q q\u0304 \u2192 HZ, gg, q q\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304H, bb\u0304H, and gb \u2192 bH are also\nsuppressed in the same manner.\n3.2.2\n\nHigher KK Higgs production\n\nLet us consider the Higgs production of higher KK-modes, which might be discovered at the\nLHC and/or future international linear collider (ILC) experiment. In above discussions, we\nonly consider the lightest states of Higgs and top quark propagate in the loop of the gluon\nfusion process. However, in general, higher KK Higgs and heavy quarks can contribute in\nthis process.\nIn our model, a higher KK Higgs can be produced through the gluon fusion as\nq (2n) q\u0304 (2|n\u2212l\u22121|) \u2192 H (2(l+1)) ,\n\nq (2n) q\u0304 (2|n\u2212l|+1) \u2192 H (2l+1) ,\n\nq (2n+1) q\u0304 (2|n\u2212l|) \u2192 H (2l+1) ,\n\nq (2n+1) q\u0304 (|2(n\u2212l)\u22121|) \u2192 H (2(l+1)) ,\n\n(41)\n(42)\n(43)\n(44)\n\nwhere q are the heavy quarks circulating in the loop shown in Fig. 2 (a), and l, m, and\nn are 0, 1, 2, * * * , which indicate the KK number.8 The cross section (coupling) for each\n\nprocess is also suppressed by effect from the deformed Higgs profile compared with the\none in the UED case. For the vector boson fusion, the following KK parity conserving\n8\n\nWe are discussing in a basis where mixings among KK states are allowed in interactions of KK-quarks\nwith KK-gluon.\n\n12\n\n\fe\u2212(0)\n\nZ (l)\nZ (n)\n\ne+(0)\n\nH (m)\n\nFigure 3: Associated production of KK Higgs\nprocesses are possible,\nW (2n) W (2|n\u2212l\u22121|) \u2192 H (2(l+1)) ,\n\nW (2n) W (2|n\u2212l|+1) \u2192 H (2l+1) ,\n\nW (2n+1) W (2|n\u2212l|+1) \u2192 H (2l+1) ,\n\nW (2n+1) W (|2(n\u2212l)\u22121|) \u2192 H (2(l+1)) .\n\n(45)\n(46)\n(47)\n(48)\n\nFinally, we comment on the associated production of Higgs boson including higher KKmode shown in Fig. 3. It may be expected that the Higgs boson are produced through\nassociated process of\ne+(0) e\u2212(0) \u2192 Z (n)\u2217 \u2192 Z (l) H (m)\n\n(49)\n\nin the future linear collier experiment. Taking account of KK number, the internal Z (n)\nmust be Z (0) in the. The final Z (l) and H (m) must be the same KK-mode (l = m).\n3.2.3\n\nHiggs decay\n\nNext, let us study the Higgs decay. In the SM, the dominant decay process of Higgs boson\nis H \u2192 bb\u0304 for relatively small Higgs mass as mH . 140 GeV. The both branching ratios\nfor H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and H \u2192 gg can reach to about 0.08 at 100 GeV. mH . 120 GeV. The\n\nHiggs decays into two photons give clean experimental signatures whose branching fraction\nbecomes 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 at light Higgs boson masses. For a relatively heavy Higgs mass as 350\nGeV. mH , the first, second, and third dominant processes are H \u2192 W W , ZZ, and tt\u0304,\n\nrespectively. The branching fractions of these processes must be compared with our case\nsince the Higgs mass of our model is the same as the KK scale that is larger than the weak\n\n13\n\n\fscale.

As we will discuss later, since the Higgs mass of our model should be 430 GeV .\nmH . 500 GeV, the reliability of SM Higgs boson discovery should be compared in this\nrange.\nIn our model, we have the overall suppression factor for H \u2192 W W , ZZ, and tt\u0304 processes. Contrary to the SM, the H \u2192 W W (ZZ) process of our model occurs only through\ngauge interactions, since the couplings of NG bosons such as H\u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 (H\u03c7\u03c7) vanish.

The width Eq.(54) is smaller than that\n2\nof SM because of the factor rW\nWH.\nReminding that mH = mKK \u226b mW in our model, one might think that the Higgs\n\u2212\ndecay process was equivalent to the process of H \u2192 \u03c6+\nNG \u03c6NG based on the equivalence\n9\n\nFor the Higgs mass region of 115 GeV. mH . 2mZ , the decay channel can give a clean signature.\nAssuming a magnitude of integrated luminosity as 30 fb\u22121 , the signal can be detected with a significance\nof more than 5\u03c3 for 130 GeV. mH . 180 GeV, except in a narrow range around 170 GeV where the decay\nmode into W W opens.\n\n14\n\n\f\u00b1\ntheorem for the NG boson, where \u03c6\u00b1\nNG is the NG mode eaten by the lowest mode of W .\nSince there exists no Higgs potential in our model at the tree level, the Higgs cannot couple\n\u2212\nto \u03c6+\nNG \u03c6NG , which might be interpreted that the Higgs would decay to two gauge bosons\n\nonly through the transverse mode of gauge bosons and that the Higgs decay width was\nexpressed as Eq.(50). It is, however, not accurate. The would-be NG bosons \u03c6\u00b1\nNG are\nabsorbed into W \u00b1 whose wave-function profiles are given by Eqs.(29) and (30). As shown\nin the previous section, it is realized by the linear combination of all higher KK-modes,\nwhich means that a lot of heavier KK states other than the lowest mode are included. The\nequivalence theorem does not hold for the decay of the lowest physical Higgs mode. The\nHiggs can decay into W + W \u2212 through the longitudinal component of W \u00b1 , whose decay\nwidth dominates over the one through the transverse modes. The total decay width can\nbe well approximated as Eq.(54).\n\n3.3\n\nElectroweak precision measurements\n\nNext, let us discuss constraints from EW precision measurements on this setup.

Since a contribution to S and T\nparameter from the KK Higgs modes are small at mKK . 500 GeV, we drop the corresponding terms. We have not truncated the KK sum but performed it for infinite modes.\nGenerically this is known to be a good strategy that does not spoil the five dimensional\ngauge symmetry at short distances. Notice that Higgs mass and KK top contributions are\nnegative and positive for T parameter, respectively, while they contribute positive for S\nparameter. This is the reason why a heavy Higgs is consistent with S and T parameters\ncontrary to the SM. The (S, T ) plot in this setup is presented in Fig. 4. We plot the\nparameters in a region of 300 GeV \u2264 mH \u2264 1 TeV, and take the reference Higgs mass as\n\n117 GeV. We find that the first KK Higgs mass mH = mKK is constrained in the range\n430 GeV . mH . 500 GeV within 90% CL. Our plot roughly corresponds a diagonal line\n\nmH = 1/R in Fig. 3 of Ref. [2], which gives 370 GeV . mH = 1/R . 550 GeV within 90%\nCL from the data 2002.\n16\n\n\f3.4\n\nDark matter\n\nWe comment on a dark matter (DM) candidate in our model. In the UED model, the\nlightest KK particle (LKP) can be a candidate for the DM because the KK parity is\nalways conserved. The possibility that the KK photon becomes the LKP, and thus the\nDM candidate, has been widely discussed in a lot of literatures (see e.g. [29] for review and\nreferences).\nIf there is a reflection symmetry for the BCs in this scenario, the KK parity is conserved,\nand thus the LKP with odd (n = 1) parity is stable, which can be a DM candidate. The\nmasses of nth KK excitation states, X (n) , of SM field are given by\nm2X (n) = n2 m2KK + m2X (0) ,\n\n(64)\n\nat tree level, where X (0) and mX (0) indicate the corresponding SM field and its mass. The\nmass of the neutral Higgs can be rewritten as\nm2H (n) = m2H (n) + \u03b4m2H (n) ,\n\n(65)\n\nincluding the radiative corrections to the KK masses induced from loop diagrams traversing\naround the extra dimension. On the other hand, the correction to the KK photon is given\nby [30]\n\u03b4m2A(n)\n\n\"\n1\n1\n2\n\u03b4m2B(n) + \u03b4m2W (n) + (g 2 + g \u20322 )vEW\n=\n2\n2\ns\u001a\n#\n\u001b2\n1\n2\n2\n\u2212 (2gg \u2032vEW\n)2 ,\n\u03b4m2B(n) \u2212 \u03b4m2W (n) + (g 2 + g \u20322 )vEW\n+\n2\n\n(66)\n\nwhere\n1 g \u20322 2 2\n\u039b\n39 g \u20322 \u03b6(3) 2\nm\n\u2212\nn mKK ln\n,\nKK\n4\n2\n2 16\u03c0\n3 16\u03c0\nnmKK\n5 g 2\u03b6(3) 2\ng2 2 2\n\u039b\n= \u2212\nm\n+\n15\nn mKK ln\n.\nKK\n4\n2\n2 16\u03c0\n16\u03c0\nnmKK\n\n\u03b4m2B(n) = \u2212\n\n(67)\n\n\u03b4m2W (n)\n\n(68)\n\nIt is found that the LKP in our scenario is the KK photon naively since the mass of KK\nphoton is similar to the UED case and further the Higgs mass does not aquire negative\ncontribution from the quartic coupling as in UED.\n\n3.5\n\nFCNC problem\n\nFinally, let us comment that our setup does not suffer from serious flavor changing neutral\ncurrents (FCNCs) problem since the model have only one Higgs doublet. We note that in\nour scenario, all the bulk fermions have a flat wave-function profile at the tree level where\n17\n\n\fthe bulk and brane Higgs potentials are not generated via renormalization group running.\nTherefore there are no tree level FCNC processes coming from the overlap integral along\nthe extra-dimension. This is not affected by the fact that Higgs VEV and physical field\nhave different profile. One might think that contribution from a loop of charged KK Higgs\nfield is different from that in the UED model. However, the only difference is coming from\nthe change of the BC from Neumann to Dirichlet. Therefore, the overlap integral of two\nnth-modes and a single (flat) zero-mode are identical in these two models, giving the same\ncoupling. FCNC loop contributions from KK-modes are not different from the ordinary\nUED model [31]-[33].\n\n3.6\n\nComparison of models\n\nAt the end of section, we tabulate phenomenological results of our model in comparison\nwith other extra-dimensional models [10]. The models proposed in ref [10] have been\nconsidered in flat 5D spacetime with brane localized Higgs potential (BLP). The models\nof BLP have been classified into the BLF case and bulk fermion (BF) case, the latter\ncorresponding to a more general setup of the UED model. We refer to the models given in\n[10] as BLP(BLF) and BLP(BF) in this subsection. The phenomenological aspects of our\nmodel and comparisons of it with BLP(BLF) and BLP(BF) scenarios are given in Table 2.\nFinally, we comment on the KK masses including the radiative corrections and LKP\nas DM candidate in the BLP(BF) model. The radiative corrections for the neutral KK\nHiggs (65) can be estimated as\n\u03b4m2H (n)\n\nn2 m2KK\n\u2243\n16\u03c0 2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3 \u20322\n\u039b\n2\n3g + g \u2212 \u03bb\u0302 ln\n+ m\u03042H ,\n2\nnmKK\n\n(69)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0302 and m\u0304H indicate the Higgs quartic coupling and boundary mass term. Since the\nmass of KK photon including the radiative correction is the same as one of the UED and\nthe model discussed in this paper, the KK photon becomes the LKP as the DM candidate\nin the BLP(BF) model as long as the reliable Higgs quartic coupling and boundary mass\nterm are taken.10\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nWe have studied the 5D model where the all SM fields exist in the 5D bulk compactified on\nthe line segment with the flat metric. The wave-function profiles of the Higgs and gauge\nfields have been presented under the Dirichlet BC for the Higgs and the Neumann BC for\n10\n\nSee [10] for detailed descriptions of zero-mode Higgs mass and boundary mass term.

And, the \u03bb\u0302 is a quartic coupling of\nHiggs in the brane localized potential.\n19\n\n\fthe gauge fields on the branes. It has been shown that a sufficiently flat profile of the\nlongitudinal component of the zero-mode gauge boson can be obtained by a superposition\nof the KK-mode of NG bosons.\nWe have also presented phenomenological discussions on the top Yukawa deviation, the\nproduction and decay of Higgs, constraints on the model from the EW precision measurements, and dark matter candidate. In the model, the top Yukawa deviation of 10% is\npredicted. The cross section for the Higgs production, such as the gluon and W W fusions,\nin this model are over all decreased to 81% of the SM expectations. Therefore, the branching ratios are not changed. For the Higgs decay, the width of the process H \u2192 W W ,\n\nwhich is the dominant one, is as large as the Higgs mass. The evaluation of the S and T\nparameters suggests that the KK scale of 430 GeV . mH . 500 GeV is favored in this\nscenario.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to T.
