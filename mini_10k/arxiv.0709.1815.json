INTRODUCTION\nAs it is well known the emitted light output (photometric\nand/or radiometric flux) of LEDs strongly depends on the\njunction temperature (as shown in Figure 1 based on data\nfrom Lumileds Luxeon Datasheet DS25).\n\nIn section 2 we discuss, how LED package thermal\nmodels can be obtained directly from measurements, using structure functions. Here we describe a new measurement system which helped us creating a proper LED\nmodel. In section 3 we recall the basics of our electrothermal simulator and its extension to board level simulations utilizing compact thermal models of packages. We\nconclude the paper with an application example.\n2. CREATING LED PACKAGE COMPACT\nTHERMAL MODELS\nCreating compact thermal models (CTMs) of semiconductor device packages has been discussed in the literature\nfor over a decade. Nowadays the DELPHI approach ([3],\n[4], [5]) is being widely accepted for creating boundarycondition independent steady-state CTMs, especially for\nIC packages. A natural extension of these CTMs is towards the transient behavior, in order to obtain dynamic\ncompact thermal models (DCTMs). The methodology for\ncreating such DCTMs as well as extending existing thermal simulators [6] to handle such models was among the\nachievements of the PROFIT project [7].\nWhen boundary condition independence of the CTM\nis not required or there exists only a single junction-toambient heat-flow path realized by the package, the NID\n(network identification by deconvolution) method [8] is a\nviable alternative.\n2.1. LED package models directly from measurement\nresults\n\nFigure 1: Temperature dependence of light output for a family of green to blue and white power LEDs\n\nThis is an important issue e.g. in case of LED assemblies\nwhere a module realized on a metal-core PCB (MCPCB)\ncontains multiple devices and the uniformity of the light\noutput is important [1]. Such assemblies are often called\nlevel 2 devices while single, packaged power LEDs are\ndenoted as level 1.\nPrediction of the electrical, thermal and optical properties of level 2 devices requires a combined electricalthermal and optical model of level 1 as proposed already\nin [2]. It also needs proper modeling of the thermal environment.\n\n\u00a9TIMA Editions/THERMINIC 2006\n\n-page-\n\nHaving a closer look at a typical power LED package in\nits typical application environment (Figure 2) one may\nconclude, that the heat generated by the LED chip can\nbasically leave the package along a single path, through\nthe heat-slug, towards the MCPCB substrate.\nFor steady-state modeling, the package would be perfectly described by a single RthJC junction-to-case thermal\nresistance value, defined between the LED chip's junction\nand the heat-slug. This value can be easily identified from\nthermal transient measurements, using the so-called double interface method [9] on the level 1 device.\nAnother approach is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.\nA level 2 assembly was measured in two setups, denoted\n\u2022 BC1 \u2013 MCPCB directly on cold plate and\n\u2022 BC2 \u2013 MCPCB with a thin plastic sheet inserted\nbetween the board and cold plate\n\nISBN: 2-916187-04-9\n\n\fA. Poppe, G. Farkas and Gy. Horv\u00e1t\nElectrical, thermal and optical characterization of power LED assemblies\nconsidering the LED package during board level simulation to characterize single level 2 LED devices (Figure 2)\nor level 2 assemblies of multiple LEDs (Figure 8). Further\ndetails regarding LED package level modeling can be\nfound e.g. in [11].\n\nFigure 2: Junction-to-ambient heat-flow path in level 2 LED\nassembly: LED package glued to an MCPCB substrate\n\nIn the structure functions RthJC can be read in each function, based on the different thermal conductivity of copper\nand glue. The inserted sheet causes a change in the structure functions which helps identifying junction-to-board\nthermal resistance.\nIf dynamic compact model of the LED package is\nneeded, the single RthJC junction-to-case thermal resistance value has to be replaced by a proper model of the\nthermal impedance of the junction-to-case heat-flow path.\nStructure functions derived from thermal transients are of\ngreat help again. The cumulative structure is a map of the\nthermal capacitances and thermal resistances, smoothly\ndistributed along the junction-to-ambient heat-flow path.\nA step-wise approximation of the cumulative structure\nfunction (Figure 3) can be used to yield a set of lumped\nthermal resistance and thermal capacitance values for a\nCauer-type ladder model of a few stages. (In an earlier\nNID-based model generation [8], the discretization took\nplace in the time-constant spectrum.)\nThis method was already successfully used to model\nstacked-die IC packages [10]. At these packages there can\nbe multiple heat-flow paths, the generated RC ladder\nmodel can not be considered as unique model independent\nof the boundary conditions applied at the different surfaces of the package.\nIn case of LEDs there is only a single heat-flow path,\nthe RC ladder model of a few stages is perfect dynamic\ncompact thermal model of the LED package.\nAs the figures suggest at realistic cooling circumstances the structure function based LED package models\nare boundary condition independent, the change of the\ntest environment (in our case: the inserted plastic sheet)\nhas no effect on the portions of the structure function\nwhich describe the internal details of the package. In [11]\nit has been shown that changing the interface at the slug of\na level 1 device does not change the early sections either.\nThus, the ladder model of Figure 3 describing the heatflow path until the heat enters the MCPCB is suitable for\n\n\u00a9TIMA Editions/THERMINIC 2006\n\n-page-\n\nFigure 3: Cumulative structure functions: red 1W power\nLED on MCPCB and its 4-stage package model\n\nFigure 4: Differential structure functions: red 1W power\nLED on MCPCB\n\n2.2. Thermal and radiometric measurement of LEDs\nThermal transient measurements of semiconductor devices\nare based on the electrical test method [12]. In case of\nconventional devices the thermal resistance (or thermal\nimpedance for the dynamic case) is calculated from the\nmeasured temperature rise and the supplied electrical\npower. In case of high power LEDs however, this method\nis not applicable, since about 10-40% of the supplied en-\n\nISBN: 2-916187-04-9\n\n\fA. Poppe, G. Farkas and Gy. Horv\u00e1t\nElectrical, thermal and optical characterization of power LED assemblies\nergy leaves the device in form of light. That is why, if\nLED package models are to be derived directly from\nthermal measurements, one has to account for the emitted\noptical power. For this purpose we developed a test environment (Figure 5) which allows a combined thermal and\nradiometric measurement of power LEDs.\n\nOnce all optical measurements are performed the DUT\nLED is switched off and we measure its cooling transient,\nusing the T3Ster equipment of MicReD in a usual diode\nmeasurement configuration.\nThe thermal transient test yields the thermal resistance\nvalues, so the junction temperatures can also be calculated\nfrom the fixture temperatures.\nFrom the raw cooling transient we calculate the thermal impedance curve of the DUT, considering its emitted\noptical power. This impedance curve is converted into\nstructure functions from which the CTM of the LED\npackage is derived as discussed before.\n3. ELECTRO-THERMAL SIMULATION ON\nBOARD LEVEL\n3.1. Self-consistent electro-thermal simulation with\nsimultaneous simulation\n\nFigure 5: An automated photometric/radiometric measurement setup with a Peltier-cooled LED fixture, used in connection with the T3Ster thermal transient tester\n\nFigure 6: Emitted optical power of the 1W red power LED\nas function of the case temperature (solid curves) and junction temperature (dotted curves) at different bias current\n\nThe device under test is mounted to a Peltier-cooled\nfixture which is attached to an integrating sphere that is in\ncompliance with the applicable standards and recommendations of CIE [13]. The Peltier-cooled fixture stabilizes\nthe LED temperature during the optical measurements and\nit also serves as a cold-plate for thermal measurements.\nWith a radiometric measurement performed in (thermal\nand electrical) steady-state of the LED or LED assembly\nunder test, we can measure \u2013 among other parameters \u2013\nthe emitted optical power (Figure 6).\n\n\u00a9TIMA Editions/THERMINIC 2006\n\n-page-\n\nFor electro-thermal simulation of electronic circuits containing semiconductor devices we use the method of simultaneous iteration [14], [15].\nWhile boundary independence was an important requirement for the active semiconductor devices on a substrate (e.g. transistors on the monolithic die or LEDs on an\nMCPCB) the compact thermal model of the substrate itself should reflect the actual conditions at the device interfaces and the connection to the environment. The boundary condition dependent substrate model is calculated\naccording to the actual use. The thermal network of the\nsubstrate and the devices is solved together with the electrical one, simultaneously.\nFor connecting the two networks we have electrothermal semiconductor device models: each device is\ncompleted with a thermal node (see Figure 7). The dissipation of the device drives its thermal model network\nthrough this thermal node. The electric parameters of the\nsemiconductor device depend on the device temperatures\ncalculated from the complete thermal model. Using the\nanalogy between voltage and resistance, temperature and\nthermal resistance etc. the response of the coupled electric\nand thermal network is simulated simultaneously, maintaining a self-consistent solution [16], [17].\n3.2. Compact thermal model of the substrate\nThe core of any electro-thermal circuit simulator using\nsimultaneous iteration is how to generate and efficiently\nhandle a boundary condition dependent dynamic compact\nthermal model of the substrate. This thermal model network can be considered as a thermal N-port \u2013 its ports are\nterminated by the thermal nodes of the semiconductor\ndevices (Figure 7). This N-port model is characterized by\nN driving point impedances describing heat removal from\nthe given semiconductor directly to the ambient and\n\nISBN: 2-916187-04-9\n\n\fA. Poppe, G.

These\nresponses are calculated in advance, by using a very fast\nthermal simulator [19], providing the full set of NxN timeconstant spectra of all the thermal impedances of the substrate. Then the time constant spectra are turned into RC\nFoster models of a few stages (as the accuracy requires)\nand these are simulated together with the electrical part in\nan efficient way [20].\n\nFigure 7: Sketch of a simple electro-thermal diode model\nwith the N-port compact model of the substrate\n\n4. MULTI-DOMAIN LED MODEL\nIn case of LEDs one has to subtract the emitted optical\npower from the supplied electrical power. This is the heating power that is fed into the package compact model:\nPheat = Pel - Popt\n(1)\nIn our prior study we have shown, that some of the LED\ndevices may have a substantial dissipation on their electrical serial resistance [2]. Thus, the total heating power is\ndistributed between the junction and the series resistance:\n(2)\nPheat = PD \u2013 Popt + PR\nwhere PD denotes the electrical power dissipated on the\njunction and PR is the power dissipated on the serial resistance. The model parameters can be easily identified:\ncombined measurements for obtaining Popt were discussed\nin section 2.2, and the serial resistance of the device can\nbe measured electrically in the same setup.\nThis serial resistance may be close to the junction, or\nmight reside farther away, this way we can derive so\ncalled hot resistor or cold resistor type thermal models of\nan LED package. That is, the heat dissipated at the series\nresistance is fed into the junction-to-footprint heat-flow\npath either at the junction node, or further away, at a different node of the package model. This is a fact that one\nhas to reflect in the electro-thermal LED model.\n5. A CASE STUDY\n\n3.3. Board level extension\nThe thermal simulator calculates the thermal timeconstant spectra for every dissipating shape of the circuit\nautomatically. This algorithm works well for die level IC\nsimulation.\nWhen the temperature dependence of the electric device parameters is not critical we can use a thermal simulation only mode. The thermal simulator is already able of\nusing DCTMs of semiconductor device packages. Cosimulating these along with the detailed model of the\nPWB substrate we can already get device and substrate\ntemperatures [6].\nIn electro-thermal simulation we are interested in\nthermally influenced electric transient waveforms besides\ntemperature changes. With the recent extension packaged\nsemiconductor devices on any substrate can be represented by their DCTMs in electro-thermal simulation sessions [21]. The N-port model of the substrate is calculated\nin the same way as for a die level problem. In case of\npackaged devices considered with the DCTMs of their\n\n\u00a9TIMA Editions/THERMINIC 2006\n\npackages the N-port compact thermal model of the substrate is extended for the footprint shapes as well.\nThe DCTMs are inserted between the corresponding\nfootprint nodes of the substrate model and the junction\nthermal node of the electro-thermal device model and are\nsolved by the electro-thermal circuit simulation engine.\n\n-page-\n\nWe have investigated the RGB LED module shown in\nFigure 8. All the three LEDs are in identical packages. In\ncase of the green and blue LEDs of the module even the\nfine structures close to the junction are similar.\n\nFigure 8: The investigated LED module\n\n5.1. Measurements\nWe carried out \"plain\" thermal transient measurements as\nwell as combined thermal and radiometric ones. The\nthermal transient measurements were performed in a\nJEDEC standard still-air environment as well as on coldplate.

In the plot one can read at\nwhich time and thermal impedance the two heat-flow\npaths deviate. This measurement result supports our prior\nstatement, that at LED packages one may assume a single\npath from the junction towards the end of the heat-slug.\nThe plot also shows the transfer impedances in still air\n(GtoR and GtoB for green driven, red and blue measured).\nThe transfer effect on cold plate can be neglected.\n\nmal model has been obtained from cold-plate measurements. For checking its validity we simulated the LED\nmodule in a still-air environment \u2013 for which we also had\nmeasurement results for later comparison.\n\nFigure 10: Simulated thermal impedance plots at the three\njunctions of the LED module in still air, green LED driven\n\nFigure 9: Thermal impedance curves of the LED\nmodule in still air and cold plate setup.\nGreen LED driven, three junctions measured.\n\nThe measurements have also been carried out in the integrating sphere yielding efficiency data for the LEDs. We\nfound that the efficiency of the green LED degrades with\nincreasing cold-plate temperature, similarly to Figure 6.\nThe DCTM of the LED packages was identified according the procedure described in section 2.1 and was\nused in board-level simulations of the LED. The electrical\npart of the LED model was the standard LED model of\nour electro-thermal circuit simulation engine, parameterized for the actual LED devices.\n5.2.

Anything above 10s corresponds to the environment of the\nLED packages (MCPCB in still-air chamber).\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\n6. SUMMARY\nIn this paper we presented measurement and simulation\ntechniques for the multi-domain characterization of LED\ndevices and LED assemblies. In terms of measurement we\nhave been successfully using a combined thermal and radiometric measurement setup in order to be able to identify the actual thermal power that heats the junction of\nLED devices. The same measurement setup is also suitable to find the efficiency of the LEDs and to measure its\nbasic electrical parameters \u2013 all as functions of temperature.\nWe have presented a compact model identification\nmethod which yield CTMs for LED packages directly\nfrom thermal transient measurement results.\nOur die level electro-thermal simulation methodology\nhas been extended to board level problems. The CTMs of\nLED packages have been successfully applied in a board\nlevel simulation problem.\n7.
