The neighborhood N (x)\n\u2217\nThe author was partially supported by National Science Centre grant nr\n2011/01/D/ST/04104, as well as by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.\n\n1\n\n\fof a vertex x is the set of vertices adjacent to x, and the degree deg(x) of x\nis |N (x)|, the size of the neighborhood of x.\nLet w(x) =\n\nP\n\ny\u2208NG (x) l(y)\n\nfor every x \u2208 V (G).\n\nDistance magic labeling (also called sigma labeling) of a graph\nG = (V, E) of order n is a bijection l : V \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , n} with the property\nthat there is a positive integer k such that w(x) = k for every x \u2208 V .\nIf a graph G admits a distance magic labeling, then we say that G is\ndistance magic graph ([12]). The concept of distance magic labeling has\nbeen motivated by the construction of magic squares.\nThe following observations were independently proved:\nObservation 1.1 ([8, 9, 10, 12]). Let G be a r-regular distance magic graph\non n vertices. Then k = r(n+1)\n.\n2\nObservation 1.2 ([8, 9, 10, 12]). No r-regular graph with r-odd can be a\ndistance magic graph.\nProblem of distance magic labeling of r-regular graphs was studied recently (see [2, 3, 6, 9, 11]). It is interesting that if you blow up a r-regular G\ngraph into some specific p-regular graph (like C4 or K 2n ), then the obtained\ngraph H is distance magic. More formally, we have the following definition.\nDefinition 1.3. Let G and H be two graphs where {x1 , x2 , . . . , xp } are vertices of G. Based upon the graph G, an isomorphic copy H j of H replaces\nevery vertex xj , for j = 1, 2, . . . , p in such a way that a vertex in H j is\nadjacent to a vertex in H i if and only if xj xi was an edge in G. Let G[H]\ndenote the resulting graph.\nMiller at al. [9] proved the following results.\nTheorem 1.4 ([9]). The cycle Cn of length n is a distance magic graph if\nand only if n = 4.\nTheorem 1.5 ([9]). If r \u2265 1, n \u2265 3, G is an r-regular graph and Cn the\ncycle of length n. Then G[Cn ] admits a distance magic labeling if and only\nif n = 4.\nTheorem 1.6 ([9]). Let G be an arbitrary regular graph. Then G[K n ] is\ndistance magic for any even n.\n2\n\n\fThe following problem was posted in [2].\nProblem 1.7 ([2]). If G is non-regular graph, determine if there is a distance magic labeling of G[C4 ].\nIt seems to be very hard to characterize such graphs. For example\nthere were considered all graphs Km,n [C4 ] for 1 \u2264 m < n \u2264 2700 and only\nK9,21 [C4 ], K20,32 [C4 ], K428,548 [C4 ] are distance magic (see [1]).\nFroncek in [5] defined the notion of group distance magic graphs, i.e. the\ngraphs allowing the bijective labeling of vertices with elements of an abelian\ngroup resulting in constant sums of neighbor labels.\nDefinition 1.8. A group distance magic labeling or a G-distance magic\nlabeling of a graph G(V, E) with |V | = n is an injectionP\nf from V to an\nabelian group G of order n such that the weight w(x) = y\u2208NG (x) f (y) of\nevery vertex x \u2208 V is equal to the same element \u03bc \u2208 G, called the magic\nconstant.\nObviously, every graph with n vertices and a distance magic labeling\nalso admits a Zn -distance magic labeling. The converse is not necessarily\ntrue.\nIt was proved that Observation 1.2 is also true for G-distance magic\nlabeling ([4]) in case n \u2261 2( mod 4).\nObservation 1.9 ([4]). Let G be a r-regular distance magic graph on n \u2261 2(\nmod 4) vertices, where r is odd. There does not exists an abelian group G\nof order n such that G is G-distance magic.\nIn this paper we will prove that if G is a graph of order n = 2p (2k + 1)\nfor some natural numbers p, k such that deg(v) \u2261 c (mod 2p+1 ) for some\nconstant c for any v \u2208 V (G), then there exists an G-distance magic labeling\nfor any abelian group G for the graph G[C4 ]. Moreover we show that if G is\nan abelian group of order 4n such that G \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 A for some abelian\ngroup A of order n, then there exists a G-distance magic labeling for any\ngraph G[C4 ].\n\n2\n\nMain results\n\nWe start with the following lemma.\n\n3\n\n\fLemma 2.1. Let G be a graph of order n and G be an arbitrary abelian\ngroup of order 4n such that G \u223c\n= Z2p \u00d7 A for p \u2265 2 and some abelian group\nn\nA of order 2p\u22122\n. If deg(v) \u2261 c mod 2p\u22121 for some constant c and any\nv \u2208 V (G), then there exists a G-distance magic labeling for the graph G[C4 ].\nProof. Let G has the vertex set V (G) = {x0 , x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 }, C4 =\nv0 v1 v2 v3 v0 and H = G[C4 ].\nFor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and j = 0, 1, 2, 3, let vji be the vertices of H that\nreplace xi , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 in G.\nIf g \u2208 G, then we can write that g = (w, ai ) for w \u2208 Z2p and ai \u2208 A for\ni = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\nLabel the vertices of H in the following way\n\u0001\n\u001a\n(2i + j) mod 2p\u22121 , a\u230ai*2\u2212p+2 \u230b for j = 0, 1\ni\nf (vj ) =\ni\n(2p \u2212 1, 0) \u2212 f (vj\u22122\n)\nfor j = 2, 3\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\nNotice that for every i\nf (v0i ) + f (v2i ) = f (v1i ) + f (v3i ) = (2p \u2212 1, 0).\nSo the sum of the labels in the ith part is\nf (v0i ) + f (v1i ) + f (v2i ) + f (v3i ) = (2p \u2212 2, 0),\nwhich is independent of i. Since c \u2261 deg(v) (mod 2p\u22121 ) for any v \u2208 V (G),\ntherefore, for every x \u2208 V (H)\nw(x) = (\u22122c \u2212 1, 0).\n\nTheorem 2.2. Let G be a graph of order n and G be an arbitrary abelian\ngroup of order 4n such that G \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 A for some abelian group A of\norder n. There exists a G-distance magic labeling for the graph G[C4 ].\nProof. Let G has the vertex set V (G) = {x0 , x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 } and C4 =\nv0 v1 v2 v3 v0 . For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and j = 0, 1, 2, 3, let vji be the vertices of H\nthat replace xi , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 in G.\nIf g \u2208 G, then we can write that g = (j1 , j2 , ai ) for j1 , j2 \u2208 Z2 and ai \u2208 A\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\nLabel the vertices of H in the following way\n4\n\n\f\uf8f1\n(0, 0, ai )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1, 0, ai )\nf (vji ) =\n(1,\n1, \u2212ai )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(0, 1, \u2212ai )\n\nfor j = 0,\nfor j = 1,\nfor j = 2,\nfor j = 3\n\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\n\nNotice that for every i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1\nf (v0i ) + f (v2i ) = f (v1i ) + f (v3i ) = (1, 1, 0).\nSo the sum of the labels in the ith part is\nf (v0i ) + f (v1i ) + f (v2i ) + f (v3i ) = (0, 0, 0),\nwhich is independent of i. Therefore, for every x \u2208 V (H),\nw(x) = (1, 1, 0).\n\nTheorem 2.3. Let G be a graph of order n and G be an abelian group of\norder 4n. If n = 2p (2k + 1) for some natural numbers p, k and deg(v) \u2261 c\n(mod 2p+1 ) for some constant c for any v \u2208 V (G), then there exists a Gdistance magic labeling for the graph G[C4 ].\nProof.\nThe fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that the finite\nabelian group G can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of\nprime-power order. This implies that G \u223c\n= Z2\u03b10 \u00d7 Zp\u03b11 1 \u00d7 Zp\u03b12 2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Zp\u03b1mm\nQ\nm\nfor some \u03b10 > 0, where 4n = 2\u03b10 i=1 p\u03b1i i and pi for i = 1, . . . , m are not\nnecessarily distinct primes.\nSuppose first that G \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7Z2 \u00d7A for some abelian group A of order n, then\nwe are done by Theorem 2.2. Observe now that the assumption deg(v) \u2261 c\nmod 2p+1 and unique decomposition of any natural number c into powers\nof 2 apply that there exist constants c1 , c2 , . . . , cp such that deg(v) \u2261 ci\nmod 2i for i = 1, 2, . . . , p for any v \u2208 V (G). Hence if G \u223c\n= Z2\u03b10 \u00d7 A for some\n2 \u2264 \u03b10 \u2264 p + 2 and some abelian group A of order 24n\n\u03b10 , then we obtain\nby Lemma 2.1 that there exists a G-distance magic labeling for the graph\nG[C4 ].\n\n5\n\n\fThe observation follows easily from the above Theorem 2.3, however the\nbelow Observation 2.5 shows an infinite family of Eulerian graphs with odd\norder such that none of graphs was distance magic.\nObservation 2.4. Let G be a graph of odd order n and G be an abelian\ngroup of order 4n. If G is an Eulerian graph (i.e. all vertices of the graph\nG have even degrees), then there exists a G-distance magic labeling for the\ngraph G[C4 ].\nBefore we proof the Observation 2.5 we need the following definition.\nt is the graph obtained by taking t > 1 copies\nThe Dutch windmill graph Dm\nof the cycle Cm with a vertex c in common ([7]). Thus for t being even a\ngraph D4t is an Eulerian graph of odd order 3t + 1. Let ith copy of a cycle\n(t)\n(t)\nin C4 is cy i xi z i c for i = 0, . . . , t \u2212 1, C4 = v0 v1 v2 v3 v0 and H = C4 [C4 ].\nFor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1 and j = 0, 1, 2, 3, let xij (yji , zji , cj resp.) be the vertices of\n(t)\n\nH that replace xi (y i , z i , c, resp.) 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1 in C3 .\n(t)\n\nObservation 2.5. There does not exist a distance magic graph C4 [C4 ].\n(t)\n\nProof. Suppose that C4 [C4 ] is a distance magic graph. It is easy to observe\nthat:\n\u2022 l(c0 ) + l(c2 ) = l(c1 ) + l(c3 ) = ac .\n\u2022 l(xi0 ) + l(xi2 ) = l(xi1 ) + l(xi3 ) = aiy for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1.\n\u2022 l(y0i ) + l(y2i ) = l(y1i ) + l(y3i ) = aiy for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1.\n\u2022 l(z0i ) + l(z2i ) = l(z1i ) + l(z3i ) = aiz for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1.\nSince w(zji ) = aiy +2aix +2ac = w(yji ) = aiz +2aix +2ac we obtain that aiy =\n= ai for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t\u22121. Moreover w(xij ) = aix +4ai = w(yji ) = ai +2aix +2ac ,\nhence aix = 3ai \u2212 2ac . Furthermore w(zji ) = 7ai \u2212 2ac = w(yjl ) = 7al \u2212 2ac\nimplies that ai = al = a.\nSince 7a \u2212 2ac = ac + 4ta = k it has to be that 3ac = (7 \u2212 4t)a and\ntherefore t = 1 (because ac , a > 0), a contradiction.\naiz\n\nThe following observation shows that inverse of the Theorem 2.3 is not\ntrue:\nObservation 2.6. Let Kp,q be such complete bipartite graph that p is even\nand q is odd and G be an abelian group of order 4(p + q). There exists a\nG-distance magic labeling for the graph G[C4 ].\n6\n\n\fProof.\nIf G \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 A for some abelian group A of order p + q, then there exists\na G-distance magic labeling for the graph Kp,q [C4 ] by Theorem 2.2. Suppose\nnow that G \u223c\n= Z4 \u00d7 A for some abelian group A of order p + q. Let Kp,q has\nthe partition vertex sets A = {x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 }, B = {y 0 , y 1 , . . . , y q\u22121 } and\nC4 = v0 v1 v2 v3 v0 . For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and j = 0, 1, 2, 3, let xij (yjl respectively)\nbe the vertices of Kp,q [C4 ] that replace xi 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1 (y i 0 \u2264 l \u2264 q \u2212 1\nrespectively) in Kp,q . If g \u2208 G, then we can write that g = (j, ai ) for j \u2208 Z4\nand ai \u2208 A for i = 0, 1, . . . , p + q \u2212 1.\nLabel the vertices of Kp,q [C4 ] in the following way\n\u001a\n(2j, ai )\nfor j = 0, 1\ni\nf (xj ) =\n(1, 0) \u2212 f (xij\u22122 ) for j = 2, 3\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1.\nf (yjl )\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\n(2j, ap+l )\nfor j = 0, 1\nl\n(3, 0) \u2212 f (yj\u22122\n) for j = 2, 3\n\nfor l = 0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1.\nNotice that\nf (xi0 ) + f (xi2 ) = f (xi1 ) + f (xi3 ) = (1, 0),\nf (y0l ) + f (y2l ) = f (y1l ) + f (y3l ) = (3, 0),\nfor every i = 0, . . . , p \u2212 1 and for every l = 0, . . . , q \u2212 1. This implies:\n\u0011\nPp\u22121 \u0010P3\ni ) = p(2, 0) = (0, 0)\nf\n(x\nj\nj=0\ni=0\n\u0011\nPq\u22121 \u0010P3\nl\nf\n(y\n)\n= q(2, 0) = (2, 0)\nj\nj=0\nl=0\nHence for every x \u2208 V (Kp,q [C4 ]), w(x) = (3, 0).\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
