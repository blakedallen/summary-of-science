The US LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) has started observation with two 4-km arm detectors situated at Hanford,\nWashington, and Livingston, Louisiana; the Hanford detector also contains a 2-km interferometer. The Italian/French\nVIRGO project is commissioning a 3-km baseline instrument\nat Cascina, near Pisa. There are detectors being developed\nat Hannover (the German/British GEO project with a 600m baseline, which had its first test runs in 2002) and near\nPerth (the Australian International Gravitational Observatory, AIGO, initially with an 80-m baseline). A detector at\nTokyo (TAMA, 300-m baseline) has been in operation since\n2001. The astrophysical detection rates are expected to be\nlow for the current interferometers, such as 'Initial LIGO',\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: coward@physics.uwa.edu.au\n\nbut second-generation observatories with high optical power\nare in the early stages of development; these 'Advanced' interferometers have target sensitivities that are predicted to\nprovide a practical detection rate.\nDouble neutron star (DNS) binary mergers are potentially among the strongest GW sources and are a key search\ntarget for interferometric observatories (Thorne & Cutler\n2002). Eight close DNS binary systems are known to exist in the Galaxy as a subset of the observed radio binary pulsar population (Hulse & Taylor 1975; Wolszczan\n1991). Energy loss from GW emission (Taylor & Weisberg\n1989) causes an orbital in-spiral until the binary system\ncoalesces, resulting in a burst of GWs usually described\nas a 'chirp' signal. The discovery of the DNS binary systems containing PSRs J0737\u20133039 (Burgay et al. 2003) and\nJ1756\u22122251 (Faulkner et al. 2005) using the Parkes radio\ntelescope brings the number of known DNS systems in the\nGalactic disk to merge within the Hubble time to four; this\nexcludes the PSR B2127+11C system as it is in a globular\n\n\fD. M. Coward, M. Lilley, E. J. Howell, R. R. Burman and D. G. Blair\n\ncluster and probably not formed by binary evolution (see\nTable 1). With an orbital period of only 2.45 hr, the double pulsar system J0737\u20133039A,B will coalesce in only 87\nMyr, a factor of 3.5 shorter than the coalescence time of\nthe Hulse-Taylor PSR B1913+16 system, which yielded the\nfirst evidence for gravitational radiation. Predicted merger\nrates are dominated by the J0737\u20133039 system, because of\nits proximity, short coalescence time and the difficulty of its\ndiscovery (Faulkner et al. 2005). In contrast, PSR J1756\u2013\n2251's parameters are similar to those of previously known\npulsars; thus, its very recent addition isn't expected to significantly alter the predicted merger rate.\nIn order to estimate the DNS coalescence rate, Kalogera\net al. (2001) used a semi-empirical approach, based on the\nphysical properties of known DNS systems and pulsar survey\nselection effects, to obtain scale factors that correct for the\nunobserved fraction of existing systems. In an alternative\napproach, Kim et al. (2004) generated the probability distribution of merger rates using Monte Carlo simulations in\nwhich they populate a model galaxy with a specified number\nof NS binaries whose properties are those of known systems;\nthey also model survey selection effects to deduce detection\nrates and their statistical significance. With this model and\nmore up-to-date pulsar survey results that include J0737\u2013\n3039, Kalogera et al. (2004) presented updated bounds for\nthe coalescence rate for Galactic disk DNS systems, yield+209.1\ning RDNS = 83\u221266.1\nMyr\u22121 , and derived detection rates for\n+87.6\nInitial and Advanced LIGO of 34.8\u221227.7\n\u00d7 10\u22123 yr\u22121 and\n+470.5\n\u22121\n168.8\u2212148.7 \u00d7 yr respectively, factors 5\u20137 higher than previous estimates.\nOthers (Piran 1992; Ando 2004) assume a simple\nparametrization of merger rates with merger probability\nPm (t) \u221d t\u03b1 , where t is the time from formation of the\nbinary and \u03b1 is a constant; the distribution of mergers\nas a function of time is simply given by the convolution\nof the star formation rate with the distribution Pm (t).\nRegimbau et al. (2005), using numerical simulations, derive\na probability distribution for DNS merger time, \u03c4 , of the\nform P (\u03c4 ) = 0.087/\u03c4 , and find that mergers are possible\nbetween 2 \u00d7 105 yr and the age of the Universe. Using both\nevolutionary and statistical models, Regimbau et al. (2005)\nfind a Galactic merger rate of 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 yr\u22121 , similar to the\nlower bound calculated by Kalogera et al. (2004).\nA purely theoretical approach to estimate coalescence\nrates can be based on the predictions of population synthesis\nmodels that attempt to simulate the entire pulsar population\n(Lipunov et al. 1997; Belczynski et al. 2002). However, the\nsize of the parameter space and associated uncertainties involved seriously limit this way of inferring merger rates. For\ninstance, new theoretical models of merger formation can\nhave considerable impact: Recent simulations by Chaurasia\nand Bailes (2005) show that significant kick velocities imparted to neutron stars at birth give rise to highly eccentric\norbits resulting in accelerated orbital decay and greatly reduced lifetimes. Their work indicates that a non-negligible\nfraction of DNS systems could merge within times as short\nas 10 yrs. This implies that there could be a selection effect favouring the observation of those binary pulsar systems\nthat coalesce over relatively long times.\nOur interest is in the detection of a GW background\ngenerated by DNS merger events throughout the cosmos.\nAs a starting point, we adopt the Galactic coalescence rates\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\ndRDNS/dz (min\u22121)\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\u03c4=2 Gyr \u03c4=1 Gyr\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c4=0\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\u03c4=5 Gyr\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nredshift, z\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. The differential DNS merger rate as a function of redshift z using the lower Galactic rate of 17 Myr\u22121 from Kalogera\net al. (2004) and four merger times, \u03c4 = (0,1,2,5) Gyr, assumed\nthe same for all systems. The curves are calculated using the SFR\nevolution factor obtained from the parametrized model labelled\nSF2 in Porciani & Madau (2001) and a flat-\u039b cosmology with\n\u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, assuming a SFR cut-off at z = 5; the\ncut-off projects forward in time to the end points of the timedelayed curves. A time delay of 1\u20135 Gyr has minimal effect on\ndRDNS /dz at small z compared to the differential rate locked to\nthe evolving SFR.\n\nof Kalogera et al. (2004) as a basis for estimating the rate\ndensity in our local intergalactic neighbourhood. To project\nthis throughout the Universe, we assume that the DNS system formation rate follows the evolving star formation rate\n(SFR), for DNS systems with relatively short merger times\nof tens to hundreds of millions of years. In this way, we employ the updated Galactic DNS merger rate estimates as input to a model that describes the observer's evolving record\nof DNS mergers in terms of a 'probability event horizon'\n(PEH). We describe how the detectability of DNS mergers\nevolves with observation time.\nWe use the PEH concept (Coward & Burman 2005) to\ndescribe the cumulative GW signal from cosmic DNS mergers and show that the signal is dominated by the spatial and\ntemporal distribution of events. Instead of describing such\na signal as 'stochastic', we argue that the signal, although\ntemporally random, has a unique signature. We use the term\n'geometrical noise' to distinguish it from the stationary noise\nusually associated with a primordial GW stochastic background.\n\n2\n\nTHE COSMOLOGICAL PROBABILITY\nEVENT HORIZON\n\nIn the standard Friedmann cosmologies, one can express the\ndifferential DNS merger rate as the merger rate in the redshift shell z to z + dz:\ndRDNS =\n\ndV r0 e(z)\ndz ,\ndz 1 + z\n\n(1)\n\nwhere dV is the cosmology-dependent co-moving volume element and RDNS (z) is the all-sky (4\u03c0 solid angle) DNS merger\n\n\fThe gravitational wave 'probability event horizon' for double neutron star mergers\n\n3\n\nTable 1. DNS systems containing radio pulsars arranged in order of increasing estimated coalescence\ntime. The first entry is the double pulsar system; the second system is in a globular cluster (M 15);\nthe third is the Hulse-Taylor binary. Here, e is the orbital eccentricity, \u03c4c is the pulsar characteristic\nage and \u03c4GW is the time remaining to coalescence due to emission of gravitational radiation. The\nrelationship between a pulsar's characteristic and true ages is not clear, but we suppose the total\ncoalescence time from birth to be \u03c4c + \u03c4GW . Bold type indicates DNS systems that will coalesce in\nless than 1010 yr; the gobular-cluster system B2127+11C is excluded because its formation history is\nprobably different from those of the Galactic-disk systems: it is likely that this system has undergone\npartner exchange from close interactions.

Source rate density evolution is accounted for by\nthe dimensionless evolution factor e(z); this is normalized\nto unity in the present-epoch universe (z = 0) so r0 is the\nz = 0 rate density. The Galactic DNS merger rate is converted to a rate per unit volume, r0 , using the conversion\nfactor 10\u22122 from Ando (2004) for the number density of\ngalaxies in units of Mpc\u22123 . The (1 + z) factor accounts for\nthe time dilation of the observed rate by cosmic expansion,\nconverting a source-count equation to an event rate equation.\nWe assume a 'flat-\u039b' cosmology, in which the density\nparameters of matter and vacuum energy sum to unity;\nwe use \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 for their present-epoch\nvalues and take H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 for the Hubble\nparameter at z = 0. With the assumption that the DNS\nsystem formation rate follows the evolving star formation\nrate, e(z) is obtained by normalizing a SFR evolution model\nto its z = 0 value. Presently there is no consensus among\nastronomers on a model of star formation history at high\nz, so we shall use the parametrized model labelled SF2 of\nPorciani & Madau (2001) scaled to the flat-\u039b cosmology; see\nCoward & Burman (2005) for details.

In order to\ntest the sensitivity of dRDNS /dz to this delay, we have calculated it under the simplified assumption that all such\nevents are delayed by the same merger time \u03c4 .

The three delayed curves were obtained by converting\ne(z) to a function of cosmic time (or, equivalently, look-back\ntime), shifting it by \u03c4 and then converting back to a function\nof z. Cosmic time and z are related by the evolving Hubble parameter H(z), which can be expressed in terms of the\ncontributions of matter and vacuum energy (Peebles 1993):\nh(z) \u2261 H(z)/H0 = \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b\n\n\u0002\n\n\u00031/2\n\n(3)\n\nfor a flat-\u039b cosmology, and cosmic time is expressed by the\nformula:\nTcos (z) =\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n[(1 + z)h(z)]\u22121 dz .\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nFigure 1 shows that a 1\u20132 Gyr merger time does not\nsignificantly alter dRDNS /dz, especially for small z. Increasing \u03c4 has the effect of reducing the available volume for\nobserving DNS mergers and, for \u03c4 > 5 Gyr, coalescences are\nrestricted to the volume bounded by z \u2248 1. So, for systems\nsuch as those used by Kalogera et al. (2004) in their rate\nestimates, we can safely assume that they quite closely follow the evolving star formation rate. For definiteness, in the\nfollowing calculations, we assume that the DNS merger rate\napproximately follows the SFR evolution factor e(z).\nAs the DNS mergers throughout the Universe are independent of each other, their distribution is a Poisson process\nin time: the probability \u01eb for at least one event to occur in\na volume out to redshift z during observation time T at a\nmean rate RDNS (z) is given by an exponential distribution:\np(n > 1; RDNS (z), T ) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212RDNS (z)T = \u01eb ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith mean number of events N\u01eb \u2261 RDNS (z)T = |ln(1 \u2212 \u01eb)|.\nThe PEH is defined by the minimum distance, or redshift\nz\u01ebPEH , for at least one event to occur over some observation\ntime T , with probability above some selected threshold \u01eb. We\nfind z\u01ebPEH (T ) by fixing \u01eb and solving the above condition numerically, thus defining the PEH. In practice, we shall take\n\n\fTable 2.

For initial LIGO sensitivities,\nDNS mergers will be detectable in 22\u2013380 yrs of observation and,\nfor a \u03c1 \u223c 1, in 4\u201368 days. In the region below \u03c1 = 11.7, individual\nmergers are unlikely to be detected, but the cumulative signal\nwill manifest as 'geometrical noise' in interferometric data.\n\na 95% probability. For initial LIGO sensitivities, events with\nthe same \u03c1 will be detectable at a rate of one per 22\u2013380 yr\nand for \u03c1 \u223c 1, one every 4\u201368 days. Although DNS mergers\nwith \u03c1 . 11.7 will be present in the data, they are unlikely\nto be temporally resolved.\nHere, we consider a signal comprised of an ensemble of\nchirp signals that result from the final mergers of cosmo-\n\n\flogical DNSs. Even though the individual signals will not\noverlap, the cumulative background is stochastic because\none cannot predict with certainty the exact temporal evolution of the signal. But, the GW amplitude distribution\nwill be very different from a continuous astrophysical GW\nbackground. For a signal that consists of a sum of many\ncontinuously emitting, randomly distributed sources, such\nas the GW signal from the Galactic population of white\ndwarf-white dwarf or white dwarf-NS binaries, the central\nlimit theorem predicts that the GW amplitude distribution\nwill be Gaussian. The term 'confusion noise' is often used\nto describe the signal from the Galactic population of white\ndwarf-white dwarf binaries. In contrast, the GW background\nfrom DNS mergers has a non-Gaussian signature that is\ncharacterized by the spatial distribution of the sources, so\nwe use the term geometrical noise to describe it.\n\n4\n\nTHE PEH TECHNIQUE APPLIED TO\nSIMULATED DATA\n\nCoward, Burman & Blair (2002a,b) developed a procedure\nto simulate time series of the GW signals from supernovae\noccurring throughout the Universe. The method has provided a tool to probe the statistical signature of cosmological\n'standard candle' GW sources that follow the evolving star\nformation rate. In its simplest form, the simulation outputs a\ndistribution of events in redshift as a function of observation\ntime. Here, we use this procedure to extract the PEH signature from a distribution of observer-source distances and\nobservation times. The PEH technique is a procedure that\nrecords the time and distance of successively closer events,\n(ti , ri ), that satisfy the condition ri+1 < ri : each event in the\nPEH time series occurs at a shorter distance than the preceding one. A key feature of the procedure is that it probes\nthe rate of an observer's penetration into the small probability 'tail' of an event distribution.\nCoward & Burman (2005) applied this technique to the\nobserved gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift and observationtime distribution and found that it can be used to set limits\non the local rate density of GRBs. Because it is sensitive\nto the distribution of events in the small probability tail, in\nthis case corresponding to smaller volumes, the procedure\n'tracks' the temporal evolution of close events as detected\nby an observer. If a time series is comprised of more than\none class of event, then the PEH technique can identify these\ndistributions based on the distribution of PEH data. This\nwas shown by Coward & Burman (2005), where the PEH\nmodel fitted to the data indicated that the anomalously close\nGRB 980245 probably does not belong to the 'classical' GRB\npopulation.\nAs a further proof of concept, we apply the PEH technique to a distribution of GW amplitudes from a simulated distribution of DNS mergers throughout the Universe.\nWe use a DNS dimensionless characteristic GW amplitude\nhc = 4\u00d710\u221221 at 20 Mpc (Schutz 1991) and a non-redshifted\ncharacteristic frequency fc = 200 Hz. The results are plotted\nin figure 4. The 5% and 95% PEH curves are shown along\nwith the output from the PEH simulation shown as data\npoints. The 5% PEH curve is interpreted as the 'null PEH',\nas there is a 95% probability that no events will be observed\nat an amplitude above this threshold.\n\nrunning maximum amplitude\n\nThe gravitational wave 'probability event horizon' for double neutron star mergers\n\n5\n\n5% and 95% PEHs for\nDNS inspiral and merger\n5% and 95% Gaussian\u2212noise\nPEHs for Adv LIGO\nat 200 Hz\n\n\u221221\n\n10\n\n\u221222\n\n10\n\nGW model:\u221221\nhc = 4 \u00d7 10\nat 20 Mpc\nassuming 100 cycles at fc = 200 Hz\n\n\u221223\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nobservation time (days)\nFigure 4. The PEH technique applied to a distribution of GW\namplitudes from simulated DNS mergers throughout the Universe assuming the upper Galactic rate limit of 292 Myr\u22121 from\nKalogera et al. (2004). We use a DNS characteristic GW amplitude hc = 4\u00d710\u221221 at 20 Mpc (Schutz 1991) and a non-redshifted\ncharacteristic frequency fc = 200 Hz. The 5% (or 95% probability\nof no events occurring) and 95% PEH curves for DNS mergers are\nshown, along with the output of the PEH simulation applied to\na distribution of characteristic GW amplitudes modelled on DNS\nmergers, shown as filled circles. Also shown are the 5% and 95%\n'Gaussian-noise PEHs', modelled on idealized interferometric detector noise\u2013see text for details. The figure shows that the DNS\nmerger PEHs evolve much faster than the Gaussian-noise PEHs.\n\nIn order to develop the PEH concept into a technique\nfor GW data analysis, we need to incorporate a method for\ntreating detector noise. For 'standard candle' sources, this\ncan be done by working in terms of progressively increasing\namplitudes rather than progressively decreasing redshifts,\nas shown in figure 5. Noise transients of varying amplitudes\nmimic sources at varying redshifts, enabling the introduction of a 'noise PEH'. Here we use a 'Gaussian-noise PEH';\nthis is based on a standard zero-meanpGaussian distribution\nwith standard deviation sd = hrms fs /2fc , modelled on\nidealized interferometric detector noise with hrms denoting\nthe root-mean-square amplitude of the noise and fs the sampling frequency\u2013see Arnaud et al. (2003). Figure 5 shows the\n5% and 95% Gaussian-noise PEHs.\nIt is clear from the small gradient of the Gaussian-noise\nPEH curves that the temporal evolution of transients, originating from the tail of the distribution is slow. The striking\nfeature of this figure is the gradient of the PEH curves for\nthe source amplitude distribution: it is much bigger than for\nthe Gaussian-noise case, because of the distance-amplitude\nrelation. We define this type of PEH data as 'geometrical',\nbecause it is linked to the spatial distribution of sources.\nWe note that although we have incorporated SFR evolution and a cosmological model to calculate the DNS merger\nrate at high z, the PEH will be most sensitive to events that\nare comparable to or greater than the detection threshold\nof the detector. For Advanced LIGO, this will be of order\nseveral hundred Mpc (z \u2248 0.05), implying that the PEH\nwill be dominated by sources in the local Universe where\ncosmological effects are minor.\nGiven that a geometrical signature is present in a time\nseries, one can fit a PEH model to the data, with the local\n\n\f6\n\nD. M. Coward, M. Lilley, E. J. Howell, R. R. Burman and D. G. Blair\n\nrate density as a free parameter. In the presence of noise, this\nsignature will be modified, but if the detector noise is well\ncharacterized, a fitting function constructed from the sum\nof both noise and geometrical distributions can be used. For\nsmall signal-noise ratios, the noise will dominate the PEH\ndata for short observation times. But as observation time increases, the geometrical signature will grow at a faster rate\nthan the noise. It is possible that the GW signal from DNS\nmergers can be identified before that of a single merger,\noccurring above the detector threshold, as shown in figure\n3. We propose that there exists an intermediate detection\nregime, with pre-filtered signal-noise-ratio of less than unity,\nwhere the DNS merger rate is high enough that the geometrical signature could be identified in interferometer data.\nThis type of search provides an opportunity to set upper\nlimits on the DNS merger rate.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe cumulative signal from transient GW sources at cosmological distances is commonly described as a stochastic\nbackground because of the temporal randomness of the individual events. But we have shown here that, for a cosmic population of DNS mergers, the GW cumulative signal\nwill be dominated by the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the sources. We use the term 'geometrical'\nnoise, because the GW amplitude distribution composed of\nDNS mergers is dominated by the spatial distribution of the\nsources.\nInterestingly, geometrical noise from cosmic DNS mergers (and similar transient GW sources) is linked to the sensitivity of the detector and the cumulative event rate. If a GW\ndetector could probe DNS mergers to distances corresponding to the time when they first occurred in the Universe, the\ndetector could potentially resolve all events and there would\nbe no geometrical noise from unresolved signals. However,\nif the cumulative rate measured in our frame were to be so\nhigh that the individual chirps would overlap, corresponding to a signal of duty cycle greater than unity, then the\nresulting signals would manifest as geometrical noise. This\nis unlikely for DNS mergers: the individual events are not\nexpected to overlap but to be nonetheless not individually\ndetectable because of the small signal-to-noise ratio.\nWe highlight the concept that the detectability of a GW\nstochastic background from DNS mergers throughout the\nUniverse and of individual DNS mergers is linked to the observer via the instrument duty cycle, the cumulative event\nrate and the sensitivity of the detector. The PEH model is\napplied above to the detectability of DNS mergers with Advanced and Initial LIGO; it shows the temporal evolution of\nthe GW signal from many faint unresolved events converging to detectable single events of high signal-to-noise ratio.\nDetection strategies based on the PEH model could utilize\nthe geometrical signature of the temporal evolution of the\nchirp GW amplitude distribution. We plan to investigate the\nPEH technique further using simulated GW background and\nnon-Gaussian noise data.\nThe PEH method could also be used to set constraints\non the black hole-black hole (BH-BH) merger rate, which\nis presently highly uncertain. Although occurring at a lower\nintrinsic rate than DNS mergers, the GW emission from BH-\n\nBH mergers is expected to be significantly higher, implying an enhanced detection rate because of the larger detection volume. Estimates range from 30\u20134000 yr\u22121 assuming\na BH mass of 10 M\u2299 and a detection horizon of z = 0.4\n(Thorne & Cutler 2002) for Advanced LIGO sensitivity. We\nplan to use the BH-BH mass and merger rate distributions\nto determine if a PEH model could be developed and applied to interferometer data to set limits on the rate and\nmass distributions.\nAlthough we have shown how the cumulative GW signal\nfrom DNS mergers should manifest in a time series, we have\nnot yet tested how robust the above procedure is to the\nnon-stationarity of the data. For instance, if a time series is\nplagued with non-Gaussian transients, then the effectiveness\nof the fitting procedure will be reduced, unless a good model\nfor the transients is available.\nWe assume optimal (matched) filtering can be applied\nto the candidate transients, but the filters that will be most\neffective will not be exactly matched to individual events.\nThe 'norm' and 'mean' filters, although not optimal, should\nperform at a significant fraction of a matched filter for\ntransients where the signal is not completely characterized\n(Arnaud et al. 2003). We emphasize that using the PEH in a\nsignal processing context is based on fitting to outliers using\na model distribution and not 'detecting' individual events.\nNonetheless, it is important to filter the data to select as\nmany transients that are candidates for DNS mergers as\npossible. As a test of the robustness of the procedure using\ndifferent filters, we plan to inject simulated cosmologically\ndistributed GW transients into non-Gaussian noise.\nWe note that the simulated GW amplitude distribution\nwill be modified by the detector antenna pattern, which we\nhave not included in our simulations, where we used the\nmean value. In applying a PEH model to real data, account\nmust be taken of the modulation and distortion of the signal\nby detector characteristics and by both detector and environmental noise. We plan to extend the current simulations\nby incorporating such effects as part of a program to test\nthe sensitivity of the PEH fitting procedure.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nD. M.
