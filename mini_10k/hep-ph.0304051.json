The most celebrated one is mb = m\u03c4 at\nthe unification scale 3 , which is corroborated by experiment once the running\nis taken into account. This would have been a great success if not for the fact\nthat the analog relations fail badly for the second and especially for the first\nfamily.\nAnother novel feature of supersymmetric unification is the new source of\nproton decay through dimension five operators 4, generated by the superheavy\nfermionic fields. This operators originate in Yukawa couplings and are thus\nintimately correlated with the fermionic mass and mixing angle relations. In\nthis talk, we review in some detail this issue in the context of the minimal SU(5)\nand SO(10) supersymmetric GUTs. We will argue that the minimal SU(5)\na Invited\n\ntalk at \" 20 years of SUGRA\", Boston, March 2003.\n\n1\n\n\ftheory is still in perfect accord with data. However, the non-zero neutrino\nmasses and the almost perfect conservation of R-parity point naturally toward\nits SO(10) extension. We will briefly recall the essential features of SO(10)\ngrand unification. We emphasize the attractive feature of R-parity remaining\nan exact symmetry to all orders in perturbation theory in the minimal model\nwith a renormalizable see-saw mechanism. We also discuss some interesting\nnew results on fermion masses such as the deep connection between b \u2212 \u03c4\nunification and the large atmospheric neutrino mixing. We conclude with\nSO(10) being a complete and realistic model of both unification and fermion\nmasses and mixings.\n2\n\nThe minimal supersymmetric SU(5)\n\nWe define the minimal SU(5) supersymmetric theory in the conventional manner, that is, with three generations of fermion superfields and a 24 adjoint (\u03a3)\nand 5 (\u03a6) and 5\u0304 (\u03a6\u0304) Higgs superfields. This implies the well-known relations\nmD = mE generation by generation, as we mentioned above. Of course, this\nmust be corrected for the first two generations and in the context of the minimal model this simply implies the existence of higher-dimensional operators\ncut-off by the Planck scale. Hereafter, by minimal SU(5) we will mean such a\ntheory, where the higher-dimensional operators are taken into account. Notice\nthat this is very similar to the neutrino mass issue in the Standard Model. The\nnonvanishing neutrino mass does not mean that the Standard Model is ruled\nout, but simply points out to the existence of higher-dimensional operators.\nAs mentioned above, supersymmetric GUTs in general, and the SU(5)\ntheory in particular, lead to quite fast proton decay through d=5 operators\ngenerated by the superheavy colored triplet Higgs supermultiplet (T and T\u0304 )\nwith masses mT \u2243 MGUT . An important question in recent years was whether\nthe minimal supersymmetric SU(5) theory is already ruled out on this basis,\nespecially after it was found out that the RRRR operators play a crucial role\n5\n(in the context of SO(10) this was shown before in 6 ), and it was finally\nargued that this was indeed true 7 . We will see however that the uncertainty in\nthe masses of the supermultiplets in \u03a3, the lack of knowledge of sfermion and\nfermion masses and mixings, and the presence of higher-dimensional operators\nis sufficient to keep SU(5) still in accord with experiment.\nLet us discuss these points carefully:\n2.1\n\nDetermination of MGUT and mT\n\nThe superpotential for the heavy sector is (up to terms 1/MP l )\n2\n\n\fW = mT r\u03a32 + \u03bbT r\u03a33 + a\n\n(T r\u03a32 )2\nT r\u03a34\n+b\n.\nMP l\nMP l\n\n(1)\n\nOf course, if \u03bb \u2248 O(1), we ignore higher-dimensional terms. However, in\nsupersymmetry \u03bb is a Yukawa-type coupling, i.e. self-renormalizable. For small\n\u03bb (\u03bb \u226a MGUT /MP l ), the opposite becomes true and a and b terms dominate.\nIn this case, it is a simple exercise to show that\nm3 = 4m8 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m3 and m8 are the masses of the weak triplet and color octet in \u03a3.\nIn the renormalizable case m3 = m8 . The RGE at one loop for the gauge\ncouplings are readily solved to give:\nmT\nMGUT\n\n\u0012\n\nm3\nm8\n\u0012\n\n=\n\nm0T\n\n=\n\n0\nMGUT\n\n\u00135/2\n\n,\n\n0\nMGUT\n2m8\n\n(3)\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the superscript 0 denotes the values in the case m3 = m8 . Since when\n2\n(2) is valid, m8 \u2248 MGUT\n/MP l , we can also write\nMGUT \u2248\n\nh\n\n0\nMGUT\n\n\u00013\n\nMP l\n\ni1/4\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nFrom (2) we get\n0\nmT = 32m0T , MGUT \u2248 10MGUT\n.\n\n(6)\n\n0\nNow, MGUT\n\u2248 1016 GeV and it was shown last year 7 that mT > 7 \u00d7 1016\nGeV is sufficiently large to be in accord with the newest data on proton decay.\nOn the other hand, since 7\n\nm0T < 3 \u00d7 1015 GeV ,\n\n(7)\n\nfrom (6) we see that m3 = 4m8 is enough to save the theory. Obviously, an\nimprovement of the measurement of \u03c4p is badly needed. It is noteworthy that in\nthis case the usual d = 6 proton decay becomes out of reach: \u03c4p (d = 6) > 1038\nyrs.\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nHigher dimensional operators and fermion masses and mixings\n\nIn the minimal SU(5) theory at the renormalizable level we have the Yukawa\ncoupling relations at MGUT\nYU = YUT ,\n\nYE = YD ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere in the supersymmetric standard model language the Yukawa sector can\nbe written as\nWY =\n+\n\nHQT YU uc + H\u0304QT YD dc + H\u0304ecT YE L\n1\nT QT AQ + T ucT Bec + T\u0304 QT CL + T\u0304 ucT Ddc .\n2\n\n(9)\n\nAlso, in the minimal renormalizable model (at MGUT )\nA = B = YU = YUT , C = D = YD = YE .\n\n(10)\n\nThe fact that A = B = YU , C = YE , D = YD , is simply a statement of\nSU(5) symmetry. On the other hand YU = YUT and YD = YE result from the\nSU(4)c Pati-Salam (PS) 8 like symmetry left unbroken by hHi and hH\u0304i. Under\nthis symmetry dc \u2194 e, u \u2194 uc , d \u2194 ec . It is the above relations that cause\nthe problem, since the color triplet couplings are then well-defined.\n4\nOf course, this symmetry is broken by h\u03a3\u03b1\n\u03b1 i 6= h\u03a34 i, where \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3; this\nbecomes relevant when we include higher dimensional operators suppressed by\nh\u03a3i/MP l , such as\n1\n\u03a6\u0304 \u03a3 10f 5\u0304f\n(11)\nMP l\nwhere 10f and 5\u0304f stand for the fermion multiplets. Since there are now neither\nSU(5) nor SU(4)c (PS) symmetries, it is a simple exercise to show that the\nfermion mass relations now become consistent. For a careful study of proton\ndecay in this context see 9,10 , where it is shown that this by itself is enough to\nsave the theory.\n2.3\n\nSfermion and fermion masses and mixings and proton lifetime\n\nAs we said, d=5 proton decay is generated through Yukawa couplings and thus\nfermion and sfermion masses and mixings play an important role. We shall not\ndiscuss this in detail here, since we know nothing about the sfermion properties;\nthis issue belongs to the realm of supersymmetry breaking and is orthogonal\nto grand unification. It is highly model-dependent, however the constraints\nfrom FCNC can be useful in restricting the proton decay predictions. It has\nbeen discussed extensively in 9,11 and we refer the reader to these works.\n4\n\n\fIn short, the minimal SU(5) supersymmetric theory, although in accord\nwith experiment is highly constrained and thus potentially falsifiable. It is the\nbest, most predictable theory of proton decay, and in our opinion care should\nbe taken before we can proclaim it dead. Certainly, and order of magnitude or\ntwo of improvement in proton lifetime measurements is more than welcome.\n3\n\nSupersymmetric SO(10) theory\n\nSO(10) grand unified theory is an appealing candidate for the unification of\nquarks and leptons (family by family) and their interactions for a number of\nreasons:\n1. a family of fermions, included the right handed neutrino, fits into a single\nspinorial representation\n2. it offers a natural explanation of the smallness of neutrino mass through\nthe see-saw mechanism 12\n3. as any theory of see-saw mechanism, it incorporates leptogenesis, a simple\nand appealing mechanism for generating the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse 13\n4. left-right symmetry in the form of charge conjugation is a finite gauge\ntransformation, which allows for spontaneous parity violation in the context of Left-Right models 8,14\n5. it contains the Pati-Salam 8 subgroup which is the prototype of quarklepton unification; it is this symmetry that leads to the above discussed\nrelation mD = mE .\n6. matter parity, which is equivalent to R parity, is also a finite gauge transformation; furthermore, it remains exact after all the symmetry breaking\nhas taken place 15,16\n7. in the minimal renormalizable see-saw scenario, it can be shown that\nSO(10) is a realistic theory of fermion masses and mixings; it correlates\nb \u2212 \u03c4 unification with a large atmospheric neutrino mixing 19 (see also\n20\n) and it predicts the element 1 \u2212 3 of the leptonic mixing matrix to be\nclose to the experimental limit 21\nWe will now discuss the last two issues in some detail.\n5\n\n\f3.1\n\nSO(10) and R-parity\n\nIt is convenient to work with matter parity defined as M = (\u22121)3(B\u2212L) instead\nof its equivalent analog R-parity, R = M (\u22121)2S , since M commutes with\nsupersymmetry. In SO(10), under M\nM\n\nM\n\n16 \u2212\u2192 \u221216 ,\n\n10 \u2212\u2192 10 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is equal to C 2 , where C is the center of SO(10). Of course, the crucial\nthing is the gauging of B \u2212L 22 . Assume next that one utilizes 126-dimensional\nrepresentation in order to break B \u2212 L symmetry and give a mass to the righthanded neutrino, just as in the original proposal. This allows us to stick to\nthe renormalizable theory and simultaneously to keep R-parity intact. The\nalternative, to use a 16-dimensional multiplet 23 in order to break B \u2212 L,\nbreaks R-parity at the GUT scale, and the theory must thus be augmented by\nextra discrete symmetries in order to keep the proton stable. This would take\nus beyond the SO(10) theory which we pursue here.\nThis however is not sufficient. Both right-handed and left-handed sneutrino fields can in principle get nonvanishing VEVs and break R-parity. As far\nas the right-handed sneutrino is concerned, it is a simple exercise to show that\nthe group structure does not allow it 15 . Since its mass is equal to the mass of\nthe right-handed neutrino, and thus very large (close to GUT scale), this fact\nsurvives a tiny supersymmetry breaking.\nThe situation with the left-handed neutrino is far more complex. It belongs\nto the light sector of the theory and a priori it could be tachyonic to start with,\nand thus get a VEV. To see that this does not happen requires a subtle interplay\nbetween cosmology, phenomenology and the decoupling theorem. First of all,\nrecall that the left-handed sneutrino cannot be a tachyon in the MSSM with\nR-parity. This we know from the Z-decay width; namely, the opposite would\nresult in the existence of a Goldstone boson, the Majoron (J), and the Z-boson\nwould decay into a Majoron and its real counterpart (RJ ). The mass of RJ\nis of the order of the sneutrino VEV, and this VEV must be small in order\nfor the Majoron not to get overproduced in stars 24 and/or for the induced\nneutrino mass to be small enough. Therefore the left-handed sneutrino VEV\nwould produce a Z decay width incompatible with observations.\nA simple application of the decoupling theorem ensures that the same\nhappens in SO(10) theory. In this case a would-have-been Majoron of course\ngets a mass, but this mass must vanish in the limit of large MR , the scale of\nB \u2212 L breaking. More precisely, one shows that 15\nmJ \u2243\n6\n\nm23/2\nMR\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhere m3/2 is the scale of low-energy supersymmetry breaking. Obviously\nmJ \u226a MZ , and the above reasoning follows through. Remarkably enough,\nR-parity can be not broken at all in SO(10), independently of the mechanism\nof supersymmetry breaking 16 .\nThis important fact holds true for any renormalizable theory of the supersymmetric see-saw mechanism based on spontaneous breaking of B \u2212 L\n15,16,25\n. This not only guarantees a stable enough proton, but also a stable\nLSP (lightest supersymmetric particle), probably the most natural candidate\nfor the dark matter of the Universe.\n3.2\n\nSO(10) and fermion masses and mixings\n\nThe minimal SO(10) theory, by definition, contains a single 10-dimensional\nHiggs supermultiplet coupled to fermions. At first glance, in the usual manner,\nthis should imply mD = mE as stressed repeatedly. Namely, the Higgs that\ntakes the VEV is a bi-doublet (2,2,1) under the Pati-Salam group SU (2)L \u00d7\nSU (2)R \u00d7 SU (4)c . However, the 126 representation needed for the see-saw\nmechanism contains also a (2,2,15) field, and in general this field gets a VEV\n26\n. In the supersymmetric theory, this amounts to using a 210 Higgs multiplet\nat the GUT scale. This has a number of interesting features and should be\npursued and studied more carefully.\nFor us, it is sufficient to have a (2,2,15) with a VEV. This simple fact,\nsurprisingly enough, renders the theory completely realistic as we shall see.\nOn top of that it offers a natural connection between the large \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 mixing\nand b \u2212 \u03c4 unification. This provides a badly needed answer as to why the small\nquark mixing angle(s) should be accompanied by large leptonic mixing(s). Let\nus see how this comes about.\nFirst of all, let us recall an important fact in the SO(10) see-saw mechanism. The Yukawa couplings are given by\nLY = 10H \u03c8Y10 \u03c8 + 126H \u03c8Y126 \u03c8 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c8 stands for the 16 dimensional spinors which incorporate a family of\nfermions, and Y10 and Y126 are the Yukawa coupling matrices in generation\nspace.\nFrom\n126H = (3, 1, 10) + (1, 3, 10) + (2, 2, 15) + (1, 1, 6)\n(15)\none has\nM\u03bdR = Y126 h(1, 3, 10)126 i ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere h(1, 3, 10)126 i = MR , the scale of SU(2)R gauge symmetry breaking.\n7\n\n\fIt can be shown that, after the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) breaking through h10H i =\nh(2, 2, 1)i \u2248 MW , the (3, 1, 10) multiplet from 126H gets a small vev 27,28\nh(3, 1, 10)126 i \u221d\n\n2\nMW\n,\nMP\n\n(17)\n\nwhere MP is the scale of the breakdown of parity. In turn, neutrinos pick up\nsmall masses\nmD ,\n(18)\nM\u03bdL = Y126 h(3, 1, 10)126 i + mTD M\u03bd\u22121\nR\nwhere mD is the neutrino Dirac mass matrix. It is often assumed, for no reason\nwhatsoever, that the second term dominates. This is the so-called type I (or\ncanonical) see-saw 17. In what follows we explore the opposite case,type II (or\nnon-canonical) see-saw. After all, it does not involve Dirac mass terms and\nso there is no reason a priori in this case to expect quark-lepton analogy of\nmixing angles. In this sense the type II see-saw is physically more appealing.\nMore than that, we will show that the large leptonic mixing fits perfectly with\nthe small quark mixing, as long as mb = m\u03c4 .\nTo see this, notice that fermion masses take the following form\nMU\nMD\n\nu\nu\n= Y10 v10\n+ Y126 v126\n,\nd\nd\n= Y10 v10\n+ Y126 v126\n,\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nME\nMN\n\nd\nd\n,\n\u2212 3Y126 v126\n= Y10 v10\n= Y126 h(3, 1, 10)126 i ,\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nwhere U , D, E, N stand for up quark, down quark, charged lepton and neuu,d\nu,d\nare the two vevs of (2, 2, 1) in 10H and\nand v126\ntrino, respectively, while v10\n(2, 2, 15) in 126H , and the last formula is the assumption of the type II see-saw.\nThe result is surprisingly simple. Notice that 18\nMN \u221d Y126 \u221d MD \u2212 ME .\n\n(23)\n\nNow, let us study the 2nd and 3rd generations, and work in the basis of\nME diagonal. The puzzle then is: why a small mixing in MD corresponds to a\nlarge mixing in MN ? For simplicity take the mixing in MD to vanish, \u03b8D = 0,\nand ignore the second generation masses, i.e. take ms = m\u03bc = 0. Then\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n0\n.\n(24)\nMN \u221d\n0 mb \u2212 m\u03c4\nObviously, unless mb = m\u03c4 , neutrino mixing vanishes. Thus, large mixing in\nMN (the physical leptonic mixing in the above basis) is deeply connected with\n8\n\n\fthe b \u2212 \u03c4 unification. Notice that we have done no model building whatsoever;\nwe only assumed a renormalizable SO(10) theory and the type II see-saw.\nOf course, this is only very qualitative; for a more careful analysis, one\nneeds to switch on m\u03bc , ms and the mixings. This has been done in detail in 19 ,\nand we refer the reader there, suffices it to say that the precise computations\nconfirm the above qualitative analysis.\nThis is all nice, you may say, but what about three generations? The\nanalysis has just been performed 21 , and it will be reported in the talk by Rabi\nMohapatra in this conference. We only cite here the crucial prediction of the\ntheory: the 1-3 leptonic mixing is as large as the experiments allows, making\nthe theory all the more interesting.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn these talk, we have focused on some of the central issues in supersymmetric\ngrand unification: the predictions for proton decay and its natural connection\nwith fermion masses and mixings. We started off by showing that the minimal\nsupersymmetric SU(5) theory, although still alive, is tightly constrained and\ncan and should be tested by improved proton decay experiments.\nTo us, however, SO(10) appears a more complete and more appealing\ntheory. First of all, it succeeds where the MSSM and SU(5) fail, that is, in\ndetermining the low energy effective theory. We now know that in the context\nof SO(10), at least with a renormalizable see-saw mechanism, R-parity can\nnever be broken and neutralinos ought to be some or all of the dark matter\nof the universe. It is reassuring that the same theory provides a complete and\nconsistent description of all fermion masses and mixings. Most important, if\nyou stick to the type II see-saw the b \u2212 \u03c4 unification says simply and clearly\nthat the small quark u \u2212 b mixing must be accompanied by a large atmospheric\nneutrino mixing. Last but not least, it seems that the 1-3 neutrino mixing will\nprovide a crucial test of the theory in the near future.\nIn spite of the apparent success, a lot remains to be done. The most\nurgent and most important task is a careful study of proton decay. Namely, the\npossible existence of intermediate scales in SO(10) lowers the unification scale,\nand thus the proton lifetime. This is more than welcome for d=6 operators\nmediated proton decay, since it makes it accessible to experiment. However\ndimension 5 operators run the risk of leading to a too fast decay. We have seen\nthat in SU(5) they are safe, but only marginally.\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe are deeply grateful to our collaborators Charanjit Aulakh, Pavel FileviezP\u00e9rez, Andrija Ra\u0161in and Francesco \"Paco\" Vissani.\n1.
