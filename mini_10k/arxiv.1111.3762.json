Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands\n(Dated: October 29, 2018)\nA drop impacting on a solid surface deforms before the liquid makes contact with the surface. We\ndirectly measure the time evolution of the air layer profile under the droplet using high-speed color\ninterferometry, obtaining the air layer thickness before and during the wetting process. Based on\nthe time evolution of the extracted profiles obtained at multiple times, we measure the velocity of\nair exiting from the gap between the liquid and the solid, and account for the wetting mechanism\nand bubble entrapment. The present work offers a tool to accurately measure the air layer profile\nand quantitatively study the impact dynamics at a short time scale before impact.\n\nDrop impact on solid surfaces, beside its inherent\nbeauty, has been playing an increasingly important role\nin industrial processes as diverse as ink-jet printing, spray\ncooling, and spray coating. Since it was first studied in\n1876 by Worthington [1], the phenomenon has received\ntremendous attention from researchers, yet our understanding of this subject is still far from being complete\n(see review article [2]). A challenge in studying this problem arises from widely different time and spatial scales\nof the involved effects. Another difficulty comes from determining relevant physical parameters that govern the\nimpact dynamics. For example, beside apparent parameters such as the surface roughness and wettability, the\nliquid viscosity, surface tension, and density, it was recently discovered that the ambient pressure is also a crucial parameter as it dictates the splash threshold after\nimpact [3]. This finding and subsequent studies [4, 5]\nsuggest that the air layer between an impinging droplet\nand a solid surface may have significant effects on the\nimpact's outcomes. Hence, it is essential to understand\nhow the drop and the surface interact through the air\nlayer.\nOn the theoretical side, a mechanism of splash formation focusing on the short time scale within which the\ndrop starts being deformed has been proposed [6, 7]. Detailed analysis and simulations have been subsequently\ndeveloped [8, 9]. On the experimental side, the dynamics\nof droplet impact at the earliest time scale have also been\nstudied; one of the most remarkable phenomena is the\ndetection of entrapped bubbles under an impacting drop\n[10\u201313]. The existence of these bubbles indicates that\nthe drop's bottom surface is deformed before it makes\ncontact with the surface. There is, however, a lack of\ndetailed measurements of the air layer thickness at the\nearliest time of impact, as well as the formation of the\nentrapped bubbles.\nHere we report the first direct measurement of the\nevolution of the air layer profile between an impinging\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nt.tran@utwente.nl\nd.lohse@utwente.nl\nc.sun@utwente.nl\n\ndroplet and a solid surface using high-speed color interferometry. We focus on the earliest time of impact when\nthe liquid has not touched the surface but starts being\ndeformed due to the pressure increase in the air layer between the liquid and the solid surface. We measure the\nair flow between the droplet and the solid surface, and\ninvestigate the mechanism of bubble entrapment.\nz\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nWater\ndroplet\nhe\nGlass\n\ng\n\nx\n\nNeedle\n\n(c)\nGlass slide\n5x objective\nLong\ndistance\nmicroscope\n\nLight\nColor\nHS\ncamera\n\n1 mm\n\nFIG. 1.

We generate liquid drops\nby using a syringe pump to push liquid out of a fine\nneedle.

The\ndrop typically has diameter D \u2248 2 mm and its velocity\nbefore impacting the surface can be adjusted by varying the needle's height H. We capture the drop impact\nfrom the bottom with a color high-speed camera (SA2,\nPhotron Inc.) connected to a long working-distance microscope (Navitar Inc.) and a 5X objective. The field of\nview achieved by this combination is 2 mm. We illuminate the impact area from below by supplying white light\nfrom a high-intensity fibre lamp (Olympus ILP-1) to the\nmicroscope's coaxial light port. When a drop approaches\nthe glass slide, a thin film of air is formed between the\nliquid and solid surfaces before wetting occurs. Light of\nthe same wavelength coming from the bottom, upon reflection from both surfaces of the film (Fig. 1b) forms\ninterference patterns recorded by the camera. Each one\nof these patterns consists of constructive (bright) and destructive (dark) fringes; the fringe spacing depends on the\nair layer thickness and the wavelength of incident light.\nSince the lamp emits light of multiple wavelengths, the\nsuperposition of all available patterns produces concentric rings of rainbow colors as shown in Fig. 1c.\nIn most of our experiments, we set the camera's frame\nrate to 10000 frame per second (fps), and its resolution to\n512 \u00d7 512 pixels to capture droplets with impact velocity\nless than 0.5 m/s. In the case that the impact velocity is\nhigher, the frame rate can be set as high as 86400 fps at\nresolution 32\u00d7256 pixels to capture the impact dynamics.\nIn order to extract the absolute thickness of the air\nlayer between an impinging drop and a glass surface, we\nconstruct a set of reference colors that can be related to\nabsolute thickness. We put a convex lens on top of the\nglass slide (see inset in Fig. 2b) and observe the interference rings caused by the air film between two surfaces.\nSince the pattern consists of concentric rings of different colors, and the air film thickness is known at each\nradial location, each color along a line passing through\nthe center of these rings is associated with a thickness\nvalue. In Fig. 2b, we show the air thickness profile between the lens and the glass slide.

Note the extremely\ndifferent length scales at the x\u2212axis (mm) and hr \u2212axis (\u03bcm)\nin (b) and (d).\n\ndue to change in air thickness is obtained by taking a\nthin radial strip of 100 \u00d7 2200 pixels from an image of\nan interference pattern and then averaging colors in the\ntransverse direction to reduce noise. The resulting strip\n(Fig. 2a), which has no color variation in the transverse\ndirection, contains N = 2200 pixels in the x\u2212direction\nand hence N reference colors that can be used for calibration. Since the camera uses the sRGB model to represent\ncolors, the color of each pixel i is represented by a color\nvector (Ri , Gi , Bi ). The pixel's coordinate is xi , which is\nrelated to a value of thickness hir . Thus, we have a set of\nreference colors (Ri , Gi , Bi ) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , each of which\nis associated with a reference thickness hir . The reference\nthickness range is 0 \u2264 hir \u2264 4 \u03bcm. The thickness-color\nrelation is shown in Fig. 2c.\nThe sRGB model, however, is generally not preferred\nwhen comparing colors between experiments because it\ndoes not decouple light intensity and color information,\nwhich poses a problem due to variations in illumination\nconditions such as light intensity, incident and observing\nangles. Instead, we use the CIE 1976 color model (also\ncalled CIELAB), a model that is most effective in decoupling light intensity ([14]) (see the Supplemental material\nfor details). A color in CIELAB model has three components: L for lightness information, and a and b for color\ninformation. Thus, we can separate light intensity from\nour analysis by omitting the component L. Each reference color i after intensity decoupling is represented by\na two-component vector (air , bir ) and is associated with a\nvalue of reference thickness hir for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and hir is\nin the range 0 \u03bcm \u2264 hir \u2264 4 \u03bcm.\nIn Fig. 3a, we show a color sample, which was taken\nalong a diameter of an interference pattern under a drop\n\n\f3\n-2.92 ms\n\n-0.5\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n0\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.62 ms\n\n-0.5\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n1\n\nhe (\u03bcm)\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n1\n\nh (\u03bcm)\n\ne\n\n-0.5\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n0\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.5\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n1\n\n0\n-1\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0.00 ms\n\n4\n\n2\n\ne\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-0.21 ms\n\n4\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.42 ms\n\n4\n\n0\n-1\n\n2\n\nhe (\u03bcm)\n\n0\n-1\n\n4\n\n2\n\ne\n\nhe (\u03bcm)\n\nhe (\u03bcm)\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-1.25 ms\n\nhe (\u03bcm)\n\n4\n\n4\n\nh (\u03bcm)\n\n-2.08 ms\n\nh (\u03bcm)\n\n-3.75 ms\n\n-0.5\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n1\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0 0.5\nx (mm)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4.

After converting\nthe color of each pixel to CIELAB color space and decoupling light intensity, we calculated the color difference\ndE ij for each color (aje , bje ) in the sample (1 \u2264 j \u2264 M =\n596) and each reference color (air , bir ) using the Euclidean\n\n(1)\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M . Since each color (aje , bje ) is\nassociated with a coordinate xj and, recall that each reference color (air , bir ) is associated with a value of reference\nthickness hir , the color difference dE ij can be thought of\nas a function of hir and xj . In figure 3b, we show a plot of\ndE ij in grayscale for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M . The\nrange of the index i translates to the range of reference\nthickness as 0 \u2264 hr \u2264 4 \u03bcm, and j to \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1 mm.\nIn the plot, black means dE = 0 and hence zero color\ndifference, whereas white means the largest color difference. A vertical line at a particular value of x has all\npossible values of the film thickness at that point; the\ncorrect thickness value corresponds to the darkest point.\nIn the case that there are multiple dark points on the\nsame vertical line with insignificant difference between\nthem, thickness determination is not trivial. We note\nthat, however, the film profile is continuous and smooth.\nEvidently, there are only a few continuous dark lines that\ncan be distinguished without any abrupt change in slope.\nIn figure 3b, we show the candidate profiles in white solid\nlines (labeled from (i) to (v)). The film thickness profile\ncan be identified by considering the average color difference hdEi along each candidate profile L:\nhdEiL =\n\n1 X L\ndE ,\nNL\nL\n\n(2)\n\n\f4\nwhere the sum is taken for all the pixels along the profile\nL and then divide by the number of pixels (NL ). In figure 3c, we show hdEiL for all profiles. The smallest color\ndifference is along profile (iv) for which hdEiiv = 0.06,\nwhereas the second smallest one is along profile (iii) for\nwhich hdEiiii = 0.09. As a result, we conclude that profile (iv) is the air layer profile. A test case of an air\nfilm with a known thickness profile shows that the accuracy of our method is within 40 nm (see the Supplemental\nmaterial). To check the reproducibility we repeated the\nexperiment several times and extracted the air thickness\nin each experiment at the same time. The computed profiles are shown in Figs. 3d. Given the variations between\nexperiments such as releasing time, drop size, surface\nproperties, etc., the method gives remarkably consistent\nresults.\nIn figure 4, we show interference patterns obtained during drop impact (V = 0.22 m/s and D = 2 mm) and their\ncorresponding thickness profiles of the air layer. We define t = 0 as the moment when the liquid completely wets\nthe solid surface. From the first pattern detected by the\ncamera (t = \u22123.75 ms), it is readily seen that a dimple\nis already formed, which means that the camera did not\ncapture the entire deformation process of the drop's lower\nsurface, probably due to limited coherence length of the\nlight source used in the present experiment. Subsequent\nprofiles show that the dimple's height gradually reduces,\nwhile the liquid continues spreading in the radial direction. At t = \u22120.42 ms, the liquid starts wetting the glass\nsurface at one point along the rim of the air layer and\nthen propagates to the other side; the wetting process\nhappens faster along the rim where the air thickness is\nsmallest and finally traps air bubbles (indicated by an arrow at t = 0 ms). For experiments done under the same\nconditions, although the time that wetting occurs varies,\nwe observe the same bubble-trapping dynamics, that is,\nthe wetting front propagates faster at the rim and finally\nenclose the air pocket underneath the drop.\nWe note that there is a plateau (at x \u2248 \u00b10.5 mm) in\nthe thickness profiles from t = \u22122.92 ms to t = \u22120.21 ms.\n\n[1] A.M.

Fluid Mech.,\n\nThis is due to the drop's oscillation as it falls down at a\nsmall distance from the surface (in this case H = 6 mm).\nWhen the drop detaches from the needle, capillary waves\nare generated and propagate to the other side. The surface deformation caused by these waves affects the dimple\nshape in addition to the pressure increase in the air layer\nunder the drop. In the case that the drop is released\nfrom a larger height leaving sufficient time for viscosity\nto damp capillary waves, we do not observe the plateau\nin the thickness profiles. As shown in Fig. 3d, the plateau\nis not present in the case of higher impact velocity case\n(V = 1.1 m/s, H = 66 mm).\nWe now quantify the velocity at the center of the\ndimple Vdim (inset of Figs. 5a). As shown in Figs. 5a,\nVdim is found to be very small (roughly two orders of\nmagnitude smaller) as compared to the impact velocity\nV = 0.22 m/s, which implies that the fluid at the bottom of the drop has decelerated before the camera starts\ncapturing the interference fringes. Nonetheless, our measurements capture well the deceleration process of the\nlower surface of the drop from the detection point until it\nis brought to rest. Moreover, we estimate the horizontal\nvelocity of air Vair based on the change in volume confined by a cylinder of radius RC under the liquid surface\n(inset of Figs. 5a). In figure 5b, we show Vair at several\nvalues of RC . The data show a consistent increase of the\nair velocity at a given time as it gets closer to the rim of\nthe air layer where the thickness is minimum. For higher\nimpact velocity cases, the velocity of air is much higher\ndue to the extremely thin air gap at the rim.\nIn conclusion, we have used high-speed color interferometry to measure the complete profile and its evolution\nof the air layer under an impacting drop for impact velocity V = 0.22 m/s and V = 1.1 m/s. From the experimental measurements, we account for the wetting mechanism\nwhich results in entrapment of bubbles after impact. We\nalso experimentally quantify the velocity of air flow between the drop and the surface, as well as the velocity\nof the dimple before wetting occurs. Our results offer a\nbenchmark for theories of drop impact.\nThis study was financially supported by the European\nResearch Council ERC.\n\n647, 163 (2010).\n[8] P.D. Hicks and R. Purvis, J.
