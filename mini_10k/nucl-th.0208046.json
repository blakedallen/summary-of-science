Varya\n\narXiv:nucl-th/0208046v2 29 Apr 2003\n\na\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011, USA\n\nABSTRACT\nWe analyse the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator using effective operator methods in both the strong and weak coupling limits. We show that in the case of a onedimensional model space, the similarity transformation needed to define the effective\nHamiltonian is related to the coefficients in the expansion of the wave function in the\nunperturbed harmonic oscillator basis. We obtain an infinite system of equations which\nis equivalent to those obtained from the Hill Determinant solution of the anharmonic\noscillator. The analytic properties of the resulting equations reveal the non-perturbative\nfeatures of the underlying problem. Thus, we demonstrate the the utility of the effective\noperator method for solving a non-analytic strong coupling problem.\n\n1\n\n\fThe effective operator method [1] has been used extensively and successfully within\na cluster approximation scheme to obtain the low-lying spectroscopy of complex nuclei\n[2] with realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions. Central to the methodology of [1] is the\niterative construction of a similarity transformation which transforms the original hamiltonian to a new hamiltonian having a two-component block diagonal structure where\none component is finite dimensional and accommodates the low-lying spectroscopy. Diagonalising this finite dimensional block diagonal sub-matrix yields a finite number of\neigenvalues to any desired precision corresponding to a subset of the exact solutions. In\na sense, the similarity transformation is designed to decouple a finite dimensional subspace from the rest of the spectrum, even in cases when the original hamiltonian cannot\nbe treated by perturbative methods. However, there are few rigorous results on the existence, or non-existence [3], of the similarity transformation on which the utility of the\nmethod hinges, although several practical issues specific to strongly correlated nuclear\nsystems are under investigation. Thus the formal properties of this effective operator\napproach require additional study, particularly within the framework of problems known\nto be non-perturbative in character. In addition to formal aspects, a deeper understanding of the errors associated with various approximations is required. For example, when\na sequence of clusters is introduced as in the nuclear many body applications [2] we still\nneed to understand how to optimize the convergence with increasing cluster size and/or\nwith increasing model space size. In order to clarify the physical utility of the approach\nand refine our knowledge of its limitations and properties we address a well studied\nnon-perturbative problem, the one dimensional quartic oscillator in both the strong and\nweak coupling regime. In doing so, we shed light on the origins of the decoupling which\nplays such a crucial role.\nThe hamiltonian H that we select, has the form H0 + V where\nH0 =\n\np2\nm\u03c9 2 x2\n+\n2m\n2\n\n(1)\n\nand V = \u03bb x4 .\nThe perturbation expansion for energy eigenvalues is known not to converge, independent of the size of \u03bb [4]. The divergent behaviour of the expansion may be traced\nto the fact that, to large orders in perturbation theory, the growth in the number of\ncontributions is sufficiently rapid to lead to a series that eventually diverges, even for \u03bb\narbitrarily small.\nVarious non-perturbative methods have been applied to extract the eigenvalues [5].\nIn this investigation we will construct an effective Hamiltonian using a similarity transformation along the lines proposed by Lee & Suzuki [1]. In addition to extracting energy\neigenvalues from the effective hamiltonian, the matrix elements of the generator of the\nsimilarity transformation will also be used to develop a system of equations equivalent\nto those obtained from the Hill determinant solution of the anharmonic oscillator.\nWe begin by establishing the following notation: let E denote a generic eigenvalue\nand | \u03a8 > the corresponding exact eigenstate of the Hamiltonian in Eq.1. In that case\nwe have\nH | \u03a8 >= E | \u03a8 >\n(2)\nFollowing [1], we define S, the generator of a similarity transformation such that H\u0303 =\ne\u2212S H eS and | \u03a8 \u0303 > = e\u2212S | \u03a8 > . It then follows that\nH\u0303 | \u03a8 \u0303 > = E | \u03a8 \u0303 >\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fFor now, S is arbitrary but subsequently, restrictions will be placed on S.\nThe next step in the treatment along the lines of [1] is the identification of a suitable\nmodel space (P-Space). We will use a one dimensional model space containing the\nground state of H0 signified by | 0 >. With this choice, P, the projection operator onto\nthe model space is just | 0 >< 0 |. The Q space is then \u03a3 | i >< i |, where the sum over\ni runs over all states of the harmonic oscillator other than the ground state; P and Q\nare orthogonal and P + Q = I.\nThe first constraint we impose on S is that S = QSP . This leads to the identities\nP S = SQ = 0\nand\nS = SP = QS\nThese identities will be used extensively later on. Since P and Q are orthogonal, S 2 = 0\nleading to e\u00b1S = I \u00b1 S. With this choice of P and Q spaces and the restriction on\nS, S reduces to a column vector whose non-vanishing matrix elements are of the form\n< i | S | 0 > (i 6= 0) which will be denoted by Si . The Si will be seen to be related to\nthe expansion coefficients of the true wavefunction in the unperturbed basis. The final\ncondition we impose on S comes from requiring that\nH\u0303P | \u03a8 \u0303 > = EP | \u03a8 \u0303 >\n\n(4)\n\nAs in [1] we define the effective hamiltonian Hef f to be P H\u0303P . In general, diagonalising Hef f yields a subset of energy eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian, since in our case\nHef f is one dimensional we will recover just one eigenvalue for any given S. Expanding\nHef f in terms of S gives\nHef f = P HP + P V S\n(5)\nFrom Eq. 4 and the fact that P and Q are projection operators it follows that QH\u0303P = 0,\nyielding\nSHP + SV S = QV P + QHS\n(6)\nwhich can be rewritten as\nQV P + QHS = SHef f\nAfter subtracting \u03a9 S from both sides of the preceeding equation, (\u03a9 is an arbitrary\nparameter), we obtain the following equation for S\nS = A(QV P \u2212 S(Hef f \u2212 \u03a9))\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\nA = (\u03a9 \u2212 QHQ)\u22121\nNote that since S and Hef f must be \u03a9 independent, \u03a9 is strictly speaking redundant.\nNonetheless, the utility of \u03a9 will soon be made clear. No use has been made of the\nfact that the P space is one dimensional, thus Eqs. 4, 5 & 7 are perfectly general and\nidentical equations arise when treating more complex hamiltonians along the lines of [1].\nSince Hef f depends explicitly on S, Eq. 7 is a non-linear operator equation for S\npotentially admitting more than one solution. In addition, A is ill-defined in an infinite\ndimensional Hilbert Space. In applications to many body problems it is customary\n3\n\n\fto impose an arbitrary cut-off in the Q space which leads to a well defined A, in our\ncase this amounts to neglecting all oscillator quanta above a certain energy. This also\nreduces S to a finite dimensional column vector. Even with this simplification Eq. 7 is\nstill hard to solve exactly; in applications to many body hamiltonians iterative solutions\nare preferred. We propose the following sequence of iterations;\nS (n) = A(QV P \u2212 S (n\u22121) (H (n) ef f \u2212 \u03a9))\nH (n+1) ef f = P HP + P V S (n)\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwith S (0) = 0 as the starting point in the sequence. After a suitable number of iterations\nthe sequence is terminated. Since the P space is one dimensional, the final Hef f is simply\nthe energy eigenvalue, no diagonalisation is necessary. On the other hand, it is necessary\nto check the cut-off independence of the energy eigenvalues and the convergence of the\niterations, this can be done by varying both the cut-off and \u03a9. As a check we calculate\nthe eigenvalues emerging from this procedure after a total of seven iterations. We retain\nonly the first ten harmonic oscillator eigenstates of even parity in calculating A; since\nV does not mix eigenstates of even and odd parity it is adequate to consider only even\nparity states in calculating A. As in [6] we use h\u0304 = 1, \u03c9 = 2 and m = .5 and allow \u03bb to\nvary. Our results (setting \u03a9 = \u22121) are\nIteration(n)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\u03bb = .1\n1.075\n1.06792\n1.06603\n1.06551\n1.06535\n1.06531\n1.06529\n\n\u03bb = .2\n1.15\n1.12612\n1.12035\n1.11886\n1.11845\n1.11834\n1.11831\n\n\u03bb = .3\n1.225\n1.17806\n1.16752\n1.16495\n1.16429\n1.16411\n1.16407\n\n\u03bb=1\n1.75\n1.45479\n1.40423\n1.39484\n1.3929\n1.39248\n1.39238\n\n\u03bb=2\n2.5\n1.7359\n1.62662\n1.61088\n1.60819\n1.60768\n1.60757\n\n\u03bb=3\n3.25\n1.95799\n1.79234\n1.77311\n1.77022\n1.76971\n1.76962\n\nThese results are in excellent agreement with the ground state energies in [6]; extending\nthe size of the Q space used to obtain A changes the eigenvalues (if at all) only at the\nfifth significant figure or beyond. Furthermore, allowing \u03a9 to vary between -2 to +2\nleads to a similarly small change in the obtained eigenvalues. As in [7] we can access\ndifferent solutions for S and thus different eigenvalues, by choosing a different range of\nvalues for \u03a9.\nGiven that the hamiltonian is non-perturbative the convergence of the sequence of\niterations is non-perturbative in character; furthermore the error induced by truncating\nthe Q space to construct A is small. Since truncation of the Q space in the manner\njust described is a key ingredient in the application of effective operator methods in\nmany body hamiltonians, we will attempt to understand why this procedure is valid.\nMore precisely, we will show that at least for the purposes of calculating low lying\neigenvalues, S may be accurately approximated by a column vector of finite dimension;\nsince S = QSP , it then follows the Q space needed to define A is effectively finite\ndimensional which justifies the truncation we employ.\nWe start by expanding Eq. 4 in terms of S and H leading to\n(H \u2212 SH + HS \u2212 SHS)P | \u03a8 >= EP | \u03a8 >\n4\n\n(10)\n\n\fIn order to derive an identity for E in terms of the Si we expand | \u03a8 > in terms of\nthe eigenstates of H0 as follows\n| \u03a8 >=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1n | n >\n\n(11)\n\nThe sum in Eq. 11 begins from zero and runs over all positive integers. For the sake of\nfuture notational convenience we will denote < n | A | m > by Anm where A is any\noperator. Inserting the form of | \u03a8 > from Eq. 11 into Eq. 10 and operating with < 0 |\non both sides yields\nE =< 0 | H | 0 > + < 0 | HS | 0 >\n(12)\nassuming that \u03b10 is non-vanishing. Inserting a complete set of states yields\nE = H00 + V02 S2 + V04 S4\n\n(13)\n\nexploiting the fact that the quartic perturbation connects the ground state only to\nstates | 2 > and | 4 >. Eq. 13 is a special case of a more general expression for the exact\neigenenergy resulting from an effective hamiltonian in a one-dimensional model space\nderived in [7].\nEquations for the remaining Si may be obtained by sandwiching Eq.6 between | 0 >\nand < n | where n 6= 0. Doing so and using the fact that P and Q are projection\noperators gives\n< n | SH | 0 > + < n | SV S | 0 > = < n | V | 0 > + < n | HS | 0 >\n\n(14)\n\nBy judicious insertions of complete sets of states, the left hand side of Eq. 14 can be\nreduced to\nSn (H00 + V02 S2 + V04 S4 )\nThe term within brackets is just E from Eq. 13. Thus Eq. 14 may be written as\nSn E =< n | V | 0 > + < n | HS | 0 >\n\n(15)\n\nInserting a complete set of states yields\nSn E = Vn0 +\n\nX\n\nHnm Sm\n\n(16)\n\nm\n\nAs before we will assume n to be even, the extension to include odd n is straightforward.\nInserting different values of n into Eq. 16 leads to a system of coupled equations for the\nSn . For n = 2 we have,\nV20 + (H22 \u2212 E)S2 + V24 S4 + V26 S6 = 0\n\n(17)\n\nV40 + V42 S2 + (H44 \u2212 E)S4 + V46 S6 + V48 S8 = 0\n\n(18)\n\nFor n = 4 we have,\n\nFor n = i and i > 4, there is no term independent of S. The equation takes the form\nVii\u22124 Si\u22124 + Vii\u22122 Si\u22122 + (Hii \u2212 E)Si + Vii+2 Si+2 + Vii+4 Si+4 = 0\n5\n\n(19)\n\n\fWe can make all the preceeding equations homogenous with the generic substitution\nSi =\n\n\u03b2i\n\u03b20\n\nWith this substitution Equations 13, 17, 18 read\n(H00 \u2212 E)\u03b20 + V02 \u03b22 + V04 \u03b24 = 0\nV20 \u03b20 + (H22 \u2212 E)\u03b22 + V24 \u03b24 + V26 \u03b26 = 0\nV40 \u03b20 + V42 \u03b22 + (H44 \u2212 E)\u03b24 + V46 \u03b26 + V48 \u03b28 = 0\n\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n\nFor larger values of n it is adequate to replace Si by \u03b2i in Eq. 19 giving\nVii\u22124 \u03b2i\u22124 + Vii\u22122 \u03b2i\u22122 + (Hii \u2212 E)\u03b2i + Vii+2 \u03b2i+2 + Vii+4 \u03b2i+4 = 0\n\n(23)\n\nFor the sake of comparison, we substitute the expansion from Eq. 11 into Eq. 2. Restricting ourselves to \u03b1i with i even yields\n(H00 \u2212 E)\u03b10 + V02 \u03b12 + V04 \u03b14 = 0\nV20 \u03b10 + (H22 \u2212 E)\u03b12 + V24 \u03b14 + V26 \u03b16 = 0\nV40 \u03b10 + V42 \u03b12 + (H44 \u2212 E)\u03b14 + V46 \u03b16 + V48 \u03b18 = 0\n\n(24)\n(25)\n(26)\n\nand for larger values of i we have\nVii\u22124 \u03b1i\u22124 + Vii\u22122 \u03b1i\u22122 + (Hii \u2212 E)\u03b1i + Vii+2 \u03b1i+2 + Vii+4 \u03b1i+4 = 0\n\n(27)\n\nIt is clear that \u03b1i and \u03b2i satisfy the same set of equations. However, solving for the \u03b1i is\nequivalent to solving the Hill determinant for the quartic oscillator [6]. Since the Si are\nproportional to the \u03b2i , the Si may also be obtained from solving the Hill determinant.\nFurthermore, the physical significance of the Si is apparent, the Si may be taken equal\n(up to an overall constant) to the coefficients arising in the expansion of the true wave\nfunction in the unperturbed basis. As far as we are aware, this is the first instance where\na connection between S and the expansion of the wave function in unperturbed basis\nhas been established.\nThe \u03b1i may be independently determined by the requirement that\ndet(H \u2212 EI) = 0\nfor an invertible H. It can be shown that this requirement is equivalent to the more\ngeneral statement in [7] of which Eq. 13 is a special case [8]. This provides an independent\ncross-check of our results.\nThere are additional constraints on the Si for large i which arise from the behaviour\nof the matrix elements Vij at large i. To derive these constraints, let us rewrite Eq. 19\nas follows,\nVii\u22124 Si\u22124 + Vii\u22122 Si\u22122 + Hii Si + Vii+2 Si+2 + Vii+4 Si+4 = ESi\n\n(28)\n\nFor large i the matrix elements appearing in Eq. 28 have the approximate form\n< i | x4 | (i + 4) > = (\n\nh\u0304 2 1 2\n) ( ) i (1 + 5/i) + * * *\nm\u03c9\n4\n\n6\n\n(29)\n\n\fh\u0304 2 2\n) i (1 + 3/i) + * * *\nm\u03c9\nh\u0304 2 3\n) ( ) (2i2 + 2i + 1)\n(\nm\u03c9\n4\nh\u0304 2 2\n(\n) i (1 \u2212 1/i) + * * *\nm\u03c9\nh\u0304 2 1 2\n) ( ) i (1 \u2212 5/i) + * * *\n(\nm\u03c9\n4\nh\u0304\n(\n)i+***\n2 m\u03c9\nh\u0304\n)i+***\n(\n2 m\u03c9\nh\u0304\n(\n)(2i + 1)\n2 m\u03c9\n\n< i | x4 | (i + 2) > = (\n< i | x4 | i > =\n< i | x4 | (i \u2212 2) > =\n< i | x4 | (i \u2212 4) > =\n< i | x2 | (i + 2) > =\n< i | x2 | (i \u2212 2) > =\n< i | x2 | i > =\n\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n(36)\n\nwhere higher order finite terms in the expansion have been neglected. As can be seen\nfrom the above equations, the left hand side of Eq. 28 contains both quadratic and linear\ndivergences in i at large i, and no such divergences appear on the right. Eq. 28 will be\nconsistent only if Si fall off rapidly for large i aided by possible cancellations due to\nsign differences between the various Si appearing on the left. As a consequence of the\nSi falling off rapidly, low energy eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian are expected to be\nonly weakly dependent on high energy eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian. As\na check, we allow i in Eq. 28 to run over a limited range of even values beginning at\n0, and compute the lowest energy eigenvalues from the resulting equations. We use the\nsame numerical values for the parameters as before and allow \u03bb to vary over the same\nrange. The results are summarised in the table below:\nimax/2 \u2193 \u03bb \u2192 .1\n.2\n.3\n1\n5\n1.06529 1.11829 1.16406 1.39337\n10\n1.06529 1.11829 1.16405 1.39235\n15\n1.06529 1.11829 1.16405 1.39235\n20\n1.06529 1.11829 1.16405 1.39235\n\n2\n1.61123\n1.60755\n1.60754\n1.60754\n\n3\n1.77481\n1.76963\n1.76959\n1.76959\n\nThe entries in the table are the lowest energy eigenvalues obtained from sets of not\nmore than 20 equations, and are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by\nour iterative procedure and with [6]. This is strong support of our earlier claim that\nlow energy eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian are only weakly dependent on high energy\nstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian. It is now clear why the truncation of the Q space\nwhich was implemented in order to facilitate the iterative procedure is justified. The\ndecoupling of high energy states in a toy model has been independently studied in [9];\nhowever unlike the quartic oscillator the hamiltonian in [9] can be analytically inverted,\npermitting the use of methods very different from the ones we employ in this paper.\nAs an additional analytical check on the decoupling of Si for large i, we consider the\nfollowing Ansatz for large i,\nSi+j\njf (j/2) m2 \u03c9 3\n\u223c (\u22121)j/2 (1 \u2212\n)\nSi\ni\n\u03bbh\u0304\n7\n\n(37)\n\n\fwhere f is some arbitrary unspecified function. Inserting this Ansatz into Eq. 28 and\nusing the asymptotic forms of the matrix elements given earlier, we see that Eq. 28 is\nfree of divergences in i provided\nf (\u22122) \u2212 f (2) + 2f (1) \u2212 2f (\u22121) + 1 = 0\n\n(38)\n\nThe utility of Eqs. 38 & 37 will become apparent when we investigate what happens\nwhen \u03bb is so large that it dominates the quadratic term in the potential. In that case\nthe hamiltonian may be conveniently expressed as\np2\nm\u03c9 2 x2\nm\u03c9 2 x2\n+\n+ \u03bbx4 \u2212\n2m\n2\n2\n2 2\n\nFollowing the same procedure as before but with V = \u03bbx4 \u2212 m\u03c92 x gives an equation\nidentical to Eq. 28 but with different values of Hii , and Vii\u00b12 . This is not surprising as\nthe structure of Eq. 28 does not rely on the precise form of V but on the fact that the\nonly non-vanishing matrix elements Vij have | (i \u2212 j) |\u2264 4, which is the case for both\nforms of V that we consider.\nOnce again, consistency requires that all divergences quadratic and linear in i cancel\non the left hand side of Eq. 28 with V modified to study the strong coupling limit. Using\nthe approximate forms of the relevant matrix elements given earlier, it is straightforward\nto verify that the recursion relation in Eq. 37 originally derived to analyse finite coupling\nis sufficient to gaurentee the cancellations in the strong coupling limit as well. The only\ndifference between the two cases lies presumably only in the O(1/i2 ) term which plays no\nrole in cancellation of divergences. This is a further indication of the non-perturbative\nnature of the effective operator method.\nTo conclude, we have implemented an an effective operator treatment of the anharmonic oscillator on the lines of [1]. We have analyzed the validity of a key simplification\nmade in the treatment of the nuclear many body problem. The role of the expansion\nof the exact eigenfunction in the basis of the unperturbed hamiltonian in defining S,\nthe generator of the similarity transformation has been emphasized. Both the strong\nand weak coupling cases may be treated along the same lines, underscoring the nonperturbative nature of the formulation. Our numerical application demonstrates rapid\nconvergence to known results with modest effort.\nThis work was supported in part by U.S. DOE Grant No. DE-FG-02-87ER-40371,\nDivision of High Energy and Nuclear Physics.\n\nReferences\n[1] K.
