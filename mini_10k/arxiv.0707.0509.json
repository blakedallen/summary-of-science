We illustrate our conclusions by Monte Carlo calculations of the quantum rotor model in\nd = 2 space dimensions.\nPACS numbers: 05.70.Jk,73.43.Nq, 05.70.Fh, 05.30.Jp\n\nTo probe the dynamical response of an interacting\nquantum many-body system one typically investigates its\nresponse to an externally applied time-dependent force\nthat perturbs the system slightly away from equilibrium. The two-point time-dependent correlation function (TPCF) is the quantity which encodes the physical response of the system to that perturbation in linear response theory [1]. In this way, the TPCF contains\ninformation about the nature of the excitations of the\nunperturbed system. If the system is close to a continuous (thermodynamic or quantum) phase transition, under certain assumptions (e.g. long-distances), the orderparameter TPCF may acquire a universal form independent of the microscopic details of the interactions. This\nis the beauty and power of the general theory of critical\nphenomena. Establishing this universal functional form,\nand determining the exponents involved, is a common\ntheme in classical and quantum critical phenomena [2].\nQuantum Critical Phenomena has been introduced as\nan straightforward extension of Classical Critical Phenomena [3]. The motivation is clear and can be traced\nback to the formal functional-integral mapping between\na quantum problem in d space dimensions and a classical\nstatistical mechanics problem in d + 1, where the extra\ndimension corresponds to the (imaginary) time axis \u03c4\n(see, for example, [4]). Space and time coordinates do\nnot necessarily satisfy Lorentz symmetry. A measure of\nthe asymmetry is quantified by the dynamic critical exponent z which is equal to unity when Lorentz invariance\nis present. Common wisdom dictates that at the critical\npoint gc continuous phase transitions display a correlation length \u03be diverging as \u03be \u223c |g \u2212 gc |\u2212\u03bd with critical exponent \u03bd > 0, and control parameter g (temperature in\nthe case of thermodynamic phase transitions). Similarly,\nthe correlation time diverges as \u03c4c \u223c \u03be z . This fact reflects the scale invariance of the system at criticality. It is\n\n1\nS[\u03c8, \u03c8 ] =\n2\n\u2217\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1/T\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nV\n\nthen emphasized that consequently the equal-time (orderparameter) TPCF G(r, \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 = 0) should decay algebraically with the distance r = |r|, G(r, 0) \u223c 1/rd+z\u22122+\u03b7 ,\nthus defining a characteristic exponent \u03b7 (anomalous dimension). Different relations or laws are satisfied by the\nvarious exponents as a result of scaling hypotheses (e.g.\nin the free energy) [5].\nThe purpose of this paper is to note that the common\nlore depicted above is not always mathematically justified\nin quantum critical phenomena and, most importantly,\ninadequate in certain cases of physical relevance. The\nroot of the discrepancy lies in the lack of particle-hole\nsymmetry in the case of non-vanishing chemical potential\n\u03bc, which leads to a non-divergent length at criticality and\nshort-range equal-time correlations as determined from\nG(r, 0). This in turn implies that when \u03bc 6= 0 there is no\npower law scaling ansatz in G(r, 0) at the critical point.\nOn the other hand, the zero-frequency order-parameter\ncorrelation function, G(r, \u03c9 = 0), does display long-range\npower law behavior at criticality with a divergent correlation length \u03be for arbitrary \u03bc. This illustrates the fundamental physical distinction between equal-time and zerofrequency correlations. We will present both a theoretical\nproof of these statements within the Ginzburg-LandauWilson (GLW) paradigm of quantum phase transitions,\nwith an analytic calculation for the quantum spherical\nmodel, and a numerical confirmation in the quantum rotor model. Our conclusions rigorously apply as long as\nthe dynamics of the order parameter of a given microscopic quantum model is faithfully described by this kind\nof GLW effective field theory. This holds regardless of\nthe nature of the original degrees of freedom, i.e whether\nbosonic or fermionic. Moreover, similar derivations can\nbe performed with multicomponent order parameters.\nOur starting quantum model is of the familiar phenomenological GLW form\n\n\b\nu0\ndd r \u2212 \u03c8 \u2217 (r, \u03c4 )[(\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bc)2 + \u22072r ]\u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) + r0 |\u03c8(r, \u03c4 )|2 + |\u03c8(r, \u03c4 )|4 ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) is the space and (Euclidean) timedependent complex order parameter field, r0 and u0 are\nphysical parameters, V = Ld is the volume, and T is\nthe temperature.\nThe partition function is given by\nR\nZ = D[\u03c8]D[\u03c8 \u2217 ] exp(\u2212S[\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2217 ]). This (Euclidean) action S is symmetric under the transformation \u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) \u2192\n\u2212\u03c8(r, \u03c4 ), but it is not particle-hole symmetric because\n\u03bc is, in general, not zero. This GLW functional represents an analytic expansion (in the vicinity of the critical\npoint) in \u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) with interaction terms respecting the\ngroup of symmetries G of the disordered phase.\nUnder the assumption of (bosonic) periodic boundary\nconditions along the time axis, one can Fourier transform\nthe fields as\nr\nT X i(k*r\u2212\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\u03c8(r, \u03c4 ) =\n\u03c8\u0303(k, \u03c9),\n(2)\ne\nV\nk,\u03c9\n\nwith Matsubara frequencies \u03c9 = 2\u03c0T n (n =\n0, \u00b11, \u00b12, * * * ),\nand discrete momenta k\u03b1\n=\n2\u03c0p\u03b1 /L (p\u03b1 = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, * * * ) with \u03b1 = 1, * * * , d.\nThen,\n1X\n[(\u03c9 \u2212 i\u03bc)2 + k 2 + r0 ]|\u03c8\u0303(k, \u03c9)|2\n2\nk,\u03c9\nZ\nZ\nu0 1/T\ndd r|\u03c8(r, \u03c4 )|4 .\nd\u03c4\n+\n4 0\nV\n\nS =\n\n(3)\n\nIntroducing an auxiliary scalar field \u03c6(r, \u03c4 ), we decouple\nthe last term by the Hubbard-Stratonovich identity\nu0\n\nR\n\nR\n\nd\n\n4\n\ne\u2212 4 Z d\u03c4 d r|\u03c8(r,\u03c4 )| = const.\nR\nR d\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\u00d7 D[\u03c6]e\u2212 2 d\u03c4 d r[i\u03c6(r,\u03c4 )|\u03c8(r,\u03c4 )| + 2u0 \u03c6 (r,\u03c4 )] , (4)\n\nEquivalently, we can define a correlation length \u03be\nZ\n1\ndd k\n\u22122\n2\np\n\u03be = r0 \u2212 \u03bc + u0\n,\n(2\u03c0)d 2 k 2 + \u03bc2 + \u03be \u22122\n\nwhere \u03be \u22122 \u2261 r0 + i\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 \u03bc2 . Clearly, this integral displays an ultraviolet divergence that needs to be regularized. To avoid this divergence, here\nP we adopt a lattice\nregularization by replacing k 2 \u2192 \u03b1 2(1 \u2212 cos k\u03b1 ) and\nR dd k\nP\n\u2192 (1/V ) k , which correctly takes into account\n(2\u03c0)d\nthe long-wavelength contributions while providing an intrinsic cutoff due to the lattice constant.\nFigure 1 shows the behavior of \u03be in two and three dimensions, where, without loss of generality, we set u0 = 1\nand use r0 as the control parameter to signal the quantum phase transitions for \u03bc = 0 and \u03bc 6= 0. We see\nthat \u03be diverges as one approaches the quantum critical\npoint. Below we show that \u03be is actually the correlation\nlength, which gives the diverging (or singular) behavior\nat criticality, but it is not the length characterizing the\nTPCF.\nWith this correlation length \u03be, the order-parameter\n(connected) TPCF is given by\nG(r, \u03c4 ) = h\u03c8(r, \u03c4 )\u03c8 \u2217 (0, 0)i \u2212 h\u03c8(r, \u03c4 )ih\u03c8 \u2217 (0, 0)i\nZ\ndd kd\u03c9\nei(k*r\u2212\u03c9\u03c4 )\n=\n(2\u03c0)d+1 (\u03c9 \u2212 i\u03bc)2 + k 2 + \u03bc2 + \u03be \u22122\n\u03bc\u03c4 (1\u2212d)\ne \u03bb\n\u03c1\u2212(d\u22121)/2 K(d\u22121)/2 (\u03c1)\n(8)\n=\n(2\u03c0)(d+1)/2\nfor d \u2265 1, where \u03bb\u22122 \u2261 \u03bc2 + \u03be \u22122 , \u03c1 = (r2 + \u03c4 2 )1/2 /\u03bb,\nand Kn (\u03c1) is the modified spherical Bessel function of\n\n100\n\nwith the result for the modified action S\u0304[\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c6]\n\nIn order to investigate the order-parameter TPCF explicitly, we will adopt a saddle-point approximation to\nevaluate the integral over \u03c6.

Therefore, for \u03bc 6= 0,\nthe long-range behavior of the TPCF near the critical\npoint (\u03be \u22122 \u2192 0) reduces to\n\u221a\n\n2\n\n2\n\ne\u2212\u03bc( r +\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 )\n,\nG(r, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n(r2 + \u03c4 2 )d/4\n\n(10)\n\nwhile, for \u03bc = 0, G(r, \u03c4 ) \u223c 1/(r2 + \u03c4 2 )(d\u22121)/2 . We note\nthat, for \u03bc 6= 0, the equal-time spatial correlation shows a\nshort-range behavior characterized by a length \u03bb \u223c 1/\u03bc,\nnot by the diverging \u03be, while the temporal correlation\ndoes display long-range behavior.\nThe long-range correlation associated with the divergence of \u03be, however, leads to the susceptibility thermodynamic sum rule [2] so that G\u0303(k, \u03c9) = 1/[(\u03c9 \u2212 i\u03bc)2 +\nk 2 + \u03bc2 + \u03be \u22122 ] \u2192 \u221e as \u03be \u2192 \u221e in the long-wavelength\n(k \u2192 0) and low-frequency (\u03c9 \u2192 0) limit. Therefore, the\nrange of the zero-frequency correlation function is characterized by \u03be in the form\n\u001a\nexp(\u2212r/\u03be)/r(d\u22121)/2 r/\u03be \u226b 1;\nG(r, \u03c9 = 0) \u223c\n(11)\n1/rd\u22122\nr/\u03be \u226a 1,\nwhich, at criticality, is often compactly represented as\nG(r, \u03c9 = 0) \u223c exp(\u2212r/\u03be)/rd\u22122 . Note that this form is\nthe same as that of the d-dimensional classical criticality. We may view that the long-range spatial correlation\nat zero-frequency is brought by the long-range temporal\ncorrelation, even though the equal-time correlations are\nshort ranged.\nWe see that in the model a non-vanishing \u03bc brings in\nan imaginary term linearly coupled to \u03c9 in the action.\nWithout this term, the quantum fluctuations along the\ntemporal and spatial directions are isotropic, yielding a\ndynamical critical exponent z = 1, and the mapping of\nthe d-dimensional quantum phase transition to the (d +\nz)-dimensional classical phase transition is well justified.\nFor \u03bc 6= 0, the term breaking the particle-hole symmetry\ncauses an asymmetry in the temporal direction leading\nto z = 2 (i.e. there is no Lorentz invariance). This\nasymmetry property should not change at higher orders\nin u0 . The formal solution, including the effect of u0 , is\nG\u0303(k, \u03c9) =\n\n1\n(\u03c9 \u2212\n\ni\u03bc)2\n\n+\n\nk2\n\n+ r0 \u2212 \u03a3(r0 , u0 , \u03bc; k, \u03c9)\n\n, (12)\n\nwhere the self-energy \u03a3(r0 , u0 , \u03bc; k, \u03c9) \u2192 0 as u0 \u2192 0\nand \u03a3(r0c , u0 , \u03bc; 0, 0) = r0c \u2212 \u03bc2 at the critical point r0 =\nr0c . Therefore, we expect that the self-energy term does\nnot alter the nature of the broken particle-hole symmetry\ncaused by a non-zero \u03bc, although it may introduce an\nanomalous exponent \u03b7 6= 0.\n\nOur analytic results are now confirmed by a Monte\nCarlo calculation of the quantum rotor model\nX\nU X 1 \u2202\ncos(\u03b8r \u2212 \u03b8r\u2032 ), (13)\n\u2212 n\u0304)2 \u2212 2J\nH=\n(\n2 r i \u2202\u03b8r\n\u2032\nhr,r i\n\nwhere U represents the rotational energy scale of a rotor at site r, J denotes the coupling strength between\nnearest-neighbor sites hr, r\u2032 i, and a non-zero n\u0304 (n\u0304 \u2261 \u03bc/U )\nbreaks the particle-hole symmetry. In the following, we\nwill show that the correlations of this model near criticality are correctly captured by the effective (GLW) model\nof Eq. (1).\nWe performed Monte Carlo calculations of the total\nTPCF Gt (r, \u03c4 ) = h\u03c8(r, \u03c4 )\u03c8 \u2217 (0, 0)i = hei[\u03b8(r,\u03c4 )\u2212\u03b8(0,0)]i in\na square lattice of size L \u00d7 L \u00d7 L\u03c4 , with periodic boundary conditions, where L is the size in a spatial direction\nand L\u03c4 in the temporal direction. For Monte Carlo calculations, we represent the quantum rotor model in the\nform of a classical (d + 1)-dimensional action [6]\nS[J] =\n\n\u2207*J=0\n1 X \b 2\n2\n2\nJx(r,\u03c4 ) + Jy(r,\u03c4\n) + (J\u03c4 (r,\u03c4 ) \u2212 n\u0304) ,(14)\n2K\n(r,\u03c4 )\n\np\nwhere K \u223c\n2J/U is the tuning parameter controlling the quantum fluctuations, J\u03b1 's are integers, and\n\u2207 * J = 0 represents the current conservation condition\nat each site. We use a recently developed worm algorithm\n[7] to update the current configurations in Eq. (14) and\nmeasure the correlation functions.\nFigure 2 shows the TPCF as a function of x, a distance\nalong a spatial axis, in a lattice of size 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 400 in\nthe vicinity of the critical point Kc = 0.2978, which is\ndetermined by finite-size scaling of the superfluid stiffness, for \u03bc/U = 0.20. Inspired by Eq. (10), we use the\nfitting function\n\u0010 e\u2212x/l\ne\u2212(L\u2212x)/l \u0011\n,\n+\nGt (x, \u03c4 = 0) = C + A\nx\n(L \u2212 x)\n\n(15)\n\nfor 1 \u226a x \u226a L and obtain l \u2248 1.4 \u2212 1.9 for different\nK's and sizes, while C = |h\u03c8i|2 depends sensitively on\nK. This result strongly supports the fact that the equaltime TPCF has a short-range behavior, characterized by\na finite rather than a diverging correlation length.\nTo understand the nature of l, we measure it as a function of \u03bc at the critical point in Fig. 3. Our results clearly\nshow that 1/l is proportional to \u03bc, and l remains finite\nexcept at integer fillings (\u03bc = 0) where the particle-hole\nsymmetry is restored.\nThe long-range nature of one-particle correlations can\nbe observed in G(r, \u03c9 = 0). In Fig. 4, the zerofrequency total correlation function, defined by Gt (x, \u03c9 =\nPL\u03c4\n0) \u2261\n\u03c4 =1 Gt (x, \u03c4 ), displays long-range behavior near\nthe critical point. We can easily see that, by subtracting\nout the constant part to obtain G(r, \u03c9 = 0), the correlation range is still beyond the size of the system.\n\n\f4\n\nK= 0.2970\nK= 0.2975\nK= 0.2977\nK= 0.2978\nK= 0.2980\nK= 0.2983\nK= 0.2986\n\n1\n\nG(x,0)\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\nx\n\n30\n\n40\n\n1/l\n\nG(x,0)\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.5\n\n0.0001\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\nx\n\nIn summary, we have shown that, when particle-hole\nsymmetry is broken, the physical quantity that displays\na diverging length at criticality is the zero-frequency and\nnot the equal-time correlation function. The latter is\nshort-ranged and within our paradigm of quantum phase\ntransitions it is not Lorentz invariant. We have not only\nproved this statement analytically but also illustrated its\ncorrectness by studying the planar quantum rotor model.\nThis model shares the same critical properties as the\nBose-Hubbard model [8] assuming that only phase fluctuations are responsible for its critical behavior. This\nobservation is quite relevant given the current interest\nin the experimental simulation of quantum phase transitions in optical lattices of ultracold atomic gases [9].\nM.-C.C. thanks the hospitality of the Department of\nPhysics at Indiana University where parts of this work\nwere carried out, and the support by the Korea Research\nFund Grant No. KRF-2005-041-I01625.\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 3:\nThe inverse length, 1/l, at the critical point\n(\u03be \u22121 = 0) displays the behavior 1/l \u221d \u03bc/U .
