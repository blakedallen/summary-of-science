We study the geometry of compact Lorentzian manifolds that admit a somewhere timelike Killing vector field, and whose isometry group has\ninfinitely many connected components. Up to a finite cover, such manifolds are\nproducts (or amalgamated products) of a flat Lorentzian torus and a compact\nRiemannian (resp., lightlike) manifold.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nParadigmatic example. We will deal with dynamics and geometry of the following\nflavor. Let q be a Lorentz form on Rn ; this induces a (flat) Lorentz metric on the\ntorus Tn = Rn /Zn . The linear isometry group of Tn is O(q, Z) = GL(n, Z) \u2229\nO(q), and its full isometry group is the semi-direct product O(q, Z) \u22c9 Tn .\nThe global and individual structure of O(q, Z) involves interesting geometric,\narithmetic and dynamical interactions.PFor generic q, O(q, Z) is trivial. Nonetheless, if q is rational, i.e., if q(x) =\naij xi xj , where aij are rational numbers,\nthen O(q, Z) is big in O(q); more precisely, by Harich-Chandra-Borel theorem, it\nis a lattice in O(q). When q is not rational, many intermediate situations are possible. It is a finite volume non co-compact lattice in the case of the standard form\nq0 = \u2212x21 +x22 +. . .+x2n , but can be co-compact for other forms. On the other hand,\na given element A \u2208 O(q0 , Z), could have complicated dynamics. For instance,\nif A is hyperbolic, i.e., its spectrum is not contained in S1 , then the remainder of\neigenvalues are roots of unity or Salem numbers. Conversely, any Salem number\nis the eigenvalue of such a hyperbolic A \u2208 O(q0 , Z), for some dimension n.\nLorentz geometry and dynamics. The global geometry of compact manifolds endowed with a non positive definite metric (pseudo-Riemannian manifolds) can be\nquite different from the geometry of Riemannian manifolds. For instance, compact\npseudo-Riemannian manifolds may fail to be geodesically complete or geodesically connected; moreover, the isometry group of a compact pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifold fails to be compact in general. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the geometric structure of Lorentz manifolds essentially non Riemannian, i.e.,\nwith non compact isometry group.\nLorentzian manifolds, i.e., manifolds endowed with metric tensors of index 1,\nplay a special role in pseudo-Riemannian geometry, due to their relations with\nGeneral Relativity.

ZEGHIB\n\nfact that, unlike the Riemannian case, Lorentzian isometries need not be equicontinuous, and may generate chaotic dynamics on the manifold. For instance, the\ndynamics of Lorentz isometries can be of Anosov type, evocative of the fact that\nin General Relativity one can have contractions of time and expansion in space. A\ncelebrated result of D'Ambra (see [3]) states that the isometry group of a real analytic simply-connected compact Lorentzian manifold is compact. It is not known\nwhether this results holds in the C \u221e case. In the last decade several authors have\nstudied isometric group actions on Lorentz manifolds. Most notably, a complete\nclassification of (connected) Lie groups that act locally faithfully and isometrically\non compact Lorentzian manifolds has been obtained independently by Adams and\nStuck (see [1]) and the second author (see [17]). Roughly speaking, the identity\ncomponent G0 of the isometry group of a compact Lorentz manifold is the direct\nproduct of an abelian group, a compact semi-simple group, and, possibly, a third\nfactor which is locally isomorphic to either SL(2, R) or to an oscillator group, or\nelse to a Heisenberg group. The geometric structure of a compact Lorentz manifold that admits a faithful isometric action of a group G isomorphic to SL(2, R) or\nto an oscillator group is well understood; such manifolds can be described using\nright quotients G/\u0393, where \u0393 is a co-compact lattice of G, and warped products,\nsee Section 3 for more details. Observe that such constructions produce Lorentz\nmanifolds on which the G0 -action has some timelike orbit. Recall that a Lorentz\nmanifold is said to be stationary if it admits an everywhere timelike Killing vector\nfield. Our first result (Theorem 3.1) is that when the identity component of the\nisometry group is non compact and it has some timelike orbit, then it must contain\na non trivial factor locally isomorphic to SL(2, R) or to an oscillator group.\nThus, next natural question is to study the geometry of manifolds whose isometry group is non compact for having an infinite number of connected components.\nResults. We will show in this paper that compact Lorentz manifolds with a large\nisometry group are essentially constructed in the same way. In order to define the\nappropriate notion of the lack of compactness of the isometry group of a Lorentzian\nmanifold, let us give the following:\nDefinition. Let \u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 GL(E) be a representation of the group G on the vector\nspace E. Then, \u03c1 is said to be of Riemannian type if it preserves some positive\ndefinite inner product on E. We say that \u03c1 is of post-Riemannian type if it preserves\na positive semi-definite inner product on E having kernel of dimension equal to 1.\nObserve that \u03c1 is of Riemannian type if and only if it is precompact, i.e., \u03c1(\u0393) is\nprecompact in GL(E).\nGiven a Lorentzian manifold (M, g), we will denote by Iso(M, g) its isometry\ngroup, and by Iso0 (M, g) the identity connected component of Iso(M, g). The Lie\nalgebra of Iso(M, g) will be denoted by Iso(M, g). By a large isometry group,\nwe mean that the adjoint action of the discrete part \u0393 = Iso(M, g)/Iso0 (M, g) of\nIso(M, g) is not of post-Riemannian type. This implies, in particular, that \u0393 is not\nfinite.\nThe main result of the paper is that compact Lorentz manifolds with large isometry group are essentially built up by tori. More precisely, we prove the following\nstructure theorem.\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n3\n\n1. Theorem. Let (M, g) be a compact Lorentz manifold, and assume that the conjugacy action of \u0393 on Iso0 (M, g) is not post-Riemannian. Then, Iso0 (M, g) contains a torus T = Td , endowed with a Lorentz form q, such that \u0393 is a subgroup of\nO(q, Z).\nUp to a finite cover, there is a new Lorentz metric gnew on M having a larger\nisometry group than g, such that \u0393 = O(q, Z). Geometrically, M is metric direct\nproduct T \u00d7 N , where N is a compact Riemannian manifold, or M is an amalgamated metric product T \u00d7S1 L, where L is a lightlike manifold with an isometric\nS1 -action. The last possibility holds when \u0393 is a parabolic subgroup of O(q).\nA more precise description of the original metric g is given in Section 8 for\nthe hyperbolic case and in Section 9 for the parabolic case. We will in fact prove\nTheorem 1 under an assumption weaker than the non post-Riemannian hypothesis\nfor the conjugacy action of \u0393. The more general statement proved here is the\nfollowing:\n2. Theorem. Assume that \u0393 is infinite and that Iso0 (M, g) has a somewhere timelike orbit. Then the conclusion of Theorem 1 holds.\nTheorem 1 will follow from Theorem 2 once we show that, under the assumption\nthat the conjugacy action of \u0393 is not of post-Riemannian type, then the connected\ncomponent of the identity of the isometry group must have some timelike orbits,\nsee Subsection 2.3.\nA first consequence of our main result is the following:\n3. Corollary. Assume that (M, g) is a compact Lorentzian manifold with infinite\ndiscrete part \u0393. If (M, g) has a somewhere timelike Killing vector field, then\n(M, g) has an everywhere timelike Killing vector field.\nWe will also prove (Proposition 4.1) that, when (M, g) has a Killing vector\nfield which is timelike somewhere, then the two situations (a) and (b) below are\nmutually exclusive:\n(a) the connected component of the identity Iso0 (M, g) of Iso(M, g) is non\ncompact;\n(b) Iso(M, g) has infinitely many connected components, as in the case of the\nflat Lorentzian torus.\nThe point here is that, in a compact Lorentzian manifold, the flow of a Killing vector field which is timelike somewhere generates a non trivial precompact group in\nthe (connected component of the identity of the) isometry group. Thus, by continuity, the Lie algebra of the isometry group of such manifolds must contain a non\nempty open cone of vectors generating precompact 1-parameter subgroups in the\nisometry group. The proof of Proposition 4.1 is obtained by ruling out the existence of a non compact abelian or nilpotent factor in the connected component of\nthe isometry group. The argument is based on an algebraic precompactness criterion for 1-parameter subgroups of Lie groups proved in Proposition 2.11.\nMoreover, using Theorem 2 and previous classification results by the second\nauthor, we prove the following partial extension of D'Ambra's result to the C \u221e realm:\n4. Theorem. The isometry group of a simply connected compact Lorentzian manifold that admits a Killing vector field which is somewhere timelike is compact.\n\n\f4\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nLet us give a sketch of the proof of our main result. After the preliminaries, in\nSection 5 we show the existence of an appropriate reduction of the isometry group.\nMore precisely, we show that Iso(M, g) has a closed non compact subgroup G\nwhose identity component G0 is compact abelian, it has some timelike orbit, and\nthe quotient \u0393 = G/G0 is torsion free. Moreover, the conjugacy action of G on\nG0 \u223c\n= Tk , denoted by \u03c1 : G \u2192 Out(T k ) \u223c\n= GL(k, Z), preserves some Lorentz\nform of Rk ; thus, the image \u03c1(G) is contained in GL(k, Z) \u2229 SO(q) for some\nLorentz quadratic form q. The proof of our structure result is then obtained by\nrelating the dynamics of an isometry f \u2208 G, f 6\u2208 G0 , on M , and the dynamics\nof the conjugacy action of f on the toral factor G0 . In this step the proof splits\ninto two cases, according to whether \u03c1(f ) is a parabolic or a hyperbolic element\nof SO(q). We will make full use of the techniques developed by the second author\nin [18], in particular we will employ the notions of approximate stable foliation\nand of strongly approximate stable foliation of an isometry of a compact Lorentz\nmanifold. This analysis will show the existence of a possibly smaller torus Td \u2282\nTk , d \u2265 2, whose action on M is everywhere free and timelike. In the hyperbolic\ncase, the orthogonal distribution to the Td -orbits is integrable; a general covering\nLemma (Section 7) will yield the product structure of (a finite covering of) M . The\namalgamated product structure in parabolic case is somewhat more involved, and\nit is discussed in Section 9.\n2. P RELIMINARIES\nIn this section we will collect several auxiliary results needed in the rest of the\npaper.\n2.1. Toral subgroups. Our aim here is to determine the freeness of isometric toral\nactions on manifolds. The key fact is that the set S(Td ) of all closed subgroups of\nthe d-torus Td is countable, and it satisfies a uniform discreteness property.\nLemma 2.1. Let X be a locally compact metric space, and let \u03c6 : X \u2192 S(Td ) be\na semi-continuous map, that is, if xn \u2192 x, then any limit of \u03c6(xn ) is contained in\n\u03c6(x). Then, there exists A \u2208 S(Td ) such that \u03c6\u22121 (A) has non empty interior.\n\b\nProof. For A \u2208 S(T ), set FA = x \u2208 X : such that A \u2282 \u03c6(x) . By the\nsemi-continuity, the closure \u03c6\u22121 (A) \u2282 FA for all A \u2208 S(T\u0001d ). Clearly, X =\nS\n\u03c6\u22121 (A). By Baire's theorem, the interior int \u03c6\u22121 (A) of some \u03c6\u22121 (A)\n\nA\u2208S(Td )\n\n\u0001\nmust be non empty. Thus, the intersection int \u03c6\u22121 (A) \u2229 \u03c6\u22121 (A) is non empty.\nLet x be a point of such intersection, so that A = \u03c6(x), and there is a neighborhood\nV of x such that \u03c6(y) \u2283 \u03c6(x) for all y \u2208 V . By semi-continuity, we must have\nequality \u03c6(y) = \u03c6(x) for y in some neighborhood V \u2032 \u2282 V . This follows from the\nfact that A is an isolated point of the set:\n\b\nS(Td ; A) = B \u2208 S(Td ) : A \u2282 B ,\nsee Lemma 2.2. Hence, \u03c6\u22121 (A) has non empty interior.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.2. Every A \u2208 S(Td ) is isolated in S(Td ; A).\nProof. Let us consider the case that A is the trivial subgroup. To prove that A =\n{1} is isolated in S(Td ) it suffices to observe that there exist two disjoint closed\nsubsets C1 , C2 \u2282 Td such that C1 is a neighborhood of 1, C1 \u2229 C2 = \u2205, and with\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n5\n\nthe property that if B \u2208 S(Td ) is such that B \u2229 C1 6= {1}, then B \u2229 C2 6= \u2205. For\ninstance,\n\b one can take C1 to be the closed ball around 1 of radius r > 0 small, and\nC2 = p \u2208 Td : 2r \u2264 dist(p, 1) \u2264 3r . Here we are considering the distance\non Td = Rd /Zd induced by the Euclidean metric of Rd . The number r can be\nchosen in such a way that C1 \u2229 C2 = \u2205. Every non trivial element in C1 has some\npower in C2 , which proves that C1 and C2 have the required properties. Thus, if\nAn \u2208 S(Td ) is any sequence which is not eventually equal to A, then some limit\npoint of An must be contained in C2 , and therefore lim An 6= A. If one replaces\nTd by a finite quotient of Td , then one gets to the same conclusion by essentially\nthe same proof. The general case is obtained by considering the quotient Td /A,\nwhich is equal to a finite quotient of a torus.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.3. If X is a locally compact metric space and \u03c6 : X \u2192 S(Td ) is\nsemi-continuous, then, there is a dense open subset U \u2282 X, where \u03c6 is locally\nconstant, i.e., any x \u2208 U has a neighborhood V where \u03c6 is constant.\nProof. Let U be the open subset of X given by the union of the interiors of the sets\n\u03c6\u22121 (A), with A running in S(Td ). This is the largest open subset of X where \u03c6\nis locally constant. If U were not dense, then there would exist a non empty open\nsubset V \u2282 X with V \u2229 U = \u2205. The restriction \u03c6e of \u03c6 to V is a semi-continuous\nmap, with the property that \u03c6e\u22121 (A) has empty interior for all A \u2208 S(Td ). By\nLemma 2.1, this is impossible, hence U is dense.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.4. Any faithful isometric action of a torus Td on some pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g) is free on a dense open subset of M .\nProof. Apply Corollary 2.3 to the map \u03c6 : M \u2192 S(Td ) that associates to each\np \u2208 M its stabilizer. Such map is obviously semi-continuous. Thus, on a dense\nopen subset U of M , the stabilizer of the isometric action is locally constant. No\nnontrivial isometry of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold fixes all points of a non\nempty open subset, and this implies that the stabilizer of each point of U is trivial.\n\u0003\n2.2. Linear dynamics. Gauss maps (and variants) have the advantage to transform the dynamics on M into a linear dynamics, i.e., an action of the group in\nquestion on a linear space or an associated projective space, via a linear representation. We will prove in the sequel a stability result: if a linear group \"almostpreserves\" a Lorentz form, then it (fully) preserves another one. We start with the\nindividual case, i.e., with actions of the infinite cyclic group Z, and then we will\nconsider general groups.\n2.2.1. Individual dynamics. Let E be a vector space, and A \u2208 GL(E). It has a\nJordan decomposition A = EHU , where U is unipotent (i.e., U \u2212 1 is nilpotent),\nH hyperbolic (i.e., diagonalizable over R), and E is elliptic (i.e., diagonalizable\nover C, and all its eigenvalues have norm equal to 1).\nIf F is a space obtained from E by functorial constructions, e.g., F = Sym(E \u2217 )\nthe space of quadratic forms on E, or F = Grd (E) the Grassmannian of d-dimensional subspaces of E, the associated A-action on F will be denoted by AF .\nNaturally, when F is a vector space, we have AF = E F H F U F .\nA point p \u2208 E is A-recurrent if there is ni \u2208 N, ni \u2192 \u221e, such that Ani (p) \u2192 p\nas i \u2192 \u221e. A point p is A-escaping if for any compact subset K \u2282 E there is N\n\n\f6\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nsuch that An (p) \u2208\n/ K, for n > N . So, p is non-escaping if there is ni \u2192 \u221e, such\nn\ni\nthat A p stay in some compact set K \u2282 E.\nIt is easy to prove the following\nLemma 2.5. Let p \u2208 F be a point recurrent under the AF -action. Then p is fixed\nby H F and U F . If F is a vector space, p is AF -non-escaping iff p is fixed by H F\nand U F .\nRecall that an element A of the orthogonal group of a Lorentz form q is hyperbolic if it has one eigenvalue \u03bb with |\u03bb| =\n6 1, and A is parabolic if it is not diagonalizable (over C). In other words, A is hyperbolic if it is conjugate in GL(k, R)\n(in fact in SO(q)) to a matrix of the form:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb 0\n\uf8ed 0 \u03bb\u22121 0 \uf8f8\n0\nR\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 R, \u03bb > 1, and R \u2208 SO(k \u2212 2). Similarly, A is parabolic if it has the\nnormal form:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\n1 t \u2212 t2\n\uf8ec0 1\n0\uf8f7\nt\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed0 0 1\n0\nR\nwith t \u2208 R and R \u2208 SO(k \u2212 3).\nLemma 2.6. Set F = Sym(E), and assume A = EHU non-elliptic (i.e., either H or U is non-trivial). Suppose there is a Lorentz form q0 which is Arecurrent,\nand let K \u2282 GL(E) be the torus generated by the powers of E. Then,\nR\nF (q ) d\u03bc(B) is an A-invariant Lorentz form, where \u03bc is the Haar measure\nB\n0\nK\non K.\nProof. Assume H 6= 1. By Lemma 2.5, H preserves q0 . Then, there exists \u03bb \u2208\nR \\ {1}, such that \u03bb, \u03bb\u22121 \u2208 \u03c3(A). The eigenspaces V\u03bb and V\u03bb\u22121 are isotropic,\nhence 1-dimensional. Namely, for v \u2208 V\u03bb , q0 (v, v) = q0 (Hv, Hv) = \u03bb2 q0 (v, v);\nsimilarly, for v \u2208 V\u03bb\u22121 , q0 (v, v) = \u03bb\u22122 q0 (v, v). In both cases, one must have\nq0 (v, v) = 0. It follows that the direct sum E\u03bb = V\u03bb \u2295 V\u03bb\u22121 \u223c\n= R2 is timelike, and\nthe Lorentzian form q0 |E\u03bb is H-invariant.\nObserve now that E\u03bb is the unique 2-space on which H is non-elliptic (i.e., all\nits powers are uniformly unbounded). Thus, any endomorphism commuting with\nH preserves E\u03bb . Therefore, E preserves E\u03bb . A similar argument yields that E\npreserves the orthogonal E\u03bb\u22a5 (with respect to q0 ), since it is the maximal subspace\non which H acts elliptically.\n2\nOn the other\n\u0013 to multiples, the only quadratic form on R which is\n\u0012 hand, up\n\u03bb 0\n, with \u03bb 6= 1, is the form (x1 , x2 ) 7\u2192 x1 x2 . As above,\npreserved by\n0 \u03bb\u22121\nsince E commutes with H, it preserves this quadratic form on E\u03bb .\nFrom all this, it follows that E n preserves the fixed Lorentzian metric q0 |E\u03bb for\nall n, while in the orthogonal\nspace to E\u03bb the restriction of q0 is positive definite.\nR\nHence, the average K B F (q0 ) d\u03bc(B), which is A-invariant, is equal to q0 on E\u03bb\nand positive definite on the orthogonal of E\u03bb .\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n7\n\nNow the case H = 1 but U 6= 1 can be treated in analogous way, using essentially that E commutes with U , and that U has the normal form of a parabolic\nelement in SO(q0 ), see the proof of Lemma 6.2 for a similar argument.\n\u0003\n2.2.2. Group dynamics. We consider now a group \u0393 acting on E via a representation \u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 GL(E). One can naturally develop a theory of recurrence leading in\nparticular to a variant of the previous lemma for groups.\nProposition 2.7. Let \u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 GL(E) be such that \u03c1(a) is non-elliptic for any\na \u2208 \u0393. Let F = Sym(E), and assume that the associated action \u03c1F preserves\na compact set of F contained in the (open) subset of Lorentz forms, and that \u03c1F\nleaves invariant a finite measure on such compact set. Then, \u03c1(\u0393) preserves some\nLorentz form.\nThe proof of Proposition 2.7 occupies the remainder of this subsection.\nFor a \u2208 \u0393, let H(a) and U (a) be the hyperbolic and unipotent parts of \u03c1(a),\nrespectively. Let q0 be a form recurrent under the \u0393-action. By Lemma 2.5, q0 is\npreserved by any H(a) and any U (a), a \u2208 \u0393. Let \u0393\u22c6 be the group generated by\n{H(a), U (a) : a \u2208 \u0393}. Then \u0393\u22c6 is a subgroup of SO(q0 ).\nA subgroup L \u2282 SO(q0 ) is non-elementary if it does not preserve a timelike\nor a lightlike direction in E. To simplify, let us assume that \u0393\u22c6 is not elementary;\nthe elementary case can be treated separately. For instance, a subgroup of SO(q)\npreserves a timelike direction if and only if it is pre-compact. More precisely,\npreserving a Lorentz form and a timelike direction is equivalent to preserving a\npositive definite inner product.1 The case of a lightlike direction looks like the\nprevious case of a group generated by a single element.\nLemma 2.8. Let L be a non-elementary subgroup of SO(q0 ). Then:\n(1) There is a unique decomposition E = A \u2295 B, characterized by the fact that\nH acts precompactly on B and non precompactly on A. Furthermore, the\ndecomposition is q0 -orthogonal, with A timelike and B spacelike.\n(2) Any Lorentz form q invariant under L decomposes as \u03bbq0 |A + \u03b4, where \u03b4\nis a positive definite form on B.\nIt follows in particular that any A \u2208 GL(E) normalizing L respects the decomposition, and the image A\u2217 q0 has the previous form.\nProof. For part (1), if L does not act irreducibly, then it leaves invariant some\nsubspace R \u2282 E. By the non-elementarity hypothesis, R is spacelike, or timelike\nwith dimension larger than 1. If R is spacelike, then we consider its orthogonal\nR\u22a5 which is timelike and with dimension greater than 1. Iterating the process,\nwe get a timelike subspace A of dimension greater than 1, having no proper Linvariant subspace, that is, L acts irreducibly on A. One can show that the orbit\nLu is unbounded for any non zero vector u \u2208 A. Namely, let A0 be the subspace\nof A consisting of vectors u whose L-orbit is bounded. This is clearly L-invariant,\n1 If a subgroup H of SO(q) preserves a direction spanned by a timelike vector e, then it also\n\npreserves its spacelike orthogonal, and therefore it preserves the positive product obtained from q by\nreversing the sign of q(e). Conversely, if H preserves both a Lorentz form q and a positive definite\ninner product q0 , then it commutes with the q0 -symmetric operator S defined by q = q0 (S*, *).\nSuch operator S has precisely one negative eigenvalue, and the corresponding timelike direction is\npreserved by H. Note that this implies in particular that no precompact subgroup of SO(q) acts\nirreducibly on E .\n\n\f8\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nand by irreducibility it is either 0 or the whole E.\u0001 But A0 cannot coincide with\nA, because otherwise the image \u0001of L in SO q|A would be precompact, and no\nprecompact subgroup of SO q|A acts irreducibly. Thus, every non zero element\nof A has unbounded L-orbit.\nClearly, the action of L on the orthogonal space B = A\u22a5 is precompact, as q0 is\npositive definite on B.\nLet (u, v) \u2208 A \u2295 B, with u 6= 0. Then, there is a sequence li \u2208 L, such that the\ndirection of li (u, v) converges to a direction in A, because li (u) is unbounded and\nli (v) is bounded. Hence, A is an attractor, and such dynamical characterization\nimplies the uniqueness of A as an irreducible timelike L-invariant subspace.\nFor part (2), let q be another L-invariant Lorentz form. Using the dynamical\nproperties of L on A and B, one proves that A and B are q-orthogonal. Namely,\nconsider the set {u \u2208 A : u is q-orthogonal to B}. This is an L-invariant subspace\nof A, and by irreducibility it is either {0} or equal to A. Let us show that it is non\nzero. Fix u \u2208 A, u 6= 0, and let li be a sequence in L such that li u is unbounded.\nChoose an auxiliary norm k*k in A and set ui = li u/kli uk; up to subsequences, we\ncan assume that limi ui = u\u221e \u2208 A and u\u221e 6= 0. We claim that u\u221e is q-orthogonal\nto B; namely, given v \u2208 B, q(u\u221e , v) = limi q(ui , v) = limi q(u, li\u22121 v)/kli uk = 0,\nbecause li u is bounded.\nIt remains to check the proportionality condition along A. For this, we can\nassume B = 0, and that L acts irreducibly on E. Then, q can be written by means\nof q0 via an endomorphism S of E, i.e., as bilinear forms, q = q0 (S*, *). The fact\nthat L preserves both q and q0 implies that S commutes with the elements of L. Let\nus show that S has at least one real eigenvalue. Consider the group R = SO(q) \u2229\nSO(q0 ); since R contains L, then it acts irreducibly on E. Now, R must contain\neither a hyperbolic or a unipotent element. Namely, R is a non compact algebraic\ngroup, and it has finitely many connected components. The connected component\nof the identity of R is a connected non compact Lie group, so it must contain a\nnon precompact 1-parameter subgroup. Hence, it contains at least one non elliptic\nelement. Also, an algebraic group is closed under Jordan decomposition, i.e., if\nA \u2208 R, then its elliptic, its hyperbolic and its unipotent factors belong to R. This\nproves that R contains either a hyperbolic or a unipotent element. Such element\nhas at least one real eigenvalue of multiplicity 1, and the corresponding eigenline\nis preserved by S. Thus, S has at least one real eigenvalue. The corresponding\nS-eigenspace is L-invariant, and by irreducibility, such eigenspace must coincide\nwith E. It follows that S is a homothety, and this concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nApply Lemma 2.8 to L = \u0393\u22c6 , with the key observation that \u0393 normalizes \u0393\u22c6 ,\nthat is, \u03c1(a)\u0393H \u03c1(a)\u22121 = \u0393H for all a, since H(aba\u22121 ) = \u03c1(a)H(b)\u03c1(a)\u22121 and\nU (aba\u22121 ) = \u03c1(a)U (b)\u03c1(a)\u22121 . It follows that \u0393 preserves the decomposition, and\n\u03c1(a)\u2217 q0 = \u03bb(a)q0 |A +\u03b4(a). We know that H(a) and U (a) preserve q0 , and thus the\nimage by \u03c1(a) coincides with its image under the elliptic part E(a), that is, E(a)\nacts homothetically on (A, q0 ). But, since E(a) is elliptic, we have, \u03bb(a) = \u00b11.\nIn fact, \u03bb(a) = +1, since we know that \u03c1\u2217 (a)q0 is a Lorentz form.\nSummarizing, the action of \u0393 is q0 -isometric on A, and each element a acts on\nB via its elliptic part E(a), in other words \u03c1(a)|B = E(a)|B . In order to prove that\n\u0393 preserves a Lorentz form on E it suffices to show that its action (via the E(a))\npreserves a positive definite form on B. More precisely, let \u0393E be the subgroup of\nGL(B) generated by the E(a)'s. It is true that any A \u2208 \u0393E is elliptic, in particular\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n9\n\nit preserves a positive definite form. However, there are exotic examples of groups\nwith all elliptic elements that are not pre-compact (see [15])! This is why in the\nstatement of Proposition 2.7 we make an assumption stronger than just recurrence,\nbut rather the existence of a an invariant measure. The hypothesis can be here\nseen as equivalent to the existence of an invariant measure on the space Sym(B)\nsupported on the open subset of positive-definite quadratic forms. At this stage,\none could use Furstenberg Lemma which says, roughly speaking, that linear groups\npreserving a volume act pre-compactly on its support, see [19]. The proof of this\nstatement in the\nR present situation is straightforward. If \u03bc is the preserved measure,\nthen the mean Sym(B) q d\u03bc(q) is a positive definite quadratic form, invariant under\nthe \u0393-action.\nThis completes the proof of Proposition 2.7. \u0003\nCorollary 2.9. Let \u0393 be a subgroup of GL(k, Z) which acts on Sym(Rk ) by preserving a finite measure supported in a in the open set of Lorentz forms. Then, up\nto a finite index, \u0393 preserves a Lorentz form.\nProof. Indeed, up to a finite index, we can assume that \u0393 has no torsion elements.\nThis follows from Selberg Lemma (which says that a finitely generated matrix\ngroup has a torsion free subgroup of finite index, see for instance [2]). But, in a\ndiscrete group an elliptic A element has finite order, because the group {An , n \u2208\nZ} is bounded and thus finite. We deduce that, up to a finite index, \u0393 has no elliptic\nelement, and thus Proposition 2.7 applies.\n\u0003\n2.3. A Gauss map. Let (M, g) be a compact Lorentzian manifold, let Iso(M, g)\ndenote its isometry group, which is Lie group (see for instance [9]), and denote\nby Iso0 (M, g) the connected component of the identity of Iso(M, g). The Lie\nalgebra of Iso(M, g) will be denoted by Iso(M, g); let us recall that there is a\nLie algebra anti-isomorphism from Iso(M, g) to the space of Killing vector field\nKill(M, g) obtained by mapping a vector v \u2208 Iso(M, g) to the Killing field K v\nwhich is the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter group of isometries R \u220b\nt 7\u2192 exp(tv) \u2208 Iso(M, g). If \u03a6 is a diffeomorphism of M and K is a vector field\non M , we will denote by \u03a6\u2217 (K) the push-forward\nof\u0001K by \u03a6, which is the vector\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\nfield given by \u03a6\u2217 (K)(p) = d\u03a6 \u03a6 (p) K \u03a6 (p) for all p \u2208 M . If \u03a6 is an\nisometry and K is Killing, then \u03a6\u2217 (K) is Killing.\nIf \u03a6 \u2208 Iso(M, g), then:\n(2.1)\n\n\u03a6\u2217 (K v ) = K Ad\u03a6 (v) ,\n\n\u2200 v \u2208 Iso(M, g).\n\nIt will be useful to introduce the following map. Let Sym(g) denote the vector\nspace of symmetric bilinear forms on g. The Gauss map G : M \u2192 Sym(g) is the\nmap defined by\n\u0001\n(2.2)\nGp (v, w) = gp K v (p), K w (p) ,\nfor p \u2208 M and v, w \u2208 g. The following identity is immediate:\n\u0001\n(2.3)\nG\u03a6(p) = Gp Ad\u03a6 *, Ad\u03a6 * ,\n\nfor all \u03a6 \u2208 Iso(M, g). In this paper we will be interested in the case where (M, g)\nadmits a Killing vector field which is timelike somewhere. In this situation, the\nimage of the Gauss map contains a Lorentzian (nondegenerate) symmetric bilinear\nform on g (in fact, a non empty open subset consisting of Lorentzian forms, this\nwill be used in Lemma 5.4).\n\n\f10\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nWe now have the necessary ingredients to show how the proof of Theorem 1 is\nobtained from Theorem 2.\nProof of Theorem 1 from Theorem 2. Let us assume that the action of the discrete\npart \u0393 on Iso0 (M, g) is not of post-Riemannian type; we will show by contradiction that Iso0 (M, g) has a somewhere timelike orbit. Let \u03ba be the quadratic form\non Iso(M, g) defined by\nZ\nGp (v, w) dM (p),\n\u03ba(v, w) =\nM\n\nthe integral being taken relatively to the volume element of the Lorentzian metric\ng. By (2.1), \u03ba is invariant by the conjugacy action. If Iso0 (M, g) has no timelike\norbit, then \u03ba is positive semi-definite. The proof will be concluded if we show that\nthe kernel K = Ker(\u03ba) has dimension less than or equal to 1. Assume that K is not\ntrivial, i.e., that \u03ba is positive semi-definite. If v \u2208 K, then for all w \u2208 Iso(M, g)\nand all p \u2208 M , gp (Kpv , Kpw ) = 0; in particular, gp (Kpv , Kpv ) = 0, i.e., K v is\nan everywhere isotropic2 Killing vector field on M . Non trivial isotropic Killing\nvector fields are never vanishing, see for instance [4, Lemma 3.2]; this implies\nthat the map K \u220b v 7\u2192 Kpv \u2208 Tp M is an injective vector space homomorphism\nfor all p \u2208 M . On the other hand, its image has dimension 1, because an isotropic\nsubspace of a Lorentz form has dimension at most 1, hence K has dimension 1. \u0003\n2.4. Precompactness of 1-parameter sugroups. It will be useful to recall that\nthere is a natural smooth left action of Iso(M, g) on the principal bundle F(M ) of\nall linear frames of T M , defined as follows. If b = (v1 , . . . , vn ) is a linear\nbasis\n\u0001\nof Tp M , then for \u03a6 \u2208 Iso(M, g) set \u03a6(b) = d\u03a6p(v1 ), . . . , d\u03a6p (vn ) , which is\na basis of T\u03a6(p) M . The action of Iso(M, g) on F(M ) is defined by Iso(M, g) \u00d7\nF(M ) \u220b (\u03a6, b) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03a6(b) \u2208 F(M ). Given any frame b \u2208 F(M ), then the map\nIso(M, g) \u220b \u03a6 7\u2192 \u03a6(b) \u2208 F(M ) is an embedding of Iso(M, g) onto a closed\nsubmanifold of F(M ) (see [9, Theorem 1.2, Theorem 1.3]), and thus the topology\nand the differentiable structure of Iso(M, g) can be studied by looking at one of\nits orbits in the frame bundle. In particular, the following will be used at several\npoints:\nPrecompactness criterion. If H \u2282 Iso(M, g) is a subgroup that has one orbit in\nF(M ) which is contained in a compact subset of F(M ), then H is precompact.\nFor instance, if H preserves some Riemannian metric on M and it leaves a non\nempty compact subset of M invariant, then H is precompact.\nLemma 2.10. Let (M, g) be a compact Lorentzian manifold and K be a Killing\nvector field on M . If K is timelike at some point, then it generates a precompact\n1-parameter subgroup of isometries in Iso0 (M, g).\n\u0001\nProof. Let p \u2208 M be such that g K(p), K(p) < 0. Consider the compact subsets\nof T M given by:\nn\n\u0001\n\u0001o\nV = K(q) : q \u2208 M is such that g K(q), K(q) = g K(p), K(p) ,\n2Here we use the following terminology: a vector v \u2208 T M is isotropic if g(v, v) = 0, and it is\nlightlike if it is isotropic and non zero.\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n11\n\nand\n\nn\no\n\u0001\n\u0001\nV \u22a5 = v \u2208 K(q)\u22a5 : q \u2208 M s.t. g K(q), K(q) = g K(p), K(p) , g(v, v) = 1 .\n\nConsider an orthogonal basis b = (v1 , . . . , vn ) of Tp M with v1 = K(p) and\ng(vi , vj ) = \u03b4ij for i, j \u2208 {2, . . . , n}. The 1-parameter subgroup generated by K\nin Iso(M, g) can be identified with the R-orbit of the basis b by the action of the\nflow of K on the frame bundle\nF(M ). Every vector of a basis of the orbit belongs\nS\nto the compact subset V V \u22a5 , and this implies that the orbit of b is precompact in\nthe frame bundle F(M ).\n\u0003\n2.5. An algebraic criterion for precompactness. Now observe that if a compact\nmanifold (M, g) admits a Killing vector field which is timelike somewhere, then,\nby continuity, sufficiently close Killing fields are also timelike somewhere. Thus,\nif one wants to study the (connected component of the) isometry group of a Lorentz\nmanifold that has a Killing vector field which is timelike at some point, it is a natural question to ask is which (connected) Lie groups have open sets of precompact\n1-parameter subgroups. The problem is better cast in terms of the Lie algebra; we\nwill settle this question in our next:\nProposition 2.11. Let G be a connected Lie group, K \u2282 G be a maximal compact\nsubgroup, and k \u2282 g be their Lie algebras. Let m be a AdK -invariant complement\nof k in g. Then, g has a non empty open cone of vectors that generate precompact\n1-parameter subgroups of G if and only if there exists v \u2208 k such that the restriction\nof adv : m \u2192 m is an isomorphism.\nProof. Let C \u2282 g be the cone of vectors that generate precompact 1-parameter\nsubgroups of G; we want to know when C has non empty interior. Clearly C contains k, and every element of C is contained in the Lie algebra k\u2032 of some maximal\ncompact subgroup K \u2032 of G. Since all maximal compact subgroups of G are conjugate (see for instance [8]), it follows that C = AdG (k), i.e., C is the image of\nthe map F : G \u00d7 k \u2192 g given by F (g, v) = Adg (v). We claim that C has non\nempty interior if and only if the differential dF has maximal rank at some point\n(g, v) \u2208 G \u00d7 k. The condition is clearly sufficient, and by Sard's theorem is also\nnecessary; namely, if dF has never maximal rank then all the values of F are critical, and they must form a set with empty interior. The second claim is that it\nsuffices to look at the rank of dF at the points (e, v), where e is the identity of G.\nThis follows easily observing that the function is G-equivariant in the first variable.\nNow, the differential of F at (e, v) is easily computed as:\ndF(e,v) (g, k) = [g, v] + k = [m, v] + k.\nThus, dF(e,v) is surjective if and only if there exists v \u2208 k such that [m, v] = m,\nwhich concludes the proof.\n\u0003\n3. T HE\n\nIDENTITY CONNECTED COMPONENT OF THE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\nThe geometric structure of compact Lorentz manifold whose isometry group\ncontains a group which is locally isomorphic to an oscillator group or to SL(2, R)\nis well known. Let us recall (see [17, \u00a71.6]) that a compact Lorentz manifold\nthat admits a faithful isometric action of a group locally isomorphic to SL(2, R)\nhas universal cover which is given by a warped product of the universal cover\nof SL(2, R), endowed with the bi-invariant Lorentz metric given by its Killing\n\n\f12\n\nP.

Every such manifold admits everywhere timelike Killing vector field, corresponding to the timelike vectors of the Lie algebra\nsl(2, R).\nOscillator groups are characterized as the only simply-connected solvable and\nnon commutative Lie groups that admit a bi-invariant Lorentz metric (see [11]);\noscillator groups possess a lattice, i.e., a co-compact discrete subgroup. More precisely, an oscillator group G is a semi-direct product S1 \u22c9 Heis, where Heis is\na Heisenberg group (of some dimension 2d + 1). There are positivity condition\non the eigenvalues of the automorphic S1 action on the Lie algebra heis (ensuring\nthe existence of a bi-invariant Lorentz metric), and arithmetic conditions on them\n(ensuring existence of a lattice).\nIt is interesting and useful to consider oscillator groups as objects completely\nsimilar to SL(2, R), from a Lorentz geometry viewpoint. In particular, regarding\nour arguments in the present paper, both cases are perfectly parallel. Let us notice\nhowever, some differences (but with no incidence on our investigation here). First,\nof course, the bi-invariant Lorentz metrics on an oscillator group do not correspond\nto its Killing form, since this latter is degenerate (because the group is solvable).\nAnother fact, in non-uniqueness of these bi-invariant metrics, but surprisingly, their\nuniqueness up to automorphism. In the SL(2, R)-case, we have uniqueness up\nto a multiplicative constant. Also, we have essential uniqueness of lattices in an\noscillator group, versus their abundance in SL(2, R).\nLet us describe briefly the construction of Lorentz manifolds endowed with a\nfaithful isometric G-action, where G is either SL(2, R) or an oscillator group.\nThe construction starts by considering right quotients G/\u0393, where \u0393 is a lattice\nof G. The G-left action is isometric exactly because the metric is bi-invariant.\ne, g\ne)\nA slight generalization is obtained by considering a Riemannian manifold (N\ne\nand quotients of the direct metric product X = N \u00d7 G by a discrete subgroup\ne, g\ne) \u00d7 G. Observe here that since the isometry group of the Lorentz\n\u0393 of Iso(N\ne, g\ne) \u00d7 (G \u00d7 G), it is possible to take a quotient by a subgroup\nmanifold X is Iso(N\n\u0393 contained in this full group. The point is that we assumed G acting (on the left)\non the quotient, and hence, G normalizes \u0393; but since G is connected, it centralizes\n\u0393. Therefore, only the right G factor in the full group remains (since the centralizer of the left action is exactly the right factor). Observe however that \u0393 does not\nnecessarily split. Indeed, there are examples where \u0393 is discrete co-compact in\ne, g\ne) \u00d7 G, but its projection on each factor is dense!\nIso(N\nNext, warped products yield a more general construction. Rather than a direct\ne \u00d7 G with a metric of the form g\ne \u2295 \u03ba, one endows N\ne \u2295 w\u03ba,\nproduct metric g\ne\nwhere w is a positive function on N , and \u03ba is the bi-invariant Lorentz metric on G.\nHere, there is one difference between the case of SL(2, R) and the oscillator case.\nFor SL(2, R) this is the more general construction, but in the oscillator case, some\ne and also a mixing of their metrics, is also possible,\n\"mixing\" between G and N\nsee [17, \u00a71.2]. Finally, to be more accurate, it should be emphasized that it is the\nuniversal cover of G that must be considered in these constructions. (It turns out\nhowever that, it is a finite cover of G which acts faithfully and not the universal\ncover. This is because of the compactness assumption on the Lorentz manifold M ,\nsee [17, \u00a72]).\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n13\n\nLet us study now the situation when the isometry group does not contain any\ngroup which is locally isomorphic to SL(2, R) or to an oscillatory group.\nTheorem 3.1. Let (M, g) be a compact Lorentz manifold that admits a Killing vector field which is timelike at some point. Then, the identity component of its isometry group is compact, unless it contains a group locally isomorphic to SL(2, R) or\nto an oscillator group.\nProof. By the classification result in [1, 17], if Iso0 (M, g) does not contain a group\nlocally isomorphic to SL(2, R) or to an oscillator group, then Iso(M, g) can be\nwritten as a Lie algebra direct sum h + a + c, where h is a Heisenberg algebra, a is\nabelian, and c is semi-simple and compact. Our aim is to show that the Heisenberg\nsummand h in fact does not occur in the decomposition, and that the abelian group\nA corresponding to the summand a is compact. By the assumption that (M, g) has\na Killing vector field which is timelike at some point, Iso(M, g) must contain a\nnon empty open cone of vectors that generate a precompact 1-parameter subgroup\nof Iso0 (M, g) (Lemma 2.10). The first observation is that, since c is compact,\nif h + a + c has an open cone of vectors that generate precompact 1-parameter\nsubgroups, than so does the subalgebra h + a. Moreover, by the same compactness\nargument, we can also assume that the abelian Lie subgroup A is simply connected.\nThe proof of our result will be concluded once we show that given any Lie group\nG with Lie algebra g = h + a, h and a as above, does not have an open set of\nprecompact 1-parameter subgroups. To this aim, write h+a = m+k, with k the Lie\nalgebra of a maximal compact subgroup K of G and m a k-invariant complement\nof k in g. If either h or a is not zero, then also m is non zero. Since h+a is nilpotent,\nfor no x \u2208 k the map adx : m \u2192 m is injective, and by Proposition 2.11, G does\nnot have an open set of precompact 1-parameter subgroups.\n\u0003\n4. W HEN\n\nTHE ISOMETRY GROUP HAS INFINITELY MANY CONNECTED\nCOMPONENTS\n\nLet us now study the situation when the isometry group of a Lorentzian manifold\nwith a timelike Klling vector field has infinitely many connected components.\nExample. An important example is that of a flat torus, see for instance [5]. Consider a Lorentzian scalar product g0 in Rn , and let the quotient M = Tn = Rn /Zn\nbe endowed with the induced metric, still denoted by g0 . Then, Iso(M, g0 ) is isomorphic to the semi-direct product Tn \u22ca O(g0 , Z), where O(g0 , Z) is the infinite\ndiscrete group O(g0 ) \u2229 GL(n, Z).\n4.1. Compactness of the identity connected component. A first consequence of\nTheorem 3.1 is that when Iso(M, g) has infinitely many connected components,\nthen the connected component of the identity has to be compact. Before proving\nthis, let us recall a general fact on the isometry group of a covering. If (M, g) is a\nf \u2192 M is a covering, let g\ne be the pseudopseudo-Riemannian manifold and \u03c0 : M\nf\nRiemannian metric on M given by the pull-back of g by \u03c0, so that \u03c0 becomes\nf, g\ne) be the closed subgroup consisting of all\na local isometry. Let H \u2282 Iso(M\n\u0001\ne\nf\nf\nisometries f : M \u2192 M that descend to the quotient M , i.e., such that \u03c0 f \u0303(x) =\n\u0001\n\u03c0 f \u0303(y) whenever \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y). There is a natural homomorphism \u03c6 : H \u2192\nIso(M, g) that associates to each fe \u2208 H the unique isometry f of M such that\nf \u25e6 \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u25e6 fe. The kernel of \u03c6 is a discrete subgroup \u0393 of H given by the group\n\n\f14\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nof covering automorphisms of \u03c0. If \u03c0 is the universal covering of M , then the\nhomomorphism \u03c6 is surjective, and H is precisely the normalizer Nor(\u0393) of \u0393 in\nf, g\ne), so that Iso(M, g) is isomorphic to the quotient Nor(\u0393)/\u0393.\nIso(M\n\nProposition 4.1. Let (M, g) be a compact Lorentzian manifold that admits a somewhere timelike Killing vector field. If Iso(M, g) has infinitely many connected\ncomponents, then Iso0 (M, g) is compact.\n\nProof. By Theorem 3.1, if Iso0 (M, g) is not compact, then it contains a group\nwhich is locally isomorphic to SL(2, R) or to an oscillator group, in which case\nthe geometric structure of (M, g) is well understood (see [17, Theorem 1.13, Theorem 1.14]).\nAssume that Iso0 (M, g) contains a group locally isomorphic to G = SL(2, R).\ne, g\ne) such that, up to a finite cover,\nThen, there exists a Riemannian manifold (N\ne\ne, g\ne) \u00d7 G. Here, G\nM is a quotient of X = N \u00d7 G by a subgroup \u0393 of Iso(N\nis endowed with the bi-invariant Lorentzian metric defined by the Killing form of\ne \u00d7G may be warped rather than a direct product. Any\nSL(2, R) and the metric of N\nisometry of X that normalizes the G-action on X is the product of an isometry a\ne , and an isometry of G of the form (b, c) \u2208 G \u00d7 G, with b acting\nof the first factor N\nby right multiplication and c by left multiplication on G. When the metric of X\nis warped, then a must preserve the warping function. We will denote by (a, b, c)\nsuch an isometry of X.\nThe fundamental group \u0393 commutes with the G-action, and therefore its elements have the form (a, b, 1), for they must commute with all elements of the form\n(1, 1, c). One can define a Riemannian metric on X by replacing the Lorentz metric\nof the factor G with a right invariant Riemannian metric on G, that will be denoted\nby m. By construction, such a new Riemannian metric on X is preserved by \u0393,\nthus it descends to a Riemannian metric h on M . Now, the map (a, b, c) 7\u2192 (a, b)\ndefines a homomorphism\n\u03c6 : Iso(M, g) \u2212\u2192 Iso(M, h),\nwhose kernel is exactly G. Observe however that Iso(M, h) is compact, but \u03c6\nmay not be onto. Denote by H1 the closed subgroup of Iso(M, h) consisting of\nelements that preserve the foliation of M determined by G. This is a closed subgroup, and all its elements have the split form (a, d), where d \u2208 Iso(G, m).\nNow, Iso(G, m) contains G (acting by right multiplication), but it may be strictly\nlarger than G when the isotropy group of (G, m) is non trivial, and a further reduction is needed. More precisely, let e1 , e2 , e3 be a basis of the Lie algebra of G, and\nlet E1 , E2 , E3 be the corresponding vector fields on M . Denote by H2 the closed\nsubgroup of H1 consisting of isometries f \u2208 Iso(M, h) such that f\u2217 Ei = Ei ,\ni = 1, 2, 3. The lift to X of such an isometry f has the form (a, b, 1), thus we have\nan exact sequence 1 \u2192 G \u2192 Iso(M, g) \u2192 H2 \u2192 1. Since H2 is compact, it has a\nfinite number of connected components. Moreover, G is connected, it follows that\nIso(M, g) has the same number of connected components as H2 , and we are done.\nThe case where Iso0 (M, g) contains an oscillator group is treated following the\nsame arguments.\n\u0003\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n15\n\n4.2. A further compactness result.\nLemma 4.2. Let G be a Lie group acting on a manifold R, and let G0 be a compact\nnormal subgroup of G all of whose orbits in R have the same dimension. Then:\n\u2022 the distribution \u2206 tangent to the G0 -orbits is smooth, and it is preserved\nby G;\n\u2022 there exists a Riemannian metric h0 on \u2206 which is preserved by G0 and\nby the centralizer Centr(G0 ) of G0 in G.\nProof. Introduce the following notation: for x \u2208 R, let \u03b2x : G \u2192 R be the map\n\u03b2x (g) = g * x, and let Lx : g \u2192 Tx M be its differential at the identity. Here g\nis the Lie algebra of G. The map M \u00d7 g \u220b (x, v) 7\u2192 Lx (v) \u2208 T M is a smooth\nvector bundle morphism from the trivial bundle M \u00d7 g to T M . The distribution\n\u2206 is the image of the sub-bundle M \u00d7 g0 , where g0 \u2282 g is the Lie algebra of G0 .\nSince the orbits of G0 have the same dimension, then the image of M \u00d7 g0 is a\nsmooth sub-bundle of T M (recall that the image of a vector bundle morphism is a\nsmooth sub-bundle if it has constant rank). The action of G preserves \u2206 because\nG0 is normal, which concludes the proof of the first assertion.\nThe construction of h0 goes as follows. Choose a positive definite inner product B on g0 which is AdG0 -invariant; the existence of such B follows from the\ncompactness of G0 . For all x \u2208 R, the restriction to g0 of Lx gives a surjection\nLx |g0 : g0 \u2192 \u2206x ; denote by Vx the B-orthogonal complement of the kernel of\nthis map, given by Ker(Lx |g0 ) = Ker(Lx ) \u2229 g0 . The value of h0 on \u2206x is defined to be the push-forward via the map Lx of the restriction of B to Vx . In order\nto see that such metric is invariant by the action of G0 and of its centralizer, for\ng \u2208 G denote by Ig : G0 \u2192 G0 the conjugation by g (recall that G0 is normal)\nand by \u03b3g : M \u2192 M the diffeomorphism x 7\u2192 g * x; for fixed x \u2208 M we have a\ncommutative diagram:\nG0\n\nIg\n\n/ G0\n\u03b2gx\n\n\u03b2x\n\n\u000f\n\nM\n\n\u000f\n\u03b3g\n\n/M\n\nDifferentiating at the identity the diagram above we get:\ng0\n\nAdg\n\n/ g0\nLg*x\n\nLx\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\n\u2206x\n\nd\u03b3g (x)\n\n/ \u2206g*x\n\nNow assume that g is such that Adg preserves B; this holds by assumption when\ng \u2208 G0 , and clearly also for g in the centralizer of G\n\u0001 0 (in which case Adg is\nthe identity!). For such a g, since Adg Ker(Lx ) \u2229 g0 = Ker(Lg*x ), then also\nAdg (Vx ) = Vg*x , and thus we have a commutative diagram:\nVx\n\nAdg\n\n/ Vg*x\nLg*x\n\nLx\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\n\u2206x\n\nd\u03b3g (x)\n\n/ \u2206g*x\n\n,\n\n\f16\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nfrom which it follows that d\u03b3g (x) preserves the metric h0 , proving the last statement in the thesis.\n\u0003\nLet us now assume throughout that (M, g) is a compact Lorentzian manifold that\nadmits a Killing vector field K which is timelike somewhere, and with Iso0 (M, g)\ncompact. To simplify notations, let us set G = Iso(M, g), G0 = Iso0 (M, g),\ng = Iso(M, g), Aut(G0 ) the group of automorphisms of G0 , Inn(G0 ) the normal subgroup of inner automorphisms of G0 , and Out(G0 ) = Aut(G0 )/Inn(G0 ).\nSince G0 is normal in G, then G acts by conjugation on G0 , and we have a homomorphism G \u2192 Aut(G0 ), and composing with the quotient map we have a\nhomomorphism:\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c1 : G \u2212\u2192 Out(G0 ),\n\nwhose kernel G1 = Ker(\u03c1) is the product G0 * Centr(G0 ).\nProposition 4.3. G1 is compact.\nProof. Let R be the (non empty) open subset of M consisting of all points x whose\nG0 -orbit O(x) has maximal dimension (among all G0 -orbits), and such that O(x)\nis timelike, i.e., the restriction of g to O(x) is Lorentzian. Recall that the set\nof points whose G0 -orbit has maximal dimension is open and dense, and R is\nthe intersection of this dense open subset with the open subset of M where K is\ntimelike. We claim that there exists a Riemannian metric h on R which is preserved\nby G1 . Such a metric h is constructed as follows: on the distribution \u2206 tangent\nto the G0 -orbits is given by the metric h0 as in Lemma 4.2, on the g-orthogonal\ndistribution \u2206\u2032 it is the (positive definite) restriction of g, furthermore \u2206 and \u2206\u2032\nare declared to be h-orthogonal. Note that the distributions \u2206 and \u2206\u2032 are preserved\nby G, the metric g on \u2206\u2032 is preserved by all elements of g, and the metric h0 on \u2206\nis preserved by all elements of G1 , which proves our claim.\nObserve that G1 is closed in G. Using the precompactness criterion, in order\nto prove the compactness of G1 it suffices to show that G1 leaves some compact\nsubset of R invariant. If d is the dimension of the principal G0 -orbits, let vold\ndenote d-dimensional volume induced by \u0001the Lorentzian restriction of g on the\nG0 -orbits in R. Set a = sup vold O(x) , and let T the compact subset of M\nx\u2208M\n\u0001\nconsisting of all points x such that vold O(x) = a. Note that the volume function\nis lower semi-continuous, see Lemma 4.4 below, and it admits maximum in the\ncompact set of all G0 -orbits, so \u0001that a is well defined and T is not empty. Moreover,\nsince the condition vold O(x) \u2265 a is closed, then T is compact. Clearly, T is\ncontained in R, and it is preserved by G1 . This concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nWe have used the following result, which has some interest in its own:\nLemma 4.4. Let G be a compact Lie group that acts smoothly by isometries on a\nLorentzian manifold (L, gL ) in such a way that:\n(a) all the G-orbits have the same dimension;\n(b) every G-orbit is timelike, i.e., the restriction of the metric gL to each orbit\nis Lorentzian.\nThen, the function L \u220b x 7\u2192 volx \u2208 R is lower semi-continuous, where volx denotes the volume of the orbit O(x) relative to the volume induced by the restriction\nto O(x) of the Lorentzian metric gL .\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n17\n\nProof. By standard result on group actions (see for instance [6]), through every\nx \u2208 L there is a slice for the action of G, i.e., a smooth submanifold Sx \u2282 L\ncontaining x that has (among others) the following properties:\n(1) the map G \u00d7 Sx \u220b (g, y) 7\u2192 g * y \u2208 L is open;\n(2) denoting by Gx the isotropy of x, if g 6\u2208 Gx then g * Sx \u2229 Sx = \u2205.\nBy (1), if V \u2282 Sx is a neighborhood of x in Sx , then G * V is a neighborhood of x\nin L; thus, since the function volume is constant on each orbit, it suffices to show\nthat the map Sx \u220b y 7\u2192 voly \u2208 R is lower semi-continuous.\nBy (2), if y \u2208 Sx , then Gy \u2282 Gx . Let H \u2282 \u0001Gx be the identity\n\u0001 connected\ncomponent of Gx . By assumption (a), dim O(y) = dim O(x) , from which\nit follows that H is contained in Gy . We therefore have a well defined map \u03b2 :\nG/H \u00d7 Sx \u2192 L, given by \u03b2(gH, y) = g * y. This map is smooth, because q :\nG\u00d7 Sx \u2192 (G/H)\u00d7 Sx is a smooth surjective submersion, and \u03b2 \u25e6q : G\u00d7 Sx \u2192 L\nis smooth.\nFr y \u2208 Sx , consider the smooth map \u03b2 y : G/H \u2192 L defined by \u03b2 y (gH) =\n\u03b2(gH, y); its image is given by the embedded submanifold O(y), thus we have\na smooth map \u03b2 y : G/H \u2192 O(y). Such map is a finite covering, with folding (cardinality of the fiber) equal to Gy /H . Namely, \u03b2 y can be written as the\ncomposition of the diffeomorphism G/Gy \u220b gGy 7\u2192 g * y \u2208 O(y) with the covering map G/H \u2192 G/Gy . The latter is a smooth fibration, with discrete fiber,\nhence a covering map, with folding equal to Gy /H (see for instance [12, Proposition 2.1.14]).\nIt follows that the map \u03b2 y : G/H \u2192 L is an immersion (composition of an\nimmersion and a local diffeomorphism), and we obtain a symmetric (0, 2)-tensor\n\u2217\non G/H given by the pull-back gy = \u03b2 y (gL ). In fact, we have a smoothly varying\nfamily Sx \u220b y 7\u2192 gy of symmetric (0, 2)-tensors on G/H. Such tensors are\nnondegenerate and Lorentzian, in fact gy is also given as the pull-back by the\ncovering map \u03b2 y : G/H \u2192 O(y) of the restriction to O(y) of gL . It follows that\nthe volume of G/H relatively to the metric gy , which is a continuous function of\ny (volume relative to a continuous family of measures), is equal to Gy /H voly .\nThe desired semi-continuity property of the function y 7\u2192 voly follows now\neasily observing that for y \u2208 Sx , Gy \u2282 Gx , thus Gy /H voly \u2264 Gx /H voly . \u0003\n5. T HE TORAL\n\nFACTOR\n\nWe will now pursue the study of the action of subgroups of the isometry group\nof M . The idea is to consider a suitable reduction of Iso(M, g), i.e., a closed subgroup G \u2282 Iso(M, g) such that, denoting by G0 its identity connected component,\nthe following properties are satisfied:\n\n(5.1)\n\nG is non compact,\nG0 is compact,\nG0 has some timelike orbit.\n\nWe observe that (5.1) is preserved by passing to finite index subgroups of G.\nNamely, if G\u2032 \u2282 G has finite index, then it is closed, non compact, and it has\nthe same connected component of the identity as G.\n\n\f18\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\n5.1. Reduction of G0 . Recall the homomorphism \u03c1 : G \u2192 Out(G0 ) in (4.1); by\nProposition 4.3, G1 = Ker(\u03c1) is compact, and in particular \u03c1(G) is non compact.\nIf G0 has an almost decomposition Tk \u00d7 K, where K is semisimple, then the\nimage of \u03c1 is contained in Out(Tk ) = GL(k, Z).\nSince K is normal, we have a representation r : G \u2192 Aut(K); let G\u2032 be its\nkernel, which is the centralizer of K in G. One can see that G/G\u2032 = K/Centr(K).\nIndeed, since Aut(K) = Int(K), for any f \u2208 G, there exists k \u2208 K such that\nr(f ) = r(k), that is, f k\u22121 \u2208 G\u2032 . Therefore, G/G\u2032 is a quotient of K. This\nquotient is easily identified with K/Centr(K).\nIn some sense, going from G to G\u2032 allows one to kill the semi-simple factor, that\nis to assume that the identity component is a torus, and that the discrete part G/G0\nhas not changed. More precisely, let us now describe how to \"forget\" the semisimple factor K keeping the identity component with somewhere timelike orbits. Let\nX be a somewhere timelike Killing field. The closure of its flow is a product (possibly trivial) of two tori, K1 \u00d7 K2 , where K1 (resp., K2 ) is a subgroup of Tk (resp.,\nof K). Since G\u2032 centralizes K2 , we have a direct product group G\u2032 \u00d7 K2 .\nSummarizing, we have proven the following:\nLemma 5.1. There is a subgroup G of Iso(M, g) satisfying (5.1) and having an\nabelian identity component G0 = Tk .\nWith such reduction of the group G, we can now consider the action of G on\nG0 \u223c\n= Tk given by the representation \u03c1 : G \u2192 Out(Tk ) = GL(k, Z); in order to\ndistinguish the action of G on M and on Tk , we will call the latter the \u03c1-action.\nCorollary 5.2. Up to a finite index reduction, the quotient group \u0393 = G/G0 is\ntorsion free, i.e., all its non trivial elements have infinite order.\nProof. Choose any torsion free finite index subgroup H of GL(k, Z) (it exists by\nSelberg lemma [2]), and set G\u2032 = \u03c1\u22121 (H). This is a finite index torsion-free\nsubgroup of G.\n\u0003\n5.2. Preliminary properties of the Tk -action.\nLemma 5.3. The Tk -action on M is locally free on a dense open set.\nProof. It follows immediately from Corollary 2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.4. After replacing G by a finite index subgroup, the \u03c1-action on Tk preserves some Lorentz metric. In particular, one can see \u03c1(G) as lying in GL(k, Z)\u2229\nSO(q), where q is a Lorentz form on Rk .\nProof. The \u03c1-action of G on G0 \u223c\n= Tk by conjugation induces an action of G on\nk\nthe space sym(R ) of symmetric bilinear forms on Rk . By (2.3), the compact\nsubset given by the image of the Gauss map G is invariant by this action; moreover,\nthe image of the Lebesgue measure of M by the Gauss map is also invariant by\n\u03c1(G). Such compact subset contains a non empty open subset consisting of Lorentz\nforms, because G0 has timelike orbits in M . By Corollary 2.9, there exists a finite\nindex subgroup of H \u2032 of \u03c1(G) that preserves some Lorentz form on Rk . The\ndesired finite index subgroup of G is \u03c1\u22121 (H \u2032 ).\n\u0003\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n6.

Up to a compact\nnormal subgroup, Gf is cyclic, which justifies the name almost cyclic. One can\nprove:\nLemma 6.1. G = Gf is a closed subgroup of Iso(M, g) satisfying (5.1). It is\nisomorphic to a semi-direct product Z \u22c9 Tk .\nLemma 6.2. If A \u2208 GL(k, Z)\nequivalent to:\n\uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n\nis parabolic, then some power of A is rationally\n\uf8f6\nt \u2212t2 /2\n1\nt\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0\n1\n0\nIdk\u22123\n\nThis means that the subspaces {e1 }, {e1 , e2 }, {e1 , e2 , e3 } and {e4 , . . . , ek } are\nrational.\nIn particular, there is an A-invariant rational 3-space, on whose orthogonal,\nwhich is not necessarily rational, the A-action is trivial.\nProof. The proof is quite standard. Let A have the normal form above. Consider\nE the kernel of (A \u2212 1)3 , which is a rational subspace, and it contains the subspace\nE0 = {e1 , e2 , e3 }. On E/E0 , A is elliptic, but since it satisfies (A \u2212 1)3 = 0, its\neigenvalues are roots of 1. More precisely, replacing A by a A3 , we can assume\nthat A is trivial on its elliptic subspace in E.\nSince E is rational, A determines an integer matrix in GL(Rk /E). This is an\nelliptic matrix. So, all the eigenvalues of A are roots of unity, and therefore, after\npassing to a power, we can assume that 1 is the unique eigenvalue of A.\nConsider A \u2212 1 and (A \u2212 1)2 . Their images are, respectively, the 2-plane generated by {e1 , e3 } and the line Re1 . These two subspaces are thus rational.\nThe 1-eigenspace of A is generated by {e1 , e4 , . . . , ek }. It is rational. We can\nchoose e4 , . . . ek rational. For e3 , one can take any rational vector which does not\nbelong to the space generated by {e1 , e2 , e4 , . . . , ek }.\n\u0003\n6.1. Structure Theorem.\nTheorem 6.3. Let f \u2208 Iso(M, g) act non-periodically on Iso0 (M, g). Then, there\nis a minimal timelike \u03c1(f )-invariant torus Td \u2282 Iso0 (M, g) of dimension d = 3\nor d \u2265 2 according to whether \u03c1(f ) is parabolic or hyperbolic, respectively. The\naction of Td on M is (everywhere) free and timelike.\nWe will present the proof of the theorem in the parabolic case; the hyperbolic\ncase is analogous, in fact, easier. So, let f be such that \u03c1(f ) is parabolic. The\n3-torus Td = T3 in question is the one corresponding to the rational 3-space associated to A in Lemma 6.2. The normal form of \u03c1(f ) on this rational 3-space\nis:\n\uf8eb\n2\uf8f6\n1 t \u2212 t2\n(6.1)\n\u03c1(f ) \u223c\n= \uf8ed0 1\nt \uf8f8 , t 6= 0.\n0 0 1\n\n\f20\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nWe need to show that this torus acts freely with timelike orbits on M , and the idea\nis to relate the dynamics of f on M and the dynamics of \u03c1(f ) on the toral factor. Towards this goal, we will use the approximately stable foliation of a Lorentz\nisometry, introduced in reference [18].\n6.2. Recalls on approximate stability. Let \u03c6 be a diffeomorphism of a compact manifold M . A vector v \u2208 Tx M is called approximately stable if there is\na sequence vn \u2208 Tx M , vn \u2192 v such that the sequence Dx \u03c6n vn is bounded in\nT M . The vector v is called strongly approximately stable if Dx \u03c6n vn \u2192 0. The\nset of approximately stable vectors in Tx M is denoted AS(x, \u03c6), or sometimes\nAS(x, \u03c6, M ). Their union over M is denoted AS(\u03c6), or AS(\u03c6, M ). Similarly,\nSAS(x, \u03c6) will S\ndenote that set of strongly approximately stable vectors in Tx M ,\nand SAS(\u03c6) = x\u2208M SAS(x, \u03c6).\nThe structure of AS(\u03c6) when \u03c6 is a Lorentzian isometry has been studied in\n[18]:\nTheorem 6.4 (Zeghib [18]). Let \u03c6 be an isometry of a compact Lorentz manifold\n(M, g) such that the powers {\u03c6n }n\u2208N of \u03c6 form an unbounded set (i.e., non precompact in Iso(M, g)). Then:\n\u2022 AS(\u03c6) is a Lipschitz condimension 1 vector subbundle of T M which is\ntangent to a condimension 1 foliation of M by geodesic lightlike hypersurfaces;\n\u2022 SAS(\u03c6) is a Lipschitz 1-dimensional subbundle of T M contained in AS(\u03c6)\nand everywhere lightlike.\n6.3. The action on M vs the toral action. Denote by T the Lie algebra of T3 ,\nand by \u03c10 (f ) the linear representation in associated to \u03c1(f ). More explicitly, \u03c10 (f )\nis the push-forward by f of Killing vector fields, see formula (2.1).\nLemma 6.5. Let X \u2208 T , be a Killing field which is approximately stable for \u03c1(f )\nat 1 \u2208 T3 . Then, for all x \u2208 M , X(x) \u2208 Tx M is approximately stable. In other\nwords, if X \u2208 AS(0, \u03c10 (f ), T ), then X(x) \u2208 AS(x, f, M ) for any x \u2208 M .\nA totally analogous statement holds for the strong approximate stability.\nProof. Let Xn be a sequence of Killing fields in T such that Xn \u2192 X and with\nYn = f\u2217n Xn bounded. Clearly Xn (x) \u2192 X(x) for all x \u2208 M ; moreover, by\nassumption, the Yn are bounded vector fields, and so Dx f n Xn (x) = Yn (f n x) is\nbounded, that is X(x) \u2208 AS(f ).\n\u0003\nLemma 6.6. Assume \u03c1(f ) parabolic. Then, there is Z \u2208 T a Killing field such\nthat\n(a) Z defines a periodic flow \u03c6t ;\n(b) f preserves Z, i.e., f commutes with the 1-parameter group of isometries\n\u03c6t generated by Z;\n(c) Z generates the strong approximate stable 1-dimensional bundle of f ;\n(d) Z is everywhere isotropic;\n(e) Z is non-singular, hence Z is everywhere lightlike.\nProof. Let Z to be a 1-eigenvector of \u03c1(f ); since \u03c10 (f )Z = f\u2217 Z = Z, then f\npreserves Z. In the normal form (6.1) of \u03c1(f ), the vector Z corresponds to the first\nelement of the basis.\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n21\n\nThe Z-direction is rational, since it is the unique 1-eigendirection of \u03c10 (f ). Thus\nZ defines a periodic flow.\nOne verifies that Z is strongly approximately stable for the \u03c10 (f )-action at 0 \u2208\nT . Therefore, at any x where it does not vanish, Z(x) determines the strongly\nstable 1-dimensional bundle of f . In particular, Z(x) is isotropic for all x \u2208 M .\nBut, non trivial isotropic Killing field cannot have singularities.\n\u0003\n6.4. Proof of Theorem 6.3 (parabolic case).\nLemma 6.7. T3 preserves the approximate stable foliation F of f .\nProof. The group Gf generated by T3 and f is amenable (it is an extension of the\nabelian T3 by the abelian Z). The statement follows then from [18, Theorem 2.4,\nTheorem 2.6].\n\u0003\nLemma 6.8. The T3 -action is locally free.\nProof. Let \u03a3 be the set of points x having a stabilizer Sx of positive dimension. We\nclaim that if \u03a3 is non empty, then there must be some point of \u03a3 whose stabilizer\ncontains the flow \u03c6t of the vector field Z given in Lemma 6.6. This is clearly a\ncontradiction, because such Z has no singularity.\n\b\nIn order to prove the claim, consider the set \u03a32 = x \u2208 M : dim(Sx ) = 2 .\nThis is a closed subset of M , because 2 is the highest possible dimension of the\nstabilizers of the T3 -action. If \u03a32 is non empty, then there exists an f -invariant\nmeasure on \u03a32 , and by Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem there is at least one recurrent\npoint x0 \u2208 \u03a32 . The Lie algebra sx0 of Sx0 is then \u03c1(f )-recurrent, and since \u03c1(f )\nis parabolic, by Lemma 2.5 (applied to the \u03c1(f )-action on the Grassmannian of 2planes in T ), then sx0 is fixed by \u03c1(f ). There is only one 2-plane fixed by \u03c1(f ) in\nT (the one spanned by the first two vector of the basis that puts \u03c1(f ) in the normal\nform), and such plane contains Z.\n\b\nSimilarly, if \u03a32 is empty, then \u03a31 = x \u2208 M : dim(Sx ) = 1 is closed in M .\nAs above, there must be a recurrent point x0 in \u03a31 , and sx0 is fixed by \u03c1(f ). This\nimplies that sx0 contains Z.\nThe proof is concluded.\n\u0003\nLemma 6.9. The T3 -action is everywhere timelike.\nProof. If not, there exists x \u2208 M such that the restriction gx of the metric g to\nTx T3 x \u223c\n= T is lightlike, i.e., positive semi-definite (note that the Z is a lightlike\nvector of such restriction, \bthat cannot be positive definite). Consider the f -invariant\ncompact subset M+ = x \u2208 M : gx is positive semi-definite ; it has an f invariant measure, and by Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem there is a recurrent point\nx0 \u2208 M+ for f . Also the metric gx0 on T is \u03c1(f )-recurrent, and by Lemma 2.5\n(applied to the \u03c1(f )-action on the space of quadratic forms on T ), gx0 is fixed\nby \u03c1(f ). But there exists no non zero \u03c1(f )-invariant quadratic form on T whose\nkernel is Z. This is proved with an elementary computation using the normal form\n(6.1) of \u03c1(f ).\n\u0003\n7. A\n\nGENERAL COVERING LEMMA\n\nLet us now go back to the general case where \u03c1(f ) is either parabolic or hyperbolic, and proceed with the study of the geometrical structure of M . The product\nstructure of (a finite covering of) M willbe established using a general covering\nresult.\n\n\f22\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\nProposition 7.1. Let M be a compact manifold, and let X be a non singular vector\nfield on M of the manifold R \u00d7 N0 generating an equicontinuous flow \u03c6t (i.e., \u03c6t\npreserves some Riemannian metric). Assume there exists a codimension 1 foliation\nN such that:\n- N is everywhere transverse to X;\n- N is preserved by \u03c6t .\nThen, X and N defines a global product structure in the universal cover M\u0303 . More\nprecisely, let x0 \u2208 M and let N0 be its N -leaf. Then, the map p : R \u00d7 N0 \u2192 M\ndefined by p(t, x) = \u03c6t x is a covering.\nA generalization is available for some group actions. Namely, consider an action of a compact Lie group K on a compact manifold M such that:\n- the action is locally free (in particular, all orbits have the same dimension);\n- K preserves a foliation N transverse to its orbits (with a complementary\ndimension).\nThen, for all x0 \u2208 M , denoting by by N0 the leaf of N through x0 , the map\np : K \u00d7 N0 \u2192 M defined by p(g, x) = gx is an equivariant3 covering.\nProof. In order to prove the first statement, consider the set of Riemannian metrics\nfor which X and N are orthogonal, and X has norm equal to 1. The equicontinuity\nassumption implies that the \u03c6t 's generate a precompact subgroup \u03a6 of the diffeomorphisms group of M . By averaging over the compact group \u03a6, one obtains a\nmetric g\u2217 on M which is preserved by \u03c6t . Now, endow R \u00d7 N0 with the product\nmetric, where R is endowed with the Euclidean metric dt2 and N0 has the induced\nmetric from g\u2217 . Observe that the induced metric on N0 is complete (leaves of foliations in compact manifolds have bounded geometry, i.e., they are complete, have\nbounded curvature and injectivity radius bounded from below). One then observes\nthat p is a local isometry; namely, R\u00d7N0 is complete, and therefore p is a covering.\nFor the second statement, one can choose a left-invariant Riemannian metric h\non K, and taking an average on K one obtains a K-invariant Riemannian metric\ng\u2217 on M such that:\n(a) the K-orbits and the leaves of N are everywhere orthogonal;\n(b) the map K \u220b k 7\u2192 kx0 \u2208 Kx0 is a local isometry when the orbit Kx0 is\nendowed with the Riemannian metric induced by g\u2217 .\nAs above, with such a choice the equivariant map p : K \u00d7 N0 \u2192 M defined by\np(k, x) = kx is a local isometry, and since K \u00d7 N0 is complete, p is a covering\nmap.\n\u0003\n8. O N\n\nTHE PRODUCT STRUCTURE : THE HYPERBOLIC CASE\n\nLet us now assume that \u03c1(f ) is hyperbolic; in this section we will denote by T\nthe torus Td \u2282 G0 given in Theorem 6.3.\nLemma 8.1. The orthogonal distribution N to the T-foliation is integrable.\nProof. Let N be the quotient of M by the T-action, and \u03c0 : M \u2192 N the projection. It is a compact Riemanian orbifold. The f -action induces an isometry g\nof N . Consider the Levi form (i.e., the integrability tensor of the distribution N )\nl : N \u00d7 N \u2192 N \u22a5 . Observe that N \u22a5 is the tangent bundle of the T-foliation.\n3The action of K on K \u00d7 N is the left multiplication on the first factor.\n0\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n23\n\nLet X an Y be two vector fields on N . Suppose they are g-invariant: g\u2217 X =\nX and g\u2217 Y = Y . Let X\u0304 and \u0232 their horizontal lifts on M . Then, f\u2217 X\u0304 = X\u0304\nand f\u2217 \u0232 = \u0232 . Hence, l(X\u0304, \u0232 ) is an f -invariant vector field tangent to the Tfoliation. However, by definition of the minimal torus T, the \u03c1(f )-action on it has\nno invariant vector field. This means l(X\u0304, \u0232 ) = 0.\nThis proof will be finished thanks to the following fact.\n\u0003\nProposition 8.2. Let g be an isometry of a Riemannian manifold N . There is an\nopen dense set U such that for any x \u2208 U , any vector u \u2208 Tx U can be extended\nlocally to a g-invariant vector field.\nProof. The closure of {gn , n \u2208 Z} in the isometry group of N is a compact group\nwith a torus as identity connected component. Apply Corollary 2.4 to conclude\nthat, for the associated isometric action on N , the isotropy group is trivial on an\nopen dense set U . Given x \u2208 U and v \u2208 Tx N , extend first u to an arbitrary smooth\nvector field on the slice through x of the S-action, and then extend to U using the\nS-action.\n\u0003\nWe will now prove the compactness of the leaves of N .\nLemma 8.3. Let N0 be a leaf of N . Then, N0 is compact.\nProof. The distribution N can be seen as a connection on the T-principal bundle\nM \u2192 N . We have just proved that this connection is flat, i.e., N is integrable,\nwhich is equivalent to the fact that its holonomy group is discrete. The leaves will\nbe compact if we prove that the holonomy group is indeed finite; for x \u2208 N , we\nwill denote by Tx the fiber at x of the principal bundle M \u2192 N . Recall that if c is\na loop at x \u2208 N , then the holonomy map H(c) : Tx \u2192 Tx is obtained by means of\nhorizontal lifts of c. It commutes with the T-action and therefore it is a translation\nitself. In fact, H(c) can be seen as an element of the acting torus T (and so, it is\nindependent on the base point x). We have a holonomy map H : \u03c01 (N, x) \u2192 T. In\nfact, since T is commutative, we have canonical identification of holonomy maps\ndefined on different base points. In other words H(c) = H(c\u2032 ), whence c and c\u2032\nare freely homotopic curves.\nUp to replacing f by some power, we can assume that the basic Riemannian\nisometry g : N \u2192 N is in the identity component of Iso(N ) (since this group is\ncompact).\n\u0001 Therefore, any loop c is freely homotopic to g(c), and hence H(c) =\nH g(c) .\nNow, f preserves all the structure, and thus if c\u0303 is a\u0001horizontal lift of c, then f \u25e6 c\u0303\nis a horizontal lift of g(c). So, f H(c)f \u22121 = H g(c) . If g(c) is freely homotopic\nto c, then H(c) is a fixed point of \u03c1(f ). But we know that that \u03c1(f ) has only\nfinitely many fixed points (by the definition of T). Therefore, the holonomy group\nis finite.\n\u0003\nApply now Proposition 7.1 to deduce that M is covered by a product T\u00d7N0 \u2192 M .\nThe covering is finite because N0 is compact.\nObserve that we can assume the leaf N0 is f -invariant. Indeed, the leaf N0 meets\nall the fibers Tx , and, say, it contains x\u0303 \u2208 Tx . So after composing with a suitable\ntranslation t \u2208 T, i.e., replacing f by t \u25e6 f , we can assume that f (x\u0303) \u2208 N0 . This\nimplies that f (N0 ) = N0 . Summarizing, all things (the T-action and f ) can be\nlifted to the finite cover T \u00d7 N0 .\n\n\f24\n\nP. PICCIONE AND A. ZEGHIB\n\n8.1. The metric. The Lorentz metric g is not necessarily a product of the Riemannian metric on N0 by that of T2 . It is true that T2 and N are g-orthogonal.\nAlso, two leaves {t} \u00d7 N and {t\u2032 } \u00d7 N are isometric, via the T2 -action. However,\nthe metric induced on each T2 \u00d7 {n} may vary with n. Observe however that\none can choose a same metric for all these toral orbits, of course keeping the same\ninitial group acting isometrically.\n8.2. The non-elementary case. Let \u0393 be a discrete subgroup of SO(1, k \u2212 1). Its\nlimit set L\u0393 in the sphere (boundary at infinity of the hyperbolic space Hk\u22121 ). The\ngroup \u0393 is elementary parabolic if L\u0393 has cardinality equal to 1, and elementary\nhyperbolic if L\u0393 has cardinality equal to 2. It is known that if \u0393 is not elementary,\nthen L\u0393 is infinite, and the action of \u0393 on L\u0393 is minimal, i.e., every orbit is dense,\nsee [14].\nIf \u0393 elementary hyperbolic, then \u0393 is virtually a cyclic group, i.e., up to a finite\nindex, it consists of powers An of the same hyperbolic element element A. If \u0393 is\nelementary parabolic, then it is virtually a free abelian group of rank d \u2264 k \u2212 2,\ni.e., it has a finite index subgroup isomorphic to Zd .\nOne fact on non-elementary groups is that they contain hyperbolic elements.\nMore precisely, the set of fixed points of hyperbolic elements in L\u0393 is dense in L\u0393 .\nAll the previous considerations in the case of a hyperbolic isometry f , extend to\nthe case of a non-elementary group. We get:\nTheorem 8.4. Let (M, g) be a compact Lorentz manifold with Iso(M, g) non compact, but Iso0 (M, g) compact, and let \u0393 be the discrete part Iso(M, g)/Iso0 (M, g).\nAssume that Iso0 (M, g) has some timelike orbit. Then, there is a torus Tk contained in Iso0 (M, g), invariant under the action by conjugacy of \u0393, and such that\nthe Tk -action is everywhere locally free and timelike.\nThe \u0393-action on Tk preserves some Lorentz metric on Tk , which allows one\nto identify \u0393 with a discrete subgroup of SO(1, k \u2212 1), as well as a subgroup of\nGL(k, Z).\nIf \u0393 is not elementary parabolic, then, up to a finite covering, M splits as a\ntopological product Tk \u00d7 N , where N is a compact Riemannian manifold. One\ncan modify the original metric g along the Tk orbits, and get a new metric gnew\nwith a larger isometry group, Iso(M, gnew ) \u2283 Iso(M, g), such that (M, gnew ) is\na pseudo-Riemannian direct product Tk \u00d7 N .\n9. O N\n\nTHE PRODUCT STRUCTURE : THE PARABOLIC CASE\n\nAs above, we have a T3 -principal fibration M \u2192 N over a Riemannian orbifold\nN , and N is seen as a connection. Let Z be the Killing field (as defined above),\nthat is the unique vector field which commutes with f .\nConsider the codimension 2 bundle L = N \u2295 RZ.\nLemma 9.1. L is integrable.\nProof. Let X and Y be two vector fields tangent to N . As in the proof above in\nthe hyperbolic case, we can choose X and Y to be f -invariant, see Proposition 8.2.\nTherefore, l(X, Y ) is also f -invariant, where l is the Levi form of N (not of L!).\nBut Z is the unique \u03c1(f )-invariant vector. Thus, l(X, Y ) is tangent to RZ.\nNow, consider the Lie bracket [X, Z]. The T3 -action preserves N , in particular,\n[Z, X] is tangent to N , for any X tangent to N . Consequently, L is integrable. \u0003\n\n\fCOMPACT LORENTZ MANIFOLDS WITH LARGE ISOMETRY GROUP\n\n25\n\nAs in the hyperbolic case, one can prove:\nLemma 9.2. The leaves of L are compact.\nOne can then apply Proposition 7.1 to L and any 2-dimensional torus T2 transverse to Z (L is invariant by T3 and so also by any such a T2 ). One obtainss that\nM is finitely covered by T2 \u00d7 L0 .\nHowever, since T2 is not f -invariant, this product is not compatible with f .\nAs in the hyperbolic case, we can choose L0 invariant by f . A slightly deeper\nanalysis shows that up to a finite cover M is an amalgamated product, i.e., a quotient (T3 \u00d7 L0 )/S1 , see Subsection 9.1 for details.\nThe metric structure of L0 is that of a lightlike manifold, that is L0 is endowed\nwith a positive semi-definite (degenerate) metric with a 1-dimensional null space.\nHere, the null space corresponds to the foliation defined by an S1 -action (the flow\nof the vector field Z). The circle S1 acts isometrically on the lightlike L0 and the\nLorentz T3 . A Lorentz metric can be defined on (L0 \u00d7 T3 )/S1 .\nWe have proven the following:\nTheorem 9.3. Let f be an isometry of a compact Lorentz manifold (M, g) such\nthat the action \u03c1(f ) on the toral component of Iso0 (M, g) is parabolic. Then,\nthere is a new metric on M having a larger isometry group such that M is the\namalgamated product of a Lorentz torus T3 , and a lightlike manifold L0 . Both\nhave an isometric S1 -action. The isometry f is obtained by means of a isometry h\nof L0 commuting with the S1 -action, and a linear isometry on the Lorentz T3 .\nThe same statement is valid if instead of a single parabolic f , we have an elementary parabolic group \u0393 of rank d. In this case, the torus has dimension 2 + d.\n9.1. Amalgamated products. Given any two manifolds X and Y carrying free\n(left) actions of the circle S1 , then one can consider the diagonal action of S1 on\nthe product X \u00d7 Y : g(x, y) = (gx, gy) for all g \u2208 S1 , x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y .\nLet Z be the quotient (X \u00d7 Y )/S1 of this diagonal action. Assume that X is\nLorentzian, Y is Riemannian, and the action of S1 in each manifold is isometric;\none can define a natural Lorentzian structure on Z as follows. Let A \u2208 X(X) and\nB \u2208 X(Y ) be smooth vector fields tangent to the fibers\u0002 of the S\u00031 -action on X and\non Y respectively; for (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 X \u00d7 Y , denote by (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 Z the S1 -orbit\n\b\n(gx0 , gy0 ) : g \u2208 S1 . The subspace Tx0 X \u2295 By\u22a50 is complementary to the onedimensional subspace spanned by (Ax0 , By0 ) in Tx0 X \u2295 Ty0 Y . If we denote by\nq : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Z the projection, then the linear map dq(x0 ,y0 ) : Tx0 X \u2295 Ty0 Y \u2192\n\u0001\u000e\nT[(x0 ,y0 )] Z \u223c\n= Tx0 X \u2295 Ty0 Y R * (Ax0 , By0 ) restricts to an isomorphism:\n\u223c\n=\n\ndq(x0 ,y0 ) : Tx0 X \u2295 By\u22a50 \u2212\u2192 T[(x0 ,y0 )] Z.\n\nA Lorentzian metric can be defined on Z by requiring that such isomorphism be\nisometric; in order to see that this is well defined, we need\u0002 to show\u0003that this definition is independent on the choice of (x0 , y0 ) in the orbit (x0 , y0 ) .

This shows\nthat the Lorentzian metric tensor on Z is well defined.\nAs to the topology of Z, we have the following:\nLemma 9.4. If X and Y are simply connected, then Z is simply connected. If the\nproduct of the fundamental groups \u03c01 (X) \u00d7 \u03c01 (Y ) is not a cyclic group, then Z is\nnot simply connected.\nProof. The diagonal S1 -action on X \u00d7 Y is free (and proper), and therefore the\nquotient map q : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Z is a smooth fibration. The thesis follows from\nan immediate analysis of the long exact homotopy sequence of the fibration, that\nreads:\nZ\u223c\n\u0003\n= \u03c01 (S1 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (X) \u00d7 \u03c01 (Y ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (Z) \u2212\u2192 \u03c00 (S1 ) \u223c\n= {1}.\n10. P ROOF\n\nOF\n\nC OROLLARY 3\n\nAND\n\nT HEOREM 4\n\nProof of Corollary 3. This is one of the steps of the proof of our structure result,\nsee Lemma 6.9.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 4. By the structure result of [17], compact Lorentzian manifolds\nadmitting an isometric action of (some covering of) SL(2, R) or of an oscillator group are not simply connected. Thus, if M is simply connected, by Theorem 3.1 Iso0 (M, g) is compact. Now, if Iso(M, g) has infinitely many connected components, then (a finite covering of) M is not simply connected. When\n\u0393 = Iso(M, g)/Iso0 (M, g) is not elementary parabolic, this follows directly from\nTheorem 8.4. When \u0393 is elementary parabolic, this follows from Theorem 9.3 and\nthe second statement of Lemma 9.4. Hence, Iso(M, g) is compact.\n\u0003\nR EFERENCES\n[1] S. A DAMS , G.
