An important\ntask now is an experimental determination of the quantum numbers of the\n\u0398+ . Model independent methods for determination of the P-parity of the pentaquark \u0398+ in the reaction NN \u2192 Y \u0398+ were suggested in Refs. [8,9,10,11].\nThese methods are based on such general properties of the reaction amplitude\nas angular momentum and P-parity conservation and on the generalized Pauli\nprinciple for nucleons. It was shown that the sign of the spin-spin correlation\nparameter Cy,y determines unambiguously the P-parity of the \u0398+ , \u03c0\u0398 , in the\nreaction pp \u2192 \u03a3+ \u0398+ [9]. Another strong correlation between Cy,y and \u03c0\u0398 is\nvalid also for the pn \u2192 \u039b0 \u0398+ reaction [10,11] if the isospin of the \u0398+ equals\nto zero. Furthermore, measurement of the spin transfer coefficients Kyy = Kxx\n\nor Kzz of these reactions also allow to determine the P-parity unambiguously\n[10,11]. A measurement of the polarization transfer from the initial nucleon\nto the hyperon in the reaction NN \u2192 Y \u0398+ can be perfomed by a single\nspin experiment with polarized beam or target, because the polarization of\nthe hyperon can be measured via its weak decay. However, the results of Refs.\n[8,9,10,11] are based on the assumption that the spin of the \u0398+ is equal to 21 .\nUp to now the spin of the \u0398+ is not known, as well as the P-parity and isospin,\nand within some models its value can be 23 . In this work we derive formulae for\nthe spin observables of the reaction NN \u2192 Y \u0398+ at the threshold for general\n\ncase of arbitrary spin of the \u0398+ . Analysis is based on common properties of\nthe reaction amplitude and the standard method of the spin-tensor operators\n[12]. We derive also a full spin structure of the cross section of this reaction\nfor the case of the spin- 21 particles taking into account all polarizations in the\ninitial an final states.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nFormalism\n\nAssuming dominance of the S-wave in the relative motion in the final system,\nthe most general expression for the amplitude of the binary reaction 1 + 2 \u2192\n3 + 4 at the threshold can be written as [13]\nT\u03bc\u03bc13\u03bc\u03bc24 =\n\nX\n\nJM\nS MS L m\n\n(j1 \u03bc1 j2 \u03bc2 |SMS )(j3 \u03bc3 j4 \u03bc4 |J M)(S MS L m|J M)YLm (k\u0302)aLS\nJ .\n(1)\n\nHere ji and \u03bci are the spin of the i-th particle and its z-projection, J and\nM are the total angular momentum and its z-projection; S and L are the\nspin and orbital momentum of the initial system, respectively, and MS and m\nare the corresponding z-projections. An information on the reaction dynamics\nis contained in the complex amplitudes aLJ S . The sum over J in Eq. (1) is\nrestricted by the conditions J = j3 + j4 , j3 + j4 \u2212 1, ..., |j3 \u2212 j4 |. We choose\nthe z-axis along the vector of the initial momentum k\u0302, therefore YLm (k\u0302) =\nq\n\n(2 L + 1)/4\u03c0 \u03b4m 0 . Due to P-parity conservation, the orbital momentum L in\n\nEq. (1) is restricted by the condition (\u22121)L = \u03c0, where \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 \u03c04 is the\nproduct of internal parities of the participating particles, \u03c0i . We consider here\n2\n\nmainly transitions without mixing the total isospin T in this reaction\n\n. For\n\nthe fixed T and \u03c0 the spin of the initial nucleons S is fixed unambiguously\nby the generalized Pauli principle: (\u22121)S = \u03c0(\u22121)T +1 . Therefore, in order to\ndetermine the P-parity \u03c0 of the system at given isospin T , it is sufficient to\ndetermine the spin of the NN-system in the initial state of this reaction.

Therefore, in contrast to the\ncase of S = 0, the spin-triplet initial state S = 1 allows a non-zero polarization\ntransfer in this reaction. In order to get the spin-transfer coefficients we use\nbelow a general method developed in Ref.[12].\n\n3\n\nGeneral method\n\nAccording to Ref.[12], the amplitude in Eq.(1) can be written as\n+\nT\u03bc\u03bc13\u03bc\u03bc24 = \u03c7+\nj3 \u03bc3 \u03c7j4 \u03bc4 F\u0302 \u03c7j1 \u03bc1 \u03c7j2 \u03bc2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere F\u0302 is an operator acting on the spin-states of the initial and final particles.

The operator F\u0302 is normalized\nto the unpolarized cross section as\nd\u03c30 =\n\n\u03a6\nSpF F + .\n(2j1 + 1) (2j2 + 1)\n\n(16)\n\n3.1 Polarizaton transfer coefficients\n\nThe spin-transfer coefficient is given by the following formula [12]\nK\u03bb\u03ba =\n\nSpF \u03c3\u03bb (1) F + \u03c3\u03ba (3)\n,\nSpF F +\n\nwhere \u03bb, \u03ba = 0, \u00b11.

We find also from Eq.(18) that\n\nthere is no polarization transfer (Kij = 0, i, j = x, y, z) for S = S \u2032 = 0 in\n\naccordance with above discussion. These coefficients equal to zero also for\nJ = J \u2032 = 0. For the spin-triplet transitions S = S \u2032 = 1, we find from Eq. (18)\nthat Kxx = Kyy 6= 0 and K00 = Kzz 6= 0.\nAs an example, let us consider the reaction with the minimal spins ji = 21 , i =\n1, ..., 4. For the total isospin T = 0 and parity \u03c0 = +1 one has got S = 1.

For the case of T = 1 \u03c0 = \u22121 one has got S = 1.

For higher spins of the 4-th particle\nj4 \u2265 32 , Eq.(18) also gives non-zero coefficients Kxx and Kzz , but the formulae\nare more cumbersome and thus we do not write them here.\n\n3.2 Spin-spin correlation coefficients\n\nFor the spin-spin correlation coefficient, defined as [14]\nC\u03bb \u03ba =\n\nSpF \u03c3\u03bb (1) \u03c3\u03ba (2) F +\n,\nSpF F +\n\nwe found for the case of j1 = j2 =\n\n(24)\n\n1\n2\n\nq\n3 X\n(\u22121)S+J (2J + 1) (2S + 1)(2S \u2032 + 1) \u00d7\n2\u03c0 S S \u2032 J\n\u221a\nX\n\u2032\n\u00d7\n(\u22121)L (2J0 + 1) 2L\u2032 + 1(1\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03bb |J0 0) (J0 0 L\u2032 0 |L 0) \u00d7\n\n4d\u03c30 C\u03bb,\u03ba = \u03b4\u03bb,\u2212\u03ba\n\nL L J0\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 S\u2032\n\n\u00d7\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nS\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nS\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nJ0 \uf8fd \uf8f2\n\nS\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 J0\n\nL L\u2032 J\n\n1 1\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\n\n1 1\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\naLJ S (aLJ \u2032 S )\u2217 .\n\n(25)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nWe found from Eq. (25) the following relations: C+1,\u22121 = C\u22121,+1 = \u2212Cx,x =\n\u2212Cy,y 6= 0, C00 = Czz 6= 0, whereas Ci,j = 0 at i 6= j (i, j = x, y, z).\n\nOne can see from Eq.(24) that the sum \u03a3 = Cx,x + Cy,y + Cz,z is equal to\n\u03c3(1) * \u03c3(2). Therefore \u03a3 is fixed by the spin S: \u03a3 = \u22123 for S = 0 and \u03a3 = +1\nfor S = 1 in accordance with the above results given in Eqs.(12), (13) and (6).\nOne can find from Eq.(25) that Cx,x = Cy,y = Cz,z = \u22121 for S = S \u2032 = 0. For\n\nS = S \u2032 = 1 we did not find here a transformation from the rather cumbersome\n\nformula (25) to more compact form of Eqs. (12) and (13). However, one can\ncheck by straightforward calculations that these formulae lead to the same\nresult for the spin-triplet initial state.\n8\n\n\f4\n\nFull spin structure for the reaction\n\n1\n2\n\n+\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2192\n\n1\n2\n\n+\n\n1\n2\n\nFor completeness, in this section we give the full spin structure of the binary\nreaction at j1 = j2 = j3 = j4 =\n\n1\n2\n\ndiscussed in part in Ref.[10]. For the case\n\nT = 0 and \u03c0 = \u22121 one has got S = 0, and the amplitude (1) can be written\nas\nM\u03bc\u03bc13 \u03bc\u03bc24\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1=x,y,z\n\ni\u03c3y\n(\u03c7+\n\u03bc3 \u03c3\u03b1 \u221a\n\n2\n\n\u2212i\u03c3y\n\u03c7\u03bc(T4 )+ ) (\u03c7\u03bc(T1 ) \u221a\n2\n\n\u03c7\u03bc2 )k\u0302\u03b1\n\ns\n\n3 10\na .\n4\u03c0 1\n\n(26)\n\nWhen deriving Eq.(26) from Eq.(1) we used for the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients the formulae given above after Eq.(2).

On the contrary, for S = 0, the spin-spin correlation coefficients\nCx,x = Cy,y = Cz,z equal to \u22121 and all the spin transfer coefficients equal to\nzero. This conclusion is a generalization of the previous results [10,11] found for\nthe case of j4 = 21 . The obtained result allows one to determine unambiguously\nthe P-parity of the \u0398+ by measurement of either Cy,y or Kxx (or Kzz ) in the\nreaction pp \u2192 \u03a3+ \u0398+ . The total isospin of this channel is fixed, T = 1,\ntherefore the spin S of the initial nucleons is directly related to the P-parity\n\u03c0\u0398 of the \u0398+ : (\u22121)S = \u03c0\u0398 . In the reaction pn \u2192 \u039b0 \u0398+ one has got either\n\n(\u22121)S = \u2212\u03c0\u0398 , if the isospin of the \u0398+ is even (I\u0398 = 0, 2), or (\u22121)S = \u03c0\u0398 ,\n\nif I\u0398 = 1. Therefore, both the P-parity and the isospin of the \u0398+ can be\n\ndetermined unambiguously by combined measurement of Cy,y or Kyy (or Kzz )\nin these two reactions.\nAcknowledgment.
