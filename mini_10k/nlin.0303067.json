Our method based on\nthe utilization of the symmetry operators and allows us to obtain the densities of arbitrary homogeneity dimensions. The non polynomial densities with\nlogarithmic behavior are presented as an example. The special attention is\npaid for the singular case (\u03b3 = 1) for which we found new non homogeneous\nsolutions expressed in terms of the elementary functions.\n\nIntroduction\nThe conservation laws are the most important object in the classical mechanics as\nwell as in the field theory. There are many different methods of the constructions\nof these laws. The most popular, especially used in the soliton theory and in the\nhydrodynamics, utilize the so called recursion operator or Lax operator formalism\n[1]. On the other hand, it appeared that for the Nonlinear Schroedinger equation\nit is possible to find one series of conserved Hamiltonians using recursion operator\nonly. However for the shallow water equation, which is the dispersionless limit of\nthe Nonlinear Schroedinger equation, there is additional series of conserved densities\nwhich is impossible to obtain by recursion operator (see for example [2]).\nIn this paper we would like to show that it is possible to construct new extra\nseries of conserved densities for the polytropic gas model and nonlinear elasticity\nequation [3, 4] avoiding using recursion operator or Lax formalism. More precisely\nwe generate many nonequivalent Hamiltonians of the given dimensions, using symmetry operator. Our Hamiltonians are non polynomial expressions which contains\nlogarithmic functions. Independently we consider the singular case, for the polytropic gas system for which (\u03b3 = 1) . For this system we constructed new series of\nnon homogeneous solutions expressed in terms of the elementary functions.\n1\n\n\fThe paper is organized as follows. In the first section we describe the basic\nproperties of the polytropic gas system which we use in the next sections. In the\nsecond section we describe our symmetry approach where we utilize the shift, scaling\nand projective operators in order to generate the conserved densities. In the third\nsection we present explicitly new series of the conserved densities for different, physically interesting, models of the polytropic gas system with \u03b3 = 2, 3, 4, 5, 53 , 57 , \u22121.\nIn the last section we adopt our formalism to the degenerated case (\u03b3 = 1) which is\nobtained from the contraction of the previous case. We show that in this case the\nconserved densities are connected with the Bessel equation.\n\n1\n\nThe hydrodynamical systems.\n\nThe theory of the hydrodynamical type systems of the nonlinear equations [5]\nuit =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c5ji (u)ujx\n\ni, j = 1, 2, ..., N\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere u = (u1 , u2 , ...uN ) and \u03c5ji are some functions , integrable by the generalized\nhodograph method [6] is closely related to the over-determined systems of first order\npartial differential linear equations. The conservation laws are such that\n\u2202h\n\u2202g\n=\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h is density and g is flux. Then densities satisfy\n\u2202k (\u2202i h) = \u0393iik (\u2202i h) + \u0393kik (\u2202k h). i 6= k,\nwhere\n\u0393iik \u2261\n\n\u2202k \u03bci\n\u03bck \u2212 \u03bci\n\n\u2202k \u2261 \u2202/\u2202r k\n\ni 6= k\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nand r k (u) are the so called Riemann invariants in which the hydrodynamic type\nsystem (1) is rewritten in the diagonal form\nrti = \u03bci (r)rxi ,\n\n(5)\n\nand no summation on the repeated indices. Thus, (3) is a linear systems of first\norder partial differential equations with variable coefficients. The general solution\nof such system is determined up to N arbitrary functions of a single variable.\nThere are many particular cases of the system (3) for which a general solution is\nexpressed in explicit and in compact form ([7]). If we cannot to find a general solution\nof such system, then alternative way to solve the Cauchy or Goursat problems is to\ncreate the infinite number of particular solutions [8].\nIt appeared that the conserved densities can be used in the construction of particular solutions. Indeed. Let us consider the polytropic gas\n\u03b7t = \u2202x (u\u03b7),\n\nut = \u2202x\n2\n\nh u2\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b7 \u03b3\u22121 i\n,\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n(6)\n\n\fand nonlinear elasticity equations\n\u03b7y = ux ,\n\nuy = \u2202x\n\nh\n\n\u03b7 \u03b3\u22122 i\n,\n\u03b3\u22122\n\n(7)\n\nwhich are the commuting flows to each other.\nThe solution of the first system obtained by hodograph method is\nt=h\u2212\u03b7\n\n\u2202h\n,\n\u2202\u03b7\n\nwhile for the second is\nx=\n\nx=\u2212\n\n\u2202h\n,\n\u2202\u03b7\n\ny=\n\n\u2202h u \u2202h\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u03b7 \u2202u\n\n(8)\n\n\u2202h\n\u2202u\n\n(9)\n\nwhere h is some solution of the Tricomi like equation\nhuu = \u03b7 3\u2212\u03b3 h\u03b7\u03b7 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe previous equation is nothing but the equation on the conservation law densities\nfor both systems. Formulas (8) and (9) realize the general or particular solution for\nboth systems if h is the general or particular solution of the equation (10) respectively.\nIn [3] and [4] two infinite serieses of quasi linear conservation laws were constructed for the polytropic gas and for the nonlinear elasticity equations respectively. Quasi linear means, that these conservation law densities are polynomials\nwith respect to u, \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u03b3 where \u03b3 is an arbitrary polytropic constant.\nHowever, as we see in the next section, these densities does not exhaust the set\nof all possible conserved densities.\n\n2\n\nSymmetry operator approach for \u03b3 6= 1.\n\nLet us first consider the more general form of the polytropic gas system\n\u03b7t = \u2202x (u\u03b7),\n\u03b7y = ux ,\n\nu2\nut = \u2202x [ + \u03b7f \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7) \u2212 f \u2032 (\u03b7)],\n2\nuy = \u2202x f \u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhere f is an arbitrary function. Our generalized system constitute Hamiltonian\nequations with the following local structure\n\u03b7t = \u2202x\n\n\u03b4H\n,\n\u03b4u\n\nut = \u2202x\n\n\u03b4H\n,\n\u03b4\u03b7\n\n\u03b7y = \u2202x\n\n\u03b4 H\u0303\n,\n\u03b4u\n\nuy = \u2202x\n\n\u03b4 H\u0303\n,\n\u03b4\u03b7\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\n1\n[ u2 \u03b7 + \u03b7f \u2032 (\u03b7) \u2212 2f (\u03b7)]dx,\n2\nZ\nu2\nH\u0303 =\n[ + f \u2032 (\u03b7)]dx.\n2\n\nH =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n(14)\n\n\fIn order to obtain the conserved densities we try to eliminate the differentials dq\nand dp from the corresponding conservation laws\n\u2202t h = \u2202x p,\n\n\u2202y h = \u2202x q\n\n(15)\n\nBy direct calculation we have\ndq = h\u03b7 du + f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)hu d\u03b7,\n\ndp = [uhu + \u03b7h\u03b7 ]du + [\u03b7f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)hu + uh\u03b7 ]d\u03b7\n\n(16)\n\nThe compatibility conditions ( (pu )\u03b7 = (p\u03b7 )u , (qu )\u03b7 = (q\u03b7 )u ) lead to the Tricomi like equation\nh\u03b7\u03b7 = f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)huu ,\n(17)\nSince, this equation is compatible with the shift symmetry operator (see [10])\n\u03b4 = \u2202/\u2202u,\n\n(18)\n\nhu = \u03bbh,\n\n(19)\n\none can search solutions in the form\n\nwhere \u03bb is an arbitrary parameter. This is the eigenvalue problem for the shift\nsymmetry operator. Then Tricomi-like equation is transformed to the linear ordinary\ndifferential equation\nh\u03b7\u03b7 = \u03bb2 f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)h.\n(20)\nHowever this equation cannot be solved explicitly for an arbitrary f .\nWe propose, from that reason, quite different approach. Let us observe that the\nshift symmetry operator transforms one solution of the Tricomi - like equation onto\nanother one\n\u2202u hn+1 = hn .\n(21)\nIt means that all conservation law densities hk and corresponding fluxes pk , qk can\nbe written down in the quadratures recursively\ndhk+1 = hk du + qk d\u03b7, dqk+1 = qk du + f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)hk d\u03b7,\ndpk+1 = [uhk + \u03b7qk ]du + [\u03b7f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7)hk + uqk ]d\u03b7.\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nInterestingly all known examples of the conserved densities could be obtained in this\nway.\nHowever we demonstrate different possibilities which give us new serieses of the\nconserved densities. Our main idea is based on the following observation.\nThe Tricomi like equation (10) is compatible with three local symmetry operators:\n1. Shift operator\n\u03b4=\n2.

Notice that the second formula in (28) is not in contradiction to\nprevious chain because formula (28) is valid for homogeneous conservation laws\nonly.\nNow let us consider the shallow water equation, e.g. the polytropic gas system\nwith \u03b3 = 2.

On the other side we can combine our\nmethod with this which generate quasi linear densities obtaining following diagram\n\n6\n\n\fh0k\n\nR\n\nh1k\n\nR\n\nh2k\n\n...\n\nR\n\nh1k +1\n\nR\n\nh2k +1\n\n...\n\nS\nh0k +1\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThis diagram obviously is closed. In order to see it let us start consideration from\n(n)\nsome hk .

We restrict, from that reason, to two cases where h1 = u and h2 = \u03b7.\nFor the first case we have c1 = 1. By direct verification one can check that\n(1)\n\nh1 = uh(\u03c4 ) + u ln u\nwhere \u03c4 =\n\nu2\n\u03b7\u03b3\u22121\n\n(44)\n\nsatisfy (43). The Tricomi like equation reduces in this case to\n\u0010\n\n\u03c4 2 4 \u2212 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)2\n\n\u0011 \u22022h\n\n\u22022\u03c4\nFor the second case we have c2 =\nverification, one can check that\n(1)\n\nh2\n\n\u0010\n\n+ 6 \u2212 \u03b3(\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c4\n\n\u0011 \u2202h\n\n+ 1 = 0.\n(45)\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\n. Similarly to the first case, by direct\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n= \u03b7h(\u03c4 ) + \u03b7 ln \u03b7\n(46)\n7\n\n\f(1)\n\nsatisfy (43). Substituting h2 to the Tricomi like equation (10) we obtain the following equation on the function h(\u03c4 )\n\u0010\n\n\u03c4 4 \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n\n\u0011 \u22022h\n\n\u22022\u03c4\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2212 2 \u2212 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)(\u03b3 \u2212 2)\u03c4\n\n\u0011 \u2202h\n\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n+1=0\n\n(47)\n\nIn both cases it is possible to obtain closed formulas for particular values of \u03b3\nparameter. However we can simplify our consideration using different coordinates.\nFor example choosing the coordinates r and p as [3]\n\u03b7 = rp,\n\nu=\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u03b3\u22121\nr\n+ p\u03b3\u22121 ,\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n(48)\n\nwe can rewrite the scaling symmetry operator and Tricomi like equation as\n1 \u0010 \u2202\n\u2202\u0011\nr +p\n\u03b3 \u2212 1 \u2202r\n\u2202p\n2\n2\n\u2202 h\n\u2202 h\n= r 3\u2212\u03b3 2\np3\u2212\u03b3 2\n\u2202 p\n\u2202 r\nR =\n\n(0)\n\nTaking into an account h1\ndensities\n(1)\n\n\u03b3 = 2,\n\nh1\n\n\u03b3 = 3,\n\u03b3 = 4,\n\n(1)\nh1\n(1)\nh1\n\n\u03b3 = 5,\n\nh1\n\n(1)\n\n(49)\n(1)\n\n= r we obtained the following solutions on the h1\n\n= \u2212(r \u2212 p) ln(r \u2212 p) + p ln(p)\n\n= (r + p) ln(r + p) \u2212 (r \u2212 p) ln(r \u2212 p)\n\n= \u2212(r \u2212 p) ln(r \u2212 p) + (r + 2p) ln(p2 + pr + r 2 )\n\u221a\np + 2r\n+ 3p arctan( \u221a )\n3p\n\n= (p + r) ln(p + r) + (r \u2212 p) ln(r \u2212 p) + r ln(p2 + r 2 )\nr\n+2p arctan( )\np\n\n(50)\n\nFinally let us present the solution for \u03b3 = 35 , 57 and \u03b3 = \u22121 which are interesting\nfrom the physical point because these describe dynamics of one-atomic gas and\ntwo-atomic gas [11] and two dimensional nonlinear Born-Infeld electrodynamics [12]\nrespectively.\n5\n\u03b3= ,\n3\n7\n\u03b3= ,\n5\n\n\u03b3 = \u22121,\n\n1\n2\n4\n3\nr\n(1)\nh1 = p arctanh\u03c4 3 + ln (3\u03c4 3 \u2212 3\u03c4 3 + \u03c4 2 \u2212 1)\n4\n2\n\u2212 32\n\u2212r ln \u03c4 \u2212 3r\u03c4\n1\n4\n8\n2\n6\n5\nr\n(1)\nh1 = p arctanh\u03c4 5 + ln ( \u2212 10\u03c4 5 \u2212 5\u03c4 5 + 5\u03c4 5 + \u03c4 5 + \u03c4 2 \u2212 1)\n4\n2\n4\n5 \u22122\n\u2212r ln \u03c4 \u2212 r\u03c4 5 \u2212 5r\u03c4 \u2212 5 + r ln r\n3\n2 2\n\u0010\npr\nr\u2212p \u0011\n1\n(1)\n)\n+\np\nln\n(\n)\n(51)\nh1 = r ln ( 2\n2\nr \u2212 p2\nr+p\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nSymmetry operator approach for \u03b3 = 1 and\ncorresponding non polynomial densities.\n\nFor this case the polytropic gas and the nonlinear elasticity systems are\n\u03b7t = \u2202x (u\u03b7),\n\nut = \u2202x\n\nh u2\n\n2\n\ni\n\n+ ln \u03b7 .\n\n1\nuy = \u2202x ( \u2212 ),\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b7y = ux ,\n\n(52)\n(53)\n\nrespectively. For this case the Euler - Darboux - Poisson equation (29) degenerates because \u03b5 \u2192 \u221e. Similarly the scaling operator R (see (25)) also becomes\ndegenerated.\nIn order to solve this problem we notice that the analogue of the symmetry\nalgebra (26) can be obtained considering the contraction with respect to \u03b3 = 1. If\nR and compute the limit when \u03b3 \u2192 1 we obtain\nwe rescale R \u2192 \u03b3\u22121\n2\n\u03b4 = \u2202u ,\n\nR = \u03b7\u2202\u03b7 ,\n\nS = ln \u03b7\u2202u + u\u03b7\u2202\u03b7 \u2212 u/2,\n\n(54)\n\nInterestingly now, in the contraction limit, the homogeneity properties (28) does\nnot hold. It means that the Tricomi-like equation\nhuu = \u03b7 2 h\u03b7\u03b7\n\n(55)\n\nhas no any homogeneous solutions.\nHowever the quasi-homogeneous solutions could be obtained ([9]). By quasihomogeneous we understand the homogeneous with respect to the one variable u or\nln \u03b7.\nFor our further applications we describe another possibility. We constructed\nthe generating function for the conserved densities. To end this we consider the\neigenvalue problem for each symmetry operator.\n1. For the scaling operator R (see (54)) the eigenvalue problem\nh\u03be = \u03bbh,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03be \u2261 \u03b7\u2202\u03b7 , reduces the Tricomi-like equation to the linear ordinary differential\nequation of the second order\nhuu = \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 1)h.\n(57)\nThese equations can be easily integrated and we obtained\nq\n\nh = exp[ \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 1)u + \u03bb\u03be].\n\n(58)\n\n2. For the shift operator \u03b4 (see (54)) the eigenvalue problem\nhu = \u03bb\u0303h\n\n(59)\n\nreduces the Tricomi-like equation to the linear ordinary differential equation of the\nsecond order\nh\u03be\u03be \u2212 h\u03be = \u03bb\u03032 h,\n(60)\n9\n\n\fThese equation are easily also to integrate and the solutions have the same form as\n(58) in which we should replace \u03bb2 \u2192 \u03bb\u0303(\u03bb\u0303 \u2212 1).\nIf one expands function h near \u03bb \u2192 0 or \u03bb \u2192 1, then one can obtain two\nwell-known infinite serieses of conservation law densities ([9]).\n3. Projective operator S (see (54)). If one substitutes\nh = q exp[\u03be/2],\n\nu = 2s cosh \u03b8,\n\n\u03be = 2s sinh \u03b8,\n\n(61)\n\nwhere s and \u03b8 are new functions, then the eigenvalue problem looks like\nq\u03b8 = \u03bbq\n\n(62)\n\nq = \u03c8(s) exp[\u03bb\u03b8],\n\n(63)\n\nNow the generating function is\n\nwhere the function \u03c8 satisfies the Bessel equation\n1\n\u03bb2\n\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 + \u03c8 \u2032 + [1 \u2212 2 ]\u03c8 = 0,\ns\ns\n\n(64)\n\nLet us present the most simplest example of the conserved densities obtained\nin this way, where it is possible to describe the Bessel function by the elementary\nfunctions for which \u03bb = 21\nh=\n\ns\n\nq\n\n\u0010 u2 \u2212 ln2 \u03b7 \u0011\n\u03b7\n.\ncos\nu \u2212 ln \u03b7\n2\n\n(65)\n\nUsing the recursion relations, known in the theory of Bessel functions, it is possible to\ngenerate infinite sets of conserved densities written in terms of elementary functions\nwithout any references to the recursion operator, which appear in the Hamiltonian\napproach to the polytropic gas systems. Finally we can use the shift or scaling\nsymmetry operators and generate some conserved densities as we did in the previous\nsections.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we constructed new extra series of conserved densities for the polytropic\ngas model and nonlinear elasticity equation avoiding using recursion operator or Lax\nformalism. Our Hamiltonians appeared as the non polynomial expressions which\ncontain logarithmic functions. If we continue our procedure to these logarithmic\ndensities in the next step we obtain expressions with the logarithmic function in\nan arbitrary power. We considered the singular case of the polytropic gas system\nalso, for which we found the non homogeneous solutions expressed in terms of Bessel\nfunctions. If we apply the point transformation to the symmetry operators then they\ncan change the role. It means that the scaling and shift operators are equivalent\nto each other, what it easy to see in the Riemann invariants (31) or (59,56). We\npresented this method for two hydrodynamical systems only, but this method can\nbe adopted to more complicated equations as well.\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nOne of the author (M.P.) thanks the Institute of Theoretical Physics University of\nWroclaw for their hospitality.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.Blaszak ,,Multi-Hamiltonian Theory of Dynamical Systems \" Springer -Verlag\n1998, P.Olver ,, Applications of Lie Group to Differential Equations \" , Springer\n- Verlag 1989.\n[2] M.
