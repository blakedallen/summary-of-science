Such a\nlongevity, along with the absence of any adjustable parameters, does not mean that this theory is absolutely\ncorrect, but it serves to motivate more accurate tests to\ndetermine the level of accuracy at which it is violated.\nEinstein's general theory of relativity (GR) began with\nits empirical success in 1915 by explaining the anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit, using no adjustable theoretical parameters. Shortly thereafter, Eddington's 1919 observations of star lines-of-sight during\na solar eclipse confirmed the doubling of the deflection\nangles predicted by GR as compared to Newtonian-like\nand Equivalence Principle arguments. This conformation\nmade the general theory of relativity an instant success.\nFrom these beginnings, the general theory of relativity has been verified at ever higher accuracy. Thus, microwave ranging to the Viking Lander on Mars yielded\naccuracy \u223c0.2% in the tests of GR [1, 2, 3]. Spacecraft\nand planetary radar observations reached an accuracy of\n\u223c0.15% [4]. The astrometric observations of quasars on\nthe solar background performed with Very-Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) improved the accuracy of the\ntests of gravity to \u223c0.045% [5, 6, 7]. Lunar laser rang-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: turyshev@jpl.nasa.gov\naddress: mshao@huey.jpl.nasa.gov\n\u2021 Electronic address: kennordtvedt@imt.net\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ning, a continuing legacy of the Apollo program, provided\n\u223c0.011% verification of GR via precision measurements\nof the lunar orbit [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Finally, the\nrecent experiments with the Cassini spacecraft improved\nthe accuracy of the tests to \u223c0.0023% [15]. As a result\ngeneral relativity became the standard theory of gravity when astrometry and spacecraft navigation are concerned.\nHowever, the tensor-scalar theories of gravity, where\nthe usual general relativity tensor field coexists with one\nor several long-range scalar fields, are believed to be the\nmost promising extension of the theoretical foundation\nof modern gravitational theory. The superstring, manydimensional Kaluza-Klein, and inflationary cosmology\ntheories have revived interest in the so-called 'dilaton\nfields', i.e. neutral scalar fields whose background values determine the strength of the coupling constants in\nthe effective four-dimensional theory. The importance of\nsuch theories is that they provide a possible route to the\nquantization of gravity and unification of physical law.\nRecent theoretical findings suggest that the present\nagreement between Einstein's theory and experiment\nmight be naturally compatible with the existence of a\nscalar contribution to gravity. In particular, Damour\nand Nordtvedt [16] (see also [17] for non-metric versions\nof this mechanism and [18] for the recent summary of a\ndilaton-runaway scenario) have found that a scalar-tensor\ntheory of gravity may contain a 'built-in' cosmological attractor mechanism towards GR. A possible scenario for\ncosmological evolution of the scalar field was given in\n[11, 16]. Their speculation assumes that the parameter\n1\n2 (1 \u2212 \u03b3) was of order of 1 in the early universe, at the\n\n\f2\ntime of inflation, and has evolved to be close to, but not\nexactly equal to, zero at the present time. In fact, the\nanalyzes discussed above not only motivate new searches\nfor very small deviations of relativistic gravity in the solar system, they also predict that such deviations are\ncurrently present in the range from 10\u22125 to \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22128\nof the post-Newtonian effects. This would require measurement of the effects of the next post-Newtonian order\n(\u221d G2 ) of light deflection resulting from gravity's intrinsic non-linearity. An ability to measure the first order\nlight deflection term at the accuracy comparable with\nthe effects of the second order is of the utmost importance for the gravitational theory and is the challenge\nfor the 21st century fundamental physics.\nThe Eddington parameter \u03b3, whose value in general\nrelativity is unity, is perhaps the most fundamental PPN\nparameter, in that (1 \u2212 \u03b3) is a measure, for example, of\nthe fractional strength of the scalar gravity interaction\nin scalar-tensor theories of gravity [19]. Within perturbation theory for such theories, all other PPN parameters to all relativistic orders collapse to their general\nrelativistic values in proportion to (1 \u2212 \u03b3). This is why\nmeasurement of the first order light deflection effect at\nthe level of accuracy comparable with the second-order\ncontribution would provide the crucial information separating alternative scalar-tensor theories of gravity from\nGR [20] and also to probe possible ways for gravity quantization and to test modern theories of cosmological evolution [16, 17, 18].\nThe LATOR mission is designed to directly address\nthe issue above with an unprecedented accuracy [21]. The\ntest will be performed in the solar gravity field using optical interferometry between two micro-spacecraft. Precise\nmeasurements of the angular position of the spacecraft\nwill be made using a fiber coupled multi-chanelled optical\ninterferometer on the ISS with a 100 m baseline. The primary objective of the LATOR mission will be to measure\nthe gravitational deflection of light by the solar gravity\nto accuracy of 0.1 picoradians (prad) (\u223c 0.02 \u03bcas), which\ncorresponds to \u223c10 picometers (pm) on a 100 m interferometric baseline.\nA combination of laser ranging among the spacecraft\nand direct interferometric measurements will allow LATOR to measure deflection of light in the solar gravity by\na factor of more than 3,000 better than had recently been\naccomplished with the Cassini spacecraft. In particular,\nthis mission will not only measure the key PPN parameter \u03b3 to unprecedented levels of accuracy of one part in\n108 . As a result, this experiment will measure values of\nother PPN parameters such as parameter \u03b4 to 1 part in\n103 and discussion thereafter), the solar quadrupole moment parameter J2 to 1 part in 20, and the frame dragging effects on light due to the solar angular momentum\nto precision of 1 parts in 102 .\nThe LATOR mission technologically is a very sound\nconcept; all technologies that are needed for its success\nhave been already demonstrated as a part of the JPL's\nSpace Interferometry Mission (SIM) development. Tech-\n\nnology that has become available in the last several years\nsuch as low cost microspacecraft, medium power highly\nefficient solid state and fiber lasers, and the development\nof long range interferometric techniques make possible an\nunprecedented factor of 3,000 improvement in this test of\ngeneral relativity possible. This mission is unique and is\nthe natural next step in solar system gravity experiments\nwhich fully exploits modern technologies.\nThis paper organized as follows: Section II provides\nthe overview for the LATOR experiment including the\npreliminary mission design. In Section III we discuss the\ncurrent design for the LATOR flight system. In Section\nIV we will discuss the expected performance for the LATOR instrument. Section V discusses the next steps that\nwill taken in the development of the LATOR mission.\n\nII.\n\nOVERVIEW OF LATOR\n\nThe LATOR experiment uses laser interferometry between two micro-spacecraft whose lines of sight pass close\nby the Sun to accurately measure deflection of light in the\nsolar gravity [21]. Another component of the experimental design is a long-baseline stellar optical interferometer\nplaced on the ISS. Figure 1 shows the general concept\nfor the LATOR missions including the mission-related\ngeometry, experiment details and required accuracies.\nWe shall now discuss the LATOR mission in detail.\n\nA.\n\nMission Design\n\nAs evident from Figure 1, the key element of the LATOR experiment is a redundant geometry optical truss to\nmeasure the departure from Euclidean geometry caused\nby gravity. Two spacecraft are injected into a heliocentric\nsolar orbit on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth.\nThe triangle in figure has three independent quantities\nbut three arms are monitored with laser metrology. In\nparticular, each spacecraft equipped with a laser ranging\nsystem that enable a measurement of the arms of the triangle formed by the two spacecraft and the ISS. According to Euclidean rules this determines a specific angle at\nthe interferometer; LATOR can directly measure this angle directly. In particular, the laser beams transmitted by\neach spacecraft are detected by a long baseline (\u223c 100 m)\noptical interferometer on the ISS. The actual angle measured at interferometer is compared to angle calculated\nusing Euclidean rules and three side measurements; the\ndifference is the non-Euclidean deflection signal [which\nvaries in time during spacecraft passages] which contains\nthe scientific information. Therefore, the uniqueness of\nthis mission comes with its built-in geometrically redundant architecture that enables LATOR to measure the\ndeparture from Euclidean geometry caused by the solar gravity field to a very high accuracy. The accurate\nmeasurement of this departure constitutes the primary\nmission objective.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: The overall geometry of the LATOR experiment.\n\nTo enable the primary objective, LATOR will place\ntwo spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit so that observations may be made when the spacecraft are behind the\nSun as viewed from the ISS. The two spacecraft are to be\nseparated by about 1\u25e6 , as viewed from the ISS [22, 23].\nWith the help of the JPL Advanced Project Design Team\n(Team X), we recently conducted a detailed mission design studies [24]. In particular, we analyzed various trajectory options for the deep-space flight segment of LATOR, using both Orbit Determination Program (ODP)\nand Satellite Orbit Analysis Program (SOAP) \u2013 the two\nstandard JPL navigation software packages.\nAn orbit with a 3:2 resonance with the Earth was found\nto uniquely satisfy the LATOR orbital requirements [24].\n(The 3:2 resonance occurs when the Earth does 3 revolutions around the Sun while the spacecraft does exactly\n2 revolutions of a 1.5 year orbit. The exact period of\nthe orbit may vary slightly (<1%) from a 3:2 resonance\ndepending on the time of launch.) For this orbit, in 13\nmonths after the launch, the spacecraft are within \u223c 10\u25e6\nof the Sun with first occultation occuring in 15 months\nafter launch [21]. At this point, LATOR is orbiting at a\nslower speed than the Earth, but as LATOR approaches\nits perihelion, its motion in the sky begins to reverse and\nthe spacecraft is again occulted by the Sun 18 months\nafter launch. As the spacecraft slows down and moves\n\nout toward aphelion, its motion in the sky reverses again\nand it is occulted by the Sun for the third and final time\n21 months after launch.\nThe 3:2 Earth resonant orbit provides an almost ideal\ntrajectory for the LATOR mission, specifically i) it imposes no restrictions on the time of launch; ii) with a\nsmall propulsion maneuver after launch, it places the\ntwo LATOR spacecraft at the distance of less then 3.5\u25e6\n(or \u223c 14 R\u2299) for the entire duration of the experiment\n(or \u223c8 months); iii) it provides three solar conjunctions\neven during the nominal mission lifetime of 22 months,\nall within 7 month period; iv) at a cost of an extra maneuver, it offers a possibility of achieving small orbital\ninclinations (to enable measurements at different solar\nlatitudes), and, finally, v) it offers a very slow change\nin the Sun-Earth-Probe (SEP) angle of about \u223c R\u2299 in\n4 days. As such, this orbit represents a very attractive\nchoice for LATOR.\nWe intend to further study this 3:2 Earth resonant trajectory as the baseline option for the mission. In particular, there is an option to have the two spacecraft move in\nopposite directions during the solar conjunctions. This\noption will increase the amount of \u2206v LATOR should\ncarry on-board, but it significantly reduces the experiment's dependence on the accuracy of determination of\nthe solar impact parameter. This particular option is\n\n\f4\ncurrently being investigated and results will be reported\nelsewhere.\nWe shall now consider the basic elements of the LATOR optical design.\n\nB.\n\nOptical Design\n\nA single aperture of the interferometer on the ISS consists of three 20 cm diameter telescopes (see Figure 2 for\na conceptual design). One of the telescopes with a very\nnarrow bandwidth laser line filter in front and with an\nInGAs camera at its focal plane, sensitive to the 1.3 \u03bcm\nlaser light, serves as the acquisition telescope to locate\nthe spacecraft near the Sun.\nThe second telescope emits the directing beacon to the\nspacecraft. Both spacecraft are served out of one telescope by a pair of piezo controlled mirrors placed on the\nfocal plane. The properly collimated laser light (\u223c10W)\nis injected into the telescope focal plane and deflected in\nthe right direction by the piezo-actuated mirrors.\nThe third telescope is the laser light tracking interferometer input aperture which can track both spacecraft at\nthe same time. To eliminate beam walk on the critical elements of this telescope, two piezo-electric X-Y-Z stages\nare used to move two single-mode fiber tips on a spherical surface while maintaining focus and beam position on\nthe fibers and other optics. Dithering at a few Hz is used\nto make the alignment to the fibers and the subsequent\ntracking of the two spacecraft completely automatic. The\ninterferometric tracking telescopes are coupled together\nby a network of single-mode fibers whose relative length\nchanges are measured internally by a heterodyne metrology system to an accuracy of less than 10 pm.\nThe spacecraft are identical in construction and contain a relatively high powered (1 W), stable (2 MHz per\nhour \u223c 500 Hz per second), small cavity fiber-amplified\nlaser at 1.3 \u03bcm. Three quarters of the power of this\nlaser is pointed to the Earth through a 20 cm aperture\ntelescope and its phase is tracked by the interferometer.\nWith the available power and the beam divergence, there\nare enough photons to track the slowly drifting phase of\nthe laser light. The remaining part of the laser power\nis diverted to another telescope, which points towards\nthe other spacecraft. In addition to the two transmitting\ntelescopes, each spacecraft has two receiving telescopes.\nThe receiving telescope on the ISS, which points towards\nthe area near the Sun, has laser line filters and a simple knife-edge coronagraph to suppress the Sun light to\n1 part in 104 of the light level of the light received from\nthe space station. The receiving telescope that points to\nthe other spacecraft is free of the Sun light filter and the\ncoronagraph.\nIn addition to the four telescopes they carry, the spacecraft also carry a tiny (2.5 cm) telescope with a CCD\ncamera. This telescope is used to initially point the\nspacecraft directly towards the Sun so that their signal\nmay be seen at the space station. One more of these\n\nsmall telescopes may also be installed at right angles to\nthe first one to determine the spacecraft attitude using\nknown, bright stars. The receiving telescope looking towards the other spacecraft may be used for this purpose\npart of the time, reducing hardware complexity. Star\ntrackers with this construction have been demonstrated\nmany years ago and they are readily available. A small\nRF transponder with an omni-directional antenna is also\nincluded in the instrument package to track the spacecraft while they are on their way to assume the orbital\nposition needed for the experiment.\nThe LATOR experiment has a number of advantages\nover techniques which use radio waves to measure gravitational light deflection. Advances in optical communications technology, allow low bandwidth telecommunications with the LATOR spacecraft without having to\ndeploy high gain radio antennae needed to communicate\nthrough the solar corona. The use of the monochromatic\nlight enables the observation of the spacecraft almost at\nthe limb of the Sun, as seen from the ISS. The use of narrowband filters, coronagraph optics and heterodyne detection will suppress background light to a level where the\nsolar background is no longer the dominant noise source.\nIn addition, the short wavelength allows much more efficient links with smaller apertures, thereby eliminating\nthe need for a deployable antenna. Finally, the use of the\nISS will allow conducting the test above the Earth's atmosphere \u2013 the major source of astrometric noise for any\nground based interferometer. This fact justifies LATOR\nas a space mission.\nC.\n\nLATOR Interferometry\n\nIn this section, we describe how angle measurements\nare made using the LATOR ground based interferometer. Since the spacecraft are monochromatic sources, the\ninterferometer can efficiently use heterodyne detection to\nmeasure the phase of the incoming signal. The next\nsection provides a simplified explanation of heterodyne\ninterferometry for LATOR interferometer. This section\nalso describes the use of ISS's orbit to resolve the fringe\nambiguity that arises from using monochromatic signals.\n1.\n\nHeterodyne Interferometry\n\nFigures 3-5 show a simplified schematic of now angles\nare measured using a heterodyne interferometer. In Fig.\n3, two siderostats are pointed at a target Two fiducials,\nshown as corner cubes, define the end points of the interferometer baseline . The light from each of the two arms\nis interfered with stable local oscillators (LOs) and the\nphase difference recorded. If the LOs in each arm were\nphase locked, the angles of the target with respect to the\nbaseline normal is\n\u03b8 = arcsin[\n\n(2\u03c0n + \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )\u03bb\n]\n2\u03c0b\n\n(1)\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 2: Basic elements of the LATOR optical design. The laser light (together with the solar background) is going through\na full aperture (\u223c 20cm) narrow band-pass filter with \u223c 10\u22124 suppression properties. The remaining light illuminates the\nbaseline metrology corner cube and falls onto a steering flat mirror where it is reflected to an off-axis telescope with no central\nobscuration (needed for metrology). It is then enters the solar coronograph compressor by first going through a 1/2 plane focal\nplane occulter and then coming to a Lyot stop. At the Lyot stop, the background solar light is reduced by a factor of 106 . The\ncombination of a narrow band-pass filter and coronograph enables the solar luminosity reduction from V = \u221226 to V = 4 (as\nmeasured at the ISS), thus, enabling the LATOR precision observations.\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the downlink laser, n is\nan unknown integer arising from the fringe ambiguity\nand b is the baseline length. In order to resolve this\nambiguity multiple baselines were used in the previous\nmission design. This is discussed in greater detail in [23].\nIn reality, it is difficult to phase lock the two LOs over the\nlong baseline lengths. Figure 4 shows how a single LO\ncan be used and transmitted to both siderostats using\na single mode fiber. In this configuration, a metrology\nsystem is used to monitor changes in the path length as\nseen by the LO as it propagates through the fiber. The\nmetrology system measures the distance from one beam\nsputter to the other. In this case, the angle is given by\n\n\u03b8 = arcsin[\n\n(2\u03c0n + \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 + m1 )\u03bb\n]\n2\u03c0b\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ml is the phase variations introduced by changes in\nthe optical path of the fiber as measured by the metrology\nsystem.\nNow consider the angle measurement between two\nspacecraft (Fig. 5). In this case the phase variations due\nto changes in the path through the fiber are common to\n\nboth spacecraft. The differential angle is\n\n\u0002 (2\u03c0(n1 \u2212 n2 ) + (m1 \u2212 m2 ))\u03bb\n+\n2\u03c0b\n((\u03c611 \u2212 \u03c612 ) \u2212 (\u03c621 \u2212 \u03c622 ))\u03bb \u0003\n+\n2\u03c0b\n\n\u03b8 = arcsin\n\n(3)\n\nSince the spacecraft are monochromatic sources, the interferometer can efficiently use heterodyne detection to\nmeasure the phase of the incoming signal. Note that\nbecause this is a differential measurement, it is independent of the any changes in the fiber length. In reality,\nthe interferometer will have optical paths that are different between the two spacecraft signal paths. These\npaths that must be monitored accurately with a metrology system to correct for phase changes in the optical\nsystem due to thermal variations. However, this metrology must only measure path lengths in each ground station and not along the entire length of the fiber. A more\ndetailed design for the LATOR interferometer is given in\nSec. III B.\n\n\f6\nsolve the baseline orientation for each ISS orbit, making\nthe fringe ambiguity not a problem for LATOR.\nIII.\n\nFIG. 3: Heterodyne interferometry on 1 spacecraft with phase\nlocked local oscillator.\n\nLATOR FLIGHT SYSTEM\n\nThe LATOR flight system consists of two major components \u2013 the deep-space component that will be used to\ntransmit and receive the laser signals needed to make the\nscience measurements and the interferometer on the ISS\nthat will be used to interferometrically measure the angle\nbetween the two spacecraft and to transmit and receive\nthe laser ranging signal to each of the spacecraft.\nIn this Section we will discuss the design of these components in more details.\nA.\n\nFIG. 4: Fiber-linked heterodyne interferometry and fiber\nmetrology system.\n\nFIG. 5: Heterodyne interferometry on 2 spacecraft.\n\n2.\n\nResolving the Fringe Ambiguity\n\nThe use of multiple interferometers is a standard solution to resolve the fringe ambiguity resulting from the\ninterferometric detection of monochromatic light [21].\nThe current LATOR mission proposal is immune for the\nfringe ambiguity problem as the orbit of the ISS provides enough variability (at least \u223c 30%) in the baseline\nprojection. This variablity enables one to take multiple\nmeasurements during one orbit, in order to uniquely re-\n\nLATOR Spacecraft\n\nThere are two LATOR spacecraft in the deep-space\ncomponent of the mission which will be used to transmit\nand receive the laser signals needed to make the science\nmeasurements. Figure 6 shows a schematic of the flight\nsystem without the solar cell array. The flight system is\nsubdivided into the instrument payload and the spacecraft bus. The instrument includes the laser ranging and\ncommunications hardware and is described in more detail\nin the following section. The spacecraft contains the remainder of the flight hardware which includes solar cells,\nattitude control, and the spacecraft structure.\n\nFIG. 6: LATOR spacecraft concept.\n\nThe LATOR spacecraft, like most spacecraft, will be\ncomposed of the following subsystems: thermal, structural, attitude control (ACS), power, command and data\nhandling, telecommunications, and propulsion, in particular:\n\u2022 Thermal: The basic thermal design will similar to\nthat of the SA-200B, with modifications to account\nfor the variation in range. This design uses basically passive thermal control elements with electric\nheaters/thermostats. The thermal control flight\nelements are multilayer insulation (MLI), thermal\n\n\f7\n\u2022 Attitude Control: An attitude control system\nmay be required to have pointing accuracy of 6\n\u03bcrad and a pointing knowledge of 3 \u03bcrad. This\nmay be achieved using a star tracker and sun sensor\ncombination to determine attitude together with\nreaction wheels (RW) to control attitude. Cold-gas\njets may be used to desaturate RWs. A Spectrum\nAstro SA-200B 3-axis stabilized bus with RWs for\nfine pointing and thrusters for RW desaturation is\na good platform [24]. For the current experiment\ndesign it is sufficient to utilize a pointing architecture with the following performance (3 sigma, per\naxis): control 6 \u03bcrad; knowledge 3 \u03bcrad; stability\n0.1 \u03bcrad/sec. The SA-200B readily accommodates\nthese requirements.\n\u2022 Power Subsystem: The flight system will require\n\u223c50 W of power. This may be supplied by a 1\nsquare meter GaAs solar cell array. To maintain a\nconstant attitude with respect to the Sun, the solar\ncells must be deployed away from the body of the\nspacecraft. This will allow the cells to radiate away\nits heat to maintain the cells within their operating\ntemperature range.\n\nFIG. 7: A typical Spectrum Astro SA-200S/B bus. With\nminor modifications this configuration may be adopted for\nthe deep-space component of the LATOR mission.\n\nsurfaces, thermal conduction control, and sensors.\nThe active elements are minimized and will be only\nelectric heaters/thermostats. To minimize heater\npower thermal louvers may be used. The current\ndesign assumes that spacecraft uses passive thermal control with heaters/thermostats because it is\nbasically designed for Earth orbit.\n\u2022 Structural: The current best estimate (CBE) for\nthe total dry mass is 115kg including a set of required modifications to the standard SA-200B bus\n(i.e. a small propulsion system, a 0.5m HGA for\ndeep-space telecom, etc.) The design calls for\nlaunching the two spacecraft side-by-side on a custom carrier structure as they should easily fit into\nthe fairing (for instance, Delta II 2425-9.5). The total launch mass for the two spacecraft will be 552\nkg. This estimate may be further reduced, given\nmore time to develop a point design.\n\n\u2022 Telecommunications: The telecommunications\nsubsystem will be a hybrid which will utilize the optical communications capability of the instrument\nas the primary means of transmitting and receiving commands and data. In addition, a small low\ngain antenna for low data rate radio communications will be used for emergency purposes. This\nsystem will use a 15 W transmitter and 10 dB gain\nantenna. Using X band this system can operate\nwith a 5 bit per second (bps) data rate. The design\ncalls for an SDST X-Band transponder, operating\nat 15 W X-Band SSPA, a 0.5m HGA, two X-Band\nLGAs pointed opposite each other, a duplexer, two\nswitches and coax cabling.\n\u2022 Propulsion: The propulsion subsystem for SA200S bus will be used as is. This will ensure a\nminimal amount of engineering required. System is\na blowdown monopropellant system with eight 5N\nthrusters, two 32 cm tanks all with 22kg propellant\ncapacity. The system exists and was tested in may\napplications.\n\nB.\n\nInterferometer on the ISS\n\nThe LATOR ground station is used to interferometrically measure the angle between the two spacecraft and\nto transmit and receive the laser ranging signal to each\nof the spacecraft. A block diagram of the laser ground\nstation is shown in Fig. 8 and is described in more detail below. The station on the ISS is composed of a two\nlaser beacon stations which perform communications and\nlaser ranging to the spacecraft and two interferometer\n\n\f8\nstations which collect the downlink signal for the astrometric measurement. In addition the station uses a fiber\noptic link to transmit the common local oscillator to the\ninterferometer stations.\n\nInterferometer Stations\n\nThe interferometer stations collect the laser signal from\nboth spacecraft to perform the heterodyne measurements\nneeded for the interferometric angle measurement. There\nare a total of five receivers to make the four angular measurements needed to resolve fringe ambiguity.\nThe detection and tracking system is basically similar\nto the receiver arm of the laser beacon described in the\nprevious section. Light is collected by a 0.2 meter siderostat mirror and compressed with a telescope to a manageable beam size. The light from each of the spacecraft\nis separated using a dual feed optical system as shown in\nFig. 10. A fast steering mirror is used for high bandwidth\npointing of the receiver. Each spacecraft signal is interfered with a local oscillator and the phase measurement\ntime tagged and recorded. A 6 \u00d7 6 Ge array (5 \u00d7 5 arcsec FOV) is used to provide heterodyne acquisition and\ntracking of the LATOR spacecraft.\n\nFIG. 8: LATOR station block diagram.\n\nLaser Beacon Station\n\nThe laser beacon stations provide the uplink signals\nto the LATOR spacecraft and detect their downlink signals. The transmitter laser signal is modulated for laser\nranging and to provide optical communications. Separate transmitters are used for each spacecraft each using\na 1 W laser frequency doubled Nd:Yad laser at 532 nm as\nthe source for each laser beacon. The laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 0.2 meter and is directed toward\nthe spacecraft using a siderostat mirror. Fine pointing\nis accomplished with a fast steering mirror in the optical\ntrain.\nDuring initial acquisition, the optical system of the\nlaser beacon is modified to produce a team with a 30\narcsec divergence. This angular spread is necessary to\nguarantee a link with the spacecraft, albeit a weak one,\nin the presence of pointing uncertainties. After the acquisition sequence is complete, the beam is narrowed to\na diffraction limited beam, thereby increasing the signal\nstrength.\nThe downlink laser signal at 1.3 \u03bcm, is detected using\na 12 \u00d7 12 (10 \u00d7 10 arcsec) array of Germanium detectors.\nIn order to suppress the solar background, the signal is\nheterodyned with a local oscillator and detected within a\nnarrow 5 kHz bandwidth. In the initial acquisition mode,\nthe detection system searches over a 300 MHz bandwidth\nand uses a spiral search over a 30 arcsec angular field to\nfind the downlink signal. Upon acquisition, the search\nbandwidth is decreased to 5 kHz and a quad-cell subarray\nis used to point the siderostat and fast steering mirrors\nof the beacon.\n\nFIG. 9: Receiver on the ISS.\n\nFIG. 10: Dual feed optical system.\n\n\f9\nISS-Based Interferometer\n\nFigure 11 shows a schematic of the ISS-based fiber interferometer used to perform the angular measurement\nbetween the spacecraft. A detailed description of how\nthis interferometer makes its measurement is presented\nin Section II C. The interferometer includes tie heterodyne detection of the downlink signals which have been\ndescribed in the previous section. The local oscillator\n(LO) is generated in one of the ground station receivers\nand is frequency locked to the laser signal from one of\nthe spacecraft. The LO is then broadcast to the other\nstation on the ISS through a 100 m single mode polarization preserving fiber. The heterodyne signals from all\nthe stations (2 stations, 2 signals each) are recorded and\ntime tagged.\nFigure 11 also shows two metrology systems used in\nthe interferometer. The first metrology system measures\nthe difference in optical path between the two laser signal\npaths and is essential to proper processing of the heterodyne data. The second metrology system measures the\nchanges in the optical path through the fiber. This measurement monitors the length of the fiber and is used in\nthe post processing of the interferometer data. The internal path metrology system, shown in the figure, measures the paths from corner cube on the siderostat mirror\n(shown as two, really only one) to the metrology beam\nsputter. It is essential that the laser metrology system\nbe boresighted to the laser signal path so the correct distance is measured. A Michelson interferometer with a\nfrequency shift in one arm measure changes in the length\nof each signal path. Both spacecraft signal paths are measured simultaneously. This is accomplished by using an\nelectro-optic cell and modulating each beam at a different\nfrequency. A He-Ne laser is used as the light source for\nthis metrology system. Filters at the output of the detector are then used to separate the signals corresponding\nto each metrology beam.\nThe fiber metrology system measures changes in the\noptical path through the fiber. This system uses local\noscillator signal in a Michelson configuration. Figure 12\nshows the correspondence between a standard Michelson\ninterferometer and the fiber metrology system. The two\nX couplers serve as the beam splitters. Reflectors at the\nends of the fiber couplers serve as the reference and signal\nmirrors. One of these reflectors is dithered to frequency\nshift the output signal. The phase measurement at the\ndetector measures changes in the path length between\npoints X1 and X2, if Ml-X1 and M2-X2 are held constant. This is accomplished by placing the X couplers\nand mirrors at each end of the fiber on a single thermally\nstable optical breadboard.\nThe interferometer will be formed by the two optical transponder assemblies with dimensions of approximately 0.6 m \u00d7 0.6 m \u00d7 0.6 m for each assembly (Fig. 13).\nThe mass of each telescope assembly will be about 120\nkg. The location of these packages on the ISS and their\nintegration with the ISS's power, communication and at-\n\ntitude control system are given below:\n\u2022 Two LATOR transponders will be physically located and integrated with the ISS infrastructure.\nThe location will enable the straight-line separation between the two transponders of \u223c100 m and\nwill provide a clear line-of-site (LOS) path between\nthe two transponders during the observation periods. Both transponder packages will have clear\nLOS to their corresponding heliocentric spacecraft\nduring pre-defined measurement periods.\n\u2022 The transponders will be physically located on the\nISS structure to maximize the inherent ISS suntracking capability. The transponders will need to\npoint towards the Sun during each observing period. By locating these payloads on the ISS outboard truss segments (P6 and S6 outwards), a limited degree of automatic sun-tracking capability is\nafforded by the alpha-gimbals on the ISS.\n\u2022 The minimum unobstructed LOS time duration\nbetween each transponder on the ISS and the\ntransponders and their respective spacecraft will be\n58 minutes per the 92 min orbit of the ISS.\n\u2022 The pointing error of each transponder to its corresponding spacecraft will be no greater than 1 \u03bcrad\nfor control, 1 \u03bcrad for knowledge, with a stability of 0.1 \u03bcrad/sec, provided by combination of the\nstandard GPS link available on the ISS and \u03bc-g\naccelerometers.\nC.\n\nLATOR Instrument\n\nThe LATOR instrument is used to perform laser ranging between the two spacecraft; it is also used (the second set) for laser ranging and optical communications\nbetween the spacecraft and the ISS. Figure 14 shows a\nblock diagram of the instrument subsystems which are\ndescribe in more detail below.\n\u2022 ISS-SC Receiver/Transmitter: The ISS/SC receiver performs the acquisition, tracking, and detection of the signals from the ISS (Figure 15). This\nuplinked signal will be sent at 1064 nm and will\ncontain modulation to perform both laser ranging\nand to send control signals to the spacecraft. The\nsignals from the ISS are detected by a telescope\nwith a collecting aperture of 20 cm. A coronograph\nwill by used to suppress stray light from the Sun.\nIn addition a combination of a wideband interference filter and a narrow band Faraday Anomalous\nDispersion Optical Filter (FADOF) will used to reject light outside a 0.005 nm band around the laser\nline. The incoming signal is subdivided with one\nportion going to a high bandwidth detector and\nthe other to an acquisition and tracking CCD array. Using a 64 \u00d7 64 CCD array with pixels sized\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 11: ISS-based interferometer.\n\nand communication information. In particular, the\ntransmitted signal will include the inter-spacecraft\nranging measurements. The transmitter uses a 2 W\nfrequency stabilized Nd:YAG laser at 1.3 \u03bcm. A\n5 kHz line width is required to simplify heterodyne\ndetection at the ground station. A 0.15 meter telescope is used to transmit the laser beam and a\nsteering mirror is used for pointing. The mirror\nuses information from the attitude control system\n(ACS), the quad-cell detector in the receiver, and\nthe point ahead information from the instrument\ncontroller to determine the transmit direction. A\nfast steering mirror is used to maintain high bandwidth pointing control for both the transmitter and\nreceiver.\nFIG. 12: Fiber metrology system.\n\nto a diffraction limited spot, this array will have\na 5 arcmin field of view which is greater than the\npointing knowledge of the attitude control system\nand the point ahead angle (40 arcsec). After acquisition of the ISS beacon, a 2 \u00d7 2 element subarray\nof the CCD will be used as a quad cell to control\nthe ISS-SC two axis steering mirror. This pointing\nmirror is common to both the receiver and transmitter channel to minimize misalignments between\nthe two optical systems due to thermal variations.\nThe pointing mirror will have 10 arcminute throw\nand a pointing accuracy of 0.5 arcsec which will\nenable placement of the uplink signal on the high\nbandwidth detector.\nThe ISS-SC transmitter sends a laser signal to both\nthe interferometer collectors and the beacon receivers. The signal will be encoded for both ranging\n\nWe have also considering the possibility of using\na common optical system for both the transmitter and receiver. Figure 16 shows a schematic of\nsuch a transmitter/receiver system. Because of the\ndifference in the receive and transmit wavelengths,\ndichroic beam splitters and filters are used to minimize losses from the optics and leakage into the\ndetectors. In this scheme a point ahead mirror is\nused maintain a constant angular offset between\nthe received and transmitted beams. Because of\nthe common optical elements, this system is more\ntolerant to misalignments than the previous configuration.\n\u2022 Inter-S/C Receiver/Transmitter: The interS/C receiver/transmitter uses two separate optical systems. The receiver detects the laser ranging signal from the other spacecraft. The receiver\nis similar in design to the ISS-S/C receiver subsystem. Since there is no solar background contribution, the coronograph and FADOF filter have been\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 13: Location of the LATOR interferometer on the ISS.

Detection of the signal is accomplished\nusing a CCD for acquisition and a quad cell subarray for tracking. The tracking signal is also used\nto control the pointing of the transmitter minor.\nA separate high bandwidth detector is used for detecting the laser ranging signal.\nThe inter-S/C transmitter sends the laser ranging\nsignal to the other spacecraft. The transmitter uses\na 780 nm laser with an output power of 10 mW.\nThe transmitter and receiver telescopes have an\naperture of 0.1 m diameter. Because of the close\n\nproximity of the LATOR spacecraft, thermal drifts\nwhich cause misalignments between the transmitter\nand receiver optical systems can be sensed and corrected rapidly. In addition, the LATOR geometry\nrequires minimal point ahead since the transverse\nvelocity between spacecraft is nearly zero.\n\u2022 Instrument Controller: The instrument controller subsystem contains the remainder of the instrument hardware. This includes the electronics\nneeded for the laser ranging and optical communications as well as the computer used to control the\ninstrument. The instrument computer will take in-\n\n\f12\nlight is first frequency stabilized to better than 1\npart in 1010 , in order to make the measurements.\nThe laser light is then frequency modulated in order to produce the heterodyne signal and distinguish between incoming and outgoing beams. Finally light is then collimated and injected into the\nbeam launcher optics. The incoming metrology signal is received by the beam launcher optics and is\ninterfered with the local laser. A cat's eye retroreflector serves as the spacecraft fiducial and is common to all three beam launchers.\n\nFIG. 16: ISS-S/C Link with common optics: spiral scanning spatial acquisition; open loop point ahead control with\npiezo actuators; fiber-coupled, frequency stabilized transmitter; pupil planes at the steering mirror and mixing apertures.\n\nFIG. 17: ISS-S/C Link with common optics: spiral scanning spatial acquisition; open loop point ahead control with\npiezo actuators; fiber-coupled, frequency stabilized transmitter; pupil planes at the steering mirror and mixing apertures.\n\nformation from the attitude control system and receiver subsystems in order to control the pointing\nof the transmit subsystems and the modulation of\ntheir laser signals.\nThe LATOR instrument in each of the two spacecraft consist of three laser metrology transmitters and\nreceivers which can be gimbaled to point at the other\nspacecraft, and a camera system to acquire the incoming\nlaser signals and to control the pointing of the outgoing beams. In addition, the instrument contains a laser\nranging transponder in order to determine the spacecraft\nposition from the ground.\n\u2022 Laser Metrology Transceiver Subsystem The\nmetrology transceiver consists of the laser, modulators, optics, and frequency stabilizer. The laser\n\n\u2022 Beam Launcher/Receiver Optics: In the current instrument design, the modulated laser beam\nis injected using a polarization preserving single\nmode fiber and expanded to a 0.5 cm beam. A cat's\neye retroreflector is one of several devices that can\nbe used as the metrology fiducial and is common to\nthe three metrology beams. The cat's eye uses two\noptically contacted concentric hemispheres with radius of \u223c 10 cm and \u223c 20 cm. The cat's eye is sized\nmany times larger than the beam in order to minimize the effect of spherical aberration. The beam\nis then expanded to a 5 cm beam using a refractive\ntelescope. A refractive design was chosen because\nchanges in the optical path are relatively insensitive to changes in the position and orientation of\nthe optical elements.\n\u2022 Acquisition Camera (AC) Subsystem: AC\nthat will be used as the sensor for pointing the\nmetrology beam. In the previous study the 512 \u00d7\n512 camera was used to detect the position of the\nincoming laser beam to 0.5 arcsec over a 1 degree\nfield by interpolating the centroid of the spot to\n0.1 pixel. Three cameras were used to track each\nof the incoming metrology beams. The outgoing\nlaser beam was retroreflected from the alignment\ncorner cube to produce a spot on the acquisition\ncamera on which to servo the pointing gimbal.\n\u2022 Pointing Subsystem: In the current instrument\ndesign the entire beam launcher optical assembly is\ngimbaled to point the metrology beam to the target spacecraft. The 2-axis gimbal has a center of\nrotation at the center of the cat's eye retro reflector.\nThis optical arrangement measures the distance between the optical fiducials and is not sensitive to\nslight misalignments to first order. The gimbal will\nhave a range of 1 degree and a pointing resolution\nof 0.5 arcsec.\n\nD.\n\nLATOR Operations\n\nThis section describes the sequence of events that lead\nto the signal acquisition and that occurs during each observation period. This sequence will be initiated at the\nbeginning of the experiment period, after ISS emergence\n\n\f13\nfrom the Earth's shadow. It assumed that boresighting\nof the spacecraft attitude with the spacecraft transmitters and receivers have already been accomplished. This\nsequence of operations is focused on establishing the ISS\nto spacecraft link. The interspacecraft link is assumed\nto be continuously established after final-deployment (at\n\u223c 15\u25e6 off the Sun), since the spacecraft never lose line of\nsight with one another.\nThe laser beacon transmitter at the ISS is expanded\nto have a beam divergence of 30 arcsec in order to guarantee illumination of the LATOR spacecraft. After reemerging from the Earth's shadow this beam is transmitted to the craft and reaches them in about 18 minutes. At this point, the LATOR spacecraft acquire the\nexpanded laser beacon signal. In this mode, a signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of 4 can be achieved with 30 seconds\nof integration. With an attitude knowledge of 10 arcsec\nand an array field of view of 30 arcsec no spiral search is\nnecessary. Upon acquisition, the receiver mirror on the\nspacecraft will center the signal and use only the center\nquad array for pointing control. Transition from acquisition to tracking should take about 1 minute. Due to the\nweak uplink intensity, at this point, tracking of the ISS\nstation is done at a very low bandwidth. The pointing\ninformation is fed-forward to the spacecraft transmitter\npointing system and the transmitter is turned on. The\nsignal is then re-transmitted down to the ISS with a lighttravel time of 18 minutes.\nEach interferometer station and laser beacon station\nsearches for the spacecraft laser signal. The return is heterodyned with using an expanded bandwidth of 300 MHz.\nIn this case, the solar background is the dominant source\nof noise, and an SNR ratio of 5 is achieved with 1 second integration. Because of the small field of view of the\narray, a spiral search will take 30 seconds to cover a 30\narcsec field. Upon acquisition, the signal will be centered\non the quad cell portion of the array and the local oscillator frequency locked to the spacecraft signal. The\nfrequency band will then be narrowed to 5 kHz. In this\nregime, the solar background is no longer the dominant\nnoise source and an SNR of 17.6 can be achieved in only\n10 msec of integration. This will allow one to have a\nclosed loop pointing bandwidth of greater than 100 Hz\nand be able to compensate for the tilt errors introduced\nby the atmosphere. The laser beacon transmitter will\nthen narrow its beam to be diffraction limited (\u223c1 arcsec) aid point toward the LATOR spacecraft. This completes the signal acquisition phase, the entire architecture\nis in-lock and transmits scientific signal. This procedure\nis re-established during each 92-minute orbit of the ISS.\nIn the next section we will consider the LATOR preliminary astrometric error budget.\n\nIV.\n\nASTROMETRIC PERFORMANCE\n\nIn our design considerations we address two types of\ninstrumental errors, namely the offset and scale errors.\n\nThus, in some cases, when a measured value has a systematic offset of a few pm, there are may be instrumental\nerrors that lead to further offset errors. There are many\nsources of offset (additive) errors caused by imperfect optics or imperfectly aligned optics at the pm level; there\nalso many sources for scale errors. We take a comfort\nin the fact that, for the space-based stellar interferometry, we have an ongoing technology program at JPL; not\nonly this program has already demonstrated metrology\naccurate to a sub-pm level, but has also identified a number of the error sources and developed methods to either\neliminate them or to minimize their effect at the required\nlevel.\nThe second type of error is a scale error. For instance,\nin order to measure \u03b3 to one part in 108 the laser frequency also must be stable to at least to 10\u22128 long term;\nthe lower accuracy would result in a scale error. The measurement strategy adopted for LATOR would require the\nlaser stability to only \u223c1% to achieve accuracy needed to\nmeasure the second order gravity effect. Absolute laser\nfrequency must be known to 10\u22129 in order for the scaling error to be negligible. Similarly robust solutions were\ndeveloped to address the effects of other known sources\nof scale errors.\nThere is a considerable effort currently underway at\nJPL to evaluate a number of potential errors sources for\nthe LATOR mission, to understand their properties and\nestablish methods to mitigate their contributions. (A\ncareful strategy is needed to isolate the instrumental effects of the second order of smallness; however, our experience with SIM [25, 26, 27] is critical in helping us\nto properly capture their contribution in the instrument\nmodels.) The work is ongoing, this is why the discussion\nbelow serves for illustration purposes only. We intend\nto publish the corresponding analysis and simulations in\nthe subsequent publications.\n\nA.\n\nOptical Performance\n\nThe laser interferometers use \u223c2W lasers and \u223c20\ncm optics for transmitting the light between spacecraft.\nSolid state lasers with single frequency operation are\nreadily available and are relatively inexpensive. For SNR\npurposes we assume the lasers are ideal monochromatic\nsources (with \u03bb = 1.3 \u03bcm). For simplicity we assume\nthe lengths being measured are 2AU = 3 \u00d7 108 km. The\nbeam spread is estimated as \u223c 1 \u03bcm/20 cm = 5 \u03bcrad (1\narcsec). The beam at the receiver is \u223c1,500 km in diameter, a 20 cm receiver will detect 1.71 \u00d7 102 photons/s\nassuming 50% q.e. detectors. Given the properties of the\nCCD array it takes about 10 s to reach the desirable SNR\nof \u223c 2000 targeted for the detection of the second order\neffects. In other words, a 5 pm resolution needed for a\nmeasurement of the PPN parameter \u03b3 to the accuracy of\none part in \u223c 108 is possible with \u2248 10 s of integration.\nAs a result, the LATOR experiment will be capable\nof measuring the angle between the two spacecraft to\n\n\f14\nTABLE I: LATOR Mission Summary: Science Objectives\n\u2022 To search for cosmological remnants of scalar field in the solar system.\n\u2022 To access the most intense gravitational environment in the solar system and test\na number of dynamical scenarios in this new field-strength regime.\n\u2022 To measure the key Eddington parameter \u03b3 with accuracy of 1 part in 108 , a factor\nof 3,000 improvement in the tests of gravitational light deflection.\n\u2022 To directly measure the PPN parameter \u03b2 to \u223c 1% accuracy\n\u2022 To measure effect of the second order light deflection with accuracy of \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\nincluding first ever measurement of the PPN parameter \u03b4.\n\u2022 To measure the solar quadrupole moment (using the theoretical value of the solar\nquadrupole moment J2 \u2243 10\u22127 ) to 1 part in 20.\n\u2022 To directly measure the frame dragging effect on the light with \u223c 1\u00d710\u22122 accuracy.\n\n\u223c 0.05 prad, which allows light deflection due to gravitational effects to be measured to one part in 108 . Measurements with this accuracy will lead to a better understanding of gravitational and relativistic physics.\nIn our analysis we have considered various potential\nsources of systematic error. This information translates\nto the expected accuracy of determination of the differential interferometric delay of \u223c \u00b15.4 pm, which translates\nin the measurement of the PPN parameter \u03b3 with accuracy of \u03c3\u03b3 \u223c 0.9 \u00d7 10\u22128 . This expected instrumental\naccuracy is clearly a very significant improvement compared to other currently available techniques. This analysis serves as the strongest experimental motivation to\nconduct the LATOR experiment.\n\nB.\n\nExpected Measurement Accuracy\n\nHere we summarize our estimates of the expected accuracy in measurement of the relativistic parameters of interest. The first order effect of light deflection in the solar\ngravity caused by the solar mass monopole is \u03b11 = 1.75\narcsec; this value corresponds to an interferometric delay of d \u2243 b\u03b11 \u2248 0.85 mm on a b = 100 m baseline.\nUsing laser interferometry, we currently able to measure\ndistances with an accuracy (not just precision but accuracy) of \u2264 1 pm. In principle, the 0.85 mm gravitational\ndelay can be measured with 10\u22129 accuracy versus 10\u22125\navailable with current techniques. However, we use a conservative estimate of 10 pm for the accuracy of the delay\nwhich would lead to a single measurement of \u03b3 accurate\nto 1 part in 108 (rather than 1 part in 109 ), which would\nbe already a factor of 3,000 accuracy improvement when\ncompared to the recent Cassini result [15].\nFurthermore, we have targeted an overall measurement\naccuracy of 10 pm per measurement, which for b = 100 m\nthis translates to the accuracy of 0.1 prad \u2243 0.02 \u03bcas.\nWith 4 measurements per observation, this yields an accuracy of \u223c 5.8\u00d710\u22129 for the first order term. The second\norder light deflection is approximately 1700 pm and with\n10 pm accuracy and the adopted measurement strategy\n\nit could be measured with accuracy of \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 , including first ever measurement of the PPN parameter\n\u03b4. The frame dragging effect would be measured with\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 accuracy and the solar quadrupole moment\n(using the theoretical value of the solar quadrupole moment J2 \u2243 10\u22127 ) can be modestly measured to 1 part in\n20, all with respectable SNRs (see Table I).\nThe final error would have contributions from multiple\nmeasurements of the light triangle's four attributes (to\nenable the redundancy) taken by range and interferometer observations at a series of times. The corresponding\nerrors will be combined with those from orbital position\nand velocity coordinate uncertainty. These issues are currently being investigated in the mission covariance analysis; the detailed results of this analysis will be reported\nelsewhere. However, our current understanding of the\nexpected mission and instrumental accuracies suggests\nthat LATOR will offer a very significant improvement\ncompare to any other available techniques. This conclusion serves as the strongest experimental motivation to\nconduct the LATOR experiment.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nConcluding, we would like to summarize the most significant results of our LATOR mission study. The most\nnatural question is \"Why is LATOR potentially orders\nof magnitude more sensitive and less expensive?\"\nFirst of all, there is a significant advantage in using\noptical wavelengths as opposed to the microwaves \u2013 the\npresent navigational standard. This is based on the fact\nthat solar plasma effects decrease as \u03bb2 and, in the case\nof LATOR, we gain a factor of 1010 reduction in the solar\nplasma optical path fluctuations by simply moving from\n\u03bb = 10 cm to \u03bb = 1 \u03bcm. Another LATOR's advantage is\nits independence of a drag-free technology. In addition,\nthe use of a redundant optical truss offers an excellent\nalternative to an ultra-precise orbit determination. This\nfeature also makes LATOR insensitive to spacecraft buffeting from solar wind and solar radiation pressure.\n\n\f15\nFurthermore, the use of existing technologies, laser\ncomponents and spacecraft make this mission a low cost\nexperiment. Thus, 1 W lasers with sufficient frequency\nstability and > 10 years lifetime already developed for optical telecom and also are flight qualified for SIM. Additionally, small optical apertures \u223c10-20cm are sufficient\nand provide this experiment with a high signal-to-noise\nratio. There also a significant advantage in using components with no motorized moving parts. This all makes\nLATOR an excellent candidate for the next flight experiment in fundamental physics. Table I summarizes the\nscience objectives for this mission.\nThe LATOR mission aims to carry out a test of the curvature of the solar system's gravity field with an accuracy\nbetter than 1 part in 108 . In spite of the previous space\nmissions exploiting radio waves for tracking the spacecraft, this mission manifests an actual breakthrough in\nthe relativistic gravity experiments as it allows to take\nfull advantage of the optical techniques that recently became available. The LATOR experiment has a number\nof advantages over techniques that use radio waves to\nmeasure gravitational light deflection. The optical technologies allows low bandwidth telecommunications with\nthe LATOR spacecraft. The use of the monochromatic\nlight enables the observation of the spacecraft almost at\nthe limb of the Sun. The use of narrowband filters, coronagraph optics and heterodyne detection will suppress\nbackground light to a level where the solar background\nis no longer the dominant noise source. The short wavelength allows much more efficient links with smaller apertures, thereby eliminating the need for a deployable antenna. Finally, the use of the ISS enables the test above\nthe Earth's atmosphere \u2013 the major source of astrometric noise for any ground based interferometer. This fact\njustifies LATOR as a space mission.\nThe LATOR mission will utilize several technology solutions that recently became available. In particular, signal acquisition on the solar background will be done with\na full-aperture narrow band-pass filer and coronagraph.\nThe issue of the extended structure vibrations of the will\nbe addressed by using \u03bc-g accelerometers. (The use of the\naccelerometers was first devised for SIM, but at the end\n\ntheir utilization is not needed. The Keck Interferometer\nuses accelerometers extensively.) Finally, the problem\nof monochromatic fringe ambiguity that complicated the\ndesign of the previous version of the experiment [23] and\nled to the use of variable baselines lengths \u2013 is not an issue for LATOR. This is because the orbital motion of the\nISS provides variable baseline projection that eliminates\nthis problem for LATOR.\nThe LATOR experiment technologically is a very\nsound concept; all technologies that are needed for its\nsuccess have been already demonstrated as a part of the\nJPL's interferometry program. The LATOR experiment\ndoes not need a drag-free system, but uses a geometric\nredundant optical truss to achieve a very precise determination of the interplanetary distances between the two\nmicro-spacecraft and a beacon station on the ISS. The\ninterest of the approach is to take advantage of the existing space-qualified optical technologies leading to an\noutstanding performance in a reasonable mission development time. The availability of the ISS makes this mission concept realizable in the very near future; the current mission concept calls for a launch as early as in 2011\nat a cost of a NASA MIDEX mission.\nThis mission may become a 21st century version of\nMichelson-Morley experiment in the search for a cosmologically evolved scalar field in the solar system. As such,\nLATOR will lead to very robust advances in the tests of\nfundamental physics: it could discover a violation or extension of GR, or reveal the presence of an additional\nlong range interaction in the physical law. There are no\nanalogs to the LATOR experiment; it is unique and is a\nnatural culmination of solar system gravity experiments.\n\n[1] I.I. Shapiro, C.C.Counselman, III, and R.W. King, Phys.\nRev.
