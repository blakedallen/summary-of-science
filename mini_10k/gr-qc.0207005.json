Introduction\nIn recent years the topic of the general relativistic post\u2013Newtonian effects of order O(c\u22122 ) on various features of the motion of spinning particles freely orbiting\na central astronomical body has received great attention both theoretically and\nexperimentally. More precisely, when a spinning particle moves in an external gravitational field one has to describe both its spin precession and the influence of the\nspin on its trajectory1.\nThe geodetic, or De Sitter, precession2 refers to the coupling of the static, gravitoelectric part of the gravitational field due to the Schwarzschild metric generated\nby a central, non\u2013rotating object to the spin of a particle freely orbiting around it.\nIt has been measured for the Earth\u2013Moon orbit, thought of as a giant gyroscope, in\nthe gravitational field of the Sun with 1% accuracy3. It should be measured for four\nsuperconducting gyroscopes in the gravitational field of the Earth by the important\nGP-B mission4 at a claimed relative accuracy level of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125. Finally, it might be\npossible to detect it also in some binary pulsar systems5 .\nThe Lense\u2013Thirring drag of the inertial frames6 is an effect due to the stationary, gravitomagnetic part of the gravitational field of a rotating central mass with\nproper angular momentum J on the geodesic path of a freely falling test particle,\ni.e. considered to be not spinning itselfa . In 1998 the first evidence of the Lense\u2013\na Such\n\neffect could be thought of as a spin\u2013orbit interaction between the spin of the central object\nand the orbital angular momentum of the test body. For some spin\u2013orbit effects induced by the\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLorenzo Iorio\n\nThirring effect in the gravitational field of the Earth has been reported8 with a\nclaimed accuracy of almost 20%. It is based on the analysis of the laser\u2013ranging\ndata of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II geodetic satellites. The launch of the proposed LAGEOS\u2013like LARES satellite9 could allow to measure such effect with an\naccuracy probably better than 1%. Another interesting gravitomagnetic effect of order O(c\u22122 ) on the orbit of a test particle has been recently derived in reference10 ; it\nis due to the temporal variability of the Earth's angular momentum. Unfortunately,\nit is too small to be detected with Satellite Laser Ranging.\nThe spin of the central object affects also the spin of a particle freely orbiting\nit in a way discovered by Schiff11 in 1959. The detection of this subtle precessional\neffect, in addition to the geodetic precession, is one of the most important goals of\nthe GP-B mission4 ; the claimed accuracy amounts to 1%.\nIn this paper we are interested in looking for some orbital effects due to the spin\u2013\nspin gravitational coupling on the geodesic path of a spinning extended particle with\nmass m and proper angular momentum s freely orbiting around a central body of\nmass M and proper angular momentum J. The gravitational spin\u2013spin coupling in\nthe quantum mechanical domain has been treated in references12, 13 .\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive the gravitational Stern\u2013\nGerlach force with some simplifying assumptions. In Section 3 we work out the\nlong\u2013term orbital effects of such interaction on the Keplerian orbital elements of\nthe moving particle. In Section 4 we look at the Sun\u2013Mercury system and to PSR\nB1259-63 and PSR B1913+16 in order to see if the predicted effect could be measured. Section 5 is devoted to the conclusions.\n2. The gravitomagnetic Stern\u2013Gerlach force\nIn the context of the linearized gravitoelectromagnetism it turns out that a gravitomagnetic dipole moment for a gyroscope of spin s is12\ns\n\u2192\n\u2212\n(1)\n\u03bcg = \u2212\nc\nand the energy of interaction with an external gravitomagnetic field Bg is\ns * Bg\n\u2192\n.\n(2)\nH = \u2212\u2212\n\u03bc g * Bg =\nc\nSince, in general, the gravitomagnetic field is position\u2013dependent, a Stern\u2013Gerlach\nforce arises from Equation (2)\nF = \u2212\u2207H.\n\n(3)\n\nLet us consider a central spherical rotating body as source of the gravitomagnetic\nfield, so that\n\u0010\n\u0011 i\nGJ h\nBg = \u2212 3 J\u02c6 \u2212 3 J\u02c6 * r\u0302 r\u0302 ,\n(4)\ncr\nrotation of the Sun on the orbital angular momentum of the Earth\u2013Moon system see reference7 .\n\n\fA gravitational spin\u2013spin effect\n\n3\n\nwhere G is the Newtonian gravitational constant, J\u02c6 is the unit vector along the\nproper angular momentum of the central body and r\u0302 is the unit position vector.\nBy assuming J = J \u1e91 in an inertial frame with the {x, y} plane coinciding with the\nequatorial plane of the central mass, Equation (3) becomes\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0014 \u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n5x z\n5xz 2\n5xyz\n3GJ\n+ sz\n\u2212 z + sy\n\u2212x ,\n(5)\nFx = 2 5 sx\nc r\nr2\nr2\nr2\n\u0012 2\n\u0012\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n3GJ\n5xyz\n5y z\n5yz 2\nFy = 2 5 sx\n+\ns\n\u2212\nz\n+\ns\n\u2212y ,\n(6)\ny\nz\nc r\nr2\nr2\nr2\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n3GJ\n5xz 2\n5yz 2\n5z 3\nFz = 2 5 sx\n\u2212\nx\n+\ns\n\u2212\ny\n+\ns\n\u2212 3z .\n(7)\ny\nz\nc r\nr2\nr2\nr2\nEquation (5)- Equation (7) agree with the expression\ni\no\n3GJ nh\nF= 2 4\n5(s * r\u0302)(J\u02c6 * r\u0302) \u2212 s * J\u02c6 r\u0302 \u2212 (s * r\u0302)J\u02c6 \u2212 (J\u02c6 * r\u0302)s\nc r\n\n(8)\n\nof Equation (22) in reference12 and with the first term of Equation (2) in reference1 .\n3. The orbital effects\nNow, let us work out the long\u2013term orbital effects on the orbit of a spinning particle. We will consider it as an extended spherical bodyb of radius l and (slowly)\nspinning with an angular velocity \u03b1, so that s = 52 ml2 \u03b1.

Then, they follow a phenomenological approach not based a priori\non General Relativity.\n\n\f4\n\nLorenzo Iorio\n\nthe orbiter, a, e, i, \u03a9, \u03c9 and M are the orbiter's semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of the ascending node, argument of perigee and mean\n\u221a anomaly,\n2\nrespectively. Moreover, p = a(1 \u2212 e ), f is the true anomaly and n = GM a\u22123 is\nthe Keplerian mean motion.\nNow we will derive the components R, T, N from Equation (5)- Equation (7).\nIn order to simplify the problem we will assume to consider only equatorial orbits.\nMoreover, we will further assume that the proper angular momentums of the two\nbody are aligned, i.e. s = sk\u0302 as well. This is a situation quite common, e.g., with\nthe planets and their moons in the Solar System to which our attention will be\ndrawn. Indeed, even if of order O(c\u22122 ), the investigated effects are very small due\nto the dependence on r\u22124 , as can be noticed from Equation (5)- Equation (7) and\nby considering that x, y, z are all proportional to r; so, only astronomical bodies\ncould yield a chance for measuring them.\nLet us make the x axis coincide with the line of the nodes: in this case\nx\u0302 = cos(\u03c9 + f )r\u0302 + cos i sin(\u03c9 + f )t\u0302 + sin i sin(\u03c9 + f )n\u0302,\n\n(15)\n\n\u0177 = \u2212 sin(\u03c9 + f )r\u0302 + cos i cos(\u03c9 + f )t\u0302 + sin i cos(\u03c9 + f )n\u0302,\n\n(16)\n\n\u1e91 = \u2212 sin i t\u0302 + cos i n\u0302,\n\n(17)\n\nand\nx = r cos(\u03c9 + f ),\n\n(18)\n\ny = r cos i sin(\u03c9 + f ),\n\n(19)\n\nz = r sin i sin(\u03c9 + f ).\n\n(20)\n\nWith Equation (16)- Equation (20), Equation (5)- Equation (7) become, in the\ncase of equatorial orbits\n3GJs\ncos [2(\u03c9 + f )] ,\nc2 r 4\n3GJs\nT = \u2212 2 4 sin [2(\u03c9 + f )] ,\nc r\nN =0\nR = \u2212\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\ns\nwhere s = m\n= 25 l2 \u03b1.

A Solar System scenario\nIn order to measure the small effects predicted by Equation (26)- Equation (27)\nthe most suitable system seems to be the Sun\u2013Mercury one.

A pulsar scenario\nLet us try to see if the predicted effects could be measured in an astrophysical\ncontext. The binary systems in which at least one member is a pulsar neutron star\nseem to be the optimal choice due to the large values of the eccentricity of the\norbits of a not negligible fraction of them (70 out of more than 1300 known, i.e.\nabout 5%). Moreover, the rapid rotations of the pulsars and the relatively small\nseparations between the members of such systems could be helpful.\nAs can be inferred from Table 2, obtained from the datad in reference17 , the PSR\nB1259-63 system seems to be a good choice (See, e.g., http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/\u223c\npulsar/ for a quick outlook of the discovered pulsars and their relevant orbital\nparameters). Of course, in that case our calculations should be considered as very\npreliminary order\u2013of\u2013magnitude estimates, just to understand if looking at pulsars\nmore thoroughly and carefully could be fruitfully or not.

It should be noticed\nthat in applying our results to PSR B1259-63 the following caveat hold. Neither\nthe orbit of the pulsar can be considered equatoriale , nor the spin J of SS 2883 is\nvertical17 . Moreover, we can calculate s for the pulsar, but we cannot say anything\nabout its direction. On other hand, the value can be inferred for J is plausible\nbecause the stars of the same type of SS 2883 are well known.\nBy using the values of Table 2 we obtain for the periastron advance\n\u001c \u001d\nd\u03c9\n= \u2212(3.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 deg/y) \u00d7 sin 2\u03c9.\n(30)\ndt PSR B1259\u2212\u221263\nNotice that the period of the secular precession of the perigee of PSR B1259\u201363\namounts to 1.9\u00d7106 yearsf , so that over reasonable observational time spans of\nfew years the predicted harmonics would be similar to secular trends. According to\nTable 1 of reference17 , the experimental sensitivity amounts to 10\u22126 deg/y for h\u03c9\u0307i,\nso that also in this case the gravitomagnetic spin\u2013spin interaction turns out to be\ntoo small to be detected.\nA more favorable situation occurs for the well known binary pulsar system of\nPSR B1913+16 in which the companion of the pulsar is probably another neutron\nstar.

Conclusions\nIn this paper, in the linearized approximation of gravitoelectromagnetism and at\norder O(c\u22122 ), we have calculated the influence of the spin s of a particle on its\ngeodesic orbital motion in an external gravitomagnetic field generated by a rotating body with spin J. It has been assumed that the orbit lies in the equatorial plane\nof the central object and that the spins are both vertical to it. The orbital\u2013averaged,\nlong\u2013term effects on the Keplerian orbital elements of the orbiter have been calculated by neglecting all terms of order O(e2 ). It turns out that the eccentricity, the\npericenter and the mean anomaly are affected by such spin\u2013spin gravitomagnetic interaction by means of harmonic perturbations with half the period of the pericenter.\nIn order to see if they are measurable, we have examined two possible astronomical\nscenarios: the Sun\u2013Mercury system and a pair of binary millisecond pulsar systems.\nIt turns out that they are far too small. Only for the pulsar PSR1913+16 the predicted periastron rate is not too far from the present experimental sensitivity. The\npossible discovery of new, highly eccentric and close binary pulsar systems, together\nwith notable improvements of the accuracy in measuring the periastron rates could\ngive some hopes to detect such tiny effects in future.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank H.
