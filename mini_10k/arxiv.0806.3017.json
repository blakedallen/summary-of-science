Concerning the Newtonian\ncase, I use the Gauss equations for the variation of the elements and\nobtain negative secular rates for the osculating semimajor axis a, the\neccentricity e and the mean anomaly M, while the argument of pericenter \u03c9 does not experience secular precession; the longitude of the\nascending node \u03a9 and the inclination i remain unchanged as well. The\nanomalistic period is different from the Keplerian one: it turns out\nto be larger than it. The true orbit, instead, expands, as shown by a\nnumerical integration of the equations of motion with MATHEMATICA; in fact, this is in agreement with the seemingly counter-intuitive\ndecreasing of a and e because they refer to the osculating Keplerian\nellipses which approximate the trajectory at each instant. A comparison with the results obtained with different approaches by other\nresearchers is made. General relativity induces positive secular rates\nof the semimajor axis and the eccentricity completely negligible in the\npresent and future evolution of the solar system.\n\nKeywords gravitation; stars: mass-loss; celestial mechanics\nPACS 95.30.Sf; 97.10.Me; 95.10.Ce\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper I investigate the classical orbital effects induced by an isotropic\nvariation \u1e40 /M of the mass of a central body on the motion of a test particle; my analysis is valid also for a change \u0120/G of the Newtonian constant\nof gravitation. This problem, although interesting in itself, is not only an\nacademic one because of the relevance that it may have on the ultimate\ndestiny of planetary companions in many stellar systems in which the host\n1\n\n\fstar experiences a mass loss, like our Sun [1]. With respect to this aspect,\nmy analysis may be helpful in driving future researches towards the implementation of long-term N-body simulations including the temporal change\nof GM as well, especially over timescales covering paleoclimate changes, up\nto the Red Giant Branch (RGB) phase in which some of the inner planets\nshould be engulfed by the expanding Sun. Another problem, linked to the\none investigated here, which has recently received attention is the observationally determined secular variation of the Astronomical Unit [2, 3, 4, 5].\nMoreover, increasing accuracy in astrometry pointing towards microarcsecond level [6], and long-term stability in clocks [7] require to consider the\npossibility that smaller and subtler perturbations will be soon detectable in\nthe solar system. Also future planetary ephemerides should take into account \u1e40 /M . Other phenomena which may, in principle, show connections\nwith the problem treated here are the secular decrease of the semimajor axes\nof the LAGEOS satellites, amounting to 1.1 mm d\u22121 , [8] and the increase\nof the lunar orbit's eccentricity of 0.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 yr\u22121 [9].\nMany treatments of the mass loss-driven orbital dynamics in the framework of the Newtonian mechanics, based on different approaches and laws\nof variation of the central body's mass, can be found in literature; see, e.g.,\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 4] and references therein. However, they\nare sometimes rather confused and involved, giving unclear results concerning the behavior of the Keplerian orbital elements and the true orbit.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a theoretical description of the phenomenon in a two-body scenario. By working in\nthe Newtonian framework, I will analytically work out the changes after\none orbital revolution experienced by all the Keplerian orbital elements of a\ntest particle moving in the gravitational field of a central mass experiencing\na variation of its GM linear in time. Then, I will clarify the meaning of\nthe results obtained by performing a numerical integration of the equations\nof motion in order to visualize the true trajectory followed by the planet.\nConcerning the method adopted, I will use the Gauss perturbation equations [19, 20], which are valid for generic disturbing accelerations depending\non position, velocity and time, the \"standard\" Keplerian orbital elements\n(the Type I according to, e.g., Ref. [16]) with the eccentric anomaly E as\n\"fast\" angular variable. Other approaches and angular variables like, e.g.\nthe Lagrange perturbation equations [19, 20], the Type II orbital elements\n[16] and the mean anomaly M could be used, but, in my opinion, at a price\nof major conceptual and computational difficulties1 . With respect to possi1\n\nThink, e.g., about the cumbersome expansions in terms of the mean anomaly and the\n\n2\n\n\fble connections with realistic situations, it should be noted that, after all,\nthe Type I orbital elements are usually determined or improved in standard\ndata reduction analyses of the motion of planets and (natural and artificial)\nsatellites. Instead, my approach should, hopefully, appear more transparent and easy to interpret, although, at first sight, some counter-intuitive\nresults concerning the semimajor axis and the eccentricity will be obtained;\nmoreover, for the chosen time variation of the mass of the primary, no approximations are used in the calculations which are quite straightforward.\nHowever, it is important to stress that such allegedly puzzling features are\nonly seemingly paradoxical because they will turn out to be in agreement\nwith numerical integrations of the equations of motion, as explicitly shown\nby the numerous pictures depicted. Anyway, the interested reader is advised\nto look also at Ref. [16] for a different approach. In Section 3 I will work\nwithin the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic framework by calculating the gravitoelectric effects on all the Keplerian orbital elements of a\nfreely falling test particle in a non-stationary gravitational field. Section 4\nis devoted to a discussion of the findings of other researchers and contains\nsome numerical calculations concerning the previously mentioned orbital\nphenomena of LAGEOS and the Moon. Section 5 summarizes my results.\n\n2\n\nAnalytical calculation of the orbital effects by\n\u03bc\u0307/\u03bc\n\nBy defining\n\u03bc \u2261 GM\n\n(1)\n\nat a given epoch t0 , the acceleration of a test particle orbiting a central body\nexperiencing a variation of \u03bc is, to first order in t \u2212 t0 ,\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n\u03bc\u0307\n\u03bc\n\u03bc(t)\n(t \u2212 t0 ) r\u0302,\n(2)\nA = \u2212 2 r\u0302 \u2248 \u2212 2 1 +\nr\nr\n\u03bc\nwith \u03bc\u0307 \u2261 \u03bc\u0307|t=t0 . \u03bc\u0307 will be assumed constant throughout the temporal\ninterval of interest \u2206t = t \u2212 t0 , as it is, e.g., the case for most of the\nremaining lifetime of the Sun as a Main Sequence (MS) star [1]. Note that \u03bc\u0307\ncan, in principle, be due to a variation of both the Newtonian gravitational\nconstant G and the mass M of the central body, so that\n\u0120 \u1e40\n\u03bc\u0307\n= +\n.\n\u03bc\nG M\n\n(3)\n\nHansen coefficients, the subtleties concerning the choice of the independent variable in the\nLagrange equations for the semimajor axis and the eccentricity [19].\n\n3\n\n\fMoreover, while the orbital angular momentum is conserved, this does not\nhappen for the energy.\nBy limiting ourselves to realistic astronomical scenarios like our solar\nsystem, it is quite realistic to assume that\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03bc\u0307\n(t \u2212 t0 ) \u226a 1\n(4)\n\u03bc\nover most of its remaining lifetime: indeed, since \u1e40 /M is of the order of2\n10\u221214 yr\u22121 for the Sun [1], the condition (4) is satisfied for the remaining3\n\u2248 7.58 Gyr before the Sun will approach the RGB tip in the HertzsprungRussell Diagram (HRD). Thus, I can treat it perturbatively with the standard methods of celestial mechanics.\nThe unperturbed Keplerian ellipse at epoch t0 , assumed coinciding with\nthe time of the passage at perihelion tp , is characterized by\nr = a(1 \u2212 e cos E),\ndt =\n\n1\u2212e cos E\nn\n\ncos f =\nsin f =\n\n\u0001\n\ndE,\n\ncos E\u2212e\n1\u2212e cos E ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\n\n1\u2212e2 sin E\n1\u2212e cos E ,\n\nwhere a and e are the semimajor axis and the eccentricity, respectively,\nwhich\nfix the size and the shape of the unchanging Keplerian orbit, n =\np\n3\n\u03bc/a is its unperturbed Keplerian mean motion, f is the true anomaly,\nreckoned from the pericentre, and E is the eccentric anomaly. This would\nbe the path followed by the particle for any t > tp if the mass loss would\nsuddenly cease at tp . Instead, the true path will be different because of\nthe perturbation induced by \u03bc\u0307 and the orbital parameters of the osculating\nellipses approximating the real trajectory at each instant of time will slowly\nchange in time.\n2\n\nAbout 80% of such a mass-loss is due to the core nuclear burning, while the remaining\n20% is due to average solar wind.\n3\nThe age of the present-day MS Sun is 4.58 Gyr, counted from its zero-age MS star\nmodel [1].\n\n4\n\n\f2.1\n\nThe semimajor axis and the eccentricity\n\nThe Gauss equation for the variation of the semimajor axis a is [19, 20]\n\u0010 p \u0011i\nh\nda\n2\n,\n(6)\n= \u221a\neAr sin f + A\u03c4\ndt\nr\nn 1 \u2212 e2\n\nwhere Ar and A\u03c4 are the radial and transverse, i.e. orthogonal to the direction of r\u0302, components, respectively, of the disturbing acceleration, and\np = a(1 \u2212 e2 ) is the semilatus rectum. In the present case\nA \u2261 Ar = \u2212\n\n\u03bc\u0307\n(t \u2212 tp ),\nr2\n\n(7)\n\ni.e. there is an entirely radial perturbing acceleration. For \u03bc\u0307 < 0, i.e. a\ndecrease in the body's GM , the total gravitational attraction felt by the\ntest particle, given by (2), is reduced with respect to the epoch tp . In order\nto have the rate of the semimajor axis averaged over one (Keplerian) orbital\nrevolution (7) must be inserted into (6), evaluated onto the unperturbed\nKeplerian ellipse with (5) and finally integrated over ndt/2\u03c0 from 0 to 2\u03c0\nbecause n/2\u03c0 = 1/P Kep (see below).

Moreover,\nI found that the Keplerian period P Kep decreases, while one would expect\nthat the orbital period increases.\nIn fact, there is no contradiction, and my analytical results do yield us\nrealistic information on the true evolution of the planetary motion. Indeed,\na, e and P Kep refer to the osculating Keplerian ellipses which, at any instant,\napproximate the true trajectory; it, instead, is not an ellipse, not being\nbounded. Let us start at tp from the osculating pericentre of the Keplerian\nellipse corresponding to chosen initial conditions: let us use a heliocentric\nframe with the x axis oriented along the osculating pericentre. After a\ntrue revolution, i.e. when the true radius vector of the planet has swept\nan angular interval of 2\u03c0, the planet finds itself again on the x axis, but\nat a larger distance from the starting point because of the orbit expansion\ninduced by the Sun's mass loss. It is not difficult to understand that the\nosculating Keplerian ellipse approximating the trajectory at this perihelion\npassage is oriented as before because there is no variation of the (osculating)\n7\n\n\fy, AU\n\n0.4\n0.2\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\nx, AU\n\n-0.5\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\nFigure 1: Black continuous line: true trajectory obtained by numerically\nintegrating with MATHEMATICA the perturbed equations of motion in\nCartesian coordinates over 2 yr; the disturbing acceleration (2) has been\nadopted. The planet starts from the perihelion on the x axis. Just for\nillustrative purposes, a mass loss rate of the order of 10\u22122 yr\u22121 has been\nadopted for the Sun; for the planet initial conditions corresponding to a = 1\nAU, e = 0.8 have been chosen. Red dashed line: unperturbed Keplerian\nellipse at t = t0 = tp . Blue dash-dotted line: osculating Keplerian ellipse\nafter the first perihelion passage. As can be noted, its semimajor axis and\neccentricity are clearly smaller than those of the initial unperturbed ellipse.\nNote also that after 2 yr the planet has not yet reached the perihelion as\nit would have done in absence of mass loss, i.e. the true orbital period is\nlonger than the Keplerian one of the osculating red ellipse.\n\n8\n\n\fargument of pericentre, but has smaller semimajor axis and eccentricity.\nAnd so on, revolution after revolution, until the perturbation theory can be\napplied, i.e. until \u03bc\u0307/\u03bc(t \u2212 tp ) << 1. In Figure 1 the situation described so\nfar is qualitatively illustrated. Just for illustrative purposes I enhanced the\noverall effect by assuming \u03bc\u0307/\u03bc \u2248 10\u22122 yr\u22121 for the Sun; the initial conditions\nfor the planet correspond to an unperturbed Keplerian ellipse with a = 1 AU,\ne = 0.8 with the present-day value of the Sun's mass in one of its foci. It is\napparent that the initial osculating red dashed ellipse has larger a and e with\nrespect to the second osculating blue dash-dotted ellipse. Note also that the\ntrue orbital period, intended as the time elapsed between two consecutive\ncrossings of the perihelion, is larger than the unperturbed Keplerian one of\nthe initial red dashed osculating ellipse, which would amount to 1 yr for the\nEarth: indeed, after 2 yr the planet has not yet reached the perihelion for\nits second passage.\nNow, if I compute the radial change \u2206r(E) in the osculating radius vector\nas a function of the eccentric anomaly E I can gain useful insights concerning how much the true path has expanded after two consecutive perihelion\npassages. From the Keplerian expression of the Sun-planet distance\nr = a(1 \u2212 e cos E)\n\n(22)\n\none gets the radial component of the orbital perturbation expressed in terms\nof the eccentric anomaly E\n\u2206r(E) = (1 \u2212 e cos E) \u2206a \u2212 a cos E \u2206e + ae sin E \u2206E;\n\n(23)\n\nit agrees with the results obtained by, e.g., Casotto in Ref.

[14] uses a tangential perturbing acceleration\nproportional to the test particle's velocity v,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u03bc\u0307\nA=\u2212\nv,\n(56)\n2 \u03bc(t)\nand a different perturbative approach by finding that, for a generic mass loss,\nthe semimajor axis secularly increases and the eccentricity remains constant.\nIn fact, with the approach followed here it would be possible to show that,\nto first order in (\u03bc\u0307/\u03bc)(t \u2212 t0 ), h\u0227i = \u2212(\u03bc\u0307/\u03bc)a and h\u0117i = 0 and that the true\norbit is expanding, although in a different way with respect to (2) as depicted\nby Figure 7 in which the magnitude of the mass-loss has been exaggerated\nfor better showing its orbital effects. However, it must be noted that a term\nlike (56) is inadmissible in any relativistic theory of gravitation because it\nviolates the Lorentz invariance. Indeed, this fact is explicitly shown for\ngeneral relativity by Bini et al. in Ref. [26] where the full equations of\nmotion of a test particle in a non-stationary gravitoelectromagnetic field are\nworked out (see, eq. (14) of Ref. [26]). In deriving them it is admitted that,\nin general, \u03a6 = \u03a6(t, r), but no gravitoelectric terms like (56) occur. Instead,\n(2) is compatible with eq. (14) of Ref. [26].\nSchr\u00f6der and Smith in Ref. [1], by assuming the conservation of the\nangular momentum, derive the orbital expansion by means of equations\nvalid, instead, for orbits with constant radius only, i.e. v 2 /r = \u03bc(t)/r 2\nand L p\n= vr. Then, they assume that not only v but also r vary and put\nv(t) = \u03bc(t)/r, which is, instead, valid for circular orbits of constant radius\nonly, into L = v(t)r(t) = vr getting \u03bc(t)r(t) = \u03bcr, where in my notation r\nand \u03bc refers to the initial epoch t0 . With such an approach they obtain an\nexpanded terrestrial orbit up to about 2 times larger than mine.\nNoerdlinger in Ref. [4], following Jeans [12] and Kevorkian and Cole [18],\nassumes for the variation of a quantity identified by him with the semimajor\naxis the following expression\na(t)\u03bc(t) = a\u03bc :\n\n(57)\n\nthus, his semimajor axis gets larger. Note that such an equation is the same\nobtained by Ref. [1]. By assuming a variation of \u03bc linear in time (57) would\n20\n\n\fy, AU\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n-0.25\n\nx, AU\n\n-0.5\n-0.75\nFigure 7: Black continuous line: true trajectory obtained by numerically\nintegrating with MATHEMATICA the perturbed equations of motion in\nCartesian coordinates over 2 yr ; the disturbing acceleration (56) has been\nused.

Just for illustrative purposes, a mass loss rate of the order of \u221210\u22121 yr\u22121 has been adopted\nfor the Sun; for the planet initial conditions corresponding to a = 1 AU,\ne = 0.8 have been chosen. Red dashed line: unperturbed Keplerian ellipse\nat t = t0 = tp . Blue dash-dotted line: osculating Keplerian ellipse after the\nfirst perihelion passage.

Note also that after 2 yr the planet has not yet reached the perihelion\nas it would have done in absence of mass loss.\n\n21\n\n\fyield an increase of a according to\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03bc\u0307\n\u0227 = \u2212\na > 0;\n\u03bc\n\n(58)\n\ncfr. with my (9). As a consequence of the constancy of L2 = \u03bc(t)a(t)[1 \u2212\ne(t)2 ] and of (57) he obtains that the eccentricity remains constant, i.e.\n\u0117 = 0;\n\n(59)\n\ncfr. with my (12). Moreover, another consequence of (57) obtained by\nNoerdlinger in Ref. [4] is that the Keplerian period increases as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bc 2\nP Kep (t)\n;\n=\nP Kep\n\u03bc(t)\n\n(60)\n\ncfr. with my (16). Should the quantities dealt with by Noerdlinger are to be\nidentified with the usual osculating Keplerian elements, his results would be\nincompatible with the real dynamics of a test particle in the field of a linearly\nmass-losing body, as I have shown. The quantity obtained by us which\nexhibits the closest resemblance with (58) seems to be the secular variation\nof \u2206r(2\u03c0) for e = 0. Apart from matters of interpretation, the quantitative\nresults are different. Indeed, I obtain for the Earth a secular variation of\nthe semimajor axis of \u22122 \u00d7 10\u22124 m yr\u22121 and a shift in the radial position\nalong the fixed line of the apsides of +1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 m yr\u22121 , while Noerdlinger\nin Ref. [4] gets a secular rate of his semimajor axis, identified with the\nAstronomical Unit, of about +1 \u00d7 10\u22122 m yr\u22121 . Note that Noerdlinger uses\nfor the Sun \u1e40 /M = \u22129 \u00d7 10\u221214 yr\u22121 as in the present work.\nKrasinski and Brumberg in Ref. [2] deal, among other things, with the\nproblem of a mass-losing Sun in the framework of the observed secular increase of the Astronomical Unit for which, starting with an equation of\nmotion like (2), they obtain an equation like (58). A mass-loss rate of\n\u22123 \u00d7 10\u221214 yr\u22121 , considered somewhat underestimated by Noerdlinger [4],\nyields an increase of the Astronomical Unit of 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 m yr\u22121 . With such a\nvalue for \u03bc\u0307/\u03bc I would obtain a decrease of the semimajor axis of \u22127 \u00d7 10\u22125\nm yr\u22121 and an increase in r of +4 \u00d7 10\u22123 m yr\u22121 .\nConcerning the observationally determined increase of the Astronomical\nUnit, more recent estimates from processing of huge planetary data sets by\nPitjeva point towards a rate of the order of 10\u22122 m yr\u22121 [28, 29]. It may\nbe noted that my result for the secular variation of the terrestrial radial\nposition on the line of the apsides would agree with such a figure by either\n22\n\n\fassuming a mass loss by the Sun of just \u22129 \u00d7 10\u221214 yr\u22121 or a decrease of the\nNewtonian gravitational constant \u0120/G \u2248 \u22121 \u00d7 10\u221213 yr\u22121 . Such a value for\nthe temporal variation of G is in agreement with recent upper limits from\nLunar Laser Ranging [30] \u0120/G = (2 \u00b1 7) \u00d7 10\u221213 yr\u22121 . This possibility is\nenvisaged in Ref. [31] whose authors use \u0227/a = \u2212\u0120/G by speaking about a\nsmall radial drift of \u2212(6 \u00b1 13) \u00d7 10\u22122 m yr\u22121 in an orbit at 1 AU. I, now,\napply my analysis to the daily decrement of the semimajor axis of LAGEOS\n[8] whose relevant orbital parameters are a = 12270 km, e = 0.0045. From\n(9) it turns out that a secular decrease of a of the order of \u2248 1 mm d\u22121\ncould only be induced by \u03bc\u0307\u2295 /\u03bc\u2295 = \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22126 yr\u22121 . Clearly, it cannot be\ndue to a variation of the Earth's mass M ; if it had to be attributed to a\nvariation of G, it would be orders of magnitude too large with respect to\nthe bounds in Ref. [30] and Ref. [31]. Adopting (28) does not substantially\nalter the situation because the required \u03bc\u0307\u2295 /\u03bc\u2295 would be only two orders of\nmagnitude smaller. Now I look at the anomalous increase of the eccentricity\nof the lunar orbit amounting to \u0117Moon = (0.9 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u221211 yr\u22121 [9]. Such a\nfigure and (12) yield \u03bc\u0307\u2295 /\u03bc\u2295 = 8.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 yr\u22121 ; it is one order of magnitude\nlarger than the present-day bounds on \u0120/G [30, 31].\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nI started in the framework of the two-body Newtonian dynamics by using a\nradial perturbing acceleration linear in time and straightforwardly treated\nit with the standard Gaussian scheme. I found that the osculating semimajor axis a, the eccentricity e and the mean anomaly M secularly decrease\nwhile the argument of pericentre \u03c9 remains unchanged; the longitude of the\nascending node \u03a9 and the inclination i are not affected by the phenomenon\nconsidered. The radial distance from the central body, taken on the fixed\nline of the apsides, experiences a secular increase \u2206r. For the Earth, such\nan effect amounts to about 1.3 cm yr\u22121 . By numerically integrating the\nequations of motion in Cartesian coordinates I found that the real orbital\npath expands after every revolution, the line of the apsides does not change\nand the apsidal period is larger than the unperturbed Keplerian one. I\nhave also clarified that such results are not in contrast with those analytically obtained for the Keplerian orbital elements which, indeed, refer to\nthe osculating ellipses approximating the true trajectory at each instant. I\nalso computed the orbital effects of a secular variation of the Sun's mass in\nthe framework of the general relativistic linearized gravitoelectromagnetism\nwhich predicts a perturbing gravitoelectric tangential force proportional to\n\n23\n\n\fv/r. I found that both the semimajor axis and the eccentricity secularly\nincrease; the other Keplerian elements remain constant. Such effects are\ncompletely negligible in the present and future evolution of, e.g., the solar\nsystem.\nAs a suggestion to other researchers, it would be very important to\ncomplement my analytical two-body calculation by performing simultaneous\nlong-term numerical integrations of the equations of motion of all the major\nbodies of the solar system by including a mass-loss term in the dynamical\nforce models as well to see if the N-body interactions in presence of such\nan effect may substantially change the picture outlined here. It would be\nimportant especially in the RGB phase in which the inner regions of the\nsolar system should dramatically change.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank Prof. K.V.
