INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of the properties of flux line solids and liquids in high temperature superconductors (HTSC) has\nbeen, during the past few years, one of the most active areas of research in the field of superconductivity.\nOne theoretical approach that has had a rather strong\nimpact on our present understanding of flux liquids in\nHTSC is the boson mapping1\u20135 , which is based on the\nobservation6 that there is a formal mapping between the\npartition function of a three-dimensional system of interacting flux lines, and the imaginary-time partition function of quantum bosons in two-dimensions. One of the\nmain results of this approach, which has in fact been\nreproduced using other methods7 , is that the structure\nfactor\nS(r, z) = h\u03c1\u0302(r, z)\u03c1\u0302(0, 0)i\n\nD\u2248\n\nhu2 i \u2248 DL\n\n(1.4)\n\n,\n\nu(z) = r(z) \u2212 hr(z)i\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhich diverges with the superconducting sample thickness L.\nSince its inception by Nelson and Seung2 , the boson\nmapping has had a widespread acceptance and a rather\nstrong impact on our understanding of flux line liquids.\nIt has been applied, in particular, to disorder-free vortex\nliquids5 , as well as to vortex liquids in presence of point3\nand correlated8 disorder. In all these studies, the boson\nmapping gave seemingly reasonable results, except at one\noccurrence where it was noticed by T\u00e4uber and Nelson4\nthat the boson mapping gives nonsensical results in the\npresence of splayed columnar disorder9 .\nIn a recent manuscript10 , henceforth referred to as\n(I), I have proposed a new approach to study threedimensional flux line liquids in type II superconductors.\nThis approach, which makes contact with the standard\ntheory of classical fluids, is based on the separation of the\nflux lines' conformal variables into center of mass (c.m.)\nand internal modes, and on the observation that the interactions between flux lines may lead, under certain conditions, to the confinement of the internal modes whose\nfluctuations are now bounded and no-longer diverge with\nthe sample thickness L as in Eq. (1.5). While, as mentioned above, the Boson mapping does not deal with the\nconformation variables of flux lines themselves, the theory developed in (I) predicted that the effective Hamiltonian of the internal modes of interacting flux lines in a\nvortex liquid has the form (i here labels flux lines, and\nN is the total number of vortices in the sample)\n\n(1.1)\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03b5(q) is the excitation spectrum of the equivalent\nboson superfluid (whose precise form will be given below), and T is temperature (throghout this paper, we use\nunits such that Boltzmann's constant kB = 1). Although\nthe Boson mapping (and other similar approaches7 which\nuse the density as the basic dynamical variable) does not\nmake any explicit predictions for the correlations of conformational variables of flux lines, the exponential decay\n(1.2) of density correlations along the direction of the\nlines is generally interpreted as an indication that the\nflux line liquid is in a heavily entangled or \"superfluid\"\nstate characterized by correlations of the form\nh|r(z) \u2212 r(0)|2 i = 2D|z| ,\n\n,\n\nand by a mean projected area of the flux lines :\n\nof a liquid of flux lines described by the trajectories\nRi (z) = (ri (z), z) as they traverse the superconducting\nPN\nsample (here \u03c1\u0302(r, z) = i=1 \u03b4(r \u2212 ri (z)) is the density\noperator in the r = (x, y) plane at heigh z, N being the\ntotal number of vortices in the sample), is such that the\npartial Fourier transform S(q, z) = h\u03c1\u0302(q, z)\u03c1\u0302(\u2212q, 0)i is\ngiven by\nS(q, z) = S(q, z = 0) e\u2212\u03b5(q)|z|/T\n\nT\n\u03ba\n\nHef f [ui ] =\n\nN Z\nX\ni=1\n\n(1.3)\n\n0\n\nL\n\ndz\n\nh 1 \u0010 du \u00112 1\ni\ni\n+ \u03bc0 u2i (z)\n\u03ba\n2\ndz\n2\n\nwhere the mass \u03bc0 is given by\n1\n\n(1.6)\n\n\f\u03bc0 =\n\n\u03c1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 r \u22072 V (r)g0 (r) .\n\nto work in Fourier space, and to write down the following decomposition of the flux line trajectories ri (z, t) into\nRouse19 modes\n\n(1.7)\n\nIn the above equation, V is the interaction potential\nbetween vortices (see below, Eq. (2.1)) and g0 is the\npair distribution function of the two-dimensional liquid\nformed by the centers of mass of the flux lines. Because\nin (I) we only used a simple Taylor expansion of the total\nHamiltonian of flux lines in terms of the ui 's, the \"mass\"\nterm \u03bc0 does not fully capture the effect of thermal fluctuations, and varies with temperature only through the\n(weak) variation of g0 . In particular, Eq. (1.7) shows\nthat the value of the \"mass\" term \u03bc0 remains almost\nunchanged as temperature T \u2192 \u221e, which of course is\nunrealistic, since we expect the vortex liquid to behave\nas an ideal gas of freely fluctuating flux lines in this limit.\nIn the present paper, we generalize the method proposed in (I), and construct a variational theory of interacting flux lines in the vortex liquid state. This variational method, which in fact turns out to be nothing but\na self-consistent Hartree approximation, captures the effect of thermal fluctuations in a better way and leads to\na \"renormalized\" mass term \u03bc(T ) which vanishes at high\nenough temperatures, as suggested by physical intuition.\nOur method of approach will be as follows. In section\nII we construct our variational approach and derive the\nexpression of the renormalized \u03bc(T ). In section III, we\ncompare the method developed in (I) and in the present\npaper with the approaches of refs.1\u20135,7 , and discuss in\nparticular the interacting structure factor S(r, z) derived\nusing both methods. Section IV contains our conclusions.\n\nri (z) =\n\nIt will also be convenient to write ri (z) as the sum\nri (z) = r0i (t) + ui (z, t)\n\nn=1\n\n0\n\ndz\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere r0i (t) = ri (qn = 0, t) is the c.m. position and ui (z)\nthe flux line displacement with respect to the center of\nmass position at height z.\nThe statistical mechanics of the flux line system, Eq.\n(2.1), is described by the partition function\nZ=\n=\n\nZ Y\nN\n[dri (z)] e\u2212\u03b2H\n\n(2.5)\n\ni=1\n\nZ Y\nN\n\ndr0i\n\nZ Y\nN\n\n[dui (z)] e\u2212\u03b2H\n\n(2.6)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T is the inverse temperature, and where in\ngoing from the first to the second line we separated the\npath integral over every flux line trajectory into a path\nintegral over all internal modes and an ordinary integral over the c.m. coordinates. The integration measure\n[dui (z)] is given by\n\u221e\nY\n\ndure (qn ) duim (qn )\n\n(2.7)\n\nn=1\n\nWe thus consider a liquid of interacting flux lines\nin a d = (d\u22a5 + 1)-dimensional superconducting sample of thickness L. We here will use the following\nHamiltonian2,8\nL\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere qn = 2\u03c0n/L, and where the Fourier coefficients\nri (qn ) are given by\nZ\n1 L\nri (qn ) =\ndz ri (z) e\u2212iqn z\n(2.3)\nL 0\n\n[dui (z)] =\n\nN Z\nX\n\nri (qn )eiqn z\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nII. VARIATIONAL THEORY OF FLUX LINE\nLIQUIDS\n\nH=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nwith ure (qn ) and uim (qn ) the real and imaginary parts\nof u(qn ), respectively. Now, if we were able to perform\nthe functional integrations over the internal modes, such\nan integration would give us the expression\n\nn 1 \u0010 dr \u00112 1 X\n\u0001o\nn\nV rn (z)\u2212rm (z)\n+\n\u03ba\n2\ndz\n2\n\nZ=\n\nm(6=n)\n\n(2.1)\n\nZ Y\nN\n\ndr0i e\u2212\u03b2Hef f [{r0i }]\n\n(2.8)\n\ni=1\n\nwhich looks like the partition function of a system of\nN ordinary classical particles with spatial coordinates\n{r0i }, interacting through the Hamiltonian Hef f [{r0i }],\nand whose thermodynamics can be studied by standard\nmethods of statistical mechanics. Unfortunately, since\nthe internal modes {ui (z)} appear explicitely in the argument of the interaction potential V in Eq. (2.1), it is\nnot possible, in general, to perform the functional integrations over these variables in closed form. In (I), we\nused a simple Taylor expansion of the interaction potential V (ri (z) \u2212 rj (z)) = V (r0i \u2212 r0j + ui (z) \u2212 uj (z)) in\nterms of the ui 's to be able to perform the integrations in\n\nwhere \u03ba is the tilt modulus per unit length of the flux\nlines, and V (r) is the interaction potential between flux\nline elements at equal height z. For a uniaxial HTSC,\nwith both the average vortex direction and the unit vector \u1e91 aligned with the \u0109 axis, \u03ba \u2243 \u03b52 \u03b50 and V (r) =\n2\u03b50 K0 (r)/\u03bbab , where the energy scale \u03b50 is given by\n\u03b50 = (\u03c60 /4\u03c0\u03bb2ab )2 , \u03b5 = \u03bbab /\u03bbc is the ratio of the London penetration depths in the (ab) planes and in the\ndirection of the \u0109 axis, respectively; \u03c60 = hc/2e is the\nflux quantum, and K0 is a modified Bessel function18 . In\nthe developments that will follow, we will find it useful\n2\n\n\fEq. (2.6) and make predictions for physical observables\nof our flux liquid. Here, and in order to better capture\nthe effect of thermal fluctuations, we want to improve\non the above Taylor expansion and use a variational approach to derive the statistical mechanics of our model\nsystem.\nIn general, variational approaches to classical statistics\nare based on the Jensen-Peirels inequality21\nZ \u2265 Zv = Z1 e\u2212\u03b2hH\u2212H1 i1\n\nHu [{ui (z)}] describes the elasticity and mutual interactions of the internal modes of flux lines. For Hu [{ui (z)}],\nwe shall use the following Gaussian approximation (here\nand in the following, we sum over repeated indices unless\notherwise indicated) :\nZ Z\n1 X\ndz dz \u2032 [G\u22121 (z \u2212 z \u2032 )]ij ui (z) * uj (z \u2032 )\nHu =\n2L2 i,j\n\n(2.9)\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere H1 is any Hamiltonian, and where the average h* * *i1 is performed with the statistical weight\nexp(\u2212\u03b2H1 )/Z1 , with Z1 = T r(e\u2212\u03b2H1 ). While an arbitrary choice of H1 will not necessarily lead to good results, a judicious choice of the variational Hamiltonian\nH1 (that is simple enough so that thermal averages can\nbe calculated and at the same time general enough to\ncapture the physics of the full Hamiltonian) can lead to\na variational free energy\nFv = \u2212T ln Zv\n= \u2212T ln Z1 + hH \u2212 H1 i1\n\nThroughout the rest of the paper, it will be understood\nthat integrals over the z and z \u2032 variables run from 0 to L.\nThe above expression can be rewritten in Fourier space\nin the form\nHu =\n\n(2.13)\n\nn6=0\n\nIn Eqs. (2.12)-(2.13), [G\u22121 (qn )]ij is an N \u00d7 N matrix of\nvariational parameters describing the interactions of the\ninternal modes of flux lines23 . In the boson language, the\ndecomposition (2.11) of the total Hamiltonian into c.m.\nand internal modes pieces can be seen as the the generalization of the Feynman-Kleinert variational method20\nfor single quantum particles in imaginary time to an assembly of interacting quantum particles. Both quantities\nH0 and [G\u22121 (qn )]ij will be determined variationally, and\none can in fact show, following ref. 28, that the Gaussian\napproximation (2.13), with the optimal choice for the\npropagator [G\u22121 (qn )]ij to be detemined below, becomes\nexact in the limit of a large number of components of the\ndisplacement field {ui (z)}.\nUsing the Hamiltonian H1 above, Eqs.(2.11)-(2.13), to\nevaluate the variational free energy in Eq. (2.10), we find\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhich is a very good approximation of the true free energy of the sytem, and to an accurate description of the\noverall behaviour of the original model.\nWe now have to choose a variational Hamiltonian to\napproximate the Hamiltonian H of equation (2.1).

(2.20b) being\nfinite and independent of the total number of vortices N ,\nwe see that the off-diagonal elements [G\u0303\u22121 (qn )]i6=j vanish\nin the thermodynamic N \u2192 \u221e limit, in which case the\ninternal modes elastic propagator is diagonal and given\nby:\n[G\u0303\u22121 (qn )]ij = L(\u03baqn2 + \u03bc) \u03b4ij\n\nFrom Eq. (2.22), it is not possible to derive a general expression of the coefficient \u03bc without making assumptions about the analytic form of the pair correlation function g0 (r). Here, we shall place ourselves in the\ncase of a dilute flux liquid and use the analytical ansatz\nwe proposed in (I) for the pair correlation function g0 (r),\nnamely :\ng0 (r) = 1 \u2212 \u03b7 exp(\u2212\u03b1r2 /a2 )\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant of order unity, and 0 < \u03b7 < 1. The\nnumerical constant \u03b7 quantifies the correlations between\nc.m. positions of flux lines. It is close to unity when flux\nlines are strongly anti-correlated due to the repulsive interactions between their surrounding supercurrents, and\nclose to zero in situations where there is considerable cutting and crossing of flux lines. Using the above ansatz for\ng0 (r), we obtain the following expression for the \"mass\"\n\u03bc of the internal modes as a function of T :\n\n(2.21)\n\nwith \u03b4ij the Kronecker delta symbol and where \u03bc is given\nby:\nZ\n2\n2\n\u03c1\nq 2 V (q)g0 (q)e\u2212q hu i/d\u22a5\n(2.22)\n\u03bc=\u2212\nd\u22a5 q\nIn the above equation, the mean square width of a flux\nline\nX\nhu2 i = d\u22a5 T\nG\u0303(qn )\n\n\u03bc(T ) = \u03bc0\n\nn6=0\n\nd\u22a5 T\n= \u221a\n4 \u03ba\u03bc\n\n(2.24)\n\n!\n\u00112 \u0010 \u03b1T\n\u0011 2\n\u03b1T\n\u2212\n1+\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4a2 \u03ba\u03bc0\n4a2 \u03ba\u03bc0\n\ns\n\n\u0010\n\n(2.25)\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 = \u03bc(T = 0) = 2\u03b7\u03c0\u03c1\u03b50 /d\u22a5 . Fig.1 shows a plot of\n\u221a\n\u03bc(T )/\u03bc0 as a function of the variable \u03bd = \u03b1T /4a2 \u03ba\u03bc0 .\nFrom Eq. (2.25), it is not difficult to see that the above\nexpression has the limiting value \u03bc(T ) \u2192 \u03bc0 when T \u226a\n\u221a\n\u221a\na2 \u03ba\u03bc0 , while at higher temperatures T \u226b a2 \u03ba\u03bc0 ,\n\u221a\n\u03bc(T ) \u2243 \u03bc0 (4a2 \u03ba\u03bc0 /\u03b1T ) and goes to zero like 1/T . We\nthus see that hu2 i in Eq. (2.23) will vary with temperature like T 3/2 . More generally, any nontrivial form of the\npair distribution function g0 (r) in Eqs. (2.20a)-(2.20b)\nwill result in a nontrivial temperature dependence of\n\u03bc(T ) and hence of the mean projected area of a flux line\nhu2 i. This temperature variation of hu2 i can be measured\nin numerical simulations and is actually a good way to\ntest the predictions of the present paper. Note also that\n\ndepends on \u03bc. Thus we see that Eq. (2.22) is in fact\na self-consistent equation for the \"mass\" coefficient \u03bc.\nFrom this last equation, we also see that \u03bc depends on\nthe density \u03c1 of flux lines, not only through the prefactor in front of the integral, but also through the pair\ndistribution function g0 (r). Through this last quantity,\n\u03bc also depends on temperature and on higher, nontrivial correlations between the positions of flux lines in the\nvortex liquid. The strongest dependence of \u03bc on temperature, however, occurs through the \"Debye-Waller\" factor\n2\n2\ne\u2212q hu i/d\u22a5 which was missing in our more elementary\nTaylor expansion in (I), and which describes the effect of\ninternal fluctuations of flux lines.\n4\n\n\fhu2 i = d\u22a5 T\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\nX\n\nG(qn )\n\n(3.3)\n\nn6=0\n\n0.8\n\nHaving derived the structure factor through our approach, we want to compare it to the corresponding quantity derived through the Boson mapping and similar approaches.

Since this last type of approach only makes\npredictions for correlations of coarse-grained variables,\nsuch as the density, and makes no predictions for microscopic conformation variables of the flux lines, we here\nshall focus on comparing the interacting structure factor\nS(r, z) obtained through both methods.\nLet us first start by deriving the structure factor of a\nliquid of flux lines from our variational approach. This\ncan be done in a straightforward way, with the result\n(Appendix B) :\nhu2 i/d\u22a5\n\n+ \u03c1e\n\n\u2212 2d1 q2 \u03c6(z)\n\u22a5\n\n\u03c1 e\u2212\u03b5(q)|z|/T\n=p\n1 + 4\u03c1V (q)\u03ba/(T q)2\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe first note that the above analytic form of the structure factor, Eq. (3.1), and the hydrodynamic result (3.6)\ncannot be brought to agreement. In other words, no\nGaussian approximation of the form (2.13) can produce\na structure factor of the form (3.6).\nAs we already mentioned in the introduction, it has\nalready been noticed4,9 that the boson mapping gives\nnonsensical results when applied to flux liquids in the\npresence of splayed columnar disorder. In Appendix B,\nwe comment on the definition of the chemical potential\nof flux lines in the boson mapping, which appears to us a\nlittle problematic. While this may be considered to be a\nrather \"cosmetic\" issue, in what follows we show that the\nboson mapping yields other unphysical results (in addition to those aleady noticed in ref.4 ) even in the simplest\ncase of pure, disorder free vortex liquids. To this end,\nlet us make the following two observations regarding the\nanalytic form of S(q, z) in the boson scheme :\n(i) By taking the limit \u03ba \u2192 \u221e in equation (3.4), one\nshould be able to obtain the structure factor of a liquid\nof rigid flux lines, which we expect to be independent of\nz. Taking the above limit in equation (3.6), we see that\nthe z-dependence does indeed cancel out, since \u03b5(q) \u2192 0\nas \u03ba \u2192 \u221e. However, the prefactor\n\n(3.1)\n\nLet us insist that this result is actually very general, and\nonly requires that an approximate decomposition of the\nform (2.11) can be written for the Hamiltonian of the flux\nlines in terms of the conformational degrees of freedom\nof flux lines, and that the internal modes of flux lines\nobey a Gaussian distribution such as the one implied by\nEq. (2.13). Whith these assumptions, the mean square\nrelative displacement in Eq. (3.1), for an arbitrary form\nof the propagator Gij (qn ) in Eq. (2.13), is given by (here\nG(qn ) is the diagonal element Gii (qn )) :\n\u03c6(z) = h[ui (z) \u2212 ui (0)]2 i\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= 2d\u22a5 T\nG(qn ) 1 \u2212 cos(qn z)\n\n(3.5)\n\nFrom equation (3.4), it is not difficult to obtain that the\npartial Fourier transform S(q, z) has the the following\nexpression\nZ \u221e\ndqz\nS(q, qz ) eiqz z\nS(q, z) =\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n\nIII. THE INTERACTING STRUCTURE FACTOR\nOF FLUX LINE LIQUIDS\n\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere the excitation spectrum of the equivalent bosons\nhas the usual form\n\n\u03ba\u03bc0 .\n\nas T becomes very large, \u03bc(T ) vanishes and we recover a\nliquid of freely fluctuating flux lines with hu2 i diverging\nwith the sample thickness L.\n\nS(q, z) = \u03c12 g0 (q) e\u2212q\n\n\u03c1T q 2 /\u03ba\nqz2 + \u03b52 (q)/T 2\n\n(3.2)\n\nS(q, z = 0) =\n\nn6=0\n\nwhile the mean projected area of a given flux line is given\nby\n\n\u03c1T q 2 /\u03ba\n\u03c1\n\u0001=p\n2 \u03b5(q)/T\n1 + 4\u03c1V (q)\u03ba/(T q)2\n\nalso goes to zero in the limit \u03ba \u2192 \u221e, which means that\nthe whole structure factor S(q, z = 0) will vanish as \u03ba\n5\n\n\fgets very large, which is not exactly what we would expect for a liquid of rigid flux lines. In contrast to this\nbehaviour, the structure factor derived within our variational perturbation theory is well-behaved in the limit\n\u03ba \u2192 \u221e, and it is not difficult to see from Eqs. (3.1)-(3.3)\nthat we obtain, for an arbitrary choice of Gij (qn ) (with\neither \u03bc = 0 or a nonzero \u03bc), in the above limit :\n\u0002\n\u0003\nS(q, z) = \u03c1 1 + \u03c1 g0 (r)\n(3.7)\n\nindicating that the flux line densities \u03c1\u0302(q, z) at both sides\nz = 0 and z = L of a superconducting sample are not\nvery much decorrelated, in agreement with the experimental findings of ref. 22. In this reference, the authors\nhave performed a two-sided decoration experiment on\nboth sides of a superconducting sample, and observed\nthe same pattern of vortices in each case. If the structure factor obeyed the boson mapping result, Eq. (3.6),\nthe densities \u03c1\u0302(q, 0) and \u03c1\u0302(q, L) would have been completely decorrelated and very different from one another.\nThe fact that both density patterns in the experiments\nof ref. 22 look exactly the same might be evidence of the\nfact that there is a strong correlation between \u03c1\u0302(q, 0) and\n\u03c1\u0302(q, L), and that S(q, z) is finite in the limit z \u2192 \u221e.\nIn fact, one can even attempt a slightly more quantitative comparison of our results, Eqs. (3.11)-(3.12),\nand the experimental findings of ref. 22. From Eqs.\n(3.11)-(3.12), it is not difficult to see that the ratio\nS(q, z = 0)/S(q, z = L) is of order unity for q not too\nclose to 0, and is such that\n\nwhich is the correct result for a liquid of rigid hard rods.\n(ii) For an \"ideal gas\" of non-interacting flux lines, the\nmean projected area hu2 i of a given flux line is given by\nhu2 i =\n\nd\u22a5 T L\n12\u03ba\n\n(3.8)\n\nand the mean square displacement \u03c6(z) is given by\n\u03c6(z) =\n\n2T\n|z|\n\u03ba\n\n(3.9)\n\nUsing these expressions in Eq. (3.1) above, one finds, for\nnon-interacting flux lines in the thermodynamic (L \u2192\n\u221e) limit,\n\u0010 T q2 \u0011\nSid. (q, z) = \u03c1 exp \u2212\n|z|\n2\u03ba\n\nS(q, z = 0)\n\u2192 1 as q \u2192 0\nS(q, z = L)\n\nin agreement with the decoration experiments of Yoon et\nal. It would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis\nof the experimental results in light of the present model\n(taking into account nonlocal elasticity27 ), as such an\nanalysis may lead to values of the elastic constants of the\nflux lattice (in particular, of the tilt modulus \u03ba) which\nare closer to the conventional values of these quantities\n(recall that the analysis of the experiments of ref. 22 using the boson mapping yields elastic constants which are\nthree to four orders of magnitude below what is expected\nfrom the standard theory of elacticity of vortices in uniaxial type II superconductors27,25,26 ).\n\n(3.10)\n\nComparing this expression to the expression (3.6) of the\nstructure factor of an interacting flux liquid in the boson\nmapping and given the expression (3.5) of the Boguliubov spectrum, we see that, at any given value of q,\nS(q, z) decays more rapidly as a function of z than its\nfree counterpart Sid. (q, z). This result is very surprizing,\nto say the least, as it is very difficult to imagine a flux\nline assembly where the density decorrelates on shorter\nlength scales and vortices fluctuate more strongly than\nin an \"ideal gas\" of freely fluctuating flux lines. Indeed,\nthe effect of the repulsive interactions between flux lines\nis to reduce the fluctuations of vortices, as is evidenced\nat the freezing transition: in the absence of interactions,\na liquid of vortices would never freeze into a vortex solid\nand would continue to have large fluctuations, Eqs. (3.8)(3.9), down to T = 0. Going back to equation (3.1), it\nis not difficult to verify that our result for the structure\nfactor does not exhibit the above behaviour. With the\nparticular choice (2.24) for the pair distribution function\ng0 (r), we obtain10\n\u2212 \u221aq\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, in this paper we have extended the approach developed in (I) to better take into account the\neffect of thermal fluctuations of flux lines in vortex liquids. Using a variational Hartree approximation, we\nhave shown that thermal fluctuations strongly reduce the\n\"mass\" term which confines the fluctuations of the internal modes of flux lines. We have also argued that our\napproach, which is based on the use of the conformation\nvariables {rn (z)} as the true dynamical variables in terms\nof which all (Gaussian) averages are taken, yields physically more reasonable results than the boson mapping2\u20134\nor other hydrodynamic approaches7 which, in contrast,\nuse the density \u03c1\u0302(r, z) as the basic dynamical variable of\nthe system. In (I), we had argued that a careful numerical measurement of the pair distribution function for the\nc.m. mode g0 (r) could shed more light on the confining\nmass term \u03bc0 in a vortex liquid. Here, we have shown\n\n2T\n\nS(q, z) = \u03c12 g0 (q)e 4 \u03ba\u03bc(T ) +\n\u0010\n\u221a\n\u0001\u0011\nT q2\n(3.11)\n1\u2212e\u2212 \u03bc(T )/\u03ba|z|\n+ \u03c1 exp \u2212 p\n2 \u03ba\u03bc(T )\n\nwhich has the following, nonvanishing limit as z \u2192 \u221e\nS(q, z \u2192 \u221e) = \u03c12 g0 (q)e\n\n\u2212 \u221aq\n4\n\n2T\n\n\u03ba\u03bc(T )\n\n(3.13)\n\n\u0010\nT q2 \u0011\n+ \u03c1 exp \u2212 p\n2 \u03ba\u03bc(T )\n\n(3.12)\n6\n\n\fthat a numerical measurement of the temperature dependence of the mean square projected area of flux lines\ncan also be used to test the predictions of the present\napproach.

APPENDIX C : CHEMICAL POTENTIAL OF\nA FLUX LINE LIQUID\n\nIn this appendix, we briefly comment on the \"chemical\npotential\" of a flux line liquid adopted in references2,3,8,4,\nwhich seems to us to be a little unconventional. In what\nfollows, we shall be considering, in the notation of the\ntext, a flux line liquid in a superconducting sample of\nthickness L along the \u1e91 axis. We will call \u03a9 the area of\nthe sample in the (x, y) plane. The self energy per unit\nlength of a single flux line will be denoted by \u03b51 , and is\ngiven by \u03b51 = \u03b50 ln(\u03bbab /\u03beab ), where \u03bbab and \u03beab are the\nLondon penetration depth and the coherence length in\nthe basal (ab) plane. The magnitude of the magnetic induction inside the sample will be denoted by B, and it is\nrelated to the flux line density \u03c1 = N/\u03a9 by B = \u03c1\u03c60 .\nTo start with, we make the observation that the chemical potential per unit length of a system of N flux lines\ncan be easily obtained using the thermodynamic identity\n(the chemical potential here should not be confused with\nthe mass of the internal modes of flux lines)\n\u03bc=\n\n1 \u2202F\nL \u2202N\n\n\u03bc = (H\u03c60 /4\u03c0) \u2212 \u03b51\nwhich does not coincide with expression (7.3).\n\nAt the origin of this disagreement is a confusion in terminology that is worth clarifying. When we use terms\nsuch as \"chemical potential\" in vortex physics, we are\nborrowing a terminology whose most natural realm is\nthe theory of gases and liquids. There, one defines the\nHelmholtz free energy F by Fliq = \u2212T ln Z, where Z is\nthe canonical partition function of the system (we use\nthe subscript liq to distinguish quantities pertaining to\nliquid state theory from quantities in vortex physics bearing the same name). Fliq contains information about the\ninteractions among the particles in the system and possibly, as is the case for vortices, about their self-energies.\nOne also defines a Gibbs free energy Gliq by Gliq = \u03bcN ,\nwhere \u03bc = (\u2202Fliq /\u2202N ) is the chemical potential. In the\ngrand-canonical ensemble, the grand canonical potential\nQgr = \u2212T ln Zgr can be written in terms of Fliq and Gliq\nas Qgr = Fliq \u2212 Gliq = Fliq \u2212 \u03bcN . For homogeneous systems, the equilibrium density of particles \u03c1 is obtained\nby minimizing the quantity (Qgr /V ) = f \u2212 \u03bc\u03c1, using the\nequation\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere F is the Helmholtz free energy of the flux line\nsystem. Using the fact that the free energy per unit volume f = F/(\u03a9L) satisfies the following thermodynamic\nequality\nH\n\u2202f\n=\n\u2202B\n4\u03c0\n\n(7.2)\n\n\u2202Qgr\n=0\n\u2202\u03c1\n\nand remembering that B = n\u03c60 = N \u03c60 /\u03a9, we readily\nobtain\n\u03bc=\n\nH\u03c60\n4\u03c0\n\nG=\n\n\u03b51\n\nZ\n\n1X\n2\n\nZ\n\ni=1\n\n+\n\n\u03b4Qgr\n=0\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\ni6=j\n\nBH\n4\u03c0\n\n(7.8)\n\nThis last equality is in fact the expression of the second\nHohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theorem14,15 which is the basis\nof density functional theories of classical liquids.\n\n\u00111/2\n\u0010\n+\ndz 1 + (dri /dz)2\ndz V [ri (z) \u2212 rj (z)] \u2212 V\n\n(7.7)\n\nor if a one body external potential is present, using a\nfunctional derivative\n\n(7.3)\n\nInstead of the Helmholtz free energy F , Nelson and\nSeung2 consider the Gibbs free energy G = F \u2212\nV (BH/4\u03c0), which for a system of flux lines is given by :\nN\nX\n\n(7.6)\n\nIn the case of flux line systems, what we call Gibbs\nfree energy G = F \u2212V (BH/4\u03c0) corresponds to the grand\ncanonical potential Qgr of liquid state theory, as can easily be seen by comparing the definition of G for vortices,\nG = F \u2212L(\u03c60 H/4\u03c0)N , to Qgr = F \u2212\u03bcN , and remembering that the equilibrium density of flux lines \u03c1 = B/\u03c60 is\nobtained in a way reminiscent of equation (7.7), i.e.\n\n(7.4)\n\nwhere V (r) = 2\u03b50 K0 (r/\u03bbab ) is the interaction potential\nbetween flux line elements at height z. Upon expanding\nthe square root on the rhs of this last equation, and readjusting the tilt modulus \u03b51 \u2192 \u03ba = \u03b52 \u03b51 to take anisotropy\ninto account, (and using the fact that the volume V = \u03a9L\nand B = N \u03c60 /\u03a9), they obtain :\n\n\u2202G\n\u2202G\n=\n=0\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202B\n\nN Z\nH\u03c60 \u0011\n1 X\nG = \u03b51 \u2212\nNL + \u03ba\ndz (dri /dz)2 +\n4\u03c0\n2 i=1\nZ\n1X\ndz V [ri (z) \u2212 rj (z)]\n(7.5)\n+\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n(7.9)\n\nThe fact that G for magnetic systems corresponds to the\ngrand canonical potential has been recognized a long time\nago by de Gennes13 , who obtained the pressure in the flux\nline system as P = \u2212(\u2202G/\u2202\u03a9), which is reminiscent of\n\ni6=j\n\n9\n\n\f1\n\nthermodynamic relation Qgc = \u2212P V (with V the volume\nof the system). In view of the fact that the Helmholtz free\nenergy F has the same meaning in liquid state theory and\nfor magnetic systems, one is led to identify V (BH/4\u03c0)\nwith the Gibbs free energy \u03bcN of liquid state theory, and\nthis identification leads to the result (7.3) for the chemical potential per unit length of the flux line system (see\nalso the table below, which contains a summary of the\ncorrespondence between flux line and liquid quantities)\n\nD.R.
