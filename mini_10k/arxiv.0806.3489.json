Here we investigate spiral line-defects in cardiac tissue where period-2 behavior has a\nknown arrhythmogenic role. We find that the number of line defects, which is constrained to be an odd integer,\nis three for a freely rotating spiral, with and without meander, but one for a spiral anchored around a fixed\nheterogeneity. We interpret analytically this finding using a simple theory where spiral wave unstable modes\nwith different numbers of line-defects correspond to quantized solutions of a Helmholtz equation. Furthermore,\nthe slow inward rotation of spiral line-defects is described in different regimes.\n\nSpiral waves are observed in extremely diverse physical and\nbiological excitable media and are known to play a key role in\nthe genesis of abnormally rapid life-threatening heart rhythm\ndisorders [1]. Despite considerable progress to date, complex\nspatiotemporal behaviors resulting from unstable spiral wave\npropagation remain poorly understood theoretically with the\nexception of meander [2, 3], a classic spiral core instability\nwith flower-like tip trajectories. A particularly rich dynamics results from instabilities in period-2 media where the local\ndynamics of the medium, i.e. the dynamics of uncoupled excitable elements, exhibits a period-doubling bifurcation as a\nfunction of parameters of the medium or the external stimulation frequency. Although period-2 behavior has been seen in\ndifferent excitable and oscillatory media, it has received particular attention in a cardiac context. The hallmark of period-2\nbehavior in this context is alternans, a beat-to-beat alternation\nin the duration of cardiac excitation, which has been linked to\nthe onset of lethal heart rhythm disorders [4].\nUnstable spiral wave propagation in period-2 media is invariably accompanied by \"line-defects\", which are the locus\nof points where the dynamics is locally period-1. Line-defects\nare generally present in these media when plane waves radiating out of the core region are unstable at the spiral rotation\nperiod, independently of whether meander is present or not.\nStudies in in vitro cardiac cell tissue cultures [5, 6], chemical\nreactions [7, 8, 9], and coupled oscillators [10, 11] have revealed the existence of a rich variety of patterns ranging from\none and three line-defect structures [8], to phase bubbles [12],\nto line-defect turbulence [13]. Spiral wave breakup in models\nof cardiac excitation has also been found in parameter regimes\nof local period-2 dynamics, and hypothesized in this context\nas a potential mechanism for heart fibrillation [1, 14, 15, 16].\nSpiral line-defect patterns, however, have not been systematically investigated in cardiac tissue.\nIn this Letter, we investigate the selection and dynamics of\nline-defect patterns resulting from unstable spiral wave propagation in cardiac tissue. Moreover, we interpret our findings\nusing an amplitude equation framework recently used to study\nthe evolution of line-defects during periodic stimulation from\na single site [17]. In this framework, the spatiotemporal modulation of the phase and amplitude of period-2 oscillations is\ndescribed by a simple partial differential equation that can be\n\nreadily analyzed. Our study is based on the standard wave\nequation for cardiac tissue\n\u2202t V = \u03b3\u22072 V \u2212 Im (V, ~y )/Cm ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V is the transmembrane voltage, \u03b3 is the voltage diffusion coefficient, Cm is the membrane capacitance, and ~y is a\nvector of gate variables that controls the flow of ions through\nthe membrane, and hence the total membrane ionic current\nIm . We studied different models of Im (V, ~y ) and gating kinetics to explore universal features of line-defect patterns that\ndepend on qualitative properties of core and plane wave instabilities. The latter are manifested either as stationary [17, 18]\nor traveling [17] spatial modulations of period-2 oscillation\namplitude with an intrinsic spatial scale determined by parameters of the excitable medium [17]. These spatial modulations have nodes with period-1 dynamics in one dimension,\nor nodal lines in two, which correspond here to line-defects\nin the spiral far-field. We therefore chose models to explore\nline-defect patterns for stationary and traveling nodes with and\nwithout meander. The model of Ref. [15] has pinwheel spirals\n(no meander) and stationary nodes under periodic pacing. The\nother two models of Ref. [19] and Ref. [17] both exhibit meander and have fixed and traveling nodes, respectively.\nFreely propagating spiral waves in all three models were\nstudied by numerically solving Eq. (1) in a circular domain of radius re = 3 cm with no-flux boundary condition, \u2202r V |r=re = 0. Anchored spirals were studied by introducing an inexcitable disk of radius ri and imposing noflux conditions on both the inner and outer radii, \u2202r V |r=ri =\n\u2202r V |r=re = 0. We implemented the phase-field method of\nRef. [20] that automatically handles no-flux boundary conditions in an arbitrary geometry using a finite-difference representation of the Laplacian on a square grid, and iterated Eq. (1)\nusing a simple explicit Euler scheme. Model parameters are\nidentical to the published ones except those listed in Fig. 1.\nThe latter were chosen for intermediate action potential duration restitution slopes, which suffice to produce unstable spiral waves with line-defects in each geometry, but are not steep\nenough to cause wave breakup in this domain size.\nWe used a half plane wave as initial condition to initiate a\nspiral wave (obtained by first triggering a full plane wave and\nresetting part of the circular domain to the resting state). To\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic illustration of transitions from (a) three to one\nand (b) one to three line-defects and corresponding examples from\nsimulations of the model of Ref. [15] with the same conventions and\nparameters as in Fig. 1 (b). The small circle (green online) in (a) and\n(b) represents the spiral core region or a small anchoring obstacle.\n\nFIG. 1: Membrane voltage (left) and corresponding alternans amplitude a (right) for different ionic models and geometries: model of\nRef. [15] without (a and b; Re = 1.15) and with a circular inexcitable disk of radius ri = 0.5 cm (c and d; Re = 1.25), and model\nof Ref. [19] without disk (e and f; tf 2 = 30 ms, tsi = 10 ms,\nth2 = 2.0 ms). In panels (a), (c), and (e), grey (orange online) indicates depolarization, and white indicates the trajectory of the spiral\ntip. In panels (b), (d), and (f), dark grey (red online) and light grey\n(yellow online) correspond to a > 0 and a < 0 regions, separated\nby line-defects (solid lines); the grey (color online) scale does not\nvary outside the indicated range of a. Line-defects in (b), (d), and\n(f), rotate counterclockwise with a period that is approximately 17,\n8, and 9 times the clockwise spiral rotation period in (a), (c), and\n(e), respectively. The discontinuity of a across the dashed line is a\nconsequence of the definition of the common beat number (see text).\n\ntrack line defects, we define at each point x and time t a local\nbeat number n(x, t), set everywhere initially to zero after the\nhalf plane wave is created, and increased by one at the end of\neach action potential, i.e. every time that the voltage V (x, t)\ncrosses a fixed threshold Vc with dV /dt < 0. We then define\nthe period-2 alternans amplitude as\na(x, t) = (\u22121)nc (t) [D(x, nc (t)) \u2212 D(x, nc (t) \u2212 1)] /2\n(2)\nR\nwhere D(x, n) = V (x,t\u2032 )>Vc ,n(x,t\u2032 )=n\u22121 dt\u2032 is the local action potential duration (APD) and nc (t) \u2261 minx n(x, t) is the\ncommon beat, i.e. the largest beat number that has been registered at all points at time t. The line-defects are then the locus\nof points where a(x, t) = 0 at any instant of time. The use\nof a common beat number introduces here a discontinuity in a\n(indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 1) since the APD of a given\nbeat might change as the wave front rotates around the spiral\n\ntip. This discontinuity, however, does not affect the dynamics. Other methods to track line defects [7, 21] yield similar\nresults except for unessential imaging differences.\nResults of simulations that pertain to the selection of the\nnumber of line-defects are shown in Fig. 1. The top four panels reveal that the pinwheel spirals simulated with the twovariable model of Ref. [15] exhibit three line-defects when\npropagating freely in spatially homogeneous tissue, but only\none line-defect when anchored around an inexcitable disk of\n0.5 cm radius. Furthermore, the bottom two panels show that\nfor the more physiologically realistic three-variable model of\nRef. [19], freely propagating spirals still exhibit three-line defects even though the spiral tip meanders.\nSince anchored spirals become free in the limit of vanishing obstacle size, one would expect transitions from one to\nthree (three to one) line-defects to occur with decreasing (increasing) obstacle size. Indeed, for the model of Ref. [15], we\nfound three line defects for obstacles with diameter smaller\nthan \u223c 0.1 cm, including the freely propagating pinwheel spiral (ri = 0) in Fig. 1 (b), and one line defect for diameters\nlarger than \u223c 0.3 cm as in the example of Fig. 1 (d). For\nintermediate diameters, we found complex behaviors marked\nby transitions from three to one or one to three line-defects.\nThe former occur when two line defects merge into one line\ndefect that moves away from the core, and the latter when a\nphase bubble enclosed by a line-defect loop nucleates in, and\nexpands from, the core, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We find the\nsame qualitative behavior in the model of Ref. [19] except\nthat meander makes the transitions between patterns with different numbers of line-defects more complex.\nLet us now turn to interpret our results in the amplitude\nequation framework [17]. For simplicity, we restrict our analysis to non-meandering spiral waves. Furthermore, to keep\nthe analysis tractable, we first assume that the propagation\nwave speed is constant and relax this assumption subsequently\nwhen examining the motion of line defects. With this assumption, linear perturbations of a steady-state rigidly rotating spiral wave with period T obey the equation\nT \u2202t a = \u03c3a + \u03be 2 \u22072 a,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a is the alternans amplitude subject to the radial\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Theoretical radial and angular (insets) dependence of the\nalternans amplitude for (a) 1 and (b) 3 line defect modes.\n\n\u2202r a|ri = \u2202a|re = 0 and angular a(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0, t) = \u2212a(\u03b8, t)\nboundary conditions. The latter constrains the number of line\ndefects to be an odd integer and results from the change in\nbeat number across any closed circuit enclosing the spiral tip\nfor steady-state alternans. It follows directly from the definition of a [Eq. (2)] and the requirement that the voltage be continuous everywhere in space. In addition, \u03c3 = ln f \u2032 , where f \u2032 ,\nthe slope of the action potential duration restitution curve defined by Dn+1 = f (T \u2212 Dn ), controls the onset of alternans\nand \u03be \u223c (\u03b3D)1/2 , where D is the value of the action potential\nduration at the period-doubling bifurcation (\u03c3 = 0), measures\nthe scale over which the voltage dynamics is diffusively coupled on the time scale of one beat.\nThis linear stability problem is easily solved by the substitution a(r, t) \u223c e\u03a9t \u03a8(r, \u03b8) that transforms Eq. (3) into a\nHelmholtz equation for \u03a8(r, \u03b8). The latter can then be solved\nby separation of variables with the substitution \u03a8(r, \u03b8) \u223c\nR(r)\u0398(\u03b8). The angular part is found to be \u0398n (\u03b8) =\nsin ((n + 1/2)\u03b8), where mode n corresponds to 2n + 1 linedefects. The radial part obeys a Bessel equation. For ri > 0, it\n\u2032\nhas solutions Rn,m (r) \u221d J\u2212n\u22121/2\n(kn,m re )Jn+1/2 (kn,m r) \u2212\n\u2032\nJn+1/2 (kn,m re )J\u2212n\u22121/2 (kn,m r) that satisfy the outer radial\nboundary condition \u2202a|re = 0, where n, m = 0, 1, . . . , and\nthe inner condition \u2202r a|ri = 0 determines kn,m , and hence the\n2\ngrowth rate \u03a9n,m T = \u03c3 \u2212 \u03bere\u22122 kn,m\n. We find that the smallest kn,m occurs for n = 0 independently of the ratio re /ri .\nTherefore, the mode corresponding to a single line defect is\nthe most unstable when the spiral is anchored. This agrees\nwith our numerical observations in Fig. 1 (d). For freely rotating spirals, ri = 0, J\u2212n\u22121/2 (r) diverges at the origin, so the\nsolutions are Rn,m (r) \u221d Jn+1/2 (kn,m r), where knm re is the\nmth zero of Jn\u2032 (r). The most unstable modes are n = 0 and\nn = 1 corresponding to 1 and 3 line defects, respectively (see\nFig. 3). However, J1/2 (k0,0 r) has a divergent derivative that\nis incompatible with the physical requirement that the voltage, and hence the APD, must vary smoothly on a scale \u03be. On\nthe other hand, J3/2 (k1,0 r) smoothly vanishes at the origin.\nTherefore, in this case, the boundary condition at the origin\nselects a 3-line-defect pattern as observed in Fig. 1 (b). Interestingly, a 3-line-defect pattern is also selected with meander\npresent [Fig. 1 (f)], thereby suggesting that the boundary condition on a on the outer scale of the line-defect pattern is not\nstrongly affected by meander.\nThe analysis also predicts qualitative features of the radial\ndistribution of alternans amplitude for three- and one-linedefect patterns of Figs. 1(b) and 1(d), respectively. Fig. 4\n\nFIG. 4: hairms versus radial distance r for the pinwheel spiral (thin\nsolid line, red online) and anchored spiral (thick solid line, blue online), and respective theoretical radial modes R1,0 (r) (thin dashed,\nred online), and R0,0 (r) (dotted-dashed line, blue online).\n\ncompares the numerical radial distributions of root-meansquare amplitude hairms averaged over a full line-defect rotation period for three line-defects (thin solid line) and one linedefect (thick line), with the corresponding radial modes from\nthe theoretical analysis (dashed lines) scaled to have the same\nradial average as the observed curves. The theory predicts\nwell that the alternans amplitude is more strongly suppressed\nnear the core for the larger number of line defects.\nSo far our analysis has assumed that the wave speed is constant, which predicts that line-defects extend straight out of\nthe core and are stationary, as implied by the angular distribution sin ((n + 1/2)\u03b8) of linearly unstable modes (see Fig. 3).\nIn contrast, simulations in Fig. 1 show that line-defects have a\nspiral shape and slowly rotate inward in the opposite direction\nof the spiral wavefront. Line-defect motion can generally be\ninduced both by line-defect curvature and the dependence of\nthe wave speed c on the interval I between two waves, known\nas the conduction velocity (CV) restitution curve in the cardiac literature. While a full stability analysis that includes\nthese effects would be required to treat line-defect motion in\ngeneral, two important limiting cases can be readily analyzed.\nThe first pertains to anchored spiral waves for medium parameters where plane waves paced at the spiral rotation period\nexhibits stationary line-defects, as for the model of Ref. [15]\nstudied here. In this case, we expect line-defect motion to\nbe generated predominantly by the spiral wavefront dynamics\naround the anchoring obstacle. Neglecting wavefront curvature effects, this dynamics should be approximately described\nby that of a propagating pulse in a one-dimensional ring of\nperimeter L = 2\u03c0ri [17, 22]. To test this hypothesis, we\ncomputed the quasiperiodic frequency \u03a9 of the local medium\ndynamics induced by line-defect rotation for anchored spirals\nfor the model of Ref. [15]. The frequency was obtained\nby fitting the time series a(r, jT )/a(r, 0) at a single point\nr to \u03b7 j cos(\u03a9T j + \u03b4), with \u03b7, \u03a9, and \u03b4 the fitting parameters. For the theory, we used the dispersion relation giving the\nquasiperiodic frequency \u03a9 modulating alternans, a \u221d ei\u03a9jT ,\nin a one dimensional ring derived in Ref. [17]\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\ni\ni\u03a9T\n1\u2212\n= (1 \u2212 iwk \u2212 \u03be 2 k 2 )f \u2032 (I) +\ne\n, (4)\n2\u039bk\n2\u039bk\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: Comparison of numerical (circles, red online) and theoretical\n(solid line) line-defect rotation frequencies for spiral waves anchored\nto disks of varying radii for the model of Ref. [15].\n\nwhere k = \u03c0/L + \u03a9T /L is the wavenumber corresponding\nto a single line defect and \u039b = c\u2032 (I)/(2c2 ). The APD- and\nCV-restitution curves, f (I) and c(I), were calculated in a onedimensional cable as in Ref. [17]. In addition, the intercellular\ncoupling parameters \u03c9 and \u03be were estimated as \u03c9 \u223c 2\u03b3/c\nand \u03be \u223c (\u03b3D)1/2 [17]. The comparison in Fig. 5 shows that\nthe ring-based theory predicts reasonably well the frequency\nof line-defect rotation for anchored spiral waves of different\nperiod T , which was varied here by increasing the obstacle\nradius ri in the simulations.\nThe opposite limit that can also be readily understood is\nthe one where plane waves paced at the spiral rotation period\nexhibit line-defects that move towards the pacing site, which\ngenerally occurs for steeper CV-restitution. In this case, linedefect motion is expected to be dominated by the far-field spiral dynamics [17]. We have checked that, for the two-variable\nmodel of Ref. [17], spiral line-defects indeed rotate inward\nwith a frequency equal to the product of the velocity of the\nplanar line-defects and the inverse of their spacing. This property was purposely checked in a domain much larger than the\nspiral wavelength (re = 18 cm) and with an obstacle size\n(ri = 0.72 cm) sufficient to prevent spiral wave breakup inherent in this model. However, we expect this behavior to be\ngeneric for systems with traveling planar line-defects and to\nalso apply to freely rotating spirals with three line defects for\nparameters where breakup does not occur.\nIn summary, we have surveyed spiral line-defect patterns\nin simplified models of cardiac excitation with period-2 dynamics. Although far from exhaustive, this survey yields the\nstriking finding that freely propagating and anchored spiral\nwaves select different numbers of line-defects. This opens up\nthe possibility to distinguish free and anchored spiral waves\nin cardiac tissue by monitoring the number of line-defects.\nWe have shown that spiral wave unstable modes with different numbers of line-defects correspond to topologically quantized solutions of a Helmholtz equation. In this framework,\nthe boundary condition on the period-2 oscillation amplitude\nin the spiral core, which is fundamentally different for free\n\nand anchored spirals, is responsible for selecting the number of line defects. Furthermore, we have found that spiral\nline-defect inward rotation can be driven either by the core\nor far-field wavefront dynamics, with concomitantly different frequencies. Our results suggest that the observation of\nsingle-line-defect spirals in cardiac tissue culture [5, 6] may\nbe a consequence of anchoring on small millimeter-size heterogeneities. However, the dynamics in real tissue is also influenced by the coupling of voltage and intracellular calcium\ndynamics [1, 4], which has been neglected here. The investigation of the effect of this coupling on line-defect dynamics\nand its relationship to wave breakup is an interesting future\nproject. Finally, the previous finding of free spirals with one\nline-defect [21] in period-2 media with qualitatively different\nexcitable dynamics than cardiac tissue suggests that other pattern selection mechanisms may be operative in different media. These differences also remain to be elucidated.\nWe thank Blas Echebarria for valuable discussions. This\nwork was supported by NIH Grant No. P01 HL078931.\n\n[1] J. N.
