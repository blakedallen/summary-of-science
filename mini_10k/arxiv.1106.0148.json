We show that anisotropy energy barriers can be determined from\nergodicity breaking energies of the corresponding isolated system, independently of the mechanism\nof magnetic decay (coherent rotation or nucleation). In particular, we show that, in presence of\nlong range interaction the anisotropy energy barrier grows as the particle volume, V , for sufficiently\nlarge volume, and it can grow, for finite sized systems, as V 2\u2212\u03b1/d , where \u03b1 \u2264 d is the range of\ninteraction and d is the embedding dimension. As a consequence there is a relevant enhancement\nof the anisotropy energy barrier compared with the short range case, where the anisotropy energy\nbarrier grows at most as the particle cross sectional area for large or elongated particles.\nPACS numbers: 05.20.-y,05.10.-a, 75.10.Hk, 75.60.Jk\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA truly comprehensive understanding of magnetism at\nthe nanoscale is still lacking. From a theoretical point of\nview the problem of magnetization decay in nanosystems\nis difficult to treat: nanoscopic systems are too big to\nbe solved by brute force calculation and too small to\nbe tackled by the tools of statistical mechanics at the\nequilibrium. Indeed, the problem of magnetization decay\nis a typical example of out of equilibrium phenomenon,\nwhich is the decay out of a metastable state.\nOn the other hand, nanomagnetism has also important consequences in the technology of memory and information processing devices. The quest for improving magneto-storage density calls for the realization of\nsmaller and smaller magnetic units. Significant improvements in experimental techniques allowed investigations\nof magnetic properties in nanoparticles and nanowires[1].\nIn particular, recently, there has been great interest in\nSingle Chain Magnets (SCM) [2\u20136], which are possible\ncandidates for nanoscopic memory units. Nanoscopic\nsystems can also show ferromagnetic behavior at low but\nfinite temperature, even if a ferromagnetic phase transition is theoretically forbidden [7], due to large magnetic\ndecay times.\nThe modelization of the magnetization decay, through\nan on\u2013site anisotropic barrier is quite typical in literature, even if, mainly short-range interactions have been\nconsidered. Nevertheless, in many realistic situations,\none needs to go beyond nearest neighbor coupling, taking into account the long range nature of the interaction\ndefined by a two\u2013body spin interaction constant decaying at large distance with a power law exponent \u03b1 not\nlarger than the embedding spatial dimension d[8]. It is\nthe case, for instance, of the dipolar interaction in 3\u2013d\nsystems, or of the so\u2013called RKKY (Ruderman-KittelKasuya-Yosida) interaction, which decays as r\u2212d , where\n\nr is the distance between spins, and d is the dimension of\nthe lattice system. In particular, the latter might be responsible for the ferromagnetic behavior of Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors (DMS) [9] and Diluted Magnetic\nOxides (DMO) [10], promising materials for the realization of spintronics devices.\nOne of the first attempts to understand magnetic decay times in nanoparticles is due to Ne\u00e9l[11] and Brown\n[12], who considered that all the spins in a magnetic particle move coherently, so that they can be considered as\na single spin and described magnetization decay as due\nto thermal activation over a single energy barrier. In\nBrown's theory this time, \u03c4 , is shown to follow an Arrhenius Law :\n\u03c4 \u221d e\u03b2\u2206E\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T is the inverse temperature and \u2206E \u221d\nV is the anisotropic energy barrier proportional to the\nparticle volume V . A step forward Brown's theory has\nbeen realized by Braun [13]. In his theoretical approach\na sufficiently elongated system of short range interacting spins with an on\u2013site anisotropy barrier, have been\nshown to reverse their magnetic moments (thus producing an average magnetization decay) through a process\ncalled nucleation, energetically convenient with respect\nto coherent rotation. In this mechanism, accomplished\nby the formation of a soliton-antisoliton domain wall,\nthe magnetic anisotropic energy to be overcome turns\nout to be proportional to the cross sectional area of the\nparticle, \u2206E \u221d A and not to its volume V . Studies\nof different mechanisms of magnetic decay have been the\nobjective of intense investigation[14] until recently, where\nalso 3\u2013d spherical samples with short range interactions\nand on\u2013site anisotropy are shown to produce nucleation\nfor sufficiently large radius[15]. Thus, for short range interaction, Brown's theory, and a consequent Arrhenius\nLaw with an exponent proportional to the volume V of\n\n\f2\nthe particle is valid only for very small particles, while in\ngeneral, for large or elongated particles, the exponent is\ngiven by the cross sectional area of the particle. A smaller\nexponent means smaller decay times for the same temperature. The size and shape dependence of the magnetic\nanisotropy barrier, and consequently of the decay times,\nhave been also confirmed experimentally in Ref. [16].\nThe consequences of long range interaction on magnetic decay is much less investigated. Long range interaction can affect the decay out of a metastable state\nin a significant way; in the seminal paper [17] it was\nshown that the decay time out of a metastable state in\na toy model with infinite range interaction is given by\nthe Arrhenius Law with an exponent proportional to the\nsquared volume of the particle.\nThe main goal of this paper is to analyze magnetic\ndecay beyond nearest-neighbor interaction, focusing on\nrealistic long range interacting systems. In order to estimate the dependence of magnetic decay times on temperature, we propose a different point of view, which turns\nout to be independent of the decay mechanism and related to the recently found Topological Non-connectivity\nThreshold (TNT) in anisotropic spin systems [18, 19].\n\nII. TOPOLOGICAL NON-CONNECTIVITY\nTHRESHOLD AND MAGNETIZATION DECAY\nTIME\n\nIn this Section, following Ref. [18], we briefly review\nthe Topological Non-Connectivity Threshold.\nLet us consider a generic anisotropic spin system, with\nan easy axis of magnetization, (the direction n\u0302easy of the\nmagnetization in the ground state), with a microcanonical energy\n~1 , . . . , S\n~N ) = E.\nH(S\nLet us also set\nm = (1/N )\n\nX\n\n~k * n\u0302easy ,\nS\n\n(2)\n\nportion determined by the TNT, remains finite, when the\nnumber of particles becomes infinite.\nWhile for isolated systems, the magnetization cannot\nreverse its sign if its microcanonical energy E is below the\nenergy threshold Etnt , when the system is put in contact\nwith a heat bath this may happen for any (even extremely\nlow) temperature. Question arise whether the TNT dictates in some way the magnetization decay. This is exactly what we have found (see Sections below), namely\n\u2206Etnt = Etnt \u2212 Emin , represents an effective energy barrier for magnetic decay and the decay time depends exponentially on such energy barrier:\n\u03c4 = \u03c40 e\u03b2(Etnt \u2212Emin ) = \u03c40 e\u03b2\u2206Etnt ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere, \u03c40 is a factor, that may depend on temperature\ntoo, Emin is the ground state energy and \u03b2 = 1/kB T .\nWhile this was confirmed in simple toy models with allto-all interaction among the spins [21], here our aim is to\ngeneralize these results to realistic spin systems.\nIt is possible to give a heuristic justification of Eq. (4).\nMagnetic decay occurs through fluctuations of the magnetization around its equilibrium value. The probability\na magnetization fluctuation is determined by the free energy barrier, \u2206F = \u2206E \u2212kB T \u2206S, through the Arrhenius\nfactor, e\u2212\u03b2\u2206F . Since the entropic barrier, \u2206S, is usually\nnegligible at low temperature, the accessible spin configurations can be determined minimizing the energy only.\nIn order to reverse its sign, the value of the magnetization\nhas to go, say, from a magnetization m = 1 to m = 0.\nSince for m = 1 the system is in its minimal energy, it is\nclear that \u2206Etnt represents the minimal energy barrier\nfound by the system while reversing its magnetization.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MODEL : ISOTROPIC \u03b1\u2212RANGED\nPLUS ON\u2013SITE INTERACTION\n\nLet us now focus on spin systems with isotropic long\u2013\nrange exchange interaction and on\u2013site anisotropy, described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nk\n\nas the magnetization along the easy axis. Note that in\nour paper it will be n\u0302easy = \u1e91.\nIt was proven [18] that below a suitable threshold, Etnt ,\ngiven by the minimal energy attainable under the constraint of zero magnetization m along the easy axis:\n~i ...) | m = 0),\nEtnt = Min(H(...S\n\n(3)\n\nthe constant energy surface is disconnected in two portions, characterized by a different sign of the magnetization. From the dynamical point of view one has a case\nof ergodicity breaking: a trajectory at fixed energy cannot change the sign of magnetization since it is confined\nforever in one region of the phase space.\nIt was also demonstrated that in case of long range\ninteraction among the spins[20], the disconnected energy\n\nH = \u2212J\n\nXS\n~i S\n~j\ni>j\n\n\u03b1\nri,j\n\n\u2212D\n\nX\n\n(Siz )2 ,\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\nwhere, S~i are the spin vectors with unit length, \u03b1 determines the range of the interaction among the spins,\nJ > 0 is the exchange coupling and D > 0 is the on\u2013site\nenergy anisotropy. The minimal energy for this class of\nspin systems is attained when all the spins are alligned\nalong the \u1e91 direction, which thus defines the easy axis of\nthe magnetization.\nIn the following we will mainly focus on the \"critical\"\ncase \u03b1 = d, since it is relevant for realistic applications\n(dipole interaction in 3-D and RKKY interactions); here\ncritical is referred to the fact that interaction is defined\nas long\u2013ranged for \u03b1 < d, while it is short ranged for\n\u03b1 > d [8]. Moreover, we choose Hamiltonian (5) for sake\n\n\f3\n\n\u2022 the first one with all spins aligned perpendicular to\nthe easy axis. The energy difference of this configuration from the one having minimal energy is DN ,\nwhich is the energy barrier due to the coherent rotation of all spins;\n\u2022 a configuration, labelled \u2191\u2193, consisting ot two\nneighbors identical blocks with opposite magnetization along the easy axis. This configuration roughly\ncorresponds to what is called nucleation configuration in literature. The energy difference of this\nconfiguration from the minimal energy in the case\n\u03b1 \u2264 d, is given by [20]:\n\u2206E\u2191\u2193 = JC\u03b1,d N 2\u2212\u03b1/d ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere C\u03b1,d is a suitable constant, for instance,\nC1,1 ' 4 ln 2.\nFollowing similar reasoning as in Ref. [20], it can be\nshown that the energy of these two configurations is a\ngood approximation of Etnt , so that we can write\n\u2206Etnt \u2261 Etnt \u2212 Emin \u2248 Min(DN, \u2206E\u2191\u2193 ),\n\n(7)\n\nNote that Eq. (7), valid whenever DN is not close to\n\u2206E\u2191\u2193 , gives an estimation of the anisotropic energy barrier, which can be used in Eq. (4) to get magnetic decay\ntimes. Eq. (7) has been confirmed numerically in Fig. (1),\nfor the case \u03b1 = d = 1, and we have found coherent rotation for D \u001c Dcr = 4J ln 2 and nucleation for D \u001d Dcr ,\nwhere the Dcr has been obtained comparing Eqs. (6) and\n(7) [26]. In this figure we compute numerically the energy\nbarrier \u2206Etnt using a minimizing constrained algorithm\n(symbols) and we compare it with the approximation (7)\nfor one dimensional chains with different number of spins.\nAs one can see, the agreement is fairly good. Note that\nin case of nucleation (DN > \u2206E\u2191\u2193 ), the effective energy\nbarrier \u2206Etnt to be put in the Arrhenius Law should be\nincreased by a term D, called single-spin flip. This extra\nterm should be added only for continuous models, as the\nmodified Heisenberg model we are considering, so that,\n\u03c40 \u221d eD\u03b2 [3]. This should be done since a single spin can\ncontinuously change from S = 1 to S = \u22121 only passing the state S = 0. While the two extreme states have\nthe same magnetic anisotropy (since it is proportional to\nDS 2 ) the intermediate state S = 0 has a barrier higher\nby a factor D. This additional spin-flip does not occur,\nfor instance, in the Ising\u2013like models, since there are no\nintermediate states between S = 1 and S = \u22121.\nIn the following we analyzed the magnetic decay time\nin the canonical ensemble, using a modified Monte Carlo\n\n300\nN=10\nN=20\nN=40\nN=100\n\n200\n\n1D NU\n\n1D CR\n\n\u2206Etnt\n\nof generality since we would like to consider not a single\nspecific interaction, but a class of interactions depending\nas some power of distance among spins.\nFor this class of systems, the energy Etnt , see Eq. (3),\ncan be computed numerically using a minimizing constrained algorithm. We can also estimate analytically\nEtnt for a generic range of the interaction \u03b1. To this\npurpose let us consider two configurations with m = 0:\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nD\nFIG. 1: Energy barrier as a function of the anisotropy barrier\nD for the \u03b1 = d = 1.

As initial condition we choose all\nspins aligned along the easy axis, and from the exponential decay of the average magnetization, hm(t)i \u221d e\u2212t/\u03c4 ,\nwe computed the magnetic decay time, \u03c4 .\n\nIV.\n\nENHANCED BARRIER\n\nIn this Section, we show our numerical results for the\nmagnetization decay. They will clearly give evidence of\nthe enhancement of the magnetization decay time due to\nlong range interaction.\n\nA.\n\nOne dimensional case\n\nHere we focus on the one dimensional critical case.\nOur results for the magnetic decay time, are collected in\nFig. 2, where we consider the case \u03b1 = d = 1: magnetic\ndecay times are shown in the upper panel for coherent rotation (D \u001c Dcr ) and in the lower panel for nucleation\n(D \u001d Dcr ). Samples with different number of particles\nexperience different anisotropy energy barriers. As one\ncan see the numerical results indicated by symbols well\nagree with the theoretical prediction given by Eq. (7),\nshown as full lines. Our results for coherent rotation,\nFig. 2 (upper panel), clearly indicates that Brown's theory of coherent rotation with an anisotropy energy barrier\nproportional to the particle volume (V \u221d N ) is still at\nwork even for long range interacting systems. In Fig. 2\n(lower panel), the case of nucleation is shown. Also in\nthis case the anisotropy energy barrier is proportional to\n\n\f4\n8\n\n10\n\n1D CR\n\n6\n\n\u03c4\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nN=20\nN=40\nN=100\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n\u03b2/\u03b2stat\nN=20\nN=40\nN=100\nN=200\n\n8\n\n10\n\n6\n\n\u03c4\n\n10\n\n4\n\ngrow even faster than the volume.\nFrom Eqs (6) and (7), we have that while for coherent\nrotation, the anisotropy energy is always proportional to\nthe volume of the particle, for nucleation the anisotropy\nenergy can grow even faster than the volume of the particle, \u2206E\u2191\u2193 \u221d N 2\u2212\u03b1/d . Since the anisotropy energy barrier\nis determined by the smallest of the two barriers, it follows that for sufficiently large particles the energy barrier\nwill always be proportional to the particle volume since\nV \u221d N . In particular, this means that even in the case\nof 3\u2013d elongated particles, differently with what happens\nin the short range case, the energy barrier does not depend on the cross sectional area but on the whole particle\nvolume.\nThis theoretical prediction has been numerically confirmed in Fig. 3, where we study the case of nucleation in\nthin parallelepipeds L\u00d7L\u00d7\u000fL, in presence of a \" critical\"\ninteraction \u03b1 = d = 3.

Specifically\nfor coherent rotation, we have \u2206Etnt = DN , while for nucleation, we have \u2206Etnt = \u2206E\u2191\u2193 +D (see text for explanations).\nVertical dashed lines refer to the inverse rescaled statistical\ntemperature \u03b2 = \u03b2stat obtained by a standard mean field\napproach.\n\nthe particle volume. Let us remark that this behaviour\nis different for short range interacting systems, where in\nthe one dimensional case, the anisotropic energy barrier\nis independent from the size of the system [3, 6]. Note\nthat for high temperature (small \u03b2 values) symbols with\ndifferent number of spins lye upon the same curve, that\nturns out to be almost independent of N .\n\nB.\n\nMultidimensional case\n\nOur results can be extended to higher dimensions. In\nparticular we will show that for large enough particle, the\nanisotropic energy barrier is always proportional to the\nvolume of the particle. Moreover we point out that for\nfinite sized systems, the anisotropic energy barrier can\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\nL\nFIG. 3: Energy barrier \u2206E as a function of the side L of the\nparallelepiped, obtained by an exponential fitting of the decay\ntime vs the inverse temperature \u03b2. Here is \u03b1 = 3, J = 1/20\nand D = 0.5 (nucleation).\n\nThe energy barrier \u2206E extracted from the numerical\nfit of the Arrhenius Law \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(\u03b2\u2206E) has been plot\nas a function of the side L of the parallelepiped. For sake\nof comparison the lines proportional to the cross section\n(L2 ) and to the volume (L3 ) has been drawn. As one can\nsee without any doubt the barrier grows as the volume.\nFrom Eqs (6) and (7), it also follows that, when \u03b1 < d\nthe anisotropy barrier can grow even faster than the volume of the particle. This can happen up to a critical\nvalue of the particle volume, for which DN = \u2206E\u2191\u2193 .\nSuch an effect is a distinguished feature of long\u2013range interaction and it is forbidden in the case of short range interactions. To confirme such theoretical prediction let us\nconsider a square lattice (d = 2) characterized by an exchange interaction decaying as 1/r (\u03b1 = 1). Even in this\ncase we can distinguish between the regime of coherent\nrotation (large anisotropy barriers D) from that of nucleation (small D values).

To prove that we\nfirst consider in Fig. 5 two different situations taken from\nthe upper (coherent rotation) and the lower panel (nucleation) of Fig. 4. In particular we consider one single\nMontecarlo trajectory and we plot, in Fig. 5 the value of\nPN ~\nPN\n1\nz\nM = | N1 i=1 S\ni | and m = N\ni=1 Si , as a function of\nthe Metropolis time. It is clear that while in the case of\ncoherent rotation (upper panel of Fig. 5) M \u2248 1 and m\nchange its sign, for nucleation (lower panel of Fig. 5) one\nhas M ' |m|.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n1\n\n\u03b2/\u03b2stat\n\n2D CR\n\nAs one can see the agreement with the theory, which\npredicts an energy barrier \u2206Etnt \u221d JN 3/2 is fairly good.\nFor sake of comparison, the regime of coherent rotation\n(Fig. 4, upper panel) is also shown, indicating that, in\nthis case, the energy barrier is proportional to the volume of the particle, namely \u2206Etnt \u221d DN .\nAnother important point to be discussed is in which\ntemperature range the Arrhenius Law with the exponent\ngiven by Eq. (7) holds. In the cases of coherent rotation\nand nucleation, see also Ref. [12], we might expect that\nthe Arrhenius Law is valid only when kB T \u001c \u2206Etnt .\nClearly this gives an upper bound for the temperature for\nwhich Eq. (4) is valid. Moreover it should be T \u001c Tstat ,\nwhere the latter is the temperature at which the barrier\nat m = 0 in the free energy vanishes (and it coincides\nwith the temperature at which a phase transition occurs\nin the thermodynamic limit). It is very interesting that,\ncomputing Tstat = 1/kB \u03b2stat by means of a standard\nmean field approach, one gets a very nice estimate of the\nvalidity range of the Arrhenius Law (see dashed vertical\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n\n0\n\n50000\n\n100000\n\nt\n1\n\n2D NU\n\n0.5\n\nm, M\n\nFIG. 4: Decay time \u03c4 vs the rescaled inverse temperature\n\u03b2/\u03b2stat for a square lattice (d = 2) with \u03b1 = 1. for J = 1 and\nD = 0.025 (upper panel, coherent rotation); and for J = 1/40\nand D = 1/2 (lower panel, nucleation).

In both panels the red curve refers to M ,\nwhile the black one to m.\n\nAs an interesting consequences of the coherent motion\nof the spins during the magnetic reversal, we show here,\nfocusing on the one dimensional case, that one can estimate the whole probability distribution of the magnetization in the canonical ensemble, PT (m) at low temperature and around m = 0.\nNote that the knowledge of the probability distribution\nof the magnetization allows one to compute the magnetic\n\n\f6\n\n\u03c4 \u221d e\u03b2\u2206F =\n\nPT (mmax )\n,\nPT (mmin )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere PT (mmax,min ) stands for the maximum/minimum\nvalue of the probability distribution.\nDue to the coherent motion of all spins it is possible to\nexpress the energy of the system as a function of the total\nmagnetization along the easy axis; from the knowledge\nof E(m) we can compute PT (m) since:\nPT (m) dm = PT (E) dE = e\u2212E(m)/kB T \u03c1(E) dE\nwhere \u03c1(E) is the density of states at fixed energy. Using the fact that \u03c1(E)dE = \u03c1(m)dm, where \u03c1(m) is the\ndensity of states at fixed magnetization, we have:\nPT (m) dm = e\u2212E(m)/kB T \u03c1(m) dm.\n\n(9)\n\nTaking into account that m = (2k \u2212 N )/N is the magnetization of a system composed by k spins along the easy\naxis and N \u2212 k opposite to it, one gets,\nE(m) = 2Emin (N+ ) + 2Emin (N\u2212 ) \u2212 Emin (N ),\n\n0\n\n1D CR\n\n10\n\nLet us compute E(m) for coherent rotation and nucleation. When the decay of the magnetization oc~i S\n~j = 1, and\ncurs through coherent rotation we have S\nSiz = hS z i = m so that, from Eq.

(11) gives an excellent approximation of the probability distribution of the\nmagnetization around m = 0 in the coherent rotation\nregime, see Fig. 6 (upper panel).\nIn case of nucleation the possible configurations which\nthe system can visit can be obtained assuming that magnetic decay occurs by first reversing one of the edge spins,\nthen its nearest neighbor, and then the spin immediately\nafter until all spins are reversed. If we have k spins on\nthe left pointing upwards and N \u2212k spins pointing downwards, we can write the energy of this configuration as\nE(k, N ) = Emin (k) + Emin (N \u2212 k) + W (k, N \u2212 k), (12)\nwhere W (k, N \u2212 k) is the interaction energy between the\ntwo neighbors blocks of k and N \u2212 k spins and\nEmin (k) = \u2212J/2\n\nk X\nk\nX\n\n\u03b1\n1/ri,j\n\u2212 Dk,\n\nPT(m)\n\n0\n\nm\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1D NU\n\n10\nSince all spins move coherently on a sphere, the density of states at fixed magnetization along any axis is\nconstant, \u03c1(m) = const. Moreover the first term in the\nr.h.s. of Eq. (10) is independent of m and we have (for\ncoherent rotations):\n\n(15)\n\nwhere N\u00b1 = N (1 \u2212 m)/2. In this case it is more difficult\nto estimate \u03c1(m). Assuming, also in this case \u03c1(m) =\nconst., from the knowledge of E(m) (Eq. (15)), we obtain\nPT (m) \u221d e\u2212\u03b2E(m) which agrees very well (apart close to\nm = \u00b11) with numerical results in the nucleation regime,\nsee Fig. 6 (lower panel).\n\nPT(m)\n\ndecay time:\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nm\n\nFIG. 6: Probability distribution of the magnetization PT (m)\nvs the magnetization m for \u03b1 = d = 1, N = 20 and different temperatures \u03b2 = 1/kB T .

The\nbarrier, which determines magnetic decay times, can be\ncomputed from the topological non-connectivity energy\n\n\f7\nthreshold in the corresponding isolated systems. Our\nanalysis shows that for long range interaction two different regimes can be identifyied, coherent rotation and\nnucleation. In the first regime we have predicted and numerically confirmed that magnetic decay time depends\nexponentially on the volume of the particle. Nevertheless, in the regime of nucleation, the magnetic barrier depends on a suitable power of the volume, V 2\u2212\u03b1/d , where\n\u03b1 < d is the range of interaction and d is the lattice dimension. These facts have two remarkable consequences.\nThe first one is that magnetic decay times depend exponentially on the volume of the particle and not on its\ncross sectional area, as happens for short range interactions. The second one is that, the fast growth of the\n\nmagnetic barrier with the volume, gives rise to the possibility to observe long-lived metastable ferromagnetism\nin finite systems at high temperature which is ruled out\nfor short range interaction.\n\n[1] W.
