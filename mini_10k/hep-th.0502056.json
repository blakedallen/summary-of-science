Applied to the nonlinear \u03c3 model, to lowest order the vanishing of\nthe \u03b2-function for the tachyon field generates an equation analogous to that\nfound in open string field theory. Although the nonlinear term depends on the\ncut-off function, this arbitrariness can be removed by a rescaling of the tachyon\nfield.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe calculations developed by Friedan and others [1, 2, 3] allow us to express world\nsheet scale invariance of \u03c3 models in terms of conditions satisfied by target space fields.\nThe resulting equations are perturbative in the number of loops computed in the world\nsheet field theory and are given as an expansion in powers of \u03b1\u2032 . For example, to lowest\norder the target space metric must satisfy Einstein's equations, while the tachyon field\nmust solve the Klein-Gordon equation with negative mass-squared. In this note we\napply the Wilsonian, or Exact RG (ERG) techniques invented by Wilson [4], Wegner\nand Houghton [5] and Polchinski [6], and developed by many others more recently\n(for example see [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14] and references therein) to the same model.\nEarlier applications of the ERG to \u03c3 models can be found in [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and\nreferences.\nThe advantage of these ERG techniques is that there is no reliance on a perturbation expansion, and the resulting conditions for scale invariance might be expected\nin some sense to go beyond the known perturbative results. The disadvantage is that\none always has to make some kind of approximation; the generic effective action will\ncontain all field operators compatible with the symmetry of the problem, and so some\nkind of truncation is necessary to even begin a calculation. In the next section we\nwill write the effective action as an expansion in world sheet derivatives, and curtail\nthis expansion at the lowest order. This is the local potential approximation. In\nterms of fields on the target space of the sigma model, we have a tachyon field propagating on fixed, flat geometry. Imposing scale invariance yields equations for the\ntachyon field, which we will compare to known results from open string field theory\n[20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\n\n2\n\nThe Local Potential Approximation and Tachyon\nField Equation\n\nWe regularise the theory and introduce a mass-scale \u039b by multiplying the propagator\n2\n(with momentum p) by a cut-off function, K( p\u039b ), which falls rapidly to zero for large\nvalues of the argument. The partition function is:\nZ =\n\nZ\n\nS[X; \u039b] =\n\nZ\n\nDXe\u2212S[X;\u039b]\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\u2212\u2202 2\nd2 \u03c3 \uf8ed\u2212 X i (\u03c3)K\n2\n\u039b2\n\n!\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2202 2 X i (\u03c3)\uf8f8 + Sint [X; \u039b]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere indices are lowered and raised using \u03b4ij and its inverse. When we change\nthe mass-scale \u039b the physics is required to remain the same, and in particular the\n1\n\n\fpartition function must satisfy\ndZ\n=0\n(2)\nd\u039b\nso that correlation functions and other physical quantities should not depend on what\nscale we impose the cut-off. The additional terms in the action needed to impose this\ncondition are contained in the effective interaction lagrangian, Sint . Any function\nof the fields compatible with the symmetries of the problem may be present, and\nso in order to make progress some kind of truncation is needed. We assume a local\nexpansion in powers of world sheet derivatives:\n\u039b\n\nSint [X; \u039b] =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nd2 \u03c3 \u039b2 T (X; \u039b) + Uij (X; \u039b)\u2202\u03b1 X i \u2202 \u03b1 X j + . . .\n\n(3)\n\nwith powers of \u039b inserted to make the coefficient functions dimensionless. Further,\nin the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) the world sheet momenta are assumed\nto be sufficiently small so that we can neglect the Uij and higher derivative terms in\nEquation 3.\nWriting the action in terms of Fourier-transformed world-sheet fields X\u0303(q), the\npartition function is:\nZ=\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\nD X\u0303 exp \uf8f0\n\n\uf8eb\n\nq2\n1\nd2 q \uf8ed\u2212 X\u0303 i (q)X\u0303 i (\u2212q)q 2 K\n2\n\u039b2\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f9\n!\u22121 \uf8f6\n\uf8f8 \u2212 Sint [X\u0303; \u039b]\uf8fb\n\n(4)\n\nWe define dimensionless world sheet momenta p = \u039bq , and from the definition of the\npartition function:\ndZ\n\u039b\n=\nd\u039b\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nD X\u0303\n\n!\n\n\u2202Sint \u2212S[X\u0303;\u039b]\ne\nd p \u2212X\u0303 (p)X\u0303 (\u2212p)p K(p ) K (p ) \u2212 \u039b\n\u2202\u039b\n2\n\nh\n\ni\n\ni\n\n4\n\n2 \u22122\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\ni\n\n(5)\n\nFollowing Polchinski [6], we now choose the following condition for Sint and demonstrate that it is sufficient to satisfy Equation 2:\nZ\n\u03b4 2 Sint\n\u03b4Sint \u03b4Sint\n\u2202Sint\n= \u2212 d2 pK \u2032 (p2 )\n\u2212\n\u039b\n\u2202\u039b\n\u03b4 X\u0303 i (p) \u03b4 X\u0303 i (\u2212p) \u03b4 X\u0303 i (p)\u03b4 X\u0303 i (\u2212p)\n\n!\n\n(6)\n\nUpon substitution of Equation 6 into Equation 5 we find:\nZ\n\nd2 p K \u2032 (p2 )\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4\nD X\u0303\n\u03b4 X\u0303 i (p)\n\n\"\"\n\n#\n\n#\n\n\u03b4\n2X\u0303 i (p)p2 K(p2 )\u22121 +\ne\u2212S[X\u0303;\u039b] = 0\ni\n\u03b4 X\u0303 (\u2212p)\n\n(7)\n\nup to an overall infinite constant which can be absorbed into the normalization of\nZ. Hence 2 is satisfied, as claimed. The identity above is essentially that used in [6],\nand is an application of Gauss' divergence theorem. (As pointed out in [6], this naive\nmanipulation is justified because there is a cut-off).\n2\n\n\fWe can now translate Equation 6 into conditions on the coefficient fields in Equation 3, and then impose scale invariance. Using the LPA, we retain only T (X) in\nEquation 3, and assume that it can be expanded as a power series in X. Treating X\nas effectively constant in \u03c3 (see e.g. [14]), the derivation is then fairly lengthy but\nunambiguous [13, 14]. We find that:\n\u2202T\n0=\u039b\n=\n\u2202\u039b\n\n\u22022T\n\u2202T \u2202T\n\u2212 2T\n\u2212I0\n+ K0\ni\ni\n\u2202X \u2202X\n\u2202X i \u2202X i\n#\n\n\"\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nK0 = \u2212K \u2032 (0)\n1 Z 2\n1\n1 Z\u221e\n1\n\u2032 2\nI0 = \u2212\ndu K \u2032 (u) =\nd\np\nK\n(p\n)\n=\n\u2212\n[K(0) \u2212 K(\u221e)] =\n(9)\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n4\u03c0 0\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n(For the case of a scalar field theory, when there are no indices, these equations\nreduce to those derived in e.g.[10, 14]). Finally, writing the kinetic term in the action\nin the usual way for a bosonic string, with the conventional factor of 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032[25, 26],\nEquation 8 becomes:\n1\n0 = \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u2202 2 T + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 K0 (\u2202i T )2 \u2212 2T\n2\n\n(10)\n\nIn a Lorentzian signature the linearized version of Equation 10 is just Klein-Gordon\nwith a negative mass-squared. The appearance of a quadratic term cannot be deduced\nperturbatively, but the equation satisfied by T in open string field theory [23, 24] is\nidentical in form. We note that this differs from an earlier result by Tseytlin [19],\nwhere the coefficient K0 was found to be explicitly dependent on the cut-off, \u039b. The\nremaining arbitrariness of our K0 is an inevitable consequence of the truncation of the\nderivative expansion. However, so long as it is non-zero the arbitrariness is physically\nirrelevant; the field can always be rescaled to produce any desired coefficient for the\nquadratic term.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nHaving derived a tachyon field equation using the Wilsonian RG, there remain some\nnotable unresolved questions. The critical issue is whether K0 is present in a more\ncomplete ERG calculation. Also, truncating the world sheet derivative expansion has\ntruncated the \u03b1\u2032 expansion. The latter is effectively an expansion in target space\nderivatives, and it would be useful to understand fully the relation to the world sheet\nderivative expansion. It would further be interesting to understand the nature of the\nconnection to the boundary SFT used to analyse open string tachyons [21, 23, 24,\n3\n\n\f31, 32], and to Tseytlin's \u03c3 model approach to effective actions [28, 29, 30]. It is\nlikely to be necessary for consistency to consider the higher orders in the derivative\nexpansion, where the massless and massive fields become dynamical and couple to\nthe tachyon. However, the privileged role of the flat metric in this approach may\nmean that a covariant derivation is not possible.\nAcknowledgements: Thanks to A.A. Tseytlin, J. Polchinski and T.
