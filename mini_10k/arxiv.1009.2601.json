P. Korovkin\nwho in 1953 discovered such a property for the functions 1, x and x2 in the space C([0, 1]) of all\ncontinuous functions on the real interval [0, 1] as well as for the functions 1, cos and sin in the space\nof all continuous 2\u03c0-periodic functions on the real line ([77-78]).\nAfter this discovery, several mathematicians have undertaken the program of extending Korovkin's theorems in many ways and to several settings, including function spaces, abstract Banach\nlattices, Banach algebras, Banach spaces and so on. Such developments delineated a theory which\nis nowadays referred to as Korovkin-type approximation theory.\nThis theory has fruitful connections with real analysis, functional analysis, harmonic analysis,\nmeasure theory and probability theory, summability theory and partial differential equations. But\nthe foremost applications are concerned with constructive approximation theory which uses it as a\nvaluable tool.\nEven today, the development of Korovkin-type approximation theory is far from complete,\nespecially for those parts of it that concern limit operators different from the identity operator (see\nProblems 5.3 and 5.4 and the subsequent remarks).\nA quite comprehensive picture of what has been achieved in this field until 1994 is documented\nin the monographs of Altomare and Campiti ([8], see in particular Appendix D), Donner ([46]),\nKeimel and Roth ([76]), Lorentz, v. Golitschek and Makovoz ([83]). More recent results can be\nfound, e.g., in [1], [9-15], [22], [47-52], [63], [71-74], [79], [114-116], [117] and the references therein.\nThe main aim of this survey paper is to give a detailed self-contained introduction to the field\nas well as a secure entry into a theory that provides useful tools for understanding and unifying\nseveral aspects pertaining, among others, to real and functional analysis and which leads to several\napplications in constructive approximation theory and numerical analysis.\nThis paper, however, not only presents a survey on Korovkin-type theorems but also contains\nseveral new results and applications. Moreover, the organization of the subject follows a simple\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n94\n\nand direct approach which quickly leads both to the main results of the theory and to some new\nones.\nIn Sections 3 and 4, we discuss the first and the second theorem of Korovkin. We obtain both\nof them from a simple unifying result which we state in the setting of metric spaces (see Theorem\n3.2).\nThis general result also implies the multidimensional extension of Korovkin's theorem due to\nVolkov ([118]) (see Theorem 4.1). Moreover, a slight extension of it into the framework of locally\ncompact metric spaces allows to extend the Korovkin's theorems to arbitrary real intervals or, more\ngenerally, to locally compact subsets of Rd , d \u2265 1.\nThroughout the two sections, we present some applications concerning several classical approximation processes ranging from Bernstein operators on the unit interval or on the canonical\nhypercube and the multidimensional simplex, to Kantorovich operators, from Fej\u00e9r operators to\nAbel-Poisson operators, from Sz\u00e1sz-Mirakjan operators to Gauss-Weierstrass operators.\nWe also prove that the first and the second theorems of Korovkin are actually equivalent to\nthe algebraic and the trigonometric version, respectively, of the classical Weierstrass approximation\ntheorem.\nStarting from Section 5, we enter into the heart of the theory by developing some of the main\nresults in the framework of the space C0 (X) of all real-valued continuous functions vanishing at\ninfinity on a locally compact space X and, in particular, in the space C(X) of all real-valued\ncontinuous functions on a compact space X.\nWe choose these continuous function spaces because they play a central role in the whole theory\nand are the most useful for applications. Moreover, by means of them it is also possible to easily\nobtain some Korovkin-type theorems in weighted continuous function spaces and in Lp -spaces,\n1 \u2264 p. These last aspects are treated at the end of Section 6 and in Section 8.\nWe point out that we discuss Korovkin-type theorems not only with respect to the identity\noperator but also with respect to a positive linear operator on C0 (X) opening the door to a variety\nof problems some of which are still unsolved.\nIn particular, in Section 10, we present some results concerning positive projections on C(X), X\ncompact, as well as their applications to the approximation of the solutions of Dirichlet problems\nand of other similar problems.\nIn Sections 6 and 7, we present several results and applications concerning Korovkin sets for\nthe identity operator. In particular, we show that, if M is a subset of C0 (X) that separates the\npoints of X and if f0 \u2208 C0 (X) is strictly positive, then {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 is a Korovkin set in\nC0 (X).\nThis result is very useful because it furnishes a simple way to construct Korovkin sets, but in\naddition, as we show in Section 9, it turns out that it is equivalent to the Stone generalization to\nC0 (X)-spaces of the Weierstrass theorem. This equivalence was already established in [8, Section\n4.4] (see also [12-13]) but here we furnish a different, direct and more transparent proof.\nWe also mention that, at the end of Sections 7 and 10, we present some applications concerning\nBernstein-Schnabl operators associated with a positive linear operator and, in particular, with\na positive projection. These operators are useful for the approximation of not just continuous\nfunctions but also - and this was the real reason for the increasing interest in them - positive\nsemigroups and hence the solutions of initial-boundary value evolution problems. These aspects\nare briefly sketched at the end of Section 10.\nFollowing the main aim of \"Surveys in Approximation Theory\", this paper is directed to the\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n95\n\ngraduate student level and beyond. However, some parts of it as well as some new methods\ndeveloped here could also be useful to expert readers.\nA knowledge of the basic definitions and results concerning locally compact Hausdorff spaces\nand continuous function spaces on them is required as well as some basic properties of positive\nlinear functionals on these function spaces (Radon measures). However, the reader who is not\ninterested in this level of generality may replace everywhere our locally compact spaces with the\nspace Rd , d \u2265 1, or with an open or a closed subset of it or with the intersection of an open subset\nand a closed subset of Rd . However, this restriction does not produce any simplification of the\nproofs or of the methods.\nFor the convenience of the reader and to make the exposition self-contained, we collect all these\nprerequisites in the Appendix. There, the reader can also find some new simple and direct proofs\nof the main properties of Radon measures which are required throughout the paper, so that no a\npriori knowledge of the theory of Radon measures is needed.\nThis paper contains introductory materials so that many aspects of the theory have been omitted. We refer, e.g., to [8, Appendix D] for further details about some of the main directions\ndeveloped during the last fifty years.\nFurthermore, in the applications shown throughout the paper, we treat only general constructive\naspects (convergence of the approximation processes) without any mention of quantitative aspects\n(estimates of the rate of convergence, direct and converse results and so on) nor to shape preserving\nproperties. For such matters, we refer, e.g., to [8], [26], [38], [41], [42], [44], [45], [64], [65], [81-82],\n[83], [92], [109].\nWe also refer to [19, Proposition 3.7], [67], [69] and [84] where other kinds of convergence\nresults for sequences of positive linear operators can be found. The results of these last papers do\nnot properly fall into the Korovkin-type approximation theory but they can be fruitfully used to\ndecide whether a given sequence of positive linear operators is strongly convergent (not necessarily\nto the identity operator).\nFinally we wish to express our gratitude to Mirella Cappelletti Montano, Vita Leonessa and\nIoan Ra\u015fa for the careful reading of the manuscript and for many fruitful suggestions. We are\nalso indebted to Carl de Boor, Allan Pinkus and Vilmos Totik for their interest in this work as\nwell as for their valuable advice and for correcting several inaccuracies. Finally we want to thank\nMrs. Voichita Baraian for her precious collaboration in preparing the manuscript in LaTeX for\nfinal processing.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries and notation\n\nIn this section, we assemble the main notation which will be used throughout the paper together\nwith some generalities.\nGiven a metric space (X, d), for every x0 \u2208 X and r > 0, we denote by B(x0 , r) and B \u2032 (x0 , r)\nthe open ball and the closed ball with center x0 and radius r, respectively, i.e.,\nB(x0 , r) := {x \u2208 X | d(x0 , x) < r}\n\n(2.1)\n\nB \u2032 (x0 , r) := {x \u2208 X | d(x0 , x) \u2264 r}.\n\n(2.2)\n\nand\nThe symbol\nF (X)\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n96\n\nstands for the linear space of all real-valued functions defined on X. If M is a subset of F (X), then\nby L(M ) we designate the linear subspace generated by M . We denote by\nB(X)\nthe linear subspace of all functions f : X \u2212\u2192 R that are bounded, endowed with the norm of\nuniform convergence (briefly, the sup-norm) defined by\nkf k\u221e := sup |f (x)| (f \u2208 B(X)),\n\n(2.3)\n\nx\u2208X\n\nwith respect to which it is a Banach space.\nThe symbols\nC(X)\n\nand Cb (X)\n\ndenote the linear subspaces of all continuous (resp. continuous and bounded) functions in F (X).\nFinally, we denote by\nU Cb (X)\nthe linear subspace of all uniformly continuous and bounded functions in F (X). Both Cb (X) and\nU Cb (X) are closed in B(X) and hence, endowed with the norm (2.3), they are Banach spaces.\nA linear subspace E of F (X) is said to be a lattice subspace if\n|f | \u2208 E\n\nfor every\n\nf \u2208 E.\n\n(2.4)\n\nFor instance, the spaces B(X), C(X), Cb (X) and U Cb (X) are lattice subspaces.\nNote that from (2.4), it follows that sup(f, g), inf(f, g) \u2208 E for every f, g \u2208 E where\nsup(f, g)(x) := sup(f (x), g(x))\n\n(x \u2208 X)\n\n(2.5)\n\ninf(f, g)(x) := inf(f (x), g(x))\n\n(x \u2208 X).\n\n(2.6)\n\nand\nThis follows at once by the elementary identities\nsup(f, g) =\n\nf + g + |f \u2212 g|\n2\n\nand\n\ninf(f, g) =\n\nf + g \u2212 |f \u2212 g|\n.\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nMore generally, if f1 , . . . , fn \u2208 E, n \u2265 3, then sup fi , inf fi \u2208 E.\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nWe say that a linear subspace E of F (X) is a subalgebra if\nf *g \u2208E\n\nfor every\n\nf, g \u2208 E\n\n(2.8)\n\nor, equivalently, if f 2 \u2208 E for every f \u2208 E. In this case, if f \u2208 E and n \u2265 1, then f n \u2208 E and hence\nfor every real polynomial Q(x) := \u03b11 x + \u03b12 x2 + * * * + \u03b1n xn (x \u2208 R) vanishing at 0, the function\nQ(f ) := \u03b11 f + \u03b12 f 2 + * * * + \u03b1n f n\n\n(2.9)\n\nbelongs to E as well.

P. Korovkin in 1953 ([77], see also [78]). However, in [35],\nH. Bohman showed a result like Theorem 3.1 by considering sequences of positive linear operators\non C([0, 1]) of the form\nX\nL(f )(x) =\nf (ai )\u03c6i (x) (0 \u2264 x \u2264 1),\ni\u2208I\n\nwhere (ai )i\u2208I is a finite family in [0, 1] and \u03c6i \u2208 C([0, 1]) (i \u2208 I). Finally, we point out that the\ngerm of the same theorem can be also traced back to a paper by T. Popoviciu ([95]).\nKorovkin's theorem 3.1 (often called Korovkin's first theorem) has many important applications in the study of positive approximation processes in C([0, 1]).\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n101\n\nOne of them is concerned with the Bernstein operators on C([0, 1]) which are defined by\nn\n\u0010 k \u0011\u0012n\u0013\nX\nf\nBn (f )(x) :=\nxk (1 \u2212 x)n\u2212k\nn k\n\n(3.5)\n\nk=0\n\n(n \u2265 1, f \u2208 C([0, 1]), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1). Each Bn (f ) is a polynomial of degree not greater than n. They\nwere introduced by S. N. Bernstein ([34]) to give the first constructive proof of the Weierstrass\napproximation theorem (algebraic version) ([119]).\nActually, we have that:\nTheorem 3.6. For every f \u2208 C([0, 1]),\nlim Bn (f ) = f\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nuniformly on\n\n[0, 1].\n\nProof. Each Bn is a positive linear operator on C([0, 1]). Moreover, it is easy to verify that for\nany n \u2265 1\nBn (1) = 1, Bn (e1 ) = e1\nand\n\n1\nn\u22121\ne2 + e1 .\nn\nn\nTherefore, the result follows from Theorem 3.1.\nBn (e2 ) =\n\n\u0003\n\nThe original proof of Bernstein's Theorem 3.6 is based on probabilistic considerations (namely,\non the weak law of large numbers). For a survey on Bernstein operators, we refer, e.g., to [82] (see\nalso [42] and [8]).\nNote that Theorem 3.6 furnishes a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem\n[119] which we state below. (For a survey on many other alternative proofs of Weierstrass' theorem,\nwe refer, e.g., to [93-94].)\nTheorem 3.7. For every f \u2208 C([0, 1]), there exists a sequence of algebraic polynomials that\nuniformly converges to f on [0, 1].\nUsing modern language, Theorem 3.7 can be restated as follows\n\"The subalgebra of all algebraic polynomials is dense in C([0, 1])\nwith respect to the uniform norm\".\nBy means of Theorem 3.6, we have seen that the Weierstrass approximation theorem can be obtained from Korovkin's theorem.\nIt seems to be not devoid of interest to point out that, from the Weierstrass theorem, it is possible\nto obtain a special version of Korovkin's theorem which involves only positive linear operators Ln ,\nn \u2265 1, such that Ln (C([0, 1])) \u2282 B([0, 1]) for every n \u2265 1. This special version will be referred to\nas the restricted version of Korovkin's theorem.\nTheorem 3.8. The restricted version of Korovkin's theorem and Weierstrass' Approximation Theorem are equivalent.\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n102\n\nProof. We have to furnish a proof of the restricted version of Korovkin's theorem based solely on\nthe Weierstrass Theorem.\nConsider a sequence of positive linear operators (Ln )n\u22651 from C([0, 1]) into B([0, 1]) such that\nlim Ln (g) = g uniformly on [0, 1] for every g \u2208 {1, e1 , e2 }. As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we\nn\u2192\u221e\nthen get\nlim Ln (d2x )(x) = 0\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nuniformly with respect to x \u2208 [0, 1].\nFor m \u2265 1 and x, y \u2208 [0, 1], we have\n|xm \u2212 y m | \u2264 m|y \u2212 x|\nand hence, recalling the function em (x) = xm\n\n(0 \u2264 x \u2264 1),\n\n|em \u2212 y m 1| \u2264 m|e1 \u2212 y1| (y \u2208 [0, 1]).\nAn application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (2.16) implies, for any n \u2265 1 and y \u2208 [0, 1],\n|Ln (em ) \u2212 y m Ln (1)| \u2264 mLn (|e1 \u2212 y1|)\n\u2264m\n\np\n\nLn (1)\n\np\n\nq\np\nLn ((e1 \u2212 y1)2 ) = m Ln (1) Ln (d2y ).\n\nTherefore, lim Ln (em ) = em uniformly on [0, 1] for any m \u2265 1 and hence lim Ln (P ) = P\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nuniformly on [0, 1] for every algebraic polynomial P on [0, 1].\nWe may now conclude the proof because, setting M := sup kLn k = sup kLn (1)k < +\u221e and\nn\u22651\n\nn\u22651\n\nfixing f \u2208 C([0, 1]) and \u03b5 > 0, there exists an algebraic polynomial P on [0, 1] such that kf \u2212P k \u2264 \u03b5,\nand an integer r \u2208 N such that kLn (P ) \u2212 P k \u2264 \u03b5 for every n \u2265 r, so that\nkLn (f ) \u2212 f k \u2264 kLn (f ) \u2212 Ln (P )k + kLn (P ) \u2212 P k + kP \u2212 f k\n\u2264 M kf \u2212 P k + kLn (P ) \u2212 P k + kP \u2212 f k \u2264 (M + 2)\u03b5.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor another proof of Korovkin's first theorem which involves Weierstrass theorem, see [117].\nIt is well-known that there are \"trigonometric\" versions of both Korovkin's theorem and Weierstrass' theorem (see Theorems 4.3 and 4.6). Also, these versions are equivalent (see Theorem 4.7).\nIn the sequel, we shall also prove that the generalizations of these two theorems to compact and to\nlocally compact settings are equivalent as well (see Theorem 9.4).\nWe proceed now to illustrate another application of Korovkin's theorem that concerns the\napproximation of functions in Lp ([0, 1]), 1 \u2264 p < +\u221e, by means of positive linear operators. Note\nthat Bernstein operators are not suitable to approximate Lebesgue integrable functions (see, for\ninstance, [82, Section 1.9]).\nThe space C([0, 1]) is dense in Lp ([0, 1]) with respect to the natural norm\n\u0010Z 1\n\u00111/p\nkf kp :=\n|f (t)|p dt\n(f \u2208 Lp ([0, 1]))\n(3.6)\n0\n\nand\n\nkf kp \u2264 kf k\u221e\n\nif\n\nf \u2208 C([0, 1]).\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n103\n\nTherefore, the subalgebra of all algebraic polynomials on [0, 1] is dense in Lp ([0, 1]).\nThe Kantorovich polynomials introduced by L. V. Kantorovich ([75]) furnish the first constructive proof of the above mentioned density result. They are defined by\nKn (f )(x) :=\n\nn h\nX\n\n(n + 1)\n\nk=0\n\nZ\n\nk+1\nn+1\nk\nn+1\n\nf (t) dt\n\ni\u0012n\u0013\nk\n\nxk (1 \u2212 x)n\u2212k\n\n(3.8)\n\nfor every n \u2265 1, f \u2208 Lp ([0, 1]), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Each Kn (f ) is a polynomial of degree not greater than\nn and every Kn is a positive linear operator from Lp ([0, 1]) (and, in particular, from C([0, 1]) into\nC([0, 1])). For additional information on these operators, see [8, Section 5.3.7], [82], [42, Chapter\n10].\nTheorem 3.9.

It furnishes the first constructive proof of the Weierstrass\napproximation theorem for periodic functions.\nTheorem 4.6. If f \u2208 Lp2\u03c0 (R), 1 \u2264 p < +\u221e (resp. f \u2208 C2\u03c0 (R)) then there exists a sequence of\ntrigonometric polynomials that converges to f in Lp2\u03c0 (R) (resp. uniformly on R).\nAs in the \"algebraic\" case, we shall now show that from Weierstrass' approximation theorem,\nit is possible to deduce a \"restricted\" version of Theorem 4.3, where in addition it is required that\neach operator Ln maps C2\u03c0 (R) into B(R). We shall also refer to this version as the restricted\nversion of Korovkin's second theorem.\nTheorem 4.7. The restricted version of Korovkin's second Theorem 4.3 and Weierstrass' Theorem\n4.6 are equivalent.\nProof. An inspection of the proof of Theorem 4.5 shows that Theorem 4.3 implies Theorem 4.5\nand, hence, Theorem 4.6.\nConversely, assume that Theorem 4.6 is true and consider a sequence (Ln )n\u22651 of positive linear\noperators from C2\u03c0 (R) into B(R) such that Ln (g) \u2212\u2192 g uniformly on R for every g \u2208 {1, cos, sin}.\nFor every m \u2265 1, set fm (x) := cos mx and gm (x) := sin mx (x \u2208 R). Since the subspace of all\ntrigonometric polynomials is dense in C2\u03c0 (R) and\nsup kLn k = sup kLn (1)k < +\u221e,\nn\u22651\n\nn\u22651\n\nit is enough to show that Ln (fm ) \u2192 fm and Ln (gm ) \u2192 gm uniformly on R for every m \u2265 1.\nGiven x \u2208 R, consider the function \u03a6x (y) = sin x\u2212y\n2 (y \u2208 R). Then\n\u03a62 (y) := sin2\n\n1\nx\u2212y\n= (1 \u2212 cos x cos y \u2212 sin x sin y) (y \u2208 R)\n2\n2\n\nand hence\nLn (\u03a6x )(x) \u2192 0 uniformly with respect to\n\nx \u2208 R.\n\nOn the other hand, for m \u2265 1 and x, y \u2208 R, we get\n\u0010x \u2212 y\u0011\n\u0010x \u2212 y\u0011\n\u0010x + y \u0011\nsin m\n\u2264 cm sin\n|fm (x) \u2212 fm (y)| = 2 sin m\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere cm := 2 sup\u03b1\u2208R\n\nsin m\u03b1\nsin \u03b1 ,\n\nand hence\n\n|fm (x)Ln (1) \u2212 Ln (fm )| \u2264 cm Ln (|\u03a6x |) \u2264 cm\n\np\n\np\nLn (1) Ln (\u03a62x ).\n\nTherefore, Ln (fm )(x) \u2212 fm (x) \u2192 0 uniformly with respect to x \u2208 R.\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n113\n\nA similar reasoning can be applied also to the functions gm , m \u2265 1, because\n\u0010x \u2212 y \u0011\n\u0010x \u2212 y \u0011\n\u0010x + y \u0011\nsin m\n\u2264 Km sin\n|gm (x) \u2212 gm (y)| = 2 cos m\n2\n2\n2\n\nand this completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor another short proof of Korovkin's second theorem that uses the trigonometric version of\nWeierstrass' theorem, see [117].\nFej\u00e9r's Theorem 4.5 is noteworthy because it reveals an important property of the Fourier series.\nActually, it shows that Fourier series are always Cesaro-summable to f in Lp2\u03c0 (R) or in C2\u03c0 (R),\nprovided that f \u2208 Lp2\u03c0 (R) or f \u2208 C2\u03c0 (R). Another deeper theorem, ascribed to Fej\u00e9r and Lebesgue,\nstates that, if f \u2208 L12\u03c0 (R), then its Fourier series is Cesaro-summable to f a.e. on R ([112, Theorem\n8.35]).\nBelow, we further discuss another regular summation method, namely the Abel-summation\nmethod, which applies to Fourier series.\nWe begin with the following equality\n\u221e\n\nX\n1+z\nzk\n=1+2\n1\u2212z\n\n(z \u2208 C, |z| < 1)\n\n(4.30)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich holds uniformly on any compact subset of {z \u2208 C | |z| < 1}. Given x \u2208 R and 0 \u2264 r < 1, by\napplying (4.30) to z = reix and by taking the real parts of both sides, we get\n1+2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nr k cos kx =\n\nk=1\n\n1 \u2212 r2\n1 \u2212 2r cos x + r 2\n\nand the identity holds uniformly when r ranges in a compact interval of [0, 1[.\nThe family of functions\n1 \u2212 r2\n(t \u2208 R)\nPr (t) :=\n1 \u2212 2r cos t + r 2\n(0 \u2264 r < 1) is called the Abel-Poisson kernel and the corresponding operators\nZ\n1 \u2212 r2 \u03c0\nf (t)\nPr (f )(x) :=\ndt (x \u2208 R)\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 1 \u2212 2r cos(x \u2212 t) + r\n\n(4.31)\n\n(4.32)\n\n(4.33)\n\n(0 \u2264 r < 1, f \u2208 L12\u03c0 (R)) are called the Abel-Poisson convolution operators. Taking (4.31)\ninto account, it is not difficult to show that\n\u221e\n\nX\n1\nr k (ak (f ) cos kx + bk (f ) sin kx)\nPr (f )(x) = a0 (f ) +\n2\n\n(4.34)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere the coefficients ak (f ) and bk (f ) are the Fourier coefficients of f defined by (4.18)\u2013(4.20).\nTheorem 4.8.

Altomare\n\n114\n\nProof. The kernels pr , 0 \u2264 r < 1, are positive. Moreover, from (4.34), we get\nPr (1) = 1, Pr (cos) = r cos, Pr (sin) = r sin\nand hence\n\n1\u2212r\n.\n2\nTherefore, the result follows from Theorem 4.4 (or from Theorem 4.5).\n\u03b2r =\n\n\u0003\n\nAccording to (4.34), Theorem 4.8 claims that the Fourier series of a function f \u2208 Lp2\u03c0 (R) (resp.\nf \u2208 C2\u03c0 (R)) is Abel summable to f in Lp2\u03c0 (R) (resp. uniformly on R).\nFor further applications of Korovkin's second theorem to approximation by convolution operators and summation processes, we refer, e.g., to [8, Section 5.4], [38], [41], [78].\nWe finally point out the relevance of Theorem 4.8 in the study of the Dirichlet problem for\nthe unit disk D := {(x, y) \u2208 R2 | x2 + y 2 \u2264 1}. Given F \u2208 C(\u2202D) = C(T) \u2261 C2\u03c0 (R), this problem\nconsists in finding a function U \u2208 C(D) possessing second partial derivatives on the interior of D\nsuch that\n\uf8f1 2\n2\n\uf8f2 \u2202 U (x, y) + \u2202 U (x, y) = 0 (x2 + y 2 < 1),\n(4.35)\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y 2\n\uf8f3\nU (x, y) = F (x, y)\n(x2 + y 2 = 1).\n\nBy using polar coordinates x = r cos \u03b8 and y = r sin \u03b8 (0 \u2264 r < 1, \u03b8 \u2208 R) and the functions\nf (\u03b8) := F (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) (\u03b8 \u2208 R) and u(r, \u03b8) := U (r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8) (0 \u2264 r < 1, \u03b8 \u2208 R), problem (4.35)\nturns into\n\uf8f1 2\n1 \u2202u\n1 \u22022u\n\u2202 u\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(r,\n\u03b8)\n+\n(r,\n\u03b8)\n+\n(r, \u03b8) = 0 0 < r < 1, \u03b8 \u2208 R,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nr\u03c0\u2202r\nr 2 \u2202\u03b8 2\n\uf8f2 \u2202r 2\nR\n1\n(4.36)\nu(0, \u03b8) = 2\u03c0\nf (t) dt\n\u03b8 \u2208 R,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 lim u(r, \u03b8) = f (\u03b8)\nuniformly w.r.t. \u03b8 \u2208 R.\nr\u21921\u2212\n\n.\n\nWith the help of Theorem 4.8 it is not difficult to show that a solution to problem (4.36) is\ngiven by\nu(r, \u03b8) = Pr (f )(\u03b8)\n(0 \u2264 r < 1, \u03b8 \u2208 R).\n(4.37)\nAccordingly, the function\nU (x, y) :=\n\n\u001a\n\nu(r, \u03b8) if x = r cos \u03b8, y = r sin \u03b8 and x2 + y 2 < 1,\nF (x, y) if x2 + y 2 = 1,\n\nis a solution to problem (4.35).

This theory has strong and fruitful connections not only\nwith classical approximation theory but also with real analysis, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, probability theory and partial differential equations. We refer to [8] for a rather detailed\ndescription of the development of this theory.\nWe shall next discuss some of the main results of the theory obtained in the framework of the\nspaces C0 (X) (X locally compact noncompact space), C(X) (X compact space), occasionally in\nLp (X, \u03bc\ne) spaces, 1 \u2264 p < +\u221e, and in weighted continuous function spaces. These spaces play a\ncentral role in the theory and they are the most useful in applications.\nIn addition, it transpires that the elementary methods used in the previous sections are not\nappropriate to give a wider possibility to determine other test functions (like {1, e1 , e2 } in C([0, 1])),\nlet alone to characterize them. To this aim, it seems to be unavoidable to use a more precise\nanalysis involving the point topology of the underlying space and the positive linear functionals on\nthe relevant continuous function spaces.\nIt turns out that the right framework is the local compactness which we choose to consider in\nits generality because the class of locally compact spaces includes, other than the Euclidean spaces\nRd , d \u2265 1, and their open or closed subsets, many other topological spaces which are important in\ntheir own right. The reader who is not interested in this level of generality, may replace everywhere\nour locally compact spaces with a space Rd , d \u2265 1, or with an open or a closed subset of it, or with\nthe intersection of an open subset and a closed subset of Rd . However, this restriction does not\nproduce any simplification in the proofs or in the methods.\nIn the sequel, given a locally compact Hausdorff space X, we shall denote by\nK(X)\nthe linear subspace of all real-valued continuous functions on X having compact support. Then\nK(X) \u2282 Cb (X). We shall denote by\nC0 (X)\nthe closure of K(X) with respect to the sup-norm k * k\u221e (see (2.3)). Thus, C0 (X) is a closed\nsubspace of Cb (X) and hence, endowed with the norm k * k\u221e , is a Banach space.\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n119\n\nIf X is compact, then C0 (X) = C(X). If X is not compact, then a function f \u2208 C(X) belongs\nto C0 (X) if and only if\nfor every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a compact subset K of X\nsuch that |f (x)| \u2264 \u03b5 for every x \u2208 X\\K.\nFor additional topological and analytical properties of locally compact spaces and of some relevant\ncontinuous function spaces on them, we refer to the Appendix.\nThe spaces C0 (X) and C(X), (X compact), endowed with the natural pointwise ordering and\nthe sup-norm, become Banach lattices. Similarly Lp (X, \u03bc\ne), endowed with the natural norm k * kp\nand the ordering\nf \u2264 g if f (x) \u2264 g(x) for \u03bc\ne-a.e. x \u2208 X,\n\nis a Banach lattice (for more details on (Lp (X, \u03bc\ne),k * kp ) spaces, we refer to the Appendix (formulae\n(11.11) and (11.12))).\nFor the reader's convenience, we recall that a Banach lattice E is a vector space endowed\nwith a norm k * k and an ordering \u2264 on E such that\n(i) (E, k * k) is a Banach space;\n(ii) (E, \u2264) is a vector lattice;\n(iii) If f, g \u2208 E and |f | \u2264 |g| then kf k \u2264 kgk.\n\n(where |f | := sup(f, \u2212f ) for every f \u2208 E).\nActually it is convenient to state the main definitions of the theory in the framework of Banach\nlattices. However, the reader not accustomed to this terminology may replace our abstract spaces\nwith the concrete ones such as C0 (X), C(X) or Lp (X, \u03bc\ne). For more details on Banach lattices, we\nrefer, e.g., to [2].\nIf E and F are Banach lattices, a linear operator L : E \u2212\u2192 F is said to be positive if\nL(f ) \u2265 0 for every\n\nf \u2208 E, f \u2265 0.\n\nEvery positive linear operator L : E \u2212\u2192 F is continuous, (see, e.g., [2, Theorem 12.3]). Moreover,\nif E = C(X), X compact, then kLk = kL(1)k.\nA lattice homomorphism S : E \u2212\u2192 F is a linear operator satisfying |S(f )| = S(|f |) for\nevery f \u2208 E. Equivalently, this means that S preserves the finite lattice operation, i.e., for every\nf1 , . . . , fn \u2208 E, n \u2265 2,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nS\ninf fi = inf S(fi ) and S sup fi = sup S(fi ).\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nFor instance, if X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, \u03bc\ne a regular finite Borel measure on X and\n1 \u2264 p < +\u221e, then the natural embedding Jp : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) defined by Jp (f ) := f (f \u2208\nC0 (X)) is a lattice homomorphism.\nAnalogously, if X and Y are compact spaces and \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X is a continuous mapping, then the\ncomposition operator T\u03c6 (f ) := f \u25e6\u03c6, (f \u2208 C(X)), is a lattice homomorphism from C(X) into C(Y ).\nEvery lattice homomorphism is positive and hence continuous. A linear bijection S : E \u2212\u2192 F is a\nlattice homomorphism if and only if S and its inverse S \u22121 are both positive [2, Theorem 7.3]. In\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n120\n\nthis case, we also say that S is a lattice isomorphism. When there exists a lattice isomorphism\nbetween E and F , then we say that E and F are lattice isomorphic.\nThe following definition, which is one of the most important of the theory, is clearly motivated\nby the Korovkin theorem and was first formulated by V. A. Baskakov ([28]).\nDefinition 5.1. A subset M of a Banach lattice E is said to be a Korovkin subset of E if for\nevery sequence (Ln )n\u22651 of positive linear operators from E into E satisfying\n(i) supkLn k < +\u221e,\nn\u22651\n\nand\n(ii) lim Ln (g) = g for every g \u2208 M ,\nn\u2192\u221e\nit turns out that\nlim Ln (f ) = f\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor every\n\nf \u2208 E.\n\nNote that, if E = C(X), X compact space, and the constant function 1 belongs to the linear\nsubspace L(M ) generated by M , then condition (i) is superfluous because it is a consequence of\n(ii).\nAccording to Definition 5.1, we may restate Korovkin's Theorem 3.1 by saying that {1, e1 , e2 }\nis a Korovkin set in C([0, 1]).\nWe also point out that a subset M is a Korovkin subset of E if and only if the linear subspace\nL(M ) generated by M is a Korovkin subset. In the sequel, a linear subspace that is a Korovkin\nsubset will be referred to as a Korovkin subspace of E. If E and F are lattice isomorphic and if\nS : E \u2212\u2192 F is a lattice isomorphism, then a subset M of E is a Korovkin subset in E if and only\nif S(M ) is a Korovkin subset in F .\nKorovkin sets (when they exist) are useful for investigating the convergence of equibounded\nsequences of positive linear operators towards the identity operator or, from the point of view of\napproximation theory, the approximation of every element f \u2208 E by means of (Ln (f ))n\u22651 .\nAccording to Lorentz ([80]), who first proposed a possible generalization, it seems to be equally\ninteresting to study the following more general concept.\nDefinition 5.2. Let E and F be Banach lattices and consider a positive linear operator T : E \u2212\u2192\nF . A subset M of E is said to be a Korovkin subset of E for T if for every sequence (Ln )n\u22651 of\npositive linear operators from E into F satisfying\n(i) supkLn k < +\u221e\nn\u22651\n\nand\n(ii) lim Ln (g) = T (g) for every g \u2208 M ,\nn\u2192\u221e\nit turns out that\nlim Ln (f ) = T (f ) for every\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nf \u2208 E.\n\nThus, such subsets can be used to investigate the convergence of equibounded sequences of\npositive linear operators towards a given positive linear operator T : E \u2212\u2192 F or to approximate\nweakly T by means of (generally, simpler) linear operators Ln , n \u2265 1.\nIn the light of the above definition, two problems arise quite naturally:\nProblem 5.3. Given a positive linear operator T : E \u2212\u2192 F , find conditions under which there\nexists a nontrivial (i.e., the linear subspace generated by it is not dense) Korovkin subset for T . In\nthis case, try to determine some or all of them.\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n121\n\nProblem 5.4. Given a subset M of E, try to determine some or all of the positive linear operators\nT : E \u2192 F (if they exist) for which M is a Korovkin subset.\nIn the next sections, we shall discuss some aspects related to Problem 5.3 (for further details,\nwe refer to [8, Sections 3.3 and 3.4]). As regards Problem 5.4, very few results are available (see,\ne.g., [71], [72-73], [74], [114-116]).\nThe next result furnishes a complete characterization of Korovkin subsets for positive linear\noperators in the setting of C0 (X) spaces. It was obtained by Yu. A. Shashkin ([110]) in the\ncase when X = Y , X compact metric space and T = I the identity operator, by H. Berens and\nG. G. Lorentz ([33]) when X = Y , X topological compact space, T = I, by H. Bauer and K. Donner\n([31]) when X = Y , X locally compact space, T = I, by C. A. Micchelli ([85]) and M. D. Rusk\n([105]) when X = Y , X compact, and by F. Altomare ([4]) in the general form below.\nWe recall that M+\nb (X) denotes the cone of all bounded Radon measures on X (see Appendix).\nTheorem 5.5. Let X and Y be locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Further, assume that X has a\ncountable base and Y is metrizable. Given a positive linear operator T : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 C0 (Y ) and a\nsubset M of C0 (X), the following statements are equivalent:\n(i) M is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X) for T .\n(ii) If \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and y \u2208 Y satisfy \u03bc(g) = T (g)(y) for every g \u2208 M , then \u03bc(f ) = T (f )(y) for\nevery f \u2208 C0 (X).\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii). Fix \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and y \u2208 Y satisfying \u03bc(g) = T (g)(y) for every g \u2208 M . Consider\na decreasing countable base (Un )n\u22651 of open neighborhoods of y in Y and, for every n \u2265 1, choose\n\u03c6n \u2208 K(Y ) such that: 0 \u2264 \u03c6n \u2264 1, \u03c6n (y) = 1 and supp(\u03c6n ) \u2282 Un (see Theorem 11.1 of the\nAppendix).\nAccordingly, define Ln : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 C0 (Y ) by\nLn (f ) := \u03bc(f )\u03c6n + T (f )(1 \u2212 \u03c6n ) (f \u2208 C0 (X)).\nEach Ln is linear, positive and kLn k \u2264 k\u03bck + kT k. Moreover, if g \u2208 M , then\nlim Ln (g) = T (g)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nin\n\nC0 (Y ),\n\nbecause, given \u03b5 > 0, there exists v \u2208 N such that\n|T (g)(z) \u2212 T (g)(y)| \u2264 \u03b5 for every\n\nz \u2208 Uv .\n\nHence, since for every n \u2265 v (thus Un \u2282 Uv ) and for every z \u2208 Y\n|Ln (g)(z) \u2212 T (g)(z)| = \u03c6n (z)|T (g)(z) \u2212 T (g)(y)|,\nwe get\n\nand so kLn (g) \u2212 T (g)k \u2264 \u03b5.\n\n(\n0\nif\n|Ln (g)(z) \u2212 T (g)(z)| =\n\u2264 \u03b5 if\n\nz\u2208\n6 Un ,\nz \u2208 Un ,\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n122\n\nSince M is a Korovkin subset for T , it turns out that, for every f \u2208 C0 (X), lim Ln (f ) = T (f )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nand hence lim Ln (f )(y) = T (f )(y). But, for every n \u2265 1, Ln (f )(y) = \u03bc(f ) and this completes the\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nproof of (ii).\n(ii)\u21d2(i). Our proof starts with the observation that from statement (ii), it follows that\nif\n\n\u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X)\n\nand\n\n\u03bc(g) = 0 for every\n\ng \u2208 M,\n\nthen\n\n\u03bc = 0.\n\n(5.1)\n\nMoreover, since X has a countable base, every bounded sequence in M+\nb (X) has a vaguely convergent subsequence (see Theorem 11.8 of Appendix). Consider now a sequence (Ln )n\u22651 of positive\nlinear operators from C0 (X) into C0 (Y ) satisfying properties (i) and (ii) of Definition 5.2 and\nassume that for some f0 \u2208 C0 (X) the sequence (Ln (f0 ))n\u22651 does not converge uniformly to T (f0 ).\nTherefore, there exist \u03b50 > 0, a subsequence (Lk(n) )n\u22651 of (Ln )n\u22651 and a sequence (yn )n\u22651 in\nY such that\n|Lk(n) (f0 )(yn ) \u2212 T (f0 )(yn )| \u2265 \u03b50 for every n \u2265 1.\n(5.2)\nWe discuss separately the two cases when (yn )n\u22651 is converging to the point at infinity of Y or not\n(see the Appendix).\nIn the first case (which can only occur when Y is noncompact), we have lim h(yn ) = 0 for\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nevery h \u2208 C0 (Y ).\nFor every n \u2265 1, define \u03bcn \u2208 M+\nb (X) by\n\u03bcn (f ) := Lk(n) (f )(yn ) (f \u2208 C0 (X)).\n\nSince k\u03bcn k \u2264 kLk(n) k \u2264 M := supkLn k, replacing, if necessary, the sequence (\u03bcn )n\u22651 with a\nn\u22651\n\nsuitable subsequence, we may assume that there exists \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) such that \u03bcn \u2212\u2192 \u03bc vaguely.\nBut, if g \u2208 M , then\n|\u03bcn (g)| \u2264 |Lk(n) (g)(yn ) \u2212 T (g)(yn )| + |T (g)(yn )| \u2264\n\u2264 kLk(n) (g) \u2212 T (g)k + |T (g)(yn )|\nso that\n\u03bc(g) = lim \u03bcn (g) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nFrom (5.1) it turns out that \u03bc(f0 ) = 0 as well and hence\n|Lk(n) (f0 )(yn ) \u2212 T (f0 )(yn )| = |\u03bcn (f0 ) \u2212 T (f0 )(yn )| \u2212\u2192 0\nwhich contradicts (5.2).\nConsider now the case where the sequence (yn )n\u22651 does not converge to the point at infinity of\nY . Then, by replacing it with a suitable subsequence, we may assume that it converges to some\ny \u2208Y.\nAgain, consider for every n \u2265 1\n\u03bcn (f ) := Lk(n) (f )(yn ) (f \u2208 C0 (X)).\nAs in the previous reasoning, we may assume that there exists \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) such that \u03bcn \u2212\u2192 \u03bc\nvaguely. Then, for g \u2208 M , since\n|\u03bcn (g) \u2212 T (g)(yn )| \u2264 kLk(n) (g) \u2212 T (g)k \u2212\u2192 0,\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n123\n\nwe get \u03bc(g) = T (g)(y). Therefore, assumption (ii) implies \u03bc(f0 ) = T (f0 )(y), or equivalently,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nlim Lk(n) (f0 )(yn ) \u2212 T (f0 )(yn ) = 0\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich is impossible because of (5.2).\n\n\u0003\n\nSome applications of Theorem 4.5 will be shown in subsequent sections.\n\n6\n\nKorovkin-type theorems for the identity operator in C0 (X)\n\nIn this section, we discuss more closely those subsets of C0 (X) that are Korovkin subsets in C0 (X)\n(see Definition 4.1), i.e., that are Korovkin subsets for the identity operator on C0 (X).\nThroughout the whole section, we shall fix a locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable\nbase, which is then metrizable as well. The next result immediately follows from Theorem 4.5.\nTheorem 6.1. ([31]). Given a subset M of C0 (X), the following statements are equivalent:\n(i) M is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\n(ii) If \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and x \u2208 X satisfy \u03bc(g) = g(x) for every g \u2208 M , then \u03bc(f ) = f (x) for every\nf \u2208 C0 (X), i.e., \u03bc = \u03b4x (see (2.11)).\nIn order to discuss a first application of Theorem 6.1, we recall that a mapping \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X\nbetween two locally compact Hausdorff spaces Y and X is said to be proper if for every compact\nsubset K \u2208 X, the inverse image \u03c6\u22121 (K) := {y \u2208 Y | \u03c6(y) \u2208 K} is compact in Y . In this case,\nf \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2208 C0 (Y ) for every f \u2208 C0 (X).\nCorollary 6.2. Let Y be a metrizable locally compact Hausdorff space. If M is a Korovkin subset\nof C0 (X), then M is a Korovkin subset for any positive linear operator T : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 C0 (Y ) of\nthe form\nT (f ) := \u03bb(f \u25e6 \u03c6) (f \u2208 C0 (X))\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 Cb (Y ), \u03bb \u2265 0, and \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X is a proper mapping.\nProof. According to Theorem 5.5, we have to show that, if \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and y \u2208 Y satisfy\n\u03bc(g) = \u03bb(y)g(\u03c6(y)) for every g \u2208 M , then \u03bc(f ) = \u03bb(y)f (\u03c6(y)) for every f \u2208 C0 (X).\nIf \u03bb(y) = 0, then \u03bc = 0 on M and hence \u03bc = 0 by Theorem 6.1 and property (1) in the proof\n1\n\u03bc and \u03c6(y).\n\u0003\n(ii) =\u21d2 (i) of Theorem 5.5. If \u03bb(y) > 0, it suffices to apply Theorem 6.1 to\n\u03bb(y)\nNote that, if Y is a closed subset of X, then the canonical mapping \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X defined by\n\u03c6(y) := y (y \u2208 Y ) is proper. Therefore, from Corollary 5.2, we get:\nCorollary 6.3. Let M be a Korovkin subset of C0 (X). Consider an equibounded sequence (Ln )n\u22651\nof positive linear operators from C0 (X) into C0 (X). Then the following properties hold.\n1) Given a closed subset Y of X and \u03bb \u2208 Cb (Y ), \u03bb \u2265 0, if lim Ln (g) = \u03bbg uniformly on Y for\nn\u2192\u221e\nevery g \u2208 M , then\nlim Ln (f ) = \u03bbf\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nuniformly on Y\n\nfor every\n\nf \u2208 C0 (X).\n\n\fF.

We begin with the following result which is at the root of all subsequent results. We\nrecall that, if M is a subset of C0 (M ), then the symbol L(M ) denotes the linear subspace of C0 (X)\ngenerated by M .\nProposition 6.4. Let M be a subset of C0 (X) and assume that for every x, y \u2208 X, x 6= y, there\nexists h \u2208 L(M ), h \u2265 0, such that h(x) = 0 and h(y) > 0. Then M is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nProof. We shall verify condition (ii) of Theorem 6.1. Therefore, consider \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and x \u2208 X\nsatisfying \u03bc(g) = g(x) for every g \u2208 M and, hence, for every g \u2208 L(M ).\nIf y \u2208 X, y 6= x, then there exists h \u2208 L(M ), h \u2265 0, such that h(y) > 0 and 0 = h(x) = \u03bc(h).\nTherefore, by Theorem 11.7 of the Appendix, there exists \u03b1 \u2265 0 such that \u03bc = \u03b1\u03b4x . Choosing\nh \u2208 L(M ) such that h(x) > 0, we get \u03b1h(x) = \u03bc(h) = h(x), so \u03b1 = 1 and \u03bc = \u03b4x .\n\u0003\nBelow, we state an important consequence of Proposition 6.4. In the sequel, if M is a subset of\nC(X) and for f0 \u2208 C(X), we shall set\nf0 M := {f0 * f | f \u2208 M }\n\n(6.1)\n\nf0 M 2 := {f0 * f 2 | f \u2208 M }.\n\n(6.2)\n\nand\nTheorem 6.5. Consider a strictly positive function f0 \u2208 C0 (X) and a subset M of C(X) that\nseparates the points of X. Furthermore, assume that f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 \u2282 C0 (X). Then {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a\nf0 M 2 is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nIf, in addition, M is finite, say M = {f1 , . . . , fn }, n \u2265 1, then\n)\n(\nn\nX\nfi2\nf0 , f0 f1 , . . . , f0 fn , f0\ni=1\n\nis a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nProof. If x, y \u2208 X, x 6= y, then there exists f \u2208 M such that f (x) 6= f (y). Therefore, the function\nh := f0 (f \u2212 f (x))2 belongs to L({f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 ), it is positive and h(x) = 0 < h(y). Thus the\nresult follows from Proposition 6.4.\nIf M = {f1 , . . . , fn } is finite, then in the above reasoning one can consider the function h :=\nn\nP\nf0 (fi \u2212 fi (x))2 .\n\u0003\ni=1\n\nThe next result is an obvious consequence of Theorem 6.5 but is worth being stated explicitly\nbecause of its connection with the Stone-Weierstrass theorem (see Section 9).\n\nTheorem 6.6. Consider a strictly positive function f0 \u2208 C0 (X) and a subset M of C0 (X) that\nseparates the points of X. Then {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nMoreover, if M is finite, say M = {f1 , . . . , fn }, n \u2265 1, then\n)\n(\nn\nX\n2\nfi\nf0 , f0 f1 , . . . , f0 fn , f0\ni=1\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n125\n\nis a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nFinally, if f0 is also injective, then {f0 , f02 , f03 } is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nFrom Theorem 6.6, the following result immediately follows.\nCorollary 6.7.\n\n(1) {e1 , e2 , e3 } is a Korovkin subset of C0 (]0, 1]).\n\n(2) {e\u22121 , e\u22122 , e\u22123 } is a Korovkin subset of C0 ([1, +\u221e[), where e\u2212k (x) := x\u2212k for every x \u2208\n[1, +\u221e[ and k = 1, 2, 3.\n(3) {f1 , f2 , f3 } is a Korovkin subset of C0 ([0, +\u221e[) where fk (x) := exp (\u2212kx) for every x \u2208\n[0, +\u221e[ and k = 1, 2, 3.\n(4) {\u03a6, pr1 \u03a6, . . . , prd \u03a6, k * k2 \u03a6} is a Korovkin subset of C0 (Rd ), d \u2265 1, where \u03a6(x) := exp(\u2212kxk2 )\nfor every x \u2208 Rd .\nA useful generalization of the previous result is presented below.\nProposition 6.8.

We give the proof only for (3); the proofs of the other statements are left to the reader\n(see, e.g., [8, Proposition 4.2.4]). We shall apply Proposition 6.4 and to this end fix x0 \u2208 [0, +\u221e[.\nThen, by using differential calculus, it is not difficult to show that the function\nh(x) := exp(\u2212\u03bb1 x) + \u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03bb2 x) + \u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03bb3 x) (x \u2265 0)\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb1\n\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb3\nexp((\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb1 )x0 ) and \u03b2 :=\nexp((\u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb1 )x0 ), satisfies h(x0 ) = 0 < h(y)\n\u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb2\nfor every y \u2208 [0, +\u221e[, y 6= x0 .\n\u0003\nwhere \u03b1 :=\n\nHere, we discuss some applications of Proposition 6.8. The first application is taken from [31,\nProposition 4.1].\nWe begin by recalling that, if \u03c6 \u2208 L1 ([0, +\u221e[), then the Laplace transform of \u03c6 on [0, +\u221e[\nis defined by\nZ\n+\u221e\n\nL(\u03c6)(\u03bb) :=\n\ne\u2212\u03bbt \u03c6(t) dt\n\n(\u03bb \u2265 0).\n\n(6.3)\n\n0\n\nBy Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, L(\u03c6) \u2208 C0 ([0, +\u221e[) and kL(\u03c6)k \u2264 k\u03c6k1 . By means\nof \u03c6, we may naturally define a linear operator L\u03c6 : C0 ([0, +\u221e[) \u2192 C0 ([0, +\u221e[) by setting for every\nf \u2208 C0 ([0, +\u221e[) and x \u2265 0\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\nf (u)\u03c6(x \u2212 u) du.\n(6.4)\nf (x + y)\u03c6(y) dy =\nL\u03c6 (f )(x) :=\n0\n\nx\n\n\fF.

Finally, if \u03c6 \u2265 0, then L\u03c6 is positive as well.\nFor every \u03bb > 0, denoting by f\u03bb the function\nf\u03bb (x) := exp(\u2212\u03bbx) (x \u2265 0),\n\n(6.5)\n\nL\u03c6 (f\u03bb ) = L(\u03c6)(\u03bb)f\u03bb .\n\n(6.6)\n\nwe get\nProposition 6.9. Consider a sequence (\u03c6n )n\u22651 of positive functions in L1 ([0, +\u221e[) such that\nsupk\u03c6n k1 < +\u221e and, for every n \u2265 1, denote by\nn\u22651\n\nLn : C0 ([0, +\u221e[) \u2192 C0 ([0, +\u221e[)\nthe positive linear operator associated with \u03c6n defined by (6.4). Then the following statements are\nequivalent:\n(i) lim Ln (f ) = f uniformly on [0, +\u221e[ for every f \u2208 C0 ([0, +\u221e[).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(ii) lim L(\u03c6n )(\u03bb) = 1 for every \u03bb > 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(iii) There exist \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 \u2208 R, 0 < \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < \u03bb3 such that\nlim L(\u03c6n )(\u03bbk ) = 1 for\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nk = 1, 2, 3.\n\nProof. The implication (i)\u21d2(ii) follows from (6.6). The implication (ii)\u21d2(iii) being obvious, the\nonly point remaining concerns (iii)\u21d2(i).\nSince (\u03c6n )n\u22651 is bounded in L1 ([0, +\u221e[), we have supkLn k < +\u221e. Moreover, (iii) means that\nn\u22651\n\nlim Ln (f\u03bbk ) = f\u03bbk uniformly on [0, +\u221e[) by (6.6). Therefore, (i) follows by applying part (3) of\nn\u2192\u221e\nProposition 6.8.\n\u0003\nAs another application of the previous results, we shall study the behaviour of the Sz\u00e1szMirakjan operators (see (4.43)) on C0 ([0, +\u221e[) and on continuous function spaces on [0, +\u221e[ with\npolynomial weights.\nWe recall that these operators are defined by\nMn (f )(x) := exp(\u2212nx)\n\n\u221e\n\u0010 k \u0011 n k xk\nX\nf\nn k!\n\n(6.7)\n\nk=0\n\nfor n \u2265 1, x \u2265 0 and f \u2208 C([0, +\u221e[) such that |f (x)| \u2264 M exp(\u03b1x) (x \u2265 0) for some M \u2265 0 and\n\u03b1 > 0.\nLemma 6.10.

The function Mn (f ) is continuous because the series (6.7) is uniformly convergent on\ncompact subsets of [0, +\u221e[.

Since (Mn )n\u22651 is an equibounded sequence of positive linear operators from C0 ([0, +\u221e[)\ninto C0 ([0, +\u221e[), by Proposition 6.8, (3), it is sufficient to show that, for every \u03bb \u2265 0,\nlim Mn (f\u03bb ) = f\u03bb\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nuniformly on\n\n[0, +\u221e[\n\nwhere f\u03bb is defined by (6.5).\nA simple calculation indeed shows that\nh\n\u0010 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bb/n) \u0011i\nMn (f\u03bb )(x) = exp \u2212 \u03bbx\n\u03bb/n\nfor every x \u2265 0. Since lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03bb/n)\n\u03bb/n\n\n= 1, the sequence (Mn (f\u03bb ))n\u22651 converges pointwise to\n\nf\u03bb and is decreasing. Moreover, each Mn (f\u03bb ) and f\u03bb vanishes at +\u221e and so, by Dini's theorem\napplied in the framework of the compactification [0, +\u221e], we obtain the uniform convergence as\nwell.\n\u0003\nOur next aim is to discuss the behaviour of the operators Mn on continuous function spaces\nwith polynomial weights. This naturally leads to investigate some Korovkin-type results in weighted\ncontinuous function spaces. For further results in this respect, we also refer to the next Section 8\nand to [10-11], [14], [60-62], [104].\nConsider again an arbitrary locally compact Hausdorff space X having a countable base. Let\nw be a continuous weight on X, i.e., w \u2208 C(X) and w(x) > 0 for every x \u2208 X, and set\nC0w (X) := {f \u2208 C(X) | wf \u2208 C0 (X)}.\n\n(6.8)\n\nThe space C0w (X), endowed with the natural (pointwise) order and the weighted norm\nkf kw := kwf k\u221e\nis a Banach lattice\n\n(f \u2208 C0w (X))\n\n(6.9)\n\n\fF.

The spaces\nC0w (X) and C0 (X) are lattice isomorphic, a lattice isomorphism between C0 (X) and C0w (X) being\nthe linear operator S : C0 (X) \u2192 C0w (X) defined by\nS(f ) := w\u22121 f\n\n(f \u2208 C0 (X)).\n\n(6.10)\n\nTherefore, if M is a subset of C0w (X), then M is a Korovkin subset of C0w (X) if and only if\nwM := {wf | f \u2208 M }\n\n(6.11)\n\nis a Korovkin subset of C0 (X).\nAccordingly, from Proposition 6.4 and Theorem 6.5, we immediately obtain the following result.\nCorollary 6.12. Given a subset M of C0w (X), the following statements hold:\n(1) If for every x, y \u2208 X, x 6= y, there exists h \u2208 L(M ), h \u2265 0, such that h(x) = 0 < h(y), then\nM is a Korovkin subset of C0w (X).\n(2) Assume that w \u2208 C0 (X).

Consider a locally compact subset X of Rd , d \u2265 1, and w \u2208 C0 (X) such that\nk * k2 w \u2208 C0 (X). Then {1, pr1 , . . . , prd , k * k2 } is a Korovkin subset of C0w (X).\nFrom the previous Corollary 6.13, it follows in particular that, if X is a noncompact real interval,\nthen {1, e1 , e2 } is a Korovkin subset of C0w (X) for any w \u2208 C0 (X) such that e2 w \u2208 C0 (X). When\nX \u2282 [0, +\u221e[, this result can be considerably generalized.\nCorollary 6.14. Let X be a noncompact subinterval of [0, +\u221e[ and let w \u2208 C0 (X) be a weight on\nX. Consider \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 \u2208 R such that 0 < \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 and e\u03bb2 \u2208 C0w (X). Then {1, e\u03bb1 , e\u03bb2 } is a Korovkin\nsubset of C0w (X).\nProof. First note that e\u03bb1 \u2208 C0w (X) because x\u03bb1 \u2264 1 + x\u03bb2 for every x \u2265 0. In order to get the\nresult, we shall apply part (1) of Corollary 6.12 by showing that for a given x0 \u2208 X there exists\nh \u2208 L({1, e\u03bb1 , e\u03bb2 ) such that h(x0 ) = 0 < h(y) for any y \u2208 X, y 6= x0 .\nSet a := inf X \u2265 0. If x0 = a, then it is sufficient to consider h(x) = x\u03bb1 \u2212 a\u03bb1 (x \u2208 X). If X\nis upper bounded and x0 = sup X, then we may consider h(x) = x\u03bb0 1 \u2212 x\u03bb1 (x \u2208 X). Finally if x0\nbelongs to the interior of X, then by means of differential calculus it is not difficult to show that\nthe function\nh(x) := (\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb1 )x\u03bb0 2 \u2212 \u03bb2 x\u03bb0 2 \u2212\u03bb1 x\u03bb1 + \u03bb1 x\u03bb2 (x \u2208 X)\nsatisfies the required properties.\nFrom (6.11) and Proposition (6.8), (3), we also get:\n\n\u0003\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n129\n\nCorollary 6.15.

Consider a continuous bounded weight w \u2208 Cb (X). Then every Korovkin\nsubset of C0 (X) is a Korovkin subset of C0w (X) as well.\nProof. Let M be a Korovkin subset of C0 (X). In order to show that M is a Korovkin subset\nof C0w (X), we shall show that wM is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X). To this end, fix \u03bc \u2208 M+ (X)\nand x \u2208 X such that \u03bc(wg) = w(x)g(x) for every g \u2208 M , and consider the positive linear form\n\u03bd : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 R defined by \u03bd(f ) := \u03bc(wf )/w (f \u2208 C0 (X)). Then \u03bd \u2208 M+\nb (X) and \u03bd(g) = g(x)\nfor every g \u2208 M . From Theorem 6.1, we then conclude that \u03bd(f ) = f (x) for every f \u2208 C0 (X), i.e.,\n\u03bc(wf ) = w(x)f (x) for every f \u2208 C0 (X).\nNote that if \u03c6 \u2208 K(X), after setting f := \u03c6/w \u2208 K(X), we get \u03c6 = wf and hence \u03bc(\u03c6) = \u03c6(x).\nBy density, we conclude that \u03bc(f ) = f (x) for every f \u2208 C0 (X) and hence the desired result follows\nfrom Theorem 6.1.\n\u0003\nTwo simple applications of Corollary 6.13 and Proposition 6.16 are shown below.

In [32, Lemma 5], it was shown that every Mn is a bounded linear operator from C0wm\ninto C0wm and that supkMn k < +\u221e. For every \u03bb > 0 consider again the function f\u03bb (x) :=\nx\u22650\n\nexp(\u2212\u03bbx) (x \u2265 0). By Propositions 6.8 and 6.16, the subset {f\u03bb1 , f\u03bb2 , f\u03bb3 } is a Korovkin subset\nof C0wm ([0, +\u221e[) provided that 0 < \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < \u03bb3 . On the other hand, for each function f\u03bb , we\nhave already shown that lim Mn (f\u03bb ) = f\u03bb uniformly on [0, +\u221e[ (see the proof of Theorem 6.11)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nand hence the same limit relationship holds with respect to k * kwm because k * kwm \u2264 k * k\u221e on\nC0 ([0, +\u221e[) and hence the result follows.\n\u0003\nRemarks 6.18.\n1.

However, in this particular case, some of them have a particular relevance and\nhence are worth an explicit description.\nFrom Theorem 6.5, by replacing f0 with the constant function 1, the following result immediately follows.\nTheorem 7.1. If M is a subset of C(X) that separates the points of X, then {1} \u222a M \u222a M 2 is a\nKorovkin subset of C(X).\n\u001a\n\u001b\nn\nP\n2\nMoreover, if M = {f1 , . . . , fn }, n \u2265 1, is finite, then 1, f1 , . . . , fn ,\nfi is a Korovkin subset\ni=1\n\nof C(X).\nIn particular, if f \u2208 C(X) is injective, then {1, f, f 2 } is a Korovkin subset of C(X).\n\nTheorem 7.1 extends both the Korovkin Theorems 3.1 and 4.3 as well as Volkov's Theorem 4.2.\nIt was obtained by Freud ([59]) for finite subsets M and by Schempp ([106]) in the general case.\nBy adapting the proof of Proposition 6.8 and by using Proposition 6.4, it is not difficult to show\nthat:\n\n\fF.

We denote by\nA(K)\nthe subspace of all real-valued continuous affine functions on K. We recall that a function u : K \u2192 R\nis said to be affine if\nu(\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) = \u03bbu(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)u(y)\n(7.1)\nfor every x, y \u2208 K and \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], or, equivalently, if\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u03bbi u(xi )\n\u03bbi xi ) =\nu(\n\n(7.2)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nP\nfor every n \u2265 2, x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 K and \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2265 0 such that ni=1 \u03bbi = 1.\nNote that A(K) contains the constant functions as well as the restrictions to K of every continuous linear functional on E so that, by the Hahn-Banach theorem, A(K) separates the points\nof K. Therefore, from Theorem 7.1, we immediately get:\nCorollary 7.3. A(K) \u222a A(K)2 is a Korovkin subset of C(K).\nConsider now a continuous\n\u03bcx )x\u2208K of probability Borel measures on K, i.e., for every\nR selection (e\n\u03bcx is continuous on K.

Such a selection will be referred to as the canonical continuous\nselection associated with T .\nFrom now on, we fix a continuous selection (e\n\u03bcx )x\u2208K of probability Borel measures on K satisfying\nZ\nu de\n\u03bcx = u(x)\n\nfor every\n\nu \u2208 A(K),\n\n(7.4)\n\nK\n\nnamely,\n\nT (u) = u\n\nfor every\n\nu \u2208 A(K).\n\n(7.5)\n\nProperty (7.4) means that each x \u2208 K is the barycenter or the resultant of \u03bc\nex ([39, Vol. II,\nDef. 26.2]).\nFor every n \u2265 1 and x \u2208 K, denote by\n\u03bc\ne(n)\nx\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n133\n\nthe product measure on K n of \u03bc\nex with itself n times (see, e.g., [30, \u00a722]) and set, for every f \u2208 C(K),\nZ\n\u0010x + * * * + x \u0011\n1\nn\nf\nBn (f )(x) :=\nde\n\u03bc(n)\n(7.6)\nx (x1 , . . . , xn ).\nn\nKn\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can also write\nZ\nZ\n\u0010x + * * * + x \u0011\n1\nn\nde\n\u03bcx (x1 ) * * * de\n\u03bcx (xn ).\nf\n***\nBn (f )(x) =\nn\nK\nK\n\n(7.7)\n\nBy the continuity property of the product measure (see [39, Vol. I, Proposition 13.12] and [30,\nTheorem 30.8]) and the continuity of the selection, it follows that Bn (f ) \u2208 C(K).\nThe positive linear operator Bn : C(K) \u2212\u2192 C(K) is referred to as the n-th BernsteinSchnabl operator associated with the given selection (e\n\u03bcx )x\u2208K (or the given positive linear operator T : C(K) \u2212\u2192 C(K)).\nBernstein-Schnabl operators were introduced for the first time in 1968 by Schnabl ([107-108])\nin the context of the set of all probability Radon measures on a compact Hausdorff space and, as\nwe shall see next, they generalize the classical Bernstein operators (3.5). Subsequently, Grossman\n([66]) introduced the general definition (7.6) (or (7.7)). In the particular case of Bauer simplices\n(see, e.g., [8, Section 1.5, p. 59]), these operators have been extensively studied by Nishishiraho ([8791]). Another particular class of them has been also studied by Altomare ([5]). Their construction\nessentially involves positive projections and, in this case, they satisfy many additional properties\nuseful in the study of evolution problems (see the end of Section 10). For some shape preserving\nproperties of these operators, we also refer to Ra\u015fa ([97-99]).\nFor a comprehensive survey on these operators, we refer to [8, Chapter 6] and to the references\ncontained in the relevant notes. More recent results can be also found in [7], [18], [19], [24-25],\n[100-102], [103].\nBelow, we discuss some examples.\nExamples 7.4.\n1.

In this section, we shall develop this method\nby also showing some additional Korovkin-type results in weighted continuous function spaces\nthat complement the ones already discussed at the end of Section 6, and then by presenting the\ncorresponding ones in Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)-spaces.\nThe method relies on a fundamental characterization of Korovkin subspaces which is due to\nBauer and Donner ([31]) (see also [8, Theorem 4.1.2]). Its counterpart for Korovkin subspaces\nfor positive linear operators was obtained in [8, Theorem 3.1.4]. An extension to locally convex\nfunction spaces was obtained in [10]. For the sake of brevity, we omit its proof.\nAs in the previous section, X denotes a fixed locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable\nbase.\nTheorem 8.1. ([31]) Given a linear subspace H of C0 (X), the following statements are equivalent:\n(i) H is a Korovkin subspace of C0 (X);\n(ii) For every f \u2208 C0 (X) and for every \u03b5 > 0, there exist finitely many functions h0 , . . . , hn \u2208 H,\nk0 , . . . , kn \u2208 H and u, v \u2208 C0 (X), u, v \u2265 0 such that kuk \u2264 \u03b5, kvk \u2264 \u03b5 and\ninf kj \u2212 sup hi \u2264 \u03b5 and\n\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n0\u2264i\u2264n\n\nsup hi \u2212 u \u2264 f \u2264 inf kj + v.\n\n0\u2264i\u2264n\n\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\nRemark 8.2. If X is compact and 1 \u2208 H, then Theorem 8.1 can be stated in a simpler form (see\n[8, Theorem 4.1.4]).\nLet us mention two important consequences of Theorem 8.1.\nTheorem 8.3. ([31]). Let H be a Korovkin subspace of C0 (X). If E is a Banach lattice and if\nS : C0 (X) \u2192 E is a lattice homomorphism, then H is a Korovkin subspace of C0 (X) for S.\nProof. Consider a sequence (Ln )n\u22651 of positive linear operators from C0 (X) into E such that\nM := supkLn k < +\u221e and limn\u2192\u221e Ln (h) = S(h) for every h \u2208 H.

From Theorem 8.3, it follows that, if M is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X), then M is\na Korovkin subset for the natural embedding from C0 (X) into an arbitrary closed lattice subspace\nE of B(X) containing C0 (X) (for instance, E = Cb (X) or E = B(X)).\nAnother consequence of Theorem 8.3 is indicated below.\nProposition 8.5. ([120]). Let E be a Banach lattice and consider a lattice homomorphism S :\nC0 (X) \u2192 E such that S(C0 (X)) is dense in E. If M is a Korovkin subspace of C0 (X), then S(M )\nis a Korovkin subspace of E.\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n137\n\nProof. Consider an equibounded sequence (Ln )n\u22651 of positive linear operators on E and assume\nthat Ln (k) \u2192 k as n \u2192 \u221e for every k \u2208 S(M ). This means that Ln (S(h)) \u2192 S(h) as n \u2192 \u221e for\neach h \u2208 M and hence for each h \u2208 H := L(M ). So, by Theorem 8.3, Ln (S(f )) \u2212\u2192 S(f ) for every\nf \u2208 C0 (X). The result now follows from the assumption that S(C0 (X)) is dense in E and (Ln )n\u22651\nis equibounded.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.6. A typical situation where Proposition 8.5 can be applied concerns the case when E\nis a Banach lattice containing C0 (X) as a dense sublattice and S is the natural embedding from\nC0 (X) into E. Thus, in this case,\nevery Korovkin subspace of C0 (X) is a Korovkin subspace of E as well.\nAfter these preliminaries, we can now proceed to discuss some Korovkin-type results for Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)\nspaces.\nConsider a Borel measure \u03bc\ne on X and, given p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[, consider the space\nLp (X, \u03bc\ne)\n\nendowed with its natural norm k * kp (for more details, we refer to the Appendix (formulae (11.11)\nand (11.12))).\nSince \u03bc\ne is regular, K(X) is dense in Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) with respect to the convergence in p-th mean (see\nTheorem 11.4 of Appendix). Therefore, we get the following useful results.\n\nCorollary 8.7. Let M be a Korovkin subset of C0 (X). Furthermore, let Y be a locally compact\nHausdorff space with a countable base and consider a Borel measure \u03bc\ne on Y and p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[. Let\nS : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 Lp (Y, \u03bc\ne) be a lattice homomorphism such that K(Y ) \u2282 S(C0 (X)). Then S(M ) is a\nKorovkin subset of Lp (Y, \u03bc\ne).\nIn particular, if \u03bc\ne is a finite Borel measure on X, then M is also a Korovkin subset of Lp (X, \u03bc\ne).\n\nCorollary 8.8. Let X be a compact subset of Rd , d \u2265 1, and consider a finite Borel measure \u03bc\ne on\nd\nP\nX. Then {1, pr1 , . . . , prd ,\npri2 } is a Korovkin subset of Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) for every p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[.\ni=1\n\nIf, in addition, X is contained in some sphere of Rd , then {1, pr1 , . . . , prd } is a Korovkin subset\nof Lp (X, \u03bc\ne).\nCorollary 8.9. Consider 0 < \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < \u03bb3 and p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[. Then\n\n(1) {f\u03bb1 , f\u03bb2 , f\u03bb3 } is a Korovkin subset of Lp ([0, +\u221e[), where f\u03bbk (x) := exp(\u2212\u03bbk x) for every\nx \u2208 [0, +\u221e[ and k = 1, 2, 3.\n(2) If u : R \u2212\u2192]0, 1[ is a strictly increasing continuous function satisfying\n\nlim u(x) = 0 and\n\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim u(x) = 1, then\n\nx\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n{\u03a6, \u03a6u\u03bb1 , \u03a6u\u03bb2 }\nis a Korovkin subset of Lp (R), where \u03a6(x) := exp(\u2212x2 ) (x \u2208 R).\nProof. (1) Consider the lattice homomorphism S : C([0, 1]) \u2192 Lp ([0, +\u221e[) defined by\nS(f )(x) := exp(\u2212\u03bb1 x)f (exp(\u2212x)) (f \u2208 C([0, 1]), x \u2265 0).\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n138\n\nThen S maps the subset M := {1, e\u03bb2 \u2212\u03bb1 , e\u03bb3 \u2212\u03bb1 } into\n{f\u03bb1 , f\u03bb2 , f\u03bb3 }.\nHence the result follows from Corollary 8.7 and Proposition 7.2, (1).\n(2) A similar reasoning can be used by considering now the lattice homomorphism S : C([0, 1]) \u2192\np\nL (R) defined by\nS(f )(x) := exp(\u2212x2 )f (u(x)) (f \u2208 C([0, 1]), x \u2208 R).\n\u0003\nWe now proceed to state a result analogous to Corollary 8.7 for more general weighted function\nspaces (see Section 6). Consider a continuous weight w on X and the relevant weighted space\nC0w (X) defined by (6.8). Note that, if \u03bc\ne is a Borel measure on X and if\nw\u22121 \u2208 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)\n\nfor some p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[.\n\n(8.1)\n\ne) and it is dense with respect to the convergence in the p-th mean.\nthen C0w (X) \u2282 Lp (X, \u03bc\n\nCorollary 8.10. Consider a Korovkin subset M of C0w (X), i.e., wM is a Korovkin subset of C0 (X)\n(see (6.11)), and a Borel measure \u03bc\ne on X. If (8.1) holds, then M is a Korovkin subset of Lp (X, \u03bc\ne).\n\nProof. Consider the lattice homomorphism S : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) defined by S(f ) := w\u22121 f\nw\n(f \u2208 C0 (X)). Then M = S(wM ) and S(C0 (X)) = C0 (X). Therefore, the result follows from\nCorollary 8.7.\n\u0003\nThe previous Corollary together with Corollaries 6.12 - 6.15 furnish a simple but useful method\nto construct Korovkin subsets in Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)-spaces.\nBy using similar methods, we can extend some of the previous results to more general weighted\nfunction spaces which often occur in the applications. Some of the subsequent results are taken\nfrom [22, Section 2].\nIn what follows, we shall assume that X is noncompact and we shall denote by\nX\u221e := X \u222a {\u221e}\nthe Alexandrov one-point compactification of X (see, e.g., [30, \u00a727]). A function f \u2208 C(X) is said\nto be convergent at infinity if there exists a (unique) l \u2208 R such that for any \u03b5 > 0 there exists a\ncompact subset K of X such that |f (x) \u2212 l| \u2264 \u03b5 for each x \u2208 X\\K. In such a case, we also write\nlim f (x) = l. Similarly, we shall write lim f (x) = \u221e to mean that for every M \u2265 0 there exists\nx\u2192\u221e\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\na compact subset K of X such that f (x) \u2265 M for every x \u2208 X\\K.\nGiven a weight w \u2208 C(X), consider the Banach lattice\nC\u2217w (X) := {f \u2208 C(X) | wf is convergent at infinity }\n\n(8.2)\n\nendowed with the natural (pointwise) order and the weighted norm\nkf kw := kwf k\u221e\n\n(f \u2208 C\u2217w (X)).\n\nFor every f \u2208 C\u2217w (X), denote by T (f ) the function on X\u221e defined by\n(\nw(z)f (z)\nif z \u2208 X,\nT (f )(z) :=\nlim w(x)f (x) if z = \u221e.\nx\u2192\u221e\n\n(8.3)\n\n(8.4)\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n139\n\nThen T (f ) \u2208 C(X\u221e ) and kT (f )k\u221e = kf k\u221e . Moreover, the linear operator T : C\u2217w (X) \u2192 C(X\u221e )\nis a lattice isomorphism whose inverse we shall denote by\nS : C(X\u221e ) \u2192 C\u2217w (X).\nThus a subset M of C\u2217w (X) is a Korovkin subset of C\u2217w (X) if and only if T (M ) is a Korovkin subset\nof C(X\u221e ).\nConsider now a Borel measure \u03bc\ne on X and assume that (8.1) holds. Then C\u2217w (X) \u2282 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)\nw\np\nand C\u2217 (X) is dense in L (X, \u03bc\ne) because K(X) \u2282 C\u2217w (X).\n\nProposition 8.11. Under assumption (8.1), each Korovkin subset of C\u2217w (X) is a Korovkin subset\nof Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) as well.\n\nProof. The above lattice isomorphism S can be considered as a lattice homomorphism from C(X\u221e )\ninto Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) and its range is C\u2217w (X) which is dense in Lp (X, \u03bc\ne). Since H := T (M ) is a Korovkin\np\nsubset of C(X\u221e ), then M = S(H) is a Korovkin subset of L (X, \u03bc\ne) by Corollary 8.7.\n\u0003\nBelow, we state some consequences of Proposition 8.11.\n\nProposition 8.12. Let M be a subset of C\u2217w (X) and assume that\n(i) for every x0 , y0 \u2208 X, x0 6= y0 , there exists h \u2208 L(M ), h \u2265 0, such that h(x0 ) = 0 and\nh(y0 ) > 0;\n(ii) for every x0 \u2208 X there exist positive functions h, k \u2208 L(M ) such that\nh(x0 ) = 0,\n\nlim w(x)h(x) > 0,\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\nand\nk(x0 ) > 0,\n\nlim w(x)k(x) = 0.\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\nThen M is a Korovkin subset of C\u2217w (X) and hence of Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) for every Borel measure \u03bc\ne on X\nand for every p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[ satisfying (8.1).\n\nProof. Conditions (i) and (ii) mean that T (M ) satisfies the hypotheses of Propositions 6.4 in\nC(X\u221e ). Therefore, the result follows from Propositions 6.4 and 8.11.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.13. Consider a subset M of C(X) that separates the points of X and a strictly\npositive function f0 \u2208 C0w (X). Further, assume that\n(1) f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 \u2282 C\u2217w (X) (see (6.1) and (6.2)),\n(2) there exists g \u2208 M such that\nlim w(x)f0 (x)g(x) = 0 and lim w(x)f0 (x)g2 (x) > 0.\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\nThen {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 is a Korovkin subset of C\u2217w (X) and hence of Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) for every Borel\nmeasure \u03bc\ne on X and for every p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[ satisfying (8.1).\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n140\n\nProof. We shall verify conditions (i) and (ii) of Proposition 8.12. Given x0 , y0 \u2208 X, x0 6= y0 ,\nthere exists f \u2208 M such that f (x0 ) 6= f (y0 ). Therefore, the function h := f0 (f \u2212 f (x0 ))2 \u2208\nL({f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M 2 ) satisfies h(x0 ) = 0 and h(y0 ) > 0 and hence property (i) follows.\nAs regards condition (ii) of Proposition 8.12, considering a function g \u2208 M satisfying assumption\n(2), then for every x0 \u2208 X the functions h := f0 (g \u2212 g(x0 ))2 and k := f0 satisfy condition (ii) of\nProposition 8.12.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.14.

Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable base and let A be a\nclosed subalgebra of C0 (X) that separates strongly the points of X. Then A = C0 (X).\nProof. We first prove that there exists a strictly positive function f0 in A. For this, note that A\nis separable since C0 (X) is. Denoting by {hn | n \u2265 1} a dense subset of A, then for every x \u2208 X\n\u221e\nP\n|hn |\nthere exists n \u2265 1 such that hn (x) 6= 0. Hence the function f0 :=\n2n khn k lies in A, because of\nn=1\n\nLemma 9.1, and is strictly positive on X.\nGiven such a function f0 \u2208 A, we then have that {f0 } \u222a f0 A \u222a f0 A2 \u2282 A and hence, by Theorem\n6.6, A is a Korovkin subspace in C0 (X).\nConsidering f \u2208 C0 (X) and \u03b5 > 0, by Theorem 8.1 there exist h0 , . . . , hn \u2208 A, k0 , . . . , kn \u2208 A\nas well as u, v \u2208 C0 (X), u \u2265 0, v \u2265 0, such that kuk \u2264 \u03b5, kvk \u2264 \u03b5, and, finally,\ninf kj \u2212 sup hi \u2264 \u03b5 and\n\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n0\u2264i\u2264n\n\nsup hi \u2212 u \u2264 f \u2264 inf kj + v.\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n0\u2264i\u2264n\n\nThen f \u2212 inf kj \u2264 v and\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\ninf kj \u2212 f \u2264 | inf kj \u2212 sup hi | + u.\n\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n0\u2264i\u2264n\n\nTherefore,\n|f \u2212 inf kj | \u2264 | sup hi \u2212 inf kj | + u + v\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n0\u2264i\u2264n\n\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n145\n\nand then\nkf \u2212 inf kj k \u2264 3\u03b5\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\nwhich shows that f \u2208 A = A (since, by Lemma 9.1, inf kj \u2208 A) and this completes the proof. \u0003\n0\u2264j\u2264n\n\nAs in the case of the interval [0, 1] (see Theorem 3.8), we actually show that Theorems 6.6 and\n9.2 are equivalent. The next result will be very useful for our purposes.\nTheorem 9.3. Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space and consider a subset M of C0 (X) such\nthat the linear subspace generated by it contains a strictly positive function f0 \u2208 C0 (X). Given\nx0 \u2208 X, denote by A(M, x0 ) the subspace of all functions f \u2208 C0 (X) such that \u03bc(f ) = f (x0 ) for\n2\nevery \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) satisfying \u03bc(g) = g(x0 ) for every g \u2208 {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M . Then A(M, x0 ) is a\nclosed subalgebra of C0 (X) which contains M .\nProof. A(M, x0 ) is a closed subspace of C0 (X). Set\nM (x0 ) := {x \u2208 X | g(x) = g(x0 ) for every\n=\n\n2\n\n{x \u2208 X | f0 (x)(g(x) \u2212 g(x0 )) = 0\n\ng \u2208 M}\nfor every\n\ng \u2208 M}\n\n2\nand fix f \u2208 A(M, x0 ) and \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) such that \u03bc(g) = g(x0 ) for every g \u2208 {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M .\n2\nIn particular, \u03bc(f0 (g \u2212 g(x0 )) ) = 0 for each g \u2208 M . On the other hand, if x \u2208 M (x0 ), then\n\u03b4x (g) = g(x0 ) for every g \u2208 {f0 }\u222af0 M \u222af0 M 2 , so that f (x) = f (x0 ) and hence f0 (x0 )f 2 = f 2 (x0 )f0\non M (x0 ).\nTherefore, by Corollary 11.6 in the Appendix, we get that \u03bc(f0 (x0 )f 2 ) = f 2 (x0 )\u03bc(f0 ) =\nf 2 (x0 )f0 (x0 ) and hence \u03bc(f 2 ) = f 2 (x0 ). Therefore, f 2 \u2208 A(M, x0 ) and hence A(M, x0 ) is a\nsubalgebra of C0 (X).\nFinally note that, if h \u2208 M, then f0 (x0 )h = h(x0 )f0 on M (x0 ). Therefore, if we again fix\n2\n\u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) such that \u03bc(g) = g(x0 ) for each g \u2208 {f0 } \u222a f0 M \u222a f0 M , by applying Corollary\n11.6 we at once obtain that f0 (x0 )\u03bc(h) = h(x0 )\u03bc(f0 ) = h(x0 )f0 (x0 ), so \u03bc(h) = h(x0 ) and hence\nh \u2208 A(M, x0 ).\n\u0003\n\nWith the help of the preceding theorem, it is easy to show this next result.\nTheorem 9.4. The Korovkin-type Theorem 6.6 and the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem 9.2 are equivalent.\nProof. In light of the proof of Theorem 9.2, we have only to show that Theorem 9.2 implies\nTheorem 6.6. So, consider a subset M of C0 (X) that separates the points of X and such that the\nlinear subspace generated by it contains a strictly positive function f0 \u2208 C0 (X).\nGiven x0 \u2208 X, consider the subspace A(M, x0 ) defined in the preceding theorem. By virtue of\nTheorems 9.2 and 9.3, we then infer that A(M, x0 ) = C0 (X). In other words, we have shown that\n2\nfor every \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and for every x0 \u2208 X satisfying \u03bc(g) = g(x0 ) for every g \u2208 {f0 }\u222af0 M \u222af0 M ,\n2\nwe also have \u03bc(f ) = f (x0 ) for every f \u2208 C0 (X) and this means that {f0 }\u222af0 M \u222af0 M is a Korovkin\nsubset in C0 (X) because of Theorem 6.1.\n\u0003\nFor a further deepening of the relationship between Korovkin-type theorems and Stone-Weierstrass\ntheorems, we refer to [8, Section 4.4] and [12-13].\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n10\n\n146\n\nKorovkin-type theorems for positive projections\n\nIn this last section, we shall discuss some Korovkin-type theorems for a class of positive linear\nprojections by showing a nontrivial application of the general theorem proved in Section 5.\nConsider a compact metric space X and a positive linear projection T : C(X) \u2192 C(X),\ni.e., T is a positive linear operator such that T (T (f )) = T (f ) for every f \u2208 C(X). We shall denote\nby HT the range of T , i.e.,\nHT := T (C(X)) = {h \u2208 C(X) | T (h) = h} .\n\n(10.1)\n\nWe shall also assume that 1 \u2208 HT (hence T (1) = 1) and that HT separates the points of X. In\nthe sequel, we shall present some examples of such projections.\nFor every x \u2208 X denote by \u03bcx \u2208 M+ (X) the Radon measure defined by\n\u03bcx (f ) := T (f )(x) (f \u2208 C(X))\n\n(10.2)\n\nand by \u03bc\nex the unique probability Borel measure on X that corresponds to \u03bcx via the Riesz representation theorem, i.e.,\nZ\nf de\n\u03bcx (f \u2208 C(X)).\n(10.3)\nT (f )(x) = \u03bcx (f ) =\nX\n\nThus, (e\n\u03bcx )x\u2208X is the canonical continuous selection associated with T .\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (2.16), for every h \u2208 HT , we get\np\np\n|h| = |T (h)| \u2264 T (1)T (h2 ) = T (h2 )\nso that\n\nh2 \u2264 T (h2 ) .\n\n(10.4)\n\nYT := {x \u2208 X | T (f )(x) = f (x) for every f \u2208 C(X)}.\n\n(10.5)\n\nSet\nYT is closed and it is actually equal to the so-called Choquet boundary of HT and hence it is not\nempty (see [8, Proposition 3.3.1 and Corollary 2.6.5]).\nProposition 10.1. If M is a subset of HT that separates the points of X, then\nYT = {x \u2208 X | T (h2 )(x) = h2 (x) for every h \u2208 M }.\n\n(10.6)\n\nMoreover, if (hn )n\u22651 is a finite or countable family of HT that separates the points of X and if the\n\u221e\nP\nseries u :=\nh2n is uniformly convergent on X, then u \u2264 T (u) and\nn=1\n\nYT := {x \u2208 X | T u(x) = u(x)}.\n\n(10.7)\n\nProof. Consider x \u2208 X such that T (h2 )(x) = h2 (x), i.e., \u03bcx (h2 ) = h2 (x) for each h \u2208 M . Since\nM \u2282 HT , we also get \u03bcx (h) = h(x) (h \u2208 M ) and {1} \u222a M \u222a M 2 is a Korovkin subset of C(X) by\nTheorem 7.1. According to Theorem 6.1, we then obtain that f (x) = \u03bcx (f ) = T (f )(x) for every\nf \u2208 C(X).\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\nAs regards the second part of the statement, note that T (u) =\n\nn=1\n\nby (10.4).

Note that there always exists a countable family (hn )n\u22651 of HT that separates the\n\u221e\nP\npoints of X and such that the series\nh2n is uniformly convergent on X.

In order to apply Theorem 5.5, consider \u03bc \u2208 M+ (X) and x \u2208 X such that \u03bc(h) =\nT (h)(x) = (\u03bcx (h)) for every h \u2208 HT \u222a M 2 . Accordingly, if h \u2208 M ,\n\u03bc(T (h2 ) \u2212 h2 ) = T (h2 )(x) \u2212 \u03bcx (h2 ) = 0\nand T (h2 ) \u2212 h2 \u2265 0. Therefore, by using (10.6) and by applying Theorem 11.5 and Corollary 11.6\nof the Appendix, we see that, for every f \u2208 C(X), \u03bc(T (f )) = \u03bc(f ) because T f = f on YT . Hence\n\u03bc(f ) = \u03bc(T (f )) = \u03bcx (T f ) = T f (x) and this finishes the proof.\nA similar reasoning can be used to show the second part of the statement by using (10.7) instead\nof (10.6).\n\u0003\nTheorem 10.3 is due to Altomare ([3], [5]; see also [8, Section 3.3]). For an extension to so called\nadapted spaces, we refer to [9]. Below, we show some examples.\nExample 10.4.

Here, we content ourselves to cite, other\nthan Chapter 6 of [8], also the papers [6], [17] and [18] and the references therein.\n\n11\n\nAppendix: A short review of locally compact spaces and of some continuous\nfunction spaces on them\n\nFor the convenience of the reader, in this Appendix, we collect some basic definitions and results\nconcerning locally compact Hausdorff spaces, some continuous function spaces and Radon measures\non them. For more details, we refer the reader to Chapter IV of [30] or to Chapter 3 of [54].\nWe start by recalling that a topological space X is said to be compact if every open cover of X\nhas a finite subcover. A subset of a topological space is said to be compact if it is compact in the\nrelative topology. A topological space is said to be locally compact if each of its points possesses\na compact neighborhood.\nActually, if X is locally compact and Hausdorff (i.e., for every pair of distinct points x1 , x2 \u2208 X\nthere exist neighborhoods U1 and U2 of x1 and x2 , respectively, such that U1 \u2229 U2 = \u2205), then each\npoint of X has a fundamental system of compact neighborhoods.\nEvery compact space is locally compact. The spaces Rd , d \u2265 1, are fundamental examples\nof (noncompact) locally compact spaces. Furthermore, if X is locally compact, then every open\nsubset of X and every closed subset of X, endowed with the relative topology, is locally compact.\nMore generally, a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff space, endowed with the relative topology,\nis locally compact if and only if it is the intersection of an open subset of X with a closed subset\nof X (see [54, Corollary 3.3.10]). Therefore, every real interval is locally compact.\nA topological space X is said to be metrizable if its topology is induced by a metric on X.\nIn this case, we say that X is complete if such a metric is complete. Note that every compact\nmetrizable space is complete and separable, i.e., it contains a dense countable subset.\nA special role in the measure theory on topological spaces (and in the Korovkin-type approximation theory) is played by locally compact Hausdorff spaces with a countable base (or basis),\ni.e., with a countable family of open subsets such that every open subset is the union of some\nsubfamily of it. Such spaces are metrizable, complete and separable. Actually, a metrizable space\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n152\n\nhas a countable base if and only if it is separable. The spaces Rd , d \u2265 1, and each open or closed\nsubset of them are locally compact Hausdorff spaces with a countable base.\nFrom now on, X will stand for a fixed locally compact Hausdorff space. We denote by K(X)\nthe linear space of all real-valued continuous functions f : X \u2212\u2192 R whose (closed) support\nsupp(f ) := {x \u2208 X | f (x) 6= 0}\nis compact. K(X) is a lattice subspace of Cb (X) and it coincides with C(X) if X is compact.\nThe next result shows that there are sufficiently many functions in K(X). (For a proof, see [30,\nCorollary 27.3].)\nTheorem 11.1. (Urysohn's lemma) For every compact subset K of X and for every open subset\nU containing K, there exists \u03c6 \u2208 K(X) such that 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1, \u03c6 = 1 on K and supp(\u03c6) \u2282 U (and\nhence \u03c6 = 0 on X\\U ).\nAnother fundamental function space is the space C0 (X) which is defined as the closure of K(X)\nin Cb (X) with respect to the sup norm, in symbols\nC0 (X) := K(X).\nThus, C0 (X) is a closed linear subspace of Cb (X) and hence, endowed with the sup-norm, is a\nBanach space.\nBy means of Urysohn's lemma, it is not difficult to prove the following characterization of\nfunctions lying in C0 (X).\nTheorem 11.2. Assume that X is not compact. For a function f \u2208 C(X), the following statements\nare equivalent:\n(i) f \u2208 C0 (X);\n(ii) {x \u2208 X | |f (x)| \u2265 \u03b5} is compact for every \u03b5 > 0;\n(iii) for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a compact subset K of X such that |f (x)| \u2264 \u03b5 for every x \u2208 X\\K.\nBecause of the preceding theorem, the functions lying in C0 (X) are said to vanish at infinity. If\nX is compact, then C0 (X) = C(X). Moreover, C0 (X) is a lattice subspace of Cb (X) and, endowed\nwith the sup-norm, is separable provided X has a countable base.\nAnother characterization of functions in C0 (X) involves sequences of points of X that converge\nto the point at infinity of X. More precisely, assuming that X is noncompact, a sequence (xn )n\u22651\nin X is said to converge to the point at infinity of X if for every compact subset K of X there\nexists \u03bd \u2208 N such that xn \u2208 X\\K for every n \u2265 \u03bd. For any such sequence and for every f \u2208 C0 (X),\nwe then have\nlim f (xn ) = 0.\n(11.1)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nConversely, a function f \u2208 C(X) satisfying (11.1) for every sequence (xn )n\u22651 converging to the\npoint at infinity of X necessarily lies in C0 (X) provided that X is countable at infinity, i.e., it is the\nunion of a sequence of compact subsets of X. Note also that X is countable at infinity if and only\nif there exists f0 \u2208 C0 (X) such that f0 (x) > 0 for every x \u2208 X. Moreover, if X has a countable\nbasis, then X is countable at infinity.\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n153\n\nA useful tool which plays an important role in Korovkin-type approximation theory is given by\nRadon measures. Actually, we shall only need to handle positive bounded Radon measures\nwhich are, by definition, positive linear functionals on C0 (X). The set of all of them will be denoted\nby M+\nb (X).\nEvery \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X), that is, every positive linear functional \u03bc : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 R, is continuous\n(with respect to the sup-norm), and its norm\nk\u03bck := sup{|\u03bc(f )| | f \u2208 C0 (X), |f | \u2264 1}\n\n(11.2)\n\nis also called the total mass of \u03bc.\nA simple example of bounded positive Radon measure is furnished by the Dirac measure at\na point a \u2208 X, which is defined by\n\u03b4a (f ) := f (a) (f \u2208 C0 (X)).\n\n(11.3)\n\nA positive linear combination of Dirac measures is called a (positive) discrete measure.\nIn other words, a Radon measure \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) is discrete if there exist finitely many points\na1 , . . . , an \u2208 X, n \u2265 1, and finitely many positive real numbers \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn such that\n\u03bc=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi \u03b4ai ,\n\n(11.4)\n\ni=1\n\ni.e.,\n\u03bc(f ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi f (ai ) for every\n\nf \u2208 C0 (X).\n\n(11.5)\n\ni=1\n\nIn this case, k\u03bck =\n\nn\nP\n\n\u03bbi and \u03bc is also said to be supported on {a1 , . . . , an }.\n\ni=1\n\nThere is a strong relationship between positive bounded Radon measures and (positive) finite\nBorel measures on X. In order to briefly describe it, we recall that the Borel \u03c3-algebra in X is,\nby definition, the \u03c3-algebra generated by the system of all open subsets of X. It will be denoted\nby B(X) and its elements are called Borel subsets of X. Open subsets, closed subsets and compact\nsubsets of X are Borel subsets.\nA Borel measure \u03bc\ne on X is, by definition, a measure \u03bc\ne : B(X) \u2192 [0, +\u221e] such that\n\u03bc\ne(K) < +\u221e for every compact subset K of X.\n\n(11.6)\n\n\u03bc\ne(B) = sup{e\n\u03bc(K) | K \u2282 B, K compact} for every B \u2208 B(X)\n\n(11.7)\n\n\u03bc\ne(B) = inf{e\n\u03bc(U ) | B \u2282 U, U open} for every B \u2208 B(X).\n\n(11.8)\n\nEvery finite measure \u03bc\ne on B(X), i.e., \u03bc\ne(X) < +\u221e, is a Borel measure.\nA measure \u03bc\ne : B(X) \u2212\u2192 [0, +\u221e] is said to be inner regular if\nand outer regular if\n\nA measure \u03bc\ne is said to be regular if it is both inner regular and outer regular. The Lebesgue-Borel\nmeasure on Rd , d \u2265 1, is regular. Actually, if X has a countable base, then every Borel measures\non X is regular ([30, Theorem 29.12]).\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n154\n\nIf \u03bc\ne is a finite measure on B(X), then every f \u2208 Cb (X) is \u03bc\ne-integrable. Therefore, we can\nconsider the positive bounded Radon measure I\u03bce on X defined by\nZ\nf de\n\u03bc (f \u2208 C0 (X)).\n(11.9)\nI\u03bce (f ) :=\nX\n\nThen kI\u03bce k \u2264 \u03bc\ne(X), and, if \u03bc\ne is inner regular, kI\u03bce k = \u03bc\ne(X).\nAs a matter of fact, formula (11.9) describes all the positive bounded Radon measures on X as\nthe following fundamental result shows (see [30, Section 29]).\nTheorem 11.3. (Riesz representation theorem) If \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X), then there exists a unique\nfinite and regular Borel measure \u03bc\ne on X such that\nZ\nf de\n\u03bc for every f \u2208 C0 (X).\n\u03bc(f ) =\nX\n\nMoreover, k\u03bck = \u03bc\ne(X).\n\nAnother noteworthy and useful result concerning regular Borel measures is shown below. Consider a measure \u03bc\ne on B(X) and p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[. As usual, we shall denote by Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) the linear\nsubspace of all B(X)-measurable functions f : X \u2212\u2192 R such that |f |p is \u03bc\ne-integrable.\nIf f \u2208 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne), it is customary to set\nNp (f ) :=\n\n\u0012Z\n\nX\n\n\u00131/p\n.\n|f |p de\n\u03bc\n\n(11.10)\n\nThe functional Np : Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) \u2192 R is a seminorm and the convergence with respect to it is the\nusual convergence in pth -mean. Setting\nN\n\n:= {f \u2208 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) | Np (f ) = 0}\n=\n\nthe quotient linear space\nendowed with the norm\n\n{f \u2208 F (X) | f is B(X) measurable and f = 0 \u03bc\ne a.e.},\nLp (X, \u03bc\ne) := Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)/N\n\nkfekp := Np (f ) (fe \u2208 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne)),\n\n(11.11)\n(11.12)\n\nis a Banach space. (Here, fe := {g \u2208 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) | f = g \u03bc\ne a.e.}.) Note that, if \u03bc\ne is a Borel measure,\nthen K(X) \u2282 Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) for every p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[.\nIf \u03bc\ne is also regular, we can say much more (for a proof of the next result, see [30, Theorem\n29.14]).\n\nTheorem 11.4. If \u03bc\ne is a regular Borel measure on X, then, for every p \u2208 [1, +\u221e[, the space K(X)\np\nis dense in L (X, \u03bc\ne) with the respect to convergence in the pth -mean (and hence in Lp (X, \u03bc\ne) with\nrespect to k * kp ).\n\nNext, we discuss a characterization of discrete Radon measures. Usually this characterization\nis proved by using the notion of support of Radon measures (see, e.g., [36, Chapter III, Section 2]\nand [39, Vol. I, Section 11]). Below, we present a simple and direct proof.\nWe start with the following result which is important in its own right.\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n155\n\nTheorem 11.5. Let \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and consider a closed subset Y of X such that\n\u03bc(\u03c6) = 0 for every \u03c6 \u2208 K(X), supp(\u03c6) \u2282 X\\Y.\n\n(11.13)\n\nThen \u03bc(f ) = \u03bc(g) for every f, g \u2208 C0 (X) such that f = g on Y .\nProof. It suffices to show that, if f \u2208 C0 (X) and f = 0 on Y , then \u03bc(f ) = 0. Consider such a\nfunction f \u2208 C0 (X) and, given \u03b5 > 0, set U := {x \u2208 X | |f (x)| < \u03b5}. Hence, by Theorem 11.2,\nX\\U is compact and X\\U \u2282 X\\Y .\nBy Urysohn's lemma (Theorem 11.1), there exists \u03c6 \u2208 K(X), 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1, such that \u03c6 = 1 on\nX\\U and supp(\u03c6) \u2282 X\\Y . In particular, supp(f \u03c6) \u2282 supp(\u03c6) \u2282 X\\Y and hence \u03bc(f \u03c6) = 0.\nTherefore,\n|\u03bc(f )| = |\u03bc(f ) \u2212 \u03bc(f \u03c6)| \u2264 k\u03bckkf (1 \u2212 \u03c6)k \u2264 k\u03bck\u03b5,\nbecause kf (1 \u2212 \u03c6)k \u2264 \u03b5 as we now confirm. For every x \u2208 X, we have, indeed, |f (x)(1 \u2212 \u03c6(x))| = 0\nif x 6\u2208 U and, if x \u2208 U, |f (x)(1 \u2212 \u03c6(x))| \u2264 |f (x)| \u2264 \u03b5. Since \u03b5 > 0 was arbitrarily chosen, we\nconclude that \u03bc(f ) = 0.\n\u0003\nWe point out that there always exists a closed subset Y of X satisfying (11.13). The smallest of\nthem is called the support of the measure \u03bc (see the references before Theorem 11.5). An important\nexample of a subset Y satisfying (11.13) is given below.\nCorollary 11.6. Let \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and consider an arbitrary family (fi )i\u2208I of positive functions in\nC0 (X) such that \u03bc(fi ) = 0 for every i \u2208 I. Then the subset\nY := {x \u2208 X | fi (x) = 0 for every i \u2208 I}\nsatisfies (11.13).\nTherefore, if f, g \u2208 C0 (X) and if\nf (x) = g(x)\n\nfor every\n\nx \u2208 Y,\n\nthen \u03bc(f ) = \u03bc(g).\nProof. Consider \u03c6 \u2208 K(X) such that\nsupp(\u03c6) \u2282 X\\Y = {x \u2208 X | there exists i \u2208 I with fi (x) > 0}.\nBy using a compactness argument, we then find a finite subset J of I such that\n[\nsupp(\u03c6) \u2282\n{x \u2208 X | fi (x) > 0}.\ni\u2208J\n\nIf we set \u03b1 := min\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\nP\nfi (x) | x \u2208 supp(\u03c6) > 0, we then obtain\n\ni\u2208J\n\n|\u03c6| \u2264\n\nk\u03c6k X\nfi\n\u03b1\ni\u2208J\n\nand hence \u03bc(f ) = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy means of the previous result, it is easy to reach the announced characterization of discrete\nRadon measures.\n\n\fF. Altomare\n\n156\n\nTheorem 11.7. Given \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X) and different points a1 , . . . , an \u2208 X, n \u2265 1, the following\nstatements are equivalent:\nn\nP\n(i) There exist \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 [0, +\u221e[ such that \u03bc =\n\u03bbi \u03b4ai (see (11.5));\ni=1\n\n(ii) if \u03c6 \u2208 K(X) and supp(\u03c6) \u2229 {a1 , . . . , an } = \u2205, then \u03bc(\u03c6) = 0;\n\n(iii) for every x \u2208 X\\{a1 , . . . , an } there exists f \u2208 C0 (X), f \u2265 0, such that f (x) > 0, f (ai ) = 0\nfor each i = 1, . . . , n, and \u03bc(f ) = 0.\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii). It is obvious.\n(ii)\u21d2(iii). If x \u2208 X\\{a1 , . . . , an }, by Urysohn's lemma, we can choose \u03c6 \u2208 K(X), 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1,\nsuch that \u03c6(x) = 1 and supp(\u03c6) \u2282 X\\{a1 , . . . , an } so that \u03bc(f ) = 0.\n(iii)\u21d2(ii). Consider \u03c6 \u2208 K(X) such that supp(\u03c6) \u2229 {a1 , . . . , an } = \u2205. By hypothesis, for every\nx \u2208 supp(\u03c6), there exists fx \u2208 C0 (X), fx \u2265 0, such that fx (x) > 0, fx (ai ) = 0 for every i = 1, . . . , n,\nand \u03bc(fx ) = 0.\nSince supp(\u03c6) is compact, there exist x1 , . . . , xp \u2208 supp(\u03c6) such that\nsupp(\u03c6) \u2282\n\np\n[\n\n{x \u2208 X | fxk (x) > 0}.\n\nk=1\n\nTherefore, the function f :=\n\np\nP\n\nk=1\n\nfxk \u2208 C0 (X) is positive, it does not vanish at any point of supp(\u03c6),\n\nand \u03bc(f ) = 0.\nIf we set m := min{f (x) | x \u2208 supp(\u03c6)} > 0, it is immediate to verify that m|\u03c6| \u2264 k\u03c6kf and\nhence \u03bc(\u03c6) = 0.\n(ii)\u21d2(i). For every j = 1, . . . , n, consider \u03c6j \u2208 K(X) such that 0 \u2264 \u03c6j \u2264 1, \u03c6j (aj ) = 1 and\n\u03c6j (ai ) = 0 for each i = 1, . . . , n, i 6= j.\nIf f \u2208 C0 (X), then\nn\nX\nf (ai )\u03c6i on {a1 , . . . , an }.\nf=\ni=1\n\nOn the other hand, the subset {a1 , . . . , an } satisfies (11.13) and hence, by Theorem 11.5,\n\u03bc(f ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nf (ai )\u03bc(\u03c6i ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi f (ai )\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03bbi := \u03bc(\u03c6i ) \u2265 0 (i = 1, . . . , n) and this completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe end the Appendix by discussing some aspects of vague convergence for Radon measures.\nFor more details, we refer, e.g., to [30, \u00a730] or to [39, Vol. I, \u00a712].\n+\nA sequence (\u03bcn )n\u22651 in M+\nb (X) is said to converge vaguely to \u03bc \u2208 Mb (X) if\nlim \u03bcn (f ) = \u03bc(f ) for every\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nf \u2208 C0 (X).\n\n(11.14)\n\nThus, (11.14) simply means that \u03bcn \u2192 \u03bc weakly in the dual space of C0 (X).\nIf, in addition, X has a countable base, then C0 (X) is separable and hence, by Banach's theorem,\nthe unit ball of the dual of C0 (X) is weakly sequentially compact. Therefore\nTheorem 11.8. If X has a countable base, then every sequence in M+\nb (X) that is bounded with\nrespect to the norm (11.2), has a subsequence that converges vaguely to some \u03bc \u2208 M+\nb (X).\n\n\fKorovkin-type theorems and positive operators\n\n157\n\nReferences\n[1] O.
