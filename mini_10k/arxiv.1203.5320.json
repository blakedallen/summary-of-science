Petreczky\nPhysics Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, USA\nAbstract. I review our current understanding of the properties of strongly\ninteracting matter at high temperatures, based upon numerical calculations in lattice\nQCD. I discuss the chiral and deconfining aspects of the QCD transition, the equation\nof state, fluctuations of conserved charges, color screening, meson correlation functions,\nand the determination of some transport coefficients.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is expected that strongly interacting matter shows qualitatively new behavior at\ntemperatures and/or densities which are comparable or larger than the typical hadronic\nscale. It has been argued by Hagedorn that production of hadronic resonances may\nlead to a limiting temperature above which hadronic matter can no longer exist [1].\nThis limiting temperature was re-interpreted by Cabibbo and Parisi as the transition\ntemperature to a new state of matter that consist of quarks [2]. Indeed, based of\nasymptotic freedom one would expect that relevant degrees of freedom at very high\ntemperatures and/or densities are quarks and gluons which are no longer subject to\nconfinement [3], i.e. deconfined. Since the quarks and gluons interact weakly at high\ntemperatures the deconfined matter is analogous to the plasmas and is also called the\nquark gluon plasma (QGP) [4]. In particular, it is characterized by color screening that\nis similar to the well-know Debye screening [5].\nThe existence of such deconfining transition was first shown using strong coupling\nexpansion in lattice QCD [6, 7], followed by numerical Monte-Carlo studies of the lattice\nSU(2) gauge theory which confirmed it [8, 9, 10]. The deconfinement of gluons was seen\nas onset of color screening [8, 9] and rapid increase in the energy density that indicate\nliberation of many new degrees of freedom [10]. The onset of color screening and rapid\nincrease in number of degrees of freedom remain the key signatures of deconfinement\neven today.\nSince these pioneering studies QCD at finite temperature became quite a large\nsub-field of lattice QCD. One of the obvious reasons for this is that the transition from\nhadronic to partonic matter cannot be described in perturbation theory. But even at\nhigh temperatures the physics is non-perturbative beyond the length scales 1/(g 2 T )\n(g 2 being the gauge coupling) [11]. Therefore lattice QCD remains the only ab-initio\ntool for theoretical understanding of the properties of strongly interacting matter under\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n2\n\nextreme condition which is important for the physics of the early universe [12, 13, 14]\nand heavy ion collisions [15].\nSymmetries play an important role in understanding the transition to QGP. For\nzero quark masses the QCD Lagrangian has an approximate chiral symmetry SUA (3)\nas well as the axial symmetry UA (1). The later is broken by quantum effects, while\nthe former is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum [16]. At high temperatures\nthe chiral symmetry is expected to be restored [17]. Therefore there should be a chiral\ntransition in QCD. The nature of the chiral transition was first discussed in Ref. [18],\nwhere it was argued that for three light quark flavors the transition should be first order,\nwhile for two flavors it could be second order belonging to the O(4) universality class.\nFurthermore, the axial symmetry is also effectively restored at high temperatures as\nthe breaking of the axial symmetry is controlled by instanton density [18] that vanishes\nat infinite temperature [17]. If the breaking of axial symmetry at the chiral transition\ntemperature is reduced the chiral transition in the two flavor theory could be first order\n[18]. I will comment on this issue in section 5.\nIn the opposite limit of infinitely heavy quark masses the QCD partition function\nhas Z(3) symmetry [9]. This symmetry is broken at high temperatures due to color\nscreening. In this case we have a deconfining transition which is first order. The\nZ(3) symmetry is a good symmetry for sufficiently large quark mass. For intermediate\nquark masses the transition is a crossover. The regions of the first order transitions\nare separated from the crossover region by lines of second order transition that belong\nthe Z(2) universality class. The region of the first order deconfinement transition was\nmapped out in Refs. [19, 20, 21]. The endpoints of this first order region correspond to\na quark masses of the order of the charm quark mass, mq \u223c 1.4GeV [19, 20].\nThe boundary of the first order chiral transition was studied using effective models,\nsee Refs. [22, 23] for recent works (also references therein). It was found that for\nthree degenerate quark flavors the endpoint of the region where the transition is first\norder corresponds to a pseudo-scalar meson mass of (110 \u00b1 40)MeV. There is no direct\nevidence for the first order chiral transition for three very light quark flavors so far in\nlattice QCD. This maybe due to lattice artifacts. The existing calculations that use\nstaggered fermion formulation give only an upper bound for the pseudo-scalar meson\nmass smaller than 70MeV [24, 25, 26], which is not inconsistent with effective model\nanalysis mentioned above. The end-point of the first order transition, or in more general\ncase the line that separates the first order transition from the crossover region belongs\nto the Z(2) universality class. This also means that for some value of the strange quark\nmass, mTs CP we have a tricritical point that connects Z(2) and O(4) lines as well as the\nfirst order region. Calculations in linear sigma model suggest that mTs CP corresponds\nto the kaon mass of about (1700 \u2212 1850)MeV [23]. On the other hand, as we will see,\nlattice QCD calculations indicate a much smaller value of mTs CP . The above picture\nof the finite temperature QCD transition is summarized in Fig. 1 (also known as the\nColumbia plot).\nFor the physical quark masses the transition is likely to be an analytic crossover [27]\n\n\f8\n\nLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\nms\n\n1st\n\nphysical point ?\n\norder\n\nmPS~~ 3.0GeV\n\nos\ncr\n\n2nd order\n\nZ(2)\n~\n~ 90MeV\n\n3\n\nve\n\nso\nr\n\nO(4)\nmTCP\ns\n\nmcPS\n\nZ(2)\n1st\n\n~\n~ 70MeV\n\n0\n\n~\n~ 5MeV\n\n8\n\nmu,d\n\norder\n\nFigure 1. The QCD transition as function of the quark masses.\n\n(for earlier works see Refs. [28, 29] ). Therefore, the discussion of the deconfinement and\nthe chiral aspects of the QCD transition at finite temperature and the determination\nof the corresponding temperature requires a special care. In fact, it is only the chiral\naspects of the transition that allow a determination of the corresponding transition\ntemperature. In sections 3 and 4 I discuss the deconfinement aspects of the QCD\ntransition in terms of chromo-electric screening and fluctuations of conserved charges.\nThe chiral aspects of the QCD transition and the determination of the corresponding\ntransition temperature are then discussed in section 5. Equation of state is one of the\nmost important characteristic of hot strongly interacting medium. It will be discussed in\nsection 5. Further insight into the properties of medium can be gained by studying meson\ncorrelation functions and spectral functions. They are also important for heavy ion\nphenomenology. Therefore section 7 is dedicated to the discussion of meson correlation\nfunctions and spectral functions. In the next section I will review some basic information\non lattice QCD calculations which is relevant for the present discussions.\n2. Basics of lattice QCD\nTo study QCD non-perturbatively we use lattice gauge theory [30]. In this formalism\na field theory is defined in a gauge-invariant way on a discrete space-time domain.\nThis serves at least two purposes: a) to provide an ultra-violet cut-off for the theory,\nrestricting highest momentum to \u03c0/a (a being the lattice spacing), and b) to evaluate the\npath integrals in the Euclidean formulation stochastically using importance sampling.\nOn the lattice the fundamental degrees of freedom of a theory with local SU(3)\ngauge symmetry are fermion fields \u03c8x that reside on the sites of the lattice and carry\nflavor, color and Dirac indeces, which we suppress through the most of this paper, and\nbosonic, gauge degrees of freedom that in the form of SU(3) matrices Ux,\u03bc reside on\nlinks. Sites on a four-dimensional lattice are labeled with x \u2261 (\u03c4, ~x). The link variables\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n4\n\nare related to the usual gauge fields: Ux,\u03bc = exp(igaA\u03bc (x)), where a is the lattice spacing\nand g is the gauge coupling.\nThe theory is defined by the partition function\nZ=\nwhere the action\n\nZ\n\nDUD \u03c8\u0304D\u03c8 exp(\u2212S)\n\n(1)\n\nS = Sg + Sf\n\n(2)\n\ncontains gauge, Sg and fermionic, Sf parts. The latter part is bi-linear in fields and has\nthe form\nSf =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u0304q Dq \u03c8q\n\n(3)\n\nq\n\nwhere Dq = D + mq is the fermion matrix and the sum goes over the quark flavors. In\nthe simplest formulation the lattice gauge action can be written as\n\u0013\nX \u0012\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(4)\n1 \u2212 Re Tr Ux,\u03bc Ux+\u03bc\u0302,\u03bd Ux+\u03bd\u0302,\u03bc Ux,\u03bd ,\nSg = \u03b2\n3\nx,\u03bc<\u03bd\n\u03b2 = 6/g 2 with g 2 being the bare gauge coupling. This is the Wilson gauge action [30].\nIt is easy to see that expanding the link variables in a the above expression gives the\nP\na 2\n) up to corrections that are suppressed as\nwell known Yang-Mills action x a4 1/4(F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\na . Thus calculations with Wilson gauge action have discretization errors of order a2 .\nThese discretization errors can be removed by the Symanzik improvement program that\nrelies on higher order difference scheme, i.e. considering combination of link variables\nthat extend beyond the elementary square [31].\nTh expectation value of an operator \u00d4 is then given by\nZ\n1\nDUD \u03c8\u0304D\u03c8 \u00d4 exp(\u2212S).\n(5)\nh\u00d4i =\nZ\nIntegration over the fermion fields (which are Grasmann variables) can be carried out\nexplicitly:\nZ=\n\nZ\n\nDU (det Dq [U])nf exp(\u2212Sg ) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nDU exp(\u2212Sef f ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Sef f = Sg \u2212 nf ln det Dq [U] is the effective action. The fermion determinant\ndet Dq [U] describes the vacuum polarization effects due to the dynamical quarks and\nmakes the effective action non-local in gauge variables. For this reason simulations\nwith dynamical quarks are very resource demanding and the quenched approximation\nis often employed, where det Dq [U] is set to 1. This approximation will be relevant for\nthe discussion of the meson spectral functions.\nThe most commonly used fermion formulations include : the Wilson fermion\nformulation, staggered fermion formulation [32] and the domain wall fermion (DWF)\nformulation [33, 34, 35]. The Wilson formulation breaks the chiral symmetry of the QCD\nLagrangian. As the result quark masses acquire an additive renormalization which makes\nthe calculations quite complicated and numerically expensive. The domain wall fermions\npreserve all the symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian at a price on introducing the extra\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n5\n\nfifth dimension. Therefore the computational costs associated with DWF formulation\nare proportional to the extent of the fifth dimension and are typically 30 to 100 times\nlarger than the ones with Wilson fermions. The staggered formulation describes four\nfermion flavors (also called tastes) in the continuum limit. The full UL (4) \u00d7 UR (4)\nsymmetry of the four flavor theory is reduced to US (1) \u00d7 UB (1), where US (1) is the\nsubgroup of the SUA (4) symmetry. Thus the staggered formulation preserves a part of\nthe chiral symmetry. This makes finite temperature calculations with staggered fermions\nattractive for two reasons. First, due to the remnant chiral symmetry there is no additive\nrenormalization of the quark mass. This makes staggered fermions computationally\ninexpensive. Second, the remnant chiral symmetry makes it easy to study the chiral\naspects of the finite temperature QCD transitions. To study arbitrary number of flavors\nwith the staggered fermion formulation the rooting trick is used. This amounts to\nreplacing nf in Eq. (6) with nf /4. The validity of this procedure was studied in details\nin recent years [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] though some open issues remain (see e.g. Ref.\n[38, 43] ).\nThe standard staggered fermion formulations has discretization errors of order a2 .\nThey come either from the lattice effects in the fermion dispersion relation and formally\nstart at order g 0a2 , and from the breaking of taste symmetry, which starts at order\ng 2 a2 . The former lead to large cutoff effects in the thermodynamic quantities at high\ntemperatures. The later lead to the distortion of the hadron spectrum at non-zero lattice\nspacing. In particular, out of 16 pseudo-scalar meson masses only one vanishes in the\nzero quark mass limit. The remaining 15 pseudo-scalar meson have masses proportional\nto a ( the squared mass of these mesons goes like g 2 a2 for sufficiently small lattice\nspacings) and thus vanish only in the continuum limit. These discretization errors can\nbe eliminated by Symanzik improvement program. Using 3-link terms in the lattice\nDirac operator one can eliminate tree level a2 errors and largely reduce cutoff effects in\nthermodynamics quantities [44]. Such improvement of the staggered fermion formulation\nis mandatory to control discretization effects at high temperature [44]. To reduce errors\ndue to taste symmetry breaking so-called fat links are used. These are combinations of\nthe usual link Ux,\u03bc and products of links along different paths. One of the possibilities\nis to construct fat links by using APE smearing [45]: a link variable Ux,\u03bc is replaced by\na weighted average of itself and a sum of the 3-link paths connecting the same sites as\nUx,\u03bc :\n\u2032\nUx,\u03bc \u2192 Ux,\u03bc\n= (1 \u2212 6c)Ux,\u03bc + c\n\nX\n\n\u2020\nUx,\u03bc Ux+\u03bd\u0302,\u03bc Ux+\u03bc\u0302,\u03bd\n.\n\n(7)\n\n\u03bd6=\u03bc\n\nHere c is a weight factor, 0 < c < 1. More complicated paths can be used as well.\nIn particular, using combination of different paths up to length seven it is possible to\neliminate taste breaking effects up to order g 2 a2 [46]. The fat links described above\nare not elements of the gauge group SU(3). While this is not a problem in principle,\nit tuns out that projecting the fat links to elements of SU(3) or U(3) gauge group\nfurther reduces the breaking of taste symmetry [47, 48, 49]. The staggered fermion\nactions that used in large numerical calculations take certain combination of fat links\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n6\n\nand improvement of the quark dispersion relation and go under acronym p4, asqtad and\nHISQ/tree. In HISQ/tree action the fat links are projected to U(3) [50]. The stout\naction used by Budapest-Wuppertal collaboration only includes fat links [51, 52, 27, 53].\nTo evaluate the path integral (5) stochastically, an ensemble of NU gauge\nconfigurations, weighted with exp(\u2212Sef f ), is generated using Monte Carlo methods.\nThe state of the art Monte-Carlo algorithm that can handle arbitrary number of quark\nflavors and most often used in QCD thermodynamics goes under the name of the rational\nhybrid Monte-Carlo (RHMC) algorithm [54]. The expectation value of the operator is\nthen approximated by the ensemble average:\nNU\n1 X\nOi (U),\nh\u00d4i \u2243\nNU i=1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Oi (U) is the value of the operator \u00d4, calculated on i-th configuration. This\nmethod works as long as Sef f is real. When quark chemical potentials are included,\ne.g. as in calculations at non-zero net baryon density, Sf and Sef f become complex and\nMonte-Carlo methods do not work. This is the well known sign problem.\nAll the quantities calculated in lattice simulations are dimensionless, i.e. are\ncalculated in units of the lattice spacing a. The lattice spacing is varied by varying\nthe lattice gauge coupling \u03b2 \u223c 1/g 2. To set the scale in lattice simulations we need to\ncalculate a given quantity and assume that it has the known physical value. Different\nchoices are possible and the lattice spacing determined by different quantities should\nbe the same up to discretization errors that vanish when the continuum limit is taken.\nCommon choices used in the literature are the scale parameters r0 and r1 determined\nby the static quark anti-quark potential V (r):\ndV\ndV\n|r=r0 = 1.65, r 2\n|r=r1 = 1.00\n(9)\ndr\ndr\nSince the static quark anti-quark potential cannot be measured experimentally the\nvalue of the parameters r0 and r1 in physical units in the continuum should be\ndetermined using some other experimentally measured quantity. The most precise\ndetermination of r1 comes from using the pion decay constant f\u03c0 as an input, which gives\nr1 = 0.3106(20)fm [55]. Furthermore, studying the shape of the static potential from\nthe above value of r1 one can obtain the value of r0 = 0.468(4)fm [56]. Alternatively one\ncan use fK to set the lattice spacing. While this procedure is more straightforward, for\nthe staggered fermion formulation it is also more problematic as one expects that due\nto taste symmetry breaking fK has larger discretization errors than the static potential.\nThe above discussion referred to the zero temperature case. To consider the case\nof non-zero temperature, T the Euclidean time extent has to be 1/T and periodic and\nanti-periodic boundary condition have to be imposed on the boson and fermion fields\n[57]. Thus the temperature is related to the lattice spacing and the temporal extent\nof the lattice, T = 1/(N\u03c4 a). Taking the continuum limit at fixed temperature implies\nN\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e while keeping the aspect ratio N\u03c3 /N\u03c4 fixed, where N\u03c3 is the spatial extent of\nthe lattice.\nr2\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n7\n\n3. Deconfinement : color screening\n3.1. Color electric screening and order parameter for deconfinement\nAs discussed in the introduction the deconfining transition in SU(N) gauge theories\nis a true phase transition related to Z(N) symmetry \u2021. The order parameters of this\nphase transition are the expectation value of the Polyakov loop and the Polyakov loop\ncorrelator\nNY\n\u03c4 \u22121\n1\nU0 (\u03c4, ~x),\n(10)\nTrW (~x)i, W (~x) =\nN\n\u03c4 =0\n1\nCP L (r, T ) = 2 hTrW (r)TrW (0)i.\n(11)\nN\nThe Polyakov loop transforms non-trivially under Z(N) transformation and the\nexpectation value of the Polyakov loop is zero in the confined phase and non-zero above\nthe transition temperature. The correlation function of the Polyakov loop is related\nto the free energy of a static quark anti-quark pair [9]. The qualitative change in the\nbehavior of the Polyakov loop and its correlator above the phase transition temperature\nis related to color screening. As it was pointed out already in Ref. [9] the Polyakov\nloop and the Polyakov loop correlator require renormalization to be interpreted as the\nfree energy of an isolated static quark or the free energy of a static quark anti-quark\n(QQ\u0304) pair. More precisely, they are related to the free energy difference of a system\nwith static QQ\u0304 pair at some temperature and the system without QQ\u0304 pair at the same\ntemperature. Since in the zero temperature limit the free energy of a static quark antiquark pair should coincide with the static potential the Polyakov loop renormalization\nis determined by the normalization constant of the static potential, namely\n\nL(T )\n\n=h\n\nLren (T )\n\n= exp(\u2212c/(2T ))L(T ) = exp(\u2212F\u221e (T )/(2T ))\n\nCP L (r, T ) = exp(\u2212F (r, T )/T + c/T ), F\u221e (T ) = lim F (r, T ),\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere c is an additive normalization that ensures that the static potential has a certain\nvalue at a given distance. In the above expressions we made explicit that the free\nenergy of an isolated static quark anti-quark pair is half the free energy of QQ\u0304 pair\nat infinite separation. In the confined phase the free energy of a static quark antiquark pair is proportional to \u03c3(T )r at large distances r, as expected. The effective\ntemperature dependent string tension \u03c3(T ) is non-zero below the phase transition\ntemperature [61, 62]. Consequently the free energy of an isolated static quark is infinity\nand Lren (T ) = 0. In the deconfined phase F\u221e (T ) is finite due to color screening. In\nparticular at high temperatures F\u221e = \u22124\u03b1s mD /3 at leading order, where mD = gT\nis the leading order Debye mass. Here and in what follows we consider only the case\nN = 3. The next-to-leading order correction for F\u221e has been calculated in Refs. [63, 64]\n\u2021 The deconfinement transition for other gauge groups have been discussed in Refs.[58, 59, 60].\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n8\n\nand was found to be small. For the free energy of a static QQ\u0304 pair at distance r we\nhave [65]\n1 \u03b1s2\nexp(\u22122mD r).\n(14)\n9 r2\nThis result is in contrast to the free energy of static charges in QED which is\n\u2212\u03b1 exp(\u2212mD r)/r, and is the consequence of non-Abelian nature of interactions. A\nstatic quark anti-quark pair could be either in a singlet or in an octet state, and thus\n(in a fixed gauge) one can define the so-called color singlet and octet free energy [65, 66]\n\u00a7\n1\n(15)\nexp(\u2212F1 (r, T )/T + c/T ) = hTr[L\u2020 (x)L(y)]i,\n3\n1\nexp(\u2212F8 (r, T )/T + c/T ) = hTrL\u2020 (x)TrL(y)i\n8\nh\ni\n1\nhTr L\u2020 (x)L(y) i.\n(16)\n\u2212\n24\nThen the Polyakov loop correlator can be written as the thermal average over the singlet\nand the octet contributions [9, 65, 66]\n1\n8\nCP L (r, T ) = exp(\u2212F1 (r, T )/T + c/T ) + exp(\u2212F8 (r, T )/T + c/T ).(17)\n9\n9\nThe singlet and octet free energies can be calculated at high temperature in leading\norder HTL approximation [71], resulting in\n4\u03b1s mD\n4 \u03b1s\nexp(\u2212mD r) \u2212\n,\n(18)\nF1 (r, T ) = \u2212\n3 r\n3\n1 \u03b1s\n4\u03b1s mD\nFa (r, T ) =\nexp(\u2212mD r) \u2212\n.\n(19)\n6 r\n3\nThe singlet and octet free energies are gauge independent at this order. Inserting the\nabove expressions into Eq. (17) and expanding in \u03b1s one can see that the leading order\ncontributions from the singlet and octet channels cancel each other and one recovers\nthe leading order result for F (r, T ) in Eq. (17). It was not clear how to generalize the\ndecomposition of the free energy into the singlet and octet contributions beyond leading\norder. Recently using the effective theory approach, namely the potential non-relativistic\nQCD (pNRQCD) at finite temperature [72, 73] it was shown that this decomposition\nindeed holds at short distances [64]. As we will see below the singlet free energy turns\nout to be useful when studying screening numerically in the lattice calculations.\nThe QCD partition function does not have the Z(3) symmetry. This symmetry\nis broken by the quark contribution. In physical terms this means that a static quark\nanti-quark pair can be screened already in the vacuum by light dynamical quarks. The\nfree energy does not rise linearly with distance but saturates at some distance, i.e.\nF (r, T ) = \u2212\n\n\u00a7 The terms color singlet free energy and octet free energy are misleading as only F (r, T ) has the\nmeaning of the free energy of static quark anti-quark pair. Furthermore, at low temperatures both\nF1 and F8 are determined by color singlet asymptotic states [67]. The color screening of static quark\nquark interaction was discussed in Ref. [68], while color screening of charges in higher representations\nwas studied in Refs. [69, 70].\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n9\n\n1\n0.9\n\nLren(T)\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nHISQ/tree: N\u03c4=6\nN\u03c4=8\nN\u03c4=12\nstout, cont.\nSU(3)\nSU(2)\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nT [MeV]\n\n0\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFigure 2. The Polyakov loop as function of the temperature in 2+1 flavor QCD\n[74, 56] and in pure gauge theory [62, 75].\n\nwe see string breaking. For light dynamical quarks the corresponding free energy F\u221e\nis twice the binding energy of static-light meson and thus is proportional to \u039bQCD .\nTherefore, the Polyakov loop is expected to be O(1) in the transition region. At very\nhigh temperatures, however, the screening in the QCD and purely gluonic plasma is\nexpected to be similar. The above discussion of the free energy of static quark antiquark pair still holds and\nq the only difference is in the value of the Debye mass, which\nnow becomes mD = gT 1 + Nf /6. Here Nf being the number of light quark flavors,\ni.e. Nf = 3.\nIn Fig. 2 I show the recent lattice results for the renormalized Polyakov loop\nin 2+1 flavor QCD with physical quark masses [74] compared to the results in pure\ngluodynamics [62, 75]. The temperature scale in pure gauge theory was set using the\n\u221a\nvalue \u03c3 = 465.2MeV for the zero temperature string tension. We see a relative smooth\nincrease in the Polyakov loop in 2+1 flavor QCD starting at temperatures of about\n160MeV. Earlier results for the renormalized Polyakov loop in 2 and 3 flavor QCD with\nsignificantly heavier quark masses have been reported in Refs. [76, 77] The behavior of\nthe Polyakov loop in pure glue theory and full QCD is quite different in the transition\nregion, while at high temperatures it is qualitatively similar.\nThe free energy of a static QQ\u0304 pair as well as the singlet free energy was calculated\nusing p4 action on 163 \u00d7 4 and 243 \u00d7 6 lattices for almost physical light quark\nmasses, namely ml = ms /10 [78, 79]. There are also calculations with Wilson fermion\nformulation with much heavier quark masses [80] as well as preliminary results for the\nstout action [81]. Qualitatively these results are similar to the ones obtained with p4\naction. A very detailed calculation of the free energy of QQ\u0304 pair in pure glue theory\nwas presented in Refs. [61, 62, 82], while the singlet free energy in Coulomb gauge was\nstudied in Refs. [75, 83].\nIn Fig. 3 I show the numerical results for the free energy and the singlet free energy\nobtained with p4 action on 163 \u00d7 4 lattice. At low temperatures the qualitative behavior\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n10\n\nof the free energy and singlet free energy is similar. The singlet free energy agrees with\nthe zero temperature potential shown in the figure as the black line, while the free energy\ndiffers from it by the trivial color factor T ln 9. At high temperatures the free energy\nand the singlet free energy show very different behavior, in particular the temperature\ndependence is much stronger in F (r, T ). The singlet free energy agrees with the zero\ntemperature potential at short distances, while this is not the case for the free energy\neven when the factor T ln 9 is taken into account. This behavior of the QQ\u0304 free energy\nat high temperatures is consistent with the partial cancellation of the color singlet and\ncolor octet contributions as described above. Similar difference between the free energy\nand singlet free energy have been observed in the pure glue theory [61, 75, 82].\nColor screening means that r(F1 (r, T )\u2212F\u221e (T )) as well as r(F (r, T )\u2212F\u221e (T )) should\ndecay exponentially at large distances. Therefore in Fig. 4 I show these combinations.\nAt distance rT > 0.8 we indeed see the expected exponential falloff. Fitting the lattice\ndata for r(F1 (r, T ) \u2212 F\u221e (T )) to an exponential one can determine the Debye mass nonperturbatively. This was done for pure glue theory and 2+1 flavor QCD. It turns out\nthat the temperature dependence of the Debye mass is well described by the leading\norder result but its value is about factor 1.4 larger both in pure glue theory and 2+1\nflavor QCD [79] k. This means that the dependence of the Debye mass on quark flavors\nis well described by perturbation theory. The Debye mass is non-perturbative beyond\nleading order [84, 85]. The non-perturbative enhancement of the Debye mass over the\nleading order result is expected based on the gap equation calculation of the Debye mass\n[86].\n1\n\n1\n\nF(r,T) [GeV]\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nF1(r,T) [GeV]\n\n0.4\nT [MeV]\n175\n189\n200\n217\n234\n338\n421\n546\n686\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\nr [fm]\n\n-0.8\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\nr [fm]\n\n-0.8\n1.5\n\n2\n\nT [MeV]\n175\n189\n200\n217\n234\n338\n421\n546\n686\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 3.

Calculations in SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories show\nno gauge dependence of the extracted Debye mass within statistical errors [92, 93]. The\nextracted screening masses are in agreement with the ones obtained from the singlet\nfree energy\n3.2. Color magnetic screening and dimensional reduction\nContrary to ordinary plasmas that have no magnetic screening the static chromomagnetic fields are screened in QGP. This is due to the fact that unlike photons gluons\ninteract with each other (the stress tensor is non-linear in QCD). Magnetic screening is\nnon-perturbative, i.e. it does not appear at any finite order of pertubation theory and is\nneeded to cure the infrared divergences of the pressure rendering it finite but also nonperturbative at order g 6 [11]. In analogy with electric screening magnetic screening can\nbe studied using gauge fixed magnetic gluon propagators. However, the large distance\nbehavior of the magnetic propagators is more complex and much more susceptible to\nfinite volume effects. In Landau type gauges as well as in Coulomb gauge the magnetic\npropagator shows oscillating behavior instead of decaying exponentially [95]. Thus no\nmagnetic mass can be defined. However, one can define a common exponentially falling\nenvelope for different gauges that then gives a screening mass of about 0.5g 2 T [95].\nA magnetic mass of similar size was found in analytic approach of Refs. [96, 97, 98].\nThus the corresponding effective magnetic screening length is larger than the electric\nscreening length as one would expect for weakly coupled QGP \u00b6.\nSpatial Wilson loops can also be used to define a length scale associated with\nstatic magnetic fields. They obey area law at any temperature governed by spatial\nstring tension \u03c3s (T ). The numerical results for the spatial string tension calculated\nin 2+1 flavor QCD with p4 action and ml = ms /10 are shown in Fig. 5.

The uncertainty in the prediction of the dimensionally reduced theory is show by\ndashed lines.\n\ntemperatures q\n\u03c3s (T ) coincides with the zero temperature string tension, while at high\ntemperatures \u03c3s (T ) \u223c T . This behavior can be understood in terms of dimensionally\nreduced effective theory. At high temperatures there is a separation of different scales\n2\u03c0T \u226b mD \u226b g 2T . If we integrate out the modes associated with the scale 2\u03c0T the\nthermodynamics and the screening lengths can be described in terms of an effective\nfield theory, which at the lowest order is the 3 dimensional adjoint Higgs model in the\nconfined phase [100, 101, 102]\nZ\n1\nE\nS3 = d3 x 2 Tr Fij (x) Fij (x) + Tr [Di , A0 (x)]2\ng3\n2\n+ mD Tr A0 (x)2 + \u03bbA (Tr A0 (x)2 )2 .\n(20)\nThe static electric fields become adjoint scalars in the three dimensional effective theory.\nThe couplings of the effective theory can be calculated in perturbation theory at any\norder [101, 102]. The spatial string tension should be identified with the string tension\nof this effective three dimensional theory \u03c33 . The gauge coupling constant in three\ndimensions g32 has the dimension of the mass, and at the lowest order (tree level )\ng32 = g 2 T . On dimensional grounds \u03c33 = cg32 with c being a constant. This explains the\nlinear rise of the string tension at high temperatures. The coefficient c was calculated\nin the three dimensional adjoint Higgs model [103, 104]. The three dimensional gauge\ng3 coupling was calculated to 2-loop [105]. Combining this with the known value of c\nwe get the weak coupling prediction for the spatial string tension which is compared\nwith the lattice data in Fig. 5. Quite surprisingly, the weak coupling result for the\nspatial string tension works well down temperatures of 200MeV, where the effective\nfield theoryqis not supposed to work. Note that in the conformal strongly coupled gauge\ntheory T / \u03c3s (T ) \u223c 1/\u03bb1/4 (see e.g. Ref. [106] and references therein). Thus the\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n13\n\nq\n\nratio T / \u03c3s (T ) is temperature independent and vanishes in the limit of infinite t'Hooft\ncoupling, \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. This is in sharp contrast with lattice calculations. To deal with\nthis problem one can modify the AdS metric to break the conformal invariance and\nget a QCD-like theory. This approach is known as AdS/QCD. Attempts to model the\ntemperature dependence of the spatial string tension using AdS/QCD were discussed\nin Ref. [107, 108, 109].\n3.3. The spectrum of gauge invariant screening masses\nThere are several screening masses that can be studied in the framework of the 3\ndimensional effective theory [110, 111, 112, 103, 104] as well as in the original four\ndimensional theory [113, 114, 115, 62]. Comparison of the screening masses calculated in\nthese two theories can provide information on the validity of the dimensionally reduced\neffective theory. The screening masses can be classified according to J P R quantum\nnumbers. Here R is the analog of C-parity. It is related to the symmetry with respect\nto the following transformation of the static electric field, A0 \u2192 \u2212A0 . All the operators\ntransform trivially under charge conjugation in the adjoint Higgs model [103]. In the 0++\nchannel there are two distinct screening masses: screening mass m(A20 ) corresponding\nto the \"electric\" correlator of TrA20 , and the screening mass mG corresponding to the\n\"magnetic\" correlator TrFij2 . These correlators can mix but this mixing is suppressed\nfor weak coupling. The lightest screening mass mE in the 0\u2212\u2212 channel was proposed\nas the non-perturbative definition of the Debye mass [116] since the negative R parity\nprevents mixing with the magnetic sector. For asymptotically small couplings we expect\nmG < mE < m(A20 ) and the large distance behavior of the Polyakov loop correlators is\nactually governed by the \"magnetic\" screening mass mG [116, 117]. For the interesting\ntemperature range, however, m(A20 ) turns out to be the smallest and mG turns out to be\nthe largest of the above screening masses [103, 104]. Furtheremore, there is almost no\nmixing between the \"electric\" and \"magnetic\" correlators in the 0++ channel [103, 104].\nThus the long distance behavior of the Polyakov loop is determined by the screening\nmass corresponding to TrA20 correlator ( see also discussion in Ref. [117]). In Fig. 6 I\nshow the screening masses extracted from the Polyakov loop correlators in SU(2) and\nSU(3) gauge theories and compared to the corresponding screening masses calculated in\nthe effective three dimensional theory. There is fairly good agreement with the screening\nmasses calculated in the full theory and in the effective theory.\nThe lightest screening mass in the 0++ channel was calculated in perturbation\ntheory at next-to-leading order [118] and the corresponding result is also shown in\nthe figure. The next-to-leading order result significantly overestimates the screening\nmasses, while the leading order result seems to work fine. The next-to-leading order\ncalculations also explains to some extent why the screening mass in the TrA20 channel\nis the smallest [118]. An interesting observation has been made in Ref. [115], where\nscreening masses corresponding to the correlators of the real and imaginary parts of the\nPolyakov loop have been calculated. In terms of the effective 3d theory these correlators\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n5.5\n\n14\n5.5\n\n3d\n\n5\n\n3d\nKaczmarek et al\nDatta-Gupta\n\n5\n\n4.5\n\n4.5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nT/Tc\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nT/Tc\n\n0\n5.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 6.

Deconfinement : Fluctuations of conserved charges\nAs mentioned before due to the infamous sign problem lattice QCD Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are not possible at non-zero quark chemical potentials. However, the\npressure at non-zero chemical potentials can be evaluated using Taylor expansion. The\nTaylor expansion can be set up in terms of the quark chemical potentials \u03bcu , \u03bcd and\n\u03bcs , or in terms of the chemical potentials corresponding to baryon number B, electric\ncharge Q and strangeness S of hadrons\n\u0012 \u0013i \u0012 \u0013i \u0012 \u0013j\nX 1\n1\n\u03bcu\n\u03bcd\np\nuds \u03bcu\n=\nln Z(T, \u03bcu , \u03bcd, \u03bcs ) =\n\u03c7ijk\n(21)\n4\n3\nT\nVT\nT\nT\nT\nijk i!j!k!\n\u2202 i+j+k p/T 4\n(22)\n\u2202(\u03bcu /T )i \u2202(\u03bcd /T )j \u2202(\u03bcs /T )k\n\u0012 \u0013i \u0012 \u0013i \u0012 \u0013j\nX 1\n1\n\u03bcu\n\u03bcd\nuds \u03bcu\n=\nln\nZ(T,\n\u03bc\n,\n\u03bc\n,\n\u03bc\n)\n=\n\u03c7\n(23)\nB\nS\nQ\nijk\n3\nVT\nT\nT\nT\nijk i!j!k!\n\n\u03c7uds\nijk =\np\nT4\n\n\u2202 i+j+k p/T 4\n.\n(24)\n\u2202(\u03bcB /T )i \u2202(\u03bcQ /T )j \u2202(\u03bcS /T )k\nWhile Taylor expansion can be used to study the physics at non-zero baryon density\nthe expansion coefficients are interesting on their own right as they are related to the\nfluctuations and correlations of conserved charges.

This is because fluctuation of conserved charges are sensitive to the\nunderlying degrees of freedom which could be hadronic or partonic. Fluctuations of\nconserved charges have been studied using different staggered actions [28, 56, 74, 120,\n121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128]. As an example in Fig. 7 I show the quadratic\nstrangeness fluctuation as the function of the temperature calculated with HISQ/tree\nand stout actions. Fluctuations are suppressed at low temperatures because conserved\ncharges are carried by massive strange hadrons (mostly kaons). They are well described\nby Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model at low temperatures. Strangeness fluctuations\nrapidly grow in the transition region of T = (160 \u2212 200) MeV as consequence of\ndeconfinement. At temperatures T > 250 MeV strangeness fluctuations are close to\nunity that corresponds to the massless ideal quark gas. Similar picture can seen in\nother fluctuations, in particular for light quark number fluctuation, \u03c7l , which is also\nshown in Fig. 7. The more rapid rise of \u03c7l in the transition region is a quark mass\neffect. In fact, similar quark mass dependence is seen in the HRG model. At high\n\n\u03c7B\n=\n2\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n16\n\ntemperatures the strange quark mass plays little role. In fact the difference between\nthe strange and the light quark number susceptibilities is zero within errors. There is a\ngood agreement between the calculations performed with stout and HISQ/tree action\nas the continuum limit is approached. Let me finally note that strangeness fluctuations\nhave been calculated very recently with Wilson action for the physical values of the\nquark masses, and these calculations confirm the staggered result [129].\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n\u03c7s\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nHISQ/tree: N\u03c4=6\nN\u03c4=8\nN\u03c4=12\nstout, cont.\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\u03c7l\n\nHISQ/tree: N\u03c4=6\nN\u03c4=8\nN\u03c4=12\nstout, cont.\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\nT [MeV]\n\nT [MeV]\n\n0\n\n0\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nFigure 7.

Quark number correlation \u03c7us\n11 (left) and CBS (right) calculated with stout\n[127] and HISQ/tree actions [126, 128]. The lattice results are compared with the\nprediction of the HRG model shown as a black line.\n\nCorrelations of conserved charges, in particular quark number correlations are\nalso sensitive to the relevant degrees of freedom. At infinitely high temperatures the\ncorrelations between different quark numbers should vanish due to the weakly interacting\nnature of QGP. In the high temperature region quark number correlations have been\ncalculated in perturbation theory [130, 131, 132] and in the framework of dimensionally\nreduced effective theory [133]. The deviation from the ideal gas limit turned out to be\nquite small. At low temperatures, where hadrons are the relevant degrees of freedom\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n17\n\nsuch correlations naturally arise as different quark flavors are bound in hadrons. In Fig.\n8 I show the results of the lattice calculations performed with stout and HISQ/tree\naction for \u03c7us\n11 . These results demonstrate the expected features: at high temperatures\nthe correlations are very small while at low temperatures they are compatible with\nHRG results. The fact that \u03c7us\n11 has a minimum is due to interplay between meson and\nbaryon contributions. Mesons and baryons contribute to \u03c7us\n11 with opposite signs. At low\ntemperatures the negative contribution from mesons dominates \u03c7us\n11 . As the temperature\nincreases baryon contribution becomes significant and eventually the dominant one\nbecause of the larger density of states in the excited baryon sector. It is also interesting\nto consider the following combination\nds\n\u03c7us\n11 + \u03c711\n,\n(30)\n\u03c7s2\nthat was first introduced in Ref.[134]. The Boltzmann suppression at low temperature\nis canceled out in this combination and at high temperatures it should approach one.\nThe lattice results obtained with stout and HISQ/tree actions are also shown in Fig. 8.\nAgain, at low temperatures the lattice results are well described by HRG model, while\nat high temperatures CBS is close to one as expected for weakly interacting quarks.\nHigher order expansion coefficients have been studied in detail for p4 action and\nlight quark mass ml = 0.1ms [121]. In Fig. 9 I show the fourth and sixth order\nfluctuations of the electric charge. The forth order coefficient develops a peak in the\ntransition region and at high temperatures approaches the ideal quark gas value. The\nsixth order expansion coefficient has a peak around the transition temperature and\nbecomes negative above the transition temperature. It approaches zero from below as\nthe temperature increases as expected in the weakly interacting QGP. The six order\nexpansion coefficient vanishes in the ideal gas limit as well as in the next order of\nperturbation theory [130]. Based on the discussion discussion of the second order\nexpansion coefficients we would expect that at low temperatures also the higher order\nexpansion coefficients should be reasonably well described by HRG. However, this is not\nthe case. As one can see from Fig. 9 the lattice results fall below the HRG prediction.\nThis is due to the large cutoff effects related to taste symmetry breaking in the p4\naction. Taste symmetry breaking effects lead to distortions of the hadron spectrum.\nIf these distortions are taken into account in the HRG calculations a good agreement\nwith the lattice data can be achieved [135, 136, 137]. The HRG model predictions with\nthe distorted spectrum are shown in Fig. 9 as the dashed and dotted lines and are in\nreasonably good agreement with the lattice data. Preliminary results for the higher\norder expansion coefficients have been recently obtained with HISQ/tree action [124].\nThe qualitative features of these expansion coefficients remain the same, however, the\nlocation of the peak is shifted to smaller temperatures. The observed shift in the peak\nposition is consistent with the shift in the chiral transition temperature observed in\nthe calculations with HISQ/tree action [56]. The higher order expansion coefficients\nare sensitive to the singular part of the free energy density in the vicinity of the chiral\ntransition temperature. Therefore I will come back to the discussion of these quantities\ns\nCBS = \u22123\u03c7BS\n11 /\u03c72 = 1 +\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n1\n\n18\n5\n\n\u03c7Q\n4\n\n4\n\n0.8\n\n3 \u03c7Q\n6\n\nN\u03c4=4\n\n2\n\n0.6\nN\u03c4=4\nN\u03c4=6\n\n0.4\n\n1\nSB\n\n0\n-1\n\n0.2\n\nSB\nT [MeV]\n\n0\n180\n\n220\n\n260\n\n-2\nT [MeV]\n\n-3\n300\n\n340\n\n180\n\n220\n\n260\n\n300\n\n340\n\nFigure 9.

While no continuum\nextrapolation was performed the numerical data suggest that at high temperatures the\nfourth order expansion coefficient will approach the ideal quark gas value from below\n[123]. In the same study charm quark number fluctuations have been considered using\npartially quenched approximation, i.e. no charm quark loops. It was found that the\nideal quark gas is a good approximation also in this case [123].\nFinally let us compared the lattice results for quark number susceptibilities at high\ntemperatures with the prediction of resummed perturation theory [130, 131]. In Fig.\n10 I show the lattice results for light quark number susceptibilities obtained with p4,\nstout and HISQ/tree actions compared with the resummed perturbative results. Since\nthe difference between light and strange quark number susceptibilities is negligible for\nT > 400MeV in the figure I also show the strange quark number susceptibilities obtained\nwith asqtad action [28]. The continuum extrapolated stout results agree well with HTL\nresummed perturbative result [130]. Whereas, the N\u03c4 = 8 asqtad results, that are\nexpected to be close to the continuum limit, agree with the results obtained using the\nnext-to-leading log (NLA) approximation [131]. Clearly more lattice calculations in the\nhigh temperature limit are requited to settle this issue. It is also interesting to compare\nthe results of the lattice calculations with the results obtained in strongly coupled gauge\ntheories using AdS/CFT correspondence. The result from AdS/CFT calculations shown\nin the figure as the solid black line is significantly below the lattice results + .\n+\n\nThe conserved charges considered in these calculations are not exactly the quark numbers, see\ndiscussion in Ref.

Chiral transition\nThe Lagrangian of QCD has an approximate SUA (3) chiral symmetry. This symmetry\nis spontaneously broken in the vacuum. The chiral symmetry breaking is signaled by\nnon-zero expectation value of the quark or chiral condensate, h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i =\n6 0 in the massless\nlimit. This symmetry is expected to be restored at high temperatures and the quark\ncondensate vanishes. There is an explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry by the small\nvalue of u, d and s quark masses. While due to the relatively large strange quark\nmass (ms \u2243 100 MeV) SUA (3) may not be a very good symmetry its subgroup SUA (2)\nremains a very good symmetry and is relevant for the discussion of the finite temperature\ntransition in QCD. If the relevant symmetry is SUA (2) the chiral transition is expected\nto be second order for massless light (u and d) quarks belonging to the O(4) universality\nclass [18]. Recent calculations with p4 action confirm this pictures [139]. In other words\nmphys\n> mTs CP , contrary to calculations in effective linear sigma model. This also\ns\nmeans that for non-zero light quark masses the transition must be a crossover. The\nlater fact seems to be supported by calculations in Ref. [27]. The UA (1) symmetry\nis explicitly broken in the vacuum by the anomaly but it is expected to be effectively\nrestored at high temperatures as the non-perturbative vacuum fluctuations responsible\nfor its breaking are suppressed at high temperatures. If the UA (1) symmetry is restored\nat the same temperature as the SUA (2) symmetry the transition could be first order\n[18]. Recent calculations with staggered as well as with domain wall fermions suggest\nthat UA (1) symmetry gets restored at temperature that is significantly higher than the\nchiral transition temperature [140, 141].\nFor massless quarks the chiral condensate vanishes at the critical temperature\n0\nTc and it is the order parameter. Therefore in the lattice studies one calculates the\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n20\n\nchiral condensate and its derivative with respect to the quark mass, called the chiral\nsusceptibility. For the staggered fermion formulation most commonly used in the lattice\ncalculations these quantities can be written as follows:\n1 1\nTrhDq\u22121 i,\n(31)\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iq,x =\n3\n4 N\u03c3 N\u03c4\n\u2202h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iq,\u03c4\n\u03c7m,q (T ) = nf\n= \u03c7q,disc + \u03c7q,con q = l, s,\n(32)\n\u2202ml\nwhere the subscript x = \u03c4 and x = 0 denote the expectation value at finite and zero\ntemperature, respectively. Furthermore, Dq = mq * 1 + D is the fermion matrix in the\ncanonical normalization and nf = 2 and 1 for light and strange quarks, respectively.\nIn Eq. (32) we made explicit that chiral susceptibility is the sum of connected and\ndisconnected Feynman diagrams. The disconnected and connected contributions can be\nwritten as\no\nn\nn2f\n\u22121 2\n\u22121 2\n,\n(33)\n\u03c7q,disc =\nh(TrD\n)\ni\n\u2212\nhTrD\ni\nq\nq\n16N\u03c33 N\u03c4\nnf X\n(34)\n\u03c7q,con = \u2212 Tr h Dq\u22121 (x, 0)Dq\u22121 (0, x) i , q = l, s.\n4\nx\nThe disconnected part of the light quark susceptibility describes the fluctuations in the\nlight quark condensate and is analogous to the fluctuations of the order parameter of\nan O(N) spin model. The second term (\u03c7q,con ) arises from the explicit quark mass\ndependence of the chiral condensate and is the expectation value of the volume integral\nof the correlation function of the taste non-singlet scalar operator \u03c8\u0304\u03c8. Let me note\nthat in the massless limit only \u03c7l,disc diverges. In the next subsections I will discuss the\ntemperature dependence of the chiral condensate and the chiral susceptibility as well as\nthe role of universal scaling in the transition region.\n5.1. The temperature dependence of the chiral condensate\nThe chiral condensate needs a multiplicative, and also an additive renormalization if\nthe quark mass is non-zero.

Interestingly, the rapid decrease\nin the subtracted chiral condensate happens at temperatures that are smaller than the\ntemperatures where the Polyakov loop rises rapidly as first noticed in Ref. [52]. On the\nother hand the rapid change in \u03c7l and h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8isub happen roughly in the same temperature\nregion. The above results for h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8isub obtained with HISQ/tree action agree well with\nthe continuum extrapolated stout results.\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n21\n1\n\nLren\n\u2212\n<\u03c8 \u03c8>sub\n\n0.8\n2\n\n\u03c7 /T\n\u2212 l\n<\u03c8 \u03c8>sub\n\n0.6\n0.6\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.4\nN\u03c4=8, fK scale\n\nN\u03c4=8, fK scale\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\nT [MeV]\n0\n120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300\n\nT [MeV]\n0\n120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300\n\nFigure 11.

The factor r14 was introduced to make the combination\ndimensionless. It is convenient to choose the normalization constant to be the light\nquark condensate for ml = 0 multiplied by ms r14 . In Fig. 12 the renormalized quark\ncondensate is shown as function of the temperature for HISQ/tree and stout actions.\nWe see a crossover behavior for temperature of (150 \u2212 160)MeV, where \u2206R\nl drops by\n50%. The difference between the stout and HISQ/tree results is a quark mass effect.\nCalculations for HISQ/tree action were performed for ml = ms /20, while the stout\ncalculations were done for the physical light quark masses, ml = ms /27.3. For a direct\ncomparison with stout results, we need to extrapolate the HISQ/tree data in the light\nquark mass and also take care of the residual cutoff dependence in the HISQ/tree data.\nThis was done in Ref. [56] and the results are shown in the figure as black diamonds\ndemonstrating a good agreement between HISQ/tree and stout results. Contrary to\nR\n\u2206R\nl the renormalized strange quark condensate \u2206s shows only a gradual decrease over\na wide temperature interval dropping by 50% only at significantly higher temperatures\nof about 190 MeV.\n5.2. The chiral susceptibility\nFor a true chiral phase transition the chiral susceptibility diverges at the transition\ntemperature. For physical value of the quark masses we expect to see a peak in the\nchiral susceptibility at a certain temperature that defines the crossover temperature. The\nchiral susceptibility also needs a multiplicative and additive renormalization.

The renormalized chiral susceptibility \u03c7R for the asqtad and HISQ/tree\nactions obtained at ml = 0.05ms and compared with the stout action results [52].

There is a fairly good agreement between the results obtained with\ndifferent actions if fK scale is used. At low temperatures the stout results are above the\nasqtad and HISQ/tree results due to quark mass effects [56].\n\u2217 In Ref. [52] the light quark mass was used instead of m in Eq. (37). In the comparison this was\ns\ntaken into account [56].\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n23\n\n5.3. O(N) scaling and the transition temperature\nAs discussed in the beginning of this section for physical ms and vanishing light quark\nmasses the transition is expected to be second order belonging to the O(4) universality\nclass in the continuum limit. At non-zero lattices spacing, however, we should expect\nO(2) universality class as only a part of the chiral symmetry is preserved in the staggered\nfermion formulation. Therefore in the following we will use the term O(N) universality\nclass as referring to either O(4) or O(2) universality class. In the vicinity of the chiral\nphase transition, the free energy density may be expressed as a sum of a singular and a\nregular part,\nT\n(38)\nf = \u2212 ln Z \u2261 fsing (t, h) + freg (T, ml , ms ) .\nV\nHere t and h are dimensionless couplings that control deviations from criticality. They\nare related to the temperature T and the light quark mass ml as\nt=\n\n1 T \u2212 Tc0\nt0 Tc0\n\n,\n\nh=\n\n1\nH\nh0\n\n,\n\nH=\n\nml\n,\nms\n\n(39)\n\nwhere Tc0 denotes the chiral phase transition temperature, i.e., the transition\ntemperature at H = 0. The scaling variables t, h are normalized by two parameters t0\nand h0 , which are unique to QCD and similar to the low energy constants in the chiral\nLagrangian. These need to be determined together with Tc0 . In the continuum limit,\nall three parameters are uniquely defined, but depend on the value of the strange quark\nmass. On the lattice they will depend on N\u03c4 as well.\nThe singular contribution to the free energy density is a homogeneous function of\nthe two variables t and h. Its invariance under scale transformations can be used to\nexpress it in terms of a single scaling variable\n1/\u03b2\u03b4\n\nz = t/h\n\n1 T \u2212 Tc0\n=\nt0 Tc0\n\nh0\nH\n\n!1/\u03b2\u03b4\n\n1 T \u2212 Tc0\n=\nz0 Tc0\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nH\n\n\u00131/\u03b2\u03b4\n\n(40)\n1/\u03b2\u03b4\n\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b4 are the critical exponents of the O(N) universality class and z0 = t0 /h0\nThus, the dimensionless free energy density f \u0303 \u2261 f /T 4 can be written as\nf \u0303(T, ml , ms ) = h1+1/\u03b4 ff (z) + freg (T, H, ms ) ,\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nwhere ff is the universal scaling function and the regular term freg gives rise to scaling\nviolations. This regular term can be expanded in a Taylor series around (t, h) = (0, 0).\nIt should be noted that the reduced temperature t may depend on other parameters\nwhich do not explicitly break chiral symmetry. In particular, it depends on light and\nstrange quark chemical potentials \u03bcq , which in leading order enter only quadratically,\n\uf8eb\n\nX\n\u03bcq\n1 T \u2212 Tc0\n+\n\u03baq\nt= \uf8ed\n0\nt0\nTc\nT\nq=l,s\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03bcl \u03bcs \uf8f8\n.\n+ \u03bals\nT T\n\n(42)\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n24\n\nThe transition temperature can be defined as peaks in the susceptibilities (response\nfunctions) that are second derivatives of the free energy density with respect to relevant\nparameters. Since there are two relevant parameters we can define three susceptibilities:\n\u2202 2 f \u0303\n\u2202 2 f \u0303\n\u2202 2 f \u0303\n, \u03c7t,l =\n, \u03c7t,t = 2 .\n(43)\n\u03c7m,l =\n\u2202m2l\n\u2202t\u2202ml\n\u2202t\nThus, three different pseudo-critical temperatures Tm,l , Tt,l and Tt,t can be defined.\nIn the vicinity of the critical point the behavior of these susceptibilities is controlled\nby three universal scaling functions that can be derived from ff . In the chiral limit\nTm,l = Tt,l = Tt,t = Tc0 . There is, however, an additional complication for O(N)\nuniversality class: while \u03c7m,l and \u03c7t,l diverge at the critical point for ml \u2192 0\n1/\u03b4\u22121\n\n\u03c7m,l \u223c ml\n\n,\n\n(\u03b2\u22121)/\u03b2\u03b4\n\n\u03c7t,l \u223c ml\n\n,\n\n(44)\n\n\u03c7t,t is finite because \u03b1 < 0 for O(N) models ( \u03c7t,t \u223c |t|\u2212\u03b1 ). Therefore, one has to\nconsider the third derivative of f \u0303 with respect to t :\n\u2202 3 f \u0303\n\u03c7t,t,t = 3 .\n(45)\n\u2202t\nIn the vicinity of the critical point the derivatives with respect to t can be estimated\nby taking the derivatives with respect to \u03bc2l , i.e. the response functions \u03c7t,l and \u03c7t,t,t\nare identical to the second Taylor expansion coefficient of the quark condensate and the\nsixth order expansion coefficient to the pressure, respectively. The former controls the\ncurvature of the transition temperature as function of the quark chemical potential \u03bcq\nand was studied for p4 action using N\u03c4 = 4 and 8 lattices [142]. The later corresponds to\nthe sixth order quark number fluctuation which is related to the deconfinement aspects\nof the transition. The fact that this quantity is sensitive to the chiral dynamics points\nto a relation between deconfining and chiral aspects of the transition. In the following\nI discuss the determination of the transition temperature defined as peak position of\n\u03c7m,l , i.e. Tc = Tm,l .\n5.4. Determination of the transition temperature\nThe O(N) scaling described in the above subsection can be used to determine the\npseudo-critical temperature of the chiral transition. For the study of the O(N) scaling\nit is convenient to consider the dimensionless order parameter\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8il\n.\n(46)\nT4\nThe subscript \"b\" refers to the fact that this is a bare quantity since the additive UV\ndivergence is not removed. From the point of view of the scaling analysis this divergent\nterm is just a regular contribution. For sufficiently small quark mass and in the vicinity\nof the transition region we can write\nMb = ms\n\nMb (T, H) = h1/\u03b4 fG (t/h1/\u03b2\u03b4 ) + fM,reg (T, H).\n\n(47)\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n25\n\nHere fG (z) is the scaling function related to ff and was calculated for O(2) and O(4)\nspin models [143, 144, 145, 146, 147]. The regular contribution can be parametrized as\n[56]\nfM,reg (T, H) = at (T )H\n\uf8eb\n\nT \u2212 Tc0\nT \u2212 Tc0\n+\na\n= \uf8eda0 + a1\n2\nTc0\nTc0\n\n!2 \uf8f6\n\uf8f8 H.\n\n(48)\n\nThen we have the following behavior for the light chiral susceptibility\n\u03c7m,l\nT2\n=\nT2\nm2s\n\n!\n\n\u2202fM,reg (T, H)\n1 1/\u03b4\u22121\nh\nf\u03c7 (z) +\n,\nh0\n\u2202H\n1\nz\nwith f\u03c7 (z) = [fG (z) \u2212 fG\u2032 (z)].\n(49)\n\u03b4\n\u03b2\nOne performs a simultaneous fit to the lattice data for Mb and \u03c7m,l treating\nTc0 , t0 , h0 , a0 , a1 and a2 as fit parameters [56]. This gives a good description of the quark\nmass and temperature dependence of \u03c7m,l and allows to determine accurately the peak\nposition in \u03c7m,l . As an example in Fig. I show the O(4) scaling fits for N\u03c4 = 8 lattice\ndata obtained with HISQ/tree action. The scaling fit works quite well. Similar results\nhave been obtained for N\u03c4 = 6 and 12 as well as for asqtad action on N\u03c4 = 8 and 12\nlattices [56]. Furthermore, scaling fits have been performed assuming O(2) universality\nclass. The quality of these fits were similar to the O(4) ones and the resulting transition\ntemperatures turned out to be the same within statistical errors [56]. Having determined\nTc for HISQ/tree and asqtad action for each N\u03c4 a combined continuum extrapolation\nwas performed using different assumption about the N\u03c4 dependence of Tc . This analysis\nresulted in [56]:\nTc = (154 \u00b1 9)MeV.\n16\n\n(50)\n\n275\n\n14\n\nHISQ/tree: N\u03c4 = 8, O(4)\n\n250\n\n12\n\n225\n\n10\n\n200\n\nMb\n8\n\nHISQ/tree: N\u03c4 = 8, O(4)\n\n\u03c7m,l / T2\n\nml / ms = 0.050\n0.037\n\nml / ms = 0.050\n0.037\n0.025\n\n6\n\n175\n150\n125\n\n4\n\n100\n\n2\n\nT [MeV]\n\nT [MeV]\n\n75\n\n0\n130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n210\n\n220\n\nFigure 14.\nScaling fits and data for the chiral condensate Mb calculated with\nthe HISQ/tree action on lattices with temporal extent N\u03c4 = 8 (left) and the chiral\nsusceptibility \u03c7m,l (right). The data for Mb at ml /ms = 0.025 and for Mb and \u03c7m,l at\nml /ms = 0.05 are fit simultaneously using the O(4) scaling Ansatz. The points used in\nthe scaling fits are plotted using open symbols. The dotted lines give the data scaled\nto the physical quark masses.\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n26\n\nThe analysis also demonstrated that HISQ/tree and asqtad action give consistent\nresults in the continuum limit. The Budapest-Wuppertal collaboration found Tc =\n147(2)(3)MeV, 157(3)(3)MeV and 155(3)(3)MeV defined as peak position in \u03c7R ,\ninflection points in h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8isub and \u2206R\nl respectively [74]. These agree with the above value\nwithin errors.\n5.5. The chiral transition temperature for small chemical potential\nThe scaling analysis described in the above subsection is also useful for the determination\nof the chiral transition temperature for small quark chemical potential. Also for nonzero quark chemical potential the phase transition happens at t = 0. Together with Eq.\n(42) this implies that the \u03bcq dependence of the chiral phase transition temperature is\ngiven by\nTc0 (\u03bcq )\n\n=\n\nTc0 (0)\n\n\u2212 \u03bal\n\n\u03bcl\nTc0\n\n!2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bcl\n+O\uf8ed 0\nTc\n\n!4 \uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(51)\n\nThe value of \u03bal can be determined through lattice calculations of the mixed susceptibility\n\u03c7t,l [142]. The mixed susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the\nscaling function of the order parameter fG (z)\n2\u03bal T \u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)/(\u03b2\u03b4) \u2032\n\u03c7t,l\n=\nh\nfG (z).\n(52)\nT\nt0 ms\nCalculations with p4 action on N\u03c4 = 4 and 8 lattices of the mixed susceptibility have\nbeen performed for several quark masses and resulted in the value [142]\n\u03bal = 0.059(2)(4).\n\n(53)\n\nThis result for the curvature of the critical line is about factor of two larger than the\nresult obtained in Ref. [148, 149] using multi-parameter re-weighting technique. On\nthe other hand it is consistent with the results obtained using the imaginary chemical\npotential technique [150, 151, 152].\nFinally let me mention that the study of the mixed susceptibility allows to estimate\nthe width of the chiral crossover for physical light quark masses. The pseudo-critical\ntemperatures Tt,l and Tm,l are determined by the peak positions zp of the fG\u2032 (z) and\nf\u03c7 (z) when scaling violations are neglected. Namely,\nTp,l \u2212 Tc0\nzp 1/(\u03b2\u03b4)\n=\nH\n, p = m, t.\n(54)\nTc0\nz0\nThe peak positions of the above scaling functions for O(4) model have been determined\nto be zp = 0.74(4) and 1.374(30) respectively [147]. From these and from the values\nof z0 and Tc0 published in Ref. [142] for p4 action one can estimate Tm,l to be higher\nthan Tt,l by 4MeV and 2MeV for physical value of the light quark mass for N\u03c4 = 8\nand 4 respectively. These estimates are reliable since the scaling violations were found\nto be small for p4 action [142]. In particular, the combination \u2212ms t0 h(1\u2212\u03b2)/(\u03b2\u03b4) \u03c7t,l /T 2\nas function of z has a peak at z \u2243 0.74 [142]. It remains to be seen how this picture\nchanges when HISQ/tree action is used.\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n27\n\n6. Equation of State\nThe equation of state has been calculated using different improved staggered fermion\nactions p4, asqtad, stout and HISQ/tree. The calculation of thermodynamic\nobservables proceeds through the calculation of the trace of the energy momentum\ntensor, \u01eb \u2212 3p, also known as trace anomaly or interaction measure. This is due to the\nfact that this quantity can be expressed in terms of expectation values of local gluonic\nand fermionic operators, (see e.g. Ref. [122]). Different thermodynamic observables can\nbe obtained from the interaction measure through integration of the trace anomaly \u266f.\nThe pressure can be written as\nZ T\ndT \u2032\np(T ) p(T0 )\n\u2212\n=\n(\u01eb \u2212 3p).\n(55)\nT4\nT04\nT0 T \u20325\nThe lower integration limit T0 is chosen such that the pressure is exponentially small\nthere. Furthermore, the entropy density can be written as s = (\u01eb + p)/T . Since the\ninteraction measure is the basic thermodynamic observable in the lattice calculations it\nis worth to discuss its properties more in detail. In Fig. 15 (left panel) I show the results\nof calculation with p4 and asqtad actions using N\u03c4 = 6 and 8 lattices and light quark\nmasses ml = ms /10, where ms is the physical strange quark mass. These calculations\ncorrespond in the continuum limit to the pion mass of 220MeV and 260MeV for p4 and\nasqtad respectively. The interaction measure shows a rapid rise in the transition region\nand after reaching a peak at temperatures of about 200MeV decreases. Cutoff effects\n(i.e. N\u03c4 dependence) appears to be the strongest around the peak region and decrease\nat high temperatures. For temperatures T < 270MeV calculations with p4 and asqtad\nactions have been extended to smaller quark masses, ml = ms /20, that correspond to\nthe pion mass of about 160MeV in the continuum limit [154, 155]. It turns out that the\nquark mass dependence is negligible for ml < ms /10. Furthermore, for astqad action\ncalculations have been extended to N\u03c4 = 12 lattices [155, 156]. The trace anomaly\nwas calculated with HISQ/tree action on lattices with temporal extent N\u03c4 = 6 and 8\nand ml = ms /20 [155, 156] (corresponding to m\u03c0 = 160MeV in the continuum limit).\nFinally, calculation of the trace anomaly and the equation of state was performed with\nstout action using N\u03c4 = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 and physical light quark masses [153].\nUsing the lattice data from N\u03c4 = 6, 8, 10 a continuum estimate for different quantities\nwas given [153]. In Fig. 15 (right panel) the results of different lattice calculations of\n\u01eb \u2212 3p corresponding to the pion masses close to the physical value are summarized.\nI also compare the lattice results with the parametrization s95p-v1 of \u01eb \u2212 3p. This\nparametrization combines lattice QCD results of Refs. [87, 122] at high temperatures\nwith hadron resonance gas model (HRG) at low temperatures (T < 170MeV) [135].\nAt low temperatures there is a fair agreement between the results obtained with stout\naction and the results obtained with HISQ/tree action as well as with asqtad action for\nN\u03c4 = 12. All these lattice results are slightly above the HRG curve. For N\u03c4 = 8 cutoff\neffects are significant for asqtad and p4 action. As the result the corresponding lattice\n\u266f A somewhat different approach was used in Ref. [153]\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n28\n\ndata fall below the HRG (s95p-v1) curve at low temperatures. When cutoff effects\nin the hadron spectrum are taken into account in the HRG model a good agreement\nbetween the p4 data and HRG result can be achieved [135]. The height of the peak in\n\u01eb \u2212 3p is the same for asqtad and HISQ/tree actions. At the same time it is smaller\nfor the stout action. Since the dominant cutoff effects of order a2 T 2 are eliminated, the\nN\u03c4 -dependence is expected to be small for p4, asqtad and HISQ/tree action at high\ntemperatures. We see that for T > 250MeV all these lattice actions lead to similar\nresults. At temperatures above 350MeV we also see a good agreement with the stout\nresults.\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n9\n8\n\n(\u03b5-3p)/T\n\n4\n\n8\n\nHISQ: N\u03c4=8\nN\u03c4=6\nasqtad: N\u03c4=12\nN\u03c4=8\np4, N\u03c4=8\nstout, cont.\ns95p-v1\n\n4\n\n(\u03b5-3p)/T\n\nTr0\n\n7\n6\n\n7\n\nasqtad: N\u03c4=8\n6\np4: N\u03c4=8\n6\n\n6\n5\n4\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n0\n100\n\nT [MeV]\n\nT [MeV]\n\n0\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFigure 15.

Also shown in the figure are the continuum estimates\nobtained with stout action and the parametrization based on hadron resonance gas\n(HRG) model [135].\n\nThe pressure, the energy density and the entropy density are shown in Fig. 16. The\nenergy density shows a rapid rise in the temperature region (170\u2212200) MeV and quickly\napproaches about 90% of the ideal gas value. The pressure rises less rapidly but at the\nhighest temperature it is also only about 15% below the ideal gas value. In the previous\ncalculations with the p4 action it was found that the pressure and the energy density are\nbelow the ideal gas value by about 25% at high temperatures [157]. A possible reason\nfor this larger deviation could be the fact that the quark masses used in this calculation\nwere fixed in units of temperature instead being tuned to give constant meson masses\nas lattice spacing is decreased. As discussed in Ref. [158] this could reduce the pressure\nby 10 \u2212 15% at high temperatures. In Fig. 16 I also show the entropy density divided\nby the corresponding ideal gas value and compare the results of lattice calculations\nwith resummed perturbative calculation [159, 160] as well as with the predictions from\nAdS/CFT correspondence for the strongly coupled supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\n[161]. The later is considerably below the lattice results. Note that the pressure, the\nenergy density and the trace anomaly have also been recently discussed in the framework\nof resummed perturbative calculations which seem to agree with lattice data quite well\nat high temperatures[162].\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n29\n\nThe difference between the stout action and the p4 and asqtad actions for the\ntrace anomaly translates into the differences in the pressure and the energy density.\nIn particular, the energy density is about 20% below the ideal gas limit for the stout\naction.\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n14\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\u03b5SB/T4\n\nTr0\n\n16\n\n1\n\ns/sSB\n\n4\n\n\u03b5/T\n\n0.8\n\n12\n10\n\nAdS/CFT\n4\n\n3p/T\n\n8\n6\n\np4\nasqtad\np4\nasqtad\n\n0.6\n\np4: N\u03c4=8\n6\nasqtad: N\u03c4=8\n6\nstout, cont.\nperturbative, NLA\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\nT [MeV]\n\n0\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550\n\nT [MeV]\n\n0\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\n\nFigure 16.

Medium modification of meson spectral functions can serve as\ndiagnostic tools of the medium created in heavy ion collisions. For example, the excess\nin the low mass dilepton rate can be related to the modification of the light vector meson\nspectral function (see Ref. [163] for a recent review). The suppression of quarkonium\nyield was suggested by Matsui and Satz as signal for QGP formation in heavy ion\ncollisions [164]. Studying quarkonium melting in QGP and the consequent suppression\nof the quarkonium yield is subject of a large experimental and theoretical effort (see\nRefs. [165, 166, 167, 168] for reviews).\nThe spectral function \u03c3H (\u03c9, ~p) for a given meson channel H in a system at\ntemperature T can be defined through the Fourier transform of the real time two point\nfunctions D > and D < or equivalently as the imaginary part of the Fourier transformed\nretarded correlation function [57],\n1\n<\n\u03c3H (\u03c9, ~p)\n=\n(D > (\u03c9, ~p) \u2212 DH\n(\u03c9, ~p))\n2\u03c0 H\n1\nR\n= ImDH\n(\u03c9, ~p)\n\u03c0\nZ\nZ\n>(<)\n\nDH\n\n\u221e\n\n(\u03c9, ~p) =\n\n>\nDH\n(t, ~x)\n\n<\nDH\n(t, ~x)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt\n\n>(<)\n\nd3 xei\u03c9t\u2212i~p*~x DH\n\n= hJH (t, ~x), JH (0, ~0)i\n= hJH (0, ~0), JH (t, ~x)i, t > 0\n\n(t, ~x)\n\n(56)\n\n(57)\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\u0393\n\u03b35\n\u03b3s\n\u03b3s \u03b3s\u2032\n1\n\u03b35 \u03b3s\n\n2S+1\n1\n\nLJ\n\nS0\nS1\n1\nP1\n3\nP0\n3\nP1\n3\n\nJPC\n0\u2212+\n1\u2212\u2212\n1+\u2212\n0++\n1++\n2++\n\nuu cc(n = 1)\n\u03c0\n\u03b7c\n\u03c1\nJ/\u03c8\nb1\nhc\na0\n\u03c7c0\na1\n\u03c7c1\n\u03c7c2\n\n30\ncc(n = 2)\n\u2032\n\u03b7c\n\u03c8\u2032\n\nbb(n = 1)\n\u03b7b\n\u03a5(1S)\nhb\n\u03c7b0 (1P )\n\u03c7b1 (1P )\n\u03c7b2 (1P )\n\nbb(n = 2)\n\u03b7b\u2032\n\u03a5(2S)\n\u03c7b0 (2P )\n\u03c7b1 (2P )\n\u03c7b2 (2P )\n\nTable 1.

For a quasi-particle in\nthe medium one gets a smeared peak, with the width being the thermal width. As one\nincreases the temperature the width increases and at sufficiently high temperatures, the\ncontribution from the meson state in the spectral function may be sufficiently broad.\nAt some point it is not very meaningful to speak of it as a well defined state any more.\nThe spectral function as defined in Eq. (61) can be directly accessible by high energy\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n31\n\nheavy ion experiments. More precisely, the spectral function for the vector current is\ndirectly related to the differential thermal cross section for the production of dilepton\npairs [169, 170]:\ndW\nd\u03c9d3p\n\n=\np\n~=0\n\n2\n5\u03b1em\n1\n\u03c3V (\u03c9, ~p).\n2\n2\n\u03c9/T\n27\u03c0 \u03c9 (e\n\u2212 1)\n\n(63)\n\nd3 xei~p.~x hT\u03c4 JH (\u03c4, ~x)JH (0, ~0)i\n\n(64)\n\nThen presence or absence of a bound state in the spectral function will manifest itself\nin the peak structure of the differential dilepton rate.\nIn finite temperature lattice calculations, one calculates Euclidean time\npropagators, usually projected to a given spatial momentum:\nGH (\u03c4, ~p) =\n\nZ\n\n>\nThis quantity is an analytical continuation of DH\n(x0 , p~)\n>\nGH (\u03c4, ~p) = DH\n(\u2212i\u03c4, p~).\n\n(65)\n\n<\nThe KMS condition implies the following relation for the Fourier transforms of DH\nand\n>\nDH\n<\n>\n>\nDH\n(\u03c9, ~p) = DH\n(\u2212\u03c9, ~p) = e\u2212\u03c9/T DH\n(\u03c9, ~p).\n\n(66)\n\nThis leads to a relation between D > (\u03c9, ~p) and the spectral function\n>\nDH\n(\u03c9, ~p) = 2\u03c0\u03c3H (\u03c9, ~p)e\u03c9/T /(e\u03c9/T \u2212 1).\n\n(67)\n\nUsing this and Eq.

Equation (68) is valid in the continuum. Formally the same spectral\nrepresentation can be written for the Euclidean correlator calculated on the lattice\nGlat\np). The corresponding spectral function, however, will be distorted by the effect\nH (\u03c4, ~\nof the finite lattice spacing, in particular, the spectral function is zero above certain\nenergy \u03c9 > \u03c9max . These distortions have been calculated in the free theory [171, 172].\nWhen discussing the numerical results in following sections the subscript H denoting\ndifferent channels for meson correlators and spectral functions will be omitted unless\nstated otherwise.\nTo get some information on the spectral functions from lattice QCD the\ncorresponding Euclidean time correlation functions have to be calculated at as many\nseparations in the time direction as possible, i.e. one should use large N\u03c4 . One way\nto accomplish this task with available computer resources is to use anisotropic lattices,\ni.e. lattices with different spacings at and as in time and space directions, such that\n\u03be = at /as > 1. In addition one also often uses the quenched approximation for studying\nspectral functions on the lattice.\nK(\u03c9, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n32\n\nThe low frequency limit of the vector spectral function gives information about the\ntransport coefficients of the medium, namely the electric conductivity and the heavy\nquark diffusion constant. Other transport coefficients, such as the shear and bulk\nviscosity are related to the correlation functions of gluonic operators (see Ref. [173]\nfor a review). The quark flavor diffusion constant Dq can be defined through the time\nderivative of the quark number density in the rest frame of the thermal system as follows\n\u2202t nq = Dq \u22072 nq + O(\u22073 ).\n\n(69)\n\nThis equation holds for small deviation from thermal equilibrium. The quark flavor\ndiffusion constant can be determined from the spatial component of the vector spectral\nfunction as follows\n\u03c3ii (\u03c9)\n1\nlim\n,\n(70)\nDq =\n3\u03c7q \u03c9\u21920 \u03c9\nhere \u03c7q is the quark number susceptibility. The electric conductivity is related to the\ncorrelation function of electric currents\nJ\u03bcem =\n\nX\n\nQf q\u0304f (t, ~x)\u03b3\u03bc qf (t, ~x),\n\n(71)\n\nf\n\nwith Qf being the electric charge of quark flavor f . The correlator of the electromagnetic\ncurrent receives contribution from quark line connected and quark line disconnected\ndiagrams. At high temperatures the contribution from the disconnected diagrams is\nsmall. For degenerate quark flavors the electric conductivity can be written as [174]\n\u03b6=\n\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\uf8f62\nX\n\uf8ef\n\u03c7q \uf8f0\uf8ed Qf \uf8f8 Dq,disc\nf\n\n\uf8eb\n\n+\uf8ed\n\nX\nf\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f9\n\nQ2f \uf8f8 Dq,con \uf8fb , Dq = Dq,con + Dq,dis .

The quark flavor diffusion coefficient for single heavy quark flavor\n(mq \u226b T ) is called the heavy quark diffusion constant D. It is related to the momentum\ndrag coefficient \u03b7 in the Langevin dynamics of heavy quarks [175]:\nD=\n\nT\n.\nmq \u03b7\n\n(73)\n\nIn lattice QCD one also calculates meson correlation function in one of the spatial\ndirections, say z\nG(z, T ) =\n\nZ\n\ndxdy\n\nZ\n\n1/T\n\n0\n\nd\u03c4 hJ(x, y, z, \u03c4 )J(0, 0, 0, 0)i.\n\n(74)\n\nThe spatial correlation function is related to the meson spectral function at non-zero\nspatial momentum\n\u03c3(\u03c9, pz , T )\n.\n(75)\n\u03c9\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nThus the temperature dependence of the spatial correlation function also provides\ninformation about the temperature dependence of the spectral function.

If there is a lowest lying meson state of mass M, i.e. the spectral function can\nbe well approximated by Eq. (62), then the long distance behavior of the spatial meson\ncorrelation function is determined by the meson mass, i.e. Mscr = M. At very high\ntemperatures\nq the quark and anti-quark are not bound and the meson screening mass is\ngiven by 2 (\u03c0T )2 + m2q , where mq is the quark mass and \u03c0T is the lowest Matsubara\nfrequency. Therefore, a detailed study of spatial meson correlators and screening masses\ncan provide some information about the melting of meson states at high temperatures.\nOne would like to obtain the spectral functions through lattice calculation of\nthe temporal meson correlation function. The obvious difficulty in the reconstruction\nof the spectral function from Eq. (68) is the fact that the Euclidean correlator is\ncalculated only at O(10) data points on the lattice, while for a reasonable discretization\nof the integral in Eq. (68) we need O(100) degrees of freedom. The problem can be\nsolved using Bayesian analysis of the correlator, where one looks for a spectral function\nwhich maximizes the conditional probability P [\u03c3|DH] of having the spectral function\n\u03c3 given the data D and some prior knowledge H (for reviews see [176, 177]). Different\nBayesian methods differ in the choice of the prior knowledge. One version of this\nanalysis which is extensively used in the literature is the Maximum Entropy Method\n(MEM) [178, 179]. It has been used to study different correlation functions in QCD\n[179, 176, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193]. In this\nmethod the basic prior knowledge is the positivity of the spectral function and the prior\nknowledge is given by the Shannon - Janes entropy\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9)\n) .\nd\u03c9 \u03c3(\u03c9) \u2212 m(\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03c9) ln(\nm(\u03c9)\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(76)\n\nThe real function m(\u03c9) is called the default model and parametrizes all additional prior\nknowledge about the spectral functions, e.g. such as the asymptotic behavior at high\nenergy [179, 176]. For MEM the conditional probability can be written as\n1\nP [\u03c3|DH] = exp(\u2212 \u03c72 + \u03b1S),\n(77)\n2\nwith \u03c72 being the standard likelihood function and \u03b1 is a real parameter.\nEarly results on meson spectral functions obtained with MEM gave a number of\nunexpected results. In particular, the MEM analysis of the charmonium correlators\ncalculated in quenched QCD suggested that 1S charmonium states can survive in QGP\nup to temperatures as high as 1.6Tc (see e.g. [188]). Here Tc is the deconfinement\nphase transition temperature of SU(3) gauge theory. This is in odds with the expected\nmedium modification of the heavy quark potential that in addition to the effects of\ncolor screening also includes an imaginary part [73, 194]. In fact, many potential\nmodel calculations indicate melting of 1S charmonium state in the deconfined medium\n[195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]. Furthermore, even in the light meson spectral functions\npeak structures have been observed [185]. It is not clear to what extent these correspond\nto physical effects or are artifacts of the calculations.

Quarkonium spectral functions at zero temperature\nThe best way to understand the structure of meson spectral functions and the issues\nrelated to their determination on the lattice is to consider the case of heavy quarkonium\nat zero temperature. Charmonium correlation functions have been studied in detail in\nRef. [201] using quenched anisotropic lattices and the so-called Fermilab formulations\nfor heavy quarks [202]. Spectral functions have been extracted using MEM. The spectral\nfunctions in the pseudo-scalar channel calculated at three lattice spacings are shown in\nFig. 17. The first peak corresponds to the ground state, \u03b7c (1S). The second peak is\nactually the combination of several excited states, since MEM cannot resolve individual\nexcited meson states due to the small splitting between them [201]. For \u03c9 > 5 GeV we\nsee the continuum. The spectral function becomes zero above certain energy \u03c9 due to the\npresence of finite lattice as expected in the free theory. In Fig. 17 I also show the spectral\nfunction calculated for different default models m(\u03c9). The default model dependence\nis small for \u03c9 < 5GeV, while above that energy it is significant due to the fact that\nthere are only very few data points that carry information about the spectral function\nin that region. As the temperature increases the number of data points available for\nthe analysis as well as the maximal extent of the time direction \u03c4max = 1/(2T ) become\nsmaller. To demonstrate this point in Fig. 18 I show the zero temperature charmonium\nspectral function calculated with different number of data points and \u03c4max that are\ncharacteristic for temperatures corresponding to QGP. As \u03c4max decreases MEM looses\nthe ability to reconstruct the peak corresponding the excited states and the ground state\npeak is significantly broadens. For \u03c4max = 0.22fm even the position of the ground state\npeak is not reproduced correctly.

The dependence of the pseudo-scalar spectral function on \u03c4max .\n\nparticular, the presence of the ground state peak also becomes sensitive to the default\nmodel.\nSince the analysis of the quarkonium spectral functions using MEM turns out to be\nquite complicated already in the zero temperature limit, it is important to understand\nthe temperature dependence of the quarkonium correlation functions and try to identify\npossible sources of the temperature dependence that are related to melting of the bound\nstates. From Eq. (68) it is clear that the temperature dependence of the meson\ncorrelation functions comes from two sources: the trivial temperature dependence of\nthe integration kernel K(\u03c4, \u03c9) and the temperature dependence of the spectral function\n\u03c3(\u03c9, T ). To get rid of the first trivial temperature dependence one can consider the\nreconstructed correlation function\nGrec (\u03c4, T ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\u03c3(\u03c9, T = 0)K(\u03c9, \u03c4 ).\n\n(78)\n\nIf the spectral function does not change across the deconfinement transition\nG(\u03c4, T )/Grec(\u03c4, T ) should be unity. Deviations of this ratio from unity indicate\ntemperature dependence of the spectral functions. The ratio G(\u03c4, T )/Grec(\u03c4, T ) was\nfirst studied in Ref. [189] and subsequently in Refs. [190, 193, 201, 203]. It was\nfound that in the pseudo-scalar channel this ratio stays close to one and shows only\nsmall temperature dependence. This seemed to support the conclusion based on the\nspectral functions extracted from MEM that ground state charmonium survives in the\ndeconfined phase up to temperatures 1.6Tc . In the scalar and axial-vector channels large\ntemperature dependence in G(\u03c4, T )/Grec(\u03c4, T ) was observed. This was interpreted as\nmelting of 1P charmonium states and fitted well into the expected picture of sequential\nmelting. However, this conclusion was premature. In the deconfined phase there is an\nadditional contribution to the spectral functions at very low frequency. This can be\neasily seen by calculating the spectral function in the free theory. In addition to the\ncontribution to the spectral function that starts at twice the heavy quark mass there\nis a contribution proportional to \u03c9\u03b4(\u03c9) in all but the pseudo-scalar channel [172]. The\ndelta function is smeared once the interactions of the heavy quarks with the medium\nare taken into account.

The area under\nthe transport peak is given by the quark number susceptibility \u03c7q . For large quark\nmass the transport peak is narrow and is well separated from the high energy part of\nthe spectral function that corresponds to bound states and/or unbound heavy quark\nanti-quark pairs. We expect similar structure in the spectral function in other channels\nas well.

The spectral functions in pseudo-scalar channel calculated at T = 1.5Tc\nand compared to the zero temperature spectral function obtained using \u03c4max = 1/(2T ).\nIn the left panel the spectral functions obtained with m(\u03c9) = const are shown, while\nin the right panel the default model was obtained from the T = 0 spectral function.\n\nand are close to one for all temperatures, including the highest temperature of 3Tc .\nThis means that the large temperature dependence seen in G/Grec for the scalar and\naxial-vector channels comes mostly from the temperature dependence of Glow (\u03c4, T )\nand is not related to melting of P-wave charmonium states. A question arises how\nthe observed temperature (in)dependence of Ghigh (\u03c4, T ) is related to the expected inmedium modification of the heavy quark potential and melting of quarkonium states at\nsufficiently high temperatures. This question was addressed in Refs. [197], where the\nquarkonium spectral functions have been calculated using potential model with screened\npotential. It was found that despite the significant change in the spectral functions the\nEuclidean correlator obtained from them do not change significantly in the deconfined\nmedium and are compatible with the lattice results. Including the imaginary part in\nthe analysis did not change this conclusion [199]. Attempts to reconstruct quarkonium\nspectral functions using MEM have been presented in Refs. [186, 188, 189, 190, 201]\nand no evidence for melting of quarkonium states has been found. However, in view of\nthe difficulties related to the MEM analysis for small \u03c4max and limited number of data\npoints one should be careful drawing conclusions. In particular the dependence of the\nresults on the default model should be examined. In Fig. 21 I show charmonium spectral\nfunctions in the pseudo-scalar channel calculated at 1.5Tc and at zero temperature for\ntwo default models: m(\u03c9) = const and m(\u03c9) that equals to the zero temperature\nspectral function for \u03c9 > 5GeV and smoothly matched to a constant below that energy\n[201]. In both cases the difference between the spectral function at 1.5Tc and T = 0 is\nsmall. However, the shape of the spectral function depends on the default model. While\nfor m(\u03c9) = const we see a peak structure for more realistic choice of the default model\nthis peak structure is absent even at zero temperature. Recent analysis of charmonium\nspectral function based on isotropic lattices that uses free lattice spectral function also\ndoes not find peak structure that can be associated with 1S state in the deconfined phase\n[206] It is not clear to what extent the absence of bound state peaks is consequence of\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n38\n\nquarkonium melting in QGP or due to the limited data set. It is clear, however, that\nexisting MEM calculations of the spectral function do not provide evidence for existence\nof quarkonium bound states in QGP.\nThe analysis described so far was performed in the quenched approximation.\nCalculation of the charmonium correlators and spectral functions was also performed\nin two flavor QCD [207]. The findings of this analysis are similar to the ones described\nabove. Furthermore, in the case of the bottomonium correlators and spectral functions\nhave been studied using NRQCD [208, 209]. The main advantage of the NRQCD\napproach is that it allows to study correlators at larger Euclidean time separations,\nnamely \u03c4max = 1/T . Furthermore, there is no low energy contribution to the spectral\nfunctions and thus the temperature dependence of the corresponding Euclidean time\ncorrelation function is directly related to the properties and melting of the bound\nstates. A significant temperature dependence has been seen in the scalar bottomonium\ncorrelators that may indicate the melting of the P-wave bottomonium at temperatures\nslightly above the transition temperature.\n7.2. Meson spectral functions at non-zero temperature in the light quark sector\nEarly attempts to calculate light meson spectral functions in QGP using MEM were\npresented in Refs. [180, 183, 185, 187]. The results were inconclusive and to some\nextent confusing as peak structures in the spectral functions have been found up to 3Tc\nand no continuum was observed at high energies. It was pointed out, however, that even\nwithout using MEM Euclidean correlation functions can put stringent constraints on the\nspectral functions [180, 187]. In the vector channel the correlation function calculated\non N\u03c4 = 12 and N\u03c4 = 16 lattices was found to deviate from the free value by less than\n10% [180]. In the pseudo-scalar channel on the other hand a large enhancement over\nthe free theory result was observed [187] possibly indicating non-perturbative effects in\nQGP.\nMore recently a detailed calculation of the vector correlation function on large\nquenched lattices was reported for T \u2243 1.45Tc [210]. Calculations were performed using\nseveral lattice spacings. This enabled a reliable extrapolation to the continuum limit\nand it was found that the correlator never exceeds the free theory value by more than\n9% [210]. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 22. Furthermore, the spectral\nfunctions reconstructed with MEM showed no evidence for peak like structures [210].\nSince vector correlator is so close to the free limit the authors of Ref. [210] obtained the\nspectral function using the following model\n3\n\u03c9\u0393/2\n1\n+\n(1 + k)\u03c9 2 tanh(\u03c9/4T )\u0398(\u03c90, \u2206\u03c9 ),\n2\n2\n\u03c0 \u03c9 + (\u0393/2)\n2\u03c0\n(\u03c90 \u2212\u03c9)/\u03c9\u2206\u03c9 \u22121\n\u0398(\u03c90 , \u2206\u03c9 ) = (1 + e\n) ,\n(82)\n\u03c3ii (\u03c9)\n\n= cBW \u03c7q\n\nand treating cBW , \u0393 and k as fit parameters.

One can see from Fig. 22\nthat while somewhat broad the transport peak is clearly visible in the vector spectral\nfunction contrary to the expectation based in strongly coupled supersymmetric YangMills theory where the transport peak is absent [211]. On the other hand the analysis\nof the same lattice data using a different approach lead to much smaller value of the\nelectric conductivity and no clear transport peak [174]. This may indicate that much\nmore work is needed till a reliable result for the electric conductivity can be quoted.\n7.3. Spatial meson correlation functions\nAs discussed above spatial meson correlators are also sensitive to in-medium\nmodification of the meson spectral functions. In particular, the change in the meson\nspectral functions is reflected in the meson screening masses, which should be close to\nthe vacuum masses at low temperatures. At high temperatures, on the other hand, the\nmeson screening masses should approach 2\u03c0T corresponding to the free quark limit. In\nthe past meson screening masses have been studied in quenched approximation [212, 213]\nand the sharp change in their behavior was observed at the transition temperature. More\nrecently spatial meson correlators and screening masses have been studied in 2+1 flavor\nQCD for physical strange quark mass and light quark masses ml = ms /10 with p4 action\n[141]. In the case of full QCD rapid change of the spatial correlators and screening masses\nis expected in the vicinity of the chiral crossover. Numerical calculations show that this\nis indeed the case [141]. In Fig. 23 the meson screening masses in the pseudo-scalar\nand vector channels are shown as function of the temperature and the rapid change in\nthe behavior of the screening masses takes place around 200MeV, which is close to the\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n40\n\n8\n7\n\nMscr/T\n\n6\n5\n4\n\nPS\nVC\n\n3\n2\n1\n100\n\nT [MeV]\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nFigure 23. Meson screening masses for light quarks in the pseudo-scalar and vector\nchannels as function of the temperature calculated in 2+1 flavor QCD with p4 action on\nN\u03c4 = 6 (filled symbols) and N\u03c4 = 8 (open symbols) lattices [141]. The solid black line\ncorresponds to the limit of free quarks 2\u03c0T . The dashed lines are the NLO results [214]\nevaluated with a 2-loop running coupling constant in M S-scheme for \u03bc = \u03c0T, 2\u03c0T\nand 4\u03c0T .\n\nchiral crossover temperature Tc for those lattices. The effective restoration of the chiral\nsymmetry above the crossover temperature should manifest in approximate degeneracy\nof the vector and axial-vector correlation functions. Such degeneracy is observed at\ntemperature 200MeV (c.f. Fig. 5 of Ref. [141]). As discussed in section 5 the UA (1)\nsymmetry is expected to be restored at sufficiently high temperatures. The effective\nrestoration of the UA (1) should manifest itself in the approximate degeneracy of flavor\nnon-singlet pseudo-scalar and scalar correlators. The difference between the scalar and\npseudo-scalar screening masses rapidly decreases above the transition temperature but\nbecomes compatible with zero only temperatures above 240MeV. Thus the effective\nrestoration of the axial symmetry happens at T \u2243 1.2Tc , with Tc being the chiral\ntransition temperature. Calculations using DWF formulations confirm this result [140].\nAt high temperatures the screening masses can be calculated using weak coupling\nmethods. The calculations of the screening masses up to next-to-leading order was\nperformed in Ref. [214] and the first perturbative correction turned out to be positive,\nnamely\n4T 2 1\ng ( + \u00ca0 ),\n(84)\nMscr = 2\u03c0T +\n3 2\u03c0\n2\nwith \u00ca0 \u2243 0.46939139 for Nf = 3 [214]. Furthermore, all the screening masses are\nexpected to be degenerate at next-to-leading order [214]. In Fig. 23 we compare the\nlattice data in 2+1 flavor case with the perturbative result of Ref. [214]. At high\ntemperatures we still see significant differences between the pseudo-scalar and vector\nscreening masses. Moreover the pseudo-scalar screening masses are smaller than 2\u03c0T .\nNote, however, that the lattice spacing (N\u03c4 ) dependence of the screening masses is\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n41\n\nnon-negligible. Thus it will be important in the future to perform calculations on finer\nlattices to get control over the continuum limit.\nSpatial meson correlators and screening masses have been calculated also for\ncharmonium [215]. The changes in the correlators and screening masses around the\ntransition temperature are much smaller than for the light mesons. This fits into the\npicture that ground state charmonium does not melt at the crossover temperature.\nHowever, for T > 300MeV we see large change also for the charmonium screening\nmasses. The behavior of the screening masses and their dependence on the spatial\nboundary conditions is compatible with the picture of unbound quarks [215]. This\ncorroborates the discussion in the previous subsection that there is no evidence for\nsurvival of charmonium states at temperatures of 1.5Tc .\n7.4. Heavy quark diffusion constant\nSince for sufficiently heavy quarks the transport peak is very narrow it is very difficult if\nnot impossible to determine the heavy quark diffusion using the procedure that was used\nfor the electric conductivity \u2020\u2020. Even for the smallest possible heavy quark diffusion\nconstant D \u2243 1/(2\u03c0T ) the low energy part of the vector correlator Glow (\u03c4, T ) shows\nvery little \u03c4 -dependence [204]. An alternative way to estimate the heavy quark diffusion\nconstant is integrate out the heavy quark fields and relate the drag coefficient to the\ncorrelation function of chromo-electric fields at time t and time 0 connected by Wilson\nlines [217, 218]. In particular, at leading order in the expansion in the inverse of heavy\nquark mass we have\n\u03ba\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndtGE (t)\n\n1\nd3 xhOEi (t, x)OEi (0, 0)i\nGE (t) =\n3T \u03c7q\nOEi (t, x) = \u03c6\u2020 (t, x)gE i (t, x)\u03c6(t, x) \u2212 \u03b8\u2020 (t, x)gE i (t, x)\u03b8(t, x).\nZ\n\n(85)\n\nHere \u03c6 and \u03b8 are the static quark and anti-quark fields, and E i is the chromo-electric\nfield. It is easy to generalize the above expression to Euclidean time and define the\ncorresponding correlator GE (\u03c4 ) which after integrating the heavy quark fields becomes\n[218]\n1 hReTr (W (\u03b2, \u03c4 )gEi (\u03c4 )W (\u03c4, 0)Ei (\u03c4 ))i\n.\n(86)\n3\nReTrhW (\u03b2, 0)i\nThe above correlation function was also calculated in perturbation theory to next-toleading order [218]. The key difference between this correlation function and meson\ncorrelation function is that the transport contribution does not appear as a narrow\npeak in the corresponding spectral function This is principle should make it easier to\nestimate the corresponding transport coefficient. Numerical calculations of GE (\u03c4 ) have\nbeen performed in SU(3) gauge theory on lattices with temporal extent N\u03c4 = 12 \u2212 24\n[219, 220, 221]. The lattice data are significantly larger than the next-to-leading order\nGE (\u03c4 ) = \u2212\n\n\u2020\u2020 attempts along these lines have been presented in Ref. [216]\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n42\n\nresult. Comparing the numerical results with a model correlation function based on\nperturbative calculations of Ref. [218] and strong coupling calculations in N = 4 SuperYang-Mills theory [217] it was concluded that the heavy quark diffusion constant should\nbe in the range\nD = (0.5 \u2212 1.0)/T.\n\n(87)\n\nThe above value is considerably smaller than the perturbative estimate [175] and lies in\nthe range used in phenomenological models [168].\n8. Conclusions\nIn recent years significant progress has been made in studying chiral and deconfining\naspects of the QCD transition in finite temperature QCD. For several quantities that are\nrelevant for the discussion of these aspects continuum extrapolation has been performed.\nCalculations by two groups that use different staggered quark formulation give results for\nthe chiral transition temperature that agree in the continuum limit. It is now established\nthat for physical value of chiral transition temperature is Tc \u2243 150MeV. Calculations\nusing Wilson fermion or DWF formulation have been performed for physical or nearly\nphysical quark masses and seem to confirm the staggered fermion results. The universal\nbehavior of the chiral transition in the limit of vanishing light quark masses plays an\nimportant role also for the physical values of the light quark masses and allows to define\nthe chiral crossover temperature in a meaningful way.\nThe interplay between chiral and deconfinement aspects of the transition appears\nto be more complicated than earlier lattice studies suggested. There is no transition\ntemperature that can be associated with the deconfining aspects of the transition for\nphysical values of the light quark masses. Furthermore, the behavior of the Polyakov\nloop suggests that color screening sets in at temperatures that are higher than the chiral\ntransition temperature. The deconfinement aspects of the QCD transition have been\nalso studied in terms of fluctuations of conserved charges. In principle these fluctuations\nare are also sensitive to universal aspects of the chiral transition. However, for the\nlowest order, i.e. quadratic fluctuations the contribution coming from the regular\npart of the free energy density dominates. This implies in particular, that inflection\npoints of the quark number susceptibilities cannot be used to define the transition\ntemperature. Higher order fluctuations of conserved charges are more sensitive to the\nsingular contribution and therefore are more suitable to study the interplay between\nchiral and deconfining aspects of the QCD transition at finite temperature. The\nrestoration of the UA (1) symmetry at high temperature has been also discussed and\nit was found that it is effectively restored at temperatures T \u2243 1.2Tc .\nIn the high temperature region ( T > 300 MeV) lattice results have been compared\nwith the results obtained in weak coupling approaches, which seem to capture the\nqualitative features of the lattice data. In some cases we see a good agreement at\nquantitative level.\n\n\fLattice QCD at non-zero temperature\n\n43\n\nFinally I discussed lattice results on meson correlation functions. These are useful\nto study the fate of quarkonium states in QGP as well as for determination of some\ntransport coefficients. While a lot of progress has been made in studying meson\ncorrelation functions and extracting the corresponding spectral functions more work\nis needed to reach definitive conclusions.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC0298CH10886.
