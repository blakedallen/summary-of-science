ZHANG\nA BSTRACT. An analogue of Serre's theorem is established for finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras, which describes presentations in terms of Chevalley generators\nand Serre type relations relative to all possible choices of Borel subalgebras. The proof\nof the theorem is conceptually transparent; it also provides an alternative approach to\nSerre's theorem for ordinary Lie algebras.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\n1.0.1. A well known theorem of Serre gave presentations of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras in terms of Chevalley generators and Serre relations. It was generalised to Kac-Moody algebras with symmetrisable Cartan matrices by Gabber and Kac\n[9]. The theorem and its generalisation now provide the standard method to present\nsimple Lie algebras and Kac-Moody algebras [14], as well as the associated quantised\nuniversal enveloping algebras [4, 12].\nA natural question is how to present simple contragredient Lie superalgebras (i.e.,\nLie superalgebras with Cartan matrices) in a similar way. Surprisingly this was only\nseriously studied after quantised universal enveloping superalgebras [2] had become\npopular in the early 90s because of their applications in a variety of areas such as low\ndimensional topology [20, 29], statistical physics [2] and noncommutative geometry\n[22, 30, 31].\nIn the Lie superalgebra setting, unconventional higher order relations [19] are required beside the usual Serre relations, and their origin is somewhat mysterious. Since\na Serre type presentation is always given relative to a chosen Borel subalgebra, the\nissue is further complicated by the fact [13, 14] that a simple contragredient Lie superalgebra admits classes of Borel subalgebras, which are not Weyl group conjugate.\n1.0.2. At the present, investigation on Serre type presentations for Lie superalgebras\nis still rather incomplete even in the finite dimensional case. Presentations relative to\nmany non-distinguished Borel subalgebras of such Lie superalgebras have never been\nconstructed (see Remark 3.4). The crucial question on whether the Serre type relations\nobtained so far are complete (i.e., whether they are all the defining relations needed\nDate: January 12, 2011.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 17B05; Secondary 17B20, 17B22, 17B10.\nKey words and phrases. Lie superalgebras, root systems, presentations.\nSupported by the Australian Research Council.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nfor the Lie superalgebras under consideration) has not been answered satisfactorily.\nTherefore, there is the need of a systematic treatment of Serre presentations for the\nfinite dimensional simple contragredient Lie superalgebras, and this paper aims to provide such a treatment.\n1.0.3. It was Leites and Serganova [19] who first obtained the higher order Serre\nrelations for slm|n relative to the so-called distinguished Borel subalgebra (for which\nthe simple roots are the easiest to describe). The corresponding quantum relations for\nUq (slm|n ) were constructed in [24, 5]. Yamane [26] wrote down higher order quantum\nSerre relations for quantised universal enveloping superalgebras of finite dimensional\nsimple Lie superalgebras for the distinguished and some (but not all) non-distinguished\nBorel subalgebras. In the ensuing years, much further work was done to find Serre type\nrelations for Lie superalgebras by Leites and collaborators [6, 7, 1] and by Yamane\n[27].\nReferences [6, 7] and [26, 27] represent the current state of the problem of constructing Serre type presentations for the finite dimensional simple contragredient Lie\nsuperalgebras. [Reference [27] is largely on affine superalgebras.] However, the papers [26, 27] left out presentations of exceptional simple Lie superalgebras relative to\nnon-distinguished Borel subalgebras. Reference [6] in principle treated all the Dynkin\ndiagrams which could potentially require higher order Serre relations, but the relations in [6] and [26, 27] look very different and it is not clear at all whether they are\nequivalent.\n1.0.4. The problem on whether the Serre type relations constructed were complete\nwas only investigated by computer calculations. According to [6, \u00a71], completeness of\nthe relations of [6] was verified by computers for finite dimensional simple contragredient Lie superalgebras, but a conceptual proof is lacking. The problem is open for the\nSerre type relations given in [26, 27], and so is also in the infinite dimensional case.\nWe comment that in the cases considered in [26], completeness of the relations\ncan in principle be deduced from the existence of a non-degenerate invariant bilinear\nform between the quantised universal enveloping superalgebras of the upper and low\ntriangular Borel subalgebras, by using Geer's result [10] that quantised universal enveloping superalgebras are trivial deformations. However, it is a highly complicated\nmatter to establish the non-degeneracy of the bilinear form even in the case of ordinary\nquantised universal enveloping algebras (see, e.g., [21]). Many of the representation\ntheoretical results required for proving the non-degeneracy are lacking for quantised\nuniversal enveloping superalgebras, rendering the super case much more difficult.\n1.0.5. In this paper, we give a complete treatment of the Serre presentations of finite\ndimensional simple contragredient Lie superalgebras, proving an analogue of Serre's\ntheorem relative to all possible choices of Borel subalgebras. Comparing our results\nwith those of [26] (in the q \u2192 1 limit), we have many more higher order Serre relations\nwhich are necessary, especially in the case of exceptional Lie superalgebras relative to\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nnon-distinguished Borel subalgebras. Our method is also different from those in the\nliterature. It in particular automatically shows the completeness of the relations which\nwe construct.\n1.0.6. Let us now describe more precisely the results of this paper. Given a realisation\nof the Cartan matrix A = (ai j ) of a simple contragredient Lie superalgebra with the set\nof simple roots \u03a0b = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r }, we introduce an auxiliary Lie superalgebra g\u0303, which\nis generated by Chevalley generators {ei , fi , hi | i = 1, 2, . . ., r} subject to quadratic\nrelations only (see Definition 3.1, where more informative notation is used). Let r be\nthe Z2 -graded maximal ideal of g\u0303 that intersects trivially the Cartan subalgebra spanned\nby all hi . Then L := g\u0303/r is the simple Lie superalgebra which we started with in all\ncases except in type A(n, n) where L is sln+1|n+1 (see Theorem 3.3).\nWe introduce a Z2 -graded ideal s of the auxiliary Lie superalgebra, which is generated by explicitly given generators. A main result proved in Theorem 3.10 states that\ns = r, or equivalently, g := g\u0303/s \u223c\n= L. From this result, we deduce a super analogue\nof Serre's theorem, Theorem 3.11, which gives presentations of the finite dimensional\nsimple contragredient Lie superalgebras relative to all possible choices of Borel subalgebras.\nThe completeness of the relations in Theorem 3.11 is guaranteed by Theorem 3.10.\n1.0.7. The proof of Theorem 3.10 makes use of a Z-grading of g\u0303, which descends to\nL and g to give Z-gradings to these Lie superalgebras. Write L = \u2295k Lk and g = \u2295k gk\nwith respect the Z-gradings. Lemma 3.8 states that L0 \u223c\n= g0 as Lie superalgebras and\n\u223c\nLk = gk as g0 -modules for all k 6= 0. Then Theorem 3.10 follows from this lemma.\nThe unconventional Serre relations can now be understood as arising from two\nsources: the conditions for g\u00b11 to be irreducible g0 -modules; and the requirement\nthat [g\u00b11 , g\u00b11 ] = L\u00b12 and similar requirements at other degrees.\nRecall that Yamane [27] used odd reflections [25] to find such relations. Leites and\ncollaborators [19, 6] used homological algebra techniques and deduced relations from\ncertain spectral sequences.\nThe approach developed here is quite different from the methods in [6, 7, 1] and in\n[26, 27] at both the conceptual and technical level. It has the advantage of automatically generating a complete set of relations that is minimal. Conceptually the approach\nis quite transparent in the sense that one can see how the defining relations arise. It also\nprovides an alternative approach to Serre's theorem for finite dimensional semi-simple\nLie algebras, see Remark 5.2.\nWe also note that the proof in [9] of the generalised Serre theorem for Kac-Moody\nalgebras with symmetrisable Cartan matrices relied on structural properties of Verma\nmodules such as their embeddings, and also made use of the quadratic Casimir operator. The authors of both [27] and [6] commented on obstacles in generalising the proof\nto Lie superalgebras, especially difficulties related to the quadratic Casimir operator.\n\n\f4\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nWe may also add that one no longer has the properties of (generalised) Verma modules required by [9] in the context of Lie superalgebras, and this appears to be a more\nserious difficulty.\n1.0.8. The organisation of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews Kac's classification of finite dimensional simple classical Lie superalgebras [13], and also clarifies\ncertain subtle points about Cartan matrices and Dynkin diagrams in this context. Section 3 contains the statements of the main results, Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 3.11,\nwhich give presentations of contragredient Lie superalgebras in arbitrary root systems.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.10, which implies Theorem 3.11 as a corollary, is given by\nusing the key lemma, Lemma 3.8. Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the proof of the\nkey lemma. An outline of the proof is given in Section 4.2 to explain its conceptual\naspects. We end the paper with a discussion of possible generalisation of the method\ndeveloped here to affine Kac-Moody superalgebras to construct Serre type presentations in Section 6.\nTwo appendices are also included. Appendix A gives the root systems and Dynkin\ndiagrams of all simple contragredient Lie superalgebras [13, 8, 3]. The material is used\nthroughout the paper, and is also necessary in order to make precise the description of\nDynkin diagrams in non-distinguished root systems. Appendix B describes the structure of some generalised Verma modules of lowest weight type and their irreducible\nquotients, which enter the proof of Lemma 3.8.\nAcknowledgement. I wish to thank Professor Dimitry Leites for helpful suggestions.\n2. F INITE\n\nDIMENSIONAL SIMPLE\n\nL IE\n\nSUPERALGEBRAS\n\nIn this section, we present some background material, and clarify some tricky points\nabout Cartan matrices and Dynkin diagrams of Lie superalgebras.\n2.1. Finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras. We work over the field C of\ncomplex numbers throughout the paper.\n2.1.1. Classification. A Lie superalgebra g is a Z2 -graded vector space g = g0\u0304 \u2295 g1\u0304\nendowed with a bilinear map [ , ] : g \u00d7 g \u2212\u2192 g, (X ,Y ) 7\u2192 [X ,Y ], called the Lie superbracket, which is homogeneous of degree 0, graded skew-symmetric and satisfies the\nsuper Jacobian identity. The even subspace g0\u0304 of a Lie superalgebra g = g0\u0304 \u2295 g1\u0304 is a\nLie algebra in its own right, which is called the even subalgebra of g. The odd subspace g1\u0304 forms a g0\u0304 -module under the restriction of the adjoint action defined by the\nLie superbracket. If g0\u0304 is a reductive Lie algebra and g1\u0304 is a semi-simple g0\u0304 -module, g\nis called classical [13, 23].\nThe classification of the finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras was completed\nin the late 70s. The theorem below is taken from [13], which is still the best reference\non Lie superalgebras. Historical information and further references on the classification can be found in [16, 17] (also see [23]).\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nTheorem 2.1. The finite dimensional simple classical Lie superalgebras comprise of\nthe simple contragredient Lie superalgebras\nA(m, n),\nF(4),\n\nB(0, n),\nG(3),\n\nB(m, n), m > 0,\n\nC(n), n > 2,\n\nD(m, n), m > 1,\n\nD(2, 1; \u03b1), \u03b1 \u2208 C\\{0, \u22121},\n\nand simple strange Lie superalgebras P(n) and Q(n) (n \u2265 1).\nThe simple contragredient Lie superalgebras admit non-degenerate invariant bilinear\nforms, while the strange Lie superalgebras P(n) and Q(n) do not. In the remainder of\nthe paper, we shall consider only contragredient simple Lie superalgebras.\nThe A, B, C and D series are essentially the special linear and orthosymplectic Lie\nsuperalgebras, which are familiar examples of Lie superalgebras. The exceptional Lie\nsuperalgebras F(4), G(3) and D(2, 1; \u03b1) are less well-known, but one can understand\ntheir structures given the description of their roots in Appendix A.1.\nLet g = g0\u0304 \u2295 g1\u0304 be a simple contragredient Lie superalgebra, and choose a Cartan\nsubalgebra h for g, which by definition is just a Cartan subalgebra of g0\u0304 . Denote\nby g\u03b1 the root space of the root \u03b1, and call \u03b1 even (resp. odd) if g\u03b1 \u2282 g0\u0304 (resp.\ng\u03b1 \u2282 g1\u0304 ). Denote by \u22060 and \u22061 the sets of the even and odd roots respectively, and set\n\u2206 = \u22060 \u222a \u22061 . Let ( , ) : h\u2217 \u00d7 h\u2217 \u2212\u2192 C denote the Weyl group invariant non-degenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form on h\u2217 , where the Weyl group of g is by definition the Weyl\ngroup of g0\u0304 . A root \u03b2 will be called isotropic if (\u03b2, \u03b2) = 0. Note that all isotropic roots\nare odd.\nA Borel subalgebra of g is a maximal soluble Lie super subalgebra containing a\nBorel subalgebra of g0\u0304 . A new feature in the present context is that Borel subalgebras\nare not always conjugate under the Weyl groups. All the conjugacy classes of Borel\nsubalgebras were given in [13, pp. 51-52] [14, Proposition 1.2]. In particular, Kac\ndescribed a particularly convenient Borel subalgebra, which he called distinguished,\nfor each simple contragredient Lie superalgebra. We shall call a root system with the\nset of simple roots determined by this Borel subalgebra the distinguished root system.\nIn this case, there exists only one odd simple root.\n2.1.2. Cartan matrices and Dynkin diagrams. The precise forms of the Cartan matrices and Dynkin diagrams will be crucial in Section 3. However, there do not exist\ncanonical definitions for them in the Lie superalgebra setting, thus we spell out the\ndetails of our definitions here.\nLet \u03a0b = {\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . ., \u03b1r } be the set of simple roots of a simple contragrediant Lie\nsuperalgebra g relative to a Borel subalgebra b. The Cartan matrix and Dynkin diagram\nprovide a convenient way to describe \u03a0b . We define a Cartan matrix in the following\nway. Denote by \u0398 \u2282 {1, 2, . . ., r} the subset such that \u03b1t \u2208 \u22061 for all t \u2208 \u0398. Let lm2 be\nthe minimum of |(\u03b2, \u03b2)| for all non-isotropic \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 if g 6= D(2, 1; \u03b1). If g is D(2, 1; \u03b1),\nlet lm2 be the minimum of all |(\u03b2, \u03b2)| > 0 (\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206), which are independent of the arbitrary\n\n\f6\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nparameter \u03b1.

How-\n\never, if \u03b1t is isotropic, then at j = l22 (\u03b1t , \u03b1 j ) can be an integer of any sign or zero (except\nm\nin type D(2, 1; \u03b1)). If bi j 6= 0, we define\n(2.2)\n\nsgni j = sign of bi j .\n\nAs we shall see in Section 2.2, these signs provide the additional information required\nto recover a Cartan matrix from its Dynkin diagram.\nRemark 2.2. Our definition of the Cartan matrix differs from the usual one due to Kac\n[13]. In Kac's definition, if bss = 0, then ds = (\u03b1s , \u03b1s+k ) for the smallest k such that\nds 6= 0. Note that in our definition, none of the signs sgni j is lost.\nThe Dynkin diagram associated with (A, \u0398) consists of r nodes, which are connected\nby lines. The i-th node is coloured white if i 6\u2208 \u0398, black if i \u2208 \u0398 but \u03b1i is not isotropic,\nand grey if \u03b1i is isotropic.\nIf (A, \u0398) is of type D(2, 1; \u03b1), the Dynkin diagram is obtained by simply connecting\nthe i-th and j-th nodes by one line if ai j 6= 0 and write bi j at the line.\nIn all other cases, we join the i-th and j-th nodes by ni j lines, where\nni j = max(|ai j |, |a ji |),\n\nif aii + a j j \u2265 2;\n\nni j = |ai j |,\n\nif aii = a j j = 0.\n\nWhen the i-th and j-th nodes are not both grey, say, the i-th one is not grey, and\nconnected by more than one lines, we draw an arrow pointing to the j-th node if \u2212ai j =\n1 and pointing to the i-th node if \u2212ai j > 1.\nThe Dynkin diagrams of the simple contragredient Lie superalgebras are given in\nthe tables in Appendix A.2.\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\n2.2. Comments on Dynkin diagrams. From the Cartan matrices in our definition,\none can recover the corresponding root systems. Dynkin diagrams also uniquely represent Cartan matrices, except in the cases of osp4|2 and sl2|2 . The Dynkin diagrams\nof these superalgebras relative to the distinguished root systems are exactly the same,\nbut the two Lie superalgebras are non-isomorphic.\nThis problem can be resolved by incorporating the signs sgni j into the Dynkin diagram, e.g., by placing sgni j at the line(s) connecting two grey nodes i and j. Then the\nmodified Dynkin diagram are respectively given by\n(2.3)\n\nsl2|2 :\n\n\u2710\u2212\n\n2+\n\n\u2710\u2212\n\nosp4|2 :\n\n\u2710\n\n,\n\n2\u2212\n\n\u2710\n\n.\n\nAs we shall see, the signs enter the construction of higher order Serre relations.\nIn this paper we did not include the additional information of these signs in the\ndefinition of Dynkin diagrams, as they would make the diagrams look cumbersome.\nAlso, there is no ambiguity about the signs in all the other Dynkin diagrams.\nSimilar signs were also discussed in [27].\nRecall that if we remove a subset of vertices (i.e., nodes) and all the edges connected\nto these vertices from a Dynkin diagram of a semi-simple Lie algebra, we obtain the\nDynkin diagram of another semi-simple Lie algebra of a smaller rank. This corresponds to taking regular subalgebras. In the context Lie superalgebras, the notion of\nregular subalgebras still exists, but some explanation is required at the level of Dynkin\ndiagrams.\nDefinition 2.3. Call a sub-diagram \u0393\u2032 of a Dynkin diagram \u0393 full if for any two nodes\ni and j in \u0393\u2032 , the edges between them in \u0393, the arrows on the edges, and also the bi j\nlabels of the edges when \u0393 is of type D(2, 1; \u03b1), are all present in \u0393\u2032 .\nConsider for example the Dynkin diagram\n2\n\u2710\n\n> 2\n\n\u2745\n\u27452\n\nof F(4), which has the following full sub-diagrams beside others:\n(2.4)\n\n\u2710\n\n> 2\n\n2\n,\n\n2\n\n2.\n\nNote that none of these appears in Tables 1 and 2.\nThe reason is that the sub-matrices in the Cartan matrix of F(4) associated with\nthese full sub-diagrams are not Cartan matrices in the strict sense. The problem lies in\nthe definition of ai j when the node i is grey, which involves the number lm . The lm for\nF(4) is not the correct ones for the full sub-diagrams. By properly renormalising the\nbilinear forms on the weight spaces associated with them, the full sub-diagrams can be\ncast into the form\n\n\f8\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\n\u2710\n\n2\n\n2\n,\n\n2\n\n2,\n\nwhich are respectively Dynkin diagrams for sl3|1 and sl2|1 .\nWe call the Dynkin diagrams in Table 1 and Table 2 standard, and the ones like those\nin (2.4) non-standard.\nWe mention that if a Lie superalgebra g is contained as a regular subalgebra in\nanother Lie superalgebra, defining relations of g can in principle be extracted from\nrelations of the latter by considering sub-diagrams of Dynkin diagrams. However, this\ninvolves subtleties, as we have just discussed, and requires more care than hitherto\nexercised in the literature.\n3. P RESENTATIONS\n\nOF\n\nL IE\n\nSUPERALGEBRAS\n\nIn this section, we generalise Serre's theorem for semi-simple Lie algebras to contragredient Lie superalgebras, obtaining presentations for the Lie superalgebras in terms\nof Chevalley generators and defining relations.\n3.1. An auxiliary Lie superalgebra. We start by defining an auxiliary Lie superalgebra following the strategy of [15]. Let (A, \u0398) with A = (ai j )ri, j=1 be the Cartan matrix of\none of the simple contragredient Lie superalgebras relative to a given Borel subalgebra\nb. Let \u03a0b be the set of simple roots relative to this Borel subalgebra.\nDefinition 3.1. Let g\u0303(A, \u0398) be the Lie superalgebra generated by homogeneous generators ei , fi , hi (i = 1, 2, . . ., r), where es , fs for all s \u2208 \u0398 are odd while the rest are even,\nsubject to the following relations\n[hi , h j ] = 0,\n(3.1)\n\n[hi , e j ] = ai j e j ,\n\n[hi , f j ] = \u2212ai j f j ,\n\n[ei , f j ] = \u03b4i j hi ,\n\n\u2200i, j.\n\nLet \u00f1+ (resp. \u00f1\u2212 ) be the subalgebra generated by all ei (resp. all fi ) subject to the\nrelevant relations, and h = \u2295ri=1 Chi , the Cartan subalgebra. Then it is well known and\neasy to prove (following the reasoning of [15, \u00a71]) that g\u0303(A, \u0398) = \u00f1+ \u2295 h \u2295 \u00f1\u2212 . The\nLie superalgebra is graded g\u0303(A, \u0398) = \u2295\u03bd\u2208Q g\u0303\u03bd by Q = Z\u03a0b , with g\u03030 = h. Note hat \u00f1+\n\u03bd\n(rep. \u00f1\u2212\n\u2212\u03bd ) is zero unless \u03bd \u2208 QN , where N = {1, 2, . . .} and QN = N\u03a0b , that is,\n(3.2)\n\n\u00f1+ = \u2295\u03bd\u2208QN \u00f1+\n\u03bd,\n\n\u00f1\u2212 = \u2295\u03bd\u2208QN \u00f1\u2212\n\u2212\u03bd .\n\nLet r(A, \u0398) be the maximal Z2 -graded ideal of g\u0303(A, \u0398) that intersects h trivially.\nSet r\u00b1 = r(A, \u0398) \u2229 \u00f1\u00b1 . Then r(A, \u0398) = r+ \u2295 r\u2212 . The following fact follows from the\nmaximality of r(A, \u0398).\nLemma 3.2. Let \u03a3 = \u03a3+ \u222a \u03a3\u2212 with \u03a3\u00b1 \u2282 \u00f1\u00b1 be a subset of g\u0303(A, \u0398) consisting of homogeneous elements. If [ fi , \u03a3+ ] \u2282 C\u03a3+ and [ei , \u03a3\u2212 ] \u2282 C\u03a3\u2212 for all i, then \u03a3 \u2282 r(A, \u0398).\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nProof. The given conditions on \u03a3 imply that the ideal generated by r(A, \u0398) \u222a \u03a3 intersects h trivially, hence must be equal to r(A, \u0398) by the maximality of the latter.\n\u0003\nIn particular, if X \u00b1 \u2208 \u00f1\u00b1 satisfy [ fi , X +] = 0, and [ei , X \u2212] = 0 for all i, then they\nbelong to \u00f1\u00b1 respectively.\nLet us define the Lie superalgebra\nL(A, \u0398) :=\n\ng\u0303(A, \u0398)\n.\nr(A, \u0398)\n\nWe have the following result.\nTheorem 3.3. Let g be a finite dimensional simple contragredient Lie superalgebra, and let (A, \u0398) be the Cartan matrix of g relative to a given Borel subalgebra.\nThen L(A, \u0398) is isomorphic to g unless g = A(n, n), and in the latter case L(A, \u0398) \u223c\n=\nsln+1|n+1 .\nProof. This follows from Kac's classification [13] of the simple contragredient Lie\nsuperalgebras (see Theorem 2.1) except in the case of A(n, n). In the latter case, we\nhave det A = 0. Therefore, L(A, \u0398) contains a 1-dimensional center, and the quotient\nof L(A, \u0398) by the center is A(n, n). Hence L(A, \u0398) is isomorphic to sln+1|n+1 .\n\u0003\n3.2.

Cases (7) - (14) were not considered before in the literature.\nRemark 3.5. The Dynkin diagrams of D(2, 1) and D(2, 1; \u03b1) in their respective distinguished root systems are not among the full sub-diagrams listed above. Also, the\ndiagram (9) above is a non-standard diagram of sl3|1 (see Section 2.2).\nDenote by S+ (A, \u0398) (resp. S\u2212 (A, \u0398)) the set of all the standard and higher order\nSerre elements (if defined) which involve generators ek (resp. fk ) only. Set S(A, \u0398) =\nS+ (A, \u0398) \u222a S\u2212(A, \u0398). We have the following result.\nLemma 3.6. The set S(A, \u0398) is contained in the maximal ideal r(A, \u0398) of g\u0303.\n\n\f12\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nProof. Direct calculations show that\n[ fi , S+ (A, \u0398)] \u2282 CS+ (A, \u0398),\n\n[ei , S\u2212 (A, \u0398)] \u2282 CS\u2212 (A, \u0398),\n\n\u2200i.\n\nHence S(A, \u0398) \u2282 r(A, \u0398) by Lemma 3.2. We leave out the details of the calculations.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.7. Let s(A, \u0398) be the Z2 -graded ideal of g\u0303(A, \u0398) generated by the elements of S(A, \u0398).\nThen s(A, \u0398) \u2282 r(A, \u0398) by Lemma 3.6. Define the Lie superalgebra\ng\u0303(A, \u0398)\ng(A, \u0398) :=\n(3.3)\n.\ns(A, \u0398)\nThere exists a natural surjective Lie superalgebra map g(A, \u0398) \u2212\u2192 L(A, \u0398). We shall\nshow that it is in fact an isomorphism.\n3.2.2. Z-gradings. Let us discuss Z-gradings for the Lie supealgebras g(A, \u0398) and\nL(A, \u0398). Fix a positive integer d \u2264 r, where r is the size of A. We assign degrees to the\ngenerators of g\u0303(A, \u0398) as follows:\ndeg(h j ) = 0, \u2200 j,\n(3.4)\n\ndeg(ei ) = deg( fi ) = 0,\n\n\u2200i 6= d,\n\ndeg(ed ) = \u2212deg( fd ) = 1.\nThis introduces a Z-grading to the auxiliary Lie superalgebra g\u0303(A, \u0398), which is not\nrequired to be compatible with the Z2 -grading upon reduction modulo 2. In view of\nthe Q-grading of g\u0303(A, \u0398) and (3.2), the maximal ideal r(A, \u0398) is Z-graded. Since all\nelements in S(A, \u0398) are homogeneous with the Z-grading, s(A, \u0398) is Z-graded as well.\nThe Lie superalgebra L(A, \u0398) inherits a Z-grading from g\u0303(A, \u0398) and r(A, \u0398). Write\nL(A, \u0398) = \u2295k\u2208Z Lk . Since the roots of L(A, \u0398) are known, we have a detailed understanding of all Lk as L0 -modules.\nThe Lie superalgebra g(A, \u0398) inherits a Z-grading from g\u0303(A, \u0398) and s(A, \u0398). Write\ng(A, \u0398) = \u2295k\u2208Z gk , where gk is the homogeneous component of degree k. Note that g1\n(resp. g\u22121 ) generates gk (resp. g\u2212k ) for all k > 0. Thus if g p = 0 (resp. g\u2212p = 0) for\nsome p > 0, then gq = 0 (resp. g\u2212q = 0) for all q > p. Also each gk forms a g0 -module\nin the obvious way.\nWe have the following result.\nLemma 3.8. There exist Z-gradings for g(A, \u0398) and L(A, \u0398) determined by some d\nsuch that g0 = L0 as Lie superalgebras and gk = Lk as g0 -modules for all nonzero\nk \u2208 Z.\nThis is the key lemma needed for establishing Theorem 3.10 below. Its proof is\nelementary but very lengthy, thus we relegate it to later sections. Here we consider\nsome general properties of the Lie superalgebras g(A, \u0398) and L(A, \u0398), which will significantly simplify the proof of Lemma 3.8.\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nRecall that an anti-involution \u03c9 of a Lie superalgebra a is a linear map on a satisfying\n\u03c9([X ,Y ]) = [\u03c9(Y ), \u03c9(X )] for all X ,Y \u2208 a, and \u03c92 = ida . The Lie superalgebra g\u0303(A, \u0398)\nadmits an anti-involution defined by\n\u03c9(ei ) = fi , \u03c9( fi ) = ei , \u03c9(hi ) = hi ,\n+\nNote that \u03c9(S ) \u2282 \u2212S\u2212 \u222a S\u2212 and \u03c9(S\u2212 ) \u2282 \u2212S+ \u222a S+ , where\n\n\u2200i.\n\nS\u00b1 = S\u00b1 (A, \u0398) and \u2212S\u00b1\nare respectively the sets consisting of the negatives of the elements of S\u00b1 . Therefore,\n\u03c9 descents to an anti-involution on g(A, \u0398), which sends gk to g\u2212k for all k \u2208 Z and\nprovides a g0 -module isomorphism between g\u2212k and the dual space of gk .\nThe anti-involution of g\u0303(A, \u0398) also descends to an anti-involution of L(A, \u0398), which\nmaps Lk to L\u2212k for all k \u2208 Z, and provides an isomorphism between the L0 -module\nL\u2212k and the dual L0 -module of Lk .\nTherefore, if g0 = L0 and gk = Lk for all k > 0 as g0 -modules, the existence of the\nanti-involutions immediately implies that g\u2212k = L\u2212k for all k > 0. Hence in order to\nprove Lemma 3.8, we only need to show that it holds for all k > 0.\nThe arguments above may be summarised as follows.\nLemma 3.9. If g0 = L0 as Lie superalgebras and gk = Lk for all k > 0 as g0 -modules,\nthen Lemma 3.8 holds.\nThis result will play an essential role in the proof of Lemma 3.8.\n3.2.3. Main theorem. The following theorem is the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 3.10. The Lie superalgebra g(A, \u0398) coincides with L(A, \u0398), or equivalently,\nthe ideal s(A, \u0398) of g\u0303(A, \u0398) is equal to the maximal ideal r(A, \u0398).\nProof. Note that Lemma 3.8 immediately implies the claim. Indeed, we have already\nshown in Lemma 3.6 that s(A, \u0398) \u2282 r(A, \u0398), and this is an inclusion of Z-graded ideals\nof g\u0303(A, \u0398). If s(A, \u0398) 6= r(A, \u0398), there would exist a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism g(A, \u0398) \u2212\u2192 L(A, \u0398) with a nonzero kernel. Thus for some k, the degreek homogeneous components of L(A, \u0398) and g(A, \u0398) are not equal. This contradicts\nLemma 3.8.\n\u0003\n3.3. Presentations of Lie superalgebras.

P ROOF\n\nOF KEY LEMMA FOR DISTINGUISHED ROOT SYSTEMS\n\nThroughout this section, we assume that the Cartan matrix (A, \u0398) is associated with\nthe distinguished root system of a simple Lie superalgebra. Thus \u0398 contains only one\nelement, which we denote by s. To simplify notation, we write g\u0303(A) for g\u0303(A, \u0398), g(A)\nfor g(A, \u0398), and L(A) for L(A, \u0398)\n4.1. The proof. The proof of Lemma 3.8 will make essential use of Lemma 3.9. Define the Z-gradings for g(A) and L(A) as in Section 3.2.2 by taking d = s.\nLemma 4.1. As reductive Lie algebras, g0 = L0 .\nProof. In this case, both g0 and L0 are generated by purely even elements. Let g\u20320 =\n[g0 , g0 ] and L\u20320 = [L0 , L0 ] be the derived algebras. Then by Serre's theorem for semi\u0003\nsimple Lie algebras g\u20320 = L\u20320 . Now the claim immediately follows.\nWe now consider the g0 -modules g1 and L1 .\nRemark 4.2. For convenience, we continue to use ei , hi and fi to denote the images of\nthese elements in g(A).\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\nExamine the following relations in g(A):\n(4.1)\n\n[hi , es ] = ais es ,\n\n[ fi , es ] = 0,\n\n(adei )1\u2212ais es = 0,\n\n\u2200i 6= s.\n\nThe first two relations imply that es is a lowest weight vector of the g0 -module g1 ,\nwith weight \u03b1s . Since ais are non-positive integers for all i 6= s, by [11, Theorem 21.4],\nthe third relation implies that g1 is an irreducible finite dimensional g0 -module. The\nrelations (4.1) also hold in L(A). This immediately shows the following result.\nLemma 4.3. Both g1 and L1 are irreducible g0 -modules, and g1 = L1 .\nNote that g2 is generated by g1 , that is g2 = [g1 , g1 ]. By induction one can show that\ngk+1 = (adg1 )k (g1 ) for all k \u2265 1. If gi = 0 for some i > 1, then g j = 0 for all j \u2265 i. We\nhave the g0 -module decomposition g1 \u2297 g1 = Ss2 (g1 ) \u2295 \u22272s (g2 ), where Ss2 (g1 ) denotes\nthe second Z2 -graded symmetric power, and \u22272s (g1 ) the second Z2 -graded skew power,\nof g1 .\nRemark 4.4. Throughout the paper, we use Ssk (V ) and \u2227ks (V ) to denote the Z2 -graded\nsymmetric and skew symmetric tensors of rank k in the Z2 -graded vector space V , and\nSk (V ) and \u2227k (V ) to denote the usual symmetric and skew symmetric tensors of rank k,\nignoring the Z2 -grading of V .\nWe have the following result:\nLemma 4.5. The Lie superbracket defines a surjective g0 -map g1 \u2297g1 \u2212\u2192 g2 , X \u2297Y 7\u2192\n[X ,Y ]. The g0 -submodule Ss2 (g1 ) is in the kernel of this map, and \u22272s (g1 ) is mapped\nsurjectively onto g2 .\nProof. For any X ,Y \u2208 g1 , an element Z \u2208 g0 acts on X \u2297Y by\nZ * (X \u2297Y ) = [Z, X ] \u2297Y + X \u2297 [Z,Y ].\nThe Lie superbracket maps Z * (X \u2297 Y ) to [[Z, X ],Y ] + [X , [Z,Y ]] = [Z, [X ,Y ]]. This\nproves the first claim. The second claim follows from the Z2 -graded skew symmetry\nof the Lie superbracket.\n\u0003\nTherefore, the g0 -map \u03a8 : \u22272s (g1 ) \u2212\u2192 g2 defined by the composition\n[,]\n\n\u22272s (g1 ) \u0592\u2192 g1 \u2297 g1 \u2212\u2192 g2\nis also surjective, where the map on the left is the natural embedding. The structure of\n\u22272s (g1 ) as a g0 -module can be understood; this enables us to understand the structure\nof g2 .\nRecall that in the distinguished root systems, L2 = 0 if L(A) is of type I, and L2 6= 0\nbut L3 = 0 if L(A) is of type II. Thus in order to show that gk = Lk for all k > 0, it\nremains to prove that g2 = 0 if the Cartan matrix A is of type I, and g2 = L2 and g3 = 0\nif A is of type II. In view of Lemma 3.9, the proof of Lemma 3.8 is done once this is\naccomplished.\n\n\f18\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nThe rest of the proof will be based on a case by case study. Let us start with the type\nI Lie superalgebras.\n4.1.1. The case of slm|n . If the Cartan matrix A is that of slm|n , the Lie superalgebra\nn\ng(A) has g0 = glm \u2295 sln , and g1 \u223c\n= Cm \u2297 C up to parity change, where Cm denotes\nn\nthe natural module for glm , and C denotes the dual of the natural module for sln .\nn\nAssuming that both m and n are greater than 1. Then \u22272s (g1 ) = S2 (Cm ) \u2297 S2 (C ) \u2295\nn\n\u22272 (Cm ) \u2297 \u22272 (C ).\nThe lowest weight vectors of the irreducible submodules are respectively given by\nv(2) :=es \u2297 es ;\nv(12 ) :=es\u22121,s+2 \u2297 es,s+1 + es,s+1 \u2297 es\u22121,s+2\n\u2212 (es\u22121,s+1 \u2297 es,s+2 + es,s+2 \u2297 es\u22121,s+1 ),\nwhere s = m, and\nes,s+1 = es ,\n\nes,s+2 = [es , es+1 ],\n\nes\u22121,s+1 = [es\u22121 , es ],\n\nes\u22121,s+2 = [es\u22121 , es,s+2 ].\n\nWe have \u03a8(v(2)) = [es , es ] = 0 by one of the standard Serre relations. It follows that\nn\nthe entire irreducible g0 -submodule S2 (Cm ) \u2297 S2(C ) is mapped to zero. In particular,\nwe have\n(4.2)\n\n[es\u22121,s+2 , es,s+1 ] + [es\u22121,s+1 , es,s+2 ] = 0.\n\nThe first term of (4.2) vanishes by the higher order Serre relation; this in turn forces\nthe second term to vanish as well. Hence\n\u03a8(v(12 )) = [es\u22121,s+2 , es,s+1 ] \u2212 [es\u22121,s+1 , es,s+2 ] = 0.\nTherefore, v(12 ) is in the kernel of \u03a8, implying that the entire submodule \u22272 (Cm ) \u2297\nn\n\u22272 (C ) is mapped to zero by \u03a8. This shows that g2 = 0, and hence gk = 0 for all k \u2265 2.\nNote that if min(m, n) = 1, say, n = 1, \u22272s (g1 ) is irreducible as g0 -module and is\nequal to S2 (Cm ) \u2297C. The above proof obviously goes through but in a much simplified\nfashion.\nTherefore, we have proved that gk = Lk for all k \u2265 2 in the case L(A) = slm|n .\n4.1.2. The case of C(n + 1) with n > 1. In this case, g0 = sp2n \u2295 C and g1 = C2n . The\nZ2 -graded skew symmetric tensor \u22272s (g1 ) is an irreducible g0 -module with the lowest\nweight vector e1 \u2297 e1 . Since \u03a8(e1 \u2297 e1 ) = [e1 , e1 ] = 0 by the standard Serre relation, it\nimmediately follows that gk = 0 for all k \u2265 2.\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n19\n\n4.1.3. The case of D(m, n) with m > 2. In this case, g0 = gln \u2295 so2m , and g1 is isomorphic to Cn \u2297 C2m as g0 -module (up to parity) with en being the lowest weight vector.\nLet us first assume that n > 1. Then we have\nS2 (C2m )\n2\n2\nn\n\u2295 \u22272 (Cn ) \u2297 \u22272 (C2m ) \u2295 S2 (Cn ) \u2297 C.\n\u2227s (g1 ) = S (C ) \u2297\nC\nLowest weight vectors of the first two irreducible submodules can be explicitly constructed in exactly the same way as in the case of slm|n . The same arguments used\nthere also show that the Lie superbracket maps both submodules to zero. Hence\ng2 \u223c\n= S2 (Cn ) \u2297 C. Inspecting the roots of D(m, n) given in Appendix A.1, we can\nsee that g2 = L2 .\nLet us examine g2 in more detail. We use notation from Appendix A.1 for roots of\nthe Lie superalgebra D(m, n). Let X\u03b4i \u00b1\u03b5 p , where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 p \u2264 m, be a weight\nbasis of g1 . Then in g2 , we have\n(4.3)\n\n[X\u03b4i\u2212\u03b5 p , X\u03b4 j \u2212\u03b5q ] = [X\u03b4i +\u03b5 p , X\u03b4 j +\u03b5q ] = 0,\n[X\u03b4i+\u03b5 p , X\u03b4 j \u2212\u03b5q ] = 0,\n\n\u2200i, j, p, q,\n\n\u2200i, j, p 6= q,\n\nand there exist scalars ci j,pq such that\n[X\u03b4i\u2212\u03b5 p , X\u03b4 j +\u03b5 p ] = ci j,pq [X\u03b4i +\u03b5 p , X\u03b4 j \u2212\u03b5 p ] 6= 0,\n\n\u2200i, j, p, q.\n\nBy multiplying the elements X\u03b4i\u00b1\u03b5 p by appropriate scalars if necessary, we may assume\n[X\u03b4i \u2212\u03b5 p , X\u03b4 j +\u03b5 p ] = [X\u03b4i \u2212\u03b5q , X\u03b4 j +\u03b5q ],\n\n\u2200i, j, p, q,\n\nwhich we denote by X\u03b4i+\u03b4 j . Then the subset of X\u03b4i+\u03b4 j with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n forms a basis\nof g2 .\nNow we consider g3 . It immediately follows from (4.3) that [X\u03b4i+\u03b4 j , X\u03b4k \u00b1\u03b5 p ] = 0 for\nall k, p and i \u2264 j, that is,\n(4.4)\n\ng3 = [g1 , g2 ] = 0.\n\nHence gk = 0 for all k \u2265 3.\nWhen n = 1, the proof goes through much more simply. This completes the proof\nof Lemma 3.8 for the case of D(m, n) with m > 2.\nIn contrast to the type I case, the complication here is that g3 needs to be analysed\nseparately as g2 6= 0.\n4.1.4. The case of D(2, n). In this case, g0 = gln \u2295 sl2 \u2295 sl2 , and g1 = Cn \u2297 C2 \u2297 C2 .\nThe Z2 -graded skew symmetric rank two tensor \u22272s (g1 ) decomposes into the direct\nsum of four irreducible g0 -modules if n > 1:\n\u22272s (g1 ) =Ln(2) \u2297 L2(2) \u2297 L2(2) \u2295 Ln(1,1) \u2297 L2(2) \u2297 L2(0)\n\u2295 Ln(1,1) \u2297 L2(0) \u2297 L2(2) \u2295 Ln(2) \u2297 L2(0) \u2297 L2(0) .\nIf n = 1, then Ln(1,1) = 0, the two modules in the middle are absent.\n\n\f20\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nThe lowest weight vectors of the first three submodules can be easily worked out.\nBelow we give the explicit formulae for their images under the Lie superbracket. Let\nes;s+1 = [es , es+1 ],\n\nes;s+2 = [es , es+2 ],\n\nes\u22121;s+1 = [es\u22121 , es;s+1 ],\n\nes\u22121;s = [es\u22121 , es ],\n\nes\u22121;s+2 = [es\u22121 , es;s+2 ].\n\nThen the images of the lowest weight vectors are given by\n(4.5) [es , es ],\n\n[es\u22121;s+1 , es ] \u2212 [es\u22121;s, es,s+1 ],\n\n[es\u22121;s+2 , es ] \u2212 [es\u22121;s , es,s+2 ].\n\nWe have the Serre relation [es , es ] = 0. This implies that the entire irreducible submodule Ln(2) \u2297 L2(2) \u2297 L2(2) is mapped to zero by the Lie superbracket.\nIn the case n > 1, this in particular implies\n[es\u22121;s+1 , es ] + [es\u22121;s, es,s+1 ] = 0,\n\n[es\u22121;s+2 , es ] + [es\u22121;s , es,s+2 ] = 0.\n\nNote that [es\u22121;s+1 , es ] = 0 and [es\u22121;s+2 , es ] = 0 are the two higher order Serre relations\ninvolving es . Thus all the four terms on the left hand sides of the above equations\nshould vanish separately. It then follows that the second and third elements in (4.5) are\nzero, that is, the lowest weight vectors of the irreducible submodules Ln(1,1) \u2297L2(2) \u2297L2(0)\nand Ln(1,1) \u2297 L2(0) \u2297 L2(2) are in the kernel of the Lie superbracket. Thus both irreducible\nsubmodules are mapped to zero by the Lie superbracket. The above analysis in vacuous\nif n = 1.\nTherefore, g2 \u223c\n= Ln(2) \u2297 L2(0) \u2297 L2(0) , and this shows that g2 \u223c\n= L2 .\nTo analyse g3 , we note that equation (4.4) still holds here as can be shown by adapting the arguments in the m > 2 case. This completes the proof in this case.\n4.1.5. The case of B(m, n). When m \u2265 1, the proof is much the same as in the case of\nD(m, n) with m > 2. We omit the details.\nIf m = 0, then g0 = gln , g1 = Cn and g2 \u223c\n= L2 . Every root vector in g1 is\n= \u22272s (g1 ) \u223c\nof the form [X , es] for some positive root vector X \u2208 g0 , where s = n. Thus it follows\nfrom the relation (ades )3 (es\u22121 ) = 0 that [g1 , [es , es ]] = 0. Since [es , es ] is a g0 lowest\nweight vector of g2 , this implies g3 = 0.\nRemark 4.6. The Lie superalgebra B(0, n) is essentially the same as the ordinary Lie\nalgebra Bn . As a matter of fact, the corresponding quantum supergroup is isomorphic\nto the smash product of Uq (Bn ) with the group algebra of Zn2 [28, 18]. The usual proof\nof Serre presentations for semi-simple Lie algebras (see, e.g., [11]) works for B(0, n).\nWe gave the alternative proof here for the sake of uniformity.\n4.1.6. The case of F(4). Let us order the nodes in the Dynkin diagram from the right\nto left:\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u2710\n<\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u2710\n\n\u2710\n\n.\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n21\n\nWe\n\u0010 may express the\n\u0011 simple roots as \u03b11 = \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52 , \u03b12 = \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 , \u03b12 = \u03b53 and \u03b14 =\n1\n2 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 . The symmetric bilinear form on the weight space is defined in\nAppendix A.1, where further details about roots of F(4) are given.\nThe first three simple roots are the standard simple roots of so7 , thus g0 = so7 \u2295 gl1 .\nThe subspace g1 is an irreducible g0 -module, which has e4 as a lowest weight vector,\nand restricts to the spinor module for so7 . Now \u22272s (g1 ) decomposes into the direct\nsum of two irreducibles g0 -submodules, one of which is 1-dimensional, the other is\n35-dimensional with lowest weight vector e4 \u2297 e4 .\nThe Serre relation [e4 , e4 ] = 0 implies that the 35-dimensional submodule is in the\nkernel of the Lie superbracket, and hence g2 is 1-dimensional. A basis element for g2\nis E = [e4 , e\u03b14 +\u03b51 +\u03b52 +\u03b53 ].\nFor any weight \u03b2 of g1 , we use e\u03b2 \u2208 g1 to denote a basis vector of the associated\nweight space, and set e\u03b14 = e4 . Then we have\n(4.6)\n\n[e\u03b2 , E] = 0,\n\nfor all odd positive root \u03b2.\n\nThis is trivially true for \u03b2 = \u03b14 or \u03b14 + \u03b51 + \u03b52 + \u03b53 . For \u03b2 = \u03b14 + \u03b51 or \u03b14 + \u03b5i + \u03b5 j\n(i 6= j), we have [e\u03b2 , E] = [[e\u03b2, e\u03b14 ], e\u03b14 +\u03b51 +\u03b52 +\u03b53 ] \u2212 [e\u03b14 , [e\u03b2, e\u03b14 +\u03b51 +\u03b52 +\u03b53 ]], where both\nterms vanish as they involve images in g2 of elements in the 35-dimensional submodule\nof \u22272s (g1 ). Therefore, gk = {0} for all k \u2265 3.\n4.1.7. The case of G(3). In this case, g0 is isomorphic to the reductive Lie algebra\nG2 \u2295 gl1 , and g1 is an irreducible g0 -module which restricts to the 7-dimensional\nirreducible G2 -module. The Z2 -graded skew symmetric tensor \u22272s (g1 ) decomposes\ninto the direct sum L(2\u03b11 ) \u2295 L(0) of two irreducible g0 -submodules. The submodule\nL(2\u03b11 ) has e1 \u2297 e1 as lowest weight vector, thus its image under the Lie superbracket\nis zero by the Serre relation [e1 , e1 ] = 0. The submodule L(0) is 1-dimensional. Since\nthe Lie superbracket maps \u22272s (g1 ) surjectively to g2 , we immediately conclude that\ndim g2 = 1.\nLet X = e2\u03b12 +\u03b13 be the root vector of G2 \u2282 g associated with the positive root 2\u03b12 +\n\u03b13 . Then e+ := [X , [X , e1]] is the highest weight vector of g1 as a g0 -module. Since g2\nis one-dimensional, it must be spanned by E = [e1 , e+ ].\nIf e\u03b2 \u2208 g1 is a weigh vector not proportional to e1 or e+ , both [e\u03b2 , e1 ] and [e\u03b2 , e+ ]\nvanish since they lie in the image of L(2\u03b11 ) \u2282 \u22272s (g1 ) under the Lie superbracket.\nHence [e\u03b2 , E] = 0. We also have [e+ , e+ ] = 0, and the Serre relation [e1 , e1 ] = 0. Thus\n[e1 , E] = [e+ , E] = 0. Therefore, [g1 , E] = 0, which implies gk = {0}, for all k \u2265 3.\n4.1.8. The case of D(2, 1; \u03b1). We have g0 = sl2 \u2295 sl2 \u2295 gl1 , and g1 \u223c\n= C2 \u2297 C2 . The\ntensor \u22272s (g1 ) decomposes into the direct sum of two irreducible g0 -submodules,\n\u22272s (g1 ) = L(2;2) \u2295 L(12 ;12 ) ,\n\nL(2;2) = L(2) \u2297 L(2) ,\n\nL(12 ;12 ) = L(12 ) \u2297 L(12 ) .\n\nThe notation here only reflects the sl2 \u2295 sl2 -module structure, as there is no need to\nspecify the gl1 -action explicitly (see Remark 4.7 below).\n\n\f22\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nWe have dim L(2;2) = 9 and dim L(12 ;12 ) = 1. The lowest weight vector for L(2;2) is\nv(2) = e1 \u2297 e1 . Let\ne\u2212\u2212 = e1 ,\n\ne+\u2212 = [e1 , e2 ],\n\ne\u2212+ = [e1 , e3 ],\n\ne++ = [e+\u2212 , e3 ],\n\nv(12 ) = e\u2212\u2212 \u2297 e++ + e++ \u2297 e\u2212\u2212 \u2212 e+\u2212 \u2297 e\u2212+ \u2212 e\u2212+ \u2297 e+\u2212 .\nThen the vector v(12 ) spans L(12 ;12 ) .\nThe Lie superbracket maps L(2;2) to zero because [e1 , e1 ] = 0. Note that [e\u2212\u2212 , e++ ] +\n[e+\u2212 , e\u2212+ ] belongs to the image of L(2;2) , thus is zero. Hence g2 is spanned by E =\n[e\u2212\u2212 , e++ ]. Now it is easy to show that [E, g1 ] = 0.\nRemark 4.7. This proof is essentially the same as that in the case of D(2, 1), except for\nthat the gl1 subalgebra of g0 acts on g1 by different scalars in the two cases. However,\nthis scalar is not important in the proof of Lemma 3.8, and that is the reason why we\ndid not specify it explicitly.\n4.2. Comments on the proof. Let us recapitulate the proof of Lemma 3.8 in the distinguished root systems.\n(1) By Lemma 3.9, the proof of Lemma 3.8 is reduced to showing that the parabolic subalgebras g(A)\u22650 and L(A)\u22650 are the same.\n(2) The elements {hs } \u222a {hi , ei , fi | i 6= s} and those defining relations of g(A)\nobeyed by them give a Serre presentation for the reductive Lie algebra g0 .\nThen it essentially follows from Serre's theorem that g0 = L0 , see Lemma 4.1.\n(3) Given item (2), it suffices to show that g(A)>0 = \u2295k>0 gk and L(A)>0 = \u2295k>0 Lk\nare isomorphic as g0 -modules.\n(4) Equation (4.1) gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for g1 to be a finite\ndimensional irreducible g0 -module with lowest weight \u03b1s , hence g1 = L1 as\ng0 -modules.\n(5) The standard and higher order Serre relations involving es are conditions imposed on g0 -lowest weight vectors of [g1 , g1 ], which are the necessary and sufficient to guarantee that g2 = L2 .\n(6) The fact that g3 = 0 follows (trivially in the type I case) from the result on g2\nand graded skew symmetry of the Lie superbracket, thus no additional relations\nare required. The vanishing of g3 implies that for all k \u2265 3, gk = 0, and hence\ngk = Lk .\nIn non-distinguished root systems, one can still prove Lemma 3.8 by following a\nsimilar strategy, as we shall see in the next section. However, there are important\ndifferences in several aspects.\nThere are many such Z-gradings as defined in Section 3.2.2 for the Lie superalgebras\ng(A, \u0398) and L(A, \u0398). This works to our advantage.\nGiven any such Z-grading g(A, \u0398) = \u2295k\u2208Z gk , the degree zero subspace g0 forms a\nLie superalgebra, which is not an ordinary Lie in general. Thus the requirement that\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n23\n\ng1 be an irreducible g0 -module is much more difficult to implement, and usually leads\nto unfamiliar higher order Serre relations.\nIn general g3 6= 0. In order for gk to be equal to Lk for k \u2265 3, higher order Serre\nrelations are needed at degree k \u2265 3.\n5. P ROOF\n\nOF KEY LEMMA FOR NON - DISTINGUISHED ROOT SYSTEMS\n\nIn this section we prove Lemma 3.8 in non-distinguished root systems by following\na similar strategy as that in Section 4. In particular, Lemma 3.9 will be used in an\nessential way.\nAssume that the Cartan matrix A is of size r \u00d7r. Fix a positive integer d \u2264 r, we consider the corresponding Z-gradings for g(A, \u0398) and L(A, \u0398) defined in Section 3.2.2.\nWe shall first establish that g0 = L0 . Since the roots of L(A, \u0398) are known explicitly\n(see Appendix A.1), we have a complete understanding of the g0 -module structure of\nevery Lk . Thus once we have a description of the weight spaces of each gk as g0 module for all k > 0, an easy comparison with the root spaces of Lk will enable us to\nprove the key lemma.\nRemark 5.1. In the proof of Lemma 3.8 given below, we shall only describe the weight\nspaces of gk (k > 0), and leave out the easy step of comparing them with those of Lk in\nmost cases.\nFor convenience, we introduce the parity map p : {1, 2, . . ., r} \u2212\u2192 {0, 1} such that\np(i) = 1 if i \u2208 \u0398 and p(i) = 0 otherwise. Then ei and fi are odd if p(i) = 1, and even\nif p(i) = 0.\n5.1. Proof in type A. We use induction on the rank r together with the help of Lemma\n3.9 to prove Lemma 3.8 and Theorem 3.11.\nIf r = 2, the Dynkin diagram in the non-distinguished root system has two grey\nnodes. In this case, there exists no relation between e1 and e2 , and [e1 , e2 ] is another\npositive root vector. Note that [e1 , [e1 , e2 ]] = 0 and [e2 , [e1 , e2 ]] = 0 by the graded skew\nsymmetry of the Lie superbracket. Thus Lemma 3.8 is valid and g(A, \u0398) = L(A, \u0398)\nWhen r > 2, we take d = r. Then g\u20320 = [g0 , g0 ] is a special linear superalgebra of\nrank r \u2212 1 by the induction hypothesis, and thus g0 is a general linear superalgebra.\nDefine the following elements of g0 :\n(5.1)\n\nXi j = adei * * * ade j\u22122 (e j\u22121 ),\n\ni < j \u2264 r,\n\nwhere X j, j+1 = e j . In view of the general linear superalgebra structure of g0 , we\nconclude that g1 is isomorphic to the irreducible g0 -module with lowest weight \u03b1r\n(which is in fact the natural module possibly upon a parity change) if and only if\n[Xik , [X jr , er ]] = 0,\n\nj 6= k.\n\nBy using the g0 -action, we can show that these conditions are equivalent to the relation\n(5.2)\n\n[er\u22121 , [[er\u22122, er\u22121 ], er ]] = 0\n\n\f24\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nand the relevant relations in (3.1). For p(r \u2212 1) = 1, (5.2) is a higher order Serre\nr-2\n\nrelation associated with the sub-diagram \u00d7\nIf p(r \u2212 1) = 0, it can be derived from\n\nr-1\n\n2\n\nr\n\n\u00d7 with sgnr\u22122,r\u22121 = \u2212sgnr\u22121,r .\n\n[er\u22121 , [er\u22121 , er ]] = 0,\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhich is a standard Serre relation.\nConsider \u22272s g1 , which is an irreducible g0 -module. The lowest weight vector is\ner \u2297 er ,\n\nif p(r) = 1,\n\nor\n\ner \u2297 [er\u22121 , er ] \u2212 [er\u22121 , er ] \u2297 er ,\n\nif p(r) = 0.\n\nThus g2 = 0 if and only if\n[er , er ] = 0, if p(r) = 1, or\n(5.4)\n[er , [er , er\u22121 ]] = 0, if p(r) = 0,\nboth of which are standard Serre relations. This proves that Lemma 3.8, and hence\nTheorem 3.10, are valid at rank r.\nRemark 5.2. The proof presented here includes an alternative proof for Serre's theorem\nin the case of sln . This can be generalised to all finite dimensional simple Lie algebras.\nIn particular, the proof for the other classical Lie algebras can be extracted from the\nnext two sections.\n5.2. Proof in type B. Consider the first Dynkin diagram of type B in Table 2, where\nthe last (that is, r-th) node is white, and take d = r. In this case, g0 is a general linear\nsuperalgebra, and we have already obtained a Serre presentation for it in Section 5.1.\nWe require g1 be isomorphic to the irreducible g0 -module with lowest weight \u03b1r ,\nwhich is in fact the natural module for g0 . This is achieved by relations formally the\nsame as (5.2) or (5.3).\nAs g0 -module, g2 is isomorphic to \u22272s g1 , which is irreducible with the lowest weight\nvector E := [er , [er , er\u22121 ]]. Now g3 = 0 if and only if [E, g1 ] = 0. This in particular\nrequires that\n(5.5)\n\n(ader )3 (er\u22121 ) = 0.\n\nWe shall show that this in fact is the necessary and sufficient condition.\nIf p(r \u2212 1) = 1, then [E, [er\u22121 , er ]] = 0 trivially since [er\u22121 , er\u22121 ] = 0 in g0 . For K =\n[er\u22122 , [er\u22121 , er ]], we also have [K, E] = 0. This follows from [K, er\u22121] = 0, which is one\nof the higher order Serre relations associated with a sub-diagram of type A. Applying\nader to it twice and using (5.5), we obtain the desired relation. These relations imply\nthat [X , E] = 0 for all X \u2208 g1 in this case. If p(r \u2212 1) = 0, the fact that [X , E] = 0, for\nall X \u2208 g1 , follows from\n[[er\u22121 , er ], [[er\u22121, er ], er ]] = 0,\nwhich can be derived from (5.5).\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n25\n\nThe other Dynkin diagram (where the last node is black) can be treated in essentially\nthe same way. We omit the details.\n5.3. Proof in types C and D. The Dynkin diagrams of type C formally have the same\nforms as two of the Dynkin diagrams of D. The only difference is in the numbers of\ngrey nodes, see Remark A.1. This enables us to treat both types of Lie superalgebras\nsimultaneously.\n5.3.1. Case 1. Consider the Dynkin diagram\n\u00d7 ... \u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7<\n\n\u2710\n\n.\nWe label the nodes from left to right, thus r-the node is the one at the right end. Set\nd = r, then g0 is a general linear superalgebra.\nAs a g0 -module, g1 is generated by er . We require it be isomorphic to the irreducible\nmodule L\u03b1r with lowest weight \u03b1r . Appendix B.2 describes the structure of the generalised Verma module V \u03b1r with lowest weight \u03b1r and the irreducible quotient L\u03b1r .

Here Xir are elements of g0 defined by (5.1). The conditions (5.6) are equivalent to\n(5.7)\n\n[er\u22121 , [er\u22121 , [er\u22121 , er ]]] = 0,\n\nif er\u22121 is even,\n\n[Xr\u22122,r , [Xr\u22122,r , [er\u22121 , er ]]] = 0,\n\nif er\u22121 , er\u22122 are both odd,\n\n[Xr\u22123,r , [Xr\u22122,r , [er\u22121 , er ]]] = 0,\n\nif er\u22121 is odd, er\u22122 is even\n\nbecause of the g0 -action. Here Remark B.1 is also in force.\nNote that the different situations where the relations apply are mutually exclusive.\nThe first relation is a standard Serre relation. The second and third are higher order\nSerre relations respectively associated with the sub-diagrams\n\u2710\n2< \u2710.\n\u00d7\nor\nRecall that g2 is the image of \u22272s g1 under the Lie superbracket. As g0 -module, \u22272s g1\nis irreducible with the lowest weight vector er \u2297 [er\u22121 , er ] \u2212 [er\u22121 , er ] \u2297 er . Thus g2 = 0\nif and only if\n2\n\n(5.8)\n\n2<\n\n\u2710\n\n[er , [er , er\u22121 ]] = 0.\n\nThis is again a standard Serre relation.\n5.3.2. Case 2.

We have the Dynkin diagram of osp2|4 (resp. osp4|2 )\nif p(1) = 0 (resp. p(1) = 1). Label by 1 the node marked by \u00d7, and take d = 1.

Let b0 be the Borel subalgebra of g0\ngenerated by f2 , f3 and all hi , and define the lowest weight Verma module V \u03b11 :=\nU (g0 ) \u2297U(b\u2212 ) C\u03b11 for g0 , where C\u03b11 is the irreducible b0 -module with lowest weight\n0\n\u03b11 . Direct computations show that the maximal submodule M\u03b11 is generated by the\nvector (e2 e3 \u2212 e3 e2 ) \u2297 1. The irreducible quotient L\u03b11 is four dimensional, with a basis\nconsisting of the images of 1 \u2297 1, e2 \u2297 1, e3 \u2297 1, and [e2 , e3 ] \u2297 1. Its restriction to osp2|2\nis the natural module.\nWe need g1 \u223c\n= L\u03b11 , possibly up to a parity change depending on the parity of e1 .\nFrom the description of V \u03b11 and M\u03b11 above, we see that the necessary and sufficient\nconditions are the relevant quadratic relations involving e1 in (3.1), and\n(5.9)\n\n[e2 , [e3 , e1 ]] \u2212 [e3, [e2 , e1 ]] = 0.\n\nNote that this is a higher order Serre relation associated with the sub-diagram (6) given\nin Theorem 3.11.\nTo proceed further, we need to specify the parity of e1 .\nIf e1 is even, the Lie superalgebra L(A, \u0398) is osp2|4 . Now \u22272s g1 is the direct sum\nof a seven dimensional indecomposable g0 -submodule and a one dimensional g0 submodule. The seven dimensional submodule is generated by the two lowest weight\nvectors\ne1 \u2297 [e2 , e1 ] \u2212 [e2 , e1 ] \u2297 e1 , e1 \u2297 [e3 , e1 ] \u2212 [e3 , e1 ] \u2297 e1 ,\nand the one dimensional submodule by\n[e2 , e1 ] \u2297 [e3 , e1 ] + [e3 , e1 ] \u2297 [e2 , e1 ] + e1 \u2297 [[e2 , e3 ], e1 ] \u2212 [[e2, e3 ], e1 ] \u2297 e1 .\nIn this case, we need g2 to be isomorphic to a one dimensional g0 -module with weight\n2\u03b11 +\u03b12 +\u03b13 . Thus the seven dimensional indecomposable submodule of \u22272s g1 is sent\nto zero by the Lie superbracket, or equivalently,\n(5.10)\n\n[e1 , [e1 , e2 ]] = 0,\n\n[e1 , [e1 , e3 ]] = 0,\n\nwhich are standard Serre relations. The image of the one dimensional submodule is\ng2 , which is spanned by\n[[e1 , e2 ], [e1 , e3 ]] \u2212 [e1 , [e1 , [e2 , e3 ]]] = \u2212[[e1 , e2 ], [e1, e3 ]],\nwhere (5.10) is used to obtain the identity. By using (5.9) and (5.10), one can easily\nshow that [g2 , g1 ] = 0, and hence g3 = 0.\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n27\n\nIf e1 is odd, the Lie superalgebra L(A, \u0398) is osp4|2 . By dimension counting, we\nneed g2 = 0. Now \u22272s g1 is also a direct sum of a seven dimensional indecomposable\ng0 -submodule and a one dimensional submodule. Given the condition [e1 , e1 ] = 0, the\nseven dimensional submodule vanishes automatically under the Lie superbracket, and\nthe image of the one dimensional submodule is spanned by [[e1 , e2 ], [e1 , e3 ]]. Taking the\nLie superbraket of e1 with both sides of (5.9), we obtain [[e1, e2 ], [e1, e3 ]] = 0. Hence\ng2 = 0.\nNow assume r \u2265 4. We take d = r \u2212 3, then g0 is the direct sum of a general linear\nsuperalgebra and osp4|2 or osp2|4 .\nIf er\u22122 is even, the condition that g1 is an irreducible g0 -module of lowest weight\n\u03b1r\u22123 is given by the relevant relations in (3.1),\n[er\u22122 , [er\u22122 , er\u22123 ]] = 0,\nand also\n(5.11)\n\n[er\u22124 , [er\u22124, er\u22123 ]] = 0,\n\nif p(r \u2212 4) = 0,\n\n[er\u22124 , [er\u22125, [er\u22124 , er\u22123 ]]] = 0,\n\nif p(r \u2212 4) = 1.\n\nAs g0 -module, \u22272s g1 is the direct sum of three irreducibles.

Let E = [[er\u22123, er\u22122 ], er\u22121] and E \u2032 = [[er\u22123, er\u22122 ], er ]. Then at least one of\nthe vectors [X , E] and [X , E \u2032] vanishes for any X \u2208 g1 .\nLet v denote a lowest weight vector of g2 . We can take v = [E, E \u2032 ] if er\u22123 is even,\nand v = [[er\u22124 , E], E \u2032] if er\u22123 is odd. Then by Remark 5.3, we have [v, X ] = 0 for any\nX \u2208 g1 . Hence g3 = 0.\nIf er\u22122 is odd, the condition that g1 is an irreducible g0 -module of lowest weight\n\u03b1r\u22123 translates into the relations (5.11),\n[er\u22122 , [[er\u22122, er\u22121 ], er\u22123 ]] = 0,\n[er\u22122 , [[er\u22122, er ], er\u22123 ]] = 0,\nplus the relevant relations in (3.1). Here we have used some facts about generalised\nVerma modules for osp4|2 .\nAs g0 -module, \u22272s g1 is again a direct sum of three irreducibles. One of them restricts\nto a direct sum of one dimensional osp4|2 -modules, and g2 is isomorphic to it. The\nother two irreducibles are both mapped to zero by the Lie superbracket. The necessary\nand sufficient condition for this to happen is still (5.12).\n\n\f28\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nNote that Remark 5.3 remains valid in the present case if we define E and E \u2032 in the\nsame way. Let v = [E, E \u2032 ] if er\u22123 is odd, and v = [[er\u22124 , E], E \u2032 ] if er\u22123 is even. Then v\nis a nonzero lowest weight vector of g2 . It follows from Remark 5.3 that [v, X ] = 0 for\nany X \u2208 g1 . Hence g3 = 0.\n5.3.3. Case 3.

This forces r \u2265 4.\nThis case is quite easy, thus we shall be brief. We choose d to be the largest integer\nsuch that p(d) = 1. Then g0 is the direct sum of a general linear superalgebra and an\neven dimensional orthogonal Lie algebra.\nFrom Section 5.1, we see that the necessary and sufficient conditions for ed (which\nmust be odd) to generate an irreducible g0 -module are the relevant relations in (3.1) and\nthe higher order Serre relation involving ed associated with the following sub-diagram\nd-1\n\nd\n\n2\n\u00d7 2\nof the Dynkin diagram if p(d \u2212 1) = 1. Note that if d = 2, this becomes\nvacuous.\nAs g0 -module, g1 is the tensor product of the natural modules VA and VD respectively\nfor the general linear superalgebra and orthogonal algebra contained in g0 . Here VD is\npurely even, and the grading of VA gives\n\u0001 rise to the grading of g1 .\nNow \u22272s g1 \u223c\n= \u22272s (VA ) \u2297 S2 (VD )/C \u2295 Ss2 (VA ) \u2297 \u22272 (VD ) \u2295 \u22272s (VA ) \u2297 C as g0 -module.\nThe images of the first two irreducibles under the Lie superbracket are set to zero by\nthe relation [ed , ed ] = 0 and the higher order Serre relation(s) associated with the subd-1\n\nd\n\n2\n\u2710. Note that if d < r \u2212 2, there is only one such\ndiagram(s) of the form \u00d7\ndiagram, but there are two if d = r \u2212 2, as the last node can be (r \u2212 1) or r. We have\ng2 \u223c\n= \u22272s (VA ) \u2297 C.\nOne can show that [g2 , g1 ] = 0 by using the same arguments as those in Section 4.1.3\nand Section 4.1.4, thus g3 = 0.\n\n5.4. Proof in type F(4). Now we turn to F(4), which is considerably more complicated than the other type of Lie superalgebras.\n5.4.1. Case 1.

The standard Serre relations plus the relevant\nrelations in (3.1) are the necessary and sufficient conditions rendering the g0 -module\ng1 irreducible. We have g1 \u223c\n= C2 \u2297 C3 up to a parity change.\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n29\n\nAs g0 -module, \u22272s g1 is a direct sum of two irreducibles. The condition [e2 , e2 ] = 0\nforces one of the irreducibles to be in the kernel of the map \u22272s g1 \u2212\u2192 g2 . Thus g2 is an\nirreducible g0 -module generated by the lowest weight vector E = [[e1 , e2 ], [e2, e3 ]]. We\nhave g2 = C \u2297 \u22272 (C3 ).\nNow g3 = [g2 , g1 ] \u223c\n= C2 \u2297 C with a basis consisting of vectors [E, [e2 , [e3 , e4 ]]] and\n[E, [E \u2032 , e4 ]], where E \u2032 = [e1 , [e2 , e3 ]]. One immediately sees that\n[g3 , e2 ] = C[E, [E, e4]],\n= C \u2297 C3 .\n\nwhich generates g4\nTo consider g5 , we only need to look at [g4 , g1 ]. If X \u2208 g1 is any lowest weight vector\nfor sl2 \u2282 g0 , the higher order Serre relation associated with the Dynkin diagram (see\ndiagram (7) in Theorem 3.11) renders [g4 , X ] = 0. Since the sl2 subalgebra of g0 acts\ntrivially on g4 , it follows that [g4 , g1 ] = 0, that is, g5 = 0.\n5.4.2. Case 2.

The relevant relations\nin (3.1) and standard Serre relations guarantee that e2 generates an irreducible g0 module, which is isomorphic to the tensor product C2 \u2297 C4 of the natural modules for\ngl2 and sp4 up to a parity change.\nNow \u22272s g1 decomposes into the direct sum of three irreducible g0 -modules,\nwhich\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nare respectively isomorphic to S (C ) \u2297 S (C ), \u2227 (C ) \u2297 \u2227 (C )/C and \u2227 (C2 ) \u2297\nC.

The\npresentation for sl1|3 involves no higher order Serre relation. We have g0 = gl1|3 .\nLet p be the lower triangular maximal parabolic subalgebra of g0 with Levi subal0\ngebra l := gl3 \u2295 gl1 . Let L\u03b14 = Cv0 be the 1-dimensional p-module with lowest weight\n\u03b14 , which is assume to be a purely odd superspace.

To avoid the laborious task of determining\nthe indecomposable submodules, we simply examine the l lowest weight vectors in\n\u22272s L\u03b14 . Of particular importance to us are the vectors\nz1 :=v0 \u2297 v0 ;\nz2 :=e3 v0 \u2297 [e2 , e3 ]e3 v0 \u2212 [e2 , e3 ]e3 v0 \u2297 e3 v0 ;\nz3 :=v0 \u2297 e3 v0 \u2212 e3 v0 \u2297 v0 ;\nw1 :=v0 \u2297 [e2 , e3 ]e3 v0 + [e2 , e3 ]e3 v0 \u2297 v0 ;\nw2 :=v0 \u2297 [e1 , [e2 , e3 ]][e2, e3 ]e3 v0 \u2212 [e1 , [e2 , e3 ]][e2 , e3 ]e3 v0 \u2297 v0 .\nThe space of l-lowest weight vectors of \u22272s L\u03b14 is spanned by w1 , w2 and the llowest weight vectors in the g0 -submodule M generated by z1 and z2 . It is important to\nobserve that w1 and w2 are not in M, but w1 \u2208 U (g0 )w2 . Furthermore, one can verify\nthat \u22272s L\u03b14 /M is multiplicity free with the set of weights \u2206+\n2.\nNow we take v0 = e4 and require p act on it by the adjoint action. Then g1 = L\u03b14 .\nWe require that the Lie superbracket maps z1 and z2 to zero. This leads to the following\nrelations:\n(5.16)\n\n[e4 , e4 ] = 0;\n[[e3 , e4 ], [[e3, e4 ], [e2, e3 ]]] = 0.\n\nUnder the first condition, the Lie superbracket automatically maps z3 to zero.

By considering the possible l-lowest weight vectors, we can\nshow that [g1 , g2 ] = 0, thus g3 = 0.\nNow the proof of Lemma 3.8 in this case is completed by comparing the weights in\n(5.14) and (5.15) with the roots in L1 and L2 .\n5.4.4.

The presentation of osp2|4 relative to the Dynkin\ndiagram\n\u2710\n2 \u27452\n\nhas been constructed, thus the defining relations among ei , fi , hi for i > 1 are all known.\nThe parabolic subalgebra of osp2|4 defined in Appendix B.1 together with the ideal gl1\nform a parabolic of g0 . Then e1 spans a 1-dimensional module for this parabolic, which\ninduces a generalised Verma module V \u03b11 of lowest weight type for g0 . The structure\nof V \u03b11 can be understood by using results of Section B.1. In particular, imposing the\ncondition (B.1), which in the present case reads\n(5.17)\n\n[e2 , [[e2 , e3 ], e1 ]] = 0,\n\nsends V \u03b11 to the irreducible quotient, which is g1 . Note that (5.17) is a higher order Serre relation associated with diagram (9) in Theorem 3.11. It is a non-standard\ndiagram of sl1|3 .\nNow g1 forms is 10-dimensional. A basis for it can be deduced from Section B.1.\nFor every vector b in this basis, we have [b, e1] = 0. This holds trivially for most basis\nvectors, but for b = [e2 , [[[e1 , e2 ], e3 ], e4 ]], we have\n[e1 , b] = [[[e1 , e2 ], e3 ], [[e1 , e2 ], e4 ]]\n1\n= (ade1 )2 [[e2 , e3 ], [e2, e4 ]].\n2\nOne can deduce from the defining relations for osp2|4 that [[e2 , e3 ], [e2 , e4 ]] = 0, hence\n[b, e1 ] = 0. This implies that the commutator of e1 with all the remaining basis vectors\nare all zero. Therefore, g2 = [g1 , g1 ] = 0.\n5.4.5. Case 5.

The Verma module of lowest weight type for g0 generated by e4\ncontains the primitive vector 2[e2 , [e3 , e4 ]]\u22123[[e2 , e3 ], e4 ], which generates the maximal\nsubmodule. Thus the higher order Serre relation\n(5.18)\n\n2[e2 , [e3 , e4 ]] \u2212 3[[e3, e2 ], e4 ] = 0,\n\nassociated with diagram (10) in Theorem 3.11, is all that is needed to guarantee that g1\nis an irreducible g0 -module. This module is typical relative to the distinguished Borel\nsubalgebra, and has dimension 8.\nRestricted to a module for gl3 \u2282 g0 , the even subspace of g1 is the direct sum of the\nnatural gl3 -module and a 1-dimensional module, while the odd subspace is the direct\nsum of the dual natural module (twisted by a scalar) and a 1-dimensional module.\nNow consider [g1 , g1 ]. We can easily work out its decomposition into irreducible gl3 submodules. The corresponding gl3 lowest weight vectors can be worked out, which\ninclude the following vectors:\n\u00012\n[e2 , e2 ],\nad[e2 ,e4 ] [e2 , e1 ], [[e2 , e4 ], [e3 , e4 ]].\nIt follows from the higher order Serre relation (5.18) that\n[[e2 , e4 ], [e3 , e4 ]] = 0.\nNow we impose the relations\n[e2 , e2 ] = 0,\n\nad[e2,e4 ]\n\n\u00012\n\n[e2 , e1 ] = 0,\n\nwhere the first is a standard Serre relation, and the second is a higher order Serre\nrelations associated with\n1\n\n\u2710\n\n2\n\n> 2\n\n4\n\n2.\n\nUnder these conditions, all other gl3 lowest vectors in [g1 , g1 ] vanish, except\n\u00012\nad[e2,e4 ] e1 , [[e3 , e4 ], [[e1, e2 ], [e2 , e4 ]]],\n\nwhere the first one is actually a g0 lowest weight vector. It generates an 4-dimensional\nirreducible g0 -module containing the second vector. This module is isomorphic to the\ndual of the natural g0 -module twisted by a scalar. This gives us g2 = [g1 , g1 ]. We can\nfurther show that [g2 , e4 ] = 0, hence g3 = 0.\n5.5. Proof in type G(3).\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n33\n\n5.5.1. Case 1.

Denote by v0 the lowest weight vector, which is\nassumed to be even. Then the maximal submodule of V \u03b13 is generated by e1 v0 and\ne2 [e1 , e2 ]3 v0 . The irreducible quotient L\u03b13 is multiplicity free and has weights\n\u03b13 + k(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ),\n\nk = 0, 1, 2, 3,\n\n\u03b13 + p(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) + \u03b12 , p = 0, 1, 2.\nIn fact L\u03b13 is isomorphic to the third Z2 -graded symmetric power of the natural module for g0 tensored with a 1-dimensional module. Thus \u22272s L\u03b13 is completely reducible;\nit is the direct sum of two irreducibles.\nNow we take v0 to be e3 , and let g0 act on it by the adjoint action. Then the generators\n\u00013\nof the maximal submodule of V \u03b13 in this case are ad[e1 ,e2 ] [e2 , e3 ] and [e1 , e3 ].

We require that this submodule be in the kernel of the Lie\nsuperbracket. This leads to the standard Serre relation [e3 , [e3 , e2 ]] = 0.\nThe other irreducible submodule of \u22272s g1 is mapped surjectively onto g2 . A lowest\n\u00012\nweight vector of g2 is given by X := ade3 ad[e1 ,e2 ] [e2 , e3 ].

This leads to\n[[e2 , e1 ], [e3, [e2 , e1 ]] \u2212 [[e2, e3 ], [[e1 , e1 ], e2 ]] = 0,\nwhich is one of the higher order Serre relations associated with the Dynkin diagram\n(see diagram (12) in Theorem 3.11). Therefore, g2 \u223c\n= L2\u03b11 and has a basis\n[e1 , e1 ],\n\n[[e1 , e1 ], e2 ],\n\n[e3 , [[e1 , e1 ], e2 ]],\n\n[[e2 , e3 ], [[e1, e1 ], e2 ]].\n\nNow we consider [g2 , g1 ]. One can easily see that (ade1 )3 e2 is a g0 lowest weight\nvector. We require that the g0 -submodule generated by it be zero, hence we have the\nstandard Serre relation\n(ade1 )3 e2 = 0.\nThis leaves g3 = [g2 , g1 ] to be an indecomposable g0 -module cyclically generated by\nthe lowest weight vector [[e1, [e2 , e3 ]], [[e1, e1 ], e2 ]], which is 7-dimensional and multiplicity free. One can easily write down a basis for this module. We should remark that\nno g0 lowest weight vector in g3 is annihilated by all fi for i = 1, 2, 3.\nOne can show by direct computations that [e1 , g3 ] = 0 and [[e1 , e1 ], g2 ] = 0. Hence\ng4 = 0.\nAn inspection of the weight spaces of gi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3 shows that they agree with\nthose of Li for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3. This completes the proof in this case.\n5.5.3.

Then g1 is an irreducible\ng0 -module with lowest weight \u03b13 , which is isomorphic to the third Z2 -graded symmetric power of the natural module for g0 twisted by a scalar. It has 3 odd and 4 even\ndimensions. A basis for g1 is given by\ne3 ,\n\n[e1 , e3 ],\n\n[[e1 , e2 ], e3 ],\n\n[e1 , [e1 , e3 ]],\n\n[e2 , e3 ],\n\n[[e1 , e2 ], [e1 , e3 ]],\n\n[[e1, e2 ], [e1, [e1 , e3 ]]].\n\nThe rest of the analysis is similar to Section 5.5.1. Now \u22272s g1 is the direct sum of\ntwo irreducible g0 -submodules. The images of theirs lowest weight vectors in [g1 , g1 ]\nare repectively [e3 , e3 ] and E = [[e1 , e3 ], [e1, e3 ]]. Both generate typical g0 -submodules,\nwhich respectively have dimensions 20 and 4. The standard Serre relation [e3 , e3 ] = 0\nremoves the 20-dimensional submodule, thus g2 is the 4-dimensional irreducible g0 module generated by E.\nWe can also show that g3 = 0 without imposing further relations. Inspecting the\nweights of g1 and g2 , we see that the claim of Lemma 3.8 indeed holds.\n5.6. Proof in type D(2, 1; \u03b1). The Dynkin diagrams having only one grey node can\nbe treated in exactly the same way as for the distinguished root system, thus we shall\nconsider only the diagram with three gray nodes here. Set d = 3, then g0 = gl2|1 . The\ng0 Verma module of lowest weight type generated by e3 contains the primitive vector\n\u03b1[e1 , [e2 , e3 ]] + (1 + \u03b1)[e2, [e1 , e3 ]],\nwhich in fact generates the maximal submodule. The higher order Serre relation requires this vector to be zero. This is equivalent to taking the irreducible quotient of the\nVerma module, and we obtain g1 . A basis for g1 is\ne3 ,\n\n[e1 , e3 ],\n\n[e2 , e3 ],\n\n[e1 , [e2 , e3 ]].\n\nAn easy computation using the higher order Serre relation shows that [g1 , e3 ] = 0.\nHence g2 = 0. A quick inspection on the weights of g1 shows that Lemma 3.8 indeed\nholds in this case.\n6. R EMARKS\n\nON AFFINE\n\nL IE\n\nSUPERALGEBRAS\n\nWe wish to mention that the generalisation of the method to affine Lie superalgebras is in principle straightforward conceptually. Consider, for example, the untwisted\naffine superalgebra \u011d of a contragredient Lie superalgebra g. We want to present \u011d\nwith the standard generators ei , fi , hi with 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r and relations. Here the generators\nei , fi , hi with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r are those for g. By results of earlier sections, we may assume\nthat all the Serre relations and higher order ones obeyed by ei and fi with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r are\ngiven.\nWe introduce the standard Z-grading of \u011d by decreeing that all h j and ei , fi with\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 r have degree 0, but e0 and f0 have degrees 1 and \u22121 respectively. Then \u011d =\n\u2295k\u2208Z \u011dk , with \u011d0 = g \u2295 gl1 . Now we require that as \u011d0 -modules, all \u011dk are isomorphic\n\n\f36\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nto g. The (necessary and sufficient) conditions meeting this requirement give rise to\nthe defining relations of \u011d.\n\u02c6 r+1 .\nTo illustrate how this may work, we consider the untwisted affine algebra \u011d = sl\nThe relations\n[e1 , [e1 , e0 ]] = 0,\n\n[er , [er , e0 ]] = 0,\n\n[ei , e0 ] = 0, i 6= 1, r\n\narise from the requirement that \u011d1 be an irreducible \u011d0 -module. In [\u011d1 , \u011d1 ], there are \u011d0\nlowest weight vectors [[e1 , e0 ], e0 ] and [[er , e0 ], e0 ], which have weights different from\nany roots of g = slr+1 . Thus the condition that \u011d2 is isomorphic to g as g0 -module\nrequires\n[[e1 , e0 ], e0 ] = 0, [[er , e0 ], e0 ] = 0.\nNow we have derived at all the Serre relations needed for e0 , and those for f0 can be\nsimilarly obtained. Together with relations defining g, these relations define \u011d.\nWe hope to treat the affine superalgebras on another occasion.\nA PPENDIX A.

Let \u03a0b = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r } be the set of simple roots relative to a given\nBorel subalgebra b \u2282 g. Take any isotropic odd simple root \u03b1t \u2208 \u03a0b , and define the\nodd reflection st by\nst (\u03b1t ) = \u2212\u03b1t ,\nst (\u03b1i ) = \u03b1i + \u03b1t ,\n\nif i 6= t and ait 6= 0,\n\nst (\u03b1i ) = \u03b1i ,\n\nif i 6= t and ait = 0.\n\nThen st (\u03a0b ) = {st (\u03b11 ), . . . , st (\u03b1r )} is the set of simple roots relative to another Borel\nsubalgebra, which is not Weyl group conjugate to b. Further odd reflections can be\ndefined with respect to isotropic roots in st (\u03a0b), which turn st (\u03a0b) into sets of simple roots relative to other Borel subalgebras.

An ordering (E1 , E2, . . . , Em+n+2 ) of \u03b5i and \u03b4 j is called admissible if \u03b5i appears\nbefore \u03b5i+1 for all i and \u03b4 j before \u03b4 j+1 for all j. Each admissible ordering corresponds\nto one Weyl group conjugate class of Borel subalgebras, with the associated simple\nroots given by Ea \u2212 Ea+1 (1 \u2264 a \u2264 m + n + 1). In particular, the distinguished Borel\ncorresponds to the admissible ordering such that all the \u03b5i appear before the \u03b4 j . Let us\ndefine [Ea ] (a = 1, 2, . . ., m + n + 2) by [Ea ] = 0 (resp. [Ea] = 1) if Ea is some \u03b5i (resp.\n\u03b4 j ). The a-th node from the left in the Dynkin diagram is associated with the simple\nroot Ea \u2212 Ea+1 , which is white if [Ea ] = [Ea+1 ] and grey otherwise.\nB(m, n), m > 0. Let (E1 , E2 , . . . , Em+n) be an admissible ordering of \u03b5i (i = 1, . . ., m)\nand \u03b4 j ( j = 1, . . ., n).

The a-th node (a <\nm + n) from the left is associated with the simple root Ea \u2212 Ea+1 , which is white if\n[Ea ] = [Ea+1 ] and grey otherwise. The second Dynkin diagram corresponds to the case\nEm+n = \u03b4n . The colours of the nodes marked \u00d7 are assigned in the same way as in\ntype A.\nC(n). We have already specified the colours of the nodes in the Dynkin diagrams, but\nit is still useful to have an explicit description of the simple roots.

To be specific, we denote by \u03b1i the simple roots and take\n(\u03b11 , \u03b13 ) = (\u03b12 , \u03b13 ) = \u22121,\n\n(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 2,\n\n(\u03b13 , \u03b13 ) = 2.\n\nLet p be the parabolic subalgebra generated by all the generators but e1 . Then p = l \u2295 u\nwith l = gl2|1 and u spanned by\n\u03b61 := e1 ,\nX1 := [e1 , e2 ],\n\n\u03b62 := [e1 , e3 ],\nX2 := [[e1 , e2 ], e3 ],\n\nX3 := [[[e1 , e2 ], e3 ], e3 ].\n\n0\n\nGiven the irreducible p-module L\u03bb = Cv0 with lowest weight \u03bb such that\n(\u03bb, \u03b12 ) = 0,\n\n(\u03bb, \u03b13) = 0,\n\n(\u03bb, \u03b11) = \u22122,\n\n\fSERRE PRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS\n\n43\n\n0\n\nwe construct the generalised Verma module V \u03bb = U (g) \u2297U(p) L\u03bb . Then the maximal\nsubmodule M\u03bb of V \u03bb is given by\nM\u03bb = U (g)\u03b61X1 v0 .\n\n(B.1)\n\nThe irreducible quotient L\u03bb = V \u03bb /M\u03bb is 10-dimensional with a basis\nv0 ,\n\u03b61 v0 ,\n\nX1 v0 ,\n\u03b61 X2 v0 ,\n\nX2 v0 ,\n\u03b61 X3 v0 ,\n\nX3 v0 ,\n\u03b61 X1 X3v0 ,\n\nX1 X3 v0 ,\n\u03b61 \u03b62 v0 .\n\nB.2. Graded symmetric tensor for glm|n . Let g = glm|n and set r = m+n\u22121. Choose\nan arbitrary homogeneous basis for the natural module Cm|n with the last element being\nodd. We regard g as consisting of matrices relative to this basis. Take the subalgebra\nconsisting of the upper triangular matrices as the Borel subalgebra, which corresponds\nto an admissible ordering (E1 , E2, . . . , Em+n ) of \u03b5i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) and \u03b4 j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) with\nEm+n = \u03b4n . See Appendix A.2 for more details.\nLet l, u and u be subalgebras respectively spanned by matrix units er+1,r+1 and ei j\nwith 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 r, by ei,r+1 with 1 \u2264 r, and by er+1,i with 1 \u2264 r. Set p = l \u2295 u, which is\na parabolic subalgebra, and g = p \u2295 u.\nFor \u03bb = 2\u03b4n , we consider the generalised Verma module V \u03bb := U (g) \u2297U(p) C\u03bb of\nlowest weight type, where C\u03bb denotes the irreducible p-module with lowest weight \u03bb.\nLet v0 denote a generator of C\u03bb , then\nfr v0 = 0,\nei v0 = 0, fi v0 = 0,\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1,\n(B.2)\ne j j v0 = 2\u03b4 j,r+1 v0 ,\n\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 r + 1,\n\nwhere ei = ei,i+1 and fi = ei+1,i .\nNow V \u03bb \u223c\n= U (u) \u2297 C\u03bb as l-module, where U (u) = Ss (u), the Z2 -graded symmetric\nalgebra of u. This superalgebra has a Z-grading with u having degree 1. It induces a\nnatural Z-grading on V \u03bb . The unique maximal submodule M\u03bb of V \u03bb is the direct sum\nof the homogeneous subspaces of degrees greater than or equal to 3, which is generated\nby U (u)3 \u2297 C\u03bb , the homogeneous subspace of degree 3. The irreducible quotient L\u03bb of\nV \u03bb is isomorphic to the Z2 -graded symmetric tensor of the natural g-module at rank 2.\nThe natural l action on U (u) (obtained by generalising the adjoint action) respects\nthe Z-grading. In the present case, each homogeneous component is in fact an irreducible submodule. We are interested in U (u)3. If u3 is a nonzero lowest weight\nvector of U (u)3, then M\u03bb is generated over g by u3 \u2297 C\u03bb . The form of u3 depends on\nthe ordering of the basis for Cm|n . Denote by Ei j \u2208 U (g) the image of ei j \u2208 g under the\nnatural embedding. The u3 can be expressed as follows:\n3\nu3 = Er,r+1\n,\n2\n(B.3) u3 = Er\u22121,r+1\nEr,r+1 ,\nu3 = Er\u22122,r+1 Er\u22121,r+1 Er,r+1 ,\n\nif Er,r+1 is even;\nif both Er,r+1 and Er\u22121,r are odd;\nif Er,r+1 is odd but Er\u22121,r is even.\n\n\f44\n\nR.B. ZHANG\n\nRemark B.1. The third case becomes vacuous if r = 2; and both the second and third\ncases are vacuous if r = 1.\nThe irreducible quotient L\u03bb = V \u03bb /M\u03bb is isomorphic to the graded skew symmetric\nrank two tensor \u22272s (Cm|n ) of the natural g-module.\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1] S.
