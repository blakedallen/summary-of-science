In particular, we classify\nall transitive Lie bialgebroids. In special cases, they are connected to classical dynamical rmatrices and matched pairs induced by Poisson group actions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLie bialgebroids were introduced by Mackenzie and Xu in [9] as the infinitesimal versions of\nPoisson groupoids. Lie algebroids are, in a certain sense, generalized tangent bundles, while Lie\nbialgebroids can be considered as generalizations of both Poisson structures and Lie bialgebras.\nIt is therefore tempting to classify the local structure of Lie bialgebroids. It is well known that\nat generic points (called regular points) a Lie algebroid A is locally isomorphic to the following\n\"standard\" one:\nA = D \u2295 (M \u00d7 g),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D \u2286 T M is an integrable distribution, which is the image of the anchor, and M \u00d7 g is\na bundle of Lie algebras, namely the isotropy Lie algebras. Here one should think of g as a\nvector space equipped with a family of Lie algebra structures parameterized by points on the\nbase manifold M , denoted by {gx |x \u2208 M }. The Lie brackets are constant along leaves of D. I.e.,\nfor any A, B \u2208 g considered as constant sections1 of A, [A, B] \u2208 C \u221e (M )D \u2297 g, where C \u221e (M )D\nstands for leafwise constant functions on M . The anchor of A is the projection A \u2212\u2192 D. The\nbracket between sections of A is given by\n[X + A, Y + B] = [X, Y ] + (X(B) \u2212 Y (A) + [A, B]),\n\u2217 Research\n\n\u2200X, Y \u2208 \u0393(D), A, B \u2208 C \u221e (M, g). (2)\n\npartially supported by NSF of China and the Research Project of \"Nonlinear Science\".\npartially supported by NSF grant DMS00-72171.\n1 Throughout the paper, we adapt the convention that elements in g (or g\u2217 ) are automatically considered as\nconstant sections on A (or A\u2217 ) unless otherwise specified.\n\u2020 Research\n\n1\n\n\fIn particular, A is a transitive Lie algebroid if D = T M .\nConsider the extended vector bundle\n\u0100 := T M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g) \u2287 D \u2295 (M \u00d7 g) = A.\n\n(3)\n\nThe bracket on \u0393(A) naturally extends to a bracket on sections of \u0100. This is done simply by\napplying the same formula: Equation (2) to X + A, Y + B \u2208 X(M ) \u2295 C \u221e (M, g). Using the\ngraded Leibniz rule, one may extend this bracket to sections of \u2227\u2217 \u0100 as well, which extends the\nordinary Schouten brackets on \u0393(\u2227\u2217 A). However, \u0100 is in general not a Lie algebroid any more.\nFor example, for A, B \u2208 g, X \u2208 X(M ), we have\n[X, [A, B]] + [B, [X, A]] + [A, [B, X]] = LX [A, B],\n\n(4)\n\nwhich may not be zero unless [A, B] is a constant. This extended bundle \u0100 and the brackets on\n\u0393(\u2227\u2217 \u0100) will be useful later in the paper in order to describe the Lie algebroid structure on A\u2217 .\nFor any section \u039b \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 \u0100), by [*, *]\u039b we denote the bracket on \u0393(\u0100\u2217 ) defined by\n[\u03c6, \u03c8]\u039b = L\u039b# \u03c6 \u03c8 \u2212 L\u039b# \u03c8 \u03c6 \u2212 d[\u039b(\u03c6, \u03c8)]\n\n\u2200\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393(\u0100\u2217 ).\n\n(5)\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to classify all possible Lie bialgebroids (A, A\u2217 ) for which A is of the\nstandard form (1). We find that a Lie bialgebroid structure in this case can be totally characterized\nby a pair (\u039b, \u03b4), where \u039b is a section of \u22272 \u0100, and \u03b4 is a bundle map M \u00d7g \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7\u22272 g. Such a pair\ndefines the Lie algebroid structure on A\u2217 . For transitive Lie bialgebroids, one can furthermore\ndescribe such a Lie bialgebroid using a quadruple (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4, \u03b4) satisfying certain equations (see\nTheorem 3.2), where (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4 ) are components of \u039b. In this way, one establishes a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between transitive Lie bialgebroids and equivalence classes of certain quadruples.\nAs applications, we recover a construction, due to Lu [6], of a Lie algebroid arising from a matched\npair induced by a Poisson group action. Another special case is connected to dynamical r-matrices\ncoupled with Poisson manifolds, which is a natural generalization of the classical dynamical rmatrices of Felder [3].\nAcknowledgments.

As mentioned in Introduction, any Lie algebroid A is always locally isomorphic to the\n\"standard\" one (1), so we will assume that A is isomorphic to this form throughout the paper.\nIndeed we say that a Lie bialgebroid (A, A\u2217 ) is regular if A is of the standard form (1). It is\nclear that D\u2217 is isomorphic to the quotient bundle T \u2217 M/D\u22a5 . By pr, we denote the projection\nT \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 D\u2217 . By abuse of notation, we use the same symbol to denote its extension\npr : T \u2217 M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 A\u2217 (\u223c\n= D\u2217 \u2295 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 )).\nFor any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a91 (M ) (or more generally \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393(T \u2217 M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 )), by \u03b1\u0303 we denote its corresponding\nsection in D\u2217 (or A\u2217 ). Hence\ne , \u2200f \u2208 C \u221e (M ).\ndA f = df\n(6)\n\nEven though we are mainly interested in the local structure, our results hold for more general\nsituations as well. Indeed we only need to require that the first leafwise de-Rham cohomology\n1\ngroup HD\n(M ) vanishes.\nThe main theorem of this section is the following:\n2\n\n\fTheorem 2.1. Let (A, A\u2217 ) be a Lie bialgebroid, where A is of the form (1): A = D \u2295 (M \u00d7 g).\n1\nAssume that HD\n(M ) = 0. Then the differential d\u2217 : \u0393(\u2227\u2217 A) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(\u2227\u2217+1 A) corresponding to the\nLie algebroid structure on A\u2217 is of the form:\nd\u2217 = [\u039b, * ] + \u03b4,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u039b \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 \u0100) such that [\u039b, \u0393(A)] \u2282 \u0393(\u22272 A) and \u03b4 is a bundle map M \u00d7g \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7\u22272 g, which\nis constant along leaves of D. Moreover the pair (\u039b, \u03b4) is unique up to a gauge transformation:\n\u039b \u2192 \u039b + r0 , \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b4 \u2212 [r0 , *] for some r0 \u2208 C \u221e (M, g)D .\nHere, as well as in the sequel, \u03b4 is considered as a linear map: \u0393(\u2227\u2217 A) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(\u2227\u2217+1 A), which\nis a graded derivation naturally extending the bundle map \u03b4 : M \u00d7 g \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7 \u22272 g.\nWe will divide the proof into several lemmas. By [*, *]\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217 , we denote, respectively, the\nLie bracket and the anchor of the dual Lie algebroid A\u2217 . Define K \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 \u0100) and \u03b8 \u2208 X(M ) \u2297 g\nby\nK(\u03b1 + \u03be, \u03b2 + \u03b7) =< \u03c1\u2217 \u03be, \u03b2 > \u2212 < \u03c1\u2217 \u03b7, \u03b1 >;\n\u03b8(\u03b1, \u03be) = \u2212 < \u03c1\u2217 \u03be, \u03b1 >,\n\n\u2200\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a91 (M ), \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 g\u2217 .\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nNote that in general K is not a section of \u22272 A. This is because the image of \u03c1\u2217 is not necessarily\ncontained in D. By \u03b8# , we denote the induced bundle map T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7 g:\n< \u03b8# (\u03b1), \u03be >= \u03b8(\u03b1, \u03be).\n\n(10)\n\nIt is obvious to see that\nK # |T \u2217 M = \u03b8# : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 g;\nK # |M\u00d7g\u2217 = \u03c1\u2217 |M\u00d7g\u2217 : M \u00d7 g\u2217 \u2212\u2192 T M.\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nLet \u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ) be the Poisson structure on M induced from the Lie bialgebroid [9].\nProposition 2.2. Under the same hypothesis as in Theorem 2.1, we have\n1. \u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 D);\n2. \u03c0 # = \u03c1\u2217 |D\u2217 \u25e6pr;\n3. \u2200\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a91 (M ), [\u03b1\u0303, \u03b2\u0303]\u2217 = [\u03b1, \u03b2 \u0303]\u03c0 ;\n4. for any f \u2208 C \u221e (M ), d\u2217 f = \u2212\u03c0 # (df ) \u2212 \u03b8# (df );\n5. for any f \u2208 C \u221e (M ), \u03be \u2208 g\u2217 , [dA f, \u03be]\u2217 = \u2212dA (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)f ) + ad\u2217\u03b8# (df ) \u03be;\n6. \u2200\u03be \u2208 g\u2217 , X \u2208 \u0393(D), [\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be), X] \u2208 \u0393(D);\n7. \u2200x \u2208 M , \u03b8# (Dx\u22a5 ) \u2286 Z(gx ), where Z(gx ) is the center of the Lie algebra gx .\n8. \u2200e \u2208 \u0393(A), [K, e] \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A);\n9. K \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A) iff \u03b8# (D\u22a5 ) = 0, or Im(\u03c1\u2217 ) \u2286 D.\nProof. By definition [9], \u03c0 # = \u2212\u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c1\u2217\u2217 , which implies that \u03c0 # (T \u2217 M ) \u2286 D. Thus, it follows that\n\u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 D). On the other hand, we also have \u03c0 # = \u03c1\u2217 \u25e6\u03c1\u2217 , thus \u03c0 # = \u03c1\u2217 |D\u2217 \u25e6pr. This proves (2).\nTherefore\n(13)\n\u03c1\u2217 = \u03c0 # + \u03c1\u2217 |M\u00d7g\u2217 ,\n\n3\n\n\ffrom which (4) follows immediately. (3) follows because \u03c1\u2217 is a Lie algebroid morphism from\nT \u2217 M to A\u2217 [9], where T \u2217 M is equipped with the standard Lie algebroid structure induced from\nthe Poisson tensor \u03c0.\nAs for (5), we have\n\n=\n\n[dA f, \u03be]\u2217\n\u2212Ld\u2217f \u03be\n\n=\n=\n\ndA < \u03b8# (df ), \u03be > +i\u03b8# (df ) dA \u03be\n\u2212dA (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)f ) + ad\u2217\u03b8# (df ) \u03be.\n\nHere we have used the fact that dA \u03be \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 )). Thus (5) is proved.\nGiven any f \u2208 C \u221e (M )D , we have df \u2208 \u0393(D\u22a5 ), and therefore dA f = 0 according to Equation\n(6). By (5), we obtain that dA (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)f ) = 0 and ad\u2217\u03b8# (df ) \u03be = 0.\nIt is obvious that ad\u2217\u03b8# (df ) \u03be = 0 is equivalent to (7). Now dA (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)f ) = 0 is equivalent to\nd(\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)f ) \u2208 \u0393(D\u22a5 ), which implies that X(\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)f ) = 0 for any X \u2208 \u0393(D). The latter is equivalent\nto [X, \u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)](f ) = 0, which implies that [X, \u03c1\u2217 (\u03be)] \u2208 \u0393(D) since f is an arbitrary function in\nC \u221e (M )D . Thus (6) is proved.\nIt is easy to see that (6) implies that [K, X] \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A), \u2200X \u2208 \u0393(D). Next we need to show\nthat [K, A] \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A) for any A \u2208 g considered as a constant section of A. For this purpose,\nlet us choose a local coordinate system (x1 , * * * , xk , xk+1 , * * * , xk+l ) such that D is spanned by\n{ \u2202x\u2202k+j | j = 1, * * * , l}. Then clearly dxi \u2208 \u0393(D\u22a5 ), i = 1, * * * , k. Let Ai (x) = \u2212\u03b8# (dxi ). According\nto (7), we know that Ai (x) \u2208 Z(gx ), for any x and i = 1, * * * , k. Thus, locally we can write\nPl\nPk\n\u2202\nand K2 = j=1 Ak+j \u2227 \u2202x\u2202k+j . It thus follows that\nK = K1 + K2 , where K1 = i=1 Ai \u2227 \u2202x\ni\n[K, A] = [K1 + K2 , A] = [K2 , A] \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A). Then (8) follows immediately.\nFinally, we see, by definition, that K \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A) iff \u03b8# (D\u22a5 ) = 0 or Im(\u03c1\u2217 |M\u00d7g\u2217 ) \u2286 D. The\nlatter is equivalent to Im(\u03c1\u2217 ) \u2286 D due to (1) and Equation (13). This completes the proof of the\nproposition.\n\nCorollary 2.3. We have the following\n1. for any X, Y \u2208 \u0393(D) and A \u2208 g, we have\n[K, [X, Y ]] = [[K, X], Y ] + [X, [K, Y ]];\n[K, [X, A]] = [[K, X], A] + [X, [K, A]].\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\n2. For A, B \u2208 g, if L\u03c1\u2217 (e) [A, B] = 0 for any e \u2208 \u0393(A\u2217 |x ), then\n[K, [A, B]]|x = [[K, A], B]|x + [A, [K, B]]|x .\n\n(16)\n\nProof. Equation (14) is obvious. For Equation (15), we write K = K1 + K2 as in the proof of\nProposition 2.2. From the fact that Ai (x) \u2208 Z(gx ), i = 1, * * * , k, we have\n[K1 , [X, A]] = [[K1 , X], A] + [X, [K1 , A]].\nOn the other hand, from the Jacobi identity of the Schouten bracket on \u0393(\u2227\u2217 A), it follows that\n[K2 , [X, A]] = [[K2 , X], A] + [X, [K2 , A]].\nEquation (15) thus follows.\n4\n\n\fFinally, we note that\n[K2 , [A, B]] = [[K2 , A], B] + [A, [K2 , B]],\nwhile\n([K1 , [A, B]] \u2212 [[K1 , A], B] \u2212 [A, [K1 , B]])|x =\n\nk\nX\n\nAi \u2227 L\n\ni=1\n\nFor any \u03be \u2208 g\u2217 , it is simple to see that \u03be\n#\n\nPk\n( i=1 Ai \u2227 L\n\n(\u03be) + K1# (\u03be) + K2# (\u03be).\n\n#\n\nother hand, \u03c1\u2217 (\u03be) = \u03c0\nSince \u03c0 (\u03be),\nLK # (\u03be) [A, B]. The conclusion (2) thus follows immediately.\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n\n[A, B].\n\n[A, B]) = LK # (\u03be) [A, B]. On the\n\nK2# (\u03be)\n\n1\n\n\u2208 \u0393(D), hence L\u03c1\u2217 (\u03be) [A, B] =\n\n2\n\nThe following result describes the bracket of mixed terms in \u0393(A\u2217 ).\nProposition 2.4. For any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a91 (M ) and \u03be \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ), we have\n[\u03b1\u0303, \u03be]\u2217 = [\u03b1, \u03be] \u0303\u03c0+K .\n\n(17)\n\nProof. First, let f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) be an arbitrary function, and \u03be \u2208 g\u2217 an arbitrary element. Then\n \u0303 , \u03be]\u2217 = [df, \u03be] \u0303 .\naccording to Proposition 2.2 (5), together with Equations (11, 12), we have [df\nK\n \u0303 , \u03be]\u2217 = [df, \u03be] \u0303\nOn the other hand, it is easy to see that [df, \u03be]\u03c0 = 0. Thus, we have [df\n\u03c0+K . Now\nEquation (17) follows immediately from the anchor properties of a Lie algebroid.\n\nThe last step is to analyze the bracket between elements in C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ). Note that \u2200\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208\nC (M, g\u2217 ) and \u2200f \u2208 C \u221e (M ), by Equation (12), one has\n\u221e\n\n[\u03be, f \u03b7]\u2217 \u2212 [\u03be, f \u03b7]K = f ([\u03be, \u03b7]\u2217 \u2212 [\u03be, \u03b7]K ).\nThis implies that [\u03be, \u03b7]\u2217 \u2212 [\u03be, \u03b7]K depends on \u03be, \u03b7 algebraically. On the other hand, [\u03be, \u03b7]\u2217 \u2212 [\u03be, \u03b7]K\ncan be split into two parts:\n[\u03be, \u03b7]\u2217 \u2212 [\u03be, \u03b7]K = \u03a9(\u03be, \u03b7) + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u2022 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03a9(\u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 \u0393(D\u2217 ) and [\u03be, \u03b7]\u2022 \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ). Now [*, *]\u2022 defines a fiberwise bracket on the\nbundle M \u00d7 g\u2217 , while \u03a9(\u03be, \u03b7) corresponds to a g \u2227 g-valued one-form on the bundle D, i.e.,\n\u03a9 \u2208 \u0393(D\u2217 ) \u2297 (\u22272 g). Let \u03a9# : D \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7 (\u22272 g) be its induced bundle map, and \u03b4 \u2022 : M \u00d7 g \u2212\u2192\nM \u00d7 (\u22272 g) the fiberwise cobracket corresponding to [*, *]\u2022 .\nLemma 2.5.\nd\u2217 = [\u03c0 + K, * ] \u2212 \u03a9# + \u03b4 \u2022\n\n(19)\n\nProof. By Propositions 2.2, 2.4 and the fact that [\u03b1, \u03b2]K = [\u03be, \u03b7]\u03c0 = 0, we have\n[\u03b1\u0303 + \u03be, \u03b2\u0303 + \u03b7]\u2217 = [\u03b1 + \u03be, \u03b2 + \u03b7] \u0303\u03c0+K + \u03a9(\u03be, \u03b7) + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u2022 ,\n\n\u2200\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a91 (M ), \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ), (20)\n\nwhich implies Equation (19) immediately.\nProposition 2.6. There exists a function \u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g) and a fiberwise bracket [*, *]\u25e6 on the\nbundle M \u00d7 g\u2217 constant along leaves of D such that\n[\u03be, \u03b7]\u2217 = [\u03be, \u03b7]K+\u03c4 + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u25e6 ,\n5\n\n\u2200\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ).\n\n(21)\n\n\fProof. For any X, Y \u2208 \u0393(D), from the compatibility condition d\u2217 [X, Y ] = [d\u2217 X, Y ] + [X, d\u2217 Y ]\nand Equations (14, 19), it follows that\n\u03a9# [X, Y ] = [\u03a9# X, Y ] + [X, \u03a9# Y ].\nThis is equivalent to that, as a \u22272 g-valued one-form, \u03a9 is dD -closed. By assumption, there exists\na function \u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g) such that \u03a9 = dD \u03c4 . Hence \u03a9# (X) = LX \u03c4, \u2200X \u2208 \u0393(D).\nFor any X \u2208 \u0393(D), A \u2208 g, the compatibility condition d\u2217 [X, A] = [d\u2217 X, A]+[X, d\u2217 A], together\nwith Equations (15, 19), implies that \u2212[\u03a9# (X), A] + [X, \u03b4 \u2022 A] = 0. On the other hand, we have\n[\u03a9# (X), A] \u2212 [X, \u03b4 \u2022 A]\n= [LX \u03c4, A] \u2212 LX \u03b4 \u2022 A\n= LX ([\u03c4, A] \u2212 \u03b4 \u2022 A).\nIt thus follows that [\u03c4, A] \u2212 \u03b4 \u2022 A is constant along leaves of D. Let \u03b4A = \u03b4 \u2022 A \u2212 [\u03c4, A]. Thus, the\nmap\n\u03b4 = \u03b4 \u2022 \u2212 [\u03c4, * ] : g \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g)D\n(22)\nis a cobracket which induces a fiberwise bracket [*, *]\u25e6 on M \u00d7 g\u2217 constant along leaves of D.\nMoreover it is simple to see, from Equation (22), that\n[\u03be, \u03b7]\u2022 = [\u03be, \u03b7]\u25e6 + ad\u2217\u03c4 # \u03be \u03b7 \u2212 ad\u2217\u03c4 # \u03b7 \u03be,\n\n\u2200\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ).\n\nThus, from Equation (18), we get\n[\u03be, \u03b7]\u2217\n\n=\n\n[\u03be, \u03b7]K + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u25e6 + ad\u2217\u03c4 # \u03be \u03b7 \u2212 ad\u2217\u03c4 # \u03b7 \u03be + (dD \u03c4 )(\u03be, \u03b7)\n\n=\n\n[\u03be, \u03b7]K + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u25e6 + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u03c4\n\n=\n\n[\u03be, \u03b7]K+\u03c4 + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u25e6\n\nThis concludes the proof of the proposition.\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1: According to Proposition 2.2 (3), Proposition 2.4, and Proposition\n2.6, we conclude that for any \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393(D\u2217 ), \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ),\n[\u03b1 + \u03be, \u03b2 + \u03b7]\u2217 = [\u03b1 + \u03be, \u03b2 + \u03b7]\u039b + [\u03be, \u03b7]\u25e6 ,\nwhere \u039b = \u03c0 + K + \u03c4 . It thus follows that d\u2217 = [\u039b, * ] + \u03b4, where \u03b4 : M \u00d7 g \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7 \u22272 g is the cobracket dual to [*, *]\u25e6 . Notice that in Proposition 2.6, \u03c4 and \u03b4 are not unique. They can differ by an\nelement r0 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g)D : \u03c41 = \u03c4 +r0 and \u03b41 = \u03b4 \u2212[r0 , *]. However, \u03b4 \u2022 = \u03b4 +[\u03c4, * ] = \u03b41 +[\u03c41 , * ]\nis always fixed. This completes the proof of the theorem.\n\nTheorem 2.7. Under the same hypothesis as in Theorem 2.1, we have\n1. \u039b \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A) iff Im(\u03c1\u2217 ) \u2286 D.\n2. For any x \u2208 M , the cobracket \u03b4x : gx \u2212\u2192 \u22272 gx is a Lie algebra 1-cocycle if L\u03c1\u2217 (e) [A, B] = 0,\n\u2200A, B \u2208 g, e \u2208 \u0393(A\u2217 |x ). In particular, \u03b4x is always a 1-cocycle when Im(\u03c1\u2217 |x ) \u2286 Dx .\n\n6\n\n\fProof. K is the only term in \u039b which is not necessarily a section in \u22272 A. It is thus clear that\n\u039b \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A) iff Im(\u03c1\u2217 ) \u2286 D according to Proposition 2.2 (9).\nFor any A, B \u2208 g, by the compatibility condition d\u2217 [A, B] = [d\u2217 A, B] + [A, d\u2217 B] and Equation\n(19), we have\n\u03b4 \u2022 [A, B] \u2212 ([\u03b4 \u2022 A, B] + [A, \u03b4 \u2022 B]) = \u2212[K, [A, B]] + [[K, A], B] + [A, [K, B]].\nIt thus follows from Corollary 2.3 (2) that \u03b4x\u2022 is a cocycle if L\u03c1\u2217 |x (\u03be) [A, B] = 0 , \u2200\u03be \u2208 g\u2217 . Finally,\nnote that \u03b4x being a cocycle is equivalent to \u03b4x\u2022 being a cocycle since their difference is a coboundary [\u03c4, * ]. Therefore, the theorem is proved.\n\nDefinition 2.8. A regular Lie bialgebroid (A, A\u2217 ), where A is of the standard form: A = D \u2295\n(M \u00d7 g), is called decomposable if Im(\u03c1\u2217 ) \u2286 D.\nWe should note that the role of A and A\u2217 is not symmetric here. In other words, that (A, A\u2217 )\nis decomposable does not necessarily mean that (A\u2217 , A) is decomposable. In fact (A\u2217 , A) may\neven not be regular.\nThe following immediately follows from Proposition 2.2 (9).\nCorollary 2.9. Given a regular Lie bialgebroid (A, A\u2217 ), if gx , \u2200x \u2208 M , are center free (e.g.,\nsemisimple), then (A, A\u2217 ) is decomposable.\nIn particular, if A = M \u00d7 g is a bundle of Lie algebras and gx , \u2200x \u2208 M , are center free,\nA\u2217 = M \u00d7 g\u2217 is also a Lie algebra bundle such that (gx , g\u2217x ), \u2200x \u2208 M , are all Lie bialgebras.\nThe following result is obvious.\nProposition 2.10. If (A, A\u2217 ) is a decomposable Lie bialgebroid as in Definition 2.8 and L is\nany leaf of D, then (A|L , A\u2217 |L ) is a transitive Lie bialgebroid.\nIn other words, one can reduce the study of a decomposable Lie bialgebroid to the study of\ntransitive ones, which is the main topic of the next section.\n\n3\n\nTransitive Lie bialgebroids\n\nThis section is devoted to the study of local structures of transitive Lie bialgebroids, which is a\nspecial case of regular ones. In this case, we have A = T M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g) and the fiberwise brackets\non M \u00d7 g \u2212\u2192 M are constant. We also assume, throughout the section, that H 1 (M ) = {0}.\nTheorem 2.1 implies the following:\nTheorem 3.1. Let A = T M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g) be a transitive Lie algebroid. Assume that H 1 (M ) =\n{0}. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between Lie bialgebroids (A, A\u2217 ) and equivalence\nclasses [(\u039b, \u03b4)], where \u039b \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A), \u03b4 : g \u2212\u2192 g\u2227g is a Lie algebra 1-cocycle satisfying the property\nthat\n1\n[\u03b4\u039b + [\u039b, \u039b], e] + \u03b4 2 e = 0, \u2200e \u2208 \u0393(A),\n(23)\n2\nand the equivalence stands for the gauge equivalence: \u039b \u2192 \u039b+r0 , \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b4\u2212[r0 , *] for some r0 \u2208 \u22272 g.\nProof. Assume that (A, A\u2217 ) is a transitive Lie bialgebroid. According to Theorem 2.1, we know\nthat\nd\u2217 = [\u039b, * ] + \u03b4\n(24)\n\n7\n\n\ffor \u039b \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 A) and \u03b4 : g \u2212\u2192 g \u2227 g. Moreover, by Theorem 2.7, \u03b4 is a Lie algebra 1-cocycle. It is\nsimple to check that\n1\nd2\u2217 = [\u03b4\u039b + [\u039b, \u039b], *] + \u03b4 2 .\n(25)\n2\nThus Equation (23) follows.\nConversely, given a pair (\u039b, \u03b4) satisfying Equation (23), let d\u2217 : \u0393(\u2227\u2217 A) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(\u2227\u2217+1 A) be as\nin Equation (24). Then d\u2217 defines a Lie algebroid on A\u2217 iff d2\u2217 = 0, which is equivalent to: d2\u2217 f = 0\nand d2\u2217 e = 0 for any f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) and e \u2208 \u0393(A). Now we easily see that \u2200f \u2208 C \u221e (M ), e \u2208 \u0393(A),\nd2\u2217 (f e) = f d2\u2217 e + (d2\u2217 f ) \u2227 e.\nIt thus follows that d2\u2217 f = 0 whenever the rank of A is greater than 2. If the rank of A is less than\nor equal to 2, by Equation (25), we have d2\u2217 f = [\u03b4\u039b + 12 [\u039b, \u039b], f ] = 0 since \u03b4\u039b + 12 [\u039b, \u039b] vanishes\nautomatically. Finally, it is clear that the compatibility condition is satisfied automatically.\n\nNow \u039b can be split into three parts: \u039b = \u03c0 + K + \u03c4 , where \u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ), K \u2208 \u0393(g \u2227 T M ) and\n\u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g). Our next task is to spell out the meaning of Equation (23) in terms of these\ndata. Let us explain some notations that will be needed below. Recall the element \u03b8 of X(M ) \u2297 g\ndefined by Equation (9), and the corresponding bundle map \u03b8# : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 M \u00d7 g. Note that \u03b4\n2\nextends\nP naturally to a map, denoted by the same symbol, from X(M ) \u2297 g to X(M ) \u2297 (\u2227 g).

By Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ) \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22273 g), we denote its total antisymmetrization:\n< Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ), \u03be \u2227 \u03b7 \u2227 \u03b6 >=< (\u03b8# d\u03c4 )(\u03be, \u03b7), \u03b6 > +c.p.,\n\n\u2200\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6 \u2208 g\u2217 .\n\n(28)\n\n\u00bfFrom the above discussion, a transitive Lie bialgebroid is then determined by a quadruple\n(\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4, \u03b4). We say two quadruples (\u03c0i , \u03b8i , \u03c4i , \u03b4i ), i = 1, 2, are equivalent if \u03c01 = \u03c02 , \u03b81 = \u03b82 , and\n\u03c41 = \u03c42 + r0 and \u03b41 = \u03b42 \u2212 [r0 , *] for some r0 \u2208 \u22272 g.\nWe are now ready to state the main theorem of this section.\nTheorem 3.2. Under the same hypothesis as in Theorem 3.1, there is a one-one correspondence between transitive Lie bialgebroids (A, A\u2217 ) and equivalence classes of quadruples (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4, \u03b4)\nsatisfying the following properties:\n1. \u03b4 : g \u2212\u2192 g \u2227 g is a Lie algebra 1-cocycle;\n2. \u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ) is a Poisson tensor;\n3. \u03b8# : (T \u2217 M, \u03c0) \u2212\u2192 g is Lie algebroid morphism;\n4. \u03b4\u03b8 + 12 [\u03b8, \u03b8] = [\u03c4, \u03b8] \u2212 \u03c0 # (d\u03c4 );\n5. \u03b4\u03c4 + 12 [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] + Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ) \u2208 \u22273 g is constant on M ;\n6. \u03b4 2 + [\u03b4\u03c4 + 12 [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] + Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ), *] = 0, as a map from g to \u22273 g.\n\n8\n\n\fProof. Each fiber of A is a vector space direct sum Tm M \u2295 g, and therefore admits a natural\nbigrading: elements in Tm M have the degree (1, 0) while elements in the second component g\nhave the degree (0, 1). This also induces a bigrading on the fibers of exterior powers of A and\nconsequently on their sections. It is simple to see that [\u03c0, \u03c0] is of degree (3, 0), [\u03c0, K] is of degree\n(2, 1), [\u03c0, \u03c4 ] is of degree (1, 2), and [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] is of degree (0, 3). On the other hand, [K, \u03c4 ] consists\nof elements of degree (1, 2) and of (0, 3),\nP and [K, K] consists of elements of degree (1, 2) and of\n(2, 1). For any S \u2208 \u0393(\u22273 A), let S = 0\u2264i,j\u22643 S (i,j) be its decomposition with respect to this\nbigrading. The following lemma can be easily verified by a direct computation.\nLemma 3.3. With the above notations,\n1. as a \u22272 g-valued vector field on M , we have [K, K](1,2) = [\u03b8, \u03b8];\n2. As a g-valued bivector field on M , [K, K](2,1) = 2\u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8;\n3. \u03b4K = \u03b4\u03b8; [K, \u03c4 ](1,2) = \u2212[\u03c4, \u03b8];\n4. [K, \u03c4 ](0,3) = Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 );\n5. [\u03c0, K] = d\u03c0 \u03b8.\nWrite\n\n1\nT = \u03b4\u039b + [\u039b, \u039b] \u2208 \u0393(\u22273 A).\n2\nA direct computation, using Lemma 3.3, yields that\nT (3,0)\n\n=\n\nT (2,1)\n\n=\n=\n\nT\n\n(1,2)\n\n=\n=\n\nT (0,3)\n\n=\n=\n\n1\n[\u03c0, \u03c0];\n2\n1\n[\u03c0, K] + [K, K](2,1)\n2\n\u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 + d\u03c0 \u03b8;\n1\n\u03b4K + [K, \u03c4 ](1,2) + [\u03c0, \u03c4 ] + [K, K](1,2)\n2\n1\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u2212 [\u03c4, \u03b8] + [\u03b8, \u03b8] + \u03c0 # (d\u03c4 );\n2\n1\n\u03b4\u03c4 + [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] + [K, \u03c4 ](0,3)\n2\n1\n\u03b4\u03c4 + [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] + Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ).\n2\n\nFor any X \u2208 X(M ), according to Equation (25), we have d2\u2217 X = LX T . Hence d2\u2217 X = 0,\n\u2200X \u2208 X(M ), is equivalent to that T (i,3\u2212i) = 0, i = 1, * * * , 3, and T (0,3) is a constant function.\nThe latter is equivalent to Conditions (2)-(5).\nFor any A \u2208 C \u221e (M, g), it is easy to see that (d2\u2217 A)(3,0) , (d2\u2217 A)(2,1) , and (d2\u2217 A)(1,2) all vanish\nby Conditions (2)-(5). And the only nontrivial term remaining is\n1\n(d2\u2217 A)(0,3) = \u03b4 2 A + [\u03b4\u03c4 + [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] + Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ), A].\n2\nTherefore, we see that d2\u2217 e = 0, \u2200e \u2208 \u0393(A) iff Conditions (2)-(6) hold. The conclusion thus\nfollows by Theorem 3.1.\n\n9\n\n\f4\n\nApplications\n\nAs applications, in this section, we will consider two special cases of transitive Lie bialgebroids.\nThey are connected, respectively, to the Lie algebroids arising from Poisson group actions [6],\nand dynamical r-matrices [3].\nLet (A, A\u2217 ) be a transitive Lie bialgebroid corresponding to a quadruple (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4, \u03b4) as in\nTheorem 3.2. From Proposition 2.6, it is simple to see that the subbundle M \u00d7 g\u2217 of A\u2217 =\nT \u2217 M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) is a Lie subalgebroid iff d\u03c4 = 0, or \u03c4 \u2208 \u22272 g is a constant.\n\u00bfFrom now on, we will assume that M \u00d7g\u2217 is a Lie subalgebroid. Thus one may simply assume\nthat \u03c4 = 0 via a gauge transformation. By Theorem 3.2 (6), we have \u03b4 2 = 0. This implies that\ng\u2217 is a Lie algebra such that (g, g\u2217 ) is indeed a Lie bialgebra. Theorem 3.2 (4) is equivalent to\nthat the linear map \u2212(\u03b8# )\u2217 : g\u2217 \u2212\u2192 X(M ) obtained by taking the opposite of the dual of \u03b8# is a\nLie algebra morphism. Hence, it defines a right action of g\u2217 on M . Theorem 3.2 (3) is equivalent\nto saying that this is a Poisson action (Proposition 5.4 in [10]). In conclusion, when \u03c4 = 0, the\nconditions in Theorem 3.2 reduce to the statement that (g, g\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebra and M is a\nPoisson g\u2217 -manifold. In this case, the Lie algebroid structure on A\u2217 = T \u2217 M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) can be\ndescribed more explicitly. First, we note that the subbundle T \u2217 M is also a Lie subalgebroid of A\u2217 .\nIn other words, both summands of A\u2217 are Lie subalgebroids. Therefore, in order to describe the\nbracket on \u0393(A\u2217 ), it suffices to consider the bracket between the mixed terms. For this purpose,\nconsider the maps:\n\u03c6 : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 CDO(M \u00d7 g\u2217 ),\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c8 : M \u00d7 g \u2212\u2192 CDO(T M ),\n\n\u03c6(\u03b1)(\u03be) = L\u03c0# \u03b1 \u03be + ad\u2217\u03b8# \u03b1 \u03be\n\nand\n\n#\n\n\u03c8(\u03be)(\u03b1) = \u2212 < \u03be, d(\u03b8 \u03b1) > \u2212i(\u03b8#)\u2217 \u03be d\u03b1,\n\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a91 (M ) and \u03be \u2208 C \u221e (M, g\u2217 ). Here CDO stands for covariant differential operators [7], and\n< *, * > means the pairing between g\u2217 and g. Now a simple computation, using Proposition 2.4,\nyields that\n[\u03b1, \u03be]\u2217\n=\n=\n\n[\u03b1, \u03be]\u03c0+K\nL\u03c0# \u03b1 \u03be + LK # \u03b1 \u03be \u2212 LK # \u03be \u03b1 \u2212 d < K # \u03b1, \u03be >\n\n=\n\nL\u03c0# \u03b1 \u03be + ad\u2217\u03b8# (\u03b1) \u03be\u2212 < \u03b8# (\u03b1), d\u03be > +i(\u03b8# )\u2217 \u03be d\u03b1 + d < \u03be, \u03b8# (\u03b1) >\n\n=\n\n\u03c6(\u03b1)(\u03be) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03be)(\u03b1).\n\nAs a consequence, we conclude that (1). both \u03c6 and \u03c8 are Lie algebroid representations, (2).\n(T \u2217 M, M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) is a matched pair, and (3). A\u2217 is isomorphic to the corresponding Lie algebroid\nT \u2217 M \u22b2\u22b3 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) [8]. This Lie algebroid was studied in detail by Lu in [6].\nNow we can summarize the discussion above in the following:\nTheorem 4.1. A quadruple (\u03c0, \u03b8, 0, \u03b4) as in Theorem 3.2 satisfies the conditions in Theorem\n3.2 iff \u03c0 is a Poisson tensor, \u03b4 defines a Lie bialgebra and \u03b8 induces a right g\u2217 -Poisson action.\nIn this case, the dual Lie algebroid A\u2217 is isomorphic to the matched pair T \u2217 M \u22b2\u22b3 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) as\nmentioned above.\nIn other words, under the bijection of Theorem 3.2, the classes of quadruples (\u03c0, \u03b8, 0, \u03b4) correspond to those transitive Lie bialgebroids (A, A\u2217 ) where A\u2217 is the double of the matched pairs\n(T \u2217 M, M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) of a Poisson group action.\nRemark 4.2. More generally, instead of \u03c4 = 0, one may consider the situation where Conditions\n\n10\n\n\f(4)-(6) of Theorem 3.2 are replaced by\n1\n\u03b4\u03b8 + [\u03b8, \u03b8] = 0;\n2\n[\u03c4, \u03b8] \u2212 \u03c0 # (d\u03c4 ) = 0;\n\u03b4 2 = 0; and\n1\n\u03b4\u03c4 + [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] + Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ) = 0.\n2\n\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\n\nEquations (29, 31) imply that \u03b4 defines a Lie bialgebra and \u03b8 induces a right g\u2217 -Poisson action,\nand therefore one can form a Lie algebroid T \u2217 M \u22b2\u22b3 (M \u00d7 g\u2217 ) as in Theorem 4.1. It is simple\nto see that Equations (30, 32) mean that \u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g), considered as a section of \u22272 A, is\na Hamiltonian operator, i.e., its graph \u0393\u03c4 is a Dirac structure of A \u2295 A\u2217 [4]. In this case A\u2217 is\nisomorphic to the corresponding Lie algebroid \u0393\u03c4 . This is a generalization of the situation studied\nin [5]. Note that Equation (30) is equivalent to that\nXf \u03c4 = ad\u03b8# (df ) \u03c4,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 C \u221e (M ),\n\n(33)\n\nwhich implies that \u03c4 is completely determined, on a symplectic leaf, by its value at a particular\npoint of the leaf. It would be interesting to investigate what kind of equation \u03c4 satisfies when\nbeing viewed as a function on the leaf space (compare with Theorem 3.14 in [2]).\nAnother special case of Theorem 3.2 is when the quadruple (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4, \u03b4) is equivalent to (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4, 0).\nIn this case, the corresponding Lie bialgebroid must be a coboundary Lie bialgebroid with\n\u039b = \u03c0 + K + \u03c4.\nTheorem 4.3. There is a one-one correspondence between coboundary Lie bialgebroids (A, A\u2217 ),\nwhere A = T M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g), and triples (\u03c0, \u03b8, \u03c4 ) satisfying the properties:\n1. \u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ) is a Poisson tensor;\n2. \u03b8# : (T \u2217 M, \u03c0) \u2212\u2192 g is Lie algebroid morphism;\n3.\n\n1\n2 [\u03b8, \u03b8]\n\n= [\u03c4, \u03b8] \u2212 \u03c0 # (d\u03c4 );\n\n4. Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ) + 12 [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] \u2208 (\u22273 g)g (i.e., it is constant on M as well as ad-invariant).\nDefinition 4.4. For a Poisson manifold (M, \u03c0) and a Lie algebra g, assume that there exists a\ntensor \u03b8 \u2208 X(M ) \u2297 g such that \u03b8# : (T \u2217 M, \u03c0) \u2212\u2192 g is a Lie algebroid morphism. A function\n\u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g) is called a dynamical r-matrix coupled with the Poisson manifold (M, \u03c0) via \u03b8 if\nboth conditions (3) and (4) in Theorem 4.3 are satisfied. Here \u03b8 is called a coupling tensor, and\nthe equation\n1\nAlt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ) + [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] = \u03a9 \u2208 (\u22273 g)g ,\n(34)\n2\nis called the generalized DYBE coupled with (\u03c0, \u03b8).\nWith this definition, Theorem 4.3 can be rephrased as follows.\nTheorem 4.5. A function \u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (M, \u22272 g) is a dynamical r-matrix coupled with a Poisson\ntensor \u03c0 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ) via \u03b8 iff \u039b := \u03c0 + K + \u03c4 defines a coboundary Lie bialgebroid structure for\nthe Lie algebroid T M \u2295 (M \u00d7 g).\nNow we consider an example, which is in fact the main motivation for the above definition.\n\n11\n\n\fExample 4.6. Assume that M = h\u2217 where h \u2286 g is a Lie subalgebra. Then M is a Poisson\nmanifold with the Lie-Poisson structure \u03c0. In this case, T \u2217 M \u223c\n= h\u2217 \u00d7 h. Let \u03b8# : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 g be\n\u2217\n#\nthe projection: (\u03be, v) \u2212\u2192 v, \u2200(\u03be, v) \u2208 h \u00d7 h. Clearly \u03b8 is a Lie algebroid morphism. Let us fix\na basis of h, say {e1 , e2P\n, * * * , ek }, and let (\u03bb1 , * * * , \u03bbk ) be its corresponding coordinate system on\n\u2202\n\u2202\nh\u2217 . Then we have \u03b8 = i \u2202\u03bb\n\u2297 ei , where \u2202\u03bb\n, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, are considered as constant vector fields\ni\ni\n\u2217\n\u221e \u2217\non h . Clearly [\u03b8, \u03b8] = 0. Thus, for any \u03c4 \u2208 C (h , \u22272 g), Condition (3) in Theorem 4.3 takes the\nform [\u03c4, \u03b8] = \u03c0 # (d\u03c4 ), which, according to Equation (33), is equivalent to that\nad\u03be \u03c4 = Xl\u03be (\u03c4 ),\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 h.\n\n(35)\n\nHere Xl\u03be denotes the Hamiltonian vector field of the linear function l\u03be on h\u2217 . Thus, If H denotes a\nconnected Lie group with Lie algebra h, Equation (35) is equivalent to that the map \u03c4 : h\u2217 \u2212\u2192 \u22272 g\nis H-equivariant. Condition (4) in Theorem 4.3 becomes\n1\nAlt(d\u03c4 ) + [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] \u2208 (\u22273 g)g .\n2\nIn other words, \u03c4 is a classical dynamical r-matrix in the sense of Felder [3, 2]. We thus recover\nthe main result in [1].\nWe end the paper with the following\nExample 4.7. Let (M, \u03c0) be any Poisson manifold and g = sl(2, R) with the standard generators\n{H, E+ , E\u2212 }:\n[H, E+ ] = E+ , [H, E\u2212 ] = \u2212E\u2212 , [E+ , E\u2212 ] = 2H.\nTake \u03b8 = Xf \u2297 H, where f is a smooth function on M and Xf its Hamiltonian vector field.\nClearly \u03b8# : (T \u2217 M, \u03c0) \u2212\u2192 g is Lie algebroid morphism because d\u03c0 \u03b8 + \u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 = 0.\nLet\n\u03c4 = ef H \u2227 E+ + e\u2212f H \u2227 E\u2212 + E+ \u2227 E\u2212 ,\nwhich can be considered as a twist of standard r-matrix on sl(2, R). Obviously [\u03b8, \u03b8] = 0 and\n[\u03c4, \u03b8] = \u03c0 # (dr) = Xf \u2297 (ef H \u2227 E+ \u2212 e\u2212f H \u2227 E\u2212 )\nso that the condition in Theorem 4.3 (3) holds. For Theorem 4.3 (4), note that Alt(\u03b8# d\u03c4 ) = 0\nand [\u03c4, \u03c4 ] = 3H \u2227 E+ \u2227 E\u2212 \u2208 (\u22273 g)g . Hence \u03c4 is indeed a dynamical r-matrix coupled with \u03c0 via\n\u03b8.\nIn particular, let M = R2 be equipped with the standard symplectic structure \u03c9 = dx \u2227 dy\nand f = ax \u2212 by. Then we have\n\u03c0\n\u03b8\n\u03c4 (x, y)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2227\n\u2202x \u2202y\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ a ) \u2297 H,\n= (b\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n=\n\nand\n\n= eax\u2212by H \u2227 E+ + e\u2212(ax\u2212by) H \u2227 E\u2212 + E+ \u2227 E\u2212 .\n\nReferences\n[1] Bangoura, M. and Kosmann-Schwarzbach, Y., Equation de Yang-Baxter dynamique classique\net algebroides de Lie, C.
