The 3\u03c3 values derived in [1] from all existing experimental neutrino oscillation\ndata are\n7.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 < \u2206m2\u2299 < 9.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 < \u2206m2atm < 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\n0.23 < sin2 \u03b8\u2299 < 0.38,\n0.34 < sin2 \u03b8atm < 0.68,\n|Ue3 |2 < 0.047,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere \u2206m2\u2299 \u2261 m22 \u2212 m21 is the solar mass-squared difference, \u2206m2atm \u2261 |m23 \u2212 m21 | is the\natmospheric mass-squared difference, \u03b8\u2299 is the solar mixing angle, \u03b8atm is the atmospheric\nmixing angle, and Ue3 is one of the elements of the lepton mixing matrix U. As seen\nin (3)\u2013(5), salient features of U are:\n\u2022 The solar mixing angle is large but not maximal, its sine-squared being possibly\nequal to 1/3.\n\u2022 The atmospheric mixing angle is large and maybe maximal, its sine-squared being\npossibly equal to 1/2.\n\u2022 Ue3 is small, it possibly vanishes.\nThe Harrison\u2013Perkins\u2013Scott (HPS) Ansatz [2, 3] for the lepton mixing matrix incorporates\nthe three likely values given above: sin2 \u03b8\u2299 = 1/3, sin2 \u03b8atm = 1/2, and Ue3 = 0. It states\nthat U = XV X \u2032 , where X and X \u2032 are diagonal unitary matrices and\nV = (V1 , V2 , V3 ) ,\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u221a\nV1 =\n\uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8 ,\n6 \u22121\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n1 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u221a\nV2 =\n\uf8ed 1 \uf8f8,\n3 1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u221a\nV3 =\n\uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8 .\n2\n1\n\n(6)\n\nSince V is an orthogonal matrix, the relations\nVjT Vk = \u03b4jk\n\nfor j, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\n\n(7)\n\nhold.\nIt is relatively easy to devise models which simultaneously produce a maximal \u03b8atm\nand a vanishing Ue3 -see for instance [4, 5]. It is much more difficult to reproduce the\nthird feature of the HPS mixing matrix, namely sin2 \u03b8\u2299 = 1/3. Some schemes or models\nhave recently appeared which realize HPS mixing [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; for a review see [11].\nWith the exception of [8] which uses SU(3), those models rely on an internal symmetry\nA4 . They use the following method, first put forward in [2]. Defining\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22121 + i 3\n2\u03c0\n=\n,\n(8)\n\u03c9 \u2261 exp i\n3\n2\n2\n\n\fthey try to get at\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nU = Ul U\u03bd = diag 1, \u03c9, \u03c9 2 \u00d7 V \u00d7 diag (1, 1, \u2212i) ,\nwhere\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 1 1\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nUl = \u221a \uf8ed 1 \u03c9 \u03c9 2 \uf8f8\n3 1 \u03c92 \u03c9\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nis the unitary matrix diagonalizing the charged-lepton mass matrix, and\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 \u221a0 \u22121\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u221a\nU\u03bd =\n2 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0\n2 1 0\n1\n\n(11)\n\nis the unitary matrix diagonalizing the neutrino mass matrix.\nWe, on the contrary, shall produce in this paper a model wherein, in a convenient\nweak basis, the charged-lepton mass matrix is already diagonal from the start, while the\nneutrino mass matrix in that weak basis, M\u03bd , is diagonalized by the HPS matrix:\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nV T M\u03bd V = diag m1 ei\u03c61 , m2 ei\u03c62 , m3 ei\u03c63 .\n\n(12)\n\nInstead of A4 as internal symmetry, our model is based on an extension of S3 .\nThe basic idea behind our model is the following. Suppose that one has a seesaw\nmechanism [12, 13], with a neutrino Majorana mass matrix of the form\nMD+M =\n\n0 MDT\nMD MR\n\n!\n\n(13)\n\nproducing an effective light-neutrino mass matrix\nM\u03bd = \u2212MDT MR\u22121 MD .\n\n(14)\n\nSuppose that the neutrino Dirac mass matrix MD and the right-handed-neutrino Majorana mass matrix MR are of the form\nMD = a1,\n\nMR = \u03bc0 1 + \u03bc1 A + \u03bc2 B,\n\n(15)\n\nwith complex parameters a and \u03bc0,1,2 , and\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 1 1\n\uf8ec\nA=\uf8ed 1 0 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\n1 1 0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0\n0\n\uf8ec\nB = \uf8ed 0 1 \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n0 \u22121 1\n\n(16)\n\n(In (15) and throughout this paper, the unit matrix 1 is always 3 \u00d7 3.) Equation (15)\nshould be understood as holding in the weak basis where the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal, as already stated before. Now, V diagonalizes MR , because V1,2,3 are\nsimultaneous eigenvectors of A and B:\nMR V1\nMR V2\nMR V3\nT\nV MR V\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1 ) V1 ,\n(\u03bc0 + 2\u03bc1 ) V2 ,\n(\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1 + 2\u03bc2 ) V3 ,\ndiag (\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1 , \u03bc0 + 2\u03bc1 , \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1 + 2\u03bc2 ) .\n3\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n\n\fSince MD \u221d 1 commutes with V , one obtains that in this case U is equal to V times a\ndiagonal unitary matrix, the light-neutrino masses being\nm1 =\n\na2\n,\n\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1\n\nm2 =\n\na2\n,\n\u03bc0 + 2\u03bc1\n\nm3 =\n\na2\n.\n\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1 + 2\u03bc2\n\n(21)\n\nOne thus reproduces HPS mixing.\nIn section 2 of this paper we present our model: its field content, internal symmetries,\nand Lagrangian. In section 3 we assume a definite form for the VEVs of some scalar fields\nof our model and therefrom derive that the lepton mixing matrix is of the HPS form. In\nsection 4 we show that the scalar potential of the model is capable of producing VEVs of\nthe desired form. We present our conclusions in section 5.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nNext we incorporate the idea at the end of the previous section into a model. It turns\nout that the model has to be supersymmetric;1 the argument for this will be given in\nsection 4. However, for convenience and transparency, we shall use, wherever possible, a\nnon-supersymmetric notation.\nFermions: For \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , three left-handed lepton doublets DL\u03b1 , three right-handed\ncharged leptons \u03b1R , and four right-handed neutrinos \u03bdR\u03b1 and NR .\nScalars: For \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , three Higgs doublets \u03c6\u03b1 with hypercharge +1; furthermore,\none Higgs doublet \u03c6\u03bd with hypercharge \u22121;2 also, four complex singlets of SU(2) with\nzero hypercharge: \u03c7\u03b1 and S.\nDiscrete symmetries:\n\u2022 One permutation group S3 , effecting simultaneous permutations of the DL\u03b1 , \u03b1R ,\n\u03bdR\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b1 , and \u03c7\u03b1 .\n\u2022 Three Z2 symmetries\nz\u03b1 :\n\nDL\u03b1 \u2192 \u2212DL\u03b1 , \u03b1R \u2192 \u2212\u03b1R , \u03bdR\u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u03bdR\u03b1 , \u03c7\u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u03c7\u03b1 .\n\n(22)\n\nNotice that \u03c6\u03b1 does not change sign under z\u03b1 .

Hence we must add to our model two more Higgs doublets with hypercharge\n\u22121. This addition is inconsequential, though, provided all Higgs doublets with hypercharge \u22121 behave\nunder the internal symmetries in the way \u03c6\u03bd does.\n\n4\n\n\f\u2022 Three Z2 symmetries\n\nzh\u03b1 :\n\n\u03b1R \u2192 \u2212\u03b1R , \u03c6\u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6\u03b1 .\n\n(23)\n\nNR \u2192 \u2212NR , \u03c7e \u2192 \u2212\u03c7e , \u03c7\u03bc \u2192 \u2212\u03c7\u03bc , \u03c7\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u03c7\u03c4 .\n\n(24)\n\nThe zh\u03b1 are meant to ensure that the \u03c6\u03b2 with \u03b2 6= \u03b1 have no Yukawa couplings to\n\u03b1R .\n\u2022 One Z2 symmetry\nz\u03c7 :\n\nNotice that the scalar singlet S is invariant under all these symmetries.

This S2 is broken only spontaneously.\n\u2022 The z\u03b1 are broken softly by terms both of dimension 3 and of dimension 2. In\nparticular, they are broken by the bare Majorana masses of the \u03bdR\u03b1 , see (26) below.\nThis soft breaking by the Majorana masses corresponds to the soft breaking of the\nfamily lepton numbers in the models of [4, 15].\n\u2022 The zh\u03b1 are broken softly by terms both of dimension 3 and of dimension 2.

With (32) we may write\nM = (0, m, \u2212m) ,\n\nwhere m = y\u03c7 w.\n\n(33)\n\nWhat is the idea behind this construction? First suppose that in the MR of (31) the\nentry m\u0304N is much larger than all other entries. Then, there is a seesaw mechanism within\nthe 4 \u00d7 4 matrix MR itself, generating an effective 3 \u00d7 3 matrix \u03bc\u03040 1 + \u03bc1 A \u2212 M T M /m\u0304N ,\nwhich is exactly of the form proposed in (15) provided M is of the form in (33). Next let\nus admit that m\u0304N is not much larger than the other entries of MR ; we shall demonstrate\nin the rest of the present section that HPS mixing is realized even in that general case.\nWe define the vectors\nVj\n0\n\nWj =\n\n!\n\nfor j = 1, 2, 3,\n\nW4 =\n\n03\u00d71\n1\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nand the real orthogonal matrix W = (W1 , W2 , W3 , W4 ).

We have obtained an (indirect) realization of the idea in\nsection 1.\n7\n\n\f4\n\nThe scalar sector and the VEVs\n\nRecall the features of the VEVs that our model requires:\n\u2022 The VEVs v\u03b1 of the \u03c6\u03b1 must be all different in order that the charged-lepton masses\nare all different.\n\u2022 The VEVs w\u03b1 of the \u03c7\u03b1 must obey (32) in order to obtain the matrix B of (16) in\nMR .\nNow suppose that our model was not supersymmetric. Then, in the scalar potential,\nterms like\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c6\u2020e \u03c6e |\u03c7e |2 + \u03c6\u2020\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc |\u03c7\u03bc |2 + \u03c6\u2020\u03c4 \u03c6\u03c4 |\u03c7\u03c4 |2 ,\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c6\u2020\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc + \u03c6\u2020\u03c4 \u03c6\u03c4 |\u03c7e |2 + \u03c6\u2020e \u03c6e + \u03c6\u2020\u03c4 \u03c6\u03c4 |\u03c7\u03bc |2 + \u03c6\u2020e \u03c6e + \u03c6\u2020\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc |\u03c7\u03c4 |2\n\n(40)\n\nwould be unavoidable. Once all the v\u03b1 are different, terms like the ones in (40) force\nthe w\u03b1 to be all different too (unless they all vanish, which is not what we want). This\nmeans that terms of dimension 4 in the scalar potential which contain simultaneously the\nHiggs doublets and the \u03c7 singlets must be forbidden. The only way to do this seems to\nbe supersymmetry (SUSY). In SUSY the scalar potential has three contributions:\n\u2022 the D terms from the gauge interactions,\n\u2022 the F terms from the superpotential W , and\n\u2022 soft SUSY-breaking terms, which are of dimension less than 4.\nThe \u03c7 fields have no D terms since they are gauge singlets with hypercharge zero. In\nthe superpotential W , the symmetries of our model do not allow terms with products of\n\u03c7 fields and Higgs doublets. Therefore, once our model has been supersymmetrized, its\nscalar potential has no unwanted dimension-4 terms.\nThe symmetry z\u03c7 in our model is necessary in order to forbid terms like\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c6\u2020e \u03c6e \u03c7e + \u03c6\u2020\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc \u03c7\u03bc + \u03c6\u2020\u03c4 \u03c6\u03c4 \u03c7\u03c4 ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhich would also be dangerous. Unfortunately, z\u03c7 also forbids cubic \u03c7\u03b1 terms in the\nsuperpotential W ; this absence has as a consequence the absence of quartic \u03c7\u03b1 terms in\nscalar potential. Hence, we have to introduce the scalar field S in order to allow for the\nfirst term in (28), which gives then rise to a quartic \u03c7\u03b1 term in the scalar potential.\nThe scalar potential of our supersymmetric model is a sum V = VS + V\u03c6S + V\u03c7S , where\nVS is a functions of S alone, V\u03c6S contains the pure Higgs doublet terms and the mixed\nS\u2013Higgs doublet terms, and analogously for V\u03c7S . The full separation of V\u03c6S from V\u03c7S\nallows us to achieve completely different forms for the VEVs of the \u03c6 doublets and \u03c7\nsinglets. This is a crucial feature of our model.\n\n8\n\n\f4.1\n\nThe VEVs of the \u03c7\u03b1\n\nThe terms in the superpotential containing the fields \u03c7\u0302\u03b1 ,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03bc\u2032 + \u03bb\u015c (\u03c7\u0302e \u03c7\u0302e + \u03c7\u0302\u03bc \u03c7\u0302\u03bc + \u03c7\u0302\u03c4 \u03c7\u0302\u03c4 ) + 2\u03bc\u2032\u2032 (\u03c7\u0302e \u03c7\u0302\u03bc + \u03c7\u0302e \u03c7\u0302\u03c4 + \u03c7\u0302\u03bc \u03c7\u0302\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(42)\n\nlead in V\u03c7S to the following quadratic terms:\n|\u03c7e |2 + |\u03c7\u03bc |2 + |\u03c7\u03c4 |2 ,\n\u0010\n\n(43)\n\n\u0011\n\nRe \u03c7\u2217e \u03c7\u03bc + \u03c7\u2217e \u03c7\u03c4 + \u03c7\u2217\u03bc \u03c7\u03c4 .\n\nThese may be added to the soft-breaking terms, which are more general anyway. But (42)\nalso leads to a quartic term\n\u03bb2 (\u03c7e )2 + (\u03c7\u03bc )2 + (\u03c7\u03c4 )2\n\n2\n\n(44)\n\nwhich is crucial, since without this term the potential for the \u03c7 fields would be purely\nquadratic and all those fields would then be forced to have vanishing VEVs. This is the\ncrucial role played by \u015c in our model.\nLet us now consider how V\u03c7S depends on the \u03c7 fields.3 The symmetry z\u03c7 , which is\nbroken only spontaneously, forces V\u03c7S to contain only quadratic and quartic terms on the\n\u03c7 fields.

Our model is a supersymmetric extension of an extended Standard\nModel, based on the internal symmetry group S3 and on seven Z2 symmetries, out of which\nsix do not commute with S3 ;4 three of these Z2 symmetries have a natural interpretation\nas discrete family lepton numbers. The group S3 simply permutes the families \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4\n4\n\nIn other words, the actual symmetry group is generated by the S3 and six\nthus much larger than S3 .\n\n11\n\nZ2\n\nsymmetries, and is\n\n\fand easily allows to describe the particle content of our model. We have the left-handed\nlepton doublets (DL\u03b1 ) and the right-handed charged-lepton singlets (\u03b1R ), just as in the\nStandard Model; furthermore, there are four right-handed neutrino singlets (\u03bdR\u03b1 , NR ),\nfour Higgs doublets (\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03bd ), and four scalar singlets with hypercharge zero (\u03c7\u03b1 , S); the\nfields NR , \u03c6\u03bd , and S are not affected by S3 . Superpartners have to be supplied to all the\nfields above.\nThe following mechanisms are of importance for our model:\n\u2022 For the generation of each of the three charged-lepton masses m\u03b1 we need a separate\nHiggs doublet; the different values of the three m\u03b1 are produced by the different\nVEVs v\u03b1 of the Higgs doublets. In this way, the charged-lepton mass matrix is\nautomatically diagonal.\n\u2022 The seesaw mechanism is responsible for the smallness of the neutrino masses.\n\u2022 Lepton mixing originates in the mass matrix MR of the right-handed neutrino singlets. In order to obtain the desired structure of MR , we need the S3 invariance,\nsoft breaking of the discrete lepton numbers in the \u03bdR Majorana mass terms, and\nthe special relation (32) among the VEVs w\u03b1 of the scalar singlets \u03c7\u03b1 .\n\u2022 SUSY and the Z2 symmetry z\u03c7 of (24) forbid terms in the scalar potential which\nwould destroy the relation (32); SUSY is crucial for an adequate separation of the\nHiggs-doublet terms from the scalar-singlet terms in the scalar potential, such that\nwe achieve three different VEVs v\u03b1 while the w\u03b1 fulfill the relation (32).\n\u2022 A further mechanism to obtain the desired VEVs is the soft breaking of S3 down to\nS2 , the \u03bc\u2013\u03c4 interchange symmetry, by terms of dimension 2.\nWe have taken care to demonstrate that the VEV configuration required to obtain HPS\nmixing corresponds to a local minimum of the scalar potential.\nIn our model the neutrino masses and the Majorana phases are free, in contrast to\nlepton mixing which is completely fixed by construction. In this sense, the present model\nrealizes a decoupling of the mixing problem from the mass problem; the latter is beyond\nthe scope of the present model.\nSince the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal, flavour-changing neutral Yukawa\ninteractions are absent at tree level in the charged-lepton sector. However, such interactions appear at the one-loop level [17]. The specific nature of the lepton-flavour violation\nmakes \u03bc\u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03b3 unmeasurably small, but \u03bc\u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 e+ e\u2212 is possibly in the range of future\nexperiments [17].\nThe symmetries invoked to enforce the HPS mixing scheme hold at the seesaw scale.\nThus, the renormalization group evolution down to the weak scale will introduce corrections to the HPS mixing angles. However, it is well known that such corrections can only\nbe sizeable for a quasi-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum [18, 19]. This was confirmed\nin [20] by the consideration of general perturbations of a \u03bc\u2013\u03c4 symmetric neutrino mass\nmatrix. In any case, a first test of the HPS scheme will be performed with the nearfuture experiments planned for measuring |Ue3 |-for a review and assessment of these\nexperiments see [21].\n12\n\n\fThe model presented here uses an intricate interplay of symmetries and mechanisms; a\ngood part of this expenditure is used for stabilizing the desired VEVs. Our model is not,\nthough, unduly complicated when compared to other models which produce HPS mixing.\nThis lets us wonder whether HPS mixing is actually realized in Nature through symmetries\nor it simply comes about by accident. Anyway, the present model is the simplest one that\nwe could construct which realizes the basic idea delineated in equations (13)\u2013(21) of\nsection 1.\n\nAcknowledgements: We thank Alfred Bartl, Thomas Kernreiter, and Jorge Crispim\nRom\u00e3o for useful discussions on soft breaking and SUSY.
