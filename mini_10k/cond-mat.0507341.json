Two types of doping are examined,\nand namely, the substitution of rare-earth ions by non-magnetic ions that introduce (i) one or (ii) none additional electron (per non-magnetic ion) into the\nconduction band. It is found that the first type of substitution increases the\naverage f -state occupancy of rare-earth ions, whereas the second type of substitution has the opposite effect. The results obtained are used to describe valence\ntransition behavior of samarium in the hexaboride solid solutions Sm1\u2212x Mx B6\n(M = Y 3+ , La3+ , Sr 2+ , Y b2+ ) and a very good agreement of theoretical and\nexperimental results is found.\n\nPACS nrs.:75.10.Lp, 71.27.+a, 71.28.+d, 71.30.+h\n\n1\n\n\fIn the past decade, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to understanding of the multitude of anomalous physical properties of rare-earth and\ntransition-metal compounds. Recent theoretical works based on exact numerical\nand analytical calculations showed that many of these anomalous features, e.g.,\nmixed valence phenomena, metal-insulator transitions, etc., can be described very\nwell within different versions of the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) [1, 2, 3]. In\nparticular, it has been found that the spinless FKM, can describe the discontinuous\nvalence and insulator-metal transitions [4, 5] (induced by external pressure) observed\nexperimentally in some rare-earth sulfides, halides and borides [6]. A nice correspondence between theoretical and experimental results has been found, for example, for\nSmB6 [5, 7, 8, 9], where the alternative explanation of formation and disappearance\nof the energy gap in the electronic spectrum of SmB6 has been presented. For SmB6\na very good agreement of experimental and theoretical results has been obtained also\nfor nonzero temperatures for both the temperature dependence of the specific heat\nas well as magnetic susceptibility [10]. In addition, it was found that the spinless\nFKM can describe the anomalous temperature increase of electrical conductivity \u03c3\nin SmB6 (due to the valence transition) [11] as well as the low temperature behavior\nof \u03c3 (due to the appearance of the in-gap structure) in this material [9, 12]. Recently, the FKM has been successfully used to describe the inelastic light scattering\nin the SmB6 systems [13]. These results indicate that the spinless FKM is a quite\ngood microscopic model that can describe, at least qualitatively, many of anomalous\nfeatures of rare-earth compounds. From this point of view it seems to be interesting\nto ask if this simple model can describe also another kind of experiments performed\noften in these materials, and namely, the influence of doping on the valence transition behavior of systems. For SmB6 it has been found, for example [14, 15], that the\nsubstitution of Sm by non-magnetic divalent ions (e.g., Sr 2+ , Y b2+ ) increases the\naverage samarium valence (the average occupancy of f orbitals decreases), whereas\nthe substitution of Sm by non-magnetic trivalent ions (e.g., Y 3+ , La3+ ) produces\nthe opposite effect. In this paper we try to describe the influence of both types of\nsubstitutions on the average samarium valence within the spinless FKM.\nThe spinless FKM is based on the coexistence of two different types of electronic\nstates in given materials: localized, highly correlated ioniclike states and extended,\n2\n\n\funcorrelated, Bloch-like states. It is generally accepted that valence and insulatormetal transitions result from a change in the occupation numbers of these electronic\nstates, which remain themselves basically unchanged in their character. The Hamiltonian of the model can be written as the sum of three terms:\nH=\n\nX\n\ntij d+\ni dj + U\n\nij\n\nX\n\nfi+ fi d+\ni di + Ef\n\ni\n\nX\n\nfi+ fi ,\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere fi+ , fi are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron in the localized f state of a rare-earth atom at lattice site i with binding energy Ef and d+\ni ,\ndi are the creation and annihilation operators of the itinerant spinless electrons in\nthe d-band Wannier state at site i. The first term of (1) is the kinetic energy corresponding to quantum-mechanical hopping of the itinerant d electrons between sites\ni and j. These intersite hopping transitions are described by the matrix elements\ntij , which are \u2212t if i and j are the nearest neighbors and zero otherwise (in the\nfollowing all parameters are measured in units of t). The second term represents the\non-site Coulomb interaction between the d-band electrons (with the total number\nNd =\n\nP\n\ni\n\nd+\ni di ) and the localized f electrons (with the total number Nf =\n\nP\n\ni\n\nfi+ fi ).\n\nThe third term stands for the localized f electrons whose sharp energy level is Ef .\nThe Hamiltonian of the FKM doped by divalent (e.g., Sr 2+ ) or trivalent (e.g., Y 3+ )\nions has the same form. From the numerical point of view there is only one difference, and namely, the summation over all lattice sites (in the second and third term)\nshould be replaced by summation over the samarium positions.\nSince in the spinless version of the FKM without hybridization the f -electron\noccupation number fi+ fi of each site i commutes with the Hamiltonian (1), the f electron occupation number is a good quantum number, taking only two values:\nwi = 1 or 0, according to whether or not the site i is occupied by the localized f\nelectron. Then the Hamiltonian (1) can be written as\nH=\n\nX\n\nhij d+\ni dj + Ef\n\nX\n\nwi ,\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nij\n\nwhere hij (w) = tij + Uwi \u03b4ij .\nThus for a given f -electron configuration w = {w1 , w2 . . . wL } defined on the\none or two-dimensional lattice of L sites with periodic boundary conditions, the\n3\n\n\fHamiltonian (2) is the second-quantized version of the single-particle Hamiltonian\nh(w) = T + UW , where T is an L-square matrix with elements tij and W is the\ndiagonal matrix with elements wi . The behavior of this model at nonzero temperatures is studied using small-cluster exact-diagonalization calculations. In order to\ncompensate partially for the small size of clusters, thermal properties of the system\nare investigated via the grand canonical ensemble.\nThe grand canonical partition function of the FKM [16] can be expressed directly\nin terms of the eigenvalues \u01ebi of the single-particle operator h, which depend on the\nf -electron configuration specified by w = {wi }, i.e.,\n\u039e=\n\nX\n\ne\u2212(Ef \u2212\u03bc)Nf /\u03c4\n\nw\n\nL\nY\n\n[1 + e\u2212(\u01ebi \u2212\u03bc)/\u03c4 ].\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nThe temperature dependences (\u03c4 = kB T ) of the thermodynamic quantities are\ncalculated from this expression by using the standard statistical mechanics procedure.\nFor example, the total number of f -electrons Nf and the internal energy (E) as\nfunctions of chemical potential \u03bc are given by [17]\n\n\u2202\nln \u039e,\n\u2202Ef\n1\n\u2202\n\u2202\nE(\u03bc) =\n(\u03bc\u03c4\n\u2212\n) ln \u039e,\nL\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03b2\n\nNf (\u03bc) = \u2212\u03c4\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/\u03c4 .\nIn the next, we consider (i) the substitution of rare-earth ions (e.g., Sm) by\nnon-magnetic trivalent ions (e.g., Y 3+ ) which introduce conduction electrons into\nthe d-conduction band (one electron per dopant) and (ii) the substitution of rareearth ions by non-magnetic divalent ions (e.g., Sr 2+ ) which play a dilution role and\nreduce the number of conduction electrons in the d-conduction band (no additional\nelectrons are introduced to the system). In the first case the total number of electrons\nN = Nf + Nd is equal to the total number of lattice sites L (the case of one electron\nper rare-earth atom is considered) while in the second case N = L \u2212 X, where\nX is the total number of dopants. Thus the first step of numerical calculations\nis to determine the chemical potential corresponding to N = L and N = L \u2212 X,\nrespectively. Afterwards nf , E and other thermodynamic quantities can be calculated\n4\n\n\fnumerically.\nIt should be noted that the summation over all f electron distributions in (3)\nshould be replaced for the doped FKM by summation over all possible f -electron and\ndopant distributions, thereby strongly limiting numerical computations. Although\nthe number of configurations can be reduced considerably by the use of symmetries\nof H, there is still a limit (L \u223c 20) on the size of clusters that can be studied\nwith this method. However, we will show later that due to small sensitivity of the\nthermodynamic quantities of the FKM on L, already such small clusters can describe\nthe thermodynamics of the model very well.\nTo describe effects of doping by divalent and trivalent ions on the average f -state\noccupancy of rare-earth ions we have performed an exhaustive study of the model for\na wide range of model parameters U, \u03c4, Ef . The typical dependences of the average\nf -orbital occupancy nf = Nf /(L \u2212 X) on the dopant concentration x = X/L are\ndisplayed in Fig. 1 for Ef = 0, U = 0.5 and several different temperatures \u03c4 .\n\n1\na\n\n0.9\n\nb\n\nL=12\n\nc\n\nL=16\n0.8\n\nd\n\nL=20\n\n0.7\n3\n\n0.6\n\n2.8\nSm valence\n\nnf\n\ntrivalent ions\n0.5\ndivalent ions\n0.4\n\nSr\nYb\n\n2.6\n\nY\n2.4\n\nLa\n\n2.2\n2\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\nU=0.5\nD=1\nEf=0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\nd\n\nc\na\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nb\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: The average occupancy of f orbitals as a function of x for doping by divalent and trivalent ions calculated for L = 12, 16, 20 and several different temperatures\n\u03c4 . Curve a, \u03c4 = 0.1; curve b, \u03c4 = 0.3; curve c, \u03c4 = 0.6; curve d, \u03c4 = 1. Inset: The\naverage samarium valence in the Sm1\u2212x Mx B6 systems (M = Y 3+ , La3+ , Sr 2+ , Y b2+ )\nmeasured at 300 K (Ref. 14).\n5\n\n\fTo determine the finite-size effects all concentration dependences have been calculated for several cluster sizes (L = 12, 16, 20) and displayed on the common linear\nscale. We have found that for all examined temperatures \u03c4 the finite-size effects are\nnegligible (over the whole range of x plotted) and thus these results can be used\nsatisfactorily to represent the behavior of macroscopic systems. It is seen that the\nsubstitution of rare-earth ions by trivalent and divalent ions produces fully different\neffects. While in the first case the average occupancy of f -orbitals increases with\nincreasing dopant concentration x, in the second case nf decreases. In all examined\ncases the valence transition realizes continuously. Comparing these results with experimental measurements of the average samarium valence v (see inset in Fig. 1) in\nthe Sm1\u2212x Mx B6 systems [14, 15] (M = Y 3+ , La3+ , Sr 2+ , Y b2+ ) one can find a good\nqualitative agreement between the theoretical and experimental results. Indeed, the\nsubstitution of Sm by non-magnetic divalent ions (Sr 2+ , Y b2+ ) increases the average samarium valence (the average occupancy of f orbitals nf = 3 \u2212 v decreases),\nwhereas the substitution of Sm by non-magnetic trivalent ions (Y 3+ , La3+ ) produces\nthe opposite effect. These results again indicate that the FKM, in spite of its relative simplicity could, in principle, yield the correct physics for describing rare-earth\ncompounds. Even, also small quantitative deviations between the experimental and\ntheoretical results can be straightforwardly improved within the FKM by optimizing\nthe nf (x) behavior with respect to \u03c4 and Ef . This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the xdependence of the f -orbital occupancy is plotted for \u03c4 = 1 (this relatively large value\nis chosen to ensure that \u03c4 is much greater than the spacing of many-body energylevels for both D = 1 and D = 2) and several different values of Ef . It is seen that\nfor nonzero values of Ef a nice correspondence between the theoretical and experimental results can be achieved. Of course, one can take objection that real materials\nare three dimensional, while our results have been obtained for the one dimensional\ncase. Unfortunately, due to limitations (mentioned above) on the size of clusters that\ncan be treated exactly by small-cluster exact-diagonalization calculations (L = 20)\nwe are not able to obtain any exact results in three dimensions. However, in two\ndimensions there are several finite clusters with L = 10, 16, 18, 20 that are accessible to exact-diagonalization calculations [18] and can be used to test the stability\nof obtained results with increasing dimension.

The experimental results have been obtained\nfor T=300 K.\nhave performed in two dimensions (for the same set of model parameters as in D=1\nand the above mentioned cluster sizes) showed (see Fig. 3) that the f -occupancy\nof rare-earth orbitals depends only very weakly on the dimension of the system.\nThus we can conclude that the spinless FKM, when treated exactly, can provide a\nreasonable theoretical description of valence transitions induced by doping in some\nrare-earth compounds, e.g., the samarium hexaboride solid solutions Sm1\u2212x Mx B6\n(M = Y 3+ , La3+ , Sr 2+ , Y b2+ ). Of course, this statement can not be extended automatically on all thermodynamics characteristics of the doped FKM. For example, to\ndo quantitative comparison between the theoretical and experimental results for the\nspecific heat and the magnetic susceptibility, the model should be first generalized\nby including the spin and orbital dynamics that description was too simplified in the\nHamiltonian (1). The work in this direction is currently in progress.\nIn summary, the extrapolation of small-cluster exact-diagonalization calculations\n7\n\n\f3\n\n3\n\na)\n\nb)\n2.8\n\nSr\nYb\n\n2.6\n\nv=3\u2212nf\n\nv=3\u2212n\n\nf\n\n2.8\n\nY\n2.4\n\nLa\n\n2.2\n\nSr\nYb\n\n2.6\n\nY\n2.4\n\nLa\n\n2.2\n\nE =0.3, U=0.5, D=2, \u03c4=1\n\nE =0.6, U=0.5, D=2, \u03c4=1\n\nf\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nf\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n3\n\n2.8\n\nSr\nYb\n\n2.6\n\nv=3\u2212nf\n\nf\n\n1\n\nd)\n\n2.8\n\nv=3\u2212n\n\n0.8\n\n3\n\nc)\n\nY\n2.4\n\nLa\n\n2.2\n\nSr\nYb\n\n2.6\n\nY\n2.4\n\nLa\n\n2.2\n\nE =0.8, U=0.5, D=2, \u03c4=1\n\nE =1, U=0.5, D=2, \u03c4=1\n\nf\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\nx\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nf\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\n1\n\nx\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of the two-dimensional theoretical (dashed lines) and experimental results for the average Sm valence v = 3 \u2212 nf as a function of x.

Again, the finite-size effects are negligible.\nwas used to study the influence of doping on valence transitions in the spinless FKM\nat nonzero temperatures. Two types of doping were examined, and namely, the\nsubstitution of rare-earth ions by non-magnetic ions that introduce (i) one or (ii)\nnone additional electron (per non-magnetic ion) into the conduction band. It was\nfound that the first type of substitution increases the average f -state occupancy of\nrare-earth ions, whereas the second type of substitution has the opposite effect. In\nall examined cases valence changes are continuous. The results obtained were used\nto describe valence transition behavior of samarium in the hexaboride solid solutions\nSm1\u2212x Mx B6 (M = Y 3+ , La3+ , Sr 2+ , Y b2+ ) and a very good agreement of theoretical\nand experimental results was found.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Grant Agency VEGA under Grant No.\n2/4060/04 and the Science and Technology Assistance Agency under Grant APVT20-021602.\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] L.M.
