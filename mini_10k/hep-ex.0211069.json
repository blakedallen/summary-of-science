Mart\u0131\u0301nez\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n(on behalf of the CDF Collaboration)\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Run 2 at Tevatron will define a new level of precision for QCD studies in\nhadron collisions. Both collider experiments, CDF and D0, expect to collect\nup to 15 fb\u22121 of data in this new run period. The increase in instantaneous\nluminosity, center-of-mass energy (from 1.8 TeV to 2 TeV) and the improved\nacceptance of the detectors will allow stringent tests of the Standard Model\n(SM) predictions in extended regions of jet transverse energy, ETjet , and jet\npseudorapidity, \u03b7 jet .\nIn the following, a review of some of the most important QCD results\nfrom Run 1 is presented, together with first preliminary Run 2 measurements (based on the very first data collected by the experiment) and future\nprospects as the integrated luminosity increases.\n\n2\n\nInclusive Jet Production\n\nThe CDF Run 1 inclusive jet cross section measurements [1], performed for\njets in the region 0.1 < |\u03b7 jet | < 0.7 and ETjet > 50 GeV, showed an excess\nwith respect to the NLO calculation in the region ETjet > 300 GeV which\ninitially suggested a possible signal for new physics (see Fig. 1-left). However, a detailed revision of theoretical uncertainties in the NLO calculations\nindicates that the SM predictions at high-ETjet suffer from large uncertainties mainly due to the little knowledge of the proton's gluon distribution at\nhigh-x. The CTEQ Collaboration showed that it is possible to describe the\nCDF measurements (see Fig. 1-right) by increasing the amount of gluons in\nthe proton at high-x (x > 0.3) without affecting the good description of the\nrest of the data used in the global fits like, for example, the very precise DIS\ndata. Nowadays, the Tevatron high-ETjet data, although still has very little\nstatistical power, is being used, together with prompt-photon data from fixed\ntarget experiments, to constrain the gluon distribution at high-x.\nThe new Run 2 data will allow better and more precise jet measurements.\nThe increase in the center-of-mass energy will extend the measured cross\nsections from ETjet \u223c 450 GeV to ETjet \u223c 600 GeV, and re-explore possible\ndeviations from the SM predictions.

Forward jet measurements\nare not expected to have any contribution from new physics due to the fact\nthat the maximum reachable ETjet is limited to ETjet \u223c 200 GeV, but have a\nsensitivity to the proton's gluon distribution similar to that of the central jet\nmeasurements.\n\n2\n\n1994-95\n1992-93\n\n10\n\nStatistical Errors only\n\nNLO QCD prediction (EKS)\n-1\n\nCTEQ4M\n50\n0\n\n1\n\n-50\n100\n\nCTEQ4HJ\n\ncteq4m \u03bc=Et/2 Rsep=1.3\n\n10\n\n100\n\n50\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n-3\n\n10\n\n-50\n100\n\nMRST\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n50\n-5\n\nStatistical Errors Only\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nTransverse Energy (GeV)\n\n-50\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nJet Transverse Energy\n\n400\n\nGeV\n\nFig. 1.

The measurement is compared to NLO QCD predictions.(Right) Ratio (Data - Theory)/Theory for the measured jet cross section\nwhere different parton density functions are considered in the theoretical predictions.\n\nThe CDF Run 1 analyses used the cone algorithm [2] to search for jets,\ndefine jet observables and measure jet cross sections. During the past few\nyears different theoretical problems of the cone algorithm were pointed out,\nnamely: the infrared and collinear sensitivity of the defined cross sections and\nthe difficulty to translate the experimental prescription for merging jets to\nan equivalent procedure at the parton level in theoretical calculations. The\nlongitudinally invariant KT algorithm [3], initially used in e+ e\u2212 collisions,\nwas proposed for ep and pp(pp) experiments [4]. It has been already used\nby the DIS experiments at HERA [5] with so great success that the cone\nalgorithm has been abandoned. Therefore, one of the main goal of the QCD\nprogram at Tevatron in Run 2 will be the study of the performance of KT\nalgorithms in a hadron-hadron environment.\n\n\fJet Production at CDF\n\n3\n\n3\n\nThree-jet Production\n\nCDF recently presented a measurement of inclusive three-jet production compared to NLO calculations based on Run 1 data. Jets were searched for using\na cone algorithm with radius R=0.7. The events were required to have at\nleast three jets with ETjet > 20 GeV and |\u03b7 jet | < 2.0. In order to compare\nwith NLO calculations, additional cuts were applied. The sum of the transverse energy of the jets was required to be above 320 GeV and a cut on the\nminimum separation between jets of 1.0 unit (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space) was used.\nThe topology of the three-jet final state was studied using Dalitz variables\nin the center-of-mass of the three-jet system:\nXi =\n\n2 * Eijet\n, i = 3, 4, 5\nM3jets\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M3jets denotes the invariant mass of the three jets and the jets are\nsorted in energy in such a way that X3 > X4 > X5 , where X3 + X4 + X5 \u2261 2.\nFigure 2-left shows the distribution of the measured three-jet events in the\n(X3 \u2212 X4 ) plane. Different event topologies are observed, including MercedesBenz Star type of events with X3 \u223c 0.7 and X4 \u223c 0.7. However, the topologies\nare dominated by those configurations with a soft third jet where X3,4 \u223c 0.95.\nCDF: Preliminary\n\n(Data-NLO)/NLO\n\nNumber of Events\n\nCDF: Preliminary\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n1\n0.9\n\nX\n\n4\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5 0.6 0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\nX3\n\n1.0\n0\n-1.0\n\n0.72 < X4 \u2264 0.74\n\n1.0\n0\n-1.0\n\n0.70 < X4 \u2264 0.72\n\n1.0\n0\n-1.0\n\n0.68 < X4 \u2264 0.70\n\n1.0\n0\n-1.0\n\n0.66 < X4 \u2264 0.68\n\n1.0\n0\n-1.0\n\n0.64 < X4 \u2264 0.66\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\nX3\n\nFig. 2.

Jets were searched for using a cone algorithm with R=0.7 starting\nfrom the energy deposits in the calorimeter towers, and the jet variables\nwere reconstructed according to the Snowmass convection. The integrated\njet shape, \u03a8 (r), is defined as the average fraction of the transverse energy of\njet with lies inside an cone of radius r concentric to the jet cone:\nP\nET (0, r)\n1\n, \u03a8 (r = R) = 1,\n(2)\n\u03a8 (r) =\nNjets\nETjet\nwhere the sum runs over the calorimeter towers belonging to the jet.\n\nFig. 3. Measured integrated jet shape, \u03a8 (r), computed using both calorimeter towers (back dots) and tracks (open circles) for jets in the region 0.1 < |\u03b7 jet | < 0.7 and\n30 < ETjet < 135 GeV. The measurements are compared to HERWIG predictions\nincluding CDF detector simulation.\n\nIn addition, for jet with 0.1 < |\u03b7 jet | < 0.7, the jet shapes were measured\nusing tracks and a similar expression as Eq. 2 where ETjet was substituted by\nthe scalar sum of the tracks inside the cone of the jet. Figure 3 shows the\n\n\fJet Production at CDF\n\n5\n\nmeasured jet shapes using both calorimeter towers and tracks compared to\nthe predictions from HERWIG MC [7]. The measurements performed using\ncalorimeter and tracking are in excellent agreement. For a given fixed distance\nr0 , the measured \u03a8 (r = r0 ) increases with ETjet indicating that the jets become\nnarrower. The measured jets shapes are well described by the HERWIG MC\npredictions. Similar studies with b-tagged jets will be necessary to test our\nknowledge of b-quark jet fragmentation processes in hadronic interactions,\nwhich is essential for future precise Top and Higgs measurements.\n\n5\n\nStudy of the Underlying Event\n\nThe hadronic final states from QCD processes in pp collisions at Tevatron are\ncharacterized by the presence of soft underlying emissions, usually denoted as\nunderlying event, in addition to highly energetic jets coming from the hard\ninteraction. The underlying event contains contributions from initial- and\nfinal-state soft gluon radiation, secondary semi-hard partonic interactions\nand interactions between the proton and anti-proton remnants that cannot\nbe described by perturbation theory. These processes must be approximately\nmodeled using MC programs tuned to describe the data.\nCharged Jet #1\nDirection\n\u0093Toward-Side\u0094 Jet\n\n\u0093Toward\u0094\n\n\u0093Transverse\u0094\n\n\u0093Transverse\u0094\n\n\u0093Away\u0094\n\n\"Transverse\" Nchg versus PT(charged jet#1)\n\"Transverse\" <Nchg> in 1 GeV/c bin\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n5\n\nCDF\n\n4\n\ndata uncorrected\ntheory corrected\n\n3\n2\n1\n1.8 TeV |\u03b7\n\u03b7|<1.0 PT>0.5 GeV/c\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u0093Away-Side\u0094 Jet\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nPT(charged jet#1) (GeV/c)\nHerwig\n\nIsajet\n\nPythia 6.115\n\nCDF Min-Bias\n\nCDF JET20\n\nFig. 4.

The measurements are compared to different MC\nmodels.\n\nThe jet energies measured in the detector contain an underlying event\ncontribution that has to be subtracted in order to compare the measurements\nto pQCD predictions. Therefore, a proper understanding of this underlying\nevent contribution is crucial to reach the desired precision in the measured jet\n\n\f6\n\nAuthors Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n\ncross sections. In the analysis presented here [8], the underlying event in dijet\nevents was studied by looking at regions well separated from the leading jets,\nwhere its contribution is expected to dominate the observed hadronic activity.\nJets were reconstructed using tracks with ptrack\n> 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7 track | < 1\nT\nand a cone algorithm (Snowmass convection) with R=0.7 in the (\u03b7 \u2212\u03c6) space.\nJets were sorted in PTjet and the leading jet defined the direction \u03c6 = 0. The\n\u03c6 space around the leading jet was divided in three regions: towards, away\nand transverse (see Fig. 3-left), and the transverse region was assumed to\nreflect the underlying event contribution. Figure 4-right shows the average\ntrack multiplicity in the transverse region as a function of PTjet of the leading\njet. The observed plateau indicates that the underlying event activity is, to\na large extend, independent from the hard interaction. Figure 4-right shows\nthe comparison with different MC predictions with default parameters. It\nbecomes clear that the measured track multiplicities provide the necessary\ninput to tune the different parameters of the underlying-event models.\n\n6\n\nStudy of W+Njet Production\n\nA detailed study of hard processes involving the associated production of a\nW boson and a given number of jets in the final state is a main goal of the\nCDF physics program in Run 2. These processes constitute the biggest background to Top and Higgs production in hadron colliders. Therefore, precise\nmeasurements of W+Njets cross sections will be essential to test the NLO\nQCD calculations used in order to estimate QCD-related backgrounds to\nTop/Higgs signals.\n\n10 4\nCDF Preliminary Data (108 pb-1)\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n10 3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10 3 (b)\n\n2\n\nVECBOS QREN,FAC = MV + pTV\n\n(b)\n\n(a) ET1 (W + \u22651 Jet)\n(b) ET2 (W + \u22652 Jets)\n(c) ET3 (W + \u22653 Jets)\n(d) ET4 (W + \u22654 Jets)\n\n(c)\n\n10 2\n\nEvents / 5 GeV\n\nBR \u22c5 Cross Section (pb)\n\n+ CDF Preliminary Data (108 pb-1)\n\u2212 VECBOS + HERWIG Fragmentation\n+ Detector Simulation\n2\n2\nCTEQ3M, Q = < pT >\n(Normalized to data)\n\n(a)\n\nVECBOS QREN,FAC = < pT >2\n\n10\n\n10 2\n(d)\n\n10\n\n1\n(a) \u03c3(W + \u2265n Jets) \u22c5 BR(W \u2192 e\u03bd)\n\n1\n\n+ \u2212\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n(b) \u03c3(Z + \u2265n Jets) \u22c5 BR(Z \u2192 e e )\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nJet Multiplicity (\u2265n Jets)\n\n4\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nJet ET (GeV)\n\nFig. 5.

(Right) ETjet spectrum of the less\nenergetic jet in W + Njet production compared to VECBOS+HERWIG predictions.\n\n\fJet Production at CDF\n\n7\n\nIn Run 1, CDF measured the cross section for W+Njet production with\nNjet \u2264 4 [9]. The measurements were compared to an enhanced leading-order\nprediction based on leading-order calculations (as implemented in VECBOS\n[10]) interfaced to HERWIG for additional gluon radiation and hadronization,\nsee Fig. 5-left. The measured cross sections were described by the calculations\nthat, however, show a large renormalization scale uncertainty. The ETjet distribution for the less energetic jet in W+Njet events (see Fig. 5-right) which\nis sensitive to the additional gluon radiation from HERWIG, was also well\ndescribed by the enhanced leading-order prediction.\nDuring the last years a number of new Boson+Njet programs have become available [11] which include larger jet multiplicities in the final state, in\naddition to NLO calculations for the W+dijet case. These different programs\nare being interfaced to parton-shower models and will make possible precise\ncomparison with Tevatron data as the recorded luminosity of the experiments\nincreases. These measurements will become the testing ground for a future\ndiscovery of new particles either at Tevatron or at the LHC.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n\nT.
