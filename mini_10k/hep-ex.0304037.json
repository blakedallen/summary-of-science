This analysis allows a test of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, relying on the\ndistortion of the muon energy distribution. These results have been combined with those coming from the upward\nthroughgoing muon angular distribution only. Both analyses are independent of the neutrino flux normalization\nand provide strong evidence, above the 4\u03c3 level, in favour of neutrino oscillations.\nPACS: 14.60Lm,14.60.Pq, 25.30.Mr\n\n\f1. Introduction\nThe results obtained by experiments looking\nfor neutrinos coming from natural or artificial far\nsources gave the first indication of physics beyond\nthe standard model. Neutrino flavor changing is\nin fact the most straightforward explanation for\nelectron and muon neutrino disappearance and\nfor the evidence of non electron neutrinos from\nthe sun. In this scenario, the study of atmospheric neutrinos plays an important role to improve our understanding of the neutrino oscillation mechanism.\nThe MACRO detector studied [1,2,3] three categories of events as shown in Fig. 1: (1) upward\nthroughgoing muons, (2) upward semicontained\nmuons, and (3+4) upward stopping muons plus\ndownward semicontained muons. The (3+4) categories cannot be separated experimentally, because the events have only one time measurement.\nHowever, upward stopping muons and downward\nsemicontained muons have similar parent neutrino energy.\nAn atmospheric muon neutrino deficit was\nfound in all of the three categories and an angular distribution distortion was found in category\n(1). Such results are explained by the neutrino\noscillation hypothesis with parameters \u2206m2 =\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 and sin2 2\u03b8=1, in good agree0a\n\nAlso INFN Milano, 20133 Milano, Italy\nb Also IASF/CNR, Sez. di Bologna, Italy\nc Also Department of Physics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16801, USA\nd Also Universit\u00e0 di Trieste and INFN, 34100 Trieste, Italy\ne Also U.

The different\ncategories of events quoted above have median\nenergy from 4 GeV to 50 GeV, which provides evidence of the dependence on neutrino energies, as\nrequired by the oscillation hypothesis. In this paper we address for the first time the estimate of\nthe upward throughgoing muon energy by using\nmultiple scattering. The implementation of this\nmethod to the MACRO data is discussed in Section 2. Two different analysis were performed.\nThe first one, using the tracking system in digital\nmode, is described in Section 3. Section 4 shows\nthe results obtained with the streamer tube in\n\n\fdrift mode, where electronic readout of the hit\ntime was used to improve the position resolution\nand thereby the range of muon energies that could\nbe estimated.\n2. The muon energy estimate\nThe MACRO detector was extensively described in [7]. The detector consisted of a lower\nhalf (the lower detector) and an upper half (the\n\"Attico\"). The lower detector had 10 horizontal planes of streamer tubes separated by either\ncrushed rock absorbers (60 g/cm2 ) or (at its top\nand bottom) a plane of scintillator counters. The\nAttico had 4 horizontal planes of streamer tubes\nseparated into two groups with a plane of scintillator counters between them.\nUpward throughgoing muons are mainly produced in neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS)\nin the rock below the detector. The recoil hadrons\nare lost and the muon energy is degraded in the\npropagation to the detector. Nevertheless, Monte\nCarlo simulations show a linear relation between\nthe parent neutrino energy E\u03bd and the muon\nresidual energy E\u03bc at detector level.\nThe momentum resolution obtainable from\nmultiple coulomb scattering (MCS) measurements is the result of two different contributions:\nthe number of sampling planes N and the space\nresolution of the detector \u03c30 . In MACRO the\nnumber of tracking planes interleaved with rock\nabsorbers gives N = 8. The resolution of the\nstreamer tube system used in digital mode is\n\u03c30 \u22431 cm and was improved to \u03c30 \u22430.3 cm by using the drift time. The other six horizontal tracking planes are separated by a negligible amount\nof material, and do not contribute to the MCS\nmeasurements.\nIn a tracking detector with equispaced tracking planes, separated by a given absorber and\nneglecting the energy losses, the characteristic\nmomentum scale can be written as [8]:\np\n0.015\u2206 \u2206/X0\npMCS (GeV) =\n\u03c30\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the distance between tracking planes\nand X0 is the material radiation length. For\n\np<pMCS , the main limitation to the momentum\nreconstruction comes from the number of sampling planes while for p>pMCS the space resolution dominates. Under the conditions quoted\nabove the relative momentum error [8] can be\nwritten as:\n\u03c3p\n1\n\u2192\u221a\n(3)\np\n2N\nfor p<<pMCS , and\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\np\n\u03c3p\n\u2192\u221a\n,\np\n2N pMCS\n\n(4)\n\nfor p>>pMCS . As shown in [8] the 1/p distribution approaches a Gaussian only for N\u226530;\ntherefore the momentum error for MACRO is\nnot expected to have a Gaussian behaviour. The\neight horizontal streamer tube planes interleaved\nwith rock absorbers (planes 2 to 9, from the bottom) are equispaced and have the same space\nresolution, hence pMACRO\n=2.2 GeV/c. Since\nMCS\nabout 90% of upward throughgoing muons have\np > 2.2 GeV/c, the intrinsic chamber resolution\ndominates. The MCS-based momentum estimates scale therefore as the square of the space\nresolution \u03c3o .\nThe r.m.s. of the lateral displacement of a relativistic muon crossing a layer of material with\ndepth X is proportional to the inverse of muon\nmomentum p\u03bc [9]:\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX 13.6 MeV X\nX\nMCS\n\u03c3proj\n\u2243 \u221a\n1 + 0.038 ln\n.(5)\nXo\nXo\n3 p\u03bc \u03b2c\nIn MACRO, X\u224325Xo/cos \u0398, giving on the vertiMCS\ncal \u03c3proj\n\u224310 cm/E\u03bc (GeV). Therefore, a saturation point above 10 GeV requires a space resolution better than 1 cm. An improvement in the\nspace resolution increases the maximum energy\nvalue (saturation point) above which the MCS\nmethod is not effective.\nConsequently we decided to improve the\nstreamer tube resolution: in the second analysis,\ndescribed in Section 4, we took advantage of the\nQTP-TDC electronics, developed for magnetic\nmonopole searches [7]. In this case, we obtained\nan improved space resolution, \u03c3x \u223c0.3 cm[11],\nwhich allowed us to estimate the muon energy\nup to E\u03bc \u224340 GeV.\n\n\fFor both analyses, we used the whole sample\nof upward throughgoing muon events collected\nwith the complete apparatus in a period of data\ntaking equivalent to 5.5 years of live time. We\nstudied upward muon events selected by the timeof-flight measured by planes of scintillators combined with the standard MACRO tracking algorithm. The original upward throughgoing muon\ndata set has been described previously [3]. To\nmake a comparison between real data and expectation we performed a Monte Carlo simulation using the Bartol neutrino flux [12] and the\nGRV94 DIS parton distributions [13] for deep inelastic scattering. For low energy neutrino interactions we used the cross sections given in [14].\nThe energy loss for muons propagating through\nrock is taken from Lohmann et al. [15] while\nthe muon simulation inside the detector was performed with GMACRO (the GEANT 3.21 based\ndetector simulation). For the second analysis,\nwhere the streamer system is used in drift mode,\nanother simulation chain has been implemented.\nIn this case neutrino interactions are randomly\ndistributed in a rock semi-sphere below the detector. Muons are then transported to the detector using the FLUKA99 package[6]. A Monte\nCarlo statistics corresponding to a live time of\n\u22432700 years was produced (500 equivalent experiments). This simulation was compared with that\nused in[1,3], obtaining a satisfactory result.\n3. The first analysis:\ndigital mode\n\nstreamer tubes in\n\nBecause of MCS in the lower detector, with\nthis analysis we expect a measurable deflection\nbetween the incoming and the outgoing track directions for muons with energies smaller than\n\u223c10 GeV. This corresponds to an effective armlever of \u223c4 m between the lower detector and the\nAttico[7].\nThe eight lowest streamer tube planes were\nused, through a track refit, to estimate the direction of the incoming muon. The five upper\nstreamer tube planes in the lower detector and\nthe four Attico planes were used to estimate the\ndirection of the outgoing muon. The distance rw\nbetween the intercepts of the two tracks in the\n\nz = 0 plane, and the difference \u2206\u03a6 between the\ntwo slopes depend on the muon energy E\u03bc . We\ndivided the upward throughgoing muons in three\nsub samples, according to the values of rw and\n\u2206\u03a6: sample L= Low energy, if rw >3 cm and\n\u2206\u03a6 > 0.3\u25e6 ; H= High energy if rw \u22643 cm and\n\u2206\u03a6 \u2264 0.3\u25e6 . The remaining events were classified as M=Medium Energy. These cuts were optimized using two large samples of real atmospheric\nmuons: i) downward throughgoing (average energy of \u223c 300 GeV [16]), and ii) downward going\nstopping muons (average energy of \u223c1 GeV).\nThe aforementioned cuts were applied on the\nupward throughgoing muons (crossing the whole\napparatus, lower detector + Attico), both real and\nsimulated. They were selected from the same\nanalysis chain [1] and had the same data format. From the simulation we expect 430 events:\n178 of Low energy, with <E\u03bd >=11 GeV, 59 of\nMedium energy, with <E\u03bd >=33 GeV and 193 of\nHigh energy, with <E\u03bd >=72 GeV. From the real\ndata, 316 events were selected: 101 of Low, 51 of\nMedium and 164 of High energy.\nThe L and H events were further divided according to their zenith angle \u0398: events from the\nvertical direction \u22121. < cos \u0398 < \u22120.8, and events\nwith cos \u0398 > \u22120.8. For each event topology the\nnumber of detected and expected events were determined and ordered with decreasing value of the\n<L\u03bd >/ <E\u03bd > (<L\u03bd >= average value of neutrino\npath length). The relative systematic uncertainty\non each of the five <L\u03bd >/<E\u03bd > values is 12.5%,\ncoming from the uncertainties on the neutrino\nspectrum and angular shape (discussed in Sect.\n4.3), from the detector related effects and analysis cuts. This includes the number of planes used\nfor the refit, the definition of the cuts, the fluctuations in the streamer tube and scintillator efficiencies, and detector acceptance uncertainties.\nWe evaluated \u03c72 for the hypothesis of no neutrino oscillations using the five <L\u03bd >/<E\u03bd >\nbins, plus the additional point from the analysis\nof semi contained upward going events (IU) [2]\n(upgoing neutrinos with <E\u03bd >\u223c4 GeV). We\nfound that the distribution agrees with the no oscillation hypothesis with a probability lower than\n2%). For two-flavor oscillations with parameters\n\u2206m2 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV 2 and sin2 2\u03b8 = 1 we get a\n\n\fprobability of 45%.\n\nThe performance of the streamer tube system,\nread out in drift mode, is described in [11]. Here\nan absolute muon energy calibration was performed at the PS-T9 and SPS-X7 beams, where\na slice of the MACRO detector was reproduced.\nThe MCS information was handled by a neural\nnetwork, based on JETNET 3.0[17], calibrated\nwith the muon beams quoted above. The neural network(NN) output obtained using test beam\ndata, was compared with that expected from the\nMonte Carlo simulation, obtaining a satisfactory\nagreement[11]. The application of such analysis to the MACRO data resulted in an improvement of the space resolution from \u03c3x \u22431 cm to\n\u03c3x \u22430.3 cm.\nFigure 2 shows the Monte Carlo prediction for\nNN downward throughgoing muons and downward going stopping muons compared with experimental data. A nice agreement between simulation and real data is found for both categories,\nrepresenting a large energy interval.\nThe result of the neural network output energy\ncalibration shows that NN output is almost linear\nwith log10 (E\u03bc ), increasing with the muon energy\nup to E\u03bc \u224340 GeV, where a saturation effect occurs. With respect to the approach used in[11]\nfew details of the neural network were optimized:\nthe neural network training and the energy calibration was performed separately for events with\nhits in the upper part of the detector(Attico).\nAlthough smeared by the energy carried away\nby hadrons and by energy loss in the rock, the detected neutrino induced muons still carry on average \u224340% of the original neutrino energy. By\nusing the full Monte Carlo simulation quoted in\nSect. 2, we calibrated the NN output as a function of log10 (E\u03bd ): the calibrated NN output is linear up to log10 (E\u03bd (GeV))\u22432.15. We may write:\n\u03b4 log10 (E\u03bd ) = log10 (e) \u03b4 ln E\u03bd = log10 (e)\n\n\u03b4E\u03bd\n, (6)\nE\u03bd\n\nwhere \u03b4 log10 (E\u03bd ) is the difference between the\nlog10 of the real and of the reconstructed neutrino\n\nNumber of events\n\n4.

Taking into account that the NN output was calibrated as a function of log10 (E\u03bd ), the\nenergy resolution \u03b4E\u03bd /E\u03bd was obtained by plotting the quantity \u03b4 log10 (E\u03bd )/log10 (e). In Fig. 3\nwe show the resolution that could be obtained\nwith an ideal muon energy resolution(dotted\nline) and that obtained with the present analysis(continuous line). The precision of the neutrino energy estimate obtained with an ideal\nmuon energy resolution detector is \u03b4E\u03bd /E\u03bd \u224370%,\nwhile with the present method a resolution of\n\u03b4E\u03bd /E\u03bd \u2243150% is obtained. The asymmetry\npresent in both curves comes from neutrino interactions occurring far from the detector, for which\na large fraction of the muon energy is lost during\nthe transport.\n4.1. Data Selection\nWe used the 783 upward throughgoing muon\ndata set collected in the full detector run started\nin 1994. Table 1 describes further event selection\nto arrive at the sample for MCS analysis. We required a single track in both the wire and the strip\nview.

This\ncut is effective for muon tracks with large zenith\nangles (\u0398 > 30\u25e6 ), while it is quite loose around\nthe vertical: we restricted the present analysis to\nevents with \u0398\u226460\u25e6. Comparisons were performed\nbetween simulated and experimental downward\ngoing muon data, to ensure that the selection efficiency, in the used angular window, is the same\nin the Monte Carlo and in the real data. Spurious background hits have been avoided by requiring a time window of 2 \u03bcs around the trigger\ntime. Finally, we selected events with at least\nfour streamer tube planes with valid QTP-TDC\ndata. We fitted the drift circles using the same\ntracking developed to analyse test beam muons.\nA minimum path length of 200 cm in the lower\ndetector is required for tracks hitting the Attico\nand 400 cm for tracks not hitting it. These geometric requirement ensure a minimum depth of\nmaterial where muons may experience a measurable amount of multiple scattering and a lever\narm long enough for a comfortable tracking. After the selection cuts 300 events survived, giving\nan overall efficiency of 38.3%.\n\n4.2. Qualitative tests\nWe used the information provided by the neural network to separate the neutrino events into\nfour energy subsamples, as shown in Table 2.

The resolution on the ratio\nL\u03bd /E\u03bd is therefore fully dominated by the uncertainty in the neutrino energy estimate, giving a\nrelative error of \u2243 150%.

Experimental results\nTo quantify the contribution of the multiple\nscattering measurement in stand-alone mode, we\nperformed a blind analysis using the Monte Carlo\ndata, looking for the variable, based on the energy estimate, showing the maximum sensitivity\nto separate the oscillation from the no-oscillation\nhypothesis.

Due to the large uncertainty in the absolute flux [18,19,20,21], we use in this paper only\nthe angular distribution and the ratio between\ndifferent event categories selected according to\nthe reconstructed energy. Nevertheless, the theoretical uncertainty of the existing neutrino flux,\nbased on the old CR spectrum[12], has to be accounted for. We varied the input primary cosmic ray spectral index \u03b3 in our simulation by\n\u2206\u03b3=\u00b10.05,\nobtaining a theoretical error on R,\n\u0001\n\u2206R\n=\u00b113%.\nR f lux\nAnother source of systematics comes from the\nneutrino cross section. We looked at R varying the Monte Carlo input cross sections. The\nmost important contribution to the error comes\nfrom the \"Low\" category, since the cross section\nat low neutrino energy is more uncertain. By\ncomparing the cross section computed under several hypotheses, varying for instance the structure function ([13],[23]) in the deep inelastic scattering, including or neglecting the contribution\n\u0001\nof resonant scattering, we found \u2206R\n%.\nR \u03c3 =9\n\u0001\n\u2206R\nWe estimated a total theoretical error R theo =\nq\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2206R 2\n\u2206R 2\nR f lux +\nR \u03c3 =16%.

As pointed out in[3],\nthe ratio does not have a Gaussian distribution.\nThe errors on the ratio are therefore also not\nGaussian: they are reported just to give a crude\nestimates of the significance. The experimental\nratio is Rexp =0.85\u00b10.16(stat.). The one sided\nprobability of measuring a value smaller than the\nmeasured one, was computed by using two different methods. In the first one we let the Monte\nCarlo simulation (no oscillations) to fluctuate according to statistical and systematic errors of the\nconsidered ratio. We then evaluated the fraction\nof events giving a value smaller than the measured one. In a more pessimistic view, rejecting\nthe hypothesis that the lower number of events\ndetected by MACRO with respect to the Monte\nCarlo expectation is due to oscillation effects, the\ntotal number of Monte Carlo events (sum of the\n\n\f2\n\n\u2206m (eV )\n\n1: Angular distribution\n\n2\n\nnumerator and the denominator in the ratios),\nwere normalized to the experimentally measured\nsum and then they were allowed to fluctuate.\nThe corresponding one sided probability of\nmeasuring a value smaller than Rexp according\nto method 1 (2) is 0.75%(1.9%) corresponding to\n2.4\u03c3(2.1 \u03c3). Finally, we combined the information coming from the energy estimate and from\nthe angular distribution. We considered the ratio:\nA = Nvert /Nhor ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Nvert is the number of upward throughgoing muon events with cos \u03b8\u2264-0.7 and Nhor is\nthe number of events with cos \u03b8\u2265-0.4, as discussed in [3]. The probability of measuring\na value A\u2032 lower than Aexp according to the\nmethod 1 (2) is P(A'<Aexp )=0.001%(0.01%),\ncorresponding to 4.3 \u03c3(3.7\u03c3). It is worth noting that, combining the two independent probabilities on the ratios R and A, the probability\nthat a fluctuation of the expected values(no oscillations) generates the experimental results is\nP(A\u2032 *R\u2032 <Aexp *Rexp )=1.3\u00d710\u22126(3.2\u00d710\u22125), corresponding to 4.7 \u03c3(4 \u03c3).\nThe 90% confidence level allowed regions in the\noscillation parameter space have been computed\naccording to the prescription given in [24]. Figure 7 shows the 90% C.L. for the ratio R, the angular distribution [3] and for their combination.\n5. Conclusions\nMuon multiple coulomb scattering has been\nused to estimate the energy of the neutrino induced upward throughgoing muons detected by\nMACRO. The different tests performed on the\ndata, using the estimated energy (separation in\nsubsamples with different energies, L\u03bd /E\u03bd estimates, etc.) give a consistent picture, all of\nthem supporting the neutrino oscillation hypothesis with parameters \u2206m2 = 2.5\u00d710\u22123eV 2 and\nsin2 2\u03b8\u22431. To quantify such effect, the ratio\nR = Nlow /Nhigh was used, in stand-alone mode\nand in combination with the angular distribution,\nA = Nvert /Nhor . Both of them are independent\nof the neutrino absolute flux.
