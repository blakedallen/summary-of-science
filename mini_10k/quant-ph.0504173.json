In these quantum algorithms, one can use\nany arbitrarily mixed state as the auxiliary qubits, and furthermore can recover the state of the\nauxiliary qubits to the original one after completing the computations. Since the recovered state\ncan be employed in any other computations, we obtain that a single preparation of the auxiliary\nqubits in an arbitrarily mixed state is sufficient to implement the iterative procedure in the Simon\nalgorithm or the period-finding algorithm.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 03.65.Ta\n\nQuantum computational algorithms can be executed\nin parallel on superpositions of exponentially many input\nstates, and their outcomes can be properly measured by\nvirtue of quantum interference. These enable exponential\nspeedups in the solutions of certain problems, and allow\none to distinguish between the quantum computational\ncomplexity classes and the classical ones [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\n7, 8, 9, 10].\nIt is assumed that most quantum algorithms require\nsome initialization at start-up, which is to prepare a certain pure state as an initial state. However, in experimentally realizable proposals for the implementation of\nquantum algorithms, it may be technically difficult to\nprepare the initial pure state. Especially, the nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) system is typically applied\nto physical systems in equilibrium at room temperature.\nThis means that the initial state of the spins is nearly\ncompletely random, that is, it is difficult to prepare pure\nquantum states of nuclear spins in NMR systems. Hence,\nit would be interesting whether quantum algorithms can\nbe efficiently performed even though the initial states or\nsome parts of them are not in a specific pure state. If it\nwould be possible, then the technical difficulty could be\nsettled to a certain extent, and furthermore if the parts of\nthe initial state would remain intact even after the computation, then the parts could be reused in any other\ncomputations. We call such a quantum algorithm the\ninitialization-free quantum algorithm when any quantum\nstate can be used as the auxiliary (target) qubits involved\nin the functional evaluation |xi \u2297 |yi 7\u2192 |xi \u2297 |y + f (x)i\nfor a given function f , and it can be recovered after the\ncomputation.\nIn the initialization-free quantum algorithms, which\nare implemented without initializing and deforming the\nstate of the auxiliary qubits, any qubits (which might\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: dpchi@math.snu.ac.kr\naddress: freddie1@snu.ac.kr\n\u2021 Electronic address: level@khu.ac.kr\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ncontain some other useful information) can be temporarily used as the auxiliary qubits, and the initial state of\nthe auxiliary qubits can be recovered at the end of the\ncomputation. Thus we can compose the auxiliary qubits\nof any qubits regardless of whether they are entangled\nwith others or being used in another computational process. Furthermore, in the case of iterative algorithms, in\nwhich one needs to perform the algorithm several times\nto solve given problems, the initialization-free quantum\nalgorithms can be implemented with the same auxiliary\nqubits repeatedly, while the original iterative algorithms\nrequire the initial auxiliary qubits of a certain pure state\nat each repetition.\nThere have been a few research works related to\nthe initialization-free quantum algorithms. Biham et\nal. [11, 12] have generalized Grover's algorithm [6] by allowing for an arbitrary initial amplitude distribution, and\nhave shown that Grover's algorithm (or, a large class of\nGrover-type algorithms) is robust against modest noise in\nthe amplitude initialization procedure. Parker and Plenio [13] found that one pure qubit and an initial supply of\nlog2 N qubits in an arbitrarily mixed state are sufficient\nto implement Shor's quantum factoring algorithm [5] efficiently, where the idea of using one pure qubit and other\nmixed qubits as the initial state was first introduced by\nKnill and Laflamme [14]. Their result implies that the\ncontrolled unitary transformations in Shor's algorithm\ncan be implemented without any initialization of the auxiliary qubits, while the auxiliary qubits cannot be left in\nthe initial state. Subsequently, Chi et al. [15] have presented a quantum algorithm to implement an oracle computing |xi 7\u2192 e2\u03c0if (x)/M |xi for f : ZN \u2192 ZM by making\nuse of an oracle of the form |xi \u2297 |yi 7\u2192 |xi \u2297 |y + f (x)i\nwithout setting the auxiliary qubits to a definite state before the computation, and have shown that generalized\nDeutsch-Jozsa algorithms can be implemented without\nany initialization of the auxiliary qubits when an oracle\ncomputing Uf : |xi \u2297 |yi 7\u2192 |xi \u2297 |y + f (x)i is employed.\nIn this Letter, we deal with two problems, the Simon problem [4] and the period-finding problem [5],\nwhich can be solved efficiently by the quantum com-\n\n\f2\nputer, and present the initialization-free quantum algorithms for these problems. Since most of known \"exponentially fast\" applications of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can be considered as a generalization of finding unknown period of a periodic function, the existence\nof these quantum algorithms implies that any initialization of the auxiliary qubits may be unnecessary in many\nquantum algorithms.\nWe first recall the Simon problem [4] that can be solved\nin polynomial time on a quantum computer but that requires exponential time on any classical bounded-error\nprobabilistic Turing machine if the data is supplied as\na black box, and we then investigate initialization-free\ntechniques for the Simon problem. We note that there\nexists an exact quantum polynomial-time algorithm for\nthe Simon problem [9]. However, we here deal with the\noriginal Simon algorithm which is polynomial-time in the\nexpected sense.\nFor convenience, we use the following notations. Let\nG = (Zn2 , \u2295n ) be a group under the binary operation \u2295n ,\nwhich is the bitwise XOR operation. For a subset A of\nG, let |A| denote the cardinality of A.\nWe define a bilinear map G \u00d7 G \u2192 Z2 by\nx * y = x0 y0 \u2295 x1 y1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 xn\u22121 yn\u22121\n\nUf . (iv) Apply Wn \u2297 I. Then the resulting state is\n|\u03a6i =\n\ny\u2208H\n\n(3)\n\nx\u0304\u2208G/H\n\nWe measure the first n-qubit state. Then for each\ny \u2208 H \u22a5 , the probability with which we obtain y as the\noutcome is\nh\u03a6| (|yi hy| \u2297 I) |\u03a6i =\n\nX\n2\n4\n1=\n.\n2\n|G|\n|G|\n\n(4)\n\nx\u0304\u2208G/H\n\nThus, after expected O(n) repetitions of this procedure,\nat least n linearly independent values of y can be collected\nso that the nontrivial h\u2217 is uniquely determined by solving the linear system of equations h\u2217 * y = 0. Then we\nhave h\u2217 = h as required.\nNow we present the initialization-free quantum algorithm for the Simon problem. We first consider the following quantum algorithm: (i) Prepare an n-qubit state\nin the state |0n i as the control qubits P\nand an n-qubit\nstate in an arbitrary pure state |\u03a8i = k \u03b1k |ki as the\nauxiliary qubits. (ii) Apply Wn \u2297 I. (iii) Apply Uf\u2295 ,\nwhere Uf\u2295 : |xi \u2297 |yi 7\u2192 |xi \u2297 |y \u2295n f (x)i. (iv) Choose a\nrandom n-bit string w = (w0 , w1 , * * * , wn\u22121 ) and apply\nw\nSw = \u03c3zw0 \u2297 \u03c3zw1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3z n\u22121 on the n-qubit auxiliary\nqubits, that is, apply I \u2297 Sw . (v) Apply Uf\u2295 . (vi) Apply\nI \u2297 Sw . (vii) Apply Wn \u2297 I. Then the resulting state\nbecomes\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2 X \uf8ed X\n(\u22121)w*f (x) (\u22121)x*y \uf8f8 |yi \u2297 |\u03a8i. (5)\n|G|\n\u22a5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x = (x0 , x1 , * * * , xn\u22121 ) and y = (y0 , y1 , * * * , yn\u22121 )\nare elements in G for xj , yj \u2208 Z2 , and \u2295 is the XOR\noperation, which is the addition modulo 2. This bilinear\nmap clearly satisfies the property that (x \u2295n y) * z =\nx * z \u2295 y * z for x, y and z in G.\nFor a subgroup H of G, let\nH \u22a5 = {x \u2208 G : x * y = 0 for all y \u2208 H}\n\n2 X X\n(\u22121)x*y |yi \u2297 |f (x)i .\n|G|\n\u22a5\n\n(2)\n\ny\u2208H\n\ndenote the orthogonal subgroup of H. We remark that\nthe quotient group G/H is well-defined since G is an\nabelian group.\nLet f : G \u2192 G be an arbitrary two-to-one map such\nthat f (x) = f (y) if and only if x \u2295n y \u2208 H where H =\n{0, h} is a subgroup of G for some nonzero h \u2208 G. Then\nthe Simon problem is to find the subgroup H, that is, to\ndetermine the value of h. The original Simon algorithm\nis as follows: (i) Prepare |0n i \u2297 |0n i. (ii) Apply Wn \u2297\nI, where Wn is the n-qubit\nWalsh-Hadamard transform\np\nP\ndefined as |xi 7\u2192 (1/ |G|) y\u2208G (\u22121)x*y |yi. (iii) Apply\n\nx\u0304\u2208G/H\n\nWe now measure the first n-qubit state.

Thus, for each y \u2208 H \u22a5 , the\nexpected probability (7) becomes 2/|G|.\nPFor any auxiliary qubitsn ofn the state \u03c1B =\nk pk |\u03a8k ih\u03a8k |, we let \u03c1 = |0 ih0 | \u2297 \u03c1B .

Furthermore, when y is obtained\nas the measurement outcome, the resulting state after\nthe measurement becomes |yihy| \u2297 \u03c1B . Therefore, this\ninitialization-free quantum algorithm can efficiently solve\nthe Simon problem.\nSimilarly, we can present the initialization-free quantum algorithm for the period-finding problem. We first\nreview the original quantum algorithm for the periodfinding problem, and then present the initialization-free\nperiod-finding algorithm, which can be considered as a\ngeneralization of the initialization-free Simon algorithm.\nLet f : Z2n \u2192 Z2m be a periodic function with\nan unknown period T , that is, f (x) = f (x + kT ) for\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 \u230a2n /T \u230b (or, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 \u230a2n /T \u230b + 1). Then\nthe period-finding problem is to find T . Classically, this\nproblem is known to be hard in the sense that no classical algorithms which can find T in polynomial time\nhave been found. However, there exists a polynomialtime quantum algorithm for the period finding [5], which\nis as follows: Let N = 2n . (i) Prepare |0n i \u2297 |0m i. (ii)\nApply F \u2297I,\u221awhere F is the N -dimensional QFT defined\nPN \u22121\nas |xi 7\u2192 (1/ N ) y=0 e2\u03c0ixy/N |yi. (iii) Apply Uf . (iv)\nApply F \u2297 I. Then the resulting state becomes\nN \u22121 T \u22121 Ax \u22121\n1 XX X\ne2\u03c0iy(x+jT )/N |yi \u2297 |f (x)i\nN y=0 x=0 j=0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Ax = \u230aN/T \u230b or \u230aN/T \u230b + 1. Now we measure the\nfirst n-qubit state, and then the probability of obtaining\ny as a measurement outcome is\nT \u22121 Ax\n1 X X\ne2\u03c0iyjT /N\nP (y) = 2\nN x=0 j=0\n\n2\n\n.\n\nT\nT\n\u2264 yT (mod N ) \u2264 ,\n2\n2\n\n4 1\n.\n\u03c02 T\n\n(13)\n\nThus, with probability at least 4/\u03c0 2 , the measured value\nof y satisfies the inequalities (12), that is, y satisfies the\nfollowing inequalities:\n\nor equivalently\n\nwith k randomly chosen in {0, 1, * * * , T \u2212 1} depending\non the measurement outcome. Therefore, for sufficiently\nsmall T with respect to N , the value k/T can be efficiently extracted from the measured y/N by the continued fraction method. Since k and T may be relatively\nprime with high probability, we can get the period T in\npolynomial time with respect to log N .\nThe initialization-free quantum algorithm for the\nperiod-finding problem can be presented by the procedure similar to the initialization-fee Simon algorithm. Inw\nstead of Sw = \u03c3zw0 \u2297 \u03c3zw1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3z n\u22121 for a randomly\nchosen n-bit string w in (5), we employ an m-qubit unitary operation Uw for a randomly chosen m-bit string w\ndefined as |yi 7\u2192 e2\u03c0iwy/M |\u2212yi, where M = 2m . We proceed with the following quantum algorithm: (i) Prepare\nn\nan n-qubit state in the state |0P\ni and an m-qubit state in\nan arbitrary pure state |\u03a8i = k \u03b1k |ki. (ii) Apply F \u2297I.\n(iii) Apply Uf . (iv) Choose a random m-bit string w and\napply Uw on the m-qubit state of the auxiliary qubits,\nthat is, apply I \u2297 Uw . (v) Apply Uf . (vi) Apply I \u2297 Uw .\n(vii) Apply F \u2297 I. Then the resulting state becomes\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nN\n\u22121 T\n\u22121 AX\nx \u22121\nX\nX\n1\n\uf8ed\ne2\u03c0iy(x+jT )/N e2\u03c0iwf (x)/M \uf8f8 |yi \u2297 |\u03a8i.\nN y=0 x=0 j=0\n\n(16)\n\nHence, the probability with which we can get |yi as a\nmeasurement outcome of the first n-qubit state is\nT \u22121 Ax \u22121\n1 X X\ne2\u03c0iy(x+jT )/N e2\u03c0iwf (x)/M\nPw (y) =\nN 2 x=0 j=0\n\n(11)\n\nWe note that there are precisely T values of y in\n{0, 1, * * * , N \u2212 1} satisfying\n\u2212\n\nP(y) \u2265\n\n(12)\n\n2\n\n.\n(17)\n\nBy straightforward calculations, we can get the expected\nprobability of obtaining y for randomly chosen w,\nM\u22121\nT \u22121 Ax\n1 X\n1 X X\ne2\u03c0iyjT /N\nPw (y) =\nM w=0\nN 2 x=0 j=0\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\n\f4\nAs in the initialization-free\nSimon algorithm, for any\nP\nm-qubit state \u03c1B = k pk |\u03a8k ih\u03a8k |, we let \u03c1 = |0n ih0n |\u2297\n\u03c1B , and let the superoperator \u039b be defined as\nM\u22121\n1 X\n\u039bw \u03c1\u039b\u2020w\n\u03c1 7\u2192\nM w=0\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u039bw = (F \u2297 I)(I \u2297 Uw )Uf (I \u2297 Uw )Uf (F \u2297 I). Then\nthe superoperator \u039b can perform the period-finding algorithm efficiently without any initialization on the auxiliary qubits, since the probability of obtaining |yi satisfying (12) is\nT \u22121 Ax\n1 X X\ne2\u03c0iyjT /N\ntr [(|yihy| \u2297 I)\u039b(\u03c1)] = 2\nN x=0 j=0\n\n2\n\n, (20)\n\nwhich is the same probability as that of the original\nperiod-finding algorithm in (11). Furthermore, as in the\ninitialization-free Simon algorithm, the resulting state\nafter the measurement becomes |yihy| \u2297 \u03c1B when y\nis the measurement outcome. Therefore, there exists\nan initialization-free quantum algorithm which can efficiently solve the period-finding problem.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the initializationfree quantum algorithms, which do not require any initialization of the auxiliary qubits involved in the process\n\n[1] D.

We have considered quantum algorithms for the\nSimon problem and the period-finding problem, and have\npresented the initialization-free quantum algorithms for\nthe problems, which are as efficient as the original ones.\nThe iterative algorithms such as the Simon algorithm\nand the period-finding algorithm demand the storage of\nauxiliary qubits and the extra operations to initialize the\nstate of the auxiliary qubits, whenever the procedure repeats. However if one utilizes our initialization-free technique then the size of the storage can be reduced and the\nextra operations can be omitted, since the same auxiliary\nqubits can repeatedly be used in our algorithms. Furthermore, since most known applications of the QFT can be\nconsidered as a generalization of finding unknown period\nof a periodic function (for example, Shor's factoring algorithm [5] and Hallgren's more recent algorithm for solving Pell's equation [10]), the initialization-free technique\ncould be applied to a lot of implementations of quantum\nalgorithms.\nThe authors would like to thank D.
