Skew density matrices can be diagonalized to yield probability interpretation. The power-counting prediction of perturbative QCD is found consistent with\nrecent CEBAF data on F2 (Q2 )/F1 (Q2 ).\n\nPerturbative QCD can be applied to hard exclusive processes in many ways. Use\nof \"skew\" or \"off-diagonal\" parton distributions [1] has generated attention. Skew\ndistributions are matrix elements sharing features with density matrices. The diagonal elements of a positive density matrix are interpreted as probabilities. Density\nmatrices depend on the basis: probability in one frame will appear to be an interference of amplitudes in another frame. This occurs with quark spin amplitudes\n[2], where transverse polarization (\"transversity\") distributions appear as interference in the helicity basis, and helicity distributions appear as interference in the\ntransverse polarization basis.\nHere we find a probabilistic interpretation for skew distributions involved in the\nproton electromagnetic form factors. Then a simple, kinematic angular momentum\nargument resolve a recent puzzle from data for the electromagnetic form factors\nF1 (Q2 ), F2 (Q2 ). For about 30 years it was thought that F2 (Q2 )/F1 (Q2 ) \u223c 1/Q2\nwas a prediction of hard scattering, and in particular, of pQCD. We made the same\nprediction on the basis q\nof skew distributions in 1993 [3]. Recent CEBAF data [4]\nshows that F2 /F1 \u223c 1/ |Q2 |. Our prediction missed some instructive points, and\nthe CEBAF result is expected, if proper kinematics is simply taken into account.\nDiagonalization: Consider 2 \u2192 2 quark-proton scattering with momentum transfer \u2206\u03bc , \u22062 < 0. The proton is described by states |p \u2212 \u2206/2, s > coming \"in\" and\n|p + \u2206/2, s\u2032 > going \"out\". The scattering matrix element is\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a6s,s\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (p; k, k , \u2206)\u03b4(k + p \u2212 k \u2212 p \u2212 \u2206)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd4 zd4 z \u2032 exp(\u2212ikz + ik \u2032 z \u2032 ) < p \u2212 \u2206/2, s|\u03c8\u03b2 (z)\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 (z \u2032 )|p + \u2206/2, s\u2032 > .\n\n\fHere \u03b1, \u03b2 are Dirac indices of the quark fields \u03c8, and the in- and out-quarks have\nmomenta k, k \u2032 with k = x(p \u2212 \u2206/2) + ~kT , k \u2032 = x\u2032 (p + \u2206/2) + ~kT\u2032 . A time-ordering\nsymbol is dropped, as only one time ordering contributes: see Diehl and Gousset [1]\nNow \u03a6(\u2206) can be decomposed into terms symmetric and antisymmetric in \u2206; the\nsymmetric part is Hermitian. This leads to a density matrix we can diagonalize.\nTo diagonalize we make a series of coordinate transformations. Make a Lorentz\ntransformation to the frame: p = (p+ , 0, m2/2p+ ); \u2206 = (0, \u2206T , \u2212t/2p+ ); \u22062T =\n\u2212t. Now \u2206\u03bc becomes entirely transverse as p+ \u2192 \u221e. The partons have 4-vectors\nk \u03bc = xp\u03bc + kT\u03bc , x(p + \u2206)\u03bd + kT\u2032\u03bd , yielding\nx = x\u2032 ; kT\u2032 = kT + \u2206T (1 \u2212 x).\nThe matrix element is now diagonal in x. This might seem impossible, because\nthe x, x\u2032 dependence of skew distributions is thought to be invariant: but x is\nnot Lorentz-invariant sideways. The convolution in ~kT is diagonalized by conjugate\nR\n~ ~\ntransverse spatial coordinates ~b. Then d2 b \u03a6(s, s\u2032 ; ~b/(1\u2212x), x)eib*\u2206 can be inverted\nby Fourier transform to find the integrand, diagonal in everything but spin, which\nalso can be made diagonal by familiar helicity or transverse bases.\nThe choice of frames and diagonalization was used in an independent early introduction of off-diagonal distributions [3]. Due to a kinematics goof we missed the\nfactor 1/(1 \u2212 x). A review by Brodsky and Lepage [5] was useful.\nInterpretation: The electromagnetic form factors (with \u2212Q2 = \u22062T ) are found by\nfollowing the Feynman rules, which includes\nmultiplication by the quark charge eq ,\nR\ntracing \u03a6 with \u03b3 \u03bc , and doing the integral dx d2 b. At large \u2212Q2 this is dominated\nby b2 \u223c 1/|Q2 | by Fourier analysis. The \"short distance\" implied by large Q\nis far more general than the more problematic \"quark-counting\" argument. We\nsimply have one quark located by the hard momentum Q, while the asymptotic\nshort distance theory [5] assumes that all possible Fock states are separated by\nasymptotically short distance. We remain within the framework of pQCD, of\ncourse, while choosing a more general factorization method.\nSince the form factor F1 (Q2 ) is known from data, we invert the Fourier transform\nto solve for a positive-definite diagonal element of the density matrix, namely a\nprobability:\nP (\u03bb, \u03bb; ~b) =\n\n1\ne2q\n\nZ\n\n~ ~\n\nd2 QT e\u2212ib*QT F1 (Q2 ).\n\n(1)\n\nPositivity is assured because F1 (Q2 ) is monotonically decreasing. The quantity\nP (\u03bb, \u03bb; ~b) is on a similar footing to the usual parton distributions. Indeed, the usual\nparton distributions are functions of x integrated over kT , while P (b) depends on\nb = |~b| and has been integrated over x.\nA fit to the Fourier transform of F1 (Q2 ) has been performed. A profile of the\ntransverse (1/(1 \u2212 x)-weighted) probability to find a quark (mostly of the up-type)\nwas shown at the meeting. We expect that this invariant quantity will be useful in\nmany studies involving the transverse coordinate.\n\n\fOrbital Angular Momentum: Quark orbital angular momentum is a fascinating\nsubject of great interest in the proton spin puzzle. In the case at hand, we are lucky\nto have two quarks evaluated at the same x, ~b points, so that difficulties of gauge\ninvariance are minimal. Indeed, P (b) is gauge invariant by definition in terms of\nobservable quantities.\nWe expand the operators in terms of solutions to \u22072 \u03c8 = 0. By usual methods\n[2] the operators are evaluated inside the proton state, letting the correlation \u03a6 be\nexpressed by c-number \"wave functions\". Partons are below threshold in a form\nfactor, so we need an expansion for orbital angular momentum for spacelike k:\n\u03c8(z \u2212 , ~b, z + = 0) =\n\nXZ\n\ndx \u03c8n (x)In (b)e\u2212in\u03c6 eixp\n\n+z\u2212\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nn\n\nHere e\u2212in\u03c6 are light-cone SO(2) orbital angular momentum basis functions; In (b)\nare modified Bessel functions more usually seen as Jn (b) for a timelike basis. 1 We\nare interested in the F2 form factor, associated with i\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd Q\u03bd /2m, which represents\nproton helicity-flip at large Q2 . Since we cannot change the helicity of a quark with\na hard scattering (the near-perfect chiral symmetry of pQCD), the proton can only\nflip its spin to make F2 by transferring a unit of orbital angular momentum in the\nquark [3]. (Hoodbhoy and Ji [6] subsequently verified the same result.)\nNote we are not attempting here to derive the functional dependence of P (\u03bb, \u03bb; ~b):\nin our approach this comes from data. Our approach is to relate each power of b\nor angular momentum to further suppression by powers of 1/Q. The argument\nfor short distance is kinematically compelling here (if controversial in the quarkcounting method), so for large Q the Fourier transform is dominated by I0 (b) \u223c b0\nif this channel is allowed. But I0 (b) represents the s-wave component, with zero\nangular momentum, and so this channel is open only to the helicity non-flip, namely\nF1 \u223c \u03b4\u03bb\u03bb\u2032\n\nZ\n\n~ T * ~b).\ndx d2 b \u03c8\u03040 (x)\u0393\u03c80 (x) [I0 (b/(1 \u2212 x))]2 exp(iQ\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u0393 represents the necessary Dirac matrices.\nConversely, the only possibility for the helicity-flip F2 is to use powers of b to\nconserve the angular momentum, and suffer the corresponding power-suppression\nin Q. On the basis of this power counting, it was reasoned [3] that by angular\nmomentum selection rules, the integrals over b would vanish unless two representations of the same angular momentum matched up, giving the previous prediction\nF2 (Q2 )/F1 (Q2 ) \u223c 1/Q2 for Q2 > GeV 2 . Now consulting the formulas this is simply\n~ ~\nnot true. There is a factor of eiQT *bT carrying angular momentum:\nF2 \u223c \u03b4\u03bb,\u2212\u03bb\u2032\n\nZ\n\ndx d2 b \u03c8\u03040 (x)\u0393\u03c81 (x)I0 (b/(1 \u2212 x)) I1 (b/(1 \u2212 x)) ei|QT |b cos(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6Q ) ei\u03c6 + cc.\n(4)\n\n1)\n\nIf one is concerned about b \u2192 \u221e, then Green functions can be expanded in series of\nIn (b< )Kn (b> ) where b< (b> ) is the smaller (larger) of two b arguments. We only need short\ndistance.\n\n\f~ breaks the rotational symmetry of the problem.\nPhysically, the probe Q\nWe reiterate that this analysis is entirely within the context of pQCD. In pQCD\none takes some matrix elements from the data, and makes predictions for others.\nWhat can we predict here? From the power-counting cited, we have\n< \u03c8\u03041 (x)\u03c80 (x) >\nF2 (Q2 )\n,\n=q\n2\nF1 (Q )\n|Q2 | < b\u03c8\u03040 (x)\u03c80 (x) >\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the braces represent the integrals. The fact that (Q/GeV )F2 (Q2 )/F1 (Q2 ) is\nnot far from unity in the CEBAF data indicates that the proton wave functions for\nquark angular momenta 1 and 0 are not too different in magnitude. Constituent\nquark, or non-relativistic models are ruled out, but those models were never capable of capturing the Fock space description of the skew distribution. It will be\ninteresting to continue these studies in the context of the larger proton spin puzzle.\nAcknowledgments:\n98ER41079.\n\nWork supported by DOE grant number DE-FGO2-\n\nREFERENCES\n1. J.
