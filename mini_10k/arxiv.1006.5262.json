Let G be a finitely generated group with b1 (G) = 1. Then there are at most\nfinitely many distinct knot complements M such that there is an epimorphism \u03c6 : G \u0589\n\u03c01 (M).\nDate: July 6, 2010.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57M.\nAgol and Liu partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0806027.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nAs a corollary, we resolve Problem 1.12(D) from Kirby's problem list [11], conjectured\nby Jonathan K. Simon in the 1970's. Recall a knot group is the fundamental group of the\ncomplement of a knot in S 3 .\nCorollary 1.2. Every knot group maps onto at most finitely many knot groups.\nNote that this also resolves Problem 1.12(C). Our techniques say nothing about Part\n(B), and Part (A) is known to be false.\nThere has been a fair amount of work recently on Simon's conjecture, which partly motivated our work. Daniel S. Silver and Wilbur Whitten proved that a fibered knot group\nmaps onto at most finitely many knot groups ([24, the comment after Conjecture 3.9],\nsee also [14]). Silver and Whitten also considered a restricted partial order on knot complements where the epimorphism must preserve peripheral structure, and therefore has a\nwell-defined degree, ([23, 22]). Restricting the class of epimorphisms to ones of non-zero\ndegree, finiteness was shown by Michel Boileau, Hyam Rubinstein and Shicheng Wang\n[2]. Recently it was proven that a 2-bridge knot group maps onto at most finitely many\nknot groups by Boileau et al. [1]. There was also some experimental evidence for epimorphsims between prime knot groups of \u2264 11 crossings by Teruaki Kitano, Masaaki\nSuzuki, et al. ([9, 12]). There are also families of examples of epimorphisms between\n2-bridge knot groups, cf. [17, 13, 10].\nNow we give some remarks on the proof of Theorem 1.1. The finitely generated case is\nreduced to the finitely presented case following a suggestion of Jack Button, so we assume\nthat G is finitely presented. Given the proof of Simon's conjecture for maps of non-zero\ndegree [2], we need to allow maps of zero degree. In this case, and allowing finitely presented groups G with b1 (G) = 1, techniques such as simplicial volume give no information.\nNevertheless, we can show that there is a bound on the simplicial volume of the image in\nterms of the presentation length of G, defined by Daryl Cooper in [7] and used to bound the\nvolume of a hyperbolic manifold (Section 4). The presentation length gives a coarse substitute for simplicial volume. Suppose we want to prove Theorem 1.1 for epimorphisms to\nhyperbolic knot groups. Then bounding the volume does not give a finiteness result, since\nthere can be infinitely many hyperbolic knot complements of bounded volume, such as the\ntwist knots, which are obtained by Dehn filling on the Whitehead link. A twist knot k with\na large number of twists will have a very short geodesic in the hyperbolic metric on its\ncomplement, which contains a very large tubular neighborhood by the Margulis Lemma.\nWhat we would like to do is to factor the epimorphism G \u0589 Gk through the fundamental\ngroup of the Whitehead link complement obtained by drilling the short geodesic from the\ntwist knot complement. Intuitively, we expect that a presentation complex for G mapped\ninto S 3 \u2212 k should be possible to homotope off of a deep Margulis tube, since the complex\nshould have bounded area, whereas the meridian disk of the Margulis tube should have\nlarge area. If we could do this, then we obtain a contradiction, since the only finitely generated covers of the Whithead link complement with b1 = 1 are elementary covers, and\nthe homomorphism factoring through such a cover could not map onto Gk . However, this\nfactorization cannot be done in general, cf. Example 2.2. The substitute for this is to factor\nthrough the extended drilling, which has enough good properties, such as coherence of the\nfundamental group (cf. Subsection 2.3), that we may still obtain a contradiction (Section\n3). The general case of non-hyperbolic knots is similar, but requires some modifications\ninvolving the JSJ decomposition of the knot complement and some case-by-case analysis\n(Sections 5, 6, 7.2, 8). The technique for this factorization is based on a result of Matthew\nE. White ([28]), which bounds the diameter of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold in terms of\nthe length of the presentation of its fundamental group. We improve upon White's result\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n3\n\nin Section 9 (to understand the improvement of White's result Theorem 9.1(2), you need\nonly read Section 2.2 and Section 3.2 ).\nAcknowledgement: We thank Daniel Groves for helpful conversations. We thank Jack\nButton, Hongbin Sun, and Shicheng Wang for comments on a preliminary draft, and the\nreferee for their comments.\n2. Dehn extensions\nIn this section and the next, we study factorizations of maps through extended Dehn\nfillings. This is motivated by the na\u0131\u0308ve question: suppose fn : K \u2192 Mn is a sequence of\nmaps from a finite 2-complex to orientable aspherical compact 3-manifolds Mn , which are\nobtained by Dehn filling on a 3-manifold N along a sequence of slopes on a torus boundary\ncomponent of N, does fn factorize as in \u25e6 f \u2032 up to homotopy for some f \u2032 : K \u2192 N for\ninfinitely many n, where in : N \u2192 Mn is the Dehn filling inclusion? The answer is negative\nas it stands, (cf. Subsection 2.1), but a modified version will be true in certain natural\nsituations if we allow 'extended Dehn fillings' (cf. Theorems 3.2, 3.6). We introduce and\nstudy Dehn extensions in Subsections 2.2, 2.3.\n2.1. Examples. We start with an elementary example. The phenomenon here essentially\nillustrates why we should expect the factorization only through the extended Dehn filling,\nand will be used in the construction of Dehn extensions.\nExample 2.1. Let P = Z\u03b1 \u2295 Z\u03b2 be a rank-2 free-abelian group generated by \u03b1, \u03b2. We\nidentify P as the integral lattice of R2 , where \u03b1 = (1, 0), \u03b2 = (0, 1). Let \u03c9 = a \u03b1 + b \u03b2 \u2208 P\nbe primitive and m > 1 be an integer. Define an extended lattice of R2 by P\u0303 = P + Z m\u03c9 .\nPick any primitive \u03b6 \u2208 P such that \u03c9 + \u03b6 \u2208 mZ \u2295 mZ. There are infinitely many such \u03b6's, for\nexample, \u03b6 = (my \u2212 a) \u03b1 + (\u2212mx \u2212 b) \u03b2 with integers pairs (x, y) such that ax + by = 1. Note\nthere are infinitely many such pairs since the general solution to the linear Diophantine\nequation ax + by = 1 is (x, y) = (x\u2217 + bt, y\u2217 \u2212 at), where t \u2208 Z and (x\u2217 , y\u2217 ) is a particular\nsolution. \u03b6 is primitive because (\u2212x)(my \u2212 a) + (\u2212y)(\u2212mx \u2212 b) = 1. Thus there is a welldefined epimorphism,\n\u03c6\u03b6 : P\u0303 \u2192 P / Z\u03b6,\nby requiring \u03c6\u03b6 |P to be modulo Z\u03b6, and \u03c6\u03b6 ( m\u03c9 ) =\n\n\u03c9+\u03b6\nm\n\n+ Z\u03b6.\n\nWe extend this construction to give a counterexample to the question in the category of\n3-manifolds.\nExample 2.2. Let k p/q be the p/q-cable knot (p, q coprime and q > 1) on a hyperbolic knot\nk \u2282 S 3 . Let N = S 3 \u2212 k p/q , M = S 3 \u2212 k. Identify P = \u03c01 (\u2202M) = Z\u03bc \u2295 Z\u03bb as a peripheral\nsubgroup of \u03c01 (M),\n= \u03bc p \u03bbq , then\n\u221aq where \u03bc, \u03bb are the meridian and the longitude. Let w\nq\n\u03c01 (N) \u001b \u03c01 (M)h wi, by which we mean the group\n\u221a \u03c01 (M) \u2217 hui modulo u = w. We may\nas well write \u03c01 (N) \u001b \u03c01 (M) \u2217P Q, where Q = Ph q wi. Note the abelianization of Q equals\nP\u0303 = P+Z \u03c9q , where \u03c9 = p \u03bc+q \u03bb, if we identify P = Z\u03bc\u2295Z\u03bb as the integral lattice of Q\u2295Q.\nBy Example 2.1, there are infinitely many primitive \u03b6's such that \u03c9 + \u03b6 \u2208 qZ \u2295 qZ, and\nthere are epimorphisms \u03c6\u0304| : P\u0303 \u2192 P / Z\u03b6, which extend as \u03c6\u0304 : \u03c01 (M) \u2217P P\u0303 \u2192 \u03c01 (M\u03b6 ) in an\nobvious fashion, where M\u03b6 is the Dehn filling along \u03b6 \u2208 P. Hence we obtain epimorphisms\n\u03c6 : \u03c01 (N) \u2192 \u03c01 (M\u03b6 ) via the composition:\n\u03c01 (N) \u001b \u03c01 (M) \u2217P Q \u2192 \u03c01 (M) \u2217P P\u0303 \u2192 \u03c01 (M\u03b6 ).\n\n\f4\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nNow there are infinitely many slopes \u03b6 \u2282 \u2202M, such that the corresponding \u03c6 : \u03c01 (N) \u2192\n\u03c01 (M\u03b6 ) are all surjective. It also is clear that \u03c6 can be realized by a map\nf : N \u2192 M\u03b6 ,\nby mapping the companion piece of N to M\u03b6 , and extending over the cable pattern piece\nof N.\nHowever, f does not always factor through the Dehn filling i : M \u2192 M\u03b6 up to homotopy.\nSuppose f \u2243 i \u25e6 h for some h : N \u2192 M. Let \u03ba : M\u0303 \u2192 M be the covering corresponding\nto Im(h\u266f ), where h\u266f : \u03c01 (N) \u2192 \u03c01 (M) after choosing some base points. Let j : M \u2192 N\nbe the inclusion of M as the companion piece of N, and let \u03ba\u2032 : M\u0303 \u2032 \u2192 M\u0303 be the covering\ncorresponding to Im((h \u25e6 j)\u266f ). The homotopy lift h\u0303 : M \u2192 M\u0303 is hence \u03c01 -surjective, and\nthe homotopy lift hg\n\u25e6 j : M \u2192 M\u0303 \u2032 is also \u03c01 -surjective. We have the commutative diagram:\nj\n\nM \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ngj\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nh\u25e6\ny\n\u03ba\u2032\n\nN\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nh\u0303\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u03ba\n\nM\u0303 \u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M\u0303 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M.\n\nNote H1 (N) \u001b H1 (M) \u001b Z and M\u0303 and M\u0303 \u2032 are hyperbolic with non-elementary fundamental group, since they map \u03c01 -surjectively to M\u03b6 via the factorization. Clearly H1 ( M\u0303)\nand H1 ( M\u0303 \u2032 ) are isomorphic to Z. As we shall see in Theorem 4.1, the volume of M\u0303 is\nat most \u03c0l(\u03c01(N)), where l(\u03c01 (N)) is the presentation length of \u03c01 (N), and similarly the\nvolume of M\u0303 \u2032 is at most \u03c0l(\u03c01(M)). Thus M\u0303 is a finite covering of M of some degree\nd \u2264 \u03c0l(\u03c01 (M))/Vol(M). Moreover, h\u0303\u2217 : H1 (N) \u2192 H1 ( M\u0303) is an isomorphism as h\u0303 is \u03c01 surjective, and \u03ba\u2217 : H1 ( M\u0303) \u2192 H1 (M) is the multiplication by some factor d0 of d. Similarly,\n(hg\n\u25e6 j)\u2217 : H1 (M) \u2192 H1 ( M\u0303 \u2032 ) is an isomorphism, and \u03ba\u2217\u2032 : H1 ( M\u0303 \u2032 ) \u2192 H1 ( M\u0303) is multiplication by a factor q\u2032 , which is the same factor as the multiplication j\u2217 : H1 (M) \u2192 H1 (N). By\nthe cabling construction of knots, the image of j\u2217 : H1 (M) \u2192 H1 (N) \u001b Z is contained in\nqZ, and thus we see that q\u2032 = q. Thus:\n\u00d7q\n\nH1 (M) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1 (N)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u001b\uf8e6\n\u001b\uf8e6\ny\ny\n\u00d7q\n\n\u00d7d0\n\nH1 ( M\u0303 \u2032 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1 ( M\u0303) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1 (M).\n\nHowever, we have q = Vol( M\u0303 \u2032 ) / Vol( M\u0303) \u2264 \u03c0l(\u03c01 (M)) / Vol(M). Therefore if we take\nq > \u03c0l(\u03c01 (M)) / Vol(M), we obtain a contradiction. In other words, for such q's, f does\nnot factor through the Dehn filling i : M \u2192 M\u03b6 up to homotopy.\nOn the other hand, as evidence for Theorem 3.2, clearly every \u03c6 : \u03c01 (N) \u2192 \u03c01 (M\u03b6 ) as\nabove factors through the 'extended' Dehn filling epimorphisms \u03b9e : \u03c01 (M) \u2217P (P + Z q\u03b6 ) \u2192\n\u03c01 (M\u03b6 ), since P + Z q\u03b6 = P\u0303.\n\n2.2. Dehn extensions of filling and drilling. In this subsection, we introduce the notion\nof Dehn extensions.\nLet N be an aspherical orientable compact 3-manifold, and \u03b6 be a slope on an incompressible torus boundary component T \u2282 \u2202N. By choosing a base-point of N and a path to\nT , we may identify P = \u03c01 (T ) as a peripheral subgroup of \u03c01 (N). By choosing an orientation of \u03b6, we identify \u03b6 as primitive element in P. On the other hand, by choosing a basis\nfor \u03c01 (T ), we may also identify P \u001b Z \u2295 Z as the integral lattice in Q \u2295 Q.\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n5\n\nDefinition 2.3. For any integer m > 1, we define the Dehn extension of \u03c01 (N) along \u03b6 with\ndenominator m as the amalgamated product:\n\u0012\n\u03b6\u0013\n.\n\u03c01 (N)e(\u03b6,m) = \u03c01 (N) \u2217P P + Z\nm\nWe often simply abbreviate this \u03c01 (N)e when m and \u03b6 are clear from the context. There is\na natural extended Dehn filling epimorphism:\n\u03b9e : \u03c01 (N)e \u2192 \u03c01 (N\u03b6 ),\n\ndefined by quotienting out the normal closure of Z m\u03b6 , where N\u03b6 is the Dehn filling of N\nalong \u03b6. We also regard \u03c01 (N) as a trivial Dehn extension of itself with denominator m = 1,\nin which case we do not require N to have any incompressible torus boundary component\nor non-empty boundary.\nFrom a topological point of view, the Dehn extension \u03c01 (N)e may be regarded as the\nfundamental group of a topological space N e = N e(\u03b6,m) , which will be called the Dehn\nextension of N along \u03b6 with denominator m. Certainly N e could be N itself for the trivial\nDehn extension. If m > 1, N e is obtained from N by gluing T \u2282 \u2202N to the source torus of\na mapping cylinder, denoted as Z, of the m-fold covering map between tori:\n\u03b6\nR2 /P \u2192 R2 /(P + Z ).\nm\nTo visualize this, take the product of the unit interval I = [0, 1] with an m-pod (i.e. a cone\nover m points), identify the 0-slice with the 1-slice via a primitive cyclic permutation of\nthe legs, and denote the resulting space as \u03a8 = \u03a8(m). The 'side' of \u03a8 is a loop which is\nhomotopic to m wraps along of the 'ridge' loop of \u03a8. The mapping cylinder Z = Z(m) is\nhomeomorphic to S 1 \u00d7\u03a8, and we will refer the product of S 1 with the side loop (resp. ridge\nloop) as the side torus (resp. ridge torus). Glue the side torus of Z to the boundary T via a\nhomeomorphism, such that the side-loop of Z is identified with \u03b6, (clearly this determines\nthe resulting space up to homeomorphism), cf. Figure 1. We call Z the ridge piece, and the\ncopy of N under the inclusion the regular part.\nPSfrag replacements\nglue up with a\nrotation of\nT\n\n2\u03c0\nm\n\n\u03a8\nS1\nidentify \u2202's\n\nN\n\n\u03b6\n\n\u00d7\n\nthe side-loop\n\nZ\n\nFigure 1. The Dehn extension N e along \u03b6, illustrated with m = 3.\nThe Dehn extension N e may be ad hoc characterized as a 'ridged manifold'. Despite\nthe mild singularity near the ridges, N e behaves like an aspherical compact 3-manifold in\nmany ways. For instance, N e is an Eilenberg-MacLane space of \u03c01 (N)e , and H\u2217 (N e , Q) \u001b\nH\u2217 (N, Q). The Dehn extension N e also admits an analogous JSJ decomposition. Recall that\nthe classical Jaco-Shalen-Johanson (JSJ) decomposition says any orientable irreducible\n\n\f6\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\ncompact 3-manifold can be cut along a minimal finite collection of essential tori into\natoroidal and Seifert fibered pieces, canonical up to isotopy. The analogous JSJ decomposition of N e consists of the JSJ pieces of N together with a ridge piece Z if m > 1. These\npieces are glued along \u03c01 -injective tori. This is a graph-of-spaces decomposition, associating to N e a finite connected graph, called the JSJ graph, whose vertices correspond to the\nJSJ pieces and edges to the JSJ tori. Moreover, \u03c01 (N e ) = \u03c01 (N)e is coherent; indeed, any\ncovering of N e with finitely generated fundamental group has a Scott core, as we shall see\nin Subsection 2.3.\nThere is also a natural map, called the extended Dehn filling of N e along \u03b6,\nie : N e \u2192 M,\n\ndefined by collapsing Z \u001b S 1 \u00d7 \u03a8 to S 1 . ie induces \u03b9e : \u03c01 (N)e \u001b \u03c01 (N e ) \u2192 \u03c01 (N\u03b6 ).\nTo an essential drilling, we may naturally associate a Dehn extension. Specifically, let\nM be an aspherical orientable compact 3-manifold, and \u03b3 \u2282 M be an essential simple\nclosed curve, i.e. which is not null-homotopic. Then N = M \u2212 \u03b3 is an aspherical orientable\ncompact 3-manifold, and the boundary component \u2202\u03b3 N coming from the drilling is an\nincompressible torus.There is a canonical slope \u03b6 \u2282 \u2202\u03b3 N so that M = N\u03b6 . For any integer\nm > 0, we shall call the Dehn extension N e (\u03b6, m) the extended drilling of M along \u03b3 with\ndenominator m.\nWe shall be most interested in geometric drillings, namely, when \u03b3 is a simple closed\ngeodesic in the interior of some geometric piece of M. Factorization of maps through\nextended geometric drillings will be studied in Section 3.\n2.3. Coherence and the Scott core. With notation from Subsection 2.2, in this subsection, we show every Dehn extension N e is coherent, in the sense that every finitely generated subgroup of its fundamental group is finitely presented. This follows from the existence of a Scott core for any connected finite generated covering space \u00d1 e of N proved\nin Proposition 2.6 below. The results in this section are preparatory for the arguments in\nSection 7. Recall for a topological space X, a Scott core of X is a connected compact subspace C \u2282 \u00d1 e , if any, whose inclusion induces a \u03c01 -isomorphism. It is named after Peter\nScott who first found such cores for 3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group\n([20]) . First, we need an auxiliary result. For background on combinatorial group theory,\ncf. [6].\nLemma 2.4. Let G = A \u2217C B or G = A\u2217C be a free product with amalgamation or HNN\nextension. If G and C are finitely generated, then A and B are too.\nProof. We give the argument for the amalgamated product, the HNN case being similar.\nLet g1 , . . . , gn be generators for G, and c1 , . . . , cm be generators for C. We may write\neach element gi = ai,1 bi,1 * * * ai,k(i) bi,k(i) , where ai, j \u2208 A, bi, j \u2208 B, i = 1, . . . , n. Let A\u2032 =\nhai, j , cl i, B\u2032 = hai, j , cl i, so that C < A\u2032 , C < B\u2032 . Then we have G\u2032 = A\u2032 \u2217C B\u2032 \u2192 hA\u2032 , B\u2032i \u2264\nA \u2217C B = G injects by [6, Proposition 28]. But clearly also G \u2264 G\u2032 , so G = G\u2032 , A\u2032 = A, B\u2032 =\nB, and we see that A and B are finitely generated.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.5. If G is a finitely generated group which is a finite graph of groups with\nfinitely generated edge groups, then the vertex groups are also finitely generated.\nProof. Use Lemma 2.4 together with induction on the number of vertices of the graph of\ngroups.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.6. Let N be an orientable aspherical compact 3-manifold, and N e be the\nDehn extension of N with denominator m > 0 along some slope on an incompressible\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n7\n\ntorus boundary component. Then any connected covering space \u03ba : \u00d1 e \u2192 N e with finitely\ngenerated fundamental group has an aspherical Scott core C \u2282 \u00d1 e . Furthermore, for any\ncomponent of the preimage of a JSJ torus of N e , C either meets it in a Scott core of the\ncomponent or misses it. For any component of the preimage of a JSJ piece of N e , C either\nmeets it in an aspherical Scott core of the component or misses it.\nRemark. The construction here includes the case when N e is the trivial Dehn extension,\nand so will Lemmas 2.7 and 2.8.\nProof. Let \u03ba : \u00d1 e \u2192 N e be the covering map, and let T be the union of the JSJ tori of\nN e . Pick a finite bouquet of circles L = S 1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 S 1 mapping \u03c01 -surjectively into \u00d1 e , say\nf : L \u2192 \u00d1 e . There are only finitely many components of the preimage of JSJ tori meeting\nf (L), and there are only finitely many components of the preimage of pieces meeting f (L).\nLet T \u2282 T be a JSJ torus. For any component T\u0303 of \u03ba\u22121 (T ) meeting f (L), clearly T\u0303 is\neither a torus, or a cylinder, or a plane, so we may take the torus, or an essential annulus,\nor a disk in T\u0303 containing T\u0303 \u2229 f (L), respectively, and denote as CT\u0303 . Let CT be the union of\nCT\u0303 for all such T\u0303 's, and let CT be the union of all CT 's.\nFor a regular piece J, first observe any component J \u0303 of \u03ba\u22121 (J) has finitely generated\nfundamental group. To see this, we may assume J \u0303 meets f (L). Then there are at most\n \u0303 1 \u222a* * *\u222aUt \u2282\nfinitely many components of \u00d1 e \u2212 J \u0303 which meet f (L), say U1 , * * * , Ut , and J\u222aU\n \u0303 1\u222a\n\u00d1 e is \u03c01 -surjective as it contains f (L). Clearly it is also \u03c01 -injective, so \u03c01 (\u00d1 e ) \u001b \u03c01 ( J\u222aU\n* * * \u222a Ut ). Note J \u0303 and Ui 's are glued along \u03c01 -injective coverings of a JSJ torus, namely\nplanes, cylinders or tori, so we have a graph-of-groups decomposition of \u03c01 (\u00d1 e ), whose\n \u0303 \u03c01 (U1 ), * * * , \u03c01 (Ut ) and whose edge groups are finitely generated.\nvertex groups are \u03c01 ( J),\nBy Corollary 2.5, it follows the vertex groups must all be finitely generated as \u03c01 (\u00d1 e ) is\n \u0303 is finitely generated.\nfinitely generated. In particular, \u03c01 ( J)\nThus, as J \u0303 \u2229 CT \u2282 \u2202 J \u0303 is a (possibly empty) compact sub-manifold, by a theorem of\nDarryl McCullough [16, Theorem 2], there is a Scott core of J \u0303 which meets \u2202 J \u0303 exactly in\nJ \u0303 \u2229 CT . Moreover, since J \u0303 is aspherical, we may also make the core aspherical by adding\nto the core bounded complementary components whose inclusion into J \u0303 is \u03c01 -trivial. The\n \u0303\nresult is denoted as C J \u0303. Let C J be the union of all such J's.\nLet Z be the ridge piece of N e . For each component Z\u0303 of \u03ba\u22121 (Z) meeting f (L), the\npreimage of the ridge torus is either a torus, or a cylinder, or a plane, so we may take the\ntorus, or an essential annulus, or a disk in the image, respectively, and thicken it up to a\nregular neighborhood in Z\u0303 which meets the preimage of the side torus exactly in Z\u0303 \u2229 CT .\nThis is a Scott core CZ\u0303 of Z\u0303. Let CZ be the union of all such Z\u0303's.\nLet C be the union of all the C J 's and CZ constructed above. Then C is an aspherical\nScott core of \u00d1 e as required.\n\u0003\nIn this paper, we often refer to any connected union Q of a few components from CZ and\nC J 's as a chunk of C, following the notation in the proof of Proposition 2.6. It is a ridge\nchunk (resp. a hyperbolic chunk, or a Seifert fibered chunk) if it is a single component from\nCZ (resp. some C J where J is a hyperbolic piece, or a Seifert fibered piece). It is a regular\nchunk if it is contained in C \u2212 CZ . Note if the denominator of the Dehn extension N e is 2,\nthere could be some ridge chunk which is a manifold, homeomorphic to either I \u00d7 D2 , or\nS 1 \u00d7 A, or I \u00d7 A, or S 1 \u00d7 R, or I \u00d7 R, where A is an annulus and R is a M\u00f6bius strip, but we\ndo not regard such as a regular chunk. In particular, regular chunks are all orientable. The\ncut boundary \u2202T Q of a chunk Q is the union of the components of CT which are contained\nin the frontier of Q in \u00d1 e . For example, if Q is regular, \u2202T Q is a (possibly disconnected,\nwith boundary) essential compact subsurface of \u2202Q.\n\n\f8\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nThe preimage of the JSJ tori T of N e cuts C into minimal chunks along CT = C\u2229\u03ba\u22121 (T ).\nThis induces a graph-of-spaces decomposition of C over a finite connected simplical graph\n\u039b. The vertices of \u039b correspond to the components of C \u2212 CT , and whenever two components are adjacent to each other, there are edges joining them, each corresponding to a\ndistinct component of CT along which they are adjacent. Thus a chunk Q may be regarded\nas the subspace of C associated to a connected complete subgraph of \u039b. The graph-ofspaces decomposition also induces a graph-of-groups decomposition of \u03c01 (C) along free\nabelian edge groups of rank at most 2.\nIn the rest of this subsection, we discuss how to get rid of unnecessary chunks when\nb1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1.\nLemma 2.7. A chunk Q \u2282 C is contractible if and only if b1 (Q) = 0.\nProof. It suffices to prove the 'if' direction. This is clear if Q is a ridge chunk. Also, if\nQ a regular chunk, \u2202Q must be a union of spheres so Q is contractible as it is aspherical.\nTo see the general case, first observe any component of CT \u2229 Q is separating in Q as\nb1 (Q) = 0. If there were a ridge subchunk S \u2282 Q with a ridge annulus or torus, then\nany regular chunk R adjacent to S would have at least one component of \u2202R which is not\na sphere since it contains an essential loop, so b1 (S ) \u2265 1. The union Q\u2032 of S and all\nits adjacent maximal regular chunks has b1 (Q\u2032 ) \u2265 1 by an easy Mayer-Vietoris argument.\nFurthermore, if S \u2032 is a ridge chunk adjacent to Q\u2032 , let Q\u2032\u2032 is the union of Q\u2032 , S \u2032 and all other\nmaximal regular chunks adjacent to S \u2032 . No matter S \u2032 has a ridge disk, annulus or torus, a\nMayer-Vietoris argument again shows b1 (Q\u2032\u2032 ) \u2265 1. Keep going in this way, then in the\nend we would find b1 (Q) \u2265 1. Since b1 (Q) = 0 by assumption, we see every ridge chunk\nhas a disk ridge, hence is contractible. However, in this case, \u2202T S is a union of disks for\nany ridge chunk S , so for any maximal regular piece R we must have b1 (R) = 0 under\nthe assumption b1 (Q) = 0. This implies Q is also contractible as we mentioned at the\nbeginning. Therefore, Q must be a contractible chunk.\n\u0003\nFor any component J \u0303 \u2282 \u00d1 e of the preimage of a JSJ piece J \u2282 N e , the corresponding\n \u0303 is abelian, and it is called central if \u03c01 ( J)\n \u0303 is\nchunk C J \u0303 = C \u2229 J \u0303 is called elementary if \u03c01 ( J)\na subgroup of the center of \u03c01 (J). A central hyperbolic chunk is always contractible, and a\ncentral Seifert fibered chunk is either contractible or homeomorphic to a trivial S 1 -bundle\nover a disk, and every ridge chunk is central.\nLemma 2.8. If \u03c01 (\u00d1 e ) is non-abelian and b1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1, one may assume C has no contractible chunk, no non-central elementary chunk, and CT = C \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 (T ) has no disk\ncomponent.\nProof. We show this by modifying C. If there is a contractible chunk Q \u2282 C, the cut\nboundary \u2202T Q is a disjoint union of disks. If D \u2282 \u2202T Q were non-separating in C, C \u2032 =\nC \u2212 D will have b1 (C \u2032 ) = 0, then by Lemma 2.7, C \u2032 is contractible, so C is homotopy\nequivalent to a circle, which is impossible as \u03c01 (C) = \u03c01 (\u00d1 e ) is non-abelian by assumption.\nThus D \u2282 \u2202T Q is separating in C, so C \u2212 D = C \u2032 \u2294 C \u2032\u2032 , and b1 (C \u2032 ) = 0 or b1 (C \u2032\u2032 ) =\n0. Say b1 (C \u2032 ) = 0, by Lemma 2.7, C \u2032 is contractible. We may discard a small regular\nneighborhood of C \u2032 from C, and the rest of C \u2032\u2032 is still a Scott core. As there are at most\nfinitely many chunks in C, we may discard all the contractible ones, and obtain a Scott\ncore, still denoted as C, with no contractible chunk. A similar argument shows one may\nassume CT has no disk component. Now for any non-central elementary chunk Q, Q , C\nsince \u03c01 (C) is non-abelian. As C has no contractible chunk, at least one component U of\n\u2202T Q is a torus or an annulus. Note when Q is a hyperbolic chunk, it is homeomorphic\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n9\n\nto U \u00d7 I, and when Q is a Seifert fibered chunk, it is either a trivial S 1 -bundle over an\nannulus if U is a torus, or an I-bundle over an annulus if U is an annulus, since Q is noncentral. Let J \u0303 be the component of the preimage of a regular JSJ piece J such that U is\n \u0303 Suppose there were some other boundary component U \u2032\ncarried by a component T\u0303 \u2282 \u2202 J.\n \u0303 As U, U \u2032 are both essential annuli or tori by\ncarried by some other component T\u0303 \u2032 \u2282 \u2202 J.\n\u2032\nthe construction of Proposition 2.6, T , T cannot be disjoint cylinders or tori, otherwise J \u0303\nwould not be elementary. We conclude T = T \u2032 , hence U = U \u2032 by the construction. It is\n \u0303 induced by the inclusion. We may discard a small\nalso clear that \u03c01 (U) \u001b \u03c01 (Q) \u001b \u03c01 ( J)\nregular neighborhood of Q from C, and the rest is still connected and is a Scott core. Thus\nwe discard all non-central elementary chunks in this fashion. In the end, we may assume C\nto have no non-central elementary chunk. Note also the modifications here do not affect the\nproperties of C described in Proposition 2.6, so we obtain a Scott core C as required. \u0003\n3. Factorization through extended geometric drilling\nIn this section, we show that a map from a given finite 2-complex to an orientable\naspherical compact 3-manifold factorizes up to homotopy through extended drilling along\nsufficiently short geodesics in the hyperbolic pieces (Theorem 3.2) and through extended\ndrillings along a sufficiently sharp cone-fiber in the Seifert fibered pieces (Theorem 3.6).\nWe need the notion of presentation length for the statement and the proof of these results,\nso we introduce it in Subsection 3.1.\n3.1. Presentation length. For a finitely presented group G, the presentation length l(G)\nof G turns out to be useful in 3-manifold topology, especially for the study of hyperbolic\n3-manifolds. For example, Daryl Cooper proved the volume of an orientable closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M is at most \u03c0l(\u03c01(M)) ([7]). Matthew E. White also gave an upper bound\non the diameter of an orientable closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M in terms of l(\u03c01 (M)) in a\npreprint ([28]).\nDefinition 3.1. Suppose G is a nontrivial finitely presented group. For any presentation\nP = (x1 , . . . , xn ; r1 , . . . , rm ) of G with the word-length of each relator |r j | \u2265 2, define the\nlength of P as\nm\nX\nl(P) =\n(|r j | \u2212 2),\nj=1\n\nand the presentation length l(G) of G as the minimum of l(P) among all such presentations.\nNote by adding finitely many generators and discarding single-letter relators, l(G) can\nalways be realized by a triangular presentation, namely of which the word-length of every\nrelator equals 2 or 3. The length of a triangular presentation equals the number of relators\nof length 3.\nAssociated to any finite presentation P of G, there is a presentation 2-complex K, which\nconsists of a single 0-cell \u2217, and 1-cells corresponding to the generators attached to \u2217, and\n2-cells corresponding to the relators attached to the 1-skeleton with respect to P. The\n2-cells are all 2-simplices or bigons if P is triangular.\n3.2. Drilling a short geodesic in a hyperbolic piece. In this subsection, we show that\nmaps factorize through the extended drilling of a short simple closed geodesic in a hyperbolic piece. The precise statement is as follows.\n\n\f10\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nTheorem 3.2. Let G be a finitely presented group, and M be an orientable aspherical compact 3-manifold. Suppose there is a simple closed geodesic \u03b3 in the interior of a hyperbolic\npiece J \u2282 M with length sufficiently small, with respect to some complete hyperbolic metric on the interior of J, but depending only on the presentation length l(G). Then any\nhomomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 \u03c01 (M) factors through the extended Dehn filling epimorphism\n\u03b9e : \u03c01 (N e(\u03b6,m) ) \u2192 \u03c01 (M) of some denominator 0 < m \u2264 T (l(G)), where N = M \u2212 \u03b3, \u03b6 is\nthe meridian of the Margulis tube about \u03b3, and T (n) = 2 * 3n . Namely, \u03c6 = \u03b9e \u25e6 \u03c6e for some\n\u03c6e : G \u2192 \u03c01 (N e ).\nRemark. By Mostow Rigidity, the complete hyperbolic metric on the interior of J is\nunique, of finite volume, if \u2202J consists of tori or is empty.\nWe prove Theorem 3.2 in the rest of this subsection. The approach here is inspired by a\npaper of Matthew E. White ([28]).\nTo begin with, take a presentation 2-complex K of a triangular presentation P achieving\nl(G), and a PL map f : K \u2192 M realizing \u03c6 : G \u2192 \u03c01 (M). We may assume f (K) intersects\nthe JSJ tori T in general position and the image of the 0-simplex \u2217 \u2208 K misses J. Let\n \u030a \u03c1) be the interior of J with the\n\u01eb3 > 0 be the Margulis constant for H3 , and Jgeo = ( J,\ncomplete hyperbolic metric \u03c1 as assumed. By picking a sufficiently small \u01eb < \u01eb3 , we may\nendow M with a complete Riemannian metric so that J is isometric to Jgeo with the open\n\u01eb-thin horocusps corresponding to \u2202J removed.\nWe may homotope f so that f (K)\u2229 J is totally geodesic on each 2-simplex of K, and the\ntotal area of f (K) \u2229 J is at most \u03c0l(P). In fact, we may first homotope f so that f (K) meets\nthe JSJ tori in minimal normal position, (i.e. the number of K (1) \u2229 f \u22121 (T ) is minimal),\nthen homotope rel f \u22121 (T ) so that f (K) \u2229 J becomes totally geodesic. Roughly speaking,\nnoting that K \u2229 f \u22121 (J) is a union of 1-handles (bands) and monkey-handles (hexagons)\nby the normal position assumption, the total area of f (K) \u2229 J is approximately the total\narea of the monkey-handles. The area of each monkey-handle is bounded by \u03c0, which is\nthe area of an ideal hyperbolic triangle, and there are at most l(P) monkey-handles, as\nl(P) equals the number of 2-simplices of K. It is not hard to make a rigorous argument of\nthe estimation using elementary hyperbolic geometry, so the total area of f (K) \u2229 J can be\nbounded by \u03c0l(P).\nA theorem of\nChun Cao, Frederick W. Gehring and Gavin J. Martin [5] says that if \u03b3\n\u221a \u221a\n3\nhas length l < 2\u03c0 ( 2 \u2212 1), then there is an embedded tube V \u2282 M of radius r with the core\ngeodesic \u03b3, such that:\nq\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 (4\u03c0l/ 3) 1\n2\nsinh (r) =\n\u2212 ,\n\u221a\n2\n4\u03c0l/ 3\n[5]. This means if \u03b3 is very short, it lies in a very deep tube V. In particular, any meridian\ndisk of V will have very large area.\nUp to a small adjustment of the radius of V, we may assume f (K) intersects \u2202V in\ngeneral position, and the 0-simplex \u2217 \u2208 K misses V. Denote KV = f \u22121 (V), and K\u2202V =\nf \u22121 (\u2202V). Let \u03b6 \u2282 \u2202V be an oriented simple closed curve bounding a meridian disk in\nV. Topologically, let i : N \u2192 M be the Dehn filling inclusion identifying N as M \\ V\u030a.\nRemember N e = N e(\u03b6,m) = N \u222a Z(m), where Z(m) is the ridge piece of some denominator\nm > 0. We must show if \u03b3 is sufficiently short, then for some denominator m, there is a\nmap\nf e : K \u2192 Ne,\nsuch that f \u2243 ie \u25e6 f e . The lemma below is an easy criterion.\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n11\n\nLemma 3.3. Suppose f\u2217 : H2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) \u2192 H2 (V, \u2202V; Q) vanishes, and let m > 0 be the\nmaximal order of torsion elements of H1 (KV , K\u2202V ; Z). Then f e |KV , and hence f e , exists for\nN e(\u03b6,m) .\nProof. It suffices to show that there exists a lift f e |KV : KV \u2192 Z(m) commuting with the\ndiagram up to homotopy:\ne\nf\u2202V\n\nK\u2202V \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z(m)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nj\uf8e6\nie \uf8e6\ny\u2229\ny\nfV\n\nKV \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V,\ne\nwhere fV , f\u2202V are the restrictions of f : K \u2192 M to KV , K\u2202V respectively, and f\u2202V\nis f\u2202V postcomposed with \u2202V \u2282 Z(m). This is a relative homotopy extension problem which can be\nresolved by obstruction theory, but we give a manual proof here for the reader's reference.\nBecause \u03c01 (Z(m)) and \u03c01 (V) are abelian, this is the same as finding a lifing \u03c8 : H1 (KV ) \u2192\nH1 (Z(m)) commuting with the diagram above on homology. If f\u2217 : H2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) \u2192\nH2 (V, \u2202V; Q) vanishes, so does f\u2217 : H2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2192 H2 (V, \u2202V) since H2 (V, \u2202V) \u001b Z. Note\nthat since KV is homotopy equivalent to a graph, H2 (KV ) = 0 in the relative homology\nsequence:\n* * * \u2192 H2 (KV ) \u2192 H2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2192 H1 (K\u2202V ) \u2192 H1 (KV ) \u2192 * * * .\nThus H2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2264 H1 (K\u2202V ) is the kernel of H1 (K\u2202V ) \u2192 H1 (KV ). From the commutative\ndiagram:\n0\n\nH2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H2 (V, \u2202V)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\n\n\u2282\n\nH1 (K\u2202V ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1 (\u2202V) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1 (Z(m)),\nwe conclude the kernel of H1 (K\u2202V ) \u2192 H1 (KV ) is contained in the kernel of H1 (K\u2202V ) \u2192\nH1 (Z(m)). Denote A = H1 (KV ), B = Im{H1 (K\u2202V ) \u2192 H1 (KV )}. Since A is a finitely\ngenerated abelian group, A = B\u0304 \u2295 Z[u1 ] \u2295 * * * \u2295 Z[ut ] where B\u0304/B is torsion and [ui ] \u2208 A,\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t. Take m > 0 to be the least common multiple of the orders of elements\nin B\u0304/B (equivalently, the maximal order of torsion elements in H1 (KV , K\u2202V ; Z)). Then\n\u03c8 : A \u2192 H1 (Z(m)) can be constructed as follows. Let \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202V be a slope intersecting the\nfilling slope \u03b6 \u2282 \u2202V in one point, such that ie\u2217 [\u03b7] = [\u03b3]. For any [ui ], 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, define\n\u03c8([ui ]) = [\u0169i ] \u2208 H1 (Z(m)) such that ie\u2217 [\u0169i ] = fV\u2217 [ui ]. For any [v] \u2208 B\u0304 with order s > 0 in\nB\u0304/B, let [w] \u2208 H1 (K\u2202V ) be such that j\u2217 (w) = s [v]. Note fV\u2217 (s [v]) = s fV\u2217 [v] = sb [\u03b3], for\nsome integer b. Then ie\u2217 f\u2202V\u2217 [w] = ie\u2217 (sb [v]). This means f\u2202V\u2217 [w] = sb [\u03b7] + c [\u03b6] for some\ninteger c. Since s divides m by the choice of m, b[\u03b7] + cs [\u03b6] \u2208 H1 (\u2202V) + Z [\u03b6]\nm \u001b H1 (Z(m)).\nWe may define \u03c8([v]) = b [\u03b7] + cs [\u03b6]. It is straightforward to check \u03c8 is a well-defined\nhomomorphism as required.\n\u0003\nFor any R-coefficient chain of PL singular 2-simplices into M, its area is known as the\nsum of the unsigned pull-back areas of the 2-simplices, weighted by the absolute values\nof the coefficients. Because any PL singular relative Z-cycle which represents a nontrivial\nelement of H2 (V, \u2202V; Z) \u001b Z will have arbitrarily large area if V has sufficiently large\nradius, to apply the criterion in Lemma 3.3, it suffices to show that H2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) has a\ngenerating set whose elements are represented by relative Z-cycles each with area bounded\nin terms of l(P).\n\n\f12\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nK\u2202V\n\na monkey-handle\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\na 0-handle\na 1-handle\nKV\n\nan isolated disk\n\nFigure 2. KV and K\u2202V .\nLemma 3.4. There is a generating set of H2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) whose elements are represented\nby relative Z-cycles each with area bounded by A(l(P)), where A(n) = 27n (9n2 + 4n)\u03c0.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may assume KV does not contain the 0-simplex \u2217 of\nK. Because V is convex and each 2-simplex of K has convex image within the hyperbolic\npiece, KV is a finite union of 0-handles (half-disks), 1-handles (bands), monkey-handles\n(hexagons), and possibly a few isolated disks (disks whose boundary do not meet the 1skeleton of K), cf. Figure 2. It is clear that the number of monkey-handles is at most the\nnumber of 2-simplices, hence bounded by l(P), and the union of 1-handles in KV is an Ibundle over a (possible disconnected) graph. By fixing an orientation for each of them, the\nhandles and the isolated disks give a CW-complex structure on KV in an obvious fashion.\nLet C\u2217 (KV , K\u2202V ), Z\u2217 (KV , K\u2202V ), B\u2217 (KV , K\u2202V ) denote the free Z-modules of cellular relative\nchains, cycles and boundaries, respectively. C2 (KV , K\u2202V ) has a natural basis consisting of\nthe handles and the isolated disks.\nTo prove the lemma, it suffices to find a generating set for Z2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) whose elements are in Z2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2264 C2 (KV , K\u2202V ) with bounded coefficients over the natural basis.\nDecompose KV as:\nKV = S V \u2294 EV \u2294 KV\u2032 ,\nwhere S V is the union of the isolated disk components, EV is the union of the components\nthat contain no monkey-handles, and KV\u2032 is the union of the components that contain at\n\u2032\nleast one monkey-handle. Let S \u2202V , E\u2202V , K\u2202V\nbe the intersection of S V , EV , KV\u2032 with K\u2202V ,\nrespectively.\n\u2032\nZ2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) = Z2 (S V , S \u2202V ; Q) \u2295 Z2 (EV , E\u2202V ; Q) \u2295 Z2 (KV\u2032 , K\u2202V\n; Q).\n\nIt suffices to find bounded generating relative Z-cycles for the direct-summands separately.\nFirst, consider Z2 (S V , S \u2202V ; Q). Clearly, it has a generating set whose elements are the\nisolated disks. Hence absolute value of the coefficients over the natural basis are bounded\n\u2264 1 for every element of the generating set.\nSecondly, consider Z2 (EV , E\u2202V ; Q). We show that it has a generating set whose elements have coefficients bounded \u2264 2 in absolute value over the natural basis. To see\nthis, note E = E I \u222a D1 \u222a * * * \u222a D s is a union of an I-bundle E I over a (possibly disconnected) graph \u0393I together with 0-handles D j , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s. K\u2202V \u2229 E I is an embedded\n\u2202I-bundle E\u2202I . Now Z2 (E I , E\u2202I ; Q) can be generated by all the relative Z-cycles, in fact\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n13\n\nfinitely many, of the following forms: (i) AI \u2208 Z2 (E I , E\u2202I ), where (AI , A\u2202I ) \u2282 (E I , E\u2202I )\nis a sub-I-bundle which is an embedded annulus; or (ii) RI + 2BI + R\u2032I \u2208 Z2 (E I , E\u2202I ),\nwhere (RI , R\u2202I ), (R\u2032I , R\u2032\u2202I ) \u2282 (E I , E\u2202I ) are sub-I-bundles which are embedded M\u00f6bius strips,\nand (BI , B\u2202I ) \u2282 (E I , E\u2202I ) is a sub-I-bundle which is an embedded band joining RI and\nR\u2032I . Moreover, Z2 (EV , E\u2202V ; Q) / Z2 (E I , E\u2202I ; Q) can be generated by the residual classes\nrepresented by all the relative Z-cycles, in fact finitely many, of the following forms: (i)\nD j + BI \u00b1 D j\u2032 \u2208 Z2 (EV , E\u2202V ), where D j , D j\u2032 are distinct 0-handles, and (BI , B\u2202I ) \u2282 (E I , E\u2202I )\nis a sub-I-bundle which is an embedded band joining D j and D j\u2032 ; or (ii) 2D j + 2BI + RI \u2208\nZ2 (EV , E\u2202V ), where D j is a 0-handle, and (RI , R\u2202I ) \u2282 (E I , E\u2202I ) is a sub-I-bundle which is\nan embedded M\u00f6bius strip, and (BI , B\u2202I ) \u2282 (E I , E\u2202I ) is a sub-I-bundle which is an embedded band joining D j and RI . All these relative Z-cycles together generate Z2 (EV , E\u2202V ; Q),\nand each of them has coefficients bounded \u2264 2 in absolute value over the natural basis.\n\u2032\nFinally, consider Z2 (KV\u2032 , K\u2202V\n; Q). We show that it has a generating set whose elements\nhave coefficients bounded \u2264 27l(P) (9l(P) + 4) in absolute value over the natural basis.

Every column of A has at most 3 nonzero entries,\nand the sum of their absolute values is at most 3. Our aim is to find a set of fundamental\nsolutions over Q with bounded integral entries.\nPicking out a maximal independent collection of equations if necessary, we may assume\np equals the rank of A over Q.

For a 1-simplex \u03c3\n \u0304 n\u2217 , we pick a sub-I-bundle of K \u2032 which is an embedded band\nparallel to \u03c6l coming from \u2202U\nI,l\n\u2032\n) be the relative Z-chain which is the algebraic\njoining \u03c3 and \u03c6l , and let Ln \u2208 C2 (KI\u2032 , K\u2202I\nsum of all such sub-I-bundles. Since each sub-I-bundle as a relative Z-chain has coefficient\nbounded by 1 in absolute value over the natural basis, the absolute values of coefficients\nof Ln are bounded \u2264 3 * 3 p (p + 1) = 3 p+1 (p + 1). Let \u00dbn = Un\u2217 \u2212 Ln , 1 \u2264 n \u2264 q \u2212 p, then\n\u2202 \u0304 \u00dbn = 0, with coefficients bounded \u2264 3 p+1 (p + 1) + 3 p = 3 p (3p + 4) in absolute value.\n\u2032\nIn other words, \u00dbn \u2208 Z2 (KV\u2032 , K\u2202V\n), 1 \u2264 n \u2264 q \u2212 p. Moreover, \u00dbn 's together with a gen\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nerating set of Z2 (KI , K\u2202I ; Q) generate Z2 (KV\u2032 , K\u2202V\n; Q). Note KI\u2032 has no monkey-handle,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n; Q) has a generating set of relative\nthe no-monkey-handle case implies that Z2 (KI , K\u2202I\n\u2032\n; Q)\nZ-cycles with coefficients bounded by 2 in absolute value. Therefore, Z2 (KV\u2032 , K\u2202V\nhas a generating set of relative Z-cycles, consisting of \u00dbn 's and the generating set of\n\u2032\nZ2 (KI\u2032 , K\u2202I\n; Q) as above, with coefficients bounded by 3 p (3p + 4) in absolute value. Remember p \u2264 3t \u2264 3l(P), the absolute values of coefficients are bounded \u2264 33l(P) (3*3l(P)+\n4) = 27l(P) (9l(P) + 4).\n\u2032\nTo sum up, putting the generating sets of Z2 (S V , S \u2202V ; Q), Z2 (EV , E\u2202V ; Q), Z2 (KV\u2032 , K\u2202V\n; Q)\ntogether, we obtain a generating set of Z2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) of relative Z-cycles with coefficients\nbounded by 27l(P) (9l(P) + 4) over the natural basis. In particular, they represent homology\nclasses that generate H2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q). Remember the natural basis of C2 (KV , K\u2202V ) consists\nof handles and isolated disks, whose total area is bounded by \u03c0l(P). Therefore, the generating set consists of relative Z-cycles with area bounded \u2264 27l(P) (9l(P) + 4) * Area(KV ) \u2264\nA(l(P)), where A(n) = 27n (9n2 + 4n)\u03c0.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma bounds the torsion orders of H1 (KV , K\u2202V ; Z):\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n15\n\nLemma 3.5. The maximal order of torsion elements of H1 (KV , K\u2202V ; Z) is bounded by\nT (l(P)), where T (n) = 2 * 3n .\nProof. It suffices to show that for any component CV of KV , the order of torsion elements\nof H1 (CV , C\u2202V ; Z) is at most T (l(P)), where C\u2202V = K\u2202V \u2229 CV . If CV is an isolated disk,\nH1 (CV , C\u2202V ; Z) is trivial. Thus we may assume CV is a union of 0-handles, 1-handles and\nmonkey-handles.\nLet EV be a maximal union of 1-handles in CV which forms a trivial I-bundle over a\n(possibly disconnected) finite graph (we also include in EV isolated edges which are not\ncontained in any such trivial I-bundle, which may be thought of as trivial I-bundles over\nj\nisolated vertices of the finite graph). Suppose EV = EV1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 EVs , where each EV is a\nconnected component, and let e j be a (directed) fiber of EVj . Clearly, H1 (EV , E\u2202V ; Z), where\nE\u2202V = EV \u2229 K\u2202V , is torsion-free, rank-s, spanned by:\n[e1 ], * * * , [e s ].\n\nMoreover, H1 (CV , C\u2202V ; Z) is generated by these [e j ]'s as well. Suppose \u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3r are the\nrest of the handles of CV , i.e. which are not in EV . The boundary of each \u03c3i gives a linear\ncombination:\nai1 [e1 ] + * * * + ais [e s ] \u2208 H1 (EV , E\u2202V ; Z).\ni\nMoreover, if \u03c3 is a 0-handle or 1-handle, there is only one non-zero coefficient which is\n\u00b11 or \u00b12, respectively, (the 1-handle case follows from the maximality of EV ). If \u03c3i is\na monkey-handle, the absolute value of coefficients sum up to 3, so in particular, at most\nthree entries are non-zero. Thus we obtain an integral r \u00d7 s-matrix A = (ai j ), which is a\npresentation matrix of the module H1 (CV , C\u2202V ; Z), so that at most t rows have more than\none non-zero entry, where t \u2264 l(P). We may suppose these are the first t rows, forming\na t \u00d7 s-submatrix A\u2032 , and the rest of the (r \u2212 t) rows form a (r \u2212 t) \u00d7 s-submatrix A\u2032\u2032 .\nNote the entries of A\u2032 have absolute value at most 3, so the order of any torsion elements\nof Coker(A\u2032 ) is bounded by the greatest common divisor of the minors of A\u2032 of square\nsubmatrices of size rank(A\u2032 ), and hence is bounded by 3t . As H1 (CV , C\u2202V ; Z) is the quotient\nof A\u2032 by further killing relators given by rows of A\u2032\u2032 , which at most doubles the order of\nthe torsion, we conclude that the orders of torsion elements of H1 (CV , C\u2202V ; Z) is at most\n2 * 3t , where t \u2264 l(P). This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nTo finish the proof of Theorem 3.2, if the area of the meridian disk of V is larger than\nA(l(P)) as in Lemma 3.4, then f\u2217 : H2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2192 H2 (V, \u2202V) vanishes. This amounts to\nrequiring the radius r of V satisfy:\n\u03c0 sinh2 (r) > A(l(P)).\nIf \u03b3 is so short that this inequality holds, by Lemma 3.3, we may factorize any f : K \u2192\nM up to homotopy, and hence any \u03c6 : G \u2192 \u03c01 (M), through the extended Dehn filling.\nThe denominator of the drilling is bounded by the order of the torsion of H1 (KV , K\u2202V ) by\nLemma 3.3. By Lemma 3.5, the order of the torsion is bounded by T (l(G)). This completes\nthe proof of Theorem 3.2.\n3.3. Drilling a sharp cone-fiber in a Seifert fibered piece. In this subsection, we show\na similar result to Theorem 3.2 for Seifert fibered pieces, that maps factorize through the\nextended drilling of an exceptional fiber at a sharp cone point in a Seifert fibered piece. To\nmake this precise, we need recall some facts about Seifert fibered spaces.\nLet J be an orientable compact Seifert fibered space. The interior of J may be regarded\nas an S 1 -bundle over a finitely generated 2-orbifold O. In general, O is isomorphic to\n\n\f16\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\na surface with cone points and/or punctures F(q1 , * * * , q s ), where F is a closed (possibly\nnon-orientable) surface, and each integer 1 < qi \u2264 \u221e (1 \u2264 i \u2264 s) corresponds to either\na cone point on F with the cone angle 2\u03c0\nqi if qi < \u221e, or a puncture if qi = \u221e. O can be\nendowed with a complete hyperbolic structure of finite area if and only if the orbifold Euler\nPs\ncharacteristic \u03c7(O) = \u03c7(F) \u2212 i=1\n(1 \u2212 q1i ) is negative, where \u221e1 = 0 by convention. In other\nf 2 (R)-geometric. In an orientable\nwords, in this case J is either E \u00d7 H2 -geometric or SL\naspherical compact 3-manifold M, any Seifert fibered piece J whose base 2-orbifold has a\nsufficiently sharp cone point (i.e. the cone angle is sufficiently small) is E \u00d7 H2 -geometric,\nf 2 (R)-geometric. In fact, if M is neither SL\nf 2 (R)-geometric nor virtually\nunless M is itself SL\nsolvable, any Seifert piece J is either E \u00d7 H2 -geometric or homeomorphic to the nontrivial\nS 1 -bundle over a M\u00f6bius strip.\nTheorem 3.6. Let G be a finitely presented group, and M be an orientable aspherical\ncompact 3-manifold. Suppose there is a sufficiently sharp cone point in the base 2-orbifold\nof a Seifert fibered piece J \u2282 M, depending only on the presentation length l(G). Let \u03b3 \u2282 J\nbe the corresponding exceptional fiber, and N = M \u2212 \u03b3 be the drilling along \u03b3. Then any\nhomomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 \u03c01 (M) factors through the extended Dehn filling epimorphism\n\u03b9e : \u03c01 (N e ) \u2192 \u03c01 (M) of some denominator m \u2264 T (l(G)). Namely, \u03c6 = \u03b9e \u25e6 \u03c6e for some\n\u03c6e : G \u2192 \u03c01 (N e ).\nThe proof is almost the same as the hyperbolic case, so we only give a sketch highlighting necessary modifications.\nf 2 (R)-geometric, and let Jgeo = ( J,\n \u030a \u03c1)\nWe may assume J is either E \u00d7 H2 -geometric or SL\nbe the interior of J with a complete Riemanianian metric \u03c1 of finite volume, induced by a\ncomplete hyperbolic structure on its base 2-orbifold O requiring the length of any ordinary\nfiber to be 1. Let x \u2208 O be the cone point as assumed with cone angle 2\u03c0\nq . A result of Gaven\nJ. Martin implies that for any complete hyperbolic 2-orbifold O with a cone point of angle\n2\u03c0\nq , there is an embedded cone centered at the point with radius r satisfying:\ncosh(r) =\n\n1\n,\n2 sin \u03c0q\n\nwhich is optimal in S 2 (2, 3, q), (cf. [15, Theorem 2.2]). Applying to x as above, the\npreimage of the embedded cone in Jgeo is a tube, which will have very large radius if the\ncone is very sharp.\nThere is a natural notion of the horizontal area of a PL singular 2-complex in Jgeo ,\nheuristically the area of its projection on the base 2-orbifold. Formally, let \u03c9\u0303 be the pullf 2 (R) \u2192 H2 ,\nback of the area form of H2 via the natural projection E \u00d7 H2 \u2192 H2 or SL\nwhich is invariant under isometry. As it is invariant under the holonomy action of \u03c01 (Jgeo),\n\u03c9\u0303 descends to a 2-form \u03c9 on Jgeo . For any PL singular 2-simplex j : \u2206 \u2192 Jgeo , we define\nthe horizontal area to be:\nZ\nAreah ( j(\u2206)) =\nj\u2217 \u03c9 ,\n\u2206\n\nand define the horizontal area of a R-coefficient PL singular 2-chain in Jgeo to be the sum\nof the horizontal areas of its simplices, weighted by the absolute values of coefficients.\nf 2 (R)-geometry, any path in Jgeo\nBecause for the E \u00d7 H2 -geometry, resp. for the SL\ncan be pulled straight, namely, homotoped rel end-points to a unique geodesic segment.\nMoreover, any immersed 2-simplex in Jgeo can be homotoped rel vertices to a ruled 2simplex with geodesic sides. In fact, let \u2206 = [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]/ \u223c where (t, 0) \u223c (t\u2032 , 0) for\nany (0 \u2264 t, t\u2032 \u2264 1), and j : \u2206 \u2192 Jgeo be an immersion in its interior. One may first\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n17\n\npull straight the sides by homotopy, then simultaneously homotope so that j({t} \u00d7 [0, 1])\nf 2 (R),\nbecomes geodesic for every 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. Note every geodesic in E \u00d7 H2 , resp. in SL\nprojects to a geodesic in H2 , it is clear that any ruled 2-simplex (lifted) in E \u00d7 H2 , resp. in\nf 2 (R), projects to a totally geodesic triangle in H2 . This implies any ruled 2-simplex in\nSL\nJgeo has horizontal area at most \u03c0. More generally, ruled triangular 2-complexes in Jgeo\nwith m 2-simplices have horizontal area at most m\u03c0.\nTo prove Theorem 3.6, pick a presentation 2-complex K of a triangular presentation P\nachieving l(G), and a PL map f : K \u2192 M realizing \u03c6. By picking a sufficiently small\n\u01eb < \u01eb2 , we may endow M with a complete Riemannian metric such that J is isometric to\nJgeo with the \u01eb-thin tubes corresponding to \u2202J removed. We pull the part of f \u22121 (J) straight,\nnamely, homotope it rel f \u22121 (\u2202J) to a ruled 2-complex. If \u01eb is sufficiently small, we may\nassume the horizontal area of f \u22121 (J) to be at most \u03c0l(P) by the discussion above.\nSuppose \u03b3 is the singular fiber in J with sufficiently small cone angle, then there is an\nembedded tube V \u2282 J containing \u03b3 with sufficiently large radius. Since V is convex and\nthe simplices meeting V are ruled, it is easy to see that KV = f \u22121 (V) is a finite union of\n0-handles, 1-handles and monkey-handles and possible a few isolated disks. The number\nof monkey-handles is at most the number of simplices l(P). Let K\u2202V = f \u22121 (\u2202V). Now the\nhorizontal area of KV is at most \u03c0l(P).\nThe factorization criterion in Lemma 3.3 is a general fact which also applies here. By\nthe same argument as Lemma 3.4, H2 (KV , K\u2202V ; Q) has a generating set whose elements\nare represented by relative Z-cycles with horizontal area bounded by 27l(P) (9l(P) + 4) *\nAreah (KV ) \u2264 27l(P) (9l(P)2 + 4l(P))\u03c0. Thus, if \u03b3 is an exceptional fiber with the corresponding cone angle sufficiently small such that it has a tubular neighborhood V \u2282 M of\nradius r satisfying:\n\u03c0 sinh2 (r) > A(l(P)),\nwhere A(n) = 27n (9n2 + 4n)\u03c0, f\u2217 : H2 (KV , K\u2202V ) \u2192 H2 (V, \u2202V) vanishes. This implies\nf : K \u2192 M factors through the extended Dehn filling ie : N e(\u03b6,m) \u2192 M up to homotopy,\nwhere denominator m of the drilling is bounded by the order of the torsion of H1 (KV , K\u2202V )\nby Lemma 3.3. By Lemma 3.5, the order of the torsion is bounded by T (l(G)). This\ncompletes the proof of Theorem 3.6.\n4. A bound of the simplicial volume\nIn this section, we give an upper-bound of the volume of M in terms of G, under the\nassumptions of Theorem 1.1. This gives some restrictions to the geometry of the hyperbolic\npieces of M, which will be useful in Section 7. For the purpose of certain independent\ninterest, we prefer to prove a slightly more general result, allowing M to be an compact\norientable aspherical 3-manifold with tori boundary.\nFor any compact orientable manifold M with tori boundary, we denote the simplicial\nvolume of M as v3 kMk, where v3 \u2248 1.01494 is the volume of an ideal regular hyperbolic\ntetrahedron and kMk stands for the Gromov norm. We prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose G is a finitely presented group with b1 (G) = 1, and M is an orientable compact aspherical 3-manifold with (possibly empty) tori boundary. If G maps\nonto \u03c01 (M), then:\nv3 kNk \u2264 \u03c0l(G).\nMore generally, one may assume that G is only finitely generated with b1 (G) = 1 in this\ntheorem, since any such group is the quotient of a finitely presented group G\u2032 \u0589 G with\nb1 (G\u2032 ) = 1. We shall prove Theorem 4.1 in the rest of this section.\n\n\f18\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nThe idea is as follows. First take a finite 2-complex K realizing a triangular presentation\nP which achieves l(G). Take a PL map f : K \u2192 M realizing an epimorphism \u03c6 : G \u0589\n\u03c01 (M). We first show that M \u2212 f (K) consists of elementary components, in the sense\nthat the inclusion of any such component induces a homomorphism on \u03c01 with abelian\nimage. By 'pulling straight' f in hyperbolic pieces of M via homotopy, we may apply an\nisoperimetric inequality to bound the sum of their volumes by \u03c0l(P). Then the theorem\nfollows because v3 kMk is equal to the sum of the volume of hyperbolic pieces.\nWe first show M\u2212 f (K) consists of elementary components. The approach we are taking\nhere is a 'drilling argument' which will also be used to prove Theorem 1.1.\nProposition 4.2. Let K be a finite 2-complex with b1 (K) = 1, and M be an orientable\ncompact aspherical 3-manifold. Suppose f : K \u2192 M is a PL map (with respect to any\nPL structures of K, M) which induces an epimorphism on the fundamental group. Then\nM \u2212 f (K) consists of elementary components, i.e. whose inclusion into M has abelian\n\u03c01 -image.\nProof. This is trivial if M is itself elementary. We shall assume M to be non-elementary\nwithout loss of generality.\nTo argue by contradiction, suppose there is a non-elementary component U of M\u2212 f (K).\nWe may take an embedded finite connected simplicial graph \u0393 \u2282 U such that \u0393 is nonelementary in M, i.e. \u03c01 (\u0393) \u2192 \u03c01 (M) has non-abelian image. Let N = M \u2212 \u0393. Observe that\nN is aspherical, because if there is an embedded sphere in N, it bounds a ball in M. This\nball cannot contain \u0393 as \u0393 is non-elementary, and hence the ball is contained in N. Thus,\nN is irreducible, and therefore aspherical by the Sphere Theorem [18]. Denote the induced\nmap:\nf \u2032 : K \u2192 N.\nBy picking base points of K and N, there is an induced homomorphism f\u266f\u2032 : \u03c01 (K) \u2192\n\u03c01 (N). Note Im( f\u266f\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03c01 (N) is in general of infinite index as b1 (K) = 1 and b1 (N) > 1. We\nconsider the covering space \u00d1 of N corresponding to Im( f\u266f\u2032 ), with the covering map:\n\u03ba : \u00d1 \u2192 N.\n\nAssume we can prove \u03c7(\u00d1) < 0, and hence b1 (\u00d1) > 1 at this point, then we obtain a\ncontradiction because b1 (K) = 1 and \u03c01 (\u00d1) \u001b Im( f\u266f\u2032 ). We shall show \u03c7(\u00d1) < 0 in a\n\u0003\nseparate lemma, (Lemma 4.3), and with that done, the proof is completed.\nLemma 4.3. With the assumptions in the proof of Proposition 4.2,\n\u03c7(\u00d1) < 0.\nProof. Let T be the JSJ tori of N. Note \u2202M is at most a torus under the assumption that\nf : K \u2192 M is \u03c01 -surjective and b1 (K) = 1. Consider the JSJ decomposition of N. Then the\npiece Y containing the component of \u2202N coming from drilling \u0393 is necessarily hyperbolic,\nand \u03c7(Y) < 0. Let Y\u0393 \u2282 M be the union of Y with the component of M \u2212 Y that contains \u0393.\nTo argue by contradiction, suppose b1 (\u00d1) = 1.\nBy Proposition 2.6 \u00d1 has an aspherical Scott core C such that C \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 (T ) are essential\nannuli and/or tori. Moreover, by Lemma 2.8, C has no non-central elementary chunk, in\nparticular, no elementary hyperbolic chunk. We claim that C contains a hyperbolic chunk\n\u03ba\nQ mapping to Y under C \u2282 \u00d1 \u2192 N.\nTo see this, note f \u2032 : K \u2192 N factorizes as:\nf \u0303\u2032\n\n\u2282\n\n\u03ba\n\nK \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 \u00d1 \u2212\u2192 N,\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n19\n\nup to homotopy. If C had no hyperbolic chunk mapping to Y, f \u2032 would miss the interior\nof Y\u0393 up to homotopy. Then f : K \u2192 M may be homotoped to g : K \u2192 M within N\nsuch that g(K) misses the interior of Y\u0393 . Clearly \u2202Y\u0393 has some component which is not\nparallel to \u2202M, because otherwise either \u0393 or g(K) is contained in a collar neighborhood\nof \u2202M. This either contradicts \u0393 being non-elementary, or contradicts f \u2243 g being \u03c01 surjective as M is assumed to be non-elementary. Let T be such a component of \u2202Y\u0393 .\nT cannot be incompressible in M, otherwise g(K) is not surjective by the Van Kampen\ntheorem or the HNN extension. If T is compressible, let D \u2282 M be a compressing disk\nof T . One component of \u2202W, where W is a regular neighborhood of D \u222a T , is a sphere\nS \u2282 M, which must bound a ball B \u2282 M. There are four cases: if D \u2282 Y\u0393 and B \u2282 Y\u0393 ,\nthen Y\u0393 is a solid torus containing \u0393, which contradicts \u0393 being non-elementary; if D \u2282 Y\u0393\nand B \u2282 (M \\ Y\u030a\u0393 ) \u222a W, then B contains g(K), which contradicts g being \u03c01 -surjective; if\nD \u2282 M \\ Y\u030a\u0393 and B \u2282 M \\ Y\u030a\u0393 , then M \\ Y\u030a\u0393 is a solid torus containing g(K), which contradicts\nthe assumption that M is non-elementary; if D \u2282 M \\ Y\u030a\u0393 and B \u2282 W \u222a Y\u0393 , then B contains\n\u0393, which contradicts \u0393 being non-elementary. This means T cannot be compressible either.\nThis contradiction proves the claim that C must have some hyperbolic chunk Q.\nNow Q is a non-elementary hyperbolic chunk of C by Lemma 2.8. Let \u1ef8 be the component of \u03ba\u22121 (Y) containing Q. We have \u03c01 (Q) \u001b \u03c01 (\u1ef8) \u2264 \u03c01 (Y) is a non-elementary\nsubgroup of \u03c01 (Y). Since \u03c7(Y) < 0, we conclude \u03c7(Q) < 0. Because C cuts along annuli\nand tori into non-contractible chunks,\n\u03c7(\u00d1) = \u03c7(C) \u2264 \u03c7(Q) < 0.\nThis implies b1 (\u00d1) > 1 as Hn (\u00d1) = 0 for n > 2, a contradiction to the assumption that\nb1 (\u00d1) = 1.\n\u0003\nLet J1 , * * * , J s (s \u2265 0) be the hyperbolic pieces in the JSJ decomposition of M as assumed in Theorem 4.1. As before, we write Ji, geo = ( J \u030ai , \u03c1i ) for the interior of Ji with the\ncomplete hyperbolic metric of finite volume. It is a well-known fact that only hyperbolic\npieces contribute to the simplicial volume, namely,\nv3 kMk =\n\ns\nX\n\nVol(Ji, geo ),\n\ni=1\n\ncf. [25, Theorem 1]. Therefore, to prove Theorem 4.1, it suffices to bound the volume of\nhyperbolic pieces of M, assuming s > 0.\nBy picking a positive \u01eb < \u01eb3 , where \u01eb3 is the Margulis constant for H3 , we may endow M\nwith a complete Riemannian metric so that Ji is isometric to Ji, geo with the \u01eb-thin horocusps\ncorresponding to \u2202Ji removed, (remember the JSJ pieces are the components of M with an\nopen regular neighborhood of the JSJ tori removed).\nRemember K is a finite 2-complex with a single base point \u2217 and 2-simplices corresponding to the relators of the triangular presentation P. If \u01eb > 0 is sufficiently small, we\nmay homotope f so that \u2217 is not in any hyperbolic piece, and that f (K) \u2229 Ji is totally geodesic on each 2-simplex of K. As K Ji = f \u22121 (Ji ) is a union of 1-handles (bands) and at most\nl(P) monkey-handles (hexagons), we may bound the area of K Ji by \u03c0mi , where mi is the\nnumber of monkey-handles in K Ji , if \u01eb > 0 is sufficiently small. Note m1 + * * * + m s \u2264 l(P).\n2\nMoreover, the area of \u2202Ji is bounded by \u01eb \u01eb 2Ai , where Ai is total area of the \u01eb3 -horocusp\n3\nboundaries of Ji, geo corresponding to \u2202Ji .\nWe need an isoperimetric inequality as below at this point (cf. [19, Lemma 3.2]).\n\n\f20\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nLemma 4.4. Let Y be a hyperbolic 3-manifold, and R \u2282 Y be a connected compact PL\nsub-3-manifold. If R is elementary in Y, then\nVol(R) \u2264\n\n1\nArea(\u2202R).\n2\n\nProof. Pass to the covering of X of Y corresponding to the image of \u03c01 (R) \u2192 \u03c01 (Y), then\nthere is a copy of R in X lifted from R \u2282 Y. As R is elementary in Y, \u03c01 (X) is free abelian\nof rank \u2264 2, so we pick a \u03c01 -injective map to a torus f : X \u2192 T 2 . Let W \u2282 T 2 be the\nunion of two generator slopes on T 2 meeting in one point. We may assume f and f |\u2202R are\ntransversal to both circles in W, then \u03a3 = f \u22121 (W) is a 2-sub-complex in X with finite area\n(since compact and measurable) such that the universal covering space X\u0303, isometric to H3 ,\ncan be constructed by gluing copies of Cg = X \\ \u03a3 indexed by g \u2208 \u03c01 (X). Let \u03ba : X\u0303 \u2192 X,\nthen any connected component R\u0303 of \u03ba\u22121 (R) is a universal covering of R. To illustrate,\nconsider \u03c01 (X) \u001b Z \u2295 Z for instance, and let \u03b1, \u03b2 be two generators such that C\u03b1 \u2229 C0 , \u2205,\nC\u03b2 \u2229 C0 , \u2205. For any m > 0, let R\u0303n be the union of all the R\u0303 \u2229 Ci \u03b1+ j \u03b2 , where \u2212m \u2264 i, j \u2264 m.\nIt is clear Vol(R\u0303m ) = 4m2 Vol(R), and Area(\u2202R\u0303n ) = 4m2 Area(\u2202R) + 2m Area(\u03a3). Using the\nisoperimetric inequality in H3 , we have\nVol(R\u0303m ) \u2264\n\n1\nArea(\u2202R\u0303m ).\n2\n\nThis implies Vol(R) \u2264 21 Area(\u2202R) as m \u2192 +\u221e. When \u03c01 (X) is isomorphic to Z or trivial,\nthe argument is similar.\n\u0003\nTo finish the proof of Theorem 4.1, by Proposition 4.2, the compactification of each\ncomponents of Ji \\ f (K) is also elementary. Thus, by Lemma 4.4, Vol(Ji ) \u2264 \u03c0mi + \u01eb 2 Ai /\u01eb32 .\nWe obtain:\ns\ns\ns\nX\nX\n\u01eb2A\n\u01eb2 X\nAi \u2264 \u03c0l(P) + 2 ,\nVol(Ji ) \u2264 \u03c0\nmi + 2\n\u01eb3 i=1\n\u01eb3\ni=0\ni=1\nwhere A = A1 + * * * + A s is a constant independent of \u01eb > 0. As \u01eb \u2192 0, the left-hand side\nPs\ngoes to v3 kMk = i=1\nVol(Ji, geo ), and the right-hand side goes to \u03c0l(P). We conclude:\nv3 kMk \u2264 \u03c0l(P).\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.\n5. The JSJ decomposition of knot complements\nIn this section, we review the JSJ decomposition of knot complements following [4],\nand provide an equivalent data-structural description of a knot complement as a rooted tree\nwith vertices decorated by compatible geometric nodes, (Proposition 5.6). This is in preparation of the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nLet k be a knot in S 3 . For the knot complement M = S 3 \u2212 k, i.e. S 3 with an open regular\nneighborhood of k removed, the JSJ graph \u039b is a finite tree as every embedded torus in S 3\nis separating. Moreover, \u039b has a natural rooted tree structure. Recall that a finite tree is\nrooted if it has a specified vertex, called the root. The edges are naturally directed toward\nthe root, thus every non-root vertex has a unique parent adjacent to it. The adjacent vertices\nof a vertex except its parent are called its children. Every vertex is contained in a unique\ncomplete rooted subtree, namely the maximal subtree with the induced edge directions in\nwhich the vertex becomes the root.\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n21\n\n~ is a rooted\nDefinition 5.1. For a knot complement M, the associated rooted JSJ tree \u039b\ntree isomorphic to the JSJ tree \u039b of M with the root corresponding to the unique JSJ piece\ncontaining \u2202M.\nThe rooted JSJ tree is related to the satellite constructions of knots. In fact, for any\n~ c \u2282 \u039b,\n~ the subspace Mc \u2282 M over \u039b\n~ c is homeomorphic to the\ncomplete rooted subtree \u039b\n3\n~ \\\u039b\n~ c is homeomorphic\ncomplement of a knot kc in S , and the subspace N \u2282 M over \u039b\n1\n2\nto the complement of a knot kp in a solid torus S \u00d7 D with the natural product structure.\nThus k is the satellite knot of kc \u2282 S 3 and kp \u2282 S 1 \u00d7 D2 .\nTo give a more precise description of the JSJ pieces and how they are glued together,\n[4] introduced the notion of KGLs.\nDefinition 5.2 ([4, Definition 4.4]). A knot-generating link (KGL) is an oriented link L =\nkp \u2294 kc1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 kcr \u2282 S 3 , (r \u2265 0), such that kc1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 kcr is an oriented unlink.\nExample 5.3. Figure 3 exhibits three families of KGLs, namely, (right-handed) r-keychain links (r > 1), p/q-torus knots (p, q coprime, |p| > 1, q > 1), and p/q-cable links\n(p, q coprime, q > 1). Their complements are all Seifert fibered. There are also hyperbolic KGLs, namely whose complements are hyperbolic, such as the Borromean rings with\nsuitable assignments of components.\nPSfrag replacements\n\nkp\nkc3\n\nkp\n\nr-key-chain link, as r = 3\n\np/q-torus knot, as p/q = \u22122/3\n\nkc1\n\nkc2\n\nkc1\n\nkp\n\np/q-cable link, as p/q = 1/3\n\nFigure 3. Three families of Seifert fibered KGLs.\nAccording to [4], the JSJ decomposition of knot complements may be described as\nbelow.\n~ be the\nTheorem 5.4 (Cf. [4, Theorem 4.18]). Suppose k is a nontrivial knot in S 3 . Let \u039b\nrooted JSJ tree of M = S 3 \u2212 k. Then:\n\n~ is associated to a KGL, Lv = kp \u2294 kc1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 kcr \u2282 S 3 , satisfying the\n(1) Every vertex v \u2208 \u039b\nfollowing requirements: the JSJ piece Jv corresponding to v is homeomorphic to S 3 \u2212 Lv ;\n\u2202Jv = \u2202p Jv \u2294 \u2202c1 Jv \u2294 * * * \u2294 \u2202cr Jv , r \u2265 0, where \u2202p Jv is the torus adjacent to the parent\npiece of Jv , or is \u2202M if v is the root, and each \u2202ci Jv is adjacent to a distinct child vertex\nof v; and if v\u2032 is a child of v, and let kc\u2032 \u2282 Lv , kp\u2032 \u2282 Lv\u2032 be the components so that \u2202c\u2032 Jv\nis glued to \u2202p Jv\u2032 , then the meridian of kc\u2032 is glued to the longitude of kp\u2032 \u2282 S 3 preserving\norientations. Note the longitude and the meridian of a component of an oriented link are\nnaturally oriented.\n~\n(2) There are only four possible families of KGLs that could be associated to vertices of \u039b,\nnamely, r-key-chain links (r > 1), p/q-torus knots (p, q coprime, |p| > 1, q > 1), p/q-cable\nlinks (p, q coprime, q > 1), and hyperbolic KGLs. Furthermore, no key-chain-link vertex\nhas a key-chain-link child.\n\n\f22\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\n(3) The associated KGLs are canonical up to unoriented isotopies of Lv 's with respect to\n~ with an assignment of vertices to KGLs\nthe requirements. Moreover, any rooted tree \u039b\nsatisfying the properties above realizes a unique nontrivial knot k in S 3 up to isotopy.\n~ containIn view of the satellite construction, the minimal complete rooted subtree of \u039b\ning a cable-link vertex corresponds to the complement of a cable knot, and the minimal\n~ containing a key-chain-link vertex corresponds to the comcomplete rooted subtree of \u039b\nplement of a connected sum of knots.\nFor our purpose of use, we prefer to encode a KGL by its complement, forgetting the\nembedding into S 3 , but remembering the children longitudes:\nDefinition 5.5. A node is a triple (J, \u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }), r \u2265 0, where J is an oriented\ncompact 3-manifold homeomorphic to an irreducible (r + 1)-component KGL complement\nwith incompressible boundary, \u03bcp and \u03bbci 's are slopes on distinct components of \u2202J, i.e.\noriented simple closed curves up to isotopy on \u2202J, such that the Dehn filling of J along \u03bcp\nyields an r-component unlink complement with meridian slopes {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr } . We call \u03bcp\nthe parent meridian and the \u03bbci 's the children longitudes. It is compatible with a vertex v in\n~ if r equals the number of the children of v. Two nodes (J, \u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }),\na rooted tree \u039b\n(J \u2032 , \u03bc\u2032p , {\u03bb\u2032c1 , * * * , \u03bb\u2032cr\u2032 }) are isomorphic if there is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism\nbetween the pairs (J, \u03bcp \u2294 \u03bbc1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 \u03bbcr ) and (J \u2032 , \u03bc\u2032p \u2294 \u03bb\u2032c1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 \u03bb\u2032cr\u2032 ), and in particular,\nr = r\u2032 .\nRemark. For a node (J, \u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }), \u2202J is the disjoint union of components \u2202p J \u2294\n\u2202c1 J \u2294 * * *\u2294 \u2202cr J, such that \u03bcp \u2282 \u2202p J and \u03bbci \u2282 \u2202ci J for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Each \u2202ci J is called a child\nboundary, and \u2202p J is called the parent boundary. The parent meridian \u03bcp is determined\nup to finitely many possibilities by {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }, and up to orientation. If J is a key-chain,\nthen \u03bcp is the boundary slope induced by the Seifert fibering. If J is a torus knot, then \u03bcp is\ndetermined by the unique meridian which makes it a knot complement. If J is a cable link,\nthen \u03bcp must intersect the fiber slope once if Dehn filling is to give the unknot. All of these\npossible meridians intersecting the fiber slope once are related by Dehn twists along the\nannulus connecting the two boundary components, and therefore \u03bcp is uniquely determined\nby \u03bbc1 . Otherwise, if J is hyperbolic, then there are at most 3 possibilities for \u03bcp \u2282 \u2202p J\nby [8, Theorem 2.4.4]. There are naturally defined children meridians, up to isotopy on\n\u2202J, which are the oriented simple closed curves \u03bcci \u2282 \u2202ci J such that \u03bcci is null-homotopic\nin the Dehn filling of J along \u03bcp , and that the orientation induced by (\u03bbci , \u2212\u03bcci ) coincides\nwith that of \u2202ci J. There is also a naturally defined parent longitude \u03bbp \u2282 \u2202p J, up to isotopy\non \u2202J, which is the oriented simple closed curve such that \u03bbp is null-homological in the\nDehn filling of J along \u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr , and that the orientation induced by (\u03bbp , \u03bcp ) coincides\nwith that of \u2202p J.\nWe say a node is geometric if J is either Seifert fibered or hyperbolic. More specifically,\nwe say key-chain nodes, torus-knot nodes, cable nodes and hyperbolic nodes, according to\ntheir defining KGLs. The first three families are also called Seifert fibered nodes.\nNow Theorem 5.4 may be rephrased as follows.\nProposition 5.6. Every nontrivial knot complement M is completely characterized by the\n~ and (ii) the assignment of the vertices of \u039b\n~ to\nfollowing data: (i) the rooted JSJ tree \u039b;\ncompatible geometric nodes, each of which is either a key-chain node, or a torus-knot\nnode, or a cable node, or a hyperbolic node.\nProvided Proposition 5.6, in order to prove Theorem 1.1, we must bound the number\nof allowable isomorphism types of the rooted JSJ tree and the number of allowable node\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n23\n\ntypes, under the assumption that G maps onto the fundamental group of the knot complement M. This amounts to bounding the number of JSJ pieces, the homeomorphism types\nof the JSJ pieces, as well as the number of allowable assignments of children longitudes.\n6. Isomorphism types of the rooted JSJ tree\nWe start to prove Theorem 1.1 in this section. Suppose G is a finitely presented group\nwith b1 (G) = 1, and M is a nontrivial knot complement such that there is an epimorphism\n\u03c6 : G \u0589 \u03c01 (M). In this section, we show that there are at most finitely many allowable\nisomorphism types of the rooted JSJ trees of M. In Section 7, we shall show that there\nare at most finitely many homeomorphism types of geometric pieces that are allowed to\nbe a geometric piece of M. In Section 8, we shall show that there are at most finitely\nmany allowable assignments of children longitudes for any such piece to make it a node\ndecorating the rooted JSJ tree of M. By Proposition 5.6, this will complete the proof of\nTheorem 1.1.\nLemma 6.1. Suppose G is a finitely generated group of rank n, and M is a knot complement\nsuch that G maps onto \u03c01 (M). Then M has at most 4n \u2212 3 pieces in its JSJ decomposition.\nHence there are at most finitely many allowable isomorphism types of rooted JSJ trees.\nProof. The upper-bound of the number of geometric pieces is a quick consequence from\na theorem of Richard Weidmann. In [27, Theorem 2], he proved that if G is a non-cyclic\nfreely-indecomposable n-generated group with a minimal k-acylindrical action on a simplicial tree, then the graph-of-groups decomposition induced by the action has at most\n1 + 2k(n \u2212 1) vertices. Recall that for a group G, a G-action on a simplicial tree T is called\nminimal if there is no proper subtree which is G-invariant, and is called k-acylindrical if no\nnontrivial element of G fixes a segment of length > k.\nNote there is a \u03c01 (M)-action on the Bass-Serre tree T associated to the JSJ decomposition of M. Precisely, T is the simplicial tree constructed as follows. Let M\u0303 be the universal\ncovering of M, then the preimage of any geometric piece is a collection of component. A\nvertex of T is a component of a geometric piece of M; two vertices are joined by an edge\nif and only if they are adjacent to each other. By specifying a base-point of M, there is\na natural \u03c01 (M)-action on T induced by the covering transformation. Because there is no\ngeometric piece homeomorphic to the nontrivial S 1 -bundle over a M\u00f6bius strip as M is a\nknot complement, it is known that \u03c01 (M)-action on T is minimal and 2-acylindrical, cf.\n[3, p. 298]. Therefore, the induced \u03c6(G)-action on T is also minimal and 2-acylindrical.\nSince \u03c6(G) is finitely generated as is G, we may apply Weidmann's theorem to obtain an\nupper-bound of the number of geometric pieces by 1 + 4(n \u2212 1) = 4n \u2212 3, where n is the\nrank of G.\nThe 'hence' part follows since there are only finitely many isomorphism types of rooted\ntrees with at most 4n \u2212 3 vertices.\n\u0003\n7. Homeomorphism types of geometric pieces\nIn this section, we show there are at most finitely many allowable homeomorphism types\nof geometric pieces under the assumption of Theorem 1.1. We consider the hyperbolic case\nand the Seifert fibered case in Subsections 7.1 and 7.2, respectively.\n7.1. Homeomorphism types of hyperbolic pieces. In this subsection, we show there are\nat most finitely many allowable homeomorphism types of hyperbolic pieces:\n\n\f24\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nProposition 7.1. Let G be a finitely presented group with b1 (G) = 1, then there are at most\nfinitely homeomorphism types of hyperbolic pieces J such that J is a hyperbolic piece of\nsome knot complement M such that G maps onto \u03c01 (M).\nWe prove Proposition 7.1 in the rest of this subsection.\nLet K be a finite 2-complex K of a presentation P of G achieving l(G). To argue by\ncontradiction, suppose G maps onto infinitely many knot groups \u03c01 (Mn ) such that there\nare infinitely many homeomorphically distinct hyperbolic pieces showing up. By Theorem\n4.1, Vol(Mn ) \u2264 \u03c0l(G). The J\u00f8rgensen-Thurston theorem ([26, Theorem 5.12.1]) implies\ninfinitely many of these pieces are distinct hyperbolic Dehn fillings of some hyperbolic\n3-manifold of finite volume. In particular, for any \u03b4 > 0 infinitely many of these pieces\ncontain closed geodesics of length < \u03b4. Let M be a knot complement with a hyperbolic\npiece J containing a sufficiently short closed geodesic \u03b3 so that Theorem 3.2 holds. By\nassumption, there is a \u03c01 -surjective map f : K \u2192 M. By Theorem 3.2, it factorizes through\nthe extended Dehn filling ie : N e \u2192 M of some denominator m > 0, up to homotopy,\nnamely f \u2243 ie \u25e6 f e , where f e : K \u2192 N e . Remember N = M \u2212 \u03b3 and N e = N \u222a Z.\nNote that b1 (K) = 1 and b1 (N e ) = 2, so f e is not \u03c01 -surjective. We consider the covering\nspace \u03ba : \u00d1 e \u2192 N e corresponding to Im(\u03c01 ( f e )), after choosing some base-points.\nLet T be union of the JSJ tori of N e . Note T is the union of the JSJ tori of M together\nwith the drilling boundary \u2202\u03b3 N, and the ridge piece Z of N e is only adjacent to the hyperbolic piece Y = J \u2212 \u03b3. By Proposition 2.6, there is an aspherical Scott core C of \u00d1 e\nsuch that C \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 (T ) are essential annuli and/or tori. Moreover, because b1 (G) = 1 implies\nb1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1, by Lemma 2.8, C contains no contractible chunk or non-central elementary\nchunk, in particular, no elementary hyperbolic chunk. Also, b0 (C) = 1, b3 (C) = 0 and\n\u03c7(C) \u2264 0 (since each chunk of C has \u03c7 \u2264 0, and the chunks are glued along tori and annuli\nby Lemma 2.8). Therefore, since b1 (C) = 1, we also have b2 (C) = 0 and \u03c7(C) = 0.\nHowever, there must be some hyperbolic chunk Q covering Y, because otherwise \u03ba| :\nC \u2192 N e would miss the interior of Y up to homotopy, so would map into Z or N \u2212 Y.\nEither case contradicts f : K \u2192 M being \u03c01 -surjective by the Van Kampen theorem. Thus\nQ is a non-elementary hyperbolic chunk of C.\nSuppose Im(\u03c01 (Q) \u2192 \u03c01 (Y)) has finite index in \u03c01 (Y). Then there is a torus boundary\ncomponent T\u0303 \u2282 \u2202Q \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 (T ) which is adjacent to a ridge piece. If so, then T\u0303 covers the\nside torus T = \u2202\u03b3 Y \u2282 N e . Since 0 , [T ] \u2282 H2 (N e ; Q), we conclude that 0 , [T\u0303 ] \u2208\nH2 (C; Q). Thus, b2 (C) > 0, which gives a contradiction.\nWe conclude \u03c01 (Q) is isomorphic to a non-elementary Kleinian group with infinite covolume, so \u03c7(Q) < 0. Note C is cut along tori/annuli into non-contractible chunks with\nnonpositive Euler characteristics. We conclude \u03c7(\u00d1 e ) = \u03c7(C) \u2264 \u03c7(Q) < 0, a contradiction.\n7.2. Homeomorphism types of Seifert fibered pieces. In this subsection, we show there\nare at most finitely many homeomorphism types of Seifert fibered pieces.\nProposition 7.2. Let G be a finitely presented group with b1 (G) = 1. Then there are at\nmost finitely many homeomorphism types of Seifert fibered pieces J such that J is a Seifert\nfibered piece of some knot complement M such that G maps onto \u03c01 (M). In fact, there are\nat most finitely many allowable values of q for a p/q-cable piece, where p , 0, q > 1 and\np, q are coprime integers, and there are at most finitely many allowable values of p, q for\na p/q-torus-knot piece, where |p| > 1, q > 1 and p, q are coprime integers.\nWe prove Proposition 7.2 in the rest of this subsection.\nWe first explain why the 'in fact' part implies the first statement. Remember from\nSection 5 that there are only three families of Seifert fibered pieces that could be a JSJ\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n25\n\npiece of a nontrivial knot complement, namely the key-chain link complements, cable-link\ncomplements, and torus-knot complements, (cf. Example 5.3). For an (r + 1)-component\nkey-chain link, the homeomorphism type of its complement is determined by r, indeed,\nit is homeomorphic to F0,r+1 \u00d7 S 1 where F0,r+1 is S 2 with (r + 1) open disks removed.\nThus the allowed values of r are bounded by the number of JSJ pieces of M, which is\nbounded in terms of G by Lemma 6.1. For a p/q-cable-link, the homeomorphism type of its\ncomplement is determined by q together with the residual class of p mod q, (possibly with\nsome redundancy). For a p/q-torus knot, the homeomorphism type of its complement is\ndetermined by the value p/q \u2208 Q, (possibly with some redudancy). Therefore, the 'in fact'\npart and Lemma 6.1 implies that there are at most finitely many allowable homeomorphism\ntypes of Seifert fibered pieces.\nIt now suffices to prove the 'in fact' part. The arguments for the p/q-cable case and\nthe p/q-torus-knot case are essentially the same, but we treat them as two cases for convenience.\n\nCase 1. Homeomorphism types of cable pieces.\nLet K be a finite 2-complex K of a presentation P of G achieving l(G). To argue by\ncontradiction, suppose G maps onto infinitely many knot groups \u03c01 (Mn ) such that there are\ninfinitely many homeomorphically distinct pn /qn -cable pieces Jn \u2282 Mn arising. Then for\ninfinitely many n, qn > 1 are sufficiently large. Let M = Mn be such a knot complement,\nq = qn , J = Jn , and f : K \u2192 M be a \u03c01 -surjective map as assumed. By Theorem 3.6, f\nfactors through the extended Dehn filling f e : K \u2192 N e of some denominator m \u2264 T (l(G))\nup to homotopy, where N = M \u2212 \u03b3 is the drilling along the corresponding exceptional fiber\n\u03b3 \u2282 J with boundary T , and N e = N \u222aT Z is the Dehn extension.\nConsider the covering space \u03ba : \u00d1 e \u2192 N e corresponding to Im(\u03c01 ( f e )), after choosing\nsome base-points. Then there is a homotopy lift f \u0303e : K \u2192 \u00d1 e , such that f \u0303e is \u03c01 -surjective\nand f e \u2243 \u03ba \u25e6 f \u0303e . Therefore b1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1 by the assumption b1 (K) = 1.\nWe wish to show, however, b1 (\u00d1 e ) > 1 in order to reach a contradiction.\nLet T be the union of the JSJ tori of N e . Let Y = J \u2212 \u03b3 be the regular cable piece of N e ,\nand let Z be the ridge piece of N e adjacent to Y. By Proposition 2.6, there is an aspherical\nScott core C of \u00d1 e such that CT = C \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 (T ) are essential annuli and/or tori. Moreover,\nbecause b1 (G) = 1 implies b1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1, by Lemma 2.8 C has no contractible chunk and no\nnon-central elementary chunk, in particular, no Seifert fibered chunk which is an I-bundle\nover an annulus. Also, b0 (C) = 1, b3 (C) = 0 and \u03c7(C) = 0. Therefore, since b1 (C) = 1, we\nalso have b2 (C) = 0.\nNote Y is homeomorphic to a trivial S 1 -bundle over a pair of pants \u03a3, and \u2202Y consists\nof three components, namely, the parent boundary \u2202p Y (the 'pattern boundary'), the child\nboundary \u2202c Y (the 'companion boundary'), and the drilling boundary T = \u2202\u03b3 Y. We also\nwrite \u2202\u03a3 = \u2202p \u03a3\u2294\u2202c \u03a3\u2294\u2202\u03b3 \u03a3 correspondingly. Let \u1ef8 be a component of \u03ba\u22121 (Y) and Q = C\u2229 \u1ef8\nbe a cable chunk. Then \u1ef8 is homeomorphic to either a trivial S 1 -bundle or a trivial Rbundle over a finitely generated covering \u03ba\u0304 : \u03a3\u0303 \u2192 \u03a3, and Q is homeomorphic to either\na trivial S 1 -bundle or a trivial I-bundle over a Scott core W of \u03a3\u0303, which is an orientable\ncompact surface. Moreover, the cut boundary \u2202T Q = Q\u2229\u03ba\u22121 (T ) \u2282 \u2202Q is a union of annuli\nand/or tori. It is a sub-bundle over a corresponding union of arcs and/or loops \u2202T W \u2282 \u2202W,\nand can be decomposed as a disjoint union\n\u2202p Q \u2294 \u2202c Q \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 Q,\n\n\f26\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\naccording to the image under \u03ba| : \u2202Q \u2192 \u2202Y. We also write \u2202T W = \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202c W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W\ncorrespondingly. We will use the same notation for a Seifert fibered chunk which is not Y,\nexcept that \u2202\u03b3 will be empty in such a case, and W may be an orbifold instead of a surface.\nThe following lemma rules out the case that Q is an I-bundle. Remembering that there\nis no disk component in CT by Lemma 2.8, the lemma below says any component of CT\nis a torus unless it is adjacent to a ridge chunk.\nLemma 7.3. If A is an annulus component of CT , then A is adjacent to a ridge chunk, and\nits core is a fiber in Q.\nProof. Suppose A were adjacent to regular chunks on both sides. If A is adjacent to a\nhyperbolic chunk Q, then by the argument of Proposition 7.1, \u03c7(Q) < 0, and hence \u03c7(C) <\n0, so b1 (C) > 1, a contradiction. If A is adjacent to Seifert fibered chunks on both sides,\nthen the core loop of A can only cover a fiber in one of the corresponding pieces of N\nunder \u03ba. Then the other chunk must be a Seifert fibered chunk which is an I-bundle over\nan orientable compact surface W. Then \u2202T W cannot be arcs of \u2202W as \u2202T Q has no disk\ncomponent. Hence \u2202T W are a few components of \u2202W. Note W is a compact orientable\nsurface, which cannot be a disk since Q is not contractible. If \u03c7(W) = 0, W is an annulus,\nso Q is an I-bundle over an annulus, which has been ruled out by our simplification of the\nScott core C, (Lemma 2.8). We conclude \u03c7(W) < 0. Note C is cut into chunks along annuli\nand tori, \u03c7(C) \u2264 \u03c7(Q) = \u03c7(W) < 0, so in this case b1 (\u00d1 e ) = b1 (C) > 1. This contradicts\nb1 (C) = 1.\nIf the core of A is not a fiber in the cable chunk Q, then again we conclude that \u03c7(Q) < 0,\na contradiction.\n\u0003\nThus we may assume that every Seifert fibered chunk is an S 1 -bundle over an orientable\ncompact surface orbifold.\nLemma 7.4. There is no torus T\u0303 of CT \u2282 C adjacent to a ridge chunk.\n\nProof. If so, then T\u0303 covers the side torus T = \u2202\u03b3 Y \u2282 N e . Since 0 , [T ] \u2282 H2 (N e ; Q), we\nconclude that 0 , [T\u0303 ] \u2208 H2 (C; Q). Thus, b2 (C) > 0, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma rules out non-separating components of CT .\nLemma 7.5. Any component of CT is separating in C.\nProof. To argue by contradiction, suppose there were some non-separating component of\nCT . Remember CT induces a graph-of-spaces decomposition of C over a finite connected\nsimplicial graph \u039b. Because b1 (C) = 1 and there is a non-separating edge, it is clear that\nthe graph \u039b has a unique embedded loop. Let C \u03c3 \u2282 C be the union of the chunk over\nthe embedded loop together with maximal regular chunks that are adjacent to this chunk\nat its regular subchunks, and let \u03c3 \u2282 \u039b be the underlying subgraph of C \u03c3 . Remember we\ndo not regard ridge subchunks which are homeomorphic to a 3-manifold as regular, and\nhence regular subchunks are all orientable. Thus the vertices of \u03c3 corresponding to ridge\nsubchunks all lie on the embedded loop with valence 2 in \u03c3.\nConsider the compact 3-manifold \u0108 \u03c3 obtained by replacing every ridge subchunk S \u2282\n\u03c3\nC by a thickened annulus A2 \u00d7 [0, 1]. This is possible because the ridge piece has easily\nunderstood coverings. There is a natural 'resolution' map:\n\u033a : \u0108 \u03c3 \u2192 C \u03c3 ,\n\nsuch that A2 \u00d7 { 21 } covers the ridge of S , and \u033a induces an isomorphism on the rational\nhomology. In particular, H1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ; Q) \u001b H1 (C \u03c3 ; Q). Note that \u0108 \u03c3 may be non-orientable, but\n\u0108 \u03c3 cut along any non-separating component of CT is always orientable.\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n27\n\nHowever, we claim b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 1, and hence b1 (C \u03c3 ) > 1. To see this, first note that \u0108 \u03c3\nis irreducible, and has no sphere boundary components by Lemma 2.7. Thus, \u03c7(\u0108 \u03c3 ) \u2264\n0. Suppose some non-separating component of CT is a torus T . Then T \u2282 C \u03c3 , and\ncorrespondingly T lies in the interior of \u0108 \u03c3 . However, \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 must be non-empty, since\notherwise any maximal regular subchunk R of C \u03c3 would only have tori boundary which\ncovers \u2202\u03b3 N under \u03ba, but this is clearly impossible as there is another component \u2202M \u2282 \u2202N.\nThus, b3 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) = 0. Also, 0 , [T ] \u2208 H2 (\u0108 \u03c3 ; Q) since T is 2-sided, orientable, and nonseparating, so b2 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) \u2265 1. Thus, 0 \u2265 \u03c7(\u0108 \u03c3 ) = b0 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) \u2212 b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) + b2 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) \u2265 2 \u2212 b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ),\nwhich implies b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 1.\nNow suppose every non-separating component of CT is an annulus. If A is such an\nannulus, then it must be adjacent to a ridge subchunk S \u2282 C \u03c3 by Lemma 7.3, so A is\nalso a component of \u2202\u03b3 Q for the cable subchunk Q \u2282 C \u03c3 adjacent to S along A. As \u2202\u03b3 Q\nis a trivial S 1 -bundle over \u2202\u03b3 W, where W is the compact orientable surface as described\nbefore, the core loop \u03be of A covers an ordinary fiber in Y under \u03ba, so \u03be is sent to a cover of\nan ordinary fiber of the cable piece J \u2282 M under the composition:\n\u033a\n\n\u2282\n\n\u03ba\n\nie\n\n\u0108 \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 C \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 \u00d1 e \u2212\u2192 N e \u2212\u2192 M.\nNote \u2202A \u2282 \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 , and A is 2-sided. If \u03c7(\u0108 \u03c3 ) < 0, as before we conclude that b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 1,\nso we may assume that \u03c7(\u2202\u0108 \u03c3 ) = 2\u03c7(\u0108 \u03c3 ) = 0. If a component of \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 containing a\ncomponent of \u2202A is a Klein bottle, then the fiber \u03be either lies in the boundary of a M\u00f6bius\nstrip, or is freely homotopic to its orientation-reversal. The former case is impossible\nbecause otherwise \u0108 \u03c3 \u2212 A would have at least one non-orientable boundary component, no\nmatter the components of \u2202A lie on 1 or 2 boundary components of \u0108 \u03c3 , which contradicts\n\u0108 \u03c3 \u2212 A being orientable; the latter case is impossible because \u03be covers an ordinary fiber of\na cable piece of M, which cannot be freely homotopic to the orientation-reversal due to the\n2-acylindricity of the JSJ decomposition of M, cf. [3, p. 298]. Thus \u2202A lies in (possibly the\nsame) tori components of \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 . If \u0108 \u03c3 is non-orientable with a torus boundary component,\nthen b2 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 0 from the exact sequence:\n0 = H3 (\u0108 \u03c3 , T 2 ; Q) \u2192 H2 (T 2 ; Q) \u2192 H2 (\u0108 \u03c3 ; Q),\nso b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 1. So we may assume that \u0108 \u03c3 is orientable. First suppose \u2202A lies on a single\ncomponent of \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 . In this case, \u2202A must be separating in \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 , because otherwise the\nunion of A and a component of \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 \u2212 \u2202A would be a Klein bottle, thus each component of\n\u2202A with the induced orientation would be freely homotopic to its orientation-reversal via\nthe Klein bottle, but this is impossible since the components of \u2202A cover ordinary fibers\nin Y \u2282 M, which cannot be freely homotopic to their orientation-reversal in M as before.\nTherefore, the union of A and a component of \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 \u2212 \u2202A is parallel to a non-separating\n2-sided torus in the interior of \u0108 \u03c3 , which implies b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 1 as before. Now suppose \u2202A\nlies on two different components of \u2202\u0108 \u03c3 , then b1 (\u0108 \u03c3 ) > 1 as \u0108 \u03c3 is orientable with at least\ntwo tori boundary components. This proves the claim.\nTo finish the proof of this lemma, we successively add adjacent chunks to C \u03c3 . Let C \u2032\nbe the union of C \u03c3 with all the adjacent ridge chunks, then H1 (C \u2032 ; Q) \u001b H1 (C \u03c3 ; Q) so\nb1 (C \u2032 ) > 1. For any maximal regular chunk R \u2282 C adjacent to C \u2032 , they are adjacent along\na side annulus of a ridge chunk S \u2282 C \u2032 . If they are adjacent along an annulus A, \u2202R is\nnon-empty, so b1 (R \u222a C \u2032 ) \u2265 b1 (R) + b1 (C \u2032 ) \u2212 b1 (A) \u2265 1 + 2 \u2212 1 = 2. Thus, let C \u2032\u2032 be\nthe union of C \u2032 with all the adjacent maximal regular chunks, b1 (C \u2032\u2032 ) > 1. Continuing in\nthis fashion by induction, we see b1 (C) > 1. This is a contradiction since we have said\nb1 (C) = 1.\n\u0003\n\n\f28\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nThe last part of the proof of Lemma 7.5 is a useful argument, so we extract it as below.\nLemma 7.6. In Case 1, assume all the components of CT are separating. If C \u2032 \u2282 C is a\nchunk with b1 (C \u2032 ) > 1, and all chunks adjacent to C \u2032 are ridge chunks, then b1 (C) > 1.\nProof. Similar to the last paragraph in the proof of Lemma 7.5, successively enlarge C \u2032 by\nattaching all the adjacent ridge chunks, and then all the adjacent maximal regular chunks,\nand continue alternately in this fashion.\n\u0003\nLemmas 7.5 and 7.6 allow us to use Mayer-Vietoris arguments based on the homology\nof cable chunks. This is carried out in the lemma below. Remember we have assumed any\ncable chunk Q is a trivial S 1 -bundle over a compact orientable surface W.\nLemma 7.7. With notation as above, for any cable chunk Q \u2282 C, the base surface W is\nplanar, and \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W are arcs contained in a single component of \u2202W. Hence W is\nhomeomorphic to a regular neighborhood of the union of \u2202T W together with an embedded\nsimplicial tree of which each end-point lies on a distinct component of \u2202T W, connecting\nall the components of \u2202T W.\nProof. Suppose W were not planar, there is an embedded non-separating torus T \u2282 Q\nwhich is the sub-S 1-bundle over a non-separating simple closed curve of W. Let C \u2032 be\nthe maximal regular chunk containing W. First suppose \u2202T C \u2032 is empty, then C = C \u2032\nbut \u2202C is non-empty with no sphere component. Thus b1 (C) > 1 since it has non-empty\naspherical boundary and a non-separating embedded torus, contrary to b1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1. Now\nsuppose \u2202T C \u2032 is non-empty, for the same reason as above, b1 (C \u2032 ) > 1. By Lemmas 7.5,\n7.6, b1 (\u00d1 e ) = b1 (C) > 1, contrary to b1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1.\nTo see the second part, we first show \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W is contained in a single component of\n\u2202W. Suppose on the contrary that \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W meets at least 2 components of \u2202W, then\nb1 (Q) > 1 + k where k \u2265 0 is the number of torus components of \u2202c Q. Let R \u2282 C be\nany maximal regular chunk adjacent to Q that misses the interior of C \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 Y. Note if\nR is adjacent to Q along any torus component of \u2202p Q \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 Q, then R has some boundary\ncomponent other than this torus. Thus, let Q\u2032 be Q together with all such chunks. A MayerVietoris argument shows b1 (Q\u2032 ) > 1 + k\u2032 where k\u2032 is the number of torus components of\n\u2202c Q\u2032 . Continuing in this fashion, in the end, we have b1 (C \u2032 ) > 1, where C \u2032 \u2282 C is\nthe maximal regular chunk containing Q, which must have no torus components of \u2202cC \u2032 ,\n(indeed, \u2202pC \u2032 \u2294 \u2202cC \u2032 = \u2205). By Lemmas 7.5, 7.6, again we obtain a contradiction.\nNow we show \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W are disjoint arcs rather than a single loop. Otherwise there\nwould be two cases. If \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W = \u2202p W were a single loop, then \u2202p Q would contain a\ntorus mapping to the homologically non-trivial torus \u2202p Y. Thus b2 (C) > 0, a contradiction.\nIf \u2202p W \u2294 \u2202\u03b3 W = \u2202\u03b3 W were a single loop, then \u2202\u03b3 Q would contain a torus, contradicting\nLemma 7.4.\nThe 'hence' part is an immediate consequence from the first part.\n\u0003\nTo finish the proof of Case 1, we observe the lemma below. Remember J is a p/q-cable\npattern piece, where q > 1, and a priori M = Mp \u222a J \u222a Mc , where Mp and Mc are the\npattern component and the companion component of M \u2212 J, respectively. Recall m is the\ndenominator of the Dehn extension N e . Let q\u2032 = q/ gcd(q, m).\nLemma 7.8. In the current situation, M = J \u222a Mc , and the image of (ie \u25e6 \u03ba)\u2217 : H1 (\u00d1 e ) \u2192\nH1 (M) \u001b Z is contained in q\u2032 Z.\nProof. We first show M = J \u222a Mc , namely \u2202p J is parallel to \u2202M. Suppose this is not the\ncase, then let S = \u2202p J be the pattern boundary of J, then S \u2282 N e . Notice that 0 , [S ] \u2208\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n29\n\nH2 (N e ; Q). If \u03ba\u22121 (S ) = \u2205, then f : K \u2192 N misses S up to homotopy, and we conclude\nthat \u03c01 (K) g \u03c01 (M) unless J is the root of the JSJ tree. So \u03ba\u22121 (S ) is non-empty, and by\nLemma 7.3, each component S\u0303 of \u03ba\u22121 (S ) is a torus. But then 0 , [S\u0303 ] \u2208 H2 (\u00d1 e ; Q), since\n\u03ba| : H2 (S\u0303 ; Q) \u2192 H2 (S ; Q) is non-zero. This implies that b2 (\u00d1 e ) > 0, a contradiction.\nNext, we show the image of H1 (\u00d1 e ) \u2192 H1 (M) \u001b Z is contained in q\u2032 Z. It suffices to\nshow for H1 (C) \u2192 H1 (M) as C \u2282 \u00d1 e is a homotopy equivalence. Now C is the union of\ncable chunks, ridge chunks and regular Mc -chunks, namely the components of C\u2229\u03ba\u22121 (Mc ).\nBy the cabling construction of knots, the image of H1 (Mc ) \u2192 H1 (M) \u001b Z is contained in\nqZ, so every Mc -chunk maps into qZ on homology. Note the ordinary fiber of J also lies\nin qZ, by Lemma 7.7, every cable chunk also maps into qZ on homology. Note every ridge\nchunk is adjacent to at least one cable chunk, Lemma 7.7 implies any ridge chunk S is\nhomeomorphic to Mu \u00d7 I, where u : S 1 \u2192 S 1 is a finite cyclic cover (from an ordinary\nSeifert fiber in T ), and Mu is the mapping cylinder u. To bound the degree of u, we take a\nbasis for the homology of the torus H1 (T ) \u001b Z\u2295Z with meridian (1, 0) and longitude (0, 1).\nThen the fiber slope is (p, q). When we take the Dehn extension, we embed Z+Z \u2282 m1 Z+Z.\nLetting m\u2032 = gcd(m, q), we see that the maximal root of the fiber slope (p, q) in m1 Z + Z\nis (p/m\u2032 , q/m\u2032 ) = (p/m\u2032 , q\u2032 ). Thus, the degree of the map u must divide m\u2032 since Mu is a\ncore for a cyclic cover of the ridge chunk Z. This implies every ridge chunk maps into q\u2032 Z\non homology. Because C \u2229 \u03ba\u22121 (\u2202Y), where Y = J \u2212 \u03b3, has no non-separating component\nby Lemma 7.5, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence implies C maps into q\u2032 Z on homology. This\ncompletes the proof of the second part.\n\u0003\nWhen q > m, then q\u2032 > 1, so Lemma 7.8 gives a contradiction to the assumption that\nf : K \u2192 M is \u03c01 -surjective as f is homotopic to the composition:\nf \u0303e\n\n\u03ba\n\nie\n\nK \u2212\u2192 \u00d1 e \u2212\u2192 N e \u2212\u2192 M.\nThus, q \u2264 m \u2264 T (l(G)) by Thoerem 3.6. This completes the proof of Case 1.\nCase 2. Homeomorphism types of torus-knot pieces.\nWe'll use the same notation as the beginning of the proof of Case 1. In fact, the p/qtorus-knot complement J is a Seifert fibered space over the base 2-orbifold S 2 (p, q, \u221e). If\nit is the q-exceptional fiber \u03b3 (i.e. the fiber over the cone point correpsonding to q) that has\nbeen drilled out for the Dehn extension, let N e = N \u222aT Z as in Case 1. Let S = \u2202p J be\nthe pattern boundary of J, then S \u2282 N e . Notice that 0 , [S ] \u2208 H2 (N e ; Q). If \u03ba\u22121 (S ) = \u2205,\nthen f : K \u2192 N misses S up to homotopy, and we conclude that \u03c01 (K) g \u03c01 (M) unless\nJ is the root of the JSJ tree. So \u03ba\u22121 (S ) is non-empty, and by Lemma 7.3, each component\nS\u0303 of \u03ba\u22121 (S ) is a torus. But then 0 , [S\u0303 ] \u2208 H2 (\u00d1 e ; Q), since \u03ba| : H2 (S\u0303 ; Q) \u2192 H2 (S ; Q) is\nnon-zero. This implies that b2 (\u00d1 e ) > 0, a contradiction.\nThe only possibility if J is the root of the JSJ tree of M is that J = M, i.e. M is a torus\nknot complement. In this case, we obtain a contradiction by showing that covers \u00d1 e \u2192 N e\nwith b1 (\u00d1 e ) = 1 are elementary as in the proof of Lemma 7.7.\nCases 1 and 2 together completes the proof of Proposition 7.2.\n8. Choices of parent meridians and children longitudes\nWe shall finish the proof of Theorem 1.1 in this section. Up to now, it remains to\nbound the allowable choices of children longitudes on an allowable JSJ piece. Provided\nPropositions 7.1, 7.2, this will bound the allowable isomorphism types of nodes.\n\n\f30\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nLemma 8.1. Let G be a finitely presented group with b1 (G) = 1. If J is an orientable compact 3-manifold homeomorphic to a hyperbolic piece of some knot complement M such that\nG maps onto \u03c01 (M), then there are at most finitely many choices of slopes \u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }\non \u2202J, depending only on G and J, so that (J, \u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }) is a hyperbolic node decorating a vertex of the rooted JSJ tree for some such M.\nProof. Up to finitely many choices, we may assume the children boundaries \u2202c1 J \u2294 * * * \u2294\n\u2202cr J and the parent boundary \u2202p J are assigned, (cf. the remark of Definition 5.5). Let K be\na finite presentation 2-complex of G as before. We need only show that there are finitely\nmany possible choices for the children longitudes, since for each such choice, there are\nonly finitely many possible parent meridian choices.\nTo argue by contradiction, suppose there are infinitely many \u03c01 -surjective maps fn :\nK \u2192 Mn such that J is a hyperbolic piece of a knot complement Mn with the children\nand parent boundaries compatible with the rooted JSJ tree of Mn , and that the sets of\nchildren longitudes {\u03bbc1 ,n , * * * , \u03bbcr ,n } are distinct up to isotopy on \u2202J for different n's. After\npassing to a subsequence and re-indexing the children boundaries if necessary, we may\nassume that \u03bbc1 ,n \u2282 \u2202c1 J are distinct slopes for different n's, without loss of generality .\nFor every n, we may write Mn = Mp,n \u222a J \u222a Mc1 ,n \u222a * * * \u222a Mcr ,n , where Mp,n and Mci ,n 's\nare the components of Mn \u2212 J adjacent to J along \u2202p J and \u2202ci J's, respectively. (Mp,n\nis possibly empty if \u2202p J equals \u2202Mn ). Let Jn\u2032 be the Dehn filling of J along \u03bbc1 ,n , and\nMn\u2032 = Mp,n \u222a Jn\u2032 \u222a Mc2 ,n \u222a * * * \u222a Mcr ,n . Then Mn\u2032 is still a knot complement and there is a\n'de-satellitation' map:\n\u03b1n : Mn \u2192 Mn\u2032 ,\nnamely, such that \u03b1n | : Mc1 ,n \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 D2 \u001b Jn\u2032 \u2212 J is the degree-one map induced by the\nabelianization \u03c01 (Mc1 ,n ) \u2192 Z, and that \u03b1n is the identity restricted to the rest of Mn . Since\n\u03b1n is degree-one and hence \u03c01 -surjective, fn\u2032 = \u03b1n \u25e6 fn : K \u2192 Mn\u2032 is \u03c01 -surjective for any n.\nHowever, by the J\u00f8rgensen-Thurston theorem on hyperbolic Dehn fillings ([26, Theorem\n5.12.1]), for all but finitely many slopes \u03bbc1 ,n , Jn\u2032 are hyperbolic and mutually distinct. Thus\nJn\u2032 's are homeomorphically distinct hyperbolic pieces of Mn\u2032 's, but this contradicts Proposition 7.1 that there are only finitely many allowable homeomorphism types of hyperbolic\npieces.\n\u0003\nLemma 8.2. Let G be a finitely presented group with b1 (G) = 1. If J is an orientable\ncompact 3-manifold homeomorphic to a Seifert fibered piece of some knot complement\nM such that G maps onto \u03c01 (M), then there are at most finitely many choices of slopes\n\u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr } on \u2202J, depending only on G and J, so that (J, \u03bcp , {\u03bbc1 , * * * , \u03bbcr }) is a\nSeifert fibered node decorating a vertex of the rooted JSJ tree for some such M.\nProof. Among the three possible families of Seifert fibered nodes (cf. Proposition 5.6), the\nchoice of children longitude is uniquely determined up to orientation for key-chain nodes,\nand there is no children longitude for a torus-knot node. It remains to bound the allowable\nchoices of children longitudes for an allowable cable piece. As before, there will be only\nfinitely many possible choices of parent meridians for a give choice of children longitudes.\nNote the homeomorphism type of a p/q-cable piece (p, q coprime, q > 1) is determined by\nq and the residual class of p mod q, and the children longitude is determined by the integer\np provided q. Thus it suffices to bound the allowable values of p as the allowable values of\nq are already bounded by Proposition 7.2.\nTo see this, let G is a finitely presented group with b1 (G) = 1, represented by a finite\npresentation 2-complex K. Let J be an orientable compact 3-manifold homeomorphic to\na cable piece of some knot complement M as assumed. There is a unique choice of the\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n31\n\nparent (i.e. pattern) component and the child (i.e. companion) component, \u2202J = \u2202c J \u2294 \u2202p J.\nLet M = Mp \u222a J \u222a Mc where Mp , Mc are the components of M \u2212 J adjacent to J along \u2202p J,\n\u2202c J, respectively. If J is realized as a p/q-cable in M, let \u03bbc \u2282 \u2202c J be the child longitude\nrealized in M, and J \u2032 be the Dehn filling of J along \u03bbc , and M \u2032 = Mp \u222a J \u2032 . Then M \u2032 is still\na knot complement and there is a 'de-satellitation' map:\n\u03b1 : M \u2192 M\u2032 ,\n\ninduced by the abelianization \u03c01 (Mc ) \u2192 Z. Because \u03b1 is degree-one and hence \u03c01 surjective, f \u2032 = \u03b1 \u25e6 f : K \u2192 M \u2032 is also \u03c01 -surjective. However, now J \u2032 is a p/q-torusknot complement, so there are at most finitely many allowable values of p by Proposition\n7.2.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.1. First, we reduce from the case that G is a finitely generated group\nwith b1 (G) = 1 to the case that G is finitely presented. For any presentation P = (x1 , . . . , xn ; r1 , . . . , rm , . . .)\nof G, we may choose a finite collection of relators {r1 , . . . , rk } such that the group G\u2032 =\nhx1 , . . . , xn ; r1 , . . . , rk i has b1 (G\u2032 ) = 1. If G\u2032 has only finitely many homomorphisms to\nknot groups, then so does G, since we have an epimorphism G\u2032 \u2192 G. We thank Jack\nButton for pointing out this observation to us. Thus, we may assume that G is finitely\npresented.\nBy Lemma 6.1, there are at most finitely many allowable isomorphism types of the\nrooted JSJ tree of M (Definition 5.1) under the assumption in the statement. By Propositions 7.1, 7.2, there are at most finitely many allowable homeomorphism types of JSJ\npieces, and by Lemmas 8.1, 8.2, each of them allows at most finitely many choices of\nchildren longitudes and parent meridian. Hence there are at most finitely many allowable\nisomorphism types of compatible geometric nodes. By Proposition 5.6, we conclude that\nthere are at most finitely many allowable homeomorphisms types of knot complements M\nas assumed.\n\u0003\n9. A diameter bound for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds\nIn this section, we generalize and improve the diameter bound for closed hyperbolic\n3-manifolds obtained in [28].\nTheorem 9.1. There exists a universal constant C > 0, such that for any orientable closed\nhyperbolic 3-manifold M, the following statements are true.\n(1) The diameter of M is bounded by C l(G) for any finitely presented group G with b1 (G) =\n0 if G maps onto \u03c01 (M).\n(2) The diameter of M is also bounded by C l(G) for G = \u03c01 (M).\nProof. (1) Let \u01eb = \u01eb3 > 0 be the Margulis constant of H3 . Let M = M\u01eb \u222a V1 \u222a * * * \u222a V s\nwhere M\u01eb is the \u01eb-thick part, and Vi 's are the components of the \u01eb-thin parts, which are\nhomeomorphic to solid tori.\nTo bound the diameter of M\u01eb , pick a maximal collection of pairwise disjoint balls of\nradii 2\u01eb . Then the centers of the balls form an \u01eb-net of M\u01eb . In particular, diam(M\u01eb ) is\nbounded by 2\u01eb times the number of balls. On the other hand, writing \u03c9 for \u03c0(sinh(\u01eb)\u2212\u01eb), i.e.\n\u01eb)\n\u2264 Vol(M)\nthe volume of a hyperbolic ball of radius 2\u01eb , the number of balls is at most Vol(M\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 ,\n\u03c0l(G)\nwhich is bounded by \u03c9 by Theorem 4.1. We have:\ndiam(M\u01eb ) \u2264\nwhere C1 =\n\n2\u03c0\u01eb\n\u03c9 .\n\n2\u03c0\u01ebl(G)\n= C1 l(G),\n\u03c9\n\n\f32\n\nIAN AGOL AND YI LIU\n\nTo bound the diameter of the thin tubes, let V = Vi be a component. The core loop of\nV is a simple closed geodesic \u03b3. If the length of \u03b3 were so short that the tube radius of\nV satisfies \u03c0 sinh2 (r) > A(l(G)), where A(n) = 27n (9n2 + 4n)\u03c0, (cf. Lemma 3.4), then by\nTheorem 3.2, the assumed epimorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 \u03c01 (M) would factorize through some\nextended drilling \u03c01 (N e ) where N = M \u2212 \u03b3, as \u03c6 = \u03b9e \u25e6 \u03c6e , where \u03b9e : \u03c01 (N e ) \u2192 M\nis the extended Dehn filling epimorphism and \u03c6e : G \u2192 \u03c01 (N e ). Consider the covering\n\u03ba : \u00d1 e \u2192 N e corresponding to Im(\u03c6e ), and an argument similar to Proposition 7.1 would\ngive a contradiction. Note assuming b1 (G) = 0 is necessary here since after drilling one\ncan only conclude b1 (N e ) > 0. Indeed, assuming b1 (G) = 1 would not work, for example,\nany one-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold maps \u03c01 -onto infinitely many Dehn fillings whose\ndiameters can be arbitrarily large. The contradiction implies the tube radius r satisfies:\np\nr \u2264 arcsinh 27l(G) (9l(G)2 + 4l(G))\np\nh\ni\n\u221a\n< ln (1 + 2) * 27l(G) (9l(G)2 + 4l(G))\n< C2 l(G),\n\nfor some constant C2 > 0. We have diam(V) < Length(\u03b3) + 2r < \u01eb + 2C2 l(G).\nCombining the bounds for the different parts, we have\ndiam(M) \u2264 diam(M\u01eb ) + 2 max diam(Vi ) < 2\u01eb + (C1 + 2C2 )l(G) < C l(G),\n1\u2264i\u2264s\n\nfor some sufficiently large universal constant C > 0.\n(2) The proof of (1) works for this situation after two modifications. First, in bounding\nthe diameter of the thick part, we use [7, Theorem 0.1] instead of Theorem 4.1 to conclude Vol(M) \u2264 \u03c0l(G). Secondly, in bounding the diameter of the thin tubes, after the\nfactorization \u03c6 = \u03b9e \u25e6 \u03c6e , we consider the sequence of homomorphisms:\n\u03c6\u0303e\n\n\u03ba\u266f\n\n\u03b9e\n\nG \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (\u00d1 e ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (N e ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M).\n\nThe composition is \u03c01 -isomorphic, so should that on H3 (\u2212; Q). Note H3 (G; Q) \u001b H3 (M; Q) \u001b\nQ, but H3 (N e ; Q) \u001b H3 (N; Q) = 0, cf. Subsection 2.2. This is a contradiction, which in\nturn implies the tube radius r satisfies \u03c0 sinh2 (r) \u2264 A(l(G)). The rest of the proof proceeds\nthe same way as in (1).\n\u0003\n10. Conclusion\nWe believe that some of the techniques in this paper may have applications to questions\nregarding homomorphisms from groups to 3-manifold groups.\nQuestion 10.1. For a finitely generated group G, is there a uniform description of all\nhomomorphisms from G to all 3-manifold groups?\nIf G is a free group of rank n, then this question is asking for a description of all 3manifolds which have a subgroup of rank n, which is probably too difficult to carry out\nin general. So to make progress on this question, one would likely have to make certain\nrestrictions on the group G, such as the hypothesis in this paper of b1 (G) = 1. The answer\nwill likely involve factorizations through Dehn extensions, and may be analogous to the\ntheory of limit groups and Makanin-Razborov diagrams [21].\nMore specifically, we ask for an effective version of Theorem 1.1:\nQuestion 10.2. For a finitely presented group G with b1 (G) = 1, is there an algorithmic\ndescription of all knot complements M for which there is an epimorphism G \u0589 \u03c01 (M),\nand for each such M, an algorithmic description of the epimorphisms?\n\n\fPRESENTATION LENGTH AND SIMON'S CONJECTURE\n\n33\n\nAs an aspect of Question 10.1, we ask:\nQuestion 10.3. If G is finitely generated (but infinitely presented), is there a finitely\npresented group \u011c and an epimorphism e : \u011c \u2192 G such that it induces a bijection\ne\u2217 : Hom(G, \u0393) \u2192 Hom(\u011c, \u0393), for every 3-manifold group \u0393 = \u03c01 (M)?\nThis is true if we restrict M to be hyperbolic.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 holds if we restrict M to be a hyperbolic knot complement in\na rational homology sphere. The place that we used that M is a knot complement in S 3 is\nin the JSJ decomposition in Section 7.2 and in bounding the companions in Section 8.\nQuestion 10.4. If G is finitely generated with b1 (G) = 1, are there only finitely many\nM a knot complement in a rational homology sphere for which there is an epimorphism\nG \u0589 \u03c01 (M)?\nReferences\n[1] Michel Boileau, Steve Boyer, Alan Reid, and Shicheng Wang, Simon's conjecture for 2-bridge knots, Communications in Analysis and Geometry 18 (2010), no. 1, 121\u2013143, arXiv:0903.2898.\n[2] Michel Boileau, Hyam Rubinstein, and Shicheng Wang, Finiteness of 3-manifolds associated with non-zero\ndegree mappings, preprint, 2005, math.GT/0511541.\n[3] Michel Boileau and Richard Weidmann, The structure of 3-manifolds with two-generated fundamental group,\nTopology 44 (2005), no. 2, 283\u2013320, math.GT/0111327.\n[4] Ryan Budney, JSJ-decompositions of knot and link complements in S 3 , Enseign.
