Introduction\nIn our previous article [1], we proposed a new set of symbols, the Probability Bracket\nNotation (PBN). We demonstrated that PBN could play a similar role for probability\ntheories [2] as Dirac Vector Bracket Notation (VBN) plays for Hilbert vector space.\nIn this article, we take advantage of the abstracting power of both PBN and VBN to\nexplore the relations between Hilbert space and sample space. We introduce base\nobservables (operators) for such spaces, and define the induced sample space from a\nHilbert space and the induced Hilbert space from a sample space. We propose that there\nexists equivalence between a Hilbert space and a sample space, if the two spaces are\nconstructed on the same base observable(s). This provides us with a freedom of mapping\nsystem states from one space to another, and enables us to apply different ways to handle\ntheir probability distribution functions (PDF).\nAs a case study of PBN, VBN and the equivalence proposition, we investigate transition\noperator of Markov chains [2-3] in diffusion maps [4-6] for data clustering. We use two\nexamples to show the procedure. First is a simple example from graph theory [7], which\nhas a symmetric transition matrix, so can be used to build a bidirectional transition\noperator. The second example is from the famous 3-text-document collection [9-10]. This\nnumerical example can serve as a tutorial of how to make diffusion map for text\ndocuments, and also provides a concrete evidence for the necessary condition of\nequivalence between a Hilbert space and a sample space.\nFinally, we apply the equivalence relation between phase space in Thermophysics and the\nHilbert space of a single particle or many-particle systems. We derive the wave function\nof a single particle of monatomic ideal gas in a square well at temperature T, and verify\nthe consistence of statistic formulas in PBN and in the Fock space of identical bosons or\nfermions.\n2. Induced Sample Space and Induced Hilbert Space\nDirac VBN has proved to be a very powerful tool to deal with states in Hilbert space. PBN\nmight offer a similarly powerful tool to deal with states in sample space. Together, they\nprovide a unified platform to investigate the relationship between the two spaces and\ntheir states.\nIn this section, with the help of both PBN and VBN, we show that how to build induced\nspace from each other. Starting from a Hilbert space and its base observable, we can\nconstruct an induced sample space, and there is a one-to-one equivalence between a\nsystem state in the Hilbert and a corresponding state in the induced sample space. We can\nalso construct an induced Hilbert space from a sample space and its base observable, and\nfor each sample system state, there exists an equivalent Hilbert state. The equivalence is\n\nDr. Xing M Wang\n\nPBN: Hilbert Markov Diffusion\n\nPage 2 of 25\n\n\f11/22/2009\ncritical for mapping states between Hilbert space, sample space and the space of\nprobability vectors.\n\n2.1. From Hilbert Space to Induced Sample Space\nDefinition 2.1.1 (Base Observables of Hilbert Space): If a Hilbert space \u0402 is spanned by\neigenvectors of a set of Hermitian operators {\u0124}, then the elements of {\u0124} are called the\nbase observables or base operators of the Hilbert space \u0402.\nDefinition 2.1.2 (Base Observables of Sample Space): If a sample space \u03a9 is based on\nthe outcomes of observing a set of random variables { X\u0302 }, the elements of { X\u0302 } are\ncalled the base observables or base operators of the sample space.\nLet us consider a Hilbert space in QM. We can build a v-basis from the complete set of\nnormalized eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator (e.g., the Hamiltonian \u0124 of the system):\nH\u02c6 | \uf079 i \uf0f1 \uf03d E n | \uf079 i \uf0f1 ,\n\nn\n\n\uf0e5|\uf079\ni \uf03d1\n\ni\n\n\uf0f1 \uf0e1\uf079 i | \uf03d I , \uf0e1\uf079 i | \uf079 j \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf064 ij\n\n(2.1.1)\n\nThese eigenvectors form a vector-basis. The state of the system now can be expanded as:\nn\n\nn\n\ni \uf03d1\n\ni \uf03d1\n\n| \uf059 \uf0f1 \uf03d I | \uf059 \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 | \uf079 i \uf0f1 \uf0e1\uf079 i | \uf059\uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 ci | \uf079 i \uf0f1\n\n(2.1.2)\n\nIts normalization requires:\n\uf0e1\uf059 | \uf059\uf0f1 \uf03d\n\nn\n\n\uf0e5 \uf0e1\uf079\n\ni, j\n\ni\n\n| c i * c j | \uf079 j \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 | ci | 2 \uf03d 1\ni\n\n(2.1.3)\n\nIt is well known in QM that the expectation value of \u0124 is:\nn\n\n\uf0e1 H\u02c6 \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e1 \uf059 | H\u02c6 | \uf059 \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 \uf0e1\uf079 i | ci * c j H\u02c6 | \uf079 j \uf0f1\ni, j\n\n\uf03d \uf0e5 \uf064 ij E j | c j | \uf03d \uf0e5 E j | c j |\n2\n\ni, j\n\n(2.1.4)\n2\n\nj\n\nHence, the probability of the system found in i-th state is determined by a Hilbert PDF:\n{ pi : pi \uf0ba | ci | 2 \uf03d| \uf0e1\uf079 i | \uf059\uf0f1 | 2 }\n\n(2.1.5)\n\nBy our definition, operator \u0124 is the base observable of the Hilbert space, with its v-basis\ndefined in (2.1.1). Each PDF represents one of its possible system states.\n\nDr. Xing M Wang\n\nPBN: Hilbert Markov Diffusion\n\nPage 3 of 25\n\n\f11/22/2009\nNow let us do one-to-one map from the v-basis to P-basis of a sample space \u03a9, which is a\nCMD (complete mutually disjoint) set:\nn\n\n\uf0e5 |\uf079 ) P(\uf079\ni\n\ni \uf03d1\n\ni\n\n| \uf03d I , P(\uf079 i |\uf079 j ) \uf03d \uf064 ij\n\n(2.1.6a)\n\nThe base observable \u00ca has its eigen-kets and eigen-bra as:\nn\n\nE\u02c6 \uf03d \uf0e5 | \uf079 i ) Ei P (\uf079 i |,\n\nE\u02c6 | \uf079 i ) \uf03d Ei | \uf079 i )\n\ni \uf03d1\n\n(2.1.6b)\n\nThen, applying Eq.

(2.2.3). This leads to our second proposition:\nProposition 2.2.1: Starting from a base observable set in sample space, we can build an\ninduced Hilbert space. The induced Hilbert space and the sample space are equivalent.\nFor any possible PDF in the sample space, there is an equivalent physical state in the\ninduced Hilbert space.\nUsing the induced Hilbert v-basis, as we did in \u00a74.1 of Ref. [1], we can map the state Pket (2.2.3) to a probability column vector (PCV):\n6\n6\n1\n\uf0e1i | \uf057\uf0f1 \uf03d 1/ 6, i \uf0ce {1, 2,...6}, | \uf057\uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 | i\uf0f1\uf0e1i | \uf057\uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 | i\uf0f1\n1\n1 6\n\n(2.2.10)\n\nNote: As we have discussed in Proposition 2.1.5 of Ref. [1], the state P-ket |\u03a9) presents a\nsystem state with its PDF, but the state P-bra (\u03a9| just represents the union of all possible\nevents.\n3. Markov Chains and Diffusion Maps\nMarkov chains [2-3] describe the time evolution of system states in a sample space. By\nnature, the sample space has a base observable set and the basis associated with the\nobservable. The sample system states are represented by probability vectors ([2], \u00a711.1).\nEach probability vector is a snapshot of the probability distribution function (PDF) at a\ngive time. The Markov transition matrix transforms PDF of current state to the PDF of\nnext time. If the transition matrix satisfies certain conditions, its eigenvectors form a\ncomplete basis of a Hilbert space, called the diffusion space [4-6]. Then one can map data\npoints in original sample space onto the diffusion space, with reduced dimension based\non the order of eigenvalues. In this section, we give two detailed numerical examples to\nillustrate the procedures.\n3.1. Time-Dependent Probability Vectors and Markov Chains\nWe assume our sample space has the following base observable with discrete P-basis:\nr\n\nX\u02c6 | j ) \uf03d j | j ) , P(i | j ) \uf03d \uf064 i j , \uf0e5 | i )P (i | \uf03d I\ni \uf03d1\n\n(3.1.1a)\n\nUsing the P-basis, we can build an induced Hilbert space as described in Eq.

As discussed in Ref. [4-6], since the eigenvalues in Eq. (3.3.2) have the order in\nEq.(3.2.4a), the more steps we have, the closer become the related points (data clustering)\nand the fewer upper components have significant contributions to the distance\n(dimensional reduction). The whole picture here may be viewed as follows.\n1. We define our initial Hilbert state vector as the linear combinations of the\neigenvectors with the uniform probabilities:\nn\nn\n1\n(3.3.7)\n| \uf059 ( 0) \uf0f1 \uf03d I | \uf059 ( 0) \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 | \uf079 i \uf0f1\uf0e1\uf079 i | \uf059 ( 0) \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5\n|\uf079 i \uf0f1\nn\ni \uf03d0\ni \uf03d1\n2. Use Markov transition operator to act on it t-times as in Eq. (3.2.17):\n\n1 \u02c6t\n1 t\nP\u02c6 t | \uf059 ( 0 ) \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5\nP | \uf079 i \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 \uf06ci | \uf079 i \uf0f1\nn\nn\ni\uf03d0\ni \uf03d0\n\n(3.3.8)\n\nBecause the eigenvalues have the values and order in Eq. (3.2.4a), so when t is big\nenough, only the upper most ones have significant contributions The first term is timedependent, and eventually will be the only significant term. To better describe the\ndocuments locations, we should remove it. If we have many eigenvectors with smaller\nabsolute eigenvalues (smaller than one), we can keep the top few vectors in order to\nreduce the dimension.\n3.4. Diffusion Map: a Text Document Example\nIn this section, we discuss diffusion map in text document space. We will follow the steps\nin Appendix B of Ref. [6], build transition matrix, find its left/right eigenvectors and\nmake diffusion map.\nExample 3.4.1 The SVD Right Matrix (see the Grossman-Frieder example in Ref [9],\nEq. (3.1.2) of Ref. [10], or [12]): The starting point is the document-term matrix A (see\n\u00a73.1, [10]):\n\n\uf0e9 \uf0e1 d1 | \uf0f9 \uf0e91 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\uf0f9\nA \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0e1 d 2 |\uf0fa\uf0fa \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0ea1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 1\uf0fa\uf0fa\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\uf0e1 d 3 |\uf0fa\uf0fb \uf0ea\uf0eb1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\uf0fa\uf0fb\nT\n\n(3.4.1a)\n\nThen the right (document-document) matrix R is calculated from A:\n\nDr. Xing M Wang\n\nPBN: Hilbert Markov Diffusion\n\nPage 14 of 25\n\n\f11/22/2009\n\n\uf0e9 \uf0e1 d1 | \uf0f9\n\uf0e97 3 5 \uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0fa\nR \uf03d A A \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0e1 d 2 |\uf0fa\uf05b| d1 \uf0f1 , |d 2 \uf0f1, | d 3 \uf0f1 \uf05d \uf03d \uf0ea\uf0ea3 10 5\uf0fa\uf0fa\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\uf0e1 d 3 |\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0ea\uf0eb5 5 7\uf0fa\uf0fb\nT\n\n(3.4.1b)\n\nWe will take this symmetric matrix R as the weight matrix w in Eq. (3.2.1a). We prefer\nthis matrix to the matrix Q(i, j) proposed in Ref. [5]:\n\uf0e6 N i, j\nQ(i, j ) \uf03d log\uf0e7 ~\n\uf0e7N N\n\uf0e8 i j\n\n\uf0ec N i , j : number of words j in document i\n\uf0f6\n~\n\uf0f7 \uf03d where \uf0ef\uf0ed N\ni : total number of words in document i\n\uf0f7\n\uf0ef N : total number of words j in all document\n\uf0f8\n\uf0ee j\n\n(3.4.2)\n\nThe reasons are:\n1. It is not clear how to construct the weight matrix w in Eq. (3.2.1a) from Q(i, j);\n2. It is not clear how to deal with the singular cases like Ni,j = 0.\n3. We want to compare diffusion map with SVD, based on document-term matrix A.\nThe sample space of this document space has a basis as in Eq. (3.1.1) with r = 3. Its base\nobservable is its document label, valued from 1 to 3:\nn\u02c6 | x) \uf03d x | x) , P( x | n\u02c6 | y ) \uf03d x\uf064 xy ,\n\n3\n\n\uf0e5 | x) P( x |\uf03d 1\n\n(3.4.3)\n\nx \uf03d1\n\nThe sample state P-ket in this sample space is:\n3\n\n3\n\nx \uf03d1\n\nx \uf03d1\n\n| \uf057 (t ) ) \uf03d \uf0e5 | x) P( x | \uf057(t ) ) \uf03d \uf0e5 m(t ) ( x) | x)\n\n(3.4.4)\n\nUsing symmetric matrix R as the weight matrix w in Eq. (3.2.1a), we can build a\nsymmetric matrix a (see Eq. (9) in Appendix B of [6]):\na ( x, y ) \uf03d\n\nd ( x)\np ( x, y ) \uf03d\nd ( y)\n\nw( x, y )\nd ( x) d ( y )\n\n\uf03d\n\nR xy\n\n(3.4.5)\n\n(\uf0e5 R xz )(\uf0e5 R yz )\nz\n\nz\n\nHere, the values of d(x) can be obtained from Eq. (3.2.1b) and (3.4.1b):\nd (1) \uf03d 15, d (2) \uf03d 18, d (3) \uf03d 17\n\n(3.4.6a)\n\nUsing Eq.

[10], we have evaluated their distances using a metric tensor based on the same\nSVD example, and, by using top two eigenvectors, we get the following results:\nd (1,2) \uf03d 1.4547, d (2,3) \uf03d 1.1638, d (1,3) \uf03d 0.5140\n\n(3.4.13a)\n\nThe documents appear to have the same order of distances in the two methods. This\nshould not be a surprise.

Both matrices\nare based on the same document-term frequency matrix A in Eq.

The transition operator P\u0302 is NOT an observable of the original document space, since,\naccording to Eq. (3.1.8), it does not commute with the base observable X\u0302 :\n\nP\u02c6 | x\uf0f1 \uf03d\n\nn\n\n\uf0e5 | x ' \uf0f1P\n\nx'y'\n\nx ', y '\uf03d1\n\nn\n\n\uf0e1 y ' | x\uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 | x' \uf0f1Px ' x\n\n(3.4.14a)\n\nx '\uf03d1\n\nn\n\nn\n\nx '\uf03d1\n\nx '\uf03d1\n\nP\u02c6 X\u02c6 | x\uf0f1 \uf03d x\uf0e5 | x '\uf0f1Px ' x \uf0b9 X\u02c6 P\u02c6 | x\uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5 x ' | x '\uf0f1Px ' x \uf0de P\u02c6 X\u02c6 \uf02d X\u02c6 P\u02c6 \uf0b9 0\n\n(3.4.14b)\n\nTherefore, the Hilbert space spanned by the eigenvectors of the transition matrix is NOT\nequivalent to the sample space of Markov chain.\nDr. Xing M Wang\n\nPBN: Hilbert Markov Diffusion\n\nPage 17 of 25\n\n\f11/22/2009\n\n2. In Appendix B of Ref.

Suppose that the\ndecomposition in Eq. (3.4.15) satisfies the normalization condition Eq.

(3.4.2a), it would not satisfy Eq.

(3.4.15) is NOT a transition\noperator in the sample space of Markov chain.\n4. Phase Space and Fock Space in Thermophysics\nIn this section, we discuss some simple examples of many-particle systems in\nThermophysics. The particles are identical and not interacting with each other. The\nsystem is in equilibrium at a given temperature T. We want to find the possible Hilbert\nstate of a single particle using Quantum Mechanics (QM) and the distribution function in\nsample (or phase) space given by statistic thermodynamics for semi-classical ideal gas.\nWe also want to find the relations between the Fock space of many-particle system in\nQuantum Field Theories (QFT) and the sample (phase) space in quantum statistics.\n4.1. The Wave Function of a Particle in Ideal Monatomic Gas\nWhat is the wave function of a single particle of monatomic ideal gas confined in a\nsquare well with fixed total number of molecules (N) and in equilibrium at temperature\nT? This is a good example of mapping between phase space and Hilbert space. (As we\nwill see in the next section, the system state is in Fock space of many-particle systems).\n\nDr. Xing M Wang\n\nPBN: Hilbert Markov Diffusion\n\nPage 18 of 25\n\n\f11/22/2009\nFirst, from QM, the Hamiltonian of a single particle is given by:\n\uf072\n\uf0682 2\n\u02c6\nH \uf03d\uf02d\n\uf0d1 \uf02b V ( x)\n2m\n\n(4.1.1)\n\nThe potential is a square well given by:\n\uf072 \uf0ec\uf0a5 if x \uf0a3 0 or x \uf0b3 a or y \uf0a3 0 or y \uf0b3 b or z \uf0a3 0 or z \uf0b3 c\nV ( x) \uf03d \uf0ed\n0, otherwise\n\uf0ee\n\n(4.1.2)\n\nThe base wave function (i.e., the eigenvector in coordinate representation; see [14], Eq.\n(2.2-12)) of the Hamiltonian is:\n1/ 2\n\uf072 \uf072\n\uf0e6 j x\uf070 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 j y \uf070 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 j z \uf070 \uf0f6\n\uf0e6 8 \uf0f6\n\uf079 ( x) \uf03d \uf0e1 x | j \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e7\nx \uf0f7 sin \uf0e7\uf0e7\ny \uf0f7\uf0f7 sin \uf0e7\nz\uf0f7\n\uf0f7 sin \uf0e7\n\uf0e8 abc \uf0f8\n\uf0e8 a \uf0f8 \uf0e8 b \uf0f8 \uf0e8 c \uf0f8\n\n(4.1.3)\n\n\uf072\nj\n\nThe general state ket of the particle is an expansion of base kets:\n2\n\uf072 \uf072\n\uf072\n\uf072 \uf072\n\uf072\nj z2 \uf0f6\uf0f7\nh 2 \uf0e6\uf0e7 j x2 j y\n\u02c6\n|\uf079 \uf0f1 \uf03d \uf0e5\nc\n(\nj\n)\n|\nj\n,\nH\n|\nj\n(\nj\n)\n|\nn\n,\n(\nj\n)\n\uf0f1\n\uf0f1\n\uf03d\n\uf065\n\uf0f1\n\uf065\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf072\n8m \uf0e7\uf0e8 a 2 b 2 c 2 \uf0f7\uf0f8\nj\n\n(4.1.4)\n\nHow do we find the expansion coefficients?

We also\nproposed the equivalence between the system states in the two spaces.\nThen, using two examples, we discussed Markov chains and diffusion maps in details.\nThe first example was a simple graph, which had a symmetric transition matrix. The\nsecond example was from a famous IR example, which used the right matrix R, generated\nfrom the document-term matrix A. The closeness relation of the documents was derived\nfrom diffusion map. We saw it was in consistence with the document closeness relation\nderived from SVD-metric method, which used the left matrix L, generated from the same\ndocument-term matrix A. This implies that we might have two mutually complementary\nways of data clustering, based on the same document-term matrix A. We also mentioned\nthat the diffusion space (or the Hilbert space spanned by the eigenvectors of transition\nmatrix) is not equivalent to the Markov sample space, because they do not share base\nobservable. Our examples are rather pedagogic than pragmatic. We need to verify our\nprocedure against a fairly large text document collection in order to compare diffusion\nmap with SVD.\nFinally, as a PBN application to Thermophysics, we derived the wave function of a single\nparticle of semi-classical ideal gas confined in a square well. We also showed the\nequivalence of the expectation value of operators in Fock space and in our PBN for\nsystem of identical fermions or bosons.\n\nDr. Xing M Wang\n\nPBN: Hilbert Markov Diffusion\n\nPage 24 of 25\n\n\f11/22/2009\nReferences\n[1].
