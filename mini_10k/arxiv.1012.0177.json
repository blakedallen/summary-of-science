While there is a wealth of data\nfrom Rhic that will soon be supplemented with measurements at the Lhc, on the theoretical side the situation is less\nclear. A thorough understanding of jet quenching is, however, beneficial, as it is expected that medium-induced\nmodifications of jets allow one to characterise properties of the QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions. This\ntalk aims at summarising the main ideas and concepts of the currently available Monte Carlo models for jet quenching.\nKeywords: jet quenching, Monte Carlo\n\n1. Introduction\nThe perhaps most general and most insightful definition of the Monte Carlo (MC) method is given by Halton: \"The\nMonte Carlo method is defined as representing the solution of a problem as a parameter of a hypothetical population,\nand using a random sequence of numbers to construct a sample of the population, from which statistical estimates of\nthe parameter can be obtained.\" [1] This seems to be rather unspecific, which is due to the fact that MC techniques\nhave a very broad range of applications to both statistical and deterministic problems. A more pragmatic attempt is\ntherefore made by James in defining: \"A Monte Carlo technique is any technique making use of random numbers to\nsolve a problem.\" [2] While this is perhaps of more practical use, it is still not very helpful for the understanding of\nhow MC methods are used and how they work. Narrowing the scope down to the applications under consideration\nhere, one can arrive at a more specific definition: In high energy physics, we use our theories, physical intuition\nand models to devise computer programs that simulate high energy reactions by using random numbers to construct\nsynthetic events (Monte Carlo event generators).\n2. General considerations\nThere are conceptually very different approaches to Monte Carlo generators. In one extreme limit, the MC is a\nfaithful representation of a theory. The parton shower, which performs a resummation of large logarithms associated\n\n\fK. C. Zapp / Nuclear Physics A 00 (2018) 1\u20137\n\n2\n\nwith collinear gluon emission to leading logarithmic (LL) accuracy, falls into this category. All parton shower implementations correctly reproduce the LL behaviour, differences between the implementations (choice of evolution\nvariable, scale choices etc.) are beyond LL accuracy. In cases where a MC does nothing else but represent a theory, it\nobviously has no tunable parameters1 and there is control over the systematic accuracy.\nIn contrast to this, MC's can also be phenomenological models (in the extreme case the model is defined by its\nMC implementation), that are used in cases where there is little or no theoretical guidance. An example for this\nare hadronisation models. This kind of MC's typically has parameters that have to be tuned to data. While formal\naccuracy is not a meaningful concept in this context, the quality of phenomenological models can be assessed using\ncriteria like accordance with physical principles, internal consistency or ability to describe or predict a variety of\nexperimental data.\nBoth approaches (and hybrids) are perfectly legitimate. Since MC generators are used in very different ways, the\nchoice of model or generator \u2013 insofar as several exist \u2013 will depend on the application. On the theory side, one\nmight want to use MC's to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of some phenomenon (this obviously applies\nto problems that cannot simply be calculated in theory). In this case, a model that incorporates as many theoretical\nconstraints and as few parameters as possible is preferable. A perfect description of experimental data does not have\nhigh priority, a reasonable description of the qualitative behaviour is often sufficient.\nThe experiments, on the other hand, need MC tools to, for instance, estimate the experimental efficiencies, corrections, backgrounds etc., or do unfolding. For this kind of applications it is often advantageous to have models that are\nmore flexible and can be tuned to describe the data well.\nMC's are also used to extrapolate from (phase space) regions, where measurements have been performed, to\nregions, where there is no data. In order for the extrapolation to be reliable one needs a well constrained model with\nnot too many parameters. This may lead to a somewhat worse description of the existing data than what more flexible\nand more phenomenological models can achieve, but the predictive power is typically larger.\nMC generators have become indispensable tools in particle physics and all important aspects of electron-positron\nand (anti)proton-proton collisions are under control in the modern multi-purpose event generators Herwig[3], Pythia[4]\nand Sherpa[5]. Here, only the elements relevant for jet production will be briefly introduced.\nmatrix elements: The hard matrix elements (ME) are calculated at fixed order in perturbation theory and are available\nin the MC generators at leading (LO) or next-to-leading (NLO) order.\nfinal state parton shower: The parton shower (PS) performs a resummation of collinear logarithms to leadinglogarithmic (LL) accuracy. It dresses all (strongly interacting2 ) outgoing legs from the ME with collinear\nradiation. At the infra-red cut-off scale the PS is interfaced with a hadronisation model.\ninitial state parton shower: The initial state PS exists only in hadronic collisions and works like the final state PS,\nbut has a boundary condition at the infra-red cut-off scale that is given by the parton distribution functions\n(pdf's). They describe the proton structure and are obtained from global fits.\nhadronisation: Hadronisation is governed by non-perturbative physics and so phenomenological models are employed.\nThis well established picture gets modified due to the presence of a dense and strongly interaction medium when\njet production in heavy-ion collisions is considered. While a consistent theoretical treatment is still missing, general\nconsiderations and observations lead to the following qualitative picture:\nmatrix elements: The ME's are not modified due to the high scale they involve, which means that they are confined\nto very short length and time scales and occur very early in the collision.\n1 Most MC generators tune the parton shower cut-off together with the hadronisation, but the scale at which one stops trusting perturbation\ntheory is strictly speaking not a parameter of the theory or its MC implementation. Also, some generators tune the scale of the strong coupling\nconstant in the parton shower, but this is again beyond LL.\n2 Resummations of photon radiation also exist, but will not be considered here.\n\n\fK. C. Zapp / Nuclear Physics A 00 (2018) 1\u20137\n\n3\n\nfinal state parton shower: The final state PS evolves on a much longer time scale and thus overlaps with the dense\nmedium formed in the final state of heavy-ion collisions. Modifications of the PS are thus expected, but no\ngeneral theory exists. There are, however, a number of calculations for special cases like the single gluon\nradiation spectrum in the eikonal limit.\ninitial state parton shower: The initial state PS evolves in only cold nuclear matter density and was found to be\nunmodified at Rhic from measuring direct hard photon production in nucleus-nucleus and high-p\u22a5 hadron production in proton-nucleus collisions.\nhadronisation: Modifications of the hadronisation stage are generally expected at least for hadrons at low and intermediate energies, but there is no theoretical guidance.\nConsequently, one has to rely on models for the description of medium modified jets. Analytical calculations are\nsuccessful in explaining leading hadron suppression, but cannot be generalised to describe the complete jet fragmentation pattern. Furthermore, no consistent quantitative picture has emerged from studying leading hadrons. At Rhic\nreconstruction of jets is under way and at the Lhc a large fraction of the jets will be accessible above background.\nThere is thus a need for MC generators modelling jet quenching on the basis of multi-particle final states, as the experiments need MC tools to perform their measurements and there is a strong theoretical interest in studying sub-leading\nfragments. The main reason is that sub-leading particles are likely to discriminate between different microscopic\nmechanisms conjectured to underlie jet quenching. A thorough understanding of medium-induced modifications of\nthe entire jet fragmentation pattern is thus requisite for a characterisation of the QCD matter produced in heavy ion\ncollisions based on jet quenching. Furthermore, MC's may help to characterise also the jet-induced modifications of\nthe medium and to disentangle jets and background \u2013 a problem that receives attention from both the theoretical and\nexperimental community.\n3. Update on JEWEL\nWhen one moves away from the eikonal limit one faces a couple of problems. For instance, elastic and inelastic\nscattering are not well separated concepts any more. Since (elastic) interactions with scattering centres in the medium\ncan transfer energy and momentum to the hard parton, they can induce radiation off the projectile and thus become\ninelastic. Another problem is that 'vacuum' and 'medium induced radiation' are indistinguishable. These are probably\nthe most severe obstacles, although other issues like the radiation off the scattering centre also have to be accounted\nfor.\nThe solution to these problems implemented in the latest version of Jewel is to describe scattering in the medium\nusing 2 \u2192 2 partonic matrix elements supplemented with parton showers as in proton-proton collisions. In fact,\nin the standard description of hard proton-proton collisions the parton shower is nothing but the bremsstrahlung of\nthe hard interaction and it therefore makes sense to use the same language for the medium induced radiation. The\nadvantages of this approach are that it naturally generates elastic and inelastic interactions. The parton shower on top\nof 2 \u2192 2 ME's reproduces the collinear enhanced regions of the 2 \u2192 2 + n ME's and it is known in principle how\nto systematically improve on this approximation. Vacuum and medium induced radiation are not only incorporated in\na common framework, but have indeed become the same phenomenon and there is thus a natural interplay between\nthem. Finally, it is possible to include the LPM-interference based on the probabilistic algorithm derived in[6, 7].\n4. Overview over MC models\nIt is the aim of this section to give a brief overview over the main ideas and features of the existing MC models\nfor jet quenching in roughly chronological order, for details the reader is referred to the original publications.\nHIJING\nHijing[8, 9] simulates complete heavy-ion events with hard and semi-hard (mini-)jet components and a soft part\nbased on a model for the formation and decay of colour strings. Hard matrix elements and parton showers are\nsimulated using Pythia.\n\n\fK. C. Zapp / Nuclear Physics A 00 (2018) 1\u20137\n\n4\n\nradiative energy loss: Radiative energy loss is modelled by collinear parton splittings, where the energy sharing is\ntaken from an analytical calculation. The colour connection between the two outgoing partons is assumed to be\nbroken so that the colour (string) topology of the event changes.\ncollisional energy loss: There is no collisional energy loss.\nmedium: The energy loss model uses a constant mean free path and screening length.\nhadronisation: The Lund string model is used for hadronisation. The softer parton distribution together with the\nmodified colour topology leads to a softer hadronic ensemble.\nexample for an application: Due to its ability to generate complete heavy-ion events, Hijing has for instance been\nused to study the influence of background fluctuations on jet measurements[10].\nPYQUEN/HYDJET\nHydjet[11] also simulates complete heavy-ion events, but in contrast to Hijing it uses a hydrodynamical model for\nthe soft component. Jet production and interactions of the jets in the medium are modelled using Pyquen[12], which\nagain is built on matrix elements and parton showers of Pythia.\nradiative energy loss: At each scattering a gluon sampled from a BDMPS radiation spectrum is radiated under a\nfinite angle. The radiated gluon stays within the colour singlet system of the parent parton.\ncollisional energy loss: The collisional energy loss is based on a high-energy approximation of the LO perturbative\n2 \u2192 2 partonic scattering matrix elements.\nmedium: The medium is modelled as a quark-gluon fluid undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion (Bjorken\nmodel).\nhadronisation: Finally, the hard component of the event is hadronised using the Lund string model.\nexample for an application: Pyquen/Hydjet runs very fast and has thus been used to extract medium modified fragmentation functions[13].\nJEWEL\nIt is the objective of Jewel[14, 6] to develop a dynamically consistent MC model for jet quenching, that is consistent with all analytically known limiting cases. It is the most specialised project in the sense that it does not simulate\nmatrix elements, but only the final state parton shower and hadronisation.\nradiative energy loss: In its newest form Jewel has a pQCD based microscopic model for interactions in the medium\nincluding a local implementation of the LPM-effect.\ncollisional energy loss: Collisional energy loss is naturally included in the above model.\nmedium: For the medium several options are foreseen: a semi-analytical Bjorken model and an interface to hydrodynamic calculations.\nhadronisation: For hadronisation an adapted version of the Lund string model (based on Pythia) is used.\nexample for an application: As a consequence of the detailed and democratic treatment of medium interactions and\njet evolution Jewel is well suited for jet observables like event shapes and jet rates[14].\n\n\fK. C. Zapp / Nuclear Physics A 00 (2018) 1\u20137\n\n5\n\nQ-PYTHIA/Q-HERWIG\nThe philosophy of the Q-Pythia/Q-Herwig[15, 16] project is to construct a minimal, theory based MC model\nfor medium-modified jets. Q-Pythia/Q-Herwig simulate only jets, the matrix elements are taken from Pythia and\nHerwig, respectively. The parton shower routines are modified such that the final state parton shower has a modified\nsplitting function.\nradiative energy loss: The splitting function in the final state parton shower is written as Ptot = Pvac + \u2206P, where\n\u2206P is derived from a BDMPS gluon spectrum under the assumption that the relation of gluon spectrum and\nsplitting function is the same as for vacuum emissions. The treatment of colour is the same as in vacuum.\ncollisional energy loss: There is no collisional energy loss.\nmedium: The medium has to be specified by the user.\nhadronisation: Q-Pythia and Q-Herwig use the Lund string model and Herwig's cluster hadronisation, respectively.\nexample for an application: Because of its consistent treatment of intra-jet dynamics Q-Pythia has for instance been\nused to investigate jet broadening[17].\nYaJEM\nYaJEM[18, 19] also modifies the Pythia parton shower. It is assumed that the dominant effect of interactions in\nthe medium is that the virtuality of hard and semi-hard partons is increased.\nradiative energy loss: The virtuality of partons is increased between the splittings generated by the Pythia parton\nshower by an amount given by a local transport coefficient.\ncollisional energy loss: The energy and momentum of partons is reduced by an amount given by a local drag coefficient.\nmedium: The medium is taken from a hydrodynamic calculation.\nhadronisation: Hadronisation is taken care of by the Lund string model in Pythia, the colour topology is assumed to\nbe the same as in vacuum.\nexample for an application: YaJEM can be used to study jet observables like the angular distribution of partons\nforming a jet[18].\nMARTINI\nMartini[20] is built on the Amy results for partonic energy loss. It also uses Pythia for matrix elements, parton\nshower generation and hadronisation.\nradiative energy loss: After the final state parton shower the partons are propagated through the medium with the\nhelp of rate equations, where the transition rates are taken from Amy. There is no exchange of colour with the\nmedium so that radiated gluons remain colour correlated with the parent parton.\ncollisional energy loss: Transition rates for elastic scattering are calculated in pQCD and included in the same way\nas the inelastic processes.\nmedium: Different hydrodynamic calculations can be used.\nhadronisation: Hadronisation is performed using the Lund string model.\nexample for an application: Nuclear modification factors have been calculated with Martini[20].\n\n\fK. C. Zapp / Nuclear Physics A 00 (2018) 1\u20137\n\n6\n\n5. Summary and Outlook\nThe MC landscape is clearly diverse and cannot easily be summarised. Still, there are some noticeable trends.\n\u2022 Most of the models use hydrodynamical calculations as model for the medium. There is, however, so far no\nsystematic investigation of the sensitivity of classes of observables to details of the modelling of the medium.\n\u2022 The majority of models implements a democratic treatment of all partons. This is very important in order to\narrive at a consistent modelling of sub-leading fragments and has potentially large impact on observables.\n\u2022 Some models consider modifications of the parton shower based on the argument that the parton shower evolves\non a time scale that is comparable to the lifetime of the medium and the transverse size of the nuclear overlap\nregion.\n\u2022 In line with the argument that radiative processes are the dominant source of energy loss for energetic partons\nall MC's include a model for radiative energy loss.\n\u2022 It was found that collisional energy loss can be numerically important and by now it is included in most of the\nmodels.\n\u2022 Induced radiation and the LPM suppression are mostly treated in an effective way owing to the difficulties\nassociated with the treatment of quantum mechanical interference effects in probabilistic frameworks such as\nMC's.\n\u2022 There is a hadronisation monoculture in the sense that except for Q-Herwig all projects use the Lund string\nmodel. The different treatment of colour underlines a fundamental problem, namely that hadronisation in a\nnuclear environment is poorly understood.\nInstead of aiming for a comprehensive review of all recent developments, only a few shall be exemplarily highlighted here.\nA first study of induced radiation off a colour dipole was carried out and found an angular separation of mediuminduced and vacuum radiation[21].\nIn a detailed investigation the probabilistic formulation of the LPM-effect[6] was shown to quantitatively reproduce the BDMPS results[7].\nFirst attempts have been made to characterise the effect of jet energy loss on the medium in the context of a\nhydrodynamical calculation[22] and in a particle picture[14].\nThere remain, obviously, a number of issues that have to be addressed by future investigations. The interplay of\nvacuum and medium-induced emissions in realistic kinematics, for instance, is largely an unsolved problem. There is\nsome guidance from analytical calculations in near-eikonal kinematics, but generalisation to realistic scenarios is far\nfrom trivial.\nAnother problem is uncertainties. As discussed earlier, phenomenological models have no formal accuracy. However, uncertainties can sometimes be quantified by mapping out a range of reasonable models or assumptions. The\ndependence on the choice of evolution variable could for instance by studied by comparing results from angular, virtuality and k\u22a5 ordered parton showers. Large uncertainties can \u2013 depending on the observable \u2013 also be associated\nto the exact modelling of hadronisation. Here, using different models and comparing different ideas of how colour\nshould be treated could also help to get an estimate of the size and systematics of uncertainties.\nJet-induced modifications of the medium are not yet well understood but are potentially important for jet measurements at the Lhc. Large background contributions have to be subtracted from the total energy measured inside a jet to\narrive at the true jet energy. The background is estimated in regions outside the jet so that a significant modification\nof the background close to the jet may bias the extracted jet energies.\nThe description of jets in heavy-ion collisions is largely based on models, as a universally valid theory is missing.\nAs there is no consensus about the microscopic mechanisms responsible for interactions of hard partons in a dense\nmedium and thus the phenomenon of jet quenching or the language that should be used to describe them a variety\nof (Monte Carlo) models have been developed. In this situation the application dictates the choice of the tool. If\nused wisely MC models in conjunction with Lhc jet data have the potential to play a central role in deciphering jet\nquenching.\n\n\fK. C.
