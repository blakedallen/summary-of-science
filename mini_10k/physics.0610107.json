A particularly sensitive method for characterizing mass transfer\nand detecting flow heterogeneities is the dispersion of a\ntracer in a flow of fluid through these media.\nIn homogeneous 3D porous media, the variation in\nthe flow direction x of the concentration C of passive\ntracer is often observed to satisfy at a macroscopic scale\n(a few pore sizes) the classical convection-diffusion equation [1]:\n\u2202C\n\u2202C\n\u22022C\n+U\n= Dk 2\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(1)\n\nHere, U is the flow velocity and Dk is the dispersion coefficient measured in the flow direction and which characterizes the longitudinal spreading of the tracers during\ntheir transport.\nIn porous media, the dispersion coefficient is observed\nto be velocity dependent [3]. At a low velocity, molecular diffusion predominates and the dispersion coefficient is close to the molecular diffusion coefficient Dm .\nWhen the velocity increases, different regimes are observed and non trivial relations such as power law variations of the dispersion coefficient with the velocity are\nreported [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The objective of the present\npaper is to report dispersion experiments on well controlled models consisting of beads placed inside a long\ncapillary. Different ordered and disordered bead layouts\n\nB.\n\nKey dispersion mechanisms\n\nTwo physical mechanisms cause the dispersion of passive tracers: molecular diffusion across and along streamlines and advection. Advection refers to tracer transport\nby the motion of the host fluid. In order to compare\nboth mechanisms, it is useful to define the P\u00e9clet number: P e = U d/Dm where d is a characteristic length\nscale. In this work, d is either the bead or the tube diameter (the latter is used when the flow tube does not\ncontain any beads).\nIn porous media, the void structure is complex, resulting in tortuous streamlines along which the velocity\nmay greatly fluctuate. In randomly packed beads, for instance, current tubes often get split so that the fluid may\nflow around a bead; this results in variations of both the\nmagnitude and the direction of the local velocity [11, 12].\nWith respect to the average flow, tracers therefore perform a random walk between pores characterized by the\nduration t \u223c d/U of single steps where d is the bead\ndiameter. Using this description, one expects a longitudinal dispersion coefficient Dk /Dm \u223c d2 /Dm t \u223c P e and\na dispersivity, ld = Dk /U , constant and corresponding to\nthe correlation length of the velocity field. Yet, regions of\nslow moving fluid, such as boundary layers, may also play\na significant part and lead to logarithmic corrections [13].\nIn some specific configurations such as flow in a\ncapillary tube [14, 15], in a periodic square array of\nbeads [9, 16] or in a fracture [5, 6, 7], the velocity field has\nlong range correlations. In such media, the flow velocity\ndifference between the walls bounding the open space and\n\n\f2\nits center stretches the tracer front and creates concentration gradients: The latter are balanced by molecular\ndiffusion across the gradient. In such a case, the typical time for the decorrelation of the tracer velocity is\n: t \u223c d2 /Dm i.e. the characteristic time of molecular\ndiffusion across the streamlines and the dispersion coefficient scales like Dk /Dm \u221d P e2 . This regime is often\ncalled Taylor dispersion and, for flow in a capillary tube\nof inner diameter D, one finds [15]:\nDk\nP e2\n=1+\n,\nDm\n192\n\n(2)\n\n\u2022 (E) Empty channel : the capillary tube is devoid of\nbeads.\n\nwhere P e = U D/Dm . Equivalently, one can write :\n1\nPe\nld\n=\n+\n.\nd\nP e 192\n\n(3)\n\nWhile periodic 3D porous media are very difficult to realize experimentally (even using perfectly monodisperse\nbeads), the transition from Taylor to geometrical dispersion could be demonstrated numerically on 2D networks\nof increasing disorder [10].\nYet, some experiments on geological materials, either\nat the lab or field scales, display non Fickian characteristics. In these situations, the breakthrough curves\nobserved are characterized by tails at long times. This\neffect may be explain either by the presence of heterogeneities at the scale of the sample or by the trapping of\nsolute in microscopic dead ends or stagnant pores.\nIn this work, dispersion experiments in bead packings of varying degrees of disorder are reported. Depending on the structure of the packings, a variety of\ndispersion regimes is observed ranging from geometrical\nto Taylor dispersion and including intermediate regimes\nand non Fickian dispersion. From these experiments, the\ntube/bead diameter ratio appears as a key control parameter of the dispersion regime.\nII.\n\nis D = 3.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm, its length is 1500 mm and well\ncalibrated stainless steel spheres of diameter d are used.\nBeads of diameter d = 2.54 \u00b1 0.02 mm were chosen in\norder to reproduce the configuration used by Baudet et\nal [17]. In addition to these two bead packs, two more\nconfigurations were used (see Fig. 1). The first one uses\nthe same tube but empty. In the last one, the diameter of\nthe beads is d = 1\u00b10.01 mm, i.e. three time smaller than\nthe tube diameter, leading to a larger tube-to-particle ratio. In order to clarify the present paper, the following\nconvention is used :\n\n\u2022 (O) Ordered channel : the tube contains a periodic\nline of beads touching each other.\n\u2022 (DI) Disordered channel I : the beads are still\ntouching each other but build up a disordered array. The tube/bead diameter ratio is 1.22.\n\u2022 (DII) Disordered channel II : the arrangement is\nof the same type as (DI) but the diameter of the\nbeads is smaller d = 1 \u00b1 0.01 mm. The tube/bead\ndiameter ratio is 3.1.\nIn configurations (O) and (DI), the diameter of the\nspheres is slightly smaller than the tube diameter (d =\n2.54 \u00b1 0.02 mm). In configuration (DII), the diameter\nof the beads is three times smaller than that of the tube\n(d = 1 \u00b1 0.01 mm) Originally, one end of the capillary\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SET-UP AND\nPROCEDURE\n\nThe experimental model used in this work closely resembles that used by Baudet and coworkers [17]. In this\nlatter work, tracer dispersion was measured in a long\ncapillary tube filled with monodisperse beads and with a\ntube/particle diameter ratio of the order of 1.25. The layout of the beads was either periodic or disordered. The\nfirst configuration was achieved by adding one by one\nbeads in an horizontal capillary tube. Finally, one ends\nup with a line of beads, each of them being in contact\nwith its two neighbors and with the tube wall. The second layout is obtained by tilting the capillary tubes while\nfilling them. The beads fall then on top of each other and\nslide often sideways, resulting in a denser packing. The\nfinal packing is random and beads are added in the tube\nuntil it is entirely filled.\nIn this work, the inner diameter of the capillary tube\n\nFIG. 1: Flow geometries used in the experiments. From top\nto bottom : Empty Channel - Ordered Channel - Disordered\nChannel I - Disordered Channel II.\n\ntube is connected to a syringe pump allowing to establish a stationary flow of the transparent fluid through the\nchannel: A valve allows to switch the injection to a dyed\nsolution of identical properties. Fluid flowing out of the\nother end of the tube is weighed by computer controlled\nscales, allowing to measure the flow rate throughout the\nexperiment.\n\n\f3\nThe fluids used are solutions of either 10% or 70% of\nglycerol in water and their dynamic viscosities \u03bc are respectively 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 Pa.s and 23 \u00d7 10\u22123 Pa.s (at 20o C).\nWater Blue dye at a concentration of 0.05 g/l is added\nto one of the solutions: It has been selected because it\nis chemically stable and does not modify the rheological properties of the solution. The molecular diffusion\ncoefficient Dm of the dye was determined through independent Taylor dispersion measurements performed in a\nvertical teflon capillary tube. One obtains in this way\nDm = 6.5 10\u22124 mm2 /s for the 10% glycerol solution;\nfor the 70% solution, the value Dm = 3.25 10\u22125 mm2 /s\nis deduced from the value for the first solution by the\nStokes-Einstein relation [18]. In the present experiments,\nthe P\u00e9clet number ranges from 50 to 104 for the 10%\nglycerol solution but reaches 1.4 \u00d7 105 for 70% glycerol\nsolutions. In all the studies the Reynolds number is less\nthan 1 except for the empty tube where Re can reach\n10: Under such conditions, the flow can be considered as\nstationary [11].\nIn this work, the variation of the tracer concentration at the outlet with time, known as the breakthrough\ncurve, is determined from light absorption by the dye.\nThe measurement is realized over a square window of size\n0.3 mm2 located at 1450 mm from the injection, close to\nthe outlet and immediately downstream of the last bead\nof the bed. In order to reduce optical distorsion induced\nby the tube curvature, the measurement section is enclosed within a transparent plexiglas cell with flat parallel walls. The cell is originally filled with glycerol, a fluid\nwith a refractive index close to that of the tube. The\nsection of the tube inside this cell is inserted between a\nlight panel and a 4096 gray levels CCD camera (Roper\nCoolsnap CF). The set-up is illuminated by a fluorescent\ntube placed on the opposite side from the camera and\nexcited at a high frequency to reduce fluctuations. For\neach experiment, 2000 images are recorded by a computer connected to the camera at time intervals ranging\nfrom 1 to 30 sec depending on the flow rate. Dye concentration values are determined quantitatively using calibration measurements realized independently with the\nexperimental tube saturated with dye solutions of different known concentrations. Finally, drifts of the light\nintensity are measured in a region of interest outside the\ntube; these measurements are then used during the analysis of the images to compensate for the effect of these\nvariations on the transmitted light intensity in the experimental section.\nUsing this experimental procedure, breakthrough\ncurves were measured for different flow velocities and for\ndifferent bead layouts. The results of these global measurements are given and discussed in section III. Moreover, in order to improve interpretations of the breakthrough curves, visualizations realized independently at\na local scale in a similar configuration were carried out.\nIn these latter experiments, a transparent tube of D =\n8 mm inner diameter is filled with glass beads of diameters 6, 3 or 2 mm. These beads were chosen so that the\n\ncorresponding tube/bead diameter ratio is respectively\n1.33, 2.67 and 4, close to the values used in the dispersion experiment. Originally, the model is saturated with\nglycerol (viscosity \u2243 1 Pa.s) which is displaced by the\nsame fluid but dyed. Using a fluid with such a high viscosity (and therefore a low diffusion coefficient) allows to\nobserve and separate clearly the various flow paths at low\nReynolds numbers inside the sample.\nBefore describing in detail the various dispersive\nregimes observed for the different bead layouts, the next\nsection describes the methods used to determine the dispersion coefficients from the breakthrough curves.\nA.\n\nAnalysis of experimental curves\n\nFigure 2 displays a typical breakthrough curve obtained after a stepwise injection of the dyed fluid; asymmetrical curves were also obtained and their analyzis\nwill be discussed later. Under such initial conditions\nand if the concentration satisfies the classical convectiondiffusion equation given by Eq. (1), the concentration\nvariation at the outlet is given by:\nC(L, t)\n1\nL \u2212 Ut\n).\n= (1 \u2212 erf p\nC0\n2\n4Dk t\n\n(4)\n\nWhere, C0 is the dye concentration in the displacing fluid,\nL the distance between the measurement section and the\ninjection point, Dk is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, U is the mean flow velocity. The figure (2) shows\nthe fit of the breakthrough curve by the function given\nby Eq. (4) where the only adjustable parameter is Dk .\nThe two curves are almost undistinguishable, indicating\nthat the dispersion process is Fickian and that the classical convection-diffusion equation (1) is satisfied.

For instance,\nin the O configuration and for fairly high velocities U ,\none observes at long times, as can be seen on Fig. 3, a\n\n\f4\n\"tail\" effect : it corresponds to an exponential relaxation\nof the concentration towards a limiting value with a typical time of the order of L/U . Such breakthrough curves\nare better fitted by solutions of the classical Coats-Smith\ncapacitive model [19] which uses four fitting parameters:\nt = L/U , Dk , f and tf . The two last parameters correspond to the amplitude and the characteristic time of\nthe exponential variation in the \"tail\" at long times. By\ncombining these parameters, one obtains an asymptotic\ndispersion coefficient Dkas :\nDkas\nDk\n=\n+ (1 \u2212 f )2 U 2 tf ,\nDm\nDm\n\ncient was found to be identical in the two experiments,\nimplying that no instabilities modified the flow.\n\n(5)\n\nDkas represents the value of the dispersion coefficient\nthat would be measured for channels with the same local\nstructure, but long enough so that a Gaussian dispersion\nregime is reached and Eq. (1) becomes valid. Note that\nthe Coats-Smith model is only used here as a mathematical way of obtaining the value of Dkas ; the fact that the\nexperimental curves are well fitted by the model does not\nmean that its underlying assumptions are valid (namely\nthe existence of a zero flow zone with an exponential exchange with the mean flow). In the following, the dispersivity ld is taken equal to Dkas /U only for experiments\nin the O configuration, in the other configurations, Dk is\nobtained by fitting the experimental curves to Eq. (4).\n\nFIG. 4: Variation of the dispersivity ld as a function of the\nP\u00e9clet number: (\u25b3) DII\u2212array; (\u25e6, \u2022) DI\u2212 array respectively\nfor solutions of 10% and 70% glycerol in water; (\u0004) E\u2212 array;\n(\u0003) O\u2212 array (in this latter case ld = Dkas /U ).\n\nA.\n\nIn the case of an empty tube, all the experimental\ndispersion curves are well adjusted by the concentration\nvariation given by Eq. (4). The corresponding dispersivities ld , as plotted in Figure 4, increase linearly with\nP e reflecting, as expected from Eq. (3), a dominant influence of Taylor dispersion. One sees from Eq. (3) that\nthe value of ld is related to the tube diameter; a linear\nregression of the data gives indeed an effective value of\nthe tube diameter : aef f \u2243 3 \u00b1 0.2 mm.\nB.\n\nFIG. 3: Continuous line : experimental dye concentration\nvariation as a function of time for an ordered O\u2212type array\nof 2.54 mm diameter beads and for P e = 1000.

Note\nthat all the experiments were carried out twice: First,\nthe dyed fluid was injected to displace the clear solution\nflowing initially in the model at the same flow rate. After\nthe model has been completeley saturated with the dyed\nfluid, it is displaced in a second experiment by the clear\nfluid, still at the same flow rate. The dispersion coeffi-\n\nEmpty tube (E\u2212Channel)\n\nOrdered array of beads (O\u2212Channel)\n\nDispersivity ld values for the ordered array of beads\nplotted in Figure 4 were obtained with the Coats-Smith\nmodel. For P e \u2264 2500, ld varies with P e following a\npower law : ld \u223c aef f P e\u03b1 (straight line in log-log coordinates). From a regression over the experimental data,\none obtains aef f \u2243 0.6 mm and \u03b1 = 0.85 \u00b1 0.2: This\nvalue is compatible with a Taylor dispersion mechanism\nfor which \u03b1 = 1.\nOne can indeed expect that, in this channel, fluid\nparticles follow streamlines determined by the periodic\nstructure of the bed of beads: Therefore, as in capillary tubes, tracer can only move from a streamline to\nanother through molecular diffusion (See Fig. 5). An important feature is the fact that the experimental values\nof ld which vary from 40 mm to 400 mm are about 8\ntimes larger than for the empty capillary tube at a same\nmean flow velocity. This cannot be explained by the partial filling up of the flow channel by the beads. On the\nopposite, since these reduce the effective aperture of the\nflow channels, ld should drop off following Eq.(3) which\nis not observed.\n\n\f5\nDirect visualizations realized in a similar periodic geometry (Figure 5), although with larger beads, help understand these results: Pure glycerol is used in these experiments to visualize clearly the boundaries between fluids by removing the influence of molecular diffusion. In\n\nlength of the velocities of fluid particles along their path\nis too short for Taylor dispersion to have a significant\ninfluence. Dispersion characteristics of such arrays are\nthen comparable to those of non consolidated packings\nof monodisperse grains: In this latter case, the minimum\nvalue of ld is lower than the grain size (typ. 0.6 \u2212 0.7 dg )\nand is reached for P\u00e9clet numbers (based on the grain\nsize) of the order of 10 [20]. In Fig. 4, the value of ld\nfor a similar P\u00e9clet number (P e = 30 when based on the\ntube diameter) is ld = 2 mm or about twice the bead\ndiameter. This result also suggests that boundary layers\nhave a weaker influence on dispersion than predicted by\nsome theories [13] since no increase of ld as LogP e is\nobserved.\n\nFIG. 5: Miscible displacement of pure by dyed glycerol in an\nordered array of beads inside a capillary tube : (a) side view\n(b) top view (bead diameter : d = 6 mm; tube diameter :\nD = 8 mm)\n\nthis figure, one observes that the dyed fluid displays a\ntongue like structure and wraps around the beads. This\nshape shows that the streamlines are mostly oriented in\nthe flow direction with tiny undulations induced by the\nbeads. Another important point is that the dyed fluid\ndoes not flow in the narrow space between the beads:\nMass transfert between the two regions can thus only occur through molecular diffusion. This explains the long\ntail observed in the breakthrough curves. Finally, the\ntongue-like structure reveals the strong velocity contrast\nbetween the fluid flow on the side of the beads and above\nthem. The velocity gradient stretches the tracer fronts\nresulting in a concentration gradient which, in turn, gets\nsmoothed by a transverse diffusive flux.\nAll ingredients of a Taylor like dispersion regime are thus\npresent. Yet, because of the beads, the diffusive flux is\nmore tortuous than in an empty capillary tube: Tracer\nhas to flow around the beads to reach the outlet of the\ntube. The time needed to homogenize the tracer concentration in the tube section is thus longer, resulting in a\nhigher dispersivity.\nAt the highest flow velocities, the variation of ld levels off and it starts to decrease. A possible explanation\nis the fact that, in this range of P e values, the Reynolds\nnumber becomes higher than 1 (Re > 5): recirculation\nflows may then develop and induce a more efficient transverse mixing than molecular diffusion. This may account\nfor the decreasing value of ld at high P\u00e9clet numbers.\n\nC.\n\nDisordered array of small beads (DII\u2212array)\n\nFor a disordered array of 1 mm diameter beads inside\nthe tube, the dispersivity ld increases slowly as a function\nof P e before reaching a constant value of the order of\n3 mm for P e & 600. This constant limiting value of ld\nimplies that geometrical dispersion associated with the\nrandom velocity variations from one pore to the next\nis dominant. Also, in such geometries, the correlation\n\nFIG. 6: Miscible displacements of pure glycerol by dyed\nglycerol saturating disordered glass beads packings inside a\nD = 8 mm diameter capillary tube. Bead diameter : (a)\nd = 2 mm - (b) d = 3 mm. The tube/particle diameter ratio\nis respectively 4 and 2.66.\n\nVisualizations realized with d = 2 and 3 mm beads\ninside a D = 8 mm diameter tube (Figs 6a-b) help understand these results. Figure 6a demonstrates clearly the\nmany divisions of the front of injected fluid after moving through several pores and the rather uniform distribution of the invading fluid across the flow section :\nfor the less viscous fluids used in our dispersion experiments, transverse molecular diffusion would mix quickly\nthese thin filaments with the surrounding fluid, leading\nto the Gaussian dispersion observed for the DII\u2212 array.\nFor the lower value 2.66 of the ratio d/D the shape of\nthe dye streaks changes very much as shown on Figure 6b.\nIn this particular case, flow is strongly channelized in the\ncenter of the column; this indicates, that for some (low)\nvalues of the ratio d/D, pathological structures of the\nflow field may appear. The dispersion measurements reported in the present section were performed with a column for which d/D was intermediate between the two\nvalues in Figs. 6a-b. Since no channelization of the flow\nwas observed visually during the measurement, the geometrical dispersion observed corresponds most likely to\nthe type of flow structure shown in Fig.6a. In the next\nsection, tracer dispersion is investigated for still smaller\nvalues of d/D.\n\n\f6\nD.\n\nDisordered array of large beads (DI\u2212array)\n\nIn this case, the beads have the same diameter as in\nthe periodic O\u2212 channel (i.e. d = 2.54 mm), but the\npacking is now disordered (See Fig. 1). The experiments\nwere performed using the two water-glycerol solutions\ncontaining either 10% or 70% of glycerol in weight. As for\nthe DII array and in contrast with the ordered one, all\nbreakthrough curves are well adjusted by Eq. (4) allowing\nfor the determination of Dk for the various flow conditions. The Figure 4 shows the dispersivity ld = Dk /U\nas a function of the P\u00e9clet number for the two solutions\nused in the experiments.\nClearly, the dispersivity ld and P e have a power law relationship. Fitting the variation of ld with P e to aef f P e\u03b1\ngives respectively for the 10% and 70% glycerol solutions\n\u03b1 = 0.52 \u00b1 0.01, aef f \u2243 0.2 mm and \u03b1 = 0.69 \u00b1 0.04,\naef f \u2243 0.04 mm. One observes that aef f and \u03b1 are only\nslightly different for the two solutions despite a ratio of\n20 between the viscosities. One notices that the values\nof ld for a given P\u00e9clet number are much lower for the\ndisordered array than for the periodic one (by a factor\nof 15 (resp. 40 at low (resp. high) P e values). Also, at\nlow P\u00e9clet numbers, ld becomes of the order of the bead\nsize and gets close to the dispersivity observed for the\nDII array.\nAn important feature is the fact that the exponent \u03b1\ncharacterizing the variation of ld with P e is of the order\nof 0.5 (for the 10% solution) and of 0.69 for the other one\n(at slightly higher P\u00e9clet numbers). These exponents are\nintermediate between the values 0.82\u00b10.2 for the periodic\narray and 1 for the empty tube and the value 0 (constant\nld ) for the disordered packing of smaller beads: This implies that the dispersion mechanism is intermediate between Taylor and geometrical dispersion corresponding\nrespectively to the first and second cases. This result\nwas also observed by Baudet et al [17] but remained unexplained.\nAs in the previous sections, visualization on a larger system with the same d/D ratio help understand the dispersion mechanisms. The visualizations of Figure 7a-b show\nthat the dyed fluid is mostly split into two streaks located\nnear the walls. This channelization results from the increase of the porosity near the walls [22]; moreover, the\nlow value of the tube/bead diameter ratio (of the order\nof 1) breaks the angular isotropy of the porous structure and concentrates the flow paths in a few (here 2)\nchannels. Magnico [12] estimated that, at low Reynolds\nnumbers, a fluid layer of thickness of the order of d/4 appears, inside which fluid flow is purely longitudinal and\ntangential with no radial component. At first, one expects therefore radial exchange between the dye streaks,\nclearly visible on Figure 7a, and the remaining pore space\nto be mostly diffusional. Yet, as can be seen of the Figure 7b structural heterogenety resulting from misplaced\nbeads split the streaks into filaments parallel to the mean\nflow [11]; the number of filaments increases then along\nthe flow path and their size decreases. These filaments\n\npersist over distances significantly larger than the bead\ndiameter so that molecular diffusion may spread the filaments over transverse distances of the order of their size.\nThis gives rise to Taylor-like dispersion so that the global\ndispersion results from the combined influences of geometrical and Taylor dispersions. Such an influence of the\nflow channelization on dispersion was recently reported\nby Bruderer et al [10] in 2D networks.\n\nFIG. 7: Views at different times of the miscible displacement\nfront of pure by dyed glycerol in a disordered channel: the\ndiameter of the beads is d = 6 mm and the diameter of the\ntube D = 8 mm. The tube-to-particle ratio is 1.33.\n\nE.\n\nQualitative model of different power law\nvariations\n\nA qualitative argument helps understand how one can\nreach such power law variations of ld \u221d P e\u03b1 (0 < \u03b1 < 1)\nunder the combined influence of the disorder of the flow\nfield and of transverse molecular diffusion. Assume that\nthe front gets divided into streaks of width ax decreasing\nwith the distance x parallel to the flow as ax \u223c d1+\u03b2 x\u2212\u03b2\n(the d term allows to have the right dimensionality for\nthe equation). By generalizing the Taylor argument, the\ntransition to diffusive spreading should occur when the\ntransverse molecular diffusion time \u03c4dif f across the distance ax is of the order of the mean transit time L/U\nwith :\n\u03c4dif f \u223c\n\nx\na2x\n\u223c\nDm\nU\n\n(6)\n\nReplacing ax by its expression provides the distance at\nwhich the transition should take place :\nxtrans \u223c d(\n\nU d 1/(1+2\u03b2)\n)\n\u223c dP e1/(1+2\u03b2)\nDm\n\n(7)\n\nWith, as usual, P e = U d/Dm . As in Taylor dispersion, xtrans , represents the characteristic decorrelation\ndistance of the velocity of tracer particles and we assume\ntherefore that Dk \u223c U xtrans leading to\nDkef f \u223c U dP e1/(1+2\u03b2)\n\n(8)\n\n2+2\u03b2\nDkef f\n\u223c P e 1+2\u03b2\nDm\n\n(9)\n\nor\n\n\f7\nFor \u03b2 = 0 (no geometrical variation of the filament\nwidth with distance), one retrieves Taylor dispersion with\nDkT aylor \u223c a2 U 2 /Dm and for \u03b2 = \u221e (fast decorrelation), one obtains geometrical dispersion with Dkgeom \u223c\ndU (the exponent \u03b1 defined previously should then be\nrelated to \u03b2 by \u03b1 = 1/(1 + 2\u03b2) In the present case, the\nexperimental result Dk \u221d P e3/2 implies that \u03b2 = 1/2.\nTherefore, the experimental observations on DI\u2212 may\nbe accounted for by assuming a combination of the influences of transverse molecular diffusion and of the geometrical disorder of the packing with, for the latter, a rate of\ndivision of the fluid streaks intermediate between those\nobserved in a packing of small beads and in a capillary\ntube.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, despite its simple structure (a long tube\nfilled up with beads), the experimental system studied\nin the present work displayed a broad variety dispersion\nregimes. Both the layout of the beads and the ratio\nof their diameter to that of the tube were shown to\ninfluence very much the dispersion characteristics.\nFirst, Taylor dispersion is observed for a periodic bead\narray inside a tube of slightly larger diameter than the\nbeads, like in the empty tube but with an increased\ndispersion coefficient. With the same beads inside\nthe same tube, but packed in a disordered array, the\ndispersivity ld is very strongly reduced and the exponent\n\u03b1 characterizing the variation of ld with P e decreases\n\n[1] J.

This variation reflects the reduced\npersistence length of fluid streaks as they move along\nthe tube (this length remains however much larger than\nthe bead diameter). A simple model assuming a power\nlaw reduction of the width of the streaks of dye with\ndistance allows to reproduce this variation of ld with\nP e. When the ratio of the tube and particle diameters\nis increased by using beads of smaller diameter, the\ndispersion coefficient varies with the P\u00e9clet number as\nDk \u221d P e for P e > 600. This reflects a geometrical\ndispersion regime with a short persistence of the dye\nstreaks controlled by the local pore geometry and a weak\ninfluence of diffusion in the boundary layers.\nMore observations of the flow and concentration fields\nat the local scale (using for instance matched index\nfluids) are needed to explain quantitatively these results.\nThe increase of the dispersivity for the periodic array\ncompared to the empty tube and the decorrelation of the\nmotions of the fluid particles in the disordered arrays for\nsmall tube/particle diameter ratios are two particularly\nimportant issues.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank J.
