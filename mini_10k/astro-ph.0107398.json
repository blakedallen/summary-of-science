I NTRODUCTION\n\nT\n\nHERE are increasing demands for new semiconductor detectors capable of detecting hard X-ray and \u03b3-rays. For\nimaging devices, their good energy resolution and the ability\nto fabricate compact arrays are very attractive features in comparison with inorganic scintillation detectors coupled to either\nphotodiodes or photomultiplier tubes.\nDespite the excellent energy resolution and charge-transport\nproperties of silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) detectors, their\nlow stopping power for high energy photons limits their application to hard X-ray and \u03b3-ray detection. Furthermore, the small\nband gap of germanium forces us to operate the detector at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, room-temperature semiconductors with high atomic numbers and wide band gaps have long\nbeen under development. These materials are useful not only in\nmedical and industrial imaging systems but also in detectors for\nhigh energy particle- and astrophysics.\nCadmium Telluride (CdTe) has been regarded as a promising semiconductor material for hard X-ray and \u03b3-ray detection\nsince the early 1970's. The high atomic number of the materials gives a high quantum efficiency suitable for a detector operating typically in the 10\u2212500 keV range. A large band-gap\nenergy (Egap = 1.44 eV) allows us to operate these detectors at\nroom temperature. However, it became clear that it would be\nmuch more difficult to use CdTe in comparison with Si and Ge,\nespecially for nuclear spectroscopy, where good spectroscopic\nperformance is desired. The lack of stability also limited the\nusefulness of CdTe detectors in the past. Problems and efforts\nto improve the properties of CdTe detectors since its beginning\nare available in review articles[1], [2].\nManuscript received Febrary 2, 2001.\nT.

Furthermore, advances in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) leads to fabrication of position sensitive\ndetectors in the form of strip or pixellated detectors[4], [5].

Among the range of semiconductor detectors available for \u03b3-ray detection, CdTe (and\nCdZnTe) have a privileged position[6], [7], [8], because of their\nhigh density and the high atomic number of their components,\nas well as a wide bandgap. As shown in Fig. 1 , CdTe has a\nhigh photoelectric attenuation coefficient. Photoelectric absorption is the main process up to 300 keV for CdTe, as compared to\n60 keV for Si and 150 keV for Ge. Fig. 2 shows the efficiency\nfor 100 keV \u03b3-rays. Even a detector with a thickness of 0.5 mm\nprovides a good detection efficiency for \u03b3-rays. Efficiencies calculated with a simulation code [9] are shown in Fig. 3 for a\ndetector with a thickness of 5 mm and 10 mm.

These efficiencies, however, assume that\n\u03b3-ray photons deposit all their energy in the detector volume\nand that we can collect all electron-hole pairs generated in the\ndetector. It has been pointed out that the considerable amount\nof charge loss in CdTe and CdZnTe limits their capability as\nhigh resolution spectrometers[2]. As shown later, this problem\nis due mainly to the poor charge transport properties, especially\nfor holes. Incomplete charge collection could limit the thickness and, thus, the volume of detectors which in turn limits the\nusefulness of the detector.\nA. HPB-grown CdZnTe\nVery recently, Cd1\u2212x Znx Te grown by the High Pressure\nBridgman (HPB) technique has emerged as a new choice for\nroom temperature detectors[10], [11], [12]. By increasing theZn\nconcentration, the bandgap of the material is increased from\n1.44 eV (for CdTe) to 2.2 eV (for ZnTe)[13]. With the most\nwidely used composition of x = 0.08 \u2212 0.15, CdZnTe has a\nbandgap of \u223c 1.6 eV and displays high electrical resistivity \u03c1 =\n(1.0 \u2212 4.0) \u00d7 1010 \u03a9 cm (n-type), which is close to the theoretical maximum allowed by the bandgap[12]. As shown in the\ncurrent voltage (I-V) characteristics (Fig. 4 ), the leakage cur-\n\n1\n\n\u00d7 1 CM\n\nrent of a 4\u00d74\u00d72 mm3 CdZnTe detector is 4 nA at 20 \u25e6 C . The\nlow leakage current due to the high resistivity of HPB-grown\nCdZnTe and its good electron transport of \u03bce \u03c4e = (0.5 \u2212 5.0)\n\u00d710\u22123 cm2 /V, where \u03bc\u03c4 is mobility-lifetime product, results\nin good spectral performance when operated at room temperature. These advantages over conventional CdTe have lead to\nthe early success of small volume single-element planar detectors and simple multi-electrode CdZnTe devices have stimulated\nmore advanced application in a variety of fields[14], [16]. Nevertheless, there are a few drawbacks associated with this new\ndetector material. Although the ingots are of very large volume,\nthe present HPB technique yields only polycrystals with a nonuniform distribution of \u03bc\u03c4 products. The IR transmission image\nof the large wafer shows grain boundaries and a distribution of\nTe-decorated features [17]. Extensive studies indicate that the\ngrain boundaries decorated with Te inclusions or twin boundaries have an adverse effect on carrier transport in CdZnTe and\nresult in poor spectral response[14], [17], [15]. At present, the\nyield of HPB CdZnTe dies suitable for the fabrication of largearea (> 10 \u00d7 10 mm2 ) X- and \u03b3-ray imaging devices is very low\n[14]. Additionally, the \u03bc\u03c4 products of holes in CdZnTe detectors is \u223c2\u00d710\u22125 cm2 /V and is almost one order of magnitude\nsmaller than that of the recent CdTe detector. This is probably\ndue to some degradation in properties introduced by adding Zn.\nB. THM-grown CdTe\nAfter continuous efforts for more than two decades to improve the performance of CdTe crystals, the technique for growing a large single CdTe crystal with good charge transport properties seems to be established[18] CdTe is usually grown by the\nTraveling Heater Method (THM). After careful thermal treatment and the selection of proper crystal orientation for the\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. XX, NO.

The electrical resistivity of \u223c1\u00d7109 \u03a9 cm (p-type) is achieved by compensating the native defects with Cl. Furthermore, with the usual\nelectrode configuration with Pt which forms Ohmic contacts, the\ndetector is free from problems with the stability[18]. There are\nno grain boundaries nor a distribution of Te inclusion in a wafer,\nsince it is a single crystal[17]. The uniform charge transport\nproperties of the wafer are very important aspect not only for\nfabricating large area strip or pixel detectors but also for constructing a large scale \u03b3-ray camera with many individual detectors. Single crystals of 50 mm diameter are now commercially\navailable for THM-CdTe. The grown crystal is large enough\nto obtain (1 1 1)- oriented single crystal wafers with an area\nas large as 30\u00d7 30 mm2 . A similar approach to growing high\nquality CdTe single crystals is reported with THM [19] and in a\nconventional vertical Bridgman furnace[14].\nC. Energy spectra of CdTe and CdZnTe\nBecause of the very high resistivity, CdTe and CdZnTe are\nregarded as semi-insulating materials and usually operated as a\n\"solid ionization chamber\"[23]. The electron-hole pairs generated in the detector are collected by applying an appropriate bias\nvoltage. Figs. 5 (a) and (b) show the energy spectra of \u03b3-rays\nfrom 57 Co obtained at 20 \u25e6 C with the CdTe and CdZnTe detectors used in the measurement of the I-V curve (Fig. 5 ). In the\nmeasurement, the charge signal is integrated in the Clear Pulse\nCP-5102 CSA and shaped by an ORTEC 571 amplifier.

The depth, z is measured from the cathode. The reduction of the pulse height is\nsevere for the event which takes place close to the anode electrode of a 2 mm thick detector, where the signal is mostly due\nto the hole transit. Only 16% of the signal is collected for \u03bch \u03c4h\n= 2\u00d710\u22125 cm2 /V (typical number for the recent HPB-grown\nCdZnTe detectors) as compared to the case for \u03bch \u03c4h = \u221e with\na bias voltage of 300 V. This effect is clearly seen in the 241 Am\nspectrum shown in Fig. 6 which was obtained with a CdZnTe\ndetector with a thickness of 2 mm. When the detector is irradiated by \u03b3-rays from the cathode face, \u03b3-ray peaks are clearly\nresolved. The energy resolution at 60 keV is 3.3 keV. However,\nif we irradiate \u03b3-rays from the anode face, the peak structure\nis smeared out completely. The situation is slightly better for\nCdTe which has higher \u03bch \u03c4h , but the spectral performance is\nstill limited.\nMany methods have been proposed and used to overcome the\nhole-trapping problem. One approach is to use the information\ncontained in the pulse shape[2]. In this approach, the pulses\n\n2\u00d710\u22123\n\nCM 2 /V AND\n\n\u03bch \u03c4h =1\u00d710\u22124\n\nCM 2 /V.\n\nSTATISTICAL FLUCTUATION OF ELECTRON - HOLE PAIRS AND ELECTRONICS\nIS NOT INCLUDED .\n\nwith a slow rise time are corrected or discriminated by means\nof specially designed electronics. A model of the pulse shape is\ndescribed in [21]. Another approach is the use of a hemispheric\ngeometry [2]. A logarithmetic field inside the detector enhances\nthe collection of fast-moving electrons and restrain the hole collection. The application of hemispheric CdTe and CdZnTe detectors to safeguards measurements are described in [22]\nIV. H IGH\n\nRESOLUTION C D T E DIODE AND ITS APPLICATION\nTO THE STACK DETECTOR\n\nThe theoretical energy resolution of CdTe can be calculated\nfrom statistical fluctuations in the number of electron-hole pairs\nand the Fano factor (F )[23]. By using \u01eb = 4.5 eV and F = 0.15,\nthe theoretical limit (FWHM) is 200 eV at 10 keV, 610 eV at\n100 keV, and 1.5 keV at 600 keV [30], if we could neglect electronic noise. These resolutions are very attractive for applications in astrophysics, where precise determinations of the central\nenergy and the profile of X-ray and \u03b3-ray lines are crucial[24].\nFor obtaining the ultimate energy resolution from the CdTe and\nCdZnTe detectors, collecting full information given by the transit of both electrons and holes is important. Fig. 7 is the result\nof simulations showing that high bias voltage is important. In\norder to obtain a FWHM of 700 eV at the 122 keV line from\n57\nCo, a bias voltage of 1400 V should be applied for a detector\nwith a thickness of 0.5 mm for \u03bch \u03c4h = 1 \u00d710\u22124 cm2 /V. The thin\nCdTe device has an advantage over the thick one because sufficient bias voltage for full charge collection can be easily applied.\nDetectors with very low leakage current that allow such a high\nbias voltage have been developed by several groups thorough\nthe use of diode structure either by a blocking electrode or PIN\nstructure[24], [25], [26].\nTakahashi et al. reported a significant improvement in the\nspectral properties of CdTe detectors based on the advances\nmade in the production of high quality CdTe single crystals [24],\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL.

The basic idea is to utilize indium as the anode electrode on the Te-face of the p-type CdTe wafer with (1,1,1) orientation[29]. A high Schottky barrier formed on the In/p-CdTe interface leads us to the operation of the detector as a diode (CdTe\ndiode). The leakage current of the 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm\ndetector was 0.7 nA with a bias voltage of 400 V at 20 \u25e6 C (Fig.\n4).\nFig. 8 shows the energy spectrum of \u03b3-rays from 241 Am obtained with the CdTe diode. A bias voltage of 1400 V (internal\nelectric field of E=28 kV/cm) was applied and the operating\ntemperature was \u221240 \u25e6 C . The FWHM of the 59.5 keV line\nis 0.83 keV corresponding to an energy resolution (\u2206E/E) of\n1.4%. This is close to the energy resolution of HP-Ge detectors\ncooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The reduction of the low\nenergy tail even in the 662 keV line from 137 Cs results in a resolution of 2.1 keV (0.3%), which is consistent with the theoretical\nprediction[30]. The improvement of the energy resolution by\nadopting the Schottky junction is drastic, but the gain and resolution degrade with time during room temperature operation. It\nis reported that both a high electric field of several kV cm\u22121 and\na low operating temperature (below several \u25e6 C ) ensure stability\non time scales longer than weeks[27].\nAn energy resolution of \u2264 1% at a high photon energy of several hundred keV under moderate operating conditions is very\nattractive in high energy astrophysics. However, good energy\nresolution with a thick CdTe diode will be difficult to achieve as\nthe bias voltage required for complete charge collection scales\nwith the second power of the detector thickness. We, therefore,\nadopted the idea of a stacked detector (Fig. 9 ), in which several\nthin CdTe diodes are stacked together and operated as a single\ndetector.\nFig. 10 shows the comparison between the energy spectrum\nof 133 Ba \u03b3-rays obtained from a 2 mm thick planar CdZnTe detector and that from the first four layers of the stack detector\nwhich consists of 12 layers with a thickness of 0.5 mm, both op-\n\n[24].\n\nerated at 5 \u25e6 C . The applied voltages are 300 V for the CdZnTe\ndetector ( E = 1.5 kV/cm ) and 400 V for each layer of the stack\ndetector ( E = 8 kV/cm ). It is clearly shown that the peak to\nvalley ratio at 300 keV is much superior for the stacked CdTe\ndiode as compared to the 2 mm thick CdZnTe detector. This approach is particularly useful for energies below 300 keV, where\nthe dominance of photoelectric attenuation leads to single-site\nabsorption in a single layer. When \u03b3-rays with an energy of 300\nkeV are irradiated onto a 2 mm thick detector, 9% of photons\ndeposit all their energy in the detector. Among them, 75% are\nstopped by a single photoabsorption. For a 6 mm thick detector\n(12 layers), 44% and 17% of the incident photons are stopped\nby a single photoabsorption for 200 keV and 300 keV \u03b3-rays,\nrespectively.\nV. N OVEL E LECTRODE\n\nDESIGN FOR SINGLE CARRIER\nCHARGE COLLECTION\n\nIn order to use CdTe and CdZnTe for the detection of \u03b3-rays\nwith energy higher than several hundred keV, the efficiency of a\nthick (> 5 mm) detector is necessary. However, application of a\nsimple planar electrode configuration seems to be difficult, because the required bias voltage to eliminate low energy tail at the\nlevel to achieve a few keV resolution must be higher than a few\nhundred kV. Soon after the emergence of HPB-grown CdZnTe,\nnew ideas based on the concept of single charge collection have\nbeen proposed[31], [32], [34]. These ideas utilize techniques to\nform strip or pixel electrodes on the surface of the material and\nto process many channels by means of high-density analog LSI\nin the form of ASICs. Here we summarize some highlights of\nthe development of these novel electrode designs.\nA. Coplanar grids\nThe idea of using the effects of Frisch grid found in gas and\nliquid detectors was proposed by Luke in 1994. In this method,\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. XX, NO.

A N ASYMMETRY NOTICED IN THE LINE SHAPE OF\n250 KE V IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT A\nBIAS VOLTAGE OF 400 V IS STILL NOT SUFFICIENT FOR FULL CHARGE\nCOLLECTION .\n\nTHICKNESS OF\n\nTHE STACKED DETECTOR ABOVE\n\nan anode consisting of a pair of interleaved grids (Coplanar grid)\nis formed on a surface of the detector, as shown in Fig. 11 . A\ndifferent bias is applied to each set of electrodes. This potential difference is small compared to the overall potential across\nthe detector. When electrons and holes move within the bulk\nmaterial of the detector, they induce equal signals on both grid\nelectrodes. When the electrons come close to the anode plane,\nthe signal of the grid with the higher potential rises steeply. A\nnet signal, which is obtained by subtracting the signals from the\ntwo grids, is sensitive to primarily to the electron signal (single\npolarity charge sensing). Since the depth dependent signal due\nto the movement of holes is subtracted, the low energy tail in the\nspectrum can be eliminated. The dramatic improvement by the\ncoplanar grid is demonstrated in Fig. 12 [35].\n\nFig. 12\nS PECTRA OF 137 C S OBTAINED WITH THE C D Z N T E DETECTOR ( A ) IN ITS\nSTANDARD CONFIGURATION AND ( B ) IN THE COPLANAR GRID\nCONFIGURATION .

XX, NO. Y, MONTH 2000\n\n106\n\nB. Small pixels and control electrode\nIt has long been recognized that reducing the size of the electrode collecting the higher \u03bc\u03c4 carriers can potentially eliminate\nthe low-energy tail by effectively achieving single-carrier charge\ncollection through the \"near-field effect\". Barret et al have\nshown that, if the pixel size is small in comparison with the detector thickness and the pixel electrode is biased to collect electrons, the incomplete charge collection due to severe hole trapping can be dramatically improved, because the induced charge\non each pixel anode is dominated by the number of electrons\ncollected by the anode[32]. For nuclear medicine applications,\nBarber et al. applied the idea of \"small pixel effects\" to a large\nCdZnTe array with a pixellated electrode produced on one side\nof the detector slab by photolithography that is bump bonded to\na readout integrated circuit which reads out each pixel individually[33]. A 64\u00d764 (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm) CdZnTe arrays with 380\n\u03bcm pitch has been constructed and tested by Barber et al. [50].\nPixel detectors with a pixel size of several hundred to a few mm\nhave been developed by several groups. Optimum spectroscopic\nperformance with electrode segmentation is discussed in [36].\nRecently, Butler has proposed a new concept based on a control electrode in addition to a cathode and small anode[34]. The\ncontrol electrode surrounds the anode pixel and accepts a large\nfraction of the charges induced by the carriers while they are\nin transit. Similar to the effect of a coplanar grid, almost the\nfull charge of the mobile electrons is induced on the anode.\nMayer et al. extended this concept and developed an imaging\ndevice with orthogonal coplanar anodes (Fig. 13 )[37]. The signals induced on the strips are used to determine the interaction\nposition in one dimension. The position information in the ydirection is inferred from the pixels which are interconnected to\nthe strips. This electrode configuration provides information of\nn2 pixels with 2n channels and reduces the complexity of the\nreadout electronics. The energy resolution (FWHM) obtained\nfrom the detector is 3.42 keV at 60 keV and 5.6 keV at 662 keV.\nC. 3-D position sensitive semiconductor detector\nIn addition to signals from strips or pixels formed on the\nanode face, information from the cathode (common electrode)\ncan be used to obtain the \u03b3-ray interaction depth. The interaction depth provide a correction for the electron path length\nand the trapping which are important for thick detectors (\u223c 1\ncm). He et al. have performed extensive studies on this possibility[38], [39]. The fist 3-D position-sensitive semiconductor\ndetector with CdZnTe yielded an energy resolution of 10 keV at\n662 keV and a depth resolution of 0.5 mm. Results from a second generation 12.5\u00d712.5\u00d710 mm3 CdTe detector are reported\nin [40].\nVI. A PPLICATION\n\nTO\n\nH ARD X- RAY\n\nAND\n\n\u03b3- RAY\n\nMISSION\n\nHard X-rays and \u03b3-rays are an important frequency window\nfor expoloring the energetic universe. The CGRO satellite has\nrevealed us the fact that a variety of gamma-ray sources exist\nin the sky[41]. However, when compared with X-ray Astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy is still immature; the sensitivity of\ninstruments are far from the level achieved by the current X-ray\nmissions employing focusing telescopes in the energy band be-\n\nFig. 13\nT HE ANODE GEOMETRY OF A C D Z N T E IMAGING DETECTOR WITH\nCOPLANAR GRID AND CONTROL ELECTRODE . T HE VERTICAL STRIPS\nMEASURE THE x- POSITION WHILE THE LINES OF INTERCONNECTED PIXEL\nPROVIDES THE y- MEASUREMENT [37]\n\nlow 10 keV. Gamma-ray instruments in the 21st century should\nprovide much improved angular and spectral resolution over the\ninstruments in use today. Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) and Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) solid state detectors have several\npromising features which make them instruments for use as a focal plane imager of a multi-layer grazing incidence mirror or a\ncoded mask aperture for the next generation of hard X-ray and\n\u03b3-ray astronomy satellites.\nA. INTEGRAL\nThe IBIS detector on board ESA's INTEGRAL will be the\nfirst space instrument that utilizes the good spectral resolution\nof CdTe. Major objectives of the mission are the detection and\nprecise identification of \u03b3-ray line spectra to study the high energy processes and resulting nuclear interactions taking place at\nastrophysical sites. The detector consists of two layers of pixellated detector planes separated \u223c10 cm and operated as a focal\nplane detector of a coded mask aperture. The top layer detector\nplane is made of 16384 square CdTe detectors (4\u00d74\u00d72 mm3 )\n, which gives a total sensitive area of 2621 cm2 . The detector\nis divided into eight rectangular modules of 128 polycells, each\npolycell containing 16 detector pixels. In order to improve the\nenergy resolution of the CdTe detector, a pulse height correction\nscheme is implemented by a specially designed ASIC. According to the measurement of a prototype detector for IBIS[42],\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. XX, NO.

Swift\nSwift is a first of its kind multiwavelength transient observatory for \u03b3-ray burst (GRB) astronomy, due to be launched in\n2003. The BAT instrument on Swift is designed to provide the\ncritical GRB trigger and quickly measure the burst position to\nbetter than 4 arcmin[43], [44]. Since the energy emission from\nGRBs peaks at a few 100 keV, the BAT utilizes 32768 CdZnTe\ndetector with dimensions of 4\u00d74\u00d72 mm3 to form a 1.2 m \u00d7 0.6\nm sensitive area in the detector plane. There are 256 detector\nmodule (DM) in the BAT. One DM consists of 8\u00d716 array of\nCdZnTe elements, which are connected to a 128 channel readout ASIC (XA chip [45]).\nC. Future Approach\nFor future X-ray astronomy missions, one of the main objectives is observation with a very high sensitivity in the 10-100\nkeV band, where non-thermal emission becomes dominant over\nthermal emission[24]. This could be achieved by employing a\nmulti-layer, grazing incidence hard X-ray telescope (\"super mirror\") in conjunction with a hard X-ray imaging detector as a focal plane detector. The current goal for the imaging detector is a\nCdTe or CdZnTe pixel detector with both a fine position resolution of a few 100 \u03bcm and a high energy resolution better than 1\nkeV (FWHM) in this energy range. In order to cover the field of\nview of the telescope, the detector should have an area of several cm2 . Fast timing of several hundred ns will be required for\nthe active shielding, which would be necessary to achieve a low\nbackground environment in space.\n\n107\n\nFig. 15\nR ADIOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF AN OBJECT MADE OF SOLDERING WIRE\nIRRADIATED BY \u03b3- RAYS FROM 241 A M OBTAINED WITH THE 32\u00d732 C D T E\nPIXEL DETECTOR COVERING 6.8 MM \u00d7 6.8 MM AT ROOM TEMPERATURE .\nT HE PIXEL SIZE IS 200 \u03bcM \u00d7 200 \u03bcM .\n\nResearch and development projects toward these goals are\nnow under way by several groups[17], [46], [30], [47]. To realize fine pitch (finer than several hundred microns) CdTe and/or\nCdZnTe pixel detectors, good detector material and low noise\namplifiers and a readout system for more than 10,000 independent channels will be the key technology. A simple and robust\nconnection technology needs to be established, because high\ncompression and/or high ambient temperature would damage\nthe CdTe and CdZnTe crystal. Fig. 15 shows the radiograpic image obtained with fine pixel detectors developed under the collaboration between Bonn Universty and ISAS[48] . The size of\nthe pixels is 200\u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm. They are directly bump bonded\nto a two-dimensional photon counting ASIC (MPEC2) by using\nnewly developed gold-stud bump bonding technology[30].\nIn addition to pixel detectors, a large area array (\u223c 5000 cm2 )\nconsisting of strips has been reported in [49]. The detector is a\n6\u00d76 array of CdZnTe strip detectors. Orthogonal patterns are\nimprinted on the top and bottom sides of each detector. With\nstrips separated by 100 \u03bcm, a spatial resolution of < 50 \u03bcm has\nbeen demonstrated.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nOwing to the significant progress in producing high quality\nCdZnTe and CdTe crystals, these materials are now regarded as\n\"serious\" candidates for the next generation of hard X-ray and\n\u03b3-ray detectors. Applications to nuclear medicine are reviewd\nin [50], [6], [16]. Good energy resolution better than 1 keV is\nachieved for 60 keV \u03b3-rays by the diode structure for a thin detector. A novel electrode configuration solves the problem of\nincomplete charge collection for the detection of high energy \u03b3rays with a thick detector. As discussed by Fougeres et al. [19],\nthe choice between CdTe and CdZnTe is still very difficult to\nmake. There is still some room for improvements for real ap-\n\n\fIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. XX, NO. Y, MONTH 2000\n\nplications. These include the production of large and uniform\nsingle crystals, especially for the HPB-grown CdZnTe, and the\nbump technology specific to \"fragile\" CdTe and CdZnTe. The\ncost of the material is still high for a large scale \u03b3-camera. Further advances in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)\nare necessary for the fabrication of fine-pitch pixel detectors.\nExtensive studies currently underway by many laboratories will\nboost the further advances of of these interesting materials .\nVIII.
