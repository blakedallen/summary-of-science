At a similar time, the field of fractional\nstatistics, founded in the work by Leinaas and Myrheim2 ,\nattained broad attention due to the work by Wilczek in\n19823,4 . In strongly-correlated many-body systems, the\nphenomenon of fractionalization, where the elementary\nexcitations of the system carry only a fraction of the\nquantum numbers of the constituents, has become known\nto occur in a variety of cases.\nThe first physical system in which fractional excitations and the associated fractional statistics have been\ndiscussed on a unified footing is the fractional quantum\nHall effect5,6,7 (FQHE). There, the quantum statistics of\nthe anyonic quasiparticles can be understood in terms of\na generalized Berry's phase8 , which is acquired by the\nwave function as quasiparticles wind around each other.\nThis is a sensible concept in two dimensions only where\none can uniquely define a winding number for the braiding. In the FQHE, the fractional statistics is known to\noccur in the presence of a magnetic field violating parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry. In recent years,\nthere have been tremendous efforts to study the fractional excitations of the FQHE experimentally in order\nto confirm the prediction from theory and to validate\nfractional statistics as a concept being realized in nature.\nThis, however, has remained inconclusive in certain aspects and thus is still a subject of current discussion and\nwork9,10,11,12,13 .\nLater, the concept of fractional statistics has been\nfound to occur in one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnets, where it can be defined in terms of a generalized Pauli principle obeyed by the excitations14 and,\nas shown recently, by a phase the wave function acquires\nwhen two spinons move through each other15 . The fractional charge of the quasiparticles in the FQHE corresponds to the spin 1/2 of the elementary spinon excita-\n\ntions in these systems, which is fractional as the Hilbert\nspace is built up by spin flips which carry spin 1. As\none-dimensional systems are amenable to a host of exact\nmethods, many exactly solvable models exhibiting this\nbehavior exist16,17,18,19 . In particular, various properties\nof fractional excitations in spin chains have been observed\nexperimentally20,21,22 .\nIn general, it appears to be that P and T violation is\nintimately related to the occurrence of excitations obeying fractional statistics in two dimensions, which both\napplies to quasiparticles in the FQHE and spinons in a\nquantum antiferromagnet. These symmetries may be explicitly broken as in the FQHE or generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking. For two-dimensional antiferromagnets, the concept of fractional excitations is less\nestablished than for the one-dimensional case23 . In particular, finding solvable theoretical models in which the\nphenomenon occurs has been one predominant area of\nresearch in the field. Significant progress has been accomplished for dimer models24,25 .\nIn addition to important questions with regard to\nthe general principle underlying fractional statistics,\ntwo-dimensional spin liquids are of special interest\nwith regard to investigation of the hypothesized link\nbetween fractionalization and high-Tc superconductivity26,27 . Moreover, in many systems where fractionalization occurs, there is the ambition to use the topological degeneracy contained in these systems for quantum\ncomputing, where topological information can serve as\na quantum bit with negligibly small local decoherence\nrates28 .\nThe paradigmatic state for a S = 1/2 spin liquid is\nthe chiral spin liquid (CSL) introduced by Kalmeyer and\nLaughlin29,30 , which is constructed to spontaneously violate the symmetries P and T, and can be defined on any\nregular lattice including both bipartite and non-bipartite\nlattices. The universality class of chiral spin liquid states,\nand in particular the order parameter and the topological\ndegeneracy31, was defined by Wen, Wilczek, and Zee32 .\nA CSL state has also been constructed by Yao and Kivelson33 in the Kitaev model34 on a Fisher lattice, i.e., a\nhoneycomb lattice of triangles. Recently, a family of non-\n\n\fAbelian CSL states35 has been proposed for general spin\nS, whose wave functions correspond to the bosonic ReadRezayi series of FQH states36 . The non-Abelian statistics\nof the spinons has even been conjectured to be a general\nproperty of spin S antiferromagnets35.\nAs in the one-dimensional case mentioned above, the\nspinons in the CSL exhibit quantum-number fractionalization and carry only half the spin of the bosonic spin excitations in conventional magnetically-ordered systems,\nwhich carry spin 1. Whereas the spinon appears to\nbe the fundamental field describing excitations in twodimensional S = 1/2 antiferromagnets in general, an\neffective description by magnon-like excitations proved\nrather adequate for the generic model. The reason for\nthis is that the confinement between the spinons is generically so strong that the underlying excitation structure is\nmostly suppressed. In the CSL, however, the spinons are\ndeconfined. The model is hence ideally suited to study\nfractional quantization of spinons in two-dimensional antiferromagnets. In spite of its promising properties, for\nnearly two decades since its emergence, the CSL lacked\na microscopic model where it is realized.\nIn this article, we develop an analytical method for the\nconstruction of parent Hamiltonians for the CSL. The\nmethod relies explicitly on the singlet property of the\nCSL, as this allows for a spherical tensor decomposition\nof the destruction operator we introduce. From different tensor components, we construct two different parent\nHamiltonians, which annihilate the CSL and hence have\nit as a zero-energy ground state. One of the Hamiltonians has been presented in a Letter previously37 ; both\nHamiltonians contain 6-body interactions. One of the\nkey issues we address here is whether the CSL is the only\nground state of these Hamiltonians. To answer this question, we perform exact diagonalization studies of both\nmodels for a 16-site square lattice. In particular, we\nintroduce an adapted Kernel sweeping method, which\nallows for an efficient numerical implementation of the\ncomplex and technically cumbersome Hamiltonians we\ninvestigate. We find that the model we introduced previously has indeed the CSL as its (modulo the two-fold\ntopological degeneracy) unique ground state. For the\nother Hamiltonian we present, however, we find that the\nCSL is not the unique ground state. Hence only the former model is useful for further analysis of e.g. the spinon\nspectrum.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we\nreview the chiral spin liquid ground state and its basic properties. After outlining the general construction\nscheme for the Hamiltonians in Section III, we formulate a destruction operator for the CSL state in Section IV and exploit the spin rotational invariance of the\nCSL state to decompose the destruction operator into its\nspherical tensor components, which annihilate the CSL\nstate individually. The proof that the destruction operator annihilates the CSL ground state is given in Section V. In Section VI, we introduce a Kernel sweeping\nmethod to compute the CSL Hamiltonians. We present\n\nL\n\nL\nFIG. 1: The model is defined on a square lattice length L on\na side such that the total number of sites is given by N =\nL2 . The image shows the lattice for N = 16.

The numerical results obtained\nwith this method are discussed in Section VII. We conclude this work with a summary in Section VIII.\nII.\n\nCHIRAL SPIN LIQUID\n\nThe CSL was originally conceived by D.H. Lee as a spin\nliquid constructed by condensing the bosonic spin flip\noperators on a two-dimensional lattice into a FQH liquid\nat Landau level filling factor \u03bd = 1/2. The ground state\nwave function for a circular droplet with open boundary\nconditions, on a square lattice with lattice constant of\nlength one, is given by29,30\nhz1 * * * zM |\u03c8i =\n\nM\nY\n\nj<k\n\n2\n\n(zj \u2212 zk )\n\nM\nY\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\nG(zj ) e\u2212 2 |zj | , (1)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere M = N/2. The z's in the above expression are\nthe complex positions of the up-spins on the lattice: z =\nx + iy, with x and y integer. G(z) = (\u22121)(x+1)(y+1) is a\ngauge factor, which ensures that (1) is a spin singlet (see\nFig. 1). Lattice sites not occupied by z's correspond to\ndown-spins.\nFor our purposes, it is propitious to choose periodic\nboundary conditions (PBCs) with equal periods L1 =\nL2 = L, L even, and with N = L2 sites. Following\nHaldane and Rezayi38 , the wave function for the CSL\nthen takes the form\nhz1 * * * zM |\u03c8i =\n*\n2\n\n2\nY\n\n\u03bd=1\nM\nY\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b81\n\n\u0010\u03c0\n\nL\n\n[Z \u2212 Z\u03bd ]\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\nM\n\u0011Y\n\nj<k\n\n2\n\nG(zj ) e 2 (zj \u2212|zj | ) ,\n\n\u03b81\n\n\u0010\u03c0\n\nL\n\n[zj \u2212 zk ]\n\n\u00112\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u03b81 (w) = \u2212\u03b81 (\u2212w) \u2261 \u03b81 (w|e\u2212\u03c0 ) is the odd Ja39\ncobi theta function\nP . The zeros for the center-of-mass\ncoordinate Z =\nj zj must lie in the principal region\n0 \u2264 Re(Z1 ) < L, 0 \u2264 Im(Z1 ) < L and satisfy Z1 + Z2 =\nL + iL; the freedom to choose Z1 reflects the topological\ndegeneracy and yields two linearly-independent ground\nstates for the CSL. These states are spin singlets, are\ninvariant under lattice translations, and are strictly periodic with regard to the PBCs.\nIII.\n\nfor the rank-3 spherical tensor operators. Either Hamiltonian is a scalar and is translationally invariant, both\nof these properties guaranteed by the construction. Additionally, since the Hamiltonians are positive semidefinite, the chiral spin liquid is a ground state of the\nmodel. It should be noted that these models are not\nthemselves unique as one could include any coefficients\nJij into the sums of Eqs. 3 and 4 and remove the restriction that only nearest-neighbor sites are summed over.\nThese two models do, however, represent the simplest\nmodels from each class.\nIn Section VI, a numerical method is developed for\nperforming the exact diagonalization of these Hamiltonians that can handle the large number of interactions\nefficiently. This method is used in Section VII to show\nthat the model given by Eq. 3 has exactly two ground\nstates, as expected due to the topological degeneracy of\nthe chiral spin liquid on a torus, and that these states\nare precisely the chiral spin liquid ground states given\nin Section II above. Adopting the same procedure, the\nHamiltonian given in Eq. 4 is shown to have a larger\nground-state manifold which is not exhausted by the chiral spin liquid ground states.\n\nGENERAL METHOD\n\nIn order to construct a parent Hamiltonian for the chiral spin liquid, one first derives the destruction operators\nfor the ground state. In our formulation, the destruction operators are constructed from a set of operators \u03c9j\nwhere j = 1, . . . , N indexes the lattice sites. The operators \u03c9j , to be introduced in Section IV below, are not\nthemselves destruction operators, but have the property\nthat, acting on the ground state, they produce a result\nindependent of the site index j: \u03c9i |\u03c8i = \u03c9j |\u03c8i. Therefore, once the above result is established in Section V, it\nfollows that the difference of any two of the operators is a\ndestruction operator for the ground state: dij = \u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9j .\nIn order to construct a sensible parent Hamiltonian,\none must minimally demand that it be a translationallyinvariant scalar operator. In order to put the Hamiltonian in this form, it is shown in Appendix A that the\noperators may be written as \u03c9j = \u03a90j + \u27350j where \u03a9j\nand \u2735j are vector and third-rank spherical tensor operators respectively and where the 0 superscript indicates\nthe component in spherical notation. The operators \u03a9j\nand \u2735j are given explicitly in terms of spin operators in\nSections IV A and IV B.\nAs is discussed in detail in Section IV, the WignerEckhart theorem guarantees that all components of the\noperators Dij = \u03a9i \u2212 \u03a9j as well as Dij = \u2735i \u2212 \u2735j are\ndestruction operators for the chiral spin liquid ground\nstate so long as the reducible tensor operator dij is. One\ncan then construct Hamiltonians based on either set of\noperators:\nX \u2020\nDij * Dij\n(3)\nH=\n\nIV.\n\nThe Hamiltonian which stabilizes the chiral spin liquid\nis generated by first finding a set of operators \u03c9i , where\ni is a site index. These operators are not themselves\ndestruction operators, but the bond operators \u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9j ,\nwhere i and j are any two distinct sites, will be shown\nto destroy the CSL ground state. The operators may be\nwritten as \u03c9j = \u03c9j+ \u2212 \u03c9j\u2212 where \u03c9j+ = Tj + Vj and\n\nVj\n\nhi ji \u03bd=\u22123\n\n\u03c9j =\n\n\u03bd\nDij\n\n\u2032\nX\n\ni k6=j\n\n\u0001\u2020\n\n\u03bd\nDij\n\nKijk\n\n\u0014\n\n(6)\n\nThe two sets of coefficients Uij and Kijk are defined in\nSection IV C below and the prime on the sum indicates\nthat one must exclude the coincidences of i and k.\nThe operator \u03c9j\u2212 is related to \u03c9j+ by a \u03c0/2 rotation\nabout the x-axis that maps Sz and Sy into \u2212Sz and \u2212Sy .\nThis means that the entire operator \u03c9j is given by\n\n(4)\n\n\u0015 X\n1\nz\nz\nz z z\n(Sj \u00d7 Sk ) +(Sj * Sk ) Si \u2212 Si Sj Sk +\nUij Siz .\n2i\n\nIn writing down Eq. 7, the fact that\n\n(5)\n\ni6=j\n\nfor the vector destruction operators or\n3\nX X\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\n1 X\n1\n+ Siz\nKijk Sj+ Sk\u2212\n2\n2\ni k6=j\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n1\n1\nz\nz\n=\nUij\n+ Si\n+ Sj .\n2\n2\n\nTj =\n\nhi ji\n\nH=\n\nANNIHILATION OPERATOR FOR THE\nCHIRAL SPIN LIQUID\n\n(7)\n\ni6=j\n\nP\n\ni6=j\n\nUij = 0,\n\nhas been employed.

While the operators \u03c9i are not themselves destruction operators for the CSL ground state, it\nwill be shown in Section V that dij = \u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9j is a destruction operator for the ground state for any choice of\ni and j.\nThe operators \u03c9j are reducible and can be decomposed\ninto irreducible tensor operators, in this case of ranks 1\nand 3. From Eq. 7 it is clear that every term except for\nthe Siz Sjz Skz term is the 0 (or z) component of a rank-1\n(vector) operator. This final term can be decomposed\ninto rank-3 and vector components.\nIt is straightforward to show that if an operator d is a\ndestruction operator for the CSL ground state, then each\nof its irreducible components are as well. This is because\nthe Wigner-Eckhart theorem tells us that acting with an\nj\noperator Tm\non a state |n q mq i with angular momentum\nq and z-component mq gives\nX\nj\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\nmq m\u2032\nTm\n|n q mq i =\n(8)\nCm\nj q j \u2032 |n j m i ,\n\nj\n\nand noting that states with different values of j are necessarily orthogonal, it immediately follows that each of the\nstates in the sum are themselves zero and hence the operators T j are destruction operators for the ground state.\nIn Sections IV A and IV B we give two classes of operators that are obtained from the reducible tensor operator\n\u03c9j in Eq. 7.\n\nA.\n\nAs shown in Appendix A, the operator Siz Sjz Skz may\nbe written as the sum of the 0-components of a vector\nand a third-rank tensor. The vector component is given\nby\n\nj \u2032 m\u2032\n\nwhere n and n\u2032 are any quantum numbers other than\nangular momentum. Since the CSL is a spin singlet:\nq = mq = 0, it follows that there is only a single nonzero term in the above sum corresponding to j \u2032 = j and\nm\u2032 = m. This means that by decomposing the destruction operator for the ground state d into its tensor com-\n\n\u03a9j =\n\n\u2032\nX\n\ni,k6=j\n\nKijk\n\n\u0014\n\nVector destruction operator\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n(Si * Sj ) Skz +(Sj * Sk ) Siz +(Sk * Si ) Sjz\n5\n\n(10)\n\nand, working from Eq. 7, the vector operator \u03a9j is given\nby\n\n\u0015 X\n4\n1\n1\n1\nUij Si .\n(Sj \u00d7 Sk ) + (Sj * Sk ) Si \u2212 (Sk * Si ) Sj \u2212 (Si * Sj ) Sk +\n2i\n5\n5\n5\n\n(11)\n\ni6=j\n\nSince \u03a9i \u2212 \u03a9j is a destruction operator for the ground\nstate, it immediately follows that one may construct a\nHamiltonian for which the chiral spin liquid is the exact\nground state as\nX\n\u2020\n(\u03a9i \u2212 \u03a9j ) *(\u03a9i \u2212 \u03a9j ) ,\n(12)\nH=\n\npositive semi-definiteness in H) in constructing a parent\nHamiltonian for the CSL.\n\nwhere the sum runs over all nearest-neighbors on the lattice.

Rather,\none can consider any combination of bond-operators (including arbitrary coefficients so long as one maintains\n\nIt is also possible to create a set of third-rank tensor\ndestruction operators. As shown in Appendix A, the\noperator Siz Sjz Skz may be fully decomposed into the 0components of a vector operator (given in Eq. 10) and a\nthird-rank tensor operator, which is necessarily just the\ndifference between Siz Sjz Skz and the operator in Eq. 10.\nThis gives a destruction operator whose 0-component is\n\nB.\n\nTensor destruction operator\n\nhi ji\n\n\u2032\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 X\n\u27350j = \u2212 \u221a\nKijk (Si * Sj ) Skz +(Sj * Sk ) Siz +(Sk * Si ) Sjz \u2212 5 Siz Sjz Skz .\n10 i,k6=j\n\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\fThe other components are straightforward to obtain (see\nAppendix A) and one may again use these operators to\nform a Hamiltonian for the chiral spin liquid according\nto\nH=\n\n3\nX X\n\nhi ji \u03bd=\u22123\n\n\u2735\u03bdi \u2212 \u2735\u03bdj\n\n\u0001\u2020\n\n\u0001\n\u2735\u03bdi \u2212 \u2735\u03bdj .\n\nC.\n\nCoefficients\n\nThe coefficients appearing in Eq. 7 are functions of\nthe distance between the sites of the form Kijk =\nK(zk \u2212 zj , zi \u2212 zj ) where\n\n(14)\n\nK(x, y) =\n\nThe Hamiltonian in Eq. 14 has two significant advantages\nover the model in Eq. 12: it depends only on one set of\ncoefficients (Kijk but not Uij ) and, because the operator\nin the sum in Eq. 13 is symmetric under interchange of i\nand k, one may replace Kijk by Aijk = (Kijk + Kkji ) /2\nwhere the new coefficients are manifestly symmetric in\ninterchange of the first and third indices.

The only requirements are that\nit be a periodic function of y, fall off faster than 1/x\nwith increasing x, and be analytic apart from first-order\npoles that occur at the coincidence of the two arguments:\nx = y. It is straightforward to show thatPU (z) is an odd\nfunction; this in turn guarantees that i Uij = 0 and\nlets this sum be dropped, as was done in writing down\nEq. 7.\n\n(20)\n\nwhere f (Z) is a function only of the center of mass: Z =\nPM\ni=1 zi .

To see this, recall that one can write \u03c9j\u2212 =\nU \u03c9j+ U \u2020 where U performs the \u03c0/2 rotation about the\nx-axis as discussed in Section IV above. The CSL ground\n5\n\n\fand since L is even it follows that the sum of Z and W is\nequivalent to a translation of the lattice z0 . Because the\nfunction f (Z) is periodic and odd, both properties will\nbe shown below, it immediately follows that f (W) =\nf (z0 \u2212 Z) = \u2212f (Z). Combining this fact with Eq. 23\ncompletes the proof that Eq. 21 entails Eq. 20.\n\nstate is invariant under such a rotation so that\nhz1 * * * zM | \u03c9j+ |\u03c8i = hz1 * * * zM | U \u2020 \u03c9j\u2212 U |\u03c8i\n= hw1 * * * wM | \u03c9j\u2212 |\u03c8i ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere {wi }, the locations of the down spins on the lattice,\nis the complement of {zi }.

For microscopic models containing many-body interactions, one must be very efficient if one hopes to write down the Hamiltonian in a\nreasonable amount of time. For our Hamiltonians, this\nis because there are, even for a lattice with only N = 16\nsites, literally thousands of terms in the Hamiltonian corresponding to all the different ways to choose six sites out\nof sixteen. In contrast, a model with only two-site interactions on the same lattice would only have 15 terms to\n\nAction of Vj\n\nThe action of the operator Vj on the CSL ground state\nis straightforward to compute. Proceeding in an analogous manner, we have\nhz1 * * * zM | Vj |\u03c8i =\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\nX\n1\n1\n+ Siz\n+ Sjz |\u03c8i .

In this section,\nwe describe an algorithm for calculating the Hamiltonian\nvery efficiently, called the kernel sweeping method.\nAs an example to illustrate the kernel sweeping method, we will consider the computation of a\nHeisenberg-type Hamiltonian such as\nX\nJij Si * Sj .\n(39)\nH=\n\nwhere, since we are dealing with a Hermitian operator, we\nonly need to include the upper triangle. The extension\nof this array to a p-site operator is straightforward; in\nthat case one must consider the action of the operator\non a 2p -dimensional basis. Therefore, the corresponding\noperator for the chiral spin liquid Hamiltonian given in\nEquation 12 is 64-dimensional.\nThe code next loops over all possible values of i and j\nand does the following. First it computes\n\nij\n\nRij =\n\nWe work in an S z basis and label the states by a binary\nnumber where up-spins are treated as 1's and down-spins\nare treated as 0's. We first note that since this is a twosite interaction, in order to implement this model all we\nreally need to know is how the operator Si * Sj acts on\nthe four-dimensional basis |si sj i. This action may be\nsummarized as\nh\u2193\u2193| h\u2193\u2191| h\u2191\u2193| h\u2191\u2191|\n1/4\n0\n0\n0\n0 \u22121/4 1/2\n0\n0\n1/2 \u22121/4 0\n0\n0\n0\n1/4\n\nAll this means is to compute the contribution of the two\nspins at sites i and j to the binary number that will label\nthe entire state. For our example, assuming that we are\nat a point in the loop where i = 3 and j = 7, this gives\nR37 =\n\n|\u2193\u2193i\n|\u2193\u2191i\n|\u2191\u2193i\n|\u2191\u2191i\n\n(40)\n\n\b\u0002\n\nJ37 \u0002 6 2 \u0003\nJ37\nJ37 \u0002 6 6 \u0003\n, 2 ,2 \u2192 \u2212\n, 2 ,2 \u2192\n,\n4\n4\n2\n\u001b\n\u0002 2 2\u0003\n\u0003\nJ37 \u0002 2\nJ37\n2 ,2 \u2192 \u2212\n.(44)\n, 2 + 26 , 22 + 26 \u2192\n4\n4\n[0, 0] \u2192\n\n(41)\n\nBij =\n\n\uf8f1\nN\n\uf8f2X\n\uf8f3\n\nwhere the {s}m and the {s}n are a binary shorthand for\nthe states in this two-dimensional basis and \u03a9mn are the\nelements in the matrix.

The implementation of the tensor\nHamilton operator Eq. 14 is completely analogous.\n\nVII.\n\n0\n\u0393\n\nUsing the method outlined in Section VI above, the\nmodels in Eq. 12 and Eq. 14 have been solved by exact\ndiagonalization on 16-site lattices with periodic boundary\nconditions. We start by considering the vector Hamiltonian given by Eq. 12. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 3;\nthe points in the Brillouin zone which label the axis of\nthis figure are shown in Fig. 2. We find the spectrum to\nbe positive semi-definite, with a doubly-degenerate zeroenergy state at the \u0393 point. The rest of the spectrum\nis well separated from the ground state by a gap that is\n\n\u0393\n\nK\n\n\u2206\n\nK\n\nM\n\n\u03a3\n\nsubstantial and we believe not due to finite size effects in\nthe calculation. This claim is based on the fact that it\nexceeds the finite size level splitting of the spectrum by a\nfactor of \u223c 15. The presence of a gap is expected between\nthe chiral spin liquid ground state and what should be a\ntwo-spinon excited state. The spinon excitations of this\nmodel will be addressed in future work.\nWe now discuss the two orthogonal zero-energy eigenstates. For comparison, we construct the CSL state Eq. 2\nexplicitly and find a two-dimensional subspace of functions with the center of mass variable being treated as\nan external parameter. We have computed the overlap\nof the Hamiltonian ground state subspace and the CSL\nsubspace and find that they match perfectly. Therefore,\nthe ground state of this Hamiltonian is indeed the twofold degenerate CSL state. Additionally, we have only\ntwo zero-energy states, by which follows that the CSL\nstate is the only ground state of the model, a statement\nwhich cannot be achieved analytically.\nFor the tensor Hamiltonian, however, we find that\nthe zero-energy subspace is massively degenerate. It of\ncourse contains the CSL, in accord with the analytical\nproof, but also many additional states. While the restriction to small system sizes prevents us from studying the\nthermodynamic limit precisely, our numerical findings indicate that the Hamiltonian Eq. 14 does not stabilize the\n\nM\n\n\u03a3\n\nX\n\nFIG. 3: Low energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian Eq. 12,\nscaled down to order of unity.

We write these irreducible operators as Tm\n; q and\nm correspond to angular momentum and\nits\nz\ncompoP\nnent respectively.

We have\ncomputed the spectra of the Hamiltonians by use of a\nKernel-sweeping method in exact diagonalization. There,\nfor the Hamiltonian operator composed of the spherical\nvector component of the CSL destruction operator, we\nobserve that the CSL states are the only ground states\nof the model. We conclude that this model is a promising\ncandidate to also study the elementary excitations of the\nmodel, i.e., spinons, and many other questions in the field\nof two-dimensional fractionalization of quantum numbers\nin spin systems.\n\nThe operator in Eq. 7 that is not manifestly the component of a vector is Siz Sjz Skz , which is a component of\na third-rank Cartesian tensor. In order to keep the notation manageable, we start by considering the direct product of two operators U and V with angular momentum\nj1 and j2 respectively.
