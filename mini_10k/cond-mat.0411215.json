In order to simplify things, we restri t\n(\u03bb)\nour dis ussion to the ontribution of the singly-ex ited on\u001cgurations |\u03a60 (n \u2192 \u03b1)i, although in our al ulations\nNoteworthy point is that the o\n\nall possible ex itations needed to\n\nompute both one- and two-body in rements have been\n\nonsidered (see dis ussion\n\nbelow). Thus, the expe tation value of the dipole operator for a singly ex ited many-body wave fun tion (assuming\n(\u03bb)\nthat |\u03a80 i is real) is\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)2\n\nh\u03a80 |Re |\u03a80 i\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n= N C0 hri0 +\nX\n\u221a\n(\u03bb) (\u03bb)\nCn;\u03b1\nC0 h\u03b1|r|n(o)i(\u03bb) + * * * ,\n2 2N\n\n(5)\n\nn,\u03b1\n\nwhere\n\n(\u03bb)\n\nhri0\n\n=\n\nthe sum over o\n\nPM R\n\n2\nn=1 r|Wn (r)| dr (the HF expe tation value per unit ell), and, using the translational symmetry,\nupied Wannier fun tions has been restri ted to those in referen e unit ell, denoted as |n(o)i, while the\n\nvirtual Wannier fun tion\n\n|\u03b1i\n\nan be in any unit ell of the solid. It is lear from Eq.

Although, Eq. (5) has been derived\n\nontaining only singly-ex ited\n\non\u001cgurations, however, it is easy to verify that even for\n\nomplex wave fun tions, only two other types of matrix elements, viz.,\n\nh\u03b1|r|\u03b2(o)i\n\nand\n\nhm|r|n(o)i\n\nontribute to\n\norrelated expe tation value. These matrix elements originate from intera tion among di\u001berent types of ex ited\n\non\u001cgurations.
