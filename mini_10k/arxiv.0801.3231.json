We compare theoretical modeling with experimental data from driftdominated silicon spin-transport devices, illustrating the non-trivial consequences of employing oblique magnetic fields (due to misalignment or intentional, fixed in-plane field components) to measure the effects of spin\nprecession. Model results are also calculated for Hanle measurements under conditions of diffusion-dominated\ntransport, revealing an expected Hanle peak-widening effect induced by the presence of fixed in-plane magnetic\nbias fields.\n\nSpin transport in semiconductors has recently been the\nsubject of vigorous research because it opens possibilities\nfor creating devices and circuits making use of the spin degree of freedom in addition to manipulation of the electron\ncharge.[1, 2, 3] There has been much presentation in the literature of \"spin-valve\" measurements, where the relative orientation between ferromagnetic \"injector\" and \"detector\" magnetization axes is controlled by an external magnetic field in\nthe device plane, but in the past few years it has been firmly\nestablished that the only convincing, unambiguous proof of\ngenuine spin transport is clear evidence of spin precession\nand dephasing (\"Hanle effect\") in an out-of-plane magnetic\nfield[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nWhile a magnetic field entirely perpendicular to the device\nplane is the easiest geometry to analyze, it is often the case\nthat there are in-plane magnetic field components as well.[10]\nIn addition, it is often desirable to control the relative injector/detector magnetization orientation with an in-plane magnetic bias field in conjunction with a purely perpendicular\nfield.[11]\nHere we show how the standard spin precession model\n(based on drift-diffusion theory)[7, 12] can be modified to\nincorporate these oblique fields, and compare the resulting\ncalculations to experimental data from silicon spin transport\ndevices.[8] Because of silicon's intrinsic advantages for spintronics (small spin-orbit scattering and hyperfine interaction,\nand presence of a spin-degenerate conduction band leading\nto an exceptionally long spin lifetime[8, 13, 14, 15]) and the\ndifficulties in applying spin injection/detection methods developed for other semiconductors to it (caused by an indirect\nbandgap and propensity for interfacial alloying), confirmation of spin transport in this semiconductor using the Hanle\neffect is particularly important. We also use our model to\nanalyze the expected effect of fixed in-plane magnetic fields\non Hanle measurement in the widely-used diffusion-driven\nlateral spin transport technique measured with ferromagnetic\nnonlocal voltage probes.[11, 16, 17, 18]\nWe wish to model the device spin detector output, which\nin linear response is proportional to the projection of final\nspin direction (after transport) on the measurement axis determined by detector magnetization. Under the influence of\n\n\u2217 jli@udel.edu\n\n~ = Bz \u1e91 + By\u0177, where \u1e91 is in the\nan oblique magnetic field B\ndirection normal to the device plane, and \u0177 is in-plane and\nalong the injector/detector magnetization direction, spin is induced\nq to precess around the magnetic field at frequency \u03c9 =\n\ng\u03bcB B2z + B2y /~. In cartesian (x\u2032 , y\u2032 , z\u2032 ) coordinates where the\nmagnetic field is along the z\u2032 direction, the initial spin direction at the injector is ~si = (0, sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle\nbetween the injected spin direction in the device plane (along\n~ as shown in the inset\n\u0177) and the effective magnetic field B,\nof Fig. 1 (a). After precession over transit time t, the final\nspin direction is s~f = (sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, cos \u03b8), where the\nazimuthal \u03c6 is the precession angle \u03c9t. If the injector and detector are in a parallel orientation, the contribution to detected\nsignal from a single precessing electron spin with fixed transit\ntime t is then proportional to ~si * s~f = sin2 \u03b8 cos \u03c6 +cos2 \u03b8. This\nexpression can be simplified to\nB2z cos \u03c9t + B2y\nB2z + B2y\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nusing trigonometric definitions sin \u03b8 = \u221a B2z\n\nBz +B2y\n\n\u221a B2y\n\nBz +B2y\n\nand cos \u03b8 =\n\n.\n\nBecause the transit time from injector to detector for each\nelectron is affected by random walk induced by diffusion, the\nexpected spin signal is a sum of all the projection contributions at different arrival times, weighted by the arrival time\ndistribution. This distribution function, which describes the\nspatio-temporal evolution of an ensemble of spins that all\noriginate at the injector with the same spin orientation (at the\nsame time), is given by the Green's function of the spin driftdiffusion equation.[7, 12, 19] Using Eq. 1, the spin signal\nmeasurement should therefore be proportional to\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\nB2z cos \u03c9t + B2y\n(L\u2212vt)2\n1\ne\u2212 4Dt e\u2212t/\u03c4s f\ndt.\n\u221a\nB2z + B2y\n2 \u03c0Dt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere D is diffusion coefficient, L is transit length, v is drift\nvelocity, and \u03c4 s f is spin lifetime.\nIn the case of an oblique uni-axial magnetic field with constant orientation \u03b8 and magnitude |B|, Eq. 2 reverts to\n\n\f2\n\n100\n\nexperiment\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\nmodel\n\n(b)\n\n116\n\n(a)\n\nexperiment\n\n(b)\n\nmodel\n\n1\n\nB||=61 Oe\n\u03be=\u03b7=0o\n\n114\n\n95\n\nB||=61 Oe\n\u03be=\u03b7=0o\n\n112\n\n\u03b8\n100\n\nBy\n\n95\n\n\u03b8 =50o\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n110\n\n108\n\nz\n\n\u03b7\n118\n\n\u03be\n\n116\n\n112\n\no\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\nMagnetic Field [Oe]\n\n200\n\nB||=61 Oe\n\u03be=-\u03b7=20o\n\n\u03b8 =10\n\n108\n106\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nMagnetic Field [Oe]\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\nMagnetic Field B [Oe]\n\nFIG. 1: Comparison of experimental (a) and simulated (b) Hanle spin\nprecession data in oblique single-axis magnetic fields using devices\nas described in Ref.

The spin signal in these devices is\na hot-electron \"second collector current\" which has traveled\nballistically through a ferromagnetic detector thin film after\ntransport across the full thickness of an undoped single-crystal\nfloat-zone-grown Si(100) wafer. In the top and bottom of Fig.\n1 (b), we have used Eq. 3 with L = 350\u03bcm, D = 200cm2 /s,\nv = 2.9 \u00d7 106 cm/s (at an accelerating voltage of 20V) and\n\u03c4 s f = 73ns[14] to calculate the expected spin signal for corresponding magnetic field orientations.

Inset: geometry of applied fields relative to device axes,\nwhere z is the device normal and y is in the device plane.\n\nverting the sign at the appropriate magnetic field values. Despite the predicted (and experimentally confirmed) reduction\nin signal oscillation magnitude, the extrema are at identical\npositions regardless of the value of \u03b8. This invariance is especially important when the oscillation period is used to determine the electron spin transit time in an unintentionally misaligned magnetic field.[20]\nIt is sometimes desirable to have a static in-plane bias magnetic field (B||, in addition to a perpendicular field B\u22a5 ) to control the relative injector/detector orientations.[11] However,\nthe influence of this fixed field on the measurement results\n~\ncannot be ignored. In particular, because the effective field B\nforms a very small angle \u03b8 with the injected spin direction for\nBz < By , the low-angle (\u03c6 = \u03c9t) precession oscillations are\nsuppressed.\nExperimental measurements of spin precession in a fixed\nin-plane magnetic field of 61 Oe are shown in the top of Fig.\n2(a). As expected, the precession oscillations at small perpendicular field values are suppressed, and the shape of the signal\nreflects the broken up-down symmetry induced by the presence of the in-plane field. Moreover, the oscillation extrema\npositions are shifted (unlike misalignment of a uniaxial field\nwith fixed \u03b8 as shown in Fig. 1), so transit time cannot be\nsimply deduced from oscillation period.[20] Using Eq. 2 with\nBy =61 Oe, we see that the model captures this behavior with\nhigh fidelity, as shown at the top of Fig. 2(b).\nUnlike in single-axis measurements, misalignments of B\u22a5\nand B|| at angles \u03b7 and \u03be from \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 (z axis) and \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 (y\naxis), respectively, (as shown in the inset to Fig. 2 (a)) can\nmake substantial changes to the measured Hanle spin precession signal. In this case, we have\n\n\f3\nin-plane bias magnetic field is used.\nThe strong influence of fixed in-plane fields seen here with\ndrift-dominated spintronics devices[21] are also expected in\nthe diffusion-dominated regime. Evaluating Eq. 2 as a function of Bz with parameters relevant for nonlocal spin-valve\ndevices at low temperature and high doping (D = 1cm2 /s, L =\n1\u03bcm, v = 0, and \u03c4 s f = 10ns) we obtain results for By = 0, 25,\n50, and 75 Oe as shown in Fig. 3 from top to bottom. Notably,\nsecondary oscillations at non-zero Bz (most evident in experiments where drift is the dominant transport mechanism)[7, 8]\nare not seen here because of the wide arrival-time distribution\ndriven by diffusion and the consequently strong spin dephasing.\n\nSpin Precession Signal [arb]\n\nBy=0 Oe\n\nBy=25 Oe\n\nBy=50 Oe\n\nBy=75 Oe\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nMagnetic Field (Bz in Oe)\n\nFIG. 3: Simulated spin precession measurements for diffusion-driven\ntransport across 1\u03bcm, using Eq. 2 as a function of perpendicular\nmagnetic field Bz , with a constant magnetic field (By ) of 0, 25, 50,\nand 75 Oe applied in the device plane.

However, even\nif B\u22a5 and B|| are truly orthogonal so that \u03b7 = \u2212\u03be, sample misalignment (here at 20\u25e6 ) has significant influence on the observed Hanle measurement, causing an obvious asymmetry in\nmagnetic field polarity as expected.

Therefore, to cause the same amount\nof dephasing from signal cancellation, Bz must be increased\nas By increases.\nIncorporating the necessarily non-zero lateral width of the\ninjector and detector introduces a constant source of systematic spin dephasing by adding a fixed transit-length uncertainty that is not expected to affect this trend. Increasing the\ndiffusion constant D and decreasing the spin lifetime \u03c4 s f reduces the strength of this peak-widening effect, but the general\npeak-widening behavior seen here persists because of its geometric origin. However, the presence of magnetic and electricfield inhomogeneities in the transport path will modify the\nmeasured lineshape and could partially obscure the expected\ntrend.\nIn summary, the Hanle spin precession signal magnitude is\nreduced by a factor of sin2 \u03b8 when making measurements in\nsingle-axis oblique magnetic fields at an angle \u03b8 to the device plane. Besides in-plane magnetization switching of injector and detector, small misalignments therefore cause no\nmodification to precession measurements to first order. When\na fixed in-plane magnetic field is used in conjunction with a\nvaried perpendicular field, Hanle measurements are affected\nby a suppression of precession oscillations at low fields and\nasymmetry when the device is misaligned. Results from simulations of devices where diffusion is the dominant transport\nmechanism indicate that a widening of Hanle peak width is\nexpected in the presence of these in-plane bias fields.\nSupport from DARPA/MTO and ONR is acknowledged.\n\n[5] M.
