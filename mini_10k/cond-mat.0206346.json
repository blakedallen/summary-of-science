Near\nmagnetic fields corresponding to integer Landau level filling, submicron scale spatial structure in the out-of-phase\ncomponent of the tunneling signal becomes visible. In the images presented here, the structure repeats itself when\nthe filling factor is changed from \u03bd = 6 to \u03bd = 7. Therefore, we believe the images reflect small modulations in the\n2DES density caused by the disorder in the sample.\nKey words: 2D electron system; scanning probe imaging ; tunneling ;\n\nScanned probe techniques sensitive to electric fields\ncan provide direct images of 2D electron systems [1].\nHere, we present an extension of Subsurface Charge\nAccumulation (SCA) imaging [2], adapted to probe\nthe 2DES interior in a novel tunneling geometry [3].\nThe measurement works as follows and is schematically shown in Fig. 1(a): A tunneling barrier separates\nthe 2D layer and a parallel 3D substrate. An ac excitation voltage applied between the substrate and a\nsharp metal tip locally induces charge to tunnel back\nand forth between the 3D and 2D layers. The measured signal is the resulting ac image charge on the tip\nelectrode, and no charge tunnels directly onto the tip.\nIn this way, the experiment provides a local measurement of the ability of the 2D system to accommodate\nadditional electrons.\nThe sample used for these measurements was an\nAl0.3 Ga.7 As / GaAs (001) wafer grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), shown schematically in Fig.\n1\n\nCorresponding author.

The 2DES is located a distance of 60 nm below\nthe exposed surface, and a distance 40 nm above a\ndegenerately doped (1018 cm\u22123 ) GaAs substrate (3D\nmetal). The average electron density in the 2DES is\n6 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 , the low-temperature transport mobility is \u223c 105 cm2 /Vs and the zero magnetic field 3D2D tunneling rate is approximately 200 kHz. We position the tip to within a few nanometers of the sample\nsurface using an innovative scanning head that provides a high degree of mechanical and thermal stability [4]. The image charge signal is detected using a\ncircuit constructed from low-input-capacitance highelectron-mobility transistors. To acquire images, the\ntip is scanned laterally across the surface without the\nuse of feedback. The data were acquired with the system immersed in liquid helium-3 at a temperature of\n270 mK, with a 20 kHz applied excitation voltage of 8\nmV rms.\nFig. 1(b) shows a simple equivalent circuit for the\nmeasurement: The local contribution to the signal is\nmodeled as a tip-2DES capacitance Ctip in series with\nthe tunneling barrier, represented as a capacitor CT\nand resistor RT in parallel. To account for phase shifts\n31 October 2018\n\n\fFig. 2. Out-of-phase data near \u03bd = 6 and \u03bd = 7. (a) A fixed-tip\nQout curve displaying the \u03bd = 6 and \u03bd = 7 peaks, acquired\nnear the upper right corner of the imaged area. (b) Two 3\u03bcm\n\u00d73\u03bcm images with values of B indicated as dots in (a). All\ndata was acquired with the tip bias adjusted to equal the\ncontact potential [5], so that the tip itself does not produce a\ndc perturbation of the 2DES, as determined by in situ Kelvin\nprobe measurements. Charge sensitivity calculated from this\ndata is \u223c 0.06 e/Hz1/2 . Topographic component of Qout has\nbeen subtracted [3].\n\nFig. 1. (a) Schematic of heterostructure sample and SCA\nmeasurement. The 2DES forms in the potential well at the\nGaAs/AlGaAs interface from electrons provided by silicon\ndopants (+'s). An AlGaAs tunneling barrier separates the\n2DES from a 3D substrate. (b) Equivalent circuit of the sample-tip system. (c) In-phase and 90\u25e6 out-of-phase signals (Qin\nand Qout ) versus frequency f and tunneling resistance RT .\nThe charging has identical functional dependence on f and\nRT , with characteristic values of f0 = [2\u03c0RT (CT + Ctip )]\u22121\nand R0 = [2\u03c0f (CT + Ctip )]\u22121 , respectively. The magnitude of\nthe curves is set by the tip-sample capacitance difference \u2206C\nbetween a fully charging and locally non-charging 2DES. The\ndashed curves qualitatively show the enhancements in Qin and\nQout as the in-plane relaxation rates approach the tunneling\nrate.\n\nAs one lowers the field the structure appears at around\n\u03bd = 6, then disappears and again reappears at around\n\u03bd = 7. This re-emergent behavior likely originates from\ndensity modulations induced by the static disorder potential, consistent with the interpretation in [2]. Structure is seen down to a length scale of few hundred nm;\nthe spatial resolution of our technique is set by the radius of curvature of the tip, nominally 50 nm in this\ncase. More surprisingly, structure also exists in length\nscales \u223c 1\u03bcm, in contrast to the expextation that the\ndisorder length scale is set by the distance to the donors\nand to the 3D layer (both 15 nm in our case).\nThis work was supported by the National Science\nFoundation (DMR-0075230). SHT acknowledges support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\n\nwe define two amplitudes Qin and Qout , representing\nrespectively the in-phase and 90\u25e6 out-of-phase (lagging) components of the image charge per unit excitation voltage, typical units being aF. Fig. 1(c) shows\nthe charging characteristics of the circuit. In zero magnetic field, the tunneling rate across the barrier f0 is\nabout ten times higher than the 20 kHz excitation frequency. In this frequency range, the out-of-phase component is more sensitive to variations in the local tunneling resistance. In contrast, the in-phase component\nis mostly sensitive to capacitance variations. More rigorous models show an enhancement in the charging\ncharacteristics as the 2DES becomes an increasingly\npoor conductor, i.e., as the system approaches integer\nfilling, as indicated qualitatively by the dashed curves\nin Fig. 1(c).\nAs the magnetic field approaches integer fillings \u03bd =\n6 and \u03bd = 7, we observe an increase in Qout , corresponding to an increase in RT , as shown in the fixedtip signal of Fig. 2(a). Clear and reproducible features\nappear also in image scans, as exemplified in Fig. 2(b).\n\nReferences\n[1] K. L. McCormick et al., Phys. Rev.
