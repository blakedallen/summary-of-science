Introduction\n\nEnergy Scale\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b5 /\u03b5 is a fundamental test for our understanding of flavor\u2013changing phenomena. It represents\na great source of inspiration for physics research\nand has motivated in recent years a very interesting scientific controversy, both on the experimental and theoretical sides. The present world\naverage is [1]\nRe (\u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5) = (1.93 \u00b1 0.24) * 10\u22123 ,\n\n(1)\n\nproviding clear evidence for a non-zero \u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5 value.\nThe theoretical status is instead more debated\n(see ref. [2] for a brief review). One of the problems that had to be faced during the past years\nhas been that, while CP violation is born at\na scale say O(MW ), the observables that enter\nin the game have to be estimated at a scale of\nO(MK ) (see fig. 1). Changing the order of magnitude of the scales one considers, different physical effects appear and have to be disentangled. In\nthis picture, the physics is described by a chain\nof different effective field theories, with different\nparticle content, which match each other at the\ncorresponding boundary (heavy threshold). This\nprocedure permits to perform an explicit summation of large logarithms t \u2261 ln (M/m), where M\nand m refer to any scale appearing in the evolution.\n\u2217 Talk\n\npresented at QCD2000, Montpellier july 2000.

We have explicitly factorized the Fermi coupling GF and the\nCabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements Vij containing the usual Cabibbo suppression of K decays.\n\n\f2\nThe overall renormalization scale \u03bc separates\nthe short\u2013 (M > \u03bc) and long\u2013 (m < \u03bc) distance contributions, which are contained in Ci (\u03bc)\nand Qi , respectively. The physical amplitudes\nare of course independent of \u03bc; thus, the explicit\nscale/scheme dependence of the Wilson coefficients should cancel exactly with the corresponding dependence of the Qi matrix elements between on-shell states. Usually one refers to this as\nthe \"matching\" between Wilson coefficients and\nhadronic matrix elements. Thanks to the completion of the next-to-leading logarithmic order calculation of the Wilson coefficients [5,6], all gluonic corrections of O(\u03b1ns tn ) and O(\u03b1n+1\ntn ) are\ns\nalready known. Moreover, the complete mt /MW\ndependence (at lowest order in \u03b1s ) has been taken\ninto account. We will fully use this information\nup to scales \u03bc \u223c O(1 GeV), without making any\nunnecessary expansion in powers of 1/Nc . The\nmost debated part of the calculation regards the\nestimate of hadronic matrix elements. In the following it is presented a brief summary of the main\ningredients of this part of the computation.\n2. Low energy effective theory\nIn order to define an effective field theory at\nlow scale one can use global symmetry considerations. In this way one arrives at the \u03c7PT description of the Standard Model, which describes\nthe dynamics of the QCD Goldstone bosons (\u03c0,\nK, \u03b7) as an expansion in powers of momenta and\nquark masses over the chiral symmetry breaking\nscale (\u039b\u03c7 \u223c 1 GeV).\nAt lowest order, the relevant most general effective bosonic Lagrangian, with the same SU (3)L \u2297\nSU (3)R transformation properties and quantum\nnumbers as the short\u2013distance Lagrangian (2),\ncontains four terms:\n(\nGF\n\u2206S=1\n\u2217\nL2\n= \u2212 \u221a Vud Vus g8 f 4 h\u03bbL\u03bc L\u03bc i\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n4\nL\u03bc23 L11 + L\u03bc21 L13\n+g27 f\n3\n)\n+e2 f 6 gEW h\u03bbU \u2020 QU i\n\n+ h.c. ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the matrix L\u03bc = \u2212iU \u2020 D\u03bc U represents the\n\noctet of V \u2212 A currents, at lowest order in derivatives, f \u223c f\u03c0 = 92.4 MeV, Q = diag( 23 , \u2212 31 , \u2212 13 )\nis the quark charge matrix, \u03bb \u2261 (\u03bb6 \u2212 i\u03bb7 )/2\nprojects onto the s\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304 transition [\u03bbij = \u03b4i3 \u03b4j2 ]\nand hAi denotes the flavor trace of A. The chiral couplings g8 and g27 measure the strength\nof the two parts of the effective Hamiltonian (2)\ntransforming as (8L , 1R ) and (27L , 1R ), respectively, under chiral rotations. The moduli of g8\nand g27 can be extracted from the CP\u2013conserving\npart of K \u2192 2\u03c0 decays; at lowest order a phenomenological analysis gives [7]: g8 + 91 g27 \u2243\n5.1, |g27 /g8 | \u2243 1/18. The huge difference between these two couplings shows the well\u2013known\nenhancement of the octet |\u2206I| = 1/2 transitions.\nThe theoretical calculation of the couplings gI\nis a difficult task. One observes, however, that\nwhat really matters in the calculation of \u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5 are\nnot the moduli of these couplings gI but their\nimaginary parts. In fact as ImgI \u226a RegI , one\ncan deduce RegI from the experiment, but it is\nnecessary to give a prediction for ImgI . Moreover\nthe matching between the Lagrangians of eq. 2\nand eq. 3 must be provided. The large\u2013Nc expansion offers the possibility to solve both these\nproblems in a simple and elegant way. In the limit\nof a large color number each four\u2013quark operator\nfactorize into currents which have a well known\nchiral realization. Thus one obtains\n3\n16B02\n2\nL5 C6 ,\ng8\u221e = \u2212 C1 + C2 + C4 \u2212\n5\n5\nf2\n3\n\u221e\ng27\n=\n(C1 + C2 ) ,\n5\n3B 2\n\u221e\n(4)\ngEW\n= \u2212 2 02 C8 ,\ne f\nwhere B0 = \u2212hq\u0304qi(\u03bc)/f\u03c02 . Now the dominant\npart of the contributions to \u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5 (or, which is the\nsame, to Img8,EW ) is provided by the operators\nQ6,8 whose behavior in the large\u2013Nc limit is different from the rest of operators. In fact when\nNc \u2192 \u221e the only anomalous dimensions which\nsurvive are the ones corresponding to these operators [8,9]. Then Q6,8 factorize in the product of color\u2013singlet scalar and pseudoscalar currents which generate the factors B0 of eq. 4. The\nscale/scheme dependence of the quark condensate\nB0 exactly cancels the one of the Wilson coeffi-\n\n\f3\ncient C6,8 [9]. The anomalous dimension of all the\nother operators is zero for Nc \u2192 \u221e. This means\nthat in order to achieve a reliable estimate of the\nmatrix elements of these operators it is necessary\nto go to next\u2013to\u2013leading order in the Nc expansion. That is why the \u2206I = 1/2 rule is so difficult\nto demonstrate. Finally one notes that eq. 4 is\n(3/2)\n(1/2)\nperfectly equivalent to say B8\n\u223c B6\n= 1.\nThat is, upto minor inputs, the prediction obtained in both large\u2013Nc and \u03c7PT expansions reproduces the results of ref. [5,6].\n3. Chiral loops\nThe ultraviolet logarithms that have been resummed using the renormalization group equation are not the only source of large logs appearing in the estimate of \u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5. It is well known [10]\nthat infrared logs provide a source of enhancement for I = 0 amplitudes which has to be taken\ninto account. The one loop correction already\nprovides an enhancement of about 40% and still\nunderestimates the observed \u03b400 phase shift. A resummation of higher order effect is so necessary\nand it has been provided in ref. [11,12] and discussed also in this conference [13]. The approach\nis based on the Omn\u00e8s solution for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes [14]. The Omn\u00e8s solution for a CP conserving (but the same conclusions hold also for\nthe CP violating) K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude can be written in the generic form\n\u0001\n2\n2\n)\nAI = MK\n\u2212 M\u03c02 aI (MK\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\n= MK \u2212 M\u03c0 \u03a9I (MK , s0 ) aI (s0 )\n\u0001\nI\n2\n2\n2\n, s0 ) aI (s0 ) ei\u03b40 (MK ) ,\n= MK\n\u2212 M\u03c02 RI (MK\n\nwhere aI (s) as a function of the total energy\nsquared s has been explicitly computed up to\none\u2013loop in ChPT [12]. The Omn\u00e8s factor\n2\n\u03a9I (MK\n, s0 ) can be interpreted as an evolution\n2\noperator from the subtraction point s0 to MK\n.\nIt can be split into the dispersive contribution\n2\n, s0 ) and the usual phase shift exponenRI (MK\ntial. For each of the amplitudes aI , with I = 0, 2\nthe s dependence can be written in a simple form:\n\b\naI (s) = aI (0) 1 + gI (s) + O(p4 ) .\n(5)\n\nThe s dependence of the one\u2013loop correction at\nlow values of s is dominated by the pure SU (2)\n\neffect of elastic \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering. These universal infrared effects enhance the I = 0 amplitudes while suppress the I = 2 amplitude. I underline that the only role of the Omn\u00e8s factor remains that of providing an efficient resummation\nof large infrared effects due to FSI. The advantage\nof the Omn\u00e8s exponentiation respect to the usual\none\u2013loop ChPT computation is to control the uncertainty coming from higher order (\u2265 two\u2013loops)\nFSI effects.\nTaking a low subtraction point s0 = 0 where\nhigher\u2013order corrections are expected to be small,\nwe can just multiply the tree\u2013level amplitudes\nwith the experimentally determined Omn\u00e8s exponentials [12]. The two dispersive correction factors thus obtained are\n2\nR0 (MK\n, 0) =\n2\nR2 (MK , 0) =\n\n1.55 \u00b1 0.10;\n0.92 \u00b1 0.03 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the errors take into account a) the uncertainties of the fits to the experimental phase\nshifts data used in the calculation of the Omn\u00e8s\nfactor and b) the additional inelastic contributions above the first inelastic threshold. Finally\nsince FSI effects are next-to-leading in the 1/Nc\nexpansion but numerically large, this procedure\navoids any double counting. Since the Omn\u00e8s\nfactor can be applied directly to each matrix element hQi iI , the final estimate with the inclusion\nof FSI effects can be expressed via the product\nhQi iI = hQi i\u221e\nI * RI .\n4. Numerical results\nA full numerical analysis of \u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5 taking into account also smaller effects will be presented elsewhere [15]. To a reasonably good approximation\nhowever one can take as an estimate the one coming from [5]\ni\nh\n\u03b5\u2032\n(1/2)\n(3/2)\n,\n(7)\n\u223c B6\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9IB ) \u2212 0.4B8\n\u03b5\nwhere now the B\u2013parameters and the factor \u03a9IB\nhave to be corrected taking into account also the\ncontribution of FSI, that is\n(1/2)\n\n= B6\n\n(3/2)\n\n= B8\n\n\u03a9IB\n\n2\n2\n, 0)/R0 (MK\n, 0) = 0.09 .\n= 0.16 * R2 (MK\n\nB6\n\nB8\n\n(1/2)\n(3/2)\n\n2\n|Nc \u2192\u221e * R0 (MK\n, 0) = 1.55 ,\n\n2\n|Nc \u2192\u221e * R2 (MK\n, 0) = 0.92 ,\n\n\f4\nThe effect of FSI is numerically evident. The\ncancellation between the I = 0 and I = 2 amplitudes is strongly removed and also the effect\nof the isospin breaking term proportional to \u03a9IB\nlooses its weight. The prediction one obtains for\n\u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5 is so\n\u03b5\u2032 /\u03b5 \u2243 (1.7 \u00b1 0.6) * 10\u22124\n\n(8)\n\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nwhich compares well with the present world average in eq. 1. In this prediction all sources of\nlarge logs are finally taken into account. Q6,8 are\nwell approximated by the leading terms in 1/Nc .\nTherefore one expects reasonably that the size of\nthe missing NLO\u2013Nc corrections are of the order\nof 30%. At present the estimate of these effects\ncan only be done within specific models [2,16\u201319].\n\n10.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n12.\n13.\n\n1. A.
