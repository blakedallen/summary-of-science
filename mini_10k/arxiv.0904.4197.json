In the BCS regime\nthe pair breaking and phase coherence temperature scales are essentially the same allowing strong\ncorrelations between the amplitude and phase of the order parameter.

Finally, we find that the superfluid is more\nrobust against weak disorder in the intermediate region between the two regimes.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.Ss, 03.75.Hh, 05.30.Fk\n\nUltracold atoms are special systems for studying superfluid phases of fermions or bosons at very low temperatures, because of unprecedented tunability. In particular, ultracold fermions with tunable interactions were\nused to study experimentally the so-called BCS-to-BEC\nevolution, and population imbalanced systems. In addition, there are other interesting directions to be pursued,\nincluding studies of the BCS-to-BEC evolution in optical lattices [1, 2], and the effects of disorder during the\nBCS-to-BEC evolution, which would allow the very important study of the simultaneous effects of interactions\nand disorder at zero [3] and finite temperatures [4].\nIn ordinary condensed matter (CM) systems the control of interactions is not possible, and the control of\ndisorder is very limited, because the disorder potential is\nnot known and can not be changed at the turn of a knob.\nThus, in standard CM the disorder is usually described in\nterms of defects or impurities, whose positions in the solid\nare assumed to be random. In ultracold atoms it is now\npossible to create controlled disorder using laser speckles\nor lasers with incommensurate wavelengths, which were\nused to study the phenomenon of Anderson localization\nin ultracold Bose atoms [5, 6], but that could also be used\nto study disorder effects in ultracold fermions.\nThus, here, we describe the finite temperature phase\ndiagram of three dimensional (3D) s-wave Fermi superfluids from the BCS to the BEC limit as a function of\ndisorder, which is independent of the hyperfine states of\nthe atoms and is created by a Gaussian-correlated laser\nspeckle potential. Our main results are as follows. First,\nin the BCS limit the amplitude and phase of the order\nparameter are strongly coupled, such that pair breaking\nand loss of phase coherence occur simultaneously. In this\ncase, the critical temperature is essentially unaffected by\nweak disorder, since the disorder potential is not pairbreaking and phase coherence is not easily destroyed in\naccordance with Anderson's theorem [7]. Second, in the\nBEC limit the breaking of local pairs and the loss of phase\n\ncoherence occur at very different temperature scales. In\nthis case, the critical temperature is strongly affected by\nweak disorder, since phase coherence is more easily destroyed without the need to break local pairs simultaneously, and Anderson's theorem does not apply. Third, we\nfind that superfluidity is more robust to disorder in the\nintermediate region between the BCS and BEC regimes.\nTo investigate the physics described above, we start\nwith the real space Hamiltonian (h\u0304 = 1) density for three\ndimensional s-wave superfluids\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22072\n\u2212 \u03bc + Vdis (x) \u03c8\u03c3 (x)+\u00db (x), (1)\nH(x) = \u03c8\u03c3\u2020 (x) \u2212\n2m\nR \u2032\nwhere \u00db (x) = + dx V (x, x\u2032 )\u03c8\u2191\u2020 (x\u2032 )\u03c8\u2193\u2020 (x\u2032 )\u03c8\u2193 (x)\u03c8\u2191 (x)\nrepresents a term containing the interaction potential\nV (x, x\u2032 ) = \u2212g \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ), and \u03c8\u03c3\u2020 (x) represents the creation of fermions with mass m and hyperfine state (spin)\n\u03c3. In addition, Vdis (x) represents the disorder potential,\nand \u03bc, the chemical potential. We choose Vdis (x) to be\nindependent of the hyperfine state, a choice that can be\neasily relaxed.\nAlthough there are many ways to introduce disorder,\nwe will make a particular choice that the disorder potentialRis governed by a Gaussian distribution P [Vdis ] =\n2\nexp[\u2212R dxVdis\n(x)/(2\u03ba)]/A,\nwith normalization constant\nR\n2\nA = D[Vdis ] exp[\u2212 dxVdis\n(x)/(2\u03ba)], which leads to the\nconfigurational average hVdis (x)Vdis (x\u2032 )i = \u03ba \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\nTo derive the effective action for a fixed configuration\nof disorder, we define the local chemical potential \u03bc(x) =\n\u03bc \u2212 Vdis (x) and follow the functional integral formulation\nof the evolution from BCS to BEC superfluidity [8] to\nobtain Seff = S0 + SG , where S0 is the action of unbound\nfermions in the presence of weak disorder and is given by\nZ\ni\nX h\n2\ndx\nln 1 + e\u2212\u03be(k,x)/T , (2)\nS0 [Vdis ] = \u2212\nV\nk\n\nwith \u03be(k, x) = \u01ebk \u2212 \u03bc(x), and \u01ebk = k 2 /2m. The second contribution to Seff corresponds to Gaussian pairing\n\n\f2\nP P2\n\nfluctuations\nSG [Vdis ] =\n\n1\nTV\n\nZ\n\ndx\n\nX\n\n\u22121\n \u0304\n\u2206(q)\u0393\n(q, Vdis )\u2206(q),\n\n(3)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u2206(q) is the pairing field, and\n\u0393\u22121 (q, Vdis ) =\n\nX\nk\n\ndn [X1n + X2n ] \u03930 (q)/V where the coefficients\nare d0 = \u2212d2 = 1/(4T z), d1 = 1/z 2.\nThe total thermodynamic potential is then \u03a9av (\u03ba) =\n\u03a90,av (\u03ba)+\u03a9G,av (\u03ba), and the corresponding number equation is N = \u2212\u2202\u03a9av (\u03ba)/\u2202\u03bc, where\nk\n\nX1 + X2\n+ C (4)\n[2(iql \u2212 \u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 \u2212 2Vdis (x))]\n\nis the pair correlation function in thePpresence of disorder, where C = \u2212(mV /4\u03c0as ) + k (2\u01ebk )\u22121 , q =\n(q, iql ) represents the four-momentum, the function\nX1 = tanh [(\u03be1 + Vdis (x)) /2T ] describes the occupation\nof fermions with energy \u03be1 = \u03be(k\u2212q/2), and the function\nX2 = tanh [(\u03be2 + Vdis (x)) /2T ] describes the occupation\nof fermions with energy \u03be2 = \u03be(k + q/2).\nThe description above corresponds to a semiclassical approximation which is valid for weak disorder potentials. However, quenched (as opposed to annealed)\ndisorder is characterized by a static disorder potential\nand the necessity to average the thermodynamic potential \u03a9(Vdis ) rather than the partition function [9]. The\nconfigurationally averaged thermodynamic potential is\n\u03a9av (\u03ba) = h\u03a9(Vdis )i, and depends on disorder via the\nparameter \u03ba. The thermodynamic potential for a fixed\nconfiguration is \u03a9(Vdis ) = \u2212T ln Z(Vdis ) when expressed\nin terms of the partition function Z(Vdis ) = Z0 (Vdis ) \u00d7\nZG (Vdis ), where Z0 (Vdis ) = exp [\u2212S0 (Vdis )] is the partition\nfunction\u0002 for unbound fermions,\nand ZG (Vdis ) =\nR\n\u0003\nD[\u03a8\u0304, \u03a8] exp \u2212SG (\u03a8\u0304, \u03a8, Vdis ) is the partition function\nfor the pairing field. Thus, \u03a9(Vdis ) = \u03a90 (Vdis )+\u03a9G (Vdis ),\nwhere the unbound fermion thermodynamic potential is\n\u03a90 (Vdis ) = \u2212T ln Z0 (Vdis ) = T S0 (Vdis ) while the pairing\nfield contribution is \u03a9G (Vdis ) = \u2212T ln ZG (Vdis ), which is\napproximated by\nZ\nX\nT\n\u03a9G (Vdis ) = \u2212\ndx\nln [T \u0393(q, Vdis (x))] . (5)\nV\nq\nExpanding in Vdis and taking the configurational average leads to \u03a90,av (\u03ba) = T hS0 [Vdis ]i = \u03a90,av (0) +\n\u2206\u03a90,av (\u03ba) for the thermodynamic potential of unbound fermions, and \u03a9G,av (\u03ba) = \u03a9G,av (0) + \u2206\u03a9G,av (\u03ba)\nfor the thermodynamic potential due to the pairing field. Here, \u03a90,av (0) and \u03a9G,av (0) are just the\nthermodynamic potentials without disorder [8], while\nthe disorder-dependent corrections to Pthe thermodynamic potential\nare \u2206\u03a90,av (\u03ba) =\u0003 \u2212T k L(k)\u03ba, with\n\u0002\nL(k)P = 1/ 2T 2 (1 + cosh(\u03bek /T )) , and \u2206\u03a9G,av (\u03ba) =\n\u2212T q M (q)\u03ba with M (q) = P (q) \u2212 |Q(q)|2 /2.\nThe first term of M (q) can be expressed as\nP P3\nP (q) = k n=0 cn [X1n + X2n ] \u03930 (q)/V where \u03930 (q) =\n\u0393(q, Vdis = 0) and Xm = tanh [(\u03bem )/2T ]. In addition,\nthe coefficients found in the expansion are c0 = \u2212c2 =\n1/(2T z), c1 = (16T 2 \u2212 z 2 )/(8T 2 z 3 ), and c3 = 1/(8T 2z),\nwith z = iql \u2212 \u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 . The second term is Q(q) =\n\nn=0\n\nN = N0 (\u03ba) + NG (\u03ba),\n\n(6)\n\nwith N0 (\u03ba) = \u2202\u03a90,av (\u03ba)/\u2202\u03bc being due to unbound\nfermions, and NG (\u03ba) = \u2202\u03a9G,av (\u03ba)/\u2202\u03bc being due to pairing. In the limit of \u03ba \u2192 0, the standard results for the\nthermodynamic potential, number equation, and timedependent Ginzburg-Landau theory are found [8]. However, in the presence of disorder and in the vicinity\nof Tc , the low-energy and long-wavelength Lagrangian\ndensity LG = LN D + LD derived from the action of\nEqs. (2) and (3) has two contributions. The first is a\nnon-dissipative part\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng\u2217\n\u22072\n\u2212 \u03bc\u2217 + \u03b3Vdis (x) \u03a8 + |\u03a8|4 ,\nLN D (x, \u03c4 ) = \u03a8\u0304 \u2202\u03c4 \u2212\n2m\u2217\n2\nwhere \u03a8 = \u03a8(x, \u03c4 ). Here, the term containing the effective mass m\u2217 is the kinetic energy of the pairing field,\n\u03bc\u2217 plays the role of the pairing field chemical potential,\ng\u2217 is the effective interaction, and \u03b3Vdis (x) is the effective disorder potential. The second term is the dissipative\ncontribution reflecting the decay of fermion pairs into unbound fermions, which takes the Caldeira-Leggett form\nZ\n|\u03a8(x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03a8(x, \u03c4 \u2032 )|2\n\u03bb\n.\nd\u03c4 \u2032\nLD (x, \u03c4 ) =\n2\u03c0\n(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 )2\nSince we are considering the case of weak disorder,\nthese parameters can be easily related to original parameters of the theory without disorder [8]. Using the notation X = tanh(\u03bek /2T ) and Y = sech2 (\u03bek /2T\n), the origi\nP h 1\nmV\nX\ninal coefficients are a(\u03bc, T ) = \u2212 4\u03c0a\n,\n+\n\u2212\nk\n2\u01eb\n2\u03be\ns\nk\nk\ncorresponding to the order parameter equation in the absence of disorder when a(\u03bc, T ) = 0,\n\u0015\nX\u0014 X\nY\nXY kz2\nc(\u03bc, T ) =\n,\n\u2212\n+\n8\u03bek2\n16\u03bek T\nT 2 16m\u03bek\nk\n\nP\n2\nand d(\u03bc,\ndR + idI , \u0003with dR =\nk X/4\u03bek and\n\u0002 T) =\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndI = \u03c0N (\u01ebF ) \u03bc/(8T \u01ebF ) \u0398(\u03bc)\ndetermine\ni the effective\nP hX\nY2\nmass m\u2217 , while b(\u03bc, T ) = k 4\u03be2 \u2212 8\u03be2 T and d deterk\nk\nmine the effective interaction g\u2217 . For instance, the effective mass is m\u2217 = dR m/c, the effective chemical potential \u03bc\u2217 = \u2212a/dR , the effective interaction is g\u2217 = b/d2R ,\nthe dimensionless amplitude of the disorder potential is\n\u03b3 = \u2212(\u2202a/\u2202\u03bc)/dR , and \u03bb = dI /dR . A natural choice of\ndimensionless parameters are 1/(kF as ) for interactions,\n\u03b7 = \u03banF /\u01eb2F for disorder, and Te = T /\u01ebF for temperature,\nwhere kF is the Fermi momentum, nF = kF3 /3\u03c0 2 is the\nfermion density and \u01ebF = kF2 /2m is the Fermi energy.\n\n\f3\n\n\u03bc\u2217 (Te, 1/(kF as )) = 0\n\n(7)\n\ncorresponds precisely to the order parameter equation in\nthe absence of disorder a(\u03bc, T ) = 0, indicating that this\nequation is not explicitly affected by weak disorder, as\nrequired by Anderson's theorem [7]. However, the determination of the critical temperature Tc (\u03b7) and the chemical potential \u03bcc (\u03b7) as a function of dimensionless disorder\n\u03b7 for a fixed scattering parameter 1/(kF as ) requires the\nsimultaneous solutions of the number Eq.

In the BCS limit without\ndisorder the order parameter equation alone \u03bc\u2217 = 0 (or\na = 0) determines the critical temperature [8]. As seen\nabove this equation remains unchanged in the presence\nof weak disorder. Thus, the critical temperature is essentially unchanged, because the fermion chemical potential\n\u03bc is very large, positive, and remains pinned to \u01ebF , in the\ncase of perfect particle-hole symmetry. This is a manifestation of Anderson's theorem, and changes in the critical\ntemperature can occur only via the disorder dependent\nshift in the chemical potential, which leads to a change\nin the single particle density of states.\nThe number equation in the BCS limit is approximated\nby N \u2248 N0 (0) + \u2206N0 (\u03b7). The first coefficient represents the contribution in the absence of disorder N0 (0) =\nP\ninvolves the efk (1\u2212X), while the second contribution\nP\nfects of disorder \u2206N0 (\u03b7) = \u03b7 k XY /4(Te)2 . In the case\nof perfect particle-hole symmetry \u2206N0 (\u03b7) = 0, and indeed \u03bc = \u01ebF . Thus, strictly in the BCS limit (1/kF as \u2192\n\u2212\u221e), where the assumption of perfect particle-hole symmetry is made, the chemical potential is pinned to the\nFermi energy (\u03bc = \u01ebF ) and the critical temperature is\n\nunchanged Tc = (e\u03b3 /\u03c0)8e\u22122 exp(\u2212\u03c0/2kF |as |). Since the\npresence of disorder does not alter the total density of\nfermions nF = kF3 /3\u03c0 2 , relaxing the condition of perfect\nparticle-hole symmetry makes the chemical potential adjust itself to \u03bc = \u01ebF \u2212 \u2206\u03bc(\u03b7), with \u2206\u03bc(\u03b7) > 0 leading\nto a corresponding reduction in the critical temperature\nTc (\u03b7) = Tc (0) \u2212 \u2206Tc (\u03b7), with \u2206Tc (\u03b7) > 0. In Fig. 1a,\nthe behavior of the pairing temperature Tp (\u03b7) and the\ncritical temperature Tc (\u03b7) are shown in the BCS regime\nas a function of \u03b7 for 1/kF as = \u22121.8. These curves are\nobtained by solving the corresponding number and order\nparameter equations for varying \u03b7.\nAs the attraction is increased towards unitarity and\n\u03bc = 0, the relative change in Tc for fixed disorder parameter \u03b7, expressed as \u2206Tc /Tc(0) = [1 \u2212 Tc (\u03b7)/Tc (0)],\ndecreases as the attraction strength is increased, and\nreaches a minimum as indicated in Fig. 2. Beyond this\nminimum \u2206Tc /Tc (0) increases again, being the largest\nin the BEC regime. These results indicate that superfluidity is more robust to disorder in the intermediate\nregime of \u22121 < 1/(kF as ) < 1, where the coherence length\nreaches a minimum [8] (or the critical current reaches a\nmaximum). However, the relative change \u2206Tp /Tp (0) =\n[1 \u2212 Tp (\u03b7)/Tp (0)] for fixed disorder always decreases with\n1/(kF as ) indicating that it becomes increasingly more\ndifficult to break pairs with larger binding energy as the\nBEC regime is approached. As discussed next, the difference in behavior between \u2206Tc /Tc (0) and \u2206Tp /Tp (0)\nin the BEC regime is attributed to temporal phase fluctuations, which become increasingly more important as\n1/(kF as ) increases.\n1\n\n0.1\n\nT/T\n\nNotice that the condition\n\n0.01\n\n1E-3\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1/k a\nF\n\n1\n\ns\n\nFIG. 2: The relative change \u2206Tc /Tc (0) (solid line) and\n\u2206Tp /Tp (0) (dashed line) throughout the BCS to BEC evolution for \u03b7 = 0.1. Notice the minimum in \u2206Tc /Tc (0) occuring\nin the intermediate region \u22121 < 1/kF as < 1 indicating that\nthe superfluid is more robust to disorder in this region, while\nthe \u2206Tp /Tp (0) always decreases indicating that the pairing\ntemperature becomes less sensitive to disorder in the BEC\nregime. The dotted line corresponds to the analytical result\nin the BEC limit.\n\nIn the BEC regime, \u03b3 \u2192 2 indicating that the pairing\nfield feels an effective disorder potential twice as large as\nthat felt by individual unbound fermions, but \u03bb \u2192 0 indi-\n\n\f4\ncating that the dynamics of the pairing field is undamped,\nreflecting that tightly-bound fermion pairs have very long\nlifetimes. In the BEC regime (1/kF as \u226b 1) the number\nequation is dominated by the contributions coming from\nNG \u226b N0 given that all fermions are paired into molecular bosons. Here, NG is well approximated by the number of bound fermions (molecular bosons) NB , since the\nnumber of scattering states NSC is very small.

For swave superfluids, we showed that weak disorder does not\naffect the critical temperature of a BCS superfluid with\nperfect particle-hole symmetry in accordance with Anderson's theorem, as the breaking of fermion pairs and\nthe loss of phase coherence must occur at the same temperature. However in the BEC regime, phase coherence\nis more easily destroyed by disorder without the need of\nsimultaneously breaking fermion pairs. Finally, we also\nshowed that the superfluid is more robust to the presence\nof weak disorder in the intermediate (crossover) region.\nWe thank NSF (DMR-0709584) for support.\n\n(8)\n\nwhen \u03bc\u0304\u2217 = 0.\nThe solution for Tc can be obtained numerically, but an analytical solution is possible when \u0002\u03b7 = \u03banF /\u01eb2F \u226a 1.\u0003 This leads to\nTc = Tc (0) 1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u03baTc (0)m3\u2217 /6\u03c0 2 nB , where Tc (0) =\n2/3\n2\u03c0 [nB /\u03b6(3/2)] /m\u2217 is the Bose-Einstein condensation\ntemperature for a gas of molecular bosons, which becomes Tc (0) = 0.218\u01ebF , when m\u2217 \u2192 2m and nB \u2192 nF /2.\nUnlike in the BCS regime, the critical temperature Tc\nis directly affected by the presence of disorder in the\nBEC regime, and is determined essentially by the number equation. A small amount of disorder affects the\nphase coherence of the molecular bosons through the\nemergence of an incoherent part in the molecular boson p\nGreen's function G\u22121 (q) manifested by the branch\ncut |\u03bc\u0304\u2217 | \u2212 iql present in the self-energy \u03a3(q). If only\nthe zero frequency (iql = 0) contribution were considered, one would be led to the conclusion that disorder would not affect the critical temperature in the\nBEC regime. However, disorder introduces quantum\n(temporal) phase fluctuations in the BEC regime, where\nfermions are largely non-degenerate, particle-hole symmetry is absent, and Anderson's theorem does not apply,\nthus leading to a strong suppression of Tc .\nThe critical temperature calculated corresponds to the\ntransition between the superfluid and a non-uniform\nphase containing local superfluid islands separated from\neach other by peaks of the disorder potential. The transition from the local superfluid regime to the normal\nphase may be determined by imposing the condition that\n\n[1] T. St\u00f6ferle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 030401 (2006).\n[2] J. K.
