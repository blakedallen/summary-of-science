A sample of galaxies was drawn from the photometric redshift catalogue based on the HST/WFPC2\noptical images and the deep near-infrared images obtained with VLT/ISAAC as a part of the Faint Infrared\nExtragalactic Survey (FIRES) project. We selected galaxies with photometric redshift between 2.5 and 4. Most\nof the selected galaxies are bright in rest-frame UV wavelengths and satisfy color selection criteria of Lyman\nbreak galaxies (LBGs) at z \u223c 3. The number of target galaxies with IAB \u2264 25.0 was 15. We identified new 5\nfirm and 2 probable redshifts in addition to confirmations of previously known 6 galaxies at z \u223c 3. We found 6\namong these 13 galaxies lie at a quite narrow redshift range at z = 2.80 \u00b1 0.01. Their spatial distribution is fairly\nconcentrated and is at the edge of the HDF-S field, suggesting the possible existence of larger galaxy clustering.\nWe examined stellar populations of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts through comparisons of their optical\nand near-infrared photometry data with template spectra generated by a population synthesis code.

Introduction\nIn recent several years, there has been much progress\nin understanding the nature of galaxies at high-redshift.\nDeep imaging of blank fields and the photometric redshift\ntechnique based on multi-band photometry have enabled\na construction of large samples of high-redshift galaxies\nwhich are so faint that we need long exposures to obtain\ngood signal-to-noise spectroscopy of them. The Lyman\nSend offprint requests to: I.

The number of galaxies\nselected by the technique, so-called Lyman break galaxies\n(LBGs), amounts to an order of 103 at z \u223c 3 (e.g., Steidel\net al. 1996, 2003; Foucaud et al. 2003), and several hundreds even at z \u223c 5 (Iwata et al. 2003; Ouchi et al. 2004).\nFollow-up studies on LBGs such as optical spectroscopy\n(e.g., Teplitz et al. 2000; Pettini et al. 2001; Shapley et\nal. 2003; Ando et al. 2004) and analysis of their stellar\n\n\f2\n\nI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\npopulations using optical-to-near-infrared spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) (e.g., Sawicki and Yee 1998; Shapley\net al. 2001; Papovich et al. 2001) have been made. By\nthese studies basic properties of LBGs have been clarified;\ntheir star-formation rates amount to several tens to several hundreds M\u2299 /year, dust attenuation is fairly small\n(E(B \u2212 V ) < 0.5), their stellar populations are dominated\nby relatively young massive stars (ages less than 1 Gyr in\nmost cases) and stellar mass is an order of 1010 M\u2299 (about\n1/10 of the Galaxy).\nAlthough these studies have clearly indicated that the\nLyman break technique is a powerful method to probe\nthe star-forming galaxies at z >\n\u223c 3, the number fraction of\nLBGs among the total populations of galaxies at a redshift considered remains unclear. Since the Lyman break\ntechnique selects galaxies which show prominent discontinuity at \u03bb = 1216\u00c5 and have flat UV spectra, sample\ngalaxies are biased to actively star-forming galaxies with\nrelatively small amount of dust attenuation. Recently, several studies based on deep near-infrared imaging revealed\nsubstantial populations of massive galaxies which are faint\nin optical bands but bright in near-infrared (e.g., Franx et\nal. 2003; Daddi et al. 2004; Chen and Marzke 2004), and it\nhas been suggested that optical (i.e., rest-frame UV) based\nsamples may miss a significant amount of massive galaxies. However, due to their optical faintness, only a small\nfraction of these red galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts.\nThus current estimates of their redshift distribution and\nnumber density have large uncertainties. Moreover, since\nthe red color can be explained by both heavy dust attenuation and old stellar population, the nature of these\ngalaxies \u2013 dusty star-forming galaxies or massive galaxies\ndominated by old stellar population \u2013 is unresolved.\nThe Hubble Deep Fields (HDFs) are one of the\nmost prominent observations for the study of high-z\ngalaxies. Deep imaging covering the optical wavelengths\nby HST/WFPC2 (Williams et al. 1996; Casertano et\nal. 2000) as well as near-infrared images obtained by\nHST/NICMOS and ground-based observatories enabled\nthe photometric redshift estimation down to IAB = 27.5,\nfor both northern and southern HDFs. (e.g., Fern\u00e0ndezSoto et al. 1999; Yahata et al. 2000; Labb\u00e9 et al. 2003\n(hereafter L03); Vanzella et al. 2004). In the HDF-S we\ncarried out a deep OII+44 narrow-band imaging using\nVLT/FORS1 to examine the escape fraction of Lyman\ncontinuum from galaxies at z \u223c 3 (Inoue et al. 2005).\nAlthough precise redshift measurements were required to\nuse the narrow-band image to discuss the Lyman continuum escape fraction, in the HDF-S only a handful spectroscopic observations have been made so far (Cristiani et\nal. 2000; Vanzella et al. 2002; Sawicki and Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas\n2003; Rigopoulou et al. 2005), and in particular, the number of galaxies identified to be at z > 2.5 is still quite limited; only 2 galaxies at z > 3 and 8 galaxies at 2.5 < z < 3\nhave been reported. In order to increase the number of\nsample galaxies, we carried out spectroscopic observations\nof galaxies with photometric redshifts estimated to be at\nz \u223c 3 with VLT/FORS2. The precise redshift information\n\nis also useful to reduce the uncertainty of physical properties (stellar mass, ages, amount of dust attenuation) in\nSED fitting. In this paper we report the results of the\nspectroscopic observations. In section 2 we describe the\nsample selection, observations and data reduction. The\nresults and a discussion on a spatial distribution of sample galaxies are presented in section 3. We also investigate\nthe stellar population and star formation history of the\ngalaxies (section 4), and compare them with properties of\n\"distant red galaxies\" discovered by Franx et al. (2003)\nin section 5. A summary and conclusions of the paper are\npresented in section 6.\nThroughout the paper all magnitudes are presented in\nAB system. We adopt a set of cosmological parameters of\n(\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b , h) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.7).\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\n2.1. Sample selection and observations\nThe target field is the WFPC2 main field of the Hubble\nDeep Field - South, centered at R.A. = 22:32:56.2\nDecl=\u221260:33:02.7. The WFPC2 observations, data reduction, data quality and object detection procedures are\ndescribed in Casertano et al. (2000). Ultra-deep nearinfrared Js, H, Ks-band imaging observations using\nVLT/ISAAC have been carried out as a part of the Faint\nInfrared Extragalactic Survey (FIRES). L03 utilized their\nnear-infrared images and publicly available HST/WFPC2\noptical images to estimate photometric redshifts for faint\ngalaxies. The catalog contains 134 entries with a photometric redshift between 2.5 and 3.7. We selected a primary\nsample for spectroscopic observation with the I814 corrected isophotal magnitude brighter than 25.0. The number of galaxies satisfying the criteria was 23.\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of sample galaxies in\nthe U300 \u2212 B450 versus B450 \u2212 I814 two-color diagram. For\nthose without U300 detection, lower limits of U300 \u2212 B450\ncolors are shown. Since the selection of the sample galaxies were not based on the Lyman break method but on the\nphotometric redshift using multi-band imaging data, not\nall the sample galaxies satisfy the criteria for selection of\nz \u223c 3 LBGs defined by Madau et al. (1996). All except two\nobjects with spectroscopic redshift determinations (shown\nwith filled symbols in figure 1) satisfy the LBG color criteria (see \u00a73). Two objects with spectroscopic redshifts lying\nat the outside of the LBG color area are HDFS0001 and\nHDFS0085. These two objects locate close to the edges of\nthe WFPC2 image, and photometric errors in U300 -band\nare estimated to be \u223c 0.5mag. Thus we expect that properties of sample galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are\nquite similar to LBGs.\nWe made a multi-object spectroscopy using\nVLT/FORS2 in MXU mode.

Data reduction\nBasic data reduction steps, namely, bias subtraction\n(using overscan regions), cosmic-ray removal and flatfielding have been made using IRAF. After the registration of all frames, the images were combined using the\nIRAF/IMCOMBINE task. The sky subtraction and extraction of one-dimensional object spectra were made using an interactive program developed by one of us (I.I.).\nUsing that program a user can make a background fitting in any wavelength range and preview the result of\nsubtraction before execution.\nThe flux calibration and sensitivity correction were\nmade using spectral data of standard stars (Feige 110,\nLTT 1020 and LTT 6248) taken during the observing runs.\nFig. 1.

The galaxies for which we successfully identified their redshifts are\nrepresented with filled symbols, and those observed but\nfailed in redshift determination are shown as open symbols. Squares are for galaxies which have been detected in\nU300 -band, and triangles are for those without U300 -band\ndetection. Larger marks and smaller ones are for galaxies with I814 < 25.0 and those with 25.0 < I814 < 25.5,\nrespectively. We also show the color tracks of model starforming galaxies with and without dust attenuation as\ntwo solid lines. The model was computed assuming a constant star-formation rate and an age of 100 Myr. The left\ntrack is for the model without dust, and the right one is\nwith dust attenuation (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.4). These lines indicate how the colors of a star-forming galaxy change as\nits redshift increases. The dashed and dot-dashed curves\nare calculated using template spectra of elliptical and Sbc\ngalaxies, respectively, from Coleman et al. (1980). We put\nopen circles at redshift interval of 0.5.

On the other hand, we set some additional\nslitlets for fainter objects, i.e., 25.0 < IAB < 26.0, if\nthey did not conflict with slitlets for bright objects.\nThe final sample for spectroscopy consists of 15 galaxies with 22.9 < IAB \u2264 25.0 and 10 galaxies with\n25.0 < IAB <\n\u223c 26.0. In table 1 basic parameters of the\nsample galaxies are listed.\nThe observations were executed in service mode, on 7\nnights during 25th June to 28th July 2003. We used the\n300V grism, which provides a 1.6\u00c5 / pixel resolution over\n3300\u00c5\u2013 6600\u00c5. Slit widths were 1.7\u2032\u2032 , and the resolving\npower at 5900\u00c5 was 260. Exposure time for each shot was\n999 sec in most cases, and the total on-source exposure\ntime was 6.1 hours.\n\n3. Results of spectroscopy\n3.1. New redshift identifications\nWe firmly identified 5 new spectroscopic redshifts. All of\nthese new redshift determinations are based on the identifications of three or more spectroscopic features, such as\nLy\u03b1 emission, low-ionization absorption lines (e.g., Si ii\nand C ii), and the discontinuity of continua at 1216\u00c5.\nThey are labeled with asterisks in the sixth column of\ntable 1. In figure 2 and 3 we show the extracted onedimensional spectra of galaxies with redshift identifications. There are six galaxies with previously determined\nredshifts; one object HDFS00271 is a faint (I = 25.45)\nLy\u03b1 emitter, and the others are I < 24.4. Redshifts for\nthese objects listed in table 1 are based on our spectroscopic data, and the differences from previous studies\nare less than 0.003. There is also one galaxy HDFS10652\n(HDFS 223250.05\u2212603356.8) which we did not observe\nbut the redshift has been determined to be z = 2.652\nby Vanzella et al. (2002). Thus in total 12 galaxies with\n2.5 < z < 3.5 have been found in the HDF-S field. There\nare also two objects whose redshifts are likely to be newly\ndetermined by our observation, but the identifications are\nnot definite because the S/N of spectra was poor and only\none or two lines are firmly identifiable. We list these two\nprobable redshifts in table 1 with parentheses. For galaxies\nwhose spectra have Ly\u03b1 line as emission lines we show the\nrest-frame FWHMs and equivalent widths (EWs) in table\n1. For HDFS00565 and HDFS00526 we measured FWHMs\nand EWs for combined spectra, because their positions\nare only 2.\u2032\u2032 1 apart and spectra are blended. We tried to\nextract spectra of their central parts separately and saw\nno difference in their redshifts (z = 2.789). Because the\nsignal-to-noise ratios of spectra are poor, we could not\nmeasure EWs of absorption features.\nThe spectroscopic redshifts obtained for our sample\ngalaxies are always smaller than photometric redshifts\nestimated by L03. In Fig. 4 we show a comparison of\nspectroscopic and photometric redshifts for all galaxies in\nthe HDF-S which have a published spectroscopic redshift.\nThere is no object at z > 2 for which photometric redshift is equal to or smaller than spectroscopic redshift. On\n\n\f4\n\nI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\nFig. 4. Comparison of Spectroscopic redshifts (zspec ) and\nphotometric redshifts (zphot ) estimated by L03. The difference between the spectroscopic redshifts and photometric\nones are shown along with the spectroscopic redshift. The\nerror bars represent the differences (zspec \u2212 zphot ) in cases\nof using lower and upper limits (68% confidence level) of\nphotometric redshifts. The galaxies with firm redshifts in\nour study are shown with filled circles. Open circles represent galaxies listed in L03. Galaxies for which zspec have\nbeen measured by Sawicki and Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas (2003) are\nshown with filled squares.\n\nFig. 5. Spatial distribution of galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. Galaxies within a redshift range\n2.789 < z < 2.806 are shown as filled circles. The other\ngalaxies are shown as open circles except HDFS00085 at\nz = 3.16 which is marked as a triangle. In the spectrum\nof HDFS00085 there is a signature of Ly\u03b1 absorption systems corresponding to a HI cloud at z \u2248 2.8.\n\nthe other hand, the photometric redshifts of galaxies at\nz < 2 are systematically smaller than spectroscopic redshifts. This trend can be also seen in figure 6 of L03 but it\nis not clear due to smaller number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.\n\n3.2. Galaxy concentration at z = 2.8\nWe noticed that five among 12 galaxies with firm spectroscopic redshifts locate between a narrow redshift range\nfrom 2.789 to 2.806 (corresponding to a comoving length\nof \u223c 17.6 Mpc). In figure 5 we show the spatial distribution of 12 galaxies with known redshifts. The five galaxies\nbetween 2.789 < z < 2.806, shown as filled circles, also\nlie within a \u223c 1\u2032 \u00d7 0.\u2032 5 sky area (1\u2032 corresponds to 1.8\nMpc (comoving) at z = 2.8). In addition, in the spectrum\nof HDFS00085 at z = 3.16 (shown as a triangle in figure\n5) we identified a dump of a continuum around \u223c 4600\u00c5,\nwhich coincides with Ly\u03b1 clouds at z \u2248 2.80 (see a dip\naround 1100\u00c5 in the spectrum of HDFS0085 in figure 2).\nThis feature suggests the existence of large amount of neutral hydrogen at z \u223c 2.8 toward the direction. We also\nnote that one object among two with probable redshifts,\nHDFS01295 has an estimated redshift z = 2.798. It is also\ninteresting the existence of HDFS00565 and HDFS00526.\nThey are a pair of galaxies at z = 2.789, the most bright\ngalaxies in our sample galaxies in I-band, and they both\nshow a prominent Ly\u03b1 emission, indicating they are experiencing a massive star formation. Because the comoving\n\nvolume traced by the redshift range 2.789 < z < 2.806\nis less than 2% of the volume surveyed by the range\n2.5 < z < 3.5, the possibility that this concentration is\ncaused by chance is less than 10\u22124 if we simply assume\nthat the distribution of sample galaxies are random. From\nthese findings we think that these galaxies would be members of a real galaxy concentration at z \u223c 2.8 within a 30\nMpc3 or smaller comoving volume. The sky positions of\ngalaxies in the redshift range are located at the edge of the\nWFPC2 survey field, and it is possible that this concentration has an extension out of the surveyed area and the\nnumber of member galaxies might be larger than currently\nidentified.\nDaddi et al. (2003) examined a clustering properties of\ngalaxies with photometric redshift estimates in the catalog\nby L03, and found a concentration of galaxies with red\nJ \u2212 K color (> 1.7) at zphot \u223c 3.0. If we take account the\npossible systematic offset of their photometric redshift at\nz > 2 (see \u00a73.1), the concentration we found coincide well\nwith that by Daddi et al. (2003), although selected galaxy\ntypes would be different from each other.\n\n\fI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.

The redshifts with\nparentheses indicate that the redshift determination is not definitive. An arrow in the panel of HDFS0085 indicates a\nposition of Ly\u03b1 line at z = 2.8, which coincidents with a dump in the continuum (see section 3.2).\n\n4. Stellar Populations of Star-forming Galaxies at\nz\u223c3\n4.1. Method\nThe examination of stellar contents of star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 3 has a crucial importance on the understanding\nof their star formation history (SFH), and their connection with galaxy populations at different redshifts. Deep\nbroad-band photometric data obtained by HST/WFPC2\n\n(Casertano et al. 2000) and VLT/ISAAC (L03) covers a\nrest-frame wavelength range from 750\u00c5 to 5700\u00c5 for a\ngalaxy at z \u223c 3 with 7 bands, with which we can constrain some parameters of their stellar contents, such as\nstellar mass, SFH and amount of dust attenuation, with\nreasonable accuracy. In table 2 we list the six colors and\nI814 and Ks-band magnitudes for spectroscopic sample\ngalaxies.\n\n\f6\n\nI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\nFig. 3. Same as Fig. 2, for objects fainter than I814 >\n\u223c 24.6.\nWe used a population synthesis and evolution code\nP\u00c9GASE version 2 (Fioc and Rocca-Volmerange 1997)\nfor generating a set of template galaxy spectra. The initial\nmass function adopted is that by Salpeter (1955) with a\nmass range of 0.1 M\u2299 \u2013 120 M\u2299 . Two types of SFHs were\nconsidered, namely, a constant star-formation rate (SFR)\nand an exponentially decaying SFR. 1 P\u00c9GASE version\n1\n\nFor exponential SFH, four different values of the decaying\ntimescale \u03c4 (10Myr, 50Myr, 100Myr, 1Gyr) were adopted. In\norder to model different chemical enrichment histories, three\ndifferent SFRs relative to the total amount of baryons within\na galaxy (consuming 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 , or 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 of total\nbaryons per Myr) were considered in constant SFR models.\n\n2 takes chemical evolution into account. We started calculations of synthetic spectra of stellar populations from\nzero-metal gas. The metallicity of interstellar gas of model\ngalaxies at fitted ages is sub-solar. Although the measurements of the metallicity of LBGs still have large uncertainties, roughly a half Solar metallicity has been suggested (Pettini et al. 2001). Thus we think metallicity of\nour template spectra does not conflict with observations.\nWe also calculated spectra of galaxies forming from solar\ninitial metallicity, in order to examine the effect of metallicity on derived parameters of stellar populations. Stellar\nmass, ages and dust attenuation obtained using such high\nmetallicity models did not change so much from results\n\n\fI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\nwith low metallicity models; ages were a few dex younger\nand E(B \u2212 V ) was 0.1\u20130.2 smaller, but stellar mass did\nnot change significantly. So we think metallicity is not a\ndominant source of uncertainty in the estimation of stellar\npopulations.\nThe procedures for finding the best-fitted models and\nestimating confidence levels we adopted are same as those\nmade by previous authors (e.g., Papovich et al. 2001). The\noutputs at 26 time steps from 10 Myr to 2.5 Gyr were\nused for fitting with observed SEDs of 13 sample galaxies\n(11 with firm and 2 with probable redshifts). Before executing the fitting, the absorption by intergalactic neutral\nhydrogen for each redshift of the object was applied, using analytic formula in Inoue et al. (2005). We also varied\nthe amount of attenuation caused by dust within galaxies,\nfrom E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.0 to 1.5 with a step of 0.01, by adopting an attenuation law proposed by Calzetti et al. (2000).\nFor each template SEDs the normalization factor which\nminimize the \u03c72 static were explored. The \u03c72 is defined as\n\u03c72 =\n\nX [fobs (i) \u2212 a \u00d7 fmodel (i)]2\ni\n\n\u03c3(i)2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fobs (i), fmodel (i) and \u03c3(i) are observed flux, model\nflux and estimated observational error in band i, respectively, and a is the normalization factor. As observational\nerrors we only included photometric errors listed in the\ncatalogs. We also tested cases which incorporated additional errors possibly associated with systematic differences between observing bands. Although the resulting \u03c72\nvalues were reduced in the latter procedure, the changes in\nbest-fitting parameters and confidence levels were insignificant. For objects with Ly\u03b1 emission line, flux densities attributed to Ly\u03b1 line were estimated from our spectra and\nthey were removed from B450 -band and / or V606 -band\nflux densities. For each galaxy we recorded the \u03c72 values\ncalculated for all models, and found the best-fit model\nwhich returned the minimum \u03c72 value.\nThe 68% confidence levels were calculated by a Monte\nCarlo resampling. We randomly perturbed the observed\nfluxes, assuming the gaussian distribution of errors. The\namount of the perturbations were adjusted to match the\nphotometric errors. We executed the SED fitting for the\nset of perturbed flux densities, and the resulting SED parameters were recorded. The test was repeated 1,000 times\nfor each of sample galaxy. Then \u03c72 value to contain 68%\nof these simulated data were derived. This value was used\nto determine the range of model parameters for each object with 68% confidence level, by selecting models which\nreturn \u03c72 values smaller than that for unperturbed object fluxes. We also tested another way of the confidence\nlevel estimation with fixed \u03c72 values (i.e., without Monte\nCarlo resampling) following Avni (1976). The area sizes\ncovered by 68% confidence levels are smaller than those\nthrough Monte Carlo resampling in most cases, while for\nfainter objects the area sizes are comparable. Hereafter we\nuse the 68% confidence level areas estimated with Monte\nCarlo resampling as typical errors in our SED fitting.\n\n7\n\n4.2. Results\nIn Fig. 6 and 7 we show the results of SED fitting. In table 3 we summarized results in case of constant SFRs and\ninitial metal-free gas. Fig. 6 shows the age from the onset\nof the star formation activity and the amount of dust attenuation (in unit of color excess E(B \u2212V )). The choice of\nSFH (constant or exponentially decaying) does not make\na large difference in estimated ages and amount of dust\nattenuation for most cases. The median age and color excess of sample galaxies are 130 Myr and E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.29\nfor constant SFH, and 80 Myr and E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.27 for\nexponentially-decaying SFH. When using exponentiallydecaying SFHs, the best-fit decaying time scales are comparable to the age estimates. The median values of dust\nattenuation we derived are slightly larger than the value in\nsome of previous studies (E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.15; e.g., Shapley\net al. 2001; Steidel et al.1999; but our values are consistent\nwith those by Sawicki and Yee 1998). We think the relatively smaller amount of dust attenuation in LBGs studied by Steidel and co-workers are due to their choice of\nfilter set and color criteria. Their LBG selection criteria\nin Un \u2212 G and G \u2212 R color diagram preferentially select\ngalaxies with E(B \u2212 V ) < 0.3 (see figure 2 in Steidel et\nal. 2003). The estimated values of E(B \u2212 V ) and the distribution of our sample galaxies in two-color diagram are\nconsistent with each other (see figure 1).\nIn Fig. 7 the stellar mass estimates are plotted along\nthe estimated ages. The difference of stellar mass due to\nthe choice of SFH is again small: the median value of stellar mass is 1.9 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 and 1.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 for constant\nSFH and exponentially-decaying SFH, respectively. The\none object which has \u223c 10 times smaller stellar mass compared to other objects is HDFS0271. Because the Ks-band\nmagnitude of the objects is about 2 magnitude fainter\nthan the average of Ks-band magnitude of other objects,\nsmaller stellar mass estimate for this galaxy is reasonable.\nThe properties of stellar populations in our sample\ngalaxies obtained by the SED fitting analyses are broadly\nconsistent with the results of previous studies for LBGs\nat z \u223c 3 (e.g., Sawicki and Yee 1998; Shapley et al. 2001;\nPapovich et al. 2001).\nA critical argument over the estimates of stellar populations in high-redshift galaxies through the SED fitting\ntechnique is that there might be a missing old stellar population which is not dominant in the wavelength range\nused for the fitting but contains significant mass of lowmass stars. In order to explore such possibility, we also\ntested a SED fitting with model spectra which incorporate\ntwo components of stellar populations. One is a single-age\nstellar population burstly formed in 2 Gyr ago (z \u223c 20\nfor an object at z = 3), and the other is a stellar population formed by a constant star formation. The age and\nSFR of the latter were changed in a same way as we did\nin the fitting with a single component. The ratio of total\nbaryonic mass (including both stellar and gaseous mass)\nfor old and constant components within a model galaxy\nwere changed from 1:100 to 10:1. By this test we intended\n\n\f8\n\nI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\nFig. 6. Distribution of ages and dust attenuation estimates obtained as results of SED fitting for star-forming galaxies\nin the HDF-S. The model spectra of galaxies used for comparison were calculated assuming the constant SFRs (left)\nand exponentially-decaying SFRs (right). Galaxies with probable redshifts (HDFS01295 and HDFS0001) are shown as\nopen circles. The error bars show the range of 68% confidence levels.\n\nFig. 7. Ages and stellar mass estimates for star-forming galaxies in the HDF-S. The meanings of symbols and error\nbars are same as Fig. 6.\nto estimate the maximal amount of old stellar component\nwhich reasonably agrees with observations. For about half\nsample galaxies the best-fitted models were those with less\nthan 10% of the total stellar mass was coming from old\ncomponent. For three cases (namely HDFS 0085, 1590 and\n0001) which have stellar mass of the old component larger\nthan those from constant SF component, the total stellar mass becomes 3\u20135 times larger than the results with\nsingle component fitting. From this test we confirmed the\nresults by Papovich et al. (2001); the amount of old stellar population laying under the young, UV-bright stars\nseems to be not so large in the best-fitted models. Barmby\net al. (2004) reported the first result of SED fitting for\nLBGs using mid-infrared observation executed by IRAC\non borad the Spitzer Space Telescope, in addition to optical and near-infrared photometry. They argue that the\nstellar mass and age estimates made with and without\nmid-infrared (rest-frame near-infrared) do not differ significantly. This result also supports the idea that LBGs at\nz \u223c 3 have relatively small amount of old stellar pop-\n\nulation. Shapley et al. (2005) confirmed the insensitivity of best-fit stellar mass estimates to the inclusion of\nrest-frame near-infrared photometry for a sample of UVluminous star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 2. However, they argued that, by considering the maximal amount of old stellar components, the upper limit to stellar mass for some\nof star-forming galaxies can be > 5 times larger than the\nbest-fitted values with the constant star formation models.\nIn our SED fitting results we explored the 68% confidence\nlevels of stellar mass constraints in the same way as \u00a74.1.\nThe stellar mass of the old stellar components can be 2\u2013\n20 times larger than the best-fitted ones, and in five cases\nold stellar components can dominate > 90% of the total\nstellar mass. Thus although from best-fitted models the\namount of old stellar component is suggested to be small\nin most cases, our constraints on mass contribution from\nthe old component are not strong.\nWe should also note that the error in estimating dust\nattenuation is another possible source of uncertainty in\nSED fitting. The best way of estimating dust attenuation\n\n\fI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\nwould be through the flux ratio of far-infrared emission\nto UV radiation (e.g. Witt & Gordon 2000; Buat et al.\n2005) even for UV-selected samples like LBGs. Burgarella\net al. (2005) performed a SED analysis of nearby galaxies selected by UV or FIR fluxes in Buat et al. (2005).\nThey show that the amount of dust attenuation evaluated without the far infrared information can be wrong\nby up to 1 magnitude for UV-selected galaxies and up to\n3 magnitudes for FIR-selected galaxies. The uncertainty\nof 1 magnitude on the UV attenuation leads to the uncertainty of 0.1 magnitude on E(B\u2212V ) for the Calzetti's law.\nMoreover, it seems that the dust attenuation law varies in\nthe slope and in the strength of the 2175\u00c5 bump from\na galaxy to a galaxy. It would enlarge the uncertainty\nof E(B \u2212 V ). Such a variation of the attenuation law depending on the galaxy type was examined by Inoue (2005)\ntheoretically. He suggest that the Calzetti's law is realized\nin a large density medium which is favorable to starburst\ngalaxies like LBGs. If it is true, the assumption of the\nCalzetti's law is valid, although we need more investigations in this topic, especially with the data of the dust\ninfrared emission.\nShapley et al. (2001) examined the correlation between\nthe properties of stellar population and spectroscopic features for LBGs at z \u223c 3. They found that galaxies with\nyoung age (tsf , best fit age from the onset of the star formation, is shorter than or equal to 35 Myr) preferentially\nshow broad Ly\u03b1 absorption line and strong low-ionization\ninterstellar lines (such as Si ii and C ii), while old (tsf \u2265 1\nGyr) have strong Ly\u03b1 emission lines and weaker interstellar lines. We examined the relationship between spectroscopic features and parameters of best-fitted stellar population models in our 13 spectroscopic sample. We did not\nfind any clear correlation between the Ly\u03b1 emission, Ly\u03b1\nequivalent widths and the results of SED fitting. The absence of any clear trend may be attributed to the small\nnumber of sample galaxies in our study; the number of\ngalaxies with spectroscopic identifications in Shapley et\nal. (2001) is 81, which is more than six times larger than\nours.\n\n5. Discussion: Comparison with distant red\ngalaxies at z \u223c 3\nFranx et al. (2003) used deep near-infrared images obtained by FIRES to select galaxies which have photometric redshifts larger than 2 and have Js\u2212Ks larger than 2.3\n(Vega) in the HDF-S. They claimed that the red Js \u2212 Ks\ncolors of these galaxies might be caused by the 4000 \u00c5\nbreak and bright K-band color would indicate the existence of massive stellar population. They also roughly\nestimated the number density of these \"distant red galaxies\" (hereafter DRGs) and suggested that they might be\nas abundant as half the number density of LBGs.\nWe compared the properties of stellar population of\nour sample of star-forming galaxies and DRGs. For this\npurpose we applied a SED fitting procedure for the 13\nDRGs with K < 24.5 in the HDF-S. The method is exactly\n\n9\n\nsame as that we called \"one-component fitting\" in section\n4, except that redshifts we used for DRGs were photometric ones derived by L03. As we noted in section 3.1,\nthere might be systematic offsets in photometric redshift\nestimates by L03. To examine the effect of this redshift uncertainty in analyses of stellar contents, we executed a test\nin which we adopted redshifts \u22120.25 smaller than phot-z\nestimates. The estimated amount of dust attenuation did\nnot change significantly and for stellar masses, SFRs and\nages differences were less than 50%, mostly smaller than\n30%. We also tested fitting with \"two-components\", i.e., a\nmaximally old stellar population plus that with constant\nSFRs, and resulting parameters such as stellar masses and\ndust attenuation in young component were not so different from those by one-component fitting. Both constant\nand exponentially-decaying SFHs with various timescales\nwere tested. We show estimated ages (from the onset of\nstar formation), dust attenuation and stellar mass in figure\n8. As we did for LBG sample, we tested models with solar\ninitial gas metallicity as well as those formed from metalfree gas, and found that differences in obtained parameters\nwere smaller than 68% confidence ranges. As seen in the\nfigure, the ages of DRGs are hardly constrained. The 68%\nconfidence range of estimated ages for some objects even\nspan over an order of magnitude. Such less accurate age estimates for DRGs as compared with those for LBGs would\nbe attributed to DRGs' optical faintness. Also DRGs are\nrelatively abundant in low-mass stellar population, which\nis less sensible for ages. Given the large uncertainty of\nage estimation, the best-fitted ages of DRGs are on average larger than those of LBGs. The median age of our\nDRG sample is 1.6 Gyr, several times longer than that\nof LBGs. The amount of dust attenuation is also systematically larger for DRGs. Although we mentioned before\n(section 4.2), the use of single attenuation law may lead\nthe error of \u223c0.1 mag in the estimation of E(B \u2212 V ), for\nLBGs best fitted values of E(B \u2212 V ) are always not larger\nthan 0.5, while for DRGs E(B \u2212 V ) often exceeds 0.5. So\na systematic difference between E(B \u2212 V ) for LBGs and\nDRGs seen in figure 8 would be real.\nThe errors of estimated stellar mass derived from\nMonte-Carlo resampling were smaller than 0.3 dex, regardless of large uncertainty of age estimates. It is because stellar mass is largely dependent on the fluxes in the\nnear-infrared (rest-frame optical) wavelengths. The stellar mass of DRGs are 1010 \u2013 1012 M\u2299 , and the median\nvalue is 9.4\u00d71010M\u2299 for the constant SFR models. DRGs\nhave systematically larger stellar masses than our sample\nLBGs. We should beware that, unlike the DRG sample,\nour LBG sample is not complete in K-band magnitude.\nThus with current data set we cannot exclude the possible existence of LBGs which are missed in our sample due\nto the faintness in rest-frame UV and have stellar mass\ncomparable to DRGs. On the other hand, SFRs of DRGs\nare fairly large and comparable to those of LBGs: in the\ncase of constant SFR models, all best-fit models have a\nfew tens to a few hundreds M\u2299 per year. In the case of\nexponentially-decaying SFH, 7 among 13 have on-going\n\n\f10\n\nI. Iwata et al.: Galaxies at z \u223c 3 in the HDF-S\n\nSFRs larger than 10 M\u2299 per year and three among the\nremaining six objects have 1 < SFR < 10 in units of M\u2299\nper year.\nThese results of SED fitting imply that many of\nDRGs are not passively evolving galaxies. DRGs would\nbe more likely dusty galaxies with relatively large SFRs,\nand they have already accumulated stellar mass more than\n1010 M\u2299 . These results of SED fitting for DRGs are consistent with some recent studies by other investigators.\nF\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. (2004) used a sample of DRGs\nfrom MS 1054\u221203 field as well as HDF-S for SED fitting\nusing template spectra generated with a population synthesis code by Bruzual and Charlot (2003). The parameters of stellar populations they obtained agree well with\nours.\nIf the number density of DRGs is as large as a half\nof LBGs' number density, the stellar mass density at\nz \u223c 3 based on UV-selected galaxies would be significantly underestimated. Indeed, predictions based on cosmological numerical simulations have suggested the stellar mass density at redshifts larger than 2 is larger than\nobservational estimations using UV-selected sample (e.g.,\nNagamine et al. 2004). However, because near-infrared\nsurveys deep enough to detect DRGs are still covers only\na tiny area of the sky (smaller than several tens of square\narcmin), uncertainty due to the cosmic variance would be\nlarge. In addition, they are faint in optical wavelengths\nand spectroscopic follow-up observations are much difficult than LBGs. Upcoming wide-field near-infrared instruments would much broaden survey area and increase\nthe number of spectroscopically identified DRGs, which\nwould be indispensable to derive reliable number density\nof DRGs.\n\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nWe made an optical spectroscopy of star-forming galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field - South with photometric\nredshift estimated to be at z \u223c 3. Five firm redshifts\nand two probable redshifts have been newly determined\nin addition to the confirmations of six galaxies with previously known redshifts. Six objects among them lie within\n\u223c30 Mpc3 comoving volume, suggesting the existence of\na galaxy concentration.\nWe investigated stellar populations of sample galaxies\nusing optical to near-infrared broad-band imaging data.\nBy the comparisons with template spectra we obtained\nbest-fit parameters. Typical ages are 20\u2013200 Myr, and\nstellar mass is (0.5\u20135) \u00d71010 M\u2299 . These results are consistent with previous studies on stellar populations of LBGs,\nand we confirmed that stellar content of UV selected starforming galaxies are dominated by young, massive stars\nand dust attenuation is smaller than E(B \u2212 V ) < 0.5.\nWe found no significant correlation between properties of\nstellar populations and UV spectral features, in our 11\nconfirmed and 2 possible sample galaxies.\nA comparison of stellar contents in LBGs and DRGs in\nthe HDF-S were also made. We found that DRGs tend to\n\nhave larger values than our UV-luminous LBGs for stellar masses and dust attenuation, and that SFRs in many\nof DRGs and LBGs are comparable. Majority of DRGs\nwould be one of the most massive, actively star-forming\npopulations at z >\n\u223c 2. If the number density of DRGs is\ncomparable with that of LBGs, current estimates of cosmic star formation rates and stellar mass density at z \u223c 3\nbased on UV-selected sample would be largely underestimated. To reach a rigid conclusion of the comparison\nbetween LBGs and DRGs and to draw a complete picture\nof the galaxy evolution in a high-redshift, we need deep\nand wide surveys in near-infrared wavelengths.\nAcknowledgements.

Summary of results of spectroscopic observations. The running IDs and designations are taken from the\nversion 2 of HST/WFPC2 catalog of the HDF-S (Casertano et al. 2000). I814 is a corrected isophotal magnitudes in\nF814W filter, also from Casertano et al. (2000), and Ks-band magnitudes are 'total' magnitudes (see Labb\u00e9 et al.\n2003 (L03)). Photometric redshifts (zph ) are from the catalog made by L03. The spectroscopic redshifts obtained by\nour observations are also listed (zsp ). Asterisks denote that the redshifts were determined by our observations for the\nfirst time. The redshifts with \u2020 were based solely on the central wavelengths of Ly\u03b1 lines, and two redshifts embraced\nwith parentheses were uncertain due to the poor SN of the spectra. For galaxies with Ly\u03b1 emission lines the rest-frame\nFWHMs and equivalent widths (EW) are also listed (both units are \u00c5).\n\nID\n00565\n00526\n00059\n00085\n01590\n00153\n01295\n02376\n00066\n01825\n00001\n01512\n00271\n\nI814\n22.928\n23.293\n23.953\n24.064\n24.156\n24.349\n24.542\n24.594\n24.607\n24.643\n24.760\n25.228\n25.449\n\nKtot\n22.679\n22.706\n23.450\n23.192\n23.340\n22.538\n23.464\n23.749\n23.076\n23.800\n21.916\n22.999\n25.432\n\nU \u2212B\n3.677\n3.657\n>2.765\n1.541\n3.211\n4.150\n2.733\n2.273\n2.353\n>2.431\n1.608\n3.402\n1.994\n\nB\u2212V\n0.467\n0.523\n0.937\n0.658\n0.200\n0.565\n0.783\n0.403\n0.656\n0.830\n0.444\n0.828\n0.253\n\nV \u2212I\n0.196\n0.185\n0.464\n0.168\n0.112\n0.192\n0.272\n0.163\n0.299\n0.207\n0.662\n0.360\n0.171\n\nI\u2212K\n\u22120.387\n0.121\n0.012\n0.478\n0.176\n0.725\n0.449\n0.345\n0.696\n0.250\n1.722\n1.161\n\u22120.294\n\nJ \u2212H\n0.155\n0.524\n0.527\n1.134\n0.516\n1.089\n0.813\n0.556\n0.912\n0.764\n1.071\n1.046\n0.248\n\nH \u2212K\n\u22120.032\n0.007\n0.263\n0.939\n0.039\n0.181\n0.247\n0.077\n0.238\n0.525\n0.435\n0.147\n0.415\n\nzsp\n2.789\n2.789\n2.945\u2217\n3.170\u2020\n2.364\n2.794\n(2.798)\n2.408\u2217\n2.801\u2217\n3.275\u2217\n(2.472)\u2020\n2.670\u2217\n2.806\u2020\n\nTable 2.
