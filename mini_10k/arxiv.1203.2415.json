I NTRODUCTION\nIn the last decades, quantum control has known significant\nimprovements both at theoretical and practical levels (cf.[1],\n[2], [3], [4] and references therein). Results have been\nobtained on existence of controls [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] or efficient ways to compute and carry out laser fields that achieve\nsome goals concerning the state of quantum systems [10],\n[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. On the other hand, the design of\nrelevant laser fields plays also a major role when the goal\nis to identify some properties of the quantum system to be\ncontrolled. In this way, some methods have been designed\nto identify finite dimensional systems characteristics [16], or\nto compute discriminant laser fields [17].\nNote that operator identification in relation to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation has already been studied in the literature. As an example, we refer to [18] for a theoretical result,\nwhere no laser interaction is considered.\nIn this paper, we focus on the case where only one\nfixed laser is used to identify in finite given time the free\nHamiltonian and the dipole moment. From the theoretical\npoint of view, we obtain a local existence result: we prove\nthat the inversion is always possible in the neighborhood of\nsome particular states. As a by-product, we emphasize some\nfeatures of the laser fields that enables the identification.\nFollowing the local approach we use to obtain this result,\nwe present in a second part, a time discretized setting and\nfixed-point methods to solve numerically our problem. In\nparticular, a Newton method is proposed together with a\ncontinuation method that allows us to solve problems where\nthe local assumption does not hold.\nThis paper is organized as follows: the mathematical\nformulation of our problem is given in Section II and a\nlocal controllability result is presented in Section III.

We conclude with some tests in\nSection V.\nLet us finally introduce some notations concerning particular matrix sets that will be used throughout the paper.\nGiven Nd \u2208 N, we denote by CNd ,Nd and RNd ,Nd the sets of\nmatrices of size Nd \u00d7 Nd with complex and real coefficients\nrespectively. Then, define\n\b\nU = M \u2208 CNd ,Nd , M \u2217 M = M M \u2217 = Id ,\n\b\nS = M \u2208 CNd ,Nd , M \u2217 = M ,\n\b\nSR = M \u2208 RNd ,Nd , M \u2217 = M ,\n\b\nSR0 = SR \u2229 M \u2208 RNd ,Nd , Mk,k = 0, k = 1, . . . , Nd ,\nwhere M \u2217 denotes the adjoint matrix associated to M and\nId is the identity matrix of CNd ,Nd . Here, for the sake of\nsimplicity, we have omitted the dependence of these sets\nwith respect to Nd . In what follows, we denote by Rz and\nIz denote respectively the real and imaginary parts of a\ncomplex number z. Given a matrix M , we denote by M T\nits transposed.\nII. S ETTING\n\nOF THE PROBLEM\n\nFix T > 0, and consider a system U (t) \u2208 U whose\ndynamics over [0, T ] is ruled by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\niU\u0307 (t)\n\n=\n\nU (0) =\n\n[H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03bc]U (t),\n\n(1)\n\nUinit ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H0 \u2208 SR is the matrix of the internal Hamiltonian,\n\u03b5(t) \u2208 L2 (0, T ; R) a laser field, \u03bc \u2208 SR the matrix\nassociated with the dipole moment. For relevant applications,\nthe matrices H0 and \u03bc are not supposed to commute. The\ninitial state Uinit is fixed. In this equation, \u03b5 is given and the\npair (H0 , \u03bc) \u2208 SR \u00d7 SR0 is searched such that at time t = T ,\nthe state reaches a given target state Utarget , i.e.,\nU (T ) = Utarget .\n\n(3)\n\nIn other words, given the mapping\n\u03c6 : SR \u00d7 SR0\n(H0 , \u03bc)\n\n\u2192 U\n7\u2192 U (T ),\n\nthe main question that will be investigated in this paper is\nthe surjectivity of \u03c6.\nIn our work, the internal Hamiltonian H0 is searched as\nreal Hermitian (i.e. symmetric) matrix. This is a particular\nsituation as in general it is only supposed to be complex\nHermitian and not real. Nevertheless, for the applications\nwe have in mind this restriction is very natural since the\nHamiltonian is a sum of a kinetic operator and a potential,\n\n\fboth real. For the same reasons, we suppose that the dipole\nmoment \u03bc is real (Hermitian thus symmetric) but we assume\nmoreover that the diagonal elements are null. This additional\nassumption is motivated both by invariance properties (the\ndiagonal of H0 as matrix commutes with the diagonal of\n\u03bc as matrix) but also by the desire to identify an unique\npair (H0 , \u03bc) since in this way the number of unknowns\n(dimension of SR plus that of SR0 ) equals the number of\nequations (the dimension of U).\nNote that one can easily prove the following conservation\nproperty:\n\u2200t \u2208 [0, T ], kU (t)kU = kUinit kU ,\nwhere we have denoted by k * kU the norm associated to the\nscalar product\n(A, B) \u2208 U \u00d7 U 7\u2192 tr(A\u2217 B).\nThis problem is related to inverse problems in quantum\ncontrol [17], but unlike previous works, we do not aim here\nat designing relevant laser fields to identify the pair (H0 , \u03bc)\nbut rather to investigate the properties of the fields \u03b5(t)\nthat make Equation (3) invertible and algorithms to compute\nnumerically the corresponding solution operators H0 and \u03bc.\nIII. L OCAL\n\nCONTROLLABILITY RESULT\n\nIn this section, we present some theoretical results about\nthe local inversion of Equation (3). More precisely, we make\nuse of the calculus of variations to obtain a local inversion\ntheorem.\nGiven a pair (H0 , \u03bc), we first introduce the tangent space\nAH0 ,\u03bc , which is the space of matrices defined by:\n\b\nAH0 ,\u03bc = M \u2208 CNd ,Nd , M \u2217 U (T ) + U (T )\u2217 M = 0 .\n\nwith \u039b the diagonal matrix with coefficients \u03bba \u2208 R, a \u2208\nNd , 1 \u2264 a \u2264 Nd . Suppose that for a 6= b, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 Nd , 1 \u2264\nb \u2264 Nd ,\n\u03bba\n\n6=\n\n\u03b5\u0302ia,b\n\n:=\n\nSR \u00d7 SR \u2192 AH0 ,\u03bc\n(\u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc) 7\u2192 \u03b4U (T ),\n\nwhere \u03b4U (T ) is solution at time t = T of the linearized\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation:\n \u0307 (t) = [H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03bc]\u03b4U (t) + [\u03b4H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03b4\u03bc]U (t),\ni\u03b4U\nand U (t) follows equation (1).\nWe will prove that \u03c6 is an onto mapping using the fact\nthat d\u03c6 also satisfies this property. This strategy is motivated\nby the following known result:\nTheorem 1: Supposed that d\u03c6(H0 , \u03bc) is an onto mapping,\ni.e.\n\u2200V \u2208 AH0 ,\u03bc , \u2203(\u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc), d\u03c6(H0 , \u03bc)(\u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc) = V.\nThen \u03c6 is locally onto in a neighborhood of (H0 , \u03bc).\nWe shall prove that d\u03c6 is an onto mapping on the neighborhood of all states of the form U0 := \u03c6(H0 , 0) \u2208 U. To do\nthis, we compute explicitly an inverse mapping.\nTheorem 2: Given H0 \u2208 SR , define V0 as the matrix that\ndiagonalizes U0 := \u03c6(H0 , 0) in the following way:\nT\n\nU0 (t) = V0\u2217 ei\u039b(t\u2212 2 ) V0 ,\n\nI\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n\u03b5(t)e\n\ni\u03b4\u03bba,b (t\u2212 T2\n\n)\n\ndt\n\n0\n\n!\n\n(4)\n6= 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThen d\u03c6(H0 , 0) is an onto mapping and its inverse is given\nby:\n\u03c8 : V \u2032 \u2208 AH0 ,\u03bc 7\u2192 (\u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc).\nThe matrices \u03b4H0 and \u03b4\u03bc are given by:\n\u03b4H0 := V0\u2217 \u03b4 H\u03030 V0 , \u03b4\u03bc := V0\u2217 \u03b4 \u03bc\u0303V0 ,\nwhere the coefficients ha,b and ma,b of the matrices \u03b4 H\u03030\nand \u03b4 \u03bc\u0303 are given by:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nma,b\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nha,b\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nma,a\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 h\n\n=\n\nIva,b\n\u03b5\u0302ia,b\nRva,b \u2212\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\u0302ra,b\nIva,b\n\u03b5\u0302ia,b\n\nsin(\u03b4\u03bba,b\n= 0,\n2\n=\nva,a\nT\n\na,a\n\nT\n)\n2\n\n\u03b4\u03bba,b\n\nif a 6= b\n\n(6)\n\nif a = b.\n\nHere va,b , a, b \u2208 Nd , 1 \u2264 a \u2264\u0010 Nd are the coefficients\n\u0011 of\nRT\nT\niV0\u2217 U0 (T )\u2217 V \u2032 V0 and \u03b5\u0302ra,b := R 0 \u03b5(t)ei\u03b4\u03bba,b (t\u2212 2 ) dt .\nProof: We fix V \u2032 \u2208 AH0 ,\u03bc and solve\nd\u03c6(H0 , 0)(\u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc) = V \u2032 .\n\nWe then consider the differential operator of \u03c6 defined by:\nd\u03c6(H0 , \u03bc) :\n\n\u03bbb\n\n(7)\n\nFirst, one can show the identities:\n\u03c6(H0 , \u03bc)\u2217 d\u03c6(H0 , 0)(\u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc) = U0 (T )\u2217 \u03b4U0 (T )\nZ T\n= \u2212i\nU0 (t)\u2217 (\u03b4H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03b4\u03bc)U0 (t)dt,\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nwhere the variation \u03b4U0 is defined by the evolution equation:\n \u0307 0 (t) = [H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03bc]\u03b4U0 (t) + [\u03b4H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03b4\u03bc]U0 (t). (9)\ni\u03b4U\nNote that such an identity holds also when \u03bc 6= 0. Since\nU0 (T )\u2217 is invertible, showing that (7) has a solution is\nequivalent to show that\nZ T\nU0 (t)\u2217 (\u03b4H0 + \u03b5(t)\u03b4\u03bc)U0 (t)dt = V,\n(10)\n0\n\nhas a solution, with V := iU0 (T )\u2217 V \u2032 \u2208 S since V \u2032 \u2208\nAH0 ,\u03bc .

We have:\n(Id + Ln )\u03b4Un+1 + \u03b4Ln Un+1\n\n\u2212\u03b4Ln Un ,\n\u03b4Ln (Un+1 + Un ) = (Id \u2212 Ln )\u03b4Un\n\n0\n\nsin(\u03b4\u03bba,b\n=\n\nha,b\n\n\u03b4\u03bba,b\n\nT\n)\n2 + m \u03b5b(\u03b4\u03bb ),\na,b\na,b\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03bba,b\n=\n\u03bba \u2212 \u03bbb and\nRT\ni\u03b4\u03bba,b (t\u2212 T2 )\ndt = \u03b5\u0302ra,b + i\u03b5\u0302ia,b .\n0 \u03b5(t)e\nIn the case a = b, one finds that\nva,a = ha,b\n\n\u03b5b(\u03b4\u03bba,b )\n\nT\nT\n+ ma,b \u03b5b(0) = ha,b + ma,b\n2\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2212(Id + Ln )\u03b4Un+1 ,\n\u2217\n(Un+1 + Un ) \u03b4Ln (Un+1 + Un ) = \u22122(Un+1\n\u03b4Un+1\n\u2217\n\nT\n\n\u03b5(t)dt.\n\n0\n\n\u2200(a, b) 6= (a\u2032 , b\u2032 ), \u03bbb \u2212 \u03bba 6= \u03bbb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bba\u2032 ,\nand is in practice often satisfied. Condition (5) deals with\nthe laser field itself. It is a non-resonant condition to control\nthe system.\nMETHODS\n\nIn this section, we present two algorithms to solve (3). The\nstrategy we follow is a direct adaptation of previous results\nand proofs: we consider local approximations based on fixed\npoint iterative solvers. In our approach, a crucial step consists\nin obtaining an appropriate time discretized version of (1).\nIn the first part, we build such an approximation that enables\nthe exact computation of the derivative of the final state\nU (T ) with respect to (H0 , \u03bc) and derive from this setting\na numerical strategy.\nA. Time discretization\nIn order to simulate numerically Equation (1), we introduce the following time discretization: give NT \u2208 N, we\nT\ndenote by \u2206T =\nthe time step and for n = 0, * * * , NT\nNT\nby Un and \u03b5n the approximations of U (n\u2206T ) and \u03b5(n\u2206T ).\nIn order to preserve the unitary property of the matrices U (t)\nat the discrete level, we use a Crank-Nicholson scheme ruled\nby the formula:\ni\n\nUn+1 + Un\nUn+1 \u2212 Un\n= (H0 + \u03b5n \u03bc)\n.\n\u2206T\n2\n\nThe corresponding iteration is then given by:\n(Id + Ln )Un+1 = (Id \u2212 Ln )Un ,\n\n\u2212Un\u2217 \u03b4Un ),\n\n=\n\nNote that the assumption \u03b4H0 , \u03b4\u03bc \u2208 SR combined with\n\u03b5b(\u03b4\u03bba,b ) = \u03b5b(\u03b4\u03bbb,a ) implies that va,b = v\u0304b,a , so that V \u2208 S.\nThe result follows.\nRemark 1: In this theorem, we have defined ma,a arbitrarily.\nThis theorem gives a first hint about conditions required to\nidentify (H0 , \u03bc). Condition (4) is weaker to the standard nondegeneracy condition\n\nIV. N UMERICAL\n\n= (Id \u2212 Ln )\u03b4Un\n\nwhere \u03b4Ln =\n\u2217\nUn+1\n\u03b4Un+1\n\ni\u2206T\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n(\u03b4H0 + \u03b5n \u03b4\u03bc). This finally gives rise to:\n\nUn\u2217 \u03b4Un\n\n(Un+1 + Un )\u2217\nUn+1 + Un\n(\u03b4H0 + \u03b5n \u03b4\u03bc)\n.\n2\n2\nSince the initial value is fixed, we obtain:\n= \u2212i\u2206T\n\n\u2217\n\u03b4UNT\nUN\nT\nNX\nT \u22121\n\n=\u2212i\u2206T\n\nn=0\n\n(Un+1 + Un )\u2217\nUn+1 + Un\n(\u03b4H0 + \u03b5n \u03b4\u03bc)\n.\n2\n2\n(11)\n\nThis result can be seen as a discretized version of (8) where \u03bc\nis not necessarily null. We insist on the fact that such a result\nis specific to the Crank-Nicholson discretization. As far as we\nknow, no other numerical solvers give rise to discretization\nof (8) where the variations \u03b4H0 and \u03b4\u03bc are explicit.\nB. Fixed points methods\nWe now present some iterative solvers to compute solutions of (3).\n1) A Newton Method: In the discrete setting, we still\ndenote by \u03c6 the operator:\n\u03c6:\n\nSR \u00d7 SR0 \u2192 U\n(H0 , \u03bc) 7\u2192 UNT .\n\nTo solve the equation \u03c6(H0 , \u03bc) = Utarget , a Newton method\nwould consist in the following iteration:\n\u0001\nd\u03c6(H0k , \u03bck ) * (\u03b4H0k , \u03b4\u03bck ) = \u2212 \u03c6(H0k , \u03bck ) \u2212 Utarget ,\n(12)\nwhere k is the iteration index, \u03b4H0k = H0k+1 \u2212 H0k , \u03b4\u03bck =\n\u03bck+1 \u2212 \u03bck .\nIn our case, (12) reads:\nk\nk\n.\n= Utarget \u2212 UN\n\u03b4UN\nT\nT\n\nUsing (11), one can rewrite this equation as follows:\n\u2206T\n\nNX\nT \u22121\nn=0\n\nk\nU k + Unk\n(Un+1\n+ Unk )\u2217\n(\u03b4H0k + \u03b5n \u03b4\u03bck ) n+1\n2\n2\n\u0001\nk\n)\u2217 Utarget \u2212 Id ,\n= i (UN\nT\n\nwhere we recall that the unknowns are \u03b4H0k and \u03b4\u03bck . This\nequation has generally no solutions, since its left hand side\nbelongs to S what is not the case for its right hand side.\n\u0001 To\nk\n\u2217\nsolve this problem, we replace i (UN\n)\nU\n\u2212\nId\nby\ntarget\nT\n\n\fa first order approximation S k \u2208 SR . Two possible choices\nare:\nk\n)\u2217 Utarget\nexp(\u2212iS k ) := (UN\nT\n\n(13)\n\nk\n\u2217\nk\n(UN\n)\u2217 Utarget \u2212 Utarget\nUN\nT\nT\n. (14)\nS k := i\n2\nIn the numerical tests, the same behavior is observed when\nusing the first or the second definition.\nRemark 2: The previous method can be simplified to\nobtain a procedure where no matrix needs to be assembled\nand the inverted during iterations. Instead of up-dating at\neach iteration in the pair (H0 , \u03bc) in the term d\u03c6(H0 , \u03bc)\nof Formula (12), one can keep a constant approximation\n(H0ref , \u03bcref ) of the solution. We denote by (Unref )n=0,*** ,NT\nthe corresponding sequence of states. The iteration then\nreads:\n\n\u2206T\n\nNX\nT \u22121\nn=0\n\nref\n+ Unref )\u2217\n(Un+1\nU ref + Unref\n(\u03b4H0k + \u03b5n \u03b4\u03bck ) n+1\n2\n2\n\n= Sk,\n\nwhere S k is defined in the previous section, see (13) and (14).\nNote that such an algorithm is actually a time-discretized\nversion of the fixed point used in the proof of Theorem 2,\nexcept that here \u03bc is not supposed to be null.\n2) Implementation of the iterative solvers: Both previous\nmethods require inversions of linear systems which are not\ngiven explicitly in our formulations. To fill in this gap, we\nexplain here how to assemble the matrices, i.e. to rewrite the\nequation\n\u2206T\n\nNX\nT \u22121\nn=0\n\nUn+1 + Un\n(Un+1 + Un )\u2217\n(\u03b4H0 + \u03b5n \u03b4\u03bc)\n= S,\n2\n2\n\nin terms of linear system. In what follows, we denote by\nXM the vector representation of a matrix M consisting in\nconcatenating vertically its columns. A first step to do this\nis to note that the later equation reads as follows:\n!\n!\nNX\nNX\nT \u22121\nT \u22121\n\u2206T\nMUn+1/2 X\u03b4H0+\u2206T\n\u03b5n MUn+1/2 X\u03b4\u03bc\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\n= XS , (15)\n\nwith\n\u2217\nT\n). \u00d7 kron(Un+1/2\n, 1Nd ).\nMUn+1/2 = kron(1Nd , Un+1/2\n\nHere, kron denotes the Kronecker product, Un+1/2 =\nUn+1 +Un\n, the term by term product of two matrices A and\n2\nB is denoted by A. \u00d7 B and 1Nd denotes the matrix of\nRNd ,Nd whose coefficients are equal to 1.\nA second step must then be carried out: since the matrices\n\u03b4H0 and \u03b4\u03bc are symmetric, one has to consider the columns\nof the matrices in (15) that correspond to the coefficients\nof \u03b4H0 located, e.g., above the diagonal and the coefficients\nof \u03b4\u03bc located strictly above the diagonal. In the same way,\nonly the lines of the resulting system that correspond to\nthe coefficients located above the diagonal of S shall be\nconsidered.\n\nTaking the real and the imaginary part of the equations,\nthe resulting system is of size Nd4 .\nC. A continuation method for global controllability\nThe algorithms proposed in Section IV-B are only locally\nconvergent. The purpose of this section is to present a\ncontinuation method that enables to extend their range of\napplication.\nAs mentioned above, numerous methods exist to solve the\ncontrol problem where the laser term \u03b5 in Equation (1) is\nunknown and H0 and \u03bc are given [15], [11], [10]. Based\non this fact, the method we propose is the following. Given\n0\nan initial guess (H00 , \u03bc0 ), find a control \u03b50 such that UN\n,\nT\n0\n0\nthe final state associated to (H0 , \u03bc ) correctly approximates\nUtarget . Given \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1] , we define the interpolated fields\n\u03b5\u03b8 = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03b50 + \u03b8\u03b5. A fixed point method as the one\npresented in Section IV-B can then be applied with (H00 , \u03bc0 )\nas an initial guess to solve the operator control problem with\n\u03b5\u03b8 . Our algorithm consists in repeating this procedure by\nsolving iteratively the operator control problem associated to\nthe field \u03b5k\u03b4\u03b8 using (H0k\u22121 , \u03bck\u22121 ) as initial guess. Carrying\nthis procedure up to \u03b8 = 1 enables to solve the original\nproblem.\nV. N UMERICAL\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this last section, we present some numerical results\nobtained with the algorithms of the previous sections. As\na laser term in Equation (1), we use \u03b5(t) = sin(t). The other\nnumerical data are Nd = 5, T0 = 10, NT = 102 , T = 2\u03c0T0\nand \u2206T = T /N .\nA. Newton Method\nWe first test our Newton method. In this way, we choose\nrandomly a pair (H0 , \u03bc), with coefficients in [\u22121, 1] and\ncompute the corresponding final state UNT . Then, we start\nthe Newton procedure with an initialization (H0 + \u2206H0 , \u03bc +\n\u2206\u03bc) where (\u2206H0 , \u2206\u03bc) are also chosen randomly. An example of computation is given in the next table.\nIteration\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nlog10 (kH0k \u2212 H0 kU )\n-1.579029\n-3.003599\n-4.339497\n-8.234980\n-13.963299\n-14.022486\n\nlog10 (k\u03bck \u2212 \u03bckU )\n-1.358376\n-2.865026\n-4.122528\n-8.179398\n-14.029020\n-14.131066\n\nHere, we refind a pair (H0 , \u03bc) starting from a 10%\nrandom perturbation. We see that the numerical convergence\nis obtained after 6 iterations. Note also that the quadratic\nconvergence is observed.\nB. Continuation method\nIn a second test, we use the continuation method presented in IV-C to tackle a problem where the algorithms of\nSection IV-B do not apply. Given a target Utarget obtained\nwith the field \u03b5 and a pair (H0 , \u03bc) that is chosen randomly,\nwe look for the operators H0\u2032 and \u03bc\u2032 that solve the control\n\n\fproblem associated to the field cos(3t) and the target Utarget .\nThe direct use of the Newton method of Section IV-B does\nnot work: in this case, the algorithm does not converge. The\ncontinuation method enables to solve this problem. Using\n\u03b4\u03b8 = 1/4, and 10 iterations of the Newton method as inner\nloop, a relevant pair (H0\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 ) is obtained.\nThis example has been reproduced for numerous random\ninitial pairs (H0 , \u03bc).\nR EFERENCES\n[1] A.
