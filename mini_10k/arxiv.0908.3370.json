The standard geometrically\nthin, optically thick accretion disc model can successfully explain\nmost of the observational features in active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nand X-ray binaries (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). In the standard thin\nmodel, the motion of the matter in the accretion disc is nearly Keplerian, and the gravitational energy released in the disc is radiated away locally. An alternative accretion disc model, namely, the\nadvection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model, was suggested\nfor the black holes accreting at very low rates (Ichimaru 1977;\nNarayan & Yi 1994). In the ADAF model, only a small fraction\nof the gravitational energy released in the accretion flow is radiated\naway due to inefficient cooling, and most of the energy is stored\nin the accretion flow and advected to the black hole. The ADAFs\nare optically thin and hot (comparable with the virial temperature\nof the gases in the flows), which radiate mostly in X-ray waveband (see Narayan & McClintock 2008, for a review and references\ntherein). This model can successfully explain the main observational features of black hole X-ray binaries and low-luminosity\nAGN (LLAGN) (e.g., Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995a; Gammie et al.\n1999; Quataert et al. 1999; Yuan et al. 2003; Ho 2008). As the\nBernoulli parameter of an ADAF is positive, the ADAF is likely\nto have an outflow, which was confirmed by numerical simulations and also supported by observations (Stone & Pringle 2001;\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:lisl@shao.ac.cn\n\u2020 E-mail:cxw@shao.ac.cn\n\nIgumenshchev et al. 2003; McKinney 2006; Gammie et al. 1999;\nQuataert et al. 1999; Yuan et al. 2003).\nBlandford & Begelman (1999) proposed a self-similar\nadvection-dominated inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS) for the\nADAF with winds. In ADIOS model, the mass accretion rate is no\nlonger a constant and is assumed to be a power-law dependence\nof radius (\u1e41 \u221d r s , 0 < s < 1), which is an important ingredient\nin most of the follow-up works (e.g., Quataert & Narayan 1999;\nYuan et al. 2003; Xue & Wang 2005). Motivated by the results\nof numerical simulations on accretion discs, Xie & Yuan (2008)\ninvestigated the influence of outflows on the accretion flow based\non a 1.5-dimensional description of the accretion flow. They\nsuggested that their solutions can be described by a power-law\nr-dependent mass accretion rate fairly well.\nMagnetic fields are believed in accretion flows, and the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) provides the source of viscosity in accretion flows (Balbus & Hawley 1991, 1998). The\noutflows/jets can be driven by the large-scale ordered magnetic\nfields threading the accretion disc (Blandford & Payne 1982). The\nphysics of magnetically accelerated outflows has been extensively\nexplored in many previous works (e.g., Cao & Spruit 1994; Cao\n2002; Kudoh & Shibata 1995; Koide, Shibata, & Kudoh 1999;\nKato, Kudoh, & Shibata 2002; Ogilvie & Livio 1998, 2001;\nNarayan, McKinney, & Farmer 2007; McKinney & Narayan\n2007a,b). Such outflows/jets magnetically driven from the accretion discs provide an efficient angular momentum loss mechanism\nfor accretion discs (see Spruit 2008, for a review and references\ntherein). The structure of a standard thin disc/ADAF may be altered\nby the magnetically driven outflows (e.g., Li, Wang, & Gan 2008;\n\n\f2\n\nS. Li and X. Cao\n\nLi, Gan, & Wang 2009). In this work, we investigate the global\nstructure of an ADAF with magnetically driven outflows/jets.\n\n2 MODEL\nWe consider a steady ADAF with magnetically driven outflows/jets\nsurrounding a black hole in this work.\nThe continuity equation is\nd\n(2\u03c0R\u03a3vR ) + 4\u03c0R\u1e41w = 0,\n(1)\ndR\nwhere vR is the radial velocity, \u03a3 = 2H\u03c1 is the surface density of\nthe accretion flow, and \u1e41w is the mass loss rate from unit surface\narea of accretion flow. The half-thickness of the disc H is given\nby H = cs /\u03a9K , and \u03a9K is the Keplerian angular velocity. The\nsound speed cs = (P/\u03c1)1/2 , and the total pressure P is the sum\nof the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure: P = Pgas + Pm =\nPi + Pe + Pm (Pi and Pe are the ion pressure and the electron\npressure respectively).\nIn this work, we adopt the Paczy\u0144ski\u2013Wiita potential\n\u03c8=\u2212\n\nGM\nR \u2212 Rg\n\n1 dP\ndvR\n\u2212 R(\u03a92 \u2212 \u03a92K ) +\n\u2212 gm = 0,\ndR\n\u03c1 dR\n\n(3)\n\nBrs Bz\n,\n(4)\n2\u03c0\u03a3\nwhere Brs and Bz are the radial and vertical components of the\nmagnetic fields at the disc surface.\nThe angular momentum equation reads\n\ngm =\n\nd(\u03a9R2 )\nd\n1\nTm\n\u2212\n(R2 H\u03c4r\u03c6 ) +\n= 0,\ndR\n\u03c1HR dR\n\u03a3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1-viscosity \u03c4r\u03c6 = \u2212\u03b1P is adopted (Shakura & Sunyaev\n1973), and Tm is the magnetic torque exerted on the accretion flow\ndue to the outflows/jets. The outflow is accelerated by the magnetic\nfields threading the rotating accretion disc, and therefore the torque\nTm can be calculated with\n2\nTm = 2\u1e41w \u03a9(Rd )(RA\n\u2212 Rd2 ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u1e41w is the mass loss rate due to the outflow, Rd is the radius\nof the footpoint of the field line, and RA is the Alfv\u00e9n point (see,\ne.g., Cao 2002, for the details).\nThe energy equations for ions and electrons are given by\n\u03c1vR (\n\nd\u03b5e\nPe d\u03c1\n2\u1e41w \u03b5e\n\u2212 2\n) \u2212 \u03b4q + \u2212 qie + q \u2212 +\n= 0,\ndR\n\u03c1 dR\n2H\n\n(7)\n\nPi d\u03c1\n2\u1e41w \u03b5i\nd\u03b5i\n\u2212 2\n) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)q + + qie +\n= 0,\ndR\n\u03c1 dR\n2H\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\u03c1vR (\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b5i =\n\nkTi\n1\n,\n\u03b3i \u2212 1 \u03bci mH\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Te and Ti are the temperature of electrons and ions respectively, and the mean molecular weight of the ions and the electrons:\n\u03bci = 1.23, \u03bce = 1.14 are adopted. The adiabatic indices of the\nelectrons and ions, \u03b3e and \u03b3i , are given by\n\u03b3 e = 1 + \u03b8e\n\n\u03b3 i = 1 + \u03b8i\n\nrespectively, where the parameter \u03b4 describes the fraction of the\nviscously dissipated energy that goes directly into electrons in the\naccretion flow, and the specific internal energy of electrons and ions\nare given by\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u22121\n\n3K3 (1/\u03b8e ) + K1 (1/\u03b8e )\n\u22121\n4K2 (1/\u03b8e )\n\n\u0015\u22121\n\n3K3 (1/\u03b8i ) + K1 (1/\u03b8i )\n\u22121\n4K2 (1/\u03b8i )\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere K , s are the modified Bessel functions, and the dimensionless electron and ion temperature are defined as: \u03b8e = kTe /(me c2 )\nand \u03b8i = kTi /(mp c2 ) (Narayan & Yi 1995b). The energy dissipation rate per unit volume is given by q + = \u2212\u03b1P Rd\u03a9/dR, and\nqie indicates the energy transfer rate from ions to electrons through\nCoulomb collisions, which is given by (Stepney & Guilbert 1983)\nqie =\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the angular velocity of the accretion flow.

However, the generation and maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields\nof the disk is still quite unclear (e.g., Lubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle\n1994a,b; Tout & Pringle 1996). In this work, we focus on how the\ndynamics of the ADAF is affected by the presence of magnetically driven outflows/jets. For simplicity, we assume that largescale magnetic field lines thread the accretion disk, and the strength\nof the magnetic fields far from the disc surface along the field line\nto be roughly self-similar:\nBp (R) \u223c Bpd\n\n\u0010\n\nR\nRd\n\n\u0011\u2212\u03b6\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Rd is the radius of the field footpoint at the disc surface,\nBpd is the strength of the poloidal component of the field at the\ndisc surface, Bp (R) is the field strength at R along the field line,\nthe self-similar index \u03b6 > 1 (Blandford & Payne 1982), and \u03b6 =\n4 is adopted in the calculations of Lubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle\n(1994b).\nThe\nself-similar\nwind\nsolution\nderived\nby\nLubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle (1994b) is only valid for slowly\nmoving (non-relativistic) outflows, which was extended for relativistic jets by Cao (2002). In this work, we model the magnetically\ndriven outflows/jets with the approach adopted in Cao (2002). We\nsummarize the model as follows (see Cao 2002, for the details).\nFor a relativistic jet accelerated by the magnetic field of the\ndisc, the Alfv\u00e9n velocity is (Michel 1969; Camenzind 1986)\n\n\fGlobal dynamics of ADAFs with outflow\nvA =\n\nBpA\n(4\u03c0\u03c1A \u03b3j )1/2\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere BpA and \u03c1A are the poloidal field strength and the density of\nthe outflow/jet at Alfv\u00e9n point, and \u03b3j is the Lorentz factor of the\nbulk motion of the outflows/jets. In this work, all our calculations\nof the outflows/jets are in the special relativistic frame. The Alfv\u00e9n\nvelocity vA \u223c RA \u03a9(Rd ), where RA is the radius of the Alfv\u00e9n\npoint along the field line, and \u03a9(Rd ) is the angular velocity of the\naccretion flow at the field footpoint Rd .\nThe mass and magnetic flux conservation along the field line\nrequires\n\u1e41w\n\u03c1A vA\n,\n\u2243\nBpd\nBpA\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u1e41w is the mass loss rate in the outflow/jet from unit surface\narea of the disc.\nThe final bulk velocity of the magnetically driven outflow/jet\nis \u223c vA , so the Lorentz factor of the outflow/jet is\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03b3j \u2243 1 \u2212\n\n\u0010 v \u00112 \u0015\u2212 21\nA\n\nc\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nCombining equations (14)\u2013(17), the mass loss rate in the outflow/jet from the unit surface area of the disc is\n2\nBpd\n\u1e41w =\n4\u03c0c\n\n\u0014\n\nRd \u03a9(Rd )\nc\n\n\u0015\u03b6\n\n\u03b3j\u03b6\n(\u03b3j2\n\n\u2212 1)(1+\u03b6)/2\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThe origin of the ordered magnetic fields threading\nthe disc is still unclear. It was suggested that the magnetic fields can be generated through dynamo processes\nin the disc (e.g., Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Tout & Pringle\n1996; Armitage 1998; Romanova et al. 1998), or the largescale external magnetic fields are transported inward by\nthe accretion flow (e.g., Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Ruzmaikin 1976;\nLubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle 1994a; Spruit & Uzdensky 2005).\nFor simplicity, we assume the strength of the large-scale magnetic\nfields threading the disc to be comparable with that of the fields in\nthe accretion disc, Bpd \u2243 B. The magnetic pressure is conventionally assumed to be proportional to the gas pressure in the accretion\nflow. Thus, we have\nPm =\n\nB2\n1\u2212\u03b2\n=\nPgas ,\n8\u03c0\n\u03b2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure, B is\nthe strength of the magnetic fields in the accretion flow.\nThe magnetically driven outflow is described by the terminal\nvelocity of the outflow (Alfv\u00e9n velocity vA ) when the values of two\nparameters \u03b6 and \u03b2 are specified.\n\n3 RESULTS\nWe use the Runge-Kutta method to solve a set of five differential\nequations (1),(3),(5),(7) and (8) for five variables: \u03c1, vR , \u03a9, Te and\nTi with suitable boundary conditions at the outer radius Rout . In\nour calculations, we adopt the black hole mass M = 108 M\u2299 for\na typical AGN. The conventional values of the disc parameters:\n\u03b1 = 0.1 and \u03b4 = 0.1, are adopted in all our calculations. The temperature of the ADAF at the outer radius is adopted as described by\nthe self-similar solution of Narayan & Yi (1995b). We use a shooting point method in our calculations. Integrating these five equations from the outer boundary of the flow at R = Rout inwards\n\n3\n\ntoward the black hole, we can obtain the global structure of the\naccretion flow passing the sonic point smoothly to the black hole\nhorizon by tuning the value of radial velocity at Rout . The outer\nradius of the accretion flow Rout = 5000Rg is adopted. We find\nthat the structure of the ADAF is insensitive to the outer boundary\nconditions. As discussed in Sect. 2, the magnetically driven outflow\nis described by vA , \u03b6 and \u03b2. The terminal bulk velocity of the outflow is comparable with the Alf\u00e9n velocity vA . For any unbounded\noutflows, its bulk velocity should & vK , which implies vA & vK .\nThe mass accretion rate at the outer radius, \u1e40 = 10\u22125 \u1e40Edd\n(the Eddington rate is defined as \u1e40Edd = 1.5 \u00d7 1018 M/M\u2299\ng s\u22121 ), is adopted for the calculations plotted in Figs. 1\u2013 3. In Fig.\n1, the global solutions for the ADAFs with outflows are shown with\ndifferent magnetic field strengths and distributions (i.e., different\nvalues of \u03b2 and \u03b6), in which vA = vK is adopted. In the left panel\nof Fig. 1, the radial velocity and the sound speed as functions of\nradius with different values of \u03b2 are plotted for \u03b6 = 1. In the right\npanel of Fig. 1, the mass accretion rates as functions of radius are\nplotted for the global solutions with different values of \u03b2 and \u03b6.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot different quantities of ADAF solutions with\n\u03b6 = 1 and 4, respectively, where vA = vK and \u03b2 = 0.9 are\nadopted. As comparison, we also plot the ADAF solutions without outflows in the same figure. In the calculations, the terminal\nvelocity of the outflow is a free parameter. We compare the global\nADAF solutions with different values of vA (i.e., vA = vK and\nvA = 2vK ) in Fig. 3 with \u03b2 = 0.9 and \u03b6 = 1. In Figs. 4\u20136, we\nplot the results calculated with a relatively high mass accretion rate,\n\u1e410 = 10\u22122 , at the outer radius of the disc.\nThe ratio of the bolometric luminosity of accretion disc Lbol\nto kinetic power of outflows Pk,w is calculated with\nLbol\n=\nPk,w\n\nZ\n\nRout\n\nq \u2212 4\u03c0RHdR/\n\nRin\n\nZ\n\nRout\n\n(\u03b3j \u2212 1)\u1e41w c2 4\u03c0RdR.(20)\n\nRin\n\nWe plot the ratio Lbol /Pk,w as functions of magnetic field strength\n\u03b2 in Fig. 7, where vA = vK is adopted.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nA fraction of gases in accretion flow is carried away by the magnetically driven outflow, which leads to mass accretion rate of the\naccretion flow decreasing towards the black hole. In many previous works, the outflow is induced by assuming the mass accretion rate \u1e41 to be a power-law dependence of radius \u1e41\u221dr s (e.g.,\nBlandford & Begelman 1999). In this work, we obtain global solutions of ADAFs with magnetically driven outflows. Our results\nshow that the mass accretion rate \u1e41 decreases towards the black\nhole, which is close to a power-law r-dependence at larger radii,\nwhile it deviates from a power-law r-dependence in the inner region of the ADAF close to the black hole (see Figs. 1 and 4). The\nlarge-scale magnetic fields are assumed to thread the accretion flow,\nwhich are believed to accelerate the outflow from the accretion disc.\nIn this work, the magnetic strength at the disc surface is described\nby a parameter \u03b2, which is limited by the gas pressure in the accretion flow. For comparison, we also plot power-law r-dependent\naccretion rates in Fig. 1. Our calculations show that the mass loss\nrate in the outflow cannot be very high even if the magnetic fields\nof the ADAF are very strong (see Fig. 1), i.e., the mass loss rate\nin the outflow is less than a power-law r-dependent accretion rate\nwith s . 0.73. We also calculate the cases with high accretion\nrate, \u1e41 = 10\u22122 , at the outer radius. It is found that the results are\nqualitatively similar to those with \u1e41 = 10\u22125 .\n\n\f4\n\nS. Li and X.

The global solutions of ADAFs with magnetically driven outflows with different parameters. The black and red lines in the left figures are for the\nradial velocity vR and the sound speed cs respectively. The dotted lines represent power-law r-dependent mass accretion rates with different values of s. The\naccretion rate at the outer radius (rout = 5000) is: \u1e410 = 10\u22125 .\n\nFor the ADAFs with magnetically driven outflows, the structure of the accretion flow is significantly altered in the presence of\nthe outflow. We find that both the ion and electron temperatures of\nthe ADAF decrease with increasing mass loss rate in the outflow\n(see Figs. 2 and 3). This is due to the fact that a fraction of the\ngravitational energy released in the accretion flow is tapped to accelerate the outflow, which decreases the heating of the ADAF. It is\neasy to understand that the ratio Lbol /Pk,w increases with decreasing magnetic field strength (see Fig. 7). Based on the magnetically\ndriven outflow model described in Sect. 2, the kinetic power of the\noutflow Pk,w can be estimated with\n\nPk,w \u221d\n\n(R\u03a9)\u03b6\n1\n2\n\u1e41w vA\n\u221d \u03b6\u22121 ,\n2\nvA\n\n(21)\n\nin the non-relativistic limit. It is found that the kinetic power of the\noutflow decreases with increasing terminal outflow velocity, which\nleads to the structure (e.g., temperatures) of ADAFs is less altered\nby the outflows with higher terminal velocity (see Figs. 3 and 6).\nIn our present calculations, the magnetic field strength is estimated with the gas pressure in the ADAF, which is true for the\nfields generated with dynamo processes (see, e.g., the discussion\nin Livio et al. 1999).

The ordered magnetic fields may be maintained\nby the drag-in process in the accretion disc, in which the magnetic\nfield strength is determined by the balance of the advection and diffusion of the fields in the disc (e.g., Lubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle\n1994a). The magnetic fields can therefore be stronger than the\nequipartition limit, however, the detailed physics is still quite\nunclear (e.g., Lubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle 1994b; Cao & Spruit\n2002; Spruit & Uzdensky 2005; Guan & Gammie 2009). In this\ncase, the value \u03b2 (see Eq. 19) describing the magnetic field strength\nmay vary with radius, which is determined by the balance between\nthe diffusion and advection of the fields in the accretion flow (e.g.,\nLubow, Papaloizou, & Pringle 1994b). The mass loss rate in the\noutflow can be higher than the results presented in this work, if the\nadvection of the magnetic fields by the accretion flow is dominant\nover the diffusion in the disc.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work is supported by the NSFC (grants 10773020, 10821302\nand 10833002), the CAS (grant KJCX2-YW-T03), and the National Basic Research Program of China (grant 2009CB824800).\nS.-L.
